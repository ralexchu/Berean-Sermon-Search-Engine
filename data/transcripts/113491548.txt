[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.880]   [Pause]
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:10.320]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you, Lord God, for this day.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:11.900]   We thank you for the rain.
[00:00:11.900 --> 00:00:16.680]   And I know that there are so many people, Lord, especially in our area that has been
[00:00:16.680 --> 00:00:20.920]   praying, the farmers, Lord God, who are in desperate need for this.
[00:00:20.920 --> 00:00:23.640]   And we thank you for answering prayers.
[00:00:23.640 --> 00:00:28.760]   We thank you, Lord God, for just your goodness of all the things, Lord, that you pour onto
[00:00:28.760 --> 00:00:32.560]   us, and many times, Lord, that we overlook.
[00:00:32.560 --> 00:00:39.880]   Help us, Lord God, to be men and women who recognize your gift, that every single day
[00:00:39.880 --> 00:00:45.360]   that we live, that we may know and appreciate that it's only by your grace, Lord God, we
[00:00:45.360 --> 00:00:47.280]   can be sustained.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:51.400]   Help us, Lord, as we come to worship you and spend time in your word and to praise and
[00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:55.840]   to give that all of these things, Lord, would simply be a reflection of the true worship
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:57.960]   taking place in our hearts.
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:00:59.560]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:03.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:08.120]   As you guys know, again, I was only gone for about seven or eight days, but again, whenever
[00:01:08.120 --> 00:01:12.680]   I leave and I get to see so many things, there's a sensory overload.
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:15.400]   And so those of you who've been out to missions, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:18.660]   To me, it felt like I've been gone for a month, but even though I've only missed two Sundays
[00:01:18.660 --> 00:01:21.780]   in about eight days.
[00:01:21.780 --> 00:01:26.640]   Pastor Peter Chung, who used to be our education pastor here, and then he was sent out as a
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:32.200]   missionary and then now he's serving as a vision coordinator for Compassion International.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:37.240]   And he invited me to come to Philippines to participate in a vision trip to see what Compassion
[00:01:37.240 --> 00:01:39.000]   is doing and how they are helping.
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.340]   And I was thoroughly impressed with how they're running their organization, how the money's
[00:01:43.340 --> 00:01:45.560]   being used, accountability.
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:48.840]   And the thing that I was mostly impressed with is how they're working through the local
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:53.640]   church and how the money is not only being used to get children out of poverty, but how
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.600]   they're working through the local church and how many of these children and their parents
[00:01:58.600 --> 00:02:01.880]   and their siblings end up coming to Christ as a result of their work.
[00:02:01.880 --> 00:02:06.280]   And so we were able to visit different parts of the Philippines and different churches
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:13.320]   and see the gospel ministry really, even though it's presented as, you know, getting children
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:17.040]   out of poverty, the bigger work really is the gospel ministry.
[00:02:17.040 --> 00:02:20.380]   And I was able to see that and I was really encouraged.
[00:02:20.380 --> 00:02:24.180]   And again, we asked him that when he's going to come here in February because his wife
[00:02:24.180 --> 00:02:31.000]   is pregnant with twins and she's going to be here from February to October, I think.
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:35.840]   And then so she's going to prepare, deliver and then recover all of that while here.
[00:02:35.840 --> 00:02:40.440]   Because Peter, Peter Chang, he's actually travels quite a bit, so he won't be able to
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   be with her.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:44.240]   So it'd be a good idea for him to, for them to be here.
[00:02:44.240 --> 00:02:48.640]   But he's going to come in February and I asked him, again, I have to talk to the elders,
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.100]   but again, so he'll give a little bit more presentation of what's going on.
[00:02:52.100 --> 00:02:56.580]   Maybe it's something that we can pray about getting involved with, about maybe supporting
[00:02:56.580 --> 00:02:59.200]   children and things like that.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:03.680]   Going out to the Philippines obviously was a tremendous blessing for me.
[00:03:03.680 --> 00:03:07.360]   And I knew that I was going to be able to see a lot of things and they deliberately
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:12.560]   took us to what they call extreme poverty, not just poverty, but extreme poverty.
[00:03:12.560 --> 00:03:18.820]   So we were taken to different homes in different places in parts of Philippines where they're
[00:03:18.820 --> 00:03:23.260]   struggling and none of that really surprised me because I went there expecting that.
[00:03:23.260 --> 00:03:28.000]   You know, I've been to different parts of the world where I've seen poverty, I've seen
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   extreme poverty.
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:32.140]   And so none of that stuff really was shocking to me.
[00:03:32.140 --> 00:03:38.860]   But what was shocking, what I didn't expect is to run into so many of the sex trafficking
[00:03:38.860 --> 00:03:39.860]   that's happening.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:44.180]   And again, it wasn't happening in front of us, but we ended up staying in a Western hotel
[00:03:44.180 --> 00:03:48.640]   because we were in areas, visiting areas where there was a lot of poverty and a lot of churches
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:50.300]   reaching out to the children.
[00:03:50.300 --> 00:03:55.160]   But because we were in a Western hotel, we saw a lot of Westerners coming in and it didn't
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:03:56.260]   hit any of us.
[00:03:56.260 --> 00:04:00.100]   And I was there with about 10 other pastors and it didn't hit any of us until about the
[00:04:00.100 --> 00:04:02.100]   second or third day.
[00:04:02.100 --> 00:04:07.980]   And we started noticing a lot of old men, 50s, 60s, maybe even 70 year old men with
[00:04:07.980 --> 00:04:09.700]   young teenage girls.
[00:04:09.700 --> 00:04:13.660]   And they must have been, if they were old, they must know more than maybe about 18, 19
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:18.780]   years old, young, maybe as young as 15 or 14.
[00:04:18.780 --> 00:04:20.020]   And it wasn't just one or two.
[00:04:20.020 --> 00:04:21.660]   We were running into them in the restaurant.
[00:04:21.660 --> 00:04:26.880]   We were running into them in the elevator, in the lounge.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.940]   And it was just very open.
[00:04:29.940 --> 00:04:34.060]   In fact, one of the guys actually joked with us because we were sitting around a bunch
[00:04:34.060 --> 00:04:36.260]   of pastors at late at night talking.
[00:04:36.260 --> 00:04:39.780]   One guy came in and he said, "Hey, you guys want to go and have fun with us?"
[00:04:39.780 --> 00:04:41.100]   And they were drinking.
[00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:44.220]   And so we just kind of laughed it off and a bunch of pastors sitting around talking
[00:04:44.220 --> 00:04:45.580]   about ministry.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:48.220]   And then they were coming trying to get us to go with them.
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:04:49.460]   And we're just kind of laughing it off.
[00:04:49.460 --> 00:04:55.060]   The next thing we see is two young, very young Filipino girls walking and going out with
[00:04:55.060 --> 00:04:56.060]   them.
[00:04:56.060 --> 00:04:59.340]   And that's when it kind of hit us what was happening.
[00:04:59.340 --> 00:05:03.540]   And again, all of this stuff is happening because of poverty.
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.860]   And they're not there doing this forcefully.
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:10.480]   It's happening because a lot of the families don't have any other options.
[00:05:10.480 --> 00:05:15.980]   So a lot of times a young girl will go and sell herself to these older men to get enough
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:16.980]   money.
[00:05:16.980 --> 00:05:21.380]   And they're not going to using this money to buy better cars or live in a nice house.
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.220]   A lot of times it's just to buy medicine.
[00:05:24.220 --> 00:05:28.500]   That somebody has pneumonia and they don't have enough money for medicine.
[00:05:28.500 --> 00:05:34.060]   The only way to get enough money to pay for this is for one of the girls to go sell themselves.
[00:05:34.060 --> 00:05:38.300]   And I didn't hear this myself, but Pastor Peter said in his previous trips, he had one
[00:05:38.300 --> 00:05:40.340]   man stand up and give a testimony.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:44.100]   And every church we went to, they were giving testimonies of what was happening and how
[00:05:44.100 --> 00:05:45.620]   they received the Lord.
[00:05:45.620 --> 00:05:50.620]   And he said one man stood up and gave a testimony of how before he met the Lord, he took his
[00:05:50.620 --> 00:05:56.980]   13 year old daughter and basically gave her to a Russian man to have sex with her.
[00:05:56.980 --> 00:06:01.000]   And then he took that money and he basically went drinking with it.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:04.780]   And he was confessing how filthy and dirty he was and how God forgave his sins.
[00:06:04.780 --> 00:06:07.820]   And again, he was crying and he was sharing this story.
[00:06:07.820 --> 00:06:12.100]   And he shared another story about a young girl who was part of the program and she dropped
[00:06:12.100 --> 00:06:14.260]   out and didn't show up for a while.
[00:06:14.260 --> 00:06:16.100]   So they were wondering what happened.
[00:06:16.100 --> 00:06:21.500]   So they went and found the parents and found out that the parents ended up selling her
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:24.700]   to a Middle Eastern man and took her basically as a slave.
[00:06:24.700 --> 00:06:28.260]   And the parents did that because they felt like that was the only way that the rest of
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:30.140]   the family could survive.
[00:06:30.140 --> 00:06:35.820]   Now this is again heart wrenching stories, but these things are happening routinely all
[00:06:35.820 --> 00:06:37.780]   over the world.
[00:06:37.780 --> 00:06:42.060]   You and I happen to be living in an area of the world where it's just shocking to hear
[00:06:42.060 --> 00:06:43.060]   this.
[00:06:43.060 --> 00:06:45.520]   But when you're in the midst of this, to them it's everyday life.
[00:06:45.520 --> 00:06:48.160]   That's the only way that they know how to survive.
[00:06:48.160 --> 00:06:51.380]   And that's the sin of what we see around us.
[00:06:51.380 --> 00:06:56.220]   But again, ultimately the problem is not poverty in itself.
[00:06:56.220 --> 00:06:58.940]   We can get sidetracked and think, well, here's these problems.
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:06:59.940]   We have money.
[00:06:59.940 --> 00:07:03.700]   We can put some money into that and we can fix this problem.
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:06.300]   Those things are only symptoms.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.060]   Whether it's sex trafficking or whether it's pornography or extreme poverty, whatever it
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:13.580]   may be, all of these things, it's not one.
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:19.300]   Wars, rumors of wars, all of these things are symptoms of what the scripture says about
[00:07:19.300 --> 00:07:21.940]   the fallen world.
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:26.780]   And that's why Paul is telling Timothy, he said, yes, you may end up forfeiting your
[00:07:26.780 --> 00:07:28.860]   life.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.420]   And there's tremendous consequence of being a light in the dark world.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:36.020]   But you are on the right path, Timothy.
[00:07:36.020 --> 00:07:39.940]   And he tells Timothy, he said, watch out because these men who have gone before you, they're
[00:07:39.940 --> 00:07:42.420]   not speaking the truth.
[00:07:42.420 --> 00:07:47.580]   They're producing false gospels, maybe even false miracles to divide the church, to confuse
[00:07:47.580 --> 00:07:54.140]   the church because our enemy knows that the church loses its strength once we are confused.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:08:02.300]   So he tells Timothy, these people in chapter 2, 2 Timothy 3.13, these people are imposters.
[00:08:02.300 --> 00:08:06.380]   They will go from bad to worse, deceiving and being deceived.
[00:08:06.380 --> 00:08:11.500]   And Jesus continues to tell us to remain, continue steadfastly.
[00:08:11.500 --> 00:08:15.040]   And he tells Timothy, that's not you, Timothy.
[00:08:15.040 --> 00:08:20.300]   Sometimes we can get so caught up in our little world and we get so entangled with our immediate
[00:08:20.300 --> 00:08:22.100]   problems.
[00:08:22.100 --> 00:08:25.820]   And of course, if you can't pay your bills and if you're having a hard time taking care
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:31.620]   of your family, it's understandable that that becomes our primary focus.
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:38.420]   But sometimes when that's all we see and we don't see the larger picture of why we are
[00:08:38.420 --> 00:08:42.900]   here this morning to worship this God.
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:47.420]   You're not at a church that's teaching you that if you believe in Jesus and if you pray
[00:08:47.420 --> 00:08:51.420]   enough, and if you do the right things enough, that God's going to bless your business, he's
[00:08:51.420 --> 00:08:54.780]   going to make you healthy, he's going to give you many, many children.
[00:08:54.780 --> 00:08:56.040]   That's a lie.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:08:57.780]   That's not what the scripture says.
[00:08:57.780 --> 00:09:00.940]   And I don't think any of you are here for that reason.
[00:09:00.940 --> 00:09:04.480]   You are, you're hearing the truth because you're, you're hearing and seeing and studying
[00:09:04.480 --> 00:09:06.700]   the word of God.
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:11.180]   But sometimes we can get so caught up in our little concerns and our little business that
[00:09:11.180 --> 00:09:17.700]   we're, that we get so entangled with, that we don't see the larger picture of why Christ
[00:09:17.700 --> 00:09:26.300]   came and why we worship him and why we are constantly reminded to proclaim him.
[00:09:26.300 --> 00:09:29.300]   Not simply because that's the right thing to do.
[00:09:29.300 --> 00:09:33.060]   It's not simply because that's what a good Christian does or because God, we want God
[00:09:33.060 --> 00:09:35.020]   to hear our prayers.
[00:09:35.020 --> 00:09:39.960]   Ultimately, because it's just common sense.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:50.160]   If we truly believe that the answer to all the suffering of mankind is Christ crucified,
[00:09:50.160 --> 00:09:56.100]   then the natural response would be to proclaim him, to cling to him, to make sure that other
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:10:02.800]   people know of him, and to be constantly reminded week after week, day after day, this is why
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:04.940]   I live.
[00:10:04.940 --> 00:10:06.600]   This is why I go to school.
[00:10:06.600 --> 00:10:08.640]   This is why I make money.
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:10.520]   And this is what I want to do when I raise children.
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:14.520]   I don't want my children to be raised and think like, if you grow up and have a nice
[00:10:14.520 --> 00:10:19.400]   job and get a great job and pay bills and able to have a great vacation, I've done my
[00:10:19.400 --> 00:10:20.400]   job.
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:25.320]   Because that's not my goal and neither should it be yours.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:31.640]   If we are genuine followers of Jesus Christ, and he tells Timothy, "Timothy, that is not
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:32.640]   you."
[00:10:32.640 --> 00:10:36.360]   And he's been telling Timothy to follow my example.
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:42.480]   And Paul repeatedly says it over and over again, "Follow me as I follow Christ.
[00:10:42.480 --> 00:10:45.760]   Follow me as I follow Christ."
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:51.080]   You know, one of the things that I feel bad for my children being raised in California
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:53.400]   is that they don't get to see snow.
[00:10:53.400 --> 00:10:58.240]   You know, the closest that they've ever seen snow was when we were driving to Victorville,
[00:10:58.240 --> 00:11:00.440]   going to their uncle's house, and there's snow falling on the freeway.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:01.800]   And that's about it.
[00:11:01.800 --> 00:11:04.080]   And we've gone, of course, we've gone to the mountains to see snow.
[00:11:04.080 --> 00:11:10.400]   But after it's fallen and all the dirt and junk is on there and they're trying to make
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:13.560]   snowman out of half dirt, half snowman.
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:14.560]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:14.560 --> 00:11:15.960]   That's the closest they've gotten to see snow.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   But I remember whether it was when I was younger in Korea or living in Philadelphia, we had
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:23.320]   such bad snow storms.
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:27.360]   And I probably, in history, they'll probably say that was one of the worst snow storms
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:30.360]   ever and how all the adults had such a hard time.
[00:11:30.360 --> 00:11:33.880]   And our school was closed for a month.
[00:11:33.880 --> 00:11:38.160]   And maybe for them it was bad memories, but for me it was great memories.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:41.640]   One because the school was closed down for a whole month.
[00:11:41.640 --> 00:11:46.280]   But secondly, seeing a lot of snow when you're a young kid, you know, that's fun.
[00:11:46.280 --> 00:11:51.040]   And I remember when I was a young kid, after the snow fell, you know, you try to go outside
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.040]   and you walk.
[00:11:52.040 --> 00:11:55.280]   And again, when you're too small, obviously, you have to be very careful.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:12:00.640]   So, the way we would walk on the snow is to see where the adults went and stepped.
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:03.120]   Because they're heavier and they know where they're going.
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.600]   So all the steps that they took.
[00:12:04.600 --> 00:12:08.760]   So in order for us to be able to function in the snow, we'd have to find the footsteps
[00:12:08.760 --> 00:12:10.160]   that have gone before us.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:13.400]   And we would step on those places because if we step on anywhere else, we may slip and
[00:12:13.400 --> 00:12:14.400]   fall.
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:18.360]   Well, that's the kind of image that I see when Paul is telling Timothy.
[00:12:18.360 --> 00:12:24.120]   He says, where the steps that Jesus took was the steps that the apostles were taking.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:26.680]   The steps that the apostles were taking, he was telling Timothy.
[00:12:26.680 --> 00:12:29.040]   Isn't that exactly what he says in Timothy?
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:33.760]   Things you heard from me, commit to other men who will be able to teach others.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:38.120]   In other words, the steps that I'm taking, you come after me so that the others who are
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:40.000]   coming come after you as well.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:46.120]   And the older and older I get, it's not something that I'm trying to do, but the older and older
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:50.680]   I get, it's hard for me not to think about how my behavior affects my children.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:54.520]   Now, I've been a pastor for a long time.
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:59.320]   And so the reality of my behavior affecting the church, and that's always been obvious,
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:01.200]   even in my early twenties.
[00:13:01.200 --> 00:13:05.480]   But now that I have children, I have one who is preparing to go to college, and I'm thinking
[00:13:05.480 --> 00:13:10.160]   to myself, the footprints that I have left behind for my kids.
[00:13:10.160 --> 00:13:13.800]   And I'm starting to think even for our church, what will the next generation of Christians
[00:13:13.800 --> 00:13:14.800]   look like?
[00:13:14.800 --> 00:13:18.360]   How will the things that we do today, what kind of impact will it make on them?
[00:13:18.360 --> 00:13:21.560]   Now, I'm not a grandparent, so I can't go beyond that.
[00:13:21.560 --> 00:13:24.680]   Because that's as far as I've gone.
[00:13:24.680 --> 00:13:32.240]   But our thinking, our application, the things that, not just what I said, but how I lived,
[00:13:32.240 --> 00:13:37.360]   what I valued, what I did when I didn't have to prepare sermons.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:39.120]   What will my children remember of me?
[00:13:39.120 --> 00:13:43.760]   What are the footsteps, what are the footprints am I leaving behind?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:46.760]   Paul says he lived with a clear conscience.
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:51.680]   And that's why he was able to say with a clear conscience to Timothy, he says in verse 10,
[00:13:51.680 --> 00:13:56.600]   however have followed, you however, Timothy, were not like those people.
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.840]   That's not where you've been going.
[00:13:57.840 --> 00:13:59.000]   You've been following me.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.680]   My teaching, my conduct, my aim in life, my faith, my patience, my love, my steadfastness,
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:11.320]   my persecutions and suffering have happened to me in Antioch, Iconium, and Lystra.
[00:14:11.320 --> 00:14:16.360]   On the surface, it may sound like arrogance, but in reality, that's what discipleship ultimately
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:17.360]   is.
[00:14:17.360 --> 00:14:19.760]   Discipleship is not simply a program.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:23.040]   You have nine months, and if you teach them this, this, this, and this, that they're going
[00:14:23.040 --> 00:14:27.160]   to be discipled and they're going to be followers of Jesus Christ.
[00:14:27.160 --> 00:14:33.000]   Discipleship ultimately is an imitation of the one that is being discipled.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   That they're just going to follow you and they're going to do what you do.
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:39.360]   That's what discipleship ultimately is.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:43.960]   We can't be a teacher if we're not living like a teacher.
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:48.160]   We can't tell them what the scripture says if the scripture is not being manifested in
[00:14:48.160 --> 00:14:49.160]   my life.
[00:14:49.160 --> 00:14:50.160]   And that's what Paul is saying.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:53.800]   Follow me as I follow Christ.
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:57.760]   What you and I do has consequences.
[00:14:57.760 --> 00:14:59.640]   It has consequences.
[00:14:59.640 --> 00:15:05.360]   If you have children, no matter how much you tell them God is important, if they don't
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.040]   see it in your life, that's not what they're going to learn.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:16.720]   No matter how much you tell them how important your walk with God is, if they don't see it,
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:22.360]   if they don't see you taking the steps before them, that's not what they're going to learn.
[00:15:22.360 --> 00:15:27.640]   It's important for us to live day to day knowing not only for our children, but for the next
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:29.140]   generation.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:34.100]   When I am gone, when you are gone, what will the children, what will the kids in our nursery,
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.720]   how will they be running this church?
[00:15:35.720 --> 00:15:37.980]   What are the things they are going to value?
[00:15:37.980 --> 00:15:42.080]   When they are adults in this church in 20, 30 years from now, what kind of decisions
[00:15:42.080 --> 00:15:44.280]   will they make?
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:46.640]   What are they going to value?
[00:15:46.640 --> 00:15:51.700]   It's important for us as a church to be able to say in every generation, look at the footprints
[00:15:51.700 --> 00:15:53.920]   that were left behind.
[00:15:53.920 --> 00:16:00.960]   You know, I'm so thankful that as a young believer, I was surrounded by committed Christians.
[00:16:00.960 --> 00:16:03.120]   Now theologically they were all over the place.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.840]   I had charismatic Presbyterians, Armenians, I mean all over the place.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:11.400]   In fact, one of the first pastors I really respected and loved to hear was a woman pastor.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:14.360]   I used to drive down to Northridge to hear her speak.
[00:16:14.360 --> 00:16:19.000]   And so when I came to Biola and I started wrestling with this, you know, complementarianism,
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:22.840]   I really struggled with it for about two years, you know.
[00:16:22.840 --> 00:16:28.520]   I mean, but I had people in my life that set an example in their life, in their conduct,
[00:16:28.520 --> 00:16:30.300]   in preaching.
[00:16:30.300 --> 00:16:35.120]   And I'm so thankful for them because even now, as I look and think about my walk with
[00:16:35.120 --> 00:16:42.120]   God, I have visible examples of people, "I wish I could pray like that person prayed."
[00:16:42.120 --> 00:16:44.840]   You know, "I wish I could be an evangelist like that guy."
[00:16:44.840 --> 00:16:45.840]   I remember him.
[00:16:45.840 --> 00:16:49.080]   You know, we used to be in a small group and we would share about how he would go to the
[00:16:49.080 --> 00:16:53.640]   coin laundry at night after work and he would stay there hoping that he would run into a
[00:16:53.640 --> 00:16:55.880]   non-Christian to share the gospel.
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.440]   You know, and I actually knew a guy who fasted 30 days, once a year, you know.
[00:17:02.440 --> 00:17:10.320]   And so God allowed me to be in the presence of these godly men and women who I can think
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:12.240]   about as, "That's the kind of person I want to be.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:14.560]   That's what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ."
[00:17:14.560 --> 00:17:19.200]   And I'm trying very hard to follow in their footsteps.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:24.760]   Everything that we do leaves an imprint, good or bad.
[00:17:24.760 --> 00:17:27.080]   Our children are going to follow those steps.
[00:17:27.080 --> 00:17:31.140]   The people that you are influencing, the younger ones, the next generation, are following those
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.140]   steps.
[00:17:32.140 --> 00:17:36.440]   And I pray with all my heart that we can say the same thing that Paul is saying.
[00:17:36.440 --> 00:17:42.300]   To imitate me in my teaching, in my conduct, in my aim of life.
[00:17:42.300 --> 00:17:46.080]   With Paul, his aim was pretty clear.
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:53.120]   In Acts 20.24, as he was rounding out his second or third missionary journey and people
[00:17:53.120 --> 00:17:57.080]   were telling him, prophets were coming and telling him, "Don't go to Jerusalem because
[00:17:57.080 --> 00:17:59.000]   if you go, you're going to be bound.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:01.280]   You're going to be put into prison."
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.980]   And so they were pleading with him, crying, hoping that he would turn his path.
[00:18:06.980 --> 00:18:13.380]   But Paul says in Acts 20.24 to the elders of Ephesus, "I do not count my life of any
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.220]   value nor as precious to myself.
[00:18:16.220 --> 00:18:21.200]   If only I may finish my course in the ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus to testify
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:24.580]   to the gospel of the grace of God."
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:28.940]   Now again, you know, we can't say this is Paul's life verse because this is, Paul said
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:29.940]   it.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:32.820]   This is supposed to be our life verse, but I'm pretty sure this pretty much sums up his
[00:18:32.820 --> 00:18:33.820]   life.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:38.820]   That he's already, when he met Christ, when Christ called him to the gospel ministry,
[00:18:38.820 --> 00:18:39.820]   he already died.
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:40.820]   He's dead.
[00:18:40.820 --> 00:18:43.620]   It's no longer about him.
[00:18:43.620 --> 00:18:47.380]   Now the life I now live, I live by the faith of the Son of God who loved me and gave himself
[00:18:47.380 --> 00:18:48.420]   for me.
[00:18:48.420 --> 00:18:50.900]   My life is now hidden with Christ.
[00:18:50.900 --> 00:18:54.760]   And I, when he comes in his glory, we will also be glorified with him.
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.920]   So Paul was crucified at his baptism.
[00:18:59.920 --> 00:19:04.640]   And so what he's saying here is basically what he's living out.
[00:19:04.640 --> 00:19:05.640]   This is how he's living.
[00:19:05.640 --> 00:19:11.640]   So if I go to Jerusalem and preach in the gospel and if I die, so be it.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:12.640]   This is my calling.
[00:19:12.640 --> 00:19:16.600]   When Paul said, "Here am I, send me," he meant it.
[00:19:16.600 --> 00:19:19.400]   You know, I wrestle with that.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.960]   People just assume, "Oh, you're a pastor.
[00:19:20.960 --> 00:19:23.160]   You've already committed your life to a full-time ministry."
[00:19:23.160 --> 00:19:26.960]   But yes, I did.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.200]   I did many years ago.
[00:19:29.200 --> 00:19:33.720]   But I realized that this is something that keeps creeping back in over and over.
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:36.360]   And I'm very comfortable at our church.
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:37.360]   Very comfortable.
[00:19:37.360 --> 00:19:41.440]   There was a period in our church, the first maybe about six, seven years, where every
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:47.000]   week I came home discouraged and thinking, "Do I want to keep doing this?
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.600]   How long am I going to be able to do this?"
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:50.360]   And struggling with that.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:54.960]   But the last seven, eight, nine years, it's been comfortable.
[00:19:54.960 --> 00:19:56.640]   You know, we have a nice church facility.
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:19:59.400]   We have a church filled with people that I care about.
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.280]   Hopefully you care about me too.
[00:20:01.280 --> 00:20:02.280]   Hopefully.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.480]   Knock on wood.
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.480]   Right?
[00:20:05.480 --> 00:20:10.240]   As we have a lot of college students coming in, coming in from all over.
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:14.400]   We have a lot of foreign students coming in town that we have an opportunity to share
[00:20:14.400 --> 00:20:15.400]   the gospel.
[00:20:15.400 --> 00:20:16.920]   We have a church plant up north.
[00:20:16.920 --> 00:20:21.400]   We have men and women who are willing to pack up their bags and go out to China and plant
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:22.400]   churches.
[00:20:22.400 --> 00:20:26.080]   And so this is a great church in my view.
[00:20:26.080 --> 00:20:27.640]   I love this church.
[00:20:27.640 --> 00:20:28.640]   The bills are paid.
[00:20:28.640 --> 00:20:32.160]   Our children are taken care of.
[00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:34.640]   And so it's not very hard to be here.
[00:20:34.640 --> 00:20:39.600]   In fact, most of my pastor friends look at our church and they're envious of me.
[00:20:39.600 --> 00:20:42.700]   You know, I wish I was in that situation.
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:46.800]   So I'm thankful for what we have.
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:49.920]   But at the same time, this is a struggle.
[00:20:49.920 --> 00:20:55.520]   Because I have to ask myself, when Paul says, "I do not account my life of any value, nor
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:57.240]   is it precious to myself.
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:01.520]   If only I may finish my course and ministry that I received from the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.320]   Is that my honest confession?
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   Is that my confession?
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:13.480]   Or am I laboring and working so hard to protect what we have?
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:19.400]   Are you making decisions, being concerned that where we've come, that somehow God's
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:23.120]   not going to shake this up and go back to where we were?
[00:21:23.120 --> 00:21:25.120]   Now, I don't know.
[00:21:25.120 --> 00:21:26.120]   Don't worry.
[00:21:26.120 --> 00:21:27.120]   I don't have any crazy thoughts.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:30.880]   This is just me just wrestling.
[00:21:30.880 --> 00:21:33.840]   Is that my aim in life?
[00:21:33.840 --> 00:21:37.840]   I look at what's happening all over the world, and in particular because I just came back
[00:21:37.840 --> 00:21:39.680]   from Philippines.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:46.160]   And a question that I am convicted with, whether I'm in China, whether I'm in India, whether
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:50.480]   I'm in Philippines or anywhere else in the world, the question that I come back with,
[00:21:50.480 --> 00:21:52.640]   "What are you going to do?"
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:55.200]   Yes, you saw this.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:56.720]   Yes, you heard this.
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:58.320]   And you experienced this.
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.740]   Now what are you going to do?
[00:22:01.740 --> 00:22:04.960]   My honest answer to you is, "I don't know.
[00:22:04.960 --> 00:22:07.860]   I don't know."
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:12.960]   But there's a stirring in my heart, whether you want to call that just my emotions or
[00:22:12.960 --> 00:22:20.640]   Holy Spirit conviction, there's a stirring in my heart that we're not there.
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:23.240]   That God has tremendously blessed us.
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:24.920]   You guys have money.
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.120]   You guys have freedom.
[00:22:26.120 --> 00:22:27.120]   You guys have health.
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:32.360]   You have everything that 99% of the world wishes that they had.
[00:22:32.360 --> 00:22:35.140]   You and I have already.
[00:22:35.140 --> 00:22:38.560]   So the next question is, "What are you going to do?"
[00:22:38.560 --> 00:22:41.500]   Again, "I don't know."
[00:22:41.500 --> 00:22:42.680]   And I'm going to be wrestling with this.
[00:22:42.680 --> 00:22:44.800]   I'm going to continue to wrestle with this.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:48.040]   I want you to wrestle with me with this.
[00:22:48.040 --> 00:22:50.640]   What are we going to do with this?
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.480]   What are we going to do with this blessing?
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:57.680]   What imprint, what footprints are we going to leave behind for our children and for our
[00:22:57.680 --> 00:23:00.200]   next generation?
[00:23:00.200 --> 00:23:04.860]   Are we going to simply say, "I saved up this money and I give it to you as an inheritance.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:06.680]   Look at this nice house.
[00:23:06.680 --> 00:23:09.920]   If I pass, I'm going to give that to you."
[00:23:09.920 --> 00:23:16.700]   Are we going to leave behind imprints so that they can work for eternal things?
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:21.440]   They can labor in value and be broken for the lost.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.440]   And so I wrestle with that.
[00:23:22.440 --> 00:23:26.220]   And Paul says to Timothy, "Timothy, you're not on the wrong path.
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:28.500]   Yes, hardship is coming.
[00:23:28.500 --> 00:23:30.180]   Yes, persecution is.
[00:23:30.180 --> 00:23:31.180]   Yes, I may die.
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:34.300]   But Timothy, you're not on the wrong path.
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:36.300]   You're not like those people.
[00:23:36.300 --> 00:23:38.480]   Even if you die, you shall live."
[00:23:38.480 --> 00:23:43.620]   And so he says, again, "Follow my teaching, my conduct, my aim in life."
[00:23:43.620 --> 00:23:47.320]   And then the part where we left off when it says, "My faith."
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.900]   The faith that he's talking about is not talking about creed.
[00:23:49.900 --> 00:23:51.420]   It's not talking about doctrine.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.060]   But the outworking of our confession.
[00:23:55.060 --> 00:23:58.780]   Faithfulness, maybe that's a better way to put it.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.300]   Faith is observable.
[00:24:02.300 --> 00:24:05.060]   Despite what we hear in our generation, faith is something you feel.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:06.060]   It's deep inside.
[00:24:06.060 --> 00:24:10.100]   And no one judge you because it's something in here you can't see.
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.820]   Faith is tangible.
[00:24:12.820 --> 00:24:19.360]   Because logically, everything you do, you do because you believe something.
[00:24:19.360 --> 00:24:22.780]   Somebody tells me, if I watch the news and they say it's going to rain today, and if
[00:24:22.780 --> 00:24:27.780]   I believe what they tell me, I would grab a raincoat or an umbrella.
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:30.380]   And say, "Well, it may not rain, so I don't believe."
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.980]   If I don't believe what they're saying, I'm not going to grab it.
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:33.980]   Right?
[00:24:33.980 --> 00:24:35.580]   Every day, you and I live by it.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:40.220]   Every time you get in your car and you drive by a light and it's green.
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:43.620]   And every time you go through that intersection, you're living by faith.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:46.700]   You believe that because it's green, you're safe.
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:49.300]   And that other one is red, so it's going to stop the other car.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.540]   Imagine if you didn't believe that.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:55.140]   If you were going through an intersection, going 50 miles per hour, and another car is
[00:24:55.140 --> 00:24:59.140]   coming 50 miles per hour, and you didn't believe that that car was going to stop, would you
[00:24:59.140 --> 00:25:00.140]   go through the intersection?
[00:25:00.140 --> 00:25:02.020]   No, you would not.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:04.180]   Because the consequence is you're going to get in an accident.
[00:25:04.180 --> 00:25:08.020]   That car coming 50 miles per hour, you going 50 miles per hour, you have a collision, you're
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:09.100]   going to die.
[00:25:09.100 --> 00:25:11.300]   So the consequence is too great.
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:15.500]   If you don't believe it, you're not going to go through that intersection.
[00:25:15.500 --> 00:25:21.900]   Every day, every decision that we make is an out-product of what we believe.
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:23.780]   Because I believe it, this is what I do.
[00:25:23.780 --> 00:25:25.500]   I believe that I'm going to be safe.
[00:25:25.500 --> 00:25:27.180]   Now, it's not 100%.
[00:25:27.180 --> 00:25:32.100]   Obviously, there are times when people cross red light and tragedy happens.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:37.500]   But every day, I'm living because I believe in something.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:42.980]   So when it comes to our faith in Christ, it is only logical that our faith in Christ would
[00:25:42.980 --> 00:25:46.620]   have tangible evidence in the way that we live.
[00:25:46.620 --> 00:25:51.940]   Paul sends Timothy back to the Thessalonians because he's afraid that these false prophets
[00:25:51.940 --> 00:25:53.940]   are going to come in and destroy their faith.
[00:25:53.940 --> 00:26:00.060]   Timothy comes back to Paul and he says, "Not only did they not fault, but they're thriving
[00:26:00.060 --> 00:26:01.060]   in their faith."
[00:26:01.060 --> 00:26:06.180]   Timothy comes back to Paul and he reports it, "For not only has the word of the Lord
[00:26:06.180 --> 00:26:11.940]   sounded forth from you in Macedonia and Achaia, but your faith in God has gone forth everywhere
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.660]   so that we need not say anything."
[00:26:14.660 --> 00:26:17.420]   What does it mean that their faith went out?
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:18.940]   What does that mean?
[00:26:18.940 --> 00:26:23.700]   If faith is intangible, it's just deeply inside here, and this is how I feel, what does it
[00:26:23.700 --> 00:26:26.020]   mean for it to go out?
[00:26:26.020 --> 00:26:30.820]   See, Timothy went to Thessalonica and he observed their life.
[00:26:30.820 --> 00:26:33.900]   He saw the out-product of what they believed.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:39.540]   And so, when Timothy says that their faith is going out, he's talking about the response
[00:26:39.540 --> 00:26:42.900]   that they had to the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:44.980]   So faith is tangible.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:51.900]   If you believe that Jesus Christ is the only answer to the greatest problem of this world.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:56.340]   If you look at something like that, if you look at these young children being taken advantage
[00:26:56.340 --> 00:27:00.900]   of because they don't have money by people who have money, and that doesn't somehow cause
[00:27:00.900 --> 00:27:03.820]   you to cringe, something has gone wrong in our heart.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:08.180]   I think you don't have to be a Christian to feel compassion for them.
[00:27:08.180 --> 00:27:12.580]   When you see a mother and children who may die simply because they don't have enough
[00:27:12.580 --> 00:27:20.180]   medicine for a simple fix for us, and we're not moved at all, there's something deeply
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.500]   wrong with our humanity.
[00:27:21.500 --> 00:27:26.820]   I don't know if I'm Christian or not Christian.
[00:27:26.820 --> 00:27:30.380]   But if we believe something and it has absolutely no effect in our lives other than the fact
[00:27:30.380 --> 00:27:36.220]   that we come to church, can that be genuine faith?
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:44.220]   You know, Paul says, not Paul, but John says in 1 John 1, 9, and again, this is a verse
[00:27:44.220 --> 00:27:48.500]   that probably many of you have memorized, have repeated over and over, and I've repeated
[00:27:48.500 --> 00:27:50.400]   over and over.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:54.380]   But this is a verse that if you, at the surface, doesn't make any sense.
[00:27:54.380 --> 00:28:00.080]   And that's 1 John 1, 9, it says, "If we confess our sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:03.420]   us our sins and to cleanse us from all unrighteousness."
[00:28:03.420 --> 00:28:07.220]   How many of you have memorized this verse?
[00:28:07.220 --> 00:28:09.500]   And how many of you refuse to raise your hand?
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:10.500]   All right.
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:14.180]   I know a lot more of you have memorized this verse.
[00:28:14.180 --> 00:28:19.660]   But if you really think about it, if you confess your sins, He is faithful and He is just to
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:21.020]   forgive you of your sins.
[00:28:21.020 --> 00:28:23.040]   Does that make any sense?
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   If you came into the court of law and you come and say, "I confess, I did it, I'm guilty."
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:33.880]   If that judge is faithful and just, He will convict him.
[00:28:33.880 --> 00:28:39.660]   If you are the lawbreaker and you just confessed it, and you saved us all this time and money
[00:28:39.660 --> 00:28:42.760]   and energy, and you confessed it, done.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:43.860]   This is what the law says.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:47.580]   It requires that you get a minimum sentence of 5 years, 10 years, depending on what you
[00:28:47.580 --> 00:28:48.580]   did.
[00:28:48.580 --> 00:28:53.340]   But we would never say, "That judge is faithful and just, and so he forgave him and he pardoned
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:54.340]   him."
[00:28:54.340 --> 00:28:57.380]   That's what that verse says.
[00:28:57.380 --> 00:28:59.860]   So how does this verse make any sense?
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:06.880]   Why does His faithfulness and His justice lead to our forgiveness?
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:09.600]   Sometimes we read these verses and we don't really put much thought into it because we
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:12.260]   assume we know what it's talking about.
[00:29:12.260 --> 00:29:14.660]   But what is He talking about?
[00:29:14.660 --> 00:29:23.060]   That verse would only make sense if His faithfulness and justice is referring to something else.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:24.980]   What is He referring to?
[00:29:24.980 --> 00:29:27.420]   He's referring to His promise.
[00:29:27.420 --> 00:29:30.020]   It's referring to His nature.
[00:29:30.020 --> 00:29:34.620]   That because God does not delight in punishing the wicked.
[00:29:34.620 --> 00:29:39.660]   Because He has promised that one day, that through His Son, that all our sins are going
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.420]   to be washed away and that He would never remember it anymore.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:50.420]   And because He allowed His Son to be crucified and absorb your sins and my sins, past, present,
[00:29:50.420 --> 00:29:56.340]   and future, that it is only faithful for Him because He said He would do it.
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:30:02.740]   And the just thing for Him to do is to not punish us twice because His Son took the punishment
[00:30:02.740 --> 00:30:04.620]   for us.
[00:30:04.620 --> 00:30:09.940]   And that's why when that verse says, "If we confess our sins, He is faithful to what He
[00:30:09.940 --> 00:30:11.500]   has said."
[00:30:11.500 --> 00:30:16.220]   And He is just because He's already done it unto His Son.
[00:30:16.220 --> 00:30:19.740]   That He will cleanse us from all our unrighteousness.
[00:30:19.740 --> 00:30:22.700]   That's what the word means when He says He is faithful.
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.020]   To be consistent.
[00:30:25.020 --> 00:30:27.420]   And is it any different for us?
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.860]   For us to confess that we have been forgiven.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:35.820]   For us to confess that Jesus Christ is the only way.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:40.660]   And then to not have the evidence of that in our life?
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:42.980]   It is illogical.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:44.100]   It doesn't make any sense.
[00:30:44.100 --> 00:30:52.500]   It's inconsistent to confess and not have the byproduct of our confession to be true.
[00:30:52.500 --> 00:30:56.500]   That's why Paul said in Philippians 4, 12, 13, "I know how to be brought low and I know
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:58.300]   how to be abound.
[00:30:58.300 --> 00:31:02.600]   In any and every circumstance, I have learned the secret of facing plenty and hunger, abundance
[00:31:02.600 --> 00:31:03.600]   and need.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:05.700]   I can do all things through Him who strengthens me."
[00:31:05.700 --> 00:31:07.700]   Well, how did Paul come to know this?
[00:31:07.700 --> 00:31:09.580]   He didn't come there and he just meditated on it.
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:13.180]   It's like all of a sudden, you know, all of a sudden, "Oh, now I got it.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:14.180]   Now I get it."
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:17.580]   He was some greater enlightenment that he didn't have before.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:23.580]   When he says, "I have learned how to be brought low," how did he learn it?
[00:31:23.580 --> 00:31:26.220]   Because God brought him low.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:28.060]   Because he couldn't pay his bills.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:31.380]   He's an apostle of God and sometimes he had to make tents.
[00:31:31.380 --> 00:31:33.600]   And sometimes he had to go hungry.
[00:31:33.600 --> 00:31:35.220]   And sometimes he had to be beaten.
[00:31:35.220 --> 00:31:37.000]   Sometimes he was chained in prison.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.060]   And in those circumstances, he learned how to be brought low.
[00:31:40.060 --> 00:31:42.320]   He knew how to cling to Christ.
[00:31:42.320 --> 00:31:44.800]   And his faith sustained him.
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.180]   He knew even when he was plenty, when people were giving him money and giving him honor,
[00:31:49.180 --> 00:31:52.140]   he knows not to cling to that.
[00:31:52.140 --> 00:31:53.680]   That that's not his treasure.
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:31:58.500]   That even in abundance, even in honor, that ultimately his treasure is Christ.
[00:31:58.500 --> 00:31:59.500]   And that's what he means.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.540]   He didn't just learn this sitting in meditation because he heard some teaching.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:05.220]   He said he was faithful.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:10.300]   His faith in Christ carried him through these things and kept him centered on Christ.
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:12.480]   See, that's what he means.
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:17.800]   He said, "Follow me in my example, in my faith, in my perseverance."
[00:32:17.800 --> 00:32:21.100]   Next thing he says, "In patience, macrothermia."
[00:32:21.100 --> 00:32:24.100]   Let me read you exactly what it says in the Bible dictionary.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:28.680]   Macrothermia, which is translated "patience" in some of your Bible's long-suffering,
[00:32:28.680 --> 00:32:35.380]   it says, "The quality of a person who is able to avenge himself and yet refrains from doing so."
[00:32:35.380 --> 00:32:37.240]   Let me read it again.
[00:32:37.240 --> 00:32:43.360]   "The quality of a person who is able to avenge himself and yet refrains from doing so."
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:47.520]   It's talking specifically about being slandered.
[00:32:47.520 --> 00:32:50.260]   About somebody who wrongs you.
[00:32:50.260 --> 00:32:56.480]   Because our natural reaction when somebody slanders us is to, like, "Wow, that was unfair."
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:58.000]   You know, we want justice.
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.180]   If they slammed us, somebody needs to expose that.
[00:33:00.180 --> 00:33:03.460]   We can't possibly let them get away with that.
[00:33:03.460 --> 00:33:05.760]   And so we slander.
[00:33:05.760 --> 00:33:07.900]   So we talk about them.
[00:33:07.900 --> 00:33:14.240]   He's not talking about patience as in, you know, refraining yourself from slashing their tires.
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:15.740]   He's saying, "You have the ability to do that.
[00:33:15.740 --> 00:33:16.740]   You can easily do that.
[00:33:16.740 --> 00:33:21.180]   I can open my mouth and say all of these things."
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:23.440]   You have the ability, but you don't.
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:25.500]   Why is Paul saying that?
[00:33:25.500 --> 00:33:29.220]   Because he was constantly under pressure.
[00:33:29.220 --> 00:33:32.060]   From the very church that he sacrificed.
[00:33:32.060 --> 00:33:33.260]   From Corinthians.
[00:33:33.260 --> 00:33:34.900]   From the Galatians.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   From the church of Ephesus.
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:38.940]   The people that he loved.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.260]   People were questioning this guy.
[00:33:40.260 --> 00:33:46.160]   You know, the best way to undermine somebody's teaching is to nullify the guy.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:48.660]   And that's what he was afraid of when he went to Thessalonica.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:52.760]   These false teachers came in and said, "All that guy, he wants money.
[00:33:52.760 --> 00:33:56.300]   He's like any other false prophet that comes in, and he's trying to take advantage of you.
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:33:58.540]   In the end, all he wants is honor and money."
[00:33:58.540 --> 00:34:02.000]   And that's why when he writes 1 and 2 Thessalonians, he defends himself.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:03.800]   You know how we behave.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:05.300]   How we didn't take your money.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:09.740]   We set an example for you to work hard with your hands.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:12.960]   Paul was constantly under pressure.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:17.580]   But despite that, Paul says, remember at the end of chapter 2, Paul tells Timothy, "Who
[00:34:17.580 --> 00:34:19.460]   knows, be gentle with them.
[00:34:19.460 --> 00:34:22.420]   They may come to Christ as well."
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:23.620]   So that's what Paul is telling you.
[00:34:23.620 --> 00:34:26.860]   He said, "Here's this pressure, and people are questioning you."
[00:34:26.860 --> 00:34:32.140]   And he says, "Don't worry about them, because that's what Christ did for us."
[00:34:32.140 --> 00:34:38.940]   See, the cross does not point us to fairness.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:39.940]   Every single one of us.
[00:34:39.940 --> 00:34:41.660]   We're not asking for more.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:45.240]   We're just asking to be treated fairly.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:48.900]   If at work you worked hard, somebody else comes in and they get an advanced position,
[00:34:48.900 --> 00:34:49.900]   what do we say?
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:50.900]   "That's not fair."
[00:34:50.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   Right?
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:53.520]   "That's not fair."
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:56.620]   If you're going on the highway and you're going 75 miles per hour, and the next guy's
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:35:00.660]   going 80, but you're the one who gets pulled over, even though you both broke the law,
[00:35:00.660 --> 00:35:03.060]   you say, "That guy went… he's worse than I am."
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.580]   That's not fair.
[00:35:04.580 --> 00:35:09.260]   Something inside of us is always crying out, "Fairness, fairness."
[00:35:09.260 --> 00:35:14.260]   But when we look at the cross, the cross does not yell out, "Fairness."
[00:35:14.260 --> 00:35:20.420]   The greatest injustice, according to your definition and my definition, happened at
[00:35:20.420 --> 00:35:21.420]   the cross.
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:27.360]   Because the only person that was absolutely innocent was Jesus.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:34.420]   And all of sin, your sins, my sins, have been placed, and He absorbed that all upon Himself.
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.180]   The cross does not shout out, "Fairness."
[00:35:37.180 --> 00:35:40.860]   It cries out, "Mercy and grace."
[00:35:40.860 --> 00:35:51.540]   So there is no one who is affected by the cross who can yell out, "Fairness."
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:56.000]   You and I would not be here if it was fairness that we received.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:01.100]   You and I would not be here to be able to understand His Word if God treated us justly
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:03.200]   according to His law.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:04.980]   He was merciful to us.
[00:36:04.980 --> 00:36:11.620]   And He had every power and every right to condemn us, and yet He demonstrated His own
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:14.380]   love toward us, and while we were yet sinners, He died for us.
[00:36:14.380 --> 00:36:18.060]   And that's why He says, "To follow my faith as I follow Christ.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:19.620]   Follow my patience."
[00:36:19.620 --> 00:36:21.140]   Macrothermia.
[00:36:21.140 --> 00:36:24.020]   As He practiced macrothermia on us.
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:27.320]   And then He says, "To follow my love."
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:32.200]   And again, you know, if you don't know the importance of love in the church, you haven't
[00:36:32.200 --> 00:36:33.200]   been here.
[00:36:33.200 --> 00:36:34.200]   You haven't read your Word.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:39.520]   Because love is the first of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in Galatians chapter
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:40.520]   6.
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.960]   Of the three virtues, love, faith, and hope, the greatest is love.
[00:36:43.960 --> 00:36:47.280]   Imagine faith is what we're saved by.
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.480]   By faith and faith alone.
[00:36:48.480 --> 00:36:51.160]   Hope is what causes us to persevere.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:56.080]   And as great as these things are, He said, without love, it means nothing.
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:36:58.200]   It means nothing.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:37:03.840]   If our laboring in the Gospels, if our laboring in the Word of God, and study of theology,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:08.080]   and spreading of the Gospel, and doing mission work, and helping the poor, if that doesn't
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:12.400]   ultimately lead us to a greater love for God, and greater love for His people, He says,
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:13.400]   it means nothing.
[00:37:13.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   You've missed the whole point.
[00:37:15.400 --> 00:37:24.720]   And that's why Paul says, and reminds Timothy, he says that the aim of this command is love.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:25.720]   That's our aim.
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:26.720]   That's our ultimate goal.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:28.880]   Why are we gathered here together this morning to worship?
[00:37:28.880 --> 00:37:31.440]   It's not simply, "Oh, okay, I know why Timothy wrote this letter."
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:35.320]   You know, and then leave at the end of today and say, "Oh, okay, I know what it is.
[00:37:35.320 --> 00:37:36.320]   I know what Paul means."
[00:37:36.320 --> 00:37:37.320]   So follow his steps.
[00:37:37.320 --> 00:37:38.920]   And you can miss the whole point.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.720]   You can know everything about the Bible and miss the whole point if our goal is not to
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:43.720]   love.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:45.440]   If our application isn't love.
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:49.640]   If every text doesn't lead us to loving God and loving others, you've missed the whole
[00:37:49.640 --> 00:37:52.040]   point.
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.980]   Love is what God desires from us.
[00:37:55.980 --> 00:37:59.600]   And then he says, "My steadfastness in perseverance."
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:04.720]   And this is, again, it sounds the same as the word patience, but it actually has a different
[00:38:04.720 --> 00:38:05.720]   nuance to it.
[00:38:05.720 --> 00:38:06.720]   Huppamone.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.000]   Again, I'm going to read you exactly what it says in the Bible dictionary.
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:15.400]   The word translated for steadfastness, it says, "is associated with hope and refers
[00:38:15.400 --> 00:38:19.800]   to that quality of character which does not allow one to surrender to circumstances or
[00:38:19.800 --> 00:38:22.280]   succumb under trial."
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:23.600]   And then here's the second part.
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:30.240]   "This is in direct contrast to macrothermia, long-suffering, or endurance toward people."
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:33.800]   So the first word, patience, is about people.
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:37.660]   How people are treating you and people slandering you and how you react toward that.
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:41.180]   But the second word is about circumstance.
[00:38:41.180 --> 00:38:44.580]   It may not have happened because somebody else did it to you, but God allows you to
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:47.040]   experience various trials.
[00:38:47.040 --> 00:38:52.580]   And in those trials, recognizing and trusting that our God is a sovereign God.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:54.900]   Yes, trials are coming.
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:56.660]   Persecution has intensified.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:38:59.340]   The apostles are being rounded up.
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:01.400]   Some of them are being killed.
[00:39:01.400 --> 00:39:04.200]   And you guys are next.
[00:39:04.200 --> 00:39:08.740]   But in that context, he tells him to persevere.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:16.440]   Persevering isn't telling Timothy to now, you know, we've done great using this technique,
[00:39:16.440 --> 00:39:20.360]   but now this is leading us to prison.
[00:39:20.360 --> 00:39:22.620]   Maybe we should switch it up.
[00:39:22.620 --> 00:39:27.920]   And again, we have a tendency to think that only if we train people a certain way, or
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:31.560]   if we had a program, and if we did, you know, step one to step two, if we had a two-year
[00:39:31.560 --> 00:39:34.800]   program of this and three-year program of that, maybe we need to go.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:42.320]   So we have people studying, writing dissertations, PhD papers all over the world trying to figure
[00:39:42.320 --> 00:39:46.220]   out maybe this generation needs something different.
[00:39:46.220 --> 00:39:53.760]   So every day, PhD papers are being defended in seminaries trying to figure out how to
[00:39:53.760 --> 00:39:57.280]   do ministry differently in this new generation.
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:03.120]   But the warning and the encouragement that we constantly get is to continue.
[00:40:03.120 --> 00:40:04.120]   To continue.
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:08.720]   It's like, God didn't call us to be clever.
[00:40:08.720 --> 00:40:11.920]   God didn't call us to be smart.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:16.080]   God called us to obey.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:17.600]   We don't have to be a PhD.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:22.200]   We don't have to be the next scholar, or the smartest, or most articulate.
[00:40:22.200 --> 00:40:24.120]   He says, "Pay attention."
[00:40:24.120 --> 00:40:26.400]   That's why Jesus said when he was leaving them, what did he say?
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:27.400]   "What are we going to do?
[00:40:27.400 --> 00:40:29.160]   We've been following you.
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:30.640]   If you leave us, where do we go?"
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:32.840]   He said, "I'm going to send the Holy Spirit.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:34.640]   I'm not going to leave you as orphans.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:38.880]   When the Holy Spirit comes, he's going to remind you of what I said, so you don't forget.
[00:40:38.880 --> 00:40:41.160]   He's not going to teach you new things.
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:42.840]   He didn't say the Holy Spirit was going to come.
[00:40:42.840 --> 00:40:46.440]   He's going to take you to the next level, and everything that I forgot to teach you,
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:47.440]   he's going to teach you."
[00:40:47.440 --> 00:40:48.440]   He didn't say that.
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:52.600]   He's going to come, and he's going to remind you of everything that I said.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:56.160]   And he's going to be the one who convicts the world of sin.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:57.160]   And you stick to him.
[00:40:57.160 --> 00:40:59.200]   That's why he says, "Remain in him.
[00:40:59.200 --> 00:41:02.000]   I am the true vine.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.320]   No one can bear fruit if he doesn't abide in me."
[00:41:04.320 --> 00:41:05.320]   So what does he say?
[00:41:05.320 --> 00:41:07.240]   "You've been following me up to this point.
[00:41:07.240 --> 00:41:08.920]   Keep following me.
[00:41:08.920 --> 00:41:11.320]   Keep following me."
[00:41:11.320 --> 00:41:16.040]   Didn't the Scripture say in 1 Peter, "Everything that you need for a life of godliness, you
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:19.880]   have been given in the knowledge of his Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:21.000]   Everything.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   That's not just me and you sitting here.
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:26.640]   That's also to the North Koreans who don't have a church building, who don't have the
[00:41:26.640 --> 00:41:28.000]   translation of the Bible.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.400]   He says, "Everything has been given to you."
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.560]   Yes, it's great to have small groups.
[00:41:32.560 --> 00:41:38.080]   Yes, it's great to have different things and different translations.
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:42.600]   But we keep missing the point when we keep thinking like, "Oh, we need something different.
[00:41:42.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   It's not working.
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:45.160]   This isn't working, so let's try this."
[00:41:45.160 --> 00:41:50.280]   When all he kept on telling us is to keep continuing.
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.680]   Keep abiding.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:57.680]   You know, it doesn't sound smart.
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:42:04.880]   It almost sounds lazy to say, "Just abide in Christ."
[00:42:04.880 --> 00:42:06.720]   It sounds like, "Oh, okay.
[00:42:06.720 --> 00:42:08.500]   Anybody can say that.
[00:42:08.500 --> 00:42:09.500]   Anybody can say that."
[00:42:09.500 --> 00:42:12.080]   And you're exactly right.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.880]   And that's why he calls anybody.
[00:42:14.880 --> 00:42:17.280]   That's why he called anybody.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.200]   Fishermen.
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.200]   That's why he called the uneducated.
[00:42:21.200 --> 00:42:23.480]   The people who had no honor.
[00:42:23.480 --> 00:42:24.480]   People who had nothing.
[00:42:24.480 --> 00:42:25.480]   He called everybody.
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:30.440]   You know, we have a tendency to think that if I don't go to seminary, I can't teach.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.880]   If I didn't get gospel training, I can't share the gospel.
[00:42:33.880 --> 00:42:37.240]   If I didn't receive small group training, I can't lead small group.
[00:42:37.240 --> 00:42:41.520]   I didn't get missionary training, so I can't go to missions.
[00:42:41.520 --> 00:42:44.600]   Where did that come from?
[00:42:44.600 --> 00:42:46.440]   Was that taught in the scripture?
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.480]   Is that what he told his disciples?
[00:42:48.480 --> 00:42:49.840]   "Wait.
[00:42:49.840 --> 00:42:55.240]   Wait before you go, because I have level 2 training of discipleship that I didn't finish.
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.520]   I only got to 1.
[00:42:56.520 --> 00:43:00.480]   So when you finish level 2, and then when you're done with that, you go to level 3,
[00:43:00.480 --> 00:43:01.800]   and then maybe about 5, 6 years.
[00:43:01.800 --> 00:43:06.280]   And then when we establish the seminary, and then we have educated people who can educate
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   you, and then after about 12, 13 years of training, now you can go and share the gospel."
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   Did he say that?
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:16.200]   Where is that in the scripture?
[00:43:16.200 --> 00:43:17.200]   You made that.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:18.200]   I made that.
[00:43:18.200 --> 00:43:19.680]   The church generation has made that.
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:21.040]   The church made that.
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:22.880]   That is not in the scripture.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.120]   He is telling Timothy, what does he say?
[00:43:25.120 --> 00:43:28.880]   These people are going to go from worse, bad to worse, but what does he say in verse 14?
[00:43:28.880 --> 00:43:31.640]   "But for you, continue in what you have learned."
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.560]   Continue.
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.040]   What you know about Jesus, continue.
[00:43:38.040 --> 00:43:43.160]   Why do you think the Bible says in Revelation, "You have forsaken your first love to restore."
[00:43:43.160 --> 00:43:44.760]   How do you restore that?
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:46.720]   Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:47.720]   Remember.
[00:43:47.720 --> 00:43:56.360]   He didn't say, "Go out and look for new groups, new techniques, new strategies, cutting edge."
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:44:02.040]   He said, "No, go back to what gave you power in the first place."
[00:44:02.040 --> 00:44:08.160]   When you met Christ, did somebody argue you into the kingdom?
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:12.520]   Did somebody present to you all the logical reasons why you should meet Christ, and you
[00:44:12.520 --> 00:44:17.240]   said, "I have no answer for this, and therefore you change your life and follow Christ."
[00:44:17.240 --> 00:44:20.680]   No, you encounter the power of the cross.
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:25.240]   What may have been foolishness to you at one point, but it was the power of God.
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:28.580]   And you change your life.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.900]   You didn't do it.
[00:44:29.900 --> 00:44:33.000]   You encountered God's power.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.960]   And he says, "That power that you've encountered, don't stray from it.
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:40.000]   What you have learned, continue in it.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:42.680]   Continue to cling to Him.
[00:44:42.680 --> 00:44:44.800]   Continue to follow in His steps."
[00:44:44.800 --> 00:44:46.360]   And that's why he says, "To persevere."
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:51.760]   And he says, "Even in persecution, even in my suffering, follow me in this path, because
[00:44:51.760 --> 00:44:55.480]   the path that you are on is going to lead you to this."
[00:44:55.480 --> 00:44:57.720]   In Antioch, in Iconium, and in Lystra.
[00:44:57.720 --> 00:45:01.080]   And he reminds Timothy, "Remember when you first followed me, I never promised you an
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:02.080]   easy life."
[00:45:02.080 --> 00:45:06.120]   Paul, as soon as he was called, remember what Jesus said about Paul?
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:09.160]   "I'm going to show him how much he must suffer for my name's sake."
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:13.120]   So from the day that he was called, he was called to suffer.
[00:45:13.120 --> 00:45:15.200]   But here's the catch.
[00:45:15.200 --> 00:45:17.480]   Timothy followed this man.
[00:45:17.480 --> 00:45:22.400]   This is a guy who was stoned, dragged out, walks right back in, in Lystra.
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.160]   That's where Timothy is from.
[00:45:24.160 --> 00:45:28.080]   His grandmother, his mother, came to Christ at that city.
[00:45:28.080 --> 00:45:32.400]   So imagine, persecution and the threat of death was real to them.
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:36.960]   So he's reminding Timothy, "Timothy, when you first followed me, that's who I was, and
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:37.960]   that's where I was headed.
[00:45:37.960 --> 00:45:39.420]   And you followed me faithfully.
[00:45:39.420 --> 00:45:45.220]   And now that it's getting intense, don't think that you made a mistake.
[00:45:45.220 --> 00:45:49.780]   In fact, not only did God call me to this, not only did God call you to this, what does
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:50.780]   he say?
[00:45:50.780 --> 00:45:55.660]   "All who desire to live godly lives will be persecuted."
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.820]   Now that word "all," is that only referring to the first century, referring to people
[00:46:00.820 --> 00:46:02.400]   at that time?
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:07.140]   Or does that "all" mean "all"?
[00:46:07.140 --> 00:46:08.140]   It means all.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.100]   There's nothing hidden in the Greek.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.380]   There's nothing hidden in the context.
[00:46:12.380 --> 00:46:19.660]   All means you, me, first century, second century, and to come.
[00:46:19.660 --> 00:46:20.660]   But here's the thing.
[00:46:20.660 --> 00:46:26.460]   All who wants to live a godly life will be persecuted.
[00:46:26.460 --> 00:46:29.980]   When we think of godliness, we think of not doing this.
[00:46:29.980 --> 00:46:31.340]   Not getting drunk.
[00:46:31.340 --> 00:46:32.340]   Not watching certain things.
[00:46:32.340 --> 00:46:33.860]   Not going certain places.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:36.620]   So we're living a godly life.
[00:46:36.620 --> 00:46:41.980]   When Paul talks about godliness, he's not simply talking about not doing certain things.
[00:46:41.980 --> 00:46:44.700]   There's a sin of commission, and there's a sin of omission.
[00:46:44.700 --> 00:46:46.660]   Things that we know we ought to do and not to do.
[00:46:46.660 --> 00:46:50.460]   That is also sin before God's eyes.
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.140]   Why were they persecuted?
[00:46:53.140 --> 00:46:57.820]   If they gathered together in their homes, and they had Bible study, and they had VBS,
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:02.580]   and they raised their children in their home, not bothering anybody, they wouldn't have
[00:47:02.580 --> 00:47:04.860]   been persecuted.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   For what reason?
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.180]   Because they have thousands of gods.
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:08.780]   You just happen to be one of them.
[00:47:08.780 --> 00:47:11.180]   And they have their temples, and you have your temple.
[00:47:11.180 --> 00:47:13.620]   They have their idols, you have their idols.
[00:47:13.620 --> 00:47:14.620]   And that's the thing.
[00:47:14.620 --> 00:47:19.540]   When you go to India, one of the hardest things about India is when you preach the gospel,
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:23.020]   when you share about Christ, they're very receptive initially.
[00:47:23.020 --> 00:47:26.620]   They say, "Yes, that's great."
[00:47:26.620 --> 00:47:30.340]   But after a while, you realize that they're not accepting Christ.
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:33.860]   They're just adding Jesus to the other idols that they have.
[00:47:33.860 --> 00:47:35.460]   And that's a freaky thing.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:40.500]   When you go to India, you'll see shrines, temples, and different idols, hideous stuff.
[00:47:40.500 --> 00:47:45.340]   And right in the middle of that, you see the Catholic cathedral, and you'll see the different
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.560]   statues of Mary and all the saints.
[00:47:47.560 --> 00:47:49.860]   And they're just right in the middle of it.
[00:47:49.860 --> 00:47:50.860]   Nobody's bothered by it.
[00:47:50.860 --> 00:47:54.340]   People come out of one and enter that one, and there's no difference.
[00:47:54.340 --> 00:47:58.580]   See, but that's not what the scripture talks about.
[00:47:58.580 --> 00:48:00.780]   Why did they get persecuted?
[00:48:00.780 --> 00:48:03.460]   Because they were proselytizing.
[00:48:03.460 --> 00:48:08.980]   Not only were they saying that Jesus Christ is somebody that they adore, they were beginning
[00:48:08.980 --> 00:48:14.180]   to tell other people, "In fact, this is the only way for you to live.
[00:48:14.180 --> 00:48:15.620]   There is no other God.
[00:48:15.620 --> 00:48:18.580]   All your other gods are not real gods.
[00:48:18.580 --> 00:48:19.580]   They're fake.
[00:48:19.580 --> 00:48:20.580]   They're man-made.
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:24.500]   In fact, for the very reason why you worship those idols," he said, "the judgment of God,
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:28.140]   the wrath of God is being revealed against all of these things."
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.500]   That's why they were being persecuted.
[00:48:30.500 --> 00:48:32.740]   Have you ever heard anybody say to you, "Oh, that's great.
[00:48:32.740 --> 00:48:34.740]   As long as you believe it.
[00:48:34.740 --> 00:48:40.100]   As long as you're not one of those Jesus freaks who try to shove religion down my throat.
[00:48:40.100 --> 00:48:42.500]   As long as you keep it to yourself.
[00:48:42.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   That's good.
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.500]   Good for you."
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:49.180]   We get persecuted not because we try to live a righteous life in our own homes, taking
[00:48:49.180 --> 00:48:53.100]   care of our children, and actively involved at church.
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:58.420]   Persecution comes as a result of pushing against the darkness.
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:01.540]   Because we're encroaching upon enemy territory.
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:06.260]   The battle is not inside of our home, protecting our kids so that they don't see bad things.
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:07.580]   That's part of our battle.
[00:49:07.580 --> 00:49:09.740]   But he said, "We are the light of the world."
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:12.140]   You don't light a lamp and put it under a desk.
[00:49:12.140 --> 00:49:17.120]   So you light a lamp and you put it on a desk so that the whole room can be lit.
[00:49:17.120 --> 00:49:22.020]   And when you light the room, people who have been accustomed to darkness doesn't want you
[00:49:22.020 --> 00:49:24.700]   to turn the light on.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.180]   They'll react.
[00:49:27.180 --> 00:49:30.420]   Just like if you've ever, when you're young, you know, you shared a room with your brother
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:33.780]   or sister, and it's time for you to go to school, and your brother doesn't want to go
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.420]   to school, and you flip the light on.
[00:49:36.420 --> 00:49:39.060]   Or maybe one of your roommates, right?
[00:49:39.060 --> 00:49:43.060]   You know, it's classes at 8 o'clock, and it's 8.15, they're not getting up, and you're concerned
[00:49:43.060 --> 00:49:48.180]   for them, and you, you know, open the curtain, bright light comes in, you flip the light
[00:49:48.180 --> 00:49:49.180]   on.
[00:49:49.180 --> 00:49:51.420]   When they open their eyes, what do they say?
[00:49:51.420 --> 00:49:52.420]   Thank you so much.
[00:49:52.420 --> 00:49:53.420]   Thank you.
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   They say that.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:55.420]   What are you doing?
[00:49:55.420 --> 00:49:56.420]   Right?
[00:49:56.420 --> 00:49:57.420]   I don't have class today, you dummy!
[00:49:57.420 --> 00:50:08.420]   Persecution comes as a result of advancing the Gospel.
[00:50:08.420 --> 00:50:13.900]   See, the way we avoid persecution is one, through isolation.
[00:50:13.900 --> 00:50:18.340]   If we isolate ourselves, and we don't contact the world, we're not with people that are
[00:50:18.340 --> 00:50:21.440]   uncomfortable, we're not with people that are going to question us, and cause us to
[00:50:21.440 --> 00:50:24.260]   question our faith, then we don't need to worry.
[00:50:24.260 --> 00:50:29.420]   Just raise my kids, good Sunday school, and go to church, and have fellowship, then yeah,
[00:50:29.420 --> 00:50:30.420]   what persecution?
[00:50:30.420 --> 00:50:32.820]   I don't experience any persecution.
[00:50:32.820 --> 00:50:35.220]   They wouldn't have been persecuted either.
[00:50:35.220 --> 00:50:39.060]   If they stayed home in their nice, comfortable room, raised their kids, and worshipped God,
[00:50:39.060 --> 00:50:43.820]   and had their, you know, grape juice and bread, and whatever they had, they wouldn't have
[00:50:43.820 --> 00:50:44.820]   been persecuted.
[00:50:44.820 --> 00:50:50.300]   They got persecuted because Paul recruited people, went from town to town to town to
[00:50:50.300 --> 00:50:51.300]   town.
[00:50:51.300 --> 00:50:56.380]   In fact, he was so effective, he was ruining their economy.
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.540]   And that's why they were angry with him.
[00:50:58.540 --> 00:50:59.980]   That's why they were stoning him.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:03.460]   He went into synagogues.
[00:51:03.460 --> 00:51:07.380]   I mean, he would get stoned in one synagogue, and leave, and go to the next city, and go
[00:51:07.380 --> 00:51:08.900]   to the next synagogue.
[00:51:08.900 --> 00:51:13.620]   At some point, you would think, "Maybe we should stop going to synagogues."
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.520]   But he didn't.
[00:51:15.520 --> 00:51:17.540]   Because that was the best place to start.
[00:51:17.540 --> 00:51:19.380]   Because they had the Old Testament.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:22.420]   And even if they reject me, that would be the best place to start.
[00:51:22.420 --> 00:51:25.220]   So he would first go to the synagogues and preach the Gospel.
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:29.940]   If he didn't go to the synagogues, there would have been less persecution.
[00:51:29.940 --> 00:51:33.820]   If he didn't go to the marketplaces, there would have been even less persecution.
[00:51:33.820 --> 00:51:41.980]   If he stayed at home, if he stayed in Antioch, and just built a nice, healthy church, we
[00:51:41.980 --> 00:51:49.880]   either live in isolation, or another way that we avoid persecution is assimilation.
[00:51:49.880 --> 00:51:55.620]   We live our lives and speak so much like the world, that they don't see any difference.
[00:51:55.620 --> 00:51:59.620]   It's like, "Well, you go to church, but I don't."
[00:51:59.620 --> 00:52:01.180]   You go to church Sunday, but I don't.
[00:52:01.180 --> 00:52:03.320]   And that's about the only difference that they see.
[00:52:03.320 --> 00:52:08.260]   And so we've assimilated so well, that there is no offense.
[00:52:08.260 --> 00:52:09.900]   We've taken away the offense of the Gospel.
[00:52:09.900 --> 00:52:14.860]   The Gospel basically says, "Jesus Christ is the only way."
[00:52:14.860 --> 00:52:20.860]   There's no name under heaven which has been given, other than man, Jesus Christ, by which
[00:52:20.860 --> 00:52:23.220]   we must be saved.
[00:52:23.220 --> 00:52:24.220]   Nobody.
[00:52:24.220 --> 00:52:28.020]   So if you're a Buddhist, you can't be saved.
[00:52:28.020 --> 00:52:30.300]   You're a Muslim, you can't be saved.
[00:52:30.300 --> 00:52:32.820]   You're an atheist, you can't be saved.
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:35.940]   That's a central message of the Gospel.
[00:52:35.940 --> 00:52:38.600]   That Jesus Christ is the only way.
[00:52:38.600 --> 00:52:44.380]   But if we've assimilated in such a way that they don't see any difference, of course we're
[00:52:44.380 --> 00:52:46.980]   not going to be persecuted.
[00:52:46.980 --> 00:52:49.780]   Bible never tells us to look for persecution.
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:53.340]   Go look for, "Oh, now I've got to be persecuted."
[00:52:53.340 --> 00:52:57.180]   And then you go out and say, "Hey, you!"
[00:52:57.180 --> 00:52:58.420]   And we start acting like jerks.
[00:52:58.420 --> 00:53:01.860]   It's like, no, that's not what the Bible's calling us to do.
[00:53:01.860 --> 00:53:08.100]   But it says, "Everyone who strives to live a godly life will be persecuted.
[00:53:08.100 --> 00:53:11.100]   You will experience pushback.
[00:53:11.100 --> 00:53:12.360]   You're not going to be welcome.
[00:53:12.360 --> 00:53:14.360]   Some people will thank you.
[00:53:14.360 --> 00:53:17.500]   Just like if you flip on the light and they say, "Oh my gosh, what is that?"
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:22.820]   And then they realize, "Oh shoot, if I miss today, I'm going to get dropped."
[00:53:22.820 --> 00:53:26.140]   And once they realize that, they're going to thank you.
[00:53:26.140 --> 00:53:27.700]   Thank you.
[00:53:27.700 --> 00:53:30.020]   Thank you for preaching the Gospel to me.
[00:53:30.020 --> 00:53:32.260]   Thank you for turning the lights on.
[00:53:32.260 --> 00:53:37.060]   But those who don't recognize the danger that they're in, that you've been trying to warn
[00:53:37.060 --> 00:53:40.780]   them, and the hope that we have in Christ, they're not going to thank you.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.540]   They're going to say, "You're one of those guys."
[00:53:44.540 --> 00:53:47.500]   And they're not going to invite you to lunch, because you're going to make them feel uncomfortable.
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:50.780]   Yes, it's going to be awkward at work.
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:53.260]   It's going to be very awkward at work.
[00:53:53.260 --> 00:53:58.020]   You know, let me finish with this.
[00:53:58.020 --> 00:54:04.380]   You know, years ago, when we went to Romania, you know, we were preparing, and again, there's
[00:54:04.380 --> 00:54:07.860]   a lot of, there's a big story behind that, but we're going to Romania, and we were on
[00:54:07.860 --> 00:54:12.420]   the road for 44 hours, because we got the cheapest flight you can possibly get from
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:13.420]   here to Romania.
[00:54:13.420 --> 00:54:19.220]   So, we went to Atlanta, to New York, to Paris, to Bucharest, and we got off at Bucharest,
[00:54:19.220 --> 00:54:22.660]   and it was another eight hour drive to where we were going.
[00:54:22.660 --> 00:54:27.180]   So, we said, "You know, let's make the best of this, since we're on the road so long,
[00:54:27.180 --> 00:54:30.380]   let's try to share the Gospel while we're on the airplane."
[00:54:30.380 --> 00:54:34.340]   So, we're telling them, "So, we're all praying, and we're trying to share the Gospel, and
[00:54:34.340 --> 00:54:36.460]   some of us sat together, so we couldn't."
[00:54:36.460 --> 00:54:41.860]   But Pastor Mark happened to always sit next to non-Christians, and sometimes he would
[00:54:41.860 --> 00:54:44.540]   be in the middle, sometimes he would be at the end, but he was always with non-Christians.
[00:54:44.540 --> 00:54:49.660]   So, first leg, you know, we're going to Atlanta, and he got engaged in a conversation, and
[00:54:49.660 --> 00:54:53.500]   I turned around, and I said, "Oh, yeah, you know, Mark is sharing the Gospel, that's great."
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:56.900]   And then, it's about halfway through the trip, we look over, and you could totally tell he
[00:54:56.900 --> 00:55:01.620]   got rejected, because the guy was looking through the window, and Pastor Mark was looking
[00:55:01.620 --> 00:55:04.780]   the other way.
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:07.220]   Sure enough, we get to Atlanta, and I said, "Did you share the Gospel?"
[00:55:07.220 --> 00:55:08.220]   He said, "Yes."
[00:55:08.220 --> 00:55:09.740]   And so, I assumed he wasn't receptive.
[00:55:09.740 --> 00:55:10.740]   He's like, "No."
[00:55:10.740 --> 00:55:11.740]   So, it was very awkward.
[00:55:11.740 --> 00:55:12.740]   He got out, and they got out.
[00:55:12.740 --> 00:55:16.380]   So, the second leg, he goes in, and says, "Okay, let's pray, and let's do it."
[00:55:16.380 --> 00:55:17.380]   We get in.
[00:55:17.380 --> 00:55:19.460]   Right off the bat, we see him sharing the Gospel.
[00:55:19.460 --> 00:55:21.260]   You know, I said, "Great, you know, he's sharing the Gospel."
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:26.420]   Halfway through the trip, we look over, and you could tell they're looking the other direction.
[00:55:26.420 --> 00:55:29.140]   And I was kind of like, "Oh, man, it didn't work," you know.
[00:55:29.140 --> 00:55:32.060]   So, sure enough, we get off, and we tell him, "So, what happened?"
[00:55:32.060 --> 00:55:33.300]   He's like, "Yeah, I shared the Gospel."
[00:55:33.300 --> 00:55:34.300]   He wasn't interested.
[00:55:34.300 --> 00:55:36.980]   In fact, he was kind of upset, you know.
[00:55:36.980 --> 00:55:39.540]   And so, the rest of the trip was very awkward.
[00:55:39.540 --> 00:55:44.660]   So, the second, this is a long trip over to Paris, and I said, "This time, let's wait
[00:55:44.660 --> 00:55:45.660]   a little bit."
[00:55:45.660 --> 00:55:51.580]   So, there wouldn't be, you know, like 10 hours of awkwardness, maybe a couple hours of awkwardness.
[00:55:51.580 --> 00:55:55.500]   So, we waited and waited, and sure enough, you know, halfway through, he was sharing
[00:55:55.500 --> 00:55:57.940]   the Gospel, and you could tell.
[00:55:57.940 --> 00:56:01.100]   And I shouldn't have laughed, but I laughed.
[00:56:01.100 --> 00:56:04.860]   We looked, and you could tell, and he was sitting in the window.
[00:56:04.860 --> 00:56:08.140]   The whole trip, he was looking out the window.
[00:56:08.140 --> 00:56:12.020]   And the guy, you could tell, he was just annoyed, you know.
[00:56:12.020 --> 00:56:19.780]   Now, I share this because I know that many of you are avoiding this because of that at
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:22.340]   work.
[00:56:22.340 --> 00:56:23.340]   And I know.
[00:56:23.340 --> 00:56:25.940]   Who wants to be a weirdo?
[00:56:25.940 --> 00:56:28.140]   Who wants to be that guy?
[00:56:28.140 --> 00:56:29.140]   Right?
[00:56:29.140 --> 00:56:31.820]   I mean, naturally, we don't.
[00:56:31.820 --> 00:56:36.020]   And we try so hard to avoid that.
[00:56:36.020 --> 00:56:46.020]   But the reality is, if they don't know Jesus, they won't live.
[00:56:46.020 --> 00:56:49.180]   They won't live.
[00:56:49.180 --> 00:56:51.940]   That's why you and I are here.
[00:56:51.940 --> 00:56:53.900]   That's why we're taking your offering.
[00:56:53.900 --> 00:56:55.900]   You're hard-earned money.
[00:56:55.900 --> 00:57:00.020]   So we can put that toward bringing more people to Christ.
[00:57:00.020 --> 00:57:01.820]   That's why we're praying.
[00:57:01.820 --> 00:57:04.060]   That's why we're singing these songs.
[00:57:04.060 --> 00:57:08.300]   That's why we have fellowships, so we can stir up one another to remind each other,
[00:57:08.300 --> 00:57:10.340]   this is why we're gathered together.
[00:57:10.340 --> 00:57:12.340]   This is why we have mission trips.
[00:57:12.340 --> 00:57:14.180]   This is why we're sending out people.
[00:57:14.180 --> 00:57:23.220]   I mean, you know, we don't say it much, but Pastor Alex and Jen and Hatton are going to
[00:57:23.220 --> 00:57:27.460]   a country, and then again, I know there's others going, but are going to a country permanently
[00:57:27.460 --> 00:57:30.860]   where everybody's telling you to don't go in.
[00:57:30.860 --> 00:57:35.940]   The air quality itself will keep the majority of the people away.
[00:57:35.940 --> 00:57:38.100]   I mean, they're going to leave behind their friends.
[00:57:38.100 --> 00:57:42.580]   They're going to leave behind their comfort, In-N-Out Burger, Mexican food.
[00:57:42.580 --> 00:57:45.260]   Seems like that's what everybody misses when they go abroad.
[00:57:45.260 --> 00:57:46.260]   Mexican food.
[00:57:46.260 --> 00:57:49.940]   They have boba, so they're not going to miss boba.
[00:57:49.940 --> 00:57:52.300]   But they're leaving all that behind.
[00:57:52.300 --> 00:58:01.380]   They like adventure, because Chinese food.
[00:58:01.380 --> 00:58:08.860]   Because they're living consistently what you and I profess every single Sunday, that there's
[00:58:08.860 --> 00:58:11.540]   nothing more important than this.
[00:58:11.540 --> 00:58:13.420]   Why did all those people go up north?
[00:58:13.420 --> 00:58:18.460]   And I know some of them live up north, and you know, Pastor Aaron, I know, went for the
[00:58:18.460 --> 00:58:21.820]   gospel, I know that.
[00:58:21.820 --> 00:58:23.740]   Why did they go?
[00:58:23.740 --> 00:58:27.180]   Why are people going out to India?
[00:58:27.180 --> 00:58:30.700]   Why are we doing this?
[00:58:30.700 --> 00:58:39.180]   Because you and I have been convinced that life is found in Christ, and Christ alone.
[00:58:39.180 --> 00:58:40.180]   That's why we're doing this.
[00:58:40.180 --> 00:58:43.200]   And that's what we're going to continue to do.
[00:58:43.200 --> 00:58:49.020]   And that's what I hope, as I wrestle with this, as we see the world, and what it is,
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.860]   and how the harvest is plentiful, and the workers are few, and as I'm wrestling with
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:56.380]   this, I'm praying that you would wrestle with me.
[00:58:56.380 --> 00:58:57.380]   Now what?
[00:58:57.380 --> 00:58:58.380]   What do we do with this blessing?
[00:58:58.380 --> 00:59:01.220]   What do we do with all that God has given us?
[00:59:01.220 --> 00:59:06.540]   And hopefully, we, together, can figure this out, and live a life truly worthy of the gospel
[00:59:06.540 --> 00:59:07.540]   of Jesus Christ.
[00:59:07.540 --> 00:59:08.540]   Would you pray with me?
[00:59:08.540 --> 00:59:14.380]   We take a few minutes to come before the Lord.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:17.180]   Again, just an honest prayer.
[00:59:17.180 --> 00:59:20.420]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:59:20.420 --> 00:59:23.220]   I want to be sincere.
[00:59:23.220 --> 00:59:28.420]   I want to be a man that's consistent with the things that I profess.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:34.020]   To take a few minutes to pray, say, "God, I don't want to be a cultural Christian.
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.940]   I want to be a worshiper who will worship you."
