[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   Alright, by way of introduction, there was a time, I remember so distinctly because there
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:13.520]   was this individual who was so disturbed.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.320]   And it happened to be in an environment where I went to a Christian debate, somebody who
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:25.360]   was extremely well versed, someone who had a lot of earthly accolades in terms of education,
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:29.560]   he had a PhD, and he was debating a non-Christian.
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:34.080]   And they had one of those Q&A times at the end of the debate, and there was this man
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:35.640]   who was so disturbed.
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:42.720]   And his question was essentially this, "How in the world do angels fall?"
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:50.240]   And his question was basically, "How does an angel who sees God, the power of God, decide
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:53.040]   either not to believe or to rebel?"
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:58.000]   And then he followed up by saying, "If an angel who was in the presence of God thus
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:06.240]   decided to rebel, what prevents me, if I become Christian, what prevents me from falling subsequently?
[00:01:06.240 --> 00:01:08.880]   What prevents me from falling away from the faith, so to speak?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:11.360]   What prevents me from losing my salvation?
[00:01:11.360 --> 00:01:16.240]   And is there any security, even if I go to heaven and become a glorified being, or maybe
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:21.000]   even become an angel," he said, "that I would remain with God forever?"
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.760]   And what was really interesting to me was that there was no answer.
[00:01:24.760 --> 00:01:28.400]   And at the time, I was only in high school, I was a senior in high school.
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:32.960]   And so, it really perplexed everyone.
[00:01:32.960 --> 00:01:36.280]   And the guy was literally almost in tears.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:39.960]   And what I found really interesting about that is, does the Scripture have something
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.520]   to answer for that?
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:44.560]   Maybe not about the angels, but at least for us.
[00:01:44.560 --> 00:01:48.120]   At least for us, is there any kind of security?
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:53.640]   Now the dilemma, the problem is this, is that on one end, you have this guy who is almost
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.720]   like, "I don't want to get into something that's not going to last forever."
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:01:57.720]   Or he's doubting.
[00:01:57.720 --> 00:01:59.800]   If angels can fall, then what about us?
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:04.760]   And he's essentially in a state of, again, both fear and being perplexed.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:09.000]   But then the dilemma is, you have people on the opposite spectrum of that.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.680]   Once saved, always saved, don't ever make me doubt my salvation.
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:15.960]   I'm gold, right?
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:20.640]   And there are preachers who would say, "What the point of Christianity is, is that you
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:22.040]   would have assurance.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:28.320]   So therefore, right now, everyone, don't you dare, don't you dare doubt whether you are
[00:02:28.320 --> 00:02:29.320]   truly saved.
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:32.320]   You are saved, you're going to be saved, and you're always going to be saved.
[00:02:32.320 --> 00:02:33.320]   No matter what you do.
[00:02:33.320 --> 00:02:35.680]   It's not about what you do, it's absolutely nothing about what you do.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:38.920]   No matter how far you fall, you will never be lost.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:41.280]   You know, that kind of idea.
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:44.120]   So the dilemma is essentially, you have two extremes.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.240]   Where one, too much fear, the other, they don't care.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:52.640]   And so, how do we address this topic, biblically?
[00:02:52.640 --> 00:02:56.360]   And so today we're going to be talking about the perseverance of the saints.
[00:02:56.360 --> 00:02:57.360]   Okay?
[00:02:57.360 --> 00:02:58.360]   Perseverance of the saints.
[00:02:58.360 --> 00:03:04.000]   And I do want you guys to take note of the fact that, you know, in our theology class,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.160]   we're going to be talking about it in those terms.
[00:03:07.160 --> 00:03:11.720]   Perseverance of the saints, as opposed to some well-known terms that people use, such
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:13.280]   as eternal security.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:14.280]   Okay?
[00:03:14.280 --> 00:03:15.280]   Eternal security.
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.640]   Or little, like, cliche phrases such as, "One saved, always saved."
[00:03:21.640 --> 00:03:25.040]   Now, I want you to turn your Bibles to a very pivotal passage.
[00:03:25.040 --> 00:03:26.720]   A very pivotal passage.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:30.040]   And that passage comes from Hebrews chapter 6.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:37.160]   We're essentially answering this question, "Do we have any security?"
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:39.160]   And can a Christian essentially lose his salvation?
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:43.600]   If he can, then I'm not sure if I want that kind of salvation, right?
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:49.000]   If you turn your Bibles over to Hebrews chapter 6, we're going to a very pivotal passage.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.080]   And I'm going to start reading for us first from verse 1, and then we're going to go to
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.080]   verse 9.
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:56.080]   Okay.
[00:03:56.080 --> 00:04:05.800]   It says, "Therefore, leaving the elementary teaching about the Christ, let us press on
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.240]   to maturity, not having again, laying again a foundation of repentance from dead words
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:16.240]   and faith toward God, of instruction about washing and laying on of hands, and the resurrection
[00:04:16.240 --> 00:04:18.360]   of the dead, and eternal judgment.
[00:04:18.360 --> 00:04:20.920]   And this we will do if God permits.
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:25.040]   For in the case of those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:31.760]   gifts, and have been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:36.680]   of the Lord, and the power of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:41.920]   to renew them again to repentance, since they again crucify for themselves the Son of God,
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:44.400]   and put Him to open shame.
[00:04:44.400 --> 00:04:48.760]   For ground that drinks the rain, which often falls on it, and brings forth vegetation useful
[00:04:48.760 --> 00:04:53.640]   to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives a blessing from God.
[00:04:53.640 --> 00:04:57.960]   But if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless, and close to being cursed, and
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:00.680]   it ends up being burned.
[00:05:00.680 --> 00:05:04.480]   But beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning you, and things that accompany
[00:05:04.480 --> 00:05:05.480]   salvation.
[00:05:05.480 --> 00:05:08.080]   Though we are speaking in this way.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:09.080]   Alright?
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:14.480]   So, sorry I've got a mad, like huge canker sore like right here, and every time I talk
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.480]   it's like, anyway, it's hurting me.
[00:05:18.480 --> 00:05:27.120]   Okay, this passage is extremely pivotal because this is actually one of the main verses that
[00:05:27.120 --> 00:05:33.000]   people in two separate camps return to in addressing the topic of whether it be they
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.960]   address it as eternal security, or address it as perseverance of the saints.
[00:05:37.960 --> 00:05:40.920]   And the two camps that exist are such as these.
[00:05:40.920 --> 00:05:47.560]   Number one, we have a group called the Armenian Theologies, or Arminianism, and it's also
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:50.520]   generally termed Wesleyan, okay?
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:56.760]   You will never find a church that's called Irvine Armenian Community Church, or rather
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:06:01.440]   you would hear a church called Irvine Wesleyan Church or so forth, okay?
[00:06:01.440 --> 00:06:06.800]   Reason being is because Arminian, when you say someone is Arminian, you're talking about
[00:06:06.800 --> 00:06:12.080]   the camp of the school of theology, but when you talk about Wesleyan, you're talking about
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.160]   a branch of a movement, okay?
[00:06:15.160 --> 00:06:19.480]   A branch of a movement that essentially came out from that Arminian thinking.
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:25.520]   Now, underneath your notes about the Arminian theology or Wesleyan, you can write a couple
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:27.800]   things, okay?
[00:06:27.800 --> 00:06:35.240]   Basically, Arminian theology is dedicated to the love of God and genuine relationship,
[00:06:35.240 --> 00:06:37.960]   thus the free will of man, okay?
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:43.120]   And you guys have heard this from me before, that they're dedicated to the love of God,
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.480]   genuine relationship, and the free will of man, okay?
[00:06:47.480 --> 00:06:51.640]   That being the case, basically in the love of God, God has made atonement available ready
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:53.640]   for all, okay?
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:06:55.200]   All of mankind.
[00:06:55.200 --> 00:07:03.400]   And what He has done is given mankind free will and a choice whether to receive or to
[00:07:03.400 --> 00:07:05.040]   resist.
[00:07:05.040 --> 00:07:09.240]   The reason why He did that is because He wanted the genuine relationship, right?
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:11.880]   He wanted the genuine relationship.
[00:07:11.880 --> 00:07:20.280]   Therefore, man has the choice whether to resist the call of God or to receive it.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.520]   That being the case, when you think about basically, if you work your way back from
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:31.600]   the kind of theology of the salvation process that we've been studying, everything from
[00:07:31.600 --> 00:07:37.160]   the reception and the conversion is according to the choice, then so is the calling.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:39.560]   The choice is conditional and then so is the election.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   The election is conditional.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:45.400]   And if you shoot the other way to the future, guess what?
[00:07:45.400 --> 00:07:52.560]   The eternity aspect of it, the future projection of our salvation is also conditional.
[00:07:52.560 --> 00:07:54.560]   It's conditioned upon our perseverance.
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:08:00.560]   Therefore, for an Armenian theologian, you can lose your salvation.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:02.480]   You can lose your salvation.
[00:08:02.480 --> 00:08:07.240]   And this passage is the passage that they turn to, to show us that you can.
[00:08:07.240 --> 00:08:10.440]   And let me give you some biblical evidences that they project.
[00:08:10.440 --> 00:08:16.080]   First, when you look at this passage, just from straight reading, it almost sounds like
[00:08:16.080 --> 00:08:17.320]   that.
[00:08:17.320 --> 00:08:18.880]   It truly sounds like someone who's a believer.
[00:08:18.880 --> 00:08:23.320]   And he says, "There is a case, there are those individuals," I'm reading in verse 4, "There
[00:08:23.320 --> 00:08:27.840]   are these individuals who notice these key terms, that they have been enlightened."
[00:08:27.840 --> 00:08:30.240]   Interesting.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:31.240]   What types of people are enlightened?
[00:08:31.240 --> 00:08:35.840]   "They have tasted the heavenly gifts and have been made partakers."
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:40.040]   And so for you on your packet, I've highlighted the ones that they really emphasize, which
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   are these terms.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:47.120]   First, there's enlightened in verse 4, but furthermore, the partakers of the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:51.560]   They believe, if you're talking about, yeah, maybe some of these other terms, where you're
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:55.360]   kind of enlightened, you can think of it as maybe you received a bunch of teaching, and
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:56.880]   now you've gained wisdom.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:01.640]   But man, how can you say that somebody who is a partaker of the Holy Spirit is thus not
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:02.640]   saved?
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:08.520]   Furthermore, there's another one that's really, that they pose as this kind of really shows,
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:13.220]   this verse really shows, that the individual that is being referred to in this passage
[00:09:13.220 --> 00:09:14.220]   is truly Christian.
[00:09:14.220 --> 00:09:20.120]   And what they turn to is, if you look in verse 6, this is what it says, "And then have fallen
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:21.120]   away."
[00:09:21.120 --> 00:09:23.120]   So they've come and experienced all this stuff, right?
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:26.440]   And it says in verse 6, "And then they've fallen away.
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:31.880]   It is impossible to renew them again to repentance."
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.840]   So the idea is, how can you renew and do again something you haven't done before?
[00:09:36.840 --> 00:09:41.900]   But obviously, if they have done it before, that is what we're talking about, right?
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:46.840]   And what's really interesting is, in the Armenian theology, what you'll have is even within
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.360]   that different opinions then.
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:55.960]   Okay, so if we as a Christian can in our volition resist the Holy Spirit and then we lose our
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.760]   salvation, can we pick it back up again?
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:02.440]   According to this passage, if you really want to take this passage at face value, you'd
[00:10:02.440 --> 00:10:03.440]   almost have to say what?
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:04.440]   No, you can't.
[00:10:04.440 --> 00:10:05.440]   Because you can't, right?
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:10.520]   But in their mind, there are some people who would say, "No, you could."
[00:10:10.520 --> 00:10:15.060]   You could basically, if it's saying you could be renewed into repentance, then you can.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:17.440]   So you go basically back and forth.
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.920]   But nonetheless, this is the kind of theology that they're projecting.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.840]   And this is the kind of, actually, theology that was pervasive in the kind of church that
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:29.640]   I essentially got saved at and grew up as, as a youth group student.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.720]   Which is really interesting to think about, okay?
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:35.280]   Why did I say it was really interesting to think about?
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:39.040]   Because experience confirmed it for me.
[00:10:39.040 --> 00:10:40.040]   Okay?
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.440]   Now think about this.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.560]   If you're a young student, you become saved and you're taught this theology, and then
[00:10:46.560 --> 00:10:50.400]   when you come out of high school and you see basically like 80% of your friends who walked
[00:10:50.400 --> 00:10:55.880]   with you in the faith fall away, basically experience that starts to confirm what you've
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:57.560]   just been taught, right?
[00:10:57.560 --> 00:11:01.620]   And so essentially with Armenian theology, they'll say, "Yes, it is seen in Scripture
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:07.160]   right here, these people have been enlightened, they're partakers, and they've, in a sense,
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:11.080]   by inference, they have once repented."
[00:11:11.080 --> 00:11:13.880]   And so that being the case, it's also confirmed our experience.
[00:11:13.880 --> 00:11:15.280]   That is Armenian theology.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:16.280]   Okay?
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:19.480]   Any questions about that so far?
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:21.080]   Alright.
[00:11:21.080 --> 00:11:30.080]   However, I think if you just take a moment to look at both the context and what these
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:34.440]   terms refer to, you'd come to an entirely different conclusion.
[00:11:34.440 --> 00:11:39.160]   The other camp in reference to this idea of perseverance of the saints or eternal security,
[00:11:39.160 --> 00:11:43.240]   as opposed to external security, is the Calvinistic thinking, Calvinism.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:44.240]   Okay?
[00:11:44.240 --> 00:11:50.320]   Now I'm not going to delve into all that Calvinism is, but essentially Calvinism is dedicated
[00:11:50.320 --> 00:11:52.480]   to the sovereignty of God.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:58.120]   Now if you talk to an Armenian, they're going to say, "Of course we are dedicated to the
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.120]   sovereignty of God."
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.120]   They are.
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.120]   They really are.
[00:12:01.120 --> 00:12:05.440]   However, in their definition of the sovereignty of God, God has limited Himself.
[00:12:05.440 --> 00:12:09.880]   In their definition of the sovereignty of God, there is an area where God volitionally
[00:12:09.880 --> 00:12:11.880]   will not touch, which is your free will.
[00:12:11.880 --> 00:12:13.480]   Does that make sense?
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:17.720]   So don't ever accuse an Armenian, "Oh my gosh, you don't believe in the sovereignty of God."
[00:12:17.720 --> 00:12:22.520]   Well, philosophically and logically, you can get them there.
[00:12:22.520 --> 00:12:28.640]   However, when they espouse a theological system, that's not what they would say.
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:33.320]   But basically, with Calvinism, it essentially says, "God is sovereign, and His will cannot
[00:12:33.320 --> 00:12:38.600]   be frustrated, not even by the person whom He's having this relationship with."
[00:12:38.600 --> 00:12:45.040]   So who God has called with His unconditional election, with His irresistible grace, God
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:48.080]   is going to secure all the way to eternity.
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:49.640]   No one will lose their salvation.
[00:12:49.640 --> 00:12:50.640]   Why?
[00:12:50.640 --> 00:12:51.640]   Because God is sovereign.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:52.640]   Right?
[00:12:52.640 --> 00:12:53.640]   Because God is sovereign.
[00:12:53.640 --> 00:12:59.680]   So for an individual, they're either going to be saved or unsaved, boom, that's the dividing
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:00.680]   line.
[00:13:00.680 --> 00:13:03.960]   That's the kind of way that Calvinistic theology will work.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   And biblically speaking, now let's take a look at this passage.
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:07.960]   Okay?
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:11.680]   So look down in Hebrews, and let's take a look at your passage.
[00:13:11.680 --> 00:13:16.640]   First notice, and I think we referenced it in one of the Q&A of the previous session,
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:24.320]   but you do have to take a note that he, the author, in context, is challenging a group
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:28.200]   of Christians who are nearly falling away.
[00:13:28.200 --> 00:13:29.520]   It's a mixed batch of people.
[00:13:29.520 --> 00:13:31.860]   Some of them are getting swayed by the Jews.
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.600]   Some of them are getting swayed back to their previous life.
[00:13:34.600 --> 00:13:38.080]   And there are people who are in danger of falling into disbelief.
[00:13:38.080 --> 00:13:41.160]   So those individuals, he's giving a strong rebuke.
[00:13:41.160 --> 00:13:46.560]   And so what he says is, "In the case of those," so now he's talking about a unique case
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.520]   or a class of people.
[00:13:48.520 --> 00:13:49.520]   Right?
[00:13:49.520 --> 00:13:50.920]   A class of people.
[00:13:50.920 --> 00:13:55.200]   So what type of class or what type of people is he referring to?
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:59.560]   Well, you look at these terms that the Arminius would look at and they'll say, "Okay, you've
[00:13:59.560 --> 00:14:01.160]   been enlightened.
[00:14:01.160 --> 00:14:04.160]   You have tasted, you've been made a partaker.
[00:14:04.160 --> 00:14:06.560]   And then you have seen the power of the come to the age."
[00:14:06.560 --> 00:14:10.280]   Or you have been doing this and doing this, right?
[00:14:10.280 --> 00:14:14.160]   Essentially these terms, I want you guys to read for homework.
[00:14:14.160 --> 00:14:16.360]   There's a little article in the back.
[00:14:16.360 --> 00:14:21.760]   But these terms are not exclusively Christian terms.
[00:14:21.760 --> 00:14:26.480]   Meaning in other passages through Scripture, these terms are used in more broad and general
[00:14:26.480 --> 00:14:27.480]   senses.
[00:14:27.480 --> 00:14:28.480]   Whether it be enlightened.
[00:14:28.480 --> 00:14:32.160]   Where enlightened is not a sense of knowledge unto salvation.
[00:14:32.160 --> 00:14:36.360]   But you can be enlightened as in, there's a light shining on you.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:39.680]   There's been knowledge given to you and preached at you.
[00:14:39.680 --> 00:14:41.600]   And so you've gained facts.
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:42.600]   Right?
[00:14:42.600 --> 00:14:48.280]   And even the idea of a partaker, you know when the disciples, they do a lot of, a lot
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:54.960]   of these disciples were average workers or even some people in official positions.
[00:14:54.960 --> 00:14:57.000]   And then some were fishermen.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:00.280]   When some of them are talking, when the New Testament Gospels are talking about their
[00:15:00.280 --> 00:15:05.480]   work as fishermen, their passage will say, "Oh, he was a partaker with them in fishing."
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:10.320]   But it doesn't mean like he was a partaker as in the Spirit indwelt his heart and sealed
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:11.320]   him for salvation.
[00:15:11.320 --> 00:15:12.320]   No.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:15.000]   It doesn't mean like he was a partaker meaning he was doing the work.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Okay?
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:19.520]   So a lot of these terms are not exclusively Christian terms.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:23.080]   Such as justified.
[00:15:23.080 --> 00:15:27.400]   If someone is justified in the sight of God, that is an exclusively Christian term.
[00:15:27.400 --> 00:15:31.320]   That is an act of God that we learn through our process of salvation.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.320]   Adopted.
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:36.000]   What does it ever say of these individuals that they've been adopted by God as we've
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   been learning so far?
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Atoned for.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.760]   There are exclusive Christian terms that aren't referenced here.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:52.200]   But furthermore, if you look at this, when it says that it is impossible to renew them
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:59.480]   again to repentance, the author is telling us essentially that if all of these blessings,
[00:15:59.480 --> 00:16:03.640]   if all of these things that they're partaking and are experiencing, if they're rejecting
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:06.560]   this, what more can you do?
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:07.560]   Right?
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:08.960]   So essentially that's the point.
[00:16:08.960 --> 00:16:12.360]   It almost, almost sounds Christian.
[00:16:12.360 --> 00:16:13.800]   But that's the point.
[00:16:13.800 --> 00:16:19.280]   These people, in the case of these, they were like so close, they were so near, they were
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:23.440]   in our church, they were fellowshipping, maybe they even went on missions with us, but does
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:25.640]   that mean they are saved?
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:26.640]   Absolutely not.
[00:16:26.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   Alright?
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.460]   Absolutely not.
[00:16:29.460 --> 00:16:34.840]   And so the author actually intentionally makes these people sound like Christian, but he's
[00:16:34.840 --> 00:16:36.440]   making the point that they are not.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.120]   They've rejected everything about Christianity.
[00:16:39.120 --> 00:16:43.280]   And so if you were to challenge these individuals, these people who are falling away, if you
[00:16:43.280 --> 00:16:46.200]   were to challenge them with the Word of God and say, "Be aligned with the Word," they
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   would say, "Meh."
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:51.000]   "Pray in the Holy Spirit that the Holy Spirit empowers you."
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   "Meh."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   Right?
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:56.240]   "Be partakers of our ministry and labor with us and see the power of God."
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   "Meh."
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.920]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:16:58.920 --> 00:17:05.000]   And so that's partially why actually right now there is a great movement towards psychology
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:10.760]   and what's called spiritual formation that has integrated Christian theology and secular
[00:17:10.760 --> 00:17:12.560]   psychology.
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:16.400]   The reason why I think that's so dangerous is because a lot of that is conditioning.
[00:17:16.400 --> 00:17:18.080]   A lot of that is experience.
[00:17:18.080 --> 00:17:24.840]   A lot of that is, "Hey, remember a time when you were in the preliminary stages of your
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.840]   Christian life?
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:28.520]   You were really hungry for God and you were really thirsty after Him?
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:31.560]   Why don't you go back and redo all that stuff?
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:35.120]   If there was a hill or a mountain you prayed on, go back to that hill."
[00:17:35.120 --> 00:17:39.000]   And it makes you do all this conditioning and repetition of actions.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:45.800]   But in my mind, what this passage is saying is if they rejected all that at one time,
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:49.480]   now it's just going to harden them even more.
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:51.520]   You see what it's saying?
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:54.880]   Part of it's saying when it says that you can't renew them again to repentance, it's
[00:17:54.880 --> 00:17:56.160]   not repentance into salvation.
[00:17:56.160 --> 00:17:59.320]   It's saying you can't bring them to this remorse over their sin.
[00:17:59.320 --> 00:18:01.880]   You can't bring them to change their mind.
[00:18:01.880 --> 00:18:03.560]   They've been hardened.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:04.560]   Right?
[00:18:04.560 --> 00:18:06.080]   Because repentance is a change of mind.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.080]   You think about it differently.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:11.720]   You do a U-turn in your concept of your life and your sin or whether you're going to be
[00:18:11.720 --> 00:18:12.720]   approaching God.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:19.400]   And so that being the case, this passage is not talking about Christians losing their
[00:18:19.400 --> 00:18:20.400]   salvation.
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:24.960]   It's talking about those individuals who are so close, experiencing all that Christianity
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:30.000]   has to offer, seeing all the power of God at work in the church and then saying, "Forget
[00:18:30.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   it."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:34.000]   This passage is saying there is nothing left for them.
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.680]   They're not Christian.
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:40.000]   Now, the point where I believe it's really emphatically clear that it's not Christian
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:41.560]   is actually verse 7 through 9.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:42.560]   Look at this.
[00:18:42.560 --> 00:18:46.400]   In verse 7 through 9 it says, "For the ground that drinks the rain which often falls on
[00:18:46.400 --> 00:18:53.000]   it brings forth vegetation, useful to those for whose sake it is also tilled, receives
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.040]   a blessing from God, but if it yields thorns and thistles, is worthless and close to being
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:01.760]   cursed and it ends up being burned."
[00:19:01.760 --> 00:19:07.440]   He's using a very common agricultural analogy metaphor where everybody would understand
[00:19:07.440 --> 00:19:12.520]   this chaff, this useless stuff being burned.
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:17.280]   Does that sound like somebody who happened to have been adopted, redeemed in the grace
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:18.280]   of God?
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.280]   Absolutely not.
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:24.040]   Verse 8 through 9 solidifies this truth that this is not talking about a Christian.
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:25.040]   Why?
[00:19:25.040 --> 00:19:28.520]   Because in verse 9 it says, "But beloved, we are convinced of better things concerning
[00:19:28.520 --> 00:19:32.000]   you, things that accompany salvation."
[00:19:32.000 --> 00:19:35.440]   What he's saying essentially, I am comparing and contrasting.
[00:19:35.440 --> 00:19:42.600]   I'm almost talking to you in this way like a non-Christian, but of you I am more convinced
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:44.720]   that there are things that accompany salvation.
[00:19:44.720 --> 00:19:49.520]   So by way of comparing and contrasting in relation to verse 4 where he brings up a case
[00:19:49.520 --> 00:19:54.400]   scenario of these people, it's very clear that this passage is talking about individuals
[00:19:54.400 --> 00:19:57.440]   who are never Christian.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:20:01.000]   This is not teaching us that one can lose their salvation.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:06.960]   I felt like I needed to go through this detailed explanation of this passage because this is
[00:20:06.960 --> 00:20:13.120]   a key go-to passage for the other Catholic.
[00:20:13.120 --> 00:20:15.720]   This passage has been a source of confusion for a lot of people.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:20.840]   It sounds like though, yes that was the point, it sounds like it.
[00:20:20.840 --> 00:20:25.400]   It sounds like they're so close and there is your tragedy.
[00:20:25.400 --> 00:20:28.000]   So close and yet so far.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Okay?
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:37.680]   And so for us, we say that again, people do not lose their salvation, but rather if individuals
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.480]   through your experience, through your life as a Christian, if you've been a Christian
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:44.800]   for more than 5 years, you've probably seen people who fall away.
[00:20:44.800 --> 00:20:48.240]   Not just leave Buran to another church, but they just leave.
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:52.640]   And they just leave the church and they never come back.
[00:20:52.640 --> 00:20:55.920]   Those individuals, biblically speaking, were never saved.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:57.200]   Were never saved.
[00:20:57.200 --> 00:21:01.840]   Now, could it be, could it be that they're backsliding and God's going to discipline
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:02.840]   them and draw them back?
[00:21:02.840 --> 00:21:03.840]   Sure.
[00:21:03.840 --> 00:21:08.280]   But if you see an individual who has rejected the faith and denounced the faith, they were
[00:21:08.280 --> 00:21:10.440]   never Christian to begin with.
[00:21:10.440 --> 00:21:12.080]   And the scripture is absolutely clear about that.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:18.240]   If you look in 1 John chapter 1 it says, "They left us because they were never of us."
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.240]   Okay?
[00:21:19.240 --> 00:21:21.320]   They left us because they were never of us.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.400]   Now, that's really experientially, that could be confusing.
[00:21:25.400 --> 00:21:31.240]   Because I have had both praise leaders, my disciples, the guy used to give me a ride
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.000]   every week to church.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.880]   I have people like that who are close to me fall away from the faith.
[00:21:36.880 --> 00:21:40.000]   And explaining that biblically is difficult.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:42.280]   And we need to do it also with great sensitivity.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:43.280]   Right?
[00:21:43.280 --> 00:21:47.040]   However, that's the kind of truth that the scripture reveals to us.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.000]   Now, moving to a different topic.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.040]   We want to talk about this then.
[00:21:52.040 --> 00:21:58.740]   Biblically, the way that scripture presents to us our idea of eternal security is mentioned
[00:21:58.740 --> 00:22:02.080]   into the idea of perseverance for the saints.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.080]   Okay?
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:07.040]   And when we say perseverance of the saints, a good way to think about it is this phrase,
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:09.760]   "Once saved, always persevering."
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:14.840]   Because that joins together dual aspects of the biblical teaching of your security.
[00:22:14.840 --> 00:22:21.240]   Which is, yes, there's an aspect of an assurance that you are once and for all saved.
[00:22:21.240 --> 00:22:25.640]   And then there is an aspect of you need to be forever persevering.
[00:22:25.640 --> 00:22:26.840]   Right?
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:28.520]   You need to be persevering.
[00:22:28.520 --> 00:22:31.080]   And so it brings those two things together.
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:34.440]   Let's tackle the first aspect of it, your assurance.
[00:22:34.440 --> 00:22:41.480]   It is very, very clear through a multitude of verses through the scripture that you in
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:48.440]   your life right now, if you are born again, you should have an absolute confidence and
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.040]   assurance that you will be with God in heaven.
[00:22:53.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   Right?
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:22:56.320]   That you are saved.
[00:22:56.320 --> 00:22:58.960]   And that you are going to be saved.
[00:22:58.960 --> 00:23:01.560]   And you will be forever saved.
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:03.200]   All through eternity.
[00:23:03.200 --> 00:23:05.040]   That kind of assurance we should have today.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:10.480]   It's not something that we're, in the balance and scheme of things, where you could have
[00:23:10.480 --> 00:23:12.480]   fear that, "Oh no, what happens if this?
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:14.640]   What's to save me from let's say 10 years down the line?
[00:23:14.640 --> 00:23:15.640]   If I get really busy?
[00:23:15.640 --> 00:23:19.080]   If I get distracted and I see some of my older brothers and sisters falling away?
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:21.320]   Is that going to be me?"
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:26.080]   What I'm saying is there is, oh no, there is objective truth.
[00:23:26.080 --> 00:23:30.080]   There is objective truth to the idea that you should have eternal security.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:33.080]   Or you should have an assurance of your salvation.
[00:23:33.080 --> 00:23:34.080]   Okay?
[00:23:34.080 --> 00:23:38.080]   And we're not going to tackle every single verse, but I want to highlight to you several.
[00:23:38.080 --> 00:23:43.080]   Number one, if you look down it says, "Passages to teach assurance of salvation."
[00:23:43.080 --> 00:23:47.080]   It says this in John chapter 6, verse 38 through 40.
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:52.080]   "I have come down from heaven, not to do my own will, but the will of Him who sent me."
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:57.080]   And this is the will of Him who sent me, "that I should lose nothing of all that He has given
[00:23:57.080 --> 00:23:59.080]   me, but raise it up in the last day.
[00:23:59.080 --> 00:24:04.080]   For this is the will of my Father, that everyone who sees the Son and believes in Him should
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:10.080]   have eternal life, and I will raise Him up on that last day."
[00:24:10.080 --> 00:24:17.080]   Notice, the emphasis in this verse is this direct result, to those who believe they will
[00:24:17.080 --> 00:24:19.080]   have eternal life.
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.080]   Right?
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:24.080]   Basically, I notice how at the very end of it says, "that everyone who sees the Son and
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:27.080]   believes in Him should have eternal life."
[00:24:27.080 --> 00:24:32.080]   And it's all the more emphatic when Christ says, "I am going to lose nothing."
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:34.080]   Not a single person.
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.080]   Right?
[00:24:35.080 --> 00:24:37.080]   Not a single person.
[00:24:37.080 --> 00:24:43.080]   Another passage that says the exact same thing when Christ essentially explains His role
[00:24:43.080 --> 00:24:48.080]   in this, and He says, "My sheep hear My voice, and I know them, and they follow Me.
[00:24:48.080 --> 00:24:54.080]   I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish, and no one shall snatch them out of
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:55.080]   My hand.
[00:24:55.080 --> 00:25:00.080]   My Father who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one is able to snatch them
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:02.080]   out of My Father's hand."
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:03.080]   Right?
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:10.080]   And so what you realize here is, if your perspective, just like that individual who was at the debate,
[00:25:10.080 --> 00:25:15.080]   because he was not open to the sight of God, because he did not see the glory of Christ,
[00:25:15.080 --> 00:25:20.080]   he was in a state of fear, and that is understandable.
[00:25:20.080 --> 00:25:23.080]   But that should not be the case for a Christian.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.080]   Why?
[00:25:24.080 --> 00:25:27.080]   Because his perspective now includes the power of God.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:31.080]   His perspective now includes the role of Christ.
[00:25:31.080 --> 00:25:36.080]   His sovereign hand holding every single one who is His.
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:41.080]   And so, I want to highlight to you that the most powerful and forceful phrase in this
[00:25:41.080 --> 00:25:44.080]   entire paragraph is this.
[00:25:44.080 --> 00:25:50.080]   In that passage, John chapter 10 verse 27-29, notice how it says right there, right in the
[00:25:50.080 --> 00:25:55.080]   middle, it says, "I give them eternal life, and they shall never perish."
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:56.080]   Right?
[00:25:56.080 --> 00:26:02.080]   That little phrase in the Greek has like, highlight, exclamation points, brackets, and
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:04.080]   like, "Nyaaah!" coming out of it.
[00:26:04.080 --> 00:26:05.080]   Okay?
[00:26:05.080 --> 00:26:08.080]   It's the most emphatic little phrase in that entire paragraph.
[00:26:08.080 --> 00:26:13.080]   The reason why I say that is because, do you remember in Romans, when Apostle Paul says,
[00:26:13.080 --> 00:26:14.080]   "Shall we sin?"
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:16.080]   So that grace bond of bile.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:19.080]   And you guys probably heard this in all the sermons that you guys heard about through
[00:26:19.080 --> 00:26:22.080]   Romans, where they say, and the Greeks is, "Oumee!"
[00:26:22.080 --> 00:26:27.080]   And it basically comes off saying, "No, not, never, ever, period!"
[00:26:27.080 --> 00:26:29.080]   Right?
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:32.080]   That's how it reads in this passage.
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:38.080]   "Oumee!" that you should never, ever, forever perish.
[00:26:38.080 --> 00:26:40.080]   So it's an emphatic phrase.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:45.080]   And so I want to highlight for us, this is the truth that Scripture teaches us.
[00:26:45.080 --> 00:26:47.080]   That he who believes, is secure.
[00:26:47.080 --> 00:26:50.080]   That he who believes, has assurance.
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:55.080]   In Christ, in the power of God, there is guaranteed, yes, the reason why we are not going to fall
[00:26:55.080 --> 00:26:59.080]   like the angels is because, we're not angels.
[00:26:59.080 --> 00:27:03.080]   It's because God sent His protection, always guarding us.
[00:27:03.080 --> 00:27:05.080]   God has His hand on us.
[00:27:05.080 --> 00:27:07.080]   That's the security that we have.
[00:27:07.080 --> 00:27:11.080]   And so if you go forward, there's all these other verses, jump down to the passages from
[00:27:11.080 --> 00:27:13.080]   the epistles.
[00:27:13.080 --> 00:27:18.080]   We're going to go to that passage in Romans chapter 8, 30, just because we've been working
[00:27:18.080 --> 00:27:21.080]   through this idea of the process of salvation.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:27.080]   And in that golden chain of salvation, it says, "And to those whom he predestined, he
[00:27:27.080 --> 00:27:34.080]   called, and to these whom he called, he justified, and these whom he justified, he also glorified."
[00:27:34.080 --> 00:27:39.080]   I want to make this point, because I think it's so amazing.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:43.080]   Every single one of those words, is in the past tense.
[00:27:43.080 --> 00:27:47.080]   If you're not a grammar nerd, if you aren't an English major, and you don't get excited
[00:27:47.080 --> 00:27:51.080]   about grammar, this is a moment when you should.
[00:27:51.080 --> 00:27:52.080]   You ought to.
[00:27:52.080 --> 00:27:53.080]   Why?
[00:27:53.080 --> 00:27:58.080]   Because He's talking about your glorification, He's talking about your end, in the past tense.
[00:27:58.080 --> 00:28:04.080]   It's so sure, it's so guaranteed, He's talking about it in the past tense.
[00:28:04.080 --> 00:28:09.080]   And so that is our God's promise to us, that anyone who is in God, anyone who has genuinely
[00:28:09.080 --> 00:28:16.080]   been elected, who has been called, regenerated, and who has been adopted and secured in Christ,
[00:28:16.080 --> 00:28:20.080]   is going to experience life eternal with Heavenly Father.
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.080]   Life eternal with our Heavenly Father.
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:30.080]   And so, it comes to this very last verse, verse, go to the very bottom, not the very
[00:28:30.080 --> 00:28:34.080]   bottom, but 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 3 through 5.
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.080]   Underneath passages from the epistles, 1 Peter chapter 1 verse 3 through 5.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.080]   And it says, "Blessed be the God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to
[00:28:43.080 --> 00:28:48.080]   His great mercy has caused us to be born again to a living hope through the resurrection
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:53.080]   of Jesus Christ from the dead, to obtain inheritance which is imperishable, undefiled, and will
[00:28:53.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   not fade away, reserved in Heaven for you, who are protected by the power of God through
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   faith for our salvation, ready to be revealed at the last time."
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   So here you have what we've been talking about, this dual aspect.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:14.080]   And when I say dual aspect, it's this idea that the power of God, all that was promised
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:18.080]   to you, the entire inheritance is guarded, is protected.
[00:29:18.080 --> 00:29:25.080]   But notice how He says, it's through the faith that this salvation God has ordained
[00:29:25.080 --> 00:29:28.080]   to be through your persevering faith.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:33.080]   So we come to the second point which is, once saved, always persevering.
[00:29:33.080 --> 00:29:37.080]   Okay, always persevering.
[00:29:37.080 --> 00:29:39.080]   And this part is interesting.
[00:29:39.080 --> 00:29:46.080]   Because at face value, at face value, some of these verses make it sound so conditional.
[00:29:46.080 --> 00:29:51.080]   Some of these verses make it sound so dependent upon your performance.
[00:29:51.080 --> 00:29:54.080]   But let's read some of these truths that come from Scripture.
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:59.080]   In John chapter 8 verse 31 through 32 it says, "So Jesus was saying to those Jews who had
[00:29:59.080 --> 00:30:05.080]   believed Him, 'If you continue in My Word, then you are truly disciples of Mine, and
[00:30:05.080 --> 00:30:09.080]   you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free.'"
[00:30:09.080 --> 00:30:13.080]   There's this big conditional "if", right?
[00:30:13.080 --> 00:30:16.080]   "If", "if you continue".
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:21.080]   Here's another passage, "He who endures to the end will be saved."
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:22.080]   Right?
[00:30:22.080 --> 00:30:25.080]   "He who endures to the end will be saved."
[00:30:25.080 --> 00:30:32.080]   I'm going to read another one, Colossians chapter 1 verse 22 to 23, "Yet He has now
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:36.080]   reconciled you and His fleshly body through death, in order to present you before Him
[00:30:36.080 --> 00:30:39.080]   wholly unblameless and beyond reproach.
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:45.080]   If indeed you continue in the faith firmly established and steadfast, and not move away
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:49.080]   from the hope of the Gospel that you have heard."
[00:30:49.080 --> 00:30:56.080]   So, in this we have essentially this perspective of this doctrine of perseverance of the saints.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.080]   Essentially, you can think of it like this.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:08.080]   When God secures, He's going to secure in a way that looks like perseverance.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:10.080]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:17.080]   God is guaranteeing, God is solidifying and securing, but it looks like perseverance.
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:23.080]   He's going to cause every single individual who is genuine is to persevere to the very end.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:28.080]   And the perseverance to the very end is going to be one of the genuine marks of a Christian.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:31.080]   That's the way we need to see it.
[00:31:31.080 --> 00:31:33.080]   That's the way we need to see it.
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:36.080]   Any questions now about the two?
[00:31:36.080 --> 00:31:38.080]   One saved, always persevering.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:41.080]   I know it was a lot and I'm kind of talking fast because it was a lot of material.
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:44.080]   But any questions?
[00:31:44.080 --> 00:31:51.080]   About Hebrews 6, why we believe that no genuine Christian can lose their salvation.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.080]   Okay?
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:55.080]   Now let's make some application for us.
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:32:01.080]   Let's cause our thoughts to think about how does this really spiritually affect us.
[00:32:01.080 --> 00:32:04.080]   So here's the thing though.
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:07.080]   The disconnect.
[00:32:07.080 --> 00:32:09.080]   The disconnect in Christian circles is this.
[00:32:09.080 --> 00:32:15.080]   The objective truth of our guaranteed inheritance.
[00:32:15.080 --> 00:32:21.080]   The objective truth that when we are saved, we're going to experience eternity with God.
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:22.080]   That is so true.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:25.080]   I actually don't have a problem saying eternal security.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:30.080]   Although I've been kind of fumbling and avoiding that phrase throughout the whole Bible study.
[00:32:30.080 --> 00:32:34.080]   I don't have a problem with it because it's objectively true.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:36.080]   Right?
[00:32:36.080 --> 00:32:38.080]   God is going to secure us.
[00:32:38.080 --> 00:32:39.080]   God is never going to fail.
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:42.080]   And His sovereignty is never going to be thwarted it says.
[00:32:42.080 --> 00:32:45.080]   And so if He has you in His hand, no one is going to overcome.
[00:32:45.080 --> 00:32:48.080]   That's just the objective truth.
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:51.080]   So we as Christians should never shy away from saying that.
[00:32:51.080 --> 00:32:56.080]   Anyone who is truly born in Christ is never going to lose their salvation.
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:57.080]   Right?
[00:32:57.080 --> 00:32:58.080]   Should never.
[00:32:58.080 --> 00:33:00.080]   And you should know, right?
[00:33:00.080 --> 00:33:06.080]   With assurance and with confidence declaring I am God.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:07.080]   We should.
[00:33:07.080 --> 00:33:09.080]   That's what we should be doing as Christians.
[00:33:09.080 --> 00:33:16.080]   But the disconnect is, it's a completely different question from asking is this true?
[00:33:16.080 --> 00:33:17.080]   Yes it is.
[00:33:17.080 --> 00:33:18.080]   Eternal security.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:21.080]   But then asking is this true of you?
[00:33:21.080 --> 00:33:22.080]   Right?
[00:33:22.080 --> 00:33:24.080]   Is this true of you?
[00:33:24.080 --> 00:33:26.080]   And that's where it's so hard.
[00:33:26.080 --> 00:33:28.080]   That's where the if comes.
[00:33:28.080 --> 00:33:36.080]   If this is true of you, then the whole gamut of promises and all that God has said is so true.
[00:33:36.080 --> 00:33:39.080]   And it should warm your heart and it should encourage you and it should make you persevere.
[00:33:39.080 --> 00:33:40.080]   Right?
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:43.080]   But that's just this huge if.
[00:33:43.080 --> 00:33:48.080]   And the reason why the scriptures talk like that is because just think about a Paul scenario.
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:49.080]   He goes from church to church.
[00:33:49.080 --> 00:33:51.080]   Sometimes he's there for three months.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:53.080]   Sometimes he just visits for a day.
[00:33:53.080 --> 00:33:54.080]   Sometimes he doesn't even ever go.
[00:33:54.080 --> 00:33:57.080]   He's just writing a letter.
[00:33:57.080 --> 00:33:59.080]   How is he to know is this true of you?
[00:33:59.080 --> 00:34:04.080]   And furthermore, what he's doing is really all he's doing is observing the external fruits.
[00:34:04.080 --> 00:34:08.080]   But we said earlier someone could be enlightened so they could talk like a Christian.
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   And haven't you seen those people who talk like a Christian?
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.080]   They know all the Christian terminology.
[00:34:13.080 --> 00:34:18.080]   They can answer you back and forth, front and back, and they can tell you all the theological terms.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.080]   And then they fall away.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:22.080]   It's happened before.
[00:34:22.080 --> 00:34:23.080]   I've seen it.
[00:34:23.080 --> 00:34:24.080]   Right?
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:28.080]   And then there are people who have done Christian works.
[00:34:28.080 --> 00:34:31.080]   And then so every time the young guy comes to me and says, "Oh, I like this girl."
[00:34:31.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   I was like, "Why?"
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:33.080]   "Because she's so serving."
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.080]   And I'm like, "That's great.
[00:34:34.080 --> 00:34:38.080]   But you need to tell me more because people can serve, but they can be bitter.
[00:34:38.080 --> 00:34:41.080]   They can be outright rude and mean and angry.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:43.080]   They can even outright be not Christian.
[00:34:43.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   Tell me more."
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:45.080]   Right?
[00:34:45.080 --> 00:34:47.080]   There are plenty of people who serve.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:51.080]   And I've actually gone on missions with people who've fallen away from faith.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:59.080]   So the fact of the matter is, Apostle Paul is always talking in diff conditions because he can't see.
[00:34:59.080 --> 00:35:03.080]   Who is the only one who can examine their own heart?
[00:35:03.080 --> 00:35:04.080]   And that's you.
[00:35:04.080 --> 00:35:10.080]   So by way of application, the objective truth is solid.
[00:35:10.080 --> 00:35:14.080]   It just behooves us to ask, "Is this true of me?"
[00:35:14.080 --> 00:35:19.080]   And even if you're at a strong church, even if you have godly parents, even if you have godly friends,
[00:35:19.080 --> 00:35:22.080]   you still need to examine your own heart.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:28.080]   Is there, in my heart, a wicked, evil pattern of disbelief?
[00:35:28.080 --> 00:35:30.080]   And I'll tell you something.
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:38.080]   This has been, how do you say, as a Christian, a thoroughly sanctified process in my life.
[00:35:38.080 --> 00:35:39.080]   Why?
[00:35:39.080 --> 00:35:45.080]   Because every single person has a private persona and they have a public persona.
[00:35:45.080 --> 00:35:52.080]   And to tell you very truthfully, as a pastor, I am so tempted to always perform a very public persona.
[00:35:52.080 --> 00:35:54.080]   You know what I'm getting at, right?
[00:35:54.080 --> 00:36:01.080]   So you find, I find this existing in all kinds of environments and contexts.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:07.080]   Even amongst the criminals who are like, there's a guy who in a fit of rage murdered people in a shooting
[00:36:07.080 --> 00:36:11.080]   and then the police go interview their neighbors and they're like, "Gah, I thought he was normal."
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.080]   You know?
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:18.080]   But in the deep recesses of his private life, it was so dark and it was dark for way too long.
[00:36:18.080 --> 00:36:20.080]   And it came out in his rage.
[00:36:20.080 --> 00:36:23.080]   And it could be true of Christian servants.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:24.080]   It could be true of teachers.
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:26.080]   It could be true of parents.
[00:36:26.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   It could be true of so many people.
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:36.080]   The reason why I bring that up is because that private persona, nobody knows but you.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.080]   And so you need to examine, in my private life, do I believe?
[00:36:40.080 --> 00:36:42.080]   Do I have a desire for God?
[00:36:42.080 --> 00:36:45.080]   Do I understand God saved me not from loneliness?
[00:36:45.080 --> 00:36:48.080]   God saved me not from, you know, kind of pointless living?
[00:36:48.080 --> 00:36:50.080]   So He gave me a brand new purpose?
[00:36:50.080 --> 00:36:53.080]   No, God saved me from my sins.
[00:36:53.080 --> 00:37:00.080]   I feel the remorse of not knowing my God, but thanks be to the Lord Jesus Christ who brought me to my creator.
[00:37:00.080 --> 00:37:03.080]   Forgave me of my sins.
[00:37:03.080 --> 00:37:10.080]   There is a subjective aspect of Christianity where it has to be your private persona that has now been realized
[00:37:10.080 --> 00:37:14.080]   and it becomes now joined together and it's just one person.
[00:37:14.080 --> 00:37:15.080]   Right?
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:17.080]   That's what needs to happen.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:22.080]   And the Christian individual is always fighting not to put on a front, not to be a hypocrite,
[00:37:22.080 --> 00:37:25.080]   but always be genuine and sincere.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:32.080]   My application of today's passage, when we think about, you know, our experiences, right?
[00:37:32.080 --> 00:37:37.080]   Our experiences in our Christian walk, that really has a strong application for us.
[00:37:37.080 --> 00:37:42.080]   In our persevering, are we examining the private life?
[00:37:42.080 --> 00:37:44.080]   Are we examining our private thoughts?
[00:37:44.080 --> 00:37:51.080]   The desires, longings, imagination and fantasies of your mind that only which you and God knows.
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.080]   That's what we need to tackle, that's what we need to examine daily.
[00:37:55.080 --> 00:37:56.080]   Right?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:37:58.080]   That's what we need to examine daily.
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:05.080]   Now, another application of this is truly what do we say of others?
[00:38:05.080 --> 00:38:07.080]   Right?
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:10.080]   When you see people and you examine their fruits,
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:14.080]   encourage people and challenge people,
[00:38:14.080 --> 00:38:17.080]   not simply to perform X, Y and Z,
[00:38:17.080 --> 00:38:21.080]   or not simply, I think there was a time when,
[00:38:21.080 --> 00:38:27.080]   I don't want to bring up specific names, but this is the best example I have in my mind.
[00:38:27.080 --> 00:38:35.080]   There was a time when, you know, when a church like ours tries to strive for biblical living,
[00:38:35.080 --> 00:38:39.080]   tries to strive for more godliness in your life.
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:45.080]   What ends up happening is, the people who are less mature start making standards that are either unbiblical,
[00:38:45.080 --> 00:38:48.080]   or they try to push for standards that are unrealistic.
[00:38:48.080 --> 00:38:50.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:38:50.080 --> 00:38:53.080]   They either neglect God's standard or they neglect the people.
[00:38:53.080 --> 00:39:00.080]   That's the kind of problem and dilemma that people fall into when you have a group of people who are trying to push,
[00:39:00.080 --> 00:39:02.080]   trying to push towards godliness.
[00:39:02.080 --> 00:39:03.080]   Right?
[00:39:03.080 --> 00:39:04.080]   Okay.
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:09.080]   I think one of the errors that I saw was in trying to ask people,
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   "Are you genuinely saved? Are you that individual who's been examining your heart?"
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:18.080]   You could fall into the danger of setting an arbitrary standard of godliness,
[00:39:18.080 --> 00:39:20.080]   and just really expecting people to live up to that,
[00:39:20.080 --> 00:39:25.080]   and then determining you're not a Christian or you're not genuine.
[00:39:25.080 --> 00:39:29.080]   But what really should mark a genuine Christian, what you should be looking for,
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:32.080]   is not, "Have you met my standard?"
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:37.080]   It should be, "Is your heart showing a pattern of perseverance?"
[00:39:37.080 --> 00:39:40.080]   This idea of, "The Christian will persevere," then says,
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:45.080]   "Even if somebody is really immature, even if someone you're kind of like, 'Gosh!'"
[00:39:45.080 --> 00:39:47.080]   You know, you're not thinking straight or whatnot,
[00:39:47.080 --> 00:39:53.080]   but if they show a pattern of growth, if they show over longevity a pattern of desire,
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.080]   if they show this sense of like, "Yeah, I'm not going to quit, even though I've fallen and all,
[00:39:57.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   like, I can't quit because of my God," that's what you want to see, isn't it?
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   When we're talking about this idea of perseverance of the saints, that's what you want to see.
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:11.080]   So whether an individual started off as they've been living pagan lives for like the past 30 years,
[00:40:11.080 --> 00:40:14.080]   and you expect them to be up here, that's just unrealistic.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:17.080]   You're not really thinking about the person.
[00:40:17.080 --> 00:40:22.080]   But what you need to be examining is the heart of perseverance.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   However, we see a guy who's been Christian for 30 years.
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:29.080]   They've been living their lives in the church, and they kind of have this like,
[00:40:29.080 --> 00:40:32.080]   "Eh, this is what I'm going to be. I don't need to really grow."
[00:40:32.080 --> 00:40:35.080]   You've already seen then elements.
[00:40:35.080 --> 00:40:38.080]   You've already seen then stains of this disbelief. Why?
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.080]   Because they're not growing. They're not persevering.
[00:40:40.080 --> 00:40:46.080]   They're not being changed from one aspect and one increment of glory to another.
[00:40:46.080 --> 00:40:52.080]   They're not being transformed into the likeness of Christ, which is the purpose of our God in salvation.
[00:40:52.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   And so, again, when you address people, if they haven't met your standard of speech, theology, or sanctified living, don't judge them.
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   You need to see their heart condition and whether they're growing or not.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   Whether they have a hunger for the Lord. Does that make sense?
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:16.080]   Yes. I definitely don't want our church by saying, "Yeah, we're Bereans. We want to have right theology and live right."
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:21.080]   And then all of a sudden to like bash people because they haven't lived up to our standard.
[00:41:21.080 --> 00:41:30.080]   Rather, everyone should be given this heart motivation and the condition of their spiritual life when they're hungry for the Lord.
[00:41:30.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   That's key. Amen?
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:38.080]   Alright, any questions? Any questions about perseverance of the saints?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   Okay, let me pray. You guys can go into your small groups.
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:48.080]   Father God, we want to thank you for your grace.
[00:41:48.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   Lord, there have been plenty of times in my life, and I'm sure as we pray together now, in the lives of all the congregation members here,
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:42:02.080]   where we have either lack of motivation, inspiration, or just a strength.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:07.080]   We've all experienced extended period of time, perhaps, where we feel dry.
[00:42:07.080 --> 00:42:13.080]   But we are thankful, Father Lord, that God, for those of us who have been truly saved and redeemed,
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:19.080]   though we might experience times of dryness or experience times where we feel distant from you,
[00:42:19.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   God, because of your great love, because of your faithfulness, because of your strength and your sovereignty,
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:28.080]   we will never be lost.
[00:42:28.080 --> 00:42:35.080]   And I pray, Father God, that that truth would not cause any increment of laziness or apathy,
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   but rather it would motivate us all the more to pursue after you.
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   To see your love and faithfulness, God. Let it inspire us to strive after you with everything that we have.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:50.080]   Father God, I pray that if any single person in here has any doubts of their salvation,
[00:42:50.080 --> 00:42:53.080]   is not sure whether certain things are true for them,
[00:42:53.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   I pray that you give them insight. I pray that you give them great spiritual discernment to examine whether they truly do believe.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:08.080]   And I pray, Father God, that no one here will come to a point where that tragic event,
[00:43:08.080 --> 00:43:12.080]   God, where God would say, "You were so close, but I still don't know you."
[00:43:12.080 --> 00:43:19.080]   But I pray, Father God, that all of us would be able to enter into your presence with great confidence in our Lord Jesus.
[00:43:19.080 --> 00:43:21.080]   And it's in his name we pray. Amen.
