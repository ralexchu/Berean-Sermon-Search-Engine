[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.980]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:02.980 --> 00:00:26.840]   All right.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:27.840]   Finish up your thought.
[00:00:27.840 --> 00:00:28.840]   I'll give you 30 seconds.
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:31.840]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:31.840 --> 00:00:34.840]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.840]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:01:06.200]   All right.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.600]   Can I start us off with prayer?
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:11.600]   [SIDE CONVERSATION]
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:19.440]   Father, we thank you for giving us an opportunity
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.800]   to share and discuss the things that we've gleaned and learned.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.560]   I pray that as we just supplement that
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:28.840]   with a little teaching time, I pray
[00:01:28.840 --> 00:01:32.160]   that you would cause us just a hunger for more.
[00:01:32.160 --> 00:01:35.680]   And so we thank you for this evening, this opportunity
[00:01:35.680 --> 00:01:37.960]   for us to gather together to study.
[00:01:37.960 --> 00:01:42.880]   And we pray just for your spirit to really provide
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:45.960]   for us greater insight.
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:55.480]   So you never want to take a passage just in isolation.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.840]   So if you guys remember from the last several weeks,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:04.720]   what we covered was the elders need to be above approach.
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.720]   And we looked at in the yellow, there are five ways--
[00:02:09.720 --> 00:02:12.080]   these are five negative traits that an elder is not
[00:02:12.080 --> 00:02:14.680]   supposed to be, six positive traits,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:17.600]   and an adverb saying that he will
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:19.840]   be able both to exhort in sound doctrine
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.200]   or refute those who contradict.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:28.440]   So teaching sound doctrine, refuting those who contradict,
[00:02:28.440 --> 00:02:31.120]   that's going to be a very common theme.
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:33.920]   Two ways, offensive, where you have to feed the sheep,
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:36.600]   defensive, where you actually have to fight off the wolves.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.720]   And that's going to come up again several times.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.160]   And we're going to also learn, not just today,
[00:02:42.160 --> 00:02:45.960]   but in chapter three, how do we go about doing these things?
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:49.000]   Because it does say show every consideration, right?
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.200]   How do we silence?
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:52.740]   And those are some of the things that we're going to look at.
[00:02:52.740 --> 00:02:55.880]   But the first thing I do when I take this whole context
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:59.160]   is I break it up in the flow of thought
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.440]   so my eyes can see it easily.
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:07.760]   If you look at the leftmost column, you'll see that.
[00:03:07.760 --> 00:03:10.560]   For there are many rebellious men.
[00:03:10.560 --> 00:03:15.000]   They must be silenced, so reprove them severely.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:18.840]   And you speak the things which are fitting for sound doctrine.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:20.960]   That's what's important.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:25.280]   Do you guys see how I kind of organize it this way?
[00:03:25.280 --> 00:03:30.160]   There are bad people messing up the church inside, right?
[00:03:30.160 --> 00:03:32.160]   They got to be silenced.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:38.560]   So two things-- reprove and speak.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:42.000]   Do you guys see this little couplet again?
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.560]   Exhort and refute.
[00:03:45.560 --> 00:03:49.200]   So refute those who contradict, exhort in sound doctrine.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:51.640]   And when I kind of break it up this way,
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:53.960]   it's easier for me to just track along in my mind
[00:03:53.960 --> 00:03:56.680]   so I don't get lost in the woods.
[00:03:56.680 --> 00:03:58.680]   And the greater context of this chapter
[00:03:58.680 --> 00:04:02.360]   is Titus has a couple tasks that he has to do.
[00:04:02.360 --> 00:04:07.320]   One is to set in order and appoint elders.
[00:04:07.320 --> 00:04:09.600]   If you guys remember that from a few weeks ago,
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:11.800]   he's got a couple things he has to do
[00:04:11.800 --> 00:04:14.360]   is there's a little bit of a chaos.
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:17.120]   He's got to set it in order and appoint elders.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:19.840]   This is a tall task.
[00:04:19.840 --> 00:04:21.560]   Why?
[00:04:21.560 --> 00:04:22.280]   There's chaos.
[00:04:22.280 --> 00:04:25.400]   There are factious men who are upsetting whole families
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:28.240]   and hurting the church.
[00:04:28.240 --> 00:04:31.520]   So and what are these people doing?
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.360]   Titus 3 gives me a little bit more context.
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:37.400]   But avoid foolish controversies and genealogies and strifes
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.600]   and disputes about the law.
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:41.680]   They are unprofitable and worthless.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:44.000]   So it gives you insight into the men of circumcision,
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:45.440]   what they're doing.
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.200]   So it gives you a little bit of insight there.
[00:04:48.200 --> 00:04:53.560]   Reject a factious man after a first and second warning.
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.200]   Knowing that such a man is perverted
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.640]   and is sinning, being self-condemned.
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:00.280]   So these are the kinds of men that are there.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:03.560]   And Titus, in the context of this group of people,
[00:05:03.560 --> 00:05:09.840]   is supposed to set them in order and appoint leadership.
[00:05:09.840 --> 00:05:12.240]   So I'm going to just go through these verses,
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:13.680]   just highlight a few things.
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:16.440]   There are many rebellious men.
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:22.400]   The word rebellious is anupotaktoi.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.120]   So if you guys have studied this before, hypotaso means to
[00:05:25.120 --> 00:05:25.680]   submit.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:26.960]   It's like a military term.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:29.240]   Submit, get an order, the commander says something,
[00:05:29.240 --> 00:05:31.680]   all the soldiers hypotaso.
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:33.120]   This is the opposite of that.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:38.280]   Anupotaktoi, which means they're insubordinate
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:39.640]   to the faithful word.
[00:05:39.640 --> 00:05:44.280]   So these guys refuse to submit to the gospel truths,
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:46.960]   the church, and the apostolic authority.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:49.600]   So they refuse to submit.
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:51.000]   And this is actually also something
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:54.440]   that the elder's children are not supposed to be,
[00:05:54.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   if you guys remember, not accused of rebellion,
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.160]   and dissipation.
[00:05:59.160 --> 00:06:01.360]   So that might give you an insight going backward
[00:06:01.360 --> 00:06:03.280]   a little bit to verse 6.
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:10.320]   Empty talkers, mataiologoi, a logai.
[00:06:10.320 --> 00:06:13.080]   Greek is not my first language, I'm sorry.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:15.040]   And we're taught to read and interpret.
[00:06:15.040 --> 00:06:17.720]   We're not taught to verbally read.
[00:06:17.720 --> 00:06:21.520]   So it really literally means they talk about stuff
[00:06:21.520 --> 00:06:22.800]   that has no meaning.
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:26.320]   Empty, just senseless babbling.
[00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:28.920]   And deceivers, this is the only time this is used
[00:06:28.920 --> 00:06:31.160]   in all the New Testament, this word.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:36.840]   Phrenapatai, phrenapatai, phrenapatai?
[00:06:36.840 --> 00:06:40.680]   Phrenapatai, okay?
[00:06:40.680 --> 00:06:42.480]   So when I do it in the English, it makes it a little harder.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:45.440]   Misleader, conniver, seducer.
[00:06:45.440 --> 00:06:49.160]   Why would such people be so persuasive?
[00:06:49.160 --> 00:06:53.720]   If there's a false prophet who is clearly a false prophet,
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:58.360]   he sucks at being a false prophet, right?
[00:06:58.360 --> 00:07:03.480]   Why are false prophets so effective?
[00:07:03.480 --> 00:07:07.040]   Because most of what they will tell you is truth,
[00:07:07.040 --> 00:07:08.320]   with a slight perversion.
[00:07:08.320 --> 00:07:10.720]   And I always use this for the children's ministry,
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:13.280]   but rat poison, I don't know if this is scientific,
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.840]   but this has been passed down in illustrations
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:20.400]   for many, many years, is 98% of rat poison is food.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.000]   2% is poison.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.520]   With that 2%, what does it do to the rat?
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:25.880]   It kills.
[00:07:25.880 --> 00:07:30.280]   So the false teachers that are among the churches now,
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:32.760]   most of what they will say is true.
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:36.400]   Circumcision, does that sound like something
[00:07:36.400 --> 00:07:37.720]   that comes from the Bible?
[00:07:37.720 --> 00:07:40.880]   Yeah.
[00:07:40.880 --> 00:07:45.480]   Does adhering to the Mosaic law sound like something
[00:07:45.480 --> 00:07:47.080]   that comes from the Bible?
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:49.280]   Yeah, but why is that considered rebellion?
[00:07:49.280 --> 00:07:53.800]   So these false prophets, they're probably
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:57.240]   very gifted people who are very good at lying
[00:07:57.240 --> 00:07:58.840]   and twisting and conniving,
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:00.840]   and they're probably very charismatic.
[00:08:00.840 --> 00:08:07.040]   So be very careful not to be wowed and wooed
[00:08:07.040 --> 00:08:12.100]   by talented speakers, gifted writers, celebrated pastors.
[00:08:13.880 --> 00:08:16.040]   And that's why you need to watch not just their doctrine,
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:16.880]   but their life.
[00:08:16.880 --> 00:08:20.520]   But why do people follow empty talkers?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:22.560]   'Cause they're pretty good at empty talk.
[00:08:22.560 --> 00:08:26.320]   First Timothy says they pray on weak-willed women.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:29.640]   I don't know if you guys did a little cross-reference.
[00:08:29.640 --> 00:08:33.840]   One of the reasons why it's so easy to,
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:37.440]   Christianity has become a gimmick today.
[00:08:37.440 --> 00:08:39.360]   So a lot of people, their Christianity is not coming
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.960]   from the word of God, it's coming from culture.
[00:08:41.960 --> 00:08:44.720]   And so it's easy to kind of manipulate that.
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:45.560]   All right?
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:50.000]   Now, why are these guys so successful?
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:52.200]   I'm gonna read a couple sections of this for you.
[00:08:52.200 --> 00:08:55.160]   Second Timothy three, all who desire to live godly
[00:08:55.160 --> 00:08:57.480]   in Christ Jesus will be persecuted.
[00:08:57.480 --> 00:09:00.120]   But evil men and imposters will proceed from bad to worse,
[00:09:00.120 --> 00:09:01.960]   deceiving and being deceived.
[00:09:01.960 --> 00:09:04.860]   Many false prophets don't know that they're false prophets.
[00:09:04.860 --> 00:09:07.700]   Does that make sense?
[00:09:07.700 --> 00:09:10.400]   Yeah, is it possible for a false prophet
[00:09:10.400 --> 00:09:11.720]   not to know that he's a false prophet?
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:12.600]   Absolutely.
[00:09:12.600 --> 00:09:15.360]   Lord, Lord, did we not perform miracles
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:19.080]   and in your name, like, cast out demons?
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:20.140]   I never knew you, right?
[00:09:20.140 --> 00:09:21.600]   That's Matthew chapter seven.
[00:09:21.600 --> 00:09:22.880]   So they don't know.
[00:09:22.880 --> 00:09:26.200]   Second Timothy four, one through five,
[00:09:26.200 --> 00:09:28.360]   I'm just gonna read the blue part.
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:30.520]   This is why it's important to preach the word.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:32.400]   For the time will come when they will not endure
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.680]   sound doctrine, but wanting to have their ears tickled,
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:36.000]   they will accumulate for themselves,
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.040]   teachers in accordance to their own desires,
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:39.760]   and will turn away their ears from the truth,
[00:09:39.760 --> 00:09:41.520]   and will turn aside to myths.
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:45.180]   People will hear what they wanna hear.
[00:09:45.180 --> 00:09:49.960]   Nod your heads if you understand that.
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:53.660]   People want their ears tickled.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:58.240]   If I err on the side of legalism, give me some rules.
[00:09:58.240 --> 00:10:00.160]   You guys know people like this who are hardworking,
[00:10:00.160 --> 00:10:03.280]   who want to feel like they're very devout.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:05.440]   You give them rules, they'll go crazy.
[00:10:05.440 --> 00:10:07.520]   That's how cults form, right?
[00:10:07.520 --> 00:10:11.240]   People who are in sin, who don't wanna hear it,
[00:10:11.240 --> 00:10:13.560]   they want you to emphasize the forgiveness of God,
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:15.880]   the love of God, the kindness of God, the sweetness of God,
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:17.920]   because they want to know that their sin
[00:10:17.920 --> 00:10:19.840]   is actually not that bad.
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:25.740]   So it's easy to prey on people who want to hear deception.
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:29.120]   So that's kind of the context,
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:32.800]   and the many rebellious men are preying on these things.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:36.480]   So the next three weeks, or the next several sessions,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:40.040]   we're gonna be looking at the rebellious people,
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.060]   and we had to break it up.
[00:10:41.060 --> 00:10:42.200]   Otherwise, you guys are going through
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:43.760]   like seven, eight verses at a time.
[00:10:43.760 --> 00:10:46.000]   So in order to make it more palatable,
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:48.520]   starting chapter two, we're doing five verses each week.
[00:10:48.520 --> 00:10:50.120]   We're breaking this up a little bit.
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.040]   So we're gonna be looking at, today, 10 to 12.
[00:10:54.040 --> 00:10:56.880]   It's gonna continue next week, 13 to 16,
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:10:59.360]   and then it's touched upon on how Titus
[00:10:59.360 --> 00:11:02.120]   is supposed to be different on October 20th.
[00:11:02.120 --> 00:11:04.120]   So I'm not gonna go over all of these today.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.380]   I'll talk about this more next week.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:08.760]   Now, those are the circumcision.
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:09.900]   Who are these guys?
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:11.200]   Okay?
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:15.600]   The Judaizers is what they're usually known as,
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:20.160]   and there's only one reference to the word Judaizer
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:23.000]   in Galatians 2.14, and this is where it comes from.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.700]   When I saw that they were not straightforward
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:25.960]   about the truth of the gospel,
[00:11:25.960 --> 00:11:28.440]   I said to Cephas in the presence of all,
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:30.920]   if you, being a Jew, live like the Gentiles
[00:11:30.920 --> 00:11:34.000]   and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.040]   the Gentiles to eudaizo?
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:41.820]   How do you tell them to live like a Jew?
[00:11:41.820 --> 00:11:44.380]   And this is Paul confronting Peter.
[00:11:44.380 --> 00:11:48.100]   Now, a couple background things that might be helpful.
[00:11:48.100 --> 00:11:50.280]   If you're studying through Genesis,
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:54.580]   you won't get the word Jew until you're almost done
[00:11:54.580 --> 00:11:56.220]   with the Old Testament.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:11:57.340]   Have you guys ever thought about this?
[00:11:57.340 --> 00:11:58.860]   Why are they not the Jews?
[00:11:58.860 --> 00:12:00.620]   Why are they called the Hebrews?
[00:12:00.620 --> 00:12:04.620]   It's because Jew means of Judah.
[00:12:04.640 --> 00:12:09.640]   So 586, when the temple's gone and then they have no land
[00:12:09.640 --> 00:12:13.720]   and the people of God are driven into exile,
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:15.520]   they need to be recognized somehow.
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:18.440]   So the pagan world around them called them of Judah.
[00:12:18.440 --> 00:12:19.680]   You didn't.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:21.720]   So from that point on, they're called the Jews.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:24.100]   So Ezra and Nehemiah, you'll see the word Jews.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:25.960]   Before that, no Jews.
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:29.360]   It'll be either Hebrew, Ephraim, and different words.
[00:12:29.360 --> 00:12:31.280]   Israel, but not Jews, okay?
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:34.380]   So they started getting called Jews after they got exiled.
[00:12:34.380 --> 00:12:37.900]   And early on in church history,
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:41.180]   before the early church was founded,
[00:12:41.180 --> 00:12:45.580]   many Gentiles converted to Judaism, okay?
[00:12:45.580 --> 00:12:48.020]   One of the early deacons was a proselyte.
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:49.660]   He was a convert.
[00:12:49.660 --> 00:12:52.500]   One of the seven original deacons.
[00:12:52.500 --> 00:12:55.580]   He was a convert to Judaism.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.100]   And if you were a Gentile that wanted to become a Jew,
[00:13:00.100 --> 00:13:02.240]   you would have to do three things.
[00:13:02.240 --> 00:13:05.780]   One, you would have to be circumcised if you're a male.
[00:13:05.780 --> 00:13:09.700]   Second, you would have to do a ritual bath cleansing, okay?
[00:13:09.700 --> 00:13:12.800]   And the third, you would have to take the yoke of the law,
[00:13:12.800 --> 00:13:13.640]   it's called.
[00:13:13.640 --> 00:13:15.020]   You have to take the yoke of the law.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:19.120]   There's 613 Mosaic laws
[00:13:19.120 --> 00:13:22.580]   and interpretations of the Mosaic law, okay?
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.020]   It's called the halakha.
[00:13:24.020 --> 00:13:25.800]   That's what I'm supposed to adopt.
[00:13:25.800 --> 00:13:28.160]   I'm supposed to do this.
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:30.040]   Sabbath laws, dietary laws.
[00:13:30.040 --> 00:13:31.720]   So those three things,
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.500]   if I really wanted to follow the Jewish God,
[00:13:34.500 --> 00:13:35.820]   I would have to do that.
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:38.600]   And there was money to be made there, okay?
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:39.520]   Can you imagine?
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:40.960]   Oh, you want me to perform your circumcision?
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:42.600]   $400.
[00:13:42.600 --> 00:13:45.240]   You want me to do your ritual bath cleansing?
[00:13:45.240 --> 00:13:47.360]   I'll give you discount, $300.
[00:13:47.360 --> 00:13:49.360]   And you wanna buy the 613,
[00:13:49.360 --> 00:13:53.520]   this scroll of the Mosaic laws?
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:56.840]   I'll give you even, make all three, even thousand.
[00:13:56.840 --> 00:13:58.840]   So there's sort of gain to be had there
[00:13:58.840 --> 00:14:03.840]   because people want to either be extra religious
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:06.400]   or they want to have free grace.
[00:14:06.400 --> 00:14:09.200]   And those are always two sides of the same coin, okay?
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:12.220]   So Gentiles converted to Judaism,
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:15.520]   early church, for the most part,
[00:14:15.520 --> 00:14:17.720]   all the apostles went to the Jews first.
[00:14:17.720 --> 00:14:19.320]   Do you guys know this?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:21.440]   Okay, in Acts chapter one, it's like,
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:23.000]   go to Jerusalem, then to Judea,
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:24.640]   and then Samaria, and then the ends of the earth.
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:27.280]   Most of the apostles, all their ministry was to the Jews.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:29.560]   Apostle Paul's first decade or so
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.600]   was also ministry to the Jews.
[00:14:31.600 --> 00:14:35.200]   So that's why you had a lot more Jewish Christians
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:40.200]   and culturally Jewish believers in the church, all right?
[00:14:40.200 --> 00:14:43.400]   And there were Cretan Jews at the Pentecost.
[00:14:43.400 --> 00:14:46.160]   And for these groups of people,
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:48.960]   belief in Jesus as a Messiah enhanced,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:51.480]   but did not necessarily replace their Judaism.
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.880]   It's like a hybrid, okay?
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:57.680]   These are the woke folk of the day, all right?
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:01.800]   So the important question that they had was,
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:04.040]   must a Gentile first become a Jew
[00:15:04.040 --> 00:15:05.580]   in order to be a Christian?
[00:15:05.580 --> 00:15:12.560]   And the answer for the Judaizer is yes.
[00:15:12.560 --> 00:15:17.040]   That's who they are, okay?
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.000]   The Judaizer would answer that question,
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.360]   must a Gentile first become a Jew
[00:15:23.360 --> 00:15:28.360]   or some derivative of that in order to become a Christian?
[00:15:28.360 --> 00:15:32.440]   Yes, and that was a circumcision party, okay?
[00:15:32.440 --> 00:15:36.000]   And a lot of the Pharisees who converted to Christianity
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:38.420]   were in this, and you see that whole episode
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.000]   in Acts chapter 15, all right?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.400]   And because there was a large group
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.380]   of this circumcision party,
[00:15:47.380 --> 00:15:51.420]   they started persecuting Gentile Christians.
[00:15:51.420 --> 00:15:53.580]   And that's why you see the book of Hebrews
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:56.820]   trying to encourage them in their being persecuted
[00:15:56.820 --> 00:16:01.620]   to don't go back to the traditions of old.
[00:16:01.620 --> 00:16:03.580]   Hold on to the gospel, okay?
[00:16:03.580 --> 00:16:07.500]   And this is such a big problem in the New Testament
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:09.640]   that 2 Corinthians 11, all of Galatians,
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:11.180]   Philippians three, Colossians two,
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:14.820]   all the pastoral epistles, Hebrews, they all address this.
[00:16:14.820 --> 00:16:19.820]   And so what these Judaizers in Crete taught, I don't know.
[00:16:19.820 --> 00:16:22.860]   It's hard to know exactly, okay?
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.200]   But they were teaching things
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.180]   that were upsetting entire households or churches,
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:29.420]   depending on how you look at that,
[00:16:29.420 --> 00:16:32.620]   with things that they shouldn't teach for the sake of what?
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:37.160]   Sorted gain, because there's money to be made, okay?
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:42.500]   So that's, hopefully that gives you a little bit of insight.
[00:16:42.500 --> 00:16:46.520]   Many rebellious men, how do we silence them?
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:48.340]   And we had a good question in our group,
[00:16:48.340 --> 00:16:50.560]   are these rebellious men only
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:53.100]   that we're supposed to pay attention in our church,
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:54.660]   or are we supposed to call out
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.740]   false prophets all over the world?
[00:16:56.740 --> 00:16:57.880]   And now we can kind of do that, right?
[00:16:57.880 --> 00:17:00.780]   I can Facebook comment on some dude in Zimbabwe
[00:17:00.780 --> 00:17:03.260]   and be like, hey, you preaching health and wealth.
[00:17:03.260 --> 00:17:04.460]   Bad prophet, right?
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:06.060]   Like, I could do that now.
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:07.840]   Is that my job?
[00:17:07.840 --> 00:17:11.980]   To correct all of Christendom with sound doctrine,
[00:17:11.980 --> 00:17:13.080]   or my church?
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:15.460]   How do we silence them?
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:19.300]   Do we silence them, like getting into a Facebook wall war?
[00:17:19.300 --> 00:17:21.060]   Have you guys seen those before?
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:24.300]   Oh yeah, oh, yeah, new ones, blah, blah, blah.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:27.460]   It's just, it's unproductive.
[00:17:27.460 --> 00:17:29.620]   That's why I don't engage in that,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:32.420]   'cause no one's ever been won over on Facebook.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.620]   People just get angry, right?
[00:17:35.620 --> 00:17:39.300]   So you can kind of think, how do we silence these men?
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:40.340]   Little puberty.
[00:17:40.340 --> 00:17:43.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:43.700 --> 00:17:46.700]   So first, verse 13 is what we're gonna look at next week.
[00:17:46.700 --> 00:17:48.620]   Reproving them severely.
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:50.340]   And you're gonna be a little bit emotionally
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:52.140]   and spiritually constipated here
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:53.340]   when you're looking at this passage.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.860]   Okay, reprove them severely.
[00:17:54.860 --> 00:17:56.420]   But later in chapter three, it'll be like,
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:17:58.880]   showing all consideration.
[00:17:58.880 --> 00:18:01.460]   Gentle.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:03.140]   So, ugh.
[00:18:03.140 --> 00:18:04.480]   I know how to, some of you are like,
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:06.300]   dude, I know how to confront.
[00:18:06.300 --> 00:18:08.020]   My theme verse is Proverbs 27, five.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:09.700]   Better is open rebuke than hidden love, right?
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:10.980]   I got this.
[00:18:10.980 --> 00:18:11.820]   But then I'm supposed to do that
[00:18:11.820 --> 00:18:14.220]   with consideration and grace and love?
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:15.500]   Right, so then it gets stuck.
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:17.240]   How do we silence these guys?
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:20.300]   Titus is told to speak the things
[00:18:20.300 --> 00:18:21.820]   which are fitting for sound doctrine,
[00:18:21.820 --> 00:18:24.260]   and raise up an army of people who will do this.
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.780]   Do you see why he's telling him to get elders?
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:30.900]   Raise up an army of folks whose life and doctrine
[00:18:30.900 --> 00:18:32.540]   will correct these buffoons.
[00:18:32.540 --> 00:18:34.540]   That's what he's saying.
[00:18:34.540 --> 00:18:36.500]   And actions that speak loudly
[00:18:36.500 --> 00:18:38.460]   of the power of the gospel of Christ.
[00:18:38.460 --> 00:18:42.500]   Let women, older women, younger women,
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.780]   older men, younger men, bond slaves,
[00:18:44.780 --> 00:18:47.980]   all of you guys, live in such a way
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:49.860]   where you cosmetic, cosmeo,
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:53.320]   adorn the doctrine of God, to silence these guys.
[00:18:53.320 --> 00:18:57.140]   So that's how we're gonna look into that in chapter two.
[00:18:57.140 --> 00:19:00.220]   In chapter three, verses eight and nine,
[00:19:00.220 --> 00:19:02.540]   you'll see that we're supposed to avoid
[00:19:02.540 --> 00:19:04.480]   foolish controversies and genealogies
[00:19:04.480 --> 00:19:05.860]   and strife and disputes about the law,
[00:19:05.860 --> 00:19:08.180]   because these are unprofitable and worthless.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.580]   So when I'm combating a false teacher,
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:17.580]   is my first go-to weapon, like loud,
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:20.660]   like fire with fire, equal footing,
[00:19:20.660 --> 00:19:23.060]   like bashing him for being so spiritually stupid,
[00:19:23.060 --> 00:19:25.660]   is that my role, is that how I combat it?
[00:19:25.660 --> 00:19:27.580]   Titus seems to suggest no.
[00:19:27.580 --> 00:19:30.180]   But how do I reprove them severely?
[00:19:30.180 --> 00:19:34.000]   Now that's a question that I need to ask, okay?
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:38.260]   So, and then the bottom part, for the sake of sordid gain,
[00:19:38.260 --> 00:19:42.860]   and ultimately it's those who love the church
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:44.560]   versus those who use the church.
[00:19:44.560 --> 00:19:48.200]   There are teachers who teach
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:49.600]   because they love the kingdom of God,
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.420]   they love the souls in the church,
[00:19:51.420 --> 00:19:53.260]   and then there are teachers who will teach
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:57.300]   because it makes them profit in one way or the other.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.700]   And the sad thing is, from a distance,
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:03.060]   they look exactly the same.
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:06.540]   So actually when I do counseling to,
[00:20:06.540 --> 00:20:09.020]   it's usually for girls who are thinking,
[00:20:09.020 --> 00:20:10.500]   is this the right man for me?
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.800]   And if they're not dating,
[00:20:13.800 --> 00:20:15.640]   I'm a little bit more free to give this advice,
[00:20:15.640 --> 00:20:17.220]   'cause once they're dating, it's a little harder,
[00:20:17.220 --> 00:20:19.820]   'cause I don't wanna influence them too much
[00:20:19.820 --> 00:20:22.740]   in a reckless way.
[00:20:22.740 --> 00:20:25.180]   But before they start dating, I say, look,
[00:20:25.180 --> 00:20:27.580]   you need to find a man who loves the Lord.
[00:20:27.580 --> 00:20:31.620]   But if you find a guy who just loves the church
[00:20:31.620 --> 00:20:33.640]   without loving the Lord, then you're in trouble,
[00:20:33.640 --> 00:20:35.260]   because the guy who loves the Lord,
[00:20:35.260 --> 00:20:36.980]   five years from now, 10 years from now,
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:38.460]   will be more humble, will be more gracious,
[00:20:38.460 --> 00:20:40.820]   will be more Christ-like, but the guy who loves the church
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:43.460]   will be a grumbler, complainer, all the way through,
[00:20:43.460 --> 00:20:46.580]   and then you're gonna be attached, so be careful.
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:48.940]   Those who are fond of sordid gain
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:52.820]   are those who want to leech off of the church,
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:55.900]   and that's what you're supposed to avoid, okay?
[00:20:55.900 --> 00:20:58.860]   And that's why elders and leaders
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.280]   should be those not fond of sordid gain.
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.280]   All right, so that's something that we see.
[00:21:05.280 --> 00:21:10.760]   Verse 12, one of themselves, a prophet of their own,
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:12.360]   said, "Cretans are always liars,
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.080]   "evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
[00:21:14.080 --> 00:21:16.360]   And some of you guys have already done your research.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:20.600]   This is Epimenides of Knossos, okay?
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:24.000]   I don't know if it's Knossos, probably not.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:28.680]   Epimenides of Knossos, a philosopher of the sixth century,
[00:21:28.680 --> 00:21:31.560]   native of Crete, one of the seven great wise men of Greece,
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:34.600]   and the funny thing that he actually once said was,
[00:21:34.600 --> 00:21:36.980]   "The absence of wild beasts on the island
[00:21:36.980 --> 00:21:39.080]   "is supplied by its human inhabitants."
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:42.540]   So there are no wild beasts on this island, okay?
[00:21:42.540 --> 00:21:45.020]   But the people make up for that.
[00:21:45.020 --> 00:21:48.100]   And then in this context, long time ago,
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   they used to use the word kretizo to mean lie, to cheat.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:57.660]   So that's why it was a pretty bad city,
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:21:59.460]   where it's just a culture of lying, okay?
[00:21:59.460 --> 00:22:01.260]   I just thought that was interesting.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:05.640]   Now, you guys might have skimmed over verse 12, all right?
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.000]   "Always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons."
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.940]   And as I'm trying to do my inductive study,
[00:22:11.940 --> 00:22:15.820]   and as I have the framework of all 46 verses in my head,
[00:22:15.820 --> 00:22:17.580]   I actually noticed something.
[00:22:17.580 --> 00:22:22.580]   Hey, everything that Titus is supposed to exhort
[00:22:22.580 --> 00:22:27.660]   amongst all the Christians in these churches of Crete
[00:22:27.660 --> 00:22:32.160]   go against lying, evil beasts, and lazy gluttons.
[00:22:32.160 --> 00:22:34.740]   You guys see this?
[00:22:34.740 --> 00:22:39.180]   Christians should not be liars.
[00:22:39.180 --> 00:22:41.320]   Instead, they should be dignified, teaching what is good,
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.040]   purity in doctrine, sound in speech.
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:46.980]   Evil beasts, self, no control?
[00:22:46.980 --> 00:22:48.700]   No, they need to be temperate, teaching what is good,
[00:22:48.700 --> 00:22:53.580]   reverent, sensible, sensible, sensible, sensible, sensible.
[00:22:53.580 --> 00:22:56.420]   Example of good deeds, not pilfering, showing good faith.
[00:22:57.420 --> 00:22:59.900]   And then lazy gluttons, no.
[00:22:59.900 --> 00:23:02.180]   Christians should be the hardest of workers.
[00:23:02.180 --> 00:23:04.580]   Dignified, sound in perseverance, not enslaved to wine
[00:23:04.580 --> 00:23:09.380]   because when you're addicted to Netflix or video games
[00:23:09.380 --> 00:23:12.560]   or alcohol or other things, you end up procrastinating
[00:23:12.560 --> 00:23:13.900]   the stuff that you're supposed to do.
[00:23:13.900 --> 00:23:16.940]   You work hard at play and you play at your work.
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:19.340]   No for the Christian, right?
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:22.340]   Not enslaved, working and building up homes.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:24.800]   So that should give you insight into chapter two, verse five.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:27.180]   Women, workers at home.
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:28.700]   Do you think the point is that they can't work
[00:23:28.700 --> 00:23:29.540]   outside the home?
[00:23:29.540 --> 00:23:33.260]   Or do you think the point really is,
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:36.620]   outside or at home, they need to work hard
[00:23:36.620 --> 00:23:41.480]   instead of being like lazy princesses, okay?
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.320]   Be subject and well-pleasing, hipotaso,
[00:23:46.320 --> 00:23:51.500]   versus the other one, rebellious, right?
[00:23:51.500 --> 00:23:55.280]   Be subject and well-pleasing, not argumentative.
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   So are you guys following the logic here?
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.880]   Why does Paul quote a pagan, Cretan writer?
[00:24:05.880 --> 00:24:11.240]   Because he's saying the Christians
[00:24:11.240 --> 00:24:13.840]   in this pagan, Christian area
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:16.480]   need to be very starkly different
[00:24:16.480 --> 00:24:20.260]   so that the saying, Cretans are always liars,
[00:24:20.260 --> 00:24:21.800]   is actually refuted by the lives
[00:24:21.800 --> 00:24:23.920]   of the Christians that are there.
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:25.640]   You guys get that?
[00:24:25.640 --> 00:24:28.160]   So the next week, we're gonna be looking
[00:24:28.160 --> 00:24:30.160]   at the rest of this section.
[00:24:30.160 --> 00:24:31.120]   So kinda keep that in mind.
[00:24:31.120 --> 00:24:33.200]   Next week is a little harder
[00:24:33.200 --> 00:24:36.840]   because it almost seems like there's hope for the prophet.
[00:24:36.840 --> 00:24:38.800]   If I rebuke a false prophet,
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:40.240]   okay, I'm not gonna name anybody,
[00:24:40.240 --> 00:24:43.800]   but let's say I rebuke a health and wealth gospel guy,
[00:24:43.800 --> 00:24:47.160]   maybe I can win him over, right?
[00:24:48.020 --> 00:24:50.480]   That's what it seems like, okay?
[00:24:50.480 --> 00:24:52.760]   And then what's the, to the pure, all things are pure.
[00:24:52.760 --> 00:24:53.800]   What is that?
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:57.040]   So next week, you're gonna have to dig in a little bit.
[00:24:57.040 --> 00:24:57.860]   All right?
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:24:59.040]   And the passage actually, for me,
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:00.800]   ends in chapter two, verse one,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.640]   but we're gonna just do up to the end of chapter one.
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:04.960]   Here's some application questions
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:08.780]   that you guys can discuss.
[00:25:08.780 --> 00:25:09.880]   What are the best ways for you
[00:25:09.880 --> 00:25:12.080]   to combat unsound teachers and teachings?
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:17.360]   I kind of stay away from online battles
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.500]   because I have a lot of, I went to Berkeley,
[00:25:19.500 --> 00:25:21.460]   and I have Berkeley and Stanford friends
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.980]   who are all 20, 25 years removed from college.
[00:25:24.980 --> 00:25:26.360]   A lot of them have a lot of money.
[00:25:26.360 --> 00:25:27.740]   A lot of them are very successful,
[00:25:27.740 --> 00:25:30.820]   and they think they are super wise.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:32.960]   And they've all, and there's a lot of them
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.780]   that are saying all kinds of stuff
[00:25:34.780 --> 00:25:36.260]   about why churches are wrong,
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.860]   why Bible thumpers should, you know,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:40.060]   they're not Christians, and all of these things.
[00:25:40.060 --> 00:25:43.140]   What churches should be for, and all of these things.
[00:25:43.140 --> 00:25:44.720]   And I don't engage.
[00:25:44.720 --> 00:25:45.560]   Why?
[00:25:45.560 --> 00:25:46.700]   It just goes in circles.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:50.480]   So that's a personal conviction.
[00:25:50.480 --> 00:25:53.200]   I don't engage in that kind of a discussion.
[00:25:53.200 --> 00:25:57.940]   So how do I combat a false teacher?
[00:25:57.940 --> 00:25:58.800]   Do I make it public?
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.960]   Do I do it privately?
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:04.120]   And I don't wanna be like,
[00:26:04.120 --> 00:26:05.640]   who are the false teachers in my life?
[00:26:05.640 --> 00:26:07.040]   'Cause that's a little bit more of a dangerous question,
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:09.060]   because it becomes apparent.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:11.520]   But what are the best ways?
[00:26:11.520 --> 00:26:13.500]   And what are the ways that you can better pray
[00:26:13.500 --> 00:26:15.900]   for the spiritual leaders that are in your life?
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:17.760]   All right?
[00:26:17.760 --> 00:26:23.840]   So you don't wanna only use the past 12 verses
[00:26:23.840 --> 00:26:26.320]   to be like, huh, our seven leaders, huh?
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:27.360]   I don't know if they fit this.
[00:26:27.360 --> 00:26:30.280]   Oh, Pastor Peter Chung is pugnacious.
[00:26:30.280 --> 00:26:31.280]   Right?
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:33.420]   Like, that kind of stuff is legitimate.
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.680]   You can hold my feet to the fire and test my character,
[00:26:36.680 --> 00:26:37.880]   test our teaching.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:41.160]   But if you love the leaders at this church,
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:42.840]   what should you do?
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.060]   You need to pray that we are above our approach next year.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:48.940]   We're above our approach the year after.
[00:26:48.940 --> 00:26:52.060]   We're above our approach all the way to the finish line.
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:53.740]   'Cause it's easy to start ministry well.
[00:26:53.740 --> 00:26:55.620]   It's hard to finish well.
[00:26:55.620 --> 00:26:56.640]   Right?
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:59.340]   And we're all getting stretched.
[00:26:59.340 --> 00:27:01.860]   And the first thing that happens when our churches
[00:27:01.860 --> 00:27:03.620]   get stretched and the leaders get stretched
[00:27:03.620 --> 00:27:07.360]   is we start praying less and depending on our own strength.
[00:27:07.360 --> 00:27:09.740]   So those are things you guys can pray for.
[00:27:09.740 --> 00:27:10.580]   Right?
[00:27:10.580 --> 00:27:12.180]   That we're not fond of sordid gain,
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:15.340]   not in terms of money, but maybe it's in terms of renown.
[00:27:15.340 --> 00:27:17.400]   Maybe we need to have a Berean,
[00:27:17.400 --> 00:27:19.840]   like everybody needs to know Berean.
[00:27:19.840 --> 00:27:23.040]   You don't think that temptation's gonna be there?
[00:27:23.040 --> 00:27:23.880]   Right?
[00:27:23.880 --> 00:27:25.540]   And the busier we are, you don't think there's a temptation
[00:27:25.540 --> 00:27:27.700]   to say no to family and yes to church?
[00:27:27.700 --> 00:27:31.820]   So all of those things that are stretching us,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:35.420]   it should help you to pray that we don't become like this.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:40.120]   And also that you guys all become very equipped
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:43.260]   and astute in the word of God so that you can
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:46.020]   take on a lot of discipleship role for new people
[00:27:46.020 --> 00:27:47.660]   in the church and not just pass them off
[00:27:47.660 --> 00:27:48.980]   to the pastors and elders.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.680]   So you guys are seeing how I would apply this passage
[00:27:52.680 --> 00:27:54.660]   if I was a non-pastor.
[00:27:54.660 --> 00:27:55.500]   Right?
[00:27:55.500 --> 00:27:58.420]   One, how do I refute those that are around me
[00:27:58.420 --> 00:27:59.300]   who are negative?
[00:27:59.300 --> 00:28:02.060]   And two, negative as in like they're not teaching
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:02.900]   orthodox stuff.
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:06.300]   And two, how do I pray for the spiritual leaders around me?
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:07.140]   Right?
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:08.320]   How do I pray for Pastor Peter?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.420]   How do I pray for Pastor Mark?
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.900]   How do I pray for Pastor Nate?
[00:28:10.900 --> 00:28:14.460]   How do I pray for the elders who are working full-time jobs
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:16.100]   and doing this on all their free time?
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:17.500]   Like how do I pray for everybody?
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:19.900]   And how do I pray for you to pray for us?
[00:28:19.900 --> 00:28:23.180]   So it becomes just a big, like we really need to be
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:25.180]   above approach, not just in our lifestyle,
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:26.140]   but in what we teach.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:26.980]   Amen?
[00:28:26.980 --> 00:28:28.820]   Amen.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:33.780]   Because our churchianity world is surrounded by
[00:28:33.780 --> 00:28:35.380]   all kinds of strange teaching that's coming
[00:28:35.380 --> 00:28:36.620]   into the churches.
[00:28:36.620 --> 00:28:40.020]   And we need to be alert and aware of how to combat that.
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:44.180]   Not being jerks, but severely reproving in love
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:45.180]   where we need to.
[00:28:45.180 --> 00:28:46.000]   So how do we do that?
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:49.140]   And that requires spiritual wisdom and discernment.
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:50.500]   All right?
[00:28:50.500 --> 00:28:52.820]   I'm gonna leave the rest of the time for you guys
[00:28:52.820 --> 00:28:54.900]   to just discuss this.
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.720]   Oh, that's for next week's homework.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:58.740]   The application is this.
[00:28:58.740 --> 00:29:00.900]   Next week's homework is pretty much exactly the same.
[00:29:00.900 --> 00:29:02.740]   I just changed number one and the date.
[00:29:02.740 --> 00:29:03.580]   Okay?
[00:29:03.580 --> 00:29:06.460]   Wednesday 10/6 and Titus 1/13 to 16.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:08.960]   Everything else, exactly the same.
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:10.820]   So maybe you guys can take some time to pray
[00:29:10.820 --> 00:29:12.460]   for the leadership, pray for each other.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:15.340]   And if you have specific areas where you need wisdom,
[00:29:15.340 --> 00:29:16.920]   maybe now's the time to ask.
[00:29:16.920 --> 00:29:17.760]   Okay?
[00:29:17.760 --> 00:29:18.580]   All right.
[00:29:18.580 --> 00:29:21.420]   (papers rustling)
[00:29:21.420 --> 00:29:24.260]   (papers rustling)
[00:29:24.260 --> 00:29:34.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
