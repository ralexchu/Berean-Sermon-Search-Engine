[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   All right, we have two more sessions after this.
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:14.040]   We have this and then next week we're going to finish up the letter.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:17.480]   And if you've already read ahead, basically the division between this week and next week,
[00:00:17.480 --> 00:00:23.840]   I mean, we could have just done it all together, but we divided it because this week is Paul's
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.680]   companions that he's addressing and saying hi and that's fellow workers.
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:33.080]   And then next week he's basically greeting the people who are there in Colossae.
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:39.240]   And then the week after that, we're going to basically summarize or just kind of overview
[00:00:39.240 --> 00:00:40.240]   study.
[00:00:40.240 --> 00:00:45.880]   And then after that, we have a small group leaders, I think dinner fellowship.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:46.920]   And then we have a break.
[00:00:46.920 --> 00:00:50.920]   And during that break, I think the sign up for next Bible study is going to start pretty
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.280]   soon.
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:56.160]   And so when that comes out, please sign up as soon as we can, so we can organize it.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:00:59.440]   But there is a, there's a long break during the summertime.
[00:00:59.440 --> 00:01:03.860]   And during that break, we may have different activities based upon your life stage and
[00:01:03.860 --> 00:01:04.860]   different things.
[00:01:04.860 --> 00:01:08.960]   But as far as a formal Bible study, there's going to be a break during the summertime.
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:11.240]   Okay, so let me pray for us and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:22.920]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your help and guidance.
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:29.080]   Give me strength, Lord God, to be in your word and to disseminate your thoughts and
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:34.440]   that we may have a deeper understanding of who you are and how you have been working.
[00:01:34.440 --> 00:01:40.760]   We ask Lord the study of these different people, fellow workers of Paul that you've placed
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.120]   around him or got to support, to encourage, strengthen, and to run together that you would
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:54.240]   give us insight as to the early church, Paul's ministry, who you are, and ultimately Lord
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:01:56.800]   of your sovereign grace over them.
[00:01:56.800 --> 00:02:02.360]   So we ask for your blessing over this time in Jesus name we pray, Amen.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:10.480]   Alright, so I hope you took some time to study before you came and look through the names.
[00:02:10.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   You know, typically when you're reading through the Bible, when you get to a passage like
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:16.080]   this, it's just kind of flip over, right?
[00:02:16.080 --> 00:02:21.400]   Because you probably don't recognize the majority of them and out of maybe about six or seven
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:26.080]   different names, you might have remembered some of them if you've read the New Testament
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:31.680]   before, maybe Paphroditus and maybe Onesimus, but because you're not familiar with the names,
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:34.140]   you think, well, it's kind of hard, I don't know anything.
[00:02:34.140 --> 00:02:37.520]   And then you could easily just kind of bypass this chapter.
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:41.600]   But if you were there with our study with the book of Romans, when we got to chapter
[00:02:41.600 --> 00:02:47.160]   16, there was so much of the church history stated in the names that are mentioned in
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:48.160]   the book of Romans.
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:49.920]   Remember that, right?
[00:02:49.920 --> 00:02:51.120]   And this is no different.
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:55.600]   When you actually study the names and who these people were and how they were involved
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:01.560]   and how God was using them, it basically gives you a glimpse of the New Testament in a different
[00:03:01.560 --> 00:03:03.040]   light, right?
[00:03:03.040 --> 00:03:04.040]   What God was doing.
[00:03:04.040 --> 00:03:09.680]   And you have a picture of Paul in prison, but when you see these names who are surrounding
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:14.560]   Apostle Paul, you get a completely different view of what's going on, right?
[00:03:14.560 --> 00:03:18.960]   Okay, so we're going to jump right in and then I'm going to give you, I don't know,
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.440]   I'm going to give you a little bit more time to study or take some time with your small
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:24.440]   group.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:26.840]   But again, Colossians 4, 7 through 14.
[00:03:26.840 --> 00:03:30.280]   First of all, what I want to do is just, I'm just going to go down the list of these names.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:31.280]   Okay.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:35.320]   Oh, it's not the beginning.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   Let me start this over because there's a passage that I wanted to look at.
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:55.320]   Not connected to the Wi-Fi.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:04:00.320]   It is connected.
[00:04:00.320 --> 00:04:09.320]   Sorry, let me pull this up.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:13.320]   Forget it.
[00:04:13.320 --> 00:04:19.640]   Okay, well, it's not here.
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.920]   But before I get into that, where is Paul writing this letter?
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:29.000]   Do you remember?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:31.320]   In prison in Rome, right?
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:34.360]   Remember we studied in the Book of Romans?
[00:04:34.360 --> 00:04:38.560]   In the Book of Romans at the tail end, Paul asked for prayer.
[00:04:38.560 --> 00:04:40.880]   Remember what he prayed for at the tail end?
[00:04:40.880 --> 00:04:45.880]   He prayed that he may be fruitful, that he may be safe, that God would save him from
[00:04:45.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   that.
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   He may be able to come to Rome to be able to minister to them in joy.
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.640]   Remember that?
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:54.320]   Anybody remember that when we were studying the Book of Romans?
[00:04:54.320 --> 00:04:59.840]   And so he asked for prayer so that he could get to Rome in safety to be able to minister
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.840]   to them.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.040]   So remember when we were studying, we looked at Paul's ministry journey where I think he
[00:05:06.040 --> 00:05:07.360]   begins...
[00:05:07.360 --> 00:05:11.120]   He goes to Jerusalem, preaches the gospel, and a riot happens, and they come, and they
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:15.800]   basically want to kill him, and the Roman guards come and they protect him.
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:21.080]   So they hated Paul so much that a bunch of men took a vow that they weren't going to
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:27.360]   eat until he got killed, but because of the Roman guards, he was protected the whole time.
[00:05:27.360 --> 00:05:35.640]   But before he comes to Rome, remember he's sitting in Palestine for two years because
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:39.400]   the governor was hoping that Paul would give him a bribe.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.960]   Do you remember that?
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:47.920]   So he stays in two years under the guard of the Roman guards, and the brothers in Jerusalem
[00:05:47.920 --> 00:05:53.400]   are able to come to him and fellowship with them, reconnect with them the whole time,
[00:05:53.400 --> 00:05:54.880]   while being protected by the guard.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:06:00.560]   And then finally, the trial begins, and then he begins his journey to Rome as a prisoner,
[00:06:00.560 --> 00:06:05.280]   completely under guard of the Roman soldiers.
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:09.080]   While he is on the way, he gets shipwrecked, and during that shipwreck, he gets bitten
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.720]   by a scorpion and he doesn't die.
[00:06:12.720 --> 00:06:16.880]   And they looked like they were going to die, but Apostle Paul gets a vision from Christ
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:19.880]   and saying you're not going to die, and so the whole ship gets saved.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:24.080]   So by the time they go to Rome, Paul is a celebrity.
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:25.080]   Remember that?
[00:06:25.080 --> 00:06:27.080]   He comes to Rome and everybody's, who is this guy?
[00:06:27.080 --> 00:06:31.320]   He gets bitten by scorpions and we were going to die, but his God saved us.
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:36.280]   And by the time he gets to Rome, there's a stir about what's happening to him.
[00:06:36.280 --> 00:06:38.880]   And so as a result of that, what happens?
[00:06:38.880 --> 00:06:40.160]   He gets to rent the house.
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.360]   He's still a Roman prisoner, but under the protection of the Roman guards, he spends
[00:06:46.360 --> 00:06:53.080]   two plus years there having the Roman, the Jews, because they heard about him, coming
[00:06:53.080 --> 00:06:56.200]   to him asking, "Who are you?
[00:06:56.200 --> 00:06:58.000]   What is this gospel that you're preaching?"
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.280]   So during the two years that he's in prison in Rome, under the protection of the Roman
[00:07:02.280 --> 00:07:06.560]   guards, he's freely able to do ministry.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:15.920]   And so while he is in Rome, he writes Philemon, Colossians, Philippians, and Ephesians.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.360]   And not only does he write it, there's a history of the ministry that he's doing.
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.320]   And Onesimus is one of those guys that got converted while he was in Rome.
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:27.160]   So we're going to go over that.
[00:07:27.160 --> 00:07:31.880]   So this is one of the letters that he writes under imprisonment.
[00:07:31.880 --> 00:07:36.880]   So everything that he prayed for at the end of the Book of Romans is fulfilled, and this
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:39.280]   is one of the books.
[00:07:39.280 --> 00:07:40.280]   Just to give you the context.
[00:07:40.280 --> 00:07:50.680]   So Tychicus, he's a carrier, right, of the letter to the Colossians.
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:54.840]   Tychicus is mentioned in Acts chapter 24 as one of the several companions of Paul doing
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:56.800]   ministry in Macedonia.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:07:58.160]   So he was the carrier.
[00:07:58.160 --> 00:08:03.480]   In fact, Tychicus is mentioned in two or three other epistles where he's the carrier.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:06.360]   So it seems like that was his job, right?
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.280]   Maybe he was a skinny guy who liked to run.
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.760]   I don't know what his gift was, but it seemed like he was a designated guy who carried different
[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:14.760]   letters.
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:20.800]   So he's mentioned there, and again, he's the one who brought the letter to the Ephesians
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:24.800]   church.
[00:08:24.800 --> 00:08:31.680]   And there's a, in Ephesians chapter 6, 21 to 22, Paul describes Tychicus almost identically
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:34.360]   to what he says in this passage.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:37.360]   The beloved brother and faithful minister in the Lord will make everything known to
[00:08:37.360 --> 00:08:38.360]   you.
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:41.520]   I have sent him to you for this very purpose so that you may know about us and that he
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:42.960]   may comfort your heart.
[00:08:42.960 --> 00:08:47.480]   So those are the two letters that we have, and he has an identical description of Tychicus,
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:53.000]   but I have a feeling that this was a cut and pasting that Paul did whenever Tychicus went
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   somewhere.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   Right?
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.560]   I know he didn't have a computer then, but it seemed like, because it's identical what
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:00.580]   he says, almost exact.
[00:09:00.580 --> 00:09:05.480]   And so he's known to be the carrier of letters, and so that was part of his duty.
[00:09:05.480 --> 00:09:09.080]   And that's why, again, Apostle Paul, though he was sitting in prison, part of the reason
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:13.320]   why he was able to do what he was doing is because of guys like Tychicus, who devoted
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.440]   himself, went to Paul, "Do you have a task for me?
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:19.200]   Take this to Ephesus."
[00:09:19.200 --> 00:09:23.240]   He would run there, give the report, come back, "What else do you have?"
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:24.240]   Right?
[00:09:24.240 --> 00:09:25.800]   "Well, take this to Ephesus."
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.480]   And then he would take that and go to Ephesus or Colossae.
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:31.160]   So that was this guy, Tychicus.
[00:09:31.160 --> 00:09:33.040]   Onesimus, right?
[00:09:33.040 --> 00:09:34.880]   You've heard his name before.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:38.760]   There's a whole letter written because of this guy.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:44.000]   He was a runaway slave that met Paul in prison and converted to Christianity.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:51.920]   So he's a guy, I don't know how he ran into Paul in Rome, so if he was a slave in Colossae,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.120]   he probably went to Rome because that's a place to go if you're going to be runaway
[00:09:55.120 --> 00:09:58.480]   and you don't have a job and you want to make money.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:09:59.480]   Right?
[00:09:59.480 --> 00:10:05.520]   So if you're a slave in Alabama, you want to run away to make a new life, where would
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:06.520]   you go?
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.360]   To the big city probably, right?
[00:10:08.360 --> 00:10:10.880]   To New York, California, wherever that may be.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:14.560]   And so Rome was the New York of that time.
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:18.920]   So he probably went there as a runaway slave and probably was intrigued, "Who's this guy
[00:10:18.920 --> 00:10:20.400]   that everybody's going to?"
[00:10:20.400 --> 00:10:23.600]   And he has some new message about this Jesus who's resurrected.
[00:10:23.600 --> 00:10:28.920]   Onesimus meets Paul, gets converted.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.440]   His owner Philemon, to which a letter is dedicated to restore him back to the former master as
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:41.040]   a brother in Christ and it says Onesimus is one of them, meaning that this is where he
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:44.040]   ran away from.
[00:10:44.040 --> 00:10:45.820]   So think about that.
[00:10:45.820 --> 00:10:47.480]   Think about what this is.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:56.920]   So Philemon is a letter written to his former master asking to forgive Onesimus for the
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.240]   damage that he's done to restore him back.
[00:11:00.240 --> 00:11:05.520]   So in Colossae, he's one of the carriers of this letter, but he's going back home.
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:07.040]   Right?
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:16.440]   So Onesimus and Tychicus probably had Philemon on them when they came to Colossae.
[00:11:16.440 --> 00:11:22.880]   The way you're looking at me, you have no idea what I just said.
[00:11:22.880 --> 00:11:26.160]   You know the letter Philemon, right?
[00:11:26.160 --> 00:11:30.480]   Most likely this is where he gets reintroduced to his master.
[00:11:30.480 --> 00:11:32.720]   So his name is mentioned kind of in passing.
[00:11:32.720 --> 00:11:36.480]   It doesn't say here that he was a runaway slave, but he probably had that letter with
[00:11:36.480 --> 00:11:37.480]   him.
[00:11:37.480 --> 00:11:41.560]   So think about Onesimus' mindset as he is going to Colossae.
[00:11:41.560 --> 00:11:45.880]   If this doesn't go right, he can get killed.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.000]   And so he said he's one of you, but he's being sent back as a brother, even though he was
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:52.640]   met as a runaway slave.
[00:11:52.640 --> 00:11:53.640]   Right?
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:58.120]   So again, these are things that if you don't pay attention and you don't study this, you're
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:11:59.280]   going to completely miss.
[00:11:59.280 --> 00:12:03.560]   These are powerful things of the New Testament.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:04.560]   Ars Tarchus.
[00:12:04.560 --> 00:12:08.160]   Okay, so those two are people who were the carriers of the letter.
[00:12:08.160 --> 00:12:10.360]   They were the messengers.
[00:12:10.360 --> 00:12:14.040]   He was mentioned as a man from Macedonia, from Thessalonica.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:17.320]   Remember anything about Thessalonica?
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:18.400]   Right?
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:22.300]   That's the city that Paul was at before he goes to Berea.
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:27.000]   In Thessalonica, he was only there for about three, maybe a little bit more than that,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.520]   preached the gospel, but there was a revival that broke out there.
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:34.760]   And because there was a huge revival, there was a persecution that was so intense that
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:37.000]   Paul had to leave.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.380]   So it looks like Ars Tarchus may have been one of those converts there, right?
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:43.320]   In the midst of huge persecution.
[00:12:43.320 --> 00:12:46.960]   He was with Apostle Paul when the Ephesian mob seized Paul.
[00:12:46.960 --> 00:12:49.700]   Remember in Acts chapter 19, right?
[00:12:49.700 --> 00:12:56.920]   In Acts chapter 19, the mob was like so intense that they basically dragged people out on
[00:12:56.920 --> 00:12:58.920]   the street and was beating them.
[00:12:58.920 --> 00:13:03.000]   And it says that Ars Tarchus was with him.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:04.120]   So he was a very close companion.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:07.960]   He's a guy that Paul suffered together with in ministry.
[00:13:07.960 --> 00:13:13.960]   Again, he was mentioned to have been with Paul when he set sail as a prisoner to Rome.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:18.940]   Now this is really interesting because he calls Ars Tarchus a fellow prisoner.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   So he's sitting in Paul.
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.960]   So he was with Paul the whole way, right, in his ministry.
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:28.880]   And then when he gets caught, Ars Tarchus is also in prison, but he also goes to Rome
[00:13:28.880 --> 00:13:29.880]   as a prisoner.
[00:13:29.880 --> 00:13:36.000]   So because of that, Sir William Ramsey, who's known as a world-renowned archaeologist, believes
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.880]   that Ars Tarchus may have made himself a legal slave of Paul to travel along with him in
[00:13:40.880 --> 00:13:43.760]   the missionary journey, right?
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.920]   Because Apostle Paul had special privileges because of his Roman citizenship and his status,
[00:13:48.920 --> 00:13:56.720]   in order to get to places with the same privilege that Apostle Paul had, Ars Tarchus may have
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:14:00.040]   deliberately made himself an indentured servant of Apostle Paul.
[00:14:00.040 --> 00:14:05.160]   And he believes that that's the reason why he's a fellow prisoner of Paul, that he was
[00:14:05.160 --> 00:14:09.600]   with him and then he was caught with him and why he was being dragged along all this time,
[00:14:09.600 --> 00:14:12.960]   because he was probably a very close companion of Apostle Paul.
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.420]   But it had to be more than just a companion, right?
[00:14:16.420 --> 00:14:18.600]   He was somehow tied to Apostle Paul.
[00:14:18.600 --> 00:14:24.160]   So that's why William Ramsey, considering that this was a common practice back then,
[00:14:24.160 --> 00:14:29.160]   that maybe Ars Tarchus did that, that in order for him to commit to this gospel ministry,
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.240]   to come in and out of places that only a Roman citizen could have, that he may have made
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:36.240]   himself...
[00:14:36.240 --> 00:14:41.600]   Again, this is just an educated guess, but it's really interesting that these people
[00:14:41.600 --> 00:14:47.160]   literally gave their lives and literally, possibly, made himself a slave in order for
[00:14:47.160 --> 00:14:50.760]   him to preach the gospel, which is not unheard of.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.240]   That sounds like something crazy in our generation, but remember at that time, people were getting
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:15:01.800]   circumcised and not circumcised and doing crazy things for the gospel, right?
[00:15:01.800 --> 00:15:05.480]   Mark, everybody knows Mark, right?
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:07.200]   John Mark.
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.160]   Mark sometimes called John Mark.
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:12.520]   He was the cousin of Barnabas, the son of encouragement.
[00:15:12.520 --> 00:15:17.600]   Because a long time ago, when we were studying the book of Acts, we did some study on him.
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:20.800]   He seems like he came from a wealthy family, right?
[00:15:20.800 --> 00:15:24.640]   Because Mark's house was where the apostles gathered together.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.560]   And he says many of the disciples gathered together at his house to pray on a regular
[00:15:28.560 --> 00:15:29.760]   basis.
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.440]   It should be 44, 36, 37, okay?
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:37.680]   Not 436.
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:39.320]   There is no 436.
[00:15:39.320 --> 00:15:46.160]   Chapter 4, 36 and 37, and in chapter 12, verse 12, he is mentioned twice in the beginning.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:49.200]   And again, he is the cousin of Barnabas.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:53.220]   Some think that he might have been his nephew, but Barnabas is the one in the early church
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:57.680]   where he sells his possessions and gives half of it to the church, right?
[00:15:57.680 --> 00:16:03.640]   So Barnabas, Mark, that family seems like a very wealthy family.
[00:16:03.640 --> 00:16:07.320]   So it wasn't like just the poor people who had nothing to lose that attached themselves
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:08.660]   to Apostle Paul.
[00:16:08.660 --> 00:16:10.280]   People were very wealthy.
[00:16:10.280 --> 00:16:14.440]   They got convicted and they gave everything, literally their lives, right?
[00:16:14.440 --> 00:16:19.920]   So this idea that the gospel began to spread in the rural areas where people were hungry,
[00:16:19.920 --> 00:16:24.600]   they were poor, they were prisoners and slaves, and that's why they were so bold, because
[00:16:24.600 --> 00:16:29.380]   they had nothing to lose, does not fit the biblical narrative.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:34.120]   Because people from all walks of life, once they met the resurrected Christ and they were
[00:16:34.120 --> 00:16:36.800]   convicted, they gave everything to follow Christ.
[00:16:36.800 --> 00:16:39.840]   And Mark was one of them.
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.040]   If you remember the story of Mark, Mark accompanied Apostle Paul and Barnabas in his first missionary
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.040]   journey.
[00:16:47.040 --> 00:16:53.580]   But when they encountered intense persecution, Mark basically took off and ran, right?
[00:16:53.580 --> 00:16:57.480]   And so they don't see him again until they come back and they're ready to go back to
[00:16:57.480 --> 00:17:02.040]   the second round, but Mark comes back and Barnabas wants to bring him again.
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:03.040]   Remember that?
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:07.280]   So Barnabas and Apostle Paul had a complete different take on what to do, and basically
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:14.600]   Barnabas, you know, he's the son of encouragement, but it also makes sense if that was his cousin,
[00:17:14.600 --> 00:17:15.600]   right?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:18.400]   And maybe his nephew, maybe.
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:21.400]   His sister would kill him if he didn't take him, maybe.
[00:17:21.400 --> 00:17:24.920]   There's something going beyond that, because they're family, right?
[00:17:24.920 --> 00:17:28.880]   And so because of this sharp disagreement, and you can understand Apostle Paul.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:30.520]   It's not that he was just a sharp man.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:32.860]   I mean, he's literally risking his life.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:38.280]   He got stoned, dragged out to the city, walking back in, and he's risking his life to spread
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.180]   the gospel, and we can't have somebody on the team that we can't rely on.
[00:17:42.180 --> 00:17:45.720]   Get stoned, and then I get dragged out, and Mark's gone.
[00:17:45.720 --> 00:17:47.920]   So how can we rely on this guy, right?
[00:17:47.920 --> 00:17:56.200]   And so they ended up splitting, but later on, Mark becomes a very important disciple.
[00:17:56.200 --> 00:18:04.220]   In fact, Peter calls him his son in the faith, and that possibly Mark came to faith because
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:11.380]   of Peter's preaching, and he became the Timothy for Peter, as Timothy was to Paul, right?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:12.380]   So he was the messenger.
[00:18:12.380 --> 00:18:17.420]   He was the right-hand man, and so we know that Mark is also the author of the gospel
[00:18:17.420 --> 00:18:18.420]   of Mark.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:23.580]   This is the same guy that at one point, early on in his faith, that Apostle Paul just wrote
[00:18:23.580 --> 00:18:25.380]   him off, right?
[00:18:25.380 --> 00:18:27.780]   Thankfully so, right?
[00:18:27.780 --> 00:18:32.660]   Because on his first missionary journey, he literally was stoned to death and got back
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:36.020]   up and went back into the city, right?
[00:18:36.020 --> 00:18:40.140]   He was that guy, but later on, the Apostle Paul says, "Mark is very useful to me," and
[00:18:40.140 --> 00:18:44.220]   now he's one of Paul's companions, right?
[00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:49.620]   So just the people who are surrounding him, if you see what's going on and who is around
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:56.860]   him doing the work, is a powerful testimony of the gospel.
[00:18:56.860 --> 00:19:05.180]   I mean, anyway, you can imagine Paul being resentful of Mark for taking off, but now
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:11.100]   they're working together, and Paul introduces Mark, right, as a faithful brother.
[00:19:11.100 --> 00:19:14.100]   So that's Mark.
[00:19:14.100 --> 00:19:21.100]   Okay, Justice.
[00:19:21.100 --> 00:19:28.100]   Where am I?
[00:19:28.100 --> 00:19:30.940]   Okay, Justice.
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:38.820]   And Justice's name basically is Jesus, right?
[00:19:38.820 --> 00:19:47.540]   So Justice, his name is Jesus, but you know what's interesting is if you think that the
[00:19:47.540 --> 00:19:51.860]   Son of God was going to come, even though he's humble, you would think he would have
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.340]   at least a different name.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:20:01.980]   You would think he would be like, I don't know, Roman, something that's, "Oh, that sounds
[00:20:01.980 --> 00:20:04.340]   like a name of the Messiah."
[00:20:04.340 --> 00:20:10.260]   But he came like everybody else, John, Peter, Alex, just like anybody else.
[00:20:10.260 --> 00:20:16.500]   So his name Jesus, like obviously people don't use that name unless you're Spanish, right?
[00:20:16.500 --> 00:20:18.500]   They have Jesus.
[00:20:18.500 --> 00:20:22.140]   But outside of that, typically we don't use that name because of the significance of that
[00:20:22.140 --> 00:20:23.140]   name.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:25.460]   But at that time, Jesus was a very common human name.
[00:20:25.460 --> 00:20:27.380]   It was nothing spectacular.
[00:20:27.380 --> 00:20:29.580]   It was a very ordinary name.
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:33.140]   So even in his name, Jesus was like everybody else, right?
[00:20:33.140 --> 00:20:36.740]   And again, we don't know a whole lot about him.
[00:20:36.740 --> 00:20:40.860]   And all we know is that Paul says that he was a big encouragement to him while he was
[00:20:40.860 --> 00:20:41.860]   in prison.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:46.080]   So while he was in prison, he was being ministered to, right?
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:47.080]   He was not alone.
[00:20:47.080 --> 00:20:51.540]   He had a lot of companions who were coming and going over there and ministering to him
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:55.500]   in his first imprisonment, right?
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:01.580]   We're not there, but later on when he is in prison writing 2 Timothy, the story is very
[00:21:01.580 --> 00:21:02.580]   different.
[00:21:02.580 --> 00:21:05.900]   This is his first time in prison.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:12.060]   And it's almost like it's exciting because Paul's in prison, but he's not that bad, right?
[00:21:12.060 --> 00:21:14.260]   Because he's God answered prayer.
[00:21:14.260 --> 00:21:15.500]   He's being guarded.
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:18.180]   He's probably eating what he wants.
[00:21:18.180 --> 00:21:21.940]   The Jewish leaders are actually coming to him and he's sitting at home preaching the
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:24.820]   gospel and he's doing this for two years.
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:29.900]   So you can imagine the Christians at that time thinking like, "Man, Paul's in prison,
[00:21:29.900 --> 00:21:32.820]   look at the way God's protected him."
[00:21:32.820 --> 00:21:37.860]   But by the time he's in prison, the third time and then he gets executed in 2 Timothy,
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:39.500]   the story's very different.
[00:21:39.500 --> 00:21:43.260]   You remember 2 Timothy says, "They've all left.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:45.500]   Nobody's here with me."
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:47.740]   Because that time it looked like he was going to...
[00:21:47.740 --> 00:21:54.140]   That was a real imprisonment that most prisoners experience and then eventually he got beheaded
[00:21:54.140 --> 00:21:55.960]   after he wrote 2 Timothy.
[00:21:55.960 --> 00:21:59.360]   So the attitude was very different.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:07.780]   But this time as he is in Rome, he has a lot of people coming to him ministering to him.
[00:22:07.780 --> 00:22:16.020]   Now if you see under his name, Paul emphasizes that these are the men who are of the circumcision
[00:22:16.020 --> 00:22:17.020]   group.
[00:22:17.020 --> 00:22:23.000]   And again, this is just conjecture from Adam Clark and he says that the circumcision group
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.720]   simply was to point out that these are the only ones who are left of the circumcision
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:27.720]   group.
[00:22:27.720 --> 00:22:28.720]   Possibly.
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:31.900]   But he's not just identifying, "These are the Jews and these are the Gentiles."
[00:22:31.900 --> 00:22:38.700]   That he may be identifying that by this time, the circumcision group is starting to wane.
[00:22:38.700 --> 00:22:45.520]   In other words, the Jews who were supportive, eventually they were starting to get divided.
[00:22:45.520 --> 00:22:48.620]   The Judaizers and then the true gospel.
[00:22:48.620 --> 00:22:55.420]   Again, this is just educated guess, but Adam Clark believes that possibly that's the reason
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.860]   that he's identifying and separating the Jews on his team and the non-Jews for that reason.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.900]   Epaphras.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:08.860]   From here are the list of Gentiles.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:11.140]   He calls them the bond servants of Christ.
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:17.300]   And again, this is a phrase that Paul often uses, an indentioned servant, literally a
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:19.340]   slave.
[00:23:19.340 --> 00:23:23.140]   He's a co-slave of Christ.
[00:23:23.140 --> 00:23:25.580]   His ministry is highlighted as being earnest in prayer.
[00:23:25.580 --> 00:23:31.300]   So I'm sure they all pray, but when Epaphras is mentioned, Epaphras says, "Always laboring
[00:23:31.300 --> 00:23:37.060]   earnestly for you in his prayer, that you may stand perfect and fully assured in all
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:38.060]   the will of God.
[00:23:38.060 --> 00:23:42.820]   For I testify for him that he has deep concern for you, for those who are in the Odyssean
[00:23:42.820 --> 00:23:43.820]   Hierapolis."
[00:23:43.820 --> 00:23:50.340]   Part of the reason why maybe Epaphras was a fervent prayer warrior for them is because
[00:23:50.340 --> 00:23:52.860]   he was from there.
[00:23:52.860 --> 00:23:55.300]   He loved these people.
[00:23:55.300 --> 00:23:59.060]   And typically our prayers are more powerful when we're praying for people that we love,
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:01.620]   that we care about.
[00:24:01.620 --> 00:24:07.500]   When we're praying for things that we're indifferent for, I mean, we pray like it's a chore, but
[00:24:07.500 --> 00:24:10.220]   you don't pray earnestly.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:15.940]   Everybody prays earnestly if somebody that you love gets sick.
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.700]   And so that's the thing that when we pray, to pray for things that God has placed in
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.060]   your heart and pray fervently.
[00:24:22.060 --> 00:24:25.460]   So again, Epaphras is known as a prayer warrior.
[00:24:25.460 --> 00:24:30.620]   Epaphras is another brother from Colossae who deeply loved them and those of Laodicea
[00:24:30.620 --> 00:24:33.020]   and Hierapolis.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:37.940]   Luke, the physician.
[00:24:37.940 --> 00:24:43.260]   Luke is the author of the Gospel of Luke and what other book?
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:45.340]   Acts.
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:47.780]   Okay.
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:50.940]   Tell me if I'm wrong.
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:25:01.620]   Are the two letters, Luke and Acts, put together longer than all of Paul's letters put together?
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:03.300]   One of the passages.
[00:25:03.300 --> 00:25:06.500]   I remember reading that, but I'm not 100% sure.
[00:25:06.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   No?
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:08.500]   Pastor Peter?
[00:25:08.500 --> 00:25:12.260]   Think of all the chapters, put it together.
[00:25:12.260 --> 00:25:15.420]   Think of all the chapters of the epistles.
[00:25:15.420 --> 00:25:19.380]   If it's not number one, it's number two.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.860]   So either Luke's writing, the most writings in the New Testament is from Luke or he's
[00:25:24.860 --> 00:25:25.860]   number two.
[00:25:25.860 --> 00:25:30.340]   In other words, Luke is a very significant figure in the New Testament.
[00:25:30.340 --> 00:25:35.540]   So God used this man who was a physician who probably was detail-oriented as a physician
[00:25:35.540 --> 00:25:40.360]   and took detailed records of what happened in Jesus' life.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.920]   And there's more mention of Jesus' humanity in the book of Luke than any other gospel.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.140]   And then he was very meticulous to record the early church.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:50.140]   What happened?
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:51.900]   Who, how did it spread?
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:52.900]   Where did it go?
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.900]   Who took it where?
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.020]   Paul's missionary journey, when did he do it?
[00:25:56.020 --> 00:25:58.380]   I mean, he was meticulous.
[00:25:58.380 --> 00:26:02.580]   And so Luke, God used Luke, the physician, to do that.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:06.820]   He was a physician who was traveling companion of Apostle Paul.
[00:26:06.820 --> 00:26:14.100]   My guess is that Luke probably was their personal physician.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:18.380]   A lot of times people kind of describe the early church as magical things happening all
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   the time.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:22.980]   When somebody falls sick, you know, Paul lays hands and they rise up and, you know, like
[00:26:22.980 --> 00:26:24.700]   that was just an everyday occurrence.
[00:26:24.700 --> 00:26:27.020]   And that's not what we see in the New Testament.
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:30.540]   Because Paul says to Timothy, what?
[00:26:30.540 --> 00:26:33.260]   To drink some wine to take care of his stomach problems.
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:39.460]   I mean, that sounds like a, you know, that sounds like a very ineffective way of dealing
[00:26:39.460 --> 00:26:43.300]   if he could, he just laid hand and made him well, right?
[00:26:43.300 --> 00:26:47.900]   There were spectacular things that did happen as a sign that they were apostles, but that
[00:26:47.900 --> 00:26:51.580]   was not the day-to-day life, right?
[00:26:51.580 --> 00:26:54.500]   So probably God gave Luke as a physician.
[00:26:54.500 --> 00:26:59.620]   So you can imagine all those people traveling and then Paul sitting in prison, he gets sick,
[00:26:59.620 --> 00:27:00.940]   right?
[00:27:00.940 --> 00:27:03.300]   Physician Luke is right there to support them.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:09.220]   Finally, Demas, not a lot of mention, not a lot is mentioned about Demas.
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:11.140]   He just says, and also Demas.
[00:27:11.140 --> 00:27:15.860]   Where does Demas come out in the New Testament?
[00:27:15.860 --> 00:27:17.420]   In 2 Timothy, right?
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.140]   Remember I mentioned by the time Paul writes 2 Timothy, the mood is very different.
[00:27:23.140 --> 00:27:26.860]   Demas is mentioned as a companion of Paul.
[00:27:26.860 --> 00:27:29.620]   Again he's in Philemon 1.24.
[00:27:29.620 --> 00:27:34.220]   But in 2 Timothy 4.10, Paul points out that Demas had forsaken him, having loved this
[00:27:34.220 --> 00:27:37.300]   present world and that he had gone on to Thessalonica.
[00:27:37.300 --> 00:27:39.420]   So he was abandoning him, right?
[00:27:39.420 --> 00:27:44.300]   So Paul lists a bunch of names in the front and a bunch of names in the back that was
[00:27:44.300 --> 00:27:48.540]   abandoning him and the reason why he's writing the letter to Timothy is saying, "Make sure
[00:27:48.540 --> 00:27:50.620]   this doesn't happen to you."
[00:27:50.620 --> 00:27:54.420]   And so 2 Timothy 2.2, when he says, "These things you have heard from me in the presence
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:59.260]   of many witnesses, entrust the faithful men who will be able to teach others."
[00:27:59.260 --> 00:28:01.900]   He's not just telling Timothy a general rule.
[00:28:01.900 --> 00:28:08.300]   He's telling this because a lot of people that he's invested in have backslidden.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:11.460]   So he's telling Timothy, "Make sure that you invest in the right people."
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:12.460]   Right?
[00:28:12.460 --> 00:28:17.900]   So he was, again, he was just like a pastor like anybody else.
[00:28:17.900 --> 00:28:22.540]   He spent a lot of time ministering, discipling, shepherding and there are certain people who
[00:28:22.540 --> 00:28:27.540]   are just kind of dropping out and he's warning his disciple Timothy, "Make sure it doesn't
[00:28:27.540 --> 00:28:31.820]   happen to you, but make sure that when you invest, invest in the right people."
[00:28:31.820 --> 00:28:33.920]   And that's what 2 Timothy 2.2 is coming from.
[00:28:33.920 --> 00:28:37.100]   So Demas was one of these guys who abandoned him.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:42.380]   Now we're going to get to the second part next week.
[00:28:42.380 --> 00:28:46.780]   And I've just kind of given you the surface overview of who these people were in the background.
[00:28:46.780 --> 00:28:53.060]   I don't know about you, but every single one of these names, it highlights what was happening
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:28:54.660]   in the early church.
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:55.660]   Right?
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.940]   I mean, it's one thing to see the gospel.
[00:28:57.940 --> 00:29:02.900]   It's like, well, the gospel is this and the gospel establishes this and gospel has done
[00:29:02.900 --> 00:29:03.900]   that.
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:07.780]   But the reason why our personal testimony is so powerful in the gospel is because it
[00:29:07.780 --> 00:29:13.180]   gives the flesh, that it's not just a presentation of facts that you believe.
[00:29:13.180 --> 00:29:14.180]   Right?
[00:29:14.180 --> 00:29:18.620]   So when we present the gospel, the most powerful way to present the gospel is to present your
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:24.700]   testimony when you present the gospel, because it gives the reality of what the gospel is
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:25.980]   capable of doing.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.460]   And that's what these names are.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:34.180]   That this is how God is working in the early church through these people.
[00:29:34.180 --> 00:29:40.620]   And even though they're not giving their testimony, we see what was happening in the early church.
[00:29:40.620 --> 00:29:42.300]   Right?
[00:29:42.300 --> 00:29:43.460]   Okay.
[00:29:43.460 --> 00:29:56.900]   So for the questions, I don't have the questions up here, but if you look on the bottom, what
[00:29:56.900 --> 00:30:01.340]   are some observations you can make from the list of these names?
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:05.260]   So again, instead of me telling you, I'm going to ask you guys in your group, maybe you've
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:06.820]   already done some of that.
[00:30:06.820 --> 00:30:07.820]   Right?
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:11.940]   And again, about Paul's ministry, what does this tell you or some insight into Paul's
[00:30:11.940 --> 00:30:13.500]   ministry?
[00:30:13.500 --> 00:30:17.840]   What insight do you get from about the gospel through these names?
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:19.340]   About God himself?
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:20.340]   Right?
[00:30:20.340 --> 00:30:23.340]   What does it teach you about the early church?
[00:30:23.340 --> 00:30:24.980]   I mean, there's a lot in here.
[00:30:24.980 --> 00:30:25.980]   Right?
[00:30:25.980 --> 00:30:30.660]   I mean, you have a runaway slave being restored back to his master.
[00:30:30.660 --> 00:30:32.580]   You know, Jews and Gentiles in the same place.
[00:30:32.580 --> 00:30:38.060]   So what are some other things that you notice about the early church through that?
[00:30:38.060 --> 00:30:43.620]   B. Esther actually asked me this question, and I thought that was a very good question.
[00:30:43.620 --> 00:30:47.380]   If you were in prison, who would you call to come and minister to you outside of your
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:48.820]   immediate family?
[00:30:48.820 --> 00:30:49.820]   Right?
[00:30:49.820 --> 00:30:52.540]   She asked me that, I think, this morning.
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:54.180]   So I said, "Oh, that's a good question.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:56.660]   I'll put that in."
[00:30:56.660 --> 00:31:01.300]   So if you were in prison, and again, outside of your immediate family, so you can't say
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:06.820]   your wife or your children or your dad or mom or uncle, brother, outside of your immediate
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.780]   family, who would you call?
[00:31:09.780 --> 00:31:18.140]   And then, C, if someone was in prison, who would call you to come and minister to them?
[00:31:18.140 --> 00:31:19.860]   Right?
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:22.620]   Who is titch-a-kiss to you?
[00:31:22.620 --> 00:31:28.340]   Who is Onesimus, Aristarchus, Mark, Justice, right?
[00:31:28.340 --> 00:31:31.820]   Epaphras, Luke, Demas even.
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:34.460]   Who are they?
[00:31:34.460 --> 00:31:37.300]   Are you any of these people to somebody?
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:39.660]   Outside of your immediate family.
[00:31:39.660 --> 00:31:44.100]   Who would call you to come to them because they need your encouragement, and you're the
[00:31:44.100 --> 00:31:46.420]   person that they would call?
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:51.020]   And then, D, how do you think the people you are doing ministry together with would describe
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:53.980]   you if they wrote a letter like this?
[00:31:53.980 --> 00:31:54.980]   Right?
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:32:04.660]   And I know that you guys are probably going to be like typical Asians and say, "Oh, no,
[00:32:04.660 --> 00:32:07.580]   you know, they're going to think I'm lazy, I'm this and that."
[00:32:07.580 --> 00:32:09.820]   And it's like, be honest.
[00:32:09.820 --> 00:32:11.980]   I'm not saying boast.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:16.060]   I'm not saying like, this is what I think they're going to write.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:21.060]   Write an honest description if they were to describe you.
[00:32:21.060 --> 00:32:25.020]   If Paul was to describe you, right?
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:31.260]   If Paul was to describe you to somebody, and I'm not, again, I know this is tricky, right?
[00:32:31.260 --> 00:32:34.220]   Because you know why.
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:35.220]   Okay?
[00:32:35.220 --> 00:32:39.340]   This is tricky, but it takes some time to think about it.
[00:32:39.340 --> 00:32:43.740]   If Paul, if you were a companion of Paul, how would he describe you?
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:44.740]   Okay?
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   Yeah.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:48.580]   I'm going to leave it up to you to figure that out.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:54.780]   But I hope that you guys can be mature enough not to simply say nothing.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:56.420]   Right?
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.740]   Not to simply say nothing, but to really think like, "Oh, you know, I try."
[00:32:59.740 --> 00:33:02.740]   Even though you may not be there, it's like, "I try to be this.
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:03.740]   I try.
[00:33:03.740 --> 00:33:08.100]   I may not be perfect and maybe I'm failing, but this is something that's really important."
[00:33:08.100 --> 00:33:11.060]   Like, I'm titchicus, right?
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:15.540]   I have people at this church, and even in this room, who has told me, "I'm a horse.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:17.580]   They want me to work."
[00:33:17.580 --> 00:33:18.580]   Meaning that they're servants.
[00:33:18.580 --> 00:33:19.580]   Right?
[00:33:19.580 --> 00:33:24.620]   "I can't lead, and I'm not good at this, I'm not good at that, but I can work, physical
[00:33:24.620 --> 00:33:25.620]   labor."
[00:33:25.620 --> 00:33:27.700]   So, it's like titchicus.
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.140]   Where do you want me to go with this letter?
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:33.660]   And don't tell me that all of you are titchicus.
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:35.060]   There are some titchicus.
[00:33:35.060 --> 00:33:36.060]   Right?
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:40.500]   So, take some time to pray over that and to discuss that in your small group.
[00:33:40.500 --> 00:33:50.180]   So let me pray for us and then we'll dismiss you to your group.
[00:33:50.180 --> 00:33:54.820]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing over our time, and we ask Lord God that in
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:34:01.180]   our small groups, that even in the small things, help us Lord God to search you, to know your
[00:34:01.180 --> 00:34:04.980]   heart, and that we would draw closer to you as a result.
[00:34:04.980 --> 00:34:06.620]   So I pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:34:06.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:07.620]   Amen.
[00:34:07.620 --> 00:34:09.160]   Amen.
