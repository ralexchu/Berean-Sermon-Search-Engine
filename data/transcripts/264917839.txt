[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.720]   Alright, my intention was to try to cover chapter 11 and 12, but then each time I get
[00:00:10.720 --> 00:00:16.560]   into it, I feel like there's too much to cover both chapters.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.160]   I was kind of debating back and forth whether I'm going to try to finish Leviticus in this
[00:00:20.160 --> 00:00:24.200]   session or to do it in two sessions.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:29.720]   And I, as I was preparing, especially this week, I realized it's not, I don't think it's
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.720]   going to be beneficial to try to finish it in one session because each chapter, even
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:39.280]   though sometimes we can get lost in it, there's so much depth inside of it and so much of
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:43.000]   it connects us to a deeper understanding of the New Testament.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:48.520]   I don't want to skim through it and I think if you really grasp what's happening in Leviticus,
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.200]   it will really open up the New Testament to you.
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.380]   And so I think it would be beneficial for us to take our time, so we are going to take
[00:00:54.380 --> 00:00:56.040]   it a little bit slower.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:00:59.060]   Not that we've been going fast, but we're going to cover chapter 11.
[00:00:59.060 --> 00:01:03.080]   Chapter 12 is very few verses, but we're going to cover chapter 12 and we're probably going
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:05.560]   to just do one chapter at a time.
[00:01:05.560 --> 00:01:10.240]   And then this session is going to go toward mid-June, mid to second and third week of
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:11.240]   June.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:14.400]   And then there's about a six week, seven week break.
[00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:18.440]   And then we pick up and then we'll finish the second half after that.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440]   Okay.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:20.440]   So that's our schedule.
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:23.120]   All right.
[00:01:23.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   Chapter 11, I'm sure if you took some time to read it, you probably have come into this
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:29.360]   room thoroughly confused.
[00:01:29.360 --> 00:01:33.120]   Like what, how does this benefit and what is the meaning behind it?
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:38.880]   The split hooves and the scales and no scales and what is the meaning behind this?
[00:01:38.880 --> 00:01:39.880]   Okay.
[00:01:39.880 --> 00:01:42.000]   So we'll cover that today.
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.800]   One thing that I was thinking about this week before we even get started about, I preached
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:51.000]   through the book of Leviticus maybe about 14 years ago.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.880]   And I know there's only like a very few people who are here, maybe like two.
[00:01:54.880 --> 00:01:59.760]   Yeah, I can only think of maybe Esther.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:00.760]   Did you come Peter?
[00:02:00.760 --> 00:02:01.760]   You came in the middle.
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:02.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:02.760 --> 00:02:03.760]   Peter came in the middle.
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:04.760]   There's a few.
[00:02:04.760 --> 00:02:05.760]   Yeah.
[00:02:05.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   So maybe four.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:09.320]   Now I'm looking at four or five.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:13.040]   And I remember at that time studying through Leviticus, how difficult it was to study because
[00:02:13.040 --> 00:02:18.080]   there's so little material in the Old Testament, in particular Leviticus and Numbers.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:24.160]   And so I tried going to the library, looking up commentaries and usually even in the commentaries,
[00:02:24.160 --> 00:02:26.880]   they would just kind of cover broad sections at a time.
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:30.160]   So there's so little material.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:36.280]   But this time around, as I was studying, because of the internet, there's so much material
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:39.920]   to cover that I don't have time to read all of it.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:43.200]   And I was just thinking as I was studying through that, just in the period of about
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:48.000]   10 to 12 years, because of the internet, the resource that has been available to all Christians
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   around the world.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.280]   And it just, the only reason why we don't know the Bible is just because we lack the
[00:02:53.280 --> 00:02:54.280]   will.
[00:02:54.280 --> 00:02:58.680]   You know, but the opportunity to be able to dive into even deep things that would have
[00:02:58.680 --> 00:03:03.200]   taken a long time to even grasp or understand, it's just a matter of your curiosity and just
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:04.800]   taking a few minutes to type it in.
[00:03:04.800 --> 00:03:05.800]   It's just right there.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:06.800]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:07.800]   And to sift through all of that.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:14.360]   Now just thinking about that, just how much the landscape has changed and how really privileged
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:15.560]   we are.
[00:03:15.560 --> 00:03:21.280]   But along with that, as we study, the scripture says much is given, much is expected.
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:29.240]   So in God's economy, there's no other group of people in human history that should have
[00:03:29.240 --> 00:03:33.960]   a better grasp of God's word than the people who are living in this generation.
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.600]   Just because of the resources that we have.
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:38.240]   It's just any question you have, you can just type it in.
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:42.080]   You can just ask and it tells you.
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:46.560]   The only reason why we may not know is because we're not curious enough.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.840]   We just don't have the will or we're just too distracted.
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:55.080]   But definitely no Christian in our generation should ever be able to say, "I couldn't grow
[00:03:55.080 --> 00:03:57.760]   because," or, "I couldn't mature.
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:59.440]   I didn't know because."
[00:03:59.440 --> 00:04:00.840]   Because we already have it.
[00:04:00.840 --> 00:04:04.240]   Anyway, I was just thinking about that, just feeling blessed to be able to have all these
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   resources.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:07.240]   Let me pray for us and then we'll jump in.
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:12.720]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing.
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:19.360]   I thank you for my brothers and sisters who many of us have come from long day of work.
[00:04:19.360 --> 00:04:25.280]   I pray that in the midst of physical fatigue, that our spirits may be renewed and that even
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:30.680]   our physical strength, Lord God, may be restored, Father God, as a result of meeting you and
[00:04:30.680 --> 00:04:32.440]   knowing who you are.
[00:04:32.440 --> 00:04:36.960]   We pray that you would bless this time and that your grace would truly be sufficient
[00:04:36.960 --> 00:04:38.040]   for all things.
[00:04:38.040 --> 00:04:42.880]   Help us to understand the deep things that you have implanted in these verses, Lord,
[00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:46.880]   that the New Testament and the gospel message may open up to us, that we may have a better
[00:04:46.880 --> 00:04:52.840]   grasp of what you've been doing in history and how we got here and your detailed plans,
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:57.400]   Lord God, and your blueprints, that all of these things would make better sense to us.
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:04:58.400]   So we thank you, Father.
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:04:59.400]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:04:59.400 --> 00:05:00.400]   Amen.
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:06.280]   If you look at your outline or if you look at the sheets that I've given you, on the
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:09.960]   top of it I put the phrase, "Cleanliness is next to godliness."
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:13.900]   I thought that was kind of interesting because when I typed that in or I was looking at that,
[00:05:13.900 --> 00:05:18.840]   he said that at least in the modern era, modern era meaning the last two, three hundred years,
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:25.080]   okay, that's what I mean by modern era, the first record that we have of this phrase was
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:28.120]   given by John Wesley in a sermon.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:31.280]   The context of it wasn't about this passage.
[00:05:31.280 --> 00:05:35.000]   It was basically John Wesley teaching about discipleship and how we need to be disciplined
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   and all that.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.520]   So that's interesting because at least the phrase itself, it relates to the text that
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:42.240]   we're looking at this morning.
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:44.440]   Godliness or cleanliness is next to godliness.
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:48.800]   The whole thing that we're going to be looking at, chapter one all the way to chapter 11
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:06:00.840]   all the way to 15, is about how God distinguishes what is clean and unclean.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:04.320]   So this is just a quick review of the outline.
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.400]   What do you call that kind of outline?
[00:06:06.400 --> 00:06:08.360]   Okay, chiastic.
[00:06:08.360 --> 00:06:11.160]   And what makes it a chiastic outline?
[00:06:11.160 --> 00:06:13.560]   Right, just that order.
[00:06:13.560 --> 00:06:17.880]   So you have it starts the first half of it up to chapter 16, you have the laws, laws
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:22.380]   of priest, laws of purity, and then the center of it is the day of atonement, right?
[00:06:22.380 --> 00:06:27.040]   So if someone was to read this, you know that the day of atonement is the kind of main point
[00:06:27.040 --> 00:06:32.480]   so everything points to the day of atonement and everything points from the day of atonement.
[00:06:32.480 --> 00:06:38.200]   What does that kind of look like in God's economy?
[00:06:38.200 --> 00:06:40.360]   The cross, right?
[00:06:40.360 --> 00:06:44.440]   Everything is preparation toward the cross and everything after that is pointing back
[00:06:44.440 --> 00:06:46.200]   to the cross, right?
[00:06:46.200 --> 00:06:48.560]   So that's a chiastic format.
[00:06:48.560 --> 00:06:53.240]   We're kind of in chapter 11 through 15, the different laws of purity and all of these
[00:06:53.240 --> 00:06:56.160]   things are going to lead us to the day of atonement, right?
[00:06:56.160 --> 00:07:00.480]   The reason why the day of atonement needed to take place and then from that it's going
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:06.480]   to go beyond and talk about how to fulfill that in personal lives.
[00:07:06.480 --> 00:07:11.960]   So we're in chapter 11 through 15, the laws of purity.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.800]   So the previous chapter 10, 10 and 11, so if you have your Bibles open just turn there
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:25.320]   real quick, 10 and 11 God says to the priests, you are to distinguish between holy and the
[00:07:25.320 --> 00:07:29.280]   common and between the unclean and the clean and that was the job of the priest.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:33.640]   The priest through God's law were to identify what is acceptable, what is not acceptable
[00:07:33.640 --> 00:07:35.200]   before God.
[00:07:35.200 --> 00:07:42.200]   So chapter 11 through 15 is identifying for us what they are.
[00:07:42.200 --> 00:07:47.840]   So chapter 11 is talking about what is clean and unclean in animals and then chapter 12
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:55.080]   through 15 is unclean and clean pertaining to human beings.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.480]   So if you were to split up chapter 11 through 15 that's how it would be split up.
[00:07:58.480 --> 00:08:02.520]   So starting from next week's chapter 12 we're going to get into specifics of how God views
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:06.480]   clean and unclean as it pertains specifically to human beings.
[00:08:06.480 --> 00:08:14.840]   Today it's going to be about animals.
[00:08:14.840 --> 00:08:21.200]   So the previous chapters deal with the ritual dealings with worship at the tabernacle but
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:27.920]   this passage in particular, chapter 11 through 15 is how these laws should be practiced at
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:28.920]   home.
[00:08:28.920 --> 00:08:33.120]   So up to this point it was all talking about the tabernacle and the priesthood and their
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:39.240]   purification and their washing and their ordination but starting from this point on it's specifically
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:41.360]   talking to individuals.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:44.720]   So these aren't necessarily things that are practiced only in the tabernacle but in their
[00:08:44.720 --> 00:08:46.720]   personal lives.
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:48.920]   So if there's any distinction that's a distinction.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:57.400]   So in chapter 11, 32 separate times the word unclean is used.
[00:08:57.400 --> 00:08:58.680]   The word unclean is used.
[00:08:58.680 --> 00:09:03.040]   So you can already tell just by the repetition of this word that that's the theme.
[00:09:03.040 --> 00:09:09.220]   What is unclean before God's eyes and then it uses the word detestable.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:14.480]   Some of your translations abomination, 11 separate times.
[00:09:14.480 --> 00:09:19.100]   So some things are unclean, some things are abominable, they're detestable before God
[00:09:19.100 --> 00:09:22.180]   and you're not to touch it.
[00:09:22.180 --> 00:09:28.440]   Now these distinctions between clean and unclean animals are not new in Leviticus.
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:32.240]   Remember we talked about that, a lot of the sacrifices, these burnt offerings, remember
[00:09:32.240 --> 00:09:35.360]   we saw it even in the book of Genesis.
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:41.900]   That's most likely the offering that maybe that Cain and Abel or Abel offered.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:45.540]   It seemed like it was a burnt offering that he was given.
[00:09:45.540 --> 00:09:53.200]   So the distinction is a lot of these sacrificial systems and what is considered clean and unclean,
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:10:00.120]   it existed but in chapter in the book of Leviticus it's clarifying it and make it into a law,
[00:10:00.120 --> 00:10:02.120]   a collective law.
[00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:06.860]   I think the best way for us to describe that is when you become a member of the church
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:09.580]   we have a tenfold covenant.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.600]   Now that tenfold covenant is not a new thing for Christians at Berean.
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:17.200]   Berean didn't create that.
[00:10:17.200 --> 00:10:22.040]   The tenfold covenant in what we ask you guys to sign are things that are commanded in the
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:23.040]   New Testament.
[00:10:23.040 --> 00:10:26.980]   That this is what it means to be a member of the body of Christ, this is what it means
[00:10:26.980 --> 00:10:32.020]   to be a follower of Jesus and all we've done is identified ten core things that we want
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:37.340]   to make sure that you understand and we're expecting the Berean community church to practice
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:38.600]   that.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:41.080]   But it was not created by Berean community church.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.660]   It was things that was already in scripture that we just kind of collected it and trying
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.700]   to emphasize it.
[00:10:46.700 --> 00:10:51.140]   So that's I think probably the best way to understand that a lot of these regulations
[00:10:51.140 --> 00:10:55.820]   clean and unclean, we see it before the book of Leviticus.
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:59.580]   Now what they understood, how they understood it, how they applied it, we don't have the
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:00.580]   details.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:05.380]   All we know is that there are passages specifically that mention clean and unclean.
[00:11:05.380 --> 00:11:10.620]   So in Genesis chapter 7, 1 through 10, where God tells Noah to prepare these animals and
[00:11:10.620 --> 00:11:14.780]   he tells them to distinguish between the clean and the unclean.
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:17.980]   So that idea and that concept already existed before the book of Leviticus.
[00:11:17.980 --> 00:11:21.460]   So it wasn't like, you know, they receive the book of Leviticus and all of a sudden
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:22.980]   it's like I don't understand this.
[00:11:22.980 --> 00:11:26.820]   It was already embedded into their culture.
[00:11:26.820 --> 00:11:35.340]   So again, as I mentioned, this distinction was part of an ancient tradition that antedated
[00:11:35.340 --> 00:11:40.420]   the Mosaic law, which is what I've been saying.
[00:11:40.420 --> 00:11:46.820]   The reasons behind these distinctions with clean and unclean animals, there is no universal
[00:11:46.820 --> 00:11:49.700]   agreement in the Christian community.
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:53.500]   And this is part of the reason why there's so much confusion in the book of Leviticus,
[00:11:53.500 --> 00:11:58.060]   because there's nothing, no one thing that clearly says, "Aha, this answers all of our
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:11:59.060]   questions."
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:03.160]   But some of it makes more sense than the other.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:05.100]   These are the four different views.
[00:12:05.100 --> 00:12:06.500]   The arbitrary view.
[00:12:06.500 --> 00:12:11.900]   Maybe you see arbitrary views basically, we throw our hands up, none of this makes sense.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:13.540]   There's no use trying to understand it.
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:14.860]   God said it, we just do it.
[00:12:14.860 --> 00:12:15.860]   Right?
[00:12:15.860 --> 00:12:17.700]   That's the arbitrary.
[00:12:17.700 --> 00:12:18.700]   There's no rule.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:20.780]   There's nothing to look, just read it.
[00:12:20.780 --> 00:12:22.060]   It doesn't apply to you today.
[00:12:22.060 --> 00:12:23.260]   It happened in the past.
[00:12:23.260 --> 00:12:24.260]   Forget about it.
[00:12:24.260 --> 00:12:25.260]   Right?
[00:12:25.260 --> 00:12:26.260]   That's basically the arbitrary rule.
[00:12:26.260 --> 00:12:27.260]   It's completely arbitrary.
[00:12:27.260 --> 00:12:28.820]   There's no meaning behind it.
[00:12:28.820 --> 00:12:33.340]   Obviously, I don't think there's anything that God does that's completely arbitrary.
[00:12:33.340 --> 00:12:40.060]   When I think about that view, it kind of reminds me of tonsils.
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:43.900]   I had my tonsils taken out because the doctor told me to.
[00:12:43.900 --> 00:12:52.140]   And then right now, because I think modern medicine, their underlying backbone is evolution.
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.260]   So their ideology is that we've evolved, that we don't, certain organs that we don't understand,
[00:12:57.260 --> 00:12:58.660]   it just doesn't function anymore.
[00:12:58.660 --> 00:13:01.580]   So it just kind of, if you don't see the reason for it, get rid of it.
[00:13:01.580 --> 00:13:05.980]   But the tonsil was one of those things that they don't really know exactly what it is.
[00:13:05.980 --> 00:13:09.940]   But after I took it out, I started having really bad breathing problems.
[00:13:09.940 --> 00:13:14.300]   Then I asked my dad who had the same issue and he took his lung, his, not lungs, but
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:17.180]   his tonsils out.
[00:13:17.180 --> 00:13:22.340]   And he told me that he had the exact same problem when he took his tonsils out.
[00:13:22.340 --> 00:13:26.780]   So we don't know exactly what it is, but definitely we start having problems with breathing because
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:27.780]   of it.
[00:13:27.780 --> 00:13:30.980]   So it kind of reminds me, the arbitrary view is if we don't understand it, there's no meaning
[00:13:30.980 --> 00:13:32.300]   behind it.
[00:13:32.300 --> 00:13:36.260]   I think that's human arrogance to think that if we don't understand, there's no meaning
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:37.260]   behind it.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:39.500]   I don't think anything God does is random.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   There's a purpose behind it.
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:41.500]   But that's the first view.
[00:13:41.500 --> 00:13:48.580]   The cult, sorry, the cultic view, that this view states that the unclean animals are associated
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.900]   with some pagan worship.
[00:13:50.900 --> 00:13:54.660]   Now no one has identified specifically what those pagan worship is.
[00:13:54.660 --> 00:14:00.460]   There are obviously some, some traces of that in some of the idol worships of the Canaanites,
[00:14:00.460 --> 00:14:04.540]   but it does not cover comprehensively the things that he's saying.
[00:14:04.540 --> 00:14:08.100]   But that's one of the views, that maybe God told them not to touch these animals because
[00:14:08.100 --> 00:14:13.220]   certain animals were sacrificed in idol worship.
[00:14:13.220 --> 00:14:18.540]   But again, there's no evidence behind that because the list that we have in Leviticus,
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:24.260]   there is no religion or nothing that we can identify historically that has any, any list
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:27.820]   that comes even close to that's mentioned in the book, in Leviticus.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:30.780]   But that's again, a theory, right?
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:33.180]   Better than the arbitrary view.
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.660]   The third view you may have heard, because this is a view that is propagated in some
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:38.660]   circles.
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:43.820]   I've heard, I've gotten into deep conversations with Seventh-day Adventists, and they are
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:45.460]   very strict with this.
[00:14:45.460 --> 00:14:51.060]   That there's, we don't understand fully, but there's some modern medical things that some
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:52.980]   of these animals are clearly unclean.
[00:14:52.980 --> 00:14:53.980]   It's not good for you.
[00:14:53.980 --> 00:14:57.800]   They're, they're considered less healthy than the clean animals.
[00:14:57.800 --> 00:15:01.060]   And so some of it we understand, some of it we don't understand.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:08.900]   So I've, I remember speaking to, in particular, I don't, I'm not sure if all Seventh-day Adventists
[00:15:08.900 --> 00:15:13.660]   believe this, but, but many of the Seventh-day Adventists believe that the Old Testament
[00:15:13.660 --> 00:15:18.780]   dietary laws are something that we ought to practice because it has personal benefits,
[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:19.780]   right?
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:23.700]   There's some people in the Christian community who also believe that, right?
[00:15:23.700 --> 00:15:25.140]   I think there is a mixture of that.
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:31.660]   And it clearly, again, when I was back in college, I read an article from a non-Christian
[00:15:31.660 --> 00:15:37.700]   who read all of these, again, not, not having medical background, just reading their conclusion,
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:45.540]   and this is coming from a non-Christian, who was questioning the Mosaic authorship because
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:51.500]   the detailed information about what is unclean and clean was so accurate that Moses could
[00:15:51.500 --> 00:15:54.960]   not have known this information.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:57.380]   And so therefore, he rejected Moses' authorship.
[00:15:57.380 --> 00:15:58.740]   This was a non-Christian talking about this.
[00:15:58.740 --> 00:16:03.060]   I don't know the details of what animals are good for what or why certain animals are not
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.380]   good for eating, but I remember reading an article that that was the conclusion of this
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:08.820]   particular person.
[00:16:08.820 --> 00:16:12.820]   So that's one of the views, that we don't fully understand it, but God told them to
[00:16:12.820 --> 00:16:19.420]   do something because in the long run, it was, it was all, it was healthy for them, okay?
[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:22.700]   I believe that there's probably a lot of that embedded in there because there's nothing
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.860]   that God tells you to do that doesn't ultimately benefit us, right?
[00:16:27.860 --> 00:16:34.780]   The order in the church telling us to submit to government, I mean, there's all kinds of
[00:16:34.780 --> 00:16:35.940]   things that God commands us to do.
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:39.660]   We may not initially understand it, but in the, in the larger scheme of things, what
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:44.260]   God has created in his order that he created for us ultimately is for our benefit, and
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.060]   I believe that this probably is one of those things.
[00:16:47.060 --> 00:16:51.500]   So we may understand some and not understand others, but I definitely believe there is
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.900]   some physical benefits from some of the things that he said.
[00:16:57.900 --> 00:17:05.660]   The most popular view and most wide-held view is the symbolic view, that there's a lot of
[00:17:05.660 --> 00:17:10.860]   symbolism behind them, and it makes sense because a lot of things that God did in the
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:16.420]   other parts of the tabernacle, like laying on of hands, right, to eating at a certain
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:22.780]   place, sacrificing the whole burnt offering, or the peace offering, and having picnics,
[00:17:22.780 --> 00:17:26.460]   all of these things are symbolic, pointing to something very specific that was going
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.520]   to be fulfilled in Christ.
[00:17:28.520 --> 00:17:33.260]   So the symbolic view basically points to that there are symbolisms that are embedded into
[00:17:33.260 --> 00:17:37.820]   these clean and unclean animals that ultimately point to something that would be fulfilled
[00:17:37.820 --> 00:17:38.820]   in Christ.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:43.860]   Again, but the challenge that we have is then what are the symbolisms?
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:50.860]   Some are pretty obvious, and some are obviously up to debate, but that's part of the reason
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:17:57.540]   why we have such a difficult time coming to a final, comprehensive conclusion in this,
[00:17:57.540 --> 00:17:58.540]   because it is not easy.
[00:17:58.540 --> 00:18:00.540]   But it seems to make most sense.
[00:18:00.540 --> 00:18:04.580]   Hermeneutically, it's consistent with the other way that we approach every other part
[00:18:04.580 --> 00:18:10.820]   of Scripture, that hygienically, there probably is a direct benefit, and maybe some of you
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:14.860]   guys would know that better than I do, but definitely symbolically, it was pointing to
[00:18:14.860 --> 00:18:15.860]   something in Christ.
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:21.220]   So that's the way we're going to kind of approach it today, and to see what are some of the
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:22.220]   things.
[00:18:22.220 --> 00:18:29.020]   So to give you an example of that, remember in verse 42, to chapter 11, verse 42, one
[00:18:29.020 --> 00:18:33.900]   of the detestable things that God mentions about these bugs, whatever goes on its belly
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:39.420]   and whatever goes on the fours, or whatever has many feet and swarms, the things that
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:42.820]   swarm on the ground, you shall not eat, for they are detestable.
[00:18:42.820 --> 00:18:48.820]   Okay, again, just symbolically, in Genesis chapter 3, 14 to 15, what happens there that
[00:18:48.820 --> 00:18:51.820]   crawls on the belly?
[00:18:51.820 --> 00:18:52.820]   You should know, right?
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.300]   Satan is judged, and what's one of the judgments?
[00:18:56.300 --> 00:19:00.200]   That you shall crawl on your belly, right?
[00:19:00.200 --> 00:19:04.460]   So again, it doesn't mean that that's exactly what it is, but that's how certain things
[00:19:04.460 --> 00:19:10.120]   are being, that for us to understand it, that in scripture, for whatever the reason, God's
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.660]   judgment led to crawling on the belly.
[00:19:12.660 --> 00:19:18.700]   So it could be that a lot of the symbolism is pointing to certain things, just like yeast
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.260]   represents sin in the scripture, right?
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:27.740]   So whenever he says not to have any sin, not sin, but any yeast in your dough, it represents
[00:19:27.740 --> 00:19:33.140]   to be cleansed, to repent, and to not to have any of that, any kind of defect, in bringing
[00:19:33.140 --> 00:19:35.180]   that to him.
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:39.140]   And so a lot of these things that are being taught in this, if you search deep enough,
[00:19:39.140 --> 00:19:46.060]   there are similarities or symbolisms that are embedded all throughout scripture that
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:48.140]   it causes us to kind of look deeper.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:57.020]   So that's just one example of that.
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:05.140]   The dietary regulations are divided into three major parts, okay?
[00:20:05.140 --> 00:20:14.100]   You have the animals that are living on the land in chapter 11, verse 2 to 8.
[00:20:14.100 --> 00:20:19.020]   The animals that are living on the land are divided into two different sets, clean and
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:20.140]   unclean.
[00:20:20.140 --> 00:20:24.480]   The clean animals are, they need to meet two requirements.
[00:20:24.480 --> 00:20:29.580]   They need to be animals that chew the cut and have a split hoof, okay?
[00:20:29.580 --> 00:20:34.540]   So what's an example of an animal that chews the cut and has split hoof?
[00:20:34.540 --> 00:20:40.960]   Cow, goat, lamb, right?
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:47.980]   And a lot of it are the animals that God chose for sacrifice, right?
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:51.100]   And then the ones that you can, and it has to have both.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.520]   You can't have one and not the other, okay?
[00:20:54.520 --> 00:20:59.260]   So you can qualify as one, you can chew the cut, but if it has split hooves, it wouldn't
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:01.780]   qualify, right?
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:05.940]   What's an animal that would be an unclean animal?
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:07.340]   Huh?
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:12.500]   Rabbit, because it chews the cut but doesn't have split hooves, right?
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:17.540]   How about a lion?
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:19.140]   It wouldn't qualify for either.
[00:21:19.740 --> 00:21:21.660]   Okay, so you get it, right?
[00:21:21.660 --> 00:21:23.420]   So that's how it's distinguished.
[00:21:23.420 --> 00:21:27.860]   So in order for it to be considered clean, you have to chew the cut, meaning it basically
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:31.820]   has to be a vegetarian, right?
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:37.180]   And then it has to have split hooves, so it has to fit that category, okay?
[00:21:37.180 --> 00:21:40.380]   So I'm not going to go into detail and say, "Well, you know, what about a lion?"
[00:21:40.380 --> 00:21:41.980]   And we're not going to go into that.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:45.940]   We're going to just try to cover it in a larger scale, just try to figure out the meaning
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:47.180]   behind a lot of it.
[00:21:47.180 --> 00:21:54.780]   The second category are the sea creatures, verses 9 through 12.
[00:21:54.780 --> 00:22:00.900]   In order for it to be considered clean, they have to have fins and scales, right?
[00:22:00.900 --> 00:22:01.900]   Fins and scale.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:05.860]   You can't have one and not the other.
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:13.500]   So a lot of the sea creatures that wouldn't fit this category would be what?
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:17.060]   Huh?
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:26.940]   Eels, crab, lobster.
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:27.940]   You can't have that.
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:32.460]   You're going to sin against God if you have lobster again, right?
[00:22:32.460 --> 00:22:35.740]   So it needs to have fins and scales.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:42.020]   So if you love seafood and you love lobster and crabs, shame on you, right?
[00:22:42.020 --> 00:22:45.860]   But there's good news at the end, so hold on, okay?
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:49.380]   So that would be the second category.
[00:22:49.380 --> 00:22:54.380]   Third are all the creatures in the air, and specifically it's prohibited.
[00:22:54.380 --> 00:22:58.180]   Birds of prey would be defiled by dead carcasses.
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:02.760]   Birds of prey would be considered unclean, right?
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:08.600]   Any birds that are scavengers, right?
[00:23:08.600 --> 00:23:12.100]   So what would fall into this category?
[00:23:12.100 --> 00:23:14.260]   Huh?
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.460]   Eagles, crows.
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:23.580]   Okay, those are the only two I know, but I'm sure you can think of more, right?
[00:23:23.580 --> 00:23:26.420]   Any birds of prey would be considered unclean.
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.940]   Chicken, turkey, all that would be okay, okay?
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:33.300]   And then within the flying, there are insects.
[00:23:33.300 --> 00:23:38.100]   And within the insects, the only provision that is given that you can eat is jointed
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:47.780]   hind legs, which would be locusts, grasshopper, crickets, but all other insects are considered
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:49.460]   detestable.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:23:55.660]   So if you remember John the Baptist, his main diet was locusts and honey, because it was
[00:23:55.660 --> 00:23:59.900]   clean, it was considered clean.
[00:23:59.900 --> 00:24:09.860]   All cockroaches, flies, and insects are rejected as unclean, right?
[00:24:09.860 --> 00:24:13.520]   So we're all grossed out by it because the Bible says it's unclean.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.100]   So there's biblical reasons to hate spiders, right?
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:24.820]   So we're going through it pretty quick.
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:29.140]   So that's the first part of it where it talks about the animals that are clean and unclean,
[00:24:29.140 --> 00:24:30.140]   right?
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:32.900]   And there are, like, the symbolism behind it.
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:33.900]   Let me give you...
[00:24:33.900 --> 00:24:38.060]   Now, again, I'm not going to go through, like, this is the symbolism behind this and the
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.780]   split hooves, and we're going to talk about that.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.540]   But one of the theories of the symbolic views is that all the animals that are mentioned
[00:24:44.540 --> 00:24:51.420]   that chew the clut and split hooves are considered natural and normal, okay?
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:57.580]   And this is propagated by a man named Douglas, and he basically says that all the animals
[00:24:57.580 --> 00:25:03.900]   and the sea creatures and the birds that are mentioned that maybe God had intended for
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:08.540]   a certain way, but they don't function the way they're supposed to, whatever they mean.
[00:25:08.540 --> 00:25:12.540]   Again, so when I read it, to me, it wasn't airtight.
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:16.940]   But this is, again, this is just my theory, my guess.
[00:25:16.940 --> 00:25:24.100]   If we were to look at the Old Testament commandment of the regulations on the sacrifices and the
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   priests, what is the primary thing that it says that you cannot bring to God?
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:37.700]   What was the word that was used over and over again that you cannot bring to God?
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:39.660]   Any kind of blemish of any kind.
[00:25:39.660 --> 00:25:42.660]   It has to be an animal without defect.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:45.220]   And same thing with the priest, right?
[00:25:45.220 --> 00:25:49.900]   And then you can't have yeast, and the reason why you can't have yeast is what?
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:55.100]   It alters the dough, right?
[00:25:55.100 --> 00:26:00.220]   Basically it's introducing something foreign, and then the bacteria causes the whatever
[00:26:00.220 --> 00:26:01.220]   it is.
[00:26:01.220 --> 00:26:04.300]   I don't bake, but basically for it to change its nature.
[00:26:04.300 --> 00:26:11.140]   So anything that defiles the original intention, right, whatever it may be, what he said is
[00:26:11.140 --> 00:26:13.060]   defected before God.
[00:26:13.060 --> 00:26:20.380]   So it's not identify how these animals are defected, but again, one of the theory is
[00:26:20.380 --> 00:26:27.020]   that God's intent in creation, that the clean are the ones that God originally intended,
[00:26:27.020 --> 00:26:33.180]   and then the unclean are the things that eventually maybe through, I don't know, some kind of
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:35.340]   defilement went another direction.
[00:26:35.340 --> 00:26:37.460]   Again, this is just a theory.
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:41.780]   But whatever it was, those things that he identifies were considered defective.
[00:26:41.780 --> 00:26:45.940]   Again, I hope you're following me, okay?
[00:26:45.940 --> 00:26:52.620]   That we don't know why it's defective, we don't know by what criteria, but when we apply
[00:26:52.620 --> 00:26:58.420]   how God applies clean and unclean to all the other things, right?
[00:26:58.420 --> 00:27:03.140]   Like whether it's human being or sacrifice or whether it's food, anything that defiles
[00:27:03.140 --> 00:27:07.620]   God's original intention was considered unclean.
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:12.660]   So if you apply that same principle to these animals, we don't know exactly why they were
[00:27:12.660 --> 00:27:19.800]   considered not God's original plan, but it seems like that's what he's determining.
[00:27:19.800 --> 00:27:24.500]   That these particular animals, these birds and these insects, whatever they were, that
[00:27:24.500 --> 00:27:29.820]   this was in God's original creation, his intent, but these animals for whatever the reason
[00:27:29.820 --> 00:27:37.460]   are living or acting a different way that God has designed.
[00:27:37.460 --> 00:27:40.540]   What they are, I don't know, right?
[00:27:40.540 --> 00:27:41.540]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:27:41.540 --> 00:27:47.260]   Was weed designed by God as that part of the fall?
[00:27:47.260 --> 00:27:53.700]   If you look in the Genesis, was Adam and Eve carnivorous?
[00:27:53.700 --> 00:27:56.700]   We don't see him eating meat, right, before the fall, right?
[00:27:56.700 --> 00:28:01.540]   Now, it doesn't mean that he didn't, but we just don't see it, right?
[00:28:01.540 --> 00:28:06.460]   So there's a lot of things that happened because of the fall, right?
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:09.820]   Now we don't know exactly, we say, "Oh, maybe rats came from the fall."
[00:28:09.820 --> 00:28:11.540]   Yeah, maybe.
[00:28:11.540 --> 00:28:14.880]   Maybe the spiders came from the fall.
[00:28:14.880 --> 00:28:21.200]   We don't know for sure, but all we're doing is applying the same principle that we see
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:26.580]   being applied to human beings, to the sacrifices, to the dough, to the food, that he's applying
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:28.640]   to these animals, right?
[00:28:28.640 --> 00:28:31.780]   We just don't know exactly why, right?
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.980]   Something went wrong.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:35.260]   Something was defective.
[00:28:35.260 --> 00:28:41.220]   Something about it, defective, it wasn't God's original perfect intent, okay?
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:46.140]   And that's about as far as I'll go, because anything beyond that is just a guess and it's
[00:28:46.140 --> 00:28:47.540]   just conjecture, right?
[00:28:47.540 --> 00:28:52.500]   Because up to that point, it seems clear that that's why he's pointing that out.
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:54.460]   It wasn't God's original intent.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:29:00.100]   So maybe when we get to heaven, some of these animals, I don't know.
[00:29:00.100 --> 00:29:02.140]   I don't know what they're going to look like, but it's just a guess.
[00:29:02.140 --> 00:29:05.620]   Again, that's why I'm not going beyond that.
[00:29:05.620 --> 00:29:08.940]   So just to kind of give you a visual, clean and unclean.
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:14.300]   So all the animals up there, they're chewing the cod, it's split hooves, right?
[00:29:14.300 --> 00:29:17.500]   The birds are not birds of prey.
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.220]   And then fish have scale.
[00:29:20.220 --> 00:29:22.980]   What was the other criteria?
[00:29:22.980 --> 00:29:24.460]   A fin, yeah.
[00:29:24.460 --> 00:29:28.540]   And then everything else down here that doesn't fit that criteria, right?
[00:29:28.540 --> 00:29:33.340]   Let me give you another picture.
[00:29:33.340 --> 00:29:42.500]   Okay, so you have the scavengers, creepy things, dirty things.
[00:29:42.500 --> 00:29:49.580]   No split hooves, they don't chew the cod, and then no fin and scales, right?
[00:29:49.580 --> 00:29:54.540]   And the crab is one of them.
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:30:02.180]   Now the significance of this, like ultimately, I thought it was really interesting.
[00:30:02.180 --> 00:30:05.940]   Oh, I forgot to give you one more thing, right?
[00:30:05.940 --> 00:30:12.300]   Not only are they unclean, it says we can become unclean by touching them.
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:15.100]   We can become defiled, right?
[00:30:15.100 --> 00:30:20.000]   So becoming unclean by touch does not necessarily mean that you have sinned.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.820]   So that's a distinction.
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:26.260]   Being unclean doesn't necessarily mean that you have sinned and you need atonement, right?
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.300]   So when you become unclean by touching something that was unclean, you were unclean for the
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:38.560]   rest of that day and you had to wait until midnight, right?
[00:30:38.560 --> 00:30:45.460]   So touching dead animals, again, if you were a farmer, how can you not touch dead animals?
[00:30:45.460 --> 00:30:48.940]   But if you did touch it, you would be considered unclean for the rest of that night.
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:53.980]   So you couldn't go out, go and give sacrifices and do ceremonial things or certain restrictions
[00:30:53.980 --> 00:30:55.980]   once you became unclean.
[00:30:55.980 --> 00:30:59.100]   But it doesn't mean that you sinned, okay?
[00:30:59.100 --> 00:31:06.940]   So make sure that we make that distinction.
[00:31:06.940 --> 00:31:10.980]   So touching them made them unclean, it rendered them unclean until evening time.
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:14.980]   So again, this is part of the reason why they believe that there were hygienic things, because
[00:31:14.980 --> 00:31:21.060]   if you touch something that was infectious, it gave it time for that to leave your system
[00:31:21.060 --> 00:31:23.140]   or to be cleansed by it.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:28.780]   It doesn't say that, but there's clearly some logical conclusions you can make from what
[00:31:28.780 --> 00:31:33.560]   he's doing, because if you had certain kind of infectious disease, you were unclean.
[00:31:33.560 --> 00:31:36.400]   If you were unclean, you had to be isolated for a period.
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:40.580]   So there's some clear hygienic medical purposes for that that's not mentioned.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:46.060]   And that's why the hygienic view is one of the views, and I think there's a mixture of
[00:31:46.060 --> 00:31:49.980]   the symbolic and the hygienic view.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:55.380]   Now to me, the most interesting part of this is why this was implemented.
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:01.540]   There's clearly symbolism that points to Christ, but why this was implemented.
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:07.940]   These dietary laws were temporary and limited only to the Jews.
[00:32:07.940 --> 00:32:11.760]   We know that the laws are divided into three parts.
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:17.140]   You have the moral laws, which would be the Ten Commandments, and then you have the ceremonial
[00:32:17.140 --> 00:32:21.980]   laws, which is what we've been studying, and then you have the civil law, which was given
[00:32:21.980 --> 00:32:25.080]   specific to the nation of Israel.
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:28.920]   So the civil law doesn't apply to us because we're not a Jewish nation.
[00:32:28.920 --> 00:32:32.460]   The ceremonial laws don't apply to us because it was fulfilled in Christ.
[00:32:32.460 --> 00:32:36.980]   The moral law, the Ten Commandments, all of that applies to us today, and is repeated
[00:32:36.980 --> 00:32:40.440]   in the New Testament.
[00:32:40.440 --> 00:32:47.860]   This particular law was specific to the nation of Israel, and even to the nation of Israel,
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:50.180]   it was for a limited time.
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:56.860]   Because we get to the New Testament, and Jesus clearly says to Peter in Acts chapter 10,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.260]   9-29, remember he has a vision, and all these unclean animals are brought down, and then
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:06.140]   Jesus says to eat, and Peter says, "I've never touched anything unclean.
[00:33:06.140 --> 00:33:07.420]   I'm a good Jew."
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:12.500]   And Jesus says to him, "What I declare clean, do not declare unclean."
[00:33:12.500 --> 00:33:16.060]   And then he has to say that three separate times in confirmation to make sure that this
[00:33:16.060 --> 00:33:19.180]   guy wasn't just daydreaming.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:23.500]   So Jesus confirms that, and then that gets confirmed over and over again.
[00:33:23.500 --> 00:33:29.060]   Remember in the book of Acts chapter 15, the first Jewish council was that the Holy Spirit
[00:33:29.060 --> 00:33:32.860]   comes not only on the Jews, but it comes to the Gentiles.
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:36.860]   And so the Gentiles were considered unclean outside of the kingdom, and so when the Holy
[00:33:36.860 --> 00:33:39.540]   Spirit comes, the Jewish community was confused.
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:41.560]   How can the Holy Spirit come to them too?
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:47.700]   So the first Jewish council that takes place in Acts chapter 15 was to address this issue,
[00:33:47.700 --> 00:33:54.640]   that is God bringing Gentiles into the kingdom through Israel, or is he opening up the kingdom
[00:33:54.640 --> 00:33:57.300]   to the Gentiles?
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:03.060]   That was the debate, and it was clearly decided in Acts chapter 15 that the kingdom was being
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:07.660]   opened, that they no longer need to be circumcised, and all the rules and regulations that made
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:13.560]   the Jews Jews were no longer applying to them anymore because the kingdom was opened.
[00:34:13.560 --> 00:34:18.180]   And so that's what caused Apostle Paul to go to his second journey, to go back to the
[00:34:18.180 --> 00:34:23.060]   synagogues where he preached the gospel to tell them that they are released from these
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.060]   laws.
[00:34:24.060 --> 00:34:27.700]   Okay, some of you guys may or may not remember that.
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:29.340]   So that happens in Acts chapter 15.
[00:34:29.340 --> 00:34:36.260]   So Paul, the significance behind all of this was that one of the main things that separated
[00:34:36.260 --> 00:34:41.500]   the Jews and the Gentiles was the diet.
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:46.180]   How many of you, I know there's quite a few of you, maybe about a dozen of you who've
[00:34:46.180 --> 00:34:52.420]   been to China with us, but if you go to the western part of China, they're predominantly,
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.400]   more than half of them are Muslim, the Uyghur people.
[00:34:55.400 --> 00:34:59.980]   So some of you guys may remember when we go to the cafeteria, they had two separate sides.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.060]   They had the sides where the Uyghurs would eat, and then they had the sides where the
[00:35:03.060 --> 00:35:04.900]   Han Chinese would eat.
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:11.540]   And the reason why they had to separate the cafeteria was that the Han Chinese love pork,
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:13.900]   and they consider that unclean.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:18.140]   And so not only could they not eat in the same cafeteria, they couldn't enter a building
[00:35:18.140 --> 00:35:20.820]   where pork was being cooked.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:30.100]   So naturally, the Han Chinese and the Uyghurs do not mix, because they can't eat together.
[00:35:30.100 --> 00:35:36.060]   So if you think about the most fundamental thing that every human being does every single
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:39.660]   day is eating.
[00:35:39.660 --> 00:35:44.980]   But if you can't eat together, you can never intermarry.
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:48.300]   How are you going to marry somebody where one person eats this and the other person
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   can't eat that?
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.540]   Because every single day, you can't even be in the same house.
[00:35:53.540 --> 00:35:57.220]   So Uyghurs would not even walk into a Chinese restaurant.
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:36:00.620]   If they know that pork is being cooked, they can't eat there.
[00:36:00.620 --> 00:36:02.060]   They can't even enter the restaurant.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:04.900]   So it completely keeps them segregated.
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:08.080]   That was the situation with the Jews and the Gentiles.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:12.860]   Because of this dietary law, remember God told the nation of Israel, you get into this
[00:36:12.860 --> 00:36:18.020]   land, what is the thing that he kept on telling them over and over again?
[00:36:18.020 --> 00:36:19.900]   To be separate.
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.540]   They're not to intermarry.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:25.260]   They're not to follow their customs.
[00:36:25.260 --> 00:36:30.140]   They are meant to be Israelites almost in isolation.
[00:36:30.140 --> 00:36:36.500]   So a Gentile can convert and become a Jew, but a Jew can never go the other way if he
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:37.780]   is faithful to God.
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:43.460]   So by nature of God's law, if they were faithful Jews, he kept them separate from the rest
[00:36:43.460 --> 00:36:44.820]   of the world.
[00:36:44.820 --> 00:36:49.580]   And so there's a reason why the Jews didn't want to go through Samaria.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:53.620]   Because they believed that if they went through Samaria because Samaritans were compromised
[00:36:53.620 --> 00:36:57.660]   and they weren't obedient to God's laws, that they would be compromised by entering into
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:36:59.820]   that land.
[00:36:59.820 --> 00:37:03.100]   Jews could not enter into a Gentile home.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.460]   So the Jews, where they ate, where they lived, where they raised their children, were completely
[00:37:07.460 --> 00:37:09.220]   separated from the Gentiles.
[00:37:09.220 --> 00:37:14.780]   Because they would be considered defiled.
[00:37:14.780 --> 00:37:15.780]   You understand?
[00:37:15.780 --> 00:37:21.260]   You understand like God's whole intent for the nation of Israel was to keep them separate.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:25.660]   And the most basic thing that would keep a whole nation separate from the other nation
[00:37:25.660 --> 00:37:30.460]   is by restricting their diet.
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:36.500]   But when the gospel comes, the first thing that happens is these laws are gone.
[00:37:36.500 --> 00:37:38.900]   And the Gentiles are brought in.
[00:37:38.900 --> 00:37:41.860]   God determines that it is clean.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:47.300]   And at the fullness of time when Christ comes, the thing that kept the Gentiles and the Jews
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:52.540]   separate from each other, he says he takes the barrier out.
[00:37:52.540 --> 00:37:57.980]   In Ephesians chapter 2, 11 to 22, he says that the wall of separation was removed because
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:37:59.960]   of Christ.
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:04.260]   So not only was the curtain torn, remember when Jesus dies, the curtain into the Holy
[00:38:04.260 --> 00:38:05.980]   of Holies is torn?
[00:38:05.980 --> 00:38:09.900]   The temple itself is destroyed.
[00:38:09.900 --> 00:38:14.540]   Because even in the temple, there was a place where the Jewish men can go, women can go,
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:15.540]   and Gentiles can go.
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:19.860]   And if you had any kind of defect, you were not allowed to come in and participate in
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:21.700]   the worship with the Jews.
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:30.980]   That's why in the book of Acts, remember when Philip gets carried out and he runs into who?
[00:38:30.980 --> 00:38:33.260]   A eunuch.
[00:38:33.260 --> 00:38:35.300]   An Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:38:35.300 --> 00:38:37.300]   So he's a Gentile, right?
[00:38:37.300 --> 00:38:38.300]   An Ethiopian.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:41.460]   And he's a eunuch, so he's defected.
[00:38:41.460 --> 00:38:43.460]   So he has double whammy on him.
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:48.700]   So he would not be able to, traditionally, in a Jewish religion, he would not be able
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:51.140]   to enter into the temple and to be able to worship.
[00:38:51.140 --> 00:38:55.100]   So he could have been a God-fearer who worshiped God from a distance, but he would never be
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:59.660]   able to enter into the temple because of who he was.
[00:38:59.660 --> 00:39:04.180]   So it wasn't just random that all of a sudden he runs into the Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:08.780]   Him running into the Ethiopian eunuch was symbolic of the kingdom of God being opened
[00:39:08.780 --> 00:39:11.220]   to everyone.
[00:39:11.220 --> 00:39:12.220]   And so that's what happened.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.620]   So the Jews were having a hard time because they lived for so many years thinking that
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:22.940]   this diet kept them holy, but all of a sudden, Jesus says to Peter, "What I say is clean.
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:23.940]   Don't say it's unclean."
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:26.260]   In other words, the kingdom of God is being opened.
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:30.060]   Now Gentiles are coming in just like everybody else.
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:34.740]   And the wall that separated the Jews and Gentiles is vanished.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:38.180]   And the laws were given to Israel to distinguish them from the rest of the world.
[00:39:38.180 --> 00:39:44.320]   And then the passage in 44 through 46, again, summarizes for us, even if we didn't understand
[00:39:44.320 --> 00:39:50.500]   the details of how it was applied and why it was applied, Leviticus 44 through 46 gives
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:53.860]   us the reason behind his commandments.
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:55.660]   For I am the Lord your God.
[00:39:55.660 --> 00:39:58.260]   Consecrate yourselves therefore and be holy, for I am holy.
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:40:02.180]   In other words, consecrate means to be separate.
[00:40:02.180 --> 00:40:05.580]   You shall not defy yourself with any swarming thing that crawls on the ground, for I am
[00:40:05.580 --> 00:40:08.660]   the Lord who brought you up out of the land of Egypt to be your God.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.740]   You shall therefore be holy, for I am holy.
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.500]   Again, the word holy literally means to be set apart.
[00:40:14.500 --> 00:40:15.580]   To be set apart.
[00:40:15.580 --> 00:40:19.500]   So in this particular situation, to be set apart with your diet from the rest of the
[00:40:19.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   world.
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:23.740]   This is the law about the beast and the bird and every living creature that moves through
[00:40:23.740 --> 00:40:26.420]   the waters and every creature that swarms on the ground.
[00:40:26.420 --> 00:40:32.220]   So the whole point of this was to consecrate Israel, to be set apart, and for the purpose
[00:40:32.220 --> 00:40:35.140]   of declaring God's glory.
[00:40:35.140 --> 00:40:43.140]   But we come to the New Testament in 2 Corinthians 6, 14-7, it says, "Do not be unequally yoked
[00:40:43.140 --> 00:40:44.140]   with an unbeliever.
[00:40:44.140 --> 00:40:47.180]   For what partnership is righteousness with lawlessness?
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.460]   Or what fellowship is light with darkness?
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.260]   What accord has Christ with Belial?
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:53.940]   Or what portion does a believer share with an unbeliever?
[00:40:53.940 --> 00:40:55.860]   What agreement has the temple of God with idols?
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.500]   For we are the temple of the living God.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.540]   As God said, 'I will make my dwelling among them and walk among them, and I will be their
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:03.740]   God and they shall be my people.'
[00:41:03.740 --> 00:41:08.140]   Therefore go out from their midst and be separate from them, says the Lord, and touch no unclean
[00:41:08.140 --> 00:41:10.220]   thing, then I will welcome you.
[00:41:10.220 --> 00:41:13.580]   And I will be a father to you and you shall be sons and daughters to me, says the Lord
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:14.580]   Almighty.
[00:41:14.580 --> 00:41:18.260]   Since we have these promises, beloved, let us cleanse ourselves from every defilement
[00:41:18.260 --> 00:41:23.280]   of the body of spirit, bringing holiness to completion in the fear of God."
[00:41:23.280 --> 00:41:27.860]   So if you look at the language of 2 Corinthians, he's talking to the new covenant people, but
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:32.540]   he's using the same language of Leviticus, to be set apart.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.460]   But now we're not being set apart because of diet.
[00:41:35.460 --> 00:41:40.180]   We're not being set apart because of the tabernacle sacrificial system.
[00:41:40.180 --> 00:41:44.060]   He's saying to be set apart in your moral character, right?
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:45.540]   And not to be.
[00:41:45.540 --> 00:41:52.900]   So the symbolism behind that is Christ fulfilled the barrier, the dietary and the civic and
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:59.220]   civil laws that Gentiles could be the same, but we as a church now is the spirit of God,
[00:41:59.220 --> 00:42:01.380]   is the temple of God, right?
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:02.740]   So we ought to be distinct.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.560]   We ought to be separate from the world.
[00:42:04.560 --> 00:42:09.100]   And I think that problem that we get into is we try so hard to make the non-Christians
[00:42:09.100 --> 00:42:14.900]   feel comfortable in the church that we lose our distinct identity as children of God,
[00:42:14.900 --> 00:42:15.900]   right?
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:21.140]   And we need to be careful that we don't ignore the non-Christians because God calls us to
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:25.180]   be non-Christians, but then we don't ignore what it means to be holy because our primary
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:28.180]   call is to be set apart to worship God, okay?
[00:42:28.180 --> 00:42:32.540]   So I only put that up there to show you that so much of the language in the New Testament
[00:42:32.540 --> 00:42:38.100]   for the church comes from the language we see in the book of Leviticus, right?
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:40.840]   Remember John 4, 9?
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.180]   The Samaritan woman said to Jesus, "How is it that a Jew asks for a drink from me, a
[00:42:45.180 --> 00:42:49.420]   woman of Samaria, for Jews have no dealings with Samaritans?"
[00:42:49.420 --> 00:42:54.540]   Meaning that because of the separation, right, he was surprised that Jesus was spending even
[00:42:54.540 --> 00:43:01.540]   any time because if he was a Jew, let alone a rabbi talking to a sinner who happens to
[00:43:01.540 --> 00:43:06.300]   be a Gentile, it says this guy is as holy as you can be, right?
[00:43:06.300 --> 00:43:11.180]   He's a holy man in the Jewish community who even among the Gentiles was considered a sinner.
[00:43:11.180 --> 00:43:14.740]   For Jesus to come and even talk to her, she was like, "This is unheard of.
[00:43:14.740 --> 00:43:15.900]   Why would you do this?"
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:19.900]   Because this was a common practice among the Jews, right?
[00:43:19.900 --> 00:43:23.260]   So that's what he was referring to when he says the barriers have been taken out.
[00:43:23.260 --> 00:43:28.700]   Matthew 15, 17, 20, "Do you not see that whatever goes into the mouth passes into the
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:30.540]   stomach and is expelled?
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:34.440]   But what comes out of the mouth proceeds from the heart and this defiles a person.
[00:43:34.440 --> 00:43:37.980]   For out of the heart comes evil thoughts, murder, adultery, sexual immorality, theft,
[00:43:37.980 --> 00:43:39.340]   false witness, slander.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:45.120]   These are what defile a person, but to eat with unwashed hand does not defile anyone."
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:47.780]   Now why does he use that language?
[00:43:47.780 --> 00:43:51.620]   Does that sound a lot like the Jews?
[00:43:51.620 --> 00:43:56.500]   They're probably referring to this because the Jews thought that if they kept these dietary
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:44:00.700]   laws that that's how they're going to be holy and Jesus said it's not what you put in.
[00:44:00.700 --> 00:44:04.060]   The whole point of that was not to make you clean, but it was to point to something else
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:06.060]   in Christ, right?
[00:44:06.060 --> 00:44:10.620]   But again, I'm showing you this because so much of the New Testament language comes from
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:11.620]   the Old Testament.
[00:44:11.620 --> 00:44:26.060]   And the Jews would have immediately thought of this when Jesus said this.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:33.060]   So if you notice the distinction in the Old Covenant, God told the nation of Israel to
[00:44:33.060 --> 00:44:35.980]   come to him, right?
[00:44:35.980 --> 00:44:37.980]   So remember how we studied Exodus?
[00:44:37.980 --> 00:44:41.940]   Exodus was God coming out to the mountain and he tells people to stay away.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:43.420]   If you come, you will die.
[00:44:43.420 --> 00:44:47.180]   We come to Leviticus where he sets up the tabernacle and he begins to prepare and he
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.340]   speaks from the tabernacle, but they're not able to enter yet because tabernacle is not
[00:44:51.340 --> 00:44:53.100]   established, right?
[00:44:53.100 --> 00:44:58.620]   So chapter 10 was the beginning of the sacrifices, but the very first one, because they didn't
[00:44:58.620 --> 00:45:04.080]   consider him holy, they didn't take it seriously, they end up dying, right?
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:08.660]   So the whole point of it is this holy God dwelling among sinful people, so he's preparing
[00:45:08.660 --> 00:45:10.900]   them to come to them, but they weren't ready.
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.740]   And if they are going to come to him, they have to follow these rules strictly.
[00:45:14.740 --> 00:45:19.120]   We get to Numbers where he invites them into the sanctuary, right?
[00:45:19.120 --> 00:45:22.760]   But even as he comes to the sanctuary, there's a division between where they can go, where
[00:45:22.760 --> 00:45:26.940]   they cannot go, because the inner sanctuary where God is, they could not enter.
[00:45:26.940 --> 00:45:28.840]   There's a curtain that divides them.
[00:45:28.840 --> 00:45:31.700]   And that was the system that was taught the nation of Israel.
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.740]   Separate from the world and come to me.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:39.220]   You can come to me as close, closer than anybody else in the world, but even you can only come
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:40.820]   this far, right?
[00:45:40.820 --> 00:45:41.980]   That was the old covenant.
[00:45:41.980 --> 00:45:47.540]   In the new covenant, God tears the curtain, he opens the door, and then what does he do?
[00:45:47.540 --> 00:45:50.240]   He tells us to go.
[00:45:50.240 --> 00:45:52.440]   He doesn't tell us to come, he tells us to go.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:56.700]   So last commandment, "Go therefore and make disciples of all the nations."
[00:45:56.700 --> 00:46:00.340]   Where before he says, "Separate from them and come to me," right?
[00:46:00.340 --> 00:46:04.520]   The new covenant, he says, "Now the door has been opened, now you go to them.
[00:46:04.520 --> 00:46:07.820]   And what kept you from them now is gone."
[00:46:07.820 --> 00:46:08.820]   Right?
[00:46:08.820 --> 00:46:13.420]   Again, 1 Peter 2.9, "But you are a chosen race, a royal priest, a holy nation of people
[00:46:13.420 --> 00:46:17.440]   for his own possession that you may proclaim the excellence of him who called you out of
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:19.340]   darkness into his marvelous light."
[00:46:19.340 --> 00:46:26.060]   So that was the same passage referring to the Old Testament covenant people, now the
[00:46:26.060 --> 00:46:31.060]   New Testament covenant people, where people, he told them to come, "Declare my glory by
[00:46:31.060 --> 00:46:40.740]   being separate," but now he says, "Declare my glory by going," right?
[00:46:40.740 --> 00:46:46.020]   In Jeremiah 31.33, he says of the new covenant, "But this is the covenant that I will make
[00:46:46.020 --> 00:46:48.180]   with the house of Israel after those days, declares the Lord.
[00:46:48.180 --> 00:46:51.700]   I will put my law within them, and I will write it on their hearts, and I will be their
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:54.060]   God and they shall be my people."
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.700]   Where everything that we've been studying Leviticus is to how to be pure and without
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:01.700]   defect physically, externally.
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:04.700]   But he said there's going to come a time in the new covenant where the laws are going
[00:47:04.700 --> 00:47:07.660]   to be written in our hearts, right?
[00:47:07.660 --> 00:47:11.380]   Meaning that what defiles you is going to ultimately be internal.
[00:47:11.380 --> 00:47:14.700]   True worship is going to be in spirit and in truth.
[00:47:14.700 --> 00:47:18.100]   It's not going to be following regulations in and of itself, but it's going to be spirit
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:20.220]   and in truth, right?
[00:47:20.220 --> 00:47:27.620]   So these dietary laws existed for a period to separate Israel from the world, but now
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:34.460]   that we are in a period where God's sending us to go, he's again taking that barrier out,
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:35.780]   right?
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:40.780]   And then Hebrews 10.16, so this is the covenant that I will make with them after those days,
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   declares the Lord.
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:46.620]   I will put my laws on their hearts and write them again on their minds.
[00:47:46.620 --> 00:47:49.340]   Okay.
[00:47:49.340 --> 00:47:54.900]   So understanding the dietary laws, we may not understand the intricate details.
[00:47:54.900 --> 00:47:55.900]   You want me to go back?
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:56.900]   Okay.
[00:47:56.900 --> 00:47:57.900]   There's nothing to write.
[00:47:57.900 --> 00:47:58.900]   It's just a verse.
[00:47:58.900 --> 00:47:59.900]   Did I miss something?
[00:47:59.900 --> 00:48:00.900]   What did I miss?
[00:48:00.900 --> 00:48:01.900]   This?
[00:48:01.900 --> 00:48:21.820]   Like here?
[00:48:21.820 --> 00:48:40.820]   There's something after this?
[00:48:40.820 --> 00:48:49.100]   Oh, number two.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:51.420]   So right here.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:58.940]   So it should be in between, right?
[00:48:58.940 --> 00:49:01.940]   Two and three?
[00:49:01.940 --> 00:49:05.820]   All right.
[00:49:05.820 --> 00:49:11.100]   It seems like I changed it on your paper and not mine.
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:12.100]   Yeah.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.500]   I printed mine out before.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:14.500]   Maybe I did that.
[00:49:14.500 --> 00:49:18.100]   So I have no idea what you're talking about.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:21.660]   So there's a line here that says biblical meaning of Christian liberty means to be freed
[00:49:21.660 --> 00:49:23.740]   from the dietary laws.
[00:49:23.740 --> 00:49:25.140]   Is that what you're referring to?
[00:49:25.140 --> 00:49:26.140]   Okay.
[00:49:26.140 --> 00:49:27.140]   I'll just read it to you.
[00:49:27.140 --> 00:49:30.700]   Dietary laws to be able to go to the Gentiles to spread the gospel and become one in the
[00:49:30.700 --> 00:49:31.700]   church.
[00:49:31.700 --> 00:49:37.900]   So the Christian liberty in our generation has been used to justify doing whatever we
[00:49:37.900 --> 00:49:38.900]   want.
[00:49:38.900 --> 00:49:40.460]   Like we have liberty in Christ.
[00:49:40.460 --> 00:49:45.740]   The liberty in the context that is used in the scripture is talking about having the
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:51.340]   liberty to be able to go into a Gentile home, to be able to eat meat that was sacrificed
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:55.380]   to idols and not worry about is it clean or unclean.
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.860]   Because it's just meat, right?
[00:49:56.860 --> 00:49:58.940]   And that's what Paul is referring to.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:03.380]   And it's in the context of opening the kingdom to the Gentiles, that you no longer need to
[00:50:03.380 --> 00:50:05.860]   be separated from them.
[00:50:05.860 --> 00:50:09.860]   Christian liberty is not you have the freedom to do whatever you want because Christ died
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:10.860]   for you.
[00:50:10.860 --> 00:50:13.020]   That's not Christian liberty.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:18.180]   That's whatever it is, that's not in the Bible.
[00:50:18.180 --> 00:50:20.380]   Is the wrong application, wrong understanding of that.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:25.620]   So again, the Christian liberty is we have the liberty where we don't have a barrier.
[00:50:25.620 --> 00:50:31.060]   We don't have to worry about like is this clean or unclean in the context of evangelizing
[00:50:31.060 --> 00:50:34.900]   and bringing them into the kingdom.
[00:50:34.900 --> 00:50:42.540]   I don't know what else is missing, but that's all I have.
[00:50:42.540 --> 00:50:44.940]   Go make disciples of all nations.
[00:50:44.940 --> 00:50:45.940]   Okay.
[00:50:45.940 --> 00:50:47.340]   Oh, okay.
[00:50:47.340 --> 00:50:48.820]   I didn't put that up there.
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:54.860]   I just put the verse, but I didn't put the...
[00:50:54.860 --> 00:51:00.060]   And then point number three, all the laws were to restrict and command external obedience,
[00:51:00.060 --> 00:51:04.660]   number one, but the new covenant law is written on our hearts to worship in spirit and in
[00:51:04.660 --> 00:51:06.260]   truth.
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:07.500]   Is that what you're referring to?
[00:51:07.500 --> 00:51:08.500]   Okay, my bad.
[00:51:08.500 --> 00:51:12.940]   I put all the verses and I didn't put the main thing.
[00:51:12.940 --> 00:51:14.180]   Okay.
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:23.860]   I don't know about you, but I thought it was really interesting that at least this is a
[00:51:23.860 --> 00:51:27.980]   part that I didn't fully understand the first time I preached through it.
[00:51:27.980 --> 00:51:33.780]   Seeing God's economy, how in the Old Testament his intent was to bring them and then after
[00:51:33.780 --> 00:51:38.620]   Christ comes now, he's sending us and so he takes every barrier that kept us separate
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.820]   from the world to go and to be among them and to preach the gospel so that they can
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:44.500]   come into the kingdom.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:49.420]   And so that's why when Paul says, "Whether you eat or drink, do it all for the glory
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.100]   of God," right?
[00:51:51.100 --> 00:51:53.660]   So it's not what you eat and how you eat and how much you eat.
[00:51:53.660 --> 00:51:58.140]   I mean, the point of it is not the external.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:01.660]   The point of it is internal, is why you do it, right?
[00:52:01.660 --> 00:52:04.540]   And all for the purpose of going out and making disciples.
[00:52:04.540 --> 00:52:10.460]   That's why Apostle Paul, he circumcises Timothy for the sake of the gospel and then he doesn't
[00:52:10.460 --> 00:52:14.180]   circumcise Titus for the sake of the gospel.
[00:52:14.180 --> 00:52:16.140]   It wasn't about circumcision.
[00:52:16.140 --> 00:52:18.980]   The whole point of it was to become all things to all men.
[00:52:18.980 --> 00:52:24.680]   Now he has the freedom to become all things to all men by all means that he can save some.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:27.900]   And that's the point of Christian liberty, right?
[00:52:27.900 --> 00:52:33.300]   Now that this barrier has been gone, there's nothing that keeps us from going to the world,
[00:52:33.300 --> 00:52:34.700]   right?
[00:52:34.700 --> 00:52:39.340]   Oops, can you go back?
[00:52:39.340 --> 00:52:42.140]   Let me just quickly explain.
[00:52:42.140 --> 00:52:43.740]   Okay.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:49.300]   So, question number one, the old covenant people have had very clear lines drawn for
[00:52:49.300 --> 00:52:51.860]   them to distinguish them from the pagan world.
[00:52:51.860 --> 00:52:55.500]   If as new covenant people, those barriers have been removed, how do we distinguish between
[00:52:55.500 --> 00:52:57.620]   being in the world and being of the world?
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:01.700]   Are there any lines that Christians should abide by to distinguish us from the world?
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:03.940]   You understand the question, right?
[00:53:03.940 --> 00:53:08.380]   So I think the error that we can make is since there is no distinguishing line that we can
[00:53:08.380 --> 00:53:09.640]   be like the world.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:14.900]   And yet the scripture is filled in the new testament and new covenant to be holy, right?
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:19.140]   The commandment to be holy in the old testament, the same commandment is true in the new testament.
[00:53:19.140 --> 00:53:20.460]   But what does it mean to be holy?
[00:53:20.460 --> 00:53:24.340]   Because in the old covenant, when God said to be holy, they immediately thought of these
[00:53:24.340 --> 00:53:25.340]   regulations.
[00:53:25.340 --> 00:53:31.020]   But what does it mean to be holy in the new testament, right?
[00:53:31.020 --> 00:53:35.100]   Same commandment, but the application is going to look very different in the new testament.
[00:53:35.100 --> 00:53:36.680]   And yet it's there, right?
[00:53:36.680 --> 00:53:40.260]   Number two, in first Corinthians 10, 23, we are told that all things are lawful, but not
[00:53:40.260 --> 00:53:42.460]   all things are profitable or helpful.
[00:53:42.460 --> 00:53:45.940]   How do you distinguish if something is profitable or not?
[00:53:45.940 --> 00:53:49.540]   Read rest of context of first Corinthians 10, 20 through 33 for insight.
[00:53:49.540 --> 00:53:52.220]   Some of you guys probably already know that text, right?
[00:53:52.220 --> 00:53:56.060]   It's about why you eat the meat, you know, who does it bother?
[00:53:56.060 --> 00:53:59.700]   So how do we distinguish between something being profitable, unprofitable?
[00:53:59.700 --> 00:54:04.940]   I think the biggest challenge that most of us have today is not between should I watch
[00:54:04.940 --> 00:54:06.700]   pornography, not watch pornography?
[00:54:06.700 --> 00:54:08.460]   Should I lie or cheat?
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:09.860]   Those are clear lines.
[00:54:09.860 --> 00:54:15.540]   It's just that we are so distracted by unprofitable things that there's no room for the things
[00:54:15.540 --> 00:54:17.180]   of God.
[00:54:17.180 --> 00:54:23.940]   We're filled with things that don't match, that have no, you know, has no benefit whatsoever
[00:54:23.940 --> 00:54:29.780]   to our spiritual life, but we're so saturated in our lives with that, that there's no room
[00:54:29.780 --> 00:54:31.540]   for the things of God, right?
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:34.260]   There's no appetite for the things of God, right?
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.180]   The other extreme you can go is that you can say, well, where do we draw the line?
[00:54:38.180 --> 00:54:39.340]   And then you draw no lines.
[00:54:39.340 --> 00:54:42.900]   And then, or the other extreme is that you draw every line where you start becoming a
[00:54:42.900 --> 00:54:43.900]   legalist.
[00:54:43.900 --> 00:54:45.060]   How do you distinguish, right?
[00:54:45.060 --> 00:54:46.580]   How do you apply that wisdom?
[00:54:46.580 --> 00:54:50.860]   Verse three, what are some unnecessary barriers that the church has created that may cause
[00:54:50.860 --> 00:54:53.560]   a non-Christian to not want to come to church?
[00:54:53.560 --> 00:54:58.300]   How do you balance between taking away barriers versus compromising the church's integrity
[00:54:58.300 --> 00:55:01.180]   of holiness and worship to accommodate unbelievers?
[00:55:01.180 --> 00:55:04.220]   So hopefully you'll have some good conversations today.
[00:55:04.220 --> 00:55:12.940]   So let me pray for us and then I'll let you guys go to your small group.
[00:55:12.940 --> 00:55:20.820]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, Father God, that what we have today, whether we've been
[00:55:20.820 --> 00:55:26.540]   a Christian for a short period or long, that we know, Father God, that you've been pursuing
[00:55:26.540 --> 00:55:32.540]   us before we were ever aware of you, that all of these laws, Lord God, was to prepare
[00:55:32.540 --> 00:55:36.840]   for the coming of Christ to set us apart.
[00:55:36.840 --> 00:55:40.340]   And I pray that you would help us to glean that even now, Father, that there's so many
[00:55:40.340 --> 00:55:42.820]   things that we don't fully understand.
[00:55:42.820 --> 00:55:46.580]   I pray that you would give us an appetite for your word, that we would hunger and thirst
[00:55:46.580 --> 00:55:52.340]   for it, that we would not be satisfied with just the superficial explanations, but we
[00:55:52.340 --> 00:55:55.200]   know that it's living and active, that ultimately it's your word.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:56:01.700]   So help us, Lord God, to come to it with eagerness, to seek treasure, Father God, and not just
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:03.380]   information.
[00:56:03.380 --> 00:56:06.260]   We pray that you would be with us in our discussion.
[00:56:06.260 --> 00:56:12.800]   Help us, Lord, that our discussions and things that we say would not be led by our flesh.
[00:56:12.800 --> 00:56:18.700]   Help us, Lord God, to have discussions that are biblical and that we would apply wisdom
[00:56:18.700 --> 00:56:20.460]   and with surrendered hearts.
[00:56:20.460 --> 00:56:22.460]   So we pray for your grace and guidance during this time.
[00:56:22.460 --> 00:56:24.020]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:34.020]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
