[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.960]   Alright, let's look at Isaiah chapter 44 verses...
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:20.400]   So if you notice that the previous passage, it ended with sort of a reminder of Israel's
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.880]   sin and then if you look at verse 25 and 28 through 28 in chapter 43, it was a call to
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   repentance.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:33.080]   So the theme that we begin in chapter 44 is connected to that, where God is still calling
[00:00:33.080 --> 00:00:38.080]   out and if you remember at the very end, again there's a prophecy of God's faithfulness and
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.200]   so chapter 44 begins by reminding us of what Israel, how Israel means, like what Israel
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:46.200]   means to the Lord.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.120]   So the first question was that why is Israel told not to fear?
[00:00:50.120 --> 00:00:52.200]   Right?
[00:00:52.200 --> 00:00:54.200]   Whoops.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:58.200]   What happened?
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:02.200]   Okay, so it's only the first one.
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.200]   Alright, there you go.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.200]   Okay, you can just jot it down and then I'll talk after you guys jot it down.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:12.200]   Okay.
[00:01:12.200 --> 00:01:18.200]   Okay.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:24.200]   Okay.
[00:01:24.200 --> 00:01:30.200]   Okay.
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:36.200]   Okay.
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:42.200]   Okay.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:48.200]   Okay.
[00:01:48.200 --> 00:01:54.200]   Okay.
[00:01:54.200 --> 00:02:00.200]   Okay.
[00:02:00.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   Okay.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   Okay.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:24.840]   Alright, so the first question was the theme again in the first three verses where God
[00:02:24.840 --> 00:02:30.320]   is reminding the nation of Israel and kind of encouraging them not to fear and the reason
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:35.600]   why the again the reason why he says not to fear is main theme in the first three verses
[00:02:35.600 --> 00:02:37.800]   is that God has not abandoned them.
[00:02:37.800 --> 00:02:38.800]   Right?
[00:02:38.800 --> 00:02:42.600]   Remember we talked about that last week where there's a there's a pronouncement of judgment
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:45.960]   and then he says but I have not forgotten you and so it's going back and forth.
[00:02:45.960 --> 00:02:51.560]   So last week we talked about how God reminds them in verse 21 how he brought judgment upon
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:56.840]   them but they didn't see this from the Lord and they didn't turn to him and give sacrifices.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.960]   You know and yet despite that it ends with God pleading with them to come return to them.
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:03.960]   Right?
[00:03:03.960 --> 00:03:09.400]   So despite their sins despite their failures despite the lack of genuine sacrifice that
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.560]   they're bringing to God God says I have not abandoned you and the reason why he gives
[00:03:13.560 --> 00:03:17.440]   several reasons here like God has God has formed you from your mother's womb God has
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:22.160]   chosen you God will bless you and your descendants you are the Lord's that so let's look at one
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:26.620]   by one when he says God has formed you from the womb you hear this quite often whenever
[00:03:26.620 --> 00:03:31.480]   God is trying to encourage or to remind the nation that he is with them that that phrase
[00:03:31.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   is like I've known you or God formed me from my mother's womb what what is the imagery
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:40.440]   and what is the encouragement that he's giving when he says that because you see you see
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:45.960]   that over and over when whenever either David is saying that of himself how God knew me
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:51.800]   he knew my inner parts even from my mother's womb or God is telling Israel or or a particular
[00:03:51.800 --> 00:03:58.280]   person right so those of you who live in more sensitive than other people right so what
[00:03:58.280 --> 00:04:01.840]   kind of encouragement do you find like in what context would that be an encouragement
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:12.660]   like I knew you from your mother's womb there's a kind of an intimacy that this is not just
[00:04:12.660 --> 00:04:18.720]   somebody that you met randomly right this is in a sense it's kind of like family right
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:22.400]   like I've known you since you're like I say that like if if I've known somebody for a
[00:04:22.400 --> 00:04:25.560]   long time and there's a deep affection I would say yeah I've known you since you were a little
[00:04:25.560 --> 00:04:29.920]   kid you know what I mean but it goes even deeper than that right even before you knew
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:34.880]   yourself you mean before you your parents may have known you I knew you right so why
[00:04:34.880 --> 00:04:44.040]   why is that an encouragement not to fear that's how much you mean to me right that's what
[00:04:44.040 --> 00:04:48.300]   God is saying to Israel you don't have to fear because you're not just like anybody
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:54.400]   else right that's how much you mean to me it's like I have chosen you right you didn't
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:59.880]   choose me I chose you so whatever whatever danger is around you like I chose you so in
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:04.720]   other words I'm gonna protect you like I will bless you and your descent is not only not
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:09.960]   only is it just a temporary blessing but this blessing is gonna be upon you and for descendants
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:15.200]   to come right it's not just a I'm not just gonna deliver you from a temporary danger
[00:05:15.200 --> 00:05:22.480]   but but I my blessing is upon you and your descendants right and then verse 5 where he
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:26.840]   says the one will say I am the Lord's another will call on the name of Jacob another will
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:30.600]   write on his hand the Lord's in other words you belong to me and that's kind of like the
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:35.240]   summary of everything that he's saying here right so you don't need to fear because my
[00:05:35.240 --> 00:05:41.560]   name is on you right again same thing with us as Christians the reason why we don't fear
[00:05:41.560 --> 00:05:45.880]   why we don't you know we don't teeter-totter back and forth just like he says if he is
[00:05:45.880 --> 00:05:50.160]   for us who can be against us and that's basically what he's saying to the nation of Israel no
[00:05:50.160 --> 00:05:54.800]   matter what happens right no matter again he's gonna be talking about how site he's
[00:05:54.800 --> 00:05:59.520]   gonna establish King Cyrus to to deliver them and then he's gonna revert back in history
[00:05:59.520 --> 00:06:05.540]   remember I talked about last week like Isaiah is prophesying even before the captivity it
[00:06:05.540 --> 00:06:11.120]   may have happened during his lifetime but how long of a time passes from the moment
[00:06:11.120 --> 00:06:15.960]   that Isaiah is prophesying this and Cyrus actually comes into power the Persians come
[00:06:15.960 --> 00:06:25.640]   into power I mentioned it in passing last week more 150 to possibly 200 years right
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:31.840]   150 to possibly 200 years where he's prophesying so he's looking way in the future you can
[00:06:31.840 --> 00:06:37.160]   see why some people like if you don't believe in miracles and prophecies like oh Isaiah
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:42.680]   could not have written this right Isaiah may have written written portions of it but that
[00:06:42.680 --> 00:06:47.800]   portion where his his specific name right and what he was going to do he prophesied
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:53.640]   200 years before it happens so either this is a miracle of God right God is actually
[00:06:53.640 --> 00:07:00.480]   speaking through him and prophesying or sorry or I could not have written this right because
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.600]   how can you promise how can you actually mention somebody's name in 200 years it comes true
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:10.480]   so basically he prophesied that King Cyrus is gonna come he's gonna be his agent to deliver
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:14.480]   them and then he goes into description of the Babylonians and what they're gonna come
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.200]   and do right so he's kind of telling them telling them again in the future these things
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:26.200]   may not have even happened yet but when they come do not fear right what evidences are
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:34.240]   given in the next verses six seven and eight right that he is the king once so the first
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:38.000]   section he begins by saying you don't need to fear because I knew you in the mother's
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:43.360]   womb I chose you I will bless your nations my name is a for your mind right and then
[00:07:43.360 --> 00:07:49.760]   the second part of it he says well who are you well I'm your king right I'm the one I'm
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:59.880]   the king because I redeemed you right you belong to me again same thing with us you
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:04.940]   know the Bible describes our salvation as moving kingdoms right we've been transferred
[00:08:04.940 --> 00:08:10.480]   from the kingdom of darkness to kingdom of his son right so he says I'm your king because
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:18.280]   I redeemed you I'm your king in verse 7 because what I have said has come true who is like
[00:08:18.280 --> 00:08:22.600]   me let him proclaim it let him declare and said it before me since I appointed an ancient
[00:08:22.600 --> 00:08:27.400]   people let them declare what is to come and what will happen so again what is the encouragement
[00:08:27.400 --> 00:08:36.700]   here when he says what I declare it comes true how would you be encouraged if you heard
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:51.520]   that right every promise he makes will come true that's basically what he's saying like
[00:08:51.520 --> 00:08:56.600]   he's not giving empty promises what other king what other idol can tell you these things
[00:08:56.600 --> 00:09:05.520]   and then see it comes true right test to see so he's the first and the last again that
[00:09:05.520 --> 00:09:11.240]   title is given to Christ is given to God and it's in again many different passages throughout
[00:09:11.240 --> 00:09:20.480]   the scripture so what does it mean to be first and last what's another way that Paul says
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:28.760]   it first and last everything is created by him and for him right that he is sovereign
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:37.000]   over the past present and future right all right so this is a third question again I'm
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.080]   just gonna leave these for your discussion later but what's the difference between someone
[00:09:41.080 --> 00:09:45.000]   who was walking in the spirit because the reason why I ask this is because one of the
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.240]   promises he makes is that upon the descendants I was blessed you by pouring my spirit upon
[00:09:50.240 --> 00:09:54.400]   you right so what is the difference between walking in the spirit versus someone who's
[00:09:54.400 --> 00:09:58.080]   walking in the flesh what tangible things do you see that are different in your life
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:05.000]   okay so again I'll leave that for your discussion later all right so what's the main point of
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.960]   verses 9 through 20 he gives a long illustration about these idols so I want you to take a
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:16.160]   minute okay take a few minutes I'm sure you'll have more time later on in your small group
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:21.680]   to discuss it but in your small group just take a few minutes and I think there's there
[00:10:21.680 --> 00:10:27.800]   are probably more than one lesson here it's not it's kind of like a parable so parables
[00:10:27.800 --> 00:10:33.440]   don't have a like a sharp point like when Jesus tells a parable he kind of sums it up
[00:10:33.440 --> 00:10:37.600]   and then you know what his point is right but in this parable nobody's summing it up
[00:10:37.600 --> 00:10:43.560]   it just kind of presented to you and so you may gain different insights right you can't
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:48.240]   make up stuff but within the story that he tells what's the point that that he's trying
[00:10:48.240 --> 00:10:53.800]   to make about the idols and about Israel okay so take a few minutes okay don't do your homework
[00:10:53.800 --> 00:11:01.600]   now okay take a few minutes to discuss with your group what what is he saying versus 9
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:05.040]   through 20 what is he teaching
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:08.040]   [INAUDIBLE]

[00:17:23.040 --> 00:17:27.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:27.040 --> 00:17:31.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:35.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:35.040 --> 00:17:39.040]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:45.040]   Right. It seems kind of, if you put some thought into it, you broke it,
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.040]   you're using it for fire, you're cooking off of it, and then with the little piece left over,
[00:17:49.040 --> 00:17:53.040]   you're worshipping it. Right? Again, to illustrate in more detail, like the foolishness.
[00:17:53.040 --> 00:17:58.040]   I mean, it's just, obviously the illustration is like many other illustrations,
[00:17:58.040 --> 00:18:03.040]   but the fact that he went through so much, you know, took so much time to illustrate
[00:18:03.040 --> 00:18:08.040]   the details of it, and you kind of, like, God is revealing to them just how foolish this is.
[00:18:08.040 --> 00:18:11.040]   If you were to just take a step back and look at it, right?
[00:18:11.040 --> 00:18:17.040]   Just for the sake of time, in other words, idols are made by man and not man by idols. Right?
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:25.040]   You made this. Right? God gave you a tree for you to use to cook and whatever,
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:30.040]   and then you turn it around and you make what God has made, and then make idols out of it. Right?
[00:18:30.040 --> 00:18:34.040]   These are, again, these are just some observations that I've made.
[00:18:34.040 --> 00:18:39.040]   A lot of time and effort into making something that does nothing.
[00:18:39.040 --> 00:18:44.040]   And God gave wood to be used for man and not to worship it. Right?
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:55.040]   Again, these are all same points, just said a different way.
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:19:00.040]   I don't know about you, but, you know, if you study through Isaiah, and you see God pleading with Israel
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:06.040]   over and over and over and over again, and we're talking about, even though Isaiah is talking about
[00:19:06.040 --> 00:19:09.040]   a short period of history, we're talking about 200 years of history.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:14.040]   The over 1,000 years of Israel's history was the same thing. Right?
[00:19:14.040 --> 00:19:19.040]   In fact, if you take it even further out, mankind's history, thousands and thousands of years of history
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:24.040]   is the same thing, where God disciplines, and then He comes and He pleads with them for forgiveness,
[00:19:24.040 --> 00:19:29.040]   and then God relents, and then as soon as they're doing okay, they forget,
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   and they become proud, and they forget God over and over, and God is pleading.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:38.040]   And then I look at, like, how many times do you need to give this instruction to these people
[00:19:38.040 --> 00:19:42.040]   before they get it? And how many times do you do this, and then they forget it,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:46.040]   before you say, "That's enough." You know what I mean?
[00:19:46.040 --> 00:19:52.040]   At some point, you would think God would just, His patience would be exhausted,
[00:19:52.040 --> 00:19:56.040]   and it's like, "I can't take this anymore." You know?
[00:19:56.040 --> 00:20:01.040]   And the fact that He's taking this kind of time to go to this kind of detail,
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:05.040]   to show them, plead with them, another generation, the same thing over and over,
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:10.040]   it's just kind of, to me, don't you get frustrated when you read this stuff?
[00:20:10.040 --> 00:20:16.040]   Even though we say, "Wow, God is so merciful and faithful, because we're these people."
[00:20:16.040 --> 00:20:22.040]   But if you were to put yourself in God's position, even just for a minute while you're reading this,
[00:20:22.040 --> 00:20:26.040]   I mean, it's frustrating. Look at Israel's history over and over again,
[00:20:26.040 --> 00:20:33.040]   and yet, again, God is patient because He, through all of this, what is He trying to teach?
[00:20:33.040 --> 00:20:39.040]   You have no hope in yourself. Right? That's really the conclusion that we should come to.
[00:20:39.040 --> 00:20:44.040]   You have no hope. Right? And that's why when Christ comes as a Redeemer,
[00:20:44.040 --> 00:20:48.040]   He is our only hope. And again, as we've been talking about in Romans,
[00:20:48.040 --> 00:20:53.040]   why it can only be by His promise and by His calling. Right?
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:21:00.040]   If you look at Israel's history, this is not just about Israel, this is us. Right?
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:05.040]   Again, this is another application of Christ, I think. No, no, no.
[00:21:05.040 --> 00:21:11.040]   Here's another question. Where He says, in verse 18,
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.040]   "They know not, nor do they discern, for He has shut their eyes so that they cannot see,
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:19.040]   and their hearts so that they cannot understand." So the question was,
[00:21:19.040 --> 00:21:27.040]   if God shut their eyes and hardened their hearts, how can He keep saying it's their fault?
[00:21:27.040 --> 00:21:30.040]   Right? That was the question. How did you guys answer that?
[00:21:30.040 --> 00:21:39.040]   How do you reconcile that when somebody asks you that question?
[00:21:39.040 --> 00:21:47.040]   Let me start calling names. Would that be easier? Yes? Isaac?
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:54.040]   James Hong was tapping him the whole time.
[00:21:54.040 --> 00:21:57.040]   Alright, okay. I didn't mean to put you on the spot. I thought you had something to say,
[00:21:57.040 --> 00:22:03.040]   and that's why he was trying to push you over the edge. So I dragged you.
[00:22:03.040 --> 00:22:12.040]   No, no, no. Don't feel pressure. Unless you want to.
[00:22:12.040 --> 00:22:14.040]   It sounded like you guys had a discussion.
[00:22:14.040 --> 00:22:38.040]   [inaudible]
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.040]   It's interesting, especially when you look at the way God deals with Pharaoh.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:49.040]   God deals with Pharaoh, and He says in three separate times about Pharaoh hardening his heart.
[00:22:49.040 --> 00:22:54.040]   He says it in the active, He says it in the middle, and He says it in the passive.
[00:22:54.040 --> 00:23:00.040]   Meaning that, I'll just put that up here.
[00:23:00.040 --> 00:23:05.040]   Not all from Exodus, but basically in Exodus 4.21, it says the same thing that He says here,
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:11.040]   that God hardened Pharaoh's heart. And then in Exodus 8.15, He says God allowed Pharaoh's heart to be hardened.
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:17.040]   And I forgot to put the other one, where the other one says, Pharaoh hardened his own heart.
[00:23:17.040 --> 00:23:22.040]   Right? So you look at the way God deals with them, it's like all three is mentioned.
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:28.040]   But in the end, I think the summary in Romans 1.18, is a summary of mankind.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.040]   Because they rather have darkness than light, so God gave them over.
[00:23:32.040 --> 00:23:37.040]   So He allowed their hearts to be hardened.
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:43.040]   Does God ever take a man who is repentant and righteous, and He hardens his heart just to condemn him?
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:47.040]   Do you ever see that in the Bible?
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:54.040]   Never. Right? When He says He hardens their heart, He's usually talking about a sinner who refuses to repent.
[00:23:54.040 --> 00:23:58.040]   And He's kind of releasing them to where they're already headed. Right?
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:04.040]   And the Bible makes it very clear. Now, it's hard for us to, again, understand how does God's sovereign work,
[00:24:04.040 --> 00:24:09.040]   with man's ability to choose for himself. Like, we don't know exactly how that works.
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.040]   But clearly the scripture says that God is not the originator of evil. Right?
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:17.040]   God does not take something good and He makes it bad. Right?
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:21.040]   So, when we understand this in the context of rest of scripture,
[00:24:21.040 --> 00:24:25.040]   and then we see it in the context of the way He deals with Pharaoh, right?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:29.040]   There is an active part that what God plays, because He's sovereign.
[00:24:29.040 --> 00:24:33.040]   There is a part where He's just kind of releasing and letting it happen.
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:38.040]   And then there's a part where the recipient is actively hardening these hearts.
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   And all three are mentioned about the same Pharaoh.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:53.040]   And it's another discussion question.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:25:01.040]   Okay, so, again, in the context of God reaffirming to the nation of Israel, right?
[00:25:01.040 --> 00:25:06.040]   Describing in detail all the work of God that we are to sing and worship Him.
[00:25:06.040 --> 00:25:10.040]   So, verse 21 to 28, the people of God break out into songs.
[00:25:10.040 --> 00:25:14.040]   How does each one of these works of God give you confidence to trust and worship Him?
[00:25:14.040 --> 00:25:19.040]   So, all of these things in response to His promises and the things that He's doing.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:27.040]   So, God calls Israel to remember who He is to them in contrast to what idols are that was stated in the previous passage.
[00:25:27.040 --> 00:25:31.040]   So, again, the long illustration that we saw in verse 19 to 20.
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:38.040]   So, now in 21 through 28, in contrast to these worthless idols, who is God, right?
[00:25:38.040 --> 00:25:45.040]   Now, you have a tendency to go to these worthless things that is made to cook fire and to keep warm.
[00:25:45.040 --> 00:25:49.040]   In contrast to that, who am I, right?
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:54.040]   So, He made Israel His servants, verse 21.
[00:25:54.040 --> 00:25:59.040]   He's blotted out their transgressions, verse 22.
[00:25:59.040 --> 00:26:03.040]   And ultimately, because of that, He redeemed them.
[00:26:03.040 --> 00:26:10.040]   So, again, if you read verse 9 through 20, and then 21 to 28, like all in one sitting,
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:13.040]   you can clearly see the contrast that He's making.
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:21.040]   These aren't two separate statements. This is one statement that He's making, and it was meant to kind of be seen side by side.
[00:26:21.040 --> 00:26:26.040]   This is what you are tempted with, and this is who I am.
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:32.040]   So, it's foolish. Worshipping idols is foolish as it is, right?
[00:26:32.040 --> 00:26:36.040]   Even if you're not a worshipper of Yahweh, even if you never knew God,
[00:26:36.040 --> 00:26:40.040]   the fact that you would even depend on the idol, it's foolish.
[00:26:40.040 --> 00:26:44.040]   You make these little items that you can cook, all it is is wood.
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:50.040]   But when you contrast that to Yahweh, you contrast that to who God is and what He has done for them,
[00:26:50.040 --> 00:26:55.040]   then it takes the foolishness to a whole new level.
[00:26:55.040 --> 00:27:04.040]   So, it's just like, again, as Christians, it's one thing to live in sin when you didn't know God,
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:11.040]   but another thing to live in sin in contrast to seeing the glory of God.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:15.040]   And that's why the Bible says the second state is worse than the first.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:20.040]   Because now the sin has even become worse, because before you may have done it in ignorance,
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:24.040]   and it's still foolish to seek after things that are temporary, it means nothing.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:29.040]   But in light of what you have in Christ, and yet you still choose the world,
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:32.040]   the foolishness of that, right?
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   So, again, when you read verse 9 through 28 put together, which was, I think, meant to be read together,
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:47.040]   again, the foolishness of worshipping idols is even that much more hard to understand.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:51.040]   Again, He introduces to us, again, the King Cyrus, right?
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:54.040]   He was a pagan king over Persia, and we talked about that already.
[00:27:54.040 --> 00:27:58.040]   This happened almost about 200 years after Isaiah prophesied.
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   So, again, just as a review, his prophecy begins during the period of Assyrians,
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:10.040]   and he prophesies that the Babylonians are going to come, right?
[00:28:10.040 --> 00:28:14.040]   And then after the Babylonians, the Persians come, and they're going to take over.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:19.040]   So, he's talking about three kingdoms that's going to come, and they're going to conquer,
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:25.040]   and God's using each one of them for what purpose?
[00:28:25.040 --> 00:28:29.040]   What is the central purpose of, according to Isaiah, of the Assyrian kingdom,
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:39.040]   of the Babylonian kingdom, and of the Persian kingdom?
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:43.040]   His focal point is Israel, right? According to Isaiah.
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:46.040]   I mean, imagine hearing that at that time.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:57.040]   What is, you know, what's a tiny little country that no one will be offended if I mentioned it today?
[00:28:57.040 --> 00:29:02.040]   I mean, just imagine. Imagine a country that you would never think of.
[00:29:02.040 --> 00:29:05.040]   They're not wealthy. They don't have any political power.
[00:29:05.040 --> 00:29:08.040]   It's not a country that would have any kind of say in the UN.
[00:29:08.040 --> 00:29:12.040]   You know what I mean? Like, just some obscure little place.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:19.040]   And to say that US, Russia, China are all being played out for that little country.
[00:29:19.040 --> 00:29:24.040]   Right? I mean, think how ridiculous that may have sounded at that time.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:28.040]   That's exactly what Isaiah is saying. Isaiah is a prophet from a tiny little nation
[00:29:28.040 --> 00:29:32.040]   that's being conquered and is clinging to Egypt, clinging to…
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:35.040]   And little Philistines are coming and kicking their butt.
[00:29:35.040 --> 00:29:42.040]   And then Isaiah is saying, "Our sovereign God is wielding the Nebuchadnezzar and Cyrus and the Assyrians,
[00:29:42.040 --> 00:29:47.040]   and these guys are nothing. God is wielding them for His glory,
[00:29:47.040 --> 00:29:51.040]   and ultimately He's going to bring a descendant."
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:55.040]   So, imagine hearing that at that time. It's like, "Are you kidding me?"
[00:29:55.040 --> 00:29:59.040]   Right? You would think that something great is happening in Assyria.
[00:29:59.040 --> 00:30:03.040]   Something great is happening in Babylon or Persia.
[00:30:03.040 --> 00:30:09.040]   Only in retrospect, we look back at it now, and we see Christ, and because of what Christ has done,
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:14.040]   we look at who made a bigger impact in human history.
[00:30:14.040 --> 00:30:20.040]   Cyrus? Assyria? Babylonians?
[00:30:20.040 --> 00:30:24.040]   Nobody compares to what happened when Christ came. Right?
[00:30:24.040 --> 00:30:28.040]   In retrospect, 2,000 years later, we look at it now, all those kingdoms,
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:32.040]   like what Isaiah is saying, actually makes sense now. Right?
[00:30:32.040 --> 00:30:35.040]   Can you imagine at that time if you heard that?
[00:30:35.040 --> 00:30:38.040]   A tiny little nation that was a speck, it meant nothing to say,
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:43.040]   "All of this has happened because of this country." Right?
[00:30:43.040 --> 00:30:47.040]   But we have the benefit of looking back at that and say, "Wow!"
[00:30:47.040 --> 00:30:52.040]   Like, what Isaiah said actually happened. Right?
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:54.040]   Who would ever even possibly imagine?
[00:30:54.040 --> 00:30:58.040]   You would be saying that the earth is going to turn the other direction for a while.
[00:30:58.040 --> 00:31:01.040]   You know, it would be that crazy. Right?
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:05.040]   What an arrogant thing to say. Unless it was real.
[00:31:05.040 --> 00:31:09.040]   Which obviously now we have a retrospect, we can look at that and say, "It's real." Right?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.040]   This is why the secular people have such a hard time with Isaiah,
[00:31:13.040 --> 00:31:17.040]   because how could Isaiah possibly have known this? Right?
[00:31:17.040 --> 00:31:21.040]   How could Isaiah even know? They have a hard time even saying,
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:25.040]   "How could he have known this guy, the king of Persia, was going to be Cyrus,
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:29.040]   and that he was going to send Israel back to rebuild the temple and all that stuff?"
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.040]   How could he have possibly known that? Right?
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.040]   But it's just crazy when you really think about it, like when this was written,
[00:31:36.040 --> 00:31:39.040]   and then now we're looking back, and this actually happened. Right?
[00:31:39.040 --> 00:31:42.040]   Just like he said.
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:49.040]   Cyrus was the pagan king over Persia, and yet God calls him the "anointed one." Right?
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:52.040]   Was he a worshipper of Yahweh?
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:55.040]   He was not. He was a pagan king. And yet God said he anointed.
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:58.040]   Even this pagan king is under his rule. Right?
[00:31:58.040 --> 00:32:06.040]   God uses Cyrus as his shepherd, because the shepherds of Israel were not leading or feeding. Right?
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:13.040]   Leading his people, but only taking advantage of them.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:17.040]   God is sovereign over history, therefore God is sovereign over those who have any authority.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:21.040]   Again, Romans 13.1. Right? Perfect example of that.
[00:32:21.040 --> 00:32:29.040]   Again, if you were a Jew, or early Christian, and then when he heard from Paul,
[00:32:29.040 --> 00:32:32.040]   and he says, "Submit yourself to the authority, all authority,"
[00:32:32.040 --> 00:32:37.040]   because all authority is established by who? By God.
[00:32:37.040 --> 00:32:41.040]   So if you were a Christian or a Jew at that particular time, to think like,
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:44.040]   "Wow, Caesar is under God's control?"
[00:32:44.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   It would be hard to believe. Right?
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:51.040]   Hard to even fathom. Really? Like God is really sovereignly in control?
[00:32:51.040 --> 00:33:00.040]   But when you look at what happens in the prophecies of Isaiah, that's exactly what happens. Right?
[00:33:00.040 --> 00:33:07.040]   This is why, you know, when he says, "God makes promises, and he does not change." Right?
[00:33:07.040 --> 00:33:09.040]   You can bank on his promise.
[00:33:09.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   And there's illustration after illustration throughout Scripture, throughout church history,
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:19.040]   throughout human history, where God, we can clearly see. Right?
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:25.040]   We're the ones short-sighted, because if I can't, if it doesn't make sense in my head, right?
[00:33:25.040 --> 00:33:27.040]   Like, I can't possibly see this happening.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:35.040]   Even the way we pray, if you think about it, we tend to pray for things that we think are possible. Right?
[00:33:35.040 --> 00:33:41.040]   We kind of pray for miracles just kind of on the side. Right?
[00:33:41.040 --> 00:33:47.040]   No? Yeah. I remember somebody pointed that out to me years ago, when I went to China for the first time.
[00:33:47.040 --> 00:33:53.040]   This lady was like a prayer warrior, and she went into, she was planning to go into China.
[00:33:53.040 --> 00:33:55.040]   And this is when China was completely closed.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:01.040]   And she would pray, she probably fasted like maybe once every three or four days.
[00:34:01.040 --> 00:34:04.040]   Like, just for breakfast time.
[00:34:04.040 --> 00:34:08.040]   So, one of the most diligent prayer warriors that I've ever met,
[00:34:08.040 --> 00:34:11.040]   and one of the things that she said to me that really stuck with me ever since,
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:15.040]   was as I was praying with her, and then after I prayed, she said,
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:19.040]   "Peter, you know, you're always praying defensively. Right?
[00:34:19.040 --> 00:34:23.040]   You're always praying for protection, you're praying for health, you're praying for all this stuff,
[00:34:23.040 --> 00:34:31.040]   but, you know, pray in faith. Right? Pray knowing who you're praying to. Right?
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:35.040]   This is a, the God that you're praying to is God.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:41.040]   And so, you're, even in the way that you pray, and what you pray kind of shows what you believe about God."
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:45.040]   And I remember her saying that, like, "Yeah, it's like so true.
[00:34:45.040 --> 00:34:48.040]   This lady is like a prayer warrior. She knows what she's talking about."
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:54.040]   That's probably one of the most significant things that I learned about prayer through somebody.
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:57.040]   But again, like, we have a tendency to be short-sighted.
[00:34:57.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   So, when you see, you know, often times when you study the Bible, and you see things like this,
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:03.040]   like, God's seeing from this perspective.
[00:35:03.040 --> 00:35:06.040]   And He's trying to, that's why He keeps mentioning over and over,
[00:35:06.040 --> 00:35:12.040]   "I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, because the God that they worship,
[00:35:12.040 --> 00:35:16.040]   the miracles that I perform with them, I'm that God. Right?
[00:35:16.040 --> 00:35:22.040]   I'm the one who delivered Israel. I'm the one who conquered the Syrians and the Babylonians."
[00:35:22.040 --> 00:35:28.040]   So, all of this to kind of show them who He is, so that we can have confidence in who He is.
[00:35:28.040 --> 00:35:33.040]   Right? Not just in what we see. Right?
[00:35:33.040 --> 00:35:37.040]   All right. Verse 4 says, "God names him Cyrus again,
[00:35:37.040 --> 00:35:43.040]   that he would actually even equip you through, though you do not know me." Right?
[00:35:43.040 --> 00:35:48.040]   Remember, Jesus says that, you know, when the Pharisees,
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:50.040]   "Stop telling your disciples to praise you."
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:55.040]   And He said, "If they don't praise me, then these rocks will cry out." Right?
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:35:59.040]   The God could use even, don't you, you can't see it?
[00:35:59.040 --> 00:36:02.040]   [Audience] Um, I think prophesied.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:05.040]   [Audience] What? Isaiah.
[00:36:05.040 --> 00:36:12.040]   Here? Yeah, Isaiah prophesied.
[00:36:12.040 --> 00:36:16.040]   I forgot. Nothing below this line.
[00:36:16.040 --> 00:36:20.040]   You can see clearly up to here, right?
[00:36:20.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   Oh, it's because of the pulpit?
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:34.040]   So, how does God reveal Himself to Cyrus in verse 5 to 7?
[00:36:34.040 --> 00:36:37.040]   God will show Himself to be sovereign over human history.
[00:36:37.040 --> 00:36:42.040]   In other words, He's going to reveal Himself through Cyrus, that He is Cyrus.
[00:36:42.040 --> 00:36:44.040]   He is sovereign. Right?
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:50.040]   So, you know how it mentions in verse 5?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:37:01.040]   5 and 7. Or is it 46? Oops.
[00:37:01.040 --> 00:37:04.040]   So, He says, "I am the Lord, and there is no other besides Me.
[00:37:04.040 --> 00:37:07.040]   There is no God. I equip you, though you do not know Me,
[00:37:07.040 --> 00:37:10.040]   that My people may know from the rising of the sun and from the west
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.040]   that there is none beside Me. I am the Lord, there is no other.
[00:37:13.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   I form light and create darkness. I make well-being and create calamity.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:21.040]   I am the Lord who does all things."
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:27.040]   So, again, part of this is in direct refute of the God of the Persians.
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:32.040]   They had two categories of gods. The gods of darkness and the god of light.
[00:37:32.040 --> 00:37:37.040]   And so, when He says that He's the God of calamity, good or bad, He's sovereign.
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:42.040]   Right? So, again, in essence, He's revealing Himself to Israel
[00:37:42.040 --> 00:37:48.040]   and also to Cyrus, who the true God is.
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:52.040]   So, in other words, God is not only in control when you see the blessing
[00:37:52.040 --> 00:37:55.040]   and good things, and God seems to be answering prayer.
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:38:00.040]   Right? Just like Job. Even in his darkest moment, God had never lost control.
[00:38:00.040 --> 00:38:04.040]   All of that was happening because God allowed it. Right?
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:11.040]   So, is there anything that happens in your life and my life that God has no control over?
[00:38:11.040 --> 00:38:17.040]   Right? No. God is absolutely sovereign. Right?
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:21.040]   Sometimes God may be allowing it to happen, but God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.040]   So, that's the part why we get anxious. Right?
[00:38:25.040 --> 00:38:30.040]   We get anxious over things because things are out of our control.
[00:38:30.040 --> 00:38:34.040]   We are hoping and planning certain things, and we want certain things to happen,
[00:38:34.040 --> 00:38:37.040]   the results aren't happening the way we want, whatever it may be, and we get anxious.
[00:38:37.040 --> 00:38:43.040]   So, anxiousness comes when we feel like things that I have control over are slipping out of my hands.
[00:38:43.040 --> 00:38:46.040]   But this is a reminder that God is in absolute control.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:50.040]   That's why He says, "Be anxious for nothing," right?
[00:38:50.040 --> 00:38:53.040]   But to pray, right? With thanksgiving.
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:58.040]   "At your request, be made known to God, and the peace of God, which surpasses human understanding,
[00:38:58.040 --> 00:39:01.040]   will guard your hearts and mind in Christ Jesus." Right?
[00:39:01.040 --> 00:39:08.040]   So, that's basically what it's saying. He is sovereign over all. Good and a bad. Right?
[00:39:08.040 --> 00:39:14.040]   A person or a nation resisting God is like a pot contending with the potter. Right?
[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:23.040]   In other words, God is in the context of accomplishing His work. Right?
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:28.040]   He may be in the context of burning it down. Right?
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:32.040]   Maybe the pot's not formed correctly. Maybe the handle is in the wrong place.
[00:39:32.040 --> 00:39:38.040]   Maybe the reason why all this stuff is happening, a lot of times, is just to break us down.
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:42.040]   Because until we're broken, we can't be molded. Right?
[00:39:42.040 --> 00:39:46.040]   But whatever it is, to come before God to complain for anything,
[00:39:46.040 --> 00:39:53.040]   is like complaining to the potter and saying, "Hey, hey, hey. You don't know what you're doing." Right?
[00:39:53.040 --> 00:39:57.040]   So that's how He describes it. Right?
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:40:08.040]   Unbelief, basically, is contending with God and saying, "No, you're not making the pot correctly."
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:15.040]   I think the greatest time of sanctification always is when you're hurt. Right?
[00:40:15.040 --> 00:40:20.040]   When you're broken. And God really humbles you.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:25.040]   Humbles your pride, any kind of confidence that you had in the past,
[00:40:25.040 --> 00:40:29.040]   whatever it is, security that you're holding on to, God kind of yanks that out of your hand.
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:34.040]   And then you're kind of like broken, you're hurt, maybe you're angry, you're in despair,
[00:40:34.040 --> 00:40:41.040]   maybe even unbelief, you know. And God brings you to that point because He's trying to mold you into something.
[00:40:41.040 --> 00:40:45.040]   Like clay that's hard can't be molded.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:53.040]   And it tends to be like when God is really working to sanctify you, reaching into a place maybe that you've hidden for so long,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:41:00.040]   that usually when God wants to go in there and do something, it hurts. Right?
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:03.040]   The deeper it is, the more it's going to hurt.
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:09.040]   But He said God does that to build, ultimately, His people, His children.
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:14.040]   And He says, "Ask of Me the things to come concerning My children and the works of My hands."
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:19.040]   So we are not able to see the big picture because we only know what is. Right?
[00:41:19.040 --> 00:41:30.040]   We only see what is. That is why He says to come and ask of Me, to search Me.
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:38.040]   That's why I think it's always good to be connected with saints that have gone before us. Right?
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:44.040]   A lot of times hearing the struggles and the trials of people who've gone the previous generation.
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   You know, again, I think especially in the Western generation, like because we value youth,
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:52.040]   and we have a tendency that all movement happens with the youth.
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:58.040]   When's the last time you saw a 60-year-old, you know, in the head of some kind of movement?
[00:41:58.040 --> 00:42:05.040]   You know? Not in the Western culture, because the Western culture usually wants new innovations.
[00:42:05.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   Anything new, young, vibrant.
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:14.040]   But I think that what we miss from that is the wisdom that comes from people who've lived a long period of time.
[00:42:14.040 --> 00:42:20.040]   You know? There's a lot of things to gain from the previous generation. Right?
[00:42:20.040 --> 00:42:27.040]   Because we're so short-sighted. And being young, we're even more short-sighted because we don't see the bigger picture. Right?
[00:42:27.040 --> 00:42:35.040]   So, the danger that I caution all of us, all of you, is that because you're surrounded by even younger people.
[00:42:35.040 --> 00:42:38.040]   I mean, you're young, but you're surrounded by even younger people.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:47.040]   And so you start having a mentality, "I'm an old man at the age of 30." Right? Or age of 35. Right?
[00:42:47.040 --> 00:42:55.040]   And so when you start having that kind of mentality, where you become the teacher too early, you stop learning. Right?
[00:42:55.040 --> 00:42:58.040]   You stop asking. Right? You put on that hat.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:04.040]   And I think that's why becoming a pastor, becoming a leader, it actually is hurtful.
[00:43:04.040 --> 00:43:09.040]   Because it's hard to learn. Because you're always putting on that hat to teach people. Right?
[00:43:09.040 --> 00:43:13.040]   Again, this is kind of sidetracked, but I think there's a danger.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:16.040]   Like, because he keeps saying, "Ask of me." Right?
[00:43:16.040 --> 00:43:24.040]   So, I think the wisdom would cause ourselves to see how short-sighted we are, and constantly seeing the bigger picture.
[00:43:24.040 --> 00:43:29.040]   And obviously, we go to God, but there's people who have gone before us. Right?
[00:43:29.040 --> 00:43:37.040]   So, I love talking to older pastors who've been in ministry longer, you know, and the things that they say, the observations that they had.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   And because it helps me to see my current situation a lot better. Right?
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:45.040]   So, again, in the larger scale of things, you see what God is doing.
[00:43:45.040 --> 00:43:49.040]   Like, why is God doing this in your life? Because there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:43:49.040 --> 00:43:55.040]   Everything that you've been feeling, every conflict and every struggle that you have, somebody has struggled with it before.
[00:43:55.040 --> 00:43:59.040]   Some generation was wrestling with that same thing before. Right?
[00:43:59.040 --> 00:44:06.040]   And yet, God is sovereign.
[00:44:06.040 --> 00:44:09.040]   And what effect will Israel's deliverance have among the Gentiles?
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:14.040]   So, here, you know, it talks about how Israel is delivered. Right?
[00:44:14.040 --> 00:44:18.040]   The nations that Israel had to submit to will come and bow down to Israel.
[00:44:18.040 --> 00:44:26.040]   So, in other words, Israel's deliverance means deliverance for who?
[00:44:26.040 --> 00:44:31.040]   Oops. Israel's deliverance means deliverance for who?
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:34.040]   To the nations. Right?
[00:44:34.040 --> 00:44:39.040]   So, you can read all of this and say, "Oh, God only cares about Israel." Right?
[00:44:39.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   It was never just about Israel.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:49.040]   He said, "His plan is that through Israel, He's going to bless the nations." Right?
[00:44:49.040 --> 00:44:55.040]   That was His intention always.
[00:44:55.040 --> 00:45:01.040]   Again, because we're short-sighted, so we only see, like, "Oh, God loves Israel. God only chose Israel."
[00:45:01.040 --> 00:45:09.040]   But when you look at the larger picture, like what God is doing in history, that He's the beginning and the end, Alpha and Omega.
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:19.040]   It's always been about mankind. He just happens to be, like, the plan that He's going to carry this out is through the nation of Israel. Right?
[00:45:19.040 --> 00:45:24.040]   God not only created the world, He said everyone in it, He created.
[00:45:24.040 --> 00:45:36.040]   He did nothing in secret. Verse 18 and 19.
[00:45:36.040 --> 00:45:47.040]   Okay. Alright. So, you know, again, as we wrap up, one of the things that I think clear theme that keeps coming up over and over again is God's big picture.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:52.040]   Why is He pursuing Israel to this extent? Right?
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:57.040]   It's not just about Israel. He's pursuing mankind.
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:46:00.040]   He's pursuing us. Right?
[00:46:00.040 --> 00:46:05.040]   His patience with Israel is because He's being patient with us.
[00:46:05.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   Because the Messiah is coming through that line. Salvation is going to come through that line. Right?
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:18.040]   So all of this is, again, is God patient towards sinners to save us.
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:23.040]   Alright. So if you guys can take some time with your small group.
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:42.040]   Oh, sorry. Chapter 46, 8, 9, and 10.
[00:46:42.040 --> 00:46:45.040]   So it's three verses. It's a bit longer than normal.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:53.040]   Okay. Chapter 46, 8, 9, and 10. Okay.
