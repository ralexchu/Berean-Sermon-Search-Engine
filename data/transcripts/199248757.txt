[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - All right, I want to start off with a,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:10.960]   just a discussion really fast,
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:12.880]   and I'm gonna give you guys just two to three minutes
[00:00:12.880 --> 00:00:14.500]   to talk about this, okay?
[00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:18.040]   There is the dilemma in our lives,
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:22.140]   and that dilemma is suffering and hardship, okay?
[00:00:22.140 --> 00:00:25.840]   That problem that everybody faces, you know,
[00:00:25.840 --> 00:00:27.480]   Solomon says everybody under the sun
[00:00:27.480 --> 00:00:30.480]   is going to go through toiling, he says, you know?
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:32.320]   Hardship in their lives,
[00:00:32.320 --> 00:00:35.400]   and he sees it as like unavoidable, right?
[00:00:35.400 --> 00:00:38.600]   Now, there's a question of why that happens, okay?
[00:00:38.600 --> 00:00:41.320]   So, really quickly, if you guys would,
[00:00:41.320 --> 00:00:42.560]   just look to each other,
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.040]   and some of the answers are obvious,
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:46.120]   some of the answers can be a little bit more,
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:47.680]   you know, deep or whatnot,
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:49.720]   but just kind of go around and throw at each other
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:53.200]   a couple reasons as to why suffering happens in our lives.
[00:00:53.200 --> 00:00:54.040]   Ready, go.
[00:00:54.980 --> 00:00:57.900]   (audience chatter)
[00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:00.900]   (audience laughter)
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.900]   (audience laughter)
[00:01:04.900 --> 00:01:07.900]   (audience laughter)
[00:01:07.900 --> 00:01:10.820]   (audience chatter)
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:13.740]   (audience chatter)
[00:01:13.740 --> 00:01:32.660]   (audience chatter)
[00:01:32.660 --> 00:01:35.580]   (audience chatter)
[00:01:35.580 --> 00:01:57.580]   (audience laughter)
[00:01:57.580 --> 00:02:00.580]   (audience chatter)
[00:02:00.580 --> 00:02:17.580]   (audience laughter)
[00:02:24.580 --> 00:02:27.580]   (audience chatter)
[00:02:27.580 --> 00:02:34.580]   (audience laughter)
[00:02:34.580 --> 00:02:52.580]   Okay, so, sounds like you guys,
[00:02:52.580 --> 00:02:53.660]   I know that was really short,
[00:02:53.660 --> 00:02:55.700]   and I know it was a really broad question,
[00:02:55.700 --> 00:02:57.780]   but just real quick, just raise your hand,
[00:02:57.780 --> 00:03:00.500]   and please share what you guys mentioned
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:02.500]   as reason as to why there's suffering.
[00:03:02.500 --> 00:03:04.660]   Oh, I thought that was a hand,
[00:03:04.660 --> 00:03:06.580]   but someone was just fixing their hair.
[00:03:06.580 --> 00:03:10.940]   Or how about, let's see,
[00:03:10.940 --> 00:03:14.300]   table on the far right with Andy.
[00:03:14.300 --> 00:03:21.480]   Discipline, God is disciplining.
[00:03:21.480 --> 00:03:22.320]   What else?
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:27.200]   How about table right in front of me with John?
[00:03:27.200 --> 00:03:32.580]   To test our faith, okay?
[00:03:32.580 --> 00:03:36.360]   How about ladies to the far left, Diane?
[00:03:36.360 --> 00:03:37.400]   Sin, okay?
[00:03:37.400 --> 00:03:41.040]   Good, so, in terms of just,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:43.880]   these are just obvious things that happen in our lives,
[00:03:43.880 --> 00:03:46.920]   and so, there's a sense to which,
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:48.920]   with just simply those reasons,
[00:03:48.920 --> 00:03:51.840]   the reason that God could be working behind the scenes,
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:54.040]   God could be disciplining us for our sins,
[00:03:54.040 --> 00:03:55.960]   I'm surprised no one just said because we're fools,
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.120]   and like, we just do silly things,
[00:03:58.120 --> 00:04:01.000]   we can expect that there's going to be suffering, okay?
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:02.920]   Now, in your packet, I asked you this question.
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:05.000]   On top of what's to be expected,
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.680]   which is suffering and hardship in our lives,
[00:04:07.680 --> 00:04:11.960]   we as Christians have a cherry on top, so to speak.
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:14.360]   We can expect, actually, above and beyond the suffering
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:16.580]   that everybody in this life goes through,
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:18.880]   we can expect more, right?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.100]   Why?
[00:04:20.100 --> 00:04:24.640]   Because we as Christians often go through persecution.
[00:04:24.640 --> 00:04:26.440]   Now, we asked a question,
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:28.280]   and I don't know if you guys ever asked a question,
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:30.880]   or thought about this,
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.380]   why are Christians persecuted, you know?
[00:04:34.380 --> 00:04:35.420]   I remember sitting there thinking,
[00:04:35.420 --> 00:04:36.680]   as a younger Christian one time,
[00:04:36.680 --> 00:04:38.400]   like, it doesn't make sense to me.
[00:04:38.400 --> 00:04:41.080]   Christians are, by conviction,
[00:04:41.080 --> 00:04:45.000]   like, by doctrine, supposed to be the most loving,
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   kind, and gracious people ever,
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:48.560]   and forgiving as well.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:50.940]   Why is it that the world continues to hate?
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:52.060]   Why is it that the world continues
[00:04:52.060 --> 00:04:54.280]   to persecute Christians, right?
[00:04:54.280 --> 00:04:58.780]   And we realize there's a lot of reasons for that, too.
[00:04:58.780 --> 00:05:02.480]   Whether it's just a clash of truth,
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:04.940]   whether it's because we have an enemy,
[00:05:04.940 --> 00:05:08.440]   we have an enemy who is constantly trying to attack us,
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:10.920]   whether it's because, you know what scripture says sometimes
[00:05:10.920 --> 00:05:13.980]   is that when Christians talk about their peace,
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:15.300]   talk about their purity,
[00:05:15.300 --> 00:05:17.640]   talk about how God has changed them,
[00:05:17.640 --> 00:05:21.180]   there's a sense in which the dark, perverse world
[00:05:21.180 --> 00:05:22.460]   is jealous of that.
[00:05:22.460 --> 00:05:26.240]   Or, our light continues to expose them,
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:27.760]   and for that reason alone,
[00:05:27.760 --> 00:05:30.100]   they will continue to hate on Christians.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.520]   So, my point with these series of questions
[00:05:33.520 --> 00:05:35.960]   is to just kind of say to us,
[00:05:35.960 --> 00:05:38.400]   there is the commonality for all, man,
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.900]   that we're gonna have hardship and suffering.
[00:05:40.900 --> 00:05:42.720]   But for you as a Christian,
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:47.560]   you can actually expect not less hardship and pain,
[00:05:47.560 --> 00:05:49.240]   but rather more.
[00:05:49.240 --> 00:05:51.680]   And what the scripture teaches us
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:54.300]   is that we are going to constantly experience
[00:05:54.300 --> 00:05:57.740]   opposition, rejection, scorn, contempt,
[00:05:57.740 --> 00:05:59.880]   and maybe even martyrdom.
[00:05:59.880 --> 00:06:03.420]   And Jesus was the one who taught his disciples,
[00:06:03.420 --> 00:06:05.840]   a disciple, you know, a pupil, a slave,
[00:06:05.840 --> 00:06:08.280]   or anybody who is in a lowly position
[00:06:08.280 --> 00:06:10.200]   is not above his master.
[00:06:10.200 --> 00:06:12.940]   And if they treated the master like this,
[00:06:12.940 --> 00:06:17.400]   attributing Christ to satanic works,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:20.080]   what do you think is going to happen to you?
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:23.720]   And then Apostle Paul said it very, very explicitly,
[00:06:23.720 --> 00:06:27.060]   this comes from 2 Timothy 3, verse 12,
[00:06:27.060 --> 00:06:31.240]   "Indeed, all who desire to live a godly life in Christ,
[00:06:31.240 --> 00:06:34.840]   "Jesus, will be persecuted."
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.400]   That's as clear and explicit as you can get.
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.760]   What you can expect and anticipate for your life
[00:06:43.760 --> 00:06:46.440]   is that on top of just simple hardship,
[00:06:46.440 --> 00:06:48.040]   and the commonalities of, you know,
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:50.720]   whether it's lack of health, lack of money,
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:53.760]   lack of freedom, lack of whatever it may be,
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:57.360]   you're going to also expect persecution in your life.
[00:06:57.360 --> 00:07:01.440]   Now my question is, is that what we actually expect,
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:04.320]   or are we absolutely surprised whenever there's hardship?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:05.720]   What's going on?
[00:07:05.720 --> 00:07:08.080]   You know?
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.280]   Are we crumbling because certain things happen
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:12.440]   and we feel ostracized, and maybe all of a sudden
[00:07:12.440 --> 00:07:14.000]   we feel lonely because of our faith,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:16.640]   and then our worldview is shattered
[00:07:16.640 --> 00:07:19.800]   and we start questioning, what is God doing?
[00:07:19.800 --> 00:07:21.100]   Why?
[00:07:21.100 --> 00:07:21.940]   You know?
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:25.760]   That's a sobering question for us, is it not?
[00:07:25.760 --> 00:07:30.240]   What was our expectation, just worldview-wise,
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:33.800]   in terms of what to anticipate as we live our lives?
[00:07:33.800 --> 00:07:36.880]   And that's something that this book, 1 Peter,
[00:07:36.880 --> 00:07:38.400]   actually challenges us on.
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:43.280]   Because Apostle Peter is speaking to
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.320]   a body of believers, not in one specific congregation,
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:50.080]   but broadly, to the many Christians
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:53.080]   who are experiencing suffering and hardship.
[00:07:53.080 --> 00:07:55.120]   Apostle Peter is gonna address them,
[00:07:55.120 --> 00:07:57.000]   and he's gonna minister to them.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.480]   Now there's a question, how is Apostle Peter
[00:07:59.480 --> 00:08:01.080]   going to encourage these individuals
[00:08:01.080 --> 00:08:03.240]   who are not just simply suffering,
[00:08:03.240 --> 00:08:05.440]   but actually being persecuted?
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:06.280]   You know?
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.920]   I'm pretty sure that in this room,
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:10.960]   that if we, you know, kinda tally,
[00:08:10.960 --> 00:08:14.140]   or make a list of all the experiences that we had,
[00:08:14.140 --> 00:08:16.640]   I'm pretty sure we can make a really extensive list
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.560]   of the different kinds of sufferings you've experienced.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:23.160]   Because, again, I know that from your personal experiences,
[00:08:23.160 --> 00:08:26.800]   maybe, whether it was relationships and broken family,
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.180]   whether it was, you know, health issues,
[00:08:29.180 --> 00:08:30.640]   or whether it was financial issues,
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:33.700]   I know that we've experienced a lot of suffering.
[00:08:33.700 --> 00:08:35.680]   But, on top of the suffering,
[00:08:35.680 --> 00:08:37.480]   the people that Apostle Peter is talking to
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:41.120]   are people who are being intentionally persecuted,
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:43.800]   and intensely persecuted.
[00:08:43.800 --> 00:08:46.500]   How is Apostle Paul going to strengthen them?
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:47.520]   Sorry, Apostle Peter.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.000]   How is Apostle Peter going to encourage them,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:52.520]   and give them hope?
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:53.480]   That's what we're looking at
[00:08:53.480 --> 00:08:56.400]   when we look at 1 Peter, okay?
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.760]   Well, let's take a look at the passage,
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:02.880]   and let's take our Bibles out and go to 1 Peter.
[00:09:06.840 --> 00:09:09.000]   We're looking at 1 Peter, chapter one.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Today, we're gonna take a look at verses one through six.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.960]   Okay, here we go.
[00:09:18.960 --> 00:09:20.860]   And let's take a look at that passage.
[00:09:20.860 --> 00:09:22.960]   I'm sorry.
[00:09:22.960 --> 00:09:29.200]   Okay.
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:35.000]   All right.
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.480]   So it says, "Peter, an apostle to Jesus Christ,
[00:09:39.480 --> 00:09:41.400]   "to those who reside as aliens
[00:09:41.400 --> 00:09:43.420]   "scattered throughout Pontius Galatia,
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:46.340]   "Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia,
[00:09:46.340 --> 00:09:49.120]   "who are chosen according to the foreknowledge
[00:09:49.120 --> 00:09:53.020]   "of God the Father, by the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:56.720]   "to obey Jesus Christ, and be sprinkled with his blood.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:10:00.100]   "May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.
[00:10:00.100 --> 00:10:02.840]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:10:02.840 --> 00:10:05.100]   "who according to his great mercy
[00:10:05.100 --> 00:10:07.800]   "has caused us to be born again to a living hope,
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:10.940]   "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.740]   "to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable,
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:16.200]   "and undefiled, and will not fade away,
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:18.320]   "reserved in heaven for you,
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:20.500]   "who are protected by the power of God
[00:10:20.500 --> 00:10:22.040]   "through faith for a salvation,
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.740]   "ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.060]   "In this, you greatly rejoice,
[00:10:27.060 --> 00:10:29.680]   "even though now for a little while, if necessary,
[00:10:29.680 --> 00:10:32.720]   "you have been distressed by various trials."
[00:10:32.720 --> 00:10:33.740]   Amen.
[00:10:33.740 --> 00:10:35.900]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:40.900]   Lord, as we take a time to look into your word,
[00:10:40.900 --> 00:10:46.380]   Father, help us, God, to see and observe
[00:10:46.380 --> 00:10:51.380]   just your truth, and that by the Spirit we'll be convicted.
[00:10:51.380 --> 00:10:53.680]   Lord, if there's anything in our hearts
[00:10:53.680 --> 00:10:56.740]   that's preventing us, that's a hurdle to your Spirit
[00:10:56.740 --> 00:10:59.380]   working in our lives, I ask that by the power
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:01.880]   of your Spirit, you would cleanse us of those things.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:04.020]   And God, would you give us just a surrendered heart
[00:11:04.020 --> 00:11:05.940]   and spirit and attitude, that Lord,
[00:11:05.940 --> 00:11:07.540]   we would lay those things aside.
[00:11:07.540 --> 00:11:09.660]   Lord, we thank you for this time, it's in Christ's name.
[00:11:09.660 --> 00:11:10.580]   Amen.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:11.820]   Okay.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:16.680]   So, let's take a look at the first section here.
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.660]   So I've kinda divided the section by section for us.
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.660]   And we're looking at this.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.420]   Peter, an apostle of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:29.340]   Now, going pretty slowly, we're just looking at
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:31.880]   an introduction where he addresses them
[00:11:31.880 --> 00:11:35.720]   and gives an introduction identifying himself.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.760]   Now, we could just, if you're reading your Bibles,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.360]   you could just read it and go on to the next part.
[00:11:40.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   But, I would highly encourage that whenever
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:46.560]   we do Bible study, you ask good questions.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.040]   Even if it's something as plain Jane as this.
[00:11:50.040 --> 00:11:51.040]   Well, what I mean by that is,
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:52.920]   here are some questions we could ask.
[00:11:52.920 --> 00:11:55.120]   First question, who is an apostle?
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.200]   Now, if you guys have been with the church a long time,
[00:11:59.200 --> 00:12:02.300]   Pastor Peter, I was about to call him Apostle Peter.
[00:12:02.300 --> 00:12:03.820]   Pastor Peter, our pastor,
[00:12:03.820 --> 00:12:07.220]   one time gave a long series about the credentials
[00:12:07.220 --> 00:12:08.520]   of being an apostle.
[00:12:08.520 --> 00:12:11.740]   Who are apostles and who are not?
[00:12:11.740 --> 00:12:12.860]   How do you identify them?
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:15.000]   Can anybody call themselves an apostle?
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:16.740]   You do realize that there are people today
[00:12:16.740 --> 00:12:18.420]   who call themselves apostles.
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.660]   Is that legit?
[00:12:19.660 --> 00:12:22.020]   Or is that like, that's crazy?
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:23.740]   What is that?
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.460]   We could ask the question, so you guys can jot
[00:12:25.460 --> 00:12:26.880]   some of these questions down.
[00:12:26.880 --> 00:12:28.860]   We could ask the question, what makes them different
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:31.060]   from normal disciples?
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:32.540]   Do they have certain privileges?
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:34.240]   Do they have certain authorities?
[00:12:34.240 --> 00:12:37.600]   That's something important to answer.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.060]   And do you actually, my question to you is,
[00:12:40.060 --> 00:12:42.160]   do you know the answer to these questions?
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.540]   Another question you can ask is,
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:46.700]   what is the general attitude towards an apostle
[00:12:46.700 --> 00:12:48.660]   among the intended audience?
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.900]   Like, you can just say, oh, you know, Apostle Peter.
[00:12:50.900 --> 00:12:53.500]   Well, at that time, you do realize they didn't have
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:57.580]   a long history of like, you know, apostles from Christ
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:59.460]   and then everybody knew automatically
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:02.220]   what that was all about, right?
[00:13:02.220 --> 00:13:04.520]   So you gotta ask some of these questions.
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:07.060]   So real quickly, we don't have to answer
[00:13:07.060 --> 00:13:10.860]   all of these questions, but let's have audience
[00:13:10.860 --> 00:13:14.460]   participation and somebody kinda say, you know,
[00:13:14.460 --> 00:13:16.980]   on a general gist, when Apostle Peter says,
[00:13:16.980 --> 00:13:18.860]   I'm the apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:13:18.860 --> 00:13:21.360]   what kinda weight does that carry for this letter?
[00:13:26.700 --> 00:13:28.900]   Someone bold, let's answer.
[00:13:28.900 --> 00:13:37.060]   How about this?
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:39.500]   All right, let's just move forward.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:41.740]   (laughing)
[00:13:41.740 --> 00:13:44.580]   Okay, oh yes.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.420]   Thank you.
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:50.780]   - So, Apostle is someone that Jesus hand-picked
[00:13:50.780 --> 00:13:52.540]   - Okay. - To be a witness.
[00:13:52.540 --> 00:13:55.780]   - Excellent.
[00:13:55.780 --> 00:13:58.180]   Yes, apostleship is not something that's like,
[00:13:58.180 --> 00:14:00.580]   that's nice, I'd like to be one.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:03.620]   Apostles are hand-picked by Christ, right?
[00:14:03.620 --> 00:14:06.680]   And so, in terms of the position of apostle,
[00:14:06.680 --> 00:14:09.380]   it was very limited and just as he said,
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:12.760]   because it came with that kind of appointment,
[00:14:12.760 --> 00:14:14.900]   it also came with that kind of authority.
[00:14:14.900 --> 00:14:18.540]   So when Apostle Peter says, I'm the apostle of Jesus Christ,
[00:14:18.540 --> 00:14:22.100]   later on, he's gonna talk about how Christ is our Lord
[00:14:22.100 --> 00:14:25.000]   and it comes with that kind of authority.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:27.860]   And so, whenever you see that term being used
[00:14:27.860 --> 00:14:30.020]   within the church context or even in the letters,
[00:14:30.020 --> 00:14:31.420]   you will see that there's a defense
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.340]   of the kind of authority behind it
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:37.580]   because the position itself was truly like an ambassador.
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:40.020]   Somebody who is carrying the message
[00:14:40.020 --> 00:14:42.300]   that the Lord desires to send, okay?
[00:14:42.300 --> 00:14:45.500]   We're not gonna spend too much extensive time on that,
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:46.860]   but I just wanna encourage again,
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:50.760]   that we ask great questions as we study the passage.
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:53.900]   The next part of it, part B of verse one says,
[00:14:53.900 --> 00:14:56.540]   to those who reside as aliens,
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.600]   scattered throughout Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia,
[00:14:59.600 --> 00:15:03.380]   Asia, Bithynia, who are chosen.
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:07.100]   And at this point, I wanna share with you
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:09.240]   that whenever I do my Bible study,
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:13.220]   I typically take it phrase at a time, okay?
[00:15:13.220 --> 00:15:14.540]   Phrase at a time.
[00:15:14.540 --> 00:15:17.220]   And I try to look at how each phrase
[00:15:17.220 --> 00:15:19.000]   continues to relate to one another.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:22.400]   So, the way that I would do this is this.
[00:15:22.400 --> 00:15:25.800]   I start with just a phrase, to those who,
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:28.320]   and then I immediately, let me see if I can do this today.
[00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.360]   This is why I did it.
[00:15:29.360 --> 00:15:33.840]   Who, these are the recipients, okay?
[00:15:33.840 --> 00:15:34.680]   Can you see that?
[00:15:34.680 --> 00:15:35.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:37.120]   You know what, I'm probably not gonna do this.
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:40.600]   All right, to those who, these are the recipients.
[00:15:40.600 --> 00:15:43.360]   And there's an emphasis on the individuals
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:45.520]   that are his recipients that he's talking about.
[00:15:45.520 --> 00:15:48.260]   And the next phrases all describe them.
[00:15:50.280 --> 00:15:52.800]   What comes reside as aliens.
[00:15:52.800 --> 00:15:54.640]   So, I'm just gonna draw a line.
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:55.480]   Oh, no.
[00:15:55.480 --> 00:15:57.400]   Okay.
[00:15:57.400 --> 00:15:59.600]   Right here.
[00:15:59.600 --> 00:16:03.560]   And these next several ones are all gonna be, okay,
[00:16:03.560 --> 00:16:06.000]   connected to this concept.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.320]   Here we go.
[00:16:07.320 --> 00:16:09.040]   Scattered throughout Pontius,
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:13.520]   Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia, okay?
[00:16:13.520 --> 00:16:16.080]   So, it's hard for you to see the red line.
[00:16:16.080 --> 00:16:18.140]   Next time, I'm gonna try something different.
[00:16:18.140 --> 00:16:22.400]   But when I diagram my verse, this is how I do it.
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:25.640]   And I say, to those who reside as aliens,
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.480]   to those who are scattered,
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:32.040]   and then the last one is to those who are chosen, right?
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.120]   So, when I'm starting to look at, I guess,
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:38.520]   sometimes even when I'm trying to prepare a Bible study,
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:40.960]   if I see that there is a connection like this,
[00:16:40.960 --> 00:16:44.560]   I realize now there's going to be an added to one bucket,
[00:16:44.560 --> 00:16:47.560]   one concept, a kind of full theme.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:49.020]   These are individuals who are residing
[00:16:49.020 --> 00:16:51.460]   as aliens, scattered, and chosen, okay?
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:54.300]   Now, I have a bunch of questions to ask.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:56.140]   What does he mean by aliens?
[00:16:56.140 --> 00:16:58.420]   Right?
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:02.020]   So, also, right now, you guys don't have to copy
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.540]   or rewrite the entire thing, sorry.
[00:17:04.540 --> 00:17:05.940]   The reason why I put the verse there
[00:17:05.940 --> 00:17:08.180]   is because what you can do
[00:17:08.180 --> 00:17:10.180]   is as you're going through your Bibles,
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:13.700]   you guys can just, again, highlight one thing,
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:17.300]   and then just draw a little line, you know?
[00:17:17.300 --> 00:17:20.300]   Like that, between each phrase is to chop it up.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:23.620]   And then you guys can draw a line towards what it modifies.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:26.500]   So, when I look at the relationship of phrases,
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:30.060]   I start asking the question, what does this phrase modify?
[00:17:30.060 --> 00:17:32.420]   These phrases modify the concept of who it is.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:34.360]   That was what I kind of repetitively said.
[00:17:34.360 --> 00:17:36.480]   But, as I ask that question, you know what I'm doing
[00:17:36.480 --> 00:17:40.660]   is I'm practicing the hermeneutical principle of syntax.
[00:17:40.660 --> 00:17:42.260]   I am observing the relationship
[00:17:42.260 --> 00:17:44.660]   between phrase to phrase, word to word,
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:49.660]   and that actually teaches me a whole lot, okay?
[00:17:49.660 --> 00:17:51.980]   Going forward, I ask this question.
[00:17:51.980 --> 00:17:54.740]   Aliens, what does he mean by aliens?
[00:17:54.740 --> 00:17:56.780]   Is he just metaphorically saying,
[00:17:56.780 --> 00:17:59.980]   oh, you guys are pilgrims in this day and age.
[00:17:59.980 --> 00:18:02.460]   You have a heavenly place, so you're just pilgrims.
[00:18:02.460 --> 00:18:03.980]   Is this metaphorical?
[00:18:03.980 --> 00:18:05.860]   Is it just simply spiritual?
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.380]   Is he talking more like social?
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.380]   Because socially, you guys are aliens to those individuals?
[00:18:13.500 --> 00:18:15.300]   Here's another question.
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:17.300]   When he says they're scattered,
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.260]   you can ask, what does that mean?
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.260]   But also, you wanna ask, why are they scattered, right?
[00:18:23.260 --> 00:18:25.460]   Here's another question.
[00:18:25.460 --> 00:18:30.460]   He actually gives a list of Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia,
[00:18:30.460 --> 00:18:34.940]   Bithynia, and he gives a name of cities, right?
[00:18:34.940 --> 00:18:36.900]   So, as you make this observation, you realize,
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:40.520]   hey, is there any significance to that location?
[00:18:40.520 --> 00:18:43.420]   So, now we have a lot to say, okay?
[00:18:43.420 --> 00:18:45.740]   But, hold on here.
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:47.900]   Oops.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.260]   But, this is what we'll do.
[00:18:49.260 --> 00:18:51.500]   Rather than answering all the questions,
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:52.860]   this is what I'm gonna say.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:18:56.100]   In answering the first one, is it metaphorical,
[00:18:56.100 --> 00:19:00.060]   is it spiritual, in order for something to be metaphorical,
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:01.620]   there has to be good reason.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:03.540]   Let me say that again.
[00:19:03.540 --> 00:19:04.660]   When you do your Bible interpretation,
[00:19:04.660 --> 00:19:06.620]   in order for something to be metaphorical,
[00:19:06.620 --> 00:19:08.580]   there has to be something in the text
[00:19:08.580 --> 00:19:11.900]   where the plain reading, the literal reading of the word,
[00:19:11.900 --> 00:19:13.900]   okay, the literal reading of the word,
[00:19:13.900 --> 00:19:17.140]   is kinda, doesn't make sense, or it's not sufficient,
[00:19:17.140 --> 00:19:19.100]   but rather, something in the text tells me
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:20.940]   that this is metaphorical.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:24.020]   But, here, in this passage, because of the list of cities,
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:26.100]   and because, if you study the background,
[00:19:26.100 --> 00:19:28.940]   we know that there was intense persecution,
[00:19:28.940 --> 00:19:30.920]   especially in this region.
[00:19:30.920 --> 00:19:35.300]   We realize, actually, Apostle Peter is literally saying,
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.780]   all of you who are scattered across.
[00:19:37.780 --> 00:19:39.380]   So, he's not speaking to a specific church,
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.340]   but he's speaking to the Christians
[00:19:41.340 --> 00:19:43.940]   who are dispersed, and as a matter of fact,
[00:19:43.940 --> 00:19:46.780]   the term scattered is diaspora,
[00:19:46.780 --> 00:19:49.700]   which, historically, referred to how the Jews
[00:19:49.700 --> 00:19:52.020]   have been scattered, whether by, you know,
[00:19:52.020 --> 00:19:54.000]   that, you know, like, captivity,
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:56.220]   and all that kinda stuff, okay?
[00:19:56.220 --> 00:19:58.460]   Let me share with you a little bit about the background,
[00:19:58.460 --> 00:20:00.080]   as an introduction to the book,
[00:20:00.080 --> 00:20:02.220]   but also, as an important place right now
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:05.100]   to talk about who he's speaking to.
[00:20:05.100 --> 00:20:08.760]   The Christians at that time, around the time
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.980]   when Apostle Peter was writing this,
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:13.380]   again, they were not under just hardship.
[00:20:13.380 --> 00:20:15.660]   They were intensely persecuted.
[00:20:15.660 --> 00:20:18.580]   You guys have probably heard the name Emperor Nero.
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:21.460]   This individual, in history, according to,
[00:20:21.460 --> 00:20:24.260]   not just Christians, but every historian,
[00:20:24.260 --> 00:20:26.220]   was a lunatic, a madman.
[00:20:26.220 --> 00:20:28.900]   As a matter of fact, when I was a philosophy major at UCI,
[00:20:28.900 --> 00:20:31.100]   I read a book called The Twelve Caesars,
[00:20:31.100 --> 00:20:32.760]   from one of my philosophy classes
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:34.180]   in classical studies and stuff,
[00:20:34.180 --> 00:20:36.060]   and it talks about the Caesars of the day,
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:39.320]   and Nero was seen as one of the most vicious emperors
[00:20:39.320 --> 00:20:41.260]   that I've ever lived.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:45.980]   This man was insane, and he had an insanity
[00:20:45.980 --> 00:20:48.220]   where he had an obsession with building,
[00:20:48.220 --> 00:20:49.900]   so much so that what he would do is
[00:20:49.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   he would set fire to certain areas,
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:54.480]   burn it down purely for the sake
[00:20:54.480 --> 00:20:57.540]   of building things to his name and glory.
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:20:59.140]   So you'd imagine, like, you know,
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:01.380]   he would sometimes burn places down.
[00:21:01.380 --> 00:21:04.100]   Because of his insanity, he would even clear the area,
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.860]   and now, there was kind of an uproar.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:08.860]   There was suspicion of, what in the world is this man doing?
[00:21:09.840 --> 00:21:12.280]   In order to divert that attention,
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:16.800]   Emperor Nero decided to scapegoat on the Christians.
[00:21:16.800 --> 00:21:20.000]   Christians were already seen as, like, a weird sect,
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:21.960]   almost as cultish and whatnot,
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.600]   because they wouldn't worship the emperor.
[00:21:23.600 --> 00:21:26.520]   They wouldn't worship the gods of the Romans.
[00:21:26.520 --> 00:21:27.840]   And so what eventually happened was
[00:21:27.840 --> 00:21:30.160]   Emperor Nero blamed the Christians,
[00:21:30.160 --> 00:21:31.840]   and in order to show the people, like,
[00:21:31.840 --> 00:21:33.800]   look how righteous I am,
[00:21:33.800 --> 00:21:38.000]   Emperor Nero would murder Christians regularly.
[00:21:38.000 --> 00:21:39.640]   There are stories of how Emperor Nero
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:42.300]   would wax Christians and burn them.
[00:21:42.300 --> 00:21:43.700]   There are stories of how Emperor Nero
[00:21:43.700 --> 00:21:46.760]   would send the Christians into the gauntlet,
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:48.780]   how Emperor Nero would send them amongst the beast
[00:21:48.780 --> 00:21:50.720]   for sport that he would cause, you know,
[00:21:50.720 --> 00:21:53.200]   them to be chased and all this kind of stuff.
[00:21:53.200 --> 00:21:54.820]   And the things that are listed
[00:21:54.820 --> 00:21:57.020]   about what he would do to Christians
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:22:00.100]   is almost too vocal to even mention in this place.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.720]   It's wild.
[00:22:01.720 --> 00:22:03.680]   So the people that he's talking to,
[00:22:03.680 --> 00:22:08.560]   literally, they were aliens, as in refugees.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.040]   Right?
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:14.360]   Refugees who are running for their lives.
[00:22:14.360 --> 00:22:17.320]   Refugees, just as you would imagine today,
[00:22:17.320 --> 00:22:18.960]   who are losing their parents,
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.280]   losing their brothers and all their family,
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.640]   and on the run.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:26.040]   That's the kind of concept we're thinking about,
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:27.760]   and it was literal.
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.360]   It wasn't just metaphorical.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:33.760]   And so, in this kind of time,
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:36.720]   Apostle Peter is addressing them,
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:38.980]   and he recognizes you are aliens.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:40.200]   You are scattered.
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:41.220]   But what ends up happening is,
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:42.980]   as he goes down this list,
[00:22:42.980 --> 00:22:46.440]   there is this emphasis on this last one,
[00:22:46.440 --> 00:22:48.360]   who are chosen.
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:50.640]   Because yes, he's talking about how they were,
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:51.680]   you know, getting chased,
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.440]   and how they were scattered across,
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:54.520]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.640]   But all of a sudden, there's almost like a contrast
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:22:59.120]   that says, but, you're chosen.
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.680]   And this concept of being chosen is a doctrine for us
[00:23:02.680 --> 00:23:04.360]   that's rich and deep, is it not?
[00:23:04.360 --> 00:23:06.920]   The doctrine of election.
[00:23:06.920 --> 00:23:09.240]   And Apostle Peter, when we ask the question,
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:12.600]   how does he address and encourage these Christians,
[00:23:12.600 --> 00:23:16.240]   he's going to teach them and remind them
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:18.480]   of the doctrine of election.
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:20.240]   So, let's take a look at verse two.
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:23.400]   Verse two says,
[00:23:23.400 --> 00:23:27.420]   according to the foreknowledge of God, the Father,
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:30.000]   by the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:34.280]   to obey Jesus Christ and be sprinkled with his blood.
[00:23:34.280 --> 00:23:38.400]   May grace and peace be yours in the fullest measure.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.960]   Okay?
[00:23:39.960 --> 00:23:44.040]   So, we first have, the way that I would diagram it is,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.600]   if you're writing on your paper,
[00:23:45.600 --> 00:23:48.260]   again, for you guys right now on the paragraph,
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:50.600]   you guys can just start drawing segments,
[00:23:50.600 --> 00:23:52.800]   draw a line to break up the phrases,
[00:23:52.800 --> 00:23:54.700]   and then draw connecting lines, okay?
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:59.200]   He goes from who, and then, da, da, da, da, da,
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:01.080]   are chosen, and then from chosen,
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:03.400]   his thought continues to progress.
[00:24:03.400 --> 00:24:04.920]   And then he says this,
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:08.800]   chosen according to the foreknowledge of God, the Father,
[00:24:08.800 --> 00:24:10.440]   right?
[00:24:10.440 --> 00:24:13.680]   Chosen by the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:17.240]   and lastly, chosen to obey Christ
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.400]   and be sprinkled with his blood.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.580]   So, oops, oh no, okay?
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:30.220]   So again, if I was diagramming this,
[00:24:30.220 --> 00:24:32.220]   I would start drawing a line here,
[00:24:32.220 --> 00:24:34.280]   coming down to this way.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.860]   But as we make our observations,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:40.180]   we really start to have lots that we can ask.
[00:24:40.180 --> 00:24:42.140]   So, I want you guys to just take
[00:24:42.140 --> 00:24:45.140]   about two to three minutes, okay?
[00:24:45.140 --> 00:24:48.140]   And this is just gonna be, again, an exercise for us.
[00:24:48.140 --> 00:24:51.060]   We look at this verse that emphasizes
[00:24:51.060 --> 00:24:54.100]   this concept and doctrine of being chosen.
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:57.700]   What kind of questions can you ask about these phrases?
[00:24:57.700 --> 00:24:58.520]   Okay?
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:00.300]   You guys can do it as a team,
[00:25:00.300 --> 00:25:01.820]   and then take about three minutes.
[00:25:01.820 --> 00:25:02.720]   Ready, go.
[00:25:02.720 --> 00:25:05.640]   (audience chatter)

[00:28:03.680 --> 00:28:10.240]   Okay, so for those of you guys who don't have packets,
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.080]   apologize, I'll print some more next time.
[00:28:13.080 --> 00:28:14.200]   I just sent some to the printer
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:16.920]   and we'll have some of those coming real soon, okay?
[00:28:16.920 --> 00:28:20.080]   Let's gather our thoughts here, okay?
[00:28:20.080 --> 00:28:23.840]   So I asked you to think about some questions
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:26.440]   pertaining to this verse,
[00:28:26.440 --> 00:28:29.160]   focusing on the concept of chosen, okay?
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:31.600]   What are some questions that you guys came up with?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:39.200]   Cool, yes, thank you, Matthew.
[00:28:39.200 --> 00:28:41.040]   - My team asked the question,
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.360]   is there any relationship between Peter being chosen
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.920]   as an apostle and his audience being chosen?
[00:28:47.920 --> 00:28:50.160]   - Okay, great question.
[00:28:50.160 --> 00:28:52.480]   Who does this chosen apply to?
[00:28:52.480 --> 00:28:55.680]   Is there a relationship between Peter being chosen
[00:28:55.680 --> 00:28:57.960]   and the people being chosen as well, good.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.760]   Others, other questions?
[00:29:00.760 --> 00:29:11.520]   How about, let's see, this group in the front.
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:20.480]   - Are we chosen to obey or do we choose to obey?
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:25.480]   - Ooh, okay, are we chosen to obey or do we choose to obey?
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.520]   Good, that's a question about how this,
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:33.520]   the idea of God's sovereignty over us is working, okay?
[00:29:33.520 --> 00:29:37.240]   So there are some really good questions
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:38.480]   that you guys can ask.
[00:29:38.480 --> 00:29:41.160]   Some of the questions that I asked was,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:44.280]   what is the nature of God's foreknowledge, okay?
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:47.400]   What is the nature of God's foreknowledge?
[00:29:47.400 --> 00:29:49.400]   Another question I asked was,
[00:29:49.400 --> 00:29:52.680]   how does the sanctifying work of the Spirit
[00:29:52.680 --> 00:29:55.880]   work together with God's foreknowledge, okay?
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:00.920]   So there's a lot of questions that you guys can ask.
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:03.880]   Now, on the side, you guys can't see it.
[00:30:03.880 --> 00:30:04.880]   Again, I'm just gonna,
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:06.880]   I was initially trying to do something on my iPad,
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:08.120]   it's not working.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:09.920]   But anyway, on the first one,
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:12.920]   on the first one, top number two, or verse two,
[00:30:12.920 --> 00:30:16.080]   I wrote an S because as I look at this passage,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:18.360]   I'm trying to observe and ask the question.
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:22.120]   He's saying you are chosen, and he says according to.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:25.120]   These prepositional words, I always try to ask,
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:26.680]   what is that trying to teach me?
[00:30:26.680 --> 00:30:28.160]   Because it teaches you a lot.
[00:30:28.160 --> 00:30:31.120]   If something is according to his foreknowledge,
[00:30:31.120 --> 00:30:34.440]   then that means it has, it resembles that thing.
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.920]   Or another way you can put it is,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.720]   it has its source in God's foreknowledge.
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:40.360]   So a lot of times what I'll do is,
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.200]   when I'm preparing a Bible study, I'll say,
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:44.320]   hey, today we're gonna talk about being chosen.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:47.080]   First, you're chosen, and the source of being chosen
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:49.760]   is God's foreknowledge, you know, of you.
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:30:51.080]   So I'll put source.
[00:30:51.080 --> 00:30:53.520]   By, the preposition by tells us
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.560]   in terms of the means, or how, right?
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:30:58.520]   So by the sanctifying work of the Spirit,
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:31:00.960]   and so I'll talk, I'll teach on the idea of,
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:03.400]   you know, like the means and how God
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:07.000]   continues to work out salvation and his election of us.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:10.400]   To, the simple word to tells us
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.200]   the result or the purpose, right?
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:14.960]   So now I have a three-point sermon.
[00:31:16.040 --> 00:31:20.040]   Our election, the source, the means, the purpose.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.040]   Bam, sermon done, right?
[00:31:22.040 --> 00:31:23.200]   That's how I do it.
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:25.240]   So you can see how asking the question
[00:31:25.240 --> 00:31:29.360]   of how the phrases attach to those simple concepts
[00:31:29.360 --> 00:31:33.480]   is the exercise of syntax, and it teaches us a lot, okay?
[00:31:33.480 --> 00:31:38.480]   Now I wanna take a moment here to think about this.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:40.720]   Let's, actually, you know, I have some
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:41.880]   of these questions here.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:43.160]   Or let me just think about this for a minute.
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:45.520]   What do we learn about God, you know?
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:49.480]   When we say that, oh, God is choosing us,
[00:31:49.480 --> 00:31:51.600]   and then you can read your Bible and cursory,
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:52.680]   again, just go over and say,
[00:31:52.680 --> 00:31:54.240]   oh yeah, Doctrine and Covenants, great.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.080]   That's like every other letter that, you know,
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.440]   Apostle Paul or whoever it may be is,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:00.640]   always starts with, you know,
[00:32:00.640 --> 00:32:02.840]   thank God for our salvation.
[00:32:02.840 --> 00:32:04.720]   But on another side, you can ask this deeply
[00:32:04.720 --> 00:32:07.800]   into this question of what does that teach us about God?
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:11.280]   Well, let's answer some of these questions, you know?
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.920]   Like, you know, are there other passages
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:16.920]   that describe God having a foreknowledge,
[00:32:16.920 --> 00:32:18.760]   a knowledge of people?
[00:32:18.760 --> 00:32:21.760]   And in asking that question, we ask,
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:24.240]   what is the nature of God's foreknowledge?
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.360]   And I wanna ask you that question.
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:28.000]   Like, what is the nature of God's knowledge of us?
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:30.280]   There have been camps of people who will say,
[00:32:30.280 --> 00:32:33.120]   God's knowledge of us is kinda like prediction.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.960]   There are those individuals who believe God's foreknowledge
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.400]   is like God looking down into time,
[00:32:39.400 --> 00:32:40.960]   knowing what you're going to do,
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:43.320]   and therefore, he behaves in a certain fashion.
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:45.320]   So he looks down the corridor of time,
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:48.080]   knows you're gonna choose and receive his gospel,
[00:32:48.080 --> 00:32:50.120]   and therefore, he accepts you into his kingdom,
[00:32:50.120 --> 00:32:51.360]   or whatever it may be.
[00:32:51.360 --> 00:32:53.440]   That's a whole camp of theology.
[00:32:53.440 --> 00:32:56.280]   Is that the nature of God's foreknowledge
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:32:58.600]   that we can learn even from this passage?
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:01.240]   There's a, you know, when I ask the question,
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:03.440]   like how does God's sanctifying work
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:04.960]   work together with his foreknowledge,
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:07.200]   these are all questions that we can actually observe
[00:33:07.200 --> 00:33:08.880]   from this passage alone.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:10.200]   But I wanna start with this question
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.080]   that I asked just a moment ago.
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:15.760]   And again, I'm asking for audience participation here.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:18.640]   Are there evidences, or at least examples
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:20.800]   from the Old Testament or New Testament
[00:33:20.800 --> 00:33:23.560]   where scripture talks about God having a foreknowledge,
[00:33:23.560 --> 00:33:26.800]   a knowledge of somebody before they even were?
[00:33:26.800 --> 00:33:31.560]   Yes?
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:35.760]   Oh, come on.
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:37.440]   (laughs)
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:39.120]   Yes, right?
[00:33:39.120 --> 00:33:41.000]   Can you guys tell me, like, can we just, you know,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:42.960]   again, as an exercise of jogging our memories,
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:43.840]   what are some passages?
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:44.680]   Yes, Grace?
[00:33:44.680 --> 00:33:48.360]   Excellent.
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:50.600]   Psalm 139, when King David says,
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:53.000]   in that passage, he says, like,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:54.800]   you search me and you know me.
[00:33:54.800 --> 00:33:57.600]   In my mother's womb, right?
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:33:59.640]   So scripture actually talks much,
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:03.920]   not just King David, but a lot of the prophets,
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:06.600]   like Jeremiah, Isaiah, when it talks about
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:09.600]   certain individuals, they kinda wonder,
[00:34:09.600 --> 00:34:11.760]   and not wonder as in pensive,
[00:34:11.760 --> 00:34:13.720]   but they are amazed at the fact
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:15.800]   that God knows them so intimately,
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.280]   to the degree, not that he just knows them,
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:20.960]   but that he is intimately forming them.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:25.160]   So, from other passages of the scripture,
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:27.520]   is God's foreknowledge a foreknowledge
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:29.320]   in which he just sees what you're gonna do?
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:30.880]   No.
[00:34:30.880 --> 00:34:33.400]   As a matter of fact, his foreknowledge, then,
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:36.480]   is a lot more purposeful, it's more intentional,
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:39.080]   and it's formative, right?
[00:34:39.080 --> 00:34:41.200]   And that's what scripture continues to teach us.
[00:34:41.200 --> 00:34:43.760]   As a matter of fact, when we look at this passage alone,
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.080]   when we ask the question, in his foreknowledge,
[00:34:46.080 --> 00:34:47.720]   what is actually happening,
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.960]   let's just kinda take a cursory look at the whole passage.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:52.680]   In verse two, he talked about how, again,
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:55.080]   according to this foreknowledge, he chose us,
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.200]   he said, by the sanctifying work,
[00:34:57.200 --> 00:34:58.600]   and then in verse three, he says,
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:01.160]   blessed be God of our father, Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:35:01.160 --> 00:35:02.520]   who, according to his mercies,
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:04.640]   caused us to be born again,
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:05.880]   and then, verse four, he says,
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:07.640]   to obtain a hope inheritance,
[00:35:08.520 --> 00:35:09.480]   actually, let's go to verse five,
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:12.200]   and who protected you by the power of God through faith
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:15.040]   for salvation, ready to be reeled in the last time.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:17.520]   Does that seem like a God
[00:35:17.520 --> 00:35:21.360]   who, uninvolved, is just looking into the future?
[00:35:21.360 --> 00:35:22.280]   Absolutely not.
[00:35:22.280 --> 00:35:24.440]   Actually, that sounds like a God
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:25.880]   who, according to his foreknowledge,
[00:35:25.880 --> 00:35:30.880]   planned, then worked, then executed, and then accomplished.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.160]   Right?
[00:35:32.160 --> 00:35:33.760]   That is God's foreknowledge of us.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:37.120]   It is not one that is absent, not absentee,
[00:35:37.120 --> 00:35:39.200]   but rather, he is calling us out,
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.360]   separating us for a unique purpose,
[00:35:41.360 --> 00:35:44.800]   and he is going to accomplish it with this power.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:47.320]   He directs our minds, he directs our will,
[00:35:47.320 --> 00:35:48.720]   he directs everything.
[00:35:48.720 --> 00:35:52.520]   That is the way in which Apostle Peter
[00:35:52.520 --> 00:35:55.600]   is encouraging those who feel, perhaps,
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.800]   that God is far, who feel, perhaps,
[00:35:57.800 --> 00:36:00.780]   that that most powerful person is emperor and hero.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.680]   That's what's happening.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.320]   And so, I wanna encourage us,
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:08.260]   there's this passage in Isaiah, chapter 46,
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:10.680]   verse eight through 11, that reads like this.
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:12.560]   Remember this and be assured,
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:14.640]   recall it to your mind.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:16.520]   Remember the former things long past,
[00:36:16.520 --> 00:36:18.200]   for I am God and there is no other.
[00:36:18.200 --> 00:36:20.880]   I am God and there is no one like me.
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:23.280]   Declaring the end from the beginning,
[00:36:23.280 --> 00:36:27.560]   from ancient times, the things which have not been done,
[00:36:27.560 --> 00:36:29.800]   saying my purpose will be established
[00:36:29.800 --> 00:36:32.880]   and I will accomplish all my good pleasure.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:34.600]   Calling a bird of prey from the east,
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:36.440]   a man of my purpose from a far country.
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:40.040]   Truly, I have spoken, truly, I will bring to pass.
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.100]   I have planned it, surely, I will do it.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:46.080]   Just from asking a simple question
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:47.920]   of what is the nature of God's foreknowledge,
[00:36:47.920 --> 00:36:51.880]   we can be reminded, God is a God of absolute sovereignty
[00:36:51.880 --> 00:36:55.720]   and what he knows is not simply in his intellect,
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.960]   what he knows, he decrees and accomplishes, amen?
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:02.720]   What a great encouragement for us.
[00:37:02.720 --> 00:37:04.060]   Whenever we feel so stressed
[00:37:04.060 --> 00:37:06.920]   and we feel like things are spiraling out of control,
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:08.080]   what a great encouragement for us
[00:37:08.080 --> 00:37:11.720]   when we feel and when we see is other people in power,
[00:37:11.720 --> 00:37:14.320]   other forces in play that we cannot,
[00:37:14.320 --> 00:37:16.440]   that's out of our control.
[00:37:16.440 --> 00:37:18.480]   And sometimes because things are out of our control,
[00:37:18.480 --> 00:37:20.360]   we assume hopeless.
[00:37:20.360 --> 00:37:23.760]   But then Apostle Peter is reminding them,
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:26.220]   God has chosen you, right?
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.280]   With his foreknowledge, with the work of his spirit.
[00:37:29.280 --> 00:37:32.400]   Now, moving forward just a little bit,
[00:37:33.640 --> 00:37:37.520]   he asks this question, or he says that this, again,
[00:37:37.520 --> 00:37:40.600]   this being chosen has a source,
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:42.720]   has a means, and has a purpose.
[00:37:42.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   We're not gonna spend an incredible amount of time
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:46.560]   on this for the sake of time,
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:49.040]   but that's something that we could look into too.
[00:37:49.040 --> 00:37:50.880]   You know, when it says to obey,
[00:37:50.880 --> 00:37:53.460]   to be sprinkled with his blood.
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:55.440]   Now, that's pretty unique, right?
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:56.760]   Because we've read Ephesians
[00:37:56.760 --> 00:37:57.980]   and we've memorized those passages,
[00:37:57.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   we know like we were saved by grace,
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:05.100]   as a workmanship, like destined for good works, right?
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.580]   Served for good works.
[00:38:06.580 --> 00:38:08.320]   But then we have here to obey,
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:11.800]   and then he has this idea of being sprinkled with his blood.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:15.180]   I wanna encourage you, if you have the ESV Bible,
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:18.200]   the NASB Bible with the cross references, look at those.
[00:38:18.200 --> 00:38:19.980]   You know, look at those passages.
[00:38:19.980 --> 00:38:21.940]   And this is another exercise you do
[00:38:21.940 --> 00:38:23.340]   when you ask the question of,
[00:38:23.340 --> 00:38:25.940]   I wonder why he gave this unique phrase,
[00:38:25.940 --> 00:38:27.380]   be sprinkled with his blood.
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:29.640]   What's the significance there?
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:32.080]   Does that just mean salvation?
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:33.740]   You should ask, right?
[00:38:33.740 --> 00:38:35.960]   And if you look up those cross references,
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.700]   if you look up either the ESV reference Bible,
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:42.300]   or you look up the NASB, you'll find two verses.
[00:38:42.300 --> 00:38:45.260]   Hebrews 10.22 and Hebrews 12.24.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:47.420]   I have those in your packet, right?
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:49.220]   In your own time, you can take a look at those
[00:38:49.220 --> 00:38:50.460]   and ask the question,
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:53.540]   when the Bible talks about being sprinkled with his blood,
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.900]   what does it typically refer to?
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:58.580]   Or what does it seem like in this context,
[00:38:58.580 --> 00:38:59.940]   because remember, you always have to look
[00:38:59.940 --> 00:39:02.020]   at the immediate context here first.
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.620]   What do you think he's looking at, right?
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:07.020]   Moving forward, verse three.
[00:39:07.020 --> 00:39:09.440]   Verse three.
[00:39:09.440 --> 00:39:10.460]   And verse three through six,
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.340]   we're gonna go through a little bit faster.
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.180]   So let's read it together, or I'll read it for us.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:18.180]   Verse three through, let's say five first,
[00:39:18.180 --> 00:39:19.660]   and bunch that together.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:21.700]   He says, "Blessed be God,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:24.780]   "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, okay?
[00:39:24.780 --> 00:39:26.780]   "Who according to his great mercy
[00:39:26.820 --> 00:39:29.140]   "has caused us to be born again to a living hope
[00:39:29.140 --> 00:39:31.780]   "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.280]   "To obtain an inheritance which is imperishable
[00:39:34.280 --> 00:39:36.240]   "and undefiled and will not fade away,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:38.020]   "reserved in heaven for you,
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:40.900]   "who are protected by the power of God through faith
[00:39:40.900 --> 00:39:44.660]   "for a salvation ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:39:44.660 --> 00:39:45.500]   Okay?
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:48.420]   Now what's hard about this is verse three through five
[00:39:48.420 --> 00:39:51.420]   is one incredible run-on sentence, okay?
[00:39:51.420 --> 00:39:55.420]   And actually, even longer, it's just like run-on going down.
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:58.620]   So there's a sentiment already in which
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:02.820]   there is kind of like an overflowing passion and thought
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.140]   to what he's about to say,
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:06.540]   and what he's about to say is to focus on
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.700]   the great salvation that we have, right?
[00:40:09.700 --> 00:40:11.700]   But let's break it down a little bit.
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.820]   First, "Blessed be God,
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:16.340]   "the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,"
[00:40:16.340 --> 00:40:18.540]   and then let's break these things down.
[00:40:18.540 --> 00:40:20.920]   "Who has caused us to be born again,"
[00:40:20.920 --> 00:40:22.740]   and then I put a little lips because
[00:40:22.740 --> 00:40:25.380]   in terms of according to his great mercy,
[00:40:25.380 --> 00:40:28.860]   that's another phrase describing this idea
[00:40:28.860 --> 00:40:32.300]   of being born, or caused to be born again.
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:36.220]   Next, "He has caused us to be born again to a living hope."
[00:40:36.220 --> 00:40:38.380]   Lastly, "He has caused us to be born again
[00:40:38.380 --> 00:40:42.820]   "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:45.940]   And just like before, when we asked the question,
[00:40:45.940 --> 00:40:47.180]   from all these phrases,
[00:40:47.180 --> 00:40:49.620]   how do they relate to the concept beforehand?
[00:40:49.620 --> 00:40:51.620]   Well, first and foremost, it starts off,
[00:40:51.620 --> 00:40:53.100]   "God should be blessed."
[00:40:53.100 --> 00:40:54.020]   Why?
[00:40:54.020 --> 00:40:56.940]   Because God has caused us to be born again,
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:59.580]   according to his mercy, to a living hope,
[00:40:59.580 --> 00:41:02.980]   through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.060]   And just like before, we have a similar structure,
[00:41:06.060 --> 00:41:08.820]   and that structure is, when he focuses on the concept
[00:41:08.820 --> 00:41:13.820]   of being born again, there is a source, his mercies.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:17.460]   There is a means, right, through the resurrection,
[00:41:17.460 --> 00:41:19.660]   and there is a purpose to hope.
[00:41:19.660 --> 00:41:23.120]   That's the kind of relationships you can observe
[00:41:23.120 --> 00:41:25.420]   as you look at this passage.
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:27.460]   Let's move forward, okay, let's move forward
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:30.220]   into the next verse, verse four.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.460]   "To obtain an inheritance which is imperishable
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.740]   "and undefiled and will not fade away,
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:40.260]   "reserved in heaven for you."
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:43.080]   So, the way that I would put this is,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:45.860]   in verse four, it connects to this idea
[00:41:45.860 --> 00:41:48.460]   of being caused to be born again.
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:49.940]   We asked a question, when it says,
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.200]   "To obtain an inheritance," what does that modify?
[00:41:53.200 --> 00:41:54.400]   What's that connected to?
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.000]   And it's the idea that God has caused you
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:59.520]   to be born again for this, to have an inheritance
[00:41:59.520 --> 00:42:02.580]   which is imperishable, undefiled, will not fade away,
[00:42:02.580 --> 00:42:04.960]   reserved in heaven for you.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:08.720]   So, now we take a moment to pause.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:13.080]   Oh, man, maybe when I, again, in cursory reading,
[00:42:13.080 --> 00:42:16.360]   it was just like, oh, man, they're lofty words.
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:17.920]   I remember thinking sometimes, you know,
[00:42:17.920 --> 00:42:19.620]   when I was an early Christian,
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:21.940]   and a pastor would come up to pray,
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:24.540]   and then they would use words like majestic,
[00:42:24.540 --> 00:42:28.320]   you know, unending, you know, transcendent,
[00:42:28.320 --> 00:42:31.820]   this and that, I would always have a sentiment of like,
[00:42:31.820 --> 00:42:36.820]   oh, man, over-exaggeration, irreal, you know, so cliche.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:40.940]   But the fact of the matter is, if you start to slow down
[00:42:40.940 --> 00:42:44.340]   to look at the details, he's just adding upon
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:48.600]   one and the other the magnitude of what God has done for us
[00:42:48.600 --> 00:42:51.080]   in causing us to be born again,
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:54.200]   that there's so much involved,
[00:42:54.200 --> 00:42:56.600]   that there's so much of this, I guess you could say,
[00:42:56.600 --> 00:43:00.400]   advantage, and when I look at this passage,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:03.200]   and he talks about us receiving this inheritance
[00:43:03.200 --> 00:43:05.240]   by God causing us to be born again,
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:07.920]   it totally convicts me.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:10.500]   Look at what he talks about, how he addresses
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:13.520]   this concept of having our inheritance,
[00:43:13.520 --> 00:43:15.640]   the inheritance imperishable, undefiled,
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.320]   will not fade away, reserved in heaven for you.
[00:43:18.320 --> 00:43:23.120]   It convicts me because, to tell you truthfully,
[00:43:23.120 --> 00:43:26.480]   I get excited about the next device,
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:29.280]   the next iPhone, the next this,
[00:43:29.280 --> 00:43:32.320]   when they say like, oh, it's 15% lighter,
[00:43:32.320 --> 00:43:35.240]   wow, this laptop's so heavy,
[00:43:35.240 --> 00:43:37.320]   the battery last 20% longer,
[00:43:37.320 --> 00:43:40.880]   oh, 20% longer, you know?
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:42.960]   Now it's almost waterproof.
[00:43:43.720 --> 00:43:46.120]   Not quite, but almost, you know?
[00:43:46.120 --> 00:43:48.640]   The pixels won't fade.
[00:43:48.640 --> 00:43:51.360]   But when we think about this,
[00:43:51.360 --> 00:43:52.720]   Apostle Peter's trying to remind us,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:54.840]   we have something that's not simply going to improve,
[00:43:54.840 --> 00:43:58.160]   it is truly upgrade-proof.
[00:43:58.160 --> 00:44:01.320]   It is not going to fade.
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.640]   It is not going to be defiled.
[00:44:03.640 --> 00:44:06.440]   And we have this inheritance for us.
[00:44:06.440 --> 00:44:09.400]   So, by application for us, kind of putting it
[00:44:09.400 --> 00:44:11.760]   in our context, to tell you truthfully,
[00:44:11.760 --> 00:44:13.880]   there are a lot of people who complain
[00:44:13.880 --> 00:44:17.560]   about how things perish, how things continue to fade,
[00:44:17.560 --> 00:44:19.920]   like their memories, like their bodies
[00:44:19.920 --> 00:44:21.320]   are starting to degrade.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.600]   They start to complain about the possessions they have,
[00:44:23.600 --> 00:44:25.800]   their house problems, their relational problems,
[00:44:25.800 --> 00:44:26.960]   their work problems.
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.840]   We start to complain about all those things,
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:31.400]   but then we ask the question, and we wonder again,
[00:44:31.400 --> 00:44:33.120]   what did we expect?
[00:44:33.120 --> 00:44:37.480]   We're supposed to be challenged,
[00:44:37.480 --> 00:44:38.680]   and we're supposed to be encouraged.
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.960]   We have something that even if your kids
[00:44:41.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   are ruining your house and defiling everything,
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:48.640]   you have nothing to fear for your inheritance.
[00:44:48.640 --> 00:44:49.840]   Won't ever be defiled.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.160]   Won't ever fade.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:55.560]   Imperishable for us.
[00:44:55.560 --> 00:44:58.120]   And then he continues to keep adding it on.
[00:44:58.120 --> 00:45:00.360]   He continues to add on the magnitude
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.560]   of the salvation that we have by saying,
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.360]   you who are protected by the power of God,
[00:45:06.360 --> 00:45:08.600]   through faith for salvation,
[00:45:08.600 --> 00:45:11.560]   ready to be revealed in the last time.
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:15.960]   Now, I wish that I had this really, really long,
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   really, really big outline,
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:21.760]   because then we could see the buildup.
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:23.800]   The buildup, right?
[00:45:23.800 --> 00:45:26.760]   Let's put it together and summarize what we've been saying.
[00:45:26.760 --> 00:45:29.360]   If you put it together and run your eyes
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:32.120]   through chapter one, verses one down to verse five,
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:33.640]   there's so much.
[00:45:33.760 --> 00:45:37.240]   He says, you, you are chosen.
[00:45:37.240 --> 00:45:38.880]   You're born again.
[00:45:38.880 --> 00:45:40.960]   And you are protected.
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.400]   This is true of you, even if by sight
[00:45:43.400 --> 00:45:45.440]   and current circumstance, you're suffering,
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:48.160]   you're persecuted, and you've been chased everywhere.
[00:45:48.160 --> 00:45:50.920]   He says, you've been given and afforded all this
[00:45:50.920 --> 00:45:52.360]   according to the knowledge of God,
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.800]   the mercy of God, and the power of God.
[00:45:54.800 --> 00:45:57.080]   And all of this is being accomplished for you
[00:45:57.080 --> 00:45:59.280]   by the work of the Spirit, the resurrection of Christ,
[00:45:59.280 --> 00:46:01.440]   and through your faith.
[00:46:01.440 --> 00:46:03.200]   This for the purpose of building you up
[00:46:03.200 --> 00:46:06.760]   towards obedience, purifying you for hope,
[00:46:06.760 --> 00:46:10.480]   inheritance, and a salvation that's incredible.
[00:46:10.480 --> 00:46:12.400]   Right?
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:17.240]   That kind of buildup should overpower us
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.400]   to make us feel like, my goodness,
[00:46:21.400 --> 00:46:24.680]   I've lost sight of something so amazing and so great.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.800]   I'm gonna tell you sometimes, you know,
[00:46:28.800 --> 00:46:32.240]   when I counsel people, I get a little bit apprehensive,
[00:46:32.240 --> 00:46:34.920]   because there have been times when you try
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.840]   to counsel individuals, and they're just not hearing it.
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.560]   So I'm not gonna name anybody specific.
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:42.560]   Let's just say they're a guy named John.
[00:46:42.560 --> 00:46:45.120]   I'm not talking about you Johns.
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.440]   All right, let's talk about somebody else.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.640]   Is there a Bart in here?
[00:46:49.640 --> 00:46:54.440]   Okay, so Bart comes in for counseling,
[00:46:54.440 --> 00:46:56.880]   and he's just in a world of hurt.
[00:46:56.880 --> 00:47:00.040]   So he says, oh my goodness, pastor,
[00:47:00.040 --> 00:47:02.800]   there's like everything going wrong.
[00:47:02.800 --> 00:47:04.800]   You know, like I went to work,
[00:47:04.800 --> 00:47:07.360]   and someone jacked my reserve parking spot.
[00:47:07.360 --> 00:47:09.520]   You know, and it's like, okay, big whoop.
[00:47:09.520 --> 00:47:11.240]   And it's like, and that was just an indication
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:13.400]   what's gonna happen, because as they jacked my parking spot,
[00:47:13.400 --> 00:47:14.600]   I go in, and I gotta let go.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:16.440]   I've been given the slip.
[00:47:16.440 --> 00:47:18.000]   I got replaced.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:19.920]   And he says, yeah, and also my wife,
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:22.400]   like she's embittered with me because I was frustrated,
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:25.120]   and then now she's frustrated, and she's mad at me.
[00:47:25.120 --> 00:47:27.320]   And then my kids, they're just driving me crazy.
[00:47:27.320 --> 00:47:29.200]   I'm losing all my hair, and they're not obedient.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.000]   They're causing me all this stress.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:32.400]   And then just the list goes on.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.520]   Da da da da da da da da da da, you know?
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:39.800]   I asked a question earlier of like how Apostle Peter
[00:47:39.800 --> 00:47:43.120]   would encourage the people who are suffering like that.
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:44.600]   And I just kind of played a scenario,
[00:47:44.600 --> 00:47:47.280]   a hypothetical scenario like this in my head.
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.200]   Imagine if to Bart I said, you know,
[00:47:50.200 --> 00:47:52.560]   you have an inheritance that's so much greater.
[00:47:52.560 --> 00:47:55.000]   The scripture says that there is an inheritance for you
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:56.800]   that's imperishable, and I went on.
[00:47:57.720 --> 00:47:59.800]   There are times in which people like Bart
[00:47:59.800 --> 00:48:02.160]   will listen to that, and they might listen,
[00:48:02.160 --> 00:48:06.080]   and what they'll typically say is, yes, yes, I get that.
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:07.320]   If they're bad, they'll say, man,
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:08.560]   don't throw Bible verses at me.
[00:48:08.560 --> 00:48:10.200]   That doesn't help.
[00:48:10.200 --> 00:48:11.880]   At best, they'll say, I get it,
[00:48:11.880 --> 00:48:13.880]   but still, it doesn't help the situation.
[00:48:13.880 --> 00:48:16.680]   Something that I want to encourage us
[00:48:16.680 --> 00:48:19.960]   and challenge us with today is there is something
[00:48:19.960 --> 00:48:24.400]   really wrong, really inappropriate,
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:28.360]   and off about that kind of concept.
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.560]   Because when you have that kind of worldview,
[00:48:30.560 --> 00:48:33.120]   what you're saying is the solution I'm looking for
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:35.200]   is not that kind of hope.
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:37.640]   The solution I'm looking for is not what you're saying
[00:48:37.640 --> 00:48:39.320]   in the passage, in the scriptures,
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:41.640]   in what God has given us in the Holy Spirit,
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:43.960]   and in salvation and redemption.
[00:48:43.960 --> 00:48:45.560]   What that kind of solution is saying,
[00:48:45.560 --> 00:48:49.720]   all I want is the solution of get rid of this for me.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:54.320]   And that's a lot of times what people experience.
[00:48:54.320 --> 00:48:55.840]   The solution that what they're looking for
[00:48:55.840 --> 00:48:58.840]   is remove the difficulty, change the circumstance.
[00:48:58.840 --> 00:49:02.440]   But what Apostle Peter is saying, you have to have faith.
[00:49:02.440 --> 00:49:05.640]   You have to have faith to believe that even the solution,
[00:49:05.640 --> 00:49:08.240]   even if God said, okay, I'll remove that from you,
[00:49:08.240 --> 00:49:10.340]   you have something even greater than that.
[00:49:10.340 --> 00:49:15.040]   You have something greater than just simple peace,
[00:49:15.040 --> 00:49:18.240]   the absence of discomfort, and the removal of all pain.
[00:49:18.240 --> 00:49:22.320]   You have something imperishable.
[00:49:22.320 --> 00:49:23.880]   You have something reserved for you
[00:49:23.880 --> 00:49:28.320]   that no one can touch, that only God can give you.
[00:49:28.320 --> 00:49:30.920]   And that's why he says, so what I wanna give you
[00:49:30.920 --> 00:49:33.840]   is the abounding fullness of grace and peace.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.480]   I skipped it because I wanted to save it for the end.
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:40.680]   Apostle Peter's purpose for us is that we would abound
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.560]   to the full measure of grace and peace in his heart,
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:46.520]   and that grace and peace is not gonna come
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.120]   because we got rid of all the animosity,
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.080]   because we got a lot of friends,
[00:49:51.080 --> 00:49:53.720]   and because we had all the suffering and persecution
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:49:55.880]   removed from our lives.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.600]   Apostle Peter is saying, have this faith and belief
[00:49:58.600 --> 00:50:00.840]   and trust in your heart that you have something
[00:50:00.840 --> 00:50:05.040]   so much greater than the solution you so eagerly
[00:50:05.040 --> 00:50:06.440]   are desiring to seek.
[00:50:06.440 --> 00:50:12.320]   The eradication of discomfort is actually weak
[00:50:12.320 --> 00:50:14.560]   compared to what we have in the gospel, amen?
[00:50:14.560 --> 00:50:18.420]   And so this is the purpose of 1 Peter.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.240]   There's a passage that Apostle Peter says
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.360]   at the very end of the book, 1 Peter chapter five,
[00:50:23.360 --> 00:50:27.120]   verse 12, and he says, through Silvanus,
[00:50:27.120 --> 00:50:29.640]   our faithful brother, for I regard him,
[00:50:29.640 --> 00:50:32.920]   I have written to you briefly, exhorting and testifying
[00:50:32.920 --> 00:50:36.960]   that this is the true grace of God, stam-fer-minent.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.940]   And I am reminded and I'm challenged again.
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:40.920]   Sometimes we're looking for practical advice,
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:42.960]   we're looking for application, all that kind of stuff,
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:45.040]   but it comes back to this conviction again.
[00:50:45.040 --> 00:50:47.120]   Our Christian lives, dealing with suffering,
[00:50:47.120 --> 00:50:50.640]   dealing with persecution, comes down to this, our belief.
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:53.460]   And I was so challenged.
[00:50:53.460 --> 00:50:56.000]   It comes down to those questions of,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:50:58.080]   do I trust that God is still merciful to me
[00:50:58.080 --> 00:51:00.260]   when I feel like there's too much pain?
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.880]   Do I trust that God is still powerful,
[00:51:03.880 --> 00:51:06.960]   that he has chosen with his great foreknowledge?
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.720]   Do I trust that God is ever-present,
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:10.720]   still working by his spirit,
[00:51:10.720 --> 00:51:13.720]   sanctifying me through all of this?
[00:51:13.720 --> 00:51:17.000]   And do I trust that in an incredible way,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.840]   God is moving me towards his end, what he purposed for me?
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:24.200]   It's a question of belief.
[00:51:24.200 --> 00:51:26.400]   And we have to pray and we have to fight
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:29.740]   the battle on the level of, where is my faith?
[00:51:29.740 --> 00:51:35.700]   So I wanna challenge us with this first lesson,
[00:51:35.700 --> 00:51:38.720]   with the theme of the entirety of 1 Peter.
[00:51:38.720 --> 00:51:41.840]   Apostle Peter is going to then address that.
[00:51:41.840 --> 00:51:43.520]   Where is the condition of our faith
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.460]   in this moment of suffering?
[00:51:45.460 --> 00:51:48.800]   And is it one where it's strong and standing firm
[00:51:48.800 --> 00:51:50.580]   in the graces of God?
[00:51:50.580 --> 00:51:51.980]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:51:51.980 --> 00:52:03.560]   Father God, we wanna pray, Lord, that by your spirit,
[00:52:03.560 --> 00:52:06.320]   you would convict us of truth.
[00:52:06.320 --> 00:52:09.480]   And then in your grace, you would remind us of the truth
[00:52:09.480 --> 00:52:12.300]   and allow us to walk daily in it, God.
[00:52:12.300 --> 00:52:15.040]   Lord, we confess and we also repent of the fact
[00:52:15.040 --> 00:52:17.200]   that we are often so forgetful.
[00:52:17.200 --> 00:52:20.480]   We are often so easily distracted.
[00:52:20.480 --> 00:52:23.240]   But I pray, Father God, that we would not live our lives
[00:52:23.240 --> 00:52:28.000]   by our physical sight, but truly that we would live by faith.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:31.060]   God, trusting and believing that the salvation we have
[00:52:31.060 --> 00:52:34.360]   is worth all the sacrifice, is worth all the things
[00:52:34.360 --> 00:52:36.920]   that we have to go through and overcome.
[00:52:36.920 --> 00:52:39.280]   And I pray, Father God, that if there's anybody in here
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:42.000]   who is tempted with quitting, tempted with despairing,
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:44.940]   and tempted with giving up, I ask, Lord,
[00:52:44.940 --> 00:52:46.740]   that these words from Apostle Peter today
[00:52:46.740 --> 00:52:48.520]   would have encouraged their hearts.
[00:52:48.520 --> 00:52:51.200]   That God, you are a God who have been actively working
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:52.800]   since the beginning.
[00:52:52.800 --> 00:52:54.960]   And Lord, you will always accomplish your will,
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:57.760]   no matter how tough the situation seems.
[00:52:57.760 --> 00:52:59.100]   Father, we again wanna thank you
[00:52:59.100 --> 00:53:00.600]   for the encouragement in the spirit.
[00:53:00.600 --> 00:53:02.520]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
