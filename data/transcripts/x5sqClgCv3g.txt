[00:06:55.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   I'll just open up with a word of prayer real quick. Father, we just thank you once again
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   for this time to just come together as a church to just lift the praise to you with song
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   through the study of your word, through the study through this book, and especially this week's
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   study of your word and the covenant Bible study. We just come before you, Lord,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   just holding you with reverence, with true humility, just wanting to lift
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   up our praise to you. We pray that these songs will be
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   just a joyful noise to you here, and that these songs will just glorify you, Lord. We pray all this in Christ's name.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   Amen.

[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   Father, we just thank you for this time of worship.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   These songs that we sing, Lord, are just our prayers as well.
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   We ask that you would take your truth, Lord, plant it deep in us,
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   that it would shape and fashion us in your likeness
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:35.000]   to just show the light of Christ through us,
[00:13:35.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   that, God, you would teach us full obedience,
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   your reverence, your humility,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   that it would truly test our thoughts and our attitudes
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   and cause our faith to rise, Lord, and cause our eyes to see, God,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   that your words of power will never fail.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   And ultimately, Lord, we pray that as we go through your Bible study
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   that it would just fulfill in us all your purposes for your glory,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   just like we sing, God. In Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   We do have a lot of stuff going on this weekend.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   I'd like to highlight for you guys some of the announcements here.
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   First, our youth group is going to be doing a fundraiser lunch
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   after second and third services.

[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   With events like Reformation Night,
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   anything where we are spending the extended time at an event with the children,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   we want all our volunteers to be safety trained,
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   so please make sure that you show up at 1.30 p.m. in the main sanctuary
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   for child safety training.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   You can sign up using that link there.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   If you have any questions, you can send over to Alex Coe there.
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   His email is on the screen.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:32.000]   For the Family Ministry, that Sunday, Sunday the 20th,
[00:15:32.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   there is an extended time of fellowship at Bill Barber Park
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   for a picnic from 11 a.m. to 3 p.m.

[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   so if you're in the Family Ministry, please come out,
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:47.000]   and we'd love to see you and fellowship with you there.
[00:15:47.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   An important one for you guys is that for all the men,

[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   we're going to be having a Men's Ministry Fellowship November 9th.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:00.000]   So it is a little bit away, several weeks out,
[00:16:00.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   but we want to give you guys a heads-up to save that time.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   It's a sweet time of fellowship for the guys to come together and learn.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   It's just $10 a person.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   There's going to be lunch provided,
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   so please make sure you sign up for that as well for all the guys.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   And then we have our regional Thanksgiving fellowship dinner

[01:02:00.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   All right, if the people who are in the rooms begin to get back into your seats,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   we're going to get started real quick.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   [Background conversations]
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   All right, so as they're coming in, before I get started,
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   you guys read the chapter on the elders and deacons, right?
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   Yeah.
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   So I know there's a lot of question, and I'm not going to be addressing that tonight,
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   but I'm going to answer just a few questions, the common questions that come up.
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:40.000]   So if you're not in the room, you're going to have to listen to it later, okay?
[01:02:40.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   So first of all, as you guys know, we are an elder-run church.
[01:02:44.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Typically, a Baptist church is not an elder-run church.
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   It's a congregational church, but our church is more of a Reformed Baptist church,
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   so we are an elder-run church.
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   What that means is the role of the elders are to govern the church, to teach the church.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   So basically, the leaders of the church are the elders.
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:10.000]   And then the deacons serve to help the elders do their work and to assist,
[01:03:10.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   and that's the role of a deacon.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   And so one common question people ask is what is the difference between an elder and a pastor, right?
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:22.000]   The Bible does not distinguish between an elder and a pastor.
[01:03:22.000 --> 01:03:29.000]   The word "elder," "shepherd," and "overseer" are all the same titles that are used in the Bible.
[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   Now, the Bible gives general outlines of what to do, like the qualification of an elder.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:43.000]   But how it ought to be, ought to be practiced, in what context, it doesn't give you the specifics.
[01:03:43.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   It just gives you the qualification of an elder, but not to lay hands hastily.
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:50.000]   These are the qualities of an elder, right?
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:04:00.000]   And so at our church specifically, the elders of the church are the ones who make decisions, doctrinal statements,
[01:04:00.000 --> 01:04:03.000]   handle finances, and govern the church.
[01:04:03.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   Not all pastors are elders.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:14.000]   And the reason why is pastors are ordained, and they may, you know, whether it's a year or two, just like PPC,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:17.000]   they can always go to another church.
[01:04:17.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Elders are elders and leaders specific for this church only, so they don't go down the street as an elder.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   They're elders specifically for this particular church.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   The distinction between, within the elders, the elders who are primarily teaching versus elders who are governing,
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:39.000]   the Bible distinguishes between the two, right?
[01:04:39.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   So at our church, an elder who is teaching needs to have seminary education, needs to be properly ordained,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   and so that's how those are things that are in our bylaw.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   Our pastors will most likely at some point become elders of our church.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:59.000]   But again, the reason why we distinguish that is because we can't have, let's say,
[01:04:59.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   if we end up hiring 15 staff at our church, we can't have our youth pastor, our elementary director, our college director,
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   and every pastor that comes into our church have equal say as to what our doctrines are going to be.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:16.000]   Does that make sense?
[01:05:16.000 --> 01:05:21.000]   Because those pastors may be here in two years and maybe go out to mission field or something,
[01:05:21.000 --> 01:05:31.000]   but we can't have leadership in the church that's going to lay foundations in the church who are not long-term committed here.
[01:05:31.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   So for practical reasons, we make that distinction.
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   So when we recognize that a pastor seems to be more permanent than not,
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   then all the other qualifications obviously they need to have to be a pastor,
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:49.000]   and at some point we will consider making them an elder.
[01:05:49.000 --> 01:05:51.000]   So those are common questions that we get.
[01:05:51.000 --> 01:05:54.000]   Another question we get is how come we don't practice deaconship?
[01:05:54.000 --> 01:05:59.000]   At one point we did, and I don't want to get into the long story behind that,
[01:05:59.000 --> 01:06:06.000]   but deacons basically, some people think that deaconship is like the government.
[01:06:06.000 --> 01:06:09.000]   You have the executive branch, you have the legislative branch, you have the judicial branch,
[01:06:09.000 --> 01:06:13.000]   and so you have different branches in the church for checks and balances.
[01:06:13.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   It's completely not from the Bible. Not a single sentence of that I said is from the Bible.
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   So if you have that kind of thinking, you got it from somewhere, but it's not from the Bible.
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:31.000]   Deacons were created in the scripture to assist the elders so that the elders can focus on prayer and teaching.
[01:06:31.000 --> 01:06:34.000]   That's where it comes from.
[01:06:34.000 --> 01:06:37.000]   So when people say how come we don't have deacons,
[01:06:37.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   the term deacon is basically a servant.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   So when you say how come we don't have deacons, how come we don't have servants,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   our church is filled with servants, right?
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   Every month we have a servant leaders meeting at church.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   So the proper question is how come we don't use the term deacon?
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:04.000]   So we have many deacons at church, but we haven't used the term deacon.
[01:07:04.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   We haven't given the title deacon, and part of the reason why we haven't given the title deacon
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   is because we're trying to distinguish what is the difference
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   when we give a title to a deacon versus others who are serving.
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   How are we going to distinguish that?
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   So what is the distinction between a service team leader who is serving faithfully,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   like anybody else, between somebody who's given a title deacon?
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   And so we haven't come to a biblical conclusion on that
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   other than we need to give a title because we should practice deaconship.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:43.000]   So in every way at our church we practice deaconship,
[01:07:43.000 --> 01:07:47.000]   we just haven't come to a good reason why the title needs to be used,
[01:07:47.000 --> 01:07:49.000]   at least at this point, right?
[01:07:49.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   So hopefully that answers your question.
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   Today we're going to be going into the covenant number five,
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   and hopefully at some point we have an open Q&A
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   where you guys can ask more detailed questions about that.
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   But for now, because you read that chapter, I wanted to give you a brief answer.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:09.000]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll jump in.
[01:08:09.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   Father, I pray for deeper understanding as we wrestle over the covenant number five
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   and what it means for our church as we continue to grow and add souls to our church,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:23.000]   help us to grow purposefully.
[01:08:23.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   Whether we've been here for many years or whether we are new to the church,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   I pray that you would continue to strengthen us, that we may be united as one,
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   that we may have clear understanding of what it is that we are trying to build at this church.
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   All right, so the covenant number five is,
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   "I commit to attending and preparing for weekday Bible studies to the best of my ability
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:47.000]   for the purpose of building up the body of Christ at Berean."
[01:08:47.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   So when you become a member of our church, we require this,
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   and we go over this covenant and ask you to fulfill this every year.
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   So if we have people at our church who are members of our church
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   and who's consistently not taking the Bible study seriously,
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   obviously you will eventually get an email or some sort of follow-up saying,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   "Hey, are you planning to take the covenant seriously?"
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   And I'm going to be explaining why we do this,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:24.000]   because every part of the tenfold covenant in our church is the bare minimum.
[01:09:24.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   And I don't know what your Christian life was before you came to this church,
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:29.000]   but this is the bare minimum.
[01:09:29.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   We didn't add anything in the tenfold covenant that you do not see,
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   at least different teachings of it, all over Scripture.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   A Christian cannot be a serious Christian if he is not regularly in the Word of God,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   individually and corporately.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   You cannot be growing, you cannot be maturing, you cannot be participating.
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:55.000]   So this idea of, "I want to go to church, I want to worship God,
[01:09:55.000 --> 01:09:59.000]   but I want to worship God on my terms, when it's convenient for me.
[01:09:59.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   So if it's not convenient for me, then I don't need to go.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   So I want to go to a church where everybody just comes and goes as they please,
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   and that's free worship, and that's what grace means."
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:12.000]   No, that's not what that means.
[01:10:12.000 --> 01:10:16.000]   So that's what I want to explain, why this covenant is here.
[01:10:16.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   When we said, "To the best of your ability,"
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:22.000]   obviously we understand that work, there's family stuff going on,
[01:10:22.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   there's different things that may happen that is beyond your control,
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   but we're asking to the best of your ability to commit to your faith.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:33.000]   We're not saying just to bring in, "Commit to your faith,"
[01:10:33.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   where your faith is not just, "I feel this for my Jesus."
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:40.000]   What does that mean?
[01:10:40.000 --> 01:10:46.000]   Part of it means to participate in building and growing your faith.
[01:10:46.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   The philosophy behind the preaching and teaching on Sunday
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   and weekday Bible study is different at our church.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   Sunday is to get the Word of God in you.
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Sunday is to get the Word of God in you.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:07.000]   I'm sharing something very specific.
[01:11:07.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   Can you even see?
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   I made it too small.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   So if Jubilee can see, then everybody can see.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   [laughter]
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   All right.
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   I want you to understand, at least in my ministry philosophy,
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   of the distinction between Sunday philosophy and weekday philosophy.
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   Sunday teaching philosophy is to get the Word of God in you.
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   Weekday philosophy is to get you into the Word.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   Now, what does that mean?
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   Sunday sermons are geared toward proclamation, preaching.
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   There is a distinction between preaching and teaching.
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   Let me share what I mean by that.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   Jesus says that he's looking for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:06.000]   meaning your heart condition, your life, your intention,
[01:12:06.000 --> 01:12:13.000]   and your application of the things that you're learning is just as important as what you are learning.
[01:12:13.000 --> 01:12:18.000]   So the purpose of Sunday preaching is for the purpose of proclamation.
[01:12:18.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   You can learn every aspect of that passage
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   and never come out with any conclusion, any application.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   So Sunday sermons are for the purpose of proclaiming
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   so that those who hear may be convicted and apply what they are learning.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   That's the purpose of Sunday.
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   I'm going to share with you the distinction between proclaiming and teaching.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   Because that's the goal, when we are studying through a text,
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   it is not my goal to get everything that is in the text to you.
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:06.000]   So there might be a text where there's five separate points,
[01:13:06.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   and my goal in preaching on Sunday is not to make sure that every part of that text is dissected
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   and you understand all of it because the themes are different.
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   There may be different things that don't fit in.
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   So as I do the study, there's huge chunks of the study that sometimes I may not put in
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   because the main point of it is obedience.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   Because Christ's main point in that text is to pick up your cross.
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:37.000]   So I don't feel the need to sit there and explain to you every aspect of that cross
[01:13:37.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   in order for you to understand that text because that's not the philosophy behind Sunday.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   It's for proclamation and for obedience.
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:48.000]   So there are some things that will be put in and some things that will be left out.
[01:13:48.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   That's on Sunday.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:13:53.000]   The Word of God is being taught, but it's for the purpose of proclaiming.
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:57.000]   Now, weekday Bible study is to get you into the Word.
[01:13:57.000 --> 01:14:01.000]   So to get you into the Word, you need to understand the text.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:08.000]   So the purpose of weekday Bible study is so that you understand all that is in the text.
[01:14:08.000 --> 01:14:12.000]   And the theme may not be cohesive sometimes.
[01:14:12.000 --> 01:14:16.000]   Paul may have five different points or three different points or various different points
[01:14:16.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   that may not be all easily identifiably connected.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   But the goal of the weekday Bible study is so that you would learn how to get into the Bible yourself.
[01:14:27.000 --> 01:14:30.000]   Does that make sense?
[01:14:30.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   Is the AC on?
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Yeah, it doesn't feel like it's on.
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:39.000]   Can somebody go touch the AC?
[01:14:39.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   Somebody who knows how to touch the AC?
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   Okay.
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:53.000]   Was it off?
[01:14:53.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   It was on?
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:57.000]   If it was on, can you turn the fan?
[01:14:57.000 --> 01:15:01.000]   If you're hot over there, it's much hotter over here.
[01:15:01.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   Okay.
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   All right.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   I don't want you falling asleep.
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   All right.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   So weekday Bible study is to get you into the Bible, right?
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:13.000]   Where Sunday's philosophy is to get the Bible into you.
[01:15:13.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   And so the philosophy is give a man a fish, he'll be satisfied.
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:23.000]   But teach a man to fish, he'll be set for life, right?
[01:15:23.000 --> 01:15:28.000]   And so the philosophy behind Sunday is to feed you the fish.
[01:15:28.000 --> 01:15:32.000]   The philosophy behind weekday Bible study is to get you to learn how to fish.
[01:15:32.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   And that's why we have emphasis on hermeneutics, okay?
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:41.000]   Now, I put all these different groups here because the Mormons, Catholics, the local church,
[01:15:41.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   the Seventh-day Adventist, when you first talk to them, they seem like they know the Bible well, right?
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   But everything they know about the Bible is from either Joseph Smith, whether it's from the Pope or the priest,
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:16:01.000]   or the local church from Witness Lee, or the Seventh-day Adventist from Ellen G. White.
[01:16:01.000 --> 01:16:08.000]   And so when your intake of the Bible is coming from one person or Bible study material,
[01:16:08.000 --> 01:16:13.000]   everything that they believe, you're going to end up believing because you're going to study that like you study the Bible.
[01:16:13.000 --> 01:16:19.000]   That's why I don't think it's wise to study the Bible with a study Bible, okay?
[01:16:19.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   Study Bible is a commentary where somebody's thoughts and theology has been poured into it,
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   so when you read it, you think that's exactly what it says.
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:31.000]   So if they happen to be Calvinist, you're going to be a Calvinist.
[01:16:31.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   If they're Armenian, you're going to be an Armenian.
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:39.000]   If they believe whatever is theology that they have, you're not going to be able to discern
[01:16:39.000 --> 01:16:43.000]   if what they're saying is their opinion or if it's the Word of God.
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   That's why we don't want you first.
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   You can use the commentary to compare your studies, but you cannot study the Bible through the commentary
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   because commentaries is just like listening to a sermon.
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   Somebody else did the study and spoon-feeding you.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:04.000]   Now, that may be useful when you're young, spiritually, but if all your life you're dependent upon somebody else
[01:17:04.000 --> 01:17:13.000]   to tell you what the Bible says, that's how the Catholics had all the Christians captivated for so long.
[01:17:13.000 --> 01:17:19.000]   That's why so many bad doctrines came in and people were not able to discern whether this was from God or not
[01:17:19.000 --> 01:17:21.000]   because the Bible was not taught.
[01:17:21.000 --> 01:17:25.000]   Just trust the priest. They're the ones who are educated. They're the ones who study.
[01:17:25.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   If they say it, it must be from God.
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:32.000]   Until it got so ridiculous, they said, "This can't be from God."
[01:17:32.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   Our weekday philosophy, the emphasis is on hermeneutics, how to interpret the Bible.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:47.000]   What did the author mean and how did the first recipients understand it?
[01:17:47.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   That's the question that we need to constantly ask when we're studying the Bible.
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   We try not to let theology dictate interpretation, but let interpretation dictate theology.
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:04.000]   Sometimes, because you've committed to a set of theology, you look at text and you try to make it fit.
[01:18:04.000 --> 01:18:10.000]   This is the truth of God, and you've been taught theology, and then from that point on,
[01:18:10.000 --> 01:18:13.000]   everything you're looking at, you're looking at through that lens.
[01:18:13.000 --> 01:18:17.000]   You're proof-texting theology that you've already committed to.
[01:18:17.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   "I'm a Baptist. I'm a Presbyterian. I'm a Calvinist. I'm this. I'm that."
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:27.000]   Once you have that, everything is tested by, "Does it fit this theology that I committed to?"
[01:18:27.000 --> 01:18:30.000]   But why did you commit to that theology?
[01:18:30.000 --> 01:18:33.000]   Did you commit to that theology from your careful study of the Word of God
[01:18:33.000 --> 01:18:37.000]   and the theology was formulated as a result of studying and handling the Word of God?
[01:18:37.000 --> 01:18:42.000]   Or was a theology given to you, and once you put that on,
[01:18:42.000 --> 01:18:47.000]   everything that you hear and learn has to be through that lens?
[01:18:47.000 --> 01:18:54.000]   I would say most Christians, if they're honest with themselves, does the latter.
[01:18:54.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   It's not safe, especially today.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   It is not safe that you do not learn how to discern truth for yourself,
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:09.000]   because so many bad doctrines, so many bad theologies,
[01:19:09.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   so many pastors and seminaries who have perverted the Word of God,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   that if you don't learn to discern, you will be deceived.
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   Remember what it says in Matthew 24, "In the last times, the deception is going to be so great
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:32.000]   that if possible, even the elect will be deceived."
[01:19:32.000 --> 01:19:35.000]   That's how powerful the deception is going to be.
[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:39.000]   If you don't learn to test and discern the truth for yourself,
[01:19:39.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   how do you know if I'm not?
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   How do you know because you just happen to be, "I think he's a good guy"?
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:52.000]   That's not enough to be able to discern truth.
[01:19:52.000 --> 01:19:57.000]   You must practice exegesis versus eisegesis.
[01:19:57.000 --> 01:20:02.000]   Exegesis is basically studying the text, asking the questions, applying hermeneutics,
[01:20:02.000 --> 01:20:07.000]   and then extrapolating what it says in the text.
[01:20:07.000 --> 01:20:10.000]   Eisegesis is you have an agenda.
[01:20:10.000 --> 01:20:12.000]   This is what the Bible should say.
[01:20:12.000 --> 01:20:15.000]   This is how things ought to be, and you're looking for something
[01:20:15.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   because you've already committed to something because somebody told you,
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:23.000]   or you read something, or you happen to go to this church,
[01:20:23.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   or you grew up a Baptist, you grew up a Presbyterian,
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:27.000]   and so now you're using that lens.
[01:20:27.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   Your litmus test is your theology.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   Your litmus test needs to be the Word of God, not your theology
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:37.000]   or whatever bent that you may have.
[01:20:37.000 --> 01:20:43.000]   That's what I mean by exegesis rather than eisegesis.
[01:20:43.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   That's why at Church Our Size,
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   we have so many people coming from all different backgrounds,
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   and they'll say, "Oh, how come our church doesn't do this?
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:52.000]   How come our church doesn't do that?"
[01:20:52.000 --> 01:20:58.000]   Well, where did you get that from Scripture?
[01:20:58.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   My old church, my old pastor.
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   Okay, so your whole faith is based upon your old church then,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   and your whole faith is based upon your old pastor.
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   No, then where did you get it?
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   What were you reading?
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   What text were you wrestling with that caused you to say,
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   "This is the way it should be"?
[01:21:21.000 --> 01:21:24.000]   Because that happens so often in the church, I always test you.
[01:21:24.000 --> 01:21:27.000]   If you are going to ask me a question and you're going to challenge me,
[01:21:27.000 --> 01:21:32.000]   the next question you're going to receive is, "Where did you get that?"
[01:21:32.000 --> 01:21:38.000]   I want to challenge you to make sure that it's not eisegesis but exegesis.
[01:21:38.000 --> 01:21:42.000]   You have to let the Word of God judge your thoughts and intentions
[01:21:42.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   and let your thoughts dictate your interpretation.
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:52.000]   So that's our philosophy of weekday Bible study.
[01:21:52.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   Why is this important?
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   Making disciples requires consistent and regular Bible study.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   The Great Commission says to go, baptize,
[01:22:01.000 --> 01:22:05.000]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[01:22:05.000 --> 01:22:10.000]   Obedience to Scripture is commanded, a part of discipleship.
[01:22:10.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   It's not just, "You know what? Here's a set of doctrines.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   Jesus loved me, died for me because I could not, and I accept that.
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   If I keep repeating that to myself, then that's what discipleship is.
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:26.000]   Just repeat the first phase of Christ died for me, Christ died for me,
[01:22:26.000 --> 01:22:28.000]   my salvation is secure."
[01:22:28.000 --> 01:22:34.000]   No. He says, "Go, baptize, teach them to observe all that I have commanded you."
[01:22:34.000 --> 01:22:38.000]   But discipleship is not simply disseminating the Gospel.
[01:22:38.000 --> 01:22:40.000]   It's living the Gospel.
[01:22:40.000 --> 01:22:43.000]   Now that you've accepted the Gospel, now that you're a Christian,
[01:22:43.000 --> 01:22:45.000]   what does that mean for you in your life?
[01:22:45.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   That's why Bible study always ends with application.
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   That's why teaching always ends in application.
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   What does that mean for you?
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   How are you going to apply that?
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   Discipleship is not just proclaiming the Gospel,
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:23:01.000]   but also teaching how you ought to live your life.
[01:23:01.000 --> 01:23:04.000]   Discipleship begins with teaching how we ought to think,
[01:23:04.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   but must move to how those thoughts move to practice.
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   So if all you do is study and get all the right understanding of the Scripture,
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:17.000]   but there was no change in your life, you're not growing in your faith.
[01:23:17.000 --> 01:23:19.000]   It doesn't matter how much knowledge you have.
[01:23:19.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   In fact, it's probably doing more damage than good.
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:29.000]   All right, for the sake of time, I'm not going to go through this.
[01:23:29.000 --> 01:23:36.000]   Just briefly, how can a young man keep his way pure?
[01:23:36.000 --> 01:23:41.000]   The word "pure" typically, people think that that word talks about sexual purity.
[01:23:41.000 --> 01:23:45.000]   It's a much more general word than that, sexual purity obviously included.
[01:23:45.000 --> 01:23:49.000]   The word "pure" basically means moral, righteousness.
[01:23:49.000 --> 01:23:53.000]   How can a young man keep his way righteous before God, holy?
[01:23:53.000 --> 01:23:55.000]   By keeping it according to your word.
[01:23:55.000 --> 01:23:59.000]   Holiness and intake of the word is directly related.
[01:23:59.000 --> 01:24:03.000]   With all my heart, I have sought you.
[01:24:03.000 --> 01:24:08.000]   The purpose of studying the word of God is not simply to know what the word of God says,
[01:24:08.000 --> 01:24:12.000]   but through the word of God to seek Him, to seek Christ.
[01:24:12.000 --> 01:24:17.000]   At the end of your study, if you do not come nearer to Christ,
[01:24:17.000 --> 01:24:21.000]   you have not done anything other than added knowledge.
[01:24:21.000 --> 01:24:23.000]   The goal of the study is to seek Him.
[01:24:23.000 --> 01:24:25.000]   Do not let me wander from your commandment.
[01:24:25.000 --> 01:24:28.000]   Your word I have treasured in my heart that I may not sin against you.
[01:24:28.000 --> 01:24:30.000]   Teach me your statutes with my lips.
[01:24:30.000 --> 01:24:32.000]   I have told of all the ordinances of your mouth.
[01:24:32.000 --> 01:24:37.000]   So not only did I learn, I opened my mouth to teach others.
[01:24:37.000 --> 01:24:40.000]   I have rejoiced in the way of the testimonies as much as in all riches.
[01:24:40.000 --> 01:24:43.000]   I will meditate on your precepts and regard your ways.
[01:24:43.000 --> 01:24:44.000]   I shall delight in your study.
[01:24:44.000 --> 01:24:45.000]   I shall not forget your words.
[01:24:45.000 --> 01:24:49.000]   So all of it is that how can a young man keep his way pure, be righteous and holy?
[01:24:49.000 --> 01:24:51.000]   By keeping it according to the word.
[01:24:51.000 --> 01:24:53.000]   Through the word, I have sought you.
[01:24:53.000 --> 01:24:54.000]   I've meditated.
[01:24:54.000 --> 01:24:58.000]   I learned, and then I taught so that I would not forget.
[01:24:58.000 --> 01:25:02.000]   And I would treasure this in my heart, and it would end in delight.
[01:25:02.000 --> 01:25:07.000]   So all of that is what Bible study is for.
[01:25:07.000 --> 01:25:11.000]   We're not simply studying so that you can have a better understanding of Philippians or Philemon
[01:25:11.000 --> 01:25:14.000]   or who was Paul and what was his theology.
[01:25:14.000 --> 01:25:19.000]   The purpose of all of that is so that we may live holy and godly lives,
[01:25:19.000 --> 01:25:21.000]   honoring God and loving Christ.
[01:25:21.000 --> 01:25:26.000]   So if the deep study of the word of God doesn't cause you to have deeper affection for Christ,
[01:25:26.000 --> 01:25:31.000]   then you missed the whole point of the Bible study.
[01:25:31.000 --> 01:25:36.000]   The strength and health of the church is directly linked to the members being able to test what they are hearing
[01:25:36.000 --> 01:25:39.000]   and accept what they are learning is ultimately from God.
[01:25:39.000 --> 01:25:44.000]   Like I said, it is not enough that the elders are testing, right?
[01:25:44.000 --> 01:25:48.000]   Because the elders are human beings.
[01:25:48.000 --> 01:25:50.000]   We can be an error, right?
[01:25:50.000 --> 01:25:57.000]   In my lifetime, I've seen three or four major, major cultural things that came in.
[01:25:57.000 --> 01:26:03.000]   Again, I mentioned to you up in the pulpit, I got saved at the tail end of the Jesus movement.
[01:26:03.000 --> 01:26:06.000]   And then the holiness discipleship movement came in.
[01:26:06.000 --> 01:26:09.000]   And then after that, the charismatic movement came in.
[01:26:09.000 --> 01:26:12.000]   After the charismatic movement came in, the seeker-friendly movement came in.
[01:26:12.000 --> 01:26:15.000]   After the seeker-friendly, the young restless and reform movement came in.
[01:26:15.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   After that movement came in, the gospel-centered movement came in.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:25.000]   And then recently, all this, you know, the political stuff, you know, that movement came in.
[01:26:25.000 --> 01:26:30.000]   So every one of these things, I've seen people get swept up in that.
[01:26:30.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   All of a sudden, they were doing fine, and then all of a sudden, with a snap of a finger,
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:39.000]   how they determine what was right and wrong, what they need to do, how churches need to change.
[01:26:39.000 --> 01:26:45.000]   Every time a movement came in, and usually with young people, and they get swept,
[01:26:45.000 --> 01:26:49.000]   it means that all this time I was wrong, and all of a sudden, they opened their eyes,
[01:26:49.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   and then they started to see the whole world through that lens.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   And Satan has a way of using movements to get you off your track.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:03.000]   And that's why we have to keep our eyes on Scripture, right?
[01:27:03.000 --> 01:27:07.000]   Movement at the core is correcting what's wrong.
[01:27:07.000 --> 01:27:13.000]   But typically, what happens with young people, they almost always overcorrect
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:16.000]   because they don't know where the center is.
[01:27:16.000 --> 01:27:20.000]   So if you are not grounded and anchored in the Word of God,
[01:27:20.000 --> 01:27:25.000]   whatever movement comes in, you're going to get swept away because you're going to see a tide.
[01:27:25.000 --> 01:27:29.000]   You're going to see a movement. It's going to be popular to hold on to certain views.
[01:27:29.000 --> 01:27:34.000]   So the only way to survive these things is to be anchored in the Bible.
[01:27:34.000 --> 01:27:38.000]   You have to be able to discern. How do you test if you've gone too far?
[01:27:38.000 --> 01:27:41.000]   How do you test if this is biblical or not biblical?
[01:27:41.000 --> 01:27:43.000]   You have to be able to discern, right?
[01:27:43.000 --> 01:27:47.000]   Thessalonians 2.13, for this reason, we also constantly thank God
[01:27:47.000 --> 01:27:50.000]   that when you receive the Word of God, you heard it from us,
[01:27:50.000 --> 01:27:54.000]   you accepted it not as the Word of men, but for what it really is, the Word of God,
[01:27:54.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   which also performs its work.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:28:01.000]   So it says Thessalonians were a model church because they received the Word of God as God's Word.
[01:28:01.000 --> 01:28:05.000]   But then Acts 17.11, it says they were more noble.
[01:28:05.000 --> 01:28:08.000]   The Bereans were nobleminded than the Thessalonians
[01:28:08.000 --> 01:28:13.000]   because when they received it, they tested it by the Word of God.
[01:28:13.000 --> 01:28:18.000]   So here's a model church, but here's a church that he said commends even further
[01:28:18.000 --> 01:28:25.000]   because they didn't just accept it, they tested it with the Word of God.
[01:28:25.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   All right, this I'm not going to read for the sake of time.
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:34.000]   It says, "Beloved, do not believe every spirit, but test the spirits to see whether they are from God,
[01:28:34.000 --> 01:28:37.000]   because many false prophets have gone out into the world."
[01:28:37.000 --> 01:28:39.000]   So this has been true from the beginning,
[01:28:39.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   but I believe today we're in much more danger than they were in the early church.
[01:28:45.000 --> 01:28:50.000]   So many bad doctrines, so many bad teaching has gone out
[01:28:50.000 --> 01:28:55.000]   that even in a biblical church, what is and isn't from the Bible,
[01:28:55.000 --> 01:29:01.000]   we have to constantly test, where did you get that from the Bible?
[01:29:01.000 --> 01:29:06.000]   How do we test it? How do we test the spirits?
[01:29:06.000 --> 01:29:08.000]   I'm going to give you some things not to do.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:12.000]   Don't test it by how it makes you feel.
[01:29:12.000 --> 01:29:15.000]   Oh, you said this and I felt this way.
[01:29:15.000 --> 01:29:17.000]   That's not a good test.
[01:29:17.000 --> 01:29:20.000]   Your feeling can change because of the weather.
[01:29:20.000 --> 01:29:25.000]   Your feeling can change because somebody said something not nice to you.
[01:29:25.000 --> 01:29:27.000]   That's how fickle our feelings are.
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:32.000]   You watch a romantic movie and all of a sudden you love everybody.
[01:29:32.000 --> 01:29:35.000]   You can't trust your feelings.
[01:29:35.000 --> 01:29:39.000]   Feelings are not bad when it comes along with truth,
[01:29:39.000 --> 01:29:42.000]   but feelings are not a good test of what is right and wrong.
[01:29:42.000 --> 01:29:47.000]   So don't say, "Oh, it made me feel this way. I don't like it. I prefer this."
[01:29:47.000 --> 01:29:50.000]   Well, what's that based on? It's just, "I just prefer this."
[01:29:50.000 --> 01:29:53.000]   That's your feeling. Don't test it by your feeling.
[01:29:53.000 --> 01:29:57.000]   Don't test it by what consequences may come from it.
[01:29:57.000 --> 01:29:59.000]   If I believe this, then what about this?
[01:29:59.000 --> 01:30:02.000]   What if it divides? What if they don't like it?
[01:30:02.000 --> 01:30:09.000]   What if people get offended? That's not a good litmus test, whether it's truth.
[01:30:09.000 --> 01:30:13.000]   And sometimes speaking the truth and holding on to the truth will divide.
[01:30:13.000 --> 01:30:16.000]   People will be offended. The Bible says they will.
[01:30:16.000 --> 01:30:18.000]   You don't need to be offensive.
[01:30:18.000 --> 01:30:24.000]   You don't need to cling to be offensive or divisive or be a jerk.
[01:30:24.000 --> 01:30:29.000]   But if you speak the truth, it will always divide.
[01:30:29.000 --> 01:30:34.000]   Don't test it by what you have become accustomed to.
[01:30:34.000 --> 01:30:37.000]   This is what I was taught. This is what I always knew.
[01:30:37.000 --> 01:30:41.000]   That's from my church. This is from my parents.
[01:30:41.000 --> 01:30:47.000]   It's not safe simply to test something based upon the set of facts that you've already received.
[01:30:47.000 --> 01:30:51.000]   Where did that come from? Why do we do that?
[01:30:51.000 --> 01:30:56.000]   Where is that based on? Is it coming from Scripture or is it coming from tradition?
[01:30:56.000 --> 01:31:01.000]   Don't test it by popular opinion just because everybody embraces it.
[01:31:01.000 --> 01:31:07.000]   There's a movement that came in and all the popular pastors, all the mega church pastors, they're doing this.
[01:31:07.000 --> 01:31:12.000]   All the Bible teaching pastors, they're holding on to this.
[01:31:12.000 --> 01:31:15.000]   It's good to compare. It's always to see, but it's not safe.
[01:31:15.000 --> 01:31:20.000]   You don't test truth based upon how many people agree with you.
[01:31:20.000 --> 01:31:26.000]   Think about that. Even Apostle Peter and Barnabas had to be rebuked.
[01:31:26.000 --> 01:31:28.000]   The first apostles.
[01:31:28.000 --> 01:31:33.000]   It's not safe simply to say because they believe it, because this is my tradition.
[01:31:33.000 --> 01:31:37.000]   Where did you get that from the Bible? Where in the Bible did you get that?
[01:31:37.000 --> 01:31:41.000]   Don't test it by a leader that you admire.
[01:31:41.000 --> 01:31:44.000]   It's good to ask. It's good to compare.
[01:31:44.000 --> 01:31:50.000]   But that's not where your final conclusion should be coming from. It should be coming from Scripture.
[01:31:50.000 --> 01:31:54.000]   Don't simply test it by a system of theology you have come to accept.
[01:31:54.000 --> 01:31:57.000]   I'm a Calvinist, so I must believe this.
[01:31:57.000 --> 01:32:01.000]   I'm a dispensation or I'm a covenant, so I believe this because of that.
[01:32:01.000 --> 01:32:04.000]   Well, where did you get that?
[01:32:04.000 --> 01:32:09.000]   Where in the Scripture did you come to that conviction?
[01:32:09.000 --> 01:32:12.000]   What are some ways that bad doctrine comes into the church?
[01:32:12.000 --> 01:32:17.000]   The most obvious, men ordained into ministry without proper testing.
[01:32:17.000 --> 01:32:21.000]   People who had laid hands hastily.
[01:32:21.000 --> 01:32:29.000]   Today, in our environment, if you want to be a pastor, just go sign up at some seminary.
[01:32:29.000 --> 01:32:31.000]   Maybe do it online.
[01:32:31.000 --> 01:32:37.000]   And then when you see a job opportunity that's open, send in your resume.
[01:32:37.000 --> 01:32:45.000]   If you speak English and you give somewhat coherent of a message,
[01:32:45.000 --> 01:32:52.000]   and you make eye contact with people when you talk, you're hired.
[01:32:52.000 --> 01:32:55.000]   You can find a job somewhere.
[01:32:55.000 --> 01:32:58.000]   Once you get in, you're a pastor.
[01:32:58.000 --> 01:33:02.000]   And how dare any other pastor question you?
[01:33:02.000 --> 01:33:05.000]   Because that's how you get in.
[01:33:05.000 --> 01:33:09.000]   You're not going to get in here like that in our church.
[01:33:09.000 --> 01:33:15.000]   But that's how I got in.
[01:33:15.000 --> 01:33:18.000]   That door was wide open.
[01:33:18.000 --> 01:33:19.000]   I didn't get tested.
[01:33:19.000 --> 01:33:20.000]   I was 19 years old.
[01:33:20.000 --> 01:33:22.000]   They told me to go teach these kids.
[01:33:22.000 --> 01:33:26.000]   I said, "Okay, they're going to pay me? Sure."
[01:33:26.000 --> 01:33:30.000]   I felt weird in the beginning, but they're going to pay me.
[01:33:30.000 --> 01:33:34.000]   Either that or I'd be a janitor for 10 hours a week.
[01:33:34.000 --> 01:33:39.000]   I'm being silly, but it's not that far from the truth.
[01:33:39.000 --> 01:33:43.000]   You have people who may, for whatever the reason, they're coming in,
[01:33:43.000 --> 01:33:45.000]   and maybe they started out with a good reason,
[01:33:45.000 --> 01:33:47.000]   and they got corrupt after they got in.
[01:33:47.000 --> 01:33:50.000]   But the primary reason why the church has become corrupt
[01:33:50.000 --> 01:33:54.000]   is there's people who came into the ministry who shouldn't have been.
[01:33:54.000 --> 01:33:57.000]   They haven't been tested.
[01:33:57.000 --> 01:34:00.000]   The Bible and I have been having a high place in teaching in the church.
[01:34:00.000 --> 01:34:01.000]   Now, why is that?
[01:34:01.000 --> 01:34:05.000]   Because the people who came in were more concerned about opinions of men.
[01:34:05.000 --> 01:34:07.000]   They're servants of men rather than servants of God,
[01:34:07.000 --> 01:34:12.000]   so they didn't put the Bible high priority because the people weren't coming.
[01:34:12.000 --> 01:34:14.000]   This generation of people don't seem interested in the Bible,
[01:34:14.000 --> 01:34:18.000]   so in order for my church to succeed, I've got to lessen this,
[01:34:18.000 --> 01:34:22.000]   and I have to be more receiving of people.
[01:34:22.000 --> 01:34:25.000]   So the Bible slowly started leaking out of the church.
[01:34:25.000 --> 01:34:27.000]   I've heard pastors just straight up say, "We don't do Bible study
[01:34:27.000 --> 01:34:33.000]   because if we do Bible study, people are going to leave."
[01:34:33.000 --> 01:34:37.000]   Where is the "preach the word in season and out of season"?
[01:34:37.000 --> 01:34:40.000]   That these men should not be in there.
[01:34:40.000 --> 01:34:45.000]   Ignorance of the congregation of the Bible to discern what is biblical or not biblical.
[01:34:45.000 --> 01:34:49.000]   So you have a church filled with people who idolizes an individual
[01:34:49.000 --> 01:34:55.000]   or a megachurch pastor or somebody that they love,
[01:34:55.000 --> 01:34:59.000]   and then they start going astray, you start going astray.
[01:34:59.000 --> 01:35:03.000]   They start saying weird things, and you start accepting weird things.
[01:35:03.000 --> 01:35:06.000]   And then when they fall apart, you fall apart,
[01:35:06.000 --> 01:35:10.000]   because your whole faith was based upon somebody that you idolized.
[01:35:10.000 --> 01:35:13.000]   It's not safe to do that.
[01:35:13.000 --> 01:35:17.000]   So I will never tell you to trust me.
[01:35:17.000 --> 01:35:22.000]   I will ask you to test me, but test me with the word.
[01:35:22.000 --> 01:35:24.000]   Don't test me with your opinion.
[01:35:24.000 --> 01:35:26.000]   Don't test me with your experience.
[01:35:26.000 --> 01:35:28.000]   Don't test me with your tradition.
[01:35:28.000 --> 01:35:29.000]   Test me with the word of God.
[01:35:29.000 --> 01:35:32.000]   If you see something off, tell me where it's off.
[01:35:32.000 --> 01:35:35.000]   What is it that you're studying that caused you to see
[01:35:35.000 --> 01:35:39.000]   that this is something that maybe needs to be tested?
[01:35:39.000 --> 01:35:40.000]   We should be tested.
[01:35:40.000 --> 01:35:43.000]   I don't want to build a church based upon my strong opinion.
[01:35:43.000 --> 01:35:46.000]   I want to build a church based upon His word.
[01:35:46.000 --> 01:35:50.000]   So if there's a blind spot that we don't see based upon the word of God,
[01:35:50.000 --> 01:35:54.000]   the church would be healthier if the whole church is able to test the word of God
[01:35:54.000 --> 01:35:58.000]   and to be able to correct and challenge the leaders in the church
[01:35:58.000 --> 01:36:02.000]   with the word, not your opinion.
[01:36:02.000 --> 01:36:05.000]   Not taking doctrine seriously.
[01:36:05.000 --> 01:36:10.000]   Now, there is, because people handle the word of God and doctrine
[01:36:10.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   to point and to divide and to judge other people,
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   the doctrine kind of has taken a bad hit.
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:22.000]   Doctrine basically is a study of God.
[01:36:22.000 --> 01:36:27.000]   And so the system of theology came as people started to accumulate
[01:36:27.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   their knowledge about who God is.
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:31.000]   That's where we get Trinity, right?
[01:36:31.000 --> 01:36:32.000]   That's where we get election.
[01:36:32.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   That's where we get predestination.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:36.000]   So doctrine doesn't divide.
[01:36:36.000 --> 01:36:39.000]   Doctrine unites.
[01:36:39.000 --> 01:36:44.000]   When doctrine is handled by fleshly men, it divides.
[01:36:44.000 --> 01:36:47.000]   But the word of God actually unites.
[01:36:47.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   Every time I run into whoever it is, whatever background it is,
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:56.000]   and they study the Bible passage to passage with learning the context,
[01:36:56.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   I don't even have to ask them.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:03.000]   We're almost in full agreement, almost in full agreement.
[01:37:03.000 --> 01:37:04.000]   We didn't go to the same theology.
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   We grew up in different churches, different background.
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:11.000]   But if they handle the word of God the same way I handle the word of God,
[01:37:11.000 --> 01:37:16.000]   I find, man, the word of God is not as complex and divisive as people think it is.
[01:37:16.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   It's not.
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   Careful study of the word of God actually brings the church together.
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:24.000]   All right, that was it.
[01:37:24.000 --> 01:37:25.000]   Let me finish.
[01:37:25.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   The discussion question for today.
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:32.000]   How faithful do you think you've been in fulfilling the fifth covenant of the church?
[01:37:32.000 --> 01:37:35.000]   Attending the Bible study faithfully.
[01:37:35.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   Do you have a tendency to kind of, you know, whenever something comes up,
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:45.000]   it's only out of convenience do you come, or are you committed to this?
[01:37:45.000 --> 01:37:49.000]   The reason why I--again, I'm not going to do this for the other ones.
[01:37:49.000 --> 01:37:54.000]   The reason why this is being emphasized is because if you're living by the flesh,
[01:37:54.000 --> 01:37:57.000]   then whatever flesh--like your flesh doesn't desire today.
[01:37:57.000 --> 01:37:59.000]   Your flesh wants to do this today.
[01:37:59.000 --> 01:38:05.000]   You think it's better if you go to a church where you don't feel guilty.
[01:38:05.000 --> 01:38:08.000]   I'm just going to go when I feel like it, and I'm not going to go when I don't feel like it.
[01:38:08.000 --> 01:38:11.000]   You think allowing your flesh to dictate what you're committed to,
[01:38:11.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   what you prioritize, is actually a good thing.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:14.000]   It is not a good thing.
[01:38:14.000 --> 01:38:17.000]   Paul says, "I buff in my body and make it my slave.
[01:38:17.000 --> 01:38:20.000]   After I preach to others that I may be disqualified."
[01:38:20.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   So if we believe that the Word of God has high priority,
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:28.000]   the discipline to get the Word of God in us and us into the Bible should be high priority.
[01:38:28.000 --> 01:38:29.000]   Shouldn't it?
[01:38:29.000 --> 01:38:31.000]   And so that's all we're saying.
[01:38:31.000 --> 01:38:32.000]   That's all we're saying.
[01:38:32.000 --> 01:38:35.000]   We're asking you to take this covenant seriously
[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:40.000]   because the Bible has placed this as high priority in every Christian's life.
[01:38:40.000 --> 01:38:42.000]   How much of your current knowledge of the Bible
[01:38:42.000 --> 01:38:44.000]   do you think you've attained through someone teaching you
[01:38:44.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   versus you searching the Word of God for yourself?
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:50.000]   This is not to make you feel guilty.
[01:38:50.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   It's just to examine where you are
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:58.000]   and make your personal intake of the Word of God a goal in your life.
[01:38:58.000 --> 01:39:00.000]   So we would have less and less of this.
[01:39:00.000 --> 01:39:01.000]   If the Bible is outlawed in the United States,
[01:39:01.000 --> 01:39:05.000]   how much of the Bible do you think you will be able to retain from memory
[01:39:05.000 --> 01:39:09.000]   even if it is not word for word?
[01:39:09.000 --> 01:39:12.000]   How much of the Bible do you think you have a grasp of
[01:39:12.000 --> 01:39:14.000]   that even if you are not able to jot it down word for word,
[01:39:14.000 --> 01:39:16.000]   that you'll be able to retain that?
[01:39:16.000 --> 01:39:18.000]   Or if the Bible is outlawed,
[01:39:18.000 --> 01:39:23.000]   how many years would it take before the Word of God is completely eliminated
[01:39:23.000 --> 01:39:28.000]   in your personal life if you didn't have other people around you?
[01:39:28.000 --> 01:39:29.000]   And then finally, application.
[01:39:29.000 --> 01:39:31.000]   What is the passage of the Bible that you've recently studied
[01:39:31.000 --> 01:39:34.000]   caused you to think differently about God and yourself
[01:39:34.000 --> 01:39:38.000]   and what applications were made in practice as a result of that?
[01:39:38.000 --> 01:39:45.000]   Let me pray for us and then we'll finish.
[01:39:45.000 --> 01:39:49.000]   Father, we thank you for your living Word.
[01:39:49.000 --> 01:39:53.000]   I pray that as a church
[01:39:53.000 --> 01:39:55.000]   that you would help us to build a church, Lord God,
[01:39:55.000 --> 01:39:59.000]   purposefully according to your commands,
[01:39:59.000 --> 01:40:01.000]   according to your Word.
[01:40:01.000 --> 01:40:04.000]   Help us simply not to be a hearer,
[01:40:04.000 --> 01:40:06.000]   not to depend on others, Lord God,
[01:40:06.000 --> 01:40:08.000]   not to study and to feed us.
[01:40:08.000 --> 01:40:11.000]   Help us to learn, Father, to handle your Word of God,
[01:40:11.000 --> 01:40:14.000]   that not only that we would seek you through it,
[01:40:14.000 --> 01:40:17.000]   that we would learn, Father God, to live holy lives,
[01:40:17.000 --> 01:40:20.000]   that we would ultimately be able to teach others
[01:40:20.000 --> 01:40:24.000]   and learn to delight in it day and night and meditate on it.
[01:40:24.000 --> 01:40:26.000]   So we pray for that end,
[01:40:26.000 --> 01:40:29.000]   that whether we are this number,
[01:40:29.000 --> 01:40:32.000]   whether we grow or whether we even decrease,
[01:40:32.000 --> 01:40:34.000]   help us, Lord God,
[01:40:34.000 --> 01:40:38.000]   to take seriously where the Word of God stands with us
[01:40:38.000 --> 01:40:41.000]   and that we would be the light that you called us to be.
[01:40:41.000 --> 01:40:44.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
