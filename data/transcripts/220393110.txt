[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.740]   Let me pray first and we'll jump right in.
[00:00:08.740 --> 00:00:22.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the privilege that we have to come in search of word.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:28.140]   We pray that as we jump into the study of Revelation that you would give us insight,
[00:00:28.140 --> 00:00:33.000]   the things that are easier to understand, help us Lord God to be eager to learn and
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   apply.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:38.620]   The things that are a bit more difficult, help us to be patient and do the homework
[00:00:38.620 --> 00:00:40.460]   that we need to do.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:46.040]   And even in our confusion, Father God, I pray that you would sanctify our hearts.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.360]   Help us to know who you are.
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:50.300]   Help us know the Bible better as we search your word.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:51.840]   And so we pray for your grace.
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:53.560]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:53.560 --> 00:00:54.560]   Amen.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:01:00.640]   All right, so before we get started, again, we're starting off, up to this point it's
[00:01:00.640 --> 00:01:03.080]   been pretty straightforward, right?
[00:01:03.080 --> 00:01:09.560]   You know, the only maybe discussion that we may have had is, are the Book of Revelation,
[00:01:09.560 --> 00:01:14.280]   the seven different churches of the Book of Revelation in the first two chapters, three
[00:01:14.280 --> 00:01:16.240]   chapters, you know, like how does it apply?
[00:01:16.240 --> 00:01:18.800]   Is it chronological?
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:20.120]   Is it talking about certain periods?
[00:01:20.120 --> 00:01:23.080]   And obviously there's some questions there, but it's pretty straightforward.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.480]   Those are literal churches that existed historically or some backgrounds, or he's talking to a
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:32.760]   something that we know tangibly existed.
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:36.840]   What we're looking at starting from chapter four is going to open up a can of worms.
[00:01:36.840 --> 00:01:40.680]   And so when we think about Book of Revelation, we're usually thinking about chapter four
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:42.280]   and on.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:44.840]   All the different visions that are come up, like where does it apply?
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:46.120]   What is it for?
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.160]   And so before we get into it, just as an encouragement, I found that, you know, studying through the
[00:01:54.160 --> 00:01:59.560]   Bible, obviously there are certain books that are much harder to understand than other books.
[00:01:59.560 --> 00:02:05.440]   Leviticus is one of those books, Numbers, Ezekiel, Lamentations, some parts of Daniel
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:06.440]   and Book of Revelation.
[00:02:06.440 --> 00:02:12.240]   But I found that some of the most rewarding studies are always in these books and not
[00:02:12.240 --> 00:02:18.240]   simply because you find some new things that you didn't know before, but it'll force you
[00:02:18.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   to try to connect the dots.
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:24.800]   It'll force you to look at other passages that are difficult places.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:30.920]   And so it will help you to understand how these things are connected to each other.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.120]   So oftentimes you can study the Book of Ephesians and never study any other book but Ephesians.
[00:02:36.120 --> 00:02:41.480]   So of course you can gain a lot from that, but these prophetic books, it really wasn't
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:44.120]   ever meant to be studied in isolation.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:46.520]   You have to study parts of Ezekiel.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.960]   You have to study parts of Daniel, parts of Isaiah.
[00:02:49.960 --> 00:02:55.200]   And so it helps us to connect the dots so that we can get a broader understanding of
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:57.160]   what God is doing.
[00:02:57.160 --> 00:03:05.160]   So we know that God's salvation history, that it's preparation for Christ and then the rest
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:11.080]   of human history from New Testament, the Gospels and on, it kind of points us back to Christ.
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.800]   But the specifics of how it's going to be revealed, the specifics of how all of these
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:23.520]   things are going to unravel, in particular in history, this is where these prophetic
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:25.840]   books, apocalyptic books come in.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:32.600]   And it kind of makes things that were kind of, again, it's not crystal clear, but it
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:38.400]   kind of gives you a much clearer picture of the application of how this is going to happen.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:42.480]   So it forces us to see the Bible in a completely different light that we may not normally look
[00:03:42.480 --> 00:03:43.480]   at.
[00:03:43.480 --> 00:03:47.320]   So the benefit of studying something like a book like this, where even if you don't
[00:03:47.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   come out saying like, "Oh, I'm still confused," the benefit of it is you'll understand the
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:55.560]   Bible a lot better than if you haven't done the homework.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:56.560]   Okay?
[00:03:56.560 --> 00:03:58.600]   All right, so we're looking at chapter four.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:04.280]   And chapter four actually is a new section that's going to open up and prepare us for
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:06.260]   what's coming in chapter six.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:12.360]   Chapter six and on, there are a series of seven different judgments that are coming.
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:19.560]   There's the trumpet, the seal judgment, and there's the bowl judgment, and then what did
[00:04:19.560 --> 00:04:20.560]   I miss?
[00:04:20.560 --> 00:04:23.960]   Okay, I'll get to that in a minute.
[00:04:23.960 --> 00:04:28.880]   But there's a series of seven different, three sets of seven judgments that are coming.
[00:04:28.880 --> 00:04:34.000]   And so what we're going to be looking at in chapter four and five is preparation for those
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:35.720]   judgments that's going to come.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:39.840]   And that's where all the stuff of the white horse and black horse and authority of the
[00:04:39.840 --> 00:04:43.320]   heavens being wiped away, that's that section.
[00:04:43.320 --> 00:04:50.720]   That section between chapter six and 16 is where the heavy prophecies are going to come
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:51.920]   and say, "Oh, I don't understand this."
[00:04:51.920 --> 00:04:55.320]   But we're going to hopefully get into that and dig into that a little bit further.
[00:04:55.320 --> 00:05:01.720]   But chapter four is the beginning of that.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:17.040]   All right, so chapter four and five, they record seven different scenes just in these
[00:05:17.040 --> 00:05:18.040]   two chapters.
[00:05:18.040 --> 00:05:21.960]   And when I say seven different scenes, just kind of imagine if you were trying to do a
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:29.320]   skit of these two chapters, you have to have seven different things that you have to present.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:32.120]   And so chapter four will present two of them.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:36.720]   And in chapter five, we will see five separate scenes, separate things that he sees.
[00:05:36.720 --> 00:05:38.800]   So we're going to break it up into these seven scenes.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.920]   Today we're going to be dealing with two of them.
[00:05:41.920 --> 00:05:44.880]   The seven of them, we don't have to go through all of them, but today we're going to be going
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.360]   through the open door to heaven that John is given a glimpse of.
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:54.360]   And these are all things that it says that it must happen before the other judgments
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:55.360]   come.
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:06:00.400]   And then we're going to see the vision of the throne of God and the description of that.
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:04.240]   And then the seal scrolls, and then the worthy lamb.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.080]   So we'll get to that when we get to chapter five.
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:10.560]   But today we're going to be dealing with one and two.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   The previous section that we looked at, chapter one, two, and three, it mainly dealt with
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.360]   what was happening on earth.
[00:06:18.360 --> 00:06:24.560]   Today's section and then the section on, it's the door to heaven is opened up and John is
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.200]   given a glimpse to reveal what's happening in heaven.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:34.920]   So completely flipped where we've been studying what God was seeing on earth, and now we're
[00:06:34.920 --> 00:06:39.440]   going to be studying what John is seeing up in heaven.
[00:06:39.440 --> 00:06:43.880]   And so chapter four and on is what God is revealing to John.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.600]   And so it's not something specifically happening on earth.
[00:06:47.600 --> 00:06:50.920]   These are things that are going to play out, and then ultimately it's going to play out
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:56.040]   in the future.
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:03.440]   So beginning section one, where the vision of the open door, and it opens by saying that
[00:07:03.440 --> 00:07:10.240]   the same voice of the trumpet that led or spoke to John in chapter one is the same voice
[00:07:10.240 --> 00:07:11.240]   that's going to be leading him.
[00:07:11.240 --> 00:07:16.480]   So obviously it's talking about Christ, and some people ask the question is if he's talking
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:18.760]   about first voice, is the second voice different?
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:23.360]   And I believe it's for the purpose of emphasis that it is the same person, meaning clearly
[00:07:23.360 --> 00:07:24.480]   chapter one is Jesus.
[00:07:24.480 --> 00:07:30.280]   So chapter four and on is also Jesus kind of playing the tour guide to John, revealing
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:41.800]   to him that this is what's happening and he's speaking to him.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:48.760]   The same vision, if you can turn your Bibles to Ezekiel chapter one, I want to encourage
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:51.520]   you as you guys are studying through some of these prophecies, we're going to be jumping
[00:07:51.520 --> 00:07:55.560]   back and forth to Ezekiel and sometimes the book of Daniel, but I want you to see for
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:07:59.800]   yourself what is happening in the book of Ezekiel.
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:06.540]   Because the same vision, it's not identical, but it seems like what Ezekiel was seeing
[00:08:06.540 --> 00:08:10.360]   up in the throne of God is very similar.
[00:08:10.360 --> 00:08:18.000]   Not same, there's certain parts of the visions that are a bit different.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.760]   But there's no way that if you read Ezekiel chapter one and you read Revelation chapter
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:25.720]   four that you're not going to be able to see the similarities between these two things.
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.960]   And it seems like that it's pointing to the same thing.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:34.280]   So I'm going to read a portion of this just for point of reference, and then as we continue
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:37.920]   to study we're going to be jumping back and forth to the book of Ezekiel just to kind
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:40.520]   of show the parallel between these two visions.
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:45.200]   Starting from verse four, it says, "As I looked, behold, a stormy wind came out of
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:49.800]   the north and great cloud with brightness around it and fire flashing forth continually
[00:08:49.800 --> 00:08:53.100]   and in the midst of the fire as it was gleaming metal.
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:57.000]   And from the midst of it came likeness of four living creatures."
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.160]   Probably if you read Revelation before you came, you already know that four living creatures
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:03.960]   are mentioned in the book of Revelation chapter four.
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.800]   And this was the appearance they had of human likeness, but each had four faces and each
[00:09:08.800 --> 00:09:10.920]   of them had four wings.
[00:09:10.920 --> 00:09:17.840]   Now the description of the faces are the same, but description of each of the creatures,
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.160]   if you haven't noticed, I'll point out later, it is different.
[00:09:22.160 --> 00:09:26.360]   And I actually have a picture of this so it can kind of give you a visual.
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:29.960]   Their legs were straight and the soles of their feet were like the sole of the calf's
[00:09:29.960 --> 00:09:34.920]   foot and they sparkled like burnished bronze under their wings of their four sides.
[00:09:34.920 --> 00:09:39.160]   They had human hands and their four had the faces of their wings thus and it goes on and
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:40.160]   on and on.
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.680]   So there's no way that you can read chapter four and read Ezekiel chapter one and not
[00:09:43.680 --> 00:09:45.840]   see the parallel between these two.
[00:09:45.840 --> 00:09:50.120]   In fact, Daniel has bits and pieces of this as well, but it's not as extensive as it is
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:52.000]   in Ezekiel chapter one.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.360]   So clearly what John is seeing, maybe he has a different angle or maybe he's seeing a different
[00:09:57.360 --> 00:10:03.960]   portion of the throne of God, but it seems like John and Ezekiel is seeing the same throne
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:11.080]   because we can clearly see the similarities.
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:14.900]   And the voice that is speaking to John here is also mentioned that it was like a voice
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:19.220]   of trumpet and we mentioned that the first time that this came out, that the trumpet
[00:10:19.220 --> 00:10:24.960]   is used for the purpose of gaining attention typically in times of war or to gather the
[00:10:24.960 --> 00:10:29.280]   people or have a sense of urgency to or to announce something very important.
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:33.600]   So when John hears the voice like a trumpet, it is not a soft whisper.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:38.600]   It is not something that Jesus is speaking in a gentle voice.
[00:10:38.600 --> 00:10:46.600]   He's saying, "Thus saith the Lord," he's coming with authority and with a sense of urgency.
[00:10:46.600 --> 00:10:55.920]   So the scene two of the throne of God, I chose the picture that in my mind depicted as accurately
[00:10:55.920 --> 00:10:56.920]   as I saw.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:00.580]   Obviously it's not as detailed and you probably can't see it, but I could have chosen other
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:06.440]   pictures that were more, I don't know, maybe clearer to see, but I think this one captures
[00:11:06.440 --> 00:11:08.560]   the closest to all the details.
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:13.360]   See how all the elders, 24 elders are bowing down in worship.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.240]   You see the creatures there.
[00:11:15.240 --> 00:11:16.720]   Can you see them here?
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:19.080]   Can you see them?
[00:11:19.080 --> 00:11:20.080]   Kind of.
[00:11:20.080 --> 00:11:21.480]   Anyway, I'll show you more details later.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:27.640]   So we don't know exactly if this is exactly what John saw, but according to the description,
[00:11:27.640 --> 00:11:32.880]   there's actually quite a few artists who try to depict this and I'm imagining when I'm
[00:11:32.880 --> 00:11:37.240]   reading it, this is the scene that I see, right?
[00:11:37.240 --> 00:11:40.320]   So just soak this in so you get an impression in your head.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.960]   So as we're talking about it, you have a visual in your head.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:49.840]   So if you're a visual learner, hopefully this will help.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:55.080]   So scene two, where we begin starting from verse two through 11.
[00:11:55.080 --> 00:11:59.680]   So scene one is the calling, "Hey, John come and look at the open door and we're going
[00:11:59.680 --> 00:12:04.960]   to give you a glimpse into heaven to show you what must take place before the seal judgments
[00:12:04.960 --> 00:12:06.840]   come, the other judgments come."
[00:12:06.840 --> 00:12:12.520]   And so in scene two, John is looking in and scene one, he sees the door.
[00:12:12.520 --> 00:12:17.320]   Scene two, he's looking in, he's seeing the throne of God.
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:22.200]   So John, it says, is taken in the spirit because he is now taken into the heavenly realm rather
[00:12:22.200 --> 00:12:24.120]   than God coming down to the earthly realm.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:30.520]   Now, the reason why I jotted this down is because we discussed that John, when he heard
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:35.440]   from Christ about what was happening, he was in the spirit.
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:41.880]   Again, this is just a thought that I had that possibly the reason why John was taken up
[00:12:41.880 --> 00:12:48.320]   in the spirit was because Jesus was bringing him to a spiritual realm to show something
[00:12:48.320 --> 00:12:50.320]   that is not physical.
[00:12:50.320 --> 00:12:55.400]   Where Jesus came and took on human form to communicate with us at our level, but when
[00:12:55.400 --> 00:12:59.320]   these prophetic things are going on, John is taken up to the heavenly level, so that's
[00:12:59.320 --> 00:13:05.400]   why he's in the spirit, right?
[00:13:05.400 --> 00:13:15.080]   So he gets a glimpse into heaven, but typically when we think of the image of heaven, when
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:22.280]   we think of the image of heaven, how many of you think of just open grass?
[00:13:22.280 --> 00:13:27.880]   Some of you guys are nodding, right?
[00:13:27.880 --> 00:13:30.880]   Clouds maybe, right?
[00:13:30.880 --> 00:13:31.880]   Mansions maybe?
[00:13:31.880 --> 00:13:34.640]   You might have heard maybe mansions?
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:41.080]   Every scene that we see where they get a glimpse of heaven, they see the throne, right?
[00:13:41.080 --> 00:13:46.400]   The vision that we're seeing here is not unique to John.
[00:13:46.400 --> 00:13:51.240]   Isaiah sees a vision when he sees heaven, he sees a vision of God on his throne.
[00:13:51.240 --> 00:13:52.480]   Ezekiel sees it.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.000]   Daniel sees it.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.920]   So it's mentioned in the book of Matthew.
[00:13:57.920 --> 00:14:00.020]   It's mentioned in the book of Kings.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:07.280]   So when heavens are opened up and the kingdom of heaven is shown or demonstrated, in almost
[00:14:07.280 --> 00:14:14.600]   every scene, the scene that they see is God on his throne and the angels in worship.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:18.420]   Now I don't know if we get to heaven, if that's the first thing we're going to see.
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:20.720]   My guess is probably, right?
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:21.720]   My guess is probably.
[00:14:21.720 --> 00:14:25.200]   Now I say, well, you got billions of people, you know, we're going to be so far, we're
[00:14:25.200 --> 00:14:26.520]   not going to see it.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:33.340]   You know, you may argue all of that, but I think there's a reason why every time the
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:39.580]   curtain to God's kingdom is open, that the first thing and the most primary thing that
[00:14:39.580 --> 00:14:41.380]   they see is God himself.
[00:14:41.380 --> 00:14:46.580]   And you probably heard that term, if, you know, if Christ was not, if Jesus was not
[00:14:46.580 --> 00:14:49.700]   in heaven, heaven wouldn't be heaven, right?
[00:14:49.700 --> 00:14:51.980]   Heaven is heaven is because that's his dwelling place.
[00:14:51.980 --> 00:14:53.220]   That's his kingdom.
[00:14:53.220 --> 00:14:54.860]   He's bringing us to his house.
[00:14:54.860 --> 00:14:58.360]   So it would only make sense that if you're going over to somebody's house, the first
[00:14:58.360 --> 00:15:03.300]   thing that you're going to see in that house is that somebody that you came to see, right?
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:09.820]   And that's why I really feel like, you know, Jonathan Edwards describes perfectly, you
[00:15:09.820 --> 00:15:15.060]   know, what is the greatest evidence of true salvation is that there is an affection for
[00:15:15.060 --> 00:15:19.220]   Christ that wasn't there before, right?
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:23.960]   Because it's the affection for Christ, which is what causes you to repent, to draw near
[00:15:23.960 --> 00:15:28.380]   to him, desire to be sanctified, come to church, serve one another, and long for his second
[00:15:28.380 --> 00:15:29.740]   coming.
[00:15:29.740 --> 00:15:32.580]   So Jonathan Edwards says we can fake passion for Christ.
[00:15:32.580 --> 00:15:33.580]   We can fake prayer.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:34.940]   We can break missions.
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:37.880]   We can fake fellowship and sacrifice.
[00:15:37.880 --> 00:15:39.680]   But in the end, all of that stuff can be fake.
[00:15:39.680 --> 00:15:45.060]   But at the core of genuine salvation, there's always affection for Christ, right?
[00:15:45.060 --> 00:15:52.220]   So it's interesting that, again, that when John is shown heaven, first thing that he
[00:15:52.220 --> 00:15:58.300]   sees is the same picture that all the other prophets sees is God's throne and all the
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:03.060]   creatures that surround him is worshiping him day in and day out.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:08.060]   And most likely when we get to heaven, that's going to be our, what we're going to be doing,
[00:16:08.060 --> 00:16:09.060]   right?
[00:16:09.060 --> 00:16:13.940]   So if you don't find life in worshiping God, heaven is not a place that you're going to
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:16.700]   want to go, right?
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.620]   And those of you guys, I think, you know, most, all of you, if not most of you are going
[00:16:20.620 --> 00:16:22.780]   to understand exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:16:22.780 --> 00:16:27.180]   If you're a Christian, you're probably, your testimony is probably, you know, similar or
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:28.220]   same to mine.
[00:16:28.220 --> 00:16:35.920]   The greatest ecstasy that I've ever experienced was always in the context of real worship
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:37.140]   before God.
[00:16:37.140 --> 00:16:38.660]   That's when I feel the most alive.
[00:16:38.660 --> 00:16:43.420]   That's when I feel the greatest fellowship or meaning in life and purpose, where I feel
[00:16:43.420 --> 00:16:45.580]   the greatest joy, right?
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:51.380]   And so heaven is a place that's described where all the creatures are worshiping him
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:54.620]   24/7, right?
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:56.260]   So maybe there is green grass there.
[00:16:56.260 --> 00:17:00.260]   Maybe there are mentions there, but those are just props.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:06.440]   The main dish is going to be what he's seeing here, the throne of God.
[00:17:06.440 --> 00:17:11.300]   In fact, this theme is probably one of the main themes of the book of Revelation.
[00:17:11.300 --> 00:17:17.340]   The term throne of God is mentioned, I forgot how many, it's like 200 some times in the
[00:17:17.340 --> 00:17:22.660]   whole Bible, and it's mentioned 45 times in Revelations alone.
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:27.100]   So you can understand why in first and second Kings that the term throne of God would be
[00:17:27.100 --> 00:17:28.600]   mentioned, right?
[00:17:28.600 --> 00:17:30.780]   Or the term throne would be mentioned 32 times.
[00:17:30.780 --> 00:17:34.140]   So in the book of Revelation alone, it's 45 times.
[00:17:34.140 --> 00:17:43.180]   So in the book of New Testament, for every four times that the term throne of God is
[00:17:43.180 --> 00:17:48.740]   mentioned, two-thirds of it is found in the book of Revelation.
[00:17:48.740 --> 00:17:51.700]   Two-thirds of the mention of the throne of God is in the book of Revelation.
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:57.460]   So we can say in summary that one of the main themes of the book of Revelation is about
[00:17:57.460 --> 00:18:01.140]   God's exalted throne and worship.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:04.260]   So if somebody asks you, "What is Revelation about?"
[00:18:04.260 --> 00:18:08.380]   It's about God's throne and his worship.
[00:18:08.380 --> 00:18:13.900]   That all of history, all of history, all of salvation, everything that Christ has done,
[00:18:13.900 --> 00:18:17.280]   ultimately it's going to culminate into this scene.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:22.860]   That what John is seeing, that at one point when he comes to redeem us, we see only in
[00:18:22.860 --> 00:18:28.340]   part, we're going to see him as he is, that it's going to ultimately lead to this scene.
[00:18:28.340 --> 00:18:31.900]   We're going to be participant of this scene.
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:38.340]   And that's the culmination of human history.
[00:18:38.340 --> 00:18:44.540]   In fact, if you read through the book of Psalm, when God is mentioned repeatedly, over and
[00:18:44.540 --> 00:18:51.020]   over again, he's mentioned as the one who's sitting on his throne.
[00:18:51.020 --> 00:18:59.700]   Today we think of God, we think of him with his, what do you call it, with his tunic wrapped
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:03.380]   around his belt, on his knees, washing his disciples' feet.
[00:19:03.380 --> 00:19:07.500]   And that's typically the scene that we see of Christ, or him crucified on the cross is
[00:19:07.500 --> 00:19:08.820]   often the scene that we see.
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:14.340]   But when the Bible describes Christ over and over again, or God the Father, he's the one
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:18.220]   who is exalted, he's the king who is being worshipped.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:21.660]   And that's the same picture that we see also in the book of Revelation.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.900]   That the Christ that we worship, that everything that he has done has led to this.
[00:19:26.900 --> 00:19:32.740]   So like it says in Philippians chapter 2, he had the same equality with God, and then
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:36.260]   he humbled himself, and because he humbled himself, what did God do?
[00:19:36.260 --> 00:19:40.560]   He exalted him to the highest place, name above all names.
[00:19:40.560 --> 00:19:44.860]   That every knee should bow and every tongue confess that Christ is Lord.
[00:19:44.860 --> 00:19:48.540]   So that's the scene that we see in heaven, and that's the most common description that
[00:19:48.540 --> 00:19:57.740]   we see in the scriptures of our God.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.540]   The three stones that are mentioned in the throne, no one knows for sure.
[00:20:04.540 --> 00:20:09.500]   Every commentary that you read, it has some variation of it, so no one knows exactly for
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:21.420]   sure, but there are some who will guess and say that Jasper, at least in that time, represented
[00:20:21.420 --> 00:20:23.860]   holiness or purity.
[00:20:23.860 --> 00:20:24.860]   Carnelian represented wrath.
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:27.700]   I don't even know what a carnelian is.
[00:20:27.700 --> 00:20:28.700]   An emerald.
[00:20:28.700 --> 00:20:29.700]   What is it?
[00:20:29.700 --> 00:20:31.700]   You guys know what a carnelian is?
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.980]   A red stone.
[00:20:33.980 --> 00:20:34.980]   Okay.
[00:20:34.980 --> 00:20:36.940]   I've never even heard of this word.
[00:20:36.940 --> 00:20:38.260]   Yeah.
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:40.140]   Carnelian connected with the wrath of God.
[00:20:40.140 --> 00:20:42.220]   Again, that's just an educated guess.
[00:20:42.220 --> 00:20:46.180]   We don't know for sure.
[00:20:46.180 --> 00:20:51.020]   The rainbow that it describes, obviously the first thing that we think of is the promise
[00:20:51.020 --> 00:20:56.900]   that God makes to Noah and his descendants that he would not judge the world the same
[00:20:56.900 --> 00:20:59.380]   way that he judged them at that time.
[00:20:59.380 --> 00:21:04.660]   So in the midst of his majesty and thunder and all of this stuff, he says one of the
[00:21:04.660 --> 00:21:09.380]   things that they see is the rainbow, and rainbow is a reminder of the covenant that
[00:21:09.380 --> 00:21:18.580]   he makes, that he would be faithful and merciful to his people.
[00:21:18.580 --> 00:21:22.420]   We see a vision of the 24 elders.
[00:21:22.420 --> 00:21:29.380]   Again, there's a lot of debate as to who these 24 elders are, but most commentators are in
[00:21:29.380 --> 00:21:30.380]   agreement.
[00:21:30.380 --> 00:21:34.940]   Again, this is not a fact, but it's just an educated guess, that it symbolizes all
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:36.940]   of mankind.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:41.580]   That some think that maybe it was 12 angels and then 12 tribes of Israel put together
[00:21:41.580 --> 00:21:42.980]   as 24.
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:48.320]   Some people think that just the number 24 is symbolizing of totality of all mankind.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:53.180]   But in the end, the conclusion, however you come up with 24, the common conclusion is
[00:21:53.180 --> 00:21:57.940]   that these 24 elders basically represents all of creation.
[00:21:57.940 --> 00:22:05.020]   And their primary task, when they are mentioned over and over again, they're prostrated in
[00:22:05.020 --> 00:22:08.460]   worshiping God.
[00:22:08.460 --> 00:22:15.380]   So when John sees this vision of the throne of God, the scene that he sees are his creation
[00:22:15.380 --> 00:22:17.060]   bowing down in worship.
[00:22:17.060 --> 00:22:22.900]   And again, the word for worship, proskuneo, literally means to prostrate oneself.
[00:22:22.900 --> 00:22:27.620]   That this is not just casual, you know, raising of hands and singing some songs.
[00:22:27.620 --> 00:22:35.420]   This is where you're in the presence of this glory and you can't help but to fall down
[00:22:35.420 --> 00:22:36.420]   in honor.
[00:22:36.420 --> 00:22:38.460]   You're so floored by his glory.
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:44.020]   And that's the word that is commonly used in the Bible to describe worship, to be prostrated.
[00:22:44.020 --> 00:22:54.480]   And so these 24 elders are 24/7, is around the throne constantly giving worship to God.
[00:22:54.480 --> 00:22:58.420]   And adoration and praise, like what comes out of their mouth in those passages that
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:14.260]   I put up there, is constantly praising.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:21.180]   So let me take a minute here before we move on to the other side, and I'm going to reiterate.
[00:23:21.180 --> 00:23:27.800]   When you think about the picture of heaven, like what makes you want to go to heaven?
[00:23:27.800 --> 00:23:30.940]   What makes you long to go to heaven?
[00:23:30.940 --> 00:23:34.000]   What makes you long for Christ to come?
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:38.600]   Every once in a while somebody will say, kind of jokingly, but not really, like, "I don't
[00:23:38.600 --> 00:23:42.320]   want Jesus to come before I get married, because I want to experience marriage."
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:47.720]   You know, so, you know, like I'm longing for marriage first and then Jesus, right?
[00:23:47.720 --> 00:23:51.000]   And I know, you know, sometimes we're joking and sometimes we're not.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:58.040]   But what is it about heaven, not what you should be thinking about, not what I said
[00:23:58.040 --> 00:24:03.560]   or Bible study, but what do you long for?
[00:24:03.560 --> 00:24:07.840]   When I go to heaven, I really am looking forward to this.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:13.000]   And obviously, if you have loved ones that you lost, I mean, that's probably one of the
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.840]   first things that you're going to be thinking about.
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:24.120]   If you're suffering of any kind, probably thinking, like, "Hey, no more suffering,
[00:24:24.120 --> 00:24:27.640]   we go there, we don't have to be separated from loved ones, and, you know, there's no
[00:24:27.640 --> 00:24:30.040]   more suffering."
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:37.360]   This rat race that you and I have to live just to make ends meet, right?
[00:24:37.360 --> 00:24:38.440]   Relational problems that we have.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:41.120]   So all of these things the Bible promises.
[00:24:41.120 --> 00:24:46.480]   But the primary thing that the Scripture says the activity that you and I are going to be
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:52.320]   engaged in is eternal worship, because that's what God created us to do, to be His image
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:53.440]   bearers.
[00:24:53.440 --> 00:24:58.340]   So when sin came into the world, mankind dies.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:25:00.120]   So what was lost?
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:03.560]   Our ability to give Him glory, right?
[00:25:03.560 --> 00:25:07.460]   That's what it says in Romans chapter 3, 23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory
[00:25:07.460 --> 00:25:08.880]   of God."
[00:25:08.880 --> 00:25:16.920]   So when God restores us into eternal life, He's restoring us to be able to be His image
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:19.080]   bearers.
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:22.760]   Because you and I are still in this flesh, we do a poor job, right?
[00:25:22.760 --> 00:25:28.580]   We reflect, but part of sanctification is to reflect better, right, who He is.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.560]   So one day when we are finally delivered from this sinful flesh and we're in our glorified
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:40.160]   bodies, we're going to be in heaven reflecting His glory the way we were meant to.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.520]   Now why is this so important?
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:44.420]   As I mentioned before, right?
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:51.280]   If giving glory to God is not attractive while you live here, I don't think that gets turned
[00:25:51.280 --> 00:25:54.840]   on when you get to heaven.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:26:00.120]   I don't think at some point in your rapture between here and heaven, all of a sudden you
[00:26:00.120 --> 00:26:04.520]   gain this affection for Christ that you didn't have here.
[00:26:04.520 --> 00:26:08.480]   I think this affection that you had here is going to be intensified.
[00:26:08.480 --> 00:26:13.000]   I think the longing to be in His presence is going to be intensified.
[00:26:13.000 --> 00:26:18.800]   The ecstasy that you felt at any level of being in the presence of His glory is going
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:20.920]   to be intensified.
[00:26:20.920 --> 00:26:26.840]   So oftentimes we make a picture of heaven of, "Oh, it'd be great," kind of like, you
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:30.960]   know, if you visit a new place, right, that you've never seen, you've only seen pictures,
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:36.840]   "Oh, it'd be great if I visited Machu Picchu or if I visited or ate this," and you fantasize
[00:26:36.840 --> 00:26:39.360]   of what it would be like, right?
[00:26:39.360 --> 00:26:42.840]   And so you create this in His head and then you create this longing in your heart because
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:45.420]   you've imagined it in your head.
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:49.840]   But the thing that you've imagined in your head, is it the reality?
[00:26:49.840 --> 00:26:54.160]   The heaven that you've imagined in your head, is it what the Scripture says what heaven
[00:26:54.160 --> 00:26:57.040]   would be like, right?
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:02.120]   Because the primary and the central activity that the Scripture teaches us about heaven
[00:27:02.120 --> 00:27:04.680]   is to bring glory to God, is to worship God.
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:08.640]   What these creatures and what these elders are doing is what we're going to be doing.
[00:27:08.640 --> 00:27:10.840]   We're going to be joining them and it's going to be for eternity.
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:13.520]   It's not going to be Sunday morning for two hours, right?
[00:27:13.520 --> 00:27:15.460]   It's going to be for eternity.
[00:27:15.460 --> 00:27:21.440]   So a Christian is somebody who has seen and has gotten a glimpse of the glory of the gospel
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:26.000]   of Jesus Christ and you are longing for more of it, right?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.980]   In essence, that's what salvation is.
[00:27:28.980 --> 00:27:36.440]   Salvation is having our eyes open to see something beautiful and wanting more of it, right?
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:39.160]   So think about all the application of that.
[00:27:39.160 --> 00:27:43.720]   If that's our end goal, if the end goal of human history, if the end goal of Christ's
[00:27:43.720 --> 00:27:48.320]   suffering, if the end goal of persecution and all of that is to lead us to that scene,
[00:27:48.320 --> 00:27:55.120]   what John is seeing in heaven, what good is it to bring people to church, to fall in love
[00:27:55.120 --> 00:27:59.840]   with church, with people, with all these different activities, if ultimately we're not bringing
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.920]   them to this, right?
[00:28:02.920 --> 00:28:07.400]   So the primary thing of the church is to bring them to love Christ because this is where
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:08.880]   we're taking them.
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:14.800]   We can't promise them to take them somewhere else and then sign a bait and switch later,
[00:28:14.800 --> 00:28:15.880]   right?
[00:28:15.880 --> 00:28:20.480]   So this scene that we're studying is not just a vision of some prophetic something
[00:28:20.480 --> 00:28:21.480]   in the future.
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.560]   This is where we're headed.
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.600]   So hopefully as we're studying at least the next, you know, chapter four and chapter five,
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:32.240]   that you're getting a glimpse of your future home, right?
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:34.000]   You're getting a glimpse of your future home.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:39.040]   So I hope that you can study with that kind of curiosity to really ask, what does this
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.040]   mean?
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:46.920]   And I'll let you know when I actually get up there, okay?
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:55.520]   It says that he sees and hears a thunder and lightning around the throne.
[00:28:55.520 --> 00:29:01.320]   Each time the thunder and lightning is mentioned in chapter eight, 11, and 16, it is at the
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.280]   conclusion at the seven judgments that are coming, right?
[00:29:06.280 --> 00:29:10.880]   It's almost kind of like a crescendo at the end where, you know, you kind of hear the
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:12.540]   percussion.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.940]   And then when it comes to then it kind of builds up and then it ends with a boom.
[00:29:16.940 --> 00:29:18.800]   And so it starts with this boom.
[00:29:18.800 --> 00:29:22.640]   He sees the heaven and that's what he sees and hears.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.840]   Basically it represents God's majesty and that's what we see, right?
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:29.520]   And that's what Moses saw in Exodus chapter 19, 16.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:31.060]   He saw the same vision.
[00:29:31.060 --> 00:29:34.460]   When God draws near to him, he heard thunder and lightning.
[00:29:34.460 --> 00:29:39.380]   And so in every instance where thunder and lightning is mentioned, it's at the end conclusion
[00:29:39.380 --> 00:29:45.600]   of these judgments that are coming upon the earth and it concludes with God's mighty presence,
[00:29:45.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   right?
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:54.260]   So it's kind of like an exclamation mark and that's what John is seeing up in heaven.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:56.840]   Sea of Glass, he mentions.
[00:29:56.840 --> 00:30:04.220]   Again, we don't know exactly what it is, but it is mentioned again in Ezekiel chapter 122
[00:30:04.220 --> 00:30:07.020]   and basically it says, "Over the heads of the living creatures there was a likeness
[00:30:07.020 --> 00:30:12.800]   of an expanse shining like all inspiring crystals spread out above their heads."
[00:30:12.800 --> 00:30:18.960]   So in this passage, we don't have any specific descriptions, but in Ezekiel, it kind of describes
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:25.160]   this ocean or Sea of Glass as an expanse between God and the person who's seeing God.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.540]   So there is a divide, right?
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:30.280]   At least that's the way it's being described.
[00:30:30.280 --> 00:30:33.760]   So possibly that's what John is seeing, right?
[00:30:33.760 --> 00:30:39.120]   That God's glory, that's as closest that we'll ever get, but there's still a distinction
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.720]   between God and his creation.
[00:30:44.720 --> 00:30:49.980]   There's so many better pictures than this, but the reason why I chose this is because
[00:30:49.980 --> 00:30:51.520]   it captured all the details.
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:54.640]   I mean, I hope you can see it.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:58.360]   And if you see the details, it's pretty ugly.
[00:30:58.360 --> 00:30:59.840]   These are all eyes.
[00:30:59.840 --> 00:31:02.120]   Yeah, it's ugly.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.600]   But you read Revelations, that's what it says, right?
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:13.120]   And if you look at it, here's the head of a lion, ox, human being, and an eagle.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:16.680]   And in this picture, they have six wings, right?
[00:31:16.680 --> 00:31:17.680]   They have six wings.
[00:31:17.680 --> 00:31:22.720]   I don't know if you can see all of them, but each of them independently have six wings,
[00:31:22.720 --> 00:31:23.880]   right?
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:29.600]   Now there's a description similar to this in Ezekiel, right?
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.120]   Probably when we're reading through it, you're paying attention, but the distinction is,
[00:31:34.120 --> 00:31:39.680]   if you look at the vision in Ezekiel, it says it has four creatures and they have four wings,
[00:31:39.680 --> 00:31:45.720]   and each of them, each one of them have, you know, the Revelation has, each one has, one
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:50.960]   has a head of a human being, one has a head of an ox, one has a head of an eagle, and
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:52.080]   what did I miss, a lion.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:55.360]   Here, every single creature has all of them.
[00:31:55.360 --> 00:32:00.160]   So in one creature, it has all four heads, okay?
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:06.100]   So again, you know, we can look at that and say, well, it's similar but not the same.
[00:32:06.100 --> 00:32:11.560]   So obviously, these are not the same creatures, but the creature that does seem like that
[00:32:11.560 --> 00:32:16.360]   is most similar to what we're seeing in Revelation chapter 4 is seen in Isaiah chapter 6.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:21.520]   Again, Isaiah chapter 6 doesn't have a lot of details, but it does describe the creature
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:28.280]   and has six wings and it seems closer to chapter 4, okay?
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:34.080]   Alright, so just have a visual.
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.520]   So this is not it, it's this, okay?
[00:32:38.520 --> 00:32:42.960]   And if you want to clear a better picture, look at, go Google it.
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:47.020]   But again, the reason I chose this is because it has, I feel like it has all the details
[00:32:47.020 --> 00:32:53.040]   in place, you know, and some of them, they didn't draw the eyes right, some of them,
[00:32:53.040 --> 00:32:57.160]   you can't see the wings, some of them, like, you can see two but not the other two, but
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:01.780]   this one has all four of them and it has all the details, okay?
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.060]   This is the vision from Ezekiel.
[00:33:07.060 --> 00:33:11.260]   So the four living creatures are very prominent in the visions.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:16.900]   They will appear several times throughout the book of Revelation, right?
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:23.460]   And those are the passages that you'll see them in.
[00:33:23.460 --> 00:33:28.580]   And there are a lot of similarities between the vision in Ezekiel and some of the differences
[00:33:28.580 --> 00:33:34.580]   where, again, I just mentioned, Ezekiel's vision has four faces on each creature, they
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:40.020]   have four wings, and then if you keep reading, there's a lot of similarities and things that
[00:33:40.020 --> 00:33:41.020]   are not.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:48.620]   And those are just the most prominent things.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:34:05.900]   The vision is probably closer to the one in Isaiah, okay?
[00:34:05.900 --> 00:34:12.660]   So if you remember the vision in Isaiah, where Isaiah sees the throne of God and it says,
[00:34:12.660 --> 00:34:24.620]   "Above him stood the seraphim, each had six wings, with two he covered his face, and with
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:29.460]   two he covered his feet, and with two he flew, and one called to another and said, 'Holy,
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.660]   holy, holy is the Lord of hosts, the whole earth is full of his glory.'"
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:37.860]   He doesn't say the exact same thing, but that phrase, "Holy, holy, holy," is being cried
[00:34:37.860 --> 00:34:55.540]   out by the same creatures mentioned in Isaiah 6 as the ones that we are looking at today.
[00:34:55.540 --> 00:35:00.300]   Now one of the opinions of the food these four creatures are, again, there's a lot of
[00:35:00.300 --> 00:35:03.340]   guessing when it comes to these things.
[00:35:03.340 --> 00:35:12.780]   I just put Robert H. Mounds, he's the New International Commentary, and he basically
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:16.620]   says they are living creatures in an exalted order of angelic meaning, meaning that these
[00:35:16.620 --> 00:35:19.660]   creatures are the highest of the angels.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:25.380]   And that's why they are the closest to God's throne, and they serve as basically choir
[00:35:25.380 --> 00:35:26.380]   directors.
[00:35:26.380 --> 00:35:32.460]   But if you notice, that whenever they begin to worship and cry out, the other 24 elders
[00:35:32.460 --> 00:35:35.860]   bow down and they begin to worship.
[00:35:35.860 --> 00:35:40.460]   So they're the ones who initiate, they're basically the worship leaders, and they're
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:42.740]   the ones who are the closest to the throne.
[00:35:42.740 --> 00:35:46.420]   And everybody else is on the outside, they initiate and everybody follows.
[00:35:46.420 --> 00:35:53.780]   And so again, the guess is that they are the highest order of the angels, at least that's
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:57.740]   what they believe.
[00:35:57.740 --> 00:36:04.220]   They have eyes all over, and that's what makes the pictures almost kind of seem mythic.
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:08.340]   And whenever you talk about the eyes being everywhere, it's talking about alertness and
[00:36:08.340 --> 00:36:13.620]   knowledge, all seeing, that we don't know if they're omniscient, but they definitely
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:20.780]   are able to see all things.
[00:36:20.780 --> 00:36:26.740]   How many of you have heard or have been taught before that these four creatures represent
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:29.740]   the four gospels?
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:32.460]   Anybody?
[00:36:32.460 --> 00:36:36.440]   Nobody really?
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:39.540]   You can admit it, that's what I was taught.
[00:36:39.540 --> 00:36:45.860]   I took a book of revelation class in undergrad at Biola, and this was the view that was taught
[00:36:45.860 --> 00:36:49.580]   to me, that each of these creatures represent the four gospels.
[00:36:49.580 --> 00:36:54.580]   In fact, some of the commentaries will actually argue this.
[00:36:54.580 --> 00:36:56.060]   You've never heard that before?
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:37:00.940]   Well, you heard it for the first time.
[00:37:00.940 --> 00:37:05.320]   I don't think that's what it is, because I don't think there's enough evidence to point
[00:37:05.320 --> 00:37:14.540]   to that, but can you see why they would say that these four things point to the four gospels?
[00:37:14.540 --> 00:37:15.900]   Think.
[00:37:15.900 --> 00:37:21.460]   You got the man, you got the lion, you have the ox, and you have the eagle.
[00:37:21.460 --> 00:37:28.460]   Think about the four gospels, the emphasis and the unique characteristics of each of
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:30.240]   the gospels.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:37.100]   What is the book of Matthew's theme?
[00:37:37.100 --> 00:37:40.240]   Kingdom of God, Jesus Christ as King.
[00:37:40.240 --> 00:37:42.700]   So which animal would represent that?
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:45.020]   The lion, right?
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:48.180]   The lion, the lion of Judah, right?
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:52.900]   So the lion is often depicted as the king.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.020]   What is Mark?
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:38:02.660]   Do you remember when Pastor Alex taught this?
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.700]   He called it a gospel, this gospel, goal gospel.
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:09.480]   Good, good student.
[00:38:09.480 --> 00:38:14.460]   He called it the goal gospel because it has the record of the most miracles of Jesus.
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.460]   He's constantly, miracle after miracle, he's doing things.
[00:38:17.460 --> 00:38:21.500]   So it records the most action, right?
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.820]   Most events in the book of Matthew.
[00:38:23.820 --> 00:38:25.420]   So it's called the goal gospel.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:28.140]   So which one would represent that?
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.500]   The ox, right?
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:31.300]   The work, right?
[00:38:31.300 --> 00:38:33.760]   It carries the heavy load, or the work.
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:41.540]   And so the book of Luke, what is emphasized in the book of Luke?
[00:38:41.540 --> 00:38:49.020]   Humanity, right?
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:55.620]   It has the most detailed record of Christ's childhood when he's suffering on the cross.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:03.140]   There's a greatest description of his suffering and the spear coming into his side and blood
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:04.140]   and water gushing out.
[00:39:04.140 --> 00:39:09.220]   So it has, again, it's written by a doctor and so it has the most descriptions about
[00:39:09.220 --> 00:39:10.380]   his humanity.
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:15.860]   So Luke's gospel is known for emphasis on his humanity, right?
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:21.460]   And then the book of John emphasizes what?
[00:39:21.460 --> 00:39:25.820]   His deity, right?
[00:39:25.820 --> 00:39:27.500]   So again, we're not milking this.
[00:39:27.500 --> 00:39:30.260]   Each one of those gospels do represent these things.
[00:39:30.260 --> 00:39:33.420]   So you can see why some of the people were trying to translate this.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:35.380]   It represents the four gospel.
[00:39:35.380 --> 00:39:41.300]   So you could see the connection between it, but other than what I just said, there's no
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.860]   other evidence of that, right?
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.340]   But it sounds interesting.
[00:39:47.340 --> 00:39:50.020]   It sounds interesting.
[00:39:50.020 --> 00:39:56.460]   But at the least, we know that these are choir directors and they seem to be higher above
[00:39:56.460 --> 00:40:00.700]   other angels because they are at their nearest at the throne of God.
[00:40:00.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   And we see that here.
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:05.420]   We see that also in Ezekiel.
[00:40:05.420 --> 00:40:14.300]   And then we also see that in the book of Isaiah.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:19.620]   Probably the best way to understand these four creatures is that each one of them represents
[00:40:19.620 --> 00:40:24.220]   the top or the best in each field, where man being the caretaker of creation, lion being
[00:40:24.220 --> 00:40:28.900]   the king of the wild, ox being the strongest of the domesticated animals, eagles as the
[00:40:28.900 --> 00:40:30.240]   most majestic of the birds.
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:34.580]   So of all the creation, it is the most exalted, right?
[00:40:34.580 --> 00:40:39.140]   And that's probably, and if you go beyond that, maybe you can connect it to the gospel,
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:44.420]   but I think that in and of itself, like what do these animals, each one of them, collectively,
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:45.420]   what do they mean?
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.780]   It's the most precious, exalted.
[00:40:48.780 --> 00:40:53.220]   So it's kind of like saying that God is, you know, king of kings and lord of lords.
[00:40:53.220 --> 00:41:00.800]   And each of these creatures represent the top of the food chain, in essence.
[00:41:00.800 --> 00:41:03.460]   Each of them have six wings.
[00:41:03.460 --> 00:41:07.120]   And again, it may signify the swiftness to carry out the will of God.
[00:41:07.120 --> 00:41:09.780]   Again, that's mentioned in Psalm 1810.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:19.840]   He rode on a cherub and flew, he came swiftly on the wings of the wind.
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:24.220]   You understand why, like as I mentioned in the beginning, when you're studying apocalyptic
[00:41:24.220 --> 00:41:29.220]   writings, it forces you to try to find meaning in other places, like how did God use the
[00:41:29.220 --> 00:41:34.180]   term wing or, you know, different eyes and these animals.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:38.540]   And so it forces you to kind of look at certain thematic things that are mentioned in the
[00:41:38.540 --> 00:41:42.380]   Bible that you may not have really thought about before, but when you see it repeated
[00:41:42.380 --> 00:41:47.540]   over and over again, you kind of say, oh, there is a connection, right?
[00:41:47.540 --> 00:41:51.080]   The number three, typically you won't think much about it, right?
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   When you're just saying, oh, he was resurrected on the third day, were two or three witnesses,
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:56.080]   the inner circle of three, the Trinity.
[00:41:56.080 --> 00:41:59.600]   And over and over again, you see the number three, when you study it in isolation, you
[00:41:59.600 --> 00:42:01.000]   don't really think much about it.
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:05.960]   But when you think of it in the connection to the whole Bible, there's a clear theme,
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.880]   the number three, the number of confirmation, or you see the number seven is repeated over
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:13.940]   and over again for a number of completion, right?
[00:42:13.940 --> 00:42:18.160]   So when we look at some of these things, when it talks about eyes, right, obviously it's
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:22.120]   talking about omniscience, to be able to see all things, wings, right?
[00:42:22.120 --> 00:42:30.080]   To be the ability to move back and forth, to be obedient as a messenger, right?
[00:42:30.080 --> 00:42:38.120]   And finally, the creature's primary duty was to worship day and night, crying, "Holy,
[00:42:38.120 --> 00:42:39.480]   holy, holy."
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:41.600]   And that's the same scene that we see.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.220]   The language in the end part is slightly different than what we see in the book of Isaiah, but
[00:42:47.220 --> 00:42:54.160]   basically in essence, it's the same, those same three terms, "Holy, holy, holy," right?
[00:42:54.160 --> 00:42:58.180]   So before I conclude, I'm going to take a minute to think about that, right?
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:04.140]   So when we think of heaven, and this is the end conclusion of where God has taken us.
[00:43:04.140 --> 00:43:07.280]   When he comes to redeem his church and he says, "In my Father's house, there are many
[00:43:07.280 --> 00:43:13.360]   houses, and I go to prepare a place for you," that this is what he's preparing, right?
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:17.200]   He's preparing a place for us to join in this worship.
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:24.960]   And when John gets a glimpse of heaven, he opens the door for him to see what is happening
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:28.640]   in heaven and that this is happening in eternity.
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:32.200]   What he hears is, first he hears the thundering, right?
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:41.280]   He sees this picture of these precious stones, and he begins to hear the worship, and it's
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:46.560]   kind of in unison, going back and forth, where these creatures are circling around the throne,
[00:43:46.560 --> 00:43:48.200]   saying, "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:43:48.200 --> 00:43:53.500]   And every time they do that, the 24 elders in unison would take off their crown, right?
[00:43:53.500 --> 00:43:56.040]   Each one of the 12 also have their own throne.
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:44:00.800]   If you remember, when they respond in worship, they take off their crown, they get off their
[00:44:00.800 --> 00:44:04.320]   throne, they bow down, prostrate, and in worship.
[00:44:04.320 --> 00:44:07.600]   Part of the reason why they think that the 24 elders represent us is because the scripture
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:13.120]   tells us that we will also be co-heirs, we will be rulers with Christ, and we will have
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:16.160]   the crown of life and crown of glory given to us when we're there.
[00:44:16.160 --> 00:44:21.020]   And that's part of the reason why they think that the 24 elders represent us.
[00:44:21.020 --> 00:44:25.200]   But in worship, they take off their crown, they come off their throne, and they bow down,
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:26.600]   and they hear, "Holy, holy, holy."
[00:44:26.600 --> 00:44:33.000]   And this is repeated twice in the book of Isaiah and in the book of Revelation.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:36.720]   So whenever you see anything that's repeated more than once, you know it's for the purpose
[00:44:36.720 --> 00:44:38.360]   of emphasis.
[00:44:38.360 --> 00:44:43.060]   So when you hear, no other attribute of God is mentioned three times.
[00:44:43.060 --> 00:44:47.520]   But this attribute of holiness, not only is it mentioned three times, it's mentioned twice
[00:44:47.520 --> 00:44:49.180]   in two separate places.
[00:44:49.180 --> 00:44:54.440]   And when these two men of God sees the vision of the throne, the primary scene that they
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:45:03.240]   see is a holy, holy, holy God where people are prostrated in awe and in worship.
[00:45:03.240 --> 00:45:10.480]   So as human beings, as children of God who've been saved from an empty way of life, and
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:18.780]   now He desires us to be sanctified, the process of living, the process of us going from once
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:26.360]   being dead and now we are alive, and then we are coming to life, and then we will be
[00:45:26.360 --> 00:45:29.600]   alive finally when we're up in heaven, like ultimately.
[00:45:29.600 --> 00:45:36.840]   The process of sanctification is the process of living, the process of drawing closer to
[00:45:36.840 --> 00:45:37.840]   His glory.
[00:45:37.840 --> 00:45:42.680]   That's what sanctification ultimately is, is getting a greater and greater glimpse of
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:49.740]   His glory, which in turn causes us to be better worshipers.
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:51.680]   That's what Bible study is about.
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:53.580]   That's what fellowship is about.
[00:45:53.580 --> 00:45:55.000]   That's what church gathering is about.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.180]   All of it is ultimately to get a better glimpse of His glory.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:08.140]   So a Christian who is bored with His glory is going to be bored in heaven.
[00:46:08.140 --> 00:46:10.340]   He's going to be bored in Bible study.
[00:46:10.340 --> 00:46:13.540]   He's going to be bored in fellowship.
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.500]   Because all of it is meant to bring us to this.
[00:46:17.500 --> 00:46:28.420]   So I do you no service if I attract you or keep you coming by anything other than a greater
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.700]   glimpse of this.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:35.500]   Because the more you see of this, the more you desire of this, the more you will experience
[00:46:35.500 --> 00:46:41.860]   the life that Jesus promised, not something I can artificially give to you, to create,
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.340]   to make you feel good.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:47.540]   But in the end, true life is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:56.020]   So what I want to encourage our church this afternoon is think about this picture that
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:47:00.700]   has been vividly drawn for us in Revelation chapter 4.
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.740]   That this is not some strange picture of mythology.
[00:47:03.740 --> 00:47:08.380]   This is not, even though we don't know exactly, I mean, He's writing down for us what He
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:09.980]   visually saw.
[00:47:09.980 --> 00:47:11.980]   So it may be like this, it may be like this.
[00:47:11.980 --> 00:47:14.460]   We don't know if that's the exact picture that we're going to see.
[00:47:14.460 --> 00:47:20.980]   But the principles that we see from this vision is definitely applicable to us.
[00:47:20.980 --> 00:47:26.820]   We are taking step by step headed toward this scene where we're going to be joining them
[00:47:26.820 --> 00:47:30.160]   in eternity.
[00:47:30.160 --> 00:47:36.100]   And I hope that you can just really have that imprinted in your mind so that anything that
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:43.420]   causes you to trivialize this is harmful to you, is actually doing great damage to your
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:45.500]   walk with God.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:52.420]   And anything, even suffering and difficulty, that causes you to long more for this is the
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.820]   best thing that God desires of us.
[00:47:55.820 --> 00:48:03.480]   So as we take time to fellowship, the discussion questions that I have is related to this vision.
[00:48:03.480 --> 00:48:06.820]   How has your imagination of heaven changed from when you first became a Christian to
[00:48:06.820 --> 00:48:09.260]   now, if any?
[00:48:09.260 --> 00:48:12.580]   Maybe some of you guys may remember when you weren't a Christian or when you were a young
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.820]   Christian what you imagined.
[00:48:14.820 --> 00:48:17.740]   Now that you've had some time to study the Word of God, maybe even some of the things
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:22.040]   that you saw this week, how does that change your view of heaven?
[00:48:22.040 --> 00:48:24.900]   What aspect of corporate worship do you look forward to each week?
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:27.940]   What aspect of private worship do you enjoy the most?
[00:48:27.940 --> 00:48:34.180]   If worship is the central activity of a Christian now and in future, what is it about that that
[00:48:34.180 --> 00:48:37.660]   you look forward to the most?
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:41.780]   What is something that you can practically do to help you prepare for corporate worship
[00:48:41.780 --> 00:48:42.780]   each week?
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:47.460]   And again, this is something that we try to encourage you week after week.
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:55.340]   There's a huge difference between attending worship and giving worship.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:59.000]   There's a huge difference between attending worship and giving worship.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:04.340]   You can attend worship every single week and never truly worship God.
[00:49:04.340 --> 00:49:08.380]   Showing up and sitting down and listening to sermon and giving your money isn't worship,
[00:49:08.380 --> 00:49:09.380]   and you know that.
[00:49:09.380 --> 00:49:13.180]   Jesus said he's not looking for people who are going to worship in this mountain or that
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:17.740]   mountain or this amount or this church or at this time or sing these songs.
[00:49:17.740 --> 00:49:23.500]   He said true worship is something that you choose to give.
[00:49:23.500 --> 00:49:25.460]   You sing because it's time to sing.
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.900]   You give because it's time to give.
[00:49:26.900 --> 00:49:31.860]   But there's a huge difference between somebody who's come to give worship to God.
[00:49:31.860 --> 00:49:35.980]   So the question is, how do you prepare for corporate worship?
[00:49:35.980 --> 00:49:41.380]   If that's the central thing that you've been saved for, not so that you can keep breathing
[00:49:41.380 --> 00:49:46.220]   when you die, but so that what you lost at the fall can be restored, that you can be
[00:49:46.220 --> 00:49:49.900]   his image bearer and you can be true worshipers.
[00:49:49.900 --> 00:49:55.380]   If that's the central thing that he created, that he saved us for, how central is it in
[00:49:55.380 --> 00:49:56.460]   your life?
[00:49:56.460 --> 00:49:57.540]   How do you prepare for it?
[00:49:57.540 --> 00:49:59.340]   So that's the third question.
[00:49:59.340 --> 00:50:04.420]   Four, how does or should the knowledge of God's holiness affect the way we approach worship?
[00:50:04.420 --> 00:50:10.580]   Again, that question is a much larger question than just Sunday worship, but the way we live.
[00:50:10.580 --> 00:50:15.140]   How does his character of holy, holy holiness, other than the fact that Christ absorbed our
[00:50:15.140 --> 00:50:20.380]   penalty, the fact that the God that dwells in us, right?
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:24.460]   The Holy Spirit that is holy, holy, holy makes a dwelling in us.
[00:50:24.460 --> 00:50:27.480]   How does that affect the way you live?
[00:50:27.480 --> 00:50:28.880]   How does that affect the way you make judgments?
[00:50:28.880 --> 00:50:32.900]   How do you discern what is right and wrong based upon his character?
[00:50:32.900 --> 00:50:35.600]   He says be holy because he is holy.
[00:50:35.600 --> 00:50:41.420]   So when we think about that this attribute is mentioned three times and it's mentioned
[00:50:41.420 --> 00:50:47.060]   in two separate places, and heaven is a place where it's primarily for the purpose of worship,
[00:50:47.060 --> 00:50:49.040]   how does that affect our worship?
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.160]   How does that affect what we do?
[00:50:51.160 --> 00:50:54.160]   So let me invite you guys to be in your small groups.
[00:50:54.160 --> 00:50:59.880]   I'm going to pray for us and then you guys can take some time in your small groups.
[00:50:59.880 --> 00:51:06.200]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening and we thank you, Father God, for giving us
[00:51:06.200 --> 00:51:14.020]   a glimpse of where we're headed and what is happening, Lord God, in your throne.
[00:51:14.020 --> 00:51:19.720]   That even though we may not clearly understand some of the descriptions and what is taking
[00:51:19.720 --> 00:51:27.280]   place, we know, Father God, that you are more than deserving of all that we have to worship
[00:51:27.280 --> 00:51:33.160]   you with our mouths, our lives, our finances, our time.
[00:51:33.160 --> 00:51:39.400]   Help us, Lord, to examine our lives and that your word would judge the thoughts and intentions
[00:51:39.400 --> 00:51:47.020]   of our heart, that we would not simply coast along in religiousness, but we would be careful
[00:51:47.020 --> 00:51:49.240]   to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:51:49.240 --> 00:51:54.560]   So I pray that you would bless our small group time, that we would be open, and that things
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.640]   we share would be iron sharpening iron for one another.
[00:51:57.640 --> 00:51:59.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:51:59.400 --> 00:52:09.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
