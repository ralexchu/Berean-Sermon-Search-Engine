[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:09.160]   - Well, John Piper is a prolific journaler in private,
[00:00:09.160 --> 00:00:12.560]   and many of you know that already, but why does he do it?
[00:00:12.560 --> 00:00:14.840]   Today we find out thanks to this question
[00:00:14.840 --> 00:00:16.900]   from a podcast listener.
[00:00:16.900 --> 00:00:19.040]   Pastor John, hello, my name is Danny.
[00:00:19.040 --> 00:00:22.360]   As a 19-year-old, I'm interested in starting a journal
[00:00:22.360 --> 00:00:26.280]   to track the outworking of God's providence in my life.
[00:00:27.120 --> 00:00:30.080]   I know that you have journaled for a long time.
[00:00:30.080 --> 00:00:32.500]   When did you start, why did you start,
[00:00:32.500 --> 00:00:35.560]   and how much time do you spend journaling each day?
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:38.120]   And why do you continue to do it today,
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:39.540]   assuming you still do?
[00:00:39.540 --> 00:00:44.140]   - Right, well, I do still journal,
[00:00:44.140 --> 00:00:46.000]   but it might not be what people think.
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   Let me begin by saying behind my practice
[00:00:52.440 --> 00:00:57.440]   of writing in my journal are some huge assumptions
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:01.400]   that I should probably make explicit.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:06.400]   One is that an infinitely holy, wise, powerful,
[00:01:06.400 --> 00:01:12.520]   good, loving, just God exists.
[00:01:12.520 --> 00:01:16.600]   That he created the world and everything in it
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.280]   and has absolute authority and rights
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.280]   over everything in the world, including me,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.280]   and that I, by nature, am selfish to the core
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.060]   and in rebellion against him
[00:01:32.060 --> 00:01:37.060]   and constantly prone in my self, my old self,
[00:01:37.060 --> 00:01:43.060]   constantly prone to exalt myself above him and above others,
[00:01:43.060 --> 00:01:46.640]   and that he owes me nothing,
[00:01:46.640 --> 00:01:49.720]   but that I deserve his just anger.
[00:01:49.720 --> 00:01:52.360]   And yet, these are all assumptions
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:53.640]   that I bring to journaling,
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:58.640]   and yet he sent his divine, eternal son, Jesus Christ,
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:01.920]   into the world to deliver me from the guilt
[00:02:01.920 --> 00:02:04.640]   and the power of this selfishness
[00:02:04.640 --> 00:02:07.280]   by dying in my place, bearing my guilt,
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:09.960]   providing my righteousness, rising again,
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.800]   pouring out his Holy Spirit of repentance and faith on me
[00:02:14.800 --> 00:02:19.800]   so that I was brought out of darkness into light
[00:02:19.800 --> 00:02:23.080]   with the divine purpose over my life
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:26.880]   that I would prefer him over every earthly good
[00:02:26.880 --> 00:02:31.880]   and be holy as he is holy and shine in what I write
[00:02:31.880 --> 00:02:36.920]   and in what I think and in what I feel and in what I do,
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:40.620]   shine with the light of his glory in this world,
[00:02:40.620 --> 00:02:44.220]   which means all of that is a massive set
[00:02:44.220 --> 00:02:48.640]   of glorious realities, assumptions that I bring
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.420]   to whether or not I journal,
[00:02:51.420 --> 00:02:55.900]   which means that my whole life is devoted
[00:02:55.900 --> 00:03:00.400]   to seeking out ways with God's guidance in his word,
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.400]   ways of pursuing this holiness, this likeness to Christ,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.220]   this shining, this reflection of what he is,
[00:03:10.220 --> 00:03:15.220]   ways of pursuing seeing him and clarifying what he's like
[00:03:15.220 --> 00:03:19.840]   and keeping him before me as my daily satisfaction
[00:03:19.840 --> 00:03:24.840]   and peace and confidence so that I am conformed increasingly
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.600]   to his character and his ways.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.820]   Over my life, I just see flying these,
[00:03:32.820 --> 00:03:36.180]   not only glorious promises and works of God,
[00:03:36.180 --> 00:03:40.380]   but commands, "God has not called us to impurity,
[00:03:40.380 --> 00:03:44.260]   "but to holiness," 1 Thessalonians 4.
[00:03:44.260 --> 00:03:45.860]   "As he who called you is holy,
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.200]   "be holy in all your conduct.
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:51.620]   "Strive for holiness without which no one will see the Lord.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:54.300]   "You must be perfect as your heavenly father is perfect."
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:59.300]   So journaling for me is part of a constant quest
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:05.820]   to see Christ and know Christ and enjoy Christ
[00:04:05.820 --> 00:04:10.820]   and be like Christ so I live to the glory of Christ.
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:14.500]   Now, I'm pretty sure, Tony,
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:19.500]   that I would not have articulated my motives
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:24.300]   in journaling that way at every point in my life.
[00:04:24.300 --> 00:04:27.480]   That's the way I think about it today.
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:31.900]   And it's interesting that Danny would say he's 19
[00:04:31.900 --> 00:04:35.860]   because I think I'm accurate in saying
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:39.020]   I began journaling when I was 19
[00:04:39.020 --> 00:04:42.460]   as a sophomore at Wheaton College,
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:45.300]   and I've been doing it on and off ever since.
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.740]   There may have been seasons,
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:50.940]   I think there were seasons in the last 53 years
[00:04:50.940 --> 00:04:53.820]   of journaling when I felt a commitment
[00:04:53.820 --> 00:04:56.620]   to write something every day or every week.
[00:04:56.620 --> 00:05:00.140]   But by and large, I've never approached it that way.
[00:05:00.140 --> 00:05:03.180]   I'm not keeping a diary.
[00:05:03.180 --> 00:05:05.220]   So let's make that distinction clear.
[00:05:05.220 --> 00:05:07.840]   My journaling is what I would call
[00:05:07.840 --> 00:05:11.540]   an occasional thought notebook, not a diary.
[00:05:11.540 --> 00:05:16.140]   You wouldn't find there an account of my daily activities.
[00:05:16.140 --> 00:05:19.140]   I may have done that once or twice in 50 years,
[00:05:19.140 --> 00:05:22.940]   but by and large, I'm not doing what John Wesley did
[00:05:22.940 --> 00:05:25.520]   of morning till night, here's what happened.
[00:05:26.780 --> 00:05:31.780]   I think I began because I needed to sort out my thoughts.
[00:05:31.780 --> 00:05:38.140]   In other words, I found so much confusion
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.140]   and uncertainty in my mind about so many things
[00:05:43.140 --> 00:05:48.940]   that it was very hard to know what to think or feel or do.
[00:05:48.940 --> 00:05:53.540]   That's a great impediment to obedience.
[00:05:53.540 --> 00:05:57.140]   It's a great impediment to glorifying Christ
[00:05:57.140 --> 00:06:01.700]   if you're constantly confused about what the Bible means
[00:06:01.700 --> 00:06:03.060]   and how to apply it.
[00:06:03.060 --> 00:06:08.060]   So I needed clarity about Bible passages.
[00:06:08.060 --> 00:06:11.140]   I needed clarity about the will of God
[00:06:11.140 --> 00:06:13.960]   and the pros and cons of various paths for my life.
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.580]   I needed clarity about relationships,
[00:06:17.580 --> 00:06:19.900]   that what they should look like.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:24.420]   Friends, in the early days, a girlfriend or not a girlfriend
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:29.420]   and friends and now wife and children and grandchildren,
[00:06:29.420 --> 00:06:34.420]   clarity about social issues and ethical issues.
[00:06:34.420 --> 00:06:36.740]   And I was discovering at age 19
[00:06:36.740 --> 00:06:39.780]   what today I know to be a fact,
[00:06:39.780 --> 00:06:44.780]   namely, I cannot get clarity in my mind
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:47.860]   about biblical texts or the will of God
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:50.860]   or relationships or ethical or social issues.
[00:06:50.860 --> 00:06:55.860]   I can't get clarity in my mind without writing.
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.260]   I read somewhere that Albert Einstein
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:01.860]   could hold an idea in his head for hours and days
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:03.940]   and weeks at a time and come at it
[00:07:03.940 --> 00:07:05.820]   from a dozen different angles,
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:07.600]   probing and pondering and relating
[00:07:07.600 --> 00:07:09.420]   all these various perspectives to each other
[00:07:09.420 --> 00:07:13.740]   until he got clarity about some massive insight.
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:18.740]   And well, I cannot do that in my head.
[00:07:18.740 --> 00:07:23.860]   I lose the train of thought
[00:07:23.860 --> 00:07:27.120]   as soon as the tracks split into two,
[00:07:27.120 --> 00:07:31.860]   let alone 22 or 42.
[00:07:31.860 --> 00:07:35.440]   And those tracks of thought must split
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.060]   because they are various routes of analysis
[00:07:39.060 --> 00:07:41.900]   and angles by which you have to ask lots and lots
[00:07:41.900 --> 00:07:45.260]   of questions about an issue, whatever the issue is.
[00:07:45.260 --> 00:07:47.780]   You have to come at it from so many different ways.
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:50.440]   I can't hold all that in my head
[00:07:50.440 --> 00:07:53.560]   and figure out how all those angles relate to each other
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:56.400]   and what the stages of the arguments are
[00:07:56.400 --> 00:07:58.660]   and what the implications of one insight
[00:07:58.660 --> 00:08:00.380]   has to do with another insight.
[00:08:00.380 --> 00:08:06.200]   Anybody except an Einstein hold all that in your head.
[00:08:06.200 --> 00:08:09.300]   Now, of course, you don't have to do this kind of thing
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:10.140]   in a journal.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.940]   You can just do it in random notes,
[00:08:11.940 --> 00:08:13.580]   sheets of paper, documents.
[00:08:13.580 --> 00:08:15.620]   It can be scattered all over your computer,
[00:08:15.620 --> 00:08:18.220]   all over your desk and your drawers and your files,
[00:08:18.220 --> 00:08:21.660]   which probably isn't helpful.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.820]   Scattered insights that you can never find again
[00:08:24.820 --> 00:08:28.600]   are not helpful, which brings me to another reason
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:29.860]   why it's good to do journal,
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:32.240]   namely because you wanna keep everything
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:35.400]   in some kind of place or sequence
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.240]   or use an index or system or something
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:43.060]   so that you can cross-reference and file things.
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.180]   When you look at Jonathan Edwards' notebooks, it's amazing.
[00:08:46.180 --> 00:08:47.820]   He didn't have any computer or anything,
[00:08:47.820 --> 00:08:52.140]   and he'd say, "See number 1,235."
[00:08:52.140 --> 00:08:55.620]   So you know where to look for things over the years.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:08:58.060]   So I've tried to keep a little index
[00:08:58.060 --> 00:09:01.940]   at the end of each of these journal volumes.
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:08.900]   This has been very good for my humility and thankfulness.
[00:09:09.800 --> 00:09:14.800]   Frankly, I don't like the John Piper of my early journals.
[00:09:14.800 --> 00:09:22.640]   He seems to me to be immature, self-absorbed,
[00:09:22.640 --> 00:09:24.280]   excessively critical.
[00:09:24.280 --> 00:09:30.580]   And if you're honest, your journal really does bear witness
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:34.360]   to your sins, even when you are talking
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:36.220]   about someone else's sins,
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:38.660]   maybe especially when you're talking
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.660]   about someone else's sins, which is humiliating.
[00:09:43.660 --> 00:09:45.500]   It really is.
[00:09:45.500 --> 00:09:49.440]   I mean, I knew at certain points along the way,
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:51.440]   I knew what I was doing.
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:54.360]   I knew this is gonna bite.
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:58.080]   This is gonna come back to bite me someday.
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:10:02.640]   And I thought, it's just better to be real.
[00:10:02.640 --> 00:10:07.640]   I mean, if Christianity and John Piper have any reality,
[00:10:08.640 --> 00:10:11.120]   it's either gonna be there or it's not.
[00:10:11.120 --> 00:10:13.760]   There's no point trying to fake anything.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:20.020]   So on the other hand, that very fact of humiliation
[00:10:20.020 --> 00:10:26.320]   causes me to be amazed at the mercy and the patience
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:31.440]   and the grace of God in Jesus Christ.
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:36.460]   God could have justifiably thrown me away at any time,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.200]   and my journals, my own journals,
[00:10:42.200 --> 00:10:45.880]   I think would have been adequate evidence
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:49.240]   at the judgment day that he did me no wrong.
[00:10:49.240 --> 00:10:51.720]   And maybe I should make just a little clearer
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.560]   when I talk about sorting through relationships
[00:10:55.560 --> 00:10:56.880]   and ethical issues.
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.280]   This really does include my life.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.280]   I'm not just talking abstract, my life,
[00:11:03.280 --> 00:11:07.040]   my family, my children, my wife, my workplace,
[00:11:07.040 --> 00:11:10.320]   my colleagues, my struggles in the ministry.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:14.880]   Over the years, there have always been crises in my life
[00:11:14.880 --> 00:11:16.640]   that have been very painful,
[00:11:16.640 --> 00:11:21.400]   as well as other experiences that have been exquisitely happy
[00:11:21.400 --> 00:11:23.000]   and I write about these.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.600]   I try to sort through what's wrong.
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:28.120]   Why is the marriage the way it is?
[00:11:28.120 --> 00:11:29.360]   Why are my kids the way they are?
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.580]   Why are things at Bethlehem the way they were?
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:33.060]   How are we doing at DG?
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.280]   Et cetera, et cetera.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.960]   All kinds of issues that I'm facing,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.480]   I need to just sort it out.
[00:11:40.480 --> 00:11:44.760]   So when I say that my journal is a thought notebook
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:47.960]   for trying to get clarity about texts
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:49.720]   and the will of God and relationships
[00:11:49.720 --> 00:11:51.320]   and social and ethical issues,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:56.320]   I don't mean that to sound theoretical or abstract.
[00:11:56.320 --> 00:12:00.260]   Think very concrete, very personal,
[00:12:00.260 --> 00:12:03.040]   and often very painful.
[00:12:03.040 --> 00:12:05.060]   It might, just in closing here,
[00:12:05.060 --> 00:12:09.200]   it might put a whole different slant
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:14.080]   on the term occasional thought notebook or on journaling.
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:19.080]   If I told you or I told Danny that journaling is for me,
[00:12:19.080 --> 00:12:23.640]   often like going to see a personal counselor
[00:12:23.640 --> 00:12:28.640]   where I tell him all my problems and seek his wisdom
[00:12:28.640 --> 00:12:32.120]   and the journal is the counselor's office
[00:12:32.120 --> 00:12:34.920]   and he lets me pour out my confusion,
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:39.080]   my feelings and ideas about my problems.
[00:12:39.080 --> 00:12:41.280]   And he listens very patiently.
[00:12:41.280 --> 00:12:42.840]   (laughing)
[00:12:42.840 --> 00:12:44.200]   He's totally silent.
[00:12:44.200 --> 00:12:49.600]   He waits for me in silence to pray
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:53.120]   and then he leads me by the Spirit
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:57.300]   to passages of scripture where I see Jesus more clearly
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:12:59.760]   and find hope and guidance.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:04.600]   So a word to Danny, Danny, we're all so different.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:08.840]   There's no biblical requirement that anybody keep a journal,
[00:13:08.840 --> 00:13:11.120]   let alone any particular kind.
[00:13:11.120 --> 00:13:14.240]   There is a biblical requirement that all of us
[00:13:14.240 --> 00:13:19.240]   pursue a clear, transforming knowledge of Jesus
[00:13:19.240 --> 00:13:22.000]   and that we walk in holiness.
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:25.200]   And if journaling helps you get that clarity
[00:13:25.200 --> 00:13:28.680]   and walk that walk, do it.
[00:13:28.680 --> 00:13:30.200]   - Amen, that's good insight
[00:13:30.200 --> 00:13:31.720]   in your own journaling practices.
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:32.720]   Thank you, Pastor John.

[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:00.160]   we return and I'll ask Pastor John
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:03.000]   why does he seem to avoid talking politics
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:05.880]   and what's hot and trending on Twitter?
[00:14:05.880 --> 00:14:07.120]   It's a really good question.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:07.960]   That's Monday.
[00:14:07.960 --> 00:14:08.800]   I'm your host Tony Reinhke.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:09.640]   We'll see you then.
[00:14:09.640 --> 00:14:12.220]   (upbeat music)
