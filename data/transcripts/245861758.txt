[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.480]   All right, let me pray for us and we'll start.
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:14.760]   Father we thank you for this evening.
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.520]   We thank you for just watching over us.
[00:00:17.520 --> 00:00:22.120]   Thank you for the holidays and time that we were able to spend with our families.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.640]   I pray, Father God, that your word would continue to speak to us.
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:32.120]   It would transform our inner being, our thoughts of you, your second coming, especially as
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:39.360]   we meditate, Lord God, on who you are and what you have promised.
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:45.560]   I pray that this will be more than just greater knowledge and theology, but the reality, Lord
[00:00:45.560 --> 00:00:52.240]   God, of who you are would change us, motivate us, and move us that we may live in obedience,
[00:00:52.240 --> 00:00:54.000]   Lord God, as you called us.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:59.560]   I pray that you would bless this time, that your word would speak and judge the thoughts
[00:00:59.560 --> 00:01:00.760]   and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:00.760 --> 00:01:04.240]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:04.240 --> 00:01:05.960]   All right, so we have two main sections.
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:12.440]   The first, chapter 22, verse 1 through 5 or 1 through 6, is a continuation of chapter
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:16.480]   21 where there's a description of the river of life.
[00:01:16.480 --> 00:01:22.240]   What I wanted you to do for the first part of it is...
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:25.240]   Sorry.
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   Sorry.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   There it is.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:47.040]   I don't know why that didn't come up.
[00:01:47.040 --> 00:01:51.480]   So what I would like you to do is take a few minutes with your neighbors.
[00:01:51.480 --> 00:01:58.560]   So the description of chapter 22, verses 1 through 5, where it talks about a river coming
[00:01:58.560 --> 00:02:01.720]   from the throne of God and a description that it has.
[00:02:01.720 --> 00:02:05.920]   And in Psalm chapter 1, some of you guys may know that passage where it says, verses 1
[00:02:05.920 --> 00:02:09.120]   and 2, "Blessed is the man who is walking in the counsel of the wicked, standing in
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:11.280]   the way of sinners, sinners, sinners, and immoral people, but is delighted in the law
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:12.760]   of the Lord."
[00:02:12.760 --> 00:02:14.920]   And what is he like, verses 3 to 6.
[00:02:14.920 --> 00:02:18.760]   So what I want you to do is take a look at those two passages and see how many similarities
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.320]   that you can find.
[00:02:21.320 --> 00:02:23.720]   And you can just talk to your neighbors if you want.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.720]   I'll just give you a few minutes.
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:33.040]   Okay.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:51.160]   You should be able to find at least three or more.
[00:02:51.160 --> 00:02:54.320]   (audience chattering)
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:57.320]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:23.180]   - How many have you found?
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:24.580]   How many have you found?
[00:03:24.580 --> 00:03:25.420]   At least three.
[00:03:25.420 --> 00:03:27.900]   Four.
[00:03:27.900 --> 00:03:31.380]   Oh really, three?
[00:03:31.380 --> 00:03:32.380]   That was it, three?
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.220]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:35.220 --> 00:03:36.820]   Everybody found three, huh?
[00:03:36.820 --> 00:03:37.660]   Not four?
[00:03:37.660 --> 00:03:40.940]   Okay, so what are the three?
[00:03:40.940 --> 00:03:41.980]   Just yell it out.
[00:03:41.980 --> 00:03:45.140]   Okay, fruit.
[00:03:45.140 --> 00:03:48.260]   Yeah, water.
[00:03:51.260 --> 00:03:54.300]   (audience laughing)
[00:03:54.300 --> 00:03:55.140]   Tree.
[00:03:55.140 --> 00:03:58.860]   Leaves, that's four already, four leaves.
[00:03:58.860 --> 00:04:02.940]   Is that it?
[00:04:02.940 --> 00:04:09.860]   Hmm?
[00:04:09.860 --> 00:04:14.820]   What about Wicked Sinners?
[00:04:14.820 --> 00:04:18.940]   Okay, they won't be in there.
[00:04:18.940 --> 00:04:20.400]   Okay.
[00:04:20.400 --> 00:04:21.240]   What else?
[00:04:21.380 --> 00:04:25.640]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:37.020]   Okay, well I wanted you to take a look at this passage
[00:04:37.020 --> 00:04:39.420]   because in Psalm chapter one it says,
[00:04:39.420 --> 00:04:43.180]   "The man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,"
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.540]   and then he says, "But his delight is in the law of the Lord."
[00:04:45.540 --> 00:04:48.940]   In other words, the one who lives in obedience to God's law,
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:51.560]   he is like a man whose trees are planted
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:53.440]   by the streams of water, right?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:55.400]   It's planted by the streams of water,
[00:04:55.400 --> 00:04:58.440]   meaning that he's being sustained constantly.
[00:04:58.440 --> 00:05:01.000]   Somebody doesn't need to come and pour water
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.460]   onto this thing because the water is constant.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:08.460]   And so because of that, it yields its fruit in season.
[00:05:08.460 --> 00:05:10.560]   In other words, it's a sign of life.
[00:05:10.560 --> 00:05:13.000]   And its leaf does not wither.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.920]   Again, all of this is a sign of life
[00:05:15.920 --> 00:05:17.880]   and whatever he does prospers.
[00:05:17.880 --> 00:05:20.560]   And then he talks about how the wicked will not enter,
[00:05:20.560 --> 00:05:22.180]   but he knows the way of the righteous.
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.340]   He knows who they are, right?
[00:05:24.340 --> 00:05:27.180]   So if you look at 22, one through five,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:29.140]   the angel showed me the river of water of life,
[00:05:29.140 --> 00:05:31.700]   bright as a crystal flowing from the throne of God
[00:05:31.700 --> 00:05:32.820]   and Abdelham.
[00:05:32.820 --> 00:05:36.340]   So here, right, where here it says,
[00:05:36.340 --> 00:05:39.660]   "He who delights in the law of the Lord," right?
[00:05:39.660 --> 00:05:41.220]   Or here it says the river actually
[00:05:41.220 --> 00:05:42.740]   is coming from God himself.
[00:05:42.740 --> 00:05:46.380]   And so what is the word, right?
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:49.600]   In this passage, God himself is either side of the river,
[00:05:49.600 --> 00:05:52.700]   the trees of life, and the 12 kinds of fruit,
[00:05:52.700 --> 00:05:55.520]   yielding fruit each month, meaning in season.
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:58.280]   It's gonna be in season all the time, right?
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:01.480]   That it's not just quarterly, it's not just a harvest.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.480]   But in heaven, the distinction is it's gonna bear fruit,
[00:06:05.480 --> 00:06:06.780]   but it's gonna be constant.
[00:06:06.780 --> 00:06:10.760]   The leaves of the tree were for the healing of the nations.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:12.880]   In other words, again, the idea of the leaves
[00:06:12.880 --> 00:06:15.000]   not withering and its functioning.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.920]   No longer will there be anything accursed.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.200]   Again, the wicked will not be entering.
[00:06:19.200 --> 00:06:22.600]   They will see his face and his name will be on their forehead.
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.840]   So on the bottom, it talks about how the wicked
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:26.800]   will not enter, but that he knows the ways
[00:06:26.800 --> 00:06:27.880]   of the righteous.
[00:06:27.880 --> 00:06:30.040]   And he says those who will be there
[00:06:30.040 --> 00:06:33.160]   will have his mark on his forehead, right?
[00:06:33.160 --> 00:06:35.320]   And night will be no more,
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:36.920]   there will be no light of lamp or sun,
[00:06:36.920 --> 00:06:39.480]   for the Lord God will be their light
[00:06:39.480 --> 00:06:41.660]   and they will reign forever and ever.
[00:06:41.660 --> 00:06:43.560]   So the reason why I wanted to show you this
[00:06:43.560 --> 00:06:46.560]   is because Psalm chapter one begins
[00:06:46.560 --> 00:06:49.680]   the whole book of Psalm with that statement,
[00:06:49.680 --> 00:06:52.040]   blessed is the man who does this.
[00:06:52.040 --> 00:06:53.720]   Who's not doing this, who does this.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.960]   And so everything that is laid out in the book of Psalm
[00:06:56.960 --> 00:07:00.480]   is basically summarizing what he says in chapter one.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:03.520]   And then he kind of stems out from there, right?
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:06.920]   So basically that description of a blessed man
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:09.640]   is the one who clings close to his word.
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:12.220]   Living in obedience, right?
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.280]   Clings to God.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.080]   And so when we get to heaven,
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:17.040]   that blessed man, again now,
[00:07:17.040 --> 00:07:18.480]   instead of striving toward God,
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:20.400]   God's going to actually be there.
[00:07:20.400 --> 00:07:22.040]   And as a result of that,
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:24.320]   that there's gonna be constant fruit,
[00:07:24.320 --> 00:07:27.000]   leaves are going to be a blessing,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.080]   no wickedness there and God's gonna know them, right?
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:31.720]   You're not gonna have to worry
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:33.680]   or just try to distinguish between who is
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:34.740]   and who is not of God,
[00:07:34.740 --> 00:07:38.000]   because in heaven they will all be of God, right?
[00:07:38.640 --> 00:07:41.400]   (pages rustling)
[00:07:41.400 --> 00:07:44.400]   So the first section,
[00:07:44.400 --> 00:07:45.600]   when we talk about the river of life,
[00:07:45.600 --> 00:07:48.020]   obviously it's promised in Psalm chapter one,
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:49.920]   which we just saw.
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:51.740]   And the river flows from the throne of God,
[00:07:51.740 --> 00:07:54.400]   signifying God being the source of this living water.
[00:07:54.400 --> 00:07:58.900]   So there's not an external source or something else,
[00:07:58.900 --> 00:08:02.060]   but God himself is gonna be the source of life.
[00:08:02.060 --> 00:08:06.580]   And we will see his face in verse four, right?
[00:08:07.500 --> 00:08:09.960]   And this specific is a fulfillment of promise,
[00:08:09.960 --> 00:08:14.160]   which we're gonna, I'll come back to this, right?
[00:08:14.160 --> 00:08:15.640]   In first Corinthians 13, 12, it says,
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:19.120]   "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:08:19.120 --> 00:08:21.180]   "Now I know in part, then I shall know fully,
[00:08:21.180 --> 00:08:25.640]   "even as I have been fully known by him."
[00:08:25.640 --> 00:08:28.360]   So the description of heaven is,
[00:08:28.360 --> 00:08:32.120]   a glimpse of his glory that he showed us,
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:34.360]   when we get to heaven, we're gonna see fully.
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   And it will be clear who belongs to him.
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:48.820]   Remember in Matthew chapter 13, 24 through 30, right?
[00:08:48.820 --> 00:08:51.340]   He talks about the wheat and the tares.
[00:08:51.340 --> 00:08:52.900]   The kingdom of heaven may be compared to a man
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:55.060]   who sowed good seed in his field,
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:08:56.720]   but while his men were sleeping,
[00:08:56.720 --> 00:08:58.840]   his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:00.100]   and went away.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:02.420]   So when the plants came up and bore grain,
[00:09:02.420 --> 00:09:04.440]   then the weeds appeared also.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:05.940]   And the servants of the master of the house
[00:09:05.940 --> 00:09:06.780]   came and said to him,
[00:09:06.780 --> 00:09:09.160]   "Master, did you not sow good seed in your field?
[00:09:09.160 --> 00:09:11.480]   "How then does it have weeds?"
[00:09:11.480 --> 00:09:13.340]   He said to them, "An enemy has done this."
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:14.320]   So the servant said to them,
[00:09:14.320 --> 00:09:17.100]   "Then do you want us to go and gather them?"
[00:09:17.100 --> 00:09:19.820]   But he said, "No, lest in gathering the weeds,
[00:09:19.820 --> 00:09:22.720]   "you root up the wheat along with them.
[00:09:22.720 --> 00:09:24.540]   "Let both grow together unto the harvest.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:26.820]   "And at the harvest time, I will tell the reapers,
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.140]   "gather weeds first and bind them in bundles to be burned,
[00:09:29.140 --> 00:09:31.620]   "but gather the wheat into my barns."
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:35.700]   So this prophecy, this promise has been fulfilled.
[00:09:35.700 --> 00:09:37.420]   And so now we're up in heaven
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:40.180]   and the tears have been wiped out
[00:09:40.180 --> 00:09:43.320]   and only true fruit remains.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:45.740]   The reason why I wanted to point this out
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:50.340]   is because church is,
[00:09:50.340 --> 00:09:52.500]   obviously we are not in heaven,
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:54.540]   but this is where God reigns.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.160]   So we're kind of in between the world
[00:09:56.160 --> 00:09:57.780]   where we're not in the world,
[00:09:57.780 --> 00:09:59.940]   but we're not quite in heaven yet.
[00:09:59.940 --> 00:10:01.900]   And so a lot of times the disappointment
[00:10:01.900 --> 00:10:06.140]   that we have in churches is we expect heaven to be here.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:07.460]   And we say, "Oh, Christians should be different.
[00:10:07.460 --> 00:10:08.500]   "Christians should be different."
[00:10:08.500 --> 00:10:10.660]   You're right, Christians should be different,
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.060]   but we're not in our final state.
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:16.200]   I hear so many statistics about how Christians do this
[00:10:16.200 --> 00:10:17.080]   and Christians do that.
[00:10:17.080 --> 00:10:20.700]   And I wonder how much of those statistics
[00:10:20.700 --> 00:10:23.820]   are statistics of true Christians
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.740]   or just statistics of the number of people
[00:10:25.740 --> 00:10:27.140]   who attend church.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:29.620]   So if we were to actually take the statistics
[00:10:29.620 --> 00:10:31.300]   of genuine Christians in the church,
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:34.900]   I don't believe that a lot of those statistics will be true.
[00:10:34.900 --> 00:10:36.480]   And when we get to heaven,
[00:10:36.480 --> 00:10:38.140]   it says that they're gonna be separated
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:40.700]   and everyone who is of his is gonna be clear.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:42.300]   We're gonna be able to identify.
[00:10:42.300 --> 00:10:44.860]   The second part of it, number two,
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:45.900]   Jesus is coming soon.
[00:10:45.900 --> 00:10:48.820]   Over and over again in this passage,
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.400]   we are reminded, "Behold, I am coming soon."
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:53.300]   Revelation 22, seven, "I am coming soon.
[00:10:53.300 --> 00:10:54.220]   "I am coming soon."
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:10:58.040]   So that's the whole theme of the book of Revelation.
[00:10:59.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   God's gonna fulfill all of his promises
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.700]   that he made in the Old Testament and the New Testament.
[00:11:03.700 --> 00:11:06.460]   And the urgency in the New Testament and to us
[00:11:06.460 --> 00:11:08.420]   is he is coming, he is coming, he is coming.
[00:11:08.420 --> 00:11:10.940]   And so there's a reason why the early church
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:12.740]   greeted each other with what?
[00:11:12.740 --> 00:11:16.820]   What was the common greeting of the early church?
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:20.780]   Anybody remember?
[00:11:20.780 --> 00:11:21.700]   Starts with an M.
[00:11:21.700 --> 00:11:25.020]   Not mahalo.
[00:11:25.020 --> 00:11:26.380]   (congregation laughing)
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:28.560]   Maranatha, right?
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:30.020]   And what does Maranatha mean?
[00:11:30.020 --> 00:11:32.980]   Come, Lord Jesus, right?
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.640]   That was the greeting of the early church.
[00:11:35.640 --> 00:11:38.500]   They would say, "Maranatha, come, Lord Jesus."
[00:11:38.500 --> 00:11:43.500]   And a lot of it is because the second coming of Christ
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:46.260]   was so prominent in the early church,
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:48.180]   in the teaching of the early church.
[00:11:48.180 --> 00:11:50.820]   So again, part of the reason why I wanted
[00:11:50.820 --> 00:11:52.220]   to go through Revelation is because
[00:11:52.220 --> 00:11:53.820]   we haven't been in it in a while.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:57.180]   I've taught this maybe about 13, 14 years ago.
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:11:58.380]   And we haven't been in it in a while,
[00:11:58.380 --> 00:12:01.060]   so I wanted to kind of refresh our church.
[00:12:01.060 --> 00:12:04.180]   But the idea of the second coming
[00:12:04.180 --> 00:12:07.380]   sometimes becomes so sensationalized
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:09.260]   where we get into the debate of,
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:13.420]   like, is Kim Jong-un the Antichrist?
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:16.140]   And where does America fit in?
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:18.860]   We get into so many of these details
[00:12:18.860 --> 00:12:21.140]   that we wouldn't even know.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:22.480]   And sometimes it actually causes
[00:12:22.480 --> 00:12:25.540]   more confusion than it answers.
[00:12:25.540 --> 00:12:28.340]   But the other extreme is to not talk about it at all.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:30.540]   Because it's confusing, we don't think
[00:12:30.540 --> 00:12:32.020]   or talk about the second coming.
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.420]   But the doctrine of the second coming,
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:39.180]   the second coming of Christ was central
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.740]   to the life of the early church.
[00:12:41.740 --> 00:12:43.700]   The reason why they were willing to die
[00:12:43.700 --> 00:12:45.460]   is because they thought Jesus was gonna come
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:46.660]   and resurrect them soon.
[00:12:46.660 --> 00:12:50.060]   And the reason why they were able to live their life
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:53.140]   and not be so caught up into this world
[00:12:53.140 --> 00:12:55.700]   is because they were eagerly expecting.
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.900]   In fact, the problem with the early church
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:01.540]   wasn't that they weren't thinking about the second coming.
[00:13:01.540 --> 00:13:03.460]   Their problem was they were thinking
[00:13:03.460 --> 00:13:05.260]   so much about the second coming,
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:07.780]   some of them quit their jobs and stopped working.
[00:13:07.780 --> 00:13:11.020]   So 2 Thessalonians, Paul writes to the church
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.460]   and says, "If he does not work, let him not eat."
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:15.460]   Because a lot of the people were kind of like,
[00:13:15.460 --> 00:13:16.820]   well, if he's gonna come anyway,
[00:13:16.820 --> 00:13:18.820]   they started becoming irresponsible at home,
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:21.020]   they started becoming irresponsible at church.
[00:13:21.020 --> 00:13:22.940]   And then they were just kind of living day to day
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:24.620]   thinking like Christ's gonna come.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:26.540]   And so the problem with the early church
[00:13:26.540 --> 00:13:28.980]   wasn't that they weren't thinking enough about it,
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:30.540]   they were thinking too much
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:32.260]   where they started becoming irresponsible.
[00:13:32.260 --> 00:13:35.220]   Exact opposite problem of what we have in our generation.
[00:13:35.220 --> 00:13:38.940]   So the theme over and over again is,
[00:13:38.940 --> 00:13:41.180]   he is coming, he is coming, he is coming.
[00:13:41.180 --> 00:13:48.860]   He begins by saying his words are trustworthy, verse six.
[00:13:48.860 --> 00:13:53.540]   He said to me, "These words are trustworthy and true,
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.540]   "and the Lord, the God of the spirits of the prophets
[00:13:55.540 --> 00:13:57.940]   "has sent his angel to show his servants
[00:13:57.940 --> 00:14:00.020]   "what must soon take place."
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.580]   And again, not specifically in those words,
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:03.580]   but over and over again,
[00:14:03.580 --> 00:14:05.540]   when he says these words are trustworthy,
[00:14:05.540 --> 00:14:06.500]   what is he saying?
[00:14:06.500 --> 00:14:11.140]   What is the application of saying that this is trustworthy?
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:15.700]   Pay attention, right?
[00:14:15.700 --> 00:14:18.380]   Pay attention, that's the point that he's trying to make,
[00:14:18.380 --> 00:14:19.580]   to listen carefully.
[00:14:19.580 --> 00:14:23.820]   And he says that he is the God of the spirit
[00:14:23.820 --> 00:14:26.300]   and the prophets, referring to the revelation
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:28.540]   that came through ultimately was from him.
[00:14:28.540 --> 00:14:31.420]   So all the prophecies about the end times,
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:33.340]   about the kingdom of God,
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:35.020]   is being fulfilled through Christ.
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:43.140]   Again, to reemphasize, to pay attention.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.420]   Remember how often Jesus would say,
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.540]   he who has ears, let him hear, right?
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:53.340]   In other words, if you have faith in that I am the Messiah
[00:14:53.340 --> 00:14:56.380]   and what I'm saying is true, you must pay attention.
[00:14:56.380 --> 00:14:58.660]   So that's his point here, pay attention.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:01.780]   Not just listen, not just hear,
[00:15:01.780 --> 00:15:03.300]   but to eagerly pay attention.
[00:15:03.300 --> 00:15:11.540]   So he is coming soon, therefore keep or obey the prophecy
[00:15:11.540 --> 00:15:14.340]   given in Revelation, given.
[00:15:14.340 --> 00:15:17.780]   In verse seven he says, "And behold, I am coming soon,
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:19.580]   "blessed is the one who keeps the words
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:21.300]   "of the prophecy of this book."
[00:15:22.180 --> 00:15:27.140]   I don't know about you, but when you think of prophecy,
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:29.900]   you don't typically think of obedience, do you?
[00:15:29.900 --> 00:15:34.620]   When you think of at least the prophecy about the end times,
[00:15:34.620 --> 00:15:36.380]   about how he's gonna bring judgment,
[00:15:36.380 --> 00:15:37.940]   like what are you to obey?
[00:15:37.940 --> 00:15:40.660]   'Cause they're not imperative,
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.420]   they're not saying you need to do this.
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:46.180]   So we've been studying basically what John's been seeing.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:51.620]   You had the trumpet judgment, the seal judgments,
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:54.620]   the bowl judgments, and how there's a conflict.
[00:15:54.620 --> 00:15:57.020]   So basically it's like reading a narrative
[00:15:57.020 --> 00:15:58.660]   of what is happening in the future,
[00:15:58.660 --> 00:16:02.140]   but we don't typically think of apocalyptic writing
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.660]   as something to obey.
[00:16:03.660 --> 00:16:06.940]   But that's exactly what he says here.
[00:16:06.940 --> 00:16:09.420]   He is coming soon, behold I am coming soon,
[00:16:09.420 --> 00:16:11.700]   blessed is the one who keeps the words
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.940]   of the prophecy of this book.
[00:16:14.900 --> 00:16:18.940]   In other words, the purpose of this revelation
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.980]   is not information, but obedience.
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:25.780]   It's not so that we can end it and say,
[00:16:25.780 --> 00:16:27.700]   oh, okay, I know these are things
[00:16:27.700 --> 00:16:28.980]   that I should watch out for,
[00:16:28.980 --> 00:16:30.620]   and these are things that I should know,
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:32.940]   but the point of it was to obey.
[00:16:32.940 --> 00:16:36.860]   I am coming soon, so therefore obey, right?
[00:16:36.860 --> 00:16:44.460]   So prophecy was not simply given for information,
[00:16:44.460 --> 00:16:47.660]   but ultimately for obedience.
[00:16:47.660 --> 00:16:54.900]   And the church history has cycles
[00:16:54.900 --> 00:16:56.780]   going back and forth, back and forth,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.860]   where you have antinomianism,
[00:16:59.860 --> 00:17:02.780]   where basically any teaching of the law
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:07.220]   is indicted as legalism, pharisaic,
[00:17:07.220 --> 00:17:10.660]   and then you have the other spectrum
[00:17:10.660 --> 00:17:13.520]   where you're almost kind of like legalistic,
[00:17:13.520 --> 00:17:15.860]   where if you don't follow these 14 rules
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:17.180]   that you're not a real Christian.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:19.620]   In church history, the pendulum shifts
[00:17:19.620 --> 00:17:21.620]   back and forth and back and forth,
[00:17:21.620 --> 00:17:24.420]   and I think we live in a generation today
[00:17:24.420 --> 00:17:27.920]   of antinomianism, at least not in every circle,
[00:17:27.920 --> 00:17:31.140]   but largely where called to holiness,
[00:17:31.140 --> 00:17:32.540]   there's a resistance.
[00:17:32.540 --> 00:17:36.220]   There was a period even in my Christian walk
[00:17:36.220 --> 00:17:38.900]   where that wasn't the case, but I see that today,
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:41.260]   that generally speaking, when you push
[00:17:41.260 --> 00:17:43.960]   toward holiness and obedience, there's a pushback,
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:47.760]   and the pushback typically is legalism, right?
[00:17:47.760 --> 00:17:50.800]   Because if you preach the true gospel,
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:53.380]   you shouldn't emphasize that, right?
[00:17:53.380 --> 00:17:56.500]   I don't know how you faithfully read the scriptures.
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:59.600]   I don't know how anybody can faithfully read the scriptures
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:02.400]   and somehow nullify obedience.
[00:18:02.400 --> 00:18:03.960]   I don't know how you could do that
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   unless you pick and choose, like the cults do,
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:09.000]   certain verses to emphasize.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:10.920]   The scripture is very clear.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:14.820]   The purpose of this prophecy
[00:18:14.820 --> 00:18:18.480]   is for the purpose of obedience, right?
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:20.680]   Revelations 1:3, "Blessed is the one
[00:18:20.680 --> 00:18:22.500]   "who reads aloud the words of the prophecy,
[00:18:22.500 --> 00:18:24.280]   "and blessed are those who hear
[00:18:24.280 --> 00:18:26.340]   "and who keep what is written in it,
[00:18:26.340 --> 00:18:28.360]   "for the time is near."
[00:18:28.360 --> 00:18:32.600]   Not just the hearers, but the ones who are doing, right?
[00:18:32.600 --> 00:18:33.640]   Obedience.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.520]   John 14, 15, "If you love me,
[00:18:37.520 --> 00:18:40.080]   "you will keep my commandments."
[00:18:40.800 --> 00:18:41.640]   Right?
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:45.800]   1 John 2, 3 to 4, "And by this we know
[00:18:45.800 --> 00:18:48.920]   "that we have come to know him if we keep his commandments.
[00:18:48.920 --> 00:18:49.940]   "Whoever says, 'I know him,'
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:51.840]   "but does not keep his commandments is a liar,
[00:18:51.840 --> 00:18:53.640]   "and the truth is not in him."
[00:18:53.640 --> 00:18:59.220]   All right, 1 John 5, 2 to 3, "By this we know
[00:18:59.220 --> 00:19:00.480]   "that we love the children of God
[00:19:00.480 --> 00:19:02.440]   "when we love God and obey his commandments,
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:04.780]   "for this is the love of God, that we keep his commandments,
[00:19:04.780 --> 00:19:06.940]   "and his commandments are not burdensome."
[00:19:06.940 --> 00:19:11.940]   So, Apostle John is the one who emphasizes love.
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:13.400]   Like, we ought to love God.
[00:19:13.400 --> 00:19:15.680]   He's the one who writes the Gospel of John,
[00:19:15.680 --> 00:19:18.160]   who teaches us that Nicodemus could not get
[00:19:18.160 --> 00:19:21.680]   into the kingdom of God by his righteousness.
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:23.680]   And he also is the one who teaches us
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:26.480]   that the Samaritan woman in chapter four of John,
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:28.840]   that though she is steeped in sin, God can forgive,
[00:19:28.840 --> 00:19:31.440]   and there's a way for her to enter.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:35.160]   And yet, here's this man who clearly teaches the Gospel,
[00:19:35.160 --> 00:19:38.200]   and typically when somebody is new to their faith
[00:19:38.200 --> 00:19:39.420]   or interested in the faith,
[00:19:39.420 --> 00:19:41.140]   the first book that we introduce them to
[00:19:41.140 --> 00:19:43.080]   is the Gospel of John, right?
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:44.480]   I mean, you can go through other books,
[00:19:44.480 --> 00:19:47.720]   but the reason why Gospel of John is introduced
[00:19:47.720 --> 00:19:50.240]   is that John's Gospel is the clearest
[00:19:50.240 --> 00:19:54.440]   on the identity of Christ and the Gospel message,
[00:19:54.440 --> 00:19:57.440]   at least in the Gospels, in the four Gospels.
[00:19:57.440 --> 00:19:59.680]   And yet, if you look at John's writing,
[00:19:59.680 --> 00:20:03.000]   he emphasizes over and over again
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.280]   that does not mean that obedience is nullified.
[00:20:06.280 --> 00:20:08.760]   In fact, obedience is emphasized.
[00:20:08.760 --> 00:20:10.820]   Push to holiness is emphasized.
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:20.560]   So, study and meditation of the second coming
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:23.140]   should lead us to holy living.
[00:20:23.140 --> 00:20:28.800]   Again, this is, I'm not, again,
[00:20:28.800 --> 00:20:31.400]   I'm not saying anything that's already not written here.
[00:20:31.400 --> 00:20:33.000]   He said from the very beginning,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:36.600]   he who is blessed who hear and keep my commandments,
[00:20:36.600 --> 00:20:38.840]   and then he ends the book of Revelation by saying,
[00:20:38.840 --> 00:20:42.200]   blessed is the one who keeps the words of this prophecy.
[00:20:42.200 --> 00:20:44.600]   So, he starts with it and he ends with it.
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:48.320]   So, clearly, the point of his prophecy here
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.440]   isn't sensational.
[00:20:50.440 --> 00:20:51.840]   It's not so that you can say,
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:54.000]   oh, okay, these are the seven judgments.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:58.540]   He said there's a clear push toward obedience
[00:20:58.540 --> 00:20:59.840]   through these prophecies.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:02.600]   (pages rustling)
[00:21:02.600 --> 00:21:06.040]   Second Peter 3, 11 through 15.
[00:21:06.040 --> 00:21:07.960]   Since all these things are thus to be dissolved,
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.960]   what sort of people ought you to be
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:13.000]   in lives of holiness and godliness?
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.200]   So, Peter, again, says it here.
[00:21:15.200 --> 00:21:18.240]   If this is true, if we believe that this is true,
[00:21:18.240 --> 00:21:19.700]   and Jesus Christ is coming,
[00:21:19.700 --> 00:21:22.200]   how should that affect the way that we live?
[00:21:22.200 --> 00:21:24.560]   Waiting for and hastening the coming of the day of God
[00:21:24.560 --> 00:21:26.840]   because of which the heavens will be set on fire
[00:21:26.840 --> 00:21:28.480]   and dissolved, and the heavenly bodies
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:30.280]   will melt as they burn.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:31.480]   But according to his promise,
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:33.360]   we are waiting for a new heavens and new earth
[00:21:33.360 --> 00:21:35.040]   in which righteousness dwells.
[00:21:35.040 --> 00:21:37.520]   Therefore, beloved, since you are waiting for these,
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:39.120]   be diligent to be found by him
[00:21:39.120 --> 00:21:42.060]   without spot or blemish and at peace.
[00:21:42.060 --> 00:21:45.640]   Again, the purpose of the study of the end times
[00:21:45.640 --> 00:21:48.880]   and the coming of Christ is a push for obedience
[00:21:48.880 --> 00:21:51.580]   so that the people would have a sense of urgency.
[00:21:51.580 --> 00:21:56.920]   We all know, right, if you've been a Christian,
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.880]   even for a very short period of time,
[00:21:59.880 --> 00:22:02.200]   we all know that God saved us
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:04.480]   for the purpose of good deeds.
[00:22:04.480 --> 00:22:08.320]   But the purpose of the study of the end times
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:10.760]   is to give us a picture
[00:22:10.760 --> 00:22:13.720]   that everything that we are yearning for, coveting,
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.720]   it's gonna burn, it's gonna pass away.
[00:22:15.720 --> 00:22:20.000]   So, remember, if we were to draw a picture
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:21.040]   of the book of Revelation,
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:23.120]   and some of you guys who are good at drawing,
[00:22:23.120 --> 00:22:25.720]   you would have probably a split screen,
[00:22:25.720 --> 00:22:29.680]   the top, Jesus, God on his throne, being worshiped,
[00:22:29.680 --> 00:22:33.360]   and then everything underneath on fire, right?
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.520]   Disease, famine, and all kinds of chaos
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:36.520]   happening underneath.
[00:22:36.520 --> 00:22:38.080]   And so, basically, he's saying,
[00:22:38.080 --> 00:22:41.960]   work for this and not this, right?
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.240]   In summary, that's what it is.
[00:22:43.240 --> 00:22:46.280]   He said, look at what he has shown us.
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:48.720]   Why will we work so hard for things
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:53.020]   that's gonna burn and die and blow up and fade?
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.880]   Look at eternity, even in the midst of all this chaos.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:57.080]   Look at the beauty of heaven.
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:22:59.560]   Look at where God's throne is.
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:00.720]   He said, work for this.
[00:23:00.720 --> 00:23:03.080]   That's the point, is to give us a sense of urgency
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:06.360]   and imprint a picture in our head
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:08.620]   of what it is that we are coveting,
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.280]   that where this is headed, right?
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:12.020]   So that we can live holy lives.
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:19.280]   John, again, this is kind of like
[00:23:19.280 --> 00:23:20.480]   parenthetical, what's happening.
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:24.660]   John bows down when he hears this revelation.
[00:23:24.660 --> 00:23:28.860]   Again, in chapter 19, 10, he's reiterating what happened.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.160]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:36.900]   Was John confused that he was not supposed
[00:23:36.900 --> 00:23:38.180]   to worship an angel?
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:40.400]   Did he think that the angel was God?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:42.100]   You think that's why he worshiped?
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:47.100]   Then why did he worship?
[00:23:47.100 --> 00:23:48.660]   I mean, this is Apostle John.
[00:23:49.620 --> 00:23:53.260]   I mean, this is one of the apostles of God.
[00:23:53.260 --> 00:23:56.980]   And clearly, it's not Jesus speaking to him.
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:57.980]   It's an angel.
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:23:59.060]   He says it's an angel.
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:03.580]   So what causes, man, it would be blasphemous
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:05.380]   for him to bow down and worship.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.860]   Why did he do that?
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:12.700]   Did he all of a sudden become an idol worshiper?
[00:24:12.700 --> 00:24:15.740]   You understand my question?
[00:24:15.740 --> 00:24:18.980]   Shouldn't he have known better
[00:24:18.980 --> 00:24:20.700]   than to have instinctively bowed down
[00:24:20.700 --> 00:24:22.300]   and begin to worship this angel?
[00:24:22.300 --> 00:24:28.720]   I think, again, this is just my opinion.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:32.580]   I think it wasn't because obviously John was confused
[00:24:32.580 --> 00:24:36.140]   that maybe this was God and maybe he needed to be worshipped.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:41.140]   I think worship is instinctive, naturally, for all of us.
[00:24:41.140 --> 00:24:44.900]   Like, we worship without knowing that we are worshiping.
[00:24:44.900 --> 00:24:46.780]   Right?
[00:24:47.780 --> 00:24:51.460]   We know better that we should worship God and God alone.
[00:24:51.460 --> 00:24:52.660]   That's the first commandment.
[00:24:52.660 --> 00:24:54.380]   I shall have no other God before me.
[00:24:54.380 --> 00:24:58.420]   I shall make no graven images of me, right?
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:00.220]   We know, and that's commanded by God.
[00:25:00.220 --> 00:25:02.100]   That's Christianity 101.
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:04.420]   And yet, we instinctively worship
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.380]   whenever our hearts pull us towards something,
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:10.000]   when we're confronted with something magnificent,
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:11.060]   whatever that may be.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:13.340]   It could be sports.
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:14.180]   It could be money.
[00:25:14.180 --> 00:25:16.460]   It could be the opposite sex.
[00:25:17.500 --> 00:25:18.380]   It could be money.
[00:25:18.380 --> 00:25:22.660]   Whatever it may be, we bow down and worship instinctively
[00:25:22.660 --> 00:25:25.020]   because God created us to be worshippers.
[00:25:25.020 --> 00:25:27.340]   Our problem is not that we worship.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:29.180]   It's that we worship what's wrong.
[00:25:29.180 --> 00:25:30.940]   Right?
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.120]   So I don't think John thought this out.
[00:25:33.120 --> 00:25:34.260]   I don't think John was confused.
[00:25:34.260 --> 00:25:36.600]   I think he was just doing something instinctive
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.980]   because all this fantastic revelation
[00:25:38.980 --> 00:25:41.020]   was coming through this angel
[00:25:41.020 --> 00:25:46.020]   that he just instinctively, oh my gosh, and just worshipped.
[00:25:46.140 --> 00:25:47.700]   And obviously, the angel had to stop him
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:49.820]   because that's blasphemous, right?
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.060]   The reason why, again, I wanted to take a minute
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:56.100]   to even point that out is because I think
[00:25:56.100 --> 00:25:59.660]   what John does here is something that we do instinctively
[00:25:59.660 --> 00:26:02.380]   without knowing all the time.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:06.060]   We just don't have an angel rebuking us.
[00:26:06.060 --> 00:26:09.140]   We have the word of God rebuking us.
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:10.300]   We don't have an angel stopping us.
[00:26:10.300 --> 00:26:13.260]   Hey, hey, stop, stop worshiping that, right?
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:17.100]   Imagine if the angel was standing before us
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.180]   and stopped and rebuked you every time
[00:26:19.180 --> 00:26:23.500]   you instinctively bowed to worship something, right?
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:27.340]   'Cause I think this scene happens in our life all the time.
[00:26:27.340 --> 00:26:29.820]   It's just that we don't recognize it, right?
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:35.860]   John is commanded not to seal up the prophecies of the book,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:39.980]   basically meaning it wasn't meant for him alone.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.580]   It was meant to be shared, right?
[00:26:43.580 --> 00:26:46.300]   God didn't share this with John so that John can come back
[00:26:46.300 --> 00:26:50.020]   and say, "I have something that you guys don't have," right?
[00:26:50.020 --> 00:26:57.100]   So this prophecy, and obviously,
[00:26:57.100 --> 00:26:59.180]   it's more than just simply this prophecy,
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:00.540]   but when God gives us the word,
[00:27:00.540 --> 00:27:04.020]   every single time that you are taught the word of God,
[00:27:04.020 --> 00:27:07.620]   you're responsible for that, right?
[00:27:07.620 --> 00:27:08.460]   You're responsible for that.
[00:27:08.460 --> 00:27:10.220]   That's what it says in the book of Ezekiel,
[00:27:10.300 --> 00:27:12.820]   that every single one of us have been called to be watchmen.
[00:27:12.820 --> 00:27:16.300]   If you go and tell or warn a sinner from his ways
[00:27:16.300 --> 00:27:19.100]   and he does not turn, his blood is not on you.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.060]   But if I tell you to tell the sinner
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:21.900]   and you do not tell them,
[00:27:21.900 --> 00:27:23.780]   and they do not turn from their sin,
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:26.340]   not only are they guilty, but you are also guilty
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:28.580]   for the revelation that you received.
[00:27:28.580 --> 00:27:33.580]   So when the angel tells John, "Do not shut up this prophecy,"
[00:27:33.580 --> 00:27:35.780]   it basically is saying, "Now you're responsible.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:40.500]   I showed it to you so that you can tell other people."
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.900]   The fact that you and I have the word of God,
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:43.780]   we're responsible.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:45.180]   We're responsible to ourselves,
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:48.700]   and we're responsible for the people who are around us,
[00:27:48.700 --> 00:27:50.220]   to a certain degree.
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:52.420]   Ultimately, God is the one in charge,
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.740]   but every revelation that we receive
[00:27:54.740 --> 00:27:57.020]   is meant to be shared, right?
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:28:03.980]   Now, he says something strange here in verse 11,
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:07.780]   and I hope you guys were perplexed by it.
[00:28:07.780 --> 00:28:11.500]   In verse 11, it says, "Let the evil doer still do evil,
[00:28:11.500 --> 00:28:12.940]   and the filthy still be filthy,
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:14.620]   and the righteous still do right,
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.460]   and the holy still be holy."
[00:28:17.460 --> 00:28:18.700]   What does that mean?
[00:28:18.700 --> 00:28:20.660]   Is he basically saying, "I've given you all of these things,
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:23.460]   but just kinda, quesara, sera, let them do whatever"?
[00:28:23.460 --> 00:28:29.060]   Did you ask that when you were reading this?
[00:28:29.060 --> 00:28:29.980]   What does this mean?
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:31.060]   What is God saying?
[00:28:34.060 --> 00:28:36.860]   He is not telling them not to repent.
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:41.220]   The whole book of Revelation was a call to repentance, right?
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:44.300]   For the church to be sober, to non-Christians to see,
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.020]   for us to share.
[00:28:46.020 --> 00:28:48.940]   The whole point of this is to bring people to repentance.
[00:28:48.940 --> 00:28:51.940]   He's not telling them not to repent,
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:54.740]   but that the revelation will speed along
[00:28:54.740 --> 00:28:56.940]   in whichever direction you are already headed.
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:59.180]   In fact, the scripture tells us that, right?
[00:29:01.220 --> 00:29:04.740]   In Matthew 24, 38 to 39, it said,
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:06.540]   "When will the end time come?
[00:29:06.540 --> 00:29:09.220]   When they are acting like it's like any other day."
[00:29:09.220 --> 00:29:11.920]   In other words, they're not gonna be paying attention.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:18.020]   In Revelation 6, 15 to 16, it clearly says that,
[00:29:18.020 --> 00:29:20.660]   "Even when Christ comes, they're not gonna repent."
[00:29:20.660 --> 00:29:26.340]   Then, their unrepentance is going to mean judgment.
[00:29:29.740 --> 00:29:32.140]   I'll come back to that, let me go to the verses.
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:35.140]   Oops, I guess I don't have the verses.
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:42.900]   So, he's not saying, "Just let them, let them just go.
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:44.220]   I mean, I don't really care about them."
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:47.540]   But he is basically saying that, "Don't listen."
[00:29:47.540 --> 00:29:49.740]   So, if you are righteous,
[00:29:49.740 --> 00:29:53.020]   you ought to be more righteous, right?
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.700]   Those who are wicked are gonna continue to be wicked, right?
[00:29:57.660 --> 00:29:59.980]   And he, basically, that's what he says
[00:29:59.980 --> 00:30:02.700]   when he talks about hardening the heart of Pharaoh.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:04.300]   Remember, we went over that?
[00:30:04.300 --> 00:30:09.300]   That he's not going after somebody who's repentant,
[00:30:09.300 --> 00:30:11.220]   but those who are already headed that way,
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.420]   God kind of gives them over to that, right?
[00:30:14.420 --> 00:30:20.900]   So, in other words, this is really a call to who?
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.300]   To the church.
[00:30:23.300 --> 00:30:26.900]   So, if you remember, who was this letter written to?
[00:30:27.900 --> 00:30:31.220]   To seven churches, right?
[00:30:31.220 --> 00:30:34.660]   In fact, every letter in the Bible is written to Christians.
[00:30:34.660 --> 00:30:38.780]   Every letter in the Bible is written to Christians.
[00:30:38.780 --> 00:30:41.460]   If the Holy Spirit doesn't open your eyes,
[00:30:41.460 --> 00:30:44.540]   it's not gonna make any sense to you anyway, right?
[00:30:44.540 --> 00:30:46.900]   So, everything that was written in here
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:48.940]   for the Christians to read and take heed,
[00:30:48.940 --> 00:30:51.220]   and even the warning that he gives of judgments,
[00:30:51.220 --> 00:30:53.500]   is that given to non-Christians or Christians?
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:57.500]   Christians are the ones reading it.
[00:30:57.500 --> 00:30:58.700]   This was not written and then say,
[00:30:58.700 --> 00:31:00.940]   hey, go and pass it out to the non-Christians.
[00:31:00.940 --> 00:31:03.580]   Make a little pamphlets of this passage
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:06.220]   and pass it out to the non-Christians.
[00:31:06.220 --> 00:31:10.420]   Even the warning of judgment is given to the church, right?
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:12.460]   For what purpose?
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:14.940]   To keep us sober, right?
[00:31:14.940 --> 00:31:17.500]   Paul says, "I buffet my body, make him my slave.
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:20.020]   "Let's pass me after I have preached others
[00:31:20.020 --> 00:31:21.420]   "that I may be disqualified."
[00:31:21.420 --> 00:31:22.740]   Who is he writing that to?
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.580]   To Christians, he's writing that to Christians.
[00:31:26.580 --> 00:31:29.020]   Hebrews chapter 10, when he talks about
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.140]   it's a fearful thing to fall into the hands of a holy God,
[00:31:33.140 --> 00:31:34.380]   who's he writing that to?
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:37.860]   Christians, right?
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:39.540]   So, the point of all of this,
[00:31:39.540 --> 00:31:44.540]   even this horrific revelation in the book of Revelation,
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:48.460]   is for the Christians to be sober.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:51.380]   Those who the Holy Spirit is already indwelling in you
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:53.180]   and pulling you toward God,
[00:31:53.180 --> 00:31:56.460]   that there will be a sense of urgency in our walk with God,
[00:31:56.460 --> 00:32:00.700]   that we don't just be satisfied with information,
[00:32:00.700 --> 00:32:02.780]   but it would move us toward obedience.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:08.220]   He said, "His coming means the alpha and omega."
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:12.500]   As you guys know, alpha is the beginning,
[00:32:12.500 --> 00:32:16.860]   omega is the end, and so it's fitting
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:21.380]   that the very last prophecy given to us
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:23.820]   in the book of Revelation reminds us
[00:32:23.820 --> 00:32:25.540]   that he is the alpha and the omega.
[00:32:25.540 --> 00:32:27.540]   So, we are at the omega part of it.
[00:32:27.540 --> 00:32:29.700]   Everything that God has revealed,
[00:32:29.700 --> 00:32:32.980]   creation and their fall and the recreation
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:34.540]   is being finalized here.
[00:32:34.540 --> 00:32:37.380]   So, when Christ comes, he's going to bring the end.
[00:32:37.380 --> 00:32:41.140]   He's the beginning, and so we've been taught
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.060]   all throughout the book that he's the beginning.
[00:32:43.060 --> 00:32:45.180]   All things were created by him and for him
[00:32:45.180 --> 00:32:46.620]   and sustained through him,
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:49.780]   and now all things will end in him.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.460]   Right?
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:54.020]   "Those who have been washed in the robe
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:56.620]   "will have access to the tree of life," verse 14.
[00:32:56.620 --> 00:32:59.780]   "Blessed are those who wash their robes
[00:32:59.780 --> 00:33:01.860]   "so that they may have the right to the tree of life
[00:33:01.860 --> 00:33:04.780]   "and that they may enter the city by the gate."
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:12.540]   Can somebody turn your Bible to Genesis 3.22?
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.700]   I don't think I have that here.
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:17.900]   No, I don't have it here.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:21.140]   Somebody up front, read it out loud for 22 and 23.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:28.820]   Somebody?
[00:33:28.820 --> 00:33:31.340]   Okay.
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:34.260]   - There's a Lord, there's a Lord.
[00:33:34.260 --> 00:33:35.100]   - Go ahead.
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.340]   - There's a Lord God that told man
[00:33:37.340 --> 00:33:40.300]   that he's come like one of us, and no one does.
[00:33:40.300 --> 00:33:42.020]   And I love him, he's got his hands
[00:33:42.020 --> 00:33:44.860]   and he's also the tree of life, and he's in the bread.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:46.620]   There's a Lord God that told man
[00:33:46.620 --> 00:33:47.940]   that he's in the bread.
[00:33:47.940 --> 00:33:50.860]   There's a Lord God sent out and brought his people
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:52.980]   to work and to grasp the holy truth.
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:56.380]   - Okay, so you notice that one of the punishments
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:59.260]   that they receive was that they,
[00:33:59.260 --> 00:34:03.660]   God blocked the access to the tree of life.
[00:34:03.660 --> 00:34:06.580]   The reason why is because sin entered into them.
[00:34:06.580 --> 00:34:09.620]   So in other words, if they eat of that tree,
[00:34:09.620 --> 00:34:12.540]   they're gonna be in that sinful state for eternity.
[00:34:12.540 --> 00:34:13.980]   So God blocks them from that.
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:15.380]   Now when they go to heaven,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.740]   God opens the access to the tree of life, right?
[00:34:19.740 --> 00:34:21.180]   Because we're no longer in sin.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:22.820]   Sin has been washed away,
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:24.660]   and because we have been sanctified
[00:34:24.660 --> 00:34:27.220]   in our glorified, resurrected body,
[00:34:27.220 --> 00:34:29.780]   now he opens the access that was closed in Genesis,
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:32.340]   now will be opened in heaven, okay?
[00:34:32.340 --> 00:34:36.580]   So we're coming full circle, right?
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:40.720]   What was lost in Genesis is being restored
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.220]   in Revelation at the end.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:46.700]   And those who have not repented,
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:49.700]   he said, they will be left outside, verse 15.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:53.620]   Outside are the dogs and their sorcerers
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:55.900]   and the sexually immoral and murderers and idolaters
[00:34:55.900 --> 00:34:58.260]   and everyone who loves and practices falsehood.
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:08.980]   So his coming means the root of the descendants of David,
[00:35:08.980 --> 00:35:12.700]   the bright and morning star is coming, right?
[00:35:12.700 --> 00:35:15.460]   Meaning the root of the descendants of David
[00:35:15.460 --> 00:35:17.860]   mean all the things that were prophesied
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:20.980]   in the Old Testament is being fulfilled in Christ, right?
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:22.540]   He is coming.
[00:35:22.540 --> 00:35:24.660]   Remember his first coming,
[00:35:24.660 --> 00:35:27.180]   they were all excited because the root of David was coming.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:30.740]   He was the fulfilled Messiah in the line of Judah.
[00:35:30.740 --> 00:35:35.740]   But he didn't come for ultimate restoration.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:39.500]   He came to take away our sins, right?
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:41.620]   So they were disappointed and they crucified him
[00:35:41.620 --> 00:35:43.580]   because he didn't fit,
[00:35:43.580 --> 00:35:46.340]   even though he fit in every other way,
[00:35:46.340 --> 00:35:47.940]   but him going to the cross didn't fit
[00:35:47.940 --> 00:35:49.620]   and that's why they rejected him.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.740]   But when he says he's gonna,
[00:35:50.740 --> 00:35:53.660]   now this root of David is gonna come
[00:35:53.660 --> 00:35:55.260]   is that now he's gonna come and fulfill
[00:35:55.260 --> 00:35:57.620]   what they were expecting or hoping,
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:59.980]   the final restoration is gonna happen in Christ.
[00:35:59.980 --> 00:36:02.780]   So when he comes, all of that is gonna come with him.
[00:36:02.780 --> 00:36:05.780]   And he's called the bright and morning star.
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:08.860]   Who is also called the morning star in the Bible?
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:12.980]   (audience murmuring)
[00:36:12.980 --> 00:36:16.580]   I heard it, I heard hissing, hissing sound.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:19.780]   So I'm assuming that you got it, right?
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:24.140]   Satan, Satan is called the morning star in Isaiah.
[00:36:24.140 --> 00:36:26.500]   Remember that when we were studying through Isaiah?
[00:36:26.500 --> 00:36:28.860]   Right, Isaiah 14, 12?
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:30.260]   I think I have that verse.
[00:36:30.260 --> 00:36:34.260]   Yeah.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.540]   How you are fallen from heaven,
[00:36:36.540 --> 00:36:39.820]   O day star, son of dawn.
[00:36:39.820 --> 00:36:41.420]   How you are cut down to the ground,
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:43.700]   you who laid the nations low.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:45.740]   In some of your translations,
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:47.620]   I think the NIV, it says morning star.
[00:36:47.620 --> 00:36:54.420]   So obviously the question is going to be,
[00:36:54.420 --> 00:36:58.980]   why is Jesus and Satan described as a morning star?
[00:36:58.980 --> 00:37:01.380]   Right, Jesus is called the morning star.
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:05.660]   In Revelation 2.28 and 2 Peter 1.19, okay?
[00:37:05.660 --> 00:37:08.500]   That part right there, I think you're,
[00:37:08.500 --> 00:37:12.660]   right here, your paper has 1 Peter,
[00:37:12.660 --> 00:37:14.500]   so you're gonna have to correct that.
[00:37:14.500 --> 00:37:16.300]   I caught it too late after we printed it,
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.460]   so change that to 2 Peter, okay?
[00:37:19.460 --> 00:37:22.140]   In those two verses, it talks about how God will give us
[00:37:22.140 --> 00:37:24.500]   as a reward the morning star.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:28.980]   So many people understand that as Christ as the reward.
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:33.940]   So Satan and Christ is called the morning star.
[00:37:34.940 --> 00:37:37.940]   This is a description of Jesus, not a title.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:41.780]   Okay.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:44.340]   So you're kind of like, well,
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:47.060]   Jesus is called the morning star,
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:49.580]   Satan is called the morning star.
[00:37:49.580 --> 00:37:51.260]   What is the significance of that?
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:38:00.500]   You know what's also interesting?
[00:38:02.740 --> 00:38:06.140]   What does Jesus refer to in the early part of Revelation?
[00:38:06.140 --> 00:38:07.100]   It's chapter five.
[00:38:07.100 --> 00:38:08.940]   What animals?
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:15.260]   What animal?
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:18.340]   Lion of Judah, right?
[00:38:18.340 --> 00:38:20.020]   The lion of Judah is gonna come,
[00:38:20.020 --> 00:38:22.940]   and then he turn around, they see the lamb, like slain.
[00:38:22.940 --> 00:38:25.340]   So Jesus is called the lion of Judah.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.380]   Who else is called the lion in the Bible?
[00:38:27.380 --> 00:38:31.060]   Satan, do you remember what passage?
[00:38:32.060 --> 00:38:35.260]   First Peter 5.8, we have an adversary, the devil,
[00:38:35.260 --> 00:38:37.860]   who roars around like a lion,
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:39.980]   seeking someone to devour, right?
[00:38:39.980 --> 00:38:46.260]   So, you know, the Mormons teach
[00:38:46.260 --> 00:38:49.900]   that Jesus and Satan are brothers, right?
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:51.340]   And they take obscure passages
[00:38:51.340 --> 00:38:52.580]   and they just kind of link it together.
[00:38:52.580 --> 00:38:55.380]   Clearly, that's not the teaching of the Bible.
[00:38:55.380 --> 00:38:59.380]   Nowhere does it say that Satan is the brother of God.
[00:38:59.380 --> 00:39:02.420]   No where does it say they're brothers, right?
[00:39:02.420 --> 00:39:05.500]   But there are descriptions that sound similar.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.700]   And part of the thing is, again,
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:11.420]   again, this is not a title, but a description.
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:14.380]   A morning star, meaning the early morning
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:16.620]   when you see a star, it's bright.
[00:39:16.620 --> 00:39:19.300]   So the idea of it is it's the brightest star
[00:39:19.300 --> 00:39:21.820]   when you wake up in the morning and see something.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:24.700]   And so basically, it's a description
[00:39:24.700 --> 00:39:25.980]   of something spectacular.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:28.700]   And so in Isaiah, when it describes Satan,
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.780]   it's describing something that was created beautiful
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:34.060]   that fell, right?
[00:39:34.060 --> 00:39:37.860]   God intended Satan to shine,
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:39.780]   and instead of shining for God,
[00:39:39.780 --> 00:39:42.380]   he wanted to shine for himself, right?
[00:39:42.380 --> 00:39:47.060]   Where Christ, he is the morning star,
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.860]   and he does exactly the opposite, right?
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.180]   Where he says he was equal with God,
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:54.700]   but he did not consider equality with God
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:57.780]   something to regress, and he does exactly the opposite.
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:58.620]   Right?
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.620]   And so Satan's path, in some sense,
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:06.260]   they had similar, right, similar standing
[00:40:06.260 --> 00:40:08.820]   as far as his incarnation is concerned.
[00:40:08.820 --> 00:40:13.740]   And Satan uses the gift of God to glorify himself,
[00:40:13.740 --> 00:40:16.180]   and as a result of that, condemnation
[00:40:16.180 --> 00:40:17.500]   and the fall of mankind.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   Christ is, in his incarnation,
[00:40:20.500 --> 00:40:24.020]   he's the morning star, and instead,
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.980]   he gives that up and he humbles himself, becomes nothing,
[00:40:26.980 --> 00:40:29.780]   and as a result of that, salvation of mankind
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:33.660]   and restoration of the sinful world, right?
[00:40:33.660 --> 00:40:37.060]   So in some sense, Christ, that's why he said,
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:40.620]   "Look, Christ," and you have the Antichrist, right?
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.900]   Because the Antichrist, remember when we were studying
[00:40:42.900 --> 00:40:46.340]   through Revelation, the Antichrist, what does he do?
[00:40:46.340 --> 00:40:51.740]   What is his activity, just in a large scale?
[00:40:51.740 --> 00:40:56.100]   Remember, he was mimicking Christ, right?
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:57.580]   He was mimicking Christ.
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:01.540]   And so Christ comes, and he reverses the curse.
[00:41:01.540 --> 00:41:05.860]   The curse was Satan seeking glory,
[00:41:05.860 --> 00:41:08.420]   and as a result, downfall of mankind.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.300]   Christ comes, he shuns glory,
[00:41:12.300 --> 00:41:14.820]   and the reversal of the curse, right?
[00:41:14.820 --> 00:41:17.580]   So you kind of see that larger picture,
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:20.820]   where Satan is trying to take advantage of his gift
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:24.540]   to climb up to God, where Christ humbles himself,
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:26.180]   and then he tells us to do the same,
[00:41:26.180 --> 00:41:28.620]   and then he restores mankind, right?
[00:41:28.620 --> 00:41:31.580]   So again, so it is not without purpose
[00:41:31.580 --> 00:41:33.660]   that these statements are referring to Christ
[00:41:33.660 --> 00:41:35.340]   and Satan at the same time,
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:40.340]   but again, used exactly the opposite, right?
[00:41:40.340 --> 00:41:42.580]   To restore what Satan ruined.
[00:41:42.580 --> 00:41:52.500]   These are passages that I've already mentioned.
[00:41:52.500 --> 00:41:55.260]   (pages rustling)
[00:41:55.260 --> 00:41:56.100]   Oops.
[00:41:56.100 --> 00:42:01.100]   So this revelation of his coming
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:05.620]   should cause us to long for his coming, 17 and 20, right?
[00:42:05.620 --> 00:42:09.900]   The spirit said of the bride, and the bride say,
[00:42:09.900 --> 00:42:13.460]   come and let the one who hears say, come,
[00:42:13.460 --> 00:42:15.260]   and let the one who is thirsty come.
[00:42:15.260 --> 00:42:19.140]   Let the one who desires take the water of life without price.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:23.980]   So the spirit, right, is the Holy Spirit,
[00:42:23.980 --> 00:42:25.020]   and who is the bride?
[00:42:25.020 --> 00:42:29.940]   That's us, the church, right?
[00:42:29.940 --> 00:42:31.620]   And the ESV is capitalized,
[00:42:31.620 --> 00:42:33.700]   but I think other translations, it's not capitalized,
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:37.060]   but basically, the Holy Spirit in us is crying out.
[00:42:37.060 --> 00:42:40.140]   So in Romans 8, 26, remember what it says, Romans 8, 26?
[00:42:40.140 --> 00:42:42.060]   The Holy Spirit intercedes on our behalf,
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.380]   groaning with words that we cannot understand.
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.580]   So it's praying and interceding on our behalf.
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:47.980]   What do you think the Holy Spirit
[00:42:47.980 --> 00:42:50.300]   is groaning and interceding on our behalf for?
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:58.500]   Probably this, to bring us to God, right?
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:03.980]   And so the spirit and the church is groaning, come.
[00:43:03.980 --> 00:43:09.020]   So in the total conclusion of all of this
[00:43:09.020 --> 00:43:11.740]   is the revelation of his second coming
[00:43:11.740 --> 00:43:15.060]   is to cause us to long for his coming.
[00:43:15.060 --> 00:43:17.620]   Again, in verse 20, he would testify to these things,
[00:43:17.620 --> 00:43:21.780]   surely I am coming soon, amen, come Lord Jesus, right?
[00:43:21.780 --> 00:43:26.460]   So if you've been paying attention and studying diligently
[00:43:26.460 --> 00:43:27.900]   and memorizing your verses
[00:43:27.900 --> 00:43:31.860]   and taking the time to really examine these things,
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:34.900]   the goal of this, again, is for obedience,
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.820]   but it's to create a longing inside of us
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.060]   to desire for his coming.
[00:43:39.060 --> 00:43:43.660]   So again, like it says in 2 Peter, to long to look, right?
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:47.060]   If we are eagerly expecting him to come,
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:50.820]   what kind of people should we be, right?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:53.540]   In other words, longing for him, longing for him to come.
[00:43:53.540 --> 00:43:57.060]   Instead of longing for vacation,
[00:43:57.060 --> 00:43:59.220]   longing for a better job, longing for a better house,
[00:43:59.220 --> 00:44:00.820]   to long for his coming,
[00:44:00.820 --> 00:44:05.380]   knowing that the reward is not your vacation, right?
[00:44:05.380 --> 00:44:10.300]   Reward isn't whatever it is that this world can offer.
[00:44:10.300 --> 00:44:13.760]   Christian's ultimate reward is gonna come when he comes,
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:15.220]   right?
[00:44:15.220 --> 00:44:17.700]   So the end conclusion of all this, one,
[00:44:17.700 --> 00:44:19.860]   is to create a longing for him.
[00:44:19.860 --> 00:44:23.540]   And then secondly, the revelation of Jesus' coming
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:26.080]   should cause us to come to him.
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:29.300]   Not only for Jesus to come, but for us to go to him.
[00:44:29.300 --> 00:44:32.180]   So again, in verse 17, it says,
[00:44:32.180 --> 00:44:34.860]   "Come and let the one who is thirsty come.
[00:44:34.860 --> 00:44:36.740]   "Let the one who desires take the water of life
[00:44:36.740 --> 00:44:38.300]   "without price."
[00:44:38.300 --> 00:44:41.660]   So it is to create a longing for his coming,
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:43.000]   and then it is for us to actively,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.420]   not to just simply want him to come,
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:48.540]   but for us to actively go to him, right?
[00:44:48.540 --> 00:44:52.980]   That our thirsting would be to him,
[00:44:52.980 --> 00:44:54.420]   to be satisfied in him.
[00:44:54.420 --> 00:44:57.780]   Now,
[00:44:57.780 --> 00:45:03.120]   he, okay, let me finish this
[00:45:03.120 --> 00:45:06.460]   before I get to the discussion questions.
[00:45:06.460 --> 00:45:08.340]   He wraps it up in verse 18 and 19,
[00:45:08.340 --> 00:45:11.540]   warning about adding or taking away, right?
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:14.240]   From this prophecy, or else there will be plagues
[00:45:14.240 --> 00:45:16.000]   and severe judgment for him.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:20.100]   That their consequence is eternal judgment, right?
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.120]   In other words, God's word is an extension of who he is.
[00:45:24.120 --> 00:45:27.500]   So if you take away or add from this,
[00:45:27.500 --> 00:45:30.260]   he says there will be severe judgment that's gonna come.
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:34.540]   Now, okay, having said all that,
[00:45:34.540 --> 00:45:36.280]   let me just conclude with this.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:40.960]   The point of all of this is ultimately,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:43.900]   is to love Christ, right?
[00:45:43.900 --> 00:45:45.420]   Long for his coming,
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:50.420]   and for us to hunger and thirst for his righteousness.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.900]   And I was thinking about this this week.
[00:45:52.900 --> 00:45:58.520]   How you can love the church without loving Christ.
[00:45:58.520 --> 00:46:01.980]   And it's easy, very easy.
[00:46:01.980 --> 00:46:08.340]   Well, if you feel loved at church, you love Christ, right?
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.040]   And if you don't feel loved at church,
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:10.900]   you don't love Christ.
[00:46:10.900 --> 00:46:12.540]   And how much of our walk with God
[00:46:12.540 --> 00:46:15.700]   is contingent upon who we're surrounded by,
[00:46:15.700 --> 00:46:17.980]   and what circumstance we're in.
[00:46:17.980 --> 00:46:20.180]   So when we take a step back, we have to ask ourselves,
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:23.340]   if that's the pattern of our walk with God,
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.140]   are we loyal to Christ, or are we loyal to the church?
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:30.500]   If we're loyal to Christ,
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:36.340]   then that should lead us to be loyal to the church, right?
[00:46:36.340 --> 00:46:37.780]   But in that order.
[00:46:39.300 --> 00:46:40.980]   But being loyal to the church
[00:46:40.980 --> 00:46:43.340]   doesn't equal being loyal to Christ.
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.980]   It's not the same thing.
[00:46:46.980 --> 00:46:52.020]   And that's the confusion,
[00:46:52.020 --> 00:46:54.660]   that we can be so easily deceived,
[00:46:54.660 --> 00:47:00.500]   because we can be so surrounded by cultural Christianity,
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:05.460]   and just assume that there's an affection for Christ
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:08.620]   because of your affection for your brother and sister.
[00:47:08.620 --> 00:47:10.260]   He said, you can't love God
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:11.520]   without loving your brother and sister,
[00:47:11.520 --> 00:47:13.340]   but you can easily love your brother and sister
[00:47:13.340 --> 00:47:14.340]   without loving God.
[00:47:14.340 --> 00:47:17.440]   And that's where the confusion lies,
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:21.140]   and that's where you have all kinds of false faith
[00:47:21.140 --> 00:47:24.920]   in the church, where we can feel safe
[00:47:24.920 --> 00:47:26.260]   thinking that we have genuine faith,
[00:47:26.260 --> 00:47:30.180]   when what's really driving you is the friendships.
[00:47:30.180 --> 00:47:33.300]   The friendships around you.
[00:47:33.300 --> 00:47:38.380]   So the challenge for us is to seek out real faith,
[00:47:38.380 --> 00:47:39.780]   real affection for Christ,
[00:47:39.780 --> 00:47:41.740]   'cause ultimately, he says,
[00:47:41.740 --> 00:47:44.900]   when you are thirsty, where do you go?
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:52.460]   Do you look for friends, counselors, your pastors?
[00:47:52.460 --> 00:47:54.620]   Or is Christ the one that you turn to?
[00:47:54.620 --> 00:47:59.200]   So you should decide to love the church
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:00.600]   because you love Christ,
[00:48:00.600 --> 00:48:04.420]   but not the other way, right?
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.020]   Not the other way.
[00:48:06.020 --> 00:48:07.100]   And I was just thinking about that.
[00:48:07.100 --> 00:48:12.100]   If your loyalty to the church is greater
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.580]   than your loyalty to Christ,
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:16.500]   sometimes it'll keep you at a church
[00:48:16.500 --> 00:48:20.460]   that you shouldn't be at, right?
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:23.140]   And sometimes it'll cause you to leave a church
[00:48:23.140 --> 00:48:27.480]   that you should be at, if you understand what I'm saying.
[00:48:27.480 --> 00:48:32.140]   Our loyalty to Christ must be the central thing
[00:48:32.140 --> 00:48:35.540]   that causes us to do what we do.
[00:48:35.540 --> 00:48:38.020]   So the whole point of this revelation
[00:48:38.020 --> 00:48:40.660]   is to create a longing for his second coming
[00:48:40.660 --> 00:48:44.180]   and for us to go to him, to Christ.
[00:48:44.180 --> 00:48:45.660]   When you see the beauty of Christ,
[00:48:45.660 --> 00:48:47.460]   when you see the sacrifice and his mercy,
[00:48:47.460 --> 00:48:49.660]   when you see his holiness and justice,
[00:48:49.660 --> 00:48:53.980]   does that create a longing for you to be with him
[00:48:53.980 --> 00:48:55.580]   more than with your friends?
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:49:01.460]   If you were the only Christian among your friends,
[00:49:01.460 --> 00:49:03.960]   would you still be as passionate about your faith?
[00:49:04.920 --> 00:49:05.760]   Right?
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.480]   And if other confessing Christians are not as passionate,
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:15.320]   would you be the one who stands out in that group
[00:49:15.320 --> 00:49:17.360]   because of your loyalty to Christ first?
[00:49:17.360 --> 00:49:22.840]   The danger for all of us is we all have a tendency
[00:49:22.840 --> 00:49:25.520]   to be sheep, we move when everybody else moves
[00:49:25.520 --> 00:49:27.840]   and we stop when everybody else stops.
[00:49:27.840 --> 00:49:30.000]   And it's always dangerous.
[00:49:30.000 --> 00:49:32.440]   There's reasons why whenever men of God,
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:34.400]   before they are anointed to go preach,
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:37.880]   they take them out to the desert to be isolated with God.
[00:49:37.880 --> 00:49:42.120]   And that's why our personal time of devotion
[00:49:42.120 --> 00:49:44.960]   was just you and God is so important
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   because if you don't have a personal relationship with God,
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:49.680]   just between you and God,
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:52.920]   you are relying on your corporate relationship.
[00:49:52.920 --> 00:49:57.240]   Corporate relationship meaning you know him in a crowd,
[00:49:57.240 --> 00:49:59.360]   but you don't know him personally.
[00:49:59.360 --> 00:50:02.800]   So when his name is blasphemed, it doesn't bother you
[00:50:02.800 --> 00:50:05.200]   because it's not personal.
[00:50:05.200 --> 00:50:07.280]   Right?
[00:50:07.280 --> 00:50:10.680]   If anything should be personal, that should be personal.
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:13.360]   Christ's name, the one who loved me and saved me
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.840]   and died for me, the one I'm longing for,
[00:50:15.840 --> 00:50:18.420]   the one that knows me better than anybody else,
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.380]   the one who knows my tears, my pain, my hurt
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:23.520]   that nobody else knows about but him,
[00:50:23.520 --> 00:50:26.280]   the one who understands me more than anybody else,
[00:50:26.280 --> 00:50:28.280]   who created my inner being,
[00:50:28.280 --> 00:50:31.200]   who knew me before I ever even knew of him.
[00:50:31.200 --> 00:50:35.440]   If there's anybody that we should be loyal to is to Christ.
[00:50:35.440 --> 00:50:39.800]   But if we have a corporate relationship with him,
[00:50:39.800 --> 00:50:41.080]   it's just corporate, it's just,
[00:50:41.080 --> 00:50:44.560]   it's just where our emotions are detached.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:48.680]   And so again, as we wrap up the study,
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:51.360]   our, you know, again, not my words, but his words,
[00:50:51.360 --> 00:50:55.300]   ultimately is that Lord, come, come, save us.
[00:50:56.160 --> 00:50:59.640]   Save us from this fallen world, save us from ourselves.
[00:50:59.640 --> 00:51:01.680]   And if you are thirsty and you're hungry,
[00:51:01.680 --> 00:51:05.520]   you're lonely, you're dejected, and you're lacking wisdom,
[00:51:05.520 --> 00:51:08.080]   let him ask of God, right?
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:11.080]   Come to Christ, right?
[00:51:11.080 --> 00:51:13.840]   Don't come to church, come to Christ.
[00:51:13.840 --> 00:51:17.240]   Don't come to worship, come to meet Christ, right?
[00:51:17.240 --> 00:51:20.600]   You can come to church five minutes late,
[00:51:20.600 --> 00:51:22.800]   10 minutes late, every other, every Sunday,
[00:51:22.880 --> 00:51:27.120]   and just say, I went to church, right?
[00:51:27.120 --> 00:51:28.320]   You could just, you could just,
[00:51:28.320 --> 00:51:30.640]   as long as you attended, you feel like you worship.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:32.760]   But if you're coming to worship Christ,
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:34.480]   our attitude should be different.
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.200]   Shouldn't it be different, right?
[00:51:37.200 --> 00:51:40.040]   You shouldn't be okay with what's acceptable here.
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.560]   You shouldn't be okay
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:44.520]   because everybody else is okay with it.
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:49.440]   If you're coming to Christ, Christ should be your focus.
[00:51:49.440 --> 00:51:51.120]   Christ should be the one you're coming to meet.
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:53.120]   Christ is the one that you need to talk to
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.320]   before you talk to anybody else, okay?
[00:51:56.320 --> 00:51:58.400]   Again, this is nothing new to you,
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:02.760]   but it's at the core of who we are.
[00:52:02.760 --> 00:52:05.240]   If we miss this, you can be at church all your life,
[00:52:05.240 --> 00:52:06.720]   and I know I'm a broken record
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.120]   for saying this over and over again,
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:12.560]   but we live in a post-Christian culture.
[00:52:12.560 --> 00:52:15.600]   Remember that, post-Christian culture.
[00:52:15.600 --> 00:52:18.320]   There's remnants of Christianity all around us,
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.120]   but it is not Christianity.
[00:52:21.040 --> 00:52:23.920]   True Christianity is in here, okay?
[00:52:23.920 --> 00:52:29.440]   Let me leave you with some discussion questions.
[00:52:29.440 --> 00:52:32.840]   Before I do that, because next week is,
[00:52:32.840 --> 00:52:36.200]   you guys have the study questions, right?
[00:52:36.200 --> 00:52:39.600]   Study question basically is review, okay?
[00:52:39.600 --> 00:52:40.800]   So the first question is,
[00:52:40.800 --> 00:52:44.160]   know the general outline of the 22 books.
[00:52:44.160 --> 00:52:47.360]   So if you studied it throughout,
[00:52:47.360 --> 00:52:49.440]   you don't need to know every single detail,
[00:52:49.440 --> 00:52:51.360]   but kinda know when I say chapter five
[00:52:51.360 --> 00:52:52.640]   or chapter six, chapter seven,
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:55.680]   because it's broken down by the different plagues.
[00:52:55.680 --> 00:52:56.920]   So I think it's pretty easy
[00:52:56.920 --> 00:52:58.960]   until you get to about chapter 14,
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:02.000]   and then from there, there's like a parenthetical,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   three chapters, and then we get into the last part.
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.080]   So just see if you can memorize as much as you can.
[00:53:07.080 --> 00:53:09.600]   So if I said chapter 19,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:11.960]   that you know what that is referenced to, okay?
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:13.800]   But, and the rest of it
[00:53:13.800 --> 00:53:15.680]   is more of a personal, applicational question,
[00:53:15.680 --> 00:53:18.760]   so I encourage you guys to take some time to study that.
[00:53:19.760 --> 00:53:21.840]   In what way has Jesus fulfilled his promise
[00:53:21.840 --> 00:53:23.280]   of the living water to you?
[00:53:23.280 --> 00:53:25.160]   Are you completely satisfied in him?
[00:53:25.160 --> 00:53:26.960]   Is that an accurate description
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:29.120]   of who you are at this point?
[00:53:29.120 --> 00:53:31.680]   Or is the U2 song,
[00:53:31.680 --> 00:53:35.040]   I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For, right?
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:36.240]   Yeah, I don't know if you know that song.
[00:53:36.240 --> 00:53:39.640]   If you know that song, you know what I'm talking about.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:43.280]   If you don't, just Google it, right?
[00:53:43.280 --> 00:53:46.040]   Basically, he talks about how his chains were broken
[00:53:46.040 --> 00:53:47.200]   and his sins were forgiven,
[00:53:47.200 --> 00:53:49.400]   and then he says, but I still haven't found
[00:53:49.400 --> 00:53:50.560]   what I'm looking for.
[00:53:50.560 --> 00:53:51.400]   Is that you?
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:54.360]   Right, you're around the promises,
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:56.120]   and he's like, I should be, but you're not.
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.360]   Is that your honest answer, right?
[00:53:58.360 --> 00:54:01.040]   So if it is, what is it?
[00:54:01.040 --> 00:54:03.120]   Number two, if Jesus was to come tomorrow,
[00:54:03.120 --> 00:54:05.160]   what is the first thing that you will do?
[00:54:05.160 --> 00:54:09.240]   What prevents you from doing that now?
[00:54:09.240 --> 00:54:12.880]   So take some time to discuss that.
[00:54:12.880 --> 00:54:14.160]   Number three, what practical way
[00:54:14.160 --> 00:54:15.720]   can you live your Christian life
[00:54:15.720 --> 00:54:18.200]   more sober and aware of his second coming?
[00:54:18.200 --> 00:54:23.560]   Paul actively shared the second coming of Christ
[00:54:23.560 --> 00:54:26.840]   when sharing the gospel, 2 Thessalonians 2, 5, and on.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:29.520]   John is told not to steal up what he has shown
[00:54:29.520 --> 00:54:32.160]   and told, what role should the end times play
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.200]   in sharing the gospel today?
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.560]   Okay, so again, those are pretty straightforward questions,
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:38.920]   so take some time to discuss with your small group.
[00:54:38.920 --> 00:54:41.160]   Next Sunday is gonna be a wrap-up study,
[00:54:41.160 --> 00:54:44.560]   so it's gonna look a little bit different than this week.
[00:54:44.560 --> 00:54:47.760]   We may have, we may, we haven't decided yet,
[00:54:47.760 --> 00:54:52.040]   we're trying to see if we can possibly have dinner,
[00:54:52.040 --> 00:54:54.920]   and we might have you guys eat while we're going over,
[00:54:54.920 --> 00:54:57.840]   and we may do it in a format that's a little bit different
[00:54:57.840 --> 00:55:00.280]   because we're reviewing, but we'll let you know
[00:55:00.280 --> 00:55:01.640]   by the end of this week, okay?
[00:55:01.640 --> 00:55:03.400]   Let me pray for us, and then I'll dismiss you
[00:55:03.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   to your small group.
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:11.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your word
[00:55:11.400 --> 00:55:13.400]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:16.080]   We thank you for loving us.
[00:55:16.080 --> 00:55:23.160]   Lord, as we strive, Lord God, or desire to strive toward you,
[00:55:23.160 --> 00:55:28.520]   we are so easily entangled, so easily amused,
[00:55:28.520 --> 00:55:33.080]   so easily given to worship of trivial things.
[00:55:33.080 --> 00:55:37.400]   I pray, Father God, that the picture and the vision
[00:55:37.400 --> 00:55:39.200]   that you've shown us through this book
[00:55:39.200 --> 00:55:42.200]   will be permanent in our salvation.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:43.800]   Will be permanent in our psyche,
[00:55:43.800 --> 00:55:45.800]   in our spirit, in our souls.
[00:55:45.800 --> 00:55:48.760]   That even as we wrestle,
[00:55:48.760 --> 00:55:52.440]   that we would have a clear picture of the end times.
[00:55:52.440 --> 00:55:56.160]   That all of these things are foolish,
[00:55:56.160 --> 00:55:58.880]   and they will all wither away.
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:02.720]   And to know, Father, that we will be in heaven.
[00:56:02.720 --> 00:56:07.320]   We would be like the tree planted by the streams of water,
[00:56:07.320 --> 00:56:11.440]   where our leaf does not wither,
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:13.160]   will constantly be in fruit.
[00:56:13.160 --> 00:56:17.640]   No more tears, no more death, no more pain.
[00:56:17.640 --> 00:56:21.480]   We won't be separated from our loved ones.
[00:56:21.480 --> 00:56:25.520]   I pray, Father God, that that vision would consume
[00:56:25.520 --> 00:56:30.520]   our hearts, cause great joy and hope in our lives,
[00:56:30.520 --> 00:56:34.040]   and greater compassion, Father God,
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:36.000]   for those who do not yet know you.
[00:56:36.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   I pray in our small groups that you would help us along
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.080]   in our discussion, help us to be open and honest,
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:46.840]   and in our weakness, that we would find strength in you.
[00:56:46.840 --> 00:56:48.560]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
