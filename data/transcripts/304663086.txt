[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.560]   If you could turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 16, we're going to be wrapping up
[00:00:08.560 --> 00:00:12.240]   the book of Romans in the next four or five months.
[00:00:12.240 --> 00:00:13.240]   Verses 25.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:18.320]   We're going to study three words at a time.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:20.520]   So verse 25 through verse 27.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:24.280]   So we're going to be wrapping up this week and then next week, and then we're going to
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:28.440]   be taking a short break from the systematic study, and we're going to be jumping into
[00:00:28.440 --> 00:00:32.220]   the book of Hebrews, probably after we come back from India.
[00:00:32.220 --> 00:00:34.520]   So it's going to be probably early February.
[00:00:34.520 --> 00:00:40.160]   And again, if there's just to kind of give you a plug, you know, Hebrews is a book that
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:42.340]   kind of connects the Old Testament with the New Testament.
[00:00:42.340 --> 00:00:47.680]   And since we've just studied the book of Leviticus, and it will be a tremendous help for us to
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:51.480]   see how that is applied and fulfilled in Christ in the book of Hebrews.
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.560]   So we're going to start that in in February, but we're going to be wrapping this up and
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:59.360]   preparing ourselves for Christmas season after this.
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:01.960]   So verse 25 to 27.
[00:01:01.960 --> 00:01:07.520]   Now to him who is able to establish you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ,
[00:01:07.520 --> 00:01:12.240]   according to the revelation of the mystery which has been kept secret for long ages past,
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:15.680]   but now is manifested and by the scriptures of the prophets, according to the commandment
[00:01:15.680 --> 00:01:20.600]   of the eternal life has been made known to all the nations, leading to obedience of faith
[00:01:20.600 --> 00:01:23.960]   to the only wise God through Jesus Christ be glory forever.
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:24.960]   Amen.
[00:01:24.960 --> 00:01:25.960]   Let's pray.
[00:01:25.960 --> 00:01:33.120]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you.
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:35.500]   Thank you for your love.
[00:01:35.500 --> 00:01:41.480]   We thank you, Father God, for opening our eyes to see that you are real.
[00:01:41.480 --> 00:01:48.120]   We thank you, Father God, for allowing us and causing us to put our trust in you.
[00:01:48.120 --> 00:01:55.880]   I pray, Father, that your living water is what we are coming and continue to seek.
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:58.480]   Lord God, help us to drink from it.
[00:01:58.480 --> 00:02:03.720]   Help us to be satisfied, Lord God, with the bread of Christ.
[00:02:03.720 --> 00:02:08.440]   We ask that our communion service, Lord, would be honorable to you and that Christ's name
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:10.680]   and what he has done may be exalted as a result.
[00:02:10.680 --> 00:02:13.000]   We thank you in Jesus name we pray.
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   Amen.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   All right.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:19.380]   So, as you guys know, we've been in the book of Romans for about three and a half years.
[00:02:19.380 --> 00:02:23.720]   If you looked at some of the questions that I posted up yesterday on Facebook, I asked
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:28.360]   you to go and look at Romans chapter 1, 1 through 17 and compare it with the way that
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:30.120]   he's ending.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:34.040]   And the reason why I asked you to do that is because Paul basically is ending the letter
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.560]   in the same manner that he started.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.700]   So, you know, most of Paul's letters are written systematically.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:40.700]   He has a point.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.400]   This is the reason why I'm writing it.
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:46.360]   And then he has maybe, you know, four or five points he wants to make and then he concludes.
[00:02:46.360 --> 00:02:47.840]   And Romans is no different.
[00:02:47.840 --> 00:02:51.920]   Even though it's a long letter and it's been three and a half years since we started the
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:55.960]   letter, if you look at the beginning of the letter, he kind of outlines that this is what
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:57.720]   he's going to say.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:02.740]   And then at the end of it, you have very similar things that he says and then he kind of concludes
[00:03:02.740 --> 00:03:04.840]   it summarizing what he just said.
[00:03:04.840 --> 00:03:09.560]   So, if you look at it, if you took a look at it, you'll see that Paul begins Romans
[00:03:09.560 --> 00:03:15.160]   chapter 1 through 17 about how the gospel is the power of God, how through the prophets
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:19.420]   and the holy scriptures he made the gospel known, how he was going to bring the obedience
[00:03:19.420 --> 00:03:21.500]   of faith through the gospel.
[00:03:21.500 --> 00:03:26.720]   And as a result of that, the gospel is to be proclaimed and then ultimately it establishes
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:27.720]   God's glory.
[00:03:27.720 --> 00:03:31.720]   And so you'll see all the themes that are mentioned in chapter 1 repeated here in these
[00:03:31.720 --> 00:03:34.400]   three verses.
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:38.760]   What I want to do for the next couple of weeks is go through the list that I've just mentioned
[00:03:38.760 --> 00:03:43.120]   that is repeated here, these five things that he says about the gospel.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.680]   So today I'm going to be looking at the first two and then next week we'll be looking at
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:49.200]   the last three and then we'll conclude.
[00:03:49.200 --> 00:03:53.840]   The first thing he's talking about, the gospel is the outworking of God's power.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.520]   The gospel is Jesus.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:57.360]   The gospel is the mystery revealed.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:02.160]   The gospel is the mystery to be preached and the gospel is the mystery to be obeyed.
[00:04:02.160 --> 00:04:04.640]   So the last three we'll be dealing with next week.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:07.700]   First two we'll be dealing with today.
[00:04:07.700 --> 00:04:12.280]   This part that we're looking at, the theologians typically call that a doxology.
[00:04:12.280 --> 00:04:19.160]   And what doxology basically is a short theological statement that is set in repetition or maybe
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:23.240]   a concise form because it was important enough for the early church to memorize.
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.720]   So a doxology oftentimes you'll find it in hymns.
[00:04:26.720 --> 00:04:30.280]   You'll find the exact same wording in other letters and it's repeated.
[00:04:30.280 --> 00:04:34.640]   So the reason why we know that it's a doxology is because we know these phrases are used
[00:04:34.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   repeatedly all throughout the New Testament.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:43.520]   In other words, it is a condensed version of theology.
[00:04:43.520 --> 00:04:46.580]   So every part of what he says, he says meaningfully.
[00:04:46.580 --> 00:04:50.080]   Not that any other part of Book of Romans, anything else he says, he says randomly.
[00:04:50.080 --> 00:04:58.480]   But in particular, this part of it was probably put to memory and maybe even sung in certain
[00:04:58.480 --> 00:04:59.480]   circles.
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.480]   Kind of like, you know, when we first go to school, everybody learned their ABCs through
[00:05:03.480 --> 00:05:05.040]   the ABC song.
[00:05:05.040 --> 00:05:08.360]   A, B, C, D, E, F, G.
[00:05:08.360 --> 00:05:11.480]   So if you don't know how to sing that song, you don't speak English.
[00:05:11.480 --> 00:05:12.480]   Right?
[00:05:12.480 --> 00:05:18.080]   So everybody who speaks English, at some point in your education system, you learn the ABCs
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:19.840]   through those songs.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.120]   If you've ever learned Greek, we did the same thing.
[00:05:23.120 --> 00:05:26.440]   Our professors and I realized it wasn't unique to our school.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:30.240]   And everybody that I talked to who learned Greek learned the Greek song.
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:37.120]   Alpha, beta, gamma, delta, epsilon, beta, eta, theta, una, kappa, lambda, minute, c,
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.120]   omicron, pi, rho, sigma, ti, epsilon, p, q, c, omega.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:43.120]   That's what we learned.
[00:05:43.120 --> 00:05:47.320]   So I learned that everybody who learned Greek, at least most people that I know that learned
[00:05:47.320 --> 00:05:49.160]   Greek, also learned that.
[00:05:49.160 --> 00:05:51.080]   Because by putting it in that form, I still remember.
[00:05:51.080 --> 00:05:53.440]   I have bad memory, but I still remember it because of that.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.120]   So the doxology is written in that form.
[00:05:57.120 --> 00:05:59.480]   It's written because every part of this is significant.
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:04.160]   And that's why it's important for us to take our time to dissect and remember.
[00:06:04.160 --> 00:06:08.600]   This is kind of a repetition or a summary of what Paul was saying throughout the whole
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   16 chapters.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:19.040]   First and most important part of the gospel that Paul was talking about is that God is
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:22.120]   at the center of this gospel.
[00:06:22.120 --> 00:06:29.560]   The first thing that we need to learn, one, that gospel is the outworking of God's power.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:35.860]   We can study all about what he has done and the intricacies of that atonement and sacrifice,
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:40.720]   but behind all of that, it is a revelation of who God is.
[00:06:40.720 --> 00:06:43.940]   And that was the whole point of the revelation of the Old Testament and the New Testament
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:45.020]   and the gospel.
[00:06:45.020 --> 00:06:50.200]   If you learn all the secrets about what it means to be saved, what Christ accomplished
[00:06:50.200 --> 00:06:55.240]   on the cross, and at the end result of that, you don't have a clear vision of who God is.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:57.640]   You've missed the whole point.
[00:06:57.640 --> 00:07:01.080]   First and foremost, we need to recognize that the gospel is the power of God.
[00:07:01.080 --> 00:07:06.560]   Romans chapter 1, verse 16, it says, "I am not ashamed of the gospel, for it is the power
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:07.560]   of God for salvation."
[00:07:07.560 --> 00:07:12.480]   "For it is the power of God for salvation."
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:16.200]   Think about when we think about the power of God, there's a whole bunch of things that
[00:07:16.200 --> 00:07:18.320]   we can refer to.
[00:07:18.320 --> 00:07:22.520]   His very creation in the beginning, it was a demonstration of God's power.
[00:07:22.520 --> 00:07:28.480]   All that you and I know about the universe, it says, by his words, he says, "Let it be,"
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:29.480]   and it happened.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:34.800]   I mean, if that isn't the demonstration of God's power, I don't know what is.
[00:07:34.800 --> 00:07:41.120]   All throughout redemptive history, we see God delivering the nation of Israel from the
[00:07:41.120 --> 00:07:46.800]   superpower of the Egyptians through these 10 plagues, these miracles.
[00:07:46.800 --> 00:07:48.120]   God demonstrated his power.
[00:07:48.120 --> 00:07:50.800]   Even the superpower couldn't do anything against him.
[00:07:50.800 --> 00:07:55.920]   As they were escaping, they run into a body of water and he just splits it and causes
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:07:57.680]   them to walk through.
[00:07:57.680 --> 00:08:02.680]   There are periods when we see God stopping the sun for a period.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:07.440]   So when we think about the power of God, there's all kinds of things that we can choose from.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:13.920]   And even in Jesus' ministry, he walks on water, he calms a storm, he catches fish, you know,
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:16.040]   and he feeds the 5,000, miraculously.
[00:08:16.040 --> 00:08:20.760]   So we can think of all types of things that Jesus himself has done to demonstrate his
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:26.800]   power, and yet in Romans 1:16, he says, "It is the gospel that is the power of God for
[00:08:26.800 --> 00:08:29.340]   salvation."
[00:08:29.340 --> 00:08:34.240]   We know that in the book of Matthew 9, and I refer to this passage quite a bit because
[00:08:34.240 --> 00:08:38.360]   when I understood what Jesus was saying and all that was attached to this passage, it
[00:08:38.360 --> 00:08:40.700]   was paradigm shifting for me.
[00:08:40.700 --> 00:08:46.780]   In Matthew 9, 2-5, that's a passage where the paralytics are taken in front of Jesus,
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:48.960]   hoping that Jesus would heal him.
[00:08:48.960 --> 00:08:52.940]   So they rip open the house, they drop him below because there's too many people in the
[00:08:52.940 --> 00:08:58.180]   room, and then this is what Jesus says, "And they brought to him a paralytic lying in a
[00:08:58.180 --> 00:09:03.700]   bed, seeing their faith, Jesus said to the paralytic, 'Take courage, son, your sins are
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:04.700]   forgiven.'"
[00:09:04.700 --> 00:09:07.880]   Now, you have to put yourself in their shoes.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:10.420]   That's not why they lowered him.
[00:09:10.420 --> 00:09:11.740]   That was not their problem.
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:13.460]   At least that wasn't their perception.
[00:09:13.460 --> 00:09:21.360]   Their problem was they had a friend, a brother or son that couldn't walk.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:24.660]   So what problem could have been bigger than that?
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:25.660]   He couldn't walk.
[00:09:25.660 --> 00:09:30.100]   If he couldn't walk, I mean, we're not talking about a period of time when there's all kinds
[00:09:30.100 --> 00:09:31.620]   of help that's coming from the government.
[00:09:31.620 --> 00:09:37.860]   If you couldn't physically walk, you were basically forced to be out on the street and
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:41.660]   beg, and oftentimes they equate it with some sort of spiritual sin.
[00:09:41.660 --> 00:09:46.260]   Maybe you or your parents or ancestor did something and you must have deserved this.
[00:09:46.260 --> 00:09:48.960]   So they didn't really receive much compassion.
[00:09:48.960 --> 00:09:53.820]   So you can understand why they went through all that trouble to put him in front of Jesus,
[00:09:53.820 --> 00:10:00.680]   hoping that he would heal him, and instead Jesus says, "Take courage, your sins are forgiven."
[00:10:00.680 --> 00:10:03.560]   Some of the scribes said to themselves, "This fellow blasphemes.
[00:10:03.560 --> 00:10:06.200]   How dare he say this?
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:11.660]   We know that you have power to heal, so if you heal him, it's great.
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:14.660]   But how dare you say your sins are forgiven?"
[00:10:14.660 --> 00:10:19.860]   Jesus knowing this, in verse 4, their thoughts and said, "Why are you thinking evil in your
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:21.400]   hearts?
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:26.960]   Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or say, 'Get up and walk.'"
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:30.100]   Think about who it is that we are talking about.
[00:10:30.100 --> 00:10:32.800]   The scripture says all things were made by him and for him.
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:37.340]   Not only did he create all things, all things are sustained because of him.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:41.260]   The very reason why we have enough breath is because Jesus is allowing it.
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:43.900]   So think about the context.
[00:10:43.900 --> 00:10:48.500]   When he asked this question, "Which is easier to say, 'Get up and walk,' or say, 'Your
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:49.560]   sins are forgiven?'"
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:55.020]   For Jesus, I mean, what would it take for him to just heal this man?
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.020]   Get up?
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.340]   That's all it would take.
[00:10:58.340 --> 00:10:59.380]   Just get up.
[00:10:59.380 --> 00:11:00.380]   Get up and walk.
[00:11:00.380 --> 00:11:01.620]   And that's exactly what he did.
[00:11:01.620 --> 00:11:04.620]   He had blind people and just touched them and he would get healed.
[00:11:04.620 --> 00:11:10.180]   He had a woman who was hemorrhaging for years and all she did was reach out to him and then
[00:11:10.180 --> 00:11:11.980]   she was healed.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:17.820]   A lame man who couldn't walk and all he did was pick him up and then he is healed.
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:25.660]   So for Jesus to heal this man, all it took for him was to just say the word.
[00:11:25.660 --> 00:11:37.940]   He asked, "Which is easier, to say, 'Get up,' or to say, 'Your sins are forgiven?'"
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:44.260]   Humanly speaking, when we think of the power of God, we don't necessarily think about
[00:11:44.260 --> 00:11:48.220]   the gospel and what he has accomplished and what we already have in Christ.
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:53.420]   In fact, you and I are constantly looking for evidence of his power.
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:56.900]   We want him to answer our prayer, we want something miraculous to happen, or we have
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:00.860]   disasters happen and we're praying for God to supernaturally stop and demonstrate his
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:01.860]   power.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:09.100]   But the scripture says the primary demonstration of his power was the gospel.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:13.300]   You have to understand what it meant for him to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:22.180]   That the God of the universe became nothing, humiliated, was crucified on the cross, resurrected
[00:12:22.180 --> 00:12:29.620]   by absorbing sins of all upon himself.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:36.260]   You have any idea, and I'm sure some of you do, how difficult it is to not to strike somebody
[00:12:36.260 --> 00:12:38.460]   back when they hit you?
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:42.880]   I don't know if you've ever experienced that.
[00:12:42.880 --> 00:12:48.140]   Or maybe even slandered you, how hard it is to just not to say anything when somebody
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:49.620]   slanders you.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:53.540]   So when the scripture says, "Turn to your other cheek," I mean, that's not human.
[00:12:53.540 --> 00:12:55.900]   What human being does that?
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.300]   They'll think you're crazy if somebody hits you and you turn to your other cheek.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:05.940]   I remember years back, Pastor Peter Chong, he took a group of pastors and we went out
[00:13:05.940 --> 00:13:08.420]   to the Philippines in a poor area.
[00:13:08.420 --> 00:13:12.260]   And when I came back, I shared this story with the church before.
[00:13:12.260 --> 00:13:17.840]   But I remember very vividly being in the elevator with this old man.
[00:13:17.840 --> 00:13:23.020]   And we noticed after about two days at this nice fancy hotel that we were at, a lot of
[00:13:23.020 --> 00:13:28.540]   12, 13, 14 year old, 15 year old young girls running around.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:34.100]   And what was interesting was they were all connected to some old man.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.520]   Probably in their 60s.
[00:13:36.520 --> 00:13:39.180]   And they were just having fun and the girls were there.
[00:13:39.180 --> 00:13:42.900]   And you could tell that they didn't want to be there, but they were there because that's
[00:13:42.900 --> 00:13:44.020]   the way they were going to make money.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:48.260]   So there was sex trafficking that was happening right in front of us.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.080]   And once we realized what was going on, obviously we were disgusted.
[00:13:52.080 --> 00:13:55.980]   And even as we were eating, we could see them in the corners coming in and out of the restaurants
[00:13:55.980 --> 00:13:57.220]   where we were at.
[00:13:57.220 --> 00:14:02.980]   And one day, about five of us were headed up to our rooms and that guy and a young girl
[00:14:02.980 --> 00:14:04.260]   walked into the elevator.
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:07.660]   And the elevator could fit maybe about 15 and there was about six of us and then two
[00:14:07.660 --> 00:14:08.660]   of them.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.580]   And we were all guys.
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.560]   Some of the guys in the room were pretty big guys, are in the elevator.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.100]   And we knew exactly what was going on.
[00:14:17.100 --> 00:14:20.860]   This guy was taking advantage of this young girl because he has money.
[00:14:20.860 --> 00:14:23.100]   And he was knee braided, he was having fun.
[00:14:23.100 --> 00:14:26.740]   Then he turned around, looked at us and said, "Hey, you guys want to join us?
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:28.220]   We're going to have a party, we're going to have fun."
[00:14:28.220 --> 00:14:31.100]   You could tell the awkwardness in that girl in that elevator.
[00:14:31.100 --> 00:14:37.100]   And the whole time, all of us were looking at each other, just restraining ourselves.
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:42.580]   Because we were just one second away from just grabbing this guy.
[00:14:42.580 --> 00:14:46.220]   And every single one of us, we knew exactly what we were thinking.
[00:14:46.220 --> 00:14:48.660]   Because I have a daughter that age.
[00:14:48.660 --> 00:14:54.580]   I mean, our natural instinct was to grab him and just choke him.
[00:14:54.580 --> 00:14:57.540]   And we would have felt good about it.
[00:14:57.540 --> 00:15:02.380]   And we were just holding back, understanding that that wasn't going to fix the problem.
[00:15:02.380 --> 00:15:03.380]   And we're all pastors.
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:07.380]   Wouldn't it be a good testimony?
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:08.380]   Come back, say, "How was Philippines?"
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:12.700]   "Oh, beat up a guy in an elevator."
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:15.300]   So we strained ourselves and then he walked out.
[00:15:15.300 --> 00:15:19.140]   And as soon as he walked out, we all just kind of sigh of relief.
[00:15:19.140 --> 00:15:21.100]   And we were just, "Oh my gosh."
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:24.260]   And we knew exactly what everyone was thinking.
[00:15:24.260 --> 00:15:30.140]   We were so disgusted to be in that elevator with this person.
[00:15:30.140 --> 00:15:37.580]   Imagine the restraint of our God.
[00:15:37.580 --> 00:15:48.140]   Seeing his son being brutalized by the very people that he came to die for.
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.900]   Watching him getting beaten and then mocked and then nailed on the cross.
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:16:00.620]   All the while the Father is planning to come and put their sins upon him.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:09.820]   What power, what restraint did God show for not coming and just whack and just be done
[00:16:09.820 --> 00:16:12.060]   with it?
[00:16:12.060 --> 00:16:16.500]   I know I promised Noah that I would not destroy the world in this way.
[00:16:16.500 --> 00:16:20.340]   But I'm God.
[00:16:20.340 --> 00:16:27.380]   How many times do I need to forgive these people before they listen?
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:35.860]   When we think about the power of God, we think of trivial things in the light of who he is.
[00:16:35.860 --> 00:16:43.540]   But in order for him to restrain himself from just squashing us, from finishing this earth,
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.380]   just destroying the universe and say, "You know what?
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:46.700]   Let's just start over."
[00:16:46.700 --> 00:16:47.700]   Why not?
[00:16:47.700 --> 00:16:52.780]   Because they surely don't deserve it.
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:59.700]   How much power and restraint that he must have shown not to simply end it then.
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:06.020]   But not only did he not end it, he purposed it.
[00:17:06.020 --> 00:17:13.900]   He drew near to his son and he placed their sins, my sins, upon the son and raises him
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:19.380]   up from the dead and then he reverses the curse.
[00:17:19.380 --> 00:17:23.700]   And the curse is not reversed for people who are going to live the rest of eternity saying,
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.660]   "Thank God.
[00:17:25.660 --> 00:17:31.220]   You and I received this salvation by his power and we're constantly forgetting what we have
[00:17:31.220 --> 00:17:32.220]   in Christ."
[00:17:32.220 --> 00:17:38.180]   So it wasn't that, "Well, he saved us and then wow, the great reward for our God is
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.540]   like we're worshiping for eternity."
[00:17:39.540 --> 00:17:41.100]   All that is true.
[00:17:41.100 --> 00:17:46.500]   But meanwhile, we're constantly, constantly forgetting what he has done.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.620]   And that's whose sin he died for, mine and yours.
[00:17:52.620 --> 00:18:00.060]   So when the Bible says that he is able, the greatest demonstration of God's power is in
[00:18:00.060 --> 00:18:02.820]   the gospel.
[00:18:02.820 --> 00:18:07.940]   We're constantly looking for trivial things, some magical tricks for God to show who he
[00:18:07.940 --> 00:18:09.540]   is.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:14.940]   But beyond the cross, everything else is trivial if you really understand what happened.
[00:18:14.940 --> 00:18:20.180]   In 2 Corinthians 9, 8, not only does he save us, the Bible says that he is able to sustain
[00:18:20.180 --> 00:18:21.180]   us.
[00:18:21.180 --> 00:18:23.860]   He didn't just start this and then save us and say, "You know what?
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:26.180]   Rest of it is up to you."
[00:18:26.180 --> 00:18:31.900]   In 2 Corinthians 9, 8, it says, "And God is able to make all grace abound to you so
[00:18:31.900 --> 00:18:38.020]   that always having all sufficiency in everything, you may have an abundance for every good deed."
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:47.980]   How often do we waste time wondering, "Only if, only if God would give me this, only if
[00:18:47.980 --> 00:18:53.700]   he would answer my prayer in that, then I would have sufficiency."
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:58.500]   The scripture says, "God is able to make all grace abound to you."
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:19:04.420]   Any Christian who genuinely believes what it is that he has in Christ and has genuinely
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:12.980]   met him and is living day to day in want, either has severely forgotten who it is that
[00:19:12.980 --> 00:19:17.660]   he worships or he does not believe.
[00:19:17.660 --> 00:19:22.420]   A Christian can never come before God and say, "God, I am the way I am because you
[00:19:22.420 --> 00:19:24.060]   didn't give me this."
[00:19:24.060 --> 00:19:29.100]   He says, "God is able to make all grace abound to you so that always having all sufficiency
[00:19:29.100 --> 00:19:35.420]   in everything," just in case we missed it, "everything that we need is sufficiently
[00:19:35.420 --> 00:19:37.700]   found in God and God alone."
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.700]   See, what we lack isn't resources.
[00:19:43.700 --> 00:19:45.460]   What we lack isn't money.
[00:19:45.460 --> 00:19:46.660]   It's not organization.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:49.220]   It's not people.
[00:19:49.220 --> 00:19:55.540]   What we lack is faith to recognize what it is that we have in God already.
[00:19:55.540 --> 00:20:03.820]   What we lack is faith because if God is the God that we truly believe, then all the resources,
[00:20:03.820 --> 00:20:07.020]   everything that you and I could possibly imagine is found in him.
[00:20:07.020 --> 00:20:14.260]   The reason why we are living day to day in want is because we lack faith to believe that.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:20.100]   Ephesians 3, 16-20 says that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory,
[00:20:20.100 --> 00:20:24.780]   to be strengthened with power through his Spirit in the inner man.
[00:20:24.780 --> 00:20:29.140]   We're always looking for external things to answer our questions.
[00:20:29.140 --> 00:20:34.820]   We're always looking for circumstances, for people, for opportunities.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:40.460]   He says, "No, I'm praying that your inner man be strengthened so that Christ may dwell
[00:20:40.460 --> 00:20:45.460]   in your hearts through faith."
[00:20:45.460 --> 00:20:52.020]   If you believe, again Ephesians 1-3 describing about what God has done, if you believe that,
[00:20:52.020 --> 00:20:55.140]   through faith you have access to that.
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:59.820]   If you believe in a God who predestined you, elected you, pursued you, and you believe
[00:20:59.820 --> 00:21:05.700]   in that love, if you believe that, you will be strengthened.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:09.820]   That you being rooted and grounded in love may be able to comprehend with all the saints
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:13.860]   what is the breadth and length and height and depth and know the love of Christ which
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:16.380]   surpasses knowledge.
[00:21:16.380 --> 00:21:20.260]   Any kind of knowledge or study or pursuit, he says, it surpasses all of that, that you
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:24.260]   may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[00:21:24.260 --> 00:21:27.100]   Fullness of God is found where?
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.100]   Believing in God.
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:33.580]   "Now to him who is able to do far abundantly beyond all that we ask or think according
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:37.980]   to the power that works within us."
[00:21:37.980 --> 00:21:38.980]   We've been given.
[00:21:38.980 --> 00:21:39.980]   God is able.
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:42.260]   He is able.
[00:21:42.260 --> 00:21:49.300]   If he is able, why do we live our lives in want, constantly thinking only if?
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:56.900]   If I just had this, if we just tweaked that, if I just worked harder, if I just did this.
[00:21:56.900 --> 00:22:00.060]   If you've been raised in the church and you've been a Christian for a while, if we ask the
[00:22:00.060 --> 00:22:03.100]   question, "Do you believe?"
[00:22:03.100 --> 00:22:06.620]   The obvious answer to that knee-jerk reaction is, "Of course I believe.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:10.020]   I was baptized so many years ago.
[00:22:10.020 --> 00:22:11.380]   I was raised in the church.
[00:22:11.380 --> 00:22:15.940]   I've never been an atheist, so of course I believe."
[00:22:15.940 --> 00:22:21.020]   But the fundamental question about the gospel is that very question.
[00:22:21.020 --> 00:22:22.020]   Do you believe?
[00:22:22.020 --> 00:22:26.340]   Now, we can say, "Of course I believe.
[00:22:26.340 --> 00:22:27.340]   I believe in God.
[00:22:27.340 --> 00:22:29.420]   I've never been an atheist."
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:32.660]   But that's not the question.
[00:22:32.660 --> 00:22:35.940]   The question is much more profound than that.
[00:22:35.940 --> 00:22:39.740]   The question is not, "Do you believe that God exists?"
[00:22:39.740 --> 00:22:44.060]   But do you believe that he is able?
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.020]   Do you believe that he is able?
[00:22:47.020 --> 00:22:52.440]   That he is able to forgive your sins and that he is able to sustain you until glorification?
[00:22:52.440 --> 00:22:56.140]   Do you believe that he is able or do you think your boss is able?
[00:22:56.140 --> 00:22:58.380]   Do you think your job is able?
[00:22:58.380 --> 00:23:00.420]   Do you think your friends are able?
[00:23:00.420 --> 00:23:02.340]   Do you think the church is able?
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:05.380]   Where have you put your confidence outside of God?
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:14.420]   So the fundamental question in our walk with God is, "Do you believe that he is able?"
[00:23:14.420 --> 00:23:18.700]   Before we make a knee-jerk reaction and say, "Of course we believe."
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:21.020]   But do you believe that God of the Bible?
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:25.380]   Do you believe that God of the gospel?
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:29.940]   Paul says in 2 Timothy 1.12, "For this reason I also suffer these things, but I am not ashamed,
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:36.540]   for I know whom I have believed, and I am convinced that he is able to guard what I
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:39.340]   have entrusted to him until that day."
[00:23:39.340 --> 00:23:43.060]   Paul has been beaten, he's sitting in prison, possibly waiting for a death sentence, and
[00:23:43.060 --> 00:23:46.340]   he says, "I rejoice.
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:50.420]   I know whom I have believed, and I know he is able to guard whatever it is I've given
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   him."
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:55.340]   So his confidence did not come from Timothy.
[00:23:55.340 --> 00:23:56.540]   His confidence didn't come from Timothy.
[00:23:56.540 --> 00:24:04.300]   Timothy was a, humanly speaking, young, inexperienced, timid, weak guy.
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:05.700]   That's not where his confidence was coming from.
[00:24:05.700 --> 00:24:11.140]   He says, "I'm confident that what I've entrusted to him, if you entrust it to him, he is able
[00:24:11.140 --> 00:24:12.140]   to guard it.
[00:24:12.140 --> 00:24:13.140]   He is able to guard it."
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:17.660]   He says the same thing in Philippians 1.6, "For I am confident of this very thing, that
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:25.540]   he who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus."
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:29.180]   Philippians was a great model church, but he says the confidence is not with the Philippians.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:35.100]   He says, "I am confident that he who began a good work, he will carry it unto completion
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:36.540]   on the day of Christ."
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:38.220]   Because it is his work.
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:43.620]   He begins it, he sustains it, and he's the one who ends it.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:49.180]   That's why, again, this benediction, this doxology in Jude 24, 25, "Now to him who is
[00:24:49.180 --> 00:24:53.740]   able to keep you from stumbling, and to make you stand in the presence of his glory, blameless
[00:24:53.740 --> 00:24:55.400]   with great joy.
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:58.740]   To the only God, our Savior, through Jesus Christ, our Lord, be glory, majesty, dominion,
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.700]   authority before all time and now and forever."
[00:25:00.700 --> 00:25:08.620]   Again, in this doxology, "Now to him who is able to keep you from stumbling."
[00:25:08.620 --> 00:25:10.660]   Is he able?
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.620]   Think about where our grumblings come.
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:20.500]   Our grumblings come because we don't believe there's an answer.
[00:25:20.500 --> 00:25:23.740]   So our faith is not in God.
[00:25:23.740 --> 00:25:26.760]   And we have to ask ourselves that.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.280]   We want you, we want them, we want this, we want those things to change.
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.600]   But if we believe he's able, why do we not go to him first?
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:40.960]   Why do we seek counselors and friends and small groups and accountability?
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:47.360]   Why do we seek all of these things first before we go to the God who is able?
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:53.300]   The whole purpose of all of these things are simply a conduit to get us to God.
[00:25:53.300 --> 00:25:57.580]   The whole purpose of worship and the whole purpose of fellowship is simply to point us
[00:25:57.580 --> 00:25:58.580]   to God.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:01.160]   It is not the final destination.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:02.380]   He is able.
[00:26:02.380 --> 00:26:07.560]   And so the fundamental question that we have to ask ourselves every single day, and sometimes
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:17.000]   God squeezes us and forces us to ask this question, "Do you believe that he is able?"
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:20.320]   That the power and the resource is in him.
[00:26:20.320 --> 00:26:23.480]   And that's the first and the most important part of this gospel, because if you don't
[00:26:23.480 --> 00:26:31.620]   believe he is able, all he becomes is a security blanket.
[00:26:31.620 --> 00:26:37.080]   Security blankets don't have any power, but it makes you feel good.
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:41.000]   When the boogeyman comes, you grab the security blanket, it just makes you feel good.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.120]   Because the boogeyman is not real, so the protection is not real.
[00:26:46.120 --> 00:26:49.920]   It's just to make you feel good.
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.540]   But if you believe he is able, it changes our pursuit.
[00:26:56.540 --> 00:26:59.800]   It changes where we seek counseling.
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:01.360]   It changes our hope.
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:03.280]   It changes our life.
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:04.740]   And isn't that why we pray to him?
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:08.160]   Because we believe he is able to forgive my sins?
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:13.240]   And the reason why he is able to forgive my sins is because of what he has done?
[00:27:13.240 --> 00:27:16.160]   Because he is powerful?
[00:27:16.160 --> 00:27:21.120]   The second point is related to this because he says, "Now to him who is able to establish
[00:27:21.120 --> 00:27:24.480]   you according to my gospel and the preaching of Jesus Christ."
[00:27:24.480 --> 00:27:28.400]   So if you look at the second line, preaching of the gospel and preaching of Jesus Christ
[00:27:28.400 --> 00:27:30.660]   is used interchangeably.
[00:27:30.660 --> 00:27:35.200]   Because in the end, Jesus is the gospel.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:39.560]   Jesus himself, not only is he the end goal of the gospel, it says he is the gospel.
[00:27:39.560 --> 00:27:43.920]   Colossians 1:16, "For by him all things were created, both in the heavens and on earth,
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:48.400]   visible and invisible, whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority, all things
[00:27:48.400 --> 00:27:52.640]   have been created through him and for him."
[00:27:52.640 --> 00:27:58.760]   So the point of the gospel is to bring us to God, to bring us to him.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:02.960]   First Peter 3.18, "For Christ also died for sins once for all, the just for the unjust,
[00:28:02.960 --> 00:28:04.800]   so that he must," what?
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:11.160]   Bring us to God.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:17.280]   Coming to church and missing this, this is not just one of many important things.
[00:28:17.280 --> 00:28:19.200]   This is the church.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:20.320]   This is Christianity.
[00:28:20.320 --> 00:28:21.520]   This is the gospel.
[00:28:21.520 --> 00:28:22.520]   Jesus is the gospel.
[00:28:22.520 --> 00:28:31.160]   Have you ever met anybody that loves the Lakers but hates basketball?
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:37.160]   I have, and it's weird.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:42.000]   They love the yellow jersey, you know.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:43.000]   They love the shoes.
[00:28:43.000 --> 00:28:46.680]   They're interested in what kind of shoes they wear.
[00:28:46.680 --> 00:28:50.120]   They love the experience of going to the stadium.
[00:28:50.120 --> 00:28:51.120]   They even like the food.
[00:28:51.120 --> 00:28:54.120]   They're weird, you know.
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:29:00.800]   $13 hot dogs, $8 Coke, that whole experience, you know.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.880]   But then when the basketball game is turned on, they're not interested.
[00:29:05.880 --> 00:29:08.560]   And I always wondered, like, why would they do that?
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:11.800]   Why would they go through all of that trouble?
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:16.360]   And I realized the reason why they do that is because they're trying to please somebody.
[00:29:16.360 --> 00:29:21.560]   They have a group of friends that really love Lakers, and they're trying to love the Lakers.
[00:29:21.560 --> 00:29:22.560]   They don't.
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:25.480]   They don't like basketball, but they're just trying to fit in.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:31.040]   So they're trying to get all the benefits of being a Lakers fan without liking basketball.
[00:29:31.040 --> 00:29:34.320]   I've seen some good wives do that, or girlfriends.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:35.320]   Usually it's the girlfriends.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:42.440]   Once they become wives, it's like, there's no need, right?
[00:29:42.440 --> 00:29:43.760]   I've seen some girlfriends do that.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:49.320]   They try so hard because this guy's a diehard Lakers fan, and she's just trying to be a
[00:29:49.320 --> 00:29:51.360]   good girlfriend, you know.
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:55.520]   So she goes to the games, and she gets the jersey, and when he gets excited, she doesn't
[00:29:55.520 --> 00:29:58.960]   even know what she's like, "Oh, yeah!"
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:02.080]   She doesn't even know what's going on.
[00:30:02.080 --> 00:30:06.400]   But she's trying really hard, and when their friends get together and play basketball,
[00:30:06.400 --> 00:30:10.640]   she sits with them, she chits with them, she yells with them, and wears the jerseys and
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:16.920]   shoes and all of that, but she has no interest in basketball.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.960]   And she's doing all of that because she wants to be a part of the game.
[00:30:20.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   She wants to appease her boyfriend or her husband.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:37.360]   Christianity without Christ looks exactly the same.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:44.320]   We're trying so hard to get the benefits of Christianity, benefits of being a follower
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:48.400]   of Christ and being around other people who love Christ because you want to be a part
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:49.400]   of that.
[00:30:49.400 --> 00:30:52.840]   You want to appease somebody, your leader, your brother, your sister, your parents, or
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:31:01.200]   your small group leaders, but there is no affection for Christ.
[00:31:01.200 --> 00:31:04.280]   You can talk about church and small group and missions.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.640]   You can talk about hermeneutics and theological systems, and you can talk about everything
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:18.200]   except when you talk about the beauty of Christ, there's a blank look because that's not their
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:21.760]   attraction.
[00:31:21.760 --> 00:31:26.800]   Trying so hard to get the benefits of Christianity without Christ, you miss the whole point.
[00:31:26.800 --> 00:31:34.400]   You can live your whole life and then to not to know Christ.
[00:31:34.400 --> 00:31:41.200]   You can preach, you can miss the gospel, you can even go to foreign lands, you can be generous,
[00:31:41.200 --> 00:31:49.000]   you can serve, you can sacrifice, you can be generous, all with a deep affection for
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:53.760]   Christ and you miss the whole point.
[00:31:53.760 --> 00:31:59.960]   That's why Jesus says, "I am the bread of life."
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:02.960]   He's talking to a group of people who are coming because they were fed and he said they
[00:32:02.960 --> 00:32:06.040]   want more and Jesus says, "Do you not know I am the bread of life?
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:09.560]   I give you this bread to teach you that I am the bread of life."
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:12.640]   John chapter 8, 12.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:15.360]   He's talking to a group of people who are waiting for the Messiah to come and be the
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:18.720]   light and Jesus says, "I am that light."
[00:32:18.720 --> 00:32:24.760]   John 10, he's talking to a group of people who are being shunned from the synagogue if
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:29.240]   he didn't submit to the leaders and Jesus says, "I am the door.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:32.440]   I am the good shepherd."
[00:32:32.440 --> 00:32:36.800]   He's talking to a group of people who are sad because Lazarus died and Jesus says to
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.920]   them, "I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:43.720]   John 14, 6, as people are staggering, "Where should we go?
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:44.720]   Who should we follow?"
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:46.080]   Jesus says, "I am the way.
[00:32:46.080 --> 00:32:49.400]   I am the truth and I am the life."
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:55.200]   And then he tells his disciples, John 15, as he is about to depart, he says, "I am the
[00:32:55.200 --> 00:32:56.200]   true vine.
[00:32:56.200 --> 00:32:58.600]   You continue with me.
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.680]   Everything that I have said to you, you continue even when I am gone.
[00:33:03.680 --> 00:33:06.600]   I am."
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:08.320]   Without faith it is impossible to please God.
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:12.040]   He who comes to God must first believe that he is.
[00:33:12.040 --> 00:33:14.040]   He is.
[00:33:14.040 --> 00:33:16.040]   He is.
[00:33:16.040 --> 00:33:19.320]   That's the introduction of the whole book of Hebrews.
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:26.200]   We're going to spend probably another two, three years going over he is because that's
[00:33:26.200 --> 00:33:29.520]   the summary of the theme of the book of Hebrews.
[00:33:29.520 --> 00:33:36.020]   Until we recognize he is, there is no reward for good works in the church.
[00:33:36.020 --> 00:33:37.580]   There is no reward for hard work.
[00:33:37.580 --> 00:33:46.700]   There is no reward for generosity until we are connected to Christ in faith.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:54.980]   Colossians 1, 1 Corinthians 1, 22 to 24, "For indeed, Jews ask for signs and Greeks search
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:59.420]   for wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:02.940]   To the Jews a stumbling block and Gentiles foolishness, but to those who are called,
[00:34:02.940 --> 00:34:10.980]   both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[00:34:10.980 --> 00:34:16.140]   Years ago, every year we go out to China for mission work and one year we couldn't go because
[00:34:16.140 --> 00:34:17.140]   of SARS.
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:22.820]   So last minute we were directed by our denomination to go to Romania and we were in Bucharest
[00:34:22.820 --> 00:34:29.180]   in Romania and in that area we found this one church and it was a very majestic church.
[00:34:29.180 --> 00:34:32.300]   It's the kind of church that you don't normally see today because it would just cost way too
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:33.300]   much money.
[00:34:33.300 --> 00:34:37.460]   You know, you could tell the stones that the walls are made out of was just like two feet
[00:34:37.460 --> 00:34:39.060]   thick.
[00:34:39.060 --> 00:34:43.820]   And what was interesting was it was built in somewhere around 1490 something, so about
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:47.560]   10 or 15 years before the Reformation took place.
[00:34:47.560 --> 00:34:52.820]   So it was a Catholic church that was created and at the early stage of the church it went
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:54.620]   through a Reformation.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:58.180]   So you can still see it in the building, all over the building where you have little Catholic
[00:34:58.180 --> 00:35:04.260]   figures of Mary and the saints and all over that the Catholics were praying to and they
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.580]   never took it down.
[00:35:06.580 --> 00:35:11.420]   And it said this church went through a transformation and went through the Reformation and it says
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:16.860]   on one of the plaques in the walls it says that Martin Luther visited this church.
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:21.860]   And it was a very, very majestic church because it would fit maybe about 1500 people on the
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.540]   seats and I've always wondered how the church at that time would preach in that kind of
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.380]   a setting because they didn't have a mic system.
[00:35:29.380 --> 00:35:34.820]   And I have a pretty loud voice but even in this room I'd have to yell pretty loud for
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:37.140]   people to hear.
[00:35:37.140 --> 00:35:40.460]   Well it made a lot of sense because when I entered everything was made out of marble
[00:35:40.460 --> 00:35:43.500]   so I could just snap my finger and it would ring everywhere.
[00:35:43.500 --> 00:35:47.300]   I can speak to you softly and the person in the front, the person in the back would have
[00:35:47.300 --> 00:35:48.300]   no problem hearing.
[00:35:48.300 --> 00:35:53.180]   So the way that they had it was they would have whoever was preaching, not preaching
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:58.420]   like this, they would have the person, it would be a long row so you can imagine how
[00:35:58.420 --> 00:36:02.420]   big this place was for about 1700 people to fit into this long row.
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:06.620]   And then the pastor, whoever is giving the sermon, would actually preach in the middle,
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.940]   not in the front.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:12.220]   So if you're sitting in the front you would have to turn back to listen to the preacher.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:16.020]   And so the preacher is elevated literally to the second floor.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.980]   And so he would be preaching straight down.
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.060]   And so you can see why they did that because without the mic system it was for everybody
[00:36:24.060 --> 00:36:25.620]   to hear.
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:27.940]   And so it became a place where everybody visited.
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:32.780]   In fact they said that Martin Luther possibly could have preached on that pulpit.
[00:36:32.780 --> 00:36:38.620]   And so I tried to sneak up there to see and of course I got yelled at.
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:42.180]   But it was just the history behind this church.
[00:36:42.180 --> 00:36:46.980]   And then I asked the people who were basically taking care of this, "Does a church actually
[00:36:46.980 --> 00:36:47.980]   meet here?"
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:51.580]   And you kind of have to think for a little bit and say, "Well, there are people that
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:53.940]   meet but it's not necessarily a church.
[00:36:53.940 --> 00:36:59.100]   There's maybe a group of maybe about 15 to 20 people who are here to take care of the
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:00.100]   church.
[00:37:00.100 --> 00:37:04.660]   So they make sure that it's clean, they make sure that people like me don't go up to the
[00:37:04.660 --> 00:37:09.140]   pulpit and so they kind of take care of the facility.
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:14.700]   And they do gather but I don't know if I would call it a church."
[00:37:14.700 --> 00:37:19.540]   And I remember just when they told me that it's like, "Wow, you have a historic church
[00:37:19.540 --> 00:37:24.060]   where Martin Luther may have preached on the pulpit.
[00:37:24.060 --> 00:37:27.380]   It was one of the first churches that went through the Reformation and you can actually
[00:37:27.380 --> 00:37:34.100]   even see it in the building but God is not being worshipped in this room."
[00:37:34.100 --> 00:37:41.060]   And I remember how sad it was just to have the remnant, just a building of somewhere,
[00:37:41.060 --> 00:37:44.140]   something so fantastic happened.
[00:37:44.140 --> 00:37:48.780]   And yet what it was created for was being ignored.
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:38:01.060]   Sad to say, so many Christians can relate that we have all the forms of religiosity
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:09.620]   but do not know the power of God because they don't know Jesus.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:19.540]   To me, you could think about hunger for the orphans and so many horrible things that are
[00:38:19.540 --> 00:38:26.140]   going on in the world and all of these things deserve our compassion.
[00:38:26.140 --> 00:38:35.700]   But to me, the saddest thing is being so close to the power of God and living your whole
[00:38:35.700 --> 00:38:49.980]   life, whole life giving, serving, pretending and not knowing Him.
[00:38:49.980 --> 00:38:57.460]   It's like being at a buffet and being so hungry and starving to death and you never eat.
[00:38:57.460 --> 00:39:05.460]   Until you meet Christ, all of this is for nothing.
[00:39:05.460 --> 00:39:09.700]   There is no reward for church attendance.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:15.140]   There is no reward for memorizing Scripture.
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:20.700]   There is no reward for being active at church.
[00:39:20.700 --> 00:39:26.180]   There is no reward for titles.
[00:39:26.180 --> 00:39:29.740]   There is no reward because you're a leader.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:33.460]   There is no reward for that.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:37.940]   Only He is able to establish us.
[00:39:37.940 --> 00:39:45.340]   And until we meet Christ, all is for nothing.
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:47.860]   Jesus is the gospel.
[00:39:47.860 --> 00:39:50.460]   He is the gospel.
[00:39:50.460 --> 00:39:56.140]   So I want to ask you the fundamental question, do you believe Him?
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:40:00.740]   I'm not asking you, are you a theist versus an atheist?
[00:40:00.740 --> 00:40:03.700]   That's not the question.
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:09.900]   Do you believe in this God?
[00:40:09.900 --> 00:40:16.300]   Do you believe that He is able?
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:22.020]   If you do, how does that change us?
[00:40:22.020 --> 00:40:24.780]   That's the gospel.
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:27.980]   That's the gospel.
[00:40:27.980 --> 00:40:32.180]   A man cannot confess the gospel in reality and not be changed.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:34.340]   It is not possible.
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:39.420]   You cannot be in the presence and have seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.300]   then look at the world and say, "You know what?
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:43.300]   I'd rather have that."
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:45.580]   Then you didn't see Him.
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:48.220]   You didn't see Him.
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:53.180]   If you look at the world, it is more tempting to you to go that direction than to want Christ.
[00:40:53.180 --> 00:40:54.540]   You didn't see Him.
[00:40:54.540 --> 00:40:59.820]   Because that's the only way I can understand how somebody can confess and still run to
[00:40:59.820 --> 00:41:02.300]   the world.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:03.620]   You didn't see Him.
[00:41:03.620 --> 00:41:08.060]   It is not possible to see the beauty of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:13.940]   It is not possible for a man to confront this living God and then turn the other way and
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:17.560]   say, "That is better."
[00:41:17.560 --> 00:41:18.700]   It does not make any sense.
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:19.980]   It is illogical.
[00:41:19.980 --> 00:41:25.300]   That's why in Romans chapter 12 it says, "It is a reasonable response to give our bodies
[00:41:25.300 --> 00:41:32.240]   as a living sacrifice in light of the mercy that we have heard."
[00:41:32.240 --> 00:41:33.240]   God is the gospel.
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:35.660]   Jesus is the gospel.
[00:41:35.660 --> 00:41:40.020]   This morning as we participate in the communion, He says that's the reason why we have the
[00:41:40.020 --> 00:41:44.260]   communion, to proclaim His death and resurrection, to remind us again what it is that we have
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:49.420]   in Christ, that maybe all of our frustrations, all of our hopes and desires have been placed
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:54.620]   on something that is only going to disappoint, and to remind us again that our hope is found
[00:41:54.620 --> 00:41:56.260]   in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:41:56.260 --> 00:42:00.980]   So as we open up the communion table, I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to
[00:42:00.980 --> 00:42:02.980]   pray, to come up.
[00:42:02.980 --> 00:42:07.380]   If you're a baptized believer, we ask you to come up, again, from the sides and go down
[00:42:07.380 --> 00:42:10.180]   the middle so that we don't create traffic here.
[00:42:10.180 --> 00:42:14.820]   Then if you are visiting us or you have not been properly baptized, we ask that you would
[00:42:14.820 --> 00:42:19.260]   just sit and contemplate in prayer.
[00:42:19.260 --> 00:42:22.700]   So when you are ready, we ask that one by one that you would come up.
[00:42:22.700 --> 00:42:36.820]   Let me open up the communion table by reading 1 Corinthians chapter 11.
[00:42:36.820 --> 00:42:41.420]   For I received from the Lord that which I also deliver to you, that the Lord Jesus in
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:44.740]   the night in which He was betrayed took bread.
[00:42:44.740 --> 00:42:48.180]   And when He had given thanks, He broke it and said, "This is my body, which is for you.
[00:42:48.180 --> 00:42:50.660]   Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:42:50.660 --> 00:42:54.860]   In the same way, He took the cup also after supper, saying, "This cup is a new covenant
[00:42:54.860 --> 00:42:55.940]   in my blood.
[00:42:55.940 --> 00:43:00.700]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me."
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:08.580]   Heavenly Father, you know our sins of our hearts.
[00:43:08.580 --> 00:43:13.420]   You know, Father God, how often we struggle, Lord God, because we take our eyes off of
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   you.
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.780]   I pray that this communion table would help us to fix our eyes upon Christ, the author
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:21.380]   and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:43:21.380 --> 00:43:27.180]   I pray, Father God, if we have been given you worship externally but internally, filled
[00:43:27.180 --> 00:43:34.340]   with pride, with coveting, with lust, with guilt.
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:41.740]   I pray, Father God, that breaking of your body, breaking of drinking of the blood, would
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:45.260]   cause us, Lord God, to be renewed in our dedication.
[00:43:45.260 --> 00:43:47.620]   We pray, Father God, that you would anoint this sacred time.
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:48.620]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:48.620]   Amen.
[00:43:48.620 --> 00:43:49.300]   Amen.
