[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.680]   And then we'll jump into the text this morning. Romans chapter 3 verses 1-8. And we'll continue
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:18.660]   what we started last week. Romans chapter 3 verses 1-8, reading out of the ESV. "Then
[00:00:18.660 --> 00:00:24.120]   what advantage has the Jew, or what is the value of circumcision? Much in every way.
[00:00:24.120 --> 00:00:29.200]   To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God. What if some were unfaithful?
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   Does their faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? By no means. Let God be true, though
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:39.120]   everyone were a liar, as it is written, that you may be justified in your words and prevail
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.680]   when you are judged. But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:50.840]   shall we say? That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us? I speak in a human way, by no
[00:00:50.840 --> 00:00:56.040]   means. For then how could God judge the world? But if through my life God's truth abounds
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:00.920]   to His glory, why am I still being condemned as a sinner? And why not do evil that good
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.520]   may come, as some people slanderously charge us with saying? Their condemnation is just."
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:13.440]   Let's pray. Heavenly Father, we ask that your Holy Spirit would lead and guide us.
[00:01:13.440 --> 00:01:18.980]   That the words that come out of my mouth, Lord God, would be filtered by your Holy Spirit.
[00:01:18.980 --> 00:01:23.720]   That only your words and your thoughts and your intentions, Lord God, would bear fruit.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:30.040]   So I pray, Father, with trembling, with cautiousness, Lord God, that your word may be revealed to
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:36.680]   your children. That we may hear the voice of our Lord Jesus Christ and follow Him. And
[00:01:36.680 --> 00:01:41.400]   so we pray for your anointing this morning. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:47.760]   How many of you have heard the ministry called Promise Keepers? Okay. Also a few of you.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:53.960]   Okay, so I know exactly how old you are. All right. So Promise Keepers, yes I see you.
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:59.520]   Okay. So Promise Keepers was a ministry that started in 1990 by the head football coach
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:05.320]   at University of Colorado Boulder, Colorado, Bill McCartney. And basically the ministry,
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:10.880]   again I've never been to their conference, but the conference started mainly geared toward
[00:02:10.880 --> 00:02:15.320]   bringing revival among men. And the reason why they kept making Promise Keepers is to
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:20.840]   remind the men of the covenant that they made with their wives. Yesterday we had a wedding
[00:02:20.840 --> 00:02:25.920]   with Eugene and Susie and every time you get married, obviously when we have marriages
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.760]   we have the same covenant that we make, that the husband is going to represent Christ in
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:37.000]   this home. And to love sacrificially to lead her as Christ did to the church. And so it's
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.520]   called the Promise Keepers, again it's to challenge the men to lead in their homes.
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:47.160]   To keep the promise that they made at the altar. It was a huge movement. I believe it's
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:51.760]   still going on today. Again, I've never been to one. I don't know the content of what is
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.240]   taught, but I know the history behind it. And it was a big movement. Especially early
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:03:00.880]   on you heard about Promise Keepers everywhere in Los Angeles, Orange County, in every segment
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:06.240]   of United States and even outside the United States because there was a tremendous need
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:13.200]   to challenge, especially the men, to act like men. To keep the promises. I mean think about
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:18.640]   in our generation, how many people you can think of that say, "That guy makes a promise,
[00:03:18.640 --> 00:03:29.640]   he keeps it. His word is basically, you can bank on it." I think today in our generation
[00:03:29.640 --> 00:03:35.840]   to find people who are really true to their word, again it's becoming more and more of
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.520]   a difficult reality. In fact today, when people make promises, and again the older you get,
[00:03:40.520 --> 00:03:45.600]   you get jaded with promises of people because you get so disappointed. Typically when people
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:50.280]   make promises, when you're younger you get excited when people promise certain things,
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:54.240]   but the older you get you're just kind of like, "Okay, we'll see." You know what I mean?
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:04:01.400]   Like everything, we say, "Yeah, we'll see." Because we get disappointed by people. See,
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:07.840]   question that comes up in this text in chapter 3 is related to this idea of keeping promise.
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:12.360]   The reason why is because Paul's been telling the Jews in the first two chapters, "You're
[00:04:12.360 --> 00:04:16.840]   no different than the Gentiles." Think about it, for hundreds of years, that's exactly
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:21.280]   what they thought. They thought they were completely different than the Gentiles because
[00:04:21.280 --> 00:04:27.240]   they were God's chosen people. And God continually reminds them over and over again that you
[00:04:27.240 --> 00:04:32.640]   are not like other nations. God tells them, if you go into the Promised Land, do not intermarry
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:38.640]   with them because you are a chosen generation. You're a holy nation, right? You're a royal
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:45.680]   priesthood. But all of a sudden, Paul, in presenting the Gospel, setting the foundation,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:50.160]   he's saying, "No, Gentiles are Jews and Jews are no different." So last week, the first
[00:04:50.160 --> 00:04:54.760]   question that came up was, "If that's the case, then what is the benefit of being a
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:59.240]   Jew?" What is the benefit? So that's the first question that came up. And the answer
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:03.880]   that he says, "Of course, in every way. How can you possibly even ask that question?"
[00:05:03.880 --> 00:05:10.400]   He said, "Of all the benefits that you have, first and foremost, you have the Word of God."
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:15.320]   God gave His general revelation, left His imprint in creation. But to you, you have
[00:05:15.320 --> 00:05:21.680]   special revelation. God drew near and spoke to you and gave you the specifics of His redemptive
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:29.360]   plan. So this is a follow-up question from that, that if that's the case, if God is faithful
[00:05:29.360 --> 00:05:35.440]   to Himself, right, and we are no different, and we just have the Law of God, and that's
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:40.080]   the only difference between us and the Gentiles, the follow-up question to that is, what if
[00:05:40.080 --> 00:05:44.680]   some were unfaithful? Meaning that if, because of the unfaithfulness of the Jews, does their
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.960]   faithlessness nullify the faithfulness of God? That's basically what they're saying
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:58.680]   is all these years we've been told that God made a covenant with our forefathers, right,
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:04.800]   Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob. And for generations to come, to David, to Solomon, God made a
[00:06:04.800 --> 00:06:09.000]   covenant that He was going to remain faithful to the nation of Israel. Now you're telling
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.240]   me that we're no different. If a Jew died in his state, that he would stand before a
[00:06:15.240 --> 00:06:23.040]   God and be judged the same way as a Gentile. So if that's the case, because of the faithlessness
[00:06:23.040 --> 00:06:28.120]   of the Jews, does that mean that God will become faithless? That He will nullify His
[00:06:28.120 --> 00:06:35.320]   covenant that He made with us? Well, He deals with this question in a more elaborate way
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:41.200]   in 1st chapter 9, 10, and 11. So He's going to spend three chapters basically expounding
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:45.480]   this idea, trying to answer this question. So today He's just going to answer it in a
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:49.920]   couple sentences, and then He's going to leave the bigger dissertation in the next, when
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:54.600]   we get to chapter 9, 10, and 11. But let me give you a glimpse of the idea that He gives.
[00:06:54.600 --> 00:06:59.960]   In Romans 11, 1 through 2, the same answer is given, same question is given. I asked
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:08.120]   him, "Has God rejected His people?" Is He done with Israel? "By no means." Next time
[00:07:08.120 --> 00:07:13.580]   you read the book of Romans and you see that term "by no means," try to circle it or highlight
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:20.960]   it because He's using the strongest of a language that He can possibly use to answer this question.
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:24.680]   Basically what He's saying is, "Of course not. Are you kidding?" That's the way you
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:29.840]   really should read in English, right? It seems a lot more gentle, "By no means," right? A
[00:07:29.840 --> 00:07:37.880]   lot more civilized. But He's basically saying, "Are you kidding me? By no means, for I myself
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:43.120]   am an Israelite." So in other words, saying, "Hey, this guy Paul is coming around and saying
[00:07:43.120 --> 00:07:47.600]   God is done with the nation of Israel." He's basically saying that everything that we've
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.840]   been standing, we've stood for, for hundreds of years, this guy's nullifying. And He says,
[00:07:52.840 --> 00:07:58.080]   "No, by no means. I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe
[00:07:58.080 --> 00:08:04.960]   of Benjamin. God has not rejected His people whom He foreknew. God has not rejected His
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:10.720]   people." So the answer is crystal clear. That is not the case. The Gospel does not nullify
[00:08:10.720 --> 00:08:19.960]   the nation of Israel. In Genesis chapter 12, right, verse 2, when God first makes a covenant
[00:08:19.960 --> 00:08:26.360]   with Abraham and his descendants, the nation of Israel, He says, "And I will make of you
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:32.360]   a great nation. I will bless you and make your name great, so that you will be a blessing."
[00:08:32.360 --> 00:08:37.840]   So He begins this covenant that He makes with Abraham, what we will say is an unconditional
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:44.240]   covenant. Meaning, just like a marriage covenant, we don't have two people stand up and say,
[00:08:44.240 --> 00:08:48.200]   "You know what? I'm going to enter this covenant relationship. And if you do the dishes, I
[00:08:48.200 --> 00:08:53.240]   will do the laundry. If you clean your master bedroom, I will clean the bathroom." That
[00:08:53.240 --> 00:08:57.760]   is not the covenant that a husband and wife enters into. A covenant a husband and wife
[00:08:57.760 --> 00:09:02.560]   enters into is an unconditional covenant. That is a covenant saying, "Just as Christ
[00:09:02.560 --> 00:09:07.560]   loved the Church unconditionally, I will love you unconditionally. And just as the Church
[00:09:07.560 --> 00:09:13.560]   submits to the Lord unconditionally, I will serve the Lord unconditionally." It is a unilateral,
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:19.040]   unconditional covenant that a husband and wife enters into. It is not contingent upon
[00:09:19.040 --> 00:09:24.200]   the other person and what they do. That even if they don't do their part, you're saying,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:29.720]   "I'm committing to this covenant." Well, that is the covenant that God enters into with
[00:09:29.720 --> 00:09:36.880]   the nation of Israel. He says, "I will do this. I will do this." Again, in Genesis chapter
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:44.040]   15, 17-18. When God ratifies this covenant, typically the way that a covenant is ratified
[00:09:44.040 --> 00:09:49.040]   is they would take two animals, cut them in half, and it's a very brutal, violent scene.
[00:09:49.040 --> 00:09:53.760]   They would take these two animals, put them in a long row, and it would be a bloody scene.
[00:09:53.760 --> 00:09:57.080]   And the two people who were entering this covenant would hold hands, and they would
[00:09:57.080 --> 00:10:05.400]   walk right in the middle. And what that symbolized was that if either you or I break this covenant,
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:10.760]   that what happened to these animals will happen to us. I welcome it. In other words, that
[00:10:10.760 --> 00:10:16.320]   I'm going to risk my life going into this covenant. Well, in Genesis 15, 17-18, I want
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:20.960]   you to listen carefully. It said, "When the sun had gone down and it was dark, behold,
[00:10:20.960 --> 00:10:27.680]   a smoking fire pot and a flaming torch passed between these two, these pieces. On that day,
[00:10:27.680 --> 00:10:32.520]   the Lord made a covenant with Abram, saying, 'To your offspring I give this land, from
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.080]   the river of Egypt to the great river, the river Euphrates.'" If you paid attention
[00:10:38.080 --> 00:10:43.520]   very closely to what I read, you're going to see that something is missing. What's missing
[00:10:43.520 --> 00:10:49.320]   is right before this passage, it says that Abraham fell asleep. Abraham fell asleep.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:56.680]   Abraham basically did not walk through the middle. God shows up as a flaming torch, and
[00:10:56.680 --> 00:11:02.320]   he goes through this covenant by himself. What that means is that this covenant that
[00:11:02.320 --> 00:11:08.560]   God makes with Abraham and his descendants is completely unconditional. There is no part
[00:11:08.560 --> 00:11:14.280]   that Abraham plays in this particular covenant with the nation of Israel. If you study the
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:19.980]   book of Genesis and all throughout Israel's history, God clarifies this covenant over
[00:11:19.980 --> 00:11:25.160]   and over. So, there are some covenants that God makes that are conditional, and then there
[00:11:25.160 --> 00:11:29.960]   are some covenants that are unconditional. The conditional covenant is He makes with
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:33.720]   the nation of Israel, if you go there and then if you obey My commandments, God will
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:39.800]   cause you to live long, you'll be blessed, you'll be healthy, your children are going
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.120]   to live well, peacefully in this land. But if you don't, judgment is coming. But the
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:48.000]   unconditional covenant that God makes with the nation of Israel is that He was going
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:53.160]   to bless them, and that through blessing them, all the other nations will be blessed. And
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:59.120]   that was unconditional. So, the nation of Israel hearing this, obviously, thought we
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:02.560]   are special because God made this covenant with us. He didn't make this covenant with
[00:12:02.560 --> 00:12:07.920]   every other nation. He made this covenant specifically with the nation of Israel. And
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.400]   for the purpose, not just the nation of Israel, to for the whole world. He just chose them
[00:12:14.400 --> 00:12:25.960]   to work through. So, the question that they're asking is, if we stand guilty like the Gentiles,
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:31.400]   does that mean that God is going to nullify His covenant? That if the faithlessness of
[00:12:31.400 --> 00:12:38.440]   some of the Gentile or Israelites, is that going to cause God to be unfaithful as well?
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:48.040]   And the answer is, of course not. By no means. May it never be. Absolutely not. Romans 3,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:55.480]   4, "Let God be true, though everyone were a liar." Even if every human being, even if
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:04.220]   they are found to be false, God will never, He cannot deny Himself. God can't deny Himself.
[00:13:04.220 --> 00:13:08.080]   God is not man that He should lie, nor the Son of Man that He should repent. God never
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:12.720]   says anything and have to take it back. God never says that He's going to do something
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:16.480]   and say, "You know what? Maybe my plan wasn't good." You know, every single one of us, when
[00:13:16.480 --> 00:13:23.520]   we make plans, we have plan A, plan B, plan C, plan D, plan F, whatever, right? We have
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:28.560]   all these plans because our desire is A. You know, you may work hard. Some of you guys
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:33.240]   working hard to get an A on your finals. You have every intention. And you're going to
[00:13:33.240 --> 00:13:37.140]   make every effort. You're not a slacker. You're going to stay up until 3 in the morning. Everybody
[00:13:37.140 --> 00:13:40.960]   else is going to be outside, you know, like playing around with their friends, but not
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.400]   you. You're going to be here until 2 in the morning, and then you're going to go home,
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:50.760]   drink some coffee, you're going to study until 4, and you've been diligent all year, right?
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:54.840]   And you have every intent. But you're a human being. You don't know what's going to be on
[00:13:54.840 --> 00:14:00.880]   the test, right? You may be a worker, you know, and you have some kind of assignment.
[00:14:00.880 --> 00:14:06.920]   You have every intent to please your boss and to get this assignment right. But the
[00:14:06.920 --> 00:14:10.840]   problem is we're human beings. We can't control the outcome. So you always have plan A, and
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:16.820]   then you have plan B, plan C, plan D. What Paul is saying is even if every man falls
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:24.040]   short of his plan, God will not. God cannot because he cannot deny himself. He cannot
[00:14:24.040 --> 00:14:30.780]   deny, he cannot change his mind, and he cannot change his nature. It is because of the covenant
[00:14:30.780 --> 00:14:36.120]   that he had made with the nation of Israel and to mankind that you and I are even here
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:43.160]   today, right? Think about the symbol of the rainbow. I know today when we think rainbow,
[00:14:43.160 --> 00:14:48.640]   we think of the LGBT community. But the original sign of the rainbow in the Old Testament was
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:56.600]   to remind us of his unconditional covenant with his people. Genesis 9, 15-16, he says,
[00:14:56.600 --> 00:15:03.000]   "I will remember my covenant between me and you and all living creatures of every kind.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.160]   Never again will the waters become a flood to destroy all life. Whenever the rainbow
[00:15:07.160 --> 00:15:11.600]   appears in the clouds, I will see it and remember the everlasting covenant between God and all
[00:15:11.600 --> 00:15:20.600]   living creatures, every kind on the earth." The only reason why you and I are here today
[00:15:20.600 --> 00:15:26.540]   is because God is faithful to his promises. Think about how often we work on something
[00:15:26.540 --> 00:15:30.720]   and we get frustrated and we just want to just scratch everything, right? I don't know
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.200]   about you, but I'm like that with computers. Like I'm not detail-oriented and I didn't
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:41.600]   really mess around with computers until probably my 30s. So computer, you know, some of you
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:45.740]   guys who were, you know, engineers when you were back in college, and I'm sure computer
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:50.200]   was in at that time, but I was a Bible major. So, you know, I remember sharing with somebody
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:57.840]   that I never wrote a paper on the computer until I graduated seminary. Like what? Yeah,
[00:15:57.840 --> 00:16:01.960]   computer was just not around in the late 80s, early 90s, you know, it was just starting
[00:16:01.960 --> 00:16:07.040]   to come in. So today, if I'm doing something and something goes wrong with the computer,
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.480]   like I usually have to call Brian, you know, or when Pastor Aaron was here, I used to always
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:16.320]   just, "Hey, can you take a look at this?" And they'll fix it. But most of the times,
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.880]   you know, I don't have people around and I would try to mess around with it and it'd
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:25.400]   take me a couple hours and my immediate inclination is, "Buy a new computer." Like that's, so
[00:16:25.400 --> 00:16:29.480]   if it was up to me, I would buy a new computer every two, three months. You know, and I just
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:36.040]   scratch it. Like, you know, I don't have the patience for this, right? Imagine when God,
[00:16:36.040 --> 00:16:40.520]   God was so frustrated with creation that He was so angry and grieved, He wiped out the
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:48.040]   whole earth and repopulated with eight people. Imagine how often He must have been tempted.
[00:16:48.040 --> 00:16:54.600]   Imagine all the sins of the nation of Israel, right? Periods when they were outright just
[00:16:54.600 --> 00:17:00.080]   denying Him, even after feeding them, caring for them, being patient with them. And as
[00:17:00.080 --> 00:17:03.340]   soon as He turned around, they said, "Oh, you don't give us water. I wish we were back
[00:17:03.340 --> 00:17:07.960]   in Egypt." There were periods in Israel's history where they were actually sacrificing
[00:17:07.960 --> 00:17:14.760]   their own children to the God of Malak. I mean, think about how often God must have
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:21.200]   been grieved and angered by the sins of His people that He said, "That's enough." Even
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:27.760]   if as patient as our God is, if you've ever read through the Bible, Old Testament, Israelite's
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:32.000]   history, just from beginning to the end, by the time you get to about first Kings, you
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:36.080]   don't even have to get to second Kings, first Kings. You're not thinking like, "Oh, God
[00:17:36.080 --> 00:17:40.280]   is so, you know, wrathful." You know, that's how you normally think of Old Testament when
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:46.320]   you just hear bits and pieces. But when you read the history of Israel, just systematically,
[00:17:46.320 --> 00:17:52.360]   by the time you get to about third or fourth King in Israel, you start thinking like, "Oh
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:59.160]   my gosh, why does God put up with these people?" Right? I mean, you would think at some point
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:05.840]   God would say, "Enough." Think about the last 2,000 years of church history. Think about
[00:18:05.840 --> 00:18:12.000]   the chaos and the mess. Think about the Crusades. Think about the Inquisition, the selling of
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:18.920]   indulgences. Think about just even in modern history, how divided we are. Right? How chaotic
[00:18:18.920 --> 00:18:25.560]   the modern day church is, the church growth. Think about in the last 2,000 years what church
[00:18:25.560 --> 00:18:34.000]   history looked like. Think about how tempted our God must be knowing how angry He is towards
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:40.440]   us. And we say, "Just start over." Right? But the only reason why you and I are here
[00:18:40.440 --> 00:18:46.000]   is because God is faithful to His covenant. It's because He's been faithful that you and
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:50.800]   I are not consumed. That's exactly what it says in Lamentations 3.22. "Because of the
[00:18:50.800 --> 00:18:56.240]   Lord's great love, we are not consumed, for His compassion never fails. They are new every
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:02.600]   morning. Great is your faithfulness." So He said, "Because of the faithlessness of some,
[00:19:02.600 --> 00:19:07.960]   will God nullify the covenant?" He says, "By no means. Of course not. Let every man found
[00:19:07.960 --> 00:19:14.760]   to be a liar, but God will remain true to Himself. He is faithful." The question that
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:18.520]   comes up with that is, yes, God is faithful. And that's the reason why you and I are here.
[00:19:18.520 --> 00:19:23.840]   Right? And that's why having the Word of God is so precious to us. Because we have these
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:30.000]   promises. They're not just general revelation. We have special promises of God's covenant
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:35.200]   with His people. And so that's our source of comfort. That's our hope. That's what gives
[00:19:35.200 --> 00:19:40.640]   us strength. That even in the times of trial, we know that God will never change. What He
[00:19:40.640 --> 00:19:47.640]   says, He will do. And we can bank on it. Even if we can't trust anybody else in this world.
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.280]   Even if we can't trust our own wives or children. He said, "You can bank on the things that
[00:19:52.280 --> 00:19:57.800]   God has said." But here comes the next question that comes along with that. Well, if God is
[00:19:57.800 --> 00:20:02.200]   faithful, you know, typically when we think of the faithfulness of God, we think, well,
[00:20:02.200 --> 00:20:10.520]   God is faithful of His mercy. God is faithful in His grace. God is faithful in His compassion.
[00:20:10.520 --> 00:20:15.000]   But when we talk about the faithfulness of God, we're not just talking about His mercy
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:20.400]   and compassion. We're also talking about His promise of judgment. And that's exactly what
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.720]   Paul quotes. Paul quotes Psalm 51, verse 4, in the next passage, when he says that, "You
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:31.840]   may be justified in your words and prevail when you are judged." He's quoting a text
[00:20:31.840 --> 00:20:37.400]   from David's repentance. David repents and he's crying out to God and he said, "You are
[00:20:37.400 --> 00:20:43.800]   just in your judgment." David's life is a perfect example of God's faithfulness to all
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:49.520]   of His covenants. God made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, an unconditional
[00:20:49.520 --> 00:20:54.640]   covenant that He's going to be faithful to His people. But He also promised them that
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:21:00.920]   if you disobey My commandments, judgment will come. As you guys know, David ends up committing
[00:21:00.920 --> 00:21:07.840]   a horrendous sin. And he tries to cover it up. God sends a prophet, exposes him. And
[00:21:07.840 --> 00:21:14.160]   God says, "As a result of your sin, what happens? There will be bloodshed in your family. And
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:17.720]   your children are going to be divided. Your kingdom is going to be divided in two. And
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:23.000]   bloodshed will remain in your family." It's in that context where David is crying out
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.320]   to God. He said, "No, God, You are just." He doesn't stand before God and say, "Lord,
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:32.400]   You're not fair. How come You're not being merciful?" He says, "No, in Your judgment
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:38.880]   You are fair." See, God remained faithful to His covenant that despite David's sin,
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:45.560]   God remained faithful to the nation of Israel. And He even despite all the sins of all the
[00:21:45.560 --> 00:21:50.800]   kings that followed David, one after another, through all the false prophets that came into
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:55.900]   the nation of Israel, God remained faithful to His people. He never squashed the nation
[00:21:55.900 --> 00:22:01.220]   of Israel and said, "We're done with you. Look at all your leaders." So He was faithful
[00:22:01.220 --> 00:22:07.540]   to His promise of His covenant, but He was also faithful to all the promise of judgment
[00:22:07.540 --> 00:22:14.240]   that would come upon that nation if they did not follow Him. See, that's a perfect example
[00:22:14.240 --> 00:22:20.480]   that's expressed in 2 Timothy 2, 11-13, where Paul says, "The saying is trustworthy, for
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:25.600]   if we have died with Him, we will also live with Him. If we endure, we will also reign
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:33.640]   with Him. If we deny Him, He will deny us. If we are faithless, He remains faithful."
[00:22:33.640 --> 00:22:39.040]   See, typically when we think about faithfulness, we just like to choose the faithfulness of
[00:22:39.040 --> 00:22:44.360]   His promise of grace and mercy. But God's faithfulness means that He is faithful first
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.200]   and foremost to Himself. He is faithful in His righteousness, and He is faithful in His
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.880]   mercy. He is faithful in judgment. He is faithful in grace. But He is faithful to Himself. That's
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:03.800]   why what God says, He will do. If He said He's going to punish sin, He's going to punish
[00:23:03.800 --> 00:23:08.280]   sin. He's not just going to sweep it under the rug. He's not going to all of a sudden
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:12.160]   say, "You know what, because I'm merciful, my mercy is going to overpower my justice."
[00:23:12.160 --> 00:23:15.760]   He's just going to sweep it under the rug. You know, "I know I said that judgment is
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:19.200]   going to come upon you, and I know I told you all these curses that's going to come
[00:23:19.200 --> 00:23:24.440]   in Deuteronomy chapter 27, 28, but I'm just going to forget that I said that. And I'm
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:32.640]   just going to hold on to these promises." No. He said He's going to be faithful. Even
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:38.160]   if we're not faithful, God will remain faithful because He cannot deny Himself. That everything
[00:23:38.160 --> 00:23:46.520]   that He says in Scripture, He will do. Salvation and judgment. As much as we would love to
[00:23:46.520 --> 00:23:53.320]   just talk about heaven, the Bible is very clear about the warning of hell. So He is
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:24:00.620]   faithful in the promise of salvation, but He's also faithful in the promise of judgment.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:07.400]   And you see that clearly represented at the cross. Clearly represented at the cross. Because,
[00:24:07.400 --> 00:24:14.800]   again, when we think about the cross of Christ, our immediate thought is His mercy and compassion.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:21.280]   And the reason why we think that is because we're the recipients. We're the recipients.
[00:24:21.280 --> 00:24:27.840]   See that from the perspective of God the Father. See that from the perspective of Jesus. See
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:33.400]   that in the perspective of the angels. Jesus didn't necessarily die for them because they
[00:24:33.400 --> 00:24:39.080]   didn't sin. So see that from the perspective of people where that wasn't for them. We look
[00:24:39.080 --> 00:24:44.520]   upon that and say, "Wait a second." Right? If you weren't the recipients of this atonement,
[00:24:44.520 --> 00:24:50.800]   and all you saw was an innocent man, the Son of God, being crucified for our sins, you
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:57.760]   would look at that and say, "This is horrendous. This is horrendous. How can God do this to
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:04.200]   His Son for these people?" So as much as we look at the cross on this side and say, "Wow,
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:09.120]   God is merciful and gracious and loving," if you were to look at it from this side, the
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:17.280]   cross is also a magnification of His wrath. That's why in Scripture, John 12, 23, when
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.240]   Jesus is about to go to the cross, His prayer is, "The hour has come for the Son of Man
[00:25:22.240 --> 00:25:27.920]   to be glorified." And then He also states that, "As you glorify the Son, I glorify the
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:36.880]   Father." He's talking about His crucifixion. When we talk about glorifying something, right?
[00:25:36.880 --> 00:25:40.360]   Like if, let's say you're talking about, you know, I don't know what's going on, you know,
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:45.200]   Steve Curry, right? Stephen Curry is going nuts and we're, Stephen Curry is going nuts
[00:25:45.200 --> 00:25:49.200]   and he's shooting the basketball, whatever. And when we say we glorify Him, we're talking
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:53.240]   about, we're taking His attributes and who He is, we're putting Him on a pedestal for
[00:25:53.240 --> 00:25:58.960]   everyone to see, right? We're not exaggerating. All we're doing is we're putting it on a pedestal,
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:02.240]   look what He's doing. So you might have video highlights, you might talk about Him, you
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:07.320]   might say, "Wow, that was awesome." That's what we mean by glorifying something, right?
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:12.760]   So when the Son says, "It's time now," like all throughout history, we've been preparing
[00:26:12.760 --> 00:26:18.400]   for this, "Now is the time. Now is the time that everything that God has been doing has
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:23.880]   been leading up to this point. Now is the time to put me on that pedestal," right? "To
[00:26:23.880 --> 00:26:31.280]   be glorified. And when I do that, I'm going to glorify the Father." And so where God and
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:38.760]   His Son and the Holy Spirit is magnified more than any other time in history is at the cross.
[00:26:38.760 --> 00:26:42.840]   That's why we say that everything from the Old Testament leading up to the cross was
[00:26:42.840 --> 00:26:48.040]   kind of like this, it was like a crescendo to Christ and then His crucifixion. And ever
[00:26:48.040 --> 00:26:53.360]   since then, everything else is to look back. So all of us is to point to the cross, and
[00:26:53.360 --> 00:26:59.200]   everybody in the Old Testament is to point toward the cross. The cross is the perfect
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:08.240]   example of God's faithfulness to His holiness and His mercy. Again, you and I have a tendency,
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:12.560]   because we're recipients of this grace, that we just think about His grace. See, but that
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:20.880]   cross without God's holy justice and His wrath would not make any sense. Why not just forgive?
[00:27:20.880 --> 00:27:27.360]   Right? If you did me wrong, and you come and ask for forgiveness, I don't sit there and
[00:27:27.360 --> 00:27:33.480]   cut my wrist and then let it bleed and say, "Now I forgive you." Right? You're going to
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.280]   think, "What's wrong with this guy? This guy's crazy. Why is he cutting himself?" See, the
[00:27:38.280 --> 00:27:46.280]   cross without His justice and wrath would not make any sense. And the cross, though
[00:27:46.280 --> 00:27:51.880]   it is a revelation of His wrath, without His mercy and love would not make any sense. It
[00:27:51.880 --> 00:28:00.040]   is the perfect union of God's faithfulness to Himself, where He, by His nature, who is
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:08.920]   love, desires to save sinful men, without compromising His justice, decided to lay all
[00:28:08.920 --> 00:28:14.560]   that burden, all that wrath upon His Son, so that He is faithful to Himself, because
[00:28:14.560 --> 00:28:23.920]   He cannot deny Himself. The backdrop behind the cross is everything that we know of who
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:30.000]   God is, perfectly displayed. In fact, when Jesus came, He started rebuking the Pharisees,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.120]   saying, "You know, you guys are obeying all the commandments, and you don't understand
[00:28:33.120 --> 00:28:37.280]   the spirit of the Law. You're just going and going through the motion, but that's not what
[00:28:37.280 --> 00:28:41.880]   God desires." And so He started rebuking them for their Pharisee tendencies. So they said,
[00:28:41.880 --> 00:28:46.800]   "You know what? Here comes a man who's trying to abolish the Law." Right? Remember what
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:53.360]   Jesus says in Matthew 5, 17-18? "I have not come to abolish the Law, but to fulfill it."
[00:28:53.360 --> 00:28:59.120]   He said, "Not an iota, not the smallest letter of the Law, will pass away until it is complete."
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:07.040]   In other words, everything God says will happen. And the way that it was going to be fulfilled
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:12.760]   was by His Son crucified on the cross. See, that's the point that Jesus is trying to make,
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:18.960]   because they're having a hard time understanding, if Jesus was crucified for us, or if the Gospel
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:24.320]   says that we are in need of His mercy, and we're no different than the Gentiles, then
[00:29:24.320 --> 00:29:28.360]   what was the purpose of all of this? And He says, "No, it's going to be fulfilled in Christ."
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:36.000]   Right? Not only does God not nullify the covenant, His faithfulness shines even brighter because
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:43.080]   of their sins. Because of it. You know, I read yesterday that you guys heard about the
[00:29:43.080 --> 00:29:50.800]   shooting in San Bernardino, and the more is coming out. And I read yesterday that one
[00:29:50.800 --> 00:29:54.600]   of the men, the husband and wife that went and shot up all these people, that one of
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:29:59.880]   the guys, you probably read it, that the people that he shot up were his old co-workers. They
[00:29:59.880 --> 00:30:03.960]   were having some sort of a Christmas gathering, and that's where he shot up everybody. And
[00:30:03.960 --> 00:30:09.440]   they found out that they had a small child. They had a small child, and before the child
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:16.680]   came, the same co-workers that he shot up actually threw him a baby shower. They threw
[00:30:16.680 --> 00:30:21.840]   him a baby shower. So, after hearing that, I said, "Oh my gosh." You know? I mean, what
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.120]   he did in and of itself was horrendous. But considering that his co-worker, and they say,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:30.240]   "Oh, we're all very tight-knit group," and it was shocking for all of us that he did
[00:30:30.240 --> 00:30:34.760]   all of this, especially to the people that he did it. Considering just a few months ago,
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.160]   they gathered together and got their money together, and during their break, had a baby
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:43.640]   shower for him. And those are the people that he shot up. So, when we find the details of
[00:30:43.640 --> 00:30:50.880]   the background behind what happened, it makes his horrendous act even that much more horrendous.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:31:00.320]   Scripture tells us that the law came to make sin utterly sinful, to reveal to us just exactly
[00:31:00.320 --> 00:31:06.880]   what you and I were deserving of. You know, when we first become Christians, we say, "Oh,
[00:31:06.880 --> 00:31:12.960]   thank God Jesus loved me, and I'm a sinner." But the more we dig, the more we understand
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:19.320]   the law, the more we understand who God is, the more we come to grips with exactly what
[00:31:19.320 --> 00:31:25.600]   he did on the cross. You may have at one point said, "Thank God for Jesus. Thank God for
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:30.160]   him on the cross." But the sanctification, part of our spiritual maturity, and why the
[00:31:30.160 --> 00:31:36.960]   blessing of having the Word of God, is because the Word of God reveals to us just how sinful
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:44.520]   we really were. And it is in that backdrop that God's love is displayed. So, when the
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.480]   Scripture says in Romans 5a, God demonstrates his own love toward us, in that while we were
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:55.760]   yet sinners. See, the study of the Scriptures gives us a deeper understanding of what that
[00:31:55.760 --> 00:32:01.280]   means, "yet sinners." It's one thing for us to see, it's like, "Oh yeah, you know, we did
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.400]   what we shouldn't have done. Oh, there's a bunch of things that we should have done that
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:10.720]   we didn't do." But it's another thing to understand, just like this man, that the people that he
[00:32:10.720 --> 00:32:14.960]   killed, not only were they his co-workers, but these are the people who poured love into
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:20.280]   their life for their child, just a few months ago. And then you just recognize just the
[00:32:20.280 --> 00:32:28.760]   utter depravity of his heart to do something like that. See, when we examine the Gospel,
[00:32:28.760 --> 00:32:34.240]   when we examine the nature of our God, when we examine the nature of our sin, and God,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:39.960]   like a physician, you know, with an x-ray, and just digging deeply, seeing how deep this
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:48.560]   problem goes, the more the cross begins to shine. And here's the response to that, that
[00:32:48.560 --> 00:32:52.680]   leads to the third question. Well, if that's the case, if our unrighteousness leads to
[00:32:52.680 --> 00:32:58.960]   greater glory to His name, again, serves to show, if our unrighteousness serves to show
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:02.440]   His righteousness of God, what shall we say? That God is unrighteous, that He inflicts
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:08.360]   wrath on us? And then he continues in verse 7, "But through my lie God's truth abounds
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:13.040]   to His glory. Why am I still being condemned as a sinner? And why not do evil that good
[00:33:13.040 --> 00:33:19.680]   may come?" If that's the case, if the law comes to make sin utterly sinful, why am I
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:25.360]   being condemned? Because God's using my sin to glorify Himself. Should we sin that God's
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:32.040]   goodness may abound more, as some people slanderously were charging us with saying? Their condemnation
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:36.240]   is just. See, these Judaizers couldn't understand what Paul was saying. He's saying, like, if
[00:33:36.240 --> 00:33:42.720]   salvation is by grace, if God came to forgive us of our sins, then are you saying that we
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:47.200]   should continue to sin, that God's glory may be magnified that much more? And he says,
[00:33:47.200 --> 00:33:53.160]   "Of course not. By no means." How can your thought possibly go that direction? Again,
[00:33:53.160 --> 00:33:58.120]   in Romans 6, 1-4, he makes this very clear. He asks the same question, "What shall we
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:05.080]   say then? Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound? By no means. How can we who die
[00:34:05.080 --> 00:34:10.600]   to sin still live in it? Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.120]   Jesus were baptized into death? We were buried, therefore, with Him by baptism into death,
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:20.120]   in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:26.680]   might walk in the newness of life." The whole reason why Jesus Christ died and was crucified
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:31.800]   for us is so that He may make us new creatures and save us from this sin, this empty way
[00:34:31.800 --> 00:34:38.720]   of life. So how can you possibly think that by God saving us by grace, gives us license
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:46.400]   to sin? "By no means." Again, verse 15 and 16, "What then? Are we to sin because we are
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:52.280]   under the law, not under the law, but under grace?" Let me stop right there for a second.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:56.920]   I don't know how many conversations I've had with somebody saying almost exactly the same
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.240]   thing. "We're not under the law. Stop preaching about what we should do because we're not
[00:35:02.240 --> 00:35:07.760]   under the law. Stop making us feel guilty, you know, because we've been set free. We're
[00:35:07.760 --> 00:35:14.320]   not under the law. We're under grace. So because we're under grace, we shouldn't feel guilty.
[00:35:14.320 --> 00:35:22.680]   We have the freedom to live any way that we want." He says his answer to that question,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:30.040]   "By no means." If that's your logical conclusion to the grace of God, "By no means." Do you
[00:35:30.040 --> 00:35:35.120]   not know that if you present yourself to anyone as disobedient slaves, you are slaves to the
[00:35:35.120 --> 00:35:41.480]   one whom you obey, either of sin, which leads to death, or obedience, which leads to righteousness.
[00:35:41.480 --> 00:35:49.320]   In other words, if your understanding of the grace of God leads you to live in sin, you
[00:35:49.320 --> 00:35:53.480]   haven't been set free. That is evident that you are still bound to sin. And he's going
[00:35:53.480 --> 00:35:57.520]   to exposit that when we get to chapter 6, what it means to be a slave to sin, what it
[00:35:57.520 --> 00:36:00.960]   means to be a slave to righteousness. We'll get to that when we get to chapter 6. I'm
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.640]   not sure when we're going to get there, but we'll get there, right? But he says, "If your
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:11.880]   thinking leads, because we're saved by grace, that I can kind of live in freedom," again,
[00:36:11.880 --> 00:36:18.320]   using the misuse of the term "Christian liberty." So liberty basically means I'm free to enjoy
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:26.600]   life as I please. But he says, "By no means." If you live to gratify the flesh, you are
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:35.280]   a slave to your flesh. You are not set free. Let me make this absolutely crystal clear.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:42.280]   Any movement of God, any revival of God that focuses on one aspect of God without the other
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:50.200]   is not God's movement. Because God does not contradict himself. Any movement that emphasizes
[00:36:50.200 --> 00:36:56.560]   grace and does not emphasize His holiness is not a movement of God. Because God will
[00:36:56.560 --> 00:37:02.440]   not contradict Himself. He is faithful to all His promises. He is faithful to who He
[00:37:02.440 --> 00:37:10.480]   is. Now let me give you an example of a wrong application of grace, which sometimes, if
[00:37:10.480 --> 00:37:16.720]   we're not careful, this is usually how our logic goes. I hear people say things like,
[00:37:16.720 --> 00:37:21.960]   and again as an example, "My mom is so gracious and loving, and no matter what I do, she's
[00:37:21.960 --> 00:37:27.840]   always accepting. I'm so thankful that my mom is so gracious. She sacrificed so much
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:35.960]   for me. She got two jobs, three jobs, so that I can have a good life. Thank God." And then
[00:37:35.960 --> 00:37:39.200]   your friend says, "Hey, shouldn't we go home? Your mom's waiting for you." "No, no, no.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:45.760]   Don't worry. My mom's so gracious. You don't know what my mom is. My mom works three jobs
[00:37:45.760 --> 00:37:51.560]   so that I can have a good life. She's so gracious." "Well, isn't she waiting for you at home?
[00:37:51.560 --> 00:37:58.720]   Didn't she tell you to come home at 10 o'clock?" "Didn't you hear what I said? My mom is gracious.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:04.120]   She's not going to punish me because she loves me so much. She is so gracious." It's like,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:10.000]   "Well, yeah, but she told you to come home at 10." "I know, but she's so gracious." That's
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:16.360]   the wrong application of the grace of God. Wouldn't you say? Wouldn't you say, with somebody
[00:38:16.360 --> 00:38:20.080]   saying like, "Oh, because my God is so gracious, and he saved me because of his grace, and
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:26.280]   we have Christian liberty, so let's be free." How is that any different? See, the right
[00:38:26.280 --> 00:38:34.000]   response to the grace of God is recognizing, considering what my mom has done, I want to
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:40.240]   please her even more. She told me to come home at 10. I want to get up there earlier.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:44.160]   What can I do to possibly show her how much appreciation I have for what she has done
[00:38:44.160 --> 00:38:51.280]   for me? How can I live a holier life so that I can honor God and to show him my appreciation
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.080]   for what he's done? How can I sacrifice? How can I give? How can I love like he is loved?
[00:38:56.080 --> 00:39:03.700]   How can I live holy like he is holy? You see, those two responses are kind of responses
[00:39:03.700 --> 00:39:11.040]   that people have. And you have one saying, "No, we're saved by grace." And any talk
[00:39:11.040 --> 00:39:17.680]   of any kind of rules or any challenge, you say, "You're nullifying the grace of God."
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:25.320]   No. It is because of the grace of God, we strive for holiness that much more. It's because
[00:39:25.320 --> 00:39:32.280]   God's been gracious, we pursue holiness. He says, "God is love, so we must love." God
[00:39:32.280 --> 00:39:41.840]   is holy, so what? Be holy. His grace doesn't nullify our requirement to be holy. It actually
[00:39:41.840 --> 00:39:48.560]   accentuates it that much more. His love and grace and his mercy, his unconditional sacrifice
[00:39:48.560 --> 00:39:58.720]   that he's given us is a grounds to passionately pursue him more, not less. And isn't that
[00:39:58.720 --> 00:40:04.960]   what the author of Hebrews is saying? Considering this great mercy to offer your bodies as a
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.680]   living sacrifice where before his sacrifice, you did it to think that you were somehow
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:16.000]   going to earn his love, but considering what he has given, considering what you and I confess
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:23.080]   that we have received, now live up to the calling that you have been given. Live up
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   to the gospel of Jesus Christ. Live up to that grace that you've been given. See, that's
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:31.200]   what Paul is trying to argue. They're saying like, you're trying to nullify the grace of
[00:40:31.200 --> 00:40:36.240]   God by saying that if you keep saying this, that people are going to live licentiously.
[00:40:36.240 --> 00:40:41.000]   No. Yes, some who do not know the grace of God, who are going to pervert the grace of
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.800]   God, and they're going to receive it like a spoiled brat. It's like, "Oh, my mom is
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.120]   lovely. She forgives. Don't worry, we're not going to be punished. She says 10, but it
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:54.920]   doesn't matter. God doesn't punish. He doesn't punish us. I can just do whatever I want."
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:41:05.080]   Then I can say, "At minimum, that person is a spoiled brat." Okay? If that offended you,
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:10.300]   it should, okay? Because I meant to offend you, okay? Because if that's the response
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.720]   of the grace of God, we're spoiled brats. That's exactly what we're doing. God is gracious,
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:19.840]   so I can do whatever I want, and anybody who tells me otherwise is perverting my mom's
[00:41:19.840 --> 00:41:26.620]   love. It's like, "No, you're perverting your mom's love." Possible second is actually even
[00:41:26.620 --> 00:41:32.760]   more offensive, that you don't really know the grace of God. You've never really been
[00:41:32.760 --> 00:41:40.160]   affected by the grace of God, and that's why you don't have any personal affection for
[00:41:40.160 --> 00:41:49.560]   the grace of God. See, a true response to the gospel of Jesus Christ would lead us to
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:59.480]   repent. It would melt us. Yesterday, I wasn't kidding when Susie and Eugene was doing a
[00:41:59.480 --> 00:42:03.800]   feet washing ceremony. I was like, "Okay, it's going to be a little bit awkward. There's
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:07.280]   a lot of non-Christians here, and they don't know what it is." Even among Christians, I
[00:42:07.280 --> 00:42:12.320]   haven't seen that done before, at least not in a wedding. It was so beautiful. The whole
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.960]   time that they were doing that, I was thinking, "Jesus did this as a last thing before he
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:22.620]   went to the cross." Last thing. I mean, he's going to go to the cross. He's going to sacrifice
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:29.720]   for sins for people that don't deserve it. And the last thing he did was he humbled himself
[00:42:29.720 --> 00:42:37.640]   and became nothing. Serving them, washing their dirty, filthy feet. He didn't glorify
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:44.480]   himself. He emptied himself, became nothing. And the way he attracted his disciples is
[00:42:44.480 --> 00:42:52.040]   by serving us, by giving us more grace, by giving us more love. So that now when we remember
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:59.200]   Christ, it is not his fist. It is his love that attracts us. We're compelled by the love
[00:42:59.200 --> 00:43:05.160]   of Christ. And that's what real grace is. That's what gospel-centeredness really ought
[00:43:05.160 --> 00:43:12.660]   to be, is that we are so compelled by this love that we pursue holiness like we've never
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:18.900]   done before. We're broken like we've never been before. We're gracious like we've never
[00:43:18.900 --> 00:43:25.380]   been gracious before. And we love his word more than we've ever done before. Because
[00:43:25.380 --> 00:43:33.980]   we are drawn to the love of God like a magnet. And that's his faithfulness. His faithfulness
[00:43:33.980 --> 00:43:41.300]   is that he calls us to holiness by his grace. And if you get any part of that wrong, that's
[00:43:41.300 --> 00:43:48.420]   not a movement of God. No movement of God highlights his forgiveness without highlighting
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:54.580]   his holiness. Because God is faithful to himself. Would you take a minute to close your eyes
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:44:00.600]   and pray with me? And I know what we're talking about may be theology, may be just simple
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:07.600]   principles, but the application is absolutely crystal clear. God is faithful to everything
[00:44:07.600 --> 00:44:13.120]   that he has revealed in scripture. So what does that mean to us in application? That
[00:44:13.120 --> 00:44:19.980]   we need to be faithful to everything that he has set an example of. As he is faithful
[00:44:19.980 --> 00:44:24.160]   to his grace, we need to be faithful to his grace. As he is faithful to his holiness,
[00:44:24.160 --> 00:44:30.900]   we need to be faithful to his holiness. Anything less than that is not the gospel. Let's take
[00:44:30.900 --> 00:44:37.160]   a few minutes to come before the Lord in prayer. And honestly pray before God. Search me and
[00:44:37.160 --> 00:44:40.640]   know me. See if there's any hurtful ways in me. If there's anything that I have embraced
[00:44:40.640 --> 00:44:48.400]   or thought or projected for my selfish gain, instead of really seeking the truth, ask the
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:54.040]   Lord to reveal that in your heart. That we may continue to repent, continue to confess,
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:45:02.160]   and continue to have a deep and gracious and growing fellowship with our Lord. So let's
[00:45:02.160 --> 00:45:04.600]   take some time to pray as we come before the Lord in prayer.
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.180]   (upbeat music)
