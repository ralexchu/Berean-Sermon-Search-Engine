[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   I want to read to us a passage from John chapter 8.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   John chapter 8.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   And in this Jesus Christ is teaching, and this is what He says starting from verse 39.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   So just to get a context I'm going to start from 34 and read a lengthier passage.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   And it says this, "Jesus answered them, 'Truly, truly, I say to you, everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   The slave does not remain in the house forever, but the Son does remain forever.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   So if the Son makes you free, you will be free indeed.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   I know that you are Abraham's descendants, and you seek to kill me, because my word has no place in you.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   I speak the things which I have seen with my father, therefore you also do the things which you heard from your father.'
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   They answered and said to him, 'Abraham is our father.'
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   So Jesus said to them, 'If you are Abraham's children, do the deeds of Abraham.
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   But as it is, you are seeking to kill me, a man who has told you the truth, which I heard from God.
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   This Abraham did not do. You are doing the deeds of your father.'
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   Obviously they're upset and they say to him, 'We were not born of fornification.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   We have one father, God.'
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And Jesus said to them, 'If God were your father, you would love me, for I proceeded forth and have come from God.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   For I have not even come on my own initiative, but He sent me.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   Why do you not understand what I am saying?
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   It is because you cannot hear my words. You are of your father, the devil.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   He was a murderer from the beginning and does not stand in the truth, because there is no truth in him.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   For he is a liar and a father of lies.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   But because I speak the truth, you do not believe me.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   Which one of you convicts me of sin?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   If I speak truth, why do you not believe me?'
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   He who is of God hears the words of God.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   For this reason, you do not hear them, because you are not of God."
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Today, we're talking about this whole idea of, to which family line do you belong?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   If you are a child and a descendant, who are your ancestors?
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   More specifically, who is your father?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   And we think about that because that has a lot to do with our topic in relation to an aspect of our salvation,
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   which is going to be our adoption in Christ.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   Before we begin, let's pray and ask for the Lord's blessing.
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:59.000]   Father, we want to thank you again for your scripture.
[00:02:59.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   I pray, Lord, that as we are really digging deep into the details of what you have accomplished,
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   and we're digging deep into the kind of work you had to do,
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   how you declare us righteous, how you renew us in life,
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   how you foreordain, how you call, all these kind of things, Lord.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   All the more we get a more vivid picture of your great love for us, and so we thank you.
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   God, we want to pray, Lord, that as we tonight study the topic of adoption,
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   God, that our hearts would be encouraged,
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   but all the more, Lord, we would realize the weight, the weight of love,
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   the weight of responsibility, the weight of what you have given us, Lord.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This we pray in Christ's name, Amen.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   So, today we're talking about adoption.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Now, here's the thing is, regeneration again entails the giving of, basically, new life.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   You're being born again.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   You're being changed from that dead person who is lifeless and cannot respond, right?
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   Cannot respond at all, to being an individual who can respond to the call of the Spirit.
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   And then when we talked about justification, justification was the act of God where He pronounced you.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   He declared you.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   You standing before me as judge, you are guiltless.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Not only that, through Christ, you are righteous, right?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Now, adoption, some people will say, "No, adoption is not so much like an act of God.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   It's kind of like when we, in the beginning of this whole series, talked about ransom, talked about atonement.
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   These are big, broad strokes.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   Those are big categories of what God did in their salvation.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   So, someone says, "God adopted you."
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   They're talking about the totality of salvation.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   That's true.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   In one sense, that's true.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   But the reason why today we're talking about it in this process is because it definitely seems, okay, it definitely seems,
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   that this has both a chronological and a very specific act of God where He makes you His son, okay?
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   So, in theology, adoption will be basically an act of God whereby He makes us members of His family, okay?
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:23.000]   So, just think about that for a moment, alright?
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   To bring you to a point of salvation, not only does He foreordain, call, regenerate,
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and then He, or regenerate, calls, okay, justifies, and then He adopts you.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Now, the reason why I'm calling this part of the salvation, okay,
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   you might be thinking not so much like, "Oh, what is that really saving from?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   Is that actually saving from sin?"
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   And my basic argument is, look at what Jesus just said, okay?
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   In the passage that we just read in John chapter 8,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   our previous circumstance was a circumstance in which we were sons of God's enemy.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   We were members of the family, so to speak, okay, of the fallen angels.
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   That's weird to think about.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   But what I want to also highlight to you is when we read that passage,
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   Jesus Christ started speaking about how when Satan sins,
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   and when Satan lies, why does he do that?
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   It's because of his nature.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   He lies because he is a liar.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   That's what he says.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   The passage I want to point out to you again is verse 44.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   "You are of your father the devil, and you want to do the desires of your father.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   He was a murderer from the beginning, and does not stand in the truth
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   because there is no truth in him.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Whenever he speaks a lie, he speaks from his own nature."
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   That being the case, when the Scriptures views us prior to salvation,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   when the Scriptures sees us in our sinful state,
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   they call us children of wrath.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   If you look over at Ephesians 2, please turn your Bibles over there.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Ephesians 2, verse 2.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   I'm going to start reading actually from verse 1, and I'll go over to verse 3.
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   Ephesians 2, verse 1-3.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   It says, "And you are dead in your trespasses and sins,
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   in which you formerly walked according to the course of the world,
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   according to the prince of the power of the air,
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   according to the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Among them, we too all formerly lived in the lust of the flesh,
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   indulging the desire of the flesh and of the mind,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   and were by nature children of wrath."
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Now, I want you guys to take a very close look at what verse 2 is saying.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Notice how it says, "according to, and according to."
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   So your life was in accord with the prince of the power of the air, which is Satan.
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   And it says, "Your life was basically formerly in the pattern of this realm,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   you sons of disobedience."
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   What do we need saving from?
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   Is this act just one of those benefits that come from God already saving us?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   What is adoption?
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Well, it gives us a better picture of what adoption is,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   when we realize which family we belong to.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   When we realize what kind of circumstance and situation
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   were ours in reality, in spiritual reality.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Here's another verse.
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Jump over to chapter 5 of Ephesians, verse 6.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   Okay?
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   Chapter 5, verse 6.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   And he says, "Let no one deceive you with empty words,
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   for because of these things the wrath of God comes upon the sons of disobedience.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   Therefore do not be partakers with them, for you were formerly darkness,
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   but now you are light in the world.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Walk as children of light."
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   You see these words being used very frequently now.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   Okay?
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   It's not just one reference, it's a bunch.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   You were sons of disobedience previously.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You were the sons of the darkness.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   You were in it.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   You were the darkness.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   You know, that's what it's really trying to push in there.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   But now you are the light.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   You by nature have become different.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   Alright?
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   And so, the beautiful truth of the scriptures,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   the beautiful truth of the gospel message,
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   is that now in Christ, we have adoptions of sons.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   And let's go to some of these passages.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   Look at John 1, chapter 12.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Oh, sorry.
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   John chapter 1, verse 12.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   And it says, "But to all who received it, who believed in His name,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   He gave the power," and in some of your chapters it'll say,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   "The right to become children of God."
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:51.000]   Alright?
[00:09:51.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   He gave you this right.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   I want you to just think for a moment.
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   Okay?
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   Just think for a moment.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.000]   I recently read an article about how Bill Gates actually turns out to be a really, really good guy.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Out of his--at one time he had somewhere close to $56 billion.
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   Well, he's donated about $34 billion of that.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:18.000]   Supposedly 500 million children have been saved from malaria
[00:10:18.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   because he's created devices that'll kill mosquitoes on the spot with a blue laser.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   He's done basically humanitarian work all over the globe.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   This guy has bought like literature and material to just pass out to people things that were copyrighted
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   and he thinks it's good for education.
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   What he'll do is he'll buy the entire patent or copyright and he'll pass it down.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   Well, do you know why I'm talking about this?
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Because there's a sense in which I'm like, "Man, I wish I could be like him one day." Right?
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   But then there's another part.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   Let me just post you a hypothetical scenario.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   There's another part where in the article it said he was going to give only $10 million to his children.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   But obviously they have resources and access to all that he's built.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   But he said, "I want to raise my children in a way where they're going to at least still have to make their own way."
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:07.000]   I'm like, "$10 million? I would like to be your child."
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   "I'll have to make my own way."
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "Oh, make my own way. Suffer with $10 million."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   [laughter]
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   But the question is, I mean, that guy seems really like a humanitarian.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   He seems in many ways principled.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   Can I become his child?
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   Can I ask him and be like, "You know, Mr. Gates, I read an article about you and I thought it was spectacular what you're doing.
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   Would you take me into your house?"
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   Obviously the right, right? The right or the power to become his child is nothing you just, you know, take for yourself.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   It's nothing you just walk up to his house and say, "I would like to be your son."
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   This is to those who believe that you have that right.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   Romans 8, verse 14-17.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:06.000]   "For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God."
[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   Well, these are sons of God, yeah.
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "For you have not received the spirit of slavery leading to the fear again,
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   The Spirit Himself testifies with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   And if children, this is His logic, okay?
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   If children, heirs also, heirs of God, fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   indeed we suffer with Him so that we might be glorified with Him.
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   His logic is so sound.
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   He gave us the right to be children and the Spirit confirms that we are children.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   But if we are then His children, then we are heirs.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   What do you think of when you automatically think heirs?
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:54.000]   He is heir to the throne, authority.
[00:12:54.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   He is an heir, meaning He is going to have the inheritance.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   He is going to have, and He says, the glory.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:07.000]   Who are we that we should be having the glory of Christ, the only Son of God?
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   Who are we that we should have the inheritance of God?
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Who are we that Christ would share any of that with us?
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   I can imagine now, if it so happened, it would be ridiculous.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   But if it so happened that Bill Gates walked in here, he looked at all of us and he said,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   "Oh my gosh, you guys are so wonderful. I'm going to make you all children."
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   What do you think his children would say? His actual, real children?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Right? Have you ever thought about that?
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   But the idea is, we share in the inheritance.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   We share in the inheritance.
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   And so, what we see just from that one thing is we just realize,
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   "Wow, that's not just like a nice transition we have there,
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   going from kingdom of darkness to the kingdom of light.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   That is one of these, from the pits of where Satan belongs,
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   to the heights of where Christ belongs.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   This transition from adoption where you're formerly children of wrath,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   sons of disobedience, now to heirs of the glory of Christ.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It's like, "What in the world? This is just mind-blowing."
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   And so, what we want to talk about are the benefits, the privileges.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   The privileges and the benefits of being called the Son of God.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   First, or number two on your packet, it says this,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   the privilege is adoption.
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   Adoption allows us to be able to speak to God as our good and loving Father.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Did you guys notice in that previous passage, in verse 15 of Romans chapter 8,
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   it says that we receive the spirit of adoption as sons by which we cry out,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   "Abba! Father!" Right?
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   And if you guys know the context of chapter 8,
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   there is this great agony amongst the people,
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:55.000]   and there is an element of suffering,
[00:14:55.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   and there is an element then of encouragement saying,
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   "Hey, all the suffering and all these things seem light compared to the glory of Christ,
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   the weight of glory that is going to await us."
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   And this is in the midst of basically these sons then going through suffering
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   and being able to cry out,
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   "God, help me. Abba! Father! I need your help."
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   This is a beautiful picture.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Here's another passage in Galatians chapter 4, verse 1 through 7.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:26.000]   Can you guys string your Bibles there?
[00:15:26.000 --> 00:15:33.000]   It's a really important passage for us to go to.
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Galatians chapter 4.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   Do you want to read to us? Verses 1 through 7.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   And it says, "Now I say, as long as the heir is a child,
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   he does not differ at all from a slave, although he is owner of everything.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.000]   For he is under guardians and managers until the date set by the father.
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   So also we, while we were children, were held in bondage under the elemental things of the world.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   But when the fullness of the time came, God set forth His Son,
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   born of a woman, born under the law,
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   so that He might redeem those who are under the law,
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   that we might receive the adoption as sons.
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   Because you are sons, God has set forth the spirit of His Son into our hearts crying,
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   "Abba! Father!"
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And if a son, then an heir through God."
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:26.000]   Pretty cool passage, right?
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   And as you guys might have heard before, that term,
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   you know, when that term "Abba", when it comes out "Abba",
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   what's really interesting is in the Aramaic word.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:42.000]   And you guys have probably heard this before, but I think it's good for us to really review.
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   What kind of term is that?
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   See, because there are passages like when Jesus teaches us to pray,
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   as a disciple, He says, "Pray, 'Our Father who art in heaven.'"
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   Well, what's the difference between "Father", "Pater", and this word "Abba"?
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   And you can already tell just from the sound of it.
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   How old, when you think of the word "Abba", how old do you think, you know,
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   the person who's speaking, how old do you think, when you picture that,
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   how old do you think or imagine they would be?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   You would think of an adolescent, you would think of a child, right?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   Where young kids, like the kids that we have at church, running around,
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   "Abba, Abba, Abba", you know?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Running around, calling intimately, because that's really the term.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And then I remember, because I don't have kids that are a bit older,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   but Pastor Peter's kids are a little older, so I'll use them as analogies.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   But what's really funny is, you know, some of the Pastor Peter's children,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   they're already in high school and whatnot, but then,
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:50.000]   they still call Pastor Peter "Daddy", you know?
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   And I remember Pastor Peter told me, one of them, I'm not going to say who,
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   but one of them tried to be like, "Hey, Dad."
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   And he was like, "What? I'm still Daddy to you."
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   Why? Because he didn't want to lose the sense of intimacy.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So for us, when we think it is a privilege to be able to call God our Abba Father,
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   in just the way in which, for us, it's a privilege to have a Father who we are intimate with.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   Now, as I look at the room, I know some of you guys in life don't know what that looks like,
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   because you just don't have a close relationship with your Dad.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   But we can understand what that is.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Even from a lack, we can understand what a privilege it would be
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:36.000]   to have a Father in which you are so intimate,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   and where you can call Him because you're close.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   You can seek Him when you need help because you know He cares.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   You can go to Him because you know He's willing to give you His ear,
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   He's willing to give you His time,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   and He's willing to play that role of a caring Father
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   who's going to do all the things of protect, nurture, discipline, guide, teach.
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   In that way, we have this privilege to be able to call God our Abba Father.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   So it's a drastic shift.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   And I think this is pretty amazing because I believe that for us,
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   God as our intimate Abba Father is the primary way we should be thinking about God.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   Now it's like, "Whoa, but God is also our Creator,
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   God is also our Judge, He is our Master and Lord as we are His servants and slaves,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   He's the King and we are His peasants, so to speak, His citizens."
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:34.000]   But here's the thing, in my mind, just like again,
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   I think about the kind of relationships that we have,
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:43.000]   I really think that the Father-Son relationship is the one
[00:19:43.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   that should be the primary distinguishing relationship we have with our God.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Why?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Because for example, I'm a pastor, right?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   And as my son is in a nursery and I'm the pastor over the education department,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   guess what, I'm also his pastor.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   Does that have my primary relationship?
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   No.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   Right?
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   You could have a dad who happens to be a judge.
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:11.000]   You could have a dad who happens to be a prosecutor.
[00:20:11.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   You could have a judge who happens to, I mean, you could have a father,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   like some of our kids do, whose dad is a police officer, a fireman.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   But as a police officer, he's in a position of authority,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   but is that the primary way the children relate to the Father?
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   No.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.000]   The primary way is the family relationship of God as our Father.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   So what a privilege that is.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   What a privilege that is.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   Moving forward, this communicates by God deciding to adopt,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   by God saying, "I give you the right to become my children."
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   That act of God transferring you from the realm of Satan to now His kingdom of light.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   That shows us and communicates to us God's love.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Take a look at Psalm 103, verses 13 through 14.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And it says this, "As a father has compassion on his children,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   For He knows how we are formed.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:16.000]   He remembers that we are dust."
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Let's look at another passage.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   This is Jesus' word, "Therefore do not be anxious, saying,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   'What shall we eat?' or 'What shall we drink?' or 'What shall we wear?'
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   For the Gentiles seek after all these things,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   but our Heavenly Father knows that you need them all."
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   He knows.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   What is the cure for your anxiety and fear?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   What is the cure for when you're sitting there having panic attacks,
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   "Oh my gosh, if I don't get this job, I'm going to die,"
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   or "Oh my gosh, if I don't pass this grade."
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   What is the cure?
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   It says, "The cure is, if you are a disciple of God,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:56.000]   your life is in such a condition where you can be assured
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   God already knows the needs that you have."
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   Right?
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   That's the cure.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   Here's another one, "Ask and it will be given to you.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   Seek and you will find.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:07.000]   Knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   For everyone who asks receives, and the one who seeks finds,
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and the one who knocks, it will be opened.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   For which one of you, if his son asks him for bread,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   will give him a stone?
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   Or if he asks for a fish, who will give him a serpent?
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   If you then, who are evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   how much more will your Father who is in Heaven give good things
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   to those who ask Him?"
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   Right?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   So the contrast, obviously, is like,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   look, you here on Earth, you men,
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   simply try to do your best to take care of your kids.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   And even though you guys are selfish, wicked,
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   you guys are in the flesh,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:50.000]   when your kid asks for food, you care for him,
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and you meet his needs.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   How much more than the all-powerful, all-knowing, all-loving God
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   would He take care of us?
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   1 John 3, 1-2, "See how great a love the Father has bestowed on us,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   that we would be called children of God, and such we are.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   For this reason the world does not know us,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   because it did not know Him, beloved.
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Now we are children of God.
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   It has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:18.000]   We know that when He appears, we will be like Him,
[00:23:18.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   because we will see Him just as He is."
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   Pretty cool passage.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   Now I want us to go over to Hebrews chapter 12, verses 5-11.
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses 5-11.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   And I have Johnny Booth, Reverend Booth.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   Just kidding.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   No, really, it's because earlier he was standing here,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   but he had a suit, and then so he looked like this.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Okay.
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   Can you read verses 5-11, please?
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   "And have you forgotten the exhortation that addresses you as sons?
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord,
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   nor be weary when you prove by Him.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:06.000]   For the Lord disciplines the one He loves,
[00:24:06.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   and chastises every son whom He receives.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   It is for discipline that you have to endure.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   God is treating you as sons.
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   If you are left without discipline, in which all have participated,
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   then you are illegitimate children and not sons.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:29.000]   Besides this, we have had earthly fathers who disciplined us,
[00:24:29.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   and we respected them.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   Shall we not much more be subject to the father of spirits and live?
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   For they discipline us for a short time, as it seemed best to them.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   But He disciplines us for our good, that we may share His holiness.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   For the moment, all discipline seems painful, rather than pleasant.
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   But later it yields the peaceful fruit of righteousness
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   to those who have been trained by it.
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:57.000]   So you guys see the point of this passage.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:03.000]   He says, when God is disciplining you, He is treating you as a son.
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   In my mind, when I read Proverbs, Proverbs teaches this,
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   that he who spares a rod hates his child, hates his son.
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Why? Because discipline is difficult.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Discipline is unpleasant.
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   Discipline makes me risk the affection I have for my son.
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Right?
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   And so people who are selfish, people who don't care enough for the child,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   are not going to do it.
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   I don't want to do that, it's too tough.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   But if I care for you, if I love you, if I really, really love you
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   to the degree that I'm willing to do anything, no matter how hard,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   to seek your good, to save you from flaw, to save you from sin,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   to save you from that which is going to ultimately hurt you,
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   then I'm going to do it.
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:54.000]   And this passage says, hey, remember when God is disciplining you,
[00:25:54.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   He is treating you like a legitimate son.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   And if He doesn't, if He says, just do whatever you want,
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:03.000]   that just means you're not a son.
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   Right?
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   That's what the passage is saying.
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   So again, the point being, this is for our good.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   God as our Heavenly Father is loving us, and in my mind, as He loves us,
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He is always seeking our good.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   Amen.
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Let's move forward.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   Adoption allows us to be heirs with Christ.
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:26.000]   Okay?
[00:26:26.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Adoption allows us to be heirs with Christ.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   So the idea here is just a simple one, so we're going to go through it pretty quickly.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Just that there is a unique fellowship with Christ.
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:40.000]   If you've been basically brought into the household of God,
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   you've got to imagine, there is just kind of --
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   there is obviously straight up like awkwardness.
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   You know, as I think about that scenario,
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   there would be awkwardness from the beginning.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   Right?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:56.000]   But nonetheless, by Him bringing us into the family,
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:26:58.000]   and Christ being the Son of God,
[00:26:58.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   there's going to be now this unique, intimate fellowship with Christ.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Right?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   And so that's why in the Scriptures it talks about you share in His suffering,
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   you share in His glory, you share in basically His everything.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   Later on in Heaven, you share in His authority, you share on His throne, you share the love, you share everything.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   That is a unique privilege granted to nobody else.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   No angels.
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:26.000]   Right?
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:28.000]   No other creature of God.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   Why is it that big old lion?
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   It's like, "Hey, God used you as an analogy for me.
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   I'm going to make you, you know, kind of like my best pal, my companion."
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Or an angel, Michael the archangel.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Right?
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   Or Gabriel, the one that God sends and uses as a messenger.
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   Why not have those individuals be in the family of God, heirs with Christ?
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   I don't know.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   It's just a unique privilege that only comes through this adoption.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   And so, if you notice these other passages, basically it's saying,
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   that you have as heir with Christ, you have a unique fellowship,
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   and that you share both the suffering, the subsequent glory, and the inheritance that is kept for you.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:15.000]   Moving forward, adoption allows us to be one family as a whole then too.
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   So anybody who, across the board, not just in the local church setting that we call us,
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   hey, brothers and sisters, but we call anybody in the universal family of God, the church of God, right?
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   Saying, "Brother" or "Sister."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   And that is a unique privilege.
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   Romans chapter 9, verse 7 through 8, it says,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   "But it is not as though the word of God has failed, for they are not all Israel who are descended from Israel.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:41.000]   Nor are they all children, because they are Abraham's descendants.
[00:28:41.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   But, through Isaac, your descendants will be made.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   That is, it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God,
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   but the children of the promise are regarded as descendants."
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   Okay?
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   And so basically, I have a list of passages there, and I'm just going to read a couple other ones.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:03.000]   Please go down to letter I, Galatians chapter 6, verse 10.
[00:29:03.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   And it says, "So then, as we have opportunity, let us do good to everyone,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   and especially those who are of the household of faith."
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   Ephesians 2, 19, "So then, you are no longer strangers and aliens, but you are fellow citizens with the saints,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   and members of the household of God."
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   Right?
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:26.000]   Members of the household of God.
[00:29:26.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Now, I want you to think about that for a moment, because, in our culture, again,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   the household is at very, very, very dire risk.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.000]   Okay?
[00:29:36.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   Broken homes, way too many of them.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   So, the analogy doesn't hit us like it would if we were in the early first century.
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   Right?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:48.000]   Where family was everything.
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   It's kind of like if you watch the movie Braveheart, and then you meet a big guy.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   Your first question is, "Which clan are you from?"
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Right?
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   "I'm from the McLeods."
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   You basically say, "Oh, you know, the McLeods."
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   If we were back in the first century, if I said, "Hey, what do you think about this young lady for this young man?"
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   They would know each other's families.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   "Well, he comes from this dad, and this parents, and basically the families would know each other."
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   They would already know what kind of reputable guy that is.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   Right?
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   Family was like everything back then.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   But in our day and age, family is like, "Hey, we've got a family to get together later this month."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:29.000]   "Ah, it's going to be too complicated.
[00:30:29.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   Too much money."
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   And then it's like nothing.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   I feel like that's how it is nowadays, you know?
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   But back then, family was in essence their value of their own self-worth.
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   If their family did well, they felt happy.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   So, the well-being, not just of you, the individual, but the well-being of the family, equated to the person's happiness.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.000]   Right?
[00:30:51.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   And the family bonds were so strong.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:55.000]   So strong.
[00:30:55.000 --> 00:31:03.000]   And you think about that, and then the scriptures say, "You, and you, and you, as now you are members of the household of God."
[00:31:03.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   Right?
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   You ought to know how you need to behave then as a family.
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:09.000]   You ought to know how you treat your brothers and sisters.
[00:31:09.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   And so there's a passage here, 1 Timothy.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:17.000]   If you ever read 1 Timothy and Titus, it'll start talking about how, yeah, show respect to the older people.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   And it says, "Don't really be an older man, but treat them like a father."
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   Right?
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   And then amongst the sisters, like if there's a woman, like treat her like a sister.
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:30.000]   And it just keeps on going about how basically in the church, you need to function like a family.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   Okay?
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   This is a privilege that comes from the adoption.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   Our adoption as sons of God.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Now by way of application for us, by way of application for us, a couple things here.
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   Okay?
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   One, God expects us to be imitators of our Father, of our God.
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Okay?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   If you notice here in Ephesians chapter 5 verse 1, that's number 1 underneath there, under the application section in your packet.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   It says, "We are to imitate our Father in heaven in all our conduct."
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Paul says, "Be imitators of God as beloved children."
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   Okay? "As beloved children, be imitators of God."
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   And then Peter echoes this theme when he says, "As obedient children, do not be conformed to the passions of your former inmates.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   But as He who called you is holy, be holy yourselves in all your conduct.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   Since it is written, 'You shall be holy, for I am holy.'"
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   And if you refer back to John chapter 8, when Jesus is talking to these individuals who took pride in the fact that
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   our Father is Abraham, and then Jesus' words were, "But Abraham never did what you did."
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   If you really are sons of Abraham, do the deeds of Abraham.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:32:56.000]   Right?
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   Likewise, if you really are the son of God, not the son of God, sorry.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:09.000]   If you really are children of God, if you really are individuals adopted into His family,
[00:33:09.000 --> 00:33:12.000]   why would you still act like you belong to another family?
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   If you went from being a park to a limb, why behave like still you're functioning underneath the authority of the parks?
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:25.000]   I say that because my wife's maiden name is Park.
[00:33:25.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   I believe, you know, before she married me, there's a sense in which her father as a man of the house had a big sense of authority.
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   Right?
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   But now that I have, what, been married to her, now that she is a limb,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:45.000]   there's an automatic sense in which no longer does she function, no longer does she seek the approval,
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:51.000]   no longer does she go under the leadership of the man of that house, now she is under the leadership of the man of this house.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   Likewise, when a child is under the leadership of one house to another,
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   why would you still function like you're still trying to approve of what Satan is doing?
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   Automatic, like, absolute nonsense, right?
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   So the idea is that we need to, we need to imitate our father as children of God.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   Right?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   But next, basically, the scriptures tell us that because our father, right, is God, we need to boast in Him.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   Now I use the words, we need to glorify Him.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   But look at what all these passages say.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   So this, I don't know how to phrase this point really well.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   It's one of those points where just, you're reading some of these things and there's a lot of passages about this.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   So, these are just a sampling actually.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   But let me have some of you guys read this a little bit.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Jason, can you read out from your packet, the first one, Matthew 5, 16?
[00:34:50.000 --> 00:34:52.000]   (Pause)
[00:34:52.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   "When we walk in the paths of righteous conduct," is that what you're referring to?
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Yep.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:11.000]   "Our Heavenly Father, and bring glory to Him when we act in a way that is pleasing to God,
[00:35:11.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   we are to do so that others may see your good works and give glory to your Father who is in Heaven."
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:18.000]   Okay.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   "As Paul encourages Philippians to maintain pure conduct before unbelievers,
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   that you may be blameless and innocent, children of God without blemish,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world."
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   Right?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   And it says this, "By this it may be seen who are the children of God and who are the children of the devil.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   Whoever does not do right is not of God, nor he who does not love his brother."
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Right?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   So, we end with this idea about what application of our adoption.
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   We need to be living in such a way where our boast is in God and the people that are basically viewing us are saying,
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   "Wow! Your Father is amazing!"
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.000]   Right?
[00:36:11.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   It's kind of like right now, you know, parents push their kids so much.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   I used to work at an after school academy and I had some kids that basically lived at that academy.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   They would come straight from school and they wouldn't leave until like 8pm, 8.30pm.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   I'm like, "Oh my gosh!" you know.
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   And then I realized basically none of these kids ask their parents like,
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   "Can I please go to academy 5 days a week?" you know.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   "Can I please go to after school program and skip dinner?"
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   None of them ask that.
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   What was happening is the parents were really just pushing and pushing.
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   And what I found prettiest, like just, not just astonishing but disheartening,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   was the fact that basically what the parents are doing is competing with each other through their children.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   What I create my child to be is going to reflect on me.
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Right?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   Which is pretty crazy.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Now in my mind, that's not good for them.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   It's not good for the parents, it's not good for the kids.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   But, however, I found I can see why they think like that.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Because even for me, as I was a teacher, if there was one crazy kid,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   automatically I'd look at the parent and be like, "Tsk, tsk, tsk, tsk."
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   Like, "What are you doing wrong at home?" you know.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:35.000]   But if I saw a really well-behaved, very obedient child, what do I think when I look at the parents?
[00:37:35.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   "What are you doing wrong at home? Like, how are you at home?" you know.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   And I found that kind of to be an interesting, you know, interesting thing.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   But here's my point.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   With us as adopted children of God,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   automatically by the way that people look at us, there is a reference to God.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   There is an automatic either blessing of the Lord, or there is going to be a glorifying of the Lord.
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   And the passage is clearly challenging us.
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   You then live in such a way that when people see your lives, they automatically say,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   "Wow! Your God is glorious."
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   Now by way of conclusion, I want to basically ask this question.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   So adoption again, we believe, is the act of God.
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   He is taking you from the, you know, again, previously, household of the fallen,
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.000]   and then He's bringing you into the household of God.
[00:38:32.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And in this, it's so different from regeneration, it's so different from justification,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   because the word comes to my mind again, this is so much more than redemption.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Okay? This is so much more than redemption.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   It is one thing for God to replace us where we originally were.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   It's like we did minus 10, and then He added 10, so we're now back at zero.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   That would be like setting things right.
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   That would be like caves starting over.
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   But adoption is so much more than redemption.
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   Because He could have regenerated us, justified us, and then just stopped.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   Now we'd be this given new life, and then we'd be given what?
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   Justification as in a standing before God?
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   But then He could have easily just made us servants of the angels.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   God made the angels servants of mankind,
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   but why couldn't have God just made us servants of the angels?
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   Why for eternity that we would be at the, you know, whims and wishes of the angels,
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   serving them, caring for them, watching over them.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   That could have easily been the case.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   So when you think about adoption, this is just so much more than just setting things right.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   It's so much more than just setting things to neutral and back to zero.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   It's so much more than redemption.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   So that's the lesson on adoption.
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   Is there any questions from the passages or the concept that we learned today?
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   Alright, well next week we're going to hit a very important topic about sanctification.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   Sanctification, okay?
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   Now, if you guys would please, that doesn't make any sense at all.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   What comes first? Question mark? Read this.
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   Cross out what comes first.
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Okay.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   I'm a little sick.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   And so my thinking has been kind of, "Woo!"
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   And then, just read your Bible passages, 2 Timothy 2 and then also 1 Thessalonians 4.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   But I want to give you guys a heads up that, you know,
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   that segment next week on sanctification is going to be pretty huge.
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   Because I definitely feel that there has been misconceptions about sanctification.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.000]   But also, for all of us in this room,
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   I look at this room and some of you guys I've been to church with for like a decade.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And, you know, we're going to have, basically, our lives living in the process of being sanctified.
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And so we have to study and kind of determine, what does God expect, right?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   What does God expect when He says, "I want you to be sanctified." Okay?
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   So, let me pray for us, close off, and you guys can have your time of discussion there.
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   Father God, we thank you and praise you.
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   Lord, I'm sure there are times God, um...
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   Oh man, um...
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Lord God, we are just thoroughly amazed.
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   And as we study this series of the salvation that you give us,
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   I think that God, you know, what really amazes us is that, truly, we can come to you as our Abba Father.
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   If you were nothing but a judge to us, we would be living in utter fear.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And if you were not our Father, but only the authority and King,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   then God would simply be your slaves who had no part in the inheritance of your household.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:31.000]   But God, to be now considered your sons, and to be able to come to you with every hurt and pain,
[00:42:31.000 --> 00:42:38.000]   come to you even when at our own fault and at our own selfishness and sin we make a mess,
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   but be able to come to you for forgiveness, be able to come to you for sanctification,
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:46.000]   to be able to come to you for help in the time of our need.
[00:42:46.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   What great grace is that, Lord?
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   How much love have you given us, God?
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:59.000]   So we want to thank you, Lord, and I pray that if any of us here are struggling to keep you as our first love,
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   struggling to keep you as the number one affection of our hearts,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   I pray that this study would have refreshed them.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   And I pray that throughout the week, Lord, they would be thinking about how they have a unique, unique privilege,
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   aside from the holy creatures of heaven, that God, we as simple men, would be now considered sons of God.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   We want to thank you again, it's in Christ that we pray.
