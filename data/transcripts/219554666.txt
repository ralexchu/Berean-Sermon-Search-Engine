[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.900]   All right, we're going to be looking at the three remaining churches of the seven churches
[00:00:12.900 --> 00:00:17.680]   in chapter three, the Church of Sardis, Philadelphia, and Laodicea.
[00:00:17.680 --> 00:00:21.160]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump in.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:23.660]   Gracious Father, we thank you for this afternoon.
[00:00:23.660 --> 00:00:29.480]   We pray, Father God, that we would be able to meet you through your word.
[00:00:29.480 --> 00:00:31.920]   Help us to hear your voice.
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.740]   We know, Father God, that ultimately we can only be fed, Father, when we're with you.
[00:00:36.740 --> 00:00:42.720]   So help us, Lord God, not to simply go through the motion, but this opportunity would be
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:48.880]   an opportunity for us to really seek you, to know you, to worship you, that we may continue
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.240]   to fall deeply in love with you.
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:56.560]   And we pray that you would anoint this time and that your word would be spoken, Father.
[00:00:56.560 --> 00:00:57.560]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:00:58.560]   Amen.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.960]   All right, so the remaining three churches, the Church of Sardis, so we're going to jump
[00:01:03.960 --> 00:01:07.640]   right into it because there's a lot of material.
[00:01:07.640 --> 00:01:13.800]   The Church of Sardis, again, every single one of these letters has different titles
[00:01:13.800 --> 00:01:19.760]   of Jesus that was mentioned in chapter one and is repeated and is related to what he
[00:01:19.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   has to say.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:23.920]   And this one is no different.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:28.400]   The first one is that Jesus is introduced to us as one who has seven spirits of God
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:31.280]   and the seven stars, right?
[00:01:31.280 --> 00:01:37.440]   And again, I'm not going to spend too much time here.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:38.440]   Can you see?
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.080]   I shouldn't have used the blue.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:42.080]   Can you see the blue?
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:43.760]   You can see it?
[00:01:43.760 --> 00:01:44.760]   Okay.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:45.760]   Next time I'll use a different color.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:47.440]   It seems like it's harder to see.
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:52.320]   Well, seven, obviously, you know, it represents the number completeness.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:57.480]   And in the previous chapter, it tells us that the seven stars, they represent the seven
[00:01:57.480 --> 00:02:00.000]   messengers or the seven different spirits.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:05.040]   And again, I'm not going to go too deep into that because basically it signifies God's
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:12.200]   sovereignty over the churches and what he's about to say.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:18.040]   This church, one of the harshest rebukes out of the seven, some of you might say that the
[00:02:18.040 --> 00:02:19.920]   harshest rebuke is to this church.
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:26.640]   I think the harshest rebuke is to the Laodicean church, but it's obviously debatable.
[00:02:26.640 --> 00:02:28.880]   It is one of the harshest rebukes.
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.680]   In fact, I don't think there's an argument that it's either between Laodicea and this
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.160]   particular church.
[00:02:34.160 --> 00:02:39.440]   And the reputation that they had was they were alive, but in reality, they were dead.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:44.440]   It says Jesus who walks among them, knows them intimately and not just their reputation.
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:49.000]   So we've been hearing over and over again, it's this Christ who is in the midst of them,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   right?
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.320]   That this is not a God who is far off and he's watching from a distance and say, "Hey,
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:55.920]   these guys are not behaving correctly."
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:59.080]   The scripture says that this is the body of Christ.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.760]   And the vision that John sees is that Jesus is in the midst of them.
[00:03:03.760 --> 00:03:10.200]   So again, obviously an application for us as a church that Christ, even though we can't
[00:03:10.200 --> 00:03:15.480]   physically see him, if we are his church, his presence is real among us.
[00:03:15.480 --> 00:03:20.720]   And so that's why he's able to say over and over again, "I know your deeds, right?
[00:03:20.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   I know what you're doing.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.120]   I know what your reputation is, but I know who you really are."
[00:03:24.120 --> 00:03:28.680]   And so he says, "Beyond the surface of reputation, this is how everybody else sees you, but this
[00:03:28.680 --> 00:03:30.180]   is who you really are.
[00:03:30.180 --> 00:03:34.280]   You have the reputation of being alive, but you're really dead."
[00:03:34.280 --> 00:03:40.080]   And it's, again, it kind of reminded me of the fig tree in Mark 11, verse 20, where Jesus
[00:03:40.080 --> 00:03:45.240]   sees it and he goes forward and thinking that there would be fruit and there's no fruit,
[00:03:45.240 --> 00:03:46.240]   right?
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:51.280]   It has an appearance of life, but in actuality, it was actually dead.
[00:03:51.280 --> 00:03:57.920]   In 1 Corinthians 10, 12, we are warned that when you think you stand, be careful because
[00:03:57.920 --> 00:03:59.400]   that's when you fall.
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:03.980]   And so the danger of this church was that they did not recognize where they were because
[00:04:03.980 --> 00:04:09.760]   they were believing their own reputation, because other people said this about them.
[00:04:09.760 --> 00:04:13.560]   And because maybe these people had particular titles or maybe they did something in the
[00:04:13.560 --> 00:04:16.760]   past or maybe they had a famous evangelist as a pastor.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:21.920]   I don't know why they had this reputation, but for whatever the reason, they believed
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:23.200]   it and they were unaware of it.
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   And so you have a reputation, but in reality, that's not who you are, right?
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:34.940]   But the only explanation that is given for why this church is dead is given in verse
[00:04:34.940 --> 00:04:37.600]   two, right?
[00:04:37.600 --> 00:04:40.520]   In verse two, it says, "Wake up and strengthen."
[00:04:40.520 --> 00:04:42.720]   No, this is...
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:46.600]   What is this?
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:53.320]   Okay, sorry.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:59.040]   In verse two, it says, "I have not found your work complete."
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:00.480]   Let's see how long it takes before...
[00:05:00.480 --> 00:05:02.080]   Oh, there you go.
[00:05:02.080 --> 00:05:03.080]   Okay.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.040]   So the only explanation given to us of why this church was dead and not alive is that
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:10.220]   their works were not complete.
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:13.000]   It doesn't mention about any particular heresy.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.720]   It doesn't talk about any particular sin that they're tolerating.
[00:05:16.720 --> 00:05:19.760]   It just says, "Your work is incomplete."
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:24.880]   You started this work, but you haven't completed it.
[00:05:24.880 --> 00:05:28.060]   It kind of reminds us of the book of Haggai.
[00:05:28.060 --> 00:05:33.320]   Some of you guys who may know the book of Haggai, the book of Haggai is written where
[00:05:33.320 --> 00:05:39.320]   God calls this man, Haggai, to prophesy against the nation of Israel because 16 years prior
[00:05:39.320 --> 00:05:44.200]   to Haggai's ministry, God basically allowed the nation of Israel to come back and rebuild
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:45.940]   the temple.
[00:05:45.940 --> 00:05:50.680]   And when they came back, they were met with some resistance from the Samaritans.
[00:05:50.680 --> 00:05:56.800]   And because it was difficult, they weren't received with fanfare and there was opposition,
[00:05:56.800 --> 00:05:58.680]   so it became very difficult.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:03.080]   And every time they would try to build the temple, there would be these antagonists,
[00:06:03.080 --> 00:06:08.260]   the Samaritans, and that's part of the reason why there was such animosity between them.
[00:06:08.260 --> 00:06:11.020]   And so after a while, they got tired and they quit.
[00:06:11.020 --> 00:06:16.340]   And so as a result, Haggai is sent to prophesy against the nation of Israel, basically saying
[00:06:16.340 --> 00:06:17.760]   that your work is not done.
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.540]   You've forgotten about the temple, which is the very reason why I sent you.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:31.940]   And so the passage in Haggai, okay, let me wait until it comes up.
[00:06:31.940 --> 00:06:33.940]   Wow.
[00:06:33.940 --> 00:06:44.420]   Oh, wow, that was what, 15 seconds?
[00:06:44.420 --> 00:06:46.500]   All right.
[00:06:46.500 --> 00:06:51.040]   I'm just going to read this passage to you because it's kind of consistent or reminiscent
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:52.660]   of the text that we're looking at.
[00:06:52.660 --> 00:06:56.700]   Haggai 1, 7-11, God speaks through Haggai to the nation of Israel.
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:59.580]   "Thus says the Lord of hosts, 'Consider your ways.
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:03.820]   Go up to the hills and bring wood and build a house that I may take pleasure in it and
[00:07:03.820 --> 00:07:05.300]   that I may be glorified,' says the Lord.
[00:07:05.300 --> 00:07:08.840]   'You looked for much and behold, it came to little.
[00:07:08.840 --> 00:07:10.860]   When you brought it home, I blew it away.'
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:12.140]   Why declares the Lord of hosts?
[00:07:12.140 --> 00:07:15.060]   Because of my house that lies in ruins.
[00:07:15.060 --> 00:07:19.700]   While each of you busies himself with his own house, therefore the heavens above have
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:24.540]   withheld the dew and the earth has withheld its produce.
[00:07:24.540 --> 00:07:29.300]   And I have called for a drought on the land and the hills and on the grain, the new wine,
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:35.140]   the oil on which the ground brings forth on man and beast and on all their labor.'"
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:39.380]   So basically God says to the nation of Israel, the reason why you're frustrated in your commerce
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:45.340]   and in your homes is because you haven't completed the task that you were sent to do, which is
[00:07:45.340 --> 00:07:46.640]   to build a temple.
[00:07:46.640 --> 00:07:53.420]   We don't know exactly what the work was in Sardis that Jesus is referring to where their
[00:07:53.420 --> 00:07:56.240]   work is being is incomplete.
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:08:00.760]   But all we know is whatever it was that God sent them to do, they forgot about it.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:07.180]   Maybe they started enjoying church and they just started going through the motions and
[00:08:07.180 --> 00:08:10.640]   taking care of their children and maybe they weren't evangelizing.
[00:08:10.640 --> 00:08:13.080]   It doesn't specify what the problem is.
[00:08:13.080 --> 00:08:18.240]   But because of their incomplete work, even though they may at one point may have been
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:23.560]   alive, he said in God's eyes now they are dead.
[00:08:23.560 --> 00:08:27.540]   So the call to this church is to repent.
[00:08:27.540 --> 00:08:31.820]   And this is the same exhortation that he gives to all the churches that he has an issue with.
[00:08:31.820 --> 00:08:33.840]   He doesn't say do this and do this.
[00:08:33.840 --> 00:08:39.620]   He says first and foremost, whenever God has something against, the first thing that needs
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.260]   to be rectified is repentance.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.380]   And repentance basically means is owning up to that sin.
[00:08:45.380 --> 00:08:50.620]   If we don't recognize our own sin, our repentance would be disingenuous.
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:55.700]   So the first thing he calls us to and he points out what the sin is and then he calls to repentance
[00:08:55.700 --> 00:08:57.360]   as he does to all of them.
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:03.500]   And more specifically, he calls them to wake up from their indifference.
[00:09:03.500 --> 00:09:08.540]   Whatever it takes to strengthen what they do not have before it dies.
[00:09:08.540 --> 00:09:12.700]   There are certain things that they have that hasn't died yet, but it's in danger of dying
[00:09:12.700 --> 00:09:17.780]   if they don't pay attention to it right away.
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:21.300]   So like the church of Ephesus, they are to remember.
[00:09:21.300 --> 00:09:25.580]   And so remember he says the same thing to the church of Ephesus.
[00:09:25.580 --> 00:09:27.520]   They lost their first love.
[00:09:27.520 --> 00:09:29.640]   And what are they to do?
[00:09:29.640 --> 00:09:34.140]   Not to innovate, to find new things or new ways to do something.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:35.820]   He says no, to remember.
[00:09:35.820 --> 00:09:41.520]   The reason why you've fallen away and why you have abandoned your first love and why
[00:09:41.520 --> 00:09:48.600]   you have a reputation of being alive but you're actually dead is because you're forgotten.
[00:09:48.600 --> 00:09:50.820]   You've forgotten who saved you.
[00:09:50.820 --> 00:09:53.940]   You've forgotten what God saved you from.
[00:09:53.940 --> 00:10:00.740]   Or maybe you didn't forget, but it no longer has an impact on you.
[00:10:00.740 --> 00:10:04.780]   The fact that Christ saved you from your sins, it's old news.
[00:10:04.780 --> 00:10:07.060]   It's not new news.
[00:10:07.060 --> 00:10:09.020]   You've kind of moved on from that.
[00:10:09.020 --> 00:10:10.980]   It's kind of like the honeymoon was over.
[00:10:10.980 --> 00:10:12.980]   Now you're just going through the grind.
[00:10:12.980 --> 00:10:16.680]   And so the remedy that Jesus gives to this church, which consisted with all the other
[00:10:16.680 --> 00:10:22.820]   churches is to repent, to wake up from where you are, recognize the situation that you're
[00:10:22.820 --> 00:10:23.820]   in.
[00:10:23.820 --> 00:10:25.900]   And again, he's not talking about idolatry.
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:28.220]   He's not talking about sexual immorality.
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.880]   He says your work is not complete.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:32.620]   You just kind of drifted out.
[00:10:32.620 --> 00:10:40.180]   You're not completing the task that God called you to do and to remember and to obey.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.420]   And he says the present condition is because they become dull in remembering what they
[00:10:44.420 --> 00:10:48.540]   have in Christ.
[00:10:48.540 --> 00:10:52.480]   They've forgotten who God is in their life.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:11:01.840]   And as a result, the consequence, if they don't repent, that he will come, he will come
[00:11:01.840 --> 00:11:05.140]   to them like a thief in the night.
[00:11:05.140 --> 00:11:07.460]   Let me stop here for a second.
[00:11:07.460 --> 00:11:11.620]   And I'm going to revisit this later.
[00:11:11.620 --> 00:11:15.900]   Who does he say that Jesus' second coming is going to be like a thief?
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:23.500]   Do you remember where he says that before?
[00:11:23.500 --> 00:11:29.940]   Are Christians going to receive Jesus' second coming like a thief?
[00:11:29.940 --> 00:11:32.800]   He says exactly the opposite, right?
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:37.380]   That you ought to stay sober and awake so that when he comes, he will not be like the
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.660]   thief, that you ought to watch and be careful so he would not overtake you like the world.
[00:11:42.660 --> 00:11:47.660]   But here it says, if you don't wake up and repent and you continue in your state, he
[00:11:47.660 --> 00:11:51.800]   said when he comes, it's not going to be this, wow, Jesus is coming.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:54.800]   It's not going to be a welcome sight.
[00:11:54.800 --> 00:12:02.160]   And so the idea, the imagery of thief coming in, thief is coming in unexpectedly to do
[00:12:02.160 --> 00:12:04.000]   damage, right?
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.200]   So the idea of Jesus' second coming is for judgment.
[00:12:08.200 --> 00:12:11.960]   So again, and I want you to think about that for a second because he's writing this to
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:14.000]   the church.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:18.680]   He's writing to the church and yet he says, if you do not wake up, you don't repent and
[00:12:18.680 --> 00:12:23.740]   you're not restored where you ought to be, his second coming, he's going to come with
[00:12:23.740 --> 00:12:25.840]   judgment, right?
[00:12:25.840 --> 00:12:32.400]   And I want you to think about that for a second because there's this tension in every one
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:37.560]   of these letters where God brings judgment, where his judgment sounds like a judgment
[00:12:37.560 --> 00:12:40.360]   against non-Christians, okay?
[00:12:40.360 --> 00:12:42.160]   And I'm going to revisit that.
[00:12:42.160 --> 00:12:44.920]   And I don't want you to just dismiss it and say, well, he's going to come like a thief,
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:48.280]   but you know, we're Christians, so we're no longer under judgment of God.
[00:12:48.280 --> 00:12:55.980]   So therefore, even if we don't wake up, even if they don't repent, since we really believe,
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:12:57.300]   he really won't overtake us.
[00:12:57.300 --> 00:13:02.500]   So he must be talking about some other people, not talking about us, right?
[00:13:02.500 --> 00:13:07.300]   But I want you to read that, read this text carefully to see if he's, if he is talking,
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:09.240]   he is talking to the church.
[00:13:09.240 --> 00:13:15.860]   So how do we reconcile this, a warning given to the church to wake up and repent, to restore
[00:13:15.860 --> 00:13:22.220]   the first love, to repent, right?
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:27.160]   But again, I'm going to come and revisit this, but I want you to understand the tension that's
[00:13:27.160 --> 00:13:31.480]   not just here, but in other passages as well, right?
[00:13:31.480 --> 00:13:35.820]   But for those who are faithful and the ones who repent and conquer, Christ promises three
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.340]   things, right?
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:42.780]   They will be dressed in white, right?
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:49.140]   Their names will not be blotted out in the book of life, and Christ will acknowledge
[00:13:49.140 --> 00:13:50.460]   them before God and his angels.
[00:13:50.460 --> 00:13:52.820]   So I want you to think about this too, right?
[00:13:52.820 --> 00:13:58.900]   He's talking to the church, and he says if you don't repent, he's going to come just
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.340]   like he's coming to the rest of the world to bring judgment upon them.
[00:14:03.340 --> 00:14:11.020]   But if you do repent and you continue, right, and you are restored, he says you will be
[00:14:11.020 --> 00:14:12.020]   dressed in white.
[00:14:12.020 --> 00:14:13.100]   What does dressed in white mean?
[00:14:13.100 --> 00:14:15.420]   Your sins are forgiven, right?
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:17.420]   Your sins will be justified.
[00:14:17.420 --> 00:14:19.380]   Their names will not be blotted out in the book of life.
[00:14:19.380 --> 00:14:21.060]   Whose name is blotted out in the book of life?
[00:14:21.060 --> 00:14:22.060]   Non-Christians.
[00:14:22.060 --> 00:14:27.400]   Do you understand what I'm asking?
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:29.000]   He's talking to the church.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:35.140]   He says if you do not repent, right, only those who repent and are restored, their books
[00:14:35.140 --> 00:14:37.080]   will not be blotted out in the book of life.
[00:14:37.080 --> 00:14:41.900]   And then thirdly, he says Christ will acknowledge them before God and his angels, right?
[00:14:41.900 --> 00:14:47.260]   Remember Matthew 10, 32, "He who denies me before men, I will deny him before my Father.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.220]   He who acknowledges me before men, I will acknowledge him before my Father."
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:51.220]   Who is he talking to?
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.180]   Non-Christians, right?
[00:14:53.180 --> 00:14:57.420]   He's distinguishing between Christian and non-Christian, yet he's talking to the church
[00:14:57.420 --> 00:15:03.460]   who have a reputation of being alive, and if they don't repent, then restored.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:06.340]   All of these judgments are things that he has said to non-Christians.
[00:15:06.340 --> 00:15:08.540]   So how do we reconcile this, right?
[00:15:08.540 --> 00:15:12.700]   Well, I'm going to revisit this later on.
[00:15:12.700 --> 00:15:18.860]   Because, well, I'll revisit this later.
[00:15:18.860 --> 00:15:21.180]   The Church of Philadelphia.
[00:15:21.180 --> 00:15:28.620]   Jesus is described as the Holy One, the True One, who has the key of David, who opens and
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:31.540]   no one will shut, and who shuts and no one opens.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.540]   Now this is not described in chapter 1.
[00:15:33.540 --> 00:15:38.620]   There's a new description of Christ, but it's particularly related to this church.
[00:15:38.620 --> 00:15:44.500]   The term "Holy One" is a common term used in the Old Testament to refer to God the Father,
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:45.500]   right?
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:48.500]   And clearly here, it is saying that Jesus Christ is God.
[00:15:48.500 --> 00:15:53.340]   So if anybody says Jesus is Son of God, Son of Man, but not God himself, this is one of
[00:15:53.340 --> 00:15:54.820]   the texts that you can come to.
[00:15:54.820 --> 00:15:56.940]   He's called the Holy One, right?
[00:15:56.940 --> 00:16:00.100]   This title only belongs to God, God the Father.
[00:16:00.100 --> 00:16:05.060]   And so he's called the Holy One, and he's also called the True One, right?
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:11.180]   It's added to refer to Christ as a true Messiah who has the key of David.
[00:16:11.180 --> 00:16:16.580]   And the key term, "key of David" is referenced to the Messianic complete reign.
[00:16:16.580 --> 00:16:22.420]   In other words, the key of David meaning that the prophecy was that the King of Israel,
[00:16:22.420 --> 00:16:25.160]   Messiah, was going to be a descendant of David.
[00:16:25.160 --> 00:16:29.740]   So to have the key of David means that Jesus is the fulfillment of that, right?
[00:16:29.740 --> 00:16:33.860]   So he's the true Messiah who is the Holy One.
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:37.700]   So he's not only Christ, he's God himself.
[00:16:37.700 --> 00:16:39.820]   And that's the identity.
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:43.100]   And this is a clear fulfillment of prophecy.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:45.100]   All right.
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:52.800]   You're going to have to give me a second.
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:55.740]   Which is mentioned in Isaiah 22, 22.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:16:59.020]   There you go.
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:04.820]   This is a Messianic prophecy about when Christ comes that this is going to be fulfilled.
[00:17:04.820 --> 00:17:08.460]   And it says, "I will place on his shoulder the key of the house of David.
[00:17:08.460 --> 00:17:13.060]   He shall open and none shall shut, and he shall shut and none shall open."
[00:17:13.060 --> 00:17:16.140]   So clearly this is in reference to Christ and his fulfillment.
[00:17:16.140 --> 00:17:22.060]   So not only is he the fulfillment of the prophecy of the descendant of David, but he's the Holy
[00:17:22.060 --> 00:17:26.340]   One, the True One.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.580]   Now why is this title important to them?
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.940]   This church and Smyrna are the only two churches that have no negative remarks on the church.
[00:17:35.940 --> 00:17:40.140]   And so if you notice that both churches were heavily persecuted.
[00:17:40.140 --> 00:17:44.080]   They were enduring an intense amount of suffering.
[00:17:44.080 --> 00:17:51.640]   And both churches are only given commendations.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:56.180]   The reference again of the synagogue of Satan is to highlight the persecution primarily
[00:17:56.180 --> 00:17:57.980]   coming from the Jews.
[00:17:57.980 --> 00:18:03.620]   So this was an area where the Jewish community was sizable.
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:10.100]   And the synagogue of Satan basically is reference that if you didn't cooperate.
[00:18:10.100 --> 00:18:14.900]   So if you came around and you started proclaiming the gospel and you started saying Jesus Christ
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:19.220]   was resurrected from the dead, what happened to you as a Jew?
[00:18:19.220 --> 00:18:21.800]   You get kicked out of the synagogue, right?
[00:18:21.800 --> 00:18:26.760]   If you get kicked out of the synagogue, what would your life look like?
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:30.020]   I try to think about what that would be familiar, like similar to today.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:32.520]   Maybe get kicked out of Facebook.
[00:18:32.520 --> 00:18:33.900]   I don't know.
[00:18:33.900 --> 00:18:38.160]   You know, what's a community that we belong to that if you don't, if you're not part of,
[00:18:38.160 --> 00:18:41.600]   you'll be maybe being kicked out of the church could be, right?
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:45.140]   But you have to understand that if you were a Jew at that time, the synagogue was where
[00:18:45.140 --> 00:18:47.920]   your children went to get education.
[00:18:47.920 --> 00:18:49.580]   That was your school.
[00:18:49.580 --> 00:18:52.320]   That was where men got together to fellowship.
[00:18:52.320 --> 00:18:56.400]   That's where women got together and they lived, they shared things together.
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:03.160]   So a Jewish community typically was not integrated into the Gentile world, right?
[00:19:03.160 --> 00:19:07.240]   So everything that you know about what it was like, the Jews would not even sit and
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:08.240]   eat with the Gentiles.
[00:19:08.240 --> 00:19:12.760]   So if you were rejected by the synagogue, basically you were shunned.
[00:19:12.760 --> 00:19:20.560]   You might as well just pack up and live outside the city because everything that you needed
[00:19:20.560 --> 00:19:25.500]   to survive, it was centered around the synagogue, right?
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:32.040]   So if that's what he says is synagogue of Satan and they kick you out, pretty much your
[00:19:32.040 --> 00:19:33.040]   life is done.
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.160]   Not only your life, but your family, whatever business that you were running, education.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:43.800]   I mean, you were basically shunned from everything, Facebook, Instagram, Costco, church, everything,
[00:19:43.800 --> 00:19:44.800]   right?
[00:19:44.800 --> 00:19:47.700]   You just could not, you wouldn't be able to function.
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:53.640]   So when Jesus says, "I am the one who opens and shuts," right?
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:57.720]   It's very much related to what was going on in this particular city because they're being
[00:19:57.720 --> 00:20:00.240]   kicked out of the door of the synagogue.
[00:20:00.240 --> 00:20:05.360]   And we see the same thing here where, I think I have another passage.
[00:20:05.360 --> 00:20:12.760]   John chapter 10 verse 9, where Jesus says, "I am the door," right?
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:15.840]   And it sounds a lot like how he described himself here.
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.560]   And the reason why he says that, "I am the door.
[00:20:18.560 --> 00:20:23.960]   If anyone enters by me, he will be saved and will go in and out and find pasture."
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.640]   And the very next "I am" statement in John chapter 10 is, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:34.280]   Does anybody know what happens in John chapter 9?
[00:20:34.280 --> 00:20:42.720]   I know you guys are all thinking it, but for the sake of time, John chapter 9 is where
[00:20:42.720 --> 00:20:47.100]   the blind man gains his sight, right?
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:51.540]   And as a result of that, he has this encounter with the Jewish leaders and then he gets,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:52.540]   what happens to him?
[00:20:52.540 --> 00:20:55.500]   He gets bold, he's like, "Do you want to be a disciple too?"
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:21:00.000]   And then they get angry, he said, "He gets kicked out of the synagogue," right?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:01.960]   So he gets kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:06.920]   Remember, even his parents were afraid to confront the Jewish leaders because they knew
[00:21:06.920 --> 00:21:10.120]   if they didn't cooperate with the Jewish leaders that they would get kicked out.
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.560]   So they kind of took the fifth, right?
[00:21:13.560 --> 00:21:14.560]   We don't know.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.040]   I mean, clearly he's our son and he was blind, but now he sees.
[00:21:17.040 --> 00:21:18.800]   But as far as who did it, I don't know.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:20.080]   You better just go ask him.
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:24.520]   So they basically take the fifth, but the guy who has his eyes open, he's bold.
[00:21:24.520 --> 00:21:27.660]   He's, you know, he's like, "Do you want to be his disciple too?"
[00:21:27.660 --> 00:21:29.920]   So he gets kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:21:29.920 --> 00:21:32.560]   So that, for a Jew, that would have been the greatest fear.
[00:21:32.560 --> 00:21:39.480]   So imagine if you were a blind man, you know, that you couldn't be a part of society.
[00:21:39.480 --> 00:21:44.120]   So you were already outside of the synagogue, right?
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:46.120]   You were already outside.
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:49.760]   So all of a sudden he gets healed and now he can have a normal life.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:54.080]   And then the Jews are saying that if you don't deny Christ and say he didn't do it, we're
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.000]   going to kick you out.
[00:21:56.000 --> 00:22:00.320]   So can you imagine the temptation that he might have been in because gaining his sight
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.640]   meant everything for him.
[00:22:01.640 --> 00:22:04.880]   Everything in his life would have been restored, but he stands up to them and says he gets
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:05.880]   kicked out.
[00:22:05.880 --> 00:22:11.280]   So it is the very next section where Jesus says, "I am the door."
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:12.280]   Right?
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:13.720]   I am the good shepherd.
[00:22:13.720 --> 00:22:15.840]   It's not the synagogue.
[00:22:15.840 --> 00:22:20.640]   All the Jews are trying so hard to appease the synagogue leaders because they think that
[00:22:20.640 --> 00:22:22.000]   that's where they're going to find life.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:24.480]   And Jesus is telling them, "I am the door."
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.840]   And the very next "I am" statement is, "I am the good shepherd."
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.080]   So even if they kick you out, right, I will open and no one will shut.
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:33.960]   And I will shut, no one will open.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:40.080]   And that's basically what's happening also in this church in Philadelphia.
[00:22:40.080 --> 00:22:51.360]   So the door that Jesus is referring to, obviously, is the kingdom, the kingdom of God.
[00:22:51.360 --> 00:22:57.160]   That though they may be shut out of the earthly doors of the synagogue, the true house of
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:06.480]   God, only Jesus has power to open and shut.
[00:23:06.480 --> 00:23:10.640]   And as a result of their perseverance and not compromising, they will be rewarded for
[00:23:10.640 --> 00:23:12.840]   not denying him.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:15.280]   And they will be kept from the hour of trial.
[00:23:15.280 --> 00:23:21.880]   Now, we could spend a lot of time here talking about what this means because some will interpret
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.400]   this as pre-trib.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:30.520]   Doesn't this say that the church is going to be preserved from the tribulation?
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:34.760]   So this is one of the verses, it's not the only verse, it's one of the verses that is
[00:23:34.760 --> 00:23:38.880]   used to describe pre-trib rapture.
[00:23:38.880 --> 00:23:42.120]   He's going to come and deliver the church and clearly he says he's going to save us
[00:23:42.120 --> 00:23:44.800]   from the time of trial.
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:49.960]   But some interpret this as a rapture to save them from the tribulation.
[00:23:49.960 --> 00:23:57.160]   Some, me included, believe that this means that Jesus will give them strength to persevere
[00:23:57.160 --> 00:23:58.160]   through these trials.
[00:23:58.160 --> 00:24:02.520]   Not he's going to save them so that they don't experience these trials, but through these
[00:24:02.520 --> 00:24:05.960]   trials that he's going to strengthen them so that he may persevere.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:10.900]   And the reason why I believe that, and again, we can spend a lot of time talking about this,
[00:24:10.900 --> 00:24:15.280]   but part of the reason, and I'm going to make my case here, at least three points, Jesus'
[00:24:15.280 --> 00:24:20.760]   high priestly prayer in John 17, 15, where he says, "My prayer is not that you take them
[00:24:20.760 --> 00:24:23.720]   out of the world, but that you protect them from the evil one."
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:33.040]   Secondly, Jesus repeatedly exhorted and promised that those who conquer or abuse, that says
[00:24:33.040 --> 00:24:36.140]   this exact same thing in different ways.
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:40.540]   He doesn't say those he snatches away that doesn't experience the suffering, but he says
[00:24:40.540 --> 00:24:46.480]   those who, in the context of severe suffering and persecution, who do not deny Christ and
[00:24:46.480 --> 00:24:49.720]   perseveres to the end, he says those will be saved.
[00:24:49.720 --> 00:24:51.560]   So he will allow the church to be tested.
[00:24:51.560 --> 00:24:57.160]   And then finally, thirdly, the post-tribulation view seems to fit better with other parts
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:01.560]   of scripture where we are commended for suffering for Christ.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:08.080]   So where Paul considers it an honor, right, that he was chosen to suffer for the name
[00:25:08.080 --> 00:25:09.740]   of Christ.
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.520]   So suffering, at least in the way that we see it in the New Testament, is given to a
[00:25:14.520 --> 00:25:16.880]   special selection of people.
[00:25:16.880 --> 00:25:20.480]   So it's not that because he loves us, he's going to preserve us from the suffering, but
[00:25:20.480 --> 00:25:25.080]   because he loves us, he's going to preserve us through the suffering.
[00:25:25.080 --> 00:25:31.960]   Now again, I can spend a lot of time here, but I think this is more, again, my view is
[00:25:31.960 --> 00:25:37.520]   that we are going to go through an intense period of tribulation, and he's going to test
[00:25:37.520 --> 00:25:42.160]   the church, and those who have the reputation of being alive but really dead are going to
[00:25:42.160 --> 00:25:46.000]   be tested and found that they were never really alive.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.120]   And then there's people who lost their first love, and they don't repent, right?
[00:25:51.120 --> 00:25:55.440]   And so all of these churches that do not repent, that do not conquer, that they're going to
[00:25:55.440 --> 00:26:00.160]   go through these tribulations, and they're going to be found that they were, again, that
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.360]   in the end that they were not alive.
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:11.120]   And obviously it might bring us more peace to think that before the real stuff comes,
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:12.800]   that we're not going to be here.
[00:26:12.800 --> 00:26:18.240]   But I don't see that as consistent with everything else that I've seen in Scripture, nor in church
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:19.240]   history, right?
[00:26:19.240 --> 00:26:22.120]   Nor do I see that, what's going on.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:26.400]   So because you and I live in a comfortable society where we don't understand persecution,
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:30.320]   and we say, "Oh, he's going to preserve us from that," there's a whole world of people
[00:26:30.320 --> 00:26:34.080]   who are going through intense suffering today.
[00:26:34.080 --> 00:26:37.880]   They're not being preserved in the sense that they're not being rescued from that.
[00:26:37.880 --> 00:26:39.920]   They're going through it, right?
[00:26:39.920 --> 00:26:44.840]   The only reason why it's difficult for us to have it in our world is because we don't
[00:26:44.840 --> 00:26:47.200]   experience this suffering.
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:51.520]   And so we think preservation means that he's going to keep it this way, and that we're
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:55.640]   going to have a nice and comfortable life, you know, and this is such a blessing, so
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:58.600]   we're going to be here, and the next thing we know, we're going to be up in heaven.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:02.000]   I don't see that as consistent with what I see in Scripture.
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:07.160]   I believe that that persecution we see in the Middle East and in India, and that's
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:12.360]   spreading all over, is going to eventually come here, right?
[00:27:12.360 --> 00:27:17.080]   And those of you who've been around long enough, can you imagine the kind of prejudice
[00:27:17.080 --> 00:27:18.640]   that the Christians are experiencing today?
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:24.760]   I mean, it's still minimal compared to what's going on in the rest of the world, but if
[00:27:24.760 --> 00:27:29.560]   you told me 30 years ago the type of things that would cause you to get fired at your
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:37.920]   job or a radio announcer or an athlete says something about his faith and will get him
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:44.560]   banned and business shut down, rocks thrown at, 30 years ago, it would have been ridiculous.
[00:27:44.560 --> 00:27:47.240]   So 30 years from now, where will we be?
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.160]   30 years from now, where will we be?
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:51.040]   Who knows, right?
[00:27:51.040 --> 00:27:58.160]   And I think that the Scripture prepares us, right?
[00:27:58.160 --> 00:28:02.600]   Everything that I see in Scripture is a warning and encouragement to prepare us, because there's
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:06.880]   going to come a time where it's not always going to be this easy, right?
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:15.040]   Where we are going to be tested.
[00:28:15.040 --> 00:28:20.440]   For those who persevere, it says, they will be given a big crown, and the coming of Christ,
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.280]   though it is a threat to some churches, but it says to them, it's going to be a welcome
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:30.680]   promise where they will receive a crown.
[00:28:30.680 --> 00:28:34.680]   They will be made pillars of the temple of God, and they will never be sent out of it,
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:35.680]   right?
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.200]   Instead of these Jews, the synagogue of Satan that's casting them out and making their life
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:45.120]   difficult, and he said, no, you are the pillar, they are not.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:50.840]   So Jesus will write on them three things, the name of God, right?
[00:28:50.840 --> 00:28:54.760]   Which means that they belong to God.
[00:28:54.760 --> 00:29:00.740]   The name of God's city, indicating that their citizenship is in God's kingdom.
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:06.560]   And it says his own new name, that he will become completely new creation directly united
[00:29:06.560 --> 00:29:09.120]   with Christ.
[00:29:09.120 --> 00:29:12.960]   So that's the reward for this church for their suffering.
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:16.840]   In other words, salvation.
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:21.240]   Everything that he describes here is what every single genuine born again Christian
[00:29:21.240 --> 00:29:24.480]   is going to have, right?
[00:29:24.480 --> 00:29:27.480]   Is there any Christian that doesn't have the name of God, who doesn't have a citizenship
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:29.240]   in the kingdom?
[00:29:29.240 --> 00:29:32.800]   So the distinction he's making is between a Christian and a non-Christian, those who
[00:29:32.800 --> 00:29:37.240]   repent and those who do not repent, right?
[00:29:37.240 --> 00:29:42.940]   He's not describing a different level of Christians are going to have the name of God, and different
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:47.760]   level of Christians who persevere are going to have the citizenship in heaven.
[00:29:47.760 --> 00:29:51.360]   This is what he says about all Christians, right?
[00:29:51.360 --> 00:29:58.440]   But all Christians who persevere in the context of suffering, who doesn't deny Christ.
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:03.660]   And then obviously, I think you know, we all know much about this Laodicea because so much,
[00:30:03.660 --> 00:30:04.800]   so many sermons are given on that.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:11.400]   Jesus is referred to as the Amen, the faithful and true witness, the beginning of God's creation.
[00:30:11.400 --> 00:30:21.080]   So the Amen is mainly an acknowledgement of whatever is true and binding.
[00:30:21.080 --> 00:30:31.360]   Here the Amen may be a connection to the conclusion of the seven letters.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:36.520]   So some commentators believe that the reason why he's addressed as Amen is because he's
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:39.160]   concluding the seven letters.
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:42.520]   In either case, it's relevant to this particular church.
[00:30:42.520 --> 00:30:50.720]   Christ faithful and true witness is in contrast the unfaithful witness of the Laodiceans.
[00:30:50.720 --> 00:30:54.600]   And then Laodiceans became rich because of natural resources, and we're going to get
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:31:00.480]   into that in a minute, but Jesus is reminding them that he is the beginning of God's creation.
[00:31:00.480 --> 00:31:04.640]   So every single one of these titles to these churches have something directly related to
[00:31:04.640 --> 00:31:17.600]   what he has to say to these churches.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:26.440]   The Laodicean church was rebuked for their arrogance, and that's what led them to lukewarmness.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:34.060]   It says that they didn't see, because of their wealth, they didn't feel a need for anything.
[00:31:34.060 --> 00:31:38.040]   And that's where, at least here, I don't think that's the only thing that leads to lukewarmness,
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:41.360]   but at least in this particular church, it was their wealth.
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:47.360]   It was their self-sufficiency, that they weren't like the other who are poor, who are needy.
[00:31:47.360 --> 00:31:51.280]   Because they had money, they couldn't get whatever they needed.
[00:31:51.280 --> 00:31:57.600]   The Laodicea was a very wealthy area, and they were known for three particular things.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:02.780]   They were known for their banking, their garment industry, and their medical school.
[00:32:02.780 --> 00:32:09.320]   And all of that is reflected in the rebuke of this church.
[00:32:09.320 --> 00:32:13.200]   The city was a very important trade route, which naturally brought the banking industry.
[00:32:13.200 --> 00:32:19.880]   So remember, if you looked at the seven churches, you know how it kind of went in a circle like
[00:32:19.880 --> 00:32:20.880]   that?
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:25.720]   So Laodicea is in the bottom of that, and so it was an important trade route.
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:30.680]   So if you wanted to trade toward the east, you had to go through this particular city.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:36.320]   And it just happened that they had a lot of natural resources, so they were able to make
[00:32:36.320 --> 00:32:37.760]   a lot of money.
[00:32:37.760 --> 00:32:42.120]   So because a lot of money was being traded back and forth in this particular city, the
[00:32:42.120 --> 00:32:45.840]   banking industry was very strong in this city.
[00:32:45.840 --> 00:32:51.920]   And because of their natural resources, they had particular natural ailments.
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:55.520]   So the salve that he's talking about is a particular medicine that you can only find
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:32:56.980]   in this city.
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:33:01.680]   And then the garment that he talks about to wear white, again, is in contrast to the garment
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:02.680]   that they were selling there.
[00:33:02.680 --> 00:33:08.840]   So all of this has direct relevance to the wealth, the cause of wealth in this particular
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.360]   city.
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:16.240]   The natural resources led to medical fines and specific garments that could only be produced
[00:33:16.240 --> 00:33:17.240]   here.
[00:33:17.240 --> 00:33:22.320]   And he says their problem was they were neither hot nor cold.
[00:33:22.320 --> 00:33:28.240]   Now this doesn't mean that Jesus is saying that I'd rather you be completely worldly
[00:33:28.240 --> 00:33:29.600]   or on fire for God.
[00:33:29.600 --> 00:33:32.080]   That's not what hot and cold means.
[00:33:32.080 --> 00:33:38.040]   God is not saying to the church, "I'd rather have you living in debauchery, like all out,
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.480]   getting arrested, or on fire for God.
[00:33:40.480 --> 00:33:43.040]   Since you're neither, I'm going to spit you out of my mouth."
[00:33:43.040 --> 00:33:47.600]   He's referring to something very specific in this city.
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:52.800]   This city was known to have a hot spring that ran through.
[00:33:52.800 --> 00:33:57.260]   And by the time it went through, obviously at the end of it, it would become lukewarm.
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:01.700]   But obviously if you have a hot spring in the city, it would often be a place where
[00:34:01.700 --> 00:34:06.400]   people would go in, take baths for mineral and for health reasons.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:12.860]   It also had a cold water spring that didn't go through the city, but they had enough money
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.320]   to make an aqueduct that would bring them into the city.
[00:34:16.320 --> 00:34:19.620]   So if you had hot water, it would be used for medicinal purposes.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:23.680]   If you had cold water, it would be used for refreshing, for drinking.
[00:34:23.680 --> 00:34:29.040]   And he says, "Either one would be useful, but because you're neither," he says, "I'll
[00:34:29.040 --> 00:34:31.240]   spit you out."
[00:34:31.240 --> 00:34:34.120]   So think about that imagery.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.840]   He doesn't just say, "I have this against you."
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:38.960]   No, all the other churches where he says, "Yet I have this against you."
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:42.680]   You have all these things, but yet I have this against you because you tolerate the
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:45.880]   Nicolaitans, you tolerate Jezebel.
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:51.160]   He says to this whole church, "I can't stand you."
[00:34:51.160 --> 00:34:52.160]   Isn't that basically what he's saying?
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:56.600]   When he says, "Spit you out," like what would you spit out?
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:35:00.720]   He's something you put into your mouth that you just can't stand for even a second.
[00:35:00.720 --> 00:35:03.520]   He's not just taking it out, he's spitting it out.
[00:35:03.520 --> 00:35:10.560]   So that's why I think the harshest judgment, criticism, and rebuke is to this lukewarm
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:11.560]   church.
[00:35:11.560 --> 00:35:19.840]   What was at the core of this problem?
[00:35:19.840 --> 00:35:25.040]   Their wealth blinded them to think that they were well off, but Jesus warns them that they
[00:35:25.040 --> 00:35:33.000]   are really wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, and naked.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:41.440]   What caused them to be, forgot to use these extreme descriptions of this church, wretched.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:47.200]   Francis Chan believes that these are descriptions of non-Christians.
[00:35:47.200 --> 00:35:52.040]   I don't know if you've ever heard him preach on this, but he basically says a lukewarm
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:56.520]   Christian isn't a Christian.
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:01.720]   But I want you to understand the tension where he may be getting that.
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:09.600]   Wretched, pitiable, poor, blind, naked.
[00:36:09.600 --> 00:36:15.880]   If you think that's a Christian, that would cause a lot of problems.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:21.480]   If you think it's a non-Christian, it would also cause a lot of problems.
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:24.320]   But that's how Jesus describes them.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:26.740]   He can't stand them.
[00:36:26.740 --> 00:36:31.160]   The only way to truly become rich, he says, is to seek Christ.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:36.080]   Buy gold refined by fire from him instead of going after the wealth of the world.
[00:36:36.080 --> 00:36:40.920]   Buy white garments rather than the black garments that Laodicea was known for to clothe their
[00:36:40.920 --> 00:36:41.920]   nakedness.
[00:36:41.920 --> 00:36:44.880]   Nakedness obviously is a reference to their shame.
[00:36:44.880 --> 00:36:51.040]   Instead of flaunting their wealth and wearing these elaborate garments to show off, he says,
[00:36:51.040 --> 00:36:57.880]   you're actually naked and in shame to come to Christ and to wear the white that he gives.
[00:36:57.880 --> 00:37:03.600]   Buy salves from him and not to put their confidence simply on the medical salves that was found
[00:37:03.600 --> 00:37:09.600]   in the city to really see with spiritual eyes.
[00:37:09.600 --> 00:37:14.120]   And then that passage, I think the memory verse for this week.
[00:37:14.120 --> 00:37:18.840]   Oh, what is this?
[00:37:18.840 --> 00:37:22.840]   Okay, I went too fast.
[00:37:22.840 --> 00:37:25.080]   Oh, sorry.
[00:37:25.080 --> 00:37:26.080]   Yeah.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:32.640]   Jesus promises to restore intimate fellowship with the church if they repent.
[00:37:32.640 --> 00:37:38.920]   Behold, I stand at the door and knock.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:43.640]   If anyone hears my voice and opens the door, I will come into him and I will dine with
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:45.480]   him and he with me.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:53.600]   And so that promises where Jesus, where is Jesus in this church?
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:57.080]   In every church he says he's in the midst, but here he's, where is he?
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:37:58.840]   He's standing outside.
[00:37:58.840 --> 00:38:03.160]   He's standing outside the church knocking to be in their midst, to get in.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:06.800]   And he says, I will fellowship with you if you open the door.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:09.120]   Obviously that's a call to repentance.
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:13.280]   If you recognize your lukewarmness and you repent and you open the door, then I will
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:14.880]   come and commune with you.
[00:38:14.880 --> 00:38:19.160]   In other words, there's no communion now.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:25.480]   Repentance must take place.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:31.000]   And again, I want to talk about what I originally started with, this tension between justification
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.280]   and sanctification.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:38.400]   But before we even get to that, think about like every one of these letters, what he says,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:44.040]   in particular what he says to that church of Ephesus, the church of Sardis, and even
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:50.440]   to the other churches, that this was meant for us to read.
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:55.240]   This was not something that was written 2,000 years ago, oh, these churches had these problems.
[00:38:55.240 --> 00:38:58.440]   He's talking to the lukewarm church.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.600]   He's talking to a church that's doing everything that seems to be right, but they've abandoned
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:05.000]   their first love.
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:09.980]   He's talking to a church that has a reputation of being alive, but in actuality they're dead.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:13.420]   He's talking to a church that are doing some things great, but they're tolerating wickedness
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:17.100]   in the church, and they're just kind of sweeping sin underneath the rug, and they're not dealing
[00:39:17.100 --> 00:39:18.200]   with it.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.880]   So they're defiling the temple of God.
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:24.120]   There's certain parts of the church, they said, and every single one of them that he
[00:39:24.120 --> 00:39:29.200]   points out, he says, if you do not repent, there's serious consequences.
[00:39:29.200 --> 00:39:35.200]   And the consequences that he tells us is not just a slap on the hand.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:40.480]   In fact, they're so severe, it kind of, that this is what causes us to take a step back
[00:39:40.480 --> 00:39:44.600]   and say, are they Christians?
[00:39:44.600 --> 00:39:50.680]   I want to deal with that just a few minutes before I break you off into your small group.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:40:00.120]   That tension between the justification and sanctification, we can err on both sides.
[00:40:00.120 --> 00:40:02.880]   We can look at this and say, yeah, that's pretty serious.
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:09.320]   If you don't repent, he's on the outside, and he's going to come like a thief.
[00:40:09.320 --> 00:40:12.680]   And only those who conquer and repent, that he's going to put his name, or he's going
[00:40:12.680 --> 00:40:14.440]   to be the citizen.
[00:40:14.440 --> 00:40:18.080]   He's making a distinction between Christian and non-Christian.
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:24.040]   So we can just kind of err on this side and just dismiss this because one saved always
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:25.180]   saved.
[00:40:25.180 --> 00:40:26.180]   We can't lose ourselves.
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:32.580]   I mean, you're in a reformed Calvinistic church, so you know that one saved always saved.
[00:40:32.580 --> 00:40:35.160]   Salvation is not earned, so you already know all of that.
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.360]   So we can falsely feel security, just kind of gloss over, even if we are guilty of all
[00:40:41.360 --> 00:40:45.080]   of these things, we can just kind of gloss over all of these things and hold it on to
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:46.400]   a security.
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:53.320]   And yet, we see texts like this and warning like this, and we just, something in us just
[00:40:53.320 --> 00:40:58.000]   kind of, this is not applying to us, or it's not real.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:03.200]   Now the reason why I ask you to think about this is because this tension, anybody who
[00:41:03.200 --> 00:41:08.760]   studies the scripture carefully is going to come out with this tension.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:13.320]   We are told that we have absolute eternal security, we're saved by grace and not by
[00:41:13.320 --> 00:41:14.600]   works.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:21.360]   And yet, we see warning after warning after warning of lukewarmness, of being worldly,
[00:41:21.360 --> 00:41:26.560]   of tolerating sin, of having certain reputation but not being true.
[00:41:26.560 --> 00:41:29.200]   And the consequences are judgment.
[00:41:29.200 --> 00:41:32.280]   And yet the scripture says there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:35.720]   So what do we do with this tension?
[00:41:35.720 --> 00:41:40.040]   So if you're not paying attention to scripture, you can just live in licentiousness and say
[00:41:40.040 --> 00:41:43.720]   one saved, always saved, and then not live with this tension because you're not really
[00:41:43.720 --> 00:41:44.720]   reading the scripture.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:49.200]   Or you can live in this other end where you've heard that you have absolute security and
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.580]   you're not looking into scripture.
[00:41:51.580 --> 00:41:54.540]   So you can live with security, doing whatever you want.
[00:41:54.540 --> 00:41:57.600]   But if you're studying the scripture like we're studying it and going through verse
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:42:02.960]   by verse, you know that there's a tension here.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.120]   Though we're saved by grace, there is consequence for living in sin.
[00:42:07.120 --> 00:42:09.720]   And it is not just a slap on the hand.
[00:42:09.720 --> 00:42:14.080]   So I want you to look at some of these verses.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:19.880]   Revelation 2, 5 says, "If you don't repent, I will come to you and remove your lampstand
[00:42:19.880 --> 00:42:22.400]   from its place unless you repent."
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:30.000]   So what is a lampstand in the Church of Ephesus?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:31.640]   We are the light of the world, right?
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:36.080]   So it's kind of like if you're the salt of the world and if you lose its flavor, what
[00:42:36.080 --> 00:42:39.320]   good is it other than to be thrown and to be trampled?
[00:42:39.320 --> 00:42:41.480]   Does that sound like a Christian?
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:46.640]   He says if you don't renew your first love, he will remove his lampstand.
[00:42:46.640 --> 00:42:47.640]   So there's that tension.
[00:42:47.640 --> 00:42:48.640]   He's talking to Christians.
[00:42:48.880 --> 00:42:55.280]   And yet he says the consequence of unrepentance is removal of lampstand.
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.360]   Revelation 2, 16, "Therefore repent.
[00:42:57.360 --> 00:43:02.160]   If not, I will come to you soon and war against them with the sword of my mouth."
[00:43:02.160 --> 00:43:12.000]   Revelation 2, 22, "Behold, I will throw her onto a sickbed, and those who commit adultery
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:16.840]   with her I will throw into great tribulation unless they repent of her works, and I will
[00:43:16.840 --> 00:43:18.520]   strike her children dead."
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:24.680]   Talking about the sin of Jezebel and idolatry and those who follow along, right?
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.640]   So again, these are all warnings given to the church.
[00:43:27.640 --> 00:43:28.920]   He's not writing to pagans.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:32.960]   He's writing to the church, to the angel of the Church of Ephesus, to the angel of the
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:35.280]   church of Laodicea, right?
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:39.040]   Angel of the church of Sardis, right?
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.080]   He says, "If you will not wake up, I will come like a thief, and you will not know at
[00:43:43.080 --> 00:43:45.000]   what hour I will come against you."
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.120]   He's talking about the church, right?
[00:43:47.120 --> 00:43:54.920]   So there's this tension in the scripture of absolute security in Christ, and yet there's
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:44:01.800]   a strong call to repentance and live righteous holy lives, or there are serious consequences,
[00:44:01.800 --> 00:44:03.080]   right?
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:11.340]   So in order to deal with this tension, different groups have come up with different theology
[00:44:11.340 --> 00:44:14.120]   to try to answer this tension.
[00:44:14.120 --> 00:44:20.200]   So you have one group who teaches salvation by works, right?
[00:44:20.200 --> 00:44:22.880]   Because the scripture says you have to do this.
[00:44:22.880 --> 00:44:23.880]   You have to repent.
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:26.120]   You have to redo what you did at first.
[00:44:26.120 --> 00:44:31.040]   So call to repentance isn't just feel bad, right?
[00:44:31.040 --> 00:44:33.720]   Call to repentance is to redo what you did at first.
[00:44:33.720 --> 00:44:35.940]   So salvation, you have to work hard at it.
[00:44:35.940 --> 00:44:37.440]   So that's how they reconcile.
[00:44:37.440 --> 00:44:42.480]   And so obviously, you know, obviously that's a contradiction to justification by faith
[00:44:42.480 --> 00:44:44.520]   alone and not by works.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:46.580]   Clearly we've been going through that in the Book of Romans.
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:52.420]   But that's how one group have tried to embrace these passages or try to reconcile.
[00:44:52.420 --> 00:44:57.540]   Some have embraced Arminianism, which believes that salvation can be lost.
[00:44:57.540 --> 00:45:01.360]   You may look at these passages and these warnings that said, "We're writing to the church,
[00:45:01.360 --> 00:45:05.740]   but he says if they don't repent, he's going to come like a thief and bring judgment."
[00:45:05.740 --> 00:45:09.560]   And yet the scripture says there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus, so therefore
[00:45:09.560 --> 00:45:12.200]   they must have lost their salvation.
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.720]   So that's how that group has reconciled this.
[00:45:15.720 --> 00:45:17.200]   Clearly this is also wrong, right?
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:20.800]   And again, I'm not going to go through the doctrine of justification.
[00:45:20.800 --> 00:45:24.080]   We've been going through this, you know, for months and months and months through the Book
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:26.860]   of Romans.
[00:45:26.860 --> 00:45:31.040]   Some have differentiated between people who are only saved but is lacking baptism of the
[00:45:31.040 --> 00:45:32.040]   Holy Spirit.
[00:45:32.040 --> 00:45:38.020]   So the Pentecostals have reconciled this tension between justification and sanctification by
[00:45:38.020 --> 00:45:41.280]   there are some people who are saved, but then some people who have not been baptized by
[00:45:41.280 --> 00:45:45.480]   the Holy Spirit, so they teach the second baptism of the Holy Spirit.
[00:45:45.480 --> 00:45:49.880]   So if you happen to go to a Pentecostal church, they're always praying for a renewal of the
[00:45:49.880 --> 00:45:57.200]   Spirit, refilling of the Spirit, because they believe that that's where the tension comes,
[00:45:57.200 --> 00:46:02.160]   that there are some people who have just been saved but have not been baptized, and that's
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.520]   why they're not living in the Spirit, walking in the Spirit, or full of the Spirit.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:09.760]   And that's how they dealt with this tension.
[00:46:09.760 --> 00:46:14.280]   Some embrace this false dichotomy between born-again Christians who can identify a specific
[00:46:14.280 --> 00:46:16.760]   date for their salvation.
[00:46:16.760 --> 00:46:19.400]   So based upon Scripture, all these...
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:29.400]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
