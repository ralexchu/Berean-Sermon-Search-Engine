[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   The saying is trustworthy if anyone aspires to the office of overseer, he desires a noble
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:10.320]   task.
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:15.120]   Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach, the husband of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled,
[00:00:15.120 --> 00:00:21.160]   respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome,
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.200]   not a lover of money.
[00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:29.080]   He must manage his own household well, with all dignity, keeping his children submissive.
[00:00:29.080 --> 00:00:32.920]   For someone does not know how to manage his own household, how will he care for God's
[00:00:32.920 --> 00:00:33.920]   church?
[00:00:33.920 --> 00:00:38.120]   He must not be a recent convert, or he may become puffed up and conceited and fall into
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.000]   the condemnation of the devil.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.520]   Moreover, he must be well thought of by outsiders so that he may not fall into disgrace, into
[00:00:44.520 --> 00:00:46.400]   a snare of the devil.
[00:00:46.400 --> 00:00:48.800]   Let's pray.
[00:00:48.800 --> 00:00:51.740]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for this morning.
[00:00:51.740 --> 00:00:56.400]   We thank you, Lord God, for the privilege that we have to be able to call you our Abba
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:00:57.880]   Father.
[00:00:57.880 --> 00:01:06.000]   Help us, Lord God, to not to live our lives, Lord, just being distant from you.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.520]   Help us, Lord God, to make Christ our primary concern, primary pursuit.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:17.680]   And so we ask that this morning as we dive into your word, as we take time of communion,
[00:01:17.680 --> 00:01:22.680]   Lord, I pray, Lord God, you will gather our church together, that our commitment and our
[00:01:22.680 --> 00:01:25.080]   love for you may be united.
[00:01:25.080 --> 00:01:32.620]   And so we pray, Father God, that it would not simply be comfort or ease that we seek,
[00:01:32.620 --> 00:01:37.880]   but the truth, that we would pick up our cross and follow you.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:39.440]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing.
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:42.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:49.800]   As you guys know, the week before that, I went out to China to visit our team, and this
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:54.560]   week Tony went, and so we're very encouraged by the work that they're doing, and they're
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.000]   settling down, and so I'm communicating with them to see what's going on, and they've been
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.840]   busy just following up, and Andy sent pictures just last night, and they're following up
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:08.560]   on the students that we met this summer, and how they're continuing to meet up with them.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:11.320]   So we're really encouraged by the work that's going on over there.
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:17.280]   And the second part of the week I was out in Korea, I was attending a North Korean,
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:21.760]   a compassion that's preparing the churches in Korea to go into North Korea when it opens
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:22.760]   up.
[00:02:22.760 --> 00:02:28.800]   And so I spent a few days listening to many sermons and encouragements to prepare the
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.040]   churches to get into North Korea, and a lot of the bigger churches in this area was also
[00:02:34.040 --> 00:02:36.480]   represented in this conference.
[00:02:36.480 --> 00:02:43.440]   And a theme that really was encouraging to me was that each one of the pastors who came
[00:02:43.440 --> 00:02:49.080]   up was pleading with the churches in Korea that before we enter into North Korea, there
[00:02:49.080 --> 00:02:54.240]   needs to be a revival in the churches now, because if North Korea opens up, and all we're
[00:02:54.240 --> 00:02:57.640]   doing is sending finances, then we've missed the whole point.
[00:02:57.640 --> 00:03:00.880]   And obviously the work of compassion is to reach out to the underprivileged children,
[00:03:00.880 --> 00:03:05.800]   to feed them and care for them, but their ultimate goal is much more beyond that.
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:09.520]   It's obviously to reach them with the gospel of Jesus Christ, and so what they're hoping
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.920]   to do is that they would prepare the churches in Korea that when, and if and when it opens
[00:03:15.920 --> 00:03:21.000]   up, that the churches will be established in various places out of North Korea, and
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.520]   then that compassion will be able to work through the churches to reach out to the children.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:29.760]   And when I went to Philippines, I can honestly tell you that the work that they're doing
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:33.960]   is very effective, that they're not just feeding the children, they're actually establishing
[00:03:33.960 --> 00:03:35.520]   the local churches.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.240]   And you see a countless number of children come into Christ, and as a result of them
[00:03:40.240 --> 00:03:44.400]   coming to Christ, their mother, father, a lot of their siblings end up coming to Christ,
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:48.120]   and it's really transforming that whole area.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.080]   Even though it's in the name of the mercy ministry, the gospel is really penetrating
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.520]   into this area through their ministry.
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:03:57.680]   And so that's what they're hoping to do in North Korea.
[00:03:57.680 --> 00:04:02.680]   But the constant theme that I heard throughout the conference was that unless there is a
[00:04:02.680 --> 00:04:08.160]   revival in the Korean churches, in particular because it was a gathering of the Korean churches,
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:12.640]   unless there was a revival in the Korean church, all that's going to happen is we're going
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:17.040]   to enter into North Korea and spread nominal Christianity.
[00:04:17.040 --> 00:04:21.360]   That we know how to do church, we know how to establish the organization of a church,
[00:04:21.360 --> 00:04:26.120]   we know how to get people gathered in the church, we know we can read the Bible, anybody
[00:04:26.120 --> 00:04:29.440]   can read the Bible, we can run programs in the church, we can run Sunday school in the
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.640]   church, but no power.
[00:04:33.640 --> 00:04:38.720]   Just as the scripture says, to have a form of godliness, everything that physically looks
[00:04:38.720 --> 00:04:42.120]   like a church, we know how to do it, and we know how to do it well.
[00:04:42.120 --> 00:04:46.560]   Maybe better than any other generation that has ever lived because of technology, because
[00:04:46.560 --> 00:04:54.200]   of education, because of experience, and yet not knowing anything of its power.
[00:04:54.200 --> 00:05:00.280]   And I can say, you know, I look at the Korean churches, because you know, just coming back
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:07.560]   from there, that the previous generation, you know, was known to be theologically chaotic.
[00:05:07.560 --> 00:05:13.200]   You know, because it was established by missionaries, it was established by people who weren't properly
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:16.760]   theologically trained, but they had passion.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:20.880]   You know, they sacrificed, they suffered, many of them were martyred, put into jail
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:26.160]   during various periods of Christian history in Korea.
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.480]   But now that the theology is starting to settle in, and there's more and more good teaching,
[00:05:32.480 --> 00:05:38.760]   for whatever the reason, along with the good teaching, the passion, the sacrifice, is no
[00:05:38.760 --> 00:05:41.960]   longer the same as the previous generation.
[00:05:41.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   And so I think that it describes the church situation well.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:50.780]   That they have a form of godliness, the form is spectacular.
[00:05:50.780 --> 00:05:54.520]   They know how to do church, they know how to put in programs, you walk into a church,
[00:05:54.520 --> 00:06:01.520]   and the welcome team, and song and dance, I mean, the church is run like a Fortune 500
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.520]   company, I mean, everything is done so professionally.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:11.560]   But at the heart of the church, what really matters, the worship, is dry.
[00:06:11.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   And you could see that there's no expectation of the people who are entering.
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:21.200]   And so it was really encouraging to me, and touching to me, when the pastors were pleading.
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.640]   And this was, again, this was a conference of mostly pastors and leaders in the church,
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:30.600]   and one pastor in particular that I remember, he was pleading in tears with the church,
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.560]   saying, "Yes, we need the gospel to go into North Korea.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:38.760]   Yes, the churches need to gather together in our resources, and we have great work ahead
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:39.760]   of us.
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:44.520]   But until there is revival in the Korean churches, all we're going to end up doing is to spread
[00:06:44.520 --> 00:06:45.760]   nominal Christianity."
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:53.480]   So, you know, obviously I'm not in Korea, and being a pastor here, and I started thinking
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:55.360]   about us as well.
[00:06:55.360 --> 00:07:00.480]   You know, we, I think, I'm so excited about the work that God is doing, the opportunities
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:02.600]   that God is opening up for us.
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:08.160]   But in our generation, in where we are believers and followers of Jesus Christ, the work in
[00:07:08.160 --> 00:07:12.720]   India, in China, in various things that we are participating in, in all the work that
[00:07:12.720 --> 00:07:21.360]   you and I are doing, are we in danger of multiplying nominal Christianity?
[00:07:21.360 --> 00:07:25.100]   Are we truly making disciples of Jesus Christ?
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:30.440]   I think that the core of revival is always leadership.
[00:07:30.440 --> 00:07:31.480]   It's always leadership.
[00:07:31.480 --> 00:07:34.760]   Before we look at the congregation, before we look at anything else, we have to look
[00:07:34.760 --> 00:07:37.280]   at the leadership.
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:41.480]   If you look at church history, if you look at Old Testament history, whenever Israel
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:46.040]   begins to stray away from God, God doesn't raise up an army.
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:48.320]   He doesn't raise up a whole generation of people.
[00:07:48.320 --> 00:07:53.000]   He usually has a few people, and oftentimes one person.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.200]   And you see that in the book of Judges.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:08:00.880]   You know, when every time Israel begins to stray, He doesn't raise up a clan of people.
[00:08:00.880 --> 00:08:06.880]   He has one judge, who God is speaking to, and they begin to speak the truth in boldness,
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.360]   no matter what the cost, and God brings revival through that individual.
[00:08:12.360 --> 00:08:17.080]   The scripture is very clear about the importance of leadership.
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.760]   To be able to speak, to be able to represent God clearly.
[00:08:22.760 --> 00:08:29.240]   In Hosea, when the nation of Israel began to prostitute themselves to the idols, one
[00:08:29.240 --> 00:08:34.000]   of the statements that he makes in the book of Hosea is, in Hosea 4.9, "Like people, like
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.640]   priests."
[00:08:35.640 --> 00:08:39.640]   The reason why people went astray is because the priests went astray.
[00:08:39.640 --> 00:08:45.920]   The reason why people were not focused on God is because the priests began to compromise.
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:47.640]   Leadership is extremely important.
[00:08:47.640 --> 00:08:54.800]   That's why the scripture says in James chapter 3.1, "Not many of you ought to be leaders,
[00:08:54.800 --> 00:09:00.040]   because there's going to be stricter judgment, that there's greater consequences when leaders
[00:09:00.040 --> 00:09:05.780]   fail, and greater fruit if leaders succeed."
[00:09:05.780 --> 00:09:14.200]   And so desiring and wanting to be in leadership is not something that we should consider flippantly.
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:17.880]   Now why am I saying all of this, you know, on Father's Day?
[00:09:17.880 --> 00:09:20.280]   Why am I saying this on Father's Day?
[00:09:20.280 --> 00:09:25.960]   Because every qualification that is mentioned here in 1 Timothy chapter 3, these are not
[00:09:25.960 --> 00:09:31.520]   qualifications that are uniquely gifted to particular people in the church.
[00:09:31.520 --> 00:09:35.980]   All he's saying is, all of these qualities are qualities that make a Christian brother
[00:09:35.980 --> 00:09:38.980]   or sister.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:43.220]   You know, oftentimes if you go to the Christian bookstores, you'll find tons of books on how
[00:09:43.220 --> 00:09:45.560]   to be a great father, how to be a great husband.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:46.560]   There's tons of books.
[00:09:46.560 --> 00:09:51.880]   In fact, you'll find more books on how to become a good father than actual Bible study
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   material.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:54.240]   And I'm not exaggerating.
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:09:58.000]   I actually went out and looked and looking for Bible study material that actually studies
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:01.880]   the Bible verse by verse, and there's very few material out there.
[00:10:01.880 --> 00:10:07.680]   But you'll find tons of books on how to become a great father, how to be a good husband.
[00:10:07.680 --> 00:10:15.200]   See, but the qualification, the attributes of what makes a great leader as a deacon or
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:20.880]   an overseer, in particular in our text, is no different for every individual.
[00:10:20.880 --> 00:10:25.360]   It's just saying that the elders need to be an example of all of this.
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:28.220]   You know, whenever we talk about, you know, we go into marriage counseling, we say, "Well,
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:30.720]   what does it mean to be a godly husband, godly father?"
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:35.280]   Now, obviously their application may be a little bit different because you have a wife
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.360]   and you have children, you may be discipling them different.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:42.000]   But the attributes, the character is no different.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:46.520]   The character of a godly man is a character of a godly leader.
[00:10:46.520 --> 00:10:51.320]   So everything that he says here is really relevant to all of us.
[00:10:51.320 --> 00:10:57.280]   In particular, as we're talking about what does it mean to be a godly father, a godly
[00:10:57.280 --> 00:10:58.280]   husband.
[00:10:58.280 --> 00:11:04.600]   You know, if you look at this text, he begins by saying, "Here are the qualifications of
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:05.600]   an elder."
[00:11:05.600 --> 00:11:08.480]   And he says, "The saying is trustworthy.
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:13.080]   If anyone aspires to be an officer of an overseer, he desires a noble task.
[00:11:13.080 --> 00:11:16.320]   Therefore, an overseer must be above reproach."
[00:11:16.320 --> 00:11:20.200]   Now, above reproach basically means that in every aspect of his life that he can't be
[00:11:20.200 --> 00:11:22.000]   accused of wrongdoing.
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Right?
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:24.480]   Now, that's a pretty high calling.
[00:11:24.480 --> 00:11:31.040]   He begins by giving an overarching statement saying that you can't just be qualified in
[00:11:31.040 --> 00:11:32.040]   one.
[00:11:32.040 --> 00:11:35.920]   You could be able to teach, but you're not temperate.
[00:11:35.920 --> 00:11:36.920]   Right?
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:41.000]   And you could, you're not a drunkard, but you have love of money.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.920]   He's saying that obviously no human being is perfect, only Christ is perfect.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:52.580]   But our goal in our sanctification, in our pursuit of Christ, ought to be all-encompassing.
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.560]   If we're not careful, we can easily say, "You know what?
[00:11:54.560 --> 00:11:56.360]   I'm good at this."
[00:11:56.360 --> 00:12:01.500]   Sometimes people who are good at theology, you know, are not good at evangelism.
[00:12:01.500 --> 00:12:06.640]   And sometimes people who are good at praying may not be good at serving.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:10.760]   Sometimes people may be gracious, but they don't speak the truth.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.320]   And so we tend to cling to things that we're good at.
[00:12:13.320 --> 00:12:18.520]   So if you spend a lot of time in mercy ministry, you know, and we become like, "Oh, you know,
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:21.280]   mercy ministry, how come nobody else is helping with mercy ministry?"
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:25.160]   And then we neglect grace, mercy, theology, and all these other things that the Scripture
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:27.120]   teaches us.
[00:12:27.120 --> 00:12:31.080]   So the first thing that he says, he must be above reproach in all of these things, that
[00:12:31.080 --> 00:12:33.900]   we need to be pursuing all of these things.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:38.880]   We won't ever be perfect, but we ought to be sanctified in all of it.
[00:12:38.880 --> 00:12:44.300]   But the very first statement, very first specific statement that he makes of what it means to
[00:12:44.300 --> 00:12:46.680]   be above reproach, what does he say?
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.000]   He must be a husband of one wife.
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:54.960]   Some people have misinterpreted that as saying, well, he's saying that if you want to be a
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:57.480]   leader in the church, you have to be married.
[00:12:57.480 --> 00:13:01.960]   And I've actually talked to friends whose policy in their church is if you're not married,
[00:13:01.960 --> 00:13:04.000]   you can't be a leader in the church.
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.080]   I don't think that that's what he's saying because Apostle Paul himself is not married
[00:13:08.080 --> 00:13:09.620]   when he's writing this.
[00:13:09.620 --> 00:13:13.560]   Some think that maybe he was married and his wife left him because he was being crazy talking
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:15.200]   about Jesus, right?
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:16.860]   And some people think that.
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:20.800]   But we know for a fact that Paul himself says that he is not married.
[00:13:20.800 --> 00:13:26.240]   He says in 1 Corinthians 7 that if I were you, I would encourage you to be like me,
[00:13:26.240 --> 00:13:29.280]   meaning he doesn't have he doesn't have a divided attention.
[00:13:29.280 --> 00:13:34.640]   He has soul, you know, affections and soul attention on Christ.
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.400]   So I don't think that's what he's saying, because Paul himself, he refers him to himself
[00:13:39.400 --> 00:13:42.440]   as an overseer and as an elder.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:48.680]   Then what does he mean when he says that an elder or leader must be a husband of one wife?
[00:13:48.680 --> 00:13:52.760]   Again, you have to understand that we're living in a period of time or they're living in a
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:56.560]   period of time where prostitution was normal.
[00:13:56.560 --> 00:14:01.880]   Today, whether you're a Christian or non-Christian, prostitution is not considered a moral behavior.
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.680]   You don't have to be a Christian to say that.
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:09.400]   Non-Christians will agree with us that prostitution is not moral behavior.
[00:14:09.400 --> 00:14:13.040]   At this particular time in history, prostitution was a given.
[00:14:13.040 --> 00:14:19.960]   If a man is at home and he's not satisfied with his one wife or maybe even his concubines,
[00:14:19.960 --> 00:14:27.440]   he will be free to go to the local temple and just buy a prostitute and do what he does
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:29.320]   and then come home.
[00:14:29.320 --> 00:14:32.760]   It was not only legal, it was accepted.
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:38.600]   In fact, it would be probably difficult to find somebody who didn't practice this.
[00:14:38.600 --> 00:14:43.200]   He's speaking in that context where this is uniquely Christian, where he's saying, if
[00:14:43.200 --> 00:14:48.640]   you've made a vow as a follower of Christ and you made a vow to your wife, that you
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:51.320]   would keep that vow.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:56.120]   What he means is, he's talking about an individual who is faithful to the things that he has
[00:14:56.120 --> 00:14:59.000]   committed himself to.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:03.520]   Every single person in this room, or not every single person, but all of you who were married
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:07.440]   at Berean, you confessed the same vow.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:12.480]   And I know for a fact, Joe and Laura were the first ones at our church that got married.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:16.040]   And the vows that they took are the vows that everybody else took.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:18.000]   At least it's the same vow.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.560]   I'm pretty sure that Pastor Mark and Pastor Aaron, at least while they were here, they
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:24.560]   gave the same vow.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:28.720]   So the vows that you took, you men in particular, I'm going to read it back to you, just so
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:31.320]   that you didn't forget.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:32.720]   Okay?
[00:15:32.720 --> 00:15:41.600]   I, man, take woman as my lawfully wedded wife.
[00:15:41.600 --> 00:15:47.160]   I promise to love her sacrificially as Christ loved the church.
[00:15:47.160 --> 00:15:48.160]   Remember that.
[00:15:48.160 --> 00:15:49.160]   Right?
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:57.200]   Every single guy who stood and took that vow is that you vowed to love sacrificially.
[00:15:57.200 --> 00:16:01.000]   Not just love because they love us and because they're doing things for us.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:03.280]   It's sacrificially as Christ loved the church.
[00:16:03.280 --> 00:16:04.440]   Every one of us made that vow.
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:08.760]   I will protect and provide for her to the best of my ability.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:13.600]   Not to live selfishly, but that you would be a man and provide and take care of your
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:15.720]   home, sacrificially.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:20.720]   To the best of my ability from this day forward, for better or for worse, for richer or for
[00:16:20.720 --> 00:16:25.320]   poorer, in sickness and in health, till death do us part.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:32.080]   So what Paul is saying here is that an overseer, an leader, must first be a man who takes his
[00:16:32.080 --> 00:16:34.680]   vow seriously.
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:37.680]   That his yes is yes and his no is no.
[00:16:37.680 --> 00:16:40.800]   That he's not a man who confesses one thing with his mouth and does something else with
[00:16:40.800 --> 00:16:43.040]   his life.
[00:16:43.040 --> 00:16:47.280]   And so even in our church, every member in our church signs a covenant.
[00:16:47.280 --> 00:16:51.120]   And again, that covenant is not unique to Berean Community Church.
[00:16:51.120 --> 00:16:55.280]   Nothing on that covenant, none of the 10 covenants that we ask you to commit to is unique to
[00:16:55.280 --> 00:16:56.280]   Berean Community Church.
[00:16:56.280 --> 00:17:02.280]   It is a covenant that is required that every Christian that has a personal relationship
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.820]   with Jesus Christ enters into and we ask you to renew that covenant every year.
[00:17:07.820 --> 00:17:14.360]   So when he says an overseer is a man who takes his vow seriously, is that when he commits
[00:17:14.360 --> 00:17:17.600]   to something, he is committed.
[00:17:17.600 --> 00:17:20.800]   That he's not just one thing with his mouth and then again, it's just like, well, that
[00:17:20.800 --> 00:17:21.800]   doesn't mean anything.
[00:17:21.800 --> 00:17:26.320]   I just, you know, what he says and what he does doesn't really match up.
[00:17:26.320 --> 00:17:29.880]   So the first thing that he says, well, where is that proven?
[00:17:29.880 --> 00:17:32.160]   In his home.
[00:17:32.160 --> 00:17:39.240]   First and foremost, a man who is above reproach is a man who takes his vow seriously.
[00:17:39.240 --> 00:17:42.360]   So this morning I want to look at three things.
[00:17:42.360 --> 00:17:43.360]   Why?
[00:17:43.360 --> 00:17:44.360]   Look in verse 4 and 5.
[00:17:44.360 --> 00:17:49.480]   After he goes through that these are the qualifications of an elder, he says he must manage his own
[00:17:49.480 --> 00:17:52.960]   household well.
[00:17:52.960 --> 00:17:58.960]   If you look at the qualifications of an elder, everything that he says is a character.
[00:17:58.960 --> 00:18:05.560]   And we oftentimes take that one statement, able to teach and say, well, an elder has
[00:18:05.560 --> 00:18:09.520]   to be, you know, he needs to be sober minded, self-controlled, respectful, hospitable, not
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:10.600]   drunkard.
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:12.880]   And then we say, well, one ability he's able to teach.
[00:18:12.880 --> 00:18:19.160]   I don't think able to teach is simply talking about a skill to be able to articulate doctrine.
[00:18:19.160 --> 00:18:22.000]   I think that also is talking about character.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:27.560]   If there's any particular thing that the scripture says, like he needs to be skilled at, I think
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:28.880]   he's talking about in verse 4.
[00:18:28.880 --> 00:18:33.720]   He must be able to manage his own household well.
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:37.920]   With all dignity, keeping his children submissive, for if someone does not know how to manage
[00:18:37.920 --> 00:18:41.440]   his own household, how will he care for God's church?
[00:18:41.440 --> 00:18:48.080]   So I'm going to go through three reasons why an elder must first be a good husband or a
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:50.720]   good father.
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:56.820]   Because at the core of what makes you qualified to lead a church, he says is first and foremost,
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:18:58.280]   you need to be a good father.
[00:18:58.280 --> 00:19:00.040]   You need to be a good husband.
[00:19:00.040 --> 00:19:01.040]   And three reasons.
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:08.800]   One, the home is the most and best place to prove your character.
[00:19:08.800 --> 00:19:13.560]   The home is the most, is the best place to prove your character.
[00:19:13.560 --> 00:19:16.520]   See, look at all the characteristics that are mentioned here.
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.720]   He must be sober minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:27.760]   a drunkard, not violent, but gentle, not quarrelsome, not a lover of money.
[00:19:27.760 --> 00:19:30.320]   Now this morning here, you know, it's 11 o'clock.
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:34.800]   So if you are drowsy at 11 o'clock, you are sleeping way too late.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:35.800]   Right?
[00:19:35.800 --> 00:19:39.720]   Or maybe you have an infant at home and so you have a good excuse.
[00:19:39.720 --> 00:19:44.400]   But if that's not the case, you should prepare yourself.
[00:19:44.400 --> 00:19:45.400]   Right?
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:51.480]   Now as a pastor, I've been preaching here for many years, so I can kind of tell if you
[00:19:51.480 --> 00:19:53.120]   guys are paying attention or not paying attention.
[00:19:53.120 --> 00:19:54.920]   Some of you are better than others.
[00:19:54.920 --> 00:19:59.120]   You know, the older you are, the better you are at faking it.
[00:19:59.120 --> 00:20:00.120]   That's what I noticed.
[00:20:00.120 --> 00:20:03.640]   And you know, when I preach in front of older people, like people in their 40s and 50s and
[00:20:03.640 --> 00:20:05.400]   60s, I mean, they got a straight face.
[00:20:05.400 --> 00:20:08.680]   You know, they're saying straight out, they might even say amen every once in a while,
[00:20:08.680 --> 00:20:10.200]   but they're not paying attention.
[00:20:10.200 --> 00:20:11.200]   Right?
[00:20:11.200 --> 00:20:16.320]   But the younger you are, you know, because I don't, many of you are surprised when I
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:18.480]   tell you what I notice up here.
[00:20:18.480 --> 00:20:20.280]   Like, oh, you came in late.
[00:20:20.280 --> 00:20:21.280]   So you saw that?
[00:20:21.280 --> 00:20:22.280]   Of course I saw you.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:23.280]   You just walked down the middle.
[00:20:23.280 --> 00:20:24.280]   I saw you.
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:25.280]   Right?
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:26.280]   You were drinking coffee.
[00:20:26.280 --> 00:20:28.040]   You know, oh, you were falling asleep.
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:29.240]   Oh, shoot, you saw that?
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:31.520]   Of course I can see that.
[00:20:31.520 --> 00:20:32.520]   Right?
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:33.520]   I can tell.
[00:20:33.520 --> 00:20:35.920]   But all of those things are superficial.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:36.920]   You can fake it.
[00:20:36.920 --> 00:20:37.920]   Right?
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:39.200]   Some of you may not be paying attention at all.
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.320]   You have no idea what I said up to this point.
[00:20:41.320 --> 00:20:42.320]   Right?
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   You just drank coffee, so you're just not falling asleep.
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:46.320]   Right?
[00:20:46.320 --> 00:20:49.760]   Now, I've spoken in front of junior high school students where they just straight up lied
[00:20:49.760 --> 00:20:50.760]   down and went to sleep.
[00:20:50.760 --> 00:20:51.760]   Right?
[00:20:51.760 --> 00:20:52.760]   You guys aren't that bad.
[00:20:52.760 --> 00:20:53.760]   Right?
[00:20:53.760 --> 00:20:55.560]   But you can fake it.
[00:20:55.560 --> 00:20:59.120]   Not just with me, but even with each other.
[00:20:59.120 --> 00:21:03.040]   Whether you're sober or not sober, whether your mind is filled with things of this world,
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.480]   whether you are passionately pursuing God, what is in your heart, on Sunday morning,
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:11.560]   for a couple hours, we can all fake it.
[00:21:11.560 --> 00:21:14.040]   We can all put on a good face.
[00:21:14.040 --> 00:21:15.520]   You know, we all dressed up.
[00:21:15.520 --> 00:21:18.560]   Nobody came out, you know, just rolled out of bed with your hair all sticking up, you
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:19.560]   know.
[00:21:19.560 --> 00:21:21.940]   You all prepared yourself to come.
[00:21:21.940 --> 00:21:27.880]   So Sundays are not the best place to judge whether somebody is sober or not sober.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.240]   But you can't fake it at home.
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:33.080]   You can't fake it at home.
[00:21:33.080 --> 00:21:39.680]   No matter what the reputation is at church, your husband, your wife knows.
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:42.240]   If you're reading the Bible, not reading the Bible.
[00:21:42.240 --> 00:21:44.660]   If you've been in prayer or not been in prayer.
[00:21:44.660 --> 00:21:48.920]   If you're sober or not sober, your wife knows.
[00:21:48.920 --> 00:21:53.280]   You can fake it for a short period of time, but not for long.
[00:21:53.280 --> 00:21:54.280]   Self-controlled.
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:55.280]   Are you self-controlled?
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:21:59.520]   Are you giving yourself, of course, you know, every single one of you here is self-controlled.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.160]   Nobody's standing up saying, you know, doing whatever your flesh desires on Sunday morning.
[00:22:05.160 --> 00:22:09.840]   You get into your car, you know, when the pastor's not there, when the leaders are not
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:14.340]   there and your Christian friends are not there, right?
[00:22:14.340 --> 00:22:16.480]   You just kind of give in to whatever desires that you have.
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:18.880]   You can't tell at church.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:25.680]   In fact, the longer you've been a Christian, the more, you know, the better you are at
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:27.240]   presenting yourself on Sunday.
[00:22:27.240 --> 00:22:28.840]   You know what you should say or shouldn't say.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:31.920]   That's why when a young Christian comes into the church, it's so refreshing.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:34.800]   You know, things that come out of their mouth, they're like, oh my gosh, but they don't know
[00:22:34.800 --> 00:22:35.800]   any better.
[00:22:35.800 --> 00:22:36.800]   Right?
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:38.520]   But they're just, they're just, they're just honest.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:40.160]   You see who they are.
[00:22:40.160 --> 00:22:44.960]   But the longer we've been a Christian, we know how you should dress, what not to wear,
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.040]   what to say, what not to say, you know, like the Trinity and the church.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:22:56.880]   I mean, we know how to play this game, but the true test of a character, you can see
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:23:00.640]   with the people who are the closest to you, which is at home.
[00:23:00.640 --> 00:23:02.760]   You know, the older we get, we know how to play this game.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:08.160]   You know, if Esther cooks something that I think maybe it's too salty or it's not salty
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:09.160]   enough.
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:13.280]   And she asked me, and I try to be as honest with her as possible, but, but I know, like,
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:18.120]   I don't want to hurt her and I don't want to hurt myself.
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.560]   So I try to be careful, right?
[00:23:21.560 --> 00:23:24.420]   But you can't fool your kids.
[00:23:24.420 --> 00:23:26.120]   You can't fool your kids.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:29.160]   You know, if you prepared a meal and your kids don't like it, especially the younger
[00:23:29.160 --> 00:23:31.120]   they are, you know what I mean?
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:35.760]   Like the older ones at my house, like Jeremy, he kind of knows he's, he's 18.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:38.040]   So he's, he knows how to play the game.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:43.000]   So you don't, but you take younger kids.
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.880]   I don't want to eat this.
[00:23:44.880 --> 00:23:47.160]   Your mom's been laboring for three hours to cook this.
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:48.800]   It's like, yeah, but I don't want it.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:52.760]   You know, whoever you are, whatever you are, you can't fake it at home.
[00:23:52.760 --> 00:23:57.220]   You can't fake it with your wife and you definitely can't fake it with your kids.
[00:23:57.220 --> 00:24:00.640]   Your kids will tell you right away who you are.
[00:24:00.640 --> 00:24:03.520]   You know, they'll hurt you if you ask them.
[00:24:03.520 --> 00:24:06.560]   Don't ask questions that you don't want the answers to, right?
[00:24:06.560 --> 00:24:08.320]   They'll hurt you, right?
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:11.120]   Because they're brutally honest.
[00:24:11.120 --> 00:24:14.800]   You can fake it outside, but you can't fake it at home.
[00:24:14.800 --> 00:24:19.200]   And to be a leader, that's why he says, first and foremost, you have to be a leader at home.
[00:24:19.200 --> 00:24:23.680]   You have to be a father who is respected at home.
[00:24:23.680 --> 00:24:31.080]   I remember years ago, the very first ministry I was a youth pastor in, and this pastor was
[00:24:31.080 --> 00:24:33.660]   a, in my mind, was a great preacher.
[00:24:33.660 --> 00:24:35.940]   They had, it was a Korean church and I was a youth pastor.
[00:24:35.940 --> 00:24:38.440]   So every morning at 5.30, there was morning prayer.
[00:24:38.440 --> 00:24:44.240]   So it wasn't required, but I enjoyed going because the pastor was such a great preacher
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:46.040]   and he was preaching through Leviticus.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.960]   I thought this guy was crazy.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:53.300]   You know, he's preaching Leviticus 5.30 in the morning, you know, but I was gaining so
[00:24:53.300 --> 00:24:55.720]   much and I thought, man, this, this was a brand new church.
[00:24:55.720 --> 00:24:57.000]   Finally, it's going to explode.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:02.460]   People are going to come and, and this church is going to grow quickly.
[00:25:02.460 --> 00:25:06.680]   I remember one day I was at his house and we were having a meeting and we're having
[00:25:06.680 --> 00:25:09.940]   a meeting and you could tell his wife was not happy.
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:11.320]   Something was going on.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:15.160]   And every time the pastor would say something, you could, you could see in the, in the pastor's
[00:25:15.160 --> 00:25:18.480]   wife's face, like, "Yeah, right."
[00:25:18.480 --> 00:25:19.480]   You know?
[00:25:19.480 --> 00:25:23.360]   And so, you know, as the night went by, you could just see the tension between the husband
[00:25:23.360 --> 00:25:28.600]   and wife to the extent where everything that he said was nullified by the expression of
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:29.600]   his wife's face.
[00:25:29.600 --> 00:25:33.360]   I don't know what was going on at home, you know, and I was a, I was pretty young.
[00:25:33.360 --> 00:25:37.360]   I was 19, 20 years old at that time, so, you know, I don't know the dynamics of marriage
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:42.120]   and all that stuff, but I just remember the picture that I had of the pastor at the church
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:48.400]   and the picture I had of him at home was night and day.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:55.620]   Who we are in private gives us the foundation to be able to be who we are in public.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:26:01.520]   But if our public life and private life does not match, eventually we will be disqualified.
[00:26:01.520 --> 00:26:06.000]   That's why in 1 Timothy 5, 22, it says, "Do not be hasty in laying hands of others, nor
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:07.560]   take part in the sins of others.
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   Keep yourself pure."
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:15.440]   And then he says, "Some sins are obvious, but some sins trail behind them."
[00:26:15.440 --> 00:26:18.500]   What that means is, they may look godly.
[00:26:18.500 --> 00:26:24.180]   They may look a certain way in the front, because everybody knows how to play this game.
[00:26:24.180 --> 00:26:29.280]   But if there is hidden sin, if someone is not gracious at home, if he is not a proven
[00:26:29.280 --> 00:26:34.320]   to be a leader at home, eventually it will leak out.
[00:26:34.320 --> 00:26:38.900]   And that's why he says, "Take your time to test a person.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:44.200]   Take your time to see the inside and the out."
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:50.080]   Second reason why, he says, "This is a place where we learn to lead."
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:54.040]   And so, leadership is not just something that, you know, in character, but again, he's talking
[00:26:54.040 --> 00:26:59.800]   about he needs to be able to manage his own household, that the children must be submissive
[00:26:59.800 --> 00:27:02.320]   in all dignity, right?
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.440]   Having respect for his father.
[00:27:04.440 --> 00:27:05.740]   Why is that important?
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.360]   If he can't earn the respect of his children at home, how is he going to earn the respect
[00:27:09.360 --> 00:27:12.080]   of the members at the church?
[00:27:12.080 --> 00:27:14.720]   He must be proven, first and foremost, at home.
[00:27:14.720 --> 00:27:20.600]   Now, John MacArthur says, of leadership, there are three qualities that every leader needs
[00:27:20.600 --> 00:27:23.120]   to have, whether it is at home or whether it is at church.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:26.480]   One, he needs to be able to have authority.
[00:27:26.480 --> 00:27:28.000]   That he speaks with authority.
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:31.680]   Authority obviously at church comes from the Word of God, right?
[00:27:31.680 --> 00:27:34.960]   But it doesn't only come from the Word of God, because you can be speaking the truth
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:41.000]   of the Word of God, and your life in the pulpit and outside the pulpit don't match, then you
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   are disqualified to teach.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   So a person who is articulate and give great messages can go from church to church to church,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:55.280]   and give great messages and be honored, saying, "Wow, you are a man of God."
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.440]   But somebody who is in the church day in and day out, where they know your private life
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:03.840]   and your public life, if your life does not match the things that you are preaching up
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:09.240]   in the pulpit, eventually no one is going to care what you have to say.
[00:28:09.240 --> 00:28:10.240]   You become disqualified.
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:14.720]   That's why I believe that statement, "able to teach," is not simply talking about the
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.800]   ability to articulate truth.
[00:28:17.800 --> 00:28:25.200]   Able to teach is that his character, his life, his theology, all of that are consistent.
[00:28:25.200 --> 00:28:28.120]   Therefore he is able to teach.
[00:28:28.120 --> 00:28:34.840]   So that's why he says, if you can't disciple and bring a child to submission, and because
[00:28:34.840 --> 00:28:39.280]   you have authority over his life, you're not going to be able to disciple that child.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.920]   Secondly, he says, there needs to be wisdom.
[00:28:42.920 --> 00:28:45.400]   Wisdom as to when to squeeze, when to let go.
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:48.000]   And that's the same thing at church.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   When to preach the truth, when to preach love, when to demand holiness, when to be gracious.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:57.480]   There needs to be wisdom in application.
[00:28:57.480 --> 00:29:03.400]   If you are gracious when it's time to bring discipline, then you will ruin the child.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:08.160]   If you bring discipline when he needs grace, you will also ruin the child.
[00:29:08.160 --> 00:29:10.540]   And there's no different in the church.
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:12.080]   So you need to have wisdom.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:15.400]   Third, there needs to be love.
[00:29:15.400 --> 00:29:18.520]   And that's, that part, love.
[00:29:18.520 --> 00:29:22.520]   Again, this is my personal experience.
[00:29:22.520 --> 00:29:27.000]   Love tends to come and overflow from people who are broken.
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.440]   Broken people tend to be more gracious.
[00:29:30.440 --> 00:29:32.880]   Broken people tend to be more loving.
[00:29:32.880 --> 00:29:36.280]   And that's the difference between righteousness and self-righteousness.
[00:29:36.280 --> 00:29:42.520]   A righteous person is somebody who is broken because he recognizes his own sin, and he
[00:29:42.520 --> 00:29:44.760]   has compassion toward other sinners.
[00:29:44.760 --> 00:29:50.080]   A self-righteous person is a person who doesn't recognize his own faults.
[00:29:50.080 --> 00:29:55.560]   And he sees all that he has done, and everybody else who's not living up to it, and so he
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:29:57.000]   blames everybody else.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:29:59.720]   And he has no compassion.
[00:29:59.720 --> 00:30:04.640]   A good leader, a biblical leader, must have authority, he must have wisdom, and he must
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:06.480]   have love.
[00:30:06.480 --> 00:30:11.800]   Just like children, if they only obey me because they're afraid of me, at some point they're
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:17.160]   going to stop obeying me, because at some point I'm not going to be stronger than them.
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:24.800]   Especially with today's technology, you know, creatine, amino acids, you know, they get
[00:30:24.800 --> 00:30:26.960]   big fast, right?
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:31.840]   Building up muscle, Zachary's like, you know, he's bulking up, and you know what I mean?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:34.280]   Like a couple years, he's going to flip me over.
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:39.360]   If my authority is coming from, you know, my strength, and he's afraid of me, at some
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:42.920]   point he's not going to obey me anymore.
[00:30:42.920 --> 00:30:49.360]   His authority, eventually, as they mature, comes from love.
[00:30:49.360 --> 00:30:51.760]   Because they know how much we care about them.
[00:30:51.760 --> 00:30:56.160]   That even when we speak harshly, they know we're speaking because it's what's best for
[00:30:56.160 --> 00:30:57.920]   them.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:31:01.640]   And this must be first and foremost proven at home.
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:06.840]   That we learn to be disciple makers first and foremost at home.
[00:31:06.840 --> 00:31:11.680]   You know, every stage of parenting, you know, I had to adjust, and I know there's a few
[00:31:11.680 --> 00:31:15.920]   people in this room have raised teenagers and beyond.
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:18.240]   Most of you are raising little children.
[00:31:18.240 --> 00:31:24.880]   And infancy is kind of like, you know, our church was planted, some of you guys, most
[00:31:24.880 --> 00:31:29.600]   of you guys know, but some of you guys don't know, that our church was planted on the day,
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:34.080]   not planted, but inaugurated on the day that my first son was born.
[00:31:34.080 --> 00:31:36.640]   So when he turns 18, our church turns 18.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:41.920]   And so as our church matured and grew, I can see the correlation between our church and
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:44.120]   raising Jeremy.
[00:31:44.120 --> 00:31:46.320]   Infancy is, you know, it's a shock.
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.760]   It's like everything's new, you don't know what you're doing, especially when you had
[00:31:48.760 --> 00:31:50.320]   your first kid, right?
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:53.240]   You call the doctor, every time he coughs, something went wrong.
[00:31:53.240 --> 00:31:56.320]   And it's kind of like the church plant, initially, right?
[00:31:56.320 --> 00:32:00.720]   I remember the first time doing baptism, I had no idea what I was doing, I just did it.
[00:32:00.720 --> 00:32:05.680]   I literally had to watch videos, oh, this is what they do, right?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:07.520]   It's kind of like raising a kid.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:12.880]   At toddler stage is when people just kind of start to go off and venture, and they're
[00:32:12.880 --> 00:32:16.760]   testing out everything, and you kind of have to go and sit and talk to people, it's like,
[00:32:16.760 --> 00:32:19.280]   don't do that, you can't get drunk, you can't do that.
[00:32:19.280 --> 00:32:22.440]   You're chasing after these toddlers who are sticking fingers into the walls, you can't
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:23.440]   do that, right?
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.760]   That's the toddler stage.
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:28.800]   There's a stage in the church where, in the context of discipling, you have to talk to
[00:32:28.800 --> 00:32:33.720]   them about, you can't do this, and don't go here, don't say that.
[00:32:33.720 --> 00:32:39.440]   I think the hardest stage in raising kids is probably the teenage stage.
[00:32:39.440 --> 00:32:43.920]   Because teenage stage is where they're physically big enough, and you know, they're not afraid
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.880]   of spanking, you know, that stage is done.
[00:32:46.880 --> 00:32:51.640]   If you're spanking them when they're teenagers, I don't know, maybe it works, it doesn't
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:53.640]   work, it doesn't work.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:57.640]   They're not afraid of pain, in fact, they could inflict pain if they wanted to at that
[00:32:57.640 --> 00:32:58.640]   stage, right?
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:02.440]   But teenage stage is the most difficult because they think they're adults and they're not
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.440]   yet.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:09.120]   You know, and that's the most dangerous part of the spiritual stage.
[00:33:09.120 --> 00:33:13.000]   Some of you guys are sitting there, saying, yeah, I remember those people.
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:15.440]   It might be you, okay, it might be you.
[00:33:15.440 --> 00:33:20.440]   The teenage stage is the stage when we think we're more mature than we really are, and
[00:33:20.440 --> 00:33:24.160]   that's when we're the most dangerous, you know.
[00:33:24.160 --> 00:33:27.320]   And I remember, you know, when Jeremy first started driving his car, he started having
[00:33:27.320 --> 00:33:29.880]   freedom and he was talking about how he wanted to go here.
[00:33:29.880 --> 00:33:32.600]   Obviously, now he has freedom, he can go anywhere he wants.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:36.920]   He's like going to New York and San Francisco, traveling, backpacking in Europe, and he's
[00:33:36.920 --> 00:33:41.680]   talking about all this stuff, and I said, Jeremy, you know, that's great, you know,
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:44.920]   and at some point, I will feel comfortable when you do that, I'm just going to have to
[00:33:44.920 --> 00:33:46.240]   let you go, but not today.
[00:33:46.240 --> 00:33:47.760]   And he said, why?
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:51.280]   I said, I know how to, you know, I'm grown up.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:57.400]   And I remember I asked him, if you get a flat tire, what are you going to do?
[00:33:57.400 --> 00:34:00.640]   And he looked at me like, what?
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:04.120]   If you're driving in New York and you got a flat tire, what would you do?
[00:34:04.120 --> 00:34:07.880]   Oh, I want to get a flat tire.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:11.920]   Because tires are not eternal, that's why.
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:13.920]   If you get a flat tire, what are you going to do?
[00:34:13.920 --> 00:34:16.240]   He said, well, I don't know.
[00:34:16.240 --> 00:34:20.160]   I said, exactly.
[00:34:20.160 --> 00:34:24.200]   Just a simple thing as a flat tire is going to ruin your vacation or whatever.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.640]   But that's why I'm saying, I'm not saying you can't do it, and it's a simple fix, but
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.000]   you don't know how the world works.
[00:34:29.000 --> 00:34:34.560]   You may go in with a flat tire, and you may come out with four brand new tires, right?
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:39.840]   There's an inside joke with me and Esther.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:42.280]   All right.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:45.280]   Don't hurt me later.
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:46.280]   Esther did that one time.
[00:34:46.280 --> 00:34:52.280]   I'll pay for it later.
[00:34:52.280 --> 00:34:55.720]   All right.
[00:34:55.720 --> 00:35:06.280]   That's probably the most dangerous stage, right?
[00:35:06.280 --> 00:35:08.440]   But learning to deal with that, be patient.
[00:35:08.440 --> 00:35:12.920]   During the teenage stage, you have to be patient, and you have to love them.
[00:35:12.920 --> 00:35:15.960]   It's aggravating and frustrating, but you have to kind of endure through that, because
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:17.960]   that's part of parenting.
[00:35:17.960 --> 00:35:22.840]   Whenever I hear a young guy saying, I want to be a pastor because I like to teach.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:29.080]   That's like saying, I want to be a parent because I like to read to my kids.
[00:35:29.080 --> 00:35:34.080]   A parent has to be ready to do whatever it takes.
[00:35:34.080 --> 00:35:35.560]   You have to learn how to cook.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:37.360]   You have to learn how to drive.
[00:35:37.360 --> 00:35:39.800]   Sometimes you wake up in the middle of the night, and you have to be the nurse or the
[00:35:39.800 --> 00:35:41.000]   doctor.
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:42.560]   You have to learn how to change their diapers.
[00:35:42.560 --> 00:35:44.920]   I mean, there is no one job description.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:50.160]   You don't come into a parenting and be a father and say, this is what I want to do when I'm
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.480]   a father.
[00:35:51.480 --> 00:35:54.960]   You do whatever that child needs you to be.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:57.400]   And that's no different with pastoring.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:00.920]   If you come into pastoring or leadership in the church thinking like, oh, this is what
[00:36:00.920 --> 00:36:01.920]   I'm going to do.
[00:36:01.920 --> 00:36:05.640]   Then you're not going to make it.
[00:36:05.640 --> 00:36:06.960]   So a good leader learns.
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.040]   Again, he's proven first and foremost at home.
[00:36:10.040 --> 00:36:14.880]   The third and final reason, which I believe is the most important out of the three, is
[00:36:14.880 --> 00:36:19.800]   that the curse of the law was first revealed in the home.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:24.320]   So the reversal of the curse is first practiced at home.
[00:36:24.320 --> 00:36:30.560]   If you remember in Genesis 3, verse 7, after they fall into temptation and the curse comes
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:33.880]   into mankind, this is how it's described.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:38.200]   Then the eyes of both were opened and they knew that they were naked and they sewed fig
[00:36:38.200 --> 00:36:41.960]   leaves together and made themselves loincloths.
[00:36:41.960 --> 00:36:46.840]   And then in chapter 3, verse 10 through 11, it says, and he said, Adam is speaking to
[00:36:46.840 --> 00:36:47.840]   God.
[00:36:47.840 --> 00:36:51.480]   He said, I heard the sound of you in the garden and I was afraid because I was naked and I
[00:36:51.480 --> 00:36:53.440]   hid myself.
[00:36:53.440 --> 00:36:55.520]   He said, who told you that you were naked?
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:58.260]   Have you eaten of the tree of which I commanded you not to eat?
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:05.560]   So in the three verses, this fall, this death, this curse that we talk about is described
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:09.200]   as recognizing our nakedness.
[00:37:09.200 --> 00:37:13.860]   So the first thing that we know is that nakedness is basically covering ourselves.
[00:37:13.860 --> 00:37:18.680]   Every single one of us, the most tangible evidence of the fall is that you are not naked.
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   Right?
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.600]   And you say, thank God.
[00:37:23.600 --> 00:37:26.880]   Because no animal wears clothes but us.
[00:37:26.880 --> 00:37:31.280]   The reason, again, why Mickey Mouse has pants on is because a human being drew him.
[00:37:31.280 --> 00:37:32.280]   Right?
[00:37:32.280 --> 00:37:34.440]   No mouse wears pants.
[00:37:34.440 --> 00:37:38.560]   Whenever you see a dog walking around with clothing on, you know that some person did
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:39.560]   that to that person.
[00:37:39.560 --> 00:37:42.560]   No dog woke up in the morning and said, I need to wear pants.
[00:37:42.560 --> 00:37:43.920]   Right?
[00:37:43.920 --> 00:37:44.920]   Somebody did that to them.
[00:37:44.920 --> 00:37:49.120]   So the fact that you and I dressed up this morning is the most tangible evidence of the
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.840]   fall.
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:54.820]   Because the first thing that happened was, their eyes got open and they recognized their
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.640]   nakedness and they covered themselves.
[00:37:56.640 --> 00:38:02.040]   The word naked here in Hebrew literally means shameful exposure.
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:06.600]   Why did they all of a sudden recognize, oh, it's shameful to uncover certain parts of
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:08.600]   our body?
[00:38:08.600 --> 00:38:13.080]   It was, even though it was manifested physically, it was something happening spiritually.
[00:38:13.080 --> 00:38:14.980]   They were hiding from themselves.
[00:38:14.980 --> 00:38:17.320]   And as a result of this hiding, what happened?
[00:38:17.320 --> 00:38:19.200]   Who did they hide from?
[00:38:19.200 --> 00:38:21.360]   They didn't hide from the dogs.
[00:38:21.360 --> 00:38:22.360]   They didn't hide from themselves.
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:26.080]   None of you have a problem being naked in the shower.
[00:38:26.080 --> 00:38:29.640]   You don't wear pants because you're ashamed of yourself.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.840]   Who were they hiding from?
[00:38:31.840 --> 00:38:37.440]   Adam was hiding from his wife and his wife was hiding from her husband.
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.680]   And they were hiding from their God.
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:44.760]   That's the first place where this shame is recognized.
[00:38:44.760 --> 00:38:49.560]   Where the fall was tangibly seen was between husband and wife.
[00:38:49.560 --> 00:38:51.360]   They hid themselves.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:54.280]   You know, we have a tendency to think we romanticize marriage.
[00:38:54.280 --> 00:38:58.520]   We think once we get married, you know, me and my husband, we're going to finish each
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.880]   other's sentences and we're just going to be so one.
[00:39:01.880 --> 00:39:03.360]   We'll be one.
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:06.280]   I'm going to find my eternal partner.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:08.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.000]   You get married and you realize, I mean, probably the greatest problem that husband and wife
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.080]   has is understanding each other.
[00:39:16.080 --> 00:39:17.080]   Universally.
[00:39:17.080 --> 00:39:21.600]   You know, even, forget finishing each other's sentence.
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:25.680]   You can write them a letter, draw them a picture, and they don't get you.
[00:39:25.680 --> 00:39:31.000]   You can spend hours talking about, that's not what I said.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.360]   That's not what I meant.
[00:39:33.360 --> 00:39:37.760]   You can have years of conversations like, how come you don't get it?
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.720]   You just don't get it.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:41.240]   Finish each other's sentence.
[00:39:41.240 --> 00:39:44.400]   Yeah, right.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:49.880]   The very first thing that happened between when the fall came in was that they hid from
[00:39:49.880 --> 00:39:54.240]   each other and that was the most tangible evidence.
[00:39:54.240 --> 00:39:58.880]   And as a result of that, they're first born, is born into sin, and then again and again
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:01.400]   and again.
[00:40:01.400 --> 00:40:06.880]   So when we were affected by the cross, the very first place where the reversal of this
[00:40:06.880 --> 00:40:12.880]   curse must be seen and practiced is at home.
[00:40:12.880 --> 00:40:18.040]   Before the church, before anywhere else, is with my wife and my kids.
[00:40:18.040 --> 00:40:23.980]   That all of these things that God challenges me to do, it must first be practiced at home.
[00:40:23.980 --> 00:40:27.840]   The curse has been reversed for all of us.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:34.400]   Every single one of us, because we've been born into a sinful, fallen world.
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:38.280]   You know, if you go to a psychologist, they'll say, "Oh, why do you behave that way?
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:40.000]   Why are you addicted to this?
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   And why do you do that?"
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.240]   And they'll trace your life and say, "Well, your father was an addict.
[00:40:45.240 --> 00:40:46.440]   You were abused when you were a kid."
[00:40:46.440 --> 00:40:52.520]   And we can all trace back our behavior and say, "We do this because they've done this
[00:40:52.520 --> 00:40:54.360]   to us."
[00:40:54.360 --> 00:40:57.440]   You know, "At school I was treated this way.
[00:40:57.440 --> 00:41:02.040]   You know, my parents did this, and my grandparents did that."
[00:41:02.040 --> 00:41:06.360]   Every single human being that's born into a sinful world has been sinned against, and
[00:41:06.360 --> 00:41:10.280]   so therefore, we sin.
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.720]   And there's also sin inside of us that causes us to sin.
[00:41:13.720 --> 00:41:22.020]   But no Christian, no child of God, can now use that as an excuse for our sin.
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:26.600]   Because we love, because He first loved us.
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:30.020]   Because every human being, if you kick me, I kick somebody else, and it goes on and on
[00:41:30.020 --> 00:41:31.020]   and on.
[00:41:31.020 --> 00:41:34.520]   But Jesus Christ, it says, absorbs sin upon Himself.
[00:41:34.520 --> 00:41:39.080]   And instead of bringing judgment, He brought love and grace.
[00:41:39.080 --> 00:41:43.080]   Galatians 3.13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law by becoming a curse for us,
[00:41:43.080 --> 00:41:46.520]   for it is written, 'Cursed is everyone who is hanged on a tree.'"
[00:41:46.520 --> 00:41:53.360]   He became a curse for us, that we would no longer live in response of this curse.
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:59.380]   So where is this reversal of the curse first practiced and actualized?
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.100]   With my wife.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.740]   With my husband.
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:04.960]   With my children.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:10.700]   And that's why He says an elder must first be proven in his home before he can lead in
[00:42:10.700 --> 00:42:13.300]   the congregation.
[00:42:13.300 --> 00:42:16.940]   Every single one of us have been affected.
[00:42:16.940 --> 00:42:21.160]   You can't use your husband's behavior to be a bad wife.
[00:42:21.160 --> 00:42:25.080]   You can't use your wife's behavior to be a bad husband.
[00:42:25.080 --> 00:42:29.880]   You can't use your children's sin to be a bad parent.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:34.860]   Because every single one of us hit the spiritual lottery.
[00:42:34.860 --> 00:42:40.580]   How can we possibly be complaining about a few bucks when we hit the lottery?
[00:42:40.580 --> 00:42:45.580]   When He is our Abba Father, that no matter what happens in life, that that will never
[00:42:45.580 --> 00:42:47.140]   change.
[00:42:47.140 --> 00:42:50.200]   What can separate us from this love of Christ?
[00:42:50.200 --> 00:42:55.260]   He who did not spare His own Son, how will He along with Him give us everything?
[00:42:55.260 --> 00:43:00.380]   If He is our Abba Father, how can we possibly complain about the trivial things?
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:08.500]   So therefore, therefore, because He loved me, I'm obligated.
[00:43:08.500 --> 00:43:10.380]   Because He loved me, I'm obligated to love you.
[00:43:10.380 --> 00:43:13.980]   Not because you love me, but because He loved me.
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:16.740]   I'm obligated to the non-Christians.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:22.220]   Not because they're beautiful, not because they're lovely, not because they have potential,
[00:43:22.220 --> 00:43:25.220]   but because He loved me.
[00:43:25.220 --> 00:43:30.940]   And at the core of a good marriage, at the core of a good father, He's a person who has
[00:43:30.940 --> 00:43:34.700]   been affected by the cross.
[00:43:34.700 --> 00:43:38.580]   I want to conclude with a challenge to the men in our congregation.
[00:43:38.580 --> 00:43:45.900]   Whether you are a father, whether you are married, or whether you're a single guy.
[00:43:45.900 --> 00:43:49.900]   We are in desperate need of men.
[00:43:49.900 --> 00:43:52.100]   Men.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:59.900]   Men who understand the responsibility that's not just on my shoulder as a pastor, not just
[00:43:59.900 --> 00:44:06.100]   my shoulder as a father, to set an example, but every man that has been given the authority,
[00:44:06.100 --> 00:44:14.620]   every man who takes the vow to love my wife sacrificially, to understand that revival
[00:44:14.620 --> 00:44:21.220]   will come when men experience revival in their lives.
[00:44:21.220 --> 00:44:23.140]   Men.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:25.860]   Men who's going to act like men.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:29.540]   Men who are not going to live their lives thinking about, "How can I be satisfied?
[00:44:29.540 --> 00:44:30.540]   What can I do with my life?
[00:44:30.540 --> 00:44:32.340]   How can I enjoy myself?"
[00:44:32.340 --> 00:44:36.540]   But to recognize that that responsibility for your wife, for your children, for your
[00:44:36.540 --> 00:44:43.780]   community has been placed on your shoulders, and when men become men, I believe revival
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.660]   will come.
[00:44:45.660 --> 00:44:51.660]   That we not look to the left or to the right, but each man stands before God and say, "Lord,
[00:44:51.660 --> 00:44:54.620]   hear my, send me.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:45:01.440]   What do I have to be in my home that I can make disciples of my wife and my children?"
[00:45:01.440 --> 00:45:10.340]   As we celebrate Father's Day, I pray that God would raise up men in our generation.
[00:45:10.340 --> 00:45:13.380]   Men who are going to take up their cross.
[00:45:13.380 --> 00:45:19.820]   And the aroma of Christ will be so strong in our community that our wives and our children
[00:45:19.820 --> 00:45:22.380]   may be the first benefactors.
[00:45:22.380 --> 00:45:25.380]   Let's pray.
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:35.680]   May I ask the praise team to come up as we prepare for the communion table.
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:45.440]   Just as motherhood is important and it is tiring at times and draining, and fatherhood,
[00:45:45.440 --> 00:45:47.960]   at times, could be just as draining.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:53.240]   And they need encouragement, they need your prayers, and they need grace.
[00:45:53.240 --> 00:45:57.600]   Because it is a high calling, we need the community to lift up the men in our church,
[00:45:57.600 --> 00:46:01.800]   and because we're weak, at the core of who we are, we're selfish.
