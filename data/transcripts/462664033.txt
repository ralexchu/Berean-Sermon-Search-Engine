[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.800]   All right, good morning again, everybody.
[00:00:07.800 --> 00:00:16.560]   Please take your Bibles and open up to Matthew chapter 5.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:22.720]   And as we turn there, I just want to say just a word of thanks for all the volunteers, people
[00:00:22.720 --> 00:00:26.840]   in different service teams, helping out and making things happen.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:32.440]   We've had a bunch of changes going outdoor, indoor, and then changing media things and
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:33.440]   stuff like that.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:38.200]   And I realize there's so many people involved in making things go.
[00:00:38.200 --> 00:00:40.680]   So I'm very grateful.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:46.480]   I'm also grateful because I realized I totally missed the session, a season of preaching
[00:00:46.480 --> 00:00:47.480]   outside.
[00:00:47.480 --> 00:00:51.000]   Pastor Peter had to take the bulk of preaching in the hot sun.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:52.880]   I got to be inside in the nice AC.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:54.560]   I was like, "Oh, darn."
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:59.200]   I was like, "No, it was good."
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:06.720]   As we take a look at this passage, what I'd like to do first is read verse 38 down to
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:08.600]   verse 48.
[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:15.800]   And I will be, for the sake of time, focusing on just that first paragraph from verse 38
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:20.160]   through 42, and then highlight just an element of the next section.
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:21.160]   Let me read for us.
[00:01:21.160 --> 00:01:23.800]   It says, "You have heard that it was said.
[00:01:23.800 --> 00:01:26.640]   An eye for an eye and a tooth for tooth.
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:29.920]   But I say to you, do not resist an evil person.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:34.160]   But whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn the other to him also.
[00:01:34.160 --> 00:01:39.080]   If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
[00:01:39.080 --> 00:01:43.080]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him too.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:48.500]   Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you.
[00:01:48.500 --> 00:01:52.360]   You have heard that it was said, you shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.320]   But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may
[00:01:57.320 --> 00:02:00.320]   be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
[00:02:00.320 --> 00:02:04.880]   For he causes his son to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous
[00:02:04.880 --> 00:02:06.520]   and the unrighteous.
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.560]   For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[00:02:10.560 --> 00:02:13.480]   Do not even the task collectors do the same?
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.600]   If you greet only your brothers, what more are you doing than others?
[00:02:17.600 --> 00:02:20.080]   Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:23.720]   For you are to be perfect, as your heavenly Father is perfect.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:25.840]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:33.200]   Our God, we really do ask for your spirit to move through your word and convict our
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:34.200]   hearts.
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:38.360]   We recognize, Lord, that your truth is so powerful.
[00:02:38.360 --> 00:02:42.080]   And God, oftentimes your truth also is repetitive in your word.
[00:02:42.080 --> 00:02:45.560]   But sometimes, God, we are hard of hearing.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:47.160]   Sometimes we're forgetful.
[00:02:47.160 --> 00:02:50.000]   And sometimes, Lord, our hearts resist your word.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.400]   But I pray that, God, you would soften us, you would teach us, Lord, and we would humbly
[00:02:54.400 --> 00:02:55.400]   receive.
[00:02:55.400 --> 00:02:56.400]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:02:56.400 --> 00:02:57.400]   Amen.
[00:02:57.400 --> 00:03:04.080]   As we take a look at this passage, the context of Matthew chapter 5, if you take a look,
[00:03:04.080 --> 00:03:08.800]   just kind of skim with me for a brief second to just get the context here.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.160]   You know, this is that famous Sermon on the Mount in chapter 5.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.960]   And then in chapter 5, verses 1 through 12, you have the section that is famously known
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:18.960]   as the Beatitudes, right?
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:22.680]   So if you look at your Bibles, you'll have this long list of blessed are those, blessed
[00:03:22.680 --> 00:03:24.060]   are those.
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:30.360]   And what we see is Jesus teaching an incredible sermon, defining for us and telling us who
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.000]   is actually truly blessed, right?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.840]   Who is truly blessed of God.
[00:03:36.840 --> 00:03:39.600]   And it is so contrary to what is the norm.
[00:03:39.600 --> 00:03:41.760]   It is contrary to what we believe.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:46.800]   It's contrary to what is societal expectations and standards.
[00:03:46.800 --> 00:03:51.040]   Because society believes those are truly blessed who are educated.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.320]   Those are truly blessed who have skill.
[00:03:54.320 --> 00:03:58.600]   Those are truly blessed who are rich and have resources in their lives.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:02.600]   Here Jesus is telling them, no, blessed are those who are able to mourn over sin.
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:06.080]   Blessed are those who are poor in spirit and blessed are those who are able to make peace,
[00:04:06.080 --> 00:04:07.740]   and so on, right?
[00:04:07.740 --> 00:04:14.080]   So what we have, as I'm emphasizing, is a massive contrast between what people are perceiving
[00:04:14.080 --> 00:04:16.760]   versus what the reality is.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:18.520]   And he continues to do that.
[00:04:18.520 --> 00:04:24.120]   If you take a look, verses 13 and down, he talks about how the disciples should be salt
[00:04:24.120 --> 00:04:26.320]   and light of the earth.
[00:04:26.320 --> 00:04:31.640]   He is giving an expectation that is breaking what is normative.
[00:04:31.640 --> 00:04:35.120]   And I'm repeating that because he's going to continue to do that through the entire
[00:04:35.120 --> 00:04:36.280]   chapter.
[00:04:36.280 --> 00:04:42.280]   The normative way we sometimes think about life, and sometimes, again, in good intention,
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:47.240]   when non-Christians try to teach us, they tell you, "Don't be strange.
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:52.400]   Don't be weird, because that ruins your chances of excelling in life.
[00:04:52.400 --> 00:04:57.120]   As a matter of fact, if you had it your way, the best thing to do is work the system, be
[00:04:57.120 --> 00:05:00.960]   a leader, and come out on top in this world."
[00:05:00.960 --> 00:05:03.760]   God says, "No, you're to be radically different.
[00:05:03.760 --> 00:05:04.760]   You're to be salty.
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:10.680]   You're supposed to shine as so different from what is normative in this life."
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:16.320]   And so likewise, continuing on that theme of compare and contrast, Christ highlights
[00:05:16.320 --> 00:05:17.320]   these things.
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:19.920]   "You thought you knew.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:24.160]   You thought you had the Old Testament law, and you thought you had an understanding,
[00:05:24.160 --> 00:05:26.760]   but let me tell you what is real.
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:28.700]   What is real godliness.
[00:05:28.700 --> 00:05:30.760]   What is true spirituality.
[00:05:30.760 --> 00:05:34.280]   What is actually in the nature of God."
[00:05:34.280 --> 00:05:40.960]   One example of that, the first one, he says in verse 21, Matthew 5, 21, he says, "You
[00:05:40.960 --> 00:05:45.120]   have heard that the ancients were told, 'You shall not commit murder, and whoever commits
[00:05:45.120 --> 00:05:47.440]   murder shall be liable to the court.'
[00:05:47.440 --> 00:05:52.240]   But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be guilty before the
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:53.240]   court.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:59.360]   And whoever says to his brother, 'You good-for-nothing,' shall be guilty before the supreme court.
[00:05:59.360 --> 00:06:06.440]   And whoever says, 'You fool,' shall be guilty enough to go into the fiery hell."
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:08.660]   Wow.
[00:06:08.660 --> 00:06:15.080]   If you think about it in contrast, on an external superficial level, if you just say, "On this
[00:06:15.080 --> 00:06:19.440]   boundary, do not murder," the vast majority of us will say, "Good, I'm done with that
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:23.120]   one because I am not killing anybody these days."
[00:06:23.120 --> 00:06:26.720]   But Christ says, "You think you knew what God was trying to get at.
[00:06:26.720 --> 00:06:29.120]   You think you knew what it meant to be righteous.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:34.160]   And those Pharisees, the religious looters, they think they're setting the bar.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:38.240]   Let me radically challenge the normative that you think is acceptable."
[00:06:38.240 --> 00:06:41.600]   And what he does is he points to the internal heart and says, "But you have anger in your
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:43.620]   heart.
[00:06:43.620 --> 00:06:47.160]   You have this arrogance in your heart.
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:51.220]   You have this viciousness in your heart where you're willing to call somebody good-for-nothing.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:52.220]   You fool."
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:57.200]   And I don't want to do a mini sermon in a sermon, but that alone is so convicting, right?
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.040]   How many times have we in recent days watched articles, heard the news, saw what people
[00:07:02.040 --> 00:07:07.080]   were doing, da-da-da-da-da, and you just felt this rage in your heart?
[00:07:07.080 --> 00:07:09.760]   Jesus is pointing that out, right?
[00:07:09.760 --> 00:07:11.960]   Jesus is highlighting all of that.
[00:07:11.960 --> 00:07:16.400]   And so what I like to say is the passage that we're coming to is this compare and contrast
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:18.440]   of you think you know.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:24.520]   Yes, you have the Old Testament, but maybe in terms of the normative that you thought
[00:07:24.520 --> 00:07:30.280]   was acceptable, let me teach you what God expects in terms of the internal heart.
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:34.440]   The transformation of the insides, both your perspective, your attitude, your desires,
[00:07:34.440 --> 00:07:40.000]   and all the stuff that's the working of your insides, God wants to radically transform
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:41.800]   to purify.
[00:07:41.800 --> 00:07:47.960]   And so my proposition and the main thrust of the sermon is going to be to transform
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:53.880]   a particular element, which is the heart of retaliation for the grace of God.
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:08:00.400]   To transform the heart of retaliation through the grace of God.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:08.560]   Just from the overview reading of the passage, you saw that Christ was tackling a heavy element,
[00:08:08.560 --> 00:08:13.960]   a specific area of sin in the life of the disciples.
[00:08:13.960 --> 00:08:20.120]   And what he says, I'm going to present this as a command, the first point I want to highlight
[00:08:20.120 --> 00:08:24.040]   is to correct what you thought you knew about the law.
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:26.320]   Correct what you thought you knew about the law.
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.720]   When you take a look at this passage, Matthew 5, verse 38, he says, "You have heard that
[00:08:30.720 --> 00:08:35.840]   it was said, 'An eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth.'"
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:39.480]   And what he's doing is he is highlighting and pinpointing something that is commonly
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:48.440]   rehearsed, reiterated, quoted within the community, and he tackles that as you think you understand,
[00:08:48.440 --> 00:08:50.400]   but let me tell you what's up.
[00:08:50.400 --> 00:08:56.760]   Now this specific verse, you recognize it is a direct quotation from the Old Testament.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:59.880]   It comes from Exodus chapter 21, verse 23 through 25.
[00:08:59.880 --> 00:09:04.000]   I'll read it for us and it says this, "But if there is any further injury, then you shall
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.960]   appoint as a penalty life for life, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, and hand for hand.
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:15.360]   Foot for foot, burn for burn, wound for wound, bruise for bruise."
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:20.200]   Now this law God gave to the people, essentially to govern the people.
[00:09:20.200 --> 00:09:25.160]   He gave to Moses as a civil law, not as necessarily how you're supposed to treat each other one
[00:09:25.160 --> 00:09:28.600]   to one, but as a civil law to govern the people.
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:34.600]   And in other cultures, other historical nations and governments, this law exists to this day,
[00:09:34.600 --> 00:09:35.600]   right?
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:38.080]   In Latin it's called lex talionis.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:43.040]   Essentially they quote eye for eye, and the thought there is when there is injury, the
[00:09:43.040 --> 00:09:46.920]   consequence and penalty should be of equal value, right?
[00:09:46.920 --> 00:09:49.320]   And essentially that's what exists.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:54.600]   But we have to ask this question, why did God give this law to the people?
[00:09:54.600 --> 00:09:58.560]   Well the first answer is very obvious and clear, it is because God himself is a fair
[00:09:58.560 --> 00:10:02.040]   God who is a God of law and order.
[00:10:02.040 --> 00:10:05.040]   God himself is a God of justice.
[00:10:05.040 --> 00:10:10.360]   God himself is a God where the punishment is of appropriateness.
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:15.280]   He is not a Greek God who is on a whim, who happens to react impulsively.
[00:10:15.280 --> 00:10:19.960]   And should you just catch him on a bad day, he ends up just eradicating everybody.
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:27.560]   Now someone might say, "But, but hasn't God in the Old Testament, hasn't he eradicated
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.360]   many people?
[00:10:29.360 --> 00:10:34.240]   Even immediately after Moses receives the law, didn't he split open the ground and cause
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:36.040]   people to die?"
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:39.880]   What I'm going to say is, every judgment in the Old Testament that you see, no matter
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:44.880]   how severe you think it is, was always appropriate.
[00:10:44.880 --> 00:10:52.040]   Because sin against the Holy God, sin against the Almighty, it is devastating.
[00:10:52.040 --> 00:10:56.800]   We even recognize degrees of punishment based on who we sin against.
[00:10:56.800 --> 00:11:00.840]   It is different when you sin against somebody who happens to be your friend, it is different
[00:11:00.840 --> 00:11:05.320]   if you transgress an American law against a president or a sitting official.
[00:11:05.320 --> 00:11:06.480]   There's difference of penalty.
[00:11:06.480 --> 00:11:11.360]   I'm just saying that to say, the reason why God gives this law that there should be equal
[00:11:11.360 --> 00:11:16.560]   and appropriate kind of punishment, even amongst person to person, is because God himself is
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:19.160]   always just and fair.
[00:11:19.160 --> 00:11:21.200]   That is his nature.
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:29.320]   Now I think what's more obvious is he gave this law because people needed it.
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:34.640]   There is such a propensity, there is such a habit in the heart of man.
[00:11:34.640 --> 00:11:39.920]   When you feel like you've been hurt, you've been dishonored, disrespected, you've been
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:45.360]   attacked, to just come out with this retaliation, "Oh really?
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:50.280]   You're going to feel the full force of my wrath!"
[00:11:50.280 --> 00:11:55.000]   Retaliation is so like a knee-jerk reaction in the sinful heart.
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.820]   What I'm going to say then is the scriptures teach us that this law was given to restrain
[00:12:00.820 --> 00:12:02.720]   our sin.
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:05.480]   Take a look at a passage in Deuteronomy chapter 19.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:09.040]   We recognize that this command was given in multiple contexts.
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.280]   It was given early on in the book of Exodus.
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:17.760]   It was also given later on in the second Deuteronomy, with the people in the wilderness.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:22.720]   Before they went into the land of Cana, after 40 years, they have reiteration of this law.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:29.680]   And what he says is in verse 18, this is Deuteronomy 19 verse 18, "The judges shall investigate
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:36.160]   thoroughly and if the witness is a false witness and he accused his brother falsely, then you
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:39.920]   shall do to him just as he has intended to do to his brother."
[00:12:39.920 --> 00:12:43.600]   And then look what he says, "Thus you shall purge the evil from among you."
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:47.880]   What God was desiring was to prevent more wickedness.
[00:12:47.880 --> 00:12:53.000]   God designed to govern the people that there would be a cap on this stacking up of hitting
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.360]   each other, hurting each other, and ultimately destroying each other.
[00:12:56.360 --> 00:12:59.160]   But you notice what is the bent of the human heart.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:04.280]   And I'm highlighting this because when there is a law given, it is not because God happened
[00:13:04.280 --> 00:13:08.200]   to be this exacting mean God of the Old Testament.
[00:13:08.200 --> 00:13:12.360]   There are people, Christians, who actually write that in commentaries, that God had this
[00:13:12.360 --> 00:13:14.340]   exacting nature to him.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.800]   God has this exacting nature even to this day.
[00:13:16.800 --> 00:13:22.560]   He says in the New Testament, "Not even a single careless word will go unpunished."
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.520]   What it is is actually God restraining more sin.
[00:13:26.520 --> 00:13:31.400]   And the problem is, God gives good laws and the people are so sinful that when they're
[00:13:31.400 --> 00:13:33.800]   hurt, they exaggerate.
[00:13:33.800 --> 00:13:35.660]   Why do you think there is this case?
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:38.440]   You know when a brother gives false testimony?
[00:13:38.440 --> 00:13:40.360]   You know what's false testimony?
[00:13:40.360 --> 00:13:43.360]   Someone hurts you and you're like, "That guy, he has it out for me.
[00:13:43.360 --> 00:13:44.580]   He wants to kill me.
[00:13:44.580 --> 00:13:46.600]   He wants to get rid of me.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.520]   I think he actually made a mistake."
[00:13:50.520 --> 00:13:55.800]   Exaggeration is a false testimony, and we do it all the time.
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:13:56.800]   Why?
[00:13:56.800 --> 00:13:59.760]   Because our hearts retaliate.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:06.040]   When we feel offended, we have this knee-jerk reaction to want to hurt back, to make sure,
[00:14:06.040 --> 00:14:09.200]   "Don't you dare ever do this to me!"
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:10.960]   And that's what we're talking about.
[00:14:10.960 --> 00:14:16.640]   But what I like to highlight is, in summary, God's law, even here in the Old Testament,
[00:14:16.640 --> 00:14:21.480]   both Exodus, Deuteronomy, it comes from his governing grace.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:22.480]   Amen?
[00:14:22.720 --> 00:14:27.440]   I want to highlight that because sometimes people have this weird false dichotomy.
[00:14:27.440 --> 00:14:33.040]   Anything that reeks of harsh judgment, consequences for sin, is like, "God is so OT," like Old
[00:14:33.040 --> 00:14:34.040]   Testament.
[00:14:34.040 --> 00:14:35.400]   No, no, no, no.
[00:14:35.400 --> 00:14:39.400]   This is God's mercy on the people to cap and restrain them.
[00:14:39.400 --> 00:14:40.900]   You need this.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:45.240]   And the law regularly shows us, "It's you!"
[00:14:45.240 --> 00:14:47.120]   That's what I'm talking about.
[00:14:47.120 --> 00:14:52.880]   But historically, then, when God gives good laws, how did people understand it?
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:54.360]   How did people take it?
[00:14:54.360 --> 00:14:58.480]   And this is where I want to find conviction, is because I realize this is in us.
[00:14:58.480 --> 00:14:59.840]   This is in me.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:05.200]   As I read this passage and asked the question, "Why does God give these laws, and how do
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:06.320]   people receive them?"
[00:15:06.320 --> 00:15:10.200]   And when Jesus says, "You have heard," he is not only highlighting the fact that it
[00:15:10.200 --> 00:15:15.040]   was written in the Old Testament, but he's highlighting your perception of it.
[00:15:15.040 --> 00:15:17.360]   This is your normative.
[00:15:17.360 --> 00:15:19.040]   This is what you think is acceptable.
[00:15:19.040 --> 00:15:22.840]   This is what you thought was the command of God.
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:24.520]   How did people take it?
[00:15:24.520 --> 00:15:31.320]   I think what's clear is people take it as though the law of God gave them a right.
[00:15:31.320 --> 00:15:33.600]   Let me explain what I mean by that.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:35.400]   The law of God says, "Eye for an eye."
[00:15:35.400 --> 00:15:40.000]   And he says, basically, "You shall not inflict excessive penalty."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:42.440]   It's in the American law, Eighth Amendment, right?
[00:15:42.440 --> 00:15:49.600]   "There will not be a cruel and unusual punishment, and you shall not induce a cruel, overreaching
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:53.520]   penalty, whether for parole or whatever it may be.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:54.520]   You shall not do that."
[00:15:54.520 --> 00:15:59.240]   But rather than thinking of it as a cap to restrain them, they thought of it as, "I
[00:15:59.240 --> 00:16:06.080]   have a right to make sure you know you never, ever treat me like that.
[00:16:06.080 --> 00:16:07.080]   I have a right.
[00:16:07.080 --> 00:16:09.880]   If you're going to treat me like that, then I get to treat you like that.
[00:16:09.880 --> 00:16:10.880]   Eye for an eye."
[00:16:10.880 --> 00:16:16.480]   It became a right and excuse to enact it.
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.920]   You see what I'm talking about there?
[00:16:18.920 --> 00:16:22.240]   And so in that way, I would like to move to my second point.
[00:16:22.240 --> 00:16:28.360]   In order to have this transforming of the inner heart of retaliation, we have to repent
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.360]   of that inner desire.
[00:16:31.360 --> 00:16:34.640]   And the way I'd like to make sense of it to you, I'm going to rephrase my second point,
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:38.880]   is repent of the little gangster in your heart.
[00:16:38.880 --> 00:16:41.040]   We all have the little gangster in our heart.
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:42.040]   Some of you guys know my background.
[00:16:42.040 --> 00:16:45.400]   When I was in high school, I thought it was so cool to be in a gang, and so I joined the
[00:16:45.400 --> 00:16:46.400]   gang.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:49.600]   And we thought we were so tough, and we thought we were so hard, and all the guys, they had
[00:16:49.600 --> 00:16:50.600]   this mentality.
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.640]   It's like, "If you even look at me, you're going to get it."
[00:16:54.640 --> 00:16:56.440]   Come on, we all have that little gangster voice.
[00:16:56.440 --> 00:16:57.680]   It even has a little accent.
[00:16:57.680 --> 00:16:59.720]   It's like, "No, dog."
[00:16:59.720 --> 00:17:01.560]   And some of you even snap your fingers.
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   You have the thing you do with your head when you bob and you're mad inside.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.200]   And some of you guys, laughing hard, that's not really an internal thing.
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.120]   It comes out outside too, right?
[00:17:12.120 --> 00:17:18.040]   You kind of change your voice when you get into this mode where you say, "No.
[00:17:18.040 --> 00:17:20.520]   If you hurt me, I'm going to hurt you back."
[00:17:20.520 --> 00:17:21.520]   Right?
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:24.080]   Where your heart says, "You hurt me?
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:26.360]   It's my turn."
[00:17:26.360 --> 00:17:28.560]   That exists, and we recognize it.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:29.560]   And I want to say this.
[00:17:29.560 --> 00:17:32.880]   There is a perversion of the logic of the law.
[00:17:32.880 --> 00:17:37.680]   There is a perversion where the law of "I for an I" was given as a consistent standard
[00:17:37.680 --> 00:17:42.880]   of God, and it is appropriate for us to uphold the consistent standard of God, versus you
[00:17:42.880 --> 00:17:45.280]   want to uphold you.
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:47.480]   You want to avenge you.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:53.920]   You want to make sure that you are the judge, jury, and executioner.
[00:17:53.920 --> 00:17:54.920]   You better respect me.
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:55.920]   You better recognize.
[00:17:55.920 --> 00:17:56.920]   Right?
[00:17:56.920 --> 00:18:01.400]   Like, the gangster comes out of you, and it speaks like that.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.080]   And that part of it needs to be repented of.
[00:18:04.080 --> 00:18:07.480]   There's a passage in Leviticus chapter 24.
[00:18:07.480 --> 00:18:09.120]   Turn in your Bibles there.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.640]   Leviticus chapter 24, verse 19.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.040]   It shows to us the rationale behind this law.
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:21.120]   And he says, "If a man injures his neighbor, just as he has done, so it shall be done to
[00:18:21.120 --> 00:18:22.120]   him.
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:27.120]   Fracture for fracture, eye for eye, tooth for tooth, just as he has injured a man, so
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.520]   it shall be inflicted on him.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:33.400]   Not just the one who kills an animal shall make it good, but the one who kills a man
[00:18:33.400 --> 00:18:35.520]   shall be put to death.
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:38.440]   There shall be one standard for you.
[00:18:38.440 --> 00:18:43.580]   It shall be for the stranger as well as the native, for I am the Lord your God."
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:49.360]   He wanted that standard because of his objective righteousness.
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:51.800]   And he's not a respecter of people.
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:56.000]   He doesn't have this, "da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da, this is on this day, that day."
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:59.960]   He wants an objective standard and we as Christians have to uphold it.
[00:18:59.960 --> 00:19:07.240]   What's false and erroneous is we twist that as a justification for my vengeance.
[00:19:07.240 --> 00:19:09.500]   To avenge me.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:13.680]   But who's gonna make sure he knows how much he hurt me?
[00:19:13.680 --> 00:19:17.500]   Who's gonna make sure that he actually respects me?
[00:19:17.500 --> 00:19:23.980]   And that is two entirely different things, but sometimes so, so muddy.
[00:19:23.980 --> 00:19:29.020]   Now as I want to give examples of this, there's a clear example of retaliation in Scripture.
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.420]   Turn your Bibles to Genesis chapter 4.
[00:19:31.420 --> 00:19:36.700]   So early on in the history of man, there was a sinfulness already ingrained into his heart.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:44.140]   Genesis chapter 4 verse 23, it says this, "Lamech said to his wives, 'Ada and Zillah,
[00:19:44.140 --> 00:19:45.540]   listen to my voice.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:51.460]   You wives of Lamech, give heed to my speech, for I have killed a man for wounding me, a
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:53.380]   boy for striking me.
[00:19:53.380 --> 00:19:59.700]   If Cain is avenged sevenfold, then Lamech seventy-sevenfold.'"
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:05.420]   I presume if the secular world read this, they would think, "Oh man, that guy's gangster.
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.820]   You don't mess with him."
[00:20:08.820 --> 00:20:15.620]   The weird thing is, that heart, he's bragging about how in his arrogance, no one's gonna
[00:20:15.620 --> 00:20:17.900]   mess with him.
[00:20:17.900 --> 00:20:19.500]   He wants them to hear about it.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:23.420]   "You don't mess with me, because I'm a gangster."
[00:20:23.420 --> 00:20:26.140]   I don't want to overdo it, but that part's in there.
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:28.860]   And let me give you an example of case scenarios.
[00:20:28.860 --> 00:20:30.340]   It comes up in everywhere.
[00:20:30.340 --> 00:20:35.500]   On the court, I confess to you, there have been times, you play basketball, some guy
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:38.620]   does a dirty move, and all of a sudden, your gangster voice comes out, and you're like,
[00:20:38.620 --> 00:20:40.220]   "Oh, we're gonna play like that, huh?"
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:43.020]   You're gonna play dirty?
[00:20:43.020 --> 00:20:46.820]   And you almost want to retaliate, like, "Now it's my turn."
[00:20:46.820 --> 00:20:49.300]   In the car, someone cuts you off?
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:53.540]   I mean, road rage is like a classic example of retaliation.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:55.580]   You want to make sure, it's like, "Oh, you want to know how it feels?
[00:20:55.580 --> 00:20:57.580]   You drive all fast, go in front of the person?"
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:00.140]   Of course, I've never done that.
[00:21:00.140 --> 00:21:02.460]   But in the car, do you ever start screaming?
[00:21:02.460 --> 00:21:05.060]   "You need to get off the road!
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:08.460]   You don't deserve to drive!"
[00:21:08.460 --> 00:21:09.460]   Does it happen in marriages?
[00:21:09.460 --> 00:21:14.460]   It's like, "Oh, you can talk to me like that, with no restraint?
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:17.300]   You want to know how angry I can be?
[00:21:17.300 --> 00:21:19.620]   You want to see me mad?"
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:23.180]   It happens in marriages, relationships.
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:25.860]   It happens in so many different scenarios.
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:29.460]   And that all to say, again, it's sometimes so deceptive, the heart is deceptive.
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:34.420]   We think that doing that is the right thing to do.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:41.420]   We think doing that is actually the right way to make sure the sin is dealt out with.
[00:21:41.420 --> 00:21:42.780]   No.
[00:21:42.780 --> 00:21:49.300]   This passage is so convicting because it tackles, again, your preconceived notion of what is
[00:21:49.300 --> 00:21:51.460]   normative for the righteous person.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:54.020]   Yeah, "I" for an "I."
[00:21:54.020 --> 00:21:58.660]   And what Jesus does is point very directly into the heart and says, "Your insides, that
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:21:59.660]   needs to be transformed."
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:07.820]   So, I move now to point number three, where Jesus commands.
[00:22:07.820 --> 00:22:09.660]   Jesus instructs.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:15.300]   And as a summary of what He instructs us to do, He instructs us to give even more and
[00:22:15.300 --> 00:22:16.300]   more.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:17.300]   Excuse me.
[00:22:17.300 --> 00:22:18.300]   Hold on.
[00:22:18.300 --> 00:22:23.980]   He instructs us to give even more and more.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:27.380]   Let's take a look at the passage once more, right?
[00:22:27.380 --> 00:22:30.260]   He says, after saying, "You have heard."
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:36.100]   Verse 39, "Do not resist an evil person, but whoever slaps you on your cheek, turn
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:37.780]   the other to him also.
[00:22:37.780 --> 00:22:43.700]   If anyone wants to sue you and take your shirt, let him have your coat also.
[00:22:43.700 --> 00:22:47.940]   Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him too.
[00:22:47.940 --> 00:22:52.900]   Give to him who asks of you, and do not turn away from him who wants to borrow from you."
[00:22:52.900 --> 00:22:54.540]   Wow.
[00:22:54.540 --> 00:22:58.140]   If you take a moment to not read that as just like, "Yeah, these are just lofty things
[00:22:58.140 --> 00:22:59.540]   Jesus says," right?
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.860]   Would you meditate on that?
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:04.500]   It should cause you to be like, "Wait, wait, what?
[00:23:04.500 --> 00:23:10.540]   Did you say the evil person?"
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:14.620]   You know what makes it so hard sometimes to hold your tongue is when you see wickedness,
[00:23:14.620 --> 00:23:15.860]   right?
[00:23:15.860 --> 00:23:20.900]   And then part of you, like, I'm almost like trying to share with you my personal reaction
[00:23:20.900 --> 00:23:22.900]   when I was working through this passage in my devotions.
[00:23:22.900 --> 00:23:24.580]   Like, I had weird reactions.
[00:23:24.580 --> 00:23:27.900]   Initially, I was like, "Oh yeah, you just got to read the context because there's got
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:28.900]   to be more than that."
[00:23:28.900 --> 00:23:31.580]   Like, he's got to be qualified.
[00:23:31.580 --> 00:23:33.980]   There's got to be some caveats here, right?
[00:23:33.980 --> 00:23:37.100]   And then you read him say like, "Even to the evil person."
[00:23:37.100 --> 00:23:40.940]   And then you start thinking of the other passages like, "No, Scripture says expose them.
[00:23:40.940 --> 00:23:42.900]   Scripture says to not walk with them."
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.940]   Well, clearly, yes, Jesus is not telling you to condone the evil man.
[00:23:47.940 --> 00:23:55.700]   But what he's telling you is to not resist with retaliation and what's more, to give
[00:23:55.700 --> 00:23:58.860]   generously.
[00:23:58.860 --> 00:24:03.460]   And part of me just reacted with like a, "This can't be."
[00:24:03.460 --> 00:24:05.820]   I'm not sure if ever you guys have had that moment.
[00:24:05.820 --> 00:24:10.820]   You're reading the Scriptures and you're like, "Huh, it doesn't make sense."
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:13.860]   Of course, we're going to stand against the evil person.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:16.180]   Of course, I'm going to defend myself.
[00:24:16.180 --> 00:24:21.060]   Of course, if he falsely accuses me, I'm going to give a defense.
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.980]   And again, I want to challenge you.
[00:24:22.980 --> 00:24:28.900]   Jesus is going to regularly ask us, "Are you going to do exactly what everybody else does?
[00:24:28.900 --> 00:24:30.380]   How then are you any different?
[00:24:30.380 --> 00:24:32.780]   You're going to say the exact same thing?
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:36.140]   You're going to do the exact same thing?
[00:24:36.140 --> 00:24:38.820]   How much do you have to give?"
[00:24:38.820 --> 00:24:43.940]   And so I want to walk through this a little bit because he says, "If you are slapped and
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.420]   someone slaps you on your..."
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:49.860]   It's interesting, right, that he actually specifies on the right side of your cheek,
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:50.860]   right?
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:55.900]   But I want you to think about that because you know, I mean, even when me and my brother,
[00:24:55.900 --> 00:24:58.980]   when we were young and we were fighting, we just knew, "You don't touch the face."
[00:24:58.980 --> 00:25:00.860]   We could punch each other all we want.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:01.860]   We could wrestle.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.220]   We could do all kinds of crazy stuff, but you don't touch the face.
[00:25:04.220 --> 00:25:05.220]   Why?
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:08.060]   Because absolutely disrespectful.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:13.700]   And what Jesus is doing is he's highlighting one of the elements that to us is so difficult
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:20.220]   to just hold our tongue, to just not retaliate, is in the moment of disrespect.
[00:25:20.220 --> 00:25:23.980]   And there's part of it that's going to be like, "Don't we have a right to that?
[00:25:23.980 --> 00:25:26.420]   Don't we have a right to dignity?
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   Don't we have a right?
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:29.540]   I should be respected.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:31.660]   If you're a father, I should be respected in this home.
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:35.300]   If you're a boss, I should be respected in this job."
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:37.780]   We feel like we have that right.
[00:25:37.780 --> 00:25:38.900]   There's more.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:43.980]   He says, "If someone wants to sue you and take your shirt," it's also very interesting
[00:25:43.980 --> 00:25:48.300]   that he describes the difference between taking your shirt and then taking your cloak.
[00:25:48.300 --> 00:25:53.180]   And you guys have heard probably that this idea of the cloak, a lot of people at that
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:55.620]   time, they just had one.
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:56.980]   That's all they had.
[00:25:56.980 --> 00:26:02.540]   So to a worker, Jesus says, "If you have one of his possessions as some kind of collateral,
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:04.580]   make sure you give it back to him by the end of the day."
[00:26:04.580 --> 00:26:05.580]   Why?
[00:26:05.580 --> 00:26:07.260]   Because he has nothing else.
[00:26:07.260 --> 00:26:10.540]   And then he says, "Give it to him."
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:11.540]   What?
[00:26:11.540 --> 00:26:18.100]   Our natural tendency, if you're sued and accused, you're going to have this tendency to be like,
[00:26:18.100 --> 00:26:19.100]   "What?
[00:26:19.100 --> 00:26:21.420]   I have a right to be defended against stuff like that.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.260]   I have a right to not be falsely accused of stuff."
[00:26:24.260 --> 00:26:25.260]   Yes?
[00:26:25.260 --> 00:26:30.740]   And it would be to you this feeling of right to protections and security.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:36.300]   And then he goes on and says, "Whoever forces you to go one mile, go with him two."
[00:26:36.300 --> 00:26:38.380]   It's like, "What?
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.740]   Mind-blowing stuff."
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:41.460]   Back then there were Roman soldiers.
[00:26:41.460 --> 00:26:46.020]   Legally, Roman soldiers could grab all the material, give it to a civilian, say, "I'm
[00:26:46.020 --> 00:26:47.860]   going to take my stuff and walk."
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   Right?
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:50.380]   "Carry the burden, you donkey."
[00:26:50.380 --> 00:26:52.100]   Like that's pretty much what it was.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   And so you can imagine the civilians, they hated Roman soldiers.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.460]   It's like, "Oh my goodness, these people."
[00:26:58.460 --> 00:26:59.460]   Right?
[00:26:59.460 --> 00:27:02.460]   "Making me carry all their junk."
[00:27:02.460 --> 00:27:05.420]   He says to them, "Go with him the extra mile."
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:06.980]   That's what we get with proverbial statements.
[00:27:06.980 --> 00:27:08.300]   "Go the extra mile."
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.300]   Right?
[00:27:09.300 --> 00:27:14.540]   Question, how much do you have to give in you?
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:22.020]   Because what Jesus is doing is highlighting for the kingdom citizen, for the sons of God,
[00:27:22.020 --> 00:27:27.140]   sons and daughters, you should have through your relationship with God this wealth.
[00:27:27.140 --> 00:27:32.460]   That yes, even in the midst of persecution, even in the midst of suffering, we many times
[00:27:32.460 --> 00:27:35.420]   we find ourselves, we're the ones in need.
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:36.820]   I'm in suffering.
[00:27:36.820 --> 00:27:39.980]   I need help, but you're taking from me?
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:46.060]   Jesus is going to call out and say, "Even in those moments, through the gospel, through
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:50.740]   Christ and the completeness that we have in him, how much do you have to give?"
[00:27:50.740 --> 00:27:57.740]   And lastly, he says, "If someone asks you, do not turn him away."
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:02.500]   You know, some of the most annoying things in life are people who are prideful and people
[00:28:02.500 --> 00:28:04.780]   who are free birds.
[00:28:04.780 --> 00:28:08.060]   If you've ever had that guy in your life, the friend in your life who is just always
[00:28:08.060 --> 00:28:09.340]   like, "Can you spot me here?
[00:28:09.340 --> 00:28:10.340]   Can you spot me there?"
[00:28:10.340 --> 00:28:11.340]   It's like, "Wait a minute.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:12.340]   You have all this stuff.
[00:28:12.340 --> 00:28:15.860]   Why are you asking me for stuff when you have it?"
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:21.100]   Now, I am not saying that no matter what the circumstances are, just give.
[00:28:21.100 --> 00:28:22.860]   Just give, give, give, give, give.
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:24.860]   Because that is not true.
[00:28:24.860 --> 00:28:28.180]   But clearly, we understand Jesus' command here.
[00:28:28.180 --> 00:28:32.980]   He is telling us that, yes, you may have your right, but if you are going to say, "I have
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:37.780]   this right, and therefore I'm going to exercise my right, and never, ever will you take advantage
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:39.900]   of me."
[00:28:39.900 --> 00:28:41.140]   He's asking you.
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.700]   It sounds to me like then all you have is your life in this world.
[00:28:45.700 --> 00:28:48.740]   Don't you have more to give as a Christian?
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:51.820]   As a kingdom citizen, don't you have more to give?
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:55.020]   Take a look at Apostle Paul's attitude and mentality here.
[00:28:55.020 --> 00:28:56.220]   First Corinthians chapter 9.
[00:28:56.220 --> 00:28:58.260]   Please turn in your Bibles there.
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:01.140]   First Corinthians chapter 9.
[00:29:01.140 --> 00:29:03.460]   And he asked these questions.
[00:29:03.460 --> 00:29:06.340]   He says, "Am I not free?
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.620]   Am I not an apostle?
[00:29:08.620 --> 00:29:10.580]   Have I not seen Jesus our Lord?
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.960]   Are you not my work in the Lord?
[00:29:12.960 --> 00:29:17.380]   If to others I am not an apostle, at least I am to you.
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:21.140]   For you are the seal of my apostleship in the Lord.
[00:29:21.140 --> 00:29:23.760]   My defense to those who examine me is this.
[00:29:23.760 --> 00:29:26.500]   Do we not have a right to eat and drink?
[00:29:26.500 --> 00:29:31.500]   Do we not have a right to take along a believing wife, even as the rest of the apostles and
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:34.160]   the brothers of the Lord and Cephas?
[00:29:34.160 --> 00:29:38.140]   Or do only Barnabas and I not have the right to refrain from working?
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:41.740]   Who at any time serves as a soldier at his own expense?"
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:44.700]   See what he's talking about there?
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:48.940]   Turn in your eyes to verse 12, and he says, "If others share the right over you, do we
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:49.940]   not more?
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:55.980]   Nevertheless, we did not use this right, but we endure all things so that we will cause
[00:29:55.980 --> 00:29:59.140]   no hindrance to the gospel of Christ."
[00:29:59.140 --> 00:30:00.140]   Yeah.
[00:30:00.140 --> 00:30:03.540]   You know what's normal?
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:05.340]   I got a right to be here.
[00:30:05.340 --> 00:30:07.260]   I got a right for you to respect me.
[00:30:07.260 --> 00:30:10.700]   I've got a right for protections.
[00:30:10.700 --> 00:30:13.220]   Eye for an eye.
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:19.480]   And Jesus is going to say, "As a kingdom citizen, we regularly lay down our rights.
[00:30:19.480 --> 00:30:23.280]   We regularly hold our tongue, even in the midst of persecution.
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:28.380]   And we know Jesus Christ set this model for us to follow."
[00:30:28.380 --> 00:30:33.220]   Turn in your Bible to 1 Peter chapter 2, verse 21 through 24.
[00:30:33.220 --> 00:30:36.580]   Such an important passage for this topic.
[00:30:36.580 --> 00:30:43.780]   He says this, "For you have been called for this purpose, since Christ also suffered for
[00:30:43.780 --> 00:30:47.300]   you, leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps.
[00:30:47.300 --> 00:30:50.860]   Who committed no sin, nor was any deceit found in his mouth.
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:53.260]   And while being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:30:53.260 --> 00:30:58.340]   While suffering, he uttered no threats, but kept entrusting himself to him who judges
[00:30:58.340 --> 00:30:59.340]   righteously.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:04.860]   And he himself bore our sins in his body on the cross, so that we might die to sin and
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:06.340]   live to righteousness.
[00:31:06.340 --> 00:31:10.780]   For by his wounds you have been healed."
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:15.060]   The rationale and logic of the world, it makes sense to retaliate.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:19.740]   The rationale and logic of the gospel says, "You must have already died to this world,
[00:31:19.740 --> 00:31:25.940]   died to yourself, and you must be rich in the spiritual blessings of Christ."
[00:31:25.940 --> 00:31:36.820]   To be able to be reviled, to be stretched and whipped, and yet not revile in return.
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:40.000]   Now I would like to say this, moving to point number four.
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:45.020]   We recognize that Jesus is commanding us to give, give, and give, just like he has modeled,
[00:31:45.020 --> 00:31:46.580]   just as he has shown us.
[00:31:46.580 --> 00:31:52.500]   But I want to make sure that we understand that we have to, in this way, uphold the righteousness
[00:31:52.500 --> 00:31:55.020]   of God.
[00:31:55.020 --> 00:31:57.340]   Because some people misinterpreted this passage.
[00:31:57.340 --> 00:31:59.340]   Some people have this misunderstanding.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:08.380]   To be eye for an eye, to be tooth for tooth, is all Old Testament exacting punishment stuff.
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:13.420]   But to be a New Testament believer, gracious, you don't do this.
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:17.740]   And some people actually use this ideology to say we should be pacifists.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:20.260]   Some people use this ideology and they get kind of scared.
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.540]   Somebody commits a sin and you're like, "Well, what do we do?
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:23.540]   We just got to forgive."
[00:32:23.540 --> 00:32:26.140]   No, no, no.
[00:32:26.140 --> 00:32:29.460]   We uphold the righteousness of God.
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:38.300]   You see, what we understood was that God gave the Old Testament to purge sin.
[00:32:38.300 --> 00:32:42.020]   But what's happening is, in our sinfulness, we just stack sin for sin.
[00:32:42.020 --> 00:32:43.700]   So what does Scripture say?
[00:32:43.700 --> 00:32:47.980]   Regularly, you commit evil in the face of evil.
[00:32:47.980 --> 00:32:49.620]   Sin breeds more sin.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:55.140]   Their evil now inspires your evil and all you're doing is saying, "My turn for evil."
[00:32:55.140 --> 00:33:00.140]   And what God is saying to us is, "Do not repay evil for evil."
[00:33:00.140 --> 00:33:07.860]   But rather, accomplish the righteousness of God by giving good, by giving grace, by giving
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.860]   love.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:11.740]   You see, we're not trying to mimic this passage.
[00:33:11.740 --> 00:33:15.100]   Some people are like, "Oh yeah, maybe this is kind of in line with the stuff of Gandhi.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:18.460]   This is in line with the stuff of the passive resistance stuff."
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:19.460]   No, it is not.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:22.380]   This is very, very different.
[00:33:22.380 --> 00:33:27.060]   We absolutely uphold the justice and standard of God because every institution has been
[00:33:27.060 --> 00:33:29.340]   given by God to do so.
[00:33:29.340 --> 00:33:34.980]   Governments, churches, families, parents, all of these institutions have been given
[00:33:34.980 --> 00:33:39.660]   a stewardship of authority and they must enact justice.
[00:33:39.660 --> 00:33:44.820]   And consequences must be given for breaking of the law.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:51.520]   However, for us on a personal level, what we are doing is accomplishing the righteousness
[00:33:51.520 --> 00:33:54.620]   of God by our character in this.
[00:33:54.620 --> 00:34:00.340]   So turn your Bibles over to Romans chapter 12, verse 16 through 21, and look at what
[00:34:00.340 --> 00:34:01.340]   he says.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:05.540]   He says, "Be of the same mind toward one another.
[00:34:05.540 --> 00:34:08.700]   Do not be haughty in mind, but associate with the lowly.
[00:34:08.700 --> 00:34:12.060]   Do not be wise in your own estimation.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:15.020]   Never pay back evil for evil to anyone."
[00:34:15.020 --> 00:34:18.260]   And then he says this, "Respect what is right in the sight of all men."
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:19.260]   See?
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:23.340]   But what's more, it says, "If possible, so far it depends on you, be at peace with
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:24.420]   all men.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:28.020]   Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God, for it is
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.340]   written, 'Vengeance is mine.
[00:34:30.340 --> 00:34:33.100]   I will repay,' says the Lord.
[00:34:33.100 --> 00:34:35.780]   But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[00:34:35.780 --> 00:34:40.660]   If he is thirsty, give him a drink, for in so doing you will keep burning coals on his
[00:34:40.660 --> 00:34:41.660]   head.
[00:34:41.660 --> 00:34:47.860]   Do not be overcome by evil, but overcome evil with good."
[00:34:47.860 --> 00:34:53.100]   The challenge for us is to actually garner greater righteousness.
[00:34:53.100 --> 00:35:00.440]   Do not be so weak as to have your senses elicited that when evil is done for you, it becomes
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:01.440]   a temptation.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:02.440]   Me too.
[00:35:02.440 --> 00:35:05.220]   No, no, no, no, no.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:10.420]   For us, God is calling us to recognize in wisdom, every sin and transgression is going
[00:35:10.420 --> 00:35:13.860]   to be judged.
[00:35:13.860 --> 00:35:18.580]   Either already on the cross through the sacrifice of Christ, it will be judged thoroughly, or
[00:35:18.580 --> 00:35:23.760]   in hell, where God's wrath will be enacted, it will be judged thoroughly.
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:26.220]   You understand that.
[00:35:26.220 --> 00:35:30.660]   And so knowing that, you can have this kind of paradoxical understanding.
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:37.780]   "I uphold the righteousness of God, but I need not retaliate to vindicate myself.
[00:35:37.780 --> 00:35:41.100]   But rather I have this opportunity to give grace.
[00:35:41.100 --> 00:35:44.240]   Rather I have this opportunity to show love.
[00:35:44.240 --> 00:35:47.740]   Rather I have this opportunity to be like God."
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.340]   And so this is my next point.
[00:35:50.340 --> 00:35:55.940]   What the Lord is doing in this passage, yes, He is giving you parameters and He is doing
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:35:58.340]   this surgical number.
[00:35:58.340 --> 00:36:01.100]   "Oh, you think you have the right to protections?
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:02.900]   You think you have the right to respect?
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:03.900]   You!
[00:36:03.900 --> 00:36:05.780]   You think this is your norm?"
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.780]   And then He corrects all that stuff, right?
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:12.180]   But what He's also doing is He's giving these commands so that we would be.
[00:36:12.180 --> 00:36:13.840]   And so this is what He says.
[00:36:13.840 --> 00:36:18.940]   Take a look at Matthew chapter 5 now verse 43, and until the rest of that paragraph,
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.580]   verse 48.
[00:36:20.580 --> 00:36:24.620]   And He says, "You have heard that it was said, 'You shall love your neighbor and hate your
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:25.620]   enemy.'
[00:36:25.620 --> 00:36:30.180]   But I say to you, love your enemies and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may
[00:36:30.180 --> 00:36:32.880]   be sons of your Father who is in heaven.
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:37.980]   For He causes His Son to rise on the evil and the good, and sends rain on the righteous
[00:36:37.980 --> 00:36:39.360]   and the unrighteous.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:43.100]   For if you love those who love you, what reward do you have?
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:45.840]   Do not even tax collectors do the same?
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:49.880]   If you greet only your brothers, then what more are you doing than others?
[00:36:49.880 --> 00:36:52.580]   Do not even the Gentiles do the same?
[00:36:52.580 --> 00:36:57.860]   Therefore you are to be perfect, as your Heavenly Father is perfect."
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:37:03.820]   Brothers and sisters, earlier I said when I was reading this passage and kind of meditating,
[00:37:03.820 --> 00:37:05.500]   my reactions were varied.
[00:37:05.500 --> 00:37:08.420]   Initially it was like, "Whoa, these are extreme statements."
[00:37:08.420 --> 00:37:11.700]   And then there was this, "Well, there's got to be exceptions, you know?
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:12.980]   These aren't absolute statements."
[00:37:12.980 --> 00:37:15.060]   And that's true.
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:19.940]   Because this doesn't mean that everything wrong just be like, "Oh well, what can you
[00:37:19.940 --> 00:37:20.940]   do?"
[00:37:20.940 --> 00:37:22.340]   Like that is not what God is saying.
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:23.340]   At all.
[00:37:23.340 --> 00:37:24.340]   Right?
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:25.340]   People should obey laws.
[00:37:25.340 --> 00:37:26.900]   There should be justice.
[00:37:26.900 --> 00:37:28.380]   Okay?
[00:37:28.380 --> 00:37:34.260]   But my other reaction was, "I don't know how to apply this."
[00:37:34.260 --> 00:37:38.580]   Have you guys ever read the scriptures and just felt like that?
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.240]   You almost have this like, "Malfunction in my brain."
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:47.300]   And you want to ask God like, "Lord, I think you're going to need to give greater parameters,
[00:37:47.300 --> 00:37:48.740]   more instructions."
[00:37:48.740 --> 00:37:51.140]   And some of you guys are, your mind is geared like that.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:53.180]   It's like, "Wait a minute.
[00:37:53.180 --> 00:37:55.180]   Maybe you guys are like the engineers.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.660]   You need the written code."
[00:37:56.660 --> 00:37:59.700]   And you're like, "I just need to follow the lines.
[00:37:59.700 --> 00:38:01.380]   What am I supposed to do then?
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:04.100]   What if there's a guy who's just selfish and he's asking me stuff?
[00:38:04.100 --> 00:38:05.100]   Do I give now?
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:06.100]   Do I not give?
[00:38:06.100 --> 00:38:07.460]   What do you do?"
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:14.460]   And some of the stuff, yeah, when he even brings it up, it's not like, "Is that sin?
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:20.180]   If someone sues me because they think I did something wrong, do you see what I'm saying?"
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:22.900]   I almost have this like, "Malfunction in my head."
[00:38:22.900 --> 00:38:23.900]   I'm like, "Wait a minute.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:25.460]   You got to give me more.
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:29.780]   God, why are you not as clear as can be here, right?
[00:38:29.780 --> 00:38:32.780]   You got to give me more parameters."
[00:38:32.780 --> 00:38:34.660]   But I want to give you a challenge.
[00:38:34.660 --> 00:38:35.820]   And this is something I realized.
[00:38:35.820 --> 00:38:38.300]   This is just my immaturity.
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:44.260]   When God is giving us these commands, He is not trying to give you the minutia so that
[00:38:44.260 --> 00:38:50.620]   all you have to do is do a logical mind flow, a logical standard operating procedure so
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.660]   that you can go, "Oh, if A then B, then I can go here."
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:57.580]   Do you understand what He says?
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:38:59.580]   Imitate your father.
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.460]   Be like him.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.900]   And for those of you guys who have had parents who are wise and godly, so when it was time
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:10.420]   to be compassionate for those who are weak, they were so meek and compassionate and they
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:14.380]   were humble in heart, but when it came down to make sure that they laid down the law and
[00:39:14.380 --> 00:39:18.420]   they were strict and they made sure that people knew, "You can't do this stuff underneath
[00:39:18.420 --> 00:39:21.660]   our house because that's sin."
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.260]   And you looked at them and you realized, "Oh my goodness, there's wisdom in that.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.140]   There's part of you that wishes there was a manual book for that."
[00:39:27.140 --> 00:39:33.180]   But more so what you're doing is you're trying to emulate your wise father.
[00:39:33.180 --> 00:39:36.900]   If you had that in your life, blessed, you're blessed.
[00:39:36.900 --> 00:39:42.060]   If you didn't have that in your life, you have the Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:42.060 --> 00:39:46.500]   So strong, He knew the heart of men.
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.860]   So strong that He would not back down.
[00:39:49.860 --> 00:39:52.060]   So strong He spoke with authority.
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:54.740]   So strong He silenced people.
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:00.340]   So strong He took a court of whips and chased the marketeers, the money makers from the
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:01.340]   temple.
[00:40:01.340 --> 00:40:04.340]   And yet so humble.
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:07.620]   Talk about dignity.
[00:40:07.620 --> 00:40:09.140]   Talk about slapping in the face.
[00:40:09.140 --> 00:40:16.020]   Have you ever thought about being spit on in the face when you are the Lord of the universe
[00:40:16.020 --> 00:40:17.980]   and not saying anything back?
[00:40:17.980 --> 00:40:24.100]   Think about being forced, being forced to carry a beam, being forced to be stretched
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:26.260]   out then whipped.
[00:40:26.260 --> 00:40:28.340]   People asking you, "Why don't you do this, Jesus?
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:29.980]   Why don't you throw yourself down?
[00:40:29.980 --> 00:40:30.980]   Why don't you do this, Jesus?
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:31.980]   Why don't you feed all of us?
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:32.980]   Why don't you do..."
[00:40:32.980 --> 00:40:36.100]   Have you thought about that?
[00:40:36.100 --> 00:40:42.420]   When Jesus is saying those things and the death to which, you recognize He's done all
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:44.300]   that.
[00:40:44.300 --> 00:40:47.300]   You have a wise example in your Lord.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:52.660]   But what's more, you have a wise example in your Father, our God in heaven, who is showing
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.340]   to us His incredible character where it's both, right?
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:01.740]   It's both absolute righteousness, absolute sinlessness.
[00:41:01.740 --> 00:41:06.740]   It is a fearful thing because God says, "I will judge everything, even the thoughts and
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:09.220]   intentions that you think nobody sees."
[00:41:09.220 --> 00:41:13.820]   And what He cares for is the insides, your internals, the actual content of your mind
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:16.540]   and your heart as it relates to godliness.
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:21.740]   And what He's saying is, "Be like Me.
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:24.040]   Be like Me."
[00:41:24.040 --> 00:41:27.420]   And then as I thought about that, there was a part of me as I was doing my devotion and
[00:41:27.420 --> 00:41:31.180]   I thought, "Oh man."
[00:41:31.180 --> 00:41:36.100]   I regularly underestimate how sinful I am.
[00:41:36.100 --> 00:41:37.580]   And I think my intentions are pretty good.
[00:41:37.580 --> 00:41:43.220]   I make mistakes, but I sorely underestimate how sinful I am.
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:48.180]   And when you see this and you walk down Matthew and he's talking about "blessed are the meek,
[00:41:48.180 --> 00:41:51.420]   poor, gentle," all this kind of stuff and he's like, "You should be salty," and he starts
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:56.540]   talking about, "You shouldn't be angry, you shouldn't lust," and like, "Fail, fail, fail,
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:41:58.120]   fail, fail," right?
[00:41:58.120 --> 00:42:02.800]   You could have this weird sentiment, like this half rebellious, half discouraged sentiment
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:07.240]   in your heart like, "I don't know if I can do that."
[00:42:07.240 --> 00:42:10.480]   Have you guys ever read scripture and felt like that?
[00:42:10.480 --> 00:42:12.840]   Or felt so discouraged?
[00:42:12.840 --> 00:42:19.000]   You almost don't want to look up and then you kind of want to say to God, "I'll try.
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.880]   I have tried."
[00:42:21.880 --> 00:42:27.080]   And I want to encourage you because you have heard it said, "Eye for an eye," and people
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:30.960]   could not keep that even, right?
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:37.840]   Historically, mankind has been so riddled with sin, even though you have heard it said,
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.440]   even the traditions of the old, they were not actually able to keep.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:47.720]   And so again, if you're looking at the law of Christ now given to his disciples, please
[00:42:47.720 --> 00:42:52.180]   don't be discouraged because I want to give to you something as an encouragement.
[00:42:52.180 --> 00:42:57.620]   Even the law of the Old Testament, "Eye for an eye," I believe came from a fatherly heart
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:00.900]   that desired to restrain the sinful children.
[00:43:00.900 --> 00:43:03.180]   It's kind of like a dad.
[00:43:03.180 --> 00:43:06.420]   He sees these two kids just at each other's throat like, "That's mine.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:07.820]   No, you took it.
[00:43:07.820 --> 00:43:08.820]   It's mine."
[00:43:08.820 --> 00:43:09.820]   Right?
[00:43:09.820 --> 00:43:11.460]   The dad jumps in and says, "Stop.
[00:43:11.460 --> 00:43:12.460]   You only get two minutes.
[00:43:12.460 --> 00:43:13.460]   You only get two minutes.
[00:43:13.460 --> 00:43:14.460]   That's the law.
[00:43:14.460 --> 00:43:15.460]   It's going to be fair."
[00:43:15.460 --> 00:43:16.460]   Right?
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:17.460]   That's not him just being annoyed.
[00:43:17.460 --> 00:43:20.740]   He's actually preventing them destroying each other.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:27.380]   But remember also, when you hear God saying, "Be like me," that is fatherly love and instruction
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:29.220]   for you.
[00:43:29.220 --> 00:43:35.420]   Because God said in his love for you, "I want to share my glory with you," which I realize
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:38.940]   he is also saying, "I'm sharing my character trait with you.
[00:43:38.940 --> 00:43:45.220]   I want you to be like me in my righteousness, in my love, the depth to which, yes, you don't
[00:43:45.220 --> 00:43:48.060]   fully understand now, but I'm showing you.
[00:43:48.060 --> 00:43:52.740]   I have enemies of which you were one, and I came for you.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:58.300]   And I fed you, loved you, even when you were rejecting me and spitting.
[00:43:58.300 --> 00:44:00.340]   I want you to be like me."
[00:44:00.340 --> 00:44:04.140]   That is not something for us to be like, "I just can't do that stuff."
[00:44:04.140 --> 00:44:05.140]   Right?
[00:44:05.140 --> 00:44:09.540]   "I can't abide by all your rules."
[00:44:09.540 --> 00:44:11.420]   Think about it another way.
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:18.780]   That's for us to be like, "Thank you, Lord, for being my heavenly Father and desiring
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:23.420]   and saying in your word, 'You shall be perfect.'"
[00:44:23.420 --> 00:44:24.860]   That's grace upon you.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.860]   Amen?
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.020]   That's love for you.
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.620]   That's fatherly instruction to you.
[00:44:29.620 --> 00:44:35.020]   So we don't be discouraged when we find these things, but rather we recognize we need this
[00:44:35.020 --> 00:44:36.700]   in this life.
[00:44:36.700 --> 00:44:41.500]   A lot of us have been saying we feel persecution knocking at the door for those living here
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.340]   comfortably in Orange County.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:48.700]   We are going to have people perhaps accuse us falsely.
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:52.860]   We're going to have people try to force us to do things we don't like.
[00:44:52.860 --> 00:44:57.460]   And if you're going to be like, "I'm an American, and I have rights!"
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.020]   You do, and that's also true.
[00:45:01.020 --> 00:45:08.380]   But God desires us to be even more, to have such a wealth where this country is not everything
[00:45:08.380 --> 00:45:10.060]   to us.
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:14.860]   And we have this fist, this tight-gripped fist, where we're like, "Don't you dare
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:17.420]   threaten the rights that I have!"
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:22.620]   But rather this heart overflowing with the love of Christ says, "I've got more to give."
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:23.620]   Why?
[00:45:23.620 --> 00:45:24.620]   That's just like my dad.
[00:45:24.620 --> 00:45:27.620]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:37.100]   Our God, we want to again thank you so much.
[00:45:37.100 --> 00:45:42.540]   We recognize, God, that by your word you're leading us, you're teaching us.
[00:45:42.540 --> 00:45:47.420]   And it is our prayer, God, that we would be humbled to recognize that there are many elements
[00:45:47.420 --> 00:45:51.200]   of this, Lord, in different facets of our lives.
[00:45:51.200 --> 00:45:52.720]   We do retaliate.
[00:45:52.720 --> 00:45:55.140]   And sometimes for us, it's even confusing.
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:46:00.740]   Are we trying to uphold the law of God, or are we just getting even?
[00:46:00.740 --> 00:46:03.940]   And I pray, God, that you give us discernment.
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:09.300]   Discernment, Lord, God, in our homes, in our workplaces, so that, Lord, we will shine your
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:17.020]   glory, so that, Father, God, people can see the power of our Father working in us.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:21.860]   And so I pray, Father, God, we humbly acknowledge none of the things you challenge us to do,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:26.860]   none of the things that you have commanded us to be, is capable in our power.
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:30.460]   So we ask of you, Lord, that you would aid us through your truth, and that you would
[00:46:30.460 --> 00:46:31.620]   guide us in your spirit.
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:33.180]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:46:33.180 --> 00:46:33.540]   Amen.
