[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.440]   Alright, if you could turn your Bibles with me to 1 Corinthians chapter 15, we're looking
[00:00:06.440 --> 00:00:08.240]   at verse 12 through 19.
[00:00:08.240 --> 00:00:12.320]   1 Corinthians chapter 15, verse 12 through 19.
[00:00:12.320 --> 00:00:19.640]   We're going to be looking at the whole chapter, but I want to just read this portion.
[00:00:19.640 --> 00:00:24.600]   Now if Christ is preached that He has been raised from the dead, how do some among you
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.340]   say that there is no resurrection of the dead?
[00:00:27.340 --> 00:00:30.840]   If there is no resurrection of the dead, not even Christ has been raised, and if Christ
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:33.820]   has not been raised, then our preaching is vain.
[00:00:33.820 --> 00:00:35.480]   Your faith also is vain.
[00:00:35.480 --> 00:00:40.880]   Moreover, we are even found to be false witnesses of God, because we testified against God that
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:45.240]   He raised Christ, whom He did not raise, if in fact the dead are not raised.
[00:00:45.240 --> 00:00:49.080]   For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised, and if Christ has not been
[00:00:49.080 --> 00:00:51.060]   raised, your faith is worthless.
[00:00:51.060 --> 00:00:52.560]   You are still in your sins.
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:56.040]   And those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:00:56.040 --> 00:01:02.920]   If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are of all men most to be pitied.
[00:01:02.920 --> 00:01:05.680]   Let's pray.
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:13.500]   Father God, we pray for your grace, we pray for the Holy Spirit's mighty work, not only
[00:01:13.500 --> 00:01:18.800]   in us, but all throughout the world, Lord God, as thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[00:01:18.800 --> 00:01:22.400]   millions of people who are gathered together this morning to celebrate the resurrection
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.860]   of Christ.
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:28.600]   I pray, Lord God, that the power of the resurrection will have its effect in our worship, in our
[00:01:28.600 --> 00:01:32.200]   fellowship, in the preaching, in the singing.
[00:01:32.200 --> 00:01:35.080]   All of it, Lord God, may bring glory to you.
[00:01:35.080 --> 00:01:37.480]   I pray for open hearts.
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.920]   I pray, Lord God, that you would open the minds of those who do not yet believe, that
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.640]   they may see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ this morning.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:49.600]   Lord, we ask that you would anoint this time.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:54.560]   May your sweet presence, Lord God, be made known in all that we do.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:02:01.440]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:02:01.440 --> 00:02:06.720]   Can somebody claim to be a Christian and yet do not believe the bodily resurrection of
[00:02:06.720 --> 00:02:08.200]   Jesus Christ?
[00:02:08.200 --> 00:02:12.040]   Again, rhetorical question.
[00:02:12.040 --> 00:02:18.760]   Can somebody genuinely be a Christian and yet do not believe the bodily resurrection
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:20.480]   of Jesus Christ?
[00:02:20.480 --> 00:02:28.280]   Now, for whatever the reason, there are some people in certain circles and in some liberal
[00:02:28.280 --> 00:02:35.960]   churches that argue that the bodily resurrection does not matter, that there is things to be
[00:02:35.960 --> 00:02:40.640]   salvaged whether you believe in the real resurrection of Jesus Christ or not.
[00:02:40.640 --> 00:02:45.840]   One of these people is Professor Korb, who teaches at the New York University, and this
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:48.600]   is what he says about the resurrection.
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.880]   The miracle of a bodily resurrection is something I rejected without moving away from its basic
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:55.240]   idea.
[00:02:55.240 --> 00:02:59.760]   What I mean is that we can reach the lowest points of our lives of going deep into a place
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:03.600]   that feels like death and then find our way out again.
[00:03:03.600 --> 00:03:06.720]   That's the story the resurrection now tells me.
[00:03:06.720 --> 00:03:11.880]   And at Easter, this is expressed in community and at its best through the compassion of
[00:03:11.880 --> 00:03:13.280]   others.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:17.640]   In other words, what he is saying is even if you do not believe in the bodily resurrection
[00:03:17.640 --> 00:03:24.840]   of Jesus Christ, to him, resurrection is the idea that if you fall into darkness, if bad
[00:03:24.840 --> 00:03:28.360]   things happen in life, that we have hope.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:34.340]   And the idea of coming out of darkness and making something of your life is what the
[00:03:34.340 --> 00:03:38.980]   resurrection means to him.
[00:03:38.980 --> 00:03:45.840]   Is the resurrection the center of Christian faith or it is not?
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:51.740]   Jesus himself said in Matthew chapter 16, 4, when they kept on asking, "You say you're
[00:03:51.740 --> 00:03:56.880]   the Messiah, people are saying you're the Messiah, give us proof," Jesus said, "An
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:00.880]   evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and a sign will not be given to it
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.640]   except the sign of Jonah," meaning the resurrection.
[00:04:04.640 --> 00:04:10.080]   He pointed to the resurrection as the central activity that was going to prove everything
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:11.920]   he said.
[00:04:11.920 --> 00:04:17.580]   Everything he said, everything he did, everything that he proclaimed that he came to do rises
[00:04:17.580 --> 00:04:22.080]   and falls on the bodily resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:24.440]   It's kind of like Jenga.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:29.360]   If you ever play Jenga, you know, you're taking the pieces out and there's that one piece.
[00:04:29.360 --> 00:04:33.040]   You touch that wrong, everything else is going to fall.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:37.120]   Well, the resurrection is the Christian Jenga.
[00:04:37.120 --> 00:04:41.880]   And if you mess with that, if you reject the bodily resurrection of Christ, everything
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:45.760]   that you and I do falls apart.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:51.520]   In fact, in 1 Corinthians 15, 3 to 8, Paul says, "For I delivered to you as of first
[00:04:51.520 --> 00:04:54.640]   importance what I received."
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:59.560]   Now when he says what is first important, he's talking about what is most important,
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:04.160]   that in all of his preaching, all of his sacrifices, everything that's been going on in the first
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.800]   century, Paul says, and he summarizes, "In the first importance, what I received, I will
[00:05:10.800 --> 00:05:16.560]   give to you," and he says, "that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures."
[00:05:16.560 --> 00:05:24.640]   And then he says that he was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.400]   Some will say, "Well, you can say that.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:32.400]   That's put in the Bible because these men who have been propagating this for 2,000 years,
[00:05:32.400 --> 00:05:37.240]   I mean, first century, these guys basically began to tell this story.
[00:05:37.240 --> 00:05:40.200]   Now how are we going to validate that?"
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:44.080]   Paul says in the previous passage that he appeared to the 12 disciples, his resurrection
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:49.960]   physically, and then he appeared to 500 men, and then he appeared to the other apostles,
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:52.040]   and then to Paul himself.
[00:05:52.040 --> 00:05:59.400]   Now if we take that just literally, that alone is about 500 and some people.
[00:05:59.400 --> 00:06:05.380]   But again, remember, they didn't count the number of people the way we count today.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:09.640]   We have somewhere in this room maybe around 300 to 350 people in the room.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:10.880]   That's including everybody, right?
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:14.320]   And that's typically how we would count people.
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.160]   At that time, when they counted, they only counted men, and I know that may not sound
[00:06:18.160 --> 00:06:22.160]   fair, but the women and children did not have voting rights.
[00:06:22.160 --> 00:06:25.400]   They didn't have rights at that time, so they only counted men.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:31.560]   So when they said in the Bible that they fed 5,000 people, they're referring to 5,000 men.
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.360]   So if you count the way we would normally count, it would be probably close to 10,000
[00:06:35.360 --> 00:06:36.940]   to 15,000 people.
[00:06:36.940 --> 00:06:43.700]   So here, when it says he showed himself to 500 men, now we don't know the exact number,
[00:06:43.700 --> 00:06:47.540]   but he could easily be 1,000 plus.
[00:06:47.540 --> 00:06:55.900]   At the minimum, it says that he showed himself to 500, possibly over 1,000 people as eyewitnesses
[00:06:55.900 --> 00:06:59.620]   of his bodily resurrection.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:03.140]   Some people just may dismiss that and say, "Well, they're all telling a lie.
[00:07:03.140 --> 00:07:07.500]   They're doing propaganda."
[00:07:07.500 --> 00:07:09.400]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:07:09.400 --> 00:07:13.820]   Why do people lie?
[00:07:13.820 --> 00:07:15.400]   Let me ask you a more personal question.
[00:07:15.400 --> 00:07:16.400]   Why do you lie?
[00:07:16.400 --> 00:07:19.700]   Some of you guys think, "Well, I never lie."
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:23.060]   That's a lie right there, right?
[00:07:23.060 --> 00:07:26.240]   Maybe you're not in the habit of lying.
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:27.240]   Maybe that's not what you do.
[00:07:27.240 --> 00:07:28.240]   Obviously, we're Christians.
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:29.240]   We try not to lie.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:30.240]   But why?
[00:07:30.240 --> 00:07:35.360]   Because we remember, when you did lie, why did you lie?
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.300]   You don't tell lies to make yourself look bad.
[00:07:39.300 --> 00:07:41.880]   You don't tell lies that's going to hurt you.
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:50.900]   Typically, we compromise, we stretch the truth or exaggerate or outright lie to protect yourself
[00:07:50.900 --> 00:07:56.440]   because of personal benefit, whether that may be taxes or whether that may be something
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:04.040]   that you say to your boss, but people lie and exaggerate to protect themselves.
[00:08:04.040 --> 00:08:10.480]   But every single one of these people who are eyewitnesses of Jesus Christ, they ended up,
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.780]   many of them, giving their lives telling this supposed lie.
[00:08:14.780 --> 00:08:18.440]   Many of these people came from very prominent families.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.520]   Apostle Paul himself may have been a senator of the nation of Israel.
[00:08:23.520 --> 00:08:28.220]   His disciple was the greatest scholar of that time, a Roman citizen.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:30.980]   He ends up getting his head beheaded.
[00:08:30.980 --> 00:08:35.360]   And everybody who was attached to Apostle Paul, helping in his ministry, basically ended
[00:08:35.360 --> 00:08:38.500]   their life in the same way.
[00:08:38.500 --> 00:08:43.320]   So what possible motivation would there have been for these hundreds, possibly thousands
[00:08:43.320 --> 00:08:49.680]   of people who were supposedly eyewitnesses and went to their grave telling this lie,
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:53.600]   forfeiting everything that they had before they met Christ?
[00:08:53.600 --> 00:09:00.880]   Now because of this, majority of New Testament scholars, Christian and non-Christians alike,
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:08.080]   do not deny that the early eyewitnesses actually think they saw something.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.080]   They don't deny that.
[00:09:09.080 --> 00:09:11.740]   They don't deny that these people were making it, because it doesn't make sense for thousands
[00:09:11.740 --> 00:09:16.720]   of people to give their life saying they saw the resurrected Christ.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:22.920]   So today, the percentages, three-fourths of New Testament scholars, this is Christian
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:28.320]   and non-Christians put together, three-fourths of New Testament scholars do not deny that
[00:09:28.320 --> 00:09:36.600]   the eyewitnesses, at the minimum, believe what they were saying.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:42.160]   But let me ask you this morning, if I could convince you that the resurrection didn't
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.720]   happen, without a shadow of a doubt, right?
[00:09:45.720 --> 00:09:49.360]   Maybe you come to Resurrection Sunday and the pastor tries to convince you that it did
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:50.360]   happen.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:53.200]   What if I could convince you it didn't happen?
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:55.540]   And you left this room saying, "Huh!
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:57.600]   It didn't happen!"
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.580]   How would that affect you?
[00:10:00.580 --> 00:10:06.160]   What would change in your life if I did such a great job this morning and convinced you
[00:10:06.160 --> 00:10:11.200]   that the resurrection did not happen?
[00:10:11.200 --> 00:10:21.440]   Some people may say, "Well, you know, it didn't happen, but at least I have good friends.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:24.160]   At least I had a community.
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:26.640]   At least I lived with a purpose.
[00:10:26.640 --> 00:10:27.880]   At least I had some adventure."
[00:10:27.880 --> 00:10:33.720]   You know, we live in a culture today where neighborhoods and communities just don't exist.
[00:10:33.720 --> 00:10:37.320]   Even at work, you work at your cubicle and you do your job and you may have some connection,
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:40.840]   but for the most part, community has broken down.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:42.000]   Families have broken down.
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   Communities have broken down.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:46.120]   And everybody lives in, you know, pretty much in isolation.
[00:10:46.120 --> 00:10:51.080]   You go to your home, how many of you are good friends with your neighbors?
[00:10:51.080 --> 00:10:54.400]   Everybody just drives into their, you know, into their garage and shut the door.
[00:10:54.400 --> 00:10:57.760]   And then you may make eye contact when you take your trash out every once in a while,
[00:10:57.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   but outside of that, neighborhoods don't exist.
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:05.280]   So at least we were at church.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:09.400]   We had a group of friends, you know, and when you have birthday parties, you have a lot
[00:11:09.400 --> 00:11:10.400]   of people come.
[00:11:10.400 --> 00:11:14.280]   If you weren't at church, you might have two or three friends, maybe, depending on who
[00:11:14.280 --> 00:11:15.280]   you are.
[00:11:15.280 --> 00:11:17.760]   But for the most part, this is where you have friendship.
[00:11:17.760 --> 00:11:19.680]   This is where you have community.
[00:11:19.680 --> 00:11:26.020]   If the resurrection did not happen, how would it affect your life?
[00:11:26.020 --> 00:11:29.440]   Is it just, "Well, at least I had this."
[00:11:29.440 --> 00:11:33.160]   Well, that's not what the Scripture says.
[00:11:33.160 --> 00:11:39.320]   Paul actually argues, if the resurrection didn't happen, he argues, there's three things
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:44.320]   that he says in this text that I want to go over today, and why the resurrection is the
[00:11:44.320 --> 00:11:48.040]   foundation upon which we build everything.
[00:11:48.040 --> 00:11:52.580]   First of all, Paul says, "If Jesus was not raised from the dead, our preaching and our
[00:11:52.580 --> 00:11:54.680]   faith is in vain."
[00:11:54.680 --> 00:11:57.480]   First Corinthians 15, 14, and 15.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:12:02.720]   "And if Christ has not been raised, then our preaching is in vain, and your faith is in
[00:12:02.720 --> 00:12:03.720]   vain."
[00:12:03.720 --> 00:12:07.960]   We are even found to be misrepresenting God because we testified about God that He raised
[00:12:07.960 --> 00:12:13.440]   Christ, whom He did not raise, if it is true that the dead are not raised.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:18.760]   The word "vain" basically means empty or hollow.
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:22.640]   Or in Ecclesiastes, it basically means meaningless.
[00:12:22.640 --> 00:12:25.440]   There's nothing to salvage.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:31.800]   A couple weeks ago, our family went to Korea, and my oldest son, Jeremy, he had his favorite
[00:12:31.800 --> 00:12:33.600]   word that he repeated over and over again.
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:36.680]   That word was "siregi."
[00:12:36.680 --> 00:12:39.600]   That word was repeated out of his mouth probably over a thousand times.
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   "Siregi."
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.800]   And "siregi" is a Korean word for trash, basically.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:44.800]   That's his favorite word.
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:46.920]   Zachary's favorite word was "jugulhae."
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:49.360]   That basically means you want to die.
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.520]   And so every opportunity they got, they used their Korean.
[00:12:52.520 --> 00:12:53.520]   "Oh, that's siregi.
[00:12:53.520 --> 00:12:54.520]   Jugulhae?"
[00:12:54.520 --> 00:12:55.520]   Right?
[00:12:55.520 --> 00:12:59.760]   But basically, "siregi" basically means it's trash.
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:02.000]   And that's what "vain" means.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:03.520]   There's nothing to salvage.
[00:13:03.520 --> 00:13:05.360]   It is complete trash.
[00:13:05.360 --> 00:13:11.400]   If Jesus was not raised from the dead, our faith, our preaching, our life is trash.
[00:13:11.400 --> 00:13:12.720]   There's nothing to salvage.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:15.440]   It's "siregi."
[00:13:15.440 --> 00:13:24.920]   If all it is, is a placebo, like this professor says, if all the resurrection, if all Christianity
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:32.280]   is simply a placebo to trick ourselves and hold on to it like a security blanket, he
[00:13:32.280 --> 00:13:34.080]   said, it is absolutely worthless.
[00:13:34.080 --> 00:13:37.120]   It is in vain.
[00:13:37.120 --> 00:13:42.000]   I remember when I was a youth pastor, every once in a while, I would have a parent who
[00:13:42.000 --> 00:13:44.360]   would be so angry with me.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:47.760]   And the reason why they would be angry was that they would drop off their kids.
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:50.240]   And these are, you know, many of them from unbelieving parents.
[00:13:50.240 --> 00:13:53.240]   And they would drop off their kids, and they would love it in the beginning.
[00:13:53.240 --> 00:13:56.880]   And the reason why they would love it is because they had free babysitting.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:01.440]   And I was a youth pastor, and we had a local church, and we had a nice basketball court
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.680]   outside.
[00:14:02.680 --> 00:14:06.360]   And so I was a full-time youth pastor, so I just hung around church all the time.
[00:14:06.360 --> 00:14:11.200]   You know, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday, Sunday, I just lived there.
[00:14:11.200 --> 00:14:14.560]   So a lot of the youth group kids would just come and hang out at the church.
[00:14:14.560 --> 00:14:17.240]   They would bring their backpack, and they would do their homework, and in between, they
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:19.280]   would go out and run and play basketball.
[00:14:19.280 --> 00:14:24.000]   So it was basically just free babysitting.
[00:14:24.000 --> 00:14:27.880]   And then the older people, older kids would pick up the younger kids, and if they got
[00:14:27.880 --> 00:14:29.560]   hungry, we would take them out to eat.
[00:14:29.560 --> 00:14:31.680]   And so parents loved it.
[00:14:31.680 --> 00:14:37.400]   So some of the kids who were getting into trouble, you know, they were at church.
[00:14:37.400 --> 00:14:39.040]   We're having prayer meetings.
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.040]   We're doing Bible studies.
[00:14:40.040 --> 00:14:44.600]   So the parents loved it, until some of the kids started getting serious.
[00:14:44.600 --> 00:14:48.760]   And some of them started talking about going into ministry, possibly going to missions.
[00:14:48.760 --> 00:14:52.560]   And all of a sudden, the parents started getting upset.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:57.040]   They loved it when they were getting good morals, but we didn't want you to get too
[00:14:57.040 --> 00:14:59.920]   serious.
[00:14:59.920 --> 00:15:02.800]   I never took that personally.
[00:15:02.800 --> 00:15:06.880]   Sometimes they would tell me to my face, or they would look at me and just walk away,
[00:15:06.880 --> 00:15:08.440]   and I knew they were angry.
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.560]   I had a parent, not during that time, but I had a parent get straight up and call me
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:16.960]   a liar, that people like me are the ones who are ruining society, teaching people lies.
[00:15:16.960 --> 00:15:18.800]   That never bothered me.
[00:15:18.800 --> 00:15:23.400]   The reason why it doesn't bother me is because I understand where they're coming from.
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:28.040]   If you do not believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, then yeah, I'm influencing
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:30.480]   them to ruin their life.
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:37.360]   I'm preaching a gospel that challenges them to pick up their cross, to see this world
[00:15:37.360 --> 00:15:41.560]   as rubbish, and to look forward to the next world.
[00:15:41.560 --> 00:15:46.880]   So the gospel that I'm preaching to an unbeliever is offensive.
[00:15:46.880 --> 00:15:52.520]   What I didn't understand is if a Christian sees their child, and all they see is when
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:57.560]   their child comes, "Oh, he's getting good morals, he's being protected, and good things
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:16:04.280]   are happening to them," then they either did not understand what it is that we preach,
[00:16:04.280 --> 00:16:07.800]   or the child was not a good witness at home.
[00:16:07.800 --> 00:16:15.480]   Paul says if the resurrection did not happen, he says it is completely rubbish.
[00:16:15.480 --> 00:16:20.280]   In fact, he says in verse 19, "If for this life only we have hoped in Christ, we are
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:23.600]   all people most to be pitied."
[00:16:23.600 --> 00:16:27.880]   In other words, there's nothing to be salvaged, it's complete "siregi."
[00:16:27.880 --> 00:16:30.960]   It's completely empty.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.600]   I had a friend back in high school.
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:36.560]   He was top of the class.
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:38.960]   He ended up going to Stanford.
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:41.760]   And then even at Stanford, he made the Dean's List.
[00:16:41.760 --> 00:16:46.360]   So at the end of his sophomore year, I mean, it's hard enough to just get in just to get
[00:16:46.360 --> 00:16:48.720]   by, but he was on the Dean's List.
[00:16:48.720 --> 00:16:52.240]   And so every once in a while, our friends would talk, and we'd talk about him and how
[00:16:52.240 --> 00:16:59.080]   great he's doing, and once that guy graduates from Stanford, I mean, he's made.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:03.800]   But then at the end of his sophomore year, we heard that he dropped out of school.
[00:17:03.800 --> 00:17:06.600]   And next thing we hear is that he went to missions.
[00:17:06.600 --> 00:17:12.840]   We forgot where he went, but he went to some strange place to become a full-time missionary.
[00:17:12.840 --> 00:17:17.000]   And I remember some of my non-Christian friends or people who are very nominal wondering,
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:19.760]   "What a waste."
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:23.800]   That guy could have come out of Stanford, and he just automatically, just the fact that
[00:17:23.800 --> 00:17:28.200]   he came out of Stanford, he could have gotten any job.
[00:17:28.200 --> 00:17:33.280]   And yet he forfeited all of that to spend the rest of his life living in an uncomfortable
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.960]   area preaching the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:17:36.960 --> 00:17:39.000]   What a fool.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.280]   If Christ was not resurrected from the dead, he's to be pitied.
[00:17:43.280 --> 00:17:45.160]   And that's exactly what Apostle Paul said.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:48.080]   He forfeited everything to preach this gospel.
[00:17:48.080 --> 00:17:52.680]   Do you know why the resurrection of Jesus Christ was at the center of the message in
[00:17:52.680 --> 00:17:53.680]   the early church?
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:56.800]   Think about for a while.
[00:17:56.800 --> 00:18:00.360]   You can give a theological answer, because theologically, you know, it means this and
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:01.360]   that.
[00:18:01.360 --> 00:18:06.280]   Do you know why in the preaching of the early church, why the resurrection was central and
[00:18:06.280 --> 00:18:10.600]   first and foremost?
[00:18:10.600 --> 00:18:13.440]   Because it happened.
[00:18:13.440 --> 00:18:17.280]   What else would you be talking about if you saw the resurrected Christ?
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.120]   It was not for theological reasons.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:21.960]   It was not because to complete the gospel.
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:26.000]   It was not to understand the Trinity and his identity.
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.880]   It's simply because it happened.
[00:18:27.880 --> 00:18:29.920]   What else would you be talking about?
[00:18:29.920 --> 00:18:36.160]   What else would you be preaching if you met the resurrected Christ?
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:41.280]   If he was not resurrected from the dead, he said, all of it crumbles.
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:47.680]   Number two, if Jesus was not raised from the dead, we would still be in our sins.
[00:18:47.680 --> 00:18:51.960]   Chapter 15, verse 16, "For if the dead are not raised, not even Christ has been raised,
[00:18:51.960 --> 00:18:55.240]   and if Christ has not been raised, your faith is futile."
[00:18:55.240 --> 00:18:57.600]   Futile is another word for "seregi."
[00:18:57.600 --> 00:18:59.080]   Vanity.
[00:18:59.080 --> 00:19:00.840]   It's vain.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:01.880]   There's nothing to salvage.
[00:19:01.880 --> 00:19:07.520]   Your faith is futile, and you are still in your sins.
[00:19:07.520 --> 00:19:13.720]   Remember when Jesus was going into Jerusalem from Bethany?
[00:19:13.720 --> 00:19:17.280]   Something random happened, or at least on the surface it seems random.
[00:19:17.280 --> 00:19:21.600]   He's walking by, and he's hungry, and he walks toward the fig tree, and the fig tree doesn't
[00:19:21.600 --> 00:19:23.680]   have figs on it.
[00:19:23.680 --> 00:19:24.680]   And he just condemns it.
[00:19:24.680 --> 00:19:25.680]   Right?
[00:19:25.680 --> 00:19:26.680]   That's random.
[00:19:26.680 --> 00:19:30.040]   I mean, then he goes to the temple, cleanses the temple, and all this stuff happens, but
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:33.840]   then it just seems like Jesus has bad temper.
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:34.840]   Right?
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:38.640]   He gets angry at the fig tree, and then he goes to the temple, and he flips over tables
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:41.320]   like, "Ah, he just has a bad temper."
[00:19:41.320 --> 00:19:46.640]   I remember years ago, I was trying to share the gospel with this man, and we were going
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:51.040]   over other parts of the gospel, and he was really coming along.
[00:19:51.040 --> 00:19:54.800]   And he was asking questions about eternity, about the gospel, I was telling him what to
[00:19:54.800 --> 00:19:55.800]   read.
[00:19:55.800 --> 00:20:02.600]   And then one day, he said, he went into that story, and he said, "I don't understand the
[00:20:02.600 --> 00:20:03.600]   story.
[00:20:03.600 --> 00:20:05.040]   Why did he kill the fig tree?"
[00:20:05.040 --> 00:20:08.880]   So I did my best and tried to explain to him about, you know, berry fruit and things like
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:10.640]   that, and then he...
[00:20:10.640 --> 00:20:14.560]   You could tell he just didn't fully buy it.
[00:20:14.560 --> 00:20:18.360]   We'd move along and read something else, and then a couple weeks later, he would ask me,
[00:20:18.360 --> 00:20:21.520]   he's like, "I still can't get over that.
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:23.240]   Why did he kill the fig tree?"
[00:20:23.240 --> 00:20:27.720]   Now, I was thinking, like, all the things that he would stumble over, you know, the
[00:20:27.720 --> 00:20:33.560]   Jericho, the walls come tumbling down, or the worldwide flood where everybody dies.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:37.080]   You know, there's plenty of things that I would think that he would stumble over, the
[00:20:37.080 --> 00:20:40.240]   teaching of eternal hell and damnation.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:43.800]   There's so many things that I could think about, but he just could not get over this
[00:20:43.800 --> 00:20:46.560]   tree being condemned.
[00:20:46.560 --> 00:20:50.640]   And I think he had maybe a Buddhist background, and he considered that sacred, but he just
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:52.840]   could not let it go.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:56.280]   Why did he condemn the tree?
[00:20:56.280 --> 00:20:59.640]   Because of that, I took some time to really meditate and think about, like, why...
[00:20:59.640 --> 00:21:03.960]   Because it does seem random, at least on the surface.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:09.040]   You have to understand what Jesus came to do, and especially that week where he was
[00:21:09.040 --> 00:21:11.800]   headed.
[00:21:11.800 --> 00:21:17.600]   It says in Mark 11, verse 13, that the time of the gathering had not yet come.
[00:21:17.600 --> 00:21:24.440]   In other words, for most fig trees, the harvesting happens sometime in early summer, where it's
[00:21:24.440 --> 00:21:29.480]   full bloom and the farmers come and they get all the figs and they put it in a basket and
[00:21:29.480 --> 00:21:31.400]   they may eat it, dry it, or sell it.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:33.680]   In other words, he said that time had not come.
[00:21:33.680 --> 00:21:38.640]   So Jesus was walking probably sometime late March, maybe sometime in April.
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:43.160]   In other words, it was probably in full bloom, but not yet ready to harvest.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:47.000]   In other words, the tree should have been filled with fig tree, because they didn't
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:49.080]   harvest it yet.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:54.320]   And yet when he walked by, there was no figs on it, and he condemns it.
[00:21:54.320 --> 00:21:57.320]   Now, on the surface, he got caught up.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:21:58.680]   It was like, "Why did he condemn it?
[00:21:58.680 --> 00:21:59.680]   It didn't deserve it."
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:02.520]   Well, think about who Jesus is.
[00:22:02.520 --> 00:22:03.980]   Jesus is the creator.
[00:22:03.980 --> 00:22:10.680]   He created this fig tree for the purpose of bearing figs.
[00:22:10.680 --> 00:22:14.280]   And so it wasn't doing its job.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:21.280]   The whole purpose of a fig tree for its existence is to bear figs.
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.620]   So it wasn't doing its job.
[00:22:22.620 --> 00:22:28.880]   So basically, he had every right as the creator of this tree to say, "You're useless."
[00:22:28.880 --> 00:22:34.260]   Obviously, that was pointing to something greater than that.
[00:22:34.260 --> 00:22:40.040]   How many of us, if we created something, it didn't work, that we would put it in the corner
[00:22:40.040 --> 00:22:44.760]   and highlight it and take care of it and put it in the closet, right?
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:45.760]   You put it on Craigslist.
[00:22:45.760 --> 00:22:54.120]   Give it to White Elephant Present Exchange, bring in couponers, wherever it is.
[00:22:54.120 --> 00:22:58.120]   You just put it out, because you have no use for it, because you created it for something
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:00.880]   and it's not working.
[00:23:00.880 --> 00:23:03.060]   You wouldn't think twice about it, right?
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:05.040]   Get rid of it, because it's useless.
[00:23:05.040 --> 00:23:09.840]   It's not functioning the way I created it, what I created it for.
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:16.040]   The scripture says that we have all been created to give glory to God.
[00:23:16.040 --> 00:23:21.880]   All of creation cries out to His glory, except for mankind.
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:30.320]   Mankind is in rebellion against God, but instead of condemning us, what did He do?
[00:23:30.320 --> 00:23:33.160]   Instead of cursing us, what did He do?
[00:23:33.160 --> 00:23:36.440]   He took the curse upon Himself.
[00:23:36.440 --> 00:23:44.640]   What He did to the fig tree, if the fig tree deserved to die, how much more mankind who
[00:23:44.640 --> 00:23:50.880]   shakes His fist at God, saying, "I am not going to worship you."
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:54.400]   Yet instead of condemning mankind, He came, He absorbed sin upon Himself.
[00:23:54.400 --> 00:23:59.720]   He who knew no sin became sin, so that you and I might become the righteousness of God.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:03.960]   Scripture says in Hebrews 9.27, "Just as it is appointed for man to die once, after that
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:05.020]   comes judgment."
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.880]   This is the condition of all mankind.
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:13.280]   In Romans 6.23, "For the wages of sin is death."
[00:24:13.280 --> 00:24:19.760]   What He did to the fig tree is what every human being deserves in his sin.
[00:24:19.760 --> 00:24:26.440]   And yet He says, "If the resurrection did not happen, you are still in your sins."
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:31.720]   In 1 Timothy 1.15, it is a trustworthy statement, deserving full acceptance, that Christ Jesus
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:35.700]   came into the world to save sinners, among whom I am the foremost.
[00:24:35.700 --> 00:24:38.080]   This is the reason why He came.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:40.420]   He didn't come to relieve hunger.
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:44.460]   He didn't come to make your marriages better, so that you can have a better retirement or
[00:24:44.460 --> 00:24:53.220]   your business would go better, because the primary problem of mankind is inside.
[00:24:53.220 --> 00:24:58.460]   Changing the president, changing the society, making better investments, doesn't change
[00:24:58.460 --> 00:25:03.980]   anything.
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:09.140]   There has not been a president in the United States who is not a sinner.
[00:25:09.140 --> 00:25:15.660]   Whether you are a Republican or a Democrat, or Libertarian or just confused, whatever
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:22.860]   you may be, there has never been a president from the beginning till now and in the future
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:27.580]   who is not a sinner, who doesn't wrestle with his own lust, who doesn't wrestle with
[00:25:27.580 --> 00:25:28.580]   coveting.
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:32.540]   The answer is not the president.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:36.020]   Let me get a bit more personal.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:42.580]   None of you have been raised by anybody else other than a sinner.
[00:25:42.580 --> 00:25:44.860]   None of you.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:50.440]   Every single one of us has been raised by a mother who struggles with sin, by a father
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:53.220]   who also struggles with sin.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:26:00.500]   The answer is not with our family, because we are all sinners who have fallen short of
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:01.860]   the glory of God.
[00:26:01.860 --> 00:26:07.320]   The Bible describes this as the state of mankind.
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:10.580]   I've said this before, and I'm going to say this again because people keep reminding me
[00:26:10.580 --> 00:26:11.900]   over and over again.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:17.020]   I do not dislike Chinese food.
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:20.420]   I don't like food in China.
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   Let me say that again.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:26.940]   That's a lot more food, actually.
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:32.000]   The reason why I don't like food in China, and I'm going to say it again, because I've
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:34.300]   gotten sick so many times.
[00:26:34.300 --> 00:26:40.700]   Diarrhea, vomiting, everything that comes along with food poisoning.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:46.380]   I've experienced it so many times through traveling that I would go there for a week,
[00:26:46.380 --> 00:26:51.820]   two weeks, or three weeks, and if you have food poisoning, it ruins the trip.
[00:26:51.820 --> 00:26:53.940]   It doesn't matter how beautiful the place is.
[00:26:53.940 --> 00:26:55.140]   It doesn't matter the company.
[00:26:55.140 --> 00:26:59.980]   It doesn't matter the purpose or why I was there.
[00:26:59.980 --> 00:27:03.740]   If I get sick, it ruins everything.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:12.500]   So I'm hyper-cautious with what I eat in China and in India.
[00:27:12.500 --> 00:27:17.740]   Everywhere I travel, I'm very sensitive because I don't want to ruin the trip.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:20.060]   It doesn't matter if you get sick.
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:21.060]   It'll ruin everything.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:23.620]   It'll ruin your companionship.
[00:27:23.620 --> 00:27:25.060]   It'll ruin the travel.
[00:27:25.060 --> 00:27:28.260]   You can be in the most beautiful place in the world with the most beautiful people in
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:33.340]   the world, and you're going to be miserable.
[00:27:33.340 --> 00:27:40.500]   The state of mankind, the Bible says, is that we're all spiritually sick.
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.900]   You can have a perfect marriage.
[00:27:42.900 --> 00:27:46.100]   You can have a perfect group of friends.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:47.380]   You can have the best job.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:50.460]   You can have the most obedient child.
[00:27:50.460 --> 00:27:54.940]   But when we are sick spiritually, it ruins everything.
[00:27:54.940 --> 00:27:59.020]   That's what the Bible says that mankind experiences, and we're running, thinking that if we have
[00:27:59.020 --> 00:28:02.780]   the right president, if we have the right politics, if we have the right job, if we
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:07.140]   can communicate better with my wife, if I can raise better children, if I had better
[00:28:07.140 --> 00:28:12.020]   money for the retirement, that somehow that's going to fix things.
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:14.740]   It doesn't.
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:21.600]   Because the only answer to our sins is the resurrected Christ.
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:25.220]   And that's why it says if Christ has not been risen, we are still in our sins.
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:26.900]   All our preaching is in vain.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   Our faith is in vain.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.100]   It is absolute rubbish.
[00:28:31.100 --> 00:28:32.100]   There's nothing to salvage.
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:39.140]   Third and finally, it says if Jesus was not raised from the dead, death is final.
[00:28:39.140 --> 00:28:42.060]   That's it.
[00:28:42.060 --> 00:28:46.980]   I remember I went to one of the saddest funerals.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:50.780]   I've been to funerals where there's young children, and, you know, whether they were
[00:28:50.780 --> 00:28:54.460]   as young as two or five, you know.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:56.300]   And obviously, they're gut-wrenching funerals.
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:29:03.340]   But I went to one of the saddest funerals, this young man who died right after he graduated
[00:29:03.340 --> 00:29:04.340]   college.
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:10.620]   He went out, got drunk, on the way home, he swerved to the right, hit a tree, got thrown
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:14.460]   out of his car, and then he died.
[00:29:14.460 --> 00:29:21.020]   I went to his funeral and filled with unbelieving friends, unbelieving parents.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:25.180]   And at the eulogy, his dad came up trying to make sense.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:30.860]   This guy spent all his life, he just graduated UCSD, and, you know, his life is, you know,
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:34.780]   ahead of him, a bright future ahead of him.
[00:29:34.780 --> 00:29:40.820]   His dad comes up and he says, he looks at his son's friends who are sitting there grieving
[00:29:40.820 --> 00:29:43.620]   because their friend just died.
[00:29:43.620 --> 00:29:47.260]   He said, "Don't be stupid like my son.
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:50.900]   Don't be stupid like my son.
[00:29:50.900 --> 00:29:53.380]   He died uselessly.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:55.740]   Don't do that to yourself."
[00:29:55.740 --> 00:29:56.740]   Then he sat.
[00:29:56.740 --> 00:30:02.260]   That was a non-Christian trying to make sense.
[00:30:02.260 --> 00:30:03.260]   What happened?
[00:30:03.260 --> 00:30:07.820]   Poured his life into raising that child.
[00:30:07.820 --> 00:30:12.820]   Right when he graduates college and bright future ahead of him, all he can make sense
[00:30:12.820 --> 00:30:15.660]   of was, "It's over.
[00:30:15.660 --> 00:30:18.660]   Don't be stupid like him."
[00:30:18.660 --> 00:30:24.540]   Paul paused and said, "If Jesus was not resurrected from the dead and this is all we have, let
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.020]   us eat, drink, and be merry."
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:28.500]   What is this?
[00:30:28.500 --> 00:30:32.140]   Morality or make the world better.
[00:30:32.140 --> 00:30:33.140]   This is all you have.
[00:30:33.140 --> 00:30:36.700]   Let the next generation worry about the next generation.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:38.180]   This is it.
[00:30:38.180 --> 00:30:43.100]   If this is it, if death is final, it's it.
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:46.580]   But Romans 8 and 11, it says, "If the spirit of him who raised Jesus from the dead dwells
[00:30:46.580 --> 00:30:50.940]   in you, he who raised Christ Jesus from the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies
[00:30:50.940 --> 00:30:54.080]   through his spirit who dwells in you."
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:58.780]   This resurrection is not simply about Jesus' resurrection.
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:03.780]   He was the first fruit among many who will be resurrected.
[00:31:03.780 --> 00:31:09.580]   So when we celebrate the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we're celebrating the hope that one
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:14.340]   day when we die, we will also be resurrected like him.
[00:31:14.340 --> 00:31:16.500]   But death is not final.
[00:31:16.500 --> 00:31:20.540]   That whatever it is that you experience here, it is not final.
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:24.540]   That's why it says in verse 42 and on, "So also is the resurrection of the dead.
[00:31:24.540 --> 00:31:29.940]   It is sown perishable body, it is raised an imperishable body.
[00:31:29.940 --> 00:31:31.740]   It is sown in dishonor, it is raised in glory.
[00:31:31.740 --> 00:31:34.020]   It is sown in weakness, it is raised in power.
[00:31:34.020 --> 00:31:38.940]   It is sown natural body, it is raised a spiritual body."
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:39.940]   Perishable body.
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:43.740]   Basically, this is describing our current state.
[00:31:43.740 --> 00:31:47.260]   You and I have a perishable body.
[00:31:47.260 --> 00:31:48.260]   There is dishonor.
[00:31:48.260 --> 00:31:50.780]   Yes, we're Christians.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:53.220]   We've been washed by the blood of Christ.
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:55.060]   But let's be real.
[00:31:55.060 --> 00:31:56.060]   There's lust in us.
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:57.060]   There's coveting.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:31:58.060]   There's anger.
[00:31:58.060 --> 00:31:59.740]   There's slander.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.480]   We wrestle and we struggle.
[00:32:01.480 --> 00:32:04.500]   And this is what he says.
[00:32:04.500 --> 00:32:06.820]   We will be sown in weakness but raised in power.
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:10.480]   We'll be sown natural body but we'll be raised with a spiritual body.
[00:32:10.480 --> 00:32:16.800]   The word for perishable basically means corruption, decay, ruined, ultimately leading to death.
[00:32:16.800 --> 00:32:22.540]   And that's why in 1 Corinthians 1.18, the gospel describes those who are not Christians
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:27.360]   as those who are continuing to perish.
[00:32:27.360 --> 00:32:32.840]   Psalm 90 verse 12, "So teach us to number our days that we may present to you a heart
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:33.840]   of wisdom."
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:34.840]   You know what he's saying?
[00:32:35.440 --> 00:32:41.840]   Say, "Lord, teach me to know that I'm going to die one day."
[00:32:41.840 --> 00:32:45.320]   And just how this life is.
[00:32:45.320 --> 00:32:49.880]   What a morbid thing to say, especially on a resurrected Sunday.
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:53.640]   Many of you, I did not know you owned a tie.
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:56.480]   It's Resurrection Sunday.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:32:59.080]   You dressed up nice.
[00:32:59.080 --> 00:33:01.320]   Because it's supposed to be about life, about resurrection.
[00:33:01.320 --> 00:33:03.360]   It's supposed to be happy.
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:07.880]   He says, "Lord, teach me to number my days."
[00:33:07.880 --> 00:33:11.840]   He says, "To gain a heart of wisdom."
[00:33:11.840 --> 00:33:15.180]   Now why does he say that?
[00:33:15.180 --> 00:33:22.480]   Because until we recognize that we are living in a perishable body, that we would not look
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:27.040]   to the Lord who has eternity in His hands.
[00:33:27.040 --> 00:33:32.980]   We're going to pour all our energy and our time and our hope in that which is perishable.
[00:33:32.980 --> 00:33:39.880]   That's why he says, "To have a heart of wisdom that we need to know how short this life is."
[00:33:39.880 --> 00:33:44.160]   I remember my 25th birthday like it was yesterday.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:46.720]   And I know people say that.
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:48.900]   There's plenty of people in this room who are older than me, so I'm not going to act
[00:33:48.900 --> 00:33:51.280]   like I'm old.
[00:33:51.280 --> 00:33:54.760]   But it really feels like yesterday.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:56.880]   I just got married.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:01.840]   It was my first birthday that we were celebrating as a married couple.
[00:34:01.840 --> 00:34:03.760]   She threw a birthday party.
[00:34:03.760 --> 00:34:05.640]   All the youth group kids came.
[00:34:05.640 --> 00:34:10.400]   And I remember walking into the room and she had this Korean soup that she made for me
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.440]   that she knew I liked.
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:13.600]   And I remember every part of that.
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:17.200]   I lived in an apartment in Tustin.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.440]   And I remember who was there.
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.640]   I remember what we talked about.
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:25.920]   I mean, it was just so memorable for me because it was my first birthday with my new wife.
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:28.600]   That seemed like yesterday.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:30.000]   It went by that fast.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:33.400]   I mean, we're like a mist that comes and goes.
[00:34:33.400 --> 00:34:38.040]   And I know when we're younger, we live like we have all the time in the world.
[00:34:38.040 --> 00:34:41.080]   But one of the benefits of getting older is you know that's not the case.
[00:34:41.080 --> 00:34:44.400]   I don't have to convince older people that that's not the case.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:45.800]   What I'm saying is not anything unique.
[00:34:45.800 --> 00:34:47.400]   You probably heard it from everybody else.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:52.880]   He says, "Teach me to number my days so that I may know the preciousness of what it is
[00:34:52.880 --> 00:34:58.880]   that I have, that I may look to eternity."
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:35:07.420]   We live in this perishable body until we recognize what it is that we have.
[00:35:07.420 --> 00:35:11.440]   We don't recognize what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.060]   Paul says in Romans chapter 7, "What I want to do, I do not do.
[00:35:15.060 --> 00:35:16.880]   What I do not want to do, I keep on doing."
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:21.120]   And then he says, "Oh, what a wretched man that I am."
[00:35:21.120 --> 00:35:27.600]   Until we recognize the wretchedness of the position that you and I are in, we think that
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:30.160]   we're going to be here forever.
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:33.440]   We enjoy life like everybody else.
[00:35:33.440 --> 00:35:38.400]   We celebrate over little accomplishments that in eternity means nothing.
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:42.920]   We celebrate, take pictures of little nice places that we visited and that keeps us going
[00:35:42.920 --> 00:35:44.760]   for a period.
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:51.760]   We go eat things, experience things, buy things that temporarily causes us to forget the bigger
[00:35:51.760 --> 00:35:53.360]   picture.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:58.880]   And we just move on from month to month, week to week, year to year, and from life
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:05.800]   to life, forgetting about the eternity.
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.600]   But Paul doesn't leave it there.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.560]   "Oh, what a wretched man that I am."
[00:36:11.560 --> 00:36:16.800]   But in the very next passage he says, "But thanks be to God that there is deliverance."
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:19.800]   And that's what the resurrection is.
[00:36:19.800 --> 00:36:25.240]   The resurrection reminds us that even though we will die with perishable body, we will
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:27.320]   be raised with imperishable.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:31.280]   First Corinthians 15, 52, "In a moment, in a twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet,
[00:36:31.280 --> 00:36:36.000]   for the trumpet will sound and the dead will be raised imperishable and we will be changed.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:41.880]   For the perishable must put on the imperishable and the mortal must put on immortality."
[00:36:41.880 --> 00:36:52.160]   We will be sown in dishonor, which means disgrace, lust, covening, anger, pride, and shame.
[00:36:52.160 --> 00:36:56.000]   But we will be raised in glory.
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:37:05.520]   You know, so much of our life is really about self-glory, right?
[00:37:05.520 --> 00:37:08.360]   That's why we spend so much time in front of the mirror in the morning.
[00:37:08.360 --> 00:37:12.440]   So we want to present our best.
[00:37:12.440 --> 00:37:18.120]   Sometimes we study so hard because we want to make something of ourselves.
[00:37:18.120 --> 00:37:20.320]   We want to get a better job.
[00:37:20.320 --> 00:37:30.440]   All of it for greater glory, for improvement, not realizing that our core pursuit of our
[00:37:30.440 --> 00:37:37.180]   own glory is what is suffocating the life that God desires for us.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:42.400]   He says, "We are now hidden in Christ."
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:49.200]   When He comes in glory, we will be glorified with Him.
[00:37:49.200 --> 00:37:56.320]   Resurrection is a promise that no matter what happens in this world, that Christ is going
[00:37:56.320 --> 00:37:58.420]   to come and bring glory.
[00:37:58.420 --> 00:38:07.080]   We will be sown in weakness, physically, emotionally, intellectually, and by our will.
[00:38:07.080 --> 00:38:08.640]   There's a reason why He says, "Do not trust your heart.
[00:38:08.640 --> 00:38:12.360]   It is deceitful because our emotions have been tainted."
[00:38:12.360 --> 00:38:16.920]   He says, "Do not lean on your own understanding because our intellect has been tainted by
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:17.920]   sin.
[00:38:17.920 --> 00:38:21.040]   Do not make vows because you don't know if you're going to be able to keep it because
[00:38:21.040 --> 00:38:25.460]   our wills have been affected by our sin."
[00:38:25.460 --> 00:38:27.640]   Even physically.
[00:38:27.640 --> 00:38:32.080]   I remember, you know, in my early 40s, my knee started hurting and I went to the doctors
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:35.360]   and the doctor looked at my knees and he said, "Basically, stop playing basketball."
[00:38:35.360 --> 00:38:39.440]   Some of you guys who are obsessed with basketball may understand.
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:43.320]   The other people kind of like, "You're going to think that I'm crazy."
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:47.560]   But I remember when he told me to stop playing basketball, I felt like a part of my life
[00:38:47.560 --> 00:38:53.400]   was dying because I played so much basketball when I was younger.
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:54.840]   We were obsessed with that.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:59.600]   I was maybe a little idle, you know what I mean?
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:03.160]   This is before internet.
[00:39:03.160 --> 00:39:05.600]   So what else you got, right?
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:08.200]   I couldn't drive to LA to get food.
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.200]   We just played basketball.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.320]   All our free time, we played basketball.
[00:39:12.320 --> 00:39:16.560]   I literally played basketball maybe six, seven times a week sometimes.
[00:39:16.560 --> 00:39:21.000]   And I was a youth pastor, so I was always with guys who were more than willing to play.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:23.520]   And so I was so...
[00:39:23.520 --> 00:39:24.720]   We played so much basketball.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:28.400]   So when finally when the doctor said, "Your knee can't handle it anymore.
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:31.240]   You overused it and you should stop playing basketball."
[00:39:31.240 --> 00:39:35.280]   I remember coming home thinking, "I need to get a second opinion."
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.320]   That's the first thought I had.
[00:39:38.320 --> 00:39:43.000]   And then later on when I realized that that was probably the case, a small part of me
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   died.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   It is a part of me that should have died because I was too competitive.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:50.800]   I took basketball way too seriously.
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:53.600]   And there's probably some people in this room who were stumbled because of it.
[00:39:53.600 --> 00:39:57.920]   So it was a good thing that I couldn't play competitively anymore.
[00:39:57.920 --> 00:40:04.480]   So it was a reminder to me that no matter how healthy you are, no matter how strong
[00:40:04.480 --> 00:40:11.360]   you are, no matter how young you are, it takes its toll on all of us in time.
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:18.880]   He said, "We will be sown in weakness, but we will be raised in power."
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:26.600]   You know the comic books, the Avengers, and all this has become so popular in recent days.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:31.440]   So the common question that people ask each other is, "What superpower would you want?"
[00:40:31.440 --> 00:40:32.440]   Like fantasy.
[00:40:32.440 --> 00:40:35.840]   People always ask, "What would you do with a million dollars if you won the lottery?"
[00:40:35.840 --> 00:40:38.080]   Now it's like, "What superpower do you want?
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:40.360]   Which character would you want?"
[00:40:40.360 --> 00:40:45.600]   I hear some people say, "I wanted the power to be invisible."
[00:40:45.600 --> 00:40:48.440]   Or "I want to be Batman."
[00:40:48.440 --> 00:40:50.600]   Or "I want to be able to do this and that."
[00:40:50.600 --> 00:40:54.400]   And I never understood why people don't say Superman.
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:58.360]   Because Superman basically can do everything.
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:01.520]   Why do you have to be invisible when you can beat everybody up?
[00:41:01.520 --> 00:41:04.080]   Why do you have to worry about what other people think?
[00:41:04.080 --> 00:41:08.760]   He's fast enough to turn the globe backwards and change time.
[00:41:08.760 --> 00:41:10.240]   He's faster than the fastest guy.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:11.560]   He's stronger than the strongest guy.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:12.880]   Why not Superman?
[00:41:12.880 --> 00:41:18.680]   Anyway, why people even choose anything else, I don't understand.
[00:41:18.680 --> 00:41:20.480]   But that's all fantasy.
[00:41:20.480 --> 00:41:21.480]   That's not reality.
[00:41:21.480 --> 00:41:24.200]   We're just kind of thinking, "Oh, if I was, if I did this."
[00:41:24.200 --> 00:41:31.280]   But the Scripture says that when Christ was resurrected and he became the first fruit
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:39.200]   among many, that Jesus Christ is the heir of all that God is.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:43.280]   The God who controls the universe, who created the universe, who created the universe that
[00:41:43.280 --> 00:41:46.680]   contains Superman.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:50.000]   That God, Jesus Christ, is the heir of all things.
[00:41:50.000 --> 00:41:53.600]   And he said, "Because we become adopted children, we are what?
[00:41:53.600 --> 00:41:55.960]   Co-heirs with Christ."
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.120]   So this idea of wanting to be Superman is just a fantasy.
[00:42:00.120 --> 00:42:05.960]   But the reality of his resurrection is when we die and when Christ comes in glory, we
[00:42:05.960 --> 00:42:10.000]   are going to be co-heirs with Christ.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:11.120]   We don't need to fantasize.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:18.280]   If you truly believe in the resurrection of Jesus Christ, how can we hope for anything
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:24.920]   less than what Christ has done for us in his resurrection?
[00:42:24.920 --> 00:42:30.120]   It is sown a natural body, but we will be raised a spiritual body.
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:36.280]   Heaven, never in the Scripture, is described as a place where you're going to go live in
[00:42:36.280 --> 00:42:37.280]   a big mansion.
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:40.720]   You know, when we were little, I don't know about you, but I've heard so many stories
[00:42:40.720 --> 00:42:42.760]   about this mansion that's waiting.
[00:42:42.760 --> 00:42:45.840]   So when I was little, I pictured a mansion, right?
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.120]   My parents weren't rich, so we never had a nice house.
[00:42:48.120 --> 00:42:52.480]   So I was like, "One of these days, we're going to live in the biggest mansion, and I'm going
[00:42:52.480 --> 00:42:56.640]   to work so hard, and I'm going to sacrifice, bring many people to Christ, so when I get
[00:42:56.640 --> 00:43:00.160]   to heaven, I'm going to be the rich guy."
[00:43:00.160 --> 00:43:01.160]   It's not here.
[00:43:01.160 --> 00:43:03.080]   I look for it.
[00:43:03.080 --> 00:43:04.120]   It's not in the Bible.
[00:43:04.120 --> 00:43:06.880]   There is no mansion promised us.
[00:43:06.880 --> 00:43:10.200]   There's no Lamborghini.
[00:43:10.200 --> 00:43:15.640]   There's no promise that when we get to heaven that we're going to be better looking.
[00:43:15.640 --> 00:43:18.440]   It's just not going to matter.
[00:43:18.440 --> 00:43:20.320]   It's not in the Scripture.
[00:43:20.320 --> 00:43:24.720]   The only consistent thing that's mentioned in Scripture is that heaven is a place where
[00:43:24.720 --> 00:43:29.440]   God dwells, and there is no sin.
[00:43:29.440 --> 00:43:32.200]   That's it.
[00:43:32.200 --> 00:43:36.040]   I don't think it's going to look a lot different than here, to be honest.
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:38.800]   I don't know if there's going to be brown chairs.
[00:43:38.800 --> 00:43:41.240]   I don't know what the food is going to be like.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:45.960]   It doesn't describe it, but I don't think it's going to be a lot different than this,
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:51.200]   because what ruined creation is not the dirt.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:58.320]   What ruined creation is not the weather, is not the depleting ozone layer.
[00:43:58.320 --> 00:44:00.720]   It was us.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:04.680]   It was the sin in us that ruined it.
[00:44:04.680 --> 00:44:10.400]   When he was resurrected, he said, "He's going to take us to a place where God dwells, and
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:13.160]   there is no more sin.
[00:44:13.160 --> 00:44:18.320]   And when there is no sin, there is no more crying.
[00:44:18.320 --> 00:44:23.520]   When there is no sin, there is no frustration.
[00:44:23.520 --> 00:44:28.560]   Where there is no sin, there are no empty promises.
[00:44:28.560 --> 00:44:33.360]   When there is no sin, there is no more loneliness.
[00:44:33.360 --> 00:44:37.860]   Where there is no sin, there is no shame.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:42.920]   Where there is no sin, there is no broken families.
[00:44:42.920 --> 00:44:48.520]   When there is no sin, there is no more lust, there's no more hatred, no more slander, no
[00:44:48.520 --> 00:44:50.320]   more coveting.
[00:44:50.320 --> 00:44:54.400]   All our hungering and thirsting are going to be satisfied.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.760]   There are no orphans.
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.720]   There is no war.
[00:44:58.720 --> 00:45:03.640]   When there is no sin.
[00:45:03.640 --> 00:45:08.640]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:45:08.640 --> 00:45:17.800]   Some of you, some of you live with physical pain.
[00:45:17.800 --> 00:45:19.300]   And you've tried everything.
[00:45:19.300 --> 00:45:24.600]   There's some relief, but in the end, it's just for years, you're suffering, you've taken
[00:45:24.600 --> 00:45:29.640]   medication, you've done everything possible, and you're slowly beginning to realize that
[00:45:29.640 --> 00:45:34.640]   maybe that is it.
[00:45:34.640 --> 00:45:42.320]   Some of you come from broken families, and the scars of being raised in a home where
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:48.360]   there was constant contention and those memories haunt you.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:53.880]   You're afraid of relationships as a result of that.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:46:00.160]   Some of you have been molested.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:07.440]   You've been molested by people that you trusted, and you don't know what to do with that.
[00:46:07.440 --> 00:46:16.440]   I don't know how many people that I've prayed for or talked to seeking some relief for what's
[00:46:16.440 --> 00:46:19.360]   happened.
[00:46:19.360 --> 00:46:20.360]   And there is not.
[00:46:20.360 --> 00:46:22.520]   It's not here.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:33.360]   And they live with that horrendous memory in their teens, 20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, 60s, 70s.
[00:46:33.360 --> 00:46:37.400]   Some of you were raised and you don't know your mom.
[00:46:37.400 --> 00:46:40.440]   You've never known your mom.
[00:46:40.440 --> 00:46:46.480]   Some of you were raised and you have no recollection of your dad.
[00:46:46.480 --> 00:46:53.720]   Some of you are suffocating because of financial burdens.
[00:46:53.720 --> 00:47:03.760]   If Christ was not raised from the dead, that's all you got.
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.080]   You just got handed a raw deal.
[00:47:08.080 --> 00:47:13.800]   Just suck it up and move on because that's it.
[00:47:13.800 --> 00:47:14.800]   It just happened.
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:17.480]   What do you do?
[00:47:17.480 --> 00:47:26.040]   And some of you, some of you are living with the shame of what you did in the past, and
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:29.080]   you just cannot get over it.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:33.680]   If Christ was not raised from the dead, my preaching is in vain.
[00:47:33.680 --> 00:47:36.460]   There's no encouragement in any of this.
[00:47:36.460 --> 00:47:39.180]   Our faith is in vain.
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:40.820]   This life is it.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.280]   There is no hope.
[00:47:42.280 --> 00:47:46.800]   And once you die, once you die, that's it.
[00:47:46.800 --> 00:47:55.200]   You live with the pain of living in this fallen world, and that's it.
[00:47:55.200 --> 00:48:00.040]   And the only hope that you have is that one day you will die, and that's it, and suffering
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.480]   is over.
[00:48:02.480 --> 00:48:12.240]   If Christ was not raised from the dead, that's it.
[00:48:12.240 --> 00:48:15.720]   Is this it?
[00:48:15.720 --> 00:48:24.200]   All these kids who are sleeping without food in their stomach, children in Kenya, both
[00:48:24.200 --> 00:48:31.360]   parents died because of AIDS walking around homeless, young girls who are being forced
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:38.040]   into prostitution because they just happened to be born in a home that the parents did
[00:48:38.040 --> 00:48:42.600]   not have enough money to take care of.
[00:48:42.600 --> 00:48:44.700]   That's it.
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:57.280]   If Christ is not raised, all we can say is tough luck, tough luck.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:00.120]   Thank God that that's not me.
[00:49:00.120 --> 00:49:04.280]   Thank God that's not my children.
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:14.840]   If Christ was not raised from the dead, his resurrection changes everything.
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.720]   It changes everything.
[00:49:17.720 --> 00:49:26.840]   He didn't die to give us a placebo, to hold on to this empty blanket, to feel a little
[00:49:26.840 --> 00:49:31.120]   bit better about ourselves.
[00:49:31.120 --> 00:49:35.520]   The hope of the resurrection is real hope.
[00:49:35.520 --> 00:49:37.180]   It is real life.
[00:49:37.180 --> 00:49:39.360]   It is real forgiveness.
[00:49:39.360 --> 00:49:42.780]   It is real resurrection.
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:52.800]   I want to encourage you, those of you who are here who do not know Christ, maybe all
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:57.980]   the questions that you have and why this life just does not make sense is because you've
[00:49:57.980 --> 00:50:02.360]   been separated from the Creator.
[00:50:02.360 --> 00:50:06.240]   God created you for a purpose and you have no idea what that is.
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:09.360]   And you're just trying to make sense of why you're here, where we're headed, where we
[00:50:09.360 --> 00:50:12.940]   came from, and you just can't get the answer.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:18.640]   Could it possibly be you're looking for answers outside of the only one who can give you that
[00:50:18.640 --> 00:50:20.400]   answer?
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:24.420]   What separates us from this Creator, the Bible says, is our own sins.
[00:50:24.420 --> 00:50:28.860]   And until we confess our sins, there's a barrier between us and God that we can never get to
[00:50:28.860 --> 00:50:30.260]   Him.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:32.600]   And that's why Jesus Christ came.
[00:50:32.600 --> 00:50:35.020]   What you and I could not do, Jesus did.
[00:50:35.020 --> 00:50:40.520]   Instead of condemning us like that fig tree, He put that guilt, He put that shame upon
[00:50:40.520 --> 00:50:43.180]   His Son and He absorbed it.
[00:50:43.180 --> 00:50:49.460]   But not only did He absorb it, He was resurrected and given us new life.
[00:50:49.460 --> 00:50:53.380]   I met the Lord years ago.
[00:50:53.380 --> 00:50:56.940]   I had so much anger and pain.
[00:50:56.940 --> 00:51:04.260]   But the moment I met the Lord, everything made sense.
[00:51:04.260 --> 00:51:10.980]   A God who is completely sovereign allowed those things to happen to bring me to Him.
[00:51:10.980 --> 00:51:16.860]   To everything that I was angry about, overnight I found my answer in Christ.
[00:51:16.860 --> 00:51:23.900]   What could have easily led to years of anger and rebellion turned into source for greater
[00:51:23.900 --> 00:51:27.180]   joy in Christ?
[00:51:27.180 --> 00:51:34.740]   I want to encourage you, if that's you, you're searching and you're lost, and you've been
[00:51:34.740 --> 00:51:40.140]   trying to look for it in your friends, your family, your parents, in government, in education
[00:51:40.140 --> 00:51:44.340]   and in money or experience.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:49.020]   Heaven is in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:51:49.020 --> 00:51:51.900]   I believe that with all my heart.
[00:51:51.900 --> 00:52:01.220]   I've dedicated my whole life because I believe that with all my heart.
[00:52:01.220 --> 00:52:08.060]   Jesus is real.
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:13.500]   He actually was raised from the dead.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:16.660]   Heaven is real.
[00:52:16.660 --> 00:52:20.220]   Don't treat Him like a placebo.
[00:52:20.220 --> 00:52:26.980]   If you haven't prayed to Him in a while, if you haven't searched Him in a while, if you
[00:52:26.980 --> 00:52:32.100]   haven't connected with Him in a while, there's nothing more important for you to do today
[00:52:32.100 --> 00:52:39.660]   than to cry out to the Lord and receive forgiveness.
[00:52:39.660 --> 00:52:42.420]   Come to the Lord.
[00:52:42.420 --> 00:52:49.100]   There's nothing more important in this world than to receive this Jesus, ask for forgiveness,
[00:52:49.100 --> 00:52:53.820]   to be reconciled with the Creator, and then live the rest of your life telling other people
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:56.140]   the same.
[00:52:56.140 --> 00:53:00.820]   Everything else is vanity.
[00:53:00.820 --> 00:53:17.580]   Would you take some time to pray with me?
[00:53:17.580 --> 00:53:26.260]   Some of you might be sitting there thinking, "I've heard this so many times, and I believe
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:27.260]   it.
[00:53:27.260 --> 00:53:31.060]   I confess, I do believe it."
[00:53:31.060 --> 00:53:33.300]   Let me ask you again.
[00:53:33.300 --> 00:53:41.500]   If the resurrection did not happen, what will you lose today?
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.720]   What did you give up?
[00:53:43.720 --> 00:53:46.500]   What have you sacrificed?
[00:53:46.500 --> 00:53:51.660]   What is it about your life that you would say, "If He wasn't raised from the dead, my
[00:53:51.660 --> 00:54:00.900]   life is empty, because I gave everything to follow Him, because I believe this."
[00:54:00.900 --> 00:54:07.580]   The resurrection demands, it demands our confession.
[00:54:07.580 --> 00:54:16.940]   Either we believe it and give our life in exchange for His, or we don't believe it and
[00:54:16.940 --> 00:54:20.480]   salvage what we can.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:25.020]   I pray with all my heart that that is not the case.
[00:54:25.020 --> 00:54:34.260]   I pray with all my heart that you would come to the conviction that we celebrate the bodily
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:38.220]   resurrection, the real resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:54:38.220 --> 00:54:43.780]   And one day when He comes, we will be glorified with Him.
[00:54:43.780 --> 00:54:46.300]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
