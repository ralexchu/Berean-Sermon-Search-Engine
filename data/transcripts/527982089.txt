[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   Hi there.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.300]   My name is Mark and many of you may not know me, but that's okay because I've only been
[00:00:14.300 --> 00:00:17.200]   coming to Berean for a few months now.
[00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:20.780]   And so today I have the privilege of sharing my testimony.
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:26.660]   So I was actually raised up in the church by my parents and growing up, I never really
[00:00:26.660 --> 00:00:29.580]   liked it or felt passionate about it.
[00:00:29.580 --> 00:00:34.480]   It was something that felt like more of my parents' faith and not mine.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:38.760]   And so as I grew up, I actually slowly started to despise it.
[00:00:38.760 --> 00:00:47.100]   But as I got older, I started having thoughts like, why do I have to follow all these rules
[00:00:47.100 --> 00:00:50.560]   that don't apply to most people?
[00:00:50.560 --> 00:00:56.580]   And as I got, sometimes I even felt like I was an outsider at school, but I just chose
[00:00:56.580 --> 00:01:00.700]   to ignore this feeling because I just tried to fit in.
[00:01:00.700 --> 00:01:06.340]   So actually, because I was raised up in the church, it's always made me recognize how
[00:01:06.340 --> 00:01:11.220]   there is a God, yet I chose to just ignore him because I didn't want to feel guilty about
[00:01:11.220 --> 00:01:13.300]   any of my sins.
[00:01:13.300 --> 00:01:17.740]   It seemed like a burden having to repent when I know that I'm just going to be making the
[00:01:17.740 --> 00:01:20.940]   same mistakes or sinning again in the future.
[00:01:20.940 --> 00:01:23.980]   And so I chose to just ignore him.
[00:01:23.980 --> 00:01:25.760]   I forgot about him.
[00:01:25.760 --> 00:01:30.700]   And sometimes I even twisted what God meant to me so that I can use him to serve myself
[00:01:30.700 --> 00:01:35.660]   instead of serving him.
[00:01:35.660 --> 00:01:39.700]   And for a majority of my life, I've continued to think this way.
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:45.140]   But recently this summer, God actually made me realize just how sinful this world is and
[00:01:45.140 --> 00:01:49.740]   also how I am just so much like it.
[00:01:49.740 --> 00:01:53.140]   All I cared about was myself and what made me happy.
[00:01:53.140 --> 00:01:59.980]   So last semester when I was dorming at Cal State Long Beach, I wasn't attending any churches
[00:01:59.980 --> 00:02:03.100]   because quite honestly, I didn't feel like it.
[00:02:03.100 --> 00:02:08.020]   I wondered what it was like having an entire day of the weekend all to myself.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:12.500]   Again, as you can see, my selfishness.
[00:02:12.500 --> 00:02:16.460]   But thinking about it now, I realized that God was working in my life to bring me to
[00:02:16.460 --> 00:02:17.460]   Berean.
[00:02:17.460 --> 00:02:22.980]   Berean caught my eye with the realization of just how much there was to learn about
[00:02:22.980 --> 00:02:27.300]   God and honestly, also just how welcoming everyone was.
[00:02:27.300 --> 00:02:34.540]   At first, this welcoming of the large ministry that I'm not used to was what kept me attracted
[00:02:34.540 --> 00:02:37.820]   to Berean and I kept coming because of it.
[00:02:37.820 --> 00:02:42.500]   But as I kept coming, I learned more about God and his word.
[00:02:42.500 --> 00:02:49.540]   And ultimately, I also just realized how short my understanding was in Christianity.
[00:02:49.540 --> 00:02:55.020]   Before all of this, I actually thought that I was already saved because I knew that God
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:02:58.020]   died for me on the cross as a mere fact.
[00:02:58.020 --> 00:03:05.420]   But what I didn't know was like, I didn't live my life as if he was actually my Lord.
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:10.860]   And so God made me realize just how great my sins were against them and how Jesus is
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:13.660]   actually the only one who's able to save me.
[00:03:13.660 --> 00:03:18.980]   So just as it is written in Ephesians 2.8, "For by grace you have been saved through
[00:03:18.980 --> 00:03:21.780]   faith and this is not your own doing.
[00:03:21.780 --> 00:03:23.740]   It is the gift of God."
[00:03:23.740 --> 00:03:29.420]   He's shown me grace by giving me a new heart and making me alive so that I can now follow
[00:03:29.420 --> 00:03:31.580]   and love him by faith.
[00:03:31.580 --> 00:03:35.560]   He's made me recognize what he's done for me and just how grateful I should be because
[00:03:35.560 --> 00:03:38.220]   of it.
[00:03:38.220 --> 00:03:43.460]   Now it's all about living a life that's glorifying to the Lord and having my own relationship
[00:03:43.460 --> 00:03:44.960]   with him.
[00:03:44.960 --> 00:03:51.140]   Without him, I'd still be just as dead in my sin and an enemy of God.
[00:03:51.140 --> 00:03:57.380]   But because he opened my heart or opened my eyes and gave me a new heart, I now no longer
[00:03:57.380 --> 00:04:02.860]   desire to follow the world, but I follow Jesus as my Lord and savior.
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:03.860]   Thank you.
[00:04:03.860 --> 00:04:13.860]   [applause]
[00:04:13.860 --> 00:04:35.860]   >> Mark, thanks for sharing your testimony with us.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:41.380]   Mark, do you understand that by entering into the water, you're expressing your union with
[00:04:41.380 --> 00:04:45.300]   Christ in his death and that by coming out of the water, you're expressing your union
[00:04:45.300 --> 00:04:46.300]   with Christ in his resurrected life?
[00:04:46.300 --> 00:04:47.300]   >> I do.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   >> And I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:48.300]   [applause]
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:49.300]   >> I'm Mark.
[00:04:49.300 --> 00:04:50.300]   I'm a pastor.
[00:04:50.300 --> 00:04:51.300]   I'm a pastor.
[00:04:51.300 --> 00:04:52.300]   I'm a pastor.
[00:04:52.300 --> 00:04:53.300]   I'm a pastor.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:04:54.300]   [applause]
[00:04:54.300 --> 00:05:04.300]   [applause]
