[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.240]   Welcome to a new week of episodes in the podcast.
[00:00:07.240 --> 00:00:10.600]   The first question of the week comes from Ivan, who asks this, "Pastor
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:12.340]   John, I'm a pastor here in the Philippines.
[00:00:12.340 --> 00:00:16.440]   I began to embrace Christian hedonism about three years ago.
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.780]   Ever since it's been my passion to spread the truth that God is most glorified in
[00:00:20.780 --> 00:00:24.000]   us when we are most satisfied in Him.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:24.620]   Amen."
[00:00:24.620 --> 00:00:28.780]   This has become the foundation of everything I do in ministry, even the
[00:00:28.780 --> 00:00:32.400]   focal point of everything I say in the pulpit, as well as in my Bible studies.
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:36.340]   Your book, When I Don't Desire God, really influenced me.
[00:00:36.340 --> 00:00:39.460]   Ever since then, my main ministry has been to remind God's people that
[00:00:39.460 --> 00:00:43.280]   they should fight for joy, to train them how to fight for joy, to teach them
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.980]   why they should fight for joy and what it really means, and to show them how this
[00:00:46.980 --> 00:00:49.880]   fight is related to other teachings in the Bible.
[00:00:49.880 --> 00:00:51.620]   Now, here's my question.
[00:00:51.620 --> 00:00:55.800]   Is it possible for me to overemphasize Christian hedonism?
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.440]   And how would I know if I was?
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:01:06.660]   The first part of the answer is simple, but the second part is not so simple
[00:01:06.660 --> 00:01:10.100]   and is certainly not simple to implement.
[00:01:10.100 --> 00:01:17.140]   So the first part of the answer is simply yes, it is possible to
[00:01:17.140 --> 00:01:23.840]   overemphasize Christian hedonism, just like it is possible to overemphasize
[00:01:24.380 --> 00:01:33.420]   joy or sorrow or pain or death or heaven or hell or the deity of Christ or the
[00:01:33.420 --> 00:01:38.160]   sovereignty of God or the call to missions or the cause of justice.
[00:01:38.160 --> 00:01:44.440]   Yes, it is possible to overemphasize Christian hedonism because it is
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:47.600]   possible to overemphasize anything.
[00:01:48.820 --> 00:01:56.620]   So the second part of the question, how would I know, how can I recognize if
[00:01:56.620 --> 00:02:00.860]   I'm overemphasizing something like Christian hedonism, what are the signs?
[00:02:00.860 --> 00:02:07.240]   That part of the question is not so easy to answer and even more
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:10.700]   difficult to implement in our lives.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:15.860]   But let's give it a try, because I really do think we need to know some
[00:02:16.060 --> 00:02:20.800]   yellow flags that we can be aware of that we're going in the wrong direction.
[00:02:20.800 --> 00:02:29.580]   Number one, we are overemphasizing a truth when our emphasis is not in sync
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:36.520]   with the way the scriptures emphasize the truth, and I do mean emphasize
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:40.420]   the truth, not emphasize the term.
[00:02:40.980 --> 00:02:47.300]   Lots of wonderful historic theological terms are not very often used in the
[00:02:47.300 --> 00:02:53.420]   Bible, like Trinity, substitutionary atonement, beatific vision, deity of
[00:02:53.420 --> 00:03:00.340]   Christ, but are pervasive in the scriptures, even though the terms may not be used.
[00:03:00.340 --> 00:03:09.740]   So the point is not, does our use of a term occur at a frequency similar to the
[00:03:09.740 --> 00:03:11.620]   biblical use of a term?
[00:03:11.620 --> 00:03:13.020]   That's not the point.
[00:03:13.020 --> 00:03:21.260]   The point is, does our emphasis on a truth, a reality, correspond to the
[00:03:21.260 --> 00:03:26.540]   prevalence of the truth and the reality in the scriptures?
[00:03:26.540 --> 00:03:29.460]   Not a frequently used term.
[00:03:29.460 --> 00:03:37.500]   Number two, we are overemphasizing a truth when we are twisting the meaning
[00:03:37.500 --> 00:03:44.620]   of scriptures to make them say a truth that they are not intended to say or
[00:03:44.620 --> 00:03:53.060]   imply. There are many glorious truths in scripture which are not the point of
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:59.340]   dozens of texts in scripture, and we shouldn't force those texts to make a
[00:03:59.340 --> 00:04:03.660]   point that they're not intended to make.
[00:04:04.340 --> 00:04:12.100]   Number three, we are overemphasizing a truth when our emphasis is causing us to
[00:04:12.100 --> 00:04:20.860]   ignore or silence other important biblical and theological truths.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:31.100]   Number four, we are overemphasizing a truth when it is pressing us to distort
[00:04:31.300 --> 00:04:36.740]   other truths so that we can make our point at the expense of other truths by
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:41.780]   forcing them to fit in with our truth when they may not fit in.
[00:04:41.780 --> 00:04:48.620]   If the truth we are emphasizing does not fit with other clear truths in the
[00:04:48.620 --> 00:04:52.540]   Bible, we need to make some adjustments in what we think.
[00:04:53.500 --> 00:05:00.380]   Number five, we are probably overemphasizing a truth when our people,
[00:05:00.380 --> 00:05:08.140]   those who are listening to us, are tempted to use our peculiar terminology
[00:05:08.140 --> 00:05:12.580]   in preference to more biblical terminology.
[00:05:12.580 --> 00:05:19.420]   So, for example, Christian hedonism would be overemphasized if our people are
[00:05:19.420 --> 00:05:26.260]   inclined to constantly use this phrase instead of the biblical language of joy
[00:05:26.260 --> 00:05:31.140]   and contentment and peace and satisfaction and blessedness and reward.
[00:05:31.140 --> 00:05:36.220]   I mean, the Bible has a wonderfully rich vocabulary, and if we shrink it all down
[00:05:36.220 --> 00:05:40.820]   to our little pet phrase, John Piper's little pet phrase of Christian hedonism,
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:45.420]   then we are probably overemphasizing that truth.
[00:05:45.660 --> 00:05:53.020]   Number six, and finally, last one, we are probably overemphasizing a truth if we
[00:05:53.020 --> 00:06:01.940]   ourselves are becoming so fixated on the truth that we are losing our ability to
[00:06:01.940 --> 00:06:06.100]   revel in other glorious truths.
[00:06:06.100 --> 00:06:10.060]   This is a sign of something very dangerous happening.
[00:06:10.580 --> 00:06:17.300]   Namely, we're really loving not the truth of Christian hedonism, we're loving our
[00:06:17.300 --> 00:06:24.300]   possession of the truth of Christian hedonism, which is a deadly reality.
[00:06:24.300 --> 00:06:35.780]   So, at least those six symptoms at least point to an overemphasis of a truth.
[00:06:35.780 --> 00:06:41.620]   And the remedy in a sentence, in general, is to keep the scriptures themselves,
[00:06:41.620 --> 00:06:45.740]   their inspiration, their authority, their true intention, their beauty,
[00:06:45.740 --> 00:06:52.940]   their proportion, keep the scriptures front and center in the formation of all
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:57.100]   of our thinking, all of our willing, and all of our doing.
[00:06:57.100 --> 00:06:59.260]   Amen.
[00:06:59.260 --> 00:07:00.740]   Thank you, Pastor John and Ivan.
