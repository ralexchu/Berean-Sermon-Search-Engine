[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.320]   Hello everybody, apologies that the video was cut short and I want to give a final conclusion
[00:00:11.320 --> 00:00:13.520]   to the sermon.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:19.220]   We left off talking about how there is an opportunity or a fork in the road to reject
[00:00:19.220 --> 00:00:24.400]   or receive the cornerstone, to object or receive the truth.
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:28.560]   And as people who are suffering, that they might have been tempted to all of a sudden
[00:00:28.560 --> 00:00:31.600]   let go of the truth that they hold on to.
[00:00:31.600 --> 00:00:36.680]   Apostle Peter's exhortation is to stand firm in it and in order to exhort them, he gave
[00:00:36.680 --> 00:00:40.760]   a warning by quoting some of these passages in the Old Testament.
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:46.560]   I made the case that there is a warning for us, that if we were to reject this truth,
[00:00:46.560 --> 00:00:49.040]   our hearts would be so hardened.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:54.840]   And likewise, there is a passage in the New Testament that we were turning to.
[00:00:54.840 --> 00:01:00.200]   As we were imagining the religious leaders, the Pharisees and rulers, they were people
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:02.680]   who were well versed in the Scripture.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:07.000]   They were people who learned it from when they were really young.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:11.400]   And they were even maybe leading other people and teaching people in these truths.
[00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:19.000]   But if you turn over to Matthew chapter 11, chapter 21 that is, verses 42 to 44, Jesus
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.320]   said to them, "Have you ever read the Scriptures?"
[00:01:23.320 --> 00:01:24.320]   It's almost sarcastic.
[00:01:24.320 --> 00:01:30.560]   But he says this, "The stone that the builders rejected has become the cornerstone.
[00:01:30.560 --> 00:01:34.120]   This was the Lord's doing, and it is marvelous in our eyes.
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:37.560]   But look at this warning from Jesus Christ.
[00:01:37.560 --> 00:01:42.840]   Therefore I tell you, the kingdom of God will be taken away from you and given to a people,
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:43.840]   producing its fruits.
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   And the one who falls on this stone will be broken to pieces, and when it falls on anyone,
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:52.340]   it will crush him."
[00:01:52.340 --> 00:01:58.640]   So the idea here is that Jesus just finished describing a parable to these Pharisees.
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:04.040]   That the land master had left his workers in the field, and when he sent people to reap
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.680]   the produce of it, they murdered them.
[00:02:06.680 --> 00:02:09.920]   And finally when he sent his son, they killed him too.
[00:02:09.920 --> 00:02:13.720]   Jesus asked this question, "What is the landlord going to do?"
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:17.640]   And they themselves say, "Well surely they will be punished."
[00:02:17.640 --> 00:02:23.140]   Well that idea of "surely they will be punished" is the same idea that's warning us.
[00:02:23.140 --> 00:02:29.700]   If we leave the Gospel message, if we jettison the truth that we say we believe, then God
[00:02:29.700 --> 00:02:32.260]   Himself is going to judge us.
[00:02:32.260 --> 00:02:36.220]   The way that He describes it is the stone that was supposed to be our sanctuary, our
[00:02:36.220 --> 00:02:42.460]   foundation, now becomes the thing that we break upon, the thing that crushes us.
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:48.000]   So that's a clear warning for us, that that fork in the road, for one, leads to a path
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.600]   of sanctuary, and the other leads to a path of destruction.
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:02:56.000]   But the other point that we have to understand, that there's a valuable lesson to learn from
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:02:57.720]   all this.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.200]   We talked about expectation, how when we're disappointed, then we sometimes change our
[00:03:04.200 --> 00:03:05.200]   expectations.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.360]   But many times what we do is when we're disappointed, we actually stop trusting.
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:15.840]   We stop trusting the people, we stop trusting God.
[00:03:15.840 --> 00:03:17.800]   And that can't be.
[00:03:17.800 --> 00:03:22.800]   See for Apostle Peter, he learned a valuable lesson in trusting the Lord.
[00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:28.360]   Do you recall when Jesus Christ was teaching the disciples, when He was telling them, "I'm
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:30.080]   going to leave you."
[00:03:30.080 --> 00:03:32.520]   He was telling them that Christ must suffer.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:36.960]   He was telling them that Christ must go towards this persecution.
[00:03:36.960 --> 00:03:41.320]   And Apostle Peter was one of the first ones who said, "You don't have to do that."
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:44.680]   He was one of the first ones who said, "No, I'll fight for you."
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:48.200]   He actually pulled out his sword and said, "I'll even kill for you."
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:53.000]   That's when Jesus essentially told him, "You don't know what you're talking about, and
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.680]   you need to get behind me."
[00:03:54.680 --> 00:04:00.640]   See this valuable lesson Apostle Peter had to learn, and we need to learn it as well.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:06.960]   That just as Christ, the cornerstone, the real cornerstone, experienced first the suffering,
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.320]   then entered into His glory.
[00:04:09.320 --> 00:04:15.240]   For us too, we likewise, as living stones, must first go through hardship, and then we
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:17.320]   enter into our glory.
[00:04:17.320 --> 00:04:21.920]   So in terms of our expectation, do we expect glory before suffering?
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:28.040]   Let me ask you, do you expect to have all the results before putting in the work?
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:34.040]   Do we expect to have rewards before actually competing or fighting and toiling?
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:37.560]   Do we expect to have victory without there being any battle?
[00:04:37.560 --> 00:04:40.320]   I think many of us probably, we would like to learn.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.240]   We would like to learn the easy way.
[00:04:43.240 --> 00:04:49.040]   We would like to have the fruits of sanctification without necessarily going through the process
[00:04:49.040 --> 00:04:50.040]   of being purified.
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:56.000]   But the truth of the matter is, we, just like our Savior, are going to go through the same
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:04:58.200]   process and timeline.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:02.760]   And that helps us explain and at least grasp what's going on.
[00:05:02.760 --> 00:05:09.520]   That as Christ left an example for His people and disciples to follow, we as those who are
[00:05:09.520 --> 00:05:12.520]   in Christ will follow the same way.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:19.600]   A couple of lasting questions I want to ask is as we think about that, the main question
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:23.440]   for us was, what are our expectations?
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:28.400]   What are we looking forward to in saying, "This is what I anticipate for my life."
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:35.320]   And if we so, were so foolish to just think that as long as I'm God, they'll never suffer.
[00:05:35.320 --> 00:05:39.760]   Or we were so foolish to think as long as I love people and I'm kind to them, then they'll
[00:05:39.760 --> 00:05:42.120]   be kind to me and I won't suffer.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:49.320]   We have to make sure that we adjust our expectations and also to look at the reality of Christ
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:52.840]   and the reality that He set forward for us.
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:58.800]   The other part I want to ask is, the reality is God is doing the work.
[00:05:58.800 --> 00:06:03.480]   God has been preparing a plan and building us up to be a spiritual house.
[00:06:03.480 --> 00:06:09.080]   So God from generations before, God in Christ and God now, even though it doesn't seem like
[00:06:09.080 --> 00:06:12.080]   it, is doing an amazing work of building.
[00:06:12.080 --> 00:06:15.440]   Now there's two builders.
[00:06:15.440 --> 00:06:19.880]   One who's going to continue to build what God has been building.
[00:06:19.880 --> 00:06:22.960]   Are you bought into that plan?
[00:06:22.960 --> 00:06:28.960]   Are you building a kind of house, a spiritual house, a spiritual life where Christ is the
[00:06:28.960 --> 00:06:32.600]   chief cornerstone, where Christ is the foundation?
[00:06:32.600 --> 00:06:38.000]   Or are you building something for your life where Christ is going to get in the way and
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.360]   He's going to be nothing more than a stumbling block to you?
[00:06:41.360 --> 00:06:47.440]   Let's make sure that we build in such a way where He is the cornerstone and our sure foundation.
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.120]   Amen.
