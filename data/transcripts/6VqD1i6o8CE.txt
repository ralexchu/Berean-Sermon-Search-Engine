[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:24.620]   We're going to go ahead and get started with Bible study.
[00:03:24.620 --> 00:03:27.120]   So if you haven't yet, please go ahead and find your seats.
[00:03:27.120 --> 00:03:38.660]   I'll go ahead and pray for us.
[00:03:38.660 --> 00:03:39.460]   Let's pray together.
[00:03:39.460 --> 00:03:45.700]   Father, we thank you for your goodness.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:49.700]   Thank you for your provision, for giving us this time
[00:03:49.700 --> 00:03:51.620]   to study your word.
[00:03:51.620 --> 00:03:53.940]   We thank you so much for your word
[00:03:53.940 --> 00:03:57.020]   and that you've given it to us as a way for us
[00:03:57.020 --> 00:04:00.980]   to learn more about you and to grow in our faith
[00:04:00.980 --> 00:04:03.160]   and in our knowledge.
[00:04:03.160 --> 00:04:07.460]   We thank you for your love and your blessings
[00:04:07.460 --> 00:04:11.460]   towards us, knowing that these are eternal
[00:04:11.460 --> 00:04:14.900]   and what this world has to offer is temporary.
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:18.540]   We pray, Lord, that we wouldn't get so caught up
[00:04:18.540 --> 00:04:21.780]   in the things of this world and the distractions,
[00:04:21.780 --> 00:04:24.620]   but we would set our minds and our gaze
[00:04:24.620 --> 00:04:27.460]   towards the things above and towards you.
[00:04:27.460 --> 00:04:36.380]   So would you give us just this desire and this love to you,
[00:04:36.380 --> 00:04:37.460]   Lord?
[00:04:37.460 --> 00:04:40.180]   We pray for tonight that you'd be honored.
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:45.140]   We pray for this time of praise that you would be praised.
[00:04:45.140 --> 00:04:46.420]   So again, we thank you so much.
[00:04:46.420 --> 00:04:46.920]   We love you.
[00:04:46.920 --> 00:04:48.380]   We pray all this in your name.
[00:04:48.380 --> 00:04:48.880]   Amen.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.720]   Why don't we all stand for a time of praise?
[00:04:50.720 --> 00:04:52.680]   [MUSIC - "BEFORE THE THRONE"]
[00:04:52.680 --> 00:05:12.560]   Before the throne.
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:18.400]   Before the throne of God above, I
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:23.480]   have a strong and perfect plea.
[00:05:23.480 --> 00:05:28.680]   A great high priest whose name is love,
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:33.960]   whoever lives and pleads for me.
[00:05:33.960 --> 00:05:39.360]   My name is graven on his hands.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:44.840]   My name is written on his heart.
[00:05:44.840 --> 00:05:50.200]   I know that while in heaven he stands,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:55.640]   no tongue can bid me thance depart.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:59.080]   No tongue can bid me thance depart.
[00:06:06.240 --> 00:06:09.240]   When Satan tempts.
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:16.080]   When Satan tempts me to despair and tells me
[00:06:16.080 --> 00:06:25.440]   of the guilt within, upward I look and see him there,
[00:06:25.440 --> 00:06:30.840]   who made an end to all my sin.
[00:06:30.840 --> 00:06:38.560]   Because the sinless Savior died, my sinful soul
[00:06:38.560 --> 00:06:41.560]   is counted free.
[00:06:41.560 --> 00:06:52.360]   For God the just is satisfied to look on him and pardon me.
[00:06:52.360 --> 00:06:56.840]   To look on him and pardon me.
[00:06:57.840 --> 00:07:00.320]   [MUSIC - "BEFORE THE THRONE"]
[00:07:00.320 --> 00:07:11.320]   Behold him there, the risen lamb,
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.800]   my perfect spotless righteousness,
[00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:22.280]   the great unchangeable I am.

[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.800]   My soul is purchased by his blood.
[00:07:38.800 --> 00:07:44.200]   My life is hid with Christ on high,
[00:07:44.200 --> 00:07:49.600]   with Christ my Savior and my God.
[00:07:49.600 --> 00:07:55.160]   With Christ my Savior and my God.
[00:07:55.160 --> 00:08:00.560]   One with himself I cannot die.
[00:08:00.560 --> 00:08:06.000]   My soul is purchased by his blood.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:11.400]   My life is hid with Christ on high,
[00:08:11.400 --> 00:08:16.800]   with Christ my Savior and my God.
[00:08:16.800 --> 00:08:21.280]   With Christ my Savior and my God.

[00:09:42.640 --> 00:09:55.120]   Jesus, your name is like honey on my lips,

[00:10:02.560 --> 00:10:10.040]   Your word is a lamp unto my feet.

[00:12:17.160 --> 00:12:19.640]   I love you.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:24.120]   You may be seated.
[00:12:24.120 --> 00:12:33.920]   All right.
[00:12:33.920 --> 00:12:34.880]   Good evening, everyone.
[00:12:34.880 --> 00:12:38.480]   As you get settled in, I just want to make a quick announcement.
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:40.080]   First of all, thank you so much.
[00:12:40.080 --> 00:12:44.560]   As you guys volunteer for parking, you're helping just coordinate the foot traffic and
[00:12:44.560 --> 00:12:47.080]   volunteering for the child care.
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.040]   Again, for the entirety of the session, there's 17 weeks, and so it's really helpful to have
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:56.760]   everybody contribute to that, just sharing in the load and the responsibility.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:13:01.880]   But one question people had was, we're sending out emails for volunteering for cleaning on
[00:13:01.880 --> 00:13:03.000]   Sunday.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.920]   So just as a brief recap, the way that we decided to do it was using a system through
[00:13:07.920 --> 00:13:14.680]   our small groups where we're allocating three small groups and a home group for a month.
[00:13:14.680 --> 00:13:21.840]   Please consider that not just simply as a sign-up request, but what we're doing is actually
[00:13:21.840 --> 00:13:24.240]   seeing that more so as an assignment for your group.
[00:13:24.240 --> 00:13:29.800]   And so if at all possible, please make sure to look at the link and sign up to serve.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:33.560]   And that's primarily because we had so many of you guys help out with Sunday cleaning,
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:38.320]   but now as the facilities get bigger and the use gets expanded, it's quite a big bear.
[00:13:38.320 --> 00:13:43.120]   And each week, there's 20 volunteers that help out in the cleaning efforts.
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.720]   And then what would happen is actually over time, we saw the same people just signing
[00:13:46.720 --> 00:13:48.420]   up month after month.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:53.000]   And so conscientiously, the leadership decided this is a responsibility where we're all using
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:58.760]   the facilities, and it's how widespread it is, it's more helpful to have people who see
[00:13:58.760 --> 00:14:03.120]   the need, people who are using the facility just help out in cleaning it up.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:07.220]   And so we made the conscientious decision to make sure that the responsibility is spread
[00:14:07.220 --> 00:14:08.220]   out through all of us.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.440]   And as many hands make the work light, we want to make sure we're all involved in it,
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:13.440]   okay?
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:15.960]   However, we know that some of you guys are already really involved on Sunday where you
[00:14:15.960 --> 00:14:19.840]   have to come early for something else and stick around later for something else.
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:21.700]   In those cases, obviously, there's exceptions.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:26.640]   If you have any questions at all about volunteering for those things, please shoot me an email.
[00:14:26.640 --> 00:14:30.480]   But again, when it comes to your month and you see that email come out and say, "Hey,
[00:14:30.480 --> 00:14:34.280]   please volunteer," please go ahead and see that as an opportunity just to come together
[00:14:34.280 --> 00:14:39.440]   as a small group and serve and put your name down for that opportunity, okay?
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.800]   Thanks, everyone.
[00:14:41.800 --> 00:14:44.080]   All right.
[00:14:44.080 --> 00:14:45.080]   We're going to...
[00:14:45.080 --> 00:14:50.480]   Let me read for us tonight's passage, and then I'll pray.
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:51.480]   And then I'll go over...
[00:14:51.480 --> 00:14:53.880]   Actually, I'll go over the questions, and then we'll pray together.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:59.400]   So here's 1 Peter 1 verses 20 to 25.
[00:14:59.400 --> 00:15:04.360]   For he was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but has appeared in these last
[00:15:04.360 --> 00:15:10.320]   times for the sake of you who through him are believers in God, who raised him from
[00:15:10.320 --> 00:15:16.440]   the dead and gave him glory so that your faith and hope are in God.
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:22.080]   Since you have in obedience to the truth purified your souls for a sincere love of the brethren,
[00:15:22.080 --> 00:15:24.560]   fervently love one another from the heart.
[00:15:24.560 --> 00:15:29.720]   For you've been born again, not of seed which is perishable, but imperishable.
[00:15:29.720 --> 00:15:32.140]   That is through the living and enduring word of God.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:38.400]   For all flesh is like grass, and all its glory like the flower of grass.
[00:15:38.400 --> 00:15:44.520]   The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:15:44.520 --> 00:15:47.280]   And then this is a word which was preached to you."
[00:15:47.280 --> 00:15:53.280]   So this is the end of chapter 1, and there are a lot of descriptions of what God has
[00:15:53.280 --> 00:15:56.040]   done in chapter 1.
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:16:01.560]   And so tonight we're going to be going over these six verses.
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.420]   Question 1 and 2, you guys know the drill.
[00:16:03.420 --> 00:16:05.840]   You just go over the observation.
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:12.020]   But question number 3 is pretty important for this study.
[00:16:12.020 --> 00:16:13.020]   So let me read it for you.
[00:16:13.020 --> 00:16:19.500]   "What is the relationship between a Christian's life of love and his or her understanding
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.060]   of the word of God?
[00:16:22.060 --> 00:16:28.020]   And can a Christian live in bitterness and unforgiveness?
[00:16:28.020 --> 00:16:29.020]   Is that a possibility?"
[00:16:29.020 --> 00:16:38.140]   Okay, so I want you guys to discuss this, and then at 8.20 we'll get back together for
[00:16:38.140 --> 00:16:39.140]   the teaching portion.
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:43.940]   But let me pray for us, and then we'll get our small group time started.
[00:16:43.940 --> 00:16:53.060]   Lord, we are very thankful for the 19 verses that we've already been able to cover together
[00:16:53.060 --> 00:16:56.540]   with our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:16:56.540 --> 00:17:06.420]   And as we wrap up chapter 1, help us to really trust that Your Word is timeless and that
[00:17:06.420 --> 00:17:10.980]   it does not change, and it is all-powerful.
[00:17:10.980 --> 00:17:17.700]   I pray that You would give us eyes to see things and ears to hear things that You've
[00:17:17.700 --> 00:17:20.180]   intended us to understand.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:27.540]   And I pray, Lord, that we will not be so eager to show off what we know, but rather to glean
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:32.100]   from the text so that we can better apply in our lives.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:39.820]   Lord, we come here with different burdens, different requests, different needs, but we
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:47.060]   do pray that Your Word really would refresh and rejuvenate us tonight and give us just
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:50.660]   really a fruitful time of studying together.
[00:17:50.660 --> 00:17:55.100]   And Lord, that we would leave here longing to apply the things that we've learned.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:17:57.180]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:58.620]   So I'll see you guys at 8.20.

[01:18:37.940 --> 01:18:43.940]   All right, if I can ask you guys to just turn your attentions
[01:18:43.940 --> 01:18:44.620]   to the screens.
[01:18:44.620 --> 01:18:50.980]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll
[01:18:50.980 --> 01:18:53.300]   jump into this meaty passage.
[01:18:53.300 --> 01:19:05.180]   Father, help us not to be just stubborn and nearsighted,
[01:19:05.180 --> 01:19:10.420]   where we only see this as an academic endeavor
[01:19:10.420 --> 01:19:12.980]   to get our theology straight.
[01:19:12.980 --> 01:19:17.340]   But help us, Lord, really to seek to know your heart,
[01:19:17.340 --> 01:19:21.300]   not just for us, but for those who've wronged us,
[01:19:21.300 --> 01:19:24.540]   for those who need you desperately,
[01:19:24.540 --> 01:19:26.780]   that you would move us to love.
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:31.660]   And I pray that you would teach us,
[01:19:31.660 --> 01:19:33.020]   that you would speak to us.
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:36.100]   And we know that love is not something that,
[01:19:36.100 --> 01:19:39.460]   no matter how hard we try, that we can do well.
[01:19:39.460 --> 01:19:43.340]   So this has to be something that you compel us toward.
[01:19:43.340 --> 01:19:47.260]   So we pray for your help as we look in your text.
[01:19:47.260 --> 01:19:49.860]   And Jesus, let me pray.
[01:19:49.860 --> 01:19:52.140]   So this is a quick review.
[01:19:52.140 --> 01:19:55.140]   If you remember verses 10 to 12, it
[01:19:55.140 --> 01:19:57.460]   was like a theologically rich section
[01:19:57.460 --> 01:20:00.980]   where it said this is like a giant salvation baton
[01:20:00.980 --> 01:20:03.740]   pass from the beginning of time.
[01:20:03.740 --> 01:20:05.900]   And then the three imperatives that we
[01:20:05.900 --> 01:20:08.340]   looked at in the previous section
[01:20:08.340 --> 01:20:14.540]   were in light of the fact that this whole human history,
[01:20:14.540 --> 01:20:17.500]   the gospel message was kind of the central point.
[01:20:17.500 --> 01:20:18.940]   This is how we're supposed to live.
[01:20:18.940 --> 01:20:21.140]   We're supposed to fix our hope completely,
[01:20:21.140 --> 01:20:24.100]   be holy in our behavior, and conduct ourselves in fear.
[01:20:24.100 --> 01:20:26.540]   And that was the last two weeks.
[01:20:26.540 --> 01:20:34.580]   Today-- it got cut off.
[01:20:34.580 --> 01:20:40.500]   So this is today's passage, starting for he was foreknown.
[01:20:40.500 --> 01:20:46.180]   And what I did with this is the red,
[01:20:46.180 --> 01:20:49.100]   it's like importing grammatical words.
[01:20:49.100 --> 01:20:50.500]   But in the process of doing this,
[01:20:50.500 --> 01:20:55.620]   I discovered that there is no for in the original language.
[01:20:55.620 --> 01:20:58.100]   The NASB added that.
[01:20:58.100 --> 01:20:59.300]   You guys see that?
[01:20:59.300 --> 01:21:00.420]   So I just crossed that out.
[01:21:00.420 --> 01:21:05.740]   So I crossed that out.
[01:21:05.740 --> 01:21:07.580]   And then my eyes will go to the so that,
[01:21:07.580 --> 01:21:10.100]   my eyes will go to the since, and the for.
[01:21:10.100 --> 01:21:14.500]   So I highlighted those in red.
[01:21:14.500 --> 01:21:19.420]   And then I noticed some like eternality theme in here.
[01:21:19.420 --> 01:21:22.380]   From the beginning of time, enduring, forever.
[01:21:22.380 --> 01:21:24.700]   Hebrews 13.8, Jesus Christ is the same yesterday, today,
[01:21:24.700 --> 01:21:25.380]   and forever.
[01:21:25.380 --> 01:21:28.860]   The eternality theme, I just highlighted all of those
[01:21:28.860 --> 01:21:30.260]   in yellow.
[01:21:30.260 --> 01:21:31.700]   So the top, where it's cut off, it
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:34.860]   says before the foundation of the world, imperishable,
[01:21:34.860 --> 01:21:36.780]   enduring, endures forever.
[01:21:36.780 --> 01:21:39.300]   So it's like a permanent fixture.
[01:21:39.300 --> 01:21:39.900]   So I did that.
[01:21:39.900 --> 01:21:44.300]   So it was like, OK, I know where my eyes can go.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:50.380]   And then the blue bolded was all the stuff that God does.
[01:21:50.380 --> 01:21:54.340]   And I put it all on the kind of the side to make it easier.
[01:21:54.340 --> 01:21:57.940]   So there's a foreknowing, there's an appearing,
[01:21:57.940 --> 01:22:01.020]   there's a raising, there's a glorifying,
[01:22:01.020 --> 01:22:06.620]   and then there's a birthing again, and then a preaching.
[01:22:06.620 --> 01:22:09.300]   Do you guys see how I kind of put that there?
[01:22:09.300 --> 01:22:11.820]   And I bolded it so that I see that there's at least six
[01:22:11.820 --> 01:22:14.700]   things that God does here.
[01:22:14.700 --> 01:22:17.620]   And there's only one thing I'm commanded to do.
[01:22:17.620 --> 01:22:19.540]   And that's right in the middle.
[01:22:19.540 --> 01:22:20.940]   Fervently love.
[01:22:20.940 --> 01:22:24.020]   And the reason I do this is not to make it more appealing
[01:22:24.020 --> 01:22:25.140]   to you artsy folk.
[01:22:25.140 --> 01:22:29.420]   But the reason I do this is so that I can kind of track
[01:22:29.420 --> 01:22:34.700]   like what's commonly or what's emphasized here,
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:37.020]   what's the main point.
[01:22:37.020 --> 01:22:41.780]   And the main point I see is that there's an expected response.
[01:22:41.780 --> 01:22:46.660]   And the main thing is fervently love.
[01:22:46.660 --> 01:22:51.140]   And I noticed I look through the whole thing in the Greek.
[01:22:51.140 --> 01:22:55.540]   That's I think the only command in this section.
[01:22:55.540 --> 01:22:57.500]   There are all these things that were done.
[01:22:57.500 --> 01:23:02.940]   And the only command that there is for me is fervently love.
[01:23:02.940 --> 01:23:06.740]   And it's interesting that's in the passive.
[01:23:06.740 --> 01:23:11.020]   Usually a passive means it's a response.
[01:23:11.020 --> 01:23:13.900]   It's not something I am conjuring up.
[01:23:13.900 --> 01:23:15.500]   So I first do that.
[01:23:15.500 --> 01:23:20.940]   And I'm at the end of the chapter.
[01:23:20.940 --> 01:23:24.380]   But it seemed like the last five weeks there was so much
[01:23:24.380 --> 01:23:26.300]   of God doing stuff.
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:29.060]   So I just made a list.
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:30.180]   Okay.
[01:23:30.180 --> 01:23:33.340]   So this is all from just chapter one,
[01:23:33.340 --> 01:23:37.700]   things that mention the power of God and the will of God.
[01:23:37.700 --> 01:23:42.340]   And if you notice the purple, I'm not comfortable
[01:23:42.340 --> 01:23:44.300]   with it emotionally.
[01:23:44.300 --> 01:23:46.940]   But there's almost a foreknowing aspect of God.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:50.140]   There's almost a predicting and ordaining.
[01:23:50.140 --> 01:23:51.780]   The emotional part that I'm not comfortable
[01:23:51.780 --> 01:23:53.860]   with is then am I a robot, right?
[01:23:53.860 --> 01:23:55.380]   Does he just force me to do stuff?
[01:23:55.380 --> 01:23:56.500]   Does he twist my arm?
[01:23:56.500 --> 01:23:58.500]   Because emotionally that's what it feels like.
[01:23:58.500 --> 01:24:01.180]   But I notice in the scripture it's very --
[01:24:01.180 --> 01:24:04.580]   it seems like God is in control of everything.
[01:24:04.580 --> 01:24:06.060]   Do you notice that?
[01:24:06.060 --> 01:24:07.220]   And we don't like God being in control
[01:24:07.220 --> 01:24:09.540]   of everything at times, right?
[01:24:09.540 --> 01:24:11.780]   It makes us feel like helpless.
[01:24:11.780 --> 01:24:15.340]   Okay. And then I noticed that there's a holifying,
[01:24:15.340 --> 01:24:17.980]   a sanctifying, like a changing.
[01:24:17.980 --> 01:24:21.940]   And I just did those in red.
[01:24:21.940 --> 01:24:22.940]   Okay. He sanctifies.
[01:24:22.940 --> 01:24:23.900]   He causes a rebirth.
[01:24:23.900 --> 01:24:26.980]   He redeems, causes a rebirth again.
[01:24:26.980 --> 01:24:29.460]   And then Jesus being raised from the dead, I noticed, oh,
[01:24:29.460 --> 01:24:31.460]   it's mentioned twice.
[01:24:31.460 --> 01:24:35.100]   Is that significant to my salvation?
[01:24:35.100 --> 01:24:38.260]   So I just listed all the stuff that God does.
[01:24:38.260 --> 01:24:40.500]   And there's only like four imperatives in here, right?
[01:24:40.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   There's all of this stuff that God does.
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:47.780]   And what am I supposed to do with all of this?
[01:24:47.780 --> 01:24:51.940]   So it's helpful at the end of every chapter just
[01:24:51.940 --> 01:24:54.340]   to do a little recap.
[01:24:54.340 --> 01:24:58.260]   Because verse 23 said, "You have been born again,
[01:24:58.260 --> 01:25:00.580]   not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible,
[01:25:00.580 --> 01:25:02.460]   through the living, enduring word of God."
[01:25:02.460 --> 01:25:06.700]   Right? And your faith and your hope are in who?
[01:25:06.700 --> 01:25:10.300]   In God. So this is the God we serve.
[01:25:10.300 --> 01:25:12.100]   He does it all.
[01:25:12.100 --> 01:25:15.100]   And my faith is in Him.
[01:25:15.100 --> 01:25:18.780]   Not in me. Not in Pastor Peter.
[01:25:18.780 --> 01:25:23.100]   Okay? My hope is not in Berean Community Church
[01:25:23.100 --> 01:25:24.620]   or a Christian government.
[01:25:24.620 --> 01:25:27.380]   No. It's in Him.
[01:25:27.380 --> 01:25:29.780]   And my hope is also in Him.
[01:25:29.780 --> 01:25:31.540]   And He does all this stuff.
[01:25:31.540 --> 01:25:34.340]   Okay? So I noticed that with my eyes.
[01:25:34.340 --> 01:25:36.900]   Verse 22.
[01:25:36.900 --> 01:25:39.820]   So when I was trying to memorize chapter one,
[01:25:39.820 --> 01:25:42.460]   this was like October, November.
[01:25:42.460 --> 01:25:46.380]   Verse 22 was so odd for me.
[01:25:46.380 --> 01:25:47.980]   Because it was all this theology,
[01:25:47.980 --> 01:25:49.740]   and then there's just this, first of all,
[01:25:49.740 --> 01:25:52.220]   the wording is strange. You guys notice?
[01:25:52.220 --> 01:25:54.660]   Since you have an obedience to the truth, right?
[01:25:54.660 --> 01:25:57.780]   Purify your souls for a love without hypocrisy.
[01:25:57.780 --> 01:25:59.180]   They go, "What?" Right?
[01:25:59.180 --> 01:26:00.620]   Fervently love one another from the heart.
[01:26:00.620 --> 01:26:03.660]   So I just got tripped over this verse.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.740]   And I realized, rightly so,
[01:26:06.740 --> 01:26:11.020]   there's a lot of conditional clauses in verse 22.
[01:26:11.020 --> 01:26:13.580]   Okay?
[01:26:13.580 --> 01:26:17.020]   So the translations are like grammatically funky.
[01:26:17.020 --> 01:26:20.980]   All of them. A little bit. Okay?
[01:26:20.980 --> 01:26:24.300]   The purification.
[01:26:24.300 --> 01:26:27.260]   So the perfect tense of the participle
[01:26:27.260 --> 01:26:30.220]   signifies a past action
[01:26:30.220 --> 01:26:33.300]   that has ongoing consequences.
[01:26:33.300 --> 01:26:35.980]   So you were purified.
[01:26:35.980 --> 01:26:38.180]   And so things are going to happen
[01:26:38.180 --> 01:26:40.700]   because you were purified.
[01:26:40.700 --> 01:26:45.860]   All right? That's the thrust of the tense of the participle.
[01:26:45.860 --> 01:26:50.220]   And if I'm paraphrasing this verse,
[01:26:50.220 --> 01:26:54.620]   the result of my conversion
[01:26:54.620 --> 01:26:57.860]   is that I have love for my fellow Christian.
[01:26:57.860 --> 01:27:00.900]   That's a byproduct.
[01:27:00.900 --> 01:27:03.300]   You guys following that?
[01:27:03.300 --> 01:27:05.380]   I cannot say I've been purified
[01:27:05.380 --> 01:27:07.900]   and not love the fellow Christian.
[01:27:07.900 --> 01:27:09.140]   Okay?
[01:27:09.140 --> 01:27:13.060]   So there's a purification
[01:27:13.060 --> 01:27:16.340]   that's done something to me in the past
[01:27:16.340 --> 01:27:19.580]   that has ramifications to the now.
[01:27:19.580 --> 01:27:24.500]   My result is I'm a loving person.
[01:27:24.500 --> 01:27:29.820]   And the command is to use this new love that's in me
[01:27:29.820 --> 01:27:31.940]   and go all out.
[01:27:31.940 --> 01:27:37.500]   You guys get that?
[01:27:37.500 --> 01:27:41.180]   And so one of the questions I came up with is,
[01:27:41.180 --> 01:27:44.020]   what's the difference between love and fervent love?
[01:27:44.020 --> 01:27:46.620]   It's not used that often, right?
[01:27:46.620 --> 01:27:49.340]   We fervently love because he fervently loved us.
[01:27:49.340 --> 01:27:52.260]   That's not what 1 John 4:19 says.
[01:27:52.260 --> 01:27:53.100]   Right?
[01:27:53.100 --> 01:27:55.740]   Beloved, let us fervently love one another.
[01:27:55.740 --> 01:27:57.860]   That's not what it says either.
[01:27:57.860 --> 01:27:59.300]   Okay? It just says love.
[01:27:59.300 --> 01:28:02.700]   But why does it say fervently twice in 1 Peter?
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:06.260]   It comes up again in chapter 4.
[01:28:06.260 --> 01:28:11.900]   So I looked at the word in the Greek for this is ektinos.
[01:28:11.900 --> 01:28:15.460]   So that's actually a physiological term.
[01:28:15.460 --> 01:28:18.340]   It means to stretch to the furthest limit
[01:28:18.340 --> 01:28:21.100]   of a muscle's capacity.
[01:28:21.100 --> 01:28:23.740]   Go all out.
[01:28:23.740 --> 01:28:26.420]   I'm not flexible.
[01:28:26.420 --> 01:28:29.940]   I am like, I don't have dexterity in my body.
[01:28:29.940 --> 01:28:32.900]   You tell me to do the splits, I'm doing them right now.
[01:28:32.900 --> 01:28:34.140]   Okay?
[01:28:34.140 --> 01:28:37.940]   But I know that I can train that.
[01:28:37.940 --> 01:28:40.220]   So with my limited capacity right now,
[01:28:40.220 --> 01:28:46.820]   I'm gonna try to strain to love.
[01:28:46.820 --> 01:28:51.060]   And that fervent love one day will continue to grow
[01:28:51.060 --> 01:28:52.820]   as I am being stretched.
[01:28:52.820 --> 01:28:54.820]   That's the imagery.
[01:28:54.820 --> 01:28:56.580]   You guys get that?
[01:28:56.580 --> 01:29:01.140]   And it comes out again in 1 Peter 4.8.
[01:29:01.140 --> 01:29:09.020]   Because when a lot of, let's say there's chaos,
[01:29:09.020 --> 01:29:13.060]   the government forces a mandate or forces like a vaccine,
[01:29:13.060 --> 01:29:15.700]   let's say.
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:17.900]   Half the people think it's good.
[01:29:17.900 --> 01:29:20.860]   Half the people think it's bad.
[01:29:20.860 --> 01:29:23.740]   And they start arguing.
[01:29:23.740 --> 01:29:26.740]   Blame shifts start to happen.
[01:29:26.740 --> 01:29:30.300]   Right? People start to get divided.
[01:29:30.300 --> 01:29:34.300]   Not because they don't love each other,
[01:29:34.300 --> 01:29:36.220]   but because something external happened
[01:29:36.220 --> 01:29:39.180]   to cause some chaos and division.
[01:29:39.180 --> 01:29:41.860]   So when things go awry,
[01:29:41.860 --> 01:29:45.700]   human beings have a tendency to hate on each other
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:47.180]   and to riot.
[01:29:47.180 --> 01:29:49.540]   I'm not talking just like what we understand as riot,
[01:29:49.540 --> 01:29:52.300]   but just things just go crazy.
[01:29:52.300 --> 01:29:55.220]   Fervently love in that situation.
[01:29:55.220 --> 01:29:57.340]   This is the exhortation.
[01:29:57.340 --> 01:30:00.700]   Okay?
[01:30:00.700 --> 01:30:12.420]   So here's a question that I want to ask.
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:20.100]   Do we love people even if they don't deserve it?
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:22.820]   Nod your heads yes or no, or shake your heads.
[01:30:22.820 --> 01:30:29.260]   If they don't deserve it, should we love them?
[01:30:29.260 --> 01:30:30.180]   Okay, I don't see any way.
[01:30:30.180 --> 01:30:36.740]   So you're either doing this or you're like, okay.
[01:30:36.740 --> 01:30:41.380]   How about if they've wronged you?
[01:30:41.380 --> 01:30:44.260]   Badly.
[01:30:44.260 --> 01:30:49.940]   Do you love them?
[01:30:49.940 --> 01:30:53.260]   What if they've caused you irreparable harm?
[01:30:53.260 --> 01:30:56.220]   Do you love them?
[01:30:56.220 --> 01:30:58.140]   It takes all my energy just not to hate them
[01:30:58.140 --> 01:30:59.780]   or to be angry with them.
[01:30:59.780 --> 01:31:01.940]   Okay?
[01:31:01.940 --> 01:31:04.260]   So this is an important question here.
[01:31:04.260 --> 01:31:10.060]   Can a Christian live in unforgiveness and bitterness?
[01:31:10.060 --> 01:31:13.420]   So I'm going to do a quick look through
[01:31:13.420 --> 01:31:17.180]   how the love of God changes us
[01:31:17.180 --> 01:31:22.340]   and how that affects our love going outward, right?
[01:31:22.340 --> 01:31:25.340]   So here's a fruit of the flesh.
[01:31:25.340 --> 01:31:27.820]   There's enmity, strife, jealousy, outbursts of anger,
[01:31:27.820 --> 01:31:30.700]   disputes, dissensions, factions.
[01:31:30.700 --> 01:31:33.340]   And here's a strong verse, okay?
[01:31:33.340 --> 01:31:37.100]   Those who practice such things
[01:31:37.100 --> 01:31:43.860]   will not inherit the kingdom of God.
[01:31:43.860 --> 01:31:46.820]   So let me clarify one thing.
[01:31:46.820 --> 01:31:49.500]   If you have a fit of anger,
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:54.020]   that doesn't mean God's going to send you to hell, okay?
[01:31:54.020 --> 01:31:58.140]   The only sin that is deserving of hell --
[01:31:58.140 --> 01:31:59.380]   okay, let me get this.
[01:31:59.380 --> 01:32:01.780]   The only sin that you will not be forgiven of
[01:32:01.780 --> 01:32:03.780]   is a rejection of Christ.
[01:32:03.780 --> 01:32:05.980]   You guys follow that?
[01:32:05.980 --> 01:32:07.580]   You guys understand that?
[01:32:07.580 --> 01:32:09.340]   So if you wrestle with anger,
[01:32:09.340 --> 01:32:11.060]   that doesn't mean you're going to immediately,
[01:32:11.060 --> 01:32:14.340]   like, not inherit the kingdom of God.
[01:32:14.340 --> 01:32:16.300]   But what this is talking about is
[01:32:16.300 --> 01:32:22.060]   a man unchanged by God looks like that.
[01:32:22.060 --> 01:32:24.620]   But a man changed by God for the fruit of the Spirit
[01:32:24.620 --> 01:32:25.700]   is love, joy, peace, patience,
[01:32:25.700 --> 01:32:28.820]   piety, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control, right?
[01:32:28.820 --> 01:32:31.140]   But what's the first one that comes out?
[01:32:31.140 --> 01:32:33.860]   Is love.
[01:32:33.860 --> 01:32:41.500]   So if you were to grab me, okay,
[01:32:41.500 --> 01:32:47.380]   and to throw me into an ocean,
[01:32:47.380 --> 01:32:50.260]   I'm going to ask you to do a couple things.
[01:32:50.260 --> 01:32:55.340]   I'm going to ask you to first let me remove my phone,
[01:32:55.340 --> 01:32:59.460]   my wallet, and my keys.
[01:32:59.460 --> 01:33:00.500]   And if I'm wearing something nice,
[01:33:00.500 --> 01:33:01.260]   maybe I'll ask you to do that.
[01:33:01.260 --> 01:33:02.900]   Okay, my shoes, too.
[01:33:02.900 --> 01:33:07.300]   Why?
[01:33:07.300 --> 01:33:08.940]   Justin, you need to pick me up.
[01:33:08.940 --> 01:33:11.220]   Jeremy Wong, he grabbed me and picked me up.
[01:33:11.220 --> 01:33:12.500]   Some of you guys who are buff were like,
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:13.540]   "How come he's not naming me?"
[01:33:13.540 --> 01:33:15.300]   I'm just, okay.
[01:33:15.300 --> 01:33:20.380]   But let's say our church guys decide to grab me, okay?
[01:33:20.380 --> 01:33:23.260]   Throw me into the ocean.
[01:33:23.260 --> 01:33:28.340]   Can I get into the ocean and come out be dry?
[01:33:28.340 --> 01:33:30.140]   Yes or no?
[01:33:30.140 --> 01:33:32.900]   Impossible.
[01:33:32.900 --> 01:33:36.940]   If a tsunami is coming at me,
[01:33:36.940 --> 01:33:40.660]   I'm not only going to get wet, I might die.
[01:33:40.660 --> 01:33:44.900]   It is impossible for me to be hit by a tsunami
[01:33:44.900 --> 01:33:49.380]   and come out not wet.
[01:33:49.380 --> 01:33:51.700]   You guys following this?
[01:33:51.700 --> 01:33:56.460]   All of the stuff in chapter 1 that God has done
[01:33:56.460 --> 01:34:01.260]   is a very powerful force.
[01:34:01.260 --> 01:34:03.980]   He, from the beginning of time, is unchanging.
[01:34:03.980 --> 01:34:05.460]   He, from the very beginning of time,
[01:34:05.460 --> 01:34:07.860]   has orchestrated, ordained everything.
[01:34:07.860 --> 01:34:10.260]   He protects your salvation.
[01:34:10.260 --> 01:34:12.700]   He causes rebirth.
[01:34:12.700 --> 01:34:13.860]   He saves.
[01:34:13.860 --> 01:34:17.700]   He raises people from the dead.
[01:34:17.700 --> 01:34:23.620]   So for you to say, "I've gotten immersed into this God,"
[01:34:23.620 --> 01:34:30.300]   and to come out dry is impossible.
[01:34:30.300 --> 01:34:33.660]   So I'm going to say something that might
[01:34:33.660 --> 01:34:37.700]   discomfort you a little bit.
[01:34:37.700 --> 01:34:44.660]   It is impossible for a Christian
[01:34:44.660 --> 01:34:49.060]   to live in unforgiveness and bitterness.
[01:34:49.060 --> 01:34:57.020]   Does this make sense?
[01:34:57.020 --> 01:35:04.260]   It is impossible for a Christian
[01:35:04.260 --> 01:35:10.540]   to live harboring a forever grudge,
[01:35:10.540 --> 01:35:15.300]   bitterness, and unforgiveness.
[01:35:15.300 --> 01:35:18.260]   Najaz, if you understand this,
[01:35:18.260 --> 01:35:20.260]   I guarantee you, you will not be able
[01:35:20.260 --> 01:35:24.220]   to argue that biblically against that.
[01:35:24.220 --> 01:35:26.660]   You guys follow that?
[01:35:26.660 --> 01:35:29.220]   I'm going to repeat it one more time.
[01:35:29.220 --> 01:35:33.220]   If you are a Christian,
[01:35:33.220 --> 01:35:39.820]   you cannot, it's impossible for you not to forgive,
[01:35:39.820 --> 01:35:44.460]   not to live in bitterness,
[01:35:44.460 --> 01:35:47.860]   and say, "I will never forgive you."
[01:35:47.860 --> 01:35:49.900]   You guys understand this?
[01:35:49.900 --> 01:35:52.180]   Because God has changed you.
[01:35:52.180 --> 01:35:55.340]   It's less, it's more possible that you go into an ocean
[01:35:55.340 --> 01:35:59.380]   and come out dry than for you to be a Christian
[01:35:59.380 --> 01:36:02.260]   and not be able to forgive.
[01:36:02.260 --> 01:36:05.580]   I don't care what's been done.
[01:36:05.580 --> 01:36:07.660]   Now, if you wrestle with the emotions
[01:36:07.660 --> 01:36:10.820]   and the ups and downs, that's normal.
[01:36:10.820 --> 01:36:12.100]   That's sanctification.
[01:36:12.100 --> 01:36:15.300]   That's part of the sanctification.
[01:36:15.300 --> 01:36:18.220]   But you cannot be a Christian
[01:36:18.220 --> 01:36:24.580]   and go to the grave with grudges.
[01:36:24.580 --> 01:36:29.500]   God will not let that happen.
[01:36:29.500 --> 01:36:33.100]   You guys understand that?
[01:36:33.100 --> 01:36:35.420]   1 John 4, 7, and 8.
[01:36:35.420 --> 01:36:37.020]   "Beloved, let us love one another,
[01:36:37.020 --> 01:36:38.540]   "for love is from God, and everyone who loves
[01:36:38.540 --> 01:36:40.940]   "is born a God and knows God.
[01:36:40.940 --> 01:36:44.460]   "The one who does not love does not know God,
[01:36:44.460 --> 01:36:46.140]   "for God is love."
[01:36:46.140 --> 01:36:47.740]   Ooh, that's strong words.
[01:36:47.740 --> 01:36:49.980]   I don't like 1 John, because 1 John makes everything
[01:36:49.980 --> 01:36:51.900]   way black, way white.
[01:36:51.900 --> 01:36:53.940]   Right?
[01:36:53.940 --> 01:36:55.300]   Okay?
[01:36:55.300 --> 01:36:57.380]   You are a liar. I'm a liar.
[01:36:57.380 --> 01:36:59.100]   It cuts you.
[01:36:59.100 --> 01:37:01.060]   But that's what it says.
[01:37:01.060 --> 01:37:03.420]   1 John 4, 19 and 21.
[01:37:03.420 --> 01:37:04.620]   We love.
[01:37:04.620 --> 01:37:05.740]   Not we should love.
[01:37:05.740 --> 01:37:07.460]   We love.
[01:37:07.460 --> 01:37:09.260]   Because why?
[01:37:09.260 --> 01:37:12.540]   This ocean of love has drenched us.
[01:37:12.540 --> 01:37:13.740]   Okay?
[01:37:13.740 --> 01:37:16.900]   If someone says, "I love God,"
[01:37:16.900 --> 01:37:18.940]   usually they say it like that.
[01:37:18.940 --> 01:37:20.740]   No one says, "I love God," right?
[01:37:20.740 --> 01:37:22.820]   It's like, "Oh, I love God,"
[01:37:22.820 --> 01:37:25.260]   and hates his brother.
[01:37:25.260 --> 01:37:28.660]   You liar.
[01:37:28.660 --> 01:37:30.540]   "For the one who does not love his brother
[01:37:30.540 --> 01:37:33.740]   "whom he has seen cannot love God
[01:37:33.740 --> 01:37:34.900]   "whom he has not seen."
[01:37:34.900 --> 01:37:38.180]   Impossible is another word to say that.
[01:37:38.180 --> 01:37:39.460]   And this is the command we have from him,
[01:37:39.460 --> 01:37:44.460]   that the one who loves God should love his brother also.
[01:37:44.460 --> 01:37:51.980]   So,
[01:37:51.980 --> 01:37:54.500]   we are commanded to love.
[01:37:54.500 --> 01:37:56.420]   We are enabled to love.
[01:37:56.420 --> 01:37:58.980]   Make sense?
[01:37:58.980 --> 01:38:02.020]   We will wrestle with emotion.
[01:38:02.020 --> 01:38:05.300]   And scars, even when they heal, are tender.
[01:38:05.300 --> 01:38:07.060]   True or false?
[01:38:07.060 --> 01:38:07.700]   Yeah.
[01:38:07.700 --> 01:38:09.820]   But God empowers you to love.
[01:38:09.820 --> 01:38:12.220]   Because what's the first fruit of the Spirit?
[01:38:12.220 --> 01:38:13.220]   Love.
[01:38:13.220 --> 01:38:15.900]   It's like, "Goal!"
[01:38:15.900 --> 01:38:17.900]   The next day, I'm like, "Lord,
[01:38:17.900 --> 01:38:21.420]   "that guy, he did this and this and that to me, but...
[01:38:21.420 --> 01:38:23.340]   "Oh, you want me to love him?
[01:38:23.340 --> 01:38:26.340]   "Ah, okay."
[01:38:26.540 --> 01:38:30.260]   A true Christian is always willing
[01:38:30.260 --> 01:38:32.340]   to make the effort.
[01:38:32.340 --> 01:38:33.780]   Okay?
[01:38:33.780 --> 01:38:35.540]   So,
[01:38:35.540 --> 01:38:37.300]   when I hear this verse, I think of like,
[01:38:37.300 --> 01:38:42.300]   "Okay, what does it mean then?"
[01:38:42.300 --> 01:38:44.740]   Romans 12, 18, "If possible, so far as it depends on you,
[01:38:44.740 --> 01:38:47.700]   "be at peace with all men."
[01:38:47.700 --> 01:38:50.380]   If you've had a falling out with somebody,
[01:38:50.380 --> 01:38:52.580]   as a Christian,
[01:38:52.580 --> 01:38:54.660]   you will
[01:38:54.660 --> 01:38:58.540]   want to pursue him or her in due time.
[01:38:58.540 --> 01:39:03.740]   You guys get that?
[01:39:03.740 --> 01:39:06.140]   Ephesians 2, 8-10,
[01:39:06.140 --> 01:39:07.940]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[01:39:07.940 --> 01:39:09.940]   "and that not of yourself, but as a gift of God,
[01:39:09.940 --> 01:39:12.060]   "not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[01:39:12.060 --> 01:39:15.620]   And that's a verse that everyone memorizes as a kid.
[01:39:15.620 --> 01:39:17.060]   We are his workmanship,
[01:39:17.060 --> 01:39:20.260]   and we have a mighty potter
[01:39:20.260 --> 01:39:22.220]   who changes hearts, right?
[01:39:22.220 --> 01:39:24.020]   Created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[01:39:24.020 --> 01:39:26.420]   which God prepared beforehand,
[01:39:26.420 --> 01:39:27.420]   so that we would walk in them.
[01:39:27.420 --> 01:39:32.780]   Here's the eternality theme again.
[01:39:32.780 --> 01:39:34.660]   We pursue,
[01:39:34.660 --> 01:39:38.220]   because that's just a byproduct of knowing God,
[01:39:38.220 --> 01:39:40.900]   in due time.
[01:39:40.900 --> 01:39:44.860]   Here's a passage that I want to read for you.
[01:39:44.860 --> 01:39:47.700]   It's lengthy, so I just kind of cut it up.
[01:39:47.700 --> 01:39:51.500]   This is the parable of the unforgiving servant.
[01:39:51.500 --> 01:39:52.700]   "Then Peter came and said to him,
[01:39:52.700 --> 01:39:55.260]   "'Lord, how often shall my brother sin against me?'
[01:39:55.260 --> 01:39:57.980]   "And I forgive him up to seven times.
[01:39:57.980 --> 01:40:00.220]   "Jesus said to him, 'I do not say to you up to seven times,
[01:40:00.220 --> 01:40:02.700]   "'but up to seventy times seven.
[01:40:02.700 --> 01:40:04.740]   "'For this reason, the kingdom of heaven
[01:40:04.740 --> 01:40:06.340]   "'may be compared to a king
[01:40:06.340 --> 01:40:08.020]   "'who wishes to settle accounts with his slaves.'"
[01:40:08.020 --> 01:40:11.900]   So this is not a perfect, detailed story,
[01:40:11.900 --> 01:40:17.980]   but it's a parable to explain a heart of something.
[01:40:17.980 --> 01:40:21.700]   So there's a slave who had an unpayable debt,
[01:40:21.700 --> 01:40:23.060]   and then the master forgives him, right?
[01:40:23.060 --> 01:40:24.660]   Okay, so verse 27,
[01:40:24.660 --> 01:40:27.260]   "And the lord of that slave felt compassion
[01:40:27.260 --> 01:40:29.620]   "and released him and forgave him the debt.
[01:40:29.620 --> 01:40:32.100]   "But that slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves
[01:40:32.100 --> 01:40:33.660]   "who owed him a hundred denarii.
[01:40:33.660 --> 01:40:35.380]   "He seized and began to chuck him, saying,
[01:40:35.380 --> 01:40:37.100]   "'Pay back what you owe!'
[01:40:37.100 --> 01:40:38.500]   "So his fellow slave fell to the ground
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:39.500]   "and began to plead with him, saying,
[01:40:39.500 --> 01:40:41.620]   "'Have patience with me, and I will repay you.'"
[01:40:41.620 --> 01:40:44.460]   It's the same thing that guy said.
[01:40:44.460 --> 01:40:45.300]   Okay, verse 33,
[01:40:45.300 --> 01:40:47.580]   "Should you not also have had mercy on your fellow slave
[01:40:47.580 --> 01:40:49.780]   "in the same way that I had mercy on you?
[01:40:49.780 --> 01:40:52.460]   "And his lord moved with anger,
[01:40:52.460 --> 01:40:53.580]   "handed him over to the torturers
[01:40:53.580 --> 01:40:56.340]   "until he should repay all that was owed him.
[01:40:56.340 --> 01:40:58.540]   "My heavenly father will also do the same to you
[01:40:58.540 --> 01:41:01.260]   "if each of you does not forgive his brother from your heart."
[01:41:01.260 --> 01:41:02.300]   This isn't talking about,
[01:41:02.300 --> 01:41:05.700]   well, if you, in the event you are a Christian,
[01:41:05.700 --> 01:41:07.940]   but you can't forgive this person, you will go to hell.
[01:41:07.940 --> 01:41:09.900]   That's not what this is saying.
[01:41:09.900 --> 01:41:11.020]   This is saying it,
[01:41:11.020 --> 01:41:13.380]   if you really understand what you were forgiven from,
[01:41:13.380 --> 01:41:14.780]   you cannot but forgive.
[01:41:16.620 --> 01:41:19.100]   So, in other words,
[01:41:19.100 --> 01:41:22.420]   a Christian cannot have a victim mentality.
[01:41:22.420 --> 01:41:25.460]   Not just if you understand this.
[01:41:25.460 --> 01:41:30.300]   A Christian cannot have a victim mentality.
[01:41:30.300 --> 01:41:31.900]   And there are people who have victim mentalities
[01:41:31.900 --> 01:41:33.060]   in the churches.
[01:41:33.060 --> 01:41:35.860]   It's always someone else's fault, right?
[01:41:35.860 --> 01:41:37.860]   A Christian cannot have a victim mentality.
[01:41:37.860 --> 01:41:41.780]   A Christian cannot live in unforgiveness.
[01:41:41.780 --> 01:41:44.860]   All right, that's what the text is saying.
[01:41:45.820 --> 01:41:48.580]   (pages rustling)
[01:41:48.580 --> 01:41:49.420]   Oop.
[01:41:49.420 --> 01:41:54.620]   And I wanna just have us wrestle with this.
[01:41:54.620 --> 01:41:56.500]   We're studying this theology in 1 Peter
[01:41:56.500 --> 01:41:58.140]   and all of this stuff that God's done.
[01:41:58.140 --> 01:42:01.220]   We've been born again, we've been purified,
[01:42:01.220 --> 01:42:03.420]   so that we've been obedient to the truth.
[01:42:03.420 --> 01:42:05.500]   We are protected by the power of God through faith
[01:42:05.500 --> 01:42:07.660]   for our salvation, ready to be revealed in the last time.
[01:42:07.660 --> 01:42:11.220]   We rejoice greatly, even though we suffer for a little while.
[01:42:11.220 --> 01:42:15.060]   But the point of this is fervently love.
[01:42:15.060 --> 01:42:20.380]   And that's that heartbeat of the passage that we read today.
[01:42:20.380 --> 01:42:23.020]   And I wanna just read, Matthew 24 came to my mind,
[01:42:23.020 --> 01:42:24.780]   and I wanna just read this for you.
[01:42:24.780 --> 01:42:28.180]   This is describing the end of times.
[01:42:28.180 --> 01:42:33.540]   "You will be hearing of wars and rumors of wars.
[01:42:33.540 --> 01:42:35.780]   "See that you are not frightened,
[01:42:35.780 --> 01:42:37.340]   "for those things must take place,
[01:42:37.340 --> 01:42:39.580]   "but that is not yet the end.
[01:42:39.580 --> 01:42:41.980]   "For nation will rise against nation,
[01:42:41.980 --> 01:42:43.580]   "and kingdom against kingdom,
[01:42:43.580 --> 01:42:47.900]   "and in various places there will be famines and earthquakes
[01:42:47.900 --> 01:42:50.740]   "and maybe hail," like yesterday, okay?
[01:42:50.740 --> 01:42:53.900]   "But all these things are merely
[01:42:53.900 --> 01:42:57.020]   "the beginning of birth pains.
[01:42:57.020 --> 01:42:59.940]   "Then they will deliver you to tribulation and will kill you
[01:42:59.940 --> 01:43:03.060]   "and you will be hated by all nations because of my name.
[01:43:03.060 --> 01:43:05.380]   "At that time, many will fall away and betray one another
[01:43:05.380 --> 01:43:06.980]   "and hate one another.
[01:43:06.980 --> 01:43:09.980]   "Many false prophets will arise and will mislead many."
[01:43:09.980 --> 01:43:13.820]   And I think one of the false prophets that's around is,
[01:43:13.820 --> 01:43:16.300]   like,
[01:43:16.300 --> 01:43:21.140]   I gotta be careful here.
[01:43:21.140 --> 01:43:26.420]   I really don't like the thing called deconstruction.
[01:43:26.420 --> 01:43:28.820]   I really don't like it.
[01:43:28.820 --> 01:43:33.660]   'Cause you know what's gonna happen when you deconstruct?
[01:43:33.660 --> 01:43:35.100]   You discover you're a sinner.
[01:43:36.020 --> 01:43:38.260]   And that everyone else around you is a sinner.
[01:43:38.260 --> 01:43:42.500]   And everyone else around you is a lot worse
[01:43:42.500 --> 01:43:44.500]   than you had ever imagined him to be.
[01:43:44.500 --> 01:43:45.340]   And you're a lot worse
[01:43:45.340 --> 01:43:47.340]   than you've ever imagined yourself to be.
[01:43:47.340 --> 01:43:51.580]   And to say that, God loves you anyway,
[01:43:51.580 --> 01:43:54.220]   and you just reject his standard of holiness
[01:43:54.220 --> 01:43:55.660]   and you just live however you please,
[01:43:55.660 --> 01:43:58.060]   that's the teachings of many false prophets.
[01:43:58.060 --> 01:44:03.620]   You guys understand?
[01:44:04.180 --> 01:44:07.180]   (audience laughing)
[01:44:07.180 --> 01:44:10.980]   Because lawlessness is increased,
[01:44:10.980 --> 01:44:13.580]   most people's love will grow cold.
[01:44:13.580 --> 01:44:17.060]   And we see that in today's churches, right?
[01:44:17.060 --> 01:44:23.100]   But the one who endures to the end by the power of God,
[01:44:23.100 --> 01:44:24.780]   who are protected by the power of God through salvation
[01:44:24.780 --> 01:44:27.860]   for a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time,
[01:44:27.860 --> 01:44:31.180]   you will be enduring, okay?
[01:44:33.380 --> 01:44:35.500]   The gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[01:44:35.500 --> 01:44:37.740]   in the whole world as a testimony to all the nations
[01:44:37.740 --> 01:44:38.780]   and the end will come.
[01:44:38.780 --> 01:44:45.100]   So the point of tonight is, have you met this God?
[01:44:45.100 --> 01:44:48.100]   And if you have,
[01:44:48.100 --> 01:44:53.140]   can you abide in bitterness,
[01:44:53.140 --> 01:44:58.140]   and unforgiveness, and lovelessness, and hate?
[01:44:58.140 --> 01:44:59.100]   You cannot.
[01:44:59.100 --> 01:45:02.700]   And that's something to wrestle with.
[01:45:03.460 --> 01:45:05.900]   'Cause I think at times I wrestle with vindictiveness.
[01:45:05.900 --> 01:45:07.580]   If someone slaps me, I'm not like,
[01:45:07.580 --> 01:45:08.620]   oh, let me love you back.
[01:45:08.620 --> 01:45:10.220]   No, I wanna punch you back, right?
[01:45:10.220 --> 01:45:11.660]   It's like, hey, how dare you?
[01:45:11.660 --> 01:45:16.860]   But the Lord's been teaching me love.
[01:45:16.860 --> 01:45:20.780]   It's interesting, over the last four years,
[01:45:20.780 --> 01:45:23.740]   everyone I've had a falling out with in college,
[01:45:23.740 --> 01:45:28.180]   I've befriended in the last four years.
[01:45:28.180 --> 01:45:31.860]   I just had a conversation on a Zoom chat
[01:45:31.860 --> 01:45:34.980]   with my former roommate on Saturday night
[01:45:34.980 --> 01:45:36.900]   after 20 years of not really talking to him.
[01:45:36.900 --> 01:45:37.900]   And it was my fault.
[01:45:37.900 --> 01:45:40.420]   So I sought peace.
[01:45:40.420 --> 01:45:44.580]   Right before COVID, I ended up meeting for dinner
[01:45:44.580 --> 01:45:46.260]   another friend I hadn't seen in 15 years
[01:45:46.260 --> 01:45:48.500]   because we kinda had a falling out.
[01:45:48.500 --> 01:45:50.060]   It's the weirdest thing.
[01:45:50.060 --> 01:45:52.340]   I don't think of the person, I push them out of my mind,
[01:45:52.340 --> 01:45:54.460]   but God puts on my heart,
[01:45:54.460 --> 01:45:56.780]   hey, check in with this person, love them.
[01:45:59.100 --> 01:46:02.580]   And I will say, that is not something that's coming from me.
[01:46:02.580 --> 01:46:08.020]   It's the Lord just, mm, go reconcile with that person.
[01:46:08.020 --> 01:46:11.420]   It's like, go, go reconcile with that person.
[01:46:11.420 --> 01:46:16.980]   And when he guides me there, he provides great compassion,
[01:46:16.980 --> 01:46:19.060]   love, understanding, and humility.
[01:46:19.060 --> 01:46:25.580]   And I can't meditate on his word and stay bitter.
[01:46:25.580 --> 01:46:26.620]   I've discovered that.
[01:46:27.860 --> 01:46:29.420]   The seasons where I stay bitter
[01:46:29.420 --> 01:46:32.300]   is when I'm not paying any attention to his word.
[01:46:32.300 --> 01:46:33.140]   I'm not praying.
[01:46:33.140 --> 01:46:35.700]   I'm still coming to church, I'm still serving.
[01:46:35.700 --> 01:46:38.060]   But when I'm confronted with the word of God,
[01:46:38.060 --> 01:46:41.620]   when I'm praying to this living God,
[01:46:41.620 --> 01:46:44.860]   he changes my heart all the time.
[01:46:44.860 --> 01:46:50.140]   So if you're in unforgiveness, my guess is,
[01:46:50.140 --> 01:46:52.820]   you probably haven't been reading or praying much,
[01:46:52.820 --> 01:46:55.140]   or you're not a child of God.
[01:46:56.460 --> 01:46:57.780]   So that's something that,
[01:46:57.780 --> 01:47:01.060]   even if the worst possible thing has ever happened to you,
[01:47:01.060 --> 01:47:04.220]   if you are a child of God and you've been dunked
[01:47:04.220 --> 01:47:06.820]   into the ocean of his kindness and love,
[01:47:06.820 --> 01:47:08.420]   you can't come out just dry.
[01:47:08.420 --> 01:47:10.820]   Does that make sense?
[01:47:10.820 --> 01:47:17.180]   And that's something supernatural that God does to a heart.
[01:47:17.180 --> 01:47:20.380]   And if you're a Christian, he's done that already.
[01:47:20.380 --> 01:47:23.140]   Past tense, it's been done,
[01:47:23.140 --> 01:47:25.580]   but it has ongoing ramifications.
[01:47:26.580 --> 01:47:27.420]   Amen?
[01:47:27.420 --> 01:47:29.980]   So stretch those muscles
[01:47:29.980 --> 01:47:32.660]   so you can do the spiritual splits like crazy
[01:47:32.660 --> 01:47:34.980]   and not be all like, ah, okay?
[01:47:34.980 --> 01:47:35.820]   It's a muscle.
[01:47:35.820 --> 01:47:39.500]   Here's a question that I want you guys to break up
[01:47:39.500 --> 01:47:40.980]   and maybe share together.
[01:47:40.980 --> 01:47:42.220]   Are you a loving person?
[01:47:42.220 --> 01:47:46.540]   And that's a different question than are you nice.
[01:47:46.540 --> 01:47:48.620]   Okay?
[01:47:48.620 --> 01:47:52.540]   Some of the nicest people are the most bitter.
[01:47:52.540 --> 01:47:53.380]   It's weird.
[01:47:53.380 --> 01:47:54.620]   It's just, it's a mask.
[01:47:54.620 --> 01:47:56.700]   Okay, are you a loving person?
[01:47:56.700 --> 01:47:59.180]   Is there evidence of the effectual love of Christ
[01:47:59.180 --> 01:48:00.020]   in your life?
[01:48:00.020 --> 01:48:03.340]   Is that the fruit of the spirit that comes out
[01:48:03.340 --> 01:48:06.100]   when I explain, like, I go like, hey,
[01:48:06.100 --> 01:48:07.740]   yeah, you are such a loving person.
[01:48:07.740 --> 01:48:09.620]   You are such a joyful person.
[01:48:09.620 --> 01:48:10.860]   You're such a patient person.
[01:48:10.860 --> 01:48:13.380]   Is love something that's characteristic of you?
[01:48:13.380 --> 01:48:14.220]   And the second one is,
[01:48:14.220 --> 01:48:17.020]   in what ways can your group members pray for
[01:48:17.020 --> 01:48:21.620]   and encourage you to love a kletos, fervently?
[01:48:21.620 --> 01:48:23.340]   Okay, so those are the things I want you guys to discuss.
[01:48:23.340 --> 01:48:24.620]   And let me pray.
[01:48:24.620 --> 01:48:32.340]   Father, we only love in response to the love
[01:48:32.340 --> 01:48:33.660]   that you have for us.
[01:48:33.660 --> 01:48:36.340]   And as we get to know you better,
[01:48:36.340 --> 01:48:38.140]   I pray that you would help us to grow,
[01:48:38.140 --> 01:48:41.820]   to really have great compassion
[01:48:41.820 --> 01:48:43.980]   on our brothers and sisters in Christ,
[01:48:43.980 --> 01:48:47.180]   have great compassion for the lost,
[01:48:47.180 --> 01:48:50.620]   and ultimately, Lord, that we would spend our lives
[01:48:50.620 --> 01:48:52.380]   sharing your love and your kindness
[01:48:52.380 --> 01:48:54.500]   to the world around us.
[01:48:54.500 --> 01:48:55.660]   And Jesus, let me pray.
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:48:58.500]   (crowd murmuring)
[01:48:58.500 --> 01:49:01.340]   (camera clicking)
[01:49:01.340 --> 01:49:04.180]   (crowd murmuring)
[01:49:04.180 --> 01:49:07.020]   (camera clicking)
[01:49:07.020 --> 01:49:09.860]   (crowd murmuring)
[01:49:09.860 --> 01:49:12.700]   (camera clicking)
[01:49:12.700 --> 01:49:15.540]   (crowd murmuring)
[01:49:15.540 --> 01:49:18.380]   (camera clicking)
