[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Welcome to Breen Community Church, those of you
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.720]   who are here physically and those of you who are online with us.
[00:15:05.720 --> 00:15:08.720]   First of all, I want to thank Rachel and Andy
[00:15:08.720 --> 00:15:11.720]   for hosting the online auction.
[00:15:11.720 --> 00:15:17.200]   They told me that they were able to raise, I think, $17,500.
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:20.720]   So there was a lot of people who were very generous.
[00:15:20.720 --> 00:15:23.440]   Even those who donated their time and their talents
[00:15:23.440 --> 00:15:25.640]   and different things to be auctioned,
[00:15:25.640 --> 00:15:27.200]   they said they had over 100 of them.
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:29.520]   And so that's why we're able to raise all that.
[00:15:29.520 --> 00:15:30.920]   And again, every penny of that will
[00:15:30.920 --> 00:15:34.520]   be used for the work that is happening out in India.
[00:15:34.520 --> 00:15:35.920]   So we want to thank you for that.
[00:15:35.920 --> 00:15:38.680]   And then if we get an updated number, we'll let you know.
[00:15:38.680 --> 00:15:41.640]   But that's the tentative number that we have right now.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:43.600]   Next Sunday is Father's Day.
[00:15:43.600 --> 00:15:46.800]   And so if you are a father or if you're
[00:15:46.800 --> 00:15:51.160]   planning to become a father within the next nine months,
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:54.040]   or you have to-- your wife has to be pregnant.
[00:15:54.040 --> 00:15:55.640]   So if you want to make an announcement
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:58.520]   and you want to participate, let us know.
[00:15:58.520 --> 00:16:02.000]   Or if you're bringing a father that doesn't normally attend,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:03.760]   and we want to--
[00:16:03.760 --> 00:16:06.760]   if you can sign up for that also online so that we can have--
[00:16:06.760 --> 00:16:08.680]   we can make sure that we have enough food.
[00:16:08.680 --> 00:16:11.120]   And so that will be taking place after the second service--
[00:16:11.120 --> 00:16:13.880]   this service at the other building.
[00:16:13.880 --> 00:16:15.000]   So that's happening.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:16.920]   And then for the moms and the children,
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:18.880]   if you're sticking around and you need lunch,
[00:16:18.880 --> 00:16:21.120]   when you're signing up for that, please let them know
[00:16:21.120 --> 00:16:23.700]   so that they can have pizza and various things ready for you
[00:16:23.700 --> 00:16:25.800]   as well.
[00:16:25.800 --> 00:16:28.280]   Berean membership class is taking place--
[00:16:28.280 --> 00:16:30.320]   the next session in July 4.
[00:16:30.320 --> 00:16:31.840]   So this is an eight-week course.
[00:16:31.840 --> 00:16:35.520]   And again, this is specifically for the purpose
[00:16:35.520 --> 00:16:37.480]   of becoming a member in the church.
[00:16:37.480 --> 00:16:39.080]   And so if you are planning to do that,
[00:16:39.080 --> 00:16:41.240]   please let Pastor Nate know.
[00:16:41.240 --> 00:16:44.040]   Go through the app or just ask one of the Welcome Team members
[00:16:44.040 --> 00:16:45.760]   and let them know that that's happening.
[00:16:45.760 --> 00:16:47.600]   And again, it's an eight-week course.
[00:16:47.600 --> 00:16:49.220]   And that happens in the youth group room
[00:16:49.220 --> 00:16:52.000]   across the courtyard.
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.400]   And so they'll give you directions of that.
[00:16:55.400 --> 00:16:57.920]   And that's starting on July 4.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:00.800]   Also for VBS, July 19 to 23.
[00:17:00.800 --> 00:17:03.240]   So if you have children at the age of three,
[00:17:03.240 --> 00:17:04.680]   all the way to sixth grade.
[00:17:04.680 --> 00:17:06.360]   Sixth grade, going into sixth grade.
[00:17:06.360 --> 00:17:08.760]   So if you're a fifth grade and you're heading into sixth
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:09.400]   grade.
[00:17:09.400 --> 00:17:11.720]   So sixth graders who are graduating,
[00:17:11.720 --> 00:17:13.880]   there's going to be stuff for the youth group for you.
[00:17:13.880 --> 00:17:15.520]   So this is for those children who
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:17.960]   are turning-- going into sixth grade.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:20.120]   If you have a child who is three years old,
[00:17:20.120 --> 00:17:22.680]   I think you need to be potty trained.
[00:17:22.680 --> 00:17:26.400]   So you have basically one month to potty train your child.
[00:17:26.400 --> 00:17:28.320]   If he's not potty trained yet, if you want him
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:30.440]   to participate in the VBS.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.120]   So along with that, they're still asking for volunteers
[00:17:33.120 --> 00:17:34.840]   if you want to come and help out.
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:36.360]   Again, the requirement for that is
[00:17:36.360 --> 00:17:37.960]   you need to be a member of the church.
[00:17:37.960 --> 00:17:39.680]   And you need to be--
[00:17:39.680 --> 00:17:42.000]   if you are directly serving with the children,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.960]   you need to be at least a member of the church for at least
[00:17:43.960 --> 00:17:44.680]   a year.
[00:17:44.680 --> 00:17:47.280]   And again, this is for safety reasons.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:48.760]   We go through that process.
[00:17:48.760 --> 00:17:52.800]   If you want to volunteer for other parts
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.800]   where you're decorating or you're just doing prep work,
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:17:57.600]   you're not directly working with children,
[00:17:57.600 --> 00:18:00.240]   again, those requirements are not there for that.
[00:18:00.240 --> 00:18:04.480]   So if you want to help out along with that, again,
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:09.040]   you don't need to be a member for a year for that purpose.
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:11.400]   And then again, the evangelism outing that's happening,
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.640]   you can just continue to watch online for those announcements
[00:18:14.640 --> 00:18:19.520]   for the cafe outreach that's happening in July 31.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.360]   So this morning, we have a baby dedication.
[00:18:22.360 --> 00:18:24.160]   If I can have all the parents come up.
[00:18:24.160 --> 00:18:29.320]   So these are all the children that we
[00:18:29.320 --> 00:18:31.440]   are welcoming into church.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:36.240]   And this is just the beginning of the tsunami that's coming.
[00:18:36.240 --> 00:18:41.560]   So the pandemic has been very good to our family members.
[00:18:41.560 --> 00:18:43.400]   They've been very fruitful and multiplying.
[00:18:43.400 --> 00:18:45.960]   So this is-- in about a few months,
[00:18:45.960 --> 00:18:47.480]   we may be having this every week.
[00:18:47.480 --> 00:18:56.720]   Huh?
[00:18:56.720 --> 00:18:58.640]   Koroneans, is that the new name?
[00:18:58.640 --> 00:19:00.080]   Really?
[00:19:00.080 --> 00:19:01.640]   OK, so we have the parents.
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:04.880]   And then they're going to be introducing their children
[00:19:04.880 --> 00:19:07.320]   from, I think, from my right to the left, right?
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:09.560]   So if you can grab that mic.
[00:19:09.560 --> 00:19:14.640]   So Pastor Alec, are you number one?
[00:19:14.640 --> 00:19:18.480]   OK, I hope you guys are in order that you received the email.
[00:19:18.480 --> 00:19:21.840]   So they're going to give you a brief presentation
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:24.640]   of their children and then any prayer requests they have.
[00:19:24.640 --> 00:19:26.760]   And then we'll take a minute to pray for them
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:30.240]   before we dismiss them.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.920]   So my name is Alex, and this is my wife, Jen.
[00:19:32.920 --> 00:19:39.880]   And we'd like to introduce you to August, Valor, Jangwon,
[00:19:39.880 --> 00:19:41.640]   Hiroto Han.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:42.640]   So we-- yeah.
[00:19:42.640 --> 00:19:43.760]   Don't worry on his passport.
[00:19:43.760 --> 00:19:44.680]   It's just there.
[00:19:44.680 --> 00:19:47.320]   So we're being kind to him.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:48.840]   But yeah, we named him--
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:52.360]   all of our kids have names after heroes of the faith.
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:55.600]   And so we named him not after Augustine,
[00:19:55.600 --> 00:19:57.040]   as a lot of people think.
[00:19:57.040 --> 00:19:59.800]   We named him after Augustus Toplady, who
[00:19:59.800 --> 00:20:01.920]   wrote the hymn "Rock of Ages."
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.200]   And we just felt it was appropriate for the season
[00:20:04.200 --> 00:20:06.840]   that we're in, just trying to be--
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.280]   trying to be finding our foundation in Christ
[00:20:09.280 --> 00:20:11.600]   in the midst of all of these changes and transitions
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:12.920]   that our family is going through.
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:15.520]   So yeah, so here's August.
[00:20:15.520 --> 00:20:16.520]   Thank you.
[00:20:16.520 --> 00:20:18.440]   Oh, a prayer request?
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:21.120]   Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[00:20:21.120 --> 00:20:22.280]   Whatever you have, yeah.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:24.680]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:26.880]   Hi, everyone.
[00:20:26.880 --> 00:20:29.760]   I'm Daniel, and this is my wife, Helen.
[00:20:29.760 --> 00:20:33.160]   And this is Bennett Jongbin Poon.
[00:20:33.160 --> 00:20:35.080]   We chose the name Bennett because we
[00:20:35.080 --> 00:20:36.760]   like the sound and the meaning.
[00:20:36.760 --> 00:20:39.200]   The meaning comes from a Latin word, which means
[00:20:39.200 --> 00:20:41.620]   "blessed" or "little blessed one."
[00:20:41.620 --> 00:20:45.680]   And today, he's actually six months old, exactly.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:48.400]   The interesting story is that we originally
[00:20:48.400 --> 00:20:53.360]   hoped that he would be born on 12/12, December 12, 2020,
[00:20:53.360 --> 00:20:56.480]   two 12s and two 20s, because his name has
[00:20:56.480 --> 00:20:57.560]   a lot of double letters.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:02.400]   So Bennett has two Es, two Ns, two Ts,
[00:21:02.400 --> 00:21:05.520]   and his last name has two Os.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:09.680]   But as is often the case, God had other plans.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:14.440]   He was born on 12/13, 2020.
[00:21:14.440 --> 00:21:18.600]   So no beautiful symmetry or order in his name,
[00:21:18.600 --> 00:21:20.600]   unfortunately.
[00:21:20.600 --> 00:21:21.760]   We have two prayer requests.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:25.600]   The first is that Bennett would grow up and know
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:28.080]   the truth of the gospel and accept Christ as Lord
[00:21:28.080 --> 00:21:31.240]   and Savior, despite growing up in what
[00:21:31.240 --> 00:21:35.120]   seems like a more and more secular world.
[00:21:35.120 --> 00:21:38.160]   And the second is just that he would
[00:21:38.160 --> 00:21:40.520]   know that God is always with him and cling to Christ,
[00:21:40.520 --> 00:21:42.960]   no matter what challenges or difficulties
[00:21:42.960 --> 00:21:44.400]   he faces in life.
[00:21:44.400 --> 00:21:44.900]   Thanks.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:50.000]   Hello, Good Morning Church Family.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:52.720]   My name's Eugene, and this is my wife, Joanna.
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:55.200]   And we have two girls, and this is our second.
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   And she turns five months tomorrow.
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:02.760]   And her name's Eden, Eden Zoe Song.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:04.880]   And our prayer request, ultimately,
[00:22:04.880 --> 00:22:09.960]   is that she would live out the significance of her name
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:14.640]   and that she would be a testament
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:17.920]   to a delightful, full life, the rich life, the abundant life
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.480]   that we have in Christ.
[00:22:19.480 --> 00:22:21.800]   And so if you guys could join us in praying for that,
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:22.640]   that would be great.
[00:22:22.640 --> 00:22:29.720]   Hi, beloved Church Family.
[00:22:29.720 --> 00:22:30.400]   My name is Sean.
[00:22:30.400 --> 00:22:31.840]   This is my wife, Yen.
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.400]   Yen and I would like to introduce you
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:35.520]   to our second son, Ethan.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.240]   We're very grateful to God for blessing us
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.000]   with another son, another arrow in our quiver.
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:45.600]   Would you guys please pray for our sons, both Oliver and Ethan,
[00:22:45.600 --> 00:22:47.320]   that they would not only grow in stature,
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:52.080]   but of course, in knowledge of our Savior, Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:53.880]   If it is God's will, we would like--
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:55.560]   hopefully, our sons would repent,
[00:22:55.560 --> 00:22:59.400]   and God would grace both Oliver and Ethan with saving faith.
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:01.320]   Also, just a little shout of praise,
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:02.520]   God, for my brilliant bride.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.920]   She feeds our sons, cleans them, clothes them,
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:07.000]   teaches them, prays for them, and overall nurtures
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:08.360]   each day.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.360]   She's really a remarkable reminder in my life
[00:23:10.360 --> 00:23:12.520]   that we are sinners saved by God's grace
[00:23:12.520 --> 00:23:14.920]   and continually being sanctified.
[00:23:14.920 --> 00:23:16.720]   So yeah, would you please also pray
[00:23:16.720 --> 00:23:18.680]   that our God would faithfully lead us to confession,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:20.920]   repentance, and growing reliance on our Lord,
[00:23:20.920 --> 00:23:22.560]   and that our lifelong marriage would be
[00:23:22.560 --> 00:23:24.640]   enduring and God-glorifying.
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:25.920]   Thanks, brothers and sisters.
[00:23:25.920 --> 00:23:31.680]   Hi, Church Family.
[00:23:31.680 --> 00:23:32.180]   I'm Johnny.
[00:23:32.180 --> 00:23:32.880]   This is Joyce.
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.760]   This is our son, Jacob Micah Nguyen.
[00:23:35.760 --> 00:23:37.640]   He's 2 and 1/2, almost three years old.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:42.280]   We named him after Jacob in the Bible for three reasons.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.960]   One, his name started with a J. Two,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.160]   after going through the Hebrew sermons,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:50.120]   and we learned more about Jacob.
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:53.160]   And despite his flaws, was a man of faith.
[00:23:53.160 --> 00:23:56.440]   And three, we thought his name was cute.
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:02.440]   So some convictions we learned as becoming first-time parents
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:09.600]   is, despite not knowing what to do a lot of times,
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:11.360]   we have the word.
[00:24:11.360 --> 00:24:12.480]   We have the church.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:15.960]   And God gives us the spirit in Jesus,
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:19.560]   and he's willing to give wisdom to those who ask.
[00:24:19.560 --> 00:24:22.520]   So those are reassuring things for us.
[00:24:22.520 --> 00:24:25.000]   And so for prayer requests for us,
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:27.040]   if you could pray for Jacob's salvation,
[00:24:27.040 --> 00:24:31.880]   that God would soften his heart, to give him
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:35.000]   ears to hear and eyes to see, that God would reveal himself
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:40.280]   to Jacob so that he may meet and know Christ, who is holy God,
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.000]   but also a God of love and mercy,
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.360]   and know his kindness of God that leads him to repentance,
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:48.440]   and that God would use Joyce and I to give us wisdom
[00:24:48.440 --> 00:24:51.480]   and speak through us and speak in action.
[00:24:51.480 --> 00:24:51.960]   Thank you.
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:58.560]   Good morning, brothers and sisters.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:01.360]   My name is Lee, and my wife, Esther.
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:08.600]   And we would like to introduce our son, Boaz Hajoon Lee.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:10.720]   And he's 3 and 1/2 years old.
[00:25:10.720 --> 00:25:15.680]   He's now the youngest of five, and he was adopted from Korea
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:16.760]   eight months ago.
[00:25:16.760 --> 00:25:24.120]   His name is Boaz because my father always
[00:25:24.120 --> 00:25:32.480]   liked the character Boaz, what he did,
[00:25:32.480 --> 00:25:36.320]   and what a man of character he was in the Bible.
[00:25:36.320 --> 00:25:40.680]   And traditionally, my father named all our children's
[00:25:40.680 --> 00:25:41.640]   Korean name.
[00:25:41.640 --> 00:25:43.400]   He never got to name their American name.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:47.400]   But since Hajoon, we kept his Korean name,
[00:25:47.400 --> 00:25:50.440]   we decided to name him the name that my father always loved,
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.200]   which was Boaz.
[00:25:52.200 --> 00:25:56.560]   His middle name is Hajoon because his birth mother loved
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:58.400]   him enough to carry him through pregnancy
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:03.480]   and loved him enough to put him up for adoption for a home.
[00:26:03.480 --> 00:26:06.440]   And so we wanted to keep his Korean name.
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:08.240]   And obviously, his last name is our name.
[00:26:08.240 --> 00:26:13.800]   Our prayer requests.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:16.920]   We would like to pray for two things.
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:25.120]   First, obviously, his growth for the love of the Lord,
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:30.160]   and that God woos his heart into his fold,
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:32.160]   and his name is written in the book of life.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:36.440]   But also for us and me in particular,
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:40.120]   that we continually be a student of our children,
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:44.280]   especially Boaz, as he grows so we can study and understand
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:46.840]   where his strengths are and where his talents are.
[00:26:46.840 --> 00:26:50.720]   So that we can support him and rear him up
[00:26:50.720 --> 00:26:52.040]   in the ways of the Lord.
[00:26:52.040 --> 00:26:52.540]   Thank you.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:57.160]   Hello, everyone.
[00:26:57.160 --> 00:26:59.200]   I'm Jason, and this is my wife, Jen.
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.920]   This is our wild and rambunctious little boy, Ethan.
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:05.880]   We came upon the name Ethan.
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:08.040]   I think we were going through the year of the Bible,
[00:27:08.040 --> 00:27:11.560]   and I looked up the meaning one day and saw that it said
[00:27:11.560 --> 00:27:16.060]   it was enduring, solid, persevering one.
[00:27:16.060 --> 00:27:18.120]   So I really like the meaning behind that,
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.960]   especially because of the times that we're in.
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:22.520]   His middle name is Shiu.
[00:27:22.520 --> 00:27:25.400]   It's similar to Lee and Esther.
[00:27:25.400 --> 00:27:29.120]   We kept the original name that the biological mom gave him
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:30.600]   so that he would know his story.
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:33.080]   And a couple prayer requests.
[00:27:33.080 --> 00:27:39.520]   One, that he would come to a saving faith in early age,
[00:27:39.520 --> 00:27:40.920]   much like everyone else.
[00:27:40.920 --> 00:27:44.360]   But secondly, just like his name says,
[00:27:44.360 --> 00:27:47.280]   that he would persevere and that he
[00:27:47.280 --> 00:27:49.080]   would be solid in his faith.
[00:27:49.080 --> 00:27:49.580]   Thank you.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:58.440]   OK.
[00:27:58.440 --> 00:28:00.920]   Before we pray for the children and the family,
[00:28:00.920 --> 00:28:03.480]   I just want to encourage you guys.
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:05.240]   Part of the reason why we do this
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:09.040]   is we want our church, no matter what size it gets,
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:12.400]   that we would view these children as an extension
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:15.520]   of our personal families, that we don't watch these families
[00:28:15.520 --> 00:28:17.000]   as like, oh, they're disconnected.
[00:28:17.000 --> 00:28:18.960]   We just happen to go to the same church.
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:22.000]   But that we would participate in raising these children.
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:24.000]   And so I know that a lot of our church members
[00:28:24.000 --> 00:28:28.280]   are already volunteering in Sunday schools and other things.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:31.160]   But we're hoping and praying that our church would truly
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:33.360]   be a community.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:35.640]   In the midst of darkness and with all
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:37.600]   that's going on in the school systems,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:40.640]   that our church would be a place where these children come
[00:28:40.640 --> 00:28:43.440]   and realize visually, not just within their families,
[00:28:43.440 --> 00:28:47.040]   but collectively, what God desires of his community.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.640]   That we would really be able to build a church where
[00:28:49.640 --> 00:28:52.720]   they are being raised in a Christian community.
[00:28:52.720 --> 00:28:54.560]   And so in order to do that, the commitment
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:56.000]   has to be beyond the parents.
[00:28:56.000 --> 00:28:58.960]   Just like they said, it requires a village to raise children.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.560]   And so this is our village.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:04.000]   And so we're asking not only for the parents, but every member,
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.560]   whether you have children or not,
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:09.960]   that we would put on the parental mindset
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.080]   when we see these children.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   So when you see children running on the streets,
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:14.920]   like, oh, where are the parents?
[00:29:14.920 --> 00:29:16.960]   Take action.
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:18.640]   You're not allowed to spank them.
[00:29:18.640 --> 00:29:21.920]   But have a heart of parent for every child in our church
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:23.280]   that we would care for them.
[00:29:23.280 --> 00:29:25.680]   And so that just as every single parent is praying that they
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:27.240]   would come to the faith early, you
[00:29:27.240 --> 00:29:28.900]   don't have to be a Sunday school teacher
[00:29:28.900 --> 00:29:30.120]   to share the gospel with them.
[00:29:30.120 --> 00:29:33.440]   Maybe one of these days, you'll have them at a table.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.920]   And don't think that because they're young,
[00:29:35.920 --> 00:29:37.280]   they can't understand the gospel.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:38.440]   They can understand.
[00:29:38.440 --> 00:29:41.360]   And so sometimes it could be a random situation
[00:29:41.360 --> 00:29:43.040]   where you're playing with them that you're
[00:29:43.040 --> 00:29:44.480]   able to share the gospel.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:47.280]   And so my children heard the gospel that way as well,
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:48.920]   when people were over at our house.
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.660]   And they would just randomly have conversation
[00:29:50.660 --> 00:29:51.500]   when they were young.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:53.440]   And so we had various people in our church
[00:29:53.440 --> 00:29:54.840]   to share the gospel with them.
[00:29:54.840 --> 00:29:56.220]   And so whenever we heard that, we
[00:29:56.220 --> 00:29:58.200]   were so encouraged that our church was looking out
[00:29:58.200 --> 00:29:59.300]   for our children that way.
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:00.920]   So no matter how big our church gets,
[00:30:00.920 --> 00:30:02.440]   we're hoping and praying that that's
[00:30:02.440 --> 00:30:04.920]   something that we can continue to build together
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:05.920]   along with the parents.
[00:30:05.920 --> 00:30:07.480]   So that's why we present the children
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:09.960]   so that you'd be aware of who they are, who the parents are.
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:11.800]   So let me pray for them.
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:14.880]   And then as I pray for them, I will also pray for the offering.
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:16.920]   And then we'll dismiss the families after that.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:17.840]   All right, let's pray.
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:23.040]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the blessing
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:25.960]   that you've given each one of these families.
[00:30:25.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   And we know with all the ups and downs and the challenges that
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:32.720]   come from raising a child, Lord God, in this fallen world,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:36.760]   I pray for parents, the fathers, to teach them,
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:39.680]   Lord God, what it means to lead, even with all the flaws
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:41.920]   and their shortcomings.
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:43.840]   I pray, Father, that your love and your grace
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:45.480]   will be sufficient for them.
[00:30:45.480 --> 00:30:48.160]   And allow them to lead their homes in a way, Father God,
[00:30:48.160 --> 00:30:49.680]   that they may know you.
[00:30:49.680 --> 00:30:52.160]   I pray for the mothers in the time of exhaustion
[00:30:52.160 --> 00:30:56.200]   and tiredness, Lord God, that their fuel would come from you.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.400]   I pray that these homes would be a place where
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:01.640]   the gospel is shared and that they practice their faith,
[00:31:01.640 --> 00:31:03.160]   Lord God, in love.
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:05.800]   Teach them when to practice discipline,
[00:31:05.800 --> 00:31:08.960]   when to be gracious, what to teach, Lord God,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:10.960]   that by example, not just by words,
[00:31:10.960 --> 00:31:13.120]   that they may see the love of Christ overflowing
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:14.320]   in this home.
[00:31:14.320 --> 00:31:15.840]   That these children will know, Father,
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.920]   that the eternal things are much more valuable than the things,
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.520]   Lord, that are temporal.
[00:31:20.520 --> 00:31:22.440]   So for that end, I pray for your blessing,
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:25.280]   that the gospel may come into these homes early
[00:31:25.280 --> 00:31:28.520]   and that these children would come to faith early in faith
[00:31:28.520 --> 00:31:30.800]   so that they may live long lives, Lord God,
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:33.000]   be an example of Christ in this dark world.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:34.960]   So for that end, we pray for your blessing,
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:37.440]   that even in our giving, help us to give
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.440]   and that it may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold,
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:42.920]   that the kingdom of God may continue to grow
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:44.760]   and that more and more people may know
[00:31:44.760 --> 00:31:47.080]   that salvation is in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:31:47.080 --> 00:31:49.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:52.560]   [APPLAUSE]
[00:31:52.560 --> 00:31:57.080]   OK, we'll dismiss the parents now.
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:01.840]   OK, why don't we all stand up for the praise?

[00:39:14.040 --> 00:39:28.000]   Come behold.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:32.480]   Come behold the wondrous mystery.
[00:39:32.480 --> 00:39:37.440]   Slain by death, the God of life.
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:41.920]   But no grave can ever strain Him.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:43.920]   Praise the Lord.
[00:39:43.920 --> 00:39:46.400]   He is alive.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:51.880]   And what a fortress of deliverance.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:56.880]   How unwavering our hope.
[00:39:56.880 --> 00:40:06.360]   Christ in power, resurrected, as we will be when He comes.
[00:40:06.360 --> 00:40:10.840]   What a fortress of deliverance.
[00:40:10.840 --> 00:40:16.320]   How unwavering our hope.
[00:40:16.320 --> 00:40:26.760]   Christ in power, resurrected, as we will be when He comes.
[00:40:26.760 --> 00:40:30.740]   Amen.
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:31.480]   You may be seated.
[00:40:31.480 --> 00:40:37.980]   All right.
[00:40:37.980 --> 00:40:39.440]   If you can turn your Bibles with me,
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.960]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses 12 and 13.
[00:40:43.960 --> 00:40:46.200]   Hebrews chapter 12, verses 12 and 13.
[00:40:46.200 --> 00:40:52.200]   We'll be reading the NASB.
[00:40:52.200 --> 00:40:56.960]   "Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.880]   and the knees that are feeble.
[00:40:58.880 --> 00:41:00.320]   Make straight paths for your feet
[00:41:00.320 --> 00:41:03.760]   so that the limb which is lame may not be put out of joint,
[00:41:03.760 --> 00:41:05.040]   but rather be healed."
[00:41:05.040 --> 00:41:07.360]   Let's pray.
[00:41:07.360 --> 00:41:09.120]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:41:09.120 --> 00:41:11.840]   We pray for your guidance by your word.
[00:41:11.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   I pray that our hearts may be molded, Lord God,
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:17.800]   and that your word would guide and lead us
[00:41:17.800 --> 00:41:19.720]   and sanctify your church.
[00:41:19.720 --> 00:41:25.280]   Lord, we know that the preaching is just words, Lord God,
[00:41:25.280 --> 00:41:28.160]   unless you ordain it and illuminate us and cause us,
[00:41:28.160 --> 00:41:30.280]   Lord, to see who you are.
[00:41:30.280 --> 00:41:31.760]   So we pray for guidance.
[00:41:31.760 --> 00:41:34.280]   We pray, Lord, that your grace would allow us, Lord,
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:37.960]   to hear and to practice and to be changed.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:39.040]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:41:39.040 --> 00:41:39.540]   Amen.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:45.560]   Yesterday, myself, Elder James, and Pastor Mark,
[00:41:45.560 --> 00:41:51.880]   we did a podcast together on the subject of deconstructionism.
[00:41:51.880 --> 00:41:54.640]   So some of you guys who may have heard the term
[00:41:54.640 --> 00:41:56.760]   or maybe have been hearing it around,
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:42:00.720]   and basically what's going on, again, the latest trend
[00:42:00.720 --> 00:42:03.880]   is for people to re-examine their faith
[00:42:03.880 --> 00:42:06.840]   and possibly even questioning the fundamentals of what
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:07.880]   we believe.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:09.440]   Like, is the Bible real?
[00:42:09.440 --> 00:42:10.600]   Are the miracles real?
[00:42:10.600 --> 00:42:13.480]   Is the church necessary?
[00:42:13.480 --> 00:42:17.840]   And this was sparked by a few well-known pastors who
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:21.720]   basically denied their faith and walked away from Christianity,
[00:42:21.720 --> 00:42:24.040]   basically condemning the Christianity
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:27.560]   that they belonged to and they participated in, and even led.
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.880]   And many people came to Christ through them.
[00:42:29.880 --> 00:42:33.320]   And so because of that, and I think
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:35.120]   it basically triggered a lot of people,
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:39.760]   just almost encouraging people to go back and re-examine
[00:42:39.760 --> 00:42:40.960]   their faith.
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:44.200]   I think re-examining our faith is always necessary,
[00:42:44.200 --> 00:42:48.680]   because we do live in a somewhat Christian culture, at least
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:49.400]   where we live.
[00:42:49.400 --> 00:42:53.120]   And you sometimes feel pressure to become a Christian
[00:42:53.120 --> 00:42:54.560]   when you're in college.
[00:42:54.560 --> 00:42:56.480]   And then you make a bunch of Christian friends.
[00:42:56.480 --> 00:42:58.480]   Maybe you came from a Christian home.
[00:42:58.480 --> 00:43:00.400]   And as a result of that, being in church
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.680]   was a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:05.360]   And maybe you never seriously examined
[00:43:05.360 --> 00:43:07.920]   what you truly believed.
[00:43:07.920 --> 00:43:11.600]   But in that process, the danger that we are seeing now
[00:43:11.600 --> 00:43:16.640]   is that it's almost encouraged, that it's almost normal
[00:43:16.640 --> 00:43:21.560]   that we go back and revisit, is the Bible even real?
[00:43:21.560 --> 00:43:22.880]   Does God even exist?
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:25.800]   Did the resurrection really happen?
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:28.280]   And in that context, many people are
[00:43:28.280 --> 00:43:30.720]   beginning to realize that maybe they
[00:43:30.720 --> 00:43:34.400]   weren't believers to begin with.
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.080]   I think most of us, if you've been
[00:43:36.080 --> 00:43:37.920]   a Christian for any period of time,
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:40.640]   you can probably name at least one person,
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:42.800]   or maybe many people, that at one point,
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:46.000]   maybe you looked up to and you ran the race with,
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.120]   are no longer walking with God.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.920]   Maybe a professor, maybe your Sunday school teacher,
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:56.400]   maybe your youth pastor, maybe a good friend of yours,
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:57.960]   that at one point, you were excited
[00:43:57.960 --> 00:43:59.080]   and you're walking with God.
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:02.320]   And by all definitions of what the Bible teaches,
[00:44:02.320 --> 00:44:04.880]   what a Christian is, they are no longer walking with God.
[00:44:04.880 --> 00:44:06.280]   They're not believers in Christ.
[00:44:06.280 --> 00:44:11.240]   This is not anything new.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.480]   This is not a new phenomenon in what's
[00:44:13.480 --> 00:44:15.640]   going on in our generation, that all of a sudden,
[00:44:15.640 --> 00:44:18.360]   2,000 years later, after the death and resurrection
[00:44:18.360 --> 00:44:21.800]   of Christ, this new thing of deconstructionism is going on.
[00:44:21.800 --> 00:44:23.680]   This has happened from the very first century,
[00:44:23.680 --> 00:44:25.920]   from the very beginning.
[00:44:25.920 --> 00:44:26.880]   Jesus warned.
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:29.440]   He said that some seeds are going to fall on certain soils
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.980]   and they're going to look like they're
[00:44:30.980 --> 00:44:32.760]   going to bear fruit for a period.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:34.800]   But then, because they don't have any foundation,
[00:44:34.800 --> 00:44:36.320]   they're going to disappear.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:38.400]   Some of them are going to fall on soils
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.320]   and they just disbelieve and they walk away.
[00:44:40.320 --> 00:44:42.800]   And then there are some soils where the seed falls
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   on the third soil.
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:46.240]   And in the beginning, it looks like they're bearing fruit.
[00:44:46.240 --> 00:44:49.200]   But because of the worries and concern and deceitfulness
[00:44:49.200 --> 00:44:52.040]   of this world, their faith gets choked out.
[00:44:52.040 --> 00:44:54.240]   And as a result, they die.
[00:44:54.240 --> 00:44:56.760]   So whether you call it deconstructionism
[00:44:56.760 --> 00:44:58.920]   or backsliding or fading or slipping,
[00:44:58.920 --> 00:45:00.600]   whatever you want to call it, it is
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:02.920]   nothing new to our generation.
[00:45:02.920 --> 00:45:05.160]   The Bible tells us that this will happen.
[00:45:05.160 --> 00:45:07.560]   And so people who are going through this process
[00:45:07.560 --> 00:45:10.760]   are only coming to realize that maybe they never really
[00:45:10.760 --> 00:45:13.160]   had faith to begin with.
[00:45:13.160 --> 00:45:15.800]   And this is why it's necessary for us
[00:45:15.800 --> 00:45:21.160]   to examine and make sure that we are truly anchored in Christ,
[00:45:21.160 --> 00:45:23.720]   that our dependency is not the community,
[00:45:23.720 --> 00:45:26.840]   that our dependency is not our support group and our family,
[00:45:26.840 --> 00:45:28.720]   friends, or our tradition.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:30.320]   But do I really believe in Christ?
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:32.800]   Am I anchored in Christ?
[00:45:32.800 --> 00:45:36.360]   That even if everybody that I know falls away,
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:37.640]   that I am anchored in Christ?
[00:45:37.640 --> 00:45:42.720]   Even if the biggest waves come, I am anchored in Christ.
[00:45:42.720 --> 00:45:44.520]   The text that we're looking at this morning
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:47.240]   is in the context of the larger context
[00:45:47.240 --> 00:45:50.760]   where the author has been trying to get
[00:45:50.760 --> 00:45:54.040]   the readers to continue to take their faith seriously and not
[00:45:54.040 --> 00:45:56.120]   drift.
[00:45:56.120 --> 00:45:59.200]   Now, they weren't guilty of apostasy.
[00:45:59.200 --> 00:46:01.360]   They weren't guilty of waking up one morning and say,
[00:46:01.360 --> 00:46:01.720]   you know what?
[00:46:01.720 --> 00:46:02.680]   I don't want Jesus.
[00:46:02.680 --> 00:46:04.880]   And I'm going to run toward my old life.
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:06.160]   That's not what was happening.
[00:46:06.160 --> 00:46:09.000]   The constant warning is do not drift, do not neglect,
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.120]   do not drift.
[00:46:11.120 --> 00:46:14.760]   Because most people who experience deconstructionism
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:19.440]   or backsliding usually happens way before they're
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:21.480]   ever public about it.
[00:46:21.480 --> 00:46:23.640]   That was probably happening behind the scene
[00:46:23.640 --> 00:46:24.480]   where they were questioning.
[00:46:24.480 --> 00:46:25.880]   Maybe they weren't walking right with God.
[00:46:25.880 --> 00:46:27.400]   Maybe there was a sin in their life
[00:46:27.400 --> 00:46:28.960]   that they weren't confessing that
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:32.840]   caused a strain or quenching of the spirit.
[00:46:32.840 --> 00:46:36.520]   And instead of realizing that maybe something in them
[00:46:36.520 --> 00:46:39.680]   was flawed, they turned that table around and began
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:42.920]   to point to the church or the pastors or to the Bible
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:47.440]   itself, saying maybe they're wrong and I'm not the cause.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:50.480]   It is in that context that this author has
[00:46:50.480 --> 00:46:52.640]   been going through Christology chapter after chapter
[00:46:52.640 --> 00:46:56.320]   after chapter that we do not drift from this.
[00:46:56.320 --> 00:46:57.800]   And so we're in chapter 12.
[00:46:57.800 --> 00:47:00.480]   We're saying, considering all of this, therefore--
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:02.440]   so we have such a great of witnesses
[00:47:02.440 --> 00:47:04.760]   that has gone before us to lay aside
[00:47:04.760 --> 00:47:07.840]   every encumbrance and sin which so easily entangles us so
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.560]   that we do not continue to drift.
[00:47:10.560 --> 00:47:12.960]   And then in verse 12 that we're looking at where it says,
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:15.840]   "Therefore, considering what Christ has done for us,
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:17.880]   strengthen the hands that are weak
[00:47:17.880 --> 00:47:21.600]   and the knees that are feeble."
[00:47:21.600 --> 00:47:23.760]   We have no reason to quit.
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.040]   If you are a genuine believer in Christ,
[00:47:26.040 --> 00:47:27.920]   there is no reason to quit.
[00:47:27.920 --> 00:47:30.920]   That's what he means in verse 4 when he said,
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.320]   "You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood
[00:47:33.320 --> 00:47:36.000]   in your striving against sin."
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:38.640]   Christ has shed his blood for us.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:39.760]   Our salvation was given.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.320]   We didn't earn this.
[00:47:42.320 --> 00:47:46.560]   So a genuine Christian has no reason to quit,
[00:47:46.560 --> 00:47:48.480]   no matter what struggle, no matter what trial,
[00:47:48.480 --> 00:47:52.080]   because Christ knowing our weakness,
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:56.400]   Christ knowing our struggle has shed his blood for us.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.960]   So the only Christian that truly fails in the kingdom of God
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:02.680]   is the one who quits.
[00:48:02.680 --> 00:48:04.880]   And so he's encouraging and challenging
[00:48:04.880 --> 00:48:08.960]   the church to persevere because it is for that reason
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.440]   that Christ died for us.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:15.480]   Since we have a God who is perfect,
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.920]   who does not make mistakes, there's no reason to quit.
[00:48:18.920 --> 00:48:21.480]   Since we have a God who loves us,
[00:48:21.480 --> 00:48:23.680]   and that even in the most difficult circumstances,
[00:48:23.680 --> 00:48:26.640]   it's a proof of our relationship with him,
[00:48:26.640 --> 00:48:29.120]   so therefore we don't need to quit.
[00:48:29.120 --> 00:48:31.720]   Since we have a God that even in our most difficult
[00:48:31.720 --> 00:48:35.560]   circumstances are orchestrating things for our own good
[00:48:35.560 --> 00:48:38.320]   to train us to be more like him, therefore
[00:48:38.320 --> 00:48:39.560]   we do not need to quit.
[00:48:39.560 --> 00:48:42.240]   And that was the point that we were trying to make last week
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:43.880]   in the passages.
[00:48:43.880 --> 00:48:45.840]   And here in verse 12, he continues.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:48.680]   He says, "Therefore, therefore we
[00:48:48.680 --> 00:48:50.880]   believe in a sovereign God who loved us, died for us.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:52.480]   There's no reason to quit.
[00:48:52.480 --> 00:48:54.720]   Therefore, strengthen the hands that are weak
[00:48:54.720 --> 00:48:57.880]   and the knees that are feeble."
[00:48:57.880 --> 00:49:00.240]   Let me stop right here because this is a passage.
[00:49:00.240 --> 00:49:03.040]   Verse 12 and 13 is a passage that we know well.
[00:49:03.040 --> 00:49:06.520]   This is kind of like, let's get going type of passage.
[00:49:06.520 --> 00:49:10.480]   If you're struggling, find out what your weaknesses are
[00:49:10.480 --> 00:49:13.280]   and make a list of things that you need to correct.
[00:49:13.280 --> 00:49:17.480]   And then get things right, and then let's do it.
[00:49:17.480 --> 00:49:22.000]   But before we even get to that, we need to first understand--
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:23.800]   this is why we have inductive Bible study,
[00:49:23.800 --> 00:49:26.200]   because we want to make sure that all
[00:49:26.200 --> 00:49:30.320]   of the meaning and the imagery that is given in the text
[00:49:30.320 --> 00:49:33.840]   is actually what we are getting out of the text.
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:36.480]   First of all, the word for the passage,
[00:49:36.480 --> 00:49:39.080]   "strengthen the hands that are weak,"
[00:49:39.080 --> 00:49:41.000]   is not an exact translation.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.240]   It's more of a transliteration so
[00:49:43.240 --> 00:49:45.920]   that we can have the gist of what the meaning is.
[00:49:45.920 --> 00:49:49.000]   But if you look at the King James Version, where they
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.440]   didn't care at all whether you understood it or not.
[00:49:51.440 --> 00:49:53.400]   They just kind of translated it exactly the way
[00:49:53.400 --> 00:49:55.000]   it is written in the Greek.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.200]   In the King James Translation, the meaning behind it
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:01.840]   is basically to lift up drooping hands.
[00:50:01.840 --> 00:50:02.920]   So lift up drooping hands.
[00:50:02.920 --> 00:50:07.840]   So the imagery in our head is right there.
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:11.600]   So imagery that's given in verse 12
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.520]   is an individual where the hands are drooped.
[00:50:14.520 --> 00:50:16.120]   And then the second part of that,
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:18.840]   "and the knees that are feeble," meaning
[00:50:18.840 --> 00:50:21.520]   that there's no strength in their knees that are shaking.
[00:50:21.520 --> 00:50:23.760]   So what do you think that's a picture of?
[00:50:23.760 --> 00:50:32.440]   Take a guess of the context of somebody
[00:50:32.440 --> 00:50:33.560]   who would be drawn that way.
[00:50:37.200 --> 00:50:40.920]   This looks like somebody who's in the middle of a marathon,
[00:50:40.920 --> 00:50:45.320]   maybe about halfway through.
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.240]   And they're just fatigued.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:50.240]   And they're out of breath.
[00:50:50.240 --> 00:50:52.320]   And they don't have the same kind of vigor
[00:50:52.320 --> 00:50:54.320]   that they had in the beginning.
[00:50:54.320 --> 00:50:56.920]   And so when an individual gets to that point,
[00:50:56.920 --> 00:50:57.920]   what are they thinking?
[00:50:57.920 --> 00:51:02.360]   Hamburger?
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:04.520]   What are they thinking here?
[00:51:04.520 --> 00:51:06.360]   Quitting, exactly.
[00:51:06.360 --> 00:51:09.880]   So this is a picture of an individual who
[00:51:09.880 --> 00:51:13.320]   started the race well, but at some point
[00:51:13.320 --> 00:51:17.040]   has lost their vigor and have no energy, is slooped down,
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.120]   and their knees are starting to buckle.
[00:51:19.120 --> 00:51:20.880]   And in their mind, they're probably
[00:51:20.880 --> 00:51:24.320]   thinking that I don't know if I can continue on.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:27.080]   That is who he's addressing.
[00:51:27.080 --> 00:51:31.920]   He's addressing an individual or a group of people
[00:51:31.920 --> 00:51:34.520]   who just don't have the strength.
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:37.760]   And they say, oh my gosh, how am I going to make it?
[00:51:37.760 --> 00:51:41.320]   I still have another 13 miles to go.
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:43.440]   And I'm exhausted now.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:46.320]   Am I going to be able to persevere?
[00:51:46.320 --> 00:51:49.320]   It is at this point where many people
[00:51:49.320 --> 00:51:52.120]   begin to change their theology.
[00:51:52.120 --> 00:51:53.440]   Maybe I'm not the problem.
[00:51:53.440 --> 00:51:54.520]   Maybe they're the problem.
[00:51:54.520 --> 00:51:57.600]   Maybe the reason why I feel this way and I'm exhausted
[00:51:57.600 --> 00:51:59.200]   is because the church has wronged me.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:00.240]   These people have wronged me.
[00:52:00.240 --> 00:52:01.580]   Maybe I was at the wrong church.
[00:52:01.580 --> 00:52:03.200]   Maybe I was at the wrong group.
[00:52:03.200 --> 00:52:06.720]   And we have a tendency to either change our theology,
[00:52:06.720 --> 00:52:09.520]   change our circumstance, change various things,
[00:52:09.520 --> 00:52:12.480]   because I don't think I can go on.
[00:52:12.480 --> 00:52:17.360]   This is the place where the thoughts of deconstruction
[00:52:17.360 --> 00:52:22.520]   comes in, because they're ready to quit.
[00:52:22.520 --> 00:52:26.040]   So instead of saying, I couldn't finish this race,
[00:52:26.040 --> 00:52:30.120]   they say, maybe the race wasn't the right race to begin with.
[00:52:30.120 --> 00:52:32.240]   Maybe I was trained wrong.
[00:52:32.240 --> 00:52:35.600]   Maybe my trainers were wrong.
[00:52:35.600 --> 00:52:37.760]   It is these people that they are addressing.
[00:52:37.760 --> 00:52:40.440]   And it is these people who are at this point
[00:52:40.440 --> 00:52:43.040]   that the whole book of Hebrews is written to,
[00:52:43.040 --> 00:52:45.640]   who have their hands drooped, their knees are beginning
[00:52:45.640 --> 00:52:48.160]   to buckle, they're out of breath, they're tired,
[00:52:48.160 --> 00:52:49.720]   they don't know if they can continue,
[00:52:49.720 --> 00:52:53.960]   and the race seems like it's still so far away.
[00:52:53.960 --> 00:52:57.120]   Can I continue to do this?
[00:52:57.120 --> 00:52:59.840]   In the world, when you see an individual at that state,
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:03.920]   what do we do if you're good friends?
[00:53:03.920 --> 00:53:08.560]   In the world, you can do it.
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:11.600]   Or maybe if you grew up in the church, you'll quote Philippians.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:14.040]   I can do all things.
[00:53:14.040 --> 00:53:17.360]   Put it on your shoes, on your shirt.
[00:53:17.360 --> 00:53:20.040]   Believe in yourself.
[00:53:20.040 --> 00:53:22.680]   You can do it.
[00:53:22.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   Don't let the naysayers get to you.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:25.560]   Don't trust them.
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:28.120]   Whatever you put your mind to, you can achieve.
[00:53:28.120 --> 00:53:31.440]   And you get motivation speakers, you listen to tape or meditation,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:33.320]   because we need to persevere.
[00:53:33.320 --> 00:53:35.440]   And that's the answer that the world is giving.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:42.600]   This is a Christian version of saying, hey, keep your chin up.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.280]   But he's not simply saying, hey, believe in yourself.
[00:53:46.280 --> 00:53:50.160]   Just suck it up and find the strength within.
[00:53:50.160 --> 00:53:53.280]   And if you just discipline harder, if you just work harder,
[00:53:53.280 --> 00:53:55.160]   you can continue.
[00:53:55.160 --> 00:53:59.200]   That's not the point that he's been making.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:04.120]   The point that he's been making is you took your eyes off of Christ.
[00:54:04.120 --> 00:54:08.000]   And that's why he says he's the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:12.040]   You started with Christ, but at some point in your walk with Christ,
[00:54:12.040 --> 00:54:15.360]   you began to just do things yourself, and you ran out of energy.
[00:54:15.360 --> 00:54:17.000]   You're fatigued.
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:21.400]   So the answer is not to go back and try it again and do it harder this time.
[00:54:21.400 --> 00:54:25.200]   He says, no, the reason why you became this to begin with
[00:54:25.200 --> 00:54:29.240]   is because you took your eyes off of Christ.
[00:54:29.240 --> 00:54:34.040]   That's exactly the point that Paul was trying to make in Philippians 3, 3-7,
[00:54:34.040 --> 00:54:39.840]   where Paul says he is dealing with the Judaizers who are saying
[00:54:39.840 --> 00:54:43.800]   that salvation could not be by grace alone.
[00:54:43.800 --> 00:54:46.920]   Yes, we believe in Jesus, but there's a part that we need to play.
[00:54:46.920 --> 00:54:49.680]   And so you still need to be circumcised, and you still need to respect
[00:54:49.680 --> 00:54:51.600]   the Mosaic law.
[00:54:51.600 --> 00:54:56.120]   And Paul is writing to them, and he says, "For we are the true circumcision,
[00:54:56.120 --> 00:54:59.840]   who worship in the Spirit of God in glory in Christ Jesus,
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:04.320]   and put no confidence in the flesh."
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:06.480]   I don't have confidence in my flesh.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   Let's try harder.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:09.400]   Let's be disciplined even more.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:11.600]   You know, he says, "I put no confidence in the flesh,
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:14.640]   although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh.
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:18.960]   If anyone else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more."
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:20.360]   And Paul was not exaggerating.
[00:55:20.360 --> 00:55:25.040]   You know, people may say that and not be true, but Apostle Paul,
[00:55:25.040 --> 00:55:29.280]   there's nobody who is going to go toe-to-toe with law-keeping
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.240]   and his background than Apostle Paul.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.560]   And then he goes on and said, "Let's go.
[00:55:33.560 --> 00:55:36.400]   If you think that that's the path of righteousness, and you think the reason
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.720]   why I'm preaching salvation by grace alone is because somehow I failed
[00:55:40.720 --> 00:55:43.280]   in the law, let me tell you who I am."
[00:55:43.280 --> 00:55:44.200]   And that's what Paul is doing.
[00:55:44.200 --> 00:55:45.040]   He's presenting.
[00:55:45.040 --> 00:55:49.720]   Circumcised on the eighth day, meaning that he's a true Israelite.
[00:55:49.720 --> 00:55:54.760]   He has a covenant symbol on him of the nation of Israel and of the tribe
[00:55:54.760 --> 00:55:56.480]   of Benjamin.
[00:55:56.480 --> 00:56:00.560]   In the nation of Israel, they were, you know, there's a pecking order as to which
[00:56:00.560 --> 00:56:02.280]   tribes were the most prestigious.
[00:56:02.280 --> 00:56:05.080]   What's the most prestigious?
[00:56:05.080 --> 00:56:07.440]   Tribe of Judah, because that was the kingly line.
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:11.280]   But next to the tribe of Judah, the Benjamites were known for two things.
[00:56:11.280 --> 00:56:15.480]   One, if you remember the Book of Judges, the Benjamites were known
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:17.560]   as the mighty warriors.
[00:56:17.560 --> 00:56:20.200]   So they were known to be valiant warriors.
[00:56:20.200 --> 00:56:24.640]   And then two, they were known to be the ones who remained faithful to Judah
[00:56:24.640 --> 00:56:29.240]   when the kingdom split, where the 10 tribes went with one group,
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:34.640]   and the Judah and Benjamites were the only ones who stayed on the side
[00:56:34.640 --> 00:56:36.280]   that was right.
[00:56:36.280 --> 00:56:40.880]   And so to say that he's a Benjamite right off the bat, right?
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.880]   You want to go toe-to-toe, what tribe are you from?
[00:56:43.880 --> 00:56:46.360]   Manasseh?
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:47.760]   Is that where you're from, Manasseh?
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:50.760]   You know what happened to Manasseh, right?
[00:56:50.760 --> 00:56:52.480]   Say, "I'm from the tribe of Benjamin."
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:56.600]   Hebrew of Hebrew, as to the law, a Pharisee.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:02.240]   Pharisees were the ones who took the law and they were OCD about the law, right?
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:06.400]   They took the Sabbath and they said, "Well, we want to make sure that we never
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:07.760]   break the Sabbath, so we're going to..."
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.720]   They added all these other laws, like, "If you do this,
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:15.040]   if you touch this, if you walk this many, you know, steps and you go one step further,
[00:57:15.040 --> 00:57:15.560]   you broke the law."
[00:57:15.560 --> 00:57:20.800]   These were the Pharisees who took the law seriously.
[00:57:20.800 --> 00:57:27.080]   And he says, "You're accusing me that maybe I couldn't find righteousness and that's why
[00:57:27.080 --> 00:57:28.760]   I'm reverting to grace?
[00:57:28.760 --> 00:57:30.040]   I'm a Pharisee."
[00:57:30.040 --> 00:57:33.240]   But Astezeel, are you questioning my passion?
[00:57:33.240 --> 00:57:35.920]   You're questioning my desire?
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:39.360]   Astezeel, persecutor of the church.
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:43.080]   You know, when he said he was a persecutor of the church, you have to remember that during
[00:57:43.080 --> 00:57:49.080]   that period, the Israelites didn't have authority to carry out capital punishment.
[00:57:49.080 --> 00:57:52.360]   So when Stephen was being stoned and they put all their cloaks,
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:56.920]   everybody who stoned Stephen to put their cloak at the feet of Apostle Paul,
[00:57:56.920 --> 00:58:01.560]   who was Saul at that time, basically means that he's going to be responsible for this.
[00:58:01.560 --> 00:58:06.280]   And Apostle Paul basically said, "Yeah, if I go to jail and I die for this, I'm willing.
[00:58:06.280 --> 00:58:08.480]   You're going to question my zeal?
[00:58:08.480 --> 00:58:10.040]   I was a persecutor of the church.
[00:58:10.040 --> 00:58:15.400]   As to righteousness, which is in the law, found blameless."
[00:58:15.400 --> 00:58:19.240]   Now, that's got to be an exaggeration, right?
[00:58:19.240 --> 00:58:22.800]   Yeah, maybe in the eyes of God, but to other Jews, Apostle Paul,
[00:58:22.800 --> 00:58:29.320]   not only was he a Pharisee, he was a direct disciple of Gamaliel,
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:32.000]   the top scholar of Israel.
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:35.960]   And there's rumors that he was already a member of the Sanhedrin.
[00:58:35.960 --> 00:58:39.520]   So it was assumed that he was blameless in the law.
[00:58:39.520 --> 00:58:43.680]   But whatever thing were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss
[00:58:43.680 --> 00:58:46.160]   for the sake of Christ.
[00:58:46.160 --> 00:58:54.040]   If my righteousness is based upon me being zealous and my background and keeping the law
[00:58:54.040 --> 00:58:58.400]   perfectly and said, "You want to go toe to toe, I'll beat all of you."
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:04.280]   But the message of the cross actually makes all of that rubbish.
[00:59:04.280 --> 00:59:07.200]   It's not because we simply need to work harder.
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.160]   It's not simply because we need to be more disciplined.
[00:59:10.160 --> 00:59:14.560]   All of these things are things that we ought to do, but the primary reason why they got
[00:59:14.560 --> 00:59:20.160]   to the point where they were about to quit is because they took their eyes off of Christ.
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:25.440]   They thought at some point that they can do it by their own strength.
[00:59:25.440 --> 00:59:30.160]   You and I all know the story where Jesus tells that you have a tax collector and a Pharisee
[00:59:30.160 --> 00:59:32.840]   who goes up to pray, and the tax collector is praying.
[00:59:32.840 --> 00:59:35.400]   He's like, "Thank God I'm not like them.
[00:59:35.400 --> 00:59:37.480]   I pay my tithes and I obey the law."
[00:59:37.480 --> 00:59:40.440]   And then the tax collector is beating his chest.
[00:59:40.440 --> 00:59:41.920]   And he said, "I'm not worthy of you."
[00:59:41.920 --> 00:59:44.680]   And he says, "Who became righteous?
[00:59:44.680 --> 00:59:45.800]   Whose sins were justified?"
[00:59:45.800 --> 00:59:50.400]   He said, "The tax collector, because he received forgiveness."
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:51.760]   Now, we all know that story.
[00:59:51.760 --> 00:59:57.800]   So in the beginning and justification, we know that we have to be like a tax collector,
[00:59:57.800 --> 01:00:02.320]   beating our chest, recognizing our sin, asking for forgiveness, and remaining humble.
[01:00:02.320 --> 01:00:07.120]   But at some point, after the justification, we come to sanctification, we become right
[01:00:07.120 --> 01:00:09.680]   back to the Pharisees.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:11.000]   I know I have to be justified.
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:13.440]   To be justified, I need to be like a tax collector.
[01:00:13.440 --> 01:00:16.920]   But to be sanctified, I need to be like a Pharisee.
[01:00:16.920 --> 01:00:20.680]   I need to get all my ducks in order, and I need to check off all the boxes.
[01:00:20.680 --> 01:00:22.520]   I need to read the Bible a certain amount.
[01:00:22.520 --> 01:00:26.600]   I need to have all my theology, and I need to witness to so many people, and I need to
[01:00:26.600 --> 01:00:27.960]   do all of these things.
[01:00:27.960 --> 01:00:33.960]   And then we start to measure everybody else based upon these checkoff lists that we have.
[01:00:33.960 --> 01:00:41.160]   And at some point, we forget that we're always the tax collector before Christ.
[01:00:41.160 --> 01:00:46.640]   We're always beating our chest in need of His mercy.
[01:00:46.640 --> 01:00:50.960]   It is not by our own righteousness we are justified.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:55.400]   It is not simply by our own righteousness that we will be sanctified.
[01:00:55.400 --> 01:00:59.320]   And it is not by our own righteousness that we will be glorified.
[01:00:59.320 --> 01:01:03.400]   You know, one of my favorite passages in the New Testament, I think one of the most beautiful
[01:01:03.400 --> 01:01:08.360]   things that Jesus quoted is in Matthew chapter 12, verse 20.
[01:01:08.360 --> 01:01:14.240]   As He is healing the sick, the Pharisees and the scribes are offended that Jesus is performing
[01:01:14.240 --> 01:01:17.680]   miracles on Sabbath.
[01:01:17.680 --> 01:01:21.560]   And instead of forgetting, instead of seeing the miracles, like, "Oh my gosh, this guy,
[01:01:21.560 --> 01:01:22.640]   He heals the sick.
[01:01:22.640 --> 01:01:23.640]   He has power.
[01:01:23.640 --> 01:01:25.160]   He must be the Messiah."
[01:01:25.160 --> 01:01:33.280]   Instead of seeing the miracle and glorifying God, how can you be healing on the Sabbath?
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:39.240]   Jesus in knowing what's in their heart, He says in verse 20, "A battered reed He will
[01:01:39.240 --> 01:01:47.760]   not break off, and a smoldering wick He will not put out until He leads justice to victory."
[01:01:47.760 --> 01:01:50.760]   A battered reed basically is a reed that has been broken.
[01:01:50.760 --> 01:01:52.640]   It's useless.
[01:01:52.640 --> 01:01:56.080]   A smoldering wick is kind of at the end of the candle.
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:59.120]   You know, that's what you light in order for the oil to burn.
[01:01:59.120 --> 01:02:02.720]   A smoldering wick is basically used, it's burned.
[01:02:02.720 --> 01:02:06.600]   So basically He's saying it's worthless.
[01:02:06.600 --> 01:02:07.600]   It's trash.
[01:02:07.600 --> 01:02:11.960]   In any other, any definition, it would be trash.
[01:02:11.960 --> 01:02:14.200]   We wouldn't look at a smoldering wick and say, "Let's salvage that.
[01:02:14.200 --> 01:02:15.200]   We're going to recycle this."
[01:02:15.200 --> 01:02:16.200]   Right?
[01:02:16.200 --> 01:02:19.280]   We're going to floss our teeth.
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:21.800]   We're going to plant things.
[01:02:21.800 --> 01:02:23.520]   There's nothing to be salvaged.
[01:02:23.520 --> 01:02:24.520]   It's just trash.
[01:02:24.520 --> 01:02:29.000]   And so He's using that imagery, saying that He's having compassion.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:36.320]   A lost sinner, really in rebellion against God, He's worse than a smoldering wick and
[01:02:36.320 --> 01:02:37.320]   a broken reed.
[01:02:37.320 --> 01:02:40.240]   A broken reed is not cursing God.
[01:02:40.240 --> 01:02:43.920]   A smoldering wick is not in rebellion.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:50.880]   But He's saying that even if that is the case, He says, "I will not put it out."
[01:02:50.880 --> 01:02:55.480]   I think it's one of the most beautiful scenes, beautiful things that Jesus has ever said.
[01:02:55.480 --> 01:02:59.920]   And it's His way of saying that, "I will not turn away, ever turn away a repentant
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:01.920]   sinner.
[01:03:01.920 --> 01:03:07.760]   I will never turn away a genuinely repentant sinner."
[01:03:07.760 --> 01:03:11.880]   And that's what He means when He says, Hebrews chapter 12, verse 3, "For consider Him who
[01:03:11.880 --> 01:03:16.720]   has endured such hostility by sinners against Himself, so that you will not grow weary and
[01:03:16.720 --> 01:03:17.880]   lose heart."
[01:03:17.880 --> 01:03:19.080]   So let me stop right there.
[01:03:19.080 --> 01:03:20.760]   Look at that text.
[01:03:20.760 --> 01:03:28.000]   You look at that and say, He endured hostility so that we will not grow weary.
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:33.400]   Does He mean that He set an example for us of persevering?
[01:03:33.400 --> 01:03:37.200]   And even though He was being attacked, He endured, so therefore He set an example.
[01:03:37.200 --> 01:03:41.680]   And so we need to follow that example that in the midst of persecution that we need to
[01:03:41.680 --> 01:03:44.720]   persevere as well?
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:48.440]   Possibly, right?
[01:03:48.440 --> 01:03:50.000]   Possibly.
[01:03:50.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   I believe the main thrust of what He's saying here is that in the context of being weary
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:04.160]   and losing heart and arms drooping and knees buckling, He says, "Jesus has accomplished
[01:04:04.160 --> 01:04:07.760]   what you could not do."
[01:04:07.760 --> 01:04:11.520]   He endured hostility against sinners against Himself.
[01:04:11.520 --> 01:04:12.520]   What does that mean?
[01:04:12.520 --> 01:04:15.800]   He went to the cross.
[01:04:15.800 --> 01:04:22.560]   Despite the suffering, despite the rejection, despite the pain, He said He went to the cross
[01:04:22.560 --> 01:04:27.920]   so that when we are weary, that we do not need to quit.
[01:04:27.920 --> 01:04:31.300]   Because God's not placing that on our shoulder that you better get your act straight.
[01:04:31.300 --> 01:04:32.300]   You better do this.
[01:04:32.300 --> 01:04:33.800]   He says no.
[01:04:33.800 --> 01:04:36.880]   Because He knew we were going to be weak.
[01:04:36.880 --> 01:04:39.720]   He knew there are times that we're going to be drooping arms.
[01:04:39.720 --> 01:04:42.200]   We're going to have buckling knees.
[01:04:42.200 --> 01:04:45.840]   He says He endured for us so that you would not lose heart.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:50.280]   In other words, to look to Christ.
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:55.360]   That when those situations happen, that we do not look to people, we do not look to leaders,
[01:04:55.360 --> 01:05:01.840]   we do not look to circumstances or community or finance or politics.
[01:05:01.840 --> 01:05:11.040]   To fix your eyes upon Christ, the beginner and the finisher of our faith.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:15.840]   Romans chapter 8, 26 to 28 says, in the same way the Spirit also helps our weakness.
[01:05:15.840 --> 01:05:20.080]   For we do not know how to pray as we should, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with
[01:05:20.080 --> 01:05:22.680]   groanings too deep for words.
[01:05:22.680 --> 01:05:30.620]   Man, this passage is always so encouraging to me because even in our prayers, He says
[01:05:30.620 --> 01:05:34.600]   when you can't pray, I know I commanded you to pray.
[01:05:34.600 --> 01:05:36.320]   I know how important prayer is.
[01:05:36.320 --> 01:05:43.440]   But even when you can't pray and you don't know what to pray for, He provided for us.
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:47.680]   The Spirit inside of us interceding and He who searches the hearts knows what the mind
[01:05:47.680 --> 01:05:51.880]   of the Spirit is because He intercedes for the saints according to the will of God.
[01:05:51.880 --> 01:05:56.840]   And we know that God causes all things to work together for good to those who love God,
[01:05:56.840 --> 01:06:01.440]   to those who are called according to His purpose.
[01:06:01.440 --> 01:06:12.700]   He even provided knowing that there are times where we're going to have a hard time praying.
[01:06:12.700 --> 01:06:13.880]   We don't know what to pray for.
[01:06:13.880 --> 01:06:14.880]   We're lost.
[01:06:14.880 --> 01:06:15.880]   What is God's will?
[01:06:15.880 --> 01:06:23.080]   That even in that context, He says, I made it so that the Holy Spirit will groan with
[01:06:23.080 --> 01:06:26.300]   words that even you don't understand.
[01:06:26.300 --> 01:06:31.160]   So that there the Holy Spirit is interceding on our behalf even when we are struggling.
[01:06:31.160 --> 01:06:33.960]   Man, He thought of everything.
[01:06:33.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   Everything.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:41.120]   He didn't just justify us and then said, you better get to work.
[01:06:41.120 --> 01:06:44.560]   He didn't just justify us and say, now everything, I've done everything I could, now you just
[01:06:44.560 --> 01:06:45.560]   go to it.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:47.720]   He said, no.
[01:06:47.720 --> 01:06:51.440]   He who started a good work in you, He will carry it onto completion.
[01:06:51.440 --> 01:06:54.520]   And He says, all things work together for good.
[01:06:54.520 --> 01:06:55.940]   For who?
[01:06:55.940 --> 01:06:59.940]   For those who are the most disciplined, for those who have the best theology, for those
[01:06:59.940 --> 01:07:01.400]   who have proven track record.
[01:07:01.400 --> 01:07:07.600]   No, He said, for those who have been called and for those who love Him.
[01:07:07.600 --> 01:07:09.880]   Are you justified?
[01:07:09.880 --> 01:07:12.120]   And do you love Him?
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:18.320]   So the most important question that a Christian should be continually asking is, do I love
[01:07:18.320 --> 01:07:21.040]   Him?
[01:07:21.040 --> 01:07:23.040]   That's the greatest commandment.
[01:07:23.040 --> 01:07:25.800]   And that's the measuring stick that God uses.
[01:07:25.800 --> 01:07:30.920]   And He says, if you are justified and if you love Him, all things will work together for
[01:07:30.920 --> 01:07:33.740]   good according to His purpose.
[01:07:33.740 --> 01:07:35.360]   He will do it.
[01:07:35.360 --> 01:07:41.360]   See, our struggle is, we have a tendency.
[01:07:41.360 --> 01:07:46.880]   And it's proof that maybe we haven't really truly even died yet.
[01:07:46.880 --> 01:07:53.660]   We have a tendency to live up to the expectations of people rather than the calling of the gospel.
[01:07:53.660 --> 01:07:57.920]   So we jump through hoops and do what we need to do because that's expected of us from our
[01:07:57.920 --> 01:07:59.800]   community.
[01:07:59.800 --> 01:08:03.380]   Maybe our leaders, our friends, our family members.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:07.140]   You know who is under that pressure more than anybody else?
[01:08:07.140 --> 01:08:09.020]   Right here.
[01:08:09.020 --> 01:08:10.220]   Me.
[01:08:10.220 --> 01:08:12.340]   And then the other pastors.
[01:08:12.340 --> 01:08:13.340]   Then the elders.
[01:08:13.340 --> 01:08:15.680]   The small group leaders.
[01:08:15.680 --> 01:08:18.220]   Anybody who leads is under that pressure.
[01:08:18.220 --> 01:08:19.220]   You don't have to be a leader.
[01:08:19.220 --> 01:08:20.220]   You just have to be a Christian.
[01:08:20.220 --> 01:08:22.060]   You're a member of the church.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:23.060]   You know?
[01:08:23.060 --> 01:08:30.600]   So we live up to the expectations of what other people think we ought to be rather than
[01:08:30.600 --> 01:08:35.980]   living up to the calling that God has given us as His children.
[01:08:35.980 --> 01:08:40.300]   So what ends up happening is we become experts in presenting ourselves.
[01:08:40.300 --> 01:08:43.580]   The longer you've been a Christian, you know the knee-jerk answer.
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.580]   How are you doing?
[01:08:45.580 --> 01:08:46.580]   Good.
[01:08:46.580 --> 01:08:47.580]   Right?
[01:08:47.580 --> 01:08:50.860]   Struggling but getting better.
[01:08:50.860 --> 01:08:52.240]   Right?
[01:08:52.240 --> 01:08:57.540]   We have these generic things that deep inside is like, "Man, I'm about to die."
[01:08:57.540 --> 01:09:00.460]   I've been hooked on pornography for months.
[01:09:00.460 --> 01:09:03.260]   But the way we answer is like, "Struggling."
[01:09:03.260 --> 01:09:04.260]   Right?
[01:09:04.260 --> 01:09:05.820]   It's just struggling.
[01:09:05.820 --> 01:09:06.820]   Because we know.
[01:09:06.820 --> 01:09:08.840]   We know how to get along.
[01:09:08.840 --> 01:09:10.660]   We know how to function.
[01:09:10.660 --> 01:09:11.780]   Right?
[01:09:11.780 --> 01:09:18.820]   And so when that begins to break down and we start the hypocrisy of a double life that
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:25.220]   we're living and all of a sudden either that causes us to repent and get right with God
[01:09:25.220 --> 01:09:29.420]   or we go through deconstruction saying maybe it's their fault.
[01:09:29.420 --> 01:09:33.260]   Maybe I'm in this situation because they were the ones who put that pressure on me and then
[01:09:33.260 --> 01:09:36.020]   I try to live up to their standard because they started judging me.
[01:09:36.020 --> 01:09:37.740]   They told me I need to do this.
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:46.420]   Not realizing maybe from the get-go we were founded upon the wrong foundation.
[01:09:46.420 --> 01:09:48.340]   You know there's a song from Twilight Paris.
[01:09:48.340 --> 01:09:53.020]   I don't think she is famous anymore but she was at one point and has a song called "Warrior
[01:09:53.020 --> 01:09:55.420]   is a Child."
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:57.860]   And this song, I wanted to read it to you.
[01:09:57.860 --> 01:10:02.660]   It says, "Lately I've been winning battles left and right but even winners can get wounded
[01:10:02.660 --> 01:10:04.420]   in the fight.
[01:10:04.420 --> 01:10:08.260]   People say that I'm amazing, I'm strong beyond my years but they don't see inside of me I'm
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:11.260]   hiding all my tears.
[01:10:11.260 --> 01:10:15.620]   I don't know that I come, they don't know that I come running home when I fall down.
[01:10:15.620 --> 01:10:19.020]   They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[01:10:19.020 --> 01:10:25.220]   I drop my sword and cry for just a while because deep inside this armor the warrior is a child.
[01:10:25.220 --> 01:10:30.020]   Unafraid because his armor is the best but even soldiers need a quiet place to rest.
[01:10:30.020 --> 01:10:34.940]   People say that I'm amazing, I never face retreat but they don't see the enemies that
[01:10:34.940 --> 01:10:37.160]   lay me at his feet.
[01:10:37.160 --> 01:10:39.520]   They don't know that I come running home when I fall down.
[01:10:39.520 --> 01:10:42.320]   They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[01:10:42.320 --> 01:10:51.140]   I drop my sword and cry for just a while because deep inside this armor the warrior is a child."
[01:10:51.140 --> 01:10:55.440]   How many of you can relate to this song?
[01:10:55.440 --> 01:11:02.240]   We try so hard to present ourselves a certain way because we think that this is what we
[01:11:02.240 --> 01:11:05.220]   ought to do.
[01:11:05.220 --> 01:11:11.780]   And so you do that for a year, two years, four years, five years and then the pressure
[01:11:11.780 --> 01:11:17.700]   begins to buckle because we're not standing on Christ.
[01:11:17.700 --> 01:11:23.660]   So when he says if your arms are drooping and your knees are buckling, that's what he's
[01:11:23.660 --> 01:11:26.900]   been trying to do, to fix your eyes upon Christ.
[01:11:26.900 --> 01:11:29.220]   To fix it upon Christ.
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:34.360]   The reason why the Hebrews were in the position they were isn't simply because they weren't
[01:11:34.360 --> 01:11:36.260]   trying hard enough.
[01:11:36.260 --> 01:11:40.080]   It's because they forgot.
[01:11:40.080 --> 01:11:44.500]   They forgot what brought them to Christ to begin with.
[01:11:44.500 --> 01:11:49.160]   They forgot that they were the bruised reed.
[01:11:49.160 --> 01:11:53.860]   That they were the burned wick.
[01:11:53.860 --> 01:12:00.980]   And it isn't until you and I recognize from beginning to the middle to the end that we
[01:12:00.980 --> 01:12:07.760]   will always be a burnt out wick that is desperately in need of his grace.
[01:12:07.760 --> 01:12:12.720]   We are always tax collectors beating our chest in need of his mercy.
[01:12:12.720 --> 01:12:15.720]   And until then, we don't need Christ.
[01:12:15.720 --> 01:12:18.480]   We've been justified so we don't need Christ.
[01:12:18.480 --> 01:12:21.160]   My ticket's in heaven already so we don't need Christ.
[01:12:21.160 --> 01:12:22.440]   I'm going to use my intellect.
[01:12:22.440 --> 01:12:23.440]   I'm going to try hard.
[01:12:23.440 --> 01:12:24.440]   I'm going to be more disciplined.
[01:12:24.440 --> 01:12:26.780]   I'm going to read more than other people.
[01:12:26.780 --> 01:12:31.720]   And so since I'm justified, I'm just going to be better.
[01:12:31.720 --> 01:12:37.320]   It's probably that very reason why they started to drift back to begin with.
[01:12:37.320 --> 01:12:40.760]   But here's the kicker in verse 13.
[01:12:40.760 --> 01:12:45.360]   He says, "And make straight paths for your feet so that the limb which is lame may not
[01:12:45.360 --> 01:12:47.720]   be put out of joint but rather be healed."
[01:12:47.720 --> 01:12:51.840]   So you see this imagery of the race that he uses again.
[01:12:51.840 --> 01:12:56.120]   Here's that man who's running and he's about to quit and he says, "Here's the solution.
[01:12:56.120 --> 01:12:57.120]   Strengthen that."
[01:12:57.120 --> 01:12:58.640]   In other words, get back up.
[01:12:58.640 --> 01:13:01.120]   And then he says, "Here's what you need to do.
[01:13:01.120 --> 01:13:03.000]   Make the straight path straight for your feet."
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.960]   So imagery-wise, it makes sense, right?
[01:13:05.960 --> 01:13:11.160]   If you're going to run this path, you need to make sure that you're on the right path.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:15.400]   But again, you have to understand that a first century Jew, when you talked about a straight
[01:13:15.400 --> 01:13:21.000]   path, there's an immediate understanding of what they were referring to.
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:27.800]   Like today, if I asked you, "What are the best streets in this area?"
[01:13:27.800 --> 01:13:32.000]   What are the streets that you feel like you can take a car and just go as fast as you
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:34.680]   can, not that you should?
[01:13:34.680 --> 01:13:35.720]   But what are the best streets?
[01:13:35.720 --> 01:13:40.600]   What are the streets that they pay the most attention to, to make sure that there's no
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:46.720]   potholes, there's no quick turns, that you can get on that street and go straight and
[01:13:46.720 --> 01:13:51.560]   step on it and you're going to be able to be safe going on that street?
[01:13:51.560 --> 01:13:53.520]   What road is that way?
[01:13:53.520 --> 01:13:54.760]   Right?
[01:13:54.760 --> 01:13:55.880]   Jamboree?
[01:13:55.880 --> 01:13:58.200]   No, it's not Jamboree.
[01:13:58.200 --> 01:14:02.160]   There's too many pedestrians there, right?
[01:14:02.160 --> 01:14:06.160]   And there's certain cities you have a pot, you know, like a, what do you call it, hole
[01:14:06.160 --> 01:14:07.160]   in the ground?
[01:14:07.160 --> 01:14:08.160]   >>Potholes.
[01:14:08.160 --> 01:14:11.440]   >>Potholes, yes.
[01:14:11.440 --> 01:14:14.320]   It may not be fixed for a while, right?
[01:14:14.320 --> 01:14:17.960]   You just drive slow and then you just have to be careful.
[01:14:17.960 --> 01:14:21.640]   But you will never see a pothole on the freeway.
[01:14:21.640 --> 01:14:26.440]   Because if you have a pothole on the freeway, people can die.
[01:14:26.440 --> 01:14:30.080]   And you won't see the freeway turning real quick.
[01:14:30.080 --> 01:14:33.240]   All the best roads are on the highway.
[01:14:33.240 --> 01:14:38.920]   And they, if any, even an object is on the highway, somebody will come, the CHP officers
[01:14:38.920 --> 01:14:42.340]   will come and they'll clear that out because it's dangerous.
[01:14:42.340 --> 01:14:45.960]   So the best roads around us are always the highways.
[01:14:45.960 --> 01:14:49.320]   They're the biggest roads, they're the safest, they're the flattest, and they pay the most
[01:14:49.320 --> 01:14:50.720]   attention to that.
[01:14:50.720 --> 01:14:54.440]   You know what the best roads were in Israel?
[01:14:54.440 --> 01:15:00.720]   All the best roads in Israel were the roads that led to the cities of refuge.
[01:15:00.720 --> 01:15:05.160]   The cities of refuge, if you didn't know, were six cities that were commanded by God
[01:15:05.160 --> 01:15:09.640]   that as they entered into the promised land, and they were spread out in Israel in the
[01:15:09.640 --> 01:15:14.520]   six places so that any part of Israel you couldn't look up because they were built on
[01:15:14.520 --> 01:15:18.720]   hills and you were able to visually see where they were.
[01:15:18.720 --> 01:15:22.680]   And you knew that if anything happened, you needed to run there, you knew exactly which
[01:15:22.680 --> 01:15:25.000]   city to go to.
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:34.240]   So the reason why he did that, he said that if somebody is like plowing or farming and
[01:15:34.240 --> 01:15:43.160]   accidentally he kills his neighbor, and so the neighbor's family member who becomes angry
[01:15:43.160 --> 01:15:48.160]   that their brother or sister or father was killed, even though it was accidentally, that
[01:15:48.160 --> 01:15:49.880]   they want to take vengeance.
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:53.480]   And so they call that individual avenger of blood.
[01:15:53.480 --> 01:15:57.000]   And so when that avenger of blood wants to take vengeance on that individual who killed
[01:15:57.000 --> 01:16:01.800]   accidentally, that he would pack up his stuff and run to the city of refuge as soon as he
[01:16:01.800 --> 01:16:08.280]   can and then when he gets to the gate, they would have a trial to see if it was accidental,
[01:16:08.280 --> 01:16:11.640]   if he is innocent, that he didn't deliberately murder this person.
[01:16:11.640 --> 01:16:17.080]   And if that's found to be true, they would open the door and the one who was fleeing,
[01:16:17.080 --> 01:16:22.400]   would enter into the city and the city was run by the priests.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:25.120]   And the leader of these cities were the high priest.
[01:16:25.120 --> 01:16:29.040]   So under the protection of the high priest, the avenger of blood could not get to him
[01:16:29.040 --> 01:16:32.840]   and that's where he would live out the rest of his life in order so that the avenger of
[01:16:32.840 --> 01:16:35.600]   blood would not get to him.
[01:16:35.600 --> 01:16:37.140]   Now think about that.
[01:16:37.140 --> 01:16:40.000]   How often do you think this happened in Israel?
[01:16:40.000 --> 01:16:44.440]   That he would establish six cities, right?
[01:16:44.440 --> 01:16:45.440]   How often does that happen?
[01:16:45.440 --> 01:16:48.720]   How often does accidental killing happen in our community?
[01:16:48.720 --> 01:16:50.880]   I mean, our cities are much more dense.
[01:16:50.880 --> 01:16:52.160]   I mean, it can happen, right?
[01:16:52.160 --> 01:16:54.280]   Car accidents, but they didn't ride cars back then.
[01:16:54.280 --> 01:16:58.360]   So typically if they killed somebody by accident, it was probably they're, you know, throwing
[01:16:58.360 --> 01:17:02.960]   the whole back and then they hit somebody in the back of the head or something.
[01:17:02.960 --> 01:17:07.360]   Or they were getting carried away with their cows and they ran over somebody.
[01:17:07.360 --> 01:17:09.800]   How often does this happen?
[01:17:09.800 --> 01:17:14.640]   That he would, and it's mentioned in Deuteronomy, it's mentioned in the book of Numbers, it's
[01:17:14.640 --> 01:17:19.360]   mentioned in Joshua and Exodus, it's mentioned in all these.
[01:17:19.360 --> 01:17:27.520]   This was significant enough that he has six cities, all this money dedicated just so that
[01:17:27.520 --> 01:17:29.520]   they can have, if that ever happens.
[01:17:29.520 --> 01:17:34.280]   And my guess is it was pretty rare that that even happened.
[01:17:34.280 --> 01:17:35.360]   So why was this there?
[01:17:35.360 --> 01:17:41.680]   Why was so much attention given to these six cities of refuge?
[01:17:41.680 --> 01:17:48.040]   Every one of these cities was a visual reminder of the coming of Christ.
[01:17:48.040 --> 01:17:54.680]   Next time you read the New Testament, see how often the word refuge is related to God.
[01:17:54.680 --> 01:17:59.800]   How often you see the term refuge as Christ being our refuge.
[01:17:59.800 --> 01:18:05.800]   All of this was an example as Christ, as our high priest, protects us from the avenger
[01:18:05.800 --> 01:18:06.800]   of blood.
[01:18:06.800 --> 01:18:14.200]   All of this to point to that when Christ comes, that he will be our refuge.
[01:18:14.200 --> 01:18:21.680]   And so the Bible says in the book of Deuteronomy that all the roads have to be paved well so
[01:18:21.680 --> 01:18:26.520]   that if this happened, the best roads in Israel would always lead to the cities of refuge.
[01:18:26.520 --> 01:18:34.340]   In fact, in the rabbinical tradition written by Josephus, the first century Jewish historian,
[01:18:34.340 --> 01:18:42.920]   he says it was well known that the best roads in Israel all led to the cities of refuge.
[01:18:42.920 --> 01:18:51.120]   In fact, every year it was part of their law to clear out these roads in case it got damaged,
[01:18:51.120 --> 01:18:55.240]   in case there were potholes, in case there were, you know, like they had a flood and
[01:18:55.240 --> 01:18:56.920]   the road was wiped out.
[01:18:56.920 --> 01:19:01.440]   Every year they had to go revisit, make sure that these roads were clear and it was flat.
[01:19:01.440 --> 01:19:04.280]   They built bridges, right?
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:07.600]   Even on the roads that are rarely traveled, they would build bridges to make sure that
[01:19:07.600 --> 01:19:11.760]   just in case if that happened, that an individual was running would have the clearest and the
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:14.400]   fastest path to the cities of refuge.
[01:19:14.400 --> 01:19:18.640]   And then on top of that, to make sure that the people who are on this path would not
[01:19:18.640 --> 01:19:24.680]   get lost, they put signposts every so often so that as they are running, they are reminded
[01:19:24.680 --> 01:19:26.440]   that they are on the right road.
[01:19:26.440 --> 01:19:32.840]   So on these signs, it would say, "Refuge, refuge, refuge, refuge."
[01:19:32.840 --> 01:19:39.120]   So first century Jew, when he reads this, "And make straight path for your feet," the
[01:19:39.120 --> 01:19:45.980]   first imagery that he has is the cities of refuge that leads to Christ.
[01:19:45.980 --> 01:19:55.220]   And it is in this backdrop that Christ comes to fulfill what he's been preparing, that
[01:19:55.220 --> 01:19:56.220]   he is our refuge.
[01:19:56.220 --> 01:19:57.220]   He is our strength.
[01:19:57.220 --> 01:20:01.540]   The refuge means when you are at that point where you're about to quit, that you don't
[01:20:01.540 --> 01:20:07.140]   have any strength to lift up your arms and your knees are beginning to buckle.
[01:20:07.140 --> 01:20:16.100]   The only refuge that can truly protect us, where we can find life, is in Christ.
[01:20:16.100 --> 01:20:21.300]   That's why in Isaiah chapter 40, verse 3 to 4, in the prophecy about the coming Christ,
[01:20:21.300 --> 01:20:26.620]   he says, "A voice is calling, 'Clear the way for the Lord in the wilderness.
[01:20:26.620 --> 01:20:29.420]   Make smooth path in the desert a highway for our God.
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:34.520]   Let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low and let the rough ground
[01:20:34.520 --> 01:20:38.220]   become a plain and the rugged terrain a broad valley."
[01:20:38.220 --> 01:20:43.020]   This was a prophecy about the Messiah coming.
[01:20:43.020 --> 01:20:47.220]   And this is exactly how John the Baptist's ministry is described in Mark chapter 2, verse
[01:20:47.220 --> 01:20:48.220]   3.
[01:20:48.220 --> 01:20:52.540]   As it is written in Isaiah the prophet, "Behold, I send my messenger ahead of you who will
[01:20:52.540 --> 01:20:53.540]   prepare your way.
[01:20:53.540 --> 01:20:57.620]   The voice of one crying in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord.
[01:20:57.620 --> 01:21:00.940]   Make his path straight.'"
[01:21:00.940 --> 01:21:06.780]   So the primary ministry of John the Baptist was to pave the road so that the access to
[01:21:06.780 --> 01:21:10.700]   the Messiah would be the fastest and the best.
[01:21:10.700 --> 01:21:15.400]   You know, that's the ministry of every minister.
[01:21:15.400 --> 01:21:21.860]   My calling in ministry is not so that I can know what the latest trend is in our culture
[01:21:21.860 --> 01:21:27.800]   and tap into that and find all the business ideas that we can implement in the church
[01:21:27.800 --> 01:21:32.860]   that will be the best organized and get the best money to do the best things.
[01:21:32.860 --> 01:21:36.540]   And I remember early on in ministry just being burned out by all of that because it was just
[01:21:36.540 --> 01:21:37.540]   overwhelming.
[01:21:37.540 --> 01:21:42.420]   And it dawned on me, God never called me to do that.
[01:21:42.420 --> 01:21:44.940]   That was the expectation of maybe the church.
[01:21:44.940 --> 01:21:49.020]   That was an expectation from the Christian culture.
[01:21:49.020 --> 01:21:51.260]   But I didn't see that in Scripture.
[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:56.740]   He deliberately picked fishermen who knew nothing.
[01:21:56.740 --> 01:22:02.340]   I mean, if he wanted wise, smart people to build his first church, he picked the wrong
[01:22:02.340 --> 01:22:03.340]   people.
[01:22:03.340 --> 01:22:09.420]   In fact, when the Corinthians began to divide one another because they were so smart, he
[01:22:09.420 --> 01:22:12.860]   reminds them, "God chose you because you were dumb."
[01:22:12.860 --> 01:22:15.740]   That's my translation.
[01:22:15.740 --> 01:22:18.380]   You weren't that great.
[01:22:18.380 --> 01:22:21.620]   And now you're trying to be one up on another, and that's what's causing this division, all
[01:22:21.620 --> 01:22:22.620]   kinds of trouble.
[01:22:22.620 --> 01:22:28.460]   As I was reading through Scripture, I was like, "Oh, I don't need to be that smart.
[01:22:28.460 --> 01:22:29.900]   I don't need to be that clever.
[01:22:29.900 --> 01:22:31.220]   I don't need to be that talented."
[01:22:31.220 --> 01:22:37.720]   The primary thing that he called me to do is to make the path straight, to make the
[01:22:37.720 --> 01:22:44.140]   access to God as easy as possible, and to constantly remind people where the city of
[01:22:44.140 --> 01:22:46.460]   refuge is.
[01:22:46.460 --> 01:22:47.580]   It's not in your homes.
[01:22:47.580 --> 01:22:49.140]   It's not in your neighbors.
[01:22:49.140 --> 01:22:51.720]   It's not in your community, small group.
[01:22:51.720 --> 01:22:53.260]   It's not in your husband.
[01:22:53.260 --> 01:22:54.260]   It's not in your wife.
[01:22:54.260 --> 01:22:56.780]   It's not in your children.
[01:22:56.780 --> 01:23:00.820]   City of refuge is in Christ.
[01:23:00.820 --> 01:23:06.100]   And this is the same message I give every single Sunday, right?
[01:23:06.100 --> 01:23:12.340]   Different highlights, different passage, but it's the same message.
[01:23:12.340 --> 01:23:15.020]   Don't drift from Christ.
[01:23:15.020 --> 01:23:18.860]   And I've made it very plain to you that I don't trust you.
[01:23:18.860 --> 01:23:21.140]   I don't trust you.
[01:23:21.140 --> 01:23:26.140]   And I've asked you, "Don't trust me," because you're a sinner like me, and I'm a sinner
[01:23:26.140 --> 01:23:28.280]   like you.
[01:23:28.280 --> 01:23:31.060]   Everything you struggle with, I struggle with.
[01:23:31.060 --> 01:23:37.300]   But the only reason why I'm here is to show you, to highlight.
[01:23:37.300 --> 01:23:43.900]   It's kind of like God has given me a high beam to shed light on this road.
[01:23:43.900 --> 01:23:46.940]   That's the road we're supposed to take.
[01:23:46.940 --> 01:23:49.520]   That's who we're supposed to go to.
[01:23:49.520 --> 01:23:51.600]   That's where our living water is.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:54.180]   That's where our bread is.
[01:23:54.180 --> 01:23:56.920]   You could be disappointed with me.
[01:23:56.920 --> 01:24:00.080]   You could be disappointed with this church.
[01:24:00.080 --> 01:24:04.040]   But that does not change who Christ is in your life.
[01:24:04.040 --> 01:24:10.400]   In Psalm 46, 1 to 3, God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
[01:24:10.400 --> 01:24:14.940]   Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth should change and though the mountains slip
[01:24:14.940 --> 01:24:20.180]   into the heart of the sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake
[01:24:20.180 --> 01:24:26.940]   at its swelling pride, though your arms are drooping, though your knees are buckling,
[01:24:26.940 --> 01:24:30.280]   God is our refuge and He is our strength.
[01:24:30.280 --> 01:24:37.560]   Not only are we to run this race with perseverance, He says, "Help one another," Hebrews 10,
[01:24:37.560 --> 01:24:39.400]   20 through 25.
[01:24:39.400 --> 01:24:45.020]   Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering, for He who promised is faithful.
[01:24:45.020 --> 01:24:48.240]   Let us consider how to stimulate one another unto our love and good deeds, not forsaking
[01:24:48.240 --> 01:24:52.000]   our own assembly together as it is the habit of some, but encouraging one another all the
[01:24:52.000 --> 01:24:55.240]   more as you see the day drawing near.
[01:24:55.240 --> 01:25:00.020]   Not only are we called to be on this path, the purpose of the church, we gather together
[01:25:00.020 --> 01:25:02.840]   as a team to encourage each other.
[01:25:02.840 --> 01:25:11.400]   It's kind of like if you signed up on a marathon where you are running together as a team.
[01:25:11.400 --> 01:25:13.860]   Some of you run faster.
[01:25:13.860 --> 01:25:18.360]   Some of you are like me, don't run at all, right?
[01:25:18.360 --> 01:25:22.160]   But you signed up and you want to get, we all want to get to the cities of refuge.
[01:25:22.160 --> 01:25:26.520]   That's the end goal, right?
[01:25:26.520 --> 01:25:33.720]   So in this process, the calling in the church is that some of those who are faster to encourage
[01:25:33.720 --> 01:25:38.680]   those who are slower to keep up, to strengthen them.
[01:25:38.680 --> 01:25:41.480]   Maybe slow down a little bit so they can catch up.
[01:25:41.480 --> 01:25:44.520]   Maybe right now he's the one who needs the water, right?
[01:25:44.520 --> 01:25:48.880]   Maybe we need to take a water break and to make sure that we are running this together,
[01:25:48.880 --> 01:25:49.920]   right?
[01:25:49.920 --> 01:25:54.920]   And those who are a little bit slower to be challenged by those who are a bit faster.
[01:25:54.920 --> 01:25:58.760]   But imagine if we're running together and the guy in the front is like, "What the heck
[01:25:58.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   is wrong with you?
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:05.800]   We're running at this speed and you're not coming along.
[01:26:05.800 --> 01:26:08.600]   What is wrong with you?"
[01:26:08.600 --> 01:26:14.520]   Imagine what kind of a team we would be in, what kind of a church we would be if the fastest
[01:26:14.520 --> 01:26:19.640]   runners are always yelling at the slow runners that they're not keeping up.
[01:26:19.640 --> 01:26:21.720]   So you know what ends up happening?
[01:26:21.720 --> 01:26:26.680]   The slow runners are so discouraged that, "I can't keep up.
[01:26:26.680 --> 01:26:31.480]   I'm ruining this team, so I'm just not going to run."
[01:26:31.480 --> 01:26:38.040]   And the fastest runners are so frustrated that they're not running fast enough and there's
[01:26:38.040 --> 01:26:43.440]   no way that he could possibly win on this team, so he ends up quitting.
[01:26:43.440 --> 01:26:47.480]   And then the ones who are running at the medium speed, keeping up with everybody, now that
[01:26:47.480 --> 01:26:54.640]   the fastest runners are gone and the slowest runners have quit, they're disqualified.
[01:26:54.640 --> 01:26:59.080]   So they all quit.
[01:26:59.080 --> 01:27:03.080]   God calls us together to stay on this path.
[01:27:03.080 --> 01:27:04.840]   Those who are stronger, encourage the weak.
[01:27:04.840 --> 01:27:08.280]   Those who are weak, be challenged by those who are stronger and make sure that we're
[01:27:08.280 --> 01:27:09.680]   running this race together.
[01:27:09.680 --> 01:27:14.760]   That's what Hebrews 10, 23 to 25 is, for people who are frustrated and ready to go their own
[01:27:14.760 --> 01:27:15.760]   path.
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:20.600]   That's why the primary greetings in the early church was "Maranatha."
[01:27:20.600 --> 01:27:22.800]   You know what Maranatha means?
[01:27:22.800 --> 01:27:25.120]   The Lord is coming.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:26.120]   The Lord comes.
[01:27:26.120 --> 01:27:32.160]   That's what they kept on reminding each other because Maranatha is where we find the greatest
[01:27:32.160 --> 01:27:33.160]   comfort.
[01:27:33.160 --> 01:27:35.280]   Maranatha is where we find our greatest strength.
[01:27:35.280 --> 01:27:43.120]   Maranatha is where we find our greatest fuel so that those who are with drooping hands,
[01:27:43.120 --> 01:27:47.600]   those who have buckling knees, would find strength, refuge, and comfort needed to persevere
[01:27:47.600 --> 01:27:48.600]   in this race.
[01:27:48.600 --> 01:27:50.800]   And that's why they said Maranatha.
[01:27:50.800 --> 01:27:52.160]   Lord is coming.
[01:27:52.160 --> 01:27:56.200]   I know you're tired, but Maranatha, he's coming.
[01:27:56.200 --> 01:27:57.880]   I know you're discouraged.
[01:27:57.880 --> 01:28:00.000]   Maranatha, he's coming.
[01:28:00.000 --> 01:28:03.840]   I know you're frustrated and you're hurt.
[01:28:03.840 --> 01:28:07.680]   I know you have past pains that you just can't erase from your head.
[01:28:07.680 --> 01:28:11.200]   Maranatha, he's coming.
[01:28:11.200 --> 01:28:14.760]   Some of you are in situations where you've been trying to shake bad memories from your
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:21.840]   past for years and sometimes you feel like you're making progress, sometimes you're digressing.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:25.120]   Maranatha, he's coming.
[01:28:25.120 --> 01:28:26.960]   He's coming.
[01:28:26.960 --> 01:28:33.680]   No matter how hard this gets, no matter how discouraged we get, no Christian has a reason
[01:28:33.680 --> 01:28:35.280]   to quit.
[01:28:35.280 --> 01:28:36.640]   Persevere.
[01:28:36.640 --> 01:28:39.280]   Maranatha, he's coming.
[01:28:39.280 --> 01:28:45.680]   Let's pray.
[01:28:45.680 --> 01:28:50.200]   Let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord in prayer.
[01:28:50.200 --> 01:28:53.080]   Again, ask the Lord.
[01:28:53.080 --> 01:28:55.760]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[01:28:55.760 --> 01:28:57.880]   Lord, I drifted from you.
[01:28:57.880 --> 01:29:02.760]   I've been working and running so hard and I'm tired.
[01:29:02.760 --> 01:29:05.920]   I'm that person in verse 12.
[01:29:05.920 --> 01:29:08.000]   I need to make the path straight.
[01:29:08.000 --> 01:29:10.000]   I need to come to the Lord.
[01:29:10.000 --> 01:29:14.160]   Help me.
[01:29:14.160 --> 01:29:20.520]   Effective prayer is not flowery words or many words or even the intensity, but just the
[01:29:20.520 --> 01:29:22.080]   honesty before God.
[01:29:22.080 --> 01:29:30.080]   Come before the Lord and take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[01:29:30.080 --> 01:29:36.080]   Let's pray.
[01:29:36.080 --> 01:29:38.660]   (gentle music)
[01:29:38.660 --> 01:29:42.080]   (gentle music continues)

[01:31:12.880 --> 01:31:14.680]   - Church family, would you please stand with us
[01:31:14.680 --> 01:31:15.880]   for the closing praise?
