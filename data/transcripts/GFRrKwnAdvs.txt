[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:44.760]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:03:44.760 --> 00:03:47.760]   Happy New Year, and happy Lord's Day.
[00:03:47.760 --> 00:03:50.760]   Romans chapter five, verses three to five, it reads,
[00:03:50.760 --> 00:03:53.760]   "And not only this, but we also exult in our tribulations,
[00:03:53.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   "knowing that tribulation brings about perseverance,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   "and perseverance, proven character,
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.760]   "and proven character, hope.
[00:04:00.760 --> 00:04:03.760]   "And hope does not disappoint, because the love of God
[00:04:03.760 --> 00:04:05.760]   "has been poured out within our hearts
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:08.760]   "through the Holy Spirit, who was given to us."
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:11.760]   With this new year ahead of us,
[00:04:11.760 --> 00:04:15.760]   with the many blessings and perhaps trials ahead,
[00:04:15.760 --> 00:04:17.760]   may we persevere, may we rejoice,
[00:04:17.760 --> 00:04:20.760]   strengthened to know that we have the Holy Spirit with us
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:22.760]   and the love of God within us.

[00:08:13.760 --> 00:08:26.760]   - All right, welcome to our new 9/30 service.
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:30.760]   As I said, we're gonna be doing some changes
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.760]   and see how it goes.
[00:08:32.760 --> 00:08:36.760]   And so our first service actually had a lot more people
[00:08:36.760 --> 00:08:37.760]   than we expected.
[00:08:37.760 --> 00:08:39.760]   We had over 200 people in the first service,
[00:08:39.760 --> 00:08:42.760]   good and faithful early risers came.
[00:08:42.760 --> 00:08:44.760]   And so if that continues, obviously,
[00:08:44.760 --> 00:08:46.760]   that would be very helpful to be able to distribute
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:49.760]   the guests that are coming to church.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:52.760]   You know, I didn't really think much about, you know,
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:53.760]   three services.
[00:08:53.760 --> 00:08:55.760]   I was just--I was so busy doing other stuff,
[00:08:55.760 --> 00:08:56.760]   I wasn't thinking about it.
[00:08:56.760 --> 00:08:58.760]   But I probably had at least 100 people telling me
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:00.760]   they're praying for me.
[00:09:00.760 --> 00:09:02.760]   So my knees will hold up, okay?
[00:09:02.760 --> 00:09:04.760]   So I just want to give you a heads up.
[00:09:04.760 --> 00:09:08.760]   Like, one of the ways that I'm planning to preserve my knees
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:11.760]   is because if I stand for too long,
[00:09:11.760 --> 00:09:13.760]   I don't have much cartilage in between my two knees.
[00:09:13.760 --> 00:09:16.760]   And so if I stand up for a long period of time,
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:17.760]   it starts to swell up.
[00:09:17.760 --> 00:09:20.760]   So I'm gonna be sitting during the worship time.
[00:09:20.760 --> 00:09:22.760]   So if you see me sitting, don't judge me, okay?
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:24.760]   So I'm doing that because I'm trying to--
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:26.760]   I'm trying to make my knees last throughout the whole day.
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.760]   So just kind of--I'm just asking you for your pardon for that.
[00:09:30.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   Let me give a few announcements before we get started.
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:35.760]   First of all, next Sunday, as you guys know,
[00:09:35.760 --> 00:09:36.760]   is members meeting.
[00:09:36.760 --> 00:09:38.760]   It is scheduled for 2 p.m.
[00:09:38.760 --> 00:09:41.760]   And because of that, we are--the college students
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:43.760]   are gonna be doing a fundraiser so that you don't have
[00:09:43.760 --> 00:09:45.760]   to worry about going out and coming back.
[00:09:45.760 --> 00:09:47.760]   And so the lunch will be provided here.
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:49.760]   It's for $10 for Chipotle Bowl.
[00:09:49.760 --> 00:09:52.760]   Still cheaper than anything you can get outside, all right?
[00:09:52.760 --> 00:09:55.760]   So please mark that on your calendar, 2 p.m.
[00:09:55.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   And as I said, we're gonna--
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:09:59.760]   after about two to three months,
[00:09:59.760 --> 00:10:01.760]   we're gonna evaluate everything that we're doing
[00:10:01.760 --> 00:10:04.760]   to see if anything needs to be tweaked.
[00:10:04.760 --> 00:10:06.760]   So just be patient with us as we get adjusted
[00:10:06.760 --> 00:10:09.760]   to our new schedule of three services.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.760]   FAM 245 Ministry, if you are married three years or less,
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:17.760]   there is a workshop that's happening on January 20th
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:19.760]   at 10:30 a.m. in the Sprouts Room.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:21.760]   So mark that on your calendar.
[00:10:21.760 --> 00:10:24.760]   Bible Lab, as we are taking a break
[00:10:24.760 --> 00:10:26.760]   for our normal Bible study, there's a Bible Lab
[00:10:26.760 --> 00:10:29.760]   to help you to better prepare for Bible study,
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:30.760]   inductive Bible study.
[00:10:30.760 --> 00:10:32.760]   Pastor Mark is gonna be leading that.
[00:10:32.760 --> 00:10:35.760]   On Sundays from 2.30 to 3.30, one hour, three session,
[00:10:35.760 --> 00:10:39.760]   starting from January 21st, 28th, and the 4th,
[00:10:39.760 --> 00:10:40.760]   again, at 2.30.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:42.760]   So this would be after lunch,
[00:10:42.760 --> 00:10:45.760]   and then you'll be back on campus at 2.30 to 3.30.
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:48.760]   This will help you quite a bit to be able to--
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:51.760]   if you're having a hard time doing inductive Bible study,
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:53.760]   this will kind of get you jump-started
[00:10:53.760 --> 00:10:54.760]   to help you with that, okay?
[00:10:54.760 --> 00:10:56.760]   Again, just a few more announcements.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:10:59.760]   One, the Jubilee Ministry, if you're 50 and older,
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:01.760]   there is a new Bible reading plan,
[00:11:01.760 --> 00:11:03.760]   a fellowship that's gonna be happening,
[00:11:03.760 --> 00:11:05.760]   and it'd be an opportunity to get together
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:08.760]   with the other Jubilee members, again, if you're 50 and older,
[00:11:08.760 --> 00:11:10.760]   to go through the Bible together.
[00:11:10.760 --> 00:11:12.760]   I think it's the New Testament
[00:11:12.760 --> 00:11:14.760]   that they're gonna be going through.
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.760]   So please contact Elder Phillip,
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.760]   and he'll be able to sign you,
[00:11:18.760 --> 00:11:19.760]   and then I think there's fellowship
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:21.760]   that's going on along with that.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   And along with that, we have a new ministry
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:26.760]   called Fig Ministry, Families in God Ministry.
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:30.760]   So if you're not FAM 245, if you're not fairly newlyweds,
[00:11:30.760 --> 00:11:32.760]   or if you're not veterans, 50 and over,
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:35.760]   there's a big chunk of ministry that's in between.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:37.760]   There's a new ministry that's gonna be starting,
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:40.760]   and we're gonna be having a presentation
[00:11:40.760 --> 00:11:43.760]   from our brother Dean next Sunday
[00:11:43.760 --> 00:11:45.760]   to explain a little bit more during the members' meeting.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:50.760]   But they will also be having a Bible reading plan
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:53.760]   that's gonna be coinciding with the Jubilee.
[00:11:53.760 --> 00:11:55.760]   So if you want to sign up for that
[00:11:55.760 --> 00:11:57.760]   and to read through the Bible together,
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:11:59.760]   you can please sign up for that.
[00:11:59.760 --> 00:12:03.760]   I think there's a website sign-up, right?
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:05.760]   Where do they sign up, on the website?
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:07.760]   Okay, so go to the website,
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:09.760]   or after next members' meeting,
[00:12:09.760 --> 00:12:12.760]   there'll be sign-ups that you can take place after that.
[00:12:12.760 --> 00:12:14.760]   Okay, I think that's it.
[00:12:14.760 --> 00:12:16.760]   And one other thing is that Galatians Bible study
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:18.760]   is gonna be continuing in February,
[00:12:18.760 --> 00:12:20.760]   so we have the whole month of January off.
[00:12:20.760 --> 00:12:23.760]   Our India team is going to be leaving on January 26,
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:25.760]   and then when we get back,
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:27.760]   the Bible study's gonna begin, okay?
[00:12:27.760 --> 00:12:29.760]   So if you haven't signed up for home group or small group,
[00:12:29.760 --> 00:12:31.760]   please sign up as soon as possible
[00:12:31.760 --> 00:12:33.760]   so that we can better prepare for that, all right?
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:34.760]   Let me pray for us.
[00:12:34.760 --> 00:12:36.760]   And again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:12:36.760 --> 00:12:38.760]   there's an offering box in the back.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:41.760]   Otherwise, we'll be giving online.
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:44.760]   And afterwards, our brother CJ is going to be coming up,
[00:12:44.760 --> 00:12:46.760]   giving his testimony,
[00:12:46.760 --> 00:12:48.760]   and he will be baptized this morning, all right?
[00:12:48.760 --> 00:12:50.760]   Let's pray.
[00:12:50.760 --> 00:12:57.760]   Father, we thank you, Father,
[00:12:57.760 --> 00:13:00.760]   for this new day, Lord God,
[00:13:00.760 --> 00:13:04.760]   that we have to celebrate and to prepare for 2024.
[00:13:04.760 --> 00:13:08.760]   We pray, Lord, that you give us a heart of surrender,
[00:13:08.760 --> 00:13:13.760]   Lord, that we may worship you truly in spirit and in truth.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:16.760]   Focus our eyes and attention, Lord God, upon you,
[00:13:16.760 --> 00:13:18.760]   the author and perfecter of our faith,
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.760]   that we would desire to know you, to love you,
[00:13:21.760 --> 00:13:26.760]   to worship you more passionately than we've ever in 2024.
[00:13:26.760 --> 00:13:29.760]   Teach us, Lord God, to be a church, to pray,
[00:13:29.760 --> 00:13:31.760]   to pray earnestly, Lord God,
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:33.760]   that we may receive your power
[00:13:33.760 --> 00:13:36.760]   and that through us you will do mighty things.
[00:13:36.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   We pray that in our giving that you would multiply it, Lord God,
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:44.760]   multiply the joy, multiply, Lord God, the use of it.
[00:13:44.760 --> 00:13:47.760]   May it be used, Lord, effectively, wisely,
[00:13:47.760 --> 00:13:49.760]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:32.400]   - Hello, my name is CJ, and I'm part of the youth group,
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:34.400]   and this is my testimony.
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:37.400]   I grew up in a loving Christian home where I was blessed
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.400]   with parents who took us regularly to church.
[00:24:39.400 --> 00:24:41.400]   To me, church was a routine where I would go
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.400]   and have one day of the week to worship and learn about God.
[00:24:45.400 --> 00:24:48.400]   I had no true knowledge of Jesus and the gospel
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:50.400]   and didn't understand the meaning and weight
[00:24:50.400 --> 00:24:52.400]   of the sacrifice Jesus had made.
[00:24:52.400 --> 00:24:55.400]   I would memorize verses, but not to treasure God's word,
[00:24:55.400 --> 00:24:59.400]   but to make my parents proud and to avoid punishment.
[00:24:59.400 --> 00:25:02.400]   I would go to a one and offer another opportunity
[00:25:02.400 --> 00:25:04.400]   to be worshiping God or for fun games
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:06.400]   and for hanging out with friends.
[00:25:06.400 --> 00:25:09.400]   During the week, I was a disobedient kid
[00:25:09.400 --> 00:25:12.400]   and lied habitually to cover my own tracks.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:14.400]   When I would get caught, instead of feeling sorry,
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:17.400]   I would plan on how I could commit the sin again
[00:25:17.400 --> 00:25:19.400]   without getting caught.
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:22.400]   For a long while, I was content with this bland,
[00:25:22.400 --> 00:25:25.400]   sinful routine and was satisfied with this cycle of sin
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:28.400]   until I began high school.
[00:25:28.400 --> 00:25:31.400]   I would grow tired of being expected to memorize verses
[00:25:31.400 --> 00:25:33.400]   and to read the Bible.
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.400]   Worship had no true meaning to me,
[00:25:35.400 --> 00:25:37.400]   and I wanted to stop going to church
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:39.400]   so I could live my own life.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:41.400]   By the grace of God, I entered adolescence
[00:25:41.400 --> 00:25:43.400]   and started to attend the Vine Youth Group.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:45.400]   There, I finally began to hear the Bible
[00:25:45.400 --> 00:25:48.400]   and take the word more seriously.
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:50.400]   I would be more inclined to pay attention
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:54.400]   to the sermons of the pastors and heed warnings of sins.
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:57.400]   I tried to repent of my sins with sincerity and sorrow,
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:26:00.400]   but even with my having a better understanding
[00:26:00.400 --> 00:26:03.400]   of spiritual matters, my sinfulness began to accelerate
[00:26:03.400 --> 00:26:05.400]   at a shocking speed.
[00:26:05.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   I would indulge in lustful passions,
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:10.400]   lie on a regular basis, and always be angry and violent.
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:13.400]   I didn't truly understand what it meant to be saved
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:15.400]   and have a relationship with God,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:17.400]   and I lived a double life.
[00:26:17.400 --> 00:26:23.400]   On July 24, 2023, I finally came to Christ.
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.400]   Before that day, I was sneaking to play video games
[00:26:26.400 --> 00:26:28.400]   and wanting to have some entertainment
[00:26:28.400 --> 00:26:30.400]   before I went to sleep.
[00:26:30.400 --> 00:26:32.400]   I constantly pushed for the things that I desired,
[00:26:32.400 --> 00:26:36.400]   even if it meant I had to lie, cheat, or steal.
[00:26:36.400 --> 00:26:39.400]   If it weren't for screen time or limits on the device,
[00:26:39.400 --> 00:26:41.400]   I would not have gotten caught.
[00:26:41.400 --> 00:26:43.400]   But my dad caught me and told me
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:45.400]   that we would talk the next day.
[00:26:45.400 --> 00:26:47.400]   I went to sleep without feeling any sort of remorse
[00:26:47.400 --> 00:26:49.400]   for my sin and went to sleep wondering
[00:26:49.400 --> 00:26:52.400]   how I would get out of the punishment.
[00:26:52.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   The following day, I was ready to get it over with
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:59.400]   and the lecture and the punishment over with.
[00:26:59.400 --> 00:27:01.400]   My dad started to lecture me and my brother
[00:27:01.400 --> 00:27:04.400]   and spoke with us for a very long time.
[00:27:04.400 --> 00:27:06.400]   That was when he began to lead the conversation
[00:27:06.400 --> 00:27:08.400]   to the gospel.
[00:27:08.400 --> 00:27:10.400]   My dad began to break down emotionally,
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:12.400]   pleading with us to truly understand
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   why Jesus had to die for a sinful man.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.400]   It was then at that moment that
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.400]   a terrifying realization hit me.
[00:27:18.400 --> 00:27:21.400]   My dad does not get emotional that easily.
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:24.400]   This made me realize that this was truly serious
[00:27:24.400 --> 00:27:27.400]   and the sin in my life would destroy me.
[00:27:27.400 --> 00:27:29.400]   That's when I sat there on the couch
[00:27:29.400 --> 00:27:31.400]   and began to pray.
[00:27:31.400 --> 00:27:33.400]   During this time, many things fled in my mind
[00:27:33.400 --> 00:27:35.400]   and the weight of my sins overwhelmed me.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:38.400]   I thought of the times where I attempted to repent
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:40.400]   but was only in vain.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.400]   I thought of the times where I would only think
[00:27:42.400 --> 00:27:45.400]   about myself and my selfish desires.
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.400]   I thought of my friends who had recently given
[00:27:47.400 --> 00:27:50.400]   their lives to Christ and what that truly meant for me.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.400]   I realized that the gospel was my faith
[00:27:53.400 --> 00:27:55.400]   and that all I had to do was grasp the invitation
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   into the family of God.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.400]   I prayed for a while before finally making
[00:28:00.400 --> 00:28:03.400]   the decision to come to Christ
[00:28:03.400 --> 00:28:07.400]   and accept Him as my Savior.
[00:28:07.400 --> 00:28:09.400]   I asked my parents to pray with me
[00:28:09.400 --> 00:28:12.400]   while I repented and surrendered my life to Christ.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.400]   After being convinced that I was truly saved,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.400]   I felt an intense joy.
[00:28:16.400 --> 00:28:19.400]   I felt at peace for the first time in a long time.
[00:28:19.400 --> 00:28:22.400]   It was that feeling that I remember to this very day
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:25.400]   and I am thankful to God for it.
[00:28:25.400 --> 00:28:28.400]   That day, I meditated on a specific chapter
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:30.400]   that my parents told me to read.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.400]   That chapter was Ephesians 2.
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:35.400]   A verse that really stood out to me was verses 8 through 9.
[00:28:35.400 --> 00:28:37.400]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith
[00:28:37.400 --> 00:28:39.400]   "and that not of yourself, it is the gift of God,
[00:28:39.400 --> 00:28:43.400]   "not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[00:28:43.400 --> 00:28:46.400]   I did nothing to contribute to my conversion.
[00:28:46.400 --> 00:28:49.400]   God yanked me out of the water while I was drowning
[00:28:49.400 --> 00:28:52.400]   and by mercy, Jesus created a way
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:28:56.400]   so I can escape the eternal punishment that was for me.
[00:28:56.400 --> 00:28:59.400]   By His grace, I am able to say that I am a child of God
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.400]   and I will walk with Him until being called
[00:29:01.400 --> 00:29:03.400]   into His presence forever.
[00:29:03.400 --> 00:29:06.400]   I know that I will struggle with the weight of wanting to sin,
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:09.400]   but because of Jesus, I can confidently say
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:11.400]   that He will be with me every step of the way.
[00:29:11.400 --> 00:29:13.400]   Thank you.
[00:29:13.400 --> 00:29:22.400]   [applause]
[00:29:22.400 --> 00:29:24.400]   [coughing]
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:31.400]   [liquid pouring]
[00:29:31.400 --> 00:29:33.400]   If you understand, when you're going into the water,
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:35.400]   you're being united with Christ's death.
[00:29:35.400 --> 00:29:37.400]   Then when you come back out,
[00:29:37.400 --> 00:29:40.400]   you're being united with resurrected life.
[00:29:40.400 --> 00:29:42.400]   I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:29:42.400 --> 00:29:45.400]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:45.400 --> 00:29:48.400]   [liquid pouring]
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:30:02.400]   [applause]
[00:30:02.400 --> 00:30:10.400]   Obviously, this is a very special day
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:13.400]   for the Jun family.
[00:30:13.400 --> 00:30:16.400]   I know that they've been praying for CJ
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:18.400]   and their children's salvation for so many years.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:22.400]   Also, watching him grow up since he was a baby.
[00:30:22.400 --> 00:30:25.400]   He was born six months before my son.
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:28.400]   I remember my earliest memory of CJ was
[00:30:28.400 --> 00:30:31.400]   we were at Best Western summer retreat.
[00:30:31.400 --> 00:30:33.400]   I was watching the kids.
[00:30:33.400 --> 00:30:36.400]   I think they were right around one years old.
[00:30:36.400 --> 00:30:38.400]   They weren't able to stand yet,
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:40.400]   but I remember looking at both of them saying,
[00:30:40.400 --> 00:30:42.400]   "Don't touch this."
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   For whatever it was, I was in the room by myself.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.400]   I said, "Don't touch this."
[00:30:46.400 --> 00:30:48.400]   I remember CJ looking straight in my eyes
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.400]   and just moving his arm.
[00:30:50.400 --> 00:30:52.400]   [laughter]
[00:30:52.400 --> 00:30:54.400]   He was looking straight at me.
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:56.400]   He kind of skirted it just to see.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:58.400]   I said, "No, CJ!"
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:31:00.400]   Anyway, that's my earliest memory of him.
[00:31:00.400 --> 00:31:03.400]   Then seeing him give his testimony this morning
[00:31:03.400 --> 00:31:05.400]   is just so real.
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:08.400]   Overjoyed for him, for the family, for our church
[00:31:08.400 --> 00:31:10.400]   to be able to see our children grow up.
[00:31:10.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   All the people who invested in his life as well at church,
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:16.400]   so many teachers who throughout the years,
[00:31:16.400 --> 00:31:18.400]   whether it was Sunday school or VBS
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:20.400]   or even a youth group,
[00:31:20.400 --> 00:31:22.400]   and just sitting there and counseling him
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.400]   and coming alongside with the parents
[00:31:24.400 --> 00:31:26.400]   to be able to share the gospel with him.
[00:31:26.400 --> 00:31:28.400]   That's ultimately our desire.
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.400]   What we see with CJ is that every single one of our children
[00:31:31.400 --> 00:31:33.400]   will be able to be raised in a church
[00:31:33.400 --> 00:31:35.400]   that really values the gospel,
[00:31:35.400 --> 00:31:38.400]   and that this is not just something that we just talk about
[00:31:38.400 --> 00:31:40.400]   and have a form of godliness,
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:42.400]   but that our next generation of children
[00:31:42.400 --> 00:31:44.400]   who are being raised in this home,
[00:31:44.400 --> 00:31:46.400]   some of them maybe babies now,
[00:31:46.400 --> 00:31:49.400]   that hopefully when they are our age,
[00:31:49.400 --> 00:31:51.400]   that they'll be able to take the baton
[00:31:51.400 --> 00:31:53.400]   and really be able to be a greater light
[00:31:53.400 --> 00:31:55.400]   for the next generation.
[00:31:55.400 --> 00:31:57.400]   Again, seeing CJ get baptized just, again,
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.400]   gives greater hope for me
[00:31:59.400 --> 00:32:02.400]   and for all of us for our next generation.
[00:32:02.400 --> 00:32:05.400]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Ephesians 6,
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.400]   I'm just going to be reading one verse.
[00:32:07.400 --> 00:32:09.400]   I'm going to be in this text,
[00:32:09.400 --> 00:32:11.400]   the very familiar text
[00:32:11.400 --> 00:32:13.400]   that's in verse 10 all the way down
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:15.400]   for the next three weeks.
[00:32:15.400 --> 00:32:18.400]   As we transition to the new year in 2024,
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.400]   as you can see,
[00:32:20.400 --> 00:32:22.400]   our banner has changed,
[00:32:22.400 --> 00:32:24.400]   at least on one side.
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.400]   We've been focusing on this
[00:32:26.400 --> 00:32:28.400]   probably the last five or more years.
[00:32:28.400 --> 00:32:30.400]   It's pray and proclaim,
[00:32:30.400 --> 00:32:32.400]   pray and be sober,
[00:32:32.400 --> 00:32:34.400]   pray and be watchful.
[00:32:34.400 --> 00:32:36.400]   As we're wrestling with this,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.400]   it's like do we want to have this theme again
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:40.400]   or is there something else?
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:42.400]   The reason why I decided to choose this
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.400]   because I can't think of anything else
[00:32:44.400 --> 00:32:46.400]   that really stands out to me
[00:32:46.400 --> 00:32:48.400]   that really requires
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:50.400]   and that we need to improve on
[00:32:50.400 --> 00:32:52.400]   than this.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:54.400]   Even if for the rest of my tenure at this church
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:56.400]   that this is something
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:32:58.400]   that we're going to be focusing on,
[00:32:58.400 --> 00:33:00.400]   until our church
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:02.400]   actually has a reputation of being
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:04.400]   a prayer church,
[00:33:04.400 --> 00:33:06.400]   I believe that this is something we need to focus on.
[00:33:06.400 --> 00:33:08.400]   We need to continue to grow
[00:33:08.400 --> 00:33:10.400]   including myself.
[00:33:10.400 --> 00:33:12.400]   This is a reminder to us
[00:33:12.400 --> 00:33:14.400]   that as we go this year
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:16.400]   that we want to improve.
[00:33:16.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   If we improve and our church continues to grow
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:20.400]   and Bible studies and all these things
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:22.400]   are growing,
[00:33:22.400 --> 00:33:24.400]   but we have not moved in the depth
[00:33:24.400 --> 00:33:26.400]   of our prayer and our devotion to prayer,
[00:33:26.400 --> 00:33:28.400]   I would not consider that a success.
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.400]   I think this is something
[00:33:30.400 --> 00:33:32.400]   that we really need to work on
[00:33:32.400 --> 00:33:34.400]   and that's why we're emphasizing this again
[00:33:34.400 --> 00:33:36.400]   in this text. I'm going to read verse 18
[00:33:36.400 --> 00:33:38.400]   and we'll jump in this morning.
[00:33:38.400 --> 00:33:40.400]   With all prayer and petition,
[00:33:40.400 --> 00:33:42.400]   pray at all times in the Spirit
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.400]   and with this in view,
[00:33:44.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   be on the alert with all perseverance
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:48.400]   and petition for all the saints.
[00:33:48.400 --> 00:33:50.400]   Heavenly Father, we pray
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:52.400]   for your direction, your guidance,
[00:33:52.400 --> 00:33:54.400]   and your understanding, Lord God.
[00:33:54.400 --> 00:33:56.400]   We pray for your mercy.
[00:33:56.400 --> 00:33:58.400]   We pray for your grace.
[00:33:58.400 --> 00:34:00.400]   May your word and your word only
[00:34:00.400 --> 00:34:02.400]   go forth. In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:04.400]   Amen.
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:06.400]   So the theme of this year is
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:08.400]   pray in the Spirit.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:10.400]   But what does praying in the Spirit mean?
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:12.400]   Now,
[00:34:12.400 --> 00:34:14.400]   if you're from a charismatic background,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:16.400]   you may have heard that maybe praying in the Spirit
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:18.400]   is some mystical thing that you need to be
[00:34:18.400 --> 00:34:20.400]   touched or maybe you need to be praying
[00:34:20.400 --> 00:34:22.400]   in tongues and that's what it means to be praying
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:24.400]   in the Spirit.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:26.400]   But that term "praying in the Spirit" is not unique to this
[00:34:26.400 --> 00:34:28.400]   text. In fact, all over Scripture
[00:34:28.400 --> 00:34:30.400]   we are reminded that everything
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   that we do is to be done in the
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.400]   Spirit. That you can study
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.400]   the Bible, you can walk, you can do evangelism,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.400]   do all this stuff, but at the core of it
[00:34:38.400 --> 00:34:40.400]   when Jesus says, "You cannot
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:42.400]   bear fruit unless you abide in me,"
[00:34:42.400 --> 00:34:44.400]   He says "abide in me"
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:46.400]   in John chapter 15 after
[00:34:46.400 --> 00:34:48.400]   He reminds them in chapter 13 and
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.400]   14 that the Holy Spirit, the Helper, is
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.400]   going to come. That He's not going to leave
[00:34:52.400 --> 00:34:54.400]   them as orphans. So when He says
[00:34:54.400 --> 00:34:56.400]   to abide, He is referring
[00:34:56.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   them to the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:00.400]   That you cannot bear fruit unless
[00:35:00.400 --> 00:35:02.400]   you are abiding in the Holy Spirit. You need to
[00:35:02.400 --> 00:35:04.400]   continue in the Holy Spirit.
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.400]   So in Galatians 5.16
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.400]   we are told to walk in the Spirit.
[00:35:08.400 --> 00:35:10.400]   In Romans 8.13
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.400]   He says, "The identifying mark
[00:35:12.400 --> 00:35:14.400]   of a child of God is one
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.400]   who is being led by the Spirit."
[00:35:16.400 --> 00:35:18.400]   Philippians 3.3, He said,
[00:35:18.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   "We are to worship in the Spirit."
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.400]   1 Corinthians 14.16
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:24.400]   "When we bless one another,
[00:35:24.400 --> 00:35:26.400]   we are to bless in the Spirit."
[00:35:26.400 --> 00:35:28.400]   In Galatians 6.1
[00:35:28.400 --> 00:35:30.400]   if somebody falls into sin, that
[00:35:30.400 --> 00:35:32.400]   we are trying to restore them,
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   He says, "We are to restore them in
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:36.400]   the Spirit." And then
[00:35:36.400 --> 00:35:38.400]   He says in Romans 8.26, "The Holy
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.400]   Spirit, when it prays, it
[00:35:40.400 --> 00:35:42.400]   groans on our behalf."
[00:35:42.400 --> 00:35:44.400]   It groans on our behalf
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.400]   that we may be able to have
[00:35:46.400 --> 00:35:48.400]   effective prayer.
[00:35:48.400 --> 00:35:50.400]   So you cannot
[00:35:50.400 --> 00:35:52.400]   do anything as a
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:54.400]   Christian if you're not
[00:35:54.400 --> 00:35:56.400]   in the Spirit.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.400]   Or else it becomes just a religious activity.
[00:35:58.400 --> 00:36:00.400]   Everything that we do in
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:02.400]   the church, if we are doing it by our own strength,
[00:36:02.400 --> 00:36:04.400]   it's no different than a
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:06.400]   Buddhist going to a temple and lighting
[00:36:06.400 --> 00:36:08.400]   up some incense and hoping that
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:10.400]   the powers
[00:36:10.400 --> 00:36:12.400]   are going to answer your prayers for your purpose.
[00:36:12.400 --> 00:36:14.400]   So it's nothing more than
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:16.400]   a religious activity unless it is
[00:36:16.400 --> 00:36:18.400]   in the Spirit.
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.400]   That's the identifying mark of a Christian
[00:36:20.400 --> 00:36:22.400]   and a non-Christian. So in the church,
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:24.400]   you may have people who are filled,
[00:36:24.400 --> 00:36:26.400]   who grew up in the church and out of habit
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:28.400]   or superstition, are
[00:36:28.400 --> 00:36:30.400]   doing things because they want blessing from God
[00:36:30.400 --> 00:36:32.400]   so that they can live a better life. It's just that
[00:36:32.400 --> 00:36:34.400]   the avenue that we have chosen
[00:36:34.400 --> 00:36:36.400]   to get blessing for a better life
[00:36:36.400 --> 00:36:38.400]   is Jesus.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:40.400]   For Buddhists, it may be
[00:36:40.400 --> 00:36:42.400]   Buddha, right?
[00:36:42.400 --> 00:36:44.400]   For anybody else, whatever God that they choose,
[00:36:44.400 --> 00:36:46.400]   it's just that that's just the avenue
[00:36:46.400 --> 00:36:48.400]   that they had access to so that
[00:36:48.400 --> 00:36:50.400]   they can have a better life.
[00:36:50.400 --> 00:36:52.400]   The distinguishing mark of a Christian is the
[00:36:52.400 --> 00:36:54.400]   Spirit. The Spirit of God
[00:36:54.400 --> 00:36:56.400]   dwells in us and the Spirit
[00:36:56.400 --> 00:36:58.400]   of God leads us. The Spirit of
[00:36:58.400 --> 00:37:00.400]   God causes us to walk with
[00:37:00.400 --> 00:37:02.400]   Him and it is the Spirit of God
[00:37:02.400 --> 00:37:04.400]   that teaches us to pray.
[00:37:04.400 --> 00:37:06.400]   And so,
[00:37:06.400 --> 00:37:08.400]   not only do we need to pray,
[00:37:08.400 --> 00:37:10.400]   just do it. Just get
[00:37:10.400 --> 00:37:12.400]   it done. He says no, to
[00:37:12.400 --> 00:37:14.400]   pray at all times in
[00:37:14.400 --> 00:37:16.400]   the Spirit. Now,
[00:37:16.400 --> 00:37:18.400]   in order to understand what does it mean to pray
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:20.400]   in the Spirit, again, everything needs to
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:22.400]   be understood in the context of
[00:37:22.400 --> 00:37:24.400]   the text.
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   If we want to understand what Paul means by
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.400]   praying in the Spirit, we need to
[00:37:28.400 --> 00:37:30.400]   understand what he's been saying prior.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:32.400]   So if you know, we've
[00:37:32.400 --> 00:37:34.400]   studied the book of Ephesians several times in our
[00:37:34.400 --> 00:37:36.400]   church history, and if you know the book of Ephesians,
[00:37:36.400 --> 00:37:38.400]   it's divided into two major parts.
[00:37:38.400 --> 00:37:40.400]   First three chapters is
[00:37:40.400 --> 00:37:42.400]   doctrine. It tells us
[00:37:42.400 --> 00:37:44.400]   about Christ,
[00:37:44.400 --> 00:37:46.400]   His love, election,
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   predestination,
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.400]   how we've become adopted
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:52.400]   as children of God. And then chapter
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:54.400]   four through six, he says,
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:56.400]   "Therefore, live up to the gospel
[00:37:56.400 --> 00:37:58.400]   that you've been given." That we need to be
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:00.400]   united, what does it mean to be
[00:38:00.400 --> 00:38:02.400]   a good father,
[00:38:02.400 --> 00:38:04.400]   to be a young man, and so
[00:38:04.400 --> 00:38:06.400]   it gives us imperatives based
[00:38:06.400 --> 00:38:08.400]   upon the doctrines that we
[00:38:08.400 --> 00:38:10.400]   know about Christ, the gospel.
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.400]   And then the conclusion
[00:38:12.400 --> 00:38:14.400]   of everything that he says is in this text
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:16.400]   in chapter six.
[00:38:16.400 --> 00:38:18.400]   That after you've learned all the doctrines, and
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:20.400]   you know, like, this is how you ought to live,
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:22.400]   he concludes
[00:38:22.400 --> 00:38:24.400]   this section by saying, "Pray,
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:26.400]   pray, pray, pray."
[00:38:26.400 --> 00:38:28.400]   Now you
[00:38:28.400 --> 00:38:30.400]   know that anything in the Bible that is
[00:38:30.400 --> 00:38:32.400]   said in repetition,
[00:38:32.400 --> 00:38:34.400]   you know that we're supposed to pay more close
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:36.400]   attention. Like today, if we wanted
[00:38:36.400 --> 00:38:38.400]   to emphasize something, you might highlight it,
[00:38:38.400 --> 00:38:40.400]   bold it, you know, you might put circles around
[00:38:40.400 --> 00:38:42.400]   it, whatever it is, so that whoever comes to
[00:38:42.400 --> 00:38:44.400]   that text, you know, you need to pay attention to this.
[00:38:44.400 --> 00:38:46.400]   Apostle Paul
[00:38:46.400 --> 00:38:48.400]   in verse 18 isn't by
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.400]   accident that he mentions
[00:38:50.400 --> 00:38:52.400]   petitioning and praying
[00:38:52.400 --> 00:38:54.400]   four separate times for all things, for all
[00:38:54.400 --> 00:38:56.400]   occasions. "Pray, pray,
[00:38:56.400 --> 00:38:58.400]   pray, pray, pray." So we can
[00:38:58.400 --> 00:39:00.400]   say that everything that he has said
[00:39:00.400 --> 00:39:02.400]   in six chapters concludes
[00:39:02.400 --> 00:39:04.400]   his main point
[00:39:04.400 --> 00:39:06.400]   by saying, "Pray, pray, pray,
[00:39:06.400 --> 00:39:08.400]   pray."
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:10.400]   So I can't overemphasize
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.400]   enough why this is
[00:39:12.400 --> 00:39:14.400]   so important, why our church
[00:39:14.400 --> 00:39:16.400]   needs to continue to grow
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:18.400]   in this aspect.
[00:39:18.400 --> 00:39:20.400]   We need to pray. But in praying,
[00:39:20.400 --> 00:39:22.400]   if our prayers are going to be effective,
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.400]   it needs to be praying in
[00:39:24.400 --> 00:39:26.400]   the Spirit, right?
[00:39:26.400 --> 00:39:28.400]   So what does, again, in the context
[00:39:28.400 --> 00:39:30.400]   of that, what does praying in the Spirit mean?
[00:39:30.400 --> 00:39:32.400]   Well, if you look at verse
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:34.400]   10 through 12,
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:36.400]   it tells us that we need to
[00:39:36.400 --> 00:39:38.400]   pray in the Spirit because we are in spiritual
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:40.400]   warfare.
[00:39:40.400 --> 00:39:42.400]   "Finally, be strong in the Lord, and
[00:39:42.400 --> 00:39:44.400]   in the strength of His might, put on the full armor of God
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:46.400]   so that you may be able to stand firm against the
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:48.400]   schemes of the devil. For our struggle
[00:39:48.400 --> 00:39:50.400]   is not against flesh and blood, but against
[00:39:50.400 --> 00:39:52.400]   the rulers, against the powers, against the world
[00:39:52.400 --> 00:39:54.400]   forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces
[00:39:54.400 --> 00:39:56.400]   of wickedness in heavenly places."
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   In other words,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:00.400]   praying in the Spirit means that
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:02.400]   we are engaged in a spiritual
[00:40:02.400 --> 00:40:04.400]   battle, right?
[00:40:04.400 --> 00:40:06.400]   First and foremost,
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:08.400]   so before we pray
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.400]   that our finance is good,
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:12.400]   or even for our health,
[00:40:12.400 --> 00:40:14.400]   before we pray that we may
[00:40:14.400 --> 00:40:16.400]   have a better and comfortable
[00:40:16.400 --> 00:40:18.400]   and more peaceful life, first
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.400]   and foremost, praying in the Spirit is
[00:40:20.400 --> 00:40:22.400]   engaging in the battle that the Spirit
[00:40:22.400 --> 00:40:24.400]   of God is engaged in.
[00:40:24.400 --> 00:40:26.400]   That's what He means by that.
[00:40:26.400 --> 00:40:28.400]   So here, when He says praying in the Spirit,
[00:40:28.400 --> 00:40:30.400]   it's not necessarily just something mystical or praying
[00:40:30.400 --> 00:40:32.400]   in tongues, but that we are praying
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:34.400]   according to
[00:40:34.400 --> 00:40:36.400]   what the Spirit Himself is engaged in,
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.400]   recognizing
[00:40:38.400 --> 00:40:40.400]   that we are engaged in spiritual
[00:40:40.400 --> 00:40:42.400]   battle.
[00:40:42.400 --> 00:40:44.400]   There are a couple of things that we need to understand
[00:40:44.400 --> 00:40:46.400]   about praying in the Spirit, right?
[00:40:46.400 --> 00:40:48.400]   First Peter 3, 7,
[00:40:48.400 --> 00:40:50.400]   where we are encouraged to pray, He says,
[00:40:50.400 --> 00:40:52.400]   "You husbands, in the same way,
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:54.400]   live with your wives in an understanding way
[00:40:54.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   as with someone weaker, since she
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:58.400]   is a woman, and show her honor as a
[00:40:58.400 --> 00:41:00.400]   fellow heir of the grace of life,
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.400]   so that your prayers will not be
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.400]   hindered." I want you to
[00:41:04.400 --> 00:41:06.400]   notice here, He doesn't say,
[00:41:06.400 --> 00:41:08.400]   He doesn't say, "Pray
[00:41:08.400 --> 00:41:10.400]   so that you can be a better husband."
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:12.400]   That's not what it says.
[00:41:12.400 --> 00:41:14.400]   He said, "Be a better husband
[00:41:14.400 --> 00:41:16.400]   so that you can pray."
[00:41:16.400 --> 00:41:18.400]   So the
[00:41:18.400 --> 00:41:20.400]   purpose of righteous living
[00:41:20.400 --> 00:41:22.400]   is so that we can have
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.400]   better, effective prayer. So the point
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:26.400]   of righteousness is
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:28.400]   prayer. Prayer is not
[00:41:28.400 --> 00:41:30.400]   what makes us righteous.
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:32.400]   Righteousness is what causes us
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:34.400]   to be effective prayer warriors.
[00:41:34.400 --> 00:41:36.400]   Again, in 1 Peter 4, 7,
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:38.400]   "The end of all things is near;
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:40.400]   therefore, be sound judgment and sober
[00:41:40.400 --> 00:41:42.400]   spirit for the purpose of
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.400]   prayer." You notice
[00:41:44.400 --> 00:41:46.400]   here, He doesn't say,
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:48.400]   "Pray so that you can be sober."
[00:41:48.400 --> 00:41:50.400]   He says, "No, be sober
[00:41:50.400 --> 00:41:52.400]   so that you can pray."
[00:41:52.400 --> 00:41:54.400]   So the emphasis
[00:41:54.400 --> 00:41:56.400]   here, the actual work here, is not
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.400]   soberness. The actual work here
[00:41:58.400 --> 00:42:00.400]   is not being a good husband.
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:02.400]   The actual work here
[00:42:02.400 --> 00:42:04.400]   is praying.
[00:42:04.400 --> 00:42:06.400]   Now you can understand, if
[00:42:06.400 --> 00:42:08.400]   the work is flesh and
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:10.400]   blood, that what we do in the
[00:42:10.400 --> 00:42:12.400]   flesh and blood is going to matter. So we
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:14.400]   pray so that we can be more effective
[00:42:14.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   in flesh and blood.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:18.400]   But that's not what He says.
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:20.400]   He said our battle is not against
[00:42:20.400 --> 00:42:22.400]   flesh and blood.
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:24.400]   It's not against flesh and blood.
[00:42:24.400 --> 00:42:26.400]   So that
[00:42:26.400 --> 00:42:28.400]   you being better equipped to do
[00:42:28.400 --> 00:42:30.400]   physical things is not the
[00:42:30.400 --> 00:42:32.400]   point. He said
[00:42:32.400 --> 00:42:34.400]   doing physical things is so
[00:42:34.400 --> 00:42:36.400]   that you may prepare yourself
[00:42:36.400 --> 00:42:38.400]   for the actual warfare
[00:42:38.400 --> 00:42:40.400]   which is happening in prayer.
[00:42:40.400 --> 00:42:42.400]   That's what He's saying.
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:44.400]   Prayer is the battle.
[00:42:44.400 --> 00:42:46.400]   Discipleship
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.400]   is so that we can be better
[00:42:48.400 --> 00:42:50.400]   prayer warriors. So if discipleship
[00:42:50.400 --> 00:42:52.400]   leads to less prayer or not
[00:42:52.400 --> 00:42:54.400]   enough prayer, then you've missed the whole point of
[00:42:54.400 --> 00:42:56.400]   discipleship. If Bible
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:58.400]   study, all it does is causes you
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:00.400]   to understand the Bible better,
[00:43:00.400 --> 00:43:02.400]   but it hasn't caused you to pray
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.400]   more effectively, then you've missed the whole point
[00:43:04.400 --> 00:43:06.400]   of Bible study.
[00:43:06.400 --> 00:43:08.400]   Because the whole purpose of Bible study in every
[00:43:08.400 --> 00:43:10.400]   spiritual activity is to bring us closer to
[00:43:10.400 --> 00:43:12.400]   God. And it
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:14.400]   brings us closer to God when we are able to
[00:43:14.400 --> 00:43:16.400]   pray. And we are able to
[00:43:16.400 --> 00:43:18.400]   experience spiritual power
[00:43:18.400 --> 00:43:20.400]   when we pray. So He says
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.400]   our struggle is
[00:43:22.400 --> 00:43:24.400]   not against flesh and blood, meaning
[00:43:24.400 --> 00:43:26.400]   He's not telling
[00:43:26.400 --> 00:43:28.400]   us to be stronger
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:30.400]   in flesh and blood.
[00:43:30.400 --> 00:43:32.400]   That's the point that He's making.
[00:43:32.400 --> 00:43:34.400]   There's not a battle
[00:43:34.400 --> 00:43:36.400]   that you can win by working
[00:43:36.400 --> 00:43:38.400]   harder or being more disciplined or smarter
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:40.400]   or having more methods.
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   That's His first point. I'm not saying that.
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.400]   But He says our battle is
[00:43:44.400 --> 00:43:46.400]   against rulers,
[00:43:46.400 --> 00:43:48.400]   against powers, against world forces of
[00:43:48.400 --> 00:43:50.400]   this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:43:50.400 --> 00:43:52.400]   in heavenly places.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:54.400]   All to say,
[00:43:54.400 --> 00:43:56.400]   if you were to conclude why
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.400]   He says this, that we can get
[00:43:58.400 --> 00:44:00.400]   in there and we'll talk about
[00:44:00.400 --> 00:44:02.400]   the breastplate of righteousness and the helmet of
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   salvation and the shoes
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.400]   and girding your loins
[00:44:06.400 --> 00:44:08.400]   and all of that stuff.
[00:44:08.400 --> 00:44:10.400]   But at the end of it, what is the point? Why is
[00:44:10.400 --> 00:44:12.400]   He saying all of these things?
[00:44:12.400 --> 00:44:14.400]   He's saying all of these things because He said this is
[00:44:14.400 --> 00:44:16.400]   beyond you.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.400]   Your fight isn't you.
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:20.400]   The success of the fight isn't going to be
[00:44:20.400 --> 00:44:22.400]   your discipline, your knowledge,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.400]   your work. It's not flesh and blood.
[00:44:24.400 --> 00:44:26.400]   How are a bunch of
[00:44:26.400 --> 00:44:28.400]   fishermen going to go against the rulers by their
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:30.400]   own power?
[00:44:30.400 --> 00:44:32.400]   Did Jesus really equip them? And they're
[00:44:32.400 --> 00:44:34.400]   so well trained that when
[00:44:34.400 --> 00:44:36.400]   their whole
[00:44:36.400 --> 00:44:38.400]   Jewish community want to kill them,
[00:44:38.400 --> 00:44:40.400]   have they been properly trained to know
[00:44:40.400 --> 00:44:42.400]   when they go right, go
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.400]   pivot to the left?
[00:44:44.400 --> 00:44:46.400]   Right?
[00:44:46.400 --> 00:44:48.400]   If you see them ahead and hiding,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:50.400]   were they properly trained so that
[00:44:50.400 --> 00:44:52.400]   they can maneuver away from that?
[00:44:52.400 --> 00:44:54.400]   And when you preach the gospel, don't stand too high,
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:56.400]   stand low, and then when a crowd
[00:44:56.400 --> 00:44:58.400]   comes, make sure you know,
[00:44:58.400 --> 00:45:00.400]   you maneuver. Were they all trained?
[00:45:00.400 --> 00:45:02.400]   Is that what Jesus was doing?
[00:45:02.400 --> 00:45:04.400]   For the three years that
[00:45:04.400 --> 00:45:06.400]   He was walking around with His disciples,
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   is that when you go there, they're going to try to kill you,
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.400]   so I'm going to better equip you
[00:45:10.400 --> 00:45:12.400]   to take the gospel into hostile
[00:45:12.400 --> 00:45:14.400]   areas when the Roman soldiers come with
[00:45:14.400 --> 00:45:16.400]   swords and legions come to kill
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:18.400]   Apostle Paul?
[00:45:18.400 --> 00:45:20.400]   That because you're properly trained
[00:45:20.400 --> 00:45:22.400]   that they
[00:45:22.400 --> 00:45:24.400]   gave you the tools to be able to maneuver
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:26.400]   and get the gospel out to the remotest
[00:45:26.400 --> 00:45:28.400]   part of the world because of your proper
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.400]   discipline and training and method?
[00:45:30.400 --> 00:45:32.400]   No!
[00:45:32.400 --> 00:45:34.400]   Jesus didn't train them
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:36.400]   any of that!
[00:45:36.400 --> 00:45:38.400]   All He said was, "Abide in Me."
[00:45:38.400 --> 00:45:40.400]   Don't worry. When they take you
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:42.400]   into court and
[00:45:42.400 --> 00:45:44.400]   these rulers who killed me
[00:45:44.400 --> 00:45:46.400]   are threatening you to do the same thing
[00:45:46.400 --> 00:45:48.400]   and you don't know what to say, don't worry. The Holy
[00:45:48.400 --> 00:45:50.400]   Spirit is going to give you the
[00:45:50.400 --> 00:45:52.400]   words. And that's why He says,
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:54.400]   "Abide, abide, abide."
[00:45:54.400 --> 00:45:56.400]   What are a bunch of farmers going to do against
[00:45:56.400 --> 00:45:58.400]   rulers? What are a bunch of
[00:45:58.400 --> 00:46:00.400]   commoners going to do against powers?
[00:46:00.400 --> 00:46:02.400]   How will you fight
[00:46:02.400 --> 00:46:04.400]   wickedness in heavenly
[00:46:04.400 --> 00:46:06.400]   places?
[00:46:06.400 --> 00:46:08.400]   We look at it and say, "Well, these politicians
[00:46:08.400 --> 00:46:10.400]   are evil, so if we remove them from power,
[00:46:10.400 --> 00:46:12.400]   yeah, flesh and blood. You can remove the flesh
[00:46:12.400 --> 00:46:14.400]   and blood. What are you going to do about the wickedness
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.400]   that is controlling these people?
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.400]   How are you going to remove those
[00:46:18.400 --> 00:46:20.400]   powers? How are you going to conquer
[00:46:20.400 --> 00:46:22.400]   those powers?" So the point of all
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.400]   of this
[00:46:24.400 --> 00:46:26.400]   is to remind the readers
[00:46:26.400 --> 00:46:28.400]   of the Ephesians, you are completely
[00:46:28.400 --> 00:46:30.400]   powerless by yourself.
[00:46:30.400 --> 00:46:34.400]   People
[00:46:34.400 --> 00:46:36.400]   who pray are the people who feel
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.400]   helpless.
[00:46:38.400 --> 00:46:40.400]   You know, even in your own life,
[00:46:40.400 --> 00:46:42.400]   when do you pray the most fervently?
[00:46:42.400 --> 00:46:44.400]   It's when you're in a situation where you
[00:46:44.400 --> 00:46:46.400]   feel utterly helpless. Maybe
[00:46:46.400 --> 00:46:48.400]   a life is on the line. Maybe somebody
[00:46:48.400 --> 00:46:50.400]   you love is on
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:52.400]   deathbed and all
[00:46:52.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   the doctors help, it's just not working,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:56.400]   and they say, "Please pray."
[00:46:56.400 --> 00:46:58.400]   Even non-Christians
[00:46:58.400 --> 00:47:00.400]   pray when they feel helpless.
[00:47:00.400 --> 00:47:02.400]   Some of you guys who are a little bit older,
[00:47:02.400 --> 00:47:04.400]   remember after 9/11,
[00:47:04.400 --> 00:47:06.400]   we're all
[00:47:06.400 --> 00:47:08.400]   shocked because we've never seen this, not
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.400]   on American soil,
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:12.400]   right? Not since
[00:47:12.400 --> 00:47:14.400]   1940s, we've never seen this. So all
[00:47:14.400 --> 00:47:16.400]   of a sudden, we all
[00:47:16.400 --> 00:47:18.400]   just got shocked. This can happen, we can
[00:47:18.400 --> 00:47:20.400]   actually go to war, and
[00:47:20.400 --> 00:47:22.400]   for the first time, I've never seen this
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:24.400]   before and I've never seen this since,
[00:47:24.400 --> 00:47:26.400]   the Democrats and the
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.400]   Republicans stood at Capitol
[00:47:28.400 --> 00:47:30.400]   Hill, arm in arm, and they
[00:47:30.400 --> 00:47:32.400]   had a prayer vigil.
[00:47:32.400 --> 00:47:34.400]   That was such a strange scene because
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.400]   I don't think any of them were Christians.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:38.400]   Maybe there was a Christian in there,
[00:47:38.400 --> 00:47:40.400]   I don't know.
[00:47:40.400 --> 00:47:42.400]   But the Democrats and Republicans who hated
[00:47:42.400 --> 00:47:44.400]   each other before and hated each other after
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.400]   got together
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:48.400]   and prayed.
[00:47:48.400 --> 00:47:50.400]   And I don't know which God
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:52.400]   they prayed to, but they were desperate
[00:47:52.400 --> 00:47:54.400]   because they felt helpless
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:56.400]   and they were scared.
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:58.400]   Now for non-Christians, they pray
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.400]   when they feel helpless, but as soon
[00:48:00.400 --> 00:48:02.400]   as the emergency is over, they go back, right
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:04.400]   back into their old life, living in
[00:48:04.400 --> 00:48:06.400]   blasphemy and rebellion against God.
[00:48:06.400 --> 00:48:08.400]   But the point of everything that Paul
[00:48:08.400 --> 00:48:10.400]   says here in this text is to remind us
[00:48:10.400 --> 00:48:12.400]   how helpless we are in this spiritual
[00:48:12.400 --> 00:48:14.400]   battle. There's
[00:48:14.400 --> 00:48:16.400]   nothing that you and I can do that's
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:18.400]   going to withstand the scheme of the devil.
[00:48:18.400 --> 00:48:20.400]   That's how
[00:48:20.400 --> 00:48:22.400]   he described it, scheming.
[00:48:22.400 --> 00:48:24.400]   The devil is not just simply coming to us,
[00:48:24.400 --> 00:48:26.400]   he's scheming, he's working behind the scenes.
[00:48:26.400 --> 00:48:28.400]   So, when you are
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:30.400]   deceived, you don't know.
[00:48:30.400 --> 00:48:32.400]   You don't know.
[00:48:32.400 --> 00:48:34.400]   Some of us
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:36.400]   maybe think like, well, we're smart enough
[00:48:36.400 --> 00:48:38.400]   and we study the Bible enough so we're aware
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:40.400]   enough and I'm a good analyst and I do
[00:48:40.400 --> 00:48:42.400]   analysts for a Fortune 500 company so
[00:48:42.400 --> 00:48:44.400]   I can know.
[00:48:44.400 --> 00:48:46.400]   I'm good at reading people.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.400]   I don't know how smart you are,
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   but you're not smarter than the devil.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:52.400]   I don't know what you got in your SAT,
[00:48:52.400 --> 00:48:54.400]   but I'm pretty sure his SAT scores
[00:48:54.400 --> 00:48:56.400]   much better than yours.
[00:48:56.400 --> 00:48:58.400]   I don't know what you got in your GPA,
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   I don't know what school you came out of, I guarantee
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:02.400]   the devil is smarter than you.
[00:49:02.400 --> 00:49:04.400]   How are you, how am I
[00:49:04.400 --> 00:49:06.400]   going to withstand the scheme
[00:49:06.400 --> 00:49:08.400]   of the devil by our own strength, by our own
[00:49:08.400 --> 00:49:10.400]   intellect? That's the point he's trying to
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:12.400]   make. I don't care how
[00:49:12.400 --> 00:49:14.400]   powerful you are, I don't care how committed you
[00:49:14.400 --> 00:49:16.400]   are, I don't care how determined you
[00:49:16.400 --> 00:49:18.400]   are, how are you going to
[00:49:18.400 --> 00:49:20.400]   overpower evil forces?
[00:49:20.400 --> 00:49:22.400]   So the point that he's trying
[00:49:22.400 --> 00:49:24.400]   to make that because this is a spiritual
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:26.400]   battle, unless you engage
[00:49:26.400 --> 00:49:28.400]   in prayer, you will be
[00:49:28.400 --> 00:49:30.400]   ineffective.
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:32.400]   You're trying to conquer an
[00:49:32.400 --> 00:49:34.400]   army with
[00:49:34.400 --> 00:49:36.400]   swords.
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:38.400]   It's not going to work, you're going to fail.
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:40.400]   That's the point that he's trying to make.
[00:49:40.400 --> 00:49:42.400]   In fact,
[00:49:42.400 --> 00:49:44.400]   in Matthew 9, 36
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.400]   through 38, Jesus
[00:49:46.400 --> 00:49:48.400]   is so moved
[00:49:48.400 --> 00:49:50.400]   because he sees the multitudes.
[00:49:50.400 --> 00:49:52.400]   The very people that he came
[00:49:52.400 --> 00:49:54.400]   to sacrifice his life for, it says
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:49:56.400]   he felt compassion
[00:49:56.400 --> 00:49:58.400]   for them because they were distressed and dispirited
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:00.400]   like sheep without shepherd.
[00:50:00.400 --> 00:50:02.400]   Then he said to the disciples, "The harvest is plentiful
[00:50:02.400 --> 00:50:04.400]   but the workers are few." Let's stop right there.
[00:50:04.400 --> 00:50:06.400]   Right? Jesus
[00:50:06.400 --> 00:50:08.400]   looks at the people and he has compassion
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:10.400]   and the whole reason why he came to
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:12.400]   earth, he took on human flesh
[00:50:12.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   and was humiliated as a man
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:16.400]   is because he had compassion for us.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   Now he is face-to-face
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:20.400]   with the multitude and he says, "The
[00:50:20.400 --> 00:50:22.400]   harvest is plentiful. They're like
[00:50:22.400 --> 00:50:24.400]   sheep without shepherd. The harvest
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:26.400]   is plentiful, the workers are few."
[00:50:26.400 --> 00:50:30.400]   If we stop there, we would assume
[00:50:30.400 --> 00:50:32.400]   that we would think, "Okay,
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:34.400]   if that's the problem, what should we do?"
[00:50:34.400 --> 00:50:36.400]   We need to
[00:50:36.400 --> 00:50:38.400]   look for better shepherds.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.400]   First thing we need to do is
[00:50:40.400 --> 00:50:42.400]   form a committee.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:44.400]   A search committee
[00:50:44.400 --> 00:50:46.400]   who's going to get together and then we've got to find out
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:48.400]   what kind of pay are we going to offer them?
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.400]   How are we going to attract good shepherds
[00:50:50.400 --> 00:50:52.400]   if we don't have the right pay and right resources
[00:50:52.400 --> 00:50:54.400]   to support? We need to find
[00:50:54.400 --> 00:50:56.400]   the right people who are going to be in the right
[00:50:56.400 --> 00:50:58.400]   search committee so that they can
[00:50:58.400 --> 00:51:00.400]   make wise decisions, that they're
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:02.400]   doctrinally sound, that they're going to be able to choose
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:04.400]   people who's going to have leadership. Are they going to be able to discern?
[00:51:04.400 --> 00:51:06.400]   Do they have character issues?
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.400]   We would go through all of that and
[00:51:08.400 --> 00:51:10.400]   assess, find the right person,
[00:51:10.400 --> 00:51:12.400]   trust them, and then evaluate
[00:51:12.400 --> 00:51:14.400]   and then hopefully we'll find enough
[00:51:14.400 --> 00:51:16.400]   people to be able to meet those needs.
[00:51:16.400 --> 00:51:18.400]   That's the way that you and I would approach it
[00:51:18.400 --> 00:51:20.400]   in our generation, with our resources.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:24.400]   Jesus says, "Therefore,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:26.400]   because of this problem,"
[00:51:26.400 --> 00:51:28.400]   what does he say? "Beseech the Lord of the harvest,
[00:51:28.400 --> 00:51:30.400]   and send out workers to the harvest."
[00:51:30.400 --> 00:51:32.400]   Because there is
[00:51:32.400 --> 00:51:34.400]   a big problem, because he has compassion
[00:51:34.400 --> 00:51:36.400]   on them, because the harvest is
[00:51:36.400 --> 00:51:38.400]   plentiful and the workers are few,
[00:51:38.400 --> 00:51:40.400]   the first thing that he says, in fact
[00:51:40.400 --> 00:51:42.400]   the only thing that he says here,
[00:51:42.400 --> 00:51:44.400]   is to pray.
[00:51:44.400 --> 00:51:46.400]   Pray.
[00:51:46.400 --> 00:51:48.400]   What problem are you wrestling
[00:51:48.400 --> 00:51:50.400]   with now,
[00:51:50.400 --> 00:51:52.400]   that you are trying to fix, assess?
[00:51:52.400 --> 00:51:54.400]   What is the problem? You know, I've been so dry
[00:51:54.400 --> 00:51:56.400]   spiritually and
[00:51:56.400 --> 00:51:58.400]   so lost, you know, I'm looking for
[00:51:58.400 --> 00:52:00.400]   counseling. Maybe
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:02.400]   a book if I read it.
[00:52:02.400 --> 00:52:04.400]   Maybe if I had an older sister or brother,
[00:52:04.400 --> 00:52:06.400]   or maybe if our ministry had this kind
[00:52:06.400 --> 00:52:08.400]   of resources, and did all of that, and if we
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:10.400]   had a committee, and you're looking for
[00:52:10.400 --> 00:52:12.400]   all these solutions, and yet you're not
[00:52:12.400 --> 00:52:14.400]   praying.
[00:52:14.400 --> 00:52:16.400]   The first and the most important
[00:52:16.400 --> 00:52:18.400]   thing that any Christian
[00:52:18.400 --> 00:52:20.400]   needs to engage in is prayer.
[00:52:20.400 --> 00:52:22.400]   So, before we look
[00:52:22.400 --> 00:52:24.400]   for solutions, before we complain,
[00:52:24.400 --> 00:52:26.400]   before we're
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.400]   griping, are we
[00:52:28.400 --> 00:52:30.400]   praying?
[00:52:30.400 --> 00:52:32.400]   Maybe,
[00:52:32.400 --> 00:52:34.400]   maybe, before God
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.400]   can satisfy your longing,
[00:52:36.400 --> 00:52:38.400]   He's waiting for you
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.400]   to come to Him.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.400]   To pray.
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:44.400]   To pray, pray, pray, pray.
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:46.400]   To pray in the Spirit,
[00:52:46.400 --> 00:52:48.400]   to engage in the Spirit, to beseech
[00:52:48.400 --> 00:52:50.400]   the Lord of the harvest.
[00:52:50.400 --> 00:52:52.400]   So, my general rule for
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:54.400]   my life,
[00:52:54.400 --> 00:52:56.400]   don't complain unless
[00:52:56.400 --> 00:52:58.400]   I am confident that I have prayed enough.
[00:52:58.400 --> 00:53:02.400]   Because, if I haven't prayed enough,
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.400]   that may be the reason why I feel the way
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:06.400]   I feel. That may be the
[00:53:06.400 --> 00:53:08.400]   reason why we're not bearing fruit. That may be
[00:53:08.400 --> 00:53:10.400]   the reason why certain things aren't going on.
[00:53:10.400 --> 00:53:12.400]   Until I pray. Pray,
[00:53:12.400 --> 00:53:14.400]   pray, pray, pray, pray. First
[00:53:14.400 --> 00:53:16.400]   and foremost.
[00:53:16.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   If you didn't pray, don't look for
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.400]   human solutions.
[00:53:20.400 --> 00:53:22.400]   If you didn't engage in prayer, don't
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:24.400]   think you have the answers, because you don't.
[00:53:24.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   Because you're not able to see things
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:28.400]   from the Spirit's eyes.
[00:53:28.400 --> 00:53:30.400]   Until you pray,
[00:53:30.400 --> 00:53:32.400]   pride, ultimately,
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:34.400]   is the biggest reason
[00:53:34.400 --> 00:53:36.400]   why we are ineffective.
[00:53:36.400 --> 00:53:38.400]   Pride.
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:40.400]   Some of you guys know that during my sabbatical
[00:53:40.400 --> 00:53:42.400]   that I took, I
[00:53:42.400 --> 00:53:44.400]   went and got a motorcycle license.
[00:53:44.400 --> 00:53:46.400]   Some of you guys know, some of you guys don't know.
[00:53:46.400 --> 00:53:48.400]   Esther gave me permission.
[00:53:48.400 --> 00:53:50.400]   She said,
[00:53:50.400 --> 00:53:52.400]   "If you had the opportunity to do
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:54.400]   whatever you want, you weren't worried
[00:53:54.400 --> 00:53:56.400]   about what other people think,
[00:53:56.400 --> 00:53:58.400]   what would you do?" And I said, "Motorcycle."
[00:53:58.400 --> 00:54:00.400]   That was my dream since I was
[00:54:00.400 --> 00:54:02.400]   15.
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.400]   So I went and a friend
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:06.400]   that I knew was selling his
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.400]   motorcycle for a cheap price, and I got it.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.400]   So I was thinking I was going to live
[00:54:10.400 --> 00:54:12.400]   out my dream for three months.
[00:54:12.400 --> 00:54:14.400]   And then after I'm done, I'm going to fix the bike
[00:54:14.400 --> 00:54:16.400]   and I'm going to resell it, and so it's not going to cost me
[00:54:16.400 --> 00:54:18.400]   any money. So my
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:20.400]   wife was crazy. I think she was more crazy than I was
[00:54:20.400 --> 00:54:22.400]   because she was pushing me to get it, so I got it.
[00:54:22.400 --> 00:54:24.400]   And I remember taking the motorcycle
[00:54:24.400 --> 00:54:26.400]   class, and they would tell me
[00:54:26.400 --> 00:54:28.400]   that 95%
[00:54:28.400 --> 00:54:30.400]   of all motorcycle accidents
[00:54:30.400 --> 00:54:32.400]   happen in the first year. So obviously
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:34.400]   that freaked me out.
[00:54:34.400 --> 00:54:36.400]   So for the first year,
[00:54:36.400 --> 00:54:38.400]   every time I went somewhere, and I
[00:54:38.400 --> 00:54:40.400]   of course, I never rode it to church,
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.400]   only during the weekdays, so only the pastors
[00:54:42.400 --> 00:54:44.400]   have seen me on this bike.
[00:54:44.400 --> 00:54:46.400]   And one other person, yeah.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:48.400]   But
[00:54:48.400 --> 00:54:50.400]   I would write it because he told me that
[00:54:50.400 --> 00:54:52.400]   95% of all accidents happen in the first year,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.400]   and I'm in the beginning of the first year, so
[00:54:54.400 --> 00:54:56.400]   everywhere I went, I was so
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:58.400]   cautious. And if it
[00:54:58.400 --> 00:55:00.400]   looked like the, you know how the yellow
[00:55:00.400 --> 00:55:02.400]   light may be coming on? If you're in a car,
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.400]   you kind of speed up to get. I see that
[00:55:04.400 --> 00:55:06.400]   two blocks away, and I'm already braking.
[00:55:06.400 --> 00:55:08.400]   You know what I mean?
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:10.400]   But when it was dangerous
[00:55:10.400 --> 00:55:12.400]   was not the beginning. When it was
[00:55:12.400 --> 00:55:14.400]   dangerous was at the end of that year,
[00:55:14.400 --> 00:55:16.400]   I started getting a bit more confident.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   After going
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:20.400]   30 miles per hour in the beginning,
[00:55:20.400 --> 00:55:22.400]   oh my gosh, you fall off and you die.
[00:55:22.400 --> 00:55:24.400]   After a while, you go 40,
[00:55:24.400 --> 00:55:26.400]   it doesn't feel as bad. After you got 60, and then
[00:55:26.400 --> 00:55:28.400]   I'm going to get on the freeway,
[00:55:28.400 --> 00:55:30.400]   and it's like scared to death, and then after
[00:55:30.400 --> 00:55:32.400]   a while, you get even comfortable going
[00:55:32.400 --> 00:55:34.400]   60, 70.
[00:55:34.400 --> 00:55:36.400]   When it got really dangerous was at
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:38.400]   the end, the tail end of that, I saw a
[00:55:38.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   yellow light coming, and I said, "I can pass this."
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:42.400]   Instead of braking, I started
[00:55:42.400 --> 00:55:44.400]   speeding up until I got right there,
[00:55:44.400 --> 00:55:46.400]   and I saw all the cars.
[00:55:46.400 --> 00:55:48.400]   And that freaked me out, and then so I
[00:55:48.400 --> 00:55:50.400]   decided to step on my brake,
[00:55:50.400 --> 00:55:52.400]   and because it's not like
[00:55:52.400 --> 00:55:54.400]   a car where you can step on the brake and it just kind of
[00:55:54.400 --> 00:55:56.400]   stops. If you brake like that on
[00:55:56.400 --> 00:55:58.400]   a motorcycle, you're sliding.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   So I, again,
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.400]   in my confidence,
[00:56:02.400 --> 00:56:04.400]   I started going, and I realized
[00:56:04.400 --> 00:56:06.400]   I didn't have time, and I stepped on the brake,
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:08.400]   and the bike just went out under me.
[00:56:08.400 --> 00:56:10.400]   I didn't fall.
[00:56:10.400 --> 00:56:12.400]   By the grace of God, it was
[00:56:12.400 --> 00:56:14.400]   starting to skid, and I said, "Oh
[00:56:14.400 --> 00:56:16.400]   shoot, I'm going to get in an accident."
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:18.400]   And that would have slid me into the middle of the
[00:56:18.400 --> 00:56:20.400]   intersection if that happened.
[00:56:20.400 --> 00:56:22.400]   But as that was happening, I kind of twisted, and
[00:56:22.400 --> 00:56:24.400]   I was shaking back and forth, and I was
[00:56:24.400 --> 00:56:26.400]   able to get my equilibrium, and I did
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.400]   skid into the middle of the road, and I
[00:56:28.400 --> 00:56:30.400]   sheepishly, in
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:32.400]   humility,
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:34.400]   walked my bike
[00:56:34.400 --> 00:56:36.400]   back with all the
[00:56:36.400 --> 00:56:38.400]   drivers looking at me like, "This fool."
[00:56:38.400 --> 00:56:40.400]   [laughter]
[00:56:40.400 --> 00:56:42.400]   Good thing I had my helmet on so nobody saw me.
[00:56:42.400 --> 00:56:44.400]   [laughter]
[00:56:44.400 --> 00:56:46.400]   But I remember after that, I was like,
[00:56:46.400 --> 00:56:48.400]   "Wow." I almost
[00:56:48.400 --> 00:56:50.400]   got in an accident
[00:56:50.400 --> 00:56:52.400]   because I started getting confident.
[00:56:52.400 --> 00:56:54.400]   I know how to ride this
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:56.400]   bike. I'm a veteran now. I'm not
[00:56:56.400 --> 00:56:58.400]   going to be one of those 95%,
[00:56:58.400 --> 00:57:00.400]   because I've almost made it out of the first year.
[00:57:00.400 --> 00:57:02.400]   But I realized when I was
[00:57:02.400 --> 00:57:04.400]   the most dangerous is when I started getting confident.
[00:57:04.400 --> 00:57:06.400]   Instead of
[00:57:06.400 --> 00:57:08.400]   taking precautions and knowing the
[00:57:08.400 --> 00:57:10.400]   danger of riding this bike
[00:57:10.400 --> 00:57:12.400]   is when I started feeling safe.
[00:57:12.400 --> 00:57:14.400]   The point that Paul
[00:57:14.400 --> 00:57:16.400]   was trying to make is that in your
[00:57:16.400 --> 00:57:18.400]   flesh, you are not safe.
[00:57:18.400 --> 00:57:20.400]   There is an
[00:57:20.400 --> 00:57:22.400]   enemy prowling around like a roaring
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.400]   lion seeking someone to devour,
[00:57:24.400 --> 00:57:26.400]   and in the middle of that, you feel at peace.
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:28.400]   You feel
[00:57:28.400 --> 00:57:30.400]   confident that what you're doing is
[00:57:30.400 --> 00:57:32.400]   okay. You're fighting, and then you're
[00:57:32.400 --> 00:57:34.400]   smart, and you have experience, and you know
[00:57:34.400 --> 00:57:36.400]   what you're doing. That's when
[00:57:36.400 --> 00:57:38.400]   you are in trouble.
[00:57:38.400 --> 00:57:40.400]   When he thinks he stands
[00:57:40.400 --> 00:57:42.400]   in the flesh,
[00:57:42.400 --> 00:57:44.400]   that is when he is the weakest.
[00:57:44.400 --> 00:57:46.400]   And that's why he's
[00:57:46.400 --> 00:57:48.400]   reminding the readers.
[00:57:48.400 --> 00:57:50.400]   After you know all of this, he says, "Pray,
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:52.400]   pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:57:52.400 --> 00:57:54.400]   In Revelation
[00:57:54.400 --> 00:57:56.400]   3.1, it says to the angel of the church in Sardis,
[00:57:56.400 --> 00:57:58.400]   "He who has seven spirits of
[00:57:58.400 --> 00:58:00.400]   God and the seven stars says this, 'I
[00:58:00.400 --> 00:58:02.400]   know your deeds, that you have the name that you are
[00:58:02.400 --> 00:58:04.400]   alive, but you are dead.'"
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.400]   You have a
[00:58:06.400 --> 00:58:08.400]   reputation of being alive. Everybody sees
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:10.400]   you and says, "Wow, you're such a spiritual person.
[00:58:10.400 --> 00:58:12.400]   You know the Bible. You disciple so
[00:58:12.400 --> 00:58:14.400]   many people." And so you have
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:16.400]   a reputation of being alive, but yet
[00:58:16.400 --> 00:58:18.400]   the assessment of God is that
[00:58:18.400 --> 00:58:20.400]   you're dead.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:22.400]   It's not somebody who's
[00:58:22.400 --> 00:58:24.400]   getting, or reputation of getting an A
[00:58:24.400 --> 00:58:26.400]   is that, "No, you're not an A student. You're an A-
[00:58:26.400 --> 00:58:28.400]   minus student, or you're a B student, or maybe
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:30.400]   you're a C student." He says, "No.
[00:58:30.400 --> 00:58:32.400]   Everybody thinks you're alive,
[00:58:32.400 --> 00:58:34.400]   but in God's eyes, you're
[00:58:34.400 --> 00:58:36.400]   dead."
[00:58:36.400 --> 00:58:38.400]   You have a form of
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:40.400]   godliness, yet no power.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:42.400]   Everything you know about
[00:58:42.400 --> 00:58:44.400]   God is a theory.
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:46.400]   So everything, every testimony
[00:58:46.400 --> 00:58:48.400]   that you have is someone else's, that you're
[00:58:48.400 --> 00:58:50.400]   regurgitating something that you read, or a sermon
[00:58:50.400 --> 00:58:52.400]   that you heard, or illustration,
[00:58:52.400 --> 00:58:54.400]   but it's not you.
[00:58:54.400 --> 00:58:56.400]   You've
[00:58:56.400 --> 00:58:58.400]   never encountered God.
[00:58:58.400 --> 00:59:00.400]   So, you are
[00:59:00.400 --> 00:59:02.400]   regurgitating
[00:59:02.400 --> 00:59:04.400]   information, you're passing
[00:59:04.400 --> 00:59:06.400]   on things that you've learned,
[00:59:06.400 --> 00:59:08.400]   but it's not you.
[00:59:08.400 --> 00:59:10.400]   That's why he says to pray,
[00:59:10.400 --> 00:59:12.400]   pray, pray, pray. In James
[00:59:12.400 --> 00:59:14.400]   chapter 4, too, it says, "You do not have because
[00:59:14.400 --> 00:59:16.400]   you do not ask."
[00:59:16.400 --> 00:59:18.400]   So, when we ask ourselves, "Why do we not pray?"
[00:59:18.400 --> 00:59:20.400]   Knowing that we have direct
[00:59:20.400 --> 00:59:22.400]   access to God.
[00:59:22.400 --> 00:59:24.400]   If I told you Bill Gates was in town,
[00:59:24.400 --> 00:59:26.400]   is he outdated? He's probably
[00:59:26.400 --> 00:59:28.400]   outdated, right?
[00:59:28.400 --> 00:59:30.400]   Mark Zuckerberg?
[00:59:30.400 --> 00:59:32.400]   Somebody rich, right?
[00:59:32.400 --> 00:59:34.400]   If I told you
[00:59:34.400 --> 00:59:36.400]   he was in town, and he said
[00:59:36.400 --> 00:59:38.400]   to come and ask,
[00:59:38.400 --> 00:59:40.400]   how many of you would hesitate to run
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:42.400]   to him?
[00:59:42.400 --> 00:59:44.400]   Oh, we get to
[00:59:44.400 --> 00:59:46.400]   ask? And he said, "Whatever, whatever you ask."
[00:59:46.400 --> 00:59:48.400]   We have access to God
[00:59:48.400 --> 00:59:50.400]   and we don't go.
[00:59:50.400 --> 00:59:52.400]   We have access to God who created
[00:59:52.400 --> 00:59:54.400]   the universe. He makes Zuckerberg
[00:59:54.400 --> 00:59:56.400]   look like he's in poverty.
[00:59:56.400 --> 00:59:58.400]   And yet, we don't
[00:59:58.400 --> 01:00:00.400]   go. So, why don't we go? One,
[01:00:00.400 --> 01:00:02.400]   maybe we don't believe.
[01:00:02.400 --> 01:00:04.400]   And that's a simple answer. Maybe we don't
[01:00:04.400 --> 01:00:06.400]   believe. Or two,
[01:00:06.400 --> 01:00:08.400]   maybe we don't ask because
[01:00:08.400 --> 01:00:10.400]   our desires
[01:00:10.400 --> 01:00:12.400]   that we
[01:00:12.400 --> 01:00:14.400]   want to ask, we already know
[01:00:14.400 --> 01:00:16.400]   that that's not what God wants for us.
[01:00:16.400 --> 01:00:18.400]   So,
[01:00:18.400 --> 01:00:20.400]   our hearts are filled with things that contradict
[01:00:20.400 --> 01:00:22.400]   the things that God desires for us, so we
[01:00:22.400 --> 01:00:24.400]   can't take that to God.
[01:00:24.400 --> 01:00:26.400]   You're theologically too astute.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:28.400]   You don't believe in the health and wealth gospel.
[01:00:28.400 --> 01:00:30.400]   So, you've already learned enough about the Bible
[01:00:30.400 --> 01:00:32.400]   to keep you away from
[01:00:32.400 --> 01:00:34.400]   God. Not to bring
[01:00:34.400 --> 01:00:36.400]   you to God.
[01:00:36.400 --> 01:00:38.400]   But theology causes you to stay
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:40.400]   away from God because your life is not consistent
[01:00:40.400 --> 01:00:42.400]   with the things that you're learning. So,
[01:00:42.400 --> 01:00:44.400]   therefore, the more you learn about God,
[01:00:44.400 --> 01:00:46.400]   the more you have to stay away from God.
[01:00:46.400 --> 01:00:48.400]   So, it is your
[01:00:48.400 --> 01:00:50.400]   astute theology that prevents
[01:00:50.400 --> 01:00:52.400]   you from praying.
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.400]   Because this theology,
[01:00:54.400 --> 01:00:56.400]   if it doesn't cause you to be broken
[01:00:56.400 --> 01:00:58.400]   and humble and desire and to go to Him,
[01:00:58.400 --> 01:01:00.400]   then it does exactly the
[01:01:00.400 --> 01:01:02.400]   opposite.
[01:01:02.400 --> 01:01:04.400]   We do not have because we do not pray.
[01:01:04.400 --> 01:01:06.400]   And He says, "Even when you do pray,
[01:01:06.400 --> 01:01:08.400]   you do not receive because you ask with wrong
[01:01:08.400 --> 01:01:10.400]   motives so that you may spend it on your
[01:01:10.400 --> 01:01:12.400]   pleasure." The very thing
[01:01:12.400 --> 01:01:14.400]   that God doesn't want you to have.
[01:01:14.400 --> 01:01:16.400]   Your heart's
[01:01:16.400 --> 01:01:18.400]   filled with that. So, even if you're bold
[01:01:18.400 --> 01:01:20.400]   enough to go and ask Him,
[01:01:20.400 --> 01:01:22.400]   He said, "God can't give it to you because He knows He's
[01:01:22.400 --> 01:01:24.400]   going to destroy you." Those of you
[01:01:24.400 --> 01:01:26.400]   who are stingy,
[01:01:26.400 --> 01:01:28.400]   don't ask for money.
[01:01:28.400 --> 01:01:30.400]   It will destroy
[01:01:30.400 --> 01:01:32.400]   you.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.400]   It will destroy you. Those of you
[01:01:34.400 --> 01:01:36.400]   who are not generous,
[01:01:36.400 --> 01:01:38.400]   don't ask for money.
[01:01:38.400 --> 01:01:40.400]   Because the money that you get
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.400]   is going to fill you with
[01:01:42.400 --> 01:01:44.400]   pride and arrogance
[01:01:44.400 --> 01:01:46.400]   and pleasure that's going to drive you away from
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.400]   God so God's not going to answer a prayer
[01:01:48.400 --> 01:01:50.400]   that's going to ultimately ruin you.
[01:01:50.400 --> 01:01:52.400]   So, if you're stingy and you're not good
[01:01:52.400 --> 01:01:54.400]   at managing money and all the money is
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.400]   being spent for your own pleasure,
[01:01:56.400 --> 01:01:58.400]   don't ask God
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:00.400]   to make your business better.
[01:02:00.400 --> 01:02:04.400]   "God, when is the right time to buy
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:06.400]   a house so that I can make a good investment and make
[01:02:06.400 --> 01:02:08.400]   more money?" Because more money to you
[01:02:08.400 --> 01:02:10.400]   is going to ruin you.
[01:02:10.400 --> 01:02:12.400]   That's what He says. Either we don't pray,
[01:02:12.400 --> 01:02:14.400]   or when we do pray, God can't
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:16.400]   answer that. A Christian who is
[01:02:16.400 --> 01:02:18.400]   content without prayer is a
[01:02:18.400 --> 01:02:20.400]   very dangerous person.
[01:02:20.400 --> 01:02:22.400]   Because whatever success
[01:02:22.400 --> 01:02:24.400]   he experiences without
[01:02:24.400 --> 01:02:26.400]   prayer is going to ruin him.
[01:02:26.400 --> 01:02:28.400]   Because he thinks he's done it.
[01:02:28.400 --> 01:02:30.400]   I did it.
[01:02:30.400 --> 01:02:32.400]   I made these changes and I made these implementations
[01:02:32.400 --> 01:02:34.400]   and I worked hard and I was properly
[01:02:34.400 --> 01:02:36.400]   educated and therefore this is what's
[01:02:36.400 --> 01:02:38.400]   happening and so you're filled with pride.
[01:02:38.400 --> 01:02:40.400]   So a Christian who is filled with pride automatically
[01:02:40.400 --> 01:02:42.400]   becomes a critical Christian.
[01:02:42.400 --> 01:02:44.400]   Not only am I good,
[01:02:44.400 --> 01:02:46.400]   you don't live up to my standard.
[01:02:46.400 --> 01:02:48.400]   So it ruins that
[01:02:48.400 --> 01:02:50.400]   person. A worse
[01:02:50.400 --> 01:02:52.400]   thing a Christian can experience is
[01:02:52.400 --> 01:02:54.400]   superficial success without
[01:02:54.400 --> 01:02:56.400]   Christ.
[01:02:56.400 --> 01:02:58.400]   Because the more successful you are,
[01:02:58.400 --> 01:03:00.400]   the more it drives
[01:03:00.400 --> 01:03:02.400]   you away from God.
[01:03:02.400 --> 01:03:04.400]   The best thing
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:06.400]   that can happen to any Christian is
[01:03:06.400 --> 01:03:08.400]   whatever causes us to get on our knees.
[01:03:08.400 --> 01:03:12.400]   Whatever causes us
[01:03:12.400 --> 01:03:14.400]   to feel helpless
[01:03:14.400 --> 01:03:16.400]   is the best thing.
[01:03:16.400 --> 01:03:18.400]   Whatever
[01:03:18.400 --> 01:03:20.400]   causes you to pray, whatever
[01:03:20.400 --> 01:03:22.400]   causes you to come before God, beating
[01:03:22.400 --> 01:03:24.400]   the chest saying, "I need you.
[01:03:24.400 --> 01:03:26.400]   I need you."
[01:03:26.400 --> 01:03:28.400]   Not just want you, I need you.
[01:03:28.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   Whatever causes you to be
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:32.400]   in that situation
[01:03:32.400 --> 01:03:34.400]   is what God is constantly
[01:03:34.400 --> 01:03:36.400]   driving us to.
[01:03:36.400 --> 01:03:38.400]   My hope and prayer is that
[01:03:38.400 --> 01:03:40.400]   I would not have to be forced
[01:03:40.400 --> 01:03:42.400]   to be on that situation.
[01:03:42.400 --> 01:03:44.400]   But I would be sober enough when I wake up
[01:03:44.400 --> 01:03:46.400]   that I would feel helpless, not only
[01:03:46.400 --> 01:03:48.400]   sick, not only when I feel like
[01:03:48.400 --> 01:03:50.400]   my plans didn't go right, but every day
[01:03:50.400 --> 01:03:52.400]   I wake up knowing the spiritual
[01:03:52.400 --> 01:03:54.400]   battle that we're in that I
[01:03:54.400 --> 01:03:56.400]   feel helpless.
[01:03:56.400 --> 01:03:58.400]   And that my helplessness
[01:03:58.400 --> 01:04:00.400]   would cause me to pray.
[01:04:00.400 --> 01:04:02.400]   That every
[01:04:02.400 --> 01:04:04.400]   single day, every single Christian wake up
[01:04:04.400 --> 01:04:06.400]   knowing that we have an adversary
[01:04:06.400 --> 01:04:10.400]   who is eagerly waiting to devour
[01:04:10.400 --> 01:04:12.400]   us. Now you and I
[01:04:12.400 --> 01:04:14.400]   do not have the human power
[01:04:14.400 --> 01:04:16.400]   to resist it.
[01:04:16.400 --> 01:04:18.400]   And to know that every day,
[01:04:18.400 --> 01:04:20.400]   wake up every morning knowing that, that would
[01:04:20.400 --> 01:04:22.400]   drive us to Him.
[01:04:22.400 --> 01:04:24.400]   That is the safest
[01:04:24.400 --> 01:04:26.400]   and the healthiest
[01:04:26.400 --> 01:04:28.400]   place for any Christian to be.
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:30.400]   To desperately need
[01:04:30.400 --> 01:04:32.400]   prayer. To not be
[01:04:32.400 --> 01:04:34.400]   praying regularly and then somebody
[01:04:34.400 --> 01:04:36.400]   asks you, "How are you doing?" And you say,
[01:04:36.400 --> 01:04:38.400]   "Good."
[01:04:38.400 --> 01:04:40.400]   You're in danger.
[01:04:40.400 --> 01:04:42.400]   Because you don't know
[01:04:42.400 --> 01:04:44.400]   the attacks that you're under. You don't know the
[01:04:44.400 --> 01:04:46.400]   scheming that you've already surrendered to.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:48.400]   If you say, "I'm good."
[01:04:48.400 --> 01:04:50.400]   And you don't have
[01:04:50.400 --> 01:04:52.400]   the armor of God on.
[01:04:52.400 --> 01:04:54.400]   It says, "To gird up your loins."
[01:04:54.400 --> 01:04:56.400]   Right? To engage in the
[01:04:56.400 --> 01:04:58.400]   spiritual battle, you need to gird up your loins. You know what
[01:04:58.400 --> 01:05:00.400]   girding up the loins literally means?
[01:05:00.400 --> 01:05:02.400]   It's to make your skirt into
[01:05:02.400 --> 01:05:04.400]   a pants. That's what that means.
[01:05:04.400 --> 01:05:06.400]   Right? Those are my words, but if you look at the pictures,
[01:05:06.400 --> 01:05:08.400]   that's what it is. You know, they're wearing these long
[01:05:08.400 --> 01:05:10.400]   gowns, and basically you take the back
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:12.400]   part out. I mean, we see some of the ladies
[01:05:12.400 --> 01:05:14.400]   do that, right? When they're ready to make kimchi
[01:05:14.400 --> 01:05:16.400]   or something.
[01:05:16.400 --> 01:05:18.400]   They got it on the ground, ready for action.
[01:05:18.400 --> 01:05:20.400]   You got to tie it up and tie the side.
[01:05:20.400 --> 01:05:22.400]   And basically, if you look at it, you turn the
[01:05:22.400 --> 01:05:24.400]   skirt into a pants.
[01:05:24.400 --> 01:05:26.400]   Because you need to get ready
[01:05:26.400 --> 01:05:28.400]   for action.
[01:05:28.400 --> 01:05:30.400]   That's what that literally means. To get ready for
[01:05:30.400 --> 01:05:32.400]   action. So, if you're living your life
[01:05:32.400 --> 01:05:34.400]   on vacation,
[01:05:34.400 --> 01:05:36.400]   you don't have to worry
[01:05:36.400 --> 01:05:38.400]   about action.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.400]   You know, if you're going to go into battle
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:42.400]   and you're going to fight, you don't want your
[01:05:42.400 --> 01:05:44.400]   clothing flapping around.
[01:05:44.400 --> 01:05:46.400]   You're going to be ready, right? And that's why
[01:05:46.400 --> 01:05:48.400]   in Job chapter 38, verse 3,
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.400]   Job, at the end of his
[01:05:50.400 --> 01:05:52.400]   life, is just so tired, and he's
[01:05:52.400 --> 01:05:54.400]   complaining to God, and God finally shows
[01:05:54.400 --> 01:05:56.400]   up, and this is what he said, "Now gird
[01:05:56.400 --> 01:05:58.400]   up your loins like a man."
[01:05:58.400 --> 01:06:00.400]   Right? In other words, again,
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.400]   just put on your big boy pants,
[01:06:02.400 --> 01:06:04.400]   because I got some things
[01:06:04.400 --> 01:06:06.400]   to say to you. Right?
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:08.400]   "Gird up your loins like a man,
[01:06:08.400 --> 01:06:10.400]   and I will ask you, and you instruct
[01:06:10.400 --> 01:06:12.400]   me. You're so bold
[01:06:12.400 --> 01:06:14.400]   to tell me what I'm doing wrong. Now
[01:06:14.400 --> 01:06:16.400]   I'm here. Put on your pants.
[01:06:16.400 --> 01:06:18.400]   Tell me.
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.400]   Tell me, now that I'm in front of you."
[01:06:20.400 --> 01:06:22.400]   So he goes through a series
[01:06:22.400 --> 01:06:24.400]   of things that God's going to
[01:06:24.400 --> 01:06:26.400]   show him who he is, and
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:28.400]   every statement that he makes, he says,
[01:06:28.400 --> 01:06:30.400]   first of all, "Gird up your loins like a man."
[01:06:30.400 --> 01:06:32.400]   Right? "Put your pants on."
[01:06:32.400 --> 01:06:34.400]   Right?
[01:06:34.400 --> 01:06:36.400]   That's what he says. First and foremost,
[01:06:36.400 --> 01:06:38.400]   praying the Spirit means to be ready.
[01:06:38.400 --> 01:06:40.400]   If you're going into
[01:06:40.400 --> 01:06:42.400]   2024, and you made a bucket
[01:06:42.400 --> 01:06:44.400]   list of things that you want to experience,
[01:06:44.400 --> 01:06:46.400]   the food that you want to taste, and the
[01:06:46.400 --> 01:06:48.400]   places that you want to go, and none of that
[01:06:48.400 --> 01:06:50.400]   has anything to do with the spiritual
[01:06:50.400 --> 01:06:52.400]   battle, then maybe
[01:06:52.400 --> 01:06:54.400]   it's time to gird up your loins.
[01:06:54.400 --> 01:06:56.400]   Right?
[01:06:56.400 --> 01:06:58.400]   That we need to begin by
[01:06:58.400 --> 01:07:00.400]   reminding ourselves
[01:07:00.400 --> 01:07:02.400]   that we're in spiritual battle.
[01:07:02.400 --> 01:07:04.400]   We're in war.
[01:07:04.400 --> 01:07:06.400]   In Jeremiah 1:17, when
[01:07:06.400 --> 01:07:08.400]   God calls him to battle, he said, "You're going to
[01:07:08.400 --> 01:07:10.400]   go, and you're
[01:07:10.400 --> 01:07:12.400]   going to preach my word,
[01:07:12.400 --> 01:07:14.400]   and tell them that because
[01:07:14.400 --> 01:07:16.400]   of their sin, judgment is coming."
[01:07:16.400 --> 01:07:18.400]   He tells Jeremiah, "Now gird up your loins, and
[01:07:18.400 --> 01:07:20.400]   arise, and speak to them all, which I command
[01:07:20.400 --> 01:07:22.400]   you. Do not be dismayed before them,
[01:07:22.400 --> 01:07:24.400]   or I will dismay you before them."
[01:07:24.400 --> 01:07:28.400]   God is
[01:07:28.400 --> 01:07:30.400]   preparing Jeremiah to
[01:07:30.400 --> 01:07:32.400]   face the hostility of the people that
[01:07:32.400 --> 01:07:34.400]   he will be preaching the word to,
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:36.400]   and they're going to hate his guts.
[01:07:36.400 --> 01:07:38.400]   Jeremiah, the weeping prophet,
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.400]   every time that guy opens his mouth, he has nothing
[01:07:40.400 --> 01:07:42.400]   good to say. He's not encouraging at all.
[01:07:42.400 --> 01:07:44.400]   He's not seeker-friendly.
[01:07:44.400 --> 01:07:46.400]   He's seeker-hostile.
[01:07:46.400 --> 01:07:48.400]   Every time he opens his mouth, nobody is happy,
[01:07:48.400 --> 01:07:50.400]   but that's the message that God gave him,
[01:07:50.400 --> 01:07:52.400]   and that's why he said, "Gird up
[01:07:52.400 --> 01:07:54.400]   your loins. I'm not sending you on
[01:07:54.400 --> 01:07:56.400]   vacation. I'm not sending you on a cruise ship
[01:07:56.400 --> 01:07:58.400]   to kind of encourage people.
[01:07:58.400 --> 01:08:00.400]   I'm going to send you to these people who's
[01:08:00.400 --> 01:08:02.400]   going to hate your guts because of the message I'm giving
[01:08:02.400 --> 01:08:04.400]   you, so gird up your loins.
[01:08:04.400 --> 01:08:06.400]   Get ready for action."
[01:08:06.400 --> 01:08:08.400]   In Luke chapter 12,
[01:08:08.400 --> 01:08:10.400]   35-36, "Be dressed in readiness
[01:08:10.400 --> 01:08:12.400]   and keep your lamp lit.
[01:08:12.400 --> 01:08:14.400]   Be like men who are waiting for their
[01:08:14.400 --> 01:08:16.400]   master when he returns from the wedding feast
[01:08:16.400 --> 01:08:18.400]   so that they may immediately open the door to
[01:08:18.400 --> 01:08:20.400]   him when he comes and knocks."
[01:08:20.400 --> 01:08:24.400]   Are you preparing 2024
[01:08:24.400 --> 01:08:26.400]   for the spiritual battle that
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:28.400]   you're going to have already been called to?
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:32.400]   He says to gird up your loins. Be ready.
[01:08:32.400 --> 01:08:34.400]   And that's why he says to put on
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:36.400]   the full armor of God.
[01:08:36.400 --> 01:08:38.400]   Not just pieces,
[01:08:38.400 --> 01:08:40.400]   not just the sword,
[01:08:40.400 --> 01:08:42.400]   but the full armor of God.
[01:08:42.400 --> 01:08:44.400]   Now, if we're just playing house,
[01:08:44.400 --> 01:08:46.400]   if you're going to Disneyland and you're dressed up
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:48.400]   like a warrior to entertain
[01:08:48.400 --> 01:08:50.400]   people, then it doesn't matter.
[01:08:50.400 --> 01:08:52.400]   You may have your legs vulnerable,
[01:08:52.400 --> 01:08:54.400]   your chest vulnerable, your side vulnerable.
[01:08:54.400 --> 01:08:56.400]   It doesn't matter because it's just for show.
[01:08:56.400 --> 01:08:58.400]   But if you're actually dressing up for battle,
[01:08:58.400 --> 01:09:00.400]   you know that your enemy is
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:02.400]   going to see whatever areas of your
[01:09:02.400 --> 01:09:04.400]   life that's vulnerable, and you know
[01:09:04.400 --> 01:09:06.400]   that's where the attack is coming.
[01:09:06.400 --> 01:09:08.400]   If you're struggling with
[01:09:08.400 --> 01:09:10.400]   purity, that's where the attack
[01:09:10.400 --> 01:09:12.400]   is going to keep coming. If you're a problem
[01:09:12.400 --> 01:09:14.400]   with his money, that's where the
[01:09:14.400 --> 01:09:16.400]   attack is going to keep coming. Because the
[01:09:16.400 --> 01:09:18.400]   enemy is constantly scheming.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.400]   If your idol
[01:09:20.400 --> 01:09:22.400]   is your children, that's where
[01:09:22.400 --> 01:09:24.400]   the attack is going to keep coming.
[01:09:24.400 --> 01:09:26.400]   Wherever the armor
[01:09:26.400 --> 01:09:28.400]   is vulnerable is where the
[01:09:28.400 --> 01:09:30.400]   enemy is going to
[01:09:30.400 --> 01:09:32.400]   be placing his sword.
[01:09:32.400 --> 01:09:34.400]   And that's why he says put on
[01:09:34.400 --> 01:09:36.400]   the full armor of God.
[01:09:36.400 --> 01:09:38.400]   Gird up your loins, put on
[01:09:38.400 --> 01:09:40.400]   the feet, preparation for the gospel
[01:09:40.400 --> 01:09:42.400]   of peace.
[01:09:42.400 --> 01:09:44.400]   Be ready for action.
[01:09:44.400 --> 01:09:46.400]   You could tell
[01:09:46.400 --> 01:09:48.400]   what, like,
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.400]   when my kids dress up to go out, I know exactly
[01:09:50.400 --> 01:09:52.400]   what they're applying to.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.400]   If they put on slippers,
[01:09:54.400 --> 01:09:56.400]   and I said, oh, they're going to
[01:09:56.400 --> 01:09:58.400]   hang out with their friends, or maybe they're going to go
[01:09:58.400 --> 01:10:00.400]   bowling, or, you know,
[01:10:00.400 --> 01:10:02.400]   even for bowling you need proper shoes, right?
[01:10:02.400 --> 01:10:04.400]   If they're wearing slippers out of the house,
[01:10:04.400 --> 01:10:06.400]   they're not going to do anything active. But I know when they're
[01:10:06.400 --> 01:10:08.400]   going to go play sports or something,
[01:10:08.400 --> 01:10:10.400]   they're putting shoes on, they've got the right attire on,
[01:10:10.400 --> 01:10:12.400]   so I don't have to ask them,
[01:10:12.400 --> 01:10:14.400]   are you going hiking
[01:10:14.400 --> 01:10:16.400]   or are you going, you know?
[01:10:16.400 --> 01:10:18.400]   Because I know based upon how you dress.
[01:10:18.400 --> 01:10:20.400]   So
[01:10:20.400 --> 01:10:22.400]   the question is,
[01:10:22.400 --> 01:10:24.400]   spiritually, do you have
[01:10:24.400 --> 01:10:26.400]   slippers on?
[01:10:26.400 --> 01:10:28.400]   Or do you have the gospel
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:30.400]   of peace foot
[01:10:30.400 --> 01:10:32.400]   gear on, ready?
[01:10:32.400 --> 01:10:34.400]   Are your
[01:10:34.400 --> 01:10:36.400]   loins
[01:10:36.400 --> 01:10:38.400]   girdled?
[01:10:38.400 --> 01:10:40.400]   Do you have pants on?
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:42.400]   Or is it skinny jeans?
[01:10:42.400 --> 01:10:44.400]   Which is it, right?
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:46.400]   What do you have on?
[01:10:46.400 --> 01:10:48.400]   In your mindset,
[01:10:48.400 --> 01:10:50.400]   before we talk about anything specific,
[01:10:50.400 --> 01:10:52.400]   your mindset,
[01:10:52.400 --> 01:10:54.400]   are you aware?
[01:10:54.400 --> 01:10:56.400]   Are you aware of the spiritual battle?
[01:10:56.400 --> 01:10:58.400]   Are you aware of your enemy?
[01:10:58.400 --> 01:11:00.400]   Are you aware of the constant
[01:11:00.400 --> 01:11:02.400]   scheming to thwart you
[01:11:02.400 --> 01:11:04.400]   and to distract you and fill you
[01:11:04.400 --> 01:11:06.400]   with pride and tempt you? Are you aware
[01:11:06.400 --> 01:11:08.400]   of that?
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.400]   That causes us to be sober
[01:11:10.400 --> 01:11:12.400]   and to cling to him?
[01:11:12.400 --> 01:11:14.400]   If you do
[01:11:14.400 --> 01:11:16.400]   not pray in the spirit, your spiritual
[01:11:16.400 --> 01:11:18.400]   life is just a theory.
[01:11:18.400 --> 01:11:20.400]   It's just a theory.
[01:11:20.400 --> 01:11:22.400]   Just like it says in 2 Timothy
[01:11:22.400 --> 01:11:24.400]   3,
[01:11:24.400 --> 01:11:26.400]   it says in verse 5,
[01:11:26.400 --> 01:11:28.400]   "Holding on to a form of godliness, although they
[01:11:28.400 --> 01:11:30.400]   have denied its power,"
[01:11:30.400 --> 01:11:32.400]   and it says to avoid such men.
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.400]   A form of godliness,
[01:11:34.400 --> 01:11:36.400]   people who only know God in theory.
[01:11:36.400 --> 01:11:38.400]   Somebody talk about the
[01:11:38.400 --> 01:11:40.400]   love of God? It's just theoretical.
[01:11:40.400 --> 01:11:42.400]   It's not real.
[01:11:42.400 --> 01:11:44.400]   That's what happens.
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:46.400]   Prayer is what causes
[01:11:46.400 --> 01:11:48.400]   God to be real.
[01:11:48.400 --> 01:11:50.400]   Because you're talking to him.
[01:11:50.400 --> 01:11:52.400]   If all you've
[01:11:52.400 --> 01:11:54.400]   done is learn about
[01:11:54.400 --> 01:11:56.400]   him from a book,
[01:11:56.400 --> 01:11:58.400]   that's no different than learning about
[01:11:58.400 --> 01:12:00.400]   famous people from a book, from watching a movie.
[01:12:00.400 --> 01:12:02.400]   It says, "I know them because I watched a movie.
[01:12:02.400 --> 01:12:04.400]   I know them because I saw the interview."
[01:12:04.400 --> 01:12:06.400]   But you don't know them.
[01:12:06.400 --> 01:12:08.400]   The people who talk to them
[01:12:08.400 --> 01:12:10.400]   know them. The people who wrote
[01:12:10.400 --> 01:12:12.400]   the books know them.
[01:12:12.400 --> 01:12:14.400]   People have gone to him, interacted with him,
[01:12:14.400 --> 01:12:16.400]   and seen his power.
[01:12:16.400 --> 01:12:18.400]   They know them, but you don't know them.
[01:12:18.400 --> 01:12:20.400]   You know about them.
[01:12:20.400 --> 01:12:22.400]   And in the same way, when we don't pray,
[01:12:22.400 --> 01:12:24.400]   everything we know about God
[01:12:24.400 --> 01:12:26.400]   is just theory.
[01:12:26.400 --> 01:12:28.400]   And you guys already know,
[01:12:28.400 --> 01:12:30.400]   if anything that you learn remains
[01:12:30.400 --> 01:12:32.400]   a theory, eventually you're going to
[01:12:32.400 --> 01:12:34.400]   lose it.
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:36.400]   You're going to lose it.
[01:12:36.400 --> 01:12:38.400]   Some of you guys were
[01:12:38.400 --> 01:12:40.400]   studied one major, but if you
[01:12:40.400 --> 01:12:42.400]   don't use that, in about five years
[01:12:42.400 --> 01:12:44.400]   you're not going to remember, because
[01:12:44.400 --> 01:12:46.400]   you just learned theory.
[01:12:46.400 --> 01:12:48.400]   Only the things that
[01:12:48.400 --> 01:12:50.400]   you are practicing, you're going to get better at.
[01:12:50.400 --> 01:12:52.400]   So if the greatest
[01:12:52.400 --> 01:12:54.400]   commandment is, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[01:12:54.400 --> 01:12:56.400]   soul, mind, and strength,"
[01:12:56.400 --> 01:12:58.400]   and your relationship with God is just
[01:12:58.400 --> 01:13:00.400]   theoretical, it's just theory that you're hearing,
[01:13:00.400 --> 01:13:02.400]   regurgitating, studying,
[01:13:02.400 --> 01:13:04.400]   maybe even memorizing,
[01:13:04.400 --> 01:13:06.400]   your affection for God
[01:13:06.400 --> 01:13:08.400]   never grows. In fact, it actually
[01:13:08.400 --> 01:13:10.400]   decreases.
[01:13:10.400 --> 01:13:12.400]   But when you pray
[01:13:12.400 --> 01:13:14.400]   in the Spirit,
[01:13:14.400 --> 01:13:16.400]   when you feel the breath
[01:13:16.400 --> 01:13:18.400]   of God,
[01:13:18.400 --> 01:13:20.400]   when God answers your prayer,
[01:13:20.400 --> 01:13:22.400]   when you're praying for the lost,
[01:13:22.400 --> 01:13:24.400]   and He begins to show
[01:13:24.400 --> 01:13:26.400]   you His own heart, how broken
[01:13:26.400 --> 01:13:28.400]   He is for the lost, and you
[01:13:28.400 --> 01:13:30.400]   begin to sense His broken heart
[01:13:30.400 --> 01:13:32.400]   for the lost, and when God begins
[01:13:32.400 --> 01:13:34.400]   to answer your prayers,
[01:13:34.400 --> 01:13:36.400]   and God starts to become real to you,
[01:13:36.400 --> 01:13:38.400]   everything that you
[01:13:38.400 --> 01:13:40.400]   see what Apostle Paul is doing,
[01:13:40.400 --> 01:13:42.400]   you will understand why he did it.
[01:13:42.400 --> 01:13:44.400]   Maybe not to the degree
[01:13:44.400 --> 01:13:46.400]   that he understood it, but you
[01:13:46.400 --> 01:13:48.400]   will begin to understand every part of the
[01:13:48.400 --> 01:13:50.400]   Scripture, not theoretically,
[01:13:50.400 --> 01:13:52.400]   but you'll understand why he said it, why he's
[01:13:52.400 --> 01:13:54.400]   sitting in prison and worried for them.
[01:13:54.400 --> 01:13:56.400]   Why he's about to
[01:13:56.400 --> 01:13:58.400]   get his head beheaded, and he says, "I have fought a good
[01:13:58.400 --> 01:14:00.400]   fight. I'm ready."
[01:14:00.400 --> 01:14:02.400]   Why Apostle Paul is writing and saying,
[01:14:02.400 --> 01:14:04.400]   "If you were to ask me, I'm ready.
[01:14:04.400 --> 01:14:06.400]   I'd prefer dying than going to the
[01:14:06.400 --> 01:14:08.400]   Lord, but I know
[01:14:08.400 --> 01:14:10.400]   it's more beneficial for you, so I'll stay and bear
[01:14:10.400 --> 01:14:12.400]   more for you." You'll understand that
[01:14:12.400 --> 01:14:14.400]   when you understand
[01:14:14.400 --> 01:14:16.400]   the breath of God in you.
[01:14:16.400 --> 01:14:18.400]   That's why he says to pray.
[01:14:18.400 --> 01:14:20.400]   Pray, pray, pray,
[01:14:20.400 --> 01:14:22.400]   pray. So as
[01:14:22.400 --> 01:14:24.400]   we face 2024,
[01:14:24.400 --> 01:14:26.400]   our church has a reputation
[01:14:26.400 --> 01:14:28.400]   of being a Bible-centered church,
[01:14:28.400 --> 01:14:30.400]   but it
[01:14:30.400 --> 01:14:32.400]   is equally important
[01:14:32.400 --> 01:14:34.400]   that we need to be people who pray.
[01:14:34.400 --> 01:14:36.400]   Equally
[01:14:36.400 --> 01:14:38.400]   important. It's not number one and number
[01:14:38.400 --> 01:14:40.400]   two. It's call number one.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:42.400]   When the Apostles
[01:14:42.400 --> 01:14:44.400]   established the seven deacons, he said,
[01:14:44.400 --> 01:14:46.400]   "So that we can devote ourselves to
[01:14:46.400 --> 01:14:48.400]   word and prayer."
[01:14:48.400 --> 01:14:50.400]   All of us, not just
[01:14:50.400 --> 01:14:52.400]   the Apostles, not just the pastors, all of
[01:14:52.400 --> 01:14:54.400]   us, that we need to be equally committed
[01:14:54.400 --> 01:14:56.400]   to the word and to prayer.
[01:14:56.400 --> 01:14:58.400]   That's why, even if it's for the next
[01:14:58.400 --> 01:15:00.400]   10 or 20 years that this is going to be
[01:15:00.400 --> 01:15:02.400]   our theme, and we move
[01:15:02.400 --> 01:15:04.400]   only inches,
[01:15:04.400 --> 01:15:06.400]   as long as it is in the right direction,
[01:15:06.400 --> 01:15:08.400]   we're going to keep emphasizing this, because
[01:15:08.400 --> 01:15:10.400]   this is that important.
[01:15:10.400 --> 01:15:12.400]   We need to be a church that
[01:15:12.400 --> 01:15:14.400]   prays. That the
[01:15:14.400 --> 01:15:16.400]   fruit that we bear is because
[01:15:16.400 --> 01:15:18.400]   the Holy Spirit
[01:15:18.400 --> 01:15:20.400]   is answering our prayers.
[01:15:20.400 --> 01:15:22.400]   I pray at
[01:15:22.400 --> 01:15:24.400]   the minimum, right? I'm going to
[01:15:24.400 --> 01:15:26.400]   be preaching about what it means to pray in the
[01:15:26.400 --> 01:15:28.400]   Holy Spirit. So today was part one, next week
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:30.400]   will be part two, next third week will be part
[01:15:30.400 --> 01:15:32.400]   three, and that will prepare our team to
[01:15:32.400 --> 01:15:34.400]   go out to India.
[01:15:34.400 --> 01:15:36.400]   At least,
[01:15:36.400 --> 01:15:38.400]   even if you struggle for the rest of the
[01:15:38.400 --> 01:15:40.400]   year, that at the least, in
[01:15:40.400 --> 01:15:42.400]   your psyche, in your
[01:15:42.400 --> 01:15:44.400]   memory, that you understand
[01:15:44.400 --> 01:15:46.400]   just how critical
[01:15:46.400 --> 01:15:48.400]   this is.
[01:15:48.400 --> 01:15:50.400]   That we devote ourselves to prayer
[01:15:50.400 --> 01:15:52.400]   in 2024.
[01:15:52.400 --> 01:15:54.400]   Let's pray.
[01:15:54.400 --> 01:15:56.400]   (Silence)
[01:15:56.400 --> 01:15:58.400]   (Silence)
[01:15:58.400 --> 01:16:00.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:00.400 --> 01:16:02.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:02.400 --> 01:16:04.400]   Father,
[01:16:04.400 --> 01:16:06.400]   as you
[01:16:06.400 --> 01:16:08.400]   continue to show kindness to us,
[01:16:08.400 --> 01:16:10.400]   as you continue
[01:16:10.400 --> 01:16:12.400]   to show patience and mercy,
[01:16:12.400 --> 01:16:14.400]   Lord,
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:16.400]   teach us, guide us, and lead us
[01:16:16.400 --> 01:16:18.400]   to pray.
[01:16:18.400 --> 01:16:20.400]   To pray effectively.
[01:16:20.400 --> 01:16:22.400]   To pray for all things.
[01:16:22.400 --> 01:16:24.400]   To pray unceasingly.
[01:16:24.400 --> 01:16:26.400]   But ultimately,
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:28.400]   to pray in the Spirit.
[01:16:28.400 --> 01:16:30.400]   Help
[01:16:30.400 --> 01:16:32.400]   us, Lord God, that 2024,
[01:16:32.400 --> 01:16:34.400]   that you
[01:16:34.400 --> 01:16:36.400]   would move us, guide us, sanctify us,
[01:16:36.400 --> 01:16:38.400]   that we would truly
[01:16:38.400 --> 01:16:40.400]   be a house of prayer.
[01:16:40.400 --> 01:16:42.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:16:42.400 --> 01:16:44.400]   Let's all stand up for the closing
[01:16:44.400 --> 01:16:46.400]   praise.
[01:16:46.400 --> 01:16:48.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:48.400 --> 01:16:50.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:50.400 --> 01:16:52.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:52.400 --> 01:16:54.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:54.400 --> 01:16:56.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:56.400 --> 01:16:58.400]   (Silence)
[01:16:58.400 --> 01:17:00.400]   (Silence)
[01:17:00.400 --> 01:17:02.400]   (Silence)
[01:17:02.400 --> 01:17:04.400]   As we seek, as we
