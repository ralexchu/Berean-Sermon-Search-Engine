[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.760]   Romans chapter 11 and let me read from verse just to understand the context I'm going to
[00:00:10.760 --> 00:00:15.960]   read it from all the way from 13 through 24 but our focus will be this morning on verse
[00:00:15.960 --> 00:00:19.080]   16 through 20, 21.
[00:00:19.080 --> 00:00:21.560]   Romans chapter 11 verse 13 and on.
[00:00:21.560 --> 00:00:26.860]   Now I am speaking to you Gentiles and as much as I am an apostle to the Gentiles, I magnify
[00:00:26.860 --> 00:00:31.160]   my ministry in order that somehow to make my fellow Jews jealous and thus save some
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:32.160]   of them.
[00:00:32.160 --> 00:00:36.080]   For if their rejection means the reconciliation of the world, what will their acceptance mean
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:38.920]   but life from the dead?
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.640]   If the dough offered as first fruit is holy, so is the whole lump and if the root is holy,
[00:00:42.640 --> 00:00:44.200]   so are the branches.
[00:00:44.200 --> 00:00:47.680]   But if some of the branches were broken off and you, although a wild olive shoot, were
[00:00:47.680 --> 00:00:52.680]   grafted in among the others, now share in the nourishing fruit of the olive tree.
[00:00:52.680 --> 00:00:54.280]   Do not be arrogant toward the branches.
[00:00:54.280 --> 00:01:00.080]   If you are, remember it is not you who support the root but the root that supports you.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.280]   Then you will say branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:04.280]   That is true.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.380]   They were broken off because of their unbelief but you stand fast through faith.
[00:01:08.380 --> 00:01:10.660]   So do not become proud but fear.
[00:01:10.660 --> 00:01:14.560]   For if God did not spare the natural branches, neither will he spare you.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.400]   Note then the kindness and the severity of God, severity toward those who have fallen
[00:01:18.400 --> 00:01:22.040]   but God's kindness to you provided you continue in kindness.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:26.280]   Otherwise you too will be cut off and even they, if they do not continue in their unbelief,
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.300]   will be grafted in for God has the power to graft them in again.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:34.880]   For if you were cut off from what is by nature a wild olive tree and grafted contrary to
[00:01:34.880 --> 00:01:39.600]   nature into a cultivated olive tree, how much more will these, the natural branches, be
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:45.000]   grafted back into their own olive tree?
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:58.320]   Heavenly loving Father, we have gathered here to worship you, to take time to allow
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:02.400]   your word to judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:09.080]   I pray, Father, that nothing would be added or taken away and that we would be able to
[00:02:09.080 --> 00:02:12.200]   hear your voice and your voice alone.
[00:02:12.200 --> 00:02:15.080]   We ask, Lord God, that you would anoint this time as we have come to worship you.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:19.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:19.400 --> 00:02:23.440]   As we've been studying the book of Romans, again, we're in a section of the Bible where
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:29.560]   the place of Israel in God's redemptive history and so he's been spending most of really the
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:33.960]   book of Romans talking about this subject but intensified starting from chapter 9 through
[00:02:33.960 --> 00:02:34.960]   11.
[00:02:34.960 --> 00:02:38.880]   And again, when we get to chapter 12, he's going to change gears a little bit and say,
[00:02:38.880 --> 00:02:42.520]   "Therefore, considering this great mercy that God has shown us, this is how you ought to
[00:02:42.520 --> 00:02:44.160]   live."
[00:02:44.160 --> 00:02:48.760]   Chapter 11, we've been talking about Paul has been emphasizing the place of Israel and
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:49.760]   what God has been doing.
[00:02:49.760 --> 00:02:55.520]   And if there's one thing that keeps jumping out over and over and over again is God's
[00:02:55.520 --> 00:02:59.840]   continued patience and love for the nation of Israel.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:04.320]   That despite everything that Israel has done up to this point, and we're not talking about
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.400]   a few years and we're not talking about one generation, but we're talking about generation
[00:03:08.400 --> 00:03:12.640]   after generation, dozens and dozens of generations.
[00:03:12.640 --> 00:03:17.960]   And it is natural that we would ask this question if salvation is by grace alone.
[00:03:17.960 --> 00:03:23.360]   And it wasn't what the Jews thought it was, then is God done with Israel?
[00:03:23.360 --> 00:03:27.440]   Not only is God done, would we think that God is done with Israel because what they
[00:03:27.440 --> 00:03:32.720]   were thinking about how they were going to bring glory to God and what actually happened
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.180]   is completely off, but even the way that they thought that they were going to be drawn near
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.000]   to God was completely off, then what's the purpose of Israel?
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   So that's the question that God has been asking over and over again.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.040]   But if there's one thing that keeps popping out over is the depth of the love of God toward
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:52.280]   his people.
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:56.280]   And I know we talk about the agape love and it's unconditional and how we ought to share
[00:03:56.280 --> 00:03:59.040]   this unconditional love with one another.
[00:03:59.040 --> 00:04:04.160]   But we have to honestly admit when we take a close look at the love that God shares with
[00:04:04.160 --> 00:04:09.880]   his people, that is unlike anything else that you guys, you and I know.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.240]   You know, we could say it's like the love of a mother, it's the love of a father, but
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:18.600]   we have to admit the more we dig into that, that this is strange love.
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:26.240]   A love that would cause him to sacrifice his son for unbelieving and blasphemous sinners.
[00:04:26.240 --> 00:04:29.400]   That is not a love that you and I know from our parents.
[00:04:29.400 --> 00:04:34.280]   It may be closer, may be purer than any other love that we know, but it is not the same
[00:04:34.280 --> 00:04:36.480]   kind of love that we see in Scripture.
[00:04:36.480 --> 00:04:40.680]   In fact, if you can turn your Bibles to Hosea chapter 11, actually the passage is going
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:43.880]   to be up behind me.
[00:04:43.880 --> 00:04:48.920]   The background behind Hosea is about, Hosea is prophesying that the nation of Israel is
[00:04:48.920 --> 00:04:53.480]   going to captivity because God, he lays out the history of God's love toward the nation
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.480]   of Israel.
[00:04:54.480 --> 00:05:00.440]   So some of you guys who know this, the prophet and the content of this prophet, basically
[00:05:00.440 --> 00:05:06.560]   God tells Hosea to go love Gomer who was a prostitute and as he keeps loving her, she
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:10.240]   would keep prostituting herself and then when he would return, he would say, "No, go after
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   her again."
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:17.480]   And over and over again, God tells Hosea to go love this adulterous woman.
[00:05:17.480 --> 00:05:22.960]   And he illustrates that, says that this is my relationship with the nation of Israel.
[00:05:22.960 --> 00:05:30.280]   That despite my constant love of pursuing you, you continue to go after to other nations
[00:05:30.280 --> 00:05:31.900]   and idols.
[00:05:31.900 --> 00:05:37.600]   And so it says, therefore, as a result of this, that they're going to go into captivity.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:42.200]   But even in the context of God bringing judgment upon the nation of Israel, you can see the
[00:05:42.200 --> 00:05:43.560]   heart of God.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:48.640]   In Hosea chapter 11, verses 1, it says, "When Israel was a child, I loved him and out of
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:50.000]   Egypt I called my son.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.440]   The more they were called, the more they went away.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:57.640]   They kept sacrificing to balls and burning offerings to idols.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:05:59.960]   Yet it was I who taught Ephraim to walk.
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:04.280]   I took them up by their arms, but they did not know that I healed them.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:09.520]   I led them with cords of kindness, with the bands of love, and I became to them as one
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:11.600]   who eases the yoke on their jaws.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:14.320]   And I bent down to them and fed them."
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:16.040]   We jump to verse 9 through 11.
[00:06:16.040 --> 00:06:19.400]   It says, "I will not execute my burning anger.
[00:06:19.400 --> 00:06:23.200]   I will not again destroy Ephraim, for I am God and not a man.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:27.360]   The Holy One in your midst, and I will not come in wrath.
[00:06:27.360 --> 00:06:28.820]   They shall go after the Lord.
[00:06:28.820 --> 00:06:30.160]   He will roar like a lion.
[00:06:30.160 --> 00:06:33.800]   When he roars, his children shall come trembling from the west.
[00:06:33.800 --> 00:06:38.900]   They shall come trembling like birds from Egypt and like doves from the land of Assyria.
[00:06:38.900 --> 00:06:42.640]   And I will return them to their homes, declares the Lord."
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.100]   So even as he is declaring judgment upon the nation of Israel, you can see the tender heart
[00:06:48.100 --> 00:06:50.560]   of God toward this nation.
[00:06:50.560 --> 00:06:55.840]   And he prophesies, even though you will go away for now, there will come a time when
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:00.280]   his anger will no longer burn and he will bring them back.
[00:07:00.280 --> 00:07:05.560]   Even in chapter 14, verse 4 through 7, he concludes this judgment against Israel in
[00:07:05.560 --> 00:07:06.560]   verse 4 through 7.
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.160]   It says, "I will heal their apostasy.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:13.280]   I will love them freely, for my anger has turned from them.
[00:07:13.280 --> 00:07:15.680]   I will be like the dew to Israel.
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:17.700]   He shall blossom like the lily.
[00:07:17.700 --> 00:07:20.440]   He shall take root like the trees of Lebanon.
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:21.680]   His shoot shall spread out.
[00:07:21.680 --> 00:07:25.000]   His beauty shall be like olive and his fragrance like Lebanon.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.440]   They shall return and dwell beneath my shadow.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:29.280]   They shall flourish like the grain.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:31.280]   They shall blossom like the vine.
[00:07:31.280 --> 00:07:34.360]   Their fame shall be like the wine of Lebanon."
[00:07:34.360 --> 00:07:42.920]   Again, we see in this context, and again, I just chose Hosea, but if you read the prophets,
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:46.680]   every single one of these prophets, there's an element of God's anger and judgment where
[00:07:46.680 --> 00:07:50.700]   Israel has pushed God to the breaking point.
[00:07:50.700 --> 00:07:53.640]   And so finally, for their own sake, God's bring judgment upon them.
[00:07:53.640 --> 00:08:00.480]   But even in the midst of judgment, you see God's tender love for his nation.
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:08.800]   There's nothing that you and I know that comes anywhere close to his patience, to his forgiveness,
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:15.280]   to his unconditional love against the people who keep rebelling over and over and over
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:17.600]   again.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:23.720]   Apostle Paul has said in the book of Romans that if it was up to him, if it was possible,
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:27.600]   he said, "I would rather be accursed than my countrymen."
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:30.680]   He himself expresses, "I'm a Jew.
[00:08:30.680 --> 00:08:32.120]   That is not my desire for my people.
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.960]   I'm not saying all these things because I hate my nation."
[00:08:35.960 --> 00:08:39.080]   But Paul is not simply saying that because he's a nationalist.
[00:08:39.080 --> 00:08:42.120]   He just grew up and he just loves his country.
[00:08:42.120 --> 00:08:48.240]   You have to remember, his countrymen almost wholeheartedly rejected Paul.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:51.680]   Paul was the golden child in Israel.
[00:08:51.680 --> 00:08:54.600]   He was on a fast track to become the leader among leaders.
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.880]   He may have been sitting on the Sanhedrin already.
[00:08:56.880 --> 00:09:03.600]   He comes from a royal, not royal, but I mean, you could say as royal as we could, he'd come
[00:09:03.600 --> 00:09:08.960]   from a very high pedigree where he has Roman citizenship, he has money, he has education,
[00:09:08.960 --> 00:09:12.280]   he is perfect by his own description when it comes to the law.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:17.480]   So in every aspect, if you were to pick the Jew among Jews, it would have been Apostle
[00:09:17.480 --> 00:09:18.480]   Paul.
[00:09:18.480 --> 00:09:25.320]   Yet, when he turned and he began to preach the gospel and he began to exalt Christ, his
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:29.080]   countrymen completely wholeheartedly reject him.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:32.120]   Paul says this in the first Thessalonians 2, 4, and he says, "But just as we have been
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:36.440]   approved by God to be entrusted with the gospel, so we speak not to please man, but to please
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.000]   God who tests our hearts."
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.220]   He says again in 2 Corinthians 11, 24, describing his ministry on frequent journeys in danger
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:51.440]   from rivers, danger from robbers, danger from my own people, and even danger among Gentiles,
[00:09:51.440 --> 00:09:53.000]   and he goes on and on.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:58.720]   And one of the dangers that he describes is coming from his own nation.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:05.720]   He would go to the synagogues and first preach the gospel to his countrymen.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.000]   And everywhere he went, he would get kicked out and get rejected, and that's why he ends
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.160]   up going to the Gentiles.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.480]   He was rejected by the Sanhedrin, he was rejected by the leaders, he was rejected every city
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.340]   that he went to.
[00:10:17.340 --> 00:10:21.320]   In every way, his countrymen basically stopped him.
[00:10:21.320 --> 00:10:23.760]   It was the Jews who stoned him initially.
[00:10:23.760 --> 00:10:31.380]   It was the Jews who beat him and took him to jail and hopefully trying to kill him.
[00:10:31.380 --> 00:10:34.640]   It wasn't simply nationalism.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:40.360]   Paul's love for the Jewish people was simply a reflection of God's love for them.
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:45.400]   As an apostle of Jesus Christ, it's not up to him to decide who's going to love, who's
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:47.000]   not going to love.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.400]   He's just to convey the message and the heart of the person that he's representing.
[00:10:52.400 --> 00:11:00.200]   And so Paul's longing for his people is simply a reflection of the Father for his people.
[00:11:00.200 --> 00:11:02.560]   And we can clearly see that.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.400]   And that's what Paul has been saying, that though they have experienced a temporary hardening
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.240]   of the heart, it is not permanent.
[00:11:10.240 --> 00:11:15.080]   And so within that larger context of work, in verse 16, I want to read that passage again.
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.440]   Paul says, "If the dough offered as first fruit is holy, so is the whole lump and the
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:23.680]   root is holy, and so are the branches."
[00:11:23.680 --> 00:11:29.960]   So let's examine this and what does he mean by this and what's Paul's main point.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:34.000]   When he describes holiness, typically when we think of holiness, we think of somebody
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.880]   morally upright, right?
[00:11:36.880 --> 00:11:42.440]   So let me ask you, can somebody who's not a Christian be holy?
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   Don't say it.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:45.360]   I just wanted you to think of it for a little bit.
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:47.960]   Can somebody who's not a Christian be holy?
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:52.320]   So typically in our world, we'll say, you know, here's a Buddhist monk.
[00:11:52.320 --> 00:11:53.960]   He's a holy man.
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:12:00.200]   Or a, you know, or a leader in another religious sect, they would say, "Anybody who's man of
[00:12:00.200 --> 00:12:01.560]   the cloth is a holy man."
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:07.720]   So a priest, a pastor, or a monk, or whatever it may be, anybody who's dedicated, morally
[00:12:07.720 --> 00:12:09.620]   upright, they're holy.
[00:12:09.620 --> 00:12:15.720]   But according to biblical standards, can a man who's just morally upright be considered
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:17.240]   holy?
[00:12:17.240 --> 00:12:19.560]   No.
[00:12:19.560 --> 00:12:23.880]   And the reason why is because according to biblical standard, holiness is not just meeting
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:27.000]   the standard of what we have set in our generation.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.200]   Holiness basically is related to obedience.
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:35.000]   So what is upright is directly linked to obedience to God's Word.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:37.600]   So that's the first understanding of holiness.
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:43.120]   But in here, when Paul says the first, the dough is holy because the first fruit is holy,
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:47.920]   the dough clearly is talking about the nation of Israel.
[00:12:47.920 --> 00:12:53.760]   So is he saying, when he's saying that the dough is holy, is he saying that the dough
[00:12:53.760 --> 00:12:58.280]   is holy because it is morally upright?
[00:12:58.280 --> 00:12:59.280]   Don't say anything.
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:01.840]   Just think about it for a minute.
[00:13:01.840 --> 00:13:03.160]   Clearly that's not what he is saying.
[00:13:03.160 --> 00:13:07.080]   He's not saying that dough is holy because it kept the commandments and it was obeyed,
[00:13:07.080 --> 00:13:10.720]   and then the first fruit that they gave, they were also holy because they kept the commandments.
[00:13:10.720 --> 00:13:12.740]   Clearly that's not what he is in reference to.
[00:13:12.740 --> 00:13:18.580]   But there's a second meaning, a biblical meaning of holiness that's better applied here.
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:23.160]   And that second meaning is whatever is set apart, and the word holy basically literally
[00:13:23.160 --> 00:13:24.900]   means to be set apart.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:31.360]   Whatever is set apart for God's possession or God's use became holy.
[00:13:31.360 --> 00:13:35.420]   So when they set up the tabernacle, they would set up the tent and the poles and different
[00:13:35.420 --> 00:13:39.860]   articles that they would use, and though it may have been made for common use, once it
[00:13:39.860 --> 00:13:43.540]   was dedicated for God's use, it became holy.
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:48.940]   And once it became holy, God would have specific prescriptions of how to handle it.
[00:13:48.940 --> 00:13:52.900]   So just as you would come into the temple, if you were to handle the cup that is dedicated
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:55.060]   to the temple, you'd have to be cleansed.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:14:00.180]   You would have an animal that may have been yours and you were raising it, but once it
[00:14:00.180 --> 00:14:05.300]   was dedicated for the purpose of sacrifice, the animal itself became holy.
[00:14:05.300 --> 00:14:10.980]   So it didn't become holy because it met certain standards and lived in obedience and was morally
[00:14:10.980 --> 00:14:11.980]   upright.
[00:14:11.980 --> 00:14:16.100]   It became holy simply because it was dedicated to the Lord.
[00:14:16.100 --> 00:14:21.700]   So whatever belonged to God and whatever God chooses to use becomes holy.
[00:14:21.700 --> 00:14:27.580]   So he's using that analogy as you know, the concept of tithing comes from what he's talking
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:30.340]   about here, giving the first.
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:35.860]   Tithing was commanded in the Old Testament to signify that this first fruit that we give
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:39.800]   to God symbolizes that all of it belongs to God.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:43.920]   So the first fruit that we give, the tithing that we give, is not just about the tent,
[00:14:43.920 --> 00:14:46.860]   but is a dedication of everything that we own.
[00:14:46.860 --> 00:14:52.380]   So the first act of lordship in the Old Testament was to dedicate our tithe, again, symbolizing
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.220]   that not only the harvest, but everything that I own is yours.
[00:14:55.220 --> 00:15:02.700]   So he's using that analogy to say that Israel is holy because the first fruits of Israel
[00:15:02.700 --> 00:15:07.220]   were dedicated to be holy, to be his.
[00:15:07.220 --> 00:15:08.380]   So what is the first fruit?
[00:15:08.380 --> 00:15:13.940]   If the dough is Israel, then what is the first fruit that was dedicated that made the rest
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:17.140]   of Israel holy?
[00:15:17.140 --> 00:15:19.580]   Just think, right?
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.260]   What is the first fruit of Israel?
[00:15:25.260 --> 00:15:30.860]   There are three people that are always mentioned in Israel's history and reminds them that
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:35.820]   I am the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:15:35.820 --> 00:15:37.540]   Now why do they do that?
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:41.700]   Why does even hundreds of years later they say, "I'm going to do this because I am the
[00:15:41.700 --> 00:15:45.260]   God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob."
[00:15:45.260 --> 00:15:50.140]   Because Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were the first fruits that God dedicated and made a
[00:15:50.140 --> 00:15:51.140]   covenant with.
[00:15:51.140 --> 00:15:56.020]   He made a unilateral covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, saying that I'm going to
[00:15:56.020 --> 00:16:01.340]   possess you and I'm going to use you for his glory.
[00:16:01.340 --> 00:16:07.040]   And so when he says that the whole dough became holy because the first fruits were holy, he's
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:12.540]   referring to the very beginning covenant that he made with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:17.900]   That's why over and over again in Israel's history, even as they are being unfaithful,
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:23.820]   God says, "I will keep my covenant for my name's sake, for I am the God of Abraham,
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:24.820]   Isaac, and Jacob."
[00:16:24.820 --> 00:16:28.900]   So he's always going back to the first fruit and saying, "I'm going to be faithful to that."
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:33.860]   Genesis 50, 24, "And Joseph said to his brothers, 'I am about to die, but God will visit you
[00:16:33.860 --> 00:16:39.100]   and bring you up out of this land to the land that he swore to Abraham, to Isaac, and to
[00:16:39.100 --> 00:16:40.860]   Jacob.'"
[00:16:40.860 --> 00:16:45.980]   So Joseph's confidence that God was going to be faithful to the nation of Israel goes
[00:16:45.980 --> 00:16:50.260]   back to the promise, the covenant that God makes with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:54.660]   Exodus chapter 2, 24, "And God heard their groaning, and God remembered His covenant
[00:16:54.660 --> 00:16:56.660]   with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob."
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:17:02.660]   So the beginning of the nation of Israel, as they are in captivity, God is faithful
[00:17:02.660 --> 00:17:06.660]   and He begins His journey to establish the nation of Israel because of His covenant of
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:11.100]   His first fruit with Abraham, with Isaac, and with Jacob.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:15.500]   So the point that Paul is trying to make with the nation of Israel and what he was trying
[00:17:15.500 --> 00:17:23.060]   to get us to understand is that Israel is holy not because they were morally upright
[00:17:23.060 --> 00:17:25.180]   as a whole.
[00:17:25.180 --> 00:17:28.020]   Israel is holy because the first fruits were dedicated.
[00:17:28.020 --> 00:17:30.420]   Who dedicated them?
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.260]   God did.
[00:17:32.260 --> 00:17:36.000]   God dedicated the nation of Israel for Himself.
[00:17:36.000 --> 00:17:39.220]   So the question that he's answering is, God did not forsake them.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.220]   He's not done.
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.620]   Did they fall so they would not return?
[00:17:41.620 --> 00:17:43.860]   He said, "By no means."
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:47.280]   Because God dedicated these people to Himself.
[00:17:47.280 --> 00:17:53.420]   That though partially they have experienced a hardening of their heart, the nation itself
[00:17:53.420 --> 00:17:55.780]   is still His.
[00:17:55.780 --> 00:17:58.700]   It's still His and they are still holy.
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:02.780]   Now how does that, what does that mean to us?
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.580]   Well that's exactly what it says in Ephesians chapter 5, 25-27.
[00:18:06.580 --> 00:18:12.180]   That's a passage we typically read and study whenever we talk about the marriage, the husband
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:16.540]   ought to love their wives unconditionally and wives to the husband to submit as church
[00:18:16.540 --> 00:18:17.620]   does to Christ.
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:19.540]   But Paul makes it very clear.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:24.140]   He's using the illustration of marriage to talk about Christ in the church, not the other
[00:18:24.140 --> 00:18:25.140]   way.
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:30.740]   Typically we hear it the other way where this is the marriage is like love between Christ
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:36.380]   and His church but at the end of this passage it says no, he's trying to highlight through
[00:18:36.380 --> 00:18:41.420]   the marriage relationship, the relationship between Christ and His church.
[00:18:41.420 --> 00:18:42.980]   And look what he says here.
[00:18:42.980 --> 00:18:47.700]   Ephesians 5, 25-27, "Husbands, love your wives as Christ loved the church."
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.260]   And then he describes Christ's love to the church next.
[00:18:51.260 --> 00:18:57.860]   And he gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her.
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:04.380]   Usually in a marriage ceremony you'd have the bride coming down and she would wear white
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.780]   and it would signify virginity, her purity, right?
[00:19:10.780 --> 00:19:17.420]   But in a Christian marriage we understand that her dress of whiteness symbolizes the
[00:19:17.420 --> 00:19:21.520]   love of Christ, that she didn't earn that dress.
[00:19:21.520 --> 00:19:25.740]   She doesn't have that dress on because she was morally pure and perfect like the world
[00:19:25.740 --> 00:19:27.480]   may understand it.
[00:19:27.480 --> 00:19:31.900]   The Christian marriage ceremony we understand that despite that she didn't deserve it,
[00:19:31.900 --> 00:19:35.780]   Christ put that white dress on her and that's exactly what he says.
[00:19:35.780 --> 00:19:42.300]   Christ loved the church and gave himself up for her that he might sanctify her.
[00:19:42.300 --> 00:19:48.660]   What role does she play in her sanctification?
[00:19:48.660 --> 00:19:53.900]   According to this passage, what role did she play to wear that dress?
[00:19:53.900 --> 00:19:55.860]   Nothing.
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.900]   It says that he might sanctify her having cleansed her by the washing of water with
[00:20:01.900 --> 00:20:03.660]   the word.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:07.000]   What part did she play in her cleansing?
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:08.040]   What part did she play?
[00:20:08.040 --> 00:20:10.840]   What was the role did she play?
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:14.620]   She was a passive recipient of the love of Christ.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:19.700]   And so that he might present the church to himself in splendor without spot or wrinkle
[00:20:19.700 --> 00:20:24.340]   or any such thing that she might be holy and without blemish.
[00:20:24.340 --> 00:20:28.080]   So how did she become holy and without blemish?
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:33.740]   So when we talk about holiness, again there is an aspect of holiness.
[00:20:33.740 --> 00:20:38.600]   The Bible tells us to be holy for our heavenly father is holy and it's talking about morally
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:41.080]   being upright like the father is.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:46.500]   But when he is describing the nation of Israel, when he's describing church and his people,
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:55.280]   initially he says we are holy as the church is holy, as Christ made it holy.
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:20:58.900]   And they didn't play any part in this, in sanctification.
[00:20:58.900 --> 00:21:04.340]   So we became holy because God chose us, chose to love us.
[00:21:04.340 --> 00:21:09.820]   Now what is the significance of this in all that we're talking about?
[00:21:09.820 --> 00:21:14.620]   He's saying all of this because he's saying, well, the nation of Israel didn't live up
[00:21:14.620 --> 00:21:15.620]   to the calling.
[00:21:15.620 --> 00:21:17.220]   They didn't do what they were supposed to do.
[00:21:17.220 --> 00:21:18.860]   They were supposed to glorify God.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:22.740]   And in the very, very beginning of the book of Romans it says because of you the name
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.460]   of God is being blasphemed.
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.360]   So they didn't serve their purpose.
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:30.420]   They failed miserably over and over and over again.
[00:21:30.420 --> 00:21:35.980]   So then what use does God have with these failures?
[00:21:35.980 --> 00:21:39.300]   That's the question that Paul's answering here.
[00:21:39.300 --> 00:21:41.200]   They are not holy because they were perfect.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:47.680]   They were holy because it was first fruits were dedicated, because God made them holy.
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:51.160]   That though, and we're going to talk about the second part of this next week where he
[00:21:51.160 --> 00:21:55.080]   talks about the kindness and the severity of God, and we're going to talk more in detail
[00:21:55.080 --> 00:21:58.520]   about the application of this doctrine.
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:03.720]   But in essence what Paul is saying first and foremost, what we recognize is that holiness
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:06.200]   was given to them.
[00:22:06.200 --> 00:22:08.220]   It was given to them.
[00:22:08.220 --> 00:22:10.140]   God chose to give it to them.
[00:22:10.140 --> 00:22:11.260]   They didn't earn the love.
[00:22:11.260 --> 00:22:14.980]   The reason why they exist and the reason why they will continue to exist and the reason
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:21.120]   why he will remain faithful to them is because God chose that for them.
[00:22:21.120 --> 00:22:24.040]   It's just that for now they've received the hearting of the heart.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:27.540]   When the fullness of the Gentiles has come in, he said he's going to fulfill the prophecy
[00:22:27.540 --> 00:22:29.180]   that we just read in Hosea.
[00:22:29.180 --> 00:22:33.740]   He's going to bring them back.
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:36.700]   You and I did not earn this love.
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:41.540]   And I know this is Christianity 101.
[00:22:41.540 --> 00:22:48.740]   This is basics of Christianity, basics of justification by faith.
[00:22:48.740 --> 00:22:54.780]   It is easy to hear, but very difficult to apply.
[00:22:54.780 --> 00:23:03.720]   Because the immediate application of justification by faith is humility.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:08.360]   That's why he says in verse 18 and 20, he says, "Therefore," well, if they're holy because
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:12.400]   of the first fruit of holy, if the roots are holy and so we're grafted in and we're not
[00:23:12.400 --> 00:23:17.920]   the ones who support the roots, but root supports us, well, okay, we get that.
[00:23:17.920 --> 00:23:18.920]   So what?
[00:23:18.920 --> 00:23:19.920]   What does that mean?
[00:23:19.920 --> 00:23:25.100]   Well, he says in verse 18, "So therefore do not be arrogant toward the branches.
[00:23:25.100 --> 00:23:29.480]   If you remember, it is not you who support the root, but it is the root that supports
[00:23:29.480 --> 00:23:30.480]   you.
[00:23:30.480 --> 00:23:35.160]   And you will say the branches were broken off so that I might be grafted in.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:36.400]   That is true.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:41.160]   They were broken off because of their unbelief, but you stand fast through faith.
[00:23:41.160 --> 00:23:44.360]   So do not become proud, but fear."
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.200]   So he says this two times.
[00:23:46.200 --> 00:23:50.800]   "Therefore," the immediate application one, he said, "Do not be arrogant toward those
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:51.800]   Jews."
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:55.160]   We're going to talk about the second part of that application next week.
[00:23:55.160 --> 00:23:59.280]   But the first part he says, "Don't look at them because they failed and think somehow
[00:23:59.280 --> 00:24:04.160]   you're going to become proud and say, 'Well, we're right with God and you're not.'
[00:24:04.160 --> 00:24:06.880]   Do not forget that they're God's people."
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:09.760]   And then he's going to say, and we'll talk about more next week, "Do not forget that
[00:24:09.760 --> 00:24:12.520]   you are just as weak."
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:15.860]   But first thing he says is, "You did not support them.
[00:24:15.860 --> 00:24:19.240]   They supported you."
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:23.460]   In Ephesians 2, 12 through 13, Paul reminds them, "Remember that you are at that time
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.880]   separated from Christ, alienated from the commonwealth of Israel and the strangers to
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:32.360]   the covenant of the promise, having no hope and without God in the world.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:37.400]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who once were far off have been brought near by the blood
[00:24:37.400 --> 00:24:39.820]   of Christ."
[00:24:39.820 --> 00:24:40.920]   They support us.
[00:24:40.920 --> 00:24:41.920]   We do not support them.
[00:24:41.920 --> 00:24:45.720]   In other words, what Paul is saying, it is because of the Old Testament that we have
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:49.160]   the New Testament.
[00:24:49.160 --> 00:24:53.720]   I think that the mistake that we're making in our generation, at least where you and
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:58.760]   I live, that predominantly the Word of God is centered around the New Testament because
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:00.940]   it is clearer.
[00:25:00.940 --> 00:25:02.080]   Because the points are clear.
[00:25:02.080 --> 00:25:04.780]   Here's my point and here's my sub-points and here's my conclusion.
[00:25:04.780 --> 00:25:07.960]   So it's easier to preach and easier to summarize, easier to teach.
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:13.560]   And I remember years ago when I was, again, at Together for the Gospel and we'd say,
[00:25:13.560 --> 00:25:15.960]   "Oh, how many of you were preaching through the Old Testament?"
[00:25:15.960 --> 00:25:18.140]   And very few people were preaching through the Old Testament.
[00:25:18.140 --> 00:25:22.160]   And I remember some of you guys who were there, it was so hard preaching through the Old Testament
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:27.080]   because there's very little material for support.
[00:25:27.080 --> 00:25:28.080]   Very few commentaries.
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.280]   In fact, a few commentaries that they do recommend, it's in German.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:36.400]   So any of you who know anything about Old Testament scholarship, they're all German.
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:40.280]   So if you want to be an Old Testament scholar, first thing you need to do is to learn German,
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.080]   which I'm not going to do.
[00:25:43.080 --> 00:25:44.480]   So New Testament is easy.
[00:25:44.480 --> 00:25:48.600]   If I want to study Romans, I mean, I have to choose from hundreds of commentaries and
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:52.760]   out of that, I basically have about eight or nine different Roman commentaries and out
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:55.480]   of that, I have a few that I read on a regular basis.
[00:25:55.480 --> 00:25:56.800]   So it's easy.
[00:25:56.800 --> 00:26:00.320]   But in the Old Testament, I'll go to the book of Judges, there's almost no commentary.
[00:26:00.320 --> 00:26:04.160]   And I try to look for other pastors who preach through it and I see two sermons in 1 and
[00:26:04.160 --> 00:26:07.000]   2 Kings, the whole thing.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.160]   And I'm trying to go through it from chapter to chapter.
[00:26:09.160 --> 00:26:13.480]   And so I kind of had to figure it out myself how to preach the Old Testament.
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.720]   And I didn't do a good job, but I kind of had to figure it out.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:25.160]   But the point that I'm trying to make is, God, there's reason why three-fourths of the
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:28.080]   Bible is the Old Testament.
[00:26:28.080 --> 00:26:32.520]   There's a reason why every part, there's reason why genealogy is in the Old Testament.
[00:26:32.520 --> 00:26:36.520]   It's not just, "Go to sleep."
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:40.160]   It's not just to calm you down so when your blood pressure gets high, so you can just
[00:26:40.160 --> 00:26:42.360]   calm down and go to sleep.
[00:26:42.360 --> 00:26:48.160]   There's reasons why three-fourths of the written content of the Bible is the Old Testament
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:53.920]   because all of the Old Testament supports the New Testament.
[00:26:53.920 --> 00:26:58.320]   And here's the mistake, and here's the shallowness of how we understand the cross, because when
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.760]   we get to the cross without understanding how we got to the cross, there's a reason
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.600]   why there's an emphasis on grace without understanding the need for this grace.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:13.640]   And there's a reason why in our generation, anything that we talk about reverence for
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:18.880]   the thing of Christ is just a very shallow understanding.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:23.280]   Because all of that was established in the Old Testament through Israel.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.880]   The coming of the temple, the giving of the law, and the seriousness of holiness, and
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:33.440]   all of this, and character of God, the holiness of God, and how much God hates sin and judgment,
[00:27:33.440 --> 00:27:37.000]   all of this was illustrated through Israel's history.
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:43.320]   And all of this was to bring us to the cross and say, "We need Jesus."
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:46.840]   But when you kind of skim through all of that, and when you get to the cross, there's a reason
[00:27:46.840 --> 00:27:50.400]   why we end up with cheap grace.
[00:27:50.400 --> 00:27:53.360]   That we talk about grace and it's like, "Oh, God forgives no matter what we do."
[00:27:53.360 --> 00:27:57.880]   And we look at grace as a great-grandfather who just lets you get away with anything because
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:28:00.440]   He loves you so much.
[00:28:00.440 --> 00:28:07.640]   So there's an element of truth to that, but all that we know about the gospel is supported
[00:28:07.640 --> 00:28:13.420]   by years of what He has been doing through the nation of Israel.
[00:28:13.420 --> 00:28:17.500]   So if we have a shallow understanding of who God is in the Old Testament, and His work
[00:28:17.500 --> 00:28:21.480]   in the Old Testament, and what He's been doing through the temple and the laws, by the time
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:27.240]   we get to the cross, it's like one saved always saved.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:34.080]   God loves us unconditionally, which is true, but the weight of what that means is lost
[00:28:34.080 --> 00:28:39.320]   to a generation that doesn't understand that we are supported by what God's been doing
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:41.940]   through the nation of Israel.
[00:28:41.940 --> 00:28:48.440]   Why it is so imperative for us to understand what God has been doing.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:53.800]   See, that's exactly what Jesus was saying in John chapter 4, 22, talking to the Samaritan
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:54.800]   woman.
[00:28:54.800 --> 00:28:57.920]   He's saying, "Well, we're Samaritan, we're Jews, we have different ideas of how to worship
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:59.480]   God in this mountain and that mountain."
[00:28:59.480 --> 00:29:03.760]   Immediately, He corrects her.
[00:29:03.760 --> 00:29:07.920]   And He's going to rebuke Israel and the Gentiles, but before He does that, He corrects her and
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:14.440]   puts her in the right place and He says, "You worship what you do not know."
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:17.720]   It's not simply about whether you're going to worship in that mountain, but first and
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.880]   foremost, before I say anything, the God that you worship is a God that you created in your
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:23.880]   own mind.
[00:29:23.880 --> 00:29:26.200]   That is not the God of the Bible.
[00:29:26.200 --> 00:29:29.960]   You worship what you do not know, we worship what we know.
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:34.280]   And when Jesus says "we," He's not talking about the Trinity.
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:37.980]   When He says "we," He's talking about the Jews.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:43.200]   We worship what we do not know, for salvation is from the Jews.
[00:29:43.200 --> 00:29:53.560]   See, this idea of reverence and worship and repentance and restoration and refuge, forgiveness,
[00:29:53.560 --> 00:29:57.280]   all of this was illustrated in the Old Testament.
[00:29:57.280 --> 00:30:03.160]   So if we simply dismiss Israel, dismiss the Old Testament, dismiss them as a foundation,
[00:30:03.160 --> 00:30:08.120]   then again, we have a very shallow, shaky building that we're building.
[00:30:08.120 --> 00:30:13.920]   You know, the older I get, the more I appreciate my ancestors.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:22.120]   I've been watching videos of Korea, videos that I've never seen before in 1960s and 1930s.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:26.840]   They have pictures and videos from as early as 1920s, pre-war, and all this stuff.
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.720]   And it's just interesting to me because there's certain parts of Korea that I remember visiting.
[00:30:31.720 --> 00:30:35.000]   Maybe some of you guys may know that too, but I look at old videos and it's just dirt
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.600]   road and how the buildings were.
[00:30:36.600 --> 00:30:43.320]   It just kind of, even though I wasn't born at that time, I feel a certain level of connection
[00:30:43.320 --> 00:30:45.120]   because that's where my grandparents were.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:47.400]   That's where my parents came from.
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:53.160]   And then so, you know, the older I get, the more interested I am about where I came from.
[00:30:53.160 --> 00:30:54.160]   Right?
[00:30:54.160 --> 00:30:57.920]   So when you're younger, you barely have any interest in your parents.
[00:30:57.920 --> 00:30:59.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:30:59.520 --> 00:31:01.140]   You don't know how your parents met.
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:02.140]   You don't know what they like.
[00:31:02.140 --> 00:31:05.480]   I mean, maybe on Father's Day or Mother's Day or birthday, you try to figure out what
[00:31:05.480 --> 00:31:06.480]   they want to eat.
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:10.480]   But other than that, you know, it's not of interest until you get older and then you
[00:31:10.480 --> 00:31:14.440]   have some interest or your parents and the older you get from that, it's like, "Whoa,
[00:31:14.440 --> 00:31:15.440]   where did they come from?"
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:19.000]   You're asking about grandparents and then you get a little bit older, you ask even beyond
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:20.000]   that.
[00:31:20.000 --> 00:31:23.320]   There's some things that even your parents may not know.
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:28.400]   And the reason why there's interest in that is because the older we get, the more we understand
[00:31:28.400 --> 00:31:31.520]   how that line has affected us.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:36.320]   There's so much of our great grandparents and some of the pictures that you might see
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:39.000]   of them, it's like, "Huh, that looks like me."
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:42.480]   Because that's our heritage.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:48.480]   See when we see God's people, not just 2,000 years, but thousands of years even before
[00:31:48.480 --> 00:31:53.280]   Christ came, it is a reflection of where we came from.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.120]   That when He was talking about Israel, we weren't way over there.
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.920]   He had us in mind when He wrote Hosea chapter 11.
[00:32:01.920 --> 00:32:05.960]   His love goes that deep and that far.
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:09.520]   So first and foremost, He says, "Do not be arrogant."
[00:32:09.520 --> 00:32:13.920]   And that's exactly what it says in Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8.
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:18.800]   Ephesians chapter 2 verse 8, it says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:32:18.800 --> 00:32:20.760]   and this is not your own doing.
[00:32:20.760 --> 00:32:23.440]   It is a gift of God."
[00:32:23.440 --> 00:32:24.960]   Now we know that.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.840]   Again, we sing that.
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:31.280]   If you grew up in the church, "For by grace you have been saved," you guys know that song,
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:33.160]   right?
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:34.680]   But look at the second part.
[00:32:34.680 --> 00:32:38.600]   "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this is not your own doing.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   It is a gift of God, not a result of work."
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.960]   Why?
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.320]   Why didn't He invite?
[00:32:46.320 --> 00:32:50.760]   Why didn't He say, "I'm going to do my part and you're going to do your part, and there's
[00:32:50.760 --> 00:32:53.240]   a part you're going to play and there's a part that I'm going to play."
[00:32:53.240 --> 00:32:54.240]   He doesn't say that.
[00:32:54.240 --> 00:32:56.840]   He said, "None of it is yours."
[00:32:56.840 --> 00:33:05.000]   He cleansed her, washed her, regenerated her, made her pure, all unilaterally, just as the
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:09.640]   dough became holy because the first fruits were holy, and now as a result of it, we've
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:12.960]   all become holy, and it has nothing to do with you, so what?
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:18.680]   So that no one may boast.
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:24.300]   So the immediate application of the grace of God is not pride.
[00:33:24.300 --> 00:33:28.840]   So easy to say, and so hard to apply.
[00:33:28.840 --> 00:33:32.040]   So fundamental.
[00:33:32.040 --> 00:33:35.880]   You could teach this to a child, and they'll understand it at a child's level, and you
[00:33:35.880 --> 00:33:39.400]   could teach this to somebody who's been walking with the Lord for 50 years or 70 years or
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:46.400]   all their life, and they know what to say, but so difficult to apply because at the core
[00:33:46.400 --> 00:33:54.760]   of human rebellion is pride, and at the core of salvation is humility.
[00:33:54.760 --> 00:33:57.960]   And so he brings salvation by grace.
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:02.320]   He says, "So that you will not boast."
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:06.800]   Because it is your boasting that brought condemnation.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:10.400]   It is your pride that blinds you.
[00:34:10.400 --> 00:34:15.320]   It is your desire or thinking that you can somehow live outside of God that is causing
[00:34:15.320 --> 00:34:18.000]   you to run after the world.
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:20.740]   It is pride that is destroying mankind.
[00:34:20.740 --> 00:34:23.900]   It was pride that caused Satan to rebel.
[00:34:23.900 --> 00:34:26.620]   It was pride that he took a third of the angels with him.
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:30.680]   It was pride that Adam and Eve rebelled against God to think that they're going to somehow
[00:34:30.680 --> 00:34:32.880]   live without God.
[00:34:32.880 --> 00:34:36.580]   And ever since then, the core of mankind's sin is pride.
[00:34:36.580 --> 00:34:42.600]   So that's why the first thing he says, "Therefore, do not be proud."
[00:34:42.600 --> 00:34:48.240]   Do not be proud against the nation of Israel, and do not be proud.
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:53.360]   Instead, he says, "Be in awe."
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:59.280]   Because the same grace that will save the nation of Israel is the same grace that is
[00:34:59.280 --> 00:35:02.320]   causing you to stand.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:06.720]   First Corinthians 10, 12-13, "Therefore, let anyone who thinks that he stands take
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.880]   heed lest he fall.
[00:35:08.880 --> 00:35:11.440]   No temptation has overtaken you that is not common to man."
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:15.240]   When he's talking about common to man, he's talking about Israel, because that's what
[00:35:15.240 --> 00:35:17.560]   he was talking about in the previous verses.
[00:35:17.560 --> 00:35:21.640]   There's no temptation that they face that you are not going to face.
[00:35:21.640 --> 00:35:24.440]   And as they easily struggled, you can easily struggle.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.640]   God is faithful, and he will not let you be tempted beyond what you are able.
[00:35:27.640 --> 00:35:32.240]   But with temptation, he will also provide the way of escape that you may be able to
[00:35:32.240 --> 00:35:33.240]   endure it.
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:37.920]   We're going to talk more about this next week, his kindness and the severity of God.
[00:35:37.920 --> 00:35:42.100]   But let me wrap up this morning with this, and so I want to open up the communion table
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:44.960]   for us.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:51.560]   When we understand God's love for Israel, it gives us a glimpse of who he is, and it
[00:35:51.560 --> 00:35:58.720]   gives us a glimpse of who we are, and the application is obvious.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:01.080]   Application is obvious.
[00:36:01.080 --> 00:36:08.960]   As Christ was humiliated on the cross, anyone who comes to the cross must first be humiliated,
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:12.540]   must first empty himself and become nothing.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:15.240]   There is no boasting in the cross.
[00:36:15.240 --> 00:36:18.280]   There is no pride in the cross.
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:24.420]   To have life, we must first lose it.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:33.180]   Think about how much of our life is wrecked because of our pride.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:40.200]   Think about every fight between your husband and wife, that at the core of it, how much
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:44.040]   of that is pride.
[00:36:44.040 --> 00:36:50.000]   Think about how much of our rebelling against God at the core of who we are is, "I think
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:53.120]   I can do it without him.
[00:36:53.120 --> 00:36:57.520]   I think I can find life without God."
[00:36:57.520 --> 00:37:04.840]   How much of sin that reigns in mankind comes through the form of pride.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:09.400]   So the first thing that we recognize when we recognize his love and his grace and how
[00:37:09.400 --> 00:37:15.480]   he dealt with the nation of Israel and how the root supports us, therefore, do not be
[00:37:15.480 --> 00:37:18.000]   arrogant.
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:22.920]   The communion table ultimately is for that purpose.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:26.200]   It's to remind us.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   Simple breaking of the bread, pouring of his blood, it saved us.
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:36.760]   We don't come here, we're not going to invite anybody up to this table, and the only way
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:40.840]   that you can disqualify yourself from coming to this table is to somehow think that you
[00:37:40.840 --> 00:37:46.560]   earned this, and automatically you are disqualified because you do not understand this communion
[00:37:46.560 --> 00:37:48.120]   table.
[00:37:48.120 --> 00:37:53.360]   The communion table is open for us to celebrate his grace, to celebrate his love, celebrate
[00:37:53.360 --> 00:37:57.280]   justification that you and I did not deserve.
[00:37:57.280 --> 00:38:02.760]   But a reasonable response to this is to live up to the calling.
[00:38:02.760 --> 00:38:06.360]   We're going to talk about that next week, but this morning as we open up the communion
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:07.360]   table.
[00:38:07.360 --> 00:38:11.640]   Again, I want to remind you that the communion table is meant for confessing believers who
[00:38:11.640 --> 00:38:13.440]   have been baptized.
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:17.440]   And so if you have not been baptized and you haven't confessed Christ as your Lord and
[00:38:17.440 --> 00:38:20.720]   Savior, we ask that you would stay in your seat.
[00:38:20.720 --> 00:38:24.840]   And again, if you want to be baptized, we ask that you come and talk to us, talk to
[00:38:24.840 --> 00:38:28.140]   one of the leaders, and we'll sit down with you and explain if you have some questions
[00:38:28.140 --> 00:38:29.740]   about that.
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:37.020]   Those of you who are going to come to the table, we ask that first, come humbly, recognizing
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:40.060]   salvation that you and I did not deserve.
[00:38:40.060 --> 00:38:43.740]   And second, come celebrating, right?
[00:38:43.740 --> 00:38:47.620]   Come celebrate the life that Christ has given us.
[00:38:47.620 --> 00:38:50.140]   And what does that mean for us?
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:53.900]   So I'm going to read a passage and I'm going to open up the communion table.
[00:38:53.900 --> 00:38:55.420]   Just be in prayer.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.540]   There's unconfessed sins.
[00:38:56.540 --> 00:38:59.460]   Take some time to pray and confess that before God.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:03.100]   The only way that you and I can become righteous is from confession and forgiveness.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:06.020]   So again, we ask that you would take some time to do that genuinely.
[00:39:06.020 --> 00:39:09.880]   And then when you are ready, again, come toward the middle.
[00:39:09.880 --> 00:39:13.780]   So if you're sitting right in the front, you know, I'm not going to be legalistic and ask
[00:39:13.780 --> 00:39:14.780]   you to go all the way around.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:16.420]   Just come and take it.
[00:39:16.420 --> 00:39:17.980]   Don't create traffic in the middle.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:21.820]   So everybody else, just come through the side, take it, and go down the middle.
[00:39:21.820 --> 00:39:25.620]   And I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to be reflective and in prayer as our
[00:39:25.620 --> 00:39:28.220]   worship team comes and leads us.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:32.860]   And really, this is a time, even though we are, it signifies the union of the body of
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:38.020]   Christ, but ultimately the unity happens because individually we're right with God.
[00:39:38.020 --> 00:39:41.500]   And so I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray when you're ready, one by one,
[00:39:41.500 --> 00:39:42.780]   come up.
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:46.820]   In 1 Corinthians chapter 11, verse 23, it says, "For I received from the Lord what I
[00:39:46.820 --> 00:39:52.740]   also delivered to you, that the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed took bread.
[00:39:52.740 --> 00:39:57.060]   And when he had given things, he broke it and said, 'This is my body, which is for you.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:39:59.300]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:39:59.300 --> 00:40:03.700]   In the same way, also he took the cup after supper, saying, 'This cup is a new covenant
[00:40:03.700 --> 00:40:04.860]   in my blood.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:08.520]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:40:08.520 --> 00:40:13.620]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until
[00:40:13.620 --> 00:40:14.620]   he comes.'"
[00:40:14.620 --> 00:40:19.220]   Let's pray.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:28.620]   Heavenly Father, we come to this sacred time in reverence and in awe and in humility.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:33.400]   I pray, Father God, that you would sanctify your church.
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:39.980]   Help us, Lord, to open our eyes, see if there's any hurtful ways in us.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:46.060]   Help us to put away our pride and embrace the love of Christ and his gentleness.
[00:40:46.060 --> 00:40:52.060]   I pray, Father God, that this communion table would sanctify your church.
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:56.260]   We ask, Lord God, help us to think deeply and meditate, and that through your word that
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:59.500]   you would continue to speak to us and bear fruit.
[00:40:59.500 --> 00:41:01.940]   May this time be a pleasing aroma to you.
[00:41:01.940 --> 00:41:03.820]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
