[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.800]   This morning I'd like to have you guys think about a specific term, the bar.
[00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:10.800]   Okay?
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:11.800]   The bar.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.800]   And the reason why I want to use this term as a bar is because we want to talk about
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.240]   standards in our lives.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:20.960]   Okay?
[00:00:20.960 --> 00:00:26.920]   Expectations that we have of ourselves, expectations that others have of us, expectations that
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:30.880]   the Bible has of us, expectations that God has of us.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:34.480]   These are all standards by which we're supposed to evaluate life.
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:40.080]   These are what's more standards by which we're supposed to be striving for in order to accomplish.
[00:00:40.080 --> 00:00:41.080]   Right?
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:45.480]   And the fact of the matter is we are always regularly operating by certain standards.
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:49.060]   We're always evaluating things by a certain bar.
[00:00:49.060 --> 00:00:54.060]   For example, you take a look at a room and the cleanliness of the room.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:58.000]   You have three individuals who are looking at the exact same room.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.360]   Potentially you can get three different interpretations.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:05.200]   A young student might look at it and be like, "Looks good to me."
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:08.400]   Another person might look at it and say, "She's really disheveled."
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.760]   The other person could look at it and be like, "I can't stay here.
[00:01:11.760 --> 00:01:13.360]   I can't be here because it's so disgusting."
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:14.360]   Right?
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:15.360]   Why?
[00:01:15.360 --> 00:01:19.880]   Because they're operating off of some standard evaluating this is not clean or this is fine.
[00:01:19.880 --> 00:01:20.880]   Right?
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:23.860]   And the reason why I bring this up is because I would like you to think about and ask the
[00:01:23.860 --> 00:01:29.720]   question, "How high is God's standard for you?"
[00:01:29.720 --> 00:01:31.480]   Think about that.
[00:01:31.480 --> 00:01:34.000]   How high is God's standard for you?
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:39.040]   When it comes to things like in every facet of our lives, the scripture actually speaks
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.000]   about certain standards.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.320]   So for example, I want to list off a few.
[00:01:43.320 --> 00:01:47.800]   We have standards of how God wants us to forgive those who ask for forgiveness.
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:50.840]   And the standard is 70 times 7.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.560]   And all the disciples said, "How can we do that?"
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:58.240]   When we have standards of how we're supposed to be patient with one another, God describes
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:02:02.440]   it as long suffering like I've been with y'all for thousands of years.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:03.440]   Right?
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.320]   And it's, "How can we do that?"
[00:02:05.320 --> 00:02:12.400]   When it comes to even topics of our holiness and purity, scripture says, "Not even a hint."
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:17.680]   You're so set apart there shouldn't even be a residue, not even a hint of immorality among
[00:02:17.680 --> 00:02:18.680]   you.
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:23.640]   When you think about other standards of our joyfulness, of our thanksgiving, it's always
[00:02:23.640 --> 00:02:28.360]   unceasingly even when you experience trials of many kinds.
[00:02:28.360 --> 00:02:35.480]   So what I'm highlighting is God's standard for us in every aspect of our lives, godly
[00:02:35.480 --> 00:02:44.340]   living, holiness, mercy, grace, love, and the list can go on, is perfection.
[00:02:44.340 --> 00:02:50.760]   It's so incredibly high that the natural response should have been, "Huh?
[00:02:50.760 --> 00:02:53.320]   I'm going to look up, I'm going to look down, I'm going to be like, 'I can't do it.'"
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:54.320]   Right?
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:56.120]   Like that's the kind of natural reaction that we might have.
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.720]   Well, the problem is sometimes that is the reaction we have.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:05.400]   Unfortunately, sometimes we Christians run into a problem where we have the tendency,
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:09.960]   where the standards that we set for our life of what is normative, we assume is dictated
[00:03:09.960 --> 00:03:12.760]   by my deficiency rather than God's character.
[00:03:12.760 --> 00:03:14.700]   Let me repeat that.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:20.060]   The standards that we set in certain elements of our lives, arenas of our lives, we make
[00:03:20.060 --> 00:03:26.100]   the false assumption that it's dictated by my deficiency rather than God's character.
[00:03:26.100 --> 00:03:29.900]   What I mean by that is as you live your life, you're going to experience certain things
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:32.380]   where you're deficient, meaning you're weak.
[00:03:32.380 --> 00:03:35.620]   You're not capable, got no skills kind of moment, right?
[00:03:35.620 --> 00:03:37.860]   Like I don't have the capacity to do this.
[00:03:37.860 --> 00:03:39.860]   And what ends up happening is you feel discouraged.
[00:03:39.860 --> 00:03:45.840]   What ends up happening is you start to also change the expectation you have of yourself.
[00:03:45.840 --> 00:03:49.780]   And then if you continue to live life, you'll also look around and then you'll validate
[00:03:49.780 --> 00:03:50.780]   it.
[00:03:50.780 --> 00:03:51.780]   Why?
[00:03:51.780 --> 00:03:52.780]   Because you'll look at everybody else and say, "See?"
[00:03:52.780 --> 00:03:53.780]   Right?
[00:03:53.780 --> 00:03:58.180]   You look at the deficiencies and failures of others and then come to a conclusion, therefore,
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:04:01.860]   God does not expect of us more than we can do.
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:02.860]   Is that biblical?
[00:04:02.860 --> 00:04:06.460]   And my case today is going to be no.
[00:04:06.460 --> 00:04:13.540]   The Word of God shows to us the perfect standard of God in every realm of life and typically
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:17.980]   it shocks us because it's so much higher than we presume.
[00:04:17.980 --> 00:04:25.060]   There are moments when we are thought to believe that the standards are relegated to what patterns
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:26.060]   we set.
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:32.220]   But we recall God has ordained a perfect pattern in Christ.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:37.660]   So direct question to you right now, how are you doing in your standards?
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:43.260]   How are you doing in the expectations and the levels that you're trying to pursue?
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:47.980]   Have you settled for something that is far less than what God has ordained?
[00:04:47.980 --> 00:04:52.900]   Have you settled for a standard that is more appropriate just simply to you or to man than
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:56.300]   what is acceptable to God Almighty?
[00:04:56.300 --> 00:05:00.500]   Now as we say this, this is sometimes paradoxical, right?
[00:05:00.500 --> 00:05:05.660]   It's like, wow, it's true, biblical standards appear.
[00:05:05.660 --> 00:05:11.260]   But I see with my eyes and we also know through biblical content that we are deficient.
[00:05:11.260 --> 00:05:12.500]   So how do we navigate this?
[00:05:12.500 --> 00:05:15.020]   And we're going to talk about that today.
[00:05:15.020 --> 00:05:19.620]   But I would like to take a moment to encourage you before I go into this because every time
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:24.740]   I get an opportunity to speak to our church broadly, I want to always say thank you.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:28.380]   I am very thankful to God that we are here.
[00:05:28.380 --> 00:05:32.020]   As a matter of fact, just this Saturday I was sitting with the leaders and I told them,
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:36.460]   you know, right now my heart is so thankful because every time I'm at church I look around,
[00:05:36.460 --> 00:05:40.060]   there's people meeting in rooms, encouraging each other, praying for each other.
[00:05:40.060 --> 00:05:43.220]   There are people regularly emailing me, can we study the Bible together?
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:46.060]   Every time like, you know, one of the pastors says, hey, we're going to read this book,
[00:05:46.060 --> 00:05:47.580]   there's like immediate sign up.
[00:05:47.580 --> 00:05:51.660]   There are people who are wanting to get engaged, wanting to serve, wanting to grow.
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:52.660]   That's the truth, right?
[00:05:52.660 --> 00:05:55.700]   And I am so encouraged by that.
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:06:01.000]   And then yet this passage that I read, then all the more actually speaks to you.
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.340]   Rather than this passage in Colossians chapter 1 speaking to individuals who have no desire,
[00:06:05.340 --> 00:06:10.100]   no standard and are completely dead in their faith, the passage is actually speaking more
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:13.240]   so to a context like ours.
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:17.460]   Where perhaps we're growing, but we need to hear all the more.
[00:06:17.460 --> 00:06:22.400]   That God's standard is still yet farther above than we can imagine.
[00:06:22.400 --> 00:06:27.120]   Why do I say this is because Apostle Paul in immediate context is in a scenario where
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:29.780]   he himself is in a dire situation.
[00:06:29.780 --> 00:06:33.740]   We believe Apostle Paul is writing this letter from prison.
[00:06:33.740 --> 00:06:37.260]   But the reason why he's writing this is because he got a report.
[00:06:37.260 --> 00:06:38.660]   He got word.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:43.980]   He got news from Epaphras, his fellow servant of the gospel, that people in Colossae, in
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:47.660]   the city, are responding to truth.
[00:06:47.660 --> 00:06:53.160]   If you turn your eyes over to chapter 1 verse 3, this is what the scripture says.
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:57.200]   It says, "We give thanks to God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, praying always for
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:07:02.600]   you since we heard of your faith in Christ Jesus and the love that you have for all the
[00:07:02.600 --> 00:07:06.720]   saints because of the hope laid out for you in heaven of which you previously heard in
[00:07:06.720 --> 00:07:09.440]   the word of truth, the gospel."
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:15.020]   So when you think about that, Apostle Paul, when he sees the Colossians church, he's seeing
[00:07:15.020 --> 00:07:20.980]   faith, love, and hope, the trifecta of Christian genuineness and sincerity, right?
[00:07:20.980 --> 00:07:25.500]   He's seeing them loving people and he's seeing them hoping in eternity.
[00:07:25.500 --> 00:07:28.940]   So if you think about it, they're doing great.
[00:07:28.940 --> 00:07:31.500]   They're doing fine.
[00:07:31.500 --> 00:07:34.060]   But does that mean then that he has no words for them?
[00:07:34.060 --> 00:07:36.380]   Actually, on the contrary.
[00:07:36.380 --> 00:07:41.500]   We believe actually, although sometimes, we typically only tend to pray for the people
[00:07:41.500 --> 00:07:49.340]   who are hurting, having a tough time, in weakness or sin or failure, Apostle Paul here is actually
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.700]   praying for those who are doing well.
[00:07:52.700 --> 00:07:54.780]   And so let's read again together what he says.
[00:07:54.780 --> 00:07:57.300]   He says, "For this reason also," right?
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:01.300]   Because the gospel is powerful and is powerfully working in them, he says, "Since the day we
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:05.660]   heard of it, we have not ceased to pray for you and to ask that you may be filled with
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:10.500]   the knowledge of his will in all spiritual wisdom and understanding so that you will
[00:08:10.500 --> 00:08:15.420]   walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please him in all respects, bearing fruit in every
[00:08:15.420 --> 00:08:20.220]   good work and increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthened with all power according
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:25.900]   to his glorious might, for the attaining of all steadfastness and patience, joyously giving
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:30.900]   thanks to the Father who has qualified us to share in the inheritance of the saints
[00:08:30.900 --> 00:08:32.540]   and light."
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:36.940]   I want to give to you the main point and thrust of the entire sermon.
[00:08:36.940 --> 00:08:43.020]   Here is the exhortation for you in the form of Apostle Paul's prayer for you.
[00:08:43.020 --> 00:08:49.020]   That to those who are responding to the gospel and growing, he prays that we would not settle
[00:08:49.020 --> 00:08:54.700]   for great, we're doing okay, but that there would be a fullness.
[00:08:54.700 --> 00:09:00.260]   And that is why the title of the sermon is called, "Raise the Bar to Full."
[00:09:00.260 --> 00:09:03.560]   We're not even talking about, "Hey, let's just move and progress from the point that
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:09.940]   you are now," but rather having a standard that is of God and his perfection.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.780]   Having a standard that is above and beyond your own personal vision for your own life,
[00:09:13.780 --> 00:09:19.860]   but rather something that exceeds and surpasses the expectations of what's norm for all the
[00:09:19.860 --> 00:09:21.900]   people around you.
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:26.460]   Because Apostle Paul surely does not in this context give them a pat on the back and say,
[00:09:26.460 --> 00:09:27.460]   "Great.
[00:09:27.460 --> 00:09:28.940]   I am so happy for you."
[00:09:29.660 --> 00:09:34.300]   No, he says, "I pray for you that you would have God in full."
[00:09:34.300 --> 00:09:36.440]   So let's talk about this fullness.
[00:09:36.440 --> 00:09:40.420]   What kind of fullness are we talking about and why am I making such a big deal of this?
[00:09:40.420 --> 00:09:44.760]   Well, if you notice, just from the very beginning, right?
[00:09:44.760 --> 00:09:50.220]   Just from the very beginning, you notice how Apostle Paul's prayer has so many of these,
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.780]   like I can say, superlative words, right?
[00:09:53.780 --> 00:09:58.220]   He says things like, "May you be filled," which literally means full to the top.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:09:59.980]   You're capped off, okay?
[00:09:59.980 --> 00:10:04.980]   And then he talks about how in all spiritual wisdom and understanding, as you walk through
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:08.300]   the passage, I'm just going to accentuate some of these words for you.
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:15.940]   Think about this, that he desires us to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord, okay?
[00:10:15.940 --> 00:10:18.260]   He doesn't say, "I want you to walk in a progressive fashion."
[00:10:18.260 --> 00:10:20.940]   He says, "I want you to walk in a manner worthy of the Lord."
[00:10:20.940 --> 00:10:26.820]   We could possibly just stop there and all of us be floored, thinking, "What?
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:28.140]   That's the standard?"
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:29.140]   But then he goes on.
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.700]   "So that you would please Him in what respect?
[00:10:31.700 --> 00:10:32.700]   All respects."
[00:10:32.700 --> 00:10:36.700]   And then he says he wants us to be bearing fruit in every good work, increasing in the
[00:10:36.700 --> 00:10:37.700]   knowledge of God.
[00:10:37.700 --> 00:10:42.060]   And then he says, "Strengthened with all power, according to His glorious might."
[00:10:42.060 --> 00:10:45.260]   Not according to ours or not according to somebody else, not according to circumstance
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:49.540]   or situation, but according to His glorious might.
[00:10:49.540 --> 00:10:56.380]   "For the attaining of all steadfastness, patience, joyfully giving thanks to the Father."
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:11:02.460]   Do you notice how many all-complete, these suppurative words that Apostle Paul uses?
[00:11:02.460 --> 00:11:08.500]   And that's why I want us to think about this idea of having the bar raised to full, because
[00:11:08.500 --> 00:11:13.780]   truthfully speaking, I actually kind of feel a little bit silly.
[00:11:13.780 --> 00:11:17.380]   If I'm given a sermon saying, "Guys, let's do better.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:19.740]   We can do better."
[00:11:19.740 --> 00:11:25.380]   That's a little silly, considering the fact that Apostle Paul says, "No, we want to attain
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:31.580]   to the fullness of His glory, fullness of strength."
[00:11:31.580 --> 00:11:34.500]   Walking in a manner that is worthy of God.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:37.860]   This is not, "Hey guys, let's try a little harder.
[00:11:37.860 --> 00:11:40.260]   Let's do more."
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.140]   That's not it at all, is it?
[00:11:42.140 --> 00:11:48.060]   We're talking about a kind of standard that Apostle Paul is giving us a vision for, which
[00:11:48.060 --> 00:11:50.140]   is completeness in Christ.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.100]   As a matter of fact, he says it very explicitly.
[00:11:52.100 --> 00:11:56.220]   If you turn your eyes to Colossians 1, verse 28.
[00:11:56.220 --> 00:12:02.020]   In Colossians 1, verse 28, Apostle Paul says this.
[00:12:02.020 --> 00:12:07.860]   He says, "We proclaim Him, admonishing every man, teaching every man with all wisdom, so
[00:12:07.860 --> 00:12:12.700]   that we may present every man complete in Christ.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:19.260]   For this purpose also I labor, striving according to His power, which mightily works within
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   me."
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.020]   Do you see his vision?
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:26.300]   Do you see his drive and the purpose that he's trying to pursue?
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:30.980]   He is not trying to do small fixes, small improvements.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:37.900]   He is seeking completeness in Christ, presenting you as one who is full in the Lord.
[00:12:37.900 --> 00:12:42.220]   So again, there is a question for us.
[00:12:42.220 --> 00:12:47.460]   Is that the kind of vision you've bought into?
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:53.220]   Is that the kind of vision you've bought into and therefore pray for yourself?
[00:12:53.220 --> 00:12:56.180]   Is that the kind of attitude you are drawing?
[00:12:56.180 --> 00:13:03.500]   I have to say in this generation, what I feel most often is that there are this kind of
[00:13:03.500 --> 00:13:05.500]   "it's okay" mentality.
[00:13:05.500 --> 00:13:11.300]   I think that, those three words, "it is okay," "I'm okay" kind of mentality has been a great
[00:13:11.300 --> 00:13:13.260]   disservice to us.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.740]   People are asking you, "Hey, how are you doing spiritually?"
[00:13:15.740 --> 00:13:17.700]   "I'm okay," right?
[00:13:17.700 --> 00:13:19.940]   "We're fine."
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:22.860]   That kind of mentality is so detrimental.
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:24.780]   It betrays what Paul is trying to say.
[00:13:24.780 --> 00:13:28.980]   I want you to think about this even from, let's say, our enemy's perspective.
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:33.180]   As I try to, again, emphasize the importance of this idea that we want to strive for the
[00:13:33.180 --> 00:13:38.140]   high perfect standard of God, think about it from our enemy's perspective.
[00:13:38.140 --> 00:13:41.420]   To our enemy, this is the best.
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:44.060]   When Christians say, "I'm okay.
[00:13:44.060 --> 00:13:45.580]   I'm doing fine."
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:46.580]   Now I get it.
[00:13:46.580 --> 00:13:48.020]   We don't want to be awkward.
[00:13:48.020 --> 00:13:49.180]   So this is the normal way we talk.
[00:13:49.180 --> 00:13:51.900]   If someone asks you, "Hey man, how are you doing?"
[00:13:51.900 --> 00:13:54.860]   You're not going to be like, "Well, I'm doing my best to strive for the perfect standard
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   of God."
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.140]   You know, like we're not going to do that because then that would be really awkward,
[00:13:58.140 --> 00:13:59.140]   right?
[00:13:59.140 --> 00:14:02.860]   And then people might be like, "All right, calm down."
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:07.980]   But at the same time, all I'm trying to do is say, not trying to change the way you talk,
[00:14:07.980 --> 00:14:10.200]   but trying to challenge us to be sober.
[00:14:10.200 --> 00:14:13.820]   If we talk like that, I hope we're not thinking like that.
[00:14:13.820 --> 00:14:18.820]   I hope we're not thinking that I'm just simply fine because in our enemy's position, he is
[00:14:18.820 --> 00:14:20.820]   thinking that makes my job easy.
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:21.820]   Why?
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:26.300]   Because for our enemy, he reserves his greatest efforts for those who have great potential
[00:14:26.300 --> 00:14:29.500]   to do great work for the Lord, right?
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:31.340]   Our enemy is fighting against what?
[00:14:31.340 --> 00:14:33.180]   People who are not moving?
[00:14:33.180 --> 00:14:37.060]   No, rather he's thinking, "I want everybody to think they're okay.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.440]   I want everybody to think they're fine."
[00:14:39.440 --> 00:14:41.660]   That makes his job easy.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:46.300]   Brothers and sisters, the challenge today then is for you to buy into this mentality
[00:14:46.300 --> 00:14:47.580]   and this ambition.
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:52.940]   I want every single one of us to have certain visions that are lofty, and that vision is
[00:14:52.940 --> 00:14:55.660]   given to us.
[00:14:55.660 --> 00:14:58.180]   It's straight given to us from the Word of God.
[00:14:58.180 --> 00:15:02.620]   And it's my personal conviction, whether you are lazy, whether you're just a sloth, you
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:03.780]   still have vision.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:05.140]   That's your vision.
[00:15:05.140 --> 00:15:08.020]   Your kingdom is ease.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:11.780]   So we want a vision like this, the perfections of Christ.
[00:15:11.780 --> 00:15:17.020]   And therefore then we should be able to say in our hearts and pray, "God, admonish me,
[00:15:17.020 --> 00:15:19.780]   teach me, give me that wisdom.
[00:15:19.780 --> 00:15:21.980]   Lead me in all completeness in Christ.
[00:15:21.980 --> 00:15:25.060]   I am not okay by the standards of this normative.
[00:15:25.060 --> 00:15:30.220]   I am not even okay with the standard of what is okay in our context of our church.
[00:15:30.220 --> 00:15:33.100]   I will strive for your standard."
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:38.420]   And we have to be, by definition, that kind of broken individual who is not looking at
[00:15:38.420 --> 00:15:41.860]   our own deficiencies and saying, "But I can't."
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:47.100]   But by faith we are receiving the vision of God.
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:48.900]   Let me highlight that again.
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:54.100]   I am willing to guess that every single one of us, we've heard sermons like this before,
[00:15:54.100 --> 00:15:56.660]   strive for the high standard of God.
[00:15:56.660 --> 00:16:01.900]   But in actuality, when we live our lives, with our eyes, we see more of our deficiency.
[00:16:01.900 --> 00:16:04.080]   With our eyes, we see more of our weakness.
[00:16:04.080 --> 00:16:06.780]   With our eyes, we see more of how we fail.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:09.260]   What's more, we see how everybody else does too.
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:13.420]   It takes faith to say, "God, I still believe that's your standard."
[00:16:13.420 --> 00:16:16.360]   It takes faith when you say, "God, you have qualified me."
[00:16:16.360 --> 00:16:18.980]   It takes faith to say, "God, I have your strength."
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.260]   Amen?
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:26.860]   And so by faith, we have to go fight against the things that we see with our eyes and say,
[00:16:26.860 --> 00:16:28.580]   "God, I accept your perfect standard."
[00:16:29.580 --> 00:16:34.020]   Now, in order to highlight this even more, I want to give you guys some specific tangible
[00:16:34.020 --> 00:16:38.500]   questions to check, to do a quick cross-check.
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:45.180]   And this question comes by way of asking you, "Do you then have any difficulty receiving
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:49.700]   challenges from other people?"
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:54.060]   Do you have any difficulty receiving instruction and challenges from other individuals?
[00:16:54.060 --> 00:16:57.980]   But a more maybe precise way to ask this question is, "Do you have difficulty when you are
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:17:01.540]   challenged even though you think you're doing okay?"
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:02.540]   Right?
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:04.180]   Let me repeat that.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:08.900]   Do you have difficulty receiving instruction and challenge when you think you're doing
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:10.180]   fine?
[00:17:10.180 --> 00:17:14.340]   And to make it even more tangible, I'm going to call out some possible scenarios.
[00:17:14.340 --> 00:17:16.980]   First, husbands.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:20.500]   Are there moments when you think you're trying your best, loving your wife, leading your
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:23.300]   family, and then your wife comes to nag you?
[00:17:23.300 --> 00:17:24.300]   Don't answer that.
[00:17:24.300 --> 00:17:25.300]   It's a trap question.
[00:17:25.300 --> 00:17:26.300]   Okay?
[00:17:26.300 --> 00:17:31.060]   But I can imagine that many men who are married could potentially feel that way.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:35.060]   Like, "I'm doing the best I can, working hard, you know, earning that bread," all that kind
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:36.060]   of stuff.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:39.220]   And then the wife comes along and says, "I just feel like you don't share.
[00:17:39.220 --> 00:17:40.740]   You don't share your thoughts.
[00:17:40.740 --> 00:17:41.980]   I don't know what you're thinking.
[00:17:41.980 --> 00:17:43.860]   Could you share more?"
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:44.860]   Right?
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.500]   And the guy, how do you respond?
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.220]   "What do you want me to share?"
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:50.220]   Right?
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:52.180]   "What do you want from me?"
[00:17:52.180 --> 00:17:54.940]   Or if the wife says, "I just feel like you're not being considerate.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.340]   You go take off and do your task and do your errands and you do your job, but you never
[00:17:59.340 --> 00:18:00.340]   really consider me."
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:03.740]   And the guy's sitting there thinking, "Just ask.
[00:18:03.740 --> 00:18:05.100]   What do you want from me?"
[00:18:05.100 --> 00:18:06.100]   You know?
[00:18:06.100 --> 00:18:09.940]   Like, those are possible scenarios that could potentially happen.
[00:18:09.940 --> 00:18:15.300]   Now wives, wouldn't it be awesome if the husbands completely turned that attitude around?
[00:18:15.300 --> 00:18:18.060]   And they're like, "Oh, you want to talk about it?
[00:18:18.060 --> 00:18:19.060]   Let's sit down on the couch.
[00:18:19.060 --> 00:18:20.980]   This is great.
[00:18:20.980 --> 00:18:22.540]   Inspire me.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   Make me a better husband.
[00:18:23.940 --> 00:18:24.940]   Give me more."
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:25.940]   Right?
[00:18:25.940 --> 00:18:29.220]   Can you imagine if a husband received that kind of challenge that way?
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:30.220]   Right?
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.140]   "You want me to be more considerate?"
[00:18:32.140 --> 00:18:34.980]   Rather than thinking like, "Oh my goodness.
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:36.700]   You don't think I've been considerate?"
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:37.700]   You know?
[00:18:37.700 --> 00:18:39.620]   Rather than thinking like, "I feel really underappreciated.
[00:18:39.620 --> 00:18:41.340]   Do you know how much I think about you?
[00:18:41.340 --> 00:18:42.340]   I married you.
[00:18:42.340 --> 00:18:43.340]   Look at your finger."
[00:18:43.340 --> 00:18:44.340]   Right?
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.140]   Like, you could think like that.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:53.700]   But, but, if you flip it around, the guy could be thinking, "Give me more.
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:56.620]   Because my vision is not this.
[00:18:56.620 --> 00:18:57.620]   Do not get me wrong.
[00:18:57.620 --> 00:19:01.700]   My vision for my husband role is not status quo.
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.420]   I want to be the best husband.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:05.300]   I want to be perfect in Christ.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:12.060]   I want to be like Christ who washes his wife, leads his wife, sacrifices, loves her to death.
[00:19:12.060 --> 00:19:13.420]   So give it to me.
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:15.020]   Tell me how I can improve."
[00:19:15.020 --> 00:19:17.580]   Can you imagine what the lady would say?
[00:19:17.580 --> 00:19:19.580]   "What's going on?"
[00:19:19.580 --> 00:19:20.580]   Right?
[00:19:20.580 --> 00:19:22.220]   It would be weird.
[00:19:22.220 --> 00:19:23.220]   Students.
[00:19:23.220 --> 00:19:28.420]   Because for a lot of the students, your parents are still trying to put their input into your
[00:19:28.420 --> 00:19:29.420]   life.
[00:19:29.420 --> 00:19:30.420]   Right?
[00:19:30.420 --> 00:19:31.820]   They're trying to tell you what to do, how to manage your time.
[00:19:31.820 --> 00:19:34.060]   And you're sitting there like, "I'm a grown man.
[00:19:34.060 --> 00:19:35.060]   All right?"
[00:19:35.060 --> 00:19:36.060]   You know?
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:37.060]   You have your independence.
[00:19:37.060 --> 00:19:38.060]   I'm going to be honest with you.
[00:19:38.060 --> 00:19:39.060]   That never goes away.
[00:19:39.060 --> 00:19:40.620]   And I've got my own kids and family.
[00:19:40.620 --> 00:19:41.980]   My mom still does the same thing.
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:42.980]   Right?
[00:19:42.980 --> 00:19:43.980]   It's just not going to get better.
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:45.740]   Can you imagine rather than saying, "Get off my back.
[00:19:45.740 --> 00:19:46.740]   I know what I'm doing.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:47.740]   I'm mature.
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:48.740]   Okay?"
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:50.940]   What if you turned around and said, "Thank you.
[00:19:50.940 --> 00:19:54.260]   I know you're trying to make me a responsible, mature adult.
[00:19:54.260 --> 00:19:56.060]   Let me think about how I'm using my time."
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   You know?
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:19:58.060]   Like, can you imagine what they would say?
[00:19:58.060 --> 00:20:01.300]   They'd be like, "Uh, this is awkward."
[00:20:01.300 --> 00:20:02.300]   Right?
[00:20:02.300 --> 00:20:03.740]   Like, turn that around.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:05.580]   And especially in the workplace.
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:06.580]   You're working hard.
[00:20:06.580 --> 00:20:09.820]   Nowadays, it's not abnormal for a lot of people to put in extra hours.
[00:20:09.820 --> 00:20:10.820]   Right?
[00:20:10.820 --> 00:20:11.820]   They put in extra hours.
[00:20:11.820 --> 00:20:13.340]   They're putting in like nine, ten hours.
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:14.620]   Some of you guys even more.
[00:20:14.620 --> 00:20:16.180]   Your boss comes around and is like, "You missed this."
[00:20:16.180 --> 00:20:17.940]   And you're just like, "That's it.
[00:20:17.940 --> 00:20:18.940]   I quit."
[00:20:18.940 --> 00:20:19.940]   You know?
[00:20:19.940 --> 00:20:22.100]   Like, your boss comes around and is like, "Why did you forget to do that?"
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:24.140]   And you're like, "Do you know how hard I'm working?"
[00:20:24.140 --> 00:20:25.140]   Right?
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:27.740]   Like, you can get really, really angry.
[00:20:27.740 --> 00:20:30.060]   But what if you turn around and it's like, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:20:30.060 --> 00:20:31.060]   I missed it.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:33.100]   Thank you so much for pointing that out to me.
[00:20:33.100 --> 00:20:34.860]   You know, I need your help to get that done.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:36.340]   Can you help me?"
[00:20:36.340 --> 00:20:39.420]   Can you imagine how different that would be?
[00:20:39.420 --> 00:20:41.260]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:20:41.260 --> 00:20:44.700]   I am not saying that your boss is always right.
[00:20:44.700 --> 00:20:47.980]   I am not saying that your, you know, parents are always right.
[00:20:47.980 --> 00:20:50.580]   I am not saying that your spouse is always right.
[00:20:50.580 --> 00:20:51.780]   That is not what I'm saying.
[00:20:51.780 --> 00:20:56.020]   I am asking you, where is your heart when you are challenged in that moment?
[00:20:56.020 --> 00:21:00.620]   How are you in your attitude receiving the challenge when you believe, "I didn't sin.
[00:21:00.620 --> 00:21:01.620]   I didn't hurt you.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:03.500]   Why are you asking me to do this stuff?"
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.740]   Where is your heart?
[00:21:05.740 --> 00:21:07.500]   Where is your vision?
[00:21:07.500 --> 00:21:09.540]   Is your vision like, "I'm fine.
[00:21:09.540 --> 00:21:12.780]   Why are you making me do more?"
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.820]   Or is your vision, "Thank you.
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:15.820]   Let me check myself.
[00:21:15.820 --> 00:21:20.860]   Am I achieving the fullness that God wants me to achieve?"
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:24.300]   That's what I'm challenging you to do.
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:27.260]   Not just simply challenging you to be a doormat and have everybody run over you.
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:32.540]   I'm challenging you to think, "Is my heart in a condition where you will readily assess
[00:21:32.540 --> 00:21:33.540]   yourself?
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:34.540]   You will be broken.
[00:21:34.540 --> 00:21:36.420]   I know I'm already working hard.
[00:21:36.420 --> 00:21:38.540]   I know I'm already trying my best.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:42.620]   Thank you because God has called me to more."
[00:21:42.620 --> 00:21:45.380]   That's the kind of hard attitude I'm trying to inspire in you today.
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:47.340]   It is above and beyond intellectual.
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:50.100]   It's above and beyond just simple fixes.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:53.660]   We want to achieve, too, the fullness that God wants for us.
[00:21:53.660 --> 00:21:58.700]   More specifically in this passage, then, Apostle Paul leads us down some of these areas that
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:21:59.940]   we need to be full.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:04.900]   The first exhortation is this.
[00:22:04.900 --> 00:22:07.100]   The challenge comes by way of command.
[00:22:07.100 --> 00:22:10.660]   It says, "Raise the bar to full knowledge."
[00:22:10.660 --> 00:22:13.660]   Raise the bar to full knowledge.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:18.540]   As we look at this passage, it's awesome because Apostle Paul reinforces the idea with three
[00:22:18.540 --> 00:22:19.540]   synonymous terms.
[00:22:19.540 --> 00:22:25.460]   He says, "I want you to have, be filled, topped off and capped with the knowledge of
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:31.940]   God's will, with much more spiritual wisdom and all understanding."
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:33.260]   I love that.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.780]   Now recently, we had an exam, an eldership candidacy exam for our brother James Hong,
[00:22:38.780 --> 00:22:41.380]   who I love dearly, and he did an awesome job.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:48.420]   As I was sitting there, I was both, on a human level, very impressed, on a spiritual level,
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:49.420]   challenged.
[00:22:49.420 --> 00:22:51.660]   I was so challenged.
[00:22:51.660 --> 00:22:55.820]   Here at this church, we believe in the high authority of the Word of God, but what would
[00:22:55.820 --> 00:22:58.980]   that mean if we didn't know the content of it?
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:02.380]   To believe in the authority, sufficiency, and inerrancy of the Bible and yet not know
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:06.220]   the content, it would mean nothing.
[00:23:06.220 --> 00:23:10.660]   During that exam, I felt challenged, like, "Oh my goodness, I've got to know this stuff,"
[00:23:10.660 --> 00:23:14.460]   especially because there was a question like, "What are the names of the cities of refuge
[00:23:14.460 --> 00:23:16.580]   in the Old Testament?"
[00:23:16.580 --> 00:23:18.260]   Then describe it.
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:19.260]   How do people get there?
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:20.420]   How does that point to Christ?
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:24.180]   It was going down the list of just describing, naming them all.
[00:23:24.180 --> 00:23:27.660]   Some guy next to me gave me the elbow and was like, "Hey, do you remember that from
[00:23:27.660 --> 00:23:28.660]   your ordination exam?"
[00:23:28.660 --> 00:23:29.660]   "Yeah, right here."
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:37.260]   I was like, "It was hard."
[00:23:37.260 --> 00:23:41.300]   Then I felt that conviction, like, "I should know this stuff."
[00:23:41.300 --> 00:23:44.620]   Because honestly speaking, it points to Christ.
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:46.980]   I felt so, so challenged.
[00:23:46.980 --> 00:23:52.060]   Now, obviously, God is not challenging us to say, "I want you to know facts."
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:56.220]   I remember the exam questions of list all the cities that Apostle Paul visited in all
[00:23:56.220 --> 00:23:58.180]   three of his missionary journeys.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:02.140]   I remember I memorized an acrostic and all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:02.140 --> 00:24:07.540]   Knowledge is obtaining facts and information, but Apostle Paul gives us a picture here and
[00:24:07.540 --> 00:24:11.860]   says, "I want you to understand first a knowledge of God's will.
[00:24:11.860 --> 00:24:15.540]   You as Christians should be experts in this arena.
[00:24:15.540 --> 00:24:18.380]   What does the Lord desire?"
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.580]   We're talking about expectations of God today.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:25.540]   You as Christians should be experts in answering the question, "What is God pleased by?
[00:24:25.540 --> 00:24:27.460]   What has he been planning to do?
[00:24:27.460 --> 00:24:30.460]   What does he want for you?"
[00:24:30.460 --> 00:24:32.460]   These are questions you should be grappling with.
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:33.460]   I don't fault you.
[00:24:33.460 --> 00:24:38.460]   If you're young and you haven't had the opportunities to wrestle with your heart and wonder, "Is
[00:24:38.460 --> 00:24:42.420]   what I want in God's will?" and you wrestle with that, I don't fault you for that.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.940]   You need time to do that.
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:49.280]   But we should be striving to know first and foremost, "What is displeasing to my God?
[00:24:49.280 --> 00:24:51.200]   What is honoring to him?
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:53.780]   What does he want me to be?"
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:57.300]   Those passages of the scriptures where God says, "My will for you is that you should
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:25:02.940]   be sanctified, you should be holy, that you reflect Christ," all of these things, you
[00:25:02.940 --> 00:25:03.940]   should know.
[00:25:03.940 --> 00:25:07.100]   You should know it like the back of your hand.
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   You should.
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:11.660]   But what's more, he says, "There should be then spiritual wisdom."
[00:25:11.660 --> 00:25:14.660]   Now the Hebrew definition of spiritual wisdom, it's big.
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:16.560]   It's a big gloss.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:23.380]   But the most predominant one, the one that happens most, is the idea of skillful wisdom.
[00:25:23.380 --> 00:25:29.700]   An individual who, because of their craft and trade, knows how to accomplish their work
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:32.580]   in an incredibly efficient and wise way.
[00:25:32.580 --> 00:25:36.700]   Likewise, in the book of Exodus, it talks about these skilled craftsmen who helped build
[00:25:36.700 --> 00:25:37.860]   the tabernacle, right?
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:39.820]   It called them wise workers.
[00:25:39.820 --> 00:25:40.820]   Why?
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:42.500]   Because they have a skill.
[00:25:42.500 --> 00:25:47.700]   You should have a skill in navigating your spiritual life, right?
[00:25:47.700 --> 00:25:51.300]   It may be a corollary, it's like, "You should have the street smarts when it comes to your
[00:25:51.300 --> 00:25:52.760]   spiritual life.
[00:25:52.760 --> 00:25:54.800]   You should understand how things operate.
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.780]   You should understand how things are normative with God.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.740]   You should understand these things."
[00:25:59.740 --> 00:26:03.340]   And then what's more, it talks about understanding.
[00:26:03.340 --> 00:26:07.760]   And in this, there should be an ability for you to interpret truth.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:13.160]   It is one thing to know facts, it is another to skillfully use it, it's another to interpret.
[00:26:13.160 --> 00:26:15.540]   You should be the scientist of Christianity.
[00:26:15.540 --> 00:26:18.660]   You should be the one saying, "Oh, look at that observation.
[00:26:18.660 --> 00:26:20.940]   Oh, test my hypothesis."
[00:26:20.940 --> 00:26:25.980]   You should be the scientist examining the faith.
[00:26:25.980 --> 00:26:27.940]   And that's my challenge to you.
[00:26:27.940 --> 00:26:33.380]   This is God's desire that we be rich in Him and in all speech and in all knowledge we
[00:26:33.380 --> 00:26:35.100]   would grow.
[00:26:35.100 --> 00:26:39.140]   And God says as a warning to every single one of us that throughout history, throughout
[00:26:39.140 --> 00:26:43.620]   the past, there is pain for those who are not seeking the knowledge of God.
[00:26:43.620 --> 00:26:47.340]   For example, Proverbs chapter 19 verse 2.
[00:26:47.340 --> 00:26:50.140]   Scripture says it is not good for a person to be without knowledge.
[00:26:50.140 --> 00:26:55.660]   Hosea 4, 6, "My people are destroyed for a lack of knowledge."
[00:26:55.660 --> 00:27:01.180]   Now just by way of a practical application of this, I feel like in our day for some odd
[00:27:01.180 --> 00:27:05.700]   reason, well, I kind of know why, it's been almost noble to be like, "Yeah, I'm not a
[00:27:05.700 --> 00:27:07.780]   theologian or anything."
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:12.860]   It's also become noble to say, "You know, for me, I don't get involved in politics.
[00:27:12.860 --> 00:27:15.140]   You know, for me, I don't get involved in policy stuff.
[00:27:15.140 --> 00:27:16.900]   I don't get involved with that."
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.820]   Because there's almost something noble about being your average, run-of-the-day Christian
[00:27:20.820 --> 00:27:23.780]   and you don't have pride and arrogance like those people.
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.780]   Right?
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:27.860]   Like that has become something of a norm these days.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:29.900]   But let me make a challenge to us.
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.660]   In our day, it's not not talking about politics that we need.
[00:27:34.660 --> 00:27:35.660]   Okay?
[00:27:35.660 --> 00:27:36.740]   Let me rephrase that.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:40.460]   We don't need Christians to get out of politics.
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:41.460]   You know what we need?
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.700]   We need Christians with self-control.
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:46.760]   We need Christians who are driven by knowledge of truth.
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.940]   We need Christians who are driven by the character of God because they understand His will.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:55.780]   We need individuals who are actually more in tune with truth, more in tune with knowledge,
[00:27:55.780 --> 00:27:57.700]   and more in tune with honesty.
[00:27:57.700 --> 00:28:01.060]   That if they don't know about a topic, then they should be willing to say, "I just don't
[00:28:01.060 --> 00:28:02.060]   know yet."
[00:28:02.060 --> 00:28:03.060]   Right?
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:06.420]   But the fact of the matter is, it is not a noble thing, neither is it a cool thing for
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:09.620]   you to say, "Well, I don't get involved with that stuff."
[00:28:09.620 --> 00:28:11.340]   To me, that's cowardice.
[00:28:11.340 --> 00:28:16.140]   It is actually the exercise of the great muscle of your brain and your heart to grapple with
[00:28:16.140 --> 00:28:18.580]   issues because it grapples with value.
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:22.380]   It grapples with how you practice your life.
[00:28:22.380 --> 00:28:25.620]   And so we as Christians, we are actually all the more challenged.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:28.580]   There should be a fullness of knowledge in your life.
[00:28:28.580 --> 00:28:31.660]   To claim ignorance is neither cool or noble.
[00:28:31.660 --> 00:28:32.660]   Amen?
[00:28:32.660 --> 00:28:37.740]   Now, Scripture says that knowledge helps put everything into motion.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:38.740]   Okay?
[00:28:38.740 --> 00:28:40.540]   Knowledge helps put everything into motion.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:46.060]   Therefore, knowledge, when you understand God, when you understand His spiritual realms,
[00:28:46.060 --> 00:28:49.180]   you are going to have an established value system.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.980]   When you have a value system, now you have your priorities, right?
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:54.020]   What's important to you.
[00:28:54.020 --> 00:28:57.700]   Now you have your policies, the methodologies, and then you have your execution, what you
[00:28:57.700 --> 00:28:59.540]   actually practice.
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.660]   Your knowledge is going to affect all of that.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:05.820]   And therefore, our next challenge is raise the bar in every good work.
[00:29:05.820 --> 00:29:06.820]   Okay?
[00:29:06.820 --> 00:29:10.420]   Next challenge to you is raise the bar in every good work.
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.940]   Let's turn our eyes to Colossians chapter 1, verse 10, and let's take a look at this
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:15.500]   passage one more time.
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:16.900]   And this is what it says.
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:22.740]   So that you will walk in a manner worthy of the Lord to please Him in all respects, bearing
[00:29:22.740 --> 00:29:25.820]   fruit in every good work.
[00:29:25.820 --> 00:29:28.740]   Wow, what a challenge.
[00:29:28.740 --> 00:29:35.140]   That in our life, in pattern, in what we do, we should always be evaluating, is this pleasing
[00:29:35.140 --> 00:29:36.140]   to God?
[00:29:36.140 --> 00:29:40.700]   What's more, His expectation is that you would be bearing fruit in every single work that
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:41.740]   you engage in.
[00:29:41.740 --> 00:29:43.100]   This is so hard.
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:49.780]   I mean, if you're honest, God is challenging us to raise the bar on everything.
[00:29:49.780 --> 00:29:54.860]   He is asking you, do not have a compartmentalized life where in your workplace, because you
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:58.740]   think you're doing some monotonous, again, regardless of whatever kind of job you have,
[00:29:58.740 --> 00:30:04.060]   whether it be blue collar, white collar, whatever color collar you wear, that's hard to say.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:07.860]   Whatever colored collar you wear, okay?
[00:30:07.860 --> 00:30:09.180]   Doesn't matter.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:11.560]   God says you work heartily for the Lord.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:13.380]   God says you bear fruit in that.
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.380]   It applies to every single thing we do.
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:19.820]   Sometimes because sometimes the things that we engage in doesn't have a direct effect
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:20.820]   on us.
[00:30:20.820 --> 00:30:22.300]   It's not mine, right?
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:24.380]   Sometimes the stuff that we get engaged in is just monotonous.
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:25.380]   It's so repetitive.
[00:30:25.380 --> 00:30:26.460]   It's just always done.
[00:30:26.460 --> 00:30:33.120]   We have the tendency to lower the standard, and God says, "No, you bring the fruitfulness
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.700]   to everything you do."
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:39.460]   Here's an interesting passage that I want us to think about.
[00:30:39.460 --> 00:30:44.660]   In this book, Colossians chapter 3, turn there.
[00:30:44.660 --> 00:30:50.440]   Colossians chapter 3, verse 22, Apostle Paul challenges a group of people.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:56.340]   They actually have a very unique colored collar.
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:02.100]   He says this, "Slaves, slaves in all things obey those who are your masters on earth,
[00:31:02.100 --> 00:31:07.460]   not with external service as those who merely please men, but with sincerity of heart fearing
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:08.740]   the Lord.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:12.340]   Whatever you do, do your work heartily as for the Lord rather than for men, knowing
[00:31:12.340 --> 00:31:16.220]   that from the Lord you will receive the reward of the inheritance.
[00:31:16.220 --> 00:31:21.020]   It is the Lord Christ whom you serve, for he who does wrong will receive the consequences
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:24.220]   of the wrong which he has done, and that without partiality."
[00:31:24.220 --> 00:31:26.380]   Do you see what he's saying?
[00:31:26.380 --> 00:31:30.340]   Do you see who he's speaking to?
[00:31:30.340 --> 00:31:32.460]   This is wild.
[00:31:32.460 --> 00:31:36.100]   And non-Christians out there looking at this passage, it's like, "How dare you?
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:37.580]   The Bible condones slavery."
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:40.380]   No, it does not.
[00:31:40.380 --> 00:31:41.860]   What is it condoning?
[00:31:41.860 --> 00:31:44.620]   It's condoning godliness in your labor.
[00:31:44.620 --> 00:31:46.540]   It's condoning fruitfulness.
[00:31:46.540 --> 00:31:50.540]   It's condoning Christ-like character in everything you do.
[00:31:50.540 --> 00:31:55.380]   That more above, like so far in importance above simply the kind of work you do or the
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:01.740]   position that you hold is your godliness of character in the work that you perform.
[00:32:01.740 --> 00:32:08.020]   That in every good work, God expects you, how many aspects, all aspects to walk in a
[00:32:08.020 --> 00:32:10.900]   matter and a pattern worthy of the Lord.
[00:32:10.900 --> 00:32:12.740]   What a challenge.
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.740]   What a challenge.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.740]   And as we think about this, this could become incredibly discouraging, right?
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:21.180]   It's like, "My gosh," you know?
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:25.300]   It means everything, everything that we do, God is expecting us to be fruitful.
[00:32:25.300 --> 00:32:28.380]   Now I want to speak to this a little bit because I do believe it's difficult.
[00:32:28.380 --> 00:32:34.860]   We live in a generation where I think people across the board have a susceptibility to
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.460]   be discouraged, right?
[00:32:37.460 --> 00:32:41.380]   And I see a regular pattern nowadays where I talk to young individuals who are working
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.380]   and if they have the capacity, sometimes they look at their jobs and then they quit because
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:46.020]   they're very discouraged.
[00:32:46.020 --> 00:32:47.580]   They find no fulfillment in it.
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:49.620]   They don't find a sense of purpose.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.780]   They don't find a sense of meaning, right?
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:54.540]   And that is a discouraging thing.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:57.220]   What's more, sometimes they look at their work and it's just too big.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:02.260]   You feel like a wee little tiny man who's walked up to this gigantic fortress and it
[00:33:02.260 --> 00:33:07.380]   almost feels like you're just being expected to take over this massive, massive fortress.
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:08.380]   That's how it feels sometimes.
[00:33:08.380 --> 00:33:12.460]   Well, again, I want to give you that encouragement.
[00:33:12.460 --> 00:33:17.980]   We're not trying to find that fulfillment or the power to overcome that fortress in
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:20.180]   the work itself.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:25.580]   If you are looking at your work, waiting for it to fulfill you, you have it backwards.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:32.940]   God is trying to convince us of the power, the supply, the resource, and you bring the
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:35.580]   fruitfulness, right?
[00:33:35.580 --> 00:33:39.020]   It is both you and God.
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:43.700]   We understand from Scripture when Apostle Paul says, "Listen, some of us, we workers
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:50.060]   in the field as Christian laborers, we plant and then I come in water and then it grows.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:51.380]   Praise be to God because why?
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:52.460]   God causes the growth.
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:33:54.360]   He brings fruit.
[00:33:54.360 --> 00:33:57.940]   And then he looks to you and he says, "Bear fruit.
[00:33:57.940 --> 00:33:59.220]   Walk like you mean it.
[00:33:59.220 --> 00:34:00.700]   Walk like you believe."
[00:34:00.700 --> 00:34:05.500]   The two of those together is absolutely important for our lesson today.
[00:34:05.500 --> 00:34:12.340]   There is a massive call for us and God says to us today, "I want you to strive for this,
[00:34:12.340 --> 00:34:17.080]   not looking at your deficiency and getting discouraged, but having faith in God.
[00:34:17.080 --> 00:34:20.300]   He has already given us the power."
[00:34:20.300 --> 00:34:25.560]   And that leads us to point three, raise the bar in all power.
[00:34:25.560 --> 00:34:29.780]   Raise the bar in all power and let me explain to you what I mean by this.
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:35.000]   He says, right, "Increasing in the knowledge of God, strengthen with all power," this is
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.200]   verse 10b and 11, "strengthen with all power according to his glorious might for the attaining
[00:34:40.200 --> 00:34:46.920]   of all steadfastness, patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father."
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:49.200]   I want you to take a moment to think about that.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:55.840]   God says, "I want you to be filled with knowledge and therefore I want you to be full in every
[00:34:55.840 --> 00:34:59.880]   good work in all respects," right, pleasing the Lord.
[00:34:59.880 --> 00:35:04.520]   But I want you to also be filled with the resources of God, to be filled with the power
[00:35:04.520 --> 00:35:08.480]   of the Lord, not according to the power of this world, but according to the glorious
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:10.040]   might of God.
[00:35:10.040 --> 00:35:16.200]   Now, in order to encourage you and really make this more tangible, let's think about
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:17.600]   this a little bit.
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:24.720]   At the beginning of the sermon, I said a certain important phrase, which was, "For our standards
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:33.360]   that we live by, sometimes our standards are in accordance to mankind," meaning it is acceptable
[00:35:33.360 --> 00:35:35.960]   to the people around us.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:40.880]   We should be living by the standards that are acceptable to God, but we are regularly
[00:35:40.880 --> 00:35:46.000]   tempted to accept and adopt the standards that are acceptable to man.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:52.320]   In order for it to be acceptable to even you or to me, we exercise a rationale, okay?
[00:35:52.320 --> 00:35:54.480]   So I want you to think about it this way.
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:56.400]   Now, I'm making two comparisons here.
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:58.720]   There is a standard of man and a standard of God.
[00:35:58.720 --> 00:36:03.480]   Therefore there is also a rationale of man and a rationale of God.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:08.000]   Therefore there is also a power of man and a power of God.
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.800]   Let me explain that even further.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:14.200]   Let's take an individual who is operating by the power of man.
[00:36:14.200 --> 00:36:20.280]   Listen to his rationale about his work, about who he is, about his attitude.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:25.240]   He has standards and expectations that he operates by, and he has an explanation for
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:26.240]   you.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:27.240]   Take, for example, an individual.
[00:36:27.240 --> 00:36:31.520]   If he says, "Man, I've got this pattern where I isolate myself all the time.
[00:36:31.520 --> 00:36:34.120]   I go into hiding and I don't want to be around people."
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:36.440]   Do you know why?
[00:36:36.440 --> 00:36:38.400]   Because my family was volatile.
[00:36:38.400 --> 00:36:41.040]   And every time I opened up and shared, they just squashed me.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:42.880]   They yelled at me.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:45.000]   So sad.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:48.040]   According to human wisdom, that makes sense.
[00:36:48.040 --> 00:36:50.440]   I could see why you'd go run away.
[00:36:50.440 --> 00:36:52.720]   Imagine if I'm a person who is suspicious of everybody.
[00:36:52.720 --> 00:36:54.240]   I give you that kind of side eye.
[00:36:54.240 --> 00:36:55.840]   What are you doing?
[00:36:55.840 --> 00:36:58.600]   I'm very hard to trust individuals.
[00:36:58.600 --> 00:37:02.960]   It is very difficult to me to open up to you, and I just don't trust you.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   Why?
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:05.440]   Because I've been duped before.
[00:37:05.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   Because I got hurt before.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:09.080]   It makes sense.
[00:37:09.080 --> 00:37:10.720]   I see why you would do that.
[00:37:10.720 --> 00:37:14.560]   Can you imagine if I have a wall of preservation where I'm always defending myself, and you
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   ask why?
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:18.200]   And I say, "Because I've always had to fend for myself.
[00:37:18.200 --> 00:37:21.480]   I grew up in a broken family and nobody actually fended for me.
[00:37:21.480 --> 00:37:23.480]   I felt like I was by myself.
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:24.480]   I have this wall."
[00:37:24.480 --> 00:37:25.480]   I see.
[00:37:25.480 --> 00:37:26.480]   It makes sense.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:27.480]   The rationale is there.
[00:37:27.480 --> 00:37:33.680]   What if I'm a hoarder and I'm just greedy, and every time I get a chance, I just grab
[00:37:33.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   onto things?
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:35.680]   And you say, "Why are you doing that?"
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.200]   I say, "Because I was always deprived when I was growing up.
[00:37:39.200 --> 00:37:40.920]   I never had anything.
[00:37:40.920 --> 00:37:43.200]   My little brother, spoiled, got everything.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.640]   I was always expected to give."
[00:37:44.640 --> 00:37:45.640]   Okay.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:48.600]   It makes sense.
[00:37:48.600 --> 00:37:51.840]   Do you see how that individual has a standard?
[00:37:51.840 --> 00:37:56.540]   That individual has a rationale, but that individual also has a power.
[00:37:56.540 --> 00:37:58.720]   That person has powerlessness.
[00:37:58.720 --> 00:38:03.240]   And I'm willing to bet he believes that if he had a better family, if he had better friends,
[00:38:03.240 --> 00:38:06.800]   if he had better protection and money, he would believe he was in power.
[00:38:06.800 --> 00:38:07.800]   Dead wrong.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:08.800]   Right?
[00:38:08.800 --> 00:38:15.320]   But God is telling you, "You have been qualified by me.
[00:38:15.320 --> 00:38:19.160]   I have given you the spirit and the power of Christ in you.
[00:38:19.160 --> 00:38:23.640]   And I want you to operate not by the rationale of man when he says, 'I want you to walk in
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.960]   a manner worthy of Christ,' it is in accordance to what God has given you.
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:32.080]   It is congruent to what God has empowered in you."
[00:38:32.080 --> 00:38:36.280]   And he says, "I want you to have this in full."
[00:38:36.280 --> 00:38:39.200]   That is Apostle Paul's prayer.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.000]   That's what we have to strive for.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:48.880]   God desires us not to walk by the power of our own might, but by the power of Christ.
[00:38:48.880 --> 00:38:54.120]   And this will produce in us an incredible steadfastness, an incredible patience that
[00:38:54.120 --> 00:38:56.360]   doesn't make sense to the world.
[00:38:56.360 --> 00:38:57.480]   Why?
[00:38:57.480 --> 00:39:03.760]   This guy whom it would make so much sense to be angry, bitter, and distraught is walking
[00:39:03.760 --> 00:39:09.200]   with joy, walking with hope and great love.
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:12.080]   God wants you to be full of that kind of power.
[00:39:12.080 --> 00:39:13.080]   Amen?
[00:39:13.080 --> 00:39:17.680]   Now, we want to move to the final and last exhortation, which is raise the bar to full
[00:39:17.680 --> 00:39:19.680]   joy.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:22.120]   Raise the bar to full joy.
[00:39:22.120 --> 00:39:30.240]   And he says that in this passage, as we take a look at the final verses, verse 11 and 12
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:34.800]   he says, "Strengthen with all power according to His glorious might for the attaining of
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:40.040]   all steadfastness and all patience, joyously giving thanks to the Father who has qualified
[00:39:40.040 --> 00:39:45.760]   us to share in inheritance of the saints in light."
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:50.700]   And here he says there should be a kind of joy in you, a thanksgiving to the Father as
[00:39:50.700 --> 00:39:56.600]   you look forward to the inheritance of the people of light, the children of light.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:00.760]   And if you read it a certain way, it's almost kind of like if I put it into the context
[00:40:00.760 --> 00:40:02.640]   of expectation, right?
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:07.120]   If the Father told you, "Hey, I want you to do this now," and you're just like, "That's
[00:40:07.120 --> 00:40:08.120]   right, I should do it.
[00:40:08.120 --> 00:40:11.040]   You know, before I thought I was doing okay, but I should do it, you know?
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:12.820]   And I want you to do it right.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:13.820]   Everything you do, do it right."
[00:40:13.820 --> 00:40:15.480]   Like, "Okay, yeah, and I want you to do it with power."
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:16.480]   It's like, "Okay."
[00:40:16.480 --> 00:40:18.760]   And then you find yourself having that little bit of attitude.
[00:40:18.760 --> 00:40:19.760]   It's like, "Okay, fine, I'll do it."
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:22.080]   And he's like, "Oh, wait, wait.
[00:40:22.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   Do it with the right attitude.
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:24.080]   Smile."
[00:40:24.080 --> 00:40:25.080]   Right?
[00:40:25.080 --> 00:40:27.880]   So if you can imagine a scenario where the parent is scolding a child, like, "Go clean
[00:40:27.880 --> 00:40:28.880]   your room."
[00:40:28.880 --> 00:40:29.880]   And the child says, "Fine, I'll do it."
[00:40:29.880 --> 00:40:30.880]   And he walks away.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:31.880]   It's like, "Nuh-uh.
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:32.880]   Get back here."
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:33.880]   Right?
[00:40:33.880 --> 00:40:34.880]   You're like, "What?"
[00:40:34.880 --> 00:40:35.880]   "Change your attitude."
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:36.880]   Right?
[00:40:36.880 --> 00:40:38.920]   Like, that's kind of how I initially read the passage.
[00:40:38.920 --> 00:40:44.040]   Like, "Oh, gosh, there's this incredible high standard of God that we're supposed to strive
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:46.160]   for, the perfect standard of God.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:49.880]   Not only does He want us to do it, but He expects us to do it with joy."
[00:40:49.880 --> 00:40:52.880]   "Oh, come on, you know?"
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:55.200]   The fact of the matter is it's absolutely appropriate.
[00:40:55.200 --> 00:40:59.720]   And in order to illustrate the fact, I want to use a popular TV show.
[00:40:59.720 --> 00:41:00.720]   It's actually been discontinued.
[00:41:00.720 --> 00:41:02.520]   Many of you guys know it.
[00:41:02.520 --> 00:41:03.520]   It's called Kitchen Nightmares.
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:05.680]   How many of you guys know that?
[00:41:05.680 --> 00:41:06.680]   You giggled already?
[00:41:06.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   Good.
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:09.160]   Yeah, it looks like enough of you.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.360]   So you will get the analogy.
[00:41:11.360 --> 00:41:15.840]   Now, I love this because there's a chef named Gordon Ramsay who is, again, a celebrity now
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.200]   and has been for a long time.
[00:41:18.200 --> 00:41:22.920]   And he walks into these established restaurants who, over a long period of time, maybe they
[00:41:22.920 --> 00:41:27.000]   were like super popular a long time ago, but over a long period of time, they started to
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:28.880]   lower their standards.
[00:41:28.880 --> 00:41:31.000]   They started to have moldy food.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:32.200]   The food came out slow.
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:35.320]   Their service was horrible.
[00:41:35.320 --> 00:41:39.360]   The atmosphere was dingy.
[00:41:39.360 --> 00:41:41.360]   And then he jumps into that scenario.
[00:41:41.360 --> 00:41:43.000]   He breaks some egos.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.440]   He points out and calls them out for their low standards.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:51.960]   And then he motivates them to do more, brings them back up to the codes of your food and
[00:41:51.960 --> 00:41:55.560]   health department, and then inspires them to do more in their culinary arts.
[00:41:55.560 --> 00:41:56.560]   That's what he does.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:41:57.560]   It's awesome.
[00:41:57.560 --> 00:42:00.880]   But you guys know why I don't show you a clip of it because there's way too much cursing.
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:04.040]   It's just way too much cursing.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   But the whole premise of the whole story of him trying to get people with low standards
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:09.960]   to have high standards, I love it.
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   It's awesome.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   So there is this one scenario.
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:13.120]   I'm just going to describe it to you.
[00:42:13.120 --> 00:42:15.040]   He's at this restaurant.
[00:42:15.040 --> 00:42:18.160]   And he does this thing where he's like, "All right, that's it.
[00:42:18.160 --> 00:42:19.160]   Everybody get out of here."
[00:42:19.160 --> 00:42:20.600]   And he pulls them in.
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:22.560]   Just imagine I'm doing this with an English accent.
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:23.560]   "Come on, lads.
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:24.560]   Come on over."
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.000]   And then he brings everybody in, the chef, the sous chef, and the salsasters, and the
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:30.600]   owner, gets them in a fat circle.
[00:42:30.600 --> 00:42:32.560]   And he brings this little bucket out.
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:33.560]   He puts it on the table.
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   He's like, "What is this?
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:35.560]   What is this?"
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:36.560]   He's all mad.
[00:42:36.560 --> 00:42:37.560]   He's enraged.
[00:42:37.560 --> 00:42:38.560]   And everyone's like, "What?
[00:42:38.560 --> 00:42:39.560]   What?
[00:42:39.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   What?"
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:41.720]   And he's like, "Look at this mashed potato.
[00:42:41.720 --> 00:42:43.080]   It's made of power.
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   And there's mold."
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:45.080]   And they're like, "Oh, my gosh.
[00:42:45.080 --> 00:42:46.080]   There's mold."
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:47.080]   Right?
[00:42:47.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   And they're all distraught.
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:52.720]   And the chef is just standing there with his arm crossed because he knows what's coming.
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:53.720]   Right?
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:55.240]   So the chef looks like, "What is this?"
[00:42:55.240 --> 00:42:56.240]   And the guy's like, "What?
[00:42:56.240 --> 00:42:57.240]   No one's complaining.
[00:42:57.240 --> 00:42:58.840]   Nobody complained tonight."
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.720]   And the chef's like, "What?
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:02.400]   Hey, man.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.480]   Why did you even become a chef?"
[00:43:04.480 --> 00:43:05.880]   And the guy's like, "Because I love food.
[00:43:05.880 --> 00:43:08.280]   I have a passion for food."
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:12.320]   And the chef going around, he's like, "You have no passion for food.
[00:43:12.320 --> 00:43:14.240]   You don't even have passion for these people.
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.160]   You have no respect for this industry.
[00:43:16.160 --> 00:43:17.160]   You are nothing."
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   Right?
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   And I'm like, "Oh, what a gangster."
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:20.160]   You know?
[00:43:20.160 --> 00:43:24.360]   Like, he's just calling out that man and just demolishing him like this, you know?
[00:43:24.360 --> 00:43:28.480]   And then, you know, they have a pan out to one of the hostesses or one of the servers,
[00:43:28.480 --> 00:43:29.480]   and he's like, "He's right."
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:30.480]   You know?
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.360]   He's just like...
[00:43:32.360 --> 00:43:33.360]   It's so funny.
[00:43:33.360 --> 00:43:36.520]   It's so funny.
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.720]   But you guys know exactly where I'm going with this analogy.
[00:43:39.720 --> 00:43:40.880]   Right?
[00:43:40.880 --> 00:43:46.360]   We're talking about not only doing the right things, but we're also talking about the kind
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.560]   of joy and passion that God wants us to have.
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:53.040]   Now the analogy is so good, it just operates by itself, and I don't even have to talk about
[00:43:53.040 --> 00:43:57.160]   it that much, but there should be a level of distance between the analogy of Chef Gordon
[00:43:57.160 --> 00:44:03.320]   Ramsay versus the analogy of our love for Christ and what we're doing in terms of setting
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:05.160]   the bar for our Christian faith.
[00:44:05.160 --> 00:44:06.160]   Right?
[00:44:06.160 --> 00:44:10.320]   Because what Apostle Paul is saying is not, "Do it right.
[00:44:10.320 --> 00:44:11.320]   Make those potatoes."
[00:44:11.320 --> 00:44:13.360]   Right?
[00:44:13.360 --> 00:44:16.320]   We're talking about an individual who has anger, right?
[00:44:16.320 --> 00:44:21.320]   Gordon Ramsay has anger, indignation, and a sense of, "What is this?"
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:24.240]   Because the food is not up to par.
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.040]   And that is an incredible convicting challenge for me because we're talking about the gospel,
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.520]   we're talking about our faith in God, we're talking about eternity.
[00:44:32.520 --> 00:44:36.000]   Apostle Paul is saying, "You have been qualified.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:42.440]   You have been qualified for this inheritance, everlasting, permanent, unstained by anything.
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:47.240]   This is a great treasure that you have been given.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:51.080]   Shouldn't you at least have the same kind of indignation and passion?
[00:44:51.080 --> 00:44:56.320]   Shouldn't we also, and likewise the other side, have the same kind of joy and gusto?"
[00:44:56.320 --> 00:44:58.520]   Apostle Paul is not saying, "Do it.
[00:44:58.520 --> 00:44:59.520]   Just do it right.
[00:44:59.520 --> 00:45:00.520]   Cook it right."
[00:45:00.520 --> 00:45:01.520]   No.
[00:45:01.520 --> 00:45:07.320]   "Do not be full in everything in all respect, be full in every good work, but have joy in
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:13.280]   thanksgiving because that is appropriate for Christians who are calling upon the name of
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:14.280]   the Lord.
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:18.360]   We are not simply raising the bar, gritting your teeth, and trying to do it.
[00:45:18.360 --> 00:45:20.320]   We're actually trying to exercise our faith.
[00:45:20.320 --> 00:45:23.360]   God, I believe in you."
[00:45:23.360 --> 00:45:25.520]   Likewise for us then.
[00:45:25.520 --> 00:45:27.280]   What a challenge, right?
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:29.880]   Personally for me, what a challenge, right?
[00:45:29.880 --> 00:45:33.480]   Like there's, man, I just got to share it just honestly.
[00:45:33.480 --> 00:45:38.200]   Like as I studied this passage, I kind of thought about, "Godness, God, what you're
[00:45:38.200 --> 00:45:43.560]   doing right here, Lord, you're saying to me nothing short of 100% surrender is okay for
[00:45:43.560 --> 00:45:44.560]   you."
[00:45:44.560 --> 00:45:45.560]   Right?
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:50.960]   God, as I was meditating on this passage, I'm sitting here thinking, "God, every moment
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:55.800]   when I started feeling less, right, and I got all discouraged, and I threw a little
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.800]   pity party."
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.560]   "But I'm working as hard as I can."
[00:45:58.560 --> 00:46:03.760]   You know, like these are the moments when I could exercise my faith in you, to have
[00:46:03.760 --> 00:46:08.520]   great joy and know that what you have started in me, you're going to complete.
[00:46:08.520 --> 00:46:11.880]   And right now, my vision is not this.
[00:46:11.880 --> 00:46:14.520]   I am not just okay.
[00:46:14.520 --> 00:46:17.200]   May it never be that I say that.
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:19.840]   I'm being transformed by Christ.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.280]   And in moments when people point the finger and say, "But what are you doing?"
[00:46:22.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   I'm not going to get all defensive.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.800]   I'm going to say, "Thank you for asking."
[00:46:26.800 --> 00:46:31.440]   Because I cannot just simply year to year do and repeat everything I'm doing just because
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:33.120]   I've done it before.
[00:46:33.120 --> 00:46:37.960]   I have to intentionally think, "How am I trying to attain and strive for the perfect measure
[00:46:37.960 --> 00:46:40.160]   of Christ?"
[00:46:40.160 --> 00:46:46.240]   And there is no single element of my life that is not open to that kind of scrutiny.
[00:46:46.240 --> 00:46:52.040]   Whether it be my service, my home life, whether it be my own relationships, my thoughts, everything
[00:46:52.040 --> 00:46:54.360]   is open to you, Lord.
[00:46:54.360 --> 00:47:00.320]   And I pray that you would be challenged today, that there would be that kind of, I guess,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:02.360]   godly discontent in you.
[00:47:02.360 --> 00:47:04.120]   This is not currently my vision.
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.360]   My vision is for more.
[00:47:06.360 --> 00:47:11.440]   And just like Chef Ramsay could look at something, taste it, and say, "What is this?"
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.940]   For those of us who have taste of heaven, those of us who have taste of Christ, we should
[00:47:14.940 --> 00:47:19.040]   be able to look at the world, have all these people present it to us and say, "Look!
[00:47:19.040 --> 00:47:20.040]   Look how impressive!"
[00:47:20.040 --> 00:47:22.840]   We say, "What is this?
[00:47:22.840 --> 00:47:24.840]   Where are your standards, man?"
[00:47:24.840 --> 00:47:27.480]   It's utter trash.
[00:47:27.480 --> 00:47:32.040]   I have an inheritance, the people of light, that God has secured for me.
[00:47:32.040 --> 00:47:33.040]   Amen?
[00:47:33.040 --> 00:47:33.160]   Let's pray.
[00:47:33.160 --> 00:47:35.920]   (snow crunching)
