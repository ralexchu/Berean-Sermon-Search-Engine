[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000]   So, Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi, folks.
[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.240]   So, by way of introduction,
[00:00:10.240 --> 00:00:11.800]   I wanna just sort of tell the story
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:13.520]   of how this panel happened.
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:16.880]   It arose out of almost a throwaway comment
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:19.680]   that Jason made on an episode of the pod
[00:00:19.680 --> 00:00:22.160]   where he was talking about lining up speakers
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:25.880]   for this event, and he said that he was having
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:27.800]   a hard time getting liberals,
[00:00:27.800 --> 00:00:31.400]   and all he could find were right-wingers
[00:00:31.400 --> 00:00:34.600]   like Glenn Greenwald and Matt Taibbi.
[00:00:34.600 --> 00:00:38.400]   And in terms of just to explain
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:39.920]   their backgrounds a little bit,
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:43.800]   Matt used to be the, they're both independent journalists
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:46.680]   who write phenomenal columns on Substack,
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:48.400]   and all of you should check it out and subscribe.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:50.920]   And by the way, they also do call-in shows
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.840]   on a phenomenal podcasting platform
[00:00:52.840 --> 00:00:54.340]   that you should all check out.
[00:00:55.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   But Matt was sort of like the left-wing firebrand,
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.720]   sort of populist firebrand, writing for Rolling Stone,
[00:01:03.720 --> 00:01:05.920]   who back in 2009 was asking the question
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.760]   why the people who caused the great financial crisis,
[00:01:09.760 --> 00:01:11.860]   why no one was going to jail.
[00:01:11.860 --> 00:01:15.840]   And Glenn broke the Snowden story
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:17.320]   about how the government was engaging
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.480]   in mass surveillance on all of us
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:22.280]   and raising questions about the infringement
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:23.720]   of our civil liberties.
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:27.220]   So both these guys have, I'd say,
[00:01:27.220 --> 00:01:30.440]   well-established bona fides,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:34.120]   used to be considered left-wing,
[00:01:34.120 --> 00:01:35.520]   sort of liberal bona fides,
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:39.520]   but now today somehow they've been read out of
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.400]   what you would call liberalism today.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.560]   And so that comment that Jason made,
[00:01:45.560 --> 00:01:47.800]   I think there's so much to unpack there
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:49.800]   on how that happened.
[00:01:49.800 --> 00:01:52.960]   What does liberalism today mean
[00:01:52.960 --> 00:01:55.160]   if it doesn't include you guys?
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.260]   And so maybe that's the place to start,
[00:01:59.260 --> 00:02:02.880]   is trying to understand what has happened in our politics
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:05.640]   that makes you guys not liberal anymore,
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:08.600]   and what is liberalism, and then what is conservatism,
[00:02:08.600 --> 00:02:11.720]   and are we even thinking about the political divide
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:13.240]   in our country the right way
[00:02:13.240 --> 00:02:17.720]   if left versus right doesn't really capture it anymore?
[00:02:17.720 --> 00:02:22.720]   So that was sort of the starting point for this.
[00:02:22.960 --> 00:02:25.320]   Who wants to just react to anything I just said?
[00:02:25.320 --> 00:02:28.880]   - Yeah, well, first of all, it's of course very gratifying
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:31.680]   to realize that your attendance at a conference
[00:02:31.680 --> 00:02:33.760]   is due to a throwaway line from Jason.
[00:02:33.760 --> 00:02:36.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:37.920]   Super honored to hear that,
[00:02:37.920 --> 00:02:39.720]   as that's the reason why we were invited.
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:42.300]   (upbeat music)

[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.940]   I guess we join a long list of other far-right luminaries
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:05.040]   like Russell Brand, who has spent the last 15 years
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.520]   as one of the most vocal devotees
[00:03:07.520 --> 00:03:09.420]   to the socialist Jeremy Corbyn.
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:11.600]   He's now also on the right,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.300]   and Joe Rogan, who just 18 months ago
[00:03:15.300 --> 00:03:18.420]   said to millions of people that his favorite candidate
[00:03:18.420 --> 00:03:20.620]   running for president was Bernie Sanders,
[00:03:20.620 --> 00:03:24.740]   the socialist left-wing candidate from Vermont,
[00:03:24.740 --> 00:03:29.740]   and even now Elon Musk, who voted for Barack Obama in 2012
[00:03:29.740 --> 00:03:34.000]   over Mitt Romney and is one of the largest donors
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.320]   to the ACLU, somehow he's also on the far right.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:42.320]   So in some sense, it's just become a kind of punishing label
[00:03:42.320 --> 00:03:45.660]   that's designed to stigmatize or demonize anybody
[00:03:45.660 --> 00:03:47.340]   who in any way descends from
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:49.900]   or diverges from liberal orthodoxy.
[00:03:49.900 --> 00:03:52.420]   It's just kind of an enforcement or coercive label
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:56.500]   that has no meaning, just bereft of any actual substance.
[00:03:56.500 --> 00:04:00.780]   But I think there's a broader dynamic underneath it all,
[00:04:00.780 --> 00:04:05.540]   which is that, you know, it is true that every five years,
[00:04:05.540 --> 00:04:09.420]   10 years, what was once an issue at the forefront
[00:04:09.420 --> 00:04:12.720]   of our debates goes to the background
[00:04:12.720 --> 00:04:14.440]   and other issues go to the forefront.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:17.260]   So 10 years ago, we were spending a lot of time
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:19.460]   debating things like Obama's drone program
[00:04:19.460 --> 00:04:22.500]   or Guantanamo not being closed,
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:25.480]   or as you said, the work Matt was doing on, you know,
[00:04:25.480 --> 00:04:27.360]   derivatives and the fraud on Wall Street.
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:28.700]   We don't talk much about that anymore.
[00:04:28.700 --> 00:04:31.440]   We spend a lot of time now talking instead about
[00:04:31.440 --> 00:04:33.620]   whether the internet should be this instrument
[00:04:33.620 --> 00:04:36.080]   of censorship and information control,
[00:04:36.080 --> 00:04:40.280]   whether we should trust the US security state
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:44.420]   to dictate what is and is not disinformation,
[00:04:44.420 --> 00:04:47.420]   whether we should be involved in very similar kinds
[00:04:47.420 --> 00:04:51.020]   of proxy wars like we spent the Cold War doing
[00:04:51.020 --> 00:04:53.140]   over places like Ukraine.
[00:04:53.140 --> 00:04:56.220]   And so in one way, it's natural that political alliances
[00:04:56.220 --> 00:04:58.400]   shift as different issues go to the fore
[00:04:58.400 --> 00:05:00.540]   and alliances change as a result.
[00:05:00.540 --> 00:05:02.740]   But I think something much more important
[00:05:02.740 --> 00:05:05.620]   is that liberalism itself has changed largely
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:07.420]   by virtue of Donald Trump,
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.820]   because liberals as a defining view,
[00:05:10.820 --> 00:05:12.380]   maybe as an overarching view--
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:14.300]   - Maybe Democrats not liberals.
[00:05:14.300 --> 00:05:16.740]   - Yeah, by liberals, I just mean kind of the mainstream wing
[00:05:16.740 --> 00:05:17.700]   of the Democratic Party,
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.660]   the way Hillary Clinton calls herself progressive.
[00:05:20.660 --> 00:05:23.100]   So again, illustrating the bankruptcy of these terms,
[00:05:23.100 --> 00:05:25.420]   but by liberals, I just mean kind of like the Nancy Pelosi,
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:28.420]   Barack Obama, Hillary Clinton, Chuck Schumer wing,
[00:05:28.420 --> 00:05:30.800]   have come to believe that the overarching way
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:35.800]   to understand politics is that there's one primary menace
[00:05:35.800 --> 00:05:39.860]   and risk to the United States, which is Donald Trump,
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:41.940]   his movement, and the Republican Party.
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:43.940]   And it's not just that they have a bad ideology,
[00:05:43.940 --> 00:05:45.420]   but that they're actual fascists
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.680]   trying to instill a white nationalist dictatorship.
[00:05:48.680 --> 00:05:50.020]   And if you actually believe that,
[00:05:50.020 --> 00:05:52.260]   if that's something that you genuinely believe,
[00:05:52.260 --> 00:05:54.240]   on some level, it becomes rational
[00:05:54.240 --> 00:05:57.460]   to start embracing authoritarian methods
[00:05:57.460 --> 00:05:59.680]   of resisting that, of combating that,
[00:05:59.680 --> 00:06:04.680]   censoring, using due process-free processes
[00:06:04.680 --> 00:06:08.440]   to punish people and deprive them of their liberty.
[00:06:08.440 --> 00:06:12.340]   And I think any time a political movement gets convinced
[00:06:12.340 --> 00:06:14.680]   that it is no longer involved in a political debate,
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:19.300]   but a historic war between pure good and pure evil,
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:22.340]   it starts to turn to authoritarian tactics to win
[00:06:22.340 --> 00:06:25.020]   because it believes that's justified or even necessary.
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:28.180]   And those authoritarian tactics happen to be the ones
[00:06:28.180 --> 00:06:30.880]   that the left traditionally had opposed
[00:06:30.880 --> 00:06:32.140]   and now are embracing.
[00:06:32.140 --> 00:06:35.060]   And I guess Matt and I didn't decide
[00:06:35.060 --> 00:06:36.960]   that we were gonna change our views
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:39.060]   over the last 30 years about these issues,
[00:06:39.060 --> 00:06:41.940]   and that has caused this organic breach,
[00:06:41.940 --> 00:06:44.860]   not just between us two, but others like us.
[00:06:44.860 --> 00:06:46.580]   And as I said, anyone who finds themselves
[00:06:46.580 --> 00:06:48.020]   outside of liberal orthodoxy
[00:06:48.020 --> 00:06:50.240]   automatically receives the far-right label.
[00:06:50.240 --> 00:06:54.380]   - Yeah, first of all, I agree with all that.
[00:06:54.380 --> 00:06:57.380]   And for me, it's even funnier
[00:06:57.380 --> 00:07:02.100]   because prior to 2008, I would say that
[00:07:02.100 --> 00:07:06.200]   I was sort of like the triumphant insult comic dog
[00:07:06.200 --> 00:07:07.260]   of journalism.
[00:07:07.260 --> 00:07:09.940]   Basically, my job at Rolling Stone
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:13.120]   was to throw off one-liners about Republicans.
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:17.740]   My editors almost never sent me to a democratic function
[00:07:17.740 --> 00:07:22.340]   because they didn't want me describing those events
[00:07:22.340 --> 00:07:24.700]   in a colorful way, let's put it that way.
[00:07:24.700 --> 00:07:28.300]   So I got sent to a lot of events
[00:07:28.300 --> 00:07:31.420]   where people like Sarah Palin or Fred Thompson
[00:07:31.420 --> 00:07:33.420]   or Mike Huckabee would be speaking.
[00:07:33.420 --> 00:07:35.580]   I actually won a National Magazine Award
[00:07:35.580 --> 00:07:40.580]   for a column about Huckabee called "My Favorite Nut Job."
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:43.860]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:43.860 --> 00:07:48.940]   But then after 2008, after Obama got elected,
[00:07:48.940 --> 00:07:52.820]   they assigned me to do a story, one story,
[00:07:52.820 --> 00:07:56.900]   about the 2008 financial crisis,
[00:07:56.900 --> 00:07:59.700]   essentially with the idea of explaining it
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:02.660]   in terms that people who are not financial professionals
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:04.100]   could understand.
[00:08:04.100 --> 00:08:06.860]   So I did one story that was really about AIG
[00:08:06.860 --> 00:08:09.740]   and we got this overwhelming response
[00:08:09.740 --> 00:08:12.280]   that we'd never gotten before from readers
[00:08:12.280 --> 00:08:14.700]   we'd never heard from before.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:17.820]   And that led to me doing eight years of work
[00:08:17.820 --> 00:08:20.980]   instead of one story.
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:25.540]   And one of the themes that came out of that reporting
[00:08:25.540 --> 00:08:30.180]   was that in the sort of post-bailout economy,
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:32.460]   the wealth gap was widening.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:35.220]   And I just read a statistic that said
[00:08:35.220 --> 00:08:38.200]   that during the Obama years,
[00:08:38.200 --> 00:08:43.200]   the bottom 99% saw their average wealth decrease by $4,900,
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:48.040]   whereas the top 1% saw its wealth increase
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:50.820]   by an average of $4.9 million.
[00:08:50.820 --> 00:08:55.780]   And so I didn't make that big of a deal of this
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:09:00.220]   in my reporting, but when 2016 came around,
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.740]   in covering both the Trump and Sanders campaigns,
[00:09:07.740 --> 00:09:12.060]   it was abundantly clear that this widening wealth gap
[00:09:12.060 --> 00:09:16.380]   and the stress that it had placed on populations
[00:09:16.380 --> 00:09:18.460]   on both the left and the right
[00:09:18.460 --> 00:09:22.620]   was a significant factor in this race.
[00:09:22.620 --> 00:09:25.500]   And when I started to write this
[00:09:25.500 --> 00:09:27.400]   in the context of covering Trump,
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.280]   rather than just doing the usual thing
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.000]   of tossing off insults about the candidate,
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.100]   which is easy enough to do with Trump,
[00:09:35.100 --> 00:09:38.500]   I started to say things like,
[00:09:38.500 --> 00:09:40.580]   well, there are reasons why he's succeeding.
[00:09:40.580 --> 00:09:43.260]   He's attracting crowds that are not
[00:09:43.260 --> 00:09:45.260]   just the usual Republican crowds.
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:48.120]   They're former union members here.
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:50.260]   They have a lot in common with the crowds
[00:09:50.260 --> 00:09:53.020]   who show up at Bernie Sanders events.
[00:09:53.020 --> 00:09:58.020]   And I started to notice a distinctly unpleasant reaction
[00:09:58.020 --> 00:10:02.380]   from people inside the business,
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:05.340]   where it quickly became taboo to explain Donald Trump
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:10.140]   in any way other than this is a white supremacist movement
[00:10:10.140 --> 00:10:14.740]   and he's appealing to the lowest common denominator
[00:10:15.460 --> 00:10:16.620]   through that kind of messaging.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:20.060]   Now, I happen to believe that that was part of,
[00:10:20.060 --> 00:10:22.180]   certainly part of what was going on,
[00:10:22.180 --> 00:10:24.580]   but it wasn't the whole explanation.
[00:10:24.580 --> 00:10:26.940]   But I think Trump is the dividing line
[00:10:26.940 --> 00:10:28.140]   of what you're talking about.
[00:10:28.140 --> 00:10:31.120]   If you don't have,
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:34.700]   if you have a nuanced explanation for Donald Trump,
[00:10:34.700 --> 00:10:38.660]   then you can't be part of the club anymore
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:43.660]   because the dominant narrative requires
[00:10:43.940 --> 00:10:48.940]   that he be cartoonized in the same way
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.340]   that we used to do it with figures like Saddam Hussein
[00:10:51.340 --> 00:10:53.420]   or Putin now.
[00:10:53.420 --> 00:10:56.420]   You know, we call it the Hitler of the month club, right?
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:00.700]   If you're not willing to just do that,
[00:11:00.700 --> 00:11:02.660]   and if you try to actually explain
[00:11:02.660 --> 00:11:04.220]   where are all these voters coming from,
[00:11:04.220 --> 00:11:05.780]   why are they upset,
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:08.180]   what went wrong that this would happen?
[00:11:08.180 --> 00:11:09.900]   - Also known as the purpose of journalism.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:11.340]   - Yeah, exactly, right?
[00:11:11.340 --> 00:11:13.000]   Which is supposed to be our job.
[00:11:13.660 --> 00:11:16.820]   (audience applauding)
[00:11:16.820 --> 00:11:23.000]   I think both of us quickly learned
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.680]   that that was not welcome.
[00:11:25.680 --> 00:11:29.120]   And after Trump got elected,
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:33.960]   I think that instinct to crowd out anyone
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:35.520]   who was interested in going there
[00:11:35.520 --> 00:11:38.240]   and trying to figure out what was wrong
[00:11:38.240 --> 00:11:43.240]   that had caused 2016 suddenly became an apostate.
[00:11:43.240 --> 00:11:46.520]   And by the way, that includes some politicians.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:49.360]   Like Bernie Sanders, I think, was one of the people
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:52.200]   who was very interested in examining
[00:11:52.200 --> 00:11:54.640]   what happened in 2016.
[00:11:54.640 --> 00:11:57.860]   And I think that's one of the reasons
[00:11:57.860 --> 00:12:00.640]   why there was such a violent reaction
[00:12:00.640 --> 00:12:04.840]   to his candidacy in both 2016 and 2020.
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:07.840]   So for me, I think that's the dividing line.
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:11.800]   It's not like something's changed so much with liberalism.
[00:12:11.800 --> 00:12:15.640]   It's really about Trump, I think,
[00:12:15.640 --> 00:12:18.880]   and journalism has adjusted.
[00:12:18.880 --> 00:12:23.720]   We've gone from being people whose primary job
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.760]   is to be curious about why things happen
[00:12:25.760 --> 00:12:30.840]   to being advocates who believe that certain people
[00:12:30.840 --> 00:12:32.480]   have to be opposed at all costs,
[00:12:32.480 --> 00:12:36.160]   and even if that cost is a little bit of the truth,
[00:12:36.160 --> 00:12:37.240]   or a lot of it, even.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:41.440]   - So having ripped the umpire jersey off their backs
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.920]   to basically stop the Trump menace,
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:47.240]   it seems like journalism can't now go back
[00:12:47.240 --> 00:12:49.560]   to even a pretense of neutrality.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:51.960]   Is that so what basically has happened now?
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:54.560]   - I think so, and I think you see that
[00:12:54.560 --> 00:12:59.160]   in what's happening with the ratings at cable stations.
[00:12:59.160 --> 00:13:03.120]   I warned about this in 2016.
[00:13:03.120 --> 00:13:06.800]   I wrote a column that summer saying
[00:13:06.800 --> 00:13:10.480]   that a model where basically right-wing media
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:13.560]   wrote about the evils of the Democratic Party
[00:13:13.560 --> 00:13:17.000]   and blue media wrote about the evils of the Republican Party
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:20.880]   that just wouldn't work audience-wise
[00:13:20.880 --> 00:13:23.440]   because audiences would no longer trust
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:28.160]   either source to be objective and to report the facts,
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:29.800]   and I think that's where we are now.
[00:13:29.800 --> 00:13:34.800]   We see the declining ratings of companies like CNN
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.280]   and MSNBC, which were previously thought of
[00:13:40.280 --> 00:13:42.480]   as more kind of down the road,
[00:13:42.480 --> 00:13:45.160]   down the middle of the road news agencies,
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:47.040]   and now are thought of as politicized,
[00:13:47.040 --> 00:13:50.640]   and they're having terrible trouble kind of going back
[00:13:50.640 --> 00:13:53.840]   'cause once you cross that line into politics,
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:56.720]   you can't get your reputation back
[00:13:56.720 --> 00:13:58.800]   as a neutral fact-finder anymore.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.720]   - Yeah, I think people forget
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:02.720]   what things were like before Trump,
[00:14:02.720 --> 00:14:07.120]   since he's such a kind of ubiquitous presence,
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:09.200]   as Matt was saying, and for me,
[00:14:09.200 --> 00:14:11.880]   he also defines and is responsible
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.000]   for most of the changes we're discussing,
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:17.060]   but back in 2015, most of these news organizations
[00:14:17.060 --> 00:14:19.160]   were on the brink of collapse.
[00:14:19.160 --> 00:14:23.160]   Every MSNBC host was on the verge of being fired,
[00:14:23.160 --> 00:14:24.640]   a couple of months away from being fired
[00:14:24.640 --> 00:14:26.280]   because nobody was watching.
[00:14:26.280 --> 00:14:29.640]   The New York Times had severe financial difficulty.
[00:14:29.640 --> 00:14:31.000]   There was talk about whether they would have
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:33.760]   to declare bankruptcy because their balance sheet
[00:14:33.760 --> 00:14:38.760]   was so drowning in debt, and Trump saved them all.
[00:14:38.760 --> 00:14:41.020]   He saved the entire industry.
[00:14:41.020 --> 00:14:44.160]   They all owed their jobs, their second homes,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:48.880]   the ability to pay off their IRS debt to Donald Trump,
[00:14:48.880 --> 00:14:51.060]   because you can trace his emergence on the scene
[00:14:51.060 --> 00:14:53.080]   to when people started watching those programs again,
[00:14:53.080 --> 00:14:56.540]   and what they did was they rebranded
[00:14:56.540 --> 00:14:59.620]   as the resistance to Donald Trump,
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:03.160]   and they sacrificed any even pretense
[00:15:03.160 --> 00:15:04.600]   of journalistic function.
[00:15:04.600 --> 00:15:07.440]   They know, and you just look at polling data,
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:10.880]   that 95% of the people who watch MSNBC
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:13.360]   and 93% of the people who read the New York Times
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:17.040]   and trust it identify as Democrats,
[00:15:17.040 --> 00:15:19.520]   so there's a completely polarized media.
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:22.560]   One of the kind of non-media examples is the ACLU.
[00:15:22.560 --> 00:15:25.160]   There was an article in 2015 in the ACLU
[00:15:25.160 --> 00:15:27.200]   about the ACLU and the Washington Post
[00:15:27.200 --> 00:15:30.060]   that they had to engage a mass layoff
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:32.140]   of their staff because they had no money.
[00:15:32.140 --> 00:15:33.420]   Trump gets inaugurated.
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:35.180]   They start tweeting every day,
[00:15:35.180 --> 00:15:37.060]   "We'll see you in court, Mr. Trump,"
[00:15:37.060 --> 00:15:41.100]   and stimulating the kind of G-zones of every liberal,
[00:15:41.100 --> 00:15:45.100]   and suddenly they're drowning in money,
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:47.260]   like millions and millions of dollars,
[00:15:47.260 --> 00:15:50.020]   like building the ACLU.
[00:15:50.020 --> 00:15:51.680]   It's always financially struggled,
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:54.380]   and as a result, they're completely captive now
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:55.860]   to that kind of an audience.
[00:15:55.860 --> 00:15:58.300]   I have a friend, I guess I had a friend,
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:02.980]   who was a host of an MSNBC show,
[00:16:02.980 --> 00:16:05.900]   and they once told me that they don't get
[00:16:05.900 --> 00:16:09.140]   show-by-show ratings, they get segment-by-segment ratings,
[00:16:09.140 --> 00:16:12.200]   and ever since Trump, they told me
[00:16:12.200 --> 00:16:14.220]   the minute you put on anybody
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:16.180]   who's critical of the Democratic Party anyway,
[00:16:16.180 --> 00:16:18.980]   you can just see the audience completely disappear,
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:21.500]   which you can imagine a person in that position,
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.820]   what an enforcement mechanism that is
[00:16:23.820 --> 00:16:25.660]   to know that they have a salary and kids
[00:16:25.660 --> 00:16:28.500]   and the need to pay for college and their mortgage,
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:31.020]   and they know if they do anything that deviates at all
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.100]   from Democratic Party doctrine,
[00:16:33.100 --> 00:16:34.180]   they're gonna lose their audience.
[00:16:34.180 --> 00:16:37.160]   The New York Times knows that, the ACLU knows that,
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:39.240]   and so yeah, I think they're all,
[00:16:39.240 --> 00:16:40.820]   it's not just that they've lost their credibility
[00:16:40.820 --> 00:16:42.740]   and can't get it back, which is absolutely true,
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:45.380]   as Matt said, it's also that they're now captive
[00:16:45.380 --> 00:16:50.100]   to this kind of prison cell that they built for themselves,
[00:16:50.100 --> 00:16:53.100]   chasing the sugar high that Trump provided.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:55.540]   - Just really quickly, I gotta tell a story.
[00:16:55.540 --> 00:16:57.500]   In the middle of all this phenomenon,
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:16:59.940]   reporters were arguing about whether or not
[00:16:59.940 --> 00:17:01.260]   we should be covering him less,
[00:17:01.260 --> 00:17:05.460]   because maybe we had helped him get the nomination.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:09.020]   I cover Trump's campaign, and this was a hot topic
[00:17:09.020 --> 00:17:13.480]   on the bus at the time, but then it was sort of decided
[00:17:13.480 --> 00:17:15.480]   that, nah, he's just making us all so much money,
[00:17:15.480 --> 00:17:16.940]   let's just go with it.
[00:17:16.940 --> 00:17:18.820]   (audience laughing)
[00:17:18.820 --> 00:17:21.740]   I remember being in Indianapolis
[00:17:21.740 --> 00:17:26.700]   when Trump sewed up the nomination by beating Cruz,
[00:17:26.700 --> 00:17:29.620]   who still had a mathematical chance of winning, I guess,
[00:17:29.620 --> 00:17:31.080]   if he had done well there.
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.740]   But Trump, if you remember, during that particular race,
[00:17:34.740 --> 00:17:38.180]   accused Cruz of being the Zodiac killer,
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:43.560]   which was hilarious, because Cruz was born
[00:17:43.560 --> 00:17:45.980]   two years after the killing ended,
[00:17:45.980 --> 00:17:48.700]   so, but there was one reporter I know
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:52.660]   who actually got the nerve up to ask,
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.660]   I believe it was Cruz's wife, about the accusations.
[00:17:57.660 --> 00:18:00.860]   Like, what do you have to say to the idea
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.860]   that your husband is the Zodiac killer?
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:09.020]   And he's telling me the story about this afterwards,
[00:18:09.020 --> 00:18:11.700]   and he goes, you know, I felt so dirty doing it,
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:13.640]   but I also felt so great.
[00:18:13.640 --> 00:18:15.020]   (audience laughing)
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:17.860]   So, I think that's where they were.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:20.420]   They were in that space for a long time.
[00:18:20.420 --> 00:18:22.260]   - The media and Trump had a weird
[00:18:22.260 --> 00:18:24.220]   codependent relationship. - Totally.
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:28.020]   - Just in terms of trying to appeal to people out there
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:30.220]   who may not be Trump fans,
[00:18:30.220 --> 00:18:32.660]   or to get through to them on this point,
[00:18:32.660 --> 00:18:35.220]   it just seems to me that when you lose an election,
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.740]   any time you lose an election as a party,
[00:18:37.740 --> 00:18:39.820]   you need to analyze what went wrong,
[00:18:39.820 --> 00:18:43.000]   and especially when the candidate
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:47.500]   is a complete political novice with no prior experience
[00:18:47.500 --> 00:18:50.500]   and had so many attributes that historically
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.960]   were considered extreme negatives.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:55.560]   And it seems to me that if you were just to look
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:18:57.740]   at what happened in 2016,
[00:18:57.740 --> 00:19:00.280]   Trump was able to ride a few key issues
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:01.620]   all the way to the White House.
[00:19:01.620 --> 00:19:04.820]   One was these foreign wars,
[00:19:04.820 --> 00:19:07.180]   these interventions that we've had in Afghanistan,
[00:19:07.180 --> 00:19:09.960]   Iraq, Syria, Libya, that were disasters.
[00:19:09.960 --> 00:19:11.940]   We hadn't gotten out of Afghanistan yet,
[00:19:11.940 --> 00:19:15.620]   but it was on its way to being a historic 20-year failure.
[00:19:15.620 --> 00:19:18.140]   He shattered the Republican Party with that message,
[00:19:18.140 --> 00:19:19.540]   no more Bushes.
[00:19:19.540 --> 00:19:23.140]   He then took the issue of trade
[00:19:23.140 --> 00:19:26.700]   and basically broke down the Democrats' blue wall
[00:19:26.700 --> 00:19:29.340]   and the Rust Belt by basically pointing out the ways
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:31.920]   that our bipartisan trade policy,
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:36.860]   just like our bipartisan foreign war policy,
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:41.860]   had led to the deindustrialization of the Rust Belt.
[00:19:42.500 --> 00:19:45.780]   And then he also used the issue of immigration,
[00:19:45.780 --> 00:19:47.740]   which was sort of closely related to that idea
[00:19:47.740 --> 00:19:50.140]   of creating wage pressure on the working class.
[00:19:50.140 --> 00:19:53.980]   So you would think that having rode those issues
[00:19:53.980 --> 00:19:55.100]   all the way to the White House,
[00:19:55.100 --> 00:19:58.260]   that there would be some sort of reappraisal.
[00:19:58.260 --> 00:20:00.780]   And instead, it seems like what the elite did
[00:20:00.780 --> 00:20:04.720]   to protect itself was create these mythologies
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.560]   that Trump somehow got elected
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.660]   not because the people of the country were fed up
[00:20:10.660 --> 00:20:13.140]   with the way that it had been run for 20 years
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:16.420]   by both parties, but rather because the Russians
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:18.060]   somehow were behind it,
[00:20:18.060 --> 00:20:21.900]   or the country was shot through with white supremacy
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:23.480]   and that somehow explained it.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:29.820]   And so we never really got a true sort of accounting
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.740]   or reappraisal of what Trump's election meant.
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.020]   And instead, the media turned to this hysteria,
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.260]   this mode that we're not even out of yet.
[00:20:40.260 --> 00:20:41.340]   Your reactions to that?
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:43.580]   - No, I think it's one of the most amazing things
[00:20:43.580 --> 00:20:47.020]   about the 2016 election, which is, first of all,
[00:20:47.020 --> 00:20:51.240]   in a lot of ways, Barack Obama being this kind of
[00:20:51.240 --> 00:20:53.260]   once in a generation political talent
[00:20:53.260 --> 00:20:56.920]   papered over the incredibly serious systemic problems
[00:20:56.920 --> 00:21:00.100]   the Democrats had, even while he was being reelected
[00:21:00.100 --> 00:21:03.500]   underneath Obama and all of his glitter and glamor,
[00:21:03.500 --> 00:21:05.340]   the Democratic Party was collapsing.
[00:21:05.340 --> 00:21:08.260]   They were losing state houses and congressional seats
[00:21:08.260 --> 00:21:10.600]   and governorships all over the country.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:14.120]   And the reason for that is the anger,
[00:21:14.120 --> 00:21:16.740]   the growing anger with the neoliberal policies
[00:21:16.740 --> 00:21:18.860]   that the Democratic Party in the early 1990s
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:21.860]   had decided to embrace in lieu of the working class politics
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:23.580]   for which they had always been known.
[00:21:23.580 --> 00:21:27.380]   The kind of Clintonian pronouncement
[00:21:27.380 --> 00:21:29.460]   that the Democratic Party needs to start embracing
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:31.860]   corporate America instead of unions,
[00:21:31.860 --> 00:21:35.280]   that it needs to move much closer to this politics
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:40.160]   that says we're gonna encourage corporate America,
[00:21:40.160 --> 00:21:43.080]   we're gonna embrace the Pentagon and all of that,
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:45.700]   and it radically changed the Democratic Party
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:47.920]   into this party of technocracy and the elites
[00:21:47.920 --> 00:21:51.100]   culminating with the Obama presidency.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:55.480]   And what is amazing is in 2016,
[00:21:55.480 --> 00:22:00.480]   the Democrats lost the White House to a game show host.
[00:22:00.480 --> 00:22:04.240]   And so you would think they would wonder why that happened,
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:05.400]   as you were saying, right?
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:08.760]   You would think they would wonder what is it about us
[00:22:08.760 --> 00:22:12.520]   that caused us to lose to Donald Trump?
[00:22:12.520 --> 00:22:14.820]   And instead they invented this long list of people
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.480]   that they decided were to blame instead,
[00:22:16.480 --> 00:22:19.040]   Vladimir Putin principally, WikiLeaks,
[00:22:19.040 --> 00:22:20.840]   Jill Stein for having the audacity
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:22.780]   to continue to run for president.
[00:22:22.780 --> 00:22:24.300]   You know, a whole long list of villains,
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:26.160]   essentially everybody except themselves
[00:22:26.160 --> 00:22:28.600]   and the people who are responsible for it.
[00:22:28.600 --> 00:22:31.620]   And I think the most toxic narrative
[00:22:31.620 --> 00:22:36.020]   is the one that said the only reason Trump won
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.040]   was because the country is radically
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.120]   and fundamentally racist, and he capitalized on that.
[00:22:42.120 --> 00:22:43.720]   And what's so amazing about that
[00:22:43.720 --> 00:22:46.740]   is there are literally millions of voters,
[00:22:46.740 --> 00:22:50.120]   in excess of 10 million, depending on how you count,
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:52.200]   but definitely in excess of 10 million,
[00:22:52.200 --> 00:22:57.080]   voters who twice voted for Barack Obama in 2008 and '12,
[00:22:57.080 --> 00:23:00.760]   and then in 2016 voted for Donald Trump.
[00:23:01.660 --> 00:23:05.500]   There are increasing numbers of non-white voters
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:09.100]   all over the country moving to the Republican Party
[00:23:09.100 --> 00:23:11.180]   under Trump and voting increasingly for Trump.
[00:23:11.180 --> 00:23:13.520]   You had a larger share of black voters, Latino voters,
[00:23:13.520 --> 00:23:16.860]   Asian American voters than any Republican candidate
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:19.820]   in decades, and those trends are only worsening.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:24.820]   And so you have this media that has no interest
[00:23:24.820 --> 00:23:29.780]   and no ability to understand how the majority of people
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:31.320]   in the United States live, because their lives
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:34.160]   are completely separate, live in these isolated enclaves
[00:23:34.160 --> 00:23:36.100]   in this kind of liberal bubble.
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:40.560]   And just today there was this amazing article
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.660]   by Rolling Stone.
[00:23:41.660 --> 00:23:43.960]   It was about what most of you have probably heard,
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.960]   which was this horrific mass murder in Buffalo
[00:23:47.960 --> 00:23:51.200]   where an 18-year-old white kid feeding on this kind
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:55.540]   of ideology of racial hatred that has become fringe,
[00:23:55.540 --> 00:23:58.620]   but very dangerous around the West.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.380]   Went into a store that he knew was predominantly black
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:05.060]   and shot as many people as he could, killing 10 of them.
[00:24:05.060 --> 00:24:09.460]   And the article by Rolling Stone that was published
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:13.340]   this morning was, he is not a lone wolf shooter,
[00:24:13.340 --> 00:24:16.120]   he is a mainstream Republican.
[00:24:16.120 --> 00:24:18.380]   So I think all of you should be very careful
[00:24:18.380 --> 00:24:20.580]   because you're currently in a country where half
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.780]   of the people in this country apparently are psychotic Nazis
[00:24:24.780 --> 00:24:28.060]   on the verge of some sort of mass murder outbreak,
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:31.180]   including huge numbers of non-white Americans
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.940]   who are supporters of the Republican Party.
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:36.980]   And the more you kind of immerse yourself
[00:24:36.980 --> 00:24:39.900]   in a set of institutional beliefs
[00:24:39.900 --> 00:24:43.460]   and a kind of ethos of your enclave,
[00:24:43.460 --> 00:24:47.580]   just constantly hearing a belief reinforced and reinforced,
[00:24:47.580 --> 00:24:49.760]   the more you believe it, the more you're immersed in it,
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:53.500]   the more immune you become to facts that negate it.
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:56.940]   And so that's the reason why the media is so incurious,
[00:24:56.940 --> 00:24:59.740]   because they've embraced this narrative
[00:24:59.740 --> 00:25:02.380]   that the only reason anyone would vote for Republicans,
[00:25:02.380 --> 00:25:04.300]   the only reason anyone would vote for Trump
[00:25:04.300 --> 00:25:06.340]   is because they're racist or they're fascist
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:07.980]   or they're white supremacist.
[00:25:07.980 --> 00:25:11.980]   And it's left them completely unable to grapple
[00:25:11.980 --> 00:25:14.740]   with things like 10 million people voting twice for Obama
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:18.340]   and then for Trump, or the fact, as Matt alluded to,
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.900]   there were all kinds of people in 2016
[00:25:20.900 --> 00:25:22.740]   who if you asked them, they would say,
[00:25:22.740 --> 00:25:25.260]   "Yeah, I have two favorite candidates this year."
[00:25:25.260 --> 00:25:26.340]   And you'd say, "Who are they?"
[00:25:26.340 --> 00:25:29.900]   And they would say, "Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump."
[00:25:29.900 --> 00:25:33.300]   To a working journalist, most working journalists
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.340]   are pundits or political operatives, that makes no sense.
[00:25:36.340 --> 00:25:38.460]   They can't comprehend that because they see the world
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:41.260]   through this traditional left-right prism
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:43.340]   that for increasing sections of the country,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:46.500]   I would argue a majority, is no longer applicable,
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:48.140]   is no longer how they see the world.
[00:25:48.140 --> 00:25:53.140]   And this is so dangerous when you have this radical breach
[00:25:53.180 --> 00:25:56.820]   between the opinion-making journalistic class
[00:25:56.820 --> 00:25:59.100]   and elite class on the one hand,
[00:25:59.100 --> 00:26:00.940]   and most of the population on the other.
[00:26:00.940 --> 00:26:02.500]   They just live completely different lives,
[00:26:02.500 --> 00:26:05.760]   work with a completely set of beliefs about the world,
[00:26:05.760 --> 00:26:08.020]   have completely different sets of interests.
[00:26:08.020 --> 00:26:11.060]   And if you look at countries throughout history
[00:26:11.060 --> 00:26:11.940]   where that has happened,
[00:26:11.940 --> 00:26:14.580]   where there's been this complete divergence
[00:26:14.580 --> 00:26:16.840]   between the people who hold power in the country
[00:26:16.840 --> 00:26:17.920]   and the rest of the country
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.420]   over whom they exercise that power,
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:24.780]   instability at best, and usually much worse things,
[00:26:24.780 --> 00:26:25.860]   inevitably arise.
[00:26:25.860 --> 00:26:28.380]   And I really think that's the point that we're at.
[00:26:28.380 --> 00:26:33.260]   - Just quickly to piggyback on that,
[00:26:33.260 --> 00:26:35.860]   one of the big stories that went uncovered
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:37.460]   and continues to go uncovered
[00:26:37.460 --> 00:26:40.520]   is the transformation of the Democratic electorate.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:43.820]   The last time I looked at this,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:48.820]   41 of the richest 50 congressional districts in America
[00:26:49.020 --> 00:26:52.940]   had Democrats in those seats,
[00:26:52.940 --> 00:26:56.740]   and all of the top 10 richest districts
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:59.380]   were won by Democrats.
[00:26:59.380 --> 00:27:02.100]   Whereas as recently as 1992,
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.500]   the split was more like 50/50.
[00:27:04.500 --> 00:27:08.540]   If you live in an affluent suburb,
[00:27:08.540 --> 00:27:12.700]   the overwhelming majority of the voters there
[00:27:12.700 --> 00:27:14.900]   are going to be Democrats now.
[00:27:14.900 --> 00:27:18.220]   And the big divide in American politics
[00:27:18.220 --> 00:27:20.220]   is no longer about ideology.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:24.860]   It's significantly about income and even more, education.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.300]   It's a split between people
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:30.420]   who have high school degrees or less
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.020]   and people who are college educated.
[00:27:33.020 --> 00:27:35.900]   And this is one of the reasons why Donald Trump
[00:27:35.900 --> 00:27:38.860]   was so effusive in saying, "I love the poorly educated,"
[00:27:38.860 --> 00:27:41.780]   because they vote for him.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:44.040]   But this is another taboo subject.
[00:27:44.040 --> 00:27:45.500]   Nobody likes to talk about this
[00:27:45.500 --> 00:27:47.980]   because it speaks to a transformation
[00:27:47.980 --> 00:27:49.740]   that happened in the Democratic Party
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:51.660]   that began, I think, with Clinton
[00:27:51.660 --> 00:27:55.980]   when they went away from relying on unions
[00:27:55.980 --> 00:27:57.820]   for financial support.
[00:27:57.820 --> 00:28:02.780]   The DLC's big strategic idea was,
[00:28:02.780 --> 00:28:05.540]   "Let's be more competitive on the fundraising front
[00:28:05.540 --> 00:28:10.180]   "by being more pro-business or pro-growth."
[00:28:10.180 --> 00:28:12.300]   That was the term that they used a lot.
[00:28:12.300 --> 00:28:15.180]   And a couple of decades later,
[00:28:15.180 --> 00:28:16.620]   what you end up with is a party
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:19.780]   that no longer has any real organic connection
[00:28:19.780 --> 00:28:22.940]   to working people of any kind.
[00:28:22.940 --> 00:28:27.940]   And so, I think that's a massive factor in all of this
[00:28:27.940 --> 00:28:32.460]   is that the reporting on class politics has become taboo.
[00:28:32.460 --> 00:28:35.980]   All you have to do is go to a Donald Trump event
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:38.460]   and you can see it clearly,
[00:28:38.460 --> 00:28:41.220]   that the composition of the crowds
[00:28:41.220 --> 00:28:42.860]   is vastly different from what you see
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:44.300]   at a Democratic event.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.340]   And that's one of the reasons why they hated the media,
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:50.660]   because they saw us as upper class representatives
[00:28:50.660 --> 00:28:54.220]   of the coastal elite who all live in New York,
[00:28:54.220 --> 00:28:57.820]   LA, and Washington, which is true for the most part.
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:02.460]   And it got increasingly hostile as time went on,
[00:29:02.460 --> 00:29:03.820]   and that's why Trump was scoring
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:05.700]   so many points going after us,
[00:29:05.700 --> 00:29:08.260]   because we were symbols of the upper class.
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.260]   And that's another reason why I think
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.540]   the divide is no longer neatly
[00:29:14.540 --> 00:29:16.020]   between left and right anymore.
[00:29:16.020 --> 00:29:19.580]   It has a lot more to do with class than it ever did before.
[00:29:19.580 --> 00:29:21.180]   - Okay, David.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:22.780]   I'm over here to your, hey.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:24.140]   I know you wanted to take a question or two
[00:29:24.140 --> 00:29:25.180]   from the audience as we wrap up.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:26.460]   - Sure, yeah, let's take some questions.
[00:29:26.460 --> 00:29:28.180]   - And I thought I would kick it off.
[00:29:28.180 --> 00:29:33.100]   Great discussion about the left moving really far left
[00:29:33.100 --> 00:29:36.700]   and taking advantage of the Trump bump in their ratings.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.700]   I'm curious, you kind of left out Fox News
[00:29:38.700 --> 00:29:41.220]   kind of mastering Rupert Murdoch.
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:44.220]   They kind of created this playbook in a way,
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:45.660]   and the left copied it.
[00:29:45.660 --> 00:29:48.500]   Isn't that basically how it happened?
[00:29:48.500 --> 00:29:52.100]   People saw, wow, Fox Media is just making so much,
[00:29:52.100 --> 00:29:54.540]   Fox News specifically, is making so much money
[00:29:54.540 --> 00:29:56.940]   by picking a side that the New York Times
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:29:59.420]   and MSNBC, et cetera, all just said, you know what?
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:00.740]   We might as well pick the other side
[00:30:00.740 --> 00:30:02.900]   and just take this playbook and get the money.
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.540]   That's kind of what happened, isn't it?
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:08.220]   - I mean, I wrote a book about this called Hate, Inc.,
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:12.020]   which, yeah, that's basically the thesis is
[00:30:12.020 --> 00:30:15.380]   that Fox pioneered a new way to make money in media,
[00:30:15.380 --> 00:30:18.380]   which is sort of like the audience optimization model.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.500]   Like you pick a group, a demographic,
[00:30:22.500 --> 00:30:24.700]   and then you try to dominate it by feeding it news
[00:30:24.700 --> 00:30:27.540]   that you know that those people are going to respond to.
[00:30:27.540 --> 00:30:31.140]   That was never the way things worked before
[00:30:31.140 --> 00:30:32.940]   for an ordinary news agency.
[00:30:32.940 --> 00:30:35.220]   They would just cover what they thought was important
[00:30:35.220 --> 00:30:36.740]   and try to do the best that they could.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:38.500]   - Has anybody stayed neutral, Matt?
[00:30:38.500 --> 00:30:40.900]   I mean, like, if you look at Reuters or AP,
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:43.380]   it's clear the New York Times, MSNBC,
[00:30:43.380 --> 00:30:46.940]   they've just gone full, subscribe to us if you hate Trump.
[00:30:46.940 --> 00:30:48.980]   You know, we're going to give you what you want.
[00:30:48.980 --> 00:30:51.660]   But is there anybody in the middle still, Matt?
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:53.220]   - Well, I think that's one of the reasons
[00:30:53.220 --> 00:30:55.580]   why you're seeing Substack do well, right?
[00:30:55.580 --> 00:30:59.980]   Is it's not so much that it's left or right,
[00:30:59.980 --> 00:31:04.800]   or it's just that most people are not partisans.
[00:31:04.800 --> 00:31:07.260]   Most people live somewhere in the middle, right?
[00:31:07.260 --> 00:31:10.620]   And have opinions that are all over the place
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:13.580]   and they cannot stand turning on the television
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:17.060]   and knowing exactly what they're going to say ahead of time.
[00:31:17.060 --> 00:31:20.540]   And so they're looking for some place that's different,
[00:31:20.540 --> 00:31:22.440]   where you have differences of opinion.
[00:31:22.440 --> 00:31:24.460]   And that's why I think independent media
[00:31:24.460 --> 00:31:26.020]   is doing better than ever.
[00:31:26.020 --> 00:31:28.700]   - I mean, the most influential person in media,
[00:31:28.700 --> 00:31:31.820]   even though the mainstream part of the media
[00:31:31.820 --> 00:31:35.280]   never talks about him because he's not part of them,
[00:31:35.280 --> 00:31:37.300]   is without question Joe Rogan.
[00:31:37.300 --> 00:31:40.700]   He speaks to more people who are under, you know,
[00:31:40.700 --> 00:31:43.980]   85 years old, which is the cable audience,
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:47.200]   than anybody on television by far.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:48.820]   And it's because, as Matt just said,
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:50.940]   you cannot pin him down ideologically,
[00:31:50.940 --> 00:31:55.580]   nor does he have fealty to any one political faction
[00:31:55.580 --> 00:31:57.620]   or certainly to any political party.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:00.820]   He's just a curious person, sometimes on the left
[00:32:00.820 --> 00:32:03.160]   and sometimes on the right and sometimes neither,
[00:32:03.160 --> 00:32:04.840]   exactly like most Americans.
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:06.500]   - I mean, it's such a great point, Glenn.
[00:32:06.500 --> 00:32:09.420]   And in fact, if you were going to pin him,
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.340]   if you just looked at how he voted, he'd be a Democrat.
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:15.900]   And the fact that the Democrats have Joe Rogan
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:19.380]   and Elon Musk having been their supporters
[00:32:19.380 --> 00:32:21.580]   and voting for them for decades,
[00:32:21.580 --> 00:32:24.620]   and they're too stupid to pull them into their party,
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.460]   is just shows how-
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.540]   - They do the opposite.
[00:32:26.540 --> 00:32:29.220]   They say, "No, Joe Rogan, we know that you love
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:31.420]   Bernie Sanders, the most far left candidate
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:33.380]   ever to be viable in decades.
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:35.740]   But even though you love him, we're going to demand
[00:32:35.740 --> 00:32:38.820]   that you're our enemy and call you a far right fanatic,
[00:32:38.820 --> 00:32:41.140]   even though you don't think you are."
[00:32:41.140 --> 00:32:43.740]   - We're going to demand that Bernie Sanders
[00:32:43.740 --> 00:32:46.540]   renounce Joe Rogan's endorsement.
[00:32:46.540 --> 00:32:49.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:32:49.060 --> 00:32:51.260]   That's our plan for winning the election.
[00:32:51.260 --> 00:32:54.700]   - I mean, Sax, as much as you and I go at it
[00:32:54.700 --> 00:32:58.620]   with how absolutely horrific the Republican party is,
[00:32:58.620 --> 00:33:02.500]   I mean, the Democrats are so incompetent
[00:33:02.500 --> 00:33:06.540]   to not court the two most influential people
[00:33:06.540 --> 00:33:09.700]   in America today, Joe Rogan and Elon Musk.
[00:33:09.700 --> 00:33:10.740]   I mean, it's-
[00:33:10.740 --> 00:33:12.020]   - They're alienating them.
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:14.100]   They're radicalizing them away from them.
[00:33:14.100 --> 00:33:15.220]   It's even worse.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:17.460]   - I mean, is there any, I mean, Sax is just flabbergasted,
[00:33:17.460 --> 00:33:19.940]   but is there any way, Glenn, you can comment on this
[00:33:19.940 --> 00:33:23.340]   and explain what you think the Democrats are thinking?
[00:33:23.340 --> 00:33:24.980]   Or are they just not thinking strategically
[00:33:24.980 --> 00:33:26.260]   about winning elections?
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:31.340]   - I think in addition to what you guys just talked about
[00:33:31.340 --> 00:33:35.180]   in terms of MSNBC and CNN copying the model,
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.420]   there has been a radical change in the composition
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:40.460]   of the Republican party ideologically because of Trump.
[00:33:40.460 --> 00:33:43.340]   Not because Trump is some sort of like disciplined,
[00:33:43.340 --> 00:33:45.460]   political theorist or deep thinker,
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:49.180]   but because he ushered in, as David was saying earlier,
[00:33:49.180 --> 00:33:53.860]   he ran in 2016 in opposition to Bush-Cheney foreign policy,
[00:33:53.860 --> 00:33:55.980]   in opposition to Reagan economics.
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:58.740]   He railed against the power of large corporations
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.580]   at the expense of the working person,
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:03.060]   something you never would have heard from Reagan.
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.860]   But he also ushered in a lot of hostility
[00:34:05.860 --> 00:34:09.820]   toward agencies like the CIA and the NSA and the FBI,
[00:34:09.820 --> 00:34:12.180]   something that had always been the province of the left.
[00:34:12.180 --> 00:34:15.620]   And so now you have an enormous amount of space opened
[00:34:15.620 --> 00:34:18.580]   on the right for all kinds of views
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:20.060]   that had previously been closed.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.140]   And I think there's just a lot more vibrancy on the right,
[00:34:23.140 --> 00:34:24.300]   a lot more internal debate,
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:26.340]   whereas in the Democratic party,
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:28.140]   it's just a very much you're either with us
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:30.180]   or you're against us mindset.
[00:34:30.180 --> 00:34:32.900]   And any deviation, as we were talking about at the beginning,
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:35.540]   automatically results in them proclaiming either enemy,
[00:34:35.540 --> 00:34:37.260]   which doesn't seem like a very effective way
[00:34:37.260 --> 00:34:38.900]   of doing politics to me.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:41.460]   - Okay, let's take a quick question from the audience.
[00:34:41.460 --> 00:34:44.380]   - Let's talk about Elon behind his back before he joins.
[00:34:44.380 --> 00:34:45.300]   What's your guys' take?
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:46.220]   Is he serious?
[00:34:46.220 --> 00:34:47.300]   Is he gonna buy it?
[00:34:47.300 --> 00:34:50.340]   And what do you think the fallout's gonna be?
[00:34:50.340 --> 00:34:52.060]   - I don't know if he's going to buy it or not.
[00:34:52.060 --> 00:34:55.460]   I think that I haven't really gone into the details of that.
[00:34:55.460 --> 00:34:58.260]   But what I do think is fascinating is the reaction
[00:34:58.260 --> 00:35:02.380]   by people in media to even the proposition
[00:35:02.380 --> 00:35:05.020]   that he might buy Twitter.
[00:35:05.020 --> 00:35:08.020]   These are people who've been absolutely comfortable
[00:35:08.020 --> 00:35:12.540]   with a handful of people controlling 95 to 98%
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:18.820]   of the media distribution in this country for years now.
[00:35:18.820 --> 00:35:21.180]   They never ever once complained about it.
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:23.500]   Anytime you ever complain about censorship,
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:25.460]   they say, "Oh, that's not censorship.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:26.780]   "This is a private platform.
[00:35:26.780 --> 00:35:29.060]   "They can do whatever they want."
[00:35:29.060 --> 00:35:31.140]   That's always been the response.
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:33.380]   Suddenly Elon Musk comes along and it's,
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:36.420]   "Oh my God, the threat of an oligarch
[00:35:36.420 --> 00:35:38.940]   "taking over a media platform.
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:40.380]   "What are we ever gonna do?"
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:42.500]   - There were columns like that in the Washington Post,
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:44.140]   which is owned by Jeff Bezos.
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:44.980]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.740]   - Yeah, exactly.
[00:35:46.740 --> 00:35:47.860]   Yeah, the idea of the--
[00:35:47.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   - And isn't the New York Times run by a family for--
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:54.500]   - That's not really that poor.
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:56.580]   - Yeah, the so-called five generations.
[00:35:56.580 --> 00:35:59.180]   All right, we'll take a final question from the audience.
[00:35:59.180 --> 00:36:02.700]   - So I actually agree with a lot of what's been said here.
[00:36:02.700 --> 00:36:06.060]   And one of my questions is, we were talking about
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.740]   is Trump even ideologically a Republican?
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:12.260]   My question is, as long as one of them is winning,
[00:36:12.260 --> 00:36:16.100]   the Republicans or the Democrats, aren't both of them winning?
[00:36:16.100 --> 00:36:17.860]   Do you guys have any thoughts on that?
[00:36:17.860 --> 00:36:19.900]   - I didn't hear the, as long as one is--
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:21.900]   - As long as one of them, the Republicans or Democrats,
[00:36:21.900 --> 00:36:23.420]   are winning, are they collectively winning?
[00:36:23.420 --> 00:36:25.820]   I guess, shouldn't there be a third party?
[00:36:25.820 --> 00:36:29.140]   - I mean, isn't that the issue that it's such a binary,
[00:36:29.140 --> 00:36:30.860]   polarized system?
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:33.140]   I think Glenn said in the middle that we're really
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.380]   all more moderates.
[00:36:34.380 --> 00:36:36.620]   That's my belief, but just curious.
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:40.380]   - No, I mean, it's a great, you know, I think probably
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:43.620]   the worst media myth is that the two parties
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:46.700]   can never get along, there's no more bipartisanship,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.820]   they're so radically different, they can't agree on anything
[00:36:48.820 --> 00:36:51.460]   when the reality is they agree on most things.
[00:36:51.460 --> 00:36:52.900]   It's just that the only things we hear about
[00:36:52.900 --> 00:36:54.660]   are the times when they disagree,
[00:36:54.660 --> 00:36:57.660]   but overwhelmingly on foreign policy, on economic policy,
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.220]   Obama himself said the two parties are essentially playing
[00:37:01.220 --> 00:37:04.020]   within the 40-yard line, so the entire rest
[00:37:04.020 --> 00:37:06.540]   of the playing field is basically not part
[00:37:06.540 --> 00:37:07.980]   of the political process because they have
[00:37:07.980 --> 00:37:11.020]   the same fundamental beliefs, and I think one of the reasons
[00:37:11.020 --> 00:37:13.620]   why Trump was such a shock to the system
[00:37:13.620 --> 00:37:15.980]   was not because the Trump administration itself
[00:37:15.980 --> 00:37:18.060]   was a deviation from American political tradition,
[00:37:18.060 --> 00:37:20.860]   it wasn't, but because some of the things he said,
[00:37:20.860 --> 00:37:24.220]   like questioning NATO and whether it has viability,
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:27.820]   was designed to undermine that bipartisan consensus.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:29.620]   But I think in general, you're right,
[00:37:29.620 --> 00:37:32.020]   that the establishment wings of both parties
[00:37:32.020 --> 00:37:34.220]   are far more in agreement with one another
[00:37:34.220 --> 00:37:37.780]   than they are different, and I think you're also right
[00:37:37.780 --> 00:37:41.900]   that as long as those two wings of each party
[00:37:41.900 --> 00:37:44.340]   continue to trade power, the ruling class
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.380]   in the United States is very happy.
[00:37:46.380 --> 00:37:49.940]   - All right, let's give it up for Glenn, Matt, and Seth.
[00:37:49.940 --> 00:37:51.860]   - Thank you, everybody.
