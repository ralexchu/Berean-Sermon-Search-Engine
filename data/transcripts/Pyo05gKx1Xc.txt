[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   We become like what we watch.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   The objects of our attention shape our becoming.
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   Our potential as creatures is realized by what we behold.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   We are moldable creatures of clay,
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   conforming to whatever attracts our gaze most.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   What we behold shapes us for better or for worse.
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   And obviously this is a profound reality that carries with it massive implications
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   for our media diets in the digital age, as we'll hear today from Pastor John,
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   preaching long before the digital age.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   In this clip, over 30 years old, Pastor John is applying
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   the glorious text of 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18,
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   to our media diets. Here's Pastor John to explain.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   And then finally, my fourth suggestion,
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   and probably it's the most needful to hear
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   and the most practically applicable for change right now in your life,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   perhaps, is
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   focus your attention on the glory of God.
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   Focus your attention on the glory of God,
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   and there's a reason for this.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   You become what you behold.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   Now that's not just a nifty little saying.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   That's a straight out biblical paraphrase
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   of 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   I'll read it to you. 2 Corinthians 3, verse 18 says,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   "And we all with unveiled face
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   beholding the glory of the Lord
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   are being changed."
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   Just stop right there. How do you get changed?
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Behold the glory of God. If you
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   behold the glory of God and hold it in fixed view,
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   you will become like that. In your mind.
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   You will think the way God thinks, see the way God sees,
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   feel the way God feels, assess the way God assesses.
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   You will be repelled by the things that repel God when you behold
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   the glory of the Lord. Let me finish reading.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   "We all with unveiled face beholding the glory of the Lord are being changed
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   into His likeness from one degree of glory to another." I just love that phrase.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   It's so hope-giving because I know I've got such a long way to go.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   One degree of glory to another. It's progressive.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   The holiness that comes by beholding the glory of God does not happen
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   instantaneously. From one degree of glory to the next
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   we move toward the image of Christ.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   But the point I want to make here is, it happens
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   by beholding Him. If you've got your
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   eyes open to that text, you might want to just look across the page or somewhere
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   a chapter later. 2 Corinthians 4.16. Listen to this
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   awesome statement of the man, the old man. Paul's getting old here.
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   He's got arthritis maybe and his back aches and his eyes are not so good anymore
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   and his hearing's not so good and he can't walk as far.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   And he says, "So we do not lose heart, though our outer nature is
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   wasting away, our inner nature
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   is being renewed." It's the same word from Romans 12.2.
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   It's being renewed every day. Now how?
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   How, Paul? How do you as an old man get new every day?
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   The answer, for this slight momentary affliction
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   is preparing for us an eternal weight of glory beyond all comparison.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   Here's the reason. Because we look
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:06.000]   not to the things that are seen, but to
[00:04:06.000 --> 00:04:10.000]   the things that are unseen. For the things that are seen
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:14.000]   are temporary, but the things that are
[00:04:14.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   unseen are eternal. Now, here's the key to being new
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   brothers and sisters. You want to be new in your mind as a young person,
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   in your whole being and spirit as an old person, you want to be new?
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Stop watching
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   the world, which very practically comes down
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   to television.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   Stop watching
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   the world! Why would we want to be entertained by
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:50.000]   the unbelieving so much? Why
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   are we so hooked on the video and on the television
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   and on the movies and on the radio? World,
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   tell me, show me, feed me, shape me, make
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   me! That's what we're doing! Oh no, not really.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm not the least affected when I watch. You become
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   what you behold. And I just ask you
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   to compare in your life the degree
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   to which you behold the Lord Jesus and the glory of our God
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   compared to the degree to which you behold
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   the world. How do they compare?
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   Might there not be some insight here as to why we live in weakness
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   and failure and the temptations of our lives? Why we don't have
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   the effect in the world that we would like to have?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   Why our relationships can't be fixed?
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   Is there perhaps some correlation between the fact that we
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   focus so much on the world, we live in the world,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   we ooze world, we watch world,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   we read world? How many
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   of us read books that have spiritual wisdom?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   Look at television that has spiritual wisdom. Look at movies that have
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   spiritual wisdom. Read the Bible with its spiritual wisdom. How much time
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   do we devote to this biblical principle that is
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   unassailable? You become what you
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   behold. Lord, I urge you to check
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   out your lifestyle. Do you want to become
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   holy? Do you want to become new so that you see
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   like Jesus, think like Jesus, feel like Jesus,
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   love like Jesus, care like Jesus, judge
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   like Jesus? If you do, there is
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   an agenda. Watch Jesus
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   a lot. Father, I just
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   beg for the miracle of transformation in our lives.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   Would you come right now and just convict us and give us some
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   choices about how we spend your Lord's Day afternoon and evening?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Are we really going to go home?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   Are we going to spend more time tonight
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   asking the world, without
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   any God in it, to entertain us?
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   Then we will reap what we sow.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   And I just pray, Father, that that
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   not be so.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   In Jesus' name I ask it. Amen.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   Watch Jesus a lot. That is not complex, but
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   profound. A spiritual battle we must fight for out of a
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   firm conviction that we are becoming like what we behold.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   That is a prophetic word for our media diets in the digital age. Thank you to Ryan,
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   a pastor in Mississippi, who sent this to us. The clip was given to him
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   from someone in his church. So thank you for passing it along to us, Ryan.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   It comes from a 1990 sermon on prophecy
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   of all places, titled "Why the Gift of Prophecy is Not the Usual
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Way of Knowing God's Will," preached on April 1st, 1990.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   Thanks for listening to today's sermon clip. Our clips are now
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   crowdsourced. You tell us what bits of Piper's sermons changed your life, and we share that
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   clip with the APJ audience. If you've got one, email me. Send me your name, hometown, the sermon
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   title, and timestamp of where the clip happens in the audio. Tell me how it
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   impacted you. Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's our email address,
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. Well, we have
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   eschatology questions coming up on Friday and on Monday. First up, a
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   question about the timing of Christ's return and some debates in church history
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   over that timing. I'm your host Tony Renke. We are rejoined in studio
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   with Pastor John when we return on Friday to talk eschatology.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   We'll see you then.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:02.000]   [end]
