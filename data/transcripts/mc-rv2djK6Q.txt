[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:12.000]   Good morning church family, happy Lord's Day.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   Let us prepare our hearts for worship as we come before our God,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   who is the author and perfecter of our faith, who is the fountain of every blessing.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   So let's all sing together.
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   [Music]

[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:39.000]   [Music]
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   All right, good morning.
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   And again, we want to remind you, again, each Sunday,
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:51.000]   we're going to have this room kind of quiet for about 15 minutes before the service.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:55.000]   So we encourage you to come and participate and take some time to pray.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   As our theme this year is to watch and pray.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   And, you know, I was meditating and thinking about that.
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   Again, as I mentioned before, when I was preaching on that,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   that we can't, like normally in our life, if we don't communicate with that person,
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   an individual in our lives, we don't normally say we have a relationship with them.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   They're acquaintances.
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   We kind of know them, but we don't, it's not like an intimate relationship.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   And so in the same way, you know, our walk with God,
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   not only is a measurement of what we believe and how much we interact with the Bible,
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   but how often do we communicate?
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   How often do we personally interact with God?
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:36.000]   Is a direct reflection of the relationship that we have with Him.
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And so, again, we want to emphasize that, and that's why we're trying to implement various things
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   to kind of give you opportunity to pray corporately.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   But again, corporate prayer is just a reminder to the rest of us
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   that our personal prayer is important,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:55.000]   and we're hoping that that will kind of initiate our private prayer as well.
[00:20:55.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   So don't just rely on that.
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   And along with that, this coming Friday, we have our time of corporate prayer.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   And so we're going to be having it inside and outside.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   And so if you are planning to come, just so that we can be better prepared
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and set up the chairs properly.
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   So if you come early and you want to come inside, you guys can come stay in here.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   Otherwise, we'll be outside. So please sign up for that.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   So we'll know how many chairs that we need to set up for that.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Along with that, every Wednesday, starting this past Wednesday,
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   we're going to be having morning prayer from 730 to 830.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   It's going to be open here.
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   And those of you who kind of wrestle with prayer and your mind tends to wander,
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   it helps to have a designated time and designated place where you can pray.
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   And so that's why we're opening up.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   We know that you can pray at home, you can pray in your cars,
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:46.000]   but sometimes coming together and having a specific time where you've dedicated to prayer
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   really helps to do that.
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   So on Wednesday morning from 730 to 830 a.m., the doors will be open.
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   So if you want to come here, and if you're nearby, and maybe before you go to work,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   or even if you're working from home, you just want to come here and take some time to pray,
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:04.000]   it'll be open from 730 to 830 a.m. on every Wednesday.
[00:22:04.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   There will be other prayer times that we will, again, roll out and let you know as time goes by.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   But one more thing.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   Starting from not next Sunday, but from February 7th, our SEEDS department is going to be reopened,
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   and all our teachers who were volunteering for that are all health workers.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   And they told me that, again, Sarah, who's in charge of that department,
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   told me that they've all gotten their vaccine, so they're all ready to come back.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   And so A and B class, those are the four- and five-year-olds, are able to do that.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And starting from, again, not this Sunday, but the Sunday after, on February 7th,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   you'll be able to drop off your kids at the beginning of the service there from that day.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   Four or five years old, and obviously the other departments are still open.
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   All right, outside of that, the other announcements, you can look at it on the website or from your app.
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   We want to take some time to pray and give you an opportunity to get the offering, again, electronically,
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   or you can do it physically in the back if you choose to do so.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   All right, let's pray.
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that we have to be able to come to the throne of grace
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   with confidence to call you our Abba Father, that no matter how our week was this week,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   that we would rest upon the righteousness of Christ,
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   that our confidence, Lord God, is not because of who we are and what we have done,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   but because of what Christ has done for us.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   Help us, Lord God, to celebrate your grace and love for us this morning,
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   that even in our giving, Lord, help us to give with a cheerful heart.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   May it be multiplied that more people may be able to hear the gospel and come to you.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   So we ask for your grace, we ask for your blessing, we ask for the Holy Spirit to illumine our minds and our hearts
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:57.000]   for the sake of your name. In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:34:32.040 --> 00:34:48.200]   - Now you may take a seat.
[00:34:48.200 --> 00:34:51.640]   - All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:34:51.640 --> 00:34:53.240]   to Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:34:55.240 --> 00:34:58.540]   And we are gonna cover again just one verse.
[00:34:58.540 --> 00:35:02.040]   So at this rate, we're gonna be in Hebrews for a while.
[00:35:02.040 --> 00:35:06.640]   But as I said, these three verses, verse 20 to 22,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:11.640]   actually represents almost about 35 to 40 chapters.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:14.140]   And so the verse that we're looking at in verse 21
[00:35:14.140 --> 00:35:17.440]   about Jacob covers about 13 to 14 chapters,
[00:35:17.440 --> 00:35:19.240]   about 13 chapters.
[00:35:19.240 --> 00:35:22.440]   And so instead of just kind of doing a quick overview
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:24.640]   and saying by faith he did this and moving on,
[00:35:24.640 --> 00:35:26.540]   I think it'll be helpful for us to understand
[00:35:26.540 --> 00:35:29.440]   the context behind what it means
[00:35:29.440 --> 00:35:32.740]   when he says by faith Jacob did this, okay?
[00:35:32.740 --> 00:35:35.040]   So let me read it again in verse,
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:36.940]   let me just read verse 21,
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.640]   and then we'll jump into the text.
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:42.640]   By faith Jacob as he was dying,
[00:35:42.640 --> 00:35:45.040]   blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshiped,
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.540]   leaning on the top of his staff.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.360]   Let's pray.
[00:35:48.360 --> 00:35:52.940]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your guidance.
[00:35:52.940 --> 00:35:55.940]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to speak to us.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:00.140]   May your word be handled in a way that honors you,
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:02.640]   that only your voice may be proclaimed.
[00:36:02.640 --> 00:36:06.640]   Give us eagerness, Lord God, to hear from you
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:10.440]   and to apply and shape our hearts and our lives, Lord God,
[00:36:10.440 --> 00:36:12.540]   according to your will and purpose.
[00:36:12.540 --> 00:36:14.140]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:36:14.140 --> 00:36:18.740]   You know, through the pandemic,
[00:36:18.740 --> 00:36:20.340]   and I know that even in our church,
[00:36:20.340 --> 00:36:23.540]   there are some people who lost loved ones
[00:36:23.540 --> 00:36:24.440]   for various reasons.
[00:36:24.440 --> 00:36:25.940]   And obviously this happens, you know,
[00:36:25.940 --> 00:36:27.440]   that's just part of life.
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:29.740]   But, you know, it's especially hard
[00:36:29.740 --> 00:36:31.540]   when you lose someone during COVID
[00:36:31.540 --> 00:36:33.440]   because of all the restrictions at the hospital
[00:36:33.440 --> 00:36:34.840]   and at the funeral homes.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:36.840]   And, you know, this year,
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:38.640]   I didn't mention this to Lee,
[00:36:38.640 --> 00:36:41.440]   but, you know, Lee's father passed away
[00:36:41.440 --> 00:36:42.640]   and we were at the funeral
[00:36:42.640 --> 00:36:46.140]   and Lee's father actually left a letter
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:48.240]   to his children and his family.
[00:36:48.240 --> 00:36:50.040]   And I was really intrigued to hear
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:51.540]   because, you know, they were so blessed.
[00:36:51.540 --> 00:36:54.540]   And so he gave me an opportunity to read it
[00:36:54.540 --> 00:36:56.340]   and I was so encouraged by it.
[00:36:56.340 --> 00:36:58.340]   And again, obviously I don't know his father,
[00:36:58.340 --> 00:36:59.540]   I don't know what his life was like,
[00:36:59.540 --> 00:37:01.740]   but you could tell that in that letter
[00:37:01.740 --> 00:37:03.340]   how much God meant to him.
[00:37:03.340 --> 00:37:05.740]   And so everything that he wrote in there,
[00:37:05.740 --> 00:37:06.740]   and he wrote it to the family,
[00:37:06.740 --> 00:37:08.140]   he wrote it to each one of his children,
[00:37:08.140 --> 00:37:09.540]   that this is what he desires,
[00:37:09.540 --> 00:37:11.540]   and, you know, sharing his mistakes,
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:12.740]   that don't make these mistakes,
[00:37:12.740 --> 00:37:15.740]   but, you know, making sure that you guys prioritize,
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:18.340]   you know, church, prioritize God, prioritize his word.
[00:37:18.340 --> 00:37:21.940]   And I was just so blessed to read that,
[00:37:21.940 --> 00:37:23.740]   knowing that that was the last thing
[00:37:23.740 --> 00:37:27.640]   that he left behind to his family and children.
[00:37:27.640 --> 00:37:29.740]   You know, we take anything that somebody says
[00:37:29.740 --> 00:37:31.840]   in the last words very seriously
[00:37:31.840 --> 00:37:34.740]   because we know that it's not going to be frivolous,
[00:37:34.740 --> 00:37:36.140]   that whatever it was in your heart
[00:37:36.140 --> 00:37:38.040]   is what you're going to leave behind.
[00:37:38.040 --> 00:37:39.240]   This is what I want you to remember.
[00:37:39.240 --> 00:37:42.540]   This is the totality of the things that I know in life,
[00:37:42.540 --> 00:37:44.340]   that this is something that I want you to have.
[00:37:44.340 --> 00:37:46.640]   And that's how in the book of Ecclesiastes,
[00:37:46.640 --> 00:37:48.040]   Solomon at the end of his life,
[00:37:48.040 --> 00:37:50.940]   summarizes all of his experience and says,
[00:37:50.940 --> 00:37:53.140]   "The chief end of man is to fear God
[00:37:53.140 --> 00:37:56.340]   and to worship him, to obey him."
[00:37:56.340 --> 00:37:59.540]   That's why we take the Great Commission very seriously,
[00:37:59.540 --> 00:38:01.540]   because of all the things that Jesus taught,
[00:38:01.540 --> 00:38:03.740]   at the end, he gave that commission to the church,
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.640]   "Go make disciples of all the nations,
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:07.940]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:09.340]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit."
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:10.440]   He taught many other things,
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:12.940]   but the reason why we call that the Great Commission
[00:38:12.940 --> 00:38:15.440]   is because that was the last commandment
[00:38:15.440 --> 00:38:17.540]   that he left the church.
[00:38:17.540 --> 00:38:20.540]   And so since then, that's what drives the church.
[00:38:20.540 --> 00:38:22.040]   This is what he's placed us to do,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:25.340]   to go and be a light to the world.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:27.340]   And again, another thing that, again,
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:29.640]   that my dad said when, you know,
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:31.140]   he was alive that I remember, you know,
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:32.740]   when you, you know, when you're young,
[00:38:32.740 --> 00:38:34.340]   your dad says things, just kind of like,
[00:38:34.340 --> 00:38:36.440]   "Yeah, okay, you know, that sounds good."
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.840]   But years later, you think back,
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.540]   and it makes so much sense,
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:41.840]   and there's so much wisdom behind it.
[00:38:41.840 --> 00:38:43.540]   And one of the things that my dad said
[00:38:43.540 --> 00:38:45.240]   that really stuck with me, he said,
[00:38:45.240 --> 00:38:47.840]   "How you leave something is much more important
[00:38:47.840 --> 00:38:49.940]   than how you came."
[00:38:49.940 --> 00:38:52.240]   He said, "Much more important because how you leave
[00:38:52.240 --> 00:38:56.940]   is what they will remember from that point on."
[00:38:56.940 --> 00:38:58.740]   And again, it's so true.
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:00.440]   There's so much wisdom behind that,
[00:39:00.440 --> 00:39:01.440]   that we start with a bang,
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:03.640]   and then we end with a fizzle.
[00:39:03.640 --> 00:39:07.540]   And typically, that's how human relationships are, you know?
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.740]   Like, we start with excitement,
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:09.940]   and then it just kind of fizzles out,
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:12.340]   and then we have experience after experience
[00:39:12.340 --> 00:39:15.540]   of bad experiences.
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:18.340]   But it's much more important how we end
[00:39:18.340 --> 00:39:20.040]   than how we started.
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.840]   Jacob's life was a man who his,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:25.740]   we're talking about in this one verse,
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.640]   at the end of his life, he's blessing his children
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.940]   so that God's covenant blessing will be passed on.
[00:39:31.940 --> 00:39:34.240]   And in this short sentence,
[00:39:34.240 --> 00:39:37.240]   contains basically the totality of his life.
[00:39:37.240 --> 00:39:39.540]   What was most important to him is at the tail end,
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.040]   he knows he's going to die,
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:43.840]   and he wants to make sure that his children are blessed.
[00:39:43.840 --> 00:39:46.440]   And so that little phrase, "By faith, Jacob,
[00:39:46.440 --> 00:39:50.140]   as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph,"
[00:39:50.140 --> 00:39:51.940]   reminds us of the way he died,
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.140]   and what is stated about his death tells us
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:57.140]   that this man truly was a man of faith.
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:40:00.540]   In fact, in Numbers 23, verse 10,
[00:40:00.540 --> 00:40:04.240]   remember the prophet Balaam, right?
[00:40:04.240 --> 00:40:06.540]   He was trying to be recruited in order to put a curse
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:08.040]   on the nation of Israel,
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:10.140]   and he recognizing that this family
[00:40:10.140 --> 00:40:12.940]   had a special blessing from God, and he refuses,
[00:40:12.940 --> 00:40:15.140]   and in Numbers 23, verse 10, he says this,
[00:40:15.140 --> 00:40:17.440]   "Who can count the dust of Jacob
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:20.940]   or number the fourth part of Israel?
[00:40:20.940 --> 00:40:23.640]   Let me die the death of the upright,
[00:40:23.640 --> 00:40:28.140]   and let my end be like his."
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.040]   So even in Numbers 23, 10,
[00:40:31.040 --> 00:40:33.240]   there was something about Jacob's death
[00:40:33.240 --> 00:40:34.640]   that he says, "I want to die.
[00:40:34.640 --> 00:40:35.940]   Not only do I want to live like him,
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.940]   but I want to make sure that I die like him."
[00:40:38.940 --> 00:40:42.140]   And so this phrase, again, this verse in verse 21,
[00:40:42.140 --> 00:40:46.040]   contains all that they knew about his death
[00:40:46.040 --> 00:40:48.340]   that they were passing down from generation to generation.
[00:40:48.340 --> 00:40:51.140]   So what is contained in this verse
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:53.240]   that we are to glean from?
[00:40:53.240 --> 00:40:55.240]   So let's look at the text, right?
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:41:01.040]   Verse 21, "By faith, Jacob blessed Joseph's two sons."
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:04.640]   Do you notice something interesting here, right?
[00:41:04.640 --> 00:41:07.640]   Who are Joseph's two sons?
[00:41:07.640 --> 00:41:09.840]   It's his grandchildren.
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:11.540]   Usually, when the father passes away,
[00:41:11.540 --> 00:41:13.440]   he blesses his children.
[00:41:13.440 --> 00:41:15.340]   It's supposed to go to --
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:17.440]   the blessing really should go to his children,
[00:41:17.440 --> 00:41:20.140]   but here, the highlight and his blessing
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:21.740]   at the tail end of his life
[00:41:21.740 --> 00:41:23.440]   doesn't say he blessed --
[00:41:23.440 --> 00:41:24.840]   who should have been blessed?
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.240]   Reuben, right?
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:28.640]   Reuben was the first child of the 12,
[00:41:28.640 --> 00:41:30.040]   or any one of these children,
[00:41:30.040 --> 00:41:32.740]   but he says he blessed Joseph's two children.
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:34.940]   So what's going on here?
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.740]   That him blessing his grandchildren
[00:41:37.740 --> 00:41:42.640]   are highlighted above the others.
[00:41:42.640 --> 00:41:44.140]   Now, we already know
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:46.040]   that Reuben was the first child of the 12,
[00:41:46.040 --> 00:41:49.040]   and he's the one who should have gotten the double blessing.
[00:41:49.040 --> 00:41:50.440]   Instead, Reuben is bypassed.
[00:41:50.440 --> 00:41:53.140]   It says in Genesis 35, verse 22,
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:57.440]   "Because of his sin, he forfeited his birthright."
[00:41:57.440 --> 00:42:00.240]   That he ended up sleeping with Jacob's concubine
[00:42:00.240 --> 00:42:03.140]   and defiled that,
[00:42:03.140 --> 00:42:05.740]   and as a result of that, he lost his privilege.
[00:42:05.740 --> 00:42:07.140]   So it wasn't that he wasn't blessed,
[00:42:07.140 --> 00:42:11.840]   but his firstborn blessing was passed on.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:13.340]   And so that's what he's saying here.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.440]   He's passing it on.
[00:42:15.440 --> 00:42:17.740]   And so what I want to look at this morning
[00:42:17.740 --> 00:42:19.840]   is Genesis chapter 48, verse 1,
[00:42:19.840 --> 00:42:21.140]   to look at the context,
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:23.840]   the historical context behind which this takes place,
[00:42:23.840 --> 00:42:26.640]   and what is it about his blessing
[00:42:26.640 --> 00:42:28.040]   and his tail end
[00:42:28.040 --> 00:42:32.740]   that is meant to give us a reminder and as example
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:34.940]   what it means to be a man of faith.
[00:42:34.940 --> 00:42:36.840]   So Genesis chapter 48, verse 1,
[00:42:36.840 --> 00:42:38.140]   it starts off by saying,
[00:42:38.140 --> 00:42:39.740]   "Now it came about after these things
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:42.340]   that Joseph was told, 'Behold, your father is sick.'
[00:42:42.340 --> 00:42:45.840]   So he took his two sons, Manasseh and Ephraim, with him."
[00:42:45.840 --> 00:42:48.340]   You notice the order of the names of Joseph's son,
[00:42:48.340 --> 00:42:50.840]   Manasseh and Ephraim.
[00:42:50.840 --> 00:42:53.940]   Remember we said that whenever you see the order in something,
[00:42:53.940 --> 00:42:56.140]   there's significance in the Bible?
[00:42:56.140 --> 00:42:58.040]   So Manasseh is the older son.
[00:42:58.040 --> 00:43:00.040]   Ephraim is the younger son,
[00:43:00.040 --> 00:43:03.040]   and that's why they're mentioned in that order.
[00:43:03.040 --> 00:43:06.340]   But look with me in verse 5, chapter 48, verse 5.
[00:43:06.340 --> 00:43:09.240]   "Now your two sons who were born to you in the land of Egypt
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.140]   before I came to you in Egypt are mine."
[00:43:12.140 --> 00:43:14.640]   So this is Jacob talking to Joseph.
[00:43:14.640 --> 00:43:15.740]   And then he calls them,
[00:43:15.740 --> 00:43:17.740]   "Ephraim and Manasseh shall be mine,
[00:43:17.740 --> 00:43:20.340]   as Reuben and Simeon are."
[00:43:20.340 --> 00:43:22.240]   So there's two things that we need to recognize.
[00:43:22.240 --> 00:43:24.540]   One, where Jacob says,
[00:43:24.540 --> 00:43:26.640]   "I'm going to treat them not as my grandchildren,
[00:43:26.640 --> 00:43:28.840]   but my own children.
[00:43:28.840 --> 00:43:31.940]   I'm going to bless them just as I will bless my other children,
[00:43:31.940 --> 00:43:33.740]   I will bless them like my grandchildren.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.040]   So they're not going to get residuals from what you have.
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:39.040]   I'm going to directly put my blessing upon them."
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:41.240]   So that's the first thing that we need to recognize.
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:42.540]   But the second thing is,
[00:43:42.540 --> 00:43:46.040]   look at the order in which he mentions it, right?
[00:43:46.040 --> 00:43:49.640]   Joseph, it's Manasseh and Ephraim.
[00:43:49.640 --> 00:43:53.440]   Jacob mentions it by Ephraim and Manasseh.
[00:43:53.440 --> 00:43:55.740]   And there's a reason for that, right?
[00:43:55.740 --> 00:43:58.440]   It wasn't that the author was dyslexic
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:44:02.840]   and he was just getting the order mixed up.
[00:44:02.840 --> 00:44:05.440]   In verse 8 through 10,
[00:44:05.440 --> 00:44:10.040]   "When Israel saw Joseph's sons, he said, 'Who are these?'
[00:44:10.040 --> 00:44:11.140]   Joseph said to his father,
[00:44:11.140 --> 00:44:14.140]   'They are my sons, whom God has given me here.'
[00:44:14.140 --> 00:44:18.140]   So he said, 'Bring them to me, please, that I may bless them.'
[00:44:18.140 --> 00:44:21.740]   Now the eyes of Israel were so dim from age that he could not see."
[00:44:21.740 --> 00:44:25.240]   Does that remind you of something?
[00:44:25.240 --> 00:44:27.440]   Anybody who was awake last week, right?
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:29.040]   In the last week's text,
[00:44:29.040 --> 00:44:32.540]   and that whole drama of, you know, of Jacob scheming
[00:44:32.540 --> 00:44:35.440]   and taking over Esau's blessing
[00:44:35.440 --> 00:44:37.640]   because Isaac could not see and kind of tricking
[00:44:37.640 --> 00:44:41.340]   and, you know, put on fur to trick his dad?
[00:44:41.340 --> 00:44:42.640]   And he said, "Well, at the end of his life,
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:46.540]   I mean, his blindness may be genetic," right?
[00:44:46.540 --> 00:44:47.240]   So he said the same thing.
[00:44:47.240 --> 00:44:48.240]   He was in the same position.
[00:44:48.240 --> 00:44:49.640]   He could not see.
[00:44:49.640 --> 00:44:52.840]   And it was time to pass on the blessing
[00:44:52.840 --> 00:44:54.740]   starting from verse 11 through 20.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:57.240]   "Israel said to Joseph,
[00:44:57.240 --> 00:44:58.840]   'I never expected to see your face,
[00:44:58.840 --> 00:45:02.440]   and behold, God has let me see your children as well.'
[00:45:02.440 --> 00:45:05.040]   Then Joseph took them from his knees
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:07.040]   and bowed with his face to the ground.
[00:45:07.040 --> 00:45:10.040]   Joseph took them both, Ephraim with his right hand,
[00:45:10.040 --> 00:45:12.640]   toward Israel's left,
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.840]   and Manasseh with his left hand,
[00:45:15.840 --> 00:45:19.340]   toward Israel's right, and brought them close to him."
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:21.140]   And it was very deliberate
[00:45:21.140 --> 00:45:23.540]   because his father can't see.
[00:45:23.540 --> 00:45:26.240]   And so Joseph wanted to make sure
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:29.840]   that his older son had the right-hand blessing
[00:45:29.840 --> 00:45:31.440]   because the right-hand blessing
[00:45:31.440 --> 00:45:34.440]   meant that he was going to get the double blessing
[00:45:34.440 --> 00:45:35.640]   because he's the older child.
[00:45:35.640 --> 00:45:39.240]   So he did it deliberately in order not to make the mistake,
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:42.240]   right, not to make the same mistake that Isaac made,
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.840]   that he's making sure, okay?
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.440]   My guess is Joseph probably heard the story, you know.
[00:45:48.440 --> 00:45:50.640]   It was passed down how his father got the blessing.
[00:45:50.640 --> 00:45:53.740]   He's like, "No, you know, obviously this runs in the family.
[00:45:53.740 --> 00:45:55.340]   We're not going to let this happen again."
[00:45:55.340 --> 00:45:57.040]   So he takes them by their hand,
[00:45:57.040 --> 00:45:59.040]   and he places them so that all he had to do
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:02.140]   is put his hands on them.
[00:46:02.140 --> 00:46:05.340]   And so he brings them in that order, but in verse 14,
[00:46:05.340 --> 00:46:08.040]   "But Israel stripped out his hand, right hand,
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:10.840]   and laid it on head to head of Ephraim."
[00:46:10.840 --> 00:46:13.540]   So instead of doing this, what does he do?
[00:46:13.540 --> 00:46:17.340]   He does this, right?
[00:46:17.340 --> 00:46:20.340]   "Who was the younger and his left hand on Manasseh's head,
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.440]   crossing his hands, although Manasseh was the firstborn.
[00:46:23.440 --> 00:46:25.340]   He blessed Joseph and said,
[00:46:25.340 --> 00:46:29.240]   'The God before whom my fathers Abraham and Isaac walked,
[00:46:29.240 --> 00:46:32.540]   the God who has been my shepherd all my life to this day,
[00:46:32.540 --> 00:46:34.740]   the angel who has redeemed me from all evil,
[00:46:34.740 --> 00:46:38.340]   bless the lads, and may my name live on them,
[00:46:38.340 --> 00:46:40.940]   and the names of my father Abraham and Isaac,
[00:46:40.940 --> 00:46:42.940]   and may they grow into a multitude
[00:46:42.940 --> 00:46:45.240]   in the midst of the earth.'"
[00:46:45.240 --> 00:46:47.440]   So Joseph sees what's going on.
[00:46:47.440 --> 00:46:49.440]   His father is switching his arms,
[00:46:49.440 --> 00:46:51.940]   and maybe he's forgotten.
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:53.440]   He doesn't see correctly,
[00:46:53.440 --> 00:46:55.040]   and so Joseph tries to correct him.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:56.940]   In verse 17, "When Joseph saw
[00:46:56.940 --> 00:46:59.840]   that his father laid his right hand on Ephraim's head,
[00:46:59.840 --> 00:47:01.440]   it displeased him."
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:05.740]   You messed up, like father, like son, right?
[00:47:05.740 --> 00:47:08.240]   "It displeased him, and he grasped his father's hand
[00:47:08.240 --> 00:47:12.440]   and removed it from Ephraim's head to Manasseh's head.
[00:47:12.440 --> 00:47:15.040]   So Joseph said to his father, 'Not so, my father,
[00:47:15.040 --> 00:47:17.040]   for this one is the firstborn.
[00:47:17.040 --> 00:47:19.840]   Place your right hand on his head.'"
[00:47:19.840 --> 00:47:22.140]   Remember what happened to Jacob and Esau?
[00:47:22.140 --> 00:47:26.440]   Because Isaac blessed Jacob over Esau,
[00:47:26.440 --> 00:47:29.640]   they lived in contention and fighting all their life
[00:47:29.640 --> 00:47:31.740]   because Esau got mad.
[00:47:31.740 --> 00:47:33.340]   And I think maybe Joseph was thinking,
[00:47:33.340 --> 00:47:35.540]   "If you do this,
[00:47:35.540 --> 00:47:36.940]   these two are going to be fighting
[00:47:36.940 --> 00:47:39.340]   the rest of their life."
[00:47:39.340 --> 00:47:41.140]   And in order to say that, he said, "You did this wrong."
[00:47:41.140 --> 00:47:42.240]   And he was displeased,
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.440]   and he grabbed his father's hand to make it right.
[00:47:45.440 --> 00:47:49.040]   And Jacob says, first, but his father refused and said,
[00:47:49.040 --> 00:47:52.140]   "I know, my son, I know.
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:54.540]   I am not Isaac."
[00:47:54.540 --> 00:47:56.940]   I added that, that's not in the text.
[00:47:56.940 --> 00:47:59.640]   My guess is, he remembers all of this,
[00:47:59.640 --> 00:48:02.540]   and he said, "It's not a mistake.
[00:48:02.540 --> 00:48:03.940]   I'm not being tricked.
[00:48:03.940 --> 00:48:07.740]   I know I don't see, but this is deliberate.
[00:48:07.740 --> 00:48:10.840]   He also will become a people, and he also will be great.
[00:48:10.840 --> 00:48:14.340]   However, his younger brother shall be greater than he,
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.440]   and his descendants shall become a multitude of nations.
[00:48:17.440 --> 00:48:19.340]   He blessed them that day, saying,
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:21.940]   'By you, Israel will pronounce blessing,'
[00:48:21.940 --> 00:48:24.940]   saying, 'May God make you like Ephraim and Manasseh.'
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:29.640]   Thus he put Ephraim before Manasseh."
[00:48:29.640 --> 00:48:31.240]   It was not a mistake like his father.
[00:48:31.240 --> 00:48:33.240]   He was not being tricked,
[00:48:33.240 --> 00:48:38.240]   but clearly, it wasn't just a whim of Jacob.
[00:48:38.240 --> 00:48:42.840]   You know, since we got switched, I'm going to switch you, too.
[00:48:42.840 --> 00:48:46.640]   Clearly, Jacob knew something that God wanted him to do,
[00:48:46.640 --> 00:48:49.240]   that this was clearly God-ordained.
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:50.440]   This is not a mistake.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:52.240]   I'm not trying to get you to be contentious,
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:55.040]   and then create, you know, the older brother
[00:48:55.040 --> 00:48:57.040]   being angry and jealous all of his life.
[00:48:57.040 --> 00:48:59.240]   He said, "That's not what he's doing."
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:01.540]   God had a clear plan of what he was doing,
[00:49:01.540 --> 00:49:04.440]   and part of the reason, it doesn't spell it out for us,
[00:49:04.440 --> 00:49:07.740]   but if you look at the genealogies of Jesus,
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:09.740]   there are people in there that we would say,
[00:49:09.740 --> 00:49:13.140]   "That can't be the genealogy of Jesus.
[00:49:13.140 --> 00:49:16.840]   There's adulterers and murderers in that genealogy."
[00:49:16.840 --> 00:49:21.540]   If we were to create a genealogy of our Lord and Savior,
[00:49:21.540 --> 00:49:25.040]   that is not the genealogy that we would create,
[00:49:25.040 --> 00:49:27.040]   because anybody looking from the outside is like,
[00:49:27.040 --> 00:49:32.440]   "You worship a God who came from a prostitute, from a murderer?"
[00:49:32.440 --> 00:49:35.140]   One of the clear things that we see in Scripture
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:37.940]   is that God does not follow the natural pattern
[00:49:37.940 --> 00:49:40.440]   that you and I expect,
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:44.140]   and part of the reason why he does that is to make it clear
[00:49:44.140 --> 00:49:48.040]   that his blessing does not come by man's effort.
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.440]   It is God who chooses.
[00:49:50.440 --> 00:49:53.640]   It is God who is sovereign. He has his own plans.
[00:49:53.640 --> 00:49:58.940]   He's not submitted to man's desires, but his will.
[00:49:58.940 --> 00:50:01.940]   I think Joseph should have known from the very get-go
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:03.040]   that this was God's plan,
[00:50:03.040 --> 00:50:05.640]   because you know what Ephraim's name means?
[00:50:05.640 --> 00:50:09.940]   Ephraim's name means "double portion," right?
[00:50:09.940 --> 00:50:12.640]   And you know what Manasseh's name means?
[00:50:12.640 --> 00:50:15.240]   "Forgotten."
[00:50:15.240 --> 00:50:17.840]   So I would think that Joseph, when he brought them,
[00:50:17.840 --> 00:50:22.240]   he's like, "I hope they don't live up to their name."
[00:50:22.240 --> 00:50:25.440]   Clearly, God had ordained this, that this is what he desired
[00:50:25.440 --> 00:50:28.640]   in order so that his blessing would continue to go.
[00:50:28.640 --> 00:50:30.840]   But I also think we need to take a step back
[00:50:30.840 --> 00:50:32.040]   and understand what's going on here,
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:35.540]   because if it was simply the blessing to pass
[00:50:35.540 --> 00:50:40.440]   the double portion of his property and his name to his children,
[00:50:40.440 --> 00:50:42.440]   who was richer here?
[00:50:42.440 --> 00:50:45.840]   Usually when the father or grandfather passes away,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:50.140]   you're waiting because they have a lifetime of accumulation of wealth
[00:50:50.140 --> 00:50:51.640]   that they're passing down.
[00:50:51.640 --> 00:50:54.340]   And usually the older has more money than the younger.
[00:50:54.340 --> 00:50:59.040]   Usually, right? Think about who Joseph is.
[00:50:59.040 --> 00:51:01.040]   Think about who these children are.
[00:51:01.040 --> 00:51:04.740]   Joseph is the second in command to Pharaoh.
[00:51:04.740 --> 00:51:08.340]   Remember, Jacob and his children barely survived through the famine
[00:51:08.340 --> 00:51:09.640]   because of Joseph.
[00:51:09.640 --> 00:51:13.640]   So whatever Joseph had pales in comparison
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:15.940]   to what Joseph had had opportunity to have.
[00:51:15.940 --> 00:51:23.640]   So Ephraim's two children were heirs of whatever Joseph had.
[00:51:23.640 --> 00:51:27.640]   So humanly speaking, this blessing that's coming from Jacob
[00:51:27.640 --> 00:51:30.440]   really was nothing, humanly speaking.
[00:51:30.440 --> 00:51:33.840]   A double portion or triple portion or everything that you had
[00:51:33.840 --> 00:51:37.840]   probably was just a drop in the bucket to the wealth that they had,
[00:51:37.840 --> 00:51:40.840]   they had an opportunity to have.
[00:51:40.840 --> 00:51:44.440]   Obviously, this was not about the wealth.
[00:51:44.440 --> 00:51:46.140]   It wasn't simply about their name.
[00:51:46.140 --> 00:51:50.140]   It was about the covenant blessing that was coming from God.
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:51:52.640]   Far above any human wealth.
[00:51:52.640 --> 00:51:55.340]   Far above any power that Pharaoh would have had
[00:51:55.340 --> 00:51:58.140]   or they would have been heirs of.
[00:51:58.140 --> 00:52:03.940]   They're talking about the heir of what God has promised, God Almighty.
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:07.140]   And Jacob understood that. Isaac understood that.
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:08.540]   Abraham understood that.
[00:52:08.540 --> 00:52:11.740]   Now Joseph and his two children, Ephraim and Manasseh,
[00:52:11.740 --> 00:52:17.440]   is standing in line to receive that blessing.
[00:52:17.440 --> 00:52:21.540]   God, you could see God's sovereign hands when he says in verse 21,
[00:52:21.540 --> 00:52:29.140]   "By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each one of the sons of Joseph."
[00:52:29.140 --> 00:52:33.440]   It was faith. It was faith of who God is.
[00:52:33.440 --> 00:52:36.440]   He wasn't simply passing on material possession.
[00:52:36.440 --> 00:52:38.140]   It was God's blessing.
[00:52:38.140 --> 00:52:41.140]   But you know, we naturally ask the question,
[00:52:41.140 --> 00:52:43.740]   which Jacob would have also understood.
[00:52:43.740 --> 00:52:47.540]   Why does Jacob get it? Why does Ephraim get it?
[00:52:47.540 --> 00:52:50.640]   Clearly in Jacob's life,
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:55.440]   Jacob was, even though he was a schemer and he did all that he did,
[00:52:55.440 --> 00:53:04.140]   Jacob's life was a constant reminder to us that God blesses those who desire it.
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.040]   Jacob, a simple answer.
[00:53:06.040 --> 00:53:09.640]   God gave it to him because he wanted it more than anything else.
[00:53:09.640 --> 00:53:13.040]   He became the one who contended with God.
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.740]   And so God's blessing came down the line that, again,
[00:53:15.740 --> 00:53:17.340]   for the people who wanted it the most.
[00:53:17.340 --> 00:53:18.940]   Now was Jacob.
[00:53:18.940 --> 00:53:20.740]   Now he's passing it on.
[00:53:20.740 --> 00:53:22.940]   And then here's an interesting thing that he says.
[00:53:22.940 --> 00:53:26.540]   After that, he says he worshipped.
[00:53:26.540 --> 00:53:29.940]   Now, in our, the way that we speak of worship,
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:32.440]   you know, typically we say, "What time is your worship?"
[00:53:32.440 --> 00:53:35.440]   Right? We have one at nine o'clock. We have one at eleven o'clock.
[00:53:35.440 --> 00:53:37.740]   Well, when does your worship end?
[00:53:37.740 --> 00:53:41.140]   Right? Sometimes it ends at 10.15.
[00:53:41.140 --> 00:53:45.740]   Sometimes when I go long, it's 10.30.
[00:53:45.740 --> 00:53:49.040]   Right? And anything beyond that, you're frustrated.
[00:53:49.040 --> 00:53:51.240]   Right? That's when it ends.
[00:53:51.240 --> 00:53:54.440]   Right? So when does it end? When does it begin?
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:56.840]   How many people at your worship?
[00:53:56.840 --> 00:53:58.540]   Right? And that's the way we describe worship.
[00:53:58.540 --> 00:54:05.540]   But the word for worship here, about 80 to 90% of the New Testament translation of the word worship
[00:54:05.540 --> 00:54:09.040]   comes from this one particular word, proskuneo.
[00:54:09.040 --> 00:54:14.940]   And the word proskuneo literally means to be prostrated, to bow down.
[00:54:14.940 --> 00:54:22.340]   And the picture of this is clearly seen in the book of Isaiah chapter 6, verse 3 to 5,
[00:54:22.340 --> 00:54:26.840]   when Isaiah is given a glimpse of God's glory in his throne.
[00:54:26.840 --> 00:54:30.840]   And you have the three creatures who are circling around his throne,
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:34.640]   day and night, declaring, "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord of hosts.
[00:54:34.640 --> 00:54:37.840]   The whole earth is full of his glory."
[00:54:37.840 --> 00:54:42.240]   And they were praising God, and the foundations of the threshold trembled at the voice of him,
[00:54:42.240 --> 00:54:45.240]   who called out while the temple was filling with smoke.
[00:54:45.240 --> 00:54:50.740]   "Then I said," and this is Isaiah's response to seeing his glory,
[00:54:50.740 --> 00:54:54.840]   "Woe is me, for I am ruined, because I am a man of unclean lips,
[00:54:54.840 --> 00:54:57.740]   and I live among a people of unclean lips.
[00:54:57.740 --> 00:55:02.240]   For my eyes have seen the King, the Lord of hosts."
[00:55:02.240 --> 00:55:06.440]   It doesn't describe that Isaiah bowed down and he was prostrated,
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:10.240]   but you could tell by his words that's exactly what was going on.
[00:55:10.240 --> 00:55:14.940]   Because he could not lift his eyes to see his glory, in fact, he was terrified.
[00:55:14.940 --> 00:55:19.440]   Because something that was so magnificent, something that was all inspiring,
[00:55:19.440 --> 00:55:24.940]   that he was in front of, and naturally he bowed down, said, "Woe is me, for I am ruined."
[00:55:24.940 --> 00:55:31.740]   The word "proskoneo" literally means to be prostrated, to be bowed down, and leaned forward.
[00:55:31.740 --> 00:55:36.040]   In fact, another meaning behind this is to lean forward to kiss.
[00:55:36.040 --> 00:55:41.340]   To kiss the feet of somebody who is much bigger than you, much higher than you.
[00:55:41.340 --> 00:55:47.540]   I think we see this spontaneous worship, again, in sports arenas,
[00:55:47.540 --> 00:55:50.740]   or maybe you're watching something that's so awe-inspiring.
[00:55:50.740 --> 00:55:55.840]   As an example, if somebody, let's say LeBron James or Kobe Bryant, whoever you're a fan of,
[00:55:55.840 --> 00:56:01.540]   comes and he does a double, triple flip, back flip, behind the back,
[00:56:01.540 --> 00:56:06.040]   and he does a reverse dunk with five guys guarding him.
[00:56:06.040 --> 00:56:10.240]   As an example, I'm just trying to exaggerate for the purpose of the illustration.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:12.940]   And you see something magnificent, and what do you see?
[00:56:12.940 --> 00:56:21.140]   A lot of times his other players or the fan that's watching this are so affected by what he did,
[00:56:21.140 --> 00:56:24.840]   you see them getting up, what do they do? Raise their hand, what do they do?
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:29.240]   "We're not worthy. We're not worthy."
[00:56:29.240 --> 00:56:34.840]   That's what we see. This word "proskuneo" is a description of that.
[00:56:34.840 --> 00:56:41.240]   It's a description of when you're confronted with something so bigger than you, beyond you,
[00:56:41.240 --> 00:56:47.940]   that all you can do spontaneously, you burst out, it's like, "Oh my gosh, we're not worthy. We're not worthy."
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:49.940]   That's that word.
[00:56:49.940 --> 00:56:55.740]   Again, it is not wrong to say, you know, our gathering of worship at 9 o'clock and 11 o'clock,
[00:56:55.740 --> 00:56:59.840]   but when we limit, when that's our whole idea of understanding,
[00:56:59.840 --> 00:57:03.640]   it is a trivial understanding of what the Bible teaches about worship.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:07.640]   Worship is something when our eyes become open to His glory,
[00:57:07.640 --> 00:57:14.140]   and we recognize there's something so much more tremendously above that you and I could possibly comprehend,
[00:57:14.140 --> 00:57:21.740]   and we spontaneously respond in worship and adoration and awe and fear, all at the same time.
[00:57:21.740 --> 00:57:24.740]   That's that word "proskuneo."
[00:57:24.740 --> 00:57:31.640]   And that's how surrender happens. Surrender is not us trying so hard to make Jesus my Lord.
[00:57:31.640 --> 00:57:36.540]   Surrendering happens as you recognize He knows better than you.
[00:57:36.540 --> 00:57:40.140]   He's much bigger than you. He's much more important than you.
[00:57:40.140 --> 00:57:44.840]   And so when you are confronted by that, you end up surrendering.
[00:57:44.840 --> 00:57:47.740]   You recognize you know nothing. There's nothing that you have.
[00:57:47.740 --> 00:57:54.140]   There's nothing that you can say. There's nothing that you understand that goes beyond what you have just seen.
[00:57:54.140 --> 00:57:56.240]   That's "proskuneo."
[00:57:56.240 --> 00:57:59.540]   That's the word that is described when He says after He blesses them,
[00:57:59.540 --> 00:58:05.140]   He "proskuneo" then He worshiped God.
[00:58:05.140 --> 00:58:11.740]   Now, we have to understand when it says He worshiped God, right?
[00:58:11.740 --> 00:58:15.340]   Remember Jacob's life?
[00:58:15.340 --> 00:58:18.940]   Jacob schemed in order to get the blessing.
[00:58:18.940 --> 00:58:21.940]   Humanly speaking, we're going to look at that and say, "Well, that guy shouldn't be getting the blessing.
[00:58:21.940 --> 00:58:25.040]   Esau deserves the blessing."
[00:58:25.040 --> 00:58:28.740]   However you look at the circumstance, he gets the blessing.
[00:58:28.740 --> 00:58:32.140]   He comes out and remember the dream that he has, the Jacob's Ladder?
[00:58:32.140 --> 00:58:35.140]   He sees the angels going back and forth and God speaks to him, "What is this?"
[00:58:35.140 --> 00:58:38.840]   And then God reiterates the blessing given to him.
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:42.740]   Genesis 28, 13 to 15, "And behold, the Lord stood above it and said,
[00:58:42.740 --> 00:58:48.540]   'I am the Lord, the God of your father Abraham, and the God of Isaac, the land on which you lie.
[00:58:48.540 --> 00:58:53.340]   I will give it to you and to your descendants. Your descendants will also be like the dust of the earth,
[00:58:53.340 --> 00:58:57.940]   and you will spread out to the west and to the east and to the north and to the south.
[00:58:57.940 --> 00:59:01.340]   And in you and in your descendants shall all the families of the earth be blessed.
[00:59:01.340 --> 00:59:06.940]   Behold, I am with you and will keep you wherever you go and will bring you back to this land,
[00:59:06.940 --> 00:59:11.840]   for I will not leave you until I have done what I have promised you.'"
[00:59:11.840 --> 00:59:17.640]   Now, even though he schemed, even though he manipulated, and even though he lied,
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:22.640]   because he desired it more than anything else, God blesses him and he reiterates, "You have my blessing."
[00:59:22.640 --> 00:59:25.940]   God himself tells him that.
[00:59:25.940 --> 00:59:34.140]   If I heard this, I would automatically think, "I'm going to just start any business."
[00:59:34.140 --> 00:59:36.440]   Because God says, "He's going to bless me."
[00:59:36.440 --> 00:59:42.740]   I would automatically assume that I'm going to have 70,000 children.
[00:59:42.740 --> 00:59:48.940]   That you're going to have triplets, because you've got to populate the world, right?
[00:59:48.940 --> 00:59:53.040]   I would assume that you're going to be the owner of the largest piece of land.
[00:59:53.040 --> 00:59:57.040]   It's just going to plop down, that you would expect that.
[00:59:57.040 --> 01:00:01.040]   But that's not what happens, right?
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:06.640]   In fact, Jacob lives most of his life afraid of his older brother, Esau.
[01:00:06.640 --> 01:00:12.940]   He's constantly running in fear, because his brother was so angry that he got ripped off.
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:19.740]   And every opportunity he had, and that reason, like, after he gets the blessing, he has to go run.
[01:00:19.740 --> 01:00:23.240]   Remember what happens after that, after the Jacob's Ladder?
[01:00:23.240 --> 01:00:27.040]   He runs into Rachel and he falls in love.
[01:00:27.040 --> 01:00:28.840]   Remember that story?
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:32.640]   He falls in love and he has to work to get her.
[01:00:32.640 --> 01:00:38.040]   And that story is mentioned in Genesis 29, 17-20.
[01:00:38.040 --> 01:00:41.040]   It says, "And Leah's eyes were weak."
[01:00:41.040 --> 01:00:43.040]   Leah's Rachel's older sister.
[01:00:43.040 --> 01:00:46.840]   "And Rachel was beautiful of form and face."
[01:00:46.840 --> 01:00:49.140]   Let me stop right there, okay?
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:54.040]   He falls in love with Rachel because she was beautiful of form and face.
[01:00:54.040 --> 01:00:59.040]   But Leah was, her eyes were weak.
[01:00:59.040 --> 01:01:01.040]   What does that mean?
[01:01:01.040 --> 01:01:05.040]   Why does the author mention that she has poor sight?
[01:01:05.040 --> 01:01:13.040]   Most commentators believe it's a euphemism to say, "There wasn't much to look at."
[01:01:13.040 --> 01:01:14.040]   Right?
[01:01:14.040 --> 01:01:17.540]   I mean, this is politically incorrect.
[01:01:17.540 --> 01:01:18.740]   But the Bible just spells it out.
[01:01:18.740 --> 01:01:22.240]   This is the circumstance behind what happened, right?
[01:01:22.240 --> 01:01:26.940]   So again, next time you go on a date and you come back and your friends ask, "How was she?"
[01:01:26.940 --> 01:01:33.740]   Instead of saying she has a great personality, just say, "Her eyes were weak."
[01:01:33.740 --> 01:01:36.440]   And hopefully they read the Bible, they know what you mean, right?
[01:01:36.440 --> 01:01:37.440]   Because that's what he's saying.
[01:01:37.440 --> 01:01:38.440]   He's just laying out.
[01:01:38.440 --> 01:01:40.140]   There's not a lot to behold.
[01:01:40.140 --> 01:01:43.640]   But he falls in love with Rachel because she was beautiful.
[01:01:43.640 --> 01:01:48.740]   Now Jacob loved Rachel, so he said, "I will serve you seven years for your younger daughter,
[01:01:48.740 --> 01:01:49.740]   Rachel."
[01:01:49.740 --> 01:01:53.740]   And Laban said, "It is better that I give her to you than to give her to another man.
[01:01:53.740 --> 01:01:54.740]   Stay with me."
[01:01:54.740 --> 01:01:56.440]   Look what he says in verse 20.
[01:01:56.440 --> 01:02:00.540]   So Jacob served seven years for Rachel, and they seemed to him but a few days because
[01:02:00.540 --> 01:02:02.540]   of his love for her.
[01:02:02.540 --> 01:02:04.540]   Just seven.
[01:02:04.540 --> 01:02:06.540]   What's seven years?
[01:02:06.540 --> 01:02:07.540]   Right?
[01:02:07.540 --> 01:02:09.640]   He's falling in love with Rachel.
[01:02:09.640 --> 01:02:13.980]   If at the end of seven years I can labor and live like an indentured servant, if I can
[01:02:13.980 --> 01:02:16.040]   get Rachel, this is worth it.
[01:02:16.040 --> 01:02:18.580]   You know what happens.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.200]   Seven years he labors in love, it's nothing.
[01:02:21.200 --> 01:02:28.580]   And then on his marriage day, Laban, her father, tricks him and sends in Leah because he's
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.900]   probably concerned because her eyesight was not good.
[01:02:32.900 --> 01:02:40.140]   That maybe this is the best chance for him to get his daughter married off.
[01:02:40.140 --> 01:02:45.880]   So he tricks him and has him lay with Leah instead.
[01:02:45.880 --> 01:02:50.600]   And when morning comes, he said, "Well, you took Leah."
[01:02:50.600 --> 01:02:51.900]   And he said, "How can you do this to me?
[01:02:51.900 --> 01:02:53.600]   I worked seven years for you.
[01:02:53.600 --> 01:02:54.920]   How can you do this to me?"
[01:02:54.920 --> 01:02:59.120]   And just simply says, "It is not done in our land to have the younger marry before the
[01:02:59.120 --> 01:03:03.960]   older, so you have to take the older one."
[01:03:03.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   Seven years.
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:05.960]   Let's think about that.
[01:03:05.960 --> 01:03:06.960]   You know, just seven years.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:12.160]   It was like every year, every day, it's like one more day, one more month.
[01:03:12.160 --> 01:03:19.040]   You know, can you imagine on the seventh day, the last day, boom, I did it.
[01:03:19.040 --> 01:03:21.400]   Another seven years.
[01:03:21.400 --> 01:03:27.440]   Not for Rachel because of the bad-eyed girl, right?
[01:03:27.440 --> 01:03:31.560]   Can you imagine what the next seven years was like for him?
[01:03:31.560 --> 01:03:37.280]   If seven years went by fast, the next seven years probably was like torture.
[01:03:37.280 --> 01:03:41.560]   Bitterness and anger every single day, another day because I got tricked.
[01:03:41.560 --> 01:03:43.060]   That's his life.
[01:03:43.060 --> 01:03:46.120]   This is after God blessed him and said, "You're going to multiply.
[01:03:46.120 --> 01:03:47.480]   You're going to have this land.
[01:03:47.480 --> 01:03:49.800]   Everybody else is going to be blessed because of you."
[01:03:49.800 --> 01:03:53.200]   And now he's 14 years in labor because he got tricked.
[01:03:53.200 --> 01:03:56.000]   And then after the 14 years are done, he's ready to go.
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:59.120]   And then Laban says, "You can't leave."
[01:03:59.120 --> 01:04:01.400]   And he holds him for another six years.
[01:04:01.400 --> 01:04:08.520]   So for 20 years, he's living as an indentured servant after he received the promise of God.
[01:04:08.520 --> 01:04:14.000]   Well, after the 20 years, you would think that it would be done, but you know what happens,
[01:04:14.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   right?
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.360]   After 20 years, there's another disaster that happens.
[01:04:19.360 --> 01:04:24.040]   One of his daughters gets raped and his other sons get angry.
[01:04:24.040 --> 01:04:26.040]   They go and they kill that whole family.
[01:04:26.040 --> 01:04:29.320]   And that family, they're much more powerful and richer than he is.
[01:04:29.320 --> 01:04:36.800]   And so again, he has to pack up all his bags and he has to leave and run away to Bethel.
[01:04:36.800 --> 01:04:38.600]   That's his life.
[01:04:38.600 --> 01:04:40.480]   And he says, "Oh, the suffering is behind me.
[01:04:40.480 --> 01:04:41.480]   Hopefully, this is enough."
[01:04:41.480 --> 01:04:42.760]   But you know what happens?
[01:04:42.760 --> 01:04:45.080]   Contention happens within the brothers.
[01:04:45.080 --> 01:04:50.600]   And because Joseph has a dream that God had ordained that blessing was going to come through
[01:04:50.600 --> 01:04:53.600]   his family, remember what happens?
[01:04:53.600 --> 01:04:57.280]   His brothers get angry and they get jealous and they beat him and then they end up selling
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:00.760]   him as an Egyptian slave.
[01:05:00.760 --> 01:05:07.800]   So he loses his loved child most of his life.
[01:05:07.800 --> 01:05:10.040]   That's his life.
[01:05:10.040 --> 01:05:11.040]   That's most of his life.
[01:05:11.040 --> 01:05:13.160]   That was his life.
[01:05:13.160 --> 01:05:15.600]   After he received the blessing.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:19.800]   Now, you would think at the end of his life, he's like, "Well, I'm going to bless you."
[01:05:19.800 --> 01:05:22.240]   He's like, "I don't know if you want this blessing."
[01:05:22.240 --> 01:05:23.240]   You know?
[01:05:23.240 --> 01:05:25.480]   Because after I got this blessing, you know what happened to me?
[01:05:25.480 --> 01:05:29.840]   I don't know if I want to pass on this blessing.
[01:05:29.840 --> 01:05:33.400]   But he says he broke out in worship.
[01:05:33.400 --> 01:05:37.520]   How can he break out in worship after that?
[01:05:37.520 --> 01:05:43.440]   What was it that he knew that caused him to be prostrated?
[01:05:43.440 --> 01:05:51.080]   By this time, what Jacob knew, that the blessing was far beyond land.
[01:05:51.080 --> 01:05:53.360]   It wasn't about wealth.
[01:05:53.360 --> 01:05:59.160]   It was about the sovereign God, the God of Abraham, Isaac, and now Jacob.
[01:05:59.160 --> 01:06:04.040]   The promise that he made was going to be passed down.
[01:06:04.040 --> 01:06:10.120]   In fact, the time that has passed between the initial promise to Abraham to the passing
[01:06:10.120 --> 01:06:15.360]   of the baton to Joseph's children, 200 years have passed.
[01:06:15.360 --> 01:06:18.920]   No land, no nation, and they're not the superpower.
[01:06:18.920 --> 01:06:20.200]   200 years have passed.
[01:06:20.200 --> 01:06:24.800]   How many years pass, more pass, before they even enter their first step into the promised
[01:06:24.800 --> 01:06:25.800]   land?
[01:06:25.800 --> 01:06:30.000]   440 more years pass.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:39.160]   So after he blesses, if Jacob's life was hard, after he blesses Abraham and Manasseh,
[01:06:39.160 --> 01:06:44.880]   they become slaves for 400 years.
[01:06:44.880 --> 01:06:47.920]   I don't know if you want this blessing.
[01:06:47.920 --> 01:06:49.200]   Who would want this?
[01:06:49.200 --> 01:06:53.960]   I would scheme to get the other brother to be blessed.
[01:06:53.960 --> 01:06:56.520]   I would make sure that he gets it, even if I was the older brother.
[01:06:56.520 --> 01:06:57.520]   Give it to him.
[01:06:57.520 --> 01:07:00.160]   I don't want this.
[01:07:00.160 --> 01:07:06.200]   Hebrews chapter 11, 39 to 40 says this, "And all these, having gained approval through
[01:07:06.200 --> 01:07:13.000]   their faith, did not receive what was promised, because God had provided something better
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:18.280]   for us, so that apart from us they would not be made perfect."
[01:07:18.280 --> 01:07:24.520]   At some point in their journey, they realize it wasn't about the physical promised land.
[01:07:24.520 --> 01:07:25.920]   Their faith began to grow.
[01:07:25.920 --> 01:07:28.920]   It was much more than that.
[01:07:28.920 --> 01:07:30.300]   It was about salvation.
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:34.400]   It was about God's plan of redemption for mankind.
[01:07:34.400 --> 01:07:38.360]   And so his blessing that he's passing on to them is that God of the universe who blessed
[01:07:38.360 --> 01:07:42.040]   your grandfather, me, and now to you.
[01:07:42.040 --> 01:07:48.040]   You know what's interesting is that he proscene, okay, that's why he worshiped, because they
[01:07:48.040 --> 01:07:50.800]   saw a bigger God than Pharaoh.
[01:07:50.800 --> 01:07:57.120]   They saw a blessing much far beyond this physical world, that even in the greatest tragedy,
[01:07:57.120 --> 01:07:58.640]   God is still sovereign.
[01:07:58.640 --> 01:08:00.160]   There's a plan.
[01:08:00.160 --> 01:08:01.160]   And he believed that.
[01:08:01.160 --> 01:08:03.760]   And when he recognized that, he was bowing down and worshiping.
[01:08:03.760 --> 01:08:13.040]   You know what's interesting is after he worships, it ends with leaning on the top of his staff.
[01:08:13.040 --> 01:08:16.960]   And again, this is why inductive Bible study is so important, because when you just read
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:21.320]   it through, you're going to say, "Oh, he was blessed and he had a staff."
[01:08:21.320 --> 01:08:24.720]   And I don't know why that's there, but it's there.
[01:08:24.720 --> 01:08:26.400]   And I was wrestling with this all week, right?
[01:08:26.400 --> 01:08:31.200]   And I was trying to look at commentaries and listen to sermons and going back and forth.
[01:08:31.200 --> 01:08:32.200]   Why is that there?
[01:08:32.200 --> 01:08:37.220]   And so, you know, some people will say that, you know, the staff in the Bible oftentimes
[01:08:37.220 --> 01:08:39.240]   represents authority.
[01:08:39.240 --> 01:08:42.560]   So in Psalm 23, verse 4, it says, "Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of
[01:08:42.560 --> 01:08:44.440]   death, I fear no evil, for you are with me.
[01:08:44.440 --> 01:08:46.720]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me."
[01:08:46.720 --> 01:08:51.400]   So a shepherd would hold his staff basically as a weapon.
[01:08:51.400 --> 01:08:55.880]   So if the wolves come in, he would use that to protect and sometimes guide, right?
[01:08:55.880 --> 01:09:00.400]   Guide the sheep to go to discipline and get them to the right place.
[01:09:00.400 --> 01:09:04.360]   But why would that be stated here, right?
[01:09:04.360 --> 01:09:11.400]   Why would he worship and then he leaned on his staff?
[01:09:11.400 --> 01:09:17.360]   Think about what that staff meant particularly to Jacob, right?
[01:09:17.360 --> 01:09:22.040]   Think about what that staff meant specifically to Jacob.
[01:09:22.040 --> 01:09:26.340]   For Jacob, it wasn't just a symbol, right?
[01:09:26.340 --> 01:09:30.040]   For Jacob, it wasn't just because he was a shepherd and in the middle of shepherding,
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:32.240]   he had to have that staff to protect his animals.
[01:09:32.240 --> 01:09:35.960]   I mean, he was at his deathbed.
[01:09:35.960 --> 01:09:44.000]   That staff was his actual crutch because after all that scheming, at the end, he was about
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:48.160]   to meet his brother Esau and he knew that Esau wanted to kill him.
[01:09:48.160 --> 01:09:52.420]   And so he encounters the angel of God and he wrestled, remember that?
[01:09:52.420 --> 01:09:55.240]   He wrestles and he wouldn't let him go.
[01:09:55.240 --> 01:09:56.680]   So all night he wrestles with God.
[01:09:56.680 --> 01:10:01.480]   He said, "I'm not going to let you go until you bless me, until you make things okay."
[01:10:01.480 --> 01:10:04.600]   And then he says, "Okay, okay."
[01:10:04.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   So God ends up losing.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:08.560]   You know what I mean?
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:10.240]   I mean, of course he didn't really lose.
[01:10:10.240 --> 01:10:15.120]   God could have just like get away from me and then that would have been it, right?
[01:10:15.120 --> 01:10:19.040]   But he wanted Esau to contend with God.
[01:10:19.040 --> 01:10:22.120]   And as a result of that, what does he do?
[01:10:22.120 --> 01:10:30.040]   God dislocates his hip joint to remind him that this is the day that you wrestled with
[01:10:30.040 --> 01:10:31.920]   God.
[01:10:31.920 --> 01:10:38.120]   And so when they took his hip joint out, he had a limp all his life.
[01:10:38.120 --> 01:10:41.280]   So that staff to him was a crutch.
[01:10:41.280 --> 01:10:45.340]   And so God did that deliberately to remind him.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:52.720]   And the nation of Israel isn't called Abraham, isn't called Isaac, it's called Israel.
[01:10:52.720 --> 01:10:53.720]   After what he did.
[01:10:53.960 --> 01:10:59.920]   In fact, this event was so significant in Genesis chapter 32, verse 32, it says, "Therefore
[01:10:59.920 --> 01:11:04.840]   to this day, the sons of Israel do not eat the sinew of the hip which is on the socket
[01:11:04.840 --> 01:11:13.960]   of the thigh, because he touched the socket of Jacob's thigh in the sinew of the hip."
[01:11:13.960 --> 01:11:19.880]   All the things that he experienced, all the scheming and his business savvy and all of
[01:11:19.880 --> 01:11:27.600]   that he did, God made him limp all his life to remind him, right?
[01:11:27.600 --> 01:11:32.620]   That the blessing came to you because you contended with God.
[01:11:32.620 --> 01:11:36.560]   Because you sought after me, you wrestled and you said, "I'm not going to let you go."
[01:11:36.560 --> 01:11:40.600]   And then he named the whole nation, all the descendants after that.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:45.840]   So that every time they say, "Why are we called Israel?
[01:11:45.840 --> 01:11:49.640]   How come it wasn't named after Abraham?
[01:11:49.640 --> 01:11:52.360]   He's the one who started, he's the father of faith.
[01:11:52.360 --> 01:11:53.640]   He's the one who started all of this.
[01:11:53.640 --> 01:11:54.880]   Why aren't we called Abraham?
[01:11:54.880 --> 01:11:55.880]   Why not Isaac?
[01:11:55.880 --> 01:11:58.680]   Isaac's the one who was going to be offered."
[01:11:58.680 --> 01:12:00.200]   And it pointed to the coming of Christ.
[01:12:00.200 --> 01:12:01.960]   He was a clear type of Christ.
[01:12:01.960 --> 01:12:04.560]   Why aren't we called Isaac?
[01:12:04.560 --> 01:12:08.200]   Why are we called Israel?
[01:12:08.200 --> 01:12:11.480]   So that they would tell their children, it's because your grandfather, great, great, great
[01:12:11.480 --> 01:12:15.520]   grandfather, he contended with God.
[01:12:15.520 --> 01:12:17.460]   He sought after God.
[01:12:17.460 --> 01:12:23.200]   He wanted the blessing from God more than anything else in his life.
[01:12:23.200 --> 01:12:29.960]   And so that staff that he was leaning on is a reminder of all that journey.
[01:12:29.960 --> 01:12:36.320]   Because every time he took a step, it was a reminder that the greatest thing that he
[01:12:36.320 --> 01:12:41.440]   did in life was contending with God.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:45.680]   That's a consistent lesson that we see all throughout scripture.
[01:12:45.680 --> 01:12:47.360]   Whenever something goes wrong, we want to fix it.
[01:12:47.360 --> 01:12:51.120]   If we do this and organize this, we have the right people, we have the right finances,
[01:12:51.120 --> 01:12:53.800]   right program, right teaching, right discipleship.
[01:12:53.800 --> 01:12:59.560]   If we do all of this, we can get it right and make a church and do all of this.
[01:12:59.560 --> 01:13:01.480]   And at the end, when it works, what do we do?
[01:13:01.480 --> 01:13:03.520]   Because I was smart.
[01:13:03.520 --> 01:13:04.720]   Because I worked hard.
[01:13:04.720 --> 01:13:06.360]   Because I was disciplined.
[01:13:06.360 --> 01:13:10.800]   And all of that, if you're not careful, is man scheming.
[01:13:10.800 --> 01:13:14.840]   That somehow if we're smart enough, if we're good enough, if we have experience enough,
[01:13:14.840 --> 01:13:20.320]   if I know enough, if I'm talented enough, that somehow the blessing of God is going
[01:13:20.320 --> 01:13:22.800]   to fall on me.
[01:13:22.800 --> 01:13:25.760]   Remember what Jesus said to his disciples before he left?
[01:13:25.760 --> 01:13:31.040]   You cannot bear fruit unless you abide in me.
[01:13:31.040 --> 01:13:32.040]   He told them the same thing.
[01:13:32.040 --> 01:13:34.360]   Remain in me.
[01:13:34.360 --> 01:13:35.920]   Rely on me.
[01:13:35.920 --> 01:13:37.600]   Depend on me.
[01:13:37.600 --> 01:13:38.600]   Continue with me.
[01:13:38.600 --> 01:13:44.920]   Because you cannot bear fruit until you depend on me.
[01:13:44.920 --> 01:13:47.920]   This is why prayer is so important.
[01:13:47.920 --> 01:13:51.480]   That sometimes even Bible study is our scheming.
[01:13:51.480 --> 01:13:57.320]   If we know more, if we study more, if I exposit more, if I remember more, that somehow I'm
[01:13:57.320 --> 01:14:00.440]   going to force God's blessing upon me.
[01:14:00.440 --> 01:14:01.920]   No.
[01:14:01.920 --> 01:14:04.240]   Is when we surrender more.
[01:14:04.240 --> 01:14:06.660]   When we recognize we are weak.
[01:14:06.660 --> 01:14:12.280]   When we recognize with all the scheming that I had, he could not shake his brother.
[01:14:12.280 --> 01:14:17.320]   All the effort, all the money that he had could not quench his brother's anger toward
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:18.320]   him.
[01:14:18.320 --> 01:14:23.600]   And he knew that the only hope that he had is if God would protect him.
[01:14:23.600 --> 01:14:26.160]   And so he contended with God.
[01:14:26.160 --> 01:14:28.280]   And that's why he was delivered from that.
[01:14:28.280 --> 01:14:32.300]   It's the only what God can do.
[01:14:32.300 --> 01:14:37.960]   Education of mankind is not something that you and I do because we're clever.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:42.240]   That if you get the right gifted person who is rightly trained and give them the right
[01:14:42.240 --> 01:14:47.840]   education, read the right books, connect them with the right people, people will be saved.
[01:14:47.840 --> 01:14:50.660]   The arrogance of that.
[01:14:50.660 --> 01:14:58.200]   The human arrogance of thinking that God is looking for smart people to do his work.
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:14:59.200]   Program in a certain way.
[01:14:59.200 --> 01:15:01.320]   Organize in such a way.
[01:15:01.320 --> 01:15:11.000]   So, the greatest, greatest place where God is always taking his people is for us to surrender.
[01:15:11.000 --> 01:15:14.160]   Recognize I don't have it in me.
[01:15:14.160 --> 01:15:20.360]   And when I come before God and contend with God and surrender to God, begging God, asking
[01:15:20.360 --> 01:15:26.480]   God, he says he will answer.
[01:15:26.480 --> 01:15:29.680]   That's why he says ask.
[01:15:29.680 --> 01:15:32.760]   Seek and knock.
[01:15:32.760 --> 01:15:34.520]   And it will be answered.
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:36.340]   It will be given.
[01:15:36.340 --> 01:15:41.320]   And it will be opened.
[01:15:41.320 --> 01:15:43.920]   God is our answer.
[01:15:43.920 --> 01:15:52.840]   So in this short verse reveals to us his whole life, how a schemer became a worshiper of
[01:15:52.840 --> 01:15:54.840]   God.
[01:15:54.840 --> 01:15:56.840]   That's his story.
[01:15:56.840 --> 01:15:57.840]   That's your story.
[01:15:57.840 --> 01:15:59.960]   And that's my story.
[01:15:59.960 --> 01:16:04.560]   And this is why we need to watch and pray.
[01:16:04.560 --> 01:16:08.360]   Let's pray.
[01:16:08.360 --> 01:16:16.080]   Again, as we invite our worship team to come, let's take a few minutes to pray before God.
[01:16:16.080 --> 01:16:21.480]   Where are you in your walk with God?
[01:16:21.480 --> 01:16:26.400]   When's the last time you can honestly say that I wrestled with God?
[01:16:26.400 --> 01:16:29.200]   I'm contending with God.
[01:16:29.200 --> 01:16:33.960]   Is it just something that we just kind of prayer or something that we just kind of sprinkle
[01:16:33.960 --> 01:16:36.840]   on the things that we are doing?
[01:16:36.840 --> 01:16:40.360]   And even though we say glory to God, but in the back of our minds, we're taking most of
[01:16:40.360 --> 01:16:42.880]   the credit.
[01:16:42.880 --> 01:16:45.160]   Where's God?
[01:16:45.160 --> 01:16:47.080]   Let's take some time to really come before God.
[01:16:47.080 --> 01:16:51.560]   And there might be tons of things that we don't understand.
[01:16:51.560 --> 01:16:52.560]   They come before God.
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:57.360]   But I say that I don't understand Lord, but I believe in you.
[01:16:57.360 --> 01:17:03.400]   So again, this morning to commit to contend with God, that again, that the faith of Jacob
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:17.720]   will be reflected in our lives as well.
[01:17:17.720 --> 01:17:20.300]   (somber music)
[01:17:20.300 --> 01:17:23.720]   (somber music continues)
[01:17:23.720 --> 01:17:27.140]   (somber music continues)

[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:15.120]   (somber music continues)
[01:18:15.120 --> 01:18:38.820]   (somber music continues)

[01:18:51.560 --> 01:19:08.960]   - Let's all stand together again.

[01:23:15.340 --> 01:23:32.760]   - Psalm 63, one through five.
[01:23:32.760 --> 01:23:36.760]   "Oh God, you are my God, I shall seek you earnestly.
[01:23:36.760 --> 01:23:39.760]   "My soul thirsts for you, my flesh yearns for you.
[01:23:39.760 --> 01:23:42.760]   "In a dry and weary land where there is no water,
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.760]   "thus I have seen you in the sanctuary
[01:23:44.760 --> 01:23:47.760]   "to see your power and your glory.
[01:23:47.760 --> 01:23:49.760]   "Because your loving kindness is better than life,
[01:23:49.760 --> 01:23:51.760]   "my lips will praise you,
[01:23:51.760 --> 01:23:53.760]   "so I will bless you as long as I live.
[01:23:53.760 --> 01:23:56.760]   "I will lift up my hands in your name.
[01:23:56.760 --> 01:24:00.760]   "My soul is satisfied as with marrow and fatness,
[01:24:00.760 --> 01:24:03.760]   "and my mouth offers praises with joyful lips."
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:06.760]   Heavenly Father, we pray that this psalm
[01:24:06.760 --> 01:24:08.760]   would be our testimony.
[01:24:08.760 --> 01:24:11.760]   That it would be our confession.
[01:24:11.760 --> 01:24:15.760]   That our life, Lord God, would be patterned
[01:24:15.760 --> 01:24:18.760]   after the words of these psalms.
[01:24:18.760 --> 01:24:20.760]   Lord, we desire you.
[01:24:20.760 --> 01:24:24.760]   We thirst in our souls, we yearn, Lord God,
[01:24:24.760 --> 01:24:27.760]   to be near you, even in a dry and weary land.
[01:24:27.760 --> 01:24:30.760]   Lord, we hunger and thirst for righteousness
[01:24:30.760 --> 01:24:33.760]   so that we may be satisfied in you and you alone.
[01:24:33.760 --> 01:24:37.760]   Open our eyes, Lord God, that we may see your glory.
[01:24:37.760 --> 01:24:40.760]   Help us, Lord God, in our weak faith,
[01:24:40.760 --> 01:24:43.760]   that even in that small faith that we would surrender to you.
[01:24:43.760 --> 01:24:46.760]   So we pray that wherever you send us,
[01:24:46.760 --> 01:24:49.760]   help us, Lord God, to be the aroma of Christ.
[01:24:49.760 --> 01:24:51.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
