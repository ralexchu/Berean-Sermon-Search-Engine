[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.920]   A little bit of a review.
[00:00:01.920 --> 00:00:03.520]   I'm not gonna have you guys do this together
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.320]   because we are a smaller group,
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:09.640]   but let me ask you this, okay?
[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:12.800]   Genesis, what is it about?
[00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:14.280]   Just think in your head.
[00:00:14.280 --> 00:00:19.280]   Exodus, Numbers, Leviticus, Deuteronomy.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:23.760]   Those first five, you've probably got down, okay?
[00:00:23.760 --> 00:00:26.880]   Joshua, you have a picture in your head
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.680]   of a general standing over a city?
[00:00:28.680 --> 00:00:31.560]   Judges, right?
[00:00:31.560 --> 00:00:37.760]   Rest, relapse, ruin, repentance, restoration, rest.
[00:00:37.760 --> 00:00:42.320]   Ruth, you have that in your head?
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:47.000]   Last week we covered 1 Samuel.
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:49.440]   What was one sand mule about?
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:50.400]   You guys remember?
[00:00:50.400 --> 00:00:55.040]   Saul, how about two sand mules?
[00:00:55.040 --> 00:00:56.560]   What was two sand mules about?
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:00:59.840]   David, one king.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:05.080]   Solomon, remember there's a king with a half a heart
[00:01:05.080 --> 00:01:07.280]   surrounded by ladies with a mic.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:11.880]   Two kings, second kings, the divided kingdom, okay?
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.320]   One Chronicles.
[00:01:13.320 --> 00:01:17.240]   About David again, we're going backward.
[00:01:17.240 --> 00:01:20.280]   Two Chronicles, the line of Judah.
[00:01:20.280 --> 00:01:23.600]   So the north is not included now in the Chronicles.
[00:01:24.440 --> 00:01:28.080]   Ezra, Ezra, Ezra, Ezra, what's it about?
[00:01:28.080 --> 00:01:34.400]   Rebuilding the temple and basically the holy city again.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.920]   'Cause for 70 years it was uninhabited by Jews.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:42.200]   Only the peasants were there.
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.780]   And for 70 years it started being inhabited
[00:01:45.780 --> 00:01:48.080]   by all the peoples around.
[00:01:48.080 --> 00:01:51.280]   So they go back to Jerusalem, they rebuild the temple.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:53.560]   Nehemiah, what was that about?
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:56.080]   Nehemiah, rebuilding the wall.
[00:01:56.080 --> 00:01:57.980]   Because every time they tried to build a temple,
[00:01:57.980 --> 00:02:01.080]   everybody around them kept attacking them to stop the work.
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:03.640]   Because look, let's say 70 years ago
[00:02:03.640 --> 00:02:07.400]   someone left Mitchell Street, okay?
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:09.800]   And then all of a sudden someone shows up and says,
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.760]   "Hey, my ancestors lived here 70 years ago, get out."
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:16.720]   And they actually pitch a tent and build a little,
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:20.640]   like a shack in our lawn in the front.
[00:02:20.640 --> 00:02:23.440]   Obviously we're gonna not be happy about this, okay?
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:25.720]   So they actually build a wall around the whole city.
[00:02:25.720 --> 00:02:27.800]   And that's what Nehemiah is about, okay?
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:30.640]   And then there's different problems there.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:32.120]   What are the three bodies of water
[00:02:32.120 --> 00:02:34.020]   that run through the middle of Israel?
[00:02:34.020 --> 00:02:37.560]   Gals, who's dead?
[00:02:37.560 --> 00:02:38.960]   Jordan's dead.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:43.800]   Galilee, Jordan, Dead Sea.
[00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:45.560]   And clockwise, what are the enemies?
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:49.440]   Higher I am, may fail, right?
[00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:54.440]   Hittites, Arameans, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites,
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:59.560]   Philistines, and later, and then the Hittites,
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:00.800]   who did they become later?
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:02.000]   Who are they conquered by?
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:03.320]   The Phoenicians, that's a minor point.
[00:03:03.320 --> 00:03:05.120]   But on the maps later you'll look at that
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:06.880]   and you go like, the Phoenicians.
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:10.080]   So just so that you're not confused, I explain that.
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:12.140]   What are the major landmarks in Israel's history?
[00:03:12.140 --> 00:03:15.600]   2000 to zero, you could describe it now in depth,
[00:03:15.600 --> 00:03:17.000]   but we're just gonna go big.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Abraham, Moses, David, returns, Jesus, okay?
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:27.400]   And what was between 1500 to 1000?
[00:03:27.400 --> 00:03:30.480]   The only thing you really need to remember is Moses,
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:35.400]   and then you have the history of tribes, judges, kings.
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:38.360]   Who's the very first king of the nation of Israel
[00:03:38.360 --> 00:03:40.000]   who the people chose?
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:41.880]   Saul, who was God's choice?
[00:03:41.880 --> 00:03:43.680]   David, and that was 1010.
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:46.240]   And then 40, 40, 40, okay?
[00:03:46.240 --> 00:03:50.080]   And so Saul was bad.
[00:03:50.080 --> 00:03:53.800]   He was a Benjaminite, 'cause remember,
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:57.660]   the Benjaminites were a very shame-filled tribe,
[00:03:57.660 --> 00:03:58.500]   but he's from there.
[00:03:58.500 --> 00:04:01.800]   Benjamin, arrogance, disobedience,
[00:04:01.800 --> 00:04:07.920]   is followed by David, who was a Jewish-American.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:10.820]   Just kidding, he's a USA, right?
[00:04:10.820 --> 00:04:15.400]   United the tribes, established Jerusalem
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:16.520]   for the center of worship.
[00:04:16.520 --> 00:04:18.840]   Before, there was no capital for worship.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.680]   Everyone just worshiped wherever the priests gathered, right?
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:25.640]   And then, assembled masses of armies.
[00:04:25.640 --> 00:04:29.180]   His son Solomon, because David was so good at warfare,
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:30.640]   he was chilling, right?
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.680]   Temple, city, proverb, teacher, TCPT.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:38.680]   Temple, culture, peace, taxes,
[00:04:38.680 --> 00:04:43.440]   and for how many years did he reign?
[00:04:43.440 --> 00:04:48.440]   40, so king, king, then split happens at 931, 930, right?
[00:04:48.440 --> 00:04:50.800]   So we're there.
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:53.220]   What are some distinctions of the Northern Kingdom?
[00:04:53.220 --> 00:04:54.600]   How many tribes?
[00:04:54.600 --> 00:04:56.260]   10, how many on the bottom?
[00:04:56.260 --> 00:04:58.020]   Two, about four of you asked me,
[00:04:58.020 --> 00:04:59.840]   but on the map, it looks like there's four tribes
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:00.800]   on the bottom.
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.820]   Eventually, it's 10 and two, okay?
[00:05:03.820 --> 00:05:05.540]   How they get there, you're gonna have to fill in
[00:05:05.540 --> 00:05:07.260]   those pieces for yourself.
[00:05:07.260 --> 00:05:09.800]   10, two, what's the North called?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:13.420]   Israel, good or bad?
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:15.760]   Bad, what's their capital?
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:19.300]   Samaria, South, good or bad?
[00:05:19.300 --> 00:05:22.700]   Good, Benjamin, what's their capital?
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.040]   It stays Judah, okay?
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:28.940]   Up in the North, they can't worship,
[00:05:28.940 --> 00:05:30.820]   so they set up Dan and Bethel,
[00:05:30.820 --> 00:05:32.060]   and they set up golden calves,
[00:05:32.060 --> 00:05:33.120]   and eventually that ruins them.
[00:05:33.120 --> 00:05:35.480]   Who's the first king in the North?
[00:05:35.480 --> 00:05:36.980]   Junior, J.
[00:05:36.980 --> 00:05:39.780]   Jeroboam, who's in the South?
[00:05:39.780 --> 00:05:41.900]   Rehoboam, Jeroboam was Solomon's servant
[00:05:41.900 --> 00:05:44.140]   who ended up exalting himself.
[00:05:44.140 --> 00:05:46.460]   Well, the Lord helped him, he prophesied,
[00:05:46.460 --> 00:05:48.620]   but he exalted himself and became king.
[00:05:48.620 --> 00:05:49.780]   His family is kind of funny,
[00:05:49.780 --> 00:05:51.400]   and you're gonna read about that today.
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:53.180]   And then Rehoboam's the South,
[00:05:53.180 --> 00:05:55.640]   so he becomes a king.
[00:05:55.640 --> 00:05:58.900]   Let's see.
[00:05:58.900 --> 00:06:04.300]   Who are kings one, six, 11, and 16?
[00:06:04.300 --> 00:06:07.380]   King Rehoboam is what we need to remember.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:11.500]   Rehoboam, six, Ahaziah,
[00:06:11.500 --> 00:06:12.500]   11, Jotham,
[00:06:12.500 --> 00:06:19.040]   Josiah, okay?
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:21.260]   So let's fill in two through five.
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:22.580]   Do you remember last week we learned
[00:06:22.580 --> 00:06:25.820]   what was the little thing?
[00:06:25.820 --> 00:06:30.740]   Rehoboam's daddy, or Appah's Gigi, okay?
[00:06:30.740 --> 00:06:32.100]   Rehoboam, Abijah,
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:38.620]   Asah, and Asah's good, okay?
[00:06:38.620 --> 00:06:43.500]   Jehoshaphat, Jehoram.
[00:06:43.500 --> 00:06:46.020]   There's a lot of Jeho something, okay?
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:48.540]   There's a lot of 'em, so just keep that in mind
[00:06:48.540 --> 00:06:49.700]   and don't get confused.
[00:06:49.700 --> 00:06:51.620]   So we did one through six, 11 to 16,
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:53.340]   and today we're gonna do 10 to 15,
[00:06:53.340 --> 00:06:55.780]   or 10, is that right?
[00:06:55.780 --> 00:07:00.660]   Six through 10, okay?
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.420]   And then can you guys remember the half Bible cheer?
[00:07:02.420 --> 00:07:04.340]   We didn't focus on this too much last week.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:07.340]   King, king, split, A, B, C, D.
[00:07:07.340 --> 00:07:09.060]   Medo, Persians, returning Greeks.
[00:07:09.060 --> 00:07:12.180]   And today's focus is gonna be between the split
[00:07:12.180 --> 00:07:16.460]   and just up until Babylon, okay?
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:21.460]   So basically 9.30 to about 7.22 is where we're gonna focus.
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.900]   And then next week we're gonna talk about Babylon,
[00:07:24.900 --> 00:07:26.700]   captivity, destruction.
[00:07:26.700 --> 00:07:29.020]   The fifth week, is next week the fifth week?
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:30.060]   Oh, next week's the fourth week.
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.460]   The fifth week we're gonna look at all the returns,
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.860]   and then the sixth week we're gonna do a big review,
[00:07:34.860 --> 00:07:36.860]   and then we're gonna do what happens
[00:07:36.860 --> 00:07:39.140]   in the intertestamental period, okay?
[00:07:39.140 --> 00:07:40.860]   So we're taking it little clumps,
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:42.620]   and my goal is not to give you information,
[00:07:42.620 --> 00:07:44.260]   my goal is to what?
[00:07:44.260 --> 00:07:45.900]   Make you wanna learn, and you can do the same
[00:07:45.900 --> 00:07:47.180]   to other people.
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:50.500]   And I'm giving you the skeleton, what's your job?
[00:07:50.500 --> 00:07:53.300]   To put in the everything else, okay?
[00:07:53.300 --> 00:07:54.460]   To flesh it out.
[00:07:54.460 --> 00:07:57.660]   So you guys remember this one, okay?
[00:07:57.660 --> 00:08:01.100]   You guys know what everything stands for here?
[00:08:01.100 --> 00:08:03.300]   No problem, right?
[00:08:03.340 --> 00:08:07.220]   Abraham, Moses, David, returns, Jesus,
[00:08:07.220 --> 00:08:11.180]   tribes, judges, kings, and then we have the five R's,
[00:08:11.180 --> 00:08:16.180]   which were rest, relapse, ruin, repentance,
[00:08:16.180 --> 00:08:18.820]   restoration, and again and again.
[00:08:18.820 --> 00:08:20.220]   That is easy.
[00:08:20.220 --> 00:08:22.340]   So we looked at this last week,
[00:08:22.340 --> 00:08:25.820]   basically Mount JK, Moses, tribes, judges, kings,
[00:08:25.820 --> 00:08:28.420]   the only things we need to remember,
[00:08:28.420 --> 00:08:31.860]   to have 12 tribal territories, 10 sons of Jacob,
[00:08:31.860 --> 00:08:36.020]   one tribe of Joseph mixed, okay?
[00:08:36.020 --> 00:08:37.940]   12th tribe, what's their name?
[00:08:37.940 --> 00:08:43.060]   Levi, they didn't have land, okay?
[00:08:43.060 --> 00:08:46.620]   But they had 48 cities, six cities of refuge,
[00:08:46.620 --> 00:08:48.100]   three were on the east of the Jordan,
[00:08:48.100 --> 00:08:49.340]   three on the west of the Jordan,
[00:08:49.340 --> 00:08:50.660]   and technically, financially,
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:52.700]   they were supposed to be the richest tribe.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:55.380]   Because let's say everyone has 100 bucks,
[00:08:55.380 --> 00:08:59.220]   and they have to give $10 to the Levites.
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.660]   Everyone has 90 bucks.
[00:09:00.660 --> 00:09:02.100]   How much do the Levites have?
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.460]   $110.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.500]   So you guys follow me?
[00:09:06.500 --> 00:09:09.300]   So they're actually supposed to be the richest, okay?
[00:09:09.300 --> 00:09:10.940]   They just don't have a land.
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:14.500]   But that corrupted them, as you will later come to see.
[00:09:14.500 --> 00:09:20.020]   We looked at the bodies of water,
[00:09:20.020 --> 00:09:22.580]   Galilee, Jordan, Dead Sea.
[00:09:22.580 --> 00:09:26.220]   Are these bodies of water important in the New Testament?
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:28.980]   Yeah, because they don't move, okay?
[00:09:28.980 --> 00:09:30.500]   Jesus goes from Galilee,
[00:09:30.500 --> 00:09:33.860]   Jesus goes to, he's like baptizing,
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:35.620]   John's baptizing in the Jordan River.
[00:09:35.620 --> 00:09:37.140]   So you're seeing all of this, okay?
[00:09:37.140 --> 00:09:38.980]   So he's just going back and forth.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.780]   And they're fishing on the Mediterranean, okay?
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.580]   'Cause they can't fish on the Dead Sea, why?
[00:09:44.580 --> 00:09:46.660]   There's nothing there, it's dead, okay?
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:50.940]   So you're gonna slowly, if you remember Gales,
[00:09:50.940 --> 00:09:54.060]   Jordan's dead, you just, even in Jesus's time,
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:58.620]   you can kind of piece together what goes where, okay?
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:02.500]   And here I am, may fail, right?
[00:10:02.500 --> 00:10:06.080]   Hittites, Aramaeans, Ammonites, Moabites,
[00:10:06.080 --> 00:10:07.900]   Edomites, and the Philistines.
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:11.820]   Philistine capitals are very, they're worth memorizing,
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:13.900]   Ashdod, Ashkelon, Ekron,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:16.620]   like because in the Book of Amos, they get mentioned a lot.
[00:10:16.620 --> 00:10:19.540]   And later you'll see a bunch of people called the Ashdodites,
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.640]   they're Philistines.
[00:10:20.640 --> 00:10:23.060]   So just kind of keep that in mind.
[00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:24.900]   I'm giving you little bite-sized pieces
[00:10:24.900 --> 00:10:26.060]   so you don't get overwhelmed.
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:31.060]   But the Philistine cities are worth taking note of, okay?
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:36.400]   And then later the Phoenicians, take over there.
[00:10:36.400 --> 00:10:41.400]   We looked at the tribes, Israel, 10 tribes,
[00:10:41.400 --> 00:10:42.880]   capital is eventually Samaria,
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:44.660]   we're gonna look at that today.
[00:10:44.660 --> 00:10:46.460]   Worship was done at Bethel and Dan.
[00:10:46.460 --> 00:10:49.080]   Why was worship done at Bethel and Dan?
[00:10:49.080 --> 00:10:51.560]   Practically speaking, they can't go to Jerusalem
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:54.200]   because if they go to Jerusalem, what happens?
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:56.240]   They get punched in the face, okay?
[00:10:56.240 --> 00:10:57.080]   I don't know what happened,
[00:10:57.080 --> 00:10:59.120]   but like it's enemy territory now.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:02.680]   First King is Jeroboam I.
[00:11:02.680 --> 00:11:05.720]   If there's a one there, do you think there's gonna be a two?
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:07.060]   Yeah, he's important too, okay?
[00:11:07.060 --> 00:11:08.720]   He's actually probably the most,
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:13.720]   one of the most heralded kings of the Old Testament
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.120]   in the Northern Kingdom.
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:17.920]   But just so you don't get confused,
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:20.160]   you have to remember there are two Jeroboams.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:24.240]   The historical reference goes from First Kings 12
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:25.480]   to Second Kings 17.
[00:11:25.480 --> 00:11:29.340]   And then how many kings that were good?
[00:11:29.340 --> 00:11:30.420]   Zero, okay?
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:35.280]   We're gonna look at the Israel kings briefly today.
[00:11:35.280 --> 00:11:37.400]   South is a good place.
[00:11:37.400 --> 00:11:38.480]   What's it called?
[00:11:38.480 --> 00:11:39.320]   Judah.
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:42.280]   Two tribes, Benjamin and Judah.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:43.700]   Capital is Jerusalem.
[00:11:43.700 --> 00:11:45.820]   Worship is done in Jerusalem.
[00:11:45.820 --> 00:11:47.760]   Rehoboam, son of Solomon, is the first king.
[00:11:47.760 --> 00:11:48.960]   And who's his mom?
[00:11:48.960 --> 00:11:51.280]   That's not important, okay?
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:56.440]   Solomon's mom was Bathsheba, interestingly enough.
[00:11:56.440 --> 00:11:59.120]   What happened to Solomon's older sibling?
[00:11:59.120 --> 00:12:00.520]   Died, okay?
[00:12:00.520 --> 00:12:03.560]   So just keep those things in mind.
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:05.880]   Historical reference is a lot longer.
[00:12:05.880 --> 00:12:08.480]   And what's the difference between the references
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.900]   for the North and the South?
[00:12:09.900 --> 00:12:13.360]   There is zero chronicles in reference to the North.
[00:12:13.360 --> 00:12:16.660]   Chronicles are basically all about Judah, okay?
[00:12:16.660 --> 00:12:19.360]   So far you guys have followed thus far,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:22.600]   so you probably are now a little bit more,
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.780]   less intimidated by the Old Testament.
[00:12:25.780 --> 00:12:27.640]   Today we're gonna cover some more stuff
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:29.680]   that hopefully is a little bit fun.
[00:12:29.680 --> 00:12:33.200]   King-King split, ABCD,
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:35.400]   Medo-Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:12:35.400 --> 00:12:36.240]   Now,
[00:12:36.240 --> 00:12:44.180]   here's the Old Testament key number 12.
[00:12:44.180 --> 00:12:46.520]   Here we go, repeat after me.
[00:12:46.520 --> 00:12:48.020]   Are you guys ready?
[00:12:48.020 --> 00:12:50.220]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:51.960]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:12:51.960 --> 00:12:53.280]   Can you do that?
[00:12:53.280 --> 00:12:55.640]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:12:55.640 --> 00:12:58.200]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:12:59.120]   Proclaim it.
[00:12:59.120 --> 00:13:01.520]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:03.280]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:04.120]   Sing it.
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:06.200]   ♪ Split, two, seven, two, two ♪
[00:13:06.200 --> 00:13:07.400]   Or something, okay?

[00:13:09.760 --> 00:13:11.140]   How do you remember that?
[00:13:11.140 --> 00:13:12.440]   But you remember the cheer, right?
[00:13:12.440 --> 00:13:15.400]   Split, two, seven, two, two.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:18.760]   722 is very important historically, okay?
[00:13:18.760 --> 00:13:21.160]   So this is what it is.
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:22.440]   Split is?
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:24.340]   The civil war.
[00:13:24.340 --> 00:13:28.740]   The two is Oak Testament key number 13.
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:31.160]   Okay?
[00:13:31.160 --> 00:13:37.200]   And Samaria falling in northern kingdom,
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:38.460]   that's 722.
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:42.840]   Split, two, 722, split, two, 722.
[00:13:44.180 --> 00:13:46.560]   So you guys memorize the key number 12, right?
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:48.200]   No problem?
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:49.440]   Okay?
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:53.600]   Now, how do you remember all the stuff
[00:13:53.600 --> 00:13:57.760]   that happens between the civil war, okay?
[00:13:57.760 --> 00:13:59.520]   How do you remember all the stuff that happens
[00:13:59.520 --> 00:14:04.180]   between the civil war and the northern kingdom falling?
[00:14:04.180 --> 00:14:09.080]   There's an easy way, okay, to remember this.
[00:14:09.080 --> 00:14:12.920]   And I'm gonna sing a little song for you.
[00:14:12.920 --> 00:14:16.380]   ♪ We jammin' ♪

[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:32.380]   So, split, two, 722, and in the middle,
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:34.180]   who do you think of?
[00:14:34.180 --> 00:14:35.780]   Bob Marley.

[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.500]   Right, so that's what you need to remember,
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:52.920]   but we're gonna look at it like this.
[00:14:52.920 --> 00:14:59.200]   The landmarks of the middle, split, two, 722,
[00:14:59.200 --> 00:15:05.360]   the landmarks of that two is we, okay?
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:12.780]   And the Old Testament books that you need to know are jammin'.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:13.640]   All right?
[00:15:13.640 --> 00:15:15.640]   So, repeat after me, we.
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:18.220]   Say we.
[00:15:18.220 --> 00:15:20.560]   Jammin'.
[00:15:20.560 --> 00:15:22.640]   Okay?
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:25.720]   ♪ We jammin', we are jammin' ♪
[00:15:25.720 --> 00:15:26.560]   Okay?
[00:15:26.560 --> 00:15:27.500]   That's how you remember.
[00:15:27.500 --> 00:15:29.800]   So, what goes on with the we?
[00:15:29.800 --> 00:15:32.420]   War.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.820]   Elijah, Elisha, that's huge.
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.820]   Elijah and Elisha's ministry are both very huge,
[00:15:40.820 --> 00:15:41.860]   but they're in the north.
[00:15:41.860 --> 00:15:43.500]   They're not mentioned in the Chronicles,
[00:15:43.500 --> 00:15:45.880]   because Chronicles is about who?
[00:15:45.880 --> 00:15:46.860]   The south.
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:50.160]   So, Elijah, Elisha, mostly all in the north,
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:53.580]   and then the Assyria happens in 722.
[00:15:53.580 --> 00:15:54.860]   Got it?
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:57.740]   We are, and then what are the OT books?
[00:15:57.740 --> 00:15:58.580]   Jammin'.
[00:15:58.580 --> 00:16:05.460]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and Nahum
[00:16:09.260 --> 00:16:14.260]   are the books that correlate to this period.
[00:16:14.260 --> 00:16:20.200]   But Jonah and Nahum are in green, okay?
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:25.100]   And Jonah and Nahum are all basically about Assyria.
[00:16:25.100 --> 00:16:31.900]   Jonah is an invitation to Assyria to repent.
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:39.340]   Nahum, cover to cover, the three chapters
[00:16:39.340 --> 00:16:42.700]   are all about Nineveh or Assyria's
[00:16:42.700 --> 00:16:44.300]   utter and complete destruction.
[00:16:44.300 --> 00:16:48.820]   Okay?
[00:16:48.820 --> 00:16:51.500]   Oh, there's a part that's cut off on the bottom.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.820]   It actually says, "The fall of Samaria."
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:16:56.700]   Actually, no, no, nevermind.
[00:16:56.700 --> 00:16:58.740]   So, you guys got that?
[00:16:58.740 --> 00:17:02.200]   Split, two.
[00:17:04.700 --> 00:17:05.700]   Thank you, Gen I.
[00:17:05.700 --> 00:17:10.700]   Split, two, 722, split, two, 722, split, two, 722,
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.860]   and what's the two?
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.600]   We are jammin', okay?
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria, and what are the books?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:23.700]   Jammin', right?
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:28.700]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and Nahum.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:32.720]   And what two books are the bookends
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:36.720]   of the invitation and destruction of Assyria?
[00:17:36.720 --> 00:17:37.560]   Jonah and Nahum.
[00:17:37.560 --> 00:17:40.280]   Is that easy enough to remember?
[00:17:40.280 --> 00:17:42.000]   Okay, don't be intimidated by,
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   to read God's holy word.
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:45.840]   Here we go.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:50.760]   This is the Bible, what do you call it?
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:51.840]   The references.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:56.520]   War, you're looking at 1 Kings 14 to 16.
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:18:01.640]   Elijah is 1 Kings 16 to 22,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.480]   and remember, this is all going on in the north.
[00:18:05.480 --> 00:18:10.480]   Elisha is 2 Kings 1 through 8.
[00:18:10.480 --> 00:18:13.840]   So, 1 and 2 Kings, also there's a easy division
[00:18:13.840 --> 00:18:15.880]   between Elijah and Elisha.
[00:18:15.880 --> 00:18:18.760]   Elijah doesn't come up in 2 Kings.
[00:18:18.760 --> 00:18:23.440]   Elisha starts his ministry in 2 Kings.
[00:18:23.440 --> 00:18:26.840]   Got it?
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:31.800]   Assyria happens in 722.
[00:18:31.800 --> 00:18:34.000]   Now, Assyria's been around longer than 722,
[00:18:34.000 --> 00:18:35.320]   but what happens in 722?
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:37.560]   They take over Samaria.
[00:18:37.560 --> 00:18:39.720]   Okay, that's why it's an important time.
[00:18:39.720 --> 00:18:41.840]   And this section's a lot of fun to read
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.920]   because you actually read that Elisha
[00:18:44.920 --> 00:18:47.840]   ran faster than a chariot.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:52.040]   It's so interesting because the most famous king
[00:18:52.040 --> 00:18:54.360]   in the northern kingdom was Ahab,
[00:18:54.360 --> 00:18:57.880]   and Elisha just challenges Ahab,
[00:18:57.880 --> 00:19:00.560]   basically makes Ahab look bad,
[00:19:00.560 --> 00:19:02.720]   and then tells Ahab to go,
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:05.680]   and then he actually outruns him.
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:07.160]   Ahab's on a chariot of horses,
[00:19:07.160 --> 00:19:11.160]   but Elisha girds up his loins, and he just runs.
[00:19:11.160 --> 00:19:13.600]   And then one chapter later, he's scared of Ahab's wife,
[00:19:13.600 --> 00:19:16.360]   and he's hiding in a cave, scared of his life.
[00:19:16.360 --> 00:19:18.280]   So, you got all kinds of funny things
[00:19:18.280 --> 00:19:19.160]   that are going on in here.
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:20.480]   And then Elisha, the prophet,
[00:19:20.480 --> 00:19:23.200]   what does he do when someone calls him bald?
[00:19:23.200 --> 00:19:25.520]   He sends bears to kill the kids.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:27.200]   So, you just have all kinds of stuff.
[00:19:27.200 --> 00:19:30.120]   So, the Old Testament, if you know what you're looking at,
[00:19:30.120 --> 00:19:31.520]   it gets very interesting.
[00:19:31.520 --> 00:19:34.800]   You can make some funny cartoons and some movies out of it.
[00:19:34.800 --> 00:19:37.680]   Okay, old bald head, you bald head,
[00:19:37.680 --> 00:19:41.440]   send two bears, and just kill the whole village of kids.
[00:19:41.440 --> 00:19:44.360]   But this is all happening, was it southern?
[00:19:44.360 --> 00:19:49.040]   Is it Judah's kids that were killed by bears,
[00:19:49.040 --> 00:19:51.200]   or northern kingdom kids?
[00:19:51.200 --> 00:19:53.520]   Northern kingdom kids, okay?
[00:19:53.520 --> 00:19:58.000]   And then the fall of Samaria is described in seven chapters,
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:00.840]   constant attack, and an eventual fall.
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:07.000]   Okay, and then second Kings 14 to 16,
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   you have a correlation with the books of the prophets.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:17.520]   And the same thing is kind of repeated
[00:20:17.520 --> 00:20:19.320]   in second Chronicles 10 to 28.
[00:20:20.680 --> 00:20:21.800]   These are not things that you need
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:25.720]   to necessarily remember offhand.
[00:20:25.720 --> 00:20:28.920]   It's just kind of in reference, just kind of be mindful.
[00:20:28.920 --> 00:20:31.160]   We are Jaman, right?
[00:20:31.160 --> 00:20:35.840]   War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria.
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:40.240]   And what year was Assyria now conquering Samaria?
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.360]   What year?
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:44.480]   722, split, two, 722.
[00:20:44.480 --> 00:20:45.520]   We are Jaman.
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.040]   And what are the books of the Old Testament
[00:20:47.040 --> 00:20:50.560]   that correlate to the fall of Samaria
[00:20:50.560 --> 00:20:53.720]   and then the time between the split and the fall?
[00:20:53.720 --> 00:20:58.720]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, and then Nahum.
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:03.240]   And what two books of the Old Testament
[00:21:03.240 --> 00:21:06.640]   are all about the invitation to Nineveh
[00:21:06.640 --> 00:21:08.600]   and the destruction of Nineveh?
[00:21:08.600 --> 00:21:11.680]   Jonah and Nahum, okay?
[00:21:11.680 --> 00:21:14.960]   So we have this again.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:19.080]   We're gonna throw that in there.
[00:21:19.080 --> 00:21:24.000]   And you guys know what all of this is, right?
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.880]   So that's split, two, 722 is right there.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:31.120]   Okay, 930 to 722.
[00:21:31.120 --> 00:21:34.400]   That little section is the split, two, 722,
[00:21:34.400 --> 00:21:38.880]   war, Elijah, Elisha, Jonah, Jaman,
[00:21:38.880 --> 00:21:43.880]   Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum, okay?
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:47.640]   So just remember, who's that?
[00:21:47.640 --> 00:21:49.760]   We Jaman, okay, Bob Marley.
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:55.280]   War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria.
[00:21:55.280 --> 00:22:00.080]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum.
[00:22:00.080 --> 00:22:02.480]   So I said it, now I'm showing it to you.
[00:22:02.480 --> 00:22:04.720]   Hopefully this is etched into your brain.
[00:22:04.720 --> 00:22:06.960]   Easy enough?
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:08.320]   Okay, we're gonna move on.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:14.600]   The very first king of the Northern Kingdom.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:17.520]   We're gonna memorize all 20 kings of Judah,
[00:22:17.520 --> 00:22:22.400]   but we're only gonna memorize just a few kings of Israel,
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:26.680]   okay, because they are worth remembering to some degree.
[00:22:26.680 --> 00:22:31.680]   Now, you guys see Old Testament key number 14.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:36.880]   Just remember, Jeroboam, okay, B-O-A-M, Jeroboam.
[00:22:42.040 --> 00:22:44.040]   But if you look on the screen up there,
[00:22:44.040 --> 00:22:47.000]   that is actually not an M.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:48.160]   What does it look like?
[00:22:48.160 --> 00:22:53.560]   That is not an M.
[00:22:53.560 --> 00:22:56.080]   Some of you guys who are a little bit more like,
[00:22:56.080 --> 00:22:58.840]   like badly eyed, you're trying to squint,
[00:22:58.840 --> 00:23:03.080]   but that's a J and an H, okay?
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:08.280]   So just squint and turn a J and an H into an M,
[00:23:08.280 --> 00:23:13.280]   or break up the H of the M into a J and an H, okay?
[00:23:13.280 --> 00:23:17.400]   That's how you remember noteworthy kings
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:20.640]   of the Kingdom of Israel, okay?
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:24.720]   So we're gonna call it Jeroboam with a distorted M.
[00:23:24.720 --> 00:23:26.520]   And what two letters make up that M?
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.680]   J and an H.
[00:23:28.680 --> 00:23:33.000]   Now, if you look at your chart,
[00:23:33.000 --> 00:23:35.960]   I made a little chart with all the kings for you
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:39.720]   of the north, okay?
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:46.600]   Just take a look, okay?
[00:23:46.600 --> 00:23:50.800]   Like king number eight, Ahaziah,
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:52.300]   does that name sound familiar?
[00:23:52.300 --> 00:23:55.920]   Yeah, because that's king number six of Judah.
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.880]   Different dude.
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:01.160]   So if you're reading the first kings, you're like,
[00:24:02.760 --> 00:24:07.040]   and you're trying to do like cross-referencing other kings,
[00:24:07.040 --> 00:24:09.520]   you're gonna get confused.
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:13.520]   These are two completely different Ahaziahs, okay?
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:19.080]   The other Ahaziah actually starts his reign in 841,
[00:24:19.080 --> 00:24:20.800]   and he's the son-in-law of King Ahab,
[00:24:20.800 --> 00:24:24.720]   but the guy right before him is another Ahaziah.
[00:24:24.720 --> 00:24:26.820]   So it's just, if you're not familiar
[00:24:26.820 --> 00:24:29.680]   with what you need to look at, it gets confusing.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.360]   Jehoram, number nine, is actually,
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:35.720]   he's a southern king that we looked at last week, right?
[00:24:35.720 --> 00:24:40.280]   Okay, but he actually married into Ahab's family
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:42.280]   and partially was king for a little bit
[00:24:42.280 --> 00:24:43.880]   of the northern kingdom as well.
[00:24:43.880 --> 00:24:50.040]   Jehoahaz, that's king number,
[00:24:50.040 --> 00:24:55.640]   that's king number 17 in Judah,
[00:24:55.640 --> 00:24:57.200]   but this guy has the same name.
[00:24:58.100 --> 00:25:03.100]   King number 17, Jehoahaz, reigned from 609 to 609.
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:07.820]   He comes and disappears really fast,
[00:25:07.820 --> 00:25:12.640]   but this Jehoahaz was a couple hundred years before.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:13.760]   Don't get confused.
[00:25:13.760 --> 00:25:19.620]   Jehoash, there's two of them too,
[00:25:19.620 --> 00:25:23.260]   and one of them is a king of the south, okay?
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.880]   Zachariah, why do you know the name Zachariah?
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:35.820]   It's a prophet, but no evil, wicked king of the north
[00:25:35.820 --> 00:25:38.120]   would ever serve as God's prophet,
[00:25:38.120 --> 00:25:39.880]   so this is a different dude.
[00:25:39.880 --> 00:25:43.780]   Did you know there's like 14 Obadiahs in the Bible?
[00:25:43.780 --> 00:25:46.500]   So it's confusing if you don't know what to look for.
[00:25:46.500 --> 00:25:51.340]   So just remember that some of these guys
[00:25:51.340 --> 00:25:54.360]   have the same name as important guys
[00:25:54.360 --> 00:25:59.220]   in the southern kingdom, but they're not the same guys, okay?
[00:25:59.220 --> 00:26:04.220]   But Jehoram is also a southern king,
[00:26:04.220 --> 00:26:06.540]   okay, so that's all you need to remember,
[00:26:06.540 --> 00:26:09.420]   but we're gonna do Jeroboam,
[00:26:09.420 --> 00:26:11.180]   this Old Testament king number 14.
[00:26:11.180 --> 00:26:16.140]   The first guy you should remember is Jeroboam I,
[00:26:16.140 --> 00:26:17.700]   and what do you know about him?
[00:26:17.700 --> 00:26:23.620]   He's the servant of Solomon.
[00:26:23.620 --> 00:26:27.680]   He was the son of a Nabat, okay?
[00:26:27.680 --> 00:26:31.700]   But he was the first king who sinned against God
[00:26:31.700 --> 00:26:34.040]   by making anyone a Levite,
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:36.640]   by setting up Dan and Bethel for worship,
[00:26:36.640 --> 00:26:39.280]   so you need to know him because he's the first king.
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:44.760]   Second king you need to know is Baasha, okay?
[00:26:44.760 --> 00:26:50.120]   Baasha, so you need to know the Jerob
[00:26:50.120 --> 00:26:52.480]   and you need to know the Ba, okay?
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:57.480]   Baasha kills Jeroboam's son, Nadab,
[00:26:57.480 --> 00:27:00.800]   and Nadab is also familiar because what happened,
[00:27:00.800 --> 00:27:03.360]   who's the Nadab you guys are familiar with?
[00:27:03.360 --> 00:27:05.920]   Leviticus, right, one of the sons of Aaron.
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:09.200]   This Nadab is not that guy, okay?
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.000]   This Nadab was a son of Jeroboam.
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:15.320]   He reigned two years and then he was assassinated by Baasha.
[00:27:18.640 --> 00:27:23.280]   And then he wipes out all of Jeroboam's family.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.200]   So every single person that is alive in Jeroboam's family,
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.320]   Baasha wipes them out, okay?
[00:27:29.320 --> 00:27:31.440]   And then his family takes over as king.
[00:27:31.440 --> 00:27:37.440]   So Baasha is important to remember, okay?
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:40.980]   The next guy, what's his name start with?
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:47.240]   Oh, his name is Omri, okay?
[00:27:47.240 --> 00:27:49.320]   That's king number six.
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:57.160]   Omri is important because he kills all of Baasha's family,
[00:27:57.160 --> 00:28:00.520]   wipes them all out.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:07.760]   And then a guy named Zimri becomes king for seven days
[00:28:07.760 --> 00:28:12.680]   and the Baasha kills him, or no, Baasha attacks him
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.680]   and then when Zimri sees that all of the stuff
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:17.640]   around him is colliding, like it's falling apart,
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:20.640]   he sets the king's house on fire and he kills himself.
[00:28:20.640 --> 00:28:23.680]   So one of the five suicides mentioned in the scriptures.
[00:28:23.680 --> 00:28:28.680]   Okay, so Baasha and then Omri takes over.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:33.800]   Omri purchases a hill from a guy named Shomer
[00:28:33.800 --> 00:28:37.960]   in 1 Kings 16 for two talents of silver
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:41.360]   and he names that hill Samaria
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.920]   and he sets that up as a capital of the north.
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:46.560]   So who sets up Samaria as a capital of the north?
[00:28:46.560 --> 00:28:48.440]   Omri.
[00:28:48.440 --> 00:28:56.240]   Ahab introduces Baal worship
[00:28:56.240 --> 00:29:01.080]   and it destroys this nation.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:03.920]   And that's why Elijah and Elisha are always at his,
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:05.920]   just fighting with him, okay?
[00:29:05.920 --> 00:29:09.160]   Ahab was a wicked, wicked king.
[00:29:09.160 --> 00:29:10.360]   What's his wife's name?
[00:29:10.360 --> 00:29:13.000]   She's one of the few women
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:14.280]   that everybody knows in the Bible.
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:15.200]   What's her name?
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.200]   Jezebel, okay?
[00:29:17.200 --> 00:29:19.520]   So Ahab, you should just kind of remember
[00:29:19.520 --> 00:29:22.440]   that he introduced Baal worship and he's bad, okay?
[00:29:22.440 --> 00:29:29.440]   So Jeroboam, the next one is that distorted M.
[00:29:29.440 --> 00:29:32.580]   That first half of the distorted M is the J, right?
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:33.800]   But this J is easy to remember
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:35.320]   because it's another Jeroboam.
[00:29:35.320 --> 00:29:41.960]   Jeroboam II basically made Israel
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.020]   the richest it had ever been.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:51.280]   And because Jeroboam made this country so rich
[00:29:51.280 --> 00:29:54.900]   and he said it's because God is blessing us.
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.600]   So he actually sets up like revival dates,
[00:29:57.600 --> 00:30:00.860]   he sets worship times and he does all of this stuff
[00:30:00.860 --> 00:30:02.580]   with a pretense of worship because look,
[00:30:02.580 --> 00:30:04.560]   God is favoring us.
[00:30:04.560 --> 00:30:08.720]   We have now a great nation that's wealthy.
[00:30:08.720 --> 00:30:11.080]   In the book of Amos, God shows up and says,
[00:30:11.080 --> 00:30:15.160]   shut up, away with the noise of your songs.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:17.840]   I am tired of your symbols,
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.420]   but let justice and mercy flow on like a river.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:24.840]   So Amos is written to the north at their richest time
[00:30:24.840 --> 00:30:27.360]   and they're very religious.
[00:30:27.360 --> 00:30:31.760]   So that would probably speak volumes into our society, right?
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:34.760]   Oh, God is blessing us or even Korean society.
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:38.100]   God is blessing us, but is God happy with you?
[00:30:39.180 --> 00:30:40.660]   Is money a sign of blessing?
[00:30:40.660 --> 00:30:41.880]   Not always.
[00:30:41.880 --> 00:30:44.140]   It's a sign that God has given you over.
[00:30:44.140 --> 00:30:47.340]   But what king was responsible for financial reform?
[00:30:47.340 --> 00:30:50.480]   Number two, okay?
[00:30:50.480 --> 00:30:52.900]   Not related to Jeroboam I, okay?
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:54.180]   So different guy.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:57.020]   And the last one you need to know, his name is Hosea.
[00:30:57.020 --> 00:31:01.780]   And I just call him Hosea, okay?
[00:31:01.780 --> 00:31:06.100]   Because the northern kingdom got hushed after him.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:09.040]   All right, and there goes the northern kingdom, it's done.
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:13.360]   So you have 18 kings of the northern kingdom.
[00:31:13.360 --> 00:31:15.220]   Who do you need to remember?
[00:31:15.220 --> 00:31:18.900]   I'm gonna give you a little bit to write down
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:21.100]   and then I'll turn this off, okay?
[00:31:21.100 --> 00:31:23.900]   Five seconds.
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:28.900]   All right.
[00:31:28.900 --> 00:31:34.580]   Split, two, what year?
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:36.860]   Oh, you guys are genius.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:41.160]   So in the two, between 930 and 722,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.800]   what are the major landmarks that you need to remember?
[00:31:44.800 --> 00:31:49.800]   War, Elijah, Elisha, Assyria.
[00:31:49.800 --> 00:31:52.820]   What books of the Old Testament fall into that period?
[00:31:52.820 --> 00:31:59.400]   Jonah, Amos, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah, Nahum.
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:07.200]   What two books of the Old Testament
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:12.200]   focus mostly on the repentance and destruction of Assyria?
[00:32:12.200 --> 00:32:16.000]   Jonah and Nahum.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:18.500]   So there are 18 kings of the northern kingdom.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:19.800]   How many of them are good?
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:22.800]   Zero, okay?
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.800]   What kings should you remember?
[00:32:24.800 --> 00:32:29.800]   Jeroboam I, Boa, okay, Boaam.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.900]   Bahasha, Omri, who did what?
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.560]   He established Samaria, okay?
[00:32:38.560 --> 00:32:40.160]   First Kings 16, 24.
[00:32:40.160 --> 00:32:44.620]   And then Ahab, who's Omri's son.
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:47.460]   See, these great powerful kings who established stuff,
[00:32:47.460 --> 00:32:51.200]   their sons basically get hooked up
[00:32:51.200 --> 00:32:53.460]   and then they sin more, okay?
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:56.260]   So Ahab is the wickedest king,
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:33:00.200]   but he, actually Manasseh and Ammon after him,
[00:33:00.200 --> 00:33:02.600]   they call him even more wicked than Ahab.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.800]   But Ahab is a wicked king.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:05.720]   His dad is who?
[00:33:05.720 --> 00:33:08.020]   Omri, what did Omri do?
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:10.620]   Just think Shamamria, okay?
[00:33:10.620 --> 00:33:13.520]   Or just Omri, okay?
[00:33:13.520 --> 00:33:19.520]   And the Samaria is named after a guy named Shamar, right?
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:22.160]   He bought two talents of silver, he bought it.
[00:33:22.160 --> 00:33:24.220]   And so we don't know why he named it
[00:33:24.220 --> 00:33:27.760]   after the owner of that hill, but Omri did, okay?
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:33.660]   Boaam, Bahasha, Omri, Ahab, and then the last one,
[00:33:33.660 --> 00:33:44.560]   Jeroboam, oh, and then the last one, Hosea.
[00:33:44.560 --> 00:33:48.520]   He was the one who basically got destroyed by Assyria.
[00:33:48.520 --> 00:33:49.360]   All right?
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:57.520]   Now, we're gonna look at the book of Esther, okay?
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:01.560]   (chuckles)
[00:34:01.560 --> 00:34:03.420]   What is she stirring with?
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:05.620]   An S.
[00:34:05.620 --> 00:34:07.880]   So it's an Esther.
[00:34:07.880 --> 00:34:10.800]   All right?
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:16.860]   There's a Persian cat there, Persian curtains,
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:19.060]   and a Persian rug.
[00:34:19.060 --> 00:34:20.760]   What do you think Esther's about?
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:22.560]   Life in Persia.
[00:34:22.560 --> 00:34:24.420]   And just as a quick factoid,
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:28.700]   this book actually should be called Hadassah,
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:29.900]   the book of Hadassah.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.420]   But why is it called Esther?
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:38.100]   What culture do you think the name Esther is derived from?
[00:34:38.100 --> 00:34:41.140]   It's a Persian name, meaning star.
[00:34:41.140 --> 00:34:44.740]   It's all of that, like Jonah, Micah, Nahum, Habakkuk,
[00:34:44.740 --> 00:34:47.700]   Zephaniah, Haggai, Zechariah, those are all Jewish names.
[00:34:47.700 --> 00:34:50.440]   But you get Esther in here as a Persian name
[00:34:50.440 --> 00:34:53.620]   because she was that famous, okay?
[00:34:53.620 --> 00:34:58.620]   So just think Esther and everything Persian.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:35:02.940]   And this book is interesting
[00:35:02.940 --> 00:35:06.080]   because there is no mention of God at all in the whole book.
[00:35:06.080 --> 00:35:08.940]   How many mentions of God?
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:09.780]   Zero.
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:13.820]   The only book of the entire Bible where God is ignored
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:15.400]   or not mentioned at all.
[00:35:15.400 --> 00:35:17.340]   Okay?
[00:35:17.340 --> 00:35:18.160]   There's no mention of God.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:25.620]   This was the book that was of great comfort
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:33.260]   to the Jews during the time of the Holocaust.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:35.160]   So they read and quoted from this book.
[00:35:35.160 --> 00:35:38.940]   And what's also interesting is,
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.780]   remember, King-King split, A, B, C, D, Medo,
[00:35:41.780 --> 00:35:45.780]   Persians returns, three raves, right?
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:47.540]   And Greeks.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:48.460]   This is about the people
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.360]   who didn't go back to build Jerusalem.
[00:35:50.360 --> 00:35:54.460]   These are the less godly people who decided,
[00:35:54.460 --> 00:35:56.660]   nah, eh, no thank you very much.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:58.700]   It's kind of like saying this.
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:00.300]   Some of you guys are from Korean descent,
[00:36:00.300 --> 00:36:02.060]   some of you guys are of Chinese descent.
[00:36:02.060 --> 00:36:05.060]   It's kind of like saying your great-grandma says,
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.180]   we need to go back to our hometown
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:10.800]   to rebuild our family's legacy.
[00:36:10.800 --> 00:36:12.600]   Would you guys wanna go back or no?
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:15.900]   Heck no, I'm not going back.
[00:36:15.900 --> 00:36:17.540]   You know, like why?
[00:36:17.540 --> 00:36:18.360]   Right?
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:21.960]   That was the mentality of the people.
[00:36:21.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   Because for 70 years, Persia was all they knew.
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:29.420]   So I don't even speak Hebrew.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:32.720]   Why do I need to go back?
[00:36:32.720 --> 00:36:34.020]   I like it here.
[00:36:34.020 --> 00:36:37.380]   I have a nice skewer business going on here.
[00:36:37.380 --> 00:36:39.340]   Okay, I don't need to go back.
[00:36:39.340 --> 00:36:43.380]   Only 50,000 people went back, 49,687 of them.
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.140]   Okay, 49,687 of them went back.
[00:36:46.140 --> 00:36:49.680]   Everybody else stayed back in Persia.
[00:36:49.680 --> 00:36:54.360]   Among whom was Mordecai, Esther's uncle, or Hadassah's uncle.
[00:36:54.360 --> 00:36:57.500]   Okay, so Esther's about what?
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.200]   Esther's stirring, it's all about life in Persia,
[00:37:03.200 --> 00:37:06.180]   and Esther is famous because a lot of Bible stories,
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:08.160]   children's Bible stories have that in there.
[00:37:08.160 --> 00:37:10.280]   Okay, and I'm gonna pause here a little bit.
[00:37:10.280 --> 00:37:14.580]   You guys know this, 5-12, 5-5-12, 5-12, 5-5-12.
[00:37:14.580 --> 00:37:16.040]   What is this?
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.200]   Moses.
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:19.800]   History.
[00:37:19.800 --> 00:37:23.640]   Esther's the last history book, got it?
[00:37:23.640 --> 00:37:27.160]   So we've gone over what every book
[00:37:27.160 --> 00:37:30.240]   of the first two categories is about.
[00:37:30.240 --> 00:37:32.520]   We went over all of Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[00:37:32.520 --> 00:37:36.040]   Deuteronomy, and we just covered last week and this week,
[00:37:36.040 --> 00:37:38.280]   Joshua, Judges, Ruth, 1 and 2 Samuel, 1 and 2 Kings,
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:42.200]   1 and 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:43.040]   Okay?
[00:37:44.120 --> 00:37:48.440]   So Pentateuch, History, Poetry, Major Prophets,
[00:37:48.440 --> 00:37:50.480]   and Minor Prophets.
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:53.620]   So we have Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers,
[00:37:53.620 --> 00:37:55.360]   and Deuteronomy, we covered those things.
[00:37:55.360 --> 00:37:57.020]   And you guys remember, nod your heads
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:58.560]   if you remember what they are about.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:38:00.520]   If I give you a test right now,
[00:38:00.520 --> 00:38:03.380]   and if you pass this test with flying colors,
[00:38:03.380 --> 00:38:06.000]   you get a boba, if you don't, you get punched in the face.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:07.760]   Would you guys be able to pass this test?
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:08.960]   Yeah, okay?
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:11.560]   Next 12, Joshua, what's that about?
[00:38:11.560 --> 00:38:15.840]   Conquest, Judges, Cycles, Ruth,
[00:38:15.840 --> 00:38:18.720]   love story in the Book of Judges, or time of Judges,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:22.440]   1 Samuel, David, Saul, right?
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:27.440]   2 Samuel, David, 1 Kings, Solomon, 2 Kings,
[00:38:27.440 --> 00:38:31.000]   divided kingdom, it starts with Elisha, right?
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:32.880]   The story just starts with Elisha.
[00:38:32.880 --> 00:38:37.120]   1 Chronicles, he's holding one newspaper with the star,
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.840]   David, and then the second Chronicles,
[00:38:38.840 --> 00:38:40.880]   about the Jews, Judah.
[00:38:40.880 --> 00:38:45.200]   Ezra is about, and how much time do you think
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:48.040]   has elapsed between 2 Chronicles, chapter 36,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.720]   and Ezra, chapter one?
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:53.040]   70 years, 'cause they're all in captivity, okay?
[00:38:53.040 --> 00:38:56.120]   Nehemiah is about the wall around the city
[00:38:56.120 --> 00:38:56.960]   because they're trying to build
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:59.160]   but everyone keeps messing up the projects, right?
[00:38:59.160 --> 00:39:01.960]   Ah, I just built the pillar, whoosh,
[00:39:01.960 --> 00:39:03.400]   oh, they gotta start all over.
[00:39:03.400 --> 00:39:05.800]   So obviously they're discouraged.
[00:39:05.800 --> 00:39:08.200]   So because they're discouraged, they stop building
[00:39:08.200 --> 00:39:09.640]   and they just kinda carry on with their lives
[00:39:09.640 --> 00:39:11.920]   and Haggai comes out all strong, dude,
[00:39:11.920 --> 00:39:14.160]   and Zechariah comes all strong, right?
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:16.480]   Is it a time for you to live in these paddled houses
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.280]   while the house of God remains a ruin?
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.960]   They're like, geez, then at least protect us
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.400]   from the peoples or something.
[00:39:22.400 --> 00:39:24.920]   So the people have a legitimate gripe
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:26.560]   because they don't realize yet
[00:39:26.560 --> 00:39:27.900]   that the righteous will live by faith,
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.840]   but they're just, ah, right?
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:33.640]   So Ezra and Nehemiah are almost together
[00:39:33.640 --> 00:39:36.580]   and those are the returns, and Esther is,
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:39.880]   something that happens during the time of the returns
[00:39:39.880 --> 00:39:43.480]   but up north still 'cause they didn't come back.
[00:39:43.480 --> 00:39:44.720]   You guys following me?
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.600]   Okay, so, and Esther is much later.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   It's chronologically one of the last books
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.380]   of the Old Testament, chronologically,
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:53.420]   but it's right smack in the middle.
[00:39:53.420 --> 00:39:55.580]   That's why I'll get confused, and Job is the first one.
[00:39:55.580 --> 00:39:57.240]   So it'll mess you up.
[00:39:57.240 --> 00:40:00.800]   And today we're gonna cover Job, Psalms, Proverbs,
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:01.920]   Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon.
[00:40:01.920 --> 00:40:02.760]   These should be easier
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:04.940]   because you're probably already familiar with them.
[00:40:04.940 --> 00:40:07.960]   So I'm gonna go through them pretty quickly.
[00:40:07.960 --> 00:40:10.740]   This guy's name is Job, okay?
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:12.600]   I was like, this is a disappointing picture
[00:40:12.600 --> 00:40:14.560]   'cause it doesn't really tell you how his name comes to be,
[00:40:14.560 --> 00:40:15.980]   but just remember this guy's suffering.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:17.440]   Okay, poor dude.
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:19.740]   The thing is about the sovereign hands of God.
[00:40:19.740 --> 00:40:22.440]   Although there's only one hand in the picture,
[00:40:22.440 --> 00:40:24.760]   just, you guys get my point, all right?
[00:40:24.760 --> 00:40:27.220]   God's sovereignty in the midst of suffering.
[00:40:27.220 --> 00:40:31.980]   God's sovereignty in the midst of suffering.
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:36.980]   And this is a book of Psalms, okay?
[00:40:36.980 --> 00:40:44.440]   What's one palm doing?
[00:40:44.440 --> 00:40:48.620]   Singing, and the other one is doing what?
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:51.400]   His hands are like this.
[00:40:51.400 --> 00:40:53.760]   That's hard to see.
[00:40:53.760 --> 00:40:55.040]   He's praying, okay?
[00:40:55.040 --> 00:40:56.400]   Or you could look down at your picture.
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:41:00.480]   There's one who's singing praises.
[00:41:00.480 --> 00:41:04.420]   The other one who's praying prayers.
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:07.460]   So the Psalm, palms, Psalms,
[00:41:07.460 --> 00:41:09.160]   they're about praises and prayers.
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.500]   What's Esther about?
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:16.700]   Persia, Job, sovereign hands.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   It's not about suffering.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.900]   It's about what?
[00:41:18.900 --> 00:41:20.340]   God's sovereignty.
[00:41:20.340 --> 00:41:24.500]   Satan has to ask God's permission, right?
[00:41:24.500 --> 00:41:26.980]   And it's all about God allowing it.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:31.560]   So it has nothing to do with like merited suffering.
[00:41:31.560 --> 00:41:33.760]   It's about the sovereignty of God.
[00:41:33.760 --> 00:41:37.380]   Psalms was about two things, praise and prayer.
[00:41:37.380 --> 00:41:41.480]   Coincidentally, what do we have this Friday?
[00:41:41.480 --> 00:41:42.320]   Praise and prayer.
[00:41:42.320 --> 00:41:44.080]   So try to read Psalms 1 through 150
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:47.160]   by the end of this week in preparation,
[00:41:47.160 --> 00:41:48.720]   and you'll be adequately prepared.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:49.560]   Next one.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:52.420]   Proverbs is an English word,
[00:41:52.420 --> 00:41:54.600]   so you don't need to think too hard on it.
[00:41:54.600 --> 00:41:55.740]   A fool and his money.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.720]   But this is about Proverbs.
[00:41:59.720 --> 00:42:02.060]   It's God honoring life skills and wisdom.
[00:42:02.060 --> 00:42:06.640]   One thing you'll know about the Proverbs
[00:42:06.640 --> 00:42:08.340]   is not about how people come
[00:42:08.340 --> 00:42:10.320]   to earn the righteousness of God.
[00:42:10.320 --> 00:42:13.540]   The Proverbs is not about how to be saved.
[00:42:13.540 --> 00:42:17.280]   And it's not about morality.
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:24.800]   The Proverbs are about how God's people
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:28.200]   should live.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:31.940]   Proverbs basically means life skills.
[00:42:31.940 --> 00:42:36.540]   That's why when I talk to parents,
[00:42:36.540 --> 00:42:39.480]   I tell them be very careful
[00:42:39.480 --> 00:42:42.060]   when you teach Proverbs to your children.
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:44.500]   Be very careful when you tell them
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:46.860]   to memorize the Proverbs.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:49.260]   It's not that it's not applicable to children
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.820]   because Solomon wrote it to his children.
[00:42:51.820 --> 00:42:53.860]   Okay, I mean grown children probably.
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:57.080]   But you teach your kids wrong,
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:42:59.360]   and they can do the Proverbs right,
[00:42:59.360 --> 00:43:01.260]   they might trick themselves into thinking
[00:43:01.260 --> 00:43:03.240]   that they're religious and they're upright.
[00:43:03.240 --> 00:43:06.280]   So Proverbs is actually a dangerous book to teach
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:08.880]   because it emphasizes morality.
[00:43:08.880 --> 00:43:13.320]   And you shouldn't try to come up with
[00:43:13.320 --> 00:43:16.340]   life applications of what Christians must do
[00:43:16.340 --> 00:43:17.360]   from the Proverbs.
[00:43:17.360 --> 00:43:19.920]   Proverbs is all about what a Christian,
[00:43:19.920 --> 00:43:23.440]   what a God honoring man ought to look like.
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:25.540]   You guys see the slight difference?
[00:43:25.540 --> 00:43:26.960]   It's easy, if you're not careful,
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:29.000]   it's easy to swing this way and be like,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:34.580]   hey, beloved daughter or beloved son, okay?
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:39.000]   I've memorized a bunch of Proverbs,
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:42.100]   but none of them is sticking in my head right now.
[00:43:42.100 --> 00:43:46.200]   Okay, you guys know what I'm saying, right?
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:49.560]   Okay. (audience laughing)
[00:43:49.560 --> 00:43:52.840]   So a Proverbs is life skills.
[00:43:52.840 --> 00:43:55.480]   And it's not about how to please God.
[00:43:55.480 --> 00:44:01.320]   Okay, it's about how wisdom makes your life
[00:44:01.320 --> 00:44:03.480]   reflect God's goodness.
[00:44:03.480 --> 00:44:05.600]   Not do this and please God.
[00:44:05.600 --> 00:44:10.640]   So be careful when you quote the Proverbs as prescriptives.
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:13.440]   The next one is Ecclesiastes,
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:15.120]   and what do you see in this picture?
[00:44:15.120 --> 00:44:18.480]   Compared to all the other pictures, this is just nothing.
[00:44:18.480 --> 00:44:21.860]   Okay, Ecclesiastes is all about emptiness and vanity.
[00:44:22.860 --> 00:44:24.060]   Emptiness and vanity.
[00:44:24.060 --> 00:44:37.540]   Okay, Ecclesiastes, emptiness and vanity, moving forward.
[00:44:37.540 --> 00:44:42.980]   Who's this?
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:48.900]   Remember the king who's half-hearted, singing,
[00:44:48.900 --> 00:44:51.980]   or actually, he has, but this one, there's one wife.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:55.940]   Okay, so it's a Song of Solomon.
[00:44:55.940 --> 00:44:59.980]   It's all about the beauty of love in a marriage covenant.
[00:44:59.980 --> 00:45:02.220]   It's a beauty of love in a marriage covenant.
[00:45:02.220 --> 00:45:08.580]   Is it?
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:12.580]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:12.580 --> 00:45:15.060]   Page 15 is missing.
[00:45:15.060 --> 00:45:15.900]   Is it page 15 is missing?
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:24.060]   Okay, well, I'll email this to you.
[00:45:24.060 --> 00:45:27.460]   Oh, this page is missing?
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:33.780]   Okay, that's a complete, that's a Xerox machine error.
[00:45:33.780 --> 00:45:35.220]   Who has it?
[00:45:35.220 --> 00:45:37.580]   Oh, okay.
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:40.380]   'Cause I even had the machine staple it,
[00:45:40.380 --> 00:45:43.500]   so I guess it just skipped it, okay?
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:44.340]   But I'll email it to you.
[00:45:44.340 --> 00:45:48.460]   Email me, or like, actually, don't email me.
[00:45:48.460 --> 00:45:51.180]   I'll just put it up, okay, somewhere,
[00:45:51.180 --> 00:45:53.220]   on the Berean Facebook page or something.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:56.500]   Song of Solomon, beauty of love in a marriage covenant.
[00:45:56.500 --> 00:46:00.260]   Now, what I wanna do before you guys break up into part two
[00:46:00.260 --> 00:46:03.100]   is to find a partner and go over these now,
[00:46:03.100 --> 00:46:05.700]   that you guys are a little bit more familiar
[00:46:05.700 --> 00:46:09.300]   with what goes up until 7/22, all right?
[00:46:09.300 --> 00:46:11.180]   So find a partner.
[00:46:11.180 --> 00:46:12.700]   This helps to reinforce.
[00:46:12.700 --> 00:46:14.900]   Like, some of you guys are like, I am so antisocial.
[00:46:14.900 --> 00:46:17.180]   Why do you make me do this every week?
[00:46:17.180 --> 00:46:18.700]   Be social, okay?
[00:46:18.700 --> 00:46:20.380]   Consider how to stimulate one another
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:21.380]   toward love and good deeds,
[00:46:21.380 --> 00:46:23.500]   or to growing in the Old Testament.
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:25.180]   So whoever you're partnered with,
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:27.580]   just give 'em a big smile, give 'em a fist bump or a hug,
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.860]   and be like, let's do this, okay?
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:32.260]   And so, and go over these,
[00:46:32.260 --> 00:46:36.700]   and then we'll take a little bit of a break until 11.30.
[00:46:36.700 --> 00:46:39.860]   (audience chattering)
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.020]   (audience chattering)
[00:46:44.020 --> 00:46:47.180]   (audience chattering)
[00:46:47.180 --> 00:46:50.340]   (audience chattering)
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:53.500]   (audience chattering)
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:58.660]   (audience chattering)
[00:46:58.660 --> 00:47:05.220]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:15.420]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:15.420 --> 00:47:18.580]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:18.580 --> 00:47:26.140]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:26.140 --> 00:47:35.940]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:35.940 --> 00:47:39.100]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:39.100 --> 00:47:50.980]   (audience chattering)
[00:47:50.980 --> 00:48:03.900]   (audience chattering)
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:07.060]   (audience chattering)
[00:48:07.060 --> 00:48:31.780]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:31.780 --> 00:48:34.940]   (audience chattering)
[00:48:34.940 --> 00:48:38.100]   (audience chattering)
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:52.180]   (audience laughing)
[00:48:52.180 --> 00:48:57.860]   (audience chattering)
[00:48:57.860 --> 00:49:01.020]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:01.620 --> 00:49:04.780]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:04.780 --> 00:49:07.940]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:08.060 --> 00:49:11.220]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:11.220 --> 00:49:32.700]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:36.860]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:36.860 --> 00:49:55.180]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:55.180 --> 00:49:58.340]   (audience chattering)
[00:49:58.340 --> 00:50:01.500]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.660]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:07.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:08.660 --> 00:50:11.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:11.820 --> 00:50:19.340]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:19.340 --> 00:50:28.500]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:31.660]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:32.660 --> 00:50:35.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:50:35.820 --> 00:51:00.660]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:00.660 --> 00:51:03.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:03.820 --> 00:51:06.980]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:06.980 --> 00:51:15.340]   (audience laughing)
[00:51:15.340 --> 00:51:20.220]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:21.060 --> 00:51:24.220]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:25.220 --> 00:51:28.380]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:28.380 --> 00:51:31.540]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:31.540 --> 00:51:46.980]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:46.980 --> 00:51:50.140]   (audience chattering)
[00:51:50.140 --> 00:52:12.900]   (audience laughing)
[00:52:13.460 --> 00:52:16.620]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:17.580 --> 00:52:20.740]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:20.740 --> 00:52:23.900]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:23.900 --> 00:52:27.060]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:27.060 --> 00:52:30.220]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:30.220 --> 00:52:33.380]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:33.380 --> 00:52:36.540]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:36.540 --> 00:52:51.980]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:51.980 --> 00:52:55.140]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:55.140 --> 00:52:58.300]   (audience chattering)
[00:52:58.660 --> 00:53:01.820]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:01.820 --> 00:53:04.980]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:04.980 --> 00:53:08.140]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:08.140 --> 00:53:11.300]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:11.300 --> 00:53:14.460]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:14.460 --> 00:53:24.860]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:24.860 --> 00:53:36.380]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:36.380 --> 00:53:39.540]   (audience chattering)
[00:53:39.540 --> 00:54:02.420]   - Okay, one more minute.
[00:54:02.420 --> 00:54:05.580]   (audience chattering)
[00:54:05.580 --> 00:54:20.700]   (singing in foreign language)
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:31.380]   45 more seconds, 45 more seconds, 40 more seconds.
[00:54:32.180 --> 00:54:35.340]   (audience chattering)
[00:54:35.340 --> 00:54:55.580]   All right, 15 more seconds.
[00:54:55.580 --> 00:54:58.740]   (audience chattering)
[00:54:58.740 --> 00:55:09.180]   So raise your hand if you feel like
[00:55:09.180 --> 00:55:12.380]   the person you tested just a couple minutes back
[00:55:12.380 --> 00:55:17.420]   would be a very good candidate to be a special TA
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:20.220]   if we do the Old Testament survey again, raise your hand.
[00:55:20.220 --> 00:55:22.860]   You guys, they got it down?
[00:55:25.340 --> 00:55:30.340]   Okay, we're gonna continue with the next two books,
[00:55:30.340 --> 00:55:33.940]   and after today, you'll have 24 of the Old Testament books
[00:55:33.940 --> 00:55:37.780]   thematically kind of in your head.
[00:55:37.780 --> 00:55:40.540]   This "I" is saying "uh," okay?
[00:55:40.540 --> 00:55:45.100]   So this picture is an "I say uh," "I say uh."
[00:55:45.100 --> 00:55:48.420]   But the dude in the middle, what's he doing?
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:50.900]   He's weeping.
[00:55:52.860 --> 00:55:57.220]   But the dude on the end is doing a exaltation.
[00:55:57.220 --> 00:55:59.580]   He's like, "Ah," okay?
[00:55:59.580 --> 00:56:02.940]   So the guy is both weeping,
[00:56:02.940 --> 00:56:05.180]   and then another guy is rejoicing.
[00:56:05.180 --> 00:56:08.420]   Do you guys remember how you remember
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:10.300]   the Old and New Testament books?
[00:56:10.300 --> 00:56:15.860]   Three times nine equals 27.
[00:56:15.860 --> 00:56:20.620]   39 old, 27 new, total 66.
[00:56:20.620 --> 00:56:22.700]   Isaiah has 66 chapters.
[00:56:22.700 --> 00:56:28.340]   And wouldn't you know it, it breaks down into 39 chapters
[00:56:28.340 --> 00:56:29.580]   and then the latter 27.
[00:56:29.580 --> 00:56:33.140]   If you actually look at your Bible, you see that division.
[00:56:33.140 --> 00:56:35.940]   Okay, God divinely orchestrated the book of Isaiah
[00:56:35.940 --> 00:56:39.780]   to be divided this way so that in January 2019,
[00:56:39.780 --> 00:56:42.580]   our Old Testament survey class could have easy
[00:56:42.580 --> 00:56:46.140]   remembering or memorizing access to this book.
[00:56:46.140 --> 00:56:47.940]   His word is perfect, okay?
[00:56:47.940 --> 00:56:51.100]   39 chapters is all about the sorrow
[00:56:51.100 --> 00:56:54.340]   that has befallen God's people because of sin.
[00:56:54.340 --> 00:56:58.060]   Mostly about just sorrow, 39,
[00:56:58.060 --> 00:57:00.820]   about the ruined people of God.
[00:57:00.820 --> 00:57:07.620]   But 40 to 66, the last 27 chapters is really about
[00:57:07.620 --> 00:57:14.340]   future rejoicing that comes when a Messiah appears.
[00:57:17.780 --> 00:57:18.620]   Yes.
[00:57:18.620 --> 00:57:22.380]   Ah, thank you.
[00:57:22.380 --> 00:57:23.980]   Who needs page 15?
[00:57:23.980 --> 00:57:31.340]   Okay, so Isaiah weeping for 39 chapters,
[00:57:31.340 --> 00:57:35.540]   rejoicing the latter 27.
[00:57:35.540 --> 00:57:38.140]   Breaks down nicely, right?
[00:57:38.140 --> 00:57:42.380]   Because the suffering servant is gonna come, right?
[00:57:42.380 --> 00:57:47.380]   By his chase, or who, the chastening of our sin
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:52.420]   our reconciliation fell upon him
[00:57:52.420 --> 00:57:58.100]   and by his scourging we are healed in Isaiah 53, five.
[00:57:58.100 --> 00:58:02.100]   Okay, so Isaiah is all about weeping,
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:06.060]   followed up with rejoicing
[00:58:06.060 --> 00:58:08.420]   through the Messiah that is to come.
[00:58:08.420 --> 00:58:12.580]   Isaiah also writes about the Medo-Persians
[00:58:12.580 --> 00:58:15.420]   who are gonna come and he actually names Cyrus
[00:58:15.420 --> 00:58:16.740]   by name in chapter 45.
[00:58:17.540 --> 00:58:18.900]   But Isaiah's written 200 years
[00:58:18.900 --> 00:58:20.660]   before the Medo-Persians came up.
[00:58:20.660 --> 00:58:25.300]   So Cyrus wasn't even cellular at this point, okay?
[00:58:25.300 --> 00:58:29.460]   So Isaiah prophecies that Cyrus,
[00:58:29.460 --> 00:58:31.980]   the one who is serving at the right hand of God
[00:58:31.980 --> 00:58:34.140]   will come and deliver his people.
[00:58:34.140 --> 00:58:36.300]   So if you actually date the book of Isaiah
[00:58:36.300 --> 00:58:38.380]   and you see historically what happens
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:40.860]   with the Medo-Persians, it's amazing
[00:58:40.860 --> 00:58:45.500]   how many prophecies come to pass, okay?
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:51.500]   Next we have a jury, Maya, jury Maya, okay?
[00:58:51.500 --> 00:58:59.500]   And Jeremiah is holding something.
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.140]   What is this?
[00:59:02.140 --> 00:59:07.380]   The NASB calls it a waistband.
[00:59:07.380 --> 00:59:12.340]   KJV calls it a girdle.
[00:59:12.340 --> 00:59:14.500]   The ESV calls it a loincloth.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   The NIV calls it a belt.
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:21.060]   I call it a sash, okay?
[00:59:21.060 --> 00:59:22.500]   It doesn't matter.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:27.420]   It's a piece of clothing that basically held stuff together
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:29.980]   in the Old Testament.
[00:59:29.980 --> 00:59:32.980]   God says in Jeremiah, I think it's chapter 13.
[00:59:32.980 --> 00:59:35.940]   He tells Jeremiah in chapter, I think chapter 13.
[00:59:35.940 --> 00:59:40.940]   Jeremiah 13, God tells Jeremiah to go to the Euphrates River
[00:59:41.060 --> 00:59:46.060]   and take this waistband, loincloth, girdle, sash, belt
[00:59:46.060 --> 00:59:48.460]   and hide it in a cleft of a rock.
[00:59:48.460 --> 00:59:52.540]   And then, oh it is Jeremiah 13.
[00:59:52.540 --> 00:59:55.260]   Verse five, he goes and he does that.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:58.980]   And verse six, it says, after many days,
[00:59:58.980 --> 01:00:02.860]   God says, arise, go to the Euphrates
[01:00:02.860 --> 01:00:06.780]   and take the waistband which I told you to hide there.
[01:00:06.780 --> 01:00:10.340]   And it is like stinky and messed up and disgusting.
[01:00:11.340 --> 01:00:13.340]   Okay, and that he says is the picture
[01:00:13.340 --> 01:00:15.780]   of the rottenness of Judah.
[01:00:15.780 --> 01:00:18.140]   Not Israel, of who?
[01:00:18.140 --> 01:00:20.460]   Judah, Israel's gone, okay?
[01:00:20.460 --> 01:00:24.340]   My people of Judah are rotten to the core
[01:00:24.340 --> 01:00:27.060]   like this beautiful, once beautiful belt,
[01:00:27.060 --> 01:00:31.380]   sash, waistband, girdle, loincloth, okay?
[01:00:31.380 --> 01:00:36.380]   So Isaiah is about 3927, weeping and rejoicing.
[01:00:36.860 --> 01:00:41.300]   Jeremiah is about Judah being like a rotten sash.
[01:00:41.300 --> 01:00:44.860]   That's why Jeremiah weeps.
[01:00:44.860 --> 01:00:46.460]   And he gets thrown into prison.
[01:00:46.460 --> 01:00:49.900]   And you actually see the latter historical Judean kings
[01:00:49.900 --> 01:00:52.460]   come up and mistreat him a lot.
[01:00:52.460 --> 01:00:55.740]   Okay, so once we memorize Kings 16 to 20,
[01:00:55.740 --> 01:00:56.980]   you're gonna actually see them come up
[01:00:56.980 --> 01:00:58.940]   in the book of Jeremiah, okay?
[01:00:58.940 --> 01:01:02.300]   Darius is mentioned in Jeremiah,
[01:01:02.300 --> 01:01:03.860]   Cyrus is mentioned in Jeremiah,
[01:01:03.860 --> 01:01:05.660]   Nebuchadnezzar is mentioned in Jeremiah.
[01:01:05.660 --> 01:01:08.980]   So all these names are gonna start being familiar to you.
[01:01:08.980 --> 01:01:11.500]   Now, who is his king?
[01:01:11.500 --> 01:01:17.620]   King Rehoboam, number six, Ahaziah.
[01:01:17.620 --> 01:01:20.540]   There's another Ahaziah in the north,
[01:01:20.540 --> 01:01:22.060]   but different guy, right?
[01:01:22.060 --> 01:01:26.380]   The first guy, King 11 is Jotham.
[01:01:26.380 --> 01:01:30.020]   King 16 is Josiah, okay?
[01:01:30.020 --> 01:01:30.860]   King Rehoboam.
[01:01:32.420 --> 01:01:35.860]   Now, remember Kings one through five,
[01:01:35.860 --> 01:01:40.860]   dirty Solomon, Rehoboam's, Abba's, Gigi, okay?
[01:01:40.860 --> 01:01:47.100]   We saw that Rehoboam was number one,
[01:01:47.100 --> 01:01:52.100]   Abijah two, Asa three, Jehoshaphat four, Jehoram five.
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:54.220]   And if you have a little bit of time
[01:01:54.220 --> 01:01:56.740]   and you wanna become a legit gourmet Bible nerd,
[01:01:56.740 --> 01:01:59.340]   memorize the dates, 'cause they will help you, okay?
[01:02:02.300 --> 01:02:06.260]   Now, this six through 10 took me an hour and a half,
[01:02:06.260 --> 01:02:08.220]   'cause I was trying so hard to find a way
[01:02:08.220 --> 01:02:11.420]   that would make any kind of sense, but I couldn't, okay?
[01:02:11.420 --> 01:02:14.260]   So you just have to bear with me on this one, all right?
[01:02:14.260 --> 01:02:19.260]   So, this lady has crazy eyelashes, okay?
[01:02:19.260 --> 01:02:23.260]   And I put this on there for you, right?
[01:02:23.260 --> 01:02:29.300]   Aha, the queen's lashes are amazing,
[01:02:29.300 --> 01:02:31.900]   like Uzi's or something, I don't know, okay?
[01:02:32.380 --> 01:02:37.380]   So, to give you a visual, I put Uzi's eyelashes, okay?
[01:02:37.380 --> 01:02:45.900]   Stare at it, just stare at it, just stare at it.
[01:02:45.900 --> 01:02:50.900]   So hopefully, it's like, aha, the queen's lashes
[01:02:50.900 --> 01:02:55.540]   are amazing, like Uzi's or something, all right?
[01:02:55.540 --> 01:02:58.660]   Just give me a break on this one, I really could not,
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:00.420]   'cause there's another Jeho guy,
[01:03:00.420 --> 01:03:03.740]   and then there's like, so this one was hard, okay?
[01:03:03.740 --> 01:03:07.140]   So I was thinking like, Athalia, thy lashes.
[01:03:07.140 --> 01:03:09.380]   Forget it, I just do it this way, okay?
[01:03:09.380 --> 01:03:10.580]   This one's easy enough to remember
[01:03:10.580 --> 01:03:12.700]   if you guys try hard enough, right?
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.700]   Aha, the queen's lashes equals amazing Uzi's.
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:23.820]   You guys ever learn my very educated mother
[01:03:23.820 --> 01:03:26.260]   just sent us nine pizzas, anybody know what that was?
[01:03:26.260 --> 01:03:29.180]   Or kings play chess on funny green squares?
[01:03:29.180 --> 01:03:30.700]   Do you guys remember those things?
[01:03:30.700 --> 01:03:32.660]   Kingdom, phylum, genus, you know, all that stuff,
[01:03:32.660 --> 01:03:34.940]   and then the Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter.
[01:03:34.940 --> 01:03:36.740]   So just think of this as one of those,
[01:03:36.740 --> 01:03:41.740]   that makes no sense, but aha, the queen's lashes
[01:03:41.740 --> 01:03:47.060]   are like amazing Uzi's, I'm so sorry.
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:50.020]   (laughing)
[01:03:50.020 --> 01:03:52.020]   I don't know how else I do it.
[01:03:52.020 --> 01:03:57.020]   So, first one, aha, Athalia, okay?
[01:03:57.900 --> 01:04:01.820]   Ahaziah, second one is a queen.
[01:04:01.820 --> 01:04:07.860]   That's Ahaziah's mom, okay?
[01:04:07.860 --> 01:04:13.140]   Ahaziah's mom, Ahaziah was king from 841 to 841, he died.
[01:04:13.140 --> 01:04:19.700]   So his mama was not happy.
[01:04:19.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   So she tried to kill everybody in the royal line, okay?
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.980]   And have her side of the family take over,
[01:04:26.980 --> 01:04:29.900]   'cause she's not, her son was part of the royal line,
[01:04:29.900 --> 01:04:31.460]   but she's from the outside.
[01:04:31.460 --> 01:04:33.260]   So she was trying to kill everybody.
[01:04:33.260 --> 01:04:36.940]   So she actually was queen over Judah for six years.
[01:04:36.940 --> 01:04:42.620]   But she couldn't hunt down one last guy, who was a baby.
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:48.380]   Because the high priest at the time,
[01:04:48.380 --> 01:04:51.460]   knowing the commandment of God, snatched the baby,
[01:04:51.460 --> 01:04:54.540]   ran into the temple, and hid him there for six years.
[01:04:54.540 --> 01:04:57.380]   The last place the queen would look would be that temple.
[01:04:57.380 --> 01:05:02.380]   But the priest hid him in the temple until he was seven.
[01:05:02.380 --> 01:05:06.580]   And he was the very first child king.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:08.340]   Josiah is a more famous one,
[01:05:08.340 --> 01:05:10.400]   but he was the very first child king.
[01:05:10.400 --> 01:05:16.420]   So that's Jehoash for lash, okay?
[01:05:16.420 --> 01:05:18.220]   'Cause if I give you another Jeho,
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.860]   you guys probably be like, oh man, there's so many.
[01:05:20.860 --> 01:05:23.500]   Okay, so this one is Jehoash, okay?
[01:05:23.500 --> 01:05:24.700]   There's no guarantee that next week's
[01:05:24.700 --> 01:05:26.500]   is gonna be any more memorable.
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.940]   But just this one is the Uzis, okay?
[01:05:28.940 --> 01:05:33.740]   Aha, the queen's lashes are amazing.
[01:05:33.740 --> 01:05:38.820]   Uzis, I'm so sorry, okay?
[01:05:38.820 --> 01:05:41.860]   Amaziah and Uziah.
[01:05:41.860 --> 01:05:44.700]   Little bit of information about him.
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:50.660]   Ahaziah, he reigned just in 841, he died.
[01:05:51.820 --> 01:05:55.580]   He's a bad king, and he was assassinated by a guy named Jehu.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:58.060]   Jehu is like a warrior, he kills all kinds of people
[01:05:58.060 --> 01:05:59.380]   in the north and the south.
[01:05:59.380 --> 01:06:00.980]   But he's assassinated by Jehu.
[01:06:00.980 --> 01:06:09.140]   Queen Athaliah, she's bad.
[01:06:09.140 --> 01:06:17.340]   And she's executed by Jehoiada, the priest.
[01:06:19.780 --> 01:06:22.580]   There's another Jehoiada later that is to come,
[01:06:22.580 --> 01:06:24.580]   and he's also a high priest.
[01:06:24.580 --> 01:06:26.220]   But that dude is not a good guy.
[01:06:26.220 --> 01:06:28.540]   This Jehoiada is good.
[01:06:28.540 --> 01:06:31.540]   He's the one who taught Jehoash the word of the Lord, okay?
[01:06:31.540 --> 01:06:38.340]   And Jehoiada was like, the king has returned.
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:40.380]   And this little kid is in like this giant crown,
[01:06:40.380 --> 01:06:43.380]   is like, he shows up and then he goes,
[01:06:43.380 --> 01:06:46.460]   she needs to be put to death, Athaliah, okay?
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:50.460]   Number eight is Jehoash.
[01:06:50.460 --> 01:06:55.220]   Proverbs 22, six says, train up a child
[01:06:55.220 --> 01:06:56.460]   in the way he should go, and when he is old,
[01:06:56.460 --> 01:06:57.700]   he will not turn from it.
[01:06:57.700 --> 01:07:00.420]   Where did this boy spend the first six,
[01:07:00.420 --> 01:07:01.660]   seven years of his life?
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:05.460]   At the feet of the high priest
[01:07:05.460 --> 01:07:07.580]   who was teaching him the word of God, okay?
[01:07:07.580 --> 01:07:12.380]   So he actually grows up to reign as a pretty good king.
[01:07:12.380 --> 01:07:14.940]   And around this time, we're thinking
[01:07:14.940 --> 01:07:16.900]   maybe the book of Joel is written,
[01:07:16.900 --> 01:07:21.580]   but this child king later is assassinated by his officials.
[01:07:21.580 --> 01:07:25.860]   So there's all kinds of assassinations going on
[01:07:25.860 --> 01:07:27.060]   in the Bible, okay?
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:32.060]   So if you want like a good mystery novel,
[01:07:32.060 --> 01:07:35.620]   not a mystery novel, action-packed stuff,
[01:07:35.620 --> 01:07:38.100]   just read the Bible, okay?
[01:07:38.100 --> 01:07:39.700]   Amaziah is the next guy.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:44.140]   He reigned from 796 to 767.
[01:07:44.140 --> 01:07:45.500]   He too was a good king.
[01:07:46.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   So now you have almost all of the good kings,
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:55.260]   minus two or three, that you guys now remember, right?
[01:07:55.260 --> 01:08:00.780]   And this was in the time of a major war with Israel,
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:02.900]   and he too gets assassinated.
[01:08:02.900 --> 01:08:07.260]   And his son, at a young age, Uzziah, becomes king.
[01:08:07.260 --> 01:08:09.140]   Uzziah, people recognize his name
[01:08:09.140 --> 01:08:13.620]   because in the book of Isaiah, it says in chapter six,
[01:08:13.620 --> 01:08:16.420]   where Isaiah sees the vision of God
[01:08:16.420 --> 01:08:18.700]   and the, what do you call it?
[01:08:18.700 --> 01:08:22.060]   In the train of Israel, oh, temple, temple,
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:22.900]   that's the word.
[01:08:22.900 --> 01:08:24.460]   He sees God in his temple,
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:26.300]   and he goes, "In the year King Uzziah died."
[01:08:26.300 --> 01:08:31.300]   King Uzziah had major reforms to the country.
[01:08:31.300 --> 01:08:34.700]   So he was like Jeroboam,
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.260]   and Uzziah was almost at the same time.
[01:08:37.260 --> 01:08:40.260]   Jeroboam number two brought all kinds of revival
[01:08:40.260 --> 01:08:43.340]   and like financially up to the north,
[01:08:43.340 --> 01:08:46.540]   Uzziah did that for the south, okay?
[01:08:46.540 --> 01:08:51.540]   And this was during the golden age of Judah.
[01:08:51.540 --> 01:08:56.380]   So that's why when he dies, Isaiah is really disrupt.
[01:08:56.380 --> 01:08:58.620]   (chuckles)
[01:08:58.620 --> 01:09:14.380]   Okay.
[01:09:14.380 --> 01:09:18.260]   If you need these emailed, just shoot me an email
[01:09:18.260 --> 01:09:19.460]   and I'll send it to you.
[01:09:19.460 --> 01:09:24.140]   Now, I'm gonna move on.
[01:09:24.140 --> 01:09:26.900]   (pages rustling)
[01:09:26.900 --> 01:09:33.180]   Ah, that square's not supposed to be there, but.
[01:09:33.180 --> 01:09:38.660]   Now, this, what you learn today,
[01:09:38.660 --> 01:09:46.020]   it takes up 75% of the Old Testament and half the Bible,
[01:09:46.020 --> 01:09:47.420]   what we learned so far.
[01:09:47.420 --> 01:09:50.860]   So now you can read half the Bible
[01:09:50.860 --> 01:09:52.660]   and not be terrified of it.
[01:09:52.660 --> 01:09:54.780]   75% of the Old Testament, you kind of have
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:56.740]   a framework in your head.
[01:09:56.740 --> 01:09:59.540]   Okay, so that was my hope, okay?
[01:09:59.540 --> 01:10:01.380]   And we still have three more classes.
[01:10:01.380 --> 01:10:05.420]   So do you guys remember this timeline?
[01:10:05.420 --> 01:10:06.260]   Okay.
[01:10:06.260 --> 01:10:09.620]   Do you know what all these stand for?
[01:10:09.620 --> 01:10:11.020]   If I did this the first class, you'd be like,
[01:10:11.020 --> 01:10:13.820]   "What the, it's all these letters."
[01:10:13.820 --> 01:10:16.220]   Okay, what are the A, M, D, and R, and J?
[01:10:16.220 --> 01:10:17.420]   What are those red ones?
[01:10:17.420 --> 01:10:20.700]   The landmarks, right?
[01:10:20.700 --> 01:10:23.780]   How about the T and J in the middle, the green ones?
[01:10:23.780 --> 01:10:26.900]   That's Mount JK.
[01:10:26.900 --> 01:10:31.900]   The blue, K, S, and A, the D and the K are the same, right?
[01:10:31.900 --> 01:10:33.820]   Okay, what are the K, S, and A?
[01:10:33.820 --> 01:10:39.980]   King, split, Assyria, and then the BCD,
[01:10:39.980 --> 01:10:42.460]   it's not the Sundubu place, what is it?
[01:10:42.460 --> 01:10:46.100]   Babylon, captivity, destruction,
[01:10:46.100 --> 01:10:49.140]   Medo-Persians, the returns, R, R, R,
[01:10:49.140 --> 01:10:51.260]   and Greeks is in green.
[01:10:51.260 --> 01:10:52.980]   Now I'm gonna make a big timeline,
[01:10:52.980 --> 01:10:54.620]   and I'm gonna show you today where all the books
[01:10:54.620 --> 01:10:56.700]   of the Old Testament fall in,
[01:10:56.700 --> 01:10:57.620]   and then we'll review it again,
[01:10:57.620 --> 01:11:00.580]   and I'll add more details later, okay?
[01:11:00.580 --> 01:11:03.660]   So I'm gonna, okay, stare at this picture,
[01:11:03.660 --> 01:11:04.980]   stare at this timeline a little bit.
[01:11:04.980 --> 01:11:08.460]   You guys know what all this is about, okay?
[01:11:08.460 --> 01:11:10.820]   I'm gonna add one more, what do you see there?
[01:11:10.820 --> 01:11:13.620]   We're jamming, right?
[01:11:14.740 --> 01:11:18.100]   We are jamming, what's a W?
[01:11:18.100 --> 01:11:22.140]   War, split and war are the same thing, okay?
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:25.660]   Elijah, Elisha, Assyria.
[01:11:25.660 --> 01:11:31.620]   So Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, and Numbers,
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.060]   Deuteronomy are all going there.
[01:11:35.060 --> 01:11:40.940]   I would just maybe like, don't write out the whole thing,
[01:11:40.940 --> 01:11:43.660]   just kinda go like G-E-E-X, okay?
[01:11:44.660 --> 01:11:45.780]   And then you see,
[01:11:45.780 --> 01:11:50.940]   Genesis, Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, Deuteronomy,
[01:11:50.940 --> 01:11:55.860]   Joshua, Judges, Ruth, right there.
[01:11:55.860 --> 01:12:00.660]   Got that?
[01:12:00.660 --> 01:12:06.420]   Joshua, Judges, Ruth, first and second,
[01:12:06.420 --> 01:12:09.060]   Samuel, first Kings.
[01:12:09.060 --> 01:12:09.900]   First Kings.
[01:12:09.900 --> 01:12:16.900]   Second Kings.
[01:12:16.900 --> 01:12:20.100]   Okay, why did I emphasize that?
[01:12:20.100 --> 01:12:25.100]   'Cause that's a long old timeline, okay?
[01:12:25.100 --> 01:12:31.380]   First and second Chronicles, first Chronicles.
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.460]   And if you look at first Chronicles,
[01:12:34.460 --> 01:12:35.540]   I put a little dash there.
[01:12:35.540 --> 01:12:37.260]   Why did I put a little dash there?
[01:12:38.260 --> 01:12:42.260]   'Cause it traces it from the time before David.
[01:12:42.260 --> 01:12:45.220]   'Cause it's talking about David's ancestry as well, right?
[01:12:45.220 --> 01:12:49.500]   First and second Chronicles, okay?
[01:12:49.500 --> 01:12:59.980]   And what's next?
[01:12:59.980 --> 01:13:06.220]   Ezra, Nehemiah, and between second Chronicles and Ezra,
[01:13:06.220 --> 01:13:08.540]   is there a small period of time or a big gap?
[01:13:08.540 --> 01:13:11.300]   Big gap, because what happened,
[01:13:11.300 --> 01:13:16.180]   for how many years were the people of Judah in captivity?
[01:13:16.180 --> 01:13:17.020]   70.
[01:13:17.020 --> 01:13:20.100]   Goes over there.
[01:13:20.100 --> 01:13:23.940]   Ezra, Nehemiah, and then Esther is later.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:25.220]   And all of the stuff that happens
[01:13:25.220 --> 01:13:26.580]   is all squished at the end, okay?
[01:13:26.580 --> 01:13:28.220]   So this is not to scale.
[01:13:28.220 --> 01:13:32.420]   I'm just giving you a biblical eye view, okay?
[01:13:32.420 --> 01:13:33.580]   But this is not to scale,
[01:13:33.580 --> 01:13:35.260]   'cause I couldn't fit that all in one slide
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:37.500]   without you guys having to strain your eyes, okay?
[01:13:37.500 --> 01:13:39.660]   Ezra, Nehemiah, Esther,
[01:13:39.660 --> 01:13:44.660]   Job, Psalms, Proverbs.
[01:13:44.660 --> 01:13:45.740]   Job is there.
[01:13:45.740 --> 01:13:47.500]   Where did we go?
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:48.340]   Where did Job go?
[01:13:48.340 --> 01:13:55.420]   So, if you introduce a new believer to Jesus Christ,
[01:13:55.420 --> 01:13:56.660]   a new person to Jesus Christ,
[01:13:56.660 --> 01:13:57.900]   so he becomes a believer,
[01:13:57.900 --> 01:13:59.020]   and you say, "Read the Bible,"
[01:13:59.020 --> 01:14:01.780]   and they say, "Okay, I'll start in Genesis."
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:02.900]   And then they get old.
[01:14:02.900 --> 01:14:07.540]   They somehow manage to get through Esther,
[01:14:07.540 --> 01:14:10.140]   and then Job is back where, oh my goodness,
[01:14:10.140 --> 01:14:12.460]   what is going on here?
[01:14:12.460 --> 01:14:14.980]   This is why it's hard, 'cause remember,
[01:14:14.980 --> 01:14:16.500]   the Bible is not, Old Testament is not
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:19.180]   chronologically written, it's what?
[01:14:19.180 --> 01:14:20.980]   Genre, okay?
[01:14:20.980 --> 01:14:24.100]   Job, Psalms.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:31.700]   'Cause Moses has something there, okay?
[01:14:32.700 --> 01:14:34.780]   And what was Psalms about?
[01:14:34.780 --> 01:14:39.860]   Prayers and praises, and what's Proverbs about?
[01:14:39.860 --> 01:14:46.500]   Life skills, wisdom, Ecclesiastes, vanity,
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:50.540]   Song of Solomon, about the beauty of love
[01:14:50.540 --> 01:14:51.820]   in a covenant marriage.
[01:14:51.820 --> 01:14:56.180]   Song of Solomon, Job, Psalms, Proverbs, Ecclesiastes,
[01:14:56.180 --> 01:14:57.860]   okay, that's all five of the poetry, okay?
[01:14:57.860 --> 01:14:58.700]   Here you go.
[01:14:58.700 --> 01:15:01.260]   (clears throat)
[01:15:01.260 --> 01:15:03.660]   Proverbs, Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon goes there.
[01:15:03.660 --> 01:15:09.380]   Ecclesiastes, Song of Solomon,
[01:15:09.380 --> 01:15:11.380]   and then we get the prophets.
[01:15:11.380 --> 01:15:12.220]   Isaiah.
[01:15:12.220 --> 01:15:18.060]   Jeremiah.
[01:15:18.060 --> 01:15:20.300]   Lamentations.
[01:15:20.300 --> 01:15:21.140]   Ezekiel.
[01:15:21.140 --> 01:15:22.860]   Daniel.
[01:15:22.860 --> 01:15:28.220]   Do you know Daniel was born in the year of the lamb?
[01:15:28.220 --> 01:15:30.500]   He was born when Assyria was in power,
[01:15:30.500 --> 01:15:32.620]   he's a youth when Babylon takes over,
[01:15:32.620 --> 01:15:35.500]   and then when the Medo-Persian kings come,
[01:15:35.500 --> 01:15:37.540]   they're the ones who throw him into the lion's den.
[01:15:37.540 --> 01:15:42.220]   70 years later, 60 years later.
[01:15:42.220 --> 01:15:45.580]   So if you look at Daniel, in just a couple chapters,
[01:15:45.580 --> 01:15:49.180]   he goes from a little teenage kid to an old man.
[01:15:49.180 --> 01:15:53.580]   Daniel sees all of it, and he also actually sees
[01:15:53.580 --> 01:15:56.180]   a vision of the Roman Empire,
[01:15:56.180 --> 01:15:57.660]   he sees the vision of the Greeks,
[01:15:57.660 --> 01:15:59.820]   he sees a vision of Jesus who's gonna come
[01:15:59.820 --> 01:16:03.780]   as a little rock, boom, knock this whole thing down.
[01:16:03.780 --> 01:16:06.820]   Okay, so Daniel is a very interesting book,
[01:16:06.820 --> 01:16:08.700]   and in seminaries, Daniel and Revelation
[01:16:08.700 --> 01:16:10.940]   are usually studied together.
[01:16:10.940 --> 01:16:12.060]   Okay, Daniel.
[01:16:12.060 --> 01:16:15.380]   Isaiah, Jeremiah, Lamentations, Ezekiel,
[01:16:15.380 --> 01:16:17.980]   Daniel, Hosea, Joel, (speaking in foreign language)
[01:16:17.980 --> 01:16:19.980]   Okay, so now all the minor prophets are,
[01:16:19.980 --> 01:16:23.060]   Daniel, Hosea, okay, all the minor prophets are coming,
[01:16:23.060 --> 01:16:25.340]   boom, you're going backward.
[01:16:26.340 --> 01:16:29.620]   Hosea, Amos, Micah, Nahum, remember,
[01:16:29.620 --> 01:16:30.620]   (speaking in foreign language)
[01:16:30.620 --> 01:16:31.460]   Right?
[01:16:31.460 --> 01:16:35.940]   Now, Obadiah and Joel are in italics,
[01:16:35.940 --> 01:16:38.020]   and they have a question mark there.
[01:16:38.020 --> 01:16:39.220]   Do you know why that is?
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.340]   There is debate as to when they were written.
[01:16:43.340 --> 01:16:48.260]   For example, Jeremiah 49 and Obadiah
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.700]   have a lot of similarity, but Jeremiah is much later.
[01:16:51.700 --> 01:16:55.660]   And remember, there are like 14 Obadiahs,
[01:16:55.660 --> 01:16:58.260]   so we don't know which of them wrote this one.
[01:16:58.260 --> 01:17:00.380]   Okay, and Joel, there's nothing inside of it
[01:17:00.380 --> 01:17:03.420]   that'll tell us where to date it.
[01:17:03.420 --> 01:17:05.340]   So Obadiah and Joel, you don't really know
[01:17:05.340 --> 01:17:06.820]   what time to put them in,
[01:17:06.820 --> 01:17:09.380]   so we're just putting them in there, okay,
[01:17:09.380 --> 01:17:10.380]   with question marks.
[01:17:10.380 --> 01:17:14.060]   We jammin', what was the jammin'?
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:20.260]   Jonah, Amos, Hezekiah, Hosea, Micah, Isaiah,
[01:17:21.100 --> 01:17:26.100]   Nahum, Jonah and Nahum are about A, okay?
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:30.420]   And then Habakkuk, Zephaniah,
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:35.500]   they're a transitionary, okay?
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:38.700]   Remember, Habakkuk is watching God show him
[01:17:38.700 --> 01:17:40.660]   what's gonna happen, he doesn't like it.
[01:17:40.660 --> 01:17:46.740]   And then, woo, fast forward a lot.
[01:17:46.740 --> 01:17:48.300]   Haggai, Zechariah are over there.
[01:17:48.300 --> 01:17:57.380]   And the last book, Malachi.
[01:17:57.380 --> 01:18:06.420]   So, when you introduce someone to faith
[01:18:06.420 --> 01:18:09.580]   and you're having them read through the Old Testament,
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:13.300]   walk them through it, but maybe you couldn't walk them
[01:18:13.300 --> 01:18:14.500]   through the Old Testament,
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:17.100]   walk them through it, but maybe you couldn't walk them
[01:18:17.100 --> 01:18:18.660]   through it because you couldn't walk through it
[01:18:18.660 --> 01:18:21.660]   without tripping all over yourselves, right?
[01:18:21.660 --> 01:18:25.020]   Now you can, and we still have two more sessions
[01:18:25.020 --> 01:18:27.660]   to go over all this stuff, okay?
[01:18:27.660 --> 01:18:28.500]   We're running out of time,
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:30.300]   so I'm gonna fast forward a little bit.
[01:18:30.300 --> 01:18:34.900]   Oopsie, did I do everything?
[01:18:34.900 --> 01:18:41.260]   What happened?
[01:18:43.540 --> 01:18:44.380]   Ah, ah.
[01:18:44.380 --> 01:18:55.420]   Oh, we did go over everything, right?
[01:18:55.420 --> 01:19:00.420]   Okay, so for three minutes,
[01:19:00.420 --> 01:19:02.940]   I want you guys to review what we looked at today.
[01:19:02.940 --> 01:19:12.100]   There's a lot that we covered.
[01:19:12.100 --> 01:19:15.100]   (audience laughing)
[01:19:15.100 --> 01:19:18.140]   Go over this with your partner,
[01:19:18.140 --> 01:19:21.900]   and then we're gonna do our traditional Bible song,
[01:19:21.900 --> 01:19:23.140]   and then we'll end, okay?
[01:19:23.140 --> 01:19:26.180]   So two, three minutes, find a partner,
[01:19:26.180 --> 01:19:27.300]   or go over this with your partner.
[01:19:27.300 --> 01:19:29.860]   If you wanna find somebody new, you could do that.
[01:19:29.860 --> 01:19:32.700]   And then go over the, especially the red part,
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:34.300]   and I'll give you three minutes.
[01:19:34.300 --> 01:19:41.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:19:41.300 --> 01:19:44.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:19:44.300 --> 01:19:47.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:19:47.300 --> 01:19:50.300]   (audience laughing)

[01:19:59.300 --> 01:20:07.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:20:07.300 --> 01:20:14.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:20:14.300 --> 01:20:17.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:20:17.300 --> 01:20:28.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:20:42.300 --> 01:20:45.300]   (audience laughing)
[01:20:45.300 --> 01:20:58.540]   One more minute.
[01:20:58.540 --> 01:21:02.820]   Okay, fine, one minute, 34 seconds.
[01:21:02.820 --> 01:21:07.300]   Are you your own partner?
[01:21:07.300 --> 01:21:09.300]   - I am my own partner.
[01:21:09.300 --> 01:21:11.940]   (audience laughing)
[01:21:11.940 --> 01:21:13.100]   - Are you in?

[01:21:51.260 --> 01:21:54.460]   who are the noteworthy bad kings of Israel?
[01:21:54.460 --> 01:21:57.060]   No?
[01:21:57.060 --> 01:21:59.060]   Jeroboajib.
[01:21:59.060 --> 01:22:02.060]   (audience laughing)

[01:25:01.860 --> 01:25:10.860]   Father, thank you for helping us walk through your scriptures.
[01:25:10.860 --> 01:25:13.060]   I pray that you would give us a deeper hunger
[01:25:13.060 --> 01:25:16.460]   to know you, to know your word, to know your heart,
[01:25:16.460 --> 01:25:19.260]   and to live according to all the precepts
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:21.060]   and the statutes and the ordinances
[01:25:21.060 --> 01:25:24.060]   that you've set out for us,
[01:25:24.060 --> 01:25:26.460]   as you've done so with a heart of great love for us.
[01:25:26.460 --> 01:25:28.460]   I pray that you would help us to be effective
[01:25:28.460 --> 01:25:31.460]   when we defend our faith
[01:25:31.460 --> 01:25:34.260]   and when we defend your scriptures.
[01:25:34.260 --> 01:25:37.260]   More and more, we are living in a biblically illiterate time
[01:25:37.260 --> 01:25:40.260]   in the church, and Lord, we need your help
[01:25:40.260 --> 01:25:42.860]   to be salt and light now,
[01:25:42.860 --> 01:25:47.060]   even in just the universal church.
[01:25:47.060 --> 01:25:50.260]   Help us, Lord, just to be faithful to your text,
[01:25:50.260 --> 01:25:52.860]   not to deviate or stray from it,
[01:25:52.860 --> 01:25:56.460]   but to keep it, to observe it, to teach it, to practice it,
[01:25:56.460 --> 01:26:00.260]   so that all of us could be little Ezras, Lord,
[01:26:00.260 --> 01:26:01.860]   in service of your kingdom.
[01:26:01.860 --> 01:26:04.460]   We thank you, and we pray these things in Jesus' name.
[01:26:04.460 --> 01:26:05.460]   Amen. All right.
