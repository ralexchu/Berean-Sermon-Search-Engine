[00:08:41.140 --> 00:08:43.480]   Welcome to our sixth online service
[00:08:43.480 --> 00:08:45.020]   at Breen Community Church.
[00:08:45.020 --> 00:08:46.480]   Hope all you guys doing well.
[00:08:46.480 --> 00:08:49.680]   We just have a few quick announcements
[00:08:49.680 --> 00:08:50.740]   before we get started.
[00:08:50.740 --> 00:08:54.100]   And again, we're watching the situation going on
[00:08:54.100 --> 00:08:55.640]   in the federal government and the state government.
[00:08:55.640 --> 00:08:58.960]   And we have just a few updates
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:01.580]   that we're gonna be giving at 3 p.m.
[00:09:01.580 --> 00:09:03.620]   So if you're a member of the church,
[00:09:03.620 --> 00:09:06.860]   we'll be giving you some updates at 3 p.m. in Zoom.
[00:09:06.860 --> 00:09:09.020]   So again, it's not a mandatory meeting,
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:10.940]   but if you want to come,
[00:09:10.940 --> 00:09:13.260]   it won't be too long of a meeting,
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:15.460]   but it'll be taking place at 3 p.m. today
[00:09:15.460 --> 00:09:18.300]   after all your lunch and discussion time.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.420]   And if you are not a member of the church,
[00:09:20.420 --> 00:09:22.780]   we'll give you the update and information on the Facebook
[00:09:22.780 --> 00:09:24.440]   and different apps that you have.
[00:09:24.440 --> 00:09:27.180]   So whatever information that you need to know
[00:09:27.180 --> 00:09:28.600]   will be on there, okay?
[00:09:28.600 --> 00:09:30.440]   Another announcement,
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:32.140]   we have a Sisters Praise and Prayer Night
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:34.660]   that is taking place on May 9th.
[00:09:34.660 --> 00:09:36.780]   Not this coming Saturday, but the Saturday,
[00:09:36.780 --> 00:09:37.620]   is that Saturday?
[00:09:37.620 --> 00:09:39.860]   Yeah, Saturday after that at 8.30 p.m.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:42.820]   And so the link will be on the church website
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:43.940]   and the Facebook.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:46.060]   So if you can look for that, again, May 9th,
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.220]   which is Saturday at 8.30 p.m.
[00:09:48.220 --> 00:09:53.860]   On May 4th, which would be next Monday,
[00:09:53.860 --> 00:09:55.400]   on May, is that Monday, right?
[00:09:55.400 --> 00:09:56.280]   Yeah.
[00:09:56.280 --> 00:10:00.300]   We will be having a baptism information session and Q&A.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.660]   So there's gonna be a link that you'll be able to see
[00:10:02.660 --> 00:10:04.920]   on Facebook and on the church website.
[00:10:04.920 --> 00:10:07.780]   And so this is to kind of give you explanation
[00:10:07.780 --> 00:10:10.460]   of what's going on, the position of the church.
[00:10:10.460 --> 00:10:12.320]   And I know a lot of you guys had questions
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:15.660]   because of recent clarification
[00:10:15.660 --> 00:10:17.700]   of what we are asking for the members.
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.280]   And so if you have questions,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.860]   we're gonna be giving you update,
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.260]   and then we'll try to answer some of the questions.
[00:10:23.260 --> 00:10:25.900]   We wanted to hold off on this until we came live,
[00:10:25.900 --> 00:10:27.300]   but we're not exactly sure
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.640]   when we're gonna be able to do that physically.
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:31.920]   So we're gonna, it may not be as thorough
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.700]   as what we intended initially,
[00:10:33.700 --> 00:10:35.740]   but we wanna at least give you a heads up
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:38.380]   and it'd be a good opportunity for you to understand
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:41.160]   what's going on as far as that's concerned, okay?
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.180]   And we have a few shout outs this morning before we start.
[00:10:45.180 --> 00:10:48.340]   Okay, we have, let me start with the birthdays.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.300]   This week, Brooklyn Wong.

[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:07.900]   We have some shout outs for the good list.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:11.020]   Brandon Tang, good job, buddy.
[00:11:11.020 --> 00:11:13.260]   Hayden Iglesia.
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:19.220]   Okay, and then Jayden Kim and Danielle Irving.
[00:11:19.580 --> 00:11:21.460]   Okay, good job, keep up the good work.
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:24.700]   All right, let me pray for us
[00:11:24.700 --> 00:11:26.260]   and then we'll prepare for offering
[00:11:26.260 --> 00:11:28.700]   before we get into the worship set.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:29.520]   Let's pray.
[00:11:29.520 --> 00:11:35.040]   Gracious and sovereign God,
[00:11:35.040 --> 00:11:38.780]   we come before you this morning
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.140]   desiring to give you a worship
[00:11:40.140 --> 00:11:41.680]   that is in spirit and in truth.
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:46.320]   Wherever our mind may have been,
[00:11:46.320 --> 00:11:48.460]   I pray, Lord, this morning will be an opportunity
[00:11:48.460 --> 00:11:51.260]   to give all our attention to Christ,
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:54.880]   that we may hear his voice and that we may follow him.
[00:11:54.880 --> 00:11:57.780]   I pray that the offering that we give,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:11:59.940]   that we would give intentionally,
[00:11:59.940 --> 00:12:01.620]   that we would give it in a manner, Lord God,
[00:12:01.620 --> 00:12:03.460]   that is pleasing to you,
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:08.020]   may it be multiplied, especially now for the kingdom work.
[00:12:08.020 --> 00:12:09.780]   And we ask, Lord God, that, again,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:13.660]   whether we are at home or whether we are by ourselves
[00:12:13.660 --> 00:12:16.700]   or with our families, Lord, that the spirit of God
[00:12:16.700 --> 00:12:20.260]   and the word of God would unite us in one spirit,
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:22.860]   that we may worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:12:22.860 --> 00:12:24.580]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:22:19.460 --> 00:22:28.540]   - All right, good morning.
[00:22:28.540 --> 00:22:32.860]   If you've been following us in our worship,
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:35.740]   we've been in the series of the I Am Statements of Christ.
[00:22:35.740 --> 00:22:37.180]   There are seven specific ones.
[00:22:37.180 --> 00:22:40.780]   And we talked about Jesus as the bread of life.
[00:22:40.780 --> 00:22:43.180]   We talked about Jesus as the light of the world.
[00:22:43.180 --> 00:22:45.340]   And then during Easter, we talked about Jesus
[00:22:45.340 --> 00:22:47.180]   as the resurrection and the life.
[00:22:47.180 --> 00:22:49.340]   So we're gonna be covering chapter 10,
[00:22:49.340 --> 00:22:51.460]   but it's really connected to chapter nine.
[00:22:51.460 --> 00:22:54.620]   And it has to be understood together
[00:22:54.620 --> 00:22:57.500]   because chapter 10 is spoken of
[00:22:57.500 --> 00:23:00.020]   in the context of what happens in chapter nine.
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.860]   And so we have the two statements of Jesus
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.780]   where he says, "I am the door and I am the good shepherd."
[00:23:05.780 --> 00:23:08.620]   And so let me read the passage where he states that
[00:23:08.620 --> 00:23:10.260]   in John chapter 10, verse seven,
[00:23:10.260 --> 00:23:11.900]   in John chapter 10, verse 11,
[00:23:11.900 --> 00:23:14.260]   and then we'll jump into the text this morning.
[00:23:15.260 --> 00:23:17.740]   John chapter 10, verse seven,
[00:23:17.740 --> 00:23:20.260]   Jesus said to them, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.100]   "I am the door of the sheep."
[00:23:23.100 --> 00:23:26.260]   And then John chapter 10, 11, "I am the good shepherd.
[00:23:26.260 --> 00:23:29.020]   "The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep."
[00:23:29.020 --> 00:23:29.860]   Let's pray.
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:36.940]   Father, we pray that your word would speak to us,
[00:23:36.940 --> 00:23:39.460]   help us have a deepening understanding of Christ,
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:42.260]   and that in light of the surpassing knowledge
[00:23:42.260 --> 00:23:46.180]   of knowing him better, that all these other things,
[00:23:46.180 --> 00:23:48.980]   Lord God, that easily entangles us and tempts us
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.660]   would truly become rubbish.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:53.360]   Help us, Lord, to see a greater vision
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:56.980]   of the glory of Christ, that our eyes may be opened,
[00:23:56.980 --> 00:23:59.060]   that we may see the light,
[00:23:59.060 --> 00:24:00.700]   and that Christ and Christ alone
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:02.960]   would be our treasure and our goal.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.300]   So we ask for your anointing this time, this morning,
[00:24:05.300 --> 00:24:07.580]   that our worship may be given to you
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:09.340]   in a way that honors and glorifies you.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:11.060]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:24:11.220 --> 00:24:12.060]   - Amen.
[00:24:12.060 --> 00:24:15.940]   - So again, as I said, chapter 10, these two statements,
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:20.340]   the I am statements, really ought to be understood together.
[00:24:20.340 --> 00:24:22.660]   So if you've read chapter 10 before this morning,
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.700]   or you've studied it before, you may have noticed
[00:24:25.700 --> 00:24:27.580]   that in chapter 10, the I am the door
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:30.860]   and I am the good shepherd is really used interchangeably.
[00:24:30.860 --> 00:24:33.940]   So it's hard to dissect, is he talking about the door,
[00:24:33.940 --> 00:24:35.060]   is he talking about the shepherd?
[00:24:35.060 --> 00:24:39.100]   Because again, you'll see better what he means by that
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:41.220]   by really looking at chapter nine.
[00:24:41.220 --> 00:24:43.940]   In fact, if you don't look at chapter nine,
[00:24:43.940 --> 00:24:45.420]   what Jesus says about the door
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.980]   is really not gonna make a lot of sense.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:50.700]   We can understand Jesus as a good shepherd,
[00:24:50.700 --> 00:24:52.100]   that he's a shepherd, we are the sheep,
[00:24:52.100 --> 00:24:53.500]   he guides us, he leads us, feeds us,
[00:24:53.500 --> 00:24:55.340]   we understand that aspect of it,
[00:24:55.340 --> 00:24:56.820]   or it's easier to understand.
[00:24:56.820 --> 00:24:59.900]   But what is the statement of I am the door?
[00:24:59.900 --> 00:25:01.660]   So again, if you don't understand the context
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.780]   in which he says that, the I am the door statement,
[00:25:03.780 --> 00:25:05.740]   it really is just gonna go over your head.
[00:25:05.740 --> 00:25:08.260]   And so while Jesus says he's the door, so we trust him,
[00:25:08.260 --> 00:25:09.740]   but what does he mean by that?
[00:25:09.740 --> 00:25:14.740]   How did the first recipients understood this statement?
[00:25:14.740 --> 00:25:17.260]   In order to do that, we have to look at the event
[00:25:17.260 --> 00:25:21.140]   in chapter nine, because that statement is said
[00:25:21.140 --> 00:25:22.340]   right after this event.
[00:25:22.340 --> 00:25:24.340]   And so what happens in chapter nine?
[00:25:24.340 --> 00:25:28.580]   So what I ask you to do, because there's too many verses,
[00:25:28.580 --> 00:25:31.880]   I don't have the text that's gonna be written on the screen,
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:32.980]   so if you have your Bibles,
[00:25:32.980 --> 00:25:36.260]   I ask that you would open up to John chapter nine
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:37.140]   and just keep it there,
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:39.540]   because I'm gonna be reading the narrative,
[00:25:39.540 --> 00:25:41.260]   parts of it together with you,
[00:25:41.260 --> 00:25:44.620]   and then when we get to the three-point meaning
[00:25:44.620 --> 00:25:47.460]   of I am the door and I am the good shepherd,
[00:25:47.460 --> 00:25:48.460]   it'll be easier to follow
[00:25:48.460 --> 00:25:49.740]   and then text will be coming up for you.
[00:25:49.740 --> 00:25:51.640]   Okay, so let's look at John chapter nine.
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:52.780]   What happens here?
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:55.080]   That sets up for his statement, I am the door.
[00:25:55.080 --> 00:25:57.260]   John chapter nine, verse one, it says,
[00:25:57.260 --> 00:26:01.140]   "As he passed by, he saw a man blind from birth,
[00:26:01.140 --> 00:26:02.360]   "and his disciples asked him,
[00:26:02.360 --> 00:26:05.020]   "Rabbi, who sinned, this man or his parents,
[00:26:05.020 --> 00:26:06.500]   "that he would be born blind?"
[00:26:06.500 --> 00:26:08.660]   So let me stop right there, okay?
[00:26:08.660 --> 00:26:10.700]   So the setup of the story is
[00:26:10.700 --> 00:26:12.240]   that they run into this blind man,
[00:26:12.240 --> 00:26:14.860]   and you can see by the attitude of the disciples,
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:17.300]   the very first question that they ask,
[00:26:17.300 --> 00:26:19.260]   which was not unique to the disciples,
[00:26:19.260 --> 00:26:21.680]   the whole Jewish community believed
[00:26:21.680 --> 00:26:23.220]   that if you had any kind of defect
[00:26:23.220 --> 00:26:24.860]   or if you were struggling,
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:27.780]   that it must have been because you're being punished by God
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:28.940]   for some kind of sin,
[00:26:28.940 --> 00:26:32.020]   and that was their initial first response,
[00:26:32.020 --> 00:26:33.340]   and you can understand,
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.100]   if that was their attitude toward the blind,
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:40.860]   there was no benevolence program for them,
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:43.420]   'cause they believed you deserved it.
[00:26:43.420 --> 00:26:46.820]   In fact, in many cultures around the world,
[00:26:46.820 --> 00:26:49.180]   unlike the Judeo-Christian culture,
[00:26:49.180 --> 00:26:50.620]   they believe that if you're suffering,
[00:26:50.620 --> 00:26:53.900]   if you're poor, if some affliction happened to you,
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:56.500]   you must have done something maybe in your previous life,
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:26:57.860]   and you need to pay off your sins
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.620]   in order for you to progress into the next life.
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:04.780]   Many cultures, they actually speak against helping the poor
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.500]   because they must be poor for a reason.
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:11.420]   Well, the Jewish culture was very similar to that.
[00:27:11.420 --> 00:27:13.780]   Not only did they have the physical hardship,
[00:27:13.780 --> 00:27:15.980]   they believed that if something bad happened to you,
[00:27:15.980 --> 00:27:17.160]   you must have done something,
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.580]   and that's why they were asking a question,
[00:27:19.580 --> 00:27:22.340]   not unique to the disciples, but the Jewish culture itself.
[00:27:22.340 --> 00:27:24.440]   So you can imagine as a blind person,
[00:27:24.440 --> 00:27:28.280]   hard enough, your life is hard enough as it is,
[00:27:28.280 --> 00:27:30.760]   but that the people around you in society,
[00:27:30.760 --> 00:27:32.720]   every time you came around, it's like, look at that guy.
[00:27:32.720 --> 00:27:34.480]   He must have done something.
[00:27:34.480 --> 00:27:36.000]   And that's the question that is asked,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:37.920]   and Jesus answers in verse three.
[00:27:37.920 --> 00:27:41.960]   It was neither that this man has sinned nor his parents,
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.140]   but it was so that the works of God
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.100]   might be displayed in him.
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.600]   Remember, Jesus says the same thing in John 11
[00:27:48.600 --> 00:27:50.540]   about Lazarus's death.
[00:27:50.540 --> 00:27:53.020]   He said, God allowed to happen
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.400]   because God has a specific plan.
[00:27:56.260 --> 00:27:58.680]   So Jesus, obviously, you know the story
[00:27:58.680 --> 00:28:01.940]   about how he spits on the ground and takes mud
[00:28:01.940 --> 00:28:04.260]   and puts it on his eyes and tells him to go
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.780]   and wash at the pool of Siloam.
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:08.480]   Then he comes back and he sees.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:14.900]   And then when people see it, they're obviously surprised.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:18.900]   Wasn't this man the same guy who used to beg at the temple
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:20.680]   day in and day out?
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.600]   How was he able to see?
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:23.720]   So some people didn't believe him.
[00:28:23.720 --> 00:28:25.220]   Some people said that maybe it was somebody
[00:28:25.220 --> 00:28:27.920]   that looked like him, and then he begins to speak up.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:32.980]   And he says, I am the one, in verse nine, to confirm.
[00:28:32.980 --> 00:28:35.060]   So you can imagine he opens his eyes
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.340]   and he's excited to go see people,
[00:28:37.340 --> 00:28:38.820]   and then people are like, no, that can't be you.
[00:28:38.820 --> 00:28:41.040]   How can that have possibly happened?
[00:28:41.040 --> 00:28:43.380]   So again, all of this is a setup
[00:28:43.380 --> 00:28:45.220]   of what's gonna happen in chapter 10.
[00:28:45.220 --> 00:28:48.340]   We get to verse 13.
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:50.760]   And so some people are shocked.
[00:28:50.760 --> 00:28:51.820]   Some people are praising God.
[00:28:51.820 --> 00:28:53.500]   Some people don't believe.
[00:28:53.500 --> 00:28:55.260]   But look at the response of the Pharisees,
[00:28:55.260 --> 00:28:56.700]   the leaders, in verse 13.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.080]   They brought to the Pharisees the man
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.580]   who was formerly blind.
[00:29:00.580 --> 00:29:03.500]   Now it was a Sabbath on the day when Jesus made this clay
[00:29:03.500 --> 00:29:04.760]   and opened his eyes.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.860]   Then the Pharisees also were asking him again
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:08.020]   how he received the sight.
[00:29:08.020 --> 00:29:10.700]   And he said to them, he applied clay to my eyes
[00:29:10.700 --> 00:29:12.180]   and I washed it and I see.
[00:29:12.180 --> 00:29:14.060]   And look at verse 16, what they say.
[00:29:14.060 --> 00:29:15.440]   Therefore some of the Pharisees were saying,
[00:29:15.440 --> 00:29:16.840]   this man is not from God
[00:29:16.840 --> 00:29:18.980]   because he does not keep the Sabbath.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:23.480]   A miracle takes place.
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:25.300]   A man who was blind all his life,
[00:29:25.300 --> 00:29:29.820]   that was a common figure at the temple gate.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:32.100]   And there's clear evidence that his eyes are open.
[00:29:32.100 --> 00:29:34.340]   But their first response is,
[00:29:34.340 --> 00:29:36.680]   because Jesus doesn't jump through the hoops
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:38.760]   the way we ask our people to.
[00:29:38.760 --> 00:29:39.740]   He didn't keep the Sabbath.
[00:29:39.740 --> 00:29:44.020]   And again, Jesus never broke the Sabbath command of God.
[00:29:44.020 --> 00:29:47.440]   He broke the Sabbath that they created.
[00:29:47.440 --> 00:29:49.500]   All the extra laws that they created.
[00:29:49.500 --> 00:29:53.400]   So if he doesn't abide by us,
[00:29:53.400 --> 00:29:55.220]   he can't possibly be from God.
[00:29:55.220 --> 00:29:57.300]   That's basically what they're saying.
[00:29:57.300 --> 00:29:59.300]   If he doesn't submit to us,
[00:29:59.300 --> 00:30:03.820]   even if he performs a miracle, he's not from God.
[00:30:03.820 --> 00:30:06.260]   'Cause clearly I'm the one anointed by God,
[00:30:06.260 --> 00:30:07.780]   so therefore if you don't submit to me,
[00:30:07.780 --> 00:30:09.260]   you must not be from God.
[00:30:09.260 --> 00:30:11.440]   That's basically what they're saying.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:14.260]   How can a man who is a sinner perform such signs?
[00:30:14.260 --> 00:30:16.900]   And there was a division among them.
[00:30:16.900 --> 00:30:18.420]   So they said to the blind man again,
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:21.020]   what do you say about him since he opened your eyes?
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:24.900]   And he said, he is a prophet, verse 18.
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.680]   The Jews then did not believe it of him,
[00:30:27.680 --> 00:30:29.640]   that he had been blind and had received sight
[00:30:29.640 --> 00:30:31.240]   until they called the parents
[00:30:31.240 --> 00:30:35.000]   the very one who had received his sight.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:36.800]   So okay, so obviously you're a sinner.
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:38.160]   We can't trust what you say.
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:39.360]   Jesus doesn't submit to us,
[00:30:39.360 --> 00:30:41.280]   so therefore he must not be from God.
[00:30:41.280 --> 00:30:42.840]   So we're gonna investigate a little further.
[00:30:42.840 --> 00:30:45.120]   We're gonna call his parents.
[00:30:45.120 --> 00:30:48.960]   Now, understand the blind man's relationship
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:49.940]   with the parents.
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:53.900]   Typically at that time, if you were blind,
[00:30:53.900 --> 00:30:56.820]   there was no social program to take care of you.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.580]   And other people would look at the blind man
[00:30:59.580 --> 00:31:01.060]   and say, remember the question that they asked?
[00:31:01.060 --> 00:31:02.060]   Was it his sin?
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:04.780]   And what was the other question?
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:06.820]   Or was it his parents?
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:09.580]   So to have a blind son in the house
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:11.860]   would invite ridicule from the society
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:12.700]   that they belonged to.
[00:31:12.700 --> 00:31:15.540]   So the typical practice was to release them
[00:31:15.540 --> 00:31:18.180]   to live with other blind people.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:21.040]   And that's probably why he was begging at the temple gate,
[00:31:21.040 --> 00:31:23.680]   because his parents weren't taking care of him.
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:25.820]   And his parents show up because they,
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:27.480]   for the purpose of indicting Jesus,
[00:31:27.480 --> 00:31:31.140]   they call them in and they ask them,
[00:31:31.140 --> 00:31:35.000]   your son clearly wasn't blind
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:36.920]   because this sinner, Jesus,
[00:31:36.920 --> 00:31:38.480]   could not have performed this miracle.
[00:31:38.480 --> 00:31:41.160]   In verse 20, his parents answered them and said,
[00:31:41.160 --> 00:31:44.320]   we know that this is our son and that he was born blind.
[00:31:44.320 --> 00:31:47.560]   In other words, I can't lie to you, right?
[00:31:47.560 --> 00:31:48.380]   That's what he was.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:51.200]   And then verse 20, but how he now sees,
[00:31:51.200 --> 00:31:52.420]   we do not know.
[00:31:52.420 --> 00:31:54.980]   Or who opened his eyes, we do not know.
[00:31:54.980 --> 00:31:57.840]   Ask him, he is of age, he will speak for himself.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:31:59.500]   Now, let me stop right there, okay?
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:02.080]   Because what they say in the next text
[00:32:02.080 --> 00:32:06.160]   is really the setup of what Jesus says in verse 10.
[00:32:06.160 --> 00:32:07.660]   Verse 22.
[00:32:07.660 --> 00:32:11.700]   His parents said this because they were afraid of the Jews.
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:14.060]   For the Jews had already agreed
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.660]   that if anyone confessed him to be Christ,
[00:32:16.660 --> 00:32:19.960]   he was to be put out of the synagogue.
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:21.220]   Okay, stop right there.
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:25.500]   The Pharisees were the leaders of the synagogue.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.720]   Now, understand what the synagogue was.
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:30.180]   The temple was God-ordained
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:32.700]   where people were to come give sacrifices.
[00:32:32.700 --> 00:32:35.300]   But because of the diaspora of the Jews,
[00:32:35.300 --> 00:32:39.760]   they were spread all over the known world at that time,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:42.500]   they had to find a way to worship God.
[00:32:42.500 --> 00:32:45.580]   So what they did was, their law was,
[00:32:45.580 --> 00:32:48.820]   wherever there was 10 men, Jewish men,
[00:32:48.820 --> 00:32:51.420]   they were given permission to set up a synagogue,
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:53.420]   sort of a mini-temple.
[00:32:53.420 --> 00:32:54.740]   And so through that synagogue,
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:57.460]   they would perform the worships
[00:32:57.460 --> 00:32:59.340]   and various things that they needed to do,
[00:32:59.340 --> 00:33:00.420]   but the major sacrifice,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.300]   they still needed to come to the temple.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:05.780]   So the temple was ruled by the Sanhedrin
[00:33:05.780 --> 00:33:08.480]   and the high priest.
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:11.500]   But the synagogues were ruled by the Pharisees.
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:14.740]   And that's where majority of the Jews practiced their faith.
[00:33:15.580 --> 00:33:18.980]   So for the leaders of Israel to say,
[00:33:18.980 --> 00:33:20.860]   if you don't agree with us,
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.860]   if you don't submit to us,
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.260]   if you don't agree that this man clearly is a sinner
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:27.340]   because he's calling us out, so we're calling him out.
[00:33:27.340 --> 00:33:29.260]   So if you take his side,
[00:33:29.260 --> 00:33:32.460]   he said, we're gonna kick you out of the synagogue.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:35.940]   And so in fear of being kicked out of the synagogue,
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:37.380]   they basically were plain dumb.
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:40.740]   Well, he's our son, we can't deny that he was born blind,
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:43.480]   but as to how his eyes were opened, we can't say.
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.220]   Now again, it's helpful for us to understand
[00:33:47.220 --> 00:33:49.460]   what the synagogue meant for an average Jew.
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:52.100]   Because the synagogue was not just a place
[00:33:52.100 --> 00:33:53.820]   where you went to worship.
[00:33:53.820 --> 00:33:55.940]   Synagogue was your community.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:58.340]   Synagogue was where your children were educated.
[00:33:58.340 --> 00:34:00.440]   That was also your school.
[00:34:00.440 --> 00:34:02.380]   Synagogue was where you went
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:05.700]   and you probably married within that context.
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:08.940]   So synagogue to them was their world.
[00:34:08.940 --> 00:34:11.580]   So if you were kicked out of the synagogue,
[00:34:11.580 --> 00:34:13.960]   not only would you have spiritual ramification,
[00:34:13.960 --> 00:34:15.380]   not only would you have ramification
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:17.180]   for the education of your children,
[00:34:17.180 --> 00:34:20.280]   you wouldn't be able to do any kind of business.
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.420]   Because anybody who does business with that person,
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:24.260]   anybody who supports that person,
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:25.740]   anybody who relates to that person
[00:34:25.740 --> 00:34:28.700]   would also be kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:30.420]   So they had this tight rein,
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:32.460]   they had this power over the synagogue,
[00:34:32.460 --> 00:34:35.660]   and these men basically were saying,
[00:34:35.660 --> 00:34:40.380]   we've labeled him to be a troublemaker, and he's a sinner.
[00:34:40.380 --> 00:34:43.000]   So anybody who supports him in any way
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:44.260]   will be kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:48.140]   Now all of that was a setup to verse chapter 10.
[00:34:48.140 --> 00:34:51.220]   For this reason, verse 23, the parents said,
[00:34:51.220 --> 00:34:52.680]   he is of age, ask him.
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:34:54.380]   So a second time they called the man
[00:34:54.380 --> 00:34:56.300]   who had been blind and said to him,
[00:34:56.300 --> 00:34:59.500]   give glory to God, we know that this man is a sinner.
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.860]   He then answered, whether he's a sinner, I do not know.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:05.740]   One thing I do know that though I was blind, now I see.
[00:35:05.740 --> 00:35:10.500]   Verse 26, so they said to him, what did he do to you?
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:11.740]   How did he open your eyes?
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.820]   He answered him, I told you already.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:16.080]   You can kind of see, he knows that he's not gonna
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:17.400]   get through to them.
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:19.040]   What he's telling them, I already told you
[00:35:19.040 --> 00:35:19.880]   that I was born blind.
[00:35:19.880 --> 00:35:22.400]   My parents told you I was born blind, and I see.
[00:35:22.400 --> 00:35:25.480]   And clearly you're not going to accept my answer.
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:27.840]   He said, I already told you, and you did not listen.
[00:35:27.840 --> 00:35:29.720]   Why do you want to hear it again?
[00:35:29.720 --> 00:35:32.920]   You do not want to become his disciples too, do you?
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:37.540]   Sarcasm, so if you don't know what sarcasm is,
[00:35:37.540 --> 00:35:39.540]   right there, lesson one, that's sarcasm.
[00:35:40.440 --> 00:35:43.120]   I mean, think about this man's position.
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:49.220]   He was born blind all his life, and his lot in life
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:51.440]   was to be a beggar all his life.
[00:35:51.440 --> 00:35:54.260]   So can you imagine not being able to see,
[00:35:54.260 --> 00:35:58.580]   and hearing the whole community of people going back
[00:35:58.580 --> 00:36:02.420]   and forth into the temple with their animals to sacrifice?
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:05.220]   Families, husband and wives, laughing with their children,
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.920]   going back and forth.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.600]   So can you imagine him being forced to be on the side
[00:36:11.600 --> 00:36:13.720]   of the street begging all of his life?
[00:36:13.720 --> 00:36:19.560]   So for him to open his eyes wasn't simply that now I can see
[00:36:19.560 --> 00:36:21.580]   and function like a normal person.
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:25.120]   For a blind man, a Jewish blind man,
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:27.940]   to have his eyes open means that he can enter back
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.640]   into society, and in order to enter back into society,
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:34.680]   he needed the approval of these Pharisees.
[00:36:36.360 --> 00:36:38.560]   So you can see the boldness of this man.
[00:36:38.560 --> 00:36:41.000]   Now he's standing against these Pharisees
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.080]   who really holds the key, at least humanly speaking,
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:45.740]   for a good life for him.
[00:36:45.740 --> 00:36:49.160]   He may be able to, he'll always be known as that guy
[00:36:49.160 --> 00:36:51.800]   who used to beg, and God performed a miracle on him.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:56.800]   He's able to now find a wife, possibly, have children,
[00:36:56.800 --> 00:36:59.600]   get a normal job, be able to worship at the synagogue,
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.160]   raise his children.
[00:37:01.160 --> 00:37:05.320]   He must have had all of those thoughts in his head.
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:09.240]   But he's standing before these men who have the key
[00:37:09.240 --> 00:37:12.760]   to good life for him, and now he realizes
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.040]   that he's not gonna get through to them,
[00:37:14.040 --> 00:37:15.800]   so he's basically challenging them.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:21.000]   Why are you so stubborn, and why do you refuse to see this?
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.160]   In verse 30, the man answered and said to them,
[00:37:23.160 --> 00:37:26.240]   well, here is an amazing thing that you do not know
[00:37:26.240 --> 00:37:29.080]   where he is from, and yet he opened my eyes.
[00:37:29.080 --> 00:37:31.640]   We know that God does not hear sinners,
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:35.440]   but if anyone is God-fearing and does his will,
[00:37:35.440 --> 00:37:36.540]   he hears him.
[00:37:36.540 --> 00:37:39.080]   Since the beginning of time, it has never been heard
[00:37:39.080 --> 00:37:42.120]   that anyone opened the eyes of the person born blind.
[00:37:42.120 --> 00:37:45.260]   If this man were not from God, he could do nothing.
[00:37:45.260 --> 00:37:48.240]   They answered him, you were born entirely in sins,
[00:37:48.240 --> 00:37:49.400]   and are you teaching us?
[00:37:49.400 --> 00:37:51.640]   So they put him out.
[00:37:51.640 --> 00:37:53.720]   Look at that conversation.
[00:37:53.720 --> 00:37:57.000]   Here's a man, if he was blind, he probably had never
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   had any kind of education, never had any kind of training.
[00:38:00.840 --> 00:38:04.320]   He was a beggar all his life, since he was a young child,
[00:38:04.320 --> 00:38:07.420]   and yet he's the one trying to open their eyes spiritually.
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:11.160]   So he may have been the one physically blind all his life,
[00:38:11.160 --> 00:38:13.640]   but spiritually, he was seeing clearly.
[00:38:13.640 --> 00:38:16.760]   And here's these men who had the access to his word,
[00:38:16.760 --> 00:38:19.920]   who were the teachers of the law at the synagogue,
[00:38:19.920 --> 00:38:23.320]   who were the leaders of the spiritual community,
[00:38:23.320 --> 00:38:24.640]   and yet they did not understand
[00:38:24.640 --> 00:38:26.680]   what was plainly in front of them.
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:30.940]   And as a result of challenging these people,
[00:38:30.940 --> 00:38:33.520]   they did exactly what everybody was afraid of,
[00:38:33.520 --> 00:38:36.840]   what his parents were afraid of, they put him out.
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:40.920]   And it is in this context that Jesus meets up with this man
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:42.200]   who's just been put out.
[00:38:42.200 --> 00:38:46.280]   He now sees, but because he can't participate in society,
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.400]   he may still have to beg.
[00:38:48.400 --> 00:38:50.320]   He's not gonna be able to get a job.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:51.920]   He's not gonna be able to go to the synagogue.
[00:38:51.920 --> 00:38:53.680]   He won't be welcomed at the temple.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:56.640]   And Jesus meets him in verse 35.
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:38:59.580]   Jesus heard that they had put him out and finding him,
[00:38:59.580 --> 00:39:01.920]   he said, "Do you believe in the Son of Man?"
[00:39:01.920 --> 00:39:05.520]   He answered, "Who is he, Lord, that I may believe in him?"
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:07.640]   Jesus said to him, "You have both seen him,
[00:39:07.640 --> 00:39:10.400]   "and he is the one who is talking with you."
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:12.800]   And he said, "Lord, I believe."
[00:39:12.800 --> 00:39:14.420]   And he worshiped him, and Jesus said,
[00:39:14.420 --> 00:39:16.640]   "For judgment, I came into this world,
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:18.940]   "so that those who do not see may see,
[00:39:18.940 --> 00:39:23.040]   "and those who may see may become blind."
[00:39:23.040 --> 00:39:24.880]   And then in verse 40,
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:26.480]   those of the Pharisees who were with him
[00:39:26.480 --> 00:39:27.920]   heard these things and said to him,
[00:39:27.920 --> 00:39:30.120]   "We are not blind, too, are we?"
[00:39:30.120 --> 00:39:32.340]   Jesus said to them, "If you were blind,
[00:39:32.340 --> 00:39:33.940]   "you would have no sin,
[00:39:33.940 --> 00:39:38.120]   "but since you say, we see your sin remains."
[00:39:38.120 --> 00:39:39.720]   All right.
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:42.000]   All of that was an introduction,
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.640]   because it's difficult to understand
[00:39:45.640 --> 00:39:47.300]   what he says in the next statement
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:49.120]   without understanding chapter nine.
[00:39:49.120 --> 00:39:51.760]   When he says he is the door,
[00:39:51.760 --> 00:39:54.120]   now I hope you're already thinking,
[00:39:54.120 --> 00:39:56.200]   I hope you're already making the connection.
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.400]   When he's saying I am the door,
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:02.360]   he's saying the Jews are not.
[00:40:02.360 --> 00:40:05.040]   And that's why chapter 10, verse one,
[00:40:05.040 --> 00:40:09.280]   begins with an indictment of the Jewish leaders,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:12.560]   that they are not the door to eternal life,
[00:40:12.560 --> 00:40:13.520]   that they are not the door.
[00:40:13.520 --> 00:40:15.600]   The synagogue is not the door
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:17.400]   for your refuge and your safety.
[00:40:17.400 --> 00:40:19.400]   So what I wanna do, again,
[00:40:19.400 --> 00:40:23.320]   these three observations of what Jesus says in chapter 10
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   about these two statements,
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:25.680]   about him being the door and the shepherd,
[00:40:25.680 --> 00:40:27.520]   and I'm using it interchangeably,
[00:40:27.520 --> 00:40:29.640]   because that's how it's used in chapter 10.
[00:40:29.640 --> 00:40:32.960]   And it's all as in response to the Jewish leaders
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.340]   kicking out this blind man for stating the truth.
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:40.320]   First thing that he says, an indictment against the Jews,
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:43.080]   Jesus is the owner and not a hired hand.
[00:40:43.080 --> 00:40:47.480]   Again, this is an indictment against the leaders.
[00:40:47.480 --> 00:40:50.120]   Verse 10, chapter 10, verse one.
[00:40:50.120 --> 00:40:51.460]   "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.440]   "he who does not enter by the door
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:55.280]   "into the fold of the sheep,
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:57.640]   "but climbs up some other way,
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:00.080]   "he is a thief and a robber."
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.280]   Now, who is he referring to?
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.760]   Clearly, he's talking about the Pharisees.
[00:41:05.760 --> 00:41:07.440]   He's talking about these leaders,
[00:41:07.440 --> 00:41:09.940]   that they are standing in the position
[00:41:09.940 --> 00:41:12.080]   of proclaiming the word of God,
[00:41:12.080 --> 00:41:15.240]   but they were never appointed by God himself.
[00:41:15.240 --> 00:41:17.920]   They were thieves who didn't come through the door,
[00:41:17.920 --> 00:41:20.680]   and they basically forced their way into leadership.
[00:41:21.660 --> 00:41:25.060]   Now, all throughout Israel's history,
[00:41:25.060 --> 00:41:28.580]   one of the primary indictments against the nation of Israel
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:32.040]   almost always started with the leaders going astray.
[00:41:32.040 --> 00:41:35.820]   People that God did not anoint speaking.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:40.280]   The people that God did not call self-willed themselves.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:43.020]   Maybe through some family ties,
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.460]   maybe through some sort of revolt,
[00:41:45.460 --> 00:41:48.520]   maybe through education, maybe through talent,
[00:41:48.520 --> 00:41:50.320]   but it wasn't God-ordained.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:53.760]   In fact, if you wanna read details about that,
[00:41:53.760 --> 00:41:55.740]   Jeremiah is a really good book to see
[00:41:55.740 --> 00:41:59.280]   what God thinks of Israel's leaders,
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:01.580]   because the passage that I'm gonna read to you,
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:04.200]   you can find it in dozens and dozens and dozens
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:06.680]   of other passages, but I'm gonna choose only one
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.380]   for the sake of time.
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:09.740]   Jeremiah 14, 14.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:11.880]   Then the Lord said to me,
[00:42:11.880 --> 00:42:15.900]   "The prophets are prophesying falsehood in my name.
[00:42:15.900 --> 00:42:17.980]   "I have neither sent them nor commanded them
[00:42:17.980 --> 00:42:19.620]   "nor spoken to them.
[00:42:19.620 --> 00:42:23.000]   "They are prophesying to you false visions,
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   "divinations, futility, and a deception of their own mind."
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:31.340]   In other words, they're thinking to themselves,
[00:42:31.340 --> 00:42:32.180]   "What should I say?
[00:42:32.180 --> 00:42:33.940]   "What can I say?"
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.100]   Instead of speaking the truth,
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:38.300]   they're speaking what they think is important,
[00:42:38.300 --> 00:42:39.620]   what maybe you want to hear,
[00:42:39.620 --> 00:42:41.780]   and that's exactly what Paul says to Timothy,
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:44.060]   that in times that people aren't gonna want
[00:42:44.060 --> 00:42:46.060]   to hear the truth.
[00:42:46.060 --> 00:42:47.860]   Sometimes the truth is encouraging,
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.340]   and sometimes the truth is cutting.
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:52.100]   But he said, "They're not gonna put up
[00:42:52.100 --> 00:42:53.560]   "with the cutting part,
[00:42:53.560 --> 00:42:55.700]   "and they're gonna gather around themselves leaders
[00:42:55.700 --> 00:42:57.380]   "who want to tickle their itching ears."
[00:42:57.380 --> 00:42:59.660]   And this was not a problem only of the end times.
[00:42:59.660 --> 00:43:01.040]   We see in the Old Testament,
[00:43:01.040 --> 00:43:04.580]   this was a continual problem with the nation of Israel.
[00:43:04.580 --> 00:43:07.640]   These false teachers were forcing their way
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.620]   into leadership, and they weren't speaking for God.
[00:43:10.620 --> 00:43:14.660]   He says that they have come to rob and to steal.
[00:43:14.660 --> 00:43:17.580]   In Matthew 7, 15, "Beware of the false prophets
[00:43:17.580 --> 00:43:19.500]   "who come to you in sheep's clothing,
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:23.240]   "but inwardly are ravenous wolves."
[00:43:23.240 --> 00:43:25.620]   Well, how are they thieves?
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:26.740]   Well, first of all, they're thieves
[00:43:26.740 --> 00:43:28.920]   because they rob God of his glory.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:33.820]   The reason why they jump in and try to be leaders
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:37.820]   is for self-exaltation, self-glorification.
[00:43:37.820 --> 00:43:39.660]   Even though they talk about God,
[00:43:39.660 --> 00:43:42.300]   ultimately it's about themselves.
[00:43:42.300 --> 00:43:43.580]   They're not willing to be in the back.
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:44.600]   They're not willing to serve.
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:47.400]   They're not willing to be in the shadows.
[00:43:47.400 --> 00:43:50.700]   Their primary reason to be leader
[00:43:50.700 --> 00:43:52.740]   is so that they can rob God of his glory
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:56.120]   in the name of Christ.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:43:59.340]   But they also rob people of access to truth
[00:43:59.340 --> 00:44:00.220]   and to God's glory.
[00:44:00.220 --> 00:44:02.860]   So not only do they rob God, they rob the sheep
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:05.360]   because they stand in a place
[00:44:05.360 --> 00:44:07.920]   where they supposedly speak for God,
[00:44:07.920 --> 00:44:10.580]   but ultimately bring glory to themselves.
[00:44:10.580 --> 00:44:13.780]   In fact, it goes a bit further in John 10, 12-13.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:17.840]   It says, "He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd,
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.780]   "who is not the owner of the sheep,"
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:22.100]   again, the Israel's leaders,
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:25.940]   "sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.
[00:44:25.940 --> 00:44:28.300]   "And the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
[00:44:28.300 --> 00:44:30.240]   "He flees because he is a hired hand
[00:44:30.240 --> 00:44:33.420]   "and he's not concerned about the sheep."
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:34.680]   In other words, what he is saying is
[00:44:34.680 --> 00:44:36.580]   you're not safe under their leadership
[00:44:36.580 --> 00:44:40.160]   because they're there for themselves.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:45.160]   So if you being there helps them,
[00:44:45.160 --> 00:44:48.140]   then they might be benevolent.
[00:44:48.140 --> 00:44:49.420]   They might be there serving you.
[00:44:49.420 --> 00:44:52.300]   But as soon as, his life is in danger,
[00:44:52.300 --> 00:44:54.060]   as soon as it doesn't benefit him,
[00:44:54.060 --> 00:44:56.660]   he packs up and he leaves.
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:44:58.780]   So in other words, he's warning them,
[00:44:58.780 --> 00:44:59.920]   you're not safe there.
[00:44:59.920 --> 00:45:01.380]   Now, why is he saying this?
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:05.520]   Because of what just happened in chapter nine.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:08.940]   The nation of Israel was living in fear
[00:45:08.940 --> 00:45:10.860]   of being kicked out of the synagogue.
[00:45:10.860 --> 00:45:14.880]   And so they were jumping over hoops,
[00:45:14.880 --> 00:45:16.220]   obeying all of these laws.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.460]   And many of them probably were looking at that and said,
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:23.460]   "Well, the Sabbath law is ridiculous.
[00:45:23.460 --> 00:45:25.380]   "That we can walk 300 feet,
[00:45:25.380 --> 00:45:29.240]   "but as soon as we walk 301 feet, we broke the Sabbath?
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.420]   "That we can feed the donkey,
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:33.120]   "but we can't feed the poor man?
[00:45:33.120 --> 00:45:35.540]   "These laws don't make any sense."
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.420]   But if you went against the leadership
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:39.140]   and you questioned them,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:40.420]   you get kicked out of the synagogue
[00:45:40.420 --> 00:45:42.860]   and basically your life is ruined.
[00:45:42.860 --> 00:45:44.700]   And that's why the first thing that he does,
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:47.220]   he brings indictment against the nation of Israel.
[00:45:47.220 --> 00:45:49.300]   That's not where life is.
[00:45:49.300 --> 00:45:55.260]   See, shepherds who don't have ownership
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.220]   and who are only there for his own glory,
[00:45:58.220 --> 00:46:01.100]   when the wolf comes, he will flee.
[00:46:01.100 --> 00:46:04.180]   They don't ache for the people.
[00:46:04.180 --> 00:46:07.020]   They don't cry out for those who are hurting or drifting.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.380]   They've never had compassion for the lost.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:12.680]   It was just a legalistic duty.
[00:46:12.680 --> 00:46:16.340]   And it was, you know, one way to bring glory to himself
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:17.220]   is to go out into the world,
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:19.900]   make a lot of money, become famous.
[00:46:19.900 --> 00:46:24.700]   Or another way to do that is become a leader in the church,
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:25.760]   get a good reputation,
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:28.160]   have many people who may honor you.
[00:46:28.160 --> 00:46:31.300]   They're seeking their self-glory,
[00:46:31.300 --> 00:46:34.160]   except they're just doing it in the church.
[00:46:34.160 --> 00:46:36.560]   We have countless, countless examples
[00:46:36.560 --> 00:46:37.860]   throughout church history,
[00:46:37.860 --> 00:46:39.640]   how the church became corrupt
[00:46:39.640 --> 00:46:41.680]   because of these false leaders.
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:47.540]   In contrast, we see Jesus in Matthew 9, 36,
[00:46:47.540 --> 00:46:50.460]   seeing the people, he felt compassion for them
[00:46:50.460 --> 00:46:53.000]   because they were distressed and dispirited
[00:46:53.000 --> 00:46:55.040]   like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:46:55.040 --> 00:46:58.140]   In other words, why did he feel compassion?
[00:46:58.140 --> 00:47:03.100]   Jesus had compassion because those sheep were his.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:06.160]   They weren't just bad news
[00:47:06.160 --> 00:47:08.100]   that he was seeing on television.
[00:47:08.100 --> 00:47:10.800]   Like you can hear horrific things and say,
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:13.680]   "Oh, I feel bad," and then you just press dislike.
[00:47:13.680 --> 00:47:15.680]   But that's usually where it ends
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:18.840]   because we don't have a personal connection with that.
[00:47:18.840 --> 00:47:21.380]   But it's a whole different story when it's our kids,
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.960]   when it's my uncle, when it's my dad, my brother.
[00:47:23.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   So Jesus says he had compassion
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:29.200]   because he's a true shepherd.
[00:47:29.200 --> 00:47:31.720]   And those are his sheep, John 10, 2-3.
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:35.180]   But he who enters by the door is a shepherd of the sheep.
[00:47:35.180 --> 00:47:36.980]   To him, the doorkeeper opens.
[00:47:36.980 --> 00:47:41.300]   In other words, God has an ordained path.
[00:47:41.300 --> 00:47:43.060]   And you know that he's the shepherd
[00:47:43.060 --> 00:47:45.620]   because God has been preparing for him to come
[00:47:45.620 --> 00:47:47.780]   for generations.
[00:47:47.780 --> 00:47:52.180]   He sent magi, prophets, angels,
[00:47:52.180 --> 00:47:55.020]   and even John the Baptist to go ahead of them,
[00:47:55.020 --> 00:47:58.220]   prepare and to ordain so that the door
[00:47:58.220 --> 00:48:01.060]   that Jesus comes through may be wide open.
[00:48:01.060 --> 00:48:02.840]   And the reason why he's saying that is
[00:48:02.840 --> 00:48:04.840]   you will recognize who the good shepherd is
[00:48:04.840 --> 00:48:06.720]   because he will come through the door
[00:48:06.720 --> 00:48:09.280]   that has been opened by God himself.
[00:48:09.280 --> 00:48:13.920]   And that's the reason that we see in Matthew 3-15
[00:48:13.920 --> 00:48:16.100]   when John the Baptist, whose whole purpose
[00:48:16.100 --> 00:48:18.440]   was to prepare the way for the coming of Christ,
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:21.120]   Jesus comes out, and what's the first thing that he does
[00:48:21.120 --> 00:48:22.920]   before he enters ministry?
[00:48:22.920 --> 00:48:26.460]   He gets baptized by John the Baptist.
[00:48:26.460 --> 00:48:28.480]   John the Baptist looks at him and says,
[00:48:28.480 --> 00:48:30.740]   "My whole ministry was to prepare for you.
[00:48:30.740 --> 00:48:35.120]   "I'm unworthy to even untie your sandals.
[00:48:35.120 --> 00:48:37.420]   "Why would I be baptized by you?"
[00:48:37.420 --> 00:48:40.640]   And he says, "This must be done to fulfill
[00:48:40.640 --> 00:48:43.200]   "all righteousness."
[00:48:43.200 --> 00:48:45.100]   In other words, Jesus himself was coming
[00:48:45.100 --> 00:48:46.500]   through the front door.
[00:48:46.500 --> 00:48:49.320]   He was coming through the door that was prepared
[00:48:49.320 --> 00:48:51.600]   by the prophets, the magi, the angels,
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:53.480]   and John the Baptist.
[00:48:53.480 --> 00:48:55.960]   So when you see the Son of Man coming through the door
[00:48:55.960 --> 00:48:58.280]   that God had opened, you know that that was
[00:48:58.280 --> 00:49:00.960]   a good shepherd that God had prepared.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:05.040]   Number two, not only is he the owner,
[00:49:05.040 --> 00:49:08.960]   Jesus knows his sheep, and his sheep know him.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:12.520]   In John chapter 10, three to five,
[00:49:12.520 --> 00:49:16.000]   to him the doorkeeper opens and the sheep hear his voice,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.180]   and he calls his own sheep by name and leads them out.
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:25.180]   Now I have a really, I think, appropriate video
[00:49:25.380 --> 00:49:27.360]   that I want you to watch, and it's only about
[00:49:27.360 --> 00:49:29.200]   a minute and a half, okay?
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:31.480]   So if we can watch that for a minute
[00:49:31.480 --> 00:49:32.580]   before I jump back in.
[00:49:32.580 --> 00:49:36.060]   (gentle music)
[00:49:36.060 --> 00:49:39.980]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:49:39.980 --> 00:49:43.900]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:49:43.900 --> 00:49:46.480]   (gentle music)
[00:49:46.480 --> 00:49:52.560]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:49:52.560 --> 00:50:05.700]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:50:05.700 --> 00:50:12.200]   (sheep bleating)
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.120]   (speaking in foreign language)
[00:50:16.120 --> 00:50:21.380]   (sheep bleating)
[00:50:21.380 --> 00:50:29.560]   Okay, let me stop right there, all right.
[00:50:29.560 --> 00:50:31.600]   For those of you who are here who didn't hear the sound,
[00:50:31.600 --> 00:50:33.480]   okay, basically the three children were trying
[00:50:33.480 --> 00:50:35.000]   to get the attention of the sheep,
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.160]   and the sheep don't recognize the voice,
[00:50:37.160 --> 00:50:38.320]   so they don't move.
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:40.540]   But you notice when the farmer, the shepherd comes,
[00:50:40.540 --> 00:50:43.260]   the owner, and he begins to make sound,
[00:50:43.260 --> 00:50:46.460]   if you could see it, the sheep all of a sudden perk up.
[00:50:46.460 --> 00:50:48.400]   As soon as they hear his voice, they perk up,
[00:50:48.400 --> 00:50:50.360]   and you can see all of them just kind of perking up,
[00:50:50.360 --> 00:50:51.920]   and then he begins to call,
[00:50:51.920 --> 00:50:55.040]   and they all just kind of swarm at him, all right?
[00:50:55.040 --> 00:50:59.160]   So Jesus, knowing the context of the farmers,
[00:50:59.160 --> 00:51:00.920]   the agriculture culture that people
[00:51:00.920 --> 00:51:02.880]   would have easily understood,
[00:51:02.880 --> 00:51:05.360]   he's using that as saying, he says,
[00:51:05.360 --> 00:51:08.740]   when the true shepherd comes,
[00:51:08.740 --> 00:51:11.560]   you will be able to recognize his voice.
[00:51:11.560 --> 00:51:13.620]   In verse four, when he puts forth all his own,
[00:51:13.620 --> 00:51:15.900]   he goes ahead of them, and the sheep follow him
[00:51:15.900 --> 00:51:18.640]   because they know his voice.
[00:51:18.640 --> 00:51:20.720]   A stranger, they simply will not follow,
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:23.400]   but will flee from him because they do not know
[00:51:23.400 --> 00:51:24.580]   the voice of the stranger.
[00:51:24.580 --> 00:51:27.140]   And he repeatedly says, he knows them, he knows them.
[00:51:27.140 --> 00:51:29.480]   They know him, they know him.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:32.920]   And the word know here isn't talking about knowledge.
[00:51:32.920 --> 00:51:36.440]   The sheep didn't raise their head and say,
[00:51:36.440 --> 00:51:38.200]   huh, he's wearing that same jacket.
[00:51:38.900 --> 00:51:41.320]   You know, everything that we know about this man,
[00:51:41.320 --> 00:51:42.820]   he seems to fit that knowledge.
[00:51:42.820 --> 00:51:46.380]   He's not talking about an academic knowledge
[00:51:46.380 --> 00:51:47.740]   of the shepherd.
[00:51:47.740 --> 00:51:51.660]   He's not talking about that he had written bio,
[00:51:51.660 --> 00:51:54.380]   a resume of all of his sheep.
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.360]   He's talking about an intimate relationship,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:01.100]   a personal intimate knowledge of each sheep.
[00:52:01.100 --> 00:52:04.140]   And so he knows them, and they know him,
[00:52:04.140 --> 00:52:05.380]   and the Bible says that.
[00:52:06.300 --> 00:52:09.120]   He said, he counts every hair on our head.
[00:52:09.120 --> 00:52:11.480]   You know, if somebody says something like that to me,
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:13.280]   if another human being says that to me,
[00:52:13.280 --> 00:52:17.080]   I know your sentiment, but it's a hyperbole.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:18.240]   It's an exaggeration.
[00:52:18.240 --> 00:52:20.200]   There's no way you know the number of hair on my head.
[00:52:20.200 --> 00:52:22.360]   I mean, I don't know how many are gonna fall off today.
[00:52:22.360 --> 00:52:24.920]   So there's no way you would know, right?
[00:52:24.920 --> 00:52:29.180]   But when God says, I know every strand of hair on your head,
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:32.820]   you know that he knows the exact number.
[00:52:32.820 --> 00:52:33.920]   He knows.
[00:52:33.920 --> 00:52:35.640]   He knows when we were born.
[00:52:35.640 --> 00:52:37.140]   He knows when we're gonna die.
[00:52:37.140 --> 00:52:40.400]   He knows what kind of life we're gonna live.
[00:52:40.400 --> 00:52:42.360]   He knows what kind of sickness.
[00:52:42.360 --> 00:52:44.120]   He knows our hardship.
[00:52:44.120 --> 00:52:46.080]   He knows our anxieties.
[00:52:46.080 --> 00:52:47.960]   He knows our fears.
[00:52:47.960 --> 00:52:49.820]   He knows when we're full.
[00:52:49.820 --> 00:52:51.920]   He knows when we're hungry.
[00:52:51.920 --> 00:52:54.200]   He knows when we're dejected.
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.560]   He knows when we feel hopeless.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:52:59.320]   He knows when we're caught in a trap of our sins,
[00:52:59.320 --> 00:53:02.000]   and he knows how to lead us out of that.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:05.720]   That's what he means when he says he knows his sheep.
[00:53:05.720 --> 00:53:06.760]   He knows us well.
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:09.560]   He's not some stranger standing far off,
[00:53:09.560 --> 00:53:12.840]   making loud noises, say, if you hear his noise, come to me.
[00:53:12.840 --> 00:53:14.800]   He says, no, he knows us.
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:18.320]   He knows our struggles, and he approaches us.
[00:53:18.320 --> 00:53:23.320]   And that's why he says, my sheep know me.
[00:53:23.320 --> 00:53:26.620]   They know my voice, and they follow.
[00:53:26.620 --> 00:53:29.400]   Why do they follow?
[00:53:29.400 --> 00:53:31.760]   Because when we hear his voice,
[00:53:31.760 --> 00:53:33.440]   why do the sheep follow the shepherd's voice
[00:53:33.440 --> 00:53:35.280]   and not the other children?
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:38.160]   Because that shepherd is the one who feeds them.
[00:53:38.160 --> 00:53:41.080]   That shepherd is the one who takes care of them.
[00:53:41.080 --> 00:53:42.640]   In Mark chapter 13, 22, it says,
[00:53:42.640 --> 00:53:45.480]   "For false cries and false prophets will arise
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:49.280]   and will show signs and wonders in order to lead astray,
[00:53:49.280 --> 00:53:52.200]   if possible, the elect."
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:53.840]   You know why he says if possible?
[00:53:53.840 --> 00:53:56.940]   Because he's saying it's not possible.
[00:53:56.940 --> 00:53:59.760]   In other words, there's gonna be a lot of people
[00:53:59.760 --> 00:54:02.760]   who may pose to be the elect,
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:07.040]   but when the true deception comes, they may also fall.
[00:54:07.040 --> 00:54:08.400]   But they're not the true elect.
[00:54:08.400 --> 00:54:10.120]   That's what he means by that.
[00:54:10.120 --> 00:54:12.380]   Because those who are of his,
[00:54:12.380 --> 00:54:16.320]   when they hear their Savior's voice, they recognize him.
[00:54:16.320 --> 00:54:21.780]   Just even application of our own lives.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:23.160]   How did you come to Christ?
[00:54:23.160 --> 00:54:26.960]   In some way, in some form,
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   whether it was preaching from the pulpit,
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:31.080]   whether it was somebody who shared with you one-on-one,
[00:54:31.080 --> 00:54:32.800]   maybe some of you heard the gospel
[00:54:32.800 --> 00:54:34.800]   from somebody out on the street.
[00:54:34.800 --> 00:54:38.340]   Maybe you just read a book about the gospel.
[00:54:38.340 --> 00:54:40.400]   Maybe you went to a conference.
[00:54:40.400 --> 00:54:42.080]   We don't know.
[00:54:42.080 --> 00:54:45.160]   But at some point, all of us heard his voice.
[00:54:45.160 --> 00:54:48.720]   And we recognized him as our shepherd.
[00:54:48.720 --> 00:54:49.880]   And we believed.
[00:54:49.880 --> 00:54:55.360]   You didn't go to three, four years of apologetic classes.
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:58.120]   You didn't understand your faith that you do now
[00:54:58.120 --> 00:55:01.800]   about how the Bible came to us and fulfilled prophecies
[00:55:01.800 --> 00:55:04.440]   and God's inerrant word, his own very breath
[00:55:04.440 --> 00:55:07.040]   and experiences that you've had with Christ.
[00:55:07.040 --> 00:55:10.120]   You didn't have knowledge of all of that.
[00:55:10.120 --> 00:55:12.920]   But somehow, you heard his voice
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:15.920]   and you recognized that he's your maker.
[00:55:15.920 --> 00:55:18.500]   You recognized the shepherd's voice,
[00:55:18.500 --> 00:55:21.240]   and that's why we followed him,
[00:55:21.240 --> 00:55:23.840]   even as he told us to pick up our cross,
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.720]   even as hardship came into our lives.
[00:55:28.000 --> 00:55:30.720]   We recognize his voice and we follow him.
[00:55:30.720 --> 00:55:33.520]   That's why the primary goal of the church,
[00:55:33.520 --> 00:55:36.080]   the primary goal of the under-shepherd
[00:55:36.080 --> 00:55:38.800]   is to make his voice clear.
[00:55:38.800 --> 00:55:42.440]   If I stand up here for years and years and tell you
[00:55:42.440 --> 00:55:43.920]   because I lived longer than you
[00:55:43.920 --> 00:55:45.780]   that you should listen to me,
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:48.120]   I'm telling you, don't listen to me.
[00:55:48.120 --> 00:55:50.440]   I'm telling you right off the bat, don't listen to me.
[00:55:50.440 --> 00:55:53.640]   If I stand here and say, because I've been a pastor
[00:55:53.640 --> 00:55:56.780]   and I've been leading a church for almost 30 years,
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:55:58.160]   I have much more experience than you,
[00:55:58.160 --> 00:55:59.840]   so you need to listen to me.
[00:55:59.840 --> 00:56:01.520]   Don't listen to me.
[00:56:01.520 --> 00:56:03.240]   Because there's people who've done ministry
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.960]   50 years more than I did.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.720]   Maybe not 50 years, that'd be a long time, right?
[00:56:07.720 --> 00:56:10.360]   Or 50 years compared to my 30 years,
[00:56:10.360 --> 00:56:12.080]   so then you should listen to him.
[00:56:12.080 --> 00:56:15.040]   Oh, I went to seminary and I had education.
[00:56:15.040 --> 00:56:17.840]   Well, somebody has a PhD, then you should listen to him.
[00:56:17.840 --> 00:56:21.920]   No matter, if I put my own personal experience
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:24.840]   and my own talent, my own gift, and my own education
[00:56:24.840 --> 00:56:27.100]   as the authority that you ought to follow,
[00:56:27.100 --> 00:56:28.200]   you should not follow.
[00:56:28.200 --> 00:56:32.380]   Because the primary goal of the church
[00:56:32.380 --> 00:56:34.460]   is to make his voice clear.
[00:56:34.460 --> 00:56:37.900]   Because the primary goal of every Christian
[00:56:37.900 --> 00:56:40.580]   is to follow the shepherd, not the under shepherd,
[00:56:40.580 --> 00:56:43.120]   not the leadership.
[00:56:43.120 --> 00:56:44.800]   The goal of the leadership is to point you
[00:56:44.800 --> 00:56:47.100]   to the true shepherd, Christ.
[00:56:47.100 --> 00:56:50.260]   If our goal is to have the best organized church,
[00:56:50.260 --> 00:56:53.740]   then we should hire MBAs,
[00:56:53.740 --> 00:56:55.520]   people who've studied and got their masters
[00:56:55.520 --> 00:57:00.520]   and how to milk the most productiveness out of the church.
[00:57:00.520 --> 00:57:03.820]   If the goal of the church is branding,
[00:57:03.820 --> 00:57:05.460]   we want people to know who we are,
[00:57:05.460 --> 00:57:07.140]   and when we say bring in,
[00:57:07.140 --> 00:57:09.300]   we want the whole world to know who we are,
[00:57:09.300 --> 00:57:13.180]   then we should consult Coca-Cola.
[00:57:13.180 --> 00:57:15.540]   In our generation, they did the best job, right?
[00:57:15.540 --> 00:57:17.700]   Or Facebook, we should get people
[00:57:17.700 --> 00:57:19.740]   who are experts in branding.
[00:57:19.740 --> 00:57:23.100]   If we want to make the greatest impact in our society
[00:57:23.100 --> 00:57:27.300]   to influence people by what we think is important,
[00:57:27.300 --> 00:57:31.100]   then we should get influencers, social media influencers.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:33.780]   So if they have 30,000 followers or a million followers,
[00:57:33.780 --> 00:57:35.020]   we should recruit some of these people
[00:57:35.020 --> 00:57:36.980]   and spend some of our money asking them
[00:57:36.980 --> 00:57:38.460]   to help us be a better influence
[00:57:38.460 --> 00:57:40.220]   because somehow they figured it out.
[00:57:40.220 --> 00:57:44.060]   But if our goal is to get to God,
[00:57:44.060 --> 00:57:47.480]   the most important thing that the church needs to do
[00:57:47.480 --> 00:57:49.540]   is to make his voice clear
[00:57:50.700 --> 00:57:53.820]   so that his sheep will hear his voice
[00:57:53.820 --> 00:57:55.500]   and continue to follow him.
[00:57:55.500 --> 00:57:59.120]   That's the goal of the church.
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:03.740]   So even if all other parts of the church isn't running well,
[00:58:03.740 --> 00:58:06.380]   and I'm not saying that we shouldn't run it well,
[00:58:06.380 --> 00:58:08.280]   I'm not saying we shouldn't have influence,
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:10.780]   but the primary and the most important
[00:58:10.780 --> 00:58:13.820]   and the greatest task that we need to give all our energy to,
[00:58:13.820 --> 00:58:16.100]   our finance to, is to make sure
[00:58:16.100 --> 00:58:18.800]   that our shepherd's voice is made clear.
[00:58:20.380 --> 00:58:24.300]   All the more, as you and I are in a situation
[00:58:24.300 --> 00:58:27.620]   in a world pandemic, I lived over 50 years
[00:58:27.620 --> 00:58:28.880]   and I never experienced anything.
[00:58:28.880 --> 00:58:31.420]   Of course, I've never gone through the war physically.
[00:58:31.420 --> 00:58:33.220]   My parents' generation and that generation
[00:58:33.220 --> 00:58:34.220]   went through all kinds of wars,
[00:58:34.220 --> 00:58:36.460]   but I haven't experienced that.
[00:58:36.460 --> 00:58:39.740]   This is probably the craziest thing,
[00:58:39.740 --> 00:58:42.100]   at least most people my age or younger
[00:58:42.100 --> 00:58:43.780]   would say that they've ever seen,
[00:58:43.780 --> 00:58:45.840]   unless you've been to some kind of war.
[00:58:45.840 --> 00:58:49.660]   In this time of darkness and uncertainty,
[00:58:50.660 --> 00:58:52.500]   whose voice are we looking to?
[00:58:52.500 --> 00:58:55.140]   A lot of people are hanging on
[00:58:55.140 --> 00:58:57.020]   to every word of the governor,
[00:58:57.020 --> 00:59:00.300]   every word of the president or the doctors,
[00:59:00.300 --> 00:59:02.380]   or maybe even the lawyers,
[00:59:02.380 --> 00:59:04.940]   or sometimes the movie stars, the athletes.
[00:59:04.940 --> 00:59:06.220]   What do they have to say?
[00:59:06.220 --> 00:59:07.620]   What are they saying?
[00:59:07.620 --> 00:59:08.660]   When is it safe?
[00:59:08.660 --> 00:59:09.800]   When can we live?
[00:59:09.800 --> 00:59:13.420]   Where's the stock market going?
[00:59:13.420 --> 00:59:15.300]   Is my job gonna be okay?
[00:59:15.300 --> 00:59:19.420]   But who do we look to?
[00:59:19.420 --> 00:59:20.940]   Whose voice are we looking to?
[00:59:20.940 --> 00:59:24.300]   Do we pay attention to our shepherd's voice
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:27.140]   as much as we pay attention to the leaders of our country?
[00:59:27.140 --> 00:59:31.960]   Because all leaders ultimately are his under shepherds.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:37.300]   Third and finally, Jesus, the door, the good shepherd,
[00:59:37.300 --> 00:59:40.820]   leads us to green pastures and to abundant life.
[00:59:40.820 --> 00:59:44.060]   The reason why they hear his voice and they follow him
[00:59:44.060 --> 00:59:46.780]   is because they know that the shepherd
[00:59:46.780 --> 00:59:49.620]   is going to lead them to green pastures.
[00:59:49.620 --> 00:59:51.860]   Now, if the shepherd says something and they all run,
[00:59:51.860 --> 00:59:55.100]   and every time they run, he hits them, right?
[00:59:55.100 --> 00:59:57.820]   They're gonna hear his voice
[00:59:57.820 --> 00:59:59.620]   and they're gonna run the opposite direction.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:02.100]   They're not gonna follow him, they're gonna run from him.
[01:00:02.100 --> 01:00:04.680]   But when the shepherd says something
[01:00:04.680 --> 01:00:06.540]   and the sheep perk up and they go,
[01:00:06.540 --> 01:00:08.280]   they run to him because they know
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:10.820]   that he's going to lead them to green pastures.
[01:00:10.820 --> 01:00:13.700]   And that's why we follow.
[01:00:13.700 --> 01:00:18.000]   Sometimes the green pastures may be a path
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.780]   that you have to go through the valley to get there.
[01:00:20.780 --> 01:00:23.580]   Sometimes you have to go through wolves
[01:00:23.580 --> 01:00:27.220]   because the green pastures is on the other side.
[01:00:27.220 --> 01:00:30.500]   And that's why they cling to the shepherd
[01:00:30.500 --> 01:00:32.980]   because they know that the shepherd knows the way.
[01:00:32.980 --> 01:00:35.100]   They know that the shepherd is going to protect them.
[01:00:35.100 --> 01:00:36.940]   They know that if they stick with the shepherd,
[01:00:36.940 --> 01:00:38.920]   they're going to green pastures.
[01:00:38.920 --> 01:00:42.740]   And that's what he says in chapter 10, verse nine through 12.
[01:00:42.740 --> 01:00:43.780]   I am the door.
[01:00:43.780 --> 01:00:47.940]   If anyone enters through me, he will be saved.
[01:00:47.940 --> 01:00:49.140]   You see the door that they're trying
[01:00:49.140 --> 01:00:50.440]   to get into the synagogue?
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:53.420]   You're trying so hard and you're so afraid
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:55.300]   of being kicked out of the synagogue,
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:59.020]   but once you get in there, it's actually more dangerous
[01:00:59.020 --> 01:01:00.420]   because they're thieves.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.620]   And when danger actually comes, they're gonna leave.
[01:01:02.620 --> 01:01:06.300]   But if you come through me, he said, you will be saved.
[01:01:06.300 --> 01:01:10.520]   And we'll go in and out and find pasture.
[01:01:10.520 --> 01:01:14.820]   The thief comes only to steal and kill and to destroy.
[01:01:14.820 --> 01:01:16.220]   And who is he talking about?
[01:01:16.220 --> 01:01:18.820]   The Pharisees.
[01:01:18.820 --> 01:01:20.780]   I came that they may have life
[01:01:20.780 --> 01:01:23.540]   and have life and have it abundantly.
[01:01:23.540 --> 01:01:24.660]   I am the good shepherd.
[01:01:24.660 --> 01:01:28.500]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[01:01:28.500 --> 01:01:31.460]   You see the distinction between the shepherds,
[01:01:31.460 --> 01:01:33.900]   the fake shepherds and the real shepherd?
[01:01:33.900 --> 01:01:36.380]   The fake shepherd will lay your life down
[01:01:36.380 --> 01:01:37.940]   to protect himself.
[01:01:37.940 --> 01:01:41.300]   The good shepherd lays down his life to protect us.
[01:01:41.300 --> 01:01:47.160]   You know, one of my favorite passages
[01:01:47.160 --> 01:01:49.640]   and favorite parts of the gospel message is this part
[01:01:49.640 --> 01:01:52.800]   where he says that I have come to give life
[01:01:52.800 --> 01:01:54.640]   and to give it abundantly.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:56.960]   He didn't just give life.
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:59.920]   He didn't just get people who are gonna die
[01:01:59.920 --> 01:02:02.840]   and go to hell and be punished forever.
[01:02:02.840 --> 01:02:04.880]   And then he just kind of like reluctantly saved us
[01:02:04.880 --> 01:02:06.480]   and said, okay, now you don't have to go.
[01:02:06.480 --> 01:02:08.460]   He changed the line for us.
[01:02:08.460 --> 01:02:09.380]   Now we can get to heaven.
[01:02:09.380 --> 01:02:11.500]   He says, I have come to give life
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:13.660]   and to give this life abundantly.
[01:02:13.660 --> 01:02:16.020]   So sometimes we focus on the life
[01:02:16.020 --> 01:02:19.380]   and we miss the whole part of being abundant
[01:02:19.380 --> 01:02:23.300]   because the part of life, the point of life
[01:02:23.300 --> 01:02:26.420]   is the abundant life, not just life.
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.440]   Because sometimes we think of life as just not dying.
[01:02:29.440 --> 01:02:33.300]   Sometimes we think of life as just not being punished,
[01:02:33.300 --> 01:02:35.100]   not going to hell.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:38.900]   He said the whole point of why he came
[01:02:38.900 --> 01:02:42.320]   and why his sheep hears his voice and they follow him
[01:02:42.320 --> 01:02:44.220]   is so that he may lead them to green pasture
[01:02:44.220 --> 01:02:46.680]   so they may have life abundant.
[01:02:46.680 --> 01:02:50.220]   In 2 Peter 1:11, it says, for in this way,
[01:02:50.220 --> 01:02:52.460]   the entrance into the eternal kingdom of the Lord
[01:02:52.460 --> 01:02:56.420]   and Savior Jesus Christ will be abundantly supplied to you.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:03:00.060]   In other words, it's gonna be crystal clear.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:02.340]   Everything that you need for a life of godliness
[01:03:02.340 --> 01:03:03.400]   has been given to you.
[01:03:03.400 --> 01:03:06.580]   God did not give you bits and pieces and tease us.
[01:03:06.580 --> 01:03:08.900]   He's not playing hide and seek.
[01:03:08.900 --> 01:03:10.500]   That if you find me under the rock,
[01:03:10.500 --> 01:03:11.900]   if you find me in certain places
[01:03:11.900 --> 01:03:13.460]   that I'll come out and I'll bless you.
[01:03:13.460 --> 01:03:16.580]   He says, no, he said he will abundantly supply it to you.
[01:03:16.580 --> 01:03:18.780]   Neon signs, straight roads.
[01:03:18.780 --> 01:03:21.480]   And that's why, if you guys ever studied
[01:03:21.480 --> 01:03:25.620]   the cities of refuge, that's where people ran
[01:03:25.620 --> 01:03:28.780]   when they by accident killed somebody.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:30.880]   And the avenger of blood, their nearest kin,
[01:03:30.880 --> 01:03:31.880]   basically wants to kill you
[01:03:31.880 --> 01:03:34.260]   because you killed their relative.
[01:03:34.260 --> 01:03:38.500]   So out of fear, they begin to run to the city of refuge.
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:42.940]   Six cities scattered around Israel in the highest plains
[01:03:42.940 --> 01:03:46.020]   so that anyone, anywhere in Israel can see.
[01:03:46.020 --> 01:03:48.940]   And there was a constant reminder that if I'm in danger,
[01:03:48.940 --> 01:03:52.220]   I go to the city of refuge.
[01:03:52.220 --> 01:03:55.500]   All the best roads in Israel were roads
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.420]   that led them to the city of refuge
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.960]   because God commanded them to lower the mountains
[01:04:01.960 --> 01:04:04.480]   or the hills and raise the valleys.
[01:04:04.480 --> 01:04:07.400]   In other words, make the path that runs
[01:04:07.400 --> 01:04:11.280]   to the city of refuge the easiest path that they can take
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:12.920]   so that the one who is running
[01:04:12.920 --> 01:04:14.820]   will not have to go through the valleys.
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.020]   They don't have to go climb the hills.
[01:04:17.020 --> 01:04:21.000]   That they just run a straight path to the city of refuge.
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:21.940]   Now, why did he do that?
[01:04:21.940 --> 01:04:23.280]   Of course, he cared.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:25.000]   He was trying to protect somebody
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:27.280]   who accidentally killed somebody.
[01:04:27.280 --> 01:04:30.520]   But ultimately, all of that pointed to Christ.
[01:04:30.520 --> 01:04:36.480]   That the roads that lead to Christ for his sheep,
[01:04:36.480 --> 01:04:37.600]   he prepared for us.
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:40.120]   And he says he abundantly prepared for us.
[01:04:40.120 --> 01:04:43.520]   Isaiah 55, seven, let the wicked forsake his way
[01:04:43.520 --> 01:04:45.840]   and the unrighteous man his thoughts.
[01:04:45.840 --> 01:04:47.680]   And let him return to the Lord
[01:04:47.680 --> 01:04:50.560]   and he will have compassion on him and to our God
[01:04:50.560 --> 01:04:54.140]   and he will abundantly pardon.
[01:04:55.980 --> 01:04:58.320]   Do you sometimes feel like when you repent
[01:04:58.320 --> 01:05:00.600]   that God reluctantly forgave you?
[01:05:00.600 --> 01:05:04.140]   Oh my, again?
[01:05:04.140 --> 01:05:05.460]   Okay, just one more time.
[01:05:05.460 --> 01:05:07.000]   You do it again, I'll kill you.
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:12.620]   How many times do we think that we've exhausted his patience
[01:05:12.620 --> 01:05:16.820]   that we are forgiven but just barely?
[01:05:16.820 --> 01:05:18.060]   You know, just barely.
[01:05:18.060 --> 01:05:21.220]   You know, there's some, you know,
[01:05:21.220 --> 01:05:23.560]   like lovable, cute people.
[01:05:23.560 --> 01:05:25.420]   They embrace, they sit on his lap and say,
[01:05:25.420 --> 01:05:28.220]   oh, you know, heavenly father, we love you.
[01:05:28.220 --> 01:05:32.640]   There's a lot of us who think that our pardon was reluctant.
[01:05:32.640 --> 01:05:36.820]   He begrudgingly pardoned us.
[01:05:36.820 --> 01:05:38.420]   That's not what he says.
[01:05:38.420 --> 01:05:41.220]   He says not only did he make the way to salvation
[01:05:41.220 --> 01:05:46.220]   abundantly clear, he said that his pardon was abundant.
[01:05:46.220 --> 01:05:51.300]   And that's why the Bible describes when a sinner repents,
[01:05:51.300 --> 01:05:52.200]   what happens?
[01:05:53.340 --> 01:05:55.180]   Heavens celebrate.
[01:05:55.180 --> 01:05:59.860]   That's why he gave the picture in Luke chapter 15.
[01:05:59.860 --> 01:06:02.620]   He said when a sheep goes astray, he's like,
[01:06:02.620 --> 01:06:04.280]   oh my gosh, he went astray again.
[01:06:04.280 --> 01:06:08.260]   He says he left them behind, he went after him.
[01:06:08.260 --> 01:06:09.580]   And what was his point?
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:13.960]   Every sinner, every one of those sheep matters to him.
[01:06:13.960 --> 01:06:16.100]   And then when he comes back, what happens?
[01:06:16.100 --> 01:06:18.420]   They celebrate, they have a huge party.
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:21.440]   And then they have the lost coin.
[01:06:21.440 --> 01:06:23.660]   He sweeps the whole house.
[01:06:23.660 --> 01:06:25.020]   It's like, ah, it's just a little coin.
[01:06:25.020 --> 01:06:27.020]   I have all this other, I'm a rich person.
[01:06:27.020 --> 01:06:28.940]   He said, no, that one coin is precious.
[01:06:28.940 --> 01:06:29.860]   And he sweeps the whole house.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:31.420]   And then when they find the coin,
[01:06:31.420 --> 01:06:32.940]   they have a huge celebration.
[01:06:32.940 --> 01:06:36.300]   Those of us who are anals will look at that and say,
[01:06:36.300 --> 01:06:38.340]   well, that kind of defeats the purpose of finding the coin
[01:06:38.340 --> 01:06:41.100]   if you spend all of that to celebrate finding the coin.
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:42.500]   But that was not the point.
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:44.240]   Don't get sidetracked.
[01:06:44.240 --> 01:06:47.820]   The point is that it was precious.
[01:06:47.820 --> 01:06:51.040]   And he was willing to sweep the house.
[01:06:51.540 --> 01:06:55.620]   And he was overjoyed when he found it.
[01:06:55.620 --> 01:06:57.740]   And all of that leads to the prodigal son.
[01:06:57.740 --> 01:06:59.980]   When the son leaves and he comes back,
[01:06:59.980 --> 01:07:05.060]   his father didn't say, okay, you screwed up.
[01:07:05.060 --> 01:07:06.700]   He said, you want to be one of my servants?
[01:07:06.700 --> 01:07:09.420]   Okay, even that, you're going to have to earn that.
[01:07:09.420 --> 01:07:10.980]   Go live with the pigs for a while.
[01:07:10.980 --> 01:07:13.300]   And if you do good for the next two years,
[01:07:13.300 --> 01:07:15.000]   we'll consider.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:16.160]   That's not what he says.
[01:07:16.160 --> 01:07:19.680]   The parable that Jesus gave was the father
[01:07:19.680 --> 01:07:22.140]   was eagerly waiting for him to return.
[01:07:22.140 --> 01:07:25.940]   And when he came back, even before he said, I'm sorry,
[01:07:25.940 --> 01:07:29.220]   he knew, he knew the humble position that he was in.
[01:07:29.220 --> 01:07:31.260]   The father runs out, puts a cloak on,
[01:07:31.260 --> 01:07:33.800]   puts a cipolla on him, brings him back home and says,
[01:07:33.800 --> 01:07:36.500]   we're going to have the biggest party we've ever had.
[01:07:36.500 --> 01:07:42.340]   So when he says he will lead us to green pastures,
[01:07:42.340 --> 01:07:45.820]   that we may have life, not just life,
[01:07:45.820 --> 01:07:49.660]   not just not die, but have abundant life.
[01:07:49.660 --> 01:07:52.940]   We are abundantly pardoned.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:57.640]   Exodus 34, six, then the Lord passed by in front of him
[01:07:57.640 --> 01:07:59.240]   and proclaimed, the Lord, the Lord God,
[01:07:59.240 --> 01:08:01.400]   compassionate and gracious, slow to anger,
[01:08:01.400 --> 01:08:05.320]   abounding in loving kindness and truth.
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:09.520]   You and I, no matter where we are in our walk with God,
[01:08:09.520 --> 01:08:12.860]   maybe even this week, we failed.
[01:08:14.200 --> 01:08:16.140]   Maybe even this week, as we are worshiping God,
[01:08:16.140 --> 01:08:19.400]   sitting wherever we are, we may be thinking,
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:20.900]   I better do better this week.
[01:08:20.900 --> 01:08:25.180]   And maybe we should, you know, we should try harder.
[01:08:25.180 --> 01:08:30.380]   But in the end, in the end, the Bible says,
[01:08:30.380 --> 01:08:34.500]   we are where we are because he is abounding in compassion.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:39.360]   He didn't bring us into his kingdom reluctantly.
[01:08:39.360 --> 01:08:41.120]   He didn't turn the other way and say, you know what,
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.400]   that one, I'll let him squeeze in.
[01:08:43.400 --> 01:08:45.340]   Every single one of us with the lost sheep,
[01:08:45.340 --> 01:08:48.080]   the lost coin and the prodigal son,
[01:08:48.080 --> 01:08:51.960]   and God called us out by name.
[01:08:51.960 --> 01:08:54.940]   And that's why you and I are here.
[01:08:54.940 --> 01:08:58.000]   Psalm 36, seven through nine,
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:08:59.960]   how precious is your loving kindness, O God,
[01:08:59.960 --> 01:09:01.960]   and the children of men take refuge
[01:09:01.960 --> 01:09:04.080]   in the shadow of your wings.
[01:09:04.080 --> 01:09:07.360]   They drink their fill of abundance of your house
[01:09:07.360 --> 01:09:11.160]   for with you, and you give them to drink
[01:09:11.160 --> 01:09:14.120]   the river of your delight.
[01:09:14.120 --> 01:09:16.020]   For with you is the fountain of life,
[01:09:16.020 --> 01:09:18.400]   and in your light, we see light.
[01:09:18.400 --> 01:09:20.360]   You see how the description of our salvation,
[01:09:20.360 --> 01:09:23.240]   of our life, is not just you will not die.
[01:09:23.240 --> 01:09:25.720]   It's abundance in your house,
[01:09:25.720 --> 01:09:28.320]   river that's filled with delight, fountain of light.
[01:09:28.320 --> 01:09:30.720]   That's what he means.
[01:09:30.720 --> 01:09:34.480]   When he saved us, he saved us so that you and I
[01:09:34.480 --> 01:09:36.760]   can have life and have this life abundant.
[01:09:36.760 --> 01:09:38.640]   That's why one of the greatest evidence
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.920]   of somebody who has encountered Christ is joy, life.
[01:09:42.920 --> 01:09:48.400]   I mean, you ever see somebody who accept,
[01:09:48.400 --> 01:09:50.200]   genuinely accept Christ?
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.920]   Some of you may have been recent,
[01:09:52.920 --> 01:09:54.080]   maybe it's been a while,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.960]   maybe you were on a mission field sometime,
[01:09:55.960 --> 01:09:58.360]   but you ever meet somebody who met Christ,
[01:09:58.360 --> 01:10:01.240]   like just immediately met Christ?
[01:10:01.240 --> 01:10:03.640]   You ever meet somebody who met Christ
[01:10:03.640 --> 01:10:06.000]   and they're kind of like, oh, I'm so depressed.
[01:10:07.720 --> 01:10:08.840]   I don't know, maybe you met somebody,
[01:10:08.840 --> 01:10:11.480]   but I've never met anybody who just met Christ
[01:10:11.480 --> 01:10:13.980]   and their immediate reaction is depression.
[01:10:13.980 --> 01:10:21.480]   You know, part of the reason why so many are discontent
[01:10:21.480 --> 01:10:24.700]   is because they have strayed from the well of Christ.
[01:10:24.700 --> 01:10:29.040]   They're not drinking from the river of life.
[01:10:29.040 --> 01:10:31.800]   Maybe at one point you experienced it,
[01:10:31.800 --> 01:10:33.640]   but you drifted from that.
[01:10:33.640 --> 01:10:36.280]   They're not eating from the bread of life.
[01:10:36.280 --> 01:10:39.800]   They're not being guided by the father of light.
[01:10:39.800 --> 01:10:45.340]   They're not running toward Christ as life and resurrection.
[01:10:45.340 --> 01:10:49.240]   That we want certain doors to open,
[01:10:49.240 --> 01:10:52.560]   that may lead us to more heartache.
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:58.000]   We're looking to shepherds that's going to guide us,
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.800]   that ultimately is going to hurt us.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:03.000]   Let me finish with this,
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.820]   this favorite Psalm of so many people, Psalm 23.
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:10.140]   Because this relationship basically summarizes
[01:11:10.140 --> 01:11:11.620]   our relationship with Christ.
[01:11:11.620 --> 01:11:16.700]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:21.700]   Meaning, I am content with Christ, I have enough in Christ.
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:23.980]   The Lord is my shepherd.
[01:11:23.980 --> 01:11:26.300]   There are no other doors, there's no other water,
[01:11:26.300 --> 01:11:28.860]   there's no other bread, there's no other light,
[01:11:28.860 --> 01:11:30.820]   there's no other gate, there's no other shepherd
[01:11:30.820 --> 01:11:31.660]   that I'm looking for.
[01:11:31.660 --> 01:11:35.000]   The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:11:35.920 --> 01:11:39.200]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[01:11:39.200 --> 01:11:43.840]   Not the leaders, not my education, not my business,
[01:11:43.840 --> 01:11:45.820]   not opportunities, not my friends,
[01:11:45.820 --> 01:11:48.760]   and sometimes maybe not even our church.
[01:11:48.760 --> 01:11:53.980]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[01:11:53.980 --> 01:11:56.800]   He leads me besides quiet waters.
[01:11:56.800 --> 01:11:59.740]   Maybe some of us are in turmoil.
[01:11:59.740 --> 01:12:03.080]   Now I know some people are getting furloughed,
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:03.920]   there's some anxiety,
[01:12:03.920 --> 01:12:05.800]   especially the healthcare workers going into work,
[01:12:05.800 --> 01:12:08.680]   there's anxiousness of possibly you're being exposed
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.560]   and you're gonna get it and bring it home.
[01:12:10.560 --> 01:12:13.900]   There's a lot of anxiousness, but where do you find peace?
[01:12:13.900 --> 01:12:17.720]   So He restores my soul.
[01:12:17.720 --> 01:12:20.280]   He's the one where I find peace.
[01:12:20.280 --> 01:12:23.040]   He's the one who leads me to green pastures.
[01:12:23.040 --> 01:12:25.520]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness
[01:12:25.520 --> 01:12:28.140]   for His name's sake.
[01:12:28.140 --> 01:12:31.200]   Even though I walk through the valley
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:32.800]   of the shadow of death.
[01:12:32.800 --> 01:12:34.640]   You know what shadow of death means?
[01:12:34.640 --> 01:12:39.640]   When you see the shadow, it means the reality is coming.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.700]   So in other words, it's close.
[01:12:41.700 --> 01:12:45.860]   And again, I think, at least in my lifetime,
[01:12:45.860 --> 01:12:48.440]   where the whole world was locked down
[01:12:48.440 --> 01:12:50.080]   because of fear of death.
[01:12:50.080 --> 01:12:54.120]   I mean, a good way to put that is a shadow of death.
[01:12:54.120 --> 01:12:57.280]   I think the reality of death has caused all of us
[01:12:57.280 --> 01:12:58.620]   to be more sober.
[01:12:58.620 --> 01:13:01.720]   Whether that happens or doesn't happen
[01:13:01.720 --> 01:13:05.900]   during this period, we know for a fact that it is coming.
[01:13:05.900 --> 01:13:09.800]   The shadow of death lingers over mankind.
[01:13:09.800 --> 01:13:11.160]   That's what the Bible says.
[01:13:11.160 --> 01:13:14.240]   That because of the sin of mankind,
[01:13:14.240 --> 01:13:20.480]   the bondage and the fear of death has gripped the whole world
[01:13:20.480 --> 01:13:22.000]   but He says, though I walk through the valley
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.040]   of the shadow of death, I fear no evil.
[01:13:24.040 --> 01:13:27.020]   You notice how He said He doesn't fear death.
[01:13:27.020 --> 01:13:27.940]   He doesn't fear hardship.
[01:13:27.940 --> 01:13:29.000]   He doesn't fear suffering.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.880]   He says, no, I fear no evil.
[01:13:31.720 --> 01:13:36.160]   Because even as sheep, at times, will go through suffering,
[01:13:36.160 --> 01:13:37.880]   we're gonna have to go through the valleys,
[01:13:37.880 --> 01:13:42.560]   dryness, wolves, and ultimately we will all die physically.
[01:13:42.560 --> 01:13:45.640]   But here He says, I fear no evil.
[01:13:45.640 --> 01:13:48.560]   You know, the sting of death is sin.
[01:13:48.560 --> 01:13:50.680]   So in other words, He says, because He's taken away
[01:13:50.680 --> 01:13:52.720]   the sting of death, I fear no evil.
[01:13:52.720 --> 01:13:55.720]   That even in death, my shepherd guides me
[01:13:55.720 --> 01:13:58.160]   for you are with me.
[01:13:59.000 --> 01:14:01.640]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[01:14:01.640 --> 01:14:04.760]   The reason why the shepherd holds the staff
[01:14:04.760 --> 01:14:08.280]   is to fight off the wolves who come to.
[01:14:08.280 --> 01:14:11.980]   So it was a source of a weapon.
[01:14:11.980 --> 01:14:15.840]   But He said, when He sees His strength, His rod,
[01:14:15.840 --> 01:14:18.780]   they comfort me because that rod is to protect them.
[01:14:18.780 --> 01:14:21.900]   His judgment, His righteousness,
[01:14:21.900 --> 01:14:24.000]   even at times, discipline in the church,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.840]   He said it comforts them because it's for their own good.
[01:14:27.840 --> 01:14:30.120]   You prepare a table before me
[01:14:30.120 --> 01:14:31.600]   in the presence of my enemies.
[01:14:31.600 --> 01:14:34.040]   I do not need to fear those who want to hurt me
[01:14:34.040 --> 01:14:36.120]   because my shepherd is with me.
[01:14:36.120 --> 01:14:38.000]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:42.640]   In other words, I have been set apart for His service.
[01:14:42.640 --> 01:14:45.480]   And so my cup overflows.
[01:14:45.480 --> 01:14:50.160]   I pray that as we meditate and think about Christ
[01:14:50.160 --> 01:14:52.540]   as our door and Him as our shepherd,
[01:14:52.540 --> 01:14:57.060]   and we ask ourselves, is my cup truly overflowing?
[01:14:58.060 --> 01:15:00.380]   Do I catch myself day to day overflowing
[01:15:00.380 --> 01:15:02.860]   in gratitude for what I have?
[01:15:02.860 --> 01:15:05.700]   Or am I constantly thinking that only if I had this,
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.260]   only if I had that, only if I could get out,
[01:15:08.260 --> 01:15:12.140]   only if I can get a promotion, is my cup overflowing?
[01:15:12.140 --> 01:15:14.420]   Are we experiencing this abundant life?
[01:15:14.420 --> 01:15:18.620]   And I think, again, with all the horrible things
[01:15:18.620 --> 01:15:20.780]   that may be going on around the world,
[01:15:20.780 --> 01:15:24.200]   that this time is God ordained for us
[01:15:24.200 --> 01:15:26.980]   to maybe take a step back, to refocus our attention
[01:15:26.980 --> 01:15:30.380]   on our shepherd and ask ourselves,
[01:15:30.380 --> 01:15:33.540]   am I going to the green pastures that He is leading me to?
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:37.660]   Or have I been drifting somewhere else?
[01:15:37.660 --> 01:15:40.300]   And let me leave you with this.
[01:15:40.300 --> 01:15:41.620]   And I've shared this so many times,
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:43.900]   I think some of you may have memorized it.
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:48.920]   When I was younger, my parents had this little clock
[01:15:48.920 --> 01:15:53.460]   in our living room, and on it had a little proverb,
[01:15:53.460 --> 01:15:56.460]   not from the Bible, I think it was given to them as a gift,
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:00.220]   and on that it said, "Happiness is wanting what you have
[01:16:00.220 --> 01:16:02.520]   "and not having what you want."
[01:16:02.520 --> 01:16:03.540]   Let me say that again.
[01:16:03.540 --> 01:16:05.380]   "Happiness is wanting what you have
[01:16:05.380 --> 01:16:08.300]   "and not having what you want."
[01:16:08.300 --> 01:16:12.000]   And I remember so many days sitting on my couch,
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.980]   angry about something, discontent about something.
[01:16:15.980 --> 01:16:17.540]   Maybe I got in a fight with my brothers,
[01:16:17.540 --> 01:16:19.940]   or my mom punished me for something,
[01:16:19.940 --> 01:16:21.500]   and I'm just sitting there pouting,
[01:16:21.500 --> 01:16:24.180]   and I'm looking at this clock, and I would just,
[01:16:24.180 --> 01:16:26.700]   happiness is having what you want,
[01:16:26.700 --> 01:16:29.240]   not wanting what you have.
[01:16:29.240 --> 01:16:32.860]   Now, it got embedded into my psyche,
[01:16:32.860 --> 01:16:34.020]   not because I understood it,
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:35.700]   not because I was applying it,
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:37.180]   but because it was just right there,
[01:16:37.180 --> 01:16:38.880]   it was on the wall for years.
[01:16:38.880 --> 01:16:41.660]   Looking back at it now,
[01:16:41.660 --> 01:16:46.620]   and I think so much about where my discontent comes from.
[01:16:46.620 --> 01:16:51.100]   So much of my discontent comes from wanting
[01:16:52.560 --> 01:16:55.040]   to think that if I have what I want,
[01:16:55.040 --> 01:16:57.480]   that that's when I'm going to have abundant life.
[01:16:57.480 --> 01:17:00.560]   But the salvation that he gave us,
[01:17:00.560 --> 01:17:03.400]   every sheep of his already has.
[01:17:03.400 --> 01:17:05.080]   And when we recognize the value
[01:17:05.080 --> 01:17:07.540]   of what God has already given us,
[01:17:07.540 --> 01:17:09.080]   that's when we find life.
[01:17:09.080 --> 01:17:11.740]   That's when we find life abundantly.
[01:17:11.740 --> 01:17:14.360]   So I pray that, again,
[01:17:14.360 --> 01:17:17.000]   there's all the distractions and everything else that,
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:18.800]   again, not that you're not distracted,
[01:17:18.800 --> 01:17:21.440]   there's a lot of stuff to distract us even at home,
[01:17:21.440 --> 01:17:23.660]   but in the midst of this pandemic,
[01:17:23.660 --> 01:17:28.280]   and when our normal life is not happening right now,
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.240]   that it'd be an opportunity for us to focus.
[01:17:31.240 --> 01:17:33.160]   What is it that I should be rejoicing in
[01:17:33.160 --> 01:17:34.720]   that I've kind of drifted from?
[01:17:34.720 --> 01:17:38.040]   And learn to restore that abundant life
[01:17:38.040 --> 01:17:40.220]   that God intended for us.
[01:17:40.220 --> 01:17:41.060]   Let's pray.
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:47.740]   Heavenly Father, we pray that as you promised us,
[01:17:49.320 --> 01:17:53.240]   that you and your son, Christ, Lord God,
[01:17:53.240 --> 01:17:54.760]   would lead us to green pastures,
[01:17:54.760 --> 01:17:56.720]   that you would give us peace,
[01:17:56.720 --> 01:17:58.920]   that we would have this abundant life,
[01:17:58.920 --> 01:18:01.720]   that if we drink of the well and the water that Christ gives
[01:18:01.720 --> 01:18:04.160]   that it will spring up in us eternal life,
[01:18:04.160 --> 01:18:06.320]   that we would never thirst again,
[01:18:06.320 --> 01:18:09.420]   that if we eat of the bread that our shepherd gives us,
[01:18:09.420 --> 01:18:12.420]   that we would never hunger again.
[01:18:12.420 --> 01:18:14.960]   I pray, Father God,
[01:18:14.960 --> 01:18:19.140]   that we would be people characterized by this joy.
[01:18:20.140 --> 01:18:22.100]   And this joy and peace, Lord God,
[01:18:22.100 --> 01:18:25.100]   not the world can give, but only Christ.
[01:18:25.100 --> 01:18:27.420]   And so as we meditate and think this week
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:30.640]   about Christ being our door, Christ being our shepherd,
[01:18:30.640 --> 01:18:33.780]   may this life be restored and refreshed in us.
[01:18:33.780 --> 01:18:35.620]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:22:55.560 --> 01:23:01.080]   Gracious and loving Father,
[01:23:01.080 --> 01:23:03.920]   we continue to pray, Lord God, for our church,
[01:23:03.920 --> 01:23:08.920]   for all of us, Lord, that you would help us to stay sober.
[01:23:08.920 --> 01:23:11.640]   And I know that even at home we are distracted.
[01:23:12.600 --> 01:23:15.640]   Help us, Lord God, to use our time wisely.
[01:23:15.640 --> 01:23:17.760]   And it would cause us to hunger and thirst
[01:23:17.760 --> 01:23:19.880]   for righteousness even more than
[01:23:19.880 --> 01:23:21.520]   when we first entered into this.
[01:23:21.520 --> 01:23:24.440]   We pray for those who are working
[01:23:24.440 --> 01:23:26.300]   and they are interacting with other people,
[01:23:26.300 --> 01:23:28.360]   that you would keep them safe.
[01:23:28.360 --> 01:23:31.320]   But even beyond that, Lord, help them to be a good witness.
[01:23:31.320 --> 01:23:36.280]   That our treasure and our desire, our hope,
[01:23:36.280 --> 01:23:39.560]   and our joy in life is found in Christ.
[01:23:39.560 --> 01:23:42.760]   And that as people are staggering
[01:23:42.760 --> 01:23:44.440]   and searching for truth, Lord God,
[01:23:44.440 --> 01:23:46.720]   that we would keep our eyes open
[01:23:46.720 --> 01:23:49.960]   to see how we may be able to be a light.
[01:23:49.960 --> 01:23:51.600]   And so we pray for your grace.
[01:23:51.600 --> 01:23:55.520]   We pray for the shining of the gospel in this dark world,
[01:23:55.520 --> 01:23:58.480]   that more and more, thousands, hundreds of thousands,
[01:23:58.480 --> 01:24:02.760]   millions of people may come to Christ as a result of this.
[01:24:02.760 --> 01:24:05.960]   And so we pray, Father God, that your name may be glorified,
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:08.840]   that we would experience a greater revival,
[01:24:08.840 --> 01:24:10.600]   and that our love and confession for you
[01:24:10.600 --> 01:24:12.900]   would be deeper and sweeter than it ever was.
[01:24:12.900 --> 01:24:15.880]   So now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:24:15.880 --> 01:24:17.880]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:24:17.880 --> 01:24:19.720]   and eternal love of God the Father,
[01:24:19.720 --> 01:24:22.760]   rest, restore, and strengthen every soul
[01:24:22.760 --> 01:24:25.680]   that desires to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[01:24:25.680 --> 01:24:26.520]   Amen.
