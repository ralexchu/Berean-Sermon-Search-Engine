[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   chapter 1 and I'm going to be reading verse from 1 through 7 this morning.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:14.240]   Philemon chapter 1, actually it's only one chapter, Philemon 1 through 7.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.760]   Okay.
[00:00:16.760 --> 00:00:23.840]   Philemon 1 through 7, "Paul prisoner for Christ Jesus and Timothy our brother to
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.400]   Philemon our beloved fellow worker and Aphia our sister and Archippus our
[00:00:28.400 --> 00:00:32.360]   fellow soldier in the church in your house. Grace to you and peace from God
[00:00:32.360 --> 00:00:36.500]   our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ. I thank my God always when I remember you
[00:00:36.500 --> 00:00:39.720]   in my prayers because I hear of your love and of the faith that you have
[00:00:39.720 --> 00:00:43.920]   toward the Lord Jesus and for all the saints. And I pray that the sharing of
[00:00:43.920 --> 00:00:47.600]   your faith may become effective for the full knowledge of every good thing that
[00:00:47.600 --> 00:00:51.840]   is in us for the sake of Christ. For I have derived much joy and comfort from
[00:00:51.840 --> 00:00:55.360]   your love my brother because the hearts of the saints have been refreshed
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.080]   through you." Let's pray.
[00:00:59.080 --> 00:01:05.760]   Gracious and loving Father we thank you so much for this morning. We thank you
[00:01:05.760 --> 00:01:11.480]   for your provisions. We thank you for health. We thank you Lord God the freedom
[00:01:11.480 --> 00:01:16.080]   that we have to worship you in this country. And we ask Lord that you would
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:19.160]   help us never to take any of these things for granted and we know that
[00:01:19.160 --> 00:01:22.800]   there are brothers and sisters all around the world who are being
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:27.320]   persecuted and it's such a privilege Lord God for them to even gather
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:34.400]   together. So we pray Father that as we wrestle not against flesh and blood that
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.360]   you would equip us, challenge us, renew us, and fill us with your spirit Lord God
[00:01:39.360 --> 00:01:44.760]   that your power may be evident in your church. So we pray for your grace for the
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.560]   rest of this time in Jesus name we pray amen. All right so we're gonna be in the
[00:01:50.560 --> 00:01:54.640]   book of or the letter of Philemon for the next maybe about a month or so and
[00:01:54.640 --> 00:01:59.240]   I am I've been kind of wrestling with where to jump to after second Timothy
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:06.480]   and I am for the most part committed to the book of Romans for the most part and
[00:02:06.480 --> 00:02:11.120]   we've studied the book of Romans several times in different avenues and that was
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:14.080]   kind of like the book that we spent I think the first two three years of Bible
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:17.400]   study on Friday night. So there's a few of you who was with us during that
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:22.600]   period and I really was wrestling should I jump to the Old Testament should I go
[00:02:22.600 --> 00:02:27.240]   through another book and and I before I jump to the Romans I wanted to spend
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:31.800]   some time in Philemon because it is a short letter and I the subject matter
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:35.520]   that we're gonna be talking about I think is will be beneficial for us and
[00:02:35.520 --> 00:02:38.200]   then once we get to Romans we're gonna be in there for a while but I really
[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:42.960]   want to wrestle through the text and and see what we have how it's gonna affect
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:48.160]   our church as we go through it but Philemon on the surface may look like
[00:02:48.160 --> 00:02:51.720]   you know if you if you've ever read Philemon you may end at the end of it
[00:02:51.720 --> 00:02:56.000]   ask yourself why is this even in the Bible you know because there's no major
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.560]   doctrines exposited in this text there's not it's not an instruction for pastoral
[00:03:00.560 --> 00:03:06.880]   ministry it's there's no advice about how to run the church or you know any
[00:03:06.880 --> 00:03:11.400]   any of this stuff so we may just kind of read it and then say well okay it's a
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:14.600]   very personal letter it's almost like right reading a letter that was written
[00:03:14.600 --> 00:03:18.840]   from one person to another person just kind of a third person reading it but I
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:24.480]   really believe that Philemon is is a powerful letter because it gives us a
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:30.720]   glimpse of the early church we know a lot of issues and problems that the
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:34.320]   early church had and obviously Paul and the other Apostles were writing to
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:40.160]   address these issues but really this letter gives us the life of what at
[00:03:40.160 --> 00:03:43.760]   least one aspect of the life of the early church and you know I know that
[00:03:43.760 --> 00:03:47.720]   in the last maybe about five six years there's been a movement that kind of you
[00:03:47.720 --> 00:03:51.040]   know went across on it and I think we're still in the midst of it this gospel
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:53.880]   centered movement some of you guys may be aware of it some of you may not be
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:58.040]   but this gospel centered movement if you go to the bookstore almost every book
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:04:01.760]   new books is coming out is gospel centered parenting gospel centered
[00:04:01.760 --> 00:04:05.800]   church gospel centered prayer gospel centered marriage I mean everything is
[00:04:05.800 --> 00:04:11.440]   just gospel centered and I think core of it is fantastic because gospel ought to
[00:04:11.440 --> 00:04:16.320]   be the foundation gospel should be the reason why we worship and gospel should
[00:04:16.320 --> 00:04:22.960]   be the cornerstone in which we build any church but if we're not careful the
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:27.440]   gospel center movement can easily become just vocabulary now instead of saying
[00:04:27.440 --> 00:04:31.800]   Christ centered we say gospel centered instead of saying loving God we say we
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:36.160]   love the gospel right instead of saying we've been impacted by the cross we say
[00:04:36.160 --> 00:04:41.800]   impacted by the gospel so if we're not careful all it will become is just the
[00:04:41.800 --> 00:04:45.640]   way we express our faith is different well you know he says it the right way
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:52.320]   or he uses the right vocabulary if it is truly gospel centered it must be
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:57.240]   evident in the life of the people not just vocabulary not just how you feel in
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:02.280]   a room but the power not when Paul says I am NOT ashamed of gospel for it is the
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:08.600]   power of God unto salvation how has the gospel shaped your life does it brought
[00:05:08.600 --> 00:05:14.280]   you to your knees how has the gospel shaped your evangelism have you been
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:21.240]   more convicted or is it just a security blanket see the power of the gospel
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.160]   power of the cross I think the greatest evidence of that is in a changed life
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:32.200]   the Apostle Paul here's a man riding to a predominantly Gentile city the Colossae
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:38.000]   which is where our the recipient of this letter is from Philemon and here's a man
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:42.360]   who at one point hated the Gentile he was probably one of those people that
[00:05:42.360 --> 00:05:46.760]   would travel an extra day just to get around Samaritan Samaria because he
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.920]   thought that that land was tainted he was a Pharisee among Pharisees and here
[00:05:51.920 --> 00:05:56.480]   now he's sitting in prison and he's writing to a group of probably most
[00:05:56.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   likely a Gentile Church trying to restore this runaway slave to his former
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:08.000]   master see that the early church I think the greatest evidence to me of the
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.020]   resurrection of Jesus Christ is the impact that it made not on the
[00:06:13.020 --> 00:06:19.480]   individual but on the culture of the early church imagine Jews and Gentiles
[00:06:19.480 --> 00:06:23.560]   hated each other for hundreds maybe thousands of years they hated each other
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:28.640]   and all of a sudden you find them calling each other thousands of them
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:35.000]   brothers and sisters in the same church you see people who are former Pharisees
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:39.960]   sitting with former tax collectors and the tax collectors are instructing them
[00:06:39.960 --> 00:06:44.400]   about how to be right with God like what happened and it didn't happen in in a
[00:06:44.400 --> 00:06:48.400]   matter of three four five hundred years instantaneously these people were saying
[00:06:48.400 --> 00:06:54.520]   because Christ was resurrected that it changed them that powerfully a former
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.440]   slave and a runaway slave and former slave owner would be brothers and
[00:07:01.440 --> 00:07:06.160]   sisters in the church sharing and breaking bread together clearly
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.960]   something powerful happened this was not you know no matter how much you try to
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.640]   psychoanalyze this and say you know sociologically maybe because the poor
[00:07:14.640 --> 00:07:18.080]   were attracted to the gospel because of the promises that it made I mean no
[00:07:18.080 --> 00:07:24.080]   matter how much you try to dissect why the Christianity took off no amount of
[00:07:24.080 --> 00:07:28.240]   analyzing and dissecting really will explain this powerful change that took
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:35.080]   place all like instantaneously other than the cross itself you know a few
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:38.720]   years ago I was contacted by a friend of mine that I haven't seen since high
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:41.880]   school so it's you know on the first service I was in the calculation it was
[00:07:41.880 --> 00:07:46.520]   about almost 29 years I haven't I haven't seen him and so I got in contact
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.000]   he somehow found me through a mutual friend and he wanted to become a my
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.560]   Facebook buddy so I said man I haven't seen this guy in years so we finally got
[00:07:54.560 --> 00:07:59.240]   together and you have to you have to realize that the last time I saw this
[00:07:59.240 --> 00:08:03.600]   guy he got kicked out of Kennedy High School I think it's in Artesia for
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:09.520]   selling drugs and so obviously I had friends who were you know running in
[00:08:09.520 --> 00:08:13.600]   that same kind of crowd and so we met each other and the last time I remember
[00:08:13.600 --> 00:08:18.320]   him was getting drunk with with beer and whatever alcohol in the back of his
[00:08:18.320 --> 00:08:22.320]   trunk in some parking lot and I forgot why we drifted apart but that's the last
[00:08:22.320 --> 00:08:26.680]   memory I have of him and he has of me and so when we met together I was
[00:08:26.680 --> 00:08:32.120]   thinking like man I'm a pastor now you know and I was kind of curious what our
[00:08:32.120 --> 00:08:35.840]   conversation was gonna be like you know he's probably gonna say remember when we
[00:08:35.840 --> 00:08:41.240]   did this and we did that so I'm a pastor now you know I don't do that you know
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:47.120]   but we finally met together and found out that he had a huge conversion
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:53.320]   experience he actually had double cancer and he was beating that he just kind of
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:59.680]   came out of chemotherapy and and even prior to that how God radically changed
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:04.000]   him and he's a deacon at the church down the street here Bethel he's a he's a
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.760]   fop so he's in the Korean side right and so he was sharing with me about his
[00:09:08.760 --> 00:09:13.080]   testimony and about how he came to know the Lord and he goes to morning prayer
[00:09:13.080 --> 00:09:16.480]   every single day he's involved with the mission program there he's always you
[00:09:16.480 --> 00:09:20.320]   know flying over to Turkey and to Hong Kong and to China and to Korea and and
[00:09:20.320 --> 00:09:26.800]   to to help with the missions program and his life goal right now is to is to be
[00:09:26.800 --> 00:09:30.440]   able to support missionaries after they retire so that they can come home and
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:33.840]   retire and to take care of them because he realized so many missionaries have a
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.560]   hard time when they retire and he's a very successful businessman so so you
[00:09:39.560 --> 00:09:43.200]   know he actually has the means to be able to do that so you know I'm blown
[00:09:43.200 --> 00:09:48.360]   away because last time I remember him was again just getting drunk and then he
[00:09:48.360 --> 00:09:51.520]   would tell me a story he's like hey so what's going on with you so I'm a church
[00:09:51.520 --> 00:09:55.320]   down here in the street you know over here and he actually came visit a couple
[00:09:55.320 --> 00:10:00.000]   years ago and so every once in a while we still meet up and we have
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:03.760]   time of fellowship and every time I talk with him it's just I'm just blown away
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:08.280]   you know in the last 20 some years that I haven't seen this guy like what this
[00:10:08.280 --> 00:10:12.480]   guy became so every once in a while I get tempted to bring that bring up our
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.560]   old past but it's just kind of awkward now you know what I mean because he's
[00:10:16.560 --> 00:10:22.200]   we're talking about missions and all of a sudden a minute you got drunk you know
[00:10:22.200 --> 00:10:27.400]   I mean I think the power of the testimony of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:32.000]   has changed lives no matter how much we say you know this is what the gospel is
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.440]   this is what Jesus is and we share all of that if there isn't the testimony of
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:42.880]   how it affected our lives it becomes impotent it's powerless the true core of
[00:10:42.880 --> 00:10:47.600]   the gospel movement has to change the church it has to change our prayer life
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:51.920]   it has to change our fellowship it has to change the way we live what we pursue
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:58.760]   what we value it can't be just change of vocabulary see in the early church not
[00:10:58.760 --> 00:11:02.560]   only is do you see the effects of the gospel in an individual's life but you
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:07.880]   see it immediately in the book of Acts you know a positive Paul alpha so Peter
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:12.680]   preaches the gospel in front of the same people who crucified Jesus most likely
[00:11:12.680 --> 00:11:17.960]   at the end of it 3,000 people come to Christ and then right after that it
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.760]   describes what this community looked like in the early church now I want you
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:25.920]   to I want you to follow along with me you don't need to turn there but I want
[00:11:25.920 --> 00:11:32.760]   you to listen to how it's described they were asked to 42 to 47 they devoted
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:36.840]   themselves to the Apostles teaching and fellowship to the breaking of bread and
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:42.720]   the prayer and all came upon every soul and many wonders and signs were being
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:46.800]   done through the Apostles and all who believe were together and had all things
[00:11:46.800 --> 00:11:50.200]   in common and they were selling their possessions and belongings and
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:55.440]   distributing the proceeds to all as any had need and day by day attending the
[00:11:55.440 --> 00:11:58.880]   temple together and breaking bread in their homes they received their food
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:03.600]   with glad and generous hearts praising God and having favor with all the people
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:08.720]   and the Lord added to their number day by day those who are being saved now I
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:12.360]   know you probably read this before and you look at this is like oh I mean you
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:18.080]   know this is nothing new do you know how much discipleship and work and labor
[00:12:18.080 --> 00:12:24.000]   would go into building a community that looks like this I can imagine like a
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.040]   church of maybe a hundred and twenty all of a sudden have three thousand people
[00:12:29.040 --> 00:12:34.640]   being baptized and part of that church like just just organizing like how are
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:39.280]   we gonna eat on Sunday you know I remember when our church was smaller and
[00:12:39.280 --> 00:12:43.680]   we had about a hundred people every Sunday you know we had lunch and we'd be
[00:12:43.680 --> 00:12:46.360]   together and after a while we realized like oh that's too much work let's go
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:50.400]   out and then we would go to you know some fast food joint and we would shut
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:54.800]   that down and then you know the UTC where the college students hang out we
[00:12:54.800 --> 00:12:58.680]   used to actually go there on Sundays and shut that whole place down you know then
[00:12:58.680 --> 00:13:01.440]   we grew a little bit after that it's like well we can't do that anymore so
[00:13:01.440 --> 00:13:05.240]   we'll do lunch at the church again but let's do it every other week and then
[00:13:05.240 --> 00:13:09.280]   every week every month and then now it's like man even once a month is it's too
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:13.040]   much of a headache right how we're gonna do Bible study we used to fit everybody
[00:13:13.040 --> 00:13:16.920]   in my house and then when that overflowed we had Wednesday and Friday
[00:13:16.920 --> 00:13:21.680]   and then we have to offer I mean it just I can't imagine a church going from 120
[00:13:21.680 --> 00:13:27.200]   to 3,000 overnight in my mind it's like oh my gosh I mean that's just too much
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:30.160]   we're not gonna find enough leaders we're not gonna be able to disciple
[00:13:30.160 --> 00:13:36.720]   people fast enough but yet we have a community here instantaneously was
[00:13:36.720 --> 00:13:41.200]   devoted to the teaching breaking of bread fellowship they were actually very
[00:13:41.200 --> 00:13:45.960]   generous selling their possession giving it to one another they were enjoying the
[00:13:45.960 --> 00:13:50.560]   favor when I mean this is an ideal perfect church but it happened
[00:13:50.560 --> 00:13:56.160]   instantaneously it wasn't because of years of discipleship and years of
[00:13:56.160 --> 00:14:03.320]   modeling and years of systematic teaching it just happened now does a
[00:14:03.320 --> 00:14:07.080]   Bible teach about discipleship yes does the Bible teach us about modeling yes
[00:14:07.080 --> 00:14:12.680]   are all those things necessary part of building a healthy church yes but at the
[00:14:12.680 --> 00:14:17.520]   core of what makes a healthy church is people who have been affected by the
[00:14:17.520 --> 00:14:25.000]   cross people who have been deeply affected see the power of the cross
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.040]   isn't simply that you didn't go to church and then now you attend church it
[00:14:29.040 --> 00:14:34.880]   changes everything about what we value what we are entertained by how we find
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.200]   encouragement what we consider to be a blessing in a secular world if you get a
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:45.720]   good job and you make a lot of money you say well I've been blessed but as a
[00:14:45.720 --> 00:14:50.120]   Christian we know that that shouldn't be our perspective because there's many
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.880]   Christians who lose their jobs because they've been blessed by God many
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:14:58.000]   Christians can't meet together with their families because they've been
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:04.920]   blessed by God I think the greatest testimony of the power of the cross has
[00:15:04.920 --> 00:15:10.800]   changed lives not how well the church is organized not how awesome the praise
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:17.160]   that is but change lives the greatest testimony of our of our lives a greater
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:26.680]   witness is your radically changed lives because of the cross see Philemon on the
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:33.800]   surface seems like just a you know an average letter you know of an apostle
[00:15:33.800 --> 00:15:37.120]   the pastor is concerned about his disciple and he's writing a letter hey
[00:15:37.120 --> 00:15:42.720]   you know would you receive him but I believe that it is a powerful testimony
[00:15:42.720 --> 00:15:47.560]   of the effects of the cross in the early church
[00:15:47.560 --> 00:15:54.760]   Philemon was probably a leader in Church of Colossae it says that those churches
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:59.320]   meeting at his house his wife the FIA is probably his wife archipis is his son
[00:15:59.320 --> 00:16:04.480]   and his and he's actually mentioned in Colossians 417 as a fellow companion of
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.600]   Apostle Paul so here is a prominent member in the Colossian Church most
[00:16:08.600 --> 00:16:12.560]   likely a wealthy man because they probably had a large enough house and
[00:16:12.560 --> 00:16:14.920]   said well what we're gonna meet is that well his house is probably the best
[00:16:14.920 --> 00:16:20.360]   house to meet and he probably had more than one slave several slaves you have
[00:16:20.360 --> 00:16:24.080]   to understand in order to really appreciate the letter that immediately
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:28.800]   when you hear the term slave we we attach to it all the negative evils of
[00:16:28.800 --> 00:16:34.320]   slavery that we know of in the last hundred years but understand that the
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:39.200]   system of slavery during this period was not considered an evil institution it
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:44.360]   was actually a part of their economy when somebody would be indentured or
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.920]   somebody with old money and they couldn't pay it back they would actually
[00:16:47.920 --> 00:16:52.200]   become an indentured servant for a period and then once it's paid off they
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:58.480]   would earn their freedom and in some instances finding a godly or a gracious
[00:16:58.480 --> 00:17:03.000]   master would have been the best way for that family to be protected and provided
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:08.080]   they couldn't do this on their own they didn't have a lot of rights so it's not
[00:17:08.080 --> 00:17:13.040]   the institution in itself was evil it's you had evil slave masters and sometimes
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:19.360]   you had evil slaves but if the institution in and of itself wasn't evil
[00:17:19.360 --> 00:17:24.320]   but it's in that context where Philemon decided you know what I'm gonna I'm just
[00:17:24.320 --> 00:17:28.440]   gonna take off and he we don't know the background story we don't know what
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:32.640]   kind of harm that he did maybe he stole certain things when he left but Philemon
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:38.280]   or Onesimus this runaway slave by the grace of God as Paul's of Paul is
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:42.520]   sitting in prison runs into him and he shares the gospel you know you would
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:46.360]   think that you know if you're laboring hard that if you get captured and you're
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:51.080]   sitting in prison you say okay timeout you know you know I've been running hard
[00:17:51.080 --> 00:17:54.840]   but why did God put me in here but that never stopped the pause of Paul he wrote
[00:17:54.840 --> 00:17:59.240]   you know he wrote letters he sent disciples he was still evangelizing in
[00:17:59.240 --> 00:18:04.120]   fact he was even thanking God that as a result of him being in chains that it
[00:18:04.120 --> 00:18:08.400]   was affecting other brothers to share the gospel even more and even the people
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:12.000]   who he was chained to can you imagine those Roman guards how many times they
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.080]   must have heard the gospel from this guy you know I mean he's writing the gospel
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:22.480]   and he said hey do you know what I'm you know so he never stops so even as he is
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:26.720]   chained to the Roman guard he's concerned about this runaway slave that
[00:18:26.720 --> 00:18:33.800]   again apparently may in the eyes of the world is completely insignificant and
[00:18:33.800 --> 00:18:38.560]   you see the power of the effect of the cross on all three of these people on
[00:18:38.560 --> 00:18:46.120]   Paul again sitting in prison if anybody had any right to say timeout you know
[00:18:46.120 --> 00:18:51.240]   I'm gonna take a break kind of like what we do we may be working hard but you
[00:18:51.240 --> 00:18:55.080]   know maybe something happens at your work or maybe you get sick or maybe one
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.040]   of your kids that could get sick and say timeout timeout right
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:04.200]   Apostle Paul had any right any anybody had any right to say that was a possible
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:09.800]   and he's labored he was beaten right stone thinking that he's dead and you
[00:19:09.800 --> 00:19:16.080]   know he's stone he's with a Roman guard chained 24/7 and yet he's writing this
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:22.520]   intimate letter to his fellow worker to receive him not not as a former slave
[00:19:22.520 --> 00:19:28.920]   but as your brother here's this you know previous slave you have to understand
[00:19:28.920 --> 00:19:34.000]   for him to even go back to where he came from legally he could have been
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:38.080]   executed for what he did they could have just said you know what you ripped me
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.600]   off and you hurt me and they could have just dragged him and by by legally they
[00:19:42.600 --> 00:19:48.240]   would have been justified to simply get rid of him so for him to even go back
[00:19:48.240 --> 00:19:54.000]   you could clearly see there was there was a power behind him he was affected
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:58.380]   by the cross and then for Philemon himself after all the things that he may
[00:19:58.380 --> 00:20:04.600]   have lost I mean just financial loss a slave running away and how he maybe he
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.560]   was a good slave owner and say you know he was treated him well and all of a
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:12.160]   sudden he just takes off like that and for him to even receive him none of this
[00:20:12.160 --> 00:20:18.920]   is he is humanly even imaginable if it wasn't the effects of the cross if the
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.800]   power of the gospel was not affecting every single one of these people this
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.160]   letter would not be here see the reason why this letter is so important because
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:32.480]   it reveals to us not only the power of the cross but it reveals to us God's
[00:20:32.480 --> 00:20:41.240]   tender heart for sinners you know you've probably read again in Psalm 8 3 to 4
[00:20:41.240 --> 00:20:46.480]   where David says who am I you know why are you so mindful of him he said this
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:51.200]   is what he says in Psalm 8 3 to 4 when I look at your heavens the work of your
[00:20:51.200 --> 00:20:56.800]   fingers the moon and the stars which you have set in place when I imagine who you
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:21:02.920]   are when I recognize that you are a all-powerful all-sovereign God and then
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:08.920]   he says considering who you are what is man that you are so mindful of him and
[00:21:08.920 --> 00:21:14.480]   the Son of Man that you care for him I think the reason why Christians
[00:21:14.480 --> 00:21:20.280]   sometimes get into this rut of why God why don't you do this and why didn't you
[00:21:20.280 --> 00:21:26.960]   answer my prayer is because we forget we forget who he is and we forget who we
[00:21:26.960 --> 00:21:35.800]   are considering who he is considering that he created the universe who are you
[00:21:35.800 --> 00:21:43.360]   and who am I to come before God and say why didn't you why don't you see what
[00:21:43.360 --> 00:21:49.800]   David says is the attitude that every Christian should have considering who
[00:21:49.800 --> 00:21:57.840]   you are considering what you have done why would you care why would you care
[00:21:57.840 --> 00:22:03.720]   why would you care about this runaway slave who's insignificant I mean you got
[00:22:03.720 --> 00:22:08.240]   the bigger world to worry about why disco why stop and give attention to
[00:22:08.240 --> 00:22:18.880]   this sinner see in Psalm 144 144 verse 4 it says man is like a breath his days
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:24.080]   are like passing shadow we're just a mist that comes and we disappear
[00:22:24.080 --> 00:22:28.480]   consider how insignificant we are in the light of the universe in light of
[00:22:28.480 --> 00:22:35.960]   eternity how much of our relationship is turned sour because we forget how
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:41.840]   insignificant we are how much of this church fellowship becomes tainted
[00:22:41.840 --> 00:22:48.760]   because we forget how insignificant we are we are a miss it's because we're we
[00:22:48.760 --> 00:22:53.520]   consider ourselves more important than we really are and we try so hard to
[00:22:53.520 --> 00:22:59.560]   elevate ourselves even just a little bit and it's that it's that process of
[00:22:59.560 --> 00:23:03.280]   wanting to be better than the next guy wanted to be elevated than the next
[00:23:03.280 --> 00:23:11.600]   person that is causing all this conflict he says who are we in light of who you
[00:23:11.600 --> 00:23:20.480]   are why would you even know my name why would you even know my name see every
[00:23:20.480 --> 00:23:26.800]   Christian the starting point in our relationship with God begins there and
[00:23:26.800 --> 00:23:30.280]   again in a culture where everybody's trying to all you know we weren't
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.920]   concerned about your self-esteem you know you're so low you're so great
[00:23:33.920 --> 00:23:37.680]   you're so awesome you know but the beginning point in our worst you know
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:45.440]   walk with God is you are nothing I said I got a jerk you know and come to be
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:50.440]   uplifted life is hard enough as it is but this that's what the scripture so I
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:58.200]   mean forget forgive the scripture just think logically have you seen how big
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:24:06.080]   this universe is how big this galaxy is we're smaller than a dust and we're
[00:24:06.080 --> 00:24:11.600]   trying so hard to be something you know he said knowing in light of who you are
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:17.040]   why would you even care why is this letter here why do you even think of us
[00:24:17.040 --> 00:24:23.320]   why do you even listen to us but the amazing thing about the gospel is he
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:30.560]   does I can't explain to you why because I don't know but he does in fact it's
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:34.960]   not even just a New Testament that is his nature that's who he is
[00:24:34.960 --> 00:24:40.720]   Deuteronomy 24 19 to 22 again if you just read it in passing like you're
[00:24:40.720 --> 00:24:43.840]   reading that you know like you're gonna read through the Bible and in in one
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:47.360]   year you just kind of read it it's one of those passages that you're not gonna
[00:24:47.360 --> 00:24:52.720]   really stop and think but I think one of the most amazing passages in the Old
[00:24:52.720 --> 00:24:57.760]   Testament is passages like this okay this is what it says Deuteronomy 24 19
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:25:03.440]   22 it's about harvesting in the law of harvesting when you reap your harvest in
[00:25:03.440 --> 00:25:07.920]   your field and forget a sheaf in the field you shall not go back to get it
[00:25:07.920 --> 00:25:12.720]   it shall be for the sojourners the fatherless and the widows that the Lord
[00:25:12.720 --> 00:25:18.800]   your God may bless you in all the work of your hands I know on the surface it's
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:24.800]   like okay says drop it don't pick it up right but think about what he is saying
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:29.080]   is it as you are harvested you worked hard and you're harvesting if you drop
[00:25:29.080 --> 00:25:34.840]   something don't turn around to pick it up keep going leave that for the
[00:25:34.840 --> 00:25:39.160]   sojourners of foreigners who have no way to eat leave that for the fatherless
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:43.800]   leave that for the widows and if you really want to be blessed do that and
[00:25:43.800 --> 00:25:47.320]   then he continues on when you beat your olive trees you shall not go over them
[00:25:47.320 --> 00:25:51.800]   again it shall be for the sojourners the fatherless and the widows when you're
[00:25:51.800 --> 00:25:57.920]   harvesting the olive trees and you don't get all of it leave it it's for the
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:26:02.240]   people that can't get it on their own 21 when you gather the grapes of the
[00:26:02.240 --> 00:26:05.680]   vineyard you shall not strip it afterward it shall be for the
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:09.600]   sojourners the fatherless and the widows you shall remember that you were a slave
[00:26:09.600 --> 00:26:16.400]   in the land of Egypt therefore I command you to do this what is he saying don't
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:21.280]   forget that you were the fatherless don't forget at one point you were the
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:28.000]   widows don't forget at one point you were a foreigner and so as I've been
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:37.400]   gracious to you be gracious to them see God has always been this God and again
[00:26:37.400 --> 00:26:41.320]   we get caught up and when we when we come into church and worship with that
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:46.440]   mentality is that you're supposed to love me God so if you love me I want you
[00:26:46.440 --> 00:26:49.040]   to love me this way I want you to answer this prayer and I want you to answer it
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:53.760]   this way this is what I want this is what blessing to me means and then when
[00:26:53.760 --> 00:26:58.960]   it doesn't happen that way we spend the rest of our time saying why why don't
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:03.880]   you do this for me why didn't you answer my prayer why didn't you give me this
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:11.440]   why didn't you give me health but every Christian who genuinely believes that
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:19.240]   Jesus Christ died for you even if the rest of our lives looks like Job's at
[00:27:19.240 --> 00:27:23.720]   the end of our life every single person is obligated to say thank you for saving
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:31.760]   my soul every single person must be able to say and and should say and natural
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:36.440]   response should be when I look at the heavens when I look at the stars your
[00:27:36.440 --> 00:27:42.640]   fingers your power and all that you are who am I that you would even know my
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:50.000]   name why would you care for me see that it's not just the Old Testament that's
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:53.160]   not just a God of the Old Testament you look in the New Testament first
[00:27:53.160 --> 00:27:57.440]   Corinthians 12 21 26 he said this is the identity of the community in the New
[00:27:57.440 --> 00:28:03.280]   Testament the eye cannot say to the hand I have no need of you nor again the head
[00:28:03.280 --> 00:28:07.320]   to the feet I have no need of you on the contrary the parts of the body that
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:12.120]   seem to be weaker are indispensable and on those parts of the body that we think
[00:28:12.120 --> 00:28:16.640]   less honorable we'd be so greater honor and our armors that aren't presentable
[00:28:16.640 --> 00:28:22.000]   parts are treated with greater modesty which are more presentable parts do not
[00:28:22.000 --> 00:28:25.800]   require but God has so composed the body giving greater honor to the part that
[00:28:25.800 --> 00:28:29.480]   lacked it that there may be no division in the body but that the members may
[00:28:29.480 --> 00:28:33.200]   have the same care for one another if one member suffers all suffer if one
[00:28:33.200 --> 00:28:39.320]   member is honored all rejoice together is that the power of the gospel
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:44.940]   community is a community that's been affected by the cross so deeply that we
[00:28:44.940 --> 00:28:50.520]   don't honor people who are honorable in the world but it's the fatherless it's
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:54.160]   the widows it's the people who are in need to be gracious to them because God's
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:59.320]   been gracious to us that the greatest reflection of the power of the cross in
[00:28:59.320 --> 00:29:04.320]   us is not our ability to speak is not our ability to organize it's our ability
[00:29:04.320 --> 00:29:12.000]   to reflect that grace in us to people who don't deserve it that's that's the
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:17.600]   foundation in which God calls us to stand to preach the gospel is not how
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.440]   well it's organized and how much theology we have and how much knowledge
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:27.480]   we can disseminate is how deeply have we been affected by the cross that's why
[00:29:27.480 --> 00:29:31.600]   Jesus asked it's no it's not good enough to say this is what my church believes
[00:29:31.600 --> 00:29:35.480]   it's not good enough to say that this is what evangelical Christians believe
[00:29:35.480 --> 00:29:41.920]   this is what Calvin believed this is what Piper believes what do you believe
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:49.000]   sometimes we can get caught up that our relationship with God is always just
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.880]   piggybacking off of somebody else it's not enough to say that loving God is
[00:29:55.880 --> 00:30:03.800]   most important how about you are you convinced that God loves you because the
[00:30:03.800 --> 00:30:08.160]   scripture tells us and again the reason why I want to spend some time in this
[00:30:08.160 --> 00:30:15.760]   book in this letter is because it is a it is a testimony of how the cross
[00:30:15.760 --> 00:30:23.080]   affects even the lowliest person a former Pharisee and a former slave owner
[00:30:23.080 --> 00:30:29.960]   how they became brothers in Christ and how God brings them together to build a
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:41.920]   church how insignificant people do you know that that God loves you not the
[00:30:41.920 --> 00:30:50.640]   church not simply the world but you see you know when I when I was a younger
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:55.200]   Christian in college I remember doing Bible study with one of my former Bible
[00:30:55.200 --> 00:31:00.360]   study leaders and he I remember him saying the greatest commandment of the
[00:31:00.360 --> 00:31:03.120]   scripture is love the Lord your God with all your heart soul mind and strength
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:07.760]   and love your neighbor as yourself these are the two greatest commandment and I
[00:31:07.760 --> 00:31:12.640]   was really wrestling with that because I can say I love the image of God like the
[00:31:12.640 --> 00:31:18.200]   idea of a God who gave his only begotten Son I love that you know I love the idea
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:23.080]   of a church built upon his sacrifice I love that I love the fact that the door
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:29.600]   has been opened that now I have I have access to God I love all of that but do
[00:31:29.600 --> 00:31:35.880]   you love God do you love God not the idea of God not the image of God not the
[00:31:35.880 --> 00:31:42.200]   theology of God but do you love God and I couldn't honestly say yes because I
[00:31:42.200 --> 00:31:49.440]   love everything about God but to love God I'm not sure and so I started asking
[00:31:49.440 --> 00:31:52.280]   if that's the greatest commandment that should be my greatest pursuit right
[00:31:52.280 --> 00:31:56.360]   right before like I want to share the gospel I'm gonna do all this like do I
[00:31:56.360 --> 00:32:04.200]   love God and I couldn't honestly say yes as committed as I was and so I started
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:08.840]   asking how do you do that what do you do to love God so you know I got all kinds
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.600]   of answers like say I love you God a hundred times and if you say it enough
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:17.840]   in the closet then you're gonna see your heart change and and even when I heard
[00:32:17.840 --> 00:32:21.080]   it it's like that doesn't sound right but I'll do it and you know so I tried
[00:32:21.080 --> 00:32:25.320]   it you know and I tried it a lot I wouldn't can I every time I get
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.920]   frustrated in prayer I was I love you I love you I love you I love you I love
[00:32:27.920 --> 00:32:30.600]   you God he said a hundred times so I gotta make sure it's a hundred times you
[00:32:30.600 --> 00:32:35.720]   know I love you guys I'm good and at the end of it's like this can't be it right
[00:32:35.720 --> 00:32:40.120]   this can't be it and I was really wrestling with that like how do I Lord I
[00:32:40.120 --> 00:32:44.720]   want to love you but I can't honestly say that right I don't know if I love
[00:32:44.720 --> 00:32:49.640]   you like I love my mom or my family and then you know it's just like to have
[00:32:49.640 --> 00:32:53.960]   that kind of affection for him that do I get offended when people offend his name
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:57.160]   like I would be offended by if somebody offended somebody I love and I don't
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:33:03.200]   know if I could say that well early on in college you know I had to I had to
[00:33:03.200 --> 00:33:08.480]   work and I got this job at Hughes Aircraft and I was working from from I
[00:33:08.480 --> 00:33:13.360]   think five to about two in the morning and I was completely isolated for about
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:18.640]   eight eight and a half hours a day and I would get a dinner break and I would
[00:33:18.640 --> 00:33:23.440]   deliberately go to Pioneer Chicken in that area just so that I can be around
[00:33:23.440 --> 00:33:28.120]   people because I was I was cleaning out bungalows you know it basically is
[00:33:28.120 --> 00:33:31.840]   everybody went home it's dark and I would pick up trash and all that and it
[00:33:31.840 --> 00:33:35.280]   was probably the most loneliest period of my life you know I'm a pretty social
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:39.720]   person but there was a long period of time probably about a year year and a
[00:33:39.720 --> 00:33:43.920]   half where I had very little interaction with people and when I say very little
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.960]   I mean I mean I'm almost none I wasn't living at home so my my you know I
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:53.880]   didn't even see my family and so I'll go to work from five to two and then you
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:58.520]   come home and then I'll get up and then go to school and I just had very little
[00:33:58.520 --> 00:34:04.520]   contact and I remember there was this one time I was thinking that if I died
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:08.640]   here or if I just disappeared if I just walked away I wonder how long it would
[00:34:08.640 --> 00:34:15.440]   take before somebody realizes that I'm gone it was I mean it was pretty
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:19.280]   depressing you know and right in the middle of that I remember having a
[00:34:19.280 --> 00:34:23.640]   birthday and I forgot how old I think I was about 18 or 19 and the whole day I
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:27.480]   knew that I wasn't gonna run into anybody you know eventually I would
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:30.800]   probably go home and then my family would celebrate it but you know but that
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.840]   particular day I was walking around and and I was like nobody knows I mean and
[00:34:34.840 --> 00:34:38.440]   I'm not a priest I'm not like a necessarily sentimental like what was me
[00:34:38.440 --> 00:34:42.480]   type of guy but that day it was pretty depressing you know it's like I wonder
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.120]   if anybody would know and I remember it right in the middle of all of that you
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:51.040]   know I was in the closet and I was doing my devotions and I was I was I was
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.520]   praying and I was going through scripture and it just kind of hit me
[00:34:53.520 --> 00:34:59.480]   again if I disappeared here I wonder how long it would take before somebody would
[00:34:59.480 --> 00:35:03.360]   recognize that I'm gone and so in my mind I'm thinking two months maybe you
[00:35:03.360 --> 00:35:07.200]   know two months and then my mom's gonna hey where's Peter you know I would think
[00:35:07.200 --> 00:35:11.280]   my mom would be the first one that would look for me and then the next he would
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:13.960]   probably send my older brother come look for me because that's usually the
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:18.440]   pattern you know and then I said I would talk about that's the pattern then it
[00:35:18.440 --> 00:35:26.160]   just hit me like a ton of bricks right he who did not spare his own son how
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:31.480]   will he not along with him give you everything if God knew you enough that
[00:35:31.480 --> 00:35:36.200]   to send his only begotten son do you not think that he knows you're here he
[00:35:36.200 --> 00:35:41.560]   counts every hair on your head he loves you more than you can possibly imagine
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:47.080]   it just broke me in the closet you know it's like and it was like what was me
[00:35:47.080 --> 00:35:53.920]   I'm so lonely you know nobody knows where I am and it's just like I know you
[00:35:53.920 --> 00:36:03.600]   I love you and I can honestly tell you it was probably the hardest period of my
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:09.800]   life because I was so isolated for such a long time during that period but God
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:17.600]   isolated me and he he became so real to me you know it says in first John we
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.120]   love because he first loved us and I realize when you're not convinced of his
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:29.560]   love for you we go through the mechanics because we think that's the right thing
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:36.880]   to do but it's not your joy it's not what brings life you do it because
[00:36:36.880 --> 00:36:43.160]   you're supposed to do it but when you're in love that's where the greatest joy
[00:36:43.160 --> 00:36:49.640]   comes from that's where you feel the most alive when you're the nearest to
[00:36:49.640 --> 00:36:57.120]   Christ when somebody who loves you that much and he's that powerful and is that
[00:36:57.120 --> 00:37:04.080]   that knowledgeable and is that caring and then he's for you what can possibly
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:12.680]   happen in this life that would cause us to say why God you see Paul writes this
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:18.560]   letter and he begins a letter by saying Paul a prisoner for Christ Jesus in
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:23.120]   almost every other letter he says Paul an apostle of Jesus Christ he he brings
[00:37:23.120 --> 00:37:27.840]   his authority because he needs to speak to them with authority I'm speaking on
[00:37:27.840 --> 00:37:31.320]   behalf of Christ here's wrong things here's wrong behavior that needs to be
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:37.920]   fixed but in this letter he humbles himself as a lowly prisoner and the
[00:37:37.920 --> 00:37:42.160]   reason why he does that is because he says he explains in finally even eight
[00:37:42.160 --> 00:37:46.360]   and nine says according accordingly though I am bold enough in Christ to
[00:37:46.360 --> 00:37:51.960]   command you to do what he is what is required yet for love's sake I prefer to
[00:37:51.960 --> 00:37:59.880]   appeal to you I Paul an old man and now a prisoner also for Christ Jesus I'm not
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:04.520]   gonna command you even though I have the authority I'm not gonna shake my fist
[00:38:04.520 --> 00:38:10.160]   and say how can you possibly do this is that I'm a prisoner I lost all things
[00:38:10.160 --> 00:38:19.360]   for the sake of Christ I'm sitting in prison because of Jesus and now you as
[00:38:19.360 --> 00:38:26.760]   Christ has called me now you I appeal to you as a humbled brother in prison would
[00:38:26.760 --> 00:38:31.720]   you forgive your brother would you receive him not as a slave but as your
[00:38:31.720 --> 00:38:37.840]   brother I appeal to you in the power of the cross that's an appeal to every
[00:38:37.840 --> 00:38:45.280]   single one of us in light of what he has done for us forgive your brother forgive
[00:38:45.280 --> 00:38:54.800]   your sister in light of what he has done for us that the greatest fruit of his
[00:38:54.800 --> 00:39:02.000]   power his cross in us is that we would also be gracious people so I pray that
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:05.200]   the time that we spend in the book of Philemon that we would not simply learn
[00:39:05.200 --> 00:39:08.520]   about well here's a possible here's what slavery looked like in the early church
[00:39:08.520 --> 00:39:13.320]   here's what Colossae looked like here's this man of God that behind all of this
[00:39:13.320 --> 00:39:19.640]   that you would see a tender loving God who cares for insignificant people
[00:39:19.640 --> 00:39:25.520]   that's you that's me and that we would not simply declare his love in our songs
[00:39:25.520 --> 00:39:33.880]   but that we can honestly say that we love Jesus that this is a God worth
[00:39:33.880 --> 00:39:40.000]   following this is a God worth sacrificing this is a God worth loving
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:44.800]   and worshiping so I pray that behind all of this that we would fall love fall in
[00:39:44.800 --> 00:39:47.960]   love with Christ let's pray
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:57.960]   I want to encourage you as our worship team comes up and again that we would
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:40:03.280]   take time that I know there's there's things that on your mind you have you
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:07.880]   know work you have paper you have responsibilities but in the midst of all
[00:40:07.880 --> 00:40:13.720]   of this that we would take a step back and say Lord I want to love you with all
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:17.360]   my heart I've drifted away and it's been a long
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:22.680]   time so I've been impacted by your grace I want to confess my love to you that it
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.240]   would not just be words to take some time to come before the Lord and just
[00:40:27.240 --> 00:40:33.400]   confess Lord help me help me to recognize your great love for me that I
[00:40:33.400 --> 00:40:36.760]   would have a reasonable response in loving you let's take some time to pray
[00:40:36.760 --> 00:40:40.840]   as our worship team leads us
[00:40:40.840 --> 00:40:42.200]   (music)
