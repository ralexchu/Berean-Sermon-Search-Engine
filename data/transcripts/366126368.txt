[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.920]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 6, and I'll be reading
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:17.360]   from verse 13 all the way down to verse 20.
[00:00:17.360 --> 00:00:29.120]   Hebrews chapter 6, verse 13 to 20.
[00:00:29.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   And we'll be in chapter 7 a few weeks later.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:36.200]   Alright, verse 13 and on.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.720]   For when God made the promise to Abraham, since he could swear by no one greater, he
[00:00:40.720 --> 00:00:45.400]   swore by himself, saying, "I will surely bless you, and I will surely multiply you."
[00:00:45.400 --> 00:00:48.500]   And so having patiently waited, he obtained the promise.
[00:00:48.500 --> 00:00:53.640]   For men swear by one greater than themselves, and with them an oath given as confirmation
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.800]   is the end of every dispute.
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:01:00.120]   In the same way, God desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise the unchangeableness
[00:01:00.120 --> 00:01:03.240]   of his purpose, interposed with an oath.
[00:01:03.240 --> 00:01:07.440]   So that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:12.240]   taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.460]   This hope we have as an anchor of the soul, a hope both sure and steadfast, and one which
[00:01:16.460 --> 00:01:21.600]   enters within the veil, where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us, having become a high
[00:01:21.600 --> 00:01:24.520]   priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek.
[00:01:24.520 --> 00:01:27.320]   Let's pray.
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:32.240]   Father, we pray for your guidance.
[00:01:32.240 --> 00:01:38.200]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to be revealed in a very powerful and tangible way.
[00:01:38.200 --> 00:01:43.480]   We pray for your word, Lord God, that you are ordained to speak to us, to plant seeds
[00:01:43.480 --> 00:01:48.680]   in us, that we may bear fruit, and that you would stir in us a hungering and thirsting
[00:01:48.680 --> 00:01:53.800]   for righteousness, to be in the presence of Christ, that all that we do, all our affections,
[00:01:53.800 --> 00:01:57.360]   Lord, would lean toward him more and more each day.
[00:01:57.360 --> 00:02:00.960]   So I pray that you would ordain this time, may it be a time of genuine worship before
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:01.960]   you.
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:04.960]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:11.360]   Okay, so I think most of you guys already know that I'll be heading into sabbatical
[00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.200]   after today.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:18.840]   So next Sunday, myself and a pastor from Cross Life and another member, we're going to be
[00:02:18.840 --> 00:02:23.200]   headed out to India to do pastoral training out there in the villages, and we're going
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:26.080]   to be out there for about a week time.
[00:02:26.080 --> 00:02:30.920]   Then after that I'll be headed out to Korea, and I have to give a sermon at a church, and
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.640]   then Esther's going to come join me, and so we're going to be headed out there for a little
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:36.640]   bit.
[00:02:36.640 --> 00:02:41.120]   So I'll be gone physically for a little bit, and then I'll be back here I think three weeks
[00:02:41.120 --> 00:02:44.460]   later.
[00:02:44.460 --> 00:02:47.240]   People have been asking me, like, "What are you going to do in your sabbatical?"
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:49.120]   That's the most common question.
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:52.060]   You know, you have three months of doing nothing.
[00:02:52.060 --> 00:02:53.980]   So what are you going to do?
[00:02:53.980 --> 00:02:56.320]   I don't have a specific plan.
[00:02:56.320 --> 00:02:58.480]   You know, when people ask me, "What do you do on your free time?"
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:00.720]   I don't know what that even means.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:06.780]   You know, since I've been a youth pastor since I was 19, and so my schedule has been dictated
[00:03:06.780 --> 00:03:11.300]   by the group that I've been leading since I was a teen myself.
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:13.280]   And so I don't know what that feels like.
[00:03:13.280 --> 00:03:19.440]   You know, so I got married early, I was a youth pastor from 19 to 20, and so every summer
[00:03:19.440 --> 00:03:23.120]   retreat speaking, you know, every Sunday speaking.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.520]   And so for the first time, and I've taken breaks before, maybe I've taken like two,
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.360]   three weeks off, but usually just the pulpit, but the rest of ministry went on and I was
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:36.240]   in Bible study and I was engaged in church, but this is the first time when I'm actually
[00:03:36.240 --> 00:03:42.100]   taking a longer break and the elders are actually telling me to stay away from church, period.
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:47.880]   So I don't know if that's going to happen, but I will be around, I just won't be actively
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:49.520]   engaged in ministry.
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:55.120]   So you know, only thing I have in mind is I want to take care of my health and I want
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:00.480]   to spend more extended time just to focus on my family and I have some gardening to
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:01.480]   do.
[00:04:01.480 --> 00:04:06.520]   And so I got some stuff that I have on schedule, but other than that, you know, I'll explain
[00:04:06.520 --> 00:04:09.160]   a little bit.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:13.280]   Why after almost 23 years am I taking this now?
[00:04:13.280 --> 00:04:16.800]   You know, I think previously I don't think I was in a situation where I would have felt
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:21.760]   comfortable just not being on the pulpit and not engaged in ministry because, you know,
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:25.240]   early on in ministry, it was obviously I was the only pastor and then Pastor Aaron was
[00:04:25.240 --> 00:04:29.680]   here and then we had interns at church, but they weren't fully involved yet.
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:34.140]   They were just being trained and so if I left earlier, I would have just had to dump everything
[00:04:34.140 --> 00:04:37.440]   on Pastor Aaron and so I didn't feel right doing that.
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:43.700]   And then after that, Pastor Mark took his spot and so it was me and him for a long time.
[00:04:43.700 --> 00:04:48.420]   So if I left then, I would have ended up dumping everything on him and he would have went nuts.
[00:04:48.420 --> 00:04:54.260]   And so for the first time in our church history, I feel that our church is in good hands.
[00:04:54.260 --> 00:04:59.320]   Not that it wasn't before, but that it's good enough hands where we have, you know, elders
[00:04:59.320 --> 00:05:01.560]   in the church.
[00:05:01.560 --> 00:05:07.060]   We had, you know, Phillip and Joe, who's been elders for a very long time in our church
[00:05:07.060 --> 00:05:13.720]   and they have been tested and I can honestly say that, you know, both of them has been
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:19.340]   tested in every way in the church and their character is something to me that stands out.
[00:05:19.340 --> 00:05:23.760]   They are gifted in areas and even their temperament is so different than mine.
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:24.760]   It kind of keeps me balanced.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:29.500]   There's a lot of ways that they respond to things that I observe and I'm encouraged and
[00:05:29.500 --> 00:05:32.300]   challenged by.
[00:05:32.300 --> 00:05:35.020]   Adding Elder James to the church has been a huge help.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:40.540]   You know, I tell them as much as I can, but, you know, I remember when he was a younger
[00:05:40.540 --> 00:05:46.620]   man back in college and right out of college, like his, you know, he brought it on himself
[00:05:46.620 --> 00:05:48.580]   to be my bodyguard.
[00:05:48.580 --> 00:05:53.360]   And so whenever I would go to speak somewhere, he would kind of ask and sometimes tag along
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.300]   and he would wear his leather jacket, you know, to intimidate people.
[00:05:58.300 --> 00:06:02.940]   And so, you know, he said like he wanted to be my bodyguard and to have, you know, somebody
[00:06:02.940 --> 00:06:06.060]   who has my back like that on the team to work together.
[00:06:06.060 --> 00:06:10.600]   I mean, it's been a huge encouragement just even in the short period of time, you know,
[00:06:10.600 --> 00:06:13.700]   and you guys are good hands with the elders.
[00:06:13.700 --> 00:06:16.300]   We've added two pastors.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:22.180]   We had added Pastor Nate to the church and he's the only pastor in our 22, 23 years of
[00:06:22.180 --> 00:06:25.320]   history that we've ever brought from outside the church.
[00:06:25.320 --> 00:06:29.740]   And so it was somewhat of a risk to bring him, but he's somebody that we've been talking
[00:06:29.740 --> 00:06:33.780]   about, Pastor Mark and I have been talking about him for years.
[00:06:33.780 --> 00:06:37.660]   If we ever did bring anybody from outside, he's the only person that we can possibly
[00:06:37.660 --> 00:06:38.660]   think of.
[00:06:38.660 --> 00:06:42.580]   And so we've done plenty of research, you know, thinking about him, would he ever be
[00:06:42.580 --> 00:06:43.580]   interested?
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:47.640]   And so when we actually did even contact him, it was just for the future.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:51.620]   If by any chance something happens and you think you're going to move, you know, consider
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:57.460]   us and just by God's providence, it just happened that he was actually having that conversation
[00:06:57.460 --> 00:07:00.140]   with his staff and his wife right when we came to him.
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:06.240]   And so when he came in, it's been about a year, almost two years, and just seamlessly
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:10.660]   he fit into our church and our college and our whole church has benefited just in the
[00:07:10.660 --> 00:07:12.740]   short time that he's been here.
[00:07:12.740 --> 00:07:17.580]   Pastor Peter Chong, you know, was an intern before he went out to China and thinking that
[00:07:17.580 --> 00:07:21.620]   he was going to come back in a year, but he rebelled and stayed three more years after
[00:07:21.620 --> 00:07:22.620]   that.
[00:07:22.620 --> 00:07:27.420]   And then like a prodigal son, instead of coming back, he went to Korea for five years to travel.
[00:07:27.420 --> 00:07:30.420]   He traveled all over the world, you know, for compassion.
[00:07:30.420 --> 00:07:35.680]   And he's probably traveled and seen more things than 99.9% of the world will ever see.
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:40.100]   And so when he came back, we knew he was going to be a huge asset because we knew his sharp
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.420]   memory, we knew his teaching ability, but, you know, one of the things that I've noticed
[00:07:44.420 --> 00:07:49.740]   since he came back is his shepherd's heart and how tender his heart is for the church
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.880]   people.
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:56.300]   And I don't have to say, I think many of you have been deeply affected by him already.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.440]   And so we knew that he was going to be a benefit, you know, when he came, but there's areas
[00:08:01.440 --> 00:08:05.360]   of the church that he's been helping out in that we didn't even know we had holes in until
[00:08:05.360 --> 00:08:06.360]   he came.
[00:08:06.360 --> 00:08:08.140]   So he's been a huge help to us.
[00:08:08.140 --> 00:08:12.740]   And then Pastor Mark, you know, I can't say enough, you know, last, I don't know how many
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:16.100]   years, six, seven, eight years, I don't think our church would have lasted.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:18.440]   I don't think I would have lasted without him.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:23.660]   You know, I feel like he's a guy that I went to battle with multiple times, you know, we
[00:08:23.660 --> 00:08:25.620]   went to war and came back together.
[00:08:25.620 --> 00:08:31.260]   And so, you know, I've shared this so many times, but I remember it's very specifically.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:37.100]   And it's not just this one time, but that event kind of solidified for me, you know,
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:41.260]   that God placed him in my life for my personal encouragement.
[00:08:41.260 --> 00:08:45.460]   And you know, years ago on Thanksgiving, at Thanksgiving, I think it was about five years
[00:08:45.460 --> 00:08:51.020]   ago, five or six years ago, I got a phone call that our church was flooded, not this
[00:08:51.020 --> 00:08:52.880]   church, but the church that we were at.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:08:56.660]   And so I had to leave our family Thanksgiving dinner and I came to church and I opened the
[00:08:56.660 --> 00:09:00.700]   door and found our church flooded, about three inches of water.
[00:09:00.700 --> 00:09:04.740]   And you know, obviously I was really distraught because if we don't have those rooms, you
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:06.220]   know, our children would have nowhere to go.
[00:09:06.220 --> 00:09:08.940]   They would have to have their Sunday school in the parking lot.
[00:09:08.940 --> 00:09:12.540]   And so there's no way that I'm going to be able to take care of this.
[00:09:12.540 --> 00:09:16.340]   And so I was just with the door open, I tried to drain the water as much as possible, but
[00:09:16.340 --> 00:09:17.340]   there's no way.
[00:09:17.340 --> 00:09:21.880]   And then I felt bad calling anybody at church because it was Thanksgiving dinner.
[00:09:21.880 --> 00:09:24.980]   So if I called them, they would have to leave their home and come.
[00:09:24.980 --> 00:09:28.180]   And as I was thinking that, I saw Pastor Mark just drive up.
[00:09:28.180 --> 00:09:29.220]   I didn't ask him to come.
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:30.580]   He found out what was happening.
[00:09:30.580 --> 00:09:31.820]   He drove up.
[00:09:31.820 --> 00:09:36.100]   And so we stayed all night together till five or six in the morning, just draining the water,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:40.740]   pulling the carpet out, moving all the furniture out of that room and try to dry it out.
[00:09:40.740 --> 00:09:45.100]   And I think I was there till about seven in the morning and there was still a lot to do
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:48.440]   to prepare and dry it out for the children to come the next day.
[00:09:48.440 --> 00:09:52.180]   But he was worried about me that, you know, he knew that I had to preach the next day.
[00:09:52.180 --> 00:09:56.220]   So he said, "You know, you need to go home and get some sleep and get ready for Sunday.
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   I'll take care of this."
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:01.180]   And so he called a few people who were available, came, and he finished the work.
[00:10:01.180 --> 00:10:05.780]   And so by the time we came on Sunday, we had it ready enough so that we can use it that
[00:10:05.780 --> 00:10:07.740]   Sunday and then take care of it.
[00:10:07.740 --> 00:10:12.540]   And so I remember going home just with a huge sigh of relief because Pastor Mark just showed
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:13.980]   up, you know.
[00:10:13.980 --> 00:10:17.700]   And I just give you that as an example because that's how he's been all these years with
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:22.860]   me, you know, whether it's the lights, the toilets, or, you know, even just this building,
[00:10:22.860 --> 00:10:23.860]   right?
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:27.300]   And we literally went to war together while we were here.
[00:10:27.300 --> 00:10:29.060]   And so, yeah, I can't say enough.
[00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:31.060]   Pastor Mark has been my right-hand man.
[00:10:31.060 --> 00:10:35.700]   And I tell Esther, you know, God knew that I needed somebody like her in my life to balance
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:36.980]   me out.
[00:10:36.980 --> 00:10:44.180]   And Pastor Mark is kind of like my wife at the church in a good way, right?
[00:10:44.180 --> 00:10:45.740]   A good way.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.300]   So God knew what I needed and he kind of balances me out.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:51.500]   But he kind of like, there's nothing beneath him.
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:53.020]   He's willing to do whatever it takes.
[00:10:53.020 --> 00:10:54.580]   And so he's been a huge encouragement to me.
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:59.500]   So I feel comforted to know that the church is in good hands, even if it's just for a
[00:10:59.500 --> 00:11:01.540]   short period of time.
[00:11:01.540 --> 00:11:05.300]   You know, when people ask me what I love about Berea, I love the people more than anything
[00:11:05.300 --> 00:11:06.700]   else.
[00:11:06.700 --> 00:11:08.940]   But in particular, our leadership, you know.
[00:11:08.940 --> 00:11:11.660]   Our Saturday morning meetings is not a burden.
[00:11:11.660 --> 00:11:15.780]   You know, I look forward to just spending time with our leadership and just, you know,
[00:11:15.780 --> 00:11:20.820]   whether it's, you know, serious stuff or joking around, these are my brothers.
[00:11:20.820 --> 00:11:23.260]   These are the guys that we're laboring together.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:29.620]   And so that's part, obviously a big part of the reason why I feel that I can do that.
[00:11:29.620 --> 00:11:32.340]   But what is the purpose of a sabbatical?
[00:11:32.340 --> 00:11:37.460]   You know, sabbatical, just to kind of, to put it in a layman's term, is kind of like
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:38.460]   praying.
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:43.340]   You know, we pray to kind of break away, to connect with God, and then if we want to really
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.380]   be serious, we start fasting.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:50.500]   We'll set aside a day where we kind of break away from everything and to focus our attention
[00:11:50.500 --> 00:11:51.920]   on God.
[00:11:51.920 --> 00:11:55.460]   So sabbatical is kind of like fasting.
[00:11:55.460 --> 00:12:01.020]   To take a break from your daily routines and to be able to ask the question and answer
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:05.700]   this question, "Is Christ enough?
[00:12:05.700 --> 00:12:07.660]   Is Christ enough?"
[00:12:07.660 --> 00:12:10.980]   And I know that this is a cliche and you've probably heard it hundreds of times if you've
[00:12:10.980 --> 00:12:17.860]   been a Christian for a while, but to be able to answer that question emphatically, yes.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:21.540]   And it's easy to answer that question in the midst of routine.
[00:12:21.540 --> 00:12:25.580]   You wake up in the morning and you don't have time to really deeply think, especially if
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:28.140]   you have children and you're busy at work.
[00:12:28.140 --> 00:12:29.700]   You don't have time to think about that.
[00:12:29.700 --> 00:12:33.140]   Maybe you give a couple minute here, a couple minute there, but to really contemplate and
[00:12:33.140 --> 00:12:41.820]   think, "If God took away your friends, your health, your job, maybe even the church, is
[00:12:41.820 --> 00:12:44.540]   Christ enough?
[00:12:44.540 --> 00:12:48.140]   Or is it Christ and other things?
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.740]   Christ and my friends, Christ and my future, Christ and my bank account?"
[00:12:52.740 --> 00:12:57.740]   And so the time of sabbatical is really to kind of take time off to answer that question
[00:12:57.740 --> 00:13:03.340]   and to refresh my convictions, "Is Christ truly enough?"
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:09.500]   And really, that's the question that the author of Hebrews has been asking this question to
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:13.740]   the readers, "Is Christ enough?"
[00:13:13.740 --> 00:13:18.820]   And it's because they couldn't answer this question, that's why they were drifting.
[00:13:18.820 --> 00:13:20.480]   At one point it was.
[00:13:20.480 --> 00:13:22.940]   They were willing to get their properties confiscated.
[00:13:22.940 --> 00:13:26.260]   When their friends were going to jail, they were fellowshipping with them, supporting
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.260]   them.
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:31.980]   But at some point, that pressure of picking up their cross and living a life of suffering
[00:13:31.980 --> 00:13:36.660]   and denial got to them, and so they began to drift back into their old life.
[00:13:36.660 --> 00:13:41.460]   So they were holding on to a form of Judaism, and they were trying to hold on to the newfound
[00:13:41.460 --> 00:13:46.460]   life in Christ, and they were trying to synchronize these things so that they could make it work
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:47.460]   for them.
[00:13:47.460 --> 00:13:54.180]   But the whole book of Hebrews is to continue to ask them, "Do you really know this Christ?
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.140]   And is Christ ultimately enough?
[00:13:57.140 --> 00:14:04.060]   Is it Christ and friends, Christ in church, Christ in the family, or is it just Christ?"
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:08.220]   In verse 13 it says, "When God made the promise to Abraham, since he could not swear by no
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:12.180]   one greater, he swore by himself."
[00:14:12.180 --> 00:14:20.080]   Verse 13 to 16 is to remind us that the promise that he made, that he couldn't say it with
[00:14:20.080 --> 00:14:28.300]   more emphasis than by invoking his own name, is Christ truly enough?
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.980]   You know, verse 17 is written when it says, "I will surely bless you, and I will surely
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:33.980]   multiply you."
[00:14:33.980 --> 00:14:37.580]   The context of this verse is extremely important, because if you don't understand the context
[00:14:37.580 --> 00:14:41.280]   of this, you may just kind of extrapolate what you want from it.
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.740]   The context of this verse is given to Abraham and his descendants after God asks Abraham
[00:14:47.740 --> 00:14:50.380]   to sacrifice Isaac.
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:55.280]   Now you have to understand the historical context of who Isaac is.
[00:14:55.280 --> 00:14:59.300]   God called Abraham from his homeland, Ur of Chaldeans.
[00:14:59.300 --> 00:15:01.740]   Abraham was already a very wealthy man.
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:05.460]   When he left Ur of Chaldeans, he didn't leave with an empty bag.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.020]   He had a caravan of people.
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.540]   He was already a very rich man.
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:15.280]   So for God to enter into his life and say, "Pack up your bags and go into the desert,"
[00:15:15.280 --> 00:15:16.280]   it wouldn't make any sense.
[00:15:16.280 --> 00:15:17.280]   Like, why would you do that?
[00:15:17.280 --> 00:15:21.880]   Why would you go into the desert, risking your life with all these powerful enemies
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:25.800]   surrounding you, simply because God told him to?
[00:15:25.800 --> 00:15:29.560]   And that's why Abraham was considered a man of God, because of his faith.
[00:15:29.560 --> 00:15:33.920]   Because God told him to, and he believed him, he packed up his bags and family, and he went.
[00:15:33.920 --> 00:15:39.760]   And so Genesis chapter 12, God makes this promise, that because you obey me, I will
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:40.800]   bless you.
[00:15:40.800 --> 00:15:44.840]   I will give you land, I will multiply your children, and as I bless you, I will bless
[00:15:44.840 --> 00:15:45.840]   the whole world.
[00:15:45.840 --> 00:15:49.600]   This was a promise that God made to Abraham and ultimately to the world.
[00:15:49.600 --> 00:15:54.760]   In Genesis chapter 15, he ratifies this promise with a covenant.
[00:15:54.760 --> 00:15:58.960]   And typically at that time, when people entered a covenant, they would cut animals in half,
[00:15:58.960 --> 00:16:03.080]   put it in a row, and the two people who entered the covenant would hold hands, and they would
[00:16:03.080 --> 00:16:04.800]   walk down this aisle.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:10.120]   And the purpose of this was to say, "If any party on either side breaks this covenant,
[00:16:10.120 --> 00:16:13.440]   let them be like these animals, to be slaughtered."
[00:16:13.440 --> 00:16:15.720]   That's how they entered into the covenant.
[00:16:15.720 --> 00:16:21.680]   But this covenant that we see in Genesis chapter 15, God sets up this row with animals, and
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:26.800]   instead of Abraham entering into this covenant, Abraham actually falls asleep.
[00:16:26.800 --> 00:16:29.280]   And God enters through this covenant by himself.
[00:16:29.280 --> 00:16:33.640]   Did you know that the Christian wedding is representative of that covenant?
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:37.000]   And that's why we sit on the aisles, and we have one party sitting on one side, and then
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.480]   the other party sitting on the other side, because it signifies the covenant that God
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:43.540]   made with his people.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.960]   But it was a unilateral covenant.
[00:16:45.960 --> 00:16:49.880]   It was not a covenant that he made with Abraham, saying, "If you do your part, I will do my
[00:16:49.880 --> 00:16:50.880]   part."
[00:16:50.880 --> 00:16:55.720]   God was making a promise to Abraham and to the rest of the world that he is going to
[00:16:55.720 --> 00:16:57.360]   do this.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:04.560]   And it is in that context where God tells him this, but it takes 25 years before he
[00:17:04.560 --> 00:17:08.360]   ever has his legitimate child, Isaac.
[00:17:08.360 --> 00:17:10.320]   25 years.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:13.040]   He wasn't a 25-year-old man when he left the world of Chaldeans.
[00:17:13.040 --> 00:17:14.800]   Do you know how old he was?
[00:17:14.800 --> 00:17:15.800]   He was 75.
[00:17:15.800 --> 00:17:20.880]   Now, some of us may think, "Well, 75 back then, maybe that was equivalent to 25."
[00:17:20.880 --> 00:17:21.880]   No.
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:25.080]   75 at that time was 75.
[00:17:25.080 --> 00:17:28.480]   He was already a grandpa, and so was his wife.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:32.680]   So they have been waiting and longing for a child, so when God told them that he was
[00:17:32.680 --> 00:17:35.920]   going to be a father of many nations, finally God's going to answer his prayer.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.880]   But it doesn't happen for 25 years.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.960]   So by the time God answers the prayer with Isaac, he's 100 years old.
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.840]   And that's why they laughed when God said, "I'm going to give you a child."
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:53.000]   They laughed, because they were already old at 75, and Sarah, his wife, is not much younger
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.360]   than him, and so they laughed in disbelief.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:02.320]   Even though he lived his whole life trusting in this promise, when God finally says he's
[00:18:02.320 --> 00:18:05.860]   going to fulfill it, they laughed.
[00:18:05.860 --> 00:18:08.400]   So they named their child Isaac.
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:09.400]   They laughed twice.
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:12.560]   They laughed in unbelief, and they also laughed in rejoicing.
[00:18:12.560 --> 00:18:16.160]   That's why his name is Laughter.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:20.400]   So up to that point, you can say, "Wow, God fulfilled the promise because of his faithfulness."
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:27.500]   But it is that child, it is that child of promise, God says to offer him up, sacrifice
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:29.160]   him.
[00:18:29.160 --> 00:18:36.800]   By the time he asked him to do that in Genesis chapter 12, Abraham's faith in God had grown.
[00:18:36.800 --> 00:18:41.120]   It wasn't just, "Well, you said it, so we're going to give you a chance."
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:43.160]   By the time he makes that promise, he doesn't ask.
[00:18:43.160 --> 00:18:44.800]   He's not wrestling with God.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:48.280]   He actually packs up his bag, takes Isaac up to the hill.
[00:18:48.280 --> 00:18:49.280]   Isaac asks him, "What's going on?"
[00:18:49.280 --> 00:18:51.400]   He said, "Well, God said we're going to do this."
[00:18:51.400 --> 00:18:55.640]   As he is bringing the knife down, he is stopped.
[00:18:55.640 --> 00:18:59.800]   And then because of his act, and again, as he promised, he says, "It's a fulfillment,
[00:18:59.800 --> 00:19:02.960]   it's a type of what was going to happen with his son, Jesus Christ, that he was going to
[00:19:02.960 --> 00:19:05.480]   offer up his own son instead of Isaac."
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:11.520]   And it is in that context where God responds to Abraham's faith, and he says in Genesis
[00:19:11.520 --> 00:19:15.720]   22, 16, "By myself I have sworn."
[00:19:15.720 --> 00:19:19.760]   Again, he's referring to that covenant in Genesis chapter 15.
[00:19:19.760 --> 00:19:24.000]   "By myself I have sworn," declares the Lord, "because you have done this thing and have
[00:19:24.000 --> 00:19:26.400]   not withheld your son, your only son.
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:30.800]   Indeed, I will greatly bless you and I will greatly multiply your seed as the stars of
[00:19:30.800 --> 00:19:36.000]   the heavens and as the sand which is on the seashore, and your seed shall possess the
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.760]   gate of their enemies."
[00:19:38.760 --> 00:19:43.640]   Now, did God make this promise because Abraham was faithful?
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:47.000]   No, he already made this promise.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:48.960]   It's spelled out in Genesis chapter 12.
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:51.400]   He ratifies this in Genesis chapter 15.
[00:19:51.400 --> 00:19:55.160]   But why does he say, "Because you have done this by myself I have sworn."
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:03.320]   Now, we're going to get into that because he basically is making a double promise.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:10.000]   What he has purposed, now he's making an oath to guarantee, just in case you had any doubt
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.240]   of who God is, he's guaranteeing it.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.600]   Now we don't know what Abraham was thinking at this time.
[00:20:16.600 --> 00:20:18.600]   We can only assume.
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:24.240]   But in Hebrews chapter 11, 17 to 19, it actually spells out what was happening with Abraham.
[00:20:24.240 --> 00:20:29.320]   Hebrews 11, 17 says, "By faith, Abraham when he was tested offered up Isaac and he who
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:34.000]   had received the promises was offered up his only begotten son.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:37.680]   It was he to whom it was said, 'In Isaac your descendants shall be called.'"
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:41.080]   Again, Abraham was fully aware.
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:44.320]   When God asked him to offer up Isaac, this makes absolutely no sense.
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:48.560]   I mean, he waited 25 years and God answers the prayer.
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.480]   Why would you ask Isaac?
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:57.040]   It made no sense because he was the promise that God said he was going to fulfill.
[00:20:57.040 --> 00:21:03.560]   But here's what it says in verse 19, "He considered that God is able to raise people even from
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:07.320]   the dead from which he also received him back as a type."
[00:21:07.320 --> 00:21:15.400]   In other words, Abraham understood that the fulfillment of the promise wasn't dependent
[00:21:15.400 --> 00:21:17.680]   upon Isaac.
[00:21:17.680 --> 00:21:20.360]   The fulfillment of the promise was God himself.
[00:21:20.360 --> 00:21:29.120]   See, the struggle with a lot of Christians is that we never move beyond the gift and
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:32.120]   we never see the giver.
[00:21:32.120 --> 00:21:35.200]   And when things don't make sense, we begin to question the giver.
[00:21:35.200 --> 00:21:36.200]   Where's my gift?
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:38.400]   How come you don't answer my prayers?
[00:21:38.400 --> 00:21:43.000]   There's certain things and certain places and certain circumstances God places us in
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:46.140]   and takes us through which doesn't make any sense.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:47.720]   And we're always dependent on the gift.
[00:21:47.720 --> 00:21:48.720]   Where is Isaac?
[00:21:48.720 --> 00:21:51.920]   Why would you tell us to give up Isaac?
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:58.000]   But Abraham knew by this time after everything that he's seen that the assurance of God's
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:03.800]   promise wasn't on Isaac, but it was God himself.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:09.160]   That's why it says in Hebrews 11, verse 6, "And without faith, it is impossible to please
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:10.160]   him."
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:17.000]   The reason why it's impossible to please him is because it's faith that anchors us to Christ.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.880]   And if we're not anchored to Christ in our faith, our worship, it changes based upon
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:25.000]   our situation.
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:28.640]   So when God answers our prayer and we get a great job, I want to worship him.
[00:22:28.640 --> 00:22:33.200]   When we get a difficult circumstance and we don't get the raise, we don't get the things
[00:22:33.200 --> 00:22:38.140]   that we want or we get sick, all of a sudden, where is God?
[00:22:38.140 --> 00:22:40.120]   And we stop worshipping him.
[00:22:40.120 --> 00:22:45.320]   So when he says, "Without faith, it is impossible to please him," because it is only by faith
[00:22:45.320 --> 00:22:47.960]   that we are anchored to Christ.
[00:22:47.960 --> 00:22:53.480]   For he who comes to God must believe that he is, that he is a rewarder of those who
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:55.640]   seek him.
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:01.160]   Jesus isn't just the giver, he is the gift.
[00:23:01.160 --> 00:23:04.440]   He's not the vehicle that we ride to get to the destination.
[00:23:04.440 --> 00:23:06.440]   Jesus himself is the destination.
[00:23:06.440 --> 00:23:11.280]   That's what he means when he says, "I am the way, I am the truth, I am the life.
[00:23:11.280 --> 00:23:12.840]   I am the vine.
[00:23:12.840 --> 00:23:14.360]   I am the bread.
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:15.960]   I am the living water.
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:18.600]   I am the good shepherd."
[00:23:18.600 --> 00:23:23.760]   And so all the "I am" statements is to teach the nation of Israel and all of mankind that
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:27.280]   he didn't just come to give the gift, but he himself is the gift.
[00:23:27.280 --> 00:23:34.520]   And that's what Abraham knew when God asked Isaac to be sacrificed, that even in sacrificing
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:41.400]   Isaac, as long as he had God, he was good.
[00:23:41.400 --> 00:23:48.860]   You know, when I was a younger believer, when I was 18, 19, I couldn't get this thought
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.640]   out of my head because the Bible says that the greatest commandment in the Bible is to
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.060]   love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:23:59.500]   And then second is like it, love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:23:59.500 --> 00:24:07.520]   And I couldn't shake that because I can honestly confess that I admired Jesus, that I appreciated
[00:24:07.520 --> 00:24:08.520]   Jesus.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.640]   I can say I even worshiped Jesus.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:13.360]   I can say I'm doing my best to obey Jesus.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:17.920]   But I couldn't say with confidence to love Jesus because I didn't know what to compare
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   that with.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.400]   Because I can say, you know, I love my mom, I love my dad, I love my brothers, I love,
[00:24:23.400 --> 00:24:25.880]   you know, some friends.
[00:24:25.880 --> 00:24:28.800]   And do I love God the way I love them?
[00:24:28.800 --> 00:24:32.080]   And I couldn't relate because it's different.
[00:24:32.080 --> 00:24:35.120]   So what does it mean to love God?
[00:24:35.120 --> 00:24:39.000]   So you know, I've had different people giving me advice saying like, "If you really want
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:42.720]   to love God, just say I love you God a hundred times.
[00:24:42.720 --> 00:24:45.040]   Maybe your brain's going to be washed and you're going to wake up from that and say,
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.040]   'Oh, I do love God.
[00:24:46.040 --> 00:24:47.200]   It worked.
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:50.920]   I did it as often as I could."
[00:24:50.920 --> 00:24:54.480]   You know, every Friday night I would go to prayer meeting and I would say that as often
[00:24:54.480 --> 00:24:59.360]   as many times as possible because the guys that I looked up to told me to do that.
[00:24:59.360 --> 00:25:02.040]   And at the end of that, I said, "Huh, that didn't work.
[00:25:02.040 --> 00:25:03.380]   It didn't work."
[00:25:03.380 --> 00:25:07.660]   And then I would hear people telling me, "Well, it's not how you feel.
[00:25:07.660 --> 00:25:10.320]   If you really love God, just obey."
[00:25:10.320 --> 00:25:12.840]   And said, "Okay, maybe it's not about how I feel.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:16.280]   Maybe loving God just means just do whatever He tells you to do and I'm doing this."
[00:25:16.280 --> 00:25:19.200]   But then I would come across passages that you call me Lord, Lord, but your heart is
[00:25:19.200 --> 00:25:20.760]   far from me.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.520]   I see passages in Revelations where it's saying, "You're doing all these right things, but
[00:25:24.520 --> 00:25:27.200]   you have forsaken your first love."
[00:25:27.200 --> 00:25:28.680]   And so I see all these things in Scripture.
[00:25:28.680 --> 00:25:36.120]   No, He doesn't just mean to obey because worship is dependent upon my affection for Him.
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:39.340]   So if the greatest commandment is to love the Lord you got with all your soul, mind,
[00:25:39.340 --> 00:25:46.860]   and strength, and I can't say that with confidence, where do I go from here?
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:52.420]   So every opportunity I got, I prayed that, "Lord, if that's what you want, I don't know
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.900]   what that means."
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.300]   And nobody seems to have an answer.
[00:25:56.300 --> 00:25:57.380]   So every morning I would pray.
[00:25:57.380 --> 00:25:58.500]   I would do quiet time.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:25:59.500]   I pray.
[00:25:59.500 --> 00:26:00.500]   I go to closet.
[00:26:00.500 --> 00:26:03.260]   I would pray.
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:09.180]   And God answered that request in such a powerful way.
[00:26:09.180 --> 00:26:14.540]   Like to this day, to this day, everything that I preach, everything that I know, everything
[00:26:14.540 --> 00:26:19.060]   I desire from the church is related to that.
[00:26:19.060 --> 00:26:25.840]   There was a period when I was trying to really spiritually grow and separate from my non-Christian
[00:26:25.840 --> 00:26:31.980]   friends and it wasn't even my non-Christian friends, it was my Christian friends because
[00:26:31.980 --> 00:26:34.180]   they were very nominal.
[00:26:34.180 --> 00:26:35.180]   They called themselves Christian.
[00:26:35.180 --> 00:26:38.980]   They would come to Bible studies, but every time we were away from it, it had nothing
[00:26:38.980 --> 00:26:39.980]   to do with God.
[00:26:39.980 --> 00:26:42.900]   In fact, it's very discouraging.
[00:26:42.900 --> 00:26:46.500]   Sometimes if you don't talk about God with non-Christians, I mean, it's different.
[00:26:46.500 --> 00:26:51.900]   But when you're surrounded by other Christians who supposedly are running together, but all
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:55.860]   that's in the midst of conversation has nothing to do with God.
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:26:58.940]   So I really wanted to grow spiritually, so I decided, "You know what?
[00:26:58.940 --> 00:27:04.780]   I'm going to break away from that group," and I ended up being isolated.
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:08.300]   At that time, I was working as a janitor at a Hughes Aircraft.
[00:27:08.300 --> 00:27:09.540]   It used to be in Fullerton.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:13.020]   They got rid of it and made a strip mall.
[00:27:13.020 --> 00:27:17.780]   And at that time, it was that whole Fullerton area was dominated by this company, and so
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:21.020]   I got a job there working as a janitor.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.220]   You know, and all the employees, they clock out at five o'clock and they had a few people
[00:27:25.220 --> 00:27:26.300]   who worked at night shift.
[00:27:26.300 --> 00:27:30.900]   And so I was in charge of cleaning out the bungalows eight hours a day from five to two
[00:27:30.900 --> 00:27:32.800]   in the morning.
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:36.100]   And so I'm just isolated because there's nobody around.
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.260]   I'm there by myself from five to two.
[00:27:39.260 --> 00:27:42.820]   And you know, when I first started, I would go to the end of the trailers and I would
[00:27:42.820 --> 00:27:45.940]   turn on the light and have to come all the way to the back.
[00:27:45.940 --> 00:27:49.820]   But after a while, I realized that takes about 30 extra minutes to go and turn the lights
[00:27:49.820 --> 00:27:50.820]   on.
[00:27:50.820 --> 00:27:56.580]   So I spent most of the night just in a dimly lit bungalows, just vacuuming and cleaning
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:58.100]   out trash.
[00:27:58.100 --> 00:27:59.820]   And I did that for about three, four months.
[00:27:59.820 --> 00:28:03.140]   I worked at that company for about nine months, but I did that for about three, four months,
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:07.380]   and I just couldn't take it, the isolation.
[00:28:07.380 --> 00:28:14.900]   Now, that period of my life was so lonely because I started having really depressing
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:16.580]   thoughts.
[00:28:16.580 --> 00:28:18.340]   Because I was breaking away from my friends.
[00:28:18.340 --> 00:28:19.940]   I didn't live at home.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:24.620]   I was working from five to two, and I was going to school full time during the day.
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:25.620]   I tried.
[00:28:25.620 --> 00:28:29.940]   So I was getting about three, four hours of sleep, and then I'd wake up in the morning,
[00:28:29.940 --> 00:28:31.260]   I have to go to school.
[00:28:31.260 --> 00:28:36.540]   And I remember one day, I was in between class about 30, 40 minutes in between, I got so
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:40.660]   tired, and I laid on the grass where we had hundreds of students just walking by, and
[00:28:40.660 --> 00:28:42.940]   I just conked out for three hours.
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:43.940]   I never do that.
[00:28:43.940 --> 00:28:49.560]   I'm such a light sleeper, but I conked out on the grass because I was that tired.
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:56.740]   I remember having this depressing thought, if something happened to me here, if I just
[00:28:56.740 --> 00:29:03.540]   disappeared here, I wonder how long it would take before anybody notices that I'm gone.
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:06.340]   And it was such a depressing thought.
[00:29:06.340 --> 00:29:08.940]   And then I started calculating, it's like, you know what, I'll bet you it'll take about
[00:29:08.940 --> 00:29:12.220]   a month before my mom says, "Where's Peter?"
[00:29:12.220 --> 00:29:17.180]   She'd be the first one that looked for me, because I wasn't living at home at that time.
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:23.540]   And then another month goes by, my guess is she would probably ask my older brother and
[00:29:23.540 --> 00:29:26.180]   Philip to go look for me.
[00:29:26.180 --> 00:29:29.060]   And then it would take probably another few weeks to see what happened.
[00:29:29.060 --> 00:29:35.100]   And so in my mind, it would take about three months before somebody comes and says, "Hey,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:36.100]   something happened."
[00:29:36.100 --> 00:29:40.340]   And that thought was so depressing.
[00:29:40.340 --> 00:29:45.740]   And I remember being so isolated that the thoughts that I had, it sounded like audible
[00:29:45.740 --> 00:29:47.860]   voices, I was going crazy.
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:51.860]   And I remember one time I was throwing the trash out, and I started having those thoughts,
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:53.700]   like, "What are you going to do after this?"
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:55.940]   And I said, "Nothing."
[00:29:55.940 --> 00:29:59.060]   And I said it out loud.
[00:29:59.060 --> 00:30:01.100]   Because it sounded so clear.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:02.100]   "Nothing."
[00:30:02.100 --> 00:30:03.780]   I was like, "What are you doing, Peter?"
[00:30:03.780 --> 00:30:08.580]   This is how people go crazy.
[00:30:08.580 --> 00:30:18.100]   But during that period, I started to think, even the person who probably would miss me
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:23.020]   the most, which at that time would have been my mom, it would have taken her a bit of time,
[00:30:23.020 --> 00:30:26.260]   and then my brothers to come and look for me.
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:31.900]   But immediately, I knew that God was there.
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:35.580]   Even before anything happens, God knew I was there.
[00:30:35.580 --> 00:30:38.340]   And so God became so real and intimate to me.
[00:30:38.340 --> 00:30:39.700]   And it wasn't because of anything I did.
[00:30:39.700 --> 00:30:43.980]   It was just my realization of His grace in my life.
[00:30:43.980 --> 00:30:47.820]   And so my affection for Him started to grow during that period.
[00:30:47.820 --> 00:30:53.380]   And to be honest, to be able to say, "I love you," and to mean it from the bottom of my
[00:30:53.380 --> 00:30:59.540]   heart, that He means more to me than anything that I've ever had or experienced in my life,
[00:30:59.540 --> 00:31:02.340]   even to this day.
[00:31:02.340 --> 00:31:07.200]   And so that's the foundation to me in what I desire from our church.
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:14.400]   Because without that, you can run and give your body to be burned, speak tongues of men
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:16.660]   and of angels.
[00:31:16.660 --> 00:31:18.900]   If I have not love, it means nothing.
[00:31:18.900 --> 00:31:20.860]   Because God said, that's the greatest command.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.220]   That's what He desires more than anything else.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:33.180]   He says there's two reasons why we can put our confidence in Him.
[00:31:33.180 --> 00:31:39.420]   One, His unchangeableness of His purpose in Hebrews chapter 6, 17.
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:42.220]   Interposed with an oath, just like He did with Abraham.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:46.940]   God made His covenant with Abraham, but because of His faithfulness, He made an oath to him.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:48.280]   I will do this.
[00:31:48.280 --> 00:31:51.380]   It was a double whammy, just in case one wasn't enough.
[00:31:51.380 --> 00:31:56.620]   He wanted to make sure that Abraham understood that God is not going to change his mind.
[00:31:56.620 --> 00:32:00.900]   That He not only doesn't say He's not going to do it, He says it's impossible for him
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:01.900]   to lie.
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.440]   It is impossible for him to change his mind.
[00:32:05.440 --> 00:32:08.460]   He cannot change his purpose.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:13.160]   Think about how easily and how quickly you and I change our mind.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:17.660]   When you were in high school, you probably had liked certain type of girls.
[00:32:17.660 --> 00:32:21.840]   Now you're in college, is that the same?
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:24.420]   Some of you say yes, some of you will say no.
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.620]   Some of you love computers in high school but hate it now.
[00:32:28.620 --> 00:32:32.020]   Some of you came in thinking you're going to be one major and then you switch and then
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:35.600]   you're probably not the last time you're going to switch either.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.260]   How easily we change.
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:41.860]   Those of you who graduate and you start working, you had all these things that you wanted to
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:46.300]   accomplish, you start working and all of a sudden, your values change, the way you look
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.620]   at money change, your society changes.
[00:32:49.620 --> 00:32:52.980]   You get married and have a wife, your paradigm about the world changes.
[00:32:52.980 --> 00:32:56.980]   Then you have a kid, that rocks your world and all of a sudden you change over and over
[00:32:56.980 --> 00:32:59.280]   again all throughout life.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:04.540]   What doesn't change is our constant change.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.860]   But he says God does not change.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:09.180]   He is immutable.
[00:33:09.180 --> 00:33:12.220]   In Malachi 3.6 it says, "For I, the Lord, do not change.
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:15.540]   Therefore you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed."
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:20.380]   The reason why you and I are here is because God does not change.
[00:33:20.380 --> 00:33:21.740]   He made a promise.
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:23.660]   He made a covenant.
[00:33:23.660 --> 00:33:29.300]   He knew that if that covenant, if his desire to save the world was dependent upon Abraham,
[00:33:29.300 --> 00:33:31.660]   he knew we wouldn't make it.
[00:33:31.660 --> 00:33:35.180]   Abraham would have failed during his lifetime and every single one of his children would
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:38.140]   have failed during their lifetime.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   Abraham would have failed.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:40.140]   David would have failed.
[00:33:40.140 --> 00:33:41.700]   All the prophets would have failed.
[00:33:41.700 --> 00:33:47.780]   Jesus' disciples, every single one of them, not would have failed, failed.
[00:33:47.780 --> 00:33:52.340]   So when God decided to leave his great commission, he didn't leave it to them.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.820]   He left it to the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:59.620]   When the Holy Spirit comes, you will receive power because it wasn't in them.
[00:33:59.620 --> 00:34:07.340]   The only reason why you and I are here today is because God made a promise.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.220]   After he wiped out the world, he said, "I'm not going to do this again."
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:16.620]   And he gave the rainbow as a covenant, as a symbol that he's not going to do this again.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:21.260]   And the reason why you and I have not been wiped out repeatedly over and over and over
[00:34:21.260 --> 00:34:25.620]   again is because God does not change.
[00:34:25.620 --> 00:34:28.320]   And that's what he was trying to teach.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:29.320]   God does not change.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.300]   And that's why you need to be anchored to him because God does not move.
[00:34:32.300 --> 00:34:38.620]   Hebrews chapter 13, verse 8, "Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever."
[00:34:38.620 --> 00:34:42.260]   That God who is immutable is the same Jesus that we worship.
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:47.780]   Romans 11, 29, "For the gifts and the calling of God are irrevocable."
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:52.740]   And so the reason why he's saying all of this is that everything else that you anchor yourself
[00:34:52.740 --> 00:35:00.620]   to, everything else that you anchor yourself to, to your friends, to your circumstance,
[00:35:00.620 --> 00:35:04.060]   to your education, to your bank account, it will change.
[00:35:04.060 --> 00:35:06.460]   It will move.
[00:35:06.460 --> 00:35:08.460]   The only thing that does not change is God himself.
[00:35:08.460 --> 00:35:15.120]   In Revelation 1, 8, the book of Revelation begins by saying that he is the Alpha, Omega.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:21.540]   And then it ends in Revelation 22, 13 by reminding them again that he is the Alpha and Omega.
[00:35:21.540 --> 00:35:23.340]   That he is the beginning and the end.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.620]   He's the beginning and the end.
[00:35:24.620 --> 00:35:30.980]   And everything in the middle is God-ordained and he does not change.
[00:35:30.980 --> 00:35:35.220]   All of human history is contingent upon his immutability.
[00:35:35.220 --> 00:35:40.100]   But what he has purposed, he will carry out.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:45.420]   And again, not only is his purpose not changeable, but his oath.
[00:35:45.420 --> 00:35:51.460]   I mean, it's redundant to say, "My purpose," and then, "My oath," because his purpose is
[00:35:51.460 --> 00:35:52.460]   his oath.
[00:35:52.460 --> 00:35:59.380]   But he wanted to make sure that the people who are hearing this, that he is guaranteeing.
[00:35:59.380 --> 00:36:05.140]   Whenever we buy a house or a car and you don't have enough income, you need to get a guarantor
[00:36:05.140 --> 00:36:06.140]   to sign.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:10.580]   And if you're young, you may have one of your parents do it or somebody, a close friend
[00:36:10.580 --> 00:36:12.380]   that may desire to do it.
[00:36:12.380 --> 00:36:16.080]   The guarantor cannot be a lesser of a person.
[00:36:16.080 --> 00:36:19.700]   If you're an older person, right, you're not going to ask your younger sister who's in
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.720]   high school to, "Hey, can you co-sign for me?"
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:24.620]   Because it's useless.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:26.920]   Because the guarantor has to have more money.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.620]   The guarantor has to have a better job, a good credit, to be able to come alongside
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:31.620]   and say, "You know what?
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.020]   If they default, I will take the responsibility."
[00:36:35.020 --> 00:36:39.460]   They said, "But there is no guarantor that is greater than God.
[00:36:39.460 --> 00:36:43.900]   There's nobody that can guarantee the promises and the oath that he's making that is greater
[00:36:43.900 --> 00:36:44.900]   than God."
[00:36:44.900 --> 00:36:50.500]   So because of that, he says, "By my name, by myself, I declare."
[00:36:50.500 --> 00:36:53.260]   What his purpose is, what his promise is, cannot change.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:54.260]   Numbers 23, 19.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:36:59.280]   "God is not man that he should lie, nor the son of man that he should repent.
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:05.120]   Has he said and will he not do it, or has he spoken and will he not make it good?"
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:10.840]   There are many things that the scripture promises that we can absolutely bank on.
[00:37:10.840 --> 00:37:14.840]   And one of the most important things that you and I need to believe with all our heart
[00:37:14.840 --> 00:37:21.400]   and anchor ourself to is that if you confess your sins, that he is faithful and just to
[00:37:21.400 --> 00:37:24.720]   forgive you of all your unrighteousness.
[00:37:24.720 --> 00:37:31.320]   And as fundamental as that truth is, as foundational as that truth is, you wouldn't be a Christian
[00:37:31.320 --> 00:37:34.760]   if you didn't believe that and if you didn't practice that.
[00:37:34.760 --> 00:37:41.360]   And yet, there's something in our heart that always believes that I have to do my part.
[00:37:41.360 --> 00:37:44.560]   Some of you are sitting in here because you're struggling with the same sins over and over
[00:37:44.560 --> 00:37:46.400]   and over and over again.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:51.360]   And maybe you think that you have exhausted his grace.
[00:37:51.360 --> 00:37:55.800]   And you're trying to get your life straight before you get to God.
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.600]   But the whole reason why he came and sent his only begotten son is because he knew you
[00:37:59.600 --> 00:38:01.860]   couldn't do it.
[00:38:01.860 --> 00:38:06.360]   Think about if the covenant that God made with us, if the promise that he's given us
[00:38:06.360 --> 00:38:10.620]   for eternal life was contingent upon your goodness.
[00:38:10.620 --> 00:38:13.160]   Whether you've been a Christian for a couple months or whether you've been a Christian
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:20.660]   for dozens of years, how many of you would be here today?
[00:38:20.660 --> 00:38:24.340]   How many of you would be here be able to worship God?
[00:38:24.340 --> 00:38:29.520]   How many of you here could continue to pray and participate in the communion?
[00:38:29.520 --> 00:38:31.400]   None of us.
[00:38:31.400 --> 00:38:37.080]   I could think of dozens and dozens and dozens of times where by my own effort, I should
[00:38:37.080 --> 00:38:38.360]   have walked away.
[00:38:38.360 --> 00:38:40.920]   How dare you come to God?
[00:38:40.920 --> 00:38:43.920]   How dare you ask for forgiveness again?
[00:38:43.920 --> 00:38:48.000]   How dare you after all that God has done?
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:50.120]   He knew we could not.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:57.880]   And that's why he says, "By my name, I make a unilateral covenant that I will save you."
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:03.600]   So if you confess your sins, and that's the only contingency, if you confess your sins
[00:39:03.600 --> 00:39:08.240]   and you own up to your sins and you ask for forgiveness in faith, God will forgive you.
[00:39:08.240 --> 00:39:09.240]   How many times?
[00:39:09.240 --> 00:39:10.240]   Seven times?
[00:39:10.240 --> 00:39:11.240]   Seven times 70.
[00:39:11.240 --> 00:39:17.140]   As long as you confess that our righteousness is not based upon our own merit.
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:18.520]   You don't earn that.
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:23.200]   God gives it to us because he made that promise as long as we profess.
[00:39:23.200 --> 00:39:29.400]   But secondly, in our walk with God, not only is that important, he says, "Seek ye first
[00:39:29.400 --> 00:39:32.080]   the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:36.880]   And that is a constant challenge for us because we're wealthy.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:42.280]   If we give all that we have to God, will he really take care of us?
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:43.560]   Would he really provide for us?
[00:39:43.560 --> 00:39:46.080]   Will our children really be okay?
[00:39:46.080 --> 00:39:53.400]   So in order to hedge our bets, we give some to God and we hold on to some.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:58.560]   We hook our legs on one side and then we hook the other legs on the other side, frustrated
[00:39:58.560 --> 00:40:01.960]   on both sides.
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:05.160]   But when he says, "Seek ye first the kingdom of God and all these things shall be added
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:09.840]   unto you," it doesn't make sense to believe that God, who would send his only begotten
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:13.840]   son to die for me, would be reluctant to take care of my physical needs.
[00:40:13.840 --> 00:40:18.880]   And that's exactly what it says in Romans 8.32, "He who did not spare his own son, but
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:20.160]   delivered him for us all."
[00:40:20.160 --> 00:40:23.660]   How will he not also with him freely give us all things?
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:30.160]   It just doesn't make sense to confess that Jesus died for my sins, that he gave his only
[00:40:30.160 --> 00:40:36.800]   begotten son, and then to have such a hard time believing in the trivial things.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:46.320]   If I gave you my son, you can bank that whatever else that I have would be much easier to give
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:47.320]   to you.
[00:40:47.320 --> 00:40:54.760]   And that's exactly what he is saying, that he made this promise and that is his purpose.
[00:40:54.760 --> 00:40:55.760]   And you can bank on it.
[00:40:55.760 --> 00:41:01.960]   In 2 Corinthians 1.24, "For as many as are the promises of God, in him they are yes.
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:06.160]   Therefore also through him is our amen to the glory of God through us.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:07.160]   They are yes."
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:09.400]   Whatever God has promised, it is yes.
[00:41:09.400 --> 00:41:11.040]   It's like it's already happened.
[00:41:11.040 --> 00:41:16.960]   Because God is not man that he should lie, nor the Son of Man that he should repent.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:20.440]   Has he not said and will he not do it?
[00:41:20.440 --> 00:41:21.840]   Do you believe this?
[00:41:21.840 --> 00:41:27.680]   So the two implications of knowing his nature, that he cannot lie about his purpose and he
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:35.080]   cannot lie about his oath, the two implications is that we can take refuge in him, in Hebrews
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:39.240]   6.18, so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we
[00:41:39.240 --> 00:41:45.320]   who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement to take hold of the hope set before us.
[00:41:45.320 --> 00:41:50.640]   So that two things that we are challenged to do is to take refuge and to take hope.
[00:41:50.640 --> 00:41:53.440]   To take refuge and to take hope.
[00:41:53.440 --> 00:41:56.640]   Now the word refuge.
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:42:04.720]   Refuge is a place we go to for safety when there's storm, when there's fire, when there's
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:05.720]   danger.
[00:42:05.720 --> 00:42:07.880]   So we run for safety.
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:11.520]   That's what we call place of refuge.
[00:42:11.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   Doesn't have to be a place.
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:14.520]   It could be a person.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:18.200]   If you're a child and danger comes, what do you tell the child to do?
[00:42:18.200 --> 00:42:21.680]   Look for your parents because that's their refuge.
[00:42:21.680 --> 00:42:26.960]   It could be a place, but it's a place of safety.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:32.640]   Refuge is where you come to hide from trouble.
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:36.640]   Refuge is where we run to to find help.
[00:42:36.640 --> 00:42:42.640]   So he says, if you believe that God is faithful to his promise and he cannot lie about his
[00:42:42.640 --> 00:42:46.980]   oath, he says we are called to take refuge in Psalm 46.1-3.
[00:42:46.980 --> 00:42:50.480]   God is our refuge and strength, a very present help in trouble.
[00:42:50.480 --> 00:42:54.920]   Therefore, we will not fear, though the earth should change and though the mountains slip
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:59.520]   into the heart of sea, though its waters roar and foam, though the mountains quake at its
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:02.880]   swelling pride.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:08.480]   Everybody knows to thank God in times of goodness.
[00:43:08.480 --> 00:43:18.560]   You know, even gangster rappers, when they win the Grammy, thank you, Jesus.
[00:43:18.560 --> 00:43:22.720]   Even people who deny Christ in every which way of their life, they win the lottery.
[00:43:22.720 --> 00:43:23.820]   Thank you.
[00:43:23.820 --> 00:43:26.800]   Thank you, God.
[00:43:26.800 --> 00:43:33.680]   Any of those who is anchored in Christ knows how to give praise to him in the context of
[00:43:33.680 --> 00:43:36.560]   trouble.
[00:43:36.560 --> 00:43:38.000]   I want to share this song with you.
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.560]   This is a song that I've searched for years.
[00:43:41.560 --> 00:43:44.120]   My guess is most of you probably have never heard of it.
[00:43:44.120 --> 00:43:46.600]   Do you know who Twila Paris is?
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:52.920]   Those of you nodding your head, I know your age.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.440]   It was a popular song back in the '80s, you know, and maybe early '90s.
[00:43:57.440 --> 00:44:01.280]   And I realized why I had such a hard time finding this song, because I thought Amy Grant
[00:44:01.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   sang it.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:06.220]   So I would always Google Amy Grant, and then whatever, and it never came out.
[00:44:06.220 --> 00:44:08.800]   And so I remember a couple of verses, and so I typed it in.
[00:44:08.800 --> 00:44:12.120]   So I've been looking for this song for years.
[00:44:12.120 --> 00:44:14.160]   For some reason, I found it this week.
[00:44:14.160 --> 00:44:17.320]   It wasn't by Amy Grant, but Twila Paris sang it.
[00:44:17.320 --> 00:44:20.920]   And then Gary Valenciano was the one who wrote it.
[00:44:20.920 --> 00:44:23.880]   The title of the song is "Warrior is a Child."
[00:44:23.880 --> 00:44:30.680]   And the reason why I want to introduce this to you is because the lyrics to me is so powerful.
[00:44:30.680 --> 00:44:33.000]   And maybe some of you guys can relate.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:39.520]   Lately, I've been winning battles left to right, but even winners can get wounded in
[00:44:39.520 --> 00:44:41.240]   the fight.
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:46.880]   People say that I'm amazing, I'm strong beyond my years, but they don't see inside of me,
[00:44:46.880 --> 00:44:49.680]   I'm hiding all the tears.
[00:44:49.680 --> 00:44:53.720]   They don't know that I come running home when I fall down.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:44:57.400]   They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[00:44:57.400 --> 00:45:03.140]   I drop my sword and cry for just a while, 'cause deep inside this armor, the warrior
[00:45:03.140 --> 00:45:05.520]   is a child.
[00:45:05.520 --> 00:45:12.460]   Unafraid because his armor is the best, but even soldiers need a quiet place to rest.
[00:45:12.460 --> 00:45:17.700]   People say that I'm amazing, I never face retreat, but they don't see the enemies that
[00:45:17.700 --> 00:45:20.520]   lay me at his feet.
[00:45:20.520 --> 00:45:24.400]   They don't know that I come running home when I fall down.
[00:45:24.400 --> 00:45:27.800]   They don't know who picks me up when no one is around.
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:33.520]   I drop my sword and cry for just a while, 'cause deep inside this armor, the warrior
[00:45:33.520 --> 00:45:36.360]   is a child.
[00:45:36.360 --> 00:45:39.680]   Can you relate?
[00:45:39.680 --> 00:45:47.680]   I think this song really captures what it means to have Christ as our refuge.
[00:45:47.680 --> 00:45:52.500]   Everything around us tells us to soldier up.
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:58.380]   My children know one of my favorite things that I say is suck it up.
[00:45:58.380 --> 00:45:59.380]   Suck it up.
[00:45:59.380 --> 00:46:00.460]   Life is hard.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:04.060]   I don't want you to be a snowflake.
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:06.060]   Suck it up and keep going.
[00:46:06.060 --> 00:46:07.060]   Soldier on.
[00:46:07.060 --> 00:46:10.380]   'Cause no one's gonna hold your hand.
[00:46:10.380 --> 00:46:11.700]   No one's gonna sympathize.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:15.420]   Don't wait for somebody else to fix your problem.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:20.840]   Suck it up and keep going, because that's the world that you live in.
[00:46:20.840 --> 00:46:23.780]   But that is not the God that we serve.
[00:46:23.780 --> 00:46:31.080]   In every other human relationship, don't wait for a handout.
[00:46:31.080 --> 00:46:34.040]   Don't wait for somebody to come running.
[00:46:34.040 --> 00:46:37.900]   Don't constantly search for somebody to lean on.
[00:46:37.900 --> 00:46:40.140]   Because they will disappoint you.
[00:46:40.140 --> 00:46:41.140]   Sometimes they're there.
[00:46:41.820 --> 00:46:45.460]   A lot of times they're not.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:54.820]   But the God that you and I serve, his purpose, his promise is unchangeable, and he cannot
[00:46:54.820 --> 00:46:56.820]   lie.
[00:46:56.820 --> 00:47:04.860]   The reason why we can bank on him is because he is the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:10.820]   You know, the reason why we anchor is because we found a place that we need to be.
[00:47:10.820 --> 00:47:13.300]   And we don't want to drift.
[00:47:13.300 --> 00:47:14.760]   And so we don't want to move.
[00:47:14.760 --> 00:47:15.760]   That's why we anchor.
[00:47:15.760 --> 00:47:17.580]   You don't just anchor anywhere.
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:20.660]   And that's why we're challenged to anchor in Christ.
[00:47:20.660 --> 00:47:24.140]   Because we found Christ to be our refuge.
[00:47:24.140 --> 00:47:26.500]   We found that he is our hope.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:30.020]   And that's why we need to anchor.
[00:47:30.020 --> 00:47:35.020]   In Matthew 12, 20 to 21, it says, "A battered reed he will not break off.
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:38.700]   A smoldering wick he will not put out.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:43.340]   Until he leads justice to victory, and in his name the Gentiles will hope."
[00:47:43.340 --> 00:47:50.460]   How often have you felt like a battered reed, just about to break?
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:58.100]   How often have you felt like smoldering wick, a little bit of wind, a little bit more, and
[00:47:58.100 --> 00:48:01.420]   it would have been enough to squash you.
[00:48:01.420 --> 00:48:06.460]   And yet he says in his gentle voice, "A battered reed he will not break off.
[00:48:06.460 --> 00:48:10.180]   And a smoldering wick he will not put out."
[00:48:10.180 --> 00:48:13.500]   And he invites us to him.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.380]   To trust him.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:18.100]   To take hold of this hope.
[00:48:18.100 --> 00:48:19.300]   To take hold of it.
[00:48:19.300 --> 00:48:20.300]   To anchor.
[00:48:20.300 --> 00:48:24.020]   To put your anchor down in him.
[00:48:24.020 --> 00:48:31.500]   Because when Christ is not enough, everything else will mean too much.
[00:48:31.500 --> 00:48:33.460]   Let me say that again.
[00:48:33.460 --> 00:48:40.340]   When Christ is not enough, everything else will become too much.
[00:48:40.340 --> 00:48:50.180]   So as I enter into sabbatical, that's my goal.
[00:48:50.180 --> 00:49:00.700]   I remember years ago, the only worthwhile possession I had was my Hyundai XL, which
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.260]   was a cheap car when it first came out.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:07.740]   The Hyundai's gotten better since then, but I remember I cracked the engine because I
[00:49:07.740 --> 00:49:10.460]   didn't put enough oil in there, and the engine was ruined.
[00:49:10.460 --> 00:49:17.340]   So I took it in, and the mechanic said, "I have good news and bad news.
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:18.620]   Good news, your engine's cracked.
[00:49:18.620 --> 00:49:19.620]   You need to replace it."
[00:49:19.620 --> 00:49:21.620]   Did I say that's a good news?
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:24.020]   No, that's a bad news.
[00:49:24.020 --> 00:49:25.740]   But the good news is, is the Hyundai XL.
[00:49:25.740 --> 00:49:28.980]   So I can get a brand new engine for 500 bucks.
[00:49:28.980 --> 00:49:30.460]   So many of them were junked.
[00:49:30.460 --> 00:49:33.100]   So I said, "I'll have to go to the junkyard and get one put it in."
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.620]   So he put it in for me for about five, $600.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:41.820]   I remember that I was driving that Hyundai XL, and in the parking lot, I was just kind
[00:49:41.820 --> 00:49:44.420]   of like messing around, and I hit the pole.
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.340]   It had like huge cement in the bottom, and I was driving too hard, and I didn't see it
[00:49:48.340 --> 00:49:51.340]   because it was low, and I just smashed it.
[00:49:51.340 --> 00:49:55.900]   And the whole side and the bottom part, and it bent the frame.
[00:49:55.900 --> 00:50:00.700]   So I took it in, and he said, "Oh, you really jacked this up."
[00:50:00.700 --> 00:50:03.660]   And he said, "They're going to have to use crane to bring it back.
[00:50:03.660 --> 00:50:04.940]   It's going to cost this kind of money.
[00:50:04.940 --> 00:50:06.740]   Do you want to junk it?"
[00:50:06.740 --> 00:50:15.720]   And I remember coming home from that feeling so free because that's the only thing I owned.
[00:50:15.720 --> 00:50:18.420]   And literally, I came home with nothing.
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:21.100]   Like nothing, nothing in my pocket.
[00:50:21.100 --> 00:50:23.140]   I owned nothing.
[00:50:23.140 --> 00:50:27.660]   So when he said, "Pick up your cross," I was like, "Sure.
[00:50:27.660 --> 00:50:29.340]   I got nothing to lose.
[00:50:29.340 --> 00:50:30.340]   I'm not bound by anything.
[00:50:30.340 --> 00:50:31.660]   I don't belong to any community.
[00:50:31.660 --> 00:50:33.660]   I didn't have friends that I have to give up.
[00:50:33.660 --> 00:50:35.660]   I didn't have any money in my bank account.
[00:50:35.660 --> 00:50:36.660]   So pick up your cross."
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:37.660]   I was like, "Sure."
[00:50:37.660 --> 00:50:41.620]   Because it was very, very light.
[00:50:41.620 --> 00:50:54.460]   But since then, I've gotten married, had four kids, bought a house, and the church has grown,
[00:50:54.460 --> 00:51:02.100]   and had a certain kind of reputation, and have to worry about so many different things.
[00:51:02.100 --> 00:51:06.380]   And it hasn't been that simple since.
[00:51:06.380 --> 00:51:12.780]   And so I have to constantly ask myself, "Is Christ enough?
[00:51:12.780 --> 00:51:14.180]   Is Christ enough?
[00:51:14.180 --> 00:51:16.560]   What's driving you?
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:18.620]   What's driving me?
[00:51:18.620 --> 00:51:21.380]   Why do you do what you do?"
[00:51:21.380 --> 00:51:24.860]   If God took away everything, would you still love him?
[00:51:24.860 --> 00:51:27.460]   Would you still follow him?
[00:51:27.460 --> 00:51:30.260]   Would you still proclaim him?
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:35.580]   And my honest confession is, it hasn't been that simple since then.
[00:51:35.580 --> 00:51:40.340]   Every good gift that he has given to me has become something that I had to give back,
[00:51:40.340 --> 00:51:44.620]   at least in my heart.
[00:51:44.620 --> 00:51:51.060]   My prayer for us is stated really in Habakkuk 3, 17 to 18.
[00:51:51.060 --> 00:51:55.660]   I think Elder James really loves this verse because I remember him quoting this a lot.
[00:51:55.660 --> 00:52:02.780]   "Though the fig tree should not blossom and there be no fruit on the vines, though the
[00:52:02.780 --> 00:52:08.180]   yield of the olive should fail and the fields produce no food, though the flock should be
[00:52:08.180 --> 00:52:14.100]   cut off from the fold and there be no cattle in the stalls, yet I will exalt in the Lord.
[00:52:14.100 --> 00:52:19.420]   I will rejoice in the God of my salvation."
[00:52:19.420 --> 00:52:22.740]   Isaac is not the fulfillment of our promise.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:30.340]   My wife, my kids, this church, it's not the fulfillment of God's promise.
[00:52:30.340 --> 00:52:33.020]   It's God.
[00:52:33.020 --> 00:52:39.220]   And my desire is, for our church, is that not that we become the biggest church in Orange
[00:52:39.220 --> 00:52:44.900]   County, that we would have the most influence, that we would be filled with people who are
[00:52:44.900 --> 00:52:48.140]   the experts in theology.
[00:52:48.140 --> 00:52:53.780]   It's hyper-organized, run like a well-oiled machine, that this is the place you come if
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:57.260]   you want to study the Bible.
[00:52:57.260 --> 00:52:59.260]   All of these things are great things.
[00:52:59.260 --> 00:53:04.860]   But what God wants more than anything else are people who will worship Him in spirit
[00:53:04.860 --> 00:53:07.180]   and in truth.
[00:53:07.180 --> 00:53:10.380]   And you can't do that if you love Him, if you don't love Him with all your heart, soul,
[00:53:10.380 --> 00:53:12.620]   mind, and strength.
[00:53:12.620 --> 00:53:23.880]   So my desire for us, as I go into my sabbatical, is that we would learn to love God.
[00:53:23.880 --> 00:53:27.860]   Not to be a good student alone, not to be a good businessman, not to be a good child
[00:53:27.860 --> 00:53:29.940]   or mother or father.
[00:53:29.940 --> 00:53:35.020]   Above all of that, to be anchored in Christ.
[00:53:35.020 --> 00:53:41.860]   And I know, I know that you know what I'm talking about, how easily we can be distracted,
[00:53:41.860 --> 00:53:48.780]   how easily we can fool ourselves, how easily we can love the gift more than the giver.
[00:53:48.780 --> 00:53:56.340]   Why we need to take a step back and anchor ourselves to Christ.
[00:53:56.340 --> 00:54:00.420]   Let me wrap up with this, and I'm going to ask the praise team to come up.
[00:54:00.420 --> 00:54:05.180]   And I want to sing this song with you, this hymn, "My Hope is Built on Nothing Less."
[00:54:05.180 --> 00:54:09.060]   And this is a hymn that we sing quite often at our church, but my prayer is that as we
[00:54:09.060 --> 00:54:14.460]   sing it, that we would make this our prayer and our honest confession.
[00:54:14.460 --> 00:54:19.940]   My hope is built on nothing less than Jesus Christ, my righteousness.
[00:54:19.940 --> 00:54:24.780]   I dare not trust the sweetest frame, but wholly lean on Jesus' name.
[00:54:24.780 --> 00:54:31.020]   On Christ, the solid rock I stand, all other ground is sinking sand, all other ground is
[00:54:31.020 --> 00:54:33.220]   sinking sand.
[00:54:33.220 --> 00:54:37.700]   When darkness veils His lovely face, I rest on His unchanging grace.
[00:54:37.700 --> 00:54:45.460]   In every high and stormy gale, my anchor holds within the veil His covenant, His blood.
[00:54:45.460 --> 00:54:49.460]   Support me in the whelming flood, when all around my soul gives way, He then is all my
[00:54:49.460 --> 00:54:51.860]   hope and stay.
[00:54:51.860 --> 00:55:04.820]   Father, I pray that the words of this song would be our honest confession.
[00:55:04.820 --> 00:55:12.080]   Help us, Lord God, to realize that we cannot serve mammon and God.
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:16.980]   Help us to know the surpassing knowledge of knowing Christ, that all the temptations in
[00:55:16.980 --> 00:55:21.500]   our world would truly become rubbish.
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:30.460]   Help us to bank and to invest and to take refuge and hope in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:55:30.460 --> 00:55:32.180]   May this song be our prayer.
[00:55:32.180 --> 00:55:32.780]   Amen.
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:41.920]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
