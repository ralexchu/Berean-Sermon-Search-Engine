[00:01:15.740 --> 00:01:20.660]   - Hello, everybody.
[00:01:20.660 --> 00:01:21.960]   Let's go ahead and get seated
[00:01:21.960 --> 00:01:24.260]   and we'll start in just 30 seconds, thanks.

[00:02:08.740 --> 00:02:11.320]   (gentle music)
[00:02:11.320 --> 00:02:33.020]   All right, everybody, let's go ahead
[00:02:33.020 --> 00:02:35.980]   and gather our thoughts and would you bow with me
[00:02:35.980 --> 00:02:38.700]   for a word of prayer as we begin our time of worship?
[00:02:38.700 --> 00:02:39.700]   Let's pray together.
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:42.380]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God,
[00:02:42.380 --> 00:02:44.420]   for your grace and mercies.
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.500]   Lord, we do recognize, God, that each time
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:50.060]   we're able to come to open up your word,
[00:02:50.060 --> 00:02:54.220]   your precious truth, and then see your instruction for us,
[00:02:54.220 --> 00:02:56.420]   see also your love for us.
[00:02:56.420 --> 00:02:58.180]   From the many saints from before,
[00:02:58.180 --> 00:02:59.780]   you have through your apostles,
[00:02:59.780 --> 00:03:02.880]   to the privilege of laboring in the church together,
[00:03:02.880 --> 00:03:04.860]   we recognize, God, that you have exhibited
[00:03:04.860 --> 00:03:08.660]   so much care, love, provision for us.
[00:03:08.660 --> 00:03:11.420]   And so as we fellowship in Bible study,
[00:03:11.420 --> 00:03:14.940]   in worship, in prayer, we're always thankful, Lord.
[00:03:14.940 --> 00:03:17.820]   We do ask, God, that you would help us truly grow
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:21.020]   from every experience, each time invested
[00:03:21.020 --> 00:03:23.100]   to come together to the hearing,
[00:03:23.100 --> 00:03:24.760]   to the applying of your word.
[00:03:24.760 --> 00:03:26.700]   Would you provide the growth, Lord?
[00:03:26.700 --> 00:03:28.560]   We wanna thank you again for this evening.
[00:03:28.560 --> 00:03:30.740]   It's in Christ's name, amen.

[00:10:06.580 --> 00:10:12.580]   There is none like you
[00:10:13.580 --> 00:10:22.580]   I worship you, O Prince of Peace
[00:10:22.580 --> 00:10:29.580]   That is what I want to do
[00:10:29.580 --> 00:10:35.580]   I give you praise
[00:10:35.580 --> 00:10:42.580]   For you are my righteousness
[00:10:43.580 --> 00:10:54.580]   I worship you, Almighty God
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:11:01.580]   There is none like you

[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:45.580]   I give you praise
[00:11:45.580 --> 00:11:55.580]   For you are my righteousness
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:12:06.580]   I worship you, Almighty God
[00:12:06.580 --> 00:12:13.580]   There is none like you
[00:12:25.580 --> 00:12:27.580]   Okay, good evening everybody.
[00:12:27.580 --> 00:12:30.580]   I do want to highlight some important announcements.
[00:12:30.580 --> 00:12:34.580]   Because Passion Week is just around the corner,
[00:12:34.580 --> 00:12:38.580]   please do make sure that you're mindful of the calendar events.
[00:12:38.580 --> 00:12:40.580]   But one of the things I want to highlight is,
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:43.580]   those of you who are looking to volunteer,
[00:12:43.580 --> 00:12:46.580]   this is a great opportunity where we do have need for setup,
[00:12:46.580 --> 00:12:48.580]   for cleaning, for even food prep.
[00:12:48.580 --> 00:12:51.580]   We are going to be serving lunch during Easter.
[00:12:51.580 --> 00:12:55.580]   So the link to volunteer is on the app and on the website.
[00:12:55.580 --> 00:13:00.580]   So please make sure that you sign up for those volunteer opportunities.
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:04.580]   The other volunteer opportunity I want to highlight is that
[00:13:04.580 --> 00:13:09.580]   we do have the VBS volunteers enrollment right now.
[00:13:09.580 --> 00:13:13.580]   So if you are a member, please do make sure that you block off these days,
[00:13:13.580 --> 00:13:17.580]   July 10th through July 14th.
[00:13:17.580 --> 00:13:19.580]   And you can again sign up.
[00:13:19.580 --> 00:13:22.580]   Jim is there in the back. He's been walking around. He's waving.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:24.580]   But he's been walking around with the sign up sheet.
[00:13:24.580 --> 00:13:27.580]   And also the sign up link is online.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:29.580]   The other thing I wanted to mention is that
[00:13:29.580 --> 00:13:33.580]   there is a softball tournament that's going to be scheduled for May 20th.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:38.580]   There is both a ladies softball program and also the men's.
[00:13:38.580 --> 00:13:40.580]   So you can look at the information online
[00:13:40.580 --> 00:13:42.580]   and all the proceeds from that tournament
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:45.580]   will go towards the summer missions efforts.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:48.580]   And the last thing I just want to mention is for tonight,
[00:13:48.580 --> 00:13:50.580]   as usual in our discussion groups,
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:54.580]   we will be doing the observation and applications and discussion.
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:58.580]   But we also have a few questions that Pastor Peter Chong gave to us
[00:13:58.580 --> 00:14:00.580]   that you can include into your discussion.
[00:14:00.580 --> 00:14:02.580]   The three are here.
[00:14:02.580 --> 00:14:04.580]   So for those of you guys who are going into the rooms,
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:06.580]   you can take a quick snapshot.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.580]   But it says, "What does walking in truth entail?
[00:14:08.580 --> 00:14:10.580]   What exactly is hospitality?
[00:14:10.580 --> 00:14:14.580]   How is hospitality related to sending out of gospel workers?
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:17.580]   And what does it mean to do something for the sake of the name?"
[00:14:17.580 --> 00:14:20.580]   So please make sure you include some of those observation questions.
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.580]   We'll see you guys back at 8.

[00:59:16.580 --> 00:59:19.580]   Kevin Yoon, can you hear me? Oh, whoa. Ah, ah.
[00:59:19.580 --> 00:59:29.580]   All right, if you guys can just pray with me real quick for our wrap-up time.
[00:59:29.580 --> 00:59:43.580]   Father, a lot of times it's easy to just get lost in the details and forget the main point.
[00:59:43.580 --> 00:59:51.580]   And Lord, a lot of times it can just become an academic exercise and not something that we really seek to earnestly apply in our lives.
[00:59:51.580 --> 01:00:01.580]   So we pray that as we talk about your truth, your word, that it would not become so familiar that it just becomes religious information.
[01:00:01.580 --> 01:00:08.580]   That this really would be commands that are taken as commands and not suggestions.
[01:00:08.580 --> 01:00:14.580]   Truths that we hold on to and that we mull over and that we apply into our lives.
[01:00:14.580 --> 01:00:26.580]   So I pray that tonight, as we start 3rd John, that you would cause us to chew, digest, and process appropriately for your glory.
[01:00:26.580 --> 01:00:32.580]   And would you bear fruit in our time together. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:00:32.580 --> 01:00:36.580]   So, I have three main people in 3rd John.
[01:00:36.580 --> 01:00:40.580]   The whole letter revolves around three individuals.
[01:00:40.580 --> 01:00:44.580]   You have the Apostle John, he's the author.
[01:00:44.580 --> 01:00:49.580]   And then you have Diatrephes, he's the church's headache.
[01:00:49.580 --> 01:00:55.580]   I call him the headache because he's just giving everybody a headache, he's kicking people out.
[01:00:55.580 --> 01:01:01.580]   Are there instances where you are supposed to kick somebody out of a church?
[01:01:01.580 --> 01:01:03.580]   It's a biblical precedent, yes.
[01:01:03.580 --> 01:01:12.580]   But Diatrephes, he's just taking it upon himself and unilaterally discarding whoever is basically insubordinate.
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:19.580]   So he's a headache and Demetrius is likely the one who's brought the letter to Gaius.
[01:01:19.580 --> 01:01:25.580]   And that's why there's almost like a commendation for Demetrius as well.
[01:01:25.580 --> 01:01:31.580]   And who knows, maybe Demetrius is someone who's gone out for the sake of the name.
[01:01:31.580 --> 01:01:40.580]   So there are three individuals that the letter revolves around.
[01:01:40.580 --> 01:01:48.580]   And so now that 2nd John is kind of in your heads and we've now gone to 3rd John, I want to do a quick review.
[01:01:48.580 --> 01:01:50.580]   And these are called the twin epistles.
[01:01:50.580 --> 01:01:55.580]   A lot of people like to call them the twin epistles because you're actually supposed to read them together.
[01:01:55.580 --> 01:01:58.580]   Except they're fraternal twins.
[01:01:58.580 --> 01:01:59.580]   They're not identical twins.
[01:01:59.580 --> 01:02:07.580]   Fraternal twins have enough in common, but there are slight differences in the DNA.
[01:02:07.580 --> 01:02:15.580]   So most likely 1st, 2nd, and 3rd John were all written at the same time in the same context.
[01:02:15.580 --> 01:02:18.580]   1st John just is a little lengthier.
[01:02:18.580 --> 01:02:21.580]   2nd and 3rd John, there's a lot of parallels.
[01:02:21.580 --> 01:02:28.580]   And coincidentally, if you guys want some Bible trivia, 3rd John is the shortest book in the whole Bible.
[01:02:28.580 --> 01:02:32.580]   It's the shortest book.
[01:02:32.580 --> 01:02:34.580]   I almost fell back.
[01:02:34.580 --> 01:02:36.580]   I got too excited.
[01:02:36.580 --> 01:02:38.580]   So there's a lot of parallels here.
[01:02:38.580 --> 01:02:44.580]   You've got the elder writing to someone or people that he loves.
[01:02:44.580 --> 01:02:49.580]   And he loves them in the truth.
[01:02:49.580 --> 01:02:54.580]   And he's so delighted that they're walking in the truth.
[01:02:54.580 --> 01:02:57.580]   And 1st John has a lot of this too.
[01:02:57.580 --> 01:02:59.580]   And he calls them all children.
[01:02:59.580 --> 01:03:01.580]   Part of it is because he's probably almost 90.
[01:03:01.580 --> 01:03:03.580]   He's an elderly man.
[01:03:03.580 --> 01:03:05.580]   So everyone's a child.
[01:03:05.580 --> 01:03:07.580]   Everybody calls him Papa John.
[01:03:07.580 --> 01:03:09.580]   So everybody is a child.
[01:03:09.580 --> 01:03:15.580]   And when his children walk in the truth, it gives him unspeakable joy.
[01:03:15.580 --> 01:03:19.580]   But we have to understand what "walk in the truth" is.
[01:03:19.580 --> 01:03:24.580]   Because that's almost like a hinge word in every single one of his epistles.
[01:03:24.580 --> 01:03:26.580]   1st John has truth.
[01:03:26.580 --> 01:03:28.580]   2nd John has "walk in the truth."
[01:03:28.580 --> 01:03:30.580]   3rd John has "walk in the truth."
[01:03:30.580 --> 01:03:32.580]   So John is made glad by this.
[01:03:32.580 --> 01:03:39.580]   2nd John, there's an exhortation to watch out for the deceivers.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:49.580]   3rd John is a commendation that Gaius is helping strangers.
[01:03:49.580 --> 01:03:56.580]   So the 1st one is, don't participate in their mission work.
[01:03:56.580 --> 01:04:02.580]   3rd John is, support this mission work.
[01:04:02.580 --> 01:04:07.580]   So then you've got a little bit of a tension in your heart.
[01:04:07.580 --> 01:04:10.580]   How do I discern which is which?
[01:04:10.580 --> 01:04:13.580]   So unlike 2nd John where there are three imperatives,
[01:04:13.580 --> 01:04:16.580]   3rd John, there's only one real application.
[01:04:16.580 --> 01:04:19.580]   And that's going to come next week.
[01:04:19.580 --> 01:04:24.580]   So this is a review slide, so you already have this in your possession.
[01:04:24.580 --> 01:04:31.580]   And then 2nd and 3rd John, he's like, "I don't want to waste papyrus. Peace out."
[01:04:31.580 --> 01:04:33.580]   He just writes really quickly.
[01:04:33.580 --> 01:04:41.580]   So like I mentioned before, 2nd John is telling you not to be hospitable and don't support an endeavor.
[01:04:41.580 --> 01:04:49.580]   3rd John is saying, do show hospitality even if they're strangers and do support their work,
[01:04:49.580 --> 01:04:55.580]   especially since they went out not receiving any help from the Gentiles, from the pagans.
[01:04:55.580 --> 01:04:59.580]   So help them because no one else is going to help them.
[01:04:59.580 --> 01:05:06.580]   So the 2nd John talks about not joining with false teachers, deceivers, antichrists, and self-centered folks.
[01:05:06.580 --> 01:05:14.580]   3rd John is talking about joining hands and partnering with real brothers and missionaries.
[01:05:14.580 --> 01:05:17.580]   Here's the challenge though.
[01:05:17.580 --> 01:05:24.580]   If someone comes into town asking for mission support,
[01:05:24.580 --> 01:05:33.580]   we are supposed to either help them or shun them based on what?
[01:05:33.580 --> 01:05:37.580]   Their allegiance to the truth.
[01:05:37.580 --> 01:05:42.580]   So then the question is, what is the truth?
[01:05:42.580 --> 01:05:50.580]   And how much truth do they need to proclaim for it to be a good truth?
[01:05:50.580 --> 01:05:55.580]   Because remember, most false doctrine is loaded with good truth.
[01:05:55.580 --> 01:05:58.580]   It's just a distortion. It's just a perversion.
[01:05:58.580 --> 01:06:00.580]   So how do we discern this?
[01:06:00.580 --> 01:06:03.580]   How did Gaius discern this and get a commendation?
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   What if Gaius held hands with a false teacher, with a deceiver, he would have received a rebuke.
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:17.580]   For the one who gives him a greeting participates in his evil work.
[01:06:17.580 --> 01:06:19.580]   That's what Gaius would have received.
[01:06:19.580 --> 01:06:21.580]   But he receives a commendation.
[01:06:21.580 --> 01:06:27.580]   And I think for me, I look at the greeting, and a lot of times we gloss over the greeting,
[01:06:27.580 --> 01:06:31.580]   but for me that greeting was very significant.
[01:06:31.580 --> 01:06:36.580]   Gaius is a man whose soul prospers.
[01:06:36.580 --> 01:06:39.580]   Did you guys notice that?
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:42.580]   I mean, John is like, he's not telling him health and wealth.
[01:06:42.580 --> 01:06:49.580]   He's like, "Your soul is prospering, and so my blessing is that everything in your life prospers, just as your soul prospers."
[01:06:49.580 --> 01:07:00.580]   And for a man whose soul is prosperous, he probably has very special insight and sensitivity to the Word of God,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:06.580]   to the will of God, to discern if these people are worth supporting, and if these people are worth rejecting.
[01:07:06.580 --> 01:07:12.580]   It's almost like a spiritual sixth sense laden with concrete, tangible truth.
[01:07:12.580 --> 01:07:22.580]   Okay? So Gaius is a man whose soul prospers in such a way that he has spiritual discernment.
[01:07:22.580 --> 01:07:25.580]   He is beyond reproach.
[01:07:25.580 --> 01:07:27.580]   He is spirit-filled.
[01:07:27.580 --> 01:07:32.580]   He watches his life and his doctrine closely, and thus God is pleased.
[01:07:32.580 --> 01:07:34.580]   He abides. He bears fruit.
[01:07:34.580 --> 01:07:40.580]   His eyes are open to discern and sniff out things that are untrue.
[01:07:40.580 --> 01:07:43.580]   Are you guys tracking?
[01:07:43.580 --> 01:07:49.580]   So he is not tossed back and forth by every kind wind of doctrine.
[01:07:49.580 --> 01:07:51.580]   He has the mind of the Spirit.
[01:07:51.580 --> 01:07:57.580]   He has the breastplate of righteousness, the helmet of salvation, and he's got the full armor of God on,
[01:07:57.580 --> 01:08:02.580]   and he can distinguish even the flaming arrows of the devil, and he is a discerning man.
[01:08:02.580 --> 01:08:06.580]   That's what it means for the soul to prosper.
[01:08:06.580 --> 01:08:12.580]   So I feel like that is a very significant description of the man Gaius
[01:08:12.580 --> 01:08:17.580]   that allows him to have insight into who to partner with and who to shun.
[01:08:17.580 --> 01:08:19.580]   Okay? So this is the passage.
[01:08:19.580 --> 01:08:22.580]   The bottom part, I'm sure for the back of you guys it might be hard to see.
[01:08:22.580 --> 01:08:25.580]   I will provide the slides for you.
[01:08:25.580 --> 01:08:30.580]   Okay? So I just do some highlighting work here.
[01:08:30.580 --> 01:08:35.580]   I notice that Gaius is called "beloved" multiple times here.
[01:08:35.580 --> 01:08:39.580]   Okay? Is that common? It's actually not.
[01:08:39.580 --> 01:08:42.580]   John doesn't just call everybody "beloved."
[01:08:42.580 --> 01:08:49.580]   But for some reason, Gaius has a special place in this man's heart.
[01:08:49.580 --> 01:08:54.580]   There's also, I think, seven mentions of "the truth."
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:57.580]   And 1 John, 2 John all have a lot of "the truth,"
[01:08:57.580 --> 01:09:06.580]   but 3 John, in this shortest book of the entire Bible, the word "the truth" is mentioned seven times.
[01:09:06.580 --> 01:09:11.580]   And for Gaius, whose soul prospers, I highlighted in yellow,
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:18.580]   what does it mean? What are the outward ramifications of a prosperous soul?
[01:09:18.580 --> 01:09:21.580]   He acts faithfully.
[01:09:21.580 --> 01:09:25.580]   He accomplishes whatever it is for the brothers.
[01:09:25.580 --> 01:09:33.580]   He has love, and he is eager to send them on their way.
[01:09:33.580 --> 01:09:38.580]   And just as a background, hospitality at this time was very important.
[01:09:38.580 --> 01:09:48.580]   Okay? And I want to just walk you through why it was important for Christians to support Christian missionaries in this period of time.
[01:09:48.580 --> 01:09:55.580]   So this is the Apostle Paul kind of just explaining what he had to undergo.
[01:09:55.580 --> 01:10:02.580]   2 Corinthians 11, 23-33, "Are they servants of Christ?"
[01:10:02.580 --> 01:10:06.580]   I speak as if in saying he's engaging in a little bit of foolishness.
[01:10:06.580 --> 01:10:09.580]   He's writing all of his accomplishments, but this is what he's saying.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:19.580]   "I more so, in far more labors, in far more imprisonments, beaten times without number, often in danger of death.
[01:10:19.580 --> 01:10:22.580]   Five times I received from the Jews 39 lashes.
[01:10:22.580 --> 01:10:25.580]   Three times I was beaten with rods.
[01:10:25.580 --> 01:10:28.580]   Once I was stoned. Three times I was shipwrecked.
[01:10:28.580 --> 01:10:31.580]   A night and a day I've spent in the deep.
[01:10:31.580 --> 01:10:38.580]   I've been on frequent journeys, in dangers from rivers, dangers from robbers, dangers from my countrymen,
[01:10:38.580 --> 01:10:47.580]   dangers from the Gentiles, dangers in the city, dangers in the wilderness, dangers on the sea, dangers amongst false brethren.
[01:10:47.580 --> 01:10:57.580]   I have been in labor and hardship through many sleepless nights, in hunger and thirst, often without food, in cold and exposure.
[01:10:57.580 --> 01:11:04.580]   Apart from such external things, there is a daily pressure on me of all the concern for all the churches.
[01:11:04.580 --> 01:11:08.580]   Who is weak without my being weak? Who is led into sin without my intense concern?
[01:11:08.580 --> 01:11:13.580]   If I have to boast, I will boast of what pertains to my weakness.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:19.580]   The God and Father of the Lord Jesus, He who is blessed forever, knows that I am not lying.
[01:11:19.580 --> 01:11:27.580]   In Damascus, the Ethnarch under Aretas the king was guarding the city of the Damascenes in order to seize me.
[01:11:27.580 --> 01:11:33.580]   And I was let down in a basket through a window in the wall, and so escaped his hands.
[01:11:33.580 --> 01:11:40.580]   Was Paul's life easy? No.
[01:11:40.580 --> 01:11:47.580]   Would the local police help him? No.
[01:11:47.580 --> 01:11:56.580]   Paul at least had some things that he could lean on, his citizenship.
[01:11:56.580 --> 01:12:06.580]   All other people who went out for the sake of the name of Jesus Christ had the exact same situation.
[01:12:06.580 --> 01:12:17.580]   So for Gaius to get these brothers who were traveling through, the love of Christ compelled him to do whatever was in his power,
[01:12:17.580 --> 01:12:28.580]   not to remove their discomfort, not to take away all of their sacrifices, but to partner with them at his expense,
[01:12:28.580 --> 01:12:34.580]   so that their mission's work would not be obstructed to the best of their ability.
[01:12:34.580 --> 01:12:40.580]   And the reason I wanted to share this is to share what kind of work Gaius was doing.
[01:12:40.580 --> 01:12:47.580]   Every missionary, everyone who went out for the sake of the name, they didn't just go empty-handed.
[01:12:47.580 --> 01:12:51.580]   They went empty-handed into warfare.
[01:12:51.580 --> 01:13:01.580]   So it was imperative for someone who claims to know the truth, when he sees a brother and sister in need, 1 John 3, 18,
[01:13:01.580 --> 01:13:07.580]   that his love is not in word or tongue only, but in actions and in truth.
[01:13:07.580 --> 01:13:10.580]   That's what it says in 1 John 3.
[01:13:10.580 --> 01:13:23.580]   So the truth of God and the love of Christ compels me to partner with these people who are giving their all
[01:13:23.580 --> 01:13:27.580]   to sacrifice whatever it is for the sake of Christ.
[01:13:27.580 --> 01:13:29.580]   That's what's happening there.
[01:13:29.580 --> 01:13:34.580]   And this was the culture, this was very common in the culture.
[01:13:34.580 --> 01:13:40.580]   The people who went out to proclaim the name of Jesus Christ underwent all of these things.
[01:13:40.580 --> 01:13:47.580]   That's why when you see the New Testament, it is rife with hospitality exhortations.
[01:13:47.580 --> 01:13:54.580]   This isn't like, our understanding of hospitality is, "Hey, let me invite you over to my house.
[01:13:54.580 --> 01:13:57.580]   Let me give you a charcuterie cart." What is that called?
[01:13:57.580 --> 01:14:00.580]   A char... "Let me make a board for you," right?
[01:14:00.580 --> 01:14:01.580]   With all kinds of stuff.
[01:14:01.580 --> 01:14:05.580]   "Hey, come over. Let me make for you kimchi fried rice. That's my specialty."
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:11.580]   "Oh, you need like, you know, you need just a place to stay for the night?"
[01:14:11.580 --> 01:14:14.580]   By all means. That's not what it's talking about.
[01:14:14.580 --> 01:14:23.580]   It is at the personal expense joining in the gospel endeavor for the sake of the name.
[01:14:23.580 --> 01:14:25.580]   That's hospitality.
[01:14:25.580 --> 01:14:29.580]   It doesn't mean just being polite as an Orange County person, inviting people into your home.
[01:14:29.580 --> 01:14:32.580]   "Oh, I did a good job. I'm so hospitable," right?
[01:14:32.580 --> 01:14:34.580]   Like, "I get kingdom points." No.
[01:14:34.580 --> 01:14:35.580]   Okay?
[01:14:35.580 --> 01:14:43.580]   So 1 Peter 4:9, "Be hospitable to one another without complaint."
[01:14:43.580 --> 01:14:49.580]   If supporting a mission's endeavor costs you a month's paycheck,
[01:14:49.580 --> 01:14:51.580]   don't grumble about that under your breath.
[01:14:51.580 --> 01:14:55.580]   Have it be a joy.
[01:14:55.580 --> 01:15:01.580]   And perhaps even if you're not... you're familiar enough with their work where you trust it,
[01:15:01.580 --> 01:15:04.580]   but even if you've never really met them before,
[01:15:04.580 --> 01:15:09.580]   do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers for by this I may have entertained angels without knowing it.
[01:15:09.580 --> 01:15:14.580]   Romans 12, 10 to 13, "Be devoted to one another in brotherly love.
[01:15:14.580 --> 01:15:20.580]   Give preference to one another in honor, lot lagging behind in diligence, fervent in spirit, serving the Lord,
[01:15:20.580 --> 01:15:25.580]   rejoicing in hope, persevering in tribulation, devoted to prayer,
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:33.580]   contributing to the needs of the saints, practicing hospitality."
[01:15:33.580 --> 01:15:44.580]   I believe that it is almost sinful to see the needs of gospel workers
[01:15:44.580 --> 01:15:50.580]   and just to say, "Be warm and well fed."
[01:15:50.580 --> 01:15:57.580]   Even at personal expense and sacrifice, we are called to partner
[01:15:57.580 --> 01:16:04.580]   because this is our labor, not just his labor.
[01:16:04.580 --> 01:16:07.580]   And that's what Gaius was doing, right?
[01:16:07.580 --> 01:16:10.580]   And there was a... they bore witness to his love.
[01:16:10.580 --> 01:16:23.580]   So what's the relationship between a prosperous soul, truth, and partnering in the gospel ministry?
[01:16:23.580 --> 01:16:27.580]   I just have a couple of final points for you.
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:35.580]   1 Timothy 4, 16, "Pay close attention to yourself," okay, watch your life,
[01:16:35.580 --> 01:16:41.580]   "and to your teaching and your doctrine. Persevere in these things, for as you do this,
[01:16:41.580 --> 01:16:48.580]   you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you."
[01:16:48.580 --> 01:16:54.580]   Gaius, he was teaching truth, if you look at verse 3, right?
[01:16:54.580 --> 01:16:58.580]   They were testifying about his truth, okay?
[01:16:58.580 --> 01:17:03.580]   And he was also practicing truth, and that was evident in even the sacrifices that he made.
[01:17:03.580 --> 01:17:06.580]   So he was watching his life and doctrine.
[01:17:06.580 --> 01:17:09.580]   Next week, we're going to look at Diatrephes.
[01:17:09.580 --> 01:17:13.580]   He turns a deaf ear to the truth.
[01:17:13.580 --> 01:17:22.580]   He distorts the truth, and then he obstructs the truth.
[01:17:22.580 --> 01:17:31.580]   So the relationship between a prosperous soul and the truth and gospel ministry,
[01:17:31.580 --> 01:17:37.580]   I hope you can kind of see, like, the connection that is there.
[01:17:37.580 --> 01:17:46.580]   So how do we discern whether someone is worth partnering with or not?
[01:17:46.580 --> 01:17:49.580]   Are they teaching in line with the truth?
[01:17:49.580 --> 01:17:52.580]   Are they practicing in line with the truth?
[01:17:52.580 --> 01:17:58.580]   Or are they people like in Titus 1, they claim to know God, but by their deeds they deny him, right?
[01:17:58.580 --> 01:18:01.580]   That they're unfit for anything good.
[01:18:01.580 --> 01:18:04.580]   So is this missionary's doctrine sound?
[01:18:04.580 --> 01:18:08.580]   Is his life sound?
[01:18:08.580 --> 01:18:12.580]   I'm going to get behind him, even if he is a stranger.
[01:18:12.580 --> 01:18:19.580]   And I will do well to send him on his way in a manner worthy of God.
[01:18:19.580 --> 01:18:27.580]   So give generously, but scrutinize those to whom you plan to give generously.
[01:18:27.580 --> 01:18:32.580]   And that's, I think, kind of the thrust of the first seven verses.
[01:18:32.580 --> 01:18:40.580]   And verse 8, I wanted to break it up there so that you see next week just the application of what we looked at this week.
[01:18:40.580 --> 01:18:42.580]   And then we're wrapping up 3 John.
[01:18:42.580 --> 01:18:44.580]   It's a very short letter.
[01:18:44.580 --> 01:18:50.580]   So next week, there is no Bible study as we have Passion Week events.
[01:18:50.580 --> 01:18:54.580]   So Monday through Wednesday we have an evening devotional.
[01:18:54.580 --> 01:18:58.580]   Thursday we have a Passover dinner, which you have to sign up for.
[01:18:58.580 --> 01:18:59.580]   Space is limited.
[01:18:59.580 --> 01:19:00.580]   It's going to be in here.
[01:19:00.580 --> 01:19:03.580]   Friday we have the Good Friday service that's open to all.
[01:19:03.580 --> 01:19:05.580]   And then that's next week during the week.
[01:19:05.580 --> 01:19:12.580]   So for Wednesday, April 12th, which is two weeks from today, we're going to be doing the last...
[01:19:12.580 --> 01:19:14.580]   It's actually verse 8 to 15.
[01:19:14.580 --> 01:19:16.580]   So the last eight verses.
[01:19:16.580 --> 01:19:17.580]   All right?
[01:19:17.580 --> 01:19:20.580]   And I'm going to be putting up the template tonight.
[01:19:20.580 --> 01:19:21.580]   Okay?
[01:19:21.580 --> 01:19:27.580]   So here's some group discussion questions for you for your own discussion.
[01:19:27.580 --> 01:19:31.580]   The pre-discussion questions usually are for, like, textual related.
[01:19:31.580 --> 01:19:40.580]   The post-discussion is usually applicational when you're actually reflecting on your own life and your own application.
[01:19:40.580 --> 01:19:41.580]   Okay?
[01:19:41.580 --> 01:19:46.580]   So the first question, "Is your soul one that is prospering objectively?
[01:19:46.580 --> 01:19:48.580]   And how would you gauge this?
[01:19:48.580 --> 01:19:53.580]   Is there evidence that you are walking in truth?"
[01:19:53.580 --> 01:20:04.580]   Number two, "What are the steps we should take to discern whether or not we practice hospitality to those who go out for the sake of the name?"
[01:20:04.580 --> 01:20:05.580]   Okay?
[01:20:05.580 --> 01:20:06.580]   So what's the best way?
[01:20:06.580 --> 01:20:08.580]   There's a lot of stuff out there.
[01:20:08.580 --> 01:20:09.580]   What do we partner with?
[01:20:09.580 --> 01:20:10.580]   How do we join?
[01:20:10.580 --> 01:20:20.580]   Third, "In what ways can you get more involved in sending workers on their way in a manner worthy of the Lord?"
[01:20:20.580 --> 01:20:21.580]   All right?
[01:20:21.580 --> 01:20:25.580]   Let's pray together.
[01:20:25.580 --> 01:20:33.580]   Father, in our study of Your Word and in our application of Your truth, help us to walk in step with You.
[01:20:33.580 --> 01:20:43.580]   Help us not to run too far ahead or lag behind or to be entangled in sin that we are apathetic toward the things that we learn today.
[01:20:43.580 --> 01:20:53.580]   I pray for Your help to really engage not just our heads but our hearts as well, to not just meditate and think deeply upon Your Word,
[01:20:53.580 --> 01:20:56.580]   but also to put it into practice in our day-to-day lives.
[01:20:56.580 --> 01:21:03.580]   So we pray for just Your Spirit to continue to minister to us through Your truth.
