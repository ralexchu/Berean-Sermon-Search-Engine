[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.520]   11, sorry, Hebrews chapter 1. And again I want to read just the first couple verses
[00:00:11.520 --> 00:00:19.320]   before we jump into the text. Hebrews chapter 1, verses 1 and 2. God after He spoke long
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:24.180]   ago to the fathers and the prophets in many portions and in many ways. In these last days
[00:00:24.180 --> 00:00:29.100]   has spoken to us in His Son whom He appointed heir of all things through whom also He made
[00:00:29.100 --> 00:00:36.480]   the world. Let's pray. Heavenly Father we want to thank you again for the privilege
[00:00:36.480 --> 00:00:42.400]   to be able to come and worship you. We pray Father God that your grace would truly be
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:48.760]   sufficient for us. May your name be honored and glorified through our time, our singing,
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:55.320]   our giving, teaching of your word, the fellowship of your saints. We pray Father God that our
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:01:01.040]   distracted hearts Lord may be focused on you. Those who are discouraged may find encouragement
[00:01:01.040 --> 00:01:07.320]   in Christ. And those who need perseverance Lord God that we would find it through the
[00:01:07.320 --> 00:01:14.360]   strength and sanctification of the Holy Spirit. May this time be honoring and lifting to you
[00:01:14.360 --> 00:01:21.480]   in Jesus name we pray, amen. So as you guys know last week or the week before that we
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.400]   were out in India and our brothers and sisters came and they did a great job sharing and
[00:01:26.400 --> 00:01:30.760]   gave you a highlight of what happened. And again you probably heard and we asked you
[00:01:30.760 --> 00:01:35.840]   to pray that I was part of the India team and then you know I think the most common
[00:01:35.840 --> 00:01:42.280]   question that I got when I came back was how was Paris? Right? So the whole time I was
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.120]   in Paris you know I can't tell you what Paris was like but I can tell you what kind of hotels
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:50.520]   they have because I was basically stuck in a hotel for two days and then as soon as I
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:56.960]   got my visa I was out. So other than my time from the airport to the hotel and back I know
[00:01:56.960 --> 00:02:02.600]   nothing else. But that was my experience. But just to kind of give you a recap of a
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:10.040]   brief recap of what happened was here the visa says 07-01-2019. So obviously we read
[00:02:10.040 --> 00:02:15.400]   that as July 1st and then my ticketing agent also read that July 1st and then went to the
[00:02:15.400 --> 00:02:19.960]   airport the Delta airline read that as July 1st and then went through custom they read
[00:02:19.960 --> 00:02:24.720]   that as July 1st and then so all throughout this side of the world they read that as July
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:29.520]   1st until I got to Paris and got through the first screen and they read that as July 1st
[00:02:29.520 --> 00:02:33.000]   and then right before I got on the plane they said no this is not July 1st this is January
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   7th. And then they said what are you talking about I got through half the world you know
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:43.720]   and they were okay with it and they said no if we send you to India now they're going
[00:02:43.720 --> 00:02:48.080]   to send you right back so it's better for you to find out here than out in India. So
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:52.440]   I was kicked off the airplane grabbed all my bags and went to the ticket counter at
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.560]   Delta or Air France was the flight that we're taking from there and then that and then one
[00:02:57.560 --> 00:03:02.560]   of the managers there looked at my visa and she said why did they kick you off. This is
[00:03:02.560 --> 00:03:07.880]   July 1st. So she was actually trying to get me back on the airplane and then her supervisor
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.520]   eventually came in who works out in India and she said no the guy on the plane he did
[00:03:13.520 --> 00:03:18.840]   the right thing because in India it's read the other way. It's actually January 7th.
[00:03:18.840 --> 00:03:23.000]   So I ended up having to stay. So I was there for about a day and a half about two days
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   trying to figure that out and I got my visa and then I was able to get back in and join
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:33.040]   the team. And you know it was a valuable lesson hopefully you know I'll never make that mistake
[00:03:33.040 --> 00:03:37.420]   again I've double checked but to think that this half of the world you know read that
[00:03:37.420 --> 00:03:42.160]   date one way and then as soon as I got to that you know you have to understand the context
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.520]   right without that without understanding the context of how they read those numbers you're
[00:03:47.520 --> 00:03:51.840]   gonna get stuck in Paris right. Now why am I telling you the story I mean that's basically
[00:03:51.840 --> 00:03:56.640]   what happened in Paris but you know we're jumping into the book of Hebrews and Hebrews
[00:03:56.640 --> 00:04:01.920]   is one of those books that if you don't understand the context you're gonna end up getting stuck
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:07.640]   in Paris basically right. This is one of those books where so much is it's almost like a
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:15.080]   part two of book of Leviticus and so one of the main reasons why I chose the book of Hebrews
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:20.320]   is because we just got finished studying the book of Leviticus and so much of it made sense
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:25.200]   if you connected to what Christ was doing. So what's happening in the book of Hebrews
[00:04:25.200 --> 00:04:31.720]   is Leviticus points to the Christ that is coming. Hebrews points to Christ who came
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:38.880]   and points us back to Leviticus of what happened. So the best time to study the book of Hebrews
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.720]   would be now right after we studied the book of Leviticus while it is still fresh in our
[00:04:42.720 --> 00:04:50.040]   mind while your perspective from the Leviticus is still you know fresh and we just studied
[00:04:50.040 --> 00:04:55.680]   it and so much of it is going to make so much more sense now that we study it in light of
[00:04:55.680 --> 00:05:01.520]   certain things that we wrestled with in the book of Leviticus. But it's the only reason
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:05.240]   why we're studying the book of Leviticus. If it was simply to connect the dots from
[00:05:05.240 --> 00:05:09.760]   the Old Testament to the New Testament then we would be wasting our time. You can just
[00:05:09.760 --> 00:05:13.600]   read a book and read a commentary and says this is how Jesus fulfilled this and this
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:18.560]   is what Jesus did. Oh that's interesting. But the ultimate goal of the book of Hebrews
[00:05:18.560 --> 00:05:22.880]   is not to simply connect the dots with the Old and the New Testament. It is important
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:28.640]   much of what we're going to study is going to be doing that. But there is a greater purpose.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:37.400]   There is a reason beyond just theological knowledge of who Jesus is. This letter was
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:46.280]   written around 65 to 69 AD. Anybody know what was happening? Something very significant
[00:05:46.280 --> 00:05:53.080]   was happening during this period particularly for Christians. Anybody know? Persecution
[00:05:53.080 --> 00:06:00.880]   of Christians under Nero got ramped up in AD 65. So we're not talking about any like
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:05.680]   normal persecution like you know talk about going to India and you know we say that the
[00:06:05.680 --> 00:06:09.960]   Indian pastors and the Christians they are getting persecuted and it is getting bad.
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:14.520]   You know in the persecution meter I remember the first year we went in it was on it was
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.920]   like number 33 or 34 and last year was number 11 and then it went up a notch this year it
[00:06:19.920 --> 00:06:26.640]   was number 10. And now they're the the Hindu radicals are targeting even missionaries.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.240]   They're trying to eradicate missionaries out of the country and so even foreigners are
[00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:36.960]   not completely safe in that country. But as bad as that is compared to what was happening
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:42.040]   to these Christians at this particular time. In fact most commentators believe that the
[00:06:42.040 --> 00:06:48.840]   recipients of this letter were Christians, Jewish Christians in Rome. Those of you who
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:54.320]   are with us in the study of the book of Rome, the book of Romans ends in chapter 16 with
[00:06:54.320 --> 00:07:00.640]   a list of Christians who are in Rome. So the book of Hebrews is actually written to a lot
[00:07:00.640 --> 00:07:07.360]   of those people that Paul mentions at the end of chapter 16 in Romans. But the context
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:12.400]   in which these Christians are in, these Jewish Christians are in, they went through the first
[00:07:12.400 --> 00:07:19.120]   round of persecution and they passed with flying colors. You know when Paul was in prison
[00:07:19.120 --> 00:07:23.720]   the first time, remember he writes Philippians and he says because of his chains most of
[00:07:23.720 --> 00:07:28.240]   the brothers were beginning to preach the gospel with boldness. It didn't squash the
[00:07:28.240 --> 00:07:36.040]   church at all, it actually caused them to reproduce. But in AD 65 through 69 during
[00:07:36.040 --> 00:07:42.120]   this period the persecution is so intense it actually begins to test their faith and
[00:07:42.120 --> 00:07:47.000]   those who are nominal and even those who had genuine faith were starting to compromise
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:54.760]   and drift back to the Judaistic way of life. In Hebrews chapter 10, 32-34 this is how they
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:59.800]   are described. "Remember the former days when after being enlightened you endured a
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:05.720]   great conflict of sufferings, partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:11.480]   and tribulation and partly by becoming sharers with those who were so treated. For you showed
[00:08:11.480 --> 00:08:16.120]   sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully the seizure of your property, knowing that
[00:08:16.120 --> 00:08:21.440]   you have for yourselves a better possession and a lasting one." So these Christians,
[00:08:21.440 --> 00:08:27.440]   the first generation Christians here, he said they were persecuted, they were dragged into
[00:08:27.440 --> 00:08:34.520]   prison, their possessions were confiscated and he said they did all of this joyfully,
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   the first generation. This letter is written to probably the second generation Christians
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:45.920]   in this area but the persecution has become much more intense. We're not just talking
[00:08:45.920 --> 00:08:51.600]   about the threat of imprisonment, we're not just talking about taking of their possession,
[00:08:51.600 --> 00:08:57.160]   we're literally talking about people being crucified for following Jesus Christ. So when
[00:08:57.160 --> 00:09:01.360]   Jesus said to his disciples, "If you want to follow me, take up your cross and follow
[00:09:01.360 --> 00:09:05.960]   me." The way we contextualize it is, "Well what does the cross mean to me? What do I
[00:09:05.960 --> 00:09:10.560]   need to sacrifice? I need to be more bold and share my faith. I need to be more generous
[00:09:10.560 --> 00:09:17.840]   and those are the crosses that I need to bear." So we symbolize it in application. The recipients
[00:09:17.840 --> 00:09:22.440]   of this letter, the cross wasn't symbolic, it was literal. When Jesus said, "You have
[00:09:22.440 --> 00:09:26.440]   to pick up your cross," it was literally some of these men and women were being crucified
[00:09:26.440 --> 00:09:32.120]   for their faith, burned at the stake, being torn apart by lions. And as a result of that,
[00:09:32.120 --> 00:09:37.840]   some of these people who are bold in the lesser persecution were beginning to drift back because
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:45.100]   all they needed to do to avoid this persecution is not to reject Christ but to simply keep
[00:09:45.100 --> 00:09:51.480]   their mouth shut. And that's why over and over again, the author of this letter doesn't
[00:09:51.480 --> 00:09:58.040]   talk about rejecting Christ. He doesn't talk about abandoning your faith. He talks about
[00:09:58.040 --> 00:10:05.240]   drifting. He talks about neglecting. Even for us, even though it's comfortable for us
[00:10:05.240 --> 00:10:09.640]   as Christians living in Orange County, wherever it is that we live, if you're anywhere in
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.800]   the United States, obviously the idea of persecution, really in comparison to what we see around
[00:10:15.800 --> 00:10:21.120]   the world, it doesn't exist. We get made fun of, we can't say Christmas in certain areas,
[00:10:21.120 --> 00:10:28.560]   that's not persecution. It's just annoying. But the way that we can avoid even that is
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:34.880]   just keep our mouth shut. Just go to church, have great friends, participate in small groups,
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:42.280]   maybe even go to short-term missions, and be good. Be a good Christian. See, persecution
[00:10:42.280 --> 00:10:47.140]   even in India, they can easily avoid it if they stay in their village, meet with a bunch
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:52.880]   of Christians in their home, sharing their lives together. But the reason why persecution
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:58.440]   is coming is because they're trying to proselytize. They're taking the light into the darkness.
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:04.140]   And as a result, the darkness is pushing back. What was happening to these Jewish Christians
[00:11:04.140 --> 00:11:12.000]   was they were simply beginning to embrace their old Judaistic life. They were, you know,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.520]   because the Jews got along with the Romans fine as long as they kept their religion and
[00:11:15.520 --> 00:11:20.880]   they just practiced what they believed, they just kind of allowed them to exist. They didn't
[00:11:20.880 --> 00:11:25.560]   want them to make trouble. So if they drifted back and they kind of embraced some of Christianity
[00:11:25.560 --> 00:11:30.440]   and some of the legalism or Judaistic way of life, they would have just blended right
[00:11:30.440 --> 00:11:35.860]   in. But their problem was they were trying to proselytize. Apostle Paul and all the apostles,
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:42.520]   their primary work was to make disciples of all the nations. And so the warning that the
[00:11:42.520 --> 00:11:48.720]   author of the book of Hebrews constantly gives is, "Do not apostatize." He doesn't say, "Do
[00:11:48.720 --> 00:11:56.080]   not reject Christ." He says, "Do not drift from what God has given you." Hebrews chapter
[00:11:56.080 --> 00:12:01.640]   2, 1, "For this reason, we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard so that we
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:09.520]   do not drift away from it." He uses that language over and over again, drifting. You ever get
[00:12:09.520 --> 00:12:14.520]   in a tube, you know, and just sat and relaxed and during the weather and just kind of close
[00:12:14.520 --> 00:12:17.360]   your eyes for a couple minutes and you open your eyes all of a sudden you find you're
[00:12:17.360 --> 00:12:22.280]   two, three hundred yards away from the shore, right? You don't want to do that in the ocean.
[00:12:22.280 --> 00:12:26.760]   You might, you know, you might die if you do that, right? But if you're sitting in a
[00:12:26.760 --> 00:12:33.960]   tube you never drift to safety. You notice that? You don't get on a tube and then you
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:36.460]   close your eyes for a few minutes, next thing you know you're in your bedroom. Like that
[00:12:36.460 --> 00:12:41.040]   never happens. You close your eyes, you drift far away into danger. And that's the image
[00:12:41.040 --> 00:12:46.280]   that he gives. That they weren't anchored in Christ. They were just kind of neglecting
[00:12:46.280 --> 00:12:51.800]   their salvation and they began to drift back into their old way of thinking and back into
[00:12:51.800 --> 00:13:00.720]   their old way of life. He says, "Pay very close attention." In Hebrews 2, 3, "How will
[00:13:00.720 --> 00:13:08.120]   we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?" He says, "There's consequences for not paying
[00:13:08.120 --> 00:13:15.080]   attention and allowing ourselves simply to drift." If you have small children and you've
[00:13:15.080 --> 00:13:21.860]   ever been at the pool, you know, I think with the exception of Isaiah, all three of our
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:27.480]   children were in the pool and they fell in with their face down and it shocked us. Obviously,
[00:13:27.480 --> 00:13:32.160]   if you have small children, that ever happened to you. Anytime you're near the pool, you're
[00:13:32.160 --> 00:13:39.520]   on high alert, right? Because they don't make any noise. You don't hear them say, "Oh my
[00:13:39.520 --> 00:13:43.160]   gosh!" You don't hear nothing. They just kind of slip in. They just sit there quietly and
[00:13:43.160 --> 00:13:47.320]   the next thing you know they drown. You can have a conversation with somebody with your
[00:13:47.320 --> 00:13:53.080]   kid in your peripheral and just two minute conversation. You turn around, they're floating
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:57.400]   upside down in the pool. So anybody who has small children at home, you know that. When
[00:13:57.400 --> 00:14:03.720]   you're on the pool, your eye has to be on them 24/7 because it's just that quick. Because
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:10.680]   the consequence of not paying attention is your kid might drown. So if you're a single
[00:14:10.680 --> 00:14:14.400]   person and you're not used to being around children, if you ever get a chance to take
[00:14:14.400 --> 00:14:20.360]   the kids to the pool, know that. So you have to be high alert all the time. The imagery
[00:14:20.360 --> 00:14:25.140]   that's given in the book of Hebrews to these Christians is that you've taken your eye off
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:32.360]   of your salvation and now you're starting to drift. And because of this drifting, you
[00:14:32.360 --> 00:14:37.600]   don't ever drift toward God. Nobody ever just like, "Oh I'm saved." And you just kind of
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.240]   relax and you wake up on fire for God. It just doesn't happen. You typically drift away
[00:14:43.240 --> 00:14:49.560]   from God. Drift toward the things of God. Not a single one of us drifted toward God
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:57.520]   and got saved. It was a supernatural act, interference of God to break us and move us
[00:14:57.520 --> 00:15:03.760]   to a direction contrary to the world. So when he uses the imagery of drifting and neglecting,
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:10.700]   it's simply doing nothing. Just allowing ourselves to be, just go with the flow. That's why he
[00:15:10.700 --> 00:15:16.160]   says over and over again, Hebrews chapter 3, 7, "Today if you hear his voice, do not
[00:15:16.160 --> 00:15:21.880]   harden your hearts, and when they provoked me, as in the day of the trial in wilderness."
[00:15:21.880 --> 00:15:26.200]   He says over and over again, "Today." Now is the day of salvation. "Today if you hear
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:32.320]   his heart, do not harden your heart." You know, when you hear the Word of God, and if
[00:15:32.320 --> 00:15:37.620]   you're convicted in any way, if the Word of God makes any sense to you, we may have the
[00:15:37.620 --> 00:15:44.160]   temptation to think, "Right now is not a good time. I just got my job, just had a kid, just
[00:15:44.160 --> 00:15:48.840]   bought a house." And you say, "Well, you know, maybe next year I can take my faith
[00:15:48.840 --> 00:15:55.680]   more seriously." There's two problems with that. One, you may not be here tomorrow. You
[00:15:55.680 --> 00:16:02.840]   may not be here tomorrow. Most likely we will be. Most of us, at least tomorrow. In ten
[00:16:02.840 --> 00:16:08.180]   years, who knows, right? But that's not the biggest problem. Because tomorrow you may
[00:16:08.180 --> 00:16:12.600]   not be here, but the odds are, you know, say, "Okay, my chances are good that I will be
[00:16:12.600 --> 00:16:18.600]   here." But the other part of that equation is, tomorrow your heart may be so hardened
[00:16:18.600 --> 00:16:25.480]   that the Word of God makes no sense. If you harden your heart, when God convicts you and
[00:16:25.480 --> 00:16:29.200]   you say, "Hey, tomorrow," your heart will become that much harder. It's kind of like
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:33.560]   clay and you leave it out and you don't use it to mold what you intended. Next thing you
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.520]   know, you have a clay that you can't mold anymore. And what you don't realize, you and
[00:16:38.520 --> 00:16:46.400]   I don't realize, is when God convicts us, it is the grace of God that brings us to repentance.
[00:16:46.400 --> 00:16:51.680]   And when we resist the grace of God to bring us to repentance, you may wake up tomorrow
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:56.520]   and no longer have a desire to repent. And that's a typical thing that happens when somebody
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:02.960]   postpones obedience. They wake up three weeks later, three years later, and all of a sudden,
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:10.600]   no desire. It's just not there. They become so numb, not realizing that you've drifted
[00:17:10.600 --> 00:17:17.560]   far from God. And that's why He repeatedly says, "Today, if you hear His voice, if God
[00:17:17.560 --> 00:17:24.040]   is being gracious to you today, if God is bringing you to obedience today, do not postpone
[00:17:24.040 --> 00:17:28.800]   it till tomorrow." So there is a sense of urgency, not simply to connect the dots between
[00:17:28.800 --> 00:17:32.920]   Christ, the Old Testament, and the New Testament, but there's a reason why these dots are connected.
[00:17:32.920 --> 00:17:40.680]   It's to bring us to obedience, to repentance. Hebrews chapter 3, verse 12, "Take care, brethren,
[00:17:40.680 --> 00:17:45.920]   that there not be in any one of you an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:55.080]   living God." To fall away, to neglect, to drift, simply by what? Doing nothing. You
[00:17:55.080 --> 00:18:00.640]   become hearers and not doers. Whenever we hear about the Word of God, we feel convicted,
[00:18:00.640 --> 00:18:04.760]   we have warm feelings about encouragement, we look forward to go to heaven, but that's
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:11.760]   it. And we begin to drift and our heart becomes hardened. So when our hearts become hardened
[00:18:11.760 --> 00:18:17.000]   toward the things of God, toward our own salvation, Hebrews chapter 13, "Do not neglect to show
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.080]   hospitality to poor strangers." Do not, verse 16, "Do not neglect doing good and sharing."
[00:18:23.080 --> 00:18:28.120]   Because if we neglect our salvation, the natural response is to neglect the application of
[00:18:28.120 --> 00:18:35.520]   that salvation. So he says, "Do not neglect hospitality." Do not neglect good works. So
[00:18:35.520 --> 00:18:41.080]   the reason why I chose Hebrews, obviously, is because we just finished Leviticus, and
[00:18:41.080 --> 00:18:45.720]   so we're trying to connect the dots, and it'll make a lot more sense to you. But the real
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:52.160]   reason behind that is, and the more significant reason is, this is usually where most Christians
[00:18:52.160 --> 00:18:59.000]   will land. You go through your faith, you get baptized, you remember when you first
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   got saved and how excited you were, and then after two, three, four, five years, disappointment
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:10.200]   with yourself, disappointment with life, disappointment maybe with church and friends, and then you
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:16.200]   just kind of learn to exist. And when we get to that point where our heart is no longer
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:22.760]   excited for the things of God, and after a while you just accept that as being normal,
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:29.240]   and you begin to drift. Now, drift doesn't mean that you physically leave the church.
[00:19:29.240 --> 00:19:33.160]   You've never apostatized, you've never said, "I don't believe in God." You still make the
[00:19:33.160 --> 00:19:40.160]   same confession, but in your worship, in your heart for God, in your love for Christ, you
[00:19:40.160 --> 00:19:46.640]   have drifted so far away, you can't even see where you were. That's usually the struggle
[00:19:46.640 --> 00:19:55.640]   of most Christians, whether we are here or abroad. So what the author of Hebrew addresses
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:02.000]   is relevant to every single one of us, including myself. That we don't neglect our salvation,
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:08.960]   that we do not drift. Because the consequence of this drifting is not simply just feeling
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:15.760]   bad or not having passionate worship. He says in Hebrews chapter 6, 4-8, "For in the case
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.600]   of those who have once been enlightened, and have tasted of the heavenly gift, and have
[00:20:19.600 --> 00:20:24.280]   been made partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and then
[00:20:24.280 --> 00:20:29.240]   the powers of the age to come, and then have fallen away, it is impossible to renew them
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:34.920]   again to repentance, and since they again crucify to themselves the Son of God and put
[00:20:34.920 --> 00:20:39.920]   Him to open shame." A lot of people read this passage and they get confused. Is this
[00:20:39.920 --> 00:20:46.680]   talking about Christians who lose their salvation? Now, again, we said you have to understand
[00:20:46.680 --> 00:20:50.840]   in the context, in the context of the New Testament and Old Testament, because you didn't
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:56.680]   choose salvation, you can't lose salvation. Then what does he mean here? That if you've
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:21:00.080]   tasted the goodness of God and the Holy Spirit, and then you fall away, there is no other
[00:21:00.080 --> 00:21:06.120]   repentance. Again, even in the context of the book of Hebrews, that wouldn't fit. He's
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:12.160]   talking about people who confess their faith. He's talking about people who probably were
[00:21:12.160 --> 00:21:18.800]   baptized. Maybe even leaders in the church at one point. People who went to short-term
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:25.480]   mission, maybe Sunday school teachers, worship leaders, leaders at one point. And they don't
[00:21:25.480 --> 00:21:29.820]   persevere in their faith, and they begin to put their hope in something else outside of
[00:21:29.820 --> 00:21:36.720]   Christ. He said there is no other way of salvation but Christ. So if you drift from Christ, there
[00:21:36.720 --> 00:21:44.940]   is no repentance. That's what he means. Verse 7, "For the ground that drinks the rain, which
[00:21:44.940 --> 00:21:51.040]   often falls on it and brings forth vegetation useful to those for whose sake it is tilled,
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.320]   receives a blessing from God." In other words, here's the same rain that falls on the ground,
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   but this ground comes up and it bears fruit and the Lord blesses it. But the second ground,
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:06.100]   but if it yields thorns and thistles, it is worthless and close to being cursed and it
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:12.000]   ends up being burned. Both soils receive the same blessing. One turns into fruit, the other
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:17.360]   one turns into thorns and thistles, bitterness and anger. How many of you know people who've
[00:22:17.360 --> 00:22:22.280]   been in church at one point, was excited about their faith, and then they're no longer walking
[00:22:22.280 --> 00:22:29.760]   with God? We've all experienced the same disappointments. We've all experienced the struggles, and
[00:22:29.760 --> 00:22:36.760]   yet one produced fruit, the other one produced bitterness and thorns and thistles. He says
[00:22:36.760 --> 00:22:44.400]   the consequence of not persevering and just drifting from your faith, there is no other
[00:22:44.400 --> 00:22:52.800]   repentance, there is no other salvation. So the moment we no longer cling to Christ, we
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:58.320]   are lost. So he's not simply saying, "Hey, if you want to have an easy life, make sure
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:03.080]   that you cling to Christ. If you want to have greater fellowship, make sure you cling to
[00:23:03.080 --> 00:23:09.840]   Christ." He says our salvation hinges upon our connection to Christ, past, present and
[00:23:09.840 --> 00:23:18.240]   future. And just like John says in 1st John, "They left us because they were never of us."
[00:23:18.240 --> 00:23:27.440]   They drifted from us because they never belonged to us to begin with. Perseverance of the saints
[00:23:27.440 --> 00:23:33.320]   is not an option, because the scripture clearly says. One of the evidences, one of the biggest
[00:23:33.320 --> 00:23:37.640]   evidences of a Christian who's been a Christian for a long period of time, that he perseveres
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:47.440]   through the trials. That's why in Hebrews chapter 12, he says to fix your eyes upon
[00:23:47.440 --> 00:23:56.440]   Jesus. He is the author and the finisher, the perfecter of our faith. If we got in the
[00:23:56.440 --> 00:24:04.200]   habit of celebrating his justification and just coasting through our sanctification,
[00:24:04.200 --> 00:24:07.640]   and kind of fixed our eyes upon Christ when we first met him, and then just started to
[00:24:07.640 --> 00:24:12.880]   drift along and neglecting our salvation, that passage is relevant. That warning is
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:20.400]   for you. Do not neglect such great salvation. So over and over again, he's the perfecter
[00:24:20.400 --> 00:24:27.840]   and the finisher. He's the author and the perfecter of our faith, beginning, present
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:34.320]   and future. And that's exactly what he's going to do in the book of Hebrews. He's going to
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:40.120]   fix our eyes upon Christ. So if you notice your program, the title of the book of Hebrews
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:46.280]   is "Jesus is better than..." because that's a central message of the book of Hebrews.
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:52.120]   Whatever is distracting you to think that that's better than Jesus, if Super Bowl is
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:25:02.280]   better than Jesus, then you're going to drift toward that. If money is better than Jesus,
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:05.200]   it may not happen today, but you're just going to drift. You're not going to make a decision,
[00:25:05.200 --> 00:25:09.960]   I'm going to worship money. You're not going to do that. You're just going to drift toward
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:15.720]   that. If your family is your primary idol, you're not going to say, I'm going to worship
[00:25:15.720 --> 00:25:21.720]   my kids. You're just going to drift toward that. By neglecting your salvation, you're
[00:25:21.720 --> 00:25:30.720]   going to drift toward what we naturally end up drifting toward. So the theme and the primary
[00:25:30.720 --> 00:25:36.720]   teaching in the book of Hebrews is Jesus is better than... So chapter 1, he begins by
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.120]   saying Jesus is better than the angels. In the Old Testament Jewish mind, there's nothing
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.000]   higher than the angels. It's God and then the angels. So he starts out from the very
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   beginning with a bang. He doesn't start out and say, Jesus is better than your mom, he's
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:58.320]   better than your grandfather. He starts from the top. He's greater than the angels. And
[00:25:58.320 --> 00:26:04.000]   then he kind of goes down the list. Chapter 3, Jesus is better than Moses, the greatest
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:10.400]   leader in Israel's history. And then chapter 4, it says Jesus is better than Joshua. Because
[00:26:10.400 --> 00:26:14.840]   these people were constantly living, thinking like, man if we had another Joshua to deliver
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:22.360]   us from the Roman grasp. He says, Jesus is better than Joshua. And then Hebrews chapter
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:29.360]   5 and on, he says, Jesus is better than Aaron and his priesthood. And so that's where he
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:34.760]   begins to connect us to the book of Leviticus and all the sacrificial system. Because he's
[00:26:34.760 --> 00:26:40.680]   better than Aaron, he comes in the order of the priesthood of Melchizedek. His priesthood
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:48.080]   is better, his sacrifice is better, his covenant is better, and his salvation is better, and
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:56.240]   his rest is better. And so his whole theme of the book of Hebrews is Jesus is better.
[00:26:56.240 --> 00:27:01.480]   And so the goal of our study in the book of Hebrews is for you who believe, those who
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:12.440]   have ears to hear and eyes to see, to be reminded again, who is Jesus to you? I know what they
[00:27:12.440 --> 00:27:18.760]   say, I know what the pastors say, I know what the leaders say, but who do you say I am?
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:24.000]   Is Jesus really better? Is he really better than your family? Is he really better than
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.940]   your hope? Is he really better than your job? Is he better than your wife or your husband?
[00:27:29.940 --> 00:27:36.320]   Better than your children? Is he better? That's the argument and that's the premise of the
[00:27:36.320 --> 00:27:43.120]   book of Hebrews. But the goal is not simply to ask the question, is he better? Because
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:48.960]   we can say, yes he's better. But that's not where the author of Hebrews leaves us. Because
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   we confess that every single time we come to church on Sunday. We sing songs. And every
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:28:01.840]   single one of these songs says, it's a confession, Jesus is better. He's better than the lily
[00:28:01.840 --> 00:28:06.840]   of the valleys. Right? He's better. We sing it all the time, it's our confession. But
[00:28:06.840 --> 00:28:11.900]   the goal of Hebrews is not simply to get us to confess. Over and over again we'll see
[00:28:11.900 --> 00:28:20.520]   the word therefore. Remember? In interpretation when you see therefore, you have to ask, what
[00:28:20.520 --> 00:28:25.820]   is the therefore, therefore? Why is that there? Because therefore connects us to what he's
[00:28:25.820 --> 00:28:32.080]   been saying. So every time he would tell us about Jesus being better, he says, therefore
[00:28:32.080 --> 00:28:39.860]   you ought to do this. Chapter 4 verse 1, therefore let us fear while a promise remains of entering
[00:28:39.860 --> 00:28:46.880]   his rest. You know that idea of fearing in the New Testament? For whatever the reason,
[00:28:46.880 --> 00:28:53.060]   we have erased that vocabulary in the New Testament. And it almost sounds like heresy
[00:28:53.060 --> 00:29:00.740]   when somebody says, we need to fear. Because it sounds strange. But if you've read your
[00:29:00.740 --> 00:29:09.640]   Bible from Genesis to Revelation, one of the primary things that God tells his people is
[00:29:09.640 --> 00:29:15.700]   to fear him. In fact, the book of Ecclesiastes, Solomon says, the chief end of man is to fear
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:22.580]   God and obey his commandment. The apostle Paul says, live out your salvation with fear
[00:29:22.580 --> 00:29:30.420]   and trembling. So we've somehow made, we took it, taken one verse where it says, love casts
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:36.680]   out fear. So anything that causes any kind of fear is heresy. Completely unbiblical.
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:44.500]   Look at scripture all over the Bible. It tells us to fear God because fear is necessary.
[00:29:44.500 --> 00:29:50.940]   You know, we've equated fear just universally all being negative. Without fear, you get
[00:29:50.940 --> 00:29:59.440]   fired, you get hurt, you die. Fear of getting hurt causes us to stay away from danger. If
[00:29:59.440 --> 00:30:03.620]   you don't fear pain, you don't fear getting hurt or losing your limbs, I mean, there are
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:09.460]   a lot of things we could do. If you don't fear losing your job, a job that you loved
[00:30:09.460 --> 00:30:12.300]   and prayed for, and you go, I don't care if I lose my job, then you're going to lose your
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:18.340]   job. You're probably not going to be a good worker. Fear of being a bad parent causes
[00:30:18.340 --> 00:30:25.300]   you to examine the way you parent your kids. Fear of being a bad husband or bad wife causes
[00:30:25.300 --> 00:30:32.380]   you to look at your life and make sure that we're doing and saying what is right. So there's
[00:30:32.380 --> 00:30:38.100]   a healthy fear. There is a bad fear, and that's what he was talking about when he says, love
[00:30:38.100 --> 00:30:42.260]   casts out fear. In other words, if you are assured with the love of God, then it casts
[00:30:42.260 --> 00:30:49.020]   out the fear of judgment. But fear in and of itself, fear of the Lord in particular,
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:54.900]   is necessary. He says, "Therefore, fear while a promise remains entering his rest." If you've
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:31:03.100]   seen yourself drift and you've been neglecting your faith for periods of time, it should
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:10.860]   be fear that you feel, not comfort and encouragement, because that fear is what will bring you to
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:18.380]   Christ. It is that fear that will cause you to repent. Chapter 4, verse 11, "Therefore,
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:22.660]   let us be diligent to enter that rest, so that no one will fall through following the
[00:31:22.660 --> 00:31:27.820]   same example of disobedience." Let us be diligent. For whatever the reason, we're diligent in
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:32.980]   our justification, and then we're passive in our sanctification. It's legalism if we
[00:31:32.980 --> 00:31:39.460]   try too hard. Absolutely contrary to what we see in Scripture. He said, "Let us be diligent."
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.860]   Paul himself says, "I buffet my body, making my slave, lest possibly after I have preached
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:51.260]   to others that I may be disqualified." Paul says, not Paul, the author of Hebrews, says,
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:57.780]   "Let us be diligent that we do not neglect and drift." Chapter 4, verse 14, "Therefore,
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:01.340]   since we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens, Jesus, Son of
[00:32:01.340 --> 00:32:06.020]   God, let us hold fast our confession." You know what was interesting? The word for "hold
[00:32:06.020 --> 00:32:11.820]   fast" here means to own it. Okay? And what does it mean in our culture when we say to
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:19.060]   own something? Don't just do it, own it. What does that mean? Don't just play football,
[00:32:19.060 --> 00:32:28.300]   own it. Meaning to dominate, to conquer, to be the best, give all you have, own it. That's
[00:32:28.300 --> 00:32:33.420]   the word here, to possess it. Not simply to hold on to it loosely, not simply to confess
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:41.660]   it, but make that your primary objective in life. Make the gospel, loving the gospel,
[00:32:41.660 --> 00:32:46.780]   preaching the gospel, bringing non-Christians to Christ, encouraging other Christians to
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:54.740]   persevere, to hold fast to this confession. Chapter 4, verse 16, "Let us draw near with
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:32:58.820]   confidence to the throne of grace, so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help
[00:32:58.820 --> 00:33:04.060]   in time of need." Let us draw near, because the whole point of salvation is that the access
[00:33:04.060 --> 00:33:10.860]   to God that was blocked because of our sins were made clear by the blood of Christ. That's
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:16.700]   salvation. Now we have access, so we talk about adoption. Why is the talk of adoption
[00:33:16.700 --> 00:33:25.540]   so good? Why does it give us warm feelings? Just simply because you have the title? No,
[00:33:25.540 --> 00:33:32.940]   because to be adopted means everything that belonged to Him is yours. God is yours now.
[00:33:32.940 --> 00:33:40.540]   You can enter the inner sanctuary without somebody saying stop. I'm going to my father's
[00:33:40.540 --> 00:33:46.340]   room. I can go into my dad's room, because that's my dad's room. But it would make absolutely
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:52.500]   no sense if you have front row seats to the Super Bowl today, and you've been telling
[00:33:52.500 --> 00:33:57.140]   all your friends that you have, you have free tickets, and then what's the next question
[00:33:57.140 --> 00:34:07.700]   they're going to ask you? What are you doing here? You really have tickets to Super Bowl?
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:14.300]   Those are 20, 30, 40 thousand dollar tickets. You're going around telling everybody that
[00:34:14.300 --> 00:34:21.940]   you have access? You can get front row seats to the best show in town today? What are you
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:28.740]   doing here? I don't think you have it. No one's going to believe you have it, because
[00:34:28.740 --> 00:34:34.260]   it doesn't make sense for somebody who says that they have it, not to go. The whole point
[00:34:34.260 --> 00:34:39.900]   of our salvation is to have access to God. So if you have this access to God, He says
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:46.860]   let us draw near to the throne of grace with confidence, because that's the goal, that's
[00:34:46.860 --> 00:34:51.260]   the point of salvation. Chapter 6 verse 1, therefore leaving the elementary teachings
[00:34:51.260 --> 00:34:57.660]   about Christ, let us press on to maturity. Don't accept the fact that you've been stagnant
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:35:03.740]   for a long period of time. Stop making excuses and press on toward the goal. Let us draw
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:08.340]   near with sincere hearts. Chapter 10 verse 23, let us hold fast the confession of our
[00:35:08.340 --> 00:35:15.380]   hope without wavering, for he who promised is faithful. 10 24, let us consider how to
[00:35:15.380 --> 00:35:19.780]   stimulate one another on toward loving good deeds. If this is so significant, not only
[00:35:19.780 --> 00:35:24.780]   for ourselves, but for the brothers and sisters. How do we stimulate them, encourage them?
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:28.460]   Chapter 12 verse 1, therefore since we have so great a crowd of witnesses around us, let
[00:35:28.460 --> 00:35:35.180]   us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles. Don't accept
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:40.700]   the compromises in your life that has caused you to drift away from God. Whatever has entangled
[00:35:40.700 --> 00:35:46.100]   you, he says lay it aside. And then 12 verse 1, let us run with endurance the race that
[00:35:46.100 --> 00:35:50.860]   is set before us. It's not enough that you started the race, but to continue the race.
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:56.460]   Verse 28, let us show gratitude by which we may offer to God an acceptable service. Chapter
[00:35:56.460 --> 00:36:02.300]   13 verse 3, let us go out to him, outside the camp bearing his reproach. If what Christ
[00:36:02.300 --> 00:36:09.740]   has done, if Jesus truly is better than everything else in our lives, then let's go where he
[00:36:09.740 --> 00:36:22.220]   is. Let's go after him. You know, people travel to uncomfortable places, enduring intense
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:28.720]   heat, eating food they don't like, being surrounded by people that they don't like, all for the
[00:36:28.720 --> 00:36:38.660]   purpose of making money. People will pack their bags, go to foreign countries, endure
[00:36:38.660 --> 00:36:46.020]   awkward situations for years in the hope that they're going to make it big. They're going
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:53.500]   to make money. Because that's where their hope is. That's where their passion is. And
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:37:02.300]   so they go there. But if Jesus is better than that, if Jesus is better than all that that
[00:37:02.300 --> 00:37:12.140]   we confess, shouldn't we also follow him outside the camp? Whether that takes us to China,
[00:37:12.140 --> 00:37:17.960]   whether that takes us to Japan, whether that takes us to India, whether that takes us to
[00:37:17.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   your co-workers or your neighbors, wherever it is that God has placed you. If Jesus is
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:31.640]   better, let's go outside the camp. And then verse 15, through him then let us continually
[00:37:31.640 --> 00:37:36.180]   offer up a sacrifice of praise to God, to be worshippers who will worship him in spirit
[00:37:36.180 --> 00:37:41.120]   and in truth. See, this is the ultimate goal of the book of Hebrews. It's not simply to
[00:37:41.120 --> 00:37:44.860]   connect the dots and say, "Oh, I know Leviticus now, and I know the Old Testament and New
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:52.240]   Testament, and I know all this theological things that I can tell you." But therefore,
[00:37:52.240 --> 00:37:59.560]   let us go, let us fear, let us be diligent, let us draw near, let us consider how to stimulate
[00:37:59.560 --> 00:38:07.760]   one another, let us persevere, let us go outside the camp. So my hope is that through the book
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:15.120]   of, study of the book of Hebrews, that we would be able to confess with our mouth and
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:23.360]   with our lives that Jesus is better. Because if Jesus is not better, whatever is better
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:30.060]   than Jesus will cause you to drift toward that. Before we open up the communion table,
[00:38:30.060 --> 00:38:33.600]   I want to sing this song together. So I'm going to ask the praise team to come up. You
[00:38:33.600 --> 00:38:38.520]   guys probably all know this song, but I want to sing this together because this is pretty
[00:38:38.520 --> 00:38:46.480]   much the theme of the book of Hebrews. "I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold." I
[00:38:46.480 --> 00:38:52.940]   want to sing this as often as I can to remind you that this is really the point of the book
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:39:00.200]   of Hebrews and why we're studying this. "I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold." And
[00:39:00.200 --> 00:39:04.480]   let me stop right there. Okay. Don't worry. I'm not going to give another sermon. "I'd
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:10.360]   rather have Jesus than silver or gold. I'd rather be his than have riches untold. I'd
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:16.480]   rather have Jesus than houses or lands. I'd rather be led by his nail pierced hand." I
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:20.760]   pray that the study of the book of Hebrews would cause us to confess this and mean this
[00:39:20.760 --> 00:39:27.040]   with all our heart. That these aren't just words that we sing. These aren't some doctrinal
[00:39:27.040 --> 00:39:32.320]   statements that we say, "Oh, we adhere to." But this is actually a confession of our mouth
[00:39:32.320 --> 00:39:35.840]   and our lives. Let's sing this song together. "I'd rather have Jesus."
