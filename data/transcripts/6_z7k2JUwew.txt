[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:19.440]   where we are able to be in a situation
[00:12:19.440 --> 00:12:21.440]   where we can honor you,
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:23.440]   we can take care of our children.
[00:12:23.440 --> 00:12:26.440]   We thank you, Father, for living in a free country
[00:12:26.440 --> 00:12:28.440]   where we can worship you, Father God,
[00:12:28.440 --> 00:12:32.440]   and gather together without fear of harm.
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:34.440]   But in the midst of all of this,
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.440]   help us, Lord, not to take for granted what we have,
[00:12:38.440 --> 00:12:41.440]   that we may return it back to you, Father God,
[00:12:41.440 --> 00:12:43.440]   that it may be used for your glory.
[00:12:43.520 --> 00:12:46.440]   Help us, Lord, to give cheerfully.
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:49.440]   Help us to give in a way that honors you, glorifies you.
[00:12:49.440 --> 00:12:52.440]   May the offering we give be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.440]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:12:54.440 --> 00:12:57.440]   We thank you, Father, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:13:51.200 --> 00:13:55.200]   Why don't we just take a minute to turn around, say hello
[00:13:55.200 --> 00:13:57.200]   to the people who we are worshiping with.
[00:13:57.200 --> 00:14:01.200]   We'll give you a minute or two just to say hi,
[00:14:01.200 --> 00:14:05.200]   greet one another, and we will get started here.

[00:23:18.280 --> 00:23:23.280]   Hello, everyone.
[00:23:23.280 --> 00:23:26.280]   My name is Josh Choi, and I'll be giving my testimony today.
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:42.280]   From my earliest memories, I was a part of two homes.
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:47.280]   One was the embrace of my family, my mom, dad, older and younger brother.
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:53.280]   The other was the church, an anchor introduced to us by my mother,
[00:23:53.280 --> 00:23:58.280]   who ensured our regular attendance every Sunday.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:01.280]   In my elementary and middle school years,
[00:24:01.280 --> 00:24:05.280]   I walked and grew in the church alongside my peers.
[00:24:05.280 --> 00:24:11.280]   Whether in the praise team, church orchestra, body worship team, or youth group,
[00:24:11.280 --> 00:24:14.280]   the church was my second home.
[00:24:14.280 --> 00:24:18.280]   Back then, I loved my brothers and sisters,
[00:24:18.280 --> 00:24:22.280]   and I wished to walk with them, at least until high school graduation.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:29.280]   But things took a turn when my church experienced a schism.
[00:24:29.280 --> 00:24:33.280]   The schism stemmed from sin within leadership disagreements,
[00:24:33.280 --> 00:24:37.280]   which escalated into legal disputes, lawsuits, and assaults.
[00:24:37.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   The church, which I had once perceived as an emblem of love and unity,
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:44.280]   was now marred by conflicts.
[00:24:44.280 --> 00:24:50.280]   The most discerning aspect was witnessing friends,
[00:24:50.280 --> 00:24:55.280]   including my youth pastor, distance themselves from me in fear of the schism.
[00:24:55.280 --> 00:24:58.280]   I felt the brunt of the aftermath,
[00:24:58.280 --> 00:25:02.280]   though I had played no role in the conflict's inception.
[00:25:02.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   Consequently, my heart grew cold against God,
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:14.280]   and my depression and anxiety at the time worsened.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:17.280]   From a young age, I faced challenges in connecting with others,
[00:25:17.280 --> 00:25:22.280]   perhaps rooted in deep-seated trust issues and an instinct to rely heavily on myself,
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:26.280]   all rooted in sin and the fear of rejection.
[00:25:26.280 --> 00:25:29.280]   These struggles manifested in forms like insomnia during elementary school,
[00:25:29.280 --> 00:25:32.280]   and later as depression and anxiety.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:45.280]   In the quest for solace,
[00:25:45.280 --> 00:25:50.280]   I often found myself delving into worldly desires of lust for pleasure,
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:52.280]   worship of academic achievement,
[00:25:52.280 --> 00:25:56.280]   and selfish tendencies to cling to comfort and security.
[00:25:56.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   However, this worldly water left me wrecked and thirsting for more than before,
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.280]   and I reached a breaking point where I was left in bed, desperate,
[00:26:05.280 --> 00:26:08.280]   and calling out to God to save me.
[00:26:08.280 --> 00:26:11.280]   And by his grace, the Lord drew me to his bed.
[00:26:11.280 --> 00:26:14.280]   And not going to lie, it was kind of funny thinking back.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:18.280]   I opened the Bible app, even though I barely read the Bible.
[00:26:18.280 --> 00:26:21.280]   I don't even know why I had the app.
[00:26:21.280 --> 00:26:27.280]   But the first thing I saw on the app was a reading plan for anxious people.
[00:26:27.280 --> 00:26:33.280]   Reading from the plan, I read passages and sermons that helped soothe my anxiety.
[00:26:33.280 --> 00:26:36.280]   My favorite was Philippians 4, 6-7.
[00:26:36.280 --> 00:26:41.280]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in every situation, by prayer and petition,
[00:26:41.280 --> 00:26:44.280]   with thanksgiving, present your request to God, and the peace of God,
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:56.280]   which transcends all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:26:56.280 --> 00:27:01.280]   Though this verse didn't instantaneously cure my ailments, it was a beacon,
[00:27:01.280 --> 00:27:04.280]   drawing me back to the Bible and teachings of the gospel.
[00:27:04.280 --> 00:27:07.280]   Then, over the few years, including my first year at UCI,
[00:27:07.280 --> 00:27:10.280]   I committed to attending church and reading his word.
[00:27:10.280 --> 00:27:14.280]   During this time, I learned of God's loving and powerful character,
[00:27:14.280 --> 00:27:19.280]   but I also learned more about my sinful nature and the harsh reality
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:23.280]   that I previously loved God only for what he offered to me.
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   For the longest time, I went to church either to find a community
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:30.280]   or to help aid my life problems.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.280]   Like back in middle school when I went to church to seek after a community,
[00:27:33.280 --> 00:27:37.280]   or back in high school when I leveraged anxiety and Bible plans
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:40.280]   as a coping method for my mental illnesses.
[00:27:40.280 --> 00:27:44.280]   I perverted Christianity to serve my own needs.
[00:27:44.280 --> 00:27:48.280]   I indulged in sin while deceiving myself that I was a Christian.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:52.280]   After all, it's easy to pose as one,
[00:27:52.280 --> 00:27:55.280]   especially when the benefits far outweigh the costs.
[00:27:55.280 --> 00:27:58.280]   All you have to do is say that you love this God that Christians speak of.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:01.280]   After that, you immerse yourself in the moral teachings of the Bible,
[00:28:01.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   which objectively benefits anyone reading it.
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:09.280]   And best of all, proclaiming this love will secure love and support
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:11.280]   from a community of Christians.
[00:28:11.280 --> 00:28:13.280]   And to add a cherry on top,
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:18.280]   picking up positions like praise team or some form of servant team
[00:28:18.280 --> 00:28:22.280]   will further bolster the respect and love you receive from your community.
[00:28:22.280 --> 00:28:28.280]   And it can also inspire a self-feeding feeling of meaning and purpose in life.
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.280]   It's almost like an all-in-one deal for someone who wants to capitalize
[00:28:32.280 --> 00:28:36.280]   on an avenue of a morally good life.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:39.280]   I could have easily continued simply going to church like this,
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:42.280]   growing up benefiting from the church,
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:45.280]   and probably more so during adulthood when I have kids
[00:28:45.280 --> 00:28:48.280]   whom I would also send to church
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:52.280]   in hopes that they would also lead moral lives.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:56.280]   However, this past life of mine was void of God.
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.280]   Matthew 7, 21-23.
[00:28:59.280 --> 00:29:02.280]   "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:29:02.280 --> 00:29:05.280]   but the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven.
[00:29:05.280 --> 00:29:09.280]   On that day, many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, do we not prophesy in your name
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:14.280]   and cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'
[00:29:14.280 --> 00:29:18.280]   And then I will declare to him, 'I never knew you.
[00:29:18.280 --> 00:29:22.280]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:27.280]   Reading this verse, even after a lifetime of going to church,
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:32.280]   I felt a heavy conviction that changed my paradigm of faith.
[00:29:32.280 --> 00:29:35.280]   And I began viewing my walk with heavy scrutiny,
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:40.280]   discovering more and more ulterior motives I had in the past coming to church.
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:44.280]   I felt the overwhelming sin running through my veins.
[00:29:44.280 --> 00:29:50.280]   However, with each and every sin in the past,
[00:29:50.280 --> 00:29:53.280]   I saw God faithfully working in my life,
[00:29:53.280 --> 00:29:56.280]   even using my sins to draw me close to him.
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:59.280]   And to this I repent.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:01.280]   Ephesians 2, 4-5.
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   "But God, who is rich in mercy, out of the great love with which he loved us,
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:08.280]   even when we were dead through our trespasses,
[00:30:08.280 --> 00:30:11.280]   we are now living this life together in Christ.
[00:30:11.280 --> 00:30:14.280]   By grace, you have been saved."
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:19.280]   God has saved me from sin, and I am here today because the Lord has allowed me to.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:24.280]   It is through his redemptive power that I can stand and live to see every day.
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:29.280]   Despite my sins, the Lord has shown me mercy and grace from time to time,
[00:30:29.280 --> 00:30:32.280]   and I am grateful.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:34.280]   I desire to live a life that is surrender to God,
[00:30:34.280 --> 00:30:37.280]   and I strive to give worship that is pleasing to him.
[00:30:37.280 --> 00:30:47.280]   And with that, today I proclaim that the Lord my God is my Father, Lord, and Savior.
[00:30:47.280 --> 00:30:58.280]   [applause]
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:05.280]   [water splashing]
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:07.280]   >> Now, should you understand when you go into the water,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:09.280]   you're being united to Christ's death,
[00:31:09.280 --> 00:31:11.280]   and when you come out, you're being united to his resurrected life?
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   >> Yes.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:16.280]   >> I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:16.280 --> 00:31:36.280]   [water splashing]
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:39.280]   >> All right, thank you, Joshua, for that great testimony.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:44.280]   And he did say he was a middle child with three boys, right?
[00:31:44.280 --> 00:31:46.280]   He did, right? Yeah.
[00:31:46.280 --> 00:31:50.280]   So I'll have a special heart for him.
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:53.280]   I understand you.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:57.280]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Luke 6:27,
[00:31:57.280 --> 00:31:59.280]   and we're going to read up to 36,
[00:31:59.280 --> 00:32:05.280]   but the main text that we're going to be looking at is in the first two verses.
[00:32:05.280 --> 00:32:09.280]   Luke 6, verse 27 and on.
[00:32:09.280 --> 00:32:14.280]   "But I say to you who hear, love your enemies, do good to those who hate you,
[00:32:14.280 --> 00:32:18.280]   bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:21.280]   Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:26.280]   and whoever takes away your coat, do not withhold your shirt from him either.
[00:32:26.280 --> 00:32:29.280]   Give to everyone who asks of you, and whoever takes away what is yours,
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:31.280]   do not demand it back.
[00:32:31.280 --> 00:32:34.280]   Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.
[00:32:34.280 --> 00:32:39.280]   If you love those who love you, what credit is that for you?
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:41.280]   For even sinners love those who love them.
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you?
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:47.280]   For even sinners do the same.
[00:32:47.280 --> 00:32:52.280]   If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you?
[00:32:52.280 --> 00:32:56.280]   Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount.
[00:32:56.280 --> 00:33:00.280]   But love your enemies, and do good, and lend, expecting nothing in return,
[00:33:00.280 --> 00:33:02.280]   and your reward will be great,
[00:33:02.280 --> 00:33:04.280]   and you will be sons of the Most High,
[00:33:04.280 --> 00:33:09.280]   for he himself is kind to ungrateful and even evil men.
[00:33:09.280 --> 00:33:12.280]   Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
[00:33:12.280 --> 00:33:16.280]   Let's pray.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:21.280]   Gracious Father, give us understanding,
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:27.280]   give us moldable hearts, thoughts, lives,
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   that we may give to you a living sacrifice.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:35.280]   We pray for your Holy Spirit's empowerment, guidance,
[00:33:35.280 --> 00:33:38.280]   directing and sanctification through your word.
[00:33:38.280 --> 00:33:42.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:47.280]   I think many of you know that in the earlier part of our church,
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:53.280]   because we didn't have enough finances in the church,
[00:33:53.280 --> 00:33:56.280]   and they did a lot of odd jobs in order to provide for the family.
[00:33:56.280 --> 00:34:00.280]   And one of the things that I had to do was I became an ESL teacher,
[00:34:00.280 --> 00:34:06.280]   where I taught citizenship to Korean grandparents,
[00:34:06.280 --> 00:34:08.280]   who were like 70 and older,
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   and every week, literally I had one lesson that I taught for five years,
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.280]   because they would keep forgetting.
[00:34:14.280 --> 00:34:16.280]   And literally every single day, it's like,
[00:34:16.280 --> 00:34:20.280]   "Today is Monday, October 3rd, 19 something something,"
[00:34:20.280 --> 00:34:22.280]   and then they would just repeat it after me.
[00:34:22.280 --> 00:34:26.280]   So in one sense it was frustrating, but in another sense it was easy,
[00:34:26.280 --> 00:34:28.280]   because I never had to prepare.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:32.280]   I would teach the same lesson like it was brand new, every single day.
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:38.280]   But one of the joys of the class was watching the older ladies become citizens
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.280]   and how excited they were.
[00:34:40.280 --> 00:34:44.280]   And I remember going through the citizenship course
[00:34:44.280 --> 00:34:48.280]   and just helping them to answer quick, "Who is Francis Scott Key?"
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:51.280]   "When did the Declaration of Independence happen?"
[00:34:51.280 --> 00:34:55.280]   And so as they're going through, I had to figure out,
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:58.280]   like, these are the things that are necessary.
[00:34:58.280 --> 00:35:01.280]   You have to have a visa for five years,
[00:35:01.280 --> 00:35:03.280]   and you have to live in the United States,
[00:35:03.280 --> 00:35:05.280]   and you have to apply and do this and that.
[00:35:05.280 --> 00:35:09.280]   And then when they finally did become a citizen, just an elation, right?
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:12.280]   Because many of these ladies came from--like went through the war.
[00:35:12.280 --> 00:35:15.280]   They were older than my parents, and so they went through the war,
[00:35:15.280 --> 00:35:21.280]   and they knew what it was like to be raised during the Japanese occupation of Korea,
[00:35:21.280 --> 00:35:24.280]   also through the Korean War, experiencing poverty,
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:27.280]   and for them, being a citizen of the United States was kind of like--
[00:35:27.280 --> 00:35:31.280]   almost like going to heaven, almost, you know, for them.
[00:35:31.280 --> 00:35:35.280]   And so I remember very distinctly just how happy they were
[00:35:35.280 --> 00:35:39.280]   when they became the citizen of the United States.
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:46.280]   Can you imagine the elation, right, for Christians experiencing what it was like?
[00:35:46.280 --> 00:35:50.280]   And I think every single person that has genuinely met Christ
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:53.280]   knows what it was like before we met Christ.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:56.280]   And then to become the citizen of the kingdom of God.
[00:35:56.280 --> 00:35:59.280]   You know, last couple weeks, we've been talking about the Beatitudes,
[00:35:59.280 --> 00:36:03.280]   and Beatitude basically is the entrance into the kingdom.
[00:36:03.280 --> 00:36:08.280]   These are the things that causes us to come into this kingdom.
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:12.280]   He says, "Blessed are those who are poor, for theirs is the kingdom of God."
[00:36:12.280 --> 00:36:18.280]   He's not simply saying those who are financial, who has lower economic status,
[00:36:18.280 --> 00:36:20.280]   that for theirs is God's kingdom.
[00:36:20.280 --> 00:36:24.280]   Obviously, he's talking even beyond that, right?
[00:36:24.280 --> 00:36:27.280]   That in order for us to enter the kingdom of heaven,
[00:36:27.280 --> 00:36:30.280]   we need to recognize our spiritual poverty,
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:33.280]   which leads us to hungering and thirsting for righteousness.
[00:36:33.280 --> 00:36:36.280]   He says, "Those who hunger will be satisfied."
[00:36:36.280 --> 00:36:38.280]   And then those who weep, right?
[00:36:38.280 --> 00:36:41.280]   Those who--again, if we were to read that in that context,
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:44.280]   those who weep are the ones who are repenting.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.280]   They recognize their poverty.
[00:36:46.280 --> 00:36:51.280]   "For theirs is then my hunger, which causes them to repent and weep."
[00:36:51.280 --> 00:36:53.280]   And then it says, "Blessed are those who are hated,
[00:36:53.280 --> 00:36:56.280]   because now they are part of the new kingdom,
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:59.280]   that the people of the old kingdom will hate you,
[00:36:59.280 --> 00:37:03.280]   because these two kingdoms are in conflict."
[00:37:03.280 --> 00:37:06.280]   Before we were enemies of the cross, now we are enemies of the world.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.280]   And as a result of that, he says,
[00:37:08.280 --> 00:37:11.280]   "Those who you were a part of, now they hate you."
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:15.280]   And he said, so that was the entrance into the kingdom of God.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:18.280]   What we're going to be talking about for the next few weeks,
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:22.280]   maybe even a few months, even though it's a short text,
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:25.280]   that now that we are citizens of the new kingdom,
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:30.280]   what is the central character of the citizen of God's kingdom?
[00:37:30.280 --> 00:37:34.280]   We already know what the passage says.
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:38.280]   The Scripture tells us that the central aspect of who we are is love.
[00:37:38.280 --> 00:37:40.280]   In 2 Peter 1:4 it says,
[00:37:40.280 --> 00:37:44.280]   "For by these he has granted to us the precious and magnificent promises,
[00:37:44.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   so that by them you may become partakers of the divine nature."
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.280]   The divine nature, having escaped the corruption that is in the world by lust.
[00:37:53.280 --> 00:37:58.280]   You notice here, salvation isn't simply somebody who deserved punitive penalty,
[00:37:58.280 --> 00:38:03.280]   and Jesus paid the penalty, and so therefore, you will no longer be punished.
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:06.280]   And many people think the gospel is that.
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.280]   We're not going to be punished.
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:11.280]   So therefore, we're going to go to heaven and experience eternity.
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:13.280]   Well, that's part of it.
[00:38:13.280 --> 00:38:17.280]   He said that our very nature changes.
[00:38:17.280 --> 00:38:19.280]   That we are partakers of the divine nature.
[00:38:19.280 --> 00:38:22.280]   So he didn't just save us from the penalty,
[00:38:22.280 --> 00:38:27.280]   but he also saved us from the result and the life that comes with this sin.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:29.280]   Our very nature has changed.
[00:38:29.280 --> 00:38:32.280]   We were children of darkness, now we are children of the light.
[00:38:32.280 --> 00:38:39.280]   And in that divine nature, the central character of that divine nature is love.
[00:38:39.280 --> 00:38:44.280]   Central character of that divine nature, of the new citizen, is love.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:46.280]   Colossians 3.14 is beyond all these things.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:51.280]   Beyond everything else, he says, "Put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity."
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:56.280]   And then again, Romans 13.10, he said, "Love does no wrong to a neighbor.
[00:38:56.280 --> 00:38:59.280]   Therefore, love is a fulfillment of the law."
[00:38:59.280 --> 00:39:03.280]   When Jesus was asked, "What is the greatest commandment?"
[00:39:03.280 --> 00:39:07.280]   The Pharisees and the scribes were constantly debating with one another
[00:39:07.280 --> 00:39:11.280]   because they were OCD about obeying the law.
[00:39:11.280 --> 00:39:13.280]   And they were dissecting every single law.
[00:39:13.280 --> 00:39:16.280]   Which is the greatest? Who's the most holy?
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:18.280]   Who's keeping the law most perfectly?
[00:39:18.280 --> 00:39:20.280]   And so they asked Jesus, "What's the greatest law?"
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.280]   And Jesus says, "All of the law is summarized in these two commandments.
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:27.280]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:39:27.280 --> 00:39:29.280]   and then love your neighbor as yourself."
[00:39:29.280 --> 00:39:33.280]   Those two laws summarize all the laws.
[00:39:33.280 --> 00:39:35.280]   Everything that God has taught the nation of Israel,
[00:39:35.280 --> 00:39:38.280]   everything that God has taught us as Christians,
[00:39:38.280 --> 00:39:40.280]   are summarized by these two laws.
[00:39:40.280 --> 00:39:42.280]   Love the Lord your God with all your heart,
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.280]   and love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:39:46.280 --> 00:39:51.280]   Now why--when we talk about this, about the love,
[00:39:51.280 --> 00:39:54.280]   we can easily think, "Well, that's easy."
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:57.280]   Being holy is hard, right?
[00:39:57.280 --> 00:40:01.280]   Not do this and do that, don't touch this, don't watch this.
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:05.280]   And so oftentimes we think that being spiritually mature
[00:40:05.280 --> 00:40:09.280]   means that we need to practice holiness,
[00:40:09.280 --> 00:40:11.280]   and we need to be moral,
[00:40:11.280 --> 00:40:13.280]   and there's things we need to do, things we don't need to do.
[00:40:13.280 --> 00:40:16.280]   And the Bible does give us instructions to do that.
[00:40:16.280 --> 00:40:18.280]   But he says all of the things that he has said
[00:40:18.280 --> 00:40:20.280]   is summarized in these two commandments.
[00:40:20.280 --> 00:40:23.280]   Love God and love your neighbor.
[00:40:23.280 --> 00:40:29.280]   There is nothing more sanctifying than the practice of biblical love.
[00:40:29.280 --> 00:40:34.280]   There is nothing that kills your natural self
[00:40:34.280 --> 00:40:37.280]   than practicing this biblical love.
[00:40:37.280 --> 00:40:40.280]   There is nothing more humiliating,
[00:40:40.280 --> 00:40:42.280]   there is nothing more humbling,
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:48.280]   there is nothing more emptying than the practice of biblical love.
[00:40:48.280 --> 00:40:51.280]   Matthew 16, 24 says, "If anyone wishes to come after me,
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:55.280]   he must deny himself, take up the cross, and follow me."
[00:40:55.280 --> 00:40:59.280]   Nothing requires the picking up of the cross
[00:40:59.280 --> 00:41:04.280]   and denying of yourself more than the practice of this love.
[00:41:04.280 --> 00:41:09.280]   Now some of us may say, "Well, I practice love.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:12.280]   I love my mom, I love my dad, I have a lot of friends.
[00:41:12.280 --> 00:41:15.280]   I have a lot of friends. I love my church people,
[00:41:15.280 --> 00:41:18.280]   I love my grandparents, I have many friends.
[00:41:18.280 --> 00:41:21.280]   So I practice this love, so I'm good."
[00:41:21.280 --> 00:41:24.280]   The scripture tells us, and the text that we're looking at,
[00:41:24.280 --> 00:41:27.280]   it says if you practice, if your love is limited to that,
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.280]   it says even the sinners practice that.
[00:41:29.280 --> 00:41:32.280]   Tell me somebody who doesn't practice that.
[00:41:32.280 --> 00:41:34.280]   Tell me somebody who doesn't love their mom or dad.
[00:41:34.280 --> 00:41:40.280]   I'm generalizing, but that's not unique to Christians.
[00:41:40.280 --> 00:41:44.280]   Who has friends? That's not unique to Christians.
[00:41:44.280 --> 00:41:47.280]   The kind of love that he tells us to love
[00:41:47.280 --> 00:41:51.280]   can only be understood and practiced
[00:41:51.280 --> 00:41:54.280]   if God has changed your divine nature,
[00:41:54.280 --> 00:41:55.280]   if your ears are open.
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.280]   That's why verse 27 begins by saying,
[00:41:58.280 --> 00:42:02.280]   "But I say to you who hear."
[00:42:02.280 --> 00:42:06.280]   Is there somebody here that doesn't hear what I'm saying?
[00:42:06.280 --> 00:42:08.280]   I mean, everybody has ears.
[00:42:08.280 --> 00:42:11.280]   He's not talking about those who are not deaf.
[00:42:11.280 --> 00:42:13.280]   And he would often say, when he would say something important,
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:17.280]   "He who has," what? "Ears, let him hear."
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:20.280]   Was he looking at the crowd and saw some people without ears?
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:23.280]   And saying, like, only those who have physical ears
[00:42:23.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   can listen to what I'm saying.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   Obviously, that's not what he's saying.
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:30.280]   He's saying, if your heart is not bent toward Christ,
[00:42:30.280 --> 00:42:32.280]   if you're not interested in what he has to say,
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:33.280]   you're not going to not only,
[00:42:33.280 --> 00:42:35.280]   not only are you not going to understand it,
[00:42:35.280 --> 00:42:38.280]   you have no intention of applying this.
[00:42:38.280 --> 00:42:43.280]   Because what he calls us to do as Christians
[00:42:43.280 --> 00:42:47.280]   in our natural state is impossible.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:52.280]   In fact, it's ridiculous to even expect this.
[00:42:52.280 --> 00:42:55.280]   The world will not look at somebody who practices this
[00:42:55.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   as somebody wise.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:00.280]   You're a fool.
[00:43:00.280 --> 00:43:03.280]   Somebody who's trying to harm you,
[00:43:03.280 --> 00:43:06.280]   somebody who has a history of hating you,
[00:43:06.280 --> 00:43:10.280]   and then you're deciding to love them,
[00:43:10.280 --> 00:43:14.280]   let alone not retaliate?
[00:43:14.280 --> 00:43:18.280]   The love that he calls us to love can only be understood
[00:43:18.280 --> 00:43:21.280]   if there was already the Holy Spirit,
[00:43:21.280 --> 00:43:24.280]   this divine nature that has been given to you
[00:43:24.280 --> 00:43:26.280]   where your ears became open,
[00:43:26.280 --> 00:43:30.280]   and you understand why he's saying this.
[00:43:30.280 --> 00:43:35.280]   He says, he begins by saying, "Love," who?
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:36.280]   He doesn't just say love.
[00:43:36.280 --> 00:43:37.280]   He says, "Love," who?
[00:43:37.280 --> 00:43:41.280]   Your enemies, right?
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:43.280]   Now, you have to understand who the enemies are.
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:46.280]   The enemies are not people who are irritating, right?
[00:43:46.280 --> 00:43:49.280]   It's hard to love people who are irritating.
[00:43:49.280 --> 00:43:52.280]   They say things that you don't want to hear.
[00:43:52.280 --> 00:43:55.280]   It's hard to love people who are different than you.
[00:43:55.280 --> 00:43:58.280]   It's hard to love people who are not responsible.
[00:43:58.280 --> 00:44:02.280]   It's hard to love people who are weird.
[00:44:02.280 --> 00:44:05.280]   But that's not who he's talking about.
[00:44:05.280 --> 00:44:07.280]   He's talking about your enemy.
[00:44:07.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   An enemy is somebody who is willfully out to hurt you.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.280]   They rejoice when bad things happen to you.
[00:44:15.280 --> 00:44:16.280]   That's an enemy.
[00:44:16.280 --> 00:44:19.280]   An enemy isn't just somebody that you have a hard time relating to.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:24.280]   An enemy isn't just somebody whose speech is difficult to swallow.
[00:44:24.280 --> 00:44:29.280]   He's talking about somebody who is willfully trying to hurt you.
[00:44:29.280 --> 00:44:34.280]   So think how difficult it is to hear this.
[00:44:34.280 --> 00:44:35.280]   I mean, think about it.
[00:44:35.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   Jesus is speaking, and in his disciples,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:41.280]   there was a zealot among them.
[00:44:41.280 --> 00:44:43.280]   And remember we talked about Simon the Zealot.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:52.280]   The zealots prided themselves of willing to die in the context of killing their enemies.
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:53.280]   And that was their virtue.
[00:44:53.280 --> 00:44:58.280]   And the person who was willing to do more harm than anybody else, that was your leader.
[00:44:58.280 --> 00:45:00.280]   That's a zealot.
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:03.280]   Now, that wasn't unique only to the zealot.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:08.280]   Israelites believed that when God came, that he's going to punish their enemies.
[00:45:08.280 --> 00:45:10.280]   He's going to wipe them out.
[00:45:10.280 --> 00:45:15.280]   These Romans who have come and suppress them so that they can't have a good life.
[00:45:15.280 --> 00:45:17.280]   They're second-class citizens.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:20.280]   If God comes, he's going to wipe them out.
[00:45:20.280 --> 00:45:24.280]   And that's why they were waiting for the Messiah.
[00:45:24.280 --> 00:45:30.280]   Not only that, remember, there was Matthew the tax collector in their midst.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:36.280]   And you have the fishermen who this guy was taking advantage of and taking their money.
[00:45:36.280 --> 00:45:38.280]   And this is money coming out of their pocket,
[00:45:38.280 --> 00:45:40.280]   money that they could have used to take care of their children.
[00:45:40.280 --> 00:45:43.280]   And that guy is sitting in their midst.
[00:45:43.280 --> 00:45:47.280]   So imagine when Jesus says, "Love your enemies."
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:52.280]   I think there was an immediate practical application even among his disciples.
[00:45:52.280 --> 00:45:57.280]   That even among them, he's not just talking generality, he's talking to something specific within them.
[00:45:57.280 --> 00:46:04.280]   That if you want to be my disciple, you must practice this love.
[00:46:04.280 --> 00:46:07.280]   Easy to say, right?
[00:46:07.280 --> 00:46:10.280]   Easy to be up in a pulpit and say, "Love your enemies."
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:13.280]   It sounds great. It sounds noble.
[00:46:13.280 --> 00:46:20.280]   But if you've ever even attempted to love somebody that is trying to harm you,
[00:46:20.280 --> 00:46:23.280]   you know how impossible that is.
[00:46:23.280 --> 00:46:26.280]   Because we don't wrestle with loving our enemies.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.280]   We wrestle with not taking vengeance.
[00:46:30.280 --> 00:46:35.280]   We wrestle with, if they harmed us, oh man, I want to teach them a lesson.
[00:46:35.280 --> 00:46:38.280]   I want to teach them a lesson so bad.
[00:46:38.280 --> 00:46:43.280]   So to even think that we're going to move from that to love them and care for them,
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:49.280]   is unimaginable because it's rarely practiced.
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:53.280]   The love that he calls us to love is an agape love.
[00:46:53.280 --> 00:46:55.280]   The Bible uses many different words for love,
[00:46:55.280 --> 00:46:59.280]   but the love that he's referring to is a covenantal love.
[00:46:59.280 --> 00:47:02.280]   And the closest thing that you and I can think of as a covenantal love
[00:47:02.280 --> 00:47:05.280]   is when a husband and wife get married,
[00:47:05.280 --> 00:47:08.280]   you make a promise that I'm going to love and respect, sacrifice,
[00:47:08.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   in what? Enrich her for poorer, sickness and in health,
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:15.280]   till death do us part.
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:19.280]   Good or bad.
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:26.280]   Not, I will love and honor and support and sacrifice as long as they deserve it.
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:31.280]   And that would be an honest confession to how we practice love.
[00:47:31.280 --> 00:47:33.280]   Right? In most circles.
[00:47:33.280 --> 00:47:36.280]   I will love and honor and sacrifice as long as you don't tick me off,
[00:47:36.280 --> 00:47:40.280]   as long as you do your part, I'll do my part.
[00:47:40.280 --> 00:47:44.280]   But that's not what we say when we enter into this covenant relationship.
[00:47:44.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   When we enter into this covenant relationship, it says when things are good and when things are bad.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   When we're poor or when we're rich.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:47:58.280]   We make this covenant relationship meaning that I'm going to love you,
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.280]   whether you deserve it or not. And two people enter this covenant relationship.
[00:48:02.280 --> 00:48:05.280]   And that's what a covenant, that's what he calls us to love.
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:10.280]   He says to love, but not just anybody, not just your wife, but your enemy.
[00:48:10.280 --> 00:48:17.280]   In John 13, 34-35, he tells us that that central identifying mark
[00:48:17.280 --> 00:48:21.280]   between a non-Christian and a Christian is what?
[00:48:21.280 --> 00:48:26.280]   Not what you do or don't do, not if you do quiet time or not what church you belong to.
[00:48:26.280 --> 00:48:31.280]   He said the central identifying mark of a Christian is what? Love.
[00:48:31.280 --> 00:48:36.280]   A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you,
[00:48:36.280 --> 00:48:40.280]   that you also love one another. By this all men will know that you are my disciples,
[00:48:40.280 --> 00:48:43.280]   if you have love for one another.
[00:48:43.280 --> 00:48:46.280]   Now he says that this is a new commandment.
[00:48:46.280 --> 00:48:50.280]   Now how is this a new commandment? Because we see something similar in the Old Testament.
[00:48:50.280 --> 00:48:54.280]   In Leviticus 19, 18, he says, "You shall not take vengeance nor bear any grudge
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.280]   against the sons of your people, but you shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:48:57.280 --> 00:49:02.280]   I am the Lord." Was Jesus not aware of Leviticus?
[00:49:02.280 --> 00:49:07.280]   Did Jesus forget that this was already said in the Old Testament?
[00:49:07.280 --> 00:49:10.280]   Why does he say this is a new commandment?
[00:49:10.280 --> 00:49:15.280]   He says the new commandment in the stipulation that makes this a new commandment,
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:20.280]   he says that love as what? As I have loved you.
[00:49:20.280 --> 00:49:24.280]   That's what makes a new commandment. It's not just any love.
[00:49:24.280 --> 00:49:28.280]   It's not loving people who are deserving. It's not loving people who are easy to love.
[00:49:28.280 --> 00:49:33.280]   It's not loving people who reciprocate. But he says, "As I have loved you."
[00:49:33.280 --> 00:49:36.280]   And what is this love?
[00:49:36.280 --> 00:49:41.280]   Sagape, covenantal love. Despite love.
[00:49:41.280 --> 00:49:45.280]   Natural love will not love anyone that's difficult.
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:51.280]   Think about it. We don't have to search the scriptures deeply to know this.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:57.280]   Look at our own lives. If they're difficult, especially if you're a Christian,
[00:49:57.280 --> 00:50:03.280]   there's Christian-y things that we say to make what we do godly.
[00:50:03.280 --> 00:50:06.280]   We can't be friends with everybody.
[00:50:06.280 --> 00:50:11.280]   And so it becomes like, these are friends and these are acquaintances.
[00:50:11.280 --> 00:50:15.280]   So friends are people that we love, we care for, we invite into the house.
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:18.280]   Acquaintances are people that we don't get along with.
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:21.280]   We've got to stiff-arm them.
[00:50:21.280 --> 00:50:27.280]   And so natural love will never practice love to love people who are difficult.
[00:50:27.280 --> 00:50:31.280]   Natural love will not love anyone that won't reciprocate.
[00:50:31.280 --> 00:50:35.280]   I can practice love for a while, but if you don't reciprocate,
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:40.280]   if you don't appreciate what I'm doing, eventually you become an acquaintance.
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:45.280]   I'm not going to pour my life into it. I've done that, but you didn't reciprocate.
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:50.280]   And at some point, so I'll tolerate for a while, for a month, for two months,
[00:50:50.280 --> 00:50:54.280]   or maybe even a year, but you never reciprocate, so you don't deserve this love.
[00:50:54.280 --> 00:50:59.280]   Natural love will never practice love to those who don't reciprocate.
[00:50:59.280 --> 00:51:02.280]   Natural love will not love anyone that's different.
[00:51:02.280 --> 00:51:07.280]   And that's why we gather around ourselves people who are like us.
[00:51:07.280 --> 00:51:11.280]   They speak like us. They talk like us. They're financially like us.
[00:51:11.280 --> 00:51:15.280]   And so we surround ourselves with people that are easier to love.
[00:51:15.280 --> 00:51:20.280]   And so we practice love the way the rest of the world loves,
[00:51:20.280 --> 00:51:25.280]   and so we think that we're practicing the biblical love.
[00:51:25.280 --> 00:51:33.280]   The natural love, if it's difficult to do that, will never love your enemy.
[00:51:33.280 --> 00:51:37.280]   Every fiber of our being will fight against it.
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   In fact, it almost sounds like, "Jesus could not have meant that."
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:48.280]   Enemy? I can't even love people who are difficult.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:54.280]   If there's a possibility that you might hurt me, that's enough.
[00:51:54.280 --> 00:51:57.280]   That's enough for me to stiff-arm you.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:04.280]   Many of you have come from churches where you've been hurt.
[00:52:04.280 --> 00:52:08.280]   And as a result of that, you have a defense mechanism.
[00:52:08.280 --> 00:52:11.280]   "I can't be hurt again."
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:15.280]   So as a result of that, you have made lines.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.280]   People that I can love, people I can't love.
[00:52:18.280 --> 00:52:23.280]   If there's a possibility that you might hurt me, I can't practice this love.
[00:52:23.280 --> 00:52:28.280]   You can be my acquaintance, but I can't practice this love.
[00:52:28.280 --> 00:52:31.280]   Loving your enemy challenges that.
[00:52:31.280 --> 00:52:34.280]   It challenges that.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:37.280]   Because he didn't just say, "Hey, take a risk."
[00:52:37.280 --> 00:52:42.280]   He said, "No, the people who are already hurting you to love them."
[00:52:42.280 --> 00:52:45.280]   Naturally speaking, this is ridiculous. It must be a hyperbole.
[00:52:45.280 --> 00:52:50.280]   God doesn't really expect us to practice this.
[00:52:50.280 --> 00:52:53.280]   Not only does he expect us to practice this, he says,
[00:52:53.280 --> 00:52:56.280]   "This is the identifying mark of a Christian."
[00:52:56.280 --> 00:53:01.280]   There's nothing more that surprises the secular world
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:06.280]   than when they see God's people practice this love.
[00:53:06.280 --> 00:53:10.280]   Because they don't see this anywhere else in the world.
[00:53:10.280 --> 00:53:14.280]   This is supernatural. This is something that you cannot practice.
[00:53:14.280 --> 00:53:18.280]   You will not practice. They won't even praise you if you practice it.
[00:53:18.280 --> 00:53:22.280]   This love is not of this world.
[00:53:22.280 --> 00:53:25.280]   In fact, Paul even himself says,
[00:53:25.280 --> 00:53:28.280]   "God demonstrates his love in this agape love."
[00:53:28.280 --> 00:53:32.280]   Romans 5, 6-11, "For while we were still helpless,
[00:53:32.280 --> 00:53:35.280]   at the right time Christ died for us."
[00:53:35.280 --> 00:53:37.280]   While we were yet helpless.
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.280]   Verse 8, "But God demonstrates his own love toward us,
[00:53:40.280 --> 00:53:44.280]   in that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us."
[00:53:44.280 --> 00:53:48.280]   Verse 10, "For while we were enemies,
[00:53:48.280 --> 00:53:52.280]   we were reconciled to God through the death of his Son."
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:56.280]   While we were helpless, while we were sinners,
[00:53:56.280 --> 00:54:00.280]   and while we were his enemies.
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:05.280]   We were created to be image bearers of God.
[00:54:05.280 --> 00:54:09.280]   And when Adam and Eve and all their descendants
[00:54:09.280 --> 00:54:13.280]   rebelled against God, how does the Bible describe our fall?
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:18.280]   All have sinned and what? Fall short of the glory of God.
[00:54:18.280 --> 00:54:21.280]   God's glory will no longer shine on sinners.
[00:54:21.280 --> 00:54:25.280]   We no longer reflect who God is.
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:29.280]   So when Christ comes and he restores that glory,
[00:54:29.280 --> 00:54:34.280]   now we are back to what God intended to be his image bearers.
[00:54:34.280 --> 00:54:40.280]   And what is the image that God desires us to bear more than any other image?
[00:54:40.280 --> 00:54:44.280]   It's his love. His love.
[00:54:44.280 --> 00:54:49.280]   When we reflect the cross, we bear his image.
[00:54:49.280 --> 00:54:53.280]   In that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:54:53.280 --> 00:54:57.280]   There's nothing more sanctifying in life.
[00:54:57.280 --> 00:54:59.280]   There's nothing more humbling.
[00:54:59.280 --> 00:55:02.280]   There's nothing that breaks us more
[00:55:02.280 --> 00:55:06.280]   than to even attempt to practice this love.
[00:55:06.280 --> 00:55:09.280]   He begins by saying, "Love your enemies."
[00:55:09.280 --> 00:55:13.280]   And then he tells us what that's going to look like.
[00:55:13.280 --> 00:55:18.280]   So what he says from verse 27 down about what you ought to do,
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:21.280]   you will never see it anywhere else.
[00:55:21.280 --> 00:55:23.280]   You'll never see it anywhere else.
[00:55:23.280 --> 00:55:28.280]   You'll see like other religions that the good balances the bad
[00:55:28.280 --> 00:55:32.280]   or fight against your enemy and how to conquer them
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.280]   and how to receive blessing.
[00:55:35.280 --> 00:55:40.280]   But to love your enemies, to turn the other cheek,
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.280]   and this is what he did for us, he says.
[00:55:45.280 --> 00:55:47.280]   So we are to reflect his glory and say,
[00:55:47.280 --> 00:55:50.280]   "Oh, you know, like spiritual people are people who know the Bible.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:52.280]   Spiritual people who are disciplined.
[00:55:52.280 --> 00:55:55.280]   Spiritual people who bear fruit.
[00:55:55.280 --> 00:56:00.280]   Mature people are the ones who have know-how and are the disciples."
[00:56:00.280 --> 00:56:01.280]   That's not what the Bible says.
[00:56:01.280 --> 00:56:03.280]   All these things are important things,
[00:56:03.280 --> 00:56:06.280]   but the central thing that God looks at,
[00:56:06.280 --> 00:56:09.280]   that he wants us to reflect more than any other character,
[00:56:09.280 --> 00:56:16.280]   is to love our enemies, to love difficult people,
[00:56:16.280 --> 00:56:20.280]   because there's no benefit to you.
[00:56:20.280 --> 00:56:24.280]   You're not doing it because they're going to reciprocate one day.
[00:56:24.280 --> 00:56:30.280]   You're not doing it because somehow there's benefit or glory that comes to you.
[00:56:30.280 --> 00:56:34.280]   We simply do it because he did it for us,
[00:56:34.280 --> 00:56:38.280]   because we're his image bearers.
[00:56:38.280 --> 00:56:42.280]   First thing that he says to us, just in case we superficially says,
[00:56:42.280 --> 00:56:44.280]   "Oh, yeah, yeah, I love your enemies."
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:48.280]   And oftentimes what we think of loving our enemies is not hating them.
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:52.280]   I'm not going to hate them, and I'm not going to go and slash their tires,
[00:56:52.280 --> 00:56:56.280]   and, you know, so I'm loving them.
[00:56:56.280 --> 00:57:00.280]   Well, he explains to us the application of this.
[00:57:00.280 --> 00:57:08.280]   First place, he says, "To do good to those who hate you."
[00:57:08.280 --> 00:57:12.280]   Like I said, if you've ever tried to love anybody,
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.280]   if you've ever tried to be around, even be around somebody
[00:57:15.280 --> 00:57:20.280]   who you feel like were against you,
[00:57:20.280 --> 00:57:24.280]   your struggle wasn't to do good for them.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:29.280]   Your struggle was to not to hit them back.
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.280]   They harmed you.
[00:57:31.280 --> 00:57:34.280]   Your struggle wasn't like, "What good can I do for them?"
[00:57:34.280 --> 00:57:39.280]   Our struggle was, "How do I let them know that they're not going to get away with this?
[00:57:39.280 --> 00:57:41.280]   How do I do this?"
[00:57:41.280 --> 00:57:43.280]   That's what we struggle with.
[00:57:43.280 --> 00:57:48.280]   And if you're self-controlled enough, and if you're godly enough,
[00:57:48.280 --> 00:57:53.280]   that I'm not going to harm you the way you deserve,
[00:57:53.280 --> 00:57:55.280]   because you're a righteous man.
[00:57:55.280 --> 00:57:56.280]   You're a holy man.
[00:57:56.280 --> 00:57:58.280]   You're a godly man.
[00:57:58.280 --> 00:58:01.280]   But his love calls us beyond that.
[00:58:01.280 --> 00:58:04.280]   And I've mentioned this before,
[00:58:04.280 --> 00:58:08.280]   the distinction between justice, mercy, and grace,
[00:58:08.280 --> 00:58:13.280]   because you and I have a hard time in our flesh to practice even justice.
[00:58:13.280 --> 00:58:17.280]   If somebody smacks me on my left cheek, right,
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:19.280]   he said, "Turn the other cheek."
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:21.280]   Are you kidding? Turn the other cheek?
[00:58:21.280 --> 00:58:24.280]   I'm going to learn some MMA and put you in an arm bar.
[00:58:24.280 --> 00:58:27.280]   I'm not going to let you tap out.
[00:58:27.280 --> 00:58:30.280]   Once I break your arm, I'm going to break your neck, break your knees, break your--
[00:58:30.280 --> 00:58:33.280]   Was that too violent?
[00:58:33.280 --> 00:58:35.280]   You know it's true.
[00:58:35.280 --> 00:58:37.280]   Because that's what we struggle with.
[00:58:37.280 --> 00:58:38.280]   We struggle with this.
[00:58:38.280 --> 00:58:43.280]   If you slap me, I'm going to make sure that you know what you did was wrong.
[00:58:43.280 --> 00:58:45.280]   I'm going to put you in your place.
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.280]   I'm going to try not to kill you,
[00:58:47.280 --> 00:58:50.280]   but I'm going to harm you enough so that you never do this again.
[00:58:50.280 --> 00:58:53.280]   And I need to do this so that you don't go around hurting other people,
[00:58:53.280 --> 00:58:56.280]   so I'm actually doing God's work.
[00:58:56.280 --> 00:58:59.280]   Because that's what we struggle with.
[00:58:59.280 --> 00:59:01.280]   That's justice.
[00:59:01.280 --> 00:59:06.280]   In the Old Testament, God restricts our justice
[00:59:06.280 --> 00:59:12.280]   because it is our natural inclination to go beyond justice.
[00:59:12.280 --> 00:59:16.280]   You hurt my daughter, I kill your family.
[00:59:16.280 --> 00:59:19.280]   You bomb our village, I destroy your nation.
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:22.280]   So he says eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth.
[00:59:22.280 --> 00:59:27.280]   So he puts justice--so that you can practice justice.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.280]   The next level is mercy.
[00:59:29.280 --> 00:59:33.280]   Mercy is even though you are wrong, you don't retaliate at all.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:38.280]   Mercy is not giving back what we deserve.
[00:59:38.280 --> 00:59:42.280]   So even though they may deserve justice,
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:45.280]   you choose to withhold and not to harm them.
[00:59:45.280 --> 00:59:47.280]   That's mercy.
[00:59:47.280 --> 00:59:51.280]   Even though you're a good man, a self-controlled man,
[00:59:51.280 --> 00:59:54.280]   a truly religious man,
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:57.280]   you may do your best to practice mercy.
[00:59:57.280 --> 01:00:00.280]   But what he calls us to do is beyond that.
[01:00:00.280 --> 01:00:04.280]   Grace is receiving what you don't deserve.
[01:00:04.280 --> 01:00:08.280]   God is perfectly in his place to practice justice,
[01:00:08.280 --> 01:00:11.280]   and if he practiced justice with us, you and I wouldn't be here.
[01:00:11.280 --> 01:00:16.280]   He is perfectly just to destroy every single human being
[01:00:16.280 --> 01:00:17.280]   who rebelled against him.
[01:00:17.280 --> 01:00:22.280]   So that would be perfectly just, to send all of us to hell.
[01:00:22.280 --> 01:00:25.280]   Who are we to question a sovereign God?
[01:00:25.280 --> 01:00:29.280]   And what--even if you think it's unfair, what are you going to do about it?
[01:00:29.280 --> 01:00:31.280]   He's God.
[01:00:31.280 --> 01:00:33.280]   The very reason why you and I woke up today
[01:00:33.280 --> 01:00:37.280]   is because he allowed enough oxygen to come into our nostrils.
[01:00:37.280 --> 01:00:40.280]   And if he chose not to do that,
[01:00:40.280 --> 01:00:43.280]   if he stopped sustaining the universe,
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:48.280]   all he had to do was just stop, and you and I would die.
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:51.280]   And he would have been perfectly just.
[01:00:51.280 --> 01:00:56.280]   He would have been perfectly merciful without bringing justice.
[01:00:56.280 --> 01:00:58.280]   And to say, "You know what? God could have destroyed them,
[01:00:58.280 --> 01:01:02.280]   but he's not destroying us. He's just allowing us to live."
[01:01:02.280 --> 01:01:05.280]   But he calls us to practice grace.
[01:01:05.280 --> 01:01:07.280]   Not only did he forgive us of our sins,
[01:01:07.280 --> 01:01:11.280]   he says he has made us his adopted children.
[01:01:11.280 --> 01:01:13.280]   We're co-heirs with Christ.
[01:01:13.280 --> 01:01:15.280]   We have been adopted into his family,
[01:01:15.280 --> 01:01:19.280]   and he calls us to enter this throne of what?
[01:01:19.280 --> 01:01:22.280]   Throne of justice? Throne of mercy?
[01:01:22.280 --> 01:01:24.280]   Throne of grace.
[01:01:24.280 --> 01:01:28.280]   That in times of struggle to come, seek him out.
[01:01:28.280 --> 01:01:30.280]   People who are rebellious, people who are helpless,
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:34.280]   people who are sinners, people who are enemies at one point.
[01:01:34.280 --> 01:01:40.280]   He practiced this grace, and this is what he calls us to do.
[01:01:40.280 --> 01:01:42.280]   Now, I want to qualify here,
[01:01:42.280 --> 01:01:44.280]   because whenever we talk about the idea of grace,
[01:01:44.280 --> 01:01:48.280]   we practice a worldly understanding of grace.
[01:01:48.280 --> 01:01:51.280]   So people think that practicing grace means
[01:01:51.280 --> 01:01:54.280]   that when people are sinning and do whatever they want,
[01:01:54.280 --> 01:01:57.280]   we turn the other way, and we sweep it under the rug,
[01:01:57.280 --> 01:01:59.280]   and we think that that's grace.
[01:01:59.280 --> 01:02:03.280]   You would never do that to somebody you truly love.
[01:02:03.280 --> 01:02:08.280]   If somebody, your mother, father, brother, sister, and your children
[01:02:08.280 --> 01:02:14.280]   are headed toward the path that's going to harm them and destroy them,
[01:02:14.280 --> 01:02:18.280]   you don't say, "You know what? I want to practice grace.
[01:02:18.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   And I'm not going to say anything.
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   I'm just going to let them be."
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:26.280]   Would you say that that's gracious?
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:28.280]   No, that's indifference.
[01:02:28.280 --> 01:02:30.280]   That's not grace,
[01:02:30.280 --> 01:02:34.280]   because you would not do that to somebody you truly love.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:35.280]   I don't want to get my hands dirty.
[01:02:35.280 --> 01:02:37.280]   I don't want them getting mad at me,
[01:02:37.280 --> 01:02:40.280]   because I know if I say this, that they're going to say I'm a jerk.
[01:02:40.280 --> 01:02:42.280]   So let's just practice grace.
[01:02:42.280 --> 01:02:44.280]   That's not grace.
[01:02:44.280 --> 01:02:47.280]   That's indifference.
[01:02:47.280 --> 01:02:51.280]   Sometimes practicing grace means to say difficult things.
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:57.280]   Sometimes practicing grace would cause them to dislike you even further.
[01:02:57.280 --> 01:03:02.280]   Sometimes practicing grace means to speak the truth in love.
[01:03:02.280 --> 01:03:08.280]   Nevertheless, he calls us to practice this grace in Romans 12, 17-21.
[01:03:08.280 --> 01:03:10.280]   "Never pay back evil to anyone.
[01:03:10.280 --> 01:03:14.280]   Respect what is right in the sight of all men, if possible,
[01:03:14.280 --> 01:03:16.280]   so far as it depends on you.
[01:03:16.280 --> 01:03:19.280]   Be at peace with all men.
[01:03:19.280 --> 01:03:22.280]   Never take your own revenge, beloved, but leave room for the wrath of God,
[01:03:22.280 --> 01:03:27.280]   for it is written, 'Vengeance is mine. I will repay,' says the Lord.
[01:03:27.280 --> 01:03:30.280]   But if your enemy is hungry, feed him.
[01:03:30.280 --> 01:03:33.280]   If he is thirsty, give him a drink.
[01:03:33.280 --> 01:03:36.280]   For in so doing, you will heap burning coals on his head.
[01:03:36.280 --> 01:03:40.280]   Do not overcome evil, but overcome evil with good.
[01:03:40.280 --> 01:03:44.280]   Do not be overcome by evil."
[01:03:44.280 --> 01:03:49.280]   Not only to not hate them, he said to feed them.
[01:03:49.280 --> 01:03:56.280]   Not only don't retaliate, he said give them a drink.
[01:03:56.280 --> 01:04:03.280]   He said repay their evil with good.
[01:04:03.280 --> 01:04:07.280]   Tell me that that doesn't stir you up.
[01:04:07.280 --> 01:04:11.280]   If you've never made an attempt to even practice this,
[01:04:11.280 --> 01:04:16.280]   you're just going to hear it kind of like, "Nah, this can't be serious."
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:20.280]   Because you know how difficult this is.
[01:04:20.280 --> 01:04:23.280]   This will destroy you.
[01:04:23.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   Loving somebody that is trying to harm you will destroy you.
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:33.280]   It will eat you up.
[01:04:33.280 --> 01:04:36.280]   You can't sleep at night.
[01:04:36.280 --> 01:04:43.280]   Even the thought of doing good to somebody who is actively wanting harm in your life,
[01:04:43.280 --> 01:04:47.280]   and to even contemplate, "How am I going to do good for them?
[01:04:47.280 --> 01:04:50.280]   How can I feed them? How can I care for them?"
[01:04:50.280 --> 01:04:57.280]   It will kill you.
[01:04:57.280 --> 01:05:02.280]   But that thing that dies in the context of trying to kill,
[01:05:02.280 --> 01:05:11.280]   in the context of trying to love somebody who hates you, must die.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:15.280]   And that's exactly why he calls us to do it.
[01:05:15.280 --> 01:05:22.280]   That thing which causes us to stiff-arm people,
[01:05:22.280 --> 01:05:28.280]   to hate people who hate us, must first die.
[01:05:28.280 --> 01:05:34.280]   So when Jesus says, "He who finds this life will lose it."
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.280]   He who practices love like the rest of the world,
[01:05:37.280 --> 01:05:40.280]   that love people who are lovable,
[01:05:40.280 --> 01:05:43.280]   who are easy to love,
[01:05:43.280 --> 01:05:46.280]   eventually, if that's the only kind of love you practice,
[01:05:46.280 --> 01:05:52.280]   eventually you will see what that does to your marriage.
[01:05:52.280 --> 01:05:55.280]   You will see what that does to your children.
[01:05:55.280 --> 01:06:00.280]   You will see how long your friendship will last.
[01:06:00.280 --> 01:06:03.280]   You will see how long the church will go.
[01:06:03.280 --> 01:06:05.280]   You will see what kind of children that you will bear.
[01:06:05.280 --> 01:06:09.280]   You will see what kind of church fellowship you will have.
[01:06:09.280 --> 01:06:15.280]   If you only practice this love that the world practices.
[01:06:15.280 --> 01:06:19.280]   Because eventually, they're not going to be lovable.
[01:06:19.280 --> 01:06:24.280]   Eventually, you will say they don't deserve it.
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:30.280]   Eventually, you're not going to be satisfied in the way that they're responding.
[01:06:30.280 --> 01:06:32.280]   So the practice, this worldly kind of love,
[01:06:32.280 --> 01:06:37.280]   lasts for a period because it's self-centered.
[01:06:37.280 --> 01:06:42.280]   The love that he calls us to practice will kill us.
[01:06:42.280 --> 01:06:44.280]   It will humble us.
[01:06:44.280 --> 01:06:47.280]   It humiliates us.
[01:06:47.280 --> 01:06:51.280]   And it drives out any personal ambition that we hold on to.
[01:06:51.280 --> 01:06:53.280]   Any personal pride.
[01:06:53.280 --> 01:06:55.280]   Any desire to be recognized.
[01:06:55.280 --> 01:06:58.280]   Any desire to be seen.
[01:06:58.280 --> 01:07:06.280]   Any desire to be somebody will be killed.
[01:07:06.280 --> 01:07:14.280]   I remember years ago, while we were engaged in homeless ministry,
[01:07:14.280 --> 01:07:19.280]   when we first started engaging, God ignited a compassion in me.
[01:07:19.280 --> 01:07:23.280]   And I remember having conversations with the homeless and thinking,
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:26.280]   "That's somebody's brother.
[01:07:26.280 --> 01:07:27.280]   That's somebody's sister.
[01:07:27.280 --> 01:07:28.280]   That's somebody's son.
[01:07:28.280 --> 01:07:30.280]   That's somebody's daughter."
[01:07:30.280 --> 01:07:33.280]   And I began to see them with compassion.
[01:07:33.280 --> 01:07:37.280]   Because God allowed me to see them as people.
[01:07:37.280 --> 01:07:42.280]   At one point, they were somebody's beloved child in somebody's arm.
[01:07:42.280 --> 01:07:45.280]   Something happened in their life.
[01:07:45.280 --> 01:07:47.280]   At some point, they were somebody's brother that they played baseball with
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:51.280]   and soccer with.
[01:07:51.280 --> 01:07:52.280]   They got caught up in drugs.
[01:07:52.280 --> 01:07:54.280]   Something happened in their life, and they're out on the street.
[01:07:54.280 --> 01:07:56.280]   And God allowed me to have compassion for them.
[01:07:56.280 --> 01:07:59.280]   So I went out, and I tried to, you know, "Let's go.
[01:07:59.280 --> 01:08:04.280]   Let's go out and rally people to go out and help them."
[01:08:04.280 --> 01:08:11.280]   But after a while, that compassion started to dwindle away.
[01:08:11.280 --> 01:08:16.280]   Because as I started going out, and the money that I had to use --
[01:08:16.280 --> 01:08:19.280]   I mean, at that time, my full-time pay was $1,300.
[01:08:19.280 --> 01:08:25.280]   And every challenge every week was, "How can I feed 100 people with $50?"
[01:08:25.280 --> 01:08:28.280]   And I remember very specifically, you know, when we first started going out,
[01:08:28.280 --> 01:08:29.280]   it used to be called Price Club.
[01:08:29.280 --> 01:08:31.280]   Now it's Costco.
[01:08:31.280 --> 01:08:33.280]   And they used to have these Farmer John hot dogs.
[01:08:33.280 --> 01:08:37.280]   And these Farmer John hot dogs, you can get 50 of them for $4.95.
[01:08:37.280 --> 01:08:42.280]   And then I can get another can of hot chocolate that I can make a whole
[01:08:42.280 --> 01:08:46.280]   hot chocolate thing for another $4.95, right?
[01:08:46.280 --> 01:08:49.280]   So I bought enough of them, so $50, we were able to do that.
[01:08:49.280 --> 01:08:53.280]   It wasn't delicious, but it was just not for them to be hungry.
[01:08:53.280 --> 01:08:57.280]   And then I remember a lady in our church wanted to help,
[01:08:57.280 --> 01:09:00.280]   and so she would go collect old donuts, right?
[01:09:00.280 --> 01:09:02.280]   Before they throw it away, she would get a whole bucket of it.
[01:09:02.280 --> 01:09:06.280]   So that's what we fed every year for years and years, right?
[01:09:06.280 --> 01:09:12.280]   Farmer John hot dogs, hot chocolate, and stale donuts, right?
[01:09:12.280 --> 01:09:16.280]   And then I was like, "Oh, you know, winter is coming around,
[01:09:16.280 --> 01:09:17.280]   so it's going to get cold."
[01:09:17.280 --> 01:09:20.280]   So I started to collect used clothing that people would typically donate
[01:09:20.280 --> 01:09:21.280]   or throw away.
[01:09:21.280 --> 01:09:24.280]   So I started collecting that, and I would start laying it out.
[01:09:24.280 --> 01:09:28.280]   And that's when I really got into trouble because it started attracting
[01:09:28.280 --> 01:09:32.280]   a large crowd, and we would always run out of food.
[01:09:32.280 --> 01:09:35.280]   And then not only would we run out of food, we would run out of clothes.
[01:09:35.280 --> 01:09:38.280]   So all the good clothes, they would come and get it first.
[01:09:38.280 --> 01:09:44.280]   And then once it ran out, the benevolence would turn to frustration.
[01:09:44.280 --> 01:09:48.280]   And every week I went out, you would have the people in the front saying,
[01:09:48.280 --> 01:09:50.280]   "Thank you for coming, thank you for coming," but at the end,
[01:09:50.280 --> 01:09:53.280]   I would always get cussed out before we leave.
[01:09:53.280 --> 01:09:57.280]   And so every day we'd pack up our stuff with somebody cussing us out
[01:09:57.280 --> 01:10:00.280]   because we didn't have enough.
[01:10:00.280 --> 01:10:04.280]   And my compassion started to dwindle into bitterness.
[01:10:04.280 --> 01:10:09.280]   And at that time, even though it was $200, my full-time pay was $1,300,
[01:10:09.280 --> 01:10:12.280]   so $200 at that time was a lot of money for me.
[01:10:12.280 --> 01:10:15.280]   And I said, "Man, I'm sacrificing all of this to come out,
[01:10:15.280 --> 01:10:17.280]   and they're cussing me out."
[01:10:17.280 --> 01:10:21.280]   And then on top of that, the more time I spent with them,
[01:10:21.280 --> 01:10:24.280]   a lot of these people were not nice people.
[01:10:24.280 --> 01:10:27.280]   They're drug dealers.
[01:10:27.280 --> 01:10:33.280]   Some of them talked about raping girls like it was fun.
[01:10:33.280 --> 01:10:35.280]   And I'm sitting there listening to their conversation.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:40.280]   The longer I was out there, I mean, these aren't good guys.
[01:10:40.280 --> 01:10:42.280]   And this is dangerous.
[01:10:42.280 --> 01:10:46.280]   And I see young teenage girls get hooked on drugs.
[01:10:46.280 --> 01:10:50.280]   They come out, blonde hair, blue eye, like a high school cheerleader,
[01:10:50.280 --> 01:10:54.280]   and then six months later, you could see how their physical appearance
[01:10:54.280 --> 01:10:58.280]   was completely wrecked because of drugs,
[01:10:58.280 --> 01:11:02.280]   and they would have to sell their bodies just to stay safe and to get drugs.
[01:11:02.280 --> 01:11:07.280]   And I'm watching this, and I'm serving these people.
[01:11:07.280 --> 01:11:14.280]   And as more time went by, love went away.
[01:11:14.280 --> 01:11:16.280]   I had no compassion.
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.280]   But I had to keep doing it because I'm committed,
[01:11:18.280 --> 01:11:21.280]   because I got other people to come out with me.
[01:11:21.280 --> 01:11:24.280]   So I can't quit now.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:28.280]   But I remember as I was wrestling with this, thinking,
[01:11:28.280 --> 01:11:32.280]   "If I do it for them, I would have stopped
[01:11:32.280 --> 01:11:38.280]   because my love for them wasn't enough."
[01:11:38.280 --> 01:11:40.280]   If I went out thinking like, "Oh, I feel good.
[01:11:40.280 --> 01:11:45.280]   I feel like I'm doing something good," that also dried up.
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.280]   After the initial period, that also dried up.
[01:11:48.280 --> 01:11:53.280]   And I remember wrestling through that process
[01:11:53.280 --> 01:11:57.280]   where every time I would come before God and pray,
[01:11:57.280 --> 01:12:04.280]   I said, "Love them as I loved you."
[01:12:04.280 --> 01:12:11.280]   Man, every fiber of my being fought against that.
[01:12:11.280 --> 01:12:14.280]   Every fiber of my being.
[01:12:14.280 --> 01:12:18.280]   Now, I share you that because that's what I experienced
[01:12:18.280 --> 01:12:23.280]   out on the street.
[01:12:23.280 --> 01:12:36.280]   But to be more real, I struggle with that as a pastor.
[01:12:36.280 --> 01:12:38.280]   And that's the biggest struggle that I struggle with
[01:12:38.280 --> 01:12:42.280]   more than anything else as a pastor.
[01:12:42.280 --> 01:12:45.280]   I don't know how many times I tell myself,
[01:12:45.280 --> 01:12:52.280]   "I don't want to deal with this anymore."
[01:12:52.280 --> 01:12:56.280]   If I wasn't a pastor, I don't have to deal with this.
[01:12:56.280 --> 01:13:01.280]   So through the years, I wrestled with that thought.
[01:13:01.280 --> 01:13:04.280]   If I wasn't a pastor, I don't have to deal with this.
[01:13:04.280 --> 01:13:06.280]   Why do I have to deal with this?
[01:13:06.280 --> 01:13:09.280]   Why do I have to keep doing this?
[01:13:09.280 --> 01:13:13.280]   And every time I wrestle with that,
[01:13:13.280 --> 01:13:18.280]   I said, "Love them as I've loved you."
[01:13:18.280 --> 01:13:24.280]   When I think about loving people in my flesh,
[01:13:24.280 --> 01:13:27.280]   I don't have it in me.
[01:13:27.280 --> 01:13:29.280]   I don't have it in me.
[01:13:29.280 --> 01:13:32.280]   There's nothing deep inside that if I tap into it,
[01:13:32.280 --> 01:13:36.280]   somehow love is going to come out.
[01:13:36.280 --> 01:13:39.280]   The only way that I can practice this love
[01:13:39.280 --> 01:13:45.280]   is if the love of Christ compels me.
[01:13:45.280 --> 01:13:48.280]   If I'm not compelled by the love of Christ,
[01:13:48.280 --> 01:13:52.280]   you can't pay me enough.
[01:13:52.280 --> 01:13:56.280]   And I realize that this is not a call because I'm a pastor.
[01:13:56.280 --> 01:14:00.280]   This is a call to every single child of God.
[01:14:00.280 --> 01:14:03.280]   I'm not excused if I get off this pulpit
[01:14:03.280 --> 01:14:05.280]   that I don't need to practice this anymore.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:09.280]   This was not a unique calling for the pastorate to love.
[01:14:09.280 --> 01:14:13.280]   It's every child of God.
[01:14:13.280 --> 01:14:17.280]   And I can tell you, when I got saved in 1983,
[01:14:17.280 --> 01:14:21.280]   December 26, 11 p.m., right?
[01:14:21.280 --> 01:14:25.280]   That's how distinct my salvation was.
[01:14:25.280 --> 01:14:29.280]   I would like to tell you that God showed mercy to me
[01:14:29.280 --> 01:14:32.280]   and grace up to that point because all the things
[01:14:32.280 --> 01:14:35.280]   that I did in ignorance because I didn't know Him,
[01:14:35.280 --> 01:14:37.280]   but God showed grace and mercy to me.
[01:14:37.280 --> 01:14:41.280]   And so since then, I've been preaching the gospel,
[01:14:41.280 --> 01:14:46.280]   bringing people to Christ, and thank God that I got saved
[01:14:46.280 --> 01:14:48.280]   so that I can save all these people
[01:14:48.280 --> 01:14:50.280]   and bring people to Christ.
[01:14:50.280 --> 01:14:53.280]   I wish I could tell you that that's how my life went.
[01:14:53.280 --> 01:14:59.280]   My greatest regrets and embarrassment in life
[01:14:59.280 --> 01:15:03.280]   wasn't before 1983.
[01:15:03.280 --> 01:15:07.280]   It's since 1983.
[01:15:07.280 --> 01:15:10.280]   Considering I know what I know,
[01:15:10.280 --> 01:15:15.280]   considering that He's called me to the pastorate,
[01:15:15.280 --> 01:15:19.280]   memories of my failures,
[01:15:19.280 --> 01:15:26.280]   and to know that the only reason why I'm here
[01:15:26.280 --> 01:15:31.280]   is because God practiced this grace with me,
[01:15:31.280 --> 01:15:35.280]   because He was gracious with me.
[01:15:35.280 --> 01:15:41.280]   Sometimes we think of God as an it.
[01:15:41.280 --> 01:15:44.280]   He's an emotionless being who's just all-powerful
[01:15:44.280 --> 01:15:46.280]   and sovereign, and He just kind of dictates
[01:15:46.280 --> 01:15:48.280]   and does whatever He does.
[01:15:48.280 --> 01:15:51.280]   But we have emotions because He has emotions.
[01:15:51.280 --> 01:15:55.280]   The Bible tells us He grieves.
[01:15:55.280 --> 01:16:00.280]   When Jesus came, He wept.
[01:16:00.280 --> 01:16:06.280]   If you do not practice this love,
[01:16:06.280 --> 01:16:09.280]   you will understand the Word of God,
[01:16:09.280 --> 01:16:14.280]   but you will never be able to relate to the heart of God
[01:16:14.280 --> 01:16:18.280]   because you can explain logically.
[01:16:18.280 --> 01:16:21.280]   You could try to explain logically why Jesus came,
[01:16:21.280 --> 01:16:26.280]   but it makes no sense.
[01:16:26.280 --> 01:16:29.280]   Explain to somebody why He would send His only begotten Son,
[01:16:29.280 --> 01:16:33.280]   logically, because it's not logical.
[01:16:33.280 --> 01:16:34.280]   It doesn't make any sense.
[01:16:34.280 --> 01:16:39.280]   Why would a holy God put up with enemies
[01:16:39.280 --> 01:16:42.280]   to send His only begotten Son who won rebellion?
[01:16:42.280 --> 01:16:45.280]   It is not logical.
[01:16:45.280 --> 01:16:50.280]   There's no amount of apologetics that can explain what Jesus did.
[01:16:50.280 --> 01:16:53.280]   Because it's not logical.
[01:16:53.280 --> 01:16:56.280]   Because it's unnatural.
[01:16:56.280 --> 01:17:01.280]   Until we understand and embrace this love
[01:17:01.280 --> 01:17:04.280]   and attempt to practice this love in our lives
[01:17:04.280 --> 01:17:07.280]   to reflect what He's done,
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:10.280]   you will never understand the heart of God.
[01:17:10.280 --> 01:17:13.280]   You will never understand why He came.
[01:17:13.280 --> 01:17:17.280]   You will never understand how He loves you.
[01:17:17.280 --> 01:17:24.280]   And you will never understand why He sends us to get more.
[01:17:24.280 --> 01:17:28.280]   Because He loves us.
[01:17:28.280 --> 01:17:31.280]   He loves enemies.
[01:17:31.280 --> 01:17:35.280]   And you and I, at one point, were enemies of God.
[01:17:35.280 --> 01:17:42.280]   So He calls us to practice what He did for us.
[01:17:42.280 --> 01:17:45.280]   I don't know about you,
[01:17:45.280 --> 01:17:48.280]   but that's mind-blowing to me.
[01:17:48.280 --> 01:17:53.280]   Why would a holy God do this?
[01:17:53.280 --> 01:17:56.280]   Humanly speaking,
[01:17:56.280 --> 01:17:59.280]   it is so sad
[01:17:59.280 --> 01:18:03.280]   what our God has to put up with.
[01:18:03.280 --> 01:18:06.280]   It is so sad
[01:18:06.280 --> 01:18:08.280]   that even among His children,
[01:18:08.280 --> 01:18:11.280]   we don't understand Him.
[01:18:11.280 --> 01:18:16.280]   Even when we sin, we grieve over what it does to us.
[01:18:16.280 --> 01:18:21.280]   But very little do we think about what it does to Him.
[01:18:21.280 --> 01:18:24.280]   Despite that,
[01:18:24.280 --> 01:18:27.280]   despite that, He promises us
[01:18:27.280 --> 01:18:31.280]   that He who began a good work in you
[01:18:31.280 --> 01:18:34.280]   will carry it unto completion,
[01:18:34.280 --> 01:18:37.280]   unto the day of Christ.
[01:18:37.280 --> 01:18:40.280]   Doesn't this God deserve our praise?
[01:18:40.280 --> 01:18:43.280]   Doesn't this God deserve our love?
[01:18:43.280 --> 01:18:48.280]   Doesn't this God deserve our worship?
[01:18:48.280 --> 01:18:51.280]   Let's pray.
[01:18:51.280 --> 01:19:04.280]   Father,
[01:19:04.280 --> 01:19:08.280]   help us to see the depth,
[01:19:08.280 --> 01:19:13.280]   the length, the width, the height of Your love.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:16.280]   That every single person in this room
[01:19:16.280 --> 01:19:21.280]   will be overwhelmed by this grace.
[01:19:21.280 --> 01:19:24.280]   That we would live our lives
[01:19:24.280 --> 01:19:27.280]   being compelled by this love.
[01:19:27.280 --> 01:19:30.280]   That this love
[01:19:30.280 --> 01:19:34.280]   would cause us to love as You love.
[01:19:34.280 --> 01:19:37.280]   That we would obey Your words.
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:40.280]   That it would not be burdensome.
[01:19:40.280 --> 01:19:43.280]   But to walk in Your path,
[01:19:43.280 --> 01:19:46.280]   we'd be joyous.
[01:19:46.280 --> 01:19:49.280]   I pray, Father God,
[01:19:49.280 --> 01:19:51.280]   that You'd open our eyes,
[01:19:51.280 --> 01:19:52.280]   brighter and brighter,
[01:19:52.280 --> 01:19:55.280]   that we may see the glory of the Gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:19:55.280 --> 01:19:59.280]   That what we desire more than anything in this world
[01:19:59.280 --> 01:20:02.280]   is to please You.
[01:20:02.280 --> 01:20:05.280]   To thank You.
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.280]   To obey You.
[01:20:08.280 --> 01:20:11.280]   And to ultimately love You.
[01:20:11.280 --> 01:20:14.280]   For that end,
[01:20:14.280 --> 01:20:16.280]   may Your word
[01:20:16.280 --> 01:20:19.280]   bear fruit, Lord God, in our hearts.
[01:20:19.280 --> 01:20:22.280]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:20:22.280 --> 01:20:25.280]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
