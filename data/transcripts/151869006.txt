[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   Hebrews chapter 12 verse 12 and 13 Hebrews chapter 12 verse 12 and 13. We're
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.480]   gonna take a short break. Well it's been a long break but we're gonna take a
[00:00:12.480 --> 00:00:16.960]   little bit more time talking about the beginning of the year and the projection
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:21.160]   and what are some things that we want to focus our attention in as a church.
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:26.120]   Pastor Mark last week talked about you know making a commitment being resolved
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:29.560]   towards certain things and how important it is especially in the beginning of the
[00:00:29.560 --> 00:00:33.220]   year that we don't just kind of drift along and allow our circumstances to
[00:00:33.220 --> 00:00:39.000]   dictate how we spend our time in and our lives. I want to spend some time maybe
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.400]   week two weeks possibly up to three weeks focusing our attention projecting
[00:00:44.400 --> 00:00:48.760]   toward the right direction of what we think that our needs in our church and
[00:00:48.760 --> 00:00:52.880]   what we need to work on. So I'm not gonna be in this text but I'm just gonna be
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.000]   reading this text and then we'll jump into the two various passages this
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.080]   morning in Hebrews chapter 12 12 to 13.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:06.320]   Therefore lift your drooping hands and strengthen your weak knees and make
[00:01:06.320 --> 00:01:10.480]   straight paths for your feet so that what is lame may not be put out of joint
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:14.440]   but rather be healed. Let's pray.
[00:01:14.440 --> 00:01:20.360]   Heavenly Father we praise you for your goodness we thank you Lord God for your
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:26.800]   kindness we thank you Lord for safety we thank you for abundance Lord God of
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:33.520]   blessings we thank you for our health we thank you for allowing us to be in this
[00:01:33.520 --> 00:01:38.760]   country where we can freely express our worship and love toward you. Help
[00:01:38.760 --> 00:01:43.720]   us Lord God to give you worship that is pleasing and acceptable not simply
[00:01:43.720 --> 00:01:49.600]   ritualistic but our very hearts that we would think carefully Lord God of where
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:55.240]   where we are going what we are doing what we are thinking that we may
[00:01:55.240 --> 00:02:00.040]   surrender all things to you Father that we may bring the maximum glory that we
[00:02:00.040 --> 00:02:05.200]   can in this life for Christ and what he has done. So for that and we pray for
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:10.360]   your blessing in Jesus name we pray amen. You know at the beginning of every year
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:13.960]   we think about what are some areas in the church that we need to work on and
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:17.800]   then we try to focus our attention on that and so whether it's retreat or
[00:02:17.800 --> 00:02:22.080]   small groups or books that we read or seminars we try to focus our attention
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.840]   on those needs so that every year we're addressing different needs that we feel
[00:02:25.840 --> 00:02:29.280]   like we need. Now we haven't had a lot of time with the leaders to get together
[00:02:29.280 --> 00:02:34.720]   and to really think about it but you know as I was wrestling what is a
[00:02:34.720 --> 00:02:39.480]   weakness in our church that we really need to focus on and you know typically
[00:02:39.480 --> 00:02:43.560]   every year obviously there's a you know we could focus on pretty much every part
[00:02:43.560 --> 00:02:48.760]   of our of our vision statement whether it's genuine worship or you know right
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.520]   doctrine and theology community building missions and evangelism and and
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:58.800]   obviously every year we can you know we're gonna be striving after that and
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:03.000]   some years where it's kind of like not clear because there again so many needs
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:07.680]   there's not one thing that clearly stands out but to me this year when I
[00:03:07.680 --> 00:03:13.440]   was contemplating what is a what is a need in the church and I can honestly
[00:03:13.440 --> 00:03:18.000]   say that again as a pastor and as one of the leaders in this church that there is
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:23.960]   a gaping hole in our ministry and that we I believe need to address with the
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:30.400]   sense of urgency and that is the need for prayer. Typically when we talk about
[00:03:30.400 --> 00:03:34.880]   when we're in a Bible teaching church and you know right theology and right
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:38.640]   thinking and right community and evangelism and all of these things are
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:43.800]   necessary but we have a tendency in our culture where we think well that church
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:47.360]   is about missions or that church is about discipleship that church is about
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:51.440]   right theology that church is about the gospel this church is about you know
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:57.080]   about you know social justice and we almost think like that's okay you know
[00:03:57.080 --> 00:04:00.880]   because God uses all of us in different ways and so you kind of emphasize one
[00:04:00.880 --> 00:04:04.400]   thing we kind of side the other thing each local church does not have the
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:08.480]   privilege to you know come before God and say well I'm gonna be about this
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:13.800]   those churches are about theology but we're gonna be about missions. The
[00:04:13.800 --> 00:04:17.640]   scripture doesn't say pick and choose what stands out to you what what you
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.280]   like you know how God created you and do what you think is right. Every part of
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:29.520]   the scripture is relevant to every local church so we can't say because you know
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.680]   we're solid on theology we're solid on the word and we're doing missions and
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.000]   we're doing this and so therefore the other part you know the charismatic
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:42.440]   churches they tend to be more spiritual and they tend to be more prayerful we
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:48.320]   can't make that excuse. So as we look at our church what is an area that I
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:53.120]   believe is a gaping to me it's not just a weakness it's a gaping hole that I
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:57.640]   think we do need to address in the coming year and possibly further on that
[00:04:57.640 --> 00:05:02.240]   we need to be a praying church. First and foremost that we need to be a
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:05.680]   praying church it's not one of many things that we need to deal with I think
[00:05:05.680 --> 00:05:10.400]   we really need to deal with this before we are overly concerned about anything
[00:05:10.400 --> 00:05:14.280]   else in the church and so what I want to do is spend today and possibly next
[00:05:14.280 --> 00:05:19.920]   week in the week after that to kind of set the right foundation and obviously
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:23.560]   when I'm talking about this I'm not just talking about church as in like the
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:27.040]   leadership or just a gathering but church as a whole all of us together
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:31.640]   your personal lives and our collective gathering in the church how we're gonna
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:36.000]   address this issue but today what I want to talk about is why why is this so
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.560]   important why is he taking time to emphasize this and say it's a gaping
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:43.960]   hole why do we need to do that so there are seven things that I want to address
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:50.760]   this morning of why we need to be a praying church so again if you're taking
[00:05:50.760 --> 00:05:53.840]   notes you can say one two three four five six seven if not again just know
[00:05:53.840 --> 00:05:57.600]   that there's seven if I only did six it means I missed something okay so I'm
[00:05:57.600 --> 00:06:05.120]   gonna go over seven things this morning one the very nature of the church is for
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.920]   the purpose of prayer okay that's number one the very nature of the purpose of
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:16.160]   the church is for the for prayer if you remember in 2nd Chronicles 7 14 14 to 15
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:21.200]   it's a dead it basically is a dedication service that they have because Solomon
[00:06:21.200 --> 00:06:25.800]   builds this temple and they want to dedicate it to the Lord and the Lord
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   basically shows up to dedicate the temple the first temple of Israel and
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:35.280]   this is what God says to the nation of Israel in dedication of this temple if
[00:06:35.280 --> 00:06:41.640]   my people who are called by my name humble themselves and pray and seek my
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:45.280]   face and turn from their wicked ways then I will hear from heaven and will
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.360]   forgive their sin and heal their land now my eyes will be open and my ears
[00:06:49.360 --> 00:06:54.720]   attentive to the prayers that is made in this place so the way that God
[00:06:54.720 --> 00:06:59.600]   described this temple obviously their sacrifices there's a lot of social
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:03.120]   things that are going on in the temple but first and foremost God says in
[00:07:03.120 --> 00:07:07.440]   dedication of the temple that this is where my people will come humble
[00:07:07.440 --> 00:07:12.640]   themselves and pray and to seek me if you go to the New Testament when Jesus
[00:07:12.640 --> 00:07:16.520]   begins his ministry he begins his ministry at the temple and he concludes
[00:07:16.520 --> 00:07:22.040]   his ministry at the temple and in both times the Lord is furious what the
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:26.240]   temple worship has become he says it's become a den of robbers where people
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.480]   gathered together to sell goods back and forth and and I know that there was some
[00:07:30.480 --> 00:07:35.320]   cheating going on because of the weights but ultimately the temple was not being
[00:07:35.320 --> 00:07:40.760]   used for what God intended it wasn't a place of prayer so he in anger would
[00:07:40.760 --> 00:07:45.880]   chase people out and he says my house will be a house of prayer and his
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.480]   disciples would remember later on remembering that he said his son that
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:56.600]   the that the zeal of the Lord's house would consume him so it wasn't just one
[00:07:56.600 --> 00:07:59.920]   of many things that the Lord was disappointed and he said he was consumed
[00:07:59.920 --> 00:08:04.480]   with the thought of the temple not being used for what it was intended he begins
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:07.920]   with that cleansing of the temple and he ends with the cleansing of the temple
[00:08:07.920 --> 00:08:12.080]   now some of you guys are maybe sitting here and saying oh you know the temple
[00:08:12.080 --> 00:08:16.360]   is not the church you know that's Christianity 101 it's not the building
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.000]   it's not about the building it's about us right if you haven't read that you
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.200]   know you haven't been a Christian long that's a kind of like you know pushback
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:28.040]   whenever we talk about church well we come to the New Testament you're
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:32.600]   absolutely correct it is not the building it is not this these four walls
[00:08:32.600 --> 00:08:37.200]   that make a church but it's first Corinthians 316 said do you not know and
[00:08:37.200 --> 00:08:43.960]   the you there is in plural referring to the gathering of people do you the
[00:08:43.960 --> 00:08:49.520]   church not know that you the church are God's temple and that God's Spirit
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:54.720]   dwells in you so Paul's rebuke to the Corinthian churches do you not recognize
[00:08:54.720 --> 00:08:58.800]   that even though we're not at the temple that you guys when we gather together we
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:03.520]   are the temple and so the rebuke that he was giving to the to the Corinthian
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:07.800]   churches you're not functioning the way that the temple was intended to function
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.360]   you're competing with each other I'm of this guy I'm a bad guy but you are the
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:18.280]   temple that same sacred attitude that you had toward the physical temple you
[00:09:18.280 --> 00:09:23.760]   ought to have toward the spiritual temple the gathering of the believers so
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:29.160]   the very nature of what the church is was meant first and foremost a house of
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:34.680]   prayer now we're gonna be keep talking about this six other things but why this
[00:09:34.680 --> 00:09:39.120]   is so important if this is the nature of the church this is why gather God God
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:44.560]   gathers us together right first first and foremost it is not so that we can
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:47.200]   get together I want to have some like-minded people to raise our kids
[00:09:47.200 --> 00:09:51.840]   with you know it's about discipleship and and all of these things are
[00:09:51.840 --> 00:09:55.920]   necessary all of these things are commands of Scripture but first and
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:05.000]   foremost it has to be a place where me we meet God it is a place of prayer not
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:10.360]   only that if you look the second reason why prayer is so important in the
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.600]   Sermon on the Mount Jesus describes his people as people of
[00:10:14.600 --> 00:10:20.160]   prayer right so number one the gathering of people the church is a house of
[00:10:20.160 --> 00:10:26.360]   prayer in the Sermon on the Mount Jesus describes the people of God as people of
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.280]   prayer so if you remember the chapter 5 through chapter 7 or 8 is a sermon of
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:36.320]   the mount and the sermon of the mount is basically Jesus giving teachings about
[00:10:36.320 --> 00:10:41.160]   what the kingdom of God is like he begins by how you enter the kingdom and
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:45.760]   what what is like to be in the kingdom and then if within the teaching basically
[00:10:45.760 --> 00:10:50.240]   he's describing what the people of God what his people basically Christians
[00:10:50.240 --> 00:10:55.360]   ought to be characterized by and you know what's interesting in the way that
[00:10:55.360 --> 00:10:59.280]   he describes prayer he doesn't say if you're a Christian if you're a follower
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:05.440]   of the Son you ought to pray he doesn't even say that he assumes it he assumes
[00:11:05.440 --> 00:11:12.160]   he says when you pray pray this way see the Pharisees were not guilty of not
[00:11:12.160 --> 00:11:17.920]   praying you know the Pharisees were praying the scribes prayed regularly but
[00:11:17.920 --> 00:11:22.200]   they were praying for other people to see they were praying hypocritically so
[00:11:22.200 --> 00:11:28.240]   Matthew 6 15 Jesus says do not pray like the hypocrites but he assumes that you're
[00:11:28.240 --> 00:11:34.480]   going to pray Matthew 6 9 you know Jesus performed all these miracles he walked
[00:11:34.480 --> 00:11:40.680]   on water he fed miraculously 510 possibly up to 20,000 people miraculously
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:46.080]   right they were they had front row seats when a lame person got up and he started
[00:11:46.080 --> 00:11:53.640]   walking right they saw blind people open their eyes they had the front seat they
[00:11:53.640 --> 00:11:59.000]   saw all of this but when it was coming time for discipleship and and wanted to
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:04.320]   ask Jesus would you teach us how to do this above all the things that they
[00:12:04.320 --> 00:12:09.840]   observed they come to Jesus say Lord teach us how to pray because they must
[00:12:09.840 --> 00:12:14.120]   have recognized and Jesus's humanity that there was something different about
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:17.320]   Jesus now they knew that he was the Messiah and that's why they stuck with
[00:12:17.320 --> 00:12:21.480]   him whether they fully understood him or not and they recognize his miracles they
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.680]   recognize all of these things but in his humanity they recognize that there was
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:31.280]   something about his discipline of prayer and so above everything that they could
[00:12:31.280 --> 00:12:38.080]   have possibly asked they asked Jesus teach me how to pray and it is in that
[00:12:38.080 --> 00:12:45.400]   context where we get the Lord's Prayer that's Matthew chapter 6 16 says in the
[00:12:45.400 --> 00:12:50.080]   way that we fast Matthew 7 7 through 11 that we ought to persevere in the way
[00:12:50.080 --> 00:12:57.080]   that we pray ask seek and knock and then in Matthew chapter 9 36 at the conclusion
[00:12:57.080 --> 00:13:01.320]   of the Sermon of the Mount he prepares his disciples to begin to go he wants to
[00:13:01.320 --> 00:13:05.640]   send them out and at the beginning of his calling to send them out so that
[00:13:05.640 --> 00:13:09.080]   they can begin to practice the things that they've learned the first thing
[00:13:09.080 --> 00:13:13.000]   that he runs into is that Jesus sees a multitude and he has compassion for them
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   and when he has compassion for them he turns around to his disciples he says
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:22.360]   these people are like sheep without a shepherd harassed and so he turns to
[00:13:22.360 --> 00:13:26.040]   them he doesn't he says therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest the
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:31.240]   harvest is plentiful and the workers are few therefore pray right and that word
[00:13:31.240 --> 00:13:36.200]   for beseech is not just a casual praying it means to me it means to be committed
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.160]   to this to beseech and hang on cry out to God to send out more workers so not
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:46.880]   only is the gathering of the church the very nature of it is for the purpose of
[00:13:46.880 --> 00:13:53.680]   prayer or the character to me one of the main characters of a Christian is a man
[00:13:53.680 --> 00:14:02.200]   who prays thirdly the early church they understood this now they had a hard time
[00:14:02.200 --> 00:14:06.200]   understanding this before Jesus was resurrected but the early church
[00:14:06.200 --> 00:14:11.080]   prioritize prayer the early church was characterized by prayer now we often
[00:14:11.080 --> 00:14:15.040]   talk about how you know we need to be like the book of Acts and and you have a
[00:14:15.040 --> 00:14:18.640]   lot of churches that are saying we're the axe church or acts 29 because they
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:22.360]   want to be like the axe church a lot of times when we talk about that we're
[00:14:22.360 --> 00:14:26.200]   talking about their fellowship we're talking about evangelism we're talking
[00:14:26.200 --> 00:14:30.240]   about you know they're just being devoted but one of the main things that
[00:14:30.240 --> 00:14:36.480]   characterize the early church was their devotion to prayer now we look at the
[00:14:36.480 --> 00:14:41.320]   early church and say well why were they able to experience so much success in
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.800]   fact you know if you remember the early church went from a hundred twenty people
[00:14:45.800 --> 00:14:50.480]   who was praying at Mark's house hundred twenty and then they added three
[00:14:50.480 --> 00:14:55.240]   thousand three thousand was just a number of men right anytime you see the
[00:14:55.240 --> 00:14:58.000]   numbers in the Bible you know that that's only talking about men so
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.520]   immediately it doubles okay well not they're not all married but including
[00:15:02.520 --> 00:15:05.560]   the children immediately an accurate number will be somewhere around six
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:09.760]   thousand to maybe even ten and if they had you know knowing knowing back at
[00:15:09.760 --> 00:15:13.560]   that time if you include the children it could easily be ten fifteen thousand
[00:15:13.560 --> 00:15:16.720]   people right so let's just be conservative and I just say ten
[00:15:16.720 --> 00:15:21.400]   thousand people got added in the early church can you imagine you know we have
[00:15:21.400 --> 00:15:24.760]   somewhere around four to five hundred people in our church can you imagine one
[00:15:24.760 --> 00:15:29.080]   Sunday one Sunday you show up and there's ten thousand people here right
[00:15:29.080 --> 00:15:35.340]   the kind of logistical chaos right that the lunch team prepare for 200 and we
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:40.000]   have ten thousand people right I mean you can imagine the kind of problems
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.920]   that they would have had well what caused them to be a church that was so
[00:15:46.920 --> 00:15:51.720]   used powerfully before God we see over and over again it said they got together
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:56.920]   in Acts 241 after 3,000 people convert they devoted themselves to the apostles
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:03.000]   teaching fellowship breaking bread and to prayer it was a community committed
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:09.480]   to the Word of God and to prayer in Acts chapter 3 1 we see Paul we see Peter and
[00:16:09.480 --> 00:16:13.960]   John he says in it was time for them to pray it was a time of the day for them
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:17.280]   to pray in other words they had specific times when they went to the temple on a
[00:16:17.280 --> 00:16:23.040]   regular basis to pray when they run into this man who was lame and he heals them
[00:16:23.040 --> 00:16:28.880]   it was in the context of prayer in Acts chapter 431 when the leaders of Israel
[00:16:28.880 --> 00:16:33.480]   tells tells the leaders to Peter and John said if you continue to preach
[00:16:33.480 --> 00:16:36.840]   you're gonna get in trouble and said well you tell me if it's right for us to
[00:16:36.840 --> 00:16:42.320]   obey you or obey God and they go out and they praise God and they go home what
[00:16:42.320 --> 00:16:47.840]   do they do they have a primity and they pray diligently in Acts chapter 6 for
[00:16:47.840 --> 00:16:53.320]   you guys know that passage right the Grecian widows were being neglected so
[00:16:53.320 --> 00:16:58.160]   again we'll talk about 120 people went to about 10,000 people and one of the
[00:16:58.160 --> 00:17:02.560]   first problems that they ran into and we could easily understand that that the
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:07.760]   Grecian widows the minority widows that was part of the early church they were
[00:17:07.760 --> 00:17:12.360]   being neglected in the distribution of food so a lot of them you know if you're
[00:17:12.360 --> 00:17:15.680]   a widow at that time you had no other way to eat so they basically came and
[00:17:15.680 --> 00:17:19.800]   the church collected funds and and they distributed the food to one another and
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:23.400]   the Grecian widows were being neglected because they they weren't part of the
[00:17:23.400 --> 00:17:28.160]   majority group now you have to understand when we're talking about the
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:33.480]   problem in Acts chapter 6 we're not talking about boba right we're not
[00:17:33.480 --> 00:17:37.800]   talking about dessert you know they all ate is they they're always getting the
[00:17:37.800 --> 00:17:42.640]   bigger piece of the cake that's not the problem they weren't eating the food
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:46.360]   wasn't being distributed another they weren't eating so you talk about an
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:50.840]   emergency there's a there's a group of people in the church who aren't eating
[00:17:50.840 --> 00:17:54.920]   right say man I mean you talk about an emergency we're not talking about a
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:17:58.560]   leaking toilet we're not talking about you know water coming down the ceiling
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:06.520]   we're talking about a old widows who weren't being fed so if there was any
[00:18:06.520 --> 00:18:11.200]   excuse to say you know let's stop everything stop everything and we need
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:15.520]   to pay attention to this because until they eat we can't continue to do
[00:18:15.520 --> 00:18:20.320]   ministry but remember what the Apostle said it is wrong for us to neglect the
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:27.440]   preaching of the Word of God and praying to deal with this now think about that
[00:18:27.440 --> 00:18:31.680]   we always say oh there's you know they're so wise imagine if you were in
[00:18:31.680 --> 00:18:35.800]   there it's like they're not eating and you're gonna preach we're gonna have a
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:42.040]   prayer meeting when they're not eating see the early church when the Apostles
[00:18:42.040 --> 00:18:47.800]   if you really understand in the context they're saying the teaching of the Word
[00:18:47.800 --> 00:18:53.400]   of God and praying is even more important than eating how often do we
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:57.320]   say you know what I wake up too early in the morning I have so many kids in my in
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:19:02.720]   my house and you don't know my schedule and they only if I had more time but
[00:19:02.720 --> 00:19:06.760]   again in the church it said this was so important and we're gonna see why this
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:10.560]   is so important why they had to prioritize this above everything else
[00:19:10.560 --> 00:19:15.080]   Acts chapter 13 1 & 2 the first missionary journey happened in the
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:19.480]   context of praying and fasting the Holy Spirit says to set up a set apart Paul
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.760]   and Barnabas and so as a result of that they lay hands and they begin this
[00:19:23.760 --> 00:19:27.920]   missionary journey and they go and preach the gospel and plant churches so
[00:19:27.920 --> 00:19:33.440]   not only is the church the identity of the church a house of prayer the people
[00:19:33.440 --> 00:19:38.000]   of God are people of prayer and the early church in the very beginning the
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:43.240]   reason why it was so flourishing and fruitful is not because they were more
[00:19:43.240 --> 00:19:47.640]   smarter than the average pastor it wasn't because they were more powerful
[00:19:47.640 --> 00:19:52.760]   in some way I mean yes they were the primary reason was because they were
[00:19:52.760 --> 00:20:02.920]   people of prayer they prayed you know I know like especially the Bible teaching
[00:20:02.920 --> 00:20:07.120]   church is kind of sounds better if I told you like you know I wasn't a
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.320]   Christian and then at one year you know 1983 I was reading the scripture and you
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:16.640]   know Romans 528 and God demonstrates his own love towards and that while we were
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:20.400]   yet since Christ died for us and that gripped my heart and changed my mind and
[00:20:20.400 --> 00:20:25.120]   I had this revival and Reformation came right it sounds better it sounds more
[00:20:25.120 --> 00:20:30.160]   consistent with a Bible teaching church that the Bible convicted me what
[00:20:30.160 --> 00:20:35.920]   convicted me was I saw a group of guys my age praying right because I grew up
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:40.680]   all my life here in the gospel I memorized the gospel I had the Lord's
[00:20:40.680 --> 00:20:45.280]   prayer memorized in Korean and English I my dad made me memorize the Apostles
[00:20:45.280 --> 00:20:49.480]   Creed in Korean I didn't understand a word I was memorizing but I did it
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:20:53.160]   because he's gonna give me a quarter right a quarter was a lot more money
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:58.240]   back then it was like worth like a dollar right so I grew up in a church we
[00:20:58.240 --> 00:21:02.360]   had family devotions I I don't ever remember not coming to church I don't
[00:21:02.360 --> 00:21:06.320]   ever remember missing church for any reason whether I was sick or they were I
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:13.040]   just don't remember right I grew up saturated with the gospel what changed
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:16.720]   me was I if you asked me at that time are you a Christian I would have said
[00:21:16.720 --> 00:21:21.440]   yes because I went to church if you told me what makes you a Christian Jesus
[00:21:21.440 --> 00:21:25.840]   died for me you do believe in God I would have told you yes I would have I
[00:21:25.840 --> 00:21:29.960]   wouldn't have told you I don't believe I believe all of that but it was just
[00:21:29.960 --> 00:21:35.880]   words that I said I went up to a retreat what what sparked my interest was I saw
[00:21:35.880 --> 00:21:40.440]   a bunch of guys my age and it was a charismatic group so they prayed you
[00:21:40.440 --> 00:21:44.440]   know they prayed fervently but it made me think like man these guys are praying
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:50.440]   like God's actually listening you know they're actually listening so it just
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:55.120]   got me curious it's like I've always prayed kind of like many of you may
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:59.680]   always pray I always pray before meals you know when you have a gathering of
[00:21:59.680 --> 00:22:04.080]   Christians you're supposed to start with prayer so you pray yeah you almost feel
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.400]   like if you don't pray before you eat you're gonna get stomachache or
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:13.600]   something so you know what I mean so you that's kind of part of your ritual right
[00:22:13.600 --> 00:22:19.520]   but it was prayer it was these men and women of prayer that caused me to think
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:25.680]   like if God is actually there and if God is actually answering prayers if these
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:31.080]   people actually have a relationship with God that makes sense to me why wouldn't
[00:22:31.080 --> 00:22:35.360]   you pray to this God and that's what caused me to get on my knees that God if
[00:22:35.360 --> 00:22:39.800]   if they know something that I don't know I want to know you that was my
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:44.960]   repentance I didn't know any better that's all I said like if they know
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:50.080]   something that I don't know I want to know right and that's what caused me to
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.800]   open my eyes that was my invitation for God to come into my life and I began to
[00:22:53.800 --> 00:22:57.000]   see all this sin and and it wasn't because somebody convicted me saying
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.560]   this is wrong this is wrong I already knew I was a sinner and just being in
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:10.520]   the presence of God caused me to realize how dirty I was see this is why prayer
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:15.200]   is so important in the church we ought to be characterized by people who pray
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:22.120]   fourthly we are commanded to pray in Colossians 4 - it says devote yourself to
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:26.720]   prayer devote yourself it is not a casual I'll pray when I can this is not
[00:23:26.720 --> 00:23:31.000]   a casual if I have enough time in the morning he says no be committed to
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:35.640]   prayer if you can't commit you if you know that you cannot pay your bills next
[00:23:35.640 --> 00:23:40.080]   year next week you're going to be committed to finding a way for getting a
[00:23:40.080 --> 00:23:43.920]   job whatever you need to do if you have marriage problems and there's tension
[00:23:43.920 --> 00:23:47.280]   you're going to be committed to somehow fixing that kid counseling talk to other
[00:23:47.280 --> 00:23:53.120]   people he says when it comes to prayer he says to be devoted to prayer first
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:59.920]   lesson on 517 he says pray without ceasing constantly you know sometimes
[00:23:59.920 --> 00:24:04.560]   the way that we pray that we only pray when there are emergencies when
[00:24:04.560 --> 00:24:07.760]   something happens in our life we lose our job or we're sick or something
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:11.160]   something happens where we feel completely helpless then we come before
[00:24:11.160 --> 00:24:16.760]   God and we pray right but the problem with that is even the non-christians
[00:24:16.760 --> 00:24:22.760]   pray when they're desperate when they're desperate you ever hear see now it's on
[00:24:22.760 --> 00:24:26.720]   the Facebook when tragedy happens you see all these people these gangster
[00:24:26.720 --> 00:24:29.880]   rappers and then you know they're crossing it up and you know talking about
[00:24:29.880 --> 00:24:34.240]   all kinds of debauchery and all of a sudden somebody gets shot and then you
[00:24:34.240 --> 00:24:40.680]   hear on their tweet my prayers are with you right after 9/11 the whole world was
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:45.520]   praying we're praying for America we're praying for these people people have
[00:24:45.520 --> 00:24:48.600]   never prayed in their life all of a sudden gathering hands and Republican
[00:24:48.600 --> 00:24:53.080]   Democrats in Capitol Hill had a prayer meeting there was no atheists
[00:24:53.080 --> 00:24:58.680]   complaining about the prayer meeting at that time if our prayers are only
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:25:04.080]   motivated when when the whole world is motivated how is our prayer and
[00:25:04.080 --> 00:25:09.760]   relationship any different see the world prays when they see physical emergency
[00:25:09.760 --> 00:25:13.120]   when they feel desperate desperate see the difference between our prayers and
[00:25:13.120 --> 00:25:18.440]   the prayers of the world is that we recognize by faith what the world does
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:23.240]   not recognize that there is an urgency in our lives even if our bills are paid
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:28.320]   even when our children are completely healthy and everything is good we know
[00:25:28.320 --> 00:25:36.400]   that there is an urgent need for us to pray see in James chapter 513 is any of
[00:25:36.400 --> 00:25:43.960]   you in trouble he should pray how often do we get into trouble and and seek
[00:25:43.960 --> 00:25:47.360]   counseling you know we think oh we need to organize our life this way maybe we
[00:25:47.360 --> 00:25:51.200]   should stop spending money in that way and maybe if we did this and that but he
[00:25:51.200 --> 00:25:56.480]   said first and foremost anyone is in trouble first and foremost he says to
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:01.800]   pray in fact in first Peter 312 is it for the eyes of the Lord are on the
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:07.480]   righteous and his ears are attentive to their prayers or God is listening any
[00:26:07.480 --> 00:26:15.360]   desires to listen how often we think of God as just a being or thing or force
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:21.120]   but not really think of a God who who sent his only begotten Son to reconcile
[00:26:21.120 --> 00:26:26.520]   us that we may become his adopted children now we call him our Abba father
[00:26:26.520 --> 00:26:34.280]   but do we have the affection that we have for our fathers to our God the way
[00:26:34.280 --> 00:26:39.760]   that the Bible describes his affection for us imagine if you made an
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.920]   appointment with somebody you know at four o'clock and they don't show up you
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:49.040]   know and you guys are gracious and loving and patient people and you're
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.800]   Christians and if you're not patient you're gonna get judged so you're gonna
[00:26:52.800 --> 00:26:57.360]   try to be patient you make another appointment you blew it today I'm gonna
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:27:01.680]   be merciful I'm gonna be Jesus and I'm gonna be merciful and we'll make another
[00:27:01.680 --> 00:27:04.680]   appointment tomorrow at four o'clock four o'clock comes on and they blow you
[00:27:04.680 --> 00:27:11.760]   off and they don't come right again this guy just has no respect he's so
[00:27:11.760 --> 00:27:16.320]   inconsiderate but you're Jesus you know what I mean like seven times right so
[00:27:16.320 --> 00:27:19.360]   you know forgive him you're gonna forgive him we're gonna be patient
[00:27:19.360 --> 00:27:25.080]   because this is what Jesus does right do it third time it's like I twice maybe
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:30.600]   three times that's among me right he needs me to be righteous
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:37.240]   fourth time forget it I'm never meeting with this guy a fifth time move don't
[00:27:37.240 --> 00:27:41.800]   have anything to do with this guy right even in human relationship I mean we
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:45.280]   would think at some point at some point you would think if you keep blowing off
[00:27:45.280 --> 00:27:49.920]   and you you're not interested in having a relationship with this person isn't
[00:27:49.920 --> 00:27:53.560]   that what you would think and if you don't think that somebody in your life
[00:27:53.560 --> 00:27:57.760]   is gonna tell you that that don't go out how can you last five time you told him
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:01.520]   you're gonna meet him he blew you off he's not interested in a relationship
[00:28:01.520 --> 00:28:08.480]   with you if God continues to plead with his church and his church continues to
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:12.440]   say I'm busy at what point do you think God was saying maybe he's just not
[00:28:12.440 --> 00:28:18.520]   interested in me at some point you would think that that would be the common sense
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:25.320]   thing to think right we are told to pray we are told to be devoted to prayer why
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:30.480]   do we need to be devoted to prayer fifth because we are engaged in a spiritual
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:36.960]   warfare we are engaged in a spiritual warfare in Ephesians 6 12 it says we do
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:40.320]   not wrestle against flesh and blood but against the rulers against the
[00:28:40.320 --> 00:28:44.880]   authorities against the cosmic powers over this present darkness against the
[00:28:44.880 --> 00:28:51.160]   spiritual forces of evil in heavenly places so that passage kind of reminds
[00:28:51.160 --> 00:28:54.360]   the Church of Ephesus that this is why you need to be devoted to these things
[00:28:54.360 --> 00:29:00.960]   because you can't fix you can't win by being smart by having willpower by being
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:06.320]   determined I mean if you're selling coca-cola maybe go to school get the
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:10.160]   education and you apply the right techniques which again in our modern
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:14.520]   church day church growth movement you kind of think like if you just went to
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:17.400]   the right school and read the right books and talk to the right people and
[00:29:17.400 --> 00:29:20.960]   had enough experience or maybe you're just one of those high-caliber people
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:25.200]   that would have been a CEO in a company now you're just applying your intellect
[00:29:25.200 --> 00:29:29.320]   and your your gifts to the church and now you're gonna be successful that's
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:33.760]   not what the scripture says is spiritual warfare how are you going to overcome
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:40.680]   the power of Satan by your technique so that's why he says our struggle is not
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:45.720]   against flesh and blood it's not something you can fix by by applying the
[00:29:45.720 --> 00:29:51.160]   right technique that's why he says to put on the all these different armors of
[00:29:51.160 --> 00:29:56.440]   God and then he and then he tells us and summarizes Ephesians 618 and pray in the
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:30:01.280]   Spirit on all occasions with all kinds of prayers and requests with this in
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:05.900]   mind be alert and always keep on praying for all the saints you notice how often
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:10.560]   he says all you know sometimes the way that we pray in the church especially in
[00:30:10.560 --> 00:30:14.800]   a Bible teaching church is more of a sprinkling than a dunking you know we're
[00:30:14.800 --> 00:30:18.360]   a Baptist Church so we believe in dunking that's sprinkling right so the
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:24.880]   way that we pray is we sprinkle prayer before we have a meeting we pray you
[00:30:24.880 --> 00:30:28.600]   know before we play football we pray before we go watch movies or whatever
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.640]   we're doing we pray so we sprinkle prayer in the beginning we sprinkle
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:38.120]   prayer at the end he's saying at all times in all occasions for all people
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:44.480]   for all the Saints he's saying to be saturated in prayer to be protected
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:49.940]   because we're in spiritual warfare the sprinkling is not gonna do he says to
[00:30:49.940 --> 00:30:55.480]   saturate your life saturate the church in prayer first Peter 4 7 the end of all
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:31:00.880]   things is near therefore be clear-minded and self-control so that you can pray do
[00:31:00.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   you notice the priority in first Peter 4 7 you know the priority in force Peter
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:09.840]   he says in all things is near therefore be clear-minded and self-controlled so
[00:31:09.840 --> 00:31:13.200]   that you can pray typically we say you know we need to pray so that we can be
[00:31:13.200 --> 00:31:18.320]   clear-minded so that we can we can be clear-minded to do the work of God here
[00:31:18.320 --> 00:31:25.520]   he says the work of God is prayer which makes sense doesn't it is the power
[00:31:25.520 --> 00:31:32.560]   behind our work was the power behind behind God would you rather you know go
[00:31:32.560 --> 00:31:38.080]   into battle knowing that God is going ahead of you or you say you know what
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:42.280]   get behind me just push me just tell me where to go and sometimes the way that
[00:31:42.280 --> 00:31:46.360]   we minister the way that we behave we almost kind of like I'm gonna do it but
[00:31:46.360 --> 00:31:51.160]   make sure God has my back right and that's kind of like the way we pray
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:56.920]   that's kind of we approach spiritual warfare he says pray and let him go and
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:04.240]   you follow him saturated in prayer remember Matthew 26 41 you know we talk
[00:32:04.240 --> 00:32:09.600]   about we talk about you know like Jesus is last teaching and we know that he he
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:13.280]   washed the disciples feet so we need to be humble and wash our feet and all of
[00:32:13.280 --> 00:32:17.680]   that is true that was a formal education that was given to the disciples but the
[00:32:17.680 --> 00:32:22.840]   very last commandment very last thing that he demonstrated and showed to his
[00:32:22.840 --> 00:32:27.840]   disciples before he left was in Matthew 26 41 where he was praying at the Garden
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:32.560]   of Gethsemane and the disciples after an hour he would come back and they would
[00:32:32.560 --> 00:32:36.400]   fall asleep and humanly speaking I completely understand that they just had
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:41.280]   a huge meal they had a Passover meal then they have lamb you know filled with
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:45.000]   their stomach and and then you know like if you're filled with food that's not
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.920]   the best way to prepare for for prayer meeting right you need to be hungry you
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.200]   be fasting but these guys just gorged on food and just and they're like oh what
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:58.640]   are we doing it we're gonna go pray and I can imagine disciples like what stop a
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.480]   clock at night we just had you know buffet you know this was not ordinary
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.680]   meal this is a Passover meal he was like it was like a feast right they just had
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:10.120]   a feast and they're going on Jesus going and praying because he knows what's
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.680]   coming he comes back and the disciples are falling asleep right it's in that
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:20.400]   context Jesus says watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation the
[00:33:20.400 --> 00:33:27.280]   spirit indeed is willing but the flesh is weak watch and pray so that you would
[00:33:27.280 --> 00:33:33.920]   not enter into temptation Jesus was a human being was he superhuman being that
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:38.240]   that he didn't he wasn't ever tired which is that not the case remember
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:42.520]   Jesus was so tired on the boat everybody else was freaking out because a storm
[00:33:42.520 --> 00:33:47.160]   but Jesus was sleep you know say oh why was Jesus asleep isn't he omnipotent
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:50.640]   isn't he I'm the I'm the president isn't he omniscient and why is he sleeping
[00:33:50.640 --> 00:33:56.880]   it's simple answer he was tired he was tired he was a human being he was 100%
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:34:04.240]   human being and he was that tired but here you don't see the fatigue because
[00:34:04.240 --> 00:34:07.760]   he knows what's coming the only difference between him and the disciples
[00:34:07.760 --> 00:34:13.640]   that disciples don't see what's coming so all they know is they're tired and
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:18.680]   that's why Jesus says you may be willing right your spirit is willing but your
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:22.440]   flesh is weak you know how many times we say oh you know our flesh is weak and
[00:34:22.440 --> 00:34:26.440]   people are so weak prayer so hard and you know we all struggle with that
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:30.520]   because our flesh is weak look what Jesus says he says exactly the opposite
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.960]   because your flesh is weak you need to pray he doesn't say because your flesh
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:40.720]   is weak God understands he says no because your flesh is weak you need to
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:47.320]   pray there's a spiritual warfare going on the Bible says there there's a our
[00:34:47.320 --> 00:34:52.160]   enemies like a roaring lion seeking someone to devour I'm not saying that to
[00:34:52.160 --> 00:34:59.800]   scare you the Bible says that how many of you know that there is an active
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:06.680]   spiritual force that wants to devour you how many what was the last time you
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:10.600]   thought about that when was the last time you felt safe because you had a gun
[00:35:10.600 --> 00:35:17.400]   in your house completely not knowing not even thinking about that they're
[00:35:17.400 --> 00:35:24.560]   spiritual what Satan can do is much more dangerous than what a gun could do right
[00:35:24.560 --> 00:35:30.360]   I'm not trying to get political and take any sides here but how secure do we feel
[00:35:30.360 --> 00:35:34.040]   because we locked our doors and we bought our house in a nice neighborhood
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:37.440]   and we don't have strange people walking around our neighborhood when the
[00:35:37.440 --> 00:35:41.840]   scripture says that we have an enemy like a roaring lion seeking to devour
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:49.080]   you and me anybody who has anything to do with Christ he wants to devour so I
[00:35:49.080 --> 00:35:54.160]   know you're willing I know your desire but your flesh is weak so therefore he
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:36:01.000]   says to pray there's a spiritual battle going on six prayer is the most tangible
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:08.280]   way to humble ourselves now we talked about many times how the primary sin of
[00:36:08.280 --> 00:36:13.760]   mankind is arrogance and pride those of you who've been studying through Isaiah
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:17.840]   with us where Isaiah chapter 14 a description of Lucifer and his primary
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:24.680]   description his arrogance he wants to get to God's level maybe beyond that and
[00:36:24.680 --> 00:36:30.280]   all his disciples he wants the whole world to get behind him to do that sin
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:35.280]   of mankind Adam and Eve was it their arrogance they wanted to be lifted Tower
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:43.640]   of Babel at the core of mankind sin is pride you know we can be successful in
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:49.280]   the church and it leads to pride we can go to school get a PhD in theology and
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:56.080]   about humility and that PhD in humility causes you to be proud right I mean it's
[00:36:56.080 --> 00:37:00.680]   an oxymoron it's true you know we're servants of Christ but we're servants of
[00:37:00.680 --> 00:37:05.560]   Christ you know I mean that's that it doesn't take a lot for us to become
[00:37:05.560 --> 00:37:10.680]   proud you play a basketball game and you win by one point and you'll brag about
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:15.040]   that for the rest of your life remember that time I schooled you I owned you by
[00:37:15.040 --> 00:37:21.280]   that one point you barely won right you come into a room right and you're a
[00:37:21.280 --> 00:37:27.120]   little bit taller than anybody and it's like my shirt here you know maybe your
[00:37:27.120 --> 00:37:30.720]   hair is a little bit thicker maybe you get it you earn a little bit more money
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:34.160]   maybe you're a little bit more thinner maybe you're a little bit more athlete
[00:37:34.160 --> 00:37:39.360]   it doesn't take a lot you went to UCLA or over UC Irvine or you went to whatever
[00:37:39.360 --> 00:37:46.520]   it doesn't take a lot all of this is just a little bit of being a little bit
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:50.440]   better than somebody else and it fills us with pride you read the Word of God
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:53.040]   it caused you to be proud you're a little bit disciplined it caused you to
[00:37:53.040 --> 00:37:59.200]   be proud it doesn't take much you can be successful in a church you can make
[00:37:59.200 --> 00:38:03.720]   disciples convert people and at the end of it said look at me and you ruin
[00:38:03.720 --> 00:38:10.440]   everything the most tangible way for us to humble ourselves is to depend upon
[00:38:10.440 --> 00:38:17.880]   God remember Paul he says in Corinthians that there's a thorn on his side right
[00:38:17.880 --> 00:38:21.320]   and he pleaded with the Lord and and no matter how many times I skip through
[00:38:21.320 --> 00:38:23.600]   that and people say we don't know what it is we don't know what it is I think
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:27.920]   it's pretty obvious the thorn on his side are all the people who are who are
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:31.880]   questioning his apostleship they're causing trouble and the very reason why
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.280]   he's writing first and second Corinthians I think that's a thorn on
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:40.080]   his side because when he went to Jesus he said because all this revelation I'm
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:44.560]   trying to keep you humble on purpose so what was humbling Paul all these people
[00:38:44.560 --> 00:38:50.240]   who are questioning him and Jesus says in order to keep you humble I'm allowing
[00:38:50.240 --> 00:38:57.880]   this in your life right just to keep you humble I'll bet you anything I'll bet
[00:38:57.880 --> 00:39:02.600]   you anything that there's somebody in your life that's a thorn on your side
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:08.400]   you know it's some maybe not so bad that you're clean to God but I'll bet you
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:13.440]   anything just from years of counseling people that everybody in this room if
[00:39:13.440 --> 00:39:18.560]   not majority of you have somebody in your life who just doesn't get you or at
[00:39:18.560 --> 00:39:22.080]   least that's how you that's what you think say I that guy you know everybody
[00:39:22.080 --> 00:39:25.560]   thinks he's a good guy but that guy you know you don't know him behind the scene
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:30.320]   he they think he's so generous but no that guy I've seen him with these people
[00:39:30.320 --> 00:39:34.360]   there's all there's always somebody in your life that he everybody else you
[00:39:34.360 --> 00:39:37.320]   have you have no problems but that there's that one guy in your life it may
[00:39:37.320 --> 00:39:44.640]   be a family member and maybe your husband or your wife it may it may be
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:48.800]   say just a just an acquaintance maybe somebody in this room or maybe somebody
[00:39:48.800 --> 00:39:53.320]   outside this room and maybe that's why you came here right and then somebody
[00:39:53.320 --> 00:39:59.520]   else happens here right I think there are times when God deliberately in fact
[00:39:59.520 --> 00:40:04.800]   not times they're always right there's God places certain people and certain
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:09.840]   things in your life for that very purpose of keeping you humble and you
[00:40:09.840 --> 00:40:15.600]   can't stand it right you can't stand it when somebody questions your integrity
[00:40:15.600 --> 00:40:21.800]   questions who you are right well Jesus says to Paul I I'm allowing it on
[00:40:21.800 --> 00:40:27.720]   purpose I'm allowing it on purpose to keep you humble because if you don't
[00:40:27.720 --> 00:40:35.520]   stay humble you will be ruined you'll be ruined that pride that enters in that
[00:40:35.520 --> 00:40:39.720]   somehow you think you can do it that you're somebody outside of God will
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:45.120]   ruin you not recognizing the scripture says that God is directly opposed to the
[00:40:45.120 --> 00:40:50.880]   proud not realizing our desire to be on a pedestal to be seen and to be
[00:40:50.880 --> 00:40:58.480]   recognized is inviting God's attention to humble us that God says I will be
[00:40:58.480 --> 00:41:03.520]   against you if you get puffed up and lift yourself up and yet every single
[00:41:03.520 --> 00:41:07.920]   day we live to kind of be on that pedestal kind of subtly not directly
[00:41:07.920 --> 00:41:11.960]   you're too smart for that right people will see right through that so it has to
[00:41:11.960 --> 00:41:17.400]   be very subtle right it comes out in our speech in our conduct and in the way we
[00:41:17.400 --> 00:41:22.800]   get annoyed when people certain you know question certain things but the whole
[00:41:22.800 --> 00:41:27.200]   walk with God is about coming before his throne and humbling ourselves there's
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:31.080]   nothing more tangible that we could do as Christians but to humble ourselves in
[00:41:31.080 --> 00:41:36.400]   prayer even the Lord's Prayer if you look at the Lord's Prayer it says our
[00:41:36.400 --> 00:41:40.960]   Father who art in heaven hallowed be thy name recognizing him thy kingdom come
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:46.080]   thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven a person who is seeking his own
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:53.360]   will his own glorification cannot pray cannot pray because God says to seek his
[00:41:53.360 --> 00:41:58.080]   kingdom to seek his will so if I have my will and trying to bend his will you
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:03.040]   can't even pray the Lord's Prayer the Lord's Prayer is a prayer of surrender
[00:42:03.040 --> 00:42:08.040]   thy kingdom come thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven give us this
[00:42:08.040 --> 00:42:12.720]   day our daily bread now where does that thought daily bread come from right the
[00:42:12.720 --> 00:42:16.360]   Jews when they were in the desert and God gave them manna and told them to
[00:42:16.360 --> 00:42:21.440]   only choose daily bread and only the day before the Sabbath collecting up for two
[00:42:21.440 --> 00:42:26.320]   days but every other day only one day I mean that doesn't seem efficient right
[00:42:26.320 --> 00:42:29.920]   just go and collect for the whole month and you can have the whole rest of the
[00:42:29.920 --> 00:42:34.320]   month and do whatever you want there was a reason behind that every day that
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.880]   they are reminded that they are absolutely utterly dependent upon God
[00:42:37.880 --> 00:42:42.040]   and that's the prayer of the Lord's Prayer give us this day our daily bread
[00:42:42.040 --> 00:42:47.680]   it is a prayer of surrender and dependence forgive us as our debts as we
[00:42:47.680 --> 00:42:52.520]   forgive our debtors that we humble ourselves and give it away lead us not
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:59.280]   into temptation but deliver us from evil right that's the Lord's Prayer that I
[00:42:59.280 --> 00:43:05.240]   can't fight I can't be delivered by the enemy's influence in my life without God
[00:43:05.240 --> 00:43:11.920]   being merciful to me let me say this if you do not pray on a regular basis you
[00:43:11.920 --> 00:43:19.360]   do not know how much satanic influence is in your head right now you don't even
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.600]   know you have demonic thinking the way that you view certain people the things
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:29.920]   that you desire and longing for you don't know how much of that is satanic
[00:43:29.920 --> 00:43:33.880]   because the only way that we can be delivered from that is by his power not
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:39.120]   by our smart not by our experience you can be thinking about godly things and
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:47.760]   be satanic now let me back that up Peter we can say well you know Judas or my
[00:43:47.760 --> 00:43:52.640]   heed we can't be we can't be you know we can't be possessed because we're
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:57.720]   Christians yeah right you're right but look at Peter he had every good
[00:43:57.720 --> 00:44:02.480]   intention Jesus is going to the cross and he says no you cannot go and Jesus
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:07.760]   sees right through that there's satanic involvement in this get behind me Satan
[00:44:07.760 --> 00:44:13.440]   so when an individual is walking by himself not saturated by the Spirit of
[00:44:13.440 --> 00:44:20.680]   God even reading the Word of God can lead you astray can it not have you ever
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:24.240]   met somebody who knew the Word of God and actually absolutely pervert the Word
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:29.320]   of God have you ever met somebody who justified every sin that they commit and
[00:44:29.320 --> 00:44:35.960]   they have a verse to back it up yes I've seen people use the Word of God to back
[00:44:35.960 --> 00:44:41.600]   up abortion I've seen people use the Word of God to back up adultery yeah I
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:47.080]   mean as ridiculous as that sound when our heart is not pure even the Word of
[00:44:47.080 --> 00:44:52.240]   God can be perverted and so we even the ability to understand what it says is
[00:44:52.240 --> 00:44:59.280]   dependent upon his mercy and that's why he says lead us not into temptation he
[00:44:59.280 --> 00:45:03.400]   doesn't just say just point to me where not to go he doesn't say that because
[00:45:03.400 --> 00:45:08.680]   even when I know where it's not to go when I'm tempted I will go lead me not
[00:45:08.680 --> 00:45:15.760]   into temptation deliver me from evil this is an utter prayer of surrender
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:20.040]   that's the Lord's Prayer basically what Jesus was telling the disciples is to
[00:45:20.040 --> 00:45:26.640]   surrender come before God and be utterly dependent on him saturate your life with
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:32.960]   the Spirit of God that every single day we are saying it is you not me in Psalm
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:38.160]   27 some trust in chariots some horses but we trust in the name of the Lord our
[00:45:38.160 --> 00:45:44.680]   God seventh and finally the final reason and I think is the most important reason
[00:45:44.680 --> 00:45:52.080]   is that the whole point of salvation is our relationship with God if we call
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:57.880]   salvation reconciliation to be reconciled can you imagine if right now
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.880]   you know that North and North and South Korea you know they have all these
[00:46:00.880 --> 00:46:05.360]   tensions and and for the last 60 years a country was just torn in half can you
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:09.480]   imagine this is basically what happened in Korea you had people who basically
[00:46:09.480 --> 00:46:14.640]   during the Korean War was shuffled the whole country was shuffled around right
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:19.720]   young men were forcefully put into put into the Red Army and then they went up
[00:46:19.720 --> 00:46:25.520]   and they went down and then the parents and small children took up their kids
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:29.840]   and took a few bags they went down to the core they went up north back and
[00:46:29.840 --> 00:46:33.040]   forth so basically what happened was all the people in Korea got shifted around
[00:46:33.040 --> 00:46:36.840]   nobody was in their home their home got destroyed they were nowhere to go and
[00:46:36.840 --> 00:46:40.560]   then right in the middle of that they decided we're gonna split it right in
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.320]   half and so whoever got stuck on this side can never come back down this way
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:49.400]   and whoever got stuck in the south can never see the parents and children on
[00:46:49.400 --> 00:46:55.120]   this way I actually had a lady in my class when I used to teach ESL and she
[00:46:55.120 --> 00:46:58.920]   was probably in her mid 70s at that time she would probably in her 80 or 90s now
[00:46:58.920 --> 00:47:06.200]   but she was a widower and I so how long have you been a widow and a widow and
[00:47:06.200 --> 00:47:11.240]   basically she became a widow about two months after they got married so she was
[00:47:11.240 --> 00:47:15.840]   maybe in her early 20s 22 23 she got married and and the war broke out about
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.720]   two months after and her husband got forcefully dragged into the army and he
[00:47:20.720 --> 00:47:24.160]   was one of those guys being taken back and forth and when they decided to
[00:47:24.160 --> 00:47:27.680]   divide the country in half she was stuck on this side and he was stuck on that
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:32.200]   side and she never saw her husband again and she never remarried she never
[00:47:32.200 --> 00:47:35.920]   remarried one of the godliest ladies I've ever met she spent all her days
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:41.560]   just copying scripture you know she would just copy scripture you know and
[00:47:41.560 --> 00:47:45.040]   it wasn't just her the whole country experiences so you know you can
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:49.880]   understand that the previous generation why reunification meant everything to
[00:47:49.880 --> 00:47:55.480]   them because many of them lost everything can you imagine that your
[00:47:55.480 --> 00:48:00.560]   wife your you know you know that some of you guys may know the church in young
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:03.920]   knock in LA some of you guys know what that church is that big Korean church in
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:07.000]   LA the senior pastor who planted that church experienced the same thing when
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:11.040]   he was a young man the war broke out and he lost his wife he never saw his wife
[00:48:11.040 --> 00:48:15.520]   and then years later because he was a pastor of one of the largest church in
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:19.280]   here he's had an opportunity to go into North Korea found out his wife died a
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:23.960]   year before he came in the whole country I mean I'm just telling you one story of
[00:48:23.960 --> 00:48:29.320]   millions of story so you can imagine how important reunification is for a lot of
[00:48:29.320 --> 00:48:35.440]   the older people can you imagine if reunification finally one day happens
[00:48:35.440 --> 00:48:41.120]   and the 38th parallel is taken away all the landmines are taken out and said now
[00:48:41.120 --> 00:48:49.600]   we reunify now we can reconcile and nobody ever moves nobody makes a phone
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:55.520]   call it's like thank God it's open thank God it's open we need to praise the
[00:48:55.520 --> 00:49:00.280]   people who got together and was smart enough and to remove the barrier between
[00:49:00.280 --> 00:49:06.320]   us and thank God now we have the access and we're celebrating this open door but
[00:49:06.320 --> 00:49:13.320]   nobody goes to the other side the whole point of justification is to take away
[00:49:13.320 --> 00:49:20.080]   the barrier that we can draw near to the throne of grace with confidence what we
[00:49:20.080 --> 00:49:25.560]   could not do because of our sins Christ took it upon himself and he absorbed our
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:31.000]   sins and took away the landmines took away the wall took away the barrier and
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:40.920]   he says now come and then we watch and celebrate his work and we praise what he
[00:49:40.920 --> 00:49:49.840]   has done but nobody's going nobody's entering there's no affection for Christ
[00:49:49.840 --> 00:49:54.480]   there's no hungering for his presence there's no reaching out there's no
[00:49:54.480 --> 00:49:58.960]   crying out Baba father we thank you so much for doing what we did now what I
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:02.880]   could not do because of Christ now I can do I can come before you in prayer and
[00:50:02.880 --> 00:50:07.840]   you hear me and there's no barrier between me and you can you imagine the
[00:50:07.840 --> 00:50:13.160]   tragedy after that happens and everybody just watching each other and celebrating
[00:50:13.160 --> 00:50:19.120]   the open door and that's where it ends we can talk about the intricacies of the
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:28.840]   gospel or the blood of Christ we can have a PhD in Christology and in the end
[00:50:28.840 --> 00:50:34.480]   if you do not have a personal relationship with Christ it's all vanity
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:41.200]   it's for nothing the whole purpose of salvation is to bring us to him
[00:50:41.200 --> 00:50:47.000]   Ephesians 212 remember that you were a at that time separated from Christ
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:50.640]   alienated from the Commonwealth of Israel and strangers to the covenant as
[00:50:50.640 --> 00:50:56.040]   promised having no hope and without God in the world but now in Christ Jesus you
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:04.080]   who once were far off have been brought near by the blood of Christ our ultimate
[00:51:04.080 --> 00:51:11.800]   reason why we ought to pray is because we can because we can God who created us
[00:51:11.800 --> 00:51:17.560]   sustained says come to me and he's eagerly waiting for us so let me
[00:51:17.560 --> 00:51:24.640]   conclude with this as we continue on in 2016 that again and I'm not saying like
[00:51:24.640 --> 00:51:29.320]   this because I want you to all do what I do and become like me but as I evaluate
[00:51:29.320 --> 00:51:34.960]   my life and as I evaluate our church it is not just a shortfall it is a gaping
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:41.920]   hole that I see and I hope that in 2016 that together you know you encourage and
[00:51:41.920 --> 00:51:46.200]   challenge me and I will encourage and challenge you that this is something
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:51.440]   that we want to wrestle together that we would become a church of prayer in
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:56.840]   Jeremiah 29 13 so you will seek me and find me when you seek me with all your
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:02.240]   heart would you take a minute to again come before the Lord in prayer that
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:07.560]   again as we think upon 2016 and the things that we talk about like
[00:52:07.560 --> 00:52:14.600]   individually and as a community how can we become more a place of prayer house
[00:52:14.600 --> 00:52:19.640]   of prayer people of prayer and to really ask the Lord for his strength okay so as
[00:52:19.640 --> 00:52:23.680]   our worship team leads us let's take some time to pray
