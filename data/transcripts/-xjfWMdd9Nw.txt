[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   The prophet Isaiah tells us in Isaiah 65, 17
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   something pretty incredible. In the new creation, he says,
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   "The former things," the experiences of this life, it seems,
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000]   "The former things shall not be
[00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   remembered or come to mind."
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   And that raises a question about eternity. In the new creation,
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   are we mind-wiped? Two listeners are asking this
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   exact question, Pastor John, who joins us today remotely over Zoom.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Here's David, who lives in San Antonio, Texas.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   Hello, Pastor John. Praise God for you and for Tony and for your faithfulness to this
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   podcast over the years. I've searched the archive high and low and cannot find
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   your take on Isaiah 65, 17, which is exactly true.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   The text has never appeared on APJ, not until today.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So, does this passage effectively say that we will be
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   memory-wiped before we enter the new creation?
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And then a listener named Rylan wants to know how Isaiah
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   65, 17 jibes with Revelation 5, 12,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   which puts Christ's sacrifice, the past tense,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   "was slain," the memorial of his crucifixion in this world,
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   front and center for all of eternity. Pastor John, what do you
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   make of Isaiah 65, 17, and are my memories of
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   this life deleted in the new creation?
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   Well, here's the quote. Let's put Isaiah 65, 17
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   right in front of us so that we can be specific.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   "Behold, I create new heavens and
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:48.000]   new earth," God is speaking, of course, "and the former
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   things shall not be remembered
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   or come to mind." So, David is asking,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   does that mean a complete "memory wipe,"
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   like, I assume, the hard drive of our
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:08.000]   former life crashes and starts over as
[00:02:08.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   a totally blank slate?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   And my response is, there are numerous reasons
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   why it does not mean that.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   And if we think about a few of them, we will get
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   a clearer picture of what the Christian
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   eternal future will be like. So, first,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   in the immediately preceding verse, so verse 16
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   of Isaiah 65, God says of his servants,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   "He who takes an oath in the land shall swear by the God
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   of truth, because the former troubles
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   are forgotten and are hidden from our
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:56.000]   eyes." So, verse 17 says
[00:02:56.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   "former things shall not be
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   remembered," and verse 16 limits those things to former troubles.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   Now, that's a contextual warning to me,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   that we better be careful not to overstate
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   the forgetting of verse 17.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   It's probably not a memory wipe
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   of all former things, but a selective
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   memory wipe in some way.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So, that's just a little flag warning me,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   be careful here, don't overstate this,
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   or think of a total memory wipe of what it would mean.
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Think what it would mean. If you remember nothing
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   from your former life, you
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   are not you any longer. You have no
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   identity at all. There would be nothing
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   in your mind that could identify you as
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   you. In essence, a total memory wipe means
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:08.000]   you don't exist anymore as the person you were.
[00:04:08.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   And if you are to have any personhood at all, it would start
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   all over again, like a new creation. You'd be a new total person,
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and there would be no continuity with that former person
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   at all. But that contradicts several things we know from Scripture.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   It contradicts the parables of Jesus and the teachings
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   of the apostles that we will be rewarded in the age to come
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   according to our works in this life.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   So, there's a correlation or a continuity
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   between the person you are and what you did
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   in this world and the person you will be in the new
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   earth. A complete memory wipe also contradicts
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   the fact that we will recognize each other
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   in the age to come. The risen Christ
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   is the first fruits, Paul says. He's the
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   first fruits of that final resurrection
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   reality, and he relates to his disciples after the resurrection
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   as one that they know. We will know
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Jesus as the one who came into the world and worked
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   wonders and died for us and rose from the dead, and we will
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   know each other. All that assumes that our memories have not been
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   wiped out. Perhaps the most important
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   of all is the fact
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   that the ultimate purpose of history,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   the ultimate purpose of redemption from creation to
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   consummation, is the praise of the glory
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   of the grace of God. That's a quote from Ephesians 1:6.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:56.000]   God has worked in history
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   so that his wonders would be remembered
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:04.000]   and praised, especially the wonders of his
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   grace. Psalm 114. He has caused
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   his wonders, the wonderful works,
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:16.000]   to be remembered. The Lord is gracious
[00:06:16.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and merciful. God is not going to obliterate
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   the memory of his thousands of works
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   of grace as though they didn't matter.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:32.000]   On the contrary, according to Isaiah 63
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   7, God will "cause
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   to be remembered the steadfast love of the Lord,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   the great goodness of the house of Israel that he has granted them
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   according to his compassion." This is why Ryland's question
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   about Revelation 5.12 is relevant.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   He's right that the book of
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Revelation pictures the perfected saints in heaven
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   as singing the song of the Lamb.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   That's the Lamb that was slain at a point
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   in history at a place called Golgotha, worthy
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   as the Lamb who was slain to receive power and
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   wealth and wisdom and might and honor and glory and blessing.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   We're going to be singing that in the age to come. God did not
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   send his Son to die and just have
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:32.000]   his sacrifice be forgotten for all eternity.
[00:07:32.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   The death of Jesus was the high point of the glory of
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   the grace of God, and that's the point of the universe. The praise
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   of the glory of the grace of God. We will sing it
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   forever. We will not forget the high point of the grace of
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   God in this history, which means that the death
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   of Jesus will make sense forever, and the only way the
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   slaughter of the Son of God makes sense is to remember
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   sin. We have to remember sin,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   our sin. Christ died for our sin.
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   The most poignant expression of Paul's worship of Christ
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   it seems to me is Galatians 2.20. He loved me. Jesus
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:20.000]   loved me and gave himself for me. Do you think
[00:08:20.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   Paul won't say that forever? He loved me.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He gave himself for me. That poignant love
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   and thankfulness will not be memory wiped.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   It's the reason Christ died, to win for himself
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   everlasting songs of thankfulness and worship for his
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   bearing our guilt. Or consider the other
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   side of the coin. In the age to come, we will know that there is a reality
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:52.000]   called hell. The very last verse
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:56.000]   of Isaiah pictures the saints in the
[00:08:56.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   new age gazing on the defeated foes
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   of God. But the reality of hell would make no
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   sense if there were no memory of the outrage of sin
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   and no memory of the patience of God in this age.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   So, I conclude that Isaiah 65.17
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   does not mean that we are memory
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   wiped in the new heavens and the new earth,
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   which would cause David and Ryland to say
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   well then what does it mean? Okay, Biber, we get that.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   What you're saying, what does it mean when it says
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   Here's three observations that suggest
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   there is a kind of forgetting and there is a
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   kind of remembering that is different
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   from what we now experience. The Bible speaks
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   of God not remembering our sins
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   against us. I think that's a crucial
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   phrase. Psalm 79.8, do not remember
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   against us our former iniquities. Or
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Ezekiel 18.22, none of the transgressions that he
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   has committed shall be remembered against him.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   This is probably what the Bible regularly means
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   when it says that God will not remember our sins
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   like Isaiah 43.25. I will not remember your
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   sins. That is, God will not remember them
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   against us. He will not call them to mind
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   to in any way harm us or punish us.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   He does not cease to be God with perfect knowledge of
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   all reality, past, present, and future. So there
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   is a way to remember sin that is
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   very different from our present experience.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   Second, the Bible pictures us in
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   our eternal future as having fullness of joy.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   In your presence is fullness of joy. At your right hand are pleasures
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   forevermore. That means
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   no memories will ruin this joy.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   We may not be able to imagine how
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   any memory of all our sins
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   could serve our joy, but that leads me to my third
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   and last point about how forgetting and remembering
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   in the age to come will be different from how we
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   experience forgetting and remembering now. Paul
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   says in 1 Corinthians 13 12, "Now
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:52.000]   we see in a mirror dimly, but then face to face.
[00:11:52.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   Now I know in part, but then I shall know
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   fully, even as I have been fully known." In other words, there
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   is a way we know our sins now,
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and there's a different way we will
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   know our sins in the age to come. We will
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   know them as God knows them, as we are known.
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   We will be granted the capacity to see them as the reason why
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Christ died, and yet the effect
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   of that seeing, that remembering,
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   will be so changed that the pain of it,
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:36.000]   the guilt of it, the shame of it, will be
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   transformed into a pure, joyful
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   magnifying of the grace of God,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   which is why God made the world and sent Jesus
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   to save us. That's what he was after, the magnifying
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   of his grace. So I take
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   Isaiah 65 17, "The former things shall not be remembered or
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   come to mind," to mean in the new heavens and the new
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   earth, whatever God grants us to remember of
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   this world will only serve to
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   deepen our joy, the joy of worshipping Christ.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   Everything will be forgotten
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:24.000]   in the sense that everything that would hinder that worship
[00:13:24.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   will be excluded or transformed.
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   Fascinating. Thank you, Pastor John, and thank you for joining us today.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   If you want to ask Pastor John, email us your question.
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   Go to askpastorjohn.com
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   While male and female roles in the local church are clearly defined
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:48.000]   in the Bible, we would say they are clearly defined in the Bible,
[00:13:48.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   but are those roles equally as clear within a parachurch ministry
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   structure? Increasingly, parachurch organizations are saying
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   no, those rules do not apply to us. So do they.
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   That question is up next. I'm your host Tony Reinke. We'll see you back here on
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.000]   Monday. Thanks for listening.
