[00:12:27.620 --> 00:12:30.380]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:35.660]   First of all, our membership class,
[00:12:35.660 --> 00:12:37.500]   the new format of the membership class
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:41.060]   is starting at the end of July, July 26th.
[00:12:41.060 --> 00:12:43.100]   So it's gonna be, right?
[00:12:43.100 --> 00:12:45.500]   People are looking at me like I'm wrong.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:46.340]   July?
[00:12:46.340 --> 00:12:47.460]   - July 5th.
[00:12:47.460 --> 00:12:49.140]   - 5th, 5th, okay, my bad.
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:50.100]   Okay, July 5th.
[00:12:50.100 --> 00:12:51.540]   I thought I read 26.
[00:12:51.540 --> 00:12:52.460]   Okay, oh yeah, right, right.
[00:12:52.460 --> 00:12:54.340]   It's the early, the first July.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:56.660]   And so this is a completely revamped class.
[00:12:56.660 --> 00:13:00.620]   It's starting at nine o'clock to 1030 upstairs at the cafe.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:03.420]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:13:03.420 --> 00:13:04.660]   please sign up for that.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.740]   And what was the other announcement?
[00:13:05.740 --> 00:13:06.860]   I can't find my paper.
[00:13:06.860 --> 00:13:09.860]   Oh yes, that's July 26th.
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:11.100]   Okay, that's where I got mixed up.
[00:13:11.100 --> 00:13:13.300]   Okay, so July 26th, there is a members meeting
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:14.660]   that's gonna be taking place.
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.900]   And we're probably gonna,
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:18.780]   most likely gonna have it on Zoom again
[00:13:18.780 --> 00:13:21.460]   because we have more than half the church
[00:13:21.460 --> 00:13:22.500]   were not able to join us.
[00:13:22.500 --> 00:13:25.060]   So we're gonna have that online,
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:26.860]   I think it said 2.30, right?
[00:13:26.860 --> 00:13:28.540]   2.30 on July 26th.
[00:13:28.540 --> 00:13:30.300]   So please mark that on the calendar.
[00:13:30.300 --> 00:13:32.940]   And those are the only announcements that we have.
[00:13:32.940 --> 00:13:36.020]   And just, again, we wanna thank our sister Rachel Wong
[00:13:36.020 --> 00:13:39.060]   who started and finished and collected,
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:41.340]   did a great job with the online auction
[00:13:41.340 --> 00:13:42.780]   of all the stuff that came in.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:45.220]   And it was, yes, do it.
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:46.300]   If you're gonna do it, do it well.
[00:13:46.300 --> 00:13:48.220]   Okay, all right, thank you.
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:51.660]   It raised quite a bit of money, right?
[00:13:51.660 --> 00:13:54.180]   And I know some of you guys are bitter and angry.
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:56.940]   You're gonna have to deal with that for a while.
[00:13:56.940 --> 00:13:58.780]   And then some of you have to get extra jobs
[00:13:58.780 --> 00:13:59.940]   or wait for the stimulus check
[00:13:59.940 --> 00:14:01.820]   to be able to pay for some of this stuff.
[00:14:01.820 --> 00:14:05.140]   So it was out of control, but in a good way.
[00:14:05.140 --> 00:14:09.220]   Okay, so right now the needs for our Indian pastors
[00:14:09.220 --> 00:14:12.420]   in the village, the leaders and the evangelism
[00:14:12.420 --> 00:14:15.060]   that they're doing, so it's really,
[00:14:15.060 --> 00:14:17.920]   especially now, they're in need of help.
[00:14:17.920 --> 00:14:20.580]   And also for, you guys know what's going on in Ecuador
[00:14:20.580 --> 00:14:22.740]   and the churches and the children that you're supporting.
[00:14:22.740 --> 00:14:25.260]   So the money is going to be put into good use.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:28.280]   So if you're hurt in your pocket, that's a good hurt.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:29.780]   That's going to have eternal value.
[00:14:29.780 --> 00:14:32.980]   So again, we wanna thank you for all the labor for that.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:35.860]   Okay, just like we do every week, again,
[00:14:35.860 --> 00:14:36.940]   for those of you who are going to give
[00:14:36.940 --> 00:14:38.780]   the physical offering, just give it
[00:14:38.780 --> 00:14:40.900]   while you're coming in or going out.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:43.980]   But also for those who are giving electronically,
[00:14:43.980 --> 00:14:45.580]   we'll give you a minute for you to follow up
[00:14:45.580 --> 00:14:46.500]   on that as well, okay?
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:47.920]   So let me pray for us.
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.380]   And then we'll have a few minutes
[00:14:50.380 --> 00:14:52.180]   for the time of offering before we begin.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:53.020]   Let's pray.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:59.520]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for just your kindness.
[00:15:00.820 --> 00:15:03.360]   Lord, sometimes we take for granted the ability
[00:15:03.360 --> 00:15:05.700]   to be able to come into this nice room
[00:15:05.700 --> 00:15:08.220]   with air conditioning and audio system
[00:15:08.220 --> 00:15:12.260]   and not having to be fearful of persecution
[00:15:12.260 --> 00:15:15.420]   and bodily harm, and we know that's not the case
[00:15:15.420 --> 00:15:18.820]   with many of our brothers and sisters around the world.
[00:15:18.820 --> 00:15:21.420]   Help us to be good stewards of every good gift
[00:15:21.420 --> 00:15:25.860]   that you have given us, that our singing, our worship,
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:28.740]   even in our giving, Lord God, may reflect your kindness
[00:15:28.740 --> 00:15:30.100]   and goodness in our lives.
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:32.700]   I pray that you would anoint this time
[00:15:32.700 --> 00:15:35.300]   that our giving would be intentional
[00:15:35.300 --> 00:15:38.300]   and that it would be from the bottom of our hearts
[00:15:38.300 --> 00:15:42.020]   to signify lordship, that ultimately all of it
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:45.300]   belongs to you and may be multiplied for eternal purposes.
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:47.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:50.940]   (gentle piano music)

[00:23:47.540 --> 00:23:52.380]   - May I take a seat?
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:58.780]   All right, happy Father's Day.
[00:23:58.780 --> 00:24:02.060]   In case some of you guys did not know, right?
[00:24:02.060 --> 00:24:04.020]   It is Father's Day today, so hopefully you guys
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:06.780]   had something planned for your fathers.
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:09.220]   Normally, obviously, we have lunches and things like that
[00:24:09.220 --> 00:24:10.980]   prepared for Mother's Day and Father's Day,
[00:24:10.980 --> 00:24:12.900]   but we're not in normal times.
[00:24:12.900 --> 00:24:15.100]   So again, we just wanna thank you for the Father's Day.
[00:24:15.100 --> 00:24:17.060]   Pastor Mark actually put up a little poem
[00:24:17.060 --> 00:24:18.420]   that somebody wrote for the Father,
[00:24:18.420 --> 00:24:21.860]   so if you haven't read that yet, please read that, okay?
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:23.980]   If you can turn to Hebrews chapter seven,
[00:24:23.980 --> 00:24:28.980]   verse 26 through 28, and we're gonna be really spending
[00:24:28.980 --> 00:24:33.260]   most of the day on one verse, the first verse.
[00:24:33.260 --> 00:24:37.140]   But I wanna read that within that whole context,
[00:24:37.140 --> 00:24:38.980]   verse 26 through 28.
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:43.860]   For it is fitting for us to have such a high priest,
[00:24:43.860 --> 00:24:46.780]   holy, innocent, undefiled, separated from sinners
[00:24:46.780 --> 00:24:49.820]   and exalted above the heavens, who do not need daily
[00:24:49.820 --> 00:24:52.340]   like those high priests to offer up sacrifices,
[00:24:52.340 --> 00:24:55.580]   first for his own sins and then for the sins of the people,
[00:24:55.580 --> 00:24:59.060]   because this he did once for all when he offered up himself.
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:01.860]   For the law appoints men as high priests who are weak,
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.460]   but the word of the oath which came after the law
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:07.180]   appoints a son made perfect forever.
[00:25:07.180 --> 00:25:08.020]   Let's pray.
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:12.100]   Father, we pray for your anointing,
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.820]   we pray for your Holy Spirit to help us, guide us,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:18.940]   keep us sober and anchored in Christ.
[00:25:18.940 --> 00:25:21.580]   May your word go forth, convict our hearts
[00:25:21.580 --> 00:25:22.780]   and sanctify your church.
[00:25:22.780 --> 00:25:24.300]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:31.800]   You know, at church, we've been doing inductive Bible study.
[00:25:31.800 --> 00:25:33.700]   I mean, that's kinda like the backbone of our church
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:34.900]   since the beginning of the church,
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:37.600]   'cause we wanted the church to be Bereans.
[00:25:37.600 --> 00:25:38.900]   And that's where we get our name,
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.860]   because the Bereans were considered more noble
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:43.640]   because they tested to see if everything was biblical.
[00:25:43.640 --> 00:25:49.220]   If there's any time in the years that I've been in ministry
[00:25:49.220 --> 00:25:52.540]   where the church needs to be absolutely grounded
[00:25:52.540 --> 00:25:54.780]   and committed to the word of God, it is now.
[00:25:54.780 --> 00:25:57.760]   Because there are so many voices
[00:25:57.760 --> 00:26:00.420]   and so many different people, even within the church,
[00:26:00.420 --> 00:26:05.420]   demanding that we follow one direction or the other.
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:09.660]   And if we're not careful, we may find ourselves
[00:26:09.660 --> 00:26:11.900]   drifting with good intentions.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:14.700]   So if there's any time where we need to examine
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:17.900]   the scriptures carefully, that we may be anchored in Christ,
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:18.740]   it is now.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:22.820]   Remember I talked about how the Bible warns us
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:24.340]   about the second coming of Christ,
[00:26:24.340 --> 00:26:27.860]   and he gave us little things that we ought to be looking for
[00:26:27.860 --> 00:26:29.560]   so that we are not caught off guard,
[00:26:29.560 --> 00:26:31.420]   like thieves coming in the middle of the night.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:34.220]   And the reason why the Bible uses that illustration
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.800]   is when a thief comes into your house,
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:38.000]   you're not ready, nor do you want it.
[00:26:38.860 --> 00:26:42.080]   'Cause it's not a positive thing for a thief to come.
[00:26:42.080 --> 00:26:44.620]   So he tells the church not to be caught off guard,
[00:26:44.620 --> 00:26:46.460]   to stay sober and to be watchful.
[00:26:46.460 --> 00:26:51.980]   Well, Jesus tells us this in Matthew chapter 24
[00:26:51.980 --> 00:26:54.020]   about the end times, and these are some of the things
[00:26:54.020 --> 00:26:56.740]   that we ought to be sober and pay attention to.
[00:26:56.740 --> 00:26:58.220]   So if you look at that, it says,
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:26:59.700]   "And Jesus answered and said to them,
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:02.140]   "See to it that no one misleads you."
[00:27:02.140 --> 00:27:05.140]   One of the primary things that characterize
[00:27:05.140 --> 00:27:08.780]   the end times before he comes is misleading.
[00:27:08.780 --> 00:27:09.820]   There's gonna be deception.
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.860]   There's gonna be people in the name of Christ
[00:27:11.860 --> 00:27:14.540]   who are saying, "This is right and this is wrong."
[00:27:14.540 --> 00:27:16.080]   "For many will come in my name saying,
[00:27:16.080 --> 00:27:19.180]   "I am Christ and will mislead many."
[00:27:19.180 --> 00:27:21.460]   The reason why he says, "I am Christ,"
[00:27:21.460 --> 00:27:23.180]   at that time, they didn't have access
[00:27:23.180 --> 00:27:24.980]   to scripture like we do.
[00:27:24.980 --> 00:27:26.980]   They're not able to run to their scroll
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:28.740]   and then examine to see if what these people
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:30.000]   were saying was true.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:31.820]   If you believe that he was Christ,
[00:27:31.820 --> 00:27:34.260]   you just assume that he was speaking for God.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:36.060]   He was the scripture.
[00:27:36.060 --> 00:27:38.220]   So the modern day translation for that is say,
[00:27:38.220 --> 00:27:40.020]   when people say, "I am Christ,"
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.780]   they're basically saying, "I am speaking the truth.
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:42.960]   "I am biblical."
[00:27:42.960 --> 00:27:47.860]   So the deception is going to come within the church
[00:27:47.860 --> 00:27:49.000]   to mislead.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.420]   Verse six, "You will be hearing of wars
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:52.560]   "and rumors of wars.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:54.820]   "See that you are not frightened,
[00:27:54.820 --> 00:27:57.900]   "for those things must take place.
[00:27:57.900 --> 00:27:59.760]   "But that is not yet the end,
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:01.860]   "for nation will rise against nation
[00:28:01.860 --> 00:28:03.520]   "and kingdom against kingdom,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.060]   "and in various places there will be famines
[00:28:06.060 --> 00:28:08.180]   "and earthquakes."
[00:28:08.180 --> 00:28:10.740]   So if you notice, when he says that nation
[00:28:10.740 --> 00:28:12.220]   will rise against nation,
[00:28:12.220 --> 00:28:14.520]   the powerful countries,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:16.540]   the countries that have something to gain
[00:28:16.540 --> 00:28:17.540]   or something to lose,
[00:28:17.540 --> 00:28:19.240]   they will be in conflict, it says.
[00:28:19.240 --> 00:28:21.220]   But the poor countries will not be left out.
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:22.700]   They will experience famine
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:26.740]   and all kinds of earthly disasters.
[00:28:26.740 --> 00:28:29.760]   So this rumbling is not located in one area.
[00:28:29.760 --> 00:28:31.800]   It is worldwide.
[00:28:31.800 --> 00:28:34.660]   And if you've been paying attention to what's going on,
[00:28:34.660 --> 00:28:37.420]   you and I will admit
[00:28:38.180 --> 00:28:39.500]   that there is a rumbling going on.
[00:28:39.500 --> 00:28:40.900]   Maybe some of you guys who are younger
[00:28:40.900 --> 00:28:42.940]   may think that this is part of history,
[00:28:42.940 --> 00:28:44.660]   and it is to a certain extent.
[00:28:44.660 --> 00:28:46.620]   But I can tell you that during my lifetime
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:49.300]   I've never seen this, to this degree.
[00:28:49.300 --> 00:28:50.940]   I remember the last time there was a lot of talk
[00:28:50.940 --> 00:28:52.460]   about the second coming of Christ
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:54.620]   was at the turning of the millennium,
[00:28:54.620 --> 00:28:56.900]   year 2000, and simply because it was turning
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:28:58.020]   into a new millennium.
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:28:59.540]   And so there was a lot of talk about
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.540]   the coming of Christ and be watchful,
[00:29:01.540 --> 00:29:03.820]   and they were saying this is it, this is it.
[00:29:03.820 --> 00:29:06.620]   But that was purely because we were heading
[00:29:06.620 --> 00:29:07.980]   into a new millennium.
[00:29:07.980 --> 00:29:12.660]   What we see now, it may or may not be,
[00:29:12.660 --> 00:29:17.020]   but it does have indicators
[00:29:17.020 --> 00:29:19.060]   that resemble what we see in scripture.
[00:29:19.060 --> 00:29:21.380]   Verse nine, it says,
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.440]   "Then they will deliver you to tribulation."
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:26.300]   So after this rumbling happens,
[00:29:26.300 --> 00:29:28.300]   the next stage is gonna be a target
[00:29:28.300 --> 00:29:30.700]   toward genuine Christians.
[00:29:30.700 --> 00:29:32.580]   And they will kill you,
[00:29:32.580 --> 00:29:35.640]   and you will be hated by all the nations.
[00:29:35.640 --> 00:29:37.500]   That this persecution is not gonna be coming
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:39.840]   from one group of people.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.900]   It's not gonna be coming from one area
[00:29:41.900 --> 00:29:45.700]   or one political party.
[00:29:45.700 --> 00:29:48.020]   It's going to be international.
[00:29:48.020 --> 00:29:51.220]   He said, "All the nations, they will hate you
[00:29:51.220 --> 00:29:52.280]   "because of my name."
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.260]   And at that time, many will fall away.
[00:29:54.260 --> 00:29:55.460]   The church will be tested,
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:58.340]   and those who are hanging around
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.480]   and have never really counted the cost,
[00:30:00.480 --> 00:30:01.980]   that it was very easy,
[00:30:01.980 --> 00:30:04.900]   and all the effort that the church has made
[00:30:04.900 --> 00:30:07.060]   to bring as many people into the church
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.480]   are gonna fall out when that happens.
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:14.280]   He says, "And will betray one another
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:15.980]   "and hate one another."
[00:30:15.980 --> 00:30:19.220]   There's gonna be division that is so intense in the church
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:21.600]   that it's not simply gonna be division
[00:30:21.600 --> 00:30:23.120]   where we're gonna be going to different churches
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:24.240]   and saying different things.
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:26.160]   It says, "They will hate one another."
[00:30:26.160 --> 00:30:27.820]   It's not us against the world.
[00:30:27.820 --> 00:30:30.500]   It's the church within the church
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.600]   are gonna be throwing insults and hatred,
[00:30:32.600 --> 00:30:35.820]   and both sides are gonna think that they are right.
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.040]   And he says, "The church will be divided.
[00:30:38.040 --> 00:30:41.760]   "Many false prophets will arise and mislead many."
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:43.800]   That this is not isolated with a few
[00:30:43.800 --> 00:30:45.560]   and a few churches and a few groups.
[00:30:45.560 --> 00:30:48.420]   He said, "Many will fall out
[00:30:48.420 --> 00:30:51.520]   "because of lawlessness is increased."
[00:30:51.520 --> 00:30:55.400]   Lawlessness is increased.
[00:30:55.400 --> 00:30:56.440]   If you've been paying attention
[00:30:56.440 --> 00:30:58.400]   to what's going on right now,
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.840]   I think you and I will agree
[00:31:00.740 --> 00:31:02.940]   that lawlessness is increasing,
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:04.540]   and it is not isolated.
[00:31:04.540 --> 00:31:05.960]   This is worldwide.
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:09.380]   Most people love will grow cold
[00:31:09.380 --> 00:31:10.860]   because of lawlessness.
[00:31:10.860 --> 00:31:15.100]   But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.080]   The gospel of the kingdom shall be preached,
[00:31:17.080 --> 00:31:18.500]   that in the midst of this,
[00:31:18.500 --> 00:31:21.180]   there will be greater division,
[00:31:21.180 --> 00:31:23.660]   greater hatred, greater misleading,
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.340]   greater rumblings, greater trials,
[00:31:26.340 --> 00:31:29.180]   but there will be also greater preaching of the gospel.
[00:31:30.280 --> 00:31:31.840]   And he said, "When the gospel reaches
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:33.080]   "the remotest part of the world,"
[00:31:33.080 --> 00:31:35.960]   he says, "then I will come."
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:38.040]   And he said, "These things will happen."
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:39.840]   And he says, "Watch for it.
[00:31:39.840 --> 00:31:42.420]   "For false christs and false prophets will arise
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:44.520]   "and will show great signs and wonders,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.420]   "so to mislead."
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:52.300]   This misleading is so intense and so deep and so wide.
[00:31:52.300 --> 00:31:55.220]   He says, "If possible, even the elect."
[00:31:55.220 --> 00:31:57.120]   Now, when he says that, he's saying that,
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:31:59.440]   of course, the elect cannot be deceived.
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.900]   But what he is saying, that many people
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.680]   who we thought were elect,
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:08.920]   by their falling out, will prove that they were not.
[00:32:08.920 --> 00:32:10.800]   That's what that means.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:13.980]   It means that this division, this rumbling,
[00:32:13.980 --> 00:32:19.400]   this hatred is going to be intense.
[00:32:19.400 --> 00:32:24.160]   If there's any time right now
[00:32:24.160 --> 00:32:26.560]   where Christians need to ground themselves
[00:32:26.560 --> 00:32:29.280]   in the word of God, it is now.
[00:32:29.280 --> 00:32:30.720]   You cannot trust me.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.440]   I've been telling you that as long as you've been here.
[00:32:33.440 --> 00:32:38.680]   Because I could have the best intention and be wrong.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:41.560]   And that's why I keep telling you,
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:43.920]   examine the word of God,
[00:32:43.920 --> 00:32:46.760]   to make sure what I am saying is biblical,
[00:32:46.760 --> 00:32:49.380]   so that your confidence doesn't come from this pulpit.
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.720]   In fact, the greatest way to deceive you in this room
[00:32:52.720 --> 00:32:54.900]   is to deceive you from this pulpit.
[00:32:56.480 --> 00:33:00.560]   So, pay attention to what the word of God says.
[00:33:00.560 --> 00:33:01.400]   Be grounded.
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.560]   If there's any time where you need to be grounded
[00:33:03.560 --> 00:33:05.680]   in God's word, it is now.
[00:33:05.680 --> 00:33:09.840]   If you are not, if you're not daily walking with a God,
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:13.060]   your mind is not daily being renewed,
[00:33:13.060 --> 00:33:17.360]   let me just politely say, be quiet.
[00:33:17.360 --> 00:33:22.640]   Because you may be being influenced
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:25.840]   by misleading thoughts and not know it.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:30.640]   So, at best, it's best if you're not walking right with God
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:33.600]   and the word of God is not affecting you on a daily basis,
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.840]   to stay quiet.
[00:33:34.840 --> 00:33:37.040]   Even if you are walking right with God,
[00:33:37.040 --> 00:33:39.820]   it is not the best time to be speaking.
[00:33:39.820 --> 00:33:43.440]   Even a fool seems wise when he is silent.
[00:33:43.440 --> 00:33:49.200]   Ground yourself with the word of God and cling to him.
[00:33:49.200 --> 00:33:51.840]   Now, what does that have to do with the book of Hebrews?
[00:33:51.840 --> 00:33:54.380]   The whole letter is written to people
[00:33:54.380 --> 00:33:58.440]   who are in similar situation that you and I are in today,
[00:33:58.440 --> 00:33:59.840]   and much more intense.
[00:33:59.840 --> 00:34:03.240]   They, at one point, when the early start
[00:34:03.240 --> 00:34:04.520]   of the movement of Christianity,
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:06.920]   they jumped on board and they were high-fiving each other,
[00:34:06.920 --> 00:34:10.360]   visiting each other in prison, but it didn't die down.
[00:34:10.360 --> 00:34:12.560]   It got more intense.
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:15.680]   So, after about 20, 30 years passed by,
[00:34:15.680 --> 00:34:18.080]   their leaders, their early Christian leaders
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.920]   were actually being beheaded and crucified.
[00:34:20.920 --> 00:34:23.860]   So, it was no longer just this movement
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:26.440]   of God is doing something great.
[00:34:26.440 --> 00:34:28.840]   The Jews and the Gentiles are sitting together
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:30.840]   and sharing meals, this is awesome.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.320]   Well, the initial honeymoon of that has waned.
[00:34:35.320 --> 00:34:40.000]   And when Jesus said to pick up your cross,
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.520]   they're starting to realize that that's what he really meant.
[00:34:43.520 --> 00:34:45.360]   And when he said to count the cost,
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:48.080]   they're really starting to have to count the cost.
[00:34:48.080 --> 00:34:50.840]   And so, some of them were beginning to drift back
[00:34:50.840 --> 00:34:53.660]   into their old life, which happened to be Judaism.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.520]   Because that's where the persecution was coming from.
[00:34:57.520 --> 00:34:59.760]   That's where the difficulty was coming from.
[00:34:59.760 --> 00:35:01.440]   And so, they just kind of slided in.
[00:35:01.440 --> 00:35:04.240]   They didn't deny Christ, nor did they deny the world
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:05.800]   that they came from, and they were kind of
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:09.560]   straddling both fences, and that's why he says,
[00:35:09.560 --> 00:35:11.960]   you must not drift.
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:14.400]   And over and over again, he says, you must not drift.
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:16.440]   You have to be anchored in Christ,
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:18.460]   because when you drift, you won't even know
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:19.500]   that you're drifting.
[00:35:22.080 --> 00:35:25.300]   So, the situation that Paul, or the author of Hebrews,
[00:35:25.300 --> 00:35:29.820]   is speaking to is very similar to the danger
[00:35:29.820 --> 00:35:31.860]   that you and I are in right now.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:35.760]   Because there is so much confusion with so much voices,
[00:35:35.760 --> 00:35:38.260]   with so much passion being spoken
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:40.540]   that completely contradict each other.
[00:35:40.540 --> 00:35:45.600]   I have my opinions, but I'm not asking you
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:48.020]   to trust my opinions.
[00:35:48.020 --> 00:35:50.700]   I'm asking you to be grounded in God's word,
[00:35:50.700 --> 00:35:52.400]   anchor in Christ.
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.900]   See, Hebrews chapter 7, 26 starts out by saying,
[00:35:55.900 --> 00:35:59.940]   for it was fitting for us to have such a high priest.
[00:35:59.940 --> 00:36:03.420]   That language in English is very peculiar,
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:05.440]   because fitting seems so casual.
[00:36:05.440 --> 00:36:09.080]   That Jesus Christ, it was fitting.
[00:36:09.080 --> 00:36:12.560]   The word fitting means suitable, or proper, or right.
[00:36:12.560 --> 00:36:17.380]   For Jesus to be our high priest, that it was simply fitting.
[00:36:19.840 --> 00:36:22.760]   I don't know about you, but when I look at that,
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.160]   that's the furthest thing that I can think of
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.920]   about Christ's sacrifice for us.
[00:36:26.920 --> 00:36:30.240]   I mean, the son of God,
[00:36:30.240 --> 00:36:33.920]   dying for us?
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.780]   Son of God crucified for you, for me?
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:41.060]   That's fitting, that's right?
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:43.080]   In what universe could that be right?
[00:36:43.080 --> 00:36:46.680]   The just for the unjust?
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:51.060]   When will you ever see in our justice system,
[00:36:51.060 --> 00:36:55.500]   a just person taking the punishment of an unjust person,
[00:36:55.500 --> 00:36:57.160]   and that be celebrated?
[00:36:57.160 --> 00:37:01.380]   How could this be fitting?
[00:37:01.380 --> 00:37:07.620]   Well, the word fitting, and I think in the English,
[00:37:07.620 --> 00:37:09.720]   at least in the way that we understand it,
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:11.140]   doesn't necessarily fit.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:15.500]   I think that the better way for us to understand
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:18.280]   what he means by fitting, that it was necessary.
[00:37:18.280 --> 00:37:23.820]   That only Christ could fulfill that role as our mediator.
[00:37:23.820 --> 00:37:28.580]   It was necessary because he's the only one who qualifies.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:31.100]   It was necessary 'cause he's the only one.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:37.860]   There's only one mediator between us and God, Jesus Christ.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.900]   And so when he says it was fitting,
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:43.300]   a better way for you and I to understand it is,
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:44.960]   it was necessary.
[00:37:45.960 --> 00:37:49.280]   There was no other way that you and I would have had
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:53.160]   access to this holy God, other than for Christ
[00:37:53.160 --> 00:37:54.600]   to become our mediator.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:38:02.180]   In the very Lex 9, he actually describes what qualified him.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:05.760]   And so as we look at the meaning behind these words,
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:07.760]   what I want you to pay attention to is,
[00:38:07.760 --> 00:38:10.840]   as much as he's describing the qualification of Christ,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:15.140]   he's also describing what disqualifies us.
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:19.400]   And that's why it says, he is holy, innocent, undefiled,
[00:38:19.400 --> 00:38:22.140]   separated from sinners, and that's the whole point.
[00:38:22.140 --> 00:38:25.920]   He is unlike any other priest that came before him.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.000]   He is unlike any other priest that may come after him.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:32.040]   He is unlike any other human being that has ever lived.
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:36.680]   And that's why it was necessary for him to be high priest.
[00:38:36.680 --> 00:38:40.720]   So as we study these words, these three words,
[00:38:40.720 --> 00:38:43.260]   holy, innocent, and undefiled,
[00:38:43.260 --> 00:38:47.880]   remember, as much as Christ is being separated
[00:38:47.880 --> 00:38:50.940]   from the other high priest, remember that these
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:54.040]   are descriptions that disqualify every single one of us.
[00:38:54.040 --> 00:38:58.160]   He starts out by saying, the reason why it was necessary
[00:38:58.160 --> 00:39:00.240]   was that Jesus was holy.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:02.120]   He was innocent, he was undefiled.
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.580]   So if you read this casually, what you may get from that is,
[00:39:07.580 --> 00:39:09.160]   Jesus is holy, holy, holy.
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:14.120]   All three words basically means that he is perfect,
[00:39:14.120 --> 00:39:15.600]   he is pure.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:18.040]   And you may just move on without really thinking
[00:39:18.040 --> 00:39:19.680]   more than that.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:21.320]   Superficially, it's true.
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.760]   All these words on the surface is saying the same thing,
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:28.140]   that Jesus is perfect, he is holy, he is holy, he is holy.
[00:39:28.140 --> 00:39:32.400]   But there's a reason why he goes in depth.
[00:39:32.400 --> 00:39:36.440]   Now whenever we read scripture,
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:39.000]   we have to read scripture understanding
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.120]   that this was written by God himself.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:46.120]   There is no fluff in the word of God.
[00:39:46.120 --> 00:39:48.920]   I remember back in school,
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.960]   basically I was a Bible major undergrad,
[00:39:51.960 --> 00:39:55.560]   and then I studied, obviously, theology and seminary,
[00:39:55.560 --> 00:40:00.040]   and I took six, seven years just studying the Bible.
[00:40:00.040 --> 00:40:04.120]   And so most of what we do is just study the text
[00:40:04.120 --> 00:40:06.440]   and write papers, study the text and write papers.
[00:40:06.440 --> 00:40:09.060]   So just writing papers, I just pump out papers
[00:40:09.060 --> 00:40:10.920]   for seven, eight years, that's what I did.
[00:40:10.920 --> 00:40:15.720]   But I remember one of my professors would always say to us,
[00:40:15.720 --> 00:40:18.560]   if he didn't like your paper, he would write on the top,
[00:40:18.560 --> 00:40:21.520]   stop pumping sunshine in your paper.
[00:40:21.520 --> 00:40:25.600]   And what basically that means, if it was a 10-page project,
[00:40:25.600 --> 00:40:27.360]   that you have three pages of content
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:30.540]   and seven pages of fillers.
[00:40:30.540 --> 00:40:32.880]   Meaning you could have said that in three pages,
[00:40:32.880 --> 00:40:34.520]   but the seven pages was because
[00:40:34.520 --> 00:40:35.800]   you're trying to meet the requirement.
[00:40:35.800 --> 00:40:36.920]   And I'm sure some of you know
[00:40:36.920 --> 00:40:39.860]   exactly what I'm talking about, right?
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:40.960]   We know how to pump sunshine.
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   There is no sunshine in the word of God.
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:46.320]   The author is God.
[00:40:46.320 --> 00:40:49.280]   You and I could put all our energy,
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.320]   everything that we've studied,
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.400]   you can Google it and spend the rest of our life
[00:40:52.400 --> 00:40:56.400]   writing a letter to make it as perfect as we can,
[00:40:56.400 --> 00:40:59.900]   using the perfect vocabulary to gain all the wisdom
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.640]   that you and I can research and ask people
[00:41:02.640 --> 00:41:05.000]   and write this paper.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.240]   And we cannot come close to the depth of meaning
[00:41:08.240 --> 00:41:10.240]   of what the word of God says.
[00:41:10.240 --> 00:41:12.440]   Because this is an omniscient, omnipotent God
[00:41:12.440 --> 00:41:13.880]   who knows all things.
[00:41:13.880 --> 00:41:17.600]   Everything that Google, that you can search
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:20.040]   is only a drop in the bucket with what he knows.
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:24.840]   And in his wisdom, he used certain words.
[00:41:24.840 --> 00:41:26.800]   He used certain people, he used certain contexts,
[00:41:26.800 --> 00:41:29.880]   he used certain cultures to communicate with us
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:34.320]   his deep ideas, eternal thoughts.
[00:41:34.320 --> 00:41:38.400]   My point is, we should never read the scripture
[00:41:38.400 --> 00:41:39.480]   just casually.
[00:41:39.480 --> 00:41:42.360]   Just skim through it and read it and say,
[00:41:42.360 --> 00:41:44.760]   I've done it, I've done my Bible reading project.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.720]   We ought to dig, uncover, ask questions.
[00:41:48.720 --> 00:41:50.840]   That's why in the Inductive Bible Study,
[00:41:50.840 --> 00:41:52.600]   one of the first things that we learn, we teach,
[00:41:52.600 --> 00:41:54.160]   is you have to ask questions.
[00:41:54.160 --> 00:41:57.680]   Even if just one word, ask questions, ask 10 questions,
[00:41:57.680 --> 00:41:59.120]   even if it sounds ridiculous.
[00:41:59.120 --> 00:42:02.640]   Because the asking of the questions will uncover
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:04.040]   deep treasures in the Bible.
[00:42:04.040 --> 00:42:07.720]   Now I say all of this is set up,
[00:42:07.720 --> 00:42:11.220]   holy, innocent, undefiled on the surface may look the same,
[00:42:11.220 --> 00:42:12.700]   but it is very purposeful.
[00:42:12.700 --> 00:42:19.600]   As much as it describes the holiness of Christ,
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:24.600]   it also describes in depth the sins that disqualify us.
[00:42:24.600 --> 00:42:27.600]   If you look at the Old Testament,
[00:42:27.600 --> 00:42:28.900]   especially in the book of Leviticus,
[00:42:28.900 --> 00:42:31.840]   when God says to give offerings and sacrifices,
[00:42:31.840 --> 00:42:33.920]   he doesn't simply say, you've missed the mark,
[00:42:33.920 --> 00:42:35.560]   and so give these sacrifices.
[00:42:35.560 --> 00:42:40.560]   He was so specific of what that sin looks like.
[00:42:40.560 --> 00:42:45.960]   Your heart, your intention in the ceremony,
[00:42:45.960 --> 00:42:50.300]   at home, medically, things that you did on purpose,
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:52.720]   things that you did by accident,
[00:42:52.720 --> 00:42:56.160]   about the animals, about children, about families,
[00:42:56.160 --> 00:42:58.120]   about parents, about obedience.
[00:42:58.120 --> 00:42:59.640]   I mean, it is so accurate.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:02.080]   He doesn't simply say, you're guilty of sin.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:03.560]   He goes in depth.
[00:43:03.560 --> 00:43:10.000]   The purpose of all of that is that we recognize
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.380]   where we are in our relationship with this holy God.
[00:43:13.380 --> 00:43:17.140]   The word holy.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:20.840]   The typical word that you and I think of holy
[00:43:20.840 --> 00:43:22.640]   is the word agios.
[00:43:22.640 --> 00:43:27.720]   So oftentimes when we talk about the word holy,
[00:43:27.720 --> 00:43:28.560]   it says agios.
[00:43:28.560 --> 00:43:31.520]   Agios basically means, literally means to be set apart.
[00:43:31.520 --> 00:43:34.960]   The word set apart is a very general word.
[00:43:34.960 --> 00:43:38.540]   So an animal could be agios, holy,
[00:43:38.540 --> 00:43:40.640]   because it's set apart for God's use.
[00:43:40.640 --> 00:43:43.760]   A priest can be agios.
[00:43:43.760 --> 00:43:46.080]   He could be holy because he was set apart.
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.300]   So we have a holy priesthood.
[00:43:48.300 --> 00:43:50.480]   The gathering of the people are holy.
[00:43:50.480 --> 00:43:52.320]   The priesthood is holy.
[00:43:52.320 --> 00:43:54.480]   The items that are offered up that was used
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:55.400]   at the temple are holy.
[00:43:55.400 --> 00:43:56.680]   The temple itself is holy.
[00:43:56.680 --> 00:43:57.880]   The curtain is holy.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.840]   Anything that has been set apart for God's use is holy.
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:05.080]   So that could mean morally atonement,
[00:44:05.080 --> 00:44:08.280]   but it's a very general term to talk about
[00:44:08.280 --> 00:44:12.280]   something that has been set apart for God's use.
[00:44:12.280 --> 00:44:15.800]   So you and I are holy because we have been set apart
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:17.180]   and we are called his children,
[00:44:17.180 --> 00:44:20.160]   but that is not the word that is used here.
[00:44:20.160 --> 00:44:21.120]   It is not agios.
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:23.800]   The word he uses here is asios.
[00:44:23.800 --> 00:44:26.520]   And the word asios means obedience.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:32.760]   That you and I or whoever obeyed God's command perfectly.
[00:44:32.760 --> 00:44:39.760]   So asios, agios can be given to us freely.
[00:44:39.760 --> 00:44:41.820]   Asios is something that you have to earn.
[00:44:41.820 --> 00:44:46.380]   And so when he says he is asios,
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:48.400]   that not only was he set apart,
[00:44:48.400 --> 00:44:51.160]   but he was the only one who was perfectly holy.
[00:44:53.320 --> 00:44:54.660]   Perfectly obedient.
[00:44:54.660 --> 00:44:59.560]   A good example of that is we see it
[00:44:59.560 --> 00:45:01.400]   in the book of Leviticus chapter 10.
[00:45:01.400 --> 00:45:07.320]   After Aaron's two sons are anointed
[00:45:07.320 --> 00:45:10.360]   and cleansed, sprinkled with water,
[00:45:10.360 --> 00:45:13.600]   and they were considered holy because they were set apart
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:16.400]   to be the first priests to offer sacrifices.
[00:45:16.400 --> 00:45:21.320]   But they disobeyed God by offering strange fire.
[00:45:21.320 --> 00:45:22.960]   He didn't listen to what God said.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:23.840]   These are the prescriptions.
[00:45:23.840 --> 00:45:25.880]   These are the things that you need to do
[00:45:25.880 --> 00:45:28.800]   in order for you to be able to come before me.
[00:45:28.800 --> 00:45:30.760]   And they didn't follow it.
[00:45:30.760 --> 00:45:31.720]   But this, they disobeyed.
[00:45:31.720 --> 00:45:35.320]   So they were agios, but they weren't asios.
[00:45:35.320 --> 00:45:40.400]   And as a result, they see the capital punishment.
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:43.200]   Romans 15, four says,
[00:45:43.200 --> 00:45:45.560]   "Who will not fear, O Lord, and glorify your name?
[00:45:45.560 --> 00:45:47.360]   "For you alone are holy."
[00:45:47.360 --> 00:45:50.960]   The word you alone are holy is asios.
[00:45:51.920 --> 00:45:55.840]   We all together are agios 'cause we have been set apart.
[00:45:55.840 --> 00:45:59.080]   But he says Christ alone is asios.
[00:45:59.080 --> 00:46:01.680]   You know, if you're a Jew, the word without defect
[00:46:01.680 --> 00:46:02.960]   would have been ringing in your ears
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.360]   when it came to the temple.
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:06.480]   Because over and over again in the book of Leviticus,
[00:46:06.480 --> 00:46:09.440]   you will see the term without defect, without defect.
[00:46:09.440 --> 00:46:11.840]   And it's not just referring to the animals.
[00:46:11.840 --> 00:46:16.880]   The method had to be perfect.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:21.120]   Who touched what?
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:22.960]   Only they could touch it.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.040]   What animals?
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:25.520]   What kind of animals?
[00:46:25.520 --> 00:46:27.480]   How much of these animals?
[00:46:27.480 --> 00:46:29.040]   He was so precise.
[00:46:29.040 --> 00:46:31.560]   They had to be without defect,
[00:46:31.560 --> 00:46:33.760]   the method, the location, the animal.
[00:46:33.760 --> 00:46:36.000]   But out of all of them,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   the priests had to be without defect.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:41.320]   Leviticus 21, 21.
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.920]   "No man among the descendants of Aaron,
[00:46:42.920 --> 00:46:44.760]   "the priest who has a defect,
[00:46:44.760 --> 00:46:47.600]   "is to come near to offer the Lord's offering by fire
[00:46:47.600 --> 00:46:49.040]   "since he has a defect.
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:52.000]   he shall not come near to offer the food of his God."
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:47:00.320]   If you believe that this is the way to get to God,
[00:47:00.320 --> 00:47:04.900]   what a tremendous burden. Who can fulfill this?
[00:47:04.900 --> 00:47:12.180]   You make even one mistake. You know people joke about having, you know, Asian parents that A is not enough.
[00:47:12.180 --> 00:47:14.980]   You have to be A+, and if you get A+, you have to A++,
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:20.260]   and you get A++, you have to get A+++. You can never satisfy
[00:47:20.260 --> 00:47:27.880]   these Asian parents. I don't think Asians are the only ones guilty of that, but that's where the typically the joke is.
[00:47:27.880 --> 00:47:34.840]   I mean, it makes Asian parents look like the gracious people in the world.
[00:47:34.840 --> 00:47:38.780]   You have to use the right pen,
[00:47:38.780 --> 00:47:41.060]   the right paper,
[00:47:41.060 --> 00:47:42.620]   the right ruler,
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:47.580]   the right seat at the right time, and the right penmanship.
[00:47:47.580 --> 00:47:53.180]   And you can't, you can't get 99.9% right,
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:59.020]   because the moment that you get that 1% wrong, you're defected.
[00:47:59.020 --> 00:48:02.940]   If this was the way to get to God,
[00:48:02.940 --> 00:48:06.580]   who can worship this God?
[00:48:06.580 --> 00:48:12.600]   But that was not the point. The whole point of all of this was the point to somebody who was going to fulfill all of
[00:48:12.600 --> 00:48:14.300]   this, and
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:16.380]   that's why he says it was necessary,
[00:48:16.380 --> 00:48:20.140]   because no man could fulfill this.
[00:48:20.140 --> 00:48:28.140]   No man could be without defect. No method could be perfect. No location, no animal is perfect.
[00:48:28.140 --> 00:48:30.540]   That's why it was necessary
[00:48:30.540 --> 00:48:35.020]   for Christ to be our mediator. Now, we can stop right there,
[00:48:35.020 --> 00:48:42.180]   because that alone disqualifies every human being that has ever been born on this earth.
[00:48:43.120 --> 00:48:49.700]   Past, present, and future. And we can move on just from that and say, "Okay, we're done. We need Christ."
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:53.420]   But the Bible is much more accurate than that.
[00:48:53.420 --> 00:48:59.740]   And then he says, "Not only is he athias, he is innocent." And the word there is akakas.
[00:48:59.740 --> 00:49:04.580]   In the King James, it's translated "harmless" or "blameless."
[00:49:04.580 --> 00:49:07.880]   Literal translation is "without evil."
[00:49:08.040 --> 00:49:12.880]   Whenever you see in the Greek the word "a" in front of a word, the "a" basically means "without."
[00:49:12.880 --> 00:49:15.220]   So,
[00:49:15.220 --> 00:49:17.640]   akakas is "evil." So, "without evil."
[00:49:17.640 --> 00:49:25.560]   You know what's really interesting about this word is that the theologians believe the application of this word literally means to not be
[00:49:25.560 --> 00:49:27.800]   duplicitous.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:30.960]   That in your doing good,
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:33.840]   somebody who is akakas
[00:49:33.840 --> 00:49:37.880]   always has some evil in it.
[00:49:38.880 --> 00:49:40.760]   Meaning,
[00:49:40.760 --> 00:49:43.120]   every human being in every good endeavor,
[00:49:43.120 --> 00:49:49.480]   because of our fallen nature, there is some coveting. There is some self-righteousness.
[00:49:49.480 --> 00:49:52.280]   There is some wanting glory.
[00:49:52.280 --> 00:49:54.920]   There is some retribution.
[00:49:54.920 --> 00:50:00.120]   There is some pride that always taints every good thing that we do.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:03.880]   And only Christ is completely akakas.
[00:50:05.120 --> 00:50:10.560]   Without evil. And that's what it means that He is separated from all the other human beings.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.600]   Because you and I do not qualify.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:16.680]   Even at our best attempt,
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:20.520]   it is with our fallen nature that we do what we do.
[00:50:20.520 --> 00:50:25.080]   You know, the perfect example of that is found in Matthew chapter 16, 22 to 23.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:31.280]   This is right after Jesus tells Peter, "Who do men say that I am?" And Peter gives the right answer.
[00:50:32.400 --> 00:50:36.160]   And then Jesus says, "Upon this rock I will build my church." So he's flying high.
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:38.480]   And then in the very next passage, Jesus says,
[00:50:38.480 --> 00:50:41.120]   "I'm going to go to the cross."
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.840]   And Jesus and Peter, with his good intention,
[00:50:45.840 --> 00:50:49.240]   and you have to remember that Peter loved Jesus.
[00:50:49.240 --> 00:50:53.240]   He was not just some casual fan of Christ.
[00:50:53.240 --> 00:50:59.480]   He was in his heart willing to die. I believe that he was willing to die.
[00:51:00.640 --> 00:51:02.640]   And that's what he was doing at the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:51:02.640 --> 00:51:05.760]   But look what he says.
[00:51:05.760 --> 00:51:09.000]   Peter took him aside and began to rebuke Jesus and saying,
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:13.040]   "God forbid it, Lord. This shall never happen to you."
[00:51:13.040 --> 00:51:16.560]   I mean, it's because he loved Him.
[00:51:16.560 --> 00:51:24.320]   Not only does he say that, he says, "It's not going to happen to you. Even if they all fall away, I will not.
[00:51:24.320 --> 00:51:28.160]   I'm going to stay loyal to you, and I'll fight till death. If you die, I die."
[00:51:28.160 --> 00:51:30.640]   And I think Peter meant it with all his heart.
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:34.480]   But even in his good attempt,
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:38.080]   there's pride.
[00:51:38.080 --> 00:51:42.640]   He's tainted with evil in his heart.
[00:51:42.640 --> 00:51:46.960]   There's self-confidence, self-glory,
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:51.200]   that all the other disciples were wrestling with, and Jesus rebukes him.
[00:51:51.200 --> 00:51:54.320]   Says to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:51:54.320 --> 00:51:57.200]   Satan.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:51:59.200]   Even in his loyalty.
[00:51:59.200 --> 00:52:02.720]   Even in his attempt to do good.
[00:52:02.720 --> 00:52:08.400]   Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:52:08.400 --> 00:52:13.360]   Can you imagine how shocking this must have been for Peter?
[00:52:13.360 --> 00:52:16.800]   I said this because I love you.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:21.360]   I said this because I'm literally willing to die for you.
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:28.000]   I can't speak for the other disciples, but I will go to death with you, for you.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:32.560]   And Jesus says, "No, that's satanic."
[00:52:32.560 --> 00:52:36.160]   He doesn't just say, "Peter, you missed the point.
[00:52:36.160 --> 00:52:42.640]   You missed the mark. You didn't come all the way." He says, "No, it's satanic." And he describes why.
[00:52:42.640 --> 00:52:45.440]   "You are a stumbling block to me,
[00:52:45.440 --> 00:52:49.040]   for you are not setting your mind on God's interest, but man's."
[00:52:51.200 --> 00:52:53.200]   What is the man's interest that he's talking about?
[00:52:53.200 --> 00:52:55.520]   Jesus.
[00:52:55.520 --> 00:52:57.520]   As the man.
[00:52:57.520 --> 00:52:59.760]   He was trying to preserve his friend.
[00:52:59.760 --> 00:53:02.960]   He was trying to fight for his friend.
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:08.560]   And he said, "It's satanic because you're concerned about my flesh."
[00:53:08.560 --> 00:53:13.520]   That's not why I came. I came to die.
[00:53:13.520 --> 00:53:20.640]   God came for the spiritual redemption of mankind. That's what he means.
[00:53:21.440 --> 00:53:23.440]   That in your attempt to do good,
[00:53:23.440 --> 00:53:27.040]   you deny the cause of Christ.
[00:53:27.040 --> 00:53:30.080]   So that's what it means, "kakas,"
[00:53:30.080 --> 00:53:32.800]   without evil.
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:34.900]   That even in our best endeavors,
[00:53:34.900 --> 00:53:37.680]   we have been tainted by sin.
[00:53:37.680 --> 00:53:40.960]   So if Christ is the only one,
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:44.160]   that is without defect,
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:51.280]   there is no hidden motive behind him, that all that even when it seems to be no good, that only Christ is good,
[00:53:51.280 --> 00:53:55.760]   the best and the safest place for you and I to be is to be where he is.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:59.120]   Do what he does.
[00:53:59.120 --> 00:54:00.880]   Say what he says.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:02.880]   Go where he goes.
[00:54:02.880 --> 00:54:08.160]   That we do not make our own cause and then cry out to God to join us.
[00:54:08.160 --> 00:54:12.640]   That we see what his cause is and we join him.
[00:54:13.280 --> 00:54:15.280]   That even in our very causes,
[00:54:15.280 --> 00:54:18.400]   we are tainted with "kakas."
[00:54:18.400 --> 00:54:22.880]   Matthew chapter 9, 1 through 6.
[00:54:22.880 --> 00:54:29.440]   People come to Christ with a friend that they have who is lame.
[00:54:29.440 --> 00:54:33.280]   Break, open his house, put him down.
[00:54:33.280 --> 00:54:36.480]   I mean, they took a risk messing up someone's house.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:41.280]   They cut the line with many people who are there and they're there because they're desperate.
[00:54:42.320 --> 00:54:45.300]   So you can imagine the pain of the paralytic.
[00:54:45.300 --> 00:54:49.040]   And they want to help their friend.
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:52.000]   So again, it was no small task.
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:56.320]   That even if we get yelled at, even if we get put to jail, even if we get stoned,
[00:54:56.320 --> 00:54:58.960]   I'm going to help my friend.
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:05.360]   So you can imagine the suffering of that individual and the friends who are coming alongside to help him,
[00:55:05.360 --> 00:55:07.600]   but Jesus doesn't heal him. What does he say?
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:10.800]   Your sins are forgiven.
[00:55:11.680 --> 00:55:13.680]   Because they didn't understand.
[00:55:13.680 --> 00:55:15.680]   They didn't thank him.
[00:55:15.680 --> 00:55:18.880]   We did all of this and that's it.
[00:55:18.880 --> 00:55:20.880]   And who are you?
[00:55:20.880 --> 00:55:22.880]   How dare you even say that?
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:26.480]   In response to that, he says in verse 5,
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:30.880]   "Which is easier to say, 'Your sins are forgiven,' or to say, 'Get up and walk.'
[00:55:30.880 --> 00:55:36.880]   But so that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on earth to forgive sins."
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.880]   Then he said to the paralytic, "Get up, pick up your bed, and go home."
[00:55:42.880 --> 00:55:46.880]   He fed the poor. He opened the eyes of the blind.
[00:55:46.880 --> 00:55:52.880]   And he raised paralytics all for this purpose.
[00:55:52.880 --> 00:55:58.560]   So that mankind may know that he came to forgive sins.
[00:55:58.560 --> 00:56:03.780]   Because man's problem is not his, is not being paralytic.
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   His greatest problem is not hunger.
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:11.840]   His greatest problem is not racism.
[00:56:11.840 --> 00:56:16.480]   It's much deeper than that.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:20.480]   Those are only symptoms.
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:29.440]   That's why we need to pay attention.
[00:56:29.440 --> 00:56:33.520]   Examine the scriptures.
[00:56:33.600 --> 00:56:36.560]   That even in the context of doing good,
[00:56:36.560 --> 00:56:40.240]   that we have kakas in us.
[00:56:40.240 --> 00:56:43.840]   Only Christ is a kakas.
[00:56:43.840 --> 00:56:47.360]   Third and finally, he says he is undefiled.
[00:56:47.360 --> 00:56:51.360]   And again, without defilement.
[00:56:51.360 --> 00:56:54.400]   And that same word is being used in Hebrew chapter 13, 5,
[00:56:54.400 --> 00:56:58.080]   saying that, "Do not defile the marriage bed."
[00:56:58.080 --> 00:57:00.880]   And so the word basically means
[00:57:01.520 --> 00:57:04.240]   Christ, "Asias," that he is obedient.
[00:57:04.240 --> 00:57:07.760]   Externally, he did everything that God told him to do.
[00:57:07.760 --> 00:57:10.720]   Internally, he is without defect, without sin.
[00:57:10.720 --> 00:57:13.260]   Externally and internally.
[00:57:13.260 --> 00:57:18.560]   And then the third word, "undefiled," means that he continues to remain in that position forever.
[00:57:18.560 --> 00:57:22.240]   You see how precise this is? It covers everything.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:26.160]   It covers your external obedience, it covers your internal obedience,
[00:57:26.160 --> 00:57:28.960]   and it covers the continual obedience.
[00:57:29.680 --> 00:57:31.680]   Without defect.
[00:57:31.680 --> 00:57:36.720]   The guilt offering in the Old Testament,
[00:57:36.720 --> 00:57:39.920]   of the five major offerings,
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:42.960]   was when somebody dedicated,
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:49.920]   let's say an animal to be dedicated and to be given as a sacrifice, it became agyos, it became holy.
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:58.720]   But an individual inadvertently defiles that animal, that person who gave the offering now can't offer that animal.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:07.040]   So the guilt offering basically called the man to basically give sacrifice to atone for his sin, but also
[00:58:07.040 --> 00:58:12.480]   to compensate for the damage that he's done by giving an extra 20%.
[00:58:12.480 --> 00:58:16.240]   I mean, it's very precise.
[00:58:16.240 --> 00:58:20.800]   So the whole offering was, if you defile someone else's offering,
[00:58:20.800 --> 00:58:25.360]   you have to give them and compensate them along with repenting for your own sins.
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:30.160]   But what defiled that animal?
[00:58:30.160 --> 00:58:35.040]   Obviously the animal was without defect when they brought it to the temple,
[00:58:35.040 --> 00:58:38.400]   but what would defile the animal?
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:45.360]   Because if it was already defiled, he wouldn't be able to bring it to the temple to begin with.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:50.640]   The animal gets defiled when he
[00:58:51.440 --> 00:58:58.800]   is declared without defect and he is dedicated to the Lord and another defiled human being touches it.
[00:58:58.800 --> 00:59:03.520]   That's how the animal gets defiled.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:07.300]   And so they can no longer use that animal for sacrifice.
[00:59:07.300 --> 00:59:10.800]   It was the human touch
[00:59:10.800 --> 00:59:13.200]   that defiled that animal.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:18.240]   You know, one of the best explanations of this is found in the book of
[00:59:19.280 --> 00:59:25.120]   The Holiness of God, if you've read that. There's a section on that that describes about the punishment that Uzzah got.
[00:59:25.120 --> 00:59:28.560]   After David gets anointed as king,
[00:59:28.560 --> 00:59:33.280]   the Ark of the Covenant is with the Philistines and so he sends people to go get it.
[00:59:33.280 --> 00:59:39.700]   And Uzzah is on that team and he gets it. And as they are bringing the cart back, the Ark of the Covenant
[00:59:39.700 --> 00:59:45.520]   slips and Uzzah reaches over and he touches it to keep it balanced so that it doesn't fall to the ground.
[00:59:45.520 --> 00:59:48.640]   God's anger is burned.
[00:59:49.200 --> 00:59:51.200]   And as a result, Uzzah dies.
[00:59:51.200 --> 00:59:54.080]   And it doesn't explain, it just moves on.
[00:59:54.080 --> 00:59:59.760]   I remember reading that for the first time thinking, how is this fair?
[00:59:59.760 --> 01:00:03.520]   Uzzah was actually trying to help.
[01:00:03.520 --> 01:00:09.680]   Uzzah was trying to straighten this out so that the Ark of the Covenant would not get dirty.
[01:00:09.680 --> 01:00:14.720]   And he went all the way over there to get it.
[01:00:17.120 --> 01:00:22.720]   I think R.J. Sproul does the best job describing this because I remember years ago when I read Holiness for the first time,
[01:00:22.720 --> 01:00:26.400]   it was paradigm shifting.
[01:00:26.400 --> 01:00:34.240]   Because by that time I was already several years as a pastor and I've given sermons on holiness. I've memorized scriptures on holiness.
[01:00:34.240 --> 01:00:39.760]   You know, he would evangelize by saying that we've offended a holy God. So I've been talking about this.
[01:00:39.760 --> 01:00:42.640]   But it didn't hit me the way
[01:00:42.640 --> 01:00:46.000]   that it hit me when I realized to the depth.
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   Of my sins and who God is.
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   So I understand.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.960]   If you've been at a church
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:57.760]   and you know, you kind of read it, you skim through it, but you don't really understand the gravity of this.
[01:00:57.760 --> 01:01:00.960]   I think R.J. Sproul does the best job.
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:04.720]   He says in his book on that chapter about that event,
[01:01:04.720 --> 01:01:09.360]   we must ask the question, what was the Ark doing on an ox cart in the first place?
[01:01:10.160 --> 01:01:16.160]   God was so strict about the holy things of the temple that the Kohothites were not even allowed to gaze upon the Ark.
[01:01:16.160 --> 01:01:18.560]   This too was a capital crime.
[01:01:18.560 --> 01:01:25.440]   God had decreed that if a Kohothite merely glanced at the Ark in the Holy of Holies for an instant that he would die.
[01:01:25.440 --> 01:01:30.160]   Not only was Uzzah forbidden to touch the Ark, he was forbidden even to look at it.
[01:01:30.160 --> 01:01:32.400]   He touched it anyway.
[01:01:32.400 --> 01:01:34.720]   He stretched out his hand and put it squarely on the Ark,
[01:01:35.100 --> 01:01:41.820]   steadying it in place lest it fall to the ground. An act of holy heroism? No.
[01:01:41.820 --> 01:01:48.700]   It was an act of arrogance, a sin of presumption. Uzzah assumed that his hand was less polluted than the Earth.
[01:01:48.700 --> 01:01:52.140]   But it wasn't the ground or the mud that would desecrate the Ark.
[01:01:52.140 --> 01:01:56.540]   It was the touch of man. The Earth is an obedient creature.
[01:01:56.540 --> 01:02:00.300]   It does what God tells it to do. It brings forth its yield in its season.
[01:02:00.380 --> 01:02:05.680]   It obeys the laws of nature which God has established. When the temperature falls to a certain point, the ground freezes.
[01:02:05.680 --> 01:02:12.540]   When water is added to dust, it becomes mud, just as God decided. The ground doesn't commit cosmic treason.
[01:02:12.540 --> 01:02:20.140]   There is nothing polluted about the ground. God did not want his holy throne to be touched by that which was contaminated by evil.
[01:02:20.140 --> 01:02:25.420]   That which was in rebellion to him, that which by its ungodly revolt had brought
[01:02:25.740 --> 01:02:32.860]   the whole of creation to ruin and cause the ground and the sky and the waters of the sea to groan together in travail
[01:02:32.860 --> 01:02:35.100]   waiting for the day of redemption.
[01:02:35.100 --> 01:02:39.280]   Man, it was man's touch that was forbidden.
[01:02:39.280 --> 01:02:46.720]   Only Christ is undefiled.
[01:02:46.720 --> 01:02:51.980]   No human being can stand before a holy God
[01:02:51.980 --> 01:02:54.140]   and live.
[01:02:54.140 --> 01:02:59.440]   In Jeremiah 6, 14 to 15, before the Assyrians come and take Israel to captivity,
[01:02:59.440 --> 01:03:04.960]   Jeremiah pleads with the nation of Israel. And one of the constant themes of the book of Jeremiah
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:10.380]   is that they have taken the sins of my people lightly.
[01:03:10.380 --> 01:03:14.300]   And you see that phrase repeated over and over again.
[01:03:14.300 --> 01:03:20.540]   They have healed the brokenness of my people, superficially saying, "Peace, peace," but there is no peace.
[01:03:22.380 --> 01:03:25.580]   And then he describes, "Were they ashamed because of the abomination they have done?
[01:03:25.580 --> 01:03:30.460]   They were not even ashamed at all. They did not even know how to blush.
[01:03:30.460 --> 01:03:34.060]   Therefore, they shall fall among those who fall."
[01:03:34.060 --> 01:03:38.540]   See, they're crying out for peace.
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:43.100]   But God says there is no peace. There will be no peace.
[01:03:43.100 --> 01:03:46.540]   Until there is an answer for sin.
[01:03:47.500 --> 01:03:49.500]   [silence]
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:04:00.940]   People today are shocked because they've seen racism on videos.
[01:04:00.940 --> 01:04:07.180]   Racism has always been.
[01:04:07.180 --> 01:04:14.140]   But the problem with mankind goes much deeper than what you have seen.
[01:04:16.460 --> 01:04:18.460]   Much deeper than that.
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:23.900]   What you are seeing on video that is different than maybe 10, 15 years ago,
[01:04:23.900 --> 01:04:27.840]   it's being blasted on video everywhere, but mankind has not changed.
[01:04:27.840 --> 01:04:35.440]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God. The condition of man has not changed.
[01:04:35.440 --> 01:04:41.660]   The problem that we see now is much deeper than what you have seen.
[01:04:41.660 --> 01:04:46.140]   People ask me,
[01:04:46.780 --> 01:04:48.940]   "Why did you stop doing homeless ministry?"
[01:04:48.940 --> 01:04:56.140]   I mean, you thought you and your wife Esther thought that you were going to do that full time and that
[01:04:56.140 --> 01:04:58.300]   you hated the church and all that was true.
[01:04:58.300 --> 01:05:00.460]   But why did you stop?
[01:05:00.460 --> 01:05:06.140]   I remember
[01:05:06.140 --> 01:05:07.980]   years ago,
[01:05:07.980 --> 01:05:11.020]   I was out on the street and I saw this lady, a middle-aged lady,
[01:05:11.020 --> 01:05:14.460]   and she had two young kids. One girl,
[01:05:15.500 --> 01:05:17.420]   one boy,
[01:05:17.420 --> 01:05:21.660]   and what I remember about those two kids were like this bright brown eyes.
[01:05:21.660 --> 01:05:25.100]   So cute,
[01:05:25.100 --> 01:05:27.100]   so intelligent.
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:32.220]   But they were living out of their mom's truck and this wasn't a truck that had the, you know, the
[01:05:32.220 --> 01:05:35.900]   camping thing in the background. It was just, you know, the two-seater in the front.
[01:05:35.900 --> 01:05:41.660]   That's where they were at. The mom was in the driver's seat and the other two kids on that and that's where they were living.
[01:05:43.660 --> 01:05:45.660]   So I felt bad
[01:05:45.660 --> 01:05:49.580]   and I said, "You know what? Why don't you come with me? I'm going to get you a hotel room.
[01:05:49.580 --> 01:05:54.940]   We'll pay for your stay. We'll buy you food and then send your kids to school.
[01:05:54.940 --> 01:06:00.380]   Send your kids to school and then maybe hopefully we can help you get on your feet and then,
[01:06:00.380 --> 01:06:03.980]   you know, we'll provide whatever it is that you need." So she agreed.
[01:06:03.980 --> 01:06:07.020]   She came with us,
[01:06:07.020 --> 01:06:09.500]   put her in a hotel near where we were living at that time,
[01:06:10.140 --> 01:06:15.580]   and I would come and check up on her every once in a while and about a week to a week and a half passed
[01:06:15.580 --> 01:06:18.140]   and I get a phone call from the motel
[01:06:18.140 --> 01:06:21.660]   and she said, "You need to come here because the lady won't open her door."
[01:06:21.660 --> 01:06:25.180]   So I go and I knock on the door
[01:06:25.180 --> 01:06:27.740]   and when she hears my voice,
[01:06:27.740 --> 01:06:30.780]   she finally opens and I opened and it was
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:33.340]   disaster.
[01:06:33.340 --> 01:06:35.340]   She was a hoarder.
[01:06:35.340 --> 01:06:38.700]   So she had trash piled up above her knees.
[01:06:39.580 --> 01:06:41.580]   So it was at the height of the bed
[01:06:41.580 --> 01:06:44.220]   and I was shocked
[01:06:44.220 --> 01:06:47.260]   because there's no way they could have created this trash in that short time.
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:50.380]   She must have brought it in from outside. So something was not well with her.
[01:06:50.380 --> 01:06:54.940]   So I convinced her, "Let the ladies come in and clean up. That's all you need to do.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:56.940]   Just leave for 10 minutes, let them clean up." And
[01:06:56.940 --> 01:06:59.420]   she agreed,
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:03.420]   cleaned it up, and I asked her, "Just let them come in and do that. You don't have to do it."
[01:07:03.420 --> 01:07:09.340]   Another week goes by and I get a phone call and he said, "The lady hasn't let us into the room for the last
[01:07:09.500 --> 01:07:11.340]   week."
[01:07:11.340 --> 01:07:13.340]   I go back to check up on her
[01:07:13.340 --> 01:07:16.060]   and I open the door, same thing.
[01:07:16.060 --> 01:07:18.620]   Then I asked her to do that and she said, "Okay."
[01:07:18.620 --> 01:07:22.300]   And then the very next day she packed up her bags and she disappeared.
[01:07:22.300 --> 01:07:25.340]   The kids were gone.
[01:07:25.340 --> 01:07:27.980]   And I was so broken
[01:07:27.980 --> 01:07:30.620]   for those kids.
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:37.020]   I've seen plenty of ladies like her out on the street during that time, but these two kids were bright young kids
[01:07:37.420 --> 01:07:40.940]   who were just following the mom around, just sleeping in their truck.
[01:07:40.940 --> 01:07:45.580]   And I couldn't help her.
[01:07:45.580 --> 01:07:48.540]   I remember another guy named Rolando.
[01:07:48.540 --> 01:07:52.940]   He was a Cuban African-American guy that I met out on the street.
[01:07:52.940 --> 01:07:56.620]   He was funny, he was charismatic,
[01:07:56.620 --> 01:07:59.660]   but he was an alcoholic.
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.060]   I invited him to come and he felt bad.
[01:08:02.060 --> 01:08:06.300]   So he said, "Can I stay at the church?" And not at this church, but the previous church
[01:08:06.300 --> 01:08:08.140]   I was serving at in Irvine.
[01:08:08.140 --> 01:08:11.420]   And so he stayed at the church. He stayed there for months and months.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:18.940]   And so our church guys would take him out to eat, buy him stuff, but after a few months
[01:08:18.940 --> 01:08:24.460]   we would see him disappear and then find him in bars, completely drunk, out of control.
[01:08:24.460 --> 01:08:27.500]   And then I'd have to reprimand him and then the next
[01:08:27.500 --> 01:08:31.980]   week or so he'd be fine. And then after that, same pattern over and over again.
[01:08:31.980 --> 01:08:34.300]   And after about two, three months of that, he ended up leaving.
[01:08:35.660 --> 01:08:37.660]   And I couldn't help him.
[01:08:37.660 --> 01:08:42.380]   Remember I told you that I was out on the street for a few days because I wanted to see what it was like?
[01:08:42.380 --> 01:08:45.180]   If I'm going to work with the homeless, I need to know what it's like.
[01:08:45.180 --> 01:08:47.820]   There was a guy named Angel.
[01:08:47.820 --> 01:08:50.700]   His name was Angel.
[01:08:50.700 --> 01:08:59.260]   He was a ex-gang member, a drug addict that I met out on the street. He became a Christian while he was in prison.
[01:08:59.260 --> 01:09:02.620]   So he came out and I met him and I befriended him.
[01:09:03.740 --> 01:09:06.940]   And we were good enough friends where I would invite him to church and he would come
[01:09:06.940 --> 01:09:11.580]   on the weekend. I would go pick him up, hit up church, and then I would take him back to his
[01:09:11.580 --> 01:09:14.220]   housing that he got.
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:18.700]   And so when I was out on the street, he was the one who took care of me.
[01:09:18.700 --> 01:09:23.260]   And that's why I was able to go out because him and another friend
[01:09:23.260 --> 01:09:27.420]   basically stuck with me the whole time, all three days. He's the one who took me to the shelter,
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:30.860]   to the food lines, and showed me what was going on.
[01:09:32.460 --> 01:09:36.940]   But after a while, Angel couldn't kick his crack at it.
[01:09:36.940 --> 01:09:44.380]   So he would disappear for two, three months and then he would show back up at Santa Ana.
[01:09:44.380 --> 01:09:46.940]   And I said, "Angel, where were you?"
[01:09:46.940 --> 01:09:50.460]   And he was embarrassed, but he told me I was in jail.
[01:09:50.460 --> 01:09:56.700]   I said, "What happened?" He's like, "Yeah, I fell. I got back on with crack."
[01:10:00.140 --> 01:10:03.340]   He went through that for about a year, year and a half before he disappeared.
[01:10:03.340 --> 01:10:09.580]   And I didn't know where he went. I just assumed that he did something more serious and he got sentenced to jail.
[01:10:09.580 --> 01:10:15.420]   Again, this is before cell phones. This is before internet. So once they disappeared, they disappeared.
[01:10:15.420 --> 01:10:18.220]   I can tell you story after story after story
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:21.360]   of frustration after frustration after frustration.
[01:10:21.360 --> 01:10:28.140]   The story that to me stands out the most, remember I shared with you, I had a
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:32.700]   a guy that I met out on the street. He slept with us in our house for a while.
[01:10:32.700 --> 01:10:35.660]   His name was Michael Lee.
[01:10:35.660 --> 01:10:38.300]   He has an Asian name, but he was an African-American guy.
[01:10:38.300 --> 01:10:44.220]   So I met him out on the street and you know, you would never know he's homeless. He was homeless.
[01:10:44.220 --> 01:10:47.260]   He's another guy who went to prison
[01:10:47.260 --> 01:10:49.820]   because of drugs, came out, he cleaned himself up.
[01:10:49.820 --> 01:10:53.740]   And Esther and I were just talking about him just a few days ago.
[01:10:53.740 --> 01:10:57.900]   And the thing that we remember the most about Michael is he smelled like soap.
[01:10:58.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   Because he was so clean. He was constantly
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.420]   like washing.
[01:11:03.420 --> 01:11:06.780]   I don't know. I never really put it together that maybe maybe I
[01:11:06.780 --> 01:11:09.020]   I you know
[01:11:09.020 --> 01:11:11.020]   if I was to psychoanalyze him
[01:11:11.020 --> 01:11:14.380]   that he constantly felt dirty because he couldn't kick
[01:11:14.380 --> 01:11:17.180]   the cocaine out of it.
[01:11:17.180 --> 01:11:19.260]   But he
[01:11:19.260 --> 01:11:23.180]   was at our church and I was with him for almost a year and a half, two years.
[01:11:23.180 --> 01:11:26.060]   Brought him to church.
[01:11:26.140 --> 01:11:32.140]   Some of our old, old Korean members know, again, I'm not talking about our church member, that when I say old I literally mean old.
[01:11:32.140 --> 01:11:38.540]   They loved him because you know, we used to play so much basketball and he was good at it.
[01:11:38.540 --> 01:11:41.900]   He was our best rebound. He played like Dennis Rodman.
[01:11:41.900 --> 01:11:44.540]   You know, he was the trash guy.
[01:11:44.540 --> 01:11:50.540]   Who picked up everything, he hustled like crazy and he would give it to the shooters. I like to shoot so I liked him.
[01:11:52.700 --> 01:11:58.380]   So our church guys bought him basketball shoes because it was his birthday. He was about two, three years older than I was.
[01:11:58.380 --> 01:12:03.580]   But they went too far. You know, this is a guy who was struggling with crack and they bought him
[01:12:03.580 --> 01:12:09.180]   Michael Jordan's and I remember it was ridiculous amount. It was like 160, 170 dollars.
[01:12:09.180 --> 01:12:13.980]   They bought it from because they they loved it. They loved the fact that we he's there and he's getting off of drugs and
[01:12:13.980 --> 01:12:17.740]   then he would just disappear.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:25.420]   And I was so frustrated with him because I was doing discipleship and he'd be doing fine for a while.
[01:12:25.420 --> 01:12:27.900]   Remember I told you I got pulled over by a cop
[01:12:27.900 --> 01:12:30.940]   with an African-American friend. It was Michael.
[01:12:30.940 --> 01:12:38.060]   So in order to help him, I told him to come into my house
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.440]   so that we can watch him, keep him accountable.
[01:12:41.440 --> 01:12:44.780]   This is before we had kids.
[01:12:44.780 --> 01:12:47.260]   Well, they gave him that shoe
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:50.460]   and a few days later he disappeared for two weeks.
[01:12:50.460 --> 01:12:57.900]   After two weeks, I said man, what's going on with Michael, you know, and I went out to Santa Ana looking for him
[01:12:57.900 --> 01:13:01.660]   and I knew it had to be something with drugs because he was constantly struggling with that.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:04.800]   Two weeks later, he showed up at my house barefoot
[01:13:04.800 --> 01:13:09.680]   and he was older than me, but he was crying like a baby.
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.460]   He was crying because he couldn't kick his habit.
[01:13:18.460 --> 01:13:23.420]   Man, I wanted to be charismatic.
[01:13:23.420 --> 01:13:28.940]   I wanted to just lay hands and just cast that out of him.
[01:13:28.940 --> 01:13:35.260]   I felt completely helpless
[01:13:35.260 --> 01:13:38.220]   because he was with me for two years.
[01:13:38.220 --> 01:13:41.580]   I loved that guy.
[01:13:41.580 --> 01:13:44.460]   So every time he did that,
[01:13:45.020 --> 01:13:48.940]   it was like a good friend that I couldn't bring out of the mud.
[01:13:48.940 --> 01:13:53.580]   Eventually,
[01:13:53.580 --> 01:13:55.260]   I had to send him home,
[01:13:55.260 --> 01:13:57.260]   which was in Virginia.
[01:13:57.260 --> 01:13:59.580]   We bought him bus tickets to go home.
[01:13:59.580 --> 01:14:05.580]   And again, this is before the internet. This is before cell phones. So I would get letters every once in a while
[01:14:05.580 --> 01:14:08.060]   and he told me he found a job
[01:14:08.060 --> 01:14:10.140]   and the job had some sort of a drug program
[01:14:10.700 --> 01:14:15.100]   where they would move him from place to place so that he doesn't get comfortable and find drugs.
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:18.620]   And he would send me every time. He's like, "Hey, I'm doing well.
[01:14:18.620 --> 01:14:23.180]   You know, thanks for your support." And this was going on for about maybe about a year or so.
[01:14:23.180 --> 01:14:27.980]   Then he just started disappearing and I stopped hearing from him and I just assumed
[01:14:27.980 --> 01:14:30.780]   that he started struggling with drugs again.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:36.620]   The problem of mankind
[01:14:36.620 --> 01:14:40.300]   is not something you and I can fix.
[01:14:40.780 --> 01:14:45.420]   You and I do not have that power. It is the arrogance of man to think
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.460]   that if we just work harder,
[01:14:48.460 --> 01:14:50.460]   if we are better united,
[01:14:50.460 --> 01:14:53.580]   if we put better policy, that we can fix this problem.
[01:14:53.580 --> 01:14:57.900]   You know, so many people can say, "Oh, we got to stop the sex trafficking."
[01:14:57.900 --> 01:15:01.020]   Yeah, I mean,
[01:15:01.020 --> 01:15:03.020]   if that doesn't burn your heart
[01:15:03.020 --> 01:15:06.700]   and bring you to tears, there's something wrong with you.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:14.460]   But the way that we go about helping is, "Oh, we're going to go and we're going to deliver them from these evil men."
[01:15:14.460 --> 01:15:18.220]   What they don't realize
[01:15:18.220 --> 01:15:24.300]   is that majority of these young girls are coming out of their villages voluntarily.
[01:15:24.300 --> 01:15:33.660]   They walk into where these Westerners are and offering up their bodies because that's the only way they can eat.
[01:15:36.780 --> 01:15:43.980]   And we think that if we just eradicate these bad men, that that will take care of the problem.
[01:15:43.980 --> 01:15:53.420]   The fallenness of where you and I are is much deeper and greater
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.540]   than you and I could possibly imagine.
[01:15:56.540 --> 01:15:59.760]   So when the Bible says that it was necessary
[01:15:59.760 --> 01:16:03.020]   for Christ to come,
[01:16:03.020 --> 01:16:05.020]   it means he is the only way.
[01:16:06.460 --> 01:16:08.460]   He is the only way
[01:16:08.460 --> 01:16:13.820]   that we can even make a dent on what you and I see.
[01:16:13.820 --> 01:16:21.420]   The years of frustration of trying to help people, I realize I don't have the power.
[01:16:21.420 --> 01:16:25.900]   What is foolishness to man
[01:16:25.900 --> 01:16:28.860]   is the power of God.
[01:16:28.860 --> 01:16:31.500]   Christ crucified.
[01:16:31.500 --> 01:16:34.220]   That's what Paul means.
[01:16:34.700 --> 01:16:36.700]   They seek for signs
[01:16:36.700 --> 01:16:38.780]   and the other look for wisdom.
[01:16:38.780 --> 01:16:41.180]   But we preach Christ crucified.
[01:16:41.180 --> 01:16:47.260]   Foolishness to those who are perishing, but the power of God for those who are being saved.
[01:16:47.260 --> 01:16:51.420]   So as we are stirred by what's going on around us,
[01:16:51.420 --> 01:16:55.820]   do not run to the same hope that the world is running to.
[01:16:55.820 --> 01:17:00.060]   Do not run to the same things that they think are going to fix this.
[01:17:01.020 --> 01:17:09.020]   It should remind us even further to get back to what God called us to begin with, to go make disciples of all the nations,
[01:17:09.020 --> 01:17:13.260]   baptizing them in the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit,
[01:17:13.260 --> 01:17:17.900]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you and lo, I am with you to the end of the age.
[01:17:17.900 --> 01:17:22.080]   We speak of coming to Christ so casually
[01:17:22.080 --> 01:17:30.000]   because the church has in the last three, four decades have tried so hard to make God so accessible
[01:17:30.460 --> 01:17:33.500]   to as many people as possible and they have completely
[01:17:33.500 --> 01:17:36.300]   presented the wrong God.
[01:17:36.300 --> 01:17:43.500]   Exodus 32 verse 33 verse 20, but he said, "You cannot see my face for no man can see me and live."
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:46.300]   Deuteronomy 5 25, "Now when they should,
[01:17:46.300 --> 01:17:53.580]   why should we die? For this great fire will consume us if we hear the voice of the Lord our God any longer, then we will die."
[01:17:53.580 --> 01:17:58.220]   They didn't see God's presence as something to be welcomed
[01:17:59.020 --> 01:18:01.020]   because they knew who he was.
[01:18:01.020 --> 01:18:05.740]   They were trembling in fear when God told them to come. They said, "If we go we might die."
[01:18:05.740 --> 01:18:13.340]   Even when Moses came up and just glory, a reflection of his glory brought fear to the nation of Israel
[01:18:13.340 --> 01:18:15.660]   and they begged him to stay in the tent
[01:18:15.660 --> 01:18:20.940]   because the reflection of God's holiness scared them to death.
[01:18:20.940 --> 01:18:27.020]   1 Samuel chapter 5 verse 10, the Philistines wanted the ark to be gone
[01:18:27.740 --> 01:18:29.740]   because everywhere the ark went
[01:18:29.740 --> 01:18:32.800]   people broke out in cancer and tumors.
[01:18:32.800 --> 01:18:36.060]   So they didn't welcome the ark.
[01:18:36.060 --> 01:18:39.180]   David, not knowing as a young king,
[01:18:39.180 --> 01:18:43.740]   thought we're going to bring this presence of God and God's going to bless us again and he learned
[01:18:43.740 --> 01:18:46.380]   to the death of Uzzah
[01:18:46.380 --> 01:18:48.620]   to not to take lightly.
[01:18:48.620 --> 01:18:53.260]   And that's why in Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5 when Isaiah is confronted with God's holiness
[01:18:53.260 --> 01:18:57.260]   he doesn't say, "Thank you for showing me your glory." That was not his response.
[01:18:58.220 --> 01:19:01.980]   He broke down and he says, "Woe is me for I am ruined
[01:19:01.980 --> 01:19:08.860]   because I am a man of unclean lips and I live among people of unclean lips.
[01:19:08.860 --> 01:19:13.900]   For my eyes have seen the king, the Lord of hosts. He saw that he wasn't holy.
[01:19:13.900 --> 01:19:18.800]   He saw that he was defiled."
[01:19:18.800 --> 01:19:23.920]   That's what he means when he says it was necessary.
[01:19:23.920 --> 01:19:25.920]   Necessary.
[01:19:25.920 --> 01:19:34.000]   Our fight is not against flesh and blood.
[01:19:34.000 --> 01:19:39.760]   If there's any time that we need to be reminded of this is right now.
[01:19:39.760 --> 01:19:43.360]   Right now.
[01:19:43.360 --> 01:19:46.960]   Our fight is not against flesh and blood.
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:52.260]   It is against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of darkness,
[01:19:52.560 --> 01:19:55.540]   the spiritual forces of wickedness in the heavenly places.
[01:19:55.540 --> 01:19:59.600]   You're not going to go into battle
[01:19:59.600 --> 01:20:02.800]   to conquer demons
[01:20:02.800 --> 01:20:05.280]   simply by yelling
[01:20:05.280 --> 01:20:08.080]   and by organizing
[01:20:08.080 --> 01:20:10.800]   and by screaming.
[01:20:10.800 --> 01:20:17.760]   If there's anything that we are served to do now more than ever is to be the light.
[01:20:20.400 --> 01:20:22.880]   Make the hope of Christ clear.
[01:20:22.880 --> 01:20:33.200]   Let the world where it's hurting know there's hope in the name of Jesus Christ and Jesus only.
[01:20:33.200 --> 01:20:36.720]   Let's pray.
[01:20:36.720 --> 01:20:46.880]   Heavenly Father,
[01:20:46.880 --> 01:20:49.600]   we need you desperately.
[01:20:50.480 --> 01:20:52.480]   Lord,
[01:20:52.480 --> 01:20:58.560]   so many people are hurting, crying out.
[01:20:58.560 --> 01:21:03.360]   And I know, Father God, that
[01:21:03.360 --> 01:21:08.320]   you saw the hurting world and you had compassion and that's why all of us are here.
[01:21:08.320 --> 01:21:12.400]   Help us to show that compassion
[01:21:12.400 --> 01:21:16.400]   by deed and by words.
[01:21:18.560 --> 01:21:21.760]   Help us, Lord God, not to be indifferent to the suffering of sinners.
[01:21:21.760 --> 01:21:28.340]   But in the midst of that, help us never forget
[01:21:28.340 --> 01:21:32.800]   why you came.
[01:21:32.800 --> 01:21:37.360]   Help us to be your ambassadors and be a light, especially now
[01:21:37.360 --> 01:21:41.360]   that we would not turn from your word to the left or to the right.
[01:21:41.360 --> 01:21:46.640]   With all the confusing voices, Lord God, even coming from within the church,
[01:21:47.920 --> 01:21:49.920]   help us to hear your Son's voice
[01:21:49.920 --> 01:21:53.360]   and only his voice that we may follow him.
[01:21:53.360 --> 01:22:00.580]   May it be a great opportunity for revival. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[01:22:03.540 --> 01:22:05.540]   [Music]
[01:22:05.540 --> 01:22:07.540]   [Music]

[01:22:09.540 --> 01:22:11.540]   [Music]
[01:22:11.540 --> 01:22:33.060]   Hope is built on nothing less Than Jesus' blood and righteousness
[01:22:33.060 --> 01:22:40.060]   The sweetest bread, but wholly laid On Jesus' lap
[01:22:40.060 --> 01:22:49.460]   Across the solid rock I stand All other ground is sank in sand
[01:22:49.460 --> 01:22:55.060]   All other ground is sank in sand
[01:22:55.060 --> 01:23:11.060]   [Instrumental]
[01:23:11.060 --> 01:23:20.060]   When darkness veils His lovely face I rest on His unchanging grace
[01:23:20.060 --> 01:23:29.060]   In every high and stormy vale My anchor holds with faith
[01:23:29.060 --> 01:23:39.060]   On Christ the solid rock I stand All other ground is sank in sand
[01:23:39.060 --> 01:23:44.060]   All other ground is sank in sand
[01:23:44.060 --> 01:24:01.060]   [Instrumental]
[01:24:01.060 --> 01:24:10.060]   His covenant, His blood Support me in the well You flood
[01:24:10.060 --> 01:24:19.060]   When all around my soul is wet It is all my mistake
[01:24:19.060 --> 01:24:29.060]   On Christ the solid rock I stand All other ground is sank in sand
[01:24:29.060 --> 01:24:33.060]   All other ground is sank in sand
[01:24:33.060 --> 01:24:43.060]   On Christ the solid rock I stand All other ground is sank in sand
[01:24:43.060 --> 01:24:48.060]   All other ground is sank in sand
[01:24:48.060 --> 01:25:03.060]   [Instrumental]
[01:25:03.060 --> 01:25:09.060]   He shall come, He shall come with trumpet sound
[01:25:09.060 --> 01:25:18.060]   Oh may I then in Him be found Dressed in His righteousness alone
[01:25:18.060 --> 01:25:28.060]   Faithless to stand before the throne On Christ the solid rock I stand
[01:25:28.060 --> 01:25:38.060]   All other ground is sank in sand All other ground is sank in sand
[01:25:38.060 --> 01:25:42.060]   [Instrumental]
[01:25:42.060 --> 01:25:52.060]   On Christ the solid rock I stand All other ground is sank in sand
[01:25:52.060 --> 01:25:59.060]   All other ground is sank in sand
[01:25:59.060 --> 01:26:01.060]   [Instrumental]
[01:26:01.060 --> 01:26:06.060]   Our benediction is going to come from Hebrews chapter 7 verse 27 and 28
[01:26:06.060 --> 01:26:12.060]   Why does not, who does not need daily like those high priests to offer up sacrifices
[01:26:12.060 --> 01:26:15.060]   First for his own sins and then for the sins of the people
[01:26:15.060 --> 01:26:19.060]   Because he did once for all when he offered up himself
[01:26:19.060 --> 01:26:22.060]   For the law appoints men as high priests who are weak
[01:26:22.060 --> 01:26:28.060]   But the word of the oath which came after the law appoints a son made perfect forever
[01:26:28.060 --> 01:26:32.060]   Heavenly Father we pray for your grace to be sufficient this week
[01:26:32.060 --> 01:26:36.060]   Lord we are weak men and women who are desperately in need of you
[01:26:36.060 --> 01:26:39.060]   Even just to be sober Lord God rest of today
[01:26:39.060 --> 01:26:44.060]   So we ask Lord God that the Holy Spirit that you've deposited in us
[01:26:44.060 --> 01:26:46.060]   Would continue to groan on our behalf
[01:26:46.060 --> 01:26:48.060]   Where Christ may be exalted
[01:26:48.060 --> 01:26:51.060]   Help us Lord God not to be moved, not to drift
[01:26:51.060 --> 01:26:54.060]   But to be firmly anchored in Christ and His word this week
[01:26:54.060 --> 01:27:00.060]   May His grace, His love and His power and fellowship consume us in all that we do
[01:27:00.060 --> 01:27:02.060]   Amen
[01:27:03.060 --> 01:27:07.060]   God sent His Son
[01:27:07.060 --> 01:27:12.060]   They called Him Jesus
[01:27:12.060 --> 01:27:17.060]   He came to love
[01:27:17.060 --> 01:27:21.060]   Heal and forgive
