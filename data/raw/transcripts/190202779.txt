[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 8, we read verse 12,
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:16.560]   13, so I'm going to read again from 12 through 17, but our main text this morning is verses
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:20.880]   12 through 13.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:24.720]   So then brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh, but
[00:00:24.720 --> 00:00:28.080]   if you live according to the flesh you will die.
[00:00:28.080 --> 00:00:31.780]   But if by the Spirit you put to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:00:31.780 --> 00:00:34.800]   For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.920]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:00:38.920 --> 00:00:42.680]   the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:00:42.680 --> 00:00:46.880]   The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:50.680]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:55.080]   suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:00.280]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:04.200]   We thank you Lord God that you have sustained us again this week.
[00:01:04.200 --> 00:01:08.160]   We pray Father that your word will continue to open our eyes to see the reality of the
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:10.440]   spiritual battle that we are in.
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:15.760]   Help us not to live day to day nonchalantly, just making it through week by week.
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:20.760]   Help us to be purposeful in the spiritual battle, to win the lost, to fight against
[00:01:20.760 --> 00:01:26.560]   sin, to encourage and strengthen your church, that we may glorify you in every opportunity
[00:01:26.560 --> 00:01:27.960]   that you give.
[00:01:27.960 --> 00:01:32.840]   Help us Lord God that this morning, that what we are unable to do in our flesh, that your
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:35.360]   Holy Spirit will do Father by strengthening your church.
[00:01:35.360 --> 00:01:39.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:44.720]   Now the two verses that we read this morning, it's of great significance because again it
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:48.760]   is a challenge to put our sins to death.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:53.400]   We have a tendency if we're not careful to be passive participants on sanctification
[00:01:53.400 --> 00:01:57.640]   that if you're justified, that if you just kind of coast through, that sanctification
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:59.680]   is just going to happen.
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:05.020]   You know one of the greatest books that I've read as a pastor was by a name named John
[00:02:05.020 --> 00:02:10.000]   Owens, and the title of the book was "Reformed Pastors," very rebuking and challenging at
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.600]   the same time.
[00:02:11.600 --> 00:02:16.800]   That book is probably not as well known as this book, "The Mortification of Sin" by
[00:02:16.800 --> 00:02:19.000]   that same author John Owens.
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:25.200]   And his book "Mortification of Sin" is really based upon these two particular verses, this
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:30.600]   series of sermons that he gave on these two verses about why it is necessary for us to
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:36.760]   fight against sin, that we're not just passively waiting for sanctification to happen.
[00:02:36.760 --> 00:02:42.640]   I want to read you a couple passages from his book before we jump into the text and
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:45.400]   explain.
[00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:49.120]   One of the quotes he says, "Mortification of indwelling sin, remaining in our mortal
[00:02:49.120 --> 00:02:53.160]   bodies, that it may not have life and power to bring forth the works of the deeds of the
[00:02:53.160 --> 00:02:58.160]   flesh, is a constant duty of believers."
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:04.480]   Our tendency in our generation is the idea of duty is somehow something of the past,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:08.140]   that is an Old Testament command, that is of the Old Covenant.
[00:03:08.140 --> 00:03:09.920]   We don't have any duties.
[00:03:09.920 --> 00:03:13.320]   New Testament is just to receive and then just kind of coast along.
[00:03:13.320 --> 00:03:15.000]   But that is absolutely not the case.
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:19.240]   And hopefully we will look at the text and confirm that.
[00:03:19.240 --> 00:03:21.400]   And he says, "It is a constant duty of believers."
[00:03:21.400 --> 00:03:25.080]   Second quote, "Do you mortify, do you make it your daily work?
[00:03:25.080 --> 00:03:28.160]   Be always at it while you live.
[00:03:28.160 --> 00:03:29.960]   Cease not as a day from this work.
[00:03:29.960 --> 00:03:33.760]   Be killing sin or it will be killing you."
[00:03:33.760 --> 00:03:38.520]   The seriousness of combating sin and fighting against sin.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:44.440]   Third and finally, "Longing, breathing, and panting after deliverance is a grace in itself
[00:03:44.440 --> 00:03:49.160]   that has a mighty power to conform the soul into the likeness of the thing longed for.
[00:03:49.160 --> 00:03:53.400]   Unless you long for deliverance, you shall not have it."
[00:03:53.400 --> 00:03:57.520]   Are we longing to be delivered from these sins?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:01.320]   Have we identified what sins that we are trying to mortify?
[00:04:01.320 --> 00:04:04.720]   What are we wrestling with in the context of sanctification?
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:09.840]   Or have we just kind of swept it under the rug and accepted it as normal?
[00:04:09.840 --> 00:04:13.760]   Paul has been arguing against this idea of passiveness.
[00:04:13.760 --> 00:04:17.720]   That if you accept justification by faith alone and it's not by works,
[00:04:17.720 --> 00:04:20.840]   doesn't it lead to licentious living?
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:24.840]   If you receive a partial gospel, that's exactly what happens.
[00:04:24.840 --> 00:04:28.680]   If you pick and choose certain parts of the gospel and ignore other parts of the gospel,
[00:04:28.680 --> 00:04:30.440]   that's exactly what happens.
[00:04:30.440 --> 00:04:34.680]   Since Jesus Christ died for me and I'm no longer guilty of my sins,
[00:04:34.680 --> 00:04:36.920]   all I need to do is just accept that.
[00:04:36.920 --> 00:04:41.320]   And the only thing that affects it is like, "Well, what kind of mansion am I going to live in heaven?
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:44.800]   So maybe I'll just live in a little shack versus a big mansion."
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:51.080]   So people are living no different than a non-Christian and absolutely convinced.
[00:04:51.080 --> 00:04:53.360]   And they will take certain verses out of context.
[00:04:53.360 --> 00:04:56.200]   "Oh, there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:04:56.200 --> 00:05:03.040]   So therefore, there is no condemnation because I went and raised my hand and accept Jesus Christ."
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.400]   Paul has been arguing against that.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:09.080]   He says, "No, it does not lead to licentiousness by no means."
[00:05:09.080 --> 00:05:11.760]   Does it lead to licentiousness?
[00:05:11.760 --> 00:05:17.200]   So what I want to go over today is kind of bring it all together,
[00:05:17.200 --> 00:05:19.240]   that the arguments that he's been making.
[00:05:19.240 --> 00:05:24.520]   So the first three points that we want to make is really a review of what Paul has been saying.
[00:05:24.520 --> 00:05:26.960]   And then the last two points that we want to make.
[00:05:26.960 --> 00:05:33.240]   There's five things that he has been saying and other things that he will say about mortifying sin.
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:35.080]   How do we conquer sin?
[00:05:35.080 --> 00:05:37.920]   What is it that Paul has identified up to this point,
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:43.440]   and then the paths that we're going to be looking at, how to fight this sin?
[00:05:43.440 --> 00:05:47.840]   I know that in this room, some of you are in that very context right now,
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.200]   that in the context of your struggle,
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:54.040]   that you've been defeated for so many times that you've just kind of accepted.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.920]   That's just the way it is.
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.920]   Maybe this is not meant to be ever conquered.
[00:05:59.920 --> 00:06:05.560]   That God just accepts the fact that we're struggling, we feel guilty and we repent, and that is enough.
[00:06:05.560 --> 00:06:10.560]   That actually living righteousness is really not something that we should expect.
[00:06:10.560 --> 00:06:11.840]   That is absolutely not the case.
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:16.160]   That's what Paul has been arguing against, that that is not the call of God.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:19.840]   But if that's not the case, then what's the answer?
[00:06:19.840 --> 00:06:22.600]   How do we do this? What does the Scripture tell us about it?
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.840]   So there's five things that he's identified.
[00:06:24.840 --> 00:06:29.600]   So this morning, I want to go through these five things, and again, some of it is a review,
[00:06:29.600 --> 00:06:33.680]   and then a couple of points at the end is going to be related to what he's talking about.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.120]   So the first thing that he says is that we need to identify sin as sin.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:42.640]   We need to know sin as sin. That's the first one.
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:48.040]   James 1.23, James describes the law of God as a mirror.
[00:06:48.040 --> 00:06:53.920]   And the only reason why we come before a mirror is to see what we look like.
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:56.760]   Do we have the clothes on right? Is my necktie on correctly?
[00:06:56.760 --> 00:06:59.320]   Did I brush my teeth? Is my toothpaste on my nose?
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:05.480]   You look at that, and James says, a man who comes before the Word of God and just walks away
[00:07:05.480 --> 00:07:10.360]   is like a man who sees himself in a mirror, and then he forgets what he looks like.
[00:07:10.360 --> 00:07:17.680]   So in other words, he says the purpose of the law of God was to reveal and identify the sin in us.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:25.000]   Jeremiah 23.29 describes the law of God as fire and as hammer.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:30.280]   Typically, obviously, in our generation, we don't, I don't know of anybody who knows somebody
[00:07:30.280 --> 00:07:33.000]   who's a blacksmith, at least not in our generation.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.640]   But at that particular time, when you said fire and hammer,
[00:07:35.640 --> 00:07:38.600]   immediately you would have thought of a blacksmith,
[00:07:38.600 --> 00:07:43.800]   because fire would make whatever it is that they're molding malleable,
[00:07:43.800 --> 00:07:46.280]   whether it's steel or whatever it is, and it becomes soft.
[00:07:46.280 --> 00:07:51.240]   And then once it becomes soft, you take the hammer and mold it into what you want it to be.
[00:07:51.240 --> 00:07:57.320]   So when the Word of God is described as fire and hammer,
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:04.680]   it's describing how it causes us to be broken down in order for us to be built up.
[00:08:04.680 --> 00:08:09.360]   So Paul has been arguing this point in chapter 6, chapter 7,
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:15.480]   that the law of God was given in order to reveal sin, to identify sin,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:20.840]   in order to stir up sin, kind of like you wouldn't really know
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:24.600]   if you had a bad temper until you are provoked.
[00:08:24.600 --> 00:08:26.760]   It's like, "Oh, no, I'm the most patient person in the world."
[00:08:26.760 --> 00:08:29.080]   Until somebody cuts you off, and he's like, "You want to die?"
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:30.880]   It's like, "Oh, shoot." Right?
[00:08:30.880 --> 00:08:36.360]   So the law of God came to stir up sin, to reveal what is already in our hearts.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.840]   And then finally, I believe what we talked about in chapter 7,
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:43.760]   that it came to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:47.760]   So the point of the law was to bring us to repentance,
[00:08:47.760 --> 00:08:53.200]   that we would see sin as sin, to see sin being stirred up,
[00:08:53.200 --> 00:08:58.480]   and ultimately bring us to the point where Paul says, "Woe is me.
[00:08:58.480 --> 00:09:02.400]   Who will deliver me from this body of death?"
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:08.560]   So the first thing that we need to recognize is, do we see sin as sin?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.960]   Not simply a mistake, not simply an error, not simply substandard,
[00:09:12.960 --> 00:09:17.200]   but do we see sin as utterly sinful?
[00:09:17.200 --> 00:09:23.480]   That pride that resides in us, have we just justified that?
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   "Well, I mean, look at all these people who wouldn't be proud.
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:28.200]   Look at the gifts that I have."
[00:09:28.200 --> 00:09:32.640]   This coveting in our hearts, have we just kind of swept that under the rug
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:33.880]   and said, "Well, I mean, who doesn't?
[00:09:33.880 --> 00:09:36.920]   I mean, we live in Orange County. We have so much temptation."
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:40.480]   Worldliness, the things that we're pursuing,
[00:09:40.480 --> 00:09:43.800]   have we identified these things as the Bible identified it,
[00:09:43.800 --> 00:09:47.120]   as things that are against God?
[00:09:47.120 --> 00:09:50.960]   Or have we just become so accustomed to living in sin,
[00:09:50.960 --> 00:09:54.080]   living contrary to what the Word of God tells us?
[00:09:54.080 --> 00:09:58.520]   Selfishness, self-centeredness, lukewarmness,
[00:09:58.520 --> 00:10:01.240]   the lust that is in our hearts.
[00:10:01.240 --> 00:10:04.560]   Do we see sin as utterly sinful?
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.720]   Because the point of the law was to cause us to see
[00:10:08.720 --> 00:10:15.480]   the utter depravity of our sins in order to bring us to repentance.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:17.760]   The whole point of repentance, remember the word metanoia,
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:20.840]   is cause us to change our mind.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:27.200]   You can live your life as a great leader and be absolutely wrong with God.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:32.000]   You can actually even bear fruit, have no relationship with God.
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:39.960]   See, the beginning point of a Christian life is not loneliness.
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:43.120]   It is not lack of purpose.
[00:10:43.120 --> 00:10:45.880]   That's not the beginning point of salvation.
[00:10:45.880 --> 00:10:50.200]   You know, I should just be a better person.
[00:10:50.200 --> 00:10:52.160]   I just don't have direction.
[00:10:52.160 --> 00:10:53.480]   What is the reason for existence?
[00:10:53.480 --> 00:10:55.680]   That is not the beginning point of salvation.
[00:10:55.680 --> 00:11:01.560]   Beginning of salvation is to bring us to a point where you say, "Woe is me.
[00:11:01.560 --> 00:11:03.480]   Who will deliver me from this body of sin?"
[00:11:03.480 --> 00:11:07.000]   When we recognize sin as sin.
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   In fact, Paul has been arguing that if a man has not repented,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:18.040]   he can't even know and discern what is right or wrong.
[00:11:18.040 --> 00:11:22.720]   That it is impossible, he says in chapter 7, to even please God.
[00:11:22.720 --> 00:11:24.840]   He's not capable of pleasing God,
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:28.040]   because he can't discern what is right or wrong.
[00:11:28.040 --> 00:11:30.800]   Oftentimes I have conversations with people who ask me,
[00:11:30.800 --> 00:11:32.800]   "Is this sin or is this not sin?"
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.920]   And we get into this discussion of the gray area.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:40.880]   And when I say gray area, and I'm not going to mention any of it,
[00:11:40.880 --> 00:11:42.760]   but I think you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:47.400]   There are a lot of things that we engage in are gray areas.
[00:11:47.400 --> 00:11:51.800]   Gray area basically means it is not clearly wrong and it is not clearly right.
[00:11:51.800 --> 00:11:53.720]   That's what a gray area is.
[00:11:53.720 --> 00:11:58.360]   So these are discussions that we need to have.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:03.280]   We need to be able to identify whether these are things that we should or should not be doing.
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.040]   But oftentimes these questions come in the context of trying to figure out,
[00:12:08.040 --> 00:12:13.280]   "How much can I love this world and still say I love God?
[00:12:13.280 --> 00:12:19.240]   How much can I get away with without saying I've crossed the line?"
[00:12:19.240 --> 00:12:24.000]   Through the years, I've realized it's very unfruitful conversations that I'm having with people,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:28.080]   if that's the intent of the conversation.
[00:12:28.080 --> 00:12:33.200]   Until we identify sin as sin and it's hideous.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:41.960]   If you have done, and there's a possibility that you might have stepped on it,
[00:12:41.960 --> 00:12:48.040]   you're not exactly sure if you did, and you might have or you might not have,
[00:12:48.040 --> 00:12:51.720]   you're not going to take the chance to bring that into your house.
[00:12:51.720 --> 00:12:54.840]   Am I correct? Maybe I'm wrong.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.200]   Maybe some of you are saying, "You don't know me." Maybe I don't know you.
[00:12:59.200 --> 00:13:04.040]   If there's a possibility that you stepped on dung, you're going to burn that shoe.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:08.440]   You're going to wash it. You're going to make sure that that's not being drug into your house,
[00:13:08.440 --> 00:13:12.720]   just in case there's some on your shoes.
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:17.080]   So the context of trying to figure out whether that is acceptable or unacceptable
[00:13:17.080 --> 00:13:20.160]   has to be in the context of seeing sin as sin.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:26.600]   If you don't see sin as dung, and you're just trying to figure out how much can I get away with,
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:31.040]   then it's kind of like, "Well, I got dung in my... Maybe I have dung in my house.
[00:13:31.040 --> 00:13:35.520]   Since I'm not sure, I'm going to drag it into the house."
[00:13:35.520 --> 00:13:42.160]   It's an unfruitful conversation because a person who doesn't know sin as sin
[00:13:42.160 --> 00:13:51.360]   will not understand why we would take such anal measures to make sure that we're not anywhere near it.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:55.880]   So first thing he says, to identify sin as sin, that it is utterly sinful.
[00:13:55.880 --> 00:13:58.400]   We're disgusted by it.
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:03.160]   Secondly, to understand what is the consequence of this sin.
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:07.720]   If sin is utterly sinful, what is the consequence of this sin?
[00:14:07.720 --> 00:14:12.040]   Paul identifies sin and its consequence, and he goes straight.
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:13.720]   There's no beating around the bush.
[00:14:13.720 --> 00:14:17.240]   He says the consequence of sin is death.
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:20.480]   It is not simply broken relationships.
[00:14:20.480 --> 00:14:22.960]   It is not lack of direction.
[00:14:22.960 --> 00:14:27.680]   It is not lack of unity or lack of church growth or frustration.
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:34.240]   All of these things are true, but at the end of the day, the result of sin, he says, is death.
[00:14:34.240 --> 00:14:41.320]   And he's been pounding this over and over again, all the way up to chapter 7, Romans 5.12.
[00:14:41.320 --> 00:14:45.560]   "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, death through sin."
[00:14:45.560 --> 00:14:50.080]   Sin didn't just come in and then says, "Ah, they just messed up everything. Everybody's so selfish."
[00:14:50.080 --> 00:14:52.680]   He said, "No, death came in because of sin."
[00:14:52.680 --> 00:14:56.240]   Romans 6.16, "Sin ultimately leads to death."
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:59.760]   Romans 6.23, "For the wages of sin is death."
[00:14:59.760 --> 00:15:04.120]   Romans 7.13, "It was sin producing death in me."
[00:15:04.120 --> 00:15:10.720]   Romans 8.6, "To set the mind on the flesh is death."
[00:15:10.720 --> 00:15:14.560]   Over and over again, Paul has been trying to convey this message.
[00:15:14.560 --> 00:15:17.240]   Sin is not simply a mistake.
[00:15:17.240 --> 00:15:21.160]   The consequence of sin is not simply frustration.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:24.160]   It's not simply broken relationship or even bad marriage.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:29.120]   All of these things are true, but he says, "Sin equals death."
[00:15:29.120 --> 00:15:34.400]   And he wanted to convey over and over again, not only is it utterly sinful,
[00:15:34.400 --> 00:15:40.960]   not only is sin utterly sinful, it is utterly sinful because of the consequence of this sin.
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:47.640]   In Romans 8.1, he says, "There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.520]   Now, if he says that, and then the rest of chapter 8, he doesn't bring up sin anymore.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:54.680]   He just says, "Well, I mean, you live the way you live,
[00:15:54.680 --> 00:15:58.720]   but thank God there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus."
[00:15:58.720 --> 00:16:04.240]   That we're so eager to jump to no condemnation
[00:16:04.240 --> 00:16:09.560]   that we forget that God has challenged and called us to a life of repentance.
[00:16:09.560 --> 00:16:16.560]   He says in verse 13, "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die."
[00:16:16.560 --> 00:16:21.080]   This is after he said there's no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:16:21.080 --> 00:16:25.040]   So we may read that superficially and say, "Well, is Jesus saying then
[00:16:25.040 --> 00:16:30.640]   that if we don't live righteously, you have to somehow earn your righteousness to get into heaven?
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:33.600]   Is Jesus or is Paul changing his mind?"
[00:16:33.600 --> 00:16:35.920]   Of course not.
[00:16:35.920 --> 00:16:38.200]   God is not contradicting himself.
[00:16:38.200 --> 00:16:42.000]   He says what he's saying because the greatest evidence
[00:16:42.000 --> 00:16:46.600]   of the life of the Holy Spirit is changed life.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:53.680]   If you continue to live in sin, it may be evidence that there is no Holy Spirit in you.
[00:16:53.680 --> 00:17:00.560]   The greatest evidence of a changed life or a salvation and repentance is a changed life.
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:05.400]   That's why he says, "If you live according to the flesh, again, you will die."
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:10.920]   He didn't just deliver us from the consequence of sin, but also the power of sin.
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:15.240]   And let me illustrate what Paul is trying to say.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:22.720]   I had a friend whose younger brother started to get hooked on crack a long time ago.
[00:17:22.720 --> 00:17:25.040]   So it was by the time I was a freshman or sophomore in college
[00:17:25.040 --> 00:17:27.760]   and his brother was junior or senior in high school.
[00:17:27.760 --> 00:17:31.320]   And this is when crack cocaine just started coming in.
[00:17:31.320 --> 00:17:35.400]   And so his younger brother, he wasn't a Christian, he attended church every once in a while,
[00:17:35.400 --> 00:17:37.200]   but he started doing crack.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.880]   And so initially, we didn't take it that seriously because we knew a lot of people who did drugs at that time,
[00:17:40.880 --> 00:17:43.200]   going to parties and getting drunk and all that.
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:45.960]   But his brother just kind of got carried away.
[00:17:45.960 --> 00:17:51.840]   And every month, every time I would go to his house, his brother would be more and more disconnected.
[00:17:51.840 --> 00:17:55.560]   And there were some days I would come to the house and he would be sitting out in the living room,
[00:17:55.560 --> 00:17:57.360]   just staring out into space.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:17:59.520]   We would try to engage him, "Hey, David, what's going on?"
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:01.520]   And he wouldn't be able to hear what I'm saying.
[00:18:01.520 --> 00:18:03.080]   He just kind of engaged out.
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:08.320]   And so his whole family was concerned, but his family was going through all kinds of trouble at that time,
[00:18:08.320 --> 00:18:12.120]   and they really didn't pay much attention to him.
[00:18:12.120 --> 00:18:17.040]   Well, six, seven, eight months passed by, and I asked my friend Charles,
[00:18:17.040 --> 00:18:19.840]   I said, "Hey, Charles, what's going on with your brother David?"
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:24.840]   And he said, "My brother got so deep into, so hooked on drugs,
[00:18:24.840 --> 00:18:29.280]   "eventually it fried his brain, that he got brain damage."
[00:18:29.280 --> 00:18:32.120]   So I, again, went and talked to Charles and he said,
[00:18:32.120 --> 00:18:36.520]   "Well, he's not completely not there, but something's off about him."
[00:18:36.520 --> 00:18:39.920]   And ever since then, again, when you try to have a conversation,
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:45.840]   you can't hold a normal conversation with him because he got so deeply involved with drugs.
[00:18:45.840 --> 00:18:50.720]   Now we can look at that and say, "Well, but thank God he never got arrested."
[00:18:50.720 --> 00:18:55.520]   He never got arrested because he never paid the penalty of doing drugs.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:59.680]   See, to say that we've been delivered from the penalty of sin,
[00:18:59.680 --> 00:19:03.440]   and not the power of sin, is no different than saying, "You know what?
[00:19:03.440 --> 00:19:06.000]   "Just let's make it legal.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:10.760]   "Let's make doing drugs legal, so there's no penalty for drugs."
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:14.280]   But the consequence of doing drugs is still the same.
[00:19:14.280 --> 00:19:19.400]   There's a reason why the government passed a law forbidding drugs.
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:24.480]   Because of what it causes, because of the danger of it, and what it leads to.
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:29.800]   To simply say, "Well, thank God that the penalty of sin is no longer on me,"
[00:19:29.800 --> 00:19:37.640]   while the consequence of this sin is still reaping havoc in our lives.
[00:19:37.640 --> 00:19:40.960]   That is not what the Gospel is.
[00:19:40.960 --> 00:19:44.840]   The Gospel has delivered us not only from the penalty, but the power,
[00:19:44.840 --> 00:19:46.920]   the destructive force of sin.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:53.360]   And that's why he says, "If you continue to live in sin, you will die."
[00:19:53.360 --> 00:19:56.160]   So we need to know what sin is, that it is utterly sinful.
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:19:58.080]   The consequence of the sin.
[00:19:58.080 --> 00:20:01.520]   And that's why we are challenged to battle the sin.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:05.240]   We need to know that we have been given the power to battle the sin.
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:07.400]   That's the third point.
[00:20:07.400 --> 00:20:09.320]   We have been given power to battle the sin.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:14.480]   He didn't simply say, "Hey, you ought to do this," and then left us frustrated.
[00:20:14.480 --> 00:20:16.160]   Which I know a lot of people feel.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:19.760]   Like, "Okay, you know, I've been wrestling and struggling with these things.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:20.760]   I haven't conquered it."
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:25.760]   So you just kind of accepted it in your life, and that you're going to live a certain way.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:28.760]   But that's not what the Scripture says.
[00:20:28.760 --> 00:20:31.760]   Let me read another quote from the book, "The Mortification of Sin."
[00:20:31.760 --> 00:20:35.480]   It says, "Man may easier see without eyes, speak without tongue,
[00:20:35.480 --> 00:20:41.080]   and truly mortify one sin without the Holy Spirit."
[00:20:41.080 --> 00:20:46.360]   Another quote, "Mortification from self-strength, carried on by ways of self-invention,
[00:20:46.360 --> 00:20:54.360]   unto the end of self-righteousness, is the soul and substance of all false religion in the world."
[00:20:54.360 --> 00:21:00.040]   In other words, if you try to conquer this flesh by your own strength,
[00:21:00.040 --> 00:21:02.800]   it will just lead to frustration.
[00:21:02.800 --> 00:21:04.760]   And that's clearly what Paul says.
[00:21:04.760 --> 00:21:08.400]   The difference between chapter 7 and chapter 8 is the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:13.480]   The difference between having the power to live righteously and being stuck in sin
[00:21:13.480 --> 00:21:15.320]   is the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:21.960]   And that's why Paul says in 1 Thessalonians 5, 19, "Do not quench the Spirit."
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:25.960]   The word "quench" basically means to frustrate the Holy Spirit.
[00:21:25.960 --> 00:21:29.360]   If you notice the language that talks about the Holy Spirit,
[00:21:29.360 --> 00:21:32.400]   it's always in the context of the Holy Spirit already at work in you.
[00:21:32.400 --> 00:21:35.640]   He doesn't say the Holy Spirit is hiding under a rock somewhere,
[00:21:35.640 --> 00:21:39.440]   so if you lift enough rocks, you're going to find it.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:44.120]   Or maybe if we sing the right songs, maybe if we yell when we're singing,
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.000]   instead of being quiet, sing certain songs, maybe if we dim the lights,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.880]   maybe if our prayer meeting was more engaging.
[00:21:52.880 --> 00:21:58.360]   All of these things are very superficial.
[00:21:58.360 --> 00:22:04.240]   The language that we see about the work of the Holy Spirit is it is already working in us.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:07.080]   So when he says, "Do not quench the Holy Spirit,"
[00:22:07.080 --> 00:22:13.880]   it means to resist the Holy Spirit, to frustrate the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:13.880 --> 00:22:15.440]   How do we frustrate the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:18.240]   Well, Colossians 3, 1-4.
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:21.360]   If you remember, the primary work of the Holy Spirit,
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.000]   Jesus says in John 14, 15, and 16,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.640]   he says, "The Helper is going to come, whose primary work is to help you,
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:34.200]   that Spirit of truth, he's going to come and remind you of everything that I have said,
[00:22:34.200 --> 00:22:37.240]   everything that I have said, he's going to remind you of that.
[00:22:37.240 --> 00:22:41.480]   And then he says he's going to convict the world of sin and righteousness."
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:45.480]   So we talked about the work of the Holy Spirit primarily is to bring us
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.680]   to a dynamic relationship with Jesus Christ by reminding us of what he has done and who he is.
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:55.360]   So there's only one mediator between us and God, which is Jesus Christ.
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:59.840]   But there's also a mediator between us and Christ, which is the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:59.840 --> 00:23:04.640]   So the Holy Spirit is to come and bring us to repentance, remember?
[00:23:04.640 --> 00:23:09.400]   Repentance is to change our mind, to renew our mind, renew our thinking.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:11.880]   So Colossians 3, 1-4.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:15.040]   "If then you have been raised with Christ, seek the things that are above,
[00:23:15.040 --> 00:23:17.280]   where Christ is seated at the right hand of God.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:20.160]   Set your minds on the things that are above,
[00:23:20.160 --> 00:23:24.440]   not on the things that are on earth, for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:23:24.440 --> 00:23:30.080]   When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you will also appear with him in glory."
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.880]   How do we quench the Holy Spirit?
[00:23:32.880 --> 00:23:35.520]   How do we frustrate the Holy Spirit?
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:40.960]   If our mind is constantly engaged in a thing that has nothing to do with God.
[00:23:40.960 --> 00:23:44.840]   Now there are things that are clearly identified as sin.
[00:23:44.840 --> 00:23:50.400]   You're watching pornography, lying, cheating, all of these things are clearly identified as sin.
[00:23:50.400 --> 00:23:55.880]   And all of these things frustrate the power of the Holy Spirit that is already working in us.
[00:23:55.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   But I think the primary thing that we wrestle with
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:06.880]   is constantly being engaged in our mind of things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:24:06.880 --> 00:24:13.080]   That's what quenches the Holy Spirit more than anything else in an average person.
[00:24:13.080 --> 00:24:17.160]   Is constantly engaged in things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:24:17.160 --> 00:24:22.040]   Now I can start naming what they are, and we're all guilty to a certain level.
[00:24:22.040 --> 00:24:28.320]   But if the Holy Spirit's work is to constantly cause us to remember the things of Christ,
[00:24:28.320 --> 00:24:34.800]   then quenching the Holy Spirit means to frustrate that process.
[00:24:34.800 --> 00:24:40.080]   To engage our hearts and our mind in seeking after things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:42.560]   It may not be sinful.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:46.280]   No one could cause you, if anybody points any of that to you,
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:50.760]   your first response is, "Oh, legalism. Danger of legalism."
[00:24:50.760 --> 00:24:54.080]   So we're so afraid to challenge people of these things
[00:24:54.080 --> 00:24:59.960]   because of this all-encompassing word, legalism.
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:05.160]   But the primary way that we frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:11.600]   is to constantly seeking and engaging our minds with the things that have nothing to do with God.
[00:25:11.600 --> 00:25:15.040]   The second thing that we're taught about the Holy Spirit, Ephesians 4.30,
[00:25:15.040 --> 00:25:21.520]   it says, "Do not grieve the Holy Spirit by whom you are sealed for the day of redemption."
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:23.440]   So let me ask you.
[00:25:23.440 --> 00:25:27.720]   It says, "Do not quench, do not stop or frustrate the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:25:27.720 --> 00:25:31.640]   by constantly seeking after things that have nothing to do with God."
[00:25:31.640 --> 00:25:33.760]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.440]   Can you grieve furniture?
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:38.680]   Of course not.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:40.440]   Can you grieve this table?
[00:25:40.440 --> 00:25:41.720]   Can you grieve the weather?
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:42.840]   No.
[00:25:42.840 --> 00:25:46.880]   You only grieve something that's a being, that has emotions.
[00:25:46.880 --> 00:25:52.000]   The word "grieve" basically means a cause to mourn or to sadden.
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:54.320]   The reason why it tells us not to grieve the Holy Spirit
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:58.720]   is because the Holy Spirit is a being, not an "it."
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.760]   It is not some Mother Nature, it's not some independent power.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:04.480]   It is a being.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.320]   That's why we say He's a third person of the Holy Spirit.
[00:26:09.320 --> 00:26:14.160]   We have a tendency to look at God as an "it."
[00:26:14.160 --> 00:26:16.400]   I know we call Him Father, I know we worship Him,
[00:26:16.400 --> 00:26:18.480]   and I always say we adore Him, all this stuff.
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:23.360]   But emotionally, we treat Him like an "it."
[00:26:23.360 --> 00:26:28.920]   If we treat our friends anywhere near the way that we treat our God,
[00:26:28.920 --> 00:26:32.480]   you would have no friends.
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:35.400]   Let me illustrate what I mean by that.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:38.440]   If you make an appointment with God,
[00:26:38.440 --> 00:26:41.120]   and you say, "Let's meet at 7 o'clock."
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:45.600]   And you say to Him, "OK, let's make it 7.
[00:26:45.600 --> 00:26:49.440]   But just in case something, I don't want to commit to that yet.
[00:26:49.440 --> 00:26:53.240]   Just in case there's a Boba sale going on,
[00:26:53.240 --> 00:26:56.680]   and they happen to be at 7 o'clock, I don't want to commit yet,
[00:26:56.680 --> 00:26:57.800]   but just in case.
[00:26:57.800 --> 00:26:59.760]   Just in case a friend comes from out of town,
[00:26:59.760 --> 00:27:01.800]   and I don't want to commit to it yet.
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.880]   So what I'll do is that at 6.59, I'll let you know."
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.840]   6.59.
[00:27:07.840 --> 00:27:10.640]   What if every time you make a commitment,
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.400]   commitment, appointment with God, and that's what you say to Him,
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:15.080]   eventually you wouldn't have any relationship?
[00:27:15.080 --> 00:27:17.920]   Imagine if you did that with any of your friends.
[00:27:17.920 --> 00:27:19.280]   Like, "Yes, yes, let's meet together.
[00:27:19.280 --> 00:27:21.440]   We haven't seen each other. Let's connect.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:23.560]   Let's make it Tuesday at 8.
[00:27:23.560 --> 00:27:26.360]   But let's just keep it tentative.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:28.040]   Keep it tentative, just in case.
[00:27:28.040 --> 00:27:30.440]   Just in case I had a burrito the night before,
[00:27:30.440 --> 00:27:33.760]   and it wasn't fully digested, and I need to sleep a little bit longer.
[00:27:33.760 --> 00:27:38.080]   Just in case there was some good program that kind of ran late.
[00:27:38.080 --> 00:27:40.240]   You know what I mean? And I hung out a little bit.
[00:27:40.240 --> 00:27:42.800]   Just in case. I'm going to be there.
[00:27:42.800 --> 00:27:45.560]   But just in case something happens."
[00:27:45.560 --> 00:27:46.920]   Imagine if we did that,
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.040]   what kind of relationship that we have with any friend.
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.720]   Not only would you not have friends, you would have negative friends.
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:55.640]   You have other friends who will hear about your flakiness,
[00:27:55.640 --> 00:28:00.360]   and they will never want to be friends with you.
[00:28:00.360 --> 00:28:03.520]   I remember when this really hit me as a college student,
[00:28:03.520 --> 00:28:06.160]   because I would make appointments with friends.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:09.120]   "Hey, let's meet together at the prayer chapel at 6 in the morning,
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:12.000]   and then we'll pray and do quiet time together."
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:14.720]   And I remember thinking at that time,
[00:28:14.720 --> 00:28:17.720]   "I wonder how God feels
[00:28:17.720 --> 00:28:20.680]   when we make this commitment we don't follow through."
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:23.240]   If He's a being, because I know how I would feel
[00:28:23.240 --> 00:28:25.960]   if my friends treated me that way.
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:29.160]   And I remember thinking, "Wow, you know, I say,
[00:28:29.160 --> 00:28:32.400]   'I'm going to meet with the Lord at this time, and I'm going to pray,'
[00:28:32.400 --> 00:28:34.920]   but it's always just the last priority.
[00:28:34.920 --> 00:28:37.440]   It's always number one on paper,
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.400]   but it's always last in priority."
[00:28:40.400 --> 00:28:42.440]   The reason why it says not to grieve the Holy Spirit
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.960]   is because He has emotions, not to sadden or to cause Him to mourn.
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:50.600]   Because the work of the Holy Spirit is to bring us to Christ,
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:56.160]   and we're constantly just kind of like putting Him on the side.
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:28:59.680]   Do not quench the Holy Spirit.
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:01.680]   Do not grieve the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:01.680 --> 00:29:04.040]   Do not sadden Him
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.840]   by the way that we just kind of put Him aside.
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.920]   You know what? We spend all our time
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.520]   thinking about everything that has nothing to do with Him,
[00:29:11.520 --> 00:29:14.720]   and then just like ready, you know?
[00:29:14.720 --> 00:29:16.320]   And then when He doesn't answer our prayer,
[00:29:16.320 --> 00:29:20.480]   all of a sudden, like, our God is even real?
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.080]   And think about all the other time we just completely ignore Him,
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.320]   and that one time we prayed and God seemingly didn't answer
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.320]   at the time that we wanted Him to answer Him.
[00:29:29.320 --> 00:29:32.560]   He's like, "What? This is a loving God?"
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:35.080]   Imagine if we did that with any of our friends.
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.520]   What kind of relationship would we have?
[00:29:38.520 --> 00:29:41.160]   Rather than quenching the Spirit and grieving the Holy Spirit,
[00:29:41.160 --> 00:29:43.760]   it says in Ephesians 5, 17,
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:46.480]   "Do not be foolish, but understand what the will of the Lord is,
[00:29:46.480 --> 00:29:49.600]   and do not get drunk with wine, for that is debauchery,
[00:29:49.600 --> 00:29:52.280]   but be filled with the Holy Spirit."
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.480]   Be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:54.480 --> 00:29:58.960]   To be filled with the Holy Spirit basically means to be consumed,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:04.360]   not to dabble in it, not to spend your extra time on it.
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.320]   Make it our consumption, absolutely consumed.
[00:30:08.320 --> 00:30:10.480]   It is a strange thing in our culture
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:12.360]   that when somebody is on fire for God,
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:15.320]   what's the first thing that we say?
[00:30:15.320 --> 00:30:18.360]   "Are you going to be a pastor?
[00:30:18.360 --> 00:30:20.480]   Are you going to go to missions?
[00:30:20.480 --> 00:30:23.120]   You should be a seminary teacher."
[00:30:23.120 --> 00:30:26.840]   Because as soon as somebody is passionately consumed
[00:30:26.840 --> 00:30:31.880]   with the things of God, you can't be one of us.
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:37.360]   You should join that group, the on-fire group.
[00:30:37.360 --> 00:30:40.920]   This command is for all Christians.
[00:30:40.920 --> 00:30:44.120]   All Christians are called and commanded
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.560]   to be filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:52.320]   to be consumed, not just dabble in it on Sunday,
[00:30:52.320 --> 00:30:57.640]   not just study it on Wednesday, but to be consumed.
[00:30:57.640 --> 00:31:00.840]   Because the only way that we can conquer sin
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.360]   is when we are controlled by the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:03.360 --> 00:31:05.440]   consumed by the Holy Spirit, not just dabble in it,
[00:31:05.440 --> 00:31:08.600]   not just take a taste of it, but feast.
[00:31:08.600 --> 00:31:12.760]   That's what that means, to be consumed in the Holy Spirit,
[00:31:12.760 --> 00:31:16.600]   not just like, "Oh, I did my quiet time in the morning."
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:19.720]   The whole purpose of why we are challenged to do quiet time
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:23.120]   is because I have a tendency to forget.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.400]   The only way that I can consume my mind and heart
[00:31:25.400 --> 00:31:28.120]   with the things of God is to come early in the morning
[00:31:28.120 --> 00:31:30.320]   to be reminded of the things of God.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.520]   So not simply to say, "I did it in the morning,"
[00:31:32.520 --> 00:31:36.440]   so that I can all day long think and meditate
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:38.320]   on the things of God.
[00:31:38.320 --> 00:31:41.560]   Why it's not just Sunday, but Monday through Sunday,
[00:31:41.560 --> 00:31:44.520]   so that I can be consumed with the things of God,
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:46.400]   day in and day out.
[00:31:46.440 --> 00:31:50.200]   Because only then can I know the power of God.
[00:31:50.200 --> 00:31:56.560]   Fourthly, know that God commands us to do this.
[00:31:56.560 --> 00:31:57.400]   He commands us.
[00:31:57.400 --> 00:31:59.920]   Not only did he give us the power in the Holy Spirit
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:04.080]   to conquer sin, he says he commands us in Romans 8:13,
[00:32:04.080 --> 00:32:06.960]   "For if you live according to the flesh, you will die.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.520]   "But if you live by the Spirit,
[00:32:08.520 --> 00:32:11.960]   "you put to death the deeds of the body, and you will live."
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.120]   Put to death the deeds of the body.
[00:32:16.520 --> 00:32:18.520]   That's a command, that's an imperative.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:23.560]   That you have to actively pursue putting to death sin.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:26.360]   Not passively waiting for something to happen,
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:29.480]   or somebody to come into our lives.
[00:32:29.480 --> 00:32:31.400]   Everything that you need for a life of Godliness
[00:32:31.400 --> 00:32:32.840]   has been given to you.
[00:32:32.840 --> 00:32:36.000]   But sometimes we wait passively thinking
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:38.320]   and hoping that God will do something
[00:32:38.320 --> 00:32:41.400]   that maybe God is waiting for you to do something.
[00:32:41.400 --> 00:32:43.000]   (buzzing)
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:44.920]   Maybe that's why we're frustrated.
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:46.280]   We're sitting here waiting for him,
[00:32:46.280 --> 00:32:48.240]   and God's sitting there waiting for us.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:52.480]   He commands us to kill sin.
[00:32:52.480 --> 00:32:55.320]   Knowing how to put to death sin for it is,
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:56.640]   knowing the consequence,
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:32:59.480]   knowing that he's given us the Holy Spirit,
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:00.640]   knowing temptation has eaged you
[00:33:00.640 --> 00:33:01.720]   to put to death sin for all men,
[00:33:01.720 --> 00:33:04.880]   but with temptation, he will provide a way of escape.
[00:33:04.880 --> 00:33:06.520]   Which is just really, really powerful.
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:09.880]   And now he says, "Put to death sin."
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.560]   Actively put to death sin.
[00:33:12.560 --> 00:33:15.640]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:15.840 --> 00:33:18.920]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:19.200 --> 00:33:22.280]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:25.360]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:25.360 --> 00:33:28.440]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:36.000]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:50.160]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:53.120 --> 00:33:56.120]   (voices overlapping)
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:05.680]   (voices overlapping)
