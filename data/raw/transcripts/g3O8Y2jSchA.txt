[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   All right, as we prepare to get ready to begin our worship,
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   I just wanted to make clear that you understand the reason why we do this on New Year's Eve.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And I know that you guys could have, you know,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   like spend time sleeping or gathering together with your friends and doing the countdown and all that.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   But the part of the reason why we do this is we want, this is more of a dedication service,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   that as we face a new year, you know, we had our last Sunday service this morning,
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   but we wanted to give the very first period, again, obviously it's symbolically, but our own hearts,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   that as we face 2024, and again, as Pastor Mark reminded us this morning,
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   that we would live our lives intentionally, that we would not be just satisfied with,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   well, you know, we're just sinners and we're all just going to fail,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   that we would never settle into that, but that we would be resolved to make sure that we live our lives deliberately.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   And so we want to give the first fruits. And I know some of you guys who brought small children to the church,
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   and I know they're tired, but, you know, when our children were young,
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   the reason why we did it is because even though they may not fully understand what they're doing,
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:59.000]   that they understand, it's like, yeah, I remember we used to go to New Year's Eve services or early rise services,
[00:08:59.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and that they understand how important that our dedicated time is.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   So whether it's New Year's or whether it's Christmas or whether it's whatever services that we have,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   that in their memory, that it would be embedded in them, that my parents really thought that this was important,
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   that dedicating ourselves to New Year's, that this is more important than our sleep.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   This is more important than anything else that we could do, that making God first in our lives.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   And even though sometimes we say it in our hearts, we don't necessarily carry it out in the way that we live.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   And so it's important for us as we face the new year that we want to make sure as we come before God saying like,
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Lord, whether I succeed or whether I may have a hard time, that at least in my heart,
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   I want to dedicate this new year to be deliberate in making you first.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   And so that's why we're having this service as a community together, that we would dedicate it together.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   So let me pray for us. And so the way that this night is going to go is that after I pray,
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   our worship is going to lead us in our first song, and then we're going to take about 10 minutes.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Our media team has created a video to kind of wrap up the year.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:14.000]   And then after that, we're going to have our main praise section, and then I'm going to come up and give a short encouragement.
[00:10:14.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   And then we're going to split up into if you're here with your families to take time to pray with your families,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   or if you have people around you to take some time to pray for each other.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   These are some of the things that we're shooting for in the new year.
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   This is how I want to dedicate 2024.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   And then after that, hopefully we'll be able to finish in time to say Happy New Year together.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   We're going to have a countdown. And then after that, please go home.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   Okay? And then get some sleep. I know a lot of you guys have a big day tomorrow as well.
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll begin our worship.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   Father, we thank you so much for sustaining us through 2023.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And as we face a new year, Lord, you know our hearts, our desires.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   Lord, each year as we make resolutions, and oftentimes so frustrated, Lord God, that we are not able to reach our goals.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Help us, Lord God, to never give up, though.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   Knowing, Father, that you are patient, knowing that you called us, knowing, Father God, that we are fighting the good fight.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:34.000]   Help us not to simply go along with the rest of this world, and not to be given and to be influenced by the tide that is around us.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   Help us to be resolved to live lives truly worthy of the gospel, not only for ourselves, but even for our children,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   that they would understand that dedication to you is more important, Lord God, than anything else that we engage in.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And so we pray that as we spend this time together singing, praising, and praying together,
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   may it be a time, Lord God, that we would truly dedicate our hearts, dedicate our time.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:14.000]   and that you would remind us, Lord God,
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   of the things that you desire and not just our hearts.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   Pastor Mark mentioned this during the service today,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:29.000]   but this week has been unique in many ways,
[00:37:29.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   but one of the things that I will remember about this year
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   is that we've had more funerals in our church
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:39.000]   than we've ever had in our church history.
[00:37:39.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And I know that while we were going through a pandemic,
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   we said, "Well, this was a crazy few years."
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   During the pandemic, we had to shut down,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   and even though we were able to open up pretty quickly,
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   I remember a long time ago,
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   I was sharing with another pastor friend of mine
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   who was serving at another church,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:01.000]   and his congregation, their average age were in their 70s,
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:04.000]   and he would tell me how he's constantly attending,
[00:38:04.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   having to oversee funerals at his church.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   And I was telling him, at our church,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:11.000]   because our church is so young,
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   we would have 10, 20-plus weddings,
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   and so I'm not accustomed to going to a lot of funerals.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   But this year I would say I probably attended more funerals
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   than I did weddings this year for the first time in ministry.
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.000]   And I'm not sure if that's going to be the pattern going forward.
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   I know part of it is because some of you guys are getting older,
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:39.000]   and you have aging parents, and some of them were very sudden.
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:43.000]   Some of the people who passed away were, again, young.
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:46.000]   A lot of them were not just simply of old age.
[00:38:46.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   Something sudden happened.
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   But as a result of that, it forces us to think about our mortality.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   In Ecclesiastes 7, 2-4, it says,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "It is better to go to a house of mourning
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   than to go to a house of feasting,
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.000]   because that is the end of every man,
[00:39:02.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   and the living takes it to heart.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   But sorrow is better than laughter,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:09.000]   for when a face is sad, a heart may be happy.
[00:39:09.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   The mind of the wise is in the house of mourning,
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:15.000]   while the mind of fools is in the house of pleasure."
[00:39:15.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   If you're in the habit of only surrounding yourselves
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:21.000]   with pleasure and happiness,
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:25.000]   and you're not accustomed to being sad or mourning,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   when you begin to have these feelings of mourning and sadness
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   and something serious, you automatically think something is wrong.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   I've got to go see a psychologist.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   They're more than willing to just give you pills to make you feel better
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   so you don't think too deeply about these things.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   The Bible says that it's good for us to mourn.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   There are times when sadness is good for our souls.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   In fact, it tells us that it makes us wise
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   to contemplate sadness, to attend funerals.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   It causes us to think because this is the destiny of every man.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Because of where we live,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   we have a tendency to kind of like funerals and death,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and we kind of put it up in the--
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   We know it's real. We know it happens.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   But as soon as it's over, we want to go right back to our joy,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   to our parties, to our weddings.
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:14.000]   But this is the destiny of every man.
[00:40:14.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   And the more we contemplate it, it says it makes us wise.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   In fact, Psalm 90.12 says,
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   "Teach us to number our days
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   that we may present to you a heart of wisdom."
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   When you mourn, and I know many of you in this room
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   have faced sadness this year.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   Maybe it was heart-wrenching.
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   Maybe it was difficult.
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   But mourning causes us--
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   It says it gives us a heart of wisdom.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Psalm 90 is a psalm that Moses wrote.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   And no one has seen more death in his leadership
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   than probably Moses.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   Because when Moses entered into that desert,
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   he entered with 600,000 fighting men,
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   but if you include the women and children,
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   it was well over a million people.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   And the Scripture tells us that whole generation got wiped out.
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   And by the time they went into the new promised land,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   it was a completely new generation
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   with new leadership that went into the promised land,
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   which means that he oversaw the death
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   of over a million people during those 40 years.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   And so Moses is not just saying something just off the cuff.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   This is something that he's experienced
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   over and over again,
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   hundreds of thousands of deaths that he oversaw.
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:30.000]   And he's concluding in that,
[00:41:30.000 --> 00:41:33.000]   "Teach us, Lord, not only that they died,"
[00:41:33.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   and he doesn't say, "So that we don't die."
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   He says, "We know where they went, we're all going.
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   "Help us not to simply be afraid
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   "that what happened to them won't happen to us."
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   But in fact, he says, "Help us to meditate on that.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   "Help us to number our days,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   "to recognize that where they went is where we're going,
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:58.000]   "so that we may live wisely."
[00:41:58.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   This morning, this afternoon, I wanted to talk about,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   like, what gives us wisdom?
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   What is it about the meditation of death,
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:07.000]   or knowing the shortness of our life,
[00:42:07.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   that causes us to have heart of wisdom, right?
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:17.000]   Death, number one, reminds us how fragile our life is, right?
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   When all you do is fill your life with laughter,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   you think that this is going to be forever.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   You think that that's the normal, that's what's normal.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:29.000]   He says, Psalm 95 through 6,
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   "You have swept them away like a flood, they fall asleep."
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   He gives three examples of how fleeting life is.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Like a flood that comes, and all of a sudden, it's gone.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   It's like you just, all of a sudden, fall asleep.
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   And then he says, "In the morning, they are like grass,
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   "which sprouts anew.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   "In the morning, it flourishes and sprouts anew.
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:50.000]   "Toward evening, it fades and withers away."
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:53.000]   Just like the morning dew comes,
[00:42:53.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   and then next thing you know, it's completely gone.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   He says that's what our life is like.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   It's like a flood, it's like our sleep, it's like a dew.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   Help us to know that this is how fleeting our life is,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   how fragile it is.
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   Psalm 39, 4 through 5, "Lord, make me know my end,
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   "and what is the extent of my days.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:15.000]   "Let me know how transient I am.
[00:43:15.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   "Behold, you have made my days as high-end breath,
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   "and my lifetime as nothing in your sight.
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   "Surely, every man at his best is a mere breath."
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   One of the advantages of getting older
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:32.000]   is that you have lived more, you know, much more
[00:43:32.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   than you know that's ahead of you, right?
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   So if you're in your 20s, right,
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   you think you have a whole life ahead of you.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:42.000]   You're going to find somebody, you're going to get married,
[00:43:42.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   you're going to have children,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   so you have a long life ahead of you.
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   So you think.
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:50.000]   You ask anybody who's lived, you know, in their 50s or 60s,
[00:43:50.000 --> 00:43:53.000]   and I've mentioned this so many times.
[00:43:53.000 --> 00:43:57.000]   My 25th birthday seems like yesterday,
[00:43:57.000 --> 00:44:00.000]   and I'm not--I know everybody, you know, gets older,
[00:44:00.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   says the same thing, but it really went by that fast.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   I remember the 40s went by so fast, right?
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   I can't believe I just turned 40, and then now I'm 50.
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   So in the 50s, I stopped even counting, right?
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   It goes by so fast.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   Next thing you know, you're in your 60s,
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   and then you see your parents pass away.
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:21.000]   And mortality is real.
[00:44:21.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   No matter how hard we work to try to hold on to life
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   just a little bit longer,
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   you can go to the gym and stay as healthy as you can,
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   and you can extend your life another 5, maybe 10-plus years,
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   but at the end of the day, no matter how healthy you are,
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   it says possibly 70, possibly 80.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:39.000]   It says Psalm 90.10.
[00:44:39.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   That's where the days of our life contain 70 years,
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   or if due to strength, 80 years.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Yet their pride is but labor and sorrow,
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   for soon it is gone and we fly away.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   Why is it important for us to understand
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:02.000]   and to meditate on how fleeting this life is?
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:05.000]   Because the decisions that we make oftentimes
[00:45:05.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   are very short-sighted, right?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   Things that we value.
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I don't know about you, but when I was younger,
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   we used to play marbles, and either we play marbles
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   or we used to play, like in Korean it's horchak,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:26.000]   you know, like even and odd, right?
[00:45:26.000 --> 00:45:29.000]   And then we would play, and then the kids who are good
[00:45:29.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   would be able to accumulate,
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:33.000]   and there was this one kid in our neighborhood
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   who had a full box of marbles,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:38.000]   and he was the most popular kid in our neighborhood
[00:45:38.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   because he was really good at marbles.
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:42.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:45:42.000 --> 00:45:44.000]   And so some of us who had a little,
[00:45:44.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   you know, we would always envy,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.000]   and we would almost want to play him,
[00:45:47.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   but we could never beat him because he had so much.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   And I remember thinking back to that now,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:56.000]   they're all marbles, you know?
[00:45:56.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   And I remember one day I was able to play,
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   and I had a winning streak, and then he got mad,
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   and he bet the whole thing, and I won the whole thing.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   That was my most favorite childhood memory.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   And I remember that was the envy of all the kids
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.000]   in the neighborhood, but if you look at it now,
[00:46:15.000 --> 00:46:18.000]   how silly that was.
[00:46:18.000 --> 00:46:21.000]   But at that time, accumulating those marbles
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   seemed so important,
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   and the kids who had the most marbles
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:27.000]   were the most popular kids,
[00:46:27.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   and we tried so hard to be good at playing these marbles
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:33.000]   so we can accumulate more of it,
[00:46:33.000 --> 00:46:35.000]   but now as an adult looking back at it,
[00:46:35.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   it was worthless glass that we were fighting for.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   When we don't have a concept of where we're headed,
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   and we don't realize how fleeting this life is,
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   so many things that are so fleeting and is meaningless
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   become so important that we fight, we envy,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:59.000]   we covet, we sacrifice, we compromise, we sin
[00:46:59.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   in order to get that.
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   But in light of eternity, you're going to look back at it
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   and say they were just a bunch of marbles.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   They were meaningless.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:11.000]   So that's why he says contemplate,
[00:47:11.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   teach me to number our days
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   so that I may have a heart of wisdom,
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   that I may be able to see what is truly valuable
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   and what is worthless.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:23.000]   The whole Bible, number two, was written
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:27.000]   in the context of eternity.
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   You can't properly understand and apply the scriptures
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   unless you understand what he just says.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.000]   If our mind is not set on where we're headed
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   and we're so concerned that we get to the next stage
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   and you're not thinking about eternity,
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   scripture is not going to make a lot of sense to you,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   nor is it going to be relevant to you.
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   The biggest problem with the health and wealth gospel
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   is that they said if you sacrifice now,
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   if you give your money now,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   God will multiply 30 times 60 a hundredfold,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:06.000]   and it's not necessarily wrong.
[00:48:06.000 --> 00:48:08.000]   The scripture tells us to sacrifice
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   and that we will have great rewards in heaven.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   But the problem is they think the reward's
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:15.000]   going to happen tomorrow.
[00:48:15.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   They think the payoff's going to happen
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:20.000]   during this short period of time.
[00:48:20.000 --> 00:48:23.000]   So even though we easily point fingers and say,
[00:48:23.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   "Oh, the health and wealth gospel people,
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:27.000]   "they're teaching the false doctrine,"
[00:48:27.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   but how many of us work hard and sacrifice,
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   thinking that if I put in my time when I'm 19
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:35.000]   that the payoff's going to happen when I'm 22?
[00:48:35.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   If I sacrifice and put away a little bit,
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   I'm going to work hard and sacrifice
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:42.000]   so that I can have a better retirement.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   How much of our focus and sacrifice and work
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   is dedicated so that you can sacrifice here
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:53.000]   so that you can have a better life here?
[00:48:53.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   But when you look at it in the context of eternity,
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:48:59.000]   it means nothing.
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   It's just a very short period of time.
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:05.000]   We contemplate, right?
[00:49:05.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   So many theologians and denominations
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   argue over when is Jesus going to come.
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Is it before rapture?
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:14.000]   Is it going to be post-rapture?
[00:49:14.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   Is it amillennial? Is it postmillennial?
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   And all these things are good things to contemplate
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:21.000]   because they are in Scripture,
[00:49:21.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   but so much of our energy is fixated on
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:26.000]   the timing of the coming of Christ,
[00:49:26.000 --> 00:49:29.000]   trying to figure out when these things are going to happen,
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:32.000]   and not enough time is focused on
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:36.000]   the fact that we are going to go no matter what.
[00:49:36.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   Not simply on the time of when He's coming,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   but on the time of when we're going.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   Majority of us are going to go to Him before He comes.
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Majority of us are going to go to Him.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   And so there's all this argument about
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:54.000]   when He's going to come is interesting.
[00:49:54.000 --> 00:49:56.000]   And there's nothing wrong with it.
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   It's in the Scripture. We should be studying it.
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   But how much time do we dedicate to
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:05.000]   really understanding that we're going to go to Him?
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.000]   100%.
[00:50:08.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   When am I going to go to Him?
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:13.000]   When was the last time you thought about your death?
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   When was the last time you thought about your death?
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   You know, it's interesting, if you go online,
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   and you're like, "How long will I live?"
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   There's so many websites that will tell you.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   And they'll ask you your age,
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:29.000]   and then they'll tell you how much you got left.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   They'll ask you your height.
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   They'll ask you your weight.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   They'll ask you your health concerns.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   They'll ask you about, you know,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   your family history of illnesses or cancer.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:42.000]   And then you have about 20 questions that you ask,
[00:50:42.000 --> 00:50:45.000]   and then they calculate, and they'll tell you that
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:47.000]   based upon the answers that you gave,
[00:50:47.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   that you have this much to live.
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   Right?
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   Well, I did it.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:56.000]   I punched the numbers,
[00:50:56.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   and it said the probability
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   that I will live up to 73
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   is high, it says.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   And so if I live long,
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   maybe 83.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.000]   Right? That's what it says.
[00:51:12.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   That it will be somewhere between 73 to 83.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:18.000]   My father lived to 75,
[00:51:18.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   so in my mind, I'm thinking 75,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:22.000]   which is about 20 more years from now.
[00:51:22.000 --> 00:51:27.000]   20 more years isn't that long of a period.
[00:51:27.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   If I had 20 more years,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:33.000]   how would I want to live those 20 more years?
[00:51:33.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   How do I want my 2024 to look like
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:39.000]   if I had 20 more years?
[00:51:39.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   What will I do?
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:44.000]   How will I spend my time?
[00:51:44.000 --> 00:51:47.000]   How will it change my values?
[00:51:47.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   Maybe some of you may think
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   that you have longer time, right,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:53.000]   because you're younger.
[00:51:53.000 --> 00:51:55.000]   Some of you guys are older.
[00:51:55.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   Whatever it is,
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   whether you have 60 more years,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   or whether you have 20 more years,
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:03.000]   or whether you have 10 more years,
[00:52:03.000 --> 00:52:05.000]   at the end of it,
[00:52:05.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   you're all going to say the same thing.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:09.000]   Wow, that went fast.
[00:52:09.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   That went fast.
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:13.000]   You have small children now.
[00:52:13.000 --> 00:52:15.000]   Next thing you know, you turn around.
[00:52:15.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   They're driving the car, and they're leaving the house.
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:19.000]   Wow, that went fast.
[00:52:19.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   Nobody at the end of their life
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   say, "Wow, that took long.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   That didn't go as fast as I wanted."
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Nobody. I've never heard anybody say that.
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   Every single person,
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   as the time passes, you look back at it
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   and say, "Wow, that went fast."
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   In Colossians 3, 2-4, it says,
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   "Set your mind on the things above,
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.000]   not on the things that are on earth.
[00:52:42.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed,
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   then you also will be revealed with him in glory."
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   I'm going to read one more quote
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:55.000]   before I want to show you a video.
[00:52:55.000 --> 00:52:57.000]   From "Mere Christianity" by C.S. Lewis,
[00:52:57.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   it says, "If you read history,
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   you will find that Christians
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:03.000]   who thought most for the present world
[00:53:03.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   were just those who thought most of the next.
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   It is since Christians have largely ceased
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   to think of the other world
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   that they have become so ineffective in this.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:16.000]   Aim at heaven, and you will get earth thrown in.
[00:53:16.000 --> 00:53:20.000]   Aim at earth, and you will get neither."
[00:53:20.000 --> 00:53:23.000]   How many of us are aiming for heaven?
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:27.000]   How many of us are aiming for earth?
[00:53:27.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   Even the way you're raising your children.
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   How many of you are raising your children
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   to aim for heaven, not earth?
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Not so that they can be successful,
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:39.000]   not so that they can be great,
[00:53:39.000 --> 00:53:43.000]   not so that they can be honored while they're here.
[00:53:43.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   How much of our focus in raising our children
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   is so that they would treasure heaven?
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   When was the last time you talked about death
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:53.000]   with your children?
[00:53:53.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   One day, I'm not going to be here.
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:58.000]   One day, you're not going to be here.
[00:53:58.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   One day, Grandma's not going to be here.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   One day, we're going to be buried.
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   When you get buried,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:06.000]   how would you want to be buried?
[00:54:06.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   Do you want to be buried?
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   Do you want to be cremated?
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   It seems morbid to think about it.
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   I don't want to scare--
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   I don't want to make my children sad.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:16.000]   But the Scripture says
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   it's good to be in the house of mourning
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:20.000]   because it gives us a heart of wisdom
[00:54:20.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   to think about the end
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   because that is exactly where we're all headed.
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   And for Christians, it is not morbid.
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   That's where our hope lies.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   The whole reason why we are believers in Christ
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:33.000]   is not so that we can have a better life here.
[00:54:33.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   It's so that we can have a better eternity.
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:38.000]   And yet, we know that that's true,
[00:54:38.000 --> 00:54:42.000]   and yet we think and meditate so little.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   We prepare so little for eternity.
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:47.000]   We think about eternity.
[00:54:47.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   We sing about eternity.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:53.000]   We study about eternity, right?
[00:54:53.000 --> 00:54:57.000]   And yet, so little is planned
[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   for where we're all headed, right?
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:03.000]   Third and final thing,
[00:55:03.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   when we think about our death,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   it helps us to enjoy what we have now.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:09.000]   It's not just like we're going to go home.
[00:55:09.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   We're going to be so sad.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:13.000]   Knowing that our time is short
[00:55:13.000 --> 00:55:16.000]   helps us to enjoy what we have here, right?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:18.000]   When you're raising young children,
[00:55:18.000 --> 00:55:20.000]   you're so eager to get them to the next stage,
[00:55:20.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   and you don't really enjoy the kid during that period.
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   But if you knew for a fact
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   how quickly that period passes,
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:33.000]   you would appreciate what you have much more.
[00:55:33.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   The stage that you have is a short period of time.
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   You're going to wake up one day, and they're gone.
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   So knowing the end is going to come quickly,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:47.000]   it helps us to appreciate everything that we have.
[00:55:47.000 --> 00:55:49.000]   Not only does it help us to appreciate what we have,
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:52.000]   second, it helps us to endure through hardship,
[00:55:52.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   because even that will pass.
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   No matter how difficult of a situation that you're in,
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   no matter how hard the trial may seem,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:03.000]   knowing that we are headed toward eternity
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:07.000]   helps us to see that this is all temporary.
[00:56:07.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   So the temporary things that are good,
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   it helps us to enjoy it more,
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   and the temporary hardships that come into our life,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   it helps us to endure it better.
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   And so as we look to the new year in 2024,
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:24.000]   I want us to contemplate together,
[00:56:24.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   how would we spend 2024 if you knew that this was it?
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   If you knew that this was it,
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:37.000]   how would you treat your wife, your husband, your children,
[00:56:37.000 --> 00:56:41.000]   the friends, the church, your walk with God?
[00:56:41.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   What things would you change if 2024 was your last year?
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Because one of these days, it will be.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:54.000]   100%.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:58.000]   One of these days, I'm going to say what I'm saying now,
[00:56:58.000 --> 00:57:01.000]   and it will be reality,
[00:57:01.000 --> 00:57:03.000]   that that will be my last sermon,
[00:57:03.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   that that will be my last encouragement,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   and it will be your last worship that you give.
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   So in 2024, what will we change?
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:13.000]   So I want to watch this video.
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   It's a short three-minute video,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   and then I'm going to break us up into groups
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   and take some time to pray with each other
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   before we say Happy New Year.
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   If you can turn that video on.
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   No, not yet.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:36.000]   This is your life.
[00:57:36.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   It looks pretty full, doesn't it?
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:40.000]   That's because it is.
[00:57:40.000 --> 00:57:43.000]   It's full of all the things you'd be incomplete without.
[00:57:43.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   Love, family, food, water, health,
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   your parents, your passions.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   With all of these things,
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:53.000]   you could have nothing else and still lead a full life.
[00:57:53.000 --> 00:57:55.000]   But even with all of this,
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   you'll still have some space to fit more things,
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   smaller things.
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   This is your job, your car, your house, money.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   Things that are still important.
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:07.000]   But if you took them all away,
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   your life would still be full.
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   If you're watching this video,
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:14.000]   that means you're lucky enough
[00:58:14.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   to have at least some of these things.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   But if you're really lucky,
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:19.000]   and many of us are,
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   you'll still have some space left over.
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   These are the really small things.
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:25.000]   Watching a movie,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   playing a video game,
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   sports,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   ice cream.
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:32.000]   Things that make your life that little bit nicer,
[00:58:32.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   but things that are really just trivial in the end.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   If you wanted,
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:41.000]   you could try to put these things first.
[00:58:41.000 --> 00:58:43.000]   Wasting your time in front of the television,
[00:58:43.000 --> 00:58:44.000]   or the computer,
[00:58:44.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   playing games,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   or whatever it might be.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:49.000]   You could follow it up with the material things.
[00:58:49.000 --> 00:58:53.000]   Money, cars, houses, clothes.
[00:58:53.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   But then when it comes time to try to fit in
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   all the important things,
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:58:58.000]   you run out of space.
[00:58:58.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   Some things will have to be left out.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   And nobody wants that.
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:07.000]   So keep that in mind as you go through life.
[00:59:07.000 --> 00:59:09.000]   Put the really important things first,
[00:59:09.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   and then find space for the rest.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.000]   If you run out,
[00:59:12.000 --> 00:59:14.000]   it really won't matter anyways.
[00:59:14.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   It's just the small stuff.
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   [Music]
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   [Music]
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   [Music]
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:21.000]   [Music]
[00:59:21.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   [Music]
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:24.000]   [Music]
[00:59:24.000 --> 00:59:29.000]   [Music]
[00:59:29.000 --> 00:59:34.000]   [Music]
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   [Music]
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   [Music]
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   [Music]
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:54.000]   [Music]
[00:59:54.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   [Music]
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:04.000]   [Music]
[01:00:04.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   And then that we live our life purposefully.
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:09.000]   So why don't we do this?
[01:00:09.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   If you're here with your families,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   if you can break up with your families,
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   take some time to pray.
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   If you don't finish,
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:18.000]   we'll give you time to finish after the countdown.
[01:00:18.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   So you don't necessarily have to rush.
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   But if you can break up,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:24.000]   or if you're here with other friends,
[01:00:24.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   just kind of get in a little circle
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:28.000]   of maybe about four or five people.
[01:00:28.000 --> 01:00:30.000]   And then we're going to have to do this quick
[01:00:30.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   or else while we're separating,
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:34.000]   we're going to say "Happy New Year."
[01:00:34.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   Okay?
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   So if you're here with your family,
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   just grab your family
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   and then get in a small circle.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   And then a few minutes before the countdown,
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:46.000]   we'll come up, do the countdown,
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   say "Happy New Year,"
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   and then we'll let you take a few minutes
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:50.000]   of your prayer time.
[01:00:50.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Okay?
[01:00:52.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:05.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:05.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:11.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:11.000 --> 01:01:14.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:14.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:23.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:23.000 --> 01:01:26.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:26.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   [Laughter]
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:38.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:38.000 --> 01:01:41.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:41.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   [Laughter]
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:47.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:47.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   [Laughter]
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:08.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:08.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:14.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:14.000 --> 01:02:17.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:17.000 --> 01:02:20.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:20.000 --> 01:02:23.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:23.000 --> 01:02:26.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:26.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:38.000]   [Laughter]
[01:02:38.000 --> 01:02:41.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:02:41.000 --> 01:02:44.000]   [Laughter]

[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   [Laughter]

[01:03:05.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   [Laughter]
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:14.000]   [Laughter]

[01:03:29.000 --> 01:03:32.000]   [Laughter]
[01:03:32.000 --> 01:03:35.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:03:35.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   [Laughter]
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.000]   [Laughter]

[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   [Laughter]

[01:03:59.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   [Laughter]
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:05.000]   [Prayer is sung]
[01:04:05.000 --> 01:04:08.000]   [Laughter]

[01:25:09.000 --> 01:25:30.000]   All glory be to Christ, our King. All glory be to Christ.
[01:25:30.000 --> 01:25:46.000]   His rule and reign will ever sing. All glory be to Christ.
[01:25:46.000 --> 01:25:56.000]   Let's pray. Father, we thank you so much for our brothers and sisters, Lord, in this church where we can run this race together.
[01:25:56.000 --> 01:26:02.000]   Lord, in times of celebration, Lord, that we would be able to come together and rejoice together.
[01:26:02.000 --> 01:26:07.000]   But also in times of mourning, Lord God, and in hardship.
[01:26:07.000 --> 01:26:14.000]   That our brothers and sisters around us would be the people that we lean on, that we would gain strength in.
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:19.000]   That we are sharpened by, and at times even rebuked, Lord God.
[01:26:19.000 --> 01:26:26.000]   I pray that you would knit our hearts together as one. That you would truly give us a heart of wisdom.
[01:26:26.000 --> 01:26:34.000]   That in 2024, whatever it is that you have ordained, that we would greet it, Lord God, with confidence.
[01:26:34.000 --> 01:26:43.000]   That you would be at the center. Lord, as we go our own way, help us, Lord God, to make you our first.
[01:26:43.000 --> 01:26:47.000]   That you would not simply be Lord, Lord, on our lips.
[01:26:47.000 --> 01:26:52.000]   But our whole year, Lord God, that we would pursue you with all our might.
[01:26:52.000 --> 01:26:58.000]   May Christ, in Christ alone, be magnified in our lives. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:26:58.000 --> 01:27:04.000]   Alright, so if we can take a few minutes just to say, greet one another, say hello, happy new year.
[01:27:04.000 --> 01:27:09.000]   And then, if we can make our way out of the sanctuary.
[01:27:09.000 --> 01:27:12.000]   And then we'll see you next Sunday at 8 a.m.
[01:27:12.000 --> 01:27:14.000]   Okay? Alright.
