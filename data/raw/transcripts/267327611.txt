[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   I think that's it for the announcement.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.400]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 13.
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:13.440]   I'm going to read all the way from verse 8 to 14, but our focus is going to be on verses
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:18.360]   11 through 14.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:19.360]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:25.040]   "Owe no one anything except to love each other, for the one who loves another has fulfilled
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:26.040]   the law.
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:28.920]   For the commandments, you shall not commit adultery, you shall not murder, you shall
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:33.400]   not steal, you shall not covet, and any other commandment are summed up in this word, you
[00:00:33.400 --> 00:00:35.900]   shall love your neighbor as yourself.
[00:00:35.900 --> 00:00:40.680]   Love does no wrong to the neighbor, therefore love is the fulfilling of the law.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:45.160]   Besides this, you know the time that the hour has come for you to awake from sleep, for
[00:00:45.160 --> 00:00:49.480]   salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed.
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:53.640]   The night is far gone, the day is at hand, so then let us cast off the works of darkness
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:55.840]   and put on the armor of light.
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.920]   Let us walk properly as in the daytime, not in orgies and drunkenness, not in sexual immorality
[00:00:59.920 --> 00:01:05.640]   and sensuality, not in quarreling and jealousy, but put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.760]   no provision for the flesh to gratify its desires."
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:15.440]   Let's pray.
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:21.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you that it is by your mercy and your grace, Lord God, that
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:28.360]   we are able to come to your throne to worship, to hear from you.
[00:01:28.360 --> 00:01:35.920]   I pray, Father God, that only your word would go forth, no human reasoning, no human experience,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:43.040]   no human logic, only your word, Lord God, that your children will hear from you.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:47.440]   We know, Father God, that there's no human comforter, no human counsel, Lord, can take
[00:01:47.440 --> 00:01:50.580]   the place of encountering you.
[00:01:50.580 --> 00:01:55.520]   So we ask, Lord God, that you would be gracious to us, that you would allow your presence,
[00:01:55.520 --> 00:01:58.760]   Lord, to be known in a tangible way.
[00:01:58.760 --> 00:02:02.280]   May this room be filled, Lord God, with your grace.
[00:02:02.280 --> 00:02:05.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:11.820]   One other announcement is that, as you guys know, we've been trying to incorporate more
[00:02:11.820 --> 00:02:15.960]   corporate prayer in our church, and we've been having various discussions in our leadership
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:17.560]   on how to do that.
[00:02:17.560 --> 00:02:20.940]   And one of the things that we've implemented on Friday nights, once a month, we have praise
[00:02:20.940 --> 00:02:27.920]   and prayer night, and so we just had one this last Friday, but we're also very aware that
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:31.140]   meeting together once a month is not enough.
[00:02:31.140 --> 00:02:34.860]   The early church was devoted to prayer, and so we want to make sure that we're devoted
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:36.340]   to praying.
[00:02:36.340 --> 00:02:40.540]   So another thing that we wanted to implement is try to implement more corporate prayer
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:42.840]   in Sunday service.
[00:02:42.840 --> 00:02:47.240]   So we had various discussions, and the conclusion that we came to, without disrupting what's
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.660]   happening already, is that what we're going to do, starting from not next Sunday, but
[00:02:51.660 --> 00:02:57.320]   the Sunday after that, when Elder Joe is back up here leading worship, we're going to have
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:03:02.060]   a shorter worship service in the front, and then the main worship time is going to be
[00:03:02.060 --> 00:03:03.060]   after the sermon.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:10.640]   So it's not going to be a major change, it's going to be just priority in the worship after
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:11.640]   the sermon.
[00:03:11.640 --> 00:03:17.200]   So the reason we're doing that is, one, I think we worship better, you know, oftentimes
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.160]   after we hear the Word of God and are convicted, and also we want to give extra time for people
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:24.460]   to respond in prayer.
[00:03:24.460 --> 00:03:29.280]   So during that time, as we are worshiping, as the Lord leads, that our church would spend
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.320]   extended period, again, if you want to sit down, stand up, and just really come before
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:37.020]   the Lord in praying together.
[00:03:37.020 --> 00:03:42.140]   And so again, we're not saying that that is enough, but we're trying to implement more
[00:03:42.140 --> 00:03:48.000]   ways that our church can be more mindful of how we are desperately in need of prayer.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.580]   So that's one of the things that we're doing.
[00:03:49.580 --> 00:03:53.660]   So Friday, praise and prayer, and also on Sunday, we're going to do that.
[00:03:53.660 --> 00:03:56.020]   And again, we're going to implement that in a couple weeks, and we'll give you a heads
[00:03:56.020 --> 00:03:57.780]   up before that happens.
[00:03:57.780 --> 00:04:03.060]   And again, Elder Joe is going to lead us in that time.
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:07.540]   Prayer, as we've mentioned on Friday, and as I've been talking about, is one of those
[00:04:07.540 --> 00:04:12.420]   disciplines that you just absolutely cannot do in the flesh.
[00:04:12.420 --> 00:04:17.820]   You can read your Bible when you're not spiritually focused.
[00:04:17.820 --> 00:04:22.040]   You could have had a week where you just kind of indulge in the flesh and you come to Bible
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:25.800]   study because all you have to do is engage your mind and just kind of study like you
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.900]   did at school.
[00:04:27.900 --> 00:04:30.000]   You can serve the church because it's physical.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:33.360]   You can have all kinds of things going on in your heart, but you can physically come
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:34.720]   in here and do these things.
[00:04:34.720 --> 00:04:40.360]   But prayer is one of those things that if your mind and your heart wasn't sober before
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:47.760]   you began to pray, you'll see right away where you are in your walk with God can easily be
[00:04:47.760 --> 00:04:53.300]   seen as soon as you close your eyes and try to discipline to pray.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:58.200]   Because the scripture says that the Holy Spirit is in us and groaning on our behalf.
[00:04:58.200 --> 00:05:01.520]   And he also said that if you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:05:01.520 --> 00:05:03.400]   Then ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:08.220]   So in other words, if our mind and heart and our life is going one direction and we come
[00:05:08.220 --> 00:05:14.820]   to pray and we're praying the other direction, the Holy Spirit in our flesh is in conflict.
[00:05:14.820 --> 00:05:19.480]   And so as soon as we come before the Lord in prayer, you see that conflict that's happening
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:20.480]   even in your own mind.
[00:05:20.480 --> 00:05:22.800]   So it's just even trying to get the words out.
[00:05:22.800 --> 00:05:27.040]   Because your mind is thinking about things that have nothing to do with God, and yet
[00:05:27.040 --> 00:05:32.120]   you're trying to say things before God that you know that God wants us to pray for.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.360]   So therefore we see that conflict.
[00:05:33.360 --> 00:05:38.080]   So if you want to see where you are in your walk with God, you can tell immediately in
[00:05:38.080 --> 00:05:40.160]   your prayer life.
[00:05:40.160 --> 00:05:44.520]   Whether you are consistently walking according to the Spirit or whether you are walking contrary
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:50.440]   to the Spirit, you can see the fruit of it immediately when you are praying.
[00:05:50.440 --> 00:05:56.100]   And again, prayer is not one of those things that you can do simply in the flesh.
[00:05:56.100 --> 00:06:00.680]   And that's why it says in 1 Peter that our relationship with our wives, and again, it's
[00:06:00.680 --> 00:06:06.360]   not just with our wives, but to treat her with honor so that we can pray.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:10.280]   So in other words, if we're not honorable at home, if we're not living soberly, it'll
[00:06:10.280 --> 00:06:11.900]   affect the way that we pray.
[00:06:11.900 --> 00:06:16.720]   And that's true not just in our home, but in everything else that we do.
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:25.520]   See, Christianity was never meant to be a half-hearted commitment.
[00:06:25.520 --> 00:06:31.440]   It was never meant to be given to God half-hearted worship, because the very idea of worship
[00:06:31.440 --> 00:06:34.320]   requires full commitment.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:36.960]   You can't come in and say, "You know what?
[00:06:36.960 --> 00:06:40.760]   I'm going to give a part of myself to worship," because then that isn't worship.
[00:06:40.760 --> 00:06:41.760]   That's religion.
[00:06:41.760 --> 00:06:43.860]   That could be superstition.
[00:06:43.860 --> 00:06:45.280]   That's just going through the motions.
[00:06:45.280 --> 00:06:49.200]   Worship requires a pouring out of our heart.
[00:06:49.200 --> 00:06:54.000]   When we see who God is, when we see who Jesus is, and we're enamored and we forget everything
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:59.600]   else and we're just focused on his glory, that's worship.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:06.240]   So the very nature of worship requires a full commitment.
[00:07:06.240 --> 00:07:08.760]   That's exactly what Jesus says in Luke 10.27.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.560]   What is the greatest commitment?
[00:07:11.560 --> 00:07:17.720]   Considering all the other things that they were committed to do as Pharisees, over 600
[00:07:17.720 --> 00:07:20.300]   different laws, what's the greatest thing?
[00:07:20.300 --> 00:07:24.100]   Because we can't possibly do all of them, which one should we focus on?
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:29.460]   Jesus says, "Love the Lord with all your heart, with all your soul, with all your strength,
[00:07:29.460 --> 00:07:32.300]   with all your mind."
[00:07:32.300 --> 00:07:35.260]   The point of that is not, "How do we worship God with our heart?
[00:07:35.260 --> 00:07:36.540]   How do we worship God with our mind?
[00:07:36.540 --> 00:07:38.180]   How do we worship God with our strength?"
[00:07:38.180 --> 00:07:42.180]   The point of it is the "all" part.
[00:07:42.180 --> 00:07:48.700]   He says the greatest commandment is to surrender all of it.
[00:07:48.700 --> 00:07:53.620]   Isn't that what Paul says in Romans chapter 12.1, in view of this mercy, to present your
[00:07:53.620 --> 00:07:56.420]   body as a living sacrifice?
[00:07:56.420 --> 00:07:59.940]   A sacrifice isn't half-offered.
[00:07:59.940 --> 00:08:04.400]   There is no lamb walking around with one leg or two legs.
[00:08:04.400 --> 00:08:07.540]   If a lamb was sacrificed, it is dead.
[00:08:07.540 --> 00:08:08.620]   It's complete.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:11.680]   There is no half-sacrifice.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:18.080]   So when he says, in view of this mercy, to offer your body as a living sacrifice, it
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.000]   automatically means to die, to give all that you have.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.520]   In Deuteronomy chapter 4.29, God says, "This is the nation of Israel, but from there you
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:34.400]   will seek the Lord your God, and you will find him if," and that's a big "if," "if you
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:39.840]   search after him with all your heart and with all your soul."
[00:08:39.840 --> 00:08:42.520]   He made a condition.
[00:08:42.520 --> 00:08:48.040]   You will seek me and find me once you make up your mind that this is what you want.
[00:08:48.040 --> 00:08:53.120]   Isn't that what Joshua challenges the nation of Israel after all those years of being in
[00:08:53.120 --> 00:08:54.680]   the Promised Land?
[00:08:54.680 --> 00:09:01.200]   And at the end of his life, he challenges them, "Stop teeter-tottering between two opinions.
[00:09:01.200 --> 00:09:05.000]   If the Lord is God, worship him.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:07.440]   If Paul is God, worship him.
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:12.480]   But make up your mind, for me and my household, we will serve the Lord."
[00:09:12.480 --> 00:09:17.920]   He says, "You will find me if you seek me with all your heart."
[00:09:17.920 --> 00:09:19.640]   Jeremiah 29 verse 13.
[00:09:19.640 --> 00:09:23.320]   You will seek me and find me when you seek me with all of your heart.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:31.360]   And over and over again, the Bible says, God is not somebody that you can find half-heartedly.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:35.840]   God is not somebody that you're going to meet when you have not fully surrendered.
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.120]   And that's what repentance means.
[00:09:38.120 --> 00:09:44.280]   The call to repentance is not to simply recognize that what I did on Monday was wrong, that
[00:09:44.280 --> 00:09:47.080]   the way I spent my money was wrong.
[00:09:47.080 --> 00:09:51.560]   Repentance basically means my whole life was wrong.
[00:09:51.560 --> 00:09:58.640]   All of me, everything that I sought, everything that I thought was good, everything that I
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:10:01.700]   thought was righteous was wrong.
[00:10:01.700 --> 00:10:07.000]   And so repentance is coming before God and surrendering your life, not just your youth,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.400]   not just a part of your finances, but your life.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:12.240]   This is consistent all throughout Scripture.
[00:10:12.240 --> 00:10:17.120]   And that's why Paul says in the new covenant in 1 Corinthians 9 24, "Do you not know that
[00:10:17.120 --> 00:10:23.120]   in all, in the race, all runners compete, but only one receives the prize?
[00:10:23.120 --> 00:10:26.920]   So run that you may obtain it."
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:33.420]   But even in the new covenant, God requires a worship from people who have absolutely
[00:10:33.420 --> 00:10:36.500]   surrendered their life.
[00:10:36.500 --> 00:10:43.460]   You can't give a nonchalant, half-hearted worship because by definition that's not worship.
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:48.300]   You can't give leftovers to God because by definition that's not worship.
[00:10:48.300 --> 00:10:55.220]   The definition of worship in and of itself requires an absolute surrender.
[00:10:55.220 --> 00:11:00.300]   And see, nothing reveals that more than in our prayers.
[00:11:00.300 --> 00:11:02.480]   Because you cannot pray.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:04.120]   You can motion in prayer.
[00:11:04.120 --> 00:11:06.900]   You can say and regurgitate information.
[00:11:06.900 --> 00:11:08.140]   You can say, "Wrote prayer."
[00:11:08.140 --> 00:11:11.100]   You can write down your prayer and read your prayer.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:19.560]   But prayer that is powerful, that comes before God petitioning, requires all surrender.
[00:11:19.560 --> 00:11:21.860]   It requires crying out to God.
[00:11:21.860 --> 00:11:27.980]   And until we make up our mind that that's what we want, we cannot pray.
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:29.900]   You can do religious praying.
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:32.900]   You can gather together for small group praying.
[00:11:32.900 --> 00:11:34.020]   You can write down your prayer.
[00:11:34.020 --> 00:11:35.300]   You can rehearse your prayer.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.380]   You can memorize your prayer.
[00:11:37.380 --> 00:11:42.940]   But the prayer that Jesus says that he will answer, "If you abide in me, in my words I
[00:11:42.940 --> 00:11:43.940]   abide in you.
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:44.940]   Ask whatever you wish.
[00:11:44.940 --> 00:11:48.080]   It shall be done for you."
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:52.120]   The greatest asset to any Christian is prayer.
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:56.500]   Because prayer is what connects us to this holy God.
[00:11:56.500 --> 00:12:00.980]   Everything that you and I know, everything that you and I know was created by this God
[00:12:00.980 --> 00:12:03.100]   that we pray to.
[00:12:03.100 --> 00:12:06.480]   And we have this access to this God.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:08.340]   So what else do we have?
[00:12:08.340 --> 00:12:11.040]   There's no amount of money that can replace that.
[00:12:11.040 --> 00:12:13.000]   There are no amount of talent.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.500]   There's no amount of organization.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:23.000]   There's no amount of hard work that will ever come close to simply praying and the Holy
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:28.340]   Spirit coming and supernaturally doing what he chooses to do.
[00:12:28.340 --> 00:12:33.200]   So prayer is the most effective, most powerful thing that we can do as a Christian.
[00:12:33.200 --> 00:12:41.360]   And yet, prayer is not something you can do half-heartedly until you have absolutely committed.
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:45.560]   We've all prayed powerful prayers before.
[00:12:45.560 --> 00:12:49.340]   But we've only prayed when something was urgent.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:55.100]   Whether someone was sick, something desperate, there was an emergency, and you prayed.
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:12:58.640]   Whether it was your life or someone else's life, you prayed because there was a sense
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:12:59.640]   of urgency.
[00:12:59.640 --> 00:13:01.360]   And that's the struggle that you and I are in.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:05.520]   It is not like that all over the world.
[00:13:05.520 --> 00:13:10.200]   There are some parts of the world where just by saying that they're Christian, there is
[00:13:10.200 --> 00:13:14.520]   a sense of urgency in them because it's not safe to gather together.
[00:13:14.520 --> 00:13:16.940]   It's not safe to pray together.
[00:13:16.940 --> 00:13:19.280]   But that is not our problem.
[00:13:19.280 --> 00:13:25.560]   Our problem in Orange County is that there is no sense of urgency.
[00:13:25.560 --> 00:13:33.000]   And Orange County is not a place that people come to necessarily do things.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:35.840]   This is where people come to settle down.
[00:13:35.840 --> 00:13:37.360]   This is what Orange County is known for.
[00:13:37.360 --> 00:13:42.400]   And it is a blessing because I'd rather have my kids here and not have to worry about them
[00:13:42.400 --> 00:13:45.100]   being shot or having to eat.
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.280]   So I'm glad we're in Orange County.
[00:13:48.280 --> 00:13:52.480]   I remember talking to a friend who's a pastor out in Seoul, Korea.
[00:13:52.480 --> 00:13:54.760]   And he's doing English ministry.
[00:13:54.760 --> 00:13:59.720]   And we were just sharing about the challenges that we have in ministry.
[00:13:59.720 --> 00:14:02.800]   And his challenges there and challenges here are so different.
[00:14:02.800 --> 00:14:06.800]   And I asked him, I said, "It must be so challenging for you because the group that he works with
[00:14:06.800 --> 00:14:07.800]   are all transient.
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:13.080]   Because they're all expats who are there for work or vacation or something.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:15.280]   But they're all in the context of moving around."
[00:14:15.280 --> 00:14:18.800]   And I asked him, "It must be hard because here in Orange County, most people are here
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:19.800]   for good.
[00:14:19.800 --> 00:14:24.260]   In fact, a lot of people move here because they want to get a job and it's a good place
[00:14:24.260 --> 00:14:26.680]   to raise your children."
[00:14:26.680 --> 00:14:28.160]   And he said, "On the contrary."
[00:14:28.160 --> 00:14:35.200]   He said, "He's a pastor who actually did church planting in this area before he went out to
[00:14:35.200 --> 00:14:36.200]   create."
[00:14:36.200 --> 00:14:41.840]   And I said, "No, actually, it's a lot easier to do ministry out there."
[00:14:41.840 --> 00:14:47.600]   And the reason why, he said, is because the majority of the expats already left home.
[00:14:47.600 --> 00:14:48.600]   So they're not home.
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:49.920]   So they're not comfortable.
[00:14:49.920 --> 00:14:52.640]   So when they come to church, they cling to each other.
[00:14:52.640 --> 00:14:56.820]   And it's easy to mobilize people who have already left their home and living outside
[00:14:56.820 --> 00:15:00.040]   of their comfort zone to gather them together and gather the energy.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:04.320]   So it's easy to kind of mobilize them and send them out to missions and do challenging
[00:15:04.320 --> 00:15:07.840]   things because they've already left their home.
[00:15:07.840 --> 00:15:11.040]   But that's not the challenge that we have here.
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:14.280]   Orange County is where we come to settle down.
[00:15:14.280 --> 00:15:18.600]   We go out to missions and then we come here to raise kids.
[00:15:18.600 --> 00:15:21.160]   None of these things are evil.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:25.120]   These are, in my opinion, blessings that God has given us.
[00:15:25.120 --> 00:15:29.640]   But when we don't recognize the stewardship that we have of what God has given us, this
[00:15:29.640 --> 00:15:35.080]   blessing can easily cause us to blind us, to harden us.
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:38.040]   And there's no longer a sense of urgency in what we're doing.
[00:15:38.040 --> 00:15:45.280]   And the reason why Paul is getting to that in verse 11 is because he's given these instructions.
[00:15:45.280 --> 00:15:51.720]   And typically in a situation, it's not a "no."
[00:15:51.720 --> 00:15:58.320]   When there is no sense of urgency, it's always, "I will, just not now."
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:02.480]   Paul is reminding them of the sense of urgency of the gospel.
[00:16:02.480 --> 00:16:07.560]   And that's why Apostle Paul, when he preached the gospel, he said it was his passion to
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:09.720]   preach the gospel where it was not preached.
[00:16:09.720 --> 00:16:14.800]   In fact, this very letter is written to prepare and to get some support so that he can go
[00:16:14.800 --> 00:16:16.320]   to Spain.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:21.380]   He never gets there because he gets imprisoned and then he ends up dying in prison.
[00:16:21.380 --> 00:16:25.560]   But the letter is written in the context of urgency.
[00:16:25.560 --> 00:16:29.040]   And that's the danger that you and I are in.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:31.440]   It's not that we're not good people.
[00:16:31.440 --> 00:16:33.040]   It's not that we're not doing our part.
[00:16:33.040 --> 00:16:36.000]   It's not that we don't take the Bible seriously.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.520]   But because there is no sense of urgency, we pray.
[00:16:40.520 --> 00:16:42.480]   We pray casually.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.040]   We evangelize casually.
[00:16:45.040 --> 00:16:47.480]   We seek the Lord casually.
[00:16:47.480 --> 00:16:52.680]   And even when we see our hearts hardened, we always think to ourselves, "We have plenty
[00:16:52.680 --> 00:16:56.080]   of time to deal with this, if not today, tomorrow.
[00:16:56.080 --> 00:16:58.360]   If not tomorrow, the next day."
[00:16:58.360 --> 00:17:05.360]   Not realizing that whole time, your condition is getting worse and worse and worse.
[00:17:05.360 --> 00:17:13.080]   Paul has made this plea to the Roman church to live out their salvation, to practice this
[00:17:13.080 --> 00:17:16.660]   love that the world is not going to understand.
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:22.240]   But now, in four different ways, he talks about the urgency of time.
[00:17:22.240 --> 00:17:26.480]   So my intention originally was to cover all four verses, but I didn't get to that in first
[00:17:26.480 --> 00:17:29.400]   service, so I'm not going to get that here.
[00:17:29.400 --> 00:17:37.440]   So I'm just going to cover this morning Paul's plea for urgency to practice what he's been
[00:17:37.440 --> 00:17:39.360]   saying.
[00:17:39.360 --> 00:17:44.560]   You know how if you get a mail, a lot of times the way that people try to get you to open
[00:17:44.560 --> 00:17:47.520]   the mail is that this mail is time-sensitive, right?
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:50.360]   And you must respond in three days.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:52.720]   So I'm sure all of you have experienced that.
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:57.880]   And automatically, you know it's junk mail, but just in case, right?
[00:17:57.880 --> 00:18:01.640]   What if it's money?
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:02.640]   What if it's the IRS?
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:08.280]   You know, 10 out of 10 times, it's usually nothing, right?
[00:18:08.280 --> 00:18:10.080]   But just in case.
[00:18:10.080 --> 00:18:16.320]   But they do that because they want to get your attention, that this is important.
[00:18:16.320 --> 00:18:18.420]   And that's exactly what Paul is doing here.
[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:26.280]   He uses the idea of time to instill in them that this is not something that you can postpone.
[00:18:26.280 --> 00:18:30.840]   This is not something that you can do tomorrow or the next day.
[00:18:30.840 --> 00:18:35.440]   Delaying obedience is disobedience.
[00:18:35.440 --> 00:18:38.360]   Any of you who've raised children know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:45.240]   If you tell a child to do something and they don't want to do it, they don't say no because
[00:18:45.240 --> 00:18:47.700]   they have to eat.
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:51.120]   They know the trouble that's coming if they say no.
[00:18:51.120 --> 00:18:54.480]   So if they don't want to do it, what do they say?
[00:18:54.480 --> 00:18:57.040]   I will.
[00:18:57.040 --> 00:18:58.780]   And then they won't do it.
[00:18:58.780 --> 00:19:01.120]   You come back later, "How come you didn't do it?"
[00:19:01.120 --> 00:19:04.040]   I will do it.
[00:19:04.040 --> 00:19:06.760]   Then you come back later, "I said you were going to do it."
[00:19:06.760 --> 00:19:08.320]   "Well, I got caught up doing something."
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.760]   "I told you I was going to do it."
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:11.760]   And it doesn't get done.
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.040]   Then you get so frustrated, you just end up doing it yourself, right?
[00:19:16.040 --> 00:19:20.240]   To delay obedience is disobedience.
[00:19:20.240 --> 00:19:23.400]   And that's why he is giving a sense of urgency.
[00:19:23.400 --> 00:19:28.880]   So the first thing that he says in verse 11, after giving these imperatives, he says, "Beside
[00:19:28.880 --> 00:19:32.740]   this, you know the time."
[00:19:32.740 --> 00:19:35.320]   The time that he uses here, the word kairos.
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.300]   Kronos is the word that they use in Greek to say it's one o'clock, ten o'clock, or today.
[00:19:41.300 --> 00:19:47.200]   But the word kronos, or kairos, oftentimes is translated season, a particularly appointed
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:49.160]   time.
[00:19:49.160 --> 00:19:53.760]   And so Paul says, "All of these things I'm instructing to you, there's a sense of urgency
[00:19:53.760 --> 00:20:00.100]   because you know that I'm talking to you because the time has come."
[00:20:00.100 --> 00:20:06.200]   And then he says, "You know," meaning that he's not saying anything new to them.
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:12.040]   That if you heard the gospel, that there was a certain level of urgency that came with
[00:20:12.040 --> 00:20:14.340]   the gospel truth.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:20.580]   So apostle Paul, obviously, was going from city to city, even being beaten, stoned, jailed,
[00:20:20.580 --> 00:20:21.680]   whipped.
[00:20:21.680 --> 00:20:25.580]   And so even by his very life, you could tell that there's an urgency to this.
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:31.260]   But the very message itself is not simply because Paul said it.
[00:20:31.260 --> 00:20:34.400]   It's not simply because he modeled it.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:40.800]   But the message itself comes with a sense of urgency.
[00:20:40.800 --> 00:20:50.020]   You can't say that without Christ there's damnation and not sense a sense of urgency.
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:53.200]   Because that betrays our message.
[00:20:53.200 --> 00:20:59.080]   If we share the gospel without a sense of urgency, it nullifies the message itself.
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:04.040]   If somebody comes into this room and says, "The building's going to be condemned in a
[00:21:04.040 --> 00:21:09.360]   few minutes, and if you're interested in living, just make an orderly line and come and stand
[00:21:09.360 --> 00:21:11.000]   outside and I'll meet you in a couple minutes."
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:13.960]   And he just walks out.
[00:21:13.960 --> 00:21:20.040]   The way he has shared that message betrays the message.
[00:21:20.040 --> 00:21:22.400]   Because I don't think he believes it.
[00:21:22.400 --> 00:21:24.400]   And no one's going to follow him out.
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:29.060]   The message itself comes with a sense of urgency.
[00:21:29.060 --> 00:21:31.480]   And that's what Paul is saying in 2 Peter 1.3.
[00:21:31.480 --> 00:21:37.800]   He says, "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness."
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:41.240]   There's nothing more to wait for.
[00:21:41.240 --> 00:21:44.200]   Everything that we need has been completed.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:48.280]   That's why Jesus says, as he's hanging on the cross, "It is finished."
[00:21:48.280 --> 00:21:51.480]   He didn't say, "It's almost done."
[00:21:51.480 --> 00:21:54.080]   He didn't say, "I'm almost there."
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:58.520]   And if you just wait for a little bit, he says, "No, it is finished."
[00:21:58.520 --> 00:22:01.680]   Everything that the Jews were waiting for, for salvation, everything that was promised
[00:22:01.680 --> 00:22:05.260]   in the Old Testament, he says, "It is finished."
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:06.440]   And that's what Paul means.
[00:22:06.440 --> 00:22:10.040]   He says, "Kairos, we're here.
[00:22:10.040 --> 00:22:11.040]   We've been here."
[00:22:11.040 --> 00:22:16.640]   And the only reason why he didn't come back is so that the church could continue to preach
[00:22:16.640 --> 00:22:21.320]   the gospel with urgency, so that the gospel would go to the remotest part of the world.
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:27.520]   He's saying, "Kairos, this is that time, now."
[00:22:27.520 --> 00:22:34.360]   He goes on even further, and he says, in verse 11, he says, "That the hour has come."
[00:22:34.360 --> 00:22:36.040]   The hour.
[00:22:36.040 --> 00:22:40.880]   The word "hour" also means a point in time, but it is a lot more specific.
[00:22:40.880 --> 00:22:44.360]   And the word is "now."
[00:22:44.360 --> 00:22:51.040]   In fact, if you've ever studied through the book of Hebrews, Hebrews is written to second-generation
[00:22:51.040 --> 00:22:56.480]   Jewish Christians who are simply drifting back to their old life.
[00:22:56.480 --> 00:22:59.300]   They got tired of fighting.
[00:22:59.300 --> 00:23:05.320]   They got tired of fighting and going against the stream, so they just kind of let go.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:10.040]   And so the warning in the book of Hebrews is, how will you escape if you simply neglect
[00:23:10.040 --> 00:23:11.560]   this great salvation?
[00:23:11.560 --> 00:23:13.560]   And warning after warning after warning.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:14.560]   Do not neglect.
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:15.560]   Pay attention.
[00:23:15.560 --> 00:23:17.480]   Pay attention.
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:24.040]   And so the author repeats over and over again, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:25.040]   your heart."
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:26.040]   Hebrews 3, 7-8.
[00:23:26.040 --> 00:23:30.640]   "Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says, 'Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your
[00:23:30.640 --> 00:23:34.300]   hearts as in the rebellion.'"
[00:23:34.300 --> 00:23:38.840]   He calls the Jewish rebellion as simply hardening their heart.
[00:23:38.840 --> 00:23:43.960]   And the reason why God calls the nation of Israel and their sins "stiff neck" is that
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:47.040]   they were hard to mold.
[00:23:47.040 --> 00:23:51.080]   God would tell them one thing, and they would resist.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:56.720]   So he says, "Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart."
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:24:00.800]   The temptation that we have living in Orange County is that, and especially when we're
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:10.000]   young, we think we have a lot of time, which is not the case.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.160]   And you know it.
[00:24:12.160 --> 00:24:16.800]   We fool ourselves as saying that today, tomorrow is going to look the same because that's the
[00:24:16.800 --> 00:24:18.760]   way it's been for the last year or two.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:20.840]   It's been like that for the last decade.
[00:24:20.840 --> 00:24:24.840]   And we just automatically lull ourselves to sleep to think that that's the way it's always
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:25.840]   going to be.
[00:24:25.840 --> 00:24:29.440]   But scientifically, you know that's not true.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:33.680]   You know that we all die.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:35.980]   You know that the world at one point is going to die.
[00:24:35.980 --> 00:24:37.160]   We know the end is coming.
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:41.400]   We know that everything that we experience, that even though it may have been the same
[00:24:41.400 --> 00:24:45.440]   for the last 10, 20, or 30, or 40 years, we know the end is coming.
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:49.960]   That's a fact, Christian or non-Christian.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:56.520]   And yet, we convince ourselves that nothing's going to change because everything looks the
[00:24:56.520 --> 00:24:58.200]   same.
[00:24:58.200 --> 00:25:03.000]   And that's why the warning, he says, "Today, the reason why you hear the Word of God, and
[00:25:03.000 --> 00:25:08.280]   if you're convicted in any way, if the gospel message itself, it makes any sense to you,
[00:25:08.280 --> 00:25:12.680]   the scripture says it's the kindness of God that leads you to repentance.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:17.200]   The fact that you are even attracted to the Word of God, the fact that you hear the Word
[00:25:17.200 --> 00:25:23.920]   of God, and there's any part of you that desires to obey, the scripture says that is God's
[00:25:23.920 --> 00:25:25.480]   kindness in your life.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.620]   You didn't do that to yourself.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.240]   You didn't wake up one day and say, "You know what?
[00:25:29.240 --> 00:25:33.540]   I'm going to be a good person, and I'm going to open my ears to hear His Word."
[00:25:33.540 --> 00:25:35.460]   You didn't do that.
[00:25:35.460 --> 00:25:40.360]   The scripture says that it is God's kindness that this morning, as the Word of God is being
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:47.040]   taught, the only reason why you're even interested in listening to the Word of God is because
[00:25:47.040 --> 00:25:49.560]   God led you here.
[00:25:49.560 --> 00:25:54.680]   And so therefore, he says, "If you hear His Word today, do not harden your heart, because
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:59.080]   tomorrow it may not be here."
[00:25:59.080 --> 00:26:02.400]   Tomorrow you may have hardened your heart, and you will hear the same Word, and it no
[00:26:02.400 --> 00:26:05.520]   longer has the same effect on you.
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:10.880]   Tomorrow you'll be at the church, and you'll hear the same Word of God, and you're annoyed
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.400]   by it.
[00:26:13.400 --> 00:26:17.440]   That's why it says, Hebrews 3.15, "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart
[00:26:17.440 --> 00:26:19.600]   as in the rebellion."
[00:26:19.600 --> 00:26:25.000]   Hebrews 4.7, "Today, if you hear His voice, do not harden your heart."
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:31.680]   You see how he says not to harden your heart?
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:36.520]   We typically think, you know, hardening your heart just happens.
[00:26:36.520 --> 00:26:37.520]   It just happened.
[00:26:37.520 --> 00:26:38.520]   You know, it's just my heart.
[00:26:38.520 --> 00:26:39.520]   I don't know how I got here.
[00:26:39.520 --> 00:26:42.960]   But he says, "No, you did it.
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.200]   You do not harden your heart."
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:45.720]   Well, how did that happen?
[00:26:45.720 --> 00:26:50.080]   When did I make a decision to harden my heart?
[00:26:50.080 --> 00:26:53.440]   When you did not obey.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:54.640]   You didn't make a decision and say, "You know what?
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:55.640]   I'm going to harden my heart.
[00:26:55.640 --> 00:26:57.080]   I'm going to harden it and harden it and harden it."
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:26:58.080]   He says, "No."
[00:26:58.080 --> 00:27:01.880]   And that's why he commands them because you have a choice.
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:07.960]   When you hear your voice, hear His voice, whether to respond or to delay.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:13.480]   Is there a sense of urgency to this gospel message that we profess, that we sing, that
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:16.000]   we memorize, that we study?
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:21.320]   Because the very nature of this gospel requires absolute surrender.
[00:27:21.320 --> 00:27:27.220]   He says thirdly, "Salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed."
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:31.880]   Not only are we in the time of season, he says it is now, not tomorrow.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:35.520]   And then thirdly, "Salvation is nearer to us now than when we first believed."
[00:27:35.520 --> 00:27:40.720]   Didn't Jesus say the time or the hour of His coming that He did not know, that only the
[00:27:40.720 --> 00:27:42.780]   Father knows?
[00:27:42.780 --> 00:27:45.080]   So what does Paul mean here?
[00:27:45.080 --> 00:27:47.720]   Does Paul know something that Jesus didn't know?
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.480]   Is that what he's talking about?
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:53.000]   Clearly, that's not what he is saying.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.360]   He's saying to every Christian for every generation after the death and resurrection
[00:27:57.360 --> 00:28:02.120]   ascension of Jesus Christ, if you've been a Christian for three years, you are three
[00:28:02.120 --> 00:28:07.100]   years closer to meeting the Lord than when you first met Him.
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:10.400]   If you've only been a Christian for three days, you're three days closer to meeting
[00:28:10.400 --> 00:28:11.400]   Him.
[00:28:11.400 --> 00:28:16.000]   In other words, our days are limited.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.620]   Time is ticking.
[00:28:19.620 --> 00:28:26.360]   As non-Christians, it makes sense to live their lives as if they're going to be here.
[00:28:26.360 --> 00:28:29.040]   And at the end of your life, you can look back and you can look at your bucket list
[00:28:29.040 --> 00:28:32.040]   and say, "I did this and I did this and I did this."
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:35.500]   And then when you die, you say, "Well, at least I milked everything I could of this
[00:28:35.500 --> 00:28:36.880]   life before I left."
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:40.560]   I can understand why non-Christians would do that.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:47.440]   But as Christians, this is our preparation to invest long-term.
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:53.840]   That this life that we have, this bucket list that so many people have, at the end of our
[00:28:53.840 --> 00:28:59.120]   life, if we are true believers, we'll look at that bucket list and you'll say, "Vanity,
[00:28:59.120 --> 00:29:00.920]   vanity, all of vanity."
[00:29:00.920 --> 00:29:02.560]   But you can't take any of that.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:05.160]   It had nothing to do with where we're going.
[00:29:05.160 --> 00:29:11.800]   See, as Christians, it would only make sense that if we are preparing ourselves for eternity,
[00:29:11.800 --> 00:29:15.080]   that we would be packing our bags.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:18.960]   That we'd be measuring what's going to fit in this bag that we can take.
[00:29:18.960 --> 00:29:24.360]   Because the airplane that you're riding would only allow one bag, and so you are contemplating
[00:29:24.360 --> 00:29:29.200]   which to take and which to throw away, which to leave behind.
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:33.680]   So we would be spending a lot of time preparing for this travel.
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:34.680]   What's going to fit?
[00:29:34.680 --> 00:29:35.680]   What is worth taking?
[00:29:35.680 --> 00:29:36.680]   Do I need a hair dryer?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:37.680]   Do I need these shoes?
[00:29:37.680 --> 00:29:40.560]   And that's what we would be preparing for.
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:42.480]   We would be preparing for our departure.
[00:29:42.480 --> 00:29:47.720]   And as long as we are here, we're counting our days.
[00:29:47.720 --> 00:29:50.520]   We're counting our days until that day comes.
[00:29:50.520 --> 00:29:58.880]   See, that's the logical response, a reasonable response to the gospel that we profess.
[00:29:58.880 --> 00:30:07.280]   But to live our life like the rest of the world, it betrays our witness.
[00:30:07.280 --> 00:30:10.840]   It betrays the gospel message.
[00:30:10.840 --> 00:30:17.120]   It betrays the sense of urgency when our lives don't look any different than the world.
[00:30:17.120 --> 00:30:24.480]   To say, the building is burning down and there's only one exit that's going to save you, and
[00:30:24.480 --> 00:30:29.840]   then for us to live and to act like everybody else.
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:35.600]   As Christians, we've learned and we've adjusted our lives to accept that.
[00:30:35.600 --> 00:30:39.120]   But non-Christians see right through that hypocrisy.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:42.760]   They see right through that hypocrisy.
[00:30:42.760 --> 00:30:46.680]   Because I don't think you believe it.
[00:30:46.680 --> 00:30:52.200]   The thing that you are so desperate for me to believe, you believe it first.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:57.040]   See what Paul is saying here in Ephesians 5, 15-16, he says again, "Look carefully then
[00:30:57.040 --> 00:31:03.120]   how you walk, not as unwise but as wise, making the best use of the time because the days
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:05.560]   are evil."
[00:31:05.560 --> 00:31:10.880]   The word here for "make the best use" literally means to redeem.
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:12.480]   To redeem the time.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:15.240]   Not to simply spend the time.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:17.700]   Not to simply spend the money.
[00:31:17.700 --> 00:31:18.700]   But to redeem it.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:24.240]   Remember what Apostle Paul says, "If it was up to him, he's ready to go."
[00:31:24.240 --> 00:31:25.880]   We look at that, "Oh man, that's so challenging.
[00:31:25.880 --> 00:31:29.040]   Apostle Paul wanted to be with the Lord."
[00:31:29.040 --> 00:31:32.600]   That's reasonable.
[00:31:32.600 --> 00:31:37.640]   A man who met the Lord, who lost everything for the sake of Christ, I mean, it wouldn't
[00:31:37.640 --> 00:31:41.680]   make sense if Paul said, "I'm sitting in prison, I'm just afraid, like I don't want to be with
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:44.160]   the Lord, I'm not ready yet."
[00:31:44.160 --> 00:31:45.440]   That would contradict his life.
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:47.640]   That would contradict his message.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:54.560]   It would only make sense a man who truly met the Lord to say, "I'm ready to go."
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:57.600]   Because everything about his life was hard.
[00:31:57.600 --> 00:32:05.080]   But he says, "Knowing that my work is not done yet, and me staying means fruitful labor
[00:32:05.080 --> 00:32:11.080]   for me, that I get to preach more gospel, and more people to come to Christ, that I
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.080]   will stay."
[00:32:12.080 --> 00:32:16.340]   And that's the only reason why he would want to stay.
[00:32:16.340 --> 00:32:22.080]   And that is the only reason why any Christian would try to stay and live hard here.
[00:32:22.080 --> 00:32:31.120]   It is the only logical reason for any Christian to live their life with that purpose.
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:37.680]   Our lives, what we choose and what we don't choose, it betrays our message.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:42.400]   See, Paul is saying that we are closer now.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:44.080]   We're ready to go.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:48.440]   The time to meet the Lord, our salvation, glorification, is nearer now than we first
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.440]   believed.
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:56.240]   In other words, be ready, be prepared, pack your bags.
[00:32:56.240 --> 00:33:00.880]   Fourth and finally, he says, "The night is far gone, the day is at hand."
[00:33:00.880 --> 00:33:03.120]   The night is far gone, the day is at hand.
[00:33:03.120 --> 00:33:08.660]   And as you guys know, the scripture oftentimes uses the night to refer to darkness and sin,
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:12.680]   and the day to refer to light and righteousness.
[00:33:12.680 --> 00:33:15.920]   When I read that passage, it automatically triggers memories.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:23.240]   When I was younger and I was working the night shift at the gas station in Norwalk, 76, and
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:26.320]   we probably only had about three customers per night.
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:30.360]   And the only reason why they kept it open was because corporate office told them that
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.600]   they want to advertise, "We're a 24-hour gas station place."
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:40.760]   So they were hiring people, students like myself, and I worked from 11 p.m. to 6 a.m.
[00:33:40.760 --> 00:33:43.520]   And initially, I thought, "That's great, 11 to 6 a.m.
[00:33:43.520 --> 00:33:46.160]   I can go there and study."
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:50.600]   And I was going to school full-time, so I was working to pay for my school and pay for
[00:33:50.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   my bills.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:52.600]   And so it'd be great.
[00:33:52.600 --> 00:33:56.880]   And again, you have to remember, this is a period when internet was not invented yet.
[00:33:56.880 --> 00:33:58.640]   There was no cell phones.
[00:33:58.640 --> 00:34:03.320]   TVs usually turned off by about 1 or 2 a.m. at most.
[00:34:03.320 --> 00:34:09.040]   And whatever was on at 1 a.m. was complete trash, infomercial type of stuff.
[00:34:09.040 --> 00:34:10.600]   So there's nothing to do.
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:16.200]   So I remember reading the Book of Acts four times, just one night, literally just out
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:18.240]   of boredom.
[00:34:18.240 --> 00:34:24.200]   And I was doing small group discipleship, and my disciple would give me a book to read.
[00:34:24.200 --> 00:34:27.080]   And literally, I would show up next day, it's like, "Do you have something else?"
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:29.560]   Because I just finished.
[00:34:29.560 --> 00:34:31.880]   Because I had basically seven hours of doing nothing.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:37.080]   So initially, I thought it was great for a college student that I get to go there and
[00:34:37.080 --> 00:34:41.160]   study, but I realized that I'm not that sober at 1 a.m.
[00:34:41.160 --> 00:34:43.240]   I'm just trying to sleep.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:47.080]   So my mind wasn't alert enough to do that.
[00:34:47.080 --> 00:34:52.240]   And then there was no human interaction because there's no customers, and it wasn't at least
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:53.240]   where we were at.
[00:34:53.240 --> 00:34:54.600]   It wasn't necessarily a good neighborhood.
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:59.240]   So I was constantly concerned that the wrong crowd was going to show up.
[00:34:59.240 --> 00:35:00.240]   So it was miserable.
[00:35:00.240 --> 00:35:03.480]   So after about two months of this, I mean, it was torture.
[00:35:03.480 --> 00:35:08.720]   What I thought was a great idea, but it was torture because right around 1 o'clock, when
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:14.480]   all human activity stops, I'm just sitting in this booth, and there's no gum, there's
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:16.440]   no snacks, there's nothing in there.
[00:35:16.440 --> 00:35:19.160]   And the gas station was like, it was not like today where you had a.m. p.m.
[00:35:19.160 --> 00:35:22.520]   It was just cash register and buttons I push, and that's it.
[00:35:22.520 --> 00:35:25.360]   And I was sat there for seven hours every single day.
[00:35:25.360 --> 00:35:26.360]   You know?
[00:35:26.360 --> 00:35:29.960]   And then every time a human being would come and be like, "Yes!"
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   Some interaction.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:33.880]   So I remember after about two months, it was miserable.
[00:35:33.880 --> 00:35:38.920]   So about every day from 11 to 1, it would go fairly okay because there's some traffic,
[00:35:38.920 --> 00:35:45.440]   but 11, 1 to 6 was just looking at the clock, like 1101.
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:46.440]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:46.440 --> 00:35:48.240]   1102.
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:55.600]   And I just remember just sitting in the booth just five, six hours just doing nothing, and
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:36:02.480]   then every morning I would wait for that sunrise to come up because that sunrise meant people
[00:36:02.480 --> 00:36:03.480]   are waking up.
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.760]   There's going to be some traffic, and then I get to go home.
[00:36:07.760 --> 00:36:12.240]   And I did that job for about seven months, but that was so like deeply embedded in my
[00:36:12.240 --> 00:36:13.240]   head.
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:17.160]   Just every morning at 5 o'clock, just looking out.
[00:36:17.160 --> 00:36:22.560]   I was literally in this position for seven hours and just waiting for the sun to come
[00:36:22.560 --> 00:36:29.960]   up because that sun coming up meant life for me in that context.
[00:36:29.960 --> 00:36:33.840]   So whenever I read this, it reminds me of that time.
[00:36:33.840 --> 00:36:37.600]   Just sitting in darkness for that long and waiting for the sun to come up so that I can
[00:36:37.600 --> 00:36:38.600]   go home.
[00:36:38.600 --> 00:36:43.420]   See, that is exactly what Paul means.
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:46.240]   He said the night is not, it's going to go.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:49.240]   He said it's gone.
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:53.640]   Jesus didn't say I'm going to resurrect, he said he's resurrected.
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:58.560]   Everything that we need for life and godliness has happened.
[00:36:58.560 --> 00:37:00.280]   It's here.
[00:37:00.280 --> 00:37:03.320]   So in other words, what are we waiting for?
[00:37:03.320 --> 00:37:04.320]   What exactly are we waiting for?
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:06.560]   Are we waiting for our situation to change?
[00:37:06.560 --> 00:37:08.040]   Are we waiting for a small group?
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:09.520]   Are we waiting for older people to reach out?
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:11.180]   What are we waiting for?
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:16.200]   Everything that we need for life and godliness, he said the sun has come out.
[00:37:16.200 --> 00:37:17.520]   We're in the day.
[00:37:17.520 --> 00:37:19.680]   We're not waiting for the day to come.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:22.120]   We're not waiting for something to happen.
[00:37:22.120 --> 00:37:25.160]   He said it's here.
[00:37:25.160 --> 00:37:27.720]   It's here.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.900]   Everything that we need is here.
[00:37:31.900 --> 00:37:33.120]   To stop waiting.
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:35.200]   To live.
[00:37:35.200 --> 00:37:36.880]   To cling to God.
[00:37:36.880 --> 00:37:38.160]   To run to him.
[00:37:38.160 --> 00:37:40.600]   To share the gospel.
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.520]   What else are we involved in in life that has distracted us from the core message that
[00:37:46.520 --> 00:37:49.920]   we profess and sing every single week?
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:54.280]   Whatever it is, it is not from God.
[00:37:54.280 --> 00:37:57.080]   All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, the boastful
[00:37:57.080 --> 00:38:01.200]   pride of life, is not from the Father.
[00:38:01.200 --> 00:38:04.080]   None of that is from the Father.
[00:38:04.080 --> 00:38:11.760]   And so Paul, the reason why he pounds this time, because it is not enough to simply profess
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.160]   I believe that.
[00:38:13.160 --> 00:38:20.760]   It is not enough to come to church and just mentally consent and dabble here and dabble
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:23.200]   there.
[00:38:23.200 --> 00:38:28.600]   The message itself requires a response.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:34.400]   It requires a response today.
[00:38:34.400 --> 00:38:37.060]   Or else we can't pray.
[00:38:37.060 --> 00:38:39.200]   We won't be able to pray.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:42.040]   We can pretend to pray.
[00:38:42.040 --> 00:38:45.440]   We can say the words.
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:51.040]   We can gather together and share our hurts and our concerns.
[00:38:51.040 --> 00:38:58.600]   And we can soothe our brokenness with superficial band-aid.
[00:38:58.600 --> 00:39:04.480]   But there is no healing until you come to Christ.
[00:39:04.480 --> 00:39:09.360]   And you can't come to Christ if you don't pray.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:16.000]   And you can't pray if you have lost a sense of urgency.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.440]   We are lost without Jesus.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.160]   I don't care how much money you have.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.360]   I don't care how healthy you are.
[00:39:24.360 --> 00:39:27.080]   I don't care what kind of job promotion you got.
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:31.000]   I don't care how good your life looks.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:34.800]   There is no healing outside of Christ.
[00:39:34.800 --> 00:39:38.080]   There is no life outside of Christ.
[00:39:38.080 --> 00:39:41.360]   There is no refuge outside of Christ.
[00:39:41.360 --> 00:39:44.720]   There is no fruit outside of Christ.
[00:39:44.720 --> 00:39:47.840]   There is no fellowship outside of Christ.
[00:39:47.840 --> 00:39:51.180]   There is no light outside of Christ.
[00:39:51.180 --> 00:39:55.040]   There is no hope outside of Christ.
[00:39:55.040 --> 00:40:00.800]   And the only way that we can come to Him is by prayer.
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:04.200]   That's why Jesus came and died.
[00:40:04.200 --> 00:40:05.780]   That's why He came and died.
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:07.800]   Not so that you can be healthy.
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:11.840]   Not so that your children can have a good education.
[00:40:11.840 --> 00:40:17.880]   Not so that people who are lonely could have friends.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:20.320]   Life is in Christ.
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.040]   In Christ alone.
[00:40:24.040 --> 00:40:32.120]   And it isn't until that message grips our hearts and changes our lives can you say that
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:36.400]   you met Jesus Christ.
[00:40:36.400 --> 00:40:38.960]   These aren't just words.
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:45.480]   These are words of a man who gave his life preaching this.
[00:40:45.480 --> 00:40:51.040]   Surrounded by other men who had their heads chopped off.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:52.920]   Or burned at the stake.
[00:40:52.920 --> 00:40:55.480]   Driven from their homes.
[00:40:55.480 --> 00:40:57.880]   Loved ones leaving them.
[00:40:57.880 --> 00:41:02.200]   Left their homes and went to foreign countries.
[00:41:02.200 --> 00:41:07.520]   Because they found this treasure in Christ and they sold everything to make sure they
[00:41:07.520 --> 00:41:10.320]   had it.
[00:41:10.320 --> 00:41:17.080]   Until we come to recognize the preciousness of what it is that we have in Jesus, we will
[00:41:17.080 --> 00:41:20.320]   live the rest of our lives fooling ourselves.
[00:41:20.320 --> 00:41:24.400]   Playing games in the name of Jesus Christ.
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.240]   But never knowing Him.
[00:41:27.240 --> 00:41:32.360]   I pray that that is not the case with us.
[00:41:32.360 --> 00:41:37.120]   Jesus is real.
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.440]   He is real.
[00:41:40.440 --> 00:41:46.760]   I know we talk about it every week.
[00:41:46.760 --> 00:41:51.080]   Every week we say the same thing.
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:57.160]   But He's real.
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:03.480]   The Jesus I know was resurrected from the dead.
[00:42:03.480 --> 00:42:11.840]   And even now after all these years, He calls us, "Come to me.
[00:42:11.840 --> 00:42:16.840]   Come to me, all you who are weary and have been laden.
[00:42:16.840 --> 00:42:21.920]   Because rest is in Jesus, in Jesus alone."
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:27.120]   Pray with me.
[00:42:27.120 --> 00:42:38.800]   Let me lead us in prayer as our worship team.
[00:42:38.800 --> 00:42:45.720]   Heavenly Father, we're all tired of playing games.
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:53.480]   There's a disconnect with the songs that we sing and the lives that we live.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:43:00.200]   There is a disconnect with the theology that we profess and what has filled our hearts.
[00:43:00.200 --> 00:43:06.800]   Lord, we want you.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.920]   Not just words of you.
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.560]   Not just other people's testimonies.
[00:43:13.560 --> 00:43:17.400]   Not just things in history.
[00:43:17.400 --> 00:43:23.280]   Lord, bring revival.
[00:43:23.280 --> 00:43:26.480]   Drive your church, Father.
[00:43:26.480 --> 00:43:33.040]   You deserve worship, true worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:43:33.040 --> 00:43:37.480]   If we have become numb, break us.
[00:43:37.480 --> 00:43:43.580]   If we've been walking our lives, Lord God, nonchalantly, open our eyes to see the darkness
[00:43:43.580 --> 00:43:48.960]   that is around us, the desperation, Lord God, of the non-Christians who are like sheep without
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:55.360]   shepherds, we implore you, bring revival.
[00:43:55.360 --> 00:43:59.760]   We implore you even in this room, Father God, to break us from our sins, break us from our
[00:43:59.760 --> 00:44:02.800]   pride.
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.120]   Break us, Lord God, from complacency.
[00:44:07.120 --> 00:44:09.040]   You are our hope.
[00:44:09.040 --> 00:44:10.920]   Only you.
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:18.840]   Not our wives, not our husbands, not our children, not our bank account, not our friends, not
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.320]   our church.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:22.720]   Only you.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.440]   Please, Father, let us see that.
[00:44:27.440 --> 00:44:30.960]   Be convicted of that.
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:36.560]   Your children may come to you and live.
[00:44:36.560 --> 00:44:39.200]   Help us, Father God.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:41.040]   We believe.
[00:44:41.040 --> 00:44:42.040]   Help our unbelief.
[00:44:42.040 --> 00:44:44.760]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
