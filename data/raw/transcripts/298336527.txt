[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.960]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 16, I'll be reading
[00:00:07.960 --> 00:00:10.960]   from verse 17 through 20.
[00:00:10.960 --> 00:00:19.320]   I think I have maybe about three more messages including today, maybe.
[00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.040]   And then we're going to take a short break from the teaching and then we're going to
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.200]   be jumping most likely into the book of Hebrews.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:32.040]   So those of you who are A students and you want to get ahead and study, we're most likely
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   going to be in the book of Hebrews.
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.880]   Rest of you, that's where we're going, okay?
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.940]   Alright, verse 17, "Now I urge you, brethren, keep your eye on those who cause dissensions
[00:00:43.940 --> 00:00:48.880]   and hindrances contrary to the teaching which you learned and turn away from them.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.760]   For such men are slaves not of our Lord Christ but of their own appetites and by their smooth
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:57.520]   and flattering speech they deceive the hearts of the unsuspecting.
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:01:02.480]   For the report of your obedience has reached to all, therefore I am rejoicing over you.
[00:01:02.480 --> 00:01:05.880]   But I want you to be wise in what is good, innocent in what is evil.
[00:01:05.880 --> 00:01:09.000]   The God of peace will soon crush Satan under your feet.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.920]   The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you."
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:11.920]   Let's pray.
[00:01:11.920 --> 00:01:20.040]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you for such a great privilege that we have to be able
[00:01:20.040 --> 00:01:22.280]   to worship you.
[00:01:22.280 --> 00:01:27.340]   Help us, Lord, not to take for granted the access that we have to this throne of grace.
[00:01:27.340 --> 00:01:31.040]   Help us, Lord God, to be good stewards of everything that you've given.
[00:01:31.040 --> 00:01:36.800]   I pray for your mercies this morning, that your word would penetrate our hearts, our
[00:01:36.800 --> 00:01:41.280]   minds, and ultimately move our lives, Lord God, that we may become more and more like
[00:01:41.280 --> 00:01:43.140]   Christ every day.
[00:01:43.140 --> 00:01:48.280]   So anoint this time in your Holy Spirit, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:48.280 --> 00:01:52.720]   I know some of you guys are Dodger fans, and I was up at a retreat so I couldn't watch
[00:01:52.720 --> 00:01:54.080]   the game.
[00:01:54.080 --> 00:02:00.360]   And even though I don't normally follow Dodgers during the regular season, I hurt for you.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.440]   And my only encouragement is put your hope in Jesus, okay?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:07.760]   So some of you guys who didn't watch, you don't know what I'm talking about, but I'm
[00:02:07.760 --> 00:02:11.800]   sure it was a big heartache yesterday for those of you guys who were watching.
[00:02:11.800 --> 00:02:17.280]   You know, if you have small children, you probably, I mean, if they're of age, you probably
[00:02:17.280 --> 00:02:22.560]   have the kids play at least pony ball or some kind of sports when they're young.
[00:02:22.560 --> 00:02:27.400]   When they're at that young age, there is no real criteria for them to join a team, because
[00:02:27.400 --> 00:02:32.600]   the goal of those teams is to kind of get their feet wet, see if they have some athleticism,
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:33.600]   see if they like it.
[00:02:33.600 --> 00:02:38.400]   So even if they don't like it, even if they have no athleticism whatsoever, when you're
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:42.280]   three, four, five, six years old, it's just, you just send them in, you take pictures,
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.920]   and it's cute, right?
[00:02:43.920 --> 00:02:48.640]   And then, so they don't have a tryout, they just kind of try different positions.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:52.540]   But as they get older, the purpose of this team changes.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:58.520]   So somewhere around puberty, maybe around 11, 12, 13, it starts to get a little bit
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:00.360]   more competitive.
[00:03:00.360 --> 00:03:05.600]   So you see the good kids being separated into different teams, and then they start to play
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:07.840]   certain position, they go to the all-stars.
[00:03:07.840 --> 00:03:12.080]   By the time they're in high school, their sole purpose is to win.
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:14.100]   So if you're not good, you're not on the team.
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:18.280]   And even if you make the team, if you're not the top maybe, you know, nine, 10 players,
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:20.600]   you're not going to see much playing time.
[00:03:20.600 --> 00:03:25.760]   You're the guy that they use to warm up for the guys who are going to compete, right?
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:30.560]   Depending on what the purpose of the team is, the membership of that team changes.
[00:03:30.560 --> 00:03:34.440]   So in a competitive team, for the purpose of winning, you're going to have very strict
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:35.440]   membership.
[00:03:35.440 --> 00:03:38.240]   You're going to have people who are going to come in, who's going to add to the goal
[00:03:38.240 --> 00:03:39.940]   of the team.
[00:03:39.940 --> 00:03:46.560]   Now if you are talking about a neighborhood, a community, they don't have strict membership.
[00:03:46.560 --> 00:03:48.240]   In fact, it's illegal.
[00:03:48.240 --> 00:03:50.680]   You can't discriminate who comes in and who comes out.
[00:03:50.680 --> 00:03:55.200]   I mean, again, we live in a great country where those kind of laws exist, and so you
[00:03:55.200 --> 00:04:00.800]   can't discriminate based upon age or sex or, you know, religion or anything like that,
[00:04:00.800 --> 00:04:06.160]   because the purpose of that community is to have anybody welcome.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:11.420]   The question is, what is the church?
[00:04:11.420 --> 00:04:16.400]   So some people may look at it as a community, and the fact that we have even membership
[00:04:16.400 --> 00:04:20.720]   maybe bother you because why should we put any kind of borders?
[00:04:20.720 --> 00:04:21.720]   Everybody should be welcome.
[00:04:21.720 --> 00:04:26.440]   The idea of having any kind of borders in the church maybe sounds unchristian to you
[00:04:26.440 --> 00:04:30.880]   because your mentality is this is a community like our neighborhood.
[00:04:30.880 --> 00:04:34.520]   And then you have the other extreme where it's kind of competitive sports team where
[00:04:34.520 --> 00:04:37.800]   this is only a gathering of elites.
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:43.200]   We want the green berets, people who are elite and there's no tolerance for anybody who can't
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:46.020]   do their part, and then they usually get weeded out.
[00:04:46.020 --> 00:04:51.040]   So you have a church filled with people who only are doing this, and there's no tolerance
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:52.720]   for any weakness in the church.
[00:04:52.720 --> 00:04:54.640]   And eventually, again, they get weeded out.
[00:04:54.640 --> 00:04:56.280]   So which is the church?
[00:04:56.280 --> 00:04:58.980]   What does the Bible describe?
[00:04:58.980 --> 00:05:06.640]   The Bible describes the church as a community of people gathered for a specific purpose.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.580]   So it is both.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:13.480]   It is both a community where God gathers together both the weak and the strong from various
[00:05:13.480 --> 00:05:19.200]   backgrounds, where we practice grace, accept the strong and the weak, encourage those who
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:26.640]   are weak-hearted, but for the specific purpose of being a light into this world.
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.120]   It is not just a community of people who gather together where we just accept one another
[00:05:31.120 --> 00:05:32.120]   no matter what.
[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:33.600]   There is a specific vision.
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:37.520]   There's a specific task that God has called us to.
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:43.760]   And that's what Paul was trying to say to the Roman church after 15 chapters of preaching
[00:05:43.760 --> 00:05:44.760]   the gospel.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:49.960]   He's exhorting them to protect this gospel, to make sure that in the church that you do
[00:05:49.960 --> 00:05:55.120]   not allow these wolves to come in and destroy what God's trying to build.
[00:05:55.120 --> 00:06:01.200]   So last week we looked at Paul telling them to watch, to be sober.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:05.400]   Watch to make sure that you don't allow these false teachers to come into the church.
[00:06:05.400 --> 00:06:09.400]   So this week we're going to be looking at the second part where he says, "Once you recognize
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:11.960]   them to separate."
[00:06:11.960 --> 00:06:16.120]   And then third, make sure that you are discerning.
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:23.480]   So the second part, when he says to separate, the idea of separating or not to be around
[00:06:23.480 --> 00:06:30.920]   them or the exact words that he uses, to turn away, it almost sounds unchristian.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:35.680]   If you've grown up in a context where all you've heard was, "God is gracious no matter
[00:06:35.680 --> 00:06:41.720]   what you do," and that's exclusively the only thing that you heard, it seems unchristian
[00:06:41.720 --> 00:06:44.160]   to think that we would draw any boundaries.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:48.960]   We would be patient and tolerant of everything and everyone.
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:55.480]   But again, the community of the body of Christ is also a body of Christ, the army of God,
[00:06:55.480 --> 00:06:59.300]   the temple of God, for a specific purpose.
[00:06:59.300 --> 00:07:00.840]   So it is not one over the other.
[00:07:00.840 --> 00:07:06.520]   So therefore, Paul says, "Once you've identified them, make sure that you draw lines and you
[00:07:06.520 --> 00:07:12.240]   don't allow them to penetrate into the church."
[00:07:12.240 --> 00:07:20.440]   Many people think that if we preach the Bible too much or if we get too deep into theology,
[00:07:20.440 --> 00:07:22.240]   that's naturally going to divide the church.
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:28.080]   So let's not talk about what theology we believe.
[00:07:28.080 --> 00:07:31.120]   Don't talk about baptism, don't talk about various outside things.
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:34.940]   Just talk about the essential of the gospel, which basically is, "Jesus loves you and died
[00:07:34.940 --> 00:07:36.440]   for you on the cross."
[00:07:36.440 --> 00:07:41.780]   And as long as we talk about that, the church wouldn't be united.
[00:07:41.780 --> 00:07:47.080]   But the problem with that is that that will also unite the non-Christians.
[00:07:47.080 --> 00:07:52.160]   Because I've never met a non-Christian who is offended by a gospel that teaches that
[00:07:52.160 --> 00:07:54.520]   he loves you.
[00:07:54.520 --> 00:07:56.360]   I've never met a Christian who said, "You know what?
[00:07:56.360 --> 00:08:00.080]   How dare you say that your God loves me?"
[00:08:00.080 --> 00:08:04.960]   If we take what unites us to the lowest common denominator, where even the non-Christians
[00:08:04.960 --> 00:08:08.760]   can walk in, we lose the identity of what it means to be a Christian.
[00:08:08.760 --> 00:08:11.720]   In fact, I found it exactly the opposite.
[00:08:11.720 --> 00:08:16.940]   The more we pay attention to Scripture, the more unity I find.
[00:08:16.940 --> 00:08:22.000]   Apostle Paul says in Ephesians 4, 11-14, he gave some as apostles, some as prophets,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.720]   some as evangelists, and some as pastors, and some as teachers, for the equipping of
[00:08:25.720 --> 00:08:28.820]   the saints for the work of service to the building up of the body of Christ.
[00:08:28.820 --> 00:08:35.140]   You notice how he highlights apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, but he
[00:08:35.140 --> 00:08:38.460]   doesn't talk about the gift of administration.
[00:08:38.460 --> 00:08:42.300]   He doesn't talk about the gift of hospitality.
[00:08:42.300 --> 00:08:46.500]   There's a unifying factor of all of these offices.
[00:08:46.500 --> 00:08:49.860]   Can you guess what they are?
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:56.500]   Every single one of these offices, their primary task was to teach the Word of God.
[00:08:56.500 --> 00:09:02.580]   The apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, to teach the Word of God, the
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:06.420]   church may be equipped for the building up of the body of Christ, until what?
[00:09:06.420 --> 00:09:08.860]   Until we all attain the unity of the faith.
[00:09:08.860 --> 00:09:13.260]   He doesn't say, "Stay away from too deep teaching of the Word of God, or else we're
[00:09:13.260 --> 00:09:14.260]   not going to be united."
[00:09:14.260 --> 00:09:20.300]   He says the way that we get united is to pay attention to what he says in his Word.
[00:09:20.300 --> 00:09:21.960]   That's how we get united.
[00:09:21.960 --> 00:09:25.940]   And of the knowledge of the Son of God, to a mature man, to the measure of the stature
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.140]   of which belongs the fullness of Christ.
[00:09:28.140 --> 00:09:33.860]   As a result, we are no longer to be children tossed here and there by waves carried about
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:40.460]   by every wind of doctrine, by the trickery of man, by craftiness and deceitful scheming.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:44.140]   He says these men who are going to come in to pervert the gospel, they're going to cause
[00:09:44.140 --> 00:09:45.460]   divisions in the church.
[00:09:45.460 --> 00:09:50.300]   So he says watch for them, and then he says to break away from them.
[00:09:50.300 --> 00:09:56.220]   Because not only will they divide the church, they will cause hindrances to the gospel of
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.220]   Christ.
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:10:02.820]   The word hindrance literally means, is scandalon, where we get the word scandal.
[00:10:02.820 --> 00:10:06.620]   And the idea is that it will trap you.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:10.700]   If you allow these false teachers to come in, and you're not paying attention, you're
[00:10:10.700 --> 00:10:15.780]   not sober, you can easily be swayed back and forth by every wind of doctrine that comes
[00:10:15.780 --> 00:10:17.420]   in.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:24.140]   That's why he says, God says in Exodus 34, 12, "Watch yourself that you make no covenant
[00:10:24.140 --> 00:10:29.100]   with the inhabitants of the land into which you are going, or it will become a snare or
[00:10:29.100 --> 00:10:32.180]   a trap in your midst."
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:36.740]   He says if you marry a Canaanite woman, she's also going to bring with her the gods that
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.420]   she served before she married you.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:45.620]   And then once she comes in, and you allow that idol to come into the camp of Israel,
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:49.380]   that family is going to end up corrupting the other families, and eventually it's going
[00:10:49.380 --> 00:10:52.300]   to lead the nation of Israel astray.
[00:10:52.300 --> 00:10:54.540]   That's the same language that Paul is using.
[00:10:54.540 --> 00:11:01.780]   Once you identify these false teaching, make sure, he says, to turn away from them.
[00:11:01.780 --> 00:11:03.380]   Now why is this so significant?
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:10.020]   And even if you belong to a Bible teaching church, why do we need to stay sober?
[00:11:10.020 --> 00:11:14.380]   You know, I was raised in a Presbyterian home.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:18.180]   I got saved at a charismatic para-church.
[00:11:18.180 --> 00:11:23.220]   I went to a conservative Bible teaching, Biola, Talbot.
[00:11:23.220 --> 00:11:27.720]   I got discipled by Navigator-style discipleship.
[00:11:27.720 --> 00:11:34.860]   And then I, you know, who was also charismatic, and then I became, I went to a Baptist church,
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:37.140]   and then I became Reformed.
[00:11:37.140 --> 00:11:38.620]   So I kind of went full circle.
[00:11:38.620 --> 00:11:43.660]   But in the midst of all of this, in the past 30-some years that I've been a Christian,
[00:11:43.660 --> 00:11:48.380]   I've seen so many movements come in and go out.
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:51.900]   And every wind of doctrine that comes in, there is some truth to it, but there's also
[00:11:51.900 --> 00:11:53.660]   a danger that it brings.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:58.120]   Just in the time that I've been a Christian, I got saved in 1983 at the tail end of the
[00:11:58.120 --> 00:12:03.160]   Jesus movement, and that Jesus movement primarily was one way.
[00:12:03.160 --> 00:12:07.520]   There's only one way, Jesus Christ, and then these hippies that the traditional churches
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:09.100]   would not accept.
[00:12:09.100 --> 00:12:10.100]   So we're going to get rid of all that.
[00:12:10.100 --> 00:12:14.080]   And that's when the dress code started changing, you know, and they started to become a bit
[00:12:14.080 --> 00:12:17.040]   more casual to win the hippies to the church.
[00:12:17.040 --> 00:12:21.600]   And the primary message of that time was, "One saved always saved."
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:25.340]   And there was bumper stickers that would say, "Christians are not perfect, just forgiven."
[00:12:25.340 --> 00:12:28.260]   And that was the mantra of that time.
[00:12:28.260 --> 00:12:33.460]   The tail end of that movement, it created this fuzziness in the church where there wasn't
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:36.500]   any guidelines, there wasn't any discipleship.
[00:12:36.500 --> 00:12:40.260]   Everybody was claiming assurance of salvation while living in sin, and then the holiness
[00:12:40.260 --> 00:12:41.260]   movement came in.
[00:12:41.260 --> 00:12:42.260]   So discipleship.
[00:12:42.260 --> 00:12:44.140]   So every church was about being discipled.
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:48.460]   This happened at the, maybe in the mid-80s to tail end of the 80s.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:54.340]   And at the end of that, at the end of that movement came the charismatic movement.
[00:12:54.340 --> 00:12:59.780]   The charismatic movement came because this holiness movement felt dry.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:02.900]   You know, everybody was being disciplined and reading the Bible and doing all this,
[00:13:02.900 --> 00:13:05.380]   and they said, "No, it's about the spirit."
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:09.740]   And so when the charismatic movement came in, all of a sudden the worship began to change.
[00:13:09.740 --> 00:13:14.980]   So I remember early on as a Christian, you know, I would lead praises with one guitar,
[00:13:14.980 --> 00:13:17.140]   and at that time it was considered contemporary.
[00:13:17.140 --> 00:13:18.140]   Right?
[00:13:18.140 --> 00:13:22.540]   One guitar, because prior to that it was piano, it was pipe organs, and it had to be very
[00:13:22.540 --> 00:13:24.300]   high church.
[00:13:24.300 --> 00:13:28.580]   And all of a sudden we started leading praise with guitars, and then all of a sudden even
[00:13:28.580 --> 00:13:32.140]   the Presbyterian churches started to have a praise team.
[00:13:32.140 --> 00:13:34.420]   You know, guitar, electric band, the drums, and all this.
[00:13:34.420 --> 00:13:37.380]   This all came in as a result of the charismatic movement.
[00:13:37.380 --> 00:13:42.780]   And now, you know, most churches usually have praise teams like what we see here.
[00:13:42.780 --> 00:13:47.580]   Well, at the end of the charismatic movement, people were saying, "Well, it's charismatic,
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:49.260]   it's kind of chaotic."
[00:13:49.260 --> 00:13:50.260]   You know?
[00:13:50.260 --> 00:13:54.380]   And so they were starting to, people got tired of it, and then young people were starting
[00:13:54.380 --> 00:13:56.000]   to leave the church.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.020]   And so there was this panic, if this continues, that we're going to lose a young generation,
[00:14:01.020 --> 00:14:02.660]   next generation we're not going to have any Christians.
[00:14:02.660 --> 00:14:05.900]   And all of a sudden this seeker-friendly movement came in.
[00:14:05.900 --> 00:14:10.740]   And the seeker-friendly movement was, let's get these young people back to church.
[00:14:10.740 --> 00:14:14.980]   So they started running the adult service like they would Sunday school.
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:18.340]   They would have programs, they would have skits, and they would have big shows up in
[00:14:18.340 --> 00:14:22.500]   the front to attract the adults to come, and it attracted a lot of people.
[00:14:22.500 --> 00:14:28.940]   Prior to the seeker-friendly movement, a mega church would have been a church maybe 5,000
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:30.060]   or 6,000.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:34.400]   There weren't churches that had 10,000, 20,000, 40,000 people, not in the United States.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.260]   All of a sudden the seeker-friendly churches started gathering people, and the mega churches,
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:43.540]   10,000, 20,000, 30,000 churches started popping up, which to this day they exist.
[00:14:43.540 --> 00:14:48.180]   Well at the tail end of the seeker-friendly movement, people got tired of the superficialness,
[00:14:48.180 --> 00:14:52.180]   where this is all happening up on the stage, we need some meat.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:55.420]   And then came the Bible movement.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:15:01.020]   And this probably happened maybe in the early 2000, 2003, 2004.
[00:15:01.020 --> 00:15:05.220]   And all of a sudden Bible-teaching churches started to grow, and our churches was one
[00:15:05.220 --> 00:15:06.420]   of them.
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:09.340]   People were hungry for meat.
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:15.680]   So they were coming to church wanting to have discipleship, the teaching of God's Word.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.060]   And then at the tail end of that, people were like, you know, church discipline, it's about
[00:15:21.060 --> 00:15:22.960]   theology, it's about the Word.
[00:15:22.960 --> 00:15:26.180]   And then the Gospel Center movement swept in.
[00:15:26.180 --> 00:15:27.640]   It's not just about the Word.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:30.240]   We need to focus on Jesus and the Gospel.
[00:15:30.240 --> 00:15:32.420]   And then that started to sweep the church.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:36.340]   So I've seen these movements just in the short time that I've been a Christian, back and
[00:15:36.340 --> 00:15:37.540]   forth, back and forth.
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.040]   Now in every one of these movements, there is truth.
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.740]   Because they see an error and they're trying to fix it.
[00:15:44.740 --> 00:15:48.220]   But the problem with that is whenever this thing swings, it has a tendency to swing all
[00:15:48.220 --> 00:15:50.060]   the way to the left.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:53.700]   And it goes back and forth and back and forth.
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:16:00.020]   Now the danger of following the trends of the waves that come back and forth, back and
[00:16:00.020 --> 00:16:05.700]   forth, eventually, if you follow the trend, the trend may, and oftentimes does, lead you
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:08.500]   away from who God is.
[00:16:08.500 --> 00:16:15.740]   If your spiritual life is dependent upon the majority of people's opinions, you will always
[00:16:15.740 --> 00:16:19.860]   be dependent upon whatever movement comes into town.
[00:16:19.860 --> 00:16:23.740]   And that's why he says to pay attention to the Word of God.
[00:16:23.740 --> 00:16:27.980]   Because every lie has some truth in it.
[00:16:27.980 --> 00:16:30.740]   And that's why it's called deception.
[00:16:30.740 --> 00:16:33.180]   That's why he says to pay very close attention.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:39.140]   You know, I mentioned to you years ago that I spent about a year sitting down with two
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:46.060]   missionaries to UCI, two young men who were in their mid-20s, and full-time devoted to
[00:16:46.060 --> 00:16:52.300]   share the gospel from the local church, Witness Lees.
[00:16:52.300 --> 00:16:56.500]   And so I sat down with them, spent months, every Wednesday, sitting down talking with
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:17:01.140]   them, and I remember sitting down in the beginning, and I said, "Oh, you guys are from the Witness
[00:17:01.140 --> 00:17:02.140]   Lee Church?"
[00:17:02.140 --> 00:17:05.060]   And they said, "Oh, don't call us Witness Lee.
[00:17:05.060 --> 00:17:06.060]   We're the local church."
[00:17:06.060 --> 00:17:09.340]   And I said, "Well, don't you guys study from Witness Lee?"
[00:17:09.340 --> 00:17:12.420]   They said, "No, we study the Bible."
[00:17:12.420 --> 00:17:13.900]   And I said, "Oh, okay.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:18.700]   Well when you studied this Bible, do you use Bible study material?"
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:21.220]   And he said, "Yeah."
[00:17:21.220 --> 00:17:23.700]   "So this Bible study material, who wrote it?"
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.900]   I said, "Witness Lee."
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.740]   "So do you use any other Bible study material other than Witness Lee?"
[00:17:29.740 --> 00:17:31.580]   And then he knew where I was getting at.
[00:17:31.580 --> 00:17:33.940]   He's like, "No."
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:37.780]   So basically everything you're being taught is being taught through Witness Lee's Bible
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:38.780]   study material.
[00:17:38.780 --> 00:17:44.660]   And he's like, "Well, yeah, but we're studying the Bible."
[00:17:44.660 --> 00:17:48.700]   Now here's the danger in all of that, and we can get into that same trap.
[00:17:48.700 --> 00:17:53.820]   We can get to the Bible through people and through theology and through books and never
[00:17:53.820 --> 00:17:57.480]   really understand the scripture itself.
[00:17:57.480 --> 00:18:02.580]   And there's a danger in that, because when that man falls, you fall with him.
[00:18:02.580 --> 00:18:11.140]   If your primary confidence is in a system, if it's in a man, if it's in your camp, when
[00:18:11.140 --> 00:18:14.380]   that camp goes astray, so do you.
[00:18:14.380 --> 00:18:20.500]   That's why he gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, pastors, and teachers, so that you may be
[00:18:20.500 --> 00:18:23.420]   unified by the Word.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.220]   Not by our denomination, not by our tradition, not by the masses, not by whatever wind of
[00:18:28.220 --> 00:18:36.900]   doctrine may be popular at the time that we are in, but by the solid and unchanging Word
[00:18:36.900 --> 00:18:37.900]   of God.
[00:18:37.900 --> 00:18:41.940]   I know so many people who are so versed in theology, but know nothing about the passage
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:43.700]   itself.
[00:18:43.700 --> 00:18:47.900]   Even when people quote theology to me, and I fully agree, my first question is, "How
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:49.940]   did you get there?
[00:18:49.940 --> 00:18:53.260]   What passages led you to do that, to believe that?"
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.740]   And if they can't defend their theology, it is not valid.
[00:18:56.740 --> 00:19:02.940]   I don't care how many high theologians you quote, because you didn't get there.
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:06.140]   Somebody put you on a boat and took you there.
[00:19:06.140 --> 00:19:07.700]   So it's not based upon God's Word.
[00:19:07.700 --> 00:19:09.740]   Your confidence is in somebody.
[00:19:09.740 --> 00:19:12.100]   Your confidence is in a church.
[00:19:12.100 --> 00:19:14.700]   Your confidence is in your denomination.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:18.780]   But it's not in His Word.
[00:19:18.780 --> 00:19:24.500]   In order for us to recognize right and wrong doctrine, we have to be men and women in the
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:25.500]   Word.
[00:19:25.500 --> 00:19:28.620]   That's why he says to watch, be sober, and then when you recognize that, to separate.
[00:19:28.620 --> 00:19:34.180]   Titus 3, 9-11, "But avoid foolish controversy, genealogy, strife, disputes about the law,
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.220]   for they are unprofitable and worthless.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:38.580]   Reject a factious man.
[00:19:38.580 --> 00:19:43.780]   Consider first and second warning, knowing that such a man is perverted and is sinning,
[00:19:43.780 --> 00:19:46.420]   being self-condemned."
[00:19:46.420 --> 00:19:49.880]   He said the reason why these people are coming in and doing these things is because they
[00:19:49.880 --> 00:19:53.300]   are motivated by their own appetite.
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.700]   They're not seeking the glory of God.
[00:19:54.700 --> 00:19:56.820]   They're not seeking truth.
[00:19:56.820 --> 00:19:59.100]   But they are men who are enslaved to their own appetites.
[00:19:59.100 --> 00:20:04.300]   Romans 6, 18, "For such men are slaves, not of our Lord Jesus Christ, but of their own
[00:20:04.300 --> 00:20:06.660]   appetite."
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.300]   Paul makes it very clear in Romans chapter 6 and Romans chapter 7, the distinction between
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:17.300]   a Christian and a non-Christian is that a Christian has been delivered from slave to
[00:20:17.300 --> 00:20:22.100]   sin and he's become a slave to righteousness.
[00:20:22.100 --> 00:20:27.180]   So he's not describing a Christian who has some difference of opinions.
[00:20:27.180 --> 00:20:33.340]   He's describing a person whose appetite has never changed.
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:37.020]   That's exactly how Jonathan Edwards describes a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:38.780]   What is true and what is not true.
[00:20:38.780 --> 00:20:45.440]   Because a Christian, when he meets Christ, his appetite changes.
[00:20:45.440 --> 00:20:50.460]   We see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ and all of a sudden we want him rather than
[00:20:50.460 --> 00:20:51.460]   the world.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.060]   See, a false teacher says he is led by his own appetite.
[00:20:56.060 --> 00:21:01.140]   In Philippians 3, 18-19, "For many walk of whom I often told you and now tell you even
[00:21:01.140 --> 00:21:06.460]   weeping that they are enemies of the cross of Christ, whose end is destruction, whose
[00:21:06.460 --> 00:21:11.500]   God is their appetite, and whose glory is in their shame, who set their minds on earthly
[00:21:11.500 --> 00:21:14.020]   things."
[00:21:14.020 --> 00:21:19.540]   A non-Christian is an individual where his appetite has never changed.
[00:21:19.540 --> 00:21:25.500]   All that has changed is he added God to whatever they were pursuing before they met Christ
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:31.700]   and so their frustration is, "How come God is not helping me with my life?"
[00:21:31.700 --> 00:21:33.960]   He still has his ambition.
[00:21:33.960 --> 00:21:39.800]   He still wants to be somebody in this fallen world and he's never let go of the pursuit
[00:21:39.800 --> 00:21:42.180]   of his own comfort and glory.
[00:21:42.180 --> 00:21:45.180]   So his appetite has never changed.
[00:21:45.180 --> 00:21:50.700]   So therefore, even in his teaching, he is willing to teach false doctrine for the purpose
[00:21:50.700 --> 00:21:52.180]   of satisfying his own appetite.
[00:21:52.180 --> 00:21:55.620]   Now, his appetite is not just talking about food.
[00:21:55.620 --> 00:21:58.060]   He's talking about his flesh.
[00:21:58.060 --> 00:22:03.780]   His primary reason is because he wants to satisfy his flesh, whether that is money,
[00:22:03.780 --> 00:22:07.740]   whether that is comfort, whether that's glory, or whether it is food.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:13.140]   Whatever it may be, he is a man who is led by his flesh.
[00:22:13.140 --> 00:22:18.660]   A Christian may be struggling and at times being tempted by the appetite that he had
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:25.780]   before he met Christ, but fundamentally, Jonathan Edwards writes religious affection because
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:31.220]   people were questioning the revival, that this was or was not really from God.
[00:22:31.220 --> 00:22:36.700]   So he writes this book, Religious Affection, and at the core of what he says is, a true
[00:22:36.700 --> 00:22:43.060]   Christian is one where his affections have been changed for Christ.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:47.980]   He saw who he is and he saw what he has done and then now he's attracted to that more
[00:22:47.980 --> 00:22:48.980]   than the world.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:53.020]   He said, "These men who come in, they're preaching the false doctrine.
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.220]   They're motivated by their own flesh."
[00:22:55.220 --> 00:22:56.820]   He says, "Watch out for them.
[00:22:56.820 --> 00:22:57.820]   Separate from them."
[00:22:57.820 --> 00:23:00.820]   He says, "These people come in and they use flattery."
[00:23:00.820 --> 00:23:06.580]   And the word for flattery is eulogia, where we get the word eulogy.
[00:23:06.580 --> 00:23:12.740]   Typically, when you hear a eulogy, you never hear something negative in a eulogy.
[00:23:12.740 --> 00:23:17.300]   And the word eulogia literally means good speech.
[00:23:17.300 --> 00:23:22.540]   So when you go to a funeral, it may not be a lie, but they highlight the best part of
[00:23:22.540 --> 00:23:26.100]   that person, whatever that may be.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:28.020]   He was a good golfer.
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:29.700]   He was very generous.
[00:23:29.700 --> 00:23:31.340]   He was a good dad.
[00:23:31.340 --> 00:23:33.820]   Whatever it was, they highlight.
[00:23:33.820 --> 00:23:37.860]   He may have been a horrible friend.
[00:23:37.860 --> 00:23:40.020]   He may have been lousy with his money.
[00:23:40.020 --> 00:23:41.740]   He may have been neglecting his children.
[00:23:41.740 --> 00:23:46.900]   Whatever it may be, in a eulogy, you only hear what is good.
[00:23:46.900 --> 00:23:51.700]   And that's what Paul uses here to describe a false teacher, that he comes in his whole
[00:23:51.700 --> 00:23:55.420]   purpose for his self-benefit.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:23:57.940]   He says things that people want to hear.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:01.660]   That's exactly what 2 Timothy 4, 2-4.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.380]   He says to Timothy, "You preach the word.
[00:24:03.380 --> 00:24:05.900]   Be ready in season and out of season.
[00:24:05.900 --> 00:24:11.180]   Reprove, rebuke, exhort with great patience and instruction."
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:12.860]   You notice that?
[00:24:12.860 --> 00:24:13.860]   Reprove?
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:14.860]   Rebuke?
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:20.820]   There are some circles where the word "rebuke," you get a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.780]   People are having a hard time as it is with life.
[00:24:23.780 --> 00:24:25.780]   You don't want to come to church and get rebuked.
[00:24:25.780 --> 00:24:32.060]   See, if you're building a community like a neighborhood where everyone is accepted, and
[00:24:32.060 --> 00:24:36.220]   that's your sole purpose, then the word "rebuke" shouldn't fit.
[00:24:36.220 --> 00:24:39.100]   It should be encouraging all the time.
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:47.260]   But he says, "You rebuke, reprove, exhort with great patience and instruction."
[00:24:47.260 --> 00:24:56.220]   If your life, if all it is, is sitting around watching Netflix, you don't want anybody uppity.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:24:58.220]   You want to keep it quiet.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:00.460]   You don't need a cheerleader in the room.
[00:25:00.460 --> 00:25:05.260]   But if you're in a competition to win something, like the way Paul describes our Christian
[00:25:05.260 --> 00:25:09.940]   life, like if you're in a World Series, you know, you're in game seven, and your outfielder
[00:25:09.940 --> 00:25:16.680]   is standing in the wrong spot, and the coach sees that and says nothing, that's a bad coach.
[00:25:16.680 --> 00:25:21.560]   And if the fellow teammates watches him, and he's not paying attention, he's fraternizing
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:25.340]   with the stand, and they're about to hit, and he's not even paying attention, and nobody
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:33.300]   says anything to that guy, that's a bad team, depending on what the community is for.
[00:25:33.300 --> 00:25:36.720]   So if you're building a community where everybody just kind of gets along, and there is no purpose
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:43.100]   behind it other than just having an easy life, then yes, the word "rebuke" doesn't fit Christianity.
[00:25:43.100 --> 00:25:46.660]   But if the church is what he says it is, the temple of God, it is the army of God, the
[00:25:46.660 --> 00:25:57.600]   body of Christ, it is a community for the purpose of carrying out his great commission.
[00:25:57.600 --> 00:26:01.300]   He says, "For the time will come when they will not endure sound doctrine, but wanting
[00:26:01.300 --> 00:26:06.140]   to have their ears tickled, they will accumulate for themselves teachers in accordance to their
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:08.340]   own desires."
[00:26:08.340 --> 00:26:13.620]   Their ears tickled, meaning they have an itch in their ear that they can't reach, and the
[00:26:13.620 --> 00:26:18.580]   guy with the eulogy comes, and basically he gives good word, right?
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:19.580]   He's going to scratch.
[00:26:19.580 --> 00:26:24.740]   So every week they come, and they scratch your ears, "Oh, that felt good."
[00:26:24.740 --> 00:26:27.780]   And that's how sermons and teachings are evaluated.
[00:26:27.780 --> 00:26:29.140]   "Did that feel good?
[00:26:29.140 --> 00:26:30.700]   Did I feel encouraged?
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.420]   Did I feel uplifted?"
[00:26:33.420 --> 00:26:36.060]   Kind of like YouTube.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:38.500]   "I like it."
[00:26:38.500 --> 00:26:41.180]   "I didn't like it."
[00:26:41.180 --> 00:26:43.980]   "I got my ears scratched.
[00:26:43.980 --> 00:26:44.980]   Oh, that felt good.
[00:26:44.980 --> 00:26:47.020]   Oh, it didn't feel good."
[00:26:47.020 --> 00:26:51.260]   He says, "There's going to come a time when people are not pursuing Christ, so if they're
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.100]   not in the context of this marathon, they don't want a cheerleader, they don't want
[00:26:56.100 --> 00:26:59.700]   a coach, they just want somebody to kind of stay calm so that I can continue to do my
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   business."
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:07.460]   But Paul, or the author of Hebrews in chapter 4.12, describes the Word of God as living
[00:27:07.460 --> 00:27:12.380]   and active, sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:27:12.380 --> 00:27:18.120]   You ever see somebody scratch their ears with a double-edged sword?
[00:27:18.120 --> 00:27:20.180]   That's how the Bible describes the Word.
[00:27:20.180 --> 00:27:21.180]   You don't say, "Oh, I have an itch."
[00:27:21.180 --> 00:27:24.380]   It's like, you know?
[00:27:24.380 --> 00:27:28.300]   We think he's crazy, because you don't scratch your ear with a sharp object.
[00:27:28.300 --> 00:27:29.300]   You're going to get hurt.
[00:27:29.300 --> 00:27:31.100]   But that's how the Bible describes the Word of God.
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:34.180]   You ever see somebody scratch their ears with a hammer?
[00:27:34.180 --> 00:27:35.780]   Because that's another way the Bible describes it.
[00:27:35.780 --> 00:27:36.780]   It's like a hammer.
[00:27:36.780 --> 00:27:38.700]   You don't take a hammer to scratch your ear.
[00:27:38.700 --> 00:27:40.740]   Do you scratch your ear with fire?
[00:27:40.740 --> 00:27:43.180]   Because that's the way the Bible describes it.
[00:27:43.180 --> 00:27:45.100]   It's a fire and hammer of God.
[00:27:45.100 --> 00:27:51.780]   He says, "So an individual who's coming to scratch your ear is not preaching the Word,
[00:27:51.780 --> 00:27:55.460]   because the Word of God is sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:27:55.460 --> 00:28:03.940]   It is able to divide between soul and spirit and bone and marrow, and it judges the thoughts
[00:28:03.940 --> 00:28:05.140]   and intentions of a heart."
[00:28:05.140 --> 00:28:10.500]   Compare what he says here about this false prophet coming scratching your ear versus
[00:28:10.500 --> 00:28:13.100]   what Peter does.
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:18.260]   When he begins to preach the Word of God, he says, "You crucified that Messiah that we've
[00:28:18.260 --> 00:28:19.660]   been waiting for."
[00:28:19.660 --> 00:28:20.660]   And remember what happened?
[00:28:20.660 --> 00:28:24.020]   They were cut to the heart.
[00:28:24.020 --> 00:28:28.660]   If what you say is true, woe is us.
[00:28:28.660 --> 00:28:31.180]   We're going to be standing before this judge.
[00:28:31.180 --> 00:28:32.180]   What do we do?
[00:28:32.180 --> 00:28:36.980]   So, after Paul's preaching the truth, they were cut to the heart, and they say, "What
[00:28:36.980 --> 00:28:37.980]   do we do?"
[00:28:37.980 --> 00:28:42.140]   And Paul said, "Repent and be baptized."
[00:28:42.140 --> 00:28:43.140]   Look at Paul's preaching.
[00:28:43.140 --> 00:28:48.220]   When he preaches the Word of God, he immediately divides the believers and the unbelievers.
[00:28:48.220 --> 00:28:52.420]   They hear his Word, and those who believe, they are divided.
[00:28:52.420 --> 00:28:56.100]   They judge the thoughts and intentions of their heart, and then when they receive the
[00:28:56.100 --> 00:29:02.020]   truth, they either repent or they pick up their rocks and want to stone him, because
[00:29:02.020 --> 00:29:06.500]   he's bringing the hammer, he's bringing the fire, he's bringing the sword.
[00:29:06.500 --> 00:29:08.140]   He's not tickling their ears.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:11.780]   And that's exactly how the Bible describes God's Word.
[00:29:11.780 --> 00:29:18.180]   So next time you see somebody, his primary desire is to give good word, you know.
[00:29:18.180 --> 00:29:20.980]   And I'm not saying that the Word of God can't be encouraging.
[00:29:20.980 --> 00:29:25.660]   I'm not saying that the only time, you know, when the Bible is open is to rebuke you, there
[00:29:25.660 --> 00:29:28.060]   is encouragement.
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:33.420]   But see, a eulogy is only good words, only encouragement.
[00:29:33.420 --> 00:29:35.620]   He says to watch out for them, because they're going to be flattering.
[00:29:35.620 --> 00:29:39.140]   In other words, they're going to be using their flattery, and they're going to always
[00:29:39.140 --> 00:29:44.300]   kind of keep you calm, keep you encouraged, and keep the status quo, all for the purpose
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:48.820]   of feeding their own appetite and their own ego.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:54.860]   But if you are running in this race, you want the truth.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.780]   You want the truth.
[00:29:57.780 --> 00:30:00.420]   You don't want just Bengay, right?
[00:30:00.420 --> 00:30:02.540]   "I'm aching here.
[00:30:02.540 --> 00:30:03.540]   Rub it over here.
[00:30:03.540 --> 00:30:04.540]   I got an itch here.
[00:30:04.540 --> 00:30:07.380]   Itch over here."
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:12.700]   I remember when, you know, we had our first child, you know, and, you know, like you take
[00:30:12.700 --> 00:30:18.500]   Lamaze class, and they teach you to do breathing exercises and stuff.
[00:30:18.500 --> 00:30:22.860]   You know, when you're actually in the heat of the moment, and your wife is pushing, and
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:27.940]   all of that goes out the window, because, mainly because, you don't want to get killed,
[00:30:27.940 --> 00:30:28.940]   right?
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:36.420]   So if you, your wife is in intense pain, and you're like, "Listen, pay attention, breathe."
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:41.340]   It just doesn't seem like the right time to calm her down, you know?
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:45.620]   So you learn all that, and it's beneficial, because they kind of guide you through.
[00:30:45.620 --> 00:30:52.020]   And I remember when Esther was giving birth, she pushed over two hours and maybe 20 minutes.
[00:30:52.020 --> 00:30:56.980]   And I remember just thinking, like, "Every woman does this?"
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:31:00.180]   And she was so exhausted, and I couldn't tell her to do more.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:04.780]   In fact, I wanted to tell the doctors, like, "This can't be normal," right?
[00:31:04.780 --> 00:31:09.140]   And then, everybody got fatigued, Esther was just kind of passed out, and then I went to
[00:31:09.140 --> 00:31:12.740]   the nurse and said, "Hey, she's been pushing for two hours and 15 minutes, is this normal?"
[00:31:12.740 --> 00:31:17.500]   And she's like, "Oh, shoot, our goal is two hours," so they weren't paying attention,
[00:31:17.500 --> 00:31:18.980]   and they went a little bit over.
[00:31:18.980 --> 00:31:23.660]   And all of a sudden, this new nurse comes into the room, and Esther just passed out
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:25.980]   exhausted, and I didn't know what to do.
[00:31:25.980 --> 00:31:31.700]   She comes in, the first thing she says, "Esther!"
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:33.820]   And I remember thinking, "Where did this lady come from?
[00:31:33.820 --> 00:31:35.660]   Where was the other nurse?"
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:40.820]   And she started barking at her, you know, and said, "Pay attention!"
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.100]   Like, "Shut up!
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:44.980]   You're going to have to push!"
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   And she's barking at her, and Esther perks up, and she started pushing the whole time,
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:51.940]   I'm on the side, I'm like, "Man, this lady's mean.
[00:31:51.940 --> 00:31:53.900]   Why is she in this field?"
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:56.100]   You know?
[00:31:56.100 --> 00:31:59.180]   And she kind of let her through it, and eventually, she ended up pushing the baby out, and the
[00:31:59.180 --> 00:32:05.540]   whole time, I was thinking, like, "Man, who hired this lady?"
[00:32:05.540 --> 00:32:09.940]   After the delivery was done, you know, everybody took, and we had the baby all washed up, and
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:13.740]   then we're, like, calm in the room, I came in, and I asked Esther, I said, "Esther, man,
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:15.180]   that lady was mean!"
[00:32:15.180 --> 00:32:21.420]   And then she said, "Oh, my God, I couldn't have done it if she didn't, she wasn't there."
[00:32:21.420 --> 00:32:27.080]   And she told me her yelling at her gave her the strength to push.
[00:32:27.080 --> 00:32:30.380]   And then later on, I found out it's very strategic.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:37.700]   They appoint that person.
[00:32:37.700 --> 00:32:46.780]   They find the toughest lady during that time to get in the room and not to be nice, to
[00:32:46.780 --> 00:32:50.620]   get the attention, and so that, because they need the energy to push through, because they're
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:51.620]   so exhausted.
[00:32:51.620 --> 00:32:55.380]   And I found out it was very strategic.
[00:32:55.380 --> 00:33:01.220]   If you are relaxing and watching TV, and you just want to coast along, you don't want to
[00:33:01.220 --> 00:33:02.780]   coach.
[00:33:02.780 --> 00:33:04.860]   You don't want to be pushed.
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:07.420]   You don't want to be directed.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:12.220]   But if you're in the race, in the middle of a competition, you're exhausted and tired,
[00:33:12.220 --> 00:33:17.280]   the Word of God says it's a hammer, it's like a double-edged sword, it cuts through.
[00:33:17.280 --> 00:33:20.420]   It judges the thoughts and intentions of our heart, it gives us that boost to be able to
[00:33:20.420 --> 00:33:21.420]   continue.
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:27.020]   See, the false prophet comes in, and all he is teaching you is peace.
[00:33:27.020 --> 00:33:31.500]   He's giving you good word, scratching your ear, and it's not for your benefit.
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:33.940]   It's to satisfy his own ego.
[00:33:33.940 --> 00:33:37.800]   It says it is effective on hearts that are unsuspecting or not alert.
[00:33:37.800 --> 00:33:44.020]   The word there for unsuspecting is akakos, and basically it just means without bad.
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:50.220]   So, I mean, literally, the word doesn't mean that, I mean, it doesn't seem that bad, right?
[00:33:50.220 --> 00:33:52.420]   It's effective.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:59.460]   His false teaching, scratching ears, for his own appetite, he can easily win over those
[00:33:59.460 --> 00:34:02.140]   who are unsuspecting.
[00:34:02.140 --> 00:34:09.940]   What he is describing is an individual who is neither committed to good or bad.
[00:34:09.940 --> 00:34:11.980]   He's easily influenced.
[00:34:11.980 --> 00:34:13.900]   He's not paying attention.
[00:34:13.900 --> 00:34:18.500]   He's a guy or girl who is easily tossed back and forth in whatever trend that comes into
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:19.500]   town.
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:21.620]   So, if it's a charismatic movement, I'm a charismatic.
[00:34:21.620 --> 00:34:23.540]   If it is a holiness movement, I'm holiness.
[00:34:23.540 --> 00:34:25.780]   If it is the theology movement, I'm theology.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:27.780]   If it is the seeker-friendly, I'm seeker-friendly.
[00:34:27.780 --> 00:34:30.280]   If it is discipleship, it's discipleship.
[00:34:30.280 --> 00:34:35.420]   He's being tossed around back and forth, and in any group of people, you have some people
[00:34:35.420 --> 00:34:39.700]   who are leading, trying to shepherd the church into the right direction toward God, and then
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:45.240]   you may have some people who are just constantly negative and always dividing, and they tend
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:47.900]   to influence people as well.
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:52.580]   He's talking about a large group of people in the middle who are easily influenced back
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:56.860]   and forth because they're not paying attention.
[00:34:56.860 --> 00:35:01.700]   And whoever speaks the strongest, whoever is the most charismatic, whoever seems to
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.660]   have the most influence, whoever is the most articulate, those are the people that we give
[00:35:06.660 --> 00:35:08.180]   adherence to.
[00:35:08.180 --> 00:35:12.860]   He's talking about those people who are simple-minded, who are like children tossed back and forth.
[00:35:12.860 --> 00:35:15.000]   They do not know the Word of God.
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:18.660]   And so 1 Corinthians 15, 29 says, "Do not be deceived.
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:22.820]   Bad company corrupts good morals."
[00:35:22.820 --> 00:35:25.720]   That's why he says to protect the flock.
[00:35:25.720 --> 00:35:30.020]   That's why he says, "Do not be unequally yoked."
[00:35:30.020 --> 00:35:33.460]   And let me make this very clear, and the Scripture is not ambiguous about this.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:38.100]   A Christian and a non-Christian cannot be married.
[00:35:38.100 --> 00:35:44.100]   Just the idea that a Christian would even entertain that already means that that person
[00:35:44.100 --> 00:35:50.040]   has no idea what it means to be a Christian, or he's not a Christian at all.
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:54.700]   Because a Christian isn't somebody who comes to church on Sunday.
[00:35:54.700 --> 00:35:59.100]   A Christian's value has completely been transformed.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:04.500]   The way you raise your children, what you do with your money, what you do on the weekend,
[00:36:04.500 --> 00:36:08.740]   how you value people, where you live, it affects everything that we do.
[00:36:08.740 --> 00:36:13.980]   So how do you get unequally yoked with somebody where the Bible describes his whole intention
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:18.580]   is to satisfy his own appetite, who serves a different master, and then to be tied with
[00:36:18.580 --> 00:36:19.580]   that person?
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:25.500]   It is not possible, unless you're not a real Christian.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:27.960]   The Bible's very clear about that.
[00:36:27.960 --> 00:36:32.540]   And that's why he says the church must be a place, a gathering first and foremost, of
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:33.540]   believers.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:34.820]   That's why we have membership in the church.
[00:36:34.820 --> 00:36:39.980]   We welcome everybody into the church, but the church that God sees as church are believers
[00:36:39.980 --> 00:36:43.760]   who confess Christ as Lord and Savior.
[00:36:43.760 --> 00:36:48.420]   He says they come in and said, "Identify them."
[00:36:48.420 --> 00:36:52.620]   He says, "If you see that these people are here for the purpose of destroying the church,
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.340]   to put a snare," he said, "separate from them."
[00:36:55.340 --> 00:36:59.380]   And then verse 19, "Be discerning.
[00:36:59.380 --> 00:37:02.980]   For the report of your obedience has reached to all, therefore I am rejoicing over you,
[00:37:02.980 --> 00:37:09.580]   but I want you to be wise in what is good, and innocent in what is evil."
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:14.900]   From time to time, I hear this ridiculous opinion from some, and even sometimes from
[00:37:14.900 --> 00:37:23.000]   pastors, that it's okay to indulge in semi-pornographic material because you want to know what the
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:25.880]   world is like.
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:29.640]   You want to experience being drunk because you want to know that this is what the world
[00:37:29.640 --> 00:37:35.160]   struggles with, and it's okay for you to indulge in it a little bit because it benefits you
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:38.320]   being a good witness so that you can know what they're struggling with.
[00:37:38.320 --> 00:37:40.740]   This is what the world is like.
[00:37:40.740 --> 00:37:44.820]   Absolute garbage.
[00:37:44.820 --> 00:37:48.060]   Absolute garbage.
[00:37:48.060 --> 00:37:52.660]   It is directly contradictory to what Jesus says in Matthew 10, 16, "Behold, I send you
[00:37:52.660 --> 00:37:58.220]   out as sheep in the midst of the wolves, so be shrewd as serpents and as innocent as doves."
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.140]   When it comes to evil, he says, "Be innocent."
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:05.780]   He doesn't say dabble in it, touch it, view it, participate in it so that you can know.
[00:38:05.780 --> 00:38:08.500]   He says, "No, be innocent in it.
[00:38:08.500 --> 00:38:13.940]   Be shrewd like serpents, but be innocent when it comes to evil."
[00:38:13.940 --> 00:38:22.020]   Many people live their lives being innocent like serpents and shrewd like doves.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.940]   Foolishness.
[00:38:24.940 --> 00:38:27.280]   Our obedience must be discerning.
[00:38:27.280 --> 00:38:28.280]   Is it scriptural?
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:29.740]   Is it biblical?
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.500]   His final encouragement to them in Romans 16, 20, "The God of peace will soon crush
[00:38:33.500 --> 00:38:35.660]   Satan under your feet.
[00:38:35.660 --> 00:38:38.500]   The grace of our Lord Jesus be with you."
[00:38:38.500 --> 00:38:43.900]   Now is Paul talking about how if you continue to endure and do these things that you're
[00:38:43.900 --> 00:38:47.860]   going to be delivered from the persecution of the Romans?
[00:38:47.860 --> 00:38:54.300]   Because as you know, as we talked about, I think it was last week, that chapter 16 is
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:39:00.100]   the list of probably the first martyrs of the Roman church where the persecution happens.
[00:39:00.100 --> 00:39:05.980]   The intense persecution happens around 64, 65 AD because Nero was blaming the Christians
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:08.380]   for Rome burning down.
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:12.440]   And so all the movies and pictures you see of Christians being dragged into the Colosseum,
[00:39:12.440 --> 00:39:15.180]   it happened with the Roman Christians first.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:16.860]   Apostle Paul and everybody connected with him.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:22.180]   So this list of believers in chapter 16 was most likely the first martyrs of the Roman
[00:39:22.180 --> 00:39:23.180]   church.
[00:39:23.180 --> 00:39:28.620]   Then what does Paul mean when he says that Satan's head is going to be crushed under
[00:39:28.620 --> 00:39:31.580]   your feet?
[00:39:31.580 --> 00:39:37.380]   It's directly connected to the promise that God made to mankind in Genesis chapter 3.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:41.820]   He says that the seed of the woman is going to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:39:41.820 --> 00:39:45.540]   He wasn't talking about living a comfortable life.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:51.260]   He wasn't talking about a life devoid of any persecution or difficulty.
[00:39:51.260 --> 00:39:57.060]   He was talking about the ultimate victory that Christ was going to fulfill on the cross.
[00:39:57.060 --> 00:40:01.780]   And what you and I have a taste of because we know him now, but the ultimate victory
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:07.580]   is going to come when Christ comes and he crushes Satan's head permanently.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:14.180]   Because the recipients of this letter, humanly speaking, got tortured.
[00:40:14.180 --> 00:40:15.180]   They were beheaded.
[00:40:15.180 --> 00:40:18.700]   They were torn apart by lions.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:22.140]   Their life was miserable because they met Christ.
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:27.380]   But their eternity was in glory because Christ crushed the head of Satan.
[00:40:27.380 --> 00:40:30.380]   That's the promise that he gives the church.
[00:40:30.380 --> 00:40:35.580]   If we live our life thinking that our life and our hope is in this world, the younger
[00:40:35.580 --> 00:40:38.500]   you are the better.
[00:40:38.500 --> 00:40:39.500]   Because you have more life in you.
[00:40:39.500 --> 00:40:40.980]   You have more hope in you.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:45.980]   And a lot of times, especially where we live, we celebrate youth.
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:47.140]   We envy youth.
[00:40:47.140 --> 00:40:51.820]   We spend billions of dollars trying to be younger.
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:57.100]   But if our paradigm has shifted, if we are living biblically and pursuing the things
[00:40:57.100 --> 00:40:59.460]   of Christ, you should envy me.
[00:40:59.460 --> 00:41:03.820]   You should envy the older people.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:08.060]   Because there's more difficulty for you.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.580]   Just because we're a little bit ahead.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:11.660]   We're closer to glory.
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.660]   I'm talking about average.
[00:41:14.660 --> 00:41:16.220]   I can easily die tomorrow.
[00:41:16.220 --> 00:41:17.500]   You can easily die tomorrow.
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:21.140]   But just on the average.
[00:41:21.140 --> 00:41:26.820]   He is talking about glory that is coming with the coming of Christ.
[00:41:26.820 --> 00:41:30.660]   And how that changes everything.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:35.740]   If your paradigm is if you suffer now, tomorrow there is payoff.
[00:41:35.740 --> 00:41:39.740]   Tomorrow when the payoff doesn't come, you leave.
[00:41:39.740 --> 00:41:44.060]   If I put in the hard work, if I sacrifice, if I am disciplined, then tomorrow, maybe
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:48.820]   next year, maybe next decade, but when the payoff doesn't come, if that's what payoff
[00:41:48.820 --> 00:41:53.860]   is for you, and then you get disappointed, and then you get frustrated, and then after
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:59.060]   a while your faith begins to erode, and then eventually you leave.
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:02.860]   But the hope of the cross is not in this world.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.260]   While we are in this world, the Bible says we will suffer.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.700]   Because we are in enemy territory.
[00:42:08.700 --> 00:42:15.100]   We have wolves that are constantly trying to divide us, devour us.
[00:42:15.100 --> 00:42:20.780]   We have our enemy who is prowling around like a hungry lion seeking someone to devour, and
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:21.820]   that person is you.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:26.260]   And anyone who wants to run toward Christ, they become a greater target.
[00:42:26.260 --> 00:42:30.380]   And I've heard so many times young Christians who really start to devote their lives to
[00:42:30.380 --> 00:42:33.180]   Christ and all of a sudden they begin to have financial problems.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:34.660]   They begin to have problems at home.
[00:42:34.660 --> 00:42:38.020]   They start having problems with their workers.
[00:42:38.020 --> 00:42:39.660]   And I was perfectly fine.
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:43.860]   It's almost like they're being targeted.
[00:42:43.860 --> 00:42:50.300]   But the hope that we have in Christ, the promise that he gives, soon Satan's head will be crushed.
[00:42:50.300 --> 00:42:54.180]   He's talking about the eternal state of these Christians.
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:43:02.020]   No matter how hard and difficult life gets here in our struggle, our hope is our death.
[00:43:02.020 --> 00:43:04.780]   When we die, we will be in glory.
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:10.540]   Not only, not for ten years, not for sixty years, not for seventy years, but for eternity.
[00:43:10.540 --> 00:43:12.220]   So that's what changes us.
[00:43:12.220 --> 00:43:13.660]   That's the paradigm.
[00:43:13.660 --> 00:43:18.820]   That's the distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:43:18.820 --> 00:43:20.740]   So let me conclude with this.
[00:43:20.740 --> 00:43:25.260]   The hope and the promise that we have in Hebrews 10.36-39.
[00:43:25.260 --> 00:43:30.580]   For you have need of endurance, so that when you have done the will of God, you may receive
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:32.420]   what was promised.
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:38.980]   For yet in a very little while, he who is coming will come and will not delay.
[00:43:38.980 --> 00:43:44.500]   But my righteous one shall live by faith, and if he shrinks back, my soul has no pleasure
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:45.500]   in him.
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:50.580]   But we are not of those who shrink back to destruction, but of those who have faith to
[00:43:50.580 --> 00:43:53.820]   the persevering of the soul.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.580]   Let's pray.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:05.340]   Again, as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to come before the Lord in
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:06.340]   confession.
[00:44:06.340 --> 00:44:13.820]   I believe, help my unbelief, strengthen us, help us to be sober, help us not to simply
[00:44:13.820 --> 00:44:18.660]   want our ears tickled, but want the truth, even if it cuts at times, that we will be
[00:44:18.660 --> 00:44:24.620]   men and women that are firmly planted in his Word.
[00:44:24.620 --> 00:44:26.060]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
