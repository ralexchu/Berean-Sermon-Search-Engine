[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   Revelation chapter 1 verses 1 through 8. Today is the introduction of the book of Revelation.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:20.400]   And those of you guys who have done inductive Bible study through any part of the Bible,
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:26.440]   can you lower the volume a little bit? Ah, okay. If you have done any inductive Bible
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:33.120]   study through any book of the Bible, you'll know that the introduction has quite a few
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:36.320]   things that are hidden in there that if you do a little bit of research, you'll find out
[00:00:36.320 --> 00:00:40.920]   that it kind of points to the introduction and what to look for the rest of the book.
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:46.680]   And Revelation especially. Because as you're going in, you're going to, obviously, you
[00:00:46.680 --> 00:00:50.360]   know, we're expecting to get lost in some of these passages. So we're going to get in
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:53.600]   there and we're going to be asking about the color of the different horses and different
[00:00:53.600 --> 00:00:58.560]   trumpets and the bowls and what do they mean. So it's extremely important for us to understand
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:03.580]   the big picture. Because if you at least don't have the big picture, when you get confused
[00:01:03.580 --> 00:01:07.720]   with the details, then you're really going to be lost. Okay, so the introduction is extremely
[00:01:07.720 --> 00:01:17.600]   important. Let me pray first and then we'll jump in. Gracious and loving Father, we thank
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:24.640]   you so much for this evening. And we pray Father God that as we study through your Word,
[00:01:24.640 --> 00:01:29.600]   the things that you've revealed Father so many years ago, and so many people have dove
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:34.920]   into this book trying to understand the application, what it means. We pray Father God that you
[00:01:34.920 --> 00:01:40.240]   give us diligence that we would not just passively be listeners, but actively digging through
[00:01:40.240 --> 00:01:46.240]   your Word to understand your Revelation, why it was revealed and what you desire of us,
[00:01:46.240 --> 00:01:52.120]   Lord God, for those who are studying. We pray that the introductory statements, Lord, would
[00:01:52.120 --> 00:01:57.040]   make a lot of sense to us and give us things, Lord, that would help us point to the things,
[00:01:57.040 --> 00:02:03.080]   Lord, that the future studies would be able to be better understood because of it. So
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.680]   we pray that you would help us in Jesus' name we pray, Amen. All right, so if you look at
[00:02:07.680 --> 00:02:13.720]   the beginning of the letter in Revelations chapter 1 verses 1 through 8, there's obviously
[00:02:13.720 --> 00:02:19.320]   two sections and hopefully you had enough time to look at it before you came. Again,
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:25.400]   any study, and I'm going to say this again, probably as often as I can, any study that
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:30.080]   you're going to, you're really trying to glean from, if you just come in passively to listen,
[00:02:30.080 --> 00:02:34.120]   I guarantee you, you're going to obviously get less. The more you put in, the more you're
[00:02:34.120 --> 00:02:38.320]   going to get out of it. Book of Revelation, I told you this in Isaiah. Isaiah, if you
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:42.440]   just kind of casually come in, a lot of that stuff is going to go over your head. You already
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:46.400]   know that Revelation is not a book that you can just read casually. You can't just kind
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:50.280]   of flip through one page and say, okay, I get the gist of it. You really have to wrestle
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:55.960]   through what he was saying, where it's headed, in what context of history is he talking about,
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:03:01.920]   or else it's just going to sound like red horse, white horse, you know, black horse,
[00:03:01.920 --> 00:03:06.120]   and death and life, and that's basically all you're going to get, right? So I really want
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:12.080]   to encourage you. I'm giving you those questions as a pointer, so there's kind of a highlight,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:17.200]   but I really want to encourage you to go in there and dig. Dig verse 1, 2, 3, 4, and ask
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:22.720]   the right questions, because this book was not meant to be just skimmed over, right?
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:26.880]   And I don't think any book was meant to be skimmed over, but this book in particular,
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:31.920]   he wrote it and revealed to it in such a way that those who are diligently seeking, and
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:37.620]   searching, and asking, they will find the answers, right? And those who are just casually,
[00:03:37.620 --> 00:03:41.520]   it's almost kind of hidden. It's kind of like the reason why Jesus spoke in parables. He
[00:03:41.520 --> 00:03:46.360]   said for those who have ears so that they can listen, and ask, and search, they will
[00:03:46.360 --> 00:03:50.400]   have to go the extra step to find out what the meaning of the parable was. And he said
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:55.040]   those are given so that revelation may be given to you so you would have a deeper understanding
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:59.720]   of it. But those people were just casually listening. It's actually hidden to them, right?
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:04.760]   In Revelation, the apocryphal writing is exactly like that, right? If you casually listen,
[00:04:04.760 --> 00:04:08.360]   I guarantee you that it will go over your head. So again, this is my encouragement to
[00:04:08.360 --> 00:04:14.400]   you to really dive into this book. And some of the greatest treasures in the Scripture
[00:04:14.400 --> 00:04:19.140]   are things that are at least superficially hard to understand. But when you actually
[00:04:19.140 --> 00:04:23.160]   see what's revealed in it, you're going to find that this will help you to connect a
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.320]   lot of other parts of the Bible that you may not, you had maybe had a vague understanding
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:31.400]   of. Okay? All right. So we're going to look at the prologue. The very beginning, it starts
[00:04:31.400 --> 00:04:37.920]   with the revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave to show his servants the things that
[00:04:37.920 --> 00:04:41.920]   must soon take place. He made it known by sending his angel to his servant John. We're
[00:04:41.920 --> 00:04:47.360]   going to get a little bit deep into that. But the first part of it, everybody have your
[00:04:47.360 --> 00:04:56.460]   outline, right? Okay. When he says the revelation of Jesus Christ, right? Does this mean the
[00:04:56.460 --> 00:05:10.220]   revelation about Jesus Christ or revelation coming through Jesus Christ? I just want you
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:16.660]   to think. I'm not expecting any answers. I usually don't expect any answers. Right? Is
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.260]   it revelation of Jesus Christ, about Jesus Christ, or is it saying revelation through
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:31.940]   Jesus Christ? If you read the commentaries, there's, you know, there's pages written on
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:37.180]   why they think it is about Jesus Christ and why they think it is through Jesus Christ.
[00:05:37.180 --> 00:05:43.700]   But I don't think it necessarily has to be one or the other. The broad outline of the
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.940]   introduction is going to be about the revelation of Jesus Christ, about Jesus Christ, and revelation
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:55.500]   that is obviously coming through Jesus Christ. Jesus is the author, ultimately the author
[00:05:55.500 --> 00:06:01.340]   through the Holy Spirit. So if you look at the first few verses, it will give us a brief
[00:06:01.340 --> 00:06:10.100]   outline of how the revelation came to us. The order of the revelation that we see first,
[00:06:10.100 --> 00:06:23.940]   not to Christ, right? Revelation came from God to Christ. I think I got another. Okay.
[00:06:23.940 --> 00:06:40.900]   It's not there. It's actually here. All right. In a few seconds, it'll come up. Okay. I want
[00:06:40.900 --> 00:06:45.700]   to read a passage in Amos 3, 7 through 8. It says, "For the Lord God does nothing without
[00:06:45.700 --> 00:06:50.460]   revealing his secret to his servants, the prophets. The lion has roared. Who will not
[00:06:50.460 --> 00:06:58.060]   fear the Lord God has spoken? Who can prophesy?" So in Amos and all the other prophets, God
[00:06:58.060 --> 00:07:04.220]   says, before he does anything, he makes sure that revelation is first given. So the book
[00:07:04.220 --> 00:07:11.060]   of Revelation basically was not meant for it to be hidden. Right? So a lot of people
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:16.700]   think like, oh, the book of Revelation, he kind of wrote it in code so we won't understand.
[00:07:16.700 --> 00:07:20.660]   That was not the intention at all. In fact, from the very get-go, it says, this was a
[00:07:20.660 --> 00:07:26.020]   revelation. God is intending for us to know what he is saying. But he said it in a way
[00:07:26.020 --> 00:07:33.780]   where it requires work, it requires seeking him out. Right? So the order of what we see
[00:07:33.780 --> 00:07:41.620]   in the revelation is that God revealed through his son Christ. Christ reveals through the
[00:07:41.620 --> 00:07:49.340]   angels and then angels reveals through John. And then in the end, John reveals to the seven
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:58.980]   churches. So you can say, in a sense, that God is speaking through these various channels.
[00:07:58.980 --> 00:08:06.440]   And this is the typical way that God speaks. Again, in certain circles, or maybe even us,
[00:08:06.440 --> 00:08:11.740]   we will sometimes say, God told me this, God told me that. But the usual, it doesn't mean
[00:08:11.740 --> 00:08:16.900]   that God can't do that, or that God doesn't do that. But the typical way that God reveals
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:21.980]   himself is usually through his servants. And here he clearly spells out that it is through
[00:08:21.980 --> 00:08:28.180]   Christ, Christ through the angels, angels to John, and then John to the seven churches.
[00:08:28.180 --> 00:08:31.620]   So one of the questions that I want you guys to contemplate and think about, and I think
[00:08:31.620 --> 00:08:35.900]   it's one of the discussion questions, why does God not reveal all of this directly to
[00:08:35.900 --> 00:08:43.680]   us? Why does he go through Christ? Why the work of the Holy Spirit? Is the Holy Spirit
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:48.580]   only able to do something that God cannot do? And that's why he hires him or gets him
[00:08:48.580 --> 00:08:52.580]   to do that? Is the Holy Spirit not able to speak to all of us? I mean, the Holy Spirit
[00:08:52.580 --> 00:08:58.140]   is also omnipresent. Why does he use these channels to reveal these important things
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:03.720]   to us? I'm not going to answer that. I want you guys to think about it. Because this is
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.380]   the typical way that revelation usually comes to us. God uses his particular servants and
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:19.300]   raises them up so that they would go and disseminate this information. He says that the revelation
[00:09:19.300 --> 00:09:23.740]   came to John to the seven churches. And so the first three chapters we're going to be
[00:09:23.740 --> 00:09:28.220]   looking at the characters of the seven churches and the meaning of that. So we're just going
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:32.700]   to touch upon it today. And we're going to dive a little bit deeper into it next time.
[00:09:32.700 --> 00:09:40.660]   Because next time he's going to go directly into that. But why the seven churches? Why
[00:09:40.660 --> 00:09:45.860]   not the 30 churches? Or why not the 15 churches? If you know anything about that area, Asia
[00:09:45.860 --> 00:09:52.660]   Minor, how big is Asia Minor? Some of you guys who know the biblical geography. Is it
[00:09:52.660 --> 00:10:06.980]   the size of Florida? How big is Asia Minor? Land wise. Just a rough guess. Or you have
[00:10:06.980 --> 00:10:11.180]   no idea where Asia Minor is. I know some of you guys know where Asia Minor is. Remember
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:16.860]   in Paul's second missionary journey, he was about to go to Asia Minor. The Holy Spirit
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:23.500]   tells him not to go there. And then he crosses over and then he goes to Philippi. So that
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:30.520]   whole region he said not to go. Basically the size of Asia Minor would probably be about
[00:10:30.520 --> 00:10:36.780]   two thirds of the United States. It's about a half of Turkey. So if you know the size
[00:10:36.780 --> 00:10:42.340]   of Turkey, Turkey as a nation is huge. Land mass wise is huge. So majority of Apostle
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:50.260]   Paul's missionary journeys took place in this area. Right? So he's at the island of Patmos
[00:10:50.260 --> 00:10:57.860]   across the ocean, which is the short distance on the island. He's been basically banished
[00:10:57.860 --> 00:11:02.940]   to the island of Patmos for doing work in Asia Minor. But in that whole area, this letter
[00:11:02.940 --> 00:11:09.900]   is written to only seven churches. Now were there only seven churches at the time? No.
[00:11:09.900 --> 00:11:14.780]   Even in the scripture itself, it mentions other places. Like I think I mentioned Troas,
[00:11:14.780 --> 00:11:19.260]   Colossae, Hierapolis. I mean there are many other churches that are mentioned that Paul
[00:11:19.260 --> 00:11:23.660]   does not mention. So why does he single out these seven churches? Again, we don't know
[00:11:23.660 --> 00:11:29.100]   the exact answer for that. And again, I had a map but I can't show it to you for technological
[00:11:29.100 --> 00:11:36.140]   reasons. Okay. But one of the theory is that if you look at the map of the seven churches,
[00:11:36.140 --> 00:11:46.220]   it is kind of connected to each other. So the ancient history, or at least the roads
[00:11:46.220 --> 00:11:50.420]   that the Romans built, that every single one of these cities were not small towns. They
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:56.980]   were big towns and they were the most heavily populated. Therefore the trades and the commerce
[00:11:56.980 --> 00:12:03.060]   was very active. So you'll notice that not only Apostle Paul, but all the missionary
[00:12:03.060 --> 00:12:09.300]   work that is done in the early churches typically targeted big cities. It would make sense,
[00:12:09.300 --> 00:12:13.380]   humanly speaking it would make sense because that's where the most concentration of people
[00:12:13.380 --> 00:12:18.100]   were. So if Apostle Paul was to come and preach the gospel, he'd want to preach it to as many
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:23.980]   people as possible. So the early church, in order to maximize their effort, they targeted
[00:12:23.980 --> 00:12:29.160]   these large cities. So every one of these seven churches that we'll get into when we
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:35.540]   actually dive into those texts are churches that happen to be significant in size because
[00:12:35.540 --> 00:12:40.700]   of where they were. And there were easy roads that traveled between these cities that the
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:46.940]   Romans built for that purpose, for business purposes. Okay. So again, this is not a fact,
[00:12:46.940 --> 00:12:52.940]   but this is again, educated guess, I guess, by the scholars that this is probably the
[00:12:52.940 --> 00:12:58.220]   reason why these seven churches are targeted. But the number seven also is significant because
[00:12:58.220 --> 00:13:04.660]   whenever the Bible mentions the number seven, it signifies something perfection. Right?
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.060]   These are the seven churches of Christ. And so there's symbolic reason behind a number
[00:13:10.060 --> 00:13:14.900]   seven, but there's also practical reasons that these churches probably were larger than
[00:13:14.900 --> 00:13:25.040]   average churches. The revelation from Jesus Christ is given to His servants for the purpose
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:29.940]   of revealing it to others. Now that's a question that I proposed to you in the beginning. Why
[00:13:29.940 --> 00:13:38.260]   was revelation given to John? In fact, it wasn't just John. If you look at the passage,
[00:13:38.260 --> 00:13:42.180]   it says, "He made it known by sending His angels who bore witness to the Word of God
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:50.660]   and to His servants," in plural. Right? So he says, "The revelation is given to all of
[00:13:50.660 --> 00:14:00.340]   His servants, but in this particular situation for the churches, it is given to John." So
[00:14:00.340 --> 00:14:05.940]   if you look at it, the revelation given to His servant, or in particular John, is strictly
[00:14:05.940 --> 00:14:11.620]   for the purpose of making it known to other people. So when we talk about the good news,
[00:14:11.620 --> 00:14:18.140]   it's meant to be spread to those who will continue to spread the news. Right? So if
[00:14:18.140 --> 00:14:22.620]   we ask the Christian, if we're coming to God asking, it's like, "I'm just curious. I'm
[00:14:22.620 --> 00:14:28.860]   just curious to know who God is. I'm just curious." But a typical pattern that you will
[00:14:28.860 --> 00:14:34.140]   see in the Scripture is God reveals Himself to people who are ready to reveal Himself
[00:14:34.140 --> 00:14:41.260]   to others. Because that's the purpose of revelation. The purpose of revelation is not just for
[00:14:41.260 --> 00:14:49.740]   an individual. That's why the Gospel, the term Gospel, the good news of the cross, euangelion,
[00:14:49.740 --> 00:14:54.220]   there's a deliberate use of that word for a particular purpose. Because the Gospel was
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:15:02.620]   given with the understanding that it's meant to be spread. The Gospel saves us. It is the
[00:15:02.620 --> 00:15:07.780]   power of God for salvation to everyone who believes. First to the Jew, then to the Gentile.
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:11.500]   So when Paul says, "First to the Jews," it means that the Gospel first came. The news
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:17.900]   spread among the Jews because God has been preparing them to receive the Gospel message,
[00:15:17.900 --> 00:15:22.020]   even from their Old Testament history. Everything about the Jewish culture and their history
[00:15:22.020 --> 00:15:26.620]   and everything that they experienced was for the purpose of the Gospel to come and make
[00:15:26.620 --> 00:15:31.980]   sense to them. And then when Christ came and was resurrected, now He's opening the door
[00:15:31.980 --> 00:15:40.180]   for the Gospel to go to the Gentiles. So the very significance of what we're doing, the
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:45.100]   very purpose of this revelation is not so that we can come and say, "You know what?
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:48.140]   I didn't study revelation. I don't really know what's going on in revelation. So I should
[00:15:48.140 --> 00:15:54.060]   know it. I'm a Christian. So I should know it." That is not the purpose of revelation.
[00:15:54.060 --> 00:16:03.020]   Of course we should know it. Scripture has a completely different meaning when you are
[00:16:03.020 --> 00:16:11.740]   studying it for the purpose of sharing it. Now I have the exact opposite problem. My
[00:16:11.740 --> 00:16:18.220]   problem is everything I study, I study for the purpose of sharing. That's my problem.
[00:16:18.220 --> 00:16:25.140]   So ever since I started preaching, I wrote in the very beginning of my Bible to make
[00:16:25.140 --> 00:16:29.960]   sure that you study this for yourself. Make sure you study this for yourself because my
[00:16:29.960 --> 00:16:34.300]   natural inclination whenever I study is like, "Okay, this makes sense. This would make sense
[00:16:34.300 --> 00:16:43.220]   in Bible study. This would help me to preach the message." But having said that, if you
[00:16:43.220 --> 00:16:48.660]   don't study the Word of God with the intention of sharing in the Great Commission, there's
[00:16:48.660 --> 00:16:53.540]   a huge chunk of the Bible that won't make any sense to you. Even if it makes sense to
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:59.340]   you logically, you will never understand the heart of God. Because He's writing these things
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:06.620]   like, "Why does the church need to be pure?" Of course we want to bring more honor and
[00:17:06.620 --> 00:17:13.740]   glory to God. Because the whole purpose of the church is to shine His light so that the
[00:17:13.740 --> 00:17:20.260]   world may see who He is and that the world also may come and worship Him. And if our
[00:17:20.260 --> 00:17:24.440]   hearts and our mind and our intention is not engaged in the Great Commission, the Word
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:29.860]   of God, there's going to be a disconnect from God's intention and you're just going to hear
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:35.460]   His words, but you're not going to hear His heart. So when we study the book of Revelation,
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:39.700]   the purpose of the study of the book of Revelation is not so that you can say, "Well, I know
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:46.620]   what the black horse is. I figured out what the trumpet is or the bowl is." Right? I guarantee
[00:17:46.620 --> 00:17:51.100]   you you're going to come out more confused. I'm already telling you, you're going to come
[00:17:51.100 --> 00:17:57.300]   out more confused if that's our approach. The reason why we study the book of Revelation
[00:17:57.300 --> 00:18:05.300]   is to know Christ. It's going to be a revelation of who Christ is. And because of our knowledge
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:12.040]   of Christ, our knowledge of Christ, that it is for us to live soberly, eagerly anticipating
[00:18:12.040 --> 00:18:17.180]   for His coming. And then to encourage other people to remain sober and then bring other
[00:18:17.180 --> 00:18:24.500]   people to Christ as well. Right? So any Bible study that is disengaged with the Great Commission
[00:18:24.500 --> 00:18:28.940]   is not going to make much sense. It's looking at, you know, like an instruction manual with
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:35.500]   no intent of ever making any furniture. Right? You only look at the manual, you only look
[00:18:35.500 --> 00:18:40.660]   at that because you have intent of making something. And that's the purpose of Revelation.
[00:18:40.660 --> 00:18:46.740]   Revelation was given to Apostle Paul, to John, to all these disciples so that they may spread.
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:51.100]   And those who heard the message immediately went and told other people. And we're 2000
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:58.660]   years removed, but that purpose is never going to change until when? Until He comes. Right?
[00:18:58.660 --> 00:19:04.340]   Where does it say that? Matthew 24. Right? He says, until the gospel has gone to the
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:10.080]   remotest part of the world, until all the nations have heard, then the end will come.
[00:19:10.080 --> 00:19:14.020]   So until that happens, in other words, that hasn't happened yet. 2000 years later, it
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:19.740]   still hasn't happened yet. Until that happens, until the church is actively engaged in spreading
[00:19:19.740 --> 00:19:24.260]   this news to the remotest part of the world, and every nation, every tribe hears, He says
[00:19:24.260 --> 00:19:30.260]   the end will not come. So Revelation is for that purpose. Right? Is to reveal His truth
[00:19:30.260 --> 00:19:43.460]   to get us to go and get us to share. It is given to show His servants what must soon
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:48.420]   take place. Now the idea of soon, I'm not going to get too much into this today. There's
[00:19:48.420 --> 00:19:53.700]   a sense of urgency. Did you catch that? Right? Now you may read that and say, well, I can't
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:57.140]   understand if they were the first recipient that they thought maybe Jesus was going to
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:01.860]   come tomorrow. 2000 years later, do we still have that sense of urgency? Is this relevant
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:07.180]   today? And you can see why some people would read that and say, well, this must have been
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:12.520]   written for the first century people. Because it didn't happen soon. So if it was soon,
[00:20:12.520 --> 00:20:16.220]   it must have already happened. So we're looking at something that already happened and it's
[00:20:16.220 --> 00:20:21.260]   not in the future. Because if it's in the future, how can it be soon? Right? Why would
[00:20:21.260 --> 00:20:29.300]   there be a sense of urgency if it didn't happen after 2000 years? Yes? I hope you asked that
[00:20:29.300 --> 00:20:33.820]   because that will tell me that you were studying and wrestling with it before you came. Okay?
[00:20:33.820 --> 00:20:40.340]   Why would there be a sense of urgency studying this book? Right? Because the whole purpose
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:47.060]   of this Revelation is to give a sense of urgency so that His people will live with a sense
[00:20:47.060 --> 00:20:54.740]   of urgency. Right? Whether He comes tomorrow, whether He comes 1000 years later, He is coming.
[00:20:54.740 --> 00:21:01.960]   Right? He says to us 2000 years may seem like a long time, but to God, it's a split second.
[00:21:01.960 --> 00:21:09.260]   So part of the way we understand the soon is that everything that needed to happen before
[00:21:09.260 --> 00:21:17.020]   the end is about to come, for the Son of God to come, to live as a human being, to suffer,
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:23.820]   to die, to resurrect, to give the Holy Spirit, to renew the covenant. Everything that needs
[00:21:23.820 --> 00:21:29.580]   to happen for the end to come has happened. So it could have happened 1000 years ago.
[00:21:29.580 --> 00:21:33.900]   It could have happened 2000 years ago. So the question that the readers of Peter was
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:39.860]   asking is that we thought He was going to come right away. Right? If Jesus said it is
[00:21:39.860 --> 00:21:51.860]   finished, why didn't He come right away? How did He answer that? Don't worry, I'm not expecting
[00:21:51.860 --> 00:21:57.380]   an answer. I just want you to think about it. How did Peter answer that question? Because
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.500]   everybody is talking with a sense of urgency. He is coming. Paul says that it is his hope
[00:22:02.500 --> 00:22:09.740]   to preach the Gospel. Right? And he is praying that the Word of God may speed with urgency.
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:13.500]   So in the early church there was a sense of urgency. How do you and I have a sense of
[00:22:13.500 --> 00:22:20.300]   urgency 2000 years later? When the real issues that we are dealing with is getting promotion,
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:25.780]   paying our bills, right? Buying a house at the right time. Why would there be a sense
[00:22:25.780 --> 00:22:42.140]   of urgency? He hasn't come in 2000 years. How did Peter answer that? I'm trying to see
[00:22:42.140 --> 00:22:54.940]   if anybody, anybody is, any hint? I think you know. What did He say? So that more people
[00:22:54.940 --> 00:23:00.900]   may come to Christ. Right? In essence, in summary, that is what He says. 2000 years
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.380]   of being patiently waiting for sinners to repent to come to Him. So that more people
[00:23:05.380 --> 00:23:10.700]   can come. So that more of the Gospel may spread to the more remotest parts of the world. That
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:16.460]   is what He said. He said if He came 2000 years ago, we wouldn't be here. Our parents wouldn't
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:22.260]   be here. Our great grandparents wouldn't be here. Right? He said the purpose of His patience
[00:23:22.260 --> 00:23:28.020]   is so that the fullness of number of people entering the kingdom may be fulfilled before
[00:23:28.020 --> 00:23:32.420]   He comes. So that sense of urgency to get the Gospel out, whether He came 100 years
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:41.420]   ago or 3000 years later, isn't any different. Right? Because every generation is responsible
[00:23:41.420 --> 00:23:46.360]   for that generation. The previous generation cannot preach the Gospel to our generation.
[00:23:46.360 --> 00:23:50.620]   And our generation will not be able to preach the Gospel to the next generation. So all
[00:23:50.620 --> 00:23:57.780]   the people that are alive today is our responsibility. So there is a sense of urgency. So the first
[00:23:57.780 --> 00:24:03.860]   century people who read this, it is urgent for them. And it is urgent for us because
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:09.660]   how many people do we have? 7 billion people. Right? Remember what He says, Ezekiel, if
[00:24:09.660 --> 00:24:16.580]   I tell a sinner that judgment is coming and I tell you to go tell him and you don't tell
[00:24:16.580 --> 00:24:20.860]   him, what does he say? He says he will be judged for his sins, but you will also be
[00:24:20.860 --> 00:24:26.300]   judged for your sin for not obeying. If I tell you to go tell that sinner to repent
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.780]   and you tell him to repent and he doesn't repent, that sin is upon him, but you are
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:39.340]   guiltless because you've done your part. Right? It's no different for us. This revelation
[00:24:39.340 --> 00:24:48.220]   that He gives us, there is a sense of urgency because every single day we live around people
[00:24:48.220 --> 00:25:01.500]   who are going to hell. You believe that? We confess to believe it, right? But do you believe
[00:25:01.500 --> 00:25:07.500]   that? And I think that thought should sober us. That thought should cause us to think
[00:25:07.500 --> 00:25:11.780]   deeply on the things that we believe, on the things that we are studying and applying the
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:17.340]   things that we are studying. Right? Or else that sense of urgency is not going to exist
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:22.460]   in our heart. Again, I say all of this because if you read the scripture, it's not just the
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:26.900]   book of Revelation, every letter that is written, there is a sense of urgency to get the gospel
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:32.380]   out. Paul is writing Romans because he is trying to get to Spain. He never gets there,
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:38.820]   but his whole reason why he is writing this. Paul's ministry lasted maybe no more than
[00:25:38.820 --> 00:25:46.980]   like 15, 16 years. Right? All the scriptures that we are reading, all the churches that
[00:25:46.980 --> 00:25:52.300]   he planted, everything that he did, it was within 20 years. Our church has been around
[00:25:52.300 --> 00:25:57.540]   20 years already. He did all of that. Why did he do that? Why did he live like he was
[00:25:57.540 --> 00:26:03.820]   going to die tomorrow? Because there was a sense of urgency. He needed to get the gospel
[00:26:03.820 --> 00:26:09.380]   out. There was a sense of dire need that he is going to come soon, that we need to do
[00:26:09.380 --> 00:26:14.140]   everything that we can. That's why Paul said, "If you are going to run the race, run to
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:22.500]   win, not to just sign up, not to just say, 'I got a number,' but run to win." I say all
[00:26:22.500 --> 00:26:27.740]   of this because that's how this book starts. Right? That's how this book starts. Again,
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:31.420]   I'm going to get into a little bit more next week because he's going to pile it on some
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:40.700]   more. Okay? When he says these revelations have been given, it teaches us that these
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:52.160]   are not random events. It's God's preordained things that are going to take place. These
[00:26:52.160 --> 00:26:55.900]   are not just looking down the future and say, "Oh, I wonder when or how this is going to
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:27:05.180]   happen." These are preordained. That's why he is revealing these things. The content
[00:27:05.180 --> 00:27:15.100]   of his revelation is a record of what John heard and he saw. It reveals what he saw and
[00:27:15.100 --> 00:27:20.260]   heard and not necessarily what he understood. Now keep that in mind. Okay? And I'm going
[00:27:20.260 --> 00:27:30.120]   to put the next one up there so you can just fill in the blanks. Again, typically when
[00:27:30.120 --> 00:27:35.080]   we're reading scripture or any document that's removed from us in our culture, in our language,
[00:27:35.080 --> 00:27:40.600]   we have to contextualize how the early church would have understood this. Right? So when
[00:27:40.600 --> 00:27:49.320]   we see these images, we naturally may ask, "Why doesn't God make it clear?" Right? Because
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:54.240]   to us, if we want something clear, we want him to spell it out, write it out, describe
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:28:01.040]   it for us. Because you and I live in a written culture where the highest authority in our,
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   where we live, is a contract. Right? You describe what the contract is and what the details
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:12.000]   are. You do your part and this is my part. Right? And then even when we go to school,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.280]   we primarily learn through written word. We read things that were jotted down, we write
[00:28:16.280 --> 00:28:21.600]   that and then nothing is certain until it is written down and it's signed. How do you
[00:28:21.600 --> 00:28:29.640]   communicate these things to people who don't know how to read? Right? Again, understand
[00:28:29.640 --> 00:28:35.200]   in the first century, majority of the people, majority of the people in the church did not
[00:28:35.200 --> 00:28:39.360]   know how to read or write. Those of you who've been to India with us, you know, every time
[00:28:39.360 --> 00:28:45.040]   we go, we have to contextualize the things that we say because even the pastors, I would
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:49.240]   say, I don't know exactly what percentage is, but even the pastors, many of them have
[00:28:49.240 --> 00:28:54.120]   not been educated beyond third grade. So even third grade, at least they can read, at least
[00:28:54.120 --> 00:28:58.880]   some can read and some can write. But if you run into somebody who's sitting there and
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:03.040]   trying to understand what you're saying and they've never been taught how to read, never
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:09.320]   been taught how to write, your communication has to be very different. Right? Because a
[00:29:09.320 --> 00:29:14.480]   lot of times it's not verbal. Right? So our denomination came up with the way to share
[00:29:14.480 --> 00:29:21.880]   the gospel where it involves a lot of play acting. Right? But in our generation, or at
[00:29:21.880 --> 00:29:25.720]   least where we are, we kind of look at that as like, oh, we're trying to sensationalize
[00:29:25.720 --> 00:29:29.200]   the gospel, we're trying to make it attractive. But if you're talking to people who don't
[00:29:29.200 --> 00:29:34.240]   know how to read or write, that's the best way to communicate. Right? Isn't that the
[00:29:34.240 --> 00:29:39.880]   way we communicate to children? Because they're not able to verbalize their thoughts. When
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.080]   they sing these songs, they're not able to, like, we sing, it's like, oh, well, revelation,
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:48.440]   like, we're caught up with God. And a lot of these doctrines have meaning for us. But
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:53.760]   with children, they don't know. So when we say caught up, we say caught up. Right? He
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:58.600]   was resurrected. He's like, you resurrected. So we do all of these things to, so that the
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:30:03.840]   kids could see the physical action and they can visualize and say, oh, that's what it
[00:30:03.840 --> 00:30:08.440]   means. Right? So it's an extra step that we take to reveal something important, especially
[00:30:08.440 --> 00:30:14.880]   to people who don't know how to read or write. Right? So if you see what it says in verse
[00:30:14.880 --> 00:30:20.680]   2 and verse 11, it says that all the stuff that is being written down here are not things
[00:30:20.680 --> 00:30:26.320]   necessarily that he heard. It's things that he saw. Now, it doesn't mean that he didn't
[00:30:26.320 --> 00:30:32.800]   hear. He also heard. But basically, this is, the book of Revelation is a document of the
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:39.400]   things that he saw, a vision that Christ showed him of what is going to take place. So it
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:45.720]   doesn't tell us that John himself understood what he was writing. Right? We don't know
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:51.160]   if he understood or he didn't understand because he doesn't explain. He just tells us, he saw
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:59.800]   Jesus, he has eyes of fire. He has hairs of wool. Right? He has feet of bronze. And we're
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:05.600]   going to see that next week. Right? But he's just seeing a picture. Like Jesus shows him
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:13.240]   a vision and he's just writing down what he's seeing. And remember, what he is seeing is
[00:31:13.240 --> 00:31:21.440]   in heaven. Right? These are things that are not things that he can readily identify. So
[00:31:21.440 --> 00:31:26.920]   if you read the book of Revelation, he'll use a lot of imagery and he says, like. Right?
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:31.640]   And you'll see that also in the Old Testament prophets. It was like this. It was like that.
[00:31:31.640 --> 00:31:37.200]   Because they don't have anything specific. Right? So somebody who lived, let's say, even
[00:31:37.200 --> 00:31:45.000]   200 years ago. They come to Los Angeles and they start walking and they start describing
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.240]   what they see. How do you think their description was going to be? You think they're going to
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:58.200]   say, I saw an automobile that runs on gas. Right? And these roads were paved and they
[00:31:58.200 --> 00:32:02.040]   had lines and they had drivers and they were turning left or to the right. Is that how
[00:32:02.040 --> 00:32:06.840]   they would write it? They wouldn't know this. They wouldn't know how to write that. Because
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:12.020]   they don't know what an automobile is. They don't know what a cement pavement is. Right?
[00:32:12.020 --> 00:32:19.840]   They're going to say stone. If they had carriages, they say, I saw like strange carriages that
[00:32:19.840 --> 00:32:25.640]   are taking them down the road. Right? These people were dressed funny and they were very
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:33.320]   fast. Right? So they're going to describe what they're seeing with what they are able
[00:32:33.320 --> 00:32:43.880]   to describe. So Revelation is a written down document of what John saw. He may have seen
[00:32:43.880 --> 00:32:48.760]   a nuclear bomb. Right? And he said a third of the heavens disappeared and wormwood and
[00:32:48.760 --> 00:32:53.640]   so many Christians have gone through and studied how wormwood, that's a nuclear center out
[00:32:53.640 --> 00:32:58.600]   in Russia. And so he must have been talking about that. And if you look at it, it could
[00:32:58.600 --> 00:33:03.960]   be like what would happen that you and I could relate to that can destroy a third of the
[00:33:03.960 --> 00:33:09.360]   earth? It must be the nuclear bomb. We don't know that for sure. But imagine if you've,
[00:33:09.360 --> 00:33:14.840]   you know, the greatest weapon that you had was a spear. Right? And that's the closest
[00:33:14.840 --> 00:33:22.480]   thing that you can relate to. And then you see a vision of an explosion and massive hundreds
[00:33:22.480 --> 00:33:26.920]   of thousands of people just being slaughtered all at once. Like how would he describe that?
[00:33:26.920 --> 00:33:32.720]   Right? So a lot of the book of Revelation is just him looking down the line and he doesn't
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:37.600]   fully understand or he doesn't have the capacity to even explain. He's just jotting down what
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:45.200]   he sees. Right? So in some sense it is hidden, but the whole purpose of it is not to be hidden.
[00:33:45.200 --> 00:33:53.700]   He actually shows him the picture. Right? Now, because you and I live in a verbal society
[00:33:53.700 --> 00:33:57.160]   where written documents, if you want something clear, you want it written down so I can read
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:08.680]   it. Right? In an oral tradition, your communication, ability to memorize, what other ways would
[00:34:08.680 --> 00:34:21.000]   be a necessity or better way to communicate if you didn't know how to read or write? Songs?
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:27.880]   Yes. Songs. And that's exactly what they did in the early church. They sang the Bible.
[00:34:27.880 --> 00:34:34.560]   Anybody ever go to a Jewish synagogue? No reason to, unless you're in a seminary. If
[00:34:34.560 --> 00:34:39.680]   you ever visit a Jewish synagogue, about 80% of their worship is just singing. It's from
[00:34:39.680 --> 00:34:43.620]   the tradition that was passed down from the synagogues. So they would basically take a
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:48.280]   portion of the Torah and they would just sing it. So it's kind of weird to me. And it's
[00:34:48.280 --> 00:34:53.400]   not like the songs that we sing where it has a beat, it sounds a lot like the music we
[00:34:53.400 --> 00:35:00.120]   listen to on the radio. It just sounds like chanting. Because they're just reading and
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:05.560]   chanting. So everybody would chant along and that's how they went through scripture. Right?
[00:35:05.560 --> 00:35:10.560]   Or they would draw. I would think, if there's one skill that I really wish that I knew how
[00:35:10.560 --> 00:35:16.200]   to do is drawing. Because I think there are certain things that are better drawn, that
[00:35:16.200 --> 00:35:24.360]   you can see, than maybe verbalize. You know what I'm saying? Anyway. So again, the reason
[00:35:24.360 --> 00:35:27.800]   why I say all of this as an introduction to the book of Revelation is to give you the
[00:35:27.800 --> 00:35:33.160]   mindset of where we're going. Right? To give you a picture of why was this revealed in
[00:35:33.160 --> 00:35:39.160]   this way. So that even when things get difficult, just picture yourself watching this from a
[00:35:39.160 --> 00:35:46.000]   first century Jewish man. He's looking at something that may have happened 2,000 years,
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.920]   maybe 3,000 years down the line with all the technological advances. And that's what he's
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:36:02.440]   seeing and that's what he's jotting down. Okay? So the purpose of Revelation, he says,
[00:36:02.440 --> 00:36:09.800]   to bless all who reads aloud the words of the prophecy. I put verse 8, but it's not
[00:36:09.800 --> 00:36:24.080]   verse 8. Verse 3. Okay? So I made a mistake there. It's verse 3. To bless those who hear
[00:36:24.080 --> 00:36:32.840]   and ultimately bless those who keep what is written in it. So obviously we can understand
[00:36:32.840 --> 00:36:37.960]   to bless those who read aloud the words of the prophecy, because that was the primary
[00:36:37.960 --> 00:36:44.000]   way of what? Sharing. Right? When they received Paul's letters, somebody had to stand in front
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:49.280]   of the synagogue and read it out loud. Right? So it was meant to be read. And then for people
[00:36:49.280 --> 00:36:55.620]   to hear. And then ultimately, why do you read it and why do you hear it? Right? Verse 3.
[00:36:55.620 --> 00:36:58.640]   Blessed is the one who reads aloud the words of his prophecy and blessed are those who
[00:36:58.640 --> 00:37:04.760]   hear, who keep what is written in it for the time is near. So the whole purpose of reading,
[00:37:04.760 --> 00:37:12.960]   the whole purpose of hearing is to what? To keep. Right? So again, this exercise of studying
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.760]   the book of Revelation or any book of the Bible, the ultimate goal is not simply to
[00:37:16.760 --> 00:37:25.400]   know. It's to keep, to walk, to obey. Right? So the purpose of the book of Revelation is
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:34.360]   not to simply reveal, it's to get us to move. Right? What should be the end conclusion of
[00:37:34.360 --> 00:37:45.800]   knowing that judgment is coming? Pretty obvious, right? Move. Tell people. Hopefully it will
[00:37:45.800 --> 00:37:52.320]   create a sense of urgency to get out, to bring people to Christ. So that's why he says the
[00:37:52.320 --> 00:38:04.040]   purpose of it is to read, to hear, and to keep. Part B. We talk about Revelation from
[00:38:04.040 --> 00:38:10.600]   Jesus Christ. Now we're going to be talking about Revelation about Jesus Christ. I'm sorry.
[00:38:10.600 --> 00:38:17.400]   So if you look at verse 4, it starts out by saying, "John, to the seven churches that
[00:38:17.400 --> 00:38:23.240]   are in Asia, grace to you and peace from him who is and who was and who is to come." So
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:28.520]   this section, verse 4 to verse 8, basically is a revelation of Jesus Christ, about Jesus
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:36.120]   Christ. But if you look at verse 4 and verse 8, it begins and ends the same way. Right?
[00:38:36.120 --> 00:38:42.320]   Look at verse 4 and verse 8. So it begins by declaring God to be who was, who is, and
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:47.320]   who is to come. Verse 8, "I am the Alpha and Omega," says the Lord God, "who is and who
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:54.240]   was and who is to come, Almighty." So you see these as two bookends. Right? Before he
[00:38:54.240 --> 00:39:02.120]   goes into describing who Jesus is, he reminds the reader of God who was, who is, and who
[00:39:02.120 --> 00:39:07.680]   is to come. And then he concludes it by saying, don't forget that he's the Alpha and Omega.
[00:39:07.680 --> 00:39:12.200]   He basically has another exclamation mark and he reminds them again of who was, who
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:25.360]   is, and who is to come. Right? Now why do you think he does that? Think about if you
[00:39:25.360 --> 00:39:31.920]   are writing this letter to a group of people who are suffering for the name of Christ.
[00:39:31.920 --> 00:39:42.080]   How would that hit you? In fact, it's not just even the seven churches. They are experiencing
[00:39:42.080 --> 00:39:47.960]   all kinds of persecution. But think about John himself. Right? He's at the island of
[00:39:47.960 --> 00:39:53.080]   Patmos because he was put in boiling oil and they couldn't kill him. And out of fear of
[00:39:53.080 --> 00:39:57.160]   their gods, the superstition, they basically banished him at the island of Patmos. And
[00:39:57.160 --> 00:40:02.240]   island of Patmos, Google island of Patmos. Right? And I don't know what it looks like
[00:40:02.240 --> 00:40:06.400]   today, but if you Google island of Patmos, it's known to be a desolate place where there's
[00:40:06.400 --> 00:40:11.360]   nothing grows. So it's basically you throw your prisoners and people that you don't want
[00:40:11.360 --> 00:40:14.480]   to execute, but you don't want to hear from, you just put them on that island. So imagine
[00:40:14.480 --> 00:40:20.480]   how miserable John was. And I'm absolutely certain there was no medical care over there.
[00:40:20.480 --> 00:40:24.920]   Right? So probably eating was difficult. I don't know if the Romans left food for them
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:30.740]   or not, but imagine how miserable John must have been. John and the people who are receiving
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:39.720]   this letter, the first 300 years of the church was probably the most heavily persecuted period
[00:40:39.720 --> 00:40:43.520]   of Christian history. The first 300 years. And the first hundred years, and then the
[00:40:43.520 --> 00:40:51.340]   tail end of the 300 years was intense at the very end. But Paul is writing during a period
[00:40:51.340 --> 00:40:56.040]   when Nero began the persecution where you see all these pictures of Christians being
[00:40:56.040 --> 00:41:02.140]   dragged into the Colosseum. It was during that period, 65 AD to about 95 to 100 AD.
[00:41:02.140 --> 00:41:07.720]   And that's about the period when Paul is writing this letter. So to them, when you hear that
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:21.240]   your God is and was and who is to come, what would that do for you? Typically when you
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:29.800]   suffer, right? What's one of the greatest comforting aspects of our God? That He is
[00:41:29.800 --> 00:41:37.520]   sovereign. Yes? Because everything seems out of control. It seems unfair. What people have
[00:41:37.520 --> 00:41:42.480]   done, what is happening to you, why is this happening to me? But to know that our God
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.320]   is absolutely sovereign, that He hasn't lost control, therefore He hasn't lost control
[00:41:47.320 --> 00:41:54.720]   of you, right? It's a great source of comfort. So when He says Christ, before He goes into
[00:41:54.720 --> 00:41:58.720]   Christology of who He is and what He has done, He says the God who is speaking to you, the
[00:41:58.720 --> 00:42:03.800]   revelation that I'm giving to you is coming from who was, who is, who is to come. Who
[00:42:03.800 --> 00:42:12.400]   was? Everything, think about how much time we end up talking, you know, just thinking
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:16.480]   about maybe I should have done this differently. Maybe I should have done that. I should have
[00:42:16.480 --> 00:42:21.520]   trusted Him. I should have just trusted her. And we replay back painful memories thinking
[00:42:21.520 --> 00:42:27.360]   that only if we did this right, only if we did this wrong. But when we hear that God
[00:42:27.360 --> 00:42:35.120]   was, right? Everything that has happened in the past that you can't make sense of, God
[00:42:35.120 --> 00:42:42.400]   was. He was God then too. He's not just sovereign today. He was sovereign then. So if you're
[00:42:42.400 --> 00:42:47.480]   a child of God, God was sovereign over all that stuff. All the stuff that you can't understand
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:53.240]   that is unraveling in your life right now. I don't get it. I wish it wasn't so. But He
[00:42:53.240 --> 00:42:58.360]   is. Right? I mean He's completely sovereign today. There's nothing that happens that is
[00:42:58.360 --> 00:43:02.040]   outside of His control. No temptation that sees you but is coming to all men. But with
[00:43:02.040 --> 00:43:08.440]   temptation God will provide a way of escape. Right? Meaning that God is completely sovereign.
[00:43:08.440 --> 00:43:14.920]   That He hasn't lost control. God is and He is to come. Right? That everything that's
[00:43:14.920 --> 00:43:18.680]   happening now, our fear of maybe if we don't do things right, maybe it's going to head
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:25.240]   the wrong place and go out of control. God is sovereign in the future. So it's absolutely
[00:43:25.240 --> 00:43:31.640]   important for us as Christians that our faith in God is firmly planted on His sovereign
[00:43:31.640 --> 00:43:35.960]   plan, His sovereign power. Past, present, and future. And that's why I believe that
[00:43:35.960 --> 00:43:43.860]   this beginning of the Revelation, the book of Revelation, starts out with Christology.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:48.800]   But even understanding of Christology is within the context of God absolutely being sovereign.
[00:43:48.800 --> 00:43:54.260]   He was, He is, He is to come. He is the Alpha and He is the Omega. Right? I'm not going
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:58.520]   to go into it today but everything that is said about God the Father is also repeated
[00:43:58.520 --> 00:44:02.480]   somewhere else about Christ. Okay? But I'm not going to get into that today for the sake
[00:44:02.480 --> 00:44:11.860]   of time. So I'm going to go through the list of things that He mentions about who Jesus
[00:44:11.860 --> 00:44:21.840]   is. He is the faithful witness. Why is that the first thing that He says? There's so many
[00:44:21.840 --> 00:44:26.920]   things that we can talk about God. But the first thing that He says, remember, whenever
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:30.920]   you study the Bible, when you see a list of things, the thing that comes on the top usually
[00:44:30.920 --> 00:44:37.200]   is there deliberately. It's not just a random list of qualities of Jesus that He just kind
[00:44:37.200 --> 00:44:40.720]   of threw out and it just doesn't matter. Typically they didn't write like that. Whenever you
[00:44:40.720 --> 00:44:47.280]   see a list, the first one, two, three, usually has some significance. So why is His faithful
[00:44:47.280 --> 00:44:57.040]   witness the first thing that He says? One, this whole book of Revelation was about Revelation,
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:45:04.000]   about Him. But Jesus Himself said, right, that when He was going to the cross, He didn't
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.400]   say I'm going to save people. Even though that's what He was going to do, He didn't
[00:45:09.400 --> 00:45:12.000]   say I'm going to die and resurrect so that they can have life. Even though that's what
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:18.480]   He was going to do, what did He say? It's time to glorify, for the Son to glorify the
[00:45:18.480 --> 00:45:27.520]   Father, to reveal the Father. In Hebrews chapter one, turn to Hebrews chapter one. I mean it's
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:34.480]   right next door so you don't have to go too far. Those of you guys who know the book of
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:41.400]   Hebrew, the whole book of Hebrews is Christology, is doctrine of Christ. He begins the book
[00:45:41.400 --> 00:45:45.520]   by saying, long ago at many times in many ways God spoke to our fathers by the prophets,
[00:45:45.520 --> 00:45:53.360]   but in these last days He has spoken to us by His Son. So He breaks into Christology
[00:45:53.360 --> 00:45:59.560]   and He said the reason why Jesus Christ was revealed and did everything was for what purpose?
[00:45:59.560 --> 00:46:08.240]   To reveal the Father. So He drew near to us to reveal His Father. So He said, He said
[00:46:08.240 --> 00:46:12.480]   oh you know we can follow you, the disciples said, only if you would show us the Father.
[00:46:12.480 --> 00:46:17.200]   Remember what Jesus said? How long have I been with you and you still don't understand?
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:24.080]   If you have seen me, who have you seen? You have seen the Father. So the primary goal,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:30.760]   if the Old Testament says of God, His primary purpose in human history is His glory. How
[00:46:30.760 --> 00:46:36.240]   does He seek His glory? By seeking to save the lost. But His primary thing He says is
[00:46:36.240 --> 00:46:42.320]   to seek His glory. If God's primary thing is to seek His glory, then wouldn't be the
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:48.200]   primary thing for Jesus' ministry, first and foremost, is to bring glory to God, to
[00:46:48.200 --> 00:46:54.840]   reveal Him. So there is a reason why the first thing that is mentioned about Christ is His
[00:46:54.840 --> 00:47:03.760]   primary concern, and this may not sit well with a lot of people, because the way that
[00:47:03.760 --> 00:47:08.680]   we heard the Gospel, the way that we have grown up learning about Christianity, the
[00:47:08.680 --> 00:47:24.520]   primary purpose of Jesus is not you, and it's not me. That's not His primary purpose. His
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:31.120]   primary purpose is to reveal the Father. Now when He is revealed, we are saved. When He
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:38.640]   is revealed, we live, we have joy. But the primary thing that causes all of that is God.
[00:47:38.640 --> 00:47:46.400]   When God is glorified. In fact, when we become the center, we actually suffer. So He says
[00:47:46.400 --> 00:47:51.320]   He is a faithful witness. His primary thing that we see about Jesus, it causes us to see
[00:47:51.320 --> 00:47:59.960]   who God is. He is the firstborn among the dead. John 3, 16 is a passage where it says
[00:47:59.960 --> 00:48:07.640]   Jesus Christ was the only begotten Son. The word "the only begotten" is "mano genei,"
[00:48:07.640 --> 00:48:13.720]   meaning the only one. So it's not, a lot of people say, "Oh, He's the only begotten Son."
[00:48:13.720 --> 00:48:18.800]   And they focus on the begotten, but the purpose of this word is to say that He is primary,
[00:48:18.800 --> 00:48:25.480]   He is the only, there is no other like Him. But the word that is used here is "protocol,"
[00:48:25.480 --> 00:48:33.600]   which means firstborn, first compared to others who will follow. Meaning, primary identity
[00:48:33.600 --> 00:48:41.280]   of Christ is to be a faithful witness of His Father, to bring glory to His Father. Then
[00:48:41.280 --> 00:48:47.440]   He is firstborn among the dead. And how did He do that? He was crucified, He was resurrected.
[00:48:47.440 --> 00:48:53.160]   And when that happens, Him being the firstborn coming out, reveals the Father, and then many
[00:48:53.160 --> 00:49:04.280]   others will follow Him to do the same. So if He is described as the firstborn, that
[00:49:04.280 --> 00:49:09.720]   means all of us are second, third, fourth, fifth born. That's the way that this is used.
[00:49:09.720 --> 00:49:15.000]   Meaning that as He was resurrected from the dead, we will all be resurrected. And so in
[00:49:15.000 --> 00:49:21.520]   some sense, all of us receive partial resurrection because we are saved and we are also being
[00:49:21.520 --> 00:49:28.720]   saved. So if Jesus' whole existence, or at least the way He described to us in priority
[00:49:28.720 --> 00:49:35.400]   is to be a faithful witness of God the Father in His new life, what is our goal? Obviously
[00:49:35.400 --> 00:49:41.080]   the same. Our new life is not so that, "Hey, you have a new life, now go do whatever you
[00:49:41.080 --> 00:49:48.000]   want." And people use the Christian liberty and they apply it completely opposite of what
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:54.600]   Jesus meant. Or at least how it is used in the Bible. Christian liberty is to free us
[00:49:54.600 --> 00:50:00.280]   from our sin so that we can glorify the Father. It has nothing to do with, "Now it is my life,
[00:50:00.280 --> 00:50:03.840]   I can do whatever I want, since I don't have a penalty of sin." Like it is Christian liberty.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:08.400]   And anybody who says, "Don't do this, don't do that," is a legalist. That has nothing
[00:50:08.400 --> 00:50:13.840]   to do with Christian liberty. We are liberated for what purpose? So that we may be bound
[00:50:13.840 --> 00:50:23.400]   in righteousness. He is the ruler of the king. So again, as we are going through all of this,
[00:50:23.400 --> 00:50:29.520]   I want you to put on the mindset of somebody who is suffering. What would this mean to
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:40.680]   John, who just can't wait to die? Rome is not in control. He is the one, He is the king
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:51:03.480]   above the kings. Jesus is ultimately sovereign. He loved us and the way He loved us is He
[00:51:03.480 --> 00:51:18.080]   freed us from our sins. You notice how His love for us is letter D, not A. Again, I don't
[00:51:18.080 --> 00:51:22.160]   want to read more into it than it is, but I think it is worth noting. Because like I
[00:51:22.160 --> 00:51:27.920]   said, whenever there is a list, there is a list for a reason. Of course He loves us.
[00:51:27.920 --> 00:51:36.040]   Of course He died for us. But His primary is to glorify the Father. What is interesting
[00:51:36.040 --> 00:51:42.560]   here is a tense that is used. If you look at verse 5, it says, "If any of you lacks
[00:51:42.560 --> 00:51:52.800]   wisdom, let him ask," where am I? Revelation 5, it says, "And from Jesus Christ, a faithful
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:58.080]   witness, the firstborn among the dead, ruler of the kings of the earth, to Him who loves
[00:51:58.080 --> 00:52:03.720]   us and has freed us from our sins by His blood." So the word love here is in the present tense
[00:52:03.720 --> 00:52:09.640]   and the freed is in the era tense. So it is two separate tense using the same sentence.
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:17.640]   Now significance of that is that proper understanding of it is Christ loves us continuously, meaning
[00:52:17.640 --> 00:52:23.160]   that His love for us is ongoing, continuous. But the reality of that love specifically
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:32.440]   is expressed through His sacrifice for us, through the redemption. So what brought Him
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:37.640]   to give His life for us, ultimately is love. Because love is a constant, but the expression
[00:52:37.640 --> 00:52:41.880]   of that, the era tense basically means something that happened specifically, an event that
[00:52:41.880 --> 00:52:47.240]   took place that has its effect today. That is the era tense. The present tense is ongoing,
[00:52:47.240 --> 00:52:53.840]   continuous. So the fact that John writes it, or the revelation comes to us in love in the
[00:52:53.840 --> 00:52:59.200]   present tense and freed us in the era tense is significant, meaning that Jesus Christ
[00:52:59.200 --> 00:53:04.840]   does not need to save us over and over and over again. Because He loved us when He said
[00:53:04.840 --> 00:53:09.760]   it was finished and we confessed our sins and He forgave us of our sins, it is a past
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:14.800]   event that has its effect today. So salvation does not need to be repeated over and over
[00:53:14.800 --> 00:53:30.800]   again. Now again, think of it as, if you are suffering under the Roman rule, right? I mean
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:36.720]   persecution under the Jews were horrible, right? They got stoned, dragged out. But the
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:41.200]   persecution when the Romans decided to persecute them, that is when it got really ugly. Because
[00:53:41.200 --> 00:53:45.720]   all the power that they had, right? All the reach that they had, they had nowhere to hide
[00:53:45.720 --> 00:53:50.080]   from the Romans. You could hide somewhere from the Jews, but not from the Romans. I
[00:53:50.080 --> 00:53:54.920]   mean they were the superpower. You can't run from them. So He is saying that He is the
[00:53:54.920 --> 00:54:01.400]   King over all the kings. And He made us Himself the kingdom. So they are not in the kingdom
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:05.800]   of Romans. He is now, because He delivered us, now He is under the rule of the real King,
[00:54:05.800 --> 00:54:15.880]   the King over all kings. And the whole book of Revelation, again just practical application,
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:20.600]   before we get all caught up in the meaning and application of all of this, the end conclusion
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:25.400]   of the book of Revelation is to tell people who are suffering under intense persecution
[00:54:25.400 --> 00:54:33.040]   of the Roman government, saying that no, the real King that you may not see, He is in charge.
[00:54:33.040 --> 00:54:38.260]   The Alpha and Omega is in charge. Because of what Christ has done, you are under a new
[00:54:38.260 --> 00:54:49.000]   King and you are in His kingdom and you have been made kingdom of priests. Right? So our
[00:54:49.000 --> 00:54:53.520]   whole goal of sanctification, evangelism, church building, disciple making, all of it
[00:54:53.520 --> 00:54:59.840]   is so that His kingdom may come. And that is the primary meaning of the prayer, the
[00:54:59.840 --> 00:55:06.880]   Lord's prayer, is a prayer of surrender. Thy kingdom come, Thy will be done on earth as
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:20.440]   it is in heaven. And as a result of that, glory and dominion ultimately belong to Him.
[00:55:20.440 --> 00:55:28.680]   So again, if you or John sitting on the island of Patmos, suffering, maybe not able to eat,
[00:55:28.680 --> 00:55:36.640]   just excruciating pain, and he is writing, glory and dominion ultimately belongs to Him.
[00:55:36.640 --> 00:55:42.600]   Right? And he is writing this thing. So what do you think he is thinking about? I think
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:54.080]   it would give him tremendous hope. Right? That His Savior has won the battle. He is
[00:55:54.080 --> 00:56:01.640]   just waiting for it to be consummated. Right? It's done. He is not watching to see, I hope
[00:56:01.640 --> 00:56:07.120]   Christ can conquer Rome. Right? That's not how the book of Revelation ends. He is not
[00:56:07.120 --> 00:56:11.960]   writing this thing, saying like strategizing what the church needs to do. He is not telling
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:16.200]   the church, strategize and do this and this is how you make disciples, this is how you
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:22.680]   plant church. That's not what He says. He says, this is going to happen. Despite you,
[00:56:22.680 --> 00:56:28.840]   despite me, this is going to happen. Right? Who would have thought 2000 years, if you
[00:56:28.840 --> 00:56:35.040]   study church history, humanly speaking, the church should have died in the first century.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:43.280]   Right? Humanly speaking, Nero's persecution should have squashed Christianity. Right?
[00:56:43.280 --> 00:56:48.800]   There were 10 known intense persecutions, the first 300 years of Christianity, and that's
[00:56:48.800 --> 00:56:54.480]   when Christianity grew the fastest. That's when it went to Europe, it went to Asia, it
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:59.000]   went to the Middle East. Right? These guys, I mean think about it, this is before planes
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:05.300]   and Facebook and all this stuff. They literally just got on a tiny boat, traveled half a year
[00:57:05.300 --> 00:57:10.920]   to go somewhere where they don't speak the language to preach the gospel. Right? During
[00:57:10.920 --> 00:57:15.400]   a period when they, I mean humanly speaking, it should have been completely squashed. And
[00:57:15.400 --> 00:57:20.240]   the only reason why we are here today, and again I'm just talking about persecution,
[00:57:20.240 --> 00:57:25.960]   but if you look at the false doctrines, the corruption of the church, the Pope himself
[00:57:25.960 --> 00:57:31.800]   who represented God, at least to the people at that time, he had more power than kings.
[00:57:31.800 --> 00:57:39.920]   He was basically selling salvation for money. This wasn't the one guy. This is all his disciples,
[00:57:39.920 --> 00:57:46.600]   everybody underneath. How long did this happen? Hundreds and hundreds of years. False doctrines.
[00:57:46.600 --> 00:57:51.720]   Somebody would stand up to preach the right gospel, they would burn him at the stake.
[00:57:51.720 --> 00:57:55.240]   Somebody wants to translate the Bible so that the common people can read it, they would
[00:57:55.240 --> 00:58:00.100]   burn him at the stake. So the church was killing their own prophets, just like the Israelites
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:07.280]   were doing. So if you look at human history, the Israelites, the church, right? And even
[00:58:07.280 --> 00:58:14.560]   today, right? How few people know what is contained in this book. Even though thousands
[00:58:14.560 --> 00:58:18.800]   of people attend church every single Sunday. You would think humanly speaking, if we weren't
[00:58:18.800 --> 00:58:23.620]   part of it, we would remove ourselves like this is not going to make it. How many times
[00:58:23.620 --> 00:58:28.760]   in human history did they say that this is going to destroy Christianity? And 2000 years
[00:58:28.760 --> 00:58:33.880]   later it's still thriving. And the only reason why is because Jesus said, I will build my
[00:58:33.880 --> 00:58:38.920]   church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it. Because He is, He was, and He
[00:58:38.920 --> 00:58:44.560]   will be. Because He is the Alpha and Omega, not you and me. So imagine if you're John
[00:58:44.560 --> 00:58:50.440]   reading this and writing this, this is a huge comfort, huge strength to him. He doesn't
[00:58:50.440 --> 00:58:55.440]   say this might happen. He says this is going to happen. This is how human history ends
[00:58:55.440 --> 00:59:06.920]   because of Christ. He's coming in the clouds. This is again prophesied in Daniel 7, 13 to
[00:59:06.920 --> 00:59:10.260]   14. And as we're going through the book of Revelation, we're going to be referring quite
[00:59:10.260 --> 00:59:16.640]   a bit to Daniel 7. So if you're one of those studious people that kind of want to get ahead,
[00:59:16.640 --> 00:59:25.400]   I encourage you to go through the book of Daniel. Okay, in particular 7 through 9. Again,
[00:59:25.400 --> 00:59:31.440]   I have it all in my middle. Let me see if it comes up. It might come up after we're
[00:59:31.440 --> 00:59:48.680]   done. And then it says, all will see and wail because of Him. This wailing is not repentance.
[00:59:48.680 --> 00:59:54.920]   This wailing is, they finally realize that all that was said was true and that there's
[00:59:54.920 --> 01:00:04.160]   no way to turn back. Right? So when Christ comes, He's going to come to redeem His church,
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:13.040]   but He will also come to bring judgment. So His coming is a double-edged sword. It is
[01:00:13.040 --> 01:00:19.720]   a comfort for those who are suffering for the name of Christ, but He will, but is also
[01:00:19.720 --> 01:00:45.440]   a final judgment for those who are standing on the wrong side. All right. All right, I'm
[01:00:45.440 --> 01:00:50.800]   going to conclude and I know some of you are probably sick of me saying it, but I'm going
[01:00:50.800 --> 01:00:57.320]   to say it again. Okay? Why did I choose to jump into the book of Revelation? Because
[01:00:57.320 --> 01:01:03.680]   this is not the easiest book to study. I have to study twice as hard to understand and to
[01:01:03.680 --> 01:01:07.440]   present this, so it's easier for me to jump into something else. But the reason why I
[01:01:07.440 --> 01:01:13.640]   wanted to study the book of Revelation is for everything that I've already said. Our
[01:01:13.640 --> 01:01:21.480]   primary struggle in our walk with God is lukewarmness. Let's be honest. Right? Because I struggle
[01:01:21.480 --> 01:01:27.000]   with it. Because it's easy. Christianity is easy. And I'm not saying that it has to be
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:31.640]   hard or God, like you know, like hit yourself in the morning just so that you can understand
[01:01:31.640 --> 01:01:40.000]   the suffering with Christ. But the temptation to just kind of go along. Just get to next
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:49.960]   Sunday and just do my part. I hope you realize just how dangerous that is. It doesn't feel
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:58.080]   dangerous. Right? There's no warning signs. There's no immediate consequence. But I hope
[01:01:58.080 --> 01:02:04.720]   you realize just how dangerous that is for someone who confesses the gospel that we profess
[01:02:04.720 --> 01:02:12.480]   to believe. That we study the book of Revelation and it's a revelation of His judgment coming.
[01:02:12.480 --> 01:02:20.080]   And to study it, not as a novel, not for entertainment, but something that's going to happen. And
[01:02:20.080 --> 01:02:26.160]   then to have it not affect us deeply. And then live our lives like the rest of everybody
[01:02:26.160 --> 01:02:35.720]   else in the world. Just how dangerous that is. That we have these seeds that are being
[01:02:35.720 --> 01:02:43.160]   planted. Some don't understand so they don't come. Some have superficial fruit, but as
[01:02:43.160 --> 01:02:50.800]   soon as first testing comes, they disappear. But the third soil that bears some fruit,
[01:02:50.800 --> 01:02:58.120]   that has memories of being passionate for God. At one point was sold out for Jesus.
[01:02:58.120 --> 01:03:04.400]   But the worries of this life, the concerns for our families, for the future, is choking
[01:03:04.400 --> 01:03:09.820]   our faith. And then what is the end result of choking our faith? It doesn't say they
[01:03:09.820 --> 01:03:21.020]   limp into the kingdom. It says they die. Right? So a step before we die is lukewarmness.
[01:03:21.020 --> 01:03:25.180]   That's why lukewarmness is so dangerous. I'm not saying that we need to yell and scream
[01:03:25.180 --> 01:03:30.300]   and dance and show like, oh yeah, look how on fire I am for God. But you know your own
[01:03:30.300 --> 01:03:37.020]   heart. You know how distracted you are. You know the things that you think about when
[01:03:37.020 --> 01:03:41.620]   you're not at church. Things that make you mad. Things that make you sad. May have nothing
[01:03:41.620 --> 01:03:47.780]   to do with God. Right? And my hope is that as we study through the book of Revelation,
[01:03:47.780 --> 01:03:56.440]   at least this Revelation, He who reads it out loud, who hears it, who keeps it, that
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:04:01.020]   we would come under the Lord's blessing. Let me pray for us and then ask you guys to break
[01:04:01.020 --> 01:04:09.500]   up into your small groups. We have discussion questions. Oh, I have it there. Okay. Take
[01:04:09.500 --> 01:04:14.180]   a picture of this. And then you can break up into your groups and just spread out throughout
[01:04:14.180 --> 01:04:20.660]   the church. But let me pray for us and then find your small groups and spread out today.
[01:04:20.660 --> 01:04:26.740]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening. I thank you so much for Lord God for our church,
[01:04:26.740 --> 01:04:32.580]   that even in our struggles that we have each other. Help us Lord God not to be awkward,
[01:04:32.580 --> 01:04:41.000]   to spur one another on, that our love for you may not simply be a Facebook post. Help
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:47.740]   us Lord God to live daily, wrestling and struggling with our own heart. That we may be surrendered,
[01:04:47.740 --> 01:04:51.620]   that we may confess our love for you, that even in our weakness Lord God, that we would
[01:04:51.620 --> 01:04:57.700]   have no other place to turn but to you. I pray that your living word would judge the
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:02.460]   thoughts and intentions of our heart. Help us to see the glimpse of the glory of the
[01:05:02.460 --> 01:05:09.260]   gospel of Jesus Christ, that we may love you with all our heart. Remind us again Father
[01:05:09.260 --> 01:05:14.260]   God how temporary this world is, that we may follow you and you alone. In Jesus name we
[01:05:14.260 --> 01:05:15.140]   pray. Amen.
