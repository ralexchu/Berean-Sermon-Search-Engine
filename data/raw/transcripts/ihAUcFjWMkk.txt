[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:46.760]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:01:46.760 --> 00:01:48.360]   We will now begin our service.

[00:05:32.040 --> 00:05:40.440]   - All right, good morning,
[00:05:40.440 --> 00:05:42.440]   and welcome to Beroean Community Church.
[00:05:42.440 --> 00:05:47.840]   Let me give you a few announcements before we get started.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.040]   Again, I wanna thank you for your prayers
[00:05:50.040 --> 00:05:52.920]   for our Korea Mission team.
[00:05:52.920 --> 00:05:55.160]   And we know we gave an update last week,
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:56.440]   so I'm not gonna get into any of it
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:05:59.600]   other than the fact that thank you for your prayers.
[00:05:59.600 --> 00:06:03.280]   And I was very concerned about my knees when I left,
[00:06:03.280 --> 00:06:05.520]   and so I know a lot of people were praying for me.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:09.240]   And every day, you know, it got better as I was walking,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:10.760]   and so I was able to make it through the trip.
[00:06:10.760 --> 00:06:13.080]   So thank you for your prayers for that.
[00:06:13.080 --> 00:06:16.120]   We made some really important contacts while we were there
[00:06:16.120 --> 00:06:20.080]   with some university professors who are asking us to come
[00:06:20.080 --> 00:06:21.800]   and to help reach the campuses,
[00:06:21.800 --> 00:06:24.560]   'cause the campuses are basically,
[00:06:24.560 --> 00:06:28.800]   right now the country, supposedly around 30 to 33%
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:30.960]   claim to be Christians, but on campus,
[00:06:30.960 --> 00:06:32.400]   they say anywhere from three,
[00:06:32.400 --> 00:06:35.600]   and the professors think it's even less than 1%.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:38.000]   And so they're completely losing the next generation.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.480]   And so the professors who are missionaries on campus,
[00:06:41.480 --> 00:06:43.720]   who are professors there, are asking us to come
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:45.720]   and help them reach the students there
[00:06:45.720 --> 00:06:46.880]   with our English program.
[00:06:46.880 --> 00:06:49.000]   And so we'll see what that leads to,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:50.840]   but again, it was a very fruitful trip,
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:52.720]   and we wanna thank you all for your prayers
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:54.480]   and support through that.
[00:06:54.480 --> 00:06:58.480]   Today, after the second service at 1 p.m.,
[00:06:58.480 --> 00:07:00.040]   we have a Jubilee Fellowship.
[00:07:00.040 --> 00:07:02.960]   Jubilee are people who are 50 and over at church,
[00:07:02.960 --> 00:07:05.080]   and I know a lot of people who come to church
[00:07:05.080 --> 00:07:08.780]   and think there's 50 and over people at our church.
[00:07:08.780 --> 00:07:10.040]   You'd be surprised how many people
[00:07:10.040 --> 00:07:11.080]   are over 50 in our church.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:13.120]   So we're gathering together for the purpose
[00:07:13.120 --> 00:07:15.080]   of getting to know each other and fellowship.
[00:07:15.080 --> 00:07:18.240]   And so at 1 p.m. at Bill Barber Park,
[00:07:18.240 --> 00:07:20.000]   there's gonna be lunch provided,
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:21.960]   and it's $10 for the lunch,
[00:07:21.960 --> 00:07:24.440]   and then it's a casual time of just fellowshiping
[00:07:24.440 --> 00:07:26.200]   and getting to know the other people
[00:07:26.200 --> 00:07:27.680]   in our similar life stage.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:30.760]   So that'll happen after second service at Bill Barber Park.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:31.960]   If you wanna know where that is,
[00:07:31.960 --> 00:07:33.040]   or you're not familiar with the area,
[00:07:33.040 --> 00:07:34.240]   just go to the welcome table
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.760]   or ask somebody that looks your age,
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:41.600]   and they'll be able to help you to know where that is, okay?
[00:07:41.600 --> 00:07:42.880]   Fig Ministry.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:44.820]   This is a family in God ministry.
[00:07:44.820 --> 00:07:47.760]   If you're not part of the FAM 245, newly married,
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:50.720]   or you're not part of the Jubilee ministry,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:53.360]   this ministry basically is all the family ministry for you.
[00:07:53.360 --> 00:07:55.700]   This is a new ministry that started this year.
[00:07:55.700 --> 00:07:59.600]   Our brother Dean and Helen are overseeing that,
[00:07:59.600 --> 00:08:02.320]   and they're taking sign-ups for the next stage,
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.400]   the third round of Bible reading
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.360]   through Colossians to Revelation.
[00:08:07.360 --> 00:08:09.300]   It's starting on August 1st.
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:11.280]   So they'll put you into a small group of people
[00:08:11.280 --> 00:08:12.960]   where you're reading through scripture together,
[00:08:12.960 --> 00:08:14.760]   and for the purpose of fellowship,
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:16.280]   but meaningful fellowship,
[00:08:16.280 --> 00:08:18.120]   as you're reading through scripture together.
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:21.720]   So if you signed up for that, for the previous one,
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.400]   and you want to go continue, please re-sign up,
[00:08:24.400 --> 00:08:26.740]   and if you want to join in at this point,
[00:08:26.740 --> 00:08:28.460]   again, you're welcome to join as well.
[00:08:28.460 --> 00:08:30.660]   So please sign up for that.
[00:08:30.660 --> 00:08:31.920]   I think there are sign-up tables.
[00:08:31.920 --> 00:08:33.120]   As you're walking outside,
[00:08:33.120 --> 00:08:35.760]   there'll be tables for you to be able to visit.
[00:08:35.760 --> 00:08:37.720]   Cleaning and Maintenance Day at church
[00:08:37.720 --> 00:08:39.560]   on August 10th at 9 a.m.
[00:08:39.560 --> 00:08:41.760]   This is a Saturday, and so this happens
[00:08:41.760 --> 00:08:44.500]   either biannually or quarterly, I forget.
[00:08:44.500 --> 00:08:46.720]   But if you can come and help us that day,
[00:08:46.720 --> 00:08:49.900]   at 9 a.m. on Saturday, if you just show up,
[00:08:49.900 --> 00:08:50.900]   they'll tell you what to do,
[00:08:50.900 --> 00:08:52.500]   and it'll be for a couple hours,
[00:08:52.500 --> 00:08:55.500]   and that'll help us to kind of maintain our church facility.
[00:08:55.500 --> 00:08:59.260]   And then lastly, Family Ministry Summer Retreat
[00:08:59.260 --> 00:09:01.660]   that's happening on August 16th through the 18th.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:04.740]   The theme is God's Design for Marriage,
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:07.180]   and Dr. John Street is gonna be coming
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:11.380]   on the Design for Marriage.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.740]   And Dr. John Street, as some of you guys know,
[00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:17.220]   when we had our all-church retreat a few years ago,
[00:09:17.220 --> 00:09:20.060]   he spoke on the subject of reconciliation and repentance,
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.840]   and I think it was very impactful for our church.
[00:09:23.840 --> 00:09:26.820]   The other topic that Dr. John Street is really known for
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:28.540]   is this topic on marriage.
[00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.380]   And so if you haven't signed up,
[00:09:30.380 --> 00:09:33.660]   there's a few more spaces for you to be able to come.
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:36.420]   We're almost booked, but if you are planning to come,
[00:09:36.420 --> 00:09:39.140]   please do not hesitate, and we wanna encourage you guys
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.380]   to come and benefit from the teaching
[00:09:41.380 --> 00:09:44.460]   and the sessions that we'll have there.
[00:09:44.460 --> 00:09:49.100]   But that weekend, we will have a regular service here, okay?
[00:09:49.100 --> 00:09:50.980]   Only second and third service, though.
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:52.380]   We won't be having first service,
[00:09:52.380 --> 00:09:53.900]   but only second and third service.
[00:09:53.900 --> 00:09:55.540]   So if you're normally coming to second service,
[00:09:55.540 --> 00:09:56.660]   it wouldn't affect you.
[00:09:56.660 --> 00:09:58.340]   If you normally come to first service,
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:02.260]   that weekend, we won't have service at 8 a.m., okay?
[00:10:02.260 --> 00:10:03.940]   And there's no childcare happening
[00:10:03.940 --> 00:10:05.580]   because all the family and all the people
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:07.940]   who are helping out with Sunday school
[00:10:07.940 --> 00:10:09.620]   will be up at the retreat site,
[00:10:09.620 --> 00:10:10.940]   and so just keep that in mind.
[00:10:10.940 --> 00:10:13.020]   We'll remind you as we get closer to the date,
[00:10:13.020 --> 00:10:16.940]   but that's happening on August 16th and 18th, that weekend.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:18.020]   Okay?
[00:10:18.020 --> 00:10:19.500]   All right, let me pray for us
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:23.420]   and give you an opportunity to give online,
[00:10:23.420 --> 00:10:25.020]   and then if you brought a physical check
[00:10:25.020 --> 00:10:27.380]   or a physical offering, we do have a box in the back.
[00:10:27.380 --> 00:10:29.320]   As you're walking out, you'll see it to the right,
[00:10:29.320 --> 00:10:32.140]   and you can visit that as you're on your way out.
[00:10:32.140 --> 00:10:33.620]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:10:37.660 --> 00:10:40.180]   Father, we thank you so much for your blessing.
[00:10:40.180 --> 00:10:44.200]   Thank you for the things that we are aware of
[00:10:44.200 --> 00:10:47.380]   and the many things, Lord God, that you are orchestrating
[00:10:47.380 --> 00:10:49.500]   that we oftentimes miss.
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:52.380]   Help us to have greater faith.
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:54.900]   Help us to have greater vision.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:10:58.620]   That we would not be entangled with civilian affairs.
[00:10:58.620 --> 00:11:02.700]   That we would truly give ourselves, Lord God,
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:04.680]   to you and to your cause.
[00:11:05.740 --> 00:11:08.540]   That as you have come to seek and save the lost,
[00:11:08.540 --> 00:11:12.220]   that we would be a church, Lord God, that joins your work.
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:14.020]   We pray for your grace as we continue

[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.880]   to Luke chapter eight.
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:30.880]   And I'll be reading from verse 22
[00:20:30.880 --> 00:20:36.440]   onto verse 25.
[00:20:37.720 --> 00:20:40.320]   Luke chapter eight, verse 22 through 25.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:45.560]   Now on those days, Jesus and His disciples
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:47.400]   got into a boat and He said to them,
[00:20:47.400 --> 00:20:49.640]   "Let us go over to the other side of the lake."
[00:20:49.640 --> 00:20:51.480]   So they launched out.
[00:20:51.480 --> 00:20:53.160]   But as they were sailing along,
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.800]   He fell asleep and a fierce gale of wind
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:20:58.720]   descended on the lake and they began to be swamped
[00:20:58.720 --> 00:21:00.600]   and to be in danger.
[00:21:00.600 --> 00:21:02.260]   They came to Jesus, woke Him up, saying,
[00:21:02.260 --> 00:21:04.800]   "Master, Master, we are perishing."
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:06.440]   And He got up and rebuked the wind
[00:21:06.440 --> 00:21:08.580]   and the surging waves and they stopped
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:10.680]   and it became calm.
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:13.440]   And He said to them, "Where is your faith?"
[00:21:13.440 --> 00:21:15.500]   They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another,
[00:21:15.500 --> 00:21:17.800]   "Who then is this that He commands
[00:21:17.800 --> 00:21:21.720]   even the winds and the water and they obey Him?"
[00:21:21.720 --> 00:21:22.560]   Let's pray.
[00:21:22.560 --> 00:21:29.620]   Father, we thank You for Your loving grace.
[00:21:29.620 --> 00:21:31.880]   We thank You for Your living Word.
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.020]   We pray that Your Spirit would illuminate these words
[00:21:35.020 --> 00:21:37.520]   according to Your will and Your purpose.
[00:21:37.520 --> 00:21:40.920]   Help us, Lord God, to have open ears and softened hearts,
[00:21:40.920 --> 00:21:42.320]   that we may be molded, Lord God,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:45.160]   as You are the potter and we are the clay.
[00:21:45.160 --> 00:21:46.560]   Protect this pulpit, Lord God,
[00:21:46.560 --> 00:21:49.600]   that only Your thoughts and Your words would go forth.
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:51.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:21:51.360 --> 00:21:58.560]   So as you guys know, coming back from Korea and India
[00:21:58.560 --> 00:22:04.040]   and it's a pretty grueling trip,
[00:22:04.040 --> 00:22:05.900]   especially 'cause I had to go visit India
[00:22:05.900 --> 00:22:07.800]   and I was on the road for about 40 hours
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:10.340]   and I haven't fully adjusted yet.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.200]   In fact, today I almost overslept.
[00:22:13.200 --> 00:22:16.720]   You know, I woke up at seven and my thought was,
[00:22:16.720 --> 00:22:18.640]   "Hmm, I think I need to be somewhere at eight o'clock."
[00:22:18.640 --> 00:22:20.480]   I forgot what it was and I, "Oh shoot,"
[00:22:20.480 --> 00:22:22.360]   and I jumped out of bed, you know,
[00:22:22.360 --> 00:22:23.960]   and then I got ready and I came.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:25.760]   And so, you know, people keep asking me,
[00:22:25.760 --> 00:22:28.720]   "How long are you gonna be able to keep doing this?"
[00:22:28.720 --> 00:22:32.440]   But, you know, the benefit of short-term missions
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:35.000]   and any kind of missions, but the short-term missions is,
[00:22:35.000 --> 00:22:36.240]   you know, I get to spend a lot of time
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:37.080]   with our team members.
[00:22:37.080 --> 00:22:38.600]   Obviously it benefits our church
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:42.080]   because we want our church to constantly be reminded
[00:22:42.080 --> 00:22:44.540]   of the Great Commission that God has given us.
[00:22:44.540 --> 00:22:46.280]   So we don't ever want to become a church
[00:22:46.280 --> 00:22:50.800]   where we're more concerned about, you know,
[00:22:50.800 --> 00:22:52.240]   certain things that are happening at church
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.720]   with the exclusion of the Great Commission, right?
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:55.960]   That's the heartbeat of our church.
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:58.340]   So we want not just short-term members,
[00:22:58.340 --> 00:22:59.540]   but that when they come back,
[00:22:59.540 --> 00:23:01.800]   we always encourage them to share your thoughts
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:04.120]   and things that you learn so that that spirit
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.880]   would continue to be, you know, thriving
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:08.360]   and spreading inside the church.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:10.840]   So we want everything that we do,
[00:23:10.840 --> 00:23:13.820]   whether it's Bible study or small group or membership,
[00:23:13.820 --> 00:23:14.960]   whatever it is that we're doing,
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:16.940]   it's in the context of the Great Commission
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.880]   that he called us to engage in.
[00:23:20.880 --> 00:23:22.520]   But part of the side benefit is,
[00:23:22.520 --> 00:23:24.840]   I get to know our team members intimately,
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.520]   especially as our church grows.
[00:23:26.520 --> 00:23:28.260]   It's hard to spend that kind of time,
[00:23:28.260 --> 00:23:30.520]   and going out to short-term missions is a fast track
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:32.420]   to be able to get to know people, you know?
[00:23:32.420 --> 00:23:34.640]   And it's always surprising to me
[00:23:34.640 --> 00:23:37.120]   how people have a perception of who I am
[00:23:37.120 --> 00:23:39.720]   because you mainly only see me on the pulpit.
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:41.800]   But I remember when I first got married,
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.040]   or not married, but when I first started dating Esther,
[00:23:44.040 --> 00:23:45.320]   one of the first things that she told me
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:48.200]   was how the persons that she got to know me
[00:23:48.200 --> 00:23:50.680]   as she was dating and the person that she thought I was
[00:23:50.680 --> 00:23:53.120]   in the pulpit was completely different.
[00:23:53.120 --> 00:23:55.440]   And I said, "What's different?"
[00:23:55.440 --> 00:23:57.600]   And she said, "You're really goofy."
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:23:58.800]   That's what she said.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:02.880]   And what surprised me wasn't that she thought I was goofy,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:05.720]   but you didn't know that, you know what I mean?
[00:24:05.720 --> 00:24:07.480]   I thought that was common knowledge.
[00:24:07.480 --> 00:24:10.200]   But I think because a lot of times,
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:12.520]   especially as the church grows,
[00:24:12.520 --> 00:24:13.920]   you only see me up in the pulpit.
[00:24:13.920 --> 00:24:16.640]   So it's an opportunity for me to get to know you,
[00:24:16.640 --> 00:24:20.160]   those people who go, and vice versa, right?
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:22.660]   I share all of this because I'm trying to set up
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:25.740]   the context in Jesus' ministry when Jesus says
[00:24:25.740 --> 00:24:27.200]   to his disciples, "Come, follow me,
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:29.920]   "and I will make you disciples of men."
[00:24:29.920 --> 00:24:31.880]   And so you see, for all three years,
[00:24:31.880 --> 00:24:34.080]   there was an end goal to what he was doing
[00:24:34.080 --> 00:24:35.800]   with his disciples.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.160]   He was trying to prepare them so that when he departs,
[00:24:39.160 --> 00:24:41.560]   that they will be able to carry the gospel.
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:43.720]   But of the main thing that he was doing,
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:46.280]   he was trying to reveal himself to them
[00:24:46.280 --> 00:24:48.640]   so that when they are ready,
[00:24:48.640 --> 00:24:53.640]   Jesus would ask the question, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:24:53.640 --> 00:24:56.200]   And they needed to get this right.
[00:24:56.200 --> 00:24:58.480]   They needed to know clearly his identity
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:00.800]   because the primary thing that they're going
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.920]   to be a witness for is about Jesus.
[00:25:03.920 --> 00:25:09.200]   So they can work hard and sacrifice and get organized,
[00:25:09.200 --> 00:25:12.940]   but if they don't know Christ, they'll miss the whole point.
[00:25:12.940 --> 00:25:16.600]   And so his ministry was about revelation of himself,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:20.680]   mainly to his disciples and to others who are following him.
[00:25:20.680 --> 00:25:23.720]   So the text that we're looking at,
[00:25:23.720 --> 00:25:26.560]   there's a series of things where Jesus is revealing himself.
[00:25:26.560 --> 00:25:29.120]   Luke records it in this order.
[00:25:29.120 --> 00:25:32.340]   In the text that we're looking at today in verse 22 to 25,
[00:25:32.340 --> 00:25:35.040]   it shows Jesus's power over nature.
[00:25:35.040 --> 00:25:40.160]   The next text, it shows us Jesus's power over the demons,
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:41.860]   verse 26 through 39.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:44.840]   And then verse 40 to 48,
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.880]   it reveals Jesus's power over disease.
[00:25:48.880 --> 00:25:51.260]   And then in verse 49 to 56,
[00:25:51.260 --> 00:25:53.820]   it shows us Jesus's power over death.
[00:25:53.820 --> 00:25:57.500]   And every one of these incidences ends with
[00:25:57.500 --> 00:26:02.140]   the recipients or the people who see this
[00:26:02.140 --> 00:26:05.780]   in fear and amazement of Jesus.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:08.500]   So it's not by accident that these things are organized
[00:26:08.500 --> 00:26:12.220]   very deliberately because Luke wanted to convey
[00:26:12.220 --> 00:26:15.820]   that this is what Jesus was trying to teach his disciples,
[00:26:15.820 --> 00:26:17.500]   that they would recognize who he is,
[00:26:17.500 --> 00:26:20.420]   that they knew he was the Messiah, but really, who is he?
[00:26:20.420 --> 00:26:22.820]   They wanted them to encounter Christ.
[00:26:22.820 --> 00:26:26.160]   So today, we're gonna be looking at Jesus's power
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:30.500]   over nature and the details of it and what it teaches us.
[00:26:30.500 --> 00:26:34.060]   First thing that when you look at the story
[00:26:34.060 --> 00:26:35.940]   of Jesus calming the storm,
[00:26:35.940 --> 00:26:38.660]   the first thing that we ask is the contrast
[00:26:38.660 --> 00:26:40.960]   between the disciples and Jesus.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:44.600]   We have the disciples who are freaking out.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.380]   They think they're gonna die.
[00:26:47.380 --> 00:26:50.340]   And they're actually even upset with Jesus for sleeping.
[00:26:50.340 --> 00:26:52.220]   Don't you care?
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:57.220]   And then, Jesus is asleep, right, in the middle of a storm.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.260]   So the contrast between the two response
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:02.260]   to the storm couldn't be further.
[00:27:02.260 --> 00:27:07.320]   We wanna look at this morning, what does that convey to us,
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.340]   and what Jesus said, and what was his goal,
[00:27:09.340 --> 00:27:11.620]   and what was he trying to reveal, right?
[00:27:11.620 --> 00:27:13.680]   How was he trying to teach them?
[00:27:13.680 --> 00:27:17.740]   So the first thing, the disciples were afraid,
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.700]   which is an understatement.
[00:27:18.700 --> 00:27:20.780]   Luke chapter eight, 23 to 24 says,
[00:27:20.780 --> 00:27:24.780]   a fierce gale of wind descended on the lake.
[00:27:24.780 --> 00:27:28.060]   So I want you to understand
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:31.940]   that this was not just some average storm, right?
[00:27:31.940 --> 00:27:35.020]   These aren't new people on the boat
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:39.020]   who's not used to the waves moving up and down.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:41.140]   He said there was a fierce gust of wind
[00:27:41.140 --> 00:27:44.520]   descended on the lake, and it began to be swamped,
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:48.180]   meaning that the water was starting to come into the boat,
[00:27:48.180 --> 00:27:49.860]   but they were genuinely afraid,
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:51.820]   and it says, and they were in danger.
[00:27:51.820 --> 00:27:53.660]   They came to Jesus and woke him up,
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:27:57.740]   and saying, "Master, Master, we are perishing."
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:01.100]   Now, were they being melodramatic, right?
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:02.420]   Was it just the wind came in,
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:03.820]   and the boat was just rocking,
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:07.080]   and they're just afraid, you know?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:09.320]   And Jesus wakes up and says, "Hey, calm down, calm down.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:11.580]   "It's not that bad," right?
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.720]   That's not the picture that is painted for us.
[00:28:13.720 --> 00:28:16.020]   He said they were genuinely concerned.
[00:28:16.020 --> 00:28:18.900]   In Mark 4:38, it says Jesus himself was in the stern,
[00:28:18.900 --> 00:28:21.460]   sleeping on a cushion, right?
[00:28:21.460 --> 00:28:23.860]   And I'm not sure why that detail is in there,
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:27.380]   other than to tell us that he was very comfortable, right?
[00:28:27.380 --> 00:28:29.980]   He was on a cushion, and they woke him and said to him,
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:34.900]   "Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?"
[00:28:34.900 --> 00:28:37.020]   Now, I want you to understand the context
[00:28:37.020 --> 00:28:40.860]   of what is being described, right?
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.220]   One, this was not just an average storm.
[00:28:44.220 --> 00:28:47.500]   This was genuinely life-threatening.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:49.540]   And so, we can easily relate
[00:28:49.540 --> 00:28:51.300]   to what the disciples are doing, right?
[00:28:51.300 --> 00:28:53.800]   How many of you, if there was a storm,
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.580]   and you're being swamped,
[00:28:56.580 --> 00:28:57.580]   that you would sit there quietly,
[00:28:57.580 --> 00:29:00.300]   "Hey, relax, Jesus is on the boat, right?
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:01.500]   "Relax."
[00:29:01.500 --> 00:29:05.360]   Their response is a normal response.
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:06.580]   It is a human response.
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:10.540]   We would expect every single human being on that boat
[00:29:10.540 --> 00:29:11.980]   to respond in this way.
[00:29:11.980 --> 00:29:13.820]   And you also have to understand
[00:29:13.820 --> 00:29:16.540]   that many of these guys are professional fishermen.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:22.300]   And these are most likely generational fishermen
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:24.300]   that they probably inherited from their father,
[00:29:24.300 --> 00:29:25.220]   their grandfather,
[00:29:25.220 --> 00:29:27.900]   and so we don't know how many generations of fishing
[00:29:27.900 --> 00:29:29.180]   that they were doing.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:31.120]   And they were at the lake
[00:29:31.120 --> 00:29:34.540]   where they depended on their livelihood.
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:36.020]   So they were very familiar.
[00:29:36.020 --> 00:29:38.000]   And most likely, even the boat that they were on
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.840]   was probably Peter's boat.
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:42.940]   So they grew up, since they were children,
[00:29:42.940 --> 00:29:46.220]   they saw their parents, their grandparents doing this,
[00:29:46.220 --> 00:29:49.940]   and probably, they were very familiar
[00:29:49.940 --> 00:29:53.180]   with the different storms that would come in and out.
[00:29:53.180 --> 00:29:58.260]   So for these professional fishermen to be freaked out,
[00:29:58.260 --> 00:30:00.980]   it means that this was a real threat.
[00:30:00.980 --> 00:30:02.940]   They were very, very concerned.
[00:30:02.940 --> 00:30:06.580]   I know sometimes that we can kind of get inoculated,
[00:30:06.580 --> 00:30:10.620]   especially if you live in Southern California.
[00:30:10.620 --> 00:30:13.900]   And I heard that July 5th, the day that I flew in,
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:17.420]   that there was a 7.5 earthquake in Mojave Desert.
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:19.460]   How many of you guys were aware of that?
[00:30:19.460 --> 00:30:21.020]   Very few of you, right?
[00:30:21.020 --> 00:30:22.240]   And because of that,
[00:30:22.240 --> 00:30:26.220]   they said that there's been smaller tremors,
[00:30:26.220 --> 00:30:30.180]   maybe 1.5, two, maybe even up to three, 3.5 tremors.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:32.080]   Any of you have felt that?
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:32.920]   Yeah.
[00:30:32.920 --> 00:30:34.500]   Most of us who live in Southern California,
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:38.740]   if it's not six or higher nearby, we don't move, right?
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:42.620]   And I've lived near train tracks.
[00:30:42.620 --> 00:30:45.340]   So for me, the house needs to start to crack
[00:30:45.340 --> 00:30:47.240]   before I think like this is an earthquake, right?
[00:30:47.240 --> 00:30:51.860]   'Cause I'm used to my house shaking every few hours, right?
[00:30:51.860 --> 00:30:55.140]   So you can imagine if Peter and the other fishermen,
[00:30:55.140 --> 00:30:58.940]   that this is their lifelong occupation,
[00:30:58.940 --> 00:31:03.620]   coming handed down generationally in the same sea,
[00:31:03.620 --> 00:31:05.740]   probably in the same boat,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:07.780]   that if they're freaking out,
[00:31:07.780 --> 00:31:10.300]   that every single one of us
[00:31:10.300 --> 00:31:13.100]   would have been in the same boat, right?
[00:31:13.100 --> 00:31:15.580]   So we can understand why they were freaking out.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:19.120]   The mystery is not them.
[00:31:19.120 --> 00:31:21.700]   The mystery is Jesus.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:23.200]   How was he sleeping?
[00:31:23.200 --> 00:31:27.860]   How was he sleeping on a nice, comfortable cushion, right?
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:31.340]   I don't know if you've ever been so tired
[00:31:31.340 --> 00:31:34.380]   that you just ended up passing out, right?
[00:31:34.380 --> 00:31:35.940]   I remember a few years ago,
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:39.100]   some of you guys were with me during that period.
[00:31:39.100 --> 00:31:40.860]   I was trying to, we were on our way to India,
[00:31:40.860 --> 00:31:45.660]   and I found out that I read my visa dates backward,
[00:31:45.660 --> 00:31:47.980]   and basically I couldn't get into India.
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:50.900]   And so I was stuck in France with my summer clothes
[00:31:50.900 --> 00:31:52.440]   in the middle of winter,
[00:31:52.440 --> 00:31:54.200]   and I had to stay up for two nights straight.
[00:31:54.200 --> 00:31:59.200]   So on the road there and two nights in France,
[00:31:59.200 --> 00:32:02.860]   and so I didn't get to sleep for almost three days.
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:05.220]   And I got my visa, I flew into India.
[00:32:05.220 --> 00:32:06.300]   Soon as I landed,
[00:32:06.300 --> 00:32:08.260]   our team was ready to go out to the village.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:10.300]   And so I joined them, went to the village,
[00:32:10.300 --> 00:32:13.180]   and next thing I remember after being in the village
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.920]   and starting the medical camp,
[00:32:14.920 --> 00:32:17.020]   waking up with a table over me
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:22.260]   with bags and whatever clothes that they brought,
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:25.220]   like covering me, so basically hide me.
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:27.780]   And I woke up thinking, what is this?
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:30.020]   And I asked the team, what happened?
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:33.980]   They said, "Man, you passed out and you were snoring."
[00:32:33.980 --> 00:32:37.500]   And so we had these dozens of people coming into the room,
[00:32:37.500 --> 00:32:39.420]   and you were a little bit of a distraction.
[00:32:39.420 --> 00:32:42.180]   So they put me in the corner of the room,
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.980]   and they covered me, and there's a table over me,
[00:32:45.980 --> 00:32:47.700]   and that's how I woke up, right?
[00:32:47.700 --> 00:32:50.060]   And that's how tired I was that day,
[00:32:50.060 --> 00:32:51.700]   and I was able to adjust
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.140]   and start from the next day get going.
[00:32:54.140 --> 00:32:55.860]   But even in that situation,
[00:32:55.860 --> 00:32:58.340]   if my life was being threatened,
[00:32:58.340 --> 00:33:00.700]   I'm pretty sure I would've woken up, right?
[00:33:00.700 --> 00:33:01.680]   I would've been dead tired,
[00:33:01.680 --> 00:33:04.540]   but I'm pretty sure I would've woken up.
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:07.020]   Just how tired was Jesus
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:12.020]   that professional generational fishermen were freaking out?
[00:33:12.020 --> 00:33:16.260]   We're going to perish, they weren't being overdramatic,
[00:33:16.260 --> 00:33:20.020]   that this was a real life-threatening situation,
[00:33:20.020 --> 00:33:21.920]   and it says Jesus was sleeping.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:25.900]   Now, again, those of you who've been to India with us,
[00:33:25.900 --> 00:33:30.900]   we get a taste of what it must've been like for Jesus, right?
[00:33:30.900 --> 00:33:33.620]   Because the first year we went in
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:35.660]   to the village to do the work,
[00:33:35.660 --> 00:33:38.060]   we got in there not knowing what to expect,
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:40.380]   and there would be 100 to 200,
[00:33:40.380 --> 00:33:41.580]   and sometimes even more than that,
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:42.780]   waiting for us at the village.
[00:33:42.780 --> 00:33:44.500]   And so as soon as the camp started,
[00:33:44.500 --> 00:33:47.240]   we would have a long line of people,
[00:33:47.240 --> 00:33:49.820]   and those of you guys who've been there with us,
[00:33:49.820 --> 00:33:53.880]   it's very difficult having crowd control.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:55.700]   And so even though we start with a line,
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:33:58.900]   10 minutes into it, there are 20, 30 of them at the door,
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:00.580]   shoving their way, trying to go in,
[00:34:00.580 --> 00:34:04.180]   and after about two, three hours of this, it's exhausting.
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:05.660]   And I remember the very first trip,
[00:34:05.660 --> 00:34:07.260]   because we didn't know what we were doing,
[00:34:07.260 --> 00:34:09.460]   we had it set up, get up, get started,
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:11.420]   and then about the time that sun would go down,
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.580]   about four or five o'clock, we would pack up and leave.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:15.300]   And we did this for all five days,
[00:34:15.300 --> 00:34:17.500]   and we had one eye doctor.
[00:34:17.500 --> 00:34:21.180]   And so Karen was in there with the tent that they made,
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:23.740]   and she was under there sweating all day,
[00:34:23.740 --> 00:34:25.600]   and I remember, it's like, wow, this is gonna be hard,
[00:34:25.600 --> 00:34:27.140]   but we made it through the whole week.
[00:34:27.140 --> 00:34:30.540]   But after the first year, I remember having the discussion,
[00:34:30.540 --> 00:34:32.660]   it's like, I don't think we can do this, right,
[00:34:32.660 --> 00:34:33.620]   not all five days.
[00:34:33.620 --> 00:34:35.340]   So it took us a couple years to adjust,
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.980]   and so we shortened it to four days,
[00:34:37.980 --> 00:34:40.460]   and we had to do something about the crowd control,
[00:34:40.460 --> 00:34:41.980]   and so we had to pass out numbers
[00:34:41.980 --> 00:34:43.620]   and had to get the pastors involved,
[00:34:43.620 --> 00:34:45.460]   and then we shortened the day.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:48.100]   Instead of having six hours, we would shorten it,
[00:34:48.100 --> 00:34:50.220]   and then about three o'clock, we'd try to end it,
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:54.060]   and even then, about four or five hours
[00:34:54.060 --> 00:34:56.280]   of constantly fighting the crowd,
[00:34:56.280 --> 00:34:58.940]   and by the time we leave,
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:00.820]   there's always a group of people that we can't see,
[00:35:00.820 --> 00:35:02.260]   and then we have to get in the van and leave,
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:04.020]   and so it's exhausting.
[00:35:04.020 --> 00:35:06.180]   So we cut it to four days, and then the fifth day,
[00:35:06.180 --> 00:35:08.940]   we rest, and then we go back to the airport and we come out,
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:10.400]   and even then, it's pretty exhausting.
[00:35:10.400 --> 00:35:12.780]   Everybody is pretty knocked out.
[00:35:12.780 --> 00:35:15.900]   You know, we literally land, start the work,
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:17.860]   when the work is done, we get on the plane, we come out.
[00:35:17.860 --> 00:35:19.200]   We come back out, right?
[00:35:19.200 --> 00:35:22.020]   But everyone who's been there,
[00:35:22.020 --> 00:35:25.460]   you can imagine what it was like for Christ.
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:29.180]   If just for a few days, we're that tired,
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:32.540]   trying to see some of these people.
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:35.980]   Imagine, Jesus is two years into his ministry,
[00:35:35.980 --> 00:35:40.340]   and it says that the crowd wasn't just 20, 30, 100 people.
[00:35:40.340 --> 00:35:43.460]   It says by the time Jesus feeds the 5,000,
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:45.340]   most likely that number was closer to 20,000.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:47.780]   Can you imagine 20,000 people,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.620]   and they're not in a controlled environment?
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:52.020]   They don't have a door to watch.
[00:35:52.020 --> 00:35:54.680]   Everywhere Jesus is going, people are bombarding him,
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.780]   stretching out, trying to touch him and get to him,
[00:35:56.780 --> 00:36:00.260]   and so the disciples are constantly doing crowd control.
[00:36:00.260 --> 00:36:03.340]   Most likely, in my opinion,
[00:36:03.340 --> 00:36:05.220]   the reason why Jesus kept on getting on the boat
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.340]   is because this is the only place
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:08.080]   where they couldn't get to him.
[00:36:08.080 --> 00:36:11.780]   Everywhere he went, remember, after he feeds the 5,000,
[00:36:11.780 --> 00:36:14.820]   he's so tired, he goes to the other side of the sea?
[00:36:14.820 --> 00:36:18.060]   And guess what, they followed him.
[00:36:18.060 --> 00:36:20.260]   Oh, where did you go?
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:22.980]   You know, and the honest answer was away from you.
[00:36:22.980 --> 00:36:26.420]   And sometimes, not only from the crowd,
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.660]   he had to break away from even his own disciples
[00:36:28.660 --> 00:36:31.180]   'cause sometimes they were troublemakers.
[00:36:31.180 --> 00:36:33.340]   So he would sneak away at night, you know,
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:34.500]   and we always look at that and say,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:36.380]   Jesus spent time with his father
[00:36:36.380 --> 00:36:39.060]   because he knew how important prayer was,
[00:36:39.060 --> 00:36:40.680]   and all that is true,
[00:36:40.680 --> 00:36:42.700]   but I think Jesus was just getting away
[00:36:42.700 --> 00:36:47.260]   to take a break 'cause he was so tired.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:51.500]   Well, the scene that we see here,
[00:36:51.500 --> 00:36:54.960]   Jesus was that tired, humanly speaking.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:01.300]   And so, he was resting, and the disciples come to him,
[00:37:01.300 --> 00:37:03.860]   and they said, "Do you not care?
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.020]   "Do you not care?"
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:09.300]   You know, if I was a leader on a trip,
[00:37:09.300 --> 00:37:11.560]   and I fell asleep, and there's some danger happening,
[00:37:11.560 --> 00:37:13.300]   and they're banging on the door, and I'm asleep,
[00:37:13.300 --> 00:37:15.760]   and they're banging, banging, and banging,
[00:37:15.760 --> 00:37:17.880]   and I'm guessing that by this time,
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:20.380]   the disciples exhausted all other option.
[00:37:20.380 --> 00:37:24.180]   You know, Peter probably was telling them,
[00:37:24.180 --> 00:37:25.920]   he's like, "Yeah, I've been in this situation before.
[00:37:25.920 --> 00:37:27.300]   "You know, make sure you lean to the left,
[00:37:27.300 --> 00:37:28.360]   "lean to the right.
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.460]   "Make sure you focus your attention on this,"
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:32.800]   'cause they probably have done this hundreds of times,
[00:37:32.800 --> 00:37:35.820]   so my guess is they've exhausted every possibility,
[00:37:35.820 --> 00:37:38.180]   and none of this was working.
[00:37:38.180 --> 00:37:40.900]   And so, they come to Jesus desperate
[00:37:40.900 --> 00:37:44.100]   because they really thought that they were going to die,
[00:37:44.100 --> 00:37:45.220]   and he's sleeping.
[00:37:46.300 --> 00:37:50.280]   How can you be sleeping in the middle of this?
[00:37:50.280 --> 00:37:52.080]   Now, I would think if I was in that situation,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:53.020]   I would say, "Oh, oh, shoot.
[00:37:53.020 --> 00:37:54.620]   "I was so tired, sorry.
[00:37:54.620 --> 00:37:56.280]   "Now, what do you want me to do?"
[00:37:56.280 --> 00:38:00.660]   If you notice that Jesus doesn't give them techniques,
[00:38:00.660 --> 00:38:03.400]   Jesus doesn't say, "You know what?
[00:38:03.400 --> 00:38:05.700]   "I know you tried all of this, but lean to your left,
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.440]   "and focus on this, and try this,"
[00:38:07.440 --> 00:38:10.920]   and he doesn't figure out a way to get out of the storm.
[00:38:10.920 --> 00:38:13.620]   He stops the storm itself.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.140]   I don't think that the disciples were thinking
[00:38:17.140 --> 00:38:19.100]   that that's what Jesus was going to do.
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:22.040]   They were probably thinking that,
[00:38:22.040 --> 00:38:23.980]   even though they're the professional fishermen,
[00:38:23.980 --> 00:38:24.820]   and he's the Messiah,
[00:38:24.820 --> 00:38:26.740]   and we've seen him perform miracles,
[00:38:26.740 --> 00:38:29.640]   and maybe they were gonna walk on the water, I don't know.
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:33.020]   Maybe he was going to learn
[00:38:33.020 --> 00:38:36.780]   how to direct the path of the boat,
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.940]   but he stands up, and he just rebukes the storm.
[00:38:40.940 --> 00:38:42.740]   And it's interesting, in verse 24,
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.660]   is that he got up and rebuked the wind,
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:49.380]   and surging waves, and they stopped, and it became calm.
[00:38:49.380 --> 00:38:50.460]   Don't you think it's interesting
[00:38:50.460 --> 00:38:54.640]   that he doesn't just say, "Hey, stop,"
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:58.480]   that Luke and the other Gospels use the term rebuke.
[00:38:58.480 --> 00:39:01.740]   Usually, when we think of rebuke,
[00:39:01.740 --> 00:39:03.820]   it's somebody who's in rebellion.
[00:39:03.820 --> 00:39:05.420]   Something's going wrong,
[00:39:05.420 --> 00:39:07.900]   like you would rebuke somebody, a friend or a child,
[00:39:07.900 --> 00:39:11.820]   who's not obeying, and so you rebuke them,
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:13.180]   because they're not behaving
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:14.980]   the way they're supposed to behave.
[00:39:14.980 --> 00:39:17.980]   And that's the term that is used.
[00:39:17.980 --> 00:39:19.740]   When Jesus looked at the storm,
[00:39:19.740 --> 00:39:20.580]   he doesn't just calm,
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:23.660]   he doesn't just wave his hand, and it just disappears.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:26.980]   He rebukes it like he's talking to a human being.
[00:39:26.980 --> 00:39:29.020]   "Stop!"
[00:39:29.020 --> 00:39:31.640]   And it says, immediately, it disappeared.
[00:39:31.640 --> 00:39:35.220]   Can you imagine the disciples watching this,
[00:39:35.220 --> 00:39:38.460]   and rightly so, they're asking,
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:41.320]   "What kind of a man is this,
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:47.500]   "that he has power and authority to tell the storm?"
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:51.940]   Now, we can get into a situation,
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.140]   we have financial issues, or we're hungry,
[00:39:54.140 --> 00:39:56.020]   or we can get in all kinds of situations,
[00:39:56.020 --> 00:39:59.020]   but natural disasters are something
[00:39:59.020 --> 00:40:02.820]   that you and I don't have much control over, if any.
[00:40:02.820 --> 00:40:04.860]   Even with all the modern technology,
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:07.740]   we can maybe foresee it coming, maybe.
[00:40:07.740 --> 00:40:10.340]   Or maybe we can build a bunker,
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.820]   go deep underneath to avoid the storm.
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.020]   We can have rescues, or we can have boats
[00:40:17.020 --> 00:40:19.220]   filled with technology to come and get you.
[00:40:19.220 --> 00:40:24.140]   But the actual storm itself, we have no answer to.
[00:40:24.140 --> 00:40:26.600]   If it happens, you're completely helpless.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.180]   So Jesus doesn't control the environment,
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:33.860]   he tells the storm itself to stop!
[00:40:33.860 --> 00:40:36.620]   And it doesn't take five minutes,
[00:40:36.620 --> 00:40:38.220]   it doesn't take multiple tries.
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:40.940]   He says, as soon as he says, "Stop,"
[00:40:40.940 --> 00:40:43.940]   the storm obeys, it obeys.
[00:40:43.940 --> 00:40:47.860]   It obeys!
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:52.660]   Even nature obeys God.
[00:40:52.660 --> 00:40:57.500]   Some people believe that Psalm 107, 24-30,
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.580]   was a Messianic passage, describing this very scene.
[00:41:01.580 --> 00:41:02.700]   And if you read it, you can see
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:04.300]   why some people would think that.
[00:41:04.300 --> 00:41:06.540]   Psalm 107, 24-30.
[00:41:06.540 --> 00:41:08.220]   "They have seen the works of the Lord
[00:41:08.220 --> 00:41:10.280]   "and his wonders in the deep,
[00:41:10.280 --> 00:41:13.400]   "for he spoke and raised up a stormy wind,
[00:41:13.400 --> 00:41:15.740]   "which lifted up the waves of the sea.
[00:41:15.740 --> 00:41:17.860]   "They rose up to the heavens,
[00:41:17.860 --> 00:41:19.060]   "they went down to the depth,
[00:41:19.060 --> 00:41:21.240]   "their soul melted away in their misery,
[00:41:21.240 --> 00:41:24.380]   "they reeled and staggered like a drunken man,
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:26.060]   "and were at their wits' end.
[00:41:26.060 --> 00:41:28.380]   "Then they cried to the Lord in their trouble,
[00:41:28.380 --> 00:41:30.500]   "and he brought them out of their distresses,
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.740]   "he caused the storm to be still,
[00:41:32.740 --> 00:41:35.080]   "so that the waves of the sea were hushed.
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:37.120]   "Then they were glad, because they were quiet,
[00:41:37.120 --> 00:41:40.600]   "so he guided them to their desired haven."
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.600]   Now, you can see why the theologians would read this
[00:41:43.600 --> 00:41:46.940]   and say, "This must be reference to this event."
[00:41:46.940 --> 00:41:49.180]   Now, whether you believe it or not,
[00:41:49.180 --> 00:41:53.860]   there are so many references that relate to this,
[00:41:53.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   that Christ himself was revealing himself to the disciples,
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:04.100]   that he is completely sovereign, even over the storm.
[00:42:05.100 --> 00:42:06.980]   Paul says in Colossians 1:16-17,
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:09.120]   "For by him all things were created,
[00:42:09.120 --> 00:42:11.860]   "both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:42:11.860 --> 00:42:14.640]   "whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority,
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:17.500]   "all things have been created through him and for him.
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:19.560]   "He is before all things, and in him
[00:42:19.560 --> 00:42:22.260]   "all things hold together."
[00:42:22.260 --> 00:42:25.500]   All things hold together.
[00:42:25.500 --> 00:42:29.020]   You know, we have a tendency to come
[00:42:29.020 --> 00:42:30.700]   and declare his sovereignty,
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:32.500]   and that he is Lord, he's a creator.
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   We know this passage.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:35.600]   How many times have you read this passage?
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.300]   But do you actually believe this?
[00:42:39.300 --> 00:42:44.380]   Do you actually believe that no matter what is happening,
[00:42:44.380 --> 00:42:46.700]   no matter what kind of circumstance or storms
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:48.360]   may be coming into your life,
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:50.980]   that he is absolutely sovereign?
[00:42:50.980 --> 00:42:56.220]   All authority in heaven and on earth has been given to him.
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:43:00.320]   Even the storm, he says, "Stop!"
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:04.740]   And it is, immediately it obeys, and it stops.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.160]   How often do we declare his sovereignty,
[00:43:09.160 --> 00:43:10.640]   his lordship over our lives,
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:13.860]   but as soon as something that we planned doesn't go,
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:15.280]   soon as something that we thought
[00:43:15.280 --> 00:43:17.240]   was going to go a certain way and it doesn't go,
[00:43:17.240 --> 00:43:20.400]   we begin to say, we begin to get anxious.
[00:43:20.400 --> 00:43:22.840]   We begin to plan, we begin to change plans,
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.520]   we begin to make decisions
[00:43:24.520 --> 00:43:26.800]   that oftentimes leads us away from God.
[00:43:28.920 --> 00:43:30.640]   These disciples needed to know,
[00:43:30.640 --> 00:43:36.800]   that they needed to know who was in charge,
[00:43:36.800 --> 00:43:39.120]   that Jesus was not just a superhuman,
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.840]   Jesus was not just a great messiah,
[00:43:42.840 --> 00:43:46.200]   that this is the son of God that is on the boat,
[00:43:46.200 --> 00:43:51.420]   that even the waves, even the storm obeys him.
[00:43:51.420 --> 00:43:52.640]   They needed to know this.
[00:43:52.640 --> 00:43:55.120]   Now, at this particular moment,
[00:43:56.040 --> 00:43:59.120]   the only testing that they know was the storm,
[00:43:59.120 --> 00:44:02.360]   what greater storm is going to be coming.
[00:44:02.360 --> 00:44:07.560]   Jesus was preparing them for his way to the cross,
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:11.780]   and they needed to know who was in charge.
[00:44:11.780 --> 00:44:18.400]   We can understand him rebuking the wind, and it stops,
[00:44:18.400 --> 00:44:22.200]   but the question is, why does he rebuke the disciples?
[00:44:23.640 --> 00:44:27.000]   How many of you would be in that situation?
[00:44:27.000 --> 00:44:29.600]   And you say, don't worry, don't worry, Jesus is here.
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.680]   But we're about to drown, the water is actually coming in,
[00:44:33.680 --> 00:44:36.120]   you know, we're literally minutes away from drowning.
[00:44:36.120 --> 00:44:38.280]   He's like, hey, hey, hey, kick back, don't worry,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:39.120]   I have faith.
[00:44:39.120 --> 00:44:43.080]   Every single one of us would react
[00:44:43.080 --> 00:44:45.100]   the way that they're reacting.
[00:44:45.100 --> 00:44:48.480]   We can relate to them, and yet Jesus rebukes them,
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:52.160]   so we need to dig a little further.
[00:44:52.160 --> 00:44:54.280]   Why were they rebuked?
[00:44:54.280 --> 00:44:56.840]   Well, Luke 8.25, it says, and he said to them,
[00:44:56.840 --> 00:44:59.160]   "Where is your faith?"
[00:44:59.160 --> 00:45:01.280]   Their reaction was a revelation
[00:45:01.280 --> 00:45:03.440]   of where they were in their faith.
[00:45:03.440 --> 00:45:05.640]   Again, in Matthew 8.26, he said to them,
[00:45:05.640 --> 00:45:09.040]   "Why are you afraid, you men of little faith?"
[00:45:09.040 --> 00:45:12.640]   So what he saw in there was that their fear
[00:45:12.640 --> 00:45:15.320]   revealed where they were in their faith.
[00:45:15.320 --> 00:45:18.680]   In fact, Jesus says this repeatedly over and over again
[00:45:18.680 --> 00:45:21.760]   in Matthew 6.26, he said, "Why are you so concerned
[00:45:21.760 --> 00:45:24.660]   "about what you're gonna eat and where you're going to live?
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.440]   "It's because you have little faith."
[00:45:26.440 --> 00:45:31.280]   Matthew 14.31, when Peter says, "Is that you, Jesus,
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:34.160]   "in the middle of walking in the lake?"
[00:45:34.160 --> 00:45:36.720]   And when the storm came, Peter begins to sink,
[00:45:36.720 --> 00:45:39.920]   and Jesus reaches out and pulls him out of the water,
[00:45:39.920 --> 00:45:43.380]   and he says, "You of little faith, why did you doubt?"
[00:45:43.380 --> 00:45:46.520]   Matthew 17.19-20, people come to him and say,
[00:45:46.520 --> 00:45:49.760]   "Your disciples couldn't cast out these demons."
[00:45:49.760 --> 00:45:51.840]   And Jesus says, "Couldn't cast out demons
[00:45:51.840 --> 00:45:54.120]   "because you had little faith."
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.120]   And then in Luke 7.9, when the centurion
[00:45:57.120 --> 00:45:59.720]   asked Jesus to heal his servant,
[00:45:59.720 --> 00:46:02.160]   and Jesus said, "Where is he, let me go."
[00:46:02.160 --> 00:46:05.240]   He says, "You don't need to come because I have servants,
[00:46:05.240 --> 00:46:06.680]   "and I tell them to go, and they go,
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:07.900]   "I tell them to come, and they come,
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:08.940]   "and I know you have servants.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:10.920]   "Just send one of your servants."
[00:46:10.920 --> 00:46:15.320]   And Jesus says he was amazed by their faith.
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:18.380]   Repeatedly over and over again,
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:21.060]   Jesus is trying to strengthen their faith.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.600]   And in order to strengthen their faith,
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:26.080]   they need to know who Jesus is.
[00:46:26.080 --> 00:46:30.080]   Not just in theory, there's a huge difference
[00:46:30.080 --> 00:46:34.180]   between knowing Christ because you learned it from a book,
[00:46:34.180 --> 00:46:39.120]   because you heard a sermon, because you wrote and it said,
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:41.300]   "Oh, these are the attributes of Jesus.
[00:46:41.300 --> 00:46:43.940]   "This is who he is, he's a sovereign God,
[00:46:43.940 --> 00:46:46.800]   "he is an all-knowing God, he's an omnipresent God."
[00:46:46.800 --> 00:46:51.220]   And you can know all of that, but you know the difference
[00:46:51.220 --> 00:46:54.720]   between having right theology and knowing Christ.
[00:46:54.720 --> 00:47:01.120]   They needed to know, they needed to know who Jesus was.
[00:47:01.120 --> 00:47:05.120]   Hebrews 11, six, it says, "Without faith,
[00:47:05.120 --> 00:47:07.460]   "it is impossible to please him.
[00:47:07.460 --> 00:47:10.180]   "Without faith, it is impossible to please him,
[00:47:10.180 --> 00:47:12.820]   "for he who comes to God must believe that he is,
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:16.340]   "and that he is a rewarder of those who seek him."
[00:47:16.340 --> 00:47:21.340]   It is impossible to please him, meaning that legalism,
[00:47:21.340 --> 00:47:23.640]   just doing the work, just do it.
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.940]   But I sacrifice so much, I've given so much,
[00:47:27.940 --> 00:47:31.220]   I've done so much, I've served so much.
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:32.300]   He says, "No, without faith,
[00:47:32.300 --> 00:47:34.520]   "it is impossible to please him."
[00:47:34.520 --> 00:47:36.780]   If it isn't coming from faith,
[00:47:36.780 --> 00:47:39.180]   if worship isn't coming from faith,
[00:47:39.180 --> 00:47:41.180]   faith meaning if it isn't coming
[00:47:41.180 --> 00:47:43.380]   from genuinely knowing Christ,
[00:47:45.340 --> 00:47:47.180]   no amount of yelling, no amount of screaming,
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.220]   no amount of discipline can please him.
[00:47:50.220 --> 00:47:54.940]   He who comes to God must first believe that he is,
[00:47:54.940 --> 00:47:57.620]   he is, and he is the rewarder
[00:47:57.620 --> 00:47:59.980]   of those who diligently seek him.
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:03.320]   So we know that it says that they were rebuked
[00:48:03.320 --> 00:48:04.620]   because of their faith.
[00:48:04.620 --> 00:48:09.180]   But what is it about their faith that was lacking,
[00:48:09.180 --> 00:48:10.380]   that Jesus rebuked them?
[00:48:11.980 --> 00:48:15.940]   What human being would not be rebuked in this situation?
[00:48:15.940 --> 00:48:20.580]   I want to read a text in Psalm 23, one through five,
[00:48:20.580 --> 00:48:23.300]   a text that all of us are very familiar with.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:25.100]   If you grew up in a Christian home,
[00:48:25.100 --> 00:48:27.220]   you might have a sign, right,
[00:48:27.220 --> 00:48:30.700]   that Psalm 23 even hanging on your wall, right?
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.940]   Even non-Christians know this.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.540]   It says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want."
[00:48:36.540 --> 00:48:37.980]   Let me stop right there.
[00:48:37.980 --> 00:48:41.180]   "The Lord is my shepherd."
[00:48:41.180 --> 00:48:45.340]   I know we say that, we sing that, but is it true?
[00:48:45.340 --> 00:48:48.060]   Is it actually true?
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:50.540]   To say that the Lord is my shepherd
[00:48:50.540 --> 00:48:53.780]   means that he's my protector, he's my provider.
[00:48:53.780 --> 00:48:55.580]   He's my all, and that's why he says,
[00:48:55.580 --> 00:48:59.240]   "The Lord is my shepherd, and I shall have not,
[00:48:59.240 --> 00:49:02.580]   "I have no want," meaning I don't need anything else.
[00:49:02.580 --> 00:49:03.500]   Is that true?
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:07.780]   I know we say it, I know we sing it,
[00:49:08.660 --> 00:49:11.300]   and it's a beautiful verse that gives us comfort,
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.460]   but is it true?
[00:49:12.460 --> 00:49:15.100]   Because everything else he says after that
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:17.980]   is contingent upon that being true.
[00:49:17.980 --> 00:49:22.980]   Because if that's an empty confession,
[00:49:22.980 --> 00:49:26.180]   then everything else that he says in Psalm 23
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:28.020]   is not relevant to you and me.
[00:49:28.020 --> 00:49:31.960]   He said, "All of this is true because he is my shepherd,
[00:49:31.960 --> 00:49:34.380]   "and I have no other wants."
[00:49:34.380 --> 00:49:37.900]   So many people declare this.
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:43.820]   And he says, "He is my shepherd, but I want that,
[00:49:43.820 --> 00:49:46.520]   "and I want this, and I want that,
[00:49:46.520 --> 00:49:49.060]   "and we live our life pursuing all these other things.
[00:49:49.060 --> 00:49:50.380]   "I thought the Lord is my shepherd,
[00:49:50.380 --> 00:49:53.220]   "he's supposed to protect me and guide me."
[00:49:53.220 --> 00:49:57.500]   But the problem wasn't with God keeping his promise,
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:01.500]   but is he actually your shepherd?
[00:50:01.500 --> 00:50:04.740]   Is he the one you run to for comfort,
[00:50:04.740 --> 00:50:07.620]   for protection, for sustenance?
[00:50:08.100 --> 00:50:11.700]   Or do you come to him at church to worship him,
[00:50:11.700 --> 00:50:14.840]   but for everything else, you have other avenues?
[00:50:14.840 --> 00:50:20.500]   Oftentimes, we don't actually realize what he means to us
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:24.060]   until we ourselves have exhausted every other possibility,
[00:50:24.060 --> 00:50:26.140]   and we become so desperate
[00:50:26.140 --> 00:50:31.480]   that we recognize what we've already had.
[00:50:31.480 --> 00:50:34.360]   "He is my shepherd, I shall not be in want.
[00:50:34.360 --> 00:50:36.580]   "He makes me lie down in green pastures."
[00:50:36.580 --> 00:50:38.500]   Meaning that he's the one who's going to provide.
[00:50:38.500 --> 00:50:40.020]   He's the one who's going to sustain.
[00:50:40.020 --> 00:50:42.380]   He's the one who's going to comfort.
[00:50:42.380 --> 00:50:46.020]   Because he's my shepherd, he's the one who restores my soul.
[00:50:46.020 --> 00:50:49.000]   Where does the restoration of your soul come from?
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:49.900]   Netflix?
[00:50:49.900 --> 00:50:52.300]   Movies, vacation?
[00:50:52.300 --> 00:50:56.380]   If he's my shepherd, I don't need anything else
[00:50:56.380 --> 00:50:58.180]   because he leads me down green pastures.
[00:50:58.180 --> 00:50:59.700]   He's the one who leads me quiet waters.
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:01.300]   He restores my soul.
[00:51:01.300 --> 00:51:04.020]   He's the one who guides me in the path of righteousness
[00:51:04.020 --> 00:51:05.220]   for his name's sake.
[00:51:05.220 --> 00:51:08.100]   And then he says, "Even though I walk through the valley
[00:51:08.100 --> 00:51:10.060]   "of the shadow of death, I fear no evil,
[00:51:10.060 --> 00:51:12.620]   "for you are with me.
[00:51:12.620 --> 00:51:16.800]   "Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:51:16.800 --> 00:51:18.560]   "You prepare a table before me in the presence
[00:51:18.560 --> 00:51:19.400]   "of my enemies.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.920]   "You have anointed my head with oil.
[00:51:20.920 --> 00:51:23.320]   "My cup overflows."
[00:51:23.320 --> 00:51:28.860]   Everything else that he says under verse one
[00:51:28.860 --> 00:51:31.000]   is contingent upon verse one.
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.700]   You know, I try to look up shadow of death.
[00:51:34.700 --> 00:51:36.460]   Is there a place called shadow of death
[00:51:36.460 --> 00:51:38.300]   that the psalmist is talking about?
[00:51:38.300 --> 00:51:41.860]   And most people believe that this was a metaphor, right?
[00:51:41.860 --> 00:51:45.020]   What the psalmist is saying, that even though
[00:51:45.020 --> 00:51:48.680]   that this path may lead me to death,
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:53.600]   I will not fear any evil because he is with me.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:57.200]   Because he is with me.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.740]   Even though I may be sitting with enemies
[00:52:00.740 --> 00:52:04.580]   whose sole goal is to harm me,
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:06.860]   he prepares a banquet before them,
[00:52:06.860 --> 00:52:09.860]   and I can eat in peace because he is with me.
[00:52:09.860 --> 00:52:11.780]   He has anointed me with oil.
[00:52:11.780 --> 00:52:15.380]   Why is this relevant?
[00:52:15.380 --> 00:52:19.840]   This is connected to the question that I asked.
[00:52:19.840 --> 00:52:22.880]   Why were the disciples rebuked?
[00:52:22.880 --> 00:52:25.440]   And this is my observation.
[00:52:25.440 --> 00:52:32.060]   They needed to prepare for what Jesus ultimately came for.
[00:52:33.120 --> 00:52:35.480]   Everything that Jesus did was to prepare them
[00:52:35.480 --> 00:52:37.480]   for him to go to the cross.
[00:52:37.480 --> 00:52:40.960]   And there's gonna come a time
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:43.280]   where they will have to give their life.
[00:52:43.280 --> 00:52:45.940]   And they have to trust him,
[00:52:45.940 --> 00:52:51.380]   that even if you die, you will live.
[00:52:51.380 --> 00:52:54.200]   He wasn't simply, I don't think,
[00:52:54.200 --> 00:52:56.360]   rebuking them for freaking out.
[00:52:56.360 --> 00:53:01.280]   It's because they were so afraid of death.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:05.880]   And you have to remember that even after this,
[00:53:05.880 --> 00:53:08.240]   they didn't fully understand.
[00:53:08.240 --> 00:53:12.600]   As Jesus was going, and he's telling them about his death,
[00:53:12.600 --> 00:53:15.640]   remember, they were constantly concerned
[00:53:15.640 --> 00:53:17.720]   about, well, how are we going to live?
[00:53:17.720 --> 00:53:20.640]   Who's going to be to the left or to the right?
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:24.760]   Who's going to receive the benefit of your glory
[00:53:24.760 --> 00:53:26.120]   when that happens?
[00:53:26.120 --> 00:53:27.920]   And so even as Jesus was telling them,
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:31.000]   I'm going to die, I'm going to die, I'm going to die,
[00:53:31.000 --> 00:53:32.400]   they didn't hear any of it.
[00:53:32.400 --> 00:53:35.480]   And even after he is buried,
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:38.400]   they don't go to even check because they heard him,
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:39.760]   but they didn't hear him
[00:53:39.760 --> 00:53:42.360]   because it didn't fit into their paradigm.
[00:53:42.360 --> 00:53:50.120]   It says in Luke 8.25 that after Jesus comes a storm,
[00:53:50.120 --> 00:53:53.440]   they were fearful and amazed,
[00:53:53.440 --> 00:53:56.120]   saying to one another, who then is this
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.320]   that he commands even the winds and the water
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:54:00.280]   and they obey him?
[00:54:00.280 --> 00:54:01.880]   Who is this?
[00:54:01.880 --> 00:54:07.240]   That their fear of the storm
[00:54:07.240 --> 00:54:11.560]   was replaced by fear of the Lord.
[00:54:11.560 --> 00:54:14.680]   And that was the whole point.
[00:54:14.680 --> 00:54:17.360]   That was the whole point.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:21.840]   Until the fear of the Lord grips us,
[00:54:21.840 --> 00:54:23.440]   we will live the rest of our lives
[00:54:23.440 --> 00:54:25.720]   in fear of everything else.
[00:54:27.440 --> 00:54:30.040]   Until the fear of the Lord grips us,
[00:54:30.040 --> 00:54:35.080]   fear of not making it, fear of not getting into school,
[00:54:35.080 --> 00:54:37.440]   fear of not raising our children a certain way,
[00:54:37.440 --> 00:54:39.320]   fear of not having money for retirement,
[00:54:39.320 --> 00:54:44.040]   fear of not being able to have enough money to retire,
[00:54:44.040 --> 00:54:48.440]   some other fear, fear of being rejected by our peers.
[00:54:48.440 --> 00:54:53.960]   If the fear of the Lord does not grip us,
[00:54:53.960 --> 00:54:57.880]   every other fear is going to cause us
[00:54:57.880 --> 00:55:01.360]   to make decisions and do things to lead us away from him.
[00:55:01.360 --> 00:55:03.200]   That's exactly what he says.
[00:55:03.200 --> 00:55:05.000]   In Hebrews 2.14-15,
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:07.680]   therefore since the children share in the flesh and blood,
[00:55:07.680 --> 00:55:10.080]   he himself likewise also partook of the same,
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:12.640]   that through death he might render powerless
[00:55:12.640 --> 00:55:15.240]   him who had power of death, that is the devil,
[00:55:15.240 --> 00:55:18.360]   and might free those who through fear of death
[00:55:18.360 --> 00:55:21.760]   were subject to slavery all their lives.
[00:55:22.880 --> 00:55:25.720]   Those of you who know the context of Hebrews,
[00:55:25.720 --> 00:55:27.680]   Hebrews is possibly written to second
[00:55:27.680 --> 00:55:30.520]   and possibly even third generation Christians.
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.960]   They began their walk and they rejoiced
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:33.960]   when they were suffering.
[00:55:33.960 --> 00:55:36.400]   They visited their fellow prisoners
[00:55:36.400 --> 00:55:40.400]   and they were joyfully getting their things confiscated.
[00:55:40.400 --> 00:55:41.920]   They endured through suffering.
[00:55:41.920 --> 00:55:44.680]   But by the time this is being written,
[00:55:44.680 --> 00:55:48.480]   capital punishments was already being carried out.
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:51.120]   Some of the leaders have already been beheaded.
[00:55:51.120 --> 00:55:54.720]   And it looks like what Jesus said was actually coming true,
[00:55:54.720 --> 00:55:57.320]   not only to Jesus and the disciples,
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.520]   but even some of the church members.
[00:55:59.520 --> 00:56:01.800]   And as a result, some of them were dying.
[00:56:01.800 --> 00:56:07.640]   The book of Hebrews was written to people
[00:56:07.640 --> 00:56:10.740]   who were beginning to fall away and compromise
[00:56:10.740 --> 00:56:12.720]   because they were afraid to die.
[00:56:12.720 --> 00:56:16.000]   And the whole book of Hebrews was written
[00:56:16.000 --> 00:56:18.880]   is the supremacy of Christ over all things.
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:23.800]   That even if you die, you will live.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:30.640]   In John 11, 25 to 27, Jesus says at the resurrection
[00:56:30.640 --> 00:56:35.200]   or the resuscitation of Lazarus, he says,
[00:56:35.200 --> 00:56:38.200]   Jesus said to her, I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:56:38.200 --> 00:56:42.440]   He who believes in me will live even if he dies.
[00:56:42.440 --> 00:56:45.520]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.480]   Do you believe this?
[00:56:49.480 --> 00:56:51.520]   Do you believe this?
[00:56:51.520 --> 00:56:54.000]   See, up to that point, the disciples couldn't understand.
[00:56:54.000 --> 00:56:55.480]   What does it mean to die?
[00:56:55.480 --> 00:56:58.840]   They were so focused on living
[00:56:58.840 --> 00:57:01.480]   that as Jesus was going to the cross,
[00:57:01.480 --> 00:57:03.640]   they couldn't understand.
[00:57:03.640 --> 00:57:06.440]   We followed you, we sacrificed, we understand who you are,
[00:57:06.440 --> 00:57:08.040]   but why would you die?
[00:57:08.040 --> 00:57:12.280]   And this fear of death is what caused them to crumble.
[00:57:12.280 --> 00:57:15.000]   It caused them to crumble,
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:17.480]   deny Christ to his face three times.
[00:57:17.480 --> 00:57:21.320]   And it wasn't until Jesus was resurrected from the dead
[00:57:21.320 --> 00:57:24.280]   and he ascended where the lights began to go off.
[00:57:24.280 --> 00:57:26.700]   That's what he means.
[00:57:26.700 --> 00:57:32.880]   That even if we die in Christ, we will live.
[00:57:32.880 --> 00:57:37.360]   So much of the heartache in the Christian community
[00:57:37.360 --> 00:57:39.840]   comes because we're trying so hard to live.
[00:57:39.840 --> 00:57:44.640]   We're trying so hard to live like the rest of the world.
[00:57:44.640 --> 00:57:47.440]   It is our natural instinct 'cause we want to live.
[00:57:47.440 --> 00:57:49.920]   But it's that instinct to want to live
[00:57:49.920 --> 00:57:51.440]   is what's killing us.
[00:57:51.440 --> 00:57:52.640]   And that's why Jesus says,
[00:57:52.640 --> 00:57:56.540]   "He who finds his life will lose it."
[00:57:56.540 --> 00:58:01.860]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:58:01.860 --> 00:58:05.920]   The beginning of our Christian life is repentance.
[00:58:05.920 --> 00:58:07.760]   Repentance is recognizing
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:11.920]   that all that I had before Christ was wrong.
[00:58:11.920 --> 00:58:13.880]   It wasn't about a particular event.
[00:58:13.880 --> 00:58:15.840]   It wasn't just a simple act.
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:18.120]   Who I was and what I followed, what I valued
[00:58:18.120 --> 00:58:21.640]   was all in the context of sin.
[00:58:21.640 --> 00:58:25.000]   So repentance is turning away from my old life to die,
[00:58:25.000 --> 00:58:28.360]   to die to my old self.
[00:58:28.360 --> 00:58:31.460]   So this new life happens when we die.
[00:58:31.460 --> 00:58:35.720]   Sanctification is a growing understanding of this
[00:58:35.720 --> 00:58:37.120]   and dying more.
[00:58:37.120 --> 00:58:38.400]   That's what sanctification is.
[00:58:38.400 --> 00:58:42.560]   It's not becoming more, but it's becoming less.
[00:58:42.560 --> 00:58:46.120]   Glorification is the final destination
[00:58:46.120 --> 00:58:51.120]   of our salvation to when we ultimately fully die.
[00:58:51.120 --> 00:58:55.160]   So this life that Jesus promised us
[00:58:55.160 --> 00:58:57.760]   that he came to give life and give this life abundantly
[00:58:57.760 --> 00:59:00.280]   happens in the context of picking up our cross
[00:59:00.280 --> 00:59:03.840]   and denying ourselves and being hidden in Christ.
[00:59:03.840 --> 00:59:10.620]   The disciples, I believe, were rebuked
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:12.840]   because they did not understand.
[00:59:12.840 --> 00:59:17.000]   They didn't understand what Jesus came to do.
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:22.520]   They did not understand, like many of us,
[00:59:22.520 --> 00:59:27.860]   that the path to better life,
[00:59:27.860 --> 00:59:32.860]   the path to better eternity is to be less, not more,
[00:59:32.860 --> 00:59:37.520]   is to die in Christ.
[00:59:39.300 --> 00:59:43.620]   It is the mistake that we make, like the disciples,
[00:59:43.620 --> 00:59:46.240]   that if I follow Christ, I'll live longer.
[00:59:46.240 --> 00:59:48.700]   If I follow Christ, that maybe he'll answer my prayer,
[00:59:48.700 --> 00:59:51.820]   my marriage will be fixed, my children will be fixed,
[00:59:51.820 --> 00:59:54.500]   and when that happens, we lose confidence in God.
[00:59:54.500 --> 00:59:58.620]   But we miss the whole point from the get-go.
[00:59:58.620 --> 01:00:04.580]   See, when the disciples encountered Christ
[01:00:04.580 --> 01:00:08.060]   and his power and authority, their paradigm shifted.
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:10.300]   Completely shifted.
[01:00:10.300 --> 01:00:12.360]   Who is this?
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:18.580]   Who is this that even the winds and the water obey him?
[01:00:18.580 --> 01:00:23.400]   Who is this that we worship,
[01:00:23.400 --> 01:00:26.980]   that even if we sacrifice, even if we lose,
[01:00:26.980 --> 01:00:30.120]   even if our greatest fear on earth happens,
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:34.780]   what we have in Christ can never be taken away,
[01:00:36.380 --> 01:00:39.800]   that our security in Christ, him as our Abba Father,
[01:00:39.800 --> 01:00:41.200]   can never be crushed.
[01:00:41.200 --> 01:00:47.200]   He who finds his life, who lives his life,
[01:00:47.200 --> 01:00:50.440]   constantly trying to find his life, will lose it.
[01:00:50.440 --> 01:00:55.680]   But he who recognizes, who is this?
[01:00:55.680 --> 01:00:59.760]   Who is this that even if we die, we will live?
[01:00:59.760 --> 01:01:00.880]   Who is this?
[01:01:00.880 --> 01:01:04.320]   The one who comes to recognize this,
[01:01:04.320 --> 01:01:08.000]   believes him, and follows him, will truly live.
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:15.760]   Man, it's so simple and yet so profound.
[01:01:15.760 --> 01:01:19.100]   It's so simple.
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:22.440]   You must die.
[01:01:22.440 --> 01:01:26.740]   You must first embrace death before you can live.
[01:01:26.740 --> 01:01:30.040]   You must embrace nothingness.
[01:01:31.160 --> 01:01:34.780]   That's why for somebody who has met Christ,
[01:01:34.780 --> 01:01:38.760]   when you hear you don't matter, it's not offensive.
[01:01:38.760 --> 01:01:41.680]   It's very freeing.
[01:01:41.680 --> 01:01:44.640]   You don't matter.
[01:01:44.640 --> 01:01:45.560]   It's like what?
[01:01:45.560 --> 01:01:48.680]   All your life, he's like, you're so special,
[01:01:48.680 --> 01:01:50.160]   you're so special.
[01:01:50.160 --> 01:01:52.880]   Then you come to church, you don't matter.
[01:01:52.880 --> 01:01:54.640]   It's 'cause it's about God.
[01:01:54.640 --> 01:01:57.880]   But those who know who he is,
[01:01:57.880 --> 01:01:59.720]   those who have asked the question,
[01:01:59.720 --> 01:02:03.960]   what kind of a man is this that even if we die,
[01:02:03.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   we will live, the path to freedom is death.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:12.120]   Die.
[01:02:12.120 --> 01:02:12.960]   Die first.
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:16.300]   He who comes to me must first pick up his cross
[01:02:16.300 --> 01:02:17.660]   and deny himself.
[01:02:17.660 --> 01:02:22.560]   That you and I may come to understand when he says,
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:25.080]   I have come to give life and give this life abundantly,
[01:02:25.080 --> 01:02:28.600]   that the path to that life is through the cross.
[01:02:29.520 --> 01:02:34.240]   I pray that our church,
[01:02:34.240 --> 01:02:39.240]   because you are 24/7 bombarded with temptations
[01:02:39.240 --> 01:02:40.260]   of this world.
[01:02:40.260 --> 01:02:42.100]   24/7.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:48.460]   And we can easily be deceived that evidence
[01:02:48.460 --> 01:02:50.420]   of God's blessing is your nice house,
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:53.920]   that evidence of God's blessing is many children.
[01:02:53.920 --> 01:02:58.240]   Evidence of God's blessing is a secure future,
[01:02:58.240 --> 01:02:59.200]   a secure job.
[01:02:59.200 --> 01:03:02.360]   That's deception.
[01:03:02.360 --> 01:03:08.040]   Evidence of God's blessing is a clear sight of Christ.
[01:03:08.040 --> 01:03:12.960]   Evidence of God's blessing is whatever leads you
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.420]   to see a clear vision of the glory of Christ.
[01:03:16.420 --> 01:03:20.360]   Because life is found in him and him alone.
[01:03:20.360 --> 01:03:22.840]   Let's pray.
[01:03:23.520 --> 01:03:25.840]   (footsteps)
[01:03:25.840 --> 01:03:33.840]   Father, we bless you and thank you
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:35.440]   for your goodness in our lives.
[01:03:35.440 --> 01:03:40.120]   Open our eyes, Father God, that we may see a clearer
[01:03:40.120 --> 01:03:43.240]   and clearer vision of who you are.
[01:03:43.240 --> 01:03:50.280]   That though we see dimly lit and as a child,
[01:03:50.840 --> 01:03:55.840]   I pray, Father God, that we would have tasted enough
[01:03:55.840 --> 01:03:59.240]   that we would long for the coming of Christ
[01:03:59.240 --> 01:04:01.600]   and that would be our greatest passion in life.
[01:04:01.600 --> 01:04:06.080]   That we may one day see you face to face.
[01:04:06.080 --> 01:04:09.160]   And that we would share the gospel
[01:04:09.160 --> 01:04:12.960]   and that more and more people may have their eyes open
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:13.980]   and come as well.
[01:04:13.980 --> 01:04:19.600]   For that end, call us, rebuke us, challenge us
[01:04:19.600 --> 01:04:23.320]   and encourage us that we may be your ambassadors
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:24.480]   wherever you send us.
[01:04:24.480 --> 01:04:27.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[01:10:10.980 --> 01:10:14.020]   that we would be able to confess
