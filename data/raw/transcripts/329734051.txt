[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.280]   All right, we're looking at Colossians chapter 3, 18 to chapter 4, verse 1.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:11.680]   And let me pray for us and we'll jump right in.
[00:00:11.680 --> 00:00:13.160]   Let's pray.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:18.360]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that we have in you.
[00:00:18.360 --> 00:00:25.320]   Help us to open our eyes, Lord God, to see how privileged we are spiritually and even
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:27.460]   physically, Lord God.
[00:00:27.460 --> 00:00:33.200]   Help us, Lord, to function each day, knowing, Father God, that the most important things
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:40.120]   in our lives have been taken care of in Christ so that we would not focus on temporary things,
[00:00:40.120 --> 00:00:46.800]   Lord God, and have a sense of anxiety and bitterness and struggle, Lord, because of
[00:00:46.800 --> 00:00:48.720]   these temporal things.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:50.920]   We pray for your blessing and greater insight.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:55.120]   I pray that you would stir in us a hungering and thirsting for righteousness that can only
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.800]   be satisfied in pursuing you with all our heart.
[00:00:57.800 --> 00:01:03.600]   I pray that your word would truly come alive, feed us, encourage us, rebuke us, guide us,
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.480]   Lord, that we may be strengthened toward you.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:07.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:14.320]   All right, so the last time I was up here, I shared about investing in a Bible program.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.200]   And so I've gotten a lot of questions about that.
[00:01:16.200 --> 00:01:21.420]   And I told you there's various Bible programs that you can purchase.
[00:01:21.420 --> 00:01:26.240]   If you have a Mac, a lot of the pastors like using the Accordance.
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:32.480]   Some pastors, I mean, if you, typically the Bible program that is pushed to us at seminary
[00:01:32.480 --> 00:01:37.080]   is Logos or Bible Works because it's a lot more comprehensive.
[00:01:37.080 --> 00:01:39.920]   There's a lot more going on in those things.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:41.560]   But I don't recommend those.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.760]   And the reason why I don't recommend it is it's kind of an overkill.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:47.360]   And it slows down your computer because it's so huge.
[00:01:47.360 --> 00:01:51.720]   And because it's complicated, even a lot of the pastors don't like using it.
[00:01:51.720 --> 00:01:55.420]   If you know me, if it takes me more than five seconds to figure it out, I'm probably not
[00:01:55.420 --> 00:01:56.680]   going to use it.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.120]   You know, and that's how I am with the internet.
[00:01:59.120 --> 00:02:01.240]   And so I'm kind of like that with the Bible program.
[00:02:01.240 --> 00:02:04.920]   I've tried using Bible Works and Logos and all that.
[00:02:04.920 --> 00:02:08.840]   And in order for me to get from one screen to another and to do search, I mean, once
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:13.660]   you learn it, I'm sure it's easy, but it took more than five seconds, so I quit.
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:19.080]   The Bible program that I've been using all these years is probably the layperson's version.
[00:02:19.080 --> 00:02:24.440]   I recommended to the church before, but I wanted to just kind of show it to you what
[00:02:24.440 --> 00:02:27.440]   I use.
[00:02:27.440 --> 00:02:30.960]   Bible Study, PC Study Bible.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:32.360]   They do have a Mac version of this.
[00:02:32.360 --> 00:02:35.760]   They didn't have it before, so they should probably change their name.
[00:02:35.760 --> 00:02:37.680]   But it's called PC Study Bible.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:43.280]   And then if you did want to purchase it, I would recommend the lowest version because
[00:02:43.280 --> 00:02:47.720]   the highest version, 95% of that you will never use.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:48.720]   Right?
[00:02:48.720 --> 00:02:54.440]   It's extra stuff like Spurgeon, all of his sermons, his entire life and his prayer and
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:55.880]   everything he's ever said.
[00:02:55.880 --> 00:02:56.880]   Right?
[00:02:56.880 --> 00:02:58.840]   It's all in that program.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:02:59.840]   You don't need that.
[00:02:59.840 --> 00:03:00.920]   You will not refer to that.
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:06.260]   So the basic stuff that you need, most of the stuff you can find online.
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.720]   But again, the problem with online program is it's limited.
[00:03:09.720 --> 00:03:12.900]   And like I said, if it takes more than five seconds to go from one screen and go to another
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:17.880]   website to look something else up, and it adds an extra step that takes you 30 seconds
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:21.280]   to do something, if you're like me, you're probably not going to use it, at least not
[00:03:21.280 --> 00:03:22.280]   often.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.280]   Right?
[00:03:23.280 --> 00:03:25.600]   But this Bible program is very simple to use.
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.040]   You just need to open it up.
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:33.320]   So let's say if I'm looking at the text that we're looking at, Colossians 3, 21, it's already
[00:03:33.320 --> 00:03:34.320]   up there.
[00:03:34.320 --> 00:03:35.320]   It'll pop up the screen.
[00:03:35.320 --> 00:03:36.320]   Okay.
[00:03:36.320 --> 00:03:37.320]   Get rid of that for a second.
[00:03:37.320 --> 00:03:40.900]   And it'll take me to that passage.
[00:03:40.900 --> 00:03:43.960]   And here's all the different translations here.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:45.960]   Now I only use right here.
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:49.960]   NASB, ESV, NIB, New King James and King James version.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.080]   And every once in a while I'll come here and look at the Amplified or Living Version or
[00:03:54.080 --> 00:03:55.320]   something like that.
[00:03:55.320 --> 00:03:59.160]   And then every once in a while I may come down here and do some Greek study down here.
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:02.520]   But again, that's not something that you need to worry about.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:03.520]   Okay.
[00:04:03.520 --> 00:04:09.960]   So I pop up the NASB version, and we're looking at verse 18 through chapter 4, verse 1.
[00:04:09.960 --> 00:04:14.440]   And so this is where I start my study.
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:18.640]   The button down here will add different screens.
[00:04:18.640 --> 00:04:19.640]   Right?
[00:04:19.640 --> 00:04:25.680]   So now I have NASB, ESV, NIB, and the King James version on one screen.
[00:04:25.680 --> 00:04:29.480]   So while I'm reading it, I can tell which words are used differently.
[00:04:29.480 --> 00:04:34.040]   Now I can change the screen based upon, let's say, instead of using the ESV, I click that
[00:04:34.040 --> 00:04:42.240]   one and I want to see the Living Translation.
[00:04:42.240 --> 00:04:44.160]   And that one will turn into the Living Translation.
[00:04:44.160 --> 00:04:48.880]   So whatever translations I want up on the screen, and I can add as many as I want.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.480]   Right?
[00:04:50.480 --> 00:04:52.000]   Okay.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   Which is completely unnecessary.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   [laughter]
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.960]   But I'm just telling you what this thing is capable of doing.
[00:04:57.960 --> 00:05:01.760]   So after I do that, okay, obviously this in and of itself is a huge help.
[00:05:01.760 --> 00:05:07.040]   But one of the key things that I use probably along with every time this Bible is open,
[00:05:07.040 --> 00:05:11.000]   I usually have this particular study right here, Complete Word Study.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:13.400]   Last time I told you about the Vine, right?
[00:05:13.400 --> 00:05:14.760]   The Vine Word Study.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   That's not the only one.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:22.680]   There's a lot of word study, like word study study concordances that you can get.
[00:05:22.680 --> 00:05:23.680]   Vine is not the only one.
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:27.560]   Vine just happened to be around the longest, and it's kind of like the standard that everybody
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   uses.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:33.600]   The one that this particular program was pushing was the Complete Word Study of the New Testament
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:35.640]   and the Old Testament.
[00:05:35.640 --> 00:05:38.520]   So when I have the Old Testament up, it gives me the option to click this.
[00:05:38.520 --> 00:05:39.520]   So let's say if I...
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:42.280]   Let me get rid of all these screens.
[00:05:42.280 --> 00:05:46.080]   And I wanted to add the Word Study.
[00:05:46.080 --> 00:05:52.360]   I would just come here and click that, and that pops up.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.600]   So when that pops up, if I wanna see, like, okay, what is the Greek word?
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:05:59.240]   And again, you don't have to know the Greek to be able to know this.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:01.520]   I click the numbers here.
[00:06:01.520 --> 00:06:05.240]   These numbers are the strong numbers, those of you guys who know what it is.
[00:06:05.240 --> 00:06:08.040]   You just click that, and it'll give me the definition.
[00:06:08.040 --> 00:06:13.800]   "Goune," and it'll give me the various verses that that word is used, how it's used, what
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:17.180]   is the synonym, what is the antithesis.
[00:06:17.180 --> 00:06:23.580]   And then, over here to the left, when I am on this screen, it gives me other options.
[00:06:23.580 --> 00:06:27.320]   So if I wanted to go to, you know, New English...
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:29.000]   Let me see.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   Sorry.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.400]   If I'm here, Exegetical Dictionary, Thayer's Greek Lexicon, Theological Dictionary of the
[00:06:36.400 --> 00:06:39.280]   New Testament, and Kittel, that's kind of like the standard.
[00:06:39.280 --> 00:06:43.320]   These are things that I've added so that I can go deeper into the Greek, but I'm assuming
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:45.080]   that most of you guys won't need that.
[00:06:45.080 --> 00:06:50.960]   But again, so if you want to know what word is being used, how it's being used, you know,
[00:06:50.960 --> 00:06:54.360]   what other verses use this, it's very helpful.
[00:06:54.360 --> 00:07:01.280]   Now, why this is important, or why I think this would be very helpful, let's say the
[00:07:01.280 --> 00:07:04.160]   word "submit" here, right?
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:07.960]   I pop this up, and it gives me the understanding of this word.
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:13.320]   And to place in order, to place under in an orderly fashion, I mean, we knew that, right?
[00:07:13.320 --> 00:07:17.080]   And then it'll kind of give you the definition, it'll give you more of the background, you
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:22.760]   know, the context, historically, culturally, how they use this term, where other places
[00:07:22.760 --> 00:07:25.140]   in the Bible is this word used.
[00:07:25.140 --> 00:07:29.240]   But what's interesting is, in the Greek, obviously, you're not going to be able to go in, in the
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:31.080]   English, you're not going to be able to go in this deep.
[00:07:31.080 --> 00:07:38.520]   But as we continue to study, the word for "obey" and "submit," they're different words,
[00:07:38.520 --> 00:07:39.520]   right?
[00:07:39.520 --> 00:07:43.880]   So you go here, obviously, here, obviously the number is different, so you're going to
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:45.360]   be able to see that.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:48.600]   Where am I?
[00:07:48.600 --> 00:07:49.920]   See?
[00:07:49.920 --> 00:07:55.640]   The other one was "hupotaso," this one is "hupakuo."
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:07:59.880]   So "hupo" basically means to place under, but then the second part is a bit different.
[00:07:59.880 --> 00:08:11.680]   But if you notice here, the difference between "yi" to "obey" and "submit," let me see.
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:19.920]   Okay, so if you look at the second definition, to yield to a superior command or force without
[00:08:19.920 --> 00:08:22.440]   necessarily being willing.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:24.120]   Just more of a military command.
[00:08:24.120 --> 00:08:30.160]   So the word to obey children, again, and then for slaves to obey the master, is a much stronger
[00:08:30.160 --> 00:08:33.240]   word than the word "submit" for the wife.
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:38.720]   The word "submit" for the wife also has the understanding of to submit and to place under,
[00:08:38.720 --> 00:08:45.960]   but it has the idea of to place under in an orderly fashion, to place in a way that God
[00:08:45.960 --> 00:08:47.560]   has designed.
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:54.920]   So both words have the same significance, to place under, but the thrust of the word,
[00:08:54.920 --> 00:08:58.600]   the strength of the word is very different between "submit" and "obey."
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:08:59.920]   And you can see why.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:05.680]   Between husband and wife, where they are in a sense partnering together, but in the order
[00:09:05.680 --> 00:09:10.840]   of the family, God has placed the husband to lead and the wife to be the one who submits
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:17.160]   and honors the husband, where in between children and parents, it says to obey.
[00:09:17.160 --> 00:09:20.560]   And obey basically means whatever they tell you to do, you're supposed to do.
[00:09:20.560 --> 00:09:21.840]   It's more of a military command.
[00:09:21.840 --> 00:09:24.760]   Same thing with slaves and master, that when the master tells you to do something, you're
[00:09:24.760 --> 00:09:25.840]   supposed to obey.
[00:09:25.840 --> 00:09:32.680]   Where for wives, they are called to submit, generally to honor and to lift up, and to
[00:09:32.680 --> 00:09:34.180]   respect.
[00:09:34.180 --> 00:09:39.640]   So that kind of stuff are things that you'll be able to get if you have access to something
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:40.920]   like this.
[00:09:40.920 --> 00:09:44.880]   Where in the English, you'll read that and say, "Well, it says obey and it says submit."
[00:09:44.880 --> 00:09:48.240]   It also gives you that same idea, but you're not going to be able to dig this far.
[00:09:48.240 --> 00:09:50.220]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:09:50.220 --> 00:09:53.200]   So would this be beneficial to you?
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:54.960]   Absolutely.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:10:00.340]   You'll be able to go a lot deeper, and you don't need to have all the Greek declensions
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.780]   memorized for you to be able to access all of this.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.980]   And then, as you're studying, you find out, "Oh, there's another study that would be helpful."
[00:10:08.980 --> 00:10:13.680]   You can always add to the program, get the basic, and then you just buy $30 program,
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:17.460]   and it'll just add to this, and then it'll show up to the left.
[00:10:17.460 --> 00:10:22.740]   So let's say if I'm doing this, and I wonder what MacArthur thinks about this, and I come
[00:10:22.740 --> 00:10:32.020]   to the commentary section, and it'll say, "And this is MacArthur's notes."
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.980]   So this is his commentary on that particular verse.
[00:10:34.980 --> 00:10:39.300]   If I wanted to go and look at Adam Clark's, right?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:43.300]   These are old guys, not alive anymore.
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.980]   But if I wanted to know what they have to say, and then if I...
[00:10:45.980 --> 00:10:53.380]   You can choose to add more commentaries that you want that this particular study Bible
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:54.380]   gives you access to.
[00:10:54.380 --> 00:10:56.940]   So I have puppet commentary, Wearsby commentary.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.020]   So all these commentaries, I would say about two-thirds of these came with this program,
[00:11:01.020 --> 00:11:03.860]   but right now I have the highest version, so you're not gonna have access to all of
[00:11:03.860 --> 00:11:04.860]   this.
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:09.540]   But as I told you, 95% or more of this stuff, you're not gonna access.
[00:11:09.540 --> 00:11:11.820]   I don't access it, so you're not gonna access it.
[00:11:11.820 --> 00:11:15.980]   Most of the stuff I end up accessing are the ones that I purchased separately, 'cause most
[00:11:15.980 --> 00:11:19.540]   of this stuff are stuff that you can find online if you took some time.
[00:11:19.540 --> 00:11:22.040]   So if I wanna look at a commentary, that's what it says.
[00:11:22.040 --> 00:11:25.100]   If I'm interested in a concordance, right?
[00:11:25.100 --> 00:11:27.980]   What's the word?
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:32.620]   Let's say "submit," or let's say "wives."
[00:11:32.620 --> 00:11:39.900]   And this is all the different places in the Bible where the English word "wives" are used.
[00:11:39.900 --> 00:11:40.900]   And that's how I...
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:47.740]   Like, if you wanted to do a study on submission, like today, where else in the Bible does that
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:48.740]   word "submit"...
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:51.580]   Did I type it right?
[00:11:51.580 --> 00:11:54.380]   Or the "submit," and where is it being used?
[00:11:54.380 --> 00:11:57.660]   And so it'll come up so I can go and look at all these verses in the context and see
[00:11:57.660 --> 00:11:59.860]   how that word is being used.
[00:11:59.860 --> 00:12:07.260]   If I wanted to study the topic, I just choose one of them, and it'll give me...
[00:12:07.260 --> 00:12:08.260]   That's subscription.
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:09.260]   Did I type that right?
[00:12:09.260 --> 00:12:10.260]   Okay.
[00:12:10.260 --> 00:12:11.260]   Let's choose another one.
[00:12:11.260 --> 00:12:12.260]   "Love."
[00:12:12.260 --> 00:12:30.940]   So it'll give me a comprehensive understanding of the term "love," the definition, the Greek
[00:12:30.940 --> 00:12:36.060]   use of it, and all of this, like the historical, cultural context.
[00:12:36.060 --> 00:12:40.300]   So I'm not gonna go through all of these things, but I'm just telling you that everything that
[00:12:40.300 --> 00:12:44.660]   you would need to access is instantaneous.
[00:12:44.660 --> 00:12:49.340]   Like I told you before, if I wanted to find out, do a deeper study on a particular word,
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:53.940]   I would have to go to the library, go through the Dewey Decimal System, go find the reference
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:57.980]   library, gather all those books, and then if I have a question while I'm studying, I
[00:12:57.980 --> 00:13:01.900]   have to go look it up and then write that thing down on a piece of paper, have it next
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:03.380]   to me as I'm studying it.
[00:13:03.380 --> 00:13:05.660]   I would add that to my notes.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:14.780]   But now, I just have the screen open.
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:21.180]   I just have Colossians open and as I am studying it, it was like, "Oh, I wonder how the word
[00:13:21.180 --> 00:13:27.260]   husband or wives or the word embittered, like what does he mean by embittered?"
[00:13:27.260 --> 00:13:29.420]   Verse 19.
[00:13:29.420 --> 00:13:36.060]   "To make bitter," but if you look at the other translations, how does your translation translated
[00:13:36.060 --> 00:13:37.060]   that?
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:38.060]   Huh?
[00:13:38.060 --> 00:13:39.060]   "Do not be harsh."
[00:13:39.060 --> 00:13:40.300]   Right?
[00:13:40.300 --> 00:13:41.300]   So let me go back.
[00:13:41.300 --> 00:13:42.300]   Okay.
[00:13:42.300 --> 00:13:43.300]   I'm gonna go backwards.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:54.500]   I want you to see how this is translated and how just having the different translations
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:55.500]   open.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:14:02.340]   So if you look at verse 19, right, what do you see as the difference between the way
[00:14:02.340 --> 00:14:08.500]   NASB was translated versus the other versions?
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   Tell me if you notice.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:14.500]   Huh?
[00:14:14.500 --> 00:14:21.500]   I didn't get that.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:24.900]   Say it again.
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:28.660]   What do you see the distinction between that translation and the other translation, verse
[00:14:28.660 --> 00:14:32.660]   19, the end part?
[00:14:32.660 --> 00:14:34.660]   Huh?
[00:14:34.660 --> 00:14:36.660]   NASB.
[00:14:36.660 --> 00:14:38.660]   Portion?
[00:14:38.660 --> 00:14:58.660]   I'm missing something.
[00:14:58.660 --> 00:15:03.380]   NASB says, "Husbands, love your wives and do not be embittered against them."
[00:15:03.380 --> 00:15:08.140]   ESB says, "Husbands, love your wives and do not be harsh with them."
[00:15:08.140 --> 00:15:12.900]   But what part is missing?
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:18.500]   Am I the one?
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:24.500]   Verse 19.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:28.500]   Okay.
[00:15:28.500 --> 00:15:32.500]   Okay.
[00:15:32.500 --> 00:15:36.500]   Okay.
[00:15:36.500 --> 00:15:37.500]   Okay.
[00:15:37.500 --> 00:15:43.640]   I just didn't understand the first part. Oh, so you look at a different first okay
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:50.000]   okay all right so if you look at verse 19 ESV says or NISB says do not be
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:55.160]   embittered against them. So where's the action taking place? It's a prohibition
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:05.280]   against who? The husband, not to have certain feelings toward his wife. Yes, is
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:11.520]   that how you read it? In the NIV, in the ESV, it says do not be harsh against them.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.200]   Don't treat them a certain way. Application may not may be the same but
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:25.240]   how it's written is very different. Yes? Yes or no? Okay some of you guys are
[00:16:25.240 --> 00:16:33.060]   paying attention other people are not. Okay all right so you do you see why
[00:16:33.060 --> 00:16:40.760]   that's different? Because one command is commanding the husband to correct what
[00:16:40.760 --> 00:16:47.400]   he's feeling. The other one is correct what he's doing to her. Right? Now the
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.200]   literal translation is more for the NISB. Right? If you look at King James
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:57.800]   version verse 19, do not be bitter toward them. Right? That's exactly like
[00:16:57.800 --> 00:17:05.320]   literally and let's go back let's see if we were to go here to the word study
[00:17:05.320 --> 00:17:11.360]   verse 19. It says husbands love your wives and be not bitter against them.
[00:17:11.360 --> 00:17:16.820]   That's exactly how it's written in the Greek. Okay but obviously what the NIV
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:21.520]   and ESV has done is they taken that and interpreted right and put it into words
[00:17:21.520 --> 00:17:26.200]   that they felt like this that was the spirit of this verse. Right? The spirit
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:30.960]   of this verse is don't treat your wives in this way. So if a husband is in bitter
[00:17:30.960 --> 00:17:35.440]   toward his wife how is he going to act it out? He's gonna be harsh against her
[00:17:35.440 --> 00:17:41.080]   but that's not the prohibition here. The prohibition is against him. Don't harbor
[00:17:41.080 --> 00:17:47.080]   these feelings toward her. Right? Okay now this is why we switch to an ASB. All
[00:17:47.080 --> 00:17:52.840]   right so it's more literal. Now sometimes the ESV does a better job I'm not saying
[00:17:52.840 --> 00:17:56.680]   that all the time that's like that but I think overall percentage and ASB just
[00:17:56.680 --> 00:18:01.040]   tries to stick closer to the original text and then not. Okay so don't find the
[00:18:01.040 --> 00:18:04.400]   verse when you say this is a little bit more literal. Yes there are some verses
[00:18:04.400 --> 00:18:08.120]   that are a bit more literal in the ESV than the NASB but like I said in overall
[00:18:08.120 --> 00:18:13.600]   I found the NASB tries to stick to it a bit closer. Okay so I wanted to just show
[00:18:13.600 --> 00:18:19.720]   this to you because I'm trying to get you to invest. Right? Like I said skip a
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:24.960]   couple lollipops you know and don't go out and get an expensive meal because it
[00:18:24.960 --> 00:18:28.640]   is not that expensive. It's under a hundred bucks for the basic stuff. Right?
[00:18:28.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   Just one year of non Disneyland will get you this and then some. Okay? I don't hate
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:45.360]   Disneyland. I love PC study Bible. All right. All right so like I said I when I
[00:18:45.360 --> 00:18:51.880]   study preparing for sermon or Bible study of any kind like I'm I spend 90
[00:18:51.880 --> 00:18:56.160]   percent of my time in front of this. Just going through verses sifting through
[00:18:56.160 --> 00:19:00.320]   reading the material and then I put it together like the way I do it is I put
[00:19:00.320 --> 00:19:05.440]   it up together on paper. I do this on a piece of paper. Right? The other passes
[00:19:05.440 --> 00:19:08.200]   are more proficient with the computer so they do it on their computer but I
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:12.360]   started doing Bible study on piece of paper and so I think better when I do it
[00:19:12.360 --> 00:19:16.520]   on paper. I usually do this write it all down find all my findings and then I
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:20.760]   organize it and then put it in an orderly like a fashion and then I put it
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:26.960]   back onto the computer. That's the way I do it. Right? But 90% or 95% of the time
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:32.080]   I'm in front of this. The reason why I never switched to Mac is solely because
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.360]   of this. Because they didn't have a Mac version. I got so used to studying the
[00:19:36.360 --> 00:19:41.920]   Bible this way and if I use a Mac I have to get like a parallel program to have
[00:19:41.920 --> 00:19:45.960]   the Mac mirror this and just at that time it's just the transition wasn't
[00:19:45.960 --> 00:19:50.040]   good. I tried it for a while and it just wasn't good. That's the only reason I
[00:19:50.040 --> 00:19:55.480]   know I am not like a you know Mac hater and or PC is better or one way or the
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:58.920]   other. It would be easier for me to use a Mac because everybody else uses Mac so
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:03.440]   it's easier to kind of integrate. But it's for this reason. But they do have a
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:07.560]   Mac version now. It's only been like two years that they came out but I've been
[00:20:07.560 --> 00:20:10.600]   using this since I got ordained. So I've been I don't know how many years been
[00:20:10.600 --> 00:20:18.840]   15, 16, 17 years I've been using this. Okay so there are if you are using other
[00:20:18.840 --> 00:20:24.560]   programs or you want to use something more comprehensive I'll bet you every
[00:20:24.560 --> 00:20:29.360]   single one of our pastors they use something else. They because the seminary
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:34.320]   does not recommend this. This is very very basic. But like I said I think for
[00:20:34.320 --> 00:20:38.680]   lay people this is more than enough. Right in fact sometimes if it's too
[00:20:38.680 --> 00:20:44.320]   complicated you end up not using it. So this is very very simple. Right but you
[00:20:44.320 --> 00:20:50.120]   will rarely go beyond this unless you're writing a dissertation on on on some
[00:20:50.120 --> 00:20:55.880]   deep theological issue. You won't need to go beyond this. Okay so if you are
[00:20:55.880 --> 00:21:00.360]   serious about studying the Bible and you want to go deeper you know you're gonna
[00:21:00.360 --> 00:21:03.680]   spend 30 minutes studying the Bible. Might as well spend that 30 minutes
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:11.080]   efficiently and go deeper. Right? A hundred dollars for eternal rewards.
[00:21:11.080 --> 00:21:20.560]   Right? Lollicup out gone forever. Right? So I recommend this. Okay like I said this
[00:21:20.560 --> 00:21:32.360]   is not the only one but this is the one I use. So all right let's
[00:21:33.320 --> 00:21:40.560]   Okay I'm gonna try to go through this in a different way. I found a program that
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:47.240]   will allow me to write on my computer. Oh yeah it took five seconds to download
[00:21:47.240 --> 00:21:53.080]   and that's why I was able to do this. Okay it was very easy. So basically go
[00:21:53.080 --> 00:22:05.680]   here and I take this like that. Oh sorry. Oh yeah highlight.
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:33.440]   See it? I'm very proud of myself. Yes give me that. I'm very condescending and
[00:22:33.440 --> 00:22:45.360]   clapping. Okay all right so just kind of like us to get the structure. Obviously
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:49.600]   you know his primary things that is these are instructions. So last couple
[00:22:49.600 --> 00:22:53.400]   week Pastor Mark did a great job going over the material and basically the
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:59.240]   broad outline of the past two weeks passages to put off and to put on. Right?
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:03.160]   And the Interparities member in chapter one and two it gives us the gospel and
[00:23:03.160 --> 00:23:08.120]   then in light of that the application in chapter four chapter three and four and
[00:23:08.120 --> 00:23:13.600]   then we said that the primary example of that is to put off your old self and put
[00:23:13.600 --> 00:23:17.200]   on the new self and that was kind of like a broad outline and here he has
[00:23:17.200 --> 00:23:22.280]   very practical application because when the Bible talks about being being
[00:23:22.280 --> 00:23:27.520]   sanctified and practicing your faith where is where is it first going to be
[00:23:27.520 --> 00:23:33.200]   practiced? People that you are closest to that's where it's going to be practiced.
[00:23:33.200 --> 00:23:37.040]   So you know these aren't things that you say like you know one day when I become
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:41.360]   a dad I'm gonna be like this and those applications are very easy to apply
[00:23:41.360 --> 00:23:45.840]   because you're not gonna apply it today. Right? Well I'm gonna be so generous when
[00:23:45.840 --> 00:23:50.360]   I have so much money you know that that's an application that's very
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:55.080]   everybody's generous with money that they might have. You know what I mean?
[00:23:55.080 --> 00:23:58.440]   Because you don't have to give it right now. But these this is where the rubber
[00:23:58.440 --> 00:24:02.800]   meets the road. That's why for an elder his proof of his eldership or training
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.920]   ground or where he practices it is with this home first. Right? So if he doesn't
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.880]   manage his household well he's disqualified as an elder because that's
[00:24:10.880 --> 00:24:14.960]   where the rubber meets the road. If he's not practicing his faith at home he
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:19.800]   can't practice his faith at church. And so that's not only unique to Christians
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:24.340]   it's unique I mean to pastors and elders it's also unique to every single person
[00:24:24.340 --> 00:24:28.560]   because that's where you spend most of your time. So if you're a great Christian
[00:24:28.560 --> 00:24:32.680]   outside of your home but in your home you're contentious selfish and you don't
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:38.040]   practice your faith right then you're not practicing sanctification. Right? So
[00:24:38.040 --> 00:24:42.120]   if you're gonna be unselfish you have to first learn how to be unselfish with the
[00:24:42.120 --> 00:24:44.920]   people who are the closest to you which would be your family members whatever
[00:24:44.920 --> 00:24:50.120]   wherever you may be. So he gives instructions to wives, to husbands,
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:25:00.080]   children, fathers, slaves, and then masters. Is there anybody in this room
[00:25:00.080 --> 00:25:08.720]   that doesn't fall into any one of these categories? No. He pretty much covered
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:14.640]   everybody. Right? What's interesting is the word for children is "teknon" and the
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:20.920]   word for children the Bible has a specific word for for child. Right? For
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:27.360]   little one. Right? "Pidea" it's the word for little one. This one children
[00:25:27.360 --> 00:25:32.640]   if there's no age limitation meaning that every single person is a child
[00:25:32.640 --> 00:25:36.720]   because you have parents. Nobody came into this world except for Adam and Eve.
[00:25:36.720 --> 00:25:42.080]   Right? Nobody came into this world without parents and so every single one
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:46.640]   of us some of you may be four of these things or you know three of these things
[00:25:46.640 --> 00:25:49.720]   but every single one of us falls onto one of these categories. So he gives
[00:25:49.720 --> 00:25:59.160]   practical application. Right? Wives be subject. Let me change the color. Be subject to your
[00:25:59.160 --> 00:26:06.040]   husband. Husbands love your wives. Children be obedient to your parents.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:13.600]   Fathers do not exasperate your children. Slaves obey those who are your masters.
[00:26:13.600 --> 00:26:20.720]   The masters be just and fair. And that pretty much covers what he's what he's
[00:26:20.720 --> 00:26:24.800]   saying in this text. Okay? So let's go down and break down quickly. Okay? Because
[00:26:24.800 --> 00:26:30.200]   I've already spent a good deal of time talking about the Bible program and so
[00:26:30.200 --> 00:26:35.760]   "Wives be subject to your husband" and he said the reason behind that it is fitting.
[00:26:35.760 --> 00:26:41.920]   It is appropriate. This is what God has designed. Right? In the home. So it is
[00:26:41.920 --> 00:26:47.240]   fitting in the Lord. In other words it is a representation of who? Christ
[00:26:47.240 --> 00:26:52.960]   himself. This is what he intended. The Bible says that he created Adam for the
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:58.360]   purpose of what? Reflecting his glory and one of the main part of his glory is his
[00:26:58.360 --> 00:27:06.000]   identity. Who is he? He's the triune God. The perfect union between God the Father
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.400]   Son and the Holy Spirit. So even in the relationship between husband even though
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:15.680]   one in essence three in personalities. Right? In the way that they're
[00:27:15.680 --> 00:27:20.200]   functioning. God the Father is the one who initiates. Jesus is the one who
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:26.000]   mediates. Right? And then God the Holy Spirit is the one who executes. And all
[00:27:26.000 --> 00:27:32.360]   three of them together the triune God is God himself. So he says in the home God
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:37.200]   has created although we are humanly all equal. Does God love the husband more
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:41.120]   than the wife? Does wife have less value than the child? They're all human beings.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.920]   They're all reflect the glory of God. No one was created any less than the other
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:49.480]   person. But in the family structure God has created order just like there's
[00:27:49.480 --> 00:27:55.080]   order in the Trinity. Right? And as the son submits to the father and the Holy
[00:27:55.080 --> 00:28:00.080]   Spirit to the others. Right? He calls the wives to be submissive to honor to
[00:28:00.080 --> 00:28:06.660]   reflect because husband is given the role of initiating. To lead. So if you
[00:28:06.660 --> 00:28:11.240]   have a contentious wife who's constantly challenging the husband it what does it
[00:28:11.240 --> 00:28:16.480]   do? It damages what is fitting to the Lord in reflection of his glory. Right?
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:21.680]   And so wives are called to be submissive. And again the word submissive here
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.320]   Hufatasa is the same word used in Ephesians chapter 5 22 and when the
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:30.660]   wives are called to submit to their husbands. Okay? Again like I said this is
[00:28:30.660 --> 00:28:34.040]   a different word than the word that is used for children obeying their parents.
[00:28:34.040 --> 00:28:39.280]   And you don't have to desire it. It is a military term. When the
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.720]   commander says go you go. That is not the term used here. It is more a sense of
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:51.840]   reference. Reverence and honoring. Right? Respecting. Okay? Husbands love your wives
[00:28:51.840 --> 00:28:59.080]   and do not be embittered against them. Again so this is a
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:04.160]   obviously love your wives is how you ought to treat them. In Ephesians
[00:29:04.160 --> 00:29:09.720]   chapter 5 it says ask to your own body. Right? And then in Philippians chapter 2
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:13.480]   we're supposed to consider everyone better than ourselves. Right? So that
[00:29:13.480 --> 00:29:17.380]   would obviously apply to our wives. So what it means to lead. Right? And the
[00:29:17.380 --> 00:29:20.440]   reason why the wife needs to submit to the husband is because the husband is
[00:29:20.440 --> 00:29:26.080]   called to sacrifice. So if you live selfishly, if every decision is kind of
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:29.040]   like you know what last time you got to watch you what you want to watch this
[00:29:29.040 --> 00:29:33.240]   time I get to do what I want. Right? And if you live with that kind of mentality
[00:29:33.240 --> 00:29:38.280]   like you do 50% I do 50% and you have that kind of mentality in your head
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:42.560]   you're not gonna be a good leader. Right? You're not gonna be a good leader because
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:49.040]   what your your mentality is not sacrifice. Sacrifice means that you live
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:54.720]   your life for her benefit. Like even when you have to make authoritative decisions
[00:29:54.720 --> 00:30:00.280]   that she may not like it has to be a decision for her not for you. Right? You
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:03.440]   say well you got to eat out last night so I get to play video games four hours.
[00:30:03.440 --> 00:30:07.380]   You know what I mean? And of course she's gonna have a hard time respecting you if
[00:30:07.380 --> 00:30:11.480]   your life is live self-centered. So the husband is called to sacrificially love
[00:30:11.480 --> 00:30:15.600]   her. It doesn't say sacrificially love here but it's the word agape. You commit
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:19.840]   to her and other parts of the Bible obviously explains what that means. So
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:24.360]   the husband is actually called to do a harder job because you're supposed to
[00:30:24.360 --> 00:30:30.040]   sacrifice for them. Right? So that so that your decisions and your sacrifice
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:35.360]   causes her to love Christ more and so that they could have a better life. Right?
[00:30:35.360 --> 00:30:39.800]   And you and you live for that purpose and if you do that your wife will have
[00:30:39.800 --> 00:30:43.840]   easier time submitting to you. The wives are gonna have a hard time if
[00:30:43.840 --> 00:30:47.560]   the guy that she's submitting to is constantly making decisions for himself
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:54.400]   and then he uses the Bible saying God said to submit. Right? So that doesn't
[00:30:54.400 --> 00:30:59.680]   mean the wives are wives like if your husband is selfish and he's not doing
[00:30:59.680 --> 00:31:04.000]   the right thing that that somehow that disqualifies him to be a leader and you
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.960]   don't have to submit to him. The Bible does not give stipulations as to who to
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.000]   submit. Like if you respect him submit. If you don't respect him don't submit. That's
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:16.920]   the Bible does not. Husbands, wives are called to submit whether you respect the
[00:31:16.920 --> 00:31:20.160]   guy or not. Whether he's being selfish or not. It will be very difficult for you.
[00:31:20.160 --> 00:31:26.920]   Right? But that's what God has called the wives to do. But husbands don't make it
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:34.320]   hard for them to submit by being selfish. By making decisions for yourself. Right?
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:40.480]   Give in as much as you can. Right? Learn to die to yourself at home. Okay? I'm
[00:31:40.480 --> 00:31:44.000]   saying all of this I'm looking straight at Esther. All right.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:50.960]   Back me up Esther. All right. If you don't, if you live selfishly and they have a
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:55.680]   hard time submitting to you, you know, don't throw the Bible at them.
[00:31:55.680 --> 00:32:01.280]   Right? Throw the Bible at yourself first. There's a good reason why they might not
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:05.600]   be, they have a hard time submitting to you because you're using authority for
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:09.720]   selfishness. Right? Children be obedient to parents. Again, the word children
[00:32:09.720 --> 00:32:14.120]   is not referring to young children. At no point. So those of you who are married at
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:18.560]   Berean, you know that in the marriage ceremony we highlight the fact that just
[00:32:18.560 --> 00:32:21.600]   because you're getting married doesn't mean that your responsibility to honor
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:27.720]   and submit to your parents is done. Right? They will always be our parents. They'll
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.480]   always be our parents. That doesn't mean, like, so when you say family, obviously
[00:32:31.480 --> 00:32:35.000]   you're called to submit to your husband, but your attitude toward your parents
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:41.480]   should always be as a child to parent. Right? Now I know what that leads to, and
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:45.720]   that's, that's, I'll leave that to your small group discussion. You know, I know a
[00:32:45.720 --> 00:32:50.000]   lot of you guys have unbelieving parents and their values are very different than
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:56.160]   yours, and, and so I know some groups that will never officiate or never allow a
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:33:02.960]   wedding that either side of the parents are against, like ever. So unless both
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:06.600]   sides of the parents are happy and they're, they're completely like, you know,
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:11.520]   we give you a blessing, they will not officiate the wedding. Right? We don't do
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:17.560]   that at our church, and I can give you, you know, our reasoning behind that, but
[00:33:17.560 --> 00:33:20.000]   again, that's something that I'm gonna ask you guys to take some time to
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:23.800]   discuss in your small group. Right? But general principle, that the general
[00:33:23.800 --> 00:33:28.640]   principle of calling is children are called to be obedient for what? For this
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.760]   is well pleasing to the Lord. Right? The Bible clearly says if there's one
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.080]   commandment out of ten commandments that he highlights, and he says, "Honor your
[00:33:37.080 --> 00:33:40.280]   father and mother if you want to live long and prosperous life in the land."
[00:33:40.280 --> 00:33:44.880]   Right? And he said that, that particular, all the commandments obviously are
[00:33:44.880 --> 00:33:48.160]   important, but that commandment is highlighted to call. If you're gonna
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:52.840]   submit to God and you don't submit to the authority right above you, right, it's
[00:33:52.840 --> 00:33:58.320]   easy to submit to God because he's, he's far off. Right? Just don't read the parts
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.000]   that you don't want from the Bible. So a lot of times when you talk about being
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.240]   obedient to God and you're being disobedient to the authority right above
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:10.800]   you, you are being disobedient to God. He said, "But you're not God." Right? But that's
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.760]   what the scripture says. Right? So if we're gonna practice submission and
[00:34:15.760 --> 00:34:19.920]   obedience, it has to be practiced where the rubber meets the road, for the
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:24.400]   authority in your life. Right? So that's, he said, it is well pleasing to the Lord.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.360]   "Fathers, do not exasperate your children so that they will not lose heart." Okay,
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:33.320]   let's look at that. This, this is a bit different too.
[00:34:33.320 --> 00:34:47.520]   Right? "Fathers, do not exasperate, do not provoke. Fathers, do not embitter." Okay, so
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:50.680]   each one of these translations is a little bit different, but basically it's
[00:34:50.680 --> 00:34:55.320]   to stir them up to anger. Right? I remember the first time looking at this,
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:35:00.760]   when it says, "Do not exasperate your children or provoke them to anger." I
[00:35:00.760 --> 00:35:05.720]   thought, "That was so unfair." You know? You should tell the children to not to
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:11.680]   provoke me. Not the other way. Right? Because typically that's what happens.
[00:35:11.680 --> 00:35:16.720]   Do not provoke your parents to anger. Right? But why does he say this to the
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:24.800]   father? Not to provoke them to anger. Because fathers were given authority.
[00:35:24.800 --> 00:35:29.960]   Right? Especially at this particular time, the children and wives did not
[00:35:29.960 --> 00:35:35.000]   have any rights. So the father can, you know, the idea of being abusive at home,
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:41.920]   you've been laughed at. That's what you're supposed to do. Right? In fact, some cultures today. I told
[00:35:41.920 --> 00:35:46.120]   you the story out in India, that women and children are treated so poorly over
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:50.120]   there. One of the missionaries actually had to give a seminar about not beating
[00:35:50.120 --> 00:35:53.840]   your wives. Not the pastors that we work with, but it was another pastor group
[00:35:53.840 --> 00:35:58.240]   that I was there helping and doing a hermeneutics training with them. And the
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.040]   missionary basically says, "A good Christian, good pastor does not beat his
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:06.080]   wife." And all the Western missionaries, we just chuckled. Because we thought he
[00:36:06.080 --> 00:36:10.520]   was joking. He just kind of threw that in there. And then the response we gave, and
[00:36:10.520 --> 00:36:14.360]   the response of the pastor was very different. They were confused. They raised
[00:36:14.360 --> 00:36:18.120]   their hand and then later on we found out that they were bothered by that. And
[00:36:18.120 --> 00:36:24.200]   one of the pastors went up and asked the missionary, and he asked him, "What if
[00:36:24.200 --> 00:36:28.880]   they don't listen?" And that was a very serious question. So I talked to the
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:34.120]   missionary about that and he said, "It's a big problem in India. Right? That women and
[00:36:34.120 --> 00:36:38.120]   children are treated so poorly, you know, in that country. And
[00:36:38.120 --> 00:36:42.480]   especially in the villages where there's people are uneducated. And so you're
[00:36:42.480 --> 00:36:45.840]   looking at a culture at that particular time where women and children were
[00:36:45.840 --> 00:36:52.440]   treated in the same way. Maybe even more poorly than cultures like that. Right? So
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:56.200]   do not exasperate. Do not provoke your children. It's because the guy has all the
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:37:00.480]   authority. He has the upper hand. And our tendency is, if you have the upper hand,
[00:37:00.480 --> 00:37:05.200]   how do you treat the people who are beneath you? If you really want to see a
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:11.680]   character of a man, see how he treats people that are clearly beneath him. See
[00:37:11.680 --> 00:37:18.160]   how he treats homeless people. See how he treats people who are, you know, beneath
[00:37:18.160 --> 00:37:23.760]   him. Or maybe if you're a store owner, how he treats the employees. Right? You see,
[00:37:23.760 --> 00:37:29.240]   like, once he has power and authority, see how he, what he does with that. Right? So
[00:37:29.240 --> 00:37:33.440]   he's telling fathers, basically, don't wield your authority and power. Right? And
[00:37:33.440 --> 00:37:38.560]   provoking them to anger by basically being abusive. Right? Because he can do it.
[00:37:38.560 --> 00:37:42.360]   He can express his anger and beat them because they bothered him. You know,
[00:37:42.360 --> 00:37:46.200]   there's no consequence, at least in this culture. And that's why he says, do not
[00:37:46.200 --> 00:37:51.080]   exasperate them so that they would not lose heart or be discouraged. Meaning
[00:37:51.080 --> 00:37:55.600]   you're demoralizing them so that they have, you know, so they they're afraid.
[00:37:55.600 --> 00:38:05.040]   Right? So that's why he says to the fathers not to do that. And then, he says,
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:12.000]   slaves, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth. So obviously, the
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.280]   application of this is a bit different than today. Today we could think of it as
[00:38:15.280 --> 00:38:20.080]   employer versus employee. And I think there is a correlation. But the
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:24.880]   difference between the slaves and maybe an employee, the slaves basically did not
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:29.600]   have any rights. Right? The master owned you. Even if you were an indentured
[00:38:29.600 --> 00:38:34.000]   servant for a period of time, during that period, you belong to the master. So the
[00:38:34.000 --> 00:38:39.080]   master had every right over you. Right? So if you had a good master, you'd have a
[00:38:39.080 --> 00:38:42.160]   good life. If you have a bad master, you would be miserable because they would be
[00:38:42.160 --> 00:38:48.920]   able to beat you. You know, senselessly, for any reason. And so it's in that
[00:38:48.920 --> 00:38:56.720]   context, he says, in all things obey those who are your masters on earth. Right? So
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:02.280]   we're not, there is a correlation. But the application of this is much harder than
[00:39:02.280 --> 00:39:06.920]   the application of employee and employer. Okay? So just keep that in mind. There is
[00:39:06.920 --> 00:39:10.840]   a correlation. But he says, obey in all things on earth, not with external
[00:39:10.840 --> 00:39:18.000]   service. Here's one situation where the ESV just took it literally. He says, I
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:24.280]   service. And that's exactly what it means. Right? In other words, just work
[00:39:24.280 --> 00:39:28.480]   hard when you're watching or you're being evaluated. Well, when no one's
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:33.960]   watching, you just kind of do whatever. Right? You take 50-minute bathroom breaks.
[00:39:33.960 --> 00:39:38.640]   You come into work 30 minutes late and leave an hour early. As long as you're
[00:39:38.640 --> 00:39:42.640]   not being watched. And he said, you're basically, as long as the boss is
[00:39:42.640 --> 00:39:47.440]   not watching, you do whatever you want. He says, do not, right, in all things who are
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:50.880]   your masters on earth, not external services as those who merely please men.
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:54.840]   As long as you're working and the only person that you're concerned about are
[00:39:54.840 --> 00:39:58.880]   other men. Right? And as long as they're not watching, you're completely a
[00:39:58.880 --> 00:40:03.560]   different person. And this obviously applies in every situation. Right? If
[00:40:03.560 --> 00:40:08.280]   you're a man pleaser, you're godly at church and ungodly outside. Right? If
[00:40:08.280 --> 00:40:12.360]   you're a man pleaser. And you only perform when there's a lot of people
[00:40:12.360 --> 00:40:15.480]   watching. But when nobody's watching and there's no consequence, you're a
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:18.960]   completely different person. Right? He said, not only externally, but merely
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:26.360]   pleased to please men, but with sincerity of heart. Right? Fearing the Lord.
[00:40:26.360 --> 00:40:38.760]   So in 23 it says, whatever you do, do your work heartily. The word here for
[00:40:38.760 --> 00:40:43.320]   heartily literally is suke. But all the translations translated heartily
[00:40:43.320 --> 00:40:47.200]   because that's the understanding of it. But one of the questions that came up is
[00:40:47.200 --> 00:40:53.120]   is verse 23 and 24, 23, 24, 25, is it speaking about slaves or everybody else?
[00:40:53.120 --> 00:40:57.280]   In this context, it's specifically related to slaves and masters. And the
[00:40:57.280 --> 00:41:03.400]   reason why I say that is because he says not to do it just external service, but
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:09.800]   do your work heartily. Meaning internally. Right? So again, if you look at the
[00:41:09.800 --> 00:41:14.880]   language, it's connected. As the Lord rather than for men. Not to simply be a
[00:41:14.880 --> 00:41:23.920]   man pleaser. It's knowing that, knowing that from the Lord you will receive a
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:28.680]   reward of inheritance. It is the Lord Christ whom you serve. For he who does not, who
[00:41:28.680 --> 00:41:31.920]   does wrong will see the consequence of the wrong which he has done, and that
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:35.280]   without partiality. So another question that came up is when you're talking
[00:41:35.280 --> 00:41:39.200]   about the consequences, is he talking about eternal consequence, heavenly
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:44.720]   consequence, physical consequence? Clearly the Bible says there is no condemnation
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.880]   for those who are in Christ Jesus. He's not talking about salvation, clearly. But
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:53.560]   the book of Hebrews tells us that those who are his children are what? Are
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:42:01.120]   disciplined. Right? So does God discipline sin? Yes. He says that. And he
[00:42:01.120 --> 00:42:04.920]   says he wouldn't be a loving God if he did not discipline us. If he allowed us
[00:42:04.920 --> 00:42:09.320]   to just live in sin without any consequence, it may be proof that you are
[00:42:09.320 --> 00:42:13.400]   not his child. But if you are a child of the sovereign God who loves us, he says
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:17.840]   when we sin, we are disciplined. And that's what he's talking about. So is
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:24.560]   there consequence for sins? Yes. The Bible is clear about that. Okay. And then
[00:42:24.560 --> 00:42:29.000]   finally, masters grant to your slave justice and fairness. Again, so this is in
[00:42:29.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   a context where, right, the masters, because they have all the power, he can
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:42.360]   wield the power that he has unjustly. But he says to the slave be fair. So if
[00:42:42.360 --> 00:42:45.400]   you, if somebody comes in as an indentured servant and you said that in
[00:42:45.400 --> 00:42:49.640]   six years he's going to be released, right, and the master manipulates his
[00:42:49.640 --> 00:42:53.360]   situation saying that, "No, no, you owe me more than this and that." They don't have,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:59.040]   slaves don't have rights to go to court and sue his master. So the master has all
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:02.920]   the power. He owns them for that period. So he's saying to be fair and just,
[00:43:02.920 --> 00:43:08.640]   knowing that you too have a master in heaven. Okay. All right. So I'm going to
[00:43:08.640 --> 00:43:12.640]   end it there and I'm going to ask you guys to take time for your small group
[00:43:12.640 --> 00:43:17.560]   discussion. But let me conclude with this and I'm not going to read it. It's all on
[00:43:17.560 --> 00:43:23.400]   your paper. All of these things, we can talk about it in theory, but if you don't
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:28.640]   practice it where the rubber meets the road, it means nothing. Right. We don't
[00:43:28.640 --> 00:43:33.400]   want to be hearers of the word, but to be doers. So some of the questions that, that
[00:43:33.400 --> 00:43:38.080]   I ask, you know, is asked more specifically about submission. Like if
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:44.200]   you are a wife, are you being submissive? If you are a husband, are you being
[00:43:44.200 --> 00:43:48.600]   sacrificial for your family? Are you being selfish with your time and money?
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.040]   Right. If you're a person in authority, do you have a tendency to exasperate
[00:43:54.040 --> 00:43:58.760]   people because you give full vent, you know, when you're frustrated and you
[00:43:58.760 --> 00:44:03.160]   don't treat people with kindness because they're, they're not, you know, they're
[00:44:03.160 --> 00:44:08.720]   not your equal. Right. If you are, if you are a slave, okay, slave meaning if you're
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:11.680]   an employee, right, and if you're an employee you probably feel like a slave
[00:44:11.680 --> 00:44:18.920]   sometimes. If you're an employee, do you just labor for other people to see? But
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:21.360]   if you don't get caught, you're not a hard worker. So there you're only a hard
[00:44:21.360 --> 00:44:25.160]   worker when there's consequence. Right. Or do, are we really working for the Lord?
[00:44:25.160 --> 00:44:28.960]   Right. Everything that we do, we do it wholeheartedly because we're ultimately
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:32.360]   serving God and it's a way to honor God. Just like we talked about worship, right.
[00:44:32.360 --> 00:44:38.800]   Worship is not just how we sing and how we, how much we give. Worship is how we
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:46.320]   live our life. Right. And majority of you, if you're working, 70% of your life is at
[00:44:46.320 --> 00:44:51.680]   work. So if you're not reflecting Christ at work, you're not reflecting Christ.
[00:44:51.680 --> 00:44:56.720]   Right. You're not, if you're not reflecting your, you know, Christ at home,
[00:44:56.720 --> 00:45:04.120]   which, which where the other 25% is, you're only at church 5% of your life. So
[00:45:04.120 --> 00:45:09.980]   if only 5% you're generous and gracious and loves God and prayer and Bible
[00:45:09.980 --> 00:45:13.680]   study, it's only, if your spiritual life is only contained in that 5% of your
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:19.440]   life, 95% of your life you're being disobedient. 95% of your life you're not
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:24.240]   reflecting Christ. Right. So in your small groups, as we take some time to
[00:45:24.240 --> 00:45:29.120]   discuss, let's go deeper. Instead of just talking about what does this mean? What
[00:45:29.120 --> 00:45:33.080]   does that mean? And all that is important, but this is where the rubber meets the
[00:45:33.080 --> 00:45:39.240]   road. Right. Like this is what it means to live worthy of the gospel. Okay. So let
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:43.320]   me pray first and then I'll give you time for your small group.
[00:45:43.320 --> 00:45:53.280]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word. We thank you for just how
[00:45:53.280 --> 00:45:56.840]   practical your word is, how it judges the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:45:56.840 --> 00:46:03.880]   And I know Father God that in, in one or in many ways, Lord, that these words cut
[00:46:03.880 --> 00:46:10.880]   us and cuts us deeply. We desire to honor you in every way. And, but we pray
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:15.320]   Father God that our motivation would not be other people, that we may not live
[00:46:15.320 --> 00:46:20.440]   simply for eye service, to build a reputation, but truly live a life, Lord
[00:46:20.440 --> 00:46:24.320]   God, worthy of the gospel that you've given us. I pray for your direction in
[00:46:24.320 --> 00:46:28.240]   the small groups, that the discussions would be open and honest, that we may be
[00:46:28.240 --> 00:46:32.600]   able to share our weaknesses, that we may find strength in one another. I pray that
[00:46:32.600 --> 00:46:36.360]   your Holy Spirit would guide and lead us, Lord God, that we may apply these words
[00:46:36.360 --> 00:46:41.760]   practically in our lives. We thank you in Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
