[00:00:02.920 --> 00:00:06.880]   >> Is really about being anchored in Christ.
[00:00:06.880 --> 00:00:11.200]   And I've got the first leg of what it means to be anchored in Christ as
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:13.320]   an individual Christian.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:17.400]   And then Pastor Mark is gonna take that baton in the afternoon and
[00:00:17.400 --> 00:00:22.800]   talk about what it means to be anchored in Christ as a family unit.
[00:00:22.800 --> 00:00:29.160]   And Pastor Peter tomorrow will be sharing with us about how as a church,
[00:00:29.160 --> 00:00:32.040]   we are anchored in Christ.
[00:00:32.040 --> 00:00:39.400]   So why don't we pray and we'll begin just our time of worship.
[00:00:39.400 --> 00:00:41.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:46.840]   Father, we are so thankful that you've gathered us here this morning and
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:49.200]   this weekend here in Palm Desert.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:51.280]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:00:51.280 --> 00:00:56.800]   And I'm sure Lord that there are many of us who really need this time
[00:00:56.800 --> 00:00:59.200]   to just commune with you.
[00:00:59.200 --> 00:01:04.040]   And we are so thankful that you give us a church body where we can
[00:01:04.040 --> 00:01:09.640]   gather together as a family, really to face in the same direction.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:14.560]   And Lord, I pray that we would all leave here facing God and
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:18.120]   Christ for just a little bit more.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.160]   So we pray for your help as we just look at your word, study your word and
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:27.600]   share about how your word is moving in our lives and in our hearts and
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:31.560]   the areas of our lives that we need to bring in submission to your word.
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:37.320]   I do pray that you would help us just to really have ears to hear your truth.
[00:01:37.320 --> 00:01:40.600]   Hear fruit through your truth.
[00:01:40.600 --> 00:01:41.960]   Our greatest things in Jesus name.
[00:01:41.960 --> 00:01:45.000]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:47.800]   I've done a lot of counseling of, I guess,
[00:01:47.800 --> 00:01:51.040]   dating couples over the last several years.
[00:01:51.040 --> 00:01:56.240]   And just a few premarital counseling sessions as well.
[00:01:56.240 --> 00:01:59.800]   And when I do premarital counseling with engaged couples or
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:02.800]   talk to just couples that are dating, looking to get married.
[00:02:02.800 --> 00:02:06.280]   One of the first questions that I ask is this.
[00:02:06.280 --> 00:02:10.280]   I ask them, what is the purpose of marriage?
[00:02:10.280 --> 00:02:11.880]   What is the purpose of marriage?
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.760]   And in each case, there's usually a little bit of a fumbling around and
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:19.240]   a nervous scramble in search for the right answer.
[00:02:19.240 --> 00:02:21.960]   And that's okay, it's not a trick question.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:24.880]   But it throws people off because when a pastor asks it,
[00:02:24.880 --> 00:02:28.960]   it almost seems like you have to give a holy answer.
[00:02:28.960 --> 00:02:34.600]   Usually when a question like this is posed, the couple answers something like,
[00:02:34.600 --> 00:02:38.680]   well, to glorify God by raising a godly family.
[00:02:38.680 --> 00:02:42.360]   It always goes up, cuz you're not a 100% sure.
[00:02:42.360 --> 00:02:45.480]   And that's not an incorrect answer.
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:49.040]   But this is actually a question that's very important.
[00:02:49.040 --> 00:02:55.280]   But one that married people seldom ask themselves.
[00:02:55.280 --> 00:03:00.400]   And because it is not often asked, it is seldom reflected on.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:05.040]   So most of you guys are familiar with marriage.
[00:03:05.040 --> 00:03:07.800]   What is the purpose of marriage?
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:10.720]   And how often do we ask this of ourselves?
[00:03:10.720 --> 00:03:12.080]   And probably not too often,
[00:03:12.080 --> 00:03:16.160]   because we're just trying to survive day to day just doing life together.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:21.720]   And here's another important question that is all too seldom asked.
[00:03:21.720 --> 00:03:24.400]   What is the purpose of my Christian life?
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.600]   What is the purpose of my Christian faith?
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:33.880]   Or in other words, to what purpose or for what purpose have I been saved?
[00:03:33.880 --> 00:03:40.680]   And again, because we seldom ask this of ourselves,
[00:03:40.680 --> 00:03:43.480]   it's seldom reflected upon and we get in trouble.
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:48.360]   So in scripture, the answer to this question is very clear.
[00:03:48.360 --> 00:03:52.000]   But what I wanna do is I wanna ask to actually read Genesis 1-1,
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:57.280]   John 17-3, and then we will look into our Ephesians chapter 2 passage, okay?
[00:03:57.280 --> 00:03:59.560]   Genesis 1-1, you don't need to turn there.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:02.080]   If anything, just keep your finger on Ephesians.
[00:04:02.080 --> 00:04:05.720]   Genesis 1-1, you guys are probably very familiar with this.
[00:04:05.720 --> 00:04:08.680]   In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:12.200]   And you guys know this passage.
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:13.960]   Usually when one year Bible class starts,
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:15.600]   this is the first sentence that's read.
[00:04:15.600 --> 00:04:17.960]   Usually when people try to read through the scripture.
[00:04:17.960 --> 00:04:21.040]   So this is probably the sentence in the Bible that's read the most, okay?
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:27.640]   The gospel of Jesus Christ begins with the creator God of purpose,
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:30.120]   a God who creates everything good.
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:36.120]   So we see in Genesis chapter 1, the word good is used after each of the first five
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:43.360]   days of creation, and the words very good after everything is completed in day six.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:48.560]   So God created everything very good.
[00:04:48.560 --> 00:04:53.480]   In fact, it's not until Genesis 2-18 where the words not good are used to describe
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:59.240]   man's lack of community, his lack of an equal not only to subdue,
[00:04:59.240 --> 00:05:04.200]   but to enjoy all the good that God had created.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:08.000]   So you and I have been created by a very, very good,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:15.440]   creative God who is longing to be good to us.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:19.840]   And this good God has given us the gift of eternal life.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:23.360]   And what does this eternal life entail?
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:24.720]   What does it revolve around?
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:27.520]   I'm gonna just quote to you John 17, 3.
[00:05:27.520 --> 00:05:31.800]   It says, now this is eternal life, that they may know you,
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   the only true God, Jesus Christ, whom you have sent.
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:39.160]   Eternal life is not just about avoiding hell.
[00:05:39.160 --> 00:05:44.440]   Eternal life is about knowing for whom you have been created eternally,
[00:05:44.440 --> 00:05:49.840]   and just being lavished with goodness upon goodness
[00:05:49.840 --> 00:05:53.240]   in the knowledge of God and of his Christ.
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:05:53.960]   Okay?
[00:05:53.960 --> 00:05:55.040]   Ephesians 2-10.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:57.480]   So this is where we're gonna be looking at our passage for today.
[00:05:57.480 --> 00:06:01.200]   You guys, most of you guys probably looked at this or you're moaning emotional.
[00:06:01.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   I'm gonna start with verse 10, and
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:08.640]   then we're gonna work our way from verse 1 after I read to you
[00:06:08.640 --> 00:06:12.160]   the purpose of our existence and our Christian life.
[00:06:12.160 --> 00:06:17.760]   Ephesians 2-10 reads, for we are his workmanship,
[00:06:17.760 --> 00:06:21.120]   created in Christ Jesus for good works,
[00:06:21.120 --> 00:06:25.400]   which God prepared beforehand so that we would walk in them.
[00:06:25.400 --> 00:06:30.800]   So before all of these things were created, very good, and
[00:06:30.800 --> 00:06:35.760]   before sin entered the world to corrupt everything, God had ordained an eternal
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:39.640]   purpose for your life, and he's ordained an eternal purpose for mine.
[00:06:39.640 --> 00:06:45.560]   And it was for the purpose of good works that we would walk continually
[00:06:45.560 --> 00:06:48.920]   in these good works and give him glory.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:51.880]   So what is the purpose of our Christian faith?
[00:06:51.880 --> 00:06:54.400]   What is the purpose of my existence?
[00:06:54.400 --> 00:06:56.360]   What is the purpose of my life?
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:06:57.600]   Well, here it is.
[00:06:57.600 --> 00:07:00.720]   And I'm gonna repeat this about 15 times in this sermon, so
[00:07:00.720 --> 00:07:02.560]   you're gonna remember this and memorize it and
[00:07:02.560 --> 00:07:05.120]   leave here annoyed by my voice in your head.
[00:07:05.120 --> 00:07:05.680]   Here we go.
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:08.000]   This is the purpose for which you're created.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:12.480]   You were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:07:12.480 --> 00:07:15.960]   And I'll say it again, some of you guys are scrambling.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:23.960]   You were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:34.000]   You were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:07:34.000 --> 00:07:37.960]   And this is the meta-narrative that begins in Genesis and
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:41.760]   ends with ultimate glory to this creator God in the book of Revelation.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:44.480]   So this is our purpose.
[00:07:44.480 --> 00:07:46.520]   And what a glorious purpose it is.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:51.640]   The purpose of our lives is to know this God and make him known in our lives.
[00:07:51.640 --> 00:07:55.920]   And it's a privilege that we will spend eternity growing in knowledge of
[00:07:55.920 --> 00:08:01.920]   this God and giving glory to this great God who is due worship.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:05.040]   So this is eternal life, that they may know you,
[00:08:05.040 --> 00:08:08.920]   the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you are saved.
[00:08:08.920 --> 00:08:14.560]   And eternal life, for those of you who have been saved, has already started.
[00:08:14.560 --> 00:08:20.840]   So this knowledge of God has already begun.
[00:08:20.840 --> 00:08:26.000]   So you were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:27.640]   Amen?
[00:08:27.640 --> 00:08:29.800]   And here's the bonus answer.
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:31.960]   What is the purpose of marriage?
[00:08:31.960 --> 00:08:40.240]   I say it simply as a strategic alliance where two believers join forces and
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:45.760]   become far more useful to this purpose where they come together to do
[00:08:45.760 --> 00:08:49.600]   far greater things than what they could have done as individuals.
[00:08:49.600 --> 00:08:50.160]   All right?
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:55.000]   So the purpose of marriage is to give God even more glory that you can
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:58.120]   possibly give as a family unit together.
[00:08:58.120 --> 00:09:03.440]   You were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   But there's a problem here.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:09.440]   This is something we can all say amen to, but
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.560]   we actually have a hard time submitting to this purpose.
[00:09:12.560 --> 00:09:18.800]   There is a part of us, even if we have submitted to the Lordship of Christ in
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.760]   our lives, that remains offended by this purpose.
[00:09:22.760 --> 00:09:28.040]   And if you've been a Christian for a length of time,
[00:09:28.040 --> 00:09:31.880]   you've observed seasons of wandering and strain from this purpose.
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:37.280]   And part of this is because our flesh has been so fully corrupted by sin.
[00:09:37.280 --> 00:09:43.960]   And though sin is dead in us, it is still dying in us.
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:49.080]   So I want us to read Ephesians chapter 2 verses 1 through 3.
[00:09:49.080 --> 00:09:50.360]   I'll be reading out of the NASB.
[00:09:50.360 --> 00:09:59.560]   And you were dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly walked
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:04.280]   according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of
[00:10:04.280 --> 00:10:09.280]   the air, of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[00:10:10.400 --> 00:10:15.600]   Among them, we too all formerly live in the lusts of our flesh,
[00:10:15.600 --> 00:10:18.440]   indulging the desires of the flesh and of the mind.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:23.520]   And we're by nature children of wrath, even as the rest.
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:31.760]   So verse 1 says, you were, past tense, you were dead in your trespasses and sins.
[00:10:31.760 --> 00:10:34.640]   So I have a question that's very important for us to address.
[00:10:34.640 --> 00:10:35.280]   What is sin?
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:38.200]   It is a very important question.
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:42.520]   And this is something you have to be very careful not to misdefine.
[00:10:42.520 --> 00:10:50.160]   An inaccurate definition of sin leads to a misdiagnosis and a misapplication.
[00:10:50.160 --> 00:10:51.720]   And so what is sin?
[00:10:51.720 --> 00:10:55.000]   Be careful not to misdiagnose.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.040]   A misdiagnosis is a dangerous thing.
[00:10:59.040 --> 00:11:01.280]   A misdiagnosis of a disease can be fatal.
[00:11:01.280 --> 00:11:03.640]   So what is sin?
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:09.880]   When we say sin, we naturally think of things like murder, theft, alcoholism,
[00:11:09.880 --> 00:11:13.360]   pornography, embezzlement, lying, cheating, and things like that.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:18.000]   And yes, they can be categorized as sins, but
[00:11:18.000 --> 00:11:22.120]   those things are symptomatic of deeper problems.
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:28.280]   Sin, in the original language, is hamartia, H-A-M-A-R-T-I-A, hamartia.
[00:11:28.280 --> 00:11:31.800]   And basically, it just means to miss the mark.
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:32.760]   So what is our purpose?
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:41.720]   We are created by God, for God, to love God, and to serve God.
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:44.280]   And sin is not doing that.
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:49.840]   Hamartia means failing to hit its purpose.
[00:11:49.840 --> 00:11:54.600]   It means living in opposition and outright rebellion toward this purpose.
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:58.880]   Failed, we are to live up to the holy standard that has been set by our holy,
[00:11:58.880 --> 00:12:02.240]   holy, worthy, worthy creator.
[00:12:02.240 --> 00:12:06.960]   And sin has so tainted us that we are offended by this purpose when we
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:07.920]   actually think upon it.
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:14.000]   Because in our flesh, we want a God that is a better version of us.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:17.120]   We want a God who will love us and who will serve us.
[00:12:17.120 --> 00:12:19.320]   We want a God who will do our bidding.
[00:12:19.320 --> 00:12:24.320]   And in our flesh, we absolutely hate our purpose.
[00:12:24.320 --> 00:12:26.480]   And we struggle passionately against it.
[00:12:26.480 --> 00:12:29.560]   No, we are not created by you and for you to serve you and to love you.
[00:12:29.560 --> 00:12:34.920]   We are created...you are here for us, is our flesh's natural response.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.920]   Murder, drug abuse, theft, lying, stealing, cheating, idolatry,
[00:12:41.920 --> 00:12:44.360]   all of these things, yes, they are sins.
[00:12:44.360 --> 00:12:50.600]   But essentially and basically, these outward deeds are a byproduct of an even
[00:12:50.600 --> 00:12:53.720]   more corrupted condition.
[00:12:53.720 --> 00:12:58.880]   So we enter the world hostile toward the ways of God.
[00:12:58.880 --> 00:13:01.160]   And this, you guys acknowledge, right?
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:08.040]   We have entered into this world missing the mark from the very get-go.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:12.000]   So do not miscategorize and misdefine sin.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:18.800]   In November 2017, three UCLA basketball players were in Shanghai,
[00:13:18.800 --> 00:13:22.720]   and they were arrested for shoplifting at a Louis Vuitton store.
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:27.240]   One of the three was none other than LeAngelo Ball, brother to the then
[00:13:27.240 --> 00:13:29.600]   later Lonzo Ball.
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:30.280]   You guys remember this?
[00:13:30.280 --> 00:13:31.080]   Not sure if you remember this.
[00:13:31.080 --> 00:13:31.600]   Yeah, okay.
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.200]   So he got caught.
[00:13:33.200 --> 00:13:37.400]   And here's what he said in an interview while he was still in China.
[00:13:37.400 --> 00:13:42.840]   "We all went out one night, went to the malls, went to the Louis Vuitton store,
[00:13:42.840 --> 00:13:45.440]   and people started taking stuff.
[00:13:45.440 --> 00:13:50.040]   And then, you know me, just not thinking and being with them,
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:51.800]   I took something too.
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:54.160]   And we left thinking, 'We'll just get away.'
[00:13:54.160 --> 00:13:55.840]   You know how kids think.
[00:13:55.840 --> 00:13:58.800]   I didn't realize until I got back to my hotel.
[00:13:58.800 --> 00:14:00.960]   I'm like, 'That was stupid.'
[00:14:00.960 --> 00:14:03.000]   But then I read, 'It was too late.'
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:07.360]   And then sure enough, the next morning, the police came and got us.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:13.840]   I feel embarrassed, but I assure you, this is not who I am."
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:16.400]   So basically, he said that his teammates influenced him to do this,
[00:14:16.400 --> 00:14:17.840]   so he blame-shifted.
[00:14:17.840 --> 00:14:21.440]   And then he said that this kind of behavior is not really indicative
[00:14:21.440 --> 00:14:24.240]   of who he really is.
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:28.000]   You know what I thought when I read the interview from this press release?
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:31.080]   Initially, because it happens all the time, people blame-shift.
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:38.520]   I thought, "No, D'Angelo, that is who you really and truly are.
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:42.120]   You are walking according to the course of this world, according to the prince
[00:14:42.120 --> 00:14:43.520]   of the power of the air.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:46.160]   You are a son of disobedience."
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:47.280]   And not just being baller brand.
[00:14:47.280 --> 00:14:49.280]   "You are a son of disobedience.
[00:14:49.280 --> 00:14:53.280]   You are living in the lust of your flesh, indulging the desires of your flesh,
[00:14:53.280 --> 00:14:55.760]   and of the mind.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:59.120]   That's who you are."
[00:14:59.120 --> 00:15:02.680]   As was I.
[00:15:02.680 --> 00:15:05.960]   This is my 19th year of pastoral ministry, so my original youth,
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:11.040]   who are actually in this room now, as old people, okay?
[00:15:11.040 --> 00:15:17.160]   This is my 27th year as a Christian, and I'm becoming more and more convinced
[00:15:17.160 --> 00:15:22.120]   that there is absolutely nothing good in me outside of Christ.
[00:15:22.120 --> 00:15:24.280]   You ain't meant to that.
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:28.200]   There's nothing good in you.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   There's nothing good in me outside of Christ.
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:40.160]   In my flesh, I'm going to include you, in your flesh, there is zero good.
[00:15:40.160 --> 00:15:43.840]   Only in and through Christ have I become a saint.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:46.400]   Only in and through Christ have I become a saint.
[00:15:46.400 --> 00:15:51.520]   Sin at its roots is living in rebellion to the God or purpose for which you and I
[00:15:51.520 --> 00:15:53.520]   have been created.
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:58.200]   Everything that disgusts and discourages us in this fallen world,
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.520]   all the stuff that you see on the news, all the just...
[00:16:01.520 --> 00:16:03.840]   I don't even want to read the news anymore, right?
[00:16:03.840 --> 00:16:10.040]   All of that stuff is an outward expression of the internal condition
[00:16:10.040 --> 00:16:13.120]   of fallen man.
[00:16:13.120 --> 00:16:15.200]   Sin.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.160]   You were created by God and for God to love God and to serve God,
[00:16:19.160 --> 00:16:27.360]   and sin is living in hostility toward this divine purpose.
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:30.080]   And what are the consequences?
[00:16:30.080 --> 00:16:30.960]   There are three.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:36.440]   First one is corruption of the spirit that is now continually working in the
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.280]   sense of disobedience, corruption.
[00:16:38.280 --> 00:16:41.320]   So, no one, and Pastor Peter's mentioned this before on a Sunday,
[00:16:41.320 --> 00:16:45.120]   left to his own becomes less sinful.
[00:16:45.120 --> 00:16:50.280]   Without the intervention of God, man becomes more and more rotten.
[00:16:50.280 --> 00:16:52.200]   And the rotting gets worse and worse.
[00:16:52.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   And as the rotting gets worse and worse, the pain becomes more and more
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:17:01.440]   unbearable, and sin perverts and corrupts everything.
[00:17:01.440 --> 00:17:08.240]   And the things that are good in life, sin corrupts it even more to make it worse.
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:09.200]   Corruption is the first one.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:13.400]   Second consequence of sin is separation.
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:17.800]   Sin always separates.
[00:17:17.800 --> 00:17:20.840]   It causes a separation between man and God.
[00:17:20.840 --> 00:17:24.840]   You guys know this feeling when you're in a sin, you don't want to go pray to the
[00:17:24.840 --> 00:17:25.400]   Lord.
[00:17:25.400 --> 00:17:27.800]   Sin separates God and man.
[00:17:27.800 --> 00:17:30.400]   Sin separates man and creation.
[00:17:30.400 --> 00:17:33.000]   Sin separates man and man.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.920]   Sin separates even man and self.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:39.560]   Hatred, fear, separation.
[00:17:39.560 --> 00:17:45.680]   Given enough time, sin will cause a rift in every single relationship that you will
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:47.520]   ever have.
[00:17:47.520 --> 00:17:48.880]   Corruption, separation.
[00:17:48.880 --> 00:17:51.600]   The third one is death.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:55.440]   And it says, "And you were dead," past tense.
[00:17:55.440 --> 00:17:59.360]   Romans 6.23, where the wages of sin is?
[00:17:59.360 --> 00:18:00.680]   Death.
[00:18:00.680 --> 00:18:05.000]   So, when Adam and Eve sinned against God, death entered the world and tainted and
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:06.880]   killed everything.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:09.080]   Perhaps not immediately.
[00:18:09.080 --> 00:18:11.920]   God told them, "You shall surely die."
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:16.240]   And as a result, death has come to all of us.
[00:18:16.240 --> 00:18:17.920]   Physical death is now a certainty.
[00:18:17.920 --> 00:18:23.600]   Spiritual death, however, is a much scarier prospect that should make all of us shiver
[00:18:23.600 --> 00:18:27.160]   to some degree.
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.560]   Verse 2, it says, "We were once sons of disobedience."
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.840]   Verse 3, "We were by nature children of wrath."
[00:18:36.840 --> 00:18:40.120]   Technon, child of wrath.
[00:18:40.120 --> 00:18:41.120]   This is one of the reasons I don't like the NIV.
[00:18:41.120 --> 00:18:44.520]   The NIV has done a major disservice to this verse.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:46.000]   We were deserving of wrath.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   No, no, no.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:49.680]   The original language is very strong.
[00:18:49.680 --> 00:18:52.860]   You were a child of wrath.
[00:18:52.860 --> 00:19:01.080]   You were basically the spawn of scum and filth to be immediately and wrathfully wiped out.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:09.040]   You, by your spiritual DNA, are an object of derision, should be wiped out immediately.
[00:19:09.040 --> 00:19:10.040]   That's what it's saying.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:11.040]   Not just deserving of wrath.
[00:19:11.040 --> 00:19:21.440]   So, from the day of our conception, Psalm 51, 5, from the very day of our conception,
[00:19:21.440 --> 00:19:26.840]   we should have and would have been prepared for the full grunt of the wrath of God because
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:30.760]   we were conceived in sin.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:33.200]   Let me illustrate this for you.
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:39.040]   I do teach to the children, so I can make this a little bit fun.
[00:19:39.040 --> 00:19:40.040]   Mosquitoes.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:42.360]   I hate them.
[00:19:42.360 --> 00:19:47.840]   I use the word hate seldomly, but for mosquitoes, I will use the H word hate.
[00:19:47.840 --> 00:19:48.840]   I hate mosquitoes.
[00:19:48.840 --> 00:19:56.200]   I have yet to meet a single person in my life that loves mosquitoes.
[00:19:56.200 --> 00:20:01.360]   And one of the reasons I hate them even more is because they love me.
[00:20:01.360 --> 00:20:04.360]   They don't love my wife as much.
[00:20:04.360 --> 00:20:08.640]   So, it's a frustrating thing in the middle of the night.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:13.520]   I love just killing them.
[00:20:13.520 --> 00:20:17.240]   In the middle, in Korea, we used to have these tennis racket things that would kill bugs.
[00:20:17.240 --> 00:20:20.240]   We had so many in our apartment on the 18th floor.
[00:20:20.240 --> 00:20:21.880]   You hear that?
[00:20:21.880 --> 00:20:22.880]   Just pop.
[00:20:22.880 --> 00:20:29.440]   It would just make my slumber so sweet.
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.440]   I hate them.
[00:20:30.440 --> 00:20:38.720]   And as I've killed my many fair share of mosquitoes over the years, I've realized one tragic fact
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:39.720]   is that they die too quickly.
[00:20:39.720 --> 00:20:45.080]   They're easy to catch, hard to keep alive.
[00:20:45.080 --> 00:20:48.320]   Because in the middle of the night, when I'm not thinking straight, I've got bumps on my
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:49.320]   arm and my legs.
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:52.840]   I actually want to just catch it and torment it.
[00:20:52.840 --> 00:20:55.840]   I want to just rip off a wing at the time.
[00:20:55.840 --> 00:20:56.840]   I advise you to do that, right?
[00:20:56.840 --> 00:20:57.840]   I want to rip off its wings.
[00:20:57.840 --> 00:20:58.840]   I want to cut the nose off of its scissors.
[00:20:58.840 --> 00:20:59.840]   I want to put it in the microwave and let it explode.
[00:20:59.840 --> 00:21:00.840]   I want to torture it because it caused me so much torment.
[00:21:00.840 --> 00:21:13.840]   But when I grab the mosquito, it's usually dead and bloody, full of not my wives, but
[00:21:13.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   my blood.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:22.840]   Now, I am not the only one who hates mosquitoes.
[00:21:22.840 --> 00:21:30.440]   If a mosquito were flying around my head right now and I killed it, I doubt that any of you
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:31.440]   would call the authorities on me.
[00:21:31.440 --> 00:21:39.640]   If a mosquito was on the wall and you guys killed it, someone next to you killed it,
[00:21:39.640 --> 00:21:40.640]   no problemo.
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:51.920]   Even if a mosquito did not bite any one of us, its very presence would trigger in us
[00:21:51.920 --> 00:21:56.920]   a desire to kill it.
[00:21:56.920 --> 00:21:59.360]   Why?
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:05.720]   Because mosquitoes represent disease, corruption, and in some places in the world, death.
[00:22:05.720 --> 00:22:11.160]   If we were in areas where malaria, Zika, dengue were prevalent, we actually would encourage
[00:22:11.160 --> 00:22:16.240]   all of us to kill every mosquito on sight.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:18.880]   I hate mosquitoes.
[00:22:18.880 --> 00:22:21.440]   Some people hate roaches more than mosquitoes.
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:22.960]   It's because you guys don't get bit.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:26.440]   But I hate them with a passion.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.440]   And why do I share this silly illustration?
[00:22:32.440 --> 00:22:39.080]   To remind you that the distance between you and God is infinitely greater than the distance
[00:22:39.080 --> 00:22:42.560]   between you and a mosquito.
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:51.080]   There is even less to love in you and me than there is to love in a mosquito or a cockroach.
[00:22:51.080 --> 00:22:58.400]   We were by nature, tapped on, spawned of wrath.
[00:22:58.400 --> 00:23:01.880]   See remember I said that we have to be careful not to mystify sin.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:02.880]   The problem of sin is not primarily an external one, it is thoroughly internal.
[00:23:02.880 --> 00:23:03.880]   It has corrupted everything in our lives.
[00:23:03.880 --> 00:23:04.880]   And one of the things that religious people make, the primary misdiagnosis, is in focusing
[00:23:04.880 --> 00:23:05.880]   on the external, seeking to address the symptoms and not the disease.
[00:23:05.880 --> 00:23:06.880]   Just as cold medicine does not cure the cold, but rather just temporarily hides the symptoms,
[00:23:06.880 --> 00:23:07.880]   good effort toward godliness and piety does not cure the cold.
[00:23:07.880 --> 00:23:08.880]   It is a good effort toward the good.
[00:23:08.880 --> 00:23:09.880]   And I'm not saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:09.880 --> 00:23:10.880]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:11.880]   I'm not saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:11.880 --> 00:23:12.880]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:12.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:14.880]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:14.880 --> 00:23:15.880]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:15.880 --> 00:23:16.880]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:16.880 --> 00:23:40.120]   I'm saying that you should be doing that.
[00:23:40.120 --> 00:24:01.560]   You should be doing that.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:27.680]   You should be doing that.
[00:24:27.680 --> 00:24:35.800]   You should be doing that.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:57.240]   You should be doing that.
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:25:23.560]   You should be doing that.
[00:25:23.560 --> 00:25:51.760]   You should be doing that.
[00:25:51.760 --> 00:26:00.880]   You should be doing that.
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:12.160]   You should be doing that.
[00:26:12.160 --> 00:26:38.480]   You should be doing that.
[00:26:38.480 --> 00:27:04.800]   You should be doing that.
[00:27:04.800 --> 00:27:33.120]   You should be doing that.
[00:27:33.120 --> 00:27:42.340]   And on my deathbed, I leave all that I have to Him."
[00:27:42.340 --> 00:27:44.820]   You laugh!
[00:27:44.820 --> 00:27:53.020]   But it's even sillier that God would make us alive together with Christ.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:54.540]   Verse five.
[00:27:54.540 --> 00:27:59.100]   See, we serve a strange God, and why do I affectionately call Him strange?
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:03.620]   I don't call Him strange because He chose to withhold wrath.
[00:28:03.620 --> 00:28:06.980]   I don't call Him strange because He extends mercy.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:11.020]   There have been wicked leaders in the history of the world that have been occasionally merciful.
[00:28:11.020 --> 00:28:15.660]   There have been wicked leaders in the world that have just kind of withheld wrath.
[00:28:15.660 --> 00:28:22.100]   There have been man-made gods who have been known to be occasionally kind.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:30.620]   I call our God strange because He didn't just not send us to hell, He raised us up with
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:36.540]   Christ, seated us with Christ in the heavenly places.
[00:28:36.540 --> 00:28:42.780]   And our destiny as children of God is to spend eternity being showered with kindness upon
[00:28:42.780 --> 00:28:49.500]   kindness upon kindness by this God of love.
[00:28:49.500 --> 00:29:00.020]   He will even let once sin-tainted, fallen, hostile man to see Him face to face.
[00:29:00.020 --> 00:29:06.580]   First John 3.2, "Beloved, we are now children of God, and He has not appeared as yet what
[00:29:06.580 --> 00:29:11.300]   we will be, but we know that when He appears, we will be like Him because we will see Him
[00:29:11.300 --> 00:29:14.140]   just as He is."
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:17.700]   This is grace.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:23.060]   Absolutely wonderful, absolutely silly, dumbfounding grace.
[00:29:23.060 --> 00:29:31.500]   I almost want to change that song from "Amazing Grace" to "Dumbfounding Grace" or "Absurdly
[00:29:31.500 --> 00:29:39.780]   Strange Grace" because "amazing" sometimes doesn't quite cut it.
[00:29:39.780 --> 00:29:46.140]   So there is now a cure for sin, and you and I have believed and placed our faith in Christ.
[00:29:46.140 --> 00:29:54.700]   We have been saved, and now we have been restored to the purpose for which we have been created
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:30:04.060]   for His glory, and as a result, we will experience immense satisfaction and joy.
[00:30:04.060 --> 00:30:05.740]   So how did we become saved?
[00:30:05.740 --> 00:30:06.740]   It's even sillier.
[00:30:06.740 --> 00:30:07.740]   Do you guys know John 3.16?
[00:30:07.740 --> 00:30:18.620]   "For God so loved the world that He gave His only Son, and whoever believes in Him shall
[00:30:18.620 --> 00:30:23.460]   not perish but have eternal life."
[00:30:23.460 --> 00:30:28.420]   I've heard many a sermon that says, "For God so loved the world."
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:33.940]   That's actually inaccurate because the Greek word there is "koutos" which is "thus," like
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:39.380]   this, in this way, in this manner, is the word "so."
[00:30:39.380 --> 00:30:40.380]   Like so.
[00:30:40.380 --> 00:30:46.740]   And you have to look at John 3.14 and 15, "For just as Moses lifted up the serpent in
[00:30:46.740 --> 00:30:50.380]   the wilderness, so the Son of Man must be lifted up.
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:58.100]   For God in this silly, absurd way loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son,
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:05.220]   and whoever looks up in faith will not perish but have eternal life."
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.460]   Numbers 21.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:09.980]   We see the people in the wilderness doing what they do best, and we've been in Hebrews,
[00:31:09.980 --> 00:31:10.980]   right?
[00:31:10.980 --> 00:31:11.980]   What do they do best?
[00:31:11.980 --> 00:31:12.980]   Drift, rebel, lay hands on.
[00:31:12.980 --> 00:31:22.300]   Numbers 21, God sends fiery serpents, and in verse 7 of Numbers 21, we see a kind of
[00:31:22.300 --> 00:31:26.740]   repentance, and they say, "We have sinned, Moses, because we have spoken against the
[00:31:26.740 --> 00:31:28.380]   Lord and you.
[00:31:28.380 --> 00:31:29.380]   We are scared of the consequences.
[00:31:29.380 --> 00:31:35.580]   Intercede with the Lord that He may remove the serpent from us."
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:40.980]   So God told Moses to fashion a bronze serpent and to raise it up on a staff, and all they
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:46.340]   have to do to be saved from these fiery serpents is just to look.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:50.460]   Basically the message is, "Look and live."
[00:31:50.460 --> 00:31:52.780]   For God in this way loved the world.
[00:31:52.780 --> 00:31:57.740]   He made Him who knew no sin to become sin for us that we might become the righteousness
[00:31:57.740 --> 00:31:58.940]   of God.
[00:31:58.940 --> 00:32:03.980]   So the appropriate response when you and I find ourselves drifting as individuals, when
[00:32:03.980 --> 00:32:12.380]   you and I find ourselves in sin, isn't primarily greater religious effort.
[00:32:12.380 --> 00:32:20.180]   Sometimes our efforts are based more on superstition than on truth.
[00:32:20.180 --> 00:32:24.460]   God cares if you agree.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:31.060]   Sometimes we are more afraid of the wrath and the judgment of God who already adopted
[00:32:31.060 --> 00:32:33.660]   us, who loves us as His children.
[00:32:33.660 --> 00:32:34.660]   We're more afraid of consequences.
[00:32:34.660 --> 00:32:37.660]   "Oh, my business is going to fail if I don't do this."
[00:32:37.660 --> 00:32:42.220]   We're more superstitious than we are faith-filled.
[00:32:42.220 --> 00:32:52.140]   And the appropriate response is not greater effort.
[00:32:52.140 --> 00:32:55.740]   You know what the people of God were doing to this bronze serpent from about 1500 to
[00:32:55.740 --> 00:32:59.300]   700 BC?
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:04.980]   For 800 years, they saw a mystical power in this thing.
[00:33:04.980 --> 00:33:07.860]   It became a stone of legend.
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:08.860]   So they were burning incest to this thing.
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:12.340]   They even gave it a name, "Negushtan."
[00:33:12.340 --> 00:33:15.420]   Basically, it just means bronze serpent.
[00:33:15.420 --> 00:33:16.420]   They weren't that creative.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:17.420]   They gave it a name.
[00:33:17.420 --> 00:33:21.940]   King Hezekiah, the righteous king, one of the first things that he did was just break
[00:33:21.940 --> 00:33:22.940]   it in pieces.
[00:33:22.940 --> 00:33:28.660]   This has no power to save you.
[00:33:28.660 --> 00:33:39.420]   You see, when we misdiagnose our problem of sin and of our flesh, we naturally try to
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.740]   be more moral.
[00:33:40.740 --> 00:33:44.080]   We naturally conform to the church's expectations.
[00:33:44.080 --> 00:33:49.020]   We naturally just try and get more vital knowledge in our heads.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:53.140]   But that, in and of itself, those are good things.
[00:33:53.140 --> 00:33:58.940]   But that doesn't cure this problem of drifting.
[00:33:58.940 --> 00:34:03.060]   So then the question is, how do we stay anchored in Christ?
[00:34:03.060 --> 00:34:05.940]   How do we stay anchored in Christ?
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:14.980]   That's actually a misleading question because if you're a child of God, guess what?
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:15.980]   Not by works.
[00:34:15.980 --> 00:34:21.980]   For by grace you have been saved through faith and that not of yourselves.
[00:34:21.980 --> 00:34:25.780]   It is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast.
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:31.900]   For we are God's workmanship, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which he prepared beforehand
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:32.900]   that we would walk in them.
[00:34:32.900 --> 00:34:33.900]   It is not based on us.
[00:34:33.900 --> 00:34:34.900]   So if you are a child of God, you are already anchored in Christ.
[00:34:34.900 --> 00:34:35.900]   Hebrews 6, it says, "These are things God cannot buy," it says in Hebrews 6.
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:36.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:36.900 --> 00:34:37.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:38.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:38.900 --> 00:34:39.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:40.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:40.900 --> 00:34:41.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:41.900 --> 00:34:42.900]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:34:42.900 --> 00:35:06.740]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:33.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:33.620 --> 00:35:40.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:40.620 --> 00:35:46.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:50.620 --> 00:35:51.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:51.620 --> 00:35:52.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:52.620 --> 00:35:53.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:53.620 --> 00:35:54.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:54.620 --> 00:35:55.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:56.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:57.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:57.620 --> 00:35:58.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:35:58.620 --> 00:36:05.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:05.620 --> 00:36:06.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:06.620 --> 00:36:07.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:07.620 --> 00:36:08.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:09.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:09.620 --> 00:36:10.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:10.620 --> 00:36:11.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:11.620 --> 00:36:12.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:12.620 --> 00:36:13.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:14.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:15.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:15.620 --> 00:36:16.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:16.620 --> 00:36:17.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:18.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:18.620 --> 00:36:39.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:36:39.620 --> 00:37:03.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:37:03.620 --> 00:37:22.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:47.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:37:47.620 --> 00:38:13.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:38:13.620 --> 00:38:42.620]   And so we have this hope as an anchor for the soul.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:48.500]   relationship that we have with Christ. So the application I'm going to leave you
[00:38:48.500 --> 00:38:58.100]   with is, simply tighten the slack on the anchor. Because at the end of
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:08.380]   the day, too much slack, what happens when a big wave comes? Damage! My
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:19.340]   encouragement and exhortation is simply this. Remember that you are a child of
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:28.220]   God, an heir to the kingdom of God, and that He loves you with an absurd, silly,
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:39.340]   reckless love. And His desire for you is just to understand fully and appreciate
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:50.940]   and be free in His love. That's it. There is no step one, step two, step three to
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:55.260]   having a good relationship with God, just like there is no step one, step two, step
[00:39:55.260 --> 00:40:03.340]   three to having a solid marriage. There's a constant adjustment that's needed. But
[00:40:03.340 --> 00:40:08.300]   our anchor that is sure and steadfast on the back of our shirts, what is the
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:17.580]   anchor? What Christ has done and what He is continuing to do now. Jesus Himself
[00:40:17.580 --> 00:40:26.020]   praised, John 17, 17 sanctified that in your truth, your word is truth. So
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:32.060]   whatever you can do to incline your ear to hear the voice of your Heavenly
[00:40:32.060 --> 00:40:41.340]   Father, do it. And naturally you will see yourself just tightening that slack. And
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:48.620]   who knows that will impact your family. Who knows you tightening that slack will
[00:40:48.620 --> 00:40:58.700]   encourage other members of this body of Christ. Religious effort will lead you to
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:05.500]   discouragement. Now that's not, I'm not saying don't try, but don't put your hope
[00:41:05.500 --> 00:41:15.340]   in yourself because there's nothing good in you outside of Christ. Amen?
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:26.500]   May the Lord remind us of His love afresh in this retreat. And may He astound us
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:31.860]   with more and more truths of how silly His love is that we would respond
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:43.340]   appropriately. Let's pray together. Lord we need you. Lord we so desperately need you.
[00:41:43.340 --> 00:42:01.660]   We are forgetful, rebellious people and we keep returning to our folly. So we
[00:42:01.660 --> 00:42:12.180]   pray knowing that the only hope for all of this is Christ. Lord draw near to us
[00:42:12.180 --> 00:42:27.060]   so that we may see you as you are and be changed by your nearness. We plead with you to draw near.
[00:42:27.060 --> 00:42:29.060]   In this we pray. In Jesus' name.
