[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.520]   For Alex, it's really easy actually. I think every single one of you in here, you've come
[00:00:05.520 --> 00:00:10.840]   and you want to show your support and you want to give a public affirmation, as Pastor
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:16.880]   Peter mentioned earlier, of your recognition of Alex's gifts and his service to the church
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:21.440]   and really kind of express to him the fact that you're praying for him as he and his
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:27.360]   family go out to China in a few months. I think for me, the thing that I'm really grateful
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.760]   for in terms of Alex is the fact that I've known him for such a long time and in that
[00:00:31.760 --> 00:00:37.720]   process he's always been a very consistent presence. My first experience with Alex was
[00:00:37.720 --> 00:00:41.440]   actually in a Bible study context. So I was teaching a Bible study over at Pastor Peter's
[00:00:41.440 --> 00:00:47.240]   house when his church was much smaller. And during those days, we didn't have a ton of
[00:00:47.240 --> 00:00:52.040]   newcomers so anytime someone new showed up to the church, immediately they stuck out.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.520]   And certainly with Alex, that was the case because he was, I mean, the moment he walked
[00:00:55.520 --> 00:01:01.280]   in, the biggest guy in the room. And so he walks in and the thing that I vividly remember
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.800]   about Alex was he was wearing his baseball cap backwards. And being the big guy that
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:13.160]   he is and before you really get to know him, he's a really friendly guy, but before you
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:17.800]   get to know him, he doesn't necessarily appear to be that way, I guess, at first glance.
[00:01:17.800 --> 00:01:23.080]   And so I saw this guy, he's got his hat backwards, he's this big guy, and I just thought to myself,
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:29.040]   like, this guy's bad news. It's bad news, got to make sure we guard the sheep and protect
[00:01:29.040 --> 00:01:34.320]   the flock. And if this guy's looking to cause trouble, then we got to make sure that we
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:40.760]   address that early. But clearly first impressions were changed dramatically as he continued
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:48.360]   to come out. We got to know him much better. And it's funny in that Alex going out to China
[00:01:48.360 --> 00:01:54.920]   is in a lot of ways, I think, going through the same sort of emotions and same sort of
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:02:00.880]   mental process that I was going through when we decided to move up to NorCal. And when
[00:02:00.880 --> 00:02:05.640]   he first again came out to Berean, he was just a college student. He was in one of the
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:11.280]   very first small groups I ever led at this church. And just from the get go, he exhibited
[00:02:11.280 --> 00:02:16.600]   his faithfulness, his desire to learn, to grow, and the fact that he really loved Christ
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:21.560]   and he loved the church. And then from that point of being a college student, he eventually,
[00:02:21.560 --> 00:02:25.400]   of course, graduated and he became more of a friend. I didn't really see him as someone
[00:02:25.400 --> 00:02:29.880]   that I shepherded, but I saw him as a brother in Christ. And our relationship grew to the
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:35.680]   point where I asked him to be one of my groomsmen, to stand up with me on my wedding day, because
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:41.400]   I felt like he was a brother that had encouraged me so tremendously that it would be fitting
[00:02:41.400 --> 00:02:46.960]   for him to be up there with me when I got married. And then so our relationship changed
[00:02:46.960 --> 00:02:52.520]   from me being his pastor to me being his brother and his friend. And then soon, of course,
[00:02:52.520 --> 00:02:57.480]   as again, Pastor Peter mentioned just a bit ago, he started to serve alongside me. So
[00:02:57.480 --> 00:03:05.360]   we were co-laborers too. And when we had sort of broached discussions about possible people
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:10.060]   that could help with the college ministry and Alex's name was mentioned, I mean, immediately
[00:03:10.060 --> 00:03:14.360]   there was no question that he would be a huge asset to our group. And I think the reason
[00:03:14.360 --> 00:03:20.200]   why is because again, being that consistent and faithful presence that he is, we knew
[00:03:20.200 --> 00:03:24.800]   what we were getting with Alex. We knew that by asking him, there was going to be certain
[00:03:24.800 --> 00:03:29.680]   things that we could expect for him to contribute into our ministry. And there was no question
[00:03:29.680 --> 00:03:35.100]   about asking him and him not being able to follow through with those things. And so during
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:41.040]   the time that we served together as co-laborers in gospel ministry in the local church, again,
[00:03:41.040 --> 00:03:46.840]   I found my relationship with him continued to transform. And now that he's being sent
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:53.880]   off by this church to do the work of the Great Commission out in China, I think it's just
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:59.400]   sort of the cherry on top in terms of this process of sanctification and growth and development
[00:03:59.400 --> 00:04:04.560]   that we've seen taking place in Alex's life. I think it should be gratifying for all of
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:11.600]   us to see and to take part in what's happening tonight, because this really is God operating
[00:04:11.600 --> 00:04:17.640]   through brothers and sisters in this community to not only be encouraged by Alex, but to
[00:04:17.640 --> 00:04:23.900]   really seek to encourage Alex and his family as they go out. But yeah, I'm just so thankful
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:31.200]   for Alex, for his presence in this church and as much of a loss as it'll be for Berean
[00:04:31.200 --> 00:04:37.840]   to have to send him out, China's going to gain a lot from Alex's presence. And so Alex
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:44.060]   is zealous for the gospel. Alex is zealous for the Great Commission and God has planted
[00:04:44.060 --> 00:04:49.800]   a seed of desire and conviction when it comes to gospel ministry out in China. And so the
[00:04:49.800 --> 00:04:54.040]   fact that Alex is being sent out with the support, the resources and the prayers of
[00:04:54.040 --> 00:04:58.040]   this church, I think we should anticipate and be really eager to hear about all that
[00:04:58.040 --> 00:05:04.560]   God is doing through him and through his family as they labor faithfully in Beijing. So brother,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:09.360]   I'm just again, so thankful for you, thankful for your friendship. I'm thankful that we
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:16.680]   can talk about anything from the angels to the Lakers to church ministry to just our
[00:05:16.680 --> 00:05:21.960]   spiritual lives and how things are going with us as parents and as husbands. And I really
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:27.180]   hope that we are able to encourage you tonight and even in the coming months before you leave,
[00:05:27.180 --> 00:05:36.600]   as much as you've encouraged us for the last several years. So thank you, brother.
[00:05:36.600 --> 00:05:53.240]   Ah, okay. I think every single one of us that was there at that Bible study when Pastor
[00:05:53.240 --> 00:06:00.320]   Alex first came into our house had the exact same impression. Yeah, because he didn't look
[00:06:00.320 --> 00:06:05.440]   like a guy who belonged in a church initially, you know, looked like a gangster guy. And
[00:06:05.440 --> 00:06:11.800]   he has that serious expression about him. And he, people call him Genghis Khan because
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:17.640]   he kind of looked like a Mongolian. And, but again, I think everybody knows who knows him
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:24.240]   well. He's like a big teddy bear inside. He tries to be this tough guy, but we know him.
[00:06:24.240 --> 00:06:31.080]   Yeah. So again, you know, when the scripture tells us, "Sanate lehens hastily," I remember
[00:06:31.080 --> 00:06:35.320]   talking to a brother, a pastor who's been ordained outside of the church. And he was
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:42.120]   telling me the process and how in the context of the ordination, he felt like, is this it?
[00:06:42.120 --> 00:06:46.040]   Is this the way ordination is supposed to be? Because the room full of 150 people, they
[00:06:46.040 --> 00:06:50.440]   passed the test and a bunch of people that didn't know them were saying, "Hey, you're
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:06:55.840]   being commissioned out into ministry." And I remember him just kind of leaving the ministry,
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:06:59.320]   leaving the ordination process. And he was saying how disappointed he was. He thought
[00:06:59.320 --> 00:07:03.520]   it would be more than that. And, and, and again, we were talking about that ordination
[00:07:03.520 --> 00:07:08.560]   process. Well, what did the Bible say? How does the Bible say we ought to bring people
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.040]   into ministry? That we ought to take very serious, you know, what it means to come into
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:17.920]   ministry that when we ordain somebody and say, as a church, we confirm the calling of
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:23.960]   this man, that we are not just hastily sending somebody out. Every once in a while, somebody
[00:07:23.960 --> 00:07:28.920]   would ask me, "Now, now that you're a pastor, do you encourage your children to go into
[00:07:28.920 --> 00:07:34.600]   ministry?" And, and I say this with a clear conscience. I said, "No, I do not. I do not
[00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:38.880]   encourage. In fact, I wouldn't encourage anybody, push anybody to go into ministry because I
[00:07:38.880 --> 00:07:45.120]   know what ministry means." Is that, there's that beginning process of like Simon of standing
[00:07:45.120 --> 00:07:49.080]   in front of people and leading and small groups and all of that stuff. There's a lot of behind
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:54.760]   the scene type of stuff that, again, you know, I was just having dinner with Pastor Aaron
[00:07:54.760 --> 00:07:58.240]   and you know, now that he's a senior pastor of his church up north, he knows exactly what
[00:07:58.240 --> 00:08:02.640]   I'm talking about. I mean, it's sometimes you feel like you're schizophrenic. You know,
[00:08:02.640 --> 00:08:06.400]   there's nights when you go home so encouraged, you know, I love this church and I'm doing
[00:08:06.400 --> 00:08:10.040]   the exact thing that I want to do. And then you wake up next morning, you get an email
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:13.240]   and it's like, "Oh my gosh, I don't want to do this anymore." You know, and you go through
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:17.720]   this roller coaster ride that's kind of hard to relate. It's like, why, why would, why
[00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:21.320]   would it, why would it be so difficult? And again, you know, Pastor Aaron knows exactly
[00:08:21.320 --> 00:08:25.960]   what I'm talking about. And soon Pastor Alex will know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:34.080]   And so the, the wear and tear that being called into ministry requires, and that's why he
[00:08:34.080 --> 00:08:42.840]   says someone who desires to be an elder is, seeks a noble task. Pastor Alex has never
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:50.680]   wavered in that. He, he wanted to do ministry. And again, being called into ministry, Paul
[00:08:50.680 --> 00:08:57.080]   says, Paul tells Timothy, 1 Timothy 1.18, wage the good warfare, right? Paul described
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:01.760]   ministry as warfare. He describes it as a fight in 1 Timothy 6.12. He says, "Fight
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:07.320]   the good fight." Again, Paul at the end of his life, 2 Timothy 4.7, he described the
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:12.040]   totality of his ministry as, "I have fought the good fight." So what we're doing today
[00:09:12.040 --> 00:09:17.040]   is really ordaining him to enter into this fight. Not that, the rest of the church is
[00:09:17.040 --> 00:09:21.560]   not, not that if you're not ordained, you're not in this fight. But in particular, when
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:26.360]   a man is ordained, when the church lays hands on this man, we're asking him to take charge,
[00:09:26.360 --> 00:09:30.720]   to take the lead. And when the criticisms come, when the bullets come, that you're going
[00:09:30.720 --> 00:09:35.600]   to be the guy in the front who's going to take the bullet first. So ordination really
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:43.740]   is a, a setting apart from the church to say, we're ordaining you. We're, we're confirming
[00:09:43.740 --> 00:09:51.340]   you to lead us in this fight. And so, yeah, I'm hesitant. I'm not eager to send my kids
[00:09:51.340 --> 00:09:56.240]   out to battle. Now, if they say they want to go, I will be the first one who will be
[00:09:56.240 --> 00:10:00.400]   proud. And I'd be, I'd be thankful that God is leading them in that direction. But would
[00:10:00.400 --> 00:10:04.840]   I ever push them in that direction? No, I would not push them in that direction. As
[00:10:04.840 --> 00:10:11.080]   we have this time of ordination, I want to encourage all of us, and in particularly,
[00:10:11.080 --> 00:10:15.920]   obviously, Pastor Alex. What does this day mean? And obviously he's been a pastor, at
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:22.040]   least serving as a pastor. But today, as we confirm him together, you know, when you launch
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.320]   a new business, you want to make sure that you have your proper, you know, study done,
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:31.440]   the market study. You know, you, is it the right place? Is there, is there a supply and
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.160]   demand? You know, whenever you, you do something new, you want to make sure that all the things
[00:10:37.160 --> 00:10:42.720]   are prepared and all the tools that you need, that, that you have that. You know, every
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:46.840]   year we have graduations. People graduate because they learned a set of facts and they're
[00:10:46.840 --> 00:10:52.280]   going to apply it in the real world. Well, ordination, calling it to ministry, is unlike
[00:10:52.280 --> 00:10:58.560]   anything else. It's unlike anything else because the battle that he's fighting is not a psychological
[00:10:58.560 --> 00:11:04.360]   battle. It's not a sociological battle. It's not a financial. It is spiritual. And that's
[00:11:04.360 --> 00:11:09.320]   why it says 2 Corinthians 10, 3-4, "For though we walk in the flesh, we are not waging war
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:13.280]   according to the flesh. For the weapons of our warfare are not of the flesh, but of the
[00:11:13.280 --> 00:11:20.400]   divine power to destroy strongholds." This is not something that we can enter into thinking
[00:11:20.400 --> 00:11:25.600]   that, well, you know, he's very articulate, he's strong, he has, he has a degree. He has
[00:11:25.600 --> 00:11:32.760]   many experiences. So now he's equipped to go. Paul warns us, again in Ephesians 6, 12
[00:11:32.760 --> 00:11:38.400]   and 13, "For we do not wrestle against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against authorities,
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.280]   against the cosmic powers over this present darkness, against the spiritual forces of
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:49.560]   evil in the heavenly places." It is a spiritual battle. He said our enemy is spiritual. And
[00:11:49.560 --> 00:11:55.120]   so therefore the weapons that we need to gear up on are spiritual. So again, I don't want
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:59.560]   to spend too much time in this, and I know you're already tired of, you know, your tolerance
[00:11:59.560 --> 00:12:04.080]   level of my preaching is already kind of filled to that point, so I don't want to go too much
[00:12:04.080 --> 00:12:09.200]   over. But at the same time, we want to encourage Pastor Alex, and again, reminder of the church,
[00:12:09.200 --> 00:12:15.760]   what this battle really is. Because it is a spiritual battle. The scripture tells us
[00:12:15.760 --> 00:12:21.320]   you have to gear up spiritually. And, you know, we don't look at Pastor Alex and say,
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:24.480]   you know, he's going to, we believe he's going to be successful and fruitful in ministry
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:30.440]   because, because we see all of his gifts, and he has all this education, all this experience,
[00:12:30.440 --> 00:12:35.600]   so now he's going to apply it to ministry. That's exactly opposite of what Paul says.
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   If that's our mentality, you're already setting yourself up for failure. He says, if God really
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:45.880]   exists, which we believe, if heaven and hell really exist, if angels are real, if demons
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:51.760]   are real, we know that our struggle is against them. It may manifest physically, but the
[00:12:51.760 --> 00:12:58.000]   real power behind our discouragement, the real power behind the pushback and the persecution
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:04.160]   is always spiritual. So therefore, we are reminded to gear up spiritually, he says,
[00:13:04.160 --> 00:13:10.880]   to put on the full armor of God. He says in Ephesians chapter 6, he says, "For we do not
[00:13:10.880 --> 00:13:14.440]   wrestle against flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against authorities, against the
[00:13:14.440 --> 00:13:19.600]   cosmic powers, over the present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:26.400]   heavenly places. Therefore, take up the whole armor of God, that you may be able to withstand
[00:13:26.400 --> 00:13:31.760]   in the evil day, and having done all to stand firm. Stand therefore, having fastened on
[00:13:31.760 --> 00:13:36.240]   the belt of truth." So the first thing that he says, you're putting on the armor of God.
[00:13:36.240 --> 00:13:41.360]   As we commission him to battle, the first thing he says is to fasten on the belt of
[00:13:41.360 --> 00:13:45.000]   truth. Now obviously the truth is referring to the Word of God, which we talked about
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.680]   this morning. But the idea of fastening on the belt of truth, it has the imagery of being
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:56.920]   prepared for action. Truth is not just changing our paradigm or the way that we look at the
[00:13:56.920 --> 00:14:03.360]   world. Truth equips us for battle. That's the image that we get. They would tie up their
[00:14:03.360 --> 00:14:07.920]   belts before they go into battle in order that whatever it is that they're wearing would
[00:14:07.920 --> 00:14:15.880]   not trip them up. So the first idea is to be prepared. He's been trained in seminary.
[00:14:15.880 --> 00:14:21.520]   He's in the process of getting his THM. And so he has a lot of biblical knowledge that's
[00:14:21.520 --> 00:14:26.800]   crammed into his head. And all of that is not simply to say, "Well, he's got a degree.
[00:14:26.800 --> 00:14:32.000]   Now he's got an MDiv. He's going to get a THM." And so because he has these titles,
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.040]   he said, "No, these truths are given to him to prepare him for action." And that's the
[00:14:37.040 --> 00:14:42.360]   first thing that he says, that the Word of God is our weapon. In fact, he begins the
[00:14:42.360 --> 00:14:49.440]   armor with the Word of God. And then at the end of it, he also says to put up the spirit
[00:14:49.440 --> 00:14:56.200]   of the sword, which is the Word of God. Second thing that he says is to put on the breastplate
[00:14:56.200 --> 00:15:05.360]   of righteousness. You will be tested. If you push against the darkness, they will push
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:12.040]   back. You don't go and preach the gospel in the darkness and darkness doesn't say, "Thank
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.680]   you." If you push against the darkness and you bring the gospel to people who have not
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:21.600]   heard, they are going to push you back. And one of the first ways that you'll see it manifested
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:26.240]   is in order to nullify your message, they will nullify the messenger. And that is the
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.240]   common thing that you see, even with the Apostle Paul. We see in Thessalonica where he preaches
[00:15:31.240 --> 00:15:35.760]   the gospel and he was so fruitful. When he left, in order to nullify the power of the
[00:15:35.760 --> 00:15:39.880]   gospel, they were saying that, "That guy is like any other philosopher who came here.
[00:15:39.880 --> 00:15:45.400]   All he wants from you is money." And they were trying to nullify his message by nullifying
[00:15:45.400 --> 00:15:51.060]   the messenger. And that's why he says to put on the full, the breastplate of righteousness.
[00:15:51.060 --> 00:15:58.200]   And that's why one of the first qualities of an elder is that he must be above reproach.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:04.760]   If your life is not above reproach, your message will be disqualified. People will listen to
[00:16:04.760 --> 00:16:11.520]   what you say and say, "That sounds great, but you, how can we trust anything you say?"
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:15.920]   They're going to, there's no other profession where you're going to be examined in every
[00:16:15.920 --> 00:16:22.640]   part of your life, by every facets of different people, young people, old people, people who
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:27.800]   are from one group or another, will examine your life to see, "Is this guy, is this guy
[00:16:27.800 --> 00:16:33.560]   able to preach this?" That's why Paul says in Acts 24, 16, "So I always take pains to
[00:16:33.560 --> 00:16:38.560]   have a clear conscience toward both God and man." And the reason why he takes pains to
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.120]   have a clear conscience before God and man is because he knows. He knows that his life
[00:16:44.120 --> 00:16:48.680]   is a platform to be able to preach the gospel because they would easily nullify, "You know
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.440]   what, Apostle Paul, that guy's saying all this stuff, but look at his life. Look at
[00:16:52.440 --> 00:16:55.880]   the way he spends his money. That guy, all he wants is money." So Paul lives in such
[00:16:55.880 --> 00:17:02.560]   a way so that he would not be accused of any wrongdoing. 1 Peter 2, 12, "Live such good
[00:17:02.560 --> 00:17:06.660]   lives among the pagans that though they accuse you of doing wrong, they may see your good
[00:17:06.660 --> 00:17:13.400]   deeds and glorify God on the day he visits us." Even when they want to disqualify you,
[00:17:13.400 --> 00:17:18.840]   he says, "Live in such a way to put on the breastplate of righteousness that Christ gives,
[00:17:18.840 --> 00:17:23.680]   that even if they want to accuse you, they can't." Thirdly, "Put on the shoes for your
[00:17:23.680 --> 00:17:27.720]   feet having put on the readiness given by the gospel of peace." So again, putting on
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.760]   the shoes, he gives us a picture of being ready to go. And I would say, if, when anybody
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.080]   says that they're interested in going into ministry, the first thing that I will ask
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:42.780]   them is, "Are you ready to go?" If you, once you're done with your training and the church
[00:17:42.780 --> 00:17:47.680]   ordains you, are you ready to go? So what do you mean by ready to go? If you are being
[00:17:47.680 --> 00:17:54.040]   ordained so that you can be here and you see, you see the comforts of, of maybe, on appearance
[00:17:54.040 --> 00:17:58.120]   looks like, "Well, this is comfortable, this is nice, and this is what I want." The first
[00:17:58.120 --> 00:18:02.080]   thing I would ask is, "Are you ready to go?" Are you standing before God and saying, "Here
[00:18:02.080 --> 00:18:09.480]   am I, send me." Obviously, Pastor Alex has made that commitment from the get-go. That
[00:18:09.480 --> 00:18:16.440]   he is being ordained today because he's already committed to go. The word gospel just means
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:21.240]   good news. And by the nature of the word news, news is not something, you don't tell somebody,
[00:18:21.240 --> 00:18:26.960]   "I have some news," and then walk away. Right? You don't tell somebody, "I got some news."
[00:18:26.960 --> 00:18:34.120]   You don't say, "I have good news. See you tomorrow." Right? The nature of the word gospel
[00:18:34.120 --> 00:18:39.520]   means to tell somebody. That's what the word means, news. So to be a minister of the gospel
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:45.720]   means that he is ready to go. He's ready to tell people. He's ready to proclaim it, wherever
[00:18:45.720 --> 00:18:50.120]   it is God sends him. So the first call of a minister is to stand before God and say,
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:58.400]   "Here am I, send me." If we're not ready to be sent, then we're not ready to be, to be
[00:18:58.400 --> 00:19:05.960]   a proclaimer of the gospel. It's to go. But going isn't just about moving location. We
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.760]   say, "Well, if we go to China, we'll go." But again, one of the best insights that I've
[00:19:11.760 --> 00:19:16.720]   gained about mission work was from a missionary who was out in the mission field. And he says,
[00:19:16.720 --> 00:19:21.680]   "The greatest challenge of a missionary is to continue to go." Because you have that initial
[00:19:21.680 --> 00:19:26.840]   going. You pack up your stuff, and it's uncomfortable, and you move to a new location. But our natural
[00:19:26.840 --> 00:19:32.360]   human nature is to learn to adjust. Everywhere we go, make it our home. Whether it's here,
[00:19:32.360 --> 00:19:37.520]   whether it's NorCal, or whether it's a foreign country, it's our natural nature to want to
[00:19:37.520 --> 00:19:42.400]   make wherever we go our home. And that's the challenge, is to constantly remember that
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:48.200]   we are aliens and strangers in this world, whether you are living in Irvine. And again,
[00:19:48.200 --> 00:19:51.920]   that's some of the mistakes that we make, is that we think, "Well, we're home, and they're
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:57.560]   not." No, none of us are at home. It's just that when we physically move somewhere, it
[00:19:57.560 --> 00:20:05.240]   constantly reminds us we're not home. So that part of it, putting on the shoe of the gospel
[00:20:05.240 --> 00:20:10.160]   of peace, is to have that mentality to constantly be ready that this is not your home. That
[00:20:10.160 --> 00:20:16.360]   one day we will be home in eternity. Until then, we are to go physically, we are to go
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:23.640]   socially, emotionally, and spiritually. Be always ready, wherever God calls us. He says,
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:28.040]   "In all circumstances, take up the shield of faith with which you can extinguish the
[00:20:28.040 --> 00:20:35.040]   flaming darts of the evil one." Why do you need to take up the shield of faith? Because
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:40.240]   you're being set apart from ministry. When the scripture says that you have an adversary,
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:45.320]   like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour, guess who the primary target is going to be?
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:50.640]   Are the people who are the most committed to share the gospel. And so, all of a sudden,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:53.040]   you're going to become a target. Not that you weren't a target before, but you're going
[00:20:53.040 --> 00:20:58.920]   to be a greater target. Because if you become a leader, and you fall, the effects are going
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:04.600]   to be much greater. It's not because we're more special, it's just that there's more
[00:21:04.600 --> 00:21:10.600]   consequences when we fall. So our adversary is going to be targeting anyone who picks
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.560]   up his cross and say, "Here, my son, me." That's why, if you remember Luke chapter 22,
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:20.400]   when Jesus is about to go to the cross, he looks at all the disciples and he said, "Satan
[00:21:20.400 --> 00:21:25.600]   has asked permission to sift you, all of you, like wheat." Because they were the closest
[00:21:25.600 --> 00:21:30.520]   to Christ. He didn't sift everybody. He didn't say, "I'm going to attack everybody." He said
[00:21:30.520 --> 00:21:36.600]   he wanted to attack specifically you guys. Because you guys are the one closest to Christ.
[00:21:36.600 --> 00:21:42.480]   So if there's... So by being ordained, being set apart, and saying, "I'm going to take
[00:21:42.480 --> 00:21:48.400]   on this task," you're putting yourself in a situation where you're going to be attacked.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:51.540]   You're going to be... And it's going to come from all different places. It's going to come
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:57.480]   from places that you don't expect. If you expected, it wouldn't be so discouraging.
[00:21:57.480 --> 00:22:03.400]   But it will come. There are... I don't think there's anything else that we can do where
[00:22:03.400 --> 00:22:09.160]   you're going to become the target of scrutiny more than what you are choosing to do. Okay?
[00:22:09.160 --> 00:22:17.200]   It's too late. You can't back out now. Right? Kill first. Our enemy will first cause you
[00:22:17.200 --> 00:22:26.600]   to doubt God. When discouragements come, when people begin to question you, when you are
[00:22:26.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   not fruitful as you desire, and you're laboring, and you're lonely, and you feel alone, especially
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.040]   because you're going to be on a foreign country, and you're out there with your family, and
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:42.560]   you're having a difficult time, maybe even financially, and you're going to begin to
[00:22:42.560 --> 00:22:50.740]   question, "Is God real? Why is he not answering my prayers? Where's the fruit? I thought if
[00:22:50.740 --> 00:22:55.680]   I came out here, and I just gave myself, and we're going to bear fruit, and you find that
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:23:01.560]   it's not what you thought, Satan is going to attack you. He's going to cause you to
[00:23:01.560 --> 00:23:07.380]   question. And that's why it's so important for us to take up the shield of faith, that
[00:23:07.380 --> 00:23:12.660]   our belief in God does not waver because of circumstance. There's going to be times when
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:18.480]   God's going to make himself so clear to you, and you're going to say, "Thank God." I get
[00:23:18.480 --> 00:23:21.880]   to wake up every morning to be in the Word of God and tell other people, "There's going
[00:23:21.880 --> 00:23:25.600]   to be days when you're going to be, 'Thank God, what a privilege it is to be in this
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:30.080]   position.' And then there's going to be days when you wake up, 'Oh my gosh, I don't know
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:37.040]   if I can do this another day.' And you're going to ask yourself, "Is there another way?"
[00:23:37.040 --> 00:23:40.680]   As Christ agonized, obviously we're nowhere near the agony that he experienced, but as
[00:23:40.680 --> 00:23:45.920]   Christ agonized over what was about to happen, there will be days where you will be able
[00:23:45.920 --> 00:23:52.360]   to understand Jesus. When he cried out, "Lord, is there any other way? But not my will, but
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:57.600]   your will be done." In Numbers 23, 19, it says, "God is not man that he should lie,
[00:23:57.600 --> 00:24:02.840]   nor the Son of Man that he should change his mind. Has he said and will he not do it? Or
[00:24:02.840 --> 00:24:06.720]   has he spoken and will he not fulfill it?" There will be days when you're going to have
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.000]   to cling on to that, and everything inside of you is going to say, "I don't know if this
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:18.520]   is true. He said he promised, but where is the fulfillment? I'm crying out to God, but
[00:24:18.520 --> 00:24:24.920]   where is he?" And that's when you have to remember, you need to take up the shield of
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:33.440]   faith. "Has he said and will he not do it? I believe it. Help my unbelief." Paul says
[00:24:33.440 --> 00:24:39.840]   to Timothy, 2 Timothy 1, 12, "I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed. I am convinced
[00:24:39.840 --> 00:24:43.840]   that he is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted to me." Do you think Paul
[00:24:43.840 --> 00:24:50.600]   never wavered in his faith? I think he did. When he says in Philippines, "I have learned
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:54.640]   the secret of being content in every and all situation." You know what it means by he learned
[00:24:54.640 --> 00:24:59.840]   it? There are times he questioned it. That's why he said he learned it. There are times
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:05.440]   when he was having hardship, and it's like, "What is this? How come I'm an apostle, and
[00:25:05.440 --> 00:25:10.840]   I have to make tents to pay the bills?" You know, in Corinthians, he said, "Go in here,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:17.000]   I have many people, you know, that are mine, and to be courageous and preach the gospel.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:20.760]   And these same people that you told me to go to, now they're questioning my apostleship,
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:30.520]   and they're causing so much pain in my life." And at those times, you must take up the shield
[00:25:30.520 --> 00:25:35.340]   of faith. See, Paul learned it, right? Because he went through hardship. He went through
[00:25:35.340 --> 00:25:42.120]   periods of doubts. And it was at the conclusion of that, he realized that God is always faithful.
[00:25:42.120 --> 00:25:47.120]   He will not only make you doubt about God, our enemy will make you doubt yourself. It's
[00:25:47.120 --> 00:25:53.720]   like, "I believe in God, but maybe I'm not the one. You know, I see all these other people
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:59.440]   who are being fruitful, but why not me? Maybe I'm not cut out for this. Maybe I don't have
[00:25:59.440 --> 00:26:06.440]   the makings of a good pastor." And he's going to begin to poke at all your flaws, I guarantee
[00:26:06.440 --> 00:26:12.480]   you, right? Because we have flaws, right? You know my flaws, I know your flaws. We know
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:18.640]   Pastor Aaron's flaws, right? We know our flaws. But you're in a situation where they're going
[00:26:18.640 --> 00:26:23.400]   to poke at it, right? Our enemy's going to poke at it. And they're going to poke at it
[00:26:23.400 --> 00:26:26.720]   and cause you to doubt yourself. And it is at those times, you take up the shield of
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:30.640]   faith saying, "I didn't come into ministry because I was the most gifted. I didn't come
[00:26:30.640 --> 00:26:34.800]   into ministry because I was the most articulate. I didn't come into ministry because I thought
[00:26:34.800 --> 00:26:40.000]   I was going to be the most successful. I came into ministry because I was convicted that
[00:26:40.000 --> 00:26:46.320]   the gospel was true. And I'm committing to do my part. And in the end, God is going to
[00:26:46.320 --> 00:26:52.520]   do what he's going to do." And you cling to that with all your might, right? To persevere,
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:58.320]   take up the shield of faith. Take up the helmet of salvation. That God's love for you is not
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:03.880]   based on your performance. And that's something that you will wrestle with. And I'm pretty
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:08.440]   sure Pastor Aaron knows what I'm talking about. And every pastor knows what I'm talking about.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:13.600]   That are, just like any other guy, you know, two guys meet together and say, "Hey, what
[00:27:13.600 --> 00:27:17.200]   do you do for a living?" Oh, and then you kind of, you know what I mean? You're secretly
[00:27:17.200 --> 00:27:21.640]   jocking to say, "Oh, I make more money than you do." "What school did you go to?" You
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:26.040]   know, "I went to UCLA." "Oh, I went to a better school than you." It's no different
[00:27:26.040 --> 00:27:30.160]   even in pastorate. You know, you get together and say, "Well, how's your ministry going?
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:35.120]   What's going on with you?" So take up the helmet of salvation. That our foundation is
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:41.560]   not based upon our performance. God's love for you is not based upon your performance.
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:48.520]   God never saved you because of your potential. God saved us because we could not. And that
[00:27:48.520 --> 00:27:55.760]   will never change. That will never change. So our work for Him is just an expression
[00:27:55.760 --> 00:28:02.080]   of our love. Because we want to see the lost saved. And I want to again remind you, Romans
[00:28:02.080 --> 00:28:08.880]   8, 31-36. "If God is for us, who can be against us? He who did not spare his own son, but
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:15.680]   gave him up for us all, how will he not also with him graciously give us all things? Who
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:23.080]   shall bring any charge against God's elect? It is God who justifies. Who is it that condemns?
[00:28:23.080 --> 00:28:27.760]   Christ, Jesus is the one who died. More than that, who was raised? Who is at the right
[00:28:27.760 --> 00:28:31.760]   hand of God? Who indeed is interceding for us? Who shall separate us from the love of
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:38.440]   Christ? Whether your ministry is large and successful, whether you are struggling to
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:45.440]   just hold on to one soul, who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation,
[00:28:45.440 --> 00:28:51.640]   distress, persecution, or famine, or nakedness, or danger, or sword? We must put on the helmet
[00:28:51.640 --> 00:28:59.080]   of salvation. That my identity in Christ does not waver one bit because of what you are
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:05.560]   able to do or not able to do. Once He becomes our Abba Father, He's our Abba Father for
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.280]   eternity. And that's what gives me strength. That's what gives you strength. And when you
[00:29:11.280 --> 00:29:15.560]   get out there and you begin to do ministry again, as you are doing ministry here, that
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:19.560]   you remember this. Take up the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God. And finally
[00:29:19.560 --> 00:29:26.040]   He concludes by saying, "Pray. Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray." If there's anything that
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:31.360]   a minister must commit to do is to pray, pray, pray, pray, pray. Because by praying, we're
[00:29:31.360 --> 00:29:36.200]   coming before the Lord and saying, "All of this is not possible without You." And when
[00:29:36.200 --> 00:29:42.600]   we don't pray, we're indirectly saying, "I can do this." And that's the last lesson that
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:46.600]   any of the disciples needed to learn before he went to the cross. That you're not going
[00:29:46.600 --> 00:29:51.800]   to do it. Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat. And I don't know if Satan
[00:29:51.800 --> 00:29:57.920]   has asked permission to sift you like wheat, but I know from experience and from all the
[00:29:57.920 --> 00:30:04.120]   people who've gone before us, that you will be tested. Your character is going to be tested.
[00:30:04.120 --> 00:30:07.800]   Your ability is going to be tested. Your family is going to be tested. Your relationship with
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:12.120]   your wife is going to be tested. Your children will be tested. Your ministry is going to
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.520]   be tested. You're going to be tested in your 30s. You're going to be tested in your 40s.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:21.400]   You're going to be tested in your 50s. You're going to be tested with your finances. You're
[00:30:21.400 --> 00:30:26.080]   going to be tested in your leisure. You're going to be tested in your pride. You're going
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:30.920]   to be tested in public. You're going to be tested in private. In every aspect of your
[00:30:30.920 --> 00:30:36.440]   life, you will be scrutinized. And in the context of that, if the Holy Spirit is not
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:42.200]   sustaining you, we can't make it. And that's why he says, "Your spirit is willing, but
[00:30:42.200 --> 00:30:48.200]   your flesh is weak. So therefore, cling to Christ in prayer." So this is our encouragement
[00:30:48.200 --> 00:30:55.080]   to you this afternoon. And I ask all of you who are here this afternoon to confirm him.
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:00.120]   It is not because the people who are ordained are some special people that you guys can't
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:07.320]   relate to. And we're not saying that at all. We're same people like you who needed his
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:15.040]   grace to live. We're same sinners who struggle with the same lust, same desire for recognition,
[00:31:15.040 --> 00:31:21.200]   same desire for honor, just like everybody else. If there's anything that's different
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:26.680]   in any way, it's because God was gracious to us and he opened our eyes to see the glory
[00:31:26.680 --> 00:31:30.920]   of the gospel of Jesus Christ. And then that caused us to say, "I want to tell other people
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:36.440]   about this. I want to spend every minute that I have, the rest of my life, to tell other
[00:31:36.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   people about this." And that's why we ask you to pray for him. We ask you to pray for
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:45.000]   him today. We ask you to pray for him when he goes. We ask you to pray for him for the
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:50.320]   rest of your life. So when we're here ordaining him, we're not just ordaining him today and
[00:31:50.320 --> 00:31:55.040]   say, "Well, he's off, so we've done our part." When we're ordaining him, we're going on the
[00:31:55.040 --> 00:31:59.760]   same wagon as him, right? Same thing with Pastor Aaron. When he was being ordained,
[00:31:59.760 --> 00:32:03.520]   Pastor Mark, when he was being ordained, that we're basically saying that even though we
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:08.760]   may be physically apart, by laying hands on him, we're saying, "We're going to get on
[00:32:08.760 --> 00:32:14.880]   the same bandwagon. We're going to get on the same cart from this day on. That I'm going
[00:32:14.880 --> 00:32:18.400]   to be responsible for him. He's going to be responsible for me. And you're going to be
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:23.240]   responsible for him as well." That we're laying hands on him and on behalf of us, representing
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:27.440]   us, he's going to lead. He's going to take the lead in preaching the gospel. So if he
[00:32:27.440 --> 00:32:34.800]   fails, we all in some part will fail. If he fails. And so we need to keep him accountable.
[00:32:34.800 --> 00:32:38.680]   We need to pray for him. And so when we ask the elders and the leaders to come and we're
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:43.000]   going to lay hands and pray for him, obviously we're not going to have you all come and lay
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.360]   hands on him, because you can't. Okay, there's too many people. But spiritually, symbolically,
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.680]   we're all going to lay hands on him. We're all spiritually going to be praying and saying,
[00:32:53.680 --> 00:32:58.640]   "We affirm. We affirm this man's calling in his life and from this day forward, what he
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:03.240]   does, we do with him. If he succeeds, we succeed with him, because we confirmed him. If he
[00:33:03.240 --> 00:33:10.920]   fails, we fail with him, because we confirmed him." And so I pray that again, now as I ask
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:15.000]   his family to come up and ask the elders, including Pastor Aaron, to come up, and we're
[00:33:15.000 --> 00:33:20.480]   going to lay hands on him. We're going to pray for him. Okay, if you can come up. Jan
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:36.440]   and Hadden? I think they're washing him up to be presentable. All right. Okay. Okay,
[00:33:36.440 --> 00:33:50.880]   have a seat.
[00:33:50.880 --> 00:34:09.960]   All right, we're all going to lay hands, and again, please pray with us, and then Elder
[00:34:09.960 --> 00:34:14.920]   Philip, Elder Joe, and Pastor Mark is going to represent us in prayer. But again, as we
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:19.120]   pray, again, if you would have the same spirit that we're laying hands on him, and we're
[00:34:19.120 --> 00:34:24.080]   confirming all together. So we'll have them lead us in prayer.
[00:34:24.080 --> 00:34:37.480]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you that you've put us in this position, Lord God, to witness
[00:34:37.480 --> 00:34:45.880]   and to be a part of sending and also ordaining Pastor Alex and Jan and also Hadden. Father
[00:34:45.880 --> 00:34:55.680]   God, Lord, I just want to pray for their ministry in China as Pastor Alex and the family is
[00:34:55.680 --> 00:35:02.920]   preparing to go. I pray, Lord God, that you would help them in just the practical ways
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:14.200]   of preparing themselves, just leaving the United States and taking the family overseas
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:20.500]   to China. And I pray that all the transition that will occur, all the logistic that needs
[00:35:20.500 --> 00:35:27.040]   to get done will be smooth. I pray, Lord, even just emotionally that you would comfort
[00:35:27.040 --> 00:35:32.520]   them. I know that it's not going to be easy the day that they're traveling overseas, knowing
[00:35:32.520 --> 00:35:38.260]   that they are leaving their family members, everything that they know here in the United
[00:35:38.260 --> 00:35:47.800]   States and building a new life in China where it's a new place. New things, Father God,
[00:35:47.800 --> 00:35:53.080]   people that they don't know, language that they don't understand, people they don't,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:36:00.000]   the culture that is different, Father. But Lord God, we are just wholeheartedly ordain
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:06.680]   Pastor Alex and his family, Lord, to be a minister and a pastor of the gospel so that
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:13.440]   they can bring light, Lord God, to areas that are dark, that needs to hear the gospel, Father.
[00:36:13.440 --> 00:36:19.320]   And I pray, Lord, that you would meet all of their needs, that you would meet all of
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:27.120]   their needs emotionally, physically, financially, in every way, knowing that you are with them,
[00:36:27.120 --> 00:36:32.640]   Father, that you have commanded us to go. But in the end, that you comfort, that you
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.480]   will be with them always to the end of the age, Father. And I pray that that will be
[00:36:37.480 --> 00:36:44.560]   their comfort in times of difficulty, in times of loneliness, times of just questioning,
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:50.520]   Lord, maybe why they're there, Father, that they will feel your presence with them, Lord,
[00:36:50.520 --> 00:36:55.760]   in the most difficult times, knowing that you have called them and they're exactly where
[00:36:55.760 --> 00:37:01.360]   you have placed them, where they should be. And I pray for fruitfulness in their ministry
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:07.600]   in China, Lord. And I thank you, Lord.
[00:37:07.600 --> 00:37:16.120]   Father, we want to lift up our sister Jen to you, Lord, as your child, as your adopted
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:22.960]   daughter, Lord God, I pray that she may continue, Lord God, to be sanctified, that you challenge
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:30.400]   her in so many ways through the support of her husband, through raising Hadan as she
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:34.960]   prepares and as she goes, Lord God, I pray that she may cling to you, Lord God, that
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:41.320]   her relationship with you personally, Lord, may continue to grow with passion, with intensity,
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:46.040]   Lord God, with the desire, Lord, to please you in everything that she is able to do,
[00:37:46.040 --> 00:37:52.720]   Lord God. So I pray as well, Lord God, as a sister, Lord, as she will be meeting and
[00:37:52.720 --> 00:37:58.080]   ministering to other sisters around her, I pray that you help her to be a model example,
[00:37:58.080 --> 00:38:03.560]   Lord God, of faithfulness, of patience, of the fruit of the Spirit, Lord God, that as
[00:38:03.560 --> 00:38:10.840]   she disciples others, that sisters around her may see the light of Christ, her attitude,
[00:38:10.840 --> 00:38:16.240]   Lord God, to be humble, to be like Christ, that in everything that she does in encouraging
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:22.420]   words and in things, Lord God, that she may continue, Lord God, to think with a mindset
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:29.620]   of service, a mindset of doing things out of love. And Lord, as a wife, Lord, we pray
[00:38:29.620 --> 00:38:37.160]   that she continue, Lord, to support Alex as they ventured into a foreign place. And I
[00:38:37.160 --> 00:38:43.640]   know, Lord God, that alone is somewhat stressful, but I pray, Lord God, that as they go together,
[00:38:43.640 --> 00:38:48.660]   Lord, that she may find strength through the relationship that she has with her husband,
[00:38:48.660 --> 00:38:54.760]   that as she supports, as she continues, Lord, to build relationship in a different place,
[00:38:54.760 --> 00:39:00.160]   Lord, I pray that whether they're in China or wherever they are in the world, Lord, that
[00:39:00.160 --> 00:39:04.460]   their relationship may continue to be solid, that their love for one another may continue
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:09.960]   to grow, that their love for one another may continue to support their desire to please
[00:39:09.960 --> 00:39:15.960]   you as a team, as one, Lord God, that the ministry, Lord God, that they both commit
[00:39:15.960 --> 00:39:22.520]   to, Lord God, may be for your glory as well, Lord God, as a mother. We pray, Lord, that
[00:39:22.520 --> 00:39:28.320]   you give her patience, that you help her, Lord God, to be mindful of how and what she
[00:39:28.320 --> 00:39:34.560]   can say and encourage young Haddon, Lord, so, Lord, that she can raise and be a part
[00:39:34.560 --> 00:39:43.680]   of really ministering to her son and really getting the gospel into him to help him, Lord
[00:39:43.680 --> 00:39:51.360]   God, to see just the light of Christ through his interactions with Jen as well, Lord God.
[00:39:51.360 --> 00:39:56.600]   We want to pray for Haddon. We thank you, Lord God, that he brings so much joy to this
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:03.200]   family and, Lord, I know that the most important thing in their minds is that Haddon would
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:10.860]   know Christ and that would come to believing and sanctification and knowledge, Lord God,
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:16.200]   that the gospel is real, that Christ is real, that he may one day see his parents and what
[00:40:16.200 --> 00:40:21.600]   they have committed to do, that he may embrace that as well, that the passion for the lost
[00:40:21.600 --> 00:40:27.920]   may be imparted to him as well, Lord God. We pray for his safety and his continual growth,
[00:40:27.920 --> 00:40:35.160]   both physically, emotionally, and spiritually, Lord, that in the situation for him, I pray
[00:40:35.160 --> 00:40:41.680]   that he may be an obedient child, that he may not bring heartache to his parents, but,
[00:40:41.680 --> 00:40:50.040]   Lord God, that he may bring joy and continued understanding of your love for us, Lord God,
[00:40:50.040 --> 00:40:55.400]   as teaching both Jen and Alex, Lord God, in parenting. So, God, we pray for this family.
[00:40:55.400 --> 00:41:01.600]   We pray for Jen and Haddon, Lord God, as they support and be a part of this ministry and
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:07.480]   be a part of this team as a family, Lord God, that as they venture into this new chapter,
[00:41:07.480 --> 00:41:12.120]   I pray, Lord, for much strength and much commitment to you, Lord God.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:21.120]   >> Heavenly Father, we pray that Pastor Alex and Jen, in their preparation before leaving,
[00:41:21.120 --> 00:41:26.400]   God, that they would have sweet times of prayer with you, that as you prepare them, that you
[00:41:26.400 --> 00:41:32.160]   would prepare their heart to be in a place of humility. God, that Pastor Alex would empty
[00:41:32.160 --> 00:41:37.360]   himself of any selfish ambition to create or produce something of his own accord, but,
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.040]   God, that he would learn through sweet prayer and you would bring his heart to a place of
[00:41:42.040 --> 00:41:47.800]   submission, that he would be ready to do your will, that he would be ready to follow your
[00:41:47.800 --> 00:41:53.240]   lead, and, God, he'd be willing to take the steps and guidance that you provide, Lord.
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:58.920]   And, God, we do know that in the times to come, in the months leading up, that there
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:04.720]   are going to be hardships, perhaps logistical frustrations. I know that they're already,
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:09.960]   right now, busy as it is, and that there are different stresses to come, but now as you
[00:42:09.960 --> 00:42:16.080]   prepare them, God, would you build in them a great confidence not in themselves, but
[00:42:16.080 --> 00:42:20.760]   as they labor, as they strive diligently for your glory, would that be accompanied and
[00:42:20.760 --> 00:42:24.960]   combined with great confidence in the name of Christ. Lord, would you bring them to a
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:31.360]   point of trust, trust in your sovereignty, trust in your character, trust in your presence.
[00:42:31.360 --> 00:42:35.240]   In all things, Father God, we pray that you would fill their hearts with more love for
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:40.840]   Christ, that any sacrifice made, at any time they feel that they're leaving behind too
[00:42:40.840 --> 00:42:45.640]   much, Lord, that these things would be all sacrifices of love to you. God, that their
[00:42:45.640 --> 00:42:49.900]   hearts would be filled with great affection for our Lord and Savior, that when they go
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:54.440]   to preach, that God, they'd be preaching the love of Christ. God, that when they go to
[00:42:54.440 --> 00:42:58.680]   minister, it'd be done for the love of your name. And Father, it's in that great name
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:42:59.680]   we pray, amen.
[00:42:59.680 --> 00:43:00.680]   >> All right.
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:01.680]   >> You want me to take him?
[00:43:01.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   >> Are you gonna take him?
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:03.680]   >> Yeah.
[00:43:03.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   >> Okay.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:25.780]   >> Okay, at this time, we would like to present Pastor Alex with a certificate of ordination
[00:43:25.780 --> 00:43:30.580]   and also a little gift. So I'll go ahead and on behalf of the Berean Community Church,
[00:43:30.580 --> 00:43:34.900]   I will go ahead and read the certificate, okay, and make the presentation. Certificate
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:40.080]   of ordination, we, the elders and members of Berean Community Church, hereby certify
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:47.260]   that Alex Han has been tested and confirmed through years of faithfulness and fruitfulness
[00:43:47.260 --> 00:43:54.980]   to be set apart for the gospel ministry of Jesus Christ. On the 7th of December, 2014,
[00:43:54.980 --> 00:44:00.740]   the following council members, leaders of Berean Community Church, signed by Peter Kim,
[00:44:00.740 --> 00:44:13.780]   Mark Lim, Joseph Chun, and Philip Kim.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:40.740]   >> Thank you. Yeah. Yes. It's like I'm being sent out to war and spiritual battle and you
[00:44:40.740 --> 00:44:48.020]   guys are cheering for me. It's so great. Yeah, I mean, I was trying to think of a way to
[00:44:48.020 --> 00:44:54.780]   sum up just my attitude and just my perspective in all this. And there's just like two points
[00:44:54.780 --> 00:45:00.580]   that I just want to make. And first point I want to make is just how I got here. I remember
[00:45:00.580 --> 00:45:07.380]   when I was in China and I was, I think I was talking with Pastor Aaron over the phone.
[00:45:07.380 --> 00:45:12.900]   Probably Henry probably heard about this too, but it was like a Sunday morning. We didn't
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:17.180]   go to church yet. And so I was talking to Pastor Aaron and then I remember telling him,
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:25.500]   I was like, "You know, for whatever the reason, like I just love God." You know? And it wasn't,
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:31.520]   it's a known fact, you know? It's a known fact. Yeah, I believe it. But there was such
[00:45:31.520 --> 00:45:37.220]   a simplicity to that, to whatever experience I was having at that moment, you know, just
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:44.020]   to have this simple love for God, no strings attached, you know, like, you know, like,
[00:45:44.020 --> 00:45:49.740]   yeah, he saved me, he's blessed me, he's given me all these different things. And just my
[00:45:49.740 --> 00:45:58.820]   response is just, I simply love you. And just thinking about how that simple love is being
[00:45:58.820 --> 00:46:03.940]   manifested now and just coming up to this point of being ordained and now, you know,
[00:46:03.940 --> 00:46:10.980]   thinking about China and missions and trying to start a church, it really is just a manifestation
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:17.860]   of this simple love for God and a desire to share this simple love with everyone that
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:25.940]   I know. And I'm just utterly humbled and amazed to see how much that love for God could carry
[00:46:25.940 --> 00:46:34.260]   me through. And I'm genuinely wondering, will this love carry me through once more? And
[00:46:34.260 --> 00:46:39.220]   I think with confidence I can say, yes, it will carry me through.
[00:46:39.220 --> 00:46:42.140]   My second point, I was just trying to think, yeah, like, people are asking me, "So how
[00:46:42.140 --> 00:46:44.740]   do you feel like being ordained?" And I'm like, "I don't know, I never went through
[00:46:44.740 --> 00:46:49.980]   it before." I'm only expecting to be ordained once, so I'm like, I don't know how I'm gonna
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:56.540]   feel. But if I can sum it up in two words, it's answered prayers. And it's not my answered
[00:46:56.540 --> 00:47:02.260]   prayers, it's really the answered prayers of a lot of different people at our church.
[00:47:02.260 --> 00:47:10.140]   I am the result of your prayers. And I think knowing that should stir up the body of Christ,
[00:47:10.140 --> 00:47:15.580]   to stir up the faith to have in Him, that He does answer prayers. Like, when Pastor
[00:47:15.580 --> 00:47:20.340]   Peter comes up and says, "You need to pray to God to raise up more workers to be sent
[00:47:20.340 --> 00:47:26.740]   out to the harvest," tonight, this is like the manifestation of that prayer being answered.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:31.220]   You know? I'm one of those workers. And there's gonna be many more workers that are gonna
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:36.180]   be raised up as a result of answered prayers. And so when Pastor Peter was saying, "You
[00:47:36.180 --> 00:47:40.860]   gotta pray, pray, pray," I'm looking at my life and I'm like, I'm the result of
[00:47:40.860 --> 00:47:48.620]   answered prayers many times over. And it just humbles me. It points to the fact that I can't
[00:47:48.620 --> 00:47:55.380]   be here without the support of God and the support of this church. And I am absolutely
[00:47:55.380 --> 00:47:59.420]   excited. You know, I know school is gonna end for me pretty soon, and I'm excited about
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:06.900]   that. I'm like, yes, no more driving up 70 plus miles, you know, twice a week. But I'm
[00:48:06.900 --> 00:48:13.100]   actually more excited to start the work in China. It's been seven years waiting, praying,
[00:48:13.100 --> 00:48:18.340]   preparing, and to finally come to the manifestation of like actually going. I'm gonna be like,
[00:48:18.340 --> 00:48:24.620]   man, I'm just gonna be praising God, you know, every day. And so I'm utterly humbled, I'm
[00:48:24.620 --> 00:48:29.860]   grateful, I am the result of your answered prayers, and I'm only praying that our church
[00:48:29.860 --> 00:48:35.300]   would pray more so that we could raise up more workers to be sent out into the harvest.
[00:48:35.300 --> 00:48:40.860]   You know, yes, our family needs prayer, yes, our family needs financial support for this
[00:48:40.860 --> 00:48:48.460]   move to China. But more than us, the work itself needs more people. And I'm taking open
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:53.540]   calls right now to be sent out to China. You don't have to wait. If you want to join the
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:58.820]   team, you can join the team now. So I'm just letting you guys know. Anyways, that's it.
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:00.180]   I'm done. Thank you very much.
[00:49:00.180 --> 00:49:03.360]   (audience applauding)
[00:49:03.360 --> 00:49:06.360]   (audience clapping)
