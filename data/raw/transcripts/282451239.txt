[00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   [applause]
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   Last year, Captain Corc next sport won against Nemesis of Genesis
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   and spread the gospel across the galaxy.
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   Nemesis even accepted Christ and picked up his cross.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   This year, the 2018 Marines Summer Olympics are about to begin!
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   So countries such as Wakanda, Kuala, Pani, Scrantonia, and Maria
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   may begin to compete at the highest level.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   [music]
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Well, church! It's a fine day for the 2018 Marine Olympics!
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   I'm your host, Miss Announcer!
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   Behind me, we have the top athletes from around the galaxy,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   each representing their home planet.
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   No surprise to find that no matter what size, shape, or color of our skin,
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   our same love for sports unites us.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Join us today as we watch the athletes compete in the three-legged race at the jump rope.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Now, in lane one, we have...
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   the...
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   Cavendish Savage and the Kualan!
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   In lane two, the...
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Wakandan!

[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   And in lane five, Pani.
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   Now, as the racers and the Olympians get ready for their events,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   let's all cheer for the teams that you would like to win.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   Now, racers, on your mark, get set, go!
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   And they're off! And the Kualans are definitely beating everybody in the athlete world!
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:16.000]   [cheering]
[00:02:16.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   What an astonishing victory from the Kualans!
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Wow, there's so many strong, skilled, and smart athletes here.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   How will I even survive?
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Whoa!
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   Hey, watch where you're going!
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:38.000]   Yeah, watch it.
[00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Sorry, I didn't mean to.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Hey, hey, hey, you didn't mean to.
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Watch where you're going, okay? Do you even belong here?
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Yeah, what are you doing here anyway?
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Look at yourself.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Do you look like an Olympian?
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   Have you looked at yourself lately?
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:55.000]   Dude, stop copying me.
[00:02:55.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Dude, stop copying me.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Hey, knock it off. It's a competition.
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   [music]
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   [music]
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   What do you want?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Is this yours?
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   [music]
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   You're right. They're so strong like the Egyptians.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   You can never beat them.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   They do look pretty strong, huh?
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:42.000]   You know what? I'm confident that our God is stronger than the Egyptians and their armies
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   and those people who made fun of us.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   You know why?
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   Because God always wins.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   Come on, let's pray.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   Dear God, even though this strong may hurt us,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   you are the greatest and the most almighty.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Please deliver us. In your name we pray.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Amen.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:16.000]   [music]
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   [music]
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   [music]
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   [music]
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   You're right. God always wins.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   Let's chant.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   God always wins.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   [laughter]
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   What are you guys doing?
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:34.000]   God always wins. God always wins.
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   Yeah, what's up with that?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   Ew, wait. What's on your arms and your faces?
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   Oh, you have boils everywhere.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   You have so many boils.
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   You're ugly.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   No, you guys are ugly.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   I'm ugly.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   I can't go out looking like this. Not with the next competition.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And the boils on my feet hurt so bad.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   What? Hey, don't be a little princess.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   Yeah, man up.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   You're right. I'm like a little puberty, stomach for win, gold medal.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   Okay.
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   Now, as the athletes prepare for the next event, the jump rope competition,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   we're going to have the competitors from the Bereans and the Wakandans and the Koalans.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   And as they set up, who do you think will win?
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   All right.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   So first, the Scrantonians and the Pawnee are going to go against each other.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   Ooh, ooh, close competition.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   Who's going to--oh, that--wow, what a sad loss for Pawnee.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   Next in the competition, the Bereans versus the Koalans.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   All right, looks close.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   Who's going to give up first?
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   Will it be the Bereans?
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   Oh, there's locusts everywhere.
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Oh, no, the locusts are too great for the Koalans, and they lost.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Wow, God does always win.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   And no one can ever resist him.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Thanks for helping me.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   What's your name again?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   I'm Anna Banana.
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   I'm Keeley, Keeley Seeley.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   Come on.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   I'm going to jump the giant and try to defend the jump.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.000]   Ooh, yeah, let's do it.
[00:07:38.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And there you have it.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   Anna Banana and Keeley Seeley have gained one point,
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   and they will be advancing to the next round of games.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   Who will be awarded for the gold medal this year?
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   Will Anna Banana be able to win tomorrow's competition
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and beat Cabbage the Savage?
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   Find out tomorrow in the first ever before ultra super amazing event
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   at the first Oregon Olympic Games.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   [applause]
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   (audience cheering)
