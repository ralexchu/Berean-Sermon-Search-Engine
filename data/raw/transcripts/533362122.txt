[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.360]   - Good morning, everyone.
[00:00:11.360 --> 00:00:14.920]   My name is Joanne and I'm a second year student at UCI.
[00:00:14.920 --> 00:00:18.600]   I've been at Berean for a little over a year now and today I'm going to share my testimony
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.440]   of how I came to know Christ.
[00:00:22.440 --> 00:00:26.160]   I was blessed to have been raised in a Christian household and because of my background, I
[00:00:26.160 --> 00:00:30.640]   grew up thinking that my Christian faith was inherited like a family trait, something that
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.120]   couldn't be shaken because I was born into it.
[00:00:33.120 --> 00:00:37.360]   I partook in church activities that I believed would solidify my role as a true Christian.
[00:00:37.360 --> 00:00:41.540]   I attended Sunday school, went on several mission trips, helped organize fellowship
[00:00:41.540 --> 00:00:45.200]   and volunteer events, and took communion alongside my family.
[00:00:45.200 --> 00:00:50.000]   Back then, I perceived these acts of service as demonstrations of my definite salvation.
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.720]   I thought to myself, "I mean, I'm doing things because I love Jesus, right?"
[00:00:53.720 --> 00:00:58.920]   I believed in a work-based salvation and even got baptized in 2011 at the age of 10 after
[00:00:58.920 --> 00:01:02.680]   reflecting that these good deeds must equal the marks of a true Christian.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:05.920]   However, my faith was tested when I entered high school.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.200]   I started to depend on the new friendships I made at church for my spiritual health and
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:13.720]   continuously felt more and more distant from God whenever each of our mission trips was
[00:01:13.720 --> 00:01:14.720]   over.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.600]   Following the splitting of my home church and seeing as a result people get close to
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.080]   me, get hurt, and step away from the church, I questioned the validity of Christianity
[00:01:22.080 --> 00:01:26.440]   and ultimately God's sovereignty over his children if Christians still had the ability
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:30.000]   to hurt each other and act in opposition to what his word laid down.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.080]   I began to feel discouraged from seeking out any further contact with church and eventually
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:37.400]   stopped attending church during my freshman year of high school.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.440]   I would identify myself as a Christian when asked, but truthfully, I lived my life like
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.760]   a non-believer and I only sought to live for my own fleshly desires.
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:49.600]   My skepticism of the church carried over to my first quarter at UCI.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.680]   I began to get caught up in the college life that I had yearned for, making reckless decisions
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:57.200]   and trying to forge a new identity under bad influences.
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.680]   Strangely enough, however, I was never completely satisfied in my pursuit of the things I thought
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:03.360]   would make me happy.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:07.240]   By God's grace, my disappointment in pursuing things other than Christ reminded me even
[00:02:07.240 --> 00:02:12.960]   more of his constant presence, of the hope and joy that is found only in him.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:16.480]   In hindsight, I can now fully see how God was working in my life through the people
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:18.960]   he sovereignly placed in my life.
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:22.520]   Even amidst this whirlwind kind of college environment in which I was exposed to a lot
[00:02:22.520 --> 00:02:27.240]   of new temptations, by God's grace, he grew a desire in me to know him more and to understand
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.720]   what it meant to be reconciled to him.
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.760]   Early last year, I happened to bump into my suite mate who had just come back from an
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:36.000]   event led by a parachurch called CCM.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.160]   After telling her how I was curious about finding a local church, she immediately invited
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.540]   me to a CCM meeting the following night.
[00:02:42.540 --> 00:02:46.440]   It was through the parachurch that I first heard of Breein, and I was immediately challenged
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:50.720]   as I interacted with Christ-centered college students who lived out their faith.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:54.440]   As I began attending Breein regularly and learning more about Christianity through inductive
[00:02:54.440 --> 00:02:58.520]   Bible studies and Sunday services, God began to convict me to read the word and give me
[00:02:58.520 --> 00:03:01.520]   a renewed understanding on who Jesus Christ was.
[00:03:01.520 --> 00:03:05.120]   I began to grow in my faith even throughout the pandemic, learning about God's divine
[00:03:05.120 --> 00:03:10.120]   holiness as well as the riches of his divine mercy and grace in the gospel.
[00:03:10.120 --> 00:03:13.960]   I was convicted by the weight of sin, which are transgressions against the holy God who
[00:03:13.960 --> 00:03:17.160]   commands us to walk in the light as he himself does.
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.320]   Christ's death and resurrection atone for these transgressions, and for this we must
[00:03:20.320 --> 00:03:24.440]   confess our sins as he is faithful and cleanses us from all unrighteousness.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.280]   As I contemplated this new truth, I was continuously humbled by the knowledge of God's love.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:33.240]   Even though God knows the true depths of my sin, he still gave up his son to pay the penalty
[00:03:33.240 --> 00:03:36.680]   for my sin so I can be reconciled and have peace with him.
[00:03:36.680 --> 00:03:40.440]   There is no amount of work or service I could do to earn my salvation, and it was only by
[00:03:40.440 --> 00:03:42.240]   his grace through faith.
[00:03:42.240 --> 00:03:46.160]   And because of this new knowledge, I now have a desire to worship him, love him, and follow
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:47.460]   him.
[00:03:47.460 --> 00:03:50.840]   Although I tried to push God away numerous times throughout my life, looking back I can
[00:03:50.840 --> 00:03:55.280]   truly see his loving kindness to the encouraging brothers and sisters I met over the past year,
[00:03:55.280 --> 00:03:59.320]   who continuously spur me on to grow more in the knowledge of the Savior who died on the
[00:03:59.320 --> 00:04:03.080]   cross and now calls me to follow him.
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:06.960]   My decision to be baptized 10 years later comes with a new understanding of Jesus' death
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:12.920]   and resurrection, as well as my new confidence in affirming his lordship over my life.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:17.360]   A verse that is especially encouraging to me is Galatians 2.20.
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.000]   I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   in me.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.920]   And the life which I now live in the flesh, I live by faith in the Son of God, who loved
[00:04:25.920 --> 00:04:27.640]   me and gave himself up for me.
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:28.640]   Thank you.
[00:04:28.640 --> 00:04:35.640]   [applause]
