[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.600]   Today, because Thanksgiving is on Thursday and we want to really prepare our hearts and
[00:00:13.600 --> 00:00:20.520]   also think through the facet of thankfulness and gratitude in our hearts, I've prepared
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.080]   a sermon pertaining to this topic of Thanksgiving, but the way I've entitled it is "So Thankful
[00:00:27.080 --> 00:00:28.920]   for Good Reason."
[00:00:28.920 --> 00:00:34.760]   And the reason why is because as I took a moment to think about this topic, I asked
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:38.520]   myself the question, "Hmm, I am thankful.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:42.560]   I'm super grateful for the many things that are happening in my life, but I have been
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:44.800]   Christian now for some time.
[00:00:44.800 --> 00:00:49.000]   Have I been maturing and growing in my thankfulness?"
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:52.600]   Or on the flip side of it, I just started kind of asking, "Or have I become just pretty
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:54.880]   accustomed to Christian life?
[00:00:54.880 --> 00:00:58.340]   And although I'm grateful, it's just not that deep."
[00:00:58.340 --> 00:01:02.320]   And as I started to think about that, there was a kind of fear in me.
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.360]   And the reason why is because, yes, I am grateful, but clearly the scriptures calls us as Christians
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.240]   to be the most grateful of all people.
[00:01:11.240 --> 00:01:18.280]   It calls us to really be overjoyed, to rejoice always, and to have this gratitude that's
[00:01:18.280 --> 00:01:21.080]   overflowing to God.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:26.920]   But then, there's a part of me that wonders, "Have I become so, again, accustomed and trained?
[00:01:26.920 --> 00:01:29.080]   My thankfulness is a lot like politeness.
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:30.080]   It's a lot like etiquette.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.520]   You know, three times a day, every time you eat, you say the prayer, 'Thank you for this
[00:01:34.520 --> 00:01:35.520]   food.
[00:01:35.520 --> 00:01:36.520]   Thank you for this day.
[00:01:36.520 --> 00:01:39.220]   In Jesus' name, I pray,' kind of rhymes."
[00:01:39.220 --> 00:01:42.200]   And it just goes, right?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:45.720]   It just goes every meal and every day.
[00:01:45.720 --> 00:01:49.040]   And the fear is not so much because, "Oh, man, I ought to be more thankful."
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:56.840]   The fear is because if I am thinking about my God appropriately, if I do that, it could
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.320]   potentially be offensive.
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:01.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.860]   That if the Lord truly has given us such a blessing in all the heavenly realm, such a
[00:02:06.860 --> 00:02:13.960]   treasure that it's His very presence and it's the gift of His most precious Son, and the
[00:02:13.960 --> 00:02:20.240]   best I can give to Him is politeness, although I'm trying, it could end up being one of those
[00:02:20.240 --> 00:02:25.080]   things where although I am trying, it can be offensive.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:29.880]   Because the Scripture has called us to a state of mind where we are literally spilling over
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:36.040]   with gratitude because God has so filled our hearts and our lives with blessing upon blessing,
[00:02:36.040 --> 00:02:39.080]   lavishing His love.
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:41.880]   And so as I started to think about this, I started having this mentality.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:43.940]   I was like, "Oh, goodness.
[00:02:43.940 --> 00:02:48.680]   I need to ask myself the question, 'How deep is my gratitude and my appreciation for the
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.220]   Lord?
[00:02:50.220 --> 00:02:52.080]   Is it fitting?
[00:02:52.080 --> 00:02:54.920]   Is it appropriate to what I know of God?'"
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:55.920]   Right?
[00:02:55.920 --> 00:02:56.920]   That's the question.
[00:02:56.920 --> 00:02:58.440]   "Is it appropriate to what I know of God?
[00:02:58.440 --> 00:03:00.920]   Is it appropriate to my relationship with Him?"
[00:03:00.920 --> 00:03:03.460]   And that's the way I want to challenge us today.
[00:03:03.460 --> 00:03:09.320]   So please turn your Bibles over to Luke chapter 7, verse 36 through 47.
[00:03:09.320 --> 00:03:13.600]   Luke chapter 7, verse 36 through 37.
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:19.120]   And again, my assumption is should you have been a Christian long enough, you know you
[00:03:19.120 --> 00:03:22.960]   ought to be thankful, and I assume that you are.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:26.360]   The challenge is not so much stop being so ungrateful and spoiled.
[00:03:26.360 --> 00:03:31.760]   The challenge is from where you are, how deep has your gratitude gone?
[00:03:31.760 --> 00:03:37.240]   From where you are in your faith, is your gratitude maturing, deepening, widening, and
[00:03:37.240 --> 00:03:40.760]   all the more growing with your understanding of God?
[00:03:40.760 --> 00:03:46.400]   So starting from verse 36, the Scripture says this.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:50.400]   "One of the Pharisees asked him," that is Christ, "to eat with him.
[00:03:50.400 --> 00:03:54.240]   And he went into Pharisee's house and reclined at the table.
[00:03:54.240 --> 00:03:59.540]   And behold, a woman of the city, who was a sinner, when she learned that he was reclining
[00:03:59.540 --> 00:04:04.280]   at the table in the Pharisee's house, brought an alabaster flask of ointment.
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:09.640]   And standing behind him at his feet, weeping, she began to wet his feet with her tears,
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:13.680]   and wiped them with the hair of her head, and kissed his feet, and anointed them with
[00:04:13.680 --> 00:04:14.960]   ointment.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.960]   And when the Pharisee who had invited him saw this, he said to himself, 'If this man
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:24.080]   were a prophet, he would have known who and what sort of woman this is who is touching
[00:04:24.080 --> 00:04:25.120]   him.
[00:04:25.120 --> 00:04:28.600]   For she is a sinner.'"
[00:04:28.600 --> 00:04:30.160]   Oh, I'm sorry.
[00:04:30.160 --> 00:04:31.160]   Totally.
[00:04:31.160 --> 00:04:32.160]   Oh, sorry.
[00:04:32.160 --> 00:04:33.160]   "For she is a sinner.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.400]   And Jesus answering him said, 'Simon, I have something to say to you.'
[00:04:37.400 --> 00:04:39.760]   And he answered, 'Say it, teacher.'
[00:04:39.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   A certain moneylender has two debtors, one owed five hundred denarii, and another fifty.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:48.520]   When they could not pay, he canceled the debt of both.
[00:04:48.520 --> 00:04:50.880]   Now which of them will love him more?'
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:54.760]   Simon answered, 'The one, I suppose, for whom he canceled the larger debt.'
[00:04:54.760 --> 00:04:58.080]   And he said to him, 'You have judged rightly.'
[00:04:58.080 --> 00:05:02.280]   Then turning toward the woman, he said to Simon, 'Do you see this woman?
[00:05:02.280 --> 00:05:03.640]   I entered your house.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:05.920]   You gave me no water for my feet.
[00:05:05.920 --> 00:05:09.560]   But she has wet my feet with her tears, and wiped them with her hair.
[00:05:09.560 --> 00:05:14.580]   You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in, she has not ceased to kiss my feet.
[00:05:14.580 --> 00:05:19.360]   You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:22.760]   Therefore I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven.
[00:05:22.760 --> 00:05:28.400]   For she loved much, but he who is forgiven little, loves little."
[00:05:28.400 --> 00:05:30.440]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:05:30.440 --> 00:05:37.320]   All right, God, we want to thank you for your precious word.
[00:05:37.320 --> 00:05:42.600]   We want to thank you because as our heavenly Father, you are teaching us what it means
[00:05:42.600 --> 00:05:44.680]   to be thankful.
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:50.260]   Father God, we want to repent of the fact that, yes, in many seasons of life and in
[00:05:50.260 --> 00:05:57.440]   many ways, we can be so absent-minded, forgetful, and inconsiderate of the fact that we owe
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:58.440]   you our gratitude.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.720]   But thank you again, Lord, that you lead us in the spirit.
[00:06:01.720 --> 00:06:08.080]   I pray, more than anything, God, you would open our eyes to just see, to see the reality,
[00:06:08.080 --> 00:06:12.280]   the spiritual picture of your relationship with us.
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:16.520]   And God, from seeing the whole scenario, we would just lavish, Father God, and we would
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:18.440]   respond to you with thankfulness.
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:20.440]   It's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:06:20.440 --> 00:06:21.440]   Amen.
[00:06:21.440 --> 00:06:29.920]   So again, thankfulness, the way that Jesus is describing it, it's pretty simple, right?
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.840]   I mean, all it is is essentially you receiving something as a grace gift from God, right?
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:38.760]   So you're receiving something, and so you're thankful, okay?
[00:06:38.760 --> 00:06:41.400]   But remember, today, we're talking about the depth of your gratitude.
[00:06:41.400 --> 00:06:45.640]   We're talking about how you can grow and expand in your gratitude.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:51.600]   And so I want to say, even just that simple picture of how you are supposed to receive
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.340]   and then be thankful, that can grow.
[00:06:54.340 --> 00:06:58.880]   Because depending on how you see yourself in the picture, depending on how you see your
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:01.840]   need, did I need that gift?
[00:07:01.840 --> 00:07:06.160]   Depending on your deficiency, you're going to grow in the depth of your gratitude.
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:09.680]   Depending on what it is you actually think you received, right?
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:14.040]   Depending on the actual gift itself, depending on the act of grace that you receive, you're
[00:07:14.040 --> 00:07:15.960]   going to grow in your gratitude.
[00:07:15.960 --> 00:07:21.840]   But most importantly, depending on the person you see, the one who's giving it to you, you're
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.980]   going to grow in your gratitude.
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:27.440]   And so in those three ways, I'm going to walk down them one by one now.
[00:07:27.440 --> 00:07:30.560]   I want to challenge you to grow in our gratitude.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:33.720]   And essentially, as I go through that, you're going to recognize very clearly, we're just
[00:07:33.720 --> 00:07:35.880]   rehearsing the gospel.
[00:07:35.880 --> 00:07:41.200]   Rehearsing the gospel and its narrative about who you are prior to knowing God, the amazing
[00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:45.080]   gift that you have, and then being able to actually know him.
[00:07:45.080 --> 00:07:49.760]   Now first, the way I want to phrase it is, I am so thankful because, because I want to
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:51.720]   express my gratitude too.
[00:07:51.720 --> 00:07:55.200]   I'm so grateful because I am deeply undeserving.
[00:07:55.200 --> 00:07:58.760]   Because I'm absolutely undeserving.
[00:07:58.760 --> 00:08:03.800]   I want to show you by this story and parable, and the incident when Jesus enters into the
[00:08:03.800 --> 00:08:08.800]   Pharisee's house, what Jesus is emphasizing by his parable.
[00:08:08.800 --> 00:08:13.720]   So in his Antidote, he essentially gives us this amazing principle of life.
[00:08:13.720 --> 00:08:18.720]   In verse 47, he said, "He who is forgiven little, loves little."
[00:08:18.720 --> 00:08:22.800]   That's a principle he's saying, there is a direct correlation here.
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.880]   You think you've been forgiven this, your gratitude is this.
[00:08:26.880 --> 00:08:29.200]   Direct correlation.
[00:08:29.200 --> 00:08:33.600]   For our purposes, we can use a synonymous term, much forgiven, much thankful.
[00:08:33.600 --> 00:08:36.960]   On the flip side, little forgiven, little thankful.
[00:08:36.960 --> 00:08:40.540]   But I want us to take a second look at that passage, because there's so much more to glean
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:45.560]   in terms of where Jesus is pointing the finger at the error in the whole scenario.
[00:08:45.560 --> 00:08:46.560]   What do I mean?
[00:08:46.560 --> 00:08:52.000]   Well, starting from verse 40 again, Jesus answered Simon, because Simon said something.
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.160]   There's a thought like, "What in the world?
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:56.400]   You know who this girl is?"
[00:08:56.400 --> 00:08:58.800]   And Jesus answers and says, "I've got something to say to you."
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:00.560]   He said, "Say it."
[00:09:00.560 --> 00:09:04.440]   Verse 41, "A certain money lender had two debtors.
[00:09:04.440 --> 00:09:08.200]   He owed five, one owed 500 denarii and the other 50.
[00:09:08.200 --> 00:09:11.360]   When they could not pay, he canceled the debts of both.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:14.560]   Now which one of them will love him more?"
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:18.760]   Okay, so there's the impetus for our question of growing deeper, right?
[00:09:18.760 --> 00:09:20.480]   There is a gradient.
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:23.680]   There's a degree to which one should be more grateful.
[00:09:23.680 --> 00:09:28.760]   And Simon answered, "The one I suppose for whom he canceled the larger debt."
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.880]   And Jesus said to him, "You have judged rightly."
[00:09:31.880 --> 00:09:36.920]   Then now turning to the woman, he said to Simon, "Do you see this woman?
[00:09:36.920 --> 00:09:38.160]   I entered your house.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:42.860]   You gave me no water for my feet, but she has wet my feet with tears and wiped them
[00:09:42.860 --> 00:09:43.960]   with her hair.
[00:09:43.960 --> 00:09:49.480]   You gave me no kiss, but from the time I came in, she has not ceased to kiss my feet.
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.320]   You did not anoint my head with oil, but she has anointed my feet with ointment.
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:10:02.400]   Therefore, I tell you, her sins, which are many, are forgiven, for she loved much."
[00:10:02.400 --> 00:10:05.920]   Okay, the error in the scenario.
[00:10:05.920 --> 00:10:10.560]   The error in the scenario is not so much that the Pharisees said, "Look at that woman.
[00:10:10.560 --> 00:10:12.080]   She's a city woman."
[00:10:12.080 --> 00:10:13.080]   Right?
[00:10:13.080 --> 00:10:14.080]   That's what they call her.
[00:10:14.080 --> 00:10:15.080]   "She's a sinner."
[00:10:15.080 --> 00:10:18.400]   Why do I say that's not the error?
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.020]   Because even Jesus says, "Her sins are many."
[00:10:21.020 --> 00:10:25.640]   As a matter of fact, the narrative in the story says, "There was this sinner who came."
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.200]   There's an affirmation of the fact that their sins are many.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:29.280]   So what is the flaw?
[00:10:29.280 --> 00:10:31.440]   What is the error here?
[00:10:31.440 --> 00:10:37.680]   It is the mentality of the Pharisee to presume, "I'm the sinner with the 50 denarii debt."
[00:10:37.680 --> 00:10:39.640]   There's two debtors.
[00:10:39.640 --> 00:10:45.200]   Why do you automatically assume you're not the guy with more?
[00:10:45.200 --> 00:10:48.400]   When you say, "She's a sinner," it betrays you.
[00:10:48.400 --> 00:10:49.400]   Why?
[00:10:49.400 --> 00:10:52.480]   Because you say that with the assumption and you're not.
[00:10:52.480 --> 00:10:54.680]   What am I talking about here?
[00:10:54.680 --> 00:10:58.140]   Remember my point here is this.
[00:10:58.140 --> 00:11:06.240]   When we see the depth of our sin, when we see the kind of weight and gravity of our
[00:11:06.240 --> 00:11:12.040]   own wretchedness, there is automatically going to be an appreciation for God's grace.
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:20.800]   Should you assume, "Oh, what I got was this nice help that I could have used, might have
[00:11:20.800 --> 00:11:27.960]   done well with, but I didn't necessarily need," your thankfulness will never be appropriate
[00:11:27.960 --> 00:11:31.080]   to what God has given you.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:34.520]   And so to talk about that a little bit, I think there is this kind of dangerous mantra
[00:11:34.520 --> 00:11:36.520]   of today's culture.
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:40.640]   I hear it in the songs, I hear it sometimes on the radio when I listen.
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:45.760]   And the mentality is, you know, we're all hurt people and all we need is love.
[00:11:45.760 --> 00:11:49.160]   I'm not sure if you've heard that.
[00:11:49.160 --> 00:11:53.320]   It's kind of sentiment and mentality of our modern culture where they believe all we need
[00:11:53.320 --> 00:11:54.320]   is love.
[00:11:54.320 --> 00:11:56.920]   And what I'm going to say to that is, it is true.
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.800]   Every single one of us needs love.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:06.520]   We were built with the capacity to love, God desires to show His love, and we need it.
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:12.280]   But something that's a little off is, is that really all you need?
[00:12:12.280 --> 00:12:15.420]   Take a moment to think about that and chew on it.
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:16.420]   What more could we need?
[00:12:16.420 --> 00:12:20.620]   Well, I have one, holiness.
[00:12:20.620 --> 00:12:27.040]   Because when I say this is what I need, it presumes who I am prior, right?
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:31.920]   We absolutely need righteousness because we're unrighteous.
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:37.800]   We need holiness because we have such depravity, wickedness, and evil within us.
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:40.220]   Let me have you chew on something else for a little bit.
[00:12:40.220 --> 00:12:45.880]   Imagine this, we know through the gospel that we have the certificate of death.
[00:12:45.880 --> 00:12:50.280]   We essentially have a ledger with the red markings of our sin.
[00:12:50.280 --> 00:12:54.480]   We're absolutely in transgression, okay?
[00:12:54.480 --> 00:12:55.880]   Imagine by the grace of God, He says, "You know what?
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.640]   I'm not going to hold that against you."
[00:12:58.640 --> 00:13:05.960]   Does He still have to accept you into His kingdom?
[00:13:05.960 --> 00:13:13.160]   For people who have no righteousness of your own, you need Christ's righteousness.
[00:13:13.160 --> 00:13:18.400]   Should Jesus not give to us His righteousness, what righteousness do we have?
[00:13:18.400 --> 00:13:22.900]   Even if we went from negative three billion to zero, what righteousness do we have?
[00:13:22.900 --> 00:13:28.480]   What meritous kind of advantageous, what anything do we have to show the Lord?
[00:13:28.480 --> 00:13:31.180]   The answer is nothing.
[00:13:31.180 --> 00:13:32.920]   We need His righteousness.
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.200]   We need not only His righteousness, we need His mercy.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:42.040]   Because should we believe we are criminals who have transgressed law, I need mercy.
[00:13:42.040 --> 00:13:46.280]   I need sustenance because I'm a child, I'm an infant, and I don't know how to take care
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:47.280]   of myself.
[00:13:47.280 --> 00:13:52.280]   I need His provisions daily, right?
[00:13:52.280 --> 00:13:54.500]   There's so much more that I need.
[00:13:54.500 --> 00:13:56.740]   Why am I talking about this?
[00:13:56.740 --> 00:13:59.900]   Because yes, it's true, you do need love.
[00:13:59.900 --> 00:14:02.500]   But if you thought, "You know, that's all I need."
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:10.100]   My admonition to you is going to be, "No, your need is so much deeper."
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:14.300]   Everything you have, you don't have the power to even sustain it.
[00:14:14.300 --> 00:14:16.580]   You could lose it all.
[00:14:16.580 --> 00:14:19.980]   Everything you are right now, you owe to the mercies of God.
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:22.700]   All His gracious acts to you were just that.
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:27.200]   Everything has been merciful, gracious acts to you.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:33.340]   And for you, you are to feel, "And I absolutely needed every ounce of it."
[00:14:33.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   Right?
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:37.620]   They were not just good and nice stuff that we received.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.420]   And that's why I want to read to you this passage, 1 Corinthians 4, verse 6-7.
[00:14:42.420 --> 00:14:47.300]   Apostle Paul says, "Now these things, brethren, I have figuratively applied to myself and
[00:14:47.300 --> 00:14:52.380]   Apollos for your sake, so that in us you may learn not to exceed what is written, so that
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:56.500]   no one of you will become arrogant in behalf of one against another.
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.860]   For who regards you as superior?
[00:14:58.860 --> 00:15:02.160]   What do you have that you did not receive?
[00:15:02.160 --> 00:15:08.340]   And if you did receive it, why do you boast as if you had not received it?"
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:11.220]   That's an important phrase for us to understand.
[00:15:11.220 --> 00:15:18.020]   So, I have this thought I want to share with you, that not only then are we supposed to
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:24.740]   appreciate the depth of our sin, but in that light then, we of all people should know the
[00:15:24.740 --> 00:15:28.100]   difference of the value of the merciful gifts that we receive.
[00:15:28.100 --> 00:15:32.900]   What I'm talking about is, in the parable that Jesus is saying, there is a clear difference
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:35.700]   between 500 and 50.
[00:15:35.700 --> 00:15:37.540]   Right?
[00:15:37.540 --> 00:15:42.020]   Now in order to communicate this a little bit more, I want to share with you sometimes,
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.940]   there are moments when I kind of worry, when I hear people's testimony.
[00:15:46.940 --> 00:15:50.960]   What am I talking about that I worry hearing people's testimony?
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.620]   Sometimes I talk to individuals and they have this testimony where they share.
[00:15:55.620 --> 00:15:58.980]   When I ask them, "When did it really make sense to you?
[00:15:58.980 --> 00:16:00.540]   When did the good news hit you?
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:02.220]   This is good news."
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:07.100]   And they'll say, "Yeah, I was in high school, I was a senior, so much was changing.
[00:16:07.100 --> 00:16:10.680]   I didn't get into the school that I want, my friends were leaving, it was such a rough
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:12.460]   patch, but God helped me through it."
[00:16:12.460 --> 00:16:17.620]   Okay, I heard that and I said, "Hmm, did you say a rough patch?"
[00:16:17.620 --> 00:16:19.700]   It's like, "Yeah, it was so rough."
[00:16:19.700 --> 00:16:21.700]   It's like, "What do you mean by rough?"
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:27.220]   It's like, "You know, I was changing because I had so much expectations, I was disappointed,
[00:16:27.220 --> 00:16:33.140]   I was wrestling with pressure, just the burden of my parents, and then things happening,
[00:16:33.140 --> 00:16:39.620]   and there were so many hurdles, but God helped me through every hurdle."
[00:16:39.620 --> 00:16:42.740]   Is that good news to you?
[00:16:42.740 --> 00:16:44.700]   I want you to take a moment to think about that.
[00:16:44.700 --> 00:16:47.220]   Is that good news to you?
[00:16:47.220 --> 00:16:53.820]   The reason why I worry is because if the good news of the gospel to you surmounts to God
[00:16:53.820 --> 00:17:01.980]   helping you hurdle obstacles, you will never be thankful enough, and you will be in danger
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:04.380]   of offending God.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:09.900]   Now when I say that, I don't say that to diminish people's experience, because if God helps
[00:17:09.900 --> 00:17:13.220]   you in the time of need, should you give honor and thank him?
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:14.220]   Yes.
[00:17:14.220 --> 00:17:19.420]   Praise his name, because every season of your life, you're going to need his help.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:20.420]   Amen?
[00:17:20.420 --> 00:17:21.420]   But you understand my point.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.420]   I'm not trying to minimize the story, I'm not trying to minimize the suffering, I'm
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.620]   not trying to minimize the hardship.
[00:17:28.620 --> 00:17:35.460]   But you of all people should be able to tell the difference between 500 and 50.
[00:17:35.460 --> 00:17:40.380]   You and I as believers should know the difference between eternity with God in heaven versus
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:46.360]   overcoming two years of suffering, overcoming my senior year in high school, overcoming
[00:17:46.360 --> 00:17:52.860]   that weird stage when I was changing, being forgiven so that you no longer face the wrath
[00:17:52.860 --> 00:17:59.260]   of God in all eternity in hell versus having the power to go through hardship, pains, and
[00:17:59.260 --> 00:18:01.500]   sorrows.
[00:18:01.500 --> 00:18:08.020]   You should be able to tell the difference, and your gratitude should match the difference.
[00:18:08.020 --> 00:18:10.060]   That's the point, right?
[00:18:10.060 --> 00:18:15.580]   And so I want to give you this matter of admonition, our thankfulness, our thankfulness has to
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:18.700]   be spiritually exercised.
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:24.260]   And we see the value, not just simply because of what people around us are experiencing,
[00:18:24.260 --> 00:18:27.820]   because I see the value of my need, of my desperate need.
[00:18:27.820 --> 00:18:32.580]   And when are we then going to be like this woman who has this incredible joy, incredible
[00:18:32.580 --> 00:18:34.340]   gratitude?
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:39.900]   Do you think she was crying like that because now she got out of the city?
[00:18:39.900 --> 00:18:40.900]   I don't think so.
[00:18:40.900 --> 00:18:41.900]   Right?
[00:18:41.900 --> 00:18:44.700]   I don't think so.
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:49.340]   And so that's why I say as a challenge to every single one of us, our challenge to grow
[00:18:49.340 --> 00:18:54.860]   in our gratitude is a challenge to accept the depth of our undeserving nature, of our
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:19:00.300]   wretchedness, and therefore to see the great need that God has filled.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:05.520]   And so to highlight that, there's a special verse in Luke chapter 18 where Jesus highlights
[00:19:05.520 --> 00:19:06.520]   this mentality.
[00:19:06.520 --> 00:19:10.620]   Luke 18 verses 10 through 14.
[00:19:10.620 --> 00:19:16.340]   Two men went up into the temple to pray, one a Pharisee and the other a tax collector.
[00:19:16.340 --> 00:19:21.180]   The Pharisee stood and was praying this to himself, "God, I thank you.
[00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.900]   I want you to take a moment to recognize that.
[00:19:23.900 --> 00:19:25.780]   The Pharisee also thanks the Lord."
[00:19:25.780 --> 00:19:26.780]   Okay?
[00:19:26.780 --> 00:19:32.380]   And he says, "That I am not like the others, swindlers, unjust, adulterers, or even like
[00:19:32.380 --> 00:19:34.100]   this tax collector.
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:35.300]   I fast twice a week.
[00:19:35.300 --> 00:19:37.700]   I pay tithes of all that I get.
[00:19:37.700 --> 00:19:43.980]   But the tax collector, standing some distance away, was even unwilling to lift up his eyes
[00:19:43.980 --> 00:19:49.140]   to heaven, but was beating his breast saying, 'God, be merciful to me, the sinner.'
[00:19:49.140 --> 00:19:53.340]   I tell you, this man went to his house justified rather than the other.
[00:19:53.340 --> 00:20:01.520]   For everyone who exalts himself will be humbled, but he who humbles himself will be exalted."
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:08.740]   If we are growing as Christians over the years, we should all of a sudden be more in tune
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:11.400]   with the variety of our deficiency.
[00:20:11.400 --> 00:20:16.980]   We should all the more see the dependency of our lives, that we absolutely need every
[00:20:16.980 --> 00:20:21.860]   ounce of grace, and that the depth of our wretchedness only then inspires the gratitude
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:25.060]   to see his extensive works.
[00:20:25.060 --> 00:20:29.340]   And so I want to move to the second point, that I'm so thankful because of his extensive
[00:20:29.340 --> 00:20:32.540]   works of grace towards me.
[00:20:32.540 --> 00:20:36.820]   Because if you were to just focus on your then deep, deep pit of depravity, you would
[00:20:36.820 --> 00:20:38.740]   be depressed, rightly so.
[00:20:38.740 --> 00:20:40.660]   Look at this.
[00:20:40.660 --> 00:20:42.540]   There's nothing more.
[00:20:42.540 --> 00:20:47.460]   But it's in that light, in that reality, we see the extensive works of God, then we can
[00:20:47.460 --> 00:20:50.620]   grow in love and we can grow in thankfulness.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:57.060]   I want to remind you, the scripture says that God's love is not only deep, but he wants
[00:20:57.060 --> 00:20:59.860]   us to understand the breadth, right?
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:01.340]   It's so wide and varied.
[00:21:01.340 --> 00:21:05.260]   And what I'm talking about here is if you have been Christian for some time, are you
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:10.420]   growing in the knowledge and breadth of the kind of works that God has accomplished?
[00:21:10.420 --> 00:21:16.020]   Are you growing in your appreciation for the details of what he has done?
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:18.020]   How patient he has been?
[00:21:18.020 --> 00:21:20.820]   How meticulously he's been planning our salvation?
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:25.460]   That his redemptive plan was not any kind of fluke like, "You know what?
[00:21:25.460 --> 00:21:27.100]   I think today I'll save some people."
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:32.020]   That is not the way God has worked in history and that is not the way he's working now.
[00:21:32.020 --> 00:21:37.660]   Remember that God is taking people from the kingdom of darkness, from the reign of Satan,
[00:21:37.660 --> 00:21:39.420]   to the kingdom of light.
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.540]   Remember that he's taking rebellious enemies of God and making them friends of the Lord.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:52.140]   He's taking you, he's taking me from being abandoned, abandoned children, children of
[00:21:52.140 --> 00:21:56.180]   the devil, to then adopted sons and daughters.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:22:01.820]   He's taking us, those who are lifeless, decaying corpse to abundant fullness of life.
[00:22:01.820 --> 00:22:06.100]   He is removing your sins far from you.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:09.580]   Only to learn in scripture when he says, "I'm removing it," he's taking that sin and placing
[00:22:09.580 --> 00:22:12.420]   it and nailing it right on the cross.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.260]   Right now what I did is just two minutes go through various avenues by which God has worked.
[00:22:17.260 --> 00:22:22.380]   My question to you is, if someone asks you, "Why are you so thankful for the faith that
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:23.380]   you have?
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:25.300]   Why are you so thankful for the salvation that you have?"
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:30.900]   And the best you can say is, "Well, I know Jesus came, died, and left."
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:34.940]   The depth of your gratitude is only going to be that.
[00:22:34.940 --> 00:22:40.540]   And yes, surely enough, that alone is going to be causing you tons of praise and glorious
[00:22:40.540 --> 00:22:42.540]   songs of thanksgiving.
[00:22:42.540 --> 00:22:44.860]   But you need to grow.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.020]   You need to grow in the understanding of his grace and his work towards us.
[00:22:50.020 --> 00:22:57.780]   I want to read to you Psalm 107, verses 1 through 7, which says this, "Oh, give thanks
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.340]   to the Lord for he is good, for his loving kindness is everlasting.
[00:23:02.340 --> 00:23:08.700]   Let the redeemed of the Lord say, 'So whom he has redeemed from the land of the adversary,
[00:23:08.700 --> 00:23:12.360]   and gathered from the land, from the east, from the west, from the north, from the south.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:14.840]   They wandered in the wilderness, in the desert region.
[00:23:14.840 --> 00:23:17.340]   They did not find a way to an inhabited city.
[00:23:17.340 --> 00:23:18.940]   They were hungry and thirsty.
[00:23:18.940 --> 00:23:20.720]   Their soul fainted within them.
[00:23:20.720 --> 00:23:23.020]   Then they cried out to the Lord in their trouble.
[00:23:23.020 --> 00:23:25.220]   He delivered them out of their distress.
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.880]   He led them also by a straight way to go to an inhabited city.
[00:23:29.880 --> 00:23:35.900]   Let them give thanks to the Lord for his unfailing love and his wonderful deeds for mankind.
[00:23:35.900 --> 00:23:40.220]   For he satisfies the thirsty, and he fills the hungry with good things."
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:47.020]   Man, I ask myself, am I growing and maturing and understanding?
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:52.700]   And I want to share with you, this is to our joy that we get to grow in this fashion with
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:53.700]   God.
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:24:00.380]   It's to your great joy that you get to constantly learn, my God is my creator.
[00:24:00.380 --> 00:24:05.800]   To experience, my God is my defender, he's my sustainer, he's my shepherd, right?
[00:24:05.800 --> 00:24:10.040]   To all these things, it is to our benefit to grow in every single fashion, to learn
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:13.860]   he is my judge who's going to vindicate, he's going to be the righteous one who will lead
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:15.300]   my path.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:17.240]   All of that is to our benefit.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.400]   All of that is to my benefit.
[00:24:19.400 --> 00:24:24.380]   Now here's an area that I want to just highlight for you because there is another danger that's
[00:24:24.380 --> 00:24:27.480]   super subtle, which is this.
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:29.960]   I have now been Christian for 20 years.
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.800]   I've been a pastor for like eight or nine years, you know?
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:35.540]   I've been preaching on the pulpit pretty regularly.
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.200]   So if you were to ask that question, "Do you know these things?"
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:44.160]   Well, my answer, I'm not trying to be prideful, I'm going to be like, "Yes, I preached it."
[00:24:44.160 --> 00:24:50.520]   But then there's that question, "Why then do I find that sometimes my gratitude more
[00:24:50.520 --> 00:24:56.840]   feels like etiquette than a deep felt appreciation that's moving me?
[00:24:56.840 --> 00:24:58.800]   Why?"
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:04.820]   And I wonder if you can relate to me and ask that same question, like, "I know the stuff.
[00:25:04.820 --> 00:25:06.520]   I know the rationale."
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:08.200]   He says, "Be thankful for a good reason."
[00:25:08.200 --> 00:25:09.440]   I know the reasons.
[00:25:09.440 --> 00:25:11.300]   What's the difference?
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:18.580]   Sometimes it's just small, small, narrow, narrow, like I would say, error in belief
[00:25:18.580 --> 00:25:19.580]   that could trip us up.
[00:25:19.580 --> 00:25:22.960]   And in order to highlight that, I want to give you an example, okay?
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.520]   I don't know if some of you guys are like major romantics in here.
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.440]   Unfortunately, I'm not, but I wish I was more.
[00:25:30.440 --> 00:25:34.740]   Now imagine that you are a crazy romantic and to the girl that you like, or for you
[00:25:34.740 --> 00:25:37.460]   husbands, to your wife, you're like, "You know what?
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:38.460]   It's our special day.
[00:25:38.460 --> 00:25:40.180]   Maybe it's anniversary, Valentine's Day.
[00:25:40.180 --> 00:25:42.620]   I'm going to go all out."
[00:25:42.620 --> 00:25:46.020]   So you tell your special lady, "Hey, you don't have to lift a finger.
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:47.660]   I'm going to plan ahead."
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:51.720]   And so you plan ahead, you carve out a time, you make the day.
[00:25:51.720 --> 00:25:55.680]   And then not only do you plan out the day, you pick the venue, you decide to hire people
[00:25:55.680 --> 00:25:56.900]   to go decorate that thing.
[00:25:56.900 --> 00:26:00.280]   So you, you know, use some of the college students here and you're just like, "I'll
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:01.280]   pay you with food."
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:05.480]   And then you have them go decorate this place with streamers and pedals and stuff like that.
[00:26:05.480 --> 00:26:07.120]   And there's candles and stuff.
[00:26:07.120 --> 00:26:08.960]   And they do a great job.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:12.400]   And then, not only that, but for food, you plan it out.
[00:26:12.400 --> 00:26:13.660]   You're not a good cook.
[00:26:13.660 --> 00:26:16.760]   And therefore, you even plan to have it tested.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:20.360]   You do a run through with all the ingredients, you make someone test it, and they're like,
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:21.800]   "This is good."
[00:26:21.800 --> 00:26:22.800]   And then you're like, "That's it."
[00:26:22.800 --> 00:26:24.760]   And then you go and you go prepare this thing.
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:28.800]   You do the whole spread, you turn on the music, everything's beautiful.
[00:26:28.800 --> 00:26:31.860]   Day comes and then she comes in, she's like, "Wow.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:33.960]   This is, this is good."
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:34.960]   Right?
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:37.960]   And you're just kind of like, "Huh?
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   Huh?"
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   You know?
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:41.640]   And you're just like, "Wow, this is good."
[00:26:41.640 --> 00:26:47.720]   But to your surprise, out of, you know, what should be gratitude, she should say something
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:48.960]   like, "Thank you so much."
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:52.000]   But instead she says, "Good job, man.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Now you finally get it."
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   Yeah.
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:57.280]   I say, "What?"
[00:26:57.280 --> 00:27:00.720]   Imagine if she said in response to all that, like, "Good job.
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:01.880]   You're finally doing your job."
[00:27:01.880 --> 00:27:05.920]   What would you say?
[00:27:05.920 --> 00:27:06.920]   I wouldn't even know what to say.
[00:27:06.920 --> 00:27:10.480]   I'd just be like, "I guess dinner's done, 'cause I'm not even gonna..."
[00:27:10.480 --> 00:27:11.480]   Right?
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.960]   'Cause you just feel like so underappreciated.
[00:27:12.960 --> 00:27:16.280]   What am I talking about here?
[00:27:16.280 --> 00:27:22.860]   See, we could see all of God's work and you could see all of his wondrous plans.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:26.920]   But if in your heart you think God is just doing his duty towards you, your thankfulness
[00:27:26.920 --> 00:27:28.480]   will never be there.
[00:27:28.480 --> 00:27:32.760]   If you believe God is just fulfilling his responsibilities to you as God, and then when
[00:27:32.760 --> 00:27:35.120]   he doesn't, you look up and you're like, "What are you doing?
[00:27:35.120 --> 00:27:37.720]   What are you doing with my life?"
[00:27:37.720 --> 00:27:38.720]   Right?
[00:27:38.720 --> 00:27:42.200]   If you treat the Lord that way, I hope you don't treat people that way, but I hope you
[00:27:42.200 --> 00:27:45.520]   realize that sometimes we are in danger of treating God that way.
[00:27:45.520 --> 00:27:49.280]   I see everything you're doing, but good.
[00:27:49.280 --> 00:27:50.840]   This is good.
[00:27:50.840 --> 00:27:51.840]   No.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:57.680]   I want us to remember, God doesn't even have to listen to us.
[00:27:57.680 --> 00:28:06.880]   When I ask him for something and I pray, there is no obligation that is infringed upon God
[00:28:06.880 --> 00:28:10.200]   that he has to listen to me.
[00:28:10.200 --> 00:28:14.480]   And so in that way, when you see the vast array of his mercies and works of grace towards
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:18.320]   you, thank him for every single one of them.
[00:28:18.320 --> 00:28:19.680]   Right?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:21.960]   Thank him for every single one of them.
[00:28:21.960 --> 00:28:27.920]   And then what's more, I want to move to our third point, which is I am even more so thankful
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:31.680]   because of his absolute greatness.
[00:28:31.680 --> 00:28:36.280]   God, in his person, he is powerful.
[00:28:36.280 --> 00:28:37.680]   He is loving.
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:38.680]   He is gracious.
[00:28:38.680 --> 00:28:40.380]   He is comforting.
[00:28:40.380 --> 00:28:45.040]   To have him is the greater picture.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:50.400]   I want to remind you that yes, learning about our depravity and our wretchedness deepens
[00:28:50.400 --> 00:28:53.480]   your understanding of your thankfulness.
[00:28:53.480 --> 00:28:55.360]   It heightens your gratitude.
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:28:59.680]   And yes, seeing all the little works, all the big works, all the various things God
[00:28:59.680 --> 00:29:03.600]   has done, it heightens your gratitude.
[00:29:03.600 --> 00:29:09.440]   But the biggest piece of the puzzle is God.
[00:29:09.440 --> 00:29:12.720]   Biblical thankfulness, you've heard this probably before.
[00:29:12.720 --> 00:29:15.160]   Count your blessings, right?
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:16.880]   You might be having a rough season in your life.
[00:29:16.880 --> 00:29:20.120]   You might be going through some struggles and people say to you, "You got to really
[00:29:20.120 --> 00:29:21.640]   just count your blessings."
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   That's true.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:23.640]   It's not bad advice.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:29.520]   You should look for the blessings and you should count them.
[00:29:29.520 --> 00:29:33.440]   But if that's all you do, you missed the big picture.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:37.320]   All you did is bean counting and you're not going to feel good after that.
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:40.520]   Count the beans, right?
[00:29:40.520 --> 00:29:43.760]   What you should do is you should look to God.
[00:29:43.760 --> 00:29:48.400]   He is the greatest source, the greatest power.
[00:29:48.400 --> 00:29:54.080]   In your relationship to Him, He is your greatest answer, He is your greatest comfort to whatever
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:57.240]   it is you need.
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:30:00.640]   He has been your full supply and more.
[00:30:00.640 --> 00:30:02.800]   He's the biggest picture.
[00:30:02.800 --> 00:30:08.400]   You know what's really interesting is not too long ago, someone asked me, "Is it wrong
[00:30:08.400 --> 00:30:10.640]   to be angry with God?"
[00:30:10.640 --> 00:30:12.520]   I thought, "Hmm."
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:15.200]   They said, "Yeah, I'm not like jettisoning the faith.
[00:30:15.200 --> 00:30:19.840]   I'm not going to run away and throw him to the curb, but is it wrong to pray in anger
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:20.840]   to God?
[00:30:20.840 --> 00:30:23.160]   What do you think?"
[00:30:23.160 --> 00:30:25.040]   And so I sat there and did my thing.
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:27.000]   I wrote the question and I started, "Hmm."
[00:30:27.000 --> 00:30:30.360]   I was like, "Hmm, let me look for all the places in the Bible I remember people are
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:31.360]   mad."
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.440]   And I was like, "Oh, there's a lot of mad people in the Bible."
[00:30:33.440 --> 00:30:34.440]   Remember Jonah?
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   He was super mad, right?
[00:30:35.480 --> 00:30:38.120]   He was like, "I'm so mad I could die."
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.120]   And then he went off and sat in the sun.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:44.120]   That's what he did, right?
[00:30:44.120 --> 00:30:47.360]   So I was tempted to be like, "I guess you can."
[00:30:47.360 --> 00:30:48.360]   And then I went, "No."
[00:30:48.360 --> 00:30:51.120]   And then I said, "You know what?
[00:30:51.120 --> 00:30:52.840]   This is my answer to you.
[00:30:52.840 --> 00:30:53.840]   That's stupid."
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:57.600]   Now, I don't like using the word because it's a little harsh, but let's just use the word
[00:30:57.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   maybe foolish.
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.560]   This is absolutely foolishness.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:05.400]   So when you start asking the question, "Can I do this in this context?"
[00:31:05.400 --> 00:31:07.360]   I'm not sure if you're seeing the big picture.
[00:31:07.360 --> 00:31:13.120]   And that's what I mean by God is the biggest reality.
[00:31:13.120 --> 00:31:17.000]   We're talking about God.
[00:31:17.000 --> 00:31:19.080]   With a word, he will create the universe.
[00:31:19.080 --> 00:31:20.760]   And with a word, he will destroy it.
[00:31:20.760 --> 00:31:23.320]   And you're sitting there like, "Do you think I could be angry with him?
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:27.800]   I'm not sure if that is the right question.
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.800]   Let's just ask you, 'Are you mad?'"
[00:31:30.800 --> 00:31:35.920]   And then maybe someone could counter-argue and say, "Well, now we're children of God.
[00:31:35.920 --> 00:31:41.700]   As a son, shouldn't I have the open door to go to God in this fashion?"
[00:31:41.700 --> 00:31:43.800]   And my thought is, "No.
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:47.640]   If you are a child of God, you should know better than anybody else.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:50.960]   This is God Almighty.
[00:31:50.960 --> 00:31:54.240]   And this Almighty God is the person you have."
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:31:56.800]   And that's why we're forever thankful.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:58.840]   You don't have things that you can run away with.
[00:31:58.840 --> 00:32:03.520]   You don't have things where we have the tendency to appreciate the gift and forget the giver.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:06.800]   Let me show you an example.
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:09.880]   Turn over to Luke 17, verses 11 through 19.
[00:32:09.880 --> 00:32:13.400]   And Jesus tells this kind of funny story that we made into a children's song.
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:16.560]   I'm sure you guys are aware of it.
[00:32:16.560 --> 00:32:21.680]   And what Jesus says is, "On the way to Jerusalem, he was passing along between Samaria and Galilee.
[00:32:21.680 --> 00:32:26.060]   And as he entered a village, he was met by 10 lepers who stood at a distance and lifted
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:30.240]   up their voices, saying, 'Jesus, Master, have mercy on us.'
[00:32:30.240 --> 00:32:33.840]   When he saw them, he said to them, 'Go and show yourself to the priests.'
[00:32:33.840 --> 00:32:35.600]   And as they went, they were cleansed.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:40.240]   Then one of them, when he saw that he was healed, turned back, praising God with a loud
[00:32:40.240 --> 00:32:41.240]   voice.
[00:32:41.240 --> 00:32:45.440]   And he fell on his face at Jesus' feet, giving thanks to him.
[00:32:45.440 --> 00:32:47.200]   Now he was a Samaritan.
[00:32:47.200 --> 00:32:52.400]   Then Jesus answered, 'Were there not 10 lepers cleansed?
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.040]   Where are the nine?'
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:58.640]   Was no one found to return and give praise to God except this foreigner?'
[00:32:58.640 --> 00:33:00.780]   And he said to him, 'Rise and go your way.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:02.080]   Your faith has made you well.'"
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:07.660]   Remember, we are susceptible to be so excited.
[00:33:07.660 --> 00:33:12.380]   I don't think all of these lepers were just so ungrateful, spoiled people who were just
[00:33:12.380 --> 00:33:14.400]   like, "Bah, forget you."
[00:33:14.400 --> 00:33:18.400]   They were just so excited about being healed because they knew their depravity.
[00:33:18.400 --> 00:33:19.400]   They knew they were unclean.
[00:33:19.400 --> 00:33:21.740]   They had to say it, "I'm unclean."
[00:33:21.740 --> 00:33:22.740]   They had to be isolated.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:24.140]   They couldn't participate.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:27.660]   They knew their whole lives they were unclean.
[00:33:27.660 --> 00:33:35.960]   They're so excited about their healing, they ran off and didn't appreciate the giver.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:38.900]   That's just my point, a simple point.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.720]   All the more we have to appreciate the giver of the gifts.
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:49.460]   So with that said, I want to challenge us to the depths of the thankfulness that you
[00:33:49.460 --> 00:33:51.420]   have.
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:54.240]   What are you thinking about?
[00:33:54.240 --> 00:33:56.380]   What are you dwelling upon?
[00:33:56.380 --> 00:33:58.020]   What are you meditating on?
[00:33:58.020 --> 00:34:01.260]   That your gratitude towards God would rise.
[00:34:01.260 --> 00:34:07.180]   Yes, it's not going to be perfect because we know, "Lord, I'm not going to fully see
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:09.420]   this because you're God.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:13.260]   But in as much as you've shown me, thank you so much."
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:16.960]   Now beyond that, not only do I want to say you need to grow in that kind of fashion,
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:20.260]   what I'm going to do now is quickly, quickly go through.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:26.780]   If your heart is thankful, may we not be like the scenario where only one out of ten comes
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:31.940]   back because in our hearts we have to express it.
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:34.140]   What we feel we have to show.
[00:34:34.140 --> 00:34:37.940]   In our relationship with God, we have to reveal, "God, this is my heart.
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:40.560]   I love you."
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:47.900]   And that's why scripture calls us to overflow, overflow with gratitude, to always be grateful
[00:34:47.900 --> 00:34:51.300]   because this is the Lord's will for us.
[00:34:51.300 --> 00:34:54.740]   Now what I want to say then is this.
[00:34:54.740 --> 00:34:59.420]   By way of the expression then, as you recognize what the Lord has done, as we recognize who
[00:34:59.420 --> 00:35:04.940]   he is to us, I want you to think about the woman at the dinner table.
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:06.860]   I want you to think about her.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:13.980]   And I'll give you three, three very fast expressions of gratitude that every single one of us can
[00:35:13.980 --> 00:35:14.980]   grow in.
[00:35:14.980 --> 00:35:15.980]   Okay?
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:19.900]   First, is to bless the Lord, to bless the Lord.
[00:35:19.900 --> 00:35:25.580]   I want you to think back with me at the woman, the woman from the city, the sinner who came
[00:35:25.580 --> 00:35:26.580]   in.
[00:35:26.580 --> 00:35:31.060]   She came in and she knew that he was reclining there and she knew that this was an intense
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:32.060]   scenario.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.060]   I just want you to understand that the scenario was kind of intense because the Pharisees
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:40.380]   are religious leaders of the time and they already felt threatened.
[00:35:40.380 --> 00:35:41.540]   Yes?
[00:35:41.540 --> 00:35:44.080]   Jesus was a controversial figure.
[00:35:44.080 --> 00:35:48.860]   To jump into this meeting would be kind of like if, let's say, our church leadership
[00:35:48.860 --> 00:35:53.180]   was in a heated debate with another camp and we were going at it or something like that.
[00:35:53.180 --> 00:35:56.100]   I mean, obviously, it doesn't sound like they were going at it here, but then you didn't
[00:35:56.100 --> 00:35:59.580]   know what's happening and you just walked in and you're like, "Oh," and you slowly close
[00:35:59.580 --> 00:36:01.400]   the door, right?
[00:36:01.400 --> 00:36:06.260]   To want attention in an arena, no one would want that kind of attention.
[00:36:06.260 --> 00:36:08.720]   Why do I bring this up?
[00:36:08.720 --> 00:36:12.780]   The risk this lady took, it must have been worth it.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:13.980]   Listen to you then.
[00:36:13.980 --> 00:36:16.980]   What did she accomplish?
[00:36:16.980 --> 00:36:18.700]   You get my flow of thought, right?
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.180]   High risk scenario for a sinning lady who pretty much had a reputation because everybody
[00:36:23.180 --> 00:36:29.460]   somehow knew her to come into this arena where there is religious leaders of the time having
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:35.940]   this dinner to make a scene as high risk must have been worth it.
[00:36:35.940 --> 00:36:39.840]   Then what did she accomplish?
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:42.420]   What did she accomplish?
[00:36:42.420 --> 00:36:48.540]   My point to you is she wanted to accomplish nothing more than to bless her savior.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:53.740]   She wasn't there to go make a case, "I'm fighting for the ladies in the city.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.980]   I'm going to fight for their..."
[00:36:54.980 --> 00:36:57.560]   She didn't go in there doing that.
[00:36:57.560 --> 00:37:02.660]   She didn't go in there to correct the Pharisees and say, "You religious leaders, look what
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:09.340]   you're doing to us, heavily burdening us, basically condemning us."
[00:37:09.340 --> 00:37:13.080]   She wasn't there on a corrective rant.
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:16.300]   She came to bless her savior.
[00:37:16.300 --> 00:37:19.060]   When you see the picture, you just start picturing it.
[00:37:19.060 --> 00:37:23.700]   This lady came in and she humbled herself to the point where she didn't even feel the
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:25.140]   right to come in front of him.
[00:37:25.140 --> 00:37:27.560]   Did you notice that it says she was by her feet?
[00:37:27.560 --> 00:37:31.180]   She was washing it, but she did it from behind him.
[00:37:31.180 --> 00:37:38.840]   She lowered herself and blessed him with the ointment, with her tears, and with her love.
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:44.540]   If there are ways for us to grow in our gratitude, let us grow in this.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:48.940]   And that's why scriptures in Psalm chapter 103 says, it commands us, "Bless the Lord,
[00:37:48.940 --> 00:37:53.860]   O my soul, and all that is within me, bless his holy name.
[00:37:53.860 --> 00:37:59.460]   Bless the Lord, O my soul, and forget not all his benefits, who forgives all our iniquity,
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:05.540]   who heals all our diseases, who redeems your life from the pit, who crowns you with steadfast
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:13.140]   love and mercy, who satisfies you with good so that your youth is renewed like the eagle's."
[00:38:13.140 --> 00:38:14.620]   Wow.
[00:38:14.620 --> 00:38:15.620]   That's awesome.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:21.060]   What an inspiration for us to show our Lord our gratitude just by blessing him with our
[00:38:21.060 --> 00:38:23.900]   praise, with our tears.
[00:38:23.900 --> 00:38:29.340]   And what's more, secondly, we can express our gratitude by boasting in God.
[00:38:29.340 --> 00:38:31.140]   By boasting in God.
[00:38:31.140 --> 00:38:37.500]   If it so fills your heart, if it so edifies, if it so refreshes your soul, it's going to
[00:38:37.500 --> 00:38:39.420]   come out in your words, right?
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:42.900]   And what the scripture says is beyond just saying, "Oh, thank you."
[00:38:42.900 --> 00:38:45.540]   It wants us to literally boast.
[00:38:45.540 --> 00:38:47.180]   Takes us out on the next passage.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:53.460]   In Psalm chapter 44 verse 8, it says, "In God we have boasted all day long, and we will
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:38:55.780]   give thanks to your name forever."
[00:38:55.780 --> 00:38:58.660]   Say, "Lord, think about it.
[00:38:58.660 --> 00:39:01.820]   Think on that."
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.580]   The next passage here is Psalm 9 verse 1 through 2.
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:06.900]   "I'll give thanks to the Lord with all my heart.
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:08.540]   I'll tell of all your wonders.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.500]   I will be glad and exult in you.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:16.260]   I'll sing praise to your name, O Most High."
[00:39:16.260 --> 00:39:19.940]   What I want to share with you is, man, I feel like in this generation, people want to be
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:21.580]   experts in their field.
[00:39:21.580 --> 00:39:22.920]   People want to know.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:25.880]   People want to be able to communicate that they're experts in their field.
[00:39:25.880 --> 00:39:28.220]   So we got guys who are experts at sports.
[00:39:28.220 --> 00:39:30.020]   We got guys who are experts at cars.
[00:39:30.020 --> 00:39:32.060]   We got guys who are experts at this and that.
[00:39:32.060 --> 00:39:38.460]   If there is anything you are wanting to boast about, boast about this, scripture says,
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:42.260]   that you know the Lord, that he knows you.
[00:39:42.260 --> 00:39:45.500]   This is one of the greatest ways for you to show your appreciation for God.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   Amen?
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:48.940]   Now, the next part of it is this.
[00:39:48.940 --> 00:39:55.060]   Express your gratitude towards God by giving all of yourself to him.
[00:39:55.060 --> 00:39:56.620]   Give yourself fully to the Lord.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:40:02.540]   Now, as I talk about this, I want to say, we see that the scriptures show us that there
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:04.140]   is this growing gratitude.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:07.580]   So I want you to think about times when you've been really thankful.
[00:40:07.580 --> 00:40:11.700]   I know that some of you guys receive birthday cards and then everybody, you know, Facebook
[00:40:11.700 --> 00:40:13.140]   posts and you're just thankful.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:16.460]   Like, man, people really, sometimes they think of you.
[00:40:16.460 --> 00:40:19.540]   And then so when they send you a card, you're like, "Thanks for thinking of me."
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:22.700]   You know, and then you just want to show your gratitude like that.
[00:40:22.700 --> 00:40:23.700]   That's thankfulness.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.860]   Very good.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.580]   And then there's a level up thankfulness.
[00:40:27.580 --> 00:40:31.540]   When you're just like so thankful, it kind of moves you to tears.
[00:40:31.540 --> 00:40:35.500]   About two weeks ago, there was a wedding and then the maid of honor was the sister of the
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:39.120]   bride and then they were giving the speech.
[00:40:39.120 --> 00:40:42.340]   And then when they give the speech, it's like emotionally really intense, but they start
[00:40:42.340 --> 00:40:48.460]   talking about like, "Thank you, like that life lived together, all the moments of like
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:49.460]   help you gave me."
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:52.460]   And then they start crying and I'm sitting there like, "Don't cry."
[00:40:52.460 --> 00:40:55.740]   You know, like, "Oh no."
[00:40:55.740 --> 00:40:59.300]   Because I get moved by stuff like that because I grew up and my older brother, he's about
[00:40:59.300 --> 00:41:00.500]   four or five years older.
[00:41:00.500 --> 00:41:03.380]   He's been like the best brother in the world.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.060]   And then, you know, it's like, you know how it is sometimes it just moves you.
[00:41:08.060 --> 00:41:10.540]   And I just sit in there like, "Oh man."
[00:41:10.540 --> 00:41:14.100]   And I gave a speech at my brother's wedding, he gave a speech at mine.
[00:41:14.100 --> 00:41:19.420]   And I'm so thankful for him because you think about the longevity of the years together.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:23.500]   It's hard not to cry, you know, especially moments of milestone.
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:25.940]   You're just so grateful, it moves you to tears.
[00:41:25.940 --> 00:41:28.700]   When was the last time like that for you?
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:33.220]   But did you know there's a level up beyond that, what I like to call the ugly cry?
[00:41:33.220 --> 00:41:35.940]   Because I see some of you guys at the weddings, right?
[00:41:35.940 --> 00:41:41.060]   When you go to meet your parents after you go and do the unicandle and they say the groom
[00:41:41.060 --> 00:41:44.140]   and the bride are going to come and thank the parents and they go over to the parents
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:45.140]   and it's just like, "Yeah."
[00:41:46.140 --> 00:41:50.580]   And you do the ugly cry and you're just like, you know, everyone's watching you, you know,
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:54.940]   the parents' faces facing that way, your face is just like right there.
[00:41:54.940 --> 00:41:59.260]   But you're just so thankful, you can't help but ugly cry.
[00:41:59.260 --> 00:42:04.020]   But there is actually a level of thankfulness even beyond that, right?
[00:42:04.020 --> 00:42:08.140]   Whenever you felt a level of thankfulness behind that, typically it is only when your
[00:42:08.140 --> 00:42:13.340]   savior has done for you what you know there was no other option.
[00:42:13.340 --> 00:42:15.980]   What you know you could not do and you did not deserve.
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:18.300]   What you know took incredible sacrifice.
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.420]   There is a kind of thankfulness that moves you to say, "I don't know how to thank you
[00:42:22.420 --> 00:42:25.900]   from words, from crying, from whatever it may be.
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:26.900]   You know what?
[00:42:26.900 --> 00:42:27.900]   I'm yours.
[00:42:27.900 --> 00:42:30.540]   You tell me what you need me to do, I'll do it."
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:33.380]   It's the kind of servanthood gratitude.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:37.500]   It is not a repayment of his gift to you.
[00:42:37.500 --> 00:42:44.820]   You're just so thankful and inspired, I feel like I just want to give to you.
[00:42:44.820 --> 00:42:46.620]   I'm yours.
[00:42:46.620 --> 00:42:49.540]   I'm at your disposal.
[00:42:49.540 --> 00:42:51.340]   Have you felt that?
[00:42:51.340 --> 00:42:54.180]   Have you felt that?
[00:42:54.180 --> 00:42:58.140]   Because the kind of gratitude that we're supposed to have is this incredible gratitude that
[00:42:58.140 --> 00:43:02.460]   is, yes, at some points and moments in our lives, maybe we think, "Oh, is this right?
[00:43:02.460 --> 00:43:05.700]   Is this kind of like the debtor's ethic?"
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:06.700]   And that is false.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.900]   It's just a fine line.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:13.980]   The debtor's ethic is false, okay, which says this, "Oh my goodness, I am such a wretched
[00:43:13.980 --> 00:43:14.980]   sinner.
[00:43:14.980 --> 00:43:17.220]   Oh my goodness, you had to die for me.
[00:43:17.220 --> 00:43:18.700]   I feel so bad.
[00:43:18.700 --> 00:43:21.420]   I wish it wasn't like this."
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:24.620]   And then God says to you, "What are you doing?
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:29.480]   Don't act like you could have done something to prevent Jesus from going to the cross,
[00:43:29.480 --> 00:43:31.300]   to make that not necessary."
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:32.980]   See that's the debtor's ethic.
[00:43:32.980 --> 00:43:37.740]   I have this incredible payment that you paid and I feel super bad for it and I wish there
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:40.540]   was a way to not burden you that much.
[00:43:40.540 --> 00:43:48.560]   And God Almighty will say, "Son, you had no other option but to put your burdens on Christ.
[00:43:48.560 --> 00:43:52.740]   You can't have a debtor's ethic.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:44:01.980]   What I'm talking about is the ethic of thanksgiving where you say, 'You've been so generous to
[00:44:01.980 --> 00:44:03.260]   me.
[00:44:03.260 --> 00:44:09.020]   I am both inspired, I'm vulnerable, I'm open to give back to you and whatever you want,
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:10.020]   it's yours.
[00:44:10.020 --> 00:44:11.020]   I'm all yours.'"
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:15.300]   That's the height of thanksgiving.
[00:44:15.300 --> 00:44:19.700]   Take a look at this passage in Psalm 116 verse 12.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:22.020]   Psalm 116 verse 12.
[00:44:22.020 --> 00:44:27.020]   The psalmist says, "What shall I render to the Lord for all of his benefits to me?
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:31.220]   I'll lift up the cup of salvation and call on the name of the Lord.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:34.300]   I'll pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of his people."
[00:44:34.300 --> 00:44:36.220]   I'm going to boast in the Lord.
[00:44:36.220 --> 00:44:38.740]   "Lord, I am your servant.
[00:44:38.740 --> 00:44:41.540]   Lord, I am your servant.
[00:44:41.540 --> 00:44:46.580]   You lose my bonds, I'll offer to you the sacrifice of thanksgiving and call on the name of the
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:47.580]   Lord.
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:51.600]   I'll pay my vows to the Lord in the presence of all his people, in the courts of the house
[00:44:51.600 --> 00:44:54.020]   of the Lord, in the midst of Jerusalem.
[00:44:54.020 --> 00:44:56.900]   Praise the Lord."
[00:44:56.900 --> 00:45:06.740]   My question to you, have we felt that gratitude that is so powerful it moves you to say, "God,
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.180]   I'm not trying to repay you because I know I can't.
[00:45:09.180 --> 00:45:15.220]   I'm not trying to make up for stuff because I can't make it up, but I am at your service
[00:45:15.220 --> 00:45:19.180]   because I'm so thankful.
[00:45:19.180 --> 00:45:21.940]   I owe you everything.
[00:45:21.940 --> 00:45:23.900]   You've given me everything.
[00:45:23.900 --> 00:45:30.460]   It doesn't matter if I'm here or there, in front of people or in private, I am yours."
[00:45:30.460 --> 00:45:37.040]   This is the kind of gratitude that I hope we will aspire to because this is the kind
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.460]   of transformed life that gives glory to God.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.380]   Let me repeat that.
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:47.740]   The kind of gratitude that moves you to freely give of yourself to the Lord, that's the kind
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:50.660]   of gratitude that glorifies God.
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:56.580]   There's a passage in 2 Corinthians 9 that says this, "You will be enriched in every
[00:45:56.580 --> 00:46:00.900]   way so that you can be generous on every occasion.
[00:46:00.900 --> 00:46:04.700]   And through us, your generosity result in thanksgiving to God.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:09.500]   This service that you perform is not only supplying the needs of the Lord's people,
[00:46:09.500 --> 00:46:15.180]   but is also overflowing in many expressions of thanks to God.
[00:46:15.180 --> 00:46:22.460]   Your generosity, your transformed life, because you received so much, it points to God and
[00:46:22.460 --> 00:46:26.140]   people thank and exalt the Lord."
[00:46:26.140 --> 00:46:31.940]   Another passage I want to show you, 2 Corinthians 4 verse 15, "For all things are for your sakes
[00:46:31.940 --> 00:46:37.580]   so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving of things
[00:46:37.580 --> 00:46:41.180]   to abound to the glory of God."
[00:46:41.180 --> 00:46:46.260]   Today we were talking about growing in the depth and breadth of our gratitude to the
[00:46:46.260 --> 00:46:47.260]   Lord.
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:53.700]   And I pray that we'll be inspired that no matter where you are currently, there has
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:56.720]   to be this growth.
[00:46:56.720 --> 00:47:01.340]   And as you do that, understand that as you are being filled, God has so designed it to
[00:47:01.340 --> 00:47:08.140]   transform you from being self-preserving, self-focused, self-attaining individuals to
[00:47:08.140 --> 00:47:11.940]   be people like Him.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:16.860]   Altogether powerful, altogether generous, altogether gracious.
[00:47:16.860 --> 00:47:27.620]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:31.260]   Our Lord, we want to give you thanks.
[00:47:31.260 --> 00:47:37.540]   God, we cannot even begin just to enumerate all the ways by which you have been merciful
[00:47:37.540 --> 00:47:39.740]   and loving towards us.
[00:47:39.740 --> 00:47:45.860]   But I pray, Lord, that although it's impossible for us to exhaustively do that, that God,
[00:47:45.860 --> 00:47:47.380]   that we would never grow tired.
[00:47:47.380 --> 00:47:50.540]   We would not grow weary of giving things to you.
[00:47:50.540 --> 00:47:53.180]   Lord, because you are deserving.
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:58.860]   Father God, you are so deserving that for eternity forward, people, your people, your
[00:47:58.860 --> 00:48:01.820]   hosts will sing praise to you.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.980]   And I pray, Father God, that you would continue then to inspire us by faith, to help us to
[00:48:05.980 --> 00:48:10.220]   see you, so that in every day, Lord, we would render to you our worship.
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:15.380]   Father God, thank you for your word that speaks to us to examine our hearts.
[00:48:15.380 --> 00:48:20.220]   I pray, Lord, that we would not sit on these things, but Lord, our expression would come
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:21.220]   forth.
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.620]   Father, I am yours.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:26.620]   Absolutely yours.
[00:48:26.620 --> 00:48:27.620]   We thank you.
[00:48:27.620 --> 00:48:28.620]   It's in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:28.620]   Amen.
[00:48:28.620 --> 00:48:29.460]   Amen.
