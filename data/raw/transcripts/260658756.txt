[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   All right, so I want to jump right in into the first section, Leviticus chapter 6 and
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:13.520]   7, but I want to give you a brief outline of what's happening here before we actually
[00:00:13.520 --> 00:00:15.400]   jump in.
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:20.560]   So in chapter 6 and 7, the main difference between what we've been studying up to this
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:25.880]   point is chapter 6 and 7 is under, remember we talked about the outline of the book of
[00:00:25.880 --> 00:00:26.880]   Leviticus?
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:28.020]   What do we call that outline?
[00:00:28.020 --> 00:00:35.640]   The format that is used starts with a C, chiastic, right?
[00:00:35.640 --> 00:00:37.480]   You guys all remember it, right?
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:38.480]   The chiastic.
[00:00:38.480 --> 00:00:50.920]   So chiastic outline, basically it starts with, remember?
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:52.320]   So how does a chiastic outline work?
[00:00:52.320 --> 00:00:57.400]   I should have put it up there, huh?
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:01:01.800]   Right, like that, exactly, that's exactly, if you look at it like, so you have the first
[00:01:01.800 --> 00:01:06.800]   point where it talks about the five major sacrifices, and remember the second point?
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:08.880]   Second section of it?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:14.840]   Which is where we are at now, 8, 9, and 10, talks about the priesthood, and then after
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:26.480]   that chapter 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, clean and unclean things, and then they have atonement
[00:01:26.480 --> 00:01:31.600]   by a student, okay, and then it works backwards from there, and then from chapter 16, you
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:35.920]   have 17 and on, talks about clean and unclean things, and then goes back to the priesthood,
[00:01:35.920 --> 00:01:39.420]   and then goes back to the sacrifices, so the outline is this way, right?
[00:01:39.420 --> 00:01:45.640]   So we're in the second part of the outline, chapter 8, 9, and 10, no sorry, 6 to 10, in
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.020]   the priesthood, so chapter 1 through 5 was talking about the sacrifices and the necessity
[00:01:51.020 --> 00:01:54.440]   of the worshippers, what they needed to do, right?
[00:01:54.440 --> 00:01:57.160]   What are the requirements when they bring it, what kind of animal do you need to bring
[00:01:57.160 --> 00:01:59.160]   for what sacrifices?
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.440]   Chapter 6 through 10 is about the rules and regulations given to the priesthood, right?
[00:02:05.440 --> 00:02:09.740]   So that's what we're looking at today in chapter 6 and 7, are the rules and regulations given
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:19.440]   to the priesthood, so the specific thing that we're looking at today, okay, is about the
[00:02:19.440 --> 00:02:21.960]   ritual meals.
[00:02:21.960 --> 00:02:27.320]   So along with each one of these sacrifices, the five sacrifices, that there is a meal,
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:33.520]   okay, obviously there's, in one of them, there isn't a meal, which we'll get to, but it is,
[00:02:33.520 --> 00:02:38.480]   after the sacrifice is given, there is a kind of a celebration, so the focus in these two
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:43.320]   chapters are the rules and regulations to the different kinds of animals that they are
[00:02:43.320 --> 00:02:47.540]   able to eat, not to eat, and where to eat, and that kind of stuff, right?
[00:02:47.540 --> 00:02:52.600]   So for each of these sacrifices are accompanied by instructions on who may eat, what, and
[00:02:52.600 --> 00:03:01.360]   where, so that's the outline of chapter 6 and 7, who may eat, what, and where, okay,
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:02.360]   exciting.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:09.840]   Again, as I told you, if you just study it as rules and regulation, it'll be like, you
[00:03:09.840 --> 00:03:14.540]   know, studying how to put furniture together that you don't understand, right?
[00:03:14.540 --> 00:03:18.200]   You have no intentions of doing, like looking at a roadmap that you're not interested in
[00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.480]   going, so it's not going to mean anything, so you always have to ask, like, why is this
[00:03:22.480 --> 00:03:24.400]   in here?
[00:03:24.400 --> 00:03:26.780]   How does this connect to the New Testament?
[00:03:26.780 --> 00:03:29.300]   How does this connect to what God is doing in the big picture?
[00:03:29.300 --> 00:03:32.760]   Because if you don't connect the dots, or if you don't make an effort to connect the
[00:03:32.760 --> 00:03:37.960]   dots, it's just going to sound like, don't eat this, don't touch this, don't go here,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:42.120]   you know, wear this clothing, don't wear that clothing, that's all it's going to sound like,
[00:03:42.120 --> 00:03:43.120]   right?
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:47.700]   And just as a reminder, when you start asking those questions and trying your best to connect
[00:03:47.700 --> 00:03:52.620]   the dots, some of them are going to be very clear to you, because the language you're
[00:03:52.620 --> 00:03:56.620]   going to find in the New Testament, so if you've ever studied through the book of Hebrews,
[00:03:56.620 --> 00:03:59.980]   if you've ever studied through any part of the New Testament, you're going to start seeing
[00:03:59.980 --> 00:04:04.740]   languages that you've already studied in the New Testament, and you're going to see that,
[00:04:04.740 --> 00:04:06.740]   oh, this is where it comes from.
[00:04:06.740 --> 00:04:09.980]   This is how the Jew would have understood that phrase, right?
[00:04:09.980 --> 00:04:12.240]   Some of it, you're not going to be able to connect the dots.
[00:04:12.240 --> 00:04:14.440]   Some of them are a little bit harder to connect the dots, right?
[00:04:14.440 --> 00:04:21.180]   But the effort to make the connect the dots is what makes the book of Leviticus so important,
[00:04:21.180 --> 00:04:22.500]   because they are all connected.
[00:04:22.500 --> 00:04:23.880]   There's nothing that's not connected.
[00:04:23.880 --> 00:04:29.380]   Some of them we know, some of them we're taking educated guess, but the more you understand
[00:04:29.380 --> 00:04:32.340]   the Bible, the more you're going to be able to connect these things, and once you connect
[00:04:32.340 --> 00:04:36.340]   these things, the gospel is just going to open up, right?
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:39.220]   You're not going to get a different gospel, you're going to get the same gospel, but it's
[00:04:39.220 --> 00:04:42.500]   going to make so much more sense, right?
[00:04:42.500 --> 00:04:46.740]   So this is about mainly the instructions about who, what, where, and how, and then verse
[00:04:46.740 --> 00:04:53.260]   1 and 5, chapters 1 and 5, general, it's instructions to general congregation.
[00:04:53.260 --> 00:04:57.300]   Chapter 6 and 7 focus on the priest's role in this worship.
[00:04:57.300 --> 00:05:02.180]   So majority of chapter 6 and 7 are instructions for the priests.
[00:05:02.180 --> 00:05:09.180]   Only chapter 7, 22, and 28 forward, it addresses the main congregation, okay?
[00:05:09.180 --> 00:05:14.260]   Like I said, in the larger picture of the outline, we're in the priesthood, chapter
[00:05:14.260 --> 00:05:17.700]   6, 7, 8, 9, and then 10, okay?
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:22.860]   And then chapter 11 is when we get into interesting stuff, like what animals are clean and unclean,
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.260]   you probably heard of before, but you had no idea why God did that, okay?
[00:05:27.260 --> 00:05:29.620]   So we'll jump into that when that happens.
[00:05:29.620 --> 00:05:33.140]   Okay, so this is the broad outline.
[00:05:33.140 --> 00:05:38.940]   So the instruction for eating the various sacrifices is given in three separate groups,
[00:05:38.940 --> 00:05:40.100]   okay?
[00:05:40.100 --> 00:05:44.300]   If you studied through it, chapter 6 and 7, some of you may have noticed it, okay?
[00:05:44.300 --> 00:05:49.180]   And I'm assuming some of you might have, and I'm assuming most of you probably did not,
[00:05:49.180 --> 00:05:50.180]   okay?
[00:05:50.180 --> 00:05:52.440]   But it falls into three major categories.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.940]   So that's going to be the broad outline of how we're going to understand chapter 6 and
[00:05:56.940 --> 00:05:58.260]   7, okay?
[00:05:58.260 --> 00:06:03.740]   So the three broad outline for the text is chapter 6, 8 through 13, which is the first
[00:06:03.740 --> 00:06:09.380]   part, it talks about the burnt offering where it is wholly consumed by God.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:16.020]   So the three outline, okay, three major outline is going to be first is only God can eat,
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.020]   right?
[00:06:17.020 --> 00:06:19.140]   That's the whole offering, right?
[00:06:19.140 --> 00:06:22.700]   And when we say eat, we're talking about symbolically.
[00:06:22.700 --> 00:06:27.140]   It's consumed by God, so the priest and the other people can't touch this.
[00:06:27.140 --> 00:06:28.260]   That's why it's called the whole offering.
[00:06:28.260 --> 00:06:34.700]   The second group has three offerings, which we'll get to later, that God consumes but
[00:06:34.700 --> 00:06:38.580]   also the priests eat, okay?
[00:06:38.580 --> 00:06:40.300]   So that's a second big category.
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:44.380]   And then the third big category, there's only one offering that falls into that category
[00:06:44.380 --> 00:06:48.180]   where God, the priest, and the worshiper also eats.
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:51.860]   Which offering was that?
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:52.860]   Peace offering, okay?
[00:06:53.180 --> 00:06:58.940]   There's only one offering where nothing is touched, nobody eats it, where one offering,
[00:06:58.940 --> 00:07:03.900]   everybody eats it, and then there's three offering where only God and the priest eat
[00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:04.900]   it, okay?
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:06.780]   You understand the outline?
[00:07:06.780 --> 00:07:09.500]   That's basically outline of chapter 6 and 7.
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   So the first one, the whole offering, one of the main things, again, some of these things
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.860]   are overlapping from what we learned in chapter 1 and 2, but the burnt offering was to be
[00:07:19.860 --> 00:07:23.300]   burnt around the clock.
[00:07:23.300 --> 00:07:26.580]   It was to be replaced, so the fire was never supposed to go out.
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:31.180]   This is mentioned five separate times.
[00:07:31.180 --> 00:07:36.000]   I only have three verses up there, it's because in two verses it's mentioned twice.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:41.340]   So five separate times, God emphasizes the fire shall not go out, it will not go out.
[00:07:41.340 --> 00:07:47.340]   It's going to be burning all the time, 24/7.
[00:07:47.340 --> 00:07:55.820]   And so we mentioned this when we first went through the burnt offering, that there was
[00:07:55.820 --> 00:08:00.300]   an aroma at the camp constantly because there was an animal being burnt.
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:05.580]   So remember, we talked about when God made the sacrifices, it wasn't enough that they
[00:08:05.580 --> 00:08:07.900]   gave the sacrifice and they were finished.
[00:08:07.900 --> 00:08:12.660]   He wanted them to see it, he wanted them to feel it, he wanted them to taste it, and he
[00:08:12.660 --> 00:08:14.700]   wanted them to smell it.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:19.380]   So all the senses of the worshiper was involved in the sacrifice.
[00:08:19.380 --> 00:08:22.780]   It wasn't just the mind, it wasn't just the heart, it wasn't just their strength, it was
[00:08:22.780 --> 00:08:24.700]   all of it.
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:31.060]   So the fact that this particular offering was being burned 24/7 meant that there was
[00:08:31.060 --> 00:08:38.000]   a smell of barbecue in the camp all the time, and God made sure that all the twelve tribes
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:40.740]   were equal distance from this tabernacle.
[00:08:40.740 --> 00:08:44.780]   And so if you were in the camp of Israel, you would have always thought there's something
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:48.780]   being burned, like this whole offering is being burned, whole offering is being burned,
[00:08:48.780 --> 00:08:54.580]   and it was going on 24/7.
[00:08:54.580 --> 00:09:00.220]   The fire itself, we're not there yet, but in chapter 9 it says God sends out fire, and
[00:09:00.220 --> 00:09:07.580]   then the first fire that's lit on the altar, God lights it himself.
[00:09:07.580 --> 00:09:10.380]   God himself lights the fire.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:15.740]   And so some people have interpreted this fire not going out, going 24/7, was that whatever
[00:09:15.740 --> 00:09:22.220]   was being sacrificed, God, who came in the form of fire, was, he himself was consuming
[00:09:22.220 --> 00:09:24.020]   this.
[00:09:24.020 --> 00:09:26.420]   So this was a sacrifice given to God.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:31.420]   So that was, again, this is just an educated guess, but some people speculated that that's
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:36.340]   why they wanted this fire to never go out, because what God lit, he wanted it to be kept
[00:09:36.340 --> 00:09:43.060]   lit, symbolizing that God himself in the form of fire was in their presence.
[00:09:43.060 --> 00:09:50.980]   Do you remember what this burnt offering represented?
[00:09:50.980 --> 00:09:54.780]   What's something that you remember from the study of the burnt offering?
[00:09:54.780 --> 00:09:55.780]   About this offering.
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:58.620]   It's a whole offering, so you don't touch any of it.
[00:09:58.620 --> 00:10:00.820]   Everything had to be consumed on the fire.
[00:10:00.820 --> 00:10:05.140]   That's why we call it whole offering, or burnt offering, because all of it was burnt.
[00:10:05.140 --> 00:10:09.460]   But what was the significance of this offering?
[00:10:09.460 --> 00:10:11.940]   It was the main atonement, right?
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:16.180]   It was the main atonement, so a lot of the other sacrifices, the peace offering, the
[00:10:16.180 --> 00:10:22.220]   grain offering, had to be given after this sacrifice, because until your sins are atoned
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:24.780]   for, the other sacrifices you couldn't give.
[00:10:24.780 --> 00:10:28.420]   That's why this offering had to be given constantly.
[00:10:28.420 --> 00:10:34.460]   So it was the most important of the sacrifices, it was the most frequent of the sacrifices,
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:37.340]   and it was completely unilateral.
[00:10:37.340 --> 00:10:40.060]   This was mandated, and it was mandated all the time.
[00:10:40.060 --> 00:10:46.180]   So it symbolized the need for atonement for the people of God to be constant in order
[00:10:46.180 --> 00:10:48.940]   for a holy God to be in their presence.
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:52.060]   You following?
[00:10:52.060 --> 00:10:57.460]   So the whole point of this tabernacle is for a holy God to dwell among sinful people, and
[00:10:57.460 --> 00:11:02.300]   the only way he could do that is if the sins of the people were constantly covered by the
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.780]   blood of these animals.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:08.060]   And this burnt offering, whole offering, symbolized that.
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:10.540]   So remember what we said?
[00:11:10.540 --> 00:11:18.340]   In these offerings, what does this particular offering kind of point to in the New Testament?
[00:11:18.340 --> 00:11:25.220]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:11:25.220 --> 00:11:26.800]   Justification, right?
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:31.140]   That our sins are completely justified, we're not transforming a part of our lives, we're
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:35.860]   not transforming, you know, like I have a bad tongue or there are certain parts of my
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:37.020]   life that I need to fix.
[00:11:37.020 --> 00:11:42.460]   He said this whole offering basically teaches that all of it, right, that we are dead in
[00:11:42.460 --> 00:11:44.360]   our trespasses, completely.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:48.740]   So we're not just being redeemed in tongue, we're not just redeeming our youth, but our
[00:11:48.740 --> 00:11:50.300]   whole life, right?
[00:11:50.300 --> 00:11:57.500]   So this requires a complete repentance.
[00:11:57.500 --> 00:11:58.980]   And what was it?
[00:11:58.980 --> 00:12:05.020]   And it also symbolized a continual need for sanctification to be in the presence of God.
[00:12:05.020 --> 00:12:09.980]   So just a few verses as it points to the New Testament.
[00:12:09.980 --> 00:12:15.300]   Remember 1 Thessalonians 5, 19 is "Do not quench the Spirit."
[00:12:15.300 --> 00:12:18.660]   So remember when the Holy Spirit comes, the third person of the Holy Spirit comes, he
[00:12:18.660 --> 00:12:20.700]   comes as what?
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:24.100]   Like fire in a new covenant.
[00:12:24.100 --> 00:12:28.940]   Hebrews 12, 28, 29, "Therefore let us be grateful for receiving a kingdom that cannot be shaken,
[00:12:28.940 --> 00:12:33.980]   and thus let us offer to God acceptable worship with reverence and awe, for our God is a consuming
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:34.980]   fire."
[00:12:34.980 --> 00:12:40.700]   So when we think of the word "consuming fire," we think of bonfire, we think of houses that
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:45.060]   we've seen burned down, maybe we've seen, you know, forests being burned down in fire.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:50.220]   But when a Jew heard "consuming fire," what do you think he thought of?
[00:12:50.220 --> 00:12:52.140]   Probably sacrifices, right?
[00:12:52.140 --> 00:12:57.500]   So when he says "our God is a consuming fire," immediately they probably thought of the year
[00:12:57.500 --> 00:13:02.980]   after year, decade after decade, this consuming fire that was constantly lit.
[00:13:02.980 --> 00:13:08.780]   Hebrews 7, 25, "Consequently, he is able to save to the uttermost those who draw near
[00:13:08.780 --> 00:13:12.500]   to God through him, since he always lives to make intercession for them."
[00:13:12.500 --> 00:13:19.300]   So again, this sacrifice and this constant need for burning the sacrifice, and that Christ,
[00:13:19.300 --> 00:13:24.900]   who is our sacrificial lamb, is interceding on our behalf constantly.
[00:13:24.900 --> 00:13:25.900]   Right?
[00:13:25.900 --> 00:13:26.900]   Comprende?
[00:13:26.900 --> 00:13:29.900]   Okay, get it?
[00:13:29.900 --> 00:13:32.900]   All right.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:34.700]   Okay.
[00:13:34.700 --> 00:13:40.220]   So in this sacrifice, there's one thing that he does say, is the priest was to wear appropriate
[00:13:40.220 --> 00:13:44.500]   clothing to cover himself for the sanctuary, but to change it into another garment to carry
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:46.340]   the ash outside the camp each morning.
[00:13:46.340 --> 00:13:51.700]   So because there is a fire being burned all the time, there's obviously going to be constant
[00:13:51.700 --> 00:13:53.940]   need to take care of the ash.
[00:13:53.940 --> 00:13:59.340]   So in order to do that, God said that every morning they would gather up the ashes, and
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.680]   then they would have to take it out of the camp.
[00:14:01.680 --> 00:14:04.140]   But he gave specific instruction.
[00:14:04.140 --> 00:14:08.220]   What you wear in the camp, in the tabernacle, and what you wear outside the tabernacle has
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:09.820]   to be different.
[00:14:09.820 --> 00:14:10.820]   Right?
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:17.820]   And signifying that there's a clear line between clean and unclean.
[00:14:17.820 --> 00:14:20.300]   There's a clear line between clean and unclean.
[00:14:20.300 --> 00:14:29.300]   So all of this was done to teach a particular lesson or to point to something that's coming.
[00:14:29.300 --> 00:14:35.600]   And he didn't want anything that they did to be confused with just what was going on
[00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:36.700]   just everyday life.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:40.060]   So everything that was happening inside the tabernacle, everything that was related to
[00:14:40.060 --> 00:14:46.060]   the sacrifices, was considered holy, even what the priest wore.
[00:14:46.060 --> 00:14:47.420]   Right?
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:52.060]   And so it was instructed that when he was handling it inside as a part of the ritual,
[00:14:52.060 --> 00:14:53.460]   he would wear one clothing.
[00:14:53.460 --> 00:14:56.260]   When he went out, he would wear another clothing for that purpose.
[00:14:56.260 --> 00:14:59.060]   Again, to distinguish the holy and the common things.
[00:14:59.060 --> 00:15:01.860]   So this is extremely important.
[00:15:01.860 --> 00:15:04.180]   The distinguishing between holy and common.
[00:15:04.180 --> 00:15:05.180]   Holy and common.
[00:15:05.180 --> 00:15:09.340]   Because you're going to see this theme over and over and over and all throughout the book
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.100]   of Leviticus.
[00:15:12.100 --> 00:15:14.900]   One animal is considered holy, the other one is unclean.
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:15.900]   Right?
[00:15:15.900 --> 00:15:21.900]   This particular pole when it's sanctified, it is holy, but before it is, it is common.
[00:15:21.900 --> 00:15:26.100]   Certain people who are separated and anointed are considered holy, and then the people who
[00:15:26.100 --> 00:15:27.640]   are not are considered common.
[00:15:27.640 --> 00:15:32.600]   So all throughout the book of Leviticus, God makes a very distinct line between clean and
[00:15:32.600 --> 00:15:33.600]   unclean.
[00:15:33.600 --> 00:15:34.600]   Okay?
[00:15:34.600 --> 00:15:38.740]   And so, again, you're going to see this phrase over and over, holy and common.
[00:15:38.740 --> 00:15:39.740]   Holy and common.
[00:15:39.740 --> 00:15:40.740]   Or holy and unclean.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:41.740]   Okay?
[00:15:41.740 --> 00:15:54.780]   The second group, the second group of three offerings consumed by God and the priests,
[00:15:54.780 --> 00:16:05.660]   and the three offerings were the grain offering, sin offering, and guilt offering.
[00:16:05.660 --> 00:16:10.660]   Do you notice the difference in order of the five offerings in the chapter one through
[00:16:10.660 --> 00:16:14.380]   five in the offerings that are mentioned here?
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:21.700]   Let's see who has a good memory.
[00:16:21.700 --> 00:16:22.700]   You notice the order?
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:28.340]   Do you remember the order of the offerings, the five offerings?
[00:16:28.340 --> 00:16:36.700]   Burnt offering was number one.
[00:16:36.700 --> 00:16:41.860]   Grain offering was number two, which was the third offering?
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:42.860]   Peace offering.
[00:16:42.860 --> 00:16:46.340]   We're at 100% today.
[00:16:46.340 --> 00:16:48.680]   Peace offering was the third offering, right?
[00:16:48.680 --> 00:16:52.100]   And then the sin offering, and then the guilt offering.
[00:16:52.100 --> 00:16:58.460]   In this order, it's not in that burnt offering is first, but then you have the grain offering,
[00:16:58.460 --> 00:17:02.160]   sin offering, and guilt offering, and then the peace offering is at the very end.
[00:17:02.160 --> 00:17:03.700]   And there's a reason for that.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.340]   Again, that's not random.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:08.980]   And we'll try to point that out later.
[00:17:08.980 --> 00:17:10.860]   So clearly there is a pattern.
[00:17:10.860 --> 00:17:14.660]   There's God only, God and the priest, and God, priest, and everybody else.
[00:17:14.660 --> 00:17:15.660]   So it's in that order.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:20.700]   So the peace offering, obviously, it goes to the end for that reason.
[00:17:20.700 --> 00:17:23.860]   In these three offerings, if you remember, the grain offering was given as a form of
[00:17:23.860 --> 00:17:26.260]   tribute to acknowledge God's lordship over them.
[00:17:26.260 --> 00:17:30.720]   So remember, this was where they would give the tithe, right?
[00:17:30.720 --> 00:17:35.060]   They would give thanks offering to this, but again, it symbolized tribute to God.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:38.340]   It was recognizing his lordship over their life.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:41.860]   That was the grain offering, right?
[00:17:41.860 --> 00:17:45.940]   The sin offering was inadvertent sin, okay?
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:50.380]   Again, remember we talked about inadvertent sin would be sin that you're not aware of,
[00:17:50.380 --> 00:17:55.280]   but sin that once you became aware of it, you were genuinely repentant.
[00:17:55.280 --> 00:18:00.340]   And so what was a sin that was not forgivable?
[00:18:00.340 --> 00:18:04.000]   It was willful sin, right?
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:07.580]   You knew exactly what you were doing and you willfully went against God.
[00:18:07.580 --> 00:18:13.420]   So remember we talked about how it talks about murder deserved capital punishment, but so
[00:18:13.420 --> 00:18:15.900]   did breaking of the Sabbath.
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.780]   And we thought, well, breaking of the Sabbath, you're equating that with murder.
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:24.940]   But when you look at the very first sin, they ate the tree of life, right?
[00:18:24.940 --> 00:18:27.580]   And you say, well, that required that.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:31.200]   It's because there was a willful rebellion against God.
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.760]   And breaking of the Sabbath was a willful rebellion against God, right?
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:37.980]   So we don't view sin from our perspective.
[00:18:37.980 --> 00:18:39.420]   We view sin from God's perspective.
[00:18:39.420 --> 00:18:43.660]   And the greatest sin from God's perspective is a willful rebellion against him because
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:50.280]   ultimately, even if you didn't commit murder, it leads to death one way or the other, right?
[00:18:50.280 --> 00:18:52.140]   So that was the sin offering.
[00:18:52.140 --> 00:18:55.420]   The guilt offering, if you remember, was very similar.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:18:59.460]   In fact, a lot of the requirements for the sin offering was the same as guilt offering,
[00:18:59.460 --> 00:19:02.620]   but the emphasis on the guilt offering was to what?
[00:19:02.620 --> 00:19:04.380]   Reparation, right?
[00:19:04.380 --> 00:19:10.540]   If you damage someone else's property or you made a sacrifice that they gave and you, for
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:15.140]   some reason you damaged it, you had to pay that offering and how much more?
[00:19:15.140 --> 00:19:17.740]   What percent?
[00:19:17.740 --> 00:19:20.460]   20%, right?
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:22.900]   You have to pay back 20%.
[00:19:22.900 --> 00:19:26.380]   You have to restore what you damaged plus 20%.
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:31.380]   So the guilt offering basically added on top of that to make things right.
[00:19:31.380 --> 00:19:32.860]   You don't just say, "Hey, I'm sorry.
[00:19:32.860 --> 00:19:33.860]   We're forgiven," and that's it.
[00:19:33.860 --> 00:19:37.540]   He said, "No, you need to pay for whatever damage that you committed."
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:43.460]   And so remember, what did the 20% represent in the Jewish community at that time?
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:44.460]   The interest.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.620]   So if somebody loaned the money, typically they would charge a 20% interest on whatever
[00:19:49.620 --> 00:19:50.620]   they gave.
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:57.900]   So 20% to give back basically meant that when you repented, the other person wouldn't lose
[00:19:57.900 --> 00:19:58.900]   anything.
[00:19:58.900 --> 00:20:02.220]   If he rented it or loaned it to somebody, he would get 20% back.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.660]   So that's how you would pay them back.
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:10.380]   Remember, that was the guilt offering.
[00:20:10.380 --> 00:20:17.460]   So the offering was to be consumed by the priest only in the designated holy place.
[00:20:17.460 --> 00:20:24.580]   So these three offerings, God consumes it, but after the parts that are sacrificed are
[00:20:24.580 --> 00:20:28.980]   consumed, they would take the other parts and God gave them very specific orders of
[00:20:28.980 --> 00:20:34.660]   what they are able to eat and on top of that, where they're supposed to eat.
[00:20:34.660 --> 00:20:37.820]   It doesn't say here, but it also means that they had to wear a certain clothing while
[00:20:37.820 --> 00:20:38.820]   they were in the tabernacle.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:46.380]   So what, where, and how was very specific with this offering.
[00:20:46.380 --> 00:20:57.500]   Now why do you think it was important where they ate?
[00:20:57.500 --> 00:20:58.500]   It doesn't say.
[00:20:58.500 --> 00:21:00.380]   This is just, there's no right answer.
[00:21:00.380 --> 00:21:07.140]   I'm just asking you because I'm trying to figure this out myself.
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.260]   I'm just asking you because I want you to ask these questions as you guys are studying.
[00:21:12.260 --> 00:21:13.260]   This is my guess.
[00:21:13.260 --> 00:21:15.900]   I'm not saying that this is because it doesn't say that this is the reason.
[00:21:15.900 --> 00:21:21.900]   My guess is eating is something that you do commonly every single day.
[00:21:21.900 --> 00:21:25.420]   You can have a beef jerky in your pocket and just eat it whenever you want.
[00:21:25.420 --> 00:21:32.660]   So this had to be done for the purpose of not feeding the priest.
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:35.940]   The purpose of this wasn't, "Oh, the hungry priest, we're going to take care of you so
[00:21:35.940 --> 00:21:39.420]   when these sacrifices come, then you make sure you eat all of this."
[00:21:39.420 --> 00:21:44.540]   That was not the ultimate goal, even though it did serve that purpose.
[00:21:44.540 --> 00:21:47.300]   It was a part of the ritual.
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:52.220]   The point of it was that it needed to be participating in the part of the ritual that pointed to
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:54.660]   something clearly.
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:22:00.100]   So that if the priest started to carry this around, put it in their pocket, and started
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:05.580]   chewing it wherever they want, my guess is it would have started to feel like something
[00:22:05.580 --> 00:22:06.940]   common, not part of the ritual.
[00:22:06.940 --> 00:22:12.740]   So I think God made them do that, gave them specific requirements in order to make sure
[00:22:12.740 --> 00:22:16.780]   that this was part of the ritual, that this was not just something that they did breakfast,
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:19.220]   lunch, and dinner.
[00:22:19.220 --> 00:22:21.740]   Again, this is not the law.
[00:22:21.740 --> 00:22:25.380]   This is Peter Kim's guess.
[00:22:25.380 --> 00:22:31.940]   That's my guess.
[00:22:31.940 --> 00:22:36.100]   The exception to this was grain offering offered by priest for their anointing or dedication
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:39.100]   to service must be completely burned and uneaten.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:46.100]   So within this grain offering, there is a grain offering that, remember we said that
[00:22:46.100 --> 00:22:49.080]   part of the grain offering was a vow, a dedication.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:54.140]   So when this dedication took place specifically for the priest, in that situation, none of
[00:22:54.140 --> 00:22:56.100]   it was to be touched.
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:23:00.700]   That all of it was to be burned up.
[00:23:00.700 --> 00:23:05.100]   Because part of the anointing required for them to be completely set apart.
[00:23:05.100 --> 00:23:08.300]   So again, think about the meaning behind this.
[00:23:08.300 --> 00:23:12.900]   The whole offering, the atonement, there's nothing salvage, only God.
[00:23:12.900 --> 00:23:15.020]   It's completely unilateral.
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:21.500]   These three offerings are given to God, but a portion of it is eaten by the priest, other
[00:23:21.500 --> 00:23:25.820]   than when there is an anointing, ordination taking place.
[00:23:25.820 --> 00:23:28.860]   In that ordination, it's kind of treated like a whole offering.
[00:23:28.860 --> 00:23:30.780]   You just leave it.
[00:23:30.780 --> 00:23:37.940]   So if the burnt offering was justification, these three offerings, and I'm not saying
[00:23:37.940 --> 00:23:42.900]   that it is, but there are some things that sound familiar.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:47.500]   What will we kind of equate it to in the New Testament?
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:48.500]   Sanctification.
[00:23:48.500 --> 00:23:54.020]   So it doesn't mean like, justification God did, sanctification we do.
[00:23:54.020 --> 00:23:55.740]   Not saying that at all.
[00:23:55.740 --> 00:23:59.780]   But what it is pointing to is the whole offering was completely 100% unilateral.
[00:23:59.780 --> 00:24:03.220]   He initiates it, nothing is touched, he does it.
[00:24:03.220 --> 00:24:10.220]   Sanctification is God is working in us, but we are also participants.
[00:24:10.220 --> 00:24:13.860]   Even though the Holy Spirit is working in us and pushing us to walk by the Spirit, to
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:20.100]   live by the Spirit, but at the same time, it's unlike the burnt offering where it's
[00:24:20.100 --> 00:24:25.620]   completely unilateral.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:41.420]   All three offerings are called most holy.
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:45.180]   And this is emphasized in this particular offering.
[00:24:45.180 --> 00:24:47.620]   Does that mean the burnt offering is not holy?
[00:24:47.620 --> 00:24:49.740]   Obviously, they're all holy.
[00:24:49.740 --> 00:24:51.780]   The peace offering, they're all holy.
[00:24:51.780 --> 00:24:57.140]   But for some reason, these three particular offerings, three separate times it says it
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.340]   will be considered most holy.
[00:24:58.340 --> 00:24:59.340]   It will be considered most holy.
[00:24:59.340 --> 00:25:01.620]   It is considered most holy.
[00:25:01.620 --> 00:25:06.660]   So he's trying to get the attention of the priests and the Israelites that these things
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:13.500]   ought to be seen with a reverent view.
[00:25:13.500 --> 00:25:16.900]   You shouldn't just handle this in any way.
[00:25:16.900 --> 00:25:19.020]   What is the reason for that?
[00:25:19.020 --> 00:25:21.740]   The word holy literally means to be set apart.
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:27.540]   It has two specific applications.
[00:25:27.540 --> 00:25:31.780]   The first is the morally innocent part.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:38.380]   When God dies for us and we are made holy, we stand before God and we are declared holy.
[00:25:38.380 --> 00:25:44.060]   So when he says we're declared holy, it means God sees us as innocent, morally innocent.
[00:25:44.060 --> 00:25:47.280]   So whatever sins that we committed before God, we are innocent now because blood of
[00:25:47.280 --> 00:25:48.280]   Christ covers us.
[00:25:48.280 --> 00:25:53.220]   So when we think of holy, we typically think of that.
[00:25:53.220 --> 00:25:55.260]   But the word holy means more than that.
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:26:00.580]   The broader understanding of the term literally just means to be set apart.
[00:26:00.580 --> 00:26:05.300]   But specifically set apart for God's use.
[00:26:05.300 --> 00:26:09.060]   So a particular article could be holy.
[00:26:09.060 --> 00:26:10.940]   An animal could be holy.
[00:26:10.940 --> 00:26:12.300]   A cloth could be holy.
[00:26:12.300 --> 00:26:14.340]   A certain day could be holy.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.500]   The temple could be holy.
[00:26:15.500 --> 00:26:16.500]   The land could be holy.
[00:26:16.500 --> 00:26:18.580]   The nation could be holy.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.340]   So obviously when we're talking about these articles, we're not talking about morally
[00:26:22.340 --> 00:26:25.080]   perfect.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:31.300]   It simply means that it's been set apart for God's use.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:37.660]   Now the reason why this understanding is important is because in the next section, it says anyone
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:45.120]   or anything that touches these offerings dedicated to the Lord became holy.
[00:26:45.120 --> 00:26:48.240]   And so we might think, "Oh, they became holy?
[00:26:48.240 --> 00:26:49.960]   How did they become holy?
[00:26:49.960 --> 00:26:52.140]   They became morally holy because they touched something?"
[00:26:52.140 --> 00:26:56.860]   And you know the significance of this, right?
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:01.500]   Significance of this is that when you touch an article that belonged to God, you said
[00:27:01.500 --> 00:27:03.820]   the one who touched it became holy.
[00:27:03.820 --> 00:27:07.340]   Now that doesn't mean like you're forgiven your sins or atoned for.
[00:27:07.340 --> 00:27:10.100]   That's not the meaning of this, right?
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:17.760]   Because you came into contact with something that became holy, in a sense, you became defiled.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:18.760]   In a sense.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:20.620]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:22.280]   Because you weren't meant to be holy.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:27.320]   You became holy because you came into contact with something that you weren't supposed to be.
[00:27:27.320 --> 00:27:29.200]   Right?
[00:27:29.200 --> 00:27:34.040]   So as a result, the person had to go through ritual cleansing.
[00:27:34.040 --> 00:27:38.520]   So it's not like you went there and then these animals who are considered sacred, you touch
[00:27:38.520 --> 00:27:43.280]   this and I'm holy now, I don't need to give burnt offering.
[00:27:43.280 --> 00:27:45.440]   I became holy because I touched these articles.
[00:27:45.440 --> 00:27:48.740]   That's not the meaning behind this.
[00:27:48.740 --> 00:27:54.760]   So in a sense, when you understand what the term means, in essence, it may be a little
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:02.400]   bit confusing because of the term, but in essence, you become defiled by touching that.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:07.920]   Maybe the word defiled is not the right word to use, but that's the best way to understand it.
[00:28:07.920 --> 00:28:10.120]   Right?
[00:28:10.120 --> 00:28:15.800]   Because if you don't cleanse yourself, if you don't repent of it, you can be cut off.
[00:28:15.800 --> 00:28:16.800]   There's judgment.
[00:28:16.800 --> 00:28:21.400]   So it's not like, "Oh, I became holy, so everybody wants to be holy, so we're good."
[00:28:21.400 --> 00:28:23.840]   That's not the meaning behind it.
[00:28:23.840 --> 00:28:28.200]   The context is you touch something that was sacred that you shouldn't have touched.
[00:28:28.200 --> 00:28:29.200]   Right?
[00:28:29.200 --> 00:28:30.200]   All right.
[00:28:30.200 --> 00:28:43.680]   And even with the clothing, when the blood spilled over something else, they had to either
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:49.720]   be washed or had to be destroyed.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:57.120]   Now let me talk about the significance of this.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:00.040]   Let me say one more thing before we move on.
[00:29:00.040 --> 00:29:04.000]   The guilt offering, so we talked about the grain offering, sin offering, but the guilt
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:05.200]   offering, not much is said.
[00:29:05.200 --> 00:29:12.800]   All it says is the law is the same of the sin offering, and then it doesn't explain much.
[00:29:12.800 --> 00:29:16.720]   In the first five chapters, in chapter five, when it talks about the guilt offering, it
[00:29:16.720 --> 00:29:22.880]   also only gives you a small portion, as far as the content.
[00:29:22.880 --> 00:29:28.400]   So the sin offering and guilt offering is very similar, other than the fact that the
[00:29:28.400 --> 00:29:32.200]   guilt offering required a reparation, that you need to pay back whatever damage that
[00:29:32.200 --> 00:29:33.200]   you did.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:34.200]   Right?
[00:29:34.200 --> 00:29:35.200]   No, okay.
[00:29:35.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   So having said that, the right understanding of what he is saying here, again, we see it
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:42.720]   in application in the New Testament.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:51.200]   Turn your Bibles to 1 Corinthians 7.14.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:30:00.880]   First Corinthians 7.14.
[00:30:00.880 --> 00:30:11.520]   Somebody read that passage out loud for us.
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:16.400]   If you feel like you're tired and you're about to fall asleep, you should be the one reading.
[00:30:16.400 --> 00:30:17.960]   It'll help you wake up.
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:18.960]   Okay?
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:23.240]   Now you're not going to read, now you're going to...
[00:30:23.240 --> 00:30:33.600]   He was wide awake, by the way, so...
[00:30:33.600 --> 00:30:35.980]   Okay.
[00:30:35.980 --> 00:30:44.400]   So in that context, what happens to the husband because of the believing wife?
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:46.160]   He becomes holy, it says.
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:47.160]   Right?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:48.440]   You read that, right?
[00:30:48.440 --> 00:30:53.200]   So does that mean that if you are married to a believer, that your unbelieving husband
[00:30:53.200 --> 00:30:56.260]   is saved?
[00:30:56.260 --> 00:30:57.260]   Of course not, right?
[00:30:57.260 --> 00:30:58.680]   That would be heresy.
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:00.840]   That's not what that means.
[00:31:00.840 --> 00:31:03.600]   But that's the language that he uses.
[00:31:03.600 --> 00:31:08.000]   So where do you think that idea, that language comes from?
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.640]   Probably understanding, because these five major sacrifices was embedded into the culture.
[00:31:14.640 --> 00:31:20.640]   It's kind of like Koreans and kimchi, it's just assumed, right?
[00:31:20.640 --> 00:31:23.120]   It's just a certain part of the culture, it's just embedded in you.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:25.560]   You don't have to talk about it, everybody just assumes it.
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:30.980]   These Jews, these sacrifices, their whole culture is based upon these sacrifices.
[00:31:30.980 --> 00:31:36.320]   So the language that they use in the New Testament, so much of it comes from what was embedded
[00:31:36.320 --> 00:31:37.680]   into their culture.
[00:31:37.680 --> 00:31:39.600]   So what does he mean by that?
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:44.960]   When he says that because you're married to a believer, that the husband becomes holy,
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:50.680]   he's not saying he's morally holy, he's not saying that he's saved, he's saying that because
[00:31:50.680 --> 00:31:58.600]   she has been set apart, and because she is linked to him, the things that benefit her,
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:01.560]   she will benefit, he will somehow benefit.
[00:32:01.560 --> 00:32:08.040]   Meaning that her presence in the life of the unbeliever, that there is a residual effect
[00:32:08.040 --> 00:32:10.840]   on her, not salvation-wise, right?
[00:32:10.840 --> 00:32:15.200]   Because you have somebody who is going to preach the gospel in your home.
[00:32:15.200 --> 00:32:20.380]   You have somebody who's going to be an aroma of Christ in your bed, right?
[00:32:20.380 --> 00:32:24.480]   Where you're making decisions together, you're living together, it doesn't mean he's saved.
[00:32:24.480 --> 00:32:29.720]   So there the word for holy or for sanctified is not talking about salvation, it's not talking
[00:32:29.720 --> 00:32:34.080]   about morally, it's talking about because she has been set apart, whatever comes in
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.120]   contact with her also becomes holy, right?
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:43.120]   So that idea comes from here, right?
[00:32:43.120 --> 00:32:46.600]   And I know there's some confusion, you guys are looking at me like, "What is he talking
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:47.600]   about?"
[00:32:47.600 --> 00:32:52.640]   I'm just going to move on anyway, alright?
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:56.560]   But I want you to think about, I want you to understand that that term holy here is
[00:32:56.560 --> 00:33:00.760]   not referring to salvation, it's not talking about morally holy, but something that's been
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:01.760]   set apart.
[00:33:01.760 --> 00:33:04.120]   So just keep that in mind, okay?
[00:33:04.120 --> 00:33:13.320]   We're going to come back and address this issue in another chapter.
[00:33:13.320 --> 00:33:22.240]   So the third group has one offering, the peace offering.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:28.640]   And it was shared by God, priests, and the people.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:33.400]   This is the only offering where the congregants were allowed to eat, right?
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:36.480]   Everything else they gave the offering and then they went home.
[00:33:36.480 --> 00:33:40.960]   They actually end up having a picnic.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:46.360]   If the offering was given as a Thanksgiving offering, they are to be eaten on the same
[00:33:46.360 --> 00:33:52.120]   day and not leave any of it until the morning.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:57.480]   So it was supposed to be celebrated, it was not meant to be extended.
[00:33:57.480 --> 00:34:00.760]   The offering is given that day and then it's finished, right?
[00:34:00.760 --> 00:34:02.960]   And you're not supposed to touch it beyond that.
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:08.280]   If it is a vow offering or a free will offering, they were to eat it the same day and then
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:15.360]   whatever is not eaten the same day, you can eat it the second day, but not the third day.
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:16.720]   So up to two days.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:22.400]   So these two particular offerings, the vow offering and the free will offering, where
[00:34:22.400 --> 00:34:32.400]   the sacrifice and the elements of the sacrifice can be extended up to two days.
[00:34:32.400 --> 00:34:34.920]   So it was meant to be a celebration.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.200]   Where Thanksgiving was supposed to be given an offering, you eat it and go home.
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.800]   Whereas a vow offering or a free will offering, it can be extended up to two days.
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:48.920]   It's not required that you eat it in two days, but you can eat it for two days, which would
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:52.040]   extend the celebration.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:53.680]   So the picnic wasn't just one day.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:35:01.240]   So as an example, certain things that are celebrated a big deal, I don't know if we
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:06.560]   hear, the big holidays tend to take more than one day, right?
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:11.440]   Even though Thanksgiving is only one day, you get many days, right?
[00:35:11.440 --> 00:35:13.760]   So it's kind of like that.
[00:35:13.760 --> 00:35:18.160]   If it was given for this purpose, it was God gave an allotment for it to be celebrated
[00:35:18.160 --> 00:35:20.520]   for more than one day.
[00:35:20.520 --> 00:35:26.040]   For Thanksgiving was just one day, but not to go beyond third day.
[00:35:26.040 --> 00:35:31.560]   But even the people, the fat of the animals, right?
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:36.760]   I didn't go over that.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.600]   The people who are to partake of the offering must also be ritually cleansed, or they will
[00:35:40.600 --> 00:35:43.480]   be guilty of sin and cut off from the people.
[00:35:43.480 --> 00:35:49.680]   What does it mean to be cut off from the people?
[00:35:49.680 --> 00:35:52.040]   Cut off from the people could mean two things.
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:57.400]   One, you're basically outcasted from the city, right?
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.480]   You can't participate with the people.
[00:35:59.480 --> 00:36:02.080]   Or what's the other option?
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:03.960]   Capital punishment, right?
[00:36:03.960 --> 00:36:06.340]   You can die from it.
[00:36:06.340 --> 00:36:09.640]   So it was a serious offense, very serious offense.
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.580]   Even as they were celebrating, they said you have to go through cleansing.
[00:36:12.580 --> 00:36:19.260]   You cannot be in the presence of God for any reason without having your sins atoned for.
[00:36:19.260 --> 00:36:21.000]   You have to go through the cleansing.
[00:36:21.000 --> 00:36:23.080]   And that was, so think about that.
[00:36:23.080 --> 00:36:29.340]   This was a constant teaching in the nation of Israel, constant, right?
[00:36:29.340 --> 00:36:35.120]   Even as they are celebrating, they are being taught that you have to be cleansed.
[00:36:35.120 --> 00:36:40.160]   And the consequence of that is not that you have to do it over.
[00:36:40.160 --> 00:36:42.880]   It's not that, no, you blew it Tuesday, you come back Wednesday.
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:48.560]   It's the consequence of that was you get castigated from where you are, which means you probably
[00:36:48.560 --> 00:36:50.880]   couldn't live, or there was capital punishment.
[00:36:50.880 --> 00:36:53.040]   It was a serious, serious offense.
[00:36:53.040 --> 00:37:00.120]   So nobody came to the tabernacle willy-nilly, nobody.
[00:37:00.120 --> 00:37:02.920]   You wouldn't, would you?
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:08.560]   In fact, we're not there yet, but I'm sure you already know what happens in chapter 10.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.880]   After he gives all the requirements, all the regulations, the first guy who offers a sacrifice,
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:17.080]   first two guys who offer the sacrifice, they don't do it properly.
[00:37:17.080 --> 00:37:18.400]   It's not like they worshiped idols.
[00:37:18.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   I mean, we'll go into the detail of what happens, but exactly like God said, they died as a
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:28.280]   result of it.
[00:37:28.280 --> 00:37:33.080]   So this tabernacle was not very inviting.
[00:37:33.080 --> 00:37:36.920]   So I think a few of you asked, right?
[00:37:36.920 --> 00:37:41.760]   Some of you asked me privately, and then I think somebody asked in the group last time,
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:45.560]   so how many sacrifices were given?
[00:37:45.560 --> 00:37:48.480]   How many sacrifices were given?
[00:37:48.480 --> 00:37:50.440]   I don't know the number.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:55.040]   We do have the actual number during the time of Christ, during the Passover, or the Day
[00:37:55.040 --> 00:37:59.480]   of Atonement, like how many animals were sacrificed because they kept record at that time.
[00:37:59.480 --> 00:38:03.080]   But on a day-to-day basis, while they were wandering through the desert, I mean, no one
[00:38:03.080 --> 00:38:04.820]   knows for sure.
[00:38:04.820 --> 00:38:12.160]   My guess is, one, for financial reasons, not a lot of people did it often, right?
[00:38:12.160 --> 00:38:15.160]   Because it costs a lot of money to give these animals.
[00:38:15.160 --> 00:38:20.640]   Secondly, I think a lot of people didn't do it because they were scared, too, to come
[00:38:20.640 --> 00:38:23.640]   to the tabernacle.
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:29.640]   So you have financial, but even if you were wealthy and it didn't mean a whole lot to
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.360]   you, I think people would have thought twice when they approached God.
[00:38:34.360 --> 00:38:39.760]   It was kind of like a double-edged sword where you want to go to God to receive His blessing,
[00:38:39.760 --> 00:38:43.180]   but if you approach God in the wrong way, you can die from it.
[00:38:43.180 --> 00:38:48.720]   But yet, that's where you find life and death, right?
[00:38:48.720 --> 00:38:49.720]   That was the tabernacle.
[00:38:49.720 --> 00:38:54.840]   It was the blessing and cursing that was being carried out, the blessing and cursing right
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:38:56.720]   at the tabernacle.
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.120]   It was literally, if God blessed you, then you would multiply and you would have many
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:03.680]   children and land and all of that.
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.660]   That comes with God's blessing.
[00:39:05.660 --> 00:39:11.820]   But if you come to God in an unworthy manner, you had the exact opposite, right?
[00:39:11.820 --> 00:39:17.740]   So again, I just want you to have that picture in your head because this is what He was implanting
[00:39:17.740 --> 00:39:19.660]   in the nation of Israel.
[00:39:19.660 --> 00:39:25.560]   These are the things, even if you don't understand the details, the big picture, right?
[00:39:25.560 --> 00:39:32.600]   Every Jew who lived practicing these regulations, and think about it if you were a Jew, when
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:39.540]   the scripture talks about fear and trembling, I don't think any Jew would have struggled
[00:39:39.540 --> 00:39:41.860]   with that, right?
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:47.300]   To fear God because it's embedded into their culture.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:50.860]   It doesn't say, the tabernacle doesn't say come, you know, come to the tabernacle.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:52.540]   It doesn't say come.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:56.900]   It said you need to come if you want your sins atoned for, but when you come, you should
[00:39:56.900 --> 00:40:03.360]   be very, very, very, very careful in the way you approach God, right?
[00:40:03.360 --> 00:40:10.820]   So when the scripture says to fear the Lord, right, is the chief end of man, I think every
[00:40:10.820 --> 00:40:15.940]   Jew would not have had a problem, where in the New Testament, when we talk about fearing
[00:40:15.940 --> 00:40:21.580]   God, our immediate response is like, how do I understand fear in God when everything I'm
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:27.100]   taught is to love God, right, embrace God, you know, and come to God?
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:29.180]   Because that's so embedded into our mind.
[00:40:29.180 --> 00:40:34.360]   That's kind of like our default setting is this gracious and loving and gentle and merciful,
[00:40:34.360 --> 00:40:40.000]   forgiving God, and then it says to fear God because we have this picture of a great-grandfather
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:44.080]   who just passes out candy, and no matter what you do, he loves you, and that's the default
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:48.160]   setting that we have of God, and then when you look at the Old Testament, it's completely
[00:40:48.160 --> 00:40:50.820]   the opposite, right?
[00:40:50.820 --> 00:40:52.600]   It doesn't mean that God wasn't merciful.
[00:40:52.600 --> 00:40:59.780]   It wasn't to mean God wasn't gracious because all of this was to set up for his grace, right?
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.500]   All of this was to set up for the mercy.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.700]   All of this was to set up for the cross, but if you don't understand this aspect about
[00:41:05.700 --> 00:41:10.580]   God, the cross does not make sense.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:16.420]   It doesn't make sense because the natural question that you should have, if you don't
[00:41:16.420 --> 00:41:22.400]   understand this aspect of God's nature, why didn't he just forgive us?
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:23.540]   Why go through all that drama?
[00:41:23.540 --> 00:41:24.540]   Why shading of the blood?
[00:41:24.540 --> 00:41:27.220]   Why the Son of God coming through all of that drama?
[00:41:27.220 --> 00:41:31.200]   Why did that have to be that way, right?
[00:41:31.200 --> 00:41:34.100]   That would be the natural question.
[00:41:34.100 --> 00:41:36.700]   Just forgive him, right?
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.020]   All of this was to set up the necessity of the cross, of Christ, the Son of God coming.
[00:41:42.020 --> 00:41:48.440]   So if we have a superficial understanding of the nature and character of God, it translates
[00:41:48.440 --> 00:41:51.980]   into the way we approach God in the New Testament.
[00:41:51.980 --> 00:41:54.580]   It translates into the way we handle the Bible.
[00:41:54.580 --> 00:41:59.940]   It translates into the way we understand lordship, the way we understand salvation, the way we
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:05.380]   understand sanctification, the way we understand heaven, a personal relationship with God.
[00:42:05.380 --> 00:42:13.740]   All of that gets tainted and superficial where we say God is the center, but he really is
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:16.140]   not, right?
[00:42:16.140 --> 00:42:17.140]   We call him Lord.
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.640]   Remember Jesus said, "You call me Lord, Lord, but your heart is far from me," right?
[00:42:21.640 --> 00:42:26.700]   When we don't understand this about who God is, we can call him Lord, but he really isn't.
[00:42:26.700 --> 00:42:27.700]   We are the Lord.
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:30.100]   We're trying to get God to bend toward us.
[00:42:30.100 --> 00:42:35.740]   But this was established in the nation of Israel for that purpose, to make sure, right,
[00:42:35.740 --> 00:42:42.580]   when Christ comes, that we understand Christ based upon this foundation, right?
[00:42:42.580 --> 00:42:44.460]   Again, it's not comprehensive.
[00:42:44.460 --> 00:42:46.180]   It's not all of it.
[00:42:46.180 --> 00:42:48.100]   There's a couple more things.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:52.380]   The fat of an animal that dies in itself, that you're not to eat of it, you're forbidden
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:42:53.380]   to eat.
[00:42:53.380 --> 00:42:58.500]   And then finally, they are never to eat the blood of any animal.
[00:42:58.500 --> 00:43:00.020]   What's the consequence?
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.900]   You will be cut off.
[00:43:04.900 --> 00:43:10.220]   You can't eat the flesh of the animal that's already dead, right?
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:12.860]   And you can't drink the blood.
[00:43:12.860 --> 00:43:15.860]   It's forbidden.
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:20.100]   So imagine that if you're a Jew, and this is what was taught as a foundation, and clean
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:24.860]   and unclean is so, like, precise, right?
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:26.380]   Right now, we're only getting the regulations.
[00:43:26.380 --> 00:43:32.300]   So rest of Israel's history is when they violate this, judgment coming upon them, right?
[00:43:32.300 --> 00:43:34.780]   So this is all established.
[00:43:34.780 --> 00:43:36.900]   And then what happens in the New Testament?
[00:43:36.900 --> 00:43:39.500]   Jesus comes, and remember John chapter 6?
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:41.460]   53 to 58?
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:45.060]   I don't think I have the verse.
[00:43:45.060 --> 00:43:47.460]   Can somebody read that?
[00:43:47.460 --> 00:43:54.260]   John chapter 6, 53 to 58.
[00:43:54.260 --> 00:43:57.260]   Whoever gets there first.
[00:43:57.260 --> 00:44:10.260]   Read it out loud.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:20.260]   [inaudible]
[00:44:20.260 --> 00:44:36.260]   Okay, that's good.
[00:44:36.260 --> 00:44:45.260]   All right.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:47.260]   We get extra pizza today.
[00:44:47.260 --> 00:44:48.260]   All right.
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.260]   All right.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:54.260]   God, very precise, and this is not the only place.
[00:44:54.260 --> 00:44:56.260]   He repeats this over and over again.
[00:44:56.260 --> 00:45:03.260]   You cannot, it's sacrilegious to eat the blood of anybody, especially a human being, right?
[00:45:03.260 --> 00:45:07.260]   I mean, human sacrifice was detestable, worthy of death.
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:12.260]   And Jesus says in John chapter 6, if you do not drink of my blood and eat of my flesh,
[00:45:12.260 --> 00:45:15.260]   you have no relations with me.
[00:45:15.260 --> 00:45:16.260]   Right?
[00:45:16.260 --> 00:45:20.260]   So imagine how a Jew would have heard that.
[00:45:20.260 --> 00:45:22.260]   And what's their response?
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   John 6, 6, 6.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:29.260]   From that time on, they turned away, and they stopped following the Lord.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.260]   Right?
[00:45:30.260 --> 00:45:36.260]   So in their natural mind, they couldn't accept this, because it goes against what the Scripture says.
[00:45:36.260 --> 00:45:37.260]   Right?
[00:45:37.260 --> 00:45:41.260]   Obviously, Jesus was not meaning that you have to actually drink my blood and eat my flesh.
[00:45:41.260 --> 00:45:47.260]   He's already talking to a group of people whose heart and their hearts, he said he is the bread of life,
[00:45:47.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   and they keep saying, "Well, prove yourself, prove yourself."
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:51.260]   Right?
[00:45:51.260 --> 00:45:55.260]   So he's not talking to Christians and drawing those people to himself.
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:58.260]   He already knows what's in their heart, and he's basically shutting the door on them.
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:45:59.260]   Right?
[00:45:59.260 --> 00:46:02.260]   But think about what he is saying.
[00:46:02.260 --> 00:46:10.260]   If you drink of any other animal's blood, because the life of the animal is in the blood, you will die.
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:15.260]   But if you drink the blood of Jesus, you will live.
[00:46:15.260 --> 00:46:17.260]   Right?
[00:46:17.260 --> 00:46:24.260]   If you touch something that was holy, set apart, and you touch it, you become holy, but not holy in a good sense.
[00:46:24.260 --> 00:46:26.260]   You become tainted, in a sense.
[00:46:26.260 --> 00:46:29.260]   And you have to go through the ritual cleansing.
[00:46:29.260 --> 00:46:33.260]   But if you drink the blood of Christ, instead of you dying, what happens?
[00:46:33.260 --> 00:46:35.260]   You live.
[00:46:35.260 --> 00:46:39.260]   And you become holy.
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:44.260]   Now, some of you are like, "I still don't get it."
[00:46:44.260 --> 00:46:49.260]   If you connect the dots, and I'm not trying to answer every single question.
[00:46:49.260 --> 00:46:50.260]   Right?
[00:46:50.260 --> 00:46:52.260]   Because I don't know the answer to every single question.
[00:46:52.260 --> 00:46:55.260]   I'm just trying to show you the large, big picture.
[00:46:55.260 --> 00:47:06.260]   Because in the law, it taught that these holy things are separated from God, and if you touch it, you become holy.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.260]   But you need to cleanse yourself, because you weren't meant to be.
[00:47:09.260 --> 00:47:10.260]   Right?
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:16.260]   There was nothing more unholy than drinking the blood, but actually, it's going inside of you.
[00:47:16.260 --> 00:47:19.260]   And it says, "You shall surely die."
[00:47:19.260 --> 00:47:22.260]   But Jesus says, "But the blood I give you will make you live."
[00:47:22.260 --> 00:47:25.260]   In fact, if you don't drink of it, you shall surely die.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:30.260]   Right?
[00:47:30.260 --> 00:47:35.260]   And the communion table, right, ultimately is a reflection of this.
[00:47:35.260 --> 00:47:37.260]   Because at the communion table, what do we say?
[00:47:37.260 --> 00:47:39.260]   We drink of his blood and eat of his flesh.
[00:47:39.260 --> 00:47:47.260]   So we are celebrating the fulfillment of this particular sacrifice, the peace offering.
[00:47:47.260 --> 00:47:49.260]   At the communion table, and we are drinking the blood.
[00:47:49.260 --> 00:47:52.260]   Exactly what he said you can't do, of the animal.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:56.260]   But when we drink of the blood of Christ, we become cleansed.
[00:47:56.260 --> 00:47:58.260]   And that's what we celebrate at the communion table.
[00:47:58.260 --> 00:48:03.260]   So the communion table was never meant to be done in isolation, just like this sacrifice.
[00:48:03.260 --> 00:48:06.260]   This sacrifice was God, the priest, and the people.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:07.260]   Right?
[00:48:07.260 --> 00:48:10.260]   So the communion table was not meant to be done in isolation.
[00:48:10.260 --> 00:48:13.260]   And that's why we don't practice communion at weddings.
[00:48:13.260 --> 00:48:17.260]   You know, where it's not meant to be between you and your husband and God.
[00:48:17.260 --> 00:48:23.260]   Like a romantic picture, it's meant to be done in the body of Christ, in celebration.
[00:48:23.260 --> 00:48:24.260]   Right?
[00:48:24.260 --> 00:48:27.260]   Because he does not acknowledge the body of Christ, right?
[00:48:27.260 --> 00:48:29.260]   He eats and drinks judgment upon himself.
[00:48:29.260 --> 00:48:36.260]   So it was meant to understand that peace with God is what established peace with man.
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:43.260]   So this offering ultimately points to the communion table.
[00:48:43.260 --> 00:48:54.260]   And then ultimately it points to the feast in heaven.
[00:48:54.260 --> 00:49:00.260]   Can somebody turn to Revelation 19, 6-9?
[00:49:00.260 --> 00:49:05.260]   Let's give him a minute.
[00:49:05.260 --> 00:49:08.260]   Revelation chapter 19, 6-9.
[00:49:08.260 --> 00:49:32.260]   Somebody in the back so we can all hear it.
[00:49:32.260 --> 00:49:33.260]   Okay.
[00:49:33.260 --> 00:49:34.260]   All right, thank you.
[00:49:34.260 --> 00:49:41.260]   So if you remember, Revelation chapter 19 is at the very end when Christ comes to establish his kingdom.
[00:49:41.260 --> 00:49:47.260]   And he describes his kingdom, right, the beginning of the kingdom as the marriage supper of the lamb.
[00:49:47.260 --> 00:49:48.260]   Right?
[00:49:48.260 --> 00:49:52.260]   And oftentimes Jesus describes the kingdom as what?
[00:49:52.260 --> 00:49:55.260]   He sent his son and he threw a banquet.
[00:49:55.260 --> 00:49:56.260]   Right?
[00:49:56.260 --> 00:49:58.260]   And he invited the people and some of them didn't come.
[00:49:58.260 --> 00:50:02.260]   So they go out in the streets and then they bring the strangers to come into the banquet.
[00:50:02.260 --> 00:50:05.260]   So oftentimes the kingdom of God is described as a banquet.
[00:50:05.260 --> 00:50:15.260]   So when we see these sacrifices, right, all three of them, one is the burnt offering where God unilaterally does it himself
[00:50:15.260 --> 00:50:18.260]   and he establishes relationship with sinful people.
[00:50:18.260 --> 00:50:22.260]   And then because of that, there is a celebration that takes place.
[00:50:22.260 --> 00:50:23.260]   Right?
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:26.260]   And this banqueting table.
[00:50:26.260 --> 00:50:30.260]   So if you notice the beginning, salvation.
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:34.260]   Second, the priest and we are called what?
[00:50:34.260 --> 00:50:36.260]   Holy priests, right?
[00:50:36.260 --> 00:50:41.260]   Like Israelites, they were the holy nation, a priest set apart for God's use.
[00:50:41.260 --> 00:50:44.260]   In the New Testament, we are the holy nation.
[00:50:44.260 --> 00:50:45.260]   Right?
[00:50:45.260 --> 00:50:52.260]   What is the, why does God establish priesthood?
[00:50:52.260 --> 00:50:58.260]   What function did the priest function in the Old Testament?
[00:50:58.260 --> 00:51:00.260]   They were mediators, right?
[00:51:00.260 --> 00:51:03.260]   They mediated between God, a holy God, and sinful people.
[00:51:03.260 --> 00:51:06.260]   Why do you need a mediator?
[00:51:06.260 --> 00:51:13.260]   In what context in our life do we need mediation?
[00:51:13.260 --> 00:51:17.260]   To be reconciled because there is some problem with the relationship.
[00:51:17.260 --> 00:51:18.260]   Right?
[00:51:18.260 --> 00:51:21.260]   They don't agree on something and somebody needs to come and mediate.
[00:51:21.260 --> 00:51:22.260]   Right?
[00:51:22.260 --> 00:51:23.260]   And that's what the priests were for.
[00:51:23.260 --> 00:51:25.260]   The priests stood between God and man.
[00:51:25.260 --> 00:51:26.260]   Right?
[00:51:26.260 --> 00:51:30.260]   And so if you look at these three different group of offerings,
[00:51:30.260 --> 00:51:33.260]   you have God who gives, brings salvation.
[00:51:33.260 --> 00:51:36.260]   You have the priests, right?
[00:51:36.260 --> 00:51:40.260]   You have the priests, the church that receives it and evangelizes.
[00:51:40.260 --> 00:51:46.260]   And then the third part where non-Christians come, there is a celebration.
[00:51:46.260 --> 00:51:51.260]   The Bible talks about how when one sinner repents, the whole heavens rejoices.
[00:51:51.260 --> 00:51:52.260]   Right?
[00:51:52.260 --> 00:51:57.260]   And so you see this picture of the gospel, right, coming to man.
[00:51:57.260 --> 00:51:59.260]   God drawing near to man.
[00:51:59.260 --> 00:52:01.260]   And it ends in a celebration.
[00:52:01.260 --> 00:52:02.260]   Right?
[00:52:02.260 --> 00:52:04.260]   Which is described in Revelation chapter 19.
[00:52:04.260 --> 00:52:07.260]   So all of this ultimately points to Christ.
[00:52:07.260 --> 00:52:12.260]   Coming of Christ, spreading of Christ, and rejoicing of Christ.
[00:52:12.260 --> 00:52:14.260]   Does that make sense?
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:19.260]   So all of this stuff, like I said in the beginning, all of this stuff may not make complete sense.
[00:52:19.260 --> 00:52:22.260]   There's a lot of little detail that still may be fuzzy to you.
[00:52:22.260 --> 00:52:27.260]   But as you're studying it, if you do your best to try to figure out how these dots connect,
[00:52:27.260 --> 00:52:31.260]   so much of the New Testament will make much more sense.
[00:52:31.260 --> 00:52:35.260]   That nothing that he did is random.
[00:52:35.260 --> 00:52:36.260]   We just don't fully understand it.
[00:52:36.260 --> 00:52:38.260]   But there's meaning behind it.
[00:52:38.260 --> 00:52:41.260]   The more you study the Bible, the more it will make sense.
[00:52:41.260 --> 00:52:42.260]   Right?
[00:52:42.260 --> 00:52:44.260]   I don't know about you, but it's amazing.
[00:52:44.260 --> 00:52:50.260]   Even after all these years, you dig through the scripture, and you see so much of what you thought you knew.
[00:52:50.260 --> 00:52:54.260]   It wasn't that you were wrong, but you only knew it superficially.
[00:52:54.260 --> 00:52:58.260]   And then when you start to see the depth of what God was doing, and that all of it,
[00:52:58.260 --> 00:53:04.260]   when he says that before the creation of the world, I knew you, and then he came after us in Ephesians chapter 1,
[00:53:04.260 --> 00:53:09.260]   and then you begin to see the traces of his imprint, of his game plan,
[00:53:09.260 --> 00:53:12.260]   what he was doing through Israel's history, you actually see it.
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.260]   We knew it, but we start seeing it.
[00:53:15.260 --> 00:53:16.260]   Right?
[00:53:16.260 --> 00:53:21.260]   And then all of a sudden, God becomes so much more real than just thinking of him in theory,
[00:53:21.260 --> 00:53:26.260]   because God, in a tangible way, left his imprint.
[00:53:26.260 --> 00:53:29.260]   There was a blueprint that he was following all this time.
[00:53:29.260 --> 00:53:30.260]   So we weren't just random.
[00:53:30.260 --> 00:53:37.260]   So even though we don't know, us personally, we don't know where the blueprint is, how we got here.
[00:53:37.260 --> 00:53:41.260]   But when you start to see the blueprint of what God was doing in history, through Israel,
[00:53:41.260 --> 00:53:46.260]   and then the church, and how we got here, you know that there was a blueprint for you.
[00:53:46.260 --> 00:53:51.260]   You know that there was a blueprint for you, because that's how God works.
[00:53:51.260 --> 00:53:57.260]   So when he says, "All things work together for good for those who love him," right?
[00:53:57.260 --> 00:54:01.260]   "All things work together for good, who have been called according to his purpose."
[00:54:01.260 --> 00:54:09.260]   That everything good and the things that you think are bad are part of God's blueprint that got us here.
[00:54:09.260 --> 00:54:11.260]   Right?
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:15.260]   And I think that's why it's so interesting when you study the Old Testament,
[00:54:15.260 --> 00:54:21.260]   because you see the blueprint in a larger scale, which ultimately points to the blueprint in a smaller scale.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:23.260]   Okay?
[00:54:23.260 --> 00:54:24.260]   All right, so the three discussions.
[00:54:24.260 --> 00:54:28.260]   What aspect of your salvation are you the most thankful for, and why?
[00:54:28.260 --> 00:54:34.260]   Again, example, redemption, adoption, eternal life, forgiveness, and obviously there's other aspects of it.
[00:54:34.260 --> 00:54:39.260]   But what aspects of it have you recently thought about and that you're thankful for?
[00:54:39.260 --> 00:54:41.260]   Are certain things more holy than others?
[00:54:41.260 --> 00:54:45.260]   What do you think they are, and why?
[00:54:45.260 --> 00:54:49.260]   Third, how do you normally celebrate when something great happens in your life?
[00:54:49.260 --> 00:54:53.260]   Do you think how you live your life reflects how you feel about your own salvation?
[00:54:53.260 --> 00:54:58.260]   Other than Sunday, other than singing loud and things that we do on church.
[00:54:58.260 --> 00:55:06.260]   Is there a reasonable response in the way that we celebrate our salvation outside of Sunday?
[00:55:06.260 --> 00:55:09.260]   What should our celebration look like outside of Sunday?
[00:55:09.260 --> 00:55:10.260]   I already said that.
[00:55:10.260 --> 00:55:11.260]   All right.
[00:55:11.260 --> 00:55:17.260]   All right, so let me pray for us, and then I'll give you guys time to get into your small group.
[00:55:17.260 --> 00:55:21.260]   Heavenly Father, we want to continue to thank you for your goodness.
[00:55:21.260 --> 00:55:31.260]   And as we dig into things that are at times difficult to understand, we know, Father, that none of this was random.
[00:55:31.260 --> 00:55:34.260]   That it's not just history.
[00:55:34.260 --> 00:55:40.260]   But every part of this, Lord God, helps us to understand what you've done, what we already celebrate week after week.
[00:55:40.260 --> 00:55:47.260]   I pray that as we deepen our understanding of who you are and what you've done, that our love for you may also deepen.
[00:55:47.260 --> 00:55:51.260]   Our celebration of our salvation, Lord God, would be genuine.
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:55:53.260]   That our hearts may be transformed.
[00:55:53.260 --> 00:56:04.260]   That as we see the depth of your love, depth of your plan, Father God, for us, that we would not be able to resist but to love you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:56:04.260 --> 00:56:07.260]   I pray that you would bless us in our time of discussion.
[00:56:07.260 --> 00:56:10.260]   Help us to be vulnerable and open and honest.
[00:56:10.260 --> 00:56:14.260]   Help us to celebrate and spur one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:56:14.260 --> 00:56:16.860]   We thank you in Jesus name we pray, amen.
