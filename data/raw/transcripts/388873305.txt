[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.120]   - Good morning, okay.
[00:00:06.120 --> 00:00:15.920]   Now we're going to be going through BCC Covenant number 10 this morning, and I'm sure as you
[00:00:15.920 --> 00:00:22.120]   guys have been able to see in our announcement sheet, the title of the sermon is called A
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:24.760]   Sermon on BCC Covenant number 10.
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:29.040]   A Sermon on BCC Covenant number 10.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:35.880]   The reason I chose that as a title was because as I was just kind of preparing for today's
[00:00:35.880 --> 00:00:41.080]   sermon it dawned on me there are many different ways I could have approached this, many different
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:42.620]   ways, right?
[00:00:42.620 --> 00:00:44.440]   And I'm approaching it one way.
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:50.000]   And so because I'm approaching it one way, it is not the sermon on BCC Covenant number
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   10.
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.920]   It is not the perspective on BCC Covenant number 10.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:59.720]   It is A Sermon on BCC Covenant number 10.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.440]   Now the covenant point reads as follows.
[00:01:03.440 --> 00:01:09.280]   I desire to be kept accountable by the leadership and other members at BCC and to keep others
[00:01:09.280 --> 00:01:14.320]   accountable of the above covenants and teachings of scripture.
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:20.160]   As you guys already know, you guys are very well familiar by now, every single covenant
[00:01:20.160 --> 00:01:26.600]   point is not a covenant point that is in addition to the scriptures, right?
[00:01:26.600 --> 00:01:28.280]   It is not added onto the scriptures.
[00:01:28.280 --> 00:01:32.880]   It's not like they're the scriptures, but we're going to be Berean and we're going to
[00:01:32.880 --> 00:01:35.160]   go beyond scripture and add something else.
[00:01:35.160 --> 00:01:38.520]   In fact, there's a direct prohibition against that.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:41.080]   Paul says do not go beyond scripture.
[00:01:41.080 --> 00:01:48.000]   Rather, what the covenant points are, including this one, it's a summation of teachings in
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:53.960]   the scripture that are made more easily digestible and for various reasons that are included
[00:01:53.960 --> 00:01:55.840]   in the covenant point.
[00:01:55.840 --> 00:02:02.600]   Now for that reason, I'm going to go over a lot of verses today, a hefty amount of verses
[00:02:02.600 --> 00:02:03.600]   today.
[00:02:03.600 --> 00:02:10.500]   The reason I chose to do it in that manner is because I want to show you that this topic
[00:02:10.500 --> 00:02:13.320]   is spoken widely throughout scripture.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:18.880]   It's not something that BCC decided to hinge on one verse.
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:23.480]   We want to do this this way, so let's find a verse and let's hinge on it.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   Rather, scriptures speak of this covenant point in detail and in many different places.
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:36.680]   I'm going to approach this morning's sermon via three points.
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:39.160]   They're going to be three points.
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:45.920]   Peer accountability, submission to elders, the example, reason, and the goal.
[00:02:45.920 --> 00:02:48.240]   I want to say that again.
[00:02:48.240 --> 00:02:55.120]   Peer accountability, submission to elders, the example, reason, and the goal.
[00:02:55.120 --> 00:02:58.160]   Number one is going to be connected with number three.
[00:02:58.160 --> 00:03:00.720]   Number two is going to be connected with number three.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:03.880]   It doesn't make any sense now, but it should.
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:05.960]   But before we do that, let's pray.
[00:03:05.960 --> 00:03:14.440]   Father, we come before you this morning ready to hear your word.
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:19.720]   Not man's word, not what man has to say, but your word.
[00:03:19.720 --> 00:03:26.880]   If there is anything that I say that is from man, please take it away and lay for your
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:33.920]   children only the pure seed of the word of God and may that, the word of God, be implanted
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:40.960]   into every individual and may that be the vehicle that causes fruit.
[00:03:40.960 --> 00:03:43.720]   Open up your word this morning.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:47.240]   We ask and pray these things in the name of your son.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.600]   Amen.
[00:03:48.600 --> 00:03:52.640]   Peer accountability, point number one, peer accountability.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:55.560]   It stems from this portion of the covenant.
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:01.280]   I desire to be kept accountable by other members at BCC and to keep others accountable.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:08.320]   I desire to be kept accountable by other members at BCC and to keep others accountable.
[00:04:08.320 --> 00:04:15.240]   Now, the fact that I told you that the Bible speaks extensively about accountability won't
[00:04:15.240 --> 00:04:19.040]   come as a shock to probably anyone in this room.
[00:04:19.040 --> 00:04:22.980]   The Bible speaks extensively about accountability.
[00:04:22.980 --> 00:04:28.520]   It talks about it in very explicit terms, but it also talks about it in very implicit
[00:04:28.520 --> 00:04:29.520]   terms.
[00:04:29.520 --> 00:04:33.080]   I'll give you an example of an implicit way it speaks of accountability.
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:39.800]   Every time the Bible says that we are part of one body, that necessitates that you're
[00:04:39.800 --> 00:04:41.240]   in a community.
[00:04:41.240 --> 00:04:45.680]   Every time the Bible speaks of us being in one body, that means that you can't live on,
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:51.040]   like, intentionally live on an island and practice faithful Christianity.
[00:04:51.040 --> 00:04:59.880]   Every time the scriptures say, "Love one another, be kind to one another, exhort one another,
[00:04:59.880 --> 00:05:05.800]   meet one another," that necessitates the concept of a community.
[00:05:05.800 --> 00:05:10.320]   Now, let me take a step further to equate this with accountability.
[00:05:10.320 --> 00:05:15.440]   I don't think anyone follows those commandments perfectly.
[00:05:15.440 --> 00:05:18.000]   I don't think anyone follows those commandments perfectly.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:19.280]   We're called to love one another.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:20.280]   We're called to be patient.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:21.280]   We're called to be kind.
[00:05:21.280 --> 00:05:22.280]   We're called to exhort.
[00:05:22.280 --> 00:05:23.280]   We're called to rebuke.
[00:05:23.280 --> 00:05:27.880]   We're called to do much more, and no one does it perfectly.
[00:05:27.880 --> 00:05:35.000]   And so there, the idea of accountability is born implicitly, but also very explicitly,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:36.080]   right?
[00:05:36.080 --> 00:05:40.320]   Just so that we don't take anything for granted, I want to read to you a lot of verses.
[00:05:40.320 --> 00:05:42.120]   There's going to be a lot of verses on the screen.
[00:05:42.120 --> 00:05:45.160]   You don't have to turn there because I'm going to be going through a lot, okay?
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:47.680]   But just try to follow with me mentally, okay?
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:55.440]   1 Thessalonians 5.11 says this, "Therefore, encourage one another and build up one another
[00:05:55.440 --> 00:05:58.000]   just as you also are doing."
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.440]   Proverbs 27.17 says this, "Iron sharpens iron, so one man sharpens another."
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.520]   Ecclesiastes 4.9-10, "Two are better than one because they have a good return for their
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:09.520]   labor.
[00:06:09.520 --> 00:06:12.760]   For if either of them falls, the one will lift up his companion.
[00:06:12.760 --> 00:06:16.520]   But woe to the one who falls when there is not another to lift him up."
[00:06:16.520 --> 00:06:20.200]   Luke 17.3-4, "Be on your guard.
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:22.720]   If your brother sins, rebuke him.
[00:06:22.720 --> 00:06:25.120]   If he repents, forgive him.
[00:06:25.120 --> 00:06:30.720]   And if he sins against you seven times a day and returns to you seven times saying, 'I
[00:06:30.720 --> 00:06:33.680]   repent,' forgive him."
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:35.600]   Explicit commands.
[00:06:35.600 --> 00:06:37.960]   And the verses go on.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:41.020]   Now, so the commands are apparent.
[00:06:41.020 --> 00:06:42.560]   The commands are apparent.
[00:06:42.560 --> 00:06:47.800]   But in order to fully understand accountability, I want to talk about the why for a second.
[00:06:47.800 --> 00:06:49.480]   I want to talk about the why.
[00:06:49.480 --> 00:06:52.200]   The why in conjunction with the context.
[00:06:52.200 --> 00:06:55.840]   In order to do that, let's go to the beginning.
[00:06:55.840 --> 00:07:04.320]   When you and I became a Christian, when you and I were converted, what happened?
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:07.520]   We went from darkness to light, right?
[00:07:07.520 --> 00:07:09.160]   You've all seen pitch darkness.
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:11.080]   You can't see a thing.
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:17.000]   You went from that state, darkness, complete, utter darkness, right?
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:18.360]   You were a dead horse.
[00:07:18.360 --> 00:07:22.300]   You weren't just a bad man or a bad woman, right, that God made good.
[00:07:22.300 --> 00:07:25.400]   You were a dead man that is now alive.
[00:07:25.400 --> 00:07:28.160]   A dead woman that is now alive.
[00:07:28.160 --> 00:07:31.720]   That is how the scriptures speak of conversion.
[00:07:31.720 --> 00:07:37.320]   So naturally what flows from that is that things change about your life.
[00:07:37.320 --> 00:07:43.080]   The way you view things, your value system, your interests, your hobbies, your pursuits.
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:47.560]   Because your pursuits and your interests and your hobbies and your value system before
[00:07:47.560 --> 00:07:51.760]   were that of a dead man, were that of a blind man, right?
[00:07:51.760 --> 00:07:53.560]   But now you are alive.
[00:07:53.560 --> 00:07:55.080]   Now you can see.
[00:07:55.080 --> 00:07:58.200]   You are in the light.
[00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:00.040]   But the problem is this.
[00:08:00.040 --> 00:08:01.920]   The problem is this.
[00:08:01.920 --> 00:08:09.160]   Even though the scriptures clearly speak of our salvation as one that is final and victorious,
[00:08:09.160 --> 00:08:13.840]   I don't need to convince you that we still stumble.
[00:08:13.840 --> 00:08:16.640]   We still stumble.
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:19.680]   We live in this fallen tent.
[00:08:19.680 --> 00:08:22.280]   We still live in the flesh.
[00:08:22.280 --> 00:08:27.240]   If you were to read portions of scripture in a vacuum, and you're not a human being,
[00:08:27.240 --> 00:08:31.680]   you're just some apparition, you're reading portions of scripture in a vacuum, you might
[00:08:31.680 --> 00:08:37.600]   not understand that the believer is still living in the fallen flesh.
[00:08:37.600 --> 00:08:38.600]   But we are.
[00:08:38.600 --> 00:08:41.600]   But we are.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:48.400]   Ephesians 2, 5 through 6, and 21 through 22 gives this juxtaposition a little bit more
[00:08:48.400 --> 00:08:49.400]   clear, okay?
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.760]   Let me read it to you and you'll see what I'm talking about.
[00:08:51.760 --> 00:08:54.320]   Ephesians 2, 5 through 6 says this.
[00:08:54.320 --> 00:08:58.960]   Even when we were dead in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ, by grace
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:02.960]   we have been saved, and raised us up with him, and seated us with him in the heavenly
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:04.960]   places in Christ Jesus.
[00:09:04.960 --> 00:09:10.520]   In the same chapter, in verses 21 through 22, it says this.
[00:09:10.520 --> 00:09:18.560]   In whom the whole building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord,
[00:09:18.560 --> 00:09:26.080]   in whom also, you also, are being built together into a dwelling of God in the Spirit.
[00:09:26.080 --> 00:09:30.440]   If you were to read 2, 5, 6 in a vacuum, Ephesians 2, 5, 6, you would think, "Well, we're with
[00:09:30.440 --> 00:09:34.800]   him in the heavenly places, and that's it."
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:41.760]   But at the same time, we are being fitted together, we're growing into a holy temple,
[00:09:41.760 --> 00:09:48.580]   and we are being built together into a dwelling of God by Spirit.
[00:09:48.580 --> 00:09:53.240]   We live in the fallen tent.
[00:09:53.240 --> 00:09:59.920]   But even though our salvation is one of complete victory, there is the now that we have to
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:04.560]   contend with that is very much true.
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:13.360]   But on top of that, on top of living in a fallen tent, we also live in a fallen world.
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.320]   Now let me be clear here.
[00:10:16.320 --> 00:10:22.320]   God is in complete control of every single event since the creation of time.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.400]   Every single atom that bumps into another atom, he's in control of.
[00:10:27.400 --> 00:10:30.440]   Everything has been already preordained.
[00:10:30.440 --> 00:10:37.760]   But within that umbrella, within that umbrella of God's omniscience and sovereignty, there
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:43.240]   is an aspect in which this world is under the control of the evil one.
[00:10:43.240 --> 00:10:50.720]   If it was in every angle in control of Christ, there would be no sin in this world.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:55.840]   But it is still in control of the evil one.
[00:10:55.840 --> 00:11:00.440]   On top of that, you have the wicked one himself.
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:08.280]   So we are victorious in Christ, but we live in a fallen tent, we live in a fallen world,
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.240]   and we still have to contend with the wicked one.
[00:11:11.240 --> 00:11:18.680]   Ephesians 2.2 and 6.12 says this, "The prince of the power of the air, of the spirit that
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:21.240]   is now working, and the sons of disobedience."
[00:11:21.240 --> 00:11:26.040]   6.12 says this, "For our struggle is not against flesh and blood, but against rulers, against
[00:11:26.040 --> 00:11:31.560]   powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:33.960]   in the heavenly places."
[00:11:33.960 --> 00:11:42.440]   It is in that context that Peter says in 1 Peter 5.8, "Be of sober spirit, be on the
[00:11:42.440 --> 00:11:43.440]   alert.
[00:11:43.440 --> 00:11:51.440]   Be not like Jerry the devil, prowls around like a roaring lion, seeking someone to devour."
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.280]   That is the reality.
[00:11:53.280 --> 00:11:55.680]   Why accountability?
[00:11:55.680 --> 00:11:57.880]   Why accountability?
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:11:59.900]   Because that is the reality.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:01.920]   Let me add another layer to this.
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.840]   Jeremiah 17.9 says this, "The heart is more deceitful than all else, and is desperately
[00:12:07.840 --> 00:12:08.840]   sick."
[00:12:08.840 --> 00:12:10.440]   Who can understand it?
[00:12:10.440 --> 00:12:14.960]   The heart is deceitful, more deceitful than all else, and is desperately sick.
[00:12:14.960 --> 00:12:16.000]   Who can understand it?
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:21.360]   Now at this point in time, I don't want to go into, I get Jeremiah, and I get that we
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:25.680]   have the mind of Christ, I don't want to go into the theological implications of that.
[00:12:25.680 --> 00:12:39.360]   However, the principle behind this, that sin is so sublime, so subtle, so beguiling, that
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:47.520]   it can trick you, that it can trick me, that is the very nature of sin.
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:51.400]   Maybe you know, or maybe you don't know.
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:12:55.300]   Maybe you're wise, maybe you're not wise.
[00:12:55.300 --> 00:13:01.040]   Maybe you know the scripture, maybe you don't know the scripture.
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:04.040]   So yes, we are absolutely saved.
[00:13:04.040 --> 00:13:07.000]   We are seated with Him in the heavenly places.
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:11.440]   But what is also true at the same time is we are being sanctified right now, we are
[00:13:11.440 --> 00:13:17.320]   being fitted together, so we still live in a fallen tent, in a fallen world, under the
[00:13:17.320 --> 00:13:24.040]   control of the wicked one, and sin is that deceitful.
[00:13:24.040 --> 00:13:26.680]   Why accountability?
[00:13:26.680 --> 00:13:29.480]   Why accountability?
[00:13:29.480 --> 00:13:38.600]   If you're of sober spirit, and you understand the reality that is, this will not be a question
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:40.560]   for you.
[00:13:40.560 --> 00:13:41.960]   This will not be a question for you.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:46.320]   I'm not saying that you better get plugged into some church program.
[00:13:46.320 --> 00:13:51.040]   There's not enough programs at church to plug everyone into an accountability group.
[00:13:51.040 --> 00:13:55.400]   But in the pursuit of Christ and the abstaining of sin, what is also true is that you and
[00:13:55.400 --> 00:13:57.320]   I both have blind spots.
[00:13:57.320 --> 00:14:02.440]   And if we are called to be in a body, that means none of us can live in isolation, and
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:07.120]   that we cannot practice our Christianity individually.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:10.120]   That necessitates such concepts.
[00:14:10.120 --> 00:14:17.240]   And then if that is the case, if your pursuit of Christ is all-encompassing, why not follow
[00:14:17.240 --> 00:14:22.680]   the commands that is already laid out in scripture to seek accountability?
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:28.080]   Aren't there things in your life that you don't see that other people see?
[00:14:28.080 --> 00:14:33.120]   There are things in my life that I do not see that other people see.
[00:14:33.120 --> 00:14:38.080]   Maybe there are things in your life that you don't see, but you don't understand the severity.
[00:14:38.080 --> 00:14:40.460]   Let me say one other point about accountability.
[00:14:40.460 --> 00:14:46.160]   If you are in an accountability group already, I really hope that it's centered on the word.
[00:14:46.160 --> 00:14:49.960]   I really hope that it is centered on the word.
[00:14:49.960 --> 00:14:53.800]   Not a, "You're good, and I'm good, it's like the blind leading the blind, we're all good,
[00:14:53.800 --> 00:14:54.800]   and everything's fine."
[00:14:54.800 --> 00:15:03.840]   But a pursuit of Christ using the very lamp of God, which is his word.
[00:15:03.840 --> 00:15:09.880]   Because if we are in darkness, if we are in darkness, which the Bible says we are, and
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:16.440]   if the word of God is a lamp, then what else would you use to guide whether or not your
[00:15:16.440 --> 00:15:21.520]   pursuits, your value system, the things you spend your time and money on, all those things
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:24.240]   are actually in accord with Christ.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:27.280]   Is it gonna be the blind man next to you?
[00:15:27.280 --> 00:15:31.640]   Or is it going to be the actual word of God?
[00:15:31.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   Let me go further here.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:37.920]   James chapter three, verse two, says that we all stumble in many ways.
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:40.040]   We all stumble in many ways.
[00:15:40.040 --> 00:15:45.160]   Second Corinthians 5.10 says this, that we must all appear before the judgment seat of
[00:15:45.160 --> 00:15:46.160]   Christ.
[00:15:46.160 --> 00:15:52.680]   If we all stumble in many ways, and we will all appear before the judgment seat of Christ,
[00:15:52.680 --> 00:15:54.840]   then why accountability?
[00:15:54.840 --> 00:15:57.760]   Then why accountability?
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:00.400]   Or maybe you think you can do it on your own.
[00:16:00.400 --> 00:16:08.880]   And I've gotta tell you, if you do think that, you stand in contradiction to scripture.
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:15.800]   So let's keep each other accountable with our intake of the word, with our prayer life,
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:19.600]   where we spend our time, the things that we value.
[00:16:19.600 --> 00:16:25.720]   Let's keep each other accountable, because we cannot see clearly all the time.
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:31.720]   And when we do so, let's hold it up to the measure of the word.
[00:16:31.720 --> 00:16:34.160]   Now the word of God is a double-edged sword.
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:39.040]   And I gotta tell you, as I'm saying this to you, it's cutting me.
[00:16:39.040 --> 00:16:41.800]   It's cutting me.
[00:16:41.800 --> 00:16:48.960]   And it is clear from scripture that it doesn't matter how long you've been a Christian for.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:49.960]   Okay?
[00:16:49.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   It doesn't matter.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:53.280]   I've been a Christian for 20 years.
[00:16:53.280 --> 00:16:54.280]   I don't need accountability.
[00:16:54.280 --> 00:16:57.600]   Now you never actually say that, but you think it, right?
[00:16:57.600 --> 00:16:59.600]   It doesn't matter how long you've been a Berean for.
[00:16:59.600 --> 00:17:01.320]   It doesn't matter if you're a small group leader.
[00:17:01.320 --> 00:17:04.400]   It certainly doesn't matter if you're an elder.
[00:17:04.400 --> 00:17:05.400]   That doesn't matter.
[00:17:05.400 --> 00:17:07.560]   Acts 10.34 says this.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:14.520]   I most certainly understand now that God is not one to show partiality.
[00:17:14.520 --> 00:17:16.600]   I love the King James Version.
[00:17:16.600 --> 00:17:21.240]   God is no respecter of persons.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:27.720]   I don't think it's gonna go well for me if I appear before Christ and I tell him that
[00:17:27.720 --> 00:17:33.280]   I didn't really think I needed accountability because I was voted by men as an elder.
[00:17:33.280 --> 00:17:36.680]   So I just felt like it wasn't really necessary.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:37.880]   I don't know.
[00:17:37.880 --> 00:17:42.120]   That might not work, right?
[00:17:42.120 --> 00:17:47.960]   As we think about this BCC covenant point, and as you think about accountability, think
[00:17:47.960 --> 00:17:51.600]   very soberly about what is reality.
[00:17:51.600 --> 00:17:56.520]   And as you consider what reality is, don't look to your own understanding of what reality
[00:17:56.520 --> 00:17:59.080]   is because that's how sublime sin is.
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:00.600]   That's how subtle it is.
[00:18:00.600 --> 00:18:02.520]   That's how powerful it is.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:04.480]   And that's how deceptive it is.
[00:18:04.480 --> 00:18:11.160]   Look to what the Word of God says as to what reality is, and then make a decision as to
[00:18:11.160 --> 00:18:15.640]   whatever choice you make in life, especially as it relates to accountability.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:22.600]   So if you are mired in sin, if you are mired in sin, consider getting accountability.
[00:18:22.600 --> 00:18:27.960]   If you are in a place where you clearly know that your accountability group is not running
[00:18:27.960 --> 00:18:33.200]   on the wheels of scripture, consider getting out.
[00:18:33.200 --> 00:18:40.560]   And in all things, are you moving towards the upward call of God in Christ Jesus?
[00:18:40.560 --> 00:18:42.760]   Point number two.
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:47.160]   Point number two, submission to elders.
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:48.160]   Submission to elders.
[00:18:48.160 --> 00:18:55.440]   Now, I'm smiling here because I'm an elder, right?
[00:18:55.440 --> 00:19:03.120]   And anything I say at this point, it could come off self-aggrandizing, self-rewarding,
[00:19:03.120 --> 00:19:08.960]   pompous, maybe even shameless, right?
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:16.320]   Because what I'm about to tell you could be taken as, "Submit to me."
[00:19:16.320 --> 00:19:19.880]   And as I was preparing this portion of the sermon, I thought to myself, "Man, this is
[00:19:19.880 --> 00:19:22.920]   going to go over well, right?"
[00:19:22.920 --> 00:19:30.160]   But in the spirit of 2 Corinthians 11, 1, in the spirit of 2 Corinthians 11, 1, I wish
[00:19:30.160 --> 00:19:34.360]   that you would bear with me in a little foolishness, but indeed you are bearing with me.
[00:19:34.360 --> 00:19:37.980]   I hope you would bear with me in a little foolishness.
[00:19:37.980 --> 00:19:39.780]   Just bear with me a little bit.
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:45.640]   Because what I'm going to give you at this point is not what I say, but what the Word
[00:19:45.640 --> 00:19:46.960]   of God says.
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:49.560]   So let's get to those verses right now.
[00:19:49.560 --> 00:19:56.160]   1 Corinthians 16, 15 to 16 says this, "Now I urge you, brethren, you know the household
[00:19:56.160 --> 00:20:00.280]   of Stephanas, that they were the first roots of Achaia, and that they have devoted themselves
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:04.720]   for ministry to the saints, that you also be in subjection to such men, and to everyone
[00:20:04.720 --> 00:20:07.000]   who helps in the work and labors."
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:12.240]   1 Thessalonians 5, 11 through 12 says this, "But we request of you, brethren, that you
[00:20:12.240 --> 00:20:16.440]   appreciate those who diligently labor among you, and have charge over you in the Lord,
[00:20:16.440 --> 00:20:21.320]   and give you instruction, and that you esteem them very highly in love because of their
[00:20:21.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   work.
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:23.720]   Live in peace with one another."
[00:20:23.720 --> 00:20:29.800]   1 Peter 5, 5 says this, "You younger men likewise, be subject to your elders, and all
[00:20:29.800 --> 00:20:32.760]   of you clothe yourselves with humility toward one another.
[00:20:32.760 --> 00:20:37.680]   For God is opposed to the proud, but gives grace to the humble."
[00:20:37.680 --> 00:20:43.720]   Hebrews 13, 17 says this, "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over
[00:20:43.720 --> 00:20:46.000]   your souls as those who will give an account."
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:52.680]   Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you.
[00:20:52.680 --> 00:20:58.640]   A note on Hebrews 13 with respect to the Greek words obey and submit.
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:05.600]   The word for obey that's used here in Hebrews 13 and 17 is the same word that's used in
[00:21:05.600 --> 00:21:09.480]   relation to Jesus trusting in God in Matthew 27, 43.
[00:21:09.480 --> 00:21:12.320]   It's the same exact word here.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:13.640]   Let me give you some definitions.
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:19.520]   They would include, but are not limited to, to be assured of, to have confidence in, to
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:26.280]   be convinced of, to be persuaded, to trust, and to be induced by one's word to believe
[00:21:26.280 --> 00:21:30.360]   absolutely.
[00:21:30.360 --> 00:21:33.720]   I didn't get this from an elders dictionary.
[00:21:33.720 --> 00:21:36.800]   I got this from a Greek dictionary.
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:39.060]   Please look it up yourself.
[00:21:39.060 --> 00:21:44.120]   This is from Strong's Concordance dictionary.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:49.080]   The word for submit means to yield and to surrender.
[00:21:49.080 --> 00:21:52.920]   The word for submit here means to yield and surrender.
[00:21:52.920 --> 00:22:00.400]   So in Hebrews 13 and 17 it says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them."
[00:22:00.400 --> 00:22:04.520]   Now let me say that again, okay?
[00:22:04.520 --> 00:22:06.840]   That's what the word of God says.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.320]   I didn't say it.
[00:22:08.320 --> 00:22:09.600]   That's what the word of God says.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:14.860]   First Corinthians 16, First Thessalonians 5, First Peter 5, Hebrews 13.
[00:22:14.860 --> 00:22:17.280]   That is from the word of God.
[00:22:17.280 --> 00:22:19.560]   But let me address the elephant in the room for a minute, okay?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:22.220]   Let me address this for a second.
[00:22:22.220 --> 00:22:27.580]   When you and I hear the word submission, when you and I hear the word submission, it's kind
[00:22:27.580 --> 00:22:31.920]   of a dirty word because it comes with a lot of cultural baggage.
[00:22:31.920 --> 00:22:35.720]   Now a lot of it is reasonable, okay?
[00:22:35.720 --> 00:22:37.980]   And I feel the same exact way.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.000]   You know what words I love?
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.240]   I love independence.
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:43.360]   I love independence.
[00:22:43.360 --> 00:22:44.960]   I love July 4th, right?
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.080]   I love what it represents and what it stands for.
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.720]   I love independence.
[00:22:48.720 --> 00:22:50.680]   You know what other word I love?
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:51.680]   Autonomy.
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:53.880]   Yes, I love autonomy.
[00:22:53.880 --> 00:22:57.440]   Let me do what I want, right?
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:00.360]   You know what word I very much dislike?
[00:23:00.360 --> 00:23:01.360]   Supervision.
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:02.360]   Supervision.
[00:23:02.360 --> 00:23:05.360]   I'm like, "Ugh, supervision."
[00:23:05.360 --> 00:23:06.360]   Right?
[00:23:06.360 --> 00:23:09.480]   Oh, you and I dislike supervision.
[00:23:09.480 --> 00:23:12.720]   But you know what word we dislike even more than supervision?
[00:23:12.720 --> 00:23:13.720]   Submission.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:14.720]   Submission.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:21.720]   When you go to a wedding and you hear vows and you hear the word submission, you know
[00:23:21.720 --> 00:23:22.720]   it's a Christian wedding, right?
[00:23:22.720 --> 00:23:28.920]   Ain't no one going to say that word unless they're believers in the Bible.
[00:23:28.920 --> 00:23:32.120]   In this culture, forget about it, right?
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:35.480]   You are a chauvinist and you are a Neanderthal.
[00:23:35.480 --> 00:23:43.680]   So unless you have complete loyalty to the word of God, that word submission is not happening.
[00:23:43.680 --> 00:23:48.880]   And even when you have submission to the word of God, that word might not be used even then
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:51.200]   in a wedding ceremony, right?
[00:23:51.200 --> 00:23:54.520]   So there's a lot of cultural baggage that comes with that.
[00:23:54.520 --> 00:23:57.040]   The reasonable part is this, okay?
[00:23:57.040 --> 00:24:01.080]   If you and I were to wake up next morning, we turn on the news and we hear of a corrupt
[00:24:01.080 --> 00:24:05.080]   politician, no one's going to be surprised.
[00:24:05.080 --> 00:24:09.680]   No one's going to be like, "Oh, I never heard of such a thing.
[00:24:09.680 --> 00:24:10.680]   Someone abused their power."
[00:24:10.680 --> 00:24:12.880]   Not going to be surprised.
[00:24:12.880 --> 00:24:17.280]   You hear of a corrupt religious leader, no one's going to be like, "There's a corrupt
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:19.800]   religious leader somewhere."
[00:24:19.800 --> 00:24:21.000]   Nobody's going to be surprised.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:25.280]   In fact, we are inundated with that, right?
[00:24:25.280 --> 00:24:30.560]   When you hear a story of a politician with integrity, you're like, "Wow, that's like
[00:24:30.560 --> 00:24:32.400]   the anomaly," right?
[00:24:32.400 --> 00:24:40.640]   And so that word is connected with submission because submission is connected with leadership
[00:24:40.640 --> 00:24:41.880]   and power.
[00:24:41.880 --> 00:24:47.160]   And if those two things are corrupted, why in the world would I submit?
[00:24:47.160 --> 00:24:48.880]   But it goes even deeper than that.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:52.520]   Oh yes, it goes even deeper.
[00:24:52.520 --> 00:25:01.280]   Even within the church context, the context of a true church, there are many people who
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:07.360]   would love to occupy the place of spiritual blessing.
[00:25:07.360 --> 00:25:12.040]   It is not enough that you see God glorified.
[00:25:12.040 --> 00:25:13.800]   No, no.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:18.520]   You want God to use you to glorify himself.
[00:25:18.520 --> 00:25:21.640]   It's not enough for you to stand back and see God working.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:30.160]   You need to be used by God or else God is not glorified.
[00:25:30.160 --> 00:25:32.680]   Even within the context of the church, it seeps in.
[00:25:32.680 --> 00:25:37.040]   I am not saying anything novel here.
[00:25:37.040 --> 00:25:39.160]   We're all kind of there, right?
[00:25:39.160 --> 00:25:42.280]   We've all tasted it to a certain degree.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:44.360]   So all of this is in our head.
[00:25:44.360 --> 00:25:50.280]   This is the context and all of a sudden you hear the word "submission."
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:54.400]   I'm very aware of that context, okay?
[00:25:54.400 --> 00:25:58.480]   But let me point, let me paint something else for you, okay?
[00:25:58.480 --> 00:26:00.160]   Sin is around now.
[00:26:00.160 --> 00:26:03.720]   That's why people are corrupt now in government, in religion.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.800]   That's why people are corrupt now, okay?
[00:26:06.800 --> 00:26:12.480]   Sin was also around when 1 Corinthians 16 was written, when 1 Thessalonians 5 was written,
[00:26:12.480 --> 00:26:14.400]   when 1 Peter 5 was written.
[00:26:14.400 --> 00:26:20.040]   When Hebrews 13 was written, sin was still around.
[00:26:20.040 --> 00:26:22.360]   Corrupt governments were around.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:24.380]   Corrupt religious leaders were around.
[00:26:24.380 --> 00:26:25.760]   They had seen corrupt governments.
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:27.840]   They had seen corrupt politicians.
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:31.200]   And you know what else?
[00:26:31.200 --> 00:26:33.200]   This is going to be a tough pill to swallow, okay?
[00:26:33.200 --> 00:26:35.200]   So hold on, okay?
[00:26:35.200 --> 00:26:36.560]   Hold on.
[00:26:36.560 --> 00:26:43.800]   God mediates much of his rule through people.
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.460]   God mediates much of his rule through people.
[00:26:50.460 --> 00:26:53.040]   You and I don't wake up.
[00:26:53.040 --> 00:26:56.640]   God imparts the clouds and says, "James, this is what you're going to do today.
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:26:57.720]   This is what you're going to say.
[00:26:57.720 --> 00:27:00.560]   You get together with this person and this is what you do."
[00:27:00.560 --> 00:27:04.120]   And I meet that person and that person says, "Yeah, God imparted the clouds this morning
[00:27:04.120 --> 00:27:05.880]   and he told me X, Y, and Z."
[00:27:05.880 --> 00:27:07.440]   "Oh yeah, he told me the same thing."
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:08.440]   "That's great.
[00:27:08.440 --> 00:27:09.440]   I follow God and not man."
[00:27:09.440 --> 00:27:10.440]   Right?
[00:27:10.440 --> 00:27:11.440]   "That's great."
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:13.360]   That would be awesome.
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:15.840]   That would be awesome.
[00:27:15.840 --> 00:27:18.720]   But it doesn't work that way.
[00:27:18.720 --> 00:27:26.880]   God deliberately and intentionally chooses to mediate much of his rule through people,
[00:27:26.880 --> 00:27:30.800]   which is why it says what it says right here.
[00:27:30.800 --> 00:27:36.200]   It says these verses right here because that is the case.
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:39.680]   Let me go even deeper than that.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:48.200]   If you don't have a submissive attitude towards your leaders, if you don't have that, it is
[00:27:48.200 --> 00:27:55.940]   indicative of your spiritual maturity or lack thereof.
[00:27:55.940 --> 00:28:02.760]   It is more reminiscent, more indicative of your spiritual immaturity.
[00:28:02.760 --> 00:28:04.160]   Why?
[00:28:04.160 --> 00:28:08.320]   A couple reasons why.
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:11.360]   You are enamored with your own ideas.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:15.120]   Your own ideas seem grandiose to you.
[00:28:15.120 --> 00:28:20.360]   And when you are confronted with the fact that there is an apparent deficiency in a
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:26.420]   holistic knowledge of the scriptures, it still doesn't change your mind.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:34.460]   Moreover, moreover, Hebrews 13, 17 says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them."
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:39.780]   If it says, "Obey your leaders and submit to them," how can you be a mature Christian
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:43.700]   and in violation of God's commandment?
[00:28:43.700 --> 00:28:46.040]   How does that work?
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:49.960]   You're a mature Christian, but you're in violation of God's commandment.
[00:28:49.960 --> 00:28:53.240]   Maybe you lack a belief in the sovereignty of God.
[00:28:53.240 --> 00:28:55.360]   Did you consider that?
[00:28:55.360 --> 00:29:02.820]   Maybe you lack faith in the way God has designed the institution of the church.
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.020]   Maybe you lack faith in that.
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:08.460]   Because what I've quoted to you is God's word.
[00:29:08.460 --> 00:29:12.500]   I'm not the one that said, "Obey your leaders and submit to them."
[00:29:12.500 --> 00:29:15.620]   I'm not the one that instituted elders.
[00:29:15.620 --> 00:29:18.980]   God has ordained it in that way.
[00:29:18.980 --> 00:29:25.840]   So if you don't have a submissive attitude, a logical conclusion to that is that maybe
[00:29:25.840 --> 00:29:30.140]   you don't have faith in the word of God.
[00:29:30.140 --> 00:29:33.620]   Maybe you don't have faith in the word of God.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:38.740]   Maybe you don't have a complete understanding of the scriptures.
[00:29:38.740 --> 00:29:43.020]   Now I want to put in a plug right here, okay?
[00:29:43.020 --> 00:29:48.100]   Because what I said right now, it is severe and it is cutting.
[00:29:48.100 --> 00:29:53.740]   It is true, but it also cutting and severe.
[00:29:53.740 --> 00:29:57.060]   I want to pull this plug in right now so everyone in here hears it.
[00:29:57.060 --> 00:29:59.920]   This is a personal policy of mine.
[00:29:59.920 --> 00:30:06.220]   If you have a question about anything, is that word exhaustive enough?
[00:30:06.220 --> 00:30:07.580]   Anything, right?
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:12.460]   If you have a question about anything, come and ask me.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:15.460]   Just come and ask me.
[00:30:15.460 --> 00:30:18.540]   There's no reason why you should be in the dark.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:21.220]   I don't know what I don't know.
[00:30:21.220 --> 00:30:24.300]   I don't know if you have questions about something.
[00:30:24.300 --> 00:30:28.260]   But if you have a question about something, feel free to come and ask.
[00:30:28.260 --> 00:30:30.700]   Why am I putting this plug here?
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.420]   I understand how difficult it is to submit.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:36.500]   I understand that.
[00:30:36.500 --> 00:30:40.100]   It's not like I became an elder and I forgot, okay?
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.700]   Submission in any context is extremely difficult.
[00:30:43.700 --> 00:30:44.700]   Why?
[00:30:44.700 --> 00:30:46.780]   Think about your relationship with God.
[00:30:46.780 --> 00:30:51.740]   You submit to God, not all the time, but you ultimately submit to God because you know
[00:30:51.740 --> 00:30:53.100]   He's good.
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:57.100]   And because you know He's good, that helps you to submit, right?
[00:30:57.100 --> 00:31:03.300]   My point is, a lot of times, if you know the why, it'll help with submission.
[00:31:03.300 --> 00:31:09.880]   And I want to do everything humanly possible to make this portion of Christian life easy
[00:31:09.880 --> 00:31:12.180]   breezy for you.
[00:31:12.180 --> 00:31:16.060]   I don't want to speak truth to you and just say, "Good luck with it."
[00:31:16.060 --> 00:31:17.380]   I don't want to do that.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.580]   At the same time, I need to speak the truth.
[00:31:20.580 --> 00:31:21.580]   The truth is there.
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.540]   It's going to make me look a certain way.
[00:31:23.540 --> 00:31:26.060]   Regardless, I still need to speak it.
[00:31:26.060 --> 00:31:30.260]   And I still need to speak what reality actually is.
[00:31:30.260 --> 00:31:38.500]   But I can do what is humanly possible to make this commandment as easy for you as possible.
[00:31:38.500 --> 00:31:43.980]   I think a lot of times, if you know the why, if you just know the why, "Why did we decide
[00:31:43.980 --> 00:31:44.980]   this?
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:45.980]   Oh, okay.
[00:31:45.980 --> 00:31:46.980]   Okay.
[00:31:46.980 --> 00:31:47.980]   Oh, why did we decide this?
[00:31:47.980 --> 00:31:48.980]   Well, this is the reason why.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:49.980]   Oh, oh, oh.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:52.020]   You might disagree, but you see that thought was put into it.
[00:31:52.020 --> 00:31:53.020]   Prayer was put into it.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:54.020]   Oh, okay.
[00:31:54.020 --> 00:31:56.780]   I don't necessarily agree, but okay.
[00:31:56.780 --> 00:31:57.780]   Okay."
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:32:03.060]   There is no need for anyone to be just hiding in the back.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:07.220]   There's absolutely no need for that when I've given you an open invitation.
[00:32:07.220 --> 00:32:11.340]   And if anyone is not here, I said the same exact thing at first service.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:14.620]   If anyone is not here, this is an open invitation to the entire church.
[00:32:14.620 --> 00:32:18.420]   You want to ask me about something, feel free to come and ask me.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:24.100]   If it's one person, if it's five people, if it's 10 people, if 20, whatever it is, we
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:25.100]   can meet somewhere.
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:27.220]   20 of you want to gather together, I'll go there by myself.
[00:32:27.220 --> 00:32:29.300]   I'll answer your questions.
[00:32:29.300 --> 00:32:33.180]   I want to make this as easy as possible for you.
[00:32:33.180 --> 00:32:36.620]   Now, there are some things I might not be able to, like if you ask me, "Well, what does
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:37.620]   that person's secret?"
[00:32:37.620 --> 00:32:38.620]   I mean, like, come on.
[00:32:38.620 --> 00:32:39.620]   Right?
[00:32:39.620 --> 00:32:40.620]   I mean, right?
[00:32:40.620 --> 00:32:43.540]   Can't do that, right?
[00:32:43.540 --> 00:32:46.660]   But if it's something that I can help you with, with respect to submission, because
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:51.460]   I know how hard it is, it's not like I don't, I still have to exercise submission, obviously,
[00:32:51.460 --> 00:32:53.580]   in many, many different places.
[00:32:53.580 --> 00:32:57.820]   But maybe if you know the why, it'll help.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:06.180]   That is my personal plug to you, knowing that this commandment is difficult.
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:12.060]   I want to cover one other rather ugly point as it relates to submission to elders, because
[00:33:12.060 --> 00:33:16.900]   it kind of gives a glimpse as to why it's important and what the elder must do.
[00:33:16.900 --> 00:33:21.140]   But before I do that, I want to read to you two verses.
[00:33:21.140 --> 00:33:25.940]   Second Timothy 2, 14 to 17, and Philippians 2, 14.
[00:33:25.940 --> 00:33:29.100]   Let me read Second Timothy 2, 14 to 17 to you.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:33.620]   It says this, "Remind them of these things and solemnly charge them in the presence of
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.940]   God, not to wrangle about words which is useless and leads to the ruin of the hearers.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:43.840]   Be diligent to present yourself approved to God as a workman who does not need to be accurately
[00:33:43.840 --> 00:33:49.760]   handling the word of truth, but avoid worldly and empty chatter, for it will lead to further
[00:33:49.760 --> 00:33:55.860]   ungodliness and their talk will spread like gangrene."
[00:33:55.860 --> 00:34:04.180]   Philippians 2, 14 says this, "Do all things without grumbling or disputing."
[00:34:04.180 --> 00:34:11.300]   Part of an elder's job, and perhaps why the scriptures call us to submission, is that
[00:34:11.300 --> 00:34:13.580]   the elders have to deal with this.
[00:34:13.580 --> 00:34:17.380]   Now let me be clear about something.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:21.900]   Every Christian is called to confront and rebuke sin.
[00:34:21.900 --> 00:34:23.480]   Make no mistake about it.
[00:34:23.480 --> 00:34:25.540]   Every single Christian.
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:30.940]   There is no job within scripture that is pertaining only to an elder and not to a Christian.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:34.180]   You see sin and you don't rebuke it?
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:35.900]   And you think that will fly with Christ?
[00:34:35.900 --> 00:34:37.060]   Doesn't work that way.
[00:34:37.060 --> 00:34:40.220]   So it is every Christian's job.
[00:34:40.220 --> 00:34:45.100]   But, the buck needs to stop with the elders.
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:49.860]   The buck needs to stop with the elders.
[00:34:49.860 --> 00:34:53.540]   If there were a person in here, he became a member, right?
[00:34:53.540 --> 00:34:56.260]   And I'm giving an incredibly facetious example.
[00:34:56.260 --> 00:34:57.980]   He decided to become a serial killer.
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:34:58.980]   Right?
[00:34:58.980 --> 00:35:01.380]   And he just goes and he kills three people, right?
[00:35:01.380 --> 00:35:03.140]   And we say, "We rebuke that guy."
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:04.900]   Because he's like, "No, I think it's okay to kill people."
[00:35:04.900 --> 00:35:06.540]   We're like, "Oh, it's not okay to kill people."
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:08.380]   So we rebuke that guy, right?
[00:35:08.380 --> 00:35:12.180]   I don't think anyone in here would have a problem with that.
[00:35:12.180 --> 00:35:14.300]   Nobody in here would have a problem with that.
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:20.620]   Because the remedy is not disproportionate with what we're doing, with his conduct, excuse
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:21.620]   me.
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:25.020]   The remedy is not disproportionate with the remedy, okay?
[00:35:25.020 --> 00:35:32.540]   But when you engage in godless chatter, and you murmur, and you cause dissension, on a
[00:35:32.540 --> 00:35:40.100]   human level, on a human level, whenever that is dealt with, whenever that is dealt with,
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:42.580]   it looks disproportionate.
[00:35:42.580 --> 00:35:44.580]   It looks disproportionate.
[00:35:44.580 --> 00:35:48.180]   That is how we view it in a human worldview.
[00:35:48.180 --> 00:35:49.180]   But what do the...
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.660]   I get that's the worldview.
[00:35:50.660 --> 00:35:53.100]   But what do the scriptures say?
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:55.020]   What do the scriptures say?
[00:35:55.020 --> 00:35:57.900]   It leads to the ruin of the hearers.
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:36:01.020]   Their talk will spread like gangrene.
[00:36:01.020 --> 00:36:04.900]   Philippians 2.14, "Do all things without grumbling or disputing."
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:10.340]   So even though you might think it's not a big deal, the scriptures stand in contradiction
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:14.100]   to what you believe reality actually is.
[00:36:14.100 --> 00:36:19.460]   And if you think about it for a second, because everyone else thinks it's no big deal, because
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:25.500]   everybody else thinks it's no big deal, that's the reason why it could spread.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:30.580]   Serial killing is not going to spread, because nobody thinks it's a big deal.
[00:36:30.580 --> 00:36:34.940]   But that murmuring that's kind of innocent and not innocent, oh, that can spread, and
[00:36:34.940 --> 00:36:36.980]   that can divide.
[00:36:36.980 --> 00:36:41.060]   And be careful that you divide the body of Christ.
[00:36:41.060 --> 00:36:45.300]   Every Christian is called to confront that.
[00:36:45.300 --> 00:36:48.860]   But it stops with the elders.
[00:36:48.860 --> 00:36:50.100]   We should stop with the elders.
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:51.980]   That is our job.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:53.660]   That is unenviable, isn't it?
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:57.180]   It is extremely unenviable.
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.340]   I want to say something else here.
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:07.500]   I don't want anyone to get the idea that there's some implication that I don't like it when
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:09.940]   you ask questions.
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:11.700]   I just got through.
[00:37:11.700 --> 00:37:13.420]   Don't distort what I'm saying.
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:16.220]   I'm telling you what scripture says.
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:19.300]   Don't make an implication that says, "Well, I guess he doesn't like it when questions
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:20.300]   are asked."
[00:37:20.300 --> 00:37:21.620]   That is not the case.
[00:37:21.620 --> 00:37:24.220]   I just said, "Ask me any question anytime you want."
[00:37:24.220 --> 00:37:28.980]   But what do the scriptures say?
[00:37:28.980 --> 00:37:30.940]   What do the scriptures say?
[00:37:30.940 --> 00:37:33.920]   It will lead to the ruin of hearers.
[00:37:33.920 --> 00:37:37.580]   Their talk will spread like gangrene.
[00:37:37.580 --> 00:37:39.820]   Every Christian is called to confront it.
[00:37:39.820 --> 00:37:46.100]   But at the very least, the elders must deal with it.
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:51.300]   That is a difficult job, and perhaps that's why the commands to submit to elders in part
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.580]   is given.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:55.420]   Point number three.
[00:37:55.420 --> 00:37:57.540]   Point number three.
[00:37:57.540 --> 00:38:01.380]   The example, the reason, and the goal.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:03.780]   The example, the reason, and the goal.
[00:38:03.780 --> 00:38:06.740]   I'm pretty sure you know who I'm talking about when I say the example, the reason, and the
[00:38:06.740 --> 00:38:09.100]   goal.
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.720]   I'm going to connect point number one to this point, and I'm going to connect point number
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.700]   two with this point.
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:17.940]   Matthew 21, 12 to 17.
[00:38:17.940 --> 00:38:19.900]   Mark 11, 15 to 18.
[00:38:19.900 --> 00:38:22.860]   Luke 19, 45 through 48.
[00:38:22.860 --> 00:38:24.740]   All describing the same event.
[00:38:24.740 --> 00:38:27.340]   Let me read to you Mark 11, 15 to 18.
[00:38:27.340 --> 00:38:32.460]   "Then they came to Jerusalem, and he entered the temple and began to drive out those who
[00:38:32.460 --> 00:38:36.380]   were buying and selling in the temple, and overturned the temples of the money changers
[00:38:36.380 --> 00:38:38.820]   and the seats of those who were selling doves.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:42.320]   And he would not permit anyone to carry merchandise through the temple.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.220]   And he began to teach and say to them, 'Is it not written, my house shall be called a
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:50.140]   house of prayer for all the nations, but you have made it a robbers den.'
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.500]   The chief priests and the scribes heard this and began seeking how to destroy him, for
[00:38:54.500 --> 00:38:59.700]   they were afraid of him, for the whole crowd was astonished at his teaching."
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:03.140]   Accountability to what end?
[00:39:03.140 --> 00:39:06.820]   Submission to elders to what end?
[00:39:06.820 --> 00:39:07.820]   Accountability to what end?
[00:39:07.820 --> 00:39:09.700]   Let me ask you.
[00:39:09.700 --> 00:39:18.620]   In your accountability group, it's supposed to lead to Christ-likeness, right?
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:24.020]   It's supposed to lead to Christ-likeness.
[00:39:24.020 --> 00:39:29.320]   Does it lead to a Christ in the temple?
[00:39:29.320 --> 00:39:31.820]   Does it lead you to a Christ in the temple?
[00:39:31.820 --> 00:39:35.680]   Everybody wants to be Christ the Lamb.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:41.200]   Everybody wants to be the John 9 Christ, where he says to the blind man, "Go wash," and he
[00:39:41.200 --> 00:39:42.420]   can see.
[00:39:42.420 --> 00:39:43.940]   Everybody wants to be that Christ.
[00:39:43.940 --> 00:39:49.500]   And inwardly, everybody wants to be the Christ that's shouted, "Hosanna, Hosanna."
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:53.180]   So you have a picture of who Christ is, don't you?
[00:39:53.180 --> 00:39:58.260]   You have a picture, and you take parts from the Bible, but the whole counsel of God must
[00:39:58.260 --> 00:39:59.460]   be taught.
[00:39:59.460 --> 00:40:07.940]   And if Christ-likeness is the goal in your accountability group, do you remember Christ
[00:40:07.940 --> 00:40:10.280]   in the temple?
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:16.100]   When you hear this passage, do you feel a kinship with Christ?
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:22.300]   Or is it so far from your spiritual vocabulary that you wouldn't ever dream of doing such
[00:40:22.300 --> 00:40:24.600]   a thing?
[00:40:24.600 --> 00:40:33.280]   Remember Christ, the zeal of God so consumed him that he is okay with being misunderstood.
[00:40:33.280 --> 00:40:36.800]   He is okay with having his reputation destroyed.
[00:40:36.800 --> 00:40:40.560]   He is okay being caricatured.
[00:40:40.560 --> 00:40:45.840]   He is okay with that because of the joy set before him.
[00:40:45.840 --> 00:40:52.760]   Christ in the temple, he is looking at those he would later save through his blood, and
[00:40:52.760 --> 00:40:58.120]   those people are the ones putting him to the cross.
[00:40:58.120 --> 00:41:01.000]   They don't understand what he is doing.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:07.160]   If you and I were alive during this time and we witnessed this event, what would you and
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.640]   I think?
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:11.080]   "Oh, I get what he's doing.
[00:41:11.080 --> 00:41:13.800]   I get what Jesus is doing, but I would have done it more wisely."
[00:41:13.800 --> 00:41:24.400]   Or, "I get what Jesus is doing, but I would have been more loving."
[00:41:24.400 --> 00:41:27.680]   You see the irony of that, right?
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:29.960]   Because Christ is love.
[00:41:29.960 --> 00:41:31.800]   Christ has no sin.
[00:41:31.800 --> 00:41:35.680]   He didn't just lose control.
[00:41:35.680 --> 00:41:37.840]   This is actually his second time cleansing the temple.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:42.760]   At least, his second time cleansing the temple.
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:49.840]   At the very same time, does your accountability group lead you, and does it include a picture
[00:41:49.840 --> 00:41:52.040]   of Christ in the temple?
[00:41:52.040 --> 00:41:55.680]   Paul says it in a different way, capturing the same concept.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   Philippians 3, 7-11 says this, "But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:02.880]   counted as loss for the sake of Christ.
[00:42:02.880 --> 00:42:06.960]   More than that, I count all things to be loss in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:10.880]   Christ Jesus my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them but
[00:42:10.880 --> 00:42:14.640]   rubbish, so that I may gain Christ, and may be found in him.
[00:42:14.640 --> 00:42:18.400]   Not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith
[00:42:18.400 --> 00:42:22.840]   in Christ, the righteousness which comes from God on the basis of faith, that I may know
[00:42:22.840 --> 00:42:30.320]   him and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings being conformed
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:35.760]   to his death, in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
[00:42:35.760 --> 00:42:43.000]   If Paul had it his way, he would have been transported with Christ in the temple.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:46.600]   Do not forget that picture.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:53.480]   There's another way that Christ in the temple connects with accountability.
[00:42:53.480 --> 00:42:57.920]   The temple is a place where Jews came, or proselytes, Jewish proselytes came to meet
[00:42:57.920 --> 00:42:59.520]   God, right?
[00:42:59.520 --> 00:43:03.160]   The temple is where you come to meet Yahweh.
[00:43:03.160 --> 00:43:10.320]   Where you give your devotion, where you give your time and your sacrifice to Yahweh, right?
[00:43:10.320 --> 00:43:11.320]   Okay.
[00:43:11.320 --> 00:43:15.320]   Jesus cleansed that, okay?
[00:43:15.320 --> 00:43:21.360]   Post-Pentecost, meaning today, where is the temple of God now?
[00:43:21.360 --> 00:43:25.040]   Where is the temple of God now?
[00:43:25.040 --> 00:43:31.600]   First Corinthians 6, 19-20 says this, "Or do you not know that your body is a temple
[00:43:31.600 --> 00:43:36.520]   of the Holy Spirit who is in you, whom you have from God, and that you are not your own?
[00:43:36.520 --> 00:43:39.040]   For you have been bought with a price.
[00:43:39.040 --> 00:43:43.120]   Therefore glorify God in your body."
[00:43:43.120 --> 00:43:48.360]   Therefore glorify God in your body.
[00:43:48.360 --> 00:43:56.400]   In your accountability group, will you allow Christ to cleanse the temple?
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:44:01.880]   And let it be one, as you're good, I'm good, and everything's good, right?
[00:44:01.880 --> 00:44:05.760]   Let it be centered on the very Word of God.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:09.280]   And let Christ cleanse the temple.
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:15.320]   Because we are the temple of the Holy Spirit that is in us.
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:19.280]   That's John 15.
[00:44:19.280 --> 00:44:20.840]   Submission to elders.
[00:44:20.840 --> 00:44:22.940]   To what end?
[00:44:22.940 --> 00:44:26.520]   Submission to elders, to what end?
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:32.320]   In order for me to illustrate this point, it's gonna be helpful to know what an elder
[00:44:32.320 --> 00:44:35.560]   must be and what an elder must do.
[00:44:35.560 --> 00:44:39.200]   Okay, it's gonna make a lot more sense, so I'm gonna go through that first.
[00:44:39.200 --> 00:44:45.680]   And this is, these are in Titus 1.5-9, 1 Timothy 3.1-7, and 1 Peter 5.1-4.
[00:44:45.680 --> 00:44:48.360]   It's not exhaustive, it's not exhaustive, right?
[00:44:48.360 --> 00:44:49.840]   But a lot of it comes from there.
[00:44:49.840 --> 00:44:52.580]   Now, I have a list here, I'm gonna read it to you.
[00:44:52.580 --> 00:44:55.080]   These are the things an elder must be.
[00:44:55.080 --> 00:45:03.760]   Above reproach, temperate, prudent, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not addicted to
[00:45:03.760 --> 00:45:10.480]   wine or quarrelsome, gentle, peaceable, free from the love of money, manage their own household
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:11.480]   well.
[00:45:11.480 --> 00:45:16.000]   I don't know who this describes, it certainly doesn't describe me, right?
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:17.640]   Let's consider what elders must do.
[00:45:17.640 --> 00:45:18.640]   We don't stop there.
[00:45:18.640 --> 00:45:20.600]   Let's consider what elders must do.
[00:45:20.600 --> 00:45:25.160]   Be fast to word, exhort those with sound doctrine, refute those who contradict, shepherd the
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:29.760]   flock without compulsion, be an example, mete out the administration of the church, pray
[00:45:29.760 --> 00:45:36.780]   for all, deal with divisiveness, determine and enforce discipline.
[00:45:36.780 --> 00:45:44.940]   If you have any depth with respect to understanding what I said, this is all humanly impossible.
[00:45:44.940 --> 00:45:48.360]   It goes a little further in John 10, 11-15.
[00:45:48.360 --> 00:45:52.520]   In John 10, 11-15 it says this, "I am the good shepherd, the good shepherd lays down
[00:45:52.520 --> 00:45:54.000]   his life for the sheep.
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep, sees the
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.800]   wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees.
[00:46:00.800 --> 00:46:02.960]   And the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:07.120]   He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep.
[00:46:07.120 --> 00:46:10.960]   I am the good shepherd and I know my own and my own know me.
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:16.120]   Even as the father knows me and I know the father, I lay down my life for the sheep."
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:19.760]   Now I understand the context here, okay?
[00:46:19.760 --> 00:46:26.280]   But the principle here is right, every elder is an under-shepherd of Christ.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:32.000]   Elders are not bosses, they're stewards, they're deputy shepherds.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:39.520]   And just as every single Christian is called to mimic Christ, the elder better mimic Christ.
[00:46:39.520 --> 00:46:43.720]   So if you consider the list that I've just given to you with respect to what an elder
[00:46:43.720 --> 00:46:49.040]   must be, with respect to what an elder must do, on top of that you have the example of
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:54.760]   Christ in John 10, who does not flee when the wolf comes.
[00:46:54.760 --> 00:46:59.720]   And the reason that is difficult is because the wolf will come in sheep's clothing.
[00:46:59.720 --> 00:47:04.840]   And when the shepherd defends the sheep from the other wolf, the sheep are looking at you
[00:47:04.840 --> 00:47:10.880]   because the wolf is dressed in sheep's clothing, thinking, "What are you doing?
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:13.480]   What are you doing?"
[00:47:13.480 --> 00:47:15.840]   Because the wolf is dressed in sheep's clothing.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.920]   But the shepherd must continue to feed the sheep.
[00:47:20.920 --> 00:47:27.000]   And sometimes maybe the hand that feeds them might get bitten, but nonetheless the shepherd
[00:47:27.000 --> 00:47:30.760]   must continue to feed the sheep.
[00:47:30.760 --> 00:47:36.920]   All of these requirements taken in aggregate, the execution of what an elder must do is
[00:47:36.920 --> 00:47:39.400]   humanly impossible.
[00:47:39.400 --> 00:47:41.080]   It is humanly impossible.
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.040]   Let's go back to Christ in the temple.
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:47.520]   You see any apostles there?
[00:47:47.520 --> 00:47:49.640]   I don't see any apostles there.
[00:47:49.640 --> 00:47:51.360]   He's by himself.
[00:47:51.360 --> 00:47:56.400]   What about the throngs of people that shouted "Hosanna" to the King of David, the Son of
[00:47:56.400 --> 00:47:59.360]   David, the King of Israel?
[00:47:59.360 --> 00:48:01.120]   Where are they?
[00:48:01.120 --> 00:48:04.080]   I don't see anyone there.
[00:48:04.080 --> 00:48:13.440]   I see a lone man taking on the corrupt religious establishment, making sure that everyone has
[00:48:13.440 --> 00:48:16.720]   a chance to know the actual true way.
[00:48:16.720 --> 00:48:19.680]   I see Christ by himself.
[00:48:19.680 --> 00:48:22.720]   I see Christ by himself.
[00:48:22.720 --> 00:48:28.720]   It should not be news to you that at some point in your Christian life, in some circumstance,
[00:48:28.720 --> 00:48:33.760]   maybe God calls you to be by yourself.
[00:48:33.760 --> 00:48:41.440]   And as elders, and as elders, we visit this a lot because we are under-shepherds.
[00:48:41.440 --> 00:48:47.520]   We are deputy shepherds.
[00:48:47.520 --> 00:48:49.720]   They must hold the line.
[00:48:49.720 --> 00:48:58.040]   The requirements and the execution of what we have to do is humanly impossible.
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:07.200]   Knowing all that, knowing all that, will you submit to us?
[00:49:07.200 --> 00:49:10.800]   Will you submit to us?
[00:49:10.800 --> 00:49:12.800]   I know it's scary.
[00:49:12.800 --> 00:49:15.280]   It is risky.
[00:49:15.280 --> 00:49:19.040]   Because what if we abuse our power?
[00:49:19.040 --> 00:49:20.720]   I understand.
[00:49:20.720 --> 00:49:21.720]   And you're right.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:22.720]   We're men.
[00:49:22.720 --> 00:49:28.000]   Not sinless.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:32.120]   But I don't want to tell you, the Scripture commands it.
[00:49:32.120 --> 00:49:33.120]   It does.
[00:49:33.120 --> 00:49:34.800]   It does.
[00:49:34.800 --> 00:49:39.460]   But nobody wants that kind of submission.
[00:49:39.460 --> 00:49:41.000]   Nobody wants that kind of submission.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:43.480]   Hebrews 13 to 17, I go back to it.
[00:49:43.480 --> 00:49:49.800]   "Obey your leaders and submit to them, for they keep watch over your souls as those who
[00:49:49.800 --> 00:49:53.160]   will give an account."
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.400]   We have to give an account.
[00:49:54.400 --> 00:50:02.960]   "Let them do this with joy and not with grief, for this would be unprofitable for you."
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:09.720]   This would be unprofitable for you.
[00:50:09.720 --> 00:50:16.400]   There's another horizontal relationship that has the word "submission" implied, explicitly
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:17.400]   commanded.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:18.400]   I just talked about it.
[00:50:18.400 --> 00:50:21.240]   It's marriage, right?
[00:50:21.240 --> 00:50:23.720]   The wife is called to submit to the husband.
[00:50:23.720 --> 00:50:25.800]   That's what the Scriptures say.
[00:50:25.800 --> 00:50:29.000]   And the wife takes that risk with this dude.
[00:50:29.000 --> 00:50:31.960]   How is he going to be in five, ten years?
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.280]   But what is the husband's call?
[00:50:35.280 --> 00:50:38.440]   It's to love.
[00:50:38.440 --> 00:50:40.120]   But love in what manner?
[00:50:40.120 --> 00:50:42.280]   As Christ loved the church.
[00:50:42.280 --> 00:50:46.480]   To love unconditionally and to love deeply.
[00:50:46.480 --> 00:50:49.600]   And so we will do the same.
[00:50:49.600 --> 00:51:00.400]   We will love you unconditionally and we will love you deeply, no matter what you do.
[00:51:00.400 --> 00:51:07.880]   But just like in marriage, when submission is practiced correctly, within the confines
[00:51:07.880 --> 00:51:14.360]   of Scripture, maybe it'll become a witness to a dying world.
[00:51:14.360 --> 00:51:20.720]   A dying world where their picture of submission is encapsulated.
[00:51:20.720 --> 00:51:25.560]   It is filled with everything that is sin and corruption.
[00:51:25.560 --> 00:51:34.660]   But maybe when they step inside the church and they see submission done the way of Christ,
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:36.280]   maybe it'll glorify God.
[00:51:36.280 --> 00:51:40.240]   And maybe it'll be a witness to many.
[00:51:40.240 --> 00:51:43.920]   Isn't that the picture of marriage?
[00:51:43.920 --> 00:51:47.440]   Isn't that the picture of marriage?
[00:51:47.440 --> 00:51:54.640]   It is the same exact picture within the church.
[00:51:54.640 --> 00:51:56.480]   Accountability to what end?
[00:51:56.480 --> 00:51:59.280]   Submission to what end?
[00:51:59.280 --> 00:52:04.520]   Because of the example, the reason, and the goal.
[00:52:04.520 --> 00:52:07.160]   I know what I stated this morning is difficult.
[00:52:07.160 --> 00:52:08.680]   There's no doubt about it.
[00:52:08.680 --> 00:52:10.260]   It is difficult.
[00:52:10.260 --> 00:52:16.680]   And just like I said earlier, I love questions, and if you want to talk, let's talk.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:23.840]   If some of you here are offended by what I said, before you act on your state of being
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:28.700]   offended, think to yourself, what is propositional truth?
[00:52:28.700 --> 00:52:30.560]   What does the Bible say?
[00:52:30.560 --> 00:52:31.980]   And then work from there.
[00:52:31.980 --> 00:52:34.400]   Don't be offended and then read into the Scripture.
[00:52:34.400 --> 00:52:36.000]   What does the Scripture say?
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   And then go from there.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:45.160]   There are others of you who are rebuked, who are challenged.
[00:52:45.160 --> 00:52:49.940]   Maybe you're even despondent because the Word of God tends to cut.
[00:52:49.940 --> 00:52:51.080]   Don't stay there.
[00:52:51.080 --> 00:52:52.640]   Don't stay there.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:57.320]   Repent, abide, and God will make you strong.
