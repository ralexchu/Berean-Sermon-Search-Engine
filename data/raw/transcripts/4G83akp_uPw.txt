[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   - Good morning, Church family.
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:51.960]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:51.960 --> 00:04:54.960]   What a joy, blessing, and privilege it is
[00:04:54.960 --> 00:04:58.960]   that we all get to gather here together to worship our God.
[00:04:58.960 --> 00:05:00.960]   And so with that, we will begin our service.

[00:09:34.960 --> 00:09:37.960]   - Hi, good morning.
[00:09:37.960 --> 00:09:39.960]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:09:39.960 --> 00:09:41.960]   We have again a few announcements before we get started.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.960]   First of all, the BCC Service Auction Fundraiser.
[00:09:45.960 --> 00:09:47.960]   If you are a member of the church
[00:09:47.960 --> 00:09:49.960]   and you have some service that you wanna offer
[00:09:49.960 --> 00:09:51.960]   or you have some product that you wanna donate,
[00:09:51.960 --> 00:09:53.960]   they're still taking it up to this week.
[00:09:53.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   On February 25th is the deadline.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:57.960]   So if you are planning to do so,
[00:09:57.960 --> 00:09:58.960]   please sign up as soon as you can.
[00:09:58.960 --> 00:10:01.960]   And then the actual auction is gonna be taking place
[00:10:01.960 --> 00:10:03.960]   on March 12th.
[00:10:03.960 --> 00:10:06.960]   One other thing is Evangelism Seminar.
[00:10:06.960 --> 00:10:10.960]   Starting from March 5th, which is the first Sunday of March,
[00:10:10.960 --> 00:10:12.960]   for four weeks on Sundays at 1 p.m.,
[00:10:12.960 --> 00:10:15.960]   we're gonna be having our Evangelism Seminar.
[00:10:15.960 --> 00:10:16.960]   And it's not gonna be theoretical.
[00:10:16.960 --> 00:10:19.960]   We're gonna be giving a short instruction in the beginning
[00:10:19.960 --> 00:10:22.960]   and then we're all gonna go out to different places
[00:10:22.960 --> 00:10:26.960]   that we're gonna predetermine where we are into teams.
[00:10:26.960 --> 00:10:29.960]   And then we're gonna, again, try to encourage you
[00:10:29.960 --> 00:10:31.960]   to take some time to share the gospel
[00:10:31.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   and then whatever you experience,
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.960]   questions that may arise out of that,
[00:10:37.960 --> 00:10:39.960]   we wanna be able to practically train you
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.960]   so that our church is in the habit of sharing the gospel
[00:10:42.960 --> 00:10:43.960]   with the believers around us.
[00:10:43.960 --> 00:10:47.960]   So it doesn't make sense for us to claim this great gospel
[00:10:47.960 --> 00:10:50.960]   and then not be in a habit of sharing.
[00:10:50.960 --> 00:10:53.960]   So some of you guys may be intimidated by that.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:55.960]   And so this is a great opportunity.
[00:10:55.960 --> 00:10:56.960]   We'll team you up with other people
[00:10:56.960 --> 00:10:58.960]   who may be a bit more experienced.
[00:10:58.960 --> 00:11:00.960]   But at least be in the habit.
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:01.960]   We want our whole church, like we said,
[00:11:01.960 --> 00:11:04.960]   pray and proclaim is our theme.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:07.960]   And so we wanna get in the habit of encouraging you
[00:11:07.960 --> 00:11:11.960]   to, whether it's at work, whether it's just on campus,
[00:11:11.960 --> 00:11:14.960]   at least be in the habit and strengthen your muscles
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:16.960]   to be able to share this gospel, right?
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:18.960]   The gospel of the good news.
[00:11:18.960 --> 00:11:20.960]   So it doesn't make sense to have good news
[00:11:20.960 --> 00:11:22.960]   as a center of what we believe
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:23.960]   and then not to share this news.
[00:11:23.960 --> 00:11:26.960]   So this is starting on March 5th for four Sundays.
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:28.960]   And there will be a light lunch provided
[00:11:28.960 --> 00:11:29.960]   so that you don't have to worry about lunch.
[00:11:29.960 --> 00:11:31.960]   But again, if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:11:31.960 --> 00:11:32.960]   please sign up for that.
[00:11:32.960 --> 00:11:35.960]   And that will begin in a few weeks.
[00:11:35.960 --> 00:11:37.960]   If you are a parent of the seeds,
[00:11:37.960 --> 00:11:40.960]   there's a PTA meeting happening on Sunday on 26th,
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:42.960]   which is next Sunday at 1 p.m.
[00:11:42.960 --> 00:11:45.960]   And then BCC Cleaning and Maintenance Day.
[00:11:45.960 --> 00:11:49.960]   That's happening on March 4th, 9 a.m. to 12.
[00:11:49.960 --> 00:11:52.960]   So it's been a while since we had people gather
[00:11:52.960 --> 00:11:53.960]   and there's, you know,
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.960]   almost every part of the church needs cleaning.
[00:11:57.960 --> 00:11:59.960]   So if you're able that Saturday,
[00:11:59.960 --> 00:12:01.960]   please sign up for that and come and help us.
[00:12:01.960 --> 00:12:05.960]   We need as many people to come so that we can knock it out.
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:09.960]   So again, that's happening on March 4th, 9 a.m. to 12.
[00:12:09.960 --> 00:12:12.960]   And then one last announcement, the Jubilee Lunch Fellowship.
[00:12:12.960 --> 00:12:15.960]   If you are of the age of 50 and over, okay,
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.960]   and I know some of you guys who are newer to the church,
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:20.960]   50 and over, say, "Oh, I don't see any 50 and over
[00:12:20.960 --> 00:12:21.960]   at our church."
[00:12:21.960 --> 00:12:24.960]   You'd be surprised how many 50 and over people are at our church
[00:12:24.960 --> 00:12:26.960]   when we gather together.
[00:12:26.960 --> 00:12:29.960]   So we are having a fellowship for that at 1 p.m.
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:32.960]   And I think there was an announcement that you may have gotten,
[00:12:32.960 --> 00:12:35.960]   that was March 19th, that that is not the right date.
[00:12:35.960 --> 00:12:37.960]   There's a conflict on that date.
[00:12:37.960 --> 00:12:39.960]   So it is going to be on April 2nd.
[00:12:39.960 --> 00:12:43.960]   So April 2nd is Palm Sunday.
[00:12:43.960 --> 00:12:45.960]   And so at 1 p.m. there will be fellowship
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.960]   with the Jubilee Fellowship at 50 and over.
[00:12:49.960 --> 00:12:52.960]   And $10 per person.
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   Okay?
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:55.960]   I think that's all the announcements.
[00:12:55.960 --> 00:12:58.960]   So after I pray for our offering, after our worship set,
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:00.960]   our sister Teresa is going to come up,
[00:13:00.960 --> 00:13:03.960]   and she's going to give her testimony and be baptized this morning.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:04.960]   Okay?
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:06.960]   So if you are new to the church and you have physical offering,
[00:13:06.960 --> 00:13:09.960]   we do have a physical box, offering box in the back.
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:12.960]   But for the rest of you, we'll give you a minute to give your offering.
[00:13:12.960 --> 00:13:16.960]   Okay? Let's pray.
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:20.960]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the gathering of the saints.
[00:13:20.960 --> 00:13:22.960]   We thank you for the privilege that we have
[00:13:22.960 --> 00:13:26.960]   to be able to come before your presence and worship you.
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:29.960]   We pray, Father, that whatever burdens and distractions
[00:13:29.960 --> 00:13:32.960]   we may have brought into this room,
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:36.960]   help us, Lord God, to find our refuge in you.
[00:13:36.960 --> 00:13:40.960]   Help us to continue to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[00:13:40.960 --> 00:13:44.960]   the author and the perfecter of our faith.
[00:13:44.960 --> 00:13:46.960]   We pray that even in our giving,
[00:13:46.960 --> 00:13:50.960]   it would prepare our hearts, Lord God, to worship,
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:53.960]   that it may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:55.960]   for your use, for your kingdom.
[00:13:55.960 --> 00:13:59.960]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:14:45.960 --> 00:14:48.960]   Let us all rise as we sing these praises.
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:56.960]   [music]
[00:14:56.960 --> 00:15:10.960]   I was a Northerner.
[00:15:10.960 --> 00:15:13.960]   I was a Northerner lost at the fall,
[00:15:13.960 --> 00:15:17.960]   Running away would not hear your call.
[00:15:17.960 --> 00:15:20.960]   But Father, you worked your will.
[00:15:20.960 --> 00:15:26.960]   I had no righteousness of my own.
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:30.960]   I had no right to draw near your throne.
[00:15:30.960 --> 00:15:33.960]   But Father, you loved me still.
[00:15:33.960 --> 00:15:41.960]   And in love before you laid the world's foundation,
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:46.960]   You predestined to adopt me as your own.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:53.960]   You have raised me up so high above my station.
[00:15:53.960 --> 00:15:59.960]   I'm a child of God by grace, a grace of love.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.960]   [music]
[00:16:04.960 --> 00:16:07.960]   [music]
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:17.960]   You left your home to seek out the lost.
[00:16:17.960 --> 00:16:20.960]   You knew the great and terrible cost.
[00:16:20.960 --> 00:16:24.960]   But Jesus, your face was set.
[00:16:24.960 --> 00:16:30.960]   I wove my fingers down to the bone.
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:33.960]   Nothing I did could ever atone.
[00:16:34.960 --> 00:16:37.960]   Jesus, you paid my debt.
[00:16:37.960 --> 00:16:44.960]   By your blood I had redemption and salvation.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:50.960]   Lord, you died that I might reap what you have sown.
[00:16:50.960 --> 00:16:57.960]   And you rose that I might be of you creation.
[00:16:58.960 --> 00:17:03.960]   I am born again by grace, a grace of love.
[00:17:03.960 --> 00:17:08.960]   I was in darkness all of my life.
[00:17:08.960 --> 00:17:12.960]   I never knew the day from the night.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:15.960]   The Spirit, you made me see.
[00:17:15.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   I swore I knew the way on my own.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   I've been full of rocks, I've hardly been stoned.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:28.960]   But Spirit, you've lifted me.
[00:17:28.960 --> 00:17:35.960]   And your touch, my sleeping spirit, was awakened.
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:41.960]   On my death you were the light across the shore.
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:48.960]   Call it a turn, but keep the knack and not be shaken.
[00:17:48.960 --> 00:17:54.960]   Heaven sends in my grace, a grace of love.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.960]   So I'll stand and make my grace, a grace of love.
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:06.960]   I will run to reach my grace, a grace of love.
[00:18:06.960 --> 00:18:13.960]   I will slay my sin by grace, a grace of love.
[00:18:13.960 --> 00:18:20.960]   I will reach the end by grace, a grace of love.
[00:18:20.960 --> 00:18:25.960]   (instrumental music)
[00:18:25.960 --> 00:18:42.960]   I am not skilled.
[00:18:42.960 --> 00:18:45.960]   I am not skilled to understand.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:52.960]   What God has willed, what God has planned.
[00:18:52.960 --> 00:18:58.960]   I only know what is right.
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:05.960]   Stand one who is my Savior.
[00:19:05.960 --> 00:19:11.960]   I take Him at His word and dear.
[00:19:11.960 --> 00:19:17.960]   Christ died to save me this I read.
[00:19:18.960 --> 00:19:22.960]   And in my heart I find the need
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:29.960]   of Him to be my Savior.
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:35.960]   That He would leave His place on earth
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:41.960]   and come for sinful man to die.
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:48.960]   You find it strange so I stand up
[00:19:48.960 --> 00:19:55.960]   before I knew my Savior.
[00:19:55.960 --> 00:19:59.960]   My Savior lives, my Savior lives.
[00:19:59.960 --> 00:20:02.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:20:02.960 --> 00:20:05.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:08.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:20:08.960 --> 00:20:12.960]   My Savior lives, my Savior lives.
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:16.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:19.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:20:19.960 --> 00:20:23.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:20:23.960 --> 00:20:30.960]   Yes, living, dying, left me here.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.960]   My strength, my soul is from this land.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:42.960]   That He who lives to be my King
[00:20:42.960 --> 00:20:49.960]   once died to be my Savior.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   That He would leave His place on earth
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:21:01.960]   and come for sinful man to die.
[00:21:04.960 --> 00:21:08.960]   You find it strange so I stand up
[00:21:08.960 --> 00:21:14.960]   before I knew my Savior.
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:18.960]   My Savior lives, my Savior lives.
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:21.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:24.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:21:24.960 --> 00:21:28.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.960]   My Savior lives, my Savior lives.
[00:21:31.960 --> 00:21:34.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:21:34.960 --> 00:21:37.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:41.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:21:41.960 --> 00:21:44.960]   (soulful music)
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:22:07.960]   My Savior loves.
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   My Savior loves, my Savior lives.
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:14.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:22:14.960 --> 00:22:17.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:20.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:22:20.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   My Savior loves, my Savior lives.
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:27.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:22:27.960 --> 00:22:30.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:22:30.960 --> 00:22:33.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.960]   My Savior loves, my Savior lives.
[00:22:36.960 --> 00:22:40.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:49.960]   My Savior loves, my Savior lives.
[00:22:49.960 --> 00:22:52.960]   My Savior is always there for me.
[00:22:52.960 --> 00:22:56.960]   My God He was, my God He is.
[00:22:56.960 --> 00:22:59.960]   My God is always gonna be.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   (soulful music)
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:06.960]   I am not skilled to understand
[00:23:06.960 --> 00:23:13.960]   what God has willed, what God has planned.
[00:23:13.960 --> 00:23:19.960]   I only know that His right hand
[00:23:19.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   stands one who is my Savior.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   Amen, you may be seated.
[00:23:31.960 --> 00:23:34.960]   (soulful music)
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:45.960]   - Hi church, I'm T, or Teresa,
[00:23:45.960 --> 00:23:48.960]   and this is my testimony.
[00:23:48.960 --> 00:23:51.960]   So before Christ, I pursued the worldly love
[00:23:51.960 --> 00:23:53.960]   I grew up seeing in the media,
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:55.960]   thinking that that was life's purpose,
[00:23:55.960 --> 00:23:57.960]   how I can find happiness.
[00:23:57.960 --> 00:23:59.960]   I worshipped approval from others
[00:23:59.960 --> 00:24:01.960]   and romantic relationships that would make me feel
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:03.960]   known, loved, and valued.
[00:24:03.960 --> 00:24:06.960]   As a result, this pursuit led me to fill the void
[00:24:06.960 --> 00:24:09.960]   I felt in my life with romantic relationships
[00:24:09.960 --> 00:24:12.960]   and acceptance from others that never quite measured up
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:14.960]   to what I would later learn was the search
[00:24:14.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   and satisfaction for Christ Himself.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:19.960]   Idolizing love and affirmation from others
[00:24:19.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   resulted in me feeling insecure and inadequate,
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:25.960]   and it wasn't until my sophomore year in college,
[00:24:25.960 --> 00:24:27.960]   through trials and the people that God graciously placed
[00:24:27.960 --> 00:24:29.960]   in my life to guide me and pray over me
[00:24:29.960 --> 00:24:32.960]   that I came to truly know Christ.
[00:24:32.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   Entering college, I felt exhausted from having
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:37.960]   to present myself a certain way,
[00:24:37.960 --> 00:24:38.960]   to please my friends and family,
[00:24:38.960 --> 00:24:40.960]   and I felt so lost as I was struggling
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   to find purpose in life, as well as happiness
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.960]   in the relationship I was in at that time.
[00:24:45.960 --> 00:24:47.960]   Right before leaving for college,
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   I was sexually abused and raped by my then partner,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:53.960]   and it left me feeling very unclean, shameful,
[00:24:53.960 --> 00:24:57.960]   confused, and made me feel that love was very conditional.
[00:24:57.960 --> 00:25:00.960]   I believed in the lie shaped by my circumstances
[00:25:00.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   that I was unworthy and unlovable,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   and it left me feeling so insecure and ashamed.
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:07.960]   I thought that there was something fundamentally
[00:25:07.960 --> 00:25:09.960]   flawed with me, and that if anyone knew
[00:25:09.960 --> 00:25:11.960]   of the sexual abuse I experienced,
[00:25:11.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I'd be shunned and hated by the people around me.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   Externally, I continued living life like everything was okay
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:20.960]   and maintained the bright and bubbly personality
[00:25:20.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   friends and family expected me to have,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:26.960]   while internally, I was in turmoil and felt so lost.
[00:25:26.960 --> 00:25:28.960]   But it was in that place where God met me
[00:25:28.960 --> 00:25:30.960]   in a real and powerful way.
[00:25:30.960 --> 00:25:32.960]   I didn't expect to attend church and college,
[00:25:32.960 --> 00:25:34.960]   but ended up doing so freshman year
[00:25:34.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   through a friend's invitation,
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:37.960]   and because I didn't know how to say no.
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:40.960]   The contents of the service didn't really stick out to me,
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   but I saw and felt something different
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:45.960]   in the community there, and so I kept on coming out.
[00:25:45.960 --> 00:25:47.960]   In addition to them being warm and welcoming,
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   each person I met genuinely seemed so at peace
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:52.960]   and had a deep joy, and so I knew pretty early on
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:25:55.960]   that whatever they had, I was missing,
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:25:57.960]   and that launched my journey to learn more
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:00.960]   about the God that they worshipped and claimed was love.
[00:26:00.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   As I attended Bible studies and church services,
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:05.960]   it was through hearing and reading God's word frequently,
[00:26:05.960 --> 00:26:08.960]   asking a lot of questions, reflecting,
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:10.960]   and through prayer that God gradually revealed to me
[00:26:10.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   the depravity of my heart as a sinner
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   who deserves to die before a holy God.
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:17.960]   I came to understand that God, our creator,
[00:26:17.960 --> 00:26:20.960]   was reaching out to me despite knowing my failed attempts
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   at love, my shame, and disappointments.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   He wasn't there to judge me or shame me,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   but to accept me and show compassion towards me
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:28.960]   because of what Jesus did on the cross.
[00:26:28.960 --> 00:26:31.960]   He invites me to leave my life of sin,
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.960]   invites me to forgiveness, and invites me
[00:26:33.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   to be fully known and loved by him who created me.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:38.960]   However, I thought that this good news
[00:26:38.960 --> 00:26:40.960]   was too good to be true.
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:42.960]   I believed that I had to earn and work my way
[00:26:42.960 --> 00:26:44.960]   towards God's forgiveness, and I accepted the lie
[00:26:44.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   that some sins are just too dirty
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:48.960]   for Christ's blood to fully cleanse.
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:50.960]   I was stuck in shame and was determined
[00:26:50.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   that because of my sinful choices and decisions,
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:55.960]   I was less than and deserved to have less than,
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   and that I was beyond redemption.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:00.960]   But Ephesians 2, 8, 9, Titus 3, 5,
[00:27:00.960 --> 00:27:03.960]   and 2 Corinthians 12, 9 helped me to understand
[00:27:03.960 --> 00:27:05.960]   that he saved us not because of works done by us
[00:27:05.960 --> 00:27:08.960]   in righteousness, but according to his mercy and grace,
[00:27:08.960 --> 00:27:10.960]   and that God's grace is sufficient,
[00:27:10.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   and that it's always going to be greater than my sins.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   My sinfulness was gradually made known to me
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   as I reflected and listed them out,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   and it allowed me to see that I was pursuing love
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:22.960]   in the wrong places, and that I was full of evil thoughts
[00:27:22.960 --> 00:27:24.960]   as a result of my pride, lust, shame,
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:26.960]   and my love for the world.
[00:27:26.960 --> 00:27:28.960]   Though I'm undeserving, God in his love and mercy
[00:27:28.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   chose to extend his grace to me
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:32.960]   by sending his son to die on the cross for me.
[00:27:32.960 --> 00:27:34.960]   Jesus made a way for me to have peace
[00:27:34.960 --> 00:27:37.960]   and be made right with God by the blood of his cross,
[00:27:37.960 --> 00:27:39.960]   not because of who I was or what I could do,
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   but because of who he is.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:44.960]   I was able to recognize my hopeless situation
[00:27:44.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   as nothing I could do would erase
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:48.960]   or undo the wickedness of my heart
[00:27:48.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   or bridge the gap that I made between me and God.
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.960]   And I felt humbled when I came to understand
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:54.960]   that although I had lived a life
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.960]   not recognizing Jesus' love and sacrifice,
[00:27:57.960 --> 00:27:59.960]   Jesus made it his mission to save me
[00:27:59.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   by willingly taking my punishment to the cross
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   in my place so that I could be forgiven.
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.960]   And in understanding this good news,
[00:28:06.960 --> 00:28:08.960]   I wanted to respond joyfully and willingly,
[00:28:08.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   and so I confessed my sins,
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:12.960]   and through putting my faith in Jesus,
[00:28:12.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   I was able to receive this incredible grace
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   that was given to me through his sacrifice,
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   and I made the commitment to accept him
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:20.960]   as my Lord and Savior.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:22.960]   In hindsight, it's amazing how I met God
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:25.960]   after experiencing so much loneliness,
[00:28:25.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   emptiness, and dissatisfaction with life,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:29.960]   but it's even more amazing how God
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.960]   used these moments of suffering
[00:28:31.960 --> 00:28:33.960]   so that I can know that it is only him
[00:28:33.960 --> 00:28:35.960]   who can satisfy me,
[00:28:35.960 --> 00:28:37.960]   and I'm so thankful that God pursued my heart
[00:28:37.960 --> 00:28:39.960]   so relentlessly.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:41.960]   Jesus says in John 6, 35,
[00:28:41.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   "Out of life, whoever comes to me shall not hunger,
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:45.960]   "and whoever believes in me shall never thirst."
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:47.960]   And he says to the Samaritan woman at the well,
[00:28:47.960 --> 00:28:50.960]   "If you drink of this water, you will thirst again,
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   "but if you drink of the water that I give you,
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:54.960]   "you will never be thirsty."
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   And so Jesus has satisfied me and quenched my thirst
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:28:58.960]   in a way that nothing else in the world could.
[00:28:58.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   All this time, I tried finding purpose
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   and happiness in people and through approval,
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   and I let these worldly things rob my joy
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:07.960]   and steal my peace.
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   Recognizing how empty the love and approval
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.960]   I sought after in the world was so freeing,
[00:29:11.960 --> 00:29:13.960]   and after receiving God's grace,
[00:29:13.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   my insecurity and inadequacy
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:17.960]   turned to security and reassurance
[00:29:17.960 --> 00:29:19.960]   because my identity was no longer tied
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:21.960]   to worldly relationships or to pleasing people,
[00:29:21.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   but is rooted in knowing Christ.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:25.960]   He has fulfilled my desire
[00:29:25.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   to be known, loved, and accepted,
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:29.960]   and although I'm flawed and undeserving
[00:29:29.960 --> 00:29:31.960]   in many ways, God still shows me his love.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   And while the things I was pursuing before
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:35.960]   continually let me down,
[00:29:35.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   God didn't leave me and loved me
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:39.960]   to the lowest point and saved me.
[00:29:39.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   I no longer feel unworthy or feel the need
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   to prove myself, as I now rest assured
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:46.960]   and am filled with God's unconditional love for me.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   My identity is in who God says I am,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:50.960]   his beloved child.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   And although I still have my battles,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:54.960]   I now find peace, comfort, and love in them
[00:29:54.960 --> 00:29:56.960]   because I am confident that on the other side,
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   there is victory through his glory
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.960]   and grace in my new life,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:02.960]   and I will strive to live a life that glorifies him,
[00:30:02.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   proclaiming Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   Thank you.
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:17.960]   [applause]
[00:30:18.960 --> 00:30:29.960]   [silence]
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:46.960]   [indistinct conversation]
[00:30:46.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   [applause]
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:01.960]   - All right, Teresa, thank you for that
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:03.960]   powerful testimony. You know, one of my favorite
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   quotes is Corrie Ten Boone.
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   Some of you guys who may know who she is,
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:11.960]   says, "There is no darkness that Satan can create
[00:31:11.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   that the love of God cannot penetrate."
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:15.960]   And so I think that pretty much summarizes
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:17.960]   her testimony.
[00:31:17.960 --> 00:31:19.960]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   to Luke chapter 4,
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:23.960]   and again, I will be doing part 2 of this section,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   chapter 4, verse 31
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:27.960]   through verse 37.
[00:31:27.960 --> 00:31:30.960]   And reading out of the NASB,
[00:31:30.960 --> 00:31:32.960]   "And he came down to Capernaum,
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   a city of Galilee, and he was teaching them
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:36.960]   on the Sabbath, and they were amazed at his teaching,
[00:31:36.960 --> 00:31:39.960]   for his message was with authority.
[00:31:39.960 --> 00:31:41.960]   In a synagogue there was a man possessed by the spirit
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:43.960]   of an unclean demon, and he cried out
[00:31:43.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   with a loud voice, 'Let us alone!
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:47.960]   What business do we have with each other,
[00:31:47.960 --> 00:31:49.960]   Jesus of Nazareth?
[00:31:49.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   Have you come to destroy us?
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   I know who you are, the Holy One of God.'
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:55.960]   But Jesus rebuked him, saying,
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   'Be quiet, and come out of him.'
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960]   And when the demon had thrown him down
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.960]   in the midst of the people, he came out of him
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:03.960]   without doing him any harm.
[00:32:03.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   And amazement came upon them all,
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:08.960]   and they began talking with one another,
[00:32:08.960 --> 00:32:10.960]   saying, 'What is this message?
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:12.960]   For with authority and power
[00:32:12.960 --> 00:32:14.960]   he commands the unclean spirits, and they come out.'
[00:32:14.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   And the report about him
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:18.960]   was spreading into every locality
[00:32:18.960 --> 00:32:20.960]   in the surrounding district."
[00:32:20.960 --> 00:32:22.960]   Let's pray.
[00:32:22.960 --> 00:32:24.960]   Father, we pray that your word,
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:26.960]   and only your word, would go forth.
[00:32:26.960 --> 00:32:28.960]   We pray that you would
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   protect the pulpit.
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:32.960]   We would protect, Lord,
[00:32:32.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   and guide our hearts and our ears.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:36.960]   That only your word, anointed
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:38.960]   by your spirit, Lord God, would have any
[00:32:38.960 --> 00:32:40.960]   impact on us.
[00:32:40.960 --> 00:32:42.960]   So we pray for your grace,
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   and your Holy Spirit's guidance. In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:46.960]   Amen.
[00:32:46.960 --> 00:32:48.960]   Last week we looked at
[00:32:48.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   the authority that people
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:52.960]   recognized as soon as Jesus opened his mouth
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:54.960]   and began to preach his sermon,
[00:32:54.960 --> 00:32:56.960]   and how for 400 years,
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:32:58.960]   basically the scribes were babbling.
[00:32:58.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   They were quoting one another,
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:02.960]   and the word of God basically
[00:33:02.960 --> 00:33:04.960]   dried up, not because the scroll was lost,
[00:33:04.960 --> 00:33:06.960]   necessarily, but because God
[00:33:06.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   did not send his servants.
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:10.960]   And so when Jesus opened
[00:33:10.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   to preach,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:14.960]   for the first time in 400 years,
[00:33:14.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   an unadulterated word of God
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.960]   was heard.
[00:33:18.960 --> 00:33:20.960]   And they heard it, they were amazed.
[00:33:20.960 --> 00:33:22.960]   They were thrown back.
[00:33:22.960 --> 00:33:24.960]   That's the word for amazement.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:26.960]   Today we're looking at the text where
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:28.960]   as a result of his preaching, they were amazed.
[00:33:28.960 --> 00:33:30.960]   A demon-possessed man
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   has an encounter
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.960]   with Christ, and Jesus
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   casts him out, and again,
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:38.960]   we recognize his authority
[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   and power even over the demons.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:42.960]   When it comes to
[00:33:42.960 --> 00:33:44.960]   what we understand about demons,
[00:33:44.960 --> 00:33:46.960]   if I ask you
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:48.960]   to draw a picture of a demon
[00:33:48.960 --> 00:33:50.960]   or an angel,
[00:33:50.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   my guess is most of you
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:54.960]   will draw a picture of a demon that's ugly,
[00:33:54.960 --> 00:33:56.960]   filthy, maybe red,
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:58.960]   with the horns,
[00:33:58.960 --> 00:34:00.960]   and whatever it may be, but it would be
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:02.960]   an ugly picture, and if I asked you to draw a picture of an angel,
[00:34:02.960 --> 00:34:04.960]   it would be very aesthetically beautiful,
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   white, you know, something that you would
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:08.960]   maybe put on a mantle
[00:34:08.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   somewhere.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:12.960]   But our understanding,
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:14.960]   or our concept of the devil and the demons,
[00:34:14.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   so much of it comes
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:18.960]   from Hollywood. The Bible does not
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:20.960]   paint the picture of the demons
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:22.960]   aesthetically any different
[00:34:22.960 --> 00:34:24.960]   than the angels.
[00:34:24.960 --> 00:34:26.960]   They were created beings just like
[00:34:26.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   angels. And so the only
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:30.960]   difference, only physical difference
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.960]   between an angel and a demon
[00:34:32.960 --> 00:34:34.960]   would be their moral quality,
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:36.960]   not the way they look.
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:38.960]   So so much of what we
[00:34:38.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   understand of the demonic
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:42.960]   comes from Hollywood, the movies that we've watched,
[00:34:42.960 --> 00:34:44.960]   or maybe books that we've
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:46.960]   read, or maybe paintings that
[00:34:46.960 --> 00:34:48.960]   we might have seen. But it may not
[00:34:48.960 --> 00:34:50.960]   be what the Bible teaches us.
[00:34:50.960 --> 00:34:54.960]   I was saved, even though I grew
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   up in a Presbyterian home, I was saved
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   in a charismatic background, and so
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:00.960]   in the charismatic background, everything was
[00:35:00.960 --> 00:35:02.960]   demonic. And so I was
[00:35:02.960 --> 00:35:04.960]   told that the music was demonic, the movies
[00:35:04.960 --> 00:35:06.960]   were demonic. I was told that there would be
[00:35:06.960 --> 00:35:08.960]   regions that are demonic.
[00:35:08.960 --> 00:35:10.960]   And then I was also told that in one
[00:35:10.960 --> 00:35:12.960]   place where the dolls can be demonic,
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   and so you can't own dolls.
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   Or football, there's a demon
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   of football, because everybody who plays football, they
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   seem to backslide.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:22.960]   I had this picture of the demonic world
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   where I was almost afraid to get up in
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:26.960]   the middle of the night, because I was afraid every dark
[00:35:26.960 --> 00:35:28.960]   corner there was some demon waiting.
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:30.960]   Right? Obviously
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   that's not biblical either.
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:34.960]   Or, you have the other extreme
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.960]   where everything is so
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:38.960]   Western, and if you can't prove anything
[00:35:38.960 --> 00:35:40.960]   mystical, it's not real. So even though,
[00:35:40.960 --> 00:35:42.960]   like in a Bible teaching church,
[00:35:42.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   we may understand that the Bible
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:46.960]   teaches that the demonic world is real,
[00:35:46.960 --> 00:35:48.960]   but we don't actually live
[00:35:48.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   as if it's real. It's just kind of a
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:52.960]   side note, right? It's like, it's
[00:35:52.960 --> 00:35:54.960]   mentioned in the Bible, so clearly we believe that.
[00:35:54.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   But we don't function like
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.960]   the demonic world is real.
[00:35:58.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   But, the
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:02.960]   danger in that, is that the Bible
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.960]   clearly tells us, Paul tells us
[00:36:04.960 --> 00:36:06.960]   in the book of Ephesians chapter 6,
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:08.960]   and I'm just going to read verse 12, he says
[00:36:08.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   "For our struggle is not against
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:12.960]   flesh and blood, but against
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:14.960]   the rulers, against the powers, against the world
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:16.960]   forces of darkness, against
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:18.960]   the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:36:18.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   in the heavenly places." So Paul
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:22.960]   reminds us, that our
[00:36:22.960 --> 00:36:24.960]   struggle isn't simply getting
[00:36:24.960 --> 00:36:26.960]   the right, you know,
[00:36:26.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   right training, or getting the right knowledge,
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   and since this is wrong, identify
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:32.960]   what's wrong, and then find three steps to kind of
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:34.960]   improve this, and if we can get the
[00:36:34.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   right thinking, right training, right
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:38.960]   education, that we're going to be able to save
[00:36:38.960 --> 00:36:40.960]   people, we're going to be able to be sanctified, and
[00:36:40.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   disciple people, if we just have the right program.
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   He first and foremost,
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   tells us, our struggle
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:48.960]   is not against flesh and blood.
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   So the
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:52.960]   first and foremost, it's not something
[00:36:52.960 --> 00:36:54.960]   that we can do simply by flesh
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:36:56.960]   and blood, whether justification,
[00:36:56.960 --> 00:36:58.960]   sanctification, or glorification. There is
[00:36:58.960 --> 00:37:00.960]   a spiritual battle going on, and he
[00:37:00.960 --> 00:37:02.960]   warns us, so that the people
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:04.960]   would be, would know
[00:37:04.960 --> 00:37:06.960]   that we have an enemy
[00:37:06.960 --> 00:37:08.960]   that is attacking us. There's a demonic
[00:37:08.960 --> 00:37:10.960]   world that is real.
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:14.960]   So, you know,
[00:37:14.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   I'm not going to have time
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:18.960]   this morning, because my purpose
[00:37:18.960 --> 00:37:20.960]   this morning is not to go into demonology.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.960]   There's plenty
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:24.960]   that we can learn about what the Bible teaches us
[00:37:24.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   about the demonic world.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   But my goal is not that. I'm going to give you a
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   quick
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.960]   cliff-note version of demonology.
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:34.960]   One of these days, maybe we'll
[00:37:34.960 --> 00:37:36.960]   dive a little bit deeper into this.
[00:37:36.960 --> 00:37:38.960]   And trust me, it is interesting.
[00:37:38.960 --> 00:37:40.960]   It is very interesting.
[00:37:40.960 --> 00:37:42.960]   There's so little material out there about
[00:37:42.960 --> 00:37:44.960]   the work of the demon from
[00:37:44.960 --> 00:37:46.960]   Genesis. There's an anti-
[00:37:46.960 --> 00:37:48.960]   work of the demon, all the way from Genesis,
[00:37:48.960 --> 00:37:50.960]   all the way to Revelation. But because
[00:37:50.960 --> 00:37:52.960]   they're not the central figure, we
[00:37:52.960 --> 00:37:54.960]   end up talking about the central figure, and
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   then the demonic world is just kind of like, "Ah, yeah,
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:58.960]   it was there. Yeah, they started this problem."
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:00.960]   But when you actually really
[00:38:00.960 --> 00:38:02.960]   dive into it, it is very interesting.
[00:38:02.960 --> 00:38:04.960]   Right?
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   Which we're not going to get into today. Okay? This is just
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:08.960]   a, one of these days when this happens,
[00:38:08.960 --> 00:38:10.960]   come to the seminar. Okay.
[00:38:10.960 --> 00:38:14.960]   Let me give you a, just
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   a quick summary. The Bible says
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:18.960]   that the demonic,
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:20.960]   demonic world is large
[00:38:20.960 --> 00:38:22.960]   in number.
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   Now, whether this is true or not, many theologians
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:26.960]   believe a third of the angels
[00:38:26.960 --> 00:38:28.960]   were kicked out of heaven because they
[00:38:28.960 --> 00:38:30.960]   chose to follow satanic rebellion.
[00:38:30.960 --> 00:38:34.960]   Now, the reason why that's interesting
[00:38:34.960 --> 00:38:36.960]   is because in Hebrews chapter 10,
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   verse 22, when it talks about the angels,
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   he says, "The word
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:42.960]   that is used is myriads of angels,
[00:38:42.960 --> 00:38:44.960]   countless."
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:46.960]   So it is so
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:48.960]   large. And you know,
[00:38:48.960 --> 00:38:50.960]   if you, again, we're not going to get into
[00:38:50.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   angeology. The power of just one angel
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:54.960]   is so powerful that
[00:38:54.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   even armies can be thwarted by the
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   power of one angel. And the
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:00.960]   Bible says that there are myriads of them
[00:39:00.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   and a third of them followed
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:04.960]   satanic influence.
[00:39:04.960 --> 00:39:06.960]   Which means the demonic
[00:39:06.960 --> 00:39:08.960]   world is powerful and it is
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:10.960]   numerous.
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   Demons have the ability to
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:14.960]   possess people. Oftentimes when
[00:39:14.960 --> 00:39:16.960]   we encounter
[00:39:16.960 --> 00:39:18.960]   demonic encounters just like this,
[00:39:18.960 --> 00:39:20.960]   it's usually because the demons have possessed
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:22.960]   somebody. And the distinction
[00:39:22.960 --> 00:39:24.960]   that we see between the demonic possession
[00:39:24.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   and demonic influence is that
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   the demons can possess non-Christians
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   because they
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   are in the domain of
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:34.960]   Satan. Christians,
[00:39:34.960 --> 00:39:36.960]   the believers, cannot be possessed by
[00:39:36.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   demons, but they are influenced.
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   And that's the difference between what we see with
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:42.960]   Judas and Peter. Where Judas was
[00:39:42.960 --> 00:39:44.960]   possessed by the devil, where
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:46.960]   Peter is influenced by the devil.
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:48.960]   Demons pervert
[00:39:48.960 --> 00:39:50.960]   the truth.
[00:39:50.960 --> 00:39:52.960]   He's a father of lies.
[00:39:52.960 --> 00:39:54.960]   So it takes truth. And every encounter
[00:39:54.960 --> 00:39:56.960]   that we see where the demon
[00:39:56.960 --> 00:39:58.960]   quotes the Bible is that they
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:00.960]   quote the central teachings of the Bible
[00:40:00.960 --> 00:40:02.960]   and then he perverts it and he applies
[00:40:02.960 --> 00:40:04.960]   it in a way that is rebellious
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:06.960]   against God.
[00:40:06.960 --> 00:40:08.960]   So one of the primary work of
[00:40:08.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   the devil is pervert the truth.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   Its desire
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.960]   is to devour it says.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:16.960]   It says it's not just
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   there just
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:20.960]   randomly doing its work.
[00:40:20.960 --> 00:40:22.960]   Its primary desire is to
[00:40:22.960 --> 00:40:24.960]   divert, to pervert,
[00:40:24.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   and then to destroy.
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.960]   That's his primary work.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:30.960]   Demons desire worship
[00:40:30.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   of their own. And that's why they're
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.960]   rebelling. Satan rebelled
[00:40:34.960 --> 00:40:36.960]   against God because he wanted the glory that
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:38.960]   God was getting. And so he
[00:40:38.960 --> 00:40:40.960]   tempted a third of the angels
[00:40:40.960 --> 00:40:42.960]   to follow him. So their primary
[00:40:42.960 --> 00:40:44.960]   goal is to seek their own glory.
[00:40:44.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   And so
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:48.960]   they want to pervert the glory
[00:40:48.960 --> 00:40:50.960]   of God.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:52.960]   Demons can manifest
[00:40:52.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   demons
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:40:56.960]   usually manifest as something very
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:58.960]   beautiful.
[00:40:58.960 --> 00:41:00.960]   Our idea of a demon
[00:41:00.960 --> 00:41:02.960]   who's ugly with a pitchfork
[00:41:02.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   and Freddy Krueger, if you guys
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:06.960]   know who that is.
[00:41:06.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   Like something ugly
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:10.960]   that you usually get from Hollywood. That is
[00:41:10.960 --> 00:41:12.960]   not the picture that is seen in the Bible. The Bible
[00:41:12.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   says Satan was created as a
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   beautiful being.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:18.960]   And the angels, just like the
[00:41:18.960 --> 00:41:20.960]   angels who have not fallen, we usually picture them
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:22.960]   as beautiful.
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:24.960]   The demons, aesthetically,
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   are also beautiful.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:28.960]   And the reason why they are so
[00:41:28.960 --> 00:41:30.960]   effective is because they're beautiful.
[00:41:30.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   The reason why they are so tempting
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.960]   is because they have beauty.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:36.960]   The Bible describes them
[00:41:36.960 --> 00:41:38.960]   as beautiful beings
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:40.960]   who are intent to destroy,
[00:41:40.960 --> 00:41:42.960]   to pervert,
[00:41:42.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   and seek their own glory.
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.960]   Demons mimic
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.960]   the work of Christ. Remember when we were studying
[00:41:48.960 --> 00:41:50.960]   the book of Revelation? The death
[00:41:50.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   and then resurrection and then it kind of
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:54.960]   deceived and kind of got them
[00:41:54.960 --> 00:41:56.960]   to
[00:41:56.960 --> 00:41:58.960]   think that there was a miracle that took place, a resurrection
[00:41:58.960 --> 00:42:00.960]   took place, and then all of that energy
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:02.960]   was given to the dragon?
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.960]   If you remember, so
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:06.960]   the primary work, the way he
[00:42:06.960 --> 00:42:08.960]   deceives and lies and destroys,
[00:42:08.960 --> 00:42:10.960]   is by mimicking the work of Christ.
[00:42:10.960 --> 00:42:14.960]   And the Bible says
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:16.960]   that the devil comes as
[00:42:16.960 --> 00:42:18.960]   an angel of light.
[00:42:18.960 --> 00:42:20.960]   Now,
[00:42:20.960 --> 00:42:22.960]   all of these things, right, there's a quick, quick
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:24.960]   version, right, of
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:26.960]   demonology.
[00:42:26.960 --> 00:42:28.960]   If the demonic work,
[00:42:28.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   he can possess people, influence people,
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:32.960]   he can pervert the truth,
[00:42:32.960 --> 00:42:34.960]   he is set to devour,
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:36.960]   right, and he desires
[00:42:36.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   his own worship, he is beautiful,
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:40.960]   and he mimics the work
[00:42:40.960 --> 00:42:42.960]   of Christ, what is the most
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:44.960]   effective way to do that?
[00:42:44.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   In the church.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   Through the pulpit.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.960]   The most effective way
[00:42:54.960 --> 00:42:56.960]   that a demon can influence and destroy
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:58.960]   and pervert the truth is by
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:00.960]   perverting this pulpit.
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   By having
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   a pastor who should not be a pastor,
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:06.960]   by having somebody standing here
[00:43:06.960 --> 00:43:08.960]   proclaiming the truth and deceiving
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   you, because this is the best place,
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:12.960]   the most effective place,
[00:43:12.960 --> 00:43:14.960]   to do the most damage.
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:16.960]   And this is why it's so
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   important that you test the truth,
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:20.960]   that you don't just say, "Oh, a pastor said
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.960]   it. Oh, he's a pastor of a large
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:24.960]   church. Oh, he knows the Bible,
[00:43:24.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   he's a PhD in this subject."
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   Because this is the most
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:30.960]   effective way
[00:43:30.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   to carry out demonic work.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:36.960]   This is why it's so important
[00:43:36.960 --> 00:43:38.960]   that we pay very close attention
[00:43:38.960 --> 00:43:40.960]   to what we
[00:43:40.960 --> 00:43:42.960]   profess to believe.
[00:43:42.960 --> 00:43:46.960]   The encounter that
[00:43:46.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   Jesus has with the demon, right,
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:50.960]   where does it happen?
[00:43:50.960 --> 00:43:52.960]   The answer's
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:43:54.960]   not on my face, okay?
[00:43:54.960 --> 00:43:56.960]   Where does this demonic encounter happen?
[00:43:56.960 --> 00:43:58.960]   At the
[00:43:58.960 --> 00:44:00.960]   synagogue.
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:02.960]   At the synagogue.
[00:44:02.960 --> 00:44:04.960]   Where it happens
[00:44:04.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   was that Jesus was not walking down and he saw a demon
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:08.960]   possessed man who was doing pervert, like, crazy
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:10.960]   things, and then
[00:44:10.960 --> 00:44:12.960]   Jesus went to him, looking for him, and he says, "No."
[00:44:12.960 --> 00:44:14.960]   What was happening was
[00:44:14.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   very ordinary.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:18.960]   It was on a typical
[00:44:18.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   Sabbath. The only thing extraordinary
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:22.960]   about this event was that Jesus was there.
[00:44:22.960 --> 00:44:24.960]   And Jesus,
[00:44:24.960 --> 00:44:26.960]   when he opens up the Scriptures,
[00:44:26.960 --> 00:44:28.960]   and he begins to preach the
[00:44:28.960 --> 00:44:30.960]   adulterated Word of God,
[00:44:30.960 --> 00:44:32.960]   there was a response.
[00:44:32.960 --> 00:44:34.960]   It doesn't tell us,
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:36.960]   you know, maybe he came,
[00:44:36.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   maybe he heard about Jesus and he came to listen
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:40.960]   to Jesus, which, in my
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:42.960]   mind, that's unlikely.
[00:44:42.960 --> 00:44:44.960]   The demons are afraid of him. Why
[00:44:44.960 --> 00:44:46.960]   would they go out of their way?
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:48.960]   My guess is, this person was in
[00:44:48.960 --> 00:44:50.960]   the synagogue. He was in the community.
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.960]   And maybe they were able to
[00:44:52.960 --> 00:44:54.960]   function. Maybe he was acting strange.
[00:44:54.960 --> 00:44:56.960]   Maybe they thought, maybe he had some mental illness.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   Whatever it was,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:00.960]   he was in the synagogue.
[00:45:00.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   Part of the worship.
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:04.960]   Listening like everybody else.
[00:45:04.960 --> 00:45:06.960]   But for the first time,
[00:45:06.960 --> 00:45:08.960]   an anointed man of God opened up the
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:10.960]   Word,
[00:45:10.960 --> 00:45:12.960]   and he was stirred.
[00:45:12.960 --> 00:45:14.960]   That's where the encounter happens.
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:16.960]   Now, why is this significant?
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:18.960]   Because they didn't even recognize
[00:45:18.960 --> 00:45:20.960]   the demon among them until Christ
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:22.960]   was in their presence.
[00:45:22.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   Whether it
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:26.960]   was him or whoever else was there,
[00:45:26.960 --> 00:45:28.960]   he was there, like everybody else.
[00:45:28.960 --> 00:45:30.960]   It was only when
[00:45:30.960 --> 00:45:32.960]   Christ was revealed
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   through the Word of God
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:36.960]   the demon was stirred to speak.
[00:45:36.960 --> 00:45:38.960]   The reason why this is so significant
[00:45:38.960 --> 00:45:40.960]   is because in James 2, 18-19,
[00:45:40.960 --> 00:45:42.960]   it says, "But some
[00:45:42.960 --> 00:45:44.960]   one may say,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:46.960]   'You have faith and I have works.
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:48.960]   Show me your faith without works, and I will show you
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:50.960]   my faith by my works. You believe that
[00:45:50.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   God is one. You do well.
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:54.960]   The demons also believe and shudder.'"
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   In other words, he's saying you're professing
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:58.960]   the same thing that the demons profess.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:02.960]   What you're holding on to,
[00:46:02.960 --> 00:46:04.960]   saying that, "I believe,
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:06.960]   so therefore I must be saved."
[00:46:06.960 --> 00:46:08.960]   He said, "That's great. That's good.
[00:46:08.960 --> 00:46:10.960]   But even the demons have that,
[00:46:10.960 --> 00:46:12.960]   and they shudder."
[00:46:12.960 --> 00:46:14.960]   This demon-possessed
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:16.960]   man was in the presence, like
[00:46:16.960 --> 00:46:18.960]   everybody else,
[00:46:18.960 --> 00:46:20.960]   until Christ showed up.
[00:46:20.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   And then he was revealed.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:24.960]   It's important
[00:46:24.960 --> 00:46:26.960]   for us this morning as we examine
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:28.960]   this demonic faith.
[00:46:28.960 --> 00:46:30.960]   What is
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   the difference between this demonic faith
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:34.960]   and saving faith?
[00:46:34.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   What is the difference?
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:38.960]   Clearly it's not church attendance.
[00:46:38.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   Clearly it's not
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:42.960]   just profession. Clearly it's
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:44.960]   not just having the doctrines right.
[00:46:44.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   We're going to see that. There's three
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:48.960]   things that I want you to notice.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:50.960]   The distinction between saving faith
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   and this demonic faith. One,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:56.960]   these demons knew who Jesus was.
[00:46:56.960 --> 00:46:58.960]   They had his identity
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:00.960]   correct. Even as
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:02.960]   other people did not recognize
[00:47:02.960 --> 00:47:04.960]   him, the demons were the first ones to profess
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:06.960]   and know exactly who Jesus
[00:47:06.960 --> 00:47:08.960]   was.
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:10.960]   It says that this man
[00:47:10.960 --> 00:47:12.960]   had an unclean
[00:47:12.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   demon.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:16.960]   Every Saturday night or in the
[00:47:16.960 --> 00:47:18.960]   afternoon, I'll put up questions that
[00:47:18.960 --> 00:47:20.960]   I'm going to be covering for the next day.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:22.960]   So those of you who say, "Oh, his sermons are
[00:47:22.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   difficult to understand." Go Friday
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   night, look at the questions,
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:28.960]   and then examine the text, and
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:30.960]   that'll kind of help you to follow along
[00:47:30.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   with what I'm saying. At the minimum, you'll
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.960]   know what texts that were in. So one of the questions
[00:47:34.960 --> 00:47:36.960]   that I asked is, "Why is a demon
[00:47:36.960 --> 00:47:38.960]   called unclean? Is there a
[00:47:38.960 --> 00:47:40.960]   clean demon?"
[00:47:40.960 --> 00:47:42.960]   Is there different levels of demons
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.960]   where you have unclean demon, kind of
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   clean demon, you know,
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   little bit disorganized demon?
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   Right?
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   It's like an oxymoron. Why would you have to
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:54.960]   call him unclean? Because we already understand
[00:47:54.960 --> 00:47:56.960]   that the demon is unclean.
[00:47:56.960 --> 00:47:58.960]   I believe that Luke is doing that
[00:47:58.960 --> 00:48:00.960]   to contrast between these
[00:48:00.960 --> 00:48:02.960]   demons and who they
[00:48:02.960 --> 00:48:04.960]   recognize. Because as
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   soon as they see Jesus, what do they say? "We know
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   who you are." And they said, "You are
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:10.960]   the Holy One of God."
[00:48:10.960 --> 00:48:14.960]   They were sitting in the midst, just like everybody
[00:48:14.960 --> 00:48:16.960]   else, and my guess is maybe they didn't recognize.
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.960]   Until
[00:48:18.960 --> 00:48:20.960]   he was in the presence
[00:48:20.960 --> 00:48:22.960]   of Christ.
[00:48:22.960 --> 00:48:24.960]   And his unadulterated Word of God.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   And so Luke is trying to
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   distinguish between the Holy One of God
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.960]   and the unclean demons.
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:34.960]   I think you and I know that's exactly
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.960]   what happens when we encounter Christ.
[00:48:36.960 --> 00:48:40.960]   In fact, our justification happens because
[00:48:40.960 --> 00:48:42.960]   when we encounter Christ, we
[00:48:42.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   recognize the filth of our sin.
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:46.960]   And it is the recognition
[00:48:46.960 --> 00:48:48.960]   of the filth of our sin that
[00:48:48.960 --> 00:48:50.960]   causes us to repent.
[00:48:50.960 --> 00:48:52.960]   There are many
[00:48:52.960 --> 00:48:54.960]   in the church who have never
[00:48:54.960 --> 00:48:56.960]   acknowledged or recognized
[00:48:56.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   the sin.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   They said, "Yeah, Jesus is good.
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:02.960]   He died for my sins, and so I'm going to go to heaven,
[00:49:02.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   so I'm a Christian." But they don't
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.960]   see the depth of their sin because they've never
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   encountered Christ. And as
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:10.960]   a result of that, they can go through the motion,
[00:49:10.960 --> 00:49:12.960]   but they don't know where they stand
[00:49:12.960 --> 00:49:14.960]   before God.
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:16.960]   See, when they saw Jesus
[00:49:16.960 --> 00:49:18.960]   and they heard Jesus,
[00:49:18.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   the first thing that they recognized, "You are
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:22.960]   the Holy One of God."
[00:49:22.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   2 Corinthians 10:12 says, "For we are
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:26.960]   not bold to class or compare
[00:49:26.960 --> 00:49:28.960]   ourselves with some of those
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:30.960]   who commend themselves, but
[00:49:30.960 --> 00:49:32.960]   when they measure themselves by themselves
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:34.960]   and compare themselves with themselves,
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   they are without understanding."
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:38.960]   There are people
[00:49:38.960 --> 00:49:40.960]   who are completely
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.960]   comfortable in the church
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   because they compare themselves
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:46.960]   with other sinners.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.960]   I'm not as bad
[00:49:48.960 --> 00:49:50.960]   as that.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:52.960]   I didn't murder anybody.
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:54.960]   But they've never encountered Christ.
[00:49:54.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   Because they never encountered
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   Christ, they don't see the depravity
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:50:00.960]   of their own hearts.
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:02.960]   And so an individual
[00:50:02.960 --> 00:50:04.960]   who knows the teachings of the Bible
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:06.960]   and who have not encountered Christ
[00:50:06.960 --> 00:50:08.960]   ends up
[00:50:08.960 --> 00:50:10.960]   preoccupied with the filth of
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   other people.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:14.960]   Which was the
[00:50:14.960 --> 00:50:16.960]   Pharisees and the scribes.
[00:50:16.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   We're constantly concerned
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:20.960]   about the filth of other people.
[00:50:20.960 --> 00:50:22.960]   But they're not
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   aware of their own filth.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:26.960]   Their own uncleanness.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.960]   But one of the first things
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:30.960]   that happens to an individual who is
[00:50:30.960 --> 00:50:32.960]   in the presence of God
[00:50:32.960 --> 00:50:34.960]   continually is a recognition
[00:50:34.960 --> 00:50:36.960]   of our own unworthiness.
[00:50:36.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   Of the whole
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:40.960]   of God that we stand before
[00:50:40.960 --> 00:50:42.960]   to worship Him.
[00:50:42.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   And as a result of that, we are
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:46.960]   more concerned about our own sins than
[00:50:46.960 --> 00:50:48.960]   anybody else's sins. Because that's the closest
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:50.960]   to us.
[00:50:50.960 --> 00:50:52.960]   The sin that is the closest to us
[00:50:52.960 --> 00:50:54.960]   is not other people's sin. It is our own sin.
[00:50:54.960 --> 00:50:56.960]   I think Luke is
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   trying to distinguish
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:51:00.960]   to be
[00:51:00.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   able to recognize. That's what the demons
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:04.960]   recognized. They knew that they were standing before
[00:51:04.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   the Holy Son of God.
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:08.960]   So in Mark 3,
[00:51:08.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   11 it says, "Whenever the unclean spirit saw Him, they would
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:12.960]   fall down before Him and shout,
[00:51:12.960 --> 00:51:14.960]   'You are the Son of God!'"
[00:51:14.960 --> 00:51:16.960]   Immediately they recognized
[00:51:16.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   who He was. Luke 4, 41
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:20.960]   demons also were coming out of many
[00:51:20.960 --> 00:51:22.960]   places shouting, "You are the Son of God!"
[00:51:22.960 --> 00:51:24.960]   But rebuking them, He would not allow them to speak
[00:51:24.960 --> 00:51:26.960]   because they knew Him to be
[00:51:26.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   Christ.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.960]   The whole reason the Bible
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:32.960]   says that the law was given
[00:51:32.960 --> 00:51:34.960]   was to bring sinners
[00:51:34.960 --> 00:51:36.960]   to where the demons were.
[00:51:36.960 --> 00:51:38.960]   So they would recognize
[00:51:38.960 --> 00:51:40.960]   the utter
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:42.960]   filthiness of their own sins.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.960]   Which is what the demons
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.960]   recognized as soon as they were before God.
[00:51:46.960 --> 00:51:48.960]   It is a
[00:51:48.960 --> 00:51:50.960]   sad statement for the nation of Israel
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   that the demons
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   recognized Him, but they did not.
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:56.960]   That the
[00:51:56.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   leaders of Israel who knew
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   the law did not recognize Him.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:02.960]   The teachers of the law
[00:52:02.960 --> 00:52:04.960]   who were teaching them, Sabbath after
[00:52:04.960 --> 00:52:06.960]   Sabbath after Sabbath, and yet the Messiah
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   that they've been proclaiming
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   for years and years and years
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.960]   standing right before them,
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   and they didn't recognize Him.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   But the demons did.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:18.960]   You
[00:52:18.960 --> 00:52:20.960]   remember Isaiah chapter 6 verse 5?
[00:52:20.960 --> 00:52:22.960]   God is trying to prepare
[00:52:22.960 --> 00:52:24.960]   Isaiah for ministry.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:26.960]   And so this righteous man of Israel
[00:52:26.960 --> 00:52:28.960]   is being anointed
[00:52:28.960 --> 00:52:30.960]   to proclaim His Word.
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   And so
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:34.960]   God brings Him and
[00:52:34.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   shows Him His glory.
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.960]   And this righteous man of Israel,
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:40.960]   when he sees the glory
[00:52:40.960 --> 00:52:42.960]   of God, he says,
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.960]   Isaiah 6 verse 5, "Then I said, 'Woe
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:46.960]   to me, for I am ruined,
[00:52:46.960 --> 00:52:48.960]   because I am a man
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   of unclean lips, and I live among a people
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:52.960]   of unclean lips, for my eyes have seen
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.960]   the King, the Lord of hosts.'"
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:58.960]   Genuine encounter
[00:52:58.960 --> 00:53:00.960]   with the Holy God exposes
[00:53:00.960 --> 00:53:02.960]   who we are in the
[00:53:02.960 --> 00:53:04.960]   light of who He is.
[00:53:04.960 --> 00:53:06.960]   Remember that.
[00:53:06.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   The demons recognized Him.
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:10.960]   And that's what He means.
[00:53:10.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   He said, "Well, we recognize
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   Him. Oh yeah, I believe that Jesus
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:16.960]   is God." Good.
[00:53:16.960 --> 00:53:18.960]   Even the demons believe that.
[00:53:18.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   "Oh yeah, I believe in, you know,
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:22.960]   what He came to do." Demons knew that.
[00:53:22.960 --> 00:53:24.960]   They believed that.
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.960]   "You're good. You're from God."
[00:53:26.960 --> 00:53:28.960]   Good. That's correct.
[00:53:28.960 --> 00:53:30.960]   But the demons believed that.
[00:53:30.960 --> 00:53:34.960]   Second, they
[00:53:34.960 --> 00:53:36.960]   immediately recognized Jesus' authority
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:38.960]   over them. It wasn't just an impersonal.
[00:53:38.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   Like, "Oh, I know who
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:42.960]   you are." It was very personal.
[00:53:42.960 --> 00:53:44.960]   They recognized His authority.
[00:53:44.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   "Let us alone have you come to destroy
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.960]   us." They knew exactly where they stood.
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:50.960]   They recognized their filth in the
[00:53:50.960 --> 00:53:52.960]   presence of a Holy God. But you know
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   what's interesting?
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   In the Old Testament, there is no
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:58.960]   record of any casting
[00:53:58.960 --> 00:54:00.960]   out of demons.
[00:54:00.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   That doesn't happen until Jesus comes.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   And then we have all
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   these records in the Gospel ministry where
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:08.960]   Jesus is walking, and there's all
[00:54:08.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   these demonic encounters
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   when Jesus appears.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:14.960]   So you don't see that until Jesus
[00:54:14.960 --> 00:54:16.960]   comes in the Gospels.
[00:54:16.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   And there's a clear reason for that.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:20.960]   Because the Bible says in 2 Corinthians 4:4,
[00:54:20.960 --> 00:54:22.960]   "Satan is the god of this age."
[00:54:22.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   Now,
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:26.960]   in the Bible, in the Greek,
[00:54:26.960 --> 00:54:28.960]   there's two different words used for the world.
[00:54:28.960 --> 00:54:30.960]   One is "cosmos."
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:32.960]   Again, it's not the totality of this meaning,
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.960]   but the word "cosmos" basically means
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:36.960]   the creation. What has been created
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:38.960]   is "cosmos." The word that is used here
[00:54:38.960 --> 00:54:40.960]   is "ion."
[00:54:40.960 --> 00:54:42.960]   It's referring to culture, or the
[00:54:42.960 --> 00:54:44.960]   age.
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:46.960]   So when he says, "Satan is the god of this
[00:54:46.960 --> 00:54:48.960]   ion, this age," he's talking about
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:50.960]   its values.
[00:54:50.960 --> 00:54:52.960]   He's talking about the
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   things that we're tempted by, things that we
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:56.960]   pursue.
[00:54:56.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   And so he said, "Satan
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:00.960]   has free reign," because
[00:55:00.960 --> 00:55:02.960]   that's his domain. Now,
[00:55:02.960 --> 00:55:04.960]   let me get very personal here.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:06.960]   Okay?
[00:55:06.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   What that means is
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:10.960]   K-pop is not neutral.
[00:55:10.960 --> 00:55:16.960]   K-pop is not neutral.
[00:55:16.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   Hollywood is not neutral.
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:22.960]   Politics is not neutral.
[00:55:22.960 --> 00:55:24.960]   Education
[00:55:24.960 --> 00:55:26.960]   is not neutral.
[00:55:26.960 --> 00:55:28.960]   It's not neutral.
[00:55:28.960 --> 00:55:30.960]   All of it is under
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:32.960]   the power of the god of this
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:34.960]   age, ion.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:36.960]   So, if we think there's a realm
[00:55:36.960 --> 00:55:38.960]   of god, and then there's a realm of
[00:55:38.960 --> 00:55:40.960]   the devil, and then there's a large
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:42.960]   part that's neutral.
[00:55:42.960 --> 00:55:44.960]   No.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:46.960]   They're either under the domain of Satan
[00:55:46.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   or under the kingdom of his son.
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:50.960]   And that's why
[00:55:50.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   we have to stay sober and alert,
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:54.960]   because there are
[00:55:54.960 --> 00:55:56.960]   deliberate influences
[00:55:56.960 --> 00:55:58.960]   in our culture
[00:55:58.960 --> 00:56:00.960]   to get you to think and
[00:56:00.960 --> 00:56:02.960]   to act like
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:04.960]   children of the devil.
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:06.960]   And if we're not careful,
[00:56:06.960 --> 00:56:08.960]   we get slowly sucked up into that
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:10.960]   in the way that we're
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.960]   thinking that is completely
[00:56:12.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   demonic.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:16.960]   This...
[00:56:16.960 --> 00:56:18.960]   Satan had free
[00:56:18.960 --> 00:56:20.960]   reign until Christ appears, and then
[00:56:20.960 --> 00:56:22.960]   they are trembling. In Acts 6, 26,
[00:56:22.960 --> 00:56:24.960]   18, it says, "To open their eyes so that
[00:56:24.960 --> 00:56:26.960]   they may turn from darkness to light, and from the
[00:56:26.960 --> 00:56:28.960]   dominion of Satan to God,
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:30.960]   that they may receive forgiveness of sins and
[00:56:30.960 --> 00:56:32.960]   inheritance among those who have been sanctified
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:34.960]   by faith in me." Notice here
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   there's only two dominions, dominion of Satan
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:38.960]   and dominion of God.
[00:56:38.960 --> 00:56:40.960]   You don't have your own dominion.
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:42.960]   You don't
[00:56:42.960 --> 00:56:44.960]   have your own dominion.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.960]   Either you are being influenced by God,
[00:56:46.960 --> 00:56:48.960]   or you're being influenced by the demonic
[00:56:48.960 --> 00:56:50.960]   world.
[00:56:50.960 --> 00:56:52.960]   Colossians 1, 13,
[00:56:52.960 --> 00:56:54.960]   "For he rescued
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:56.960]   us from the domain of darkness." The word
[00:56:56.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   domain is the same word that we
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:00.960]   understood when they heard the word
[00:57:00.960 --> 00:57:02.960]   of God, he spoke with authority,
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:04.960]   and that's that same word here.
[00:57:04.960 --> 00:57:06.960]   He said, "He rescued us from the
[00:57:06.960 --> 00:57:08.960]   authority of darkness and transferred
[00:57:08.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   us to the kingdom of his beloved
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:12.960]   Son." You are either
[00:57:12.960 --> 00:57:14.960]   in the kingdom of darkness or the kingdom
[00:57:14.960 --> 00:57:16.960]   of his Son.
[00:57:16.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   Hebrews 2, 14, "Therefore,
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:20.960]   since the children share in the flesh and blood,
[00:57:20.960 --> 00:57:22.960]   he himself likewise also partook of the same,
[00:57:22.960 --> 00:57:24.960]   that through death he might render
[00:57:24.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   powerless him who had the power of death,
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   that is, the devil."
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:30.960]   Think about
[00:57:30.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   the fear of death
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:34.960]   and how that affects what we do
[00:57:34.960 --> 00:57:36.960]   and what we value.
[00:57:36.960 --> 00:57:38.960]   And he said, "The power of death is sin,
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.960]   and the power
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:42.960]   that has authority
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   over that," he said, "is the
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   devil. The devil has that."
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:48.960]   And so the devil was, Satan
[00:57:48.960 --> 00:57:50.960]   was reigning freely
[00:57:50.960 --> 00:57:52.960]   until the true
[00:57:52.960 --> 00:57:54.960]   authority comes.
[00:57:54.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   And so they recognized him right away.
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:57:58.960]   Up to this point,
[00:57:58.960 --> 00:58:00.960]   the demons did whatever they wanted.
[00:58:00.960 --> 00:58:02.960]   They possessed whoever they wanted
[00:58:02.960 --> 00:58:04.960]   because they were all under
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:06.960]   his domain. Then all of a
[00:58:06.960 --> 00:58:08.960]   sudden, the king of kings
[00:58:08.960 --> 00:58:10.960]   and lord of lords shows up,
[00:58:10.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   and they said, "Why have you come?"
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.960]   They had recognized his
[00:58:14.960 --> 00:58:16.960]   authority. In fact, Jesus,
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:18.960]   when he hears the devil, the demon,
[00:58:18.960 --> 00:58:20.960]   he says, "Be quiet and come out."
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:22.960]   "Be quiet" is more
[00:58:22.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   of a tame version. The word should be
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:26.960]   "shut up."
[00:58:26.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   You probably never heard that from a puppet
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:30.960]   before, but you heard it this morning.
[00:58:30.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   The literal translation is, "Shut your mouth."
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:34.960]   Jesus was not
[00:58:34.960 --> 00:58:36.960]   being polite with the demons.
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   He was saying, "Shut your mouth.
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:40.960]   Come out of him."
[00:58:40.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   There's no discussion.
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:44.960]   There's no debate.
[00:58:44.960 --> 00:58:46.960]   Jesus doesn't reason with him.
[00:58:46.960 --> 00:58:48.960]   He doesn't say, "Hey, do you think that's
[00:58:48.960 --> 00:58:50.960]   the best thing? You think
[00:58:50.960 --> 00:58:52.960]   what you're doing is wise?
[00:58:52.960 --> 00:58:54.960]   Don't you know what's going to happen to you
[00:58:54.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   after you die, or after all of this?"
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:58:58.960]   He doesn't reason with him. He just says, "Shut up!"
[00:58:58.960 --> 00:59:00.960]   And
[00:59:00.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   the demons were not saying anything blasphemous.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:04.960]   The demons
[00:59:04.960 --> 00:59:06.960]   were speaking the truth.
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:08.960]   We know
[00:59:08.960 --> 00:59:10.960]   who you are, the son of God, the
[00:59:10.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   holy one of God.
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:14.960]   Have you come before time
[00:59:14.960 --> 00:59:16.960]   to destroy us?" He says, "Shut
[00:59:16.960 --> 00:59:18.960]   up!
[00:59:18.960 --> 00:59:20.960]   Come out!"
[00:59:20.960 --> 00:59:22.960]   And you notice the response?
[00:59:22.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   "And when the demons had thrown
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.960]   him down in the midst of the people, he came
[00:59:26.960 --> 00:59:28.960]   out of him without doing him any
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:30.960]   harm. An amazement
[00:59:30.960 --> 00:59:32.960]   came upon them all. They began talking with one
[00:59:32.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   another, saying, 'What is this message? For with authority
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:36.960]   and power, he commands the unclean spirits,
[00:59:36.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   and they come out.'"
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:40.960]   You notice how the demons don't talk back
[00:59:40.960 --> 00:59:42.960]   to him either?
[00:59:42.960 --> 00:59:44.960]   These are demons who are already
[00:59:44.960 --> 00:59:46.960]   under rebellion against God. Why don't they say, "Well, who are
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   you to tell me what to do? Satan is our
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:50.960]   master!
[00:59:50.960 --> 00:59:52.960]   We have dominion over this man!
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.960]   Nothing!"
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:56.960]   Jesus says, "Come out. Shut your mouth and come out."
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.960]   And he
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   couldn't touch him, even the demons.
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:02.960]   Even
[01:00:02.960 --> 01:00:04.960]   the demons couldn't resist a direct command.
[01:00:04.960 --> 01:00:06.960]   You know, we have this view,
[01:00:06.960 --> 01:00:08.960]   because of Hollywood,
[01:00:08.960 --> 01:00:10.960]   that you have God who is good, Satan
[01:00:10.960 --> 01:00:12.960]   who is bad, and they're kind of fighting, and we're
[01:00:12.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   rooting for Jesus, because
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:16.960]   we're on his side.
[01:00:16.960 --> 01:00:18.960]   Hopefully that he will be
[01:00:18.960 --> 01:00:20.960]   powerful enough, if we pray enough, if we
[01:00:20.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   work hard enough, if we share the gospel enough,
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   if we disciple
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:26.960]   enough, that Jesus will be established
[01:00:26.960 --> 01:00:28.960]   and Satan will lose.
[01:00:28.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   That's not how the Bible describes
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:32.960]   Satanic power.
[01:00:32.960 --> 01:00:34.960]   Even the demons in the
[01:00:34.960 --> 01:00:36.960]   presence of Jesus
[01:00:36.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   were shuddering in fear.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:40.960]   They don't argue
[01:00:40.960 --> 01:00:42.960]   with him, they don't debate with him,
[01:00:42.960 --> 01:00:44.960]   they just come out.
[01:00:44.960 --> 01:00:46.960]   And the reason why they say they didn't
[01:00:46.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   touch him, that they didn't harm him, is because that's
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:50.960]   their normal pattern, because they want to destroy.
[01:00:50.960 --> 01:00:52.960]   But
[01:00:52.960 --> 01:00:54.960]   because Jesus said, "Come out," and they didn't give
[01:00:54.960 --> 01:00:56.960]   any stipulation, they obeyed exactly
[01:00:56.960 --> 01:00:58.960]   what Jesus said.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:00.960]   Now, why is this significant?
[01:01:00.960 --> 01:01:02.960]   Because
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:04.960]   even the demons
[01:01:04.960 --> 01:01:06.960]   cannot resist a direct command.
[01:01:06.960 --> 01:01:08.960]   Think
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:10.960]   about that.
[01:01:10.960 --> 01:01:12.960]   These are demons.
[01:01:12.960 --> 01:01:14.960]   Now, were they
[01:01:14.960 --> 01:01:16.960]   in obedience to God? Of course not. They're in
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.960]   rebellion against him. But a direct
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:20.960]   command of God, even the demons couldn't resist.
[01:01:20.960 --> 01:01:24.960]   How many
[01:01:24.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   Christians, proclaiming Christians, who live
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   in rebellion against God's direct
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:32.960]   command
[01:01:32.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   and have
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:36.960]   absolute security because I
[01:01:36.960 --> 01:01:38.960]   confessed something somewhere in the past?
[01:01:38.960 --> 01:01:40.960]   Because I
[01:01:40.960 --> 01:01:42.960]   know who he is. I believe he's Jesus.
[01:01:42.960 --> 01:01:44.960]   I have absolute security.
[01:01:44.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   Even the
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:48.960]   demons couldn't resist him.
[01:01:48.960 --> 01:01:50.960]   Third,
[01:01:50.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   the demons
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:54.960]   were terrified.
[01:01:54.960 --> 01:01:56.960]   In Matthew 8,
[01:01:56.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   29,
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:00.960]   these two violent
[01:02:00.960 --> 01:02:02.960]   demons who possess
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   these two men, they were so violent
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:06.960]   that people could not even pass by where they were
[01:02:06.960 --> 01:02:08.960]   because they were going to get jumped by these demons.
[01:02:08.960 --> 01:02:10.960]   These powerful demons who
[01:02:10.960 --> 01:02:12.960]   control these two men. So Jesus shows up
[01:02:12.960 --> 01:02:14.960]   and they are in fear. In verse 29 it says,
[01:02:14.960 --> 01:02:16.960]   "And they cried out, saying, 'What business do we
[01:02:16.960 --> 01:02:18.960]   have with each other, Son of God? Have you come
[01:02:18.960 --> 01:02:20.960]   here to torment us before the time?'"
[01:02:20.960 --> 01:02:22.960]   There's no arguing.
[01:02:22.960 --> 01:02:24.960]   They don't try to wrestle with him. As soon as they recognize
[01:02:24.960 --> 01:02:26.960]   him, they are in fear.
[01:02:26.960 --> 01:02:28.960]   And Jesus says to come
[01:02:28.960 --> 01:02:30.960]   out. And they beg him,
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:32.960]   'Please allow us at least to destroy
[01:02:32.960 --> 01:02:34.960]   the swines
[01:02:34.960 --> 01:02:36.960]   because that's who they are.'
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:38.960]   He said,
[01:02:38.960 --> 01:02:40.960]   and he gives them permission.
[01:02:40.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   They said, 'Why did Jesus do that?
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:46.960]   What was the purpose of
[01:02:46.960 --> 01:02:48.960]   allowing them to go into the swines and destroy the swines?
[01:02:48.960 --> 01:02:50.960]   Well,
[01:02:50.960 --> 01:02:52.960]   what do we learn from that?
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:54.960]   That's who they are.
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:56.960]   That's what they are.
[01:02:56.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   That's what demons want to do.
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.960]   But he wouldn't permit them to do it to the
[01:03:00.960 --> 01:03:02.960]   human beings. So to show us
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   that this is the nature of
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:06.960]   these demons, he allows it.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.960]   So now we have on record
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:10.960]   visually that this is what
[01:03:10.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   they want to do to us.
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.960]   And Jesus wouldn't
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:18.960]   permit it.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:20.960]   And they were in fear.
[01:03:20.960 --> 01:03:22.960]   Mark 5:7
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:24.960]   "At the tomb of the garrison,"
[01:03:24.960 --> 01:03:26.960]   it says, "and shouting
[01:03:26.960 --> 01:03:28.960]   with a loud voice, he said, 'What business
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:30.960]   do we have with each other? Jesus,
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.960]   Son of the Most High God, I implore
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:34.960]   you by God, do not torment me.'"
[01:03:34.960 --> 01:03:36.960]   They're not fighting against
[01:03:36.960 --> 01:03:38.960]   him. They're not arguing against him. They're just
[01:03:38.960 --> 01:03:40.960]   in fear. And then Matthew 25, 41,
[01:03:40.960 --> 01:03:42.960]   Jesus says, "And he will also say to
[01:03:42.960 --> 01:03:44.960]   those on his left, 'Depart from me, you cursed
[01:03:44.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   ones, into the eternal fire which
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   has been prepared for the devil and his
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:50.960]   angels.'"
[01:03:50.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   And you know who knew this
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:54.960]   better than anybody else? The demons.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   They knew.
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:58.960]   Which is the crazy thing about
[01:03:58.960 --> 01:04:00.960]   the demons, that knowing that
[01:04:00.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   torment is coming.
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:04.960]   Knowing
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:06.960]   that torment is coming. And as crazy
[01:04:06.960 --> 01:04:08.960]   as that is, that's exactly what it
[01:04:08.960 --> 01:04:10.960]   says in the book of Revelation.
[01:04:10.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   When God is revealed and judgment
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   comes, the people who are
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:16.960]   rebelling against God, instead of
[01:04:16.960 --> 01:04:18.960]   falling to their knees and repenting,
[01:04:18.960 --> 01:04:20.960]   they go into the caves to
[01:04:20.960 --> 01:04:22.960]   hide from him without
[01:04:22.960 --> 01:04:24.960]   repenting. And they harden
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:26.960]   their hearts even further.
[01:04:26.960 --> 01:04:28.960]   And the demons
[01:04:28.960 --> 01:04:30.960]   knew this very well.
[01:04:30.960 --> 01:04:32.960]   And as soon as they were in the presence
[01:04:32.960 --> 01:04:34.960]   of the Holy One of God,
[01:04:34.960 --> 01:04:36.960]   "Have you come
[01:04:36.960 --> 01:04:38.960]   before your time?"
[01:04:38.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   It's because the demons
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:42.960]   knew, and because
[01:04:42.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   they had the right theology,
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:46.960]   that's why they were terrified.
[01:04:46.960 --> 01:04:48.960]   Now,
[01:04:48.960 --> 01:04:50.960]   why is this so important for us?
[01:04:50.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   Because in
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:54.960]   Psalm 36, verse 1, it says, "Transgression
[01:04:54.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   speaks to the ungodly with his heart.
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:04:58.960]   There is no fear of God before
[01:04:58.960 --> 01:05:00.960]   his eyes."
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:02.960]   Those who are comfortable
[01:05:02.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   in sin, it's because they
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:06.960]   do not fear God.
[01:05:06.960 --> 01:05:08.960]   He says,
[01:05:08.960 --> 01:05:10.960]   "You have right theology. Good!
[01:05:10.960 --> 01:05:12.960]   Even the demons have that.
[01:05:12.960 --> 01:05:14.960]   But you know what the demons have that even you
[01:05:14.960 --> 01:05:16.960]   don't have?
[01:05:16.960 --> 01:05:18.960]   They are afraid."
[01:05:20.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   They are afraid. And he said, "The reason why
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:24.960]   people continue to live in sin and profess
[01:05:24.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   to know God is because they really don't
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:28.960]   know God.
[01:05:28.960 --> 01:05:30.960]   That their faith isn't better than the demons, it's actually
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:32.960]   worse than the demons.
[01:05:32.960 --> 01:05:34.960]   Because they profess
[01:05:34.960 --> 01:05:36.960]   to know this Holy, Holy, Holy God
[01:05:36.960 --> 01:05:38.960]   and live in rebellion
[01:05:38.960 --> 01:05:40.960]   against God, and there is no fear.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:44.960]   There is no fear.
[01:05:44.960 --> 01:05:46.960]   And the reason why, you know
[01:05:46.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   how that happened? Through the
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:50.960]   pulpit.
[01:05:50.960 --> 01:05:52.960]   That deception happened through the pulpit.
[01:05:52.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   Because men who are more
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   afraid of men
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:00.960]   have come into ministry
[01:06:00.960 --> 01:06:04.960]   and perverted the gospel
[01:06:04.960 --> 01:06:06.960]   for their own gain.
[01:06:06.960 --> 01:06:08.960]   And so the work of the devil came
[01:06:08.960 --> 01:06:10.960]   through the pulpit by
[01:06:10.960 --> 01:06:12.960]   compromising the Word of God.
[01:06:12.960 --> 01:06:14.960]   And so we have a generation filled with people
[01:06:14.960 --> 01:06:16.960]   living in rebellion against God
[01:06:16.960 --> 01:06:18.960]   and be fully
[01:06:18.960 --> 01:06:20.960]   convinced that when they
[01:06:20.960 --> 01:06:22.960]   meet this Holy God
[01:06:22.960 --> 01:06:24.960]   that they are perfectly safe.
[01:06:24.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   Even though the demons
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   believe and they shudder.
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:32.960]   They believe that because they don't know the Word of God.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   They are not,
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   there is no fear of God because they
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   do not know this God.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:40.960]   It is the same God
[01:06:40.960 --> 01:06:42.960]   who destroyed the world because
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:44.960]   He was ignited in
[01:06:44.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   judgment.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:50.960]   He wiped out the whole earth
[01:06:50.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   with the exception of eight
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:06:54.960]   because He was so
[01:06:54.960 --> 01:06:56.960]   provoked by their sins.
[01:06:56.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   And the Bible tells us that's exactly how the world
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:02.960]   will end. He will separate
[01:07:02.960 --> 01:07:04.960]   the sheep and the goat. Many will say to me,
[01:07:04.960 --> 01:07:06.960]   "Lord, Lord."
[01:07:06.960 --> 01:07:08.960]   And He says,
[01:07:08.960 --> 01:07:10.960]   "You have been deceived.
[01:07:10.960 --> 01:07:12.960]   You have had demonic
[01:07:12.960 --> 01:07:14.960]   faith and you
[01:07:14.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   have been lied to.
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:18.960]   And so you have been destroyed
[01:07:18.960 --> 01:07:20.960]   and devoured."
[01:07:20.960 --> 01:07:26.960]   Romans 3, 10-18.
[01:07:26.960 --> 01:07:28.960]   It is the description
[01:07:28.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   of man's rebellion.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:32.960]   And I'm not going to read all of it.
[01:07:32.960 --> 01:07:34.960]   But He
[01:07:34.960 --> 01:07:36.960]   lists these things to convince
[01:07:36.960 --> 01:07:38.960]   us that we are desperately
[01:07:38.960 --> 01:07:40.960]   in need of His mercy.
[01:07:40.960 --> 01:07:42.960]   And I'm going to start reading from verse 14.
[01:07:42.960 --> 01:07:44.960]   It says, "Whose mouth is full of cursing and bitterness.
[01:07:44.960 --> 01:07:46.960]   Their feet are swift to shed blood.
[01:07:46.960 --> 01:07:48.960]   Destruction and misery are in their path.
[01:07:48.960 --> 01:07:50.960]   And the path of peace they have not
[01:07:50.960 --> 01:07:52.960]   known. There is no fear
[01:07:52.960 --> 01:07:54.960]   of God before their eyes."
[01:07:54.960 --> 01:07:58.960]   Basically, that's a summary of everything that He said.
[01:07:58.960 --> 01:08:00.960]   The reason why they are completely
[01:08:00.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   safe in rebellion against God
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:04.960]   is because there is no fear of God
[01:08:04.960 --> 01:08:06.960]   in them. Proverbs 8, 13.
[01:08:06.960 --> 01:08:08.960]   The fear of the Lord is to
[01:08:08.960 --> 01:08:10.960]   hate evil. Fear of the Lord
[01:08:10.960 --> 01:08:12.960]   is to hate evil. Pride and arrogance and
[01:08:12.960 --> 01:08:14.960]   evil way and the perverted mouth
[01:08:14.960 --> 01:08:16.960]   I hate.
[01:08:16.960 --> 01:08:18.960]   I hate. Proverbs 16, 6.
[01:08:18.960 --> 01:08:20.960]   "By loving kindness and truth
[01:08:20.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   iniquity is atoned for."
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:24.960]   Right? I want you to pay
[01:08:24.960 --> 01:08:26.960]   attention to that. "By loving kindness and truth iniquity
[01:08:26.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   is atoned for. And by the fear
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:30.960]   of the Lord one keeps away from evil."
[01:08:30.960 --> 01:08:34.960]   Look at that passage
[01:08:34.960 --> 01:08:36.960]   carefully.
[01:08:36.960 --> 01:08:38.960]   "By loving kindness
[01:08:38.960 --> 01:08:40.960]   and truth iniquity is atoned for."
[01:08:40.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   It is this mercy that lays us to
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:44.960]   repentance. And it is
[01:08:44.960 --> 01:08:46.960]   the fear of the Lord that keeps us away from
[01:08:46.960 --> 01:08:48.960]   evil.
[01:08:48.960 --> 01:08:50.960]   We have a generation
[01:08:50.960 --> 01:08:52.960]   filled with people who have emphasized
[01:08:52.960 --> 01:08:54.960]   the love and kindness of God to the extent
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   exclusion
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:08:58.960]   of who God is
[01:08:58.960 --> 01:09:00.960]   in His nature.
[01:09:00.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   And this is the reason
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:04.960]   why hell is being erased
[01:09:04.960 --> 01:09:06.960]   in our generation. Because the God
[01:09:06.960 --> 01:09:08.960]   in the gospel that was priest in our generation
[01:09:08.960 --> 01:09:10.960]   does not allow hell.
[01:09:10.960 --> 01:09:12.960]   How can a loving God do
[01:09:12.960 --> 01:09:14.960]   that? How can a gracious God do that?
[01:09:14.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   So the God of our generation
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:18.960]   is a grandfather
[01:09:18.960 --> 01:09:20.960]   or grandparent
[01:09:20.960 --> 01:09:22.960]   who is spoiling a child.
[01:09:22.960 --> 01:09:26.960]   And so we have a Christian generation
[01:09:26.960 --> 01:09:28.960]   of people where the gospel and the word of God
[01:09:28.960 --> 01:09:30.960]   through the pulpit
[01:09:30.960 --> 01:09:32.960]   has come to believe
[01:09:32.960 --> 01:09:34.960]   that nothing you do matters.
[01:09:34.960 --> 01:09:36.960]   Nothing you do matters.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:38.960]   That God saved you from the consequences
[01:09:38.960 --> 01:09:40.960]   of sins. But the power
[01:09:40.960 --> 01:09:42.960]   of sin? He doesn't really care.
[01:09:42.960 --> 01:09:44.960]   Because He covers us. That's what
[01:09:44.960 --> 01:09:46.960]   love is.
[01:09:46.960 --> 01:09:48.960]   And so hell doesn't fit.
[01:09:48.960 --> 01:09:50.960]   Judgment doesn't fit.
[01:09:50.960 --> 01:09:52.960]   Holiness does not fit.
[01:09:52.960 --> 01:09:54.960]   And we have people
[01:09:54.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   more than willing to
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:09:58.960]   take that off the pulpit.
[01:09:58.960 --> 01:10:00.960]   Because our generation
[01:10:00.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   eats that up.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:04.960]   It is the fear of the Lord
[01:10:04.960 --> 01:10:06.960]   that keeps us from sin, it says.
[01:10:06.960 --> 01:10:08.960]   Ecclesiastes 12, 13.
[01:10:08.960 --> 01:10:10.960]   The conclusion,
[01:10:10.960 --> 01:10:12.960]   Solomon at the end of his life, the wisest
[01:10:12.960 --> 01:10:14.960]   human being that has ever lived
[01:10:14.960 --> 01:10:16.960]   outside of Christ,
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:18.960]   the conclusion when all has been heard
[01:10:18.960 --> 01:10:20.960]   is fear God and keep His commandment
[01:10:20.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   because this applies
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:24.960]   to every person.
[01:10:24.960 --> 01:10:26.960]   Let me conclude
[01:10:26.960 --> 01:10:28.960]   with this.
[01:10:28.960 --> 01:10:30.960]   Everything that I mentioned to you right now
[01:10:30.960 --> 01:10:32.960]   was demonic.
[01:10:32.960 --> 01:10:34.960]   It was demonic.
[01:10:34.960 --> 01:10:36.960]   They recognized
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:38.960]   Him.
[01:10:38.960 --> 01:10:40.960]   They professed the right
[01:10:40.960 --> 01:10:42.960]   identity of Christ.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:44.960]   They knew exactly what He came to do.
[01:10:44.960 --> 01:10:46.960]   And they
[01:10:46.960 --> 01:10:48.960]   knew they were guilty.
[01:10:48.960 --> 01:10:50.960]   And they were in terror of Him.
[01:10:50.960 --> 01:10:52.960]   And yet
[01:10:52.960 --> 01:10:54.960]   they will be in hell.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:10:58.960]   How many people
[01:10:58.960 --> 01:11:00.960]   in our generation have demonic faith
[01:11:00.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   and are
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:04.960]   perfectly safe
[01:11:04.960 --> 01:11:06.960]   because of the perversion of the
[01:11:06.960 --> 01:11:08.960]   truth that came through the pulpit?
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:12.960]   That's why the Bible tells us
[01:11:12.960 --> 01:11:14.960]   do not lay hands
[01:11:14.960 --> 01:11:16.960]   hastily.
[01:11:16.960 --> 01:11:18.960]   Not only
[01:11:18.960 --> 01:11:20.960]   will they be guilty, but those who
[01:11:20.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   hastily put people up on the pulpit
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:24.960]   will be guilty of the
[01:11:24.960 --> 01:11:26.960]   sin that they commit.
[01:11:26.960 --> 01:11:30.960]   I pray that this is
[01:11:30.960 --> 01:11:32.960]   sobering to all of us as it is to me.
[01:11:32.960 --> 01:11:34.960]   How the
[01:11:34.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   demonic possessed man was in the synagogue
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:38.960]   like everybody else.
[01:11:38.960 --> 01:11:40.960]   How he was doing what
[01:11:40.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   everybody else was doing until Christ showed up.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:44.960]   Until Christ
[01:11:44.960 --> 01:11:46.960]   showed up.
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:48.960]   And this is why Jesus tells us
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:50.960]   that wheat and the tares are so hard
[01:11:50.960 --> 01:11:52.960]   to separate
[01:11:52.960 --> 01:11:54.960]   because it is not obvious.
[01:11:54.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   That's how clever
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:11:58.960]   the demons are.
[01:11:58.960 --> 01:12:00.960]   That's how powerful they are.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:02.960]   That's how easily they can
[01:12:02.960 --> 01:12:04.960]   deceive. So if
[01:12:04.960 --> 01:12:06.960]   there's anybody in this room
[01:12:06.960 --> 01:12:10.960]   has hung their hat
[01:12:10.960 --> 01:12:12.960]   on something that you have heard,
[01:12:12.960 --> 01:12:14.960]   you can dismiss me, "Hey, Pastor Peter's always
[01:12:14.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   angry." You can dismiss me,
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:18.960]   but what
[01:12:18.960 --> 01:12:20.960]   are you going to do with the Word of God?
[01:12:20.960 --> 01:12:22.960]   What are you going to
[01:12:22.960 --> 01:12:24.960]   do with the passage?
[01:12:24.960 --> 01:12:26.960]   What are you going to do with what you have heard?
[01:12:26.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   I pray
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:30.960]   that even if there's one person in this
[01:12:30.960 --> 01:12:32.960]   room, whether it's
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.960]   five years, ten years, or fifty years,
[01:12:34.960 --> 01:12:38.960]   that your faith looks like the demonic
[01:12:38.960 --> 01:12:40.960]   faith.
[01:12:40.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   That you would come
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:44.960]   to the Lord
[01:12:44.960 --> 01:12:46.960]   and receive true food,
[01:12:46.960 --> 01:12:48.960]   true salvation,
[01:12:48.960 --> 01:12:50.960]   with true repentance.
[01:12:50.960 --> 01:12:54.960]   Let's pray.
[01:12:54.960 --> 01:13:04.960]   Let's take some time
[01:13:04.960 --> 01:13:06.960]   to come before the Lord.
[01:13:06.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   And anything that was said,
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:12.960]   and it's just my personality,
[01:13:12.960 --> 01:13:14.960]   it's just my hobby horse,
[01:13:14.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   that God would take that away,
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:18.960]   but the truth of
[01:13:18.960 --> 01:13:20.960]   His Word would remain in you.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:24.960]   That as Christ
[01:13:24.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   compassionately
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:28.960]   invited all of us,
[01:13:28.960 --> 01:13:30.960]   "Come to me, all who are weary
[01:13:30.960 --> 01:13:32.960]   and heavy laden."
[01:13:32.960 --> 01:13:36.960]   If you've been running to the
[01:13:36.960 --> 01:13:38.960]   world and things because
[01:13:38.960 --> 01:13:40.960]   you're heavy laden,
[01:13:40.960 --> 01:13:42.960]   and you've been eating the food of the world,
[01:13:42.960 --> 01:13:44.960]   come to Christ.
[01:13:44.960 --> 01:13:46.960]   Meet Christ.
[01:13:46.960 --> 01:13:48.960]   Submit to Christ.
[01:13:48.960 --> 01:13:52.960]   He said that He had come to give life,
[01:13:52.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   and to give this life abundantly.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:13:56.960]   There is no life
[01:13:56.960 --> 01:13:58.960]   outside of Christ.
[01:13:58.960 --> 01:14:00.960]   Come to Him.
[01:14:00.960 --> 01:14:02.960]   Repent.
[01:14:02.960 --> 01:14:04.960]   Ask for forgiveness.
[01:14:04.960 --> 01:14:06.960]   And embrace the love and life
[01:14:06.960 --> 01:14:08.960]   of Christ that can only
[01:14:08.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   come when His blood has
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:12.960]   covered us.
[01:14:12.960 --> 01:14:14.960]   And for the rest of us,
[01:14:14.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   if we've been living
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:18.960]   casually,
[01:14:18.960 --> 01:14:20.960]   trying to be in between two worlds,
[01:14:20.960 --> 01:14:22.960]   though you are one way on Sunday and another way
[01:14:22.960 --> 01:14:24.960]   on the weekdays,
[01:14:24.960 --> 01:14:26.960]   there is no middle ground.
[01:14:26.960 --> 01:14:28.960]   Either we
[01:14:28.960 --> 01:14:30.960]   are being influenced by the kingdom of the world,
[01:14:30.960 --> 01:14:32.960]   kingdom of Satan, or we are
[01:14:32.960 --> 01:14:34.960]   under the kingdom of Christ.
[01:14:34.960 --> 01:14:36.960]   Choose you this
[01:14:36.960 --> 01:14:38.960]   day whom you will serve.
[01:14:38.960 --> 01:14:40.960]   Let's take some time to
[01:14:40.960 --> 01:14:42.960]   pray again as our worship team leads us.

[01:21:45.180 --> 01:21:51.180]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[01:21:51.180 --> 01:21:55.180]   Lord, you know how easily we get entangled
[01:21:55.180 --> 01:21:56.180]   with civilian affairs.
[01:21:57.180 --> 01:22:00.180]   Help us, Lord God, live a life truly worthy
[01:22:00.180 --> 01:22:02.180]   of the gospel that you've given us.
[01:22:02.180 --> 01:22:06.180]   To live up to the calling that you have freely given to us.
[01:22:06.180 --> 01:22:09.180]   Help us to recognize the domain of darkness
[01:22:09.180 --> 01:22:11.180]   that you have rescued us from.
[01:22:11.180 --> 01:22:15.180]   That we would no longer, Lord, desire to look back,
[01:22:15.180 --> 01:22:19.180]   but to look forward to the eternal glory
[01:22:19.180 --> 01:22:21.180]   that is coming with Christ.
[01:22:21.180 --> 01:22:25.180]   I pray, Father God, that wherever it is that you send us,
[01:22:25.180 --> 01:22:27.180]   help us, Lord God, to live set apart.
[01:22:27.180 --> 01:22:30.180]   That we may be the aroma of Christ.
[01:22:30.180 --> 01:22:33.180]   That more and more people will know
[01:22:33.180 --> 01:22:36.180]   that there is hope in this dark world.
[01:22:36.180 --> 01:22:40.180]   That we would be the light,
[01:22:40.180 --> 01:22:42.180]   that we would not hide the light.
[01:22:42.180 --> 01:22:47.180]   That more and more and more souls
[01:22:47.180 --> 01:22:50.180]   will come to know you, Father God.
[01:22:50.180 --> 01:22:54.180]   Use us mightily for your kingdom.
[01:22:54.180 --> 01:22:57.180]   Help us, Lord God, to be heralder of the truth,
[01:22:57.180 --> 01:22:59.180]   of your word, and of the gospel.
[01:22:59.180 --> 01:23:04.180]   Save us, save our children, save our families,
[01:23:04.180 --> 01:23:07.180]   save our parents, save our neighbors,
