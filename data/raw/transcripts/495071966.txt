[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.320]   Okay, well good morning everyone.
[00:00:06.320 --> 00:00:08.840]   Now if you could turn with me to Matthew 24.
[00:00:08.840 --> 00:00:22.040]   I will be reading verses 8-13 here.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:24.520]   Starting from verse 8.
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:28.200]   The fool is said to the prudent, "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going
[00:00:28.200 --> 00:00:29.200]   out."
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:33.200]   But the prudent answered, "No, there will not be enough for us, and you too.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:36.240]   Go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves."
[00:00:36.240 --> 00:00:39.480]   And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.720]   were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:47.400]   Later the other virgins also came, saying, "Lord, Lord, open up for us."
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:51.720]   But he answered, "Truly I say to you, I do not know you.
[00:00:51.720 --> 00:00:55.000]   Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the hour."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:00:58.280]   Alright, I'll pray for us.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:04.920]   Heavenly Father, after a year like 2020, we've arrived here at our last Sunday, and we thank
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:05.920]   you.
[00:01:05.920 --> 00:01:09.200]   God, we can't help but give you worship and praise.
[00:01:09.200 --> 00:01:14.560]   Thank you that we can trust in a faithful God who never changes.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:19.400]   And Lord, I pray that as we look into your Word, we would remember who you are, we would
[00:01:19.400 --> 00:01:25.040]   remember the power of your Word, and Father, we would allow it.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.600]   God, pass all the rebellion and stubbornness of our hearts to soak and sanctify into our
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:31.600]   hearts.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:34.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:34.600 --> 00:01:42.000]   Alright, well, this is the last Sunday of 2020, and I was curious, I couldn't remember,
[00:01:42.000 --> 00:01:46.720]   but last year, the last Sunday of 2020, I actually preached as well, and I didn't realize
[00:01:46.720 --> 00:01:50.840]   it until I looked back to see what the topic was on last year.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:55.880]   And it was pretty fascinating because, you know, it's the last Sunday of 2020, so what
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:01:59.680]   you can do is look back at the year and think through, like, "Man, what was the year like?"
[00:01:59.680 --> 00:02:04.080]   In 2019, there wasn't much, but you kind of had to dig to look into some of the world
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.000]   events that happened.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.440]   This year, you know, it's pretty self-explanatory.
[00:02:09.440 --> 00:02:13.480]   There's a lot that happened, and I'm going to do the obligatory thing.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.120]   I'm going to kind of draw our attention again to some of the things, I'm not going to go
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.200]   very long, some of the things that happened this past year.
[00:02:20.200 --> 00:02:25.360]   It was a year filled with protests, political turmoil.
[00:02:25.360 --> 00:02:28.080]   We turned on the TV to see cities on fire.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:34.080]   We saw notable deaths of famous people, among which were a few Christian giants.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:40.120]   Wildfires, many of you were displaced from your homes because of these wildfires.
[00:02:40.120 --> 00:02:43.960]   There's explosions and killings.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:47.240]   And obviously, the thing that probably rises to the surface of all of this is the global
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:50.280]   pandemic, COVID-19.
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:51.880]   That's the craziest thing.
[00:02:51.880 --> 00:02:56.160]   2020 really, really has been a crazy year, right?
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:03:00.520]   It's been so crazy that it's become a meme.
[00:03:00.520 --> 00:03:04.320]   For those of you who don't know what a meme is, it's this thing where it's a picture and
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:08.360]   then, like, people, like, describe something with this picture.
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:12.720]   And 2020 has become a description of sorts.
[00:03:12.720 --> 00:03:17.200]   When people think about the year 2020, if you haven't noticed, people kind of get angry.
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:21.560]   Or if something bad happens, people yell out, "2020!"
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:22.560]   It's kind of funny, right?
[00:03:22.560 --> 00:03:25.760]   It doesn't really make sense, but people are like, "Oh, my gosh, only in 2020, this will
[00:03:25.760 --> 00:03:28.200]   happen."
[00:03:28.200 --> 00:03:32.080]   It's because this year has been so wild.
[00:03:32.080 --> 00:03:37.560]   Because of this, though, I think, knowingly or unknowingly, we're looking forward to the
[00:03:37.560 --> 00:03:38.720]   turn of the calendar year.
[00:03:38.720 --> 00:03:40.320]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.640]   As if, like, 2020 coming in is going to actually change something.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:46.680]   It's not, right?
[00:03:46.680 --> 00:03:48.280]   It's not going to change anything.
[00:03:48.280 --> 00:03:50.480]   It's an arbitrary date in the calendar.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:52.320]   It's just something that's there.
[00:03:52.320 --> 00:03:55.520]   And then once 2021 comes, it doesn't mean that anything's going to change.
[00:03:55.520 --> 00:03:58.200]   Everything will continue to tick on.
[00:03:58.200 --> 00:03:59.200]   But I understand.
[00:03:59.200 --> 00:04:01.600]   2020 was just so difficult.
[00:04:01.600 --> 00:04:08.120]   There are so many hard things going on that, from a worldly perspective, we want things
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:11.000]   to change.
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.160]   If you think back, especially at the month of March, when it felt like the whole world
[00:04:15.160 --> 00:04:23.240]   flipped upside down, when everything was beginning to shut down, we're all sheltering in place,
[00:04:23.240 --> 00:04:26.880]   a word that comes to mind, a favorite of Berean is this word "soberness."
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:29.280]   And what a sobering time it actually was.
[00:04:29.280 --> 00:04:33.040]   It was so sobering.
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:35.000]   It put life into perspective.
[00:04:35.960 --> 00:04:41.320]   Really just one swing of things and the entire world was brought to its knees.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:47.440]   And this virus, it's unseen by the naked eye, right?
[00:04:47.440 --> 00:04:49.760]   It's so small.
[00:04:49.760 --> 00:04:51.840]   And really, it just brought devastation.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.880]   It flipped everything upside down.
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:05:01.160]   For many of us, as we sat in our rooms trying to work from home, and we had our frontline
[00:05:01.160 --> 00:05:06.280]   workers, we had our healthcare workers, among whom we need many prayers for them now, but
[00:05:06.280 --> 00:05:12.520]   besides them, many of us found ourselves working from home.
[00:05:12.520 --> 00:05:20.520]   And I remember talking to people and thinking, "Wow, people sound very sober right now."
[00:05:20.520 --> 00:05:26.400]   And people would talk about their lives and how everything has slowed down and how everything
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:32.000]   was a little quieter and the time with the Lord for the first time in many, many months,
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:36.840]   maybe even years, it was so sweet.
[00:05:36.840 --> 00:05:41.240]   I mean, I don't know if you kind of relate with that, but that time, that March, April,
[00:05:41.240 --> 00:05:48.640]   May, there were a lot of people who had just sweet times in the Word, in prayer, in trust,
[00:05:48.640 --> 00:05:49.640]   in faith.
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:53.480]   I mean, life is so crazy, it's so hectic, that finally you get to this point where everything
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:58.240]   slows down and you can't meet with people.
[00:05:58.240 --> 00:05:59.240]   It felt kind of good.
[00:05:59.240 --> 00:06:04.080]   I had a friend, he had a phrase that he used to use a lot, it was like, "It hurts so good."
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:06.000]   I think that was very good, you know?
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.200]   It hurts so good.
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:13.960]   It felt good to feel that sobriety and that awareness and that perspective change and
[00:06:13.960 --> 00:06:17.320]   that sharp kind of jab of the reality of the world.
[00:06:17.320 --> 00:06:18.320]   It felt good, right?
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:23.080]   And so for Christians, it was actually a great time.
[00:06:23.080 --> 00:06:26.400]   It was really good.
[00:06:26.400 --> 00:06:31.400]   To feel the brittleness and the feebleness of our own existence was good.
[00:06:31.400 --> 00:06:36.000]   It felt good.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:41.640]   The reality of a sovereign God who reigns over the world was brought into spotlight.
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:48.240]   And so something that we can espouse so easily and so quickly about, like, oh, God is sovereign,
[00:06:48.240 --> 00:06:51.080]   God is good, God is in control, He is the King.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:54.200]   He is authoritative over all things.
[00:06:54.200 --> 00:06:59.400]   Nothing comes to pass but by His Word.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.600]   But we stare at something so life-changing and we realize how far we are from the things
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:08.600]   that we would espouse.
[00:07:08.600 --> 00:07:12.600]   And it was good.
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:16.040]   Before we lived under the illusion that we are actually somewhat in control of our own
[00:07:16.040 --> 00:07:23.160]   destinies and talk of a sovereign God became very lip service.
[00:07:23.160 --> 00:07:29.360]   And I think during that time, many of us began again to truly desire the coming Kingdom.
[00:07:29.360 --> 00:07:33.560]   Wow, this world is broken.
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:40.560]   I think many of our prayer lives were restored and rejuvenated.
[00:07:40.560 --> 00:07:48.920]   We were taking time to behold the Lord and it was really just a good time.
[00:07:48.920 --> 00:07:53.880]   And so as we think back at 2020 and as we think about everything that's been happening,
[00:07:53.880 --> 00:07:59.720]   my hope is that today as we go into a couple passages, or I mean a couple points, we're
[00:07:59.720 --> 00:08:04.120]   gonna be jumping around in a lot of passages, but that it would be an opportunity for us
[00:08:04.120 --> 00:08:09.880]   to think again about whether the soberness that came with the pandemic is still with
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:13.120]   us or now, where are our eyes?
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:17.080]   Or to think about now, where have our attentions again gone?
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:22.240]   Where before it brought soberness and clarity and a desire again for God to return, is that
[00:08:22.240 --> 00:08:23.240]   the case?
[00:08:23.240 --> 00:08:29.720]   Even just this morning, when you think about yourself right now, is that the case?
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:34.400]   So I'm gonna take us through two points and these two points are gonna be pretty simple
[00:08:34.400 --> 00:08:35.400]   ones.
[00:08:35.400 --> 00:08:39.440]   The first point is that the Old Testament people were waiting for the coming King.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:41.600]   The Old Testament people were waiting for the coming King.
[00:08:41.600 --> 00:08:46.360]   And then the second point is very similar to that, it's we similarly are waiting for
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:48.240]   the coming King.
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:53.440]   So as this pandemic, like that broke us out of the pedestrian type of thinking and living,
[00:08:53.440 --> 00:08:57.920]   now if you think about how we're living now, I think we've gone back into that.
[00:08:57.920 --> 00:08:59.680]   Like normalcy kind of occurs.
[00:08:59.680 --> 00:09:02.640]   And so there was a time when these things weren't a thing, right?
[00:09:02.640 --> 00:09:05.440]   You go into a supermarket and see everyone wearing a mask and you'd be like, "What is
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   this?
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:07.440]   What world have we come into?"
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:10.840]   And so now you go into a supermarket, it's just, "Oh, everyone's just doing it," right?
[00:09:10.840 --> 00:09:15.440]   Everything just kind of goes back to normal way of life.
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:18.080]   So our eyes just kind of go back to like, "Oh, this is life."
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.120]   And we try to make this world again something palatable to us.
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:28.440]   And so this first point, the things that we think about, the soberness that we're called
[00:09:28.440 --> 00:09:33.000]   to and the coming of a King and the coming of a kingdom is actually something that's
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:35.240]   been happening all through the Bible.
[00:09:35.240 --> 00:09:41.680]   And so if you look at Christmas, for example, I mean, that's the whole point of Christmas
[00:09:41.680 --> 00:09:47.680]   is that there was a people called the Israelites who were waiting for the Messiah King to come,
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:49.560]   the promised King.
[00:09:49.560 --> 00:09:53.200]   And this Messiah King was supposed to bring in a coming kingdom.
[00:09:53.200 --> 00:09:58.280]   I mean, Israelite history is so fascinating because there are all these prophecies of
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:09:59.280]   this Messiah to come.
[00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:02.920]   It's just chapter after verse after passage.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:07.360]   It's all over the place.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.600]   Starting with Adam and Eve, God promises that a singular seed, which is the Messiah, would
[00:10:10.600 --> 00:10:12.680]   come from Eve.
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.320]   With Abraham, He promised that a singular seed would come up out of his lineage, which
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:19.800]   is Jesus, the Messiah.
[00:10:19.800 --> 00:10:23.520]   And God actually promised Abraham that there would be a great people that come out of you,
[00:10:23.520 --> 00:10:29.000]   and there's going to be a great king, and he's going to usher in a great kingdom.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:35.240]   So when King David comes into the picture, it looks like maybe this is it.
[00:10:35.240 --> 00:10:40.000]   It looks like maybe God is, maybe this is actually the Messiah.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:47.200]   Not from the line of Judah, coming in to help us conquer the promised land.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:51.400]   But even during the heyday of Israel, the golden age of Israel, during the time of King
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:57.680]   David, King Solomon, and you know it can't be it because there's so much sin.
[00:10:57.680 --> 00:11:02.560]   There's so much brokenness during this time.
[00:11:02.560 --> 00:11:09.520]   And this current of constantly wanting to make this world it, wanting to look for a
[00:11:09.520 --> 00:11:15.640]   savior that's going to come and make this kingdom the one that we're living for, it's
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:18.880]   just been all over the place.
[00:11:18.880 --> 00:11:21.760]   But quickly we know that that can't be it during the time of David.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:25.080]   Because Assyria comes in and conquers the northern kingdom.
[00:11:25.080 --> 00:11:28.840]   Babylon comes in and conquers the southern kingdom.
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:32.440]   These kingdom after kingdom after kingdom comes in and takes over, and we're like, "Oh,
[00:11:32.440 --> 00:11:33.440]   that wasn't it.
[00:11:33.440 --> 00:11:35.080]   King David wasn't it.
[00:11:35.080 --> 00:11:36.840]   That wasn't the Messiah.
[00:11:36.840 --> 00:11:43.000]   That wasn't the Messiah who was supposed to come in and usher in the kingdom."
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.200]   And so Israelites again are brought to that place where it's just, "He's coming.
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:49.240]   The king is coming.
[00:11:49.240 --> 00:11:51.240]   He's going to usher in the kingdom.
[00:11:51.240 --> 00:11:52.240]   Wait for him.
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:11:54.160]   Look for him.
[00:11:54.160 --> 00:11:57.080]   Don't establish yourself where you are."
[00:11:57.080 --> 00:11:58.600]   Especially when they're in the exile, right?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.440]   Don't establish yourself where you are.
[00:12:01.440 --> 00:12:10.160]   Wait, look to his coming, to the salvation that he'll bring to the people.
[00:12:10.160 --> 00:12:11.840]   Don't get tempted by the world.
[00:12:11.840 --> 00:12:13.800]   Turn away from sin and idolatry.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:14.800]   Remain faithful to God.
[00:12:14.800 --> 00:12:16.320]   Put your trust in him.
[00:12:16.320 --> 00:12:20.880]   All of that stuff was for the Israelites.
[00:12:20.880 --> 00:12:30.000]   But this is very applicable to us because these promises of a coming king continued.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.280]   I mean, these promises of a king that's supposed to come, we find it in multiple passages.
[00:12:35.280 --> 00:12:39.440]   If you look at Isaiah 7.14, it says, "Therefore, the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:44.280]   Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son, and she will call his name Emmanuel.
[00:12:44.280 --> 00:12:48.200]   For a child will be born to us, a son will be given, and the government will rest on
[00:12:48.200 --> 00:12:52.920]   his shoulders, and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor, Mighty God, Eternal
[00:12:52.920 --> 00:12:57.240]   Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:12:57.240 --> 00:13:02.760]   Micah 5.2, "But as for you, Bethlehem Epiphtha, too little to be among the clans of Judah.
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:05.720]   From you, one will go forth from you to be ruler in Israel.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:09.120]   His goings forth are from long ago, from the days of eternity."
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:10.520]   And so it's promise after promise.
[00:13:10.520 --> 00:13:15.520]   These are just three prophecies, three passages, but it's given to Israel saying he's coming.
[00:13:15.520 --> 00:13:16.520]   The Messiah's coming.
[00:13:16.520 --> 00:13:17.520]   The king is going to come.
[00:13:17.520 --> 00:13:20.640]   He's going to bring in a kingdom.
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.640]   These Israelites are waiting, and they're waiting, and they're waiting.
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:28.080]   So during this time of Christmas, it's really awesome.
[00:13:28.080 --> 00:13:33.600]   It's a beautiful time to remember that he actually came, that the prophecies were actually
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:41.960]   fulfilled, that the Messiah actually came to do what he was purposed to do.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:44.400]   These Israelites weren't too different from us.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.200]   They too were waiting for a king.
[00:13:46.200 --> 00:13:51.480]   A promised Messiah would bring the salvation, who was supposed to take them home.
[00:13:51.480 --> 00:14:00.640]   I mean, when we see how the Israelites were living, it's very, very applicable to us.
[00:14:00.640 --> 00:14:03.480]   But I think that's what's terrifying.
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:12.320]   This is what's really scary about that, is that the Israelites were waiting for the king.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.720]   Are you catching where we're going with this?
[00:14:14.720 --> 00:14:18.080]   They were waiting.
[00:14:18.080 --> 00:14:24.840]   Their entire culture was about waiting for the Messiah to bring in the coming kingdom.
[00:14:24.840 --> 00:14:31.760]   I mean, they were serving, they were sacrificing, they were worshipers of ... They were the
[00:14:31.760 --> 00:14:34.400]   chosen people of God.
[00:14:34.400 --> 00:14:38.560]   They knew that.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:43.760]   These Israelites, many of them are crying out to God for him to come.
[00:14:43.760 --> 00:14:46.120]   This is scary, because why?
[00:14:46.120 --> 00:14:53.520]   When Jesus comes, they kill him.
[00:14:53.520 --> 00:14:55.040]   How does that happen?
[00:14:55.040 --> 00:14:56.520]   How do you make that jump?
[00:14:56.520 --> 00:15:01.340]   An entire civilization of people waiting for the coming Messiah, waiting for the kingdom
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:08.000]   of God to come, Yahweh worshipers, that when the Messiah that they're waiting for, prophecy
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:12.040]   after prophecy after prophecy, text after text after text, waiting, waiting, waiting,
[00:15:12.040 --> 00:15:15.680]   that when he comes, they kill him.
[00:15:15.680 --> 00:15:19.380]   That jump is just astronomical, right?
[00:15:19.380 --> 00:15:22.200]   How does that happen?
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.760]   In John chapter five, verse 39, it says, Jesus says, "You search the scriptures, because
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:27.460]   you think that in them you have eternal life.
[00:15:27.460 --> 00:15:33.000]   It is these that testify about me, and you are unwilling to come to me, so that you may
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.760]   have life."
[00:15:34.760 --> 00:15:37.600]   How is it that they can't recognize the one they're living for?
[00:15:37.600 --> 00:15:42.360]   Their entire lifestyle, everything about their life was supposed to be waiting for this king
[00:15:42.360 --> 00:15:44.960]   to come.
[00:15:44.960 --> 00:15:47.680]   What happened?
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:57.480]   Furthermore, when Jesus comes, after years and years and years of anticipation and expectation
[00:15:57.480 --> 00:16:07.560]   and suspense and a hope, when he finally comes, it's murder.
[00:16:07.560 --> 00:16:13.160]   Crucifixion.
[00:16:13.160 --> 00:16:16.320]   This happens because it reveals something about the human heart.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.240]   This isn't just the Israelites.
[00:16:18.240 --> 00:16:20.560]   This reveals something about the human heart.
[00:16:20.560 --> 00:16:26.960]   See, these Israelites are waiting and looking for a Messiah king of their own making.
[00:16:26.960 --> 00:16:32.600]   These Israelites, they were looking for a Messiah king who would deliver them to everything
[00:16:32.600 --> 00:16:34.200]   their hearts desired.
[00:16:34.200 --> 00:16:40.920]   When the Messiah king did not look like the king they wanted or the king they expected,
[00:16:40.920 --> 00:16:46.200]   they didn't just grumble and complain and unwillingly, grumblingly follow God or follow
[00:16:46.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   Jesus.
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:50.200]   They didn't just say, "Oh, man, this wasn't what I expected."
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:53.040]   They didn't just push Jesus aside and ignore him.
[00:16:53.040 --> 00:16:56.360]   What was the response?
[00:16:56.360 --> 00:16:59.960]   It was murder.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:02.280]   That's what the human heart does.
[00:17:02.280 --> 00:17:07.440]   That's what the sinful person does.
[00:17:07.440 --> 00:17:11.420]   When the promised Messiah king finally arrived into the world, their reaction completely
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:16.720]   exposed the desires of their hearts and how far they were from God.
[00:17:16.720 --> 00:17:19.520]   A simple definition of sin means to miss the mark.
[00:17:19.520 --> 00:17:24.240]   Now, the Israelites missed the mark.
[00:17:24.240 --> 00:17:30.760]   What they did to Jesus was this tangible, concrete example of what sin is and what sin
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.440]   does and what sin accomplishes.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:41.800]   Oh, you missed the mark.
[00:17:41.800 --> 00:17:44.640]   Look at this prophecy of Jesus in Isaiah 53.
[00:17:44.640 --> 00:17:48.600]   It says, "For he grew up before him like a tender shoot and like a root out of parched
[00:17:48.600 --> 00:17:49.600]   ground.
[00:17:49.600 --> 00:17:53.760]   He had no stately form or majesty that we should look upon him, nor appearance that
[00:17:53.760 --> 00:17:55.480]   we should be attracted to him.
[00:17:55.480 --> 00:18:00.360]   He was despised and forsaken of men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief, and
[00:18:00.360 --> 00:18:07.920]   like one from whom men hide their face, he was despised and we did not esteem him."
[00:18:07.920 --> 00:18:15.560]   This picture of Jesus being unattractive is not just being like, "Oh."
[00:18:15.560 --> 00:18:17.400]   First of all, it's not just talking about his physical appearance.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:18.720]   That's not what this is talking about.
[00:18:18.720 --> 00:18:21.920]   It's that people are just unattracted to the man.
[00:18:21.920 --> 00:18:23.960]   But when you think about that, you're like, "Okay."
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:31.560]   But when you think about that, what about Jesus was particularly unattractive?
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:36.640]   He isn't unattractive, right?
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.520]   He healed people.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:41.360]   He miraculously fed people.
[00:18:41.360 --> 00:18:44.800]   He loved people so much and he preached others to love people.
[00:18:44.800 --> 00:18:46.960]   He was gentle and kind to the poor.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.640]   He helped the disenfranchised.
[00:18:48.640 --> 00:18:49.840]   He was a great teacher.
[00:18:49.840 --> 00:18:50.840]   He taught to love.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:55.200]   When people think of Gandhi, I don't think of anyone hating the guy.
[00:18:55.200 --> 00:18:59.160]   I don't think of anyone saying, "What an unattractive dude.
[00:18:59.160 --> 00:19:00.440]   I don't like his message."
[00:19:00.440 --> 00:19:04.680]   No, actually, when we go evangelizing around the campus at UCI and different places, you
[00:19:04.680 --> 00:19:06.680]   talk to people and people say, "Who's Jesus?"
[00:19:06.680 --> 00:19:07.680]   He was a good teacher.
[00:19:07.680 --> 00:19:13.880]   He was a pretty like, I mean, I know he's a loving guy, good morals.
[00:19:13.880 --> 00:19:19.480]   But this passage in Isaiah 53 is talking about like, "Man, he's unattractive."
[00:19:19.480 --> 00:19:23.640]   There's actually something repelling about the man.
[00:19:23.640 --> 00:19:26.400]   So what is it?
[00:19:26.400 --> 00:19:31.160]   What causes a person to look upon Jesus and be repelled?
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:39.460]   Well, if it's a Jesus of your own making, it's not repelling.
[00:19:39.460 --> 00:19:47.480]   But if it's Jesus as who he is, it's incredibly threatening to the sinful heart.
[00:19:47.480 --> 00:19:56.520]   There is something inherent about Jesus that sinful man hates through and through.
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:57.520]   You know why?
[00:19:57.520 --> 00:20:01.040]   When Jesus comes, he's the king.
[00:20:01.040 --> 00:20:04.640]   You know how threatening that is?
[00:20:04.640 --> 00:20:06.840]   He's the Lord.
[00:20:06.840 --> 00:20:09.200]   He's God.
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:12.080]   Everything centers around him.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.960]   You know how threatening that is to the sinner?
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:20.720]   When he stepped into the world, it demanded recognition that everything is about God and
[00:20:20.720 --> 00:20:25.000]   life can only be found in God, that everything is about God's glory.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:31.280]   You see, sinners cannot accept Jesus Christ who is here to make our lives better, right?
[00:20:31.280 --> 00:20:35.040]   Sinners cannot accept the Jesus Christ who says that life is not about me, but that it's
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:36.800]   about him.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.640]   Sinners can't accept someone who says that life is about his glory and not my glory.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:49.480]   I mean, we can sit here and use Christian terms all we want, but man, the glory that
[00:20:49.480 --> 00:21:01.040]   we desire in sinfulness, sinners will murder the one that threatens that, even ultimately
[00:21:01.040 --> 00:21:02.660]   God himself.
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:06.080]   Sinful man will be repelled by Jesus.
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:10.600]   Sinful man will hate him, see him as an enemy, a threat, and a danger to the very way they
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:12.440]   want to live.
[00:21:12.440 --> 00:21:15.600]   We all have definite shapes of what we want our life to look like.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:16.960]   We all have ambitions.
[00:21:16.960 --> 00:21:18.800]   We all have goals.
[00:21:18.800 --> 00:21:21.880]   When we come in here and we say, "Man, where are my eyes fixed?
[00:21:21.880 --> 00:21:26.400]   I want them to be fixed up in heaven where Jesus is and not on the things of this world.
[00:21:26.400 --> 00:21:28.960]   I want to seek the things above and not the things of this world.
[00:21:28.960 --> 00:21:31.880]   I want to seek the heavenly things and the kingdom things and not the things of this
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:34.480]   kingdom and the things of this world because we know they're passing away."
[00:21:34.480 --> 00:21:35.480]   Nice.
[00:21:35.480 --> 00:21:46.520]   But when we really look at where our eyes are, when we really look at where our ambitions
[00:21:46.520 --> 00:21:54.840]   are and our desires, where they lay, I mean, it doesn't have to be I want a mansion and
[00:21:54.840 --> 00:21:57.160]   a Lamborghini.
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:22:03.480]   It looks probably more like I want my student loans paid off and a girlfriend, but it's
[00:22:03.480 --> 00:22:10.400]   still just everything revolving around me.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:14.800]   While desires themselves are not always wrong, while they are not always the culprit, many
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.520]   times if you take a good stare at your desires, if you evaluate what's going on in your heart,
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:26.720]   you can see how quick we are to ascend to that throne and to kick God off that throne.
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.000]   See, that kind of sinful living is not me just grumbling and complaining and just going
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.080]   along with God.
[00:22:34.080 --> 00:22:37.960]   That's not just pushing Him aside or ignoring Him.
[00:22:37.960 --> 00:22:42.840]   That kind of sinful heart is closer and more representative of what sinners were doing
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:49.840]   to Jesus on the cross.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:57.040]   We don't like to think that pushing God off the throne of my little heart is that bad.
[00:22:57.040 --> 00:23:04.200]   I'm here to humbly say that what humanity does in sin is more than pushing God off the
[00:23:04.200 --> 00:23:05.200]   throne.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:10.880]   The desire is actually for murder.
[00:23:10.880 --> 00:23:13.880]   It's for God's nonexistence.
[00:23:13.880 --> 00:23:22.160]   If I call attention back to Isaiah 53, I mean, just one simple thing of hermeneutics, just
[00:23:22.160 --> 00:23:24.160]   look at the pronouns.
[00:23:24.160 --> 00:23:28.040]   And that word "we" is actually very heavy.
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:32.480]   It says in Isaiah 53, "We did not esteem Him."
[00:23:32.480 --> 00:23:33.840]   Not they, but we.
[00:23:33.840 --> 00:23:35.600]   This is Isaiah talking here.
[00:23:35.600 --> 00:23:41.540]   It's "We did not esteem Him."
[00:23:41.540 --> 00:23:45.320]   When we read this understanding that this is talking about the cross, and that's what
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.680]   happens right after this passage, right?
[00:23:47.680 --> 00:23:50.160]   The Messiah on the cross.
[00:23:50.160 --> 00:23:57.520]   He's just talking about the crucifixion through which Jesus would go on our behalf.
[00:23:57.520 --> 00:24:03.360]   So when we read this passage rightfully, we look at it and it's very intimate to us.
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:07.720]   Yes it's for the Israelite first, but then it is also for us.
[00:24:07.720 --> 00:24:13.520]   We did not esteem Him.
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:14.520]   We sing about it.
[00:24:14.520 --> 00:24:15.520]   We sing about it this morning.
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:18.760]   "Behold the man upon the cross, my sin upon his shoulders.
[00:24:18.760 --> 00:24:21.960]   Ashamed I heard my mocking voice call out among the scoffers.
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:26.280]   It was my sin that held him there until it was accomplished."
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:28.720]   See this is the desire of every sinful heart.
[00:24:28.720 --> 00:24:36.800]   Not just to turn and to grumble and push God aside, but it's to nail Him to a cross.
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:37.800]   Every sinful heart.
[00:24:37.800 --> 00:24:41.720]   That's what that is.
[00:24:41.720 --> 00:24:44.320]   That's why the Israelites, they were living for the Messiah.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:46.000]   They were waiting for the Messiah.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:51.240]   Crying out for the Messiah and when He came, He did not look like what they wanted.
[00:24:51.240 --> 00:24:54.320]   He came in declaring, "I am God."
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:59.320]   That was incredibly threatening to them.
[00:24:59.320 --> 00:25:04.640]   The Messiah did not fulfill their deepest desire to make life better for them, for them
[00:25:04.640 --> 00:25:08.400]   to ascend to the supremacy of the throne.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:11.040]   And so they killed Him.
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:14.600]   And so this brings us into the pivot of our second point.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.440]   Similarly, we are waiting for the coming King.
[00:25:16.440 --> 00:25:20.760]   Now we've been talking about Israel, but obviously this is so close to us.
[00:25:20.760 --> 00:25:24.160]   Just like the Israelites were waiting for the Messiah to come, we're similarly doing
[00:25:24.160 --> 00:25:25.480]   the same thing.
[00:25:25.480 --> 00:25:27.440]   And this is where our passage today comes in.
[00:25:27.440 --> 00:25:29.160]   We're going to start from verse 1 here, Matthew 25.
[00:25:29.160 --> 00:25:33.240]   So if you could turn there, Matthew chapter 25 verse 1.
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:36.760]   It says there, "The kingdom of heaven will be comparable to ten virgins who took their
[00:25:36.760 --> 00:25:38.940]   lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
[00:25:38.940 --> 00:25:41.360]   Five of them were foolish and five were prudent.
[00:25:41.360 --> 00:25:46.760]   For when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the prudent took
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:49.160]   oil in flasks along with their lamps."
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.100]   So in this story, there are ten virgins, and you could think about them as bridesmaids.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:56.720]   That's probably the best parallel we have with that.
[00:25:56.720 --> 00:26:02.540]   It was customary to have a pretty extended patrol period before the actual wedding was
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:03.940]   supposed to happen.
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:08.000]   And so later on, the groom would come, and people would be waiting for the groom to come
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:12.560]   to receive him so that the groom could go to the bride and take her.
[00:26:12.560 --> 00:26:14.360]   That was the custom of the day.
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:18.400]   These bridesmaids would line up in anticipation of this groom to come, but they would not
[00:26:18.400 --> 00:26:20.960]   know when he was supposed to come.
[00:26:20.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   They just knew he was supposed to come soon, and that's it.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:27.220]   It could take a long time.
[00:26:27.220 --> 00:26:28.720]   The road could be pretty perilous.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:33.720]   There could be, you know, natural disasters that occurred or storms that happened so that
[00:26:33.720 --> 00:26:40.080]   it would impede their path and things like that, and so they didn't know.
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.560]   So this is the setting in verse 5.
[00:26:42.560 --> 00:26:47.600]   It says, "Now while the bridegroom was delaying, they all got drowsy and began to sleep.
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:50.820]   But at midnight there was a shout, 'Behold, the bridegroom!
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.320]   Come out to meet him!'
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.600]   Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps."
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:01.480]   So what happens here is all ten fall asleep, and there's no judgment pronounced on the
[00:27:01.480 --> 00:27:02.480]   women for falling asleep.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:03.480]   That's important.
[00:27:03.480 --> 00:27:05.840]   We're in First Thessalonians as a church right now, right?
[00:27:05.840 --> 00:27:07.160]   We're not supposed to fall asleep.
[00:27:07.160 --> 00:27:08.360]   That's not the point of this passage.
[00:27:08.360 --> 00:27:11.440]   They all fell asleep.
[00:27:11.440 --> 00:27:15.920]   They don't harp on the ten saying they should have been awake the entire time.
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:20.440]   The reality is, even though we know Jesus is supposed to come soon, it doesn't mean
[00:27:20.440 --> 00:27:24.840]   that we're supposed to sell everything and then quit our jobs and then we all sit out
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:26.840]   there in the courtyard and wait for Jesus to come.
[00:27:26.840 --> 00:27:28.260]   We're not going to do that, right?
[00:27:28.260 --> 00:27:30.160]   Because we don't know when he's going to come.
[00:27:30.160 --> 00:27:32.040]   We're called to continue to live our lives.
[00:27:32.040 --> 00:27:36.800]   And so it was similar to them.
[00:27:36.800 --> 00:27:41.840]   The point was that they were supposed to be prepared for the coming.
[00:27:41.840 --> 00:27:45.640]   And so when the bridegroom comes in the middle of the night, all of them wake up, all ten
[00:27:45.640 --> 00:27:49.160]   of them, and they all go out to meet him.
[00:27:49.160 --> 00:27:53.720]   And then as they're going, they're all trimming their lamps.
[00:27:53.720 --> 00:27:57.220]   We know from verse two, even though it's all, all, all.
[00:27:57.220 --> 00:28:00.480]   These words, if you look at the text, it's all, all of them are doing this, all of them
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:01.480]   are doing that.
[00:28:01.480 --> 00:28:04.320]   But verse two, it showed us that there are two groups of people, right?
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:11.720]   Five were foolish, five were prudent.
[00:28:11.720 --> 00:28:15.000]   When I would think of this parable, I would think, like, my mind would try to fill in
[00:28:15.000 --> 00:28:17.600]   the blank because we try to identify.
[00:28:17.600 --> 00:28:19.040]   That's what it automatically does.
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:23.640]   We try to identify what made the prudent the prudent, what made the foolish the foolish.
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.120]   And there were a couple ways I went.
[00:28:26.120 --> 00:28:28.320]   First, I thought maybe it's because they all fell asleep.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:33.280]   Well, but that can't be it because they all fell asleep, and even the five wise fell asleep.
[00:28:33.280 --> 00:28:36.100]   And so it can't be them, it can't be that.
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:39.560]   And secondly, I thought maybe it's because they let the lamp go out or close to going
[00:28:39.560 --> 00:28:40.560]   out.
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.880]   But it can't be that either because they all got up and they all realized their lamps were
[00:28:42.880 --> 00:28:48.920]   running low, and they all trimmed their lamps.
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:56.600]   In verse three is where it helps us to identify why five were wise and why five were foolish.
[00:28:56.600 --> 00:28:59.440]   The conjunction four is very helpful there if you look at verse three.
[00:28:59.440 --> 00:29:04.280]   It says, "Four, when the foolish took their lamps, they took no oil with them, but the
[00:29:04.280 --> 00:29:08.360]   prudent took oil and flasks along with their lamps."
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:12.440]   That four gives us the evidence judging why some were called foolish and why some were
[00:29:12.440 --> 00:29:15.740]   called wise.
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:17.600]   They weren't foolish because they fell asleep.
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.400]   They weren't foolish because they let the lamp go out.
[00:29:20.400 --> 00:29:25.040]   They were called foolish because they did not prepare extra oil.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.640]   That's why.
[00:29:27.640 --> 00:29:29.800]   The wise ones had prepared extra oil.
[00:29:29.800 --> 00:29:32.040]   The foolish ones did not prepare extra oil.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.840]   That's it.
[00:29:33.840 --> 00:29:37.280]   Those preparation.
[00:29:37.280 --> 00:29:42.320]   That's what differentiates the wise and the foolish, preparation.
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:44.080]   And what is the significance of this?
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:49.360]   Well, it's that the prudent were prepared to meet the bridegroom.
[00:29:49.360 --> 00:29:52.880]   The foolish were not prepared to meet the bridegroom.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:58.120]   And what this does is it brings exposure to the heart.
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.320]   That's what this does.
[00:30:00.320 --> 00:30:02.840]   Preparation brings exposure to the heart.
[00:30:02.840 --> 00:30:08.880]   Remember, they look exactly the same.
[00:30:08.880 --> 00:30:10.120]   They dressed in proper clothing.
[00:30:10.120 --> 00:30:12.680]   They're anticipating the same bridegroom.
[00:30:12.680 --> 00:30:14.000]   They're holding their lamps.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.200]   They're ready to receive him and light the way.
[00:30:16.200 --> 00:30:18.160]   They all fall asleep because it takes a while.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:22.520]   And when he comes, they all get up, trim their lamps, and rush over.
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:28.480]   But it says that five were not ready.
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:30.360]   What does that say about their heart?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:32.240]   I think this is the point right here, okay?
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.400]   What does this say about their heart?
[00:30:34.400 --> 00:30:39.120]   They didn't care.
[00:30:39.120 --> 00:30:44.560]   I think that's the whole point.
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:51.240]   Not being prepared showed that they did not care about the coming of the bridegroom.
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:59.160]   The problem wasn't their action at his arrival, or rather their inaction.
[00:30:59.160 --> 00:31:06.320]   It was that long before his arrival, he didn't prepare.
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:12.400]   See, unpreparedness is the mark of a person who doesn't care.
[00:31:12.400 --> 00:31:15.800]   They had no desire for the bridegroom's arrival.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   You know how you know?
[00:31:17.480 --> 00:31:21.200]   Just look at your life.
[00:31:21.200 --> 00:31:24.760]   When you care about something, think about how much you prepare.
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:31.000]   And when you don't care about something, think about how you prepare.
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.240]   I took out most of my examples for today because the sermon was going to go too long.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:37.280]   I'm going to keep this one.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:41.600]   I still play fantasy basketball with my old students from my old church.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.320]   And they prepare.
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.400]   Man, they have like draft boards.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:51.000]   One of my old students had like six different boards.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:54.680]   I'm sorry if you don't know basketball, but if one person gets taken at the top of the
[00:31:54.680 --> 00:31:58.600]   draft board, then what happens is they move on to their next draft board.
[00:31:58.600 --> 00:32:00.600]   It changes their entire plan.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:03.440]   And if another guy gets taken, then they'll move to the next draft board.
[00:32:03.440 --> 00:32:05.960]   And in their minds, they're thinking, if this person gets taken, then I'm going to choose
[00:32:05.960 --> 00:32:07.600]   this person, and things like that.
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:13.000]   And I love it because I don't prepare at all, and I still beat them every year.
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:19.120]   So it shows how much they care.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:22.040]   If you don't care, you just kind of stroll in and just do your thing, right?
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:27.560]   But some of you guys, I heard that fantasy basketball became an idol to some people at
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:28.560]   our church.
[00:32:28.560 --> 00:32:31.680]   Joking, kind of not joking, right?
[00:32:31.680 --> 00:32:34.840]   But when you look at it, you're like, man, that preparation you put into that.
[00:32:34.840 --> 00:32:35.840]   Why?
[00:32:35.840 --> 00:32:37.520]   Because you care.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:43.440]   If you didn't care, there's no preparation that would happen.
[00:32:43.440 --> 00:32:48.840]   Have you ever seen someone get ready when they're going to be in contact with somebody
[00:32:48.840 --> 00:32:52.920]   they like?
[00:32:52.920 --> 00:32:56.320]   Sometimes I think about, oh, maybe this isn't good to say.
[00:32:56.320 --> 00:32:57.320]   Oh, it's okay.
[00:32:57.320 --> 00:32:58.320]   Bam for six.
[00:32:58.320 --> 00:32:59.320]   There's bam for six.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:01.080]   And I just think, it'd be funny, right?
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:05.360]   Your roommate, you know your roommate is going out to bam for six, and this roommate of yours
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:08.080]   likes this one other person.
[00:33:08.080 --> 00:33:10.520]   Maybe this is not good to do.
[00:33:10.520 --> 00:33:16.960]   Anyway, but when you see this person taking care of themselves and putting every hair
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:18.240]   in place, you're like, what's the matter with you?
[00:33:18.240 --> 00:33:19.240]   What are you doing?
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:20.240]   You never do that.
[00:33:20.240 --> 00:33:21.240]   It's because they're preparing.
[00:33:21.240 --> 00:33:22.240]   Why?
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:23.240]   Because they care.
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:31.200]   Have you seen someone really desire a job and get ready for a job interview?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:32.200]   Have you ever seen someone?
[00:33:32.200 --> 00:33:39.160]   Man, they're like in front of the mirror, and they're getting themselves all ready.
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:46.560]   They have like paper after paper after paper all written down in these collated notes.
[00:33:46.560 --> 00:33:48.160]   If they say this, I'm going to do this.
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:50.520]   Oh, I know they're going to come up with this question.
[00:33:50.520 --> 00:33:53.840]   And then here's 10 possible questions they might come up with, even though none of them
[00:33:53.840 --> 00:33:55.040]   might come out in the interview.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:34:00.200]   They're so prepared versus the person who just kind of saunters into the job interview.
[00:34:00.200 --> 00:34:01.200]   And you know, they just sit down.
[00:34:01.200 --> 00:34:02.200]   You know they're not prepared.
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:03.200]   Why?
[00:34:03.200 --> 00:34:06.320]   Hey, do you even care about this job?
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:12.240]   I mean, that correlation between preparedness and caring is very intimate.
[00:34:12.240 --> 00:34:15.240]   It's very close.
[00:34:15.240 --> 00:34:18.280]   When you care about something, you always prepare.
[00:34:18.280 --> 00:34:28.120]   And when someone doesn't prepare, it brings exposure to their heart that they don't care.
[00:34:28.120 --> 00:34:32.740]   So these five foolish women, they're exposed.
[00:34:32.740 --> 00:34:40.760]   When Jesus arrives, they're exposed.
[00:34:40.760 --> 00:34:43.360]   They weren't prepared.
[00:34:43.360 --> 00:34:46.880]   Would it have been that difficult to procure the oil earlier on in the day?
[00:34:46.880 --> 00:34:51.600]   Would it have been that difficult for them to go into town and purchase it and have it
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:52.600]   ready?
[00:34:52.600 --> 00:34:57.360]   The answer is no.
[00:34:57.360 --> 00:35:01.240]   And so these five foolish ones, exposed at the moment when it says, "The bridegroom
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:05.680]   has arrived," they turn quickly to the five wise.
[00:35:05.680 --> 00:35:06.680]   Look at verse 8.
[00:35:06.680 --> 00:35:09.720]   "The foolish said to the prudent, 'Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:11.080]   out.'
[00:35:11.080 --> 00:35:14.280]   But the prudent answered, 'No, there will not be enough for us and you two.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:17.000]   Go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.'
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.480]   And while they were going away to make the purchase, the bridegroom came, and those who
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:27.760]   were ready went in with him to the wedding feast, and the door was shut.
[00:35:27.760 --> 00:35:31.160]   Later the other virgins also came, saying, 'Lord, Lord, open up for us.'
[00:35:31.160 --> 00:35:33.680]   But he answered, 'Truly I say to you, I do not know you.'"
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:40.800]   And here's the exhortation, "Be on the alert then, for you do not know the day nor the
[00:35:40.800 --> 00:35:41.800]   hour."
[00:35:41.800 --> 00:35:47.280]   You see, the five foolish can't take the oil from the five wise.
[00:35:47.280 --> 00:35:54.160]   So five wise are like, "Hey, you got to get your own," and rightfully so, right?
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:55.600]   They need enough to receive the groom.
[00:35:55.600 --> 00:35:57.280]   They need all of it.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:01.000]   It's for him.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.680]   And so we understand it is on each individual's plate.
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:13.760]   It is each personal person's responsibility to account for their own hearts.
[00:36:13.760 --> 00:36:18.800]   And these five, the moment they realized they needed oil, it was already too late for them.
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:21.200]   It was done.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:28.880]   It already exposed something of the past, and the door closed.
[00:36:28.880 --> 00:36:31.600]   If you're familiar with the book of Matthew, it's all about the kingdom.
[00:36:31.600 --> 00:36:33.120]   It's all about the coming king.
[00:36:33.120 --> 00:36:38.920]   It talks about this is what the kingdom looks like, and so everything else is not that.
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:41.040]   And so this is what kingdom people look like.
[00:36:41.040 --> 00:36:44.080]   Matthew 5, the Sermon on the Mount, when it starts with Beatitudes, is telling you what
[00:36:44.080 --> 00:36:49.000]   the kingdom people look like.
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   This is what the kingdom of God looks like.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:55.680]   You will be either prepared or you will be unprepared.
[00:36:55.680 --> 00:36:59.000]   That's it.
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.060]   That's how you can identify.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:05.120]   That's how you can see where you are.
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:09.000]   And I'll show your heart.
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:13.200]   So when we look back at the OT Israelites, and we think, "Man, they completely missed
[00:37:13.200 --> 00:37:15.280]   it.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:20.240]   When he came, they killed him."
[00:37:20.240 --> 00:37:24.360]   There is a danger of us being in a similar place, where we look like the wise, but we
[00:37:24.360 --> 00:37:27.600]   ourselves are actually foolish.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.760]   You might say that you're waiting for the coming Messiah king.
[00:37:30.760 --> 00:37:36.940]   You might say that you're prepared to go, that this world is passing away.
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:41.920]   You can say so many things that look so similar to what Christians ought to say.
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:44.540]   All of us would say we're waiting for the coming king.
[00:37:44.540 --> 00:37:51.780]   But when he comes, we will be exposed.
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.660]   There will be no hiding on that day.
[00:37:54.660 --> 00:38:01.220]   And those who aren't ready will be exposed.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:05.260]   That they actually have no desire for the king, and they never had any desire for the
[00:38:05.260 --> 00:38:07.300]   king.
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.780]   They're unprepared.
[00:38:09.780 --> 00:38:15.620]   So when Jesus comes again, many will be in panic mode.
[00:38:15.620 --> 00:38:23.020]   Many will try to do the action of what they were supposed to do, but it will be too late.
[00:38:23.020 --> 00:38:27.460]   Because it's not that moment that matters.
[00:38:27.460 --> 00:38:33.700]   It's the heart that's presented in that moment.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:37.660]   If there's an uncaring heart that has no love for the coming king, way prior to his
[00:38:37.660 --> 00:38:40.380]   arrival, it was just a matter of time.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.700]   Jesus could have come a month earlier, it would have been the same.
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.260]   Jesus could have come a month later, it would have been the same.
[00:38:45.260 --> 00:38:48.540]   It's not for, if I had just a little bit more time.
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:51.780]   We see that with the story of this Lazarus, right?
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:55.620]   This guy, if I just had more time, man, maybe I would have, but it's too late.
[00:38:55.620 --> 00:39:00.220]   He finds himself in a place where it's too late.
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:05.260]   The time when he comes will only be an exposure to what already exists in our hearts.
[00:39:05.260 --> 00:39:09.060]   Unprepared people have no love for God.
[00:39:09.060 --> 00:39:15.300]   And so when he comes, they will panic, they will run around, they'll look for excuses.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:23.940]   In actuality, he is unattractive to them.
[00:39:23.940 --> 00:39:25.720]   They want him off the throne.
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:27.380]   They want to be on that throne.
[00:39:27.380 --> 00:39:28.380]   And judgment awaits.
[00:39:28.380 --> 00:39:33.420]   I'm going to take a look at 2 Peter 3 here, verse 8.
[00:39:33.420 --> 00:39:37.380]   It says, "But do not let this one fact escape your notice, beloved, that with the Lord one
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.860]   day is like a thousand years, and a thousand years like one day.
[00:39:40.860 --> 00:39:44.860]   The Lord is not slow about his promises, some count slowness, but is patient toward you,
[00:39:44.860 --> 00:39:47.580]   not wishing for any to perish, but for all to come to repentance."
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:55.500]   See, this time period that we're living in right now is a time of grace.
[00:39:55.500 --> 00:40:00.140]   It was never meant to be eternal.
[00:40:00.140 --> 00:40:05.220]   And we sing these songs like, man, God's loving kindness, it never fails, his enduring love,
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.980]   all this kind of stuff.
[00:40:06.980 --> 00:40:09.180]   And for the believer, it's true.
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.340]   But for this world, it is not true.
[00:40:12.340 --> 00:40:15.960]   This world, we're existing in a ticking time bomb.
[00:40:15.960 --> 00:40:22.160]   If you've ever seen an hourglass with sand, it's already numbered how many, it's going.
[00:40:22.160 --> 00:40:25.540]   And when that thing is done, it's up.
[00:40:25.540 --> 00:40:28.460]   That's it.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:33.420]   And so it says here that this time is actually meant to bring people to repentance.
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:40.220]   I mean, it has a sense of this urgency that like when we're talking to people about this,
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:44.420]   it's not like, wow, God is good and gracious and loving and merciful and like that's it.
[00:40:44.420 --> 00:40:55.600]   It's like all this stuff, yes, but hurry.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:58.680]   That's why in the verse right after this in verse 10, it says, "But the day of the Lord
[00:40:58.680 --> 00:40:59.680]   will come like a thief."
[00:40:59.680 --> 00:41:03.480]   Yeah, it's slow right now.
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:08.640]   God's patience is long-lasting right now, but then when he comes, thief.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:09.640]   It'll be right away.
[00:41:09.640 --> 00:41:14.300]   It'll be sudden in which the heavens will pass away like a roar and the elements will
[00:41:14.300 --> 00:41:17.900]   be destroyed with intense heat and the earth and its work will be burned up.
[00:41:17.900 --> 00:41:22.740]   That means everything that we see, gone.
[00:41:22.740 --> 00:41:25.740]   Everything that we're working for, just gone.
[00:41:25.740 --> 00:41:31.500]   It'll be sudden.
[00:41:31.500 --> 00:41:36.420]   This is what God has always, when we say God or Christ, he is the same yesterday, today,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:37.420]   and forever.
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:38.420]   He never changes.
[00:41:38.420 --> 00:41:44.220]   We say, "How can God's kindness and grace and mercy upon this humanity ever change?"
[00:41:44.220 --> 00:41:45.220]   It's not that it ever changed.
[00:41:45.220 --> 00:41:46.420]   He never changed.
[00:41:46.420 --> 00:41:49.300]   He's always said, "I am going to return."
[00:41:49.300 --> 00:41:51.740]   He's always said, "Judgment will come."
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:57.420]   Judgment was always the end.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:06.260]   Today, we can be so certain that tomorrow will come, but we can't be mistaken.
[00:42:06.260 --> 00:42:08.900]   No one knows the time or the hour.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:13.740]   2 Peter 3 continues in verse 11, "Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way,
[00:42:13.740 --> 00:42:18.300]   what sort of people ought you to be in holy conduct and godliness, looking for and hastening
[00:42:18.300 --> 00:42:22.020]   the coming of the day of God, because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning and
[00:42:22.020 --> 00:42:26.580]   the elements will melt with intense heat, but according to his promise, we are looking
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:32.500]   for new heavens and a new earth in which righteousness dwells."
[00:42:32.500 --> 00:42:34.420]   I love this.
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.220]   You know what word I love a lot in this passage?
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.700]   In verse 12, "looking for and hastening."
[00:42:38.700 --> 00:42:42.420]   I love the word "hastening" because it has more—I feel like it has more oomph than
[00:42:42.420 --> 00:42:44.860]   like just looking for something.
[00:42:44.860 --> 00:42:50.940]   It's kind of the way my kids, like my 5-year-old and my 3-year-old are more aware of Christmas
[00:42:50.940 --> 00:42:52.420]   and all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:59.220]   So for the first time, my firstborn was trying to like hype up and get like my secondborn
[00:42:59.220 --> 00:43:00.420]   all excited about Christmas.
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:01.420]   And she would do that.
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:03.260]   She'd be like, "Four more days!
[00:43:03.260 --> 00:43:04.260]   Three more days!"
[00:43:04.260 --> 00:43:07.500]   We went to Home Depot like a long time ago, and then we made that thing where those blocks
[00:43:07.500 --> 00:43:10.180]   they change and you count down the days until Christmas.
[00:43:10.180 --> 00:43:12.820]   And they were doing that every single day, like, "Three more days!"
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.660]   And then two days before Christmas, she got up and she's like, "Daddy!"
[00:43:15.660 --> 00:43:16.660]   And she was laughing by herself.
[00:43:16.660 --> 00:43:18.460]   I'm like, "What is the matter with you?"
[00:43:18.460 --> 00:43:21.700]   And then like she was—she was saying, "I'm so excited because tomorrow I'm going to wake
[00:43:21.700 --> 00:43:23.540]   up and say tomorrow is Christmas."
[00:43:23.540 --> 00:43:24.820]   I'm like, "What?
[00:43:24.820 --> 00:43:25.820]   That's so weird."
[00:43:25.820 --> 00:43:29.300]   I'm like, "Wow, that anticipation though.
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.900]   I mean that's like hastening.
[00:43:31.900 --> 00:43:32.900]   I can't wait!"
[00:43:32.900 --> 00:43:35.460]   You know, it's like someone that's like, "Dude, chill out.
[00:43:35.460 --> 00:43:37.740]   I wanted to say that so many times.
[00:43:37.740 --> 00:43:39.300]   Like, calm down!"
[00:43:39.300 --> 00:43:43.020]   Those of you guys who have young children or have had young children, you remember,
[00:43:43.020 --> 00:43:45.860]   like, "Dude, calm down."
[00:43:45.860 --> 00:43:48.740]   For no reason, they're so excited, they just start running around the house.
[00:43:48.740 --> 00:43:50.820]   Like, man, why do kids run?
[00:43:50.820 --> 00:43:51.820]   It's so weird.
[00:43:51.820 --> 00:43:52.820]   You don't see adults doing that.
[00:43:52.820 --> 00:43:53.820]   They're just running around the house.
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:57.540]   They're just, "I can't wait!
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:43:58.540]   I can't wait!"
[00:43:58.540 --> 00:44:02.460]   And this passage is talking about this desire.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:05.420]   It's not just like, "Oh my gosh, the end is going to come.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:06.420]   I'm scared."
[00:44:06.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   You know?
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:13.140]   It's like, "I can't wait for it to come!"
[00:44:13.140 --> 00:44:15.540]   And there's this note of finality in this.
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:16.540]   When it comes, it's done.
[00:44:16.540 --> 00:44:21.340]   Pastor Peter, as he's been preaching through Hebrews 9, in verse 27, he read this, "In
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:24.980]   as much as it's appointed for men to die once and after this comes judgment, so Christ
[00:44:24.980 --> 00:44:28.900]   also having been offered once to bear the sins of many, will appear a second time for
[00:44:28.900 --> 00:44:33.100]   salvation without reference to sin to those who eagerly await Him."
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.780]   Again, there's a lot to unpack there, but just to highlight, "Those who eagerly await
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:38.780]   Him."
[00:44:38.780 --> 00:44:39.780]   I love the word "eagerly."
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:45.740]   Are you eager?
[00:44:45.740 --> 00:44:47.740]   But the point is here, it's just once.
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:49.780]   And once you're there, there is no second chance.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:50.780]   That's it.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:51.780]   It's like the parable.
[00:44:51.780 --> 00:44:53.660]   You go to buy the oil and it's too late.
[00:44:53.660 --> 00:44:55.980]   You miss His coming.
[00:44:55.980 --> 00:45:00.340]   J.C. Ryle says this, "Tomorrow is the devil's day, but today is God's.
[00:45:00.340 --> 00:45:05.380]   Satan does not care how spiritual your intentions are or how holy your resolutions, if only
[00:45:05.380 --> 00:45:09.540]   they are determined to be done tomorrow, because tomorrow may not come."
[00:45:09.540 --> 00:45:13.500]   And it's exposing something about your heart today anyway.
[00:45:13.500 --> 00:45:14.500]   That day is final.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.980]   In Ecclesiastes 9, verse 12, I thought this was a good picture.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:20.140]   "Moreover, man does not know his time.
[00:45:20.140 --> 00:45:23.780]   Like fish caught in a treacherous net and birds trapped in a snare, so the sons of men
[00:45:23.780 --> 00:45:27.460]   are ensnared in an evil time when it suddenly falls on them."
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:28.460]   That word "suddenly."
[00:45:28.460 --> 00:45:32.740]   It's this fish that's swimming around, eating whatever food it could find, floating around
[00:45:32.740 --> 00:45:36.900]   in the ocean, but one day it eats the wrong one and then it's caught and then his life
[00:45:36.900 --> 00:45:38.460]   is over.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:39.460]   There is no second chance.
[00:45:39.460 --> 00:45:41.060]   There's a finality to it.
[00:45:41.060 --> 00:45:44.420]   And the fish knows when he's sitting there on the fisherman's boat.
[00:45:44.420 --> 00:45:46.420]   That's it.
[00:45:46.420 --> 00:45:48.940]   The word "suddenly."
[00:45:48.940 --> 00:45:53.780]   It means unexpected.
[00:45:53.780 --> 00:45:56.140]   Back to 2 Peter 3, look at verse 1.
[00:45:56.140 --> 00:45:59.860]   "This is now, beloved, the second letter I am writing to you in which I am stirring
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:04.380]   up your sincere mind by way of reminder that you should remember the words," listen to
[00:46:04.380 --> 00:46:08.620]   that, "you should remember the words spoken beforehand by the holy prophets and the commandment
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:12.260]   of the Lord and Savior, spoken by your apostles.
[00:46:12.260 --> 00:46:16.020]   Know this, first of all, that in the last days mockers will come with their mocking,
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:20.220]   following after their own lusts, and saying, 'Where is the promise of his coming?
[00:46:20.220 --> 00:46:23.500]   For ever since the fathers fell asleep and all continues just as it was from the beginning
[00:46:23.500 --> 00:46:24.500]   of creation.'"
[00:46:24.500 --> 00:46:32.740]   It's not the same, but I kind of get the feel of when the people are killing Jesus on Calvary
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:35.340]   and they're saying, "Who's going to save you?
[00:46:35.340 --> 00:46:39.500]   Save yourself," challenging him.
[00:46:39.500 --> 00:46:45.460]   It says, "In the last days," he's not around, he's not coming, all is continuing.
[00:46:45.460 --> 00:46:48.540]   And verse 5, "For when they maintain this, it escapes their notice that by the word of
[00:46:48.540 --> 00:46:53.940]   God the heavens existed long ago and the earth was formed out of water and by water, through
[00:46:53.940 --> 00:46:57.300]   which the world at that time was destroyed, being flooded with water.
[00:46:57.300 --> 00:47:01.460]   But by his word, the present heavens and earth are being reserved for fire, kept for the
[00:47:01.460 --> 00:47:03.780]   day of judgment and destruction of ungodly men."
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:08.020]   I mean, the people just look and laugh.
[00:47:08.020 --> 00:47:11.500]   The scary thing about this passage is that these people are people who believe in God
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:19.180]   and they're saying, "Where is he?"
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:23.100]   I was watching this movie, I highly don't recommend it, it's called 2012.
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:25.260]   It's a movie about the end of the world.
[00:47:25.260 --> 00:47:28.060]   But there's this one picture in the middle of it that was kind of funny.
[00:47:28.060 --> 00:47:32.020]   It's a homeless man saying the end is near.
[00:47:32.020 --> 00:47:37.460]   And then it's in the beginning of the movie before anybody really, I think this was 2012,
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:40.620]   anyway, it's in the beginning of the movie before anyone realizes that the world is coming
[00:47:40.620 --> 00:47:41.620]   to an end.
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.540]   You know the beginning of a movie where they do character development?
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:45.540]   It's that.
[00:47:45.540 --> 00:47:49.020]   And you're like, the foreboding, the eeriness of it, everything seems so normal, but you
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:52.260]   know that the movie is called 2012, it's the end of the world then.
[00:47:52.260 --> 00:47:53.460]   And so you know, right?
[00:47:53.460 --> 00:47:57.180]   And so they're just walking by this homeless man, the end is near.
[00:47:57.180 --> 00:48:00.380]   Prepare to meet thy maker, that kind of thing.
[00:48:00.380 --> 00:48:04.700]   And he's being shown as a crazy man, right?
[00:48:04.700 --> 00:48:08.380]   Holding up this sign, like, "Prepare to meet thy maker."
[00:48:08.380 --> 00:48:09.380]   What's so wrong with that sign?
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:10.980]   Isn't that a great sign?
[00:48:10.980 --> 00:48:14.940]   Isn't that such a truthful sign?
[00:48:14.940 --> 00:48:20.740]   But the reality is, later on, when everything starts going crazy, it's like all these storms,
[00:48:20.740 --> 00:48:23.300]   waters come, tsunamis and earthquakes and stuff.
[00:48:23.300 --> 00:48:24.300]   You see that?
[00:48:24.300 --> 00:48:26.980]   You see in the middle of all the chaos, the homeless man just standing right there in
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:30.140]   the middle, just holding that sign.
[00:48:30.140 --> 00:48:35.140]   I shouldn't be laughing at it, but it's kind of funny, you know?
[00:48:35.140 --> 00:48:40.740]   It's like, "Oh!"
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:50.220]   Because when we see clearly, like, yeah, like when we see the world being torn apart, it's
[00:48:50.220 --> 00:48:51.900]   like, "Oh!"
[00:48:51.900 --> 00:48:56.180]   That's what we see in the book of Revelation.
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:49:03.940]   But you know what's so crazy about the stubbornness and the rebellion of sinful hearts is that
[00:49:03.940 --> 00:49:08.980]   in the middle of that, they still refuse to bow the knee before God.
[00:49:08.980 --> 00:49:11.420]   It's not worth time.
[00:49:11.420 --> 00:49:18.100]   That would have changed anything about unbelieving hearts.
[00:49:18.100 --> 00:49:20.020]   This day will come suddenly.
[00:49:20.020 --> 00:49:23.260]   Matthew 25 is in the middle of the Olivet Discourse when Jesus is talking about the
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:25.820]   end time.
[00:49:25.820 --> 00:49:29.900]   And the point is clear because of the repetition in the Olivet Discourse.
[00:49:29.900 --> 00:49:33.420]   And chapter 24, verse 36, "But of that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels
[00:49:33.420 --> 00:49:35.660]   of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father alone."
[00:49:35.660 --> 00:49:39.620]   Verse 42, "Therefore be on the alert, for you do not know which day your Lord is coming."
[00:49:39.620 --> 00:49:42.540]   Verse 44, "For this reason, you also must be ready, for the Son of Man is coming at
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:44.500]   an hour when you do not think you will."
[00:49:44.500 --> 00:49:48.060]   Verse 50, "The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him
[00:49:48.060 --> 00:49:49.860]   at an hour which he does not know."
[00:49:49.860 --> 00:49:54.620]   The word is, the word I think we can captivate here is suddenly.
[00:49:54.620 --> 00:49:59.020]   You don't know when it's going to come.
[00:49:59.020 --> 00:50:03.220]   I realized coming up out of that initial time of quarantine back in April, a lot more people
[00:50:03.220 --> 00:50:04.220]   seemed ready.
[00:50:04.220 --> 00:50:12.260]   It felt, I was very encouraged until I realized a couple months later, oh, things go back
[00:50:12.260 --> 00:50:13.260]   to normal.
[00:50:13.260 --> 00:50:15.820]   I mean, we know that about our lives, right?
[00:50:15.820 --> 00:50:19.940]   When something crazy happens in our life, there's some, we get stricken with some illness
[00:50:19.940 --> 00:50:23.640]   or disease and like, whoa, and you start living soberly.
[00:50:23.640 --> 00:50:25.860]   But soon after that, things go back to normal.
[00:50:25.860 --> 00:50:26.860]   We know that.
[00:50:26.860 --> 00:50:29.660]   We go to a funeral and we're like, oh my gosh, I have to change the way I live.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:32.420]   And we leave the funeral and after a while, we're like, we're going right back to what
[00:50:32.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   we were doing.
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:34.420]   It just happens.
[00:50:34.420 --> 00:50:40.220]   And it's crazy that a worldwide pandemic hit us and months later, we're like, just, it
[00:50:40.220 --> 00:50:42.420]   became normal again.
[00:50:42.420 --> 00:50:48.620]   We just have to wear a mask and be careful.
[00:50:48.620 --> 00:50:53.100]   And when we lose clarity, we again begin to put our sights on things where we once again,
[00:50:53.100 --> 00:50:54.380]   we're like, man, this is sweet time.
[00:50:54.380 --> 00:50:56.340]   I can't wait for Jesus to return.
[00:50:56.340 --> 00:50:59.140]   And now again, we're thinking like, man, I can't wait for the restaurants to open so
[00:50:59.140 --> 00:51:05.260]   I can eat.
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:09.460]   I've heard this term light at the end of the tunnel so many times.
[00:51:09.460 --> 00:51:14.100]   Like, what light?
[00:51:14.100 --> 00:51:18.940]   I've seen pictures of people getting vaccines and the whole room sobbing as if this is their
[00:51:18.940 --> 00:51:21.940]   salvation.
[00:51:21.940 --> 00:51:26.020]   To the unbeliever, this thing will not save them.
[00:51:26.020 --> 00:51:33.300]   God light, like the end will come and the end comes.
[00:51:33.300 --> 00:51:38.020]   And people think like, oh, like where's God or I'll do it tomorrow or I don't know, you
[00:51:38.020 --> 00:51:39.740]   know, like just, I'll just continue to living in that.
[00:51:39.740 --> 00:51:40.740]   I don't know.
[00:51:40.740 --> 00:51:45.140]   I don't think the bridesmaids are waiting for the groom to come or like living all like,
[00:51:45.140 --> 00:51:47.820]   you know, like, what do you call that?
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:50.700]   Like with malicious intent and all that kind of stuff.
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:53.740]   I think they were just kind of living their lives going like, ah, I should be ready.
[00:51:53.740 --> 00:51:59.220]   And as they went, like it just hit them.
[00:51:59.220 --> 00:52:02.700]   For any unbelieving person that's listening today, it will come.
[00:52:02.700 --> 00:52:08.140]   And what are you going to do when you meet your maker?
[00:52:08.140 --> 00:52:15.280]   There is no light at the end of the tunnel at that point.
[00:52:15.280 --> 00:52:18.780]   We cannot live in simple anticipation for our world to go back to the way it was because
[00:52:18.780 --> 00:52:26.060]   at the end, the world is promised to be consumed.
[00:52:26.060 --> 00:52:32.060]   To conclude, I realized as I studied this passage, the final, for a final application
[00:52:32.060 --> 00:52:37.700]   point, just one, because this is the last sermon of the Sunday sermon of the year.
[00:52:37.700 --> 00:52:40.700]   I'm sorry that it's a little bit heavier, but I thought like it was just so like good
[00:52:40.700 --> 00:52:42.860]   thinking about the past year.
[00:52:42.860 --> 00:52:44.180]   Here's the final application point.
[00:52:44.180 --> 00:52:50.060]   I think the temptation is going to be to look at this and try to identify who I am.
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.060]   Am I the wise or the foolish?
[00:52:52.060 --> 00:52:53.820]   I think that's going to be the temptation.
[00:52:53.820 --> 00:52:58.220]   Can I ask you today not to try to just sit there and as a final application to identify
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:53:04.100]   who you are, but actually to take this as an exhortation.
[00:53:04.100 --> 00:53:06.500]   So not identification, but exhortation.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:10.440]   Do you know what I mean by this?
[00:53:10.440 --> 00:53:13.820]   Not to sit there and say like, "Man, I'm living like I'm a fool.
[00:53:13.820 --> 00:53:17.140]   I think I might be a foolish person or I think I'm a wise person."
[00:53:17.140 --> 00:53:19.300]   You're trying to convince yourself one way or the other.
[00:53:19.300 --> 00:53:24.420]   Instead of doing that, the whole point is he's coming soon.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.620]   So prepare.
[00:53:27.620 --> 00:53:29.880]   There's no reason to live in guilt here.
[00:53:29.880 --> 00:53:32.780]   There's no reason to look back and go like, "Oh my gosh, I'm so terrible because of this
[00:53:32.780 --> 00:53:33.780]   and that."
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:42.880]   No, no, no, the point is here like if you hear his voice today, then listen.
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:46.640]   Let this week be different.
[00:53:46.640 --> 00:53:48.800]   Wake up tomorrow and say, "This world is passing away.
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:50.880]   I'm not going to live for it.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:53.360]   I can't wait for Christ to come."
[00:53:53.360 --> 00:53:54.360]   Just do that.
[00:53:54.360 --> 00:53:59.200]   In Hebrews 2 and 3, when it talks about today if you hear his voice, "Do not harden your
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:00.800]   hearts as in the time of the wilderness."
[00:54:00.800 --> 00:54:01.800]   It's that.
[00:54:01.800 --> 00:54:04.300]   You don't have to sit there and be like, "Oh, just continue to live in the past."
[00:54:04.300 --> 00:54:07.420]   Just like today if you hear the voice, listen.
[00:54:07.420 --> 00:54:11.260]   It's a lot simpler than we make it where sometimes we think like we have to do something to our
[00:54:11.260 --> 00:54:13.820]   hearts like, "No, no, no, it's just obey.
[00:54:13.820 --> 00:54:14.820]   It's just surrender."
[00:54:14.820 --> 00:54:19.980]   I wanted to leave that as the final exhortation.
[00:54:19.980 --> 00:54:25.100]   Because at the end as we usher in, I'm really excited for the New Year's Eve service.
[00:54:25.100 --> 00:54:29.100]   Even though it's going to be online, I'm very excited for the coming year.
[00:54:29.100 --> 00:54:33.100]   Even though the arbitrary calendar date changing, whatever, right?
[00:54:33.100 --> 00:54:36.060]   But still, it's a time to really reflect together.
[00:54:36.060 --> 00:54:37.060]   I love that.
[00:54:37.060 --> 00:54:39.580]   I love New Year's because we can reflect together.
[00:54:39.580 --> 00:54:50.140]   I think there's power when Christians collectively as a body unified do it together.
[00:54:50.140 --> 00:54:52.300]   Let's live for that kingdom.
[00:54:52.300 --> 00:54:56.180]   As opposed to all of us just living our own lives, trying our best to, you know.
[00:54:56.180 --> 00:54:57.180]   Thank you.
[00:54:57.180 --> 00:54:59.180]   All right, let me break.
