[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for giving us this evening to be able to come together with
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:14.520]   brothers and sisters to be able to share, to pray, to provoke one another on toward
[00:00:14.520 --> 00:00:16.320]   love and good deeds.
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:21.440]   We pray that the study of Isaiah, Lord, even though at times it may be confusing, I pray
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:26.460]   that your heart and your will and your desire, who you are, your glory, all of these things
[00:00:26.460 --> 00:00:31.860]   may be revealed, that the more we see of who you are and how you work, that they would
[00:00:31.860 --> 00:00:36.760]   instill in us a greater confidence, Lord God, of all the promises that you give.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:42.020]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to lead us, that our hearts may be filled with you, and we
[00:00:42.020 --> 00:00:46.320]   ask for your blessing over this time in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:49.720]   So next week is going to be a wrap-up study.
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:55.340]   So this week there is no homework because we're done with chapter 56, and so we're going
[00:00:55.340 --> 00:01:00.000]   to be taking a break, a three-week break after next week.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:01.900]   So next week is just going to be review.
[00:01:01.900 --> 00:01:04.920]   We're going to be going over, again, all of it, not just the session that we did.
[00:01:04.920 --> 00:01:11.580]   We're going to do an overview study just to kind of get you to remember some of the things
[00:01:11.580 --> 00:01:12.580]   that we studied.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:17.420]   I do want to encourage you to take some time to review your notes, you know, to go back
[00:01:17.420 --> 00:01:22.840]   and just, you don't have to know it in detail, but just go through it, and then your memory
[00:01:22.840 --> 00:01:25.560]   verses that you have, try to do your best to go back and ...
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:31.220]   Next week, how many of your groups have not done the snacks?
[00:01:31.220 --> 00:01:32.220]   Okay.
[00:01:32.220 --> 00:01:35.860]   Raise your hand if your group hasn't done the snacks yet.
[00:01:35.860 --> 00:01:36.860]   Okay.
[00:01:36.860 --> 00:01:38.860]   If you're doing it today, don't raise your hand.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:39.860]   Okay.
[00:01:39.860 --> 00:01:41.600]   The ones who haven't done it yet, raise your hand, raise your hand.
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:46.860]   So we have one, two, whichever, three, four, five, six groups?
[00:01:46.860 --> 00:01:47.860]   Okay.
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:48.860]   Raise your hand.
[00:01:48.860 --> 00:01:49.860]   Let me see how many of you guys are getting.
[00:01:49.860 --> 00:01:54.860]   One, two, three, four, five, six groups.
[00:01:54.860 --> 00:01:55.860]   Okay.
[00:01:55.860 --> 00:01:58.860]   Yeah, I counted you guys, right?
[00:01:58.860 --> 00:01:59.860]   All right.
[00:01:59.860 --> 00:02:05.860]   So, all of your groups who didn't do it, we'll all do it all at once next week, okay?
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.860]   So, it is our finale.
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:10.860]   Yeah.
[00:02:10.860 --> 00:02:11.860]   So, it is our finale.
[00:02:11.860 --> 00:02:13.860]   So, typically, we only have two groups.
[00:02:13.860 --> 00:02:18.860]   So, you guys are triple that, which means it would be, it should be triple the, triple
[00:02:18.860 --> 00:02:22.860]   the amount, triple the flavor, triple everything, okay?
[00:02:22.860 --> 00:02:28.860]   So, so please come, again, all of you guys could, hey, let me see.
[00:02:28.860 --> 00:02:33.860]   I need to know who you are so that we can better coordinate, so we don't just have all
[00:02:33.860 --> 00:02:34.860]   drinks.
[00:02:34.860 --> 00:02:39.860]   Can, can one of your groups take charge so that you guys can coordinate what you guys
[00:02:39.860 --> 00:02:40.860]   are going to be bringing?
[00:02:40.860 --> 00:02:41.860]   Can you raise your hand again?
[00:02:41.860 --> 00:02:43.860]   Does somebody want to volunteer?
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:47.860]   Nobody's raising, don't put it down.
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:48.860]   Don't put it down.
[00:02:48.860 --> 00:02:56.860]   Any group want to volunteer to coordinate and serve the kingdom of God for His glory?
[00:02:56.860 --> 00:03:06.860]   Earn rewards in heaven?
[00:03:06.860 --> 00:03:10.860]   Oh, their, their hands went up first, okay, so the glory goes to your group over there.
[00:03:10.860 --> 00:03:11.860]   All right.
[00:03:11.860 --> 00:03:14.860]   So, can you jot down which groups they are so that you'll know who they are?
[00:03:14.860 --> 00:03:17.860]   So, can you raise your hand if you're one of the groups that's going to be bringing
[00:03:17.860 --> 00:03:18.860]   snacks?
[00:03:18.860 --> 00:03:22.860]   So, can you guys, can you stand up and see who they are and jot it down?
[00:03:22.860 --> 00:03:23.860]   Okay.
[00:03:23.860 --> 00:03:26.860]   Raise your hand until they get, they get you.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:40.860]   Okay, this group here, up here.
[00:03:40.860 --> 00:03:41.860]   Okay, you got it?
[00:03:41.860 --> 00:03:42.860]   There's six groups.
[00:03:42.860 --> 00:03:43.860]   You got six groups?
[00:03:43.860 --> 00:03:44.860]   Okay.
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:47.860]   So, if you guys can do us a favor and coordinate, okay?
[00:03:47.860 --> 00:03:48.860]   That's for next week.
[00:03:48.860 --> 00:03:53.860]   So, next, next week, because it is a review, we're going to spend some extended time worship,
[00:03:53.860 --> 00:03:56.860]   praying, and then take extended time fellowship at the end, okay?
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:01.860]   And then after that, we're going to take at least three, possibly four weeks off, but
[00:04:01.860 --> 00:04:04.860]   right now the plan is to take three weeks off, okay?
[00:04:04.860 --> 00:04:08.860]   And then there's some other things that we're working on right now, but we, it's not finalized
[00:04:08.860 --> 00:04:10.860]   yet, so we won't let you know.
[00:04:10.860 --> 00:04:16.860]   But we'll let you know as that happens, okay?
[00:04:16.860 --> 00:04:20.860]   All right, so let's start.
[00:04:20.860 --> 00:04:24.860]   And those of you who are coordinating, if you are facilitating and leading the small
[00:04:24.860 --> 00:04:29.860]   group, you're going to be getting an email sometime early next week, just to kind of,
[00:04:29.860 --> 00:04:33.860]   you know, asking for some feedback and for some direction for the following week, so
[00:04:33.860 --> 00:04:34.860]   just look out for that.
[00:04:34.860 --> 00:04:40.860]   And please, if you see the email coming from me, respond ASAP, okay?
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.860]   The habit is, I get about half of people to respond right away, and the other half take
[00:04:44.860 --> 00:04:45.860]   like two to three weeks.
[00:04:45.860 --> 00:04:50.860]   So, if you get an email from me, please respond as quickly as you can, okay?
[00:04:50.860 --> 00:04:52.860]   And this is for the small group facilitators.
[00:04:52.860 --> 00:04:57.860]   All right, so let's look at Chapter 5065.
[00:04:57.860 --> 00:05:01.860]   I doubled up because we had two weeks on Thursday and Friday, so hopefully you had more time
[00:05:01.860 --> 00:05:02.860]   to dig.
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:07.860]   Okay, so if we look at Chapter 65, we're looking at the very end of the book of Isaiah,
[00:05:07.860 --> 00:05:13.860]   and he is prophesying about the promise of restoration at the end times.
[00:05:13.860 --> 00:05:18.860]   We said that it could be in the time of the millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ.
[00:05:18.860 --> 00:05:21.860]   It could also be talking about the very end, right?
[00:05:21.860 --> 00:05:27.860]   So, if you look at Chapter 65, it is a rebuke toward the nation of Israel.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:34.860]   So, if you've noticed, Chapter 65 and 66, the tone of it is rebuke, right?
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:39.860]   Up to this point, he's been talking about restoration and promise, but he also is reminding
[00:05:39.860 --> 00:05:44.860]   the nation of Israel because even though he's prophesying about the end times, Isaiah is
[00:05:44.860 --> 00:05:49.860]   prophesying to a specific group of people in a historical context, right?
[00:05:49.860 --> 00:05:54.860]   So, during Isaiah's prophecy, what was happening to the nation of Israel?
[00:05:54.860 --> 00:05:56.860]   Do you remember?
[00:05:56.860 --> 00:06:00.860]   Those of you guys who were with us, either through any part of the study or in the very
[00:06:00.860 --> 00:06:02.860]   beginning of the book of Isaiah?
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:03.860]   Hmm?
[00:06:03.860 --> 00:06:05.860]   They were prospering.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.860]   What else was happening?
[00:06:09.860 --> 00:06:17.860]   What is one sin that kept on being repeated over and over and God seems to keep pointing out?
[00:06:17.860 --> 00:06:18.860]   False religion, right?
[00:06:18.860 --> 00:06:25.860]   They were very active, and because they were living in a time of peace, their confidence
[00:06:25.860 --> 00:06:30.860]   was in other nations or their wealth or whatever it was that they had, so it wasn't like they
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:33.860]   were going out and outright worshipping idols.
[00:06:33.860 --> 00:06:38.860]   They were very busy worshipping at the temple, but they weren't right with God.
[00:06:38.860 --> 00:06:42.860]   What God was calling for was not superficial worship, but true repentance.
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:49.860]   And so, up to this point, up to Chapter, remember, Chapter 39 up to this point, it's all promises
[00:06:49.860 --> 00:06:51.860]   of God's restoration, right?
[00:06:51.860 --> 00:06:56.860]   And then, but at the very end, he comes back into the historical context reminding them,
[00:06:56.860 --> 00:06:58.860]   but don't forget, right?
[00:06:58.860 --> 00:07:01.860]   God is not going to sweep their sins just under the rug.
[00:07:01.860 --> 00:07:05.860]   Even though he's talking about restoration, they're not off the hook, right?
[00:07:05.860 --> 00:07:06.860]   God is going to deal with that.
[00:07:06.860 --> 00:07:10.860]   So when he comes, sin is going to be dealt with, but he's also going to be restoring
[00:07:10.860 --> 00:07:11.860]   at the same time.
[00:07:11.860 --> 00:07:16.860]   So that's where we are in Chapter 65, where he's talking to, in 65, he says, "I was ready
[00:07:16.860 --> 00:07:18.860]   to be sought by those who did not ask for me.
[00:07:18.860 --> 00:07:21.860]   I was ready to be found by those who did not seek me."
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:25.860]   Who is he referring to?
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:28.860]   I mean, as in the whole context, it's definitely the nation of Israel.
[00:07:28.860 --> 00:07:33.860]   But the first verse when he says, "I said, 'Here am I, here am I,' to a nation that
[00:07:33.860 --> 00:07:35.860]   was not called by my name."
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:40.860]   So if you look at your sheet, I have the wrong reference there.
[00:07:40.860 --> 00:07:41.860]   It says Isaiah 10, 20, 21.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:47.860]   It's actually Romans 10, 20, 21, where Paul actually cites this verse.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:50.860]   So turn your Bibles to Romans 10, 20, and 21.
[00:07:50.860 --> 00:07:58.860]   And I think it'll kind of maybe shed light on how we ought to understand this text.
[00:07:58.860 --> 00:08:00.860]   Romans 10, 20, 21.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:10.860]   Can somebody read that out loud?
[00:08:10.860 --> 00:08:11.860]   Joseph.
[00:08:11.860 --> 00:08:13.860]   Go ahead.
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:23.860]   [inaudible]
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:24.860]   Okay.
[00:08:24.860 --> 00:08:32.860]   So in Romans 10, 20, and 21, what is verse 1 in reference to?
[00:08:32.860 --> 00:08:33.860]   Gentiles.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:34.860]   Right.
[00:08:34.860 --> 00:08:38.860]   He's going to open up the kingdom to the Gentiles, people who are not called.
[00:08:38.860 --> 00:08:40.860]   They were not privileged like the nation of Israel.
[00:08:40.860 --> 00:08:44.860]   But these people, the nation of Israel that God was holding his hand out all this time
[00:08:44.860 --> 00:08:46.860]   through the history, they were rebellious.
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:49.860]   In other words, that the judgment that they deserve is much greater.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:56.860]   Right?
[00:08:56.860 --> 00:08:59.860]   So how does he describe these people?
[00:08:59.860 --> 00:09:03.860]   He says they are a rebellious people.
[00:09:03.860 --> 00:09:05.860]   And I'm just going to highlight a few of them.
[00:09:05.860 --> 00:09:07.860]   They walk in a way that is not good.
[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:12.860]   And the way he describes why they're not good is because they follow their own devices.
[00:09:12.860 --> 00:09:15.860]   Even in the way they worship God.
[00:09:15.860 --> 00:09:16.860]   Right?
[00:09:16.860 --> 00:09:22.860]   They're giving sacrifices, but they're not the things that God was demanding.
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:26.860]   Remember when I said God does the lights and loyalty rather than sacrifice and then burnt offering.
[00:09:26.860 --> 00:09:28.860]   Right?
[00:09:28.860 --> 00:09:30.860]   And rather the knowledge of God.
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:32.860]   That's what God desires.
[00:09:32.860 --> 00:09:37.860]   So what they were doing was, well, this part they want to keep to themselves.
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:40.860]   They weren't willing to repent, so they were offering all this other stuff.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:41.860]   Right?
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:46.860]   And so this can easily happen where you're in church busy serving God.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.860]   And then because you're serving God in the church, it kind of somehow excuses all the other stuff that God is demanding.
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:58.860]   But in the nation of Israel, he's basically saying that you're busy serving me at the temple,
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:07.860]   but that's not the thing that God desired from them.
[00:10:07.860 --> 00:10:08.860]   They provoke him to his face.
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.860]   How does he do that?
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.860]   How does the nation of Israel do that?
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:15.860]   They sacrifice in gardens and make offerings on bricks.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:19.860]   In other words, they were worshiping God, but not the way that God told them to.
[00:10:19.860 --> 00:10:26.860]   Remember, what was the sin of the Northern Kingdom?
[00:10:26.860 --> 00:10:30.860]   Okay, how specifically?
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:35.860]   Okay, but specifically?
[00:10:35.860 --> 00:10:39.860]   What was the… remember when the Southern Kingdom and Northern Kingdom split?
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:45.860]   There was a particular sin that they brought in from the very beginning.
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:50.860]   I mean, basically what you said is right, but more specific.
[00:10:50.860 --> 00:10:52.860]   No, that was the Southern Kingdom.
[00:10:52.860 --> 00:10:53.860]   Right?
[00:10:53.860 --> 00:11:00.860]   The Northern Kingdom was where, remember, they were concerned that they were going to come down to Jerusalem to give sacrifices.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.860]   So he makes a golden calf worship and say, "This is Yahweh."
[00:11:04.860 --> 00:11:07.860]   And then he set up a place of worship outside of Jerusalem.
[00:11:07.860 --> 00:11:08.860]   Right?
[00:11:08.860 --> 00:11:12.860]   But the Southern Kingdom's problem was they kept on sacrificing in high places.
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:13.860]   Right?
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.860]   In a place where God did not prescribe.
[00:11:15.860 --> 00:11:18.860]   So they would keep on making sacrifices the way they wanted to.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:23.860]   In the name of Yahweh, saying that this is sacrifice for God, but it wasn't at the temple.
[00:11:23.860 --> 00:11:25.860]   It wasn't at the altar that God prescribed.
[00:11:25.860 --> 00:11:26.860]   Right?
[00:11:26.860 --> 00:11:30.860]   So every time, even though they were sacrificing for God, what does God say?
[00:11:30.860 --> 00:11:34.860]   Every time they sacrifice, He said, "They are provoking Him."
[00:11:34.860 --> 00:11:35.860]   Right?
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:39.860]   They're worshiping Him, but their worship is provoking Him.
[00:11:39.860 --> 00:11:40.860]   Right?
[00:11:40.860 --> 00:11:42.860]   Isn't that what Isaiah says in the beginning?
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:45.860]   That your sacrifice, your song, they're detestable.
[00:11:45.860 --> 00:11:47.860]   You're evil assembly.
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:48.860]   Right?
[00:11:48.860 --> 00:11:50.860]   And it's all done in the name of Yahweh.
[00:11:50.860 --> 00:11:56.860]   And yet God, instead of worshiping and being honored, it says God is angered by it.
[00:11:56.860 --> 00:12:01.860]   And now, again, so He starts out in the historical context, remember, in chapter 1, chapter 2?
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:08.860]   And now He's wrapping up and He's going back to Israel's context.
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:11.860]   They continue to spend their nights in secret places.
[00:12:11.860 --> 00:12:12.860]   They eat pigs.
[00:12:12.860 --> 00:12:17.860]   Again, all of these things are things that God said would make them unclean.
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.860]   Right?
[00:12:19.860 --> 00:12:23.860]   And then, again, another thing we wonder how they consider themselves holy.
[00:12:23.860 --> 00:12:32.860]   Even though God is calling them to repentance, if they don't see themselves as sinners, what could they repent of?
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.860]   Why didn't they see themselves—why did they see themselves as holy?
[00:12:37.860 --> 00:12:38.860]   Because they were busy.
[00:12:38.860 --> 00:12:40.860]   They were busy at the temple.
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:41.860]   They were busy making sacrifices.
[00:12:41.860 --> 00:12:46.860]   So, because they were busy doing God's work, they thought they were holy.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:51.860]   And that's what caused them to have hardened hearts.
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:54.860]   They didn't see themselves like the Gentiles.
[00:12:54.860 --> 00:12:55.860]   Right?
[00:12:55.860 --> 00:12:59.860]   So, whenever God prescribed repentance and judgment, it's like, yeah, those people.
[00:12:59.860 --> 00:13:01.860]   But they didn't see themselves in that place.
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:08.860]   And God is saying, this is the very reason why judgment is going to come.
[00:13:08.860 --> 00:13:09.860]   So, isn't that interesting?
[00:13:09.860 --> 00:13:16.860]   I mean, when you take your time to actually study and then let the Word of God judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart,
[00:13:16.860 --> 00:13:21.860]   it's like, people who are in the church are not typically guilty of idol worship.
[00:13:21.860 --> 00:13:22.860]   Right?
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:29.860]   People who are typically in decent churches are not guilty of prosperity gospel or the false gospel.
[00:13:29.860 --> 00:13:35.860]   That's not what we're—that's typically—that's not the danger that is knocking at our door constantly.
[00:13:35.860 --> 00:13:40.860]   These are the things that we're—if we're not careful—can easily creep in.
[00:13:40.860 --> 00:13:43.860]   Being busy in the things of the Lord.
[00:13:43.860 --> 00:13:44.860]   Right?
[00:13:44.860 --> 00:13:45.860]   Being busy giving sacrifices.
[00:13:45.860 --> 00:13:50.860]   And so, you kind of get to a point where the Word of God is no longer molding you.
[00:13:50.860 --> 00:13:56.860]   And you see every time you read the Word of God, you're always seeing it at the lens of who needs to hear this.
[00:13:56.860 --> 00:13:57.860]   Right?
[00:13:57.860 --> 00:13:59.860]   So, we're not being transformed.
[00:13:59.860 --> 00:14:00.860]   We're not being sanctified.
[00:14:00.860 --> 00:14:03.860]   And so, again, that's where the nation of Israel is.
[00:14:03.860 --> 00:14:07.860]   And I think that's why the book of Isaiah is very relevant to our culture, like church culture.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:08.860]   Right?
[00:14:08.860 --> 00:14:14.860]   What illustration does he use in verse 8?
[00:14:14.860 --> 00:14:15.860]   Right?
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:25.860]   So, if you look at verse 8, it says, "Thus says the Lord, 'As a new wine is found in the cluster, and they say, 'Do not destroy it, for there is blessing in it.'
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:29.860]   So I will do for My servant's sake and not destroy them all."
[00:14:29.860 --> 00:14:33.860]   So, again, over and over again, he talks about a remnant.
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.860]   And as a result of the remnant, that God will not completely destroy them.
[00:14:38.860 --> 00:14:39.860]   Right?
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:41.860]   What story does that remind you of?
[00:14:41.860 --> 00:14:47.860]   Where God says He's angry to the nation of Israel, but He will not destroy them completely because of the remnant.
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:48.860]   Right?
[00:14:48.860 --> 00:14:49.860]   Because of the few righteous.
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:51.860]   What story does that remind you of?
[00:14:51.860 --> 00:14:55.860]   The wheat and the tares?
[00:14:55.860 --> 00:14:57.860]   Somebody said it.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.860]   Story of Lot, right?
[00:14:59.860 --> 00:15:04.860]   Where Abraham is pleading with God, "What if there's 50? What if there's 45? What if there's 40?"
[00:15:04.860 --> 00:15:07.860]   And then He kind of brings them down all the way to 10.
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:09.860]   If there's 10, would you still destroy it?
[00:15:09.860 --> 00:15:11.860]   And He says, "No, no, I wouldn't destroy even 10."
[00:15:11.860 --> 00:15:13.860]   So they couldn't even find 10.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:14.860]   Right?
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:19.860]   So this story, again, this thing reminds us of the story of Lot.
[00:15:19.860 --> 00:15:24.860]   Where Abraham is pleading, and it says, "God would not destroy the righteous with the unrighteous."
[00:15:24.860 --> 00:15:29.860]   He's saying there is still hope for the nation of Israel because of the remnant.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:30.860]   Right?
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:33.860]   It's not all of Israel, but the remnant.
[00:15:33.860 --> 00:15:40.860]   How does He describe the distinction between the servant and those who are rebellious?
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:42.860]   The remnant and those who are not?
[00:15:42.860 --> 00:15:46.860]   "My servants shall eat, but they shall go hungry."
[00:15:50.860 --> 00:15:54.860]   So these are the faithful versus the unfaithful.
[00:15:54.860 --> 00:15:58.860]   There's not a distinction between the wise and the unwise, the rich and the poor.
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:05.860]   There's not a distinction between the talented and the untalented, the hardworking and the not hardworking.
[00:16:05.860 --> 00:16:10.860]   This is just a distinction between faithful and unfaithful people.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.860]   That God's going to feed them, but the unfaithful, they will go hungry.
[00:16:14.860 --> 00:16:18.860]   "My servants shall drink, but they shall go thirsty."
[00:16:18.860 --> 00:16:20.860]   Right?
[00:16:20.860 --> 00:16:22.860]   So what does this tell us?
[00:16:22.860 --> 00:16:24.860]   Right?
[00:16:24.860 --> 00:16:31.860]   At the end of the day, our very sustenance is dependent upon His grace.
[00:16:31.860 --> 00:16:40.860]   Their food, their drink, their very essence of their joy is in God's hands.
[00:16:43.860 --> 00:16:48.860]   So when the nation of Israel was looking for their shalom, to be blessed by God,
[00:16:48.860 --> 00:16:53.860]   in the end, God says, "The only way that you're going to have shalom is to be right with God."
[00:16:53.860 --> 00:16:56.860]   And that's what this reminds us of.
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:17:01.860]   "But you shall cry for pain, of heart shall wail for breaking the spirit,
[00:17:01.860 --> 00:17:06.860]   and shall leave your name to my chosen for a curse, and the Lord will put you to death."
[00:17:08.860 --> 00:17:13.860]   Again, all of this is in God's sovereign hands.
[00:17:13.860 --> 00:17:18.860]   So above working hard, above investing in the right places,
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:21.860]   and networking with the right people,
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:25.860]   the most important thing for any child of God is that he is right with Him.
[00:17:25.860 --> 00:17:29.860]   So if you're not right with Him, it doesn't matter how hard you're working.
[00:17:29.860 --> 00:17:33.860]   It doesn't matter what kind of jobs you have, what major you have, and what tests you pass.
[00:17:33.860 --> 00:17:40.860]   For a child of God, if you're not right with God, there's nothing more important than to first get right with God.
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:47.860]   Because the very essence of our food, our drink, our joy, our life, is in God's sovereign hands.
[00:17:47.860 --> 00:17:50.860]   And that's what God is telling the nation of Israel.
[00:17:50.860 --> 00:18:00.860]   The Lord promises in chapter 65, 17, to create a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:04.860]   What is the difference between the two, if there is any? What is this in description of?
[00:18:04.860 --> 00:18:08.860]   The new heaven and new earth, if you again study through the...
[00:18:08.860 --> 00:18:13.860]   We can make the distinction and say, well, the heaven is the unseen, and the earth is the seen.
[00:18:13.860 --> 00:18:17.860]   The material and the immaterial, right? Or this life or the afterlife.
[00:18:17.860 --> 00:18:23.860]   But generally speaking, new heaven and new earth basically is talking about all of God's creation.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:25.860]   Seen and unseen.
[00:18:25.860 --> 00:18:28.860]   Physical and material.
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:31.860]   So, totality of creation.
[00:18:31.860 --> 00:18:38.860]   So, in other words, everything that went wrong at the fall is going to be restored at the end.
[00:18:38.860 --> 00:18:40.860]   Everything is going to be made new.
[00:18:40.860 --> 00:18:44.860]   Not just a portion, not just a part, but everything.
[00:18:44.860 --> 00:18:49.860]   So, that's what he means in chapter 65, verse 17.
[00:18:49.860 --> 00:18:54.860]   We see this again in 2 Peter 3, 13.
[00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.860]   Can somebody turn your Bible to 2 Peter 3, 13?
[00:18:57.860 --> 00:19:01.860]   [Pause]
[00:19:01.860 --> 00:19:04.860]   If you're there, can you just read it out loud for us?
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:10.860]   And then, if we can have somebody else turn their Bible to Revelations 21, 1.
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.860]   [Pause]
[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:16.860]   Who's there? Okay.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:25.860]   >> I'm 2 Peter 3, 13. But according to the promise, we are waiting for a new heaven and a new earth, to establish righteousness for all.
[00:19:25.860 --> 00:19:31.860]   >> Okay. So, again, Peter encourages the readers about the promise of the new heaven and a new earth
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:37.860]   as the motivation for why we ought to persevere through suffering, why we ought to live and pursue righteousness.
[00:19:37.860 --> 00:19:38.860]   Right?
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:42.860]   Revelation 21, 1.
[00:19:42.860 --> 00:19:43.860]   Okay.
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:51.860]   >> That I saw a new heaven and a new earth. For the first heaven and the first earth were passed away. The sea was no more.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:20:00.860]   >> Okay. So, again, if you look at the end of the book of Revelation, the final state of human history is going to be the promise of a new heaven and a new earth.
[00:20:00.860 --> 00:20:07.860]   Right? So, everything that you and I know that has gone wrong, God is going to restore what He intended and He's going to make it even better.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.860]   And so, when it talks about a new heaven and a new earth, it's always a promise of complete restoration.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:14.860]   Right?
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:18.860]   [Pause]
[00:20:18.860 --> 00:20:21.860]   What is the description of the new heaven and a new earth?
[00:20:21.860 --> 00:20:26.860]   That was the second question.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:32.860]   One of the first things it mentions in verse 20 is that infant will not die early and old men will live a long life.
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:37.860]   [Pause]
[00:20:37.860 --> 00:20:47.860]   I mean, considering the context, you know, of last weekend, you know, I can't help but to think about, you know, how, you know,
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:54.860]   when we're reading this text, and the promise from scripture that all of these horrendous things that human experience,
[00:20:54.860 --> 00:21:02.860]   and that's not the only thing, but obviously that, you know, hardship, suffering, pain, cancer,
[00:21:02.860 --> 00:21:07.860]   all of these things are results of a living in a fallen world.
[00:21:07.860 --> 00:21:08.860]   Right?
[00:21:08.860 --> 00:21:13.860]   And so, there's a cloud of darkness that hovers over all mankind.
[00:21:13.860 --> 00:21:18.860]   And you and I, even though we've been delivered spiritually, we're not home yet.
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:19.860]   Right?
[00:21:19.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   So, because we're not home, we also experience all of this.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:27.860]   And so, he says that at the end, when he comes and he restores everything,
[00:21:27.860 --> 00:21:32.860]   it means all of these things, all of these things that we've suffered, all of these things that we watch other people suffering,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:35.860]   all of these things, he's going to wipe away.
[00:21:35.860 --> 00:21:36.860]   Right?
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:42.860]   So, you know, the hope that we have for mankind is that no matter how bad it is, it's temporary.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:43.860]   It's not permanent.
[00:21:43.860 --> 00:21:45.860]   And that's the hope that we have in Christ.
[00:21:45.860 --> 00:21:53.860]   No matter, you can imagine the worst possible scenario, the most painful thing you can possibly experience on this earth,
[00:21:53.860 --> 00:21:56.860]   but at the end of the day, it's temporary.
[00:21:56.860 --> 00:21:57.860]   Right?
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:21:58.860]   It's momentary.
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:01.860]   Because when he comes, he says he's going to wipe away all of this stuff.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:03.860]   People will enjoy fruits of their labor.
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:05.860]   And that's one of the things...
[00:22:05.860 --> 00:22:12.860]   Sorry to interrupt, but the new heaven and new earth, are we going to be on the new heaven or new earth?
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:13.860]   But here's what I mean.
[00:22:13.860 --> 00:22:21.860]   When I speak to Jehovah Witness, I ask, you know, if you're not part of the 144,000, then why are you a Jehovah Witness?
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:29.860]   They're like the 144,000 are part of the new heaven, the new Jesus, and we good Jehovah Witness get to be on the new earth,
[00:22:29.860 --> 00:22:31.860]   which is called paradise earth.
[00:22:31.860 --> 00:22:34.860]   So, their hope is to make it to the new earth.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   So, we as Christians obviously don't believe that, but how do you explain the new heaven, new earth?
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   I don't understand the whole totality of creation.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:47.860]   Is it like new heaven, new earth?
[00:22:47.860 --> 00:22:51.860]   Is it two separate places where us Christians can have peace?
[00:22:51.860 --> 00:22:57.860]   New heaven and new earth, again, it depends on the context, but most of the time when the Bible describes new heaven and new earth,
[00:22:57.860 --> 00:23:04.860]   I don't think it's meant to be dissected as what is earth and what is, you know, what is new earth, what is new heaven.
[00:23:04.860 --> 00:23:10.860]   It's talking about material and immaterial, all the God of heaven, earth, and under the earth, right?
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.860]   He's talking about God is sovereign over everything, all of creation, things that you know, things that you don't know.
[00:23:16.860 --> 00:23:21.860]   So, when he's talking about new heaven and new earth, he's not saying that he's just going to make the earth new,
[00:23:21.860 --> 00:23:25.860]   he's saying that everything that you know that exists is going to be renewed.
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:30.860]   So, we can sit there and kind of like, well, there's a new heaven looks like this, a new earth looks like that.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:34.860]   I mean, there is a millennial kingdom that, again, I don't want to get into tonight,
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:40.860]   but I don't think, at least in this context, that the reference is talking about, you know,
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:43.860]   this new heaven looks going to look like this and new earth is going to look like this.
[00:23:43.860 --> 00:23:49.860]   It's just in reference to all things. Instead of saying all things, he just says new heaven and new earth.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:57.860]   [Audience member] But in the eternal state of the new heaven and new earth, there will be no more death, right?
[00:23:57.860 --> 00:24:03.860]   So, if there is an infant that will not die early, I mean, I'm really correct that there will be some death.
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:07.860]   [Ross] Yeah, okay. Good. You're paying attention.
[00:24:07.860 --> 00:24:13.860]   I didn't open up the can of worms because I didn't want to get into the millennial.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:17.860]   I just said the end times because I'm just kind of lumping it all together.
[00:24:17.860 --> 00:24:24.860]   So, if you look at it, like, if we start dissecting and say, well, this is a description of after the great white throne judgment
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:29.860]   and then we're in eternity. So, if you read the commentaries, some of the commentaries,
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:35.860]   Douglas Moo believed that the initial part of it is in reference to eternity
[00:24:35.860 --> 00:24:39.860]   and then he gets back into talking about the description of the millennium.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   Okay, so I don't want to get too deep into that because then we're going to go into why does he believe this
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:49.860]   and dissect the words and I don't want to, I'm just going to leave it at this is the end times.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:54.860]   Okay, but that's a good question. We can talk more about it later.
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:24:57.860]   Really, we're getting stuck on this, alright?
[00:24:57.860 --> 00:25:05.860]   [Audience] One more question. So, the text actually says new heavens
[00:25:05.860 --> 00:25:13.860]   and you know how Genesis 1, chapter 1, verse 1 says that the angel God created heavens and new earth.
[00:25:13.860 --> 00:25:18.860]   So, heavens, plural, I'm curious.
[00:25:18.860 --> 00:25:23.860]   Are there more than one heavens? Is that the question?
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:28.860]   [Audience] We can talk about all of them, but yeah, just noticing that it's heavens.
[00:25:28.860 --> 00:25:37.860]   Okay, well, I don't know about that particular reference, but if you look at the description of Yahweh, Elohim,
[00:25:37.860 --> 00:25:41.860]   it's in plural and it's not in singular.
[00:25:41.860 --> 00:25:47.860]   And the reason why it's in plural is that in the ancient nearest writings,
[00:25:47.860 --> 00:25:51.860]   it wasn't because there were like a lot of people look at that and say, "Oh, that's a reference to the Trinity."
[00:25:51.860 --> 00:25:55.860]   It actually was common outside of the Jewish writings.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:26:00.860]   They would do that to show respect, right? Or for the purpose of emphasis.
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:07.860]   So, I don't know about that particular text, but it could just be for the purpose of emphasis that all heavens, all the earth, right?
[00:26:07.860 --> 00:26:12.860]   Not necessarily like multiple heavens or multiple earths.
[00:26:12.860 --> 00:26:16.860]   Just talking about the totality of everything.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:17.860]   [Audience] Pastor Peter?
[00:26:17.860 --> 00:26:23.860]   Yes, we're going to, okay. I was trying so hard to move on. All right.
[00:26:23.860 --> 00:26:28.860]   [Audience] Just one last thing, and it's not really a question, but more to your comment there.
[00:26:28.860 --> 00:26:35.860]   You know, without going into all the details, isn't it true that as it relates to the end times,
[00:26:35.860 --> 00:26:40.860]   some of the things that Jehovah's Witnesses believe, it's not that different than actually what we believe.
[00:26:40.860 --> 00:26:44.860]   You know, there's a lot of differences in obviously what they believe about Jesus Christ,
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:48.860]   but in terms of the new heavens and the new earth, there's actually a lot of similarities.
[00:26:48.860 --> 00:26:53.860]   Yeah, I mean, we believe in a new heaven. I mean, it depends if you're a dispensationalist.
[00:26:53.860 --> 00:26:56.860]   Yeah, non-dispensationalists will disagree with that.
[00:26:56.860 --> 00:27:02.860]   But their difference is they believe that only a hundred, for literal 144,000 people are going to enter,
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:06.860]   and you have to earn your way into that. And so they don't know if they're going to earn it.
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:09.860]   They believe that they have the best chance.
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:17.860]   [Audience] Well, the 144 is already in the new heaven ruling, which is, it stopped like 1921 or 1914, whenever it was.
[00:27:17.860 --> 00:27:21.860]   Their hope now is to get to the new earth, which is what they call paradise earth.
[00:27:21.860 --> 00:27:24.860]   And I'm here wondering as a Christian, where am I going to be?
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:27.860]   Am I going to be in a new heaven, a new earth?
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:33.860]   And then your answer was, new heavens, new earth is the final state of mind for me,
[00:27:33.860 --> 00:27:37.860]   instead of me just, how did you come to that versus like...
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:40.860]   I don't think there's a need to make that distinction,
[00:27:40.860 --> 00:27:45.860]   because everyone who is genuinely in the new earth is going to be in the new heavens.
[00:27:45.860 --> 00:27:50.860]   So you're saying like, some people go to new heaven, some people go to new earth.
[00:27:50.860 --> 00:27:52.860]   That is not the Christian teaching. Okay?
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:56.860]   So if you're making a distinction between a millennium and the eternal state,
[00:27:56.860 --> 00:27:59.860]   the people who are entering into millennium is because they are Christians,
[00:27:59.860 --> 00:28:06.860]   and they are under a physical rule of Christ, or in that thousand year reign of Christ under the Israelites.
[00:28:06.860 --> 00:28:13.860]   But when that thing ends, everybody who is a genuine Christian in the thousand year reign will also enter into the new heaven.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:17.860]   So there is no distinction like some go to new heaven, some go to new earth, and that's the final state.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:19.860]   That's not the final state.
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.860]   The millennium is not the final state.
[00:28:23.860 --> 00:28:26.860]   A thousand year reign of Christ.
[00:28:26.860 --> 00:28:30.860]   [Audience] So when the Bible says after death comes judgment,
[00:28:30.860 --> 00:28:33.860]   like if I die tonight, just here is where we'll be?
[00:28:33.860 --> 00:28:36.860]   Just floating somewhere?
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:38.860]   Is this offline?
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:42.860]   Yeah, I mean, let me say this, and then we'll move on.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:45.860]   I don't want to just get stuck here. Okay?
[00:28:45.860 --> 00:28:51.860]   We take the Bible literally, so when the Bible says to be absent in the body is to be present with Christ,
[00:28:51.860 --> 00:28:53.860]   and we know that that's exactly what's going to happen.
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:59.860]   But at the same time, when we die, the concept of, like, am I here or over there?
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:00.860]   Right?
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   That's people who are limited, finite, in their physical body.
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:06.860]   Right?
[00:29:06.860 --> 00:29:07.860]   God is eternal.
[00:29:07.860 --> 00:29:10.860]   So is he here today or tomorrow or yesterday?
[00:29:10.860 --> 00:29:12.860]   The answer is yes.
[00:29:12.860 --> 00:29:13.860]   Right?
[00:29:13.860 --> 00:29:17.860]   So we're thinking, like, if I die, will I be with him then?
[00:29:17.860 --> 00:29:21.860]   When Jesus is same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.860]   He's outside of time.
[00:29:23.860 --> 00:29:30.860]   So we're trying to apply how you and I understand life in the context of the life that we're going to have eternity with him.
[00:29:30.860 --> 00:29:32.860]   In past, present, and future.
[00:29:32.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   So it's not, anything that we say about what the eternal life is going to look like, it's going to be a philosophical question.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:39.860]   Right?
[00:29:39.860 --> 00:29:41.860]   Theologically, we say yes, that's what's going to happen.
[00:29:41.860 --> 00:29:44.860]   Well, how does, what does that look like?
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:47.860]   Then we start thinking about, philosophically, how do we understand that?
[00:29:47.860 --> 00:29:48.860]   Right?
[00:29:48.860 --> 00:29:51.860]   We can leave it at that.
[00:29:51.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   Alright, so let me move on.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:55.860]   We can talk more about it in person, okay?
[00:29:55.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   Mmm.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.860]   [Laughter]
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:10.860]   It's punishing us for not moving.
[00:30:10.860 --> 00:30:11.860]   Alright?
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:14.860]   [Laughter]
[00:30:14.860 --> 00:30:15.860]   Is it this?
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:20.860]   [Laughter]
[00:30:20.860 --> 00:30:21.860]   No, it's because he did it.
[00:30:21.860 --> 00:30:23.860]   [Laughter]
[00:30:23.860 --> 00:30:25.860]   You know, I think the battery for this is dead.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:26.860]   Sorry.
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:29.860]   No, he did it.
[00:30:29.860 --> 00:30:33.860]   Okay, well, you guys can fill that in, or we can change the battery for this.
[00:30:33.860 --> 00:30:36.860]   It's the AAA.
[00:30:36.860 --> 00:30:37.860]   Thanks, Brian.
[00:30:37.860 --> 00:30:47.860]   Alright, thank you.
[00:30:47.860 --> 00:30:49.860]   No, just two, thank you.
[00:30:49.860 --> 00:31:01.860]   Tell me which is positive, I can't see it.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:05.860]   That's the top.
[00:31:05.860 --> 00:31:20.860]   Okay.
[00:31:20.860 --> 00:31:26.860]   Alright, so in the new heaven and new earth, he said the Lord will know what they will need and answer even before they call.
[00:31:26.860 --> 00:31:27.860]   Right?
[00:31:27.860 --> 00:31:33.860]   And again, part of the reason why there is frustration, even in our daily prayer of life, is, again, part of it is,
[00:31:33.860 --> 00:31:36.860]   we're not intimately with the Lord.
[00:31:36.860 --> 00:31:37.860]   Right?
[00:31:37.860 --> 00:31:38.860]   We're here, not yet.
[00:31:38.860 --> 00:31:43.860]   So just like we have this physical body that we have to wrestle through, and one day we're going to be delivered,
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:48.860]   and we're going to be seeing him face to face, and so when that happens, even in our prayers,
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:52.860]   we say he's going to know us so intimately, we're going to know him so intimately, he won't answer.
[00:31:52.860 --> 00:31:53.860]   Right?
[00:31:53.860 --> 00:31:59.860]   So, it's interesting that part of living in a fallen world is that even our prayer life,
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:05.860]   even our intimacy with him isn't going to be exactly what it ought to be in eternity.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:15.860]   And ultimately, there's going to be peace.
[00:32:15.860 --> 00:32:21.860]   If you look at verse 1, chapter 66, verse 1, it says,
[00:32:21.860 --> 00:32:25.860]   "Thus says the Lord, 'Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool.
[00:32:25.860 --> 00:32:29.860]   What is the house that you would build for me, and what is the place of my rest?'"
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:39.860]   So, in context of verse 1 and 2, what is he saying?
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:47.860]   I mean, God has the throne, his throne on earth, and the earth is his footstool.
[00:32:47.860 --> 00:32:52.860]   What can you possibly add that he doesn't already have?
[00:32:52.860 --> 00:32:53.860]   Right?
[00:32:53.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   So, basically, what he's telling the nation of Israel is,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:00.860]   "You're working hard to do all of these things, but at the end of the day, he owns everything.
[00:33:00.860 --> 00:33:02.860]   The earth itself is his footstool."
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:09.860]   So, how can you possibly think that what God needs is your effort, is your strength, your money?
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:10.860]   Right?
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   What God wants is not looking for talent, he's not looking for ability.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:16.860]   Right?
[00:33:16.860 --> 00:33:20.860]   He says he's looking for a humble and contrite heart, broken people,
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:26.860]   a vessel that he could wield and use for his purpose.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:34.860]   So, the best thing that we can offer up to him is a life that's easily moldable, obedient.
[00:33:34.860 --> 00:33:37.860]   When he says, "Left, go left." When he says, "Right, go right."
[00:33:37.860 --> 00:33:38.860]   Right?
[00:33:38.860 --> 00:33:42.860]   Humble and submitted, so that if he's a potter and we're the clay,
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   the best thing we can offer up to him is a clay that's easily moldable.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:47.860]   Right?
[00:33:47.860 --> 00:33:50.860]   You come to him like, "Well, you know, I'm going to be useful for this."
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:54.860]   And he says, "Well, how can you possibly add the earth is my footstool?"
[00:33:54.860 --> 00:33:57.860]   And that was the problem with the nation of Israel.
[00:33:57.860 --> 00:34:02.860]   In their pride, they were coming before Yahweh and saying, "We're doing all of this for you."
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:03.860]   Right?
[00:34:03.860 --> 00:34:06.860]   "Why aren't you answering our prayers? Why aren't you doing this? Why aren't you doing that?"
[00:34:06.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   He said, "But in reality, what God is looking for is a broken and contrite heart."
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:16.860]   How does God look at sacrifices?
[00:34:16.860 --> 00:34:23.860]   Those who give false sacrifices and worship are no different than any other murderer or idol worshippers.
[00:34:23.860 --> 00:34:28.860]   Verse 3, "He who slaughters an ox is like one who kills a man.
[00:34:28.860 --> 00:34:31.860]   He who sacrifices a lamb, like one who breaks a dog's neck.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.860]   He who presents a grain offering, like one who offers pig's blood."
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:43.860]   All of these things are, again, in some form, an act of worship, and yet God says, "That's not worship.
[00:34:43.860 --> 00:34:50.860]   You're just killing animals. You're like a murderer."
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:57.860]   He says that there's going to be such delusion in false worship that those who persecute the righteous will do it claiming that they are glorifying God.
[00:34:57.860 --> 00:35:01.860]   Verse 5, "Hear the word of the Lord, you who tremble at His word.
[00:35:01.860 --> 00:35:08.860]   Your brothers who hate you and cast you out for My name's sake have said, 'Let the Lord be glorified that we may see your joy,
[00:35:08.860 --> 00:35:16.860]   but it is they who shall be put to shame.'" What does that sound like?
[00:35:16.860 --> 00:35:22.860]   The Jewish leaders, right, who crucified Christ, thinking that they're doing God a favor.
[00:35:22.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   So think about just how hardened and just how fallen that they were, that they're crucifying the Son of God, and they're all doing it in the name of Yahweh.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   And that's exactly what God says, that they're going to be so delusional in where they stand before God,
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:45.860]   and yet they created this hierarchy of who's right with God and who's not, and who's righteous and who's not.
[00:35:45.860 --> 00:35:52.860]   And when the true Messiah comes, they're completely off. They weren't just simply out of order.
[00:35:52.860 --> 00:35:58.860]   They didn't just get, you know, you had the Sanhedrin and the Pharisees, and say, "You know what?
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:02.860]   You have a few people who are not in the right place." Right?
[00:36:02.860 --> 00:36:07.860]   He didn't just come and just kind of reorganize. He came and looked at the whole system, and He said,
[00:36:07.860 --> 00:36:13.860]   "Everybody on this row, everybody who's pursuing this, you guys are all wrong.
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.860]   They were the ones blaspheming His name." Right?
[00:36:16.860 --> 00:36:23.860]   Everybody that they looked up to, the teachers, the scribes, the Pharisees, the leaders of Israel,
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:28.860]   they were the ones who were blaspheming the name of God. So they weren't just a little bit off.
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   They completely, from beginning to the end.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:39.860]   And then they crucify the Messiah that they've been preaching and teaching for hundreds of years,
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.860]   and they all did it saying that they're glorifying God.
[00:36:42.860 --> 00:36:50.860]   That's how delusional they were. Again, that's why I think false worship is so dangerous.
[00:36:50.860 --> 00:36:55.860]   That's why sometimes I think the people who are the most delusional
[00:36:55.860 --> 00:37:01.860]   are religious people who don't have a personal relationship with Christ.
[00:37:01.860 --> 00:37:05.860]   People who are in the church, who've heard the gospel, who go through the motion,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:10.860]   and do all of that stuff, and they don't have a personal relationship with Christ.
[00:37:10.860 --> 00:37:16.860]   Because we kind of feel like we're on the boat that's safe.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:19.860]   At least the non-Christians know. They don't believe, and they know where they stand,
[00:37:19.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   whether they believe or don't believe. But the people who are, I think the biggest tragedy
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   will be in the church, who think that they're going to be meeting their Savior,
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:32.860]   and realize at the end that they're going to be in the wrong line.
[00:37:32.860 --> 00:37:40.860]   They're in the judgment line. Right? And that's what He's warning the nation of Israel.
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:44.860]   What are they referring to?
[00:37:44.860 --> 00:37:48.860]   He goes into this elaborate description in verse 7,
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   "Before she was in labor, she gave birth. Before her pain came upon her,
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:55.860]   she delivered a son. Who has heard such a thing? Who has seen such a thing?"
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:38:00.860]   In other words, that this lady was pregnant, and all of a sudden, she's going to give birth.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:04.860]   Verse 9, "Shall I bring to the point of birth, and not cause to bring forth?"
[00:38:04.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   In other words, God has been working through history,
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:11.860]   and He didn't set all of this up to just at the end, just kind of forget it,
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:15.860]   and sweep it under the rug. Whether it was for the salvation of Israel,
[00:38:15.860 --> 00:38:19.860]   salvation of His people, or for their judgment.
[00:38:19.860 --> 00:38:24.860]   God has been carefully orchestrating all of this to fulfill His purpose.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:29.860]   He's not going to bring it up to that point, and then just say, "Forget it." Right?
[00:38:29.860 --> 00:38:35.860]   So that's what He's referring to. He said, "Shall I impregnate the history of mankind,
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:37.860]   and at the end just kind of forget it?" In other words,
[00:38:37.860 --> 00:38:45.860]   everything that He has said, He's going to fulfill. Everything.
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:48.860]   How does He describe His second coming?
[00:38:48.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   "To those who justify themselves, those are the ones who will not be justified."
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:58.860]   Verse 17, "Those who sanctify and purify themselves to go into the gardens,
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:01.860]   following one in the midst, eating pigs' flesh and abomination,
[00:39:01.860 --> 00:39:05.860]   and mice shall come to an end together, declares the Lord."
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:08.860]   They will not be justified.
[00:39:08.860 --> 00:39:11.860]   Those who stand before God and feeling like they don't need to be justified,
[00:39:11.860 --> 00:39:14.860]   they are the ones who are going to be guilty.
[00:39:14.860 --> 00:39:16.860]   So what does this mean?
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:23.860]   The only way to be justified before God is to recognize our sin and repent.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   To receive the forgiveness of God.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:32.860]   And obviously all of this is in preparation for the coming Messiah.
[00:39:32.860 --> 00:39:35.860]   So imagine if you're reading this and saying, "Those who justify themselves,
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.860]   the judgment is coming." Then how do we get justified?
[00:39:39.860 --> 00:39:43.860]   That's the big question that they should have had.
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.860]   If all this religious worship and all of these things,
[00:39:46.860 --> 00:39:50.860]   if this doesn't justify us, then what's going to justify us?
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:53.860]   Almost like a mystery. And that's what Paul says, right?
[00:39:53.860 --> 00:39:56.860]   The mystery of the Gospel was revealed in Christ.
[00:39:56.860 --> 00:39:59.860]   That He kind of took us to that point and kind of like,
[00:39:59.860 --> 00:40:02.860]   "Well, He's coming. Well, what is He going to do?"
[00:40:02.860 --> 00:40:06.860]   He's going to justify our sins.
[00:40:06.860 --> 00:40:10.860]   "And all the nations will gather together and see His glory."
[00:40:10.860 --> 00:40:13.860]   In other words, His promises that He's making to the Kingdom of Israel
[00:40:13.860 --> 00:40:16.860]   is going to be opened up to the rest of the world.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:20.860]   And it's the Gentiles that will be the ones declaring His glory.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:26.860]   And then eventually God's going to use them to bring Israel back.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   We've been studying through the book of Romans.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:31.860]   We're almost there. We're not quite there yet.
[00:40:31.860 --> 00:40:34.860]   But when we get to chapter 9, this is exactly what He's going to fulfill.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:39.860]   Romans chapter 9, 10, and 11 is the fulfillment of this particular passage.
[00:40:39.860 --> 00:40:43.860]   There's going to be a hardening of the heart of Israel momentarily.
[00:40:43.860 --> 00:40:48.860]   And then we're living right now in the period of the Gentiles, the Church Age.
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.860]   But when that period is full, He said that Israel is going to be regrafted in.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:56.860]   So this is what that is in reference to.
[00:40:56.860 --> 00:41:00.860]   So right now, it's not the Jews. It's not the literal people of God or the nation of Israel.
[00:41:00.860 --> 00:41:03.860]   But the Gentiles are the ones building the churches.
[00:41:03.860 --> 00:41:08.860]   But eventually, through the Gentiles, revival is going to break out in the nation of Israel.
[00:41:08.860 --> 00:41:10.860]   And they're going to be brought back. So that's what that passage is.
[00:41:10.860 --> 00:41:18.860]   And Romans chapter 9, 10, and 11 describes this in detail.
[00:41:18.860 --> 00:41:23.860]   And what is the ultimate purpose of this restoration?
[00:41:23.860 --> 00:41:31.860]   They're all going to come and worship Him. That's the end product.
[00:41:31.860 --> 00:41:35.860]   Worship. Worship is the final purpose.
[00:41:35.860 --> 00:41:39.860]   All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:41:39.860 --> 00:41:42.860]   That's what has gone wrong.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:47.860]   Instead of giving glory to God, instead of seeking His glory, instead of worshipping His glory,
[00:41:47.860 --> 00:41:52.860]   even at our best, we're always wrestling with our glory and His glory.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:54.860]   Our will and His will.
[00:41:54.860 --> 00:41:58.860]   And that's, again, it's a description of the fall of mankind.
[00:41:58.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   At the end, when God restores, He's going to bring everybody back.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.860]   For what purpose? To come and worship.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.860]   He's going to reveal His glory that we've fallen short of.
[00:42:07.860 --> 00:42:13.860]   But when we are in the presence of His full glory, we're going to break up into worship.
[00:42:13.860 --> 00:42:18.860]   So, it's just, right now, we wrestle with smaller worship.
[00:42:18.860 --> 00:42:21.860]   You know, competing worship.
[00:42:21.860 --> 00:42:25.860]   Whether it's sports or whatever it is that we get wrapped up in.
[00:42:25.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   Again, none of this stuff is necessarily wrong.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:31.860]   But if we're not careful, it can compete with God's glory.
[00:42:31.860 --> 00:42:33.860]   It can compete with His worship.
[00:42:33.860 --> 00:42:39.860]   But He says, at the end, when His glory is fully revealed, there's going to be no competition.
[00:42:39.860 --> 00:42:42.860]   All the nations are going to come.
[00:42:42.860 --> 00:42:46.860]   What we're going to be doing in eternity is to give Him worship.
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:53.860]   So, if you don't know the ecstasy of really, truly worshipping God,
[00:42:53.860 --> 00:42:59.860]   and your idea of worship is singing hymns, clapping, you know what I mean?
[00:42:59.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   It's just boring.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:04.860]   There's nothing to look forward to in eternity.
[00:43:04.860 --> 00:43:08.860]   But I think every Christian knows.
[00:43:08.860 --> 00:43:09.860]   Every genuine Christian knows.
[00:43:09.860 --> 00:43:14.860]   Because what a Christian is, is somebody who's seen the glory of Christ.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:15.860]   Right?
[00:43:15.860 --> 00:43:16.860]   That's what a Christian is.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.860]   And that's why you repent, and that's why you come to church.
[00:43:19.860 --> 00:43:20.860]   Hopefully.
[00:43:20.860 --> 00:43:21.860]   Right?
[00:43:21.860 --> 00:43:25.860]   So, a genuine believer is one who has seen the glory of Christ,
[00:43:25.860 --> 00:43:28.860]   and now desires that for the rest of eternity.
[00:43:28.860 --> 00:43:32.860]   So, a non-Christian, I don't care what he says, I don't care how much he knows,
[00:43:32.860 --> 00:43:37.860]   if they haven't tasted the goodness of God, they have not seen His glory,
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:41.860]   none of these things are going to be attractive to you.
[00:43:41.860 --> 00:43:43.860]   None of these things.
[00:43:43.860 --> 00:43:48.860]   Promise of gathering of all the nations for the purpose of worshipping God,
[00:43:48.860 --> 00:43:51.860]   when worshipping God today is not attractive,
[00:43:51.860 --> 00:43:53.860]   why would this be attractive?
[00:43:53.860 --> 00:44:00.860]   Why would a greater revelation of His glory be attractive to a non-Christian?
[00:44:00.860 --> 00:44:03.860]   Heaven wouldn't be attractive to a non-Christian.
[00:44:03.860 --> 00:44:04.860]   Right?
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:10.860]   It would only be attractive to somebody who's tasted and seen a glimpse of His glory.
[00:44:10.860 --> 00:44:16.860]   I think for every Christian, again as we wrap up, for every Christian,
[00:44:16.860 --> 00:44:24.860]   the hungering and thirsting that we have inside of our hearts isn't for meaning.
[00:44:24.860 --> 00:44:25.860]   Right?
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:27.860]   Isn't for relationships.
[00:44:27.860 --> 00:44:29.860]   Isn't for safety and peace.
[00:44:29.860 --> 00:44:33.860]   In my opinion, it's not even love.
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:37.860]   I don't think that that's at the core of who we are, and that's what drives us.
[00:44:37.860 --> 00:44:43.860]   Because we were created for the purpose of glorifying Christ, glorifying God.
[00:44:43.860 --> 00:44:46.860]   That's at the core of our basic needs.
[00:44:46.860 --> 00:44:49.860]   Remember, we hear things, cliche things like,
[00:44:49.860 --> 00:44:53.860]   every human being has a God-shaped heart that only God can fill.
[00:44:53.860 --> 00:44:55.860]   And I believe that that is the case.
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.860]   But that God-shaped heart, God-shaped place,
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.860]   whatever it is that mankind has fallen short of,
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:06.860]   is a place that is reserved for His glory.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:08.860]   Right?
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:15.860]   So, again, to attract people to the church with anything else
[00:45:15.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   other than a greater revelation of His glory is a lie.
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.860]   Because that's not what God promises.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:27.860]   God doesn't promise a purpose and safety.
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:32.860]   In fact, sometimes God will cause you not to have safety
[00:45:32.860 --> 00:45:34.860]   for the purpose of weeding things out,
[00:45:34.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   so that you can have a greater glimpse of His glory.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:38.860]   Right?
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:43.860]   In fact, sometimes you will feel rejected and unloved,
[00:45:43.860 --> 00:45:47.860]   so that you can see that there's only one place and one person
[00:45:47.860 --> 00:45:50.860]   that will give you true meaning.
[00:45:50.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   So God didn't promise all of that.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:53.860]   God didn't promise friendship.
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:54.860]   God didn't promise safety.
[00:45:54.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   God didn't promise a good job.
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:57.860]   Right?
[00:45:57.860 --> 00:46:00.860]   So, whether it's us, whether it's us preaching the gospel,
[00:46:00.860 --> 00:46:01.860]   or whether it's the church as a whole,
[00:46:01.860 --> 00:46:03.860]   if we promise anything else,
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:08.860]   if we do anything else in the church other than a greater revelation of His glory,
[00:46:08.860 --> 00:46:13.860]   then the church is not representing what God represents in the scripture.
[00:46:13.860 --> 00:46:17.860]   I think a Christian who is going to persevere is a person
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:21.860]   who is fixated on the coming of Christ and His glory,
[00:46:21.860 --> 00:46:22.860]   and hungering and thirsting,
[00:46:22.860 --> 00:46:25.860]   that can only be satisfied when you meet Him.
[00:46:25.860 --> 00:46:26.860]   Right?
[00:46:26.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   When you meet Christ.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:29.860]   And if that's what's driving you,
[00:46:29.860 --> 00:46:31.860]   that's what's going to cause you to persevere.
[00:46:31.860 --> 00:46:32.860]   But if that's not what's driving you,
[00:46:32.860 --> 00:46:36.860]   at some point, your disappointment in church and people's circumstance
[00:46:36.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   is going to cause you to look for it somewhere else.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   But again, as we wrap up the book of Isaiah,
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:45.860]   we'll do a final study next week.
[00:46:45.860 --> 00:46:50.860]   At the end of the human history, this is what God promises.
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   Right?
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:53.860]   Look at the book of Revelation.
[00:46:53.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   The end times is all the nations gathering at His throne,
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:46:59.860]   worshiping, bowing down,
[00:46:59.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   "Holy, holy, holy is the Lord God Almighty."
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   That's what we're going to be doing for eternity.
[00:47:07.860 --> 00:47:08.860]   Right?
[00:47:08.860 --> 00:47:11.860]   And so that's why we have quiet time.
[00:47:11.860 --> 00:47:13.860]   That's why we encourage you to get into the Bible.
[00:47:13.860 --> 00:47:15.860]   It's not so that good Christians read the Bible.
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:19.860]   The Word of God contains revelation of His glory.
[00:47:19.860 --> 00:47:21.860]   So the more you get a glimpse of His glory,
[00:47:21.860 --> 00:47:24.860]   there's going to be a greater hungering and thirsting for that glory.
[00:47:24.860 --> 00:47:28.860]   And that's what causes you to seek Him out.
[00:47:28.860 --> 00:47:30.860]   Right?
[00:47:30.860 --> 00:47:34.860]   So quiet time is not about, like, "I did it" or "I didn't do it."
[00:47:34.860 --> 00:47:38.860]   Getting bits and pieces, getting a taste of who He is,
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:43.860]   every single day, that causes you to continue to seek Him out.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:51.860]   All right. So again, next week we're going to wrap up the study.
[00:47:51.860 --> 00:47:55.860]   You know, every song I sing, I just assume you guys know because it's been around for 30 years.
