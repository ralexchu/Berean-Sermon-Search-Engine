[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   All right, this morning we have a, our China team came back last week and they came back
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:14.180]   Saturday and Pastor Mark gave a sermon and he gave his update, but we asked if we can
[00:00:14.180 --> 00:00:18.440]   have a couple people from the China team to give us an update.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:21.440]   Well this morning everyone.
[00:00:21.440 --> 00:00:29.200]   Yeah, so my name is Jeremy and I was part of the missions team that went out to China
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:35.160]   and we just got back this past Saturday, so it's been about a week now since we got back,
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:42.240]   but God really used this trip to open my eyes and to teach me a lot of things.
[00:00:42.240 --> 00:00:45.520]   I just wanted to share a couple things that God taught me.
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:52.520]   So over the past two and a half weeks we had a lot of opportunities to be able to hang
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:54.000]   out with the students.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:56.680]   We had about a hundred students.
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:01:03.600]   There were about 90 women and 10 guys, so we got to know the guys pretty well and just
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:08.960]   throughout the camp during break times, during meals, and during dorm visits we got to talk
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:10.920]   to them a lot.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:21.080]   And I think as we interacted with the students, God broke my heart a little bit for the students.
[00:01:21.080 --> 00:01:27.440]   A lot of the people were living out their lives just like we do here.
[00:01:27.440 --> 00:01:34.200]   They're pursuing their goals and they just, you know, a lot of them have been through
[00:01:34.200 --> 00:01:35.200]   rough experiences.
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:42.440]   I talked to a lot of people that faced depression and even had thoughts about suicide and stuff
[00:01:42.440 --> 00:01:43.440]   like that.
[00:01:43.440 --> 00:01:51.160]   And I also met people that were a lot older, like in their 50s and stuff, but you know,
[00:01:51.160 --> 00:01:55.480]   you could tell that they kind of were looking for something more.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:59.640]   And so as I met these people, I felt like I really connected with them and I could relate
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.440]   a lot with them, at least personally.
[00:02:02.440 --> 00:02:07.720]   And God broke my heart for these people because they didn't have the gospel and they didn't
[00:02:07.720 --> 00:02:09.960]   know who Jesus was.
[00:02:09.960 --> 00:02:14.200]   And they were pursuing the world.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:22.400]   And at least personally, you know, like, you know, like it hurts me to see that because
[00:02:22.400 --> 00:02:24.640]   in the end, like none of those things really matter.
[00:02:24.640 --> 00:02:31.080]   So something that we questioned a lot with them was, you know, is that all there is to
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:36.160]   life, you know, just pursuing your job, getting a good education and stuff, studying hard
[00:02:36.160 --> 00:02:38.320]   for the students that are in there.
[00:02:38.320 --> 00:02:44.480]   And it made me open my eyes to see the need of the gospel there, which was, you know,
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:49.280]   something that is kind of hard to see sometimes back at home just because I'm so caught up
[00:02:49.280 --> 00:02:54.120]   in like what I'm doing here and stuff.
[00:02:54.120 --> 00:02:59.720]   Another thing that challenged me, we did actually a devotion from John 4, 37 to 38.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:03.800]   It says, "For here the saying holds true, one sows and another reaps.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:06.760]   I sent you to reap that for which you did not labor.
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:11.720]   Others have labored and you have entered into their labor."
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:15.800]   Going out for two and a half weeks, it was kind of, I didn't really know what to expect
[00:03:15.800 --> 00:03:21.840]   and I didn't know, I kind of had doubts on how effective we would be just being there
[00:03:21.840 --> 00:03:28.080]   for two weeks because in the past two weeks, we got close to the students, but, you know,
[00:03:28.080 --> 00:03:30.480]   it wasn't a lot of time with them.
[00:03:30.480 --> 00:03:36.200]   And so I think this passage really showed that although we were only there for a short
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:41.280]   time, that we were really able to make an impact on the students just by showing them
[00:03:41.280 --> 00:03:45.640]   love and just by, you know, talking to them.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:49.960]   Something that all the students told us was that, like, they all knew that we were Christian.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:54.800]   I think that one thing that they were constantly saying is like, "Wow, like you Christians
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:56.880]   are like genuinely loving people."
[00:03:56.880 --> 00:04:02.960]   And I think just that alone was able to make an impact on them and be able to like help
[00:04:02.960 --> 00:04:08.040]   them think about, you know, our message to them more.
[00:04:08.040 --> 00:04:13.000]   And so God taught me that he can use anyone and anything to make his gospel known.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.160]   We've been learning about it in Romans a lot that although we're weak vessels, God
[00:04:17.160 --> 00:04:24.920]   uses us not by our own strength, but just according to his perfect plan.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:31.000]   And so that kind of motivated me even coming back home that, you know, anything that we
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:36.200]   do, you know, can make a difference.
[00:04:36.200 --> 00:04:39.680]   Sometimes I don't try because I feel like, "Oh, what's the point?
[00:04:39.680 --> 00:04:41.520]   I'm not going to make a difference."
[00:04:41.520 --> 00:04:48.080]   But God taught me that even just by showing someone compassion and just really reaching
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.040]   out to someone can really make a big impact because you never know what someone's going
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.000]   through in their life.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.360]   And so those are two things that God taught me during this mission trip.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:05.620]   So I would say if you guys could pray for the students that we met.
[00:05:05.620 --> 00:05:11.680]   I think a lot of our team has made connections with the students there that they're still
[00:05:11.680 --> 00:05:13.200]   keeping in contact with right now.
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:20.360]   So just pray that God would use like messaging as an avenue to continue to reach out to the
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   students.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.560]   They're asking a lot of questions and they're really interested, but just pray that God
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:26.560]   would open their eyes.
[00:05:26.560 --> 00:05:27.560]   And yeah, that's it.
[00:05:27.560 --> 00:05:28.560]   Thank you.
[00:05:28.560 --> 00:05:29.560]   Hello, church.
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:40.560]   My name is Christine and I'm one of the 10 team members that went on the China trip.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:46.680]   First, we would like to thank the church for your support and your partnership on this
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:47.680]   trip.
[00:05:47.680 --> 00:05:52.320]   We are just working really mightily in China and we thank you all so much for covering
[00:05:52.320 --> 00:05:55.400]   us with your prayers before and during the trip.
[00:05:55.400 --> 00:05:59.560]   And please continue to keep China in your prayers.
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:04.360]   Our team was so blessed in China and I'm sure we all have so many stories to share.
[00:06:04.360 --> 00:06:08.340]   So please feel free to ask any of us about the trip.
[00:06:08.340 --> 00:06:14.960]   One of my favorite parts of the program was Pastor Alex's English corners that he added
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:21.040]   on as an optional session at the end of the day, despite having already had classes from
[00:06:21.040 --> 00:06:25.640]   8 a.m. to 7 p.m. for the students, a good handful of them still came out.
[00:06:25.640 --> 00:06:27.680]   So we were very thankful.
[00:06:27.680 --> 00:06:32.520]   A little background, Pastor Alex was a pastor here and he moved out to China a couple years
[00:06:32.520 --> 00:06:33.520]   ago.
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:38.680]   It was my first time meeting him in China and he's a really cool guy and I'm really
[00:06:38.680 --> 00:06:43.880]   thankful that I got to get to know him and be able to serve with him.
[00:06:43.880 --> 00:06:47.320]   So the English corners are presentations on random topics.
[00:06:47.320 --> 00:06:53.480]   So our topics were culture shock, baseball, dating and marriage, conflict resolution,
[00:06:53.480 --> 00:06:54.640]   things like that.
[00:06:54.640 --> 00:06:58.760]   And then there's a discussion at the end and for the students it's a good way to practice
[00:06:58.760 --> 00:06:59.760]   English.
[00:06:59.760 --> 00:07:05.620]   And for us it was used as an opportunity to share the gospel with them.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:09.560]   So during these times God made a few things really clear to me.
[00:07:09.560 --> 00:07:15.640]   One thing was that God is going to move and work regardless of my efforts or sometimes
[00:07:15.640 --> 00:07:18.600]   the lack thereof of my efforts.
[00:07:18.600 --> 00:07:22.280]   By the end of the day we were all really exhausted and there were times when I just wanted to
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:24.640]   zone out or just sit there.
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:29.600]   Yeah, there was one night towards the end where Joyce and I had to sit through eight,
[00:07:29.600 --> 00:07:33.240]   nine hours of speeches, which was really long.
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   But yeah, even when I wanted to just sit and not really have a conversation about God,
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:39.480]   the Holy Spirit still moves.
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:44.560]   And those nights they asked so many more questions that we didn't even instigate.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.760]   Like Jeremy shared, a lot of them, all of them knew that we were Christians and they
[00:07:47.760 --> 00:07:52.280]   were really amazed that we would just come and pay for our trip to China to help them.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:57.920]   So it was a really good way to really start talking about the gospel.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.480]   And second, God's work in my life is undeniable and unavoidable.
[00:08:03.480 --> 00:08:08.400]   So in the same way, whenever we were sharing, even if I didn't want to talk about God, He
[00:08:08.400 --> 00:08:13.800]   just came out anyways because I realized that all of my life decisions and my actions were
[00:08:13.800 --> 00:08:15.640]   based on my faith.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.160]   And therefore I couldn't share anything about myself or my thoughts on any topic without
[00:08:20.160 --> 00:08:26.520]   just going back to the gospel and without sharing my faith with them.
[00:08:26.520 --> 00:08:30.120]   And last, God uses me as a vessel.
[00:08:30.120 --> 00:08:34.920]   He's the one who worked in me and therefore He will work in the students' hearts.
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:40.040]   I was personally able to find a way to sneak in the gospel like once every day during those
[00:08:40.040 --> 00:08:41.040]   English Corners.
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:45.600]   So if you multiply that by 10 and then every night, we were able to share a lot and there's
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:49.360]   a lot of good conversations that came about.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:54.120]   And Joyce and I personally had really good opportunities sharing with some of the sisters.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:08:59.240]   And one of the students named Felix and we were able to share a lot with her and she
[00:08:59.240 --> 00:09:00.720]   had a lot of really good questions.
[00:09:00.720 --> 00:09:04.800]   So she was one of the students that we gave a Bible to at the end and thankfully she goes
[00:09:04.800 --> 00:09:07.320]   to school really close to Pastor Alex.
[00:09:07.320 --> 00:09:10.200]   So she's interested in going to his Bible studies and things like that.
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.520]   So that's something we're really thankful for and we hope and pray that she'll continue
[00:09:14.520 --> 00:09:17.120]   to be there if we ever go back.
[00:09:17.120 --> 00:09:23.560]   Yeah, but with that said, a lot of us were also really sad that we couldn't connect the
[00:09:23.560 --> 00:09:28.920]   students with any community or church or friends back where they were at because they came
[00:09:28.920 --> 00:09:32.160]   from all over China, not just Beijing.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:37.600]   So yeah, it was easy to feel hopeless or wonder if they would ever even think about the conversations
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:38.600]   we had.
[00:09:38.600 --> 00:09:42.040]   There was like nights where Joyce and I would stay there until 11 o'clock just sharing about
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.640]   who God is and like answering their questions.
[00:09:45.640 --> 00:09:49.840]   But as I've been reflecting on the trip and myself, I realized that that same principle
[00:09:49.840 --> 00:09:55.440]   could technically be applied to me or any of us here that, you know, God didn't have
[00:09:55.440 --> 00:09:57.240]   to work in our heart, but he did.
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:00.360]   And in the same way he's going to work in their heart, whether or not they have that
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   community or not, God's going to work in his own way.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:06.360]   So I think that gave me a lot of hope and assurance in that.
[00:10:06.360 --> 00:10:11.160]   Yeah, and I just wanted to end with a couple of prayer requests.
[00:10:11.160 --> 00:10:15.880]   First of all, a big thing, I think, like I just said, there's a lot of people who want
[00:10:15.880 --> 00:10:19.360]   to know about the gospel, but there's not enough people sharing.
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:24.040]   So yeah, China really needs more workers and more people to share and serve and, you know,
[00:10:24.040 --> 00:10:28.280]   spread the gospel in China and all throughout.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:33.360]   Also a lot of the Christians that we encountered out of the students, they struggled a lot
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:39.360]   with kind of just thinking of God as someone who helps them in times of need and kind of
[00:10:39.360 --> 00:10:40.960]   that's about it.
[00:10:40.960 --> 00:10:45.240]   So as we asked them more questions, it got them thinking, but they definitely, again,
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:52.000]   need more just people to guide them and help them live out their Christian lives.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:11:00.080]   For Pastor Alex, continual endurance, family's physical and spiritual strength, and again,
[00:11:00.080 --> 00:11:05.080]   more workers because, yeah, just praying that Pastor Alex will have genuine brothers and
[00:11:05.080 --> 00:11:10.160]   sisters that he could serve and just be encouraged by and encouraged.
[00:11:10.160 --> 00:11:16.800]   I think, yeah, it's hard when you're out there alone, even though he does have his family.
[00:11:16.800 --> 00:11:19.600]   Yeah, so keeping that in your prayers.
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:24.320]   And finally, those that we reached out to and those that Pastor Alex is still reaching
[00:11:24.320 --> 00:11:28.560]   out to that God will soften their hearts and they'll be able to let go of the things that
[00:11:28.560 --> 00:11:32.840]   they've been holding on to and really give their lives to Christ.
[00:11:32.840 --> 00:11:33.840]   Thank you.
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:34.840]   All right.
[00:11:34.840 --> 00:11:39.480]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 11, I'm going to be reading from verse
[00:11:39.480 --> 00:11:42.280]   seven through 10.
[00:11:42.280 --> 00:11:49.000]   And as Christine shared, if you guys can continue to keep our missionaries out in China
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   in prayer and also for our brothers and sisters, our pastors in India, I kind of updated you
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:03.200]   that they found a land that they're going to be building the training center in, but
[00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:06.520]   I got an email from them that the government is making it difficult for them to pull out
[00:12:06.520 --> 00:12:07.520]   money.
[00:12:07.520 --> 00:12:10.720]   So they would only let them pull out a certain small amount each time.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.280]   So if you've been following what's going on in India, the persecution is like exponentially
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:17.200]   growing in India.
[00:12:17.200 --> 00:12:19.640]   So if you've been following, so please continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:12:19.640 --> 00:12:22.720]   So every little thing that they're doing, they're making it difficult for them.
[00:12:22.720 --> 00:12:26.920]   So again, continue to keep them in your prayers.
[00:12:26.920 --> 00:12:31.520]   Romans chapter 11 verses seven through 10.
[00:12:31.520 --> 00:12:32.720]   What then?
[00:12:32.720 --> 00:12:35.980]   Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking.
[00:12:35.980 --> 00:12:39.360]   The elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened.
[00:12:39.360 --> 00:12:43.480]   As it is written, God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that
[00:12:43.480 --> 00:12:46.200]   would not hear down to this very day.
[00:12:46.200 --> 00:12:51.240]   And David says, let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:52.240]   for them.
[00:12:52.240 --> 00:12:56.280]   Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see and bend their backs forever.
[00:12:56.280 --> 00:12:57.960]   Let's pray.
[00:12:57.960 --> 00:13:05.720]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you for our China team coming back safely last week.
[00:13:05.720 --> 00:13:10.420]   And I pray that all the things that you have shown them and allow them to see and be convicted
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:15.720]   by that it would last Lord God more than just a few days or weeks.
[00:13:15.720 --> 00:13:20.400]   And I pray that it would be applied even at home, that they would see the harvest Lord,
[00:13:20.400 --> 00:13:22.800]   not just far away, but here.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:27.400]   And that even for our church, help us to see Lord that we are in the mission ground, that
[00:13:27.400 --> 00:13:32.480]   we would live our lives appropriately knowing father that we are a mist that comes and disappears,
[00:13:32.480 --> 00:13:36.200]   that everything that we do would be an investment for eternity.
[00:13:36.200 --> 00:13:41.260]   We pray father God that your word would speak to us that as Paul has intended his message
[00:13:41.260 --> 00:13:46.280]   Lord to convict, to strengthen, to build, to remind, I pray that it would have the same
[00:13:46.280 --> 00:13:49.480]   effect on your church in Jesus name we pray.
[00:13:49.480 --> 00:13:51.020]   Amen.
[00:13:51.020 --> 00:13:54.100]   So again, if you've been following, and I think most of you guys, as we've been following
[00:13:54.100 --> 00:13:58.960]   through the book of Romans, Paul has been sharing about the justification by faith.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:02.160]   And that's kind of like the central theme of the book of Romans.
[00:14:02.160 --> 00:14:06.320]   And we've landed on chapter nine through 11, where Paul says, what does it mean for the
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.320]   Jews then?
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:12.840]   And then specifically in chapter 10, he says that the reason why the Jews missed their
[00:14:12.840 --> 00:14:16.320]   Messiah is not because of lack of work.
[00:14:16.320 --> 00:14:20.960]   They weren't rebuked for lack of prayer because they were prayer warriors.
[00:14:20.960 --> 00:14:22.680]   They weren't rebuked for studying enough.
[00:14:22.680 --> 00:14:25.000]   They weren't rebuked for not giving enough.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.280]   And they were known to be great proselytizers.
[00:14:28.280 --> 00:14:32.680]   They went and went far places to share their message.
[00:14:32.680 --> 00:14:35.320]   And yet they completely missed God.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.780]   It says they had zeal, but yet they didn't have knowledge.
[00:14:40.780 --> 00:14:44.660]   So as a result of that, they were ignorant about the righteousness of God.
[00:14:44.660 --> 00:14:48.320]   They didn't recognize their own sin and they didn't recognize the righteousness of God.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:53.000]   And that's why they ultimately rejected Christ as the end of the law.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:58.040]   The passage that we looked at in chapter 11, verses one through six, despite all of that,
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:14:59.040]   Paul asks a question.
[00:14:59.040 --> 00:15:02.040]   I asked then, has God rejected his people?
[00:15:02.040 --> 00:15:06.680]   Considering all the rebellion, many, many years of rebellion against God and being blind,
[00:15:06.680 --> 00:15:09.440]   then is God done with the nation of Israel?
[00:15:09.440 --> 00:15:13.480]   And his answer was unequivocally, by no means.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:17.920]   God has not rejected his people because he foreknew them.
[00:15:17.920 --> 00:15:21.600]   Before they were even formed, he said God ordained to work through them, to made a covenant
[00:15:21.600 --> 00:15:22.600]   with them.
[00:15:22.600 --> 00:15:27.480]   And despite all of their rejection, he says he's going to work through the remnant, a
[00:15:27.480 --> 00:15:29.920]   small group of people that he's going to keep.
[00:15:29.920 --> 00:15:33.440]   And at the end times, he's going to restore to have genuine faith.
[00:15:33.440 --> 00:15:38.000]   And through them, he's going to fulfill his promise that despite all of that.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:45.200]   The obvious question, the practical question we ask is, how could a nation who is so privileged
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:53.520]   have been given so much, have become so blind by the time of Christ, that even as he appeared
[00:15:53.520 --> 00:15:57.320]   to them physically, not only physically, but he performed miracles.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.920]   They were constantly asking for proof and Jesus constantly gave them proof.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:08.440]   He opened eyes that were blind all their life that people could not deny.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.660]   He walks on water.
[00:16:09.660 --> 00:16:11.440]   He calms the storms.
[00:16:11.440 --> 00:16:15.320]   In fact, at the end, he even raises the dead.
[00:16:15.320 --> 00:16:19.240]   And the nation of Israel, maybe they didn't see all of it, but they've seen enough of
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:20.840]   his miracles.
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:22.640]   And he didn't mix words.
[00:16:22.640 --> 00:16:24.240]   There was no confusion.
[00:16:24.240 --> 00:16:30.640]   When Jesus rode on that donkey to come into Jerusalem, he was saying with an exclamation
[00:16:30.640 --> 00:16:36.000]   mark, if there was any doubt who he was, this should prove it.
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:40.840]   And yet when he was going to the cross, as a whole, the nation of Israel were completely
[00:16:40.840 --> 00:16:42.480]   blind.
[00:16:42.480 --> 00:16:45.280]   How can they have completely missed him in that way?
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:51.820]   In verse seven, he says, what then Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking.
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.040]   And they didn't seek casually.
[00:16:55.040 --> 00:16:59.760]   It wasn't that they missed him because they didn't put enough effort.
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:02.960]   The word for seeking in Greek is epizateo.
[00:17:02.960 --> 00:17:06.800]   And I mentioned this before, whenever you see a Greek word with the word epi in front
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.680]   of it, it's for the purpose of intensifying something.
[00:17:09.680 --> 00:17:11.940]   So zateo means to seek.
[00:17:11.940 --> 00:17:17.960]   So when he says it wasn't the lack of seeking, it was epizateo.
[00:17:17.960 --> 00:17:23.500]   They fervently, passionately sought it, and yet they did not obtain it.
[00:17:23.500 --> 00:17:27.320]   They sought it intensely, but they didn't get it.
[00:17:27.320 --> 00:17:32.280]   You know, when I was a young pastor, younger pastor, okay, I'm not going to say I'm old
[00:17:32.280 --> 00:17:38.160]   yet, okay, when I was a younger pastor, you know, I grew up in the church, so I know that
[00:17:38.160 --> 00:17:41.440]   especially the Korean community, they're known for prayer.
[00:17:41.440 --> 00:17:46.600]   You know, they get together sometimes five, 5.30 in the morning, and some of them spend
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.360]   an hour, sometimes even two hours, praying every single morning.
[00:17:50.360 --> 00:17:53.680]   So I grew up knowing that that's just kind of normal.
[00:17:53.680 --> 00:17:58.080]   When I first became a youth pastor, I was a part of a church where they met Monday through
[00:17:58.080 --> 00:18:03.360]   Friday, and I think they took a break on Sunday only, and then Monday through Saturday, every
[00:18:03.360 --> 00:18:04.800]   morning.
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:07.520]   And because I was a staff at the church, I was required to come.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:12.080]   So every morning at 5 o'clock to about 6.30, we would have prayer meeting, and then the
[00:18:12.080 --> 00:18:16.400]   pastor would give a short devotion, and then we would break, and everybody would go to
[00:18:16.400 --> 00:18:17.400]   work.
[00:18:17.400 --> 00:18:22.480]   Well, some of them, you know, I saw every single day at the church, and then some of
[00:18:22.480 --> 00:18:25.840]   them, whenever they had a break during the day, would come to church, and they would
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:29.000]   pray sometimes an hour, 30 minutes.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.600]   And so they were prayer warriors.
[00:18:31.600 --> 00:18:35.560]   And obviously, that was very challenging to me, and even though it was part of, you know,
[00:18:35.560 --> 00:18:41.200]   what was required of me, I really enjoyed it, to come in and spending time in prayer
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.200]   with a group of people, and it wasn't a small group.
[00:18:43.200 --> 00:18:46.760]   I think the church, when I first came in, had maybe about 300 people, and then the prayer
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:54.120]   meetings, you know, maybe had about 50 to 60 people on a regular basis, and sometimes
[00:18:54.120 --> 00:18:56.200]   when they had a lot, maybe about 100.
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:59.320]   And so it was a lot of people gathering together in prayer.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:05.680]   And then I found out that a lot of people, to build that church, they basically offered
[00:19:05.680 --> 00:19:08.120]   up their wedding ring, you know.
[00:19:08.120 --> 00:19:11.840]   And majority of the people were blue-collar workers, so they weren't millionaires.
[00:19:11.840 --> 00:19:17.480]   They were blue-collar workers, and they weren't rich, but they donated their wedding rings,
[00:19:17.480 --> 00:19:21.320]   and there was this movement in the Korean church community where they were kind of saying,
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:23.800]   like, symbolically, they're marrying Christ.
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:29.120]   And so when I heard about that, it was challenging, that people would give up something so valuable,
[00:19:29.120 --> 00:19:31.680]   and they would donate it to the church so that church could be built.
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:34.920]   And then, obviously, when I found out about that, I was very encouraged and challenged
[00:19:34.920 --> 00:19:36.920]   by it.
[00:19:36.920 --> 00:19:43.200]   But at the same time, in this same church, I've seen some of these same people get into
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.360]   arguments and get into fights.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:49.600]   And at one point, it got so bad where the police had to be called and break up these
[00:19:49.600 --> 00:19:51.640]   fights, and it was nothing new to me.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:53.480]   You know, I grew up in the church.
[00:19:53.480 --> 00:19:57.960]   My dad was a pastor, so I've seen a lot of crazy things inside the church.
[00:19:57.960 --> 00:20:03.480]   But what was confusing to me is it wasn't necessarily ungodly people.
[00:20:03.480 --> 00:20:06.760]   It was people who were praying in the mornings, who were sacrificing and giving and serving
[00:20:06.760 --> 00:20:08.480]   the church.
[00:20:08.480 --> 00:20:12.840]   They were the ones up in arms fighting and willing to swing at each other.
[00:20:12.840 --> 00:20:17.640]   Again, I would like to say that that was my one unique experience in the church, but that
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   wasn't the case.
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:20.320]   I've seen so much of that in the church.
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   Oftentimes, the ones who get into that kind of stuff are not the peripheral people because
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:26.480]   they don't care.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:30.360]   It's the people who are committed in the church, the ones that were leading small groups, the
[00:20:30.360 --> 00:20:36.560]   ones who are at the core, who are serving, and something went wrong.
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:41.680]   How could people who are at least seemingly on the surface that seem so close to God,
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:45.200]   and yet when things went wrong, it became so ugly?
[00:20:45.200 --> 00:20:51.840]   I mean, since then, I've realized that this is not unique to our generation or even the
[00:20:51.840 --> 00:20:55.160]   Korean community.
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:58.800]   The Jews were guilty of the same thing.
[00:20:58.800 --> 00:21:01.520]   They were very passionate, zealous, seeking.
[00:21:01.520 --> 00:21:05.480]   They were praying, doing Bible study, even proselytizing.
[00:21:05.480 --> 00:21:12.280]   They were doing all of this stuff, and it says, "Yet you had zeal without knowledge."
[00:21:12.280 --> 00:21:14.160]   There was commitment.
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:15.160]   There was dedication.
[00:21:15.160 --> 00:21:21.840]   There was sacrifice without knowing who Christ was.
[00:21:21.840 --> 00:21:26.080]   That's a tragedy of the nation of Israel, and that's a tragedy of many who are in the
[00:21:26.080 --> 00:21:32.440]   church where Jesus himself warned that when that day comes, "Many who says to me, 'Lord,
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:36.840]   Lord,' shall not enter the kingdom, say, 'You had nothing to do with me.'"
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:43.120]   That's a tragedy of a post-Christian culture where we are raised with the gospel taught
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:51.840]   in Bible study, doing exposition, and yet never coming to know Christ personally.
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:57.440]   It's all a theory, but we're never convicted.
[00:21:57.440 --> 00:22:03.520]   Paul gives a description of how the nation of Israel became so blind that even as their
[00:22:03.520 --> 00:22:09.400]   Messiah stood before them physically, and even as the Messiah was performing these miracles,
[00:22:09.400 --> 00:22:11.600]   they still missed him.
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:14.640]   There's four things that he mentions here in verses 9 through 10.
[00:22:14.640 --> 00:22:16.880]   I think we need to take heed.
[00:22:16.880 --> 00:22:18.240]   How did they get to this point?
[00:22:18.240 --> 00:22:20.080]   It's not something that just happened overnight.
[00:22:20.080 --> 00:22:26.040]   This was characteristic of the nation of Israel, and again, I think it serves as a warning
[00:22:26.040 --> 00:22:32.480]   to anybody who's in the Christian community, in the circle of post-Christian culture, where
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:37.600]   we just kind of have a tendency to assume the most fundamental things, just like the
[00:22:37.600 --> 00:22:38.600]   Jews did.
[00:22:38.600 --> 00:22:40.280]   So there's four things that he mentions here.
[00:22:40.280 --> 00:22:44.760]   One, he said God judged them by giving them a spirit of stupor.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.560]   Now some of these overlap, but I'm going to mention four things.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:49.880]   So one is God gave them a spirit of stupor.
[00:22:49.880 --> 00:22:55.360]   Second, their eyes that would not—God gave them eyes that would not see and ears that
[00:22:55.360 --> 00:22:56.680]   would not hear.
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:23:02.640]   Thirdly, he says, their tables will become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and
[00:23:02.640 --> 00:23:03.640]   a retribution.
[00:23:03.640 --> 00:23:07.920]   Fourthly, he says, their backs will be bent because of their blindness.
[00:23:07.920 --> 00:23:14.400]   So I want to look at these four things and how did these things lead to them becoming
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:15.400]   so blind.
[00:23:15.400 --> 00:23:19.440]   First, he says God gave them a spirit of stupor.
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:25.800]   The word spirit of stupor basically means to slumber or to be dull.
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:31.560]   John Stott calls this complete loss of spiritual sensitivity.
[00:23:31.560 --> 00:23:37.760]   That maybe at one point you were sensitive, but for whatever the reason, you become slumber,
[00:23:37.760 --> 00:23:39.760]   slow, lukewarm.
[00:23:39.760 --> 00:23:45.680]   We become so spiritually insensitive that even with the Messiah standing before them,
[00:23:45.680 --> 00:23:47.200]   they wouldn't recognize him.
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:53.860]   Their hearts became so numb that they couldn't recognize the voice of the Messiah compared
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:57.000]   to the voice of false prophets.
[00:23:57.000 --> 00:24:04.440]   Spiritual dullness, which is oftentimes described in the scripture as lukewarmness or in the
[00:24:04.440 --> 00:24:11.200]   book of Hebrews to be drifting and simply neglecting.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:14.840]   You might ask the question, well, if that's the case, if God gave them a spirit of stupor
[00:24:14.840 --> 00:24:20.600]   so that they would become insensitive spiritually and lukewarm, then how can God say it's their
[00:24:20.600 --> 00:24:23.920]   fault if God's the one who gave them the spirit of stupor?
[00:24:23.920 --> 00:24:27.880]   Well, turn with me to Isaiah chapter 29, 9 through 10.
[00:24:27.880 --> 00:24:33.240]   Paul is actually quoting a specific text in Isaiah chapter 29, verse 10, but we have to
[00:24:33.240 --> 00:24:38.200]   understand the verse in chapter in verse 9 to see the whole context.
[00:24:38.200 --> 00:24:45.040]   Isaiah chapter 29, verse 9, he begins by saying, "Astonish yourselves and be astonished.
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.640]   Blind yourselves and be blind.
[00:24:46.640 --> 00:24:48.880]   Be drunk, but not with wine.
[00:24:48.880 --> 00:24:51.800]   Sagger, but not with strong drink."
[00:24:51.800 --> 00:24:56.720]   In other words, before he gets to verse 10 and saying he gave them a spirit of stupor,
[00:24:56.720 --> 00:25:01.280]   he says, "If you continue to blind yourself, you will be blind.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:06.280]   If you continue to astonish yourself by other things, then he's going to let you go."
[00:25:06.280 --> 00:25:09.920]   So in other words, he's not taking a group of people who are passionately seeking God
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:11.120]   in love and then he says, "You know what?
[00:25:11.120 --> 00:25:14.160]   I'm going to judge you and turn your heart cold."
[00:25:14.160 --> 00:25:18.600]   His judgment basically is, if you continue to go down this path.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:21.680]   At some point, the judgment is going to be, "Then go."
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:27.640]   He says, "If God speaks and over and over again you say, 'I don't want to hear it,'
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:31.320]   and at some point God is saying, 'I will no longer speak.'
[00:25:31.320 --> 00:25:37.480]   If God is revealing his glory and he's trying to get them to move and they keep on closing
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:41.720]   and turning the other way, at some point he says, 'I will stop revealing my glory.'"
[00:25:41.720 --> 00:25:43.400]   And that's exactly what he is saying here.
[00:25:43.400 --> 00:25:48.580]   He says he gave them a spirit of stupor and he allowed them to pursue what they were committed
[00:25:48.580 --> 00:25:49.580]   to pursue.
[00:25:49.580 --> 00:25:53.920]   Again, in Psalm chapter 81, verse 10-12, it says, "I am the Lord your God who brought
[00:25:53.920 --> 00:25:56.560]   you up out of the land of Egypt.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.920]   Open your mouth wide and I will fill it.
[00:25:59.920 --> 00:26:02.680]   But my people did not listen to my voice.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:04.200]   Israel would not submit to me.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:10.720]   So I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to follow their own counsels."
[00:26:10.720 --> 00:26:14.480]   He says the reason why he gave them a spirit of stupor is because that's exactly what they
[00:26:14.480 --> 00:26:16.120]   were doing.
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.440]   That's exactly what they were committed to.
[00:26:18.440 --> 00:26:21.420]   They didn't want to hear what God had to tell them.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:26.040]   When God sent prophets to rebuke them and warn them about judgment, basically they said,
[00:26:26.040 --> 00:26:28.280]   "We don't want to hear it."
[00:26:28.280 --> 00:26:32.480]   And they'd rather have false prophets telling them that everything is okay and God loves
[00:26:32.480 --> 00:26:33.480]   you.
[00:26:33.480 --> 00:26:34.480]   You're the apple of his eye.
[00:26:34.480 --> 00:26:35.640]   Why would God judge you?
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:41.160]   And they deliberately chose to listen to them rather than the prophets that God gave.
[00:26:41.160 --> 00:26:47.320]   And he said, "Because of that, I will give you a spirit of stupor."
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:54.400]   Our insensitivity towards spiritual things is simply God releasing us in our rebellion
[00:26:54.400 --> 00:26:55.400]   against God.
[00:26:55.400 --> 00:26:57.360]   "You don't want to listen?
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:59.360]   Then I will stop speaking.
[00:26:59.360 --> 00:27:00.720]   You don't want to submit?
[00:27:00.720 --> 00:27:02.680]   Then I will stop calling.
[00:27:02.680 --> 00:27:04.600]   You're going to harden your heart?
[00:27:04.600 --> 00:27:06.560]   Then I will harden it further."
[00:27:06.560 --> 00:27:11.320]   In Romans chapter 1, 24-25, it says, "Therefore God gave them up in their lust of their hearts
[00:27:11.320 --> 00:27:12.400]   of impurity."
[00:27:12.400 --> 00:27:14.520]   God gave them up.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.480]   God didn't take somebody who was godly and turn them over to impurity.
[00:27:18.480 --> 00:27:23.800]   He says, "They were going after impurity and they were refusing to submit, so he said,
[00:27:23.800 --> 00:27:25.560]   'Then go ahead.'"
[00:27:25.560 --> 00:27:27.920]   And that was the final judgment.
[00:27:27.920 --> 00:27:31.720]   He says, "To the dishonoring of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:37.000]   truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the Creator, a creature rather than
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:39.960]   the Creator, who is blessed forever.
[00:27:39.960 --> 00:27:41.800]   Amen."
[00:27:41.800 --> 00:27:47.720]   Spiritual backsliding doesn't happen because you made a decision to do so.
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:52.560]   Spiritual backsliding often happens simply out of neglect.
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.520]   Lukewarmness is not a decision that you make.
[00:27:55.520 --> 00:28:03.880]   It is a dullness of us constantly refusing his call.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:07.480]   When we refuse God, we never say no.
[00:28:07.480 --> 00:28:10.160]   We never say no because you know enough.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:12.720]   Who's going to come before God and say, "I disagree with you.
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:14.640]   I refuse to submit to you."
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.480]   We don't refuse God that way.
[00:28:18.480 --> 00:28:22.360]   Typically the way we refuse God is we say, "Not now.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:23.920]   Not now."
[00:28:23.920 --> 00:28:26.400]   Because by saying not now, we are submitting.
[00:28:26.400 --> 00:28:28.520]   It's just not at this time.
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:30.520]   Not in this particular circumstance.
[00:28:30.520 --> 00:28:31.520]   Not now.
[00:28:31.520 --> 00:28:36.560]   See, basically what God is saying is, "If not now," and you keep saying not now, at
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:38.920]   some point it will never be now.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.840]   That's why in Hebrews chapter 3, verse 7, it says, "Therefore, as the Holy Spirit says,
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:47.440]   'Today, today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts and end the rebellion on
[00:28:47.440 --> 00:28:49.320]   the day of testing in the wilderness.'"
[00:28:49.320 --> 00:28:53.800]   In other words, what he's saying is when God is speaking to you today, it's his kindness
[00:28:53.800 --> 00:28:56.520]   that caused you to be convicted.
[00:28:56.520 --> 00:29:03.040]   If you refuse his kindness to bring you to repentance, today, tomorrow, God may not convict
[00:29:03.040 --> 00:29:04.760]   you.
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.920]   I hear people saying all the time.
[00:29:06.920 --> 00:29:12.760]   "In the Christian community, you can't say no because that would be rebelling against
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:13.760]   God.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.120]   That would not be Christian."
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.680]   We know enough that we need to submit, that God caused us to pick up our cross, but we
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:20.960]   don't say no.
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.240]   We say, "Not now.
[00:29:23.240 --> 00:29:25.040]   Not in this circumstance.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:26.040]   Not while I'm young.
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:27.160]   Not while I'm at school.
[00:29:27.160 --> 00:29:28.680]   Not when I have tests.
[00:29:28.680 --> 00:29:30.360]   Not when I have children.
[00:29:30.360 --> 00:29:32.420]   Not when I have these financial issues.
[00:29:32.420 --> 00:29:34.960]   Not when I have these trips planned.
[00:29:34.960 --> 00:29:37.120]   It's not now."
[00:29:37.120 --> 00:29:42.360]   Not realizing, not now, that tomorrow, God is not at the door just saying, "Okay, is
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:43.360]   it time now?
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:44.360]   Is it time now?"
[00:29:44.360 --> 00:29:49.040]   Again, in Hebrews chapter 3, verse 13, it says, "But exhort one another every day, as
[00:29:49.040 --> 00:29:55.760]   long as it is called today, that none of you may be hardened by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:00.280]   Whenever God calls and we say, "Not now," we become that much more hardened toward our
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:02.160]   sin.
[00:30:02.160 --> 00:30:08.000]   Even though in our mind, we didn't refuse Him, we just postponed obedience.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:12.560]   Any of you who's raising children, you know when you tell your child to do something and
[00:30:12.560 --> 00:30:15.560]   they say, "Not now," you don't think of it as like, "Oh, my obedient son.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:18.040]   He's just not ready."
[00:30:18.040 --> 00:30:19.760]   That's not what the kid is thinking.
[00:30:19.760 --> 00:30:21.280]   The kid is thinking, "I just said not now.
[00:30:21.280 --> 00:30:23.360]   I didn't say no."
[00:30:23.360 --> 00:30:25.400]   But a parent doesn't hear, "Not now."
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:27.400]   The parent hears, "No."
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.960]   When I ask you to do something, I mean to do it.
[00:30:29.960 --> 00:30:33.640]   The only reason why you're postponing it is because you don't want to do it.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:39.140]   I'm waiting for my motivation to kick in.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:48.640]   I hear so many people thinking that the grace of God will always be there no matter what.
[00:30:48.640 --> 00:30:53.520]   I've been working with young people and I've seen the gamut of them, a lot of the young
[00:30:53.520 --> 00:30:56.560]   people that I work with now in their 40s.
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:01.880]   So many of them have said, "Yeah, but just not right now.
[00:31:01.880 --> 00:31:09.400]   I really want to serve God, but after this, after I get my job and my career, my children,
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:12.800]   all of this, after this is all set up, then I can think seriously about what I can do."
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:18.840]   So I always have plans to serve God and go to the mission field sometime in the future.
[00:31:18.840 --> 00:31:26.440]   But when days go by, I meet them two, three years later, they're never in the same spot.
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:31.480]   They're always much more hardened than when I first met them.
[00:31:31.480 --> 00:31:35.560]   They're much more callous than when I first met them.
[00:31:35.560 --> 00:31:39.460]   People never reject Christ by saying no.
[00:31:39.460 --> 00:31:43.800]   How many of you have met people who are really hostile to the gospel?
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:46.120]   Some of you may have.
[00:31:46.120 --> 00:31:51.080]   Majority of the people that I meet are not hostile to the gospel.
[00:31:51.080 --> 00:31:53.280]   I mean, I've experienced some of it.
[00:31:53.280 --> 00:31:56.520]   I remember when I was younger, I got so zealous in sharing the gospel.
[00:31:56.520 --> 00:32:00.120]   I went out to the mall and I started sharing and this guy was not interested.
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:04.840]   And my youth kicked in and said, "I got to share anyway."
[00:32:04.840 --> 00:32:07.320]   And I kept on sharing and he got angry with me.
[00:32:07.320 --> 00:32:12.480]   And then the more angry he got, the more motivated I got, because maybe I'm going to be persecuted
[00:32:12.480 --> 00:32:14.120]   for his name.
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:19.120]   And he got so angry, he chased me out of the mall with a broom.
[00:32:19.120 --> 00:32:25.000]   And I left feeling good about myself, because I got persecuted.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:27.840]   Majority of the response that I've gotten for sharing the gospel was not that.
[00:32:27.840 --> 00:32:31.520]   I can think of a few instances where people actually got angry.
[00:32:31.520 --> 00:32:36.400]   Majority of the times, it's, "Well, I'm glad that you believe that.
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:38.160]   I'm glad that you believe that.
[00:32:38.160 --> 00:32:39.160]   I just don't.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:43.360]   I'm glad it works for you, but it doesn't work for me."
[00:32:43.360 --> 00:32:48.400]   Majority of the times, even in the church, it's never a no.
[00:32:48.400 --> 00:32:49.480]   It's never a no.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   It's maybe not now.
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:55.640]   Maybe sometime in the future.
[00:32:55.640 --> 00:33:03.160]   Our biggest struggle, in our mind, isn't disobedience.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:07.000]   Even though it may lead to disobedience, even though in God's eyes, He probably thinks it's
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:12.240]   disobedience, but in our mind, it's just distraction.
[00:33:12.240 --> 00:33:17.200]   We've given so much of our time and effort to things that don't matter at all in eternity,
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:21.160]   and our hearts are filled with the things that have nothing to do with God, and hearts
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:24.840]   become callous and more and more callous.
[00:33:24.840 --> 00:33:26.280]   We hear, but we do not hear.
[00:33:26.280 --> 00:33:28.760]   We see, but we do not see.
[00:33:28.760 --> 00:33:32.760]   The things that used to excite us and say, "Oh, somebody came to Christ," and be exciting
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:37.160]   for us, but our hearts become so dull that when you hear that somebody came to Christ,
[00:33:37.160 --> 00:33:38.800]   like, "That's great."
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:41.580]   And that's about how long it lasts.
[00:33:41.580 --> 00:33:45.280]   We become so callous to the things of God.
[00:33:45.280 --> 00:33:49.480]   He says, number two, their eyes, they would see and not see.
[00:33:49.480 --> 00:33:52.240]   They would have ears, and yet not hear.
[00:33:52.240 --> 00:33:56.480]   In Romans 1, 19-20, it says, "For what can be known about God is plain to them, because
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:33:58.680]   God has shown it to them.
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:02.920]   For His invisible attributes, namely His eternal power and divine nature, have been clearly
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:06.900]   perceived ever since the creation of the world in the things that have been made, so they
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:09.480]   are without excuse."
[00:34:09.480 --> 00:34:11.960]   It's not that God shut their eyes and said, "You know what?
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:15.720]   I'm going to play hide and seek, and I'm going to show myself only to those people, to some
[00:34:15.720 --> 00:34:16.720]   of those people.
[00:34:16.720 --> 00:34:18.200]   And the rest of you, I'm just going to close your eyes."
[00:34:18.200 --> 00:34:19.400]   He didn't say that.
[00:34:19.400 --> 00:34:22.240]   He said He made it very clear.
[00:34:22.240 --> 00:34:23.240]   He made it very clear.
[00:34:23.240 --> 00:34:28.880]   He left an imprint to lead all creation to Him, and yet they said they refused to see
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:30.840]   the glory of God.
[00:34:30.840 --> 00:34:35.520]   Not because He was hiding, but because our hearts were darkened.
[00:34:35.520 --> 00:34:37.720]   How can you look at the universe?
[00:34:37.720 --> 00:34:42.080]   And again, I'm no scientist, but just common sense, and I look at how our body works and
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:44.080]   how fragile our life is.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:48.040]   If we don't have proper blood circulation, if our heart doesn't work properly, if our
[00:34:48.040 --> 00:34:53.200]   lungs break down, if our liver doesn't work, any part of our organs doesn't work, we're
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:54.200]   dead.
[00:34:54.200 --> 00:34:58.040]   If the earth rotates too fast, if it rotates too slow, if we're too far from the sun, too
[00:34:58.040 --> 00:35:02.200]   close to the sun, and we're all freaking out to death that this ozone layer is going to
[00:35:02.200 --> 00:35:04.040]   break and we're going to die.
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:07.500]   That one crazy guy in North Korea is going to push a button and we're going to die.
[00:35:07.500 --> 00:35:09.720]   That there's going to be some storm coming and there's going to be flood, we're going
[00:35:09.720 --> 00:35:10.720]   to die.
[00:35:10.720 --> 00:35:13.360]   I mean, our life is so fragile.
[00:35:13.360 --> 00:35:14.360]   And it is fragile.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:18.600]   And the only reason why we are being sustained is by the power of God.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:22.960]   So it's just to me, it doesn't make any sense to look at the intricacies of how every one
[00:35:22.960 --> 00:35:27.560]   of these things have to work together just to live, and then to say, "All that happened
[00:35:27.560 --> 00:35:30.000]   by chance."
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.240]   The reason why I got long legs is because you had to run further, so Mother Nature just
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.680]   decided to give you long legs.
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:36.760]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:40.040]   My ancestors had to lift heavy things, so He gave us stocky legs.
[00:35:40.040 --> 00:35:44.400]   And it just happened that way.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:46.480]   It just happened.
[00:35:46.480 --> 00:35:52.200]   How can you see what you see, what God has made, and then not to see His glory?
[00:35:52.200 --> 00:35:54.320]   The scripture says, "Because our hearts were darkened."
[00:35:54.320 --> 00:35:59.660]   Second Corinthians 4.3, it says, "And even if our gospel is veiled, it is veiled only
[00:35:59.660 --> 00:36:02.020]   to those who are perishing.
[00:36:02.020 --> 00:36:05.800]   In their case, the God of this world has blinded the minds of the unbelievers to keep them
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:09.160]   from seeing the light of the gospel of the glory of Christ."
[00:36:09.160 --> 00:36:13.040]   Who is the image of God?
[00:36:13.040 --> 00:36:20.440]   To have God reveal His glory, and then to say, "I don't see it."
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:23.720]   I mean, Jesus performed all those miracles in front of those people, but they kept on
[00:36:23.720 --> 00:36:24.720]   coming to Him.
[00:36:24.720 --> 00:36:25.720]   What did they ask Him?
[00:36:25.720 --> 00:36:26.720]   "Give us a sign."
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:31.160]   Again, remember John chapter 6?
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.780]   All 5,000 people ate the miraculous bread.
[00:36:34.780 --> 00:36:38.720]   And then when they saw Him on the other side, Jesus said, "Don't work for food that is
[00:36:38.720 --> 00:36:41.000]   temporal but for eternal."
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:42.240]   And then remember what they said?
[00:36:42.240 --> 00:36:45.720]   "Then show us a sign."
[00:36:45.720 --> 00:36:47.120]   I mean, Jesus had been showing signs.
[00:36:47.120 --> 00:36:51.680]   They ate the miraculous food, and they said, "Well, we need more signs."
[00:36:51.680 --> 00:36:54.960]   They were completely blind.
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:01.360]   You know, when we become spiritually insensitive and dull, we're not able to discern even right
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:02.360]   or wrong.
[00:37:02.360 --> 00:37:04.720]   We can be completely right, but we can be completely wrong.
[00:37:04.720 --> 00:37:11.160]   I mean, when our hearts become dull, we're not in a position to determine what is holy
[00:37:11.160 --> 00:37:12.160]   and not holy.
[00:37:12.160 --> 00:37:16.360]   I keep hearing arguments from people saying, "How do we determine what is holy and not
[00:37:16.360 --> 00:37:21.560]   holy based upon if I'm not bothered by it?"
[00:37:21.560 --> 00:37:25.400]   I keep hearing people saying, "Well, when I watch this and when I do this, it doesn't
[00:37:25.400 --> 00:37:26.400]   bother me."
[00:37:26.400 --> 00:37:27.720]   If it bothers you, you shouldn't do it.
[00:37:27.720 --> 00:37:31.160]   "So it doesn't bother me, so it's okay."
[00:37:31.160 --> 00:37:35.300]   At what point in Scripture did the Scripture say, "If it doesn't bother you, I'm okay
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.040]   with it?"
[00:37:37.040 --> 00:37:41.160]   Maybe the reason why we're not bothered by it is because our hearts have become so callous
[00:37:41.160 --> 00:37:43.600]   and dull.
[00:37:43.600 --> 00:37:48.560]   If you're even refusing God and refusing God, and our hearts become so callous, how can
[00:37:48.560 --> 00:37:56.080]   you use that callous heart to determine what is acceptable and unacceptable before God?
[00:37:56.080 --> 00:38:00.000]   The Scripture says if you keep going down that path, at some point, God's going to
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.160]   give you a spirit of stupor.
[00:38:03.160 --> 00:38:04.640]   You're going to see, but you're not going to see.
[00:38:04.640 --> 00:38:06.840]   You have ears, but you're not going to hear.
[00:38:06.840 --> 00:38:11.720]   I don't know how many people who grew up in the church and try to talk about them the
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:13.800]   gospel, and they don't understand the gospel.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:15.640]   They can't articulate the gospel.
[00:38:15.640 --> 00:38:19.180]   And I know it's not because they didn't hear it.
[00:38:19.180 --> 00:38:22.720]   And I know some of their pastors, and I know that they preach the gospel.
[00:38:22.720 --> 00:38:26.820]   How can you be sitting under that teaching every single week and then not be able to
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.880]   explain the core of the gospel message?
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:33.280]   They have eyes that cannot see.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.600]   They have ears, but they do not hear.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.340]   And God gave them over to spirit of stupor.
[00:38:40.340 --> 00:38:45.320]   The third thing he says, "Their tables will become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block
[00:38:45.320 --> 00:38:47.160]   and retribution."
[00:38:47.160 --> 00:38:53.840]   The table, the way the Bible writes it, is talking about a place that symbolizes for
[00:38:53.840 --> 00:38:58.440]   the nation of Israel, a place of peace and security.
[00:38:58.440 --> 00:39:03.240]   So in Psalm 23 verses 4 to 5, this is a text that we all know, where it says, "Even though
[00:39:03.240 --> 00:39:06.640]   I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I will fear no evil, for you are with
[00:39:06.640 --> 00:39:10.120]   me, your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[00:39:10.120 --> 00:39:14.680]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies."
[00:39:14.680 --> 00:39:19.420]   He's comparing what he said in verse 4 with verse 5, and he's taking it to the next level.
[00:39:19.420 --> 00:39:27.800]   He says, "Your rod and your staff, they will comfort me, just as you will prepare for me
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:29.600]   a table even before my enemies."
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.340]   In other words, he says, even in the context of all your enemies, God's going to prepare
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:38.060]   a table to sustain you, to give you peace, to bless you.
[00:39:38.060 --> 00:39:44.680]   So the table that Paul is mentioning here, is quoting, is basically saying that this
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:50.920]   table that you relied on for safety and sustenance, will turn around to become a trap, a stumbling
[00:39:50.920 --> 00:39:52.640]   block and retribution.
[00:39:52.640 --> 00:39:57.000]   Again, we see it again in Revelation chapter 320, where Jesus is standing at the door,
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:01.240]   knock, and he says, "If you open the door, I will come into you and dine with you and
[00:40:01.240 --> 00:40:03.240]   you with me."
[00:40:03.240 --> 00:40:08.420]   So he describes repentance and restoration as dining with him.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:15.980]   So this idea of the table and dining is to find peace and blessing and safety.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:23.080]   So the judgment that is being proclaimed in this text is that those things that the Jews,
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:29.780]   that the nation of Israel was seeking for peace, for seeking for sustenance, rather
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:37.340]   than giving them that, will end up becoming a trap, a stumbling block, and even retribution,
[00:40:37.340 --> 00:40:40.220]   Now, what could he be possibly talking about?
[00:40:40.220 --> 00:40:43.540]   Obviously, in the context, he's talking about the law.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:47.340]   That the Jews pursued the law, thinking that that's where they were going to find peace.
[00:40:47.340 --> 00:40:51.980]   If they kept the Sabbath perfectly, that they were going to find blessing.
[00:40:51.980 --> 00:40:56.380]   And every single day, they greeted each other by saying, "Shalom!"
[00:40:56.380 --> 00:40:57.380]   Peace!
[00:40:57.380 --> 00:40:58.380]   Peace be unto you!
[00:40:58.380 --> 00:40:59.380]   Peace be unto you!
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:04.220]   And they thought that the path of peace was through keeping this law.
[00:41:04.220 --> 00:41:07.100]   But instead, what did Paul say in the beginning?
[00:41:07.100 --> 00:41:09.900]   Those with the law will be judged by the law.
[00:41:09.900 --> 00:41:13.140]   Those without the law will be judged without the law.
[00:41:13.140 --> 00:41:19.620]   So the very thing that they thought was going to bring life was going to bring judgment.
[00:41:19.620 --> 00:41:25.580]   The very thing that they pursued, it became their stumbling block.
[00:41:25.580 --> 00:41:33.300]   Martin Luther, in describing this judgment, says this, "It is like a flower in a field
[00:41:33.300 --> 00:41:37.220]   whose nectar is used to make honey for the bee.
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:39.660]   But the nectar is poison to the spider.
[00:41:39.660 --> 00:41:42.300]   To those who are being saved, the word of God is sweetness and honey.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:47.260]   But for those who are perishing, it becomes poison."
[00:41:47.260 --> 00:41:53.140]   The very thing that we pursue, that the Jews pursued, turned out to be their source of
[00:41:53.140 --> 00:41:56.860]   judgment.
[00:41:56.860 --> 00:42:01.460]   The table that he is describing, obviously to the Jews, it was the law.
[00:42:01.460 --> 00:42:05.660]   But this is applicable to us even if we are not Jews.
[00:42:05.660 --> 00:42:12.580]   Basically, anything that we place in our pursuit and our hope where Christ ought to be, eventually
[00:42:12.580 --> 00:42:15.340]   becomes a trap.
[00:42:15.340 --> 00:42:20.100]   If we put our confidence in our friendship, that can easily become a trap.
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:29.540]   If our refuge is found in money, it easily becomes a source of a trap, retribution.
[00:42:29.540 --> 00:42:33.700]   Anything that we place where God was supposed to be, God is supposed to be.
[00:42:33.700 --> 00:42:41.380]   If you think about the sin of Adam and Eve, of eating the fruit of knowledge of good and
[00:42:41.380 --> 00:42:50.860]   evil, that simple sin, and we can almost say it's innocent, and yet that innocent sin led
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:42:53.980]   to condemnation of mankind.
[00:42:53.980 --> 00:42:59.420]   Compare that to the sin that you may have even committed this week.
[00:42:59.420 --> 00:43:05.380]   Think about the things that we commit, both things that we know or don't know.
[00:43:05.380 --> 00:43:07.900]   In comparison, we're kind of like, "Well, it's not bad.
[00:43:07.900 --> 00:43:10.140]   At least it's not as bad as those people."
[00:43:10.140 --> 00:43:13.060]   But compare that to Adam and Eve, what they did.
[00:43:13.060 --> 00:43:18.940]   What Adam and Eve did was very innocent in comparison to most sins that you and I have
[00:43:18.940 --> 00:43:20.060]   very intimate knowledge of.
[00:43:20.060 --> 00:43:26.540]   But why did that particular sin lead to condemnation and death, not only for them, but all descendants
[00:43:26.540 --> 00:43:28.580]   from that point on?
[00:43:28.580 --> 00:43:33.160]   Because at the core of that sin was a rebellion against God.
[00:43:33.160 --> 00:43:38.140]   At the core of that sin, instead of receiving life and wisdom from God, they sought it outside
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:40.780]   of Him, saying, "I'm going to live.
[00:43:40.780 --> 00:43:43.980]   I'm not going to trust in you, and I'm going to live on my own."
[00:43:43.980 --> 00:43:47.060]   They sought wisdom outside of God.
[00:43:47.060 --> 00:43:53.980]   Anything that replaces God as Lord will eventually lead to a trap, a stumbling, and a retribution.
[00:43:53.980 --> 00:43:57.020]   So at the core of that sin, it wasn't just the act in itself.
[00:43:57.020 --> 00:44:02.460]   It's a rebellion in their heart that chooses to find life somewhere else.
[00:44:02.460 --> 00:44:09.340]   When you see it that way, when you see the heart of the sin, it may at times seem very
[00:44:09.340 --> 00:44:10.340]   innocent.
[00:44:10.340 --> 00:44:15.200]   In fact, we may even look righteous on the outside.
[00:44:15.200 --> 00:44:21.660]   We may be seeking certain things inside the church by serving, by giving, but at the core
[00:44:21.660 --> 00:44:25.580]   of it, it's not to serve Christ.
[00:44:25.580 --> 00:44:26.580]   It's not to honor Him.
[00:44:26.580 --> 00:44:28.380]   It's not to worship Him.
[00:44:28.380 --> 00:44:35.100]   Even in the church, even in our passionate pursuit, it could be finding our safety, our
[00:44:35.100 --> 00:44:39.700]   worth in something else outside of Christ.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:48.180]   And all it does is lead to bitterness, a stumbling.
[00:44:48.180 --> 00:44:55.700]   Our hearts are so fickle, and it's constant in rebellion against God.
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.220]   And sometimes, a lot of times, we don't even know it.
[00:44:58.220 --> 00:45:02.060]   We can give ourselves to something and be completely blind.
[00:45:02.060 --> 00:45:06.820]   You know, the most bitter people in the world that I've met, and I'm sure I haven't met
[00:45:06.820 --> 00:45:11.900]   a lot of people, but at least the people that I've met are pastors.
[00:45:11.900 --> 00:45:14.820]   You know, I used to hear that when I was a young pastor, that pastors, you know, usually
[00:45:14.820 --> 00:45:19.340]   the retired pastors, their hearts are dark, and they're black.
[00:45:19.340 --> 00:45:23.860]   You know, and I understood it because I grew up in a pastor's family, and I saw all the
[00:45:23.860 --> 00:45:27.420]   mess, and that's why I didn't want to be a pastor.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:28.420]   But I see why.
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:32.060]   You know, now that I've been in ministry a certain period, and you know, when I meet
[00:45:32.060 --> 00:45:35.820]   young pastors in their 20s, they're the ones usually with a lot of vision.
[00:45:35.820 --> 00:45:39.620]   You know, I'm going to do this, and you know, I found a new way of doing church, and we
[00:45:39.620 --> 00:45:44.260]   have this new cutting way, and they're always excited about going to conferences.
[00:45:44.260 --> 00:45:49.020]   And then you meet pastors in their 30s, and they've kind of gotten punched in the face
[00:45:49.020 --> 00:45:50.420]   a few times already, you know.
[00:45:50.420 --> 00:45:52.100]   They're not beaten up yet.
[00:45:52.100 --> 00:45:54.140]   They've just been punched.
[00:45:54.140 --> 00:45:56.780]   And so it's not as idealistic.
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:46:01.780]   They're not idealistic about ministry, and they're not as eager to jump in and do something,
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:05.380]   and they're kind of like, they're a little bit more cautious, right.
[00:46:05.380 --> 00:46:07.420]   But they haven't beaten up yet.
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.940]   They've just been punched a few times.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:18.460]   When I meet guys who are in their 50s and over, you know, they're one messed up people.
[00:46:18.460 --> 00:46:23.020]   You know, and I have friends that every once in a while I'll meet and talk to them, and
[00:46:23.020 --> 00:46:26.660]   most of the times we'll share our stories, you know.
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:30.980]   And a friend of mine, again, I had a friend who came up to the retreat, to the BAM retreat,
[00:46:30.980 --> 00:46:35.420]   and he's gone through a lot in ministry, and I could go through everything he went through,
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:39.420]   but he spent, I mean, he's been in ministry as long as I have, and we're talking about
[00:46:39.420 --> 00:46:42.620]   various things, and he just, you know, on the way up, he just leaned over and asked
[00:46:42.620 --> 00:46:48.060]   me, "Peter," like, because on the surface, it seems like everything's together, and he
[00:46:48.060 --> 00:46:52.660]   said, "Do you ever think about quitting?"
[00:46:52.660 --> 00:46:57.180]   And you know, I didn't want to discourage him, and I said, "Every day."
[00:46:57.180 --> 00:46:58.180]   You know, every...
[00:46:58.180 --> 00:46:59.180]   And he started laughing.
[00:46:59.180 --> 00:47:00.180]   He's like, "No, I'm serious."
[00:47:00.180 --> 00:47:04.300]   You know, like, sometimes I feel like a schizophrenic.
[00:47:04.300 --> 00:47:08.300]   I feel like Sunday night, like, this is the best job in the world, and Monday morning,
[00:47:08.300 --> 00:47:10.060]   I don't know if I can keep doing this.
[00:47:10.060 --> 00:47:13.820]   And then Tuesday night, you know, I want to preach the gospel, you know, and see revival
[00:47:13.820 --> 00:47:16.780]   come, and Wednesday morning, I'd rather dig ditches.
[00:47:16.780 --> 00:47:19.540]   And so it really depends, back and forth.
[00:47:19.540 --> 00:47:24.100]   And I see so many pastors who have been burned out and beaten, and you know, and we have
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:27.660]   our own struggles.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:31.300]   And I realize, and there are times, again, it's honest confession.
[00:47:31.300 --> 00:47:36.380]   There are times when I ask myself, "Is this worth it?"
[00:47:36.380 --> 00:47:38.660]   And I struggle with that at times, okay?
[00:47:38.660 --> 00:47:43.180]   I don't want you to get all discouraged, like, that's how I feel right now, all right?
[00:47:43.180 --> 00:47:47.180]   I feel great right now, all right?
[00:47:47.180 --> 00:47:50.340]   But there are times when I ask myself, "Is this all worth it?"
[00:47:50.340 --> 00:47:51.900]   You know?
[00:47:51.900 --> 00:47:56.540]   And I, because I see frustration, and I see struggles, and you know, I've been at it for
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:48:02.020]   so many years, that maybe the remaining time that I could do something else, and I have
[00:48:02.020 --> 00:48:04.340]   those thoughts.
[00:48:04.340 --> 00:48:08.660]   But when those thoughts come to me, I always have to step back and ask myself, "Why are
[00:48:08.660 --> 00:48:12.820]   you doing it in the first place?"
[00:48:12.820 --> 00:48:18.660]   And I take a step back, and I ask, "It's because if I give, I want to see something.
[00:48:18.660 --> 00:48:22.980]   If I sacrifice, there has to be reward for the sacrifice."
[00:48:22.980 --> 00:48:27.140]   And I have to ask myself, "Is that why you started it?
[00:48:27.140 --> 00:48:31.180]   Because you thought if you gave, God's going to give you something."
[00:48:31.180 --> 00:48:35.900]   And I realize that every time my thoughts go back to that, the very thing that I've
[00:48:35.900 --> 00:48:38.820]   been pursuing becomes a snare.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.460]   It becomes a trap.
[00:48:41.460 --> 00:48:46.700]   Because my heart isn't motivated by the love of Christ.
[00:48:46.700 --> 00:48:48.460]   Can't be sustained.
[00:48:48.460 --> 00:48:51.460]   I can't sustain it.
[00:48:51.460 --> 00:48:55.460]   Whatever small task, whatever big task it is, I can't sustain it, because I don't have
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:56.780]   the energy.
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:02.500]   Wherever, whatever I place where only Christ was supposed to be, even for a minute, if
[00:49:02.500 --> 00:49:07.620]   I put anything else in there, my confidence in you, and I'll just be honest with you,
[00:49:07.620 --> 00:49:10.580]   I don't have any confidence in you.
[00:49:10.580 --> 00:49:14.340]   Don't get hurt by it, because I don't have confidence in myself either.
[00:49:14.340 --> 00:49:17.580]   I shared this with my friend, and he was like, "What?
[00:49:17.580 --> 00:49:18.580]   You said that to the church?"
[00:49:18.580 --> 00:49:21.900]   Yeah, I'm going to say it again today.
[00:49:21.900 --> 00:49:24.700]   I don't have confidence in you.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:27.740]   I don't have confidence in myself.
[00:49:27.740 --> 00:49:33.060]   I don't have confidence in any system that you may think is better.
[00:49:33.060 --> 00:49:35.740]   I don't have confidence in finances.
[00:49:35.740 --> 00:49:37.060]   I don't have confidence in your riches.
[00:49:37.060 --> 00:49:38.620]   I don't have confidence in your experience.
[00:49:38.620 --> 00:49:40.900]   I don't have confidence in any of that.
[00:49:40.900 --> 00:49:42.540]   I've been in ministry long enough.
[00:49:42.540 --> 00:49:46.700]   I know certain things are better, and certain people are smarter, and whatever, but in the
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:51.580]   end, that's not why he called us.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:57.180]   If that's the reason why I do what I do, I don't think I'll keep doing it.
[00:49:57.180 --> 00:50:00.540]   I've lost all confidence in myself.
[00:50:00.540 --> 00:50:08.980]   I've lost all confidence in you, which caused me to see Christ and Christ alone.
[00:50:08.980 --> 00:50:15.780]   The moment I take my eyes off of Christ, despair comes in.
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:20.500]   I don't think I'm going to keep doing it if I can't, which forces me to pray and come
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:26.740]   before God and ask myself, "Why did you start this in the first place?"
[00:50:26.740 --> 00:50:31.540]   He says, "That very table that you think is going to feed you is going to turn into a
[00:50:31.540 --> 00:50:32.860]   snare.
[00:50:32.860 --> 00:50:38.380]   That very thing that you are hoping for is going to turn out to be a stumbling block.
[00:50:38.380 --> 00:50:43.140]   The very thing that you're clinging onto is going to turn out to be your judgment."
[00:50:43.140 --> 00:50:47.260]   And fourthly, it says, "Their backs will be bent because of their blindness."
[00:50:47.260 --> 00:50:52.420]   Basically it's a description of somebody where burden is so heavy that he bends his back.
[00:50:52.420 --> 00:50:56.060]   When you lift something that is not that heavy, you just lift it, but when it's heavy, you
[00:50:56.060 --> 00:50:57.580]   tend to bend your back.
[00:50:57.580 --> 00:51:01.900]   And that's the description that he's making, that the very thing that you thought was going
[00:51:01.900 --> 00:51:08.780]   to give you life is going to be so burdensome that your back is going to be bent forever.
[00:51:08.780 --> 00:51:10.540]   Isn't that exactly what happened to the Jews?
[00:51:10.540 --> 00:51:12.860]   They put all their confidence in the law.
[00:51:12.860 --> 00:51:19.100]   Law ended up becoming their stumbling block, and it became a burden too much for them to
[00:51:19.100 --> 00:51:21.300]   bear.
[00:51:21.300 --> 00:51:28.680]   The very thing that they put their confidence in caused them to be judged.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:37.460]   We look at all of this, and the end conclusion of all of this, and God must be done.
[00:51:37.460 --> 00:51:39.900]   He must be done with us.
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:41.940]   He must be done with the nation of Israel.
[00:51:41.940 --> 00:51:48.740]   If I ended right here, if the Bible ended right there, then we would all be in despair.
[00:51:48.740 --> 00:51:58.420]   Because you know, when we first become a Christian, you know, we read the stories of Israelites,
[00:51:58.420 --> 00:52:02.020]   and I think we look at the Israelites and say, "Man, these are foolish people.
[00:52:02.020 --> 00:52:04.580]   God is so harsh with the nation of Israel."
[00:52:04.580 --> 00:52:10.140]   But the more we study, and the more we live, and the more we fail, the more we realize,
[00:52:10.140 --> 00:52:12.740]   that's me.
[00:52:12.740 --> 00:52:15.740]   That's our description.
[00:52:15.740 --> 00:52:24.340]   And so the end conclusion is, if God was done with them, then we would be done.
[00:52:24.340 --> 00:52:27.660]   So I'm not going to get into it this morning.
[00:52:27.660 --> 00:52:31.900]   So after all of that, that this is the reason why they were so blind.
[00:52:31.900 --> 00:52:33.600]   God gave them over to their blindness.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:35.580]   God gave them over to their hardness.
[00:52:35.580 --> 00:52:39.580]   God gave them over to their pursuit, and it all backfired on them.
[00:52:39.580 --> 00:52:43.340]   And so the natural question is, is that it?
[00:52:43.340 --> 00:52:46.380]   And that's the question that we're going to start with next time.
[00:52:46.380 --> 00:52:53.700]   Verse 11, so I ask, did they stumble in order that they might fall?
[00:52:53.700 --> 00:52:55.980]   Is it done?
[00:52:55.980 --> 00:52:59.980]   Did their hardness got to a point where there is no hope?
[00:52:59.980 --> 00:53:05.300]   And the answer to that is, by no means.
[00:53:05.300 --> 00:53:07.900]   By no means.
[00:53:07.900 --> 00:53:12.820]   You and I are here today because God is a God of covenant.
[00:53:12.820 --> 00:53:13.980]   God is a God of covenant.
[00:53:13.980 --> 00:53:16.540]   Just like he told his disciples, how many times do I forgive them?
[00:53:16.540 --> 00:53:17.540]   Seven times 70?
[00:53:17.540 --> 00:53:18.540]   Right?
[00:53:18.540 --> 00:53:21.220]   Seven times, they know, seven times 70.
[00:53:21.220 --> 00:53:24.480]   As long as they repent, forgive them.
[00:53:24.480 --> 00:53:28.700]   You and I are here today because God is faithful to that covenant.
[00:53:28.700 --> 00:53:33.180]   If he asks for forgiveness, he is faithful and just to forgive all of our unrighteousness.
[00:53:33.180 --> 00:53:35.060]   That's why we are here.
[00:53:35.060 --> 00:53:38.380]   Not because of what we had done, not because we figured out how to do church, not because
[00:53:38.380 --> 00:53:45.340]   we figured out a way to be more clever, but because he said, I will build my church and
[00:53:45.340 --> 00:53:49.740]   the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.
[00:53:49.740 --> 00:53:53.140]   And that is the only reason why we're here.
[00:53:53.140 --> 00:53:57.540]   And that is the only place where we should have confidence.
[00:53:57.540 --> 00:54:02.180]   Christ in Christ alone.
[00:54:02.180 --> 00:54:09.740]   Let's take some time to pray as we ask the worship team to come up.
[00:54:09.740 --> 00:54:15.900]   I don't know about you, but I've been a Christian long enough and I've been a pastor long enough
[00:54:15.900 --> 00:54:21.260]   that everything I've seen work and fail.
[00:54:21.260 --> 00:54:22.260]   Everything.
[00:54:22.260 --> 00:54:29.740]   Small group, leader, follower, discipleship, home groups, you know, study, exposition,
[00:54:29.740 --> 00:54:30.740]   missions.
[00:54:30.740 --> 00:54:32.020]   Like all of it.
[00:54:32.020 --> 00:54:34.220]   It has its time.
[00:54:34.220 --> 00:54:37.460]   You know, bearing fruit, there are seasons of fruitfulness, there are seasons of dryness,
[00:54:37.460 --> 00:54:41.020]   there are seasons of hardship, there are seasons of fellowship, there are seasons that come
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:42.740]   and go.
[00:54:42.740 --> 00:54:44.340]   But in the end, there's always seasons.
[00:54:44.340 --> 00:54:53.500]   And the only thing that is consistent day in and day out is Christ and his love.
[00:54:53.500 --> 00:54:57.700]   We put our confidence in anything else, we're going to be disappointed.
[00:54:57.700 --> 00:54:59.100]   We're going to stumble.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:01.380]   It'll become a trap.
[00:55:01.380 --> 00:55:04.980]   So my encouragement, again, and I believe that this is the encouragement and challenge
[00:55:04.980 --> 00:55:15.020]   in the scripture, over and over and over and over again, fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:55:15.020 --> 00:55:19.060]   I know you've heard it a hundred times.
[00:55:19.060 --> 00:55:22.620]   And you're going to hear it a hundred times more.
[00:55:22.620 --> 00:55:25.500]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:55:25.500 --> 00:55:27.820]   What are you pursuing?
[00:55:27.820 --> 00:55:30.420]   What are you hoping for?
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:35.020]   Who did you desire to meet this morning?
[00:55:35.020 --> 00:55:37.620]   What are you pursuing?
[00:55:37.620 --> 00:55:42.980]   What are you waiting for with your retirement?
[00:55:42.980 --> 00:55:46.100]   Fix your eyes upon Jesus.
[00:55:46.100 --> 00:55:47.100]   He's the author.
[00:55:47.100 --> 00:55:48.420]   He's the one who began it.
[00:55:48.420 --> 00:55:51.220]   And he's the one who's going to perfect it.
[00:55:51.220 --> 00:55:53.220]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
