[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews chapter 12, we're going to be in part 2 of
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:12.720]   part 3 in the first 3 verses.
[00:00:12.720 --> 00:00:19.160]   Hebrews chapter 12 verses 1, 2, and 3.
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:23.200]   Reading out of the NASB, "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding
[00:00:23.200 --> 00:00:28.640]   us, let us also lay aside every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and
[00:00:28.640 --> 00:00:32.760]   let us run with endurance the race that is set before us.
[00:00:32.760 --> 00:00:37.240]   Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before him
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.000]   endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand of the throne
[00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:43.080]   of God.
[00:00:43.080 --> 00:00:48.000]   For consider him who has endured such hostility by sinners against himself so that you will
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   not grow weary and lose heart."
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   Let's pray.
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:55.680]   Heavenly Father, we pray for guidance.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.080]   We pray for your Holy Spirit to teach us, to open our eyes, to shape our thoughts, our
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:06.720]   emotions, our will, that it may all be surrendered to your word.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:11.080]   We pray, Father God, that your spirit would guide us, Lord God, that we may be sanctified,
[00:01:11.080 --> 00:01:15.440]   that it would go forth and that your word would not come back until it has accomplished
[00:01:15.440 --> 00:01:17.640]   the purpose you have ordained it.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:20.000]   We ask for your guidance in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   Amen.
[00:01:21.560 --> 00:01:26.320]   All right, so this is part two of what we started last week about running this race.
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:31.800]   And as we mentioned last week, the main imperative in this text is to run with endurance.
[00:01:31.800 --> 00:01:36.100]   In English it says, "Let us fix our eyes, let us do this, let us do that."
[00:01:36.100 --> 00:01:41.760]   And those are all supporting ideas of the main idea of let us run this race.
[00:01:41.760 --> 00:01:48.720]   So the question I want to start with you this morning is, what race are you running?
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:52.080]   And I'm not talking about what race did you sign up for.
[00:01:52.080 --> 00:01:55.480]   What race are you actually running?
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:01:58.240]   We call the race of this life, what do we call it?
[00:01:58.240 --> 00:01:59.400]   What does the world call it?
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:02.160]   What kind of race is it?
[00:02:02.160 --> 00:02:03.160]   Dog race?
[00:02:03.160 --> 00:02:04.960]   No, we call it rat race.
[00:02:04.960 --> 00:02:07.960]   And there's a reason why they call it a rat race, right?
[00:02:07.960 --> 00:02:12.000]   And rat race, everybody is in some kind of a race, right?
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.200]   Competing, trying to get ahead, trying to be somebody.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:16.200]   That's why we go to school.
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:18.280]   That's why we work hard to get promotions.
[00:02:18.280 --> 00:02:22.000]   And we invest money so that we can be at a next level.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:26.820]   And so every one of us is competing in some way.
[00:02:26.820 --> 00:02:28.480]   And we are in some kind of a race.
[00:02:28.480 --> 00:02:33.200]   But are we in the race that the rest of the world is in, or are we in the race that has
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:36.360]   been set before us, right?
[00:02:36.360 --> 00:02:39.040]   The rat race is basically constantly living for the next goal.
[00:02:39.040 --> 00:02:42.620]   So if you're a college student, your primary goal is to graduate and get a job.
[00:02:42.620 --> 00:02:47.520]   If you got a job, your primary goal is to make sure that you get a better job.
[00:02:47.520 --> 00:02:51.200]   And then if you're making enough money, your primary goal next one is to find somebody
[00:02:51.200 --> 00:02:52.200]   to settle down.
[00:02:52.200 --> 00:02:56.720]   And if you're married, your primary goal is to have children and to raise them a certain
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   way.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:01.680]   And then if you lived for a while, your primary goal is to have enough money in retirement
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:03.060]   to retire.
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:05.940]   And then your primary goal is to make sure that your children are taken care of and your
[00:03:05.940 --> 00:03:08.040]   grandchildren are taken care of.
[00:03:08.040 --> 00:03:10.920]   And so that's the rat race.
[00:03:10.920 --> 00:03:13.120]   And it's not necessarily sinful.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.480]   Nevertheless, it is a race that we're constantly concerned about.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:21.000]   And each stage of our life has some other thing that we need to shoot for.
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.880]   And we're constantly told that this is what an average 30-year-old has, an average 40-year-old
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:26.880]   has.
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:29.900]   And by this age, you should have this because that's what everybody else has.
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:35.540]   And so if that's what is driving us, you are in the rat race.
[00:03:35.540 --> 00:03:39.880]   But the race that he has set before us is a race, he says, that we ought to run with
[00:03:39.880 --> 00:03:40.880]   endurance.
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:45.360]   Now, we have 11 chapters of him telling us that this is the right race that you need
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:46.400]   to go to.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:54.520]   And then so chapter 12 and 13 is reminding us that in considering, in considering knowing
[00:03:54.520 --> 00:04:01.920]   who Jesus is, if you confess that Jesus Christ is truly worthy of all our worship and attention,
[00:04:01.920 --> 00:04:03.600]   then we ought to be running this race.
[00:04:03.600 --> 00:04:08.480]   So basically, what he's saying in these three verses is to be calling us out of the rat
[00:04:08.480 --> 00:04:12.520]   race and to make sure that we're running the race that have eternal consequences.
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:18.080]   You know, last week, I finished a message about that man who ran the race in Mexico,
[00:04:18.080 --> 00:04:23.680]   Marathon, and I asked him, "Why did you suffer through with all the injuries that you had
[00:04:23.680 --> 00:04:27.360]   for over 13 miles in order to finish this race?"
[00:04:27.360 --> 00:04:32.920]   And again, he said, "My country did not send me 5,000 miles to start the race.
[00:04:32.920 --> 00:04:37.980]   They sent me 5,000 miles to finish it, even if it took much longer."
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:44.120]   So the call this morning to finish the race, you know, most of us have started the race
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:50.800]   at some point, whether it was when you're a child, maybe in your 20s or 30s or 40s,
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:55.240]   at some point, you met Christ, your eyes were open to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:56.400]   and you began this race.
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:02.240]   But the challenge now is that these listeners, these recipients of this letter, they weren't
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:04.700]   rejecting Christ.
[00:05:04.700 --> 00:05:09.360]   They were in danger of apostasy, not simply because they woke up one morning and realized,
[00:05:09.360 --> 00:05:11.960]   "I don't know if I want to follow Christ."
[00:05:11.960 --> 00:05:13.980]   That wasn't their problem.
[00:05:13.980 --> 00:05:17.320]   Their problem wasn't one day they woke up and realized, "I don't know if I believe in
[00:05:17.320 --> 00:05:18.320]   these doctrines."
[00:05:18.320 --> 00:05:19.840]   That wasn't their problem.
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:25.480]   The pressures of life, the concerns for this world, for the safety of their children, for
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:31.740]   the well-being of their future, caused them to get distracted and begin to ignore this
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:37.780]   great salvation that they have, and they began to drift back into the rat race.
[00:05:37.780 --> 00:05:40.840]   This is not a danger of just a few Christians.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:43.560]   This was not a danger just 2,000 years ago.
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:47.360]   This is our primary danger today.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:51.520]   We talked about last week when he challenged us to run this race with endurance, that we
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.480]   ought to keep our eyes on the race that we're in.
[00:05:53.480 --> 00:05:56.280]   Which race are we actually running, right?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:01.120]   That we may run this race to finish this race, and then to look back and see the cloud of
[00:06:01.120 --> 00:06:05.120]   witnesses that have gone before us who have finished the race as well, that we would see
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:09.400]   them as examples and inspiration for us to persevere in our race.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:13.800]   Today we want to look at verse 1 at the end of it, and when he says, "Let us lay aside
[00:06:13.800 --> 00:06:16.800]   every encumbrance and sin which so easily entangles."
[00:06:16.800 --> 00:06:20.120]   Let us look within, right?
[00:06:20.120 --> 00:06:24.760]   You know, I did a quick search about the persecution, and I've been mentioning, and if you've been
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.360]   following the news, the persecution against Christians has been rising rapidly in the
[00:06:30.360 --> 00:06:32.280]   last few years.
[00:06:32.280 --> 00:06:37.640]   And even in this country, we've been hearing more and more rumors of our government targeting
[00:06:37.640 --> 00:06:44.240]   Christians that if you believe in biblical Christianity, if you do not submit to the
[00:06:44.240 --> 00:06:49.920]   liberal views, and again, that's not a Christianity at all, but if you don't submit to that, we're
[00:06:49.920 --> 00:06:50.920]   going to take away your license.
[00:06:50.920 --> 00:06:55.720]   We're going to take away the ability to be able to do church, your tax exemption plans,
[00:06:55.720 --> 00:06:58.260]   and your schools, and even homeschooling.
[00:06:58.260 --> 00:07:02.080]   Anybody who goes against the indoctrination that the government desires, we're going to
[00:07:02.080 --> 00:07:03.080]   come after you.
[00:07:03.080 --> 00:07:04.080]   And they're openly saying this.
[00:07:04.080 --> 00:07:09.680]   This is for the first time in this country, Christians are actually being targeted.
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:16.680]   But in comparison to what's going on around the world, I mean, we're still living in comfort
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:18.440]   and safety.
[00:07:18.440 --> 00:07:26.360]   According to Open Door's ministry, they said over 250 million Christians are severely persecuted
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:28.960]   around the world today, 250 million.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.240]   We're not talking about people who are just living in a place where it's not popular to
[00:07:33.240 --> 00:07:34.240]   be a Christian.
[00:07:34.240 --> 00:07:37.920]   We're not talking about people who just get shunned at work for your faith.
[00:07:37.920 --> 00:07:42.600]   We're talking about, he says, severe persecution, meaning that you're literally risking your
[00:07:42.600 --> 00:07:48.440]   health, your life, your children, your sustenance in order to follow Christ.
[00:07:48.440 --> 00:07:51.000]   250 million Christians.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:54.880]   One in nine Christians live in intense persecution.
[00:07:54.880 --> 00:08:02.680]   There's been a 14%, 14% rise in this intense persecution in the last few years.
[00:08:02.680 --> 00:08:09.720]   4,136 Christians were martyred for their faith just in 2019, according to record.
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:14.480]   Martyrs, people who've given their life because they follow Christ.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:20.800]   Five years ago, North Korea was the only country on the list of the extreme persecuted countries,
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:21.800]   North Korea.
[00:08:21.800 --> 00:08:25.520]   Today, there are 11 that fit that category.
[00:08:25.520 --> 00:08:31.000]   Out of the 11, India has become number 10.
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.800]   The country after that is Iraq.
[00:08:33.800 --> 00:08:37.840]   If you remember, seven, eight years ago, when we first started going out to India, India
[00:08:37.840 --> 00:08:40.560]   was ranked number 30 or 32.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:41.560]   Every year it's been rising.
[00:08:41.560 --> 00:08:43.120]   Now they're at number 10.
[00:08:43.120 --> 00:08:48.000]   They're in the category of the 11 countries most severely persecuted, meaning that they
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   are literally risking their health and their lives.
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.360]   Again, you've heard stories about our pastors there.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:57.440]   It was tied up and literally left for dead.
[00:08:57.440 --> 00:08:58.800]   That is not unique to them.
[00:08:58.800 --> 00:09:04.720]   That's happening to all these pastors who are trying to share the gospel in remote villages.
[00:09:04.720 --> 00:09:11.360]   As bad as this situation is, that's not where the rubber meets the road for me and you.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:16.680]   It may shake us up and cause us to be concerned when the government threatens to shut us down
[00:09:16.680 --> 00:09:21.560]   because we will not do certain things, and they already tell us that it's coming.
[00:09:21.560 --> 00:09:23.120]   That's not where the rubber meets the road.
[00:09:23.120 --> 00:09:27.400]   Most of us are not shaking in our boots day to day because of the threats that the government
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:29.320]   is making.
[00:09:29.320 --> 00:09:35.000]   We feel bad and we pray for the persecuted church all around the world, but that is not
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:38.960]   the primary problem that you and I face day to day.
[00:09:38.960 --> 00:09:42.380]   John Piper describes it this way in Hunger for God.
[00:09:42.380 --> 00:09:47.240]   The greatest enemy of Hunger for God is not poison, but apple pie.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:52.920]   It is not the banquet of the wicked that dulls our appetite for heaven, but endless nibbling
[00:09:52.920 --> 00:09:55.080]   at the table of the world.
[00:09:55.080 --> 00:10:01.280]   It is not the X-rated videos, but the prime time dribble of triviality we drink in every
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.580]   night.
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:08.480]   It's not the persecution, it's not ISIS, it's not even our own government that is the greatest
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:10.640]   problem for us.
[00:10:10.640 --> 00:10:16.240]   Our greatest source of distraction, which destroys the church today, destroys our faith,
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:24.280]   is the endless, tireless, day to day need to be entertained and amused.
[00:10:24.280 --> 00:10:29.640]   You know, this is probably the only country, at least that I know of, that I hear regularly
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:32.480]   people are bored with their faith.
[00:10:32.480 --> 00:10:33.920]   They're bored.
[00:10:33.920 --> 00:10:36.560]   They're bored because they're comparing it with entertainment.
[00:10:36.560 --> 00:10:40.200]   Everything else seems exciting except their faith.
[00:10:40.200 --> 00:10:45.000]   And part of the reason why is because, just like John Piper says, that we are constantly
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:46.920]   nibbling at the world.
[00:10:46.920 --> 00:10:49.900]   We're not feasting at the world, we're nibbling at the world.
[00:10:49.900 --> 00:10:54.520]   So by the time we come to church, there is no longer an appetite.
[00:10:54.520 --> 00:10:59.080]   And as I mentioned last week, when people backslide, that does not happen overnight.
[00:10:59.080 --> 00:11:00.560]   You don't wake up one day and say, "You know what?
[00:11:00.560 --> 00:11:02.780]   I don't want to follow Christ anymore."
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:08.240]   You see a gradual decline of interest toward Christ, a passion for the lost, and then the
[00:11:08.240 --> 00:11:13.680]   singing of the songs, and when you open up the scriptures, it just seems like dull literature.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:18.200]   It feels more like homework than feeling like you're being spiritually fed.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.800]   And you see a gradual decline and you just accept it as being normal.
[00:11:22.800 --> 00:11:29.800]   So a month passes, weeks pass, weeks pass, years pass, and next thing you know, you become
[00:11:29.800 --> 00:11:34.500]   a great Christian on surface, but inwardly, there is no spiritual hunger.
[00:11:34.500 --> 00:11:40.320]   You remember what you were like when you were younger, but you become cynical.
[00:11:40.320 --> 00:11:42.800]   Even when young people are passionate, it's like, "Yeah, I was like you one time.
[00:11:42.800 --> 00:11:44.280]   I used to do that when I was young."
[00:11:44.280 --> 00:11:46.040]   But you wait until you have kids.
[00:11:46.040 --> 00:11:48.760]   You wait until you have a job.
[00:11:48.760 --> 00:11:50.760]   And this is the pattern.
[00:11:50.760 --> 00:11:54.040]   This is where the church is being destroyed.
[00:11:54.040 --> 00:11:55.320]   We're not simply being distracted.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.560]   The church is being destroyed, not by persecution, not by ISIS, not by the threat of the governments,
[00:12:00.560 --> 00:12:07.760]   but the constant dribble of nibbling at the banquet of the world.
[00:12:07.760 --> 00:12:12.560]   And we will say we're not in the rat race, but every indication is that's exactly the
[00:12:12.560 --> 00:12:14.240]   race that we're in.
[00:12:14.240 --> 00:12:15.660]   We're competing.
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:21.640]   We're perfectly fine with the house that we bought until we see what other person has.
[00:12:21.640 --> 00:12:26.280]   We're perfectly fine with the retirement fund we had until you hear that your friends have
[00:12:26.280 --> 00:12:27.560]   a bigger one.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:32.040]   We're perfectly fine with what our kids are doing until we compare with what other kids
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:34.840]   are doing.
[00:12:34.840 --> 00:12:38.760]   And if we are not careful, we drift into this rat race.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:40.600]   You didn't commit to it.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.800]   You just find yourself one day waking up.
[00:12:43.800 --> 00:12:48.560]   First Corinthians 6.12, it says, "All things are lawful for me, but not all things are
[00:12:48.560 --> 00:12:49.560]   profitable.
[00:12:49.560 --> 00:12:53.120]   All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything."
[00:12:53.120 --> 00:12:55.440]   In this race, it's the first thing that he calls us to.
[00:12:55.440 --> 00:12:57.160]   It's not, "Is it sinful?"
[00:12:57.160 --> 00:13:01.760]   But the first thing that he tells us is, "Is it helpful?"
[00:13:01.760 --> 00:13:03.840]   Is it helpful?
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:10.680]   If all you did was just sign up to the race and your goal is not to finish the race or
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:15.760]   to win the race, we're just satisfied that we're in the race itself.
[00:13:15.760 --> 00:13:23.080]   And if you can put up the next slide.
[00:13:23.080 --> 00:13:24.080]   The next slide.
[00:13:24.080 --> 00:13:25.080]   Yeah, there you go.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:26.080]   All right.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.000]   So this is what we would expect runners to look like, right?
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:32.960]   They got the proper shorts on, right?
[00:13:32.960 --> 00:13:35.160]   They're not carrying any backpacks.
[00:13:35.160 --> 00:13:37.640]   They got the right shoes, right?
[00:13:37.640 --> 00:13:41.720]   They got the shirts and all of them are even wearing tank tops.
[00:13:41.720 --> 00:13:45.320]   It's not even short sleeve because they don't want anything encumbering them, right?
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.880]   So all they have is a number that shows that they're in the race and everything else, you
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:53.840]   know, outside of being naked, right, is necessity.
[00:13:53.840 --> 00:13:58.000]   In fact, a long time ago when they first started the Olympics, they ran naked because they
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:00.500]   didn't have shorts, they didn't have shoes.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:04.440]   So the only way to run without encumbrance is to take off whatever it was that they had
[00:14:04.440 --> 00:14:06.740]   and they competed in the Olympics.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.240]   They wanted every edge, right?
[00:14:09.240 --> 00:14:14.880]   And even the swimmers, some of you guys who swim, you know, those of us who experienced
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:17.300]   swimming just casually, you're not that intense.
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:22.040]   But if you've ever competed, if you've ever known anybody who was like really competed
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:26.880]   as a swimmer, you know, they'll shave off their head if they have to, to get that little
[00:14:26.880 --> 00:14:32.320]   edge because whatever encumbrance that they have that's going to slow them down to not
[00:14:32.320 --> 00:14:36.720]   to win, you know, it's worth getting rid of, right?
[00:14:36.720 --> 00:14:39.800]   This is what we would expect if you can go to the next slide.
[00:14:39.800 --> 00:14:44.440]   This guy clearly is not in the race to win.
[00:14:44.440 --> 00:14:50.360]   My guess is, you know, he's just having fun or maybe his wife told him to lose some weight
[00:14:50.360 --> 00:14:55.360]   and then he signed up but he really wasn't interested so he just kind of in the race.
[00:14:55.360 --> 00:15:00.000]   And then the next guy, these guys clearly don't care, right?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.760]   They're in the race probably to get their picture taken.
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:05.000]   That's their goal.
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:10.120]   So as soon as this picture is taken, I don't believe they may have finished their race,
[00:15:10.120 --> 00:15:11.120]   right?
[00:15:11.120 --> 00:15:12.980]   26 miles, I don't think so, right?
[00:15:12.980 --> 00:15:17.480]   But you can tell just by what they're wearing, they're probably not that serious.
[00:15:17.480 --> 00:15:22.800]   You know, I looked up to see if these marathons have rules and what they can and cannot wear
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.120]   and I realized that there are some marathons were very strict.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:27.920]   You can only have certain things on.
[00:15:27.920 --> 00:15:31.400]   And there are certain marathons where they don't have any regulations.
[00:15:31.400 --> 00:15:33.720]   So you can wear this if you want.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:40.540]   And so if we're asking the question in our pursuit, in our race, is it sinful?
[00:15:40.540 --> 00:15:46.560]   And if that's the standard, and if that's the only standard that we use, is it sinful?
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:50.640]   And it's just like a marathon runner, it's like, well, is it legal?
[00:15:50.640 --> 00:15:55.240]   Like is there anything in the books that says that I can't be dressed like a chicken?
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:15:56.960]   There is no law.
[00:15:56.960 --> 00:15:57.960]   There's no rule.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:03.620]   So I can pay it and get the sign, get my picture taken, and I can say that I ran the marathon.
[00:16:03.620 --> 00:16:07.840]   So on paper, you ran the marathon, but you didn't actually run the marathon.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:11.040]   You just entered the marathon, right?
[00:16:11.040 --> 00:16:16.600]   Sometimes one of the most common questions that we get is, is it sinful?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.560]   And the reason why we get that question is, can I do it?
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:22.960]   How far can I go to the line before I cross it?
[00:16:22.960 --> 00:16:27.520]   And many people are living right on that line.
[00:16:27.520 --> 00:16:29.040]   And they say, I don't know if that's profitable.
[00:16:29.040 --> 00:16:30.040]   I don't know if that's helpful.
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:32.320]   It's like, oh, you legalists.
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:36.120]   Where in the Bible does it say that?
[00:16:36.120 --> 00:16:41.920]   See the instruction that he's given us in order to run this race with endurance to win,
[00:16:41.920 --> 00:16:46.480]   he said first and foremost, he says every encumbrance.
[00:16:46.480 --> 00:16:50.200]   So our standard of running this race to win is, is this helpful?
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:54.360]   Not is it legal, not is it sinful, but is it helpful?
[00:16:54.360 --> 00:16:57.720]   Or does this cause me to slow down?
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:17:03.680]   In 1 Peter 2, 1 through 3, it says, therefore putting aside all malice.
[00:17:03.680 --> 00:17:06.880]   Not some malice, not certain malice that bothers you.
[00:17:06.880 --> 00:17:12.240]   He said all malice, all deceit, and hypocrisy, and envy, and all slander.
[00:17:12.240 --> 00:17:18.280]   Like newborn babies long for the pure milk of the word.
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:23.160]   You know, if you've ever been in the room when a child comes into this world, and it's
[00:17:23.160 --> 00:17:28.720]   amazing because first thing that they do is they want food, right?
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:31.080]   I don't know who taught them, right?
[00:17:31.080 --> 00:17:34.000]   They didn't have special training to drink milk.
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:38.320]   Because if you think about it, for nine months, it's been fed to their stomach, right?
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.320]   So they don't know.
[00:17:39.320 --> 00:17:40.320]   No one's taught them.
[00:17:40.320 --> 00:17:41.400]   It didn't come from training.
[00:17:41.400 --> 00:17:45.680]   So as soon as they're born, they come sucking, right?
[00:17:45.680 --> 00:17:49.240]   So they clean up the baby, they clean the nostrils, and one of the first thing they
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:54.560]   did, they gave it to the mom, and then the baby comes out wanting to drink.
[00:17:54.560 --> 00:17:56.400]   How did he know that?
[00:17:56.400 --> 00:18:01.240]   Instinctively, the baby is born knowing how to survive.
[00:18:01.240 --> 00:18:03.240]   He needs to drink.
[00:18:03.240 --> 00:18:09.040]   And so he's using that as an illustration as a child, as a newborn baby, long for the
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:13.520]   pure milk because that's the way he's going to live in this world.
[00:18:13.520 --> 00:18:15.580]   Instinctively.
[00:18:15.580 --> 00:18:21.200]   He says when we are spiritually born, he said we ought to long for the milk, not just casually
[00:18:21.200 --> 00:18:22.940]   attend, right?
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:29.940]   Somebody who is satisfied with just having their number on their chest.
[00:18:29.940 --> 00:18:35.940]   Bible study is just homework because you're not eagerly trying to find who Christ is and
[00:18:35.940 --> 00:18:38.380]   to learn to apply and to win this race.
[00:18:38.380 --> 00:18:40.260]   You're just trying to appease other people.
[00:18:40.260 --> 00:18:44.740]   "Oh, this church tells me I have to do this, and this is what's expected, and other people
[00:18:44.740 --> 00:18:49.020]   are doing this, and so we're just jumping through the hoops to be able to belong in
[00:18:49.020 --> 00:18:50.380]   the community that I'm in."
[00:18:50.380 --> 00:18:53.620]   And so it's just homework.
[00:18:53.620 --> 00:18:56.020]   There's no life sustenance coming from that.
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:57.660]   There's no eager list to know.
[00:18:57.660 --> 00:18:59.740]   There's no digging in the scripture.
[00:18:59.740 --> 00:19:02.040]   There's no excitement to see what the Word of God says.
[00:19:02.040 --> 00:19:04.420]   It's just homework to be done week after week.
[00:19:04.420 --> 00:19:09.100]   So we just get it done and get it over with, and then I'm okay for the next week.
[00:19:09.100 --> 00:19:13.500]   That's an individual who just has a number plated on their chest and say, "I'm in the
[00:19:13.500 --> 00:19:14.660]   race too.
[00:19:14.660 --> 00:19:18.620]   I'm number 456777."
[00:19:18.620 --> 00:19:22.020]   He's saying, "Run to win."
[00:19:22.020 --> 00:19:26.460]   Our greatest hindrances in our walk with God is not external.
[00:19:26.460 --> 00:19:34.940]   It is the constant compromise and constant need of being entertained 24/7.
[00:19:34.940 --> 00:19:39.980]   Ephesians 5.15 says, "Therefore be careful how you walk, not as unwise men, but as wise,
[00:19:39.980 --> 00:19:46.260]   making the most of your time, because the days are evil."
[00:19:46.260 --> 00:19:48.740]   Making the most of your time.
[00:19:48.740 --> 00:19:55.140]   You know, one thing I realize is, you know, when we get older, I don't know exactly at
[00:19:55.140 --> 00:19:59.140]   what age that happens, you start having this old man's mentality.
[00:19:59.140 --> 00:20:02.740]   You know, "Oh yeah, when I was a kid, I did that.
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:06.100]   When you did it, oh, when I was in college, I used to do that."
[00:20:06.100 --> 00:20:10.980]   And you live off of the passion that you had when you were younger and thinking that all
[00:20:10.980 --> 00:20:14.260]   that God required of you, you've already done.
[00:20:14.260 --> 00:20:18.020]   Now you're just here, "I'm going to raise kids and I'm going to give my offering and
[00:20:18.020 --> 00:20:19.020]   just kind of give it in Christ."
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:22.980]   I'm just sitting in the back and you retired spiritually years ago.
[00:20:22.980 --> 00:20:26.820]   And there is that temptation when we start to get older, just look for retirement.
[00:20:26.820 --> 00:20:27.820]   I'm just going to rise and shine.
[00:20:27.820 --> 00:20:29.540]   I can't wait to get to heaven.
[00:20:29.540 --> 00:20:36.300]   Not realizing the short time that we have, this is the only time that we have to share
[00:20:36.300 --> 00:20:42.860]   the gospel with the lost, especially the people who are not Christians in our family.
[00:20:42.860 --> 00:20:47.860]   And then when we're young, we have a tendency to think we have all the time in the world.
[00:20:47.860 --> 00:20:51.700]   You know, you can waste a month, year, maybe even a decade.
[00:20:51.700 --> 00:20:52.700]   I got you.
[00:20:52.700 --> 00:20:55.920]   You got the next 10 years.
[00:20:55.920 --> 00:20:58.940]   It goes by just like that.
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:01.620]   And I know that this is a cliche.
[00:21:01.620 --> 00:21:04.880]   I know you hear that all the time, right?
[00:21:04.880 --> 00:21:08.140]   Your parents may have said that, the previous generation have said that.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:13.540]   It really is a myth that comes and it disappears.
[00:21:13.540 --> 00:21:16.360]   It just goes.
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:21.060]   In Psalm 90 verse 12, "And so teach us to number our days that we may present to you
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:22.500]   a heart of wisdom."
[00:21:22.500 --> 00:21:24.660]   You know what he's saying?
[00:21:24.660 --> 00:21:29.260]   God remind me that I'm going to die.
[00:21:29.260 --> 00:21:33.540]   Everything in this world, when we pray for people, we say, "Oh, may the Lord bless you
[00:21:33.540 --> 00:21:38.300]   and have a wonderful long life in this world."
[00:21:38.300 --> 00:21:40.420]   That's what we say when we bless others.
[00:21:40.420 --> 00:21:42.860]   May you have a long and prosperous life.
[00:21:42.860 --> 00:21:48.500]   He's saying, "Lord, help me to know that my life is short.
[00:21:48.500 --> 00:21:49.700]   Help me to number my days."
[00:21:49.700 --> 00:21:54.920]   In fact, in James 4.14, it says, "You do not know what your life is going to be like tomorrow.
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:59.740]   You are just a vapor that appears for a little while and then vanishes away."
[00:21:59.740 --> 00:22:02.580]   That's depressing.
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:05.700]   If you don't really believe in eternity, this is a depressing thing.
[00:22:05.700 --> 00:22:09.660]   To come to church to be reminded, you're going to die.
[00:22:09.660 --> 00:22:12.860]   100%.
[00:22:12.860 --> 00:22:21.380]   A few of you may have gotten COVID and a few of you got sick, but 100% you're going to
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:22.380]   die.
[00:22:22.380 --> 00:22:24.580]   God bless you.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:26.780]   Have a wonderful life.
[00:22:26.780 --> 00:22:30.740]   What a depressing thing to say if you don't understand the context in which he is saying
[00:22:30.740 --> 00:22:31.820]   this.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:38.060]   He's saying, "Help me to number my days that we may present to you a heart of wisdom, that
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:44.580]   we may have a perspective on the race that we are running, that this is going to end.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:45.780]   There is a finish line.
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.260]   Which finish line are we trying to cross?
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:52.060]   Which race are we competing in?
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:54.220]   What are the values that we are pursuing?
[00:22:54.220 --> 00:22:58.620]   Are we in the rat race in the name of Jesus?
[00:22:58.620 --> 00:23:03.380]   Are we actually running this race that is set before us by Christ?"
[00:23:03.380 --> 00:23:07.620]   That's why in numbering our days, knowing that we're just here temporarily, that we
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:12.460]   invest in eternal things, not simply the temporary things.
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.460]   We need to be wise.
[00:23:13.460 --> 00:23:22.460]   It's not saying that you can't have nice things, but in our pursuit, what do we value the most?
[00:23:22.460 --> 00:23:28.820]   Whenever we go to India, we have regulations for people.
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.780]   Because it's a very conservative culture, we have to tell the ladies, "You have to wear
[00:23:32.780 --> 00:23:34.260]   a skirt."
[00:23:34.260 --> 00:23:35.260]   I know skirts are not popular.
[00:23:35.260 --> 00:23:40.700]   I don't know how many of you are wearing skirts today, but people just don't wear skirts today.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:41.700]   It can't be a mini skirt.
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:43.940]   It has to be a skirt all the way down to your ankles.
[00:23:43.940 --> 00:23:46.580]   They can't see your feet.
[00:23:46.580 --> 00:23:49.440]   On top of that, you have to wear a scarf.
[00:23:49.440 --> 00:23:50.440]   You have to wear a scarf.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:54.220]   If you're indoors, you have to wear the scarf at all times, or they get offended.
[00:23:54.220 --> 00:23:59.460]   You can't have a one-to-one conversation with men, unless you're in a crowd.
[00:23:59.460 --> 00:24:02.020]   It's a very conservative country.
[00:24:02.020 --> 00:24:06.600]   Even for the guys, even if it's 105 degrees, I can't wear shorts.
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:10.740]   I have to wear long pants, and I have to wear conservative clothes, even if we're sweating
[00:24:10.740 --> 00:24:12.020]   it out.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:18.860]   I've never had anybody on our team say, "Well, there's nothing in the Bible that says that.
[00:24:18.860 --> 00:24:20.580]   I have freedom in Christ.
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:23.640]   I'm not going to wear this scarf."
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:25.140]   How dare they?
[00:24:25.140 --> 00:24:28.140]   Male chauvinist pigs.
[00:24:28.140 --> 00:24:29.780]   I mean, it's 105 degrees outside.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:30.780]   I'm not going to wear jeans.
[00:24:30.780 --> 00:24:32.740]   I'm not going to wear long pants.
[00:24:32.740 --> 00:24:36.660]   I've never had anybody struggle with that.
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:38.060]   They say, "Okay, what else?
[00:24:38.060 --> 00:24:39.060]   What else?"
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:41.860]   If they give you this, make sure you take it.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.340]   Don't shake your hands with your left hand.
[00:24:43.340 --> 00:24:48.180]   There's all these rules that we follow for one purpose, because we want to be effective
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:50.260]   in sharing the gospel.
[00:24:50.260 --> 00:24:54.620]   So we don't want anything that's going to hinder this race, anything that's going to
[00:24:54.620 --> 00:24:58.900]   make us ineffective, where they're going to be offended, or it's going to be awkward,
[00:24:58.900 --> 00:25:03.620]   and then cause us not to be able to share it effectively.
[00:25:03.620 --> 00:25:08.700]   For whatever the reason, when we come back home, we turn that off.
[00:25:08.700 --> 00:25:12.580]   And the common question is, "Well, where did the Bible say that?"
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:17.620]   So all of a sudden, our standard of what we choose is right and wrong, all of a sudden
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:22.140]   it gets turned on and turned off when we come home.
[00:25:22.140 --> 00:25:24.500]   Why is that?
[00:25:24.500 --> 00:25:28.100]   It's because when we are going out to India, we have a wartime mentality.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:30.640]   We're going into a fight.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.220]   We're going into war to bring people to Christ, and whatever is going to hinder that, we're
[00:25:35.220 --> 00:25:36.220]   willing to give up.
[00:25:36.220 --> 00:25:42.740]   Any encumbrance, anything that I do or say that's going to be offensive to somebody there
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:48.020]   that I want to share the gospel, and so he raises the standard so that there will be
[00:25:48.020 --> 00:25:49.020]   no encumbrance.
[00:25:49.020 --> 00:25:52.900]   But for whatever the reason, when we come home, we're not struggling in this battle
[00:25:52.900 --> 00:25:53.900]   anymore.
[00:25:53.900 --> 00:25:56.140]   I'm free.
[00:25:56.140 --> 00:25:57.780]   He died for us so that I can have liberty.
[00:25:57.780 --> 00:25:59.060]   I have the freedom.
[00:25:59.060 --> 00:26:03.700]   And all of a sudden, my freedom supersedes anything else.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:04.900]   Don't judge me.
[00:26:04.900 --> 00:26:09.140]   If you're in a position constantly saying, "Well, they're judging me, they're judging
[00:26:09.140 --> 00:26:14.340]   me," my guess is they're judging you for a reason.
[00:26:14.340 --> 00:26:15.340]   That's my guess.
[00:26:15.340 --> 00:26:16.740]   I could be wrong.
[00:26:16.740 --> 00:26:18.740]   Probably not.
[00:26:18.740 --> 00:26:23.020]   If you're in a habit, if your life is constantly, "They're judging me, they're judging me,"
[00:26:23.020 --> 00:26:26.940]   at least take a step back and ask yourself, what is it that you're doing that's causing
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:30.020]   them to judge you?
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:32.140]   What is it that you're ... How are you running this race?
[00:26:32.140 --> 00:26:35.920]   How are you living this life that makes it seem like you're not that interested?
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.800]   You can't have a chicken suit running this race and then say, "Hey, I don't know if that's
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:41.800]   going to be helpful.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:44.320]   Don't judge me.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:47.920]   I don't know if you should be wearing high heels.
[00:26:47.920 --> 00:26:50.240]   Where does it say?
[00:26:50.240 --> 00:26:51.640]   Where does it say I can't wear heels?
[00:26:51.640 --> 00:26:53.720]   There's no law on that."
[00:26:53.720 --> 00:26:57.520]   But clearly, you're not that serious about running this race.
[00:26:57.520 --> 00:27:02.000]   So he said, first and foremost, he says he's not to examine the sins, but examine every
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:08.200]   encumbrance that gets in our way to run this race with endurance, to make sure that we're
[00:27:08.200 --> 00:27:09.680]   running the right race.
[00:27:09.680 --> 00:27:12.560]   We're running it to win, not just casually have signed up.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:15.880]   Secondly, he says to throw off the sin.
[00:27:15.880 --> 00:27:16.880]   Throw it off.
[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880]   He's not checking away.
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:23.600]   He says, "Throw it off, every sin that's so easily entangled."
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:29.880]   These are sins that are constantly stumbling us, repeatedly, over and over again.
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.320]   Easily entangles.
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:37.440]   Those sins that are constantly near, coveting.
[00:27:37.440 --> 00:27:43.320]   The thing that we struggle with, especially us being a young church, is that pornography
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:55.000]   has become so prevalent and almost even acceptable because it's spoken of so freely in the media.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.400]   So if you don't watch porn, you're weird.
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:28:00.120]   Before it was like, "Oh, you're a virgin?
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.160]   You're 20 years old and you're a virgin?"
[00:28:02.160 --> 00:28:03.240]   Now it's like, "What?
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:04.240]   You don't watch porn?
[00:28:04.240 --> 00:28:05.240]   What's wrong with you?
[00:28:05.240 --> 00:28:06.240]   You prude."
[00:28:06.240 --> 00:28:13.280]   So it's almost weird for people not to be watching porn if you are in a secular arena
[00:28:13.280 --> 00:28:14.280]   in any way.
[00:28:14.280 --> 00:28:18.360]   And that's kind of slowly crept into the church where it's become an acceptable sin.
[00:28:18.360 --> 00:28:19.360]   "Oh, everybody sins.
[00:28:19.360 --> 00:28:20.360]   Oh, struggle."
[00:28:20.360 --> 00:28:24.360]   Where I think in the previous generation, when we said we were struggling, we just meant
[00:28:24.360 --> 00:28:27.880]   that we had impure thoughts, that we struggle.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:31.640]   Especially something that we saw years ago is kind of being replayed in our head.
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:37.680]   Today when young people say they're struggling, they're in porn, in hard porn, day to day,
[00:28:37.680 --> 00:28:40.520]   and say, "Oh, I'm just struggling."
[00:28:40.520 --> 00:28:43.120]   If that's a pattern in your life, you're not struggling.
[00:28:43.120 --> 00:28:45.680]   You've given in.
[00:28:45.680 --> 00:28:47.520]   Struggling is trying to get out.
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:52.000]   Struggling is working and confessing and laboring, asking for accountability.
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:53.320]   That's struggling.
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:58.280]   If you've accepted a certain amount of pornography in your life, you're not struggling.
[00:28:58.280 --> 00:28:59.840]   You've accepted it.
[00:28:59.840 --> 00:29:01.000]   You've allowed it.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:02.480]   You're okay with it.
[00:29:02.480 --> 00:29:04.740]   You've justified it.
[00:29:04.740 --> 00:29:09.200]   He says, "Every sin that so easily entangles."
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:11.660]   But again, our struggle isn't just porn.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.700]   Even though porn is an issue, before it was just, for the most part, it was men, but now
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:20.000]   even women are struggling with it because it's in our pockets.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:25.480]   And I thank God that I wasn't a teenager in this period.
[00:29:25.480 --> 00:29:27.200]   And we pray for you guys.
[00:29:27.200 --> 00:29:30.480]   And again, this is not just for young people, but especially for younger ones.
[00:29:30.480 --> 00:29:35.800]   The fact that you have access to anything that you want on this phone at any time, the
[00:29:35.800 --> 00:29:39.000]   temptation that you guys are in, are intense.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:43.360]   This is not something that you can conquer just by saying, "Oh, I'm struggling."
[00:29:43.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   And then next week you come, "I'm struggling."
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:47.280]   A week after that, "I'm struggling."
[00:29:47.280 --> 00:29:51.640]   Well, after about a month of that, you're not struggling.
[00:29:51.640 --> 00:29:52.640]   You've accepted it.
[00:29:52.640 --> 00:29:56.560]   You've allowed a certain amount of it in your life and you're okay with it.
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.000]   He says to struggle, but it's not just porn.
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:05.960]   You're looking at Facebook and Instagram and TikTok and whatever else is out there, and
[00:30:05.960 --> 00:30:11.200]   they're constantly presenting the perfect life, the rat race.
[00:30:11.200 --> 00:30:15.080]   Where before we would hear about it or we go to someone else's house and we see it,
[00:30:15.080 --> 00:30:16.760]   but now it's on your phone constantly.
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:18.640]   "Oh, I want to eat that."
[00:30:18.640 --> 00:30:20.240]   "Oh, I want to have that."
[00:30:20.240 --> 00:30:21.880]   "Oh, I want to go there."
[00:30:21.880 --> 00:30:23.440]   "Oh, I want to have this."
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   "I want to buy this."
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:27.840]   When is Disneyland opening?
[00:30:27.840 --> 00:30:30.760]   Constantly.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:38.080]   The constant things that distract us get our minds off of Christ so that there is no longer
[00:30:38.080 --> 00:30:40.120]   any appetite for Christ.
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:42.400]   And so we covet in our hearts.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:44.360]   And we're living every day coveting.
[00:30:44.360 --> 00:30:46.080]   "Oh, I'm going to get this.
[00:30:46.080 --> 00:30:47.560]   If I save enough money, I'm going to get this.
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:48.880]   Oh, if I save money, I'm going to do this.
[00:30:48.880 --> 00:30:50.120]   I'm going to go here."
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:55.800]   And so what has filled our hearts is constant coveting that we've allowed.
[00:30:55.800 --> 00:31:01.040]   We've allowed day to day, every single day, so that our mind is no longer consumed with
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.600]   the things of God, but they're consumed with this rat race.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:08.680]   This bucket list that we've made that has nothing to do with Christ.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:12.120]   The sin that so easily entangles.
[00:31:12.120 --> 00:31:18.800]   In Psalm 139, 23, 24, "Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:23.320]   Try me and know my anxious thoughts, and see if there be any hurtful way in me, and lead
[00:31:23.320 --> 00:31:25.920]   me in the everlasting way."
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.800]   You see, this prayer is not enough.
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:34.040]   If you are a religious person, and you have the right number, and you happen to be a little
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.440]   bit ahead of other people, that's enough.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:40.960]   And you spend the rest of the time ridiculing the people who aren't running as fast as you.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.800]   You may have the chicken suit on yourself, but your whole focus is not to win this race,
[00:31:45.800 --> 00:31:48.040]   but your whole focus is, "I'm better.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:51.160]   I'm running faster than you."
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:54.880]   But you're not carefully searching your own heart.
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:58.440]   As long as you're doing Bible study, as long as you're tithing, as long as you're active,
[00:31:58.440 --> 00:32:04.320]   but in your heart, there's judgmentalism, there's bitterness, there's slander.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.320]   And we're not aware of that.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:11.040]   Other people's sin is a stink, but the odor that's near us, we've just kind of gotten
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:12.640]   used to it, and we think it's okay.
[00:32:12.640 --> 00:32:17.720]   See, the psalmist comes before and says, "Search me."
[00:32:17.720 --> 00:32:20.880]   The Word of God judged the thoughts and intentions of my heart.
[00:32:20.880 --> 00:32:22.440]   It's not given to us.
[00:32:22.440 --> 00:32:25.320]   It's like, "Hey, I got these verses that you need."
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.160]   I did this Bible study, and you need these.
[00:32:27.160 --> 00:32:30.680]   Oh, man, this would be a great sermon for that guy to hear.
[00:32:30.680 --> 00:32:34.200]   "Search me, O God, and know my heart.
[00:32:34.200 --> 00:32:37.520]   Try me, test me, know my anxious thoughts.
[00:32:37.520 --> 00:32:44.780]   See if there's any hurtful ways in me, even my heart, my attitude."
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:48.640]   If you can put up the next slide.
[00:32:48.640 --> 00:32:50.680]   Some of you guys may have seen this before.
[00:32:50.680 --> 00:32:53.260]   Everyone has four areas of their life.
[00:32:53.260 --> 00:32:55.480]   The first area is me and others.
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:57.200]   That's your public life.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:59.280]   That's your presentation.
[00:32:59.280 --> 00:33:02.040]   They see how you look like, how you behave.
[00:33:02.040 --> 00:33:03.040]   Are you an introvert?
[00:33:03.040 --> 00:33:04.040]   Are you an extrovert?
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:07.240]   That's your public life.
[00:33:07.240 --> 00:33:13.360]   Most of us spend the most of our energy on that part because you get judged right away.
[00:33:13.360 --> 00:33:14.360]   You're a jerk.
[00:33:14.360 --> 00:33:15.360]   People say, "You're a jerk."
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.160]   You say, "Okay, maybe I shouldn't be a jerk."
[00:33:18.160 --> 00:33:20.520]   That's your public life.
[00:33:20.520 --> 00:33:23.200]   Maybe the way you talk, the way you present yourself.
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:29.680]   When we think about sanctification, that's usually where people put the most attention.
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.760]   That's why sometimes prayer life gets the back burner because we don't walk out with
[00:33:33.760 --> 00:33:37.440]   a, "I prayed this much today."
[00:33:37.440 --> 00:33:38.440]   No one sees it.
[00:33:38.440 --> 00:33:41.960]   Whether you prayed hours, two hours, or you prayed none, no one sees it.
[00:33:41.960 --> 00:33:45.640]   When you do certain things about the Bible, it's like, "Oh yeah, I did this and I did
[00:33:45.640 --> 00:33:47.480]   that."
[00:33:47.480 --> 00:33:51.960]   We have a tendency, if we're not careful, to give all our attention to that area.
[00:33:51.960 --> 00:33:56.980]   The second area is your private life, me only.
[00:33:56.980 --> 00:33:59.320]   They wouldn't know if you don't confess it.
[00:33:59.320 --> 00:34:03.520]   You could be struggling with porn, but on the outside, you're doing great.
[00:34:03.520 --> 00:34:07.440]   You're leading, you're telling, you're serving, but your private life.
[00:34:07.440 --> 00:34:11.160]   This is an area that others would not know unless you revealed it.
[00:34:11.160 --> 00:34:14.260]   You brought it to light because they don't know it's there.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:17.320]   That's why the Bible says to confess your sins to one another.
[00:34:17.320 --> 00:34:23.060]   If you're an individual who genuinely is running this race and you want to compete to win,
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:28.560]   you have to go beyond just the surface and seek accountability in areas and to confess
[00:34:28.560 --> 00:34:30.960]   your sins and, "Hey, I need help.
[00:34:30.960 --> 00:34:32.160]   I'm struggling with porn.
[00:34:32.160 --> 00:34:34.280]   Can you keep me accountable?"
[00:34:34.280 --> 00:34:36.520]   That's your private life.
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:37.880]   It doesn't have to be just with porn.
[00:34:37.880 --> 00:34:41.600]   If you're struggling with materialism, if you're struggling with competing, if you're
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:46.920]   struggling with bitterness and anger, that maybe you've done a good job to cover that
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:52.040]   up, you confess your sins and ask for accountability and run this race together.
[00:34:52.040 --> 00:34:54.960]   Third area is the others only.
[00:34:54.960 --> 00:34:56.900]   That's your blind spot.
[00:34:56.900 --> 00:35:00.520]   This is an area that others see better than you.
[00:35:00.520 --> 00:35:05.120]   This is an area that no one likes to be pointed out.
[00:35:05.120 --> 00:35:12.260]   That's why it's so hard at home because your parents probably know this really well.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:17.600]   You may have done a great job presenting on the outside, but your parents kind of like,
[00:35:17.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   "Hey, what about this?"
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.440]   It's like, "I don't want to hear it."
[00:35:21.440 --> 00:35:22.440]   Your siblings will say it.
[00:35:22.440 --> 00:35:26.120]   Then usually, they'll say it in a way that you don't like it.
[00:35:26.120 --> 00:35:30.880]   Then you come to church or a community and other people begin to kind of, "Hey, what
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:31.880]   about this?
[00:35:31.880 --> 00:35:32.880]   How about this?"
[00:35:32.880 --> 00:35:36.760]   What ends up happening, you're a Christian, so you can't say, "I hate you."
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:41.560]   You're a Christian because that will ruin your public life.
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:45.600]   What ends up doing is, "These are my acquaintances.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:46.980]   You stay where you are.
[00:35:46.980 --> 00:35:47.980]   You stay where you are.
[00:35:47.980 --> 00:35:48.980]   I don't want to be in your small group.
[00:35:48.980 --> 00:35:50.440]   I don't want to be near you.
[00:35:50.440 --> 00:35:52.920]   I don't want to go where you are.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:54.440]   Keep a distance, but I'm a Christian.
[00:35:54.440 --> 00:35:57.400]   I can't hate your guts."
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:36:01.000]   We've done that until we get married and all of a sudden, our husband starts to poke at
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:03.880]   it or your wife begins to poke at it.
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:08.560]   In the past, you just kind of shun people and kept them at a distance, but you can't
[00:36:08.560 --> 00:36:11.080]   do that anymore with your wife and husband.
[00:36:11.080 --> 00:36:12.960]   That's where the strife comes in.
[00:36:12.960 --> 00:36:17.720]   That's an area where others only ... That's your blind spot that we not only need to openly
[00:36:17.720 --> 00:36:22.640]   confess our sins, but be willing to be corrected by others when they say.
[00:36:22.640 --> 00:36:25.760]   If you are constantly saying, "Every time somebody says something you don't like, you
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.680]   say, 'Ah, stop touching me.'"
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:31.800]   Maybe you should take a step back and ask, "Why do they keep saying this?"
[00:36:31.800 --> 00:36:33.600]   Because that may be your blind spot.
[00:36:33.600 --> 00:36:40.120]   When an individual comes before God and asks, "Search me and know me," you're opening yourself
[00:36:40.120 --> 00:36:44.280]   up saying, "Lord, what is it in my life that is hindering me that maybe I know of that
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:46.020]   I'm hiding from other people?
[00:36:46.020 --> 00:36:49.040]   Maybe I don't know of that other people have been trying to tell me.
[00:36:49.040 --> 00:36:51.440]   Search me and know me.
[00:36:51.440 --> 00:36:52.440]   What are the hindrances?
[00:36:52.440 --> 00:36:55.520]   What are the sins that so easily entangles?"
[00:36:55.520 --> 00:36:57.760]   And then there's an area of our life that only God knows.
[00:36:57.760 --> 00:37:00.000]   This is our hidden life.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.080]   These are the things that we don't even know ourselves and other people don't see.
[00:37:04.080 --> 00:37:07.400]   When you get married and have children, you have no idea what kind of mother you would
[00:37:07.400 --> 00:37:08.640]   have been.
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:14.600]   So this is an area where when all four areas are exposed to God and we're asking God, "Lord,
[00:37:14.600 --> 00:37:20.880]   search me," then that's an individual who truly is trying to run this race and to win
[00:37:20.880 --> 00:37:26.200]   any encumbrance, anything, any sin that easily entangles.
[00:37:26.200 --> 00:37:31.200]   In Matthew 24, verse 7, it says, "Because lawlessness will increase, most people's love
[00:37:31.200 --> 00:37:32.200]   will grow cold."
[00:37:32.200 --> 00:37:38.680]   You ever think about why with the increase of lawlessness, most people's love grow cold?
[00:37:38.680 --> 00:37:43.040]   You would think that because of wickedness that the church would be on fire.
[00:37:43.040 --> 00:37:45.440]   But he says, "No, most will grow cold."
[00:37:45.440 --> 00:37:47.360]   Why does it grow cold?
[00:37:47.360 --> 00:37:50.320]   Because there's compromise.
[00:37:50.320 --> 00:37:55.440]   In order to have some of the world and some of God, and the more that they shift further
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:59.800]   away from God, you have to move further away from God too in order to have both or in your
[00:37:59.800 --> 00:38:00.800]   mind to have both.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:06.040]   And that's why the increase of wickedness causes the love of most people will grow cold,
[00:38:06.040 --> 00:38:11.120]   meaning most people are living compromised already.
[00:38:11.120 --> 00:38:16.240]   Most people are running the rat race and they've convinced themselves that they're not.
[00:38:16.240 --> 00:38:20.080]   That's why when the wickedness increases, we just naturally shift that direction.
[00:38:20.080 --> 00:38:22.080]   We drift toward that direction.
[00:38:22.080 --> 00:38:29.260]   First Timothy 1, 18-19, Paul tells Timothy, "I entrust to you, Timothy, my son, in accordance
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:36.440]   with the prophecies previously made concern you that by them you fight the good fight."
[00:38:36.440 --> 00:38:38.680]   He calls them to fight.
[00:38:38.680 --> 00:38:45.200]   Let me ask you, would you say you're fighting for your faith?
[00:38:45.200 --> 00:38:47.020]   Or did you just sign up?
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.180]   You just happen to be on this boat that's coasting somewhere.
[00:38:50.180 --> 00:38:52.360]   What are you fighting for?
[00:38:52.360 --> 00:38:55.100]   Are you fighting to make the right investment?
[00:38:55.100 --> 00:38:58.720]   Are you fighting so that your children will be healthy and wealthy?
[00:38:58.720 --> 00:39:00.840]   Are you fighting to have better retirement?
[00:39:00.840 --> 00:39:03.720]   What are you fighting for?
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:06.900]   Are we genuinely fighting?
[00:39:06.900 --> 00:39:10.400]   You know, when it says in Matthew 18, 8-9, I'm not going to read it for you, but in that
[00:39:10.400 --> 00:39:16.940]   passage where it says, "If your arm causes you to sin, cut it off.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:20.800]   If your eyes causes you to continue to stumble, gouge it out."
[00:39:20.800 --> 00:39:22.920]   I mean, wow, that's pretty violent.
[00:39:22.920 --> 00:39:24.520]   That's pretty gruesome.
[00:39:24.520 --> 00:39:29.080]   The point that Jesus was trying to make is that's how much he hates sin.
[00:39:29.080 --> 00:39:30.240]   That's how much he hates sin.
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:35.840]   God did not hate sin in the Old Testament and was fine with it in the New Testament.
[00:39:35.840 --> 00:39:39.240]   In fact, there's more required in the New Testament because we've been given more in
[00:39:39.240 --> 00:39:42.120]   the New Testament than the Old Testament since.
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.640]   Because now we see clearly what Christ has done.
[00:39:44.640 --> 00:39:47.460]   Knowing everything that we know and we say, "Ah, okay, whatever."
[00:39:47.460 --> 00:39:55.940]   Every once in a while, we'll talk to a young guy who's struggling with porn and say, "Hey,
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.020]   why don't we put Covenant Eyes on?"
[00:40:00.020 --> 00:40:01.620]   So you guys know who Covenant Eyes is.
[00:40:01.620 --> 00:40:05.380]   You put it on the computer and it kind of keeps each other accountable and shows other
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.300]   people what they're watching.
[00:40:08.300 --> 00:40:13.260]   Every once in a while, we'll get the answer, "I don't want that because it slows down my
[00:40:13.260 --> 00:40:16.860]   computer."
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:23.060]   So this sin of pornography is acceptable, but a slow computer is not.
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.220]   You're not serious.
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:32.260]   So what you mean is you want to conquer this sin, the easiest path possible with the least
[00:40:32.260 --> 00:40:38.540]   sacrifice, enjoying everything that I enjoy, and I want this gone too.
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:40.520]   It doesn't exist.
[00:40:40.520 --> 00:40:43.500]   It does not exist.
[00:40:43.500 --> 00:40:50.940]   That statement in and of itself is like, "Fast computers are more important to me than purity.
[00:40:50.940 --> 00:40:55.220]   Having easy access to everything that I need on the internet is more important to me than
[00:40:55.220 --> 00:40:57.340]   my walk with God."
[00:40:57.340 --> 00:41:02.980]   And that's why he says, "If these sins cause you to continually, repeatedly sin," he says,
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:06.740]   "we need to struggle even to the point of shedding blood."
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.580]   That's what he says in Hebrews chapter 12, verse 4.
[00:41:10.580 --> 00:41:15.100]   You have not yet resisted to the point of shedding blood in your striving against sin,
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:18.100]   and you have forgotten the exhortation which is addressed to you as sons.
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:22.760]   My son, do not regard lightly the discipline of the Lord, nor faith when you are reproved
[00:41:22.760 --> 00:41:23.760]   by him.
[00:41:23.760 --> 00:41:29.000]   For those whom the Lord loves, he disciplines, and he scourges every son whom he receives.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:35.260]   If you are allowing this sin to easily entangle and exist in your life, you are doing two
[00:41:35.260 --> 00:41:36.260]   things.
[00:41:36.260 --> 00:41:42.060]   Either you are waiting for the discipline of God to come.
[00:41:42.060 --> 00:41:47.380]   You are allowing sin where, because of the love of Christ, discipline will come.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:50.700]   Or you're proving that you don't believe to begin with.
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:53.660]   So it doesn't matter.
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.400]   Even if I live in sin, what matters is what you think of me.
[00:41:56.400 --> 00:41:58.540]   What matters is where I belong in this community.
[00:41:58.540 --> 00:42:02.340]   What matters is that I feel a sense of safety.
[00:42:02.340 --> 00:42:04.860]   But what God thinks doesn't matter.
[00:42:04.860 --> 00:42:07.260]   Because I don't really believe.
[00:42:07.260 --> 00:42:09.520]   So it's either one or the other.
[00:42:09.520 --> 00:42:14.540]   And either place is not safe.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:19.300]   Every sin that we are so easily entangled with.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:24.380]   In Matthew chapter 6, 11-13, I want you to pay very close attention to this Lord's prayer
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:29.740]   that we all know, and many of you have memorized, and you may not have really understood what
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:31.900]   you are saying.
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:35.220]   He says give us this day our daily bread.
[00:42:35.220 --> 00:42:36.220]   Give us this day our daily bread.
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.940]   Meaning I'm going to depend on you.
[00:42:38.940 --> 00:42:41.980]   Don't give me wealth so I can have abundance in my bank account.
[00:42:41.980 --> 00:42:45.220]   Give me this day our daily bread.
[00:42:45.220 --> 00:42:47.660]   When you are praying that, you are not praying for wealth.
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:49.500]   You are not praying for safety.
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:50.500]   You are not praying for comfort.
[00:42:50.500 --> 00:42:52.980]   You are not praying for retirement.
[00:42:52.980 --> 00:43:00.020]   You are praying that you would have just enough that you would depend on him daily.
[00:43:00.020 --> 00:43:04.020]   So you weren't praying for long, safe life.
[00:43:04.020 --> 00:43:07.700]   Give me this day our daily bread.
[00:43:07.700 --> 00:43:10.940]   You sure you want to pray that prayer?
[00:43:10.940 --> 00:43:16.140]   And forgive us our debts as we have forgiven our debtors.
[00:43:16.140 --> 00:43:17.140]   As we have forgiven our debtors.
[00:43:17.140 --> 00:43:22.820]   If we refuse to forgive other people, and then you say, Lord, forgive me of my sins,
[00:43:22.820 --> 00:43:25.900]   but punish them for their sins.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:27.500]   You can't pray that prayer.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:28.700]   You can't.
[00:43:28.700 --> 00:43:36.260]   He says when you come before God asking for forgiveness, he says as I have forgiven them.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:41.740]   So you can't ask for forgiveness if you are unwilling to forgive.
[00:43:41.740 --> 00:43:44.340]   Did you know that you were praying that?
[00:43:44.340 --> 00:43:46.500]   Here's a third.
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:51.380]   Do not lead us into temptation but deliver us from evil.
[00:43:51.380 --> 00:43:57.580]   You notice here he says, he doesn't simply say deliver us from sin.
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:00.020]   Deliver us from temptation.
[00:44:00.020 --> 00:44:04.060]   Deliver us from anything that is going to tempt me away from you.
[00:44:04.060 --> 00:44:07.460]   So you know when you pray that prayer, you know what you are asking?
[00:44:07.460 --> 00:44:16.100]   If this girl, if this guy is going to tempt me away from you, deliver me.
[00:44:16.100 --> 00:44:18.580]   Take me away from this.
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:24.660]   If this business is going to make you a lot of money, it's going to tempt you away from
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:28.220]   Christ, you are asking God to deliver you.
[00:44:28.220 --> 00:44:30.940]   Take that money away from me.
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:35.060]   If this house that you are going to buy is going to tempt you away where your heart is
[00:44:35.060 --> 00:44:40.500]   going to be filled with desires that have nothing to do with Christ, this Lord's prayer
[00:44:40.500 --> 00:44:44.340]   is asking, Lord, take that away from me.
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:45.580]   Take that away from me.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:47.780]   Deliver me from temptation.
[00:44:47.780 --> 00:44:50.160]   Lead me not into temptation.
[00:44:50.160 --> 00:44:55.580]   So when you are asking this prayer, you are praying that your primary thing that you desire
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:45:02.300]   more than anything else is to depend on him, to practice forgiveness, and to take off all
[00:45:02.300 --> 00:45:09.500]   encumbrance and all sin that entangles.
[00:45:09.500 --> 00:45:12.900]   Did you know that you were praying that?
[00:45:12.900 --> 00:45:18.180]   Did you know that you were praying that you may be praying for poverty?
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:24.380]   You may be praying for sickness because maybe your health is causing you to be proud?
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:28.220]   Maybe your fat bank account and your nice life is causing your heart to draw away from
[00:45:28.220 --> 00:45:29.220]   Christ?
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:32.760]   And so you are praying, deliver me from this temptation.
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:37.660]   Whatever temptation that you allow in your life that causes you to have your heart be
[00:45:37.660 --> 00:45:43.240]   hardened, Lord, deliver me from this.
[00:45:43.240 --> 00:45:49.040]   If you are not running the race that is before us, you do not want to pray this prayer because
[00:45:49.040 --> 00:45:51.960]   you don't want God to answer this prayer.
[00:45:51.960 --> 00:45:57.640]   You can only pray this prayer if you actually mean it, if you are running this race.
[00:45:57.640 --> 00:46:07.360]   There is a story of a man who was struggling with purity and he decided to go to a bar
[00:46:07.360 --> 00:46:10.620]   where he knew that he was going to be solicited by prostitutes and he was sitting there by
[00:46:10.620 --> 00:46:14.760]   himself and a lady taps him on the shoulder, soliciting him, turns around and she is not
[00:46:14.760 --> 00:46:17.020]   very attractive.
[00:46:17.020 --> 00:46:20.520]   So he turns around and prays, Lord, deliver me from this evil.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:22.520]   So she disappears.
[00:46:22.520 --> 00:46:26.600]   Second one comes, taps him on the shoulder and soliciting him, he turns around and she
[00:46:26.600 --> 00:46:29.200]   is very attractive.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:35.200]   But this time he turns around and says, Lord, let your will be done.
[00:46:35.200 --> 00:46:38.920]   He is already compromised when he went there.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:42.960]   He is already determined in his heart that that is what he wants.
[00:46:42.960 --> 00:46:50.000]   So many of us live in this juxtaposition of I want it all, I am going to have it all,
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:55.880]   I am going to keep it all, and I am going to go after all, but the Lord deliver me from
[00:46:55.880 --> 00:46:57.600]   this evil.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:00.760]   Let your will be done.
[00:47:00.760 --> 00:47:05.840]   I want to be pure but I don't want to have a slow computer.
[00:47:05.840 --> 00:47:11.280]   I want to honor Christ and I want to live all for Christ but Lord protect all that I
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:12.280]   have.
[00:47:12.280 --> 00:47:16.000]   Protect all that I have, all my children, everything that I have, that it would be under
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.160]   your umbrella of blessing.
[00:47:19.160 --> 00:47:24.760]   When he says every encumbrance, every sin that easily entangles, the standard that we
[00:47:24.760 --> 00:47:27.620]   ought to be asking is are we committed to this?
[00:47:27.620 --> 00:47:29.600]   What fight are we fighting?
[00:47:29.600 --> 00:47:35.400]   And part of the reason why people don't ask and they don't have a problem going to India
[00:47:35.400 --> 00:47:41.040]   and giving it all up is because they recognize that we are in a battle.
[00:47:41.040 --> 00:47:46.320]   Soldiers who are going into battle are not worried about the fluffiness of their pillow.
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:52.520]   Because the only single-minded focus is, is this going to help me in this battle?
[00:47:52.520 --> 00:47:55.640]   Or is this going to hinder me in this battle?
[00:47:55.640 --> 00:47:57.200]   And so that's what he is calling us to.
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:48:01.960]   It's because they were drifting back to a civilian life and that's why he tells Paul,
[00:48:01.960 --> 00:48:11.240]   Paul tells Timothy, right, to run in such a way, not to live like a civilian, as a good
[00:48:11.240 --> 00:48:15.700]   soldier of Christ, to persevere.
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:19.840]   So let me finish with this in Psalm 119 verse 9 through 11, it says, "How can a young man
[00:48:19.840 --> 00:48:21.840]   keep his way pure?
[00:48:21.840 --> 00:48:28.680]   By keeping it according to your word, with all my heart I have sought you.
[00:48:28.680 --> 00:48:30.580]   Do not let me wander from your commandments.
[00:48:30.580 --> 00:48:36.200]   Your word I have treasured in my heart that I may not sin against you."
[00:48:36.200 --> 00:48:41.720]   Is that, can you say that that's your prayer?
[00:48:41.720 --> 00:48:45.140]   With all my heart I have sought you.
[00:48:45.140 --> 00:48:50.120]   The problem, again, the temptation, the struggle that you and I have in this, where we live,
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:55.560]   yeah, we're seeking God, but not with all our heart.
[00:48:55.560 --> 00:48:59.400]   We pray, but not with urgency.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:04.260]   We share the gospel, but we're not desperate.
[00:49:04.260 --> 00:49:06.760]   We're just doing it.
[00:49:06.760 --> 00:49:13.360]   There's a difference if you've raised children, when a child wants his mom or dad, you know,
[00:49:13.360 --> 00:49:17.040]   you ever get on the airplane and this child is like, "Mommy!"
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:20.520]   And then the parents just kind of shut it off, right?
[00:49:20.520 --> 00:49:25.120]   And then, you know, if you don't have kids, you kind of like, you know, you get very impatient,
[00:49:25.120 --> 00:49:27.160]   "What's wrong with these parents?
[00:49:27.160 --> 00:49:29.200]   Shut that kid up!"
[00:49:29.200 --> 00:49:35.280]   But the parents have a tendency, have a way, there's a mechanism to turn that off, because
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.440]   they can't survive.
[00:49:37.440 --> 00:49:42.760]   Because if you have even one child, or maybe you have five children or six, and they all
[00:49:42.760 --> 00:49:48.200]   go through a stage where they're like, "Mommy, mommy."
[00:49:48.200 --> 00:49:49.680]   They want your attention constantly.
[00:49:49.680 --> 00:49:53.720]   You know, I drop my Cheerios, "Mommy, my Cheerios."
[00:49:53.720 --> 00:50:00.720]   You know, "My brother took the bigger spoon, I wanted the bigger spoon."
[00:50:00.720 --> 00:50:06.360]   You know, "He took more vanilla, I wanted vanilla, he took the chocolate, mommy."
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:13.000]   So because you hear that 24/7, you recognize what needs your attention and what doesn't
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:15.960]   need your attention, right?
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:22.360]   So you have to learn to shut that off, because you can't be jumping every time, "Oh, man,
[00:50:22.360 --> 00:50:27.360]   I wanted to use that chopstick, he got my chopstick."
[00:50:27.360 --> 00:50:33.600]   You just can't turn it off, you just go do your business, right?
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:40.680]   But there's a kind of cry that your child cries that even if it's three in the morning,
[00:50:40.680 --> 00:50:46.560]   you know this is not a dribble, this is not casual.
[00:50:46.560 --> 00:50:53.760]   "Mommy, daddy."
[00:50:53.760 --> 00:51:00.040]   Even if it's three in the morning, even if you're sick, even if you didn't sleep at all,
[00:51:00.040 --> 00:51:08.640]   when you hear that cry, you jump and you pay attention, because you know they need you.
[00:51:08.640 --> 00:51:24.480]   In the way that we live our lives, we may be, "God, there's a house again, and a house."
[00:51:24.480 --> 00:51:27.560]   And say, "Oh, God doesn't answer our prayer."
[00:51:27.560 --> 00:51:32.240]   Maybe that prayer doesn't need to be answered, because I don't think you really care.
[00:51:32.240 --> 00:51:38.480]   We haven't decided in our heart, we haven't decided to follow Christ.
[00:51:38.480 --> 00:51:43.560]   We've decided to be in the race, we've decided not to be judged, but we haven't decided to
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:46.200]   run this race to win.
[00:51:46.200 --> 00:51:53.240]   That's why if you're an individual who's not fighting to finish the race, anybody who's
[00:51:53.240 --> 00:51:59.680]   a cheerleader is like annoying, because you're just trying to relax, you're just trying to
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:01.680]   watch a movie.
[00:52:01.680 --> 00:52:08.440]   And then you hear somebody say, "Let's go, let's go one more mile, you're almost there."
[00:52:08.440 --> 00:52:09.440]   "Let's go."
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:12.440]   "Don't do that, don't stop for that."
[00:52:12.440 --> 00:52:16.440]   "Put on the right shoes, get in the work."
[00:52:16.440 --> 00:52:20.880]   And so if you're committed to this race, you want a cheerleader, you want somebody to pump
[00:52:20.880 --> 00:52:23.080]   some energy into you to go.
[00:52:23.080 --> 00:52:28.600]   But if that's not you, you're just kind of like casually just like, "Come on, calm down."
[00:52:28.600 --> 00:52:31.360]   Dim the lights a little bit.
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:33.400]   Like lower your voice.
[00:52:33.400 --> 00:52:35.960]   What's so important?
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:43.760]   Even the way you listen to sermons is different, depending on which race you're committed to.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:47.420]   If you're running to win, fellowship looks different.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:50.600]   Your prayer life will look different.
[00:52:50.600 --> 00:52:53.640]   Your Bible studies will look different.
[00:52:53.640 --> 00:52:56.520]   Your evangelism will look different.
[00:52:56.520 --> 00:53:02.400]   But first and foremost, we have to decide, which race are we running?
[00:53:02.400 --> 00:53:04.320]   Are we in the rat race?
[00:53:04.320 --> 00:53:08.360]   Are we committed to the race that He has set before us?
[00:53:08.360 --> 00:53:08.600]   Let's pray.
[00:53:08.600 --> 00:53:18.600]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
