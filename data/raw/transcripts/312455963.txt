[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.560]   Alright, so you should have gotten a sheet from me.
[00:00:06.560 --> 00:00:11.960]   So there isn't going to be a sheet for you every single week, but the weeks that, obviously
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:15.200]   I'm going to give it to you, you'll have that, you have it for today.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:23.680]   Every week I'm going to give you some input on hermeneutic principles.
[00:00:23.680 --> 00:00:28.360]   So as we're studying it, we're going to go over certain hermeneutical principles on how
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:32.000]   you ought to study the Bible, instead of giving it to you all at once, we're going to review
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:34.760]   it as we're going.
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:44.920]   So to start, do I need to stand aside a little bit?
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:56.440]   Alright, so first thing, when we're studying the Bible, again, as I mentioned before, the
[00:00:56.440 --> 00:01:02.000]   goal of this study is to get you to learn how to do inductive Bible study, not to simply
[00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.280]   come here and take notes.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:08.240]   So interpreting a passage in harmony with its context, we talked about that last week,
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:09.740]   the context.
[00:01:09.740 --> 00:01:13.360]   If you take it out of the context, that's where bad doctrines come from.
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:19.280]   So a lot of times, if you've ever had a discussion with a Jehovah's Witness about heaven, about
[00:01:19.280 --> 00:01:24.880]   salvation, about the identity of Christ, they'll spit Bible verses at you, and if you don't
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:28.160]   know the context, it sounds very biblical.
[00:01:28.160 --> 00:01:31.680]   But once you actually go to the text that they're quoting, you're going to see it has
[00:01:31.680 --> 00:01:35.960]   nothing to do with what the author intended.
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:38.480]   So that's where bad doctrine comes from.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:40.080]   So you have to understand the context.
[00:01:40.080 --> 00:01:43.040]   So interpret a passage in harmony with the context.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.940]   There's a logical connection from one section of the scripture to the next, just like if
[00:01:46.940 --> 00:01:50.440]   you're reading any letter, you wouldn't start in the middle, you wouldn't start at the end,
[00:01:50.440 --> 00:01:52.200]   you would read it consecutively.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.760]   So you must try to find the overall purpose of the book in order to determine the meaning
[00:01:55.760 --> 00:01:58.300]   of the particular words or passages in the book.
[00:01:58.300 --> 00:02:04.160]   So one of the first things I ask you to do is to know the four chapters.
[00:02:04.160 --> 00:02:07.340]   I'm assuming 100% of you did that before you came.
[00:02:07.340 --> 00:02:10.660]   I'm assuming that.
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:15.520]   You have to understand what he says in the whole letter in order for us to go back into
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:21.080]   verses three to eight, and where does this fit in into his larger letter.
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:25.120]   So you don't want to just go in there and then interpret a particular verse or a word
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:29.200]   outside of the larger context of what he's trying to say.
[00:02:29.200 --> 00:02:30.320]   You understand?
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:34.440]   So that's why I asked you, like we outlined chapter one, to take some time to outline
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:35.680]   chapter two, three, and four.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:40.480]   So if you haven't done that, I want to encourage you as a homework to go back this week and
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   outline the text.
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.320]   I'm going to give you the general outline for the sake of time, but that's not enough.
[00:02:46.320 --> 00:02:47.420]   You need to know the outline.
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:51.020]   You can't just take an outline that I give you and say, "Oh, that's what it says."
[00:02:51.020 --> 00:02:54.920]   It's a world of difference in the way that you're going to understand the text if you
[00:02:54.920 --> 00:02:59.720]   already know what he is saying instead of just regurgitating what I'm saying.
[00:02:59.720 --> 00:03:04.380]   So each word must be understood within the context of the verse.
[00:03:04.380 --> 00:03:13.820]   So if you interpret love, servant, grace, outside of the context of what Paul meant
[00:03:13.820 --> 00:03:18.280]   and what he meant within the context of that letter and that verse, again, that's where
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:19.920]   misinterpretation comes in.
[00:03:19.920 --> 00:03:24.420]   Each verse must be understood within the context of the paragraph.
[00:03:24.420 --> 00:03:28.300]   So you need to know the word in the context of the verse, the verse in the context of
[00:03:28.300 --> 00:03:32.260]   the paragraph, paragraph in the context of the chapter.
[00:03:32.260 --> 00:03:37.960]   So verses three to eight that we're looking at, Paul is giving thanks in his introduction,
[00:03:37.960 --> 00:03:39.480]   and then he's talking about prayer.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.200]   Where does this fit in, into the larger context?
[00:03:42.200 --> 00:03:48.220]   And then each chapter must be understood within the context of the book, this letter.
[00:03:48.220 --> 00:03:53.880]   So what is Paul's main point in Colossians?
[00:03:53.880 --> 00:03:57.340]   Don't look at your Bibles, but based upon what you've read and the outline that you
[00:03:57.340 --> 00:04:03.340]   give, if you were to give like one sentence statement of why Paul wrote this letter, what
[00:04:03.340 --> 00:04:08.600]   is the main thrust of this letter, what would you say?
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:19.440]   Please yell it out if you have an opinion on that.
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:20.440]   Okay.
[00:04:20.440 --> 00:04:21.440]   Yes.
[00:04:21.440 --> 00:04:22.440]   Okay.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   So the centrality of Christ to the Christian faith.
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:28.960]   So if you have anything similar to that, that's probably, if you've read through it and outlined
[00:04:28.960 --> 00:04:35.040]   it, that's probably the essential theme that is connecting all these thoughts together.
[00:04:35.040 --> 00:04:36.040]   Okay?
[00:04:36.040 --> 00:04:37.040]   So the centrality of Christ.
[00:04:37.040 --> 00:04:42.960]   So if you want to learn about Christology, the identity of Christ, what he did in redemption,
[00:04:42.960 --> 00:04:49.520]   where he stands before the Father, where does he stand in context of creation, all of that
[00:04:49.520 --> 00:04:50.520]   is in Colossians.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:53.600]   So Colossians is heavy in Christology.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:56.560]   What's another book that's really heavy in Christology?
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:04:59.640]   Galatians, Hebrews.
[00:04:59.640 --> 00:05:03.040]   Hebrews is another book that's very heavy in Christology.
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:09.440]   So Colossians in Paul's epistles is probably the heaviest in Christology.
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:13.520]   And again, each book must be understood within the context of the whole Bible.
[00:05:13.520 --> 00:05:14.520]   In redemptive history.
[00:05:14.520 --> 00:05:16.280]   So where does this fit into redemptive history?
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:20.440]   So Paul's epistles are very easy to figure out where it fits in because he straight up
[00:05:20.440 --> 00:05:24.620]   tells you, this is the gospel, this is why Christ came.
[00:05:24.620 --> 00:05:28.000]   But there are some other letters that you might read, like those of you who are memorizing
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.520]   James.
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:33.400]   It's not as clear, so you have to ask that larger question.
[00:05:33.400 --> 00:05:37.600]   Where does James fit in into the context of the larger redemptive history?
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:39.520]   Or he's just rebuking people.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:41.400]   He's just talking about rich and poor.
[00:05:41.400 --> 00:05:45.300]   But where does that fit in into the context of the gospel ministry?
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:50.200]   So that question has to be answered before you go and interpret what he's saying in the
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:52.020]   details.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:57.640]   So that's why it's important for us to do a larger study of the book before you jump
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:00.080]   into each verse.
[00:06:00.080 --> 00:06:05.600]   So Paul's main thing is about Christology, but why does he emphasize Christology to the
[00:06:05.600 --> 00:06:06.600]   Colossians?
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:09.880]   What was happening in Colossians?
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:14.720]   Now you didn't read the commentaries, I'm just assuming you didn't, but why do you think,
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:22.760]   if you remember the outline of the letter, why does he feel the need to stress Christology
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.120]   to the Colossians?
[00:06:27.120 --> 00:06:31.680]   I mentioned this earlier, last week.
[00:06:31.680 --> 00:06:35.400]   There's two different issues that he deals with, and you see it in the letters.
[00:06:35.400 --> 00:06:38.320]   And when we get there, we'll point it out.
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:46.240]   There is an element of semi-Gnostics, who are, again, they're messing around with Jesus'
[00:06:46.240 --> 00:06:47.240]   identity.
[00:06:47.240 --> 00:06:48.680]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:06:48.680 --> 00:06:54.800]   First John deals with the Gnostics, who are saying that the flesh and the spirit is separate.
[00:06:54.800 --> 00:06:58.200]   So Christ didn't come in the flesh, and what you do in the flesh doesn't matter.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:03.160]   So there's an element of that that he's trying to correct by teaching who Jesus is.
[00:07:03.160 --> 00:07:07.200]   And then there's another element, the Judaizers.
[00:07:07.200 --> 00:07:13.580]   He talks about how these elementary things have passed away, that it no longer applies
[00:07:13.580 --> 00:07:15.200]   to us because Christ fulfilled it.
[00:07:15.200 --> 00:07:20.880]   So he's dealing with both problems, the problem that dominated the Gentile world, and then
[00:07:20.880 --> 00:07:23.400]   the problem that dominated the Jewish world.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:25.720]   So he deals with both of them, right?
[00:07:25.720 --> 00:07:32.120]   But the way he deals with it is by going back and teaching about who Jesus is and what he's
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:33.480]   done.
[00:07:33.480 --> 00:07:37.560]   So that's the overarching theme of Colossians.
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:41.000]   Can somebody tell me how Colossians is divided?
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:46.920]   Just overarching, large, not just three verses and five verses, and hopefully you did that
[00:07:46.920 --> 00:07:47.920]   as well.
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:54.920]   Just for the sake of time, what is the large divide in the book of Colossians?
[00:07:54.920 --> 00:07:57.920]   Where does that happen?
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:00.960]   Anybody?
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:04.760]   We have four chapters.
[00:08:04.760 --> 00:08:14.360]   What happens in chapter three?
[00:08:14.360 --> 00:08:16.000]   So that's the larger picture.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Hopefully you heard that.
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.600]   We have four chapters.
[00:08:18.600 --> 00:08:21.960]   First two chapters mainly deal with Christology.
[00:08:21.960 --> 00:08:26.840]   Who is Jesus, what did he do, and how did that affect us?
[00:08:26.840 --> 00:08:31.000]   If you get to chapter three, what does the first verse, first line of chapter three begin
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   with?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   "Therefore."
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.720]   In fact, he'll mention it a couple times in the beginning of chapter three.
[00:08:36.720 --> 00:08:40.940]   So he's taking all the things that he's taught about Christ, and so therefore this is how
[00:08:40.940 --> 00:08:42.060]   you ought to live.
[00:08:42.060 --> 00:08:44.440]   So that's the big divide in Colossians.
[00:08:44.440 --> 00:08:47.920]   You have doctrine versus practice.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:55.480]   In fact, large chunks of the New Testament letters are all divided that way.
[00:08:55.480 --> 00:08:59.600]   This is who he is, this is what he's done, therefore you need to do this.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:01.640]   Ephesians chapter one, two, three.
[00:09:01.640 --> 00:09:07.880]   Adoption, election, his love, therefore live up to the calling that you've received.
[00:09:07.880 --> 00:09:13.840]   And so Paul, before he gets to this is what you ought to do, he talks about why you ought
[00:09:13.840 --> 00:09:15.400]   to do it.
[00:09:15.400 --> 00:09:18.100]   So that's the large division in the book of Colossians.
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.780]   He's dealing with these two specific problems, but the way he deals with it is teaching Christ
[00:09:23.780 --> 00:09:27.380]   and then motivation to do what is right.
[00:09:27.380 --> 00:09:32.920]   So obviously the next couple months we're going to be in the first two chapters, and
[00:09:32.920 --> 00:09:36.560]   so it's going to be heavy in Christology.
[00:09:36.560 --> 00:09:40.960]   Now a lot of these things may be new to you, for a lot of you who have been a Christian
[00:09:40.960 --> 00:09:45.080]   for a while, none of these terms are going to be new.
[00:09:45.080 --> 00:09:50.200]   But what I really want to encourage you is that sometimes the things that you think you
[00:09:50.200 --> 00:09:54.700]   know are the areas that you are the most blind in.
[00:09:54.700 --> 00:09:59.560]   Because you just assume, because you hear these terms so often, if you haven't taken
[00:09:59.560 --> 00:10:05.880]   the time to ask questions and dig, you probably only have like first grade level understanding
[00:10:05.880 --> 00:10:06.880]   of that.
[00:10:06.880 --> 00:10:12.100]   And so the purpose of this inductive study is for you to go deeper.
[00:10:12.100 --> 00:10:13.680]   What did Paul mean by bond servant?
[00:10:13.680 --> 00:10:16.340]   Why does he open the letter this way in every letter?
[00:10:16.340 --> 00:10:19.480]   Why does he address him this way but not the other person that way?
[00:10:19.480 --> 00:10:25.840]   All of these things will help you to go deeper into what he means.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:32.520]   So we already went through, so the two words or phrases that are the most repeated in the
[00:10:32.520 --> 00:10:38.520]   book of Colossians, anybody have an idea?
[00:10:38.520 --> 00:10:41.760]   Jesus Christ, right?
[00:10:41.760 --> 00:10:46.320]   Next time you go through Colossians, just highlight every time it says Jesus or Christ,
[00:10:46.320 --> 00:10:49.100]   or Jesus Christ, or Christ, right?
[00:10:49.100 --> 00:10:51.880]   And it's peppered all throughout the book of Colossians.
[00:10:51.880 --> 00:10:59.800]   Or he, him, right, referring to Jesus, right, is also highlighted every year.
[00:10:59.800 --> 00:11:03.920]   So if you combine it together, the most common phrase that you will see all throughout, maybe
[00:11:03.920 --> 00:11:10.640]   like 20 to, anywhere from 20 to 30 times, it's mentioned where Jesus Christ, him, he,
[00:11:10.640 --> 00:11:13.960]   he did this, he is our redemption, over and over again.
[00:11:13.960 --> 00:11:19.480]   So just by highlighting these repeated words, you can automatically tell that that's what
[00:11:19.480 --> 00:11:22.440]   Colossians is for.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:28.920]   That's the main thrust of this letter, just by seeing the repetition.
[00:11:28.920 --> 00:11:34.080]   To give you a quick background of this letter, I'm not going to go too deep into this, but
[00:11:34.080 --> 00:11:35.260]   what is Colossians called?
[00:11:35.260 --> 00:11:39.760]   What kind of epistle is this?
[00:11:39.760 --> 00:11:51.280]   Yes, but within the epistles, there's a specific title given to four epistles.
[00:11:51.280 --> 00:11:52.480]   Prison epistle.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:55.600]   Now why is it prison epistle?
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:11:58.900]   Because he wrote it to prisoners?
[00:11:58.900 --> 00:12:04.420]   Remember at the end of the Book of Acts, Apostle Paul, remember we were studying at the very
[00:12:04.420 --> 00:12:10.040]   end, tail end of the Book of Acts, how he prayed to come to Rome and be able to be a
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:14.280]   witness and remember he ends up in Rome and he spends a couple of years there and he gets
[00:12:14.280 --> 00:12:15.720]   freedom, people come and go.
[00:12:15.720 --> 00:12:19.760]   And so during that period is when he writes this, one of the letters.
[00:12:19.760 --> 00:12:23.480]   So the four prison epistles is Philippians, Ephesians, Colossians, and what's the other
[00:12:23.480 --> 00:12:24.480]   one?
[00:12:24.480 --> 00:12:26.120]   Philemon, right?
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:30.380]   They're called the prison epistles because he writes it most likely when he was imprisoned
[00:12:30.380 --> 00:12:31.420]   in Rome.
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:33.360]   So he wasn't done because he was in prison.
[00:12:33.360 --> 00:12:37.420]   In fact, God gave him all the freedom that he needed during this period and he writes
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.540]   these four epistles.
[00:12:39.540 --> 00:12:42.820]   One of the questions that you guys asked was what's the background behind this?
[00:12:42.820 --> 00:12:52.060]   If you look at Ephesians chapter 4, 12, okay, go to Ephesians chapter 4, 12.
[00:12:52.060 --> 00:12:59.740]   Epaphras is mentioned here, right, as a bond servant, fellow faithful worker of Jesus Christ.
[00:12:59.740 --> 00:13:07.440]   But in chapter 4, 12, what does it say about Epaphras?
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.160]   Just yell it out if you're there.
[00:13:12.160 --> 00:13:14.500]   Say it.
[00:13:14.500 --> 00:13:19.800]   Chapter 4, 12, what does it say about Epaphras?
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:22.800]   I got the wrong verse?
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:23.800]   What did I say?
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:28.040]   Oh, you know what I meant.
[00:13:28.040 --> 00:13:30.440]   You guys actually went to Ephesians?
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:35.960]   We're studying Colossians, all right?
[00:13:35.960 --> 00:13:38.720]   Listen to what I mean.
[00:13:38.720 --> 00:13:42.640]   Colossians 4, 12.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:45.080]   What does it say?
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:49.040]   Epaphras is one of you, right?
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:55.320]   So Epaphras was from Colossae and so he was the carrier of the letter.
[00:13:55.320 --> 00:14:00.320]   So Paul probably heard from Epaphras what was going on in Colossae.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:04.000]   So what he says in the beginning, he probably heard from Epaphras and from other people
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:06.480]   and so he decides to write this letter.
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:11.880]   And he hears great things that are happening but he's also concerned about the false teaching
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:14.100]   that's coming into this young church.
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:19.100]   So Paul, concerned over that, knowing that Epaphras is one of his fellow workers, he
[00:14:19.100 --> 00:14:22.180]   writes this letter and Epaphras takes it over there.
[00:14:22.180 --> 00:14:26.500]   So that's the background behind this story.
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:32.300]   So the hermeneutical principle that I want you to remember, again, context, context,
[00:14:32.300 --> 00:14:34.860]   context, but this is the one that I want you to remember for today.
[00:14:34.860 --> 00:14:37.620]   Scripture must interpret scripture.
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:42.540]   So when you are interpreting something, if that passage contradicts something else in
[00:14:42.540 --> 00:14:47.460]   the scripture, you're probably interpreting it wrong.
[00:14:47.460 --> 00:14:52.540]   You have to understand that we're not studying Paul's letters and Peter's letters as if they
[00:14:52.540 --> 00:14:54.220]   are separate.
[00:14:54.220 --> 00:14:57.860]   There's only one true author, the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:15:01.380]   We're not talking to non-Christians trying to debate the authorship of the Bible.
[00:15:01.380 --> 00:15:06.520]   We're assuming that we all agree that the author is the Holy Spirit.
[00:15:06.520 --> 00:15:09.660]   So if the author is the Holy Spirit, the author is not going to say something that's going
[00:15:09.660 --> 00:15:11.880]   to contradict himself later on.
[00:15:11.880 --> 00:15:19.580]   So the one principle I want you to pay attention to is whatever insight that you have, if that
[00:15:19.580 --> 00:15:25.020]   contradicts something else that is written in other parts of scripture, you have to go
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:29.140]   back and look to make sure that you're not interpreting it wrong.
[00:15:29.140 --> 00:15:30.740]   Does that make sense?
[00:15:30.740 --> 00:15:35.100]   And that's why typically when you're doing Bible study, if you have time, you always
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.100]   cross-reference.
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:41.300]   So if there's something being said, does he say the same thing somewhere else?
[00:15:41.300 --> 00:15:43.040]   Is that same teaching somewhere else?
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:47.020]   That's why, like those of you, again, studying the book of James, right, or memorizing the
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:50.700]   book of James, it says, "Faith without deeds is dead.
[00:15:50.700 --> 00:15:54.380]   I will show you my faith by my deeds."
[00:15:54.380 --> 00:15:59.100]   And one is saved not simply by faith, but by works.
[00:15:59.100 --> 00:16:00.860]   So you've memorized that passage.
[00:16:00.860 --> 00:16:04.740]   It's like, well, James is saying that you're saved by works.
[00:16:04.740 --> 00:16:06.820]   And then Paul is saying in other parts that he says.
[00:16:06.820 --> 00:16:08.720]   So this seems to be contradicting.
[00:16:08.720 --> 00:16:17.100]   So is this contradicting or are we not understanding what he is saying?
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:21.260]   So I'm giving you an example of when you interpret scripture, you have to allow scripture to
[00:16:21.260 --> 00:16:22.260]   interpret scripture.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:23.260]   It's clear.
[00:16:23.260 --> 00:16:29.000]   I mean, you can ask Pastor Peter about the details, but James is not saying salvation
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.180]   is by works.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:34.420]   He's saying, "I will show you my faith by my works."
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:40.980]   So faith can be evidenced, is something that you can see by how somebody applies what he
[00:16:40.980 --> 00:16:41.980]   has.
[00:16:41.980 --> 00:16:46.180]   But if you say you have faith and there is no application of that, your faith is dead.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:47.180]   It's no different than demons.
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:50.260]   So he's not saying anything different than what Paul is saying.
[00:16:50.260 --> 00:16:55.200]   He's just emphasizing this is what true faith looks like, right?
[00:16:55.200 --> 00:16:58.800]   So that's an example of how scripture has to interpret scripture.
[00:16:58.800 --> 00:17:02.020]   You can't just take scripture and say, it seems to say something.
[00:17:02.020 --> 00:17:04.140]   So Paul and James contradicts each other.
[00:17:04.140 --> 00:17:06.980]   And that's bad interpretation, right?
[00:17:06.980 --> 00:17:09.300]   So scripture must interpret scripture.
[00:17:09.300 --> 00:17:11.860]   All right, now I want to get you.
[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:17.500]   So if you get to your, the handout, there's a section that I just kind of put the verses
[00:17:17.500 --> 00:17:18.500]   there.
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:23.440]   So if you are comfortable writing notes on your Bible, I encourage you to do that.
[00:17:23.440 --> 00:17:28.460]   But you know, one thing I found out is through years of jotting notes on my Bible, six, seven
[00:17:28.460 --> 00:17:32.420]   years later, I look at my notes and it's just complete nonsense.
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:37.260]   It's not nonsense, but these are things that I wouldn't need to see five years later.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:38.900]   It was exciting at that time, but later on.
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:44.720]   So I've reserved making permanent notes on my Bible on things that I know that six, seven
[00:17:44.720 --> 00:17:47.460]   years later, I'm going to look at it and say, oh, that's helpful.
[00:17:47.460 --> 00:17:48.460]   Okay.
[00:17:48.460 --> 00:17:52.260]   But I see some of your Bibles and it's like red mark, yellow mark, green mark everywhere.
[00:17:52.260 --> 00:17:56.600]   And it has no purpose.
[00:17:56.600 --> 00:17:57.620]   It's just very colorful.
[00:17:57.620 --> 00:17:58.620]   So you were excited.
[00:17:58.620 --> 00:18:02.340]   You were doing quiet time one day and you're just like, yes, this is so good.
[00:18:02.340 --> 00:18:05.700]   And then years later you were like, you completely forgot why you highlighted it.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:06.700]   Right.
[00:18:06.700 --> 00:18:09.620]   So if you're one of those people that are comfortable writing through in your Bible,
[00:18:09.620 --> 00:18:10.620]   you're welcome to do that.
[00:18:10.620 --> 00:18:13.940]   But I gave you this because I want you to take notes.
[00:18:13.940 --> 00:18:17.060]   I want you to look at the way we're looking at these things.
[00:18:17.060 --> 00:18:22.540]   So you've already done the interpretation, hopefully.
[00:18:22.540 --> 00:18:23.540]   Right.
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:28.780]   My point, the job that I'm going to do is just to kind of highlight and to show you
[00:18:28.780 --> 00:18:34.700]   some insights that I saw and it may supplement what you guys talked about, but it's not meant
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:38.540]   to replace it or for you to come and just listen to me.
[00:18:38.540 --> 00:18:39.540]   Okay.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:40.540]   So let's begin.
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:46.540]   So I look at this passage, Paul says, we give thanks.
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:47.540]   Okay.
[00:18:47.540 --> 00:18:52.740]   Again, some of the things that I'm going to highlight to you may not be significant, but
[00:18:52.740 --> 00:18:58.700]   you notice where he says we, a lot of his letter, he says I.
[00:18:58.700 --> 00:19:05.100]   But Colossians and Thessalonians, he says we, where there's an emphasis on his ministry
[00:19:05.100 --> 00:19:07.020]   versus just him as an apostle.
[00:19:07.020 --> 00:19:08.020]   Right.
[00:19:08.020 --> 00:19:12.020]   Later on, he does talk about his particular ministry as an apostle, but at least in the
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:14.420]   beginning of it, he says we.
[00:19:14.420 --> 00:19:19.620]   He gives thanks to God and then he says he prays always for them.
[00:19:19.620 --> 00:19:20.620]   Okay.
[00:19:20.620 --> 00:19:25.980]   The first thing that I asked myself is I know that this is a typical opening of a letter,
[00:19:25.980 --> 00:19:28.700]   but does Paul actually mean this?
[00:19:28.700 --> 00:19:30.140]   Right.
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:32.420]   Obviously the question, the answer has to be yes.
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:33.740]   This is the Holy Spirit.
[00:19:33.740 --> 00:19:35.460]   It's like he's not making this up.
[00:19:35.460 --> 00:19:36.460]   Right.
[00:19:36.460 --> 00:19:41.380]   And you see that oftentimes like he's, this is a church that he's never met.
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.660]   He hears about it and he says, I'm praying for you.
[00:19:43.660 --> 00:19:47.980]   And obviously Paul's sitting in prison, but consider all the letters that he wrote, consider
[00:19:47.980 --> 00:19:52.620]   all the people that he was with and then he just take time to actually pray for them and
[00:19:52.620 --> 00:19:55.980]   to be genuinely be thankful.
[00:19:55.980 --> 00:19:57.260]   Right.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:03.140]   The thought that I had was I think there is a disconnect.
[00:20:03.140 --> 00:20:07.660]   Like sometimes we get excited about what's happening in our church and then you hear
[00:20:07.660 --> 00:20:11.060]   what's happening down the street and we almost feel disconnected.
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:12.060]   Right.
[00:20:12.060 --> 00:20:17.780]   Like what we know mentally that we're all in the kingdom, we're all servants of Christ,
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:22.540]   but the way that we oftentimes function is like this is the kingdom.
[00:20:22.540 --> 00:20:23.540]   Right.
[00:20:23.540 --> 00:20:27.620]   And we don't, we don't often rejoice over what's happening in God's larger kingdom with
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.180]   other children.
[00:20:29.180 --> 00:20:32.860]   And the reason why I believe Paul is able to say this because he is so committed to
[00:20:32.860 --> 00:20:34.420]   the spreading of the gospel.
[00:20:34.420 --> 00:20:38.180]   And like he says in Philippians chapter one, some, some preach Christ out of envy, some
[00:20:38.180 --> 00:20:43.500]   preach out of rivalry, some preach Christ out of, you know, good motivation, but whatever
[00:20:43.500 --> 00:20:47.500]   it is that Christ is being preached and therefore I give thanks and rejoice.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.500]   Right.
[00:20:48.500 --> 00:20:51.460]   And so it was because Paul is that committed to spreading of the gospel.
[00:20:51.460 --> 00:20:56.380]   He wasn't committed ultimately in spreading his ministry, right?
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:20:58.380]   His brand, but at the spreading of the gospel.
[00:20:58.380 --> 00:21:03.380]   And that's something that obviously I think pastors struggle with that more than lay people
[00:21:03.380 --> 00:21:07.220]   because we're so committed to building up of bringing community church and where I'm
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.580]   committed to because we're more committed.
[00:21:10.580 --> 00:21:14.980]   We have a tendency to get excited, to get kind of tunnel vision about Berean, but not
[00:21:14.980 --> 00:21:16.340]   about the larger kingdom.
[00:21:16.340 --> 00:21:17.340]   Right.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:20.260]   So Paul, he says this quite a bit in all of his letters.
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:21.260]   I give thanks.
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:25.340]   And the other thing that I want to highlight is he begins by thanking God.
[00:21:25.340 --> 00:21:26.340]   Right.
[00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:29.420]   He doesn't say, hey, I heard great things about you.
[00:21:29.420 --> 00:21:30.500]   You guys are doing a great job.
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:32.220]   Keep up, keep up the good job.
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:34.300]   I heard your leaders are exemplary.
[00:21:34.300 --> 00:21:35.300]   Right.
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.500]   He doesn't jump into that.
[00:21:36.500 --> 00:21:42.580]   He recognizes all that is happening in Colossians is because of what God is doing.
[00:21:42.580 --> 00:21:48.220]   And he gives credit to God in every one of these letters, even in the Corinthians.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:52.660]   Before he breaks into all of his rebukes, he begins by saying, I'm so thankful for you
[00:21:52.660 --> 00:21:54.220]   because of what God is doing.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.060]   Because it's evidence that God's grace is upon you.
[00:21:57.060 --> 00:22:00.300]   And part of the reason why all this problem is because God is working in you.
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:02.020]   So he's not talking to non-Christians.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:03.020]   He's talking to Christians.
[00:22:03.020 --> 00:22:07.260]   So he recognizes God's work, even in the context of frustration.
[00:22:07.260 --> 00:22:08.500]   Right.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:15.700]   If you notice here, he begins the father, the son.
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.080]   And where's the Holy Spirit?
[00:22:19.080 --> 00:22:20.580]   In the spirit.
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:21.860]   Right.
[00:22:21.860 --> 00:22:28.320]   So as he gives thanks, he gives credit to the Trinitarian God that he worships.
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:31.980]   It doesn't say that triune God, the father, the son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:22:31.980 --> 00:22:36.740]   And oftentimes you'll see that same reference.
[00:22:36.740 --> 00:22:38.900]   It may not be back to back.
[00:22:38.900 --> 00:22:41.980]   But he realizes that ultimately, father is the initiator.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:44.740]   Jesus Christ is the mediator.
[00:22:44.740 --> 00:22:47.820]   And the agent that causes people to do this is what?
[00:22:47.820 --> 00:22:48.820]   The Holy Spirit.
[00:22:48.820 --> 00:22:49.820]   Right.
[00:22:49.820 --> 00:22:56.700]   So even in this short text, you can see Paul recognizing the Holy Spirit's work in Colossae.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:23:02.940]   He says, "Since we heard of your," and this is probably, if you studied this passage,
[00:23:02.940 --> 00:23:05.900]   you probably saw this already.
[00:23:05.900 --> 00:23:09.140]   "Faith," and what?
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:11.460]   "Love and hope."
[00:23:11.460 --> 00:23:15.940]   Do you see this anywhere else?
[00:23:15.940 --> 00:23:17.660]   All over.
[00:23:17.660 --> 00:23:22.340]   You see that triune virtue of Christianity.
[00:23:22.340 --> 00:23:23.340]   Right.
[00:23:23.340 --> 00:23:24.340]   Faith, love, hope.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:26.100]   Faith, hope, love, hope.
[00:23:26.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   Right.
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:29.500]   And out of these three, which is the greatest?
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:30.860]   Love.
[00:23:30.860 --> 00:23:38.220]   So Paul says he's recognizing God's work in them since he heard of their faith in Christ.
[00:23:38.220 --> 00:23:40.620]   It's not just faith in faith.
[00:23:40.620 --> 00:23:44.220]   Faith specifically in the doctrine of Christ, which is what he's going to be talking about.
[00:23:44.220 --> 00:23:45.220]   Right.
[00:23:45.220 --> 00:23:49.820]   So when he says faith in Christ, that kind of sets the tone for what he's going to say
[00:23:49.820 --> 00:23:52.460]   the rest of Colossians.
[00:23:52.460 --> 00:23:53.940]   You get it?
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:58.560]   So remember I told you why it's important for us to have the bigger picture?
[00:23:58.560 --> 00:24:04.980]   Because we already know he mentions Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ, him, him, him, he, Jesus,
[00:24:04.980 --> 00:24:06.580]   Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.
[00:24:06.580 --> 00:24:07.580]   Right.
[00:24:07.580 --> 00:24:10.640]   So his whole thrust of the letter is to teach Christ.
[00:24:10.640 --> 00:24:15.580]   He begins the letter by saying, "God is doing great work in you," and he already sees the
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:20.540]   Trinitarian work in them, and then he begins by faith in Christ.
[00:24:20.540 --> 00:24:23.020]   And he's going to solidify this in this letter.
[00:24:23.020 --> 00:24:27.140]   What does this faith in Christ look like?
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:29.740]   In doctrine and in practice.
[00:24:29.740 --> 00:24:31.820]   So that kind of sets the tone.
[00:24:31.820 --> 00:24:35.580]   Love, which you have for all the saints.
[00:24:35.580 --> 00:24:36.580]   Right.
[00:24:36.580 --> 00:24:39.780]   So this isn't just any kind of love.
[00:24:39.780 --> 00:24:44.300]   When he says love, he's not just talking about love for the people who are lovable, certain
[00:24:44.300 --> 00:24:45.740]   people who you're close to.
[00:24:45.740 --> 00:24:48.460]   He's saying to all the saints.
[00:24:48.460 --> 00:24:52.180]   This is agape love, covenant love, Christ love.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:53.900]   This is uniquely Christian.
[00:24:53.900 --> 00:24:54.900]   Right.
[00:24:54.900 --> 00:24:57.340]   This is not the kind of love that the world practices.
[00:24:57.340 --> 00:24:58.540]   Uniquely Christian love.
[00:24:58.540 --> 00:25:00.900]   And hope what?
[00:25:00.900 --> 00:25:02.900]   Laid in heaven.
[00:25:02.900 --> 00:25:06.100]   Not hope that if you work hard, your job is going to get better, your relationship is
[00:25:06.100 --> 00:25:10.340]   going to get better, but the hope he's talking about is eternal.
[00:25:10.340 --> 00:25:11.580]   Right.
[00:25:11.580 --> 00:25:18.260]   Because of his faith, that is evidenced by love, motivated by hope.
[00:25:18.260 --> 00:25:20.340]   Right.
[00:25:20.340 --> 00:25:26.660]   But if you notice here, he begins by saying this faith is evidenced by love, and then
[00:25:26.660 --> 00:25:28.900]   he also ends this section by saying what?
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.460]   Your love in the spirit.
[00:25:30.460 --> 00:25:36.380]   So it's sandwiched between, right?
[00:25:36.380 --> 00:25:37.700]   You notice that?
[00:25:37.700 --> 00:25:43.460]   He begins by saying your faith in Christ, love for all the saints, hope in heaven, right,
[00:25:43.460 --> 00:25:44.460]   in the things to come.
[00:25:44.460 --> 00:25:46.580]   And then he also says it twice at the end.
[00:25:46.580 --> 00:25:49.140]   He also informed us of your love in the spirit.
[00:25:49.140 --> 00:25:54.980]   So this section, verses 3 to 8, is a description of God's work in Colossae.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:57.180]   So all of these things are not new.
[00:25:57.180 --> 00:25:58.180]   Right.
[00:25:58.180 --> 00:26:02.660]   If you study any other part of the Bible, you probably have heard this many times before.
[00:26:02.660 --> 00:26:03.700]   Right.
[00:26:03.700 --> 00:26:09.460]   So it emphasizes for us that this is the backbone of Christianity that Paul's talking about.
[00:26:09.460 --> 00:26:15.780]   He's talking about God's work in them, the Trinitarian work, and the way that the fruit
[00:26:15.780 --> 00:26:21.260]   that he sees from that is faith in Christ, which is evidenced by love for all the saints,
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:23.820]   motivated by hope in eternity.
[00:26:23.820 --> 00:26:27.140]   And that pretty much sums up Christian life.
[00:26:27.140 --> 00:26:28.580]   Right.
[00:26:28.580 --> 00:26:34.220]   So the first two chapters, he's going to be talking about Christ, his identity, the second
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:40.620]   person of the Trinity, and then this chapter 3 and 4, he's going to be talking about the
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:44.700]   application of faith, love, and hope.
[00:26:44.700 --> 00:26:46.060]   You get the outline?
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.060]   Okay.
[00:26:47.060 --> 00:26:49.140]   So this is the introduction.
[00:26:49.140 --> 00:26:55.580]   So oftentimes when you're studying the epistles, you'll see an outline of what he's about to
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.900]   say in the very beginning.
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:00.380]   You'll see glimpses of that.
[00:27:00.380 --> 00:27:03.180]   And it points to what he's about to say.
[00:27:03.180 --> 00:27:09.460]   Another thing he talks about, he says, "Which you previously heard of the word of truth,
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:11.460]   the gospel."
[00:27:11.460 --> 00:27:15.380]   So what is bearing fruit?
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:20.980]   Not their strategy, not their intelligence.
[00:27:20.980 --> 00:27:24.860]   What does he say?
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.860]   The gospel.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.060]   Yes, thank you.
[00:27:28.060 --> 00:27:30.980]   The gospel itself is bearing fruit.
[00:27:30.980 --> 00:27:31.980]   Are they working hard?
[00:27:31.980 --> 00:27:32.980]   Yes.
[00:27:32.980 --> 00:27:35.020]   Are there people sacrificing and risking their lives?
[00:27:35.020 --> 00:27:36.020]   Yes.
[00:27:36.020 --> 00:27:38.820]   But the emphasis in Paul is God's working through what?
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.160]   The gospel itself.
[00:27:40.160 --> 00:27:41.740]   And so look what he says about the gospel.
[00:27:41.740 --> 00:27:48.060]   "Which has come to you, just as in all the world, as it is also constantly bearing fruit."
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.580]   I want you to look at these words.
[00:27:49.580 --> 00:27:50.940]   It's bearing fruit.
[00:27:50.940 --> 00:27:54.300]   It is increasing, right?
[00:27:54.300 --> 00:28:02.660]   Since the day that you heard it and then you understood it, just as you learned it.
[00:28:02.660 --> 00:28:05.980]   You see how the gospel, the way he mentions the fruit of the gospel, isn't like you heard
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.300]   it, you believed it, and then you're done.
[00:28:09.300 --> 00:28:14.460]   He describes it in the context of justification and sanctification.
[00:28:14.460 --> 00:28:21.580]   Because he says, "It came to you, it is bearing fruit, and it is increasing."
[00:28:21.580 --> 00:28:26.760]   You weren't just justified and you're done, but the gospel is continuing to bear fruit.
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.820]   And then you heard it and then you understood it.
[00:28:28.820 --> 00:28:34.580]   A lot of people hear the gospel, but then your understanding of the gospel is shallow.
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:37.860]   And because of your understanding of the gospel is shallow, it's very elementary.
[00:28:37.860 --> 00:28:40.180]   Your spiritual life reflects that.
[00:28:40.180 --> 00:28:44.540]   "Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so."
[00:28:44.540 --> 00:28:45.540]   That's great.
[00:28:45.540 --> 00:28:50.260]   That's a backbone of Christianity, but a lot of Christians, that's where they stay.
[00:28:50.260 --> 00:28:52.600]   So they don't see the glory of the gospel.
[00:28:52.600 --> 00:28:54.160]   They don't see the depth of the gospel.
[00:28:54.160 --> 00:28:55.660]   They don't see how much effort went in.
[00:28:55.660 --> 00:28:57.240]   They don't see the sacrifice.
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.060]   They don't see the result.
[00:28:59.060 --> 00:29:03.660]   And so they kind of like, "God so loved the world, he gave his only begotten son.
[00:29:03.660 --> 00:29:04.660]   For by grace we have been saved."
[00:29:04.660 --> 00:29:09.380]   So we have all these elementary things and verses that we regurgitate and we think we
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:14.780]   know, but we know very superficially.
[00:29:14.780 --> 00:29:18.860]   And so if you look at the way he describes the gospel, it's ongoing.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:19.860]   It's bearing fruit.
[00:29:19.860 --> 00:29:20.940]   It is increasing.
[00:29:20.940 --> 00:29:24.400]   It came to your understanding just as you learned it from Epaphras.
[00:29:24.400 --> 00:29:27.300]   You didn't just hear it, they learned it.
[00:29:27.300 --> 00:29:29.540]   And that's what we're doing.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:34.700]   We're trying to learn the gospel we know, but deeper.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:38.500]   And how do all these things connect?
[00:29:38.500 --> 00:29:48.940]   Alright, so everything that I said here, this is not coming from commentary.
[00:29:48.940 --> 00:29:55.720]   If you take time to invest in studying the word of God, you don't need to go to seminary.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.200]   And that's one of the most valuable things that I learned early on in doing the inductive
[00:30:00.200 --> 00:30:01.360]   Bible study.
[00:30:01.360 --> 00:30:06.080]   All the years that I took theology classes and doing Greek papers and all this stuff,
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:11.160]   the first time the Bible really opened up to me was I was doing inductive Bible studies,
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:13.920]   just like this, in First Thessalonians.
[00:30:13.920 --> 00:30:19.060]   And I remember I was cramming, because Bible study was coming up and I wasn't done.
[00:30:19.060 --> 00:30:25.240]   So I went into the library at Biola and I spent four hours just going through the passage,
[00:30:25.240 --> 00:30:29.600]   just asking questions, getting observations, and asking questions, getting observations.
[00:30:29.600 --> 00:30:33.960]   And then by the time I went through about two or three passages like that, I started
[00:30:33.960 --> 00:30:36.760]   gaining insight on my own.
[00:30:36.760 --> 00:30:38.280]   And I started getting excited.
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:43.860]   And then afterwards, I went to read the commentaries just to compare.
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.520]   And what I realized was that everything that the insight I got, it was in the commentary.
[00:30:49.520 --> 00:30:53.480]   So it just kind of confirms, like, okay, this isn't heresy, it's in here.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:59.800]   But the biggest thing that I learned was that the commentators were not giving me any other
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:03.580]   insight that I couldn't get on my own.
[00:31:03.580 --> 00:31:08.160]   The only difference was they spent a lot of time in the verse.
[00:31:08.160 --> 00:31:12.520]   So most of the insights from the commentary wasn't because they knew Greek.
[00:31:12.520 --> 00:31:15.760]   It wasn't because they had this, like, lofty theology and had education.
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:20.880]   It's just they spent a lot of time digging through that text.
[00:31:20.880 --> 00:31:25.120]   And so they were giving insights that I was getting on my own, right?
[00:31:25.120 --> 00:31:32.440]   So this is why I want you to go through inductive Bible study, because I want you to be able
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:37.800]   to look at these verses and take time to ask good questions so that you can come up with
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:38.800]   these insights.
[00:31:38.800 --> 00:31:42.440]   And eventually, you'll see that you become a student of the Word of God, not just hearers,
[00:31:42.440 --> 00:31:46.160]   but you become a student of the Word of God, learning how to ask questions and gain insight.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:53.120]   And if you do that enough, Sunday messages, Bible studies, just a supplement for you.
[00:31:53.120 --> 00:31:56.500]   This should not be your main diet, right?
[00:31:56.500 --> 00:32:00.800]   Your main sustenance should be something that you're able to cook and read and study on
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:01.800]   your own.
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:07.720]   And then you come and you hear a proclamation, and it kind of reinforces what you're doing,
[00:32:07.720 --> 00:32:08.720]   right?
[00:32:08.720 --> 00:32:10.760]   Instead of being dependent on it, it reinforces you.
[00:32:10.760 --> 00:32:17.520]   And then your spiritual life will benefit tremendously if your God is more of a supplement
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:20.800]   for me than the main diet.
[00:32:20.800 --> 00:32:28.040]   So have you guys take some time for the discussion time?
[00:32:28.040 --> 00:32:34.160]   Again, like I said, it's going to probably take about three to four weeks for us to get
[00:32:34.160 --> 00:32:35.860]   into the habit of doing this.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:40.200]   So if you did come prepared this week, good.
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.600]   If not, hopefully as we're going along, you get in the habit of jumping into the text
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:49.800]   yourself so that when you come, you have something to contribute, and then you'll get more out
[00:32:49.800 --> 00:32:50.800]   of it, okay?
[00:32:50.800 --> 00:32:51.800]   So here's the discussion question.
[00:32:51.800 --> 00:32:55.840]   When was the last time you really rejoiced over someone else's salvation or spreading
[00:32:55.840 --> 00:32:58.760]   of the gospel in places you are not personally involved in?
[00:32:58.760 --> 00:33:02.600]   Or do you only rejoice if it's a family friend or personal friend, right?
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:08.840]   Do you really rejoice over God's kingdom, what God is doing, okay?
[00:33:08.840 --> 00:33:11.200]   What is it that you look forward to when you think of eternity?
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:15.640]   What are you eager to leave behind and what are you eager to gain in heaven?
[00:33:15.640 --> 00:33:19.240]   And how often do you think about this and how does that affect the way you live your
[00:33:19.240 --> 00:33:21.720]   life, the way you practice love?
[00:33:21.720 --> 00:33:25.760]   And third, in what way do you see yourself actively engaged in bearing fruit in accordance
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:27.920]   to the gospel?
[00:33:27.920 --> 00:33:31.680]   The gospel itself is bearing fruit, but what part do you play in the gospel bearing fruit
[00:33:31.680 --> 00:33:32.680]   in your life?
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:37.220]   What tangible things are you hoping to accomplish in next week, month, or year?
[00:33:37.220 --> 00:33:41.760]   So after you discuss this, I don't want you to take too much time, but at the very end,
[00:33:41.760 --> 00:33:47.280]   at the bottom of the sheet, like we have questions for the next passage, verse 9 through 12,
[00:33:47.280 --> 00:33:50.900]   okay, which Pastor Mark is going to lead because I'm going to be in India.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:54.820]   And so if you guys can take, just at the very end, we don't want you to take like 15 minutes
[00:33:54.820 --> 00:33:57.600]   talking about this, just to get the group started.
[00:33:57.600 --> 00:34:01.280]   At that tail end, after you've prayed and you've finished, take about five minutes to
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:05.720]   look over that passage and then collectively see if you can come up with some questions.
[00:34:05.720 --> 00:34:08.400]   Not observations, that's for next week.
[00:34:08.400 --> 00:34:12.160]   Come up with some questions for your group to wrestle with, and then when you come back
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:17.400]   next week, you'll try to answer that question in your small group, okay?
[00:34:17.400 --> 00:34:21.440]   All right.
[00:34:21.440 --> 00:34:23.420]   That's your homework, yeah.
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:28.020]   Instead of me giving you the questions, I want you to get in the habit in your small
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:35.000]   groups of asking the questions yourself, instead of me looking at it and giving you the questions.
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:42.360]   Yes, for next week.
[00:34:42.360 --> 00:34:48.120]   All I want you guys to do for the next passage is to just get started.
[00:34:48.120 --> 00:34:53.200]   Like take five minutes at the end of your discussion, looking at this verse and say,
[00:34:53.200 --> 00:34:58.800]   what are five, six questions that you can see from that text, just to get your group
[00:34:58.800 --> 00:34:59.800]   started.
[00:34:59.800 --> 00:35:02.800]   Does that make sense?
[00:35:02.800 --> 00:35:04.800]   Yes.
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   Yes.
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:14.480]   So, you ask your own questions.
[00:35:14.480 --> 00:35:20.480]   I could ask it for you, but part of the inductive Bible study is for you to come up with questions,
[00:35:20.480 --> 00:35:21.480]   okay?
[00:35:21.480 --> 00:35:23.080]   That's part of you study.
[00:35:23.080 --> 00:35:26.480]   So let me pray for us and then I'll get you into your small groups.
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:32.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the study of your word.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:37.840]   And I know, Father God, that many of us in here may have never studied your word in this
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:38.900]   way.
[00:35:38.900 --> 00:35:43.780]   So we pray, especially Father God, through this study, you give us wisdom and insight.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:48.760]   Help us, Lord, not to be afraid to tackle the word and thinking that only pastors and
[00:35:48.760 --> 00:35:51.920]   leaders, Lord God, can gain insight.
[00:35:51.920 --> 00:35:56.920]   And I pray that all of us would truly be Bereans who will search the word to see if what they
[00:35:56.920 --> 00:36:03.480]   are hearing on Sunday, Bible study, in sermons, Lord God, even on the radio, that we will
[00:36:03.480 --> 00:36:07.400]   be able to discern ourselves, Lord God, with your living word.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.120]   And so we ask for your blessing over our discussion.
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:10.120]   Amen.
[00:36:10.120 --> 00:36:10.960]   Amen.
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
