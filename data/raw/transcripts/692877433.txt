[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.640]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Isaiah 61, and I'm going to be reading the first
[00:00:10.640 --> 00:00:12.640]   three verses.
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:24.520]   Again, starting last week, we want to help prepare us for Easter that's coming and for
[00:00:24.520 --> 00:00:26.480]   receiving the Messiah.
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:32.480]   And we want to look at the hope of the Messiah that was embedded into the Jewish culture.
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:38.440]   And hopefully as we go through that, it will help us to prepare for Christ and what He
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:39.440]   came to do.
[00:00:39.440 --> 00:00:46.040]   So I'm looking at Isaiah 61, I'll be reading the first three verses.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:50.420]   The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed me to bring good news
[00:00:50.420 --> 00:00:51.920]   to the afflicted.
[00:00:51.920 --> 00:00:56.540]   He has sent me to bind up the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom
[00:00:56.540 --> 00:01:00.880]   to prisoners, to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord and the day of vengeance of our
[00:01:00.880 --> 00:01:06.100]   God, to comfort all who mourn, to grant those who mourn in Zion, giving them a garland instead
[00:01:06.100 --> 00:01:12.020]   of ashes, the oil of gladness instead of mourning, the mantle of praise instead of a spirit of
[00:01:12.020 --> 00:01:18.460]   fainting, so they will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord that He may be glorified.
[00:01:18.460 --> 00:01:23.060]   That's right.
[00:01:23.060 --> 00:01:33.180]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your word would speak to us, sanctify us, rebuke us, encourage
[00:01:33.180 --> 00:01:39.060]   us and build us up as you are the potter and we are the clay.
[00:01:39.060 --> 00:01:46.140]   Make us Lord God into the image of Christ, that these words Lord would open our eyes
[00:01:46.140 --> 00:01:49.340]   to better prepare our hearts Lord for the work that you are doing.
[00:01:49.340 --> 00:01:53.180]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:53.180 --> 00:01:59.460]   You know a few years back, you know I started to search the internet to find out like when
[00:01:59.460 --> 00:02:01.460]   is middle age?
[00:02:01.460 --> 00:02:08.100]   You know, it ranges all the way from 40 to mid-50s.
[00:02:08.100 --> 00:02:09.980]   And so I was like, mid-50s?
[00:02:09.980 --> 00:02:12.020]   Who lives up to 110?
[00:02:12.020 --> 00:02:18.340]   You know, but you know like whenever that is, I was looking it up because I could see
[00:02:18.340 --> 00:02:22.220]   you know people around me, some people in their mid-40s, some people in their early
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:28.460]   50s kind of wrestling with you know what is the purpose of life and I understand going
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:34.100]   through that stage myself, I can understand why, especially men, I don't know you know,
[00:02:34.100 --> 00:02:40.100]   I don't have personal experience for females, but for men why they go through mid-life crisis.
[00:02:40.100 --> 00:02:43.860]   And it's kind of like you kind of hit a point in your life where you start to think
[00:02:43.860 --> 00:02:48.420]   that the end is much more real than it was ever before, right?
[00:02:48.420 --> 00:02:52.180]   Not that it's not real in your 30s and 40s, but it's much more real.
[00:02:52.180 --> 00:02:54.540]   Okay, so is it going to be another 20 years?
[00:02:54.540 --> 00:02:56.180]   Is it going to be another 30 years?
[00:02:56.180 --> 00:02:58.420]   However it may be, it's much sooner.
[00:02:58.420 --> 00:03:01.680]   We've lived more than we're going to live going forward.
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:07.260]   And so when that thought breaks in, the natural thought is what did I do with my life, right?
[00:03:07.260 --> 00:03:11.300]   The things that I've done, is this enough?
[00:03:11.300 --> 00:03:17.620]   And so a lot of kind of like soul searching and maybe even discouragement and disappointment
[00:03:17.620 --> 00:03:22.700]   and so you know, people do strange things during that period to make them feel like
[00:03:22.700 --> 00:03:26.860]   a makeup or whatever it is, I'm just going to do it, you know.
[00:03:26.860 --> 00:03:31.780]   I think you know, depending on how much time and effort and energy and money that you spent
[00:03:31.780 --> 00:03:38.100]   to build that up and when you get disappointed, the degree of disappointment is greater.
[00:03:38.100 --> 00:03:42.300]   So whether that may be, maybe some people who came from a difficult family thinking
[00:03:42.300 --> 00:03:45.580]   like you know, once I get married, you know, we're going to have a new life and then you
[00:03:45.580 --> 00:03:50.140]   get married and then realize the same difficulty that you saw when you were young, you start
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.600]   to see it in your marriage.
[00:03:52.600 --> 00:03:55.020]   Or whether, whatever that may be, maybe in your kids.
[00:03:55.020 --> 00:03:58.020]   It's like, I'm going to make sure that my kids are going to have this and they're going
[00:03:58.020 --> 00:03:59.680]   to do your best.
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:04.540]   And then time passes by, you realize the struggle of just even raising kids.
[00:04:04.540 --> 00:04:10.620]   And so whatever it is that you put time and effort and money to invest in, and if it doesn't
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.380]   turn out the way that you wanted, the disappointment that comes in as a result of that.
[00:04:16.380 --> 00:04:22.900]   Now all the disappointments that I could possibly think of, the national disappointment of the
[00:04:22.900 --> 00:04:29.620]   Messiah, I mean you can't be exaggerated how disappointed the Jews must have been when
[00:04:29.620 --> 00:04:35.260]   they thought to themselves that this is not the Messiah that they wanted.
[00:04:35.260 --> 00:04:40.940]   The same group that was so excited about Jesus being the Messiah ended up rejecting him at
[00:04:40.940 --> 00:04:43.280]   the end of his life when he was headed toward the cross.
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:50.780]   The text that we looked at right now in Isaiah 61 verses 1-3 is probably one of the most
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:55.920]   clearest presentation of what the Messiah was going to do.
[00:04:55.920 --> 00:05:00.180]   In fact, this is the text that Jesus opens up at the beginning of his ministry.
[00:05:00.180 --> 00:05:04.660]   He goes into the synagogue in Nazareth right after he comes back down being tested for
[00:05:04.660 --> 00:05:07.440]   you know after 40 days of fasting.
[00:05:07.440 --> 00:05:09.980]   This is the very first thing that he does when he starts his ministry.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:15.980]   He opens up the text of Isaiah chapter 61 and then he reads this text and after he reads
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:21.640]   this messianic promise, he said, "Today this is fulfilled in me."
[00:05:21.640 --> 00:05:24.200]   He said, "I am that Messiah."
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:26.640]   So can you imagine the excitement?
[00:05:26.640 --> 00:05:31.600]   So when he said that, some people looked at him and said, "Isn't this Joseph's son?
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:32.720]   How could he be the Messiah?
[00:05:32.720 --> 00:05:35.360]   We remember playing with him."
[00:05:35.360 --> 00:05:37.860]   Maybe some of the adults said, "We remember that kid.
[00:05:37.860 --> 00:05:39.260]   How can he be the Messiah?"
[00:05:39.260 --> 00:05:42.320]   And then some of them responded by saying, "Man, is he?
[00:05:42.320 --> 00:05:43.860]   Could he possibly be?"
[00:05:43.860 --> 00:05:49.580]   So for the next three years of his ministry, they watched him carefully.
[00:05:49.580 --> 00:05:52.600]   Could he possibly be the Messiah?
[00:05:52.600 --> 00:05:57.220]   And everything that he did proved over and over again.
[00:05:57.220 --> 00:06:03.680]   So you remember when Jesus feeds the 5,000 that this stirring of the crowd got to the
[00:06:03.680 --> 00:06:09.920]   point where after he fed the 5,000, they were going to forcibly make him king.
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.740]   And that's why Jesus was trying to escape the crowd because it wasn't time for him.
[00:06:15.740 --> 00:06:18.940]   But this is exactly the kind of king that you would want.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:23.740]   If you were to imagine that the king was going to come and deliver you from the nation, I
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:29.700]   mean, he's humble, he's powerful, he's compassionate, he's caring.
[00:06:29.700 --> 00:06:34.220]   People who had no hope, he started giving them hope by the thousands.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:37.420]   So of course they would want him to be king.
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:44.060]   But that same crowd, one by one, begins to turn against him when Jesus began to tell
[00:06:44.060 --> 00:06:46.380]   them why he really came.
[00:06:46.380 --> 00:06:50.100]   "I'm giving you bread, but it's not the bread that I came to give.
[00:06:50.100 --> 00:06:53.580]   I'm performing miracles, but this is not the reason.
[00:06:53.580 --> 00:06:56.700]   So that it's not simply so that the lame could walk."
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:07:01.460]   He said, "He performed all these miracles so that I can forgive you of your sins."
[00:07:01.460 --> 00:07:06.940]   And once they began to realize that maybe Jesus wasn't going to fulfill their dreams,
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:09.260]   one by one they began to lose them.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:14.360]   And then when he actually went to the cross, they said, "Oh, he really is giving his
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:15.360]   life up.
[00:07:15.360 --> 00:07:17.500]   He isn't going to fulfill these dreams."
[00:07:17.500 --> 00:07:21.860]   And so that same crowd that followed him for three years rejected him when he went to the
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.100]   cross.
[00:07:23.100 --> 00:07:28.980]   See, this hope of the Messiah for the king, it didn't start just with the nation of
[00:07:28.980 --> 00:07:29.980]   Israel.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:32.500]   In fact, it starts all the way in Genesis.
[00:07:32.500 --> 00:07:37.500]   In Genesis chapter 3, 15, right after the fall, God makes this promise, "I will put
[00:07:37.500 --> 00:07:41.380]   my enmity between you and the woman and between your seed and her seed.
[00:07:41.380 --> 00:07:45.560]   She shall bruise you on the head and you shall bruise him on the heel."
[00:07:45.560 --> 00:07:51.900]   And so the theologians call this proto-evangelium, basically means pre-gospel, that God said
[00:07:51.900 --> 00:07:56.060]   from the very beginning that he was going to send the seed of the woman and he's going
[00:07:56.060 --> 00:07:59.060]   to crush the head of the serpent.
[00:07:59.060 --> 00:08:03.600]   You ever wonder why the Bible is filled with genealogies, right?
[00:08:03.600 --> 00:08:07.720]   I don't know if you've ever really given yourself to study these genealogies, but these genealogies
[00:08:07.720 --> 00:08:09.620]   are there for a reason.
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:16.780]   They're there because every genealogy is the record of God's fulfillment of this promise.
[00:08:16.780 --> 00:08:20.900]   So they're connecting that whoever is going to come down this line, that they have a clear
[00:08:20.900 --> 00:08:22.440]   record.
[00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:28.940]   So they teach you, even though we may not fully understand, that when the Messiah shows
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:32.260]   up, they can have this record of who he is.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:36.980]   That's why if you open up the book of Matthew, right, the first thing that you see in the
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:42.380]   book of Matthew is the genealogy, because this genealogy connects Jesus with the promise
[00:08:42.380 --> 00:08:46.780]   of the Davidic kingdom, with the promise that he made to Abraham, the promise that goes
[00:08:46.780 --> 00:08:52.920]   all the way back to the creation after the fall.
[00:08:52.920 --> 00:08:59.460]   But you can understand the disappointment that after waiting for this Messiah to come,
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.560]   after not only just hundreds but thousands of years of waiting, that he didn't turn out
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:08.100]   to be what they thought he would be.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:14.980]   You see, when Isaiah writes this, the book of Isaiah, he wrote it around 722 BC.
[00:09:14.980 --> 00:09:19.840]   The northern kingdom has already fallen to the Assyrians.
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:24.780]   And so he writes this saying that now because of your sin, the southern kingdom, the tribe
[00:09:24.780 --> 00:09:28.460]   of Judah and the tribe of Benjamin, is also going to fall.
[00:09:28.460 --> 00:09:32.220]   And so he's predicting that the Babylonians that they were relying on to come and help
[00:09:32.220 --> 00:09:35.060]   him, they're the ones who are going to take you into captivity.
[00:09:35.060 --> 00:09:40.860]   And so all the prophecies that are said about the judgment that's coming happens about 140
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:43.340]   years after this book is written.
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:49.220]   So everything that he says actually gets fulfilled, that all their children get carried on to
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:53.580]   Babylon and eventually they adjust and they start to live.
[00:09:53.580 --> 00:09:57.380]   And again, you remember reading the book of Daniel and it tells us what their life was
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:59.960]   like in captivity.
[00:09:59.960 --> 00:10:02.340]   But it wasn't short-lived.
[00:10:02.340 --> 00:10:05.480]   After them, the Persians came in.
[00:10:05.480 --> 00:10:09.180]   And then the Persians, during the Persian reign, because of God's work, and as Isaiah
[00:10:09.180 --> 00:10:13.420]   predicted, King Cyrus comes in and has compassion and says he allows them to go.
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.900]   But by that time, the Israelites have been so accustomed to staying where they are, only
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:23.200]   a very small percentage of them come back to build the second temple.
[00:10:23.200 --> 00:10:28.280]   When they built the second temple, the people who remember the first temple were weeping.
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:32.560]   Because this could not be the fulfillment of that prophecy.
[00:10:32.560 --> 00:10:33.560]   How can this be?
[00:10:33.560 --> 00:10:37.020]   Because the glory of the second temple was nothing like what it was in the beginning.
[00:10:37.020 --> 00:10:40.940]   But the Bible says that the glory is going to far outweigh anything that they've seen
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.460]   up to that point.
[00:10:42.460 --> 00:10:45.740]   So the older people realized that this could not be the fulfillment.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:47.980]   And it was not.
[00:10:47.980 --> 00:10:52.460]   So their momentary excitement goes right back into despair.
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:58.060]   A couple hundred years later, Alexander the Great comes in and he comes and takes over
[00:10:58.060 --> 00:11:00.460]   and they're under their oppression for a couple hundred years.
[00:11:00.460 --> 00:11:03.620]   And then after that, the Romans come in.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:12.500]   And so for over 700 years, they've been waiting specifically for this prophecy to be fulfilled.
[00:11:12.500 --> 00:11:16.500]   You have to understand what their life was like, specifically under the Romans.
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:21.660]   Romans did their best to kind of keep the foreign nations that they conquered under
[00:11:21.660 --> 00:11:22.660]   submission.
[00:11:22.660 --> 00:11:26.980]   And so they gave them enough freedom, allowed them to rule their little areas, but they
[00:11:26.980 --> 00:11:34.700]   also wanted to make sure that everyday life was a reminder to them who the boss was.
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:40.260]   So remember when Jesus tells in his parables and in his teaching, he says, "If they ask
[00:11:40.260 --> 00:11:42.860]   you to go a mile, go the second mile."
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:47.860]   The reason why he says that was because there was a Roman law that said if a Roman soldier,
[00:11:47.860 --> 00:11:53.020]   as he's walking down and he just gets tired, and he could just ask any Jew, he could just
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.780]   ask anybody, even if you're a young mother with small children, if he just got tired,
[00:11:57.780 --> 00:12:04.380]   by law, they had to drop what they were doing and carry at least a mile, by law.
[00:12:04.380 --> 00:12:08.980]   And that's why he was saying, he's talking specifically to people in that culture, that
[00:12:08.980 --> 00:12:14.060]   instead of rebelling, go the second mile.
[00:12:14.060 --> 00:12:18.740]   And in fact, if you happen to be very religious and you were going to the temple, they set
[00:12:18.740 --> 00:12:21.140]   up a statue of Caesar outside.
[00:12:21.140 --> 00:12:27.540]   So even as you go to worship your God, the Romans made sure that every time you went
[00:12:27.540 --> 00:12:32.540]   to the temple, there was a reminder that our God is much more superior than yours.
[00:12:32.540 --> 00:12:36.660]   And made them bow down to that in order to get to the temple.
[00:12:36.660 --> 00:12:39.140]   That's the oppression that they were living under.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:40.580]   And I'm just scratching the surface.
[00:12:40.580 --> 00:12:44.900]   We could spend the whole Sunday just talking about the oppression that they were under.
[00:12:44.900 --> 00:12:51.100]   And for 700 years, every time they felt some sort of injustice, every time they went to
[00:12:51.100 --> 00:12:56.820]   the temple, every time a young mother or young man who had to carry all the equipment of
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:02.300]   the soldiers for a mile, they probably reminded each other, Messiah is coming.
[00:13:02.300 --> 00:13:03.660]   One day Messiah is going to come.
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:07.980]   One day he's going to come and he's going to do everything that he had promised.
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:13.260]   And so it was that, that Jesus came and he read this.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.140]   This is talking about me.
[00:13:15.140 --> 00:13:17.900]   I'm finally here.
[00:13:17.900 --> 00:13:20.700]   So you could understand the excitement that they were in.
[00:13:20.700 --> 00:13:27.700]   And for three years, everything he did was to prove that that's who he was.
[00:13:27.700 --> 00:13:33.300]   See there was this longing in the Israelites that I cannot exaggerate.
[00:13:33.300 --> 00:13:39.340]   The amount of time, energy, tears that went into waiting for the Messiah.
[00:13:39.340 --> 00:13:45.100]   You know, if you read the Psalms, you probably remember at some point in the Psalm, you'll
[00:13:45.100 --> 00:13:48.700]   see the term "selah," right?
[00:13:48.700 --> 00:13:49.940]   You guys remember there's "selah."
[00:13:49.940 --> 00:13:53.340]   If you don't, if you go back and read the Psalms, you'll see "selah" just scattered
[00:13:53.340 --> 00:13:55.300]   all throughout the Psalms.
[00:13:55.300 --> 00:13:59.060]   The theologians don't know exactly what that term means, right?
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:02.260]   There's no exact Hebrew interpretation of that.
[00:14:02.260 --> 00:14:07.380]   And so some have said that maybe it's a musical thing, like the intermission or maybe a crescendo,
[00:14:07.380 --> 00:14:08.380]   right?
[00:14:08.380 --> 00:14:11.860]   Maybe when you get there, you're supposed to read it louder, right?
[00:14:11.860 --> 00:14:12.940]   Some people believe that.
[00:14:12.940 --> 00:14:17.700]   I think the common interpretation of "selah" is to kind of take a breather, take a break,
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:18.700]   right?
[00:14:18.700 --> 00:14:22.540]   To read that and kind of pause a second and then to read it.
[00:14:22.540 --> 00:14:28.300]   I think that what makes most sense is that it's kind of like a sighing.
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:32.100]   It is a break, but it's not simply a break because it's a long Psalm and you need to
[00:14:32.100 --> 00:14:34.380]   breathe before you keep reading.
[00:14:34.380 --> 00:14:37.340]   But I believe "selah" basically is a deep sighing.
[00:14:37.340 --> 00:14:41.940]   Like when something, when you're thinking something deeply or emotionally, you're affected,
[00:14:41.940 --> 00:14:42.940]   you would …
[00:14:42.940 --> 00:14:48.540]   So the promises of Messiah.
[00:14:48.540 --> 00:14:54.140]   You know, if you ever study through the book of Psalms, two-thirds of it is a groanings
[00:14:54.140 --> 00:14:55.140]   of Israel.
[00:14:55.140 --> 00:14:57.060]   "Where are you?
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:14:59.100]   Why do you let the wicked prosper?"
[00:14:59.100 --> 00:15:05.860]   Two-thirds of the Psalm is in some way is an expression of their pain.
[00:15:05.860 --> 00:15:12.820]   So all throughout the book of Psalms is a "selah," a groaning.
[00:15:12.820 --> 00:15:16.220]   And I believe that's exactly what it is, the equivalent in the New Testament is this
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:20.460]   groaning that the Bible says that the Holy Spirit that's been deposited in us groans
[00:15:20.460 --> 00:15:23.380]   on our behalf with words that you and I cannot recognize.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:27.140]   Groaning, sighing.
[00:15:27.140 --> 00:15:30.420]   The Holy Spirit in us is sighing.
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:36.300]   Before we became Christian, the Holy Spirit is groaning to bring us to Christ.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:43.940]   So in His groaning, justification is the deliverance of the penalty of sin.
[00:15:43.940 --> 00:15:47.700]   Sanctification is the deliverance from the power of sin.
[00:15:47.700 --> 00:15:52.940]   And glorification is the deliverance from the presence of sin.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:16:00.500]   And so this groaning inside of us, the Holy Spirit, is sighing on our behalf in prayer
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:03.300]   that we would be justified.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:08.440]   And in our sanctification, in our wrestling with our flesh, in our constant desire to
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:13.940]   be right and then wrestling with our flesh, taking us other places, sighing.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:20.540]   Oh, I've got to struggle with this again.
[00:16:20.540 --> 00:16:26.020]   Struggling with it again.
[00:16:26.020 --> 00:16:29.780]   Which creates in us the ultimate groaning.
[00:16:29.780 --> 00:16:32.140]   When will this end?
[00:16:32.140 --> 00:16:34.380]   When is He going to come?
[00:16:34.380 --> 00:16:38.060]   When will we be delivered from the presence of this sin?
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:44.260]   So I believe that Selah all throughout the book of Psalms is a deep sighing.
[00:16:44.260 --> 00:16:47.580]   Lord, when are you coming?
[00:16:47.580 --> 00:16:50.940]   When will you come and answer this prayer?
[00:16:50.940 --> 00:16:54.260]   When will you wipe away our tears?
[00:16:54.260 --> 00:16:58.700]   When will you deliver us from our enemies?
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:17:06.300]   So this groaning God has placed in their heart so that when the Messiah comes, that the celebration
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:09.380]   would match their groaning.
[00:17:09.380 --> 00:17:13.940]   This text that we're looking at in Psalm chapter 60, 1 to 3, gives us five things that
[00:17:13.940 --> 00:17:15.980]   He promises that I want to review.
[00:17:15.980 --> 00:17:21.020]   First thing He says, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed
[00:17:21.020 --> 00:17:22.020]   me."
[00:17:22.020 --> 00:17:26.900]   And the point of this is to separate Him from any other king, any other prophet.
[00:17:26.900 --> 00:17:30.900]   Because typically when anointing happens, it would be the previous king or the prophet
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:34.020]   or one of the priests would come and lay hands and anoint Him.
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:39.780]   But He says when the Messiah comes, He will be directly anointed by God Himself.
[00:17:39.780 --> 00:17:41.420]   That God's Spirit is going to be upon Him.
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:48.820]   So if you remember, before Jesus reads this text in the synagogue in Luke chapter 4, remember
[00:17:48.820 --> 00:17:50.300]   what happens to Jesus?
[00:17:50.300 --> 00:17:52.300]   He gets baptized.
[00:17:52.300 --> 00:17:57.260]   Remember at baptism, heaven opens up and Jesus gets anointed and God the Father says, "This
[00:17:57.260 --> 00:18:00.980]   is my Son in whom I am in love."
[00:18:00.980 --> 00:18:04.500]   And so He was anointed and separated and then He goes up and gets tested.
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:10.340]   And then right after that beginning of the ceremony, beginning of the text here, He reads
[00:18:10.340 --> 00:18:12.820]   it and says, "This is who I am."
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:18.940]   To be anointed by God means that He was unlike any other king, any other priest.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:22.940]   That He was going to represent all the authority.
[00:18:22.940 --> 00:18:25.980]   Not somebody who was going to come and disappear.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:31.460]   Not like Moses, though he was a great leader, came and he had his own faults.
[00:18:31.460 --> 00:18:35.040]   Where he was disqualified to even enter into the promised land.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.540]   Not like David who was a man after God's own heart who did great in the beginning, but
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:43.660]   at the tail end of it, he commits adultery and then he even becomes a murderer.
[00:18:43.660 --> 00:18:47.900]   And as a result of that, he's not allowed to build a temple and his kingdom gets split.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:54.060]   Solomon comes in, wisest man, builds a temple, but he chases after the world with all the
[00:18:54.060 --> 00:18:55.660]   knowledge that he has.
[00:18:55.660 --> 00:19:02.700]   And every king that came after them, majority of them, led the nation astray.
[00:19:02.700 --> 00:19:08.820]   And the very few kings who were right with God started off well and then they kind of
[00:19:08.820 --> 00:19:10.420]   tapered off at the end.
[00:19:10.420 --> 00:19:12.900]   Hezekiah was one of those kings.
[00:19:12.900 --> 00:19:20.180]   If you were to name one of maybe like four kings that was good in Israel's history, Hezekiah
[00:19:20.180 --> 00:19:21.660]   would be one of them.
[00:19:21.660 --> 00:19:26.980]   But remember Hezekiah in chapter 39, that at the end of his life, he started to align
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.500]   himself with the Babylonians because he forgot who God is.
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:34.860]   See, when he says, "The Spirit of the Lord God is upon me because the Lord has anointed
[00:19:34.860 --> 00:19:38.620]   me," he's saying he's going to be different than any other king.
[00:19:38.620 --> 00:19:42.780]   God himself is going to be working through this man, this Messiah.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:47.180]   Number two, he said he's going to bring good news to the afflicted.
[00:19:47.180 --> 00:19:52.940]   Some of your translations, they says poor, but that is a poor translation of that word.
[00:19:52.940 --> 00:19:57.300]   Because when you say poor, you also have been afflicted and hurt and damaged.
[00:19:57.300 --> 00:20:01.820]   So you could be financially poor, yes, but this word carries a much more significant
[00:20:01.820 --> 00:20:03.900]   ... I can't send that.
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.460]   He's talking about people who have been afflicted.
[00:20:07.460 --> 00:20:13.060]   Living under oppression, but more specifically, more broadly, people who have been affected
[00:20:13.060 --> 00:20:15.140]   by sin.
[00:20:15.140 --> 00:20:18.540]   And that word, euangelion, the good news, right?
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:23.700]   And you already know in the New Testament, the word gospel is euangelion, which literally
[00:20:23.700 --> 00:20:25.100]   means good news.
[00:20:25.100 --> 00:20:29.860]   That this one who has been anointed by God is going to come and he's going to be spreading
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:34.740]   the good news to those who are afflicted.
[00:20:34.740 --> 00:20:44.140]   Every single one of us has been afflicted by your own sins and the sins of others.
[00:20:44.140 --> 00:20:47.100]   There's not a single person here.
[00:20:47.100 --> 00:20:52.300]   Some of us may be more aware of it than other people because we live in a fallen world.
[00:20:52.300 --> 00:20:57.540]   And because we live in a fallen world, your parents were fallen, your grandparents were
[00:20:57.540 --> 00:21:03.100]   fallen, your school teachers were fallen, and you were fallen.
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:08.660]   As a result of that, there are things that we have said and done that hurt other people.
[00:21:08.660 --> 00:21:13.900]   And as a result of that, there's things that people have said and done that hurt us.
[00:21:13.900 --> 00:21:19.900]   So every human being that has been born in this life has been afflicted in one way or
[00:21:19.900 --> 00:21:20.900]   another.
[00:21:20.900 --> 00:21:24.940]   He said he came to bring good news.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:29.040]   And then he goes on in number three, he says, "He sent me to bind up, to literally wrap
[00:21:29.040 --> 00:21:32.660]   up those who are brokenhearted."
[00:21:32.660 --> 00:21:40.740]   Psalm 34, 18, "The Lord is near to the brokenhearted and saves those who are crushed in spirit."
[00:21:40.740 --> 00:21:44.700]   It's much easier to build community with young people.
[00:21:44.700 --> 00:21:48.300]   You don't have as much baggage.
[00:21:48.300 --> 00:21:50.100]   You have this idealism, "We're going to build a community.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.100]   We're going to love each other.
[00:21:51.100 --> 00:21:52.100]   We're going to raise our children together.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:53.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.740]   We're going to take vacations together.
[00:21:54.740 --> 00:21:57.740]   We're going to open up Sunday schools and build schools."
[00:21:57.740 --> 00:22:02.380]   And by the time you get to a certain age, it's like, "Yeah, right.
[00:22:02.380 --> 00:22:03.380]   With who?
[00:22:03.380 --> 00:22:05.260]   How do I trust them?"
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:08.620]   You sure you want our kids to be friends with those people?
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:13.740]   It's much harder to build community with older people because we've experienced more of this
[00:22:13.740 --> 00:22:22.260]   world of being disappointed, relationships not working out, leaders disappointing us.
[00:22:22.260 --> 00:22:28.460]   And so there's years and years of this kind of got piled up, and so it's naturally easier
[00:22:28.460 --> 00:22:31.060]   to be cynical.
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:34.380]   We don't have the same kind of idealism when we were younger.
[00:22:34.380 --> 00:22:38.740]   That's what happens when you live in a fallen world.
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:45.500]   You know, when I was a young youth pastor, I heard a statistic that one in four girls
[00:22:45.500 --> 00:22:49.900]   experience some sort of molestation when they're young.
[00:22:49.900 --> 00:22:50.900]   One in four.
[00:22:50.900 --> 00:22:52.500]   When I first heard that, I couldn't believe it.
[00:22:52.500 --> 00:22:58.500]   It's like, "Oh, maybe in some other communities, maybe in other parts of the world."
[00:22:58.500 --> 00:23:06.460]   But through the years, not only has that been confirmed, I think it's much larger than that
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:15.340]   because majority of the abuse that takes place happens within the home because you feel safe.
[00:23:15.340 --> 00:23:19.420]   And so the things that are reported is one in four.
[00:23:19.420 --> 00:23:24.340]   So there are many of those instances that are never reported because it's sticky within
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:25.340]   the family.
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:36.540]   So can you imagine one in four child, and now it's male or female, has experienced some
[00:23:36.540 --> 00:23:40.580]   sort of sexual trauma when they were young?
[00:23:40.580 --> 00:23:45.100]   And I remember trying to counsel through that.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:49.260]   What can I possibly say to make this better?
[00:23:49.260 --> 00:23:53.580]   Just praying, like, "Lord, Holy Spirit, just bring transformation."
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:55.220]   Reading books, asking for help.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.340]   What can I possibly do?
[00:23:56.340 --> 00:24:01.980]   What can I possibly say to counsel them, to give them hope?
[00:24:01.980 --> 00:24:09.460]   And after years of frustration, I came to the conclusion that the only one that could
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:14.660]   deliver them from this pain is Christ.
[00:24:14.660 --> 00:24:20.620]   So the best that I can do is not to have the right words or the system or the accountability
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.860]   or the community, is to bring them to Christ.
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:31.180]   Every single one of us has experienced some sort of brokenness, either directly or indirectly
[00:24:31.180 --> 00:24:33.700]   through family.
[00:24:33.700 --> 00:24:35.100]   Christ says He will come.
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:41.300]   Our Messiah is going to come, and He's going to bind up the brokenhearted.
[00:24:41.300 --> 00:24:49.060]   Every single one of these Jews, one way or another, have been oppressed for 700 plus
[00:24:49.060 --> 00:24:51.200]   years.
[00:24:51.200 --> 00:24:55.620]   Can you imagine the excitement when Jesus says, "I am the Messiah"?
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:56.620]   Finally.
[00:24:56.620 --> 00:25:04.660]   Then He says He's going to proclaim liberty to the captives and freedom to the prisoners.
[00:25:04.660 --> 00:25:10.260]   You know, today, when the president leaves office, one of the final things that he does
[00:25:10.260 --> 00:25:16.580]   is he uses his authority and power to pardon people who may be in jail and uses authority
[00:25:16.580 --> 00:25:17.580]   to do that.
[00:25:17.580 --> 00:25:20.100]   Sometimes there's a few, sometimes it can be many dozens of people.
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:24.780]   But in the ancient Near East, the practice was when the king would be anointed, and the
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:28.500]   very first thing that he does is he would release the prisoners.
[00:25:28.500 --> 00:25:30.820]   Because he may not be in agreement with the previous king.
[00:25:30.820 --> 00:25:33.700]   Maybe the ones who were supporting him, they were the ones in prison.
[00:25:33.700 --> 00:25:38.180]   So it was custom that the people who were desperate to come out would be waiting for
[00:25:38.180 --> 00:25:41.540]   the next king to be anointed.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.180]   Because that would be the first thing that he does.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:50.740]   So it is in that spirit, he says, when your king comes, he will deliver all those prisoners
[00:25:50.740 --> 00:25:53.060]   who have been bound.
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:57.060]   That the only hope that they had for the next king, the righteous king, to come and deliver
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:58.440]   them.
[00:25:58.440 --> 00:26:03.300]   And then he finally says to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:07.220]   It's clearly, this is in reference to the year of Jubilee that's mentioned in Leviticus
[00:26:07.220 --> 00:26:09.540]   chapter 25.
[00:26:09.540 --> 00:26:14.140]   The year of Jubilee, like in Jewish law, every seven years they were supposed to give the
[00:26:14.140 --> 00:26:15.740]   land rest.
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.380]   In order to recuperate.
[00:26:17.380 --> 00:26:19.380]   And then the seventh year they would do this again.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:25.180]   But every seven times seven, after 49 years, the 50th year, it was declared to be the year
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.180]   of Jubilee.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:30.020]   Now, I don't have time to go through all of the things that are taught about the year
[00:26:30.020 --> 00:26:34.420]   of Jubilee, but let me just give you a quick summary of what they were to do at the year
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:35.420]   of Jubilee.
[00:26:35.420 --> 00:26:37.980]   All debts were canceled.
[00:26:37.980 --> 00:26:45.060]   Now, if you're in finance, or if you just, you know, pay attention to finance, how can
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:46.060]   this be?
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:48.700]   All debts canceled.
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:50.580]   Can you imagine the bankers being stingy?
[00:26:50.580 --> 00:26:55.820]   He's like, next year's year of Jubilee, I can't lend you that.
[00:26:55.820 --> 00:26:57.380]   How can this possibly work?
[00:26:57.380 --> 00:27:01.540]   All land, it says number two, was returned to the original owners.
[00:27:01.540 --> 00:27:08.700]   So if you leased land, in the 50th year, you have to give it back.
[00:27:08.700 --> 00:27:12.060]   All the slaves were free, without exception.
[00:27:12.060 --> 00:27:13.860]   All slaves were free.
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:16.540]   Everybody was given a fresh new beginning.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:19.780]   Now this sounds good on paper, but how can this possibly work?
[00:27:19.780 --> 00:27:24.360]   Can you imagine what the economy would have looked like on their 49th year?
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:26.140]   Who would lend any money?
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:28.380]   Who would do any business?
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:32.100]   But if you were a poor person, it's like, yeah, I'll take that.
[00:27:32.100 --> 00:27:34.260]   Take all the debt.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:42.160]   See, the whole point of the year of Jubilee was to point to what was coming in Christ.
[00:27:42.160 --> 00:27:47.580]   Just like the cities of refuge, like all the amount of money and time and effort that went
[00:27:47.580 --> 00:27:50.060]   to build these streets.
[00:27:50.060 --> 00:27:51.060]   And who used these streets?
[00:27:51.060 --> 00:27:54.200]   The people who killed accidentally.
[00:27:54.200 --> 00:27:55.820]   How many people used these roads?
[00:27:55.820 --> 00:27:59.460]   Like, so much money, time, and effort went into building these cities.
[00:27:59.460 --> 00:28:01.300]   For what purpose?
[00:28:01.300 --> 00:28:05.380]   So that every Jew, when they looked on the cities of refuge, they realized when the Messiah
[00:28:05.380 --> 00:28:09.020]   comes, he's going to build these cities for us.
[00:28:09.020 --> 00:28:14.620]   So the whole point of the year of Jubilee is to remind us when the Messiah comes, this
[00:28:14.620 --> 00:28:17.580]   is what he's going to do.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:22.260]   And so he said when the Messiah comes, all debt will be canceled.
[00:28:22.260 --> 00:28:24.380]   All slave will be set free.
[00:28:24.380 --> 00:28:31.860]   All the lands, and there's going to be a fresh start in his kingdom.
[00:28:31.860 --> 00:28:35.740]   Why did they miss this?
[00:28:35.740 --> 00:28:40.060]   I mean, they were waiting for this for so long.
[00:28:40.060 --> 00:28:43.420]   And for three years, they followed him.
[00:28:43.420 --> 00:28:46.460]   Who else can walk on water?
[00:28:46.460 --> 00:28:49.060]   Who else can feed 5,000?
[00:28:49.060 --> 00:28:51.780]   Who else can tell the storm to stop, and it stops?
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:55.740]   Who else can raise the dead?
[00:28:55.740 --> 00:29:00.940]   So can you imagine the excitement when Jesus went into Jerusalem riding on a donkey, because
[00:29:00.940 --> 00:29:05.060]   there's a specific prophecy that says that your Messiah, the King, is going to ride on
[00:29:05.060 --> 00:29:06.460]   a donkey when he comes in.
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:11.580]   And so Jesus chooses to ride on a donkey to fulfill that prophecy, to make a public declaration,
[00:29:11.580 --> 00:29:12.580]   I am he.
[00:29:12.580 --> 00:29:18.900]   If any of you had any doubt who I was, let this confirm.
[00:29:18.900 --> 00:29:26.940]   But that rejoicing turned into weeping when they realized that Jesus was actually going
[00:29:26.940 --> 00:29:29.260]   to the cross.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:36.260]   If you read the text that Jesus read in Luke chapter 4, 17 to 21, Jesus reads only a portion
[00:29:36.260 --> 00:29:38.140]   of this prophecy.
[00:29:38.140 --> 00:29:39.660]   He doesn't read verse 1 to 3.
[00:29:39.660 --> 00:29:43.300]   He only reads up to the middle of the second verse.
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:46.860]   And he says, he reads, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon me because he anointed me to
[00:29:46.860 --> 00:29:48.580]   preach the gospel to the poor.
[00:29:48.580 --> 00:29:51.460]   He has sent me to proclaim the release of the captives and recovery of the sight to
[00:29:51.460 --> 00:29:57.380]   the blind, to set free those who are oppressed, to proclaim the favorable year of the Lord."
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:02.340]   So if you read 61, that stops in the first line.
[00:30:02.340 --> 00:30:06.180]   The second part where it says, "And the day of vengeance of our God to comfort all who
[00:30:06.180 --> 00:30:07.180]   mourn."
[00:30:07.180 --> 00:30:12.980]   And then at the end of it, he says, "So that they will," at the end of verse 3, "So they
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:17.220]   will be called oaks of righteousness, the planting of the Lord, that he may be glorified."
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:19.880]   He doesn't read that part.
[00:30:19.880 --> 00:30:25.780]   And there's a reason he doesn't read that part, because he doesn't fulfill that then.
[00:30:25.780 --> 00:30:30.420]   There's a second part of that fulfillment that's going to come at the end.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:36.900]   But his first coming was to fulfill what he says in Isaiah 42.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:41.620]   In verse 1 through 4, it says, "Behold, my servant whom I uphold, my chosen one in whom
[00:30:41.620 --> 00:30:44.580]   my soul delights, I have put my spirit upon him.
[00:30:44.580 --> 00:30:49.100]   He will bring forth justice to the nations."
[00:30:49.100 --> 00:30:55.500]   How many of us think of Jesus' ministry as a ministry of justice?
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:30:57.380]   We don't.
[00:30:57.380 --> 00:31:05.900]   We think of it as a ministry of grace, compassion, love, gentleness, perseverance, and yet he
[00:31:05.900 --> 00:31:09.820]   says he came to bring justice.
[00:31:09.820 --> 00:31:12.660]   Did he change his mind?
[00:31:12.660 --> 00:31:17.380]   Did he think that maybe justice isn't what he wants anymore?
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.180]   Well, he describes this justice in verse 2 and 3.
[00:31:20.180 --> 00:31:26.940]   "He will not cry out or raise his voice, nor make his voice heard in the street.
[00:31:26.940 --> 00:31:32.260]   A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning wick he will not extinguish.
[00:31:32.260 --> 00:31:36.660]   He will faithfully bring forth justice.
[00:31:36.660 --> 00:31:40.420]   He will not be disheartened or crushed until he has established justice in this earth,
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:45.060]   and the coastlands will wait expectantly for his law."
[00:31:45.060 --> 00:31:48.220]   What justice is he referring to?
[00:31:48.220 --> 00:31:51.140]   What is he referring to?
[00:31:51.140 --> 00:31:59.300]   The justice that he is referring to, the justice that he carried out at the cross.
[00:31:59.300 --> 00:32:06.220]   He absorbed the greatest injustice, the only person who can cry out to his Father, "Why
[00:32:06.220 --> 00:32:10.380]   have you done this to me?"
[00:32:10.380 --> 00:32:16.420]   There's not a single human being that could be in that position and dare to lift his eyes
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:18.740]   and say, "Why have you done this to me?"
[00:32:18.740 --> 00:32:21.760]   Because we know why he's doing that to us.
[00:32:21.760 --> 00:32:23.660]   Because we deserve it.
[00:32:23.660 --> 00:32:25.700]   We rebelled against him.
[00:32:25.700 --> 00:32:27.300]   We've sinned against him.
[00:32:27.300 --> 00:32:29.180]   We sinned against one another.
[00:32:29.180 --> 00:32:35.860]   So when he does that, when he brings punishment, we can't open our mouth.
[00:32:35.860 --> 00:32:43.460]   Only the pure, perfect Jesus can cry out to his Father.
[00:32:43.460 --> 00:32:51.980]   Because the only person that was deserving of God's love was Jesus himself.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:33:01.540]   So the greatest injustice was absorbed by Christ in order that those with sin would
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:06.460]   be justified before God.
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:12.100]   That the unjust will become just.
[00:33:12.100 --> 00:33:15.660]   This is what they did not understand.
[00:33:15.660 --> 00:33:20.840]   Because they portrayed upon Christ their dreams, every suffering, that when Messiah's come
[00:33:20.840 --> 00:33:22.860]   he's going to deliver us from this.
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:25.100]   If you had no legs, he's going to come bring us legs.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.260]   If I'm blind, he's going to open up my eyes.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.140]   If I'm in prison, he's going to release me.
[00:33:29.140 --> 00:33:31.940]   If I'm poor, he's going to feed me.
[00:33:31.940 --> 00:33:36.740]   But Jesus said he did all of that to show us that he had authority to forgive us of
[00:33:36.740 --> 00:33:38.940]   our sins.
[00:33:38.940 --> 00:33:40.620]   Because it wasn't because of our lameness.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:42.260]   It wasn't because of our blindness.
[00:33:42.260 --> 00:33:45.000]   It wasn't because of our empty stomachs.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.020]   It was because of our sins.
[00:33:49.020 --> 00:33:52.780]   But they did not understand.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:56.840]   And as a result, they rejected him.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:03.420]   The very person and the only person that could truly give them life.
[00:34:03.420 --> 00:34:08.620]   You know, among the Jews there are four different groups.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:12.260]   The Essenes you don't see in the Bible.
[00:34:12.260 --> 00:34:14.460]   Because they just dropped out.
[00:34:14.460 --> 00:34:15.460]   We don't want to deal with this.
[00:34:15.460 --> 00:34:18.900]   You know, we've been waiting for him and dealing with the Romans and the Pharisees.
[00:34:18.900 --> 00:34:23.420]   And so they just packed up their bags and they went out to the desert and lived in a
[00:34:23.420 --> 00:34:24.420]   cave.
[00:34:24.420 --> 00:34:27.640]   So they don't even know the Messiah came.
[00:34:27.640 --> 00:34:29.900]   They don't know because they're out there.
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:33.180]   There's people like that in our generation.
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:36.340]   They've neither rejected Christ nor are they passionately following Christ.
[00:34:36.340 --> 00:34:37.340]   They're just like, you know, I just don't know.
[00:34:37.340 --> 00:34:38.340]   I don't want to deal with it.
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.600]   And they're just going to live their life.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   That was the Essenes.
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.780]   So we don't know much about them because they're not in the Bible.
[00:34:43.780 --> 00:34:47.180]   Because they're out in the desert.
[00:34:47.180 --> 00:34:49.700]   And then we have the Sadducees.
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:54.180]   Sadducees were the people basically given up.
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.540]   It's been 700 years since the promise.
[00:34:57.540 --> 00:35:00.860]   Maybe this is all just wishful thinking.
[00:35:00.860 --> 00:35:02.500]   So they were the liberals who've given up.
[00:35:02.500 --> 00:35:03.580]   There's no angels.
[00:35:03.580 --> 00:35:04.740]   There's no resurrection.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:07.180]   There's no miracles.
[00:35:07.180 --> 00:35:10.580]   Sad thing about the Sadducees were they're the ones who were the leading Israel at the
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:12.260]   time.
[00:35:12.260 --> 00:35:14.160]   They were the high priests.
[00:35:14.160 --> 00:35:16.460]   They were the members in the Sanhedrin.
[00:35:16.460 --> 00:35:20.060]   So when Jesus goes to the temple, it was the Sadducees who were running the temple.
[00:35:20.060 --> 00:35:23.540]   And that's why the outside, they were selling stuff and people couldn't even worship because
[00:35:23.540 --> 00:35:26.740]   to them worship was just something that you did.
[00:35:26.740 --> 00:35:27.740]   It just wasn't important.
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:28.740]   It's not real.
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:31.380]   Because they didn't believe that anymore.
[00:35:31.380 --> 00:35:33.820]   So they were salvaging whatever they had on their face.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:40.100]   So they were by name a Jew, but they didn't believe in any of that stuff.
[00:35:40.100 --> 00:35:47.100]   If you go to Europe today, where Christianity has been for over a thousand plus years, that's
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:49.180]   exactly what it looks like.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:55.220]   The leaders of the churches in Europe are people who've given up hope in Christ.
[00:35:55.220 --> 00:35:56.220]   They don't believe in the resurrection.
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:59.780]   They don't believe that Bible is God's word.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:02.900]   But yet they still have the signs up on the churches.
[00:36:02.900 --> 00:36:06.180]   But if you go in, they don't believe in any of that.
[00:36:06.180 --> 00:36:07.260]   So they're trying to salvage.
[00:36:07.260 --> 00:36:08.260]   You know what?
[00:36:08.260 --> 00:36:09.260]   Maybe we can be a good witness.
[00:36:09.260 --> 00:36:15.140]   Maybe we're good citizens and do good stuff and feed the poor and make this place a better
[00:36:15.140 --> 00:36:16.140]   life.
[00:36:16.140 --> 00:36:18.940]   That's exactly what the Sadducees were doing.
[00:36:18.940 --> 00:36:20.980]   Because they no longer believed in the miracle of God.
[00:36:20.980 --> 00:36:21.980]   These were the Sadducees.
[00:36:21.980 --> 00:36:25.980]   And then you had the Zealots.
[00:36:25.980 --> 00:36:27.300]   Zealots were, you know what?
[00:36:27.300 --> 00:36:28.300]   He's not coming.
[00:36:28.300 --> 00:36:32.100]   And I don't know when he's going to come, but we can't wait.
[00:36:32.100 --> 00:36:33.140]   So we're going to get ready.
[00:36:33.140 --> 00:36:34.700]   And so they were carrying around knives.
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:35.700]   And these are the guys.
[00:36:35.700 --> 00:36:43.660]   Remember when Pontius Pilate presented to the Jews, do you want Jesus, possibly the
[00:36:43.660 --> 00:36:48.700]   king of the Jews, or do you want Barabbas, the Zealot, who was caught in the middle of
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:52.620]   his insurrection to try to challenge us militarily?
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:55.060]   Remember what they all cried out?
[00:36:55.060 --> 00:36:57.980]   I prefer to have Zealot.
[00:36:57.980 --> 00:37:06.140]   I prefer to have him militarily striking than this man who fooled us for three years, pretending
[00:37:06.140 --> 00:37:11.300]   to be our Messiah, and then he can't even get out of your hand.
[00:37:11.300 --> 00:37:13.980]   He's actually going to just give in like that?
[00:37:13.980 --> 00:37:16.380]   We don't want that.
[00:37:16.380 --> 00:37:20.840]   Give us Barabbas.
[00:37:20.840 --> 00:37:25.820]   These were the guys who organized the army.
[00:37:25.820 --> 00:37:31.220]   And they went to battle with the Romans, and they come in, they crush them.
[00:37:31.220 --> 00:37:37.660]   So AD 70, Israel disappears because of these Zealots.
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:44.780]   The saddest of these groups are the Pharisees, because the Pharisees somehow convinced themselves
[00:37:44.780 --> 00:37:51.500]   that if they kept the law perfectly, that maybe then the Messiah would come.
[00:37:51.500 --> 00:37:54.500]   So on top of all the laws that they had, they added more laws.
[00:37:54.500 --> 00:37:56.060]   We're going to do this, and we're going to do that.
[00:37:56.060 --> 00:38:02.500]   And they practiced it probably better than most Christians today.
[00:38:02.500 --> 00:38:05.140]   They proselytized.
[00:38:05.140 --> 00:38:06.720]   They made disciples.
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:11.260]   They gave every little thing that they had, they gave to the temple.
[00:38:11.260 --> 00:38:12.740]   They memorized scripture.
[00:38:12.740 --> 00:38:19.060]   They prayed and fasted, some of them three times a week, because they believed that if
[00:38:19.060 --> 00:38:25.340]   they were righteous enough, that somehow God would show favor.
[00:38:25.340 --> 00:38:30.180]   The whole book of Romans was written to address these people.
[00:38:30.180 --> 00:38:37.560]   See, the whole purpose of the law was so that you would know why you need the Messiah.
[00:38:37.560 --> 00:38:41.580]   The whole book of the law was to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:48.040]   So at the end of that, you would be surrendered and beating your chest, like the tax collectors,
[00:38:48.040 --> 00:38:49.840]   and like the prostitutes.
[00:38:49.840 --> 00:38:55.560]   That whether you are a religious leader, whether you are a prostitute, when God is revealed,
[00:38:55.560 --> 00:39:00.820]   that they would be beating their chest.
[00:39:00.820 --> 00:39:05.480]   How can I get them to heaven?
[00:39:05.480 --> 00:39:11.440]   But they fooled themselves to think that if they kept the law, and the extra laws that
[00:39:11.440 --> 00:39:15.480]   they had, that they had a better standing before God.
[00:39:15.480 --> 00:39:22.200]   And when Jesus came, He rebuked them more than anybody else.
[00:39:22.200 --> 00:39:27.520]   Instead of humbling them, the law made them proud.
[00:39:27.520 --> 00:39:33.000]   And every single one of them rejected Christ because they projected on Him what they wanted
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:37.160]   the King to be.
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:47.160]   As we prepare for the resurrection, there's a glimpse of this in every single one of us.
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:51.060]   We want Him to fulfill certain things.
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:56.200]   Whatever frustration, whatever pain, whatever situation that we are in, why isn't God answering
[00:39:56.200 --> 00:39:58.220]   this prayer?
[00:39:58.220 --> 00:40:01.600]   If you would just fix my marriage, if you would just fix my kids, if you would just
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:05.640]   fix my relationship, if you would just fix my circumstance, if you would just fix my
[00:40:05.640 --> 00:40:08.100]   business.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:17.240]   And yet Jesus says, He who finds his life, He who lives hard, thinking that somehow if
[00:40:17.240 --> 00:40:22.240]   you do this, that you're going to have a better life, He said, we'll lose it.
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:27.360]   He who loses his life for my sake, He will find it.
[00:40:27.360 --> 00:40:35.120]   You see, our inclination to live is what's killing us.
[00:40:35.120 --> 00:40:40.100]   Our inclination to be successful is what kills us.
[00:40:40.100 --> 00:40:46.160]   Our inclination to be better than our neighbors is what kills us, is what divides us.
[00:40:46.160 --> 00:40:47.960]   It's what causes war.
[00:40:47.960 --> 00:40:49.960]   It's what causes divorce.
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:41:00.560]   It is until we die and we recognize that life is found in Him and Him alone.
[00:41:00.560 --> 00:41:08.880]   We could be blind just like the Jews and thinking that we're following Christ when we're really
[00:41:08.880 --> 00:41:14.640]   following the image that we've created of Him instead of the Christ of the Bible.
[00:41:14.640 --> 00:41:20.020]   So my prayer is that as we prepare ourselves for the Palm Sunday and for Good Friday and
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.880]   resurrection that it would be an opportunity for us to look deeply, not only the Word of
[00:41:24.880 --> 00:41:28.560]   God, but our own passions.
[00:41:28.560 --> 00:41:36.040]   Even as a pastor, even as I preach the gospel, my desire to be somebody can easily creep
[00:41:36.040 --> 00:41:39.960]   in and it will ruin me.
[00:41:39.960 --> 00:41:43.040]   So let's take some time to step back.
[00:41:43.040 --> 00:41:46.680]   Take the next three weeks to four weeks.
[00:41:46.680 --> 00:41:51.160]   Before we examine the world, before we examine the church, examine our own hearts.
[00:41:51.160 --> 00:41:52.160]   Where are we?
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:54.440]   Am I truly following Christ?
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:57.160]   Is there any blindness in me?
[00:41:57.160 --> 00:42:02.080]   Hopefully that will bring revival and refreshment in our hearts as we meet the Lord.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:08.320]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads.
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:18.040]   Father, we come before you needing your grace again and again.
[00:42:18.040 --> 00:42:25.040]   Lord, I know we have brothers and sisters in this room even now are wrestling in prayer,
[00:42:25.040 --> 00:42:31.480]   dealing with hurt and pain, disappointment of living in this world.
[00:42:31.480 --> 00:42:36.800]   Open our eyes, Lord God, that we may see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, that
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:40.280]   our hope will be placed in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:42:40.280 --> 00:42:47.160]   Lord, help us, Lord God, to see who Christ is, that the groaning in our hearts, Lord
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:55.160]   God, would cause us to be justified, sanctified, ultimately glorified.
[00:42:55.160 --> 00:43:02.200]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:43:02.200 --> 00:43:03.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
