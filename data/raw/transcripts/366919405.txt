[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.760]   Alright God, we pray Lord that you would day to day grant to us your spiritual strength.
[00:00:12.760 --> 00:00:20.240]   God, I know that a lot of us Lord after a full day's work come in and try to do Bible
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:21.720]   study.
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:26.360]   We love it, at the same time Lord sometimes we're in fatigue.
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:31.520]   And what's more, we absolutely need perseverance because God we want to not just simply do
[00:00:31.520 --> 00:00:35.600]   this week to week, but we want to apply what we're learning.
[00:00:35.600 --> 00:00:43.720]   To exercise our faith in the eternity you promise, to exercise our faith in preaching
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:49.720]   that the kingdom to come, to exercise our faith to fight our flesh, and what's more
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:54.800]   God to continue Lord to live according to what you've shown us.
[00:00:54.800 --> 00:00:59.400]   And we recognize God that requires so much spiritual strength.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:04.760]   And so we pray Lord that you would grant to us God your conviction, that you grant to
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:10.360]   us awareness of your spirit, and what's more you would grant to us just a recollection,
[00:01:10.360 --> 00:01:16.840]   a remembrance of your word that day to day God we might walk abiding by your truth.
[00:01:16.840 --> 00:01:21.480]   And especially Lord as we have been walking through the book of Philippians, there's so
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:27.120]   much Father God that challenges our faith of how we view the entire world.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.760]   And I pray for the exact same thing tonight, that as we study your word you would challenge
[00:01:32.760 --> 00:01:38.520]   our world view, our value system, how we assess and judge everything.
[00:01:38.520 --> 00:01:44.840]   God we thank you it's in Christ name we pray, amen.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:51.240]   Now, before we jump into just reading the passage and going forward, I want to do a
[00:01:51.240 --> 00:01:55.120]   quick introductory comment there.
[00:01:55.120 --> 00:02:00.360]   Remember that all that Apostle Paul is saying to some degree connects.
[00:02:00.360 --> 00:02:04.720]   Sometimes especially here he will transition and say, you know what finally this and then
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:06.840]   he'll move.
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:12.120]   Sometimes you know in some of these epistles he'll give a large section of doctrinal teaching.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.400]   You know this is the truth about eternity, this is the truth about gospel of Jesus, and
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.400]   then he'll move into exhortation and say therefore, right?
[00:02:21.400 --> 00:02:27.880]   With Philippians what's really clear is that his mentality, the faith as to which he is
[00:02:27.880 --> 00:02:33.120]   interpreting all of his life circumstances including his imprisonment, including the
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:36.200]   suffering is evident through his teaching.
[00:02:36.200 --> 00:02:41.640]   And recall that in chapter one Apostle Paul had this hope, this faith, and he said this
[00:02:41.640 --> 00:02:46.440]   is his inner desire, sorry, earnest expectation and hope that I will not be put to shame in
[00:02:46.440 --> 00:02:52.240]   anything but that with all boldness Christ will even now as always be exalted in my body
[00:02:52.240 --> 00:02:54.360]   whether by life or by death.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:58.840]   For to me to live is Christ and to die is gain.
[00:02:58.840 --> 00:03:06.760]   Now as we think about what he says there, he says this particular privilege to have
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:14.400]   Christ be modeled, to have Christ be shown, to have Christ be the explanation of all that
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:17.680]   we're going through, that's to him his great joy.
[00:03:17.680 --> 00:03:21.320]   And what he says is I want you to have that joy with me, right?
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:28.720]   And he talked about how he wanted us to make his joy complete by being united yes, but
[00:03:28.720 --> 00:03:37.280]   also he said join my endeavor, rejoice with me, share my joy which meant actually do what
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:42.040]   he's doing, sacrifice to expend himself.
[00:03:42.040 --> 00:03:46.080]   It was a euphemism almost to say endure the suffering with me for the sake of Christ and
[00:03:46.080 --> 00:03:51.960]   the exaltation of Christ, join with me in this amazing privilege of magnifying and glorifying
[00:03:51.960 --> 00:03:54.120]   Christ, right?
[00:03:54.120 --> 00:04:00.520]   And so what we saw last week were two model examples of that in Timothy and in Paphroditus,
[00:04:00.520 --> 00:04:01.520]   right?
[00:04:01.520 --> 00:04:04.320]   And then so that was the last week.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.080]   Here he picks up the idea again and then now we're going to walk through the passage a
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:10.080]   little bit, okay?
[00:04:10.080 --> 00:04:17.120]   With the command a summary saying finally rejoice in the Lord.
[00:04:17.120 --> 00:04:22.240]   That is your main command in verses 1 through 11.
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:27.480]   So what that means is the rest of the passage that's talking about the bewares and the example
[00:04:27.480 --> 00:04:34.000]   even of his own potential bragging rights and then how he sees Christ, all of that is
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.320]   in the context of commanding you rejoice, right?
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:40.040]   Rejoice with me.
[00:04:40.040 --> 00:04:45.560]   And it still then has the sentiment, it still has the residual sound of Apostle Paul saying
[00:04:45.560 --> 00:04:49.260]   do you understand where I'm placing my joy?
[00:04:49.260 --> 00:04:55.040]   It's upon Christ, not my circumstances, not an eager expectation that I'm going to be
[00:04:55.040 --> 00:05:02.480]   free from jail, not this great hope that all things give it time and will go right, but
[00:05:02.480 --> 00:05:09.240]   it's his desire that Christ would be exalted either in his body now or even in his death,
[00:05:09.240 --> 00:05:10.240]   right?
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:11.240]   Okay.
[00:05:11.240 --> 00:05:14.960]   As we think about that, I'm going to walk through this passage together with you guys
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:18.440]   and then we'll take each section together.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:24.440]   So what he says is finally my brethren rejoice in the Lord, to write the same thing again
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.880]   is no trouble for me and it is a safeguard to you.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.000]   What I want to say there is I put that in parentheses because Apostle Paul gives a bit
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:38.280]   of his own kind of parenthetical thought as to why he's repeating the same concept over
[00:05:38.280 --> 00:05:42.960]   and over again and what he's saying is this is to guard you, okay?
[00:05:42.960 --> 00:05:48.420]   And so he says beware of the dogs, beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision,
[00:05:48.420 --> 00:05:54.360]   for we are the true circumcision who worship in the spirit of God and glory in Christ Jesus
[00:05:54.360 --> 00:05:58.280]   and put no confidence in the flesh.
[00:05:58.280 --> 00:06:04.480]   So what I'm saying is the command is rejoice in the Lord, he wants to safeguard you and
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:09.160]   so that rejoicing in the Lord is going to guard you from this, whatever the dogs, the
[00:06:09.160 --> 00:06:13.300]   evil workers, and the false circumcision are trying to do to you, right?
[00:06:13.300 --> 00:06:20.560]   And what he says is we're the true circumcision and so here I highlight for you the main command
[00:06:20.560 --> 00:06:23.360]   and what I show you is there is this contrast.
[00:06:23.360 --> 00:06:28.740]   There is going to be these, the efforts of, I'm just going to say the evil doers, right?
[00:06:28.740 --> 00:06:34.800]   The evil doers who are trying to influence the community and Apostle Paul saying look,
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:40.200]   we have the spirit of God and the glory of Christ, we're the true circumcision.
[00:06:40.200 --> 00:06:45.500]   From here, the next passage is really him giving a rationale, right?
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:51.420]   And the way he gives this rationale is by doing a self-example because even for me,
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:55.460]   if I were to buy into the system of the evil doers, I have tons.
[00:06:55.460 --> 00:07:00.440]   He says in verse 4, although I myself might have confidence even in the flesh, if anyone
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:05.220]   else has a mind to put confidence in the flesh, I far more.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:09.500]   Circumcised the eighth day of the nation of Israel, of the tribe of the Benjamin, the
[00:07:09.500 --> 00:07:14.300]   Hebrew of Hebrews as to the law of Pharisee as to zeal of persecutor of the church as
[00:07:14.300 --> 00:07:18.580]   to righteousness which is in the law found blameless.
[00:07:18.580 --> 00:07:22.240]   But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted as loss for the sake
[00:07:22.240 --> 00:07:23.620]   of Christ.
[00:07:23.620 --> 00:07:29.020]   More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:07:29.020 --> 00:07:35.700]   Christ Jesus my Lord for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but
[00:07:35.700 --> 00:07:36.700]   rubbish.
[00:07:36.700 --> 00:07:41.980]   And what he's doing there then is just as he just a moment ago contrasted false circumcision
[00:07:41.980 --> 00:07:49.740]   to circumcision, he's using himself as a self-example, flesh, false confidence, true confidence,
[00:07:49.740 --> 00:07:50.980]   Christ.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:51.980]   Okay?
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:56.940]   Now, from there, what I like to do is just the last portion of it then, Apostle Paul
[00:07:56.940 --> 00:07:59.020]   gives the goal or the purpose.
[00:07:59.020 --> 00:08:05.620]   And he says, "So that I may gain Christ and may be found in him, not having a righteousness
[00:08:05.620 --> 00:08:10.580]   of my own derived from the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.620]   which comes from God on the basis of faith.
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:18.500]   That I may know him and the power of his resurrection and the fellowship of his suffering being
[00:08:18.500 --> 00:08:24.700]   conformed to his death in order that I may attain to the resurrection from the dead."
[00:08:24.700 --> 00:08:25.700]   Okay.
[00:08:25.700 --> 00:08:30.180]   Now, I walk through the passage together with you guys because it's good to just review
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.540]   the chunk as a whole.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:33.380]   It is a little bit of a larger chunk.
[00:08:33.380 --> 00:08:37.540]   Eleven verses is quite a lot when you're doing inductive Bible study, right?
[00:08:37.540 --> 00:08:40.900]   But I want to walk through that with you and on your packet, I delineated it like that
[00:08:40.900 --> 00:08:47.700]   because in Apostle Paul's writing, sometimes it may feel like there is a disconnect.
[00:08:47.700 --> 00:08:51.860]   Like, why in the world would he be like, "Look at, I love Timothy.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:52.860]   I love Epaphroditus.
[00:08:52.860 --> 00:08:54.080]   They've been so good.
[00:08:54.080 --> 00:08:55.080]   You know they've been good.
[00:08:55.080 --> 00:08:56.080]   Beware of the dogs."
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.080]   Right?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:09:00.680]   Like, it's just so disjointed.
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.800]   But actually what he's doing is, there is this thought of rejoicing in the Lord that
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:07.940]   explains everything.
[00:09:07.940 --> 00:09:09.260]   Right?
[00:09:09.260 --> 00:09:13.440]   And if there were these two individuals he brought up, those two individuals were models
[00:09:13.440 --> 00:09:17.900]   because by faith, they had Christ's attitude.
[00:09:17.900 --> 00:09:19.060]   Right?
[00:09:19.060 --> 00:09:21.440]   They had Apostle Paul's attitude.
[00:09:21.440 --> 00:09:23.880]   They were rejoicing in future hope.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:25.720]   They had the attitude of Christ.
[00:09:25.720 --> 00:09:28.840]   They saw what was truly valuable.
[00:09:28.840 --> 00:09:32.360]   And so he comes back and says, "In summary, finally, I'm telling you, rejoice.
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:34.320]   Again, I'm telling you this."
[00:09:34.320 --> 00:09:35.320]   Why?
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.080]   Because yes, there are things, horrible things.
[00:09:37.080 --> 00:09:39.460]   They're in a situation where they're being persecuted.
[00:09:39.460 --> 00:09:42.960]   The whole church is being persecuted, not just Apostle Paul.
[00:09:42.960 --> 00:09:45.240]   Do they need to make sense of that?
[00:09:45.240 --> 00:09:46.240]   Absolutely.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:50.120]   And so what Apostle Paul's going to do is going to give them this challenge again.
[00:09:50.120 --> 00:09:54.960]   I'm trying to safeguard you, not just by telling you like, "Don't worry.
[00:09:54.960 --> 00:09:55.960]   Hang in there a little bit more.
[00:09:55.960 --> 00:09:56.960]   It's going to be all right."
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:02.160]   But he's actually trying to give them what is true encouragement.
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:06.520]   So this is, again, an outline that I've made.
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.840]   It doesn't always have to look like this.
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:13.040]   But what I found was that there was a clear command that kind of directed the rest of
[00:10:13.040 --> 00:10:15.680]   the passage, which was rejoice in the Lord.
[00:10:15.680 --> 00:10:19.440]   And this, rejoicing in the Lord, is your safeguard.
[00:10:19.440 --> 00:10:23.640]   To all the hard scenarios you're experiencing, this is your safeguard.
[00:10:23.640 --> 00:10:30.560]   And then within that, he says, "Beware of the dogs who want you to glory in the flesh."
[00:10:30.560 --> 00:10:36.520]   People who do not have faith in the eternal, faith in the eternal God, are going to glory
[00:10:36.520 --> 00:10:41.440]   in whatever they have, and the totality of what they have is their flesh.
[00:10:41.440 --> 00:10:46.480]   The totality of all you have is all you have, which is, for the unbeliever, all you have
[00:10:46.480 --> 00:10:47.480]   is this life.
[00:10:47.480 --> 00:10:52.440]   So you're going to eat, be merry, and then you're going to pass, right?
[00:10:52.440 --> 00:10:58.840]   In fighting that, verse 7 through 8 says, "All gain is rubbish compared to Christ."
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:03.440]   To rejoice in Christ is to see the value of Christ.
[00:11:03.440 --> 00:11:04.960]   And that's what he's going to say.
[00:11:04.960 --> 00:11:08.680]   And then verse 9 through 11 is going to be, "The purpose of all this, then, is Christ
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.040]   all the way."
[00:11:10.040 --> 00:11:16.240]   All the experiences, the power of his resurrection, future glory, resurrection, all of that, all
[00:11:16.240 --> 00:11:17.240]   Christ, okay?
[00:11:17.240 --> 00:11:18.240]   All right.
[00:11:18.240 --> 00:11:22.440]   So that's the outline, an overview for you.
[00:11:22.440 --> 00:11:26.520]   Because it's a longer passage, we're going to break it down into four sections and cover
[00:11:26.520 --> 00:11:28.080]   it now.
[00:11:28.080 --> 00:11:29.400]   Okay.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:37.120]   So here, in section 1, I call it, "This is your safeguard," right?
[00:11:37.120 --> 00:11:39.220]   This is your safeguard.
[00:11:39.220 --> 00:11:44.120]   And the reason why I did this is because I found it really interesting that, yes, Apostle
[00:11:44.120 --> 00:11:50.440]   Paul is coming back to this idea, and then he's exhorting them through way of command,
[00:11:50.440 --> 00:11:52.440]   and then he's giving a rationale for it.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:54.480]   And previously, he gave examples for it.
[00:11:54.480 --> 00:12:00.120]   So I mean, to say that the book of Philippians is about you rejoicing in Christ is like an
[00:12:00.120 --> 00:12:01.560]   understatement, right?
[00:12:01.560 --> 00:12:05.280]   It's such a main, emphatic theme.
[00:12:05.280 --> 00:12:11.480]   But to appreciate that, I was thinking of that question that I asked you, how is causing
[00:12:11.480 --> 00:12:15.400]   somebody to be rejoicing in Christ an actual safeguard for them?
[00:12:15.400 --> 00:12:21.920]   In what way is it going to be an actual encouragement, a bolstering, a strengthening to say, "You
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:24.880]   know, you got to rejoice in Christ."
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.520]   I mean, sometimes I worry, when you say lofty statements like that, let's say someone's
[00:12:28.520 --> 00:12:31.880]   having a hard day, they come and they pour out their heart to you, and it's like, "You
[00:12:31.880 --> 00:12:33.240]   don't know what happened today."
[00:12:33.240 --> 00:12:37.480]   And then they start to, you know, be vulnerable and reveal everything, and then you're like,
[00:12:37.480 --> 00:12:41.800]   "You know, you just really got to rejoice in Christ," right?
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:46.920]   Don't you sometimes fear saying that because you fear sounding cliche?
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:51.160]   You almost fear the response of like, "Sure, of course," right?
[00:12:51.160 --> 00:12:54.320]   Throwing that, you know, cliche terms around again.
[00:12:54.320 --> 00:13:01.520]   But Apostle Paul is absolutely convinced that is their safeguard, even to a specific scenario
[00:13:01.520 --> 00:13:08.640]   where clearly there are either false teachers, bad influences, distractions, maybe even an
[00:13:08.640 --> 00:13:13.600]   entire culture that is trying to dissuade them, yes?
[00:13:13.600 --> 00:13:16.440]   To that, Apostle Paul's answer is, "You know what you guys need?
[00:13:16.440 --> 00:13:17.720]   Let me give you a plan."
[00:13:17.720 --> 00:13:23.000]   Apostle Paul's actual encouragement to them is, safeguard to them, "You need to be so
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:25.440]   centered on Christ," right?
[00:13:25.440 --> 00:13:28.160]   "You're rejoicing in Christ is to be your safeguard."
[00:13:28.160 --> 00:13:31.440]   And I started thinking, what kind of example can I give to this?
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:33.560]   And I started thinking about grandparents.
[00:13:33.560 --> 00:13:37.280]   You know, when I see grandparents dealing with little kids, it's pretty hilarious.
[00:13:37.280 --> 00:13:42.360]   For example, you know, we had a little family gathering, and then there's this -- I have
[00:13:42.360 --> 00:13:44.360]   a little niece, she's like the cutest little thing.
[00:13:44.360 --> 00:13:46.360]   She's Kaylee, she's like two years old.
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.800]   And you know when little babies, like, they don't get what they want, immediately they
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.800]   cry and they go, "Bah!"
[00:13:51.800 --> 00:13:52.800]   You know?
[00:13:52.800 --> 00:13:57.080]   Now, parents were sitting there like, "Oh my gosh, what a drama baby," you know?
[00:13:57.080 --> 00:13:59.080]   And when they see that, they're like, "Who did it?"
[00:13:59.080 --> 00:14:00.080]   Right?
[00:14:00.080 --> 00:14:01.080]   Like, "Was it him?
[00:14:01.080 --> 00:14:02.080]   Was it Appa?"
[00:14:02.080 --> 00:14:03.080]   And then they start like, "Mama," right?
[00:14:03.080 --> 00:14:05.360]   And have you ever seen grandparents do that?
[00:14:05.360 --> 00:14:10.240]   They'll actually discipline somebody to make baby feel better.
[00:14:10.240 --> 00:14:14.600]   Or like baby cries because they didn't get a sweet treat or whatever, and it's just like,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:15.600]   "Oh, what do you want?"
[00:14:15.600 --> 00:14:19.520]   They just literally shove everything the parents are like trying to, you know, control, they
[00:14:19.520 --> 00:14:22.440]   like shove it in their mouth, it's like, "No, eat this, eat this, eat this."
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.440]   And people are sitting there like, "Oh my goodness, you're going to spoil this baby,"
[00:14:25.440 --> 00:14:26.440]   right?
[00:14:26.440 --> 00:14:31.160]   And I bring this example up is because what's really interesting about all that philosophy
[00:14:31.160 --> 00:14:32.960]   is to say, "You know what?
[00:14:32.960 --> 00:14:36.560]   Because this baby is crying, the world is wrong.
[00:14:36.560 --> 00:14:37.560]   Someone is fault.
[00:14:37.560 --> 00:14:38.560]   They don't have enough food."
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.920]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:14:40.920 --> 00:14:43.580]   And that's not so far from adults.
[00:14:43.580 --> 00:14:48.600]   When we have difficulties, our immediate thing typically is like, "This world is messed up
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:50.760]   and that person is to blame," right?
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:52.560]   Like we do this.
[00:14:52.560 --> 00:14:56.360]   And what's more, we will very readily complain, "I don't have this, I don't have that," and
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.040]   we find our solutions in the circumstance.
[00:15:00.040 --> 00:15:05.960]   Whereas Apostle Paul now is going to say, "No, I want to build you up in the inner man,
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.040]   in the inner person, in the inner faith.
[00:15:10.040 --> 00:15:16.040]   Your happiness and joy is never going to come from just all your circumstances being rectified,
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:23.400]   but rather there is going to be an immovable joy that I will give to you, rejoicing Christ,"
[00:15:23.400 --> 00:15:24.400]   right?
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:25.760]   That's what Apostle Paul is trying to do.
[00:15:25.760 --> 00:15:34.960]   And so when he says, "This is to your safeguard," there is an immediate challenge to you.
[00:15:34.960 --> 00:15:41.040]   Pastor Peter on Sunday, this past Sunday, man, very emphatically he asked this question
[00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:43.360]   to the church.
[00:15:43.360 --> 00:15:46.320]   Your circumstances are going to readily change to your life.
[00:15:46.320 --> 00:15:47.320]   You know this.
[00:15:47.320 --> 00:15:52.240]   Every season, whenever you go through graduations, you go through major life changes, even certain
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:53.800]   moves.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.640]   There is going to be a question within those things, very few of your preferences are going
[00:15:58.640 --> 00:16:00.680]   to be met.
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:03.520]   The question was, "Is Christ enough?"
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:06.560]   Do you have this immovable joy?
[00:16:06.560 --> 00:16:10.360]   Because no matter the circumstance, you have plenty.
[00:16:10.360 --> 00:16:17.840]   Beyond plenty, you have what can produce in your heart incredible, satisfactory joy.
[00:16:17.840 --> 00:16:19.840]   And that should be Christ to us.
[00:16:19.840 --> 00:16:20.840]   Amen?
[00:16:20.840 --> 00:16:23.680]   So that's where Apostle Paul is going.
[00:16:23.680 --> 00:16:32.040]   And then he says, okay, then in section two, along with that, "Then beware of the dogs,
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:36.560]   beware of the evil workers, beware of the false circumcision."
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.600]   Now I asked you this question, okay?
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:47.080]   So as we think about the safeguard, there's more to think about that there is, yes, negative,
[00:16:47.080 --> 00:16:50.320]   dangerous influences that potentially can come our way.
[00:16:50.320 --> 00:16:55.520]   I mean, he says it in a kind of a very interesting way, "Beware of dogs."
[00:16:55.520 --> 00:16:56.520]   It's pretty emphatic.
[00:16:56.520 --> 00:17:01.560]   So whenever you see that, you should take note of, one, there's a list, yes?
[00:17:01.560 --> 00:17:03.440]   And our group had a great discussion.
[00:17:03.440 --> 00:17:05.560]   We had some questions floating out there.
[00:17:05.560 --> 00:17:11.680]   Do dogs, evil workers, and false circumcision, do they represent like different categories
[00:17:11.680 --> 00:17:14.040]   of people and bad influences?
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:18.760]   Are they like one group of people that are just really, really heinous?
[00:17:18.760 --> 00:17:19.760]   Stuff like that.
[00:17:19.760 --> 00:17:25.800]   And I'm not going to get to all that now, but clearly there are these individuals who
[00:17:25.800 --> 00:17:30.160]   are false, contrast to the true believers.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:34.160]   Now, the question I asked you was, who are we supposed to be aware of?
[00:17:34.160 --> 00:17:40.160]   Who are we supposed to look out for and make sure that we are in a sober, sober sight of
[00:17:40.160 --> 00:17:41.960]   their dangerous influences?
[00:17:41.960 --> 00:17:45.100]   And one of the things I asked was, you definitely have to look at the context.
[00:17:45.100 --> 00:17:50.340]   So in chapter two, I'm sorry, starting from verse two, there are several indicators that
[00:17:50.340 --> 00:17:54.100]   can show us what type of people that we're talking about.
[00:17:54.100 --> 00:17:59.140]   And we are talking about, yes, very first giveaway is the term false circumcision.
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:05.380]   If you compare different translations, another translation will say mutilator of the flesh,
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:06.380]   right?
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:12.940]   Because the Greek term there is actually literally mutilation, self-harm, okay?
[00:18:12.940 --> 00:18:17.940]   And when we think about that, we go on and say, in contrast, we are the true circumcision
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:22.020]   who worship the spirit of God versus, let's say, external, right?
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:26.540]   We're worshiping in the spirit versus whatever they're influencing is an external.
[00:18:26.540 --> 00:18:32.300]   What's more, for us, we put our confidence in the glory of Christ and put no confidence
[00:18:32.300 --> 00:18:33.620]   in the flesh.
[00:18:33.620 --> 00:18:37.580]   And then even when he's giving the example of himself, he talks about the confidence
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:42.740]   of the flesh, circumcised the eighth day, nation of Israel, tribe of Benjamin, Hebrew
[00:18:42.740 --> 00:18:48.180]   of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisees, zeal of persecutor of the church, and as to the
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:51.420]   righteousness which is in the law found blameless.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:57.260]   Now on that laundry list of accomplishments, who would that impress?
[00:18:57.260 --> 00:18:58.620]   Right?
[00:18:58.620 --> 00:19:02.460]   Right, the Judaizers, Jewish community.
[00:19:02.460 --> 00:19:08.780]   And what I'd like you to remember is within certain contexts, the pressure, the cultural
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:13.420]   pressure was so strong, right?
[00:19:13.420 --> 00:19:16.220]   You know what's really interesting is a long time ago back in college, I went to a mission
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.800]   trip to Romania.
[00:19:17.800 --> 00:19:22.960]   The Orthodox Church has so much control over the society, you couldn't get married outside
[00:19:22.960 --> 00:19:24.380]   of the Orthodox Church.
[00:19:24.380 --> 00:19:27.420]   You couldn't bury a family member outside of the Orthodox Church.
[00:19:27.420 --> 00:19:30.780]   A lot of, if foreigners came and they had translations, do you know who would do the
[00:19:30.780 --> 00:19:31.780]   translations?
[00:19:31.780 --> 00:19:33.300]   It's typically the priests.
[00:19:33.300 --> 00:19:39.820]   So not only in terms of family, not only in terms of certain important things, your whole
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:44.220]   kind of general life, it goes through the church.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:48.140]   Now think about this in this kind of culture, the pressures.
[00:19:48.140 --> 00:19:51.220]   Whenever you had a baby, they had rituals for that, right?
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:56.060]   Whenever you had, they had annual ceremonies, your daily like, the commerce went through
[00:19:56.060 --> 00:19:57.060]   that.
[00:19:57.060 --> 00:20:02.020]   So the merchants, who are controlling the like the merchandise, almost the economy within
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.860]   the temple grounds.
[00:20:04.860 --> 00:20:09.540]   So I want you to think about that because even as a corollary to us, if there are certain
[00:20:09.540 --> 00:20:16.740]   things that are social norms, high level social pressures, do we have any of that?
[00:20:16.740 --> 00:20:19.500]   Of course, of course we do.
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:24.860]   When it comes to certain education, when it comes to wanting to live in a certain area,
[00:20:24.860 --> 00:20:30.300]   when it comes to certain family status, we have various things that we can point to as
[00:20:30.300 --> 00:20:31.300]   well.
[00:20:31.300 --> 00:20:35.660]   Now, just for the sake of time, I'm going to say, I'm going to highlight those things
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:41.700]   for you because it's important for us to know, yes, we're supposed to be aware and because
[00:20:41.700 --> 00:20:47.900]   of all these various points, clearly it is the Jewish influence, Judaizers, who are telling
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:53.540]   Christians you still have to do these things in order to be righteous and accepted by God.
[00:20:53.540 --> 00:20:59.460]   But the importance of that, what's the content, what's the content that's actually dangerous
[00:20:59.460 --> 00:21:01.700]   for you, right?
[00:21:01.700 --> 00:21:05.220]   Is because we are so, so prone.
[00:21:05.220 --> 00:21:13.980]   I mean, it's like in eight winanas to always selfishly and pridefully establish our own,
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:17.340]   to defend ourselves and preserve ourselves.
[00:21:17.340 --> 00:21:25.220]   We are so prone to want to make sure that there is some kind of merit for me.
[00:21:25.220 --> 00:21:27.780]   It's like innate in us.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:29.540]   And that pressure is so high.
[00:21:29.540 --> 00:21:32.620]   You think about people struggle to be accepted.
[00:21:32.620 --> 00:21:38.540]   You think about people struggle to have self-worth, their own value in the society.
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:45.220]   I mean, it just goes without saying, we absolutely on a universal level struggle with this stuff.
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:51.260]   What I want to highlight too is not only who are we supposed to be aware of, what are they
[00:21:51.260 --> 00:21:57.380]   trying to influence us with, but let's observe the contrast and its severity.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:05.660]   Because as we study that passage, I mean, for Apostle Paul, who was a prime Jewish individual,
[00:22:05.660 --> 00:22:11.180]   he was like a model candidate, to look at that and say, "Evildoers."
[00:22:11.180 --> 00:22:16.580]   To look at that and say, "Mutilators and dogs."
[00:22:16.580 --> 00:22:20.180]   That's kind of wild, right?
[00:22:20.180 --> 00:22:23.900]   I mean, it almost sounds like, I guess someone's bitter, right?
[00:22:23.900 --> 00:22:25.300]   That's the way you maybe think of it.
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:28.620]   Like, I guess you're really bitter about this, but that's not actually the case.
[00:22:28.620 --> 00:22:33.180]   He's actually using this to contrast two concepts.
[00:22:33.180 --> 00:22:37.300]   And the contrast that he's saying is, in comparison to what we do in the Spirit of God and what
[00:22:37.300 --> 00:22:43.460]   we have in the glory of Christ, yes, all of that which was previously seen as righteous
[00:22:43.460 --> 00:22:49.620]   acts, all of that which was previously seen as holy, sanctified living, Apostle Paul is
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:53.100]   saying, "No, those are evil.
[00:22:53.100 --> 00:22:55.020]   Those are things that are completely false."
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.300]   And I'm just going to leave it there.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:02.380]   We have to pay attention to the contrast because this passage has so much for us in terms of
[00:23:02.380 --> 00:23:09.140]   contrast between what we have in the Spirit of God versus what is only possible as a cap
[00:23:09.140 --> 00:23:10.700]   by our own flesh.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:11.860]   Okay.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:15.180]   So to expand on that, let's turn to the rationale of the self-example.
[00:23:15.180 --> 00:23:16.180]   Okay?
[00:23:16.180 --> 00:23:17.180]   All right.
[00:23:17.180 --> 00:23:23.780]   The rationale of the self-example is this.
[00:23:23.780 --> 00:23:29.580]   He says, "Although I myself have confidence even in the flesh, if anyone else has a mind
[00:23:29.580 --> 00:23:33.180]   to put confidence in the flesh, I have far more circumcised the eighth day, the nation
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:37.300]   of Israel, the tribe of Benjamin, the Hebrew of Hebrews, as to the law of Pharisee, as
[00:23:37.300 --> 00:23:41.700]   to zeal of persecutor of the church, as to righteousness, which is in the law, found
[00:23:41.700 --> 00:23:42.980]   blameless."
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:47.020]   And so he says, "But whatever things were gained to me, those things I have counted
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:49.140]   as lost for the sake of Christ.
[00:23:49.140 --> 00:23:53.940]   More than that, I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing value of knowing
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:24:00.700]   Christ Jesus, my Lord, for whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them but
[00:24:00.700 --> 00:24:01.700]   rubbish."
[00:24:01.700 --> 00:24:08.340]   What we have to see here is Apostle Paul's mentality, where he considers all things rubbish
[00:24:08.340 --> 00:24:10.500]   compared to Christ.
[00:24:10.500 --> 00:24:15.560]   And what I've highlighted for you there is whenever there is repetition in the passage,
[00:24:15.560 --> 00:24:17.540]   you know it's so important.
[00:24:17.540 --> 00:24:21.700]   And what's really interesting is he highlights and does an all-inclusive statement, "Whatever
[00:24:21.700 --> 00:24:27.780]   things were gained to me, those things from before, even the things like blamelessness,
[00:24:27.780 --> 00:24:36.460]   zeal, status, excellence, heritage, tradition, all those things he counts as lost, right?
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:38.260]   Everything he could possibly have.
[00:24:38.260 --> 00:24:44.580]   If there was anything that could be potentially even a bragging right, Apostle Paul says,
[00:24:44.580 --> 00:24:48.100]   "No, I count that as rubbish."
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:51.380]   Let's take a moment to think about that a little bit.
[00:24:51.380 --> 00:24:57.220]   As I show you this list of the various things that Apostle Paul could potentially brag about,
[00:24:57.220 --> 00:25:00.660]   do you see any corollary in your life?
[00:25:00.660 --> 00:25:05.900]   Are you one of those people where you're like, "You know, by personality I'm a perfectionist."
[00:25:05.900 --> 00:25:08.180]   I want to give you a warning.
[00:25:08.180 --> 00:25:13.220]   It could be your personality, it could be your pride that you want to brag about it.
[00:25:13.220 --> 00:25:15.140]   Could be, right?
[00:25:15.140 --> 00:25:20.140]   Could it be those of you who really pride yourself on being a moral individual?
[00:25:20.140 --> 00:25:22.420]   I play by the rules, right?
[00:25:22.420 --> 00:25:23.420]   Play by the book.
[00:25:23.420 --> 00:25:25.300]   I'm a good person.
[00:25:25.300 --> 00:25:28.900]   Could it be certain status that you're searching for?
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:30.900]   You want to be in a certain title.
[00:25:30.900 --> 00:25:36.780]   You could be doing the exact same work at your office, but you just want that title.
[00:25:36.780 --> 00:25:39.740]   You sometimes say like, "I don't know why it's so important to me."
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:41.540]   It just is.
[00:25:41.540 --> 00:25:43.740]   We know why.
[00:25:43.740 --> 00:25:51.820]   Because we all struggle with wanting some level of confidence in my flesh.
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:54.980]   I want to feel secure in my own skin.
[00:25:54.980 --> 00:25:58.900]   I want to be accepted the way I am.
[00:25:58.900 --> 00:26:01.100]   Do we wrestle with any of these things?
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.980]   Is there any corollary in our modern day?
[00:26:02.980 --> 00:26:04.940]   I would say probably yes.
[00:26:04.940 --> 00:26:05.940]   Right?
[00:26:05.940 --> 00:26:07.660]   Probably yes.
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.140]   But let's take a moment to think about that a little bit.
[00:26:10.140 --> 00:26:13.820]   What does he mean when he says, "These are a loss?"
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.980]   You know what's really interesting is not only does he repeat the term loss several
[00:26:17.980 --> 00:26:20.060]   times, so he says, "All things are a loss.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:21.820]   I counted these things a loss.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:23.580]   All these gains to me is a loss."
[00:26:23.580 --> 00:26:28.420]   He says, "I count all things rubbish."
[00:26:28.420 --> 00:26:32.340]   I'm sure if you guys have heard sermons about this passage, you guys have heard this Greek
[00:26:32.340 --> 00:26:35.380]   term, "Skubalon," right?
[00:26:35.380 --> 00:26:39.940]   And you guys have probably heard, "It means excrement," right?
[00:26:39.940 --> 00:26:41.660]   That's what it means.
[00:26:41.660 --> 00:26:43.900]   It literally means trash.
[00:26:43.900 --> 00:26:47.560]   It means the stuff that's supposed to be discarded.
[00:26:47.560 --> 00:26:51.260]   It was regularly used to reference poop.
[00:26:51.260 --> 00:26:56.300]   The whole idea is this is utterly trash, right?
[00:26:56.300 --> 00:27:02.340]   But then here's the struggle, because if we're honest, here's the struggle that we have.
[00:27:02.340 --> 00:27:06.860]   Apostle Paul is revealing to us a value system where he puts all these things, and we should
[00:27:06.860 --> 00:27:07.860]   count it.
[00:27:07.860 --> 00:27:08.860]   We should count it as a loss.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:14.580]   As a matter of fact, some of you guys in here, when you do a lateral comparison, meaning
[00:27:14.580 --> 00:27:18.620]   like, let's say we just took a survey, and then we started surveying how successful you
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:21.060]   are, you guys are really up there.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.780]   And that's not to shame you, and it's not to put you up on a pedestal, but you can objectively
[00:27:25.780 --> 00:27:29.860]   say when I compare somebody to myself, you could be better than me.
[00:27:29.860 --> 00:27:31.880]   You could be better than me at basketball.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:33.180]   You could be smarter than me.
[00:27:33.180 --> 00:27:36.220]   Better memory, better intellect, better looks.
[00:27:36.220 --> 00:27:39.180]   More accomplished through the however many years of your life.
[00:27:39.180 --> 00:27:43.220]   Those can be objective realities, yes?
[00:27:43.220 --> 00:27:49.300]   But to those things, the question is how do you currently judge that in value?
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:50.300]   Meaning this.
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:53.660]   Let me give you an example, okay?
[00:27:53.660 --> 00:28:01.100]   I think that sometimes we get into this weird situation in life where we look at some of
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:05.860]   the things that we've accomplished, and we could look at some of the things that we have.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:12.860]   And when we compare that to Christ, we're supposed to say, "Wow, look at the chasm,"
[00:28:12.860 --> 00:28:13.860]   right?
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:18.780]   This is here, and Christ is so large, so great, he's way over there, and trying to compare
[00:28:18.780 --> 00:28:21.900]   the two, it is a feeble task.
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:25.180]   It shouldn't even be on the same table.
[00:28:25.180 --> 00:28:30.740]   But in actuality, a lot of times our struggle is we compare the two, and then we do one
[00:28:30.740 --> 00:28:34.580]   of these things where it's like, "Well, gosh, I don't know."
[00:28:34.580 --> 00:28:36.860]   Have you guys ever been there?
[00:28:36.860 --> 00:28:40.860]   In an ideal situation, both are good.
[00:28:40.860 --> 00:28:44.460]   And if I had it my way, I would just have both, right?
[00:28:44.460 --> 00:28:50.340]   When you do a compare and contrast, the challenge here is not to simply see these things as
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:53.980]   mutually or like both good kind of things.
[00:28:53.980 --> 00:28:57.000]   He's saying one is actually detrimental.
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:00.780]   When he says something is a loss, it's not to say that, "Oh, gosh, it's just pale as
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:01.780]   in comparison."
[00:29:01.780 --> 00:29:03.780]   He actually means this is detrimental to me.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:05.180]   It's hurtful.
[00:29:05.180 --> 00:29:06.180]   It's non-salvageable.
[00:29:06.180 --> 00:29:09.460]   It's trash.
[00:29:09.460 --> 00:29:15.740]   And so that's what I meant earlier when I said, "Do you notice and see the intensity
[00:29:15.740 --> 00:29:19.660]   of the comparison?"
[00:29:19.660 --> 00:29:27.100]   When things are compared to Christ, they don't become, "Oh, yeah, nice things that I could
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.140]   carry along with me."
[00:29:29.140 --> 00:29:33.200]   They become weight and baggage.
[00:29:33.200 --> 00:29:37.360]   Especially in this specific context, Apostle Paul is saying, "You know, if I actually held
[00:29:37.360 --> 00:29:42.740]   on to my Hebrew of Hebrew stature, can you imagine if I actually held on to some of those
[00:29:42.740 --> 00:29:47.380]   things that I bragged about and saw it like some kind of badge of honor?"
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:50.260]   No, those aren't two good things.
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:53.340]   Those are actually two competing things.
[00:29:53.340 --> 00:29:56.160]   And sometimes we have to recognize that.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:04.180]   And so this passage to us is a massive paradigm shift, massive paradigm shift, right?
[00:30:04.180 --> 00:30:07.620]   It's how you are valuing and how are you judging.
[00:30:07.620 --> 00:30:12.780]   When you see things in your life that is competing with Christ, those things in your life that
[00:30:12.780 --> 00:30:18.860]   you feel like you just can't let go, once you realize that, how are you judging them?
[00:30:18.860 --> 00:30:22.260]   Are you sitting there saying, "You know, I just got to learn to live with...
[00:30:22.260 --> 00:30:25.180]   All I need is just a little bit more discipline."
[00:30:25.180 --> 00:30:29.900]   How are you judging and assessing where you are when you have things competing in your
[00:30:29.900 --> 00:30:32.500]   heart with Christ?
[00:30:32.500 --> 00:30:37.500]   That is at the core of what he's trying to show us is a value system.
[00:30:37.500 --> 00:30:41.340]   In order to press this home a little bit more, I started thinking about what are the various
[00:30:41.340 --> 00:30:43.820]   things that we do hold on to?
[00:30:43.820 --> 00:30:48.400]   You know, for guys, there's lust.
[00:30:48.400 --> 00:30:50.740]   For everybody, there's a lust for success.
[00:30:50.740 --> 00:30:52.420]   There's a lust for acceptance.
[00:30:52.420 --> 00:30:55.360]   There's a lust for wanting to be reputable.
[00:30:55.360 --> 00:30:56.360]   But there's more.
[00:30:56.360 --> 00:30:58.220]   Some of us have lust for material gain.
[00:30:58.220 --> 00:31:01.860]   Some of us have lust for honor and respect at home.
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:07.020]   Some of us have lust for pleasure and just being able to have leisure and peace in your
[00:31:07.020 --> 00:31:11.700]   life and some of us have lust for whatever it may be.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:14.140]   How in the world do you fight that?
[00:31:14.140 --> 00:31:18.820]   When your flesh is constant, when your mind is just so easily duped for those things,
[00:31:18.820 --> 00:31:21.500]   how do you fight that?
[00:31:21.500 --> 00:31:23.740]   That's what Paul is trying to teach us.
[00:31:23.740 --> 00:31:27.020]   You have to see the surpassing value of Christ.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:32.340]   Tonight, I didn't want to talk about how everything in your life is just simply rubbish.
[00:31:32.340 --> 00:31:40.580]   I wanted to make sure to highlight for you the point here is rejoice in Christ.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:49.380]   The point here is see, experience, be humbled by the incredible value of the Lord Jesus
[00:31:49.380 --> 00:31:54.580]   who is perfect in righteousness and is desiring to give you that righteousness.
[00:31:54.580 --> 00:32:00.620]   Who is absolutely sacrificial in love, intimate in character, compassionate in heart and He
[00:32:00.620 --> 00:32:03.820]   wants to give you His affection.
[00:32:03.820 --> 00:32:05.380]   Remember His prayer.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:08.260]   He wanted the love of God which He had.
[00:32:08.260 --> 00:32:14.060]   He said, "God, the love which you had for me, give to them."
[00:32:14.060 --> 00:32:16.860]   Jesus wants to give that to you.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.180]   That's perfect patience.
[00:32:19.180 --> 00:32:23.180]   All of that He wants you to have.
[00:32:23.180 --> 00:32:25.780]   I didn't know how else to make this even more emphatic so guess what?
[00:32:25.780 --> 00:32:30.300]   I used a little bit of arrow and stars on my PowerPoint.
[00:32:30.300 --> 00:32:35.660]   If we're going to get something from this passage, it's the command, rejoice.
[00:32:35.660 --> 00:32:37.940]   Rejoice in the value of our Lord.
[00:32:37.940 --> 00:32:42.260]   And unless you see that, I'm not sure how you're going to fight.
[00:32:42.260 --> 00:32:45.880]   Unless you have the surpassing value of Christ, I don't know how you're going to fight these
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.340]   things.
[00:32:47.340 --> 00:32:50.420]   Because by confession, how many of us have fallen?
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.380]   We've seen some of the idols in our heart.
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:54.620]   We've seen some of the things we hold on to.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:59.220]   How many times have we fallen to the exact same thing?
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:06.220]   So when Apostle Paul says, "This is to you, your safeguard," I believe it.
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:15.060]   Unless Christ is the overwhelming treasure, the greatest value, no little discipline,
[00:33:15.060 --> 00:33:19.540]   no little exercise of the mind, it's not going to work.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:26.660]   And so, Apostle Paul says, "This then to him is his great comparison.
[00:33:26.660 --> 00:33:29.980]   This to him, having the glory of Christ, is everything."
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:32.680]   And therefore, he desires it all.
[00:33:32.680 --> 00:33:38.900]   He desires that he will conclude, decisively conclude, that all things are rubbish.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:39.900]   Why?
[00:33:39.900 --> 00:33:42.700]   So that he will go with Christ all the way.
[00:33:42.700 --> 00:33:45.780]   That he might gain Christ and be maybe found in him.
[00:33:45.780 --> 00:33:49.660]   That he might not have any righteousness of his own, but the righteousness that comes
[00:33:49.660 --> 00:33:54.500]   through faith in Christ, the righteousness that comes from God on the basis of faith.
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:58.920]   And then he says, "That I might know him, that I might know the power of his resurrection,
[00:33:58.920 --> 00:34:04.700]   the fellowship of his suffering, being conformed to his death, in order that I may attain to
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:07.700]   the resurrection from the dead."
[00:34:07.700 --> 00:34:11.500]   We could camp out here and ask the question, "What does that mean, the power of his resurrection?
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.820]   What does that mean, the fellowship of his suffering?"
[00:34:13.820 --> 00:34:17.380]   I hope you have time to reflect on that, but I want to say this.
[00:34:17.380 --> 00:34:20.220]   You should think of this as a collective whole.
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:24.260]   Starting from, "So that I may gain Christ," and all the way to the verse 11, "In order
[00:34:24.260 --> 00:34:26.700]   that I may attain to the resurrection of the dead."
[00:34:26.700 --> 00:34:29.900]   All of that belongs together, right?
[00:34:29.900 --> 00:34:36.420]   Apostle Paul is saying, "I want to experience the full gamut, the goal and objective here.
[00:34:36.420 --> 00:34:40.500]   My purpose is to know Christ fully.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:46.460]   And no, there is no skip-biddy-bop, like just bypassing all this stuff to get to glory.
[00:34:46.460 --> 00:34:49.180]   I want to know Christ in everything.
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:51.540]   I want to know Christ in his full character.
[00:34:51.540 --> 00:34:55.140]   I want to know Christ in the power that he exercises.
[00:34:55.140 --> 00:35:00.140]   And so that's why I labeled this portion, "Christ All the Way."
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:06.820]   Again, I really pray that some of the things that we're learning about, I want to call
[00:35:06.820 --> 00:35:08.940]   it the lofty, right?
[00:35:08.940 --> 00:35:11.980]   That's major conceptual things.
[00:35:11.980 --> 00:35:16.880]   To have a rejoicing in Christ, a value system in Christ, all those conceptually are major
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.740]   worldview things.
[00:35:18.740 --> 00:35:24.500]   But the question is going to be for you, very specifically, especially in the moments where
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:30.660]   your heart is getting pulled to want and desire certain things to be realized in your life,
[00:35:30.660 --> 00:35:34.240]   are you able to draw a chart?
[00:35:34.240 --> 00:35:38.180]   This clearly is rubbish compared to Christ, right?
[00:35:38.180 --> 00:35:42.140]   And unless you see the surpassing value of the Lord, this chart is always going to be
[00:35:42.140 --> 00:35:43.300]   muddy.
[00:35:43.300 --> 00:35:49.300]   And so I pray that every time we're doing study, your own Bible reading, your own prayer,
[00:35:49.300 --> 00:35:53.740]   more and more we should be growing in an intimate, intimate knowledge of Christ.
[00:35:53.740 --> 00:36:02.460]   Let's take a moment to pray, and then you guys can jump into your discussion.
[00:36:02.460 --> 00:36:10.300]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you, God, because Lord, you are maturing us as your
[00:36:10.300 --> 00:36:11.300]   children.
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:16.940]   And we recognize, Father God, that you as our Father, you're not just simply doing minor
[00:36:16.940 --> 00:36:25.700]   tweaks in our lives, but God, you are fully in control, and yet in the midst of that,
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:32.420]   you're causing us to mature in our thought, in our understanding, and in our faith.
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:38.500]   And I hope, Lord, that every single one of us will be challenged to question, do we have
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:45.380]   a view of the great glory of Christ that we might understand who we have in the Lord?
[00:36:45.380 --> 00:36:50.260]   And what's more, I pray that if any of us here have not experienced what it means to,
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:55.540]   yes, struggle and wrestle in this life, to suffer and go through hardship, but ultimately
[00:36:55.540 --> 00:37:01.180]   to find true joy in knowing and serving our Lord, I pray, Father God, that they would
[00:37:01.180 --> 00:37:02.660]   look to you.
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:07.540]   And Father, we pray that even in the day-to-day, in the mundane, and even in, again, some of
[00:37:07.540 --> 00:37:12.380]   the fatigue, I do ask, Lord, that you would also grant to us this faith, God, that we
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.020]   would have surpassing joy in our Savior.
[00:37:15.020 --> 00:37:16.340]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:16.340]   Amen.
[00:37:16.340 --> 00:37:17.180]   Amen.
