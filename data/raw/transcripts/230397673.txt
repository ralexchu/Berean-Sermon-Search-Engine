[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   to all their own people near her, both good and bad.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.520]   Meanwhile, Nemesis hears of their plans
[00:00:08.520 --> 00:00:13.520]   and comes to planet Earth to be super, super duper bad.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   - Oh man, those Groots man, they sure almost got me.
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   But I can't believe I escaped them.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:42.320]   Those ginormous Groots gave me such a hoot.
[00:00:42.320 --> 00:00:43.400]   But you know what?
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:45.520]   Now that we're on planet Earth,
[00:00:45.520 --> 00:00:49.320]   I am going to get Captain Korp and score.
[00:00:49.320 --> 00:00:52.300]   (laughs)
[00:00:52.300 --> 00:00:55.300]   (children cheering)
[00:00:55.300 --> 00:01:12.580]   - Nice.
[00:01:12.580 --> 00:01:13.420]   - Nice.
[00:01:13.420 --> 00:01:14.740]   - There you go.
[00:01:14.740 --> 00:01:17.940]   - That was fun.
[00:01:17.940 --> 00:01:18.780]   - Wait.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:19.780]   - Oh, sorry.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:23.880]   - Wait, what are they doing?
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:27.980]   Weren't they trying to hurt him?
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.480]   Why are they playing together?
[00:01:30.480 --> 00:01:32.700]   - Okay, let's try again.
[00:01:32.700 --> 00:01:34.980]   - Why are they having fun together?
[00:01:34.980 --> 00:01:36.700]   - Ready, set, go.
[00:01:36.700 --> 00:01:39.040]   - I don't like this at all.
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.220]   I do not like this at all.
[00:01:41.220 --> 00:01:45.620]   - I'm so glad we can become friends and play together.
[00:01:45.620 --> 00:01:46.460]   - Yeah, we're Groot.
[00:01:46.460 --> 00:01:48.940]   - I never thought I'd be friends with you guys,
[00:01:48.940 --> 00:01:50.380]   but thank you for sharing the gospel with me,
[00:01:50.380 --> 00:01:51.220]   Korp and score.
[00:01:51.220 --> 00:01:52.140]   - Of course, it's cool.
[00:01:52.140 --> 00:01:53.780]   I mean, we all make mistakes,
[00:01:53.780 --> 00:01:56.780]   and as long as you understand you need to change and repent.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:04.700]   - Yeah, all my bad friends are super confused
[00:02:04.700 --> 00:02:06.060]   by how much I've changed.
[00:02:06.060 --> 00:02:07.140]   I mean, looking back,
[00:02:07.140 --> 00:02:09.840]   I can't believe all the evil things that I used to do.
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.060]   - You know what?
[00:02:12.060 --> 00:02:12.900]   It's okay.
[00:02:12.900 --> 00:02:14.300]   God understands that all of us make mistakes,
[00:02:14.300 --> 00:02:15.620]   we make wrong choices,
[00:02:15.620 --> 00:02:17.860]   and he still loves us even when we sin.
[00:02:17.860 --> 00:02:19.780]   - We're going to go get some yoga now.
[00:02:19.780 --> 00:02:22.220]   Do you guys want to come with us?
[00:02:22.220 --> 00:02:24.540]   - Actually, we have a meeting to go to
[00:02:24.540 --> 00:02:26.140]   called Villains Being Secretive,
[00:02:26.140 --> 00:02:28.100]   so yeah, we start when we can.
[00:02:28.100 --> 00:02:28.940]   - Okay.
[00:02:28.940 --> 00:02:29.780]   - We'll see you later.
[00:02:29.780 --> 00:02:30.600]   - See you later.
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:31.440]   - Bye.
[00:02:31.440 --> 00:02:32.280]   - Bye.
[00:02:32.280 --> 00:02:38.860]   - Nemesis didn't understand
[00:02:38.860 --> 00:02:41.740]   why they were being disobedient and evil,
[00:02:41.740 --> 00:02:44.420]   and so he decided, frustratingly,
[00:02:44.420 --> 00:02:47.860]   to attend the Villains Being Secretive meeting
[00:02:47.860 --> 00:02:50.540]   to ask some help.
[00:02:50.540 --> 00:02:53.540]   (audience laughing)
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:03:00.740]   - Guys, I don't understand.
[00:03:00.740 --> 00:03:03.500]   What are you doing?
[00:03:03.500 --> 00:03:07.380]   We are supposed to be enemies.
[00:03:07.380 --> 00:03:08.300]   En-ne-mies.
[00:03:08.300 --> 00:03:10.260]   E-n-n-ie.
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:12.900]   I enemy.
[00:03:12.900 --> 00:03:14.700]   They are enemies.
[00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   - Wait, why are they our enemies?
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:18.540]   - Huh.
[00:03:18.540 --> 00:03:21.540]   I don't know.
[00:03:21.540 --> 00:03:25.180]   - Can you at least just listen to us
[00:03:25.180 --> 00:03:27.540]   and hear what we learned at VBS?
[00:03:27.540 --> 00:03:29.220]   - No, I don't want to learn anything
[00:03:29.220 --> 00:03:30.860]   that you've learned at VBS.
[00:03:30.860 --> 00:03:33.620]   - Yeah, but it's good for you.
[00:03:33.620 --> 00:03:36.500]   Maybe you'll change and you won't be so evil.
[00:03:36.500 --> 00:03:38.820]   - Anger management issue?
[00:03:38.820 --> 00:03:42.780]   I don't have anger management issue.
[00:03:42.780 --> 00:03:44.100]   - Come on.
[00:03:44.100 --> 00:03:45.700]   Come on, Nemesis.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:47.500]   Okay, fine.
[00:03:47.500 --> 00:03:52.300]   I'll listen to what you've learned at this VBS.
[00:03:52.300 --> 00:03:54.180]   - All right, so,
[00:03:54.180 --> 00:03:56.980]   on day one, in the beginning,
[00:03:56.980 --> 00:04:01.900]   or, day one, we learned that God created us to love him.
[00:04:01.900 --> 00:04:05.660]   So, for me, I was very thankful for Corky's work
[00:04:05.660 --> 00:04:08.900]   for showing me that God created me to love him
[00:04:08.900 --> 00:04:13.900]   instead of brainwashing them for my evil desires.
[00:04:13.900 --> 00:04:14.860]   - Okay.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.260]   - On day two, we learned that God will still love us
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:21.100]   even when we make mistakes.
[00:04:21.100 --> 00:04:23.540]   I'm sorry that we beat up Cork and Spork,
[00:04:23.540 --> 00:04:26.500]   but more importantly, I'm sorry to God.
[00:04:26.500 --> 00:04:28.980]   Cork and Spork were the ones who shared the gospel with us
[00:04:28.980 --> 00:04:31.100]   and helped us see the light.
[00:04:31.100 --> 00:04:34.700]   - On day three, we learned that God sent his son to save us.
[00:04:34.700 --> 00:04:37.660]   I'm so glad that God sent Jesus
[00:04:37.660 --> 00:04:39.700]   to save us from our suffering.
[00:04:39.700 --> 00:04:43.900]   I'm so glad that, I know that God sent Cork and Spork
[00:04:43.900 --> 00:04:46.340]   to help us understand the gospel.
[00:04:46.340 --> 00:04:48.020]   - Okay, coffee.
[00:04:48.020 --> 00:04:53.020]   - On day four, we learned that God has a plan for Jesus.
[00:04:53.020 --> 00:04:57.500]   We learned...
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:05:05.420]   - Because we read the Bible,
[00:05:05.420 --> 00:05:08.340]   Julie understood how Jesus died for us,
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:10.340]   so we can wait for his second coming.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:13.940]   (audience murmuring)
[00:05:13.940 --> 00:05:14.780]   - You're right.
[00:05:14.780 --> 00:05:19.900]   I mean, maybe it was full time that I was wrong
[00:05:19.900 --> 00:05:21.340]   this whole time.
[00:05:21.340 --> 00:05:24.740]   Maybe I was evil.
[00:05:24.740 --> 00:05:27.740]   I mean, was I bad?
[00:05:27.740 --> 00:05:29.060]   What do you guys think?
[00:05:29.060 --> 00:05:31.940]   - Well, I mean, if you really do believe that you're evil
[00:05:31.940 --> 00:05:33.740]   and you feel sorry for it,
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:37.100]   well, we'll learn today in BBS on the last day
[00:05:37.100 --> 00:05:41.540]   that God sent us, or he promised us, a helper.
[00:05:41.540 --> 00:05:44.540]   - Wait, I think I've heard about that before.
[00:05:44.540 --> 00:05:46.380]   I might have heard you guys talking about that,
[00:05:46.380 --> 00:05:51.380]   that God sent a helper called the Holy,
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:55.020]   the Holy Spatula, I believe, or Sponge?
[00:05:55.020 --> 00:05:58.340]   - No, the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:58.340 --> 00:06:00.180]   - Oh, the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:00.180 --> 00:06:04.260]   - Yeah, all you have to do is repeat and believe.
[00:06:04.260 --> 00:06:07.380]   - God will forgive you and the Holy Spirit will guide you.
[00:06:07.380 --> 00:06:08.220]   - You're right.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:12.780]   You know, maybe I do believe.
[00:06:12.780 --> 00:06:16.660]   I mean, all right, I guess I do believe.
[00:06:16.660 --> 00:06:18.500]   First thing I have to tell you guys,
[00:06:18.500 --> 00:06:21.500]   I don't have an evil twin brother.
[00:06:21.500 --> 00:06:25.420]   Secondly, I do still have beautiful, nice skin.
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.860]   I mean, but you're right, I believe.
[00:06:28.860 --> 00:06:32.860]   I am sorry, everybody, for being evil.
[00:06:32.860 --> 00:06:35.220]   - Okay, be through with you,
[00:06:35.220 --> 00:06:37.860]   but most importantly, God forgives you.
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.340]   - All right, thanks, guys.
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:41.980]   - I'm through!
[00:06:41.980 --> 00:06:42.820]   - Through.
[00:06:42.820 --> 00:06:43.660]   - Through.
[00:06:43.660 --> 00:06:51.420]   - It all came to an end.
[00:06:51.420 --> 00:06:54.780]   But not only did Corcoran sports play the gospel,
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:57.580]   but nemesis, the most evil nemesis,
[00:06:57.580 --> 00:06:59.980]   accepted Christ and was moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:06:59.980 --> 00:07:01.420]   to follow God.
[00:07:01.420 --> 00:07:04.500]   And he came here for us to find out more
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:07.100]   cooked with the word of slander.
[00:07:07.100 --> 00:07:10.100]   (audience laughing)
[00:07:10.100 --> 00:07:13.460]   [APPLAUSE]
