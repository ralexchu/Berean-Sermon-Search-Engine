[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.200]   Good evening, everybody.
[00:00:11.200 --> 00:00:15.200]   Welcome to this evening's Bible study through Ephesians.
[00:00:15.200 --> 00:00:18.120]   Let's take a moment to pray and jump right into the study.
[00:00:18.120 --> 00:00:19.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:19.120 --> 00:00:23.520]   Our God, we thank you, Lord, so much for your grace.
[00:00:23.520 --> 00:00:29.400]   And Father, as we've been studying the book of Ephesians, Lord, we recognize that your
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:35.840]   love truly is so deep, so intentional, so methodical.
[00:00:35.840 --> 00:00:41.080]   What's more, Father God, we recognize that your love is so intimate, that God, you lavish
[00:00:41.080 --> 00:00:43.640]   your love upon us as your children.
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:48.240]   And so we want to dive just deeper into understanding to greater degree.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:53.680]   What's more, we pray, Father God, that that would elicit in us a response of faith, a
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:58.360]   response of trust, and God reciprocating our love to you.
[00:00:58.360 --> 00:01:01.440]   We thank you, it's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:02.680]   Amen.
[00:01:02.680 --> 00:01:08.680]   As we look through the Bible study today, we're not going to be doing a review because
[00:01:08.680 --> 00:01:14.820]   later on as we walk through the passage, there will be a review built into the study.
[00:01:14.820 --> 00:01:18.680]   So I'll read for us the passage now.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:26.280]   And the scripture says, reading again in Ephesians chapter 3, verses 14 through 21, "For this
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:30.920]   reason I bow my knees before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:36.320]   its name, that he would grant you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened
[00:01:36.320 --> 00:01:41.520]   with power through his Spirit in the inner man, so that Christ may dwell in your hearts
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:47.460]   through faith, and that you, being rooted and grounded in love, may be able to comprehend
[00:01:47.460 --> 00:01:52.840]   with all the saints what is the breadth and the length and the height and the depth, and
[00:01:52.840 --> 00:01:57.640]   to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, that you may be filled up to all
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:01:58.880]   the fullness of God.
[00:01:58.880 --> 00:02:04.720]   Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all that we ask or think, according
[00:02:04.720 --> 00:02:09.800]   to the power that works within us, to him be the glory in the church, and in Christ
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:13.880]   Jesus to all generations forever and ever.
[00:02:13.880 --> 00:02:15.240]   Amen."
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:22.620]   As we look at this passage, there is a strong prayer here for every single believer.
[00:02:22.620 --> 00:02:28.600]   And so what we wanted to do first is take a look at one of the study questions was,
[00:02:28.600 --> 00:02:30.920]   what prompted the prayer?
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:35.440]   Apostle Paul in a couple of occasions said, "For this reason," and so we have to ask,
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.720]   what was this reason?
[00:02:39.720 --> 00:02:46.880]   And what we notice is actually that this phrase, "For this reason," occurred in verse 1.
[00:02:46.880 --> 00:02:51.920]   Apostle Paul said, "For this reason I, Paul, the prisoner of Christ Jesus, for the sake
[00:02:51.920 --> 00:02:58.080]   of you Gentiles," and then he paused in that moment, and when he paused, he paused to ask
[00:02:58.080 --> 00:03:02.240]   us the question, "Did you really understand the gospel?
[00:03:02.240 --> 00:03:04.360]   Do you understand what God is doing?
[00:03:04.360 --> 00:03:08.920]   And do you understand why I'm trying to make sure I teach you these things?"
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:14.240]   And then he picks back up his thought in verse 14 and says, "For this reason I bow my knees
[00:03:14.240 --> 00:03:18.760]   before the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name."
[00:03:18.760 --> 00:03:29.840]   And so, as we take a look at this, we wrestle with Apostle Paul's thought whenever we study
[00:03:29.840 --> 00:03:37.120]   the Bible because in a very methodical and I would say an intricate way, he strings together
[00:03:37.120 --> 00:03:38.120]   many thoughts.
[00:03:38.120 --> 00:03:44.520]   And what I'm going to say is, Apostle Paul then has been saying that leading up to this,
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:51.120]   there is a rationale, a motive as to why he is praying this for the church, for the people.
[00:03:51.120 --> 00:03:55.760]   And one of the things I just want to quickly mention is, every single one of us, at some
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.800]   seasons we can wrestle in prayer.
[00:03:57.800 --> 00:04:01.880]   Some seasons, because of certain needs, we are fervent in prayer.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:04.120]   Other seasons, we struggle.
[00:04:04.120 --> 00:04:09.560]   And perhaps it's difficult to pray, namely because prayer in and of itself is a difficult
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:15.720]   discipline, and sometimes it's difficult to pray because maybe we've experienced disappointment.
[00:04:15.720 --> 00:04:22.240]   But sometimes, it's difficult for us to pray, we struggle with it, because we're not reminded
[00:04:22.240 --> 00:04:25.040]   as to the grand purpose as to why.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:29.960]   I think if we were more encouraged as to the reason why we pray, then perhaps more so we
[00:04:29.960 --> 00:04:31.760]   would pray all the more regularly.
[00:04:31.760 --> 00:04:35.360]   Now, as we think about this, I have a couple questions for you.
[00:04:35.360 --> 00:04:36.720]   Could it be questions?
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:40.200]   What are the possible rationales as to why Apostle Paul is praying?
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:42.560]   What is the reason that he is talking about?
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:49.480]   Could it be that in verse 13, in our previous section, Apostle Paul mentioned that he wants
[00:04:49.480 --> 00:04:54.360]   to encourage the church because he doesn't want them to be disheartened by his tribulation,
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:57.000]   specifically the fact that he's in jail.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.800]   So when you think about this, Apostle Paul perhaps could be saying, "I really want you
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:05.720]   to understand that God does love you, and although with your eyes you see persecution
[00:05:05.720 --> 00:05:10.440]   coming, you see me in jail, although all this horrible stuff is happening, trust me, God
[00:05:10.440 --> 00:05:11.440]   really loves you.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:13.560]   I want you to know that."
[00:05:13.560 --> 00:05:18.160]   So there are some people, some commentators, who think that Apostle Paul is pointing to
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:21.080]   the fact that the church may be discouraged.
[00:05:21.080 --> 00:05:26.400]   And for us, if we received something of an exhortation, like "Follow me as I follow Christ,"
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:31.800]   or "Obey what I say, but the person who's speaking to you is in jail," it could be disheartening.
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:35.520]   As a matter of fact, it could lend to a little bit of suspicion, like, "What's actually
[00:05:35.520 --> 00:05:36.520]   happening?"
[00:05:36.520 --> 00:05:37.520]   Right?
[00:05:37.520 --> 00:05:44.000]   Now, I don't think this is the case, namely because when Apostle Paul states this reason,
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.360]   he goes above and beyond that parenthetical section in verses 12 to 13.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.200]   I'm sorry, verses 2 to 13.
[00:05:50.200 --> 00:05:53.320]   But rather, he says, "For this reason," at the beginning of the chapter, pointing to
[00:05:53.320 --> 00:05:54.880]   something before.
[00:05:54.880 --> 00:05:59.220]   A second potential is Paul's love for the church.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.700]   If we're looking at chapter 2, we recall that the church as it's being built, Apostle Paul
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:09.820]   in his description of the gospel in chapter 2 moved from personal salvation, moving from
[00:06:09.820 --> 00:06:15.860]   death to life, to what that means as a ramification, that we all are made one.
[00:06:15.860 --> 00:06:20.540]   That the dividing walls of animosity and enmity has been done away with, and so the church
[00:06:20.540 --> 00:06:21.540]   is built.
[00:06:21.540 --> 00:06:26.100]   And we described how God loves that church as its own household, and therefore, Apostle
[00:06:26.100 --> 00:06:29.860]   Paul, he essentially depicts in many ways his own love for the church.
[00:06:29.860 --> 00:06:33.340]   So is his love for the church the reason why he's praying?
[00:06:33.340 --> 00:06:34.340]   Could be.
[00:06:34.340 --> 00:06:38.740]   Although I think his love for the church is always shown, I think there's more to be said
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:40.260]   here.
[00:06:40.260 --> 00:06:47.060]   I think what Apostle Paul is pointing to is what he's been pointing to the whole time.
[00:06:47.060 --> 00:06:53.500]   And that is, Apostle Paul has been communicating that his great privilege, his grace to me,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:07:00.860]   the "Wow, I cannot believe I am a part of this stewardship, this responsibility," is
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:06.900]   his main point of what God has been doing in his intent and purpose.
[00:07:06.900 --> 00:07:12.300]   Apostle Paul has been revealing to us God's intention, not just from yesterday, not just
[00:07:12.300 --> 00:07:16.620]   from a generation ago, and not just from the time of the patriarchs.
[00:07:16.620 --> 00:07:21.460]   Apostle Paul has been showing to us God's heart and intention since God has created
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:22.940]   the world.
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:24.580]   And that is incredibly magnificent.
[00:07:24.580 --> 00:07:32.460]   And so when you think about that, we have Apostle Paul pointing to the great plan and
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:34.260]   mystery of God.
[00:07:34.260 --> 00:07:38.380]   On other portions of the book of Ephesians, he described it as the administration.
[00:07:38.380 --> 00:07:42.140]   He described it as the unfolding plan, right?
[00:07:42.140 --> 00:07:45.940]   And so what I'd like to do with you in a brief moment now is to walk through several passages
[00:07:45.940 --> 00:07:50.060]   together, and you have those passages on your packet, but you can walk through with me on
[00:07:50.060 --> 00:07:55.660]   your Bibles so that you can highlight those things and just make a note of how often Apostle
[00:07:55.660 --> 00:08:00.420]   Paul points to this in his thought, in his flow of thought.
[00:08:00.420 --> 00:08:06.460]   So in the immediate context, in Ephesians chapter 3, verse 11, Apostle Paul talks about
[00:08:06.460 --> 00:08:08.860]   this great mystery.
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:14.000]   And in establishing this great mystery, he specifically talks about what God is doing
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:20.520]   to draw individuals to be one underneath Christ, that even Gentiles will be saved through the
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.820]   name of Christ.
[00:08:21.820 --> 00:08:27.160]   But then what he says is this was in accordance with the eternal purpose which he carried
[00:08:27.160 --> 00:08:29.580]   out in Christ Jesus our Lord.
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:32.260]   So there's our concept, the purpose of the Lord.
[00:08:32.260 --> 00:08:37.220]   Here's another passage in Ephesians chapter 3, verses 9 through 10.
[00:08:37.220 --> 00:08:40.760]   Right before that, he says, "And to bring to light what is the administration of the
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:45.040]   mystery which for ages has been hidden in God who created all things," and look at
[00:08:45.040 --> 00:08:51.660]   this, "so that the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known through the church
[00:08:51.660 --> 00:08:54.860]   to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenly places."
[00:08:54.860 --> 00:09:01.440]   Piecing it together, we know that God is working to showcase his glory, his great and grand
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:02.440]   wisdom.
[00:09:02.440 --> 00:09:07.160]   The redemptive plan that God is doing, yes, it's massive, it's multifaceted, but all
[00:09:07.160 --> 00:09:13.960]   that goes to show the grandeur of God's glory and his wisdom to accomplish salvation.
[00:09:13.960 --> 00:09:19.360]   And prior to that, remember on chapter 2, there was so much that we could glean.
[00:09:19.360 --> 00:09:25.700]   In chapter 2, verses 1 through 6 at the beginning, Apostle Paul describes our incredible salvation
[00:09:25.700 --> 00:09:27.240]   in the mercy of God.
[00:09:27.240 --> 00:09:32.160]   We go from those who are absolutely dead in transgressions to those who are made alive
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:34.400]   in Christ, right?
[00:09:34.400 --> 00:09:39.160]   But look at what he says right after he says that in verses 1 through 6, in verse 7 he
[00:09:39.160 --> 00:09:46.440]   says, "So that in the ages to come, he might show the surpassing riches of his grace in
[00:09:46.440 --> 00:09:48.840]   kindness towards us in Christ Jesus."
[00:09:48.840 --> 00:09:57.280]   So what God is doing in his intent and plan is to showcase his mercies to the universe.
[00:09:57.280 --> 00:10:03.320]   And what's more, we go all the way back to chapter 1, and in chapter 1, we saw so much
[00:10:03.320 --> 00:10:05.960]   of God's intention and plan.
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:11.720]   For example, verses 4 through 6 of chapter 1 says, "Just as he chose us in him before
[00:10:11.720 --> 00:10:16.080]   the foundation of the world, that we would be holy and blameless before him."
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:22.000]   So one aspect of it, yes, God's intention was to redeem us as his own possession.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.600]   In love he predestined us to adoptions as sons through Jesus Christ to himself, according
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:33.120]   to the kind intention of his will, to the praise of the glory of his grace.
[00:10:33.120 --> 00:10:35.720]   So there you have God's intention and purpose.
[00:10:35.720 --> 00:10:40.640]   His redemptive plan, which is magnificent, which is a great mystery, which is a showcase
[00:10:40.640 --> 00:10:47.200]   of grand wisdom and mercy, but all that to praise and glory of his name.
[00:10:47.200 --> 00:10:52.600]   What's more, in verse 11 through 12 he says, "Also we have obtained an inheritance, having
[00:10:52.600 --> 00:10:56.720]   been predestined according to his purpose, who works all things after the counsel of
[00:10:56.720 --> 00:11:01.240]   his will, to the end that we who were the first to hope in Christ would be to the praise
[00:11:01.240 --> 00:11:03.640]   of his glory."
[00:11:03.640 --> 00:11:06.400]   There we have the same thoughts again.
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:10.360]   And then in the next section it says, "In him you also, after listening to the message
[00:11:10.360 --> 00:11:15.080]   of truth, the gospel of your salvation, having also believed, you were sealed in him with
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:19.760]   the Holy Spirit of promise, who is given as a pledge of our inheritance, with a view to
[00:11:19.760 --> 00:11:25.240]   the redemption of God's own possession, to the praise of his glory."
[00:11:25.240 --> 00:11:31.800]   So if you look in chapter 1, chapter 2, chapter 3, there was a consistent theme that Apostle
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:37.760]   Paul was looking at, that God has a masterful plan of salvation, but all of that was for
[00:11:37.760 --> 00:11:39.680]   his glory.
[00:11:39.680 --> 00:11:45.920]   And what's incredible is he says in verse 15, "So for this reason," this constant thought
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:50.960]   of this "for this reason," why he's writing to the church, why he's praying for the church,
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:56.520]   why he is teaching, and why he is doing his ministry, it has never left his mind.
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:58.000]   It's always been there.
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:03.680]   And so in thinking about God's grand intention and work from long ago, he sees the faith
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.720]   happening or existing within the church, and then he connects the dot essentially and says,
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:13.960]   "I'm praying for you because clearly God has applied and is working in you."
[00:12:13.960 --> 00:12:18.500]   And so he says, "I too, having heard of the faith in the Lord Jesus which exists among
[00:12:18.500 --> 00:12:22.600]   you and your love for all the saints, I do not cease giving thanks to you while making
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:24.720]   mention of you in my prayers."
[00:12:24.720 --> 00:12:30.040]   And what he prays here is so similar to our passage that we're studying today.
[00:12:30.040 --> 00:12:34.400]   Essentially he says that "God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give
[00:12:34.400 --> 00:12:38.000]   you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the knowledge of him.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.760]   I pray that the eyes of your heart may be enlightened so that you will know what is
[00:12:41.760 --> 00:12:46.440]   the hope of his calling, what are the riches of the glory of his inheritance in the saints,
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:50.680]   and what is the surpassing greatness of his power toward us who believe.
[00:12:50.680 --> 00:12:55.480]   These are in accordance with the working of the strength of his might."
[00:12:55.480 --> 00:13:04.880]   So essentially this reason of God's intended purpose of executing his redemption, but all
[00:13:04.880 --> 00:13:07.640]   that to his grand glory.
[00:13:07.640 --> 00:13:09.280]   That is what he's thinking about.
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:11.360]   He's thinking about God's plans.
[00:13:11.360 --> 00:13:13.480]   He's thinking about God's will.
[00:13:13.480 --> 00:13:22.320]   And so let's take a moment just to pause and meditate on this a little bit.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:32.560]   If we pause and meditate, we again at some times, we pray for certain seasons.
[00:13:32.560 --> 00:13:38.760]   And if we were to really think about our dedication to the glory and purpose of God, I believe
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:44.400]   we would then have a transcending motive.
[00:13:44.400 --> 00:13:46.600]   We would have a timeless motive.
[00:13:46.600 --> 00:13:50.840]   We would have an ever-present motive to continue to pray.
[00:13:50.840 --> 00:13:56.520]   And if you think about it, when we are only, if let's say our prayers are lopsided, and
[00:13:56.520 --> 00:14:00.160]   we are only praying for the things that are temporal, we're only praying for the things
[00:14:00.160 --> 00:14:05.680]   that are circumstantial, the things that are physical, then no wonder we don't pray often.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:10.720]   Because if I'm just praying for my class, for example, to go well and finish well, then
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:13.120]   once that class ends, then what?
[00:14:13.120 --> 00:14:15.200]   Then it's just on to the next thing, right?
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:17.760]   But do I care about the next thing as much?
[00:14:17.760 --> 00:14:22.000]   If I'm just praying for relief for circumstances, then what?
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:23.560]   If the relief comes?
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:28.560]   The fact of the matter is some of these things that we work for in terms of working for provision,
[00:14:28.560 --> 00:14:34.760]   working for grades, working for money, some of those things don't even necessarily require,
[00:14:34.760 --> 00:14:35.760]   right?
[00:14:35.760 --> 00:14:40.440]   Doesn't necessarily require like a mass miracle to happen.
[00:14:40.440 --> 00:14:43.520]   A lot of it is you reap what you sow.
[00:14:43.520 --> 00:14:47.840]   And so all I'm trying to point out is this, not that God is not intricately involved in
[00:14:47.840 --> 00:14:52.180]   the daily provision of our daily necessities, because he is.
[00:14:52.180 --> 00:14:56.560]   Not that God does not care for our daily bread, because he does.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:15:03.760]   But the fact of the matter is if the content of our prayers is not in tune with the grand
[00:15:03.760 --> 00:15:07.520]   purpose of God, it's going to lose motivation.
[00:15:07.520 --> 00:15:09.600]   It's going to lose steam.
[00:15:09.600 --> 00:15:14.480]   And so there's this question for you, what is it that you typically pray for?
[00:15:14.480 --> 00:15:20.320]   For Paul, he is seeing the masterful plan of God, and when he sees faith, he realizes
[00:15:20.320 --> 00:15:22.640]   then how it connects.
[00:15:22.640 --> 00:15:26.680]   And so I would hope that you would have your eyes open to see that even more.
[00:15:26.680 --> 00:15:32.240]   When you see certain things, you should have a framework to put, you know, they kind of
[00:15:32.240 --> 00:15:37.680]   talk about having some kind of grid or a structure so that you can hang stuff on, which totally
[00:15:37.680 --> 00:15:38.840]   makes sense.
[00:15:38.840 --> 00:15:42.560]   We see the grand, we've been given the privilege of seeing the grand masterful plan of God
[00:15:42.560 --> 00:15:47.600]   in redemption, and then that should cause us then to ask ourselves, how does this fit?
[00:15:47.600 --> 00:15:52.080]   And if we see it fit, we should be praying for those things.
[00:15:52.080 --> 00:15:57.560]   And so this, I do believe, is why Apostle Paul prays, and I think it was important enough
[00:15:57.560 --> 00:15:59.440]   to spend that kind of time on it.
[00:15:59.440 --> 00:16:03.720]   What's more, I think because he was thinking about that, that's why Apostle Paul, when
[00:16:03.720 --> 00:16:07.920]   he says, "For this reason," that is the reason for his prayer, but also that's the reason
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:10.640]   for the doxology.
[00:16:10.640 --> 00:16:12.120]   I have a blank for you there.
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.120]   The reason for the prayer and the doxology.
[00:16:16.120 --> 00:16:17.560]   What do I mean by that?
[00:16:17.560 --> 00:16:22.400]   What's really interesting is, as he begins with, "For this reason," and points back multiple
[00:16:22.400 --> 00:16:28.600]   times to the will, the intention, and the purpose of God, he also concludes this section
[00:16:28.600 --> 00:16:34.080]   and this first part, the first half, with this amazing doxology.
[00:16:34.080 --> 00:16:39.840]   And within this doxology, he says, "Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly
[00:16:39.840 --> 00:16:45.200]   beyond all that we ask or think according to the power that works within us.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:52.160]   To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus to all generations forever and ever.
[00:16:52.160 --> 00:16:53.160]   Amen."
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:16:54.160]   Okay?
[00:16:54.160 --> 00:16:55.160]   Now, I think he's going the wrong way.
[00:16:55.160 --> 00:17:00.840]   That first part of it in verse 20, one might be thinking like, "Hmm, we're just supposed
[00:17:00.840 --> 00:17:02.520]   to expect a ton from God."
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:03.520]   No.
[00:17:03.520 --> 00:17:09.040]   I think Apostle Paul is looking at God's intention and plan and looking at the people and just
[00:17:09.040 --> 00:17:11.120]   wanting the church to know.
[00:17:11.120 --> 00:17:16.760]   I want you to know God's amazing plan for you.
[00:17:16.760 --> 00:17:23.000]   Because lest you forget, God is not just trying to make you a winner in Orange County.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:28.560]   That would be an incredibly, incredibly small plan if it was God's plan.
[00:17:28.560 --> 00:17:33.560]   God says, "I'm going to make you holy and blameless and present you before me in all
[00:17:33.560 --> 00:17:38.720]   eternity, completely clean, righteous.
[00:17:38.720 --> 00:17:41.720]   You're going to be glorified."
[00:17:41.720 --> 00:17:47.400]   And so, Apostle Paul, when he says, "God is able to do far more than what you're thinking,"
[00:17:47.400 --> 00:17:50.200]   I think he has a lot more in his mind than what we're thinking.
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:51.200]   That's my point.
[00:17:51.200 --> 00:17:55.240]   I think Apostle Paul is thinking to great grandeur.
[00:17:55.240 --> 00:18:00.880]   The thing about it is other gospel writers and other apostles speak the same way.
[00:18:00.880 --> 00:18:04.280]   "Man, if you only knew what God has in store."
[00:18:04.280 --> 00:18:08.720]   This is kind of like the 1 Peter, I think it's 2 Peter chapter 3 passage where a lot
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:11.480]   of people, he was like, "Some will say, 'What gives?
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:12.760]   Where is the coming?
[00:18:12.760 --> 00:18:15.080]   Since our father's past, it's been the same thing.'"
[00:18:15.080 --> 00:18:25.040]   And Apostle Peter is like, "Oh man, only if you knew what God counts as brevity and time.
[00:18:25.040 --> 00:18:28.840]   Only if you knew what was in store of what God is going to do."
[00:18:28.840 --> 00:18:33.080]   In the same way, that to Apostle Paul is his doxology.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:39.320]   If you actually knew and thought about all that God is intending and planning, praise.
[00:18:39.320 --> 00:18:41.800]   Praise be to God and the church.
[00:18:41.800 --> 00:18:44.520]   And likewise, here's an interesting thought.
[00:18:44.520 --> 00:18:45.880]   There's this other verse in verse 15.
[00:18:45.880 --> 00:18:49.920]   I'm going to just briefly mention it because it's a little confusing.
[00:18:49.920 --> 00:18:54.680]   So Apostle Paul in the beginning of this prayer, he says, "For this reason I bow my knees before
[00:18:54.680 --> 00:19:00.600]   the Father, from whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name."
[00:19:00.600 --> 00:19:05.160]   Now, because of for the sake of time, there is an appendix.
[00:19:05.160 --> 00:19:11.480]   There is an appendix of why I think it means what I'm about to say.
[00:19:11.480 --> 00:19:15.960]   I believe when he says, "From whom every family in heaven and on earth derives its name," he's
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:19.640]   not talking about every single family in existence.
[00:19:19.640 --> 00:19:23.440]   I think he's talking about every saint across time.
[00:19:23.440 --> 00:19:27.960]   Those who are in heaven already and those who are on earth.
[00:19:27.960 --> 00:19:33.040]   And what I'm thinking is when Apostle Paul is thinking about the Father, ones who have
[00:19:33.040 --> 00:19:37.600]   a relationship like that, what is he thinking about?
[00:19:37.600 --> 00:19:42.400]   He is thinking about how God has already worked.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.280]   When you think about the church, you're thinking about, "Wow.
[00:19:46.280 --> 00:19:47.440]   Look at the hand of God.
[00:19:47.440 --> 00:19:49.780]   Look what God is creating."
[00:19:49.780 --> 00:19:52.220]   Because that's what the church is supposed to show.
[00:19:52.220 --> 00:19:53.220]   We are the handiwork.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:55.760]   We're the workmanship.
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:20:00.000]   When you think about saved individuals, you're looking at spiritually transformed people
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.640]   by the power of God, by the Spirit of God.
[00:20:02.640 --> 00:20:09.200]   And so again, I believe Apostle Paul's mind is just wrapped up in God's incredible intention,
[00:20:09.200 --> 00:20:11.440]   purpose, and glory.
[00:20:11.440 --> 00:20:13.600]   Question to you.
[00:20:13.600 --> 00:20:22.300]   If your mind also is not aware of God's glory, God's plan, God's purposes, you will always
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:24.720]   be out of touch with reality.
[00:20:24.720 --> 00:20:29.480]   What's more, you're going to have a very hard time making sense of your life.
[00:20:29.480 --> 00:20:32.880]   What's more, you're going to be complaining.
[00:20:32.880 --> 00:20:37.560]   What's more, you're going to be devastated and despair.
[00:20:37.560 --> 00:20:44.600]   If our hearts as believers are not wowed, not only wowed, but then submissive to, not
[00:20:44.600 --> 00:20:50.680]   only submissive to, but devoted to the great cause of the glory of God, we are losing track
[00:20:50.680 --> 00:20:56.880]   of what our God, our Father is doing in this time.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:20:58.480]   Why now?
[00:20:58.480 --> 00:20:59.480]   Why this?
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:00.480]   Why everything?
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:01.640]   Right?
[00:21:01.640 --> 00:21:08.400]   And so again, maybe we're talking a bit too overly philosophical or theoretical, but as
[00:21:08.400 --> 00:21:15.080]   we see the example of Apostle Paul, this he points to as a reason why he prays and what's
[00:21:15.080 --> 00:21:17.720]   more as a reason why he writes in this way.
[00:21:17.720 --> 00:21:18.720]   Okay?
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:23.440]   This has an exhortation for us if we're struggling with how to pray more in line with God's will,
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:25.520]   Apostle Paul gives us his example here.
[00:21:25.520 --> 00:21:30.320]   Okay, moving to number two, which we're going to take a little bit of less time on because
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.920]   I just want to do an overview and sequence.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:33.920]   Okay?
[00:21:33.920 --> 00:21:37.120]   So what I mean by that is let's take a look at this passage and what I'm going to do is
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:42.980]   just a quick pop, pop, pop, pop, pop, comment on each of the different points of prayer
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:44.440]   to give you the overview.
[00:21:44.440 --> 00:21:45.440]   Right?
[00:21:45.440 --> 00:21:49.960]   And just as a quick tip, remember it's so important to look at the repetitions and see
[00:21:49.960 --> 00:21:53.380]   how he uses certain phrases to introduce his prayers.
[00:21:53.380 --> 00:21:57.760]   So I noticed he uses the term that and then he introduces a prayer.
[00:21:57.760 --> 00:22:03.560]   So there is that he would grant you to be strengthened with power and the next phrase
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:08.960]   is I moved according to his riches, according to the riches of his glory because it modifies
[00:22:08.960 --> 00:22:13.960]   or describes the strengthening that it would be in accordance with the riches of God.
[00:22:13.960 --> 00:22:19.640]   Through his spirit in the inner man so that Christ may dwell in your hearts through faith
[00:22:19.640 --> 00:22:22.740]   and that you may be able to comprehend.
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:25.560]   So this would be one lump kind of prayer.
[00:22:25.560 --> 00:22:29.000]   You're supposed to comprehend with the rest of the saints.
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   Okay?
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:31.760]   Again, he's thinking all the saints.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:32.760]   What is the breath?
[00:22:32.760 --> 00:22:33.760]   What is the length?
[00:22:33.760 --> 00:22:34.760]   What is the height and the depth?
[00:22:34.760 --> 00:22:36.640]   I'm not sure exactly which way it has to go.
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:41.160]   And he says and to know the love of Christ which surpasses knowledge, being rooted and
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:46.400]   grounded in love that you may be filled up to all the fullness of God.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:50.600]   By way of summary for you, here are the terms just as a quick summary.
[00:22:50.600 --> 00:22:51.600]   Right?
[00:22:51.600 --> 00:22:56.000]   The number one thing that he says is that God would grant strength with power.
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:02.440]   And then it moves to so that Christ may dwell in your heart and that you may know Christ's
[00:23:02.440 --> 00:23:03.440]   love.
[00:23:03.440 --> 00:23:09.600]   I set this apart as a separate prayer because being rooted and grounded in love is a participle
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:14.040]   meaning this is what you're supposed to be as you know the love of God.
[00:23:14.040 --> 00:23:17.880]   But I think what he's thinking, he's thinking progression, right?
[00:23:17.880 --> 00:23:24.000]   That as you know the depth of Christ's love, you are going to be rooted and grounded, unshakable
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:25.520]   in the love of Christ.
[00:23:25.520 --> 00:23:31.120]   And what's more, it's going to culminate to being filled with the fullness of God.
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:32.120]   Okay?
[00:23:32.120 --> 00:23:37.400]   Now one of the things that I asked you was not only do we see the points of the prayer,
[00:23:37.400 --> 00:23:39.080]   is there some kind of sequence?
[00:23:39.080 --> 00:23:41.920]   And my answer is yes, there was.
[00:23:41.920 --> 00:23:46.440]   Now I've only done a couple of these things because again, every single one of these points
[00:23:46.440 --> 00:23:51.400]   of the strength, the dwelling, the know, rooted and filled, they could each take essentially
[00:23:51.400 --> 00:23:53.200]   like one sermon, right?
[00:23:53.200 --> 00:23:58.200]   Or an explanation and kind of observation that we could look at other passages and all
[00:23:58.200 --> 00:23:59.200]   that kind of stuff.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.360]   But one of the important things I wanted to highlight is there definitely seemed to be
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.840]   a sequence for Apostle Paul as he's thinking about this.
[00:24:06.840 --> 00:24:11.600]   And what's interesting is that in this sequence, it's not necessarily the way that perhaps
[00:24:11.600 --> 00:24:15.060]   we might originally think about it or naturally think about it.
[00:24:15.060 --> 00:24:17.920]   Which is, doesn't it always start with you be in Christ?
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   Christ is in you.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:20.080]   That's the starting point.
[00:24:20.080 --> 00:24:23.120]   And then you can do the act of faith, right?
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:29.020]   But I think Apostle Paul has the other aspect of our Christian life in mind here.
[00:24:29.020 --> 00:24:30.600]   What I mean is this.
[00:24:30.600 --> 00:24:36.180]   He begins with being strengthened in the inner person, right?
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:40.520]   He begins with being strengthened by the spirit in the inner man.
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:46.160]   And so, what he's praying for when you think about that strength of the inner person is
[00:24:46.160 --> 00:24:48.480]   faith.
[00:24:48.480 --> 00:24:54.100]   That faith is going to cause us so that in every aspect of our life, Christ is going
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.360]   to dwell in our hearts.
[00:24:56.360 --> 00:25:00.840]   And as Christ dwells in our hearts in every experience, in every aspect of our lives,
[00:25:00.840 --> 00:25:04.320]   we are going to experientially know because guess what?
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:08.400]   That know therefore may know Christ, it's gnosco.
[00:25:08.400 --> 00:25:12.680]   You're supposed to have a personal, interactive, experiential knowledge.
[00:25:12.680 --> 00:25:18.200]   Not a conceptual one, not just intellect, but a knowledge of the love of God.
[00:25:18.200 --> 00:25:24.280]   And what that causes you to do is be all the more firmly rooted and therefore as you are
[00:25:24.280 --> 00:25:29.400]   more and more firmly rooted in Christ's love, you're going to be filled over and over and
[00:25:29.400 --> 00:25:30.400]   over again.
[00:25:30.400 --> 00:25:36.020]   So as we think about that, I just want to make mention of this.
[00:25:36.020 --> 00:25:43.440]   What he's thinking of here then is not so much just the salvation move, although again,
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:49.440]   as significant as that is, I think what he has in mind is the growth and sanctification
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:56.440]   of every believer who is supposed to experientially grow in the depth of knowledge of Christ having
[00:25:56.440 --> 00:25:57.440]   dwelt in our hearts.
[00:25:57.440 --> 00:26:03.760]   I'm just going to use this one specific thing as an example why.
[00:26:03.760 --> 00:26:09.560]   Because even when you look at that term dwell, there are different Greek terms for staying
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:12.000]   or dwelling or living.
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:15.560]   So just like in English we have those terms, in Greek there are many terms as well for
[00:26:15.560 --> 00:26:18.320]   the concept of someone being in someone's home.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:26.480]   But here, if you look up this definition of this word, dwelling means to not just visit,
[00:26:26.480 --> 00:26:28.880]   but it means to stay permanently.
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:35.680]   The idea of make a dwelling as to mean that in terms of Christ filling our minds or filling
[00:26:35.680 --> 00:26:39.760]   those experiences, the way I like to think about it is for us, as we move through certain
[00:26:39.760 --> 00:26:43.820]   experiences, what's going to happen is you're going to be tested.
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.740]   And different parts of your heart are going to be exposed.
[00:26:46.740 --> 00:26:51.240]   And when that happens, you're going to realize, you know what, certain areas of my life I've
[00:26:51.240 --> 00:26:53.840]   never thought how does God fit.
[00:26:53.840 --> 00:26:58.840]   Certain areas of my life I never thought how does God impact or what's the ramification?
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:03.320]   What's the implication of Him being Lord here?
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:07.680]   And so a lot of the commentators make much of this and say, "Is God somebody who is a
[00:27:07.680 --> 00:27:14.480]   visitor who you've invited to the living room or is He living with you, having access to
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:17.520]   every single part of your house?
[00:27:17.520 --> 00:27:18.760]   What's He saying?"
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:23.600]   The idea is we are to be growing in our faith, in our experience.
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:31.960]   We are to be growing in every measure of what we are thinking, our heart and our desires,
[00:27:31.960 --> 00:27:37.000]   our will and our intentions, the devotions, the clarity of our conscience, the trust that
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:40.840]   we exercise, all of these things that are internal.
[00:27:40.840 --> 00:27:46.640]   Those are the inner man faith concepts and exercises that we are supposed to be growing
[00:27:46.640 --> 00:27:47.640]   in.
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:51.240]   And so in that way, there is a sequence that we're supposed to be growing in.
[00:27:51.240 --> 00:27:55.240]   And I believe as we do this, what's going to happen is this is going to allow us to
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:28:02.600]   take every single experience that we have, every hurdle, every success, whatever experience
[00:28:02.600 --> 00:28:08.040]   we have, we're going to be able to walk through those experiences with Christ and come out
[00:28:08.040 --> 00:28:16.560]   stronger in our faith, come out more refined, come out more biblical, more real in our thinking.
[00:28:16.560 --> 00:28:20.120]   And that's what essentially happens to Apostle Paul.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:25.320]   One of the passages I want to highlight to you is Apostle Paul saying that he has this
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:31.000]   treasure in earthen vessels so that the surpassing greatness of the power will be of God and
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:32.640]   not from ourselves.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:36.880]   We are afflicted in every way, but not crushed, perplexed, but not despairing, persecuted,
[00:28:36.880 --> 00:28:42.020]   but not forsaken, struck down, but not destroyed, always caring about in the body the dying
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:46.920]   of Jesus so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body.
[00:28:46.920 --> 00:28:51.080]   Four, all things are for your sake so that the grace which is spreading to more and more
[00:28:51.080 --> 00:28:55.120]   people may cause the giving of thanks to bound to the glory of God.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:57.120]   Therefore, we do not lose heart.
[00:28:57.120 --> 00:29:03.080]   But though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:06.400]   I'm going to stop for the sake of time, but you see what he's saying?
[00:29:06.400 --> 00:29:10.720]   We're going to go through these hurdles, we're going to be persecuted, beaten, struck down,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:15.080]   but our inner man is being strengthened daily.
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:21.640]   Okay, so we've looked at the overview and the sequence of the prayers, but there is
[00:29:21.640 --> 00:29:22.640]   a theme.
[00:29:22.640 --> 00:29:25.000]   Essentially, there is a focal point.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:30.720]   The focal point is that there should be incredible strength in God's incredible power for every
[00:29:30.720 --> 00:29:32.000]   believer.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.840]   The way I want to put it is, let's pray for that.
[00:29:36.840 --> 00:29:42.720]   Let's devote ourselves to pray regularly for powerful faith.
[00:29:42.720 --> 00:29:47.640]   Let's pray to experience God's power through that faith.
[00:29:47.640 --> 00:29:53.160]   And the way I would like to do this is I want to go through the passage again with the thematic
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.640]   observation of strength.
[00:29:55.640 --> 00:30:00.520]   How do all those elements that we see within this prayer contribute to an individual who
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:05.280]   is in Christ being strong in the power of God?
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:11.440]   Pray for, first, he talks about again the main idea, says that he, God, would grant
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:16.440]   you according to the riches of his glory to be strengthened with power.
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:17.440]   The word there is dunamite.
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:21.840]   Now again, I'm not going to talk about dynamite or whatever, but that is ability, that is
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:29.160]   capacity, that is the capacity to exercise a will and accomplish it.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:35.400]   There is an enablement that God desires in us to actually be strong.
[00:30:35.400 --> 00:30:41.560]   Is it more and more godly for people to have this, "I'm totally depraved, worthless am
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:42.560]   I?"
[00:30:42.560 --> 00:30:45.400]   Let's be a little bit more precise.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:51.280]   Without Christ, worthless you are, totally depraved you were, but now as you are in Christ,
[00:30:51.280 --> 00:30:56.680]   you're living by the Spirit, sealed, empowered, the Spirit is with you and in you and so is
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   Christ.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:30:58.680]   Right?
[00:30:58.680 --> 00:31:02.020]   Let's be a little bit more precise with our wording.
[00:31:02.020 --> 00:31:03.980]   We have the power of God.
[00:31:03.980 --> 00:31:08.880]   And what's more, this power, let's pray for rich, glorious strength.
[00:31:08.880 --> 00:31:11.280]   This power, he says, is according to the riches of his glory.
[00:31:11.280 --> 00:31:12.280]   Now think about that.
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.920]   Okay, we can go on doing like one of those cross-reference studies and think about riches.
[00:31:17.920 --> 00:31:23.440]   The richness of his mercy, the richness of his grace, the richness of this and that.
[00:31:23.440 --> 00:31:26.960]   Here he says the richness of his glory.
[00:31:26.960 --> 00:31:32.700]   If God is to bless us, this is one incredible blessing.
[00:31:32.700 --> 00:31:37.780]   To have the power of God according to the riches of his glory, that's like limitless.
[00:31:37.780 --> 00:31:38.780]   Right?
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:41.380]   That's like saying, "Have power unending."
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:42.380]   Right?
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:46.500]   That would be, because there's no parameters to the riches of God's glory.
[00:31:46.500 --> 00:31:48.460]   It's like the universe and more.
[00:31:48.460 --> 00:31:49.460]   Right?
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:52.180]   I mean, we can't even begin to describe.
[00:31:52.180 --> 00:31:56.660]   Moving forward, not only are we supposed to have this rich and glorious strength, let's
[00:31:56.660 --> 00:31:58.460]   pray for inner strength.
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:31:59.460]   Right?
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:03.140]   That we are to be strong in the inner man.
[00:32:03.140 --> 00:32:09.300]   Strong in our thought, in truth, in our understanding, in knowledge, in faith.
[00:32:09.300 --> 00:32:14.420]   So many times we wish, we just wish so much that we were strong in so many other ways.
[00:32:14.420 --> 00:32:17.100]   We wish that, "Oh, you know, I have a test coming up."
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:21.300]   As you can tell, I'm talking about tests a lot because I'm studying.
[00:32:21.300 --> 00:32:24.460]   "We have a test coming up and oh, I have anxiety.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:25.460]   What if I fail?"
[00:32:25.460 --> 00:32:26.460]   Right?
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:27.460]   Every person wrestles with that.
[00:32:27.460 --> 00:32:30.580]   "What am I actually praying there?"
[00:32:30.580 --> 00:32:34.380]   It could be all I'm praying for is make me smarter, make me smarter.
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:36.900]   Is that truly inner strength?
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:38.260]   Right?
[00:32:38.260 --> 00:32:40.480]   We're talking about inner faith.
[00:32:40.480 --> 00:32:42.400]   We're talking about trusting God.
[00:32:42.400 --> 00:32:47.580]   We're talking about having the inner strength as the halls of faith would say, the faith
[00:32:47.580 --> 00:32:48.580]   to do so much.
[00:32:48.580 --> 00:32:51.700]   Now, I'm going to come to that later, so let's move forward.
[00:32:51.700 --> 00:32:54.740]   Let's request and pray for residing strength.
[00:32:54.740 --> 00:33:00.420]   Again, when we think about Christ dwelling within us, really, like think about that.
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:07.420]   I mean, we want to have not a temporary God is our physician who is a visiting doctor.
[00:33:07.420 --> 00:33:13.580]   No, we want Christ to be residing with us, daily abiding with us, walking with him step
[00:33:13.580 --> 00:33:15.220]   by step.
[00:33:15.220 --> 00:33:18.340]   Let's pray for an established strength.
[00:33:18.340 --> 00:33:23.820]   You know how that passage described being rooted and grounded in love?
[00:33:23.820 --> 00:33:25.380]   Doesn't that just challenge you so much?
[00:33:25.380 --> 00:33:27.300]   Let me ask you, right?
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:33.820]   How many of you now, especially in these uncertain times, actually feel like you are rooted,
[00:33:33.820 --> 00:33:35.900]   very unshakable, right?
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:41.460]   The tides of the day, the news, it's not causing you to shift left and right, but rather you
[00:33:41.460 --> 00:33:43.140]   feel like you're rooted.
[00:33:43.140 --> 00:33:48.660]   What's more, that term, the next term of grounded is talking about established on a firm foundation.
[00:33:48.660 --> 00:33:53.780]   Again, very descriptive ways to describe being the strength that we're supposed to have and
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:59.580]   lastly, he prays that we would be filled with the fullness of God.
[00:33:59.580 --> 00:34:01.300]   Wow.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:04.420]   Filled with the fullness of God.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.140]   I want you to think about that again.
[00:34:07.140 --> 00:34:11.180]   What we are praying for is not temporary success.
[00:34:11.180 --> 00:34:12.980]   I mean, let me ask this question in this way.
[00:34:12.980 --> 00:34:13.980]   What would be a miracle?
[00:34:13.980 --> 00:34:14.980]   Right?
[00:34:14.980 --> 00:34:17.620]   Sometimes we're just sitting there thinking, "Oh my gosh, it would be so sweet.
[00:34:17.620 --> 00:34:21.740]   It'd be such a miracle if..."
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:25.900]   And then we have these thoughts about what could happen if all our bills were paid, if
[00:34:25.900 --> 00:34:30.940]   our student loans were gone, if our X, Y, and Z happened.
[00:34:30.940 --> 00:34:31.940]   Would that be the miracle?
[00:34:31.940 --> 00:34:38.580]   I think here and now when we think about being filled with God over and over again, this
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:42.260]   would be to us the eternal miracle, right?
[00:34:42.260 --> 00:34:46.700]   This would be to us something that pervades every single part of our lives.
[00:34:46.700 --> 00:34:48.740]   Constant strength.
[00:34:48.740 --> 00:34:49.980]   Constant strength.
[00:34:49.980 --> 00:34:51.500]   I want that.
[00:34:51.500 --> 00:34:53.860]   This is the kind of strength I want.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:34:57.500]   And I pray that this is the kind of prayer that we're praying for the people that we
[00:34:57.500 --> 00:34:58.500]   love.
[00:34:58.500 --> 00:35:02.900]   And more importantly, this is the kind of prayer that we're praying for ourselves.
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:06.400]   Apostle Paul says this is what he is praying for.
[00:35:06.400 --> 00:35:08.060]   He wants us to be strong.
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:13.820]   And you know that later on, Apostle Paul is going to command us, "Finally, be strong.
[00:35:13.820 --> 00:35:17.260]   Be strong in the might of the Lord."
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:23.020]   And essentially what Apostle Paul has been trying to do is to show us God is absolutely
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:29.260]   transforming us from that depraved sinner who was dead in transgression so far from
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:30.260]   God.
[00:35:30.260 --> 00:35:33.460]   Look at how transformed you are now.
[00:35:33.460 --> 00:35:35.060]   You have the Spirit in you.
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:38.300]   The whole time he's been trying to show us the richness of what we have.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:43.940]   He's been saying from the very beginning, "Look how you've been so incredibly blessed.
[00:35:43.940 --> 00:35:44.940]   You have it all.
[00:35:44.940 --> 00:35:49.540]   You have every single spiritual blessing.
[00:35:49.540 --> 00:35:55.180]   Please do not walk around with your head down, acting as though you have nothing."
[00:35:55.180 --> 00:35:58.860]   Let's meditate on this for a little bit.
[00:35:58.860 --> 00:36:06.500]   God wants to transform us, but for us, do we live our Christian lives as though we've
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:09.780]   been just trying to do a diet?
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:11.700]   This is my example.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:17.380]   I think for a lot of times, people, they feel this need for the internal strength, especially
[00:36:17.380 --> 00:36:20.380]   when it comes to things like diets, right?
[00:36:20.380 --> 00:36:22.420]   Because they know it's good for them.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:24.420]   They've experienced what it feels like when you're unhealthy.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:30.060]   You're all sluggish and groggy and unmotivated and tired and fatigued every day.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:31.820]   Nobody wants to feel like that.
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.220]   And so they know they need to go on a diet.
[00:36:33.220 --> 00:36:38.340]   They know they need to be on a health regimen of exercise and good food.
[00:36:38.340 --> 00:36:40.740]   But then the hard part is what?
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:41.740]   Willpower.
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:47.580]   When that donut's there, it's just so soft and fluffy.
[00:36:47.580 --> 00:36:52.660]   You just want to eat it, and your willpower is so weak.
[00:36:52.660 --> 00:36:59.420]   Especially if, let's say, you previously were in a habit already of not eating well.
[00:36:59.420 --> 00:37:02.060]   There's so many rationales in your head.
[00:37:02.060 --> 00:37:04.860]   The willpower is weak.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:08.900]   One of the examples that I was thinking of was even something stronger than food, which
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:10.200]   is drugs.
[00:37:10.200 --> 00:37:14.380]   You think about all these programs the government tries to put on, whether it was, in my day,
[00:37:14.380 --> 00:37:15.940]   it was the DARE program.
[00:37:15.940 --> 00:37:18.140]   DARE, to keep kids off drugs.
[00:37:18.140 --> 00:37:19.700]   Just say no, right?
[00:37:19.700 --> 00:37:22.780]   It's not cool to do drugs or something like that.
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:26.780]   But after evaluation, it's been shown it's just not that effective.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.340]   You could try to have run classes.
[00:37:28.340 --> 00:37:31.620]   You could try to have a cop come by your school and just be like, "Yeah, man."
[00:37:31.620 --> 00:37:32.620]   It may work.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:33.620]   It may work.
[00:37:33.620 --> 00:37:36.940]   It may really help to show graphic videos of what happens when you do drugs or something
[00:37:36.940 --> 00:37:38.500]   like that.
[00:37:38.500 --> 00:37:40.640]   But willpower.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:45.840]   Sometimes a kid who's tempted by his friends just doesn't have the willpower to say no.
[00:37:45.840 --> 00:37:48.280]   "Why do I bring this up?"
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.920]   Is that how you feel with your faith?
[00:37:49.920 --> 00:37:52.480]   Like, "Yeah, I know it's good.
[00:37:52.480 --> 00:37:53.480]   I've seen the video.
[00:37:53.480 --> 00:37:58.340]   I know what happens when you don't practice faithfulness to God and obedience to the Lord."
[00:37:58.340 --> 00:38:01.480]   But the willpower to say no, it's just not there, right?
[00:38:01.480 --> 00:38:03.960]   You just feel so weak.
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:10.900]   Now partially, I'm part doing this as an example and metaphor.
[00:38:10.900 --> 00:38:17.520]   But obviously, we've all probably felt the devastating feeling of being defeated and
[00:38:17.520 --> 00:38:23.440]   not having what it feels like, the strength in you to say no to sin and then to say yes
[00:38:23.440 --> 00:38:28.720]   to righteousness and then to do the high calling of God, to love people that are difficult
[00:38:28.720 --> 00:38:33.960]   to love, to swallow your pride, to surrender, to be godly, to be Christ-like.
[00:38:33.960 --> 00:38:39.240]   I mean, we've all experienced what it feels like to have that kind of weakness.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:44.040]   But Apostle Paul is challenging every single one of us.
[00:38:44.040 --> 00:38:45.700]   Let's pray.
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:50.780]   Let's pray for the strength because the strength is available to us in Christ.
[00:38:50.780 --> 00:38:53.700]   In some sense, we have it.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:56.660]   We need to realize and exercise.
[00:38:56.660 --> 00:39:02.220]   We need to make sure that we are trying to live this life not with these rationales.
[00:39:02.220 --> 00:39:05.820]   Sometimes people come to me when they have sufferings and they're just like, "But
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:10.380]   dude, Pastor Mark, you don't know the things that I've been through, right?
[00:39:10.380 --> 00:39:11.940]   People don't know the things that I've been through.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:15.100]   It's way too hard to move forward."
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:18.760]   I'm going to encourage you.
[00:39:18.760 --> 00:39:19.860]   Partially true.
[00:39:19.860 --> 00:39:24.860]   I may not have suffered to the extent you have, okay?
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:28.500]   But this does not apply to our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:32.740]   He has gone through so much suffering.
[00:39:32.740 --> 00:39:34.660]   He can sympathize with us.
[00:39:34.660 --> 00:39:38.780]   He will empathize in every way that we are tempted.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:44.700]   And God is going to show us his great power, his great strength in us through Christ.
[00:39:44.700 --> 00:39:48.780]   A kind of strength where we're not just overcoming a test, right?
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:56.140]   We're overcoming the demons and the Satans of this world and all the evil forces of schemes
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:58.540]   and darkness.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:03.860]   We're overcoming years of slavery.
[00:40:03.860 --> 00:40:08.540]   We're overcoming wickedness, ungodliness.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:11.820]   I want to encourage you, every single one of you.
[00:40:11.820 --> 00:40:14.820]   Apostle Paul is praying for power.
[00:40:14.820 --> 00:40:19.820]   And Christ himself, even this past week, I was reminded, he is the one who said, "Through
[00:40:19.820 --> 00:40:24.020]   faith, you could tell this mountain to jump into the ocean."
[00:40:24.020 --> 00:40:26.380]   That's how powerful faith is.
[00:40:26.380 --> 00:40:29.060]   Do you understand?
[00:40:29.060 --> 00:40:33.100]   Through faith, you're going to be made new.
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:37.700]   And even from beginning in this life, you're going to experience that newness.
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:40.620]   And I want to encourage you with that.
[00:40:40.620 --> 00:40:42.460]   That's incredible.
[00:40:42.460 --> 00:40:48.260]   And so you guys recall, that's from Mark 11, verse 23, that with faith, even just a
[00:40:48.260 --> 00:40:53.660]   mustard seed, everything we thought impossible without God is absolutely possible with the
[00:40:53.660 --> 00:40:54.660]   Lord.
[00:40:54.660 --> 00:40:58.140]   Hebrews 11, just think about how powerful faith is.
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:01.380]   The strength that God gives to us through faith.
[00:41:01.380 --> 00:41:04.740]   I mean, individuals, I've seen it.
[00:41:04.740 --> 00:41:06.700]   Individuals who are deathly afraid of doing something.
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.500]   Like, "I could never confront my parents.
[00:41:08.500 --> 00:41:11.860]   I could never talk to that person through faith.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:15.580]   I could never speak in front of the church, give their testimony, and everybody in the
[00:41:15.580 --> 00:41:17.100]   room is crying because it's so moving."
[00:41:17.100 --> 00:41:18.100]   Right?
[00:41:18.100 --> 00:41:23.300]   But beyond that, the halls of faith, through faith, they left their home.
[00:41:23.300 --> 00:41:26.660]   Through faith, they fought nations and mighty kingdoms.
[00:41:26.660 --> 00:41:28.700]   Through faith, they abandoned everything.
[00:41:28.700 --> 00:41:34.260]   Through faith, they were stoned, tortured, and some sawn in half.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:37.180]   Think about how powerful faith is.
[00:41:37.180 --> 00:41:45.180]   And remember, because we just exited, came out of the Easter week, scripture says that
[00:41:45.180 --> 00:41:48.780]   the power of Christ's resurrection is in you.
[00:41:48.780 --> 00:41:53.080]   The incredible power of Christ's resurrection is in you.
[00:41:53.080 --> 00:41:58.100]   To persevere through suffering, to fight against every temptation, if you are struggling and
[00:41:58.100 --> 00:42:01.820]   trying to decide what's right to do, and you know what's right to do, but you feel that
[00:42:01.820 --> 00:42:04.700]   weakness, like, "I don't know if I can do it."
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.580]   The spirit of Christ's resurrection is in you to make those decisions.
[00:42:09.580 --> 00:42:15.820]   The spirit of Christ's resurrection is in you to make bold statements for Christ.
[00:42:15.820 --> 00:42:21.140]   I will say, like, again, I've confessed so many times, the fear of man sometimes is in
[00:42:21.140 --> 00:42:22.500]   me.
[00:42:22.500 --> 00:42:27.020]   And when I'm talking to somebody, I felt just the jitters, the butterflies in my stomach,
[00:42:27.020 --> 00:42:30.820]   and my voice quivering like I'm crying or something.
[00:42:30.820 --> 00:42:35.540]   And when I'm focused and I know this is my Lord, I can speak.
[00:42:35.540 --> 00:42:37.020]   I can speak truth.
[00:42:37.020 --> 00:42:41.780]   Because that truth of God is absolutely powerful to save.
[00:42:41.780 --> 00:42:45.140]   I want to encourage you again.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:47.260]   We have power.
[00:42:47.260 --> 00:42:49.820]   We have great, great power.
[00:42:49.820 --> 00:42:54.220]   And sometimes when I see people and they're in the midst of the sin, we get it.
[00:42:54.220 --> 00:42:56.620]   You feel weak.
[00:42:56.620 --> 00:43:02.780]   Here and now is particularly, especially a time for you to exercise this faith.
[00:43:02.780 --> 00:43:07.220]   There is an incredible spiritual power for you in the name of Christ.
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:12.540]   And so Apostle Paul is going to command us later in Ephesians 6.10, "Finally, be strong
[00:43:12.540 --> 00:43:16.460]   in the Lord and in the strength of his might."
[00:43:16.460 --> 00:43:25.340]   You know, I want to conclude with this last point, point number four, which is to say
[00:43:25.340 --> 00:43:28.100]   this.
[00:43:28.100 --> 00:43:34.500]   Sometimes I listen to prosperity gospel teachers because it kind of gets your blood boiling
[00:43:34.500 --> 00:43:36.980]   and then also gets your mind going like, "Ugh!"
[00:43:36.980 --> 00:43:38.860]   You know, "How do you convince these people?"
[00:43:38.860 --> 00:43:39.860]   You know?
[00:43:39.860 --> 00:43:43.660]   Well, what's funny is that some of the prosperity gospel preachers say the exact same statements
[00:43:43.660 --> 00:43:45.660]   that I just said like a moment ago.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:46.940]   "There's power in you.
[00:43:46.940 --> 00:43:49.300]   There's resurrected power in you."
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:51.580]   And you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:43:51.580 --> 00:43:55.780]   Now, why am I then not a prosperity gospel preacher?
[00:43:55.780 --> 00:44:02.500]   It's because although they may say similar things, we know that they end at, and that
[00:44:02.500 --> 00:44:07.180]   power is going to now do for you, your will.
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:13.680]   That power now is going to translate to you, my car, my house, my wife, my life, and maybe
[00:44:13.680 --> 00:44:16.220]   even my glory.
[00:44:16.220 --> 00:44:21.340]   Because when we take a look at Ephesians chapter 3, verse 20-21, the ending of this
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:26.460]   passage, Apostle Paul says, "Now to him who is able to do far more abundantly beyond all
[00:44:26.460 --> 00:44:31.220]   that we ask or think according to the power that works within us, you can stop there and
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:32.220]   wonder, 'Huh!
[00:44:32.220 --> 00:44:35.740]   God can do a lot more than what I even have asked.'"
[00:44:35.740 --> 00:44:37.780]   And prosperity gospels have used that.
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:41.580]   Gospel preachers have used that and said, "Oh, God's going to do wonderful things for
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:42.580]   you."
[00:44:42.580 --> 00:44:45.900]   But verse 21, we can't not read that.
[00:44:45.900 --> 00:44:50.900]   It says, "To him be the glory in the church and in Christ Jesus in all generations forever
[00:44:50.900 --> 00:44:51.900]   and ever.
[00:44:51.900 --> 00:44:52.900]   Amen."
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:53.900]   Right?
[00:44:53.900 --> 00:44:59.860]   The prosperity gospel preachers will use that and turn and twist and pervert everything
[00:44:59.860 --> 00:45:04.100]   to feed our blasphemous self-idolization.
[00:45:04.100 --> 00:45:06.140]   That's absolutely ridiculous.
[00:45:06.140 --> 00:45:13.060]   And as a matter of fact, that is such a blasphemous diminishing of the power of God.
[00:45:13.060 --> 00:45:18.820]   You're bringing God's power down to this when you think that God's power is relegated to
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:23.260]   buy you that car, that house, and what more?
[00:45:23.260 --> 00:45:28.780]   Because again, honestly speaking, all that is is actually the power of man.
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:33.700]   The vast majority of people in America, if they work hard and save, at least in the next
[00:45:33.700 --> 00:45:37.820]   five to ten years, they're going to be able to afford a vehicle.
[00:45:37.820 --> 00:45:39.220]   Right?
[00:45:39.220 --> 00:45:43.740]   And to say that you're going to exercise this faith and you're going to exercise your disciplines
[00:45:43.740 --> 00:45:49.660]   and you're going to seek the Lord in praise so that he can get you that car, that is such
[00:45:49.660 --> 00:45:54.260]   a gross undermining of God's power.
[00:45:54.260 --> 00:45:59.400]   We believe that God is going to strengthen us, to absolutely transform us into the image
[00:45:59.400 --> 00:46:01.460]   of Christ.
[00:46:01.460 --> 00:46:06.140]   He is going to move us through faith to transcend this world.
[00:46:06.140 --> 00:46:11.740]   And through faith, he is going to bring us home to his kingdom and eternally cause us
[00:46:11.740 --> 00:46:14.180]   to be perfect before his eyes.
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:16.300]   We are looking for so much more.
[00:46:16.300 --> 00:46:23.000]   And so I pray that when you have that insight, realize that when our minds and our faith
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:28.840]   is so sober unto the eternal, when our minds and faith are so sober into the plan of God
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:35.220]   and his redemption and the glory of the Lord, we actually find so much more solid ground.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:37.040]   We actually live in reality.
[00:46:37.040 --> 00:46:39.860]   We know what we're doing and why we're doing it.
[00:46:39.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   Everything starts to fit.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:43.860]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:46:43.860 --> 00:46:52.900]   Lord, I pray, God, that truly we would understand, but what's more, there would be conviction
[00:46:52.900 --> 00:46:53.900]   of faith.
[00:46:53.900 --> 00:47:02.060]   God, you know, right now I'm trying to teach and wrap up an incredible three-chapter section
[00:47:02.060 --> 00:47:08.700]   where you've described your incredible grace, the working of your might and power, all directed
[00:47:08.700 --> 00:47:14.220]   towards those who were previously enemies.
[00:47:14.220 --> 00:47:19.700]   And so, God, we want to thank you and praise you, Lord, for revealing all of that to us.
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.460]   We trust your heart.
[00:47:21.460 --> 00:47:25.060]   We receive with grateful hands all the mercies that you give.
[00:47:25.060 --> 00:47:27.660]   And Father God, it fills us.
[00:47:27.660 --> 00:47:29.780]   It causes us to be strong.
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:34.460]   I do pray that for every single person at our church, Lord, God, we would not simply
[00:47:34.460 --> 00:47:36.260]   have strength of know-how.
[00:47:36.260 --> 00:47:43.100]   God, that we would not simply have strength of ingenuity and good problem solving.
[00:47:43.100 --> 00:47:47.500]   I pray, Father God, that we would have the truth, strength of Christ and the faith that
[00:47:47.500 --> 00:47:48.900]   you call us to have.
[00:47:48.900 --> 00:47:54.780]   Lord, help us to live in such a fashion where it is so wise in your eyes and not the eyes
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:55.780]   of the world.
[00:47:55.780 --> 00:47:59.980]   And I pray, Father God, that we would live in such a fashion that is so empowered and
[00:47:59.980 --> 00:48:01.660]   strengthened by your spirit.
[00:48:01.660 --> 00:48:02.660]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ.
[00:48:02.660 --> 00:48:03.900]   In me pray, amen.
[00:48:03.900 --> 00:48:06.100]   (thunderous applause)
