[00:02:35.220 --> 00:02:37.380]   All right, let's gather ourselves at the tables,
[00:02:37.380 --> 00:02:40.500]   take a seat, and then we'll begin our Bible study time
[00:02:40.500 --> 00:02:44.180]   with a brief moment of prayer and praise.
[00:02:44.180 --> 00:02:46.300]   OK.
[00:02:46.300 --> 00:02:49.980]   All right, please bow with me for a word of prayer.
[00:02:49.980 --> 00:02:53.020]   Heavenly Father, we want to really thank you for the week
[00:02:53.020 --> 00:02:56.460]   that we had during Easter to join together
[00:02:56.460 --> 00:03:01.620]   in remembrance, in meditating and thinking about all
[00:03:01.620 --> 00:03:06.260]   the events of history, but more so just to celebrate, God,
[00:03:06.260 --> 00:03:09.100]   the power of the resurrected life of Christ.
[00:03:09.100 --> 00:03:13.420]   And I pray, Lord, that through the knowledge of the Son,
[00:03:13.420 --> 00:03:15.520]   through Father God, the appreciation that's
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:17.820]   in our hearts, you continue to empower us
[00:03:17.820 --> 00:03:20.300]   to live day to day in faith.
[00:03:20.300 --> 00:03:25.740]   Lord God, we want to ask that as we walk week to week,
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:28.980]   help us truly to be aware and conscientious about it
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:30.660]   and not to forget.
[00:03:30.660 --> 00:03:32.980]   And then, Lord God, we thank you for opportunities
[00:03:32.980 --> 00:03:35.500]   like tonight coming back to study your word
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.180]   and be in fellowship.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:40.100]   And I pray, God, that as a body, the collective faith
[00:03:40.100 --> 00:03:43.580]   that we exercise and, God, the worship that we lift up to you
[00:03:43.580 --> 00:03:46.220]   would be truly something desirable and pleasing
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:47.340]   in your sight.
[00:03:47.340 --> 00:03:48.720]   We lift this time up to you, Lord.
[00:03:48.720 --> 00:03:49.980]   It's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:03:49.980 --> 00:03:50.480]   Amen.

[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.800]   Crowned in majesty.
[00:04:36.800 --> 00:04:40.280]   Glorious prince of peace.

[00:05:32.120 --> 00:05:38.600]   Merciful high priest.
[00:05:38.600 --> 00:05:42.080]   Mother of the least.
[00:05:42.080 --> 00:05:45.560]   Generous and meek.
[00:05:45.560 --> 00:05:49.040]   Protector of the weak.
[00:05:49.040 --> 00:05:52.520]   Sacrifice to death.
[00:05:52.520 --> 00:05:56.000]   For us, your final breath.
[00:05:56.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   You died the world to save.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.480]   To overcome the grave.
[00:06:02.480 --> 00:06:05.960]   To overcome the grave.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:07.960]   Jesus.
[00:06:07.960 --> 00:06:15.920]   Jesus, lamb of God, how great you are.
[00:06:15.920 --> 00:06:21.400]   There is no other savior.

[00:08:28.060 --> 00:08:45.060]   Create in me a clean heart, O God,
[00:08:45.060 --> 00:08:55.060]   and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:08:55.060 --> 00:09:11.060]   Create in me a clean heart, O God,
[00:09:11.060 --> 00:09:21.060]   and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:09:21.060 --> 00:09:25.060]   Cast me not away.
[00:09:25.060 --> 00:09:39.060]   Cast me not away from Thy presence, O Lord,
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:52.060]   and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
[00:09:52.060 --> 00:10:08.060]   Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation,
[00:10:08.060 --> 00:10:18.060]   and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:10:18.060 --> 00:10:36.060]   Create in me a clean heart, O God,

[00:10:49.060 --> 00:11:02.060]   Cast me not away from Thy presence, O Lord,
[00:11:02.060 --> 00:11:16.060]   and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
[00:11:16.060 --> 00:11:32.060]   Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation,
[00:11:32.060 --> 00:11:41.060]   and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:11:41.060 --> 00:11:45.060]   Cast me not away.
[00:11:45.060 --> 00:11:58.060]   Cast me not away from Thy presence, O Lord,
[00:11:58.060 --> 00:12:12.060]   and take not Thy Holy Spirit from me.
[00:12:12.060 --> 00:12:27.060]   Restore unto me the joy of Thy salvation,
[00:12:27.060 --> 00:12:35.060]   and renew a right spirit within me.
[00:12:35.060 --> 00:12:43.060]   Amen.
[00:12:43.060 --> 00:12:45.060]   All right, amen.
[00:12:45.060 --> 00:12:47.060]   Just a few announcements for us,
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:50.060]   just of the things that are happening soon.
[00:12:50.060 --> 00:12:54.060]   This weekend, for those of you who are thinking about church membership,
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.060]   is the first class of our membership series.
[00:12:57.060 --> 00:13:02.060]   It's eight weeks long and starts 9 a.m. up in the--
[00:13:02.060 --> 00:13:06.060]   Actually, this time it's going to be in the youth group room.
[00:13:06.060 --> 00:13:09.060]   Please make sure that if that was something you were interested in joining,
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:13.060]   to sign up for it so that we can prepare enough binders.
[00:13:13.060 --> 00:13:17.060]   You can sign up by going online to beroeancc.com, looking at events,
[00:13:17.060 --> 00:13:22.060]   and then it has the link there, or you can just message Pastor Nathan directly.
[00:13:22.060 --> 00:13:25.060]   Additionally, for all the members, on the 23rd,
[00:13:25.060 --> 00:13:28.060]   we have our membership meeting plus service fair.
[00:13:28.060 --> 00:13:32.060]   And that will be an opportunity for you to visit with our service team leaders,
[00:13:32.060 --> 00:13:34.060]   connect with some of the people who are already serving,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.060]   and even if, let's say, you're not ready to jump on a team,
[00:13:37.060 --> 00:13:40.060]   just find out what's happening within various ministries.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:43.060]   So please make sure you mark that on your calendar.
[00:13:43.060 --> 00:13:45.060]   That day, there's going to be a fundraiser lunch
[00:13:45.060 --> 00:13:50.060]   where the summer team is going to prepare a quick lunch for us,
[00:13:50.060 --> 00:13:54.060]   and then immediately after at 1.30 is going to be the members meeting.
[00:13:54.060 --> 00:13:59.060]   The last thing I want to emphasize is please do sign up for retreat early.
[00:13:59.060 --> 00:14:04.060]   So we've made it so that the early bird special, so to speak,
[00:14:04.060 --> 00:14:09.060]   is ending in April because we have to book and reserve all the rooms early on,
[00:14:09.060 --> 00:14:14.060]   and because we're taking up so many of the rooms, we have to give them our head count.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:19.060]   So then once April ends, per person or per participant,
[00:14:19.060 --> 00:14:23.060]   the price is going to go up $35, $40, which is quite a bit.
[00:14:23.060 --> 00:14:25.060]   So look at your calendars.
[00:14:25.060 --> 00:14:30.060]   Make sure in August 11 through--I think it's 11 through 13, you take a look.
[00:14:30.060 --> 00:14:33.060]   Make sure you're clear on those dates and register early.
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:37.060]   All right, have the time of discussion, and we'll be back at 8 p.m.
[00:14:37.060 --> 00:14:39.060]   Thanks.

[00:58:47.060 --> 00:58:51.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:58:51.060 --> 00:58:54.060]   >> No, that's, so usually it's already on here.
[00:58:54.060 --> 00:58:56.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:58:56.060 --> 00:59:00.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:59:00.060 --> 00:59:10.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:16.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:59:16.060 --> 00:59:26.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:59:26.060 --> 00:59:28.060]   >> Where you just have it come from this?
[00:59:28.060 --> 00:59:43.060]   [ Background Discussion ]
[00:59:43.060 --> 00:59:45.060]   >> Okay, thank you.
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:49.060]   All right, if I can have your attention up here real quick.
[00:59:49.060 --> 00:59:55.060]   Let me pray for us, and then we'll get, we'll wrap up 3rd John.
[00:59:55.060 --> 01:00:01.060]   So that we can do a seven-week intense study on Philemon.
[01:00:01.060 --> 01:00:04.060]   All right, so let me wrap up 3rd John for us.
[01:00:04.060 --> 01:00:06.060]   Let me pray.
[01:00:06.060 --> 01:00:14.060]   Father, we're thankful that you've allowed us to just finish up these twin apostles, or twin epistles.
[01:00:14.060 --> 01:00:22.060]   And we thank you, Lord God, for causing us to think of the importance of hospitality.
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:30.060]   And we pray that tonight, as we just do a little wrap-up walk-through of this epistle,
[01:00:30.060 --> 01:00:33.060]   help us to really glean much from it.
[01:00:33.060 --> 01:00:39.060]   And whatever it is that you want us to remember, would you etch into our minds tonight?
[01:00:39.060 --> 01:00:43.060]   So would you help me to communicate clearly, effectively?
[01:00:43.060 --> 01:00:48.060]   And would you leave an indelible impression on our minds through your word?
[01:00:48.060 --> 01:00:53.060]   So we lift this time into your hands, and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:00:53.060 --> 01:01:00.060]   All right, so I included a little bit of last week's, last couple of verses there.
[01:01:00.060 --> 01:01:01.060]   Okay?
[01:01:01.060 --> 01:01:04.060]   And so this is pretty much up to verse 12.
[01:01:04.060 --> 01:01:08.060]   Verse 13 and on, it's God's inerrant inspired word.
[01:01:08.060 --> 01:01:13.060]   But I'm just going to focus up to verse 12 for now.
[01:01:13.060 --> 01:01:20.060]   And then the first thing I did was just organize it and then look through just different categories.
[01:01:20.060 --> 01:01:21.060]   Okay?
[01:01:21.060 --> 01:01:24.060]   So the purple bold, just the good guys.
[01:01:24.060 --> 01:01:28.060]   I just titled it "Good Guys," so that my eyes would go there.
[01:01:28.060 --> 01:01:31.060]   And then the green are the bad guys.
[01:01:31.060 --> 01:01:37.060]   Now, the Gentiles technically are neutral, but I just put them as bad for now.
[01:01:37.060 --> 01:01:42.060]   And then anything that is related to truth or anything that's related to God or of good,
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:44.060]   I put it in the blue highlights.
[01:01:44.060 --> 01:01:50.060]   And then everything that is green or anything evil, I highlighted in green.
[01:01:50.060 --> 01:01:57.060]   And a lot of what Diotrephus' actions entailed, we can see as evil.
[01:01:57.060 --> 01:02:01.060]   So I actually just kind of highlighted it like that.
[01:02:01.060 --> 01:02:06.060]   And then the red words are like significant words, like "therefore"s are important,
[01:02:06.060 --> 01:02:13.060]   "so that's" are important, "for this reasons" are important whenever you see them in the Scripture.
[01:02:13.060 --> 01:02:19.060]   And there's only one command in the whole chapter that's important.
[01:02:19.060 --> 01:02:22.060]   There's a "greet the friends there by name."
[01:02:22.060 --> 01:02:26.060]   That's a command, but I don't think that's as significant to the context.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:33.060]   So the "imitate" is the only main command in this whole chapter, in this whole letter.
[01:02:33.060 --> 01:02:35.060]   So that's pretty important.
[01:02:35.060 --> 01:02:40.060]   And because that's important, I just highlighted it, let it stand out.
[01:02:40.060 --> 01:02:48.060]   And I'm looking at the imitation of good and then the non-imitation of evil.
[01:02:48.060 --> 01:02:53.060]   And there's evidences of this, and there's consequences of this, so I just put those in yellow.
[01:02:53.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   So that's how I kind of just organize it visually.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:02.060]   And then the first thing I will hone in on is actually the "imitate" part.
[01:03:02.060 --> 01:03:06.060]   So here's the main command and the main imperative of 3 John.
[01:03:06.060 --> 01:03:12.060]   It's verse 11, and it's kind of a two-fold command.
[01:03:12.060 --> 01:03:15.060]   It's giving you a "do" and a "don't do."
[01:03:15.060 --> 01:03:25.060]   So John writes, "Beloved, do not imitate what is evil, but do imitate what is good."
[01:03:25.060 --> 01:03:28.060]   That's the main thrust.
[01:03:28.060 --> 01:03:30.060]   You guys tracking along?
[01:03:30.060 --> 01:03:32.060]   There's only one command here.
[01:03:32.060 --> 01:03:39.060]   So you want to make sure you're imitating the right thing and not imitating the wrong thing.
[01:03:39.060 --> 01:03:41.060]   And the consequences are pretty severe here, right?
[01:03:41.060 --> 01:03:48.060]   Because he's saying, "The one who imitates good, who does good, is of God.
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:56.060]   The one who does not imitate good, but imitates evil, who does evil, has not seen God."
[01:03:56.060 --> 01:04:00.060]   If I were to say, "Raise your hand if you want to be categorized in the first category,"
[01:04:00.060 --> 01:04:03.060]   100% of us would raise our hands.
[01:04:03.060 --> 01:04:08.060]   If I said, "How many of you guys don't want to be categorized as you've never seen God?"
[01:04:08.060 --> 01:04:10.060]   You wouldn't want that.
[01:04:10.060 --> 01:04:14.060]   So this command "imitate" is a very--it's like a hinge command.
[01:04:14.060 --> 01:04:16.060]   You got to get this one right.
[01:04:16.060 --> 01:04:18.060]   So that's the main imperative.
[01:04:18.060 --> 01:04:22.060]   And here are some questions that come to my mind.
[01:04:22.060 --> 01:04:30.060]   Is John speaking of evil and good generally or specifically?
[01:04:30.060 --> 01:04:36.060]   Is he talking about feed the hungry, tithe to the church?
[01:04:36.060 --> 01:04:42.060]   If you see an empty toilet paper roll in the bathroom at church, go ahead and refill it.
[01:04:42.060 --> 01:04:47.060]   If the trash is full, don't put stuff on top of it.
[01:04:47.060 --> 01:04:49.060]   Some of you guys do do that, right?
[01:04:49.060 --> 01:04:52.060]   Just throw it away.
[01:04:52.060 --> 01:04:57.060]   Good in general, is that what he's saying or is this very specific?
[01:04:57.060 --> 01:05:01.060]   It's a very important inductive question I will apply to this verse.
[01:05:01.060 --> 01:05:10.060]   The second thing is, is this imitation natural or is it supernatural?
[01:05:10.060 --> 01:05:13.060]   I can't imitate a cat.
[01:05:13.060 --> 01:05:15.060]   I can pretend a little bit.
[01:05:15.060 --> 01:05:20.060]   I can go--I can--I can do all of that.
[01:05:20.060 --> 01:05:23.060]   But it's not a good imitation.
[01:05:23.060 --> 01:05:28.060]   So is an imitation of God something a non-Christian can do?
[01:05:28.060 --> 01:05:30.060]   That's a question I would have.
[01:05:30.060 --> 01:05:38.060]   Is an imitation of Satan something a Christian actually is possible of doing?
[01:05:38.060 --> 01:05:46.060]   So is this a command or is this a description of a symptom of someone who's in line with the will of God,
[01:05:46.060 --> 01:05:48.060]   someone whose soul is prospering?
[01:05:48.060 --> 01:05:51.060]   So that's another important question.
[01:05:51.060 --> 01:06:00.060]   And similarly, are these things either prescriptive, meaning do this, or are these descriptive?
[01:06:00.060 --> 01:06:03.060]   Because you actually have both elements in this verse.
[01:06:03.060 --> 01:06:05.060]   Are you guys tracking?
[01:06:05.060 --> 01:06:08.060]   Don't imitate, do imitate.
[01:06:08.060 --> 01:06:15.060]   The one who doesn't imitate is of the devil or who hasn't seen God, or the one who does imitate is of God.
[01:06:15.060 --> 01:06:23.060]   So these are some pretty severe ramifications depending on how you imitate or don't.
[01:06:23.060 --> 01:06:27.060]   So here's the context.
[01:06:27.060 --> 01:06:33.060]   There's people that have gone out for the sake of the name, and we should support them.
[01:06:33.060 --> 01:06:35.060]   Good job, Gaius.
[01:06:35.060 --> 01:06:40.060]   I pray that your soul is getting along well, you're doing good, and you're helping them,
[01:06:40.060 --> 01:06:43.060]   because they went out for the sake of the name, receiving no help from the Gentiles.
[01:06:43.060 --> 01:06:48.060]   And so we want to be fellow workers of the truth, so great job.
[01:06:48.060 --> 01:06:52.060]   But diatrephas.
[01:06:52.060 --> 01:06:58.060]   So that is highlighted and brought to the front for me because it's very important, because this is a dude.
[01:06:58.060 --> 01:07:04.060]   John never calls him evil, he never calls him a non-Christian, but I feel like it's implied.
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:08.060]   But diatrephas is a context.
[01:07:08.060 --> 01:07:13.060]   So don't be like diatrephas, because that man hasn't seen God.
[01:07:13.060 --> 01:07:19.060]   Do not be like that is the implied context, is what I would glean.
[01:07:19.060 --> 01:07:23.060]   So he's putting this dichotomy.
[01:07:23.060 --> 01:07:27.060]   There's the good, and there's the not so good.
[01:07:27.060 --> 01:07:31.060]   Gaius would be good.
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:34.060]   Diatrephas would be evil.
[01:07:34.060 --> 01:07:38.060]   Good does stuff for the kingdom and for the name.
[01:07:38.060 --> 01:07:43.060]   Evil does stuff for self.
[01:07:43.060 --> 01:07:46.060]   If something is good, we're going to support, we're going to be fellow workers.
[01:07:46.060 --> 01:07:48.060]   Now the question is how, right?
[01:07:48.060 --> 01:07:52.060]   But if something is evil, we're going to call that stuff out.
[01:07:52.060 --> 01:07:55.060]   How? Because it's tricky.
[01:07:55.060 --> 01:07:57.060]   Because diatrephas is spreading lies.
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:03.060]   And when you've got two stories being told, a lot of times it's confusing to know which to discern.
[01:08:03.060 --> 01:08:06.060]   And if there's good, you imitate it.
[01:08:06.060 --> 01:08:09.060]   If there's evil, you don't imitate it.
[01:08:09.060 --> 01:08:11.060]   Good is of God.
[01:08:11.060 --> 01:08:13.060]   The evil fruit cannot and has not seen God.
[01:08:13.060 --> 01:08:22.060]   So I make this little chart so my mind can track the logic and the flow of the arguments that are here.
[01:08:22.060 --> 01:08:27.060]   So I'm calling him bad boy diatrephas.
[01:08:27.060 --> 01:08:29.060]   This is a bad dude.
[01:08:29.060 --> 01:08:32.060]   So what's happening?
[01:08:32.060 --> 01:08:39.060]   So first, John actually straight up judges this man's motivations.
[01:08:39.060 --> 01:08:42.060]   This man wants preeminence.
[01:08:42.060 --> 01:08:45.060]   He's all in it for his glory.
[01:08:45.060 --> 01:08:49.060]   And in return, he doesn't accept what we say.
[01:08:49.060 --> 01:08:52.060]   How dare he?
[01:08:52.060 --> 01:08:54.060]   But diatrephas is saying, who are you, John?
[01:08:54.060 --> 01:08:56.060]   How dare you?
[01:08:56.060 --> 01:08:58.060]   And that's how church divisions start, right?
[01:08:58.060 --> 01:09:03.060]   So he's going to come and call attention to diatrephas' deeds.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.060]   And what are the things that diatrephas has done?
[01:09:06.060 --> 01:09:08.060]   And there are four.
[01:09:08.060 --> 01:09:15.060]   One, oops, he unjustly accuses.
[01:09:15.060 --> 01:09:17.060]   He doesn't receive.
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:19.060]   He forbids and then puts them out of the church.
[01:09:19.060 --> 01:09:22.060]   Have you guys already kind of processed this in your own discussion?
[01:09:22.060 --> 01:09:24.060]   Yeah, okay.
[01:09:24.060 --> 01:09:29.060]   Now, diatrephas, he rejects authoritative truth.
[01:09:29.060 --> 01:09:32.060]   He rejects instruction.
[01:09:32.060 --> 01:09:34.060]   And what does that result in?
[01:09:34.060 --> 01:09:37.060]   He rejects this apostle of God.
[01:09:37.060 --> 01:09:39.060]   Okay?
[01:09:39.060 --> 01:09:52.060]   And the fruit of this rejection of the apostle's authority is slander, failure to be hospitable,
[01:09:52.060 --> 01:09:58.060]   hindrance of expressions of love, and then it seems like this man's unilaterally just
[01:09:58.060 --> 01:10:01.060]   excommunicating people.
[01:10:01.060 --> 01:10:03.060]   Are you guys tracking?
[01:10:03.060 --> 01:10:06.060]   My question is, how in the world does this man ever become a church leader if he's a
[01:10:06.060 --> 01:10:08.060]   church leader?
[01:10:08.060 --> 01:10:11.060]   If he's not a church leader, he's pretty bold.
[01:10:11.060 --> 01:10:15.060]   He's like, "I don't have any authority in the church, but get out."
[01:10:15.060 --> 01:10:16.060]   Right?
[01:10:16.060 --> 01:10:17.060]   That's a pretty bold man.
[01:10:17.060 --> 01:10:19.060]   So I'm assuming he's a church leader.
[01:10:19.060 --> 01:10:23.060]   How in the world did this guy get in there?
[01:10:23.060 --> 01:10:24.060]   Okay?
[01:10:24.060 --> 01:10:30.060]   So church leadership, here's an exhortation to church leaders.
[01:10:30.060 --> 01:10:35.060]   Paul's exhortation to Timothy reads, "Pay close attention to yourself."
[01:10:35.060 --> 01:10:38.060]   So your character, your life.
[01:10:38.060 --> 01:10:40.060]   "And to your teaching, your doctrine."
[01:10:40.060 --> 01:10:42.060]   So those two things, life and doctrine, life and doctrine.
[01:10:42.060 --> 01:10:47.060]   "Persevere in these things, for as you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself
[01:10:47.060 --> 01:10:48.060]   and for those who hear you."
[01:10:48.060 --> 01:10:55.060]   So the exhortation that Paul gives to his protege Timothy is, "Pay very careful attention,
[01:10:55.060 --> 01:10:58.060]   scrutinize your life, scrutinize your teaching."
[01:10:58.060 --> 01:11:04.060]   Titus, he says something similar, but he's describing an elder and an overseer.
[01:11:04.060 --> 01:11:10.180]   He says, "The elder, the overseer, he's one who holds fast the faithful word, which is
[01:11:10.180 --> 01:11:15.940]   in accordance with the teaching, so that he can do two things, exhort in sound doctrine
[01:11:15.940 --> 01:11:18.500]   and to refute those who contradict."
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:20.500]   So this is kind of across the board.
[01:11:20.500 --> 01:11:28.340]   All church leaders should be able to be beyond reproach in character and teach the truth.
[01:11:28.340 --> 01:11:30.540]   Teach sound truth.
[01:11:30.540 --> 01:11:33.260]   Sometimes with sound truth, you have to exhort.
[01:11:33.260 --> 01:11:40.140]   Sometimes in sound truth, you've got to bash the incorrect.
[01:11:40.140 --> 01:11:42.900]   So then here's Dietrichus.
[01:11:42.900 --> 01:11:52.660]   Was his problem more doctrinal or more behavioral?
[01:11:52.660 --> 01:11:55.220]   Who says doctrinal?
[01:11:55.220 --> 01:11:57.580]   Okay.
[01:11:57.580 --> 01:11:59.820]   One person.
[01:11:59.820 --> 01:12:02.700]   Who says behavioral?
[01:12:02.700 --> 01:12:03.700]   One person.
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:06.700]   Some of you guys are like, "This is a trick.
[01:12:06.700 --> 01:12:08.620]   It's not a trick question.
[01:12:08.620 --> 01:12:11.620]   His behavior sucks."
[01:12:11.620 --> 01:12:18.420]   His problem, first and foremost, is a moral character one.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:19.980]   It's an arrogance one.
[01:12:19.980 --> 01:12:21.260]   It's a prideful one.
[01:12:21.260 --> 01:12:24.820]   We don't know what he's teaching.
[01:12:24.820 --> 01:12:26.900]   So it's a behavioral one.
[01:12:26.900 --> 01:12:31.380]   But then the question is, how in the world did this man become a leader and a prominent
[01:12:31.380 --> 01:12:34.860]   figure in the church?
[01:12:34.860 --> 01:12:38.060]   And this is what church leadership really ought to look like in terms of character.
[01:12:38.060 --> 01:12:41.020]   Titus 1, 7 to 8.
[01:12:41.020 --> 01:12:48.340]   For the overseer must be above reproach as God's steward, not self-willed, not quick-tempered,
[01:12:48.340 --> 01:12:55.620]   not addicted to wine, not pugnacious, not fond of sordid gain, but hospitable, loving
[01:12:55.620 --> 01:13:01.660]   what is good, sensible, just, devout, self-controlled.
[01:13:01.660 --> 01:13:08.660]   What's the first quality of God's steward?
[01:13:08.660 --> 01:13:10.380]   Not what?
[01:13:10.380 --> 01:13:11.380]   Not self-willed.
[01:13:11.380 --> 01:13:17.260]   Diatrephes, the first quality that's mentioned about him is what?
[01:13:17.260 --> 01:13:18.380]   He's all about himself.
[01:13:18.380 --> 01:13:20.620]   He's all about his own glory.
[01:13:20.620 --> 01:13:23.940]   If his pride is hurt, oh, he's going to unleash war.
[01:13:23.940 --> 01:13:29.820]   If his ego is brushed against, he's going to start kicking people out of the church.
[01:13:29.820 --> 01:13:31.060]   How dare you oppose me?
[01:13:31.060 --> 01:13:32.060]   Do you know who I am?
[01:13:32.060 --> 01:13:33.060]   I am Diatrephes.
[01:13:33.060 --> 01:13:37.380]   I'm going to kick you out of the church.
[01:13:37.380 --> 01:13:43.980]   And I guarantee you he's going to do everything he can to protect his ego.
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:51.140]   And this is one of the first qualities there is for a church leader not to be self-willed.
[01:13:51.140 --> 01:13:58.380]   First Peter 5, 2-3, Peter's exhorting the pastors and the elders, and he says, "Shepherd
[01:13:58.380 --> 01:14:02.660]   the flock of God among you, exercising oversight."
[01:14:02.660 --> 01:14:08.380]   So, there is some degree of responsibility and authority, right?
[01:14:08.380 --> 01:14:14.260]   But not because you're forced to, not under compulsion, but voluntarily, according to
[01:14:14.260 --> 01:14:15.260]   the will of God.
[01:14:15.260 --> 01:14:18.220]   Not self-willed, but according to the will of God.
[01:14:18.220 --> 01:14:21.980]   Not for assorted gain, but with eagerness.
[01:14:21.980 --> 01:14:29.220]   Nor yet as lording it over those allotted to your charge, but proving to be examples
[01:14:29.220 --> 01:14:30.220]   to the flock.
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:37.360]   So, Diatrephes is not this kind of man.
[01:14:37.360 --> 01:14:42.660]   Are there Diatrepheses, do you think, in churches around us?
[01:14:42.660 --> 01:14:47.860]   Oh, for sure.
[01:14:47.860 --> 01:14:51.260]   How do they get there?
[01:14:51.260 --> 01:14:59.060]   Because people in church leadership are often put there because they're gifted, not because
[01:14:59.060 --> 01:15:02.900]   they're godly men.
[01:15:02.900 --> 01:15:08.740]   When someone is very good organizationally, when someone is very good at spinning a tale,
[01:15:08.740 --> 01:15:14.980]   when someone is very good at teaching, when someone has exceptional leadership qualities,
[01:15:14.980 --> 01:15:20.340]   before you test their character, you're tempted to just elevate them.
[01:15:20.340 --> 01:15:25.700]   But you know what Paul says in terms of even the leaders in the church?
[01:15:25.700 --> 01:15:29.580]   Don't put a new convert in there, because what happens to the new convert?
[01:15:29.580 --> 01:15:31.620]   They fall into the same temptation as the devil.
[01:15:31.620 --> 01:15:34.460]   They get poofy in the head, they think they're God's gift to Christendom, and next thing
[01:15:34.460 --> 01:15:38.980]   you know, they're a Diatrephes.
[01:15:38.980 --> 01:15:49.940]   So is it easy or is it difficult to test whether someone is self-willed or not?
[01:15:49.940 --> 01:15:56.460]   It's very hard, because you're going to give everybody a benefit of the doubt.
[01:15:56.460 --> 01:16:03.980]   But it's very difficult really to catch someone who has a desire to exalt himself.
[01:16:03.980 --> 01:16:08.220]   It's very hard to grab that and expose that.
[01:16:08.220 --> 01:16:11.820]   But you know what exposes this?
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:14.220]   Conflict.
[01:16:14.220 --> 01:16:19.180]   That's why another one of the qualifications of church leadership is temperance.
[01:16:19.180 --> 01:16:22.020]   You don't need temperance when people love you.
[01:16:22.020 --> 01:16:23.980]   When do you need temperance?
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:24.980]   When there's opposition.
[01:16:24.980 --> 01:16:30.420]   And a lot of times, true colors get exposed when there's opposition.
[01:16:30.420 --> 01:16:33.020]   True or false?
[01:16:33.020 --> 01:16:34.020]   False.
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:40.580]   So one of the things that we're looking at here in 3 John is you have a guy that was
[01:16:40.580 --> 01:16:50.540]   put in place too quickly, is my guess, who is now in it for his glory, his own namesake,
[01:16:50.540 --> 01:16:55.920]   his own ego, and not the glory of the Lord Jesus Christ.
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:17:00.580]   And he wields that abusively.
[01:17:00.580 --> 01:17:03.020]   But you know what's interesting?
[01:17:03.020 --> 01:17:07.380]   You know what Diotrephes' people are going to probably say?
[01:17:07.380 --> 01:17:10.620]   The Apostle John is abusive.
[01:17:10.620 --> 01:17:14.060]   The Apostle John is overstepping his bounds.
[01:17:14.060 --> 01:17:23.580]   How dare Apostle John come at us and our leader and say all of this stuff?
[01:17:23.580 --> 01:17:26.100]   Because Diotrephes, what is he doing?
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.360]   He's spreading.
[01:17:27.360 --> 01:17:32.700]   If you guys notice, all five translations, the wording is all different.
[01:17:32.700 --> 01:17:35.500]   Disparaging, spreading wicked lies.
[01:17:35.500 --> 01:17:36.940]   Do you guys notice that?
[01:17:36.940 --> 01:17:40.620]   Just look at it and you'll be like, "Oh, all the words are very different."
[01:17:40.620 --> 01:17:46.020]   There is an evil, sinister deception going on in the things that are coming out of Diotrephes'
[01:17:46.020 --> 01:17:47.560]   mouth.
[01:17:47.560 --> 01:17:51.660]   And he has to discredit John.
[01:17:51.660 --> 01:18:01.740]   So all this to say is if you ever desire to become an elder and overseer, you desire a
[01:18:01.740 --> 01:18:04.880]   lofty noble thing.
[01:18:04.880 --> 01:18:12.840]   And it has to be your character, and it has to be your soundness of doctrine, your teaching,
[01:18:12.840 --> 01:18:14.520]   and your consistency in your life.
[01:18:14.520 --> 01:18:19.560]   Now that's a scary task for those who are already in church leadership.
[01:18:19.560 --> 01:18:26.760]   And that, for you guys, for church leaders, you do need to lift the leaders up in prayer
[01:18:26.760 --> 01:18:31.400]   so that we don't fall into the same temptations as Diotrephes.
[01:18:31.400 --> 01:18:32.400]   Amen?
[01:18:32.400 --> 01:18:35.700]   Because that's not something that we...
[01:18:35.700 --> 01:18:42.600]   Nobody plans to be accused of exalting self.
[01:18:42.600 --> 01:18:50.160]   That happens when we're not scrutinizing our own lives and our teaching carefully.
[01:18:50.160 --> 01:18:53.800]   So this is actually a very sobering passage.
[01:18:53.800 --> 01:18:57.600]   The rest of it, I'm just gonna do a little rehash, review.
[01:18:57.600 --> 01:19:01.680]   Second and third John end almost exactly the same.
[01:19:01.680 --> 01:19:03.920]   I noticed that I made an error.
[01:19:03.920 --> 01:19:07.460]   In third John, it's actually paper and ink.
[01:19:07.460 --> 01:19:12.080]   In second John, it's actually with a pen.
[01:19:12.080 --> 01:19:13.080]   But...
[01:19:13.080 --> 01:19:14.080]   Okay.
[01:19:14.080 --> 01:19:17.080]   So it's not that different.
[01:19:17.080 --> 01:19:19.560]   There's a "see you later" in both.
[01:19:19.560 --> 01:19:24.400]   In third John, at the end, there is an imperative, another command, but that's not as significant
[01:19:24.400 --> 01:19:28.920]   as the imitate one, so I didn't put that in there.
[01:19:28.920 --> 01:19:34.200]   Before I give you the discussion questions, here are some announcements.
[01:19:34.200 --> 01:19:36.640]   Over there in the corner, there are gonna be...
[01:19:36.640 --> 01:19:39.920]   There's a lot of lost and found items.
[01:19:39.920 --> 01:19:45.320]   So go look through it if you've lost a sweater or a water bottle or sunglasses or something.
[01:19:45.320 --> 01:19:48.680]   See if it's yours, go pick that up.
[01:19:48.680 --> 01:19:54.240]   And if you guys are in the old cafe, you guys are all on the other side, every week the
[01:19:54.240 --> 01:19:56.980]   chairs are put that funky.
[01:19:56.980 --> 01:20:02.440]   And so there's been a request for you to look at the diagram that's on the wall and to put
[01:20:02.440 --> 01:20:07.440]   the room back together according to the diagram.
[01:20:07.440 --> 01:20:11.120]   For logistics of the Bible study next week, we're actually starting Philemon.
[01:20:11.120 --> 01:20:13.000]   It's gonna be seven verses.
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:17.320]   If you have a calendar on you, it actually says just verses one and two.
[01:20:17.320 --> 01:20:22.800]   The pastor, Mark, has called an audible and he says, "I wanna actually do verses one and
[01:20:22.800 --> 01:20:23.800]   one...
[01:20:23.800 --> 01:20:24.800]   Up to verse three."
[01:20:24.800 --> 01:20:27.440]   But verse three, it just says, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord
[01:20:27.440 --> 01:20:28.440]   Jesus Christ."
[01:20:28.440 --> 01:20:31.080]   So you're not gonna get too much inductive out of that 'cause it's in like five of the
[01:20:31.080 --> 01:20:32.080]   epistles, right?
[01:20:32.080 --> 01:20:36.920]   So verses one through three, what you wanna do is look for the main points of emphasis
[01:20:36.920 --> 01:20:42.600]   as you look through all 25 verses, come up with a general summary, and then try to outline
[01:20:42.600 --> 01:20:43.600]   the letter.
[01:20:43.600 --> 01:20:47.880]   These questions, I'm gonna copy and paste and put on the Facebook along with a template
[01:20:47.880 --> 01:20:50.880]   of all of Philemon and then the three verses.
[01:20:50.880 --> 01:20:53.360]   So all that will be provided for you.
[01:20:53.360 --> 01:20:56.720]   So here are some group discussions that...
[01:20:56.720 --> 01:21:00.520]   And I'm gonna explain a little bit why these are the questions that I would like you guys
[01:21:00.520 --> 01:21:02.580]   to try and discuss.
[01:21:02.580 --> 01:21:08.720]   If you are a Christian, how are you doing objectively in being a fellow worker of the
[01:21:08.720 --> 01:21:09.720]   truth?
[01:21:09.720 --> 01:21:12.920]   First of all, what is that?
[01:21:12.920 --> 01:21:15.080]   What does that mean for you?
[01:21:15.080 --> 01:21:20.640]   And are you faithful to it or are you saying later, not now?
[01:21:20.640 --> 01:21:23.200]   Right now, I can totally ignore this.
[01:21:23.200 --> 01:21:27.400]   No, but there's almost a strong exhortation, how are you gonna be a fellow worker of the
[01:21:27.400 --> 01:21:31.280]   truth and what keeps you from doing better?
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:32.280]   What are you waiting for?
[01:21:32.280 --> 01:21:35.880]   Those are the questions that I want you to ask for that.
[01:21:35.880 --> 01:21:46.700]   Number two, if a diatrophase was in our context and was being called out in a similar fashion,
[01:21:46.700 --> 01:21:50.960]   what are things you would need to be sober about?
[01:21:50.960 --> 01:21:54.700]   What are things that you ought to pray for?
[01:21:54.700 --> 01:22:01.560]   What are things to avoid so that you actually don't obstruct the work that's happening or
[01:22:01.560 --> 01:22:04.960]   the ministry that's happening?
[01:22:04.960 --> 01:22:12.000]   So my guess is in that church, there was some drama, right?
[01:22:12.000 --> 01:22:18.800]   This apostle of love, but previously he used to be called the son of thunder, came in and
[01:22:18.800 --> 01:22:21.840]   he called out diatrophases, my guess.
[01:22:21.840 --> 01:22:26.340]   But that probably had some messiness involved.
[01:22:26.340 --> 01:22:31.260]   So what would that look like for you if you were a bystander?
[01:22:31.260 --> 01:22:37.000]   The third one is reflecting on the study of the twin epistles, the second and third John,
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.320]   what are some truths you feel the need to apply to your life?
[01:22:39.320 --> 01:22:46.320]   And as way of review, just remember second John is, don't show hospitality.
[01:22:46.320 --> 01:22:52.920]   Third John was, do show hospitality and don't be a diatrophase.
[01:22:52.920 --> 01:22:59.240]   But then that's tricky, 'cause you have to discern in what context do I support, in what
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:02.420]   context do I call out an abstain?
[01:23:02.420 --> 01:23:08.160]   And so as you reflect through the last five weeks or so of our Bible study, hopefully
[01:23:08.160 --> 01:23:13.520]   number three is a very beneficial exercise as you answer that question.
[01:23:13.520 --> 01:23:23.280]   Okay, let me wrap us up in prayer and then we'll go back to our discussion groups.
[01:23:23.280 --> 01:23:29.320]   Father, second and third John have been just fruitful studies for us.
[01:23:29.320 --> 01:23:35.320]   And on the surface, it almost seems to have a contradictory thrust.
[01:23:35.320 --> 01:23:41.360]   The Lord, I pray that you would give us wisdom to discern the proper contexts in which to
[01:23:41.360 --> 01:23:48.120]   be hospitable and in which context to be an abstainer from evil.
[01:23:48.120 --> 01:23:56.200]   Lord, we need your wisdom, not just for these chapters of Scripture, but we need your wisdom
[01:23:56.200 --> 01:24:03.760]   also to know how to live day to day in obedience to the Word of God, obedience to the Spirit
[01:24:03.760 --> 01:24:04.760]   of God.
[01:24:04.760 --> 01:24:06.280]   So give us insight.
[01:24:06.280 --> 01:24:12.560]   Lord, your Word has said that solid food is for the mature who because of practice and
[01:24:12.560 --> 01:24:16.840]   training have learned to develop a skill of discernment.
[01:24:16.840 --> 01:24:23.360]   We pray that our church people will grow to be a discerning people because we fed hungrily
[01:24:23.360 --> 01:24:24.800]   off your Word.
