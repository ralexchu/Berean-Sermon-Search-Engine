[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.520]   We're really excited to have Claire with us. Come on up, Claire.
[00:00:03.520 --> 00:00:07.200]   Are you here? All right. What are we... Welcome, Claire.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.920]   What will we be talking about today?
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:12.640]   We're going to be talking about China, you know,
[00:00:12.640 --> 00:00:15.040]   just as everything has been all spicy.
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:19.760]   Yeah, well, just again, we're trying to make today about just easy, breezy topics,
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:21.920]   you know, the most easiest things to manage.
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:27.040]   So, we... Armaments, Ukraine. Let's go to China, sure.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:30.160]   Please welcome Claire.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:52.880]   We are going to actually keep this pretty apolitical today
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:59.840]   and maybe talk a bit about the parts about China that are less discussed in the headlines.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:03.200]   And, you know, Jason reached out and he said he wanted to
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.720]   really understand what were some problems.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:09.120]   And I wanted to see solved, that we wanted to see solved.
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:11.040]   So, I'm a property developer.
[00:01:11.040 --> 00:01:14.560]   I run Greater China for Heinz.
[00:01:14.560 --> 00:01:17.600]   We're the largest private real estate firm in the world.
[00:01:17.600 --> 00:01:22.160]   And we have an incredible Greater China team.
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:23.520]   I know I see these folks in the front.
[00:01:23.520 --> 00:01:27.520]   They're like, "Where is she? I can't possibly spot her in there."
[00:01:27.520 --> 00:01:38.480]   So, we have a team that is working across Beijing, Shanghai, Shenzhen, Dongguan, and Hong Kong.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:43.040]   And we get to work really across the real estate spectrum.
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:48.240]   So, we built the greenest skyscraper in China.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:53.680]   We built some of the first international service departments in the country.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.800]   And are doing some really interesting innovative projects, like in Hong Kong.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:04.080]   We bought a distressed hotel that we're turning into really a new kind of living,
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:09.040]   collaborative living that's super technology enabled for a young population there,
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:11.120]   where the average white collar young person,
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:15.120]   it takes them 20 years of salary to be able to buy an apartment.
[00:02:15.760 --> 00:02:20.560]   So, we get to approach these problems that are not unique to our part of the world,
[00:02:20.560 --> 00:02:25.280]   but often the solution is a combination of east meets west.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.040]   So, back to kind of what's the problem?
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:35.360]   Well, we're sitting right now in Miami, a place that is super exciting,
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:38.400]   thanks to a lot of the things that are happening right here
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:41.440]   that have been hyped by a pretty awesome mayor, right?
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:42.480]   What did he do?
[00:02:42.480 --> 00:02:47.920]   He got on Twitter and he talked to all of us about what this city had to offer.
[00:02:47.920 --> 00:02:51.440]   It had key ingredients, it had universities, it had an upward trajectory,
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:54.000]   it had young people looking to collaborate.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:55.600]   And at the end of the day, that's where we want to be, right?
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:58.480]   We want to be sitting together in awesome spaces like this,
[00:02:58.480 --> 00:03:03.360]   exchanging ideas with other interesting people.
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.880]   That's how you do cool stuff.
[00:03:04.880 --> 00:03:07.840]   And so, as property developers, we think,
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:13.600]   how do you create spaces where people want to be their best, right?
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.960]   Collaborate with others and build a better future.
[00:03:16.960 --> 00:03:20.480]   So, that's a lot of jargon, but what does that actually mean?
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:21.360]   Back to the problem.
[00:03:21.360 --> 00:03:24.560]   Well, first, these ingredients are pretty clear.
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.920]   I teach a class at Stanford on this called Who Owns Your City?
[00:03:27.920 --> 00:03:30.720]   And the students usually pick it up in the first 10 minutes.
[00:03:30.720 --> 00:03:33.360]   It's a place that has pretty good infrastructure.
[00:03:33.360 --> 00:03:35.760]   Can I get a job?
[00:03:35.760 --> 00:03:37.440]   Can I afford to live here?
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:42.160]   And is there cool cultural stuff that keeps it from being too bland?
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:47.680]   But then, you'd say, okay, well, cities can learn from each other, right?
[00:03:47.680 --> 00:03:49.280]   You can just take those ingredients and apply it.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:51.920]   And that's what Suarez did a great job of here.
[00:03:51.920 --> 00:03:58.400]   But we are living in a time where the East and West have never been more divided, right?
[00:03:58.400 --> 00:04:00.480]   And building a city, building buildings is really hard.
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.760]   It's like the most extreme version of hardware.
[00:04:04.400 --> 00:04:10.400]   So, as a property developer, we spend our time really thinking about what are the big macro
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:11.360]   trends?
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.040]   What are startups focused on?
[00:04:13.040 --> 00:04:15.360]   Where do they want to be?
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:19.760]   Because our spaces need to be relevant for 50, 70, 100 years.
[00:04:19.760 --> 00:04:23.840]   And we can't pick up our building and move it somewhere else.
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:29.840]   And so, you try to take the arbitrage of what's working in one part of the world and try to
[00:04:29.840 --> 00:04:31.680]   apply that to another and solve problems.
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:34.800]   And that's where you find great returns, but it's also where you build places that are
[00:04:34.800 --> 00:04:36.560]   going to be relevant for folks.
[00:04:36.560 --> 00:04:40.320]   And so, just a couple examples up here behind me.
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:43.360]   So, we talked about the living challenges.
[00:04:43.360 --> 00:04:47.600]   So, for folks to be able to afford a place to buy.
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:53.120]   But the concept of rental apartments, so like multifamily, if anyone lives in a multifamily
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:58.880]   building with one landlord, that isn't totally a thing in greater China.
[00:04:59.520 --> 00:05:06.880]   Often people are left to rent from an individual landlord, pay a deposit that's enormous, cost
[00:05:06.880 --> 00:05:12.240]   prohibitive and get quality of product that really is not up to what they would expect.
[00:05:12.240 --> 00:05:17.440]   And so, taking a very, in some ways, kind of Western concept and applying it in a place
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:22.880]   that technologically is probably about 10 to 15 years ahead in terms of what that average
[00:05:22.880 --> 00:05:23.840]   user is used to.
[00:05:23.840 --> 00:05:27.440]   They're used to unlocking a door with their phone.
[00:05:27.440 --> 00:05:29.520]   Their WeChat is their ID.
[00:05:29.520 --> 00:05:30.960]   It's the way they meet new people.
[00:05:30.960 --> 00:05:35.440]   They can physically shake hands on WeChat to introduce themselves to a friend.
[00:05:35.440 --> 00:05:37.280]   It's where they keep their coupons.
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:38.800]   It's how they pay their rent.
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.840]   It's how they pay their taxes in some regards, right?
[00:05:41.840 --> 00:05:43.840]   We don't have that in America.
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:46.960]   But if you're like me and you live in greater China, you do.
[00:05:46.960 --> 00:05:51.120]   And so, how do you combine those things together to create something that doesn't exist?
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:54.720]   You see up behind me a logistics building.
[00:05:55.680 --> 00:05:57.360]   But it's actually six stories high.
[00:05:57.360 --> 00:06:04.000]   Something we're developing that is a giant, almost like a refrigerator, but a high rise.
[00:06:04.000 --> 00:06:05.120]   Super tech enabled.
[00:06:05.120 --> 00:06:08.160]   And that's because, you know, they've got a lot of people.
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:14.000]   That building will be sitting within a 45 minute driving radius to 45 million people.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:21.040]   And yet, China only has a quarter of the cold storage capacity per capita that the US does.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:26.640]   Okay, it doesn't take a genius to see that this trajectory is, you know, lower left to upper right.
[00:06:26.640 --> 00:06:30.480]   And so, again, you're taking this concept of east meets west.
[00:06:30.480 --> 00:06:33.840]   Building up here, just behind me, is in Shanghai.
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:35.920]   It's about a million foot tower.
[00:06:35.920 --> 00:06:39.120]   You have a lot of those here in the United States.
[00:06:39.120 --> 00:06:43.280]   Big, fancy office buildings, you know, where people used to go to sit at their computers and do work.
[00:06:43.280 --> 00:06:50.640]   But this one is very different from one that you may have walked into earlier this week.
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.520]   This entire building is on WeChat.
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:57.200]   You can interact with the building on WeChat.
[00:06:57.200 --> 00:06:59.120]   You can interact with the landlord.
[00:06:59.120 --> 00:07:00.880]   You can interact with your other tenants.
[00:07:00.880 --> 00:07:09.680]   You can have chance encounters or organize a yoga trip in the afternoon with the people,
[00:07:09.680 --> 00:07:13.360]   with the space, using this digital interface.
[00:07:13.360 --> 00:07:15.920]   So, in a way, it's really combining the way we live right now.
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:18.960]   We live in a physical world, but so much of our idea sharing,
[00:07:18.960 --> 00:07:21.840]   our collaboration is happening in the air, right?
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:23.760]   In a digital experience that we can't see.
[00:07:23.760 --> 00:07:26.800]   And so, it's another combination of this east meets west.
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:32.560]   And so, what becomes a problem and an opportunity, a problem,
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:36.960]   when you sit in the middle of this world, like my team has the honor to do,
[00:07:36.960 --> 00:07:43.520]   is you see that there are all of these opportunities for us to be able to share this.
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:50.080]   Really, the best of what the west has to offer with the innovation that's happening on the ground
[00:07:50.080 --> 00:07:56.160]   in China, but it is so hard to talk about in this very divided world.
[00:07:56.160 --> 00:07:58.320]   And so, we like to take the positive side and say, you know,
[00:07:58.320 --> 00:08:00.640]   we're living in this world of like magic and Larry.
[00:08:00.640 --> 00:08:04.000]   And how can we make each other better?
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:07.920]   So, I thought I'd use just a few minutes and then we'll hang out with the besties
[00:08:09.840 --> 00:08:15.600]   to maybe share a story that maybe you all haven't read so much about,
[00:08:15.600 --> 00:08:19.280]   so that you get the benefit of knowing a little bit about what's happening over there.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:22.800]   And you can see an example of where sort of east meets west
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:25.760]   and that collaboration can make us all better.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:30.400]   So, up here is a gentleman you all will probably recognize,
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:34.160]   this is Deng Xiaoping, famous for really the opening up of China.
[00:08:34.160 --> 00:08:38.480]   And he was an experimenter.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.480]   You know, he had this vision of what China could be.
[00:08:40.480 --> 00:08:47.520]   And he saw what the importance of the physical world, the physical infrastructure,
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:52.400]   what a role that could play to enable the economy to jump further.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.560]   And so, the picture to the other side is Shenzhen,
[00:08:56.560 --> 00:09:03.920]   which in 1980 was barely a fishing village that had about 58,000 people,
[00:09:03.920 --> 00:09:06.320]   very few paved roads.
[00:09:06.320 --> 00:09:08.720]   And Deng Xiaoping, he was from Sichuan,
[00:09:08.720 --> 00:09:11.360]   so he really understood what it was like to not be from the big city.
[00:09:11.360 --> 00:09:18.800]   And so, he declared it a special economic zone, special economic zone, so "jinji teqi".
[00:09:18.800 --> 00:09:22.560]   And that meant that it would be this place to experiment with
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.400]   bits of capitalism, free trade, etc.
[00:09:26.400 --> 00:09:29.680]   So, what is it today?
[00:09:29.680 --> 00:09:32.400]   Well, first, there's that same road along progression
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:34.880]   just a few years after it was declared a zone.
[00:09:34.880 --> 00:09:37.600]   And then up here behind me is what it looks like now.
[00:09:37.600 --> 00:09:40.560]   Shenzhen is over 12 million people.
[00:09:40.560 --> 00:09:43.440]   The average age is 29.
[00:09:43.440 --> 00:09:47.680]   It's really the tech hub of China.
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:53.120]   So, companies like DJI, which makes 70% of the world's drones,
[00:09:53.120 --> 00:09:55.680]   they call this area home.
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:10:01.840]   And just within this area, if you were to go shortly from where this picture is taken,
[00:10:02.480 --> 00:10:07.840]   you'll have two of the world's five biggest ports by tonnage.
[00:10:07.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   So, how do you take that head start and turn it into something further?
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.080]   Well, they took a lesson out of the Book of the West,
[00:10:16.080 --> 00:10:21.280]   and they created something called the Greater Bay Area.
[00:10:21.280 --> 00:10:24.640]   Yeah, okay, you guys get it.
[00:10:24.640 --> 00:10:27.920]   So, what is the Greater Bay Area?
[00:10:27.920 --> 00:10:32.800]   Well, it is a collection of nine cities on the mainland side,
[00:10:32.800 --> 00:10:35.840]   some of which may be familiar to you guys.
[00:10:35.840 --> 00:10:38.160]   So, Shenzhen, as mentioned, and Guangzhou.
[00:10:38.160 --> 00:10:40.080]   Guangzhou is about 18 million people.
[00:10:40.080 --> 00:10:44.160]   Places like Zhuhai, do you all remember, you know, several years ago,
[00:10:44.160 --> 00:10:48.000]   there was this thing about China building the longest bridge in the world.
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:49.760]   Everyone's like, "Where is that?"
[00:10:49.760 --> 00:10:50.880]   Okay, it was in Zhuhai.
[00:10:50.880 --> 00:10:56.560]   And then, so nine cities on the China side, and then Hong Kong and Macau.
[00:10:57.120 --> 00:11:02.400]   And together, this area, it's about the size of West Virginia,
[00:11:02.400 --> 00:11:08.400]   today has a GDP that's sitting right around Canada and South Korea,
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:10.720]   okay, about 1.7 trillion.
[00:11:10.720 --> 00:11:16.960]   In 2017, they declared this Greater Bay Area name,
[00:11:16.960 --> 00:11:20.000]   and it was there to really back up a lot of the investment,
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:24.240]   frankly, that had already started to join these cities together
[00:11:24.240 --> 00:11:26.480]   to create a super region.
[00:11:27.280 --> 00:11:30.720]   So within that super region, they spent about $300 billion
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.920]   to build infrastructure to further connect it.
[00:11:33.920 --> 00:11:39.920]   So within just four years, they'd built 2,000 miles of speed rail,
[00:11:39.920 --> 00:11:41.840]   like high-speed trains.
[00:11:41.840 --> 00:11:46.480]   And we have like a little, you know, one from here that goes to Fort Lauderdale.
[00:11:46.480 --> 00:11:49.440]   You know, Texas is going to get one in the year 2090.
[00:11:49.440 --> 00:11:53.840]   And so, so what does that mean?
[00:11:53.840 --> 00:11:59.600]   That means that I can walk out of my office with my teammates in Hong Kong,
[00:11:59.600 --> 00:12:02.880]   which is right next to that big Ferris wheel thing that everybody recognizes.
[00:12:02.880 --> 00:12:07.680]   I can take one stop onto Metro in 13 minutes on a speed train.
[00:12:07.680 --> 00:12:11.440]   I could be in Shenzhen, or I could keep on going,
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:16.800]   and I could access about 23,000 miles of high-speed trains
[00:12:16.800 --> 00:12:20.640]   and get to Beijing, get to, you know, further than Guangzhou,
[00:12:20.640 --> 00:12:22.240]   get to Western China.
[00:12:22.240 --> 00:12:26.160]   It is amazing, and it is happening so quickly.
[00:12:26.160 --> 00:12:29.840]   And that number will soon be 40,000 as they continue to build.
[00:12:29.840 --> 00:12:32.080]   But it's not just speed trains.
[00:12:32.080 --> 00:12:35.840]   These are interconnected nodes with further Metro, right?
[00:12:35.840 --> 00:12:40.720]   With transit-oriented development on top of the meetings of these trains.
[00:12:40.720 --> 00:12:44.720]   So back to the so what.
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:50.560]   So we know that if you take cool people and put them in cool places
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:53.840]   and you give them an opportunity to interact, well, what can you do?
[00:12:53.840 --> 00:12:56.640]   So this area, again, the size of West Virginia,
[00:12:56.640 --> 00:13:01.120]   now with 70 million people who are all quite young.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:03.760]   And again, back to the ingredients.
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:07.760]   We talked about what sort of fosters innovation.
[00:13:07.760 --> 00:13:12.480]   Well, they've incentivized universities to put additional campuses here.
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:14.720]   And these are the best universities in China.
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:16.880]   So Tsinghua, Fudan, et cetera.
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:20.160]   They funded further life science.
[00:13:20.160 --> 00:13:24.560]   They funded further tax increment zones
[00:13:24.560 --> 00:13:29.840]   to encourage businesses to come and set up nodes of activity
[00:13:29.840 --> 00:13:32.880]   focused on areas of excellence.
[00:13:32.880 --> 00:13:35.200]   So remember, we talked earlier about in 1980,
[00:13:35.200 --> 00:13:38.880]   there were 58,000 people in all of Shenzhen.
[00:13:38.880 --> 00:13:43.200]   So just between 2010 and 2020,
[00:13:43.760 --> 00:13:48.240]   in one small neighborhood on the western side of Shenzhen,
[00:13:48.240 --> 00:13:51.360]   they filed 58,000 patents.
[00:13:51.360 --> 00:13:54.240]   It's pretty amazing.
[00:13:54.240 --> 00:13:57.280]   And that shouldn't be scary.
[00:13:57.280 --> 00:13:58.960]   That should be exciting.
[00:13:58.960 --> 00:14:01.440]   Guys, this is where we get innovation.
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.480]   This is how we get better.
[00:14:02.480 --> 00:14:05.840]   Back to the magic and Larry, right?
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:06.320]   Thank you.
[00:14:06.320 --> 00:14:07.360]   Yes, you can clap for that.
[00:14:07.360 --> 00:14:08.160]   You can clap for that.
[00:14:12.320 --> 00:14:14.880]   So what does that mean for us?
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:18.160]   What does that mean for folks who are sort of getting to work
[00:14:18.160 --> 00:14:23.280]   in this interstitial space in between getting to live within it?
[00:14:23.280 --> 00:14:29.520]   Up here, behind me, I have, I'll clear the visual for you.
[00:14:29.520 --> 00:14:32.720]   It's further disconnecting, showing these metro lanes,
[00:14:32.720 --> 00:14:38.560]   these trams, buses, et cetera, leading to these speed trains.
[00:14:38.560 --> 00:14:40.720]   Back down here, that's Hong Kong Island.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:43.440]   And then this takes you through a bit of the Bay Area
[00:14:43.440 --> 00:14:46.800]   before you get out to the rest of China.
[00:14:46.800 --> 00:14:49.120]   Well, why does it matter?
[00:14:49.120 --> 00:14:51.600]   It's because these things layer together.
[00:14:51.600 --> 00:14:58.080]   Okay, so China's e-commerce percentage is about 25% of their overall retail.
[00:14:58.080 --> 00:15:00.160]   Here, it's about 14%.
[00:15:00.160 --> 00:15:02.640]   Again, y'all are smart.
[00:15:02.640 --> 00:15:04.960]   We can see where this is going.
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.040]   So you can take some notes on the preview
[00:15:07.040 --> 00:15:10.240]   and see what things and trends may be coming here.
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:16.400]   In China, about 85-ish percent of their transactions are mobile.
[00:15:16.400 --> 00:15:18.320]   Here, that's barely 30%.
[00:15:18.320 --> 00:15:20.080]   Where is that going?
[00:15:20.080 --> 00:15:21.120]   How does that work?
[00:15:21.120 --> 00:15:22.800]   Again, you can see what's happening.
[00:15:22.800 --> 00:15:26.640]   Another is you can look at trends that are just part of the world there
[00:15:26.640 --> 00:15:28.000]   that haven't made it here.
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:33.760]   And you sit there and you're like, "Wow, what a chance to iterate."
[00:15:33.760 --> 00:15:38.560]   So the example there, again, we'll stick with shopping and retail,
[00:15:38.560 --> 00:15:39.680]   is social shopping.
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:42.640]   So this idea of streaming while shopping
[00:15:42.640 --> 00:15:45.760]   that's layered with a full experience and imagine what it can do.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:50.560]   Again, if you layer that on top of this WeChat platform
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:52.640]   we were just talking about, a place where I can go
[00:15:52.640 --> 00:15:55.360]   and I could make a new friend right now, you,
[00:15:55.360 --> 00:15:58.320]   by looking at you, showing my phone to you,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:00.720]   putting them together so we can introduce a product,
[00:16:00.720 --> 00:16:03.360]   introduce a lecture, a concept together.
[00:16:03.360 --> 00:16:05.280]   Imagine what we can do.
[00:16:05.280 --> 00:16:07.360]   Elon likes WeChat.
[00:16:07.360 --> 00:16:08.640]   He was just talking about it yesterday.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:16.000]   So the point is that we all have this opportunity to really,
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:20.160]   again, the headlines can be exciting, they can be crispy,
[00:16:20.160 --> 00:16:25.920]   but to look beneath them and to take an opportunity
[00:16:25.920 --> 00:16:28.160]   to further connect with the people.
[00:16:28.160 --> 00:16:33.520]   Because, again, those folks who are hopping on these trains
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.160]   for probably the equivalent of about 45 cents to get off the train,
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.920]   to get on the public transit here,
[00:16:39.920 --> 00:16:41.680]   going around and exchanging ideas,
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:44.320]   these people, most of them are not politicians.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:48.800]   Most of them are not big world global leaders.
[00:16:48.800 --> 00:16:52.800]   They're folks who are trying to create something for themselves,
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:54.800]   to create something for their children,
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:55.920]   to build a better world.
[00:16:55.920 --> 00:16:59.840]   So we're really all on the same team.
[00:16:59.840 --> 00:17:03.360]   So with that, bring the besties out, I guess.
[00:17:03.360 --> 00:17:05.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:05.040 --> 00:17:06.320]   Try not to get too spicy.
[00:17:07.040 --> 00:17:09.760]   All right, center stage for you.
[00:17:09.760 --> 00:17:10.400]   Right here?
[00:17:10.400 --> 00:17:11.760]   Right there in the middle seat.
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:12.160]   Oh, baby.
[00:17:12.160 --> 00:17:12.960]   Well done, well done.
[00:17:12.960 --> 00:17:16.000]   Be nice, guys, be nice.
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:17.200]   Of course.
[00:17:17.200 --> 00:17:20.320]   Well, Sax is in here, so of course we'll be nice.
[00:17:20.320 --> 00:17:22.080]   That's kind of by default.
[00:17:22.080 --> 00:17:26.800]   And meet our Ryan Peterson from Flexport.
[00:17:26.800 --> 00:17:27.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:17:27.520 --> 00:17:30.080]   Claire, maybe you guys, Ryan, Claire, Claire, Ryan.
[00:17:30.080 --> 00:17:32.640]   I'm introducing you two guys, Claire, Ryan, Ryan, Claire.
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:33.440]   And then you'll switch over.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:33.940]   Ryan.
[00:17:33.940 --> 00:17:35.060]   Hi.
[00:17:35.060 --> 00:17:35.560]   You guys met?
[00:17:35.560 --> 00:17:36.060]   Ni hao, ni hao.
[00:17:36.060 --> 00:17:36.560]   Ni hao.
[00:17:37.120 --> 00:17:37.920]   We follow each other.
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:46.640]   So what do we as Americans not understand about our rival?
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:50.960]   And what does our rival most not understand about us,
[00:17:50.960 --> 00:17:57.280]   in your estimation, having operated in both countries for so long?
[00:17:57.280 --> 00:18:01.280]   You know, the term rival is an interesting one.
[00:18:01.280 --> 00:18:06.160]   Obviously, I love sports analogies and came from the track and field world myself.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:07.520]   Claire was in the Olympics, guys.
[00:18:07.520 --> 00:18:09.360]   Claire was injured.
[00:18:09.360 --> 00:18:10.000]   Claire was injured.
[00:18:10.000 --> 00:18:15.120]   I used to go running sometimes, kind of fast, at the Olympics.
[00:18:15.120 --> 00:18:25.280]   But, you know, your job in the sport is to find the person who is better than you in some ways.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:30.480]   And maybe they're strong where you're weak, you're weak where they're strong.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.920]   You find each other and you shore up together.
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:41.200]   And I think that is what becomes so clear when you, you know, live there,
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:43.760]   when you live on the other side of the world.
[00:18:43.760 --> 00:18:48.880]   But maybe we're born here or, you know, I'm a minority.
[00:18:48.880 --> 00:18:53.600]   So I've maybe always lived in that interstitial space personally.
[00:18:53.600 --> 00:18:55.520]   Or even our team.
[00:18:55.520 --> 00:18:58.160]   Our team is very representative of modern China.
[00:18:58.160 --> 00:19:00.960]   We have people from nearly every province.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.800]   They're really across the education bracket.
[00:19:04.800 --> 00:19:07.280]   Highly trained engineers, but who might be quite young,
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:12.080]   to folks in their 60s who have really seen China evolve.
[00:19:12.080 --> 00:19:19.040]   And so I do think the thing that can get missed is almost that concept like we talked about,
[00:19:19.040 --> 00:19:22.720]   that as, quote, rivals, you know, they're not monoliths.
[00:19:22.720 --> 00:19:24.960]   Just as America is not a monolith, right?
[00:19:24.960 --> 00:19:26.320]   And we can take the best of each other.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:28.560]   So we're best of rivals in a way.
[00:19:28.560 --> 00:19:29.060]   There we go.
[00:19:30.720 --> 00:19:35.520]   Is there a model for the century for cooperation between the two nations that's enhancing to both?
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:39.280]   I think it's happening in enterprise.
[00:19:39.280 --> 00:19:40.320]   I really think it is.
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:47.760]   So when I look at, again, younger people, the products that they use
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:54.240]   or the things that the young tech, you know, entrepreneurs in China are working on versus here,
[00:19:54.240 --> 00:19:56.880]   they're approaching a lot of the same problems, right?
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:04.480]   So on the social side, you know, looking at Douyin and what made it so catchy, right?
[00:20:04.480 --> 00:20:05.840]   Explain what it is for us.
[00:20:05.840 --> 00:20:07.600]   It's TikTok.
[00:20:07.600 --> 00:20:08.640]   It's TikTok.
[00:20:08.640 --> 00:20:12.640]   And back to that one about, you know, cheat codes and a preview, you know,
[00:20:12.640 --> 00:20:15.200]   Douyin was popular years ago.
[00:20:15.200 --> 00:20:22.720]   And so, you know, I remember first looking at the app and being like, wow, this is very catchy.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:26.800]   And there's effectively no difference between Douyin and TikTok.
[00:20:26.800 --> 00:20:29.680]   Read and write Mandarin fluently as well as speak it?
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.320]   Well, you will never confuse me for a fukou.
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:32.820]   Fluently enough.
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.400]   I have a lot of work to do.
[00:20:34.400 --> 00:20:36.800]   But, you know, enough to get by.
[00:20:36.800 --> 00:20:41.680]   And so when you do business in China, do you conduct it in English or do you conduct it in Mandarin?
[00:20:41.680 --> 00:20:44.400]   Yeah, so with the team, we work fully across what's appropriate
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:46.640]   because we also work in Hong Kong where it's Cantonese.
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:47.200]   Right.
[00:20:47.200 --> 00:20:52.080]   But all of my communications that go out to my full team, everything in full team is in Mandarin.
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:56.880]   We do have a large part of our team that only functions within Mandarin.
[00:20:56.880 --> 00:21:00.320]   So when you're, for example, like, you know, you showed some of these buildings.
[00:21:00.320 --> 00:21:04.800]   And the idea that came to me is this is a massive coordination problem that's almost
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.560]   impossible in the United States, which is if you have this idea of like this living,
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.840]   breathing, monolithic building that is connected via the Internet,
[00:21:11.840 --> 00:21:17.760]   it probably would be 50 organizations in the United States that would have to have a say or want to say.
[00:21:18.720 --> 00:21:25.040]   The perception that we get is there is a individual that can effectively make that
[00:21:25.040 --> 00:21:28.480]   right decision in China, whether it's at the city level or at the state level.
[00:21:28.480 --> 00:21:29.520]   Is that how it's really like?
[00:21:29.520 --> 00:21:31.600]   Like when you guys have super ambitious ideas,
[00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:36.400]   is there one place you go to and then it just kind of all gets decided?
[00:21:36.400 --> 00:21:39.680]   Or is it just like here where it's messy?
[00:21:39.680 --> 00:21:44.000]   So it's kind of neither, actually.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.680]   And this is where I think it takes the best of both,
[00:21:48.240 --> 00:21:51.040]   which is at a local level.
[00:21:51.040 --> 00:21:55.760]   So you have a local, we have a party secretary, you have a block leader,
[00:21:55.760 --> 00:21:59.360]   and ultimately it goes all the way up to the big guy.
[00:21:59.360 --> 00:22:02.720]   But China does this amazing thing.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:04.240]   They have a five-year plan.
[00:22:04.240 --> 00:22:06.080]   They call it the five-year plan.
[00:22:06.080 --> 00:22:12.800]   Last year was the 14th five-year plan, and it sets KPIs and areas of focus for the entire country.
[00:22:13.440 --> 00:22:17.760]   And those are things around carbon neutrality, education,
[00:22:17.760 --> 00:22:21.040]   care for seniors, agriculture, industry.
[00:22:21.040 --> 00:22:24.480]   And it's a lot like for you guys who are running companies,
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:27.360]   setting goals and how are you going to get there, what's the roadmap?
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:29.120]   But that filters all the way down.
[00:22:29.120 --> 00:22:36.240]   And so at a local level, those KPIs for the local leader are,
[00:22:36.240 --> 00:22:38.960]   how did you make your district greener?
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.680]   How did you increase revenue from higher quality services and technologically advanced companies?
[00:22:45.680 --> 00:22:47.920]   - But what happens if you don't achieve it?
[00:22:47.920 --> 00:22:50.640]   You get fired, you get kicked out of the party.
[00:22:50.640 --> 00:22:53.600]   What is the mechanism of reward?
[00:22:53.600 --> 00:22:56.640]   - Yeah, well, it's quite high accountability.
[00:22:56.640 --> 00:23:01.200]   And so if you perform very well within that system as a leader,
[00:23:01.200 --> 00:23:04.800]   then you can move to higher and more advanced posts to a bigger city.
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:05.520]   - City mayor becomes a...
[00:23:05.520 --> 00:23:11.840]   - Right, so yeah, so from a block to a bigger city to a higher, up to a higher...
[00:23:11.840 --> 00:23:15.840]   - Your career stalls out if you don't hit them, but it gets accelerated if you exceed them.
[00:23:15.840 --> 00:23:21.680]   - Right, and so that creates a very interesting set of opportunities.
[00:23:21.680 --> 00:23:26.240]   And so to put it to maybe a tangible example is,
[00:23:26.240 --> 00:23:30.000]   so for the things that are really great for communities,
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:33.280]   like park space or building a building that's green.
[00:23:34.480 --> 00:23:36.720]   The last building that I showed up there is right,
[00:23:36.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   sits right on top of a Metro and is next to a natural history museum.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:47.200]   And we needed to work with the local government to ensure that we were relating to the area
[00:23:47.200 --> 00:23:49.760]   properly, creating, like leaving it better than we found it.
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:54.240]   We look at projects where you can't do the project
[00:23:54.240 --> 00:23:56.960]   unless you show that it's going to be green and additive
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.440]   or restore historic buildings in the area.
[00:24:00.160 --> 00:24:05.840]   There's a real handshake there that I firmly believe creates better outcomes.
[00:24:05.840 --> 00:24:07.120]   I know our team would say the same thing.
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:13.040]   - Claire, what's going to happen with the capital markets for your business with Evergrande
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:16.720]   and like some of these big kind of property developers that have had major debt problems?
[00:24:16.720 --> 00:24:18.640]   And have you seen that already flowing over?
[00:24:18.640 --> 00:24:21.840]   And you understand the market very well, you probably are able to navigate this,
[00:24:21.840 --> 00:24:25.200]   but the foreign capital and other investors like
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:28.240]   might group everybody into the same block and get scared off.
[00:24:28.240 --> 00:24:31.520]   - Sure, sure. So certainly we get a lot of questions,
[00:24:31.520 --> 00:24:37.440]   but it's another one where the headlines out versus inside the country, certainly
[00:24:37.440 --> 00:24:41.680]   the built environment, the construction and the real estate industries,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:45.120]   if you combine that all together, you've got about 27% of the economy.
[00:24:45.120 --> 00:24:48.560]   If you include the full integrated stack,
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:53.840]   one of the things in five-year plan is to diversify away from that in a way.
[00:24:55.600 --> 00:25:00.560]   But is Evergrande and the other developers,
[00:25:00.560 --> 00:25:06.160]   the real focus at the local and the higher level is to help the regular people
[00:25:06.160 --> 00:25:12.240]   get good on their deposits and ultimately get the homes that they were promised.
[00:25:12.240 --> 00:25:16.560]   So it's very interesting for developers like us and acquisitions people,
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:19.040]   as for some of those smaller developers who got into trouble.
[00:25:19.040 --> 00:25:21.600]   - Has there been a bailout? Is that the wrong word,
[00:25:21.600 --> 00:25:23.600]   the way that it's been characterized in the US media,
[00:25:23.600 --> 00:25:26.720]   that the Chinese government had to step in, shore up the balance sheet,
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:29.840]   make sure Evergrande wouldn't default on some of their loans?
[00:25:29.840 --> 00:25:33.840]   - I think there was a concern that there would be an entire meltdown
[00:25:33.840 --> 00:25:37.440]   of the full Chinese economy, which is not what we feel on the ground.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:40.960]   And I think if anything, it's created a set of opportunities
[00:25:40.960 --> 00:25:44.000]   to really level set, especially on the living sector.
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   It's really accelerated some policies to make it easier to build
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:53.840]   and to create rental housing, which creates more access,
[00:25:53.840 --> 00:25:58.000]   which therefore maybe takes away some of the pressure on the condominium system.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:06.960]   For the debt markets to create a space that is maybe taking on projects
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:10.480]   that are appropriate for the system, a little bit, again,
[00:26:10.480 --> 00:26:13.760]   more diversification and development in the right places in the right markets.
[00:26:13.760 --> 00:26:17.840]   - When we look at the relationship between the United States and China,
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:24.640]   we've had 300, 400, 500 million people come out of abject poverty on the planet
[00:26:24.640 --> 00:26:26.720]   because of this great engagement.
[00:26:26.720 --> 00:26:29.360]   I don't know if that's a term, but I'll call it the great engagement.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:32.640]   We started using their factories. We started making iPhones there.
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.640]   This has created, despite all of the hand-wringing about the relationship
[00:26:38.640 --> 00:26:43.120]   and all the various issues on both sides, a lot less suffering in the world.
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:44.160]   - Absolutely.
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:47.200]   - And so there is something that I think we don't recognize sometimes
[00:26:47.200 --> 00:26:49.360]   is that people who are living for under a dollar a day,
[00:26:49.360 --> 00:26:51.760]   300, 400, 500 million of them are now gone.
[00:26:51.760 --> 00:26:56.160]   And that leaves some areas in Africa and Southeast Asia
[00:26:56.160 --> 00:27:00.400]   that we still need to do that work, which paradoxically or ironically,
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:02.160]   it seems like China is doing in Africa.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:06.000]   What I'm curious about is what you're seeing on the ground
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:08.880]   with their middle class, which to me seems analogous
[00:27:08.880 --> 00:27:11.520]   to what we went through in the '30s, '40s, and '50s,
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:16.640]   this establishment of a middle class, which then established education
[00:27:16.640 --> 00:27:21.840]   and prosperity for the decades to come, and specifically for the boomers and Gen X.
[00:27:21.840 --> 00:27:25.680]   So tell us about that middle class that's emerging.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.640]   We hear about it.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:27.200]   - Yeah.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:29.520]   - But how many of them are there?
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:32.800]   And qualitatively, what do they want from life?
[00:27:32.800 --> 00:27:37.520]   - Yeah. Well, Jason, in a word, it's incredible, right?
[00:27:37.520 --> 00:27:43.120]   Like, again, I talk about infrastructure so much because you see it up there, right?
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:46.880]   China's only as urbanized as the US was in about 1950.
[00:27:46.880 --> 00:27:49.120]   So we read a lot about these--
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:49.360]   - Today.
[00:27:49.360 --> 00:27:50.560]   - Today. Today.
[00:27:50.560 --> 00:27:52.720]   So we read a lot about these--
[00:27:52.720 --> 00:27:53.760]   - Bullet trains.
[00:27:53.760 --> 00:27:54.720]   - Right.
[00:27:54.720 --> 00:27:58.880]   And so that leads to this incredible consolidation of people to cities
[00:27:58.880 --> 00:28:01.120]   and younger people to cities.
[00:28:01.120 --> 00:28:06.000]   It's a demographic spark that maybe gets talked about a little bit less.
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:10.480]   But also, if you look at the change that that person you're talking about
[00:28:10.480 --> 00:28:12.240]   has seen in their lifetime.
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:17.680]   So they went from a rural lifestyle, frankly, most of them,
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.280]   in something of a village setting that had not changed in decades,
[00:28:21.280 --> 00:28:27.600]   to this future world that in many ways can only be imagined in movies.
[00:28:27.600 --> 00:28:31.920]   And so I think, you know, I sort of struggle to put it into terms
[00:28:31.920 --> 00:28:34.160]   because you ask, you know, what do they want?
[00:28:34.160 --> 00:28:35.680]   What are they looking towards?
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:39.520]   And I'd say, you know, to use a personal example, right?
[00:28:39.520 --> 00:28:40.800]   I'm the luckiest girl in the world.
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:44.320]   I get to live in this amazing place and work with this incredible team.
[00:28:44.320 --> 00:28:48.240]   And, you know, yet, you know, my parents, you know,
[00:28:48.240 --> 00:28:50.960]   graduated in a fully segregated world.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:56.720]   The elder people, when they were growing up, were not just slaves.
[00:28:56.720 --> 00:28:59.600]   They were the slaves that we talk about on Juneteenth.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:03.200]   The ones in Galveston who walked across the bridge
[00:29:03.200 --> 00:29:06.880]   and followed railroad tracks to Houston, Texas, right?
[00:29:06.880 --> 00:29:07.840]   That's amazing.
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:09.280]   (audience applauding)
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:10.400]   That is amazing.
[00:29:11.120 --> 00:29:17.600]   And so I think when a generation or a collection of generations
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:21.360]   sees that amount of change, what they want is,
[00:29:21.360 --> 00:29:23.200]   first of all, they're grateful, but what do they want?
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:26.240]   They want to be able to build and create and be people.
[00:29:26.240 --> 00:29:27.360]   - Themselves. - Yeah.
[00:29:27.360 --> 00:29:28.160]   - I have a question.
[00:29:28.160 --> 00:29:33.440]   Japan in the '80s had a moment where everything came together for that country.
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:36.720]   Great population growth, great economic growth,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:39.200]   great systems like Kaizen and all of this other stuff
[00:29:39.200 --> 00:29:40.720]   that they would export.
[00:29:40.720 --> 00:29:45.200]   And the headlines in the '80s was Japan was taking over the United States
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:46.960]   or Japan was going to lap the United States.
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.200]   But really, one of the biggest things that it had working against it
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:53.680]   was a demographic wave, right?
[00:29:53.680 --> 00:29:56.000]   And you had massive negative birth rate
[00:29:56.000 --> 00:29:59.360]   that has really compounded Japan's stagnation.
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:03.680]   China is on the precipice of this because of this One China policy.
[00:30:03.680 --> 00:30:05.760]   I think the stat that I saw, which is stunning,
[00:30:05.760 --> 00:30:08.000]   is there's 1.2 billion people in China.
[00:30:08.800 --> 00:30:09.440]   1.4.
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:13.760]   By 2100, it's going to be around 600 million.
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:18.720]   If that's true, the point is just that there's a real issue.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:20.720]   - Yeah. - Is there something
[00:30:20.720 --> 00:30:25.040]   in these five-year plans around how to become sort of more culturally integrated
[00:30:25.040 --> 00:30:26.400]   with the rest of the world?
[00:30:26.400 --> 00:30:29.680]   You know, meaning how do you use immigration as an example
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:32.560]   to subsidize some of the negative birth rate?
[00:30:32.560 --> 00:30:35.440]   Do you teach English more so that you're more integrated
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.720]   into the world economy?
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:37.200]   All of these things.
[00:30:37.200 --> 00:30:38.160]   Can you just talk about that?
[00:30:38.160 --> 00:30:38.960]   - Mm-hmm.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:44.480]   So first, I think the urbanization trend
[00:30:44.480 --> 00:30:48.000]   of folks consolidating to the cities really can't be overstated,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.240]   just in the way that it shifts sort of how the country will work
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:53.600]   and what's happening on the ground.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:57.280]   You know, it's still relatively early days,
[00:30:57.280 --> 00:31:00.240]   but when we look at things like Belt and Road,
[00:31:00.240 --> 00:31:04.160]   you know, as I walk around Beijing and I compare it to,
[00:31:04.160 --> 00:31:06.560]   you know, when we first started there
[00:31:06.560 --> 00:31:09.200]   or when we were working with capital partners there,
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:12.080]   I see a lot more brown faces-- - Really?
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:14.160]   - --going to the universities around Beijing.
[00:31:14.160 --> 00:31:15.920]   Now, these are still-- - Explain what Belt and Road is
[00:31:15.920 --> 00:31:17.520]   for folks who maybe haven't heard the term.
[00:31:17.520 --> 00:31:18.720]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:31:18.720 --> 00:31:20.560]   So many places you guys can read about it.
[00:31:20.560 --> 00:31:24.080]   And before I forget, talking about sort of just--
[00:31:24.080 --> 00:31:25.920]   I know everybody loves recommendations here.
[00:31:25.920 --> 00:31:28.560]   So if you haven't read Dahlia's latest book
[00:31:28.560 --> 00:31:31.440]   on changing world order, or there's actually a great--
[00:31:31.440 --> 00:31:31.920]   (audience applauding)
[00:31:31.920 --> 00:31:32.480]   You read it!
[00:31:32.480 --> 00:31:33.200]   (laughing)
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:34.640]   - Freeberg made us all read it. - She read it.
[00:31:34.640 --> 00:31:35.840]   - Freeberg made us read it. - Yeah, I see.
[00:31:35.840 --> 00:31:36.640]   - Freeberg made us read it. - Yeah, exactly.
[00:31:36.640 --> 00:31:37.520]   - Freeberg talked about it-- - That's true.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:39.280]   - --every podcast for the last 20, as you know.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:40.640]   - So you've gotta read it.
[00:31:40.640 --> 00:31:42.000]   Listen to your besties.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:45.280]   There's also a very good illustration of it--
[00:31:45.280 --> 00:31:45.520]   - Video, yeah.
[00:31:45.520 --> 00:31:46.960]   - --as you guys have talked about.
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.040]   - Sunrise of the Sunset.
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.360]   - But, you know, do read that,
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:53.840]   because China's been a major participant
[00:31:53.840 --> 00:31:54.960]   in the global South.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.720]   So, you know, the short version of Belt and Road
[00:31:56.720 --> 00:32:00.800]   is working really across a set of countries
[00:32:00.800 --> 00:32:03.280]   around Southeast Asia and Africa,
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.600]   bringing in infrastructure,
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:06.640]   and kind of what it sounds like,
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:11.440]   roads, ports, airports, et cetera,
[00:32:11.440 --> 00:32:13.520]   really building out this network
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:15.600]   for that part of the world.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:18.320]   But I think what gets sort of bumped over on that
[00:32:18.320 --> 00:32:21.600]   is, again, things like this.
[00:32:21.600 --> 00:32:25.600]   So folks coming to China to be educated,
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.760]   the number of folks on the African continent
[00:32:27.760 --> 00:32:29.440]   now learning Chinese.
[00:32:29.440 --> 00:32:32.800]   And again, I think this is something that is exciting.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.240]   At the end of the day,
[00:32:34.240 --> 00:32:38.240]   the opportunity to further exchange,
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.440]   to lift more people out of poverty,
[00:32:41.440 --> 00:32:43.280]   to create further infrastructure.
[00:32:43.280 --> 00:32:45.280]   - Claire, I was hoping you would stay with us
[00:32:45.280 --> 00:32:48.240]   and be a bestie for Ryan, who's the next speaker.
[00:32:48.240 --> 00:32:50.080]   Would you be willing to help us interview Ryan?
[00:32:50.080 --> 00:32:51.520]   - I would be honored.
[00:32:51.520 --> 00:32:52.640]   - You guys wanna switch seats?
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.000]   - No, no, there we are.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:54.320]   - Oh, there we are.
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.440]   - Oh, yes, switch seats.
[00:32:55.440 --> 00:32:55.760]   - Switch seats.
[00:32:55.760 --> 00:32:56.160]   - Okay.
[00:32:56.160 --> 00:32:56.880]   - Yeah, you'd be better.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:32:58.800]   - Get in, I warmed it up for you.
[00:32:58.800 --> 00:32:59.680]   - And you're the guestie.
[00:32:59.680 --> 00:33:02.080]   I like it, I like it.
[00:33:02.080 --> 00:33:05.040]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:05.040 --> 00:33:06.080]   So give it up for Claire.
[00:33:06.080 --> 00:33:08.880]   Now, Ryan, congratulations.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.000]   CNBC does their top innovator
[00:33:12.000 --> 00:33:14.800]   of private company awards every year.
[00:33:14.800 --> 00:33:17.600]   And you made it to the top 50 list today.
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:20.080]   I didn't check which ranking you got,
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.640]   but being on the list in and of itself is a big win.
[00:33:22.640 --> 00:33:24.000]   What do they call it, disruptors list?
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:25.600]   - Disruptor 50.
[00:33:25.600 --> 00:33:28.320]   And my view of these lists is you should never share any list
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.160]   about your company unless you're number one.
[00:33:30.160 --> 00:33:31.360]   And we were number one this morning.
[00:33:31.360 --> 00:33:34.000]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:34.500]   - Well done.
[00:33:34.500 --> 00:33:38.720]   You truly helped us navigate, I think,
[00:33:38.720 --> 00:33:42.400]   the challenge of us as besties
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.720]   and the audience understanding supply chain.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:45.360]   We appreciate that.
[00:33:45.360 --> 00:33:46.800]   You've been on the show twice, I think, or?
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:47.680]   - Just once so far.
[00:33:47.680 --> 00:33:48.720]   - Just once so far, and then here.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:50.160]   This is your second time on the show.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:53.520]   - And apologies, I was filming the interview for that
[00:33:53.520 --> 00:33:55.040]   during Palmer's talk this morning.
[00:33:55.040 --> 00:33:55.680]   (laughing)
[00:33:55.680 --> 00:33:56.160]   - You didn't miss anything.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:33:56.640]   - You missed nothing.
[00:33:56.640 --> 00:33:58.000]   - I don't know what I missed.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:33:58.800]   - Nothing much happened.
[00:33:58.800 --> 00:34:01.280]   - But when Palmer and I woke up this morning,
[00:34:01.280 --> 00:34:02.560]   we're writing our speeches together
[00:34:02.560 --> 00:34:04.160]   and deciding what we were gonna say.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:06.320]   - Oh, do you have some feelings
[00:34:06.320 --> 00:34:07.520]   you'd like to share with the class?
[00:34:07.520 --> 00:34:08.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:09.360]   Seems to be a theme.
[00:34:09.360 --> 00:34:10.960]   I mean, this is turning into therapy.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:14.080]   - No, I don't have any enemies.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:14.880]   - No enemies.
[00:34:14.880 --> 00:34:15.040]   - It's sad.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.200]   - He gets to say nice things about people, J.K.
[00:34:17.200 --> 00:34:18.960]   - I got COVID, I couldn't think of a single person
[00:34:18.960 --> 00:34:19.920]   who do I wanna give this to.
[00:34:19.920 --> 00:34:21.120]   I was like, I like everybody.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:21.600]   I don't know.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.720]   (laughing)
[00:34:22.720 --> 00:34:24.160]   - So tell us.
[00:34:24.160 --> 00:34:25.520]   - He was gonna do a talk, right?
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:27.280]   Are you doing a talk for a couple of minutes?
[00:34:27.280 --> 00:34:28.160]   - We can talk from there.
[00:34:28.160 --> 00:34:29.360]   - Yeah, I'd love to share a little bit
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:30.400]   about what we're seeing.
[00:34:30.400 --> 00:34:32.000]   So first off, what Flexport is,
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:33.760]   is we're a global logistics platform.
[00:34:33.760 --> 00:34:36.240]   We help businesses of all sizes,
[00:34:36.240 --> 00:34:37.360]   ship products all over the world,
[00:34:37.360 --> 00:34:38.800]   from anywhere in the world to anywhere else in the world.
[00:34:38.800 --> 00:34:39.840]   We do a lot of business in China.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:43.040]   Probably about half of all of our volumes
[00:34:43.040 --> 00:34:43.760]   come out of China.
[00:34:43.760 --> 00:34:46.800]   - I know a landlord if you're looking for one, Ryan.
[00:34:46.800 --> 00:34:47.440]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.840]   - If you need some freight, you need to ship something,
[00:34:49.840 --> 00:34:51.200]   we'll do some business after this.
[00:34:51.200 --> 00:34:53.840]   And so we see a lot.
[00:34:53.840 --> 00:34:57.120]   We're sort of like a front row, backstage pass
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:34:58.880]   to the world economy of what's really happening
[00:34:58.880 --> 00:34:59.920]   and unfolding.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:02.320]   And it's been a crazy few years.
[00:35:02.320 --> 00:35:08.000]   To give you a context, so Flexport started in 2013.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:09.280]   First revenue was in 2014.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:11.280]   We did $2 million in revenue that year.
[00:35:11.280 --> 00:35:15.040]   We're on track this year to do $5 billion in revenue.
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:15.520]   (audience applauding)
[00:35:15.520 --> 00:35:18.880]   So from, very exhausting, yeah.
[00:35:18.880 --> 00:35:23.760]   And this time period is,
[00:35:23.760 --> 00:35:25.760]   I assume it's always like this in this industry.
[00:35:25.760 --> 00:35:26.800]   I have only been in the business
[00:35:26.800 --> 00:35:28.720]   for about eight or 10 years here.
[00:35:28.720 --> 00:35:31.200]   But just to take you through that timeline,
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.960]   in 2015, there was a port strike on the West Coast
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.720]   and you couldn't import anything into the United States
[00:35:36.720 --> 00:35:39.200]   for like three months, total pandemonium.
[00:35:39.200 --> 00:35:41.200]   By the way, that might happen again, July 1st,
[00:35:41.200 --> 00:35:43.360]   their contract that they negotiated back then
[00:35:43.360 --> 00:35:44.720]   is up for renewal on July 1st.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:45.600]   So we might talk about that.
[00:35:45.600 --> 00:35:50.560]   2016, there was so much excess capacity of ocean shipping.
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:52.480]   So many extra ships were purchased
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:54.480]   that the price of ocean freight hit the lowest
[00:35:54.480 --> 00:35:55.440]   in all of human history.
[00:35:55.440 --> 00:35:58.320]   It was like $600 to ship a container.
[00:35:58.320 --> 00:36:00.880]   This past year was 20,000 bucks, in 2016.
[00:36:00.880 --> 00:36:02.960]   So we go through these boom and bust cycles.
[00:36:02.960 --> 00:36:04.400]   It's an asset business that'll happen.
[00:36:04.400 --> 00:36:07.840]   2017, '18 and '19, our president would launch
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:10.080]   a new tariff war every couple of months
[00:36:10.080 --> 00:36:11.360]   and you couldn't predict anything.
[00:36:11.360 --> 00:36:14.000]   2020, a pandemic hits.
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:16.800]   You couldn't ship anything for a couple of months
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:18.880]   out of China where like, they were really hard,
[00:36:18.880 --> 00:36:20.480]   zero COVID, shut down factories,
[00:36:20.480 --> 00:36:22.000]   shut down all the purchase orders.
[00:36:22.000 --> 00:36:23.840]   Everyone thought the Great Depression was coming,
[00:36:23.840 --> 00:36:25.600]   canceled all the purchase orders.
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:27.360]   Then it turned out the opposite happened.
[00:36:27.360 --> 00:36:30.560]   It was this crazy boom and you couldn't import anything
[00:36:30.560 --> 00:36:32.640]   because the ports were overcrowded.
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:36.000]   It went from, in 2019, it took about 50 days
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:39.120]   to ship a container from like, when the goods are ready,
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:40.640]   when the factory raises their hand and says,
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.000]   "Hey, come and pick up these goods,"
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.040]   to right now it's about 120 days.
[00:36:45.040 --> 00:36:48.160]   So doubling, more than doubling the transit time.
[00:36:48.160 --> 00:36:52.480]   And it is just incredibly hard to operate
[00:36:52.480 --> 00:36:54.560]   in this environment if you're trying to run a business.
[00:36:54.560 --> 00:36:57.040]   And so we've had to learn how to navigate
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:58.720]   through chaos as Flexport.
[00:36:58.720 --> 00:37:00.880]   It's like, we kind of welcome it at this point.
[00:37:00.880 --> 00:37:04.320]   We found that it might actually be good for our business.
[00:37:04.320 --> 00:37:05.200]   We try not to talk about that
[00:37:05.200 --> 00:37:06.800]   because it's so bad for our customers
[00:37:06.800 --> 00:37:09.440]   and it's been hard to fulfill the customer promises.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:11.360]   But if you put yourself in the shoes of those customers,
[00:37:11.360 --> 00:37:14.160]   so like a direct-to-consumer e-commerce business,
[00:37:14.160 --> 00:37:15.920]   and we ship for probably 80 or 90%
[00:37:15.920 --> 00:37:19.760]   of the hot new D2C brands, a lot of IPOs recently,
[00:37:19.760 --> 00:37:22.080]   a lot of really cool, hot new brands,
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:27.040]   they're going through almost a perfect storm right now
[00:37:27.040 --> 00:37:30.160]   in like a really, really bad way,
[00:37:30.160 --> 00:37:31.440]   like the movie "The Perfect Storm,"
[00:37:31.440 --> 00:37:34.720]   because ocean freight rates are sky high.
[00:37:34.720 --> 00:37:38.000]   Mentioned there's 10, $20,000 to ship a container.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.640]   Rule of thumb, long-term is like two grand.
[00:37:40.640 --> 00:37:43.120]   So really, really elevated costs.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:46.080]   Walmart announced really high costs this morning.
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:47.440]   And so it's not just small companies,
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:49.120]   but Walmart announced their costs
[00:37:49.120 --> 00:37:50.480]   were through the roof from supply chain
[00:37:50.480 --> 00:37:51.920]   and their stock fell 10% today,
[00:37:51.920 --> 00:37:54.640]   wiping off $40 billion of market cap this morning.
[00:37:54.640 --> 00:37:58.160]   So it hits companies of all sizes.
[00:37:58.160 --> 00:38:00.640]   But these D2C brands got a double whammy
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.880]   because Apple last, I think it was last year,
[00:38:02.880 --> 00:38:04.240]   when they changed their privacy rules
[00:38:04.240 --> 00:38:06.480]   and their customer acquisition models
[00:38:06.480 --> 00:38:10.560]   on Instagram, Facebook, all these things stopped working.
[00:38:10.560 --> 00:38:13.760]   And so at the same moment you're cacked, it stops working.
[00:38:13.760 --> 00:38:15.040]   You can't acquire customers.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.720]   Your supply chain costs are through the roof.
[00:38:16.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   And then add to that,
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.160]   that consumers are now starting to come back
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:21.280]   to conferences like this,
[00:38:21.280 --> 00:38:23.600]   go back to the restaurants and the clubs
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:24.400]   and doing the travel.
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.920]   And during the pandemic, everybody just bought stuff.
[00:38:27.920 --> 00:38:30.720]   You got to get your dopamine from somewhere
[00:38:30.720 --> 00:38:32.960]   and everybody was just buying goods.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:37.600]   So that is like a triple whammy for these companies.
[00:38:37.600 --> 00:38:40.800]   I'm incredibly worried about the whole D2C brand,
[00:38:40.800 --> 00:38:41.760]   the whole D2C space.
[00:38:41.760 --> 00:38:44.080]   The D2C space, just anyone in physical goods.
[00:38:44.080 --> 00:38:46.320]   - You saw it in like the, I think it was Thrashio
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:49.200]   that just announced they're laying off 25% of their-
[00:38:49.200 --> 00:38:52.720]   - Thrashio was buying a collection of those Amazon D2C brands,
[00:38:52.720 --> 00:38:56.000]   putting them together and trying to have some economies of scale.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:59.760]   But when your supply and your demand both get 10Xed
[00:38:59.760 --> 00:39:02.480]   in the wrong direction, it's game over.
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:03.680]   - I don't know if it's game over,
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:05.360]   but it definitely changes the rules of the game.
[00:39:05.360 --> 00:39:07.520]   The reality is, look, people are still gonna buy stuff.
[00:39:07.520 --> 00:39:08.560]   There are gonna be successful.
[00:39:08.560 --> 00:39:09.360]   There are gonna be some winners.
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.480]   There are gonna be brands that survive.
[00:39:10.480 --> 00:39:10.960]   - At what price though?
[00:39:10.960 --> 00:39:11.680]   At what price?
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.120]   - Well, so you're saying that your thesis that you're making,
[00:39:15.120 --> 00:39:17.600]   the statement that you're making today is,
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:21.600]   hey, we're seeing real significant risk to D2C companies
[00:39:21.600 --> 00:39:23.440]   because of this confluence of issues right now.
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:26.160]   And this could be a big threat to a lot of businesses,
[00:39:26.160 --> 00:39:28.480]   particularly in an environment where venture funding is-
[00:39:28.480 --> 00:39:30.000]   - I think again, venture funding-
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:31.200]   - Oh my gosh, it's a triple storm.
[00:39:31.200 --> 00:39:32.080]   - Capital markets are-
[00:39:32.080 --> 00:39:34.160]   - Capital markets, public and private.
[00:39:34.160 --> 00:39:35.680]   - Investors are like, "Oh, we'll look at this and go,
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.760]   "Hey, maybe I put more into SaaS or something."
[00:39:37.760 --> 00:39:39.760]   - But Keith said it's just easier to not do anything.
[00:39:39.760 --> 00:39:41.040]   - It might be easier to not do anything.
[00:39:41.040 --> 00:39:42.560]   So what does that mean?
[00:39:42.560 --> 00:39:43.520]   How do you manage this?
[00:39:43.520 --> 00:39:46.240]   And fundamentally, one of the problems
[00:39:46.240 --> 00:39:49.600]   that comes about in all supply chains,
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:51.680]   it's been written about the famous PhD paper
[00:39:51.680 --> 00:39:54.720]   from like the '60s or something called the bullwhip effect.
[00:39:54.720 --> 00:39:57.600]   And a bullwhip, if you crack a whip,
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:39:59.680]   the end of that whip is moving incredibly fast.
[00:39:59.680 --> 00:40:03.280]   And it's a bit like that in supply chains
[00:40:03.280 --> 00:40:05.840]   because you have imperfect information.
[00:40:05.840 --> 00:40:08.080]   And so the people doing demand planning
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.160]   are living in one system, they're selling goods,
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:11.920]   they're looking at this data set.
[00:40:11.920 --> 00:40:15.040]   The people producing stuff, it's on a different system.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:17.440]   How long is it taking to produce things?
[00:40:17.440 --> 00:40:18.400]   That's getting longer.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:19.840]   The transit time is getting longer.
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:22.720]   This data is living across all these different domains
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:25.840]   and becoming very, very hard for a brand to make a decision.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:26.960]   How many goods should we buy?
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:28.560]   When should we buy them?
[00:40:28.560 --> 00:40:29.200]   - So we're on what?
[00:40:29.200 --> 00:40:30.240]   - How much do we wanna have in stock?
[00:40:30.240 --> 00:40:31.920]   How do we avoid being way overstock?
[00:40:31.920 --> 00:40:34.240]   And then what we're seeing right now
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:37.120]   is these warehouses are overflowing and people can't--
[00:40:37.120 --> 00:40:38.240]   - So what changes that?
[00:40:38.240 --> 00:40:39.440]   Like what breaks it open?
[00:40:39.440 --> 00:40:43.360]   So like in China, Pinduoduo didn't exist in 2015.
[00:40:43.360 --> 00:40:46.640]   Now 800 million plus users,
[00:40:46.640 --> 00:40:49.120]   but it was technology that broke it open.
[00:40:49.120 --> 00:40:50.240]   Like what's the breakout moment
[00:40:50.240 --> 00:40:51.600]   to solve this exact problem you're talking about?
[00:40:51.600 --> 00:40:52.800]   - Yeah, I mean, actually China's got,
[00:40:52.800 --> 00:40:57.840]   one of the companies to watch is Shein, S-H-E-I-N.
[00:40:57.840 --> 00:41:00.080]   It's this Chinese, kind of like the new Zara
[00:41:00.080 --> 00:41:02.400]   that is taking over the world.
[00:41:02.400 --> 00:41:04.800]   I think they're gonna do $20 billion in revenue this year.
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:05.840]   - Fast fashion?
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:06.560]   - Fast fashion.
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:08.480]   They're launching a thousand SKUs a day.
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:12.000]   A thousand new SKUs a day, all like AI generated.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:14.240]   And then if people ordering up, they produce it.
[00:41:14.240 --> 00:41:16.320]   And it's like a really incredible--
[00:41:16.320 --> 00:41:19.520]   - Wait, you're saying a robot says, "Make these SKUs."
[00:41:19.520 --> 00:41:23.040]   - This is where this shirt is from, actually.
[00:41:23.040 --> 00:41:24.480]   - No way, your shirt is from--
[00:41:24.480 --> 00:41:24.960]   - I kid you not.
[00:41:24.960 --> 00:41:25.680]   - Yeah, see?
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.240]   - You like that?
[00:41:26.240 --> 00:41:27.200]   - Yeah, I did that shirt.
[00:41:27.200 --> 00:41:28.240]   (audience applauding)
[00:41:28.240 --> 00:41:29.440]   - But I kid you not.
[00:41:29.440 --> 00:41:30.560]   - It's gonna be a million of them
[00:41:30.560 --> 00:41:31.440]   that are gonna be ordered after this.
[00:41:31.440 --> 00:41:31.920]   - Hold on, sorry, sorry.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.960]   Tell us, so wait, sorry.
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:34.160]   This shirt you bought--
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:37.840]   - So it's literally a shirt from Shein, but yes.
[00:41:37.840 --> 00:41:40.720]   So if Zara is seeing something on a runway,
[00:41:41.520 --> 00:41:43.440]   determining that that trend will hit,
[00:41:43.440 --> 00:41:44.720]   and then they can have it in stores,
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:46.400]   I think within like eight or nine days,
[00:41:46.400 --> 00:41:47.600]   something pretty wild,
[00:41:47.600 --> 00:41:52.160]   Shein's about as close to instantaneous as you can get.
[00:41:52.160 --> 00:41:55.360]   So very fast moving SKUs, it's sort of hyper speed fashion.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:56.800]   - Yeah, but they're kind of like pre-conference.
[00:41:56.800 --> 00:41:57.520]   - Almost on the same day.
[00:41:57.520 --> 00:42:00.400]   - Like for minority, but they're predicting
[00:42:00.400 --> 00:42:03.280]   that this puffy shirt is going to be like,
[00:42:03.280 --> 00:42:04.640]   "Women are gonna wanna go for pirate ship."
[00:42:04.640 --> 00:42:05.920]   - But it's a fly shirt.
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:07.760]   - It's fly as fuck, I agree.
[00:42:07.760 --> 00:42:08.240]   (audience applauding)
[00:42:08.320 --> 00:42:12.080]   And I think one of the key things here is the transit time
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:14.000]   of how long does it take you from when the thing is made
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:15.280]   to when it gets to the customer?
[00:42:15.280 --> 00:42:17.600]   Because if it stretches out the way it has right now
[00:42:17.600 --> 00:42:19.680]   in ocean freight market, where it's taking forever,
[00:42:19.680 --> 00:42:21.600]   if that takes three months, four months, five months--
[00:42:21.600 --> 00:42:22.880]   - Might not be flying no more.
[00:42:22.880 --> 00:42:24.720]   - Six months, all of a sudden you've placed these orders
[00:42:24.720 --> 00:42:26.160]   and then the demand went away
[00:42:26.160 --> 00:42:27.520]   'cause people started going to nightclubs
[00:42:27.520 --> 00:42:29.200]   instead of buying their gardening equipment.
[00:42:29.200 --> 00:42:31.920]   And so the tighter you can make that,
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.960]   and it does speak to spending a little bit more on logistics
[00:42:34.960 --> 00:42:39.040]   where traditional procurement person in logistics
[00:42:39.040 --> 00:42:39.840]   only thinks about like,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.720]   "I'm just gonna buy the cheapest freight I can ever buy."
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:45.760]   Because they don't understand that your goods in transit
[00:42:45.760 --> 00:42:48.160]   are just money that's taken a different form
[00:42:48.160 --> 00:42:48.960]   for a period of time.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:52.000]   And money has a cost to it.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:53.360]   And if you're sitting there on six months,
[00:42:53.360 --> 00:42:54.240]   that's already expensive
[00:42:54.240 --> 00:42:55.920]   because you gotta pay interest on that.
[00:42:55.920 --> 00:42:56.800]   There's opportunity costs.
[00:42:56.800 --> 00:42:58.080]   What else could you do with the money?
[00:42:58.080 --> 00:42:59.600]   But now that cost has gotten much worse
[00:42:59.600 --> 00:43:00.960]   because by the time the goods arrive,
[00:43:00.960 --> 00:43:02.480]   maybe nobody wants them.
[00:43:02.480 --> 00:43:05.920]   You saw that with Christmas where you import Christmas,
[00:43:05.920 --> 00:43:07.600]   that's the classic thing, you import Christmas stuff
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.120]   and in January it's worthless.
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:13.280]   - At what price do people just find alternate ways,
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.240]   whether it's you establish domestic 3D printing
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:18.880]   or you buy a fleet of planes or like,
[00:43:18.880 --> 00:43:19.760]   there's gotta be a work.
[00:43:19.760 --> 00:43:20.720]   'Cause like I saw this image,
[00:43:20.720 --> 00:43:22.320]   I think maybe you tweeted it,
[00:43:22.320 --> 00:43:24.880]   of this entire massive traffic jam,
[00:43:24.880 --> 00:43:28.160]   basically trying to get the ships even into China
[00:43:28.160 --> 00:43:30.480]   because the COVID-19 lockdowns are so strict,
[00:43:30.480 --> 00:43:32.240]   but that's also exacerbated all of this.
[00:43:32.240 --> 00:43:34.080]   - And last year Walmart,
[00:43:34.080 --> 00:43:35.920]   didn't they announce they're spending $10 billion
[00:43:35.920 --> 00:43:37.440]   verticalizing their supply chain
[00:43:37.440 --> 00:43:40.400]   and building out their own infrastructure for moving goods?
[00:43:40.400 --> 00:43:42.400]   - You're seeing a lot of companies do this,
[00:43:42.400 --> 00:43:44.160]   much easier said than done.
[00:43:44.160 --> 00:43:48.000]   You've seen at least a few of the big box retailers,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:49.680]   Walmart, I wanna say Home Depot, Costco,
[00:43:49.680 --> 00:43:50.720]   a number of these guys have said,
[00:43:50.720 --> 00:43:51.520]   "Hey, we're gonna charter our own ships."
[00:43:51.520 --> 00:43:52.400]   - Target was the other one.
[00:43:52.400 --> 00:43:55.200]   - Maybe Target, Amazon of course,
[00:43:55.200 --> 00:43:56.320]   go charter their own ships,
[00:43:56.320 --> 00:43:57.600]   go solve the problem their own way.
[00:43:57.600 --> 00:43:59.280]   It's really hard to do,
[00:43:59.280 --> 00:44:00.720]   run these things at scale and operate it.
[00:44:00.720 --> 00:44:02.160]   It looks good at the PowerPoint slide.
[00:44:02.160 --> 00:44:05.760]   When you have to get down to it, it's really hard.
[00:44:05.760 --> 00:44:07.520]   - So is there a big CapEx play here, Ryan,
[00:44:07.520 --> 00:44:08.320]   for the next decade?
[00:44:08.320 --> 00:44:09.280]   - I think-
[00:44:09.280 --> 00:44:12.640]   - Like a big capital equipment, hard asset play.
[00:44:12.640 --> 00:44:17.360]   - So the world's ocean carriers,
[00:44:17.360 --> 00:44:18.720]   that's what we call the people that own the ships,
[00:44:18.720 --> 00:44:22.400]   have actually ordered 25% more ships,
[00:44:22.400 --> 00:44:24.880]   increased the fleet by 25% over the next three years.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:26.160]   - Wow.
[00:44:26.160 --> 00:44:28.400]   - So it could be ugly the other way real quick.
[00:44:28.400 --> 00:44:29.840]   You have too many ships and nobody,
[00:44:29.840 --> 00:44:30.800]   the ship owner can't make any money.
[00:44:30.800 --> 00:44:31.440]   - Same is happening in mining.
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:33.840]   I mean, it's a similar sort of, but anyway.
[00:44:33.840 --> 00:44:34.960]   - Ryan said it best.
[00:44:34.960 --> 00:44:37.760]   The problem is you can't forecast demand accurately
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:39.600]   for these long lead time categories
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:40.960]   that are highly CapEx intensive.
[00:44:40.960 --> 00:44:41.200]   - Totally.
[00:44:41.200 --> 00:44:43.280]   - Whether it's mining or whether it's chipping.
[00:44:43.280 --> 00:44:46.000]   How do you make a $500 million CapEx decision
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.160]   for a business demand cycle
[00:44:48.160 --> 00:44:49.120]   that's five years into the future?
[00:44:49.120 --> 00:44:50.960]   - But they're all taking profit hits
[00:44:50.960 --> 00:44:52.560]   and saying we have to make this investment
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.800]   because we need the security, we need the redundancy.
[00:44:54.800 --> 00:44:56.080]   I mean, Walmart did it, right?
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:57.920]   They were optimized to a T.
[00:44:57.920 --> 00:44:58.560]   - Well, so the way-
[00:44:58.560 --> 00:44:59.440]   - And then all of a sudden it's like,
[00:44:59.440 --> 00:45:00.800]   hey, that optimized system doesn't work.
[00:45:00.800 --> 00:45:02.720]   - Look, the way that mining, for example,
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:04.080]   deals with this, which is really interesting,
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:05.920]   is they get these companies to sign up
[00:45:05.920 --> 00:45:08.080]   what's called take or pay agreements, right?
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:11.040]   And so they can actually smooth out the demand curve
[00:45:11.040 --> 00:45:11.840]   five or six in the future.
[00:45:11.840 --> 00:45:12.560]   - Yeah, can't do that to the consumer.
[00:45:12.560 --> 00:45:14.960]   - Take or pay means I'll do a deal that says,
[00:45:14.960 --> 00:45:17.120]   okay, I'm gonna rip the lithium out of the ground.
[00:45:17.120 --> 00:45:19.360]   You take it or you pay for it.
[00:45:19.360 --> 00:45:20.720]   I don't care what you do,
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:23.280]   but I'm gonna get the revenue assurance I need
[00:45:23.280 --> 00:45:24.720]   to go to Wall Street to get the money.
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:26.080]   - And we've started to see those signs for the first time.
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:27.520]   So we've signed three-year contracts.
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:28.400]   Flexport was the first ever
[00:45:28.400 --> 00:45:30.320]   to sign a multi-year contract where we commit,
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.920]   we will pay for this freight whether or not we ship anything.
[00:45:33.920 --> 00:45:34.400]   - Take or pay.
[00:45:34.400 --> 00:45:35.200]   - We're gonna pay up front.
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.080]   Yeah, okay, take or pay.
[00:45:36.080 --> 00:45:39.120]   And you asked a little bit,
[00:45:39.120 --> 00:45:40.080]   air freight, what's gonna happen there?
[00:45:40.080 --> 00:45:42.800]   Well, remember, 50% of all the world's air freight
[00:45:42.800 --> 00:45:44.640]   flies in the belly of passenger planes.
[00:45:44.640 --> 00:45:46.960]   And there's way less people traveling to and from Asia
[00:45:46.960 --> 00:45:47.440]   than there were.
[00:45:47.440 --> 00:45:48.000]   - Is that right?
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:49.280]   - Yeah, 50% of the world's air freight,
[00:45:49.280 --> 00:45:50.560]   which is a little scary when you think about
[00:45:50.560 --> 00:45:52.400]   like what's under the belly of that.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:53.760]   - Yeah, is that getting scanned?
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:54.960]   - It is, it is.
[00:45:54.960 --> 00:45:56.960]   There's good controls on that, but you never know.
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:45:57.360]   It's always-
[00:45:57.360 --> 00:45:58.960]   - Yeah, it's always a little nerve wracking.
[00:45:58.960 --> 00:46:00.160]   - Getting scanned.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:01.120]   - So, and in fact-
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:02.320]   - He seemed to be not so sure.
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:05.360]   - You know, you work in any industry long enough,
[00:46:05.360 --> 00:46:07.520]   you start to question whether everything's perfect.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:11.360]   So we've actually got 10 passenger planes
[00:46:11.360 --> 00:46:13.600]   that we've leased and we'll keep doing more
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:15.040]   that are not flying any passengers.
[00:46:15.040 --> 00:46:17.120]   We're just filling them with freight.
[00:46:17.120 --> 00:46:18.320]   We started doing this in the pandemic.
[00:46:18.320 --> 00:46:19.440]   - Are there seats in them?
[00:46:19.440 --> 00:46:20.160]   - Flying masks.
[00:46:20.160 --> 00:46:21.280]   - Are there seats at the top?
[00:46:21.280 --> 00:46:22.480]   - There's still seats in some of them.
[00:46:22.480 --> 00:46:23.520]   Some we've ripped out the seats.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:24.560]   - It's like castaway.
[00:46:24.560 --> 00:46:26.480]   You know, you got the big plane.
[00:46:26.480 --> 00:46:27.360]   - Yeah, yeah.
[00:46:27.360 --> 00:46:28.080]   - Basically just holding stuff.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:31.520]   - If you want to go to Asia, I've got a 787.
[00:46:31.520 --> 00:46:32.400]   There's nobody on there.
[00:46:32.400 --> 00:46:33.920]   It could be a private flight, just you.
[00:46:33.920 --> 00:46:36.400]   - But exactly, this is why you've seen the rise
[00:46:36.400 --> 00:46:38.000]   of logistics real estate
[00:46:38.000 --> 00:46:40.720]   as a deeply institutional asset class
[00:46:40.720 --> 00:46:43.040]   because that math that you talk about,
[00:46:43.040 --> 00:46:45.120]   the algorithms of determining what is ordered,
[00:46:45.120 --> 00:46:47.680]   how long will it sit and how fast do people want it?
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:50.000]   That takes infrastructure on land
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:51.200]   to be able to get it to people as well.
[00:46:51.200 --> 00:46:52.720]   - And coming back to the question about assets,
[00:46:52.720 --> 00:46:53.840]   is there a play here?
[00:46:53.840 --> 00:46:56.080]   Probably yes, because most of Wall Street
[00:46:56.080 --> 00:46:56.640]   has been trained.
[00:46:56.640 --> 00:46:58.320]   They've gone to all the same business schools
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:46:59.200]   and everybody's been trained
[00:46:59.200 --> 00:47:00.480]   that assets are terrible.
[00:47:00.480 --> 00:47:01.440]   Get them off your books.
[00:47:01.440 --> 00:47:02.160]   Don't carry them.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:04.640]   - This is what happened with oil and gas
[00:47:04.640 --> 00:47:06.080]   going into last year.
[00:47:06.080 --> 00:47:07.440]   - Asset light work.
[00:47:07.440 --> 00:47:08.160]   - And everyone missed it.
[00:47:08.160 --> 00:47:09.200]   - You want to be asset light.
[00:47:09.200 --> 00:47:11.120]   - It's still the trend and almost everywhere
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.600]   until somebody like TSMC comes along and says,
[00:47:13.600 --> 00:47:14.720]   you know what, you don't want assets?
[00:47:14.720 --> 00:47:16.560]   Intel, like fine, we'll build the fabs.
[00:47:16.560 --> 00:47:18.000]   And now they're a $400 billion company
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:20.240]   'cause they're willing to have assets on the books.
[00:47:20.240 --> 00:47:21.520]   But it's a different investor.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.200]   - And now they have the power and the equation
[00:47:23.200 --> 00:47:25.840]   and they can get a better share of value.
[00:47:25.840 --> 00:47:26.400]   - Right.
[00:47:26.400 --> 00:47:28.000]   - And I've been answering this question--
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:28.800]   - Blockade around Wall Street.
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:29.840]   - That's the real estate business.
[00:47:29.840 --> 00:47:31.200]   The hardest question for me to answer,
[00:47:31.200 --> 00:47:32.960]   and I know that there's some entrepreneurs
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:34.000]   out there who have the same question.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:35.440]   Anytime someone asks me,
[00:47:35.440 --> 00:47:38.000]   is Flexport a software company or a logistics company?
[00:47:38.000 --> 00:47:40.800]   Are you going to own assets or not own assets?
[00:47:40.800 --> 00:47:41.280]   - Yes.
[00:47:41.280 --> 00:47:43.680]   - And I think the correct answer
[00:47:43.680 --> 00:47:45.040]   is to ask the investor which one
[00:47:45.040 --> 00:47:46.320]   they'll give you a higher multiple for
[00:47:46.320 --> 00:47:47.120]   and then just say that.
[00:47:47.120 --> 00:47:49.120]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:49.120 --> 00:47:50.560]   Try to figure out who you're talking to.
[00:47:50.560 --> 00:47:51.920]   But it is on some level,
[00:47:51.920 --> 00:47:55.760]   maybe another answer is like kind of Buddhist dualism
[00:47:55.760 --> 00:47:57.520]   like you can't do logistics without the tech,
[00:47:57.520 --> 00:47:58.720]   you can't do the tech without the logistics.
[00:47:58.720 --> 00:48:00.560]   - I think you're bringing up something which is that today
[00:48:00.560 --> 00:48:02.000]   the problem with the capital markets
[00:48:02.000 --> 00:48:04.320]   is actually that it is very balkanized.
[00:48:04.320 --> 00:48:07.280]   So meaning, let's just say you take a company public
[00:48:07.280 --> 00:48:09.680]   like yours, the problem that you'll have
[00:48:09.680 --> 00:48:11.920]   in the public markets is that there are folks
[00:48:11.920 --> 00:48:13.520]   that you'll go to in that room
[00:48:13.520 --> 00:48:15.200]   that understand SaaS software,
[00:48:15.200 --> 00:48:18.320]   understand margin structure of a software business, et cetera.
[00:48:18.320 --> 00:48:19.440]   And then there's folks over here
[00:48:19.440 --> 00:48:21.040]   who run the industrials business
[00:48:21.040 --> 00:48:23.040]   and folks over here who run consumer.
[00:48:23.040 --> 00:48:25.280]   The problem is those three folks don't talk.
[00:48:25.280 --> 00:48:27.680]   They have three completely different conceptions
[00:48:27.680 --> 00:48:29.040]   of what a good business is.
[00:48:29.040 --> 00:48:31.360]   And the problem for you will be,
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:33.120]   and I'm not forecasting this for you to be a problem.
[00:48:33.120 --> 00:48:33.840]   - You're correct.
[00:48:33.840 --> 00:48:36.480]   - Is that you can get orphaned in any one of these groups
[00:48:36.480 --> 00:48:38.000]   and now all of a sudden the capital markets
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:39.680]   could be totally shut for you.
[00:48:39.680 --> 00:48:41.760]   This is a very important point that you're bringing up.
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:43.920]   The thing that I think we need to change
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.040]   is like the capital people that control the money flows
[00:48:47.040 --> 00:48:49.040]   do need to have a little bit more of an open mind.
[00:48:49.040 --> 00:48:52.240]   Sure, it's true that you'd love a 90% gross margin business
[00:48:52.240 --> 00:48:54.880]   but it is also true in the TSMC case,
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:48:57.440]   you'd rather have a business doing 20% on $500 billion.
[00:48:57.440 --> 00:49:00.640]   - Well, and if we look, Chamath,
[00:49:00.640 --> 00:49:03.920]   we also have some examples of Amazon.
[00:49:03.920 --> 00:49:06.960]   The market seems to have worked out this business
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.880]   that's very factory and asset heavy
[00:49:08.880 --> 00:49:12.240]   in delivering goods to us and the cloud business.
[00:49:12.240 --> 00:49:14.960]   - Even Amazon, like look, Amazon got escape velocity
[00:49:14.960 --> 00:49:17.760]   on less than a billion dollars of invested capital.
[00:49:17.760 --> 00:49:20.640]   The problem is if Ryan, for example, decides,
[00:49:20.640 --> 00:49:22.560]   hey, I'm gonna go on actually vertically integrate
[00:49:22.560 --> 00:49:24.480]   and buy an entire fleet of ships.
[00:49:24.480 --> 00:49:28.000]   That's probably a 10 to $20 billion cap back cycle
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.040]   over 10 years and you think about replacement costs.
[00:49:31.040 --> 00:49:32.960]   It may make a ton of sense actually.
[00:49:32.960 --> 00:49:35.920]   - Right, I wonder when Amazon's cap expenses
[00:49:35.920 --> 00:49:37.360]   for those servers started to hit.
[00:49:37.360 --> 00:49:38.400]   (audience laughing)
[00:49:38.400 --> 00:49:39.280]   - He's thinking about it.
[00:49:39.280 --> 00:49:40.960]   - I'm gonna buy a fleet of ships.
[00:49:40.960 --> 00:49:42.080]   - But do you think the capital markets will show up?
[00:49:42.080 --> 00:49:43.760]   - The little boy in me definitely wants to do that.
[00:49:43.760 --> 00:49:46.240]   - You wanna own a fleet of ships?
[00:49:46.240 --> 00:49:46.960]   - You already own a bunch of these planes.
[00:49:46.960 --> 00:49:48.160]   - Who doesn't wanna own a fleet of ships?
[00:49:48.160 --> 00:49:49.120]   But no, we're not gonna do that.
[00:49:49.120 --> 00:49:51.280]   I don't think, you know, there's two plays.
[00:49:51.280 --> 00:49:53.520]   Fundamentally, your bullwhip effect means
[00:49:53.520 --> 00:49:56.160]   the data can't flow and people can't make decisions
[00:49:56.160 --> 00:49:58.400]   optimally because the data's trapped in multiple places.
[00:49:58.400 --> 00:50:01.440]   You don't know how to run an efficient supply chain
[00:50:01.440 --> 00:50:03.440]   because you don't know how many trucks do I need
[00:50:03.440 --> 00:50:04.960]   when the ship arrives.
[00:50:04.960 --> 00:50:07.200]   Like actually, even not even like long-term demand
[00:50:07.200 --> 00:50:08.320]   for forecasting how many ships,
[00:50:08.320 --> 00:50:10.560]   but like literally that ship is gonna arrive.
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:11.760]   How many trucks should I dispatch?
[00:50:11.760 --> 00:50:13.040]   When should I dispatch them?
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:14.640]   Like there's two ways to solve this problem.
[00:50:14.640 --> 00:50:17.600]   One is to own the asset and the other is to create
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:20.000]   a data network effect such that the asset owner
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:22.320]   benefits enough from putting it on your platform,
[00:50:22.320 --> 00:50:24.880]   your machine learning, your algorithms are helping them
[00:50:24.880 --> 00:50:26.640]   make more money from their asset.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:28.080]   They wanna tell you what's going on.
[00:50:28.080 --> 00:50:30.560]   - Or you can invest further down into the chain.
[00:50:30.560 --> 00:50:32.880]   - One of them's a lot, hopefully, simpler
[00:50:32.880 --> 00:50:34.480]   and don't need to manage as many people
[00:50:34.480 --> 00:50:36.080]   and life is easier if you can solve
[00:50:36.080 --> 00:50:37.360]   the data machine learning problem.
[00:50:37.360 --> 00:50:37.520]   Sorry.
[00:50:37.520 --> 00:50:39.440]   - Well, you look to Alibaba and Alibaba investing
[00:50:39.440 --> 00:50:40.720]   down into China.
[00:50:40.720 --> 00:50:44.080]   Like there is a middle road of being able to go to China.
[00:50:44.080 --> 00:50:46.400]   So logistics, warehouse, right?
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:47.520]   For them to push goods out to the market.
[00:50:47.520 --> 00:50:51.760]   - As stupid as it sounds, you having purchased
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:54.080]   a shipping company and putting it over here,
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:50:55.520]   to your point, Claire, and saying,
[00:50:55.520 --> 00:50:56.800]   here's the little thing we bought.
[00:50:56.800 --> 00:50:57.600]   It's a bunch of ships.
[00:50:57.600 --> 00:50:58.640]   It's its own balance sheet.
[00:50:58.640 --> 00:51:00.080]   And then here's the really great business.
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.080]   But we have this little subsidiary over here
[00:51:02.080 --> 00:51:03.520]   is a potential middle ground.
[00:51:03.520 --> 00:51:05.040]   - It's what makes Flexport fun business.
[00:51:05.040 --> 00:51:07.520]   There's like a million strategies and ways to play out.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:10.000]   And I'm not a big believer in like predicting the future.
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:12.320]   And you wanna have a vision and know where you're going,
[00:51:12.320 --> 00:51:15.120]   but I think be sort of flexible in that.
[00:51:15.120 --> 00:51:16.000]   - What's in the name?
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:17.600]   - We talk about our culture a lot.
[00:51:17.600 --> 00:51:20.800]   What's the goal of a company's culture?
[00:51:21.200 --> 00:51:23.760]   And Elon talks about the goal of a company.
[00:51:23.760 --> 00:51:25.520]   The purpose is like, hey, we've got to create
[00:51:25.520 --> 00:51:28.880]   valuable products and services for fellow humans, right?
[00:51:28.880 --> 00:51:30.880]   But the goal of your culture is how do you maximize
[00:51:30.880 --> 00:51:32.800]   your velocity in that direction?
[00:51:32.800 --> 00:51:34.480]   And velocity is a really important word
[00:51:34.480 --> 00:51:37.280]   because we forget a lot, like normal people forget
[00:51:37.280 --> 00:51:38.880]   that velocity is different from speed.
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:41.680]   If you remember your physics, velocity has a direction.
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.200]   You gotta know where you're going.
[00:51:43.200 --> 00:51:44.960]   And sometimes going really, really fast
[00:51:44.960 --> 00:51:46.160]   is actually negative velocity
[00:51:46.160 --> 00:51:47.040]   'cause you're going the wrong way.
[00:51:47.040 --> 00:51:48.240]   And so how do you stay agile?
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:50.240]   The world's gonna throw all kinds of chaos at you,
[00:51:50.240 --> 00:51:51.680]   be nimble, be able to change.
[00:51:51.680 --> 00:51:53.760]   We don't know exactly the strategy.
[00:51:53.760 --> 00:51:54.560]   I don't have everything mapped out.
[00:51:54.560 --> 00:51:57.360]   - As we wrap here, question for both you and Claire,
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:52:00.560]   which is China has big--
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:02.240]   - Before you do your wrap question,
[00:52:02.240 --> 00:52:03.840]   can I just, can I ask him to,
[00:52:03.840 --> 00:52:05.360]   can you tell us, the audience,
[00:52:05.360 --> 00:52:07.200]   about what you did during the UK crisis?
[00:52:07.200 --> 00:52:08.800]   - Oh, this is beautiful.
[00:52:08.800 --> 00:52:11.120]   - It's just like 30 seconds about, you know.
[00:52:11.120 --> 00:52:14.720]   - I didn't go there like Antonio, the crazy man, but what?
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:16.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:52:16.000 --> 00:52:18.720]   So we started this group in 2017 called Flexport.org
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:20.720]   to do humanitarian relief shipping.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:23.840]   Really at that time, the crisis was Syria
[00:52:23.840 --> 00:52:25.760]   and trying to help refugees.
[00:52:25.760 --> 00:52:26.800]   It was really a simple idea.
[00:52:26.800 --> 00:52:28.160]   It's like, look, we got all this stuff here.
[00:52:28.160 --> 00:52:29.760]   We know they need stuff at the refugee camps.
[00:52:29.760 --> 00:52:31.360]   What if we shipped it there?
[00:52:31.360 --> 00:52:34.000]   Seemed like a radical idea.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:35.680]   We maintain a database of partners.
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:38.400]   So we have agents that can operate on behalf of Flexport
[00:52:38.400 --> 00:52:40.000]   in over 120 countries.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:42.960]   And at that time, I simply emailed our Syria partner
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:44.400]   who was literally based in Aleppo
[00:52:44.400 --> 00:52:45.920]   where a lot of this destruction was happening.
[00:52:45.920 --> 00:52:47.680]   And I emailed, I said, hey, we'd like to ship a container
[00:52:47.680 --> 00:52:49.520]   to this refugee camp down there.
[00:52:49.520 --> 00:52:50.720]   And he was like, sure, what's the address?
[00:52:50.720 --> 00:52:51.440]   Where do you want to ship it?
[00:52:51.440 --> 00:52:52.960]   And I was like, wait, is that easy?
[00:52:52.960 --> 00:52:54.240]   Like, I thought this was like,
[00:52:54.240 --> 00:52:55.280]   and I realized you could do that.
[00:52:55.280 --> 00:52:56.160]   No, we didn't ship into Syria
[00:52:56.160 --> 00:52:57.360]   'cause we didn't know who was gonna end up in.
[00:52:57.360 --> 00:52:59.920]   So we shipped to refugee camps in Turkey and Jordan.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:02.000]   So we've been doing this now for five years,
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:03.840]   shipping to over 50 different countries,
[00:53:03.840 --> 00:53:07.760]   any kind of, anytime there's a hurricane, earthquakes,
[00:53:07.760 --> 00:53:09.200]   but we're a warp.
[00:53:09.200 --> 00:53:12.320]   And so when we saw this happening in Ukraine,
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:13.920]   we immediately kicked into high gear.
[00:53:13.920 --> 00:53:16.640]   The Flexport.org team has about 12 full-time people.
[00:53:16.640 --> 00:53:18.640]   And then we have a model where employees at Flexport
[00:53:18.640 --> 00:53:19.360]   can surge onto that.
[00:53:19.360 --> 00:53:21.760]   So we've had about 60 people working on this.
[00:53:21.760 --> 00:53:24.960]   In this case, usually we offer pro bono shipping
[00:53:24.960 --> 00:53:26.640]   'cause shipping is expensive.
[00:53:26.640 --> 00:53:28.480]   We can't just eat the full cost.
[00:53:28.480 --> 00:53:30.880]   We are profitable, but not enough to really solve
[00:53:30.880 --> 00:53:32.320]   the world's problems all by ourself.
[00:53:32.320 --> 00:53:35.760]   So we created a GoFundMe campaign,
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:37.920]   partnered with Ashton Kutcher and Mila Kunis.
[00:53:37.920 --> 00:53:39.600]   Ashton's an early investor in Flexport.
[00:53:39.600 --> 00:53:43.760]   And we raised 25 million bucks to pay for shipping
[00:53:43.760 --> 00:53:45.520]   to deliver goods.
[00:53:45.520 --> 00:53:46.080]   (audience applauding)
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:46.960]   Yeah, thank you.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.000]   - Well, and the way you did it was--
[00:53:48.000 --> 00:53:49.920]   - And thank you to Ashton and all of our investors,
[00:53:49.920 --> 00:53:51.040]   a lot of great people stepped up.
[00:53:51.040 --> 00:53:52.960]   - You emailed the besties and said,
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.760]   "Hey, it's $4,400 a container."
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:57.840]   Was that the number, 42 or 44?
[00:53:57.840 --> 00:53:58.720]   - It depends on where it's coming from.
[00:53:58.720 --> 00:53:59.840]   - For Ukraine specifically.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:02.400]   - I mean, for example, we shipped nine ambulances
[00:54:02.400 --> 00:54:04.800]   from Gibraltar into Ukraine.
[00:54:04.800 --> 00:54:06.400]   I thought we wouldn't be able to ship into Ukraine
[00:54:06.400 --> 00:54:08.000]   'cause it's a war zone.
[00:54:08.000 --> 00:54:09.840]   It turns out most, I don't know if most,
[00:54:09.840 --> 00:54:11.680]   but a huge percentage of European truck drivers
[00:54:11.680 --> 00:54:12.320]   are Ukrainian.
[00:54:12.320 --> 00:54:14.880]   And they were just like stoked to go and do this.
[00:54:14.880 --> 00:54:16.000]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:16.000 --> 00:54:17.360]   So we delivered nine ambulances.
[00:54:17.360 --> 00:54:18.560]   That cost like around 10 grand.
[00:54:18.560 --> 00:54:19.360]   - Yeah, so punch in--
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:20.480]   - So deliver nine ambulances.
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.240]   - I replied back to him and I said, "No problem."
[00:54:22.240 --> 00:54:23.520]   And he said, "Hey, mention it on the podcast."
[00:54:23.520 --> 00:54:24.080]   I said, "No problem."
[00:54:24.080 --> 00:54:26.640]   And I donated a $4,400 container.
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.120]   And then Shamat said, "Oh, I donated the plane
[00:54:29.120 --> 00:54:30.960]   "that 12 containers went on."
[00:54:30.960 --> 00:54:31.600]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:31.600 --> 00:54:32.000]   - He did.
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:32.560]   (audience applauding)
[00:54:32.560 --> 00:54:35.440]   - So it was a flex on a flex for Flexport.
[00:54:35.440 --> 00:54:36.000]   - Shamat donated--
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:37.520]   - It was like a multi-layer flex.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:40.080]   - So, and then it just snowballed.
[00:54:40.080 --> 00:54:41.200]   And this hasn't gotten much attention,
[00:54:41.200 --> 00:54:43.600]   but Yuri Milner, who's an early Flexport investor,
[00:54:43.600 --> 00:54:45.440]   just donated $100 million.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.400]   - Wow.
[00:54:46.400 --> 00:54:46.800]   - Wow.
[00:54:46.800 --> 00:54:47.520]   - To, yes.
[00:54:47.520 --> 00:54:50.080]   - You're really putting pressure on their side of the stage.
[00:54:50.080 --> 00:54:50.480]   - Come on, you should.
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:52.400]   - It was a flex on a flex.
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:53.360]   - I didn't hear the last part.
[00:54:53.360 --> 00:54:54.000]   Anyway, keep going.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:54:54.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:54:54.560 --> 00:54:56.640]   - Well, let me wrap up.
[00:54:56.640 --> 00:54:58.080]   - Everybody does what they can.
[00:54:58.080 --> 00:55:00.240]   And it is an amazing model where,
[00:55:00.240 --> 00:55:03.280]   but by the way, over 60,000 people donated a little bit.
[00:55:03.280 --> 00:55:04.720]   And I'm almost as just as proud of that.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:06.480]   It's like people are getting involved, stepping up.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:06.880]   - Go to Flexport.
[00:55:06.880 --> 00:55:07.920]   - Flexport.org.
[00:55:07.920 --> 00:55:09.040]   - Flexport.org.
[00:55:09.040 --> 00:55:10.080]   - People go there and support Cosmos.
[00:55:10.080 --> 00:55:10.880]   - Flexport.org.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:12.640]   - Final question for you two.
[00:55:12.880 --> 00:55:16.400]   We had this great moment where, you know, we engaged China.
[00:55:16.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   We built a bunch of iPhones, Amazon Basics,
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:19.840]   you know, whatever it is, Nike shoes.
[00:55:19.840 --> 00:55:23.040]   And it raised, you know,
[00:55:23.040 --> 00:55:24.480]   the standard of living for a lot of people.
[00:55:24.480 --> 00:55:26.080]   We understand China's doing this now.
[00:55:26.080 --> 00:55:29.280]   And they're doing it in Africa and some other places.
[00:55:29.280 --> 00:55:31.520]   What are you seeing in terms of that relationship?
[00:55:31.520 --> 00:55:34.320]   How China is looking towards other countries
[00:55:34.320 --> 00:55:37.120]   to become producers of goods.
[00:55:37.120 --> 00:55:41.440]   And they're kind of now becoming incredibly influential.
[00:55:41.440 --> 00:55:43.520]   What's their intent and how is that going?
[00:55:43.520 --> 00:55:44.640]   Claire, maybe you could start.
[00:55:44.640 --> 00:55:46.240]   - That's a big question.
[00:55:46.240 --> 00:55:48.240]   But I think it's,
[00:55:48.240 --> 00:55:52.320]   this is a long-term play.
[00:55:52.320 --> 00:55:55.200]   We're all in this for a long-term play.
[00:55:55.200 --> 00:55:59.040]   And whether, you know, you take maybe the spicier view
[00:55:59.040 --> 00:56:02.000]   around your resources and protectionism
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.280]   versus one that's more just around progress.
[00:56:05.280 --> 00:56:07.440]   And as we may have an increasingly
[00:56:07.440 --> 00:56:09.200]   vulcanizing the East and West,
[00:56:11.040 --> 00:56:13.760]   the ability for there to control the bigger piece
[00:56:13.760 --> 00:56:15.600]   of their own supply chain.
[00:56:15.600 --> 00:56:17.760]   But the end result, as you're sort of saying,
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:20.480]   is you look at places like Niger, right?
[00:56:20.480 --> 00:56:23.920]   The average mother there is having six children.
[00:56:23.920 --> 00:56:25.760]   We have a very young global South.
[00:56:25.760 --> 00:56:28.800]   And the important thing is that they're fed,
[00:56:28.800 --> 00:56:32.080]   they're clothed, and that they have an upward trajectory.
[00:56:32.080 --> 00:56:32.960]   And so that's the outcome.
[00:56:32.960 --> 00:56:35.360]   - If people living in abject poverty
[00:56:35.360 --> 00:56:37.840]   will probably end in our lifetime.
[00:56:37.840 --> 00:56:39.200]   You know, the only places it won't end
[00:56:39.200 --> 00:56:40.880]   is in places with dictators.
[00:56:40.880 --> 00:56:43.520]   What are you seeing in terms of the shipping containers?
[00:56:43.520 --> 00:56:45.840]   'Cause you must see shipping containers
[00:56:45.840 --> 00:56:48.880]   increasingly leaving certain ports.
[00:56:48.880 --> 00:56:52.720]   Where is China sort of exporting production to?
[00:56:52.720 --> 00:56:55.920]   And what are the up-and-coming production areas?
[00:56:55.920 --> 00:56:57.440]   - You know, there's some really interesting trends
[00:56:57.440 --> 00:56:59.040]   going around around labor costs.
[00:56:59.040 --> 00:57:00.640]   In China, the reason people went there
[00:57:00.640 --> 00:57:02.240]   over the last 40 years, to be honest,
[00:57:02.240 --> 00:57:03.120]   was like cheap labor.
[00:57:03.120 --> 00:57:05.680]   But over time, they became quite sophisticated.
[00:57:05.680 --> 00:57:07.200]   They really learned how to manufacture things,
[00:57:07.200 --> 00:57:08.080]   especially electronics.
[00:57:08.720 --> 00:57:09.840]   If you wanna make electronics,
[00:57:09.840 --> 00:57:11.440]   you pretty much have to make them in Shenzhen,
[00:57:11.440 --> 00:57:12.880]   the Greater Bay Area, as she called it.
[00:57:12.880 --> 00:57:17.760]   But stuff that's just for cheap labor,
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:19.200]   'cause that's no longer about cheap labor.
[00:57:19.200 --> 00:57:20.880]   This is a whole supply chain ecosystem
[00:57:20.880 --> 00:57:22.240]   of components and other things.
[00:57:22.240 --> 00:57:23.760]   And if it's just cheap labor,
[00:57:23.760 --> 00:57:26.400]   two years ago, Mexico became cheaper than China
[00:57:26.400 --> 00:57:27.200]   in labor costs.
[00:57:27.200 --> 00:57:27.760]   - Wow. - Wow.
[00:57:27.760 --> 00:57:29.040]   - Which is a huge shift.
[00:57:29.040 --> 00:57:32.160]   And now Mexico doesn't have the manufacturing capacity,
[00:57:32.160 --> 00:57:33.440]   they don't have the skill sets,
[00:57:33.440 --> 00:57:35.040]   but they'll build it, you know?
[00:57:35.040 --> 00:57:37.760]   And people will respond to that trend
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:40.080]   as long as it takes 120 days to ship stuff
[00:57:40.080 --> 00:57:41.440]   from China to the US,
[00:57:41.440 --> 00:57:42.960]   and we can't get this sorted out,
[00:57:42.960 --> 00:57:45.680]   brands are gonna respond to shipping closer to home.
[00:57:45.680 --> 00:57:48.560]   That is a trend that you're gonna see more and more of
[00:57:48.560 --> 00:57:51.520]   if the delays stay the way they are.
[00:57:51.520 --> 00:57:54.000]   I think China's big challenge is
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.280]   if they become labor costs too expensive,
[00:57:57.280 --> 00:57:58.800]   how do they keep moving up the value chain?
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:01.440]   And this is what their Made in China 2025 thing is.
[00:58:01.440 --> 00:58:04.400]   They've gotta make more and more sophisticated products
[00:58:04.400 --> 00:58:06.720]   because it can't just be about dirt cheap labor.
[00:58:06.720 --> 00:58:07.760]   - Migrate to services.
[00:58:07.760 --> 00:58:09.760]   - Yeah, and that's a huge challenge.
[00:58:09.760 --> 00:58:13.600]   Very few, if anyone's really done it,
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:14.480]   no one's done it at that scale
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:15.840]   'cause they're the biggest country in the world,
[00:58:15.840 --> 00:58:17.600]   but Japan and Korea have kind of done that,
[00:58:17.600 --> 00:58:19.120]   but not 10 times bigger population.
[00:58:19.120 --> 00:58:22.000]   - India as well, moving to a services-based economy,
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:23.680]   India with IT comes to mind,
[00:58:23.680 --> 00:58:24.800]   and then they'll become entitled
[00:58:24.800 --> 00:58:26.480]   and wanna retire at 55 like Europe.
[00:58:26.480 --> 00:58:27.040]   - Totally.
[00:58:27.040 --> 00:58:28.160]   Oh, by the way, I was just gonna try,
[00:58:28.160 --> 00:58:31.040]   my favorite answer, someone at, I think it was Zuck,
[00:58:31.040 --> 00:58:34.560]   although Toby from Shopify told me he's lifted his line,
[00:58:34.560 --> 00:58:36.640]   his employees were asking him about the four-day work week,
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:39.600]   and he was like, "Well, I do think we should do
[00:58:39.600 --> 00:58:41.840]   "some experimentation around how many days a week we work,
[00:58:41.840 --> 00:58:44.400]   "so, but we're gonna start with the six-day work week
[00:58:44.400 --> 00:58:45.200]   "like China does,
[00:58:45.200 --> 00:58:47.600]   "and then we'll try the four-day work week later."
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:50.240]   - Ladies and gentlemen, please join me in thanking him.
[00:58:50.240 --> 00:58:51.200]   (audience applauding)
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:51.600]   - Thank you.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:53.120]   - Brian and Claire, well done.
[00:58:53.120 --> 00:58:55.280]   (upbeat music)
