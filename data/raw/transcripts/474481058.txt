[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Good morning, my name is Jessie Yu,
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.140]   and I'm a second year at UCI majoring in Criminology.
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:10.560]   I grew up in a Buddhist household
[00:00:10.560 --> 00:00:12.280]   practicing religious ceremonies,
[00:00:12.280 --> 00:00:15.400]   like bowing down to idols, burning incense and papers,
[00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:17.880]   and putting plates of food at the altar.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:19.880]   However, I never understood the rituals,
[00:00:19.880 --> 00:00:22.980]   and I even questioned why I was doing so much for a god
[00:00:22.980 --> 00:00:26.440]   that I wasn't even sure existed.
[00:00:26.440 --> 00:00:28.720]   When I was eight, a friend shared with me
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:30.480]   about God on Father's Day.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:33.480]   She asked me, "Did you know we have another father,
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:35.220]   "a father in heaven?"
[00:00:35.220 --> 00:00:37.480]   I laughed, not understanding her words,
[00:00:37.480 --> 00:00:39.040]   only assuming she must have meant
[00:00:39.040 --> 00:00:41.120]   that her father passed away.
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:42.960]   Though she did not share the gospel with me,
[00:00:42.960 --> 00:00:46.040]   she introduced the existence of a heavenly father,
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.100]   and when I only knew, oh,
[00:00:48.100 --> 00:00:50.960]   when I only knew of having an earthly father.
[00:00:50.960 --> 00:00:52.480]   But afterwards, the thought of God
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:54.560]   would pop in and out of my mind.
[00:00:54.560 --> 00:00:56.680]   For some reason, whenever I needed help
[00:00:56.680 --> 00:00:58.280]   or even wanted something,
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.200]   I would turn to God, not fully understand
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:03.320]   who I was talking to or whether he existed.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:06.200]   I just wanted to entertain the thought.
[00:01:06.200 --> 00:01:08.720]   That very summer, I attended church for the first time
[00:01:08.720 --> 00:01:10.520]   through an invitation of a stranger
[00:01:10.520 --> 00:01:12.480]   my mom and I met at the park.
[00:01:12.480 --> 00:01:13.960]   I pushed my mom to let me go
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:17.440]   because the words of my friend left a curiosity in me.
[00:01:17.440 --> 00:01:19.440]   Initially, I wanted to continue attending
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:21.200]   because of the Bible stories.
[00:01:21.200 --> 00:01:23.680]   They were also new and fascinating to me.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:25.720]   I ended up attending weekly,
[00:01:25.720 --> 00:01:26.800]   and that spanned two years,
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:29.920]   with the entirety of my family eventually attending.
[00:01:29.920 --> 00:01:31.440]   My parents threw away their idols
[00:01:31.440 --> 00:01:33.280]   and became devout Christians.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:35.800]   I saw the transformation that took place in the household
[00:01:35.800 --> 00:01:37.160]   and how my parents would react
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:39.280]   to difficult situations differently
[00:01:39.280 --> 00:01:40.860]   from when they were Buddhist.
[00:01:40.860 --> 00:01:42.240]   That spoke very loudly to me
[00:01:42.240 --> 00:01:43.580]   because I was still in a place
[00:01:43.580 --> 00:01:45.920]   of attaining just head knowledge.
[00:01:45.920 --> 00:01:48.320]   Even though I confessed Christ as my savior
[00:01:48.320 --> 00:01:50.360]   around my early middle school years,
[00:01:50.360 --> 00:01:51.800]   it was really just to maintain
[00:01:51.800 --> 00:01:53.200]   the image of a good student,
[00:01:53.200 --> 00:01:54.480]   and I only accepted Christ
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:01:57.760]   because I saw him as the solution to my fear of death.
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.220]   For some reason, I was terrified of death.
[00:02:00.220 --> 00:02:02.620]   I was not struggling mentally or emotionally,
[00:02:02.620 --> 00:02:04.360]   but the fear of death gripped me to the point
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:05.480]   where there'd be nights of panic
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.820]   from attempts to fall asleep.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.520]   During those moments, I felt so hopeless and weak.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:12.400]   That pushed me to look at Christ seriously,
[00:02:12.400 --> 00:02:13.640]   but only enough for him
[00:02:13.640 --> 00:02:15.820]   as a means to overcome this fear.
[00:02:15.820 --> 00:02:17.840]   I did not place God as Lord of my life,
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.600]   nor did I pursue a personal relationship with him.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:22.140]   I just wanted heaven.
[00:02:22.140 --> 00:02:23.600]   Despite my lack of understanding
[00:02:23.600 --> 00:02:25.120]   of what it meant to be a believer,
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:27.720]   I was baptized because I thought
[00:02:27.720 --> 00:02:29.460]   that's what Christians do.
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:31.200]   I didn't evaluate where my heart was
[00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:33.540]   and if I truly understood repentance.
[00:02:33.540 --> 00:02:35.880]   As I continued to identify myself as a believer,
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:38.440]   I knew my relationship with him was absent.
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:41.460]   I did not read the Bible and only prayed occasionally.
[00:02:41.460 --> 00:02:42.760]   By the time I reached high school,
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:45.320]   I tricked myself thinking I had a solid foundation
[00:02:45.320 --> 00:02:46.400]   as I would share my faith
[00:02:46.400 --> 00:02:48.640]   and defend my Christian beliefs.
[00:02:48.640 --> 00:02:51.780]   Yet internally, I knew God was not a priority of mine.
[00:02:51.780 --> 00:02:53.620]   I would be annoyed by the time of family prayer
[00:02:53.620 --> 00:02:54.460]   that we would have
[00:02:54.460 --> 00:02:58.200]   and I had an obligatory heart for discipleship.
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:02:59.480]   I was never able to pinpoint
[00:02:59.480 --> 00:03:01.540]   why my actions were contradictory.
[00:03:01.540 --> 00:03:03.120]   I didn't like personal time with him,
[00:03:03.120 --> 00:03:05.080]   yet I was sharing about him.
[00:03:05.080 --> 00:03:06.760]   In Matthew 15, eight, it reads,
[00:03:06.760 --> 00:03:08.500]   "This people honors me with their lips,
[00:03:08.500 --> 00:03:11.160]   "but the heart is far from me."
[00:03:11.160 --> 00:03:12.520]   I acknowledged his existence,
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:14.760]   but again, my heart was far away.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:16.600]   In James 2, 19, it says,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:18.780]   "You believe that God is one, you do well.
[00:03:18.780 --> 00:03:21.320]   "Even the demons believe in shudder."
[00:03:21.320 --> 00:03:23.800]   But now I see why my attitude was like that.
[00:03:23.800 --> 00:03:25.340]   I saw God as an inconvenience
[00:03:25.340 --> 00:03:27.040]   when he interfered with my life
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:28.420]   and the things that I wanted to do
[00:03:28.420 --> 00:03:31.280]   and only accepted him when he made me feel good.
[00:03:31.280 --> 00:03:32.920]   With all worship and gratitude to God,
[00:03:32.920 --> 00:03:34.440]   that changed in college.
[00:03:34.440 --> 00:03:36.520]   Looking back, I could have easily started my life
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:37.840]   as a nominal Christian,
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:39.480]   but by the grace and love of God,
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.540]   he gave me the desire to truly learn and grow.
[00:03:42.540 --> 00:03:44.880]   College, as many say, is when faith becomes personal
[00:03:44.880 --> 00:03:46.960]   and it's up to us to pursue.
[00:03:46.960 --> 00:03:48.200]   I wanted to find a fellowship
[00:03:48.200 --> 00:03:50.040]   that was theologically grounded in scripture
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.680]   and my specific desire was to learn
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:53.840]   how to read the Bible on my own.
[00:03:53.840 --> 00:03:55.960]   I knew I had to work on my intimate bond with God
[00:03:55.960 --> 00:03:58.220]   because the absence of it convicted me.
[00:03:58.220 --> 00:03:59.680]   God had been too gracious with me
[00:03:59.680 --> 00:04:01.840]   and I realized that as he led me to Berean.
[00:04:01.840 --> 00:04:04.780]   The first time I attended Friday night Bible study,
[00:04:04.780 --> 00:04:07.920]   Pastor Nate explained how to do inductive Bible studies.
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:09.880]   All I could think of was how God answered me
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:13.400]   and that led to a true feeling of how undeserving I was,
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:15.360]   but God remains good and faithful.
[00:04:15.360 --> 00:04:16.840]   My hunger for the word was strong,
[00:04:16.840 --> 00:04:18.600]   which was something I never felt prior
[00:04:18.600 --> 00:04:20.080]   and ever since then I have been working
[00:04:20.080 --> 00:04:22.020]   in my spiritual disciplines.
[00:04:22.020 --> 00:04:24.240]   Truly understanding the gravity of the gospel
[00:04:24.240 --> 00:04:25.760]   and what it means to be a believer
[00:04:25.760 --> 00:04:27.520]   has reached clarity for me
[00:04:27.520 --> 00:04:29.440]   through personal studies of scripture,
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:31.560]   most importantly because I finally understood
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:33.360]   what being a sinner meant.
[00:04:33.360 --> 00:04:35.340]   Before I understood sin as something
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.800]   that was always going to naturally live with,
[00:04:37.800 --> 00:04:39.600]   but I did not see myself struggling with it
[00:04:39.600 --> 00:04:42.800]   because I never saw how it manifested itself in my life
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:44.120]   and I didn't understand the depth
[00:04:44.120 --> 00:04:46.960]   of how sin separated me from God eternally,
[00:04:46.960 --> 00:04:48.880]   but now I see that being a believer means
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:50.640]   I need to fight the flesh daily
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:51.880]   and live in constant repentance,
[00:04:51.880 --> 00:04:53.600]   which can only be done through Christ
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.600]   because I am forgiven and redeemed.
[00:04:55.600 --> 00:04:57.500]   That helped me view the word prayer and worship
[00:04:57.500 --> 00:04:59.780]   from being an obligation to response to God
[00:04:59.780 --> 00:05:01.200]   as I continue to grow in what it means
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.400]   to love and thank God for his sacrifice.
[00:05:03.400 --> 00:05:04.240]   Thank you.
[00:05:04.240 --> 00:05:08.340]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:08.340 --> 00:05:11.080]   (water gurgling)
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:30.380]   - Jessie, you understand when you go into the water,
[00:05:30.380 --> 00:05:32.020]   you're united with Christ in his death
[00:05:32.020 --> 00:05:32.860]   and when you come out,
[00:05:32.860 --> 00:05:34.940]   you're united with his resurrected life?
[00:05:34.940 --> 00:05:36.260]   - I do.
[00:05:36.260 --> 00:05:38.460]   - I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:05:38.460 --> 00:05:40.620]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:47.800]   (water gurgling)
