[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.400]   Romans chapter 1 I'll be reading from verse 24 all the way down to verse 32
[00:00:10.400 --> 00:00:18.200]   Romans chapter 1 verse 24 through 32 okay
[00:00:18.200 --> 00:00:26.600]   yes I'm reading out of the ESV therefore God gave them up in the loss of their
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:30.760]   hearts to impurity to the dishonoring of the bodies among themselves because they
[00:00:30.760 --> 00:00:34.760]   exchanged the truth about God for a lie and worship and serve the creature
[00:00:34.760 --> 00:00:39.320]   rather than the Creator who is blessed forever amen for this reason God gave
[00:00:39.320 --> 00:00:43.000]   them up to dishonorable passions for the woman exchanged natural relations for
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:46.960]   those that are contrary to nature and the men likewise gave up natural
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:50.620]   relations with women and were consumed with passion for one another men
[00:00:50.620 --> 00:00:54.480]   committing shameless acts with men and receiving in themselves the due penalty
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:58.880]   for the error and since they did not see fit to acknowledge God God gave them up
[00:00:58.880 --> 00:01:03.360]   to a debased mind to do what ought not to be done they were filled with all
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.240]   manner of unrighteousness evil covetousness malice they are full of
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:11.520]   envy murder strife deceit maliciousness they are gossip slanderers haters of God
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.080]   insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents foolish
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.440]   faithless heartless ruthless though they know God's decree that those who
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:25.240]   practice such things deserve to die they not only do them but give approval to
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.760]   those who practice them let's pray
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:34.480]   Heavenly Father we thank you so much for this morning we ask Lord God that what
[00:01:34.480 --> 00:01:39.960]   you have ordained in your word would reveal in our hearts Lord God where we
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:44.440]   are we pray that we would understand your grace and what it is that we
[00:01:44.440 --> 00:01:49.160]   already have in Christ in a deeper way that our life for you may not simply be
[00:01:49.160 --> 00:01:54.120]   going through the motion and just a checkoff list but to really honor and
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:59.240]   love you that our confession of and worship and adoration may be an overflow
[00:01:59.240 --> 00:02:03.280]   Lord God of an understanding of what you've given us so we pray for your
[00:02:03.280 --> 00:02:06.040]   blessing and your power of your Holy Spirit to lead and guide us in Jesus
[00:02:06.040 --> 00:02:10.760]   name we pray amen let me ask you this morning what do you
[00:02:10.760 --> 00:02:16.360]   think your life would look like if you had absolutely no accountability meaning
[00:02:16.360 --> 00:02:21.840]   that if you die that there is no heaven there is no hell there is no God and
[00:02:21.840 --> 00:02:26.960]   there is no consequence you can pretty much do whatever you want how do you
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:31.600]   think your life would be different you know possible he doesn't answer this
[00:02:31.600 --> 00:02:35.680]   question directly but indirectly he addresses this issue in first Corinthians
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.280]   15 when people were saying you know there's no resurrection from the dead
[00:02:39.280 --> 00:02:44.480]   meaning that Jesus Christ really wasn't who he said he was and so Paul responds
[00:02:44.480 --> 00:02:50.200]   that he said if the dead are not raised let us eat and drink for tomorrow we die
[00:02:50.200 --> 00:02:55.040]   meaning if there is no consequence Jesus what he said wasn't true and all this is
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:03:01.400]   a lie then just live whatever pleases you you know live out your passions and
[00:03:01.400 --> 00:03:06.440]   I think if that was true and with Paul saying is if there's no consequence and
[00:03:06.440 --> 00:03:11.080]   this is it right there's no judgment waiting there's no consequences there's
[00:03:11.080 --> 00:03:15.400]   no such thing as sin that's just something that we've made up or society
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:22.160]   has made up how would that affect our lives you know the church sometimes gets
[00:03:22.160 --> 00:03:27.280]   a bad rap and you probably talk to many people where it's out on a church as
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:32.160]   churches full of hypocrites and first and foremost whenever I hear that or if
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:35.400]   I'm on the street sharing the gospel somebody and somebody says I church a
[00:03:35.400 --> 00:03:39.400]   full hypocrites my first response is I agree with them we are hypocrites I'm
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.320]   the biggest hypocrite because I I'm here proclaiming the the excellencies of
[00:03:44.320 --> 00:03:49.360]   Christ every single Sunday and there's no way that I live up to this this you
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:54.640]   know I I talk a lot more than I'm able to practice and this is true of every
[00:03:54.640 --> 00:03:58.920]   Christian so in some ways we every single one of us to different degrees we
[00:03:58.920 --> 00:04:06.720]   are hypocrites but at the same time the kind of things that we experience in
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:11.880]   church is restraint if you've ever been in a situation where there is no
[00:04:11.880 --> 00:04:15.320]   restraint when somebody got angry and they wanted to take vengeance out on you
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:20.200]   and there was no restraint it's ugly you know if you've ever been in a work
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:24.800]   environment where where somebody thought that you did something wrong and they're
[00:04:24.800 --> 00:04:27.960]   angry with you and you don't even know why but they're taking vengeance out on
[00:04:27.960 --> 00:04:33.560]   you I mean it gets ugly you talk about filthy talk and language you go to the
[00:04:33.560 --> 00:04:36.840]   gym some of you guys may know what I'm talking about you go to the gym where
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:40.680]   there is no restraint there's no other ladies you know bunch of guys hanging
[00:04:40.680 --> 00:04:46.600]   around and they have no filter and they just say whatever I mean it gets dirty
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:52.240]   right church to certain degree even though we wrestle with slander we
[00:04:52.240 --> 00:04:57.520]   wrestle with hypocrisy there's a certain amount of restraint that there's a the
[00:04:57.520 --> 00:05:00.800]   Holy Spirit in this is always convicting us saying and that's not right you
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:03.800]   shouldn't be saying this there's accountability in the context of the
[00:05:03.800 --> 00:05:08.720]   community so even though we experience sin even in the church it is always to a
[00:05:08.720 --> 00:05:14.600]   certain degree restraint but what would what would the church look like what
[00:05:14.600 --> 00:05:20.280]   would the world look like without any restraint well the passage that we're
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:24.320]   looking at this morning in verse 24 to 32 we've been talking about God's
[00:05:24.320 --> 00:05:28.240]   judgment upon mankind and the reason why he's talking about that is because he
[00:05:28.240 --> 00:05:34.000]   wants to introduce Jesus Christ as the answer to humanity that he came to die
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:39.560]   for our sins and why this justification of our sins can only be by faith and not
[00:05:39.560 --> 00:05:44.280]   by our works so he's been establishing starting from chapter 1 but in
[00:05:44.280 --> 00:05:49.120]   particular in verse 18 all the way to chapter 3 3 full chapters to convince
[00:05:49.120 --> 00:05:55.920]   the readers that you are absolutely in need of Christ so he we talked about
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:06:01.560]   that last week on how how mankind chose chooses to worship the creation rather
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:05.640]   than the Creator how we talked about how we can celebrate the Great Wall and
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:10.040]   completely neglect the Creator of the mountain that this little wall sitting
[00:06:10.040 --> 00:06:18.560]   on but the ultimate judgment of God is explained in verse 24 to 32 and the way
[00:06:18.560 --> 00:06:23.240]   he describes it is is that God would leave them God would basically hand them
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:27.560]   over right it's kind of like if you're struggling with somebody and you try to
[00:06:27.560 --> 00:06:31.560]   correct them and you try to train them and they refuse and refuse and refuse
[00:06:31.560 --> 00:06:35.480]   and you kind of put your hands up and say okay if that's what you want go to
[00:06:35.480 --> 00:06:42.280]   it so three separate times in verse 24 26 and 28 God describes this judgment
[00:06:42.280 --> 00:06:48.000]   upon mankind why the wrath of God is being revealed he says verse 24 God gave
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.560]   them up in their lust of their hearts to impurity verse 26 God gave them up to
[00:06:53.560 --> 00:06:58.920]   dishonorable passion first 28 God gave them up to a debased mind to do what
[00:06:58.920 --> 00:07:06.040]   ought not to be done so the final judgment of God is is that he says I'm
[00:07:06.040 --> 00:07:10.200]   no longer I'm gonna wrestle with you I'm no longer gonna convict you I'm no longer
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.960]   gonna restrain you I'm gonna just let you be John MacArthur describes this
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.640]   judgment and this is what he said when a person lives guided by the mind and the
[00:07:21.640 --> 00:07:27.480]   lust and desires they are literally working out the wrath of God when you
[00:07:27.480 --> 00:07:32.520]   have an individual or a society that has no restraint and just whatever they
[00:07:32.520 --> 00:07:36.760]   please well you know I want to do this I want to go here and I want to watch this
[00:07:36.760 --> 00:07:40.080]   and I want to spend my money this way and there is no restraint whatsoever
[00:07:40.080 --> 00:07:46.120]   that they don't realize that is a wrath of God being displayed in fact in Psalm
[00:07:46.120 --> 00:07:50.600]   81 11 through 12 God describes a judgment to Israel while he was
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:55.640]   wrestling with them bringing judgment and yet they kept on refusing and this
[00:07:55.640 --> 00:08:00.680]   is how judgment against Israel described but my people did not listen to my voice
[00:08:00.680 --> 00:08:05.640]   Israel would not submit to me so I gave them over to their stubborn hearts to
[00:08:05.640 --> 00:08:10.680]   follow their own counsels he says his final judgment was when he was
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.920]   disciplined when judgment was coming upon Israel he said it was God
[00:08:13.920 --> 00:08:18.240]   disciplining them just like a father disciplining their children but the
[00:08:18.240 --> 00:08:22.680]   final judgment of God is to release them let them be
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:28.680]   Hosea chapter 4 verse 17 it describes a judgment against Ephraim because they
[00:08:28.680 --> 00:08:32.880]   kept on turning to idols and simple statement but this is what he says
[00:08:32.880 --> 00:08:40.800]   Ephraim is joined to idols and here's the judgment leave him alone it's a
[00:08:40.800 --> 00:08:48.560]   simple three words leave him alone they refused resisted rebelled and they would
[00:08:48.560 --> 00:08:52.760]   not turn from their sin repeatedly over and over again and he simply says just
[00:08:52.760 --> 00:08:58.960]   let them be in fact at the end times Paul describes the second Thessalonians
[00:08:58.960 --> 00:09:04.520]   2 9 through 10 before the coming of Christ that there's going to be a period
[00:09:04.520 --> 00:09:09.200]   of intense tribulation and he says the way you're going to know that the
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:15.120]   judgment of God is coming is that the restrainer who restrains the lawless one
[00:09:15.120 --> 00:09:20.480]   is going to take his hand off and God is going to no longer restrain the lawless
[00:09:20.480 --> 00:09:27.440]   one and let him be and it's described the name of the Antichrist is described
[00:09:27.440 --> 00:09:32.200]   as a one without law there's no restraint so the only thing that's
[00:09:32.200 --> 00:09:37.680]   restraining this lawless one is God and at the end he says he's gonna he's gonna
[00:09:37.680 --> 00:09:42.000]   release the lawless one to make disciples so a disciple of a lawless one
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:50.040]   is gonna be lawless and that's how the judgment is described how many guys know
[00:09:50.040 --> 00:09:54.240]   who Anton Lave is anybody born before 1980 probably you heard this name before
[00:09:54.240 --> 00:10:00.080]   which is some of you right Anton Lave was the founder of the first satanic
[00:10:00.080 --> 00:10:05.960]   church in the United States and he wrote a doctrinal statement yes they have a
[00:10:05.960 --> 00:10:10.360]   doctrinal statement creedal statement of the satanic church and there's nine
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:14.560]   creedal statements that if you were to be a Satanist you have to follow these
[00:10:14.560 --> 00:10:19.720]   things now out of the nine I'm gonna I'm gonna read six of them and see if any of
[00:10:19.720 --> 00:10:26.920]   these things sound familiar okay number one Satan represents indulgence instead
[00:10:26.920 --> 00:10:33.040]   of abstinence number two Satan represents kindness to those who deserve
[00:10:33.040 --> 00:10:39.880]   it instead of love wasted on ingrates Satan number three Satan represents
[00:10:39.880 --> 00:10:47.680]   vengeance instead of turning the other cheek number five Satan number four
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:52.640]   Satan represents responsibility to the responsible instead of concern for those
[00:10:52.640 --> 00:10:58.040]   who are irresponsible number five Satan represents man as just another animal
[00:10:58.040 --> 00:11:02.960]   sometimes better more often worse than those that walk on all fours who because
[00:11:02.960 --> 00:11:06.600]   of his divine spiritual intellectual development has become the most vicious
[00:11:06.600 --> 00:11:13.120]   animal of all and then number six Satan represents all the so-called sins as
[00:11:13.120 --> 00:11:18.680]   they all lead to physical mental or emotional gratification now that's the
[00:11:18.680 --> 00:11:22.760]   six out of the nine creedal statements of the satanic church and basically
[00:11:22.760 --> 00:11:27.480]   every single one of them can be represented by simply saying live
[00:11:27.480 --> 00:11:33.840]   whatever your passion is whatever it is don't let anybody restrict you every sin
[00:11:33.840 --> 00:11:38.400]   is embraced because ultimately all it needs is to gratification so it doesn't
[00:11:38.400 --> 00:11:42.760]   it doesn't go out and say kill people it doesn't say go start war it doesn't go
[00:11:42.760 --> 00:11:48.320]   say go molest children doesn't say any of that all it says is to gratify
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:53.440]   yourself gratify your anger gratify your passion gratify your sins because in the
[00:11:53.440 --> 00:11:58.480]   end it's just for you it doesn't say to come and burn incest to Satan it doesn't
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:03.760]   say you have to you know go to a satanic church all it says was don't let anybody
[00:12:03.760 --> 00:12:09.000]   restrict you live out your passion without any restriction isn't that
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.520]   interesting that in the scripture where scripture says God's ultimate judgment
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:18.560]   is to let you go to live out your passion your anger your bitterness
[00:12:18.560 --> 00:12:24.880]   whatever it may be without restraint see the text that we're going to be looking
[00:12:24.880 --> 00:12:28.320]   at this morning the three statements where he says he hands them over we want
[00:12:28.320 --> 00:12:32.040]   to look at it examine it carefully you're gonna see that in these three
[00:12:32.040 --> 00:12:36.920]   statements there is a progression and degree of debauchery that God says he's
[00:12:36.920 --> 00:12:40.040]   going to let them give them over to let's look at the first one verse 24 and
[00:12:40.040 --> 00:12:46.680]   25 God said God gave them up in the lust of their hearts to impurity to the
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:50.920]   dishonoring of their bodies among themselves because they exchanged the
[00:12:50.920 --> 00:12:54.920]   truth of God about God for a lie and worshiped and served the creature rather
[00:12:54.920 --> 00:12:59.760]   than the Creator who is blessed forever amen so first of all he says God hands
[00:12:59.760 --> 00:13:03.640]   him over and again this connects us to the previous passage where God says it's
[00:13:03.640 --> 00:13:08.560]   because you refuse to acknowledge God as the Creator and you rather worship the
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:13.400]   creation and the language he uses here is that he exchanged the truth of God
[00:13:13.400 --> 00:13:17.920]   the glory of God for a lie and worship the creation instead there was an
[00:13:17.920 --> 00:13:22.440]   exchange there was a deliberate exchange so I don't want to worship God I want to
[00:13:22.440 --> 00:13:27.280]   follow the world you know as I was reading this text I remember a specific
[00:13:27.280 --> 00:13:32.360]   incident you know when we used to go out to Santa Ana every Tuesday to feed the
[00:13:32.360 --> 00:13:35.040]   homeless and I remember this one particular girl and she must have been
[00:13:35.040 --> 00:13:38.480]   no more than 17 18 years looked like a high school student or maybe right out
[00:13:38.480 --> 00:13:43.000]   of high school blonde hair blue eye five feet seven looked like a cheerleader and
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.760]   so obviously she was way out of place this is seven eight o'clock at night
[00:13:46.760 --> 00:13:50.960]   Tuesday and typically the only people out there are people who are getting
[00:13:50.960 --> 00:13:54.880]   food or churches were out there feeding because it's not a safe place to be
[00:13:54.880 --> 00:13:59.120]   because there's a lot of drug activity at least it was at that time so with us
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:02.280]   she's she's kind of out of place just walking around and I remember every
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:05.120]   Tuesday night we would come we would see her there and then eventually we figured
[00:14:05.120 --> 00:14:10.360]   out what was happening she was selling her body to get drugs and so she wasn't
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:13.360]   near where we were we were watching her from a distance maybe about half a block
[00:14:13.360 --> 00:14:18.480]   away but every time we come we would see her and we never got to talk to her she
[00:14:18.480 --> 00:14:23.240]   never came our way but we're watching this and I saw this unravel probably in
[00:14:23.240 --> 00:14:27.600]   the span of maybe about four or five six months and I didn't see her every
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:32.760]   Tuesday but I saw her in that span enough where I could see the digression
[00:14:32.760 --> 00:14:36.800]   you know where she was being hooked on drugs and people were telling me the
[00:14:36.800 --> 00:14:39.200]   guys who were in that area would come back and say what's going on with that
[00:14:39.200 --> 00:14:43.960]   girl and then found out she's selling her body and then she eventually got so
[00:14:43.960 --> 00:14:47.400]   hooked on drugs she ended up coming out in the streets and then if you're out in
[00:14:47.400 --> 00:14:51.000]   the streets it's dangerous so you kind of have to be connected with some of the
[00:14:51.000 --> 00:14:55.560]   guys out in the streets for protection and I remember watching that whole
[00:14:55.560 --> 00:15:00.120]   digression looking at that thinking wow at least on the surface I don't know
[00:15:00.120 --> 00:15:04.400]   what was going on at home for her but at least on the surface I mean she looked
[00:15:04.400 --> 00:15:07.720]   like a cheerleader she looked like you know one of the girls who would be popular
[00:15:07.720 --> 00:15:11.240]   in high school when she was out there exchanging her body and doing drugs and
[00:15:11.240 --> 00:15:15.840]   again after about six months I stopped seeing her again reason why I had this
[00:15:15.840 --> 00:15:20.040]   picture in my head is because when the scripture talks about the judgment of
[00:15:20.040 --> 00:15:27.800]   God God describes this as a deliberate exchange exchange from worshipping and
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:33.040]   honoring and following the truth of God his glory and then and then and it
[00:15:33.040 --> 00:15:39.160]   abandoned all of that and chase after foolish things so he says therefore God
[00:15:39.160 --> 00:15:44.080]   gave them over to the lust of the impurity dishonoring of their bodies
[00:15:44.080 --> 00:15:51.000]   talking about sexual impurity sexual immorality if you read the New Testament
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:55.240]   and the Old Testament but in particular New Testament whenever Paul or the
[00:15:55.240 --> 00:16:01.320]   Apostles describes a list of debauchery list of sins almost always sexual
[00:16:01.320 --> 00:16:06.200]   immorality is at the top of the list now I've mentioned this before whenever you
[00:16:06.200 --> 00:16:10.920]   see a list in the Bible it is not done randomly if you look at the list of the
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.200]   twelve disciples Peter's name is always on the top the three in the inner
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:18.960]   circle is always on the top and there's a reason for that because at that time
[00:16:18.960 --> 00:16:22.680]   when they wrote things the people who are the most prominent were usually on
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:25.840]   the top of the list so whenever they made a list of something whatever is on
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:29.680]   the top of the list is there for on purpose that it is meant to be
[00:16:29.680 --> 00:16:33.520]   highlighted that this is something that you ought to pay attention to so every
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:38.960]   time there's a list of sins sexual immorality is on the top of that list it
[00:16:38.960 --> 00:16:45.280]   is highlighted in fact Paul says it and he distinguishes this particular sin in
[00:16:45.280 --> 00:16:50.000]   first Corinthians 618 he says flee sexual immorality he didn't say sit and
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:55.240]   fight he doesn't say combat it he doesn't he said first and foremost flee
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:59.760]   sexual immorality every other sin a person commits outside the body but the
[00:16:59.760 --> 00:17:05.840]   sexual immoral person sins against his own body so yes there are other sins
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:11.600]   there's other things that that corrode our society corrode us but he highlights
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:18.320]   this sexual sin as being devastating first Corinthians 7 - Paul says but
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:21.880]   because of this temptation to sexual morality each man should have his own
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:29.120]   wife and each woman her own husband it was so prominent at that time and I
[00:17:29.120 --> 00:17:34.120]   believe today he says it's better to be married it's better and don't deny
[00:17:34.120 --> 00:17:40.040]   yourself for that purpose first Thessalonians 4 3 & 5 know how many of
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:42.560]   you okay don't raise your hands a rhetorical question how many of you
[00:17:42.560 --> 00:17:46.680]   sitting here thinking about what is the will of God maybe some of you freshmen
[00:17:46.680 --> 00:17:50.240]   came into college thinking what's God's will for me should I be you know I
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:54.320]   should I be a doctor should I be you know a you know go into business and you
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:58.200]   have all these so what is the will of God some of you are on the verge of
[00:17:58.200 --> 00:18:01.440]   dating somebody is this the will of God should I marry this person not marry
[00:18:01.440 --> 00:18:06.240]   this person should I have another child should I move my job that's probably one
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:10.160]   of the number one things that people ask for counsel like I want to know the will
[00:18:10.160 --> 00:18:14.800]   of God the Bible doesn't describe the will of God specifically that way and
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.080]   said God's will for you is to marry this person I mean you could search through
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:23.040]   scripture but it's not there right there is no halo on that person that
[00:18:23.040 --> 00:18:25.840]   you're supposed to marry you walk around oh there she is you know God said that's
[00:18:25.840 --> 00:18:30.920]   the will of God for the most part you have to use sound judgment seek counsel
[00:18:30.920 --> 00:18:36.000]   right ask older brothers just be wise about how you choose but there are
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:41.880]   specific things that God has said this is the will of God and he uses that
[00:18:41.880 --> 00:18:46.040]   language and first that's known as 4 3 it says this for this is the will of God
[00:18:46.040 --> 00:18:53.920]   your sanctification your holiness that this is the will of God so before we
[00:18:53.920 --> 00:18:57.200]   come to God and say God do you want me to have this job or that job or this
[00:18:57.200 --> 00:19:01.160]   major or that major or marry this person or that person before we can ask that
[00:19:01.160 --> 00:19:07.480]   question we have to understand that God's primary desire primary will is our
[00:19:07.480 --> 00:19:12.480]   sanctification our holiness so if we're ignoring that and then we're coming to
[00:19:12.480 --> 00:19:17.520]   God saying I want to know all of this other stuff you know we have this thing
[00:19:17.520 --> 00:19:20.280]   backward but here's I'm going to continue so for this is the will of God
[00:19:20.280 --> 00:19:29.560]   your sanctification that you abstain from sexual immorality specifically the
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:33.200]   first and foremost before we wrestle with what does God want for me in my
[00:19:33.200 --> 00:19:37.400]   life that we need to know absolutely crystal clear that what God wants is
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:44.960]   sexual purity and this thing is again highlighted above other sins in fact in
[00:19:44.960 --> 00:19:49.760]   Peter first Peter 2 11 he says beloved I urge you as sojourners and exiles to
[00:19:49.760 --> 00:19:54.520]   abstain from passions of the flesh referring to sexual immorality which
[00:19:54.520 --> 00:20:01.580]   wage war against your soul it wages war against our soul that's why again the
[00:20:01.580 --> 00:20:06.740]   reason why Paul highlights this is because if we compromise if we make
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.800]   excuses if we allow that say yeah you know it's no big deal in fact I run into
[00:20:11.800 --> 00:20:16.640]   people all the time we say it doesn't bother me right I bothers MP what doesn't
[00:20:16.640 --> 00:20:21.800]   bother me the fact that it doesn't bother us is actually a bigger problem
[00:20:21.800 --> 00:20:26.240]   that our conscience have become so seared that we are shocked by less and
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:30.520]   less things that is not because you're mature because our conscience has become
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:34.220]   seared he says is waging war against your soul an individual whose whose
[00:20:34.220 --> 00:20:39.560]   conscience has been seared because we've compromised to the point where our soul
[00:20:39.560 --> 00:20:46.400]   is at war and you don't even recognize it it is a condition the scripture says
[00:20:46.400 --> 00:20:52.800]   that will happen when we sin against God again and again God says okay I hand you
[00:20:52.800 --> 00:20:59.420]   over to this in fact this this sin is so prevalent in our culture and I'm not
[00:20:59.420 --> 00:21:03.860]   just talking about our society and morality I'm talking about even finance
[00:21:03.860 --> 00:21:10.120]   even our economy is influenced by pornography again those of you who are
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:14.200]   around in the 80s you know there was a big debate at that time again I know
[00:21:14.200 --> 00:21:18.960]   this is outdated and Esther will make fun of me later at home you know and
[00:21:18.960 --> 00:21:24.800]   back in the 80s there was a discussion between is the VHS or the beta going to
[00:21:24.800 --> 00:21:29.120]   be you know going to to take off okay some guy's looking at me what the what
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:33.160]   is beta right okay so you guys know what I'm talking about basically you know
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:36.640]   what a VHS is right I should have brought one to show you okay now
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:42.640]   everything's DVD okay so VHS is about this size in which we still have right
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:47.400]   back in the 80s the VHS and beta came out at the same time and I think beta
[00:21:47.400 --> 00:21:51.960]   was from Sony I forget but there was this big debate like I said because
[00:21:51.960 --> 00:21:56.400]   they're they did the same thing and the quality was just the same but the beta
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:00.920]   was just smaller and the machine was small so beta video machines were about
[00:22:00.920 --> 00:22:04.600]   this big and the VHS was that that big and so when I heard that they were
[00:22:04.600 --> 00:22:08.160]   debating which way to go saying why would that even be a question you go
[00:22:08.160 --> 00:22:11.760]   beta because it's smaller same price does the same thing why would you not go
[00:22:11.760 --> 00:22:16.320]   this way and then I heard and I read on the news that it's actually going
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:21.320]   toward VHS and eventually beta is gonna disappear and the reasoning behind this
[00:22:21.320 --> 00:22:27.880]   was that the porn industry made a made a deal with the people who are making VHS
[00:22:27.880 --> 00:22:32.920]   that they're gonna use VHS as their primary way of recording pornography and
[00:22:32.920 --> 00:22:37.680]   that's when I found out the reason why they made such a big deal is because so
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:42.320]   much of the money that was being spent for these VHS was coming from the porn
[00:22:42.320 --> 00:22:48.520]   industry whatever they decided to go by was what was going to win and that's why
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:55.120]   we have VHS today at least in my closet by your closet okay now now even VHS is
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:00.960]   dead right that's how much impact that the porn industry in our culture has
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:06.280]   again nobody more now on television you know the in sitcoms they're very open
[00:23:06.280 --> 00:23:12.120]   about watching porn but in larger society it's something hidden in behind
[00:23:12.120 --> 00:23:20.040]   the scene today let me give you some statistics about online pornography 35%
[00:23:20.040 --> 00:23:25.440]   of all internet downloads are related to pornography are you surprised by that
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:32.520]   35% it's not Netflix it's not movies not YouTube is it it's pornography 25% of
[00:23:32.520 --> 00:23:37.320]   all search engine queries are related to pornography or about 68 million search
[00:23:37.320 --> 00:23:42.520]   queries a day so one in four times somebody puts something in the search
[00:23:42.520 --> 00:23:47.640]   engine is related to pornography search engines get hundred and sixteen thousand
[00:23:47.640 --> 00:23:54.880]   queries every day related to child pornography okay 34% of internet users
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:58.960]   have experienced unwanted exposure to pornographic content through ads pop-up
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:02.800]   ads misdirected links or emails in other words you don't even have to go look for
[00:24:02.800 --> 00:24:07.760]   they're gonna come look for you 2.5 billion emails sent or received every
[00:24:07.760 --> 00:24:15.480]   day contain porn 2.5 billion this is daily every 39 minutes a new pornography
[00:24:15.480 --> 00:24:23.040]   video is being created in the United States every 39 minutes no wonder it
[00:24:23.040 --> 00:24:31.760]   affects the economy on the underlying currency which is kind of dictating the
[00:24:31.760 --> 00:24:38.480]   internet is pornography what content is chosen to be on what website is dictated
[00:24:38.480 --> 00:24:42.800]   by pornography you think the advertisers don't know this they know it they know
[00:24:42.800 --> 00:24:47.200]   that 25% of the time when people are online they're looking for porn so do
[00:24:47.200 --> 00:24:51.360]   you think that affects what kind of advertisement comes on websites and how
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:57.080]   it directs you what's on YouTube what's on Facebook right it is we are bombarded
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:25:03.480]   by this and I know I know that a lot of us you know let's be honest that that is
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.800]   a struggle that is behind the scenes let me go further and how this erodes not
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:13.400]   only individually but families he said 47% of families in the United States
[00:25:13.400 --> 00:25:20.040]   reported that pornography is a problem in their homes 47 that's almost 50% one
[00:25:20.040 --> 00:25:24.200]   out of two families it's a problem pornography use increases the material
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:33.600]   marital infidelity rate by more than 300% so 50% on 47% of households where
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:37.840]   this is a problem that doesn't mean the other you know 53% is not an issue he
[00:25:37.840 --> 00:25:42.000]   says it's it's gone to a point where it's a problem this is not a survey of a
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   particular church or an area this is broad that means 300% more likely that
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:54.600]   there's going to be infidelity 40% of sex addicts lose their spouses 58%
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:26:01.800]   suffer considerable financial loss and about third lose their jobs scripture
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:08.880]   says that because we exchange the glory of God for things made by men God hands
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:12.720]   over when God's hands over the one of the first things that happen is sexual
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:18.080]   immorality I mean I don't think I need to convince you that you and I see it
[00:26:18.080 --> 00:26:22.600]   all around us and how rapidly it's growing because of the internet you know
[00:26:22.600 --> 00:26:26.440]   they're struggling with pornography at one point used to be having enough
[00:26:26.440 --> 00:26:29.840]   courage and going to a video store and being embarrassed now it's on your
[00:26:29.840 --> 00:26:34.440]   phones in every Christian every young man every young woman has it on their
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:38.840]   phone private no one else watches it but you so the temptation is greater than
[00:26:38.840 --> 00:26:44.360]   ever but here's I don't want to keep going on this because the second part of
[00:26:44.360 --> 00:26:48.120]   this he goes from sexual morality and he goes he dies even a little bit deeper on
[00:26:48.120 --> 00:26:53.120]   this and he says for this reason verse 26 to 27 the second handing over says
[00:26:53.120 --> 00:26:57.600]   for this reason God gave him up to dishonorable passions for their for their
[00:26:57.600 --> 00:27:02.320]   woman exchange natural relations for those that are contrary to nature and
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:06.440]   the men likewise gave up natural relations with women and were consumed
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:10.080]   with passion for one another men committing shameless acts with men and
[00:27:10.080 --> 00:27:14.840]   receiving in themselves a due penalty for their error now one of these days
[00:27:14.840 --> 00:27:20.120]   we're gonna have a whole day dedicated in exploring what the scripture says
[00:27:20.120 --> 00:27:25.040]   what the arguments are and how we're going to deal with this and and I don't
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:28.160]   have time today to go too deep into this but I want to make this absolutely
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:33.260]   crystal clear because we're in this text I've been hearing more and more in the
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:37.480]   Christian community sometimes even in Bible teaching churches that the Bible
[00:27:37.480 --> 00:27:42.240]   does not teach this because of the pressure because of the propaganda in
[00:27:42.240 --> 00:27:49.040]   our generation that this is not true that that the church has has basically
[00:27:49.040 --> 00:27:52.840]   dissected it and and added and basically perverted what the scripture says and
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:55.320]   that is not what the scriptures and I want to make this absolutely crystal
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:28:01.160]   clear that what you just read is what it says in the Greek there's nothing hidden
[00:28:01.160 --> 00:28:09.120]   here he says when sexual morality that is taken to its effect and just kind of
[00:28:09.120 --> 00:28:13.360]   run free there's no boundaries is that one of the things that happens is that
[00:28:13.360 --> 00:28:18.500]   dishonorable passions lead to women exchanging natural relations with women
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:26.040]   men exchanging natural relations with with women and practice homosexuality
[00:28:26.040 --> 00:28:30.320]   now I know in this room especially some of you who are new to this church may
[00:28:30.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   have may never have been confronted with this issue maybe maybe you've been
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:38.000]   having discussions and arguments with your friends sometimes even Christian
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.080]   friends saying that this is not what the scripture says one of the arguments
[00:28:42.080 --> 00:28:47.000]   against this this particular passage is that when he says natural he's not
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.800]   talking about God's creation that again this is one of the arguments that they
[00:28:51.800 --> 00:28:55.560]   make against this to nullify this text is that what God meant natural is
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:00.800]   somebody was naturally heterosexual to practice heterosexuality and somebody
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:05.080]   was naturally homosexual to practice homosexuality so what he's what he's
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:10.520]   going against is a natural homosexual practicing heterosexuality and natural
[00:29:10.520 --> 00:29:16.560]   heterosexual practicing homosexuality and the reason why they say that is
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:21.920]   because well they were born that way so therefore that they're practicing what
[00:29:21.920 --> 00:29:26.720]   is natural to them so what he's saying is what is unnatural so one the only
[00:29:26.720 --> 00:29:31.440]   reason why you get that is because you're you're changing the meaning of
[00:29:31.440 --> 00:29:36.240]   what he says here so you read it for yourself is he talking about a natural
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:40.240]   homosexual practice heterosexuality or is he talking about God's intended
[00:29:40.240 --> 00:29:44.480]   purpose and creation and let me make this absolutely crystal clear he's
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.960]   talking about what God intended how God created male and female and how he
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:56.560]   created Eve for the purpose of what for procreation it wasn't good for man to be
[00:29:56.560 --> 00:30:01.480]   alone so he created Eve's so that they would have what sex that they would have
[00:30:01.480 --> 00:30:06.880]   relations and through that process that they will be fruitful and multiply and
[00:30:06.880 --> 00:30:10.480]   so to have a relationship between man and a man and woman and woman is
[00:30:10.480 --> 00:30:15.720]   unnatural that's what this text is saying now the argument that we have as
[00:30:15.720 --> 00:30:19.160]   well it's unnatural well what if they were born that way that's natural so
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:25.760]   they practice practice homosexuality okay let me try to argue it this way you
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.720]   know Esther every once in a while will say Peter you've been born with extra
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:34.640]   amount of testosterone right and I know why she says it you know she said if you
[00:30:34.640 --> 00:30:38.200]   have extra you're kind of like a Neanderthal you know and you're thinking
[00:30:38.200 --> 00:30:44.880]   so that's why it's a joke in our house right let me let me ask you is monogamy
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:54.000]   natural in fact after the Supreme Court decision that discussion has opened up
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.680]   and more and more people saying that monogamy is not natural because
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:03.120]   naturally you are filled with lust naturally you don't want to be you with
[00:31:03.120 --> 00:31:06.920]   just one person so even if you are married even if you're in a monogamous
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.760]   relationship your natural desire is to have physical relations with the
[00:31:11.760 --> 00:31:17.160]   opposite sex whether you're married or not so if you have this impulse did you
[00:31:17.160 --> 00:31:22.680]   put that in there did you choose that no you were born with that impulse so to
[00:31:22.680 --> 00:31:26.440]   use the argument that you are born with this particular impulse so therefore it's
[00:31:26.440 --> 00:31:33.160]   natural so therefore it is not sin you have to argue that our natural impulse
[00:31:33.160 --> 00:31:37.480]   to have sex with as many people as possible should not be called sin
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:43.600]   because we naturally have that instinct now we will argue that a very few people
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:50.280]   who argue for homosexuality will argue vehemently against polygamy and
[00:31:50.280 --> 00:31:57.120]   against adultery here's the problem what the scripture says that all have sinned
[00:31:57.120 --> 00:32:01.800]   and fall short of the glory of God meaning not only homosexual tendencies
[00:32:01.800 --> 00:32:08.160]   but even heterosexual tendencies have been perverted so even our desire to
[00:32:08.160 --> 00:32:13.400]   have sexual relations with everybody we've been born with this sinful nature
[00:32:13.400 --> 00:32:17.960]   so simply to disqualify because somebody was born and they didn't choose to be
[00:32:17.960 --> 00:32:21.880]   that way so therefore it can't be sin that means nothing we naturally desire
[00:32:21.880 --> 00:32:26.240]   is sin we naturally want to be better than somebody else so if we naturally
[00:32:26.240 --> 00:32:32.880]   lie you know and we latch naturally cheat right we have extras extra level
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.600]   testosterone and you happen to be more aggressive and angry than an average
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:40.200]   person then that's not your fault because you were born that way we would
[00:32:40.200 --> 00:32:44.960]   never argue that if somebody who is more aggressive take out their aggression
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:48.160]   against somebody else we would say no you got to stop that that's wrong you
[00:32:48.160 --> 00:32:53.200]   can't behave that way well we imagine if that person but I was born with extra
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.840]   testosterone right no one ever would ever excuse that because that behavior
[00:32:57.840 --> 00:33:03.080]   we say is wrong see the scripture tells us that every single one of us whether
[00:33:03.080 --> 00:33:07.640]   you are a heterosexual or homosexual all of our sexual tendencies have been
[00:33:07.640 --> 00:33:12.600]   perverted in the fall and so the way that Paul describes it is that when he
[00:33:12.600 --> 00:33:16.480]   hands us over sexually there is perversion and then this leads to
[00:33:16.480 --> 00:33:23.240]   specifically not in every case but in some cases homosexuality if there was
[00:33:23.240 --> 00:33:27.220]   any question whether the scripture taught this or not Leviticus 18 22 it
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:33.680]   says you shall not lie with a male or as with a woman it is an abomination in
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:37.600]   Leviticus 20 13 if a man lies with a male as with the woman both of them have
[00:33:37.600 --> 00:33:41.000]   committed an abomination they shall surely be put to death their blood is
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:46.800]   upon them some people have argued that the word homosexual is not in the New
[00:33:46.800 --> 00:33:50.920]   Testament and they are absolutely correct the word homosexual that
[00:33:50.920 --> 00:33:55.440]   literally that word is not in the New Testament but I'll tell you what the what
[00:33:55.440 --> 00:33:59.680]   the word is that has been translated homosexual in the New Testament the
[00:33:59.680 --> 00:34:05.280]   Greek word that has been translated homosexual is arsenic coitus arsenic
[00:34:05.280 --> 00:34:08.600]   coitus now you don't need to remember that word but basically that word
[00:34:08.600 --> 00:34:15.360]   literally means male lying with male that's what that word means is two words
[00:34:15.360 --> 00:34:21.320]   put together male lying with male and so in first Corinthians 6 9 and first
[00:34:21.320 --> 00:34:26.840]   Timothy 1 9 that word arsenic coitus instead of saying male lying with male
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:31.480]   they just said homosexuality so if anybody comes up to you and tells you
[00:34:31.480 --> 00:34:36.480]   that that is not what the scripture says I hope you took notes right that you are
[00:34:36.480 --> 00:34:40.680]   able to defend this but the Bible clearly does teach this now I want you
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:45.280]   to see the propaganda and and I'll bet from my experience that some of you
[00:34:45.280 --> 00:34:50.920]   have already been affected by this propaganda what percentage do you think
[00:34:50.920 --> 00:34:57.880]   of people in the world would claim to be homosexuals don't say it okay because
[00:34:57.880 --> 00:35:01.760]   I'm gonna end up correcting you right I think the number how many of you heard
[00:35:01.760 --> 00:35:09.520]   whether you agree how many of you heard the percentage about 10% oh really and
[00:35:09.520 --> 00:35:14.400]   nobody wants to admit it all right 10% 10% is the term that's been hanging
[00:35:14.400 --> 00:35:20.400]   around probably since the 70s and 80s that I remember and and the term 10%
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:25.160]   that's been floating around and it may be different now but it comes from a man
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:29.640]   named Alfred Kinsey somebody guys may have heard his name he was a guy who
[00:35:29.640 --> 00:35:35.680]   supposedly began a sexual revolution and he tested sexual morality to its limits
[00:35:35.680 --> 00:35:39.960]   and then he was known to be a homosexual himself and he said from his study he
[00:35:39.960 --> 00:35:45.640]   says that he encountered about 10% of the population being gay so since then
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:52.600]   that term 10% has been thrown around 10% is gay 10% is gay well in 2000 US census
[00:35:52.600 --> 00:35:56.960]   and this is us and this is not a Christian study a US census says that
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.720]   less than 1% of Americans identified that they came from homosexual families
[00:36:01.720 --> 00:36:04.920]   now that is not an accurate number because they're talking about households
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:09.400]   and there's a lot of people who may be gay in closet and they're not coming out
[00:36:09.400 --> 00:36:12.880]   and saying it so that may not be an accurate number but the more accurate
[00:36:12.880 --> 00:36:17.440]   number comes from family research report and they found that two to three percent
[00:36:17.440 --> 00:36:23.920]   of men have declared that they have homosexual tendencies and about 2% of
[00:36:23.920 --> 00:36:27.640]   females identified as homosexual tendencies and that's a big drop in
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:32.880]   number from 10 that more to 2 to 2 to 3 percent in fact I found other surveys
[00:36:32.880 --> 00:36:36.840]   where it was actually one or less than 1% now we don't know for sure what
[00:36:36.840 --> 00:36:41.840]   percent is accurate but what's interesting is they the Gallup poll
[00:36:41.840 --> 00:36:45.200]   again this has nothing to do with Christian Christian agenda it wasn't
[00:36:45.200 --> 00:36:50.560]   done by a Christian group a Gallup poll who takes surveys of politicians and and
[00:36:50.560 --> 00:36:54.960]   it's their whole business is just take surveys they went out and surveyed
[00:36:54.960 --> 00:37:01.720]   Americans of what they thought today number of people who claim to be gay
[00:37:01.720 --> 00:37:11.280]   average estimate was 21% to 22% average estimate okay a fourth of the people who
[00:37:11.280 --> 00:37:16.320]   are interviewed surveyed that they believe 20 that 25% or more of the
[00:37:16.320 --> 00:37:22.160]   population is gay so the actual number and the number that people generally
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:29.840]   think are gay in society is off by 20 some percent that's a huge margin now
[00:37:29.840 --> 00:37:37.640]   why is that because of propaganda because the media and the politicians
[00:37:37.640 --> 00:37:43.640]   and the sitcoms and the entertainers have deliberately pushed this agenda to
[00:37:43.640 --> 00:37:49.360]   normalize homosexuality in our culture and so you have a generation who thinks
[00:37:49.360 --> 00:37:54.520]   that we're surrounded everybody is this way but in reality we're not even close
[00:37:54.520 --> 00:37:58.920]   in fact I actually saw a survey of an interviewer going out on the streets and
[00:37:58.920 --> 00:38:02.600]   they went and interviewed a bunch of people who attended a gay pride parade
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:07.800]   and they asked them and if you ask them some of them went as high as 40 50 60
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:12.760]   percent and they weren't joking I mean to them maybe that's their reality
[00:38:12.760 --> 00:38:18.000]   because that's their culture the reason why I bring this up is because you and
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:22.760]   I have been bombarded with billions of dollars with entertainment and songs and
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:29.640]   politicians to bash anybody who says that this is wrong and some of you have
[00:38:29.640 --> 00:38:34.680]   been affected by it and so whenever you hear any argument about this there's a
[00:38:34.680 --> 00:38:40.280]   knee-jerk reaction that this is ancient this is what the Nazis did to the Jews
[00:38:40.280 --> 00:38:44.840]   this is what the slave owners did to slavery slaves long time ago and so we
[00:38:44.840 --> 00:38:51.680]   need to liberate when the scripture makes it absolutely crystal clear that
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:58.240]   this was a result of God letting go God letting go if this if you want to keep
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:05.600]   running this way I'm gonna let you go in Romans chapter 1 28 through 32 it
[00:39:05.600 --> 00:39:10.320]   describes a third letting go and he bombards us with all of these things and
[00:39:10.320 --> 00:39:15.200]   and again I want to conclude with this since they did not see fit to
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:20.960]   acknowledge God God gave him up to a debased mind to do what ought not to be
[00:39:20.960 --> 00:39:27.480]   done so once that floodgates been open right once that's been challenged and
[00:39:27.480 --> 00:39:30.560]   there's no boundaries and just kind of do whatever you think is right he said
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:34.400]   once the mind has been debased he said they are filled with the manner of all
[00:39:34.400 --> 00:39:39.040]   manners of unrighteousness evil covetousness malice they are full of
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:44.200]   envy murder strife deceit maliciousness there are gossips slanderers haters of
[00:39:44.200 --> 00:39:49.000]   God insolent haughty boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents foolish
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:54.520]   faithless heartless ruthless of all the list of sins in the New Testament this
[00:39:54.520 --> 00:40:00.800]   is the longest and the reason why Paul goes to this length to almost
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:06.040]   redundantly talk about these issues he's trying to make a point that when God
[00:40:06.040 --> 00:40:14.080]   releases his restraining power that this is what it leads to now here's the
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.840]   conclusion here's a point that I want to get at if you hear all of this at the
[00:40:19.840 --> 00:40:25.440]   end of the sermon all that happened to you was sitting there thinking yeah
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:31.360]   those people those people I knew it you know I've been discussing with my
[00:40:31.360 --> 00:40:35.880]   friends and yeah that's that's that's perversion that is not right thank God
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:44.040]   I'm not like them this passage was written to the church he's reminding the
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:49.960]   church that this is who we were this is what he saved us from so here's the
[00:40:49.960 --> 00:40:53.880]   mistake that we make whenever we read passes like especially in this context
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.640]   of homosexuality because it is so prevalent in our culture that we can
[00:40:57.640 --> 00:41:03.040]   make the mistake on this end we say you know what because you can no longer be
[00:41:03.040 --> 00:41:07.080]   in between anymore if if you've been trying to be a cool Christian where
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:11.640]   you're cool in the world and and godly in that church you can no longer do that
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:17.680]   because they drew the line in fact God drew the line long time ago but you can
[00:41:17.680 --> 00:41:21.020]   no longer be too because you can't say that this is what you believe you
[00:41:21.020 --> 00:41:24.800]   believe in the Bible and you believe that homosexuality is wrong immediately
[00:41:24.800 --> 00:41:29.640]   you can be the nicest person in the world but they will cut you off for that
[00:41:29.640 --> 00:41:36.360]   purpose alone so the mistake that we can make is to become timid or maybe just
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:41.080]   kind of buy into it because he's easier because there's definitely more pressure
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:45.920]   in the world than you might feel pressure in the church for holding this
[00:41:45.920 --> 00:41:48.920]   view in the church is kind of let's be gracious and you may hold on to this
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.800]   view but definitely you'll be bombarded in the world so the mistake that we can
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:56.040]   make is to kind of like you haven't really made a decision but you kind of
[00:41:56.040 --> 00:41:59.960]   you know fall on this I don't want to be judgmental who am I to judge and that's
[00:41:59.960 --> 00:42:03.680]   the mistake that we make and our witness doesn't be isn't clear and we're
[00:42:03.680 --> 00:42:07.880]   compromising the standard of God but here's the other mistake that we make
[00:42:07.880 --> 00:42:13.240]   that's that in the other mistake that we make is that we hear this and we say
[00:42:13.240 --> 00:42:18.280]   yeah that's that's disgusting you know those sinners thank God I'm not like
[00:42:18.280 --> 00:42:25.360]   them and the problem that you and I need to confess the mistake that you and I
[00:42:25.360 --> 00:42:33.560]   again including us is that the sinners the homosexual the prostitute whoever
[00:42:33.560 --> 00:42:39.880]   they may be all they heard from us was how disgusted we are with their sin and
[00:42:39.880 --> 00:42:45.720]   I'm not saying you did it I'm not saying I did it but as a community and it is a
[00:42:45.720 --> 00:42:50.920]   mistake for us to read this and say thank God I'm not like them because he's
[00:42:50.920 --> 00:42:56.840]   writing this to us that this description that he gives about slanderers gossiper
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:00.680]   haters of God haughty boastful inventors of evil disobedient to parents foolish
[00:43:00.680 --> 00:43:06.160]   faithless heartless ruthless our mind becoming debased that all of this is
[00:43:06.160 --> 00:43:12.400]   what God had mercy on us he saved us from this this is who we would have been
[00:43:12.400 --> 00:43:17.200]   and so when we look at the world when we look at homosexuality and the
[00:43:17.200 --> 00:43:26.680]   homosexuals that our responses and disgust but compassion is when we point
[00:43:26.680 --> 00:43:33.720]   out sins of others and and not even a little bit broken for our own sins where
[00:43:33.720 --> 00:43:41.240]   you're gonna get a reaction from the world see body odor always we can always
[00:43:41.240 --> 00:43:49.240]   tolerate our body odor more than someone else's true how many of you is like I'm
[00:43:49.240 --> 00:43:53.160]   okay with other people I just can't stand my body odor my body odor is it is
[00:43:53.160 --> 00:44:01.160]   particularly pungent you know you know most people will even though they may
[00:44:01.160 --> 00:44:06.080]   stink they may well and play basketball all day and you stink but you live with
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:10.240]   this you get in the car and your friend play basketball too and then he gets
[00:44:10.240 --> 00:44:20.280]   into the car oh my gosh you stink yeah get out right but then you were fine
[00:44:20.280 --> 00:44:27.920]   when you smelled your stink see that's us that's a sinner you know we're
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.120]   disgusted with the sins of the world and we don't recognize a sin that is so
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:37.800]   close to us all have sin and fall short of the glory of God instead of phone
[00:44:37.800 --> 00:44:41.080]   pointing fingers and fighting the world and being disgusted that we would have
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:48.440]   compassion for them because we were saved from our sins from our sexual
[00:44:48.440 --> 00:44:54.880]   impurity from our greed from our maliciousness from our hatred from our
[00:44:54.880 --> 00:44:59.760]   debased mind God saved us from that so when we see them that we don't get in
[00:44:59.760 --> 00:45:05.880]   this gear to fight up with them but to have compassion and mercy I don't know
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:12.680]   about you but the few homosexuals that I've come into count to contact with are
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:16.560]   broken and lonely people but they're broken and lonely because they're
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:22.800]   isolated from God you know I had a friend that I really respected about two
[00:45:22.800 --> 00:45:27.840]   months ago shared with me that his son came out to him confessed him that he
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:30.840]   had gay attraction that he'd been struggling with it and since junior high
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.160]   school and they asked him it's like so what happened he said he was going over
[00:45:36.160 --> 00:45:39.360]   to his friend's house and he got over at his friend's house and this is a pastor
[00:45:39.360 --> 00:45:44.060]   friend and it was his friend's house and and his friend started to watch
[00:45:44.060 --> 00:45:47.560]   pornography and so every time he go to his friend's house because he couldn't
[00:45:47.560 --> 00:45:51.000]   watch it at his home he would be exposed to pornography and then this exposure to
[00:45:51.000 --> 00:45:54.640]   pornography eventually got more heavy stuff and eventually when it got to more
[00:45:54.640 --> 00:45:59.680]   heavy stuff the the homosexual you know the pornography started opening up and
[00:45:59.680 --> 00:46:04.560]   eventually he got desensitized and that's how he described it and then that
[00:46:04.560 --> 00:46:07.920]   kind of stuck in and then he'd been wrestling with it inside and he wasn't
[00:46:07.920 --> 00:46:10.280]   saying he wasn't fighting with his dad saying like you know I want you to
[00:46:10.280 --> 00:46:16.520]   accept me he was just confessing how lonely he was and he asked me what
[00:46:16.520 --> 00:46:19.920]   should I do it's like I don't have a lot of experience in this but the few
[00:46:19.920 --> 00:46:25.160]   experiences that I did have is that the danger is there are plenty of wolves out
[00:46:25.160 --> 00:46:30.720]   there who are going to meet your son and they're gonna tell him it's okay that it
[00:46:30.720 --> 00:46:34.600]   is not God that's angry with them it's it's these fundamental Christians and
[00:46:34.600 --> 00:46:39.720]   they're gonna embrace them into their liberal church and he's gonna find love
[00:46:39.720 --> 00:46:42.640]   and acceptance in there and then once you get there it's hard to get him out
[00:46:42.640 --> 00:46:47.720]   so I instructed him make sure that he doesn't meet these people but the church
[00:46:47.720 --> 00:46:52.880]   that he's in that they make a strong stance that they don't compromise the
[00:46:52.880 --> 00:47:00.160]   Word of God and yet don't make him feel like that he's a freak because that sin
[00:47:00.160 --> 00:47:04.920]   is in all of us not maybe not the homosexual sin but the sexual perversion
[00:47:04.920 --> 00:47:10.800]   every single one of us was born with that that his struggle is the struggle
[00:47:10.800 --> 00:47:14.040]   that you and I have it just that it's expressed in that way and that he
[00:47:14.040 --> 00:47:18.320]   recognizes he's in a community of people who are struggling with different sexual
[00:47:18.320 --> 00:47:22.440]   perversions and that the grace of God will forgive him and just like it
[00:47:22.440 --> 00:47:26.800]   changed me it can change him and can change you so my encouragement to you I
[00:47:26.800 --> 00:47:31.320]   know we don't we didn't have time to go in through to this extensively but
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.980]   because it is a prevalent issue and it is an issue that I'm pretty sure that
[00:47:34.980 --> 00:47:38.560]   most of you if you're going to work or on campus that you've been faced with
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:45.720]   already that we don't err in compromise and we don't err in being insensitive
[00:47:45.720 --> 00:47:53.240]   that we take on the love of Christ the whole world is in need of grace the
[00:47:53.240 --> 00:47:58.280]   whole world and that you and I would take up that cross and go to people that
[00:47:58.280 --> 00:48:02.640]   are that we are uncomfortable with and tell them that we are not ashamed the
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:08.080]   gospel for it is a power of God unto salvation amen let's take a few minutes
[00:48:08.080 --> 00:48:15.520]   to pray and ask God if any of you here are struggling with this whether it's
[00:48:15.520 --> 00:48:21.640]   pornography or maybe even same-sex attraction you you know certain things
[00:48:21.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   have been embedded into your heart and your psyche and you've been struggling
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:29.000]   and wrestling with that I want to encourage you you have there is freedom
[00:48:29.000 --> 00:48:36.080]   in Christ there is freedom in Christ that if the gospel is just words and
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:41.000]   there really isn't any power we wouldn't be here the only reason why the church
[00:48:41.000 --> 00:48:45.960]   lasted as long as it is because he said my church I will build and the gates of
[00:48:45.960 --> 00:48:50.640]   Hades will not prevail against it and so I encourage you to come to the Lord come
[00:48:50.640 --> 00:48:56.200]   to us come to somebody a more mature Christian and confess that you may find
[00:48:56.200 --> 00:49:00.840]   this freedom that Christ delivers to that you may finally find this rest
[00:49:00.840 --> 00:49:05.920]   those of you who are wrestling and struggling again with pornography God
[00:49:05.920 --> 00:49:11.720]   forgives you think God is looking at you and saying oh you know what I'm so
[00:49:11.720 --> 00:49:16.680]   shocked by what this guy is doing or what she's doing you know our God is a
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:22.200]   sovereign God he came and died for us on the cross because he knew how weak we
[00:49:22.200 --> 00:49:27.920]   are without him you can't conquer this by yourself come to the throne of grace
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:34.160]   with confidence he is not shocked by your sins ask for forgiveness and
[00:49:34.160 --> 00:49:37.960]   receive forgiveness says if you confess your sins he is faithful and just to
[00:49:37.960 --> 00:49:42.240]   forgive you of all your unrighteousness so maybe you've been you've kind of
[00:49:42.240 --> 00:49:45.760]   justified and it's not it you know that maybe it's not okay maybe that's how
[00:49:45.760 --> 00:49:48.280]   you've been adjusting but in the deep part of your heart you know that that's
[00:49:48.280 --> 00:49:52.880]   not true I want to invite you to come and receive forgiveness and receive
[00:49:52.880 --> 00:49:58.000]   deliverance get together with other brothers and sisters pray be honest
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.720]   confess your sins with one another that as a community that we would become a
[00:50:01.720 --> 00:50:06.240]   community that we're not faking our righteousness that we're honestly openly
[00:50:06.240 --> 00:50:10.240]   humbly pursuing Christ together so let's take this time to come before the
[00:50:10.240 --> 00:50:14.720]   Lord in prayer either you or you know somebody was wrestling with with with
[00:50:14.720 --> 00:50:17.960]   these things that you would come before the Lord and ask for the Holy Spirit to
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:20.880]   do what only the Holy Spirit is able to do so let's take some time to pray
[00:50:20.880 --> 00:50:22.040]   before God.
