[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.180]   Okay, well, hello again, everyone.
[00:00:07.180 --> 00:00:11.920]   This is the last Sunday of the year, and there's nothing left now.
[00:00:11.920 --> 00:00:16.240]   Now that Christmas is done, we kind of start to look forward to New Year's Eve.
[00:00:16.240 --> 00:00:20.940]   So again, please join us this Friday as we reflect back on this past year and pray together,
[00:00:20.940 --> 00:00:25.680]   and also look forward to the coming year, as it'll be a good time to do that.
[00:00:25.680 --> 00:00:31.500]   And what I wanted to talk about today, after some meditation and contemplation on my end,
[00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.000]   is to talk about fear.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.240]   And it's because I actually gave the last Sunday sermon last year, too, and then I looked
[00:00:37.240 --> 00:00:42.860]   back at it, and I realized, man, like the landscape, I don't know, the landscape hasn't
[00:00:42.860 --> 00:00:45.000]   changed all that much.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.240]   And just looking and seeing and thinking about a good topic to think about and to kind of
[00:00:51.240 --> 00:00:55.640]   think together about as we end this year is on this topic of fear.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:00:56.640]   So we're going to be camping on this.
[00:00:56.640 --> 00:01:00.720]   I'm going to read out a list for you of things we might fear, because a lot of the work is
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.160]   going to be done in you as you listen, because I'm going to be talking about fear, but these
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:08.160]   fears need to be applied directly to us.
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.440]   And so we all come with very different fears.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:13.560]   Let me list a few.
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:20.440]   We have fear of people, fear of the unknown, fear of circumstances, fear of loneliness,
[00:01:20.440 --> 00:01:27.320]   fear of losing reputation, respect, fear of purposelessness, fear of pain, fear of rejection,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:29.240]   just to name a few.
[00:01:29.240 --> 00:01:34.240]   And the reason why I want to think about this is because fear is something that drives all
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:36.260]   of us, bar none.
[00:01:36.260 --> 00:01:40.560]   Every single one of us, fear will drive us.
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:44.720]   Whether you realize it or not, whether you understand that it's happening or not, fear
[00:01:44.720 --> 00:01:47.960]   is a driving force in all of us.
[00:01:47.960 --> 00:01:52.280]   It's something that's been happening in us all our lives, the last few years, the last
[00:01:52.280 --> 00:01:55.440]   few months, even the last few hours.
[00:01:55.440 --> 00:01:59.160]   Fear drives us.
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:05.560]   Wherever we have dreams, desires, hopes, or aspirations there, you're going to find fear.
[00:02:05.560 --> 00:02:08.480]   Fear is everywhere.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:12.560]   Fear of the unknown, therefore many times it's because we're afraid of our hopes being
[00:02:12.560 --> 00:02:18.760]   dashed, of our dreams and aspirations not coming into fruition.
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:21.680]   Fear is central in our decision making.
[00:02:21.680 --> 00:02:26.160]   Fear is central in our conviction, in our resolve.
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:32.680]   And fear, many times, because it's so consuming, is going to cause us to want to be rid of
[00:02:32.680 --> 00:02:34.560]   fear.
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:38.920]   But today, because fear has been such a great talking point over the last year, over the
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:47.120]   last couple years, today I want to take us down a very singular path, which is that we
[00:02:47.120 --> 00:02:50.320]   are not supposed to do away with fear.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.320]   And we were never meant to do away with fear.
[00:02:53.320 --> 00:02:59.080]   We were never meant to bring peace into our hearts by trying to overcome these fears that
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:00.080]   we see around us.
[00:03:00.080 --> 00:03:05.320]   In fact, the only way we're to overcome those things is to appropriately place our fear.
[00:03:05.320 --> 00:03:07.360]   And so that's what we're going to be talking about today.
[00:03:07.360 --> 00:03:14.880]   What it is to fear God, because this is not a new and unique idea for us.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:17.320]   So before we start, would you pray with me?
[00:03:17.320 --> 00:03:19.800]   Would you bow your heads with me?
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:25.840]   God, as we go into your word, I pray that we would hear and listen, obey and understand.
[00:03:25.840 --> 00:03:35.920]   Father, help us to come before you, before your word, God, that this is not a text removed
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:41.000]   from your very presence, from your very person.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.360]   Help us to respond not because we're at church listening to a sermon.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:48.320]   Help us to hear your voice.
[00:03:48.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:54.160]   We'll do five, five points today.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:56.160]   So we're going to kind of go through as fast as we can.
[00:03:56.160 --> 00:04:01.120]   The first one, the first point is that fear is completely wrapped up in what we worship.
[00:04:01.120 --> 00:04:05.560]   So we're going to equate the two things today, fear and worship.
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:10.780]   Fear is completely wrapped up in worship.
[00:04:10.780 --> 00:04:15.680]   Whatever it is that we deem to be the most important things in our lives, you will find
[00:04:15.680 --> 00:04:18.500]   fear there.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:21.760]   We fear that the object of our worship will be taken away from us.
[00:04:21.760 --> 00:04:24.400]   That's a very common experience for all of us.
[00:04:24.400 --> 00:04:31.320]   We see people doing crazy things because of the object of worship being threatened.
[00:04:31.320 --> 00:04:38.120]   People do crazy things in order to protect and to retain the object.
[00:04:38.120 --> 00:04:39.160]   There are lots of different things.
[00:04:39.160 --> 00:04:41.160]   One example could be a romantic relationship.
[00:04:41.160 --> 00:04:46.600]   I've seen people who are like somewhat mature in their faith and when it comes to this romantic
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.400]   sphere all of a sudden it seems like because of some kind of fear there, like they've done
[00:04:51.400 --> 00:04:52.760]   some crazy things.
[00:04:52.760 --> 00:04:54.920]   Like what did you say?
[00:04:54.920 --> 00:04:56.800]   What did you do?
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:04:58.800]   Why did you do that?
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.840]   Why did you move like that?
[00:04:59.840 --> 00:05:03.160]   Why did you make the decisions that you did?
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:11.120]   Because fears very much drive us as objects of worship come front and center.
[00:05:11.120 --> 00:05:16.440]   You see it in desire to uphold personal reputation, in the desire for prestige, comfort, some
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.320]   kind of title in our careers.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:22.200]   Another place that's interesting is when you see yourself angry.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.960]   Many times anger will reveal places of fear.
[00:05:25.960 --> 00:05:30.400]   We can't go into that one, but it's an interesting thing.
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:36.200]   We also fear that the power, we fear the power that the object of worship has over us.
[00:05:36.200 --> 00:05:40.720]   It can be an unhealthy fear and the wrath that can be poured out upon us.
[00:05:40.720 --> 00:05:43.640]   We fear that we might disappoint.
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:46.340]   This is one of the main reasons why we fear men.
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:47.360]   We fear people.
[00:05:47.360 --> 00:05:49.680]   We fear what people think about us.
[00:05:49.680 --> 00:05:53.360]   Even for people who pride themselves in saying, "I don't care what people think about me."
[00:05:53.360 --> 00:05:58.840]   You get close enough to their inner circles, the people that they care about, and there
[00:05:58.840 --> 00:06:02.240]   you will find many fears.
[00:06:02.240 --> 00:06:05.320]   Fear is completely wrapped up in what we worship.
[00:06:05.320 --> 00:06:08.320]   I want to make that link very clear today.
[00:06:08.320 --> 00:06:11.880]   Fear, worship.
[00:06:11.880 --> 00:06:18.040]   Where you see your greatest fears, there you will find your greatest places of worship.
[00:06:18.040 --> 00:06:24.600]   Therefore, that's where you'll find the greatest places of idolatry in your life.
[00:06:24.600 --> 00:06:29.680]   That's why generally we have this idea floating around in us of fearfulness.
[00:06:29.680 --> 00:06:33.840]   When we fear things, we know we're not supposed to fear the things of this world, what can
[00:06:33.840 --> 00:06:38.280]   be done to us, the losses that we might face, all that.
[00:06:38.280 --> 00:06:42.800]   We know singularly we're supposed to fear God and God alone.
[00:06:42.800 --> 00:06:50.120]   These are easy concepts for us, but we can see the great divide in the way we see things
[00:06:50.120 --> 00:06:51.400]   and understand things.
[00:06:51.400 --> 00:06:54.520]   We all know this.
[00:06:54.520 --> 00:07:01.400]   It's because God might not be the object of our worship.
[00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:05.160]   When we fear God, we don't fear anything else because we fear him.
[00:07:05.160 --> 00:07:08.360]   The fear of God is actually our foundation.
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:12.800]   The fear of God is the beginning point of everything we know, of everything we're supposed
[00:07:12.800 --> 00:07:15.260]   to be seeing.
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:20.520]   The fear of God is central point, is the hinge.
[00:07:20.520 --> 00:07:25.480]   In Proverbs 1, verse 7, it says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of knowledge."
[00:07:25.480 --> 00:07:29.160]   Now I want to highlight for you beginning.
[00:07:29.160 --> 00:07:34.920]   It doesn't say it is like a pinnacle or it doesn't say that it's great knowledge.
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.120]   If you have a fear of God, it leads to great knowledge or greater knowledge.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:42.160]   It says it is the beginning.
[00:07:42.160 --> 00:07:46.200]   It is the starting point.
[00:07:46.200 --> 00:07:48.280]   There's no shortcuts to this.
[00:07:48.280 --> 00:07:53.000]   You can't get to this idea of knowledge, you can't get to it unless you go through that
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:55.600]   door of fear of God.
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:56.720]   That's what this is saying.
[00:07:56.720 --> 00:08:01.560]   In Proverbs 9, 10, it says, "The fear of the Lord is the beginning of wisdom, and the knowledge
[00:08:01.560 --> 00:08:04.740]   of the Holy One is understanding."
[00:08:04.740 --> 00:08:08.280]   This means that if our decisions and sight do not begin with the fear of the Lord, there
[00:08:08.280 --> 00:08:13.400]   is no correct knowledge, there is no correct wisdom.
[00:08:13.400 --> 00:08:18.760]   These passages aren't saying that the fear of the Lord is just a good thing, something
[00:08:18.760 --> 00:08:20.760]   to work on.
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:24.680]   Again, look at it again, beginning.
[00:08:24.680 --> 00:08:28.940]   It's a foundation.
[00:08:28.940 --> 00:08:35.440]   Unless we see and think and start to have a worldview that is going through the fear
[00:08:35.440 --> 00:08:39.440]   of God, we're going to be on precarious ground.
[00:08:39.440 --> 00:08:43.840]   That's why when the winds and waves come in this world, when the things of our greatest
[00:08:43.840 --> 00:08:47.080]   fears come into fruition, what happens to us?
[00:08:47.080 --> 00:08:48.760]   We fall.
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.240]   Why?
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:53.000]   Because it depends on where our fears are.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:56.080]   It says here that the fear of God is that foundation.
[00:08:56.080 --> 00:08:57.960]   There is no middle ground.
[00:08:57.960 --> 00:09:03.360]   Because we were all made to be worshipers, we were all made to be fearers.
[00:09:03.360 --> 00:09:06.400]   We know that if we're not worshiping God, we're worshiping something else.
[00:09:06.400 --> 00:09:07.960]   Again, common thought.
[00:09:07.960 --> 00:09:12.360]   But that also means if we're not fearing God, we're fearing something else.
[00:09:12.360 --> 00:09:14.840]   There is no middle ground.
[00:09:14.840 --> 00:09:20.240]   I want to focus in the book of Luke to see this in action today, that people are encountering
[00:09:20.240 --> 00:09:21.240]   Jesus.
[00:09:21.240 --> 00:09:25.640]   It came to my thought in Christmas season, actually because last year I looked through
[00:09:25.640 --> 00:09:29.400]   it and there was one phrase I found interesting.
[00:09:29.400 --> 00:09:32.400]   It was Mary's prayer of worship to God.
[00:09:32.400 --> 00:09:39.640]   In that worship, she says that God's mercy is upon those who fear him.
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:44.000]   It's a very common, it's an inductive question you could easily ask.
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   Why fear?
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:46.840]   You could do that with mercy too.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:49.000]   I chose to think about the fear part.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:50.100]   Why fear?
[00:09:50.100 --> 00:09:56.100]   Why is it like that God's mercy is upon those who love God, who follow God, who trust in
[00:09:56.100 --> 00:09:57.100]   God?
[00:09:57.100 --> 00:09:58.100]   Why fear?
[00:09:58.100 --> 00:10:02.080]   Through that fascination, I started a word study through the book of Luke.
[00:10:02.080 --> 00:10:03.780]   That brings us to our second point here.
[00:10:03.780 --> 00:10:08.660]   In the book of Luke, what we see is that there is a common response to Jesus and that was
[00:10:08.660 --> 00:10:10.660]   fear.
[00:10:10.660 --> 00:10:13.460]   A common response to Jesus was fear.
[00:10:13.460 --> 00:10:20.620]   And now, be careful, because this makes too much sense to us.
[00:10:20.620 --> 00:10:24.940]   Of course, there ought to be some semblance of fear.
[00:10:24.940 --> 00:10:29.460]   But this is where I'm asking you, please don't jump the gap.
[00:10:29.460 --> 00:10:35.160]   When you see this great divide between, I know I ought to fear the Lord, and then how
[00:10:35.160 --> 00:10:40.440]   we're actually living, don't jump that too quick.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:45.120]   If this becomes a theological exercise of looking at Jesus saying, "Yeah, they're following
[00:10:45.120 --> 00:10:51.300]   before Jesus, makes sense," without stopping and seeing what's going on, it's going to
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:53.460]   leave us in a dangerous place.
[00:10:53.460 --> 00:10:56.860]   What I saw as I was going through the book of Luke is that person after person in Calvary
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:10:58.580]   and Tunisia, Jesus was afraid.
[00:10:58.580 --> 00:11:00.140]   Very weird.
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:07.780]   Again, kind of makes sense on my understanding level, but when I start to sit there and think,
[00:11:07.780 --> 00:11:14.460]   how would I have responded when Jesus is doing crazy things, when he's doing these miracles,
[00:11:14.460 --> 00:11:18.980]   when this net comes up with wiggling fish and is threatening to break?
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.860]   I think I would have responded, this is just what I think, right?
[00:11:22.860 --> 00:11:25.380]   I don't know if my first thing would have been fear.
[00:11:25.380 --> 00:11:27.980]   If I'm trying to place myself there, I think my first thing would have been some kind of
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:28.980]   exuberance.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:32.660]   Like, "Whoa, dude!"
[00:11:32.660 --> 00:11:35.300]   I think a smile would have been brought to my face.
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:37.940]   I would have been like, "Dude, I'm going with this guy.
[00:11:37.940 --> 00:11:40.180]   This man, I'm going to follow him."
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:41.180]   I might have done the same thing.
[00:11:41.180 --> 00:11:43.100]   I would have left everything to follow this man.
[00:11:43.100 --> 00:11:49.900]   It would have been this response of joy, of happiness, something like that.
[00:11:49.900 --> 00:11:53.660]   But here, the passages that I saw was fear.
[00:11:53.660 --> 00:11:55.820]   That was the immediate response.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.740]   Okay, let's go through it.
[00:11:59.740 --> 00:12:02.980]   In the beginning when Jesus is being talked about, it made more sense.
[00:12:02.980 --> 00:12:07.560]   In Luke 1, verse 12, it says, "Zechariah was troubled when he saw the angel, and fear
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:08.560]   gripped him."
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.580]   Okay, so here's an angel of light, and that made sense.
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:12.700]   That's kind of scary.
[00:12:12.700 --> 00:12:18.060]   And then in Luke 1, 65, it says, "Zechariah opening his mouth, fear came on all those
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:21.220]   living around them, and all these matters were being talked about in all the hill country
[00:12:21.220 --> 00:12:22.220]   of Judea."
[00:12:22.220 --> 00:12:26.620]   Now remember, Gabriel was, you can think of him as like a pointer, right?
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:28.900]   He's pointing to the coming Christ.
[00:12:28.900 --> 00:12:32.980]   And so, well, the person who points to someone that's coming is supposed to be lesser than
[00:12:32.980 --> 00:12:33.980]   the one that's coming.
[00:12:33.980 --> 00:12:38.340]   But there's appropriate fear that is given upon this angel who's pointing to the coming
[00:12:38.340 --> 00:12:39.980]   of Jesus.
[00:12:39.980 --> 00:12:45.540]   And then Jesus comes into the picture, and then in Luke 5, verse 8 through 10, it's a
[00:12:45.540 --> 00:12:48.060]   story of Simon Peter.
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:53.560]   Jesus tells, remember he's a carpenter, tells a seasoned fisherman, along with a couple
[00:12:53.560 --> 00:13:00.340]   other seasoned fishermen, what to do in the water in order to catch fish.
[00:13:00.340 --> 00:13:05.380]   And they listen, and this net comes up full of wiggling fish, and look at what happens
[00:13:05.380 --> 00:13:06.900]   as a response, Luke 5, 8.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:14.780]   "But when Simon Peter saw that, he fell down at Jesus' feet."
[00:13:14.780 --> 00:13:18.080]   Now, listen to his words.
[00:13:18.080 --> 00:13:22.740]   This was his first and immediate reaction.
[00:13:22.740 --> 00:13:26.060]   I think this is like all he felt.
[00:13:26.060 --> 00:13:32.660]   When you look at it, he says, "Go away from me, Lord, for I am a sinful man.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:40.420]   For amazement," I love this word, "had seized him and all his companions because of the
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:42.440]   catch of fish which they had taken.
[00:13:42.440 --> 00:13:45.140]   And so also were James and John, sons of Zebedee, who were partners with Simon."
[00:13:45.140 --> 00:13:46.560]   Look at that word, "because."
[00:13:46.560 --> 00:13:53.020]   Because of the fish they had caught, why would fear happen?
[00:13:53.020 --> 00:13:58.940]   Why not exuberance and joy and happiness and excitement?
[00:13:58.940 --> 00:14:05.020]   Why does he fall down?
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:10.420]   What we're seeing here is the difference between knowing, right?
[00:14:10.420 --> 00:14:12.880]   Maybe he was like, "This is the Messiah."
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:15.000]   Maybe something like that was going on in his mind, right?
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:16.780]   It's all in here.
[00:14:16.780 --> 00:14:25.860]   But this is what happens when you experience it, when you're in the presence.
[00:14:25.860 --> 00:14:27.820]   Luke 5:26, Jesus and the paralytic.
[00:14:27.820 --> 00:14:29.820]   Remember, this is a paralyzed man.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:33.560]   And all of a sudden, he's walking.
[00:14:33.560 --> 00:14:35.060]   How would you have responded in that situation?
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:36.860]   There's a paralyzed man here.
[00:14:36.860 --> 00:14:41.660]   Jesus comes and says, "Walk," and he gets up and he walks.
[00:14:41.660 --> 00:14:42.980]   What would your response have been?
[00:14:42.980 --> 00:14:47.360]   But look at Luke 5:26, "They were all struck with astonishment and began glorifying God,
[00:14:47.360 --> 00:14:48.580]   and they were filled."
[00:14:48.580 --> 00:14:49.800]   It doesn't say they were fearful.
[00:14:49.800 --> 00:14:55.900]   They were filled with fear, afraid, scared.
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:57.780]   We have seen remarkable things today.
[00:14:57.780 --> 00:15:00.700]   Luke 7:16, Jesus heals the centurion's servant.
[00:15:00.700 --> 00:15:05.780]   Fear gripped them, and they began glorifying God, saying, "A great prophet has risen among
[00:15:05.780 --> 00:15:07.860]   us, and God has visited his people."
[00:15:07.860 --> 00:15:12.200]   When Jesus calms the storm, Luke 8:25, "And he said to them, 'Where is your faith?'
[00:15:12.200 --> 00:15:15.980]   They were fearful and amazed, saying to one another, 'Who then is this, that he commands
[00:15:15.980 --> 00:15:18.060]   even the winds and the water, and they obey him?'"
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.340]   Jesus and the demoniac, Luke 8:35, "The people went out to see what had happened, and they
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.420]   had came to Jesus and found the man from whom the demons had gone out, sitting down at the
[00:15:26.420 --> 00:15:29.300]   feet of Jesus, clothed and in his right mind, and they became frightened."
[00:15:29.300 --> 00:15:34.340]   This is my favorite one, because you would think that someone is afraid of a demon-possessed
[00:15:34.340 --> 00:15:35.340]   man, right?
[00:15:35.340 --> 00:15:38.000]   If you came across a demon-possessed man, think of the fear.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.460]   These people are afraid because the demon-possessed man became normal.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:44.280]   Do you see that?
[00:15:44.280 --> 00:15:48.320]   They're filled with fear because he's thinking and talking properly.
[00:15:48.320 --> 00:15:49.320]   He's clothed.
[00:15:49.320 --> 00:15:51.100]   They're like, "What happened to him?"
[00:15:51.100 --> 00:15:53.980]   And it's not like, "Whoa, Jesus!"
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:59.040]   It's fear.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:02.940]   In Luke 8:37, to conclude that story, "And all the people of the country of the Gerasenes
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:05.440]   and the surrounding district asked him to leave.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:09.640]   They were so afraid to ask him to leave, for they were gripped with great fear."
[00:16:09.640 --> 00:16:13.840]   And there's a lot of big language going on there.
[00:16:13.840 --> 00:16:16.280]   Gripped with great fear.
[00:16:16.280 --> 00:16:17.760]   They got into a boat, and he returned.
[00:16:17.760 --> 00:16:21.720]   "Jesus and the bleeding woman," Luke 8:47, "When the woman saw that she had not escaped
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:26.720]   notice, she came trembling and fell down before him, and declared in the presence of all the
[00:16:26.720 --> 00:16:30.420]   people the reason why she had touched him and how she had been immediately healed.
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.760]   When Jesus resurrects the little girl," Luke 8:56, "her parents were amazed by the way
[00:16:34.760 --> 00:16:39.760]   this word amazed has a type of fear imbued into it, but he instructed them to tell no
[00:16:39.760 --> 00:16:41.080]   one what had happened.
[00:16:41.080 --> 00:16:45.080]   Jesus and the transfiguration," Luke 9:34, "While he was saying this, a cloud formed
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:50.240]   and began to overshadow them, and the three, they were afraid as they entered the cloud.
[00:16:50.240 --> 00:16:55.320]   And Jesus appears after the resurrection," Luke 24:37, "but they were startled and frightened
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:56.880]   and thought they were seeing a spirit."
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:17:03.040]   Now, regardless of the story here, this was just a cursory read through the book of Luke.
[00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:05.760]   The immediate response was fear.
[00:17:05.760 --> 00:17:12.320]   It was like, I'm like, "Why didn't I not see this?"
[00:17:12.320 --> 00:17:14.640]   Everybody.
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:19.200]   See, fear is natural to the human.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:22.480]   We were made to be fearers.
[00:17:22.480 --> 00:17:26.600]   As much as we were all created to worship, it goes hand in hand with fear.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:31.560]   Fear is an appropriate response for every human being.
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:32.560]   That's what we do.
[00:17:32.560 --> 00:17:37.720]   Now, we just saw encounters with Jesus, but that's what we do as human.
[00:17:37.720 --> 00:17:40.240]   We fear things.
[00:17:40.240 --> 00:17:48.680]   Today, we've grown much too casual with the Lord.
[00:17:48.680 --> 00:17:51.480]   We say we want to glorify God.
[00:17:51.480 --> 00:17:54.000]   We want God to be glorified.
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:01.320]   We say we are worshipers of God, and we're proud Bereans here.
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:11.680]   We say our vision is engaging in God-centered worship.
[00:18:11.680 --> 00:18:15.760]   But there is danger here.
[00:18:15.760 --> 00:18:23.960]   If we say this casually, flippantly, when there is actually no fear in us of God, it
[00:18:23.960 --> 00:18:26.040]   shows something about us.
[00:18:26.040 --> 00:18:30.120]   When we have no fear of the Lord in us, we have to question if we actually currently
[00:18:30.120 --> 00:18:34.760]   believe what we're saying.
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:39.020]   We have to wonder about the quality of our worship.
[00:18:39.020 --> 00:18:44.640]   We have to think, "Do I actually believe these things about God?"
[00:18:44.640 --> 00:18:49.880]   Because if we're not careful, then we are going to fall simply into Christian ways of
[00:18:49.880 --> 00:18:56.040]   living, habitually drawing out our action based upon Christian moralism, and trying
[00:18:56.040 --> 00:19:01.400]   to follow sets of rules that we've established, and be able to say the right things with our
[00:19:01.400 --> 00:19:06.320]   mouth that we are worshipers of God, who engage in God-centered worship, that we have a high
[00:19:06.320 --> 00:19:12.920]   view of God, and then the way we live does not reflect it.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:19.080]   It's a theological concept to me.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:26.360]   Is the experience there for every one of us?
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:30.840]   Albert Martin says, "One of the accurate measurements of true spiritual growth is the measure to
[00:19:30.840 --> 00:19:36.080]   which one increases in walking in the fear of God."
[00:19:36.080 --> 00:19:38.080]   Let's take one example from Hebrews 4.16.
[00:19:38.080 --> 00:19:42.020]   Hebrews 4.16 says, "Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace
[00:19:42.020 --> 00:19:46.840]   so that we may receive mercy and find grace to help in time of need."
[00:19:46.840 --> 00:19:55.160]   We know this passage, one of my favorite passages, but I want us to take a look at it to show
[00:19:55.160 --> 00:20:07.000]   how quickly, how quickly we move to just this understanding that we have instead of experience.
[00:20:07.000 --> 00:20:11.480]   This is so challenging to me.
[00:20:11.480 --> 00:20:18.520]   When you look at this passage, what's the word that we highlight almost every time?
[00:20:18.520 --> 00:20:24.120]   I think, if I'm wrong, sorry, I think it's confidence.
[00:20:24.120 --> 00:20:25.760]   That's what I kind of think.
[00:20:25.760 --> 00:20:29.400]   Approach the throne of grace with confidence.
[00:20:29.400 --> 00:20:32.520]   Here's the problem with that.
[00:20:32.520 --> 00:20:39.360]   Why is he telling you to approach the throne of grace with confidence?
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:44.240]   Because you're approaching the throne, right?
[00:20:44.240 --> 00:20:49.440]   The reason why he's telling us to approach the throne of grace with confidence is because
[00:20:49.440 --> 00:20:55.440]   the reaction ought to be foundationally fearful.
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:21:00.680]   People use this image of a child who's in the president's office, and then he strolls
[00:21:00.680 --> 00:21:01.680]   in comfortably.
[00:21:01.680 --> 00:21:02.680]   Why?
[00:21:02.680 --> 00:21:03.680]   Because the president is his father.
[00:21:03.680 --> 00:21:06.000]   You might have heard that image before.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:11.640]   I think it's true, and it's a good image, but not without the appropriateness of the
[00:21:11.640 --> 00:21:15.000]   foundation that ought to be set.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:22.080]   That we run to this confidence word, that we can go up to this God without realizing
[00:21:22.080 --> 00:21:24.320]   the weight of what it's saying.
[00:21:24.320 --> 00:21:30.840]   He's saying, "You're going to God."
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:40.640]   How can he say, "Approach him confidently," like ever?
[00:21:40.640 --> 00:21:43.800]   Isn't it kind of weird?
[00:21:43.800 --> 00:21:48.480]   He's saying, "Approach the throne of grace in confidence to find help in your time of
[00:21:48.480 --> 00:21:50.800]   need."
[00:21:50.800 --> 00:21:54.240]   Because what the author of Hebrews is saying is the foundation is fear.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:55.440]   It's understood.
[00:21:55.440 --> 00:21:58.100]   This is not just a worldly throne, even.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:06.620]   This is the king of the universe, and he says, "Approach the throne."
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:14.500]   What amazing capacity we humans have to decrease the Lord.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:19.860]   What amazing is the human capacity when John the Baptist has to say something like, "He
[00:22:19.860 --> 00:22:23.060]   must increase, and I must decrease," and we're challenged by it.
[00:22:23.060 --> 00:22:27.820]   How sad that we're challenged by that statement.
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:31.100]   He must increase, and I must decrease?
[00:22:31.100 --> 00:22:32.980]   Oh, man.
[00:22:32.980 --> 00:22:39.900]   That's so challenging to me, and it's so sad that I'm challenged by that.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:44.220]   How does one even increase God?
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:49.740]   Last week, Pastor Peter, he showed the magnitude of God by scrolling out.
[00:22:49.740 --> 00:22:52.060]   We're this minute little person.
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:58.420]   We're a speck, even when it comes to just an aerial perspective of our state of California.
[00:22:58.420 --> 00:23:03.140]   You zoom out to country and to planet, and you keep going on, and you realize, man, the
[00:23:03.140 --> 00:23:08.220]   planet to the sun, the sun to the stars, and the stars, there's so many of these stars
[00:23:08.220 --> 00:23:10.860]   in this galaxy, and there are billions of galaxies.
[00:23:10.860 --> 00:23:16.980]   You go out and out and out, and you realize that the Bible says that God holds the universe
[00:23:16.980 --> 00:23:19.020]   in his hands.
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:23.500]   He's huge.
[00:23:23.500 --> 00:23:30.500]   We should just stop talking, because there's no way our words can communicate the grandeur,
[00:23:30.500 --> 00:23:33.860]   the magnificence, the hugeness, the immensity of our God.
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:34.860]   There's no way.
[00:23:34.860 --> 00:23:37.540]   So we just say, "He's huge."
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:47.020]   And for John the Baptist to say, "He must increase," is an absurdity.
[00:23:47.020 --> 00:23:55.420]   This isn't a ... The concept is not crazy, is we get it.
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:00.680]   But it happens because we've somehow lost sight of God's actual magnitude.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:08.020]   He does not need to be magnified.
[00:24:08.020 --> 00:24:12.960]   He is who he is.
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:18.900]   His magnitude is a reality, is a truth that never changes.
[00:24:18.900 --> 00:24:22.260]   It's a staggering reality.
[00:24:22.260 --> 00:24:24.300]   His magnitude is incomprehensible.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:25.620]   We're the problem.
[00:24:25.620 --> 00:24:28.700]   And not only does he say, "He must increase," what else does he say?
[00:24:28.700 --> 00:24:31.620]   Oh, man, we're such fools, right?
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:37.540]   He says, "You must decrease."
[00:24:37.540 --> 00:24:44.360]   Why does he say, "You have to decrease," because we're so big in our own eyes?
[00:24:44.360 --> 00:24:51.040]   We look at this image of the suns and the stars, and we know right in here, I'm small.
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.360]   I'm infinitesimally small.
[00:24:53.360 --> 00:24:54.880]   I'm a speck.
[00:24:54.880 --> 00:24:56.040]   God is huge.
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.200]   God is big.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.320]   God is everything.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:04.680]   He is God alone, all in here.
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:10.740]   That's why we need to coach ourself and convince ourself on these very seats before we sing
[00:25:10.740 --> 00:25:16.660]   these worship songs to this great God to say, "Remember, remember, we have to pull ourselves.
[00:25:16.660 --> 00:25:18.340]   Remember reverence.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:20.260]   Remember awe.
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.260]   Remember worship."
[00:25:21.260 --> 00:25:29.800]   Because he somehow decreased, and somehow I have increased.
[00:25:29.800 --> 00:25:31.000]   What an absurdity.
[00:25:31.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   The reason why John the Baptist says this is because, do you know why?
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   Because I'm dumb.
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:37.560]   It's because I'm blind.
[00:25:37.560 --> 00:25:40.160]   Because I don't understand.
[00:25:40.160 --> 00:25:42.880]   I'm a fool.
[00:25:42.880 --> 00:25:44.440]   I have no fear of God in me.
[00:25:44.440 --> 00:25:54.320]   I have no grasp and understanding of present day reality.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:57.480]   We wake up every morning thinking, "I'm God.
[00:25:57.480 --> 00:25:59.840]   The world revolves around me.
[00:25:59.840 --> 00:26:04.560]   It's my wishes, my desires, which is all that matters.
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.860]   When someone wrongs me, I will retaliate.
[00:26:06.860 --> 00:26:10.540]   When something doesn't go my way, I will complain.
[00:26:10.540 --> 00:26:14.360]   When troubles come, I will blame others and even God himself."
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.720]   That's because we fear the things of the world.
[00:26:16.720 --> 00:26:19.720]   When the things of the world threaten us, guess what?
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:26.240]   We think we're God, but in reality we realize we have no power of God.
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:28.200]   When things threaten us, what happens?
[00:26:28.200 --> 00:26:35.560]   The fear of these things begin to shake us.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.080]   Because these things, I'm so afraid to lose these things because it's going against what
[00:26:40.080 --> 00:26:42.000]   I've created to be my kingdom.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.800]   It's going against my desires, my wishes, my aspirations, my hopes, whatever it is that
[00:26:46.800 --> 00:26:58.960]   my plans are, that those things I've set up and they have become idols in my life.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:02.200]   We can't sit there and mentally convince ourselves that God is someone to be feared because we
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:07.720]   already know it.
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:12.640]   Isn't true fear something that needs to be experienced?
[00:27:12.640 --> 00:27:16.400]   I'm very afraid of heights.
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:18.320]   I hate the feeling of heights.
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:24.360]   Go up, I don't care how high it is, anything past two stories I start getting really like
[00:27:24.360 --> 00:27:25.360]   ehh.
[00:27:25.360 --> 00:27:26.360]   It makes my legs feel like jello.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:27.960]   I don't like what it does.
[00:27:27.960 --> 00:27:29.720]   It makes my stomach feel a little queasy.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:32.280]   I don't like heights.
[00:27:32.280 --> 00:27:35.880]   Whenever I go up into heights places, I just pretend that's not there.
[00:27:35.880 --> 00:27:38.040]   That's why I overcome my fear of heights.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:39.040]   Here's the thing.
[00:27:39.040 --> 00:27:42.360]   The weird thing about people who fear things, you like thinking about it or you like imagining
[00:27:42.360 --> 00:27:43.560]   things.
[00:27:43.560 --> 00:27:47.960]   What I like to do, actually my wife thinks I'm so odd for doing this, but I like YouTube
[00:27:47.960 --> 00:27:50.080]   videos of heights.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:54.280]   So people go up to these high places and look down and look and I go, "Ahh!"
[00:27:54.280 --> 00:27:56.280]   I do that, right?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:28:00.600]   Please, get away from that ledge.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:06.320]   I don't care how many inches of plastic there is there, get off.
[00:28:06.320 --> 00:28:09.280]   Clip yourself onto something.
[00:28:09.280 --> 00:28:10.280]   I mean it's just there.
[00:28:10.280 --> 00:28:12.320]   But, do you know what I look like?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:15.440]   If my wife were to explain to you what I look like at that place, I would probably have
[00:28:15.440 --> 00:28:18.520]   a smile on my face going like.
[00:28:18.520 --> 00:28:27.120]   But, okay, here's the difference with just thinking, contemplating, meditating on fear
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.360]   and me actually going to a place where I'm like thousands of feet up.
[00:28:32.360 --> 00:28:33.360]   I can't do things.
[00:28:33.360 --> 00:28:34.600]   Is that a thing?
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:40.800]   Thousands of feet up in the air and I'm looking down and that fear that grips me, that reality
[00:28:40.800 --> 00:28:42.760]   that I see before me, you know what happens?
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:45.200]   There is no smile.
[00:28:45.200 --> 00:28:47.280]   There is no thrill.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.080]   There is only fear.
[00:28:50.080 --> 00:28:53.560]   I'm terrified.
[00:28:53.560 --> 00:28:56.080]   All I can think about is, get me away.
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   Right?
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:59.600]   Do you guys know what I'm saying?
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:05.720]   The difference between this and then when you're there, when you experience something.
[00:29:05.720 --> 00:29:13.880]   For every parent, every parent, this happened at the OC fair a while back.
[00:29:13.880 --> 00:29:15.560]   One of the parents lost her kids.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.600]   I was like, "Oh my gosh, how could you lose your kids?"
[00:29:17.600 --> 00:29:20.240]   And I turn around, we lost our kid.
[00:29:20.240 --> 00:29:25.340]   And so, I'm sitting there thinking about this and there's differences because as a parent
[00:29:25.340 --> 00:29:29.720]   of three young kids, we've all done it, right?
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.560]   What would we do if this happened?
[00:29:32.560 --> 00:29:37.320]   But whatever the case, that feeling of fear, you watch these movies where the kid disappears,
[00:29:37.320 --> 00:29:41.200]   you're like, "It catches your breath."
[00:29:41.200 --> 00:29:47.000]   But that moment when we couldn't find our child, even though it was a split, like maybe
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:53.160]   it was like 20 or 30 seconds, that moment, sheer terror.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.800]   Just panic.
[00:29:55.800 --> 00:29:59.280]   Like, I do not know what to do.
[00:29:59.280 --> 00:30:00.280]   Inside, it was like, "Slow down.
[00:30:00.280 --> 00:30:01.960]   Okay, this is what you got to do."
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.640]   And all that kind of stuff, but the feeling was gripping.
[00:30:06.640 --> 00:30:09.200]   The experience was just something.
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:12.160]   And I think we understand this.
[00:30:12.160 --> 00:30:19.280]   We get it when we feel these things.
[00:30:19.280 --> 00:30:22.280]   Our fears are going to reveal something about us.
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:25.360]   It's going to reveal the greatest places of worship in us.
[00:30:25.360 --> 00:30:32.280]   And it's going to be many times, honestly, experiential.
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.800]   So my question to you is, have you been cultivating a fear of the Lord?
[00:30:35.800 --> 00:30:37.640]   There's no shortcut in this.
[00:30:37.640 --> 00:30:44.400]   There's no way for you to say, like, "I have to fear God more."
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:47.920]   That was what was happening to these people that we saw in Luke.
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:51.480]   It was experiential.
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:31:00.160]   They're coming across Christ, and then in his presence, experience happens.
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:01.160]   That's why they fall.
[00:31:01.160 --> 00:31:02.160]   Right?
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:09.040]   I mean, do you understand, like, why the experience is so important in this?
[00:31:09.040 --> 00:31:12.280]   When we think of the things we fear in the world, again, they could be bodily harm or
[00:31:12.280 --> 00:31:17.880]   death, lots of financial security, loss of relationships, disapproval of man, loss of
[00:31:17.880 --> 00:31:23.720]   reputation, having our aspirations ripped away from us, drawing near to the Lord, walking
[00:31:23.720 --> 00:31:29.880]   with him, seeing him, ought to cast off all other fears.
[00:31:29.880 --> 00:31:33.880]   We understand that.
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:39.600]   As our fear of him grows, our rightly high and view of God, as that grows in us, it's
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:43.720]   going to transform our hearts in this.
[00:31:43.720 --> 00:31:48.880]   For Simon Peter, it caused him to turn his back on his entire career.
[00:31:48.880 --> 00:31:54.000]   For James and John, it left their father and a lucrative business and a boat behind.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:58.360]   For Matthew, the tax collector, he left behind his identity, his friends, his riches, his
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:02.600]   security, everything that he knew, it left everything behind.
[00:32:02.600 --> 00:32:06.560]   For all of these disciples, it left behind fear of the loss of these things.
[00:32:06.560 --> 00:32:09.160]   Now, here's my question.
[00:32:09.160 --> 00:32:10.920]   Why?
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:11.920]   Because they weren't afraid?
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:14.120]   Can I tell you?
[00:32:14.120 --> 00:32:15.120]   No.
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:22.240]   I don't think it was that fears that went away, here, I think they were still afraid.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:29.240]   You know, most of the original apostles, they were martyred, they were executed.
[00:32:29.240 --> 00:32:33.160]   Do you think that they were without fear the night before they died?
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:37.920]   You know, I think about it and I think, no, I think they were afraid.
[00:32:37.920 --> 00:32:41.640]   It's scary.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:42.640]   What happened to them?
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:51.240]   Well, in a place where we're all called to be fears, a greater fear consumed them.
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:56.640]   The greatest and only logical object of worship replaced their entire viewfinder.
[00:32:56.640 --> 00:33:03.220]   Their sight got completely saturated with God.
[00:33:03.220 --> 00:33:07.480]   It changed their entire paradigm for that reason.
[00:33:07.480 --> 00:33:13.600]   It was a fear so powerful that it obliterated all of their fears.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:15.760]   It changed their dreams, even.
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:17.520]   What a powerful fear.
[00:33:17.520 --> 00:33:24.040]   It changed their dreams, their aspirations, their hopes, and their desires.
[00:33:24.040 --> 00:33:29.480]   It led most of them to death.
[00:33:29.480 --> 00:33:35.460]   What fears today have been overcoming your fear of the Lord?
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:38.920]   Are we people who have been cultivating a fear of the Lord that overcomes all other
[00:33:38.920 --> 00:33:39.920]   fears?
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:47.320]   Now, the third point today is that in the book of Luke, Jesus commands them not to fear.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.080]   I thought this was really funny as I was thinking about this.
[00:33:51.080 --> 00:33:55.480]   Our second point was that the response, the common response to Jesus is to fear.
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:59.200]   In the book of Luke, you're like, "Man, I need to fear God."
[00:33:59.200 --> 00:34:02.920]   Over and over again, in the middle of it, the things that's all interspersed is, "Do
[00:34:02.920 --> 00:34:03.920]   not fear.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:04.920]   Do not fear.
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:06.400]   You're jerking me around here.
[00:34:06.400 --> 00:34:09.920]   Am I to fear or am I to not fear?"
[00:34:09.920 --> 00:34:14.200]   Then I realized, "If I'm not careful with this, I will choose what I want, when I want
[00:34:14.200 --> 00:34:15.200]   in my life.
[00:34:15.200 --> 00:34:18.640]   I know I'm supposed to fear, so I'll try to develop a fear.
[00:34:18.640 --> 00:34:21.600]   When I feel afraid of these things, I'll try not to fear."
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:24.240]   There's the disconnect that can happen there.
[00:34:24.240 --> 00:34:25.240]   Let's look.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.360]   In the book of Luke, there's a command over and over again.
[00:34:27.360 --> 00:34:31.440]   Luke 1:13, "But the angel said to him, 'Do not be afraid, Zacharias, for your petition
[00:34:31.440 --> 00:34:35.080]   has been heard, and your wife Elizabeth will bear you a son, and you will give him the
[00:34:35.080 --> 00:34:36.080]   name John.'"
[00:34:36.080 --> 00:34:40.720]   Then, later on, in Luke 1:30, "The angel said to her, 'Do not be afraid, Mary, for you have
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.640]   found favor with God.'"
[00:34:42.640 --> 00:34:49.280]   Then in Zacharias' prophecy, Luke 1:74, "To grant us that we, being rescued from the hand
[00:34:49.280 --> 00:34:52.760]   of our enemies, might serve him without fear."
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:56.040]   The angels come to the shepherds and says, "This is scary.
[00:34:56.040 --> 00:34:57.440]   A bunch of angels come."
[00:34:57.440 --> 00:35:00.920]   But the angel said to them, "Do not be afraid, for behold, I bring you good news."
[00:35:00.920 --> 00:35:05.920]   Luke 5:10, this is the story with Simon Peter and the fish in the net.
[00:35:05.920 --> 00:35:10.240]   Jesus says, and Simon's scared, "Jesus said to Simon, 'Do not fear.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.600]   From now on, you will be catching men.'"
[00:35:11.600 --> 00:35:15.040]   In Luke 12:4, he says, "I say to you, my friends, do not be afraid of those who kill the body
[00:35:15.040 --> 00:35:19.720]   after, and after that have no more that they can do."
[00:35:19.720 --> 00:35:23.240]   The fear is essential before comfort can come.
[00:35:23.240 --> 00:35:27.000]   Before God's peace is offered to us, there is actually fear in us.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:30.960]   So this is what it means.
[00:35:30.960 --> 00:35:37.000]   Fear of God will lead us to a place where he says, "Do not fear," which is going to
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.640]   lead us into a place of comfort.
[00:35:39.640 --> 00:35:43.160]   That's how it works in every situation.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:46.840]   Fear of God, he says, "Don't be afraid."
[00:35:46.840 --> 00:35:49.000]   And then peace and comfort comes.
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:55.520]   Now what we do, because of the disconnect, because we know things, because we know about
[00:35:55.520 --> 00:36:04.920]   who God is, so we're able to say, "Sovereign, good, omnipotent, omniscient."
[00:36:04.920 --> 00:36:06.960]   We know these things, right?
[00:36:06.960 --> 00:36:10.720]   So we say to each other, "Trust God, trust God, trust God."
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:17.000]   Convince ourselves, "Trust God, trust God," without the experience.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   And we lose it.
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:19.640]   So this is what we do.
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:23.240]   We come to places where we fear, because we're fearers.
[00:36:23.240 --> 00:36:25.120]   We fear so many things.
[00:36:25.120 --> 00:36:31.760]   And we come to these little junctions or these crossroads, and with the fear, we want peace.
[00:36:31.760 --> 00:36:32.760]   That's natural.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:34.200]   We want comfort.
[00:36:34.200 --> 00:36:41.280]   And so we go to God's word, and we try to take, and we try to go like, "Ngh," to our
[00:36:41.280 --> 00:36:43.140]   minds.
[00:36:43.140 --> 00:36:49.320]   Do you know why two of the passages that I have most readily memorized in my brain is
[00:36:49.320 --> 00:36:51.640]   Proverbs?
[00:36:51.640 --> 00:36:55.200]   Because when we think about these passages that we remember in our brain, like, "Trust
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:36:56.200]   in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:36:56.200 --> 00:36:57.200]   Do not lean on your own understanding."
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:37:05.720]   We kind of go, and we say these things over and over and over again in our minds.
[00:37:05.720 --> 00:37:09.440]   Do not be anxious about anything but in everything by prayer and supplication.
[00:37:09.440 --> 00:37:14.560]   It's because we desire the peace of God to come and envelop us, right?
[00:37:14.560 --> 00:37:15.560]   Is that not what we do?
[00:37:15.560 --> 00:37:20.100]   We go to God, and we go to his word, because we want the peace.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:23.460]   We want the peace in pillow form.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:29.720]   We want that thing to be zapped into us, and we pray to our peers, and we say to our peers,
[00:37:29.720 --> 00:37:31.560]   "Please pray for me.
[00:37:31.560 --> 00:37:34.080]   Pray that I'll have God's peace."
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:36.760]   And we do whatever we can to get it.
[00:37:36.760 --> 00:37:38.480]   And there are certain prayer requests that drive me crazy.
[00:37:38.480 --> 00:37:43.200]   Like, when we say, "Pray that I won't be lazy," it just makes no sense to me.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.640]   Sometimes I go like, "Okay, I'll pray for you," and then in my mind I'm thinking, "Don't
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:48.640]   be lazy."
[00:37:48.640 --> 00:37:53.800]   In a similar way, people say, "Please pray that God's peace will be with me."
[00:37:53.800 --> 00:37:56.240]   Like, don't worry, I'm not judging you as you're saying that.
[00:37:56.240 --> 00:37:57.680]   It's a good prayer.
[00:37:57.680 --> 00:37:58.960]   But there is something about it in my mind.
[00:37:58.960 --> 00:38:02.040]   I think like, "But are you walking with the Lord?"
[00:38:02.040 --> 00:38:04.960]   Because we all want that peace and comfort.
[00:38:04.960 --> 00:38:08.720]   There's difficulties that come, fears that we face, and we want those things, and we
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:11.760]   want to jam it into us with no experience of God.
[00:38:11.760 --> 00:38:13.320]   There is no encounter with him.
[00:38:13.320 --> 00:38:15.040]   There is no everyday walking with him.
[00:38:15.040 --> 00:38:16.420]   There's no abiding with him.
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:18.640]   There's no desire to be in his presence.
[00:38:18.640 --> 00:38:22.620]   We only want the effects of what God could give us.
[00:38:22.620 --> 00:38:25.760]   And so what we do is we have all this knowledge of who God is.
[00:38:25.760 --> 00:38:30.740]   So even the right theology, misapplied, is going to be because we are not effectively
[00:38:30.740 --> 00:38:32.120]   walking with him.
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:37.200]   And so knowledge of who God is and the truths that come out of that will not apply to you
[00:38:37.200 --> 00:38:47.980]   no matter how much you think about it unless you know him and you're walking with him because
[00:38:47.980 --> 00:38:50.940]   you see him.
[00:38:50.940 --> 00:38:55.160]   How can you tell someone not to be afraid?
[00:38:55.160 --> 00:38:57.580]   How cruel.
[00:38:57.580 --> 00:39:01.220]   What sad counseling.
[00:39:01.220 --> 00:39:03.360]   Until what?
[00:39:03.360 --> 00:39:05.580]   Until this great reality comes.
[00:39:05.580 --> 00:39:12.580]   Until the eyes are like, "See!"
[00:39:12.580 --> 00:39:16.580]   It's really interesting as parents of younger children.
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:19.060]   My kids are six, two, and four.
[00:39:19.060 --> 00:39:20.420]   They're very young.
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:24.380]   So they all have different places of understanding.
[00:39:24.380 --> 00:39:29.300]   One of the things that's very interesting about this command not to fear is that you
[00:39:29.300 --> 00:39:36.580]   can't tell someone to not be afraid unless they're afraid.
[00:39:36.580 --> 00:39:40.220]   You guys know what I mean?
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:43.540]   So as a parent, here's what I've seen.
[00:39:43.540 --> 00:39:47.300]   There's things that happen very commonplace in young kids' homes.
[00:39:47.300 --> 00:39:51.540]   And one of those things is you're doing something, you're doing the dishes or cleaning or trying
[00:39:51.540 --> 00:39:55.220]   to get things done, and then you hear a "pah" in the other room.
[00:39:55.220 --> 00:39:57.500]   As a parent, you just know.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.220]   Next thing you do is your ears just perk up and listen for the next thing.
[00:40:00.220 --> 00:40:04.380]   There's a next sound that comes that's going to tell you what happened.
[00:40:04.380 --> 00:40:08.020]   So if there's laughter, you're like, "Oh, okay.
[00:40:08.020 --> 00:40:09.940]   Someone did something funny."
[00:40:09.940 --> 00:40:16.260]   But if there's the shrill cry, and every parent of a young child knows it, the shrill cry
[00:40:16.260 --> 00:40:21.500]   that comes of a child who is just telling the universe that they've been wronged, and
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:26.020]   you walk into this room, and then there's one child on the ground writhing in pain,
[00:40:26.020 --> 00:40:29.380]   acting like they got shot, and then there's this other child just sitting there like a
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.900]   sociopath just staring with no feeling in his face.
[00:40:32.900 --> 00:40:36.140]   You're like, "What happened?"
[00:40:36.140 --> 00:40:37.140]   Right?
[00:40:37.140 --> 00:40:41.980]   Okay, first of all, it's like, to my daughter, I'm like, "Stop being dramatic."
[00:40:41.980 --> 00:40:44.340]   Now you can see the dynamics in my home.
[00:40:44.340 --> 00:40:45.980]   To my oldest daughter, "Stop being dramatic."
[00:40:45.980 --> 00:40:51.700]   So I got to have the conversation, but my other kid's just staring.
[00:40:51.700 --> 00:40:55.940]   I'm like, "What is going on?
[00:40:55.940 --> 00:40:56.940]   Say something.
[00:40:56.940 --> 00:40:57.940]   Say sorry.
[00:40:57.940 --> 00:40:59.980]   Go to them.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.180]   Do you not see them screaming in pain?
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:06.260]   What is going on with you?"
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:08.660]   And sometimes in my mind, it's silence.
[00:41:08.660 --> 00:41:10.780]   Honestly, I come and I just watch.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:15.100]   But in my mind, it's like, "Sinner!
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:17.140]   Confess!
[00:41:17.140 --> 00:41:19.580]   Repent before Almighty God!
[00:41:19.580 --> 00:41:20.580]   You sinner!"
[00:41:20.580 --> 00:41:21.580]   Right?
[00:41:21.580 --> 00:41:22.580]   It's just, "Come on, parents.
[00:41:22.580 --> 00:41:23.580]   You guys know what I'm talking about."
[00:41:23.580 --> 00:41:28.900]   You're like, "What is the matter with you?"
[00:41:28.900 --> 00:41:33.980]   Because when we see this in our face, in the face of our child, we can see it.
[00:41:33.980 --> 00:41:36.340]   We can see the hardening.
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:41.820]   And so what I've noticed is that when this happens in my house, I can't tell this kid
[00:41:41.820 --> 00:41:42.820]   to say, "Sorry."
[00:41:42.820 --> 00:41:43.820]   Right?
[00:41:43.820 --> 00:41:44.820]   And every parent knows this.
[00:41:44.820 --> 00:41:45.820]   This is a talking point.
[00:41:45.820 --> 00:41:46.820]   We all know this.
[00:41:46.820 --> 00:41:49.020]   We all want what?
[00:41:49.020 --> 00:41:50.900]   To mean it.
[00:41:50.900 --> 00:41:52.100]   We want the kid to mean it.
[00:41:52.100 --> 00:41:56.220]   So if they say, "Sorry," then we're not satisfied with that.
[00:41:56.220 --> 00:41:58.780]   And so it's not about getting them just to say the right things.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:41:59.900]   What do we want?
[00:41:59.900 --> 00:42:05.280]   We want them to see.
[00:42:05.280 --> 00:42:08.620]   Sometimes it can drive a parent crazy when they just stand there.
[00:42:08.620 --> 00:42:10.980]   There's no fear in them.
[00:42:10.980 --> 00:42:17.300]   No understanding of broken law or trespass or sinfulness.
[00:42:17.300 --> 00:42:22.740]   Just all thinking about myself.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:27.300]   Now how could you extend comfort to this child?
[00:42:27.300 --> 00:42:30.460]   How can you extend grace or mercy to this child?
[00:42:30.460 --> 00:42:35.800]   As a parent, you come in and all you want is to restore this relationship and that relationship.
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:39.280]   That's all you want.
[00:42:39.280 --> 00:42:41.240]   It's not even about the thing being done anymore.
[00:42:41.240 --> 00:42:45.160]   Like initially, it's just like you want to get to a place where you love them and you
[00:42:45.160 --> 00:42:47.320]   can hug them and you can say, "It's okay."
[00:42:47.320 --> 00:42:53.760]   But you can't say, "It's okay," because of the hardness of their heart.
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   You can't.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.560]   They're just standing there.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:42:58.560]   "It's okay.
[00:42:58.560 --> 00:42:59.560]   I love you.
[00:42:59.560 --> 00:43:00.560]   I forgive you."
[00:43:00.560 --> 00:43:04.160]   They're just standing there.
[00:43:04.160 --> 00:43:07.840]   But there are other times when I see that they can understand.
[00:43:07.840 --> 00:43:09.400]   It's in their response.
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:10.720]   It's written on their face.
[00:43:10.720 --> 00:43:11.720]   They can't hide it.
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.000]   They immediately start crying.
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.160]   So this kid is crying here and another kid is crying here.
[00:43:17.160 --> 00:43:18.160]   That's a good sign.
[00:43:18.160 --> 00:43:19.160]   They say, "Sorry."
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:22.920]   They know they did wrong.
[00:43:22.920 --> 00:43:23.920]   There's some fear in them.
[00:43:23.920 --> 00:43:26.920]   They heard dad's footsteps approaching.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:34.840]   In that place, can I tell you as a parent, my first response is to want to hug.
[00:43:34.840 --> 00:43:37.940]   I want to extend mercy.
[00:43:37.940 --> 00:43:39.120]   I want to extend comfort.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:43.280]   I want to say, "It's okay."
[00:43:43.280 --> 00:43:48.240]   There's things that have to be talked about, but that's my heart.
[00:43:48.240 --> 00:43:52.680]   I think about this sometimes when I think of this image of a Pharisee who's so bold
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.880]   and arrogant and all the puffed up knowledge, who believes in his prayers about a great
[00:43:56.880 --> 00:44:03.200]   God, a great God of great size and sheer magnitude, about a God that is so holy.
[00:44:03.200 --> 00:44:08.480]   This Pharisee who's able to explain to great detail what the holy of holies is like, why
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:14.680]   the curtain is there, why gold overlay, why the purple color, why all of these things.
[00:44:14.680 --> 00:44:17.000]   They're able to explain it and teach it to people.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:21.040]   They're able to say with their mouths, with great theological understanding, that God
[00:44:21.040 --> 00:44:23.040]   is a great God.
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:25.560]   They're standing there before God saying, "God, thank you for not making me like this
[00:44:25.560 --> 00:44:26.880]   man right here."
[00:44:26.880 --> 00:44:33.440]   You look and pivot and you stare at another man that's there that's broken, weeping, crying
[00:44:33.440 --> 00:44:35.320]   next to them.
[00:44:35.320 --> 00:44:41.240]   All that's coming out of their mouth is, "Be merciful to me, a sinner."
[00:44:41.240 --> 00:44:43.640]   Who has greater understanding here?
[00:44:43.640 --> 00:44:46.920]   There or there?
[00:44:46.920 --> 00:44:53.800]   Where does the heart of God go, here or there?
[00:44:53.800 --> 00:45:02.560]   When Jesus says, "Do not be afraid," there is a foundational aspect of fear that ought
[00:45:02.560 --> 00:45:06.520]   to be there.
[00:45:06.520 --> 00:45:09.120]   The natural response of fear has already been instilled.
[00:45:09.120 --> 00:45:13.080]   He cannot say, "Do not fear," to those who are not fearing to begin with.
[00:45:13.080 --> 00:45:18.560]   He cannot give us comfort, even in the things that we fear in this world, because we're
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.440]   not even looking at Him.
[00:45:22.440 --> 00:45:23.440]   He just can't.
[00:45:23.440 --> 00:45:27.720]   Where Jesus says, "Do not fear," it's because the natural response of fear has already been
[00:45:27.720 --> 00:45:28.720]   instilled.
[00:45:28.720 --> 00:45:36.640]   That's why passage after passage, the response was, "Fear, fear, fear, afraid, scared, terrified,
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.520]   falling, move away from me, get out of our city."
[00:45:40.520 --> 00:45:45.640]   And then He says, "Don't be afraid."
[00:45:45.640 --> 00:45:53.880]   That's the appropriate sequence.
[00:45:53.880 --> 00:45:56.800]   So when we think about the things we fear in our lives, the fear of God must be the
[00:45:56.800 --> 00:45:58.440]   foundation of everything.
[00:45:58.440 --> 00:46:01.640]   That's why the fear of God is the beginning of knowledge.
[00:46:01.640 --> 00:46:06.820]   It's the beginning of our sight, understanding, reality, paradigm.
[00:46:06.820 --> 00:46:08.340]   It affects our decisions.
[00:46:08.340 --> 00:46:10.980]   It affects the way we perceive wrongs.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:19.400]   It affects everything, because God brings us to our fourth point.
[00:46:19.400 --> 00:46:24.680]   So in Luke, the common response was fear, and then He says, "Do not be afraid."
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:28.480]   And so in our fourth point then, the fear of God actually brings us comfort.
[00:46:28.480 --> 00:46:29.480]   I love this so much.
[00:46:29.480 --> 00:46:33.280]   The fear of God brings us comfort.
[00:46:33.280 --> 00:46:35.760]   When Jesus says, "Do not fear," notice that it's a command.
[00:46:35.760 --> 00:46:37.540]   It's an imperative.
[00:46:37.540 --> 00:46:39.680]   It's an order or a call to action.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:44.320]   It's telling us what we must do.
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:45.680]   That's what a command is.
[00:46:45.680 --> 00:46:49.680]   But how much of this actually is a command in the way we might two-dimensionally think
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:52.180]   about it?
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:56.920]   I thought about it as I sat there in the middle of the night with my son one day.
[00:46:56.920 --> 00:47:00.880]   When he's crying because he's scared of the dark, I thought about it also with my daughter.
[00:47:00.880 --> 00:47:04.120]   It's crying because she's afraid someone's going to walk through our front door and asking
[00:47:04.120 --> 00:47:06.120]   if the doors are locked.
[00:47:06.120 --> 00:47:12.360]   I'm sitting there, and as a parent, especially as a male, I think it's a very male thing
[00:47:12.360 --> 00:47:17.320]   to try to solve, rationalize.
[00:47:17.320 --> 00:47:22.600]   So I'm sitting there with a five-year-old and a three-year-old trying to rationalize.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:24.360]   And it's so funny.
[00:47:24.360 --> 00:47:28.960]   It was like the rationalizing I need to do is actually not quite rational, but I have
[00:47:28.960 --> 00:47:32.000]   to tell them things.
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.080]   You don't have to be afraid of someone breaking into our house.
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:37.080]   Why?
[00:47:37.080 --> 00:47:39.080]   Isn't that an actual reality?
[00:47:39.080 --> 00:47:43.080]   He's right back there, so I'm trying to be quiet.
[00:47:43.080 --> 00:47:45.280]   Someone could break in.
[00:47:45.280 --> 00:47:46.280]   That's the reality.
[00:47:46.280 --> 00:47:47.280]   But what do you say?
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:50.280]   You can't say that to a kid in the middle of the night.
[00:47:50.280 --> 00:47:53.280]   Yeah, that's true.
[00:47:53.280 --> 00:48:00.880]   I had to try all sorts of things, even ridiculous things, things that I'm like, that sound,
[00:48:00.880 --> 00:48:02.760]   that look so foolish.
[00:48:02.760 --> 00:48:06.080]   If you were to look at me through the monitor, you'd just be like, it's so funny, a grown
[00:48:06.080 --> 00:48:11.760]   man trying to convince them that this doll will somehow protect them.
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:14.160]   You're sitting there trying to rationalize, rationalize.
[00:48:14.160 --> 00:48:18.360]   What I learned, nothing works.
[00:48:18.360 --> 00:48:19.360]   Nothing works.
[00:48:19.360 --> 00:48:23.520]   It drives you crazy.
[00:48:23.520 --> 00:48:26.600]   You figure out something that works, an hour later, they're calling you again and saying
[00:48:26.600 --> 00:48:27.960]   the same thing.
[00:48:27.960 --> 00:48:28.960]   We had this talk.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:32.360]   What's the matter with you?
[00:48:32.360 --> 00:48:41.320]   It ends in heightened anger as you're like, go to sleep, please.
[00:48:41.320 --> 00:48:46.400]   But as a parent, what I realized, the only thing that works is when I say, Daddy is here.
[00:48:46.400 --> 00:48:48.400]   It's very fascinating to me.
[00:48:48.400 --> 00:48:50.880]   I say, Daddy's here.
[00:48:50.880 --> 00:48:53.640]   You don't have to be afraid because I'm here.
[00:48:53.640 --> 00:48:57.960]   There's nothing else that works like it.
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:48:58.960]   It's funny.
[00:48:58.960 --> 00:49:02.240]   To my kids, so ridiculous.
[00:49:02.240 --> 00:49:07.920]   They think I'm the biggest, strongest, tallest person in the world.
[00:49:07.920 --> 00:49:13.200]   I can take out any of you guys in my kids' eyes.
[00:49:13.200 --> 00:49:15.840]   I don't care what kind of MMA you do.
[00:49:15.840 --> 00:49:21.080]   In my kids' eyes, if I'm going up against you, you're dead.
[00:49:21.080 --> 00:49:23.560]   I could beat any game.
[00:49:23.560 --> 00:49:25.720]   I could do miracles.
[00:49:25.720 --> 00:49:27.920]   I could heal with a band-aid.
[00:49:27.920 --> 00:49:30.480]   With my words, I could cause things to happen.
[00:49:30.480 --> 00:49:33.040]   I do magic.
[00:49:33.040 --> 00:49:35.120]   That's who they see.
[00:49:35.120 --> 00:49:42.200]   So when God is not big in us, it's kind of like, I wonder what kind of sight do we have
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:45.320]   of him?
[00:49:45.320 --> 00:49:49.600]   God says, do not be afraid, and we continue to be fearful.
[00:49:49.600 --> 00:49:57.200]   What kind of relationship do we have with our God?
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:06.200]   With them, it's almost ridiculous, but that peace comes to them.
[00:50:06.200 --> 00:50:08.840]   Without the fear of the Lord, there can be no comfort.
[00:50:08.840 --> 00:50:16.500]   Without an understanding of this fearsome sight of a huge God, about what he can do,
[00:50:16.500 --> 00:50:22.800]   what he is able to do, the magnitude and scope of that is the thing that will bring comfort
[00:50:22.800 --> 00:50:28.800]   into us, just as it will bring comfort from daddy to child.
[00:50:28.800 --> 00:50:32.120]   It doesn't matter if their understanding is erroneous.
[00:50:32.120 --> 00:50:36.320]   They're sitting there, and what matters is what they believe.
[00:50:36.320 --> 00:50:38.400]   Dad will protect me.
[00:50:38.400 --> 00:50:40.240]   Dad will always be there.
[00:50:40.240 --> 00:50:46.240]   So that sight, that understanding, that belief causes them to be able to go back to sleep.
[00:50:46.240 --> 00:50:52.200]   It actually eases all other fear, because dad is scary.
[00:50:52.200 --> 00:50:54.040]   Dad is strong.
[00:50:54.040 --> 00:50:56.040]   Dad is big.
[00:50:56.040 --> 00:51:03.080]   Luke, as a book, is filled with this idea of fear God, and then this comforting command,
[00:51:03.080 --> 00:51:06.060]   do not fear.
[00:51:06.060 --> 00:51:10.160]   This is where we encounter, just shortly, servile versus filial fear.
[00:51:10.160 --> 00:51:11.880]   There's two types of fear that we can look at.
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:17.440]   R.C. Sproul talks about servile fear as referring to a posture of servitude toward a malevolent
[00:51:17.440 --> 00:51:18.440]   owner.
[00:51:18.440 --> 00:51:24.680]   It's a fear of anxiety that comes because we are terrified of this person, this person
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.160]   of power who can do us great harm.
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.160]   That's servile fear.
[00:51:29.160 --> 00:51:34.520]   This idea of filial fear has more to do when a child has fear of their parents, something
[00:51:34.520 --> 00:51:39.800]   like that.
[00:51:39.800 --> 00:51:44.520]   R.C. Sproul says, "It is a fear of offending the one he loves, not because he's afraid
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:48.680]   of torture or even of punishment, but rather because he's afraid of displeasing the one
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:52.280]   who is, in that child's world, the source of security and love."
[00:51:52.280 --> 00:51:56.840]   I love that last part.
[00:51:56.840 --> 00:52:01.280]   Sometimes we have that idea of displeasing God, and we're afraid of that, but this idea
[00:52:01.280 --> 00:52:05.040]   of displeasing the one who is our everything.
[00:52:05.040 --> 00:52:08.040]   My kids do that.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.080]   They do something wrong, and immediately, do you know what they do when they do something
[00:52:11.080 --> 00:52:12.080]   wrong?
[00:52:12.080 --> 00:52:15.080]   Their eyes just go to you.
[00:52:15.080 --> 00:52:16.080]   So funny.
[00:52:16.080 --> 00:52:17.080]   They're looking.
[00:52:17.080 --> 00:52:20.080]   Did he see?
[00:52:20.080 --> 00:52:27.960]   Even when they do something right, they go, "Did he see?"
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.400]   This is the incredible nature of adoption as children of God.
[00:52:31.400 --> 00:52:34.560]   Our response and reaction must be set immediately on true sight.
[00:52:34.560 --> 00:52:39.640]   We don't jump to grace and mercy.
[00:52:39.640 --> 00:52:42.600]   We can't.
[00:52:42.600 --> 00:52:44.960]   We need to first see God for who he is.
[00:52:44.960 --> 00:52:52.840]   Do we get that?
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:59.920]   We don't jump to grace and mercy and love because we are so filled with a view of ourselves.
[00:52:59.920 --> 00:53:05.000]   We think we deserve it, but we can't.
[00:53:05.000 --> 00:53:10.820]   We must see God for who he is, the massive God, the creator.
[00:53:10.820 --> 00:53:15.880]   He can do whatever he wants, but as soon as he adopts me as his child, when we have this
[00:53:15.880 --> 00:53:21.640]   pervading and bigger and growing magnitude of God and who he is, that our fear of him
[00:53:21.640 --> 00:53:28.320]   grows, that when that fear grows, he says, "Do not fear."
[00:53:28.320 --> 00:53:31.440]   We cannot be afraid of anything in this world.
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:35.720]   It doesn't matter how big that fear seems.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:36.720]   God.
[00:53:36.720 --> 00:53:44.840]   Now, if you're an unbeliever, fear is appropriate, but it's a servile fear.
[00:53:44.840 --> 00:53:48.800]   Matthew 10:28 says, "Do not fear those who kill the body but are unable to kill the soul,
[00:53:48.800 --> 00:53:52.400]   but rather fear him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell."
[00:53:52.400 --> 00:53:56.600]   In Hebrews 10:30 it says, "For we know him who said, 'Vengeance is mine, I will repay.'
[00:53:56.600 --> 00:53:58.240]   And again, the Lord will judge people.
[00:53:58.240 --> 00:54:02.380]   It is a terrifying thing to fall into the hands of the living God."
[00:54:02.380 --> 00:54:07.600]   It is appropriate for you to be afraid of God because he is not for you, he is against
[00:54:07.600 --> 00:54:08.920]   you.
[00:54:08.920 --> 00:54:10.520]   There is no story of hope.
[00:54:10.520 --> 00:54:15.040]   There is no Disney happy ending for you.
[00:54:15.040 --> 00:54:19.960]   There is only a call for you to turn to him and surrender.
[00:54:19.960 --> 00:54:21.320]   He is a good God.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:26.640]   If you are a believer, it also means fear God, but you are now under not a servile fear,
[00:54:26.640 --> 00:54:29.560]   but a filial fear.
[00:54:29.560 --> 00:54:32.320]   Appropriately understand who he is.
[00:54:32.320 --> 00:54:36.320]   He has not in any way changed in who he was before you became a believer.
[00:54:36.320 --> 00:54:39.080]   He has been the same yesterday, today, forever.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:40.160]   He is immutable.
[00:54:40.160 --> 00:54:43.440]   He does not change.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:46.520]   We fear him because we see who he is still.
[00:54:46.520 --> 00:54:48.640]   All of it is out of love.
[00:54:48.640 --> 00:54:52.960]   Our fear of God as it's grown because we walk with him, we know who he is.
[00:54:52.960 --> 00:54:56.480]   We understand not just in here, but because I am walking with him day by day.
[00:54:56.480 --> 00:54:57.560]   I am talking to him.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:54:58.920]   I am hearing from him.
[00:54:58.920 --> 00:55:01.560]   The experience is there of me abiding.
[00:55:01.560 --> 00:55:04.320]   You cannot think of abiding without experience.
[00:55:04.320 --> 00:55:08.400]   That there is a true understanding that goes beyond just facts that are running through
[00:55:08.400 --> 00:55:09.400]   your head.
[00:55:09.400 --> 00:55:10.880]   It is him.
[00:55:10.880 --> 00:55:17.400]   I cannot doubt his existence because it is not just factual like, "Could he potentially
[00:55:17.400 --> 00:55:18.400]   be?"
[00:55:18.400 --> 00:55:25.280]   No, no, no, because I know him.
[00:55:25.280 --> 00:55:30.960]   We look and we see this kind of God and isn't it so close to us?
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:35.080]   Isn't it so quick when we look at something like, "He will do all things together for
[00:55:35.080 --> 00:55:37.840]   the good of those who love him, who are called according to his purposes."
[00:55:37.840 --> 00:55:38.840]   I believe that.
[00:55:38.840 --> 00:55:40.560]   I know that that's who he is.
[00:55:40.560 --> 00:55:42.200]   It is not just a Bible thought.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.720]   It is not just a Christian concept of belief.
[00:55:44.720 --> 00:55:46.680]   That's him.
[00:55:46.680 --> 00:55:52.600]   That's who he is.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:53.600]   Our God is for us.
[00:55:53.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   Who then can be against us?
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:55:55.600]   That's who God is.
[00:55:55.600 --> 00:56:00.520]   Psalm 56.3 says, "When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you."
[00:56:00.520 --> 00:56:03.240]   It says, "When I am afraid."
[00:56:03.240 --> 00:56:04.760]   Fear is a given.
[00:56:04.760 --> 00:56:05.760]   We are fearers.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:13.560]   We fear things, but it says, "When I am afraid, I will put my trust in you."
[00:56:13.560 --> 00:56:19.840]   If our view of God is so low and weak, our trust has to be weak because we don't actually
[00:56:19.840 --> 00:56:20.840]   believe him.
[00:56:20.840 --> 00:56:23.040]   We don't actually trust him.
[00:56:23.040 --> 00:56:27.040]   But when it's big, it's different.
[00:56:27.040 --> 00:56:31.080]   First Peter 5.6 says, "Therefore, humble yourselves under the mighty hand of God that he may exalt
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:36.800]   you at the proper time, casting all your anxiety on him because he cares for you."
[00:56:36.800 --> 00:56:38.860]   Brings us to our fifth and final point.
[00:56:38.860 --> 00:56:40.080]   Do you trust God?
[00:56:40.080 --> 00:56:41.960]   This is where I just want to give it back to you now.
[00:56:41.960 --> 00:56:44.960]   I want to ask you this question.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:51.200]   Do you trust God?
[00:56:51.200 --> 00:56:55.120]   Our sight can't be based on me.
[00:56:55.120 --> 00:56:57.720]   It needs to be based on him.
[00:56:57.720 --> 00:57:00.480]   The fear of God is the foundation and the hinge and the beginning.
[00:57:00.480 --> 00:57:03.440]   The fear of God is what leads us right.
[00:57:03.440 --> 00:57:05.040]   So it's fixed on him.
[00:57:05.040 --> 00:57:07.900]   But do you trust him?
[00:57:07.900 --> 00:57:10.260]   It changes our whole lives.
[00:57:10.260 --> 00:57:14.120]   Everything that we fear is not that God's going to correct it to the way we want it
[00:57:14.120 --> 00:57:16.840]   to be.
[00:57:16.840 --> 00:57:20.040]   Because our lives are not based upon what I see in my own life.
[00:57:20.040 --> 00:57:22.400]   It's not on self-idolatry anymore.
[00:57:22.400 --> 00:57:24.680]   It's not on just what I want anymore.
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:26.960]   I look at God and he consumes everything.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:29.640]   He becomes everything to me and I fear him.
[00:57:29.640 --> 00:57:35.520]   So even when things aren't going the way I might want it to go, in fact and in reality,
[00:57:35.520 --> 00:57:38.480]   a great trust happens there.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:43.800]   Because even if none of the things that I want happens in my life, it will not shake
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:44.800]   me.
[00:57:44.800 --> 00:57:48.240]   Because I trust in God.
[00:57:48.240 --> 00:57:49.240]   He is the center.
[00:57:49.240 --> 00:57:53.040]   He is the one that we fear.
[00:57:53.040 --> 00:57:59.240]   When everything is going wrong, we understand that we live for God's glory, God's desire,
[00:57:59.240 --> 00:58:00.240]   because that's who he is.
[00:58:00.240 --> 00:58:03.240]   He's God.
[00:58:03.240 --> 00:58:05.800]   And at the end, his desire is for his glory and our good.
[00:58:05.800 --> 00:58:06.800]   It's a package deal.
[00:58:06.800 --> 00:58:12.640]   You cannot have the "for my good" without him.
[00:58:12.640 --> 00:58:15.680]   And we'll be ultimately brought to a place where the things of this world are going to
[00:58:15.680 --> 00:58:17.280]   just start dissolving away.
[00:58:17.280 --> 00:58:23.160]   I think great counseling happens just naturally every day in the lives of believers as they
[00:58:23.160 --> 00:58:24.520]   encounter the Word of God.
[00:58:24.520 --> 00:58:28.120]   Because there are places and times when we go to a counselor and we ask them to help
[00:58:28.120 --> 00:58:33.000]   us to understand, but natural counseling always happens because all it's doing is drawing
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:37.800]   you to God, to his words, to believe in him.
[00:58:37.800 --> 00:58:42.000]   Because when you're walking with him, fears just naturally melt away.
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.680]   Again, don't take it like with the concept.
[00:58:45.680 --> 00:58:48.360]   Try to really think about the experiences that you had in your life.
[00:58:48.360 --> 00:58:49.360]   Is it difficult?
[00:58:49.360 --> 00:58:50.360]   Yes.
[00:58:50.360 --> 00:58:51.360]   I'm not saying that difficulty is not there.
[00:58:51.360 --> 00:58:56.800]   I'm saying the fear is dissolved, that your trust grows in those places.
[00:58:56.800 --> 00:58:59.160]   We're not mastered by our fears.
[00:58:59.160 --> 00:59:03.120]   We're not mastered by the fear of a pandemic or of a certain politics that's sweeping over
[00:59:03.120 --> 00:59:05.060]   the state.
[00:59:05.060 --> 00:59:11.680]   We're not afraid of kids getting the best education, the threat of lost jobs, of a career
[00:59:11.680 --> 00:59:17.640]   that doesn't satisfy, never getting married, not having kids, developing a life-threatening
[00:59:17.640 --> 00:59:19.720]   disease, loss of reputation.
[00:59:19.720 --> 00:59:21.280]   We're not afraid of these things.
[00:59:21.280 --> 00:59:22.840]   Not why, because we're not supposed to?
[00:59:22.840 --> 00:59:25.920]   No, no, they're scary.
[00:59:25.920 --> 00:59:30.560]   But because as we walk with the Lord, the fear of God dissolves all these things.
[00:59:30.560 --> 00:59:34.880]   We understand that we want him to be everything.
[00:59:34.880 --> 00:59:42.200]   There must be surrendering and yielding of our will before God in this.
[00:59:42.200 --> 00:59:46.560]   So my hope is as we go into this new year, that we don't jump to that comfort part.
[00:59:46.560 --> 00:59:52.320]   We want all of God's comfort so that we might attain to whatever it is that my heart desires
[00:59:52.320 --> 00:59:55.040]   so much.
[00:59:55.040 --> 00:59:58.200]   That we need to appropriately go through these steps.
[00:59:58.200 --> 01:00:00.880]   No fear of God, there is no understanding.
[01:00:00.880 --> 01:00:03.560]   No fear of God, there is no knowledge.
[01:00:03.560 --> 01:00:07.280]   So that's the question that I want echoing in all of us.
[01:00:07.280 --> 01:00:09.720]   Where's my fear?
[01:00:09.720 --> 01:00:12.800]   Have I been cultivating a fear of God?
[01:00:12.800 --> 01:00:16.240]   Have I been cultivating a fear of many other things?
[01:00:16.240 --> 01:00:20.480]   Let me leave you with Psalm 23.
[01:00:20.480 --> 01:00:26.640]   And just to highlight, I know many of us know this, but the pronouns.
[01:00:26.640 --> 01:00:28.840]   The pronouns are so important in this Psalm.
[01:00:28.840 --> 01:00:33.320]   In Psalm 23, it says, "The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.
[01:00:33.320 --> 01:00:35.320]   He makes me lie down in green pastures.
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.000]   He leads me beside quiet waters.
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:38.240]   He restores my soul.
[01:00:38.240 --> 01:00:41.000]   He guides me in the paths of righteousness for his namesake.
[01:00:41.000 --> 01:00:44.080]   Even though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.080]   with me.
[01:00:45.080 --> 01:00:46.920]   Your rod and your staff, they comfort me.
[01:00:46.920 --> 01:00:49.680]   You prepare a table before me in the presence of my enemies.
[01:00:49.680 --> 01:00:51.440]   You have anointed my head with oil.
[01:00:51.440 --> 01:00:52.440]   My cup overflows.
[01:00:52.440 --> 01:00:55.800]   Surely, goodness and loving kindness will follow me all the days of my life, and I will
[01:00:55.800 --> 01:00:58.240]   dwell in the house of the Lord forever."
[01:00:58.240 --> 01:00:59.240]   And the pronouns.
[01:00:59.240 --> 01:01:02.960]   There are so many things we know conceptually about our God.
[01:01:02.960 --> 01:01:05.120]   We know that he is our shepherd.
[01:01:05.120 --> 01:01:07.800]   We know that he will lead me into green pastures.
[01:01:07.800 --> 01:01:10.640]   We know that he will lead me to quiet waters.
[01:01:10.640 --> 01:01:11.720]   He will restore my soul.
[01:01:11.720 --> 01:01:13.760]   He will guide me in paths of righteousness.
[01:01:13.760 --> 01:01:19.320]   But in this passage, it's so powerful when David pivots into the you, from the third
[01:01:19.320 --> 01:01:23.160]   to the second pronoun of God, and he says, "Even though I walk through the valley of
[01:01:23.160 --> 01:01:28.480]   the shadow of death, I will fear no evil for not he is with me, but you are with me."
[01:01:28.480 --> 01:01:34.160]   And that idea of intimacy and knowledge is powerful because it's not about knowing facts
[01:01:34.160 --> 01:01:35.160]   about God.
[01:01:35.160 --> 01:01:37.560]   It is walking with him.
[01:01:37.560 --> 01:01:42.080]   It's understanding that there are going to be dark times in our lives, and the fear isn't
[01:01:42.080 --> 01:01:46.400]   going to evaporate in just knowing that God will just make things happen right.
[01:01:46.400 --> 01:01:48.200]   It's when we feel close to him.
[01:01:48.200 --> 01:01:49.760]   When we know he's real.
[01:01:49.760 --> 01:01:54.400]   When we know that all will be right in the world because I am in his embrace.
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:59.360]   That if you today have gotten so far from that because of your present day fear, that
[01:01:59.360 --> 01:02:04.680]   your fear of the Lord isn't exuding into the way we make our decisions, into our convictions,
[01:02:04.680 --> 01:02:11.560]   into the way we even just feel, that we might properly go into the new year with a fear
[01:02:11.560 --> 01:02:14.600]   of God that takes over and consumes all else.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:24.280]   Let me pray for us.
[01:02:24.280 --> 01:02:30.760]   Heavenly Father, I pray that you would not just cast away our fears.
[01:02:30.760 --> 01:02:36.960]   God, some of the things that many of our church members are facing right now is scary.
[01:02:36.960 --> 01:02:39.640]   It's hard and it's very difficult.
[01:02:39.640 --> 01:02:43.120]   It's dark and it's lonely.
[01:02:43.120 --> 01:02:47.320]   God, we can't reason those things away.
[01:02:47.320 --> 01:02:53.360]   We can't just insert facts that we ought to trust you into our brains.
[01:02:53.360 --> 01:02:59.280]   Lord, I pray that our church will be people who walk with you.
[01:02:59.280 --> 01:03:03.880]   Lord, please, we need you.
[01:03:03.880 --> 01:03:10.760]   We are so led by so many other worships, so many other gods.
[01:03:10.760 --> 01:03:15.720]   We come again to you today and say you are our God alone.
[01:03:15.720 --> 01:03:17.760]   We fear you alone.
[01:03:17.760 --> 01:03:19.440]   There is no one like you.
[01:03:19.440 --> 01:03:21.060]   There is no one but you.
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:23.920]   There is only you in our lives.
[01:03:23.920 --> 01:03:26.000]   Fill our viewfinders.
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:30.960]   Fill our lens, our landscape, our worldview that the way we see would be through the fear
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.520]   of God.
[01:03:32.520 --> 01:03:36.000]   Help us transform our hearts.
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.800]   Help us to be near to you, to draw near to you in every way.
[01:03:38.800 --> 01:03:39.800]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:03:39.800 --> 01:03:40.080]   Amen.
[01:03:40.080 --> 01:03:48.820]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
