[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   All right, we're in Leviticus chapter 2, and the homework was for 2 and 3, but I told you
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.560]   I wasn't sure if I was going to go at that pace.
[00:00:14.560 --> 00:00:22.080]   You know, I, again, for this week we're just going to be covering the law for the grain
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.000]   offering and the next week is going to be the law for the peace offering.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.400]   So each one of these things have so much significance and I felt like covering 2 and 3 would be
[00:00:30.400 --> 00:00:33.880]   too much and I'm going to have to cram and just kind of speed through these things.
[00:00:33.880 --> 00:00:39.480]   And even if it is less material, I think it's better for us to slow down, especially in
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:44.920]   this area, because the first five offerings are so foundational to our understanding of
[00:00:44.920 --> 00:00:48.080]   the gospel and everything that takes place in the New Testament.
[00:00:48.080 --> 00:00:51.900]   So if you have a superficial understanding of this, you're kind of missing the foundation.
[00:00:51.900 --> 00:00:54.200]   So again, we're going to be going slow.
[00:00:54.200 --> 00:00:57.920]   So this week is going to be the grain offering, next week we're going to be going into the
[00:00:57.920 --> 00:00:59.300]   peace offering.
[00:00:59.300 --> 00:01:03.840]   And as you are reading this, there's chunks of it in chapter 6 and chapter 7.
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:07.400]   It goes into a little bit more detail and instruction.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:12.160]   So the main part of the teaching on the grain offering obviously is in chapter 2, but also
[00:01:12.160 --> 00:01:18.240]   there is a small portion, maybe a few verses in chapter 6, and then when you get to the
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:25.520]   peace offering in chapter 3, chapter 7, I think verse 11 through 21, I apologize, I
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.280]   should have put it on here, but it's not on here, but there's a small portion.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:33.040]   If you flip through your Bible to chapter 7, you'll be able to see it in there.
[00:01:33.040 --> 00:01:39.600]   And so there's some, a little bit more instructions on the peace offering in chapter 7.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.180]   So I encourage you guys to take a look at that.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:45.440]   And then when we get there to chapter 6 and 7, we're not going to spend this kind of time
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:50.800]   on it, okay, because this is all kind of integrated, even if I don't specifically mention chapter
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:57.280]   7, we are going to be in a few of the verses in chapter 7, okay?
[00:01:57.280 --> 00:01:59.200]   So let me pray for us and then we'll jump right in.
[00:01:59.200 --> 00:02:05.260]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you so much for this evening.
[00:02:05.260 --> 00:02:08.120]   We thank you, Lord God, for your living word.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:14.780]   And we know, Father God, that we have such great access to it, to be able to study it
[00:02:14.780 --> 00:02:21.120]   in English, to have the resources and so much of it, Lord, around us.
[00:02:21.120 --> 00:02:26.120]   I'm not realizing what a blessing, a true blessing this is, Lord God, to be able to
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:34.840]   interact with you, to know your heart, your will, to be able to study commentaries and
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:40.340]   scholars, Lord God, who have in-depth understanding of all of these things, Lord.
[00:02:40.340 --> 00:02:44.120]   Help us not to take any of these things for granted.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:48.320]   Help us as we study this book that you will give us a clear understanding of who you are
[00:02:48.320 --> 00:02:54.980]   and what you have done and why it was so important for the nation of Israel to take so much time
[00:02:54.980 --> 00:02:58.640]   in obeying these details.
[00:02:58.640 --> 00:03:03.340]   And we know that every part of these things, Lord God, was with a purpose.
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:07.660]   Help us to understand as much as possible so that we may have greater insight into Christ
[00:03:07.660 --> 00:03:09.680]   and what he has done.
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:15.240]   And so we pray for your blessing and your Holy Spirit, eagerness in our heart to learn
[00:03:15.240 --> 00:03:17.040]   and to apply all of these things in our lives.
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:19.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:19.880 --> 00:03:22.780]   All right, so let's look at the grain offering.
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:26.720]   The first thing that we want to look at is the meaning of the grain offering.
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:31.440]   Again, there's not a lot of details where it says this is the purpose and this is the
[00:03:31.440 --> 00:03:37.300]   reason why people can get so easily lost in the book of Leviticus, because you really
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:39.840]   have to take time to dig.
[00:03:39.840 --> 00:03:43.240]   If you just read it like you're reading a Bible plan and you read three chapters of
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:47.240]   Leviticus, obviously, you know, these are not things that you're going to actually apply,
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:48.440]   so it may just go over your head.
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:52.380]   But Leviticus was never meant to be read that way.
[00:03:52.380 --> 00:03:58.480]   So even if you were the first recipients of this letter, this is not something that you
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:03.360]   just read in three chapters in one, because basically it's a law book of what you ought
[00:04:03.360 --> 00:04:04.360]   to do.
[00:04:04.360 --> 00:04:07.580]   You don't just read law books, you don't skim through it, because there might be a
[00:04:07.580 --> 00:04:14.500]   particular word or a phrase that if you don't understand it, you may get into trouble, because
[00:04:14.500 --> 00:04:15.580]   that's the law.
[00:04:15.580 --> 00:04:21.580]   So every single thing that it says, so if you've ever read a contract or entered into
[00:04:21.580 --> 00:04:28.460]   any kind of agreement or sold a house or anything, you know that those little things that are
[00:04:28.460 --> 00:04:35.700]   in there are absolutely important, and the more important it is, you know, they had dozens
[00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:41.460]   of lawyers comb through how they phrase something and the words that they use, because it has
[00:04:41.460 --> 00:04:42.460]   legal ramification.
[00:04:42.460 --> 00:04:48.860]   Well, the book of Leviticus was written with that kind of mindset, that when he said not
[00:04:48.860 --> 00:04:53.280]   to touch something, and only these people are to touch something, and this is how you
[00:04:53.280 --> 00:04:59.020]   consecrate something, you have to follow it to the letter of the law, right?
[00:04:59.020 --> 00:05:03.540]   And then the first application we see later on in Leviticus chapter 10, God told them
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:08.640]   not to put up anything strange, and then the first two priests who put up something basically
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:13.020]   ignored certain aspects of the law, and as a result of that, what happens to them?
[00:05:13.020 --> 00:05:17.460]   They get consumed, because they didn't take God's law seriously.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:21.660]   So Leviticus was never meant to be something that you just kind of skim through, you know,
[00:05:21.660 --> 00:05:25.600]   you can't just read this kind of like get a broad understanding, you really have to
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:28.340]   comb through what does this word mean?
[00:05:28.340 --> 00:05:29.580]   Why did he do this?
[00:05:29.580 --> 00:05:31.100]   What was the reason behind this?
[00:05:31.100 --> 00:05:33.300]   What were they seeing?
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:37.980]   Because that's exactly how God intended for them to apply it, every letter of the law.
[00:05:37.980 --> 00:05:43.700]   If God told only this tribe to touch the poles, anybody else touch the poles, they die.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:49.280]   If God said that your tribe is on the east side and you started camping on the left side,
[00:05:49.280 --> 00:05:51.380]   your whole tribe would have been punished.
[00:05:51.380 --> 00:05:57.700]   And so again, as we study it, we want to do our best to comb through some of the stuff
[00:05:57.700 --> 00:06:01.380]   that we can understand, some of the stuff we don't understand, but just because we don't
[00:06:01.380 --> 00:06:03.940]   understand doesn't mean there isn't meaning.
[00:06:03.940 --> 00:06:07.540]   You might not understand it this time, you may understand it next time you come around
[00:06:07.540 --> 00:06:10.380]   as you learn more about the scripture.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:16.020]   So we're going to do our best to dive into the significance of this thing, the meaning
[00:06:16.020 --> 00:06:17.640]   of the grain offering.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:22.240]   The word in itself, again, it doesn't say here, this is the meaning itself, but the
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:30.620]   word itself for grain offering is "mina," or "mina" if you want to pronounce it.
[00:06:30.620 --> 00:06:35.640]   The word "mina," it's used kind of generically.
[00:06:35.640 --> 00:06:40.920]   It doesn't specifically refer to the grain offering, but it also refers to both the animal
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.320]   sacrifice and the grain sacrifice.
[00:06:43.320 --> 00:06:48.320]   So early on in the book of Genesis, where we see the story of Cain and Abel, both of
[00:06:48.320 --> 00:06:54.820]   their offerings are called "mina," or "mina" is probably the correct way to say it.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:01.880]   So generally speaking, it means, again, it's referring to a particular type of sacrifice,
[00:07:01.880 --> 00:07:05.600]   but the word in and of itself, it means tribute.
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.080]   Again, all of these things are going to help us to understand the meaning behind this particular
[00:07:11.080 --> 00:07:12.080]   sacrifice.
[00:07:12.080 --> 00:07:17.360]   It was the money paid by a vassal king to his overlord as a mark of his continuing goodwill
[00:07:17.360 --> 00:07:20.500]   and faithfulness.
[00:07:20.500 --> 00:07:25.000]   And so the term "mina" would have been understood as a form of tribute given to the Lord as
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.560]   an acknowledgment of his lordship over them.
[00:07:28.560 --> 00:07:32.680]   So again, it doesn't say that this is the reason why you need to give it to us, but
[00:07:32.680 --> 00:07:37.040]   the word in and of itself is used that way in other parts of the scripture where someone
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:43.080]   who is subordinate is offering tribute and it's kind of a relationship between somebody
[00:07:43.080 --> 00:07:46.520]   superior to somebody who is inferior.
[00:07:46.520 --> 00:07:53.000]   And again, it is often used as if one king, let's say it's the king of Syria conquers
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:00.320]   other nations, the nation that was conquered has to pay tribute, and so their tribute basically
[00:08:00.320 --> 00:08:07.160]   is a sign of submission to whatever kingdom that rules over them.
[00:08:07.160 --> 00:08:13.000]   So that is the literal meaning of the word, and as we go through it, we're going to see
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:19.280]   that the overall meaning of this is very related to this.
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:23.900]   We see that in Deuteronomy 26, 9-10, again a portion of it, "And he brought us into this
[00:08:23.900 --> 00:08:27.000]   place and gave us this land, a land flowing with milk and honey.
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:30.920]   And behold, now I bring the first fruit of the ground which you, O Lord, have given me,
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:34.060]   and you shall set it down before the Lord, Lord your God, and worship you before the
[00:08:34.060 --> 00:08:35.060]   Lord your God."
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:40.760]   Okay, so this is not directly related to what I said, but again, this is an act of giving
[00:08:40.760 --> 00:08:44.360]   tribute to God as first fruits.
[00:08:44.360 --> 00:08:50.640]   And so when we think of giving tribute to God, like a lower kingdom to a higher kingdom,
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:59.360]   say again to Egypt or whoever conquered, we think of a context where we're forcefully
[00:08:59.360 --> 00:09:01.120]   giving.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:06.900]   But again, even though the word itself is referring to tribute, the idea in this particular
[00:09:06.900 --> 00:09:13.340]   offering is more of a dedication, a voluntary dedication.
[00:09:13.340 --> 00:09:20.500]   So the grain offering was an act of dedication and consecration to God, acknowledging Him
[00:09:20.500 --> 00:09:24.200]   as King.
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:28.640]   So it expressed not only thankfulness, but obedience and willingness to keep the law.
[00:09:28.640 --> 00:09:38.200]   So by offering this sacrifice, it was an act of acknowledging His Lordship over their lives.
[00:09:38.200 --> 00:09:45.400]   So this is the offering that is the closest related to, sorry, the burnt offering brought
[00:09:45.400 --> 00:09:49.500]   peace with the Lord, Lord God, and the grain offering was a sign of thankfulness and dedication
[00:09:49.500 --> 00:09:50.500]   to the Lord.
[00:09:50.500 --> 00:09:52.880]   So let me explain this real quick.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:58.080]   Those two offerings, the burnt offering and the grain offering, almost always was sacrificed
[00:09:58.080 --> 00:09:59.080]   together.
[00:09:59.080 --> 00:10:03.000]   So remember last time we were here, we talked about how the burnt offering was giving morning
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:06.340]   and night every single day, right?
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:11.800]   Every single day that the lamb, the bull, they were all slaughtered in the morning and
[00:10:11.800 --> 00:10:13.560]   at night, right?
[00:10:13.560 --> 00:10:17.840]   And in the burnt offering, what did they burn?
[00:10:17.840 --> 00:10:25.120]   Here's another word for burnt offering, whole offering, and what did it signify?
[00:10:25.120 --> 00:10:29.080]   What is the overall meaning of the burnt offering?
[00:10:29.080 --> 00:10:34.360]   Atonement, right?
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:40.400]   So that was the most important of all the sacrifices, and that sacrifice had to be made
[00:10:40.400 --> 00:10:46.680]   on a daily basis, and it signified that they could not be in the presence of a holy God
[00:10:46.680 --> 00:10:49.320]   without the shedding of this blood.
[00:10:49.320 --> 00:10:51.040]   And so they needed to do this over and over again.
[00:10:51.040 --> 00:10:57.800]   So when the author of Hebrews says that the sacrifice in the Old Testament were only a
[00:10:57.800 --> 00:11:02.360]   shadow of the things to come, and that these sacrifices in and of itself did not have any
[00:11:02.360 --> 00:11:06.680]   power, and so they needed to do it over and over and over and over again, where Christ
[00:11:06.680 --> 00:11:08.720]   did it once for all, finished, right?
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.040]   So the burnt offering, the other name of the burnt offering is whole offering, because
[00:11:14.040 --> 00:11:16.160]   all of it was sacrificed, right?
[00:11:16.160 --> 00:11:19.960]   It wasn't just a portion, that all of the animal, every part of it, they weren't allowed
[00:11:19.960 --> 00:11:21.560]   to touch any of it, right?
[00:11:21.560 --> 00:11:26.760]   So that burnt offering is first sacrificed, and then the grain offering is sacrificed
[00:11:26.760 --> 00:11:28.700]   afterwards, and it's almost always done.
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:32.400]   So in the morning, they would begin with a burnt offering, and then a grain offering.
[00:11:32.400 --> 00:11:37.440]   And then evening, they would do the same, burnt offering, and then a grain offering,
[00:11:37.440 --> 00:11:39.000]   okay?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:47.960]   What is the significance of these two offerings together being sacrificed?
[00:11:47.960 --> 00:11:59.360]   What are the terms that we use that seems to point to these two sacrifices?
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:09.720]   So if you call the burnt offering – somebody say sandwich?
[00:12:09.720 --> 00:12:10.720]   What did you say?
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:15.560]   Sorry, I can't hear you from there.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:17.920]   Okay, sin offering.
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:21.280]   Well, sin offering is actually coming later.
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:23.800]   There is another offering called the sin offering.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:30.520]   No, no, I'm talking about in relation to our salvation, the very first thing that happens
[00:12:30.520 --> 00:12:32.240]   is what?
[00:12:32.240 --> 00:12:33.760]   Justification.
[00:12:33.760 --> 00:12:36.480]   Okay, so that's the word.
[00:12:36.480 --> 00:12:41.480]   Reconciliation is also true, but the word I was looking for is justification, right?
[00:12:41.480 --> 00:12:43.440]   Where our sins are atoned for.
[00:12:43.440 --> 00:12:49.480]   So if our salvation begins with justification, what comes immediately, simultaneously with
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:50.480]   justification?
[00:12:50.480 --> 00:12:56.080]   Going to church?
[00:12:56.080 --> 00:12:58.400]   No.
[00:12:58.400 --> 00:13:00.400]   Joining BCC.
[00:13:00.400 --> 00:13:04.120]   Sanctification, right?
[00:13:04.120 --> 00:13:10.360]   So if the burnt offering pointed to justification, the grain offering pointed to sanctification
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:18.560]   because the grain offering was an act of dedication, of lordship, right?
[00:13:18.560 --> 00:13:22.560]   So remember in Romans chapter 12, it says in view of God's mercy.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:26.480]   Well, which mercy is he talking about?
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:29.540]   Atonement for our sins, right?
[00:13:29.540 --> 00:13:32.120]   In view of atonement for our sins, what does he say?
[00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.800]   To offer your body as a living sacrifice.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:41.240]   So that living sacrifice is an ongoing sacrifice of dedication to God, to serve him.
[00:13:41.240 --> 00:13:42.240]   Yes?
[00:13:42.240 --> 00:13:44.800]   So we would call that sanctification.
[00:13:44.800 --> 00:13:52.160]   And so this offering points to sanctification, an ongoing, repeated act of sanctification.
[00:13:52.160 --> 00:13:58.400]   So again, it doesn't spell this out, but if we were to look at the details of it today,
[00:13:58.400 --> 00:14:02.520]   I think it'll make more sense.
[00:14:02.520 --> 00:14:08.880]   And this is the offering that closely is connected to tithe, giving to the Lord to support the
[00:14:08.880 --> 00:14:09.940]   Levites in the temple.
[00:14:09.940 --> 00:14:16.180]   So what was giving in sanctification, okay, the second offering, grain offering, a portion
[00:14:16.180 --> 00:14:20.420]   of it is offered and the rest of it is to be used by the Levites, right?
[00:14:20.420 --> 00:14:25.660]   The priests were to take that, and again, the offer cannot eat it.
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:30.140]   They would take a portion of it and the rest of it was to support the temple work, right?
[00:14:30.140 --> 00:14:35.540]   And so the idea of tithing comes from this particular offering, the offering of the first
[00:14:35.540 --> 00:14:37.540]   fruits.
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:45.620]   Again, let me give you a few passages that highlight this.
[00:14:45.620 --> 00:14:49.380]   Deuteronomy 12, five through six, "But you shall seek the place that the Lord your God
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:53.020]   will choose out of your tribes to put his name and make a habitation there.
[00:14:53.020 --> 00:14:57.380]   There you shall go and there you shall bring your burnt offerings and your sacrifices,
[00:14:57.380 --> 00:15:01.580]   your tithes and contributions that you present, your vow offerings, your freewill offerings,
[00:15:01.580 --> 00:15:03.940]   and the firstborn of your herd of your flock."
[00:15:03.940 --> 00:15:07.100]   Okay, so this is in reference to this particular offering.
[00:15:07.100 --> 00:15:10.540]   And then Proverbs 3, nine through ten, "Honor the Lord with your wealth and the first fruits
[00:15:10.540 --> 00:15:12.180]   of all your produce.
[00:15:12.180 --> 00:15:16.420]   Then your barns will be filled with plenty and your vats will be bursting with wine."
[00:15:16.420 --> 00:15:21.140]   So when it's talking about first fruits of all your produce, it's referring to this particular
[00:15:21.140 --> 00:15:26.700]   offering, the grain offering.
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:34.500]   When we talk about giving and sacrificing and offering in the New Testament, the foundation
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:39.700]   comes from this particular offering.
[00:15:39.700 --> 00:15:43.660]   So the grain offering, this is the only offering that does not require an animal sacrifice
[00:15:43.660 --> 00:15:47.860]   because the offering does not atone for your sins.
[00:15:47.860 --> 00:15:51.620]   Every other offering, the burnt offering, the peace offering, the guilt offering, the
[00:15:51.620 --> 00:15:57.420]   confession offering, every single one of them are given to atone for a particular sin.
[00:15:57.420 --> 00:16:00.780]   The meaning behind these things, again, we're going to find out as we study it, but this
[00:16:00.780 --> 00:16:05.780]   particular offering is the only offering out of the five that does not require animal sacrifice
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:09.860]   because it is not offered as an atonement.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:13.900]   It was an offering of dedication.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:21.500]   Again, as I mentioned already, that this offering is always, almost always, coupled with the
[00:16:21.500 --> 00:16:23.540]   burnt offering.
[00:16:23.540 --> 00:16:31.180]   And the reason why is because you cannot have sanctification before justification.
[00:16:31.180 --> 00:16:35.500]   What is somebody who isn't justified, who is working hard to be a good person, what
[00:16:35.500 --> 00:16:39.820]   do you call that person?
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.780]   Just a good person.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:48.900]   Your moral person, your kind person, you're giving, you're a gracious person, but you're
[00:16:48.900 --> 00:16:51.700]   not a Christian.
[00:16:51.700 --> 00:16:55.180]   So sanctification must follow justification.
[00:16:55.180 --> 00:16:59.820]   That's why every time before a dedication was made, there had to be a burnt offering
[00:16:59.820 --> 00:17:02.540]   to prepare them for the dedication.
[00:17:02.540 --> 00:17:06.780]   That's why Romans chapter 12, 1 wouldn't make any sense without chapter 1 through 11.
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:11.340]   It says, "In view of this mercy, now give your life as a sacrifice."
[00:17:11.340 --> 00:17:18.580]   So you tell non-Christian, somebody who maybe sometimes even grown up in the church and
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:23.460]   is jumping through hoops and doing all these things, but his sins have never been justified,
[00:17:23.460 --> 00:17:26.160]   he doesn't really have true faith.
[00:17:26.160 --> 00:17:29.260]   He just has been cultured in the church.
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.380]   And there's a huge difference.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:39.100]   And there's so much warning in the scriptures for cultural Christianity because it is so
[00:17:39.100 --> 00:17:45.500]   deceptive, because it is so deceptive because on the surface it looks the same.
[00:17:45.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   You do the same thing.
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:52.140]   I mean, think about the Pharisees who actually even evangelized, memorized scripture, gave
[00:17:52.140 --> 00:17:54.180]   to the poor, gave to the temple.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:55.260]   They memorized the law.
[00:17:55.260 --> 00:18:00.280]   They did all of these things and yet they weren't justified.
[00:18:00.280 --> 00:18:06.380]   And so these two offerings go hand in hand because sanctification and discipleship and
[00:18:06.380 --> 00:18:17.740]   dedication and sacrifice, none of it means anything unless there's true justification.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:22.180]   Unlike the burnt offerings, only a handful of sacrifice was offered while the rest was
[00:18:22.180 --> 00:18:24.980]   saved for consumption by the priest.
[00:18:24.980 --> 00:18:28.940]   So again, the whole offering was complete dedication, right?
[00:18:28.940 --> 00:18:30.260]   Burnt offering, whole offering.
[00:18:30.260 --> 00:18:33.860]   There was nothing saved, nothing eaten.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.940]   Burnt offering that you typically follow the burnt offering, only a portion of it,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:40.540]   they call it a memorial portion, right?
[00:18:40.540 --> 00:18:45.860]   Just a token of it is burnt up and rest of it is consumed by the priest.
[00:18:45.860 --> 00:18:48.500]   Not by the offerer.
[00:18:48.500 --> 00:18:52.900]   That one comes next, the peace offering or sometimes called the fellowship offering.
[00:18:52.900 --> 00:18:54.820]   Well, this is not that offering.
[00:18:54.820 --> 00:19:04.740]   This portion is given, rest of it is for the purpose of supporting the Levites.
[00:19:04.740 --> 00:19:14.020]   Flour and oil were the main ingredients for this offering.
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:18.220]   With other sacrifices, God made it very specific.
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:22.180]   He had specific instructions on how they were to be offered.
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:27.500]   The rules governing grain offering had some flexibility.
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:30.940]   He kind of gave some rooms, like you could do it this way, you can do it that way, where
[00:19:30.940 --> 00:19:34.700]   if you look at the other offering, especially the burnt offering where the instruction is
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.420]   very clear.
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:42.460]   He even instructs them where to sacrifice, to the north side, where to get checked, right?
[00:19:42.460 --> 00:19:46.660]   He gives very specific instructions, what to touch, what you cannot touch, what to cut
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:52.860]   out, what to be offered, but in this grain offering, there's a lot of flexibility.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:57.820]   The flour could be cooked or uncooked.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:04.620]   There's three different ways that he mentions that even as you offer it, you can offer it
[00:20:04.620 --> 00:20:13.700]   in a baked in an oven, baked on a griddle, cooked on a pan.
[00:20:13.700 --> 00:20:14.700]   Why do you think this is?
[00:20:14.700 --> 00:20:18.180]   Why do you think there's so much flexibility in this offering?
[00:20:18.180 --> 00:20:30.620]   Yeah, basically it's the same ingredient.
[00:20:30.620 --> 00:20:33.540]   Why do you think there was so much flexibility?
[00:20:33.540 --> 00:20:35.780]   You don't have to answer that.
[00:20:35.780 --> 00:20:42.060]   These are questions I want you to ask as you are studying this before you come if you can.
[00:20:42.060 --> 00:20:45.100]   Instead of just reading it, ask yourself, "Why is this different?
[00:20:45.100 --> 00:20:47.700]   Why did God make him do that and not make him do that?
[00:20:47.700 --> 00:20:49.140]   What is the meaning behind that?"
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:53.980]   So if you come asking these questions, I think it'll be easier when I try to explain it to
[00:20:53.980 --> 00:20:54.980]   you.
[00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.260]   Again, it doesn't spell out and say, "This is the reason why you have flexibility," but
[00:20:59.260 --> 00:21:04.980]   if you just kind of do deductive reasoning behind the meaning of this offering and why
[00:21:04.980 --> 00:21:10.140]   they were giving it as a dedication, who was it for, I think we can see that there might
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:12.580]   be twofold explanation.
[00:21:12.580 --> 00:21:15.460]   One is, it was meant to be a free will offering.
[00:21:15.460 --> 00:21:17.660]   Sorry, erase that.
[00:21:17.660 --> 00:21:21.380]   It is not a free will offering.
[00:21:21.380 --> 00:21:24.300]   I was looking, I used that a couple times and I erased it, but I forgot to erase this
[00:21:24.300 --> 00:21:25.300]   time.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:27.020]   Okay, so just mark that off.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:32.420]   It's not a free will offering, but it was an offering dedicated for the worshippers
[00:21:32.420 --> 00:21:38.380]   as an act of gratitude with the exception of it being offering the first fruits.
[00:21:38.380 --> 00:21:39.940]   So again, I apologize.
[00:21:39.940 --> 00:21:42.020]   This is not a free will offering.
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:57.140]   This was required, but it was to be given when you desire to give.
[00:21:57.140 --> 00:22:02.440]   So because it was an offering that was meant to be eaten by the priest, so it may have
[00:22:02.440 --> 00:22:05.300]   required some flexibility of how it was cooked or for taste.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.500]   So let me just explain this real quick.
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:14.500]   So again, this is just reasoning, deduction based upon understanding of this offering.
[00:22:14.500 --> 00:22:21.380]   This offering was, one, was to be given mostly to the priest for them to eat.
[00:22:21.380 --> 00:22:28.780]   So when an offer came to give, they could have either baked it in an oven, griddle,
[00:22:28.780 --> 00:22:29.780]   or pan.
[00:22:29.780 --> 00:22:34.660]   So it was kind of a, if you really think about it, somebody prepared a meal for the
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:35.660]   Levites, right?
[00:22:35.660 --> 00:22:41.340]   Because they didn't just dump it.
[00:22:41.340 --> 00:22:43.580]   And then it could have been cooked, it could have been not cooked.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.660]   So if it's not cooked, they get an uncooked flour and oil and they can cook it themselves.
[00:22:48.660 --> 00:22:52.220]   Or they could cook it and bring it and leave a portion and then give the rest to them.
[00:22:52.220 --> 00:22:54.060]   So it would make sense.
[00:22:54.060 --> 00:22:55.060]   Yes?
[00:22:55.060 --> 00:22:56.340]   Yeah.
[00:22:56.340 --> 00:23:00.020]   So I think that's one of the reasons why there's flexibility in this offering is because
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:01.020]   it was meant to be consumed.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:07.180]   And it was kind of like somebody who took the time to cook it and say, "We're offering
[00:23:07.180 --> 00:23:11.660]   this to you, Lord, to be used by your servants."
[00:23:11.660 --> 00:23:15.240]   And secondly, it was an offering of dedication.
[00:23:15.240 --> 00:23:19.700]   So if you're going to dedicate something, it's probably better if you had some part
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:23.620]   in this dedication that you chose for yourself.
[00:23:23.620 --> 00:23:27.180]   Now how does this lead to sanctification?
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:33.140]   If you, again, just connecting it to our understanding, our application, when we think of sanctification,
[00:23:33.140 --> 00:23:40.500]   we say the Bible talks about pick up your cross and follow me, right?
[00:23:40.500 --> 00:23:43.120]   And to give generously.
[00:23:43.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   So there's a lot of imperatives in scripture.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:52.060]   But he doesn't say, "Pick up the cross and follow me," means you need to sell your house.
[00:23:52.060 --> 00:23:53.820]   You can't drive this car.
[00:23:53.820 --> 00:23:56.140]   You're going to have to go overseas.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:57.940]   You're going to have to serve the church in this way.
[00:23:57.940 --> 00:24:00.060]   It tells us to serve.
[00:24:00.060 --> 00:24:03.660]   But it doesn't spell out, "Here are 15 things that you need to do, and I want you to mark
[00:24:03.660 --> 00:24:04.660]   this off."
[00:24:04.660 --> 00:24:05.660]   It doesn't do that.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:07.260]   Remember we talked about that?
[00:24:07.260 --> 00:24:13.100]   God gave us different gifts, and everything that we do is supposed to be an act of what?
[00:24:13.100 --> 00:24:15.580]   Act of worship.
[00:24:15.580 --> 00:24:19.300]   Whether you eat or drink, do it for the glory of God.
[00:24:19.300 --> 00:24:25.300]   So a lot of times, especially if you come from a background where you're, you know,
[00:24:25.300 --> 00:24:29.540]   a lot of times if you're in a very strict discipleship group, especially in college,
[00:24:29.540 --> 00:24:32.820]   and they tell you what you're supposed to do on Friday, what you're supposed to do on
[00:24:32.820 --> 00:24:36.660]   Tuesday, you know, what to do with your money, who to date, when to date, how long you're
[00:24:36.660 --> 00:24:40.300]   supposed to date, what to wear, what not to wear, and you become very accustomed to that,
[00:24:40.300 --> 00:24:45.340]   and all of a sudden people are not telling you what to do, you feel very, like, you feel
[00:24:45.340 --> 00:24:48.700]   very strange, right?
[00:24:48.700 --> 00:24:53.380]   And so you're really good at jumping through hoops, but you don't really think through
[00:24:53.380 --> 00:24:54.700]   why you're doing it.
[00:24:54.700 --> 00:24:59.420]   And then when you do offer it up, you just do it because people told you to do it.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:05.220]   See, God doesn't want our sanctification to be just jumping through hoops, right?
[00:25:05.220 --> 00:25:10.180]   You could memorize scripture because somebody is going to make you buy boba if you don't
[00:25:10.180 --> 00:25:13.620]   do it, and you did do it, but you had no desire to do it.
[00:25:13.620 --> 00:25:18.620]   So again, don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with accountability, right?
[00:25:18.620 --> 00:25:24.020]   But the danger of just jumping through hoops, you can do that all your life without worshiping
[00:25:24.020 --> 00:25:27.900]   God once, right?
[00:25:27.900 --> 00:25:31.660]   So in this particular offering, God gives a little bit of flexibility because what God
[00:25:31.660 --> 00:25:34.820]   desires is worship, right?
[00:25:34.820 --> 00:25:37.220]   Not for you to check off the mark.
[00:25:37.220 --> 00:25:40.700]   So live in purity, serve God, be generous, right?
[00:25:40.700 --> 00:25:46.320]   Use your gifts to honor God and all of these things, but as an act of worship, right?
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:48.260]   What are you convicted in?
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:50.020]   Are you going to live your life for Christ?
[00:25:50.020 --> 00:25:54.020]   And so I believe that there's flexibility in this because of the meaning behind it.
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:59.340]   What God desires is a pleasing sacrifice, an aroma, and we're going to get to that.
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:04.180]   And that's actually a big part of this offering, right?
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:10.180]   So in this offering, he says frankincense oil was to be added to this offering.
[00:26:10.180 --> 00:26:16.660]   So when you bring the flower, make sure there is oil.
[00:26:16.660 --> 00:26:20.980]   Other places in the scripture, oil is often associated with joy.
[00:26:20.980 --> 00:26:25.540]   I think I have verses for this.
[00:26:25.540 --> 00:26:33.340]   And then again, in other places where when you see oil being burned, it describes it
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:37.660]   as sweet aroma of prayer to God, right?
[00:26:37.660 --> 00:26:42.780]   I think I have verses.
[00:26:42.780 --> 00:26:45.980]   Well, those are verses that you can look up later, okay?
[00:26:45.980 --> 00:26:52.220]   So in both instances, frankincense in particular, when they burned this, they said that it had
[00:26:52.220 --> 00:26:53.460]   a very sweet aroma.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.660]   It was a very pleasant smelling oil when it was burned, right?
[00:26:57.660 --> 00:27:02.060]   So remember we talked about that last time when they made burnt offerings?
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:08.120]   And where were the Israelites camped based upon the tabernacle?
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:10.520]   Where was the tabernacle?
[00:27:10.520 --> 00:27:12.260]   Right at the center, right?
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:16.040]   And all the tribes are equal distance from each other, right?
[00:27:16.040 --> 00:27:19.340]   And then in between them were the Levites, right?
[00:27:19.340 --> 00:27:26.340]   So you had the tribes and a Levitic tribe between them and then you had the tent, right?
[00:27:26.340 --> 00:27:31.020]   And so all the sacrifices that they made, burnt offering, you know, all the other sacrifices,
[00:27:31.020 --> 00:27:36.180]   but in particular burnt offering, they probably heard the slaughter of animals constantly.
[00:27:36.180 --> 00:27:41.900]   And if you walked into this tent, it was like a slaughterhouse, right?
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:45.540]   I mean at the slaughterhouse at the end of the day, they clean up, but you know, you're
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:50.220]   looking at dirt and you had hundreds of animals being slaughtered in this particular spot
[00:27:50.220 --> 00:27:51.420]   over and over.
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:57.020]   So there's probably, visually, they probably saw blood everywhere.
[00:27:57.020 --> 00:27:59.180]   They didn't do a good, they didn't clean it up.
[00:27:59.180 --> 00:28:01.260]   But God didn't tell them to clean up the blood.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:03.500]   He actually told them to sprinkle it everywhere.
[00:28:03.500 --> 00:28:05.980]   He wanted it to be bloodied.
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:09.140]   And all of that pointed to the blood sacrifice of Christ.
[00:28:09.140 --> 00:28:14.820]   So again, this was not a clean slaughterhouse that they cleaned and then at the end of the
[00:28:14.820 --> 00:28:16.420]   day, cleaned it up and started over.
[00:28:16.420 --> 00:28:18.020]   This is over and over again.
[00:28:18.020 --> 00:28:21.940]   Every time they use this altar, it has dried blood on it and then they sprinkle it over
[00:28:21.940 --> 00:28:23.020]   and over again.
[00:28:23.020 --> 00:28:26.140]   That was the particular scene.
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:33.140]   The altar where the animals are being sacrificed, how often was it burned?
[00:28:33.140 --> 00:28:35.460]   24/7.
[00:28:35.460 --> 00:28:37.220]   It never went out.
[00:28:37.220 --> 00:28:40.280]   There was some kind of sacrifice being offered there morning and night.
[00:28:40.280 --> 00:28:42.820]   So visually, they saw blood.
[00:28:42.820 --> 00:28:47.780]   Visually, they saw, they probably heard the animals being sacrificed constantly to constantly
[00:28:47.780 --> 00:28:51.660]   remind them of the need for sacrifice.
[00:28:51.660 --> 00:28:53.460]   And then they probably smelled.
[00:28:53.460 --> 00:28:54.460]   What did they smell?
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:58.420]   Burnt animals, right?
[00:28:58.420 --> 00:29:04.220]   But in this particular offering of frankincense, it was known to emit this particular sweet
[00:29:04.220 --> 00:29:05.420]   aroma.
[00:29:05.420 --> 00:29:12.540]   And that's how it's described, that this offering was a sweet aroma to God.
[00:29:12.540 --> 00:29:16.900]   It was an act of dedication and whenever they burned the sacrifice, there was this smell
[00:29:16.900 --> 00:29:22.780]   that went out, not only inside the tabernacle, but probably all throughout the camp.
[00:29:22.780 --> 00:29:28.700]   So they smelled the animals, they smelled barbecue, and they smelled the oil being burned.
[00:29:28.700 --> 00:29:31.200]   Constantly, morning and night.
[00:29:31.200 --> 00:29:35.280]   So if you were to imagine yourself in that camp, if you could close your eyes and imagine
[00:29:35.280 --> 00:29:39.800]   that you're in the middle of the desert and with this little tent in the middle and you
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:45.200]   hear animals being sacrificed and you draw near and you see blood everywhere, but the
[00:29:45.200 --> 00:29:48.620]   smell is barbecue and frankincense.
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:56.860]   That's probably what you were smelling 24/7.
[00:29:56.860 --> 00:30:00.440]   What is prohibited is leaven and honey.
[00:30:00.440 --> 00:30:07.680]   These two things were prohibited that you're not to bring to God.
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:13.000]   The reason behind it is, one, we see that in the Passover, in Exodus chapter 12 and
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   in chapter 13, where God says not to make sure that they eat of the unleavened bread.
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:23.280]   And what was the reason behind that, where God forbid eating of leavened bread?
[00:30:23.280 --> 00:30:26.200]   It was to act out the Passover, right?
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:27.800]   They're to run in haste.
[00:30:27.800 --> 00:30:32.080]   And it was to remind them that God delivered them in haste, in the manner in which God
[00:30:32.080 --> 00:30:33.320]   delivers Israel.
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:42.960]   So leaven, again, connected to the book of Exodus, was something that God prohibited.
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:52.120]   But the meaning behind it, rest of scripture, where yeast and honey are known for fermentation.
[00:30:52.120 --> 00:30:57.700]   So it was considered a corrupting agent.
[00:30:57.700 --> 00:31:01.080]   So if the dough touched yeast or honey, that it wasn't pure.
[00:31:01.080 --> 00:31:05.720]   So it was kind of a form of, you know, when God told them to bring a burnt offering, that
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:09.540]   it has had to be a male animal without defect.
[00:31:09.540 --> 00:31:15.240]   So when God tells them to not to add yeast or honey, it's kind of like the grain offering
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:18.960]   version of offering something to God without defect.
[00:31:18.960 --> 00:31:23.520]   Then no corrupting agent would come and corrupt that.
[00:31:23.520 --> 00:31:24.520]   Okay?
[00:31:24.520 --> 00:31:27.940]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:27.940 --> 00:31:29.580]   Okay.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:36.380]   Yeast is often referred to in the New Testament as a corrupting agent of pride, in particular
[00:31:36.380 --> 00:31:44.740]   the religious leaders.
[00:31:44.740 --> 00:31:51.260]   Honey again is described sweet in the mouth, but also had a very corrupting agent.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:57.820]   It was, again, oftentimes in the Bible uses it as honey to trap somebody, right?
[00:31:57.820 --> 00:32:02.220]   Where you're attracted to the sweet flavor, but once you put it in your mouth, it becomes
[00:32:02.220 --> 00:32:03.580]   bitter in your stomach.
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:07.700]   Remember that prophecy in the book of Revelation?
[00:32:07.700 --> 00:32:12.740]   That gigantic angel, he eats of it and it's sweet in his mouth and bitter in his stomach,
[00:32:12.740 --> 00:32:13.740]   right?
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:17.780]   It describes how the word of God came and it was so sweet, but then the effects of it
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:20.260]   was judgment, right?
[00:32:20.260 --> 00:32:22.260]   So oftentimes the Bible describes honey in that way.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:27.560]   So both of them were forbidden because it was considered a corrupting agent.
[00:32:27.560 --> 00:32:31.700]   So we see in scripture over and over again how yeast is described.
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:35.580]   Matthew 16, 6, "Yeast said to them, 'Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees
[00:32:35.580 --> 00:32:36.580]   and the Sadducees.'"
[00:32:36.580 --> 00:32:41.860]   So again, the leaven is where pride enters into them and it just completely corrupts
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.380]   them and it says to watch out.
[00:32:44.380 --> 00:32:50.500]   Everything that they do is corrupted by their motivation, what's inside of them, right?
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:56.700]   And that's how leaven was used, where leaven comes into a man and he corrupts his views,
[00:32:56.700 --> 00:33:02.940]   his motivation of why he does what he does is completely corrupted by this pride, right?
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:06.600]   Again in 1 Corinthians 5, 6-8, "Your boasting is not good.
[00:33:06.600 --> 00:33:10.980]   Do not know that a little leaven leavens the whole lump.
[00:33:10.980 --> 00:33:14.700]   Turns out the old leaven that you may be new lump as you really are unleavened.
[00:33:14.700 --> 00:33:17.500]   For Christ our Passover lamb has been sacrificed.
[00:33:17.500 --> 00:33:21.780]   Let us therefore celebrate the festival not with the old leaven, the leaven of malice
[00:33:21.780 --> 00:33:25.700]   and evil, but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth."
[00:33:25.700 --> 00:33:30.260]   So obviously if a Jew was to read this, he would have immediately referred back to this
[00:33:30.260 --> 00:33:33.360]   particular offering.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:40.340]   So again, honey and leaven was used to describe a corrupting agent, right?
[00:33:40.340 --> 00:33:43.940]   So what would that mean for us today when talking about sanctification?
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:49.380]   What is one of the greatest hindrances to our sanctification?
[00:33:49.380 --> 00:33:52.060]   It's our pride, right?
[00:33:52.060 --> 00:33:57.780]   It is our pride where we refuse to yield to God.
[00:33:57.780 --> 00:33:59.300]   We say, "Well, this is who I am.
[00:33:59.300 --> 00:34:00.300]   This is how I am.
[00:34:00.300 --> 00:34:01.740]   This is my personality.
[00:34:01.740 --> 00:34:03.380]   This is how I am."
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:08.060]   And we're not willing to yield to what the Word of God says, right?
[00:34:08.060 --> 00:34:09.060]   And that's pride.
[00:34:09.060 --> 00:34:11.500]   That's not our personality.
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:12.500]   That's not our background.
[00:34:12.500 --> 00:34:14.740]   That's just our pride, right?
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:16.820]   Being stiff-necked, right?
[00:34:16.820 --> 00:34:20.780]   So that's how the Bible describes leaven, where you kind of stiffen.
[00:34:20.780 --> 00:34:23.640]   You know, like you put a little leaven into the dough and the dough all of a sudden becomes
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:25.540]   a completely different agent, right?
[00:34:25.540 --> 00:34:26.820]   It's no longer flat.
[00:34:26.820 --> 00:34:27.980]   It just puffed up.
[00:34:27.980 --> 00:34:32.540]   And that's the imagery that we see with leaven, a little bit of pride, right?
[00:34:32.540 --> 00:34:36.020]   And you become unteachable.
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:43.820]   But it also says to add this, the salt, right?
[00:34:43.820 --> 00:34:45.460]   It's stressed in three different ways.
[00:34:45.460 --> 00:34:50.700]   So if you look at Leviticus 2, verse 13, it says, "You shall season all your grain offerings
[00:34:50.700 --> 00:34:51.700]   with salt.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:55.340]   You shall not let the salt of the covenant with your God be missing in your grain offering.
[00:34:55.340 --> 00:34:58.020]   With all your offerings, you shall offer salt."
[00:34:58.020 --> 00:35:03.020]   So if you read verse 13, you know this is important.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:04.740]   He says three separate ways.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:09.860]   Use it, make sure you offer it, and when you offer it, that the salt is not missing, make
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:12.960]   sure you have it, right?
[00:35:12.960 --> 00:35:17.780]   So it is repeated over and over again that this is a crucial part of this offering.
[00:35:17.780 --> 00:35:19.660]   He doesn't just mention it in passing.
[00:35:19.660 --> 00:35:23.020]   He emphasizes it three separate times.
[00:35:23.020 --> 00:35:27.460]   Salt has the exact opposite effect on the dough as leaven and honey, right?
[00:35:27.460 --> 00:35:31.200]   Salt prevents the offering from rotting while leaven and honey produce it.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:38.940]   And so we are described in the New Testament as a salt of the world, right?
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.140]   So Matthew 5.13, "You are the salt of the earth.
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:45.140]   If a salt loses its flavor, what good is it other than to be thrown on the ground and
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   to be trampled?"
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:47.140]   Right?
[00:35:47.140 --> 00:35:48.540]   So it has a preserving agent.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:54.740]   So how does the world experience common grace?
[00:35:54.740 --> 00:35:58.020]   Through the church, right?
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:00.540]   You think about all the disasters, and I'm not saying the Christians are the only ones
[00:36:00.540 --> 00:36:06.580]   who respond, but you think about all the humanitarian aids, Compassion International, World Vision,
[00:36:06.580 --> 00:36:10.180]   all these humanitarian aids.
[00:36:10.180 --> 00:36:13.540]   If you look at the background, I'm not saying the Christians are the only ones, but predominantly
[00:36:13.540 --> 00:36:17.940]   throughout history, who are the ones who responded?
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.900]   Christians, right?
[00:36:19.900 --> 00:36:25.700]   I think I shared this with you years ago in Indonesia when they had that big tsunami,
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:26.700]   had that huge earthquake.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:32.580]   I think it was 9.1 or 2, and at the corner of Indonesia, a city called Aceh, and it was
[00:36:32.580 --> 00:36:35.340]   completely blocked off from any Christians.
[00:36:35.340 --> 00:36:36.740]   Only Muslims can get in.
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:43.300]   And it was known as one of the heaviest concentration of militant Muslims in that area.
[00:36:43.300 --> 00:36:49.380]   When the tsunami hit, they were so desperate, and they started opening the door, and guess
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:50.660]   who came in?
[00:36:50.660 --> 00:36:51.660]   Christians.
[00:36:51.660 --> 00:36:53.140]   They came in with food.
[00:36:53.140 --> 00:36:54.940]   They came in with medical aid.
[00:36:54.940 --> 00:37:00.820]   And as a result of that, a lot of the nominal or maybe Muslims who weren't as committed
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:04.420]   began to say, "Where are our Muslim brothers?
[00:37:04.420 --> 00:37:06.820]   Why only the Christians are coming in?"
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:14.180]   Because if you look at human history, Christians serve as a preserving agent in the world,
[00:37:14.180 --> 00:37:15.180]   right?
[00:37:15.180 --> 00:37:21.020]   Humanitarian aid and charity, again, the church is not perfect.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:24.940]   We have all kinds of problems, but when you look at the totality of what the church has
[00:37:24.940 --> 00:37:28.580]   been to the world, it really has been a preserving agent.
[00:37:28.580 --> 00:37:33.060]   And that's what the Bible says that salt was, right?
[00:37:33.060 --> 00:37:37.940]   It functions as a preserving agent.
[00:37:37.940 --> 00:37:42.340]   But also, it describes a covenant with God which signifying preserving power of God's
[00:37:42.340 --> 00:37:43.340]   covenant.
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:49.660]   So if you look at Numbers 18, 19, and 2 Chronicles 13, 5, both of them describe the covenant
[00:37:49.660 --> 00:37:53.380]   as a salt covenant, right?
[00:37:53.380 --> 00:37:57.260]   So what do you think the significance would be to call God's covenant that he made with
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:38:02.300]   Israel as a salt covenant?
[00:38:02.300 --> 00:38:06.620]   Immediately you would think of preserving, right?
[00:38:06.620 --> 00:38:10.340]   Don't you think that's a really appropriate description of the covenant that God makes?
[00:38:10.340 --> 00:38:15.940]   Because the only reason why Israel is not destroyed is because God is preserving them.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.980]   The only reason why they weren't swallowed up by the Assyrians and the Babylonians and
[00:38:20.980 --> 00:38:25.900]   the Persians and the Greeks and the Romans and why they still exist, you look at the
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:31.740]   church today, the only reason why we exist with all the sin and corruption and bad doctrine
[00:38:31.740 --> 00:38:36.180]   and church division, why do we even still exist today?
[00:38:36.180 --> 00:38:39.740]   Because we are under God's salt covenant.
[00:38:39.740 --> 00:38:43.460]   God is preserving us because he said, "I will build my church and gates of Hades will
[00:38:43.460 --> 00:38:44.820]   not prevail against it."
[00:38:44.820 --> 00:38:46.780]   So his covenant preserves us.
[00:38:46.780 --> 00:38:51.620]   So this adding of the salt, right, it wasn't simply for flavor.
[00:38:51.620 --> 00:38:53.860]   I'm sure it was better with it.
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:58.740]   But the meaning behind it is that God is preserving this covenant, right?
[00:38:58.740 --> 00:39:01.520]   And that's why Israel is Israel.
[00:39:01.520 --> 00:39:03.420]   Not because they're good, but because God promised.
[00:39:03.420 --> 00:39:08.300]   He made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.860]   Again so Matthew 5, 13, "You are the salt of the earth.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:15.460]   If the salt loses its taste, how shall it be salty to be restored?
[00:39:15.460 --> 00:39:19.460]   It is no longer good for anything except to be thrown out and trampled under people's
[00:39:19.460 --> 00:39:20.460]   feet."
[00:39:20.460 --> 00:39:26.260]   Right?
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:31.460]   Numbers 18, 19, "All the holy contributions that the people of Israel present to the Lord
[00:39:31.460 --> 00:39:35.780]   I give to you and to your sons and daughters with you as a perpetual due.
[00:39:35.780 --> 00:39:41.660]   It is a covenant of salt forever before the Lord for you and for your offspring with you."
[00:39:41.660 --> 00:39:47.540]   Again, these are verses that I quote, 2 Corinthians, 2 Chronicles 13, 5, "Ought you not to know
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:52.220]   that the Lord God of Israel gave the kingship over Israel forever to David and his sons
[00:39:52.220 --> 00:39:54.740]   by a covenant of salt."
[00:39:54.740 --> 00:40:01.220]   Meaning that he's going to keep his promise, right?
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:06.060]   So the grain offering in the New Testament, so all occasions where burnt offering was
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:10.660]   offering in the New Testament was followed by grain offering, expressing dedication and
[00:40:10.660 --> 00:40:11.660]   lordship.
[00:40:11.660 --> 00:40:17.340]   So if you look at justification, sanctification always follows, right?
[00:40:17.340 --> 00:40:20.080]   Isn't that where we are now in Romans chapter 12?
[00:40:20.080 --> 00:40:22.140]   In view of God's mercy?
[00:40:22.140 --> 00:40:25.340]   Now do this, right?
[00:40:25.340 --> 00:40:32.460]   Ephesians chapter 1, 2, and 3, God's election, his pursuit, his adoption to pray that we
[00:40:32.460 --> 00:40:34.420]   would understand the depth of his love.
[00:40:34.420 --> 00:40:37.940]   And then it says in view of all of that, right?
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.420]   Walk in a manner worthy of the Lord.
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:41.100]   And then he gives the imperative.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:44.220]   So it always goes hand in hand, justification, sanctification.
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.660]   You don't have, you can't have one without the other.
[00:40:47.660 --> 00:40:52.060]   There's a lot of people in our generation walking around claiming justification and
[00:40:52.060 --> 00:40:53.060]   no sanctification.
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:58.620]   They have no desire to walk with the Lord and yet they're absolutely certain that their
[00:40:58.620 --> 00:41:01.000]   sins have been justified.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:03.060]   You do not have one without the other.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:06.020]   They go hand in hand, right?
[00:41:06.020 --> 00:41:09.680]   God didn't just free us from sin so that we can sin.
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:12.380]   He freed us from sin for what?
[00:41:12.380 --> 00:41:15.260]   For good works, right?
[00:41:15.260 --> 00:41:20.540]   He freed us from the bondage of sin, from the curse of sin that we may be able to live
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:23.660]   holy lives because we couldn't do it ourselves.
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:27.700]   So you do not have justification if there is no sanctification.
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:30.580]   We are saved by the blood of Christ and Christ alone.
[00:41:30.580 --> 00:41:34.220]   There's nothing that we do that adds to justification.
[00:41:34.220 --> 00:41:39.840]   But when justification happens, sanctification also happens, right?
[00:41:39.840 --> 00:41:44.460]   In different degrees, 30, 60, 100 fold, right?
[00:41:44.460 --> 00:41:48.100]   So you may look different to different people, but sanctification does happen.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:53.620]   So any instance when you see in the scripture where Christ paid the penalty, there is always
[00:41:53.620 --> 00:41:56.180]   now follow me, right?
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:41:58.680]   There's always now follow me.
[00:41:58.680 --> 00:42:04.700]   You can't just say, you know, I love Jesus, but I just don't love the church, right?
[00:42:04.700 --> 00:42:09.060]   I love doing Bible study, but I just, you know, prayer is just not for me.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.940]   I just want to be a good father and take care of my kids, right?
[00:42:12.940 --> 00:42:20.100]   I mean, the fundamental Christianity is he who confesses with your mouth that Jesus is
[00:42:20.100 --> 00:42:21.100]   what?
[00:42:21.100 --> 00:42:24.380]   Lord, and believes in his heart that Christ is raised from the dead, then you shall be
[00:42:24.380 --> 00:42:25.380]   saved.
[00:42:25.380 --> 00:42:27.100]   It's both, right?
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:31.140]   You have to believe in his death and resurrection, and you have to confess with your mouth that
[00:42:31.140 --> 00:42:33.180]   Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:42:33.180 --> 00:42:35.140]   They both go hand in hand, right?
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:41.180]   So whenever you see justification, sanctification follows right along, just like the way they
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:44.980]   sacrifice in the morning, burnt offering, grain offering, at night, burnt offering,
[00:42:44.980 --> 00:42:50.140]   grain offering, always.
[00:42:50.140 --> 00:42:53.500]   More specific application, the offering given in the New Testament is used to support the
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:55.580]   gospel work of the New Testament church.
[00:42:55.580 --> 00:43:00.740]   So as the grain offering was given, and a large portion of that was for the purpose
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:05.660]   of the tabernacle and the Levites to continue to do God's work, we see that offering being
[00:43:05.660 --> 00:43:12.060]   applied in the New Testament to support the gospel work, right?
[00:43:12.060 --> 00:43:14.940]   Oops, sorry.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.700]   Romans 10, 9, because if you confess with your mouth, which I just shared, let me go
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:20.700]   to the next passage.
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:35.420]   Okay, I'm just going to read 1 Peter 2, 5.
[00:43:35.420 --> 00:43:39.020]   Be yourself like living stones are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:46.660]   to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Christ Jesus.
[00:43:46.660 --> 00:43:53.420]   Again, the last part that I was sharing, 1 Corinthians 9, 9-14.
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:59.320]   For as written in the law of Moses, you should not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain.
[00:43:59.320 --> 00:44:01.420]   Is it for oxen that God is concerned?
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:03.220]   Does he not speak entirely for our sake?
[00:44:03.220 --> 00:44:07.620]   It was written for our sake because the plowman should plow in hope and the thresher thresh
[00:44:07.620 --> 00:44:09.740]   in hope of sharing in the crop.
[00:44:09.740 --> 00:44:11.000]   So let me stop right there.
[00:44:11.000 --> 00:44:14.700]   So what he's referring to here is the grain offering, is a dedication offering.
[00:44:14.700 --> 00:44:16.640]   Let me keep reading.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:20.380]   If we have sown spiritual things among you, is it too much that if we reap material things
[00:44:20.380 --> 00:44:21.380]   among you?
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.700]   If others share the rightful claim on you, do not we even more nevertheless we have not
[00:44:25.700 --> 00:44:27.780]   made use of this right?
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:32.780]   But we endure anything rather than put an obstacle in the way of the gospel of Christ.
[00:44:32.780 --> 00:44:37.060]   Do you not know that those who are employed in the temple service get their food from
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:40.980]   the temple and those who serve at the altar shall share in the sacrificial offering?
[00:44:40.980 --> 00:44:43.740]   So again, he's referring to the grain offering here.
[00:44:43.740 --> 00:44:47.580]   In the same way, the Lord commanded that those who proclaim the gospel should get their living
[00:44:47.580 --> 00:44:48.580]   by the gospel.
[00:44:48.580 --> 00:44:52.740]   So again, this is a, again, when we talk about the application of the grain offering in the
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:56.740]   New Testament, it's to support the gospel work, right?
[00:44:56.740 --> 00:45:00.660]   Through our tithing and through our giving, through supporting missionaries, through,
[00:45:00.660 --> 00:45:03.280]   you know, supporting the Indian pastors.
[00:45:03.280 --> 00:45:04.660]   And so this is the application of that.
[00:45:04.660 --> 00:45:12.540]   It's part of, a big part of sanctification in the New Testament is sacrifice, again,
[00:45:12.540 --> 00:45:14.700]   and giving for the gospel work.
[00:45:14.700 --> 00:45:16.460]   First Timothy 5, 17, 18.
[00:45:16.460 --> 00:45:20.180]   That the elders who rule well be considered worthy of double honor, especially those who
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:22.060]   labor in preaching and teaching.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:26.100]   For their scripture says, "You shall not muzzle an ox when it treads out the grain," and the
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.460]   labor deserves its wages.
[00:45:27.460 --> 00:45:31.780]   Again, this is referring to this particular offering, okay?
[00:45:31.780 --> 00:45:37.980]   So so much of the New Testament language, it is based upon what we see in the Old Testament,
[00:45:37.980 --> 00:45:38.980]   right?
[00:45:38.980 --> 00:45:44.800]   And so when we understand the Old Testament sacrifices, you can see that when Paul says
[00:45:44.800 --> 00:45:49.460]   what he says here, this is not new, right?
[00:45:49.460 --> 00:45:51.580]   Paul doesn't say anything new.
[00:45:51.580 --> 00:45:57.220]   He said the mystery was hidden and he made it clear, but it wasn't hidden where nobody
[00:45:57.220 --> 00:45:59.340]   knew, right?
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:03.820]   So the more you study the book of Leviticus and numbers and the prophecies, you see that
[00:46:03.820 --> 00:46:09.980]   everything, even the vocabulary that is used by apostles in the New Testament was all connected
[00:46:09.980 --> 00:46:10.980]   to the Old Testament.
[00:46:10.980 --> 00:46:16.820]   So the one, a Jew, think about it, for hundreds and hundreds of years, all of these things
[00:46:16.820 --> 00:46:21.100]   were not just something that somebody said, that the once a week they went to the temple
[00:46:21.100 --> 00:46:24.100]   and a pastor gave a sermon and then they went back.
[00:46:24.100 --> 00:46:27.380]   They smelled this.
[00:46:27.380 --> 00:46:29.900]   They saw it with their eyes.
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:30.900]   They touched it.
[00:46:30.900 --> 00:46:36.500]   They, they had to make the sacrifices and it was constantly in their camp, their feasts,
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:43.620]   the sacrifice, their, their, you know, their holidays, everything about the Jewish community
[00:46:43.620 --> 00:46:46.700]   was about the preparation for the coming of Christ.
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:54.060]   So imagine after seeing this, after God preparing them, I mean, we only looked at two sacrifices,
[00:46:54.060 --> 00:46:58.820]   I mean, we just started the book of Leviticus, right?
[00:46:58.820 --> 00:47:04.940]   Every, every single one of this chapter is to get them prepared for the coming of Christ.
[00:47:04.940 --> 00:47:10.320]   So imagine God doing this with the nation of Israel for hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[00:47:10.320 --> 00:47:18.180]   of hundreds of years, and Jesus comes and they say, and they don't recognize it.
[00:47:18.180 --> 00:47:24.940]   If you've ever tried to teach somebody, whether it's Sunday school or your kids, you know,
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:30.100]   and I remember when Jeremy was, I forgot how old he was, he was like three or four, and
[00:47:30.100 --> 00:47:36.660]   I tried to teach him the letter C. He got A, B, D, E, he got everything, but he, I don't
[00:47:36.660 --> 00:47:40.820]   know why every time he saw C, he would say something else.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.940]   And I was starting losing it.
[00:47:42.940 --> 00:47:43.940]   He'd be like, C!
[00:47:43.940 --> 00:47:52.100]   And he just couldn't say C, and Esther was like pulling me back, like, he's just three.
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:56.980]   I know, but this is just C, like, why couldn't he just get the C, right?
[00:47:56.980 --> 00:48:00.980]   Just how frustrating it was, because I tried so hard to get him to say C, he couldn't say
[00:48:00.980 --> 00:48:07.700]   C. So can you imagine that God did this with the nation of Israel to prepare for the coming
[00:48:07.700 --> 00:48:15.180]   of Christ, and then Christ stands right before them, and they don't recognize him?
[00:48:15.180 --> 00:48:18.220]   You know what I was thinking about this week?
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:25.980]   Where the Jews demand signs and the Greeks desire wisdom, and they want to see the power
[00:48:25.980 --> 00:48:28.180]   of God, and I was just meditating.
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:32.460]   I forgot what triggered it, but I was just thinking today, you know, the greatest power
[00:48:32.460 --> 00:48:37.340]   that God demonstrated is what he didn't do.
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:42.020]   You think of moving mountains and creating, like, yeah, all of that required power.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:48.060]   But I was just thinking, like, how much power it must have taken for him not to destroy
[00:48:48.060 --> 00:48:51.580]   us.
[00:48:51.580 --> 00:48:54.460]   You ever get so angry that you just couldn't contain yourself?
[00:48:54.460 --> 00:49:00.220]   I mean, if you just, if you see what he was doing with the nation of Israel, just how
[00:49:00.220 --> 00:49:04.820]   patient he was, and how many times he forgives their sins and restores them, and over and
[00:49:04.820 --> 00:49:12.420]   over sends his prophet, kills the prophets that he sends to restore them, over and over,
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:17.100]   and then they end up killing Jesus?
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:22.420]   And I was just thinking, meditating this week, you know, like, it must have required tremendous
[00:49:22.420 --> 00:49:29.060]   power for him to not to just slap his hand, just destroy it all.
[00:49:29.060 --> 00:49:32.140]   Like, that's enough.
[00:49:32.140 --> 00:49:36.740]   And I was just thinking, like, God's greatest demonstration of power was what he didn't
[00:49:36.740 --> 00:49:39.580]   do, right?
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:41.100]   What he didn't do.
[00:49:41.100 --> 00:49:44.260]   The fact that you and I are here, right?
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:46.660]   We're just beginning the book of Leviticus.
[00:49:46.660 --> 00:49:53.460]   Every single one of this stuff is to get us ready for Christ, right?
[00:49:53.460 --> 00:49:56.240]   And then I think about us.
[00:49:56.240 --> 00:50:02.180]   I think about how much access we have to the Word of God.
[00:50:02.180 --> 00:50:08.540]   We have access to guys like, I mean, world-renowned pastors that we can just click of a button
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.540]   on the internet.
[00:50:09.540 --> 00:50:14.620]   Like, you know, one of my favorite preachers is Martin Lloyd-Jones, who doesn't even, he's
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:19.380]   been dead for decades and decades, and I can still click a button and hear him anytime
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:20.380]   I want in the middle of the night.
[00:50:20.380 --> 00:50:22.740]   I mean, just the access that we have, right?
[00:50:22.740 --> 00:50:28.660]   The fellowship, air-conditioned room, bills paid, right?
[00:50:28.660 --> 00:50:29.660]   Food to eat.
[00:50:29.660 --> 00:50:36.240]   I mean, we have everything we could possibly need to come to God, and then our greatest
[00:50:36.240 --> 00:50:42.780]   struggle is nominalism, not caring.
[00:50:42.780 --> 00:50:49.040]   And I think about how much restraint that it takes for him to persevere with us.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:53.840]   And the only reason why he perseveres with us is because the blood sacrifice of Jesus
[00:50:53.840 --> 00:51:02.600]   Christ, because his suffering covers us over these sins.
[00:51:02.600 --> 00:51:08.240]   I forgot what triggered that thought this week, but even as I was studying this, I was
[00:51:08.240 --> 00:51:13.640]   thinking, "Wow, this is what he was doing.
[00:51:13.640 --> 00:51:18.680]   This is how much time, effort, and energy he put into preparation for coming to Christ."
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:26.160]   So therefore, when we come to the New Testament, how can we escape if we neglect such a great
[00:51:26.160 --> 00:51:27.160]   salvation?
[00:51:27.160 --> 00:51:29.480]   Neglect, not reject, neglect.
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:33.440]   And I pray that that would not be the case.
[00:51:33.440 --> 00:51:40.360]   As we study the book of Leviticus, at least recognize, at least recognize what it is that
[00:51:40.360 --> 00:51:42.720]   you have in Christ, right?
[00:51:42.720 --> 00:51:46.100]   That we may live in view of this mercy.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:54.060]   So the discussion questions for today, what are you the most thankful for today, specifically?
[00:51:54.060 --> 00:51:57.400]   In what way do you express your gratitude to God for what you are thankful for, other
[00:51:57.400 --> 00:51:59.460]   than how you feel?
[00:51:59.460 --> 00:52:03.220]   So this was kind of a Thanksgiving offering, an offering of dedication.
[00:52:03.220 --> 00:52:08.240]   So is our Thanksgiving just how we feel, and do we just sing louder on Sunday?
[00:52:08.240 --> 00:52:11.660]   Is there a very specific way that you give Thanksgiving to God?
[00:52:11.660 --> 00:52:16.260]   Because this offering was very tangible, right?
[00:52:16.260 --> 00:52:18.180]   So how do you do that?
[00:52:18.180 --> 00:52:19.180]   What should you do?
[00:52:19.180 --> 00:52:23.780]   Number two, how is lordship reflected in the way that you handle finances?
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:25.960]   Does it reflect lordship, right?
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:29.180]   You can give without reflecting lordship, right?
[00:52:29.180 --> 00:52:31.100]   And that's why God required a tenth.
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:33.100]   Again, a tenth was not all.
[00:52:33.100 --> 00:52:37.380]   Tenth was a dedication that rest of it also belongs to God, right?
[00:52:37.380 --> 00:52:40.500]   So every once in a while, you're going to read an article that says, you know, "I stopped
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:46.100]   giving tenth," and then you might just read the title and then just move on and say, "Yeah,
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:47.220]   me too."
[00:52:47.220 --> 00:52:49.200]   Click that button and read that article.
[00:52:49.200 --> 00:52:50.200]   See what it says.
[00:52:50.200 --> 00:52:54.960]   Ten out of ten times, what he's saying is, it's not tenth.
[00:52:54.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   It's all.
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:59.440]   Tenth is just a dedication, right?
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:04.780]   So the way we handle our finances, does it represent lordship in our life?
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:09.760]   And then the third practical is, outside of work, what do you think you spend the most
[00:53:09.760 --> 00:53:12.580]   time doing day to day and week to week?
[00:53:12.580 --> 00:53:14.900]   How is lordship expressed in the way that you spend your time?
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:20.620]   Do you tend to see time spent at church enough, or is Christ Lord over all your time, right?
[00:53:20.620 --> 00:53:25.980]   And you say, "You know, I go to church Wednesday and Sunday, and that's probably more than,
[00:53:25.980 --> 00:53:29.620]   you know, a lot of nominal Christians, so I get to – the rest of it is mine to do
[00:53:29.620 --> 00:53:31.100]   whatever I want," right?
[00:53:31.100 --> 00:53:33.460]   That's not lordship.
[00:53:33.460 --> 00:53:40.040]   If you pick and choose what to give and what not to give, that's not lordship, right?
[00:53:40.040 --> 00:53:42.720]   Lordship is when it is all dedicated to God.
[00:53:42.720 --> 00:53:44.520]   It all belongs to Him.
[00:53:44.520 --> 00:53:48.320]   It doesn't mean that you can't have fun, you can't take vacation, but that needs to
[00:53:48.320 --> 00:53:50.360]   be applied in every aspect of our lives.
[00:53:50.360 --> 00:53:54.720]   So the two most tangible way that we can see lordship is the way you spend your money,
[00:53:54.720 --> 00:53:57.680]   the way you spend your time.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   It does matter, because it is not your life to live anymore.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:04.760]   Our life is hidden with Christ.
[00:54:04.760 --> 00:54:08.460]   When He comes in glory, we will also be glorified with Him.
[00:54:08.460 --> 00:54:11.600]   So God says, "I have purchased you, now you are mine."
[00:54:11.600 --> 00:54:16.620]   This grain offering reminds us that we belong to Him, right?
[00:54:16.620 --> 00:54:21.300]   So how we spend our time, how we spend our money, needs to reflect that, that we've
[00:54:21.300 --> 00:54:23.960]   been purchased by the blood of Christ, that it belongs to Him.
[00:54:23.960 --> 00:54:26.480]   It is not for me to use any way I want.
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:32.160]   What does that have to do with lordship of Christ, right?
[00:54:32.160 --> 00:54:34.720]   Can you feel uncomfortable?
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.160]   It should, right?
[00:54:37.160 --> 00:54:43.440]   Because these are questions that we should really dig into our lives and ask ourselves.
[00:54:43.440 --> 00:54:49.480]   The things that I am pursuing, the things that I've held dearly in my heart, every free
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:54.040]   time I get, I'm so eager to do something, but it has nothing to do with God.
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:58.520]   These are things that we need to consider carefully to establish lordship in every aspect
[00:54:58.520 --> 00:54:59.520]   of our lives.
[00:54:59.520 --> 00:55:03.120]   So if you're here for us, then I'll have you guys get into your small room, take some
[00:55:03.120 --> 00:55:05.320]   time to discuss.
[00:55:05.320 --> 00:55:13.400]   Gracious Father, we ask for your continued patience and grace.
[00:55:13.400 --> 00:55:20.920]   We desire to be genuine followers, not simply out of obligation or burden, but in light
[00:55:20.920 --> 00:55:25.120]   of what you have done.
[00:55:25.120 --> 00:55:33.680]   Knowing Father God that the day that we met you was not the day that you knew us, that
[00:55:33.680 --> 00:55:41.720]   from the beginning of time, how you knew us, pursued us, knowing all our failures, our
[00:55:41.720 --> 00:55:47.960]   past, present, future rebellion, that despite all of these things, Lord God, how you continue
[00:55:47.960 --> 00:55:51.040]   to call us to come to you.
[00:55:51.040 --> 00:55:59.600]   I pray that that truth would overwhelm us, that we would give you this grain offering,
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:07.760]   Lord God, as an act of dedication, thankfulness, of lordship, to express our love for you,
[00:56:07.760 --> 00:56:11.200]   Father, for what you are and what you have done.
[00:56:11.200 --> 00:56:18.360]   I pray, Father, that whatever it is that we are holding onto dearly, afraid, maybe because
[00:56:18.360 --> 00:56:26.000]   of unbelief, maybe because of immaturity, maybe because we've hardened our hearts against
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:32.820]   you, maybe because of a particular sin, Lord God, that we are cherishing.
[00:56:32.820 --> 00:56:37.400]   I pray that you would anoint and bless this time, Lord, that we would be honest and open,
[00:56:37.400 --> 00:56:44.480]   not just to share our weaknesses, but to confess that we truly may repent and come to you,
[00:56:44.480 --> 00:56:49.280]   knowing, Father God, that you are our only hope, you are our only strength.
[00:56:49.280 --> 00:56:51.800]   So for that end, we pray that you would anoint and bless this time.
[00:56:51.800 --> 00:56:53.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:56:53.480 --> 00:56:55.480]   Thanks for listening.
