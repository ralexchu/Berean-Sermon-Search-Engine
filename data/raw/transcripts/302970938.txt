[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.320]   All right, Romans chapter 16, I'm going to be reading from verse 21 down to verse 24,
[00:00:10.320 --> 00:00:12.080]   reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:21.040]   "Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you, and so do Lucius and Jason and Sosipater, my kinsmen.
[00:00:21.040 --> 00:00:24.600]   I, Tertius, who write this letter, greet you in the Lord.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.880]   Gaius, host to me and to the whole church, greets you.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.160]   Erastus, the city treasurer, greets you.
[00:00:30.160 --> 00:00:34.440]   And Quartus, the brother, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all.
[00:00:34.440 --> 00:00:35.440]   Amen."
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:38.560]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:00:38.560 --> 00:00:42.200]   We thank you so much, Lord God, for the rest and the time that we've had with family and
[00:00:42.200 --> 00:00:44.240]   friends this week.
[00:00:44.240 --> 00:00:50.680]   We thank you, Father God, for giving us time, Lord, to reflect upon your grace as we do
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:59.120]   every single week, but especially, Lord God, as we took time to remember, to be thankful,
[00:00:59.120 --> 00:01:04.400]   Lord God, not just the temporal things, Lord, that you've given us, but eternal things,
[00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.240]   especially, Lord, the hope that we have in Christ can never be shaken.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:13.200]   And so for that, we ask, Lord, that you would remind us again of who you are, that our lives,
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:16.160]   Lord, may be aligned to who you are and your grace.
[00:01:16.160 --> 00:01:18.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:18.440 --> 00:01:19.440]   Amen.
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:23.760]   Again, if you're visiting us for the first time, you might look at this and say, "This
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.320]   guy's going to preach out of this?"
[00:01:25.320 --> 00:01:26.320]   Right?
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.400]   You'd like a bunch of names, right?
[00:01:28.400 --> 00:01:29.960]   Is this, is he serious?
[00:01:29.960 --> 00:01:36.120]   Typically, again, when we study the Bible, we go through these names or we go to genealogies
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:39.640]   and it's easy for us to just kind of skim over that because there's a bunch of names
[00:01:39.640 --> 00:01:42.280]   and majority of them we don't know much about.
[00:01:42.280 --> 00:01:46.280]   And what can we possibly say about the people?
[00:01:46.280 --> 00:01:51.880]   In fact, there's quite a few things that are in there that, again, we won't even have time
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:54.480]   to really unpack all of it.
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.720]   Of course, Paul doesn't say it in the letter, but looking at the type of people or who that
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.200]   was following him, the work, it says a lot about the background information of the gospel
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   ministry.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.520]   We saw in the first list that Paul mentioned in the earlier part of the chapter that these
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:15.680]   are people he's saying, these are first Christians, first Roman Christians that he was writing
[00:02:15.680 --> 00:02:17.240]   to say and greet these people.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.480]   And we talked about when we were going through that list, they were most likely the first
[00:02:21.480 --> 00:02:23.040]   martyrs of Rome.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:28.080]   So all the pictures and videos and movie scenes that you've seen of Christians being dragged
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.480]   into the Colosseum, being torn apart by lions.
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:34.800]   I mean, the list of names that we saw in chapter 16 were probably the first group of people
[00:02:34.800 --> 00:02:36.280]   who experienced that.
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:40.160]   The second group of people that we're looking at is Paul saying that these are my fellow
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:41.200]   workers.
[00:02:41.200 --> 00:02:44.120]   So the first is saying, say hi to them.
[00:02:44.120 --> 00:02:47.200]   And then now he's ending the letter saying, these people who are with me are saying hi
[00:02:47.200 --> 00:02:48.280]   to you.
[00:02:48.280 --> 00:02:50.680]   So we want to look at that list.
[00:02:50.680 --> 00:02:56.080]   And one of the first things that we see is that Paul and the other apostles were not
[00:02:56.080 --> 00:02:57.880]   alone.
[00:02:57.880 --> 00:02:59.400]   They were countless number.
[00:02:59.400 --> 00:03:02.760]   We don't know how many, and I don't know if we can say thousands, but at least in the
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:10.080]   hundreds, people who were alongside these apostles doing work, carrying the letters,
[00:03:10.080 --> 00:03:16.520]   running errands, sometimes just being an encouragement to them, providing for them financially.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:20.800]   And there was a lot of background work that was happening in order for Apostle Paul to
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:24.720]   do what God called him to do.
[00:03:24.720 --> 00:03:29.720]   I want to take some time this morning, just again, not just unpacking every single person
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:33.720]   here because we don't have detailed information about every single person on this list.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:36.200]   Some are obvious, like Timothy.
[00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.300]   And then there are some people here that we don't know anything about other than the fact
[00:03:39.300 --> 00:03:41.160]   that they're mentioned in this letter.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:49.280]   But one of the things that I want to highlight for us in this text is that how much support
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:50.280]   that Paul has.
[00:03:50.280 --> 00:03:51.600]   And there's so many people.
[00:03:51.600 --> 00:03:57.240]   There's a far greater number of people who gave their lives and sacrificed much in their
[00:03:57.240 --> 00:03:59.820]   lives in order for this gospel to spread.
[00:03:59.820 --> 00:04:01.880]   It wasn't just Apostle Paul.
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:07.360]   In fact, majority, I would say probably 99% of the people who labor for Christ, when they
[00:04:07.360 --> 00:04:10.160]   died, they just died.
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:11.560]   There was no veneration.
[00:04:11.560 --> 00:04:15.000]   There's no books written about them, other than the fact that their names are mentioned
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:18.400]   and some of them only in this text one time.
[00:04:18.400 --> 00:04:22.960]   No one knows anything about them, but they played a significant role in the spreading
[00:04:22.960 --> 00:04:25.360]   of the gospel.
[00:04:25.360 --> 00:04:30.200]   The reason why this is so important is because we have a tendency to gravitate toward the
[00:04:30.200 --> 00:04:33.000]   spectacular.
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.840]   Whenever we hear men and women who have done great things, we have a tendency to venerate
[00:04:37.840 --> 00:04:42.440]   them and we venerate them to the point where we begin to share their stories and testimonies
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:47.800]   and then eventually they become people that are beyond human.
[00:04:47.800 --> 00:04:52.000]   I've heard stories when I was younger about Martin Luther, not Martin Luther King, but
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:57.920]   Martin Luther Jr., how he was such a man of prayer and how he preached six times a day
[00:04:57.920 --> 00:05:00.840]   and he prayed four hours every single day.
[00:05:00.840 --> 00:05:06.120]   He woke up at three and he prayed and then when he was busy, he prayed even longer.
[00:05:06.120 --> 00:05:09.880]   I remember as a young Christian listening to that, I said, "Wow, that's really challenging."
[00:05:09.880 --> 00:05:14.480]   But all at the same time, the back of my mind is like, "When did this guy ever eat?
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:17.360]   Did he ever have any relationships with people?
[00:05:17.360 --> 00:05:18.640]   How did he study the Bible?
[00:05:18.640 --> 00:05:21.240]   How did he prepare for these six sermons?"
[00:05:21.240 --> 00:05:26.800]   As time went by, as I got older and I started experiencing Christian life, I began to realize
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:28.640]   that that's our natural tendency.
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.000]   We tend to venerate people that we honor and then eventually the stories get exaggerated
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:37.720]   and it gets to a point where they're just people that we honor from a distance, but
[00:05:37.720 --> 00:05:41.200]   they're not real people.
[00:05:41.200 --> 00:05:47.520]   The gospel has been spreading through real people like you and me.
[00:05:47.520 --> 00:05:54.920]   In fact, majority of the people that we venerate, if you take a real closer look at the missionaries,
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:06:00.880]   at the famous pastors, you will eventually find some flaw just like you do with any human
[00:06:00.880 --> 00:06:01.880]   being.
[00:06:01.880 --> 00:06:08.560]   Typically, the people we venerate and we honor are people from distances, people in history
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:13.920]   that we can't closely examine, just things that we've highlighted in their lives.
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:21.260]   But the reality is that God uses flawed people, common, ordinary people to accomplish very
[00:06:21.260 --> 00:06:26.920]   spectacular things.
[00:06:26.920 --> 00:06:33.520]   The tension that you and I live in is that most of us eventually will get a nine to five
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:34.520]   job.
[00:06:34.520 --> 00:06:37.120]   The majority of us will get a nine to five job.
[00:06:37.120 --> 00:06:39.840]   You're not going to be movie stars.
[00:06:39.840 --> 00:06:44.200]   99.9999% aren't going to be NBA stars.
[00:06:44.200 --> 00:06:45.200]   You're not going to win the lottery.
[00:06:45.200 --> 00:06:46.800]   You're not going to invent the next Facebook.
[00:06:46.800 --> 00:06:50.480]   You're not going to be the president of the United States or the governor.
[00:06:50.480 --> 00:06:51.960]   Everybody has dreams when they're younger.
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:55.800]   And then eventually you graduate and you realize your life begins to look a lot like what your
[00:06:55.800 --> 00:07:00.480]   parents' life looked like when you saw them at that age.
[00:07:00.480 --> 00:07:05.220]   And then you kind of go through a crisis, especially as a Christian.
[00:07:05.220 --> 00:07:10.720]   When you begin to look like that and your life begins to emulate or start to look like
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:17.160]   what you saw, you begin to ask yourself, "Is this it?"
[00:07:17.160 --> 00:07:22.400]   And then in order to compensate for that, we go on missions sometimes.
[00:07:22.400 --> 00:07:23.400]   We want to do great things.
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.400]   We want to make a mark.
[00:07:24.400 --> 00:07:25.860]   We want to go into ministry.
[00:07:25.860 --> 00:07:29.740]   And so we experience short-term missions or we experience doing this and that.
[00:07:29.740 --> 00:07:33.360]   But even then, it only lives for a short period.
[00:07:33.360 --> 00:07:38.120]   So there's a lot of people who go on mission trips, whether it's five months, a year, or
[00:07:38.120 --> 00:07:41.680]   even one time, they come back and they have a hard time adjusting back because they look
[00:07:41.680 --> 00:07:46.400]   at that life and say, "Well, that was great, but this is not."
[00:07:46.400 --> 00:07:47.640]   And then you live with that tension.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:53.800]   How do I live a spectacular life of Christ in the mundane things?
[00:07:53.800 --> 00:07:55.560]   A lot of college students experience that.
[00:07:55.560 --> 00:08:00.400]   When you graduate, your college life was so great.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.360]   You were constantly meeting up with people.
[00:08:02.360 --> 00:08:06.280]   You're surrounded by non-Christians and in small group Bible study mentoring.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:07.280]   You knew who your leaders were.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:09.080]   You knew who your followers are.
[00:08:09.080 --> 00:08:10.480]   You didn't have a nine-to-five job.
[00:08:10.480 --> 00:08:14.720]   So your life looked like a mission field on a day-to-day.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:17.440]   It was not that hard to stay sober in that context.
[00:08:17.440 --> 00:08:21.720]   And all of a sudden, you graduate and you get a nine-to-five job and it begins to look
[00:08:21.720 --> 00:08:24.720]   very mundane.
[00:08:24.720 --> 00:08:28.160]   And then you begin to ask yourself, "Is this it?
[00:08:28.160 --> 00:08:30.240]   Maybe God called me for missions.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:32.520]   Maybe God called me to do this and do that."
[00:08:32.520 --> 00:08:37.180]   And then you live with this tension of discontent because your life now doesn't look like what
[00:08:37.180 --> 00:08:43.080]   you thought it would look like if you were faithful to God.
[00:08:43.080 --> 00:08:48.920]   If you take a closer look at the Scripture, we tend to highlight the spectacular.
[00:08:48.920 --> 00:08:52.520]   Jesus walks on the water and he does spectacular things for three years.
[00:08:52.520 --> 00:08:58.600]   But for 30 years, he lived as a carpenter, learning, going to the temple.
[00:08:58.600 --> 00:09:03.840]   It says that he grew in knowledge and in favor of God, just like any other human being.
[00:09:03.840 --> 00:09:04.840]   He was a carpenter.
[00:09:04.840 --> 00:09:07.360]   I've heard sermons, people saying, "Oh, Jesus was a carpenter."
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:14.920]   So you can imagine that every table he made was perfect because he was God.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:20.120]   The Bible says that in every way he was just like us, except he didn't sin.
[00:09:20.120 --> 00:09:23.760]   So making an imperfect table doesn't make you a sinner.
[00:09:23.760 --> 00:09:30.160]   So I have a feeling Jesus made imperfect tables, just like the rest of us.
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:33.520]   I had a feeling that his measurements weren't 100%.
[00:09:33.520 --> 00:09:35.800]   He just didn't sin.
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:40.000]   But for 30 years, he lived an average life where we don't know much about him.
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:43.920]   Nothing is written about him because no one was keeping tabs on him.
[00:09:43.920 --> 00:09:50.800]   30 years, he lived a normal life, just like everybody else, paying their bills.
[00:09:50.800 --> 00:09:55.040]   And then even the very first miracle that he performs, he's at a wedding and he turns
[00:09:55.040 --> 00:09:56.600]   water into wine.
[00:09:56.600 --> 00:09:58.640]   He's not walking on the water.
[00:09:58.640 --> 00:09:59.640]   He's not talking to the storm.
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:01.340]   He doesn't raise somebody from the dead.
[00:10:01.340 --> 00:10:03.760]   He just turns water into wine.
[00:10:03.760 --> 00:10:07.600]   He just ran out of wine and people were thirsty.
[00:10:07.600 --> 00:10:10.320]   And his mom says, "Hey, can you do something?"
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:11.320]   And he does it.
[00:10:11.320 --> 00:10:12.320]   Nothing spectacular.
[00:10:12.320 --> 00:10:16.160]   It's just in the context of his life.
[00:10:16.160 --> 00:10:20.720]   His first miracle reflected more of his first 30 years than the next three years of his
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:21.720]   life.
[00:10:21.720 --> 00:10:25.840]   But we have a tendency to look at the next three years and we want to emulate that.
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:30.320]   We want to look at Apostle Paul going and planting churches, and then we want to emulate
[00:10:30.320 --> 00:10:31.320]   that.
[00:10:31.320 --> 00:10:34.240]   We want to emulate people who've given their lives and died and people wrote books about
[00:10:34.240 --> 00:10:35.800]   them, and then we want to emulate that.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:41.280]   But when our life begins to look mundane, what do we do with that?
[00:10:41.280 --> 00:10:47.920]   D.A. Carson wrote a book, a biography about his father, and the title of that book is
[00:10:47.920 --> 00:10:51.440]   called Ordinary Pastor.
[00:10:51.440 --> 00:10:54.320]   And the whole book is very ordinary.
[00:10:54.320 --> 00:10:59.680]   It's about his dad who just served the small church faithfully all his life and how much
[00:10:59.680 --> 00:11:03.360]   impact it made in his life, but there's nothing.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.720]   You read that book and even as I was reading the book, Ordinary Pastor, I was waiting for
[00:11:07.720 --> 00:11:08.720]   the punchline.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:12.960]   It was just very ordinary.
[00:11:12.960 --> 00:11:16.000]   His dad sounded a lot like my dad.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.160]   Came into ministry, planted churches, and for the most part experienced a lot of struggles,
[00:11:20.160 --> 00:11:22.360]   and then he passed away.
[00:11:22.360 --> 00:11:28.360]   So my memory of my dad is just a faithful man who was faithful all his life until his
[00:11:28.360 --> 00:11:31.480]   deathbed and the end.
[00:11:31.480 --> 00:11:41.520]   God uses ordinary people in mundane situations, day after day, year after year, life after
[00:11:41.520 --> 00:11:42.720]   life.
[00:11:42.720 --> 00:11:48.480]   And that's how majority of the gospel ministry has been spreading all this time.
[00:11:48.480 --> 00:11:53.000]   It wasn't one guy who picked up his cross and did spectacular things.
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:58.360]   It was a wife who was staying home, faithfully preaching the gospel to their children.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:05.120]   It was a pastor pastoring small churches that nobody knew outside of their own small churches.
[00:12:05.120 --> 00:12:09.940]   It's faithful college students who are sharing the faith with their classmates.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:13.820]   Somebody becomes a Christian and then begins to share the gospel with mom and dad and brother
[00:12:13.820 --> 00:12:18.700]   and sister or a co-worker who invites people out to their churches.
[00:12:18.700 --> 00:12:21.400]   And so much of the gospel is being spread in that context.
[00:12:21.400 --> 00:12:25.960]   In fact, majority of you, if I asked you how you came to faith, you didn't see a light
[00:12:25.960 --> 00:12:28.160]   from the sky.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:31.720]   You didn't see a spectacular debate or some miracle.
[00:12:31.720 --> 00:12:38.320]   Just a friend of yours became a Christian and shared the gospel with you or invited
[00:12:38.320 --> 00:12:39.800]   you to a church.
[00:12:39.800 --> 00:12:44.160]   Maybe aunt asked you to come to VBS.
[00:12:44.160 --> 00:12:47.480]   There's a couple people at our church who became a Christian because their aunt paid
[00:12:47.480 --> 00:12:50.000]   them to go to church.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:51.440]   That was their testimony.
[00:12:51.440 --> 00:12:54.880]   When they were little kids, they gave them like 10 bucks every time they came to church.
[00:12:54.880 --> 00:12:55.880]   So they came.
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:57.400]   That was their allowance.
[00:12:57.400 --> 00:13:01.120]   And they started attending VBS and they heard the gospel and they became Christian.
[00:13:01.120 --> 00:13:05.880]   I'll tell you who they are later.
[00:13:05.880 --> 00:13:09.960]   I say all of this as a setup for what we're looking at because there's two things that
[00:13:09.960 --> 00:13:13.840]   I want you to look at just as an overview of the list of these men.
[00:13:13.840 --> 00:13:20.440]   Number one, God used average, ordinary men and women who are faithful to spread the gospel.
[00:13:20.440 --> 00:13:21.440]   That's the first point.
[00:13:21.440 --> 00:13:26.600]   Paul says in verse 21, "Timothy, my fellow worker, greets you."
[00:13:26.600 --> 00:13:29.600]   Just as the disciples, when you looked at their character and their background, did
[00:13:29.600 --> 00:13:31.320]   it make sense?
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.680]   Why would God choose them?
[00:13:34.680 --> 00:13:37.080]   What credentials did they have?
[00:13:37.080 --> 00:13:40.680]   How were they going to spread this gospel that God's been preparing for thousands of
[00:13:40.680 --> 00:13:45.120]   years and that they put it in the hands of just fishermen who are not trained?
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:49.560]   In fact, they just failed miserably, their biggest test.
[00:13:49.560 --> 00:13:53.440]   And yet God gives them the responsibility that the whole world will hear the gospel
[00:13:53.440 --> 00:13:57.040]   through these men, at least initially.
[00:13:57.040 --> 00:14:01.440]   Just as the disciples didn't make sense, the disciples that they discipled didn't make
[00:14:01.440 --> 00:14:02.440]   a whole lot of sense.
[00:14:02.440 --> 00:14:08.280]   Timothy, Timothy was a man that Paul picks up in one of his missionary journeys in the
[00:14:08.280 --> 00:14:10.840]   city of Lystra.
[00:14:10.840 --> 00:14:13.160]   He wasn't any spectacular Jew like Paul.
[00:14:13.160 --> 00:14:17.800]   Paul was a man who may have been sitting in the Sanhedrin already, but Timothy was not.
[00:14:17.800 --> 00:14:22.560]   Timothy came from a home where his father may have been a Gentile and his mother was
[00:14:22.560 --> 00:14:25.320]   a Jew, and so he wasn't even circumcised.
[00:14:25.320 --> 00:14:29.160]   So he wasn't even a faithful Jew.
[00:14:29.160 --> 00:14:35.320]   In fact, Timothy didn't get converted because of Paul's great preaching.
[00:14:35.320 --> 00:14:40.720]   Paul says his grandmother Lois first became a Christian and then his mother Eunice became
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:42.920]   a Christian and they shared the gospel with him.
[00:14:42.920 --> 00:14:46.720]   So basically he became a Christian from his home.
[00:14:46.720 --> 00:14:50.160]   His grandmother and his mother, and we don't know where the father is.
[00:14:50.160 --> 00:14:52.040]   They think that he died when he was young.
[00:14:52.040 --> 00:14:57.120]   So he was probably raised in a single family home, meaning they were financially struggling
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:00.080]   and they weren't able to practice their Jewish faith.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:06.200]   And in that very mundane, average context, Timothy came to faith and then Paul picks
[00:15:06.200 --> 00:15:08.760]   him up and begins to follow him.
[00:15:08.760 --> 00:15:12.800]   And the age gap between Paul and Timothy was maybe about 25 to 30 years.
[00:15:12.800 --> 00:15:15.600]   So it wasn't like he was able to be productive right away.
[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:21.040]   He was a young guy that Paul actually had to nurture and take care of when he was young.
[00:15:21.040 --> 00:15:25.240]   He gets circumcised, he begins to follow Paul, and then we look at what was it about Timothy
[00:15:25.240 --> 00:15:26.960]   that Paul saw and said, "You know what?
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.680]   We're going to make sure that we see potential in this man so that he can grow up and be
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:36.720]   powerful to succeed him when he passes away."
[00:15:36.720 --> 00:15:40.400]   In fact, when we look at Timothy, we see exactly the opposite.
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:42.880]   Paul says in 1 Timothy 4.12 that he was young.
[00:15:42.880 --> 00:15:46.240]   "Let no one look down on your youthfulness."
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:50.000]   And he challenges him by speech, by conduct, love, faith, and purity.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:51.960]   Show yourself example of those who believe.
[00:15:51.960 --> 00:15:57.120]   The reason why he says that is because he was so young that the message that Paul was
[00:15:57.120 --> 00:16:01.480]   saying, "Go fight against these false teachers.
[00:16:01.480 --> 00:16:04.200]   Command them to stop them to teach these doctrines."
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:08.160]   And he was concerned that they were going to just nullify him because of his age.
[00:16:08.160 --> 00:16:11.480]   It was a very Asian culture.
[00:16:11.480 --> 00:16:15.200]   So they'll listen to the older people, but the younger people say, "You're too young.
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   How old are you?"
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   "26."
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:18.600]   "What could you possibly know?"
[00:16:19.240 --> 00:16:23.240]   He says, "Don't let them look down on your youthfulness, but set an example.
[00:16:23.240 --> 00:16:28.440]   They may question your age, but make sure that they don't question your character."
[00:16:28.440 --> 00:16:30.400]   So he was a young man.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:38.160]   And maybe that was related to the fact, this concern that Paul had in 2 Timothy 1.7 about
[00:16:38.160 --> 00:16:39.160]   his timidity.
[00:16:39.160 --> 00:16:44.360]   "For God has not given us a spirit of timidity, but of power and love and discipline."
[00:16:44.360 --> 00:16:47.560]   He wasn't just taking these characters out of the blue.
[00:16:47.560 --> 00:16:50.560]   He's concerned about Timothy's timidity.
[00:16:50.560 --> 00:16:52.900]   Maybe because he was young.
[00:16:52.900 --> 00:16:59.000]   Maybe he saw Paul as an apostle performing miracles and how well connected he was, Roman
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   citizen.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:02.000]   And maybe Timothy was intimidated by that.
[00:17:02.000 --> 00:17:07.640]   A lot of these men who are leaders in these churches already were prominent people, rich
[00:17:07.640 --> 00:17:08.640]   people.
[00:17:08.640 --> 00:17:13.000]   And this young pastor coming in there trying to fight for the right doctrine, and he says,
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:15.240]   "Don't be timid.
[00:17:15.240 --> 00:17:19.120]   Your authority doesn't come from your age or your personality.
[00:17:19.120 --> 00:17:20.680]   It comes from the Word of God."
[00:17:20.680 --> 00:17:25.320]   That's why Paul says repeatedly over and over in 2 Timothy, to stay faithful to the Word
[00:17:25.320 --> 00:17:29.680]   because that's where your authority comes from, whether they listen or don't listen.
[00:17:29.680 --> 00:17:33.760]   1 Timothy 5.23, he was sickly.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:37.920]   "No longer drink water exclusively, but use a little wine."
[00:17:37.920 --> 00:17:41.760]   Again, little wine.
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:42.760]   Don't forget that.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:43.760]   Little wine.
[00:17:43.760 --> 00:17:49.160]   Everybody say, "Well, Timothy drank, Jesus drank a little wine for the sake of your stomach
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.120]   and your frequent ailment."
[00:17:52.120 --> 00:17:55.360]   It's because Paul, again, he was a sickly man.
[00:17:55.360 --> 00:17:58.720]   He said, "You know, use some of that for medicinal purposes."
[00:17:58.720 --> 00:18:04.760]   So when you add all of this up, you can see why we might humanly look at that and say,
[00:18:04.760 --> 00:18:07.840]   "Wow, Timothy doesn't seem like the right person to choose."
[00:18:07.840 --> 00:18:09.600]   I mean, imagine the context that Paul was in.
[00:18:09.600 --> 00:18:12.440]   He's being beaten up, thrown into prison.
[00:18:12.440 --> 00:18:14.760]   It's the first century.
[00:18:14.760 --> 00:18:18.960]   Every synagogue that he goes to, majority of them are hostile.
[00:18:18.960 --> 00:18:25.200]   So you need a man who is committed, maybe a big guy because they're physically attacking
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:26.200]   them.
[00:18:26.200 --> 00:18:31.560]   Maybe a guy who's just muscular, you know, Samson type of a guy who's going to destroy
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:33.160]   the whole city if you mess with him.
[00:18:33.160 --> 00:18:38.360]   I mean, somebody who's not timid, maybe a bit older, maybe who had better connection.
[00:18:38.360 --> 00:18:41.400]   That would have been the wiser choice.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:47.960]   Timothy was just an average person, just like majority of human beings, majority of us.
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:53.840]   In fact, Paul goes on to say in 1 Corinthians 16, "If Timothy comes, see that he is with
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.960]   you without cause to be afraid."
[00:18:56.960 --> 00:18:59.880]   Again, he's concerned that Timothy is going to be timid.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:03.520]   "For he's doing the Lord's work as I also am.
[00:19:03.520 --> 00:19:09.680]   So let no one despise him, but send him on his way in peace so that he may come to me,
[00:19:09.680 --> 00:19:11.400]   for I expect him with the brethren."
[00:19:11.400 --> 00:19:15.520]   I mean, he sounds really like a father.
[00:19:15.520 --> 00:19:18.120]   I mean, he really sounds like a father concerned about his son.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:21.240]   He's going to come and, you know, I'm going to appoint him to continue to do my work,
[00:19:21.240 --> 00:19:23.360]   but don't give him any cause for him to be afraid.
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:25.640]   No, to protect him, right?
[00:19:25.640 --> 00:19:29.520]   He's not this mighty warrior coming into town who's going to set things straight.
[00:19:29.520 --> 00:19:30.760]   He said, "He's coming in.
[00:19:30.760 --> 00:19:31.760]   He's timid.
[00:19:31.760 --> 00:19:32.760]   He's sickly.
[00:19:32.760 --> 00:19:33.760]   He's young.
[00:19:33.760 --> 00:19:34.760]   Can you provide for him?
[00:19:34.760 --> 00:19:39.680]   Can you make sure that he's not afraid because he's among you?"
[00:19:39.680 --> 00:19:44.160]   All of these reasons are reasons that humanly we would look at and say, "Maybe he shouldn't
[00:19:44.160 --> 00:19:45.160]   have been.
[00:19:45.160 --> 00:19:49.120]   Maybe he shouldn't have been that guy."
[00:19:49.120 --> 00:19:54.320]   But one thing that Paul says repeatedly about Timothy, despite all of that, was his faithfulness.
[00:19:54.320 --> 00:19:59.040]   First Corinthians 4.17, "For this reason I have sent to you Timothy, who is my beloved
[00:19:59.040 --> 00:20:02.240]   and faithful child in the Lord.
[00:20:02.240 --> 00:20:07.320]   And he will remind you of my ways which are in Christ, just as I teach everywhere in every
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:08.320]   church."
[00:20:08.320 --> 00:20:12.440]   He says, despite all of that, despite all the other descriptions of Timothy, he says
[00:20:12.440 --> 00:20:14.980]   he is faithful.
[00:20:14.980 --> 00:20:19.760]   If one thing that I know that Timothy is going to do is he's going to do what I did, he's
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:23.480]   going to teach you what I taught you, he's not going to pervert the gospel.
[00:20:23.480 --> 00:20:25.680]   He's going to be faithful.
[00:20:25.680 --> 00:20:31.120]   Paul says again, a more detailed description in Philippians 2.19-23, "I hope in the Lord
[00:20:31.120 --> 00:20:35.840]   Jesus to send Timothy to you soon, so that I too may be cheered by news of you, for I
[00:20:35.840 --> 00:20:42.120]   have no one like him, who will be genuinely concerned for your welfare.
[00:20:42.120 --> 00:20:45.920]   They all seek their own interests, not those of Jesus Christ, but you know Timothy, proven
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:49.880]   worth, how as a son with a father he has served with me in the gospel.
[00:20:49.880 --> 00:20:55.800]   I hope therefore to send him just as soon as I see how it will go with me."
[00:20:55.800 --> 00:21:04.000]   The only quality that Paul describes of Timothy is that he cares for you as I cared for you.
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.980]   He doesn't talk about his great ordership, he doesn't talk about his great knowledge
[00:21:08.980 --> 00:21:12.800]   or his charismatic gift.
[00:21:12.800 --> 00:21:16.160]   The only reason why he commends him is, "I have nobody like him because nobody loves
[00:21:16.160 --> 00:21:21.160]   you like I love you."
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:30.500]   I mean, think about if you had a child and you're looking for babysitters, if the mother
[00:21:30.500 --> 00:21:37.480]   can't watch the child, the next best person is probably maybe grandma, usually.
[00:21:37.480 --> 00:21:43.160]   And the reason why is not because the children love grandma, they may or may not.
[00:21:43.160 --> 00:21:46.140]   It's not because she's so funny.
[00:21:46.140 --> 00:21:50.920]   It's not because she's covered in chocolate, you know, and that's why the kids love her.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:56.440]   It's because usually, and I'm not saying that this is true in every family, but usually
[00:21:56.440 --> 00:22:02.640]   the next best person that's going to love that child like a mother is probably grandma.
[00:22:02.640 --> 00:22:06.680]   Don't get offended, it may be grandfather in some situations, but I'm just generally
[00:22:06.680 --> 00:22:09.200]   speaking.
[00:22:09.200 --> 00:22:13.760]   Because you love your child and so you want somebody else who's going to love that child
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:17.040]   as much as you love that child.
[00:22:17.040 --> 00:22:21.760]   And so the greatest quality, and it'd be great if grandma can juggle and she can make balloon
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:29.040]   toys and make the best cakes, all that is great, but the greatest quality would be that
[00:22:29.040 --> 00:22:31.960]   that person who's going to watch your child is going to love that child like you love
[00:22:31.960 --> 00:22:33.840]   that child.
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:36.680]   And that's how Paul describes Timothy.
[00:22:36.680 --> 00:22:38.640]   Because Paul loved the Philippians.
[00:22:38.640 --> 00:22:41.120]   He said, "I have one person I can commend to you."
[00:22:41.120 --> 00:22:45.660]   Not because he is a great warrior, not because he knows the Bible better than anybody else.
[00:22:45.660 --> 00:22:47.640]   He loves you like I love you.
[00:22:47.640 --> 00:22:50.040]   He was faithful.
[00:22:50.040 --> 00:23:01.800]   See, God typically, God typically will use people who will be an extension of his heart,
[00:23:01.800 --> 00:23:05.280]   not simply his mouth.
[00:23:05.280 --> 00:23:09.240]   You can have a great mouth, you can have great gift, but if you don't love the church, that
[00:23:09.240 --> 00:23:15.440]   great mouth can do great damage in the church if you're not careful.
[00:23:15.440 --> 00:23:17.260]   Not only Timothy, but you look at Lucius.
[00:23:17.260 --> 00:23:18.700]   We don't know a whole lot about Lucius.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:20.340]   There's two options.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:25.440]   Lucius might be the Lucius of Cyrene that's mentioned in the Church of Antioch.
[00:23:25.440 --> 00:23:29.660]   Many people believe that it was Lucius Luke the physician.
[00:23:29.660 --> 00:23:36.100]   The reason why is because Apostle Paul oftentimes calls Lucius Lucas in other parts of the scripture,
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.140]   and Lucas is just another way of saying Lucius.
[00:23:38.140 --> 00:23:44.260]   Now, we don't know that for sure, but we know for a fact that Luke the physician was a companion
[00:23:44.260 --> 00:23:46.160]   of Apostle Paul.
[00:23:46.160 --> 00:23:48.540]   It mentions that in Colossians 4.14.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:53.580]   In fact, 2 Timothy 4.9-11, when Apostle Paul was sitting in prison, and he says, "All these
[00:23:53.580 --> 00:23:57.980]   people have abandoned me," and then in verse 11, it says, "Only Luke is with me."
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:02.980]   So we know for a fact that Luke was one of his close companions who was doing work in
[00:24:02.980 --> 00:24:03.980]   the background.
[00:24:03.980 --> 00:24:08.980]   In fact, Luke was the one who pens the book of Acts.
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:15.940]   And at the end of chapter 16 and chapter 21, Paul begins to say, "We," instead of Apostle
[00:24:15.940 --> 00:24:17.740]   Paul and Peter.
[00:24:17.740 --> 00:24:22.540]   He says, "We did this and we did that," because Luke was with them in their journey.
[00:24:22.540 --> 00:24:27.220]   Now, the reason why I highlight this was Luke was a physician.
[00:24:27.220 --> 00:24:31.460]   Now, that'd be a great person to have, right?
[00:24:31.460 --> 00:24:36.340]   If you're doing mission work and being bitten by scorpions, and you break your leg or sprain
[00:24:36.340 --> 00:24:40.700]   your leg or you have some flu or whatever it is that you have, it's great to have a
[00:24:40.700 --> 00:24:42.260]   physician with them.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:48.180]   You may think, again, when we think of apostles, I mean, these are guys who are raising people
[00:24:48.180 --> 00:24:49.300]   from the dead.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:52.180]   Their shadows would fall on people and then they would be raised.
[00:24:52.180 --> 00:24:56.140]   I mean, that's how much power that they had.
[00:24:56.140 --> 00:24:58.500]   So you would think, like, what do they need a physician for?
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:03.980]   I mean, because we have a tendency to look at the spectacular things that they have done,
[00:25:03.980 --> 00:25:05.500]   and we think that, "Oh, I'm sick.
[00:25:05.500 --> 00:25:07.380]   I'm going to heal myself today.
[00:25:07.380 --> 00:25:09.580]   Oh, I need money.
[00:25:09.580 --> 00:25:12.820]   I'm going to go fishing and take some gold out."
[00:25:12.820 --> 00:25:16.180]   Why is he making tents?
[00:25:16.180 --> 00:25:18.300]   Why is this guy making tents?
[00:25:18.300 --> 00:25:21.500]   Why does he even need a physician?
[00:25:21.500 --> 00:25:25.140]   Because we look at the spectacular things and say, "Oh, we think that that was the normal
[00:25:25.140 --> 00:25:27.980]   occurrence of everyday life of the Apostle Paul."
[00:25:27.980 --> 00:25:32.380]   But even Apostle Paul, he had to make money.
[00:25:32.380 --> 00:25:35.300]   He had a physician who was working with him.
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:40.220]   He says, "Tertius," he was a stenographer, he says it later on in this passage, and he
[00:25:40.220 --> 00:25:43.220]   says, "I, Tertius, write this with my own hands."
[00:25:43.220 --> 00:25:48.440]   He writes this because it was a common practice at that time, and you can understand why.
[00:25:48.440 --> 00:25:54.140]   When you type, everybody's penmanship looks the same.
[00:25:54.140 --> 00:25:58.620]   We rarely write notes, so we don't know what people's penmanship looks like.
[00:25:58.620 --> 00:26:01.540]   Some of you have great penmanship.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:04.740]   Some of you look like you wrote it with your left foot.
[00:26:04.740 --> 00:26:08.900]   You can't understand a word that you've put on paper.
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:13.560]   You can understand why, if you're writing a letter that needs to be read and to be spread,
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:18.540]   that there needs to be clarity, that you want the person with the best penmanship writing
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:20.820]   this.
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.580]   You can see why they would use a stenographer.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.060]   Think about the context of this.
[00:26:29.060 --> 00:26:33.820]   God didn't just imprint this on a stone tablet and say, "Here."
[00:26:33.820 --> 00:26:38.340]   That's part of the reason why so many non-Christians argue against the inerrancy of the scriptures.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.700]   "Oh, it was written by a man.
[00:26:40.700 --> 00:26:41.700]   It was written by a man.
[00:26:41.700 --> 00:26:44.180]   It was handed down from men.
[00:26:44.180 --> 00:26:49.660]   Stenographers just dictated these things, and all of these things are true."
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:55.020]   What they miss is that consistently, and not just in the New Testament, Old Testament,
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:58.060]   God used very mundane means.
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:02.060]   I'm going to get to that later on, why this is important.
[00:27:02.060 --> 00:27:06.620]   But God used very mundane means, ordinary people, through ordinary methods, to print
[00:27:06.620 --> 00:27:14.260]   down an extraordinary scripture that we were going to have, that we were going to preach
[00:27:14.260 --> 00:27:16.620]   out for thousands of years until he comes.
[00:27:16.620 --> 00:27:20.060]   We're going to be studying and dissecting every word that is written, and it was simply
[00:27:20.060 --> 00:27:25.340]   written through a man sitting in prison and stenographer just dictating it, and then a
[00:27:25.340 --> 00:27:30.940]   common person just taking it over there and handing it to people.
[00:27:30.940 --> 00:27:34.260]   That's how the Word of God came to us, very ordinary means.
[00:27:34.260 --> 00:27:42.620]   Not only did he use ordinary people, God used, number two, seemingly difficult situations,
[00:27:42.620 --> 00:27:48.460]   things that we would think would nullify God's work, God used seemingly difficult circumstances
[00:27:48.460 --> 00:27:52.420]   to produce great fruit.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:58.620]   Sometimes we have an idea of what God's ministry looks like, and when things begin to go astray,
[00:27:58.620 --> 00:28:03.740]   when we don't see the response or maybe we see opposition, automatically we think that
[00:28:03.740 --> 00:28:06.420]   God's not working.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:12.020]   Typically when we say in the mission field, "God opened doors," we mean that finance
[00:28:12.020 --> 00:28:16.380]   was provided, easy way to get in.
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.700]   People are, "Hey, can you come and please preach to us?"
[00:28:19.700 --> 00:28:23.100]   And you've got a group of people waiting for us to go and do the work.
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:27.660]   Typically when we say the doors opened, we mean that every obstacle has been taken care
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.540]   of so we can kind of go there and preach and come back.
[00:28:30.540 --> 00:28:34.100]   That's not what it meant in the New Testament, and that's not what God means when he says
[00:28:34.100 --> 00:28:35.100]   the doors opened.
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:39.180]   Doors opened simply means God told you to do it.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:40.540]   That's all it means.
[00:28:40.540 --> 00:28:44.620]   There might be opposition, there might be physical hardship, there might be financial
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:50.340]   problems, but when the doors open, it just means God said to go.
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:54.820]   Jason, that he mentions here, is from Thessalonica.
[00:28:54.820 --> 00:29:00.820]   Now in Acts 17, 2-9, Apostle Paul, by the time he gets to Thessalonica, he is beaten,
[00:29:00.820 --> 00:29:07.620]   imprisoned, stoned, and he comes to Thessalonica basically to get away from persecution and
[00:29:07.620 --> 00:29:08.820]   preach the gospel.
[00:29:08.820 --> 00:29:11.660]   And then some of the greatest persecution happens in this city.
[00:29:11.660 --> 00:29:15.100]   In fact, it was so great, he actually has to pack up his bag and leave.
[00:29:15.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   He never does that.
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:17.100]   You know, remember Lystra?
[00:29:17.100 --> 00:29:21.020]   He gets stoned, they drag him out, they think he's dead.
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:24.100]   When he reawakens, he just walks right back in.
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:26.020]   That's Apostle Paul.
[00:29:26.020 --> 00:29:31.140]   So you can imagine how intense the persecution was in Thessalonica, that Apostle Paul felt
[00:29:31.140 --> 00:29:35.180]   the need to pack up his bag and then go down to Berea.
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:36.180]   He ran out to Berea.
[00:29:36.180 --> 00:29:41.060]   So the scripture says he was only there for a short period of time, maybe three weeks.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:42.060]   No more than a couple of months.
[00:29:42.060 --> 00:29:47.500]   And that's why he writes 1 Thessalonians, because he's concerned that he left in a hurry
[00:29:47.500 --> 00:29:51.420]   and that Satan was going to come and teach false doctrines and the persecutors were going
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:52.420]   to squash this church.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:57.540]   And then he gets this great news that the short amount of time that they had the gospel,
[00:29:57.540 --> 00:29:59.180]   it was flourishing.
[00:29:59.180 --> 00:30:05.540]   Well, Jason was the chief target of this persecution at this city.
[00:30:05.540 --> 00:30:06.540]   That he took off.
[00:30:06.540 --> 00:30:10.660]   It says in Acts, I'm not going to read the whole thing, but Acts 17, 2-9, Jason invites
[00:30:10.660 --> 00:30:16.940]   Apostle Paul and his companions into his home because he becomes a believer.
[00:30:16.940 --> 00:30:18.540]   And then they get angry at Jason.
[00:30:18.540 --> 00:30:22.100]   This guy is supporting these men.
[00:30:22.100 --> 00:30:25.900]   So they begin to beat him and his family.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:29.700]   And as a result of that, I think Apostle Paul ended up leaving in order to protect
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:30.700]   Jason.
[00:30:30.700 --> 00:30:35.340]   Jason was from Thessalonica, a city that he was only there for a short period of time.
[00:30:35.340 --> 00:30:41.260]   And all of a sudden, this city that was being beaten up and Paul had to leave became the
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:44.180]   model church.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.180]   Not only Jason, but Sopater was from Berea.
[00:30:48.180 --> 00:30:52.200]   Berea was a city that they ran to because of persecution.
[00:30:52.200 --> 00:30:55.780]   And then Sopater becomes a Christian in that city.
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:31:00.260]   Gaius, Erastus, and Quartus was from Corinth.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:05.740]   If you know anything about Corinth, Apostle Paul entered into that city in fear and trembling,
[00:31:05.740 --> 00:31:08.420]   in the midst of all this persecution, being chased.
[00:31:08.420 --> 00:31:12.820]   By the time he gets to Corinth, you can tell Apostle Paul was tired and weak.
[00:31:12.820 --> 00:31:19.460]   He was tired because he was human, just like any of us.
[00:31:19.460 --> 00:31:26.260]   In Acts 18, 9-10, it says, "And the Lord said to Paul in the night by a vision, 'Do not
[00:31:26.260 --> 00:31:31.700]   be afraid any longer, but go on speaking and do not be silent, for I am with you.
[00:31:31.700 --> 00:31:35.940]   And no man will attack you in order to harm you, for I have many people in the city.'"
[00:31:35.940 --> 00:31:42.220]   Jesus himself has to speak to Paul to encourage him because he was so tired and worn out.
[00:31:42.220 --> 00:31:44.820]   In 1 Corinthians 2, 1-3, Paul describes himself.
[00:31:44.820 --> 00:31:49.140]   "When I came to you, brethren, I did not come with superiority of speech or of wisdom, proclaiming
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:51.740]   to you the testimony of God.
[00:31:51.740 --> 00:31:55.620]   For I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:32:01.860]   I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling."
[00:32:01.860 --> 00:32:11.280]   It was in this city where Erastus, Gaius, Portus, they come to faith and actually join
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:13.580]   Paul's ministry to preach the gospel.
[00:32:13.580 --> 00:32:17.740]   In this city that we would have often say, "You know, Paul didn't come in his power.
[00:32:17.740 --> 00:32:19.540]   He wasn't himself.
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.620]   He wasn't that same guy who entered into Lystra, stoned and picked himself back up, went back
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:25.620]   and preached the gospel.
[00:32:25.620 --> 00:32:26.620]   I'm ready to die for Jesus."
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:29.540]   By the time he comes to Corinth, he comes in weakness.
[00:32:29.540 --> 00:32:31.540]   And he himself says, "I came knowing nothing.
[00:32:31.540 --> 00:32:35.700]   I'm just going to preach Christ and I don't know nothing."
[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:40.020]   Maybe in the beginning of his ministry, he may have thought to himself, maybe, if he
[00:32:40.020 --> 00:32:46.180]   was like any other human being, "Maybe God chose me because I was a Pharisee among Pharisees.
[00:32:46.180 --> 00:32:47.180]   God needed me.
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.500]   My Roman citizenship is going to come in handy.
[00:32:50.500 --> 00:32:54.020]   All this education that I got from Gamaliel.
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:55.580]   Maybe that's the reason why he chose me."
[00:32:55.580 --> 00:33:00.740]   But by the time he comes to Corinth, all of that is beaten out of him.
[00:33:00.740 --> 00:33:02.420]   He's weak, he's trembling.
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:06.980]   The same thing that he was concerned about Timothy, Paul describes about himself entering
[00:33:06.980 --> 00:33:08.660]   into this city.
[00:33:08.660 --> 00:33:13.180]   And he says, "I came to know nothing but Jesus Christ."
[00:33:13.180 --> 00:33:18.660]   It may sound foolish to you, but to those who are being saved, it is the power of God.
[00:33:18.660 --> 00:33:25.580]   It is in his weakness that God showed himself in this city.
[00:33:25.580 --> 00:33:29.780]   Now the reason why this is so important is because majority of us live in this tension
[00:33:29.780 --> 00:33:32.300]   between, "I want to be great for the kingdom of God.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:33.300]   I want to spread the gospel.
[00:33:33.300 --> 00:33:35.940]   I want to do these things for God."
[00:33:35.940 --> 00:33:39.180]   And then we look at men, testimonies of people.
[00:33:39.180 --> 00:33:42.300]   We hear sermons, read books, and we get intimidated.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.600]   It's like, "Oh, maybe that's not for me.
[00:33:46.600 --> 00:33:49.700]   What place do I have in the kingdom of God?"
[00:33:49.700 --> 00:33:54.100]   There's a story about this man who's wrestling to connect with God, maybe living with that
[00:33:54.100 --> 00:34:00.620]   same tension that most of us live in, praying to God, "God, only if I can see you."
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:06.100]   And one day, a huge flood comes into town, and he happened to live in that flood zone,
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.380]   and everybody was escaping, and his car wouldn't start.
[00:34:09.380 --> 00:34:12.220]   So he began to pray, "Maybe this is it.
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.060]   Maybe finally I'm going to be able to meet you.
[00:34:14.060 --> 00:34:18.540]   Lord, if you would just show yourself to me and save me from this disaster, I will serve
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   you."
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:24.000]   And so he prays and prays and prays, and then he has this vision that God's going to answer
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   his prayer.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.140]   The next thing you know, you have a pickup truck that comes, "Hey, dude, what are you
[00:34:28.140 --> 00:34:29.140]   doing here?
[00:34:29.140 --> 00:34:30.140]   Get in the truck."
[00:34:30.140 --> 00:34:31.140]   And he's like, "No, no, no.
[00:34:31.140 --> 00:34:32.680]   I prayed to God.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:37.180]   I prayed to God that he would show himself to me, so I don't think that's you."
[00:34:37.180 --> 00:34:38.940]   So he takes off.
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:42.060]   Next thing, the water rises, and the boat comes, and he says, "Hey, what are you doing
[00:34:42.060 --> 00:34:43.060]   here?
[00:34:43.060 --> 00:34:45.100]   Good thing that I came by and I saw you."
[00:34:45.100 --> 00:34:46.100]   He says, "No, no, no.
[00:34:46.100 --> 00:34:51.060]   I prayed to God that he would answer my prayers, and I don't think this is it."
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:52.820]   And so the boat takes off.
[00:34:52.820 --> 00:34:56.020]   And finally, it gets to a point where not even the boat can get in.
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:35:02.260]   The helicopter, the rescue crew comes, and through speakers, "Hey, get on this ladder.
[00:35:02.260 --> 00:35:03.700]   Come up."
[00:35:03.700 --> 00:35:10.220]   And he's on his last leg on the rooftop, and this is the last thing that can come and rescue
[00:35:10.220 --> 00:35:11.220]   him.
[00:35:11.220 --> 00:35:12.220]   He says, "No, no, no.
[00:35:12.220 --> 00:35:13.780]   I'm a bad believer in God.
[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:15.780]   My God will rescue me."
[00:35:15.780 --> 00:35:18.260]   And then so the helicopter takes off.
[00:35:18.260 --> 00:35:21.220]   And then the flood comes, and then he dies.
[00:35:21.220 --> 00:35:24.780]   The end.
[00:35:24.780 --> 00:35:31.300]   He goes to heaven, and he begins to cry out to God, "God, I prayed that you would show
[00:35:31.300 --> 00:35:36.140]   yourself to me and rescue me, and it seemed like you were telling me that you were going
[00:35:36.140 --> 00:35:38.020]   to come, but what happened?"
[00:35:38.020 --> 00:35:43.220]   So God answers him, "I send you a pickup truck, I send you a boat, and I send you a
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:45.140]   helicopter.
[00:35:45.140 --> 00:35:49.360]   What more were you looking for?"
[00:35:49.360 --> 00:35:59.420]   You may have heard that story before, because I've told it before.
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:07.420]   But the point of that story is so relevant for majority of our Christian lives, because
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:11.940]   we're always looking for something spectacular.
[00:36:11.940 --> 00:36:19.060]   And I want to ask you, and we need to be careful, that desire for something spectacular, is
[00:36:19.060 --> 00:36:24.920]   that to glorify God or to glorify you?
[00:36:24.920 --> 00:36:30.820]   Is that to magnify His name, or you want some of that glory when He is magnified, like the
[00:36:30.820 --> 00:36:32.860]   disciples?
[00:36:32.860 --> 00:36:37.820]   We have a tendency that we want to glorify God, but we want to be glorified with Him.
[00:36:37.820 --> 00:36:39.940]   So we're looking for the spectacular.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:41.140]   We look at the testimonies.
[00:36:41.140 --> 00:36:43.420]   We read books and say, "Why not me?
[00:36:43.420 --> 00:36:47.060]   Why can't God use me to do this?"
[00:36:47.060 --> 00:36:54.820]   When the majority of what God desires is mundane, without name.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:37:00.140]   And when we die, no one's going to write about us, no one's going to praise us.
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:05.580]   There's not going to be a big church behind your name, or a book that you wrote, or thousands
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.060]   of people coming to your funeral.
[00:37:07.060 --> 00:37:11.620]   You're just going to be faithfully doing your job, and in the midst of that, your faithfulness,
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:12.820]   God is going to be glorified.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:18.500]   He ends this section by saying, "Grace of our Lord Jesus Christ be with you all."
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:23.540]   And it is always, every letter ends with that, "Grace be with you, grace be with you," because
[00:37:23.540 --> 00:37:26.940]   it is only by His grace that we can persevere.
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.260]   It is only by His grace that we can continue.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:37.620]   Now I want to summarize this sermon, this passage, with this.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:43.540]   Remember when we were studying through Leviticus, in chapters 26, was it 25?
[00:37:43.540 --> 00:37:47.180]   We were talking about the blessings and curses.
[00:37:47.180 --> 00:37:48.620]   Remember we were studying through that?
[00:37:48.620 --> 00:37:54.060]   And then we looked at all the blessings and all the cursing, if you don't follow Christ.
[00:37:54.060 --> 00:37:58.220]   And you looked at the list of the blessings, and all of them were just mundane things that
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:02.180]   God originated to begin with.
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:11.980]   He says, "If you follow my teachings and you obey me," He said, "rain will come in season."
[00:38:11.980 --> 00:38:12.980]   Rain will come in season.
[00:38:12.980 --> 00:38:13.980]   That's His blessing?
[00:38:13.980 --> 00:38:15.700]   There's no gold dust coming from the sky?
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:23.160]   He said, "No, rain will come in season," because that's what He intended to begin with.
[00:38:23.160 --> 00:38:26.860]   When sin came, it not only did it corrupt man, it corrupted creation.
[00:38:26.860 --> 00:38:31.860]   So He said, "When you obey and do what I tell you, God's going to restore what He intended
[00:38:31.860 --> 00:38:33.700]   to begin with.
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:36.620]   The natural order of things are going to be restored."
[00:38:36.620 --> 00:38:38.220]   He says, "Your enemies won't attack."
[00:38:38.220 --> 00:38:40.180]   There was no enemy before the sin.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:44.300]   He said, "When you obey," He said, "there is going to be no enemy.
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:46.340]   You're going to live in peace.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:50.140]   There's going to be wild animals that you're going to be able to live side by side with.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.440]   You don't have to lock your doors.
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:58.460]   When you plant seeds, it's going to bear fruit like it's supposed to do, and you're going
[00:38:58.460 --> 00:39:01.100]   to live long."
[00:39:01.100 --> 00:39:06.300]   Every single one of that was exactly what it was before the fall.
[00:39:06.300 --> 00:39:08.580]   There was nothing spectacular about it.
[00:39:08.580 --> 00:39:09.980]   He doesn't say gold dust.
[00:39:09.980 --> 00:39:11.940]   He doesn't say mansions.
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.940]   He just says, "In season, it's going to rain.
[00:39:14.940 --> 00:39:16.520]   You're not going to have enemies.
[00:39:16.520 --> 00:39:23.440]   When you work, you're going to bear fruit exactly as God intended."
[00:39:23.440 --> 00:39:27.080]   Why is this so significant?
[00:39:27.080 --> 00:39:33.240]   Because the point of redemption is to restore what was lost.
[00:39:33.240 --> 00:39:41.760]   Husbands acting like husbands, wife acting like wives, children acting like children
[00:39:41.760 --> 00:39:46.520]   submitted to their parents.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:58.120]   Society, community, grandparents, work, rest, all of that is to be redeemed in His name.
[00:39:58.120 --> 00:40:03.200]   So the point of the gospel and reception of the gospel is to become faithful to what God
[00:40:03.200 --> 00:40:05.300]   intended in our life to begin with.
[00:40:05.300 --> 00:40:10.000]   God didn't call all of us to go out to the mission field, I mean, across the sea, and
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:12.920]   the majority of us won't.
[00:40:12.920 --> 00:40:16.040]   Some people will say, "You know, this is not enough.
[00:40:16.040 --> 00:40:17.040]   I want to do this."
[00:40:17.040 --> 00:40:20.520]   God places His heart, "And I want to go do this."
[00:40:20.520 --> 00:40:26.600]   Majority of us, God has called us to be faithful where we're at.
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:28.960]   And God will be glorified.
[00:40:28.960 --> 00:40:29.960]   God will be glorified.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.840]   And you and I will do our part.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:39.200]   You ever wonder, in John chapter 20, 28 through 29, Thomas sees the resurrected Christ and
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:43.880]   he couldn't believe it and says, "Lord, let me put my hands in your scars."
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:47.680]   And then when he finally recognizes that this is the resurrected Lord, Thomas, the doubting
[00:40:47.680 --> 00:40:54.200]   Thomas is the first one who goes down to his knees and says, "My Lord and my God."
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:41:01.280]   It's a first direct confession of Jesus' deity from the disciple, "My Lord, my God."
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:06.440]   But Jesus doesn't hear that and say, "Great, you're the first one."
[00:41:06.440 --> 00:41:08.560]   He actually rebukes him in the next passage, verse 29.
[00:41:08.560 --> 00:41:11.720]   Jesus said to him, "Because you have seen me, have you believed?
[00:41:11.720 --> 00:41:16.800]   Blessed are they who did not see and yet believe."
[00:41:16.800 --> 00:41:19.800]   I didn't understand that for years.
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:23.960]   Of course our faith would be stronger if we saw Jesus resurrected.
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:29.840]   And it would only make sense that Thomas actually put his fingers in his scars and that's what
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:31.260]   caused him to open his eyes.
[00:41:31.260 --> 00:41:32.260]   What did Jesus mean?
[00:41:32.260 --> 00:41:35.080]   "Blessed are those who do not see and yet believe."
[00:41:35.080 --> 00:41:36.080]   You believe because you saw.
[00:41:36.080 --> 00:41:39.880]   "Blessed are those who do not see."
[00:41:39.880 --> 00:41:44.680]   It took me years to figure out what Jesus was saying.
[00:41:44.680 --> 00:41:51.320]   God put his imprint of himself, it says in Romans chapter one, all over his existing
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.120]   creation.
[00:41:54.120 --> 00:42:00.360]   But the rebellion of man refused to see that, refuses to see God in it.
[00:42:00.360 --> 00:42:05.480]   It is man's arrogance to think that even this earth and there's enough oxygen in this world
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.640]   and the money that you have, somehow we did it.
[00:42:08.640 --> 00:42:15.000]   And all God needs to do is just remove himself from this earth and we suffocate.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:19.040]   We die, we burn, we can't live.
[00:42:19.040 --> 00:42:23.200]   I mean, it's man's arrogance to think like, "It just happened."
[00:42:23.200 --> 00:42:25.600]   How did it just happen?
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.120]   You don't come out of your house and see a dent in the side of your car and say, "It
[00:42:29.120 --> 00:42:30.120]   just happened."
[00:42:30.120 --> 00:42:31.740]   You'd be foolish.
[00:42:31.740 --> 00:42:34.320]   Everybody would think you're foolish to say, "It just happened."
[00:42:34.320 --> 00:42:37.400]   But we look at the complexity of the universe and we say, "It just happened."
[00:42:37.400 --> 00:42:41.920]   And somehow that's very, very smart.
[00:42:41.920 --> 00:42:46.080]   Years of education has taught us it just happened.
[00:42:46.080 --> 00:42:51.360]   A fool says in his heart, "There is no God."
[00:42:51.360 --> 00:42:56.000]   The miracle is happening every single day that we live.
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:57.160]   You and I don't have that power.
[00:42:57.160 --> 00:42:59.040]   I can tell you I'm going to be somewhere tomorrow.
[00:42:59.040 --> 00:43:00.320]   I don't have the power.
[00:43:00.320 --> 00:43:01.320]   Something could happen.
[00:43:01.320 --> 00:43:02.320]   I can get sick.
[00:43:02.320 --> 00:43:04.240]   There might be a traffic accident.
[00:43:04.240 --> 00:43:07.640]   I may just change my heart.
[00:43:07.640 --> 00:43:10.640]   I don't have that kind of control.
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:18.640]   And yet God created the universe to sustain our life and every part of his creation declares
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:24.680]   his glory but sinful man.
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:31.960]   If you require the spectacular to give God the glory, you will always be dependent upon
[00:43:31.960 --> 00:43:33.600]   the spectacular.
[00:43:33.600 --> 00:43:40.200]   But if you see the spectacular in the mundane, you will see God.
[00:43:40.200 --> 00:43:47.080]   Let's take some time to pray.
[00:43:47.080 --> 00:43:51.280]   Welcome our welcome worship team to lead us in worship.
[00:43:51.280 --> 00:43:57.360]   Let's take some time to come and above everything else to connect with our living God.
[00:43:57.360 --> 00:44:01.400]   If we've been living our lives with blindfolds, looking for something to happen to us or a
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:06.200]   circumstance to change and not recognizing the gift that God has given us in our daily
[00:44:06.200 --> 00:44:12.200]   lives and as a result of that maybe we haven't been so faithful.
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:15.960]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord and really connect with God and to thank him
[00:44:15.960 --> 00:44:18.520]   for the mundane things that God is doing in our lives.
[00:44:18.520 --> 00:44:18.800]   Let's pray.
[00:44:18.800 --> 00:44:28.660]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
