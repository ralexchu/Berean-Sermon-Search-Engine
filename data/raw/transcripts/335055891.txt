[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:17.240]   All right, so we're going to get into the topic of anxiety, something that obviously
[00:00:17.240 --> 00:00:21.680]   many, many, many people struggle with.
[00:00:21.680 --> 00:00:24.200]   Psychology has a lot to say about anxiety.
[00:00:24.200 --> 00:00:28.880]   I'm sure that you've been taught a lot of things in your life, but today we're going
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:33.520]   to actually look at what the Bible says about anxiety.
[00:00:33.520 --> 00:00:41.640]   It's important to have a biblical view on this because the world has a way of shaping
[00:00:41.640 --> 00:00:46.720]   our thinking, and I want the Word of God to shape your thinking.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:53.120]   Just to begin with a little definition, defining, we'll just kind of get right into it because
[00:00:53.120 --> 00:00:54.120]   I'm sure you're exhausted.
[00:00:54.120 --> 00:01:01.120]   I hope that you can endure with me, but the first thing that we should note is that in
[00:01:01.120 --> 00:01:08.240]   the Bible, the word worry is actually often translated as anxiety or concern.
[00:01:08.240 --> 00:01:14.960]   So in our vernacular, we typically say worry, but what we mean by that, or at least how
[00:01:14.960 --> 00:01:18.600]   the Bible speaks to that, is anxiety or concern.
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:26.320]   Jay Adams points out, Jay Adams is one of our biblical counseling mentors, you know,
[00:01:26.320 --> 00:01:28.800]   we've learned from him over the years.
[00:01:28.800 --> 00:01:35.200]   He points out that really the Greek word for anxiety ought to be translated worry because
[00:01:35.200 --> 00:01:38.920]   it's something that we understand better in our contemporary language.
[00:01:38.920 --> 00:01:42.840]   But anyways, here's a good definition.
[00:01:42.840 --> 00:01:48.560]   According to Jesus, the definition for anxiety just simply means to care for or be concerned
[00:01:48.560 --> 00:01:50.800]   about some future event.
[00:01:50.800 --> 00:01:54.240]   It's really small up there, but at least you've got it on your outline.
[00:01:54.240 --> 00:02:00.480]   So again, to care for or to be concerned about some future event.
[00:02:00.480 --> 00:02:06.600]   He tells us in Matthew 6, 25, "Therefore I tell you, do not be anxious about your life,
[00:02:06.600 --> 00:02:11.240]   what you will eat or what you will drink, nor about your body, what you will put on.
[00:02:11.240 --> 00:02:15.920]   It's not life more than food and the body more than clothing."
[00:02:15.920 --> 00:02:20.600]   So it's just interesting to note that there really are two types of anxiety in the Bible.
[00:02:20.600 --> 00:02:24.800]   You have a godly concern, people can have godly concern.
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:29.480]   It's not always ungodly or ungodly concern.
[00:02:29.480 --> 00:02:33.040]   But let's just kind of take a look at godly concern.
[00:02:33.040 --> 00:02:40.440]   Paul talks about godly concern, especially in one particular verse in 1 Corinthians 12,
[00:02:40.440 --> 00:02:41.440]   25.
[00:02:41.440 --> 00:02:45.480]   He's talking to the church there and he's saying, you know, he hopes that there may
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:51.680]   be no division in the body there, but that the members may have the same care for one
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:52.920]   another.
[00:02:52.920 --> 00:02:57.440]   And that verse is really speaking to Christians and what he's saying there is that we as a
[00:02:57.440 --> 00:03:02.480]   body of believers should have care, the same care for one another.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:08.720]   So the Apostle Paul was genuinely concerned, or you could say had godly concern or godly
[00:03:08.720 --> 00:03:15.160]   anxiety, because he was eager to maintain unity in the body in Corinth.
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:18.360]   And he wanted them to be more focused on the greater gift.
[00:03:18.360 --> 00:03:23.120]   Because if you know anything about the book of Corinthians, it's, you know, a lot of the
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:27.040]   people that went to church there, they were really kind of more about the gifts that they
[00:03:27.040 --> 00:03:29.760]   had and the boasting in those gifts.
[00:03:29.760 --> 00:03:32.560]   But he kind of gets after him about that.
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:38.640]   And he says, really the greater gift is Christ and you shouldn't have that self-focus.
[00:03:38.640 --> 00:03:40.720]   And so he had a genuine concern.
[00:03:40.720 --> 00:03:43.960]   He's expressing godly concern.
[00:03:43.960 --> 00:03:49.120]   He wants them to have godly concern for one another.
[00:03:49.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   And so concern that is constructive is not a sin.
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:56.520]   I mean, there's lots of times when you're going to have godly concern for people and
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:03:58.520]   that's appropriate.
[00:03:58.520 --> 00:04:04.240]   Scripture recognizes certain types of intense concern as being perfectly legitimate for
[00:04:04.240 --> 00:04:05.240]   Christians.
[00:04:05.240 --> 00:04:08.720]   Do you think of some times in your life where godly concern would be appropriate?
[00:04:08.720 --> 00:04:09.720]   Yeah.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:10.720]   What about your children?
[00:04:10.720 --> 00:04:15.800]   You know, you're concerned for them in particular ways or friends that are making particular
[00:04:15.800 --> 00:04:16.800]   choices.
[00:04:16.800 --> 00:04:22.440]   So sometimes it's completely legitimate to have godly concern.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:28.360]   But what about when you're, another thing is the way God wires us, think about times
[00:04:28.360 --> 00:04:35.340]   when you're kind of walking in a potentially dangerous area and you notice that your senses
[00:04:35.340 --> 00:04:37.880]   are a little bit heightened.
[00:04:37.880 --> 00:04:42.800]   And that's a good thing because that godly concern can get you out of trouble and kind
[00:04:42.800 --> 00:04:45.640]   of make you a little bit more discerning about your environment.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:49.680]   But God's Word does address ungodly concern or anxiety.
[00:04:49.680 --> 00:04:52.840]   And so let's turn to Philippians 4, 6.
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:54.720]   Take a look at that.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:59.280]   Turn book over.
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:07.960]   Paul says in verse 6, "Be anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication
[00:05:07.960 --> 00:05:14.080]   with thanksgiving, let your requests be made known to God."
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:19.200]   And in that verse, Paul is actually using the same word for anxiety as he did in the
[00:05:19.200 --> 00:05:23.440]   first Corinthian verse, but this is in the negative form.
[00:05:23.440 --> 00:05:31.520]   In this context, anxiety means to divide or to rip apart or just to be distracted in your
[00:05:31.520 --> 00:05:32.680]   attention.
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:37.000]   And so this word is actually describing the action and the effect of worry.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.560]   So unlike the care and concern that he had for the church in Corinth, unlike that, he
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:50.400]   is trying to show us, you know, that there's a type of anxiety that can be very destructive
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:53.040]   and very sinful in our life.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:56.920]   And really the big difference between both of these, the godly concern and the ungodly
[00:05:56.920 --> 00:06:01.480]   concern, is that godly concern focuses on God.
[00:06:01.480 --> 00:06:05.280]   So if you want to discern whether you have ungodly or godly concern, godly concern has
[00:06:05.280 --> 00:06:11.200]   its focus on God, and ungodly concern, of course, is a little bit more self-centered
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:12.920]   in its focus.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:14.960]   And so it's important to think through that.
[00:06:14.960 --> 00:06:19.360]   I thought what would be a good idea is to introduce you to two women in the Bible to
[00:06:19.360 --> 00:06:21.960]   kind of, so you can look at their life.
[00:06:21.960 --> 00:06:25.800]   Let's let Scripture shape our thinking in that sense.
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:28.880]   There are two women in the Bible that we can look at.
[00:06:28.880 --> 00:06:34.160]   One had a godly concern and one had a very ungodly concern.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:40.400]   Both believers, both love the Lord, but one of them that was having ungodly concern was
[00:06:40.400 --> 00:06:43.440]   just having a really, really bad day.
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:47.640]   And I think that you'll relate to her, most women do.
[00:06:47.640 --> 00:06:50.440]   And so why don't we go ahead and we'll look at that now.
[00:06:50.440 --> 00:07:02.840]   Go ahead and turn back to Luke 10, and we're going to focus our attention on verses 38
[00:07:02.840 --> 00:07:05.000]   to 42, and I'll just read it for you.
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:06.440]   You'll recognize who this is right away.
[00:07:06.440 --> 00:07:09.440]   I'm sure this is a familiar passage.
[00:07:09.440 --> 00:07:18.560]   "Now as they were traveling along, Jesus entered a village, and a woman named Martha welcomed
[00:07:18.560 --> 00:07:21.240]   him into her home.
[00:07:21.240 --> 00:07:26.360]   She had a sister called Mary, who was seated at the Lord's feet, listening to his word.
[00:07:26.360 --> 00:07:32.040]   But Martha was distracted with all her preparations, and she came up to him and said, 'Lord, do
[00:07:32.040 --> 00:07:37.760]   you not care that my sister has left me to do all the serving alone?
[00:07:37.760 --> 00:07:39.960]   Then tell her to help me.'
[00:07:39.960 --> 00:07:44.840]   But the Lord answered and said to her, 'Martha, Martha, you are worried and bothered about
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:52.400]   so many things, but only one thing is necessary, for Mary has chosen the good part which shall
[00:07:52.400 --> 00:07:55.520]   not be taken away from her.'"
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:59.000]   And so here we have two sisters.
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:00.400]   This could be anybody's life.
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:02.200]   We've all been here, I think.
[00:08:02.200 --> 00:08:06.680]   But we have two sisters who lived with their brother Lazarus.
[00:08:06.680 --> 00:08:11.000]   And Bethany, and I've been there, Bethany is about a city that's about two miles away
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   from Jerusalem.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:14.280]   You can walk there.
[00:08:14.280 --> 00:08:19.480]   And Martha is probably the oldest of these two sisters.
[00:08:19.480 --> 00:08:25.760]   Some commentators say that she was probably a widow, and so this house was probably hers.
[00:08:25.760 --> 00:08:32.000]   And apparently at this time, Jesus was passing through and came to Martha's house, probably
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:36.120]   at her invitation, more than likely.
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:39.480]   And I don't think this invitation would have been unusual.
[00:08:39.480 --> 00:08:44.840]   I think that we know from other texts, like when we read through the book of John 11,
[00:08:44.840 --> 00:08:48.680]   5 in particular, we learn a little bit about Martha and Mary.
[00:08:48.680 --> 00:08:51.860]   We learn that these women really loved the Lord, including Lazarus.
[00:08:51.860 --> 00:08:54.120]   These were friends of Christ.
[00:08:54.120 --> 00:09:01.120]   So it wouldn't have been unusual for her to invite him over to her house for dinner with
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:02.720]   her sister and brother.
[00:09:02.720 --> 00:09:08.600]   And when you find yourself in this kind of a life circumstance, like Martha did, like
[00:09:08.600 --> 00:09:10.320]   any good hostess, what do you do?
[00:09:10.320 --> 00:09:12.200]   When you have people come over, what do you do?
[00:09:12.200 --> 00:09:18.080]   You get into task mode, and you begin to engage in whatever the cultural expectation is at
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:19.080]   the time.
[00:09:19.080 --> 00:09:24.680]   And for sure, the cultural expectation at that time would have been if you had a guest
[00:09:24.680 --> 00:09:30.840]   come to your house, you would get on it, you would make those preparations for the meal.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:34.840]   And get this, as a woman, I think you can identify with this.
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:40.320]   It is probably assumed that Martha had to get food together, not just for Jesus.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.920]   He probably had at least the 12 disciples with him.
[00:09:42.920 --> 00:09:45.060]   Okay, so think about that.
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:49.480]   And some commentators say that, so it could have been a dinner party for about 15, but
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:53.360]   sometimes commentators will say it could have been 70 people.
[00:09:53.360 --> 00:09:55.920]   But we'll just kind of camp on 15, not to get too overwhelmed.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:10:00.720]   But even 15 could be quite a bit.
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:04.140]   Now before I kind of pick on Martha a little bit, I just want you to know, I don't have
[00:10:04.140 --> 00:10:07.480]   any doubt in my mind that Martha is a believer.
[00:10:07.480 --> 00:10:08.480]   She loved the Lord.
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.960]   This isn't like a contrast between an unbeliever and a believer or anything like that.
[00:10:11.960 --> 00:10:17.140]   I just really think that she, as a believer, is just like a lot of us.
[00:10:17.140 --> 00:10:20.920]   And so she was just having a particularly tough day.
[00:10:20.920 --> 00:10:25.400]   And we know, again, that she loved the Lord from other cross-references.
[00:10:25.400 --> 00:10:31.280]   So if we assume the best, if a person like Martha came to me for counsel, because she's
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:38.120]   anxious about so many things, I would honestly think that Martha was somebody that had as
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:43.160]   an original heart motive to serve others and to be a blessing.
[00:10:43.160 --> 00:10:44.720]   I would have thought the best that way.
[00:10:44.720 --> 00:10:46.640]   I would have thought she started out great.
[00:10:46.640 --> 00:10:48.920]   I can see her servant's heart.
[00:10:48.920 --> 00:10:54.000]   I can see her desire to want to serve others and to practice hospitality.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.840]   It's very evident in her life, and it's very commendable.
[00:10:57.840 --> 00:11:03.880]   But what we need to discover is how did Martha, who had great intentions here, how did she
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:08.280]   go from joyfully serving others to suddenly this ungodly concern?
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:11.200]   How did she get from here to here?
[00:11:11.200 --> 00:11:14.480]   And becoming anxious about so many things.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.140]   And we need to ask, because Jesus says at the end that, "Martha, Martha, you're worried
[00:11:20.140 --> 00:11:22.120]   about so many things."
[00:11:22.120 --> 00:11:26.740]   And so he had to even gently rebuke her at that.
[00:11:26.740 --> 00:11:30.320]   So let's go back to the text now.
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:33.120]   Luke actually gives us a clue word in verse 40.
[00:11:33.120 --> 00:11:37.640]   So look at verse 40 of the passage.
[00:11:37.640 --> 00:11:43.840]   And in contrast to what her sister Mary is doing, Martha was what?
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:44.800]   What does the text say?
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:50.240]   She was distracted, right?
[00:11:50.240 --> 00:11:52.440]   With all her preparations.
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.880]   That word "distracted" in the original language just kind of has the idea of being drawn away.
[00:11:57.880 --> 00:12:03.480]   So she was being drawn away from Christ by this task at hand.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:09.180]   Or she was overly occupied with whatever it is that she is doing.
[00:12:09.180 --> 00:12:12.040]   Or she is just too busy.
[00:12:12.040 --> 00:12:14.700]   Too busy about a thing.
[00:12:14.700 --> 00:12:15.840]   And it's interesting, isn't it?
[00:12:15.840 --> 00:12:21.340]   Because at first, remember, what we notice about Martha is that her external behavior
[00:12:21.340 --> 00:12:22.940]   was servanthood.
[00:12:22.940 --> 00:12:26.300]   She had as an idea to serve others.
[00:12:26.300 --> 00:12:27.340]   Great.
[00:12:27.340 --> 00:12:32.200]   She welcomed Christ into her home for a meal, but somewhere in the process of preparing
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:39.840]   and serving, Mary became overly occupied or overly busy about that task.
[00:12:39.840 --> 00:12:43.220]   And in contrast to Mary, she became distracted.
[00:12:43.220 --> 00:12:44.500]   Now what was Mary up to?
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:45.500]   Look at verse 39.
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:48.060]   What was she up to?
[00:12:48.060 --> 00:12:51.320]   She was what?
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.780]   She was sitting at the Lord's feet, right?
[00:12:55.780 --> 00:12:56.900]   Listening to his word.
[00:12:56.900 --> 00:12:59.300]   So she was not distracted.
[00:12:59.300 --> 00:13:00.900]   She was focused.
[00:13:00.900 --> 00:13:04.540]   She was focused and sitting lovingly at Christ's feet.
[00:13:04.540 --> 00:13:09.260]   And so here's an interesting cultural side note on this whole issue.
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:16.660]   In that culture, the rabbis would take on certain students, and these students would
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.180]   literally sit at their feet.
[00:13:19.180 --> 00:13:24.480]   And those students would have been considered disciples of whoever the rabbi was.
[00:13:24.480 --> 00:13:28.380]   So when the text says, you know, we read these things, but if you really want to take it
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:34.060]   at a different dimension, when the text says that Mary was sitting at the feet of Christ,
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:37.820]   it's trying to give you a picture of what a true disciple is.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:38.820]   Okay?
[00:13:38.820 --> 00:13:44.140]   So Mary is sitting at the feet of Christ, and she's taking on that role of a disciple.
[00:13:44.140 --> 00:13:49.780]   And that was a big deal, because rabbis back then didn't take on women as disciples.
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.500]   But Christ did, and that was actually really radical.
[00:13:52.500 --> 00:13:55.060]   That was a radical thing for him.
[00:13:55.060 --> 00:13:58.920]   And in the Gospels, you know, we often see Christ encouraging women to listen to his
[00:13:58.920 --> 00:14:00.060]   teaching.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:04.680]   I'm always encouraged when I read the resurrection story, because it was the women that he saw
[00:14:04.680 --> 00:14:05.680]   first post-resurrection.
[00:14:05.680 --> 00:14:09.380]   So he cares for women, lots and lots.
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:11.160]   But that was very radical.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.120]   And so here we have two women in the same intense circumstance.
[00:14:16.120 --> 00:14:18.200]   The pressure is on.
[00:14:18.200 --> 00:14:21.800]   You know, this would be their heat, in a sense.
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:27.760]   One person is choosing to intently focus and listen to Jesus, while the other is distracted
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:33.480]   with her serving, and it got in the way of her doing the same as her sister.
[00:14:33.480 --> 00:14:37.100]   So what were some of the effects of Martha's ungodly concern?
[00:14:37.100 --> 00:14:40.520]   Because we need to kind of think through, what did it reap?
[00:14:40.520 --> 00:14:44.400]   You know, what kind of fruit did it reap as a result of her getting kind of worked up
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:48.600]   and anxious?
[00:14:48.600 --> 00:14:52.880]   Looking back at verse 40, it says, "But Martha was distracted with much serving, and she
[00:14:52.880 --> 00:14:59.140]   went up to him and said, 'Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to serve alone?
[00:14:59.140 --> 00:15:01.240]   Tell her then to help me.'"
[00:15:01.240 --> 00:15:02.240]   And you know what?
[00:15:02.240 --> 00:15:05.560]   I could say that a little bit louder, because she meant it intensely.
[00:15:05.560 --> 00:15:08.400]   Can you imagine talking to Jesus like that?
[00:15:08.400 --> 00:15:10.520]   But she was worked up.
[00:15:10.520 --> 00:15:16.740]   And so the first effect, or you could say the first complicated sin, is that her anxiety
[00:15:16.740 --> 00:15:23.320]   or her ungodly concern manifested so much so that she went up to Jesus and she actually
[00:15:23.320 --> 00:15:27.440]   interrupted his teaching.
[00:15:27.440 --> 00:15:32.920]   The second effect, or complicated sin, is that she humiliated Mary in front of everybody.
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:35.480]   What was she assuming about Mary?
[00:15:35.480 --> 00:15:36.480]   She was what?
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:37.480]   Maybe lazy?
[00:15:37.480 --> 00:15:40.080]   There was some assumption on her part.
[00:15:40.080 --> 00:15:43.760]   Do you think Mary was being lazy?
[00:15:43.760 --> 00:15:44.760]   No way.
[00:15:44.760 --> 00:15:45.760]   No way.
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:49.580]   Mary was—where Mary's actually—her priorities were in the right place.
[00:15:49.580 --> 00:15:54.800]   She was sitting at Christ's feet, and he was shepherding her through his teaching that
[00:15:54.800 --> 00:15:59.640]   evening, which is what happens when we make it a priority to spend time with the Lord.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:01.680]   He shepherds us.
[00:16:01.680 --> 00:16:08.120]   And he helps us when we seek him out through his word and in prayer.
[00:16:08.120 --> 00:16:12.120]   And that's really actually a very significant part of this narrative and something that
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:17.480]   you'll need to point out to women who you might counsel on this issue.
[00:16:17.480 --> 00:16:21.600]   Above all other things, one thing I would encourage them to do is that you need to be
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:24.080]   spending more time with Christ.
[00:16:24.080 --> 00:16:30.160]   I think that you're just so caught up and distracted by what's going on in your life,
[00:16:30.160 --> 00:16:36.160]   the pressures outside of yourself, that you're allowing that to distract you from your relationship
[00:16:36.160 --> 00:16:37.160]   with the Lord.
[00:16:37.160 --> 00:16:41.360]   And so we would be talking about what we can do to help her to spend more time with her
[00:16:41.360 --> 00:16:42.360]   Savior.
[00:16:42.360 --> 00:16:44.880]   We're in relationship with our Savior, right?
[00:16:44.880 --> 00:16:48.400]   We don't want to think of Christ like a roommate that we never see.
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:50.720]   We're like two ships passing in the night.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.080]   And that's often how people deal with their relationship with the Lord.
[00:16:54.080 --> 00:16:57.920]   We're actually in a relationship, and so we want to spend time with him.
[00:16:57.920 --> 00:17:02.520]   And it's only when Jesus has filled up our own lives and ministered to our own souls
[00:17:02.520 --> 00:17:06.380]   that we would even be fit to serve him and others.
[00:17:06.380 --> 00:17:09.200]   So Mary's heart was really in the right place at that time.
[00:17:09.200 --> 00:17:10.940]   She wasn't lazy.
[00:17:10.940 --> 00:17:16.360]   She was focusing all her attention on Christ, and he was ministering to her.
[00:17:16.360 --> 00:17:23.120]   But Martha, on the other hand, she was distracted by all of these preparations that she had
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:24.120]   to deal with.
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:26.080]   And she was also anxious about the future deadline.
[00:17:26.080 --> 00:17:30.840]   I'm sure as a woman, if you've been in this situation before, sometimes when we're serving,
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:35.680]   we're doing dinner and things like that, we get very anxious about getting things on the
[00:17:35.680 --> 00:17:36.680]   table on time.
[00:17:36.680 --> 00:17:41.480]   You know, there's just a lot that we think about in preparation.
[00:17:41.480 --> 00:17:43.440]   And so she probably, I mean, can you imagine?
[00:17:43.440 --> 00:17:45.040]   I can kind of identify.
[00:17:45.040 --> 00:17:49.240]   I'm like, I can see why she got angry at her sister, because she's not helping her.
[00:17:49.240 --> 00:17:50.920]   That would have been the cultural expectation.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:51.920]   What are you doing?
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:52.920]   What are you doing?
[00:17:52.920 --> 00:17:55.380]   Why aren't you helping me?
[00:17:55.380 --> 00:17:59.080]   But really, she was thinking the worst about Mary, and that's really a lack of love for
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:02.520]   her, which is really a problem.
[00:18:02.520 --> 00:18:08.000]   So the third effect, or maybe complicated sin of Martha's ungodly concern, and maybe
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:13.920]   the biggest bomb of all, is she told Jesus, "Lord, do you not care?"
[00:18:13.920 --> 00:18:15.160]   Can you imagine?
[00:18:15.160 --> 00:18:17.800]   "Lord, do you not care?"
[00:18:17.800 --> 00:18:19.840]   She's actually accusing Jesus of something.
[00:18:19.840 --> 00:18:21.960]   What's she accusing him of?
[00:18:21.960 --> 00:18:22.960]   Without realizing.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:26.840]   She's accusing him maybe of sinning, you think?
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:32.080]   So at least she's accusing him of failing to do what is right.
[00:18:32.080 --> 00:18:34.660]   And it's kind of fun.
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:41.280]   When I was talking to my pastor about this passage a few years ago, he told me that with
[00:18:41.280 --> 00:18:46.760]   this particular study, he said there's some ancient manuscripts that were written about
[00:18:46.760 --> 00:18:48.760]   this passage.
[00:18:48.760 --> 00:18:51.160]   And let me just kind of quote this.
[00:18:51.160 --> 00:19:01.040]   It says, "At that time, when Mary said those things, the disciples moved away from Martha
[00:19:01.040 --> 00:19:04.960]   because they were fearful that they might be scorched by the fires of heaven."
[00:19:04.960 --> 00:19:07.280]   So they were really struggling.
[00:19:07.280 --> 00:19:08.280]   I can just imagine.
[00:19:08.280 --> 00:19:11.280]   She said, "What?"
[00:19:11.280 --> 00:19:14.800]   And so, you know, you just got to have compassion for Martha.
[00:19:14.800 --> 00:19:16.760]   I mean, poor Martha.
[00:19:16.760 --> 00:19:18.400]   How did she get here anyway?
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:22.480]   Can you identify with Martha?
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:27.600]   So here's some circumstances that I think influenced her ungodly concern.
[00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:35.320]   I think really part of the pressure for her, and it happens to us as well, is that it kind
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:41.360]   of appears from her reaction that she just felt under pressure from a few things.
[00:19:41.360 --> 00:19:45.880]   The first thing it could have been was that just the circumstance that she found herself
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:50.600]   in, you know, I'm sure it was hard when she realized all these people were going to be
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:51.600]   showing up.
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:55.320]   I mean, she wanted that, but at the same time, it was probably a lot of pressure to have
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:59.080]   a lot of people and the Lord come to your house.
[00:19:59.080 --> 00:20:02.280]   Also, just the culture in which she lived.
[00:20:02.280 --> 00:20:04.440]   You know, culture's hard.
[00:20:04.440 --> 00:20:07.920]   Sometimes culture really plays into pressure.
[00:20:07.920 --> 00:20:11.680]   Culture doesn't trump the word of God, but culture can definitely be an influence, and
[00:20:11.680 --> 00:20:14.960]   I think you know what I mean when I say that.
[00:20:14.960 --> 00:20:18.600]   So she had a particular culture that was—there were certain things that were expected of
[00:20:18.600 --> 00:20:20.200]   her.
[00:20:20.200 --> 00:20:24.000]   It was probably just the importance of the guests that she was serving.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:26.480]   I'm sure that was a lot of pressure that happened.
[00:20:26.480 --> 00:20:29.280]   Sometimes we have the—I don't know, what would we liken it to?
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:32.800]   Sometimes we feel pressure and we have certain people come over.
[00:20:32.800 --> 00:20:36.520]   Maybe it's your in-laws for the first time or a new friend, you know, or the pastor and
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:38.720]   his wife or something like that.
[00:20:38.720 --> 00:20:40.880]   Just the importance of the guests.
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:45.120]   I think another pressure could be just the desire to serve the Lord.
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:46.120]   That can be a pressure.
[00:20:46.120 --> 00:20:49.380]   You just want to serve the Lord wholeheartedly.
[00:20:49.380 --> 00:20:51.600]   And then of course, self-imposed expectations.
[00:20:51.600 --> 00:20:53.600]   We just do it to ourselves all the time.
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:55.440]   Why do we do that to ourselves, ladies?
[00:20:55.440 --> 00:20:59.000]   Why do we impose these expectations on ourselves?
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.140]   That is such a killer, it seems.
[00:21:02.140 --> 00:21:08.480]   So there's five possibilities, but instead of really focusing on what's truly important,
[00:21:08.480 --> 00:21:15.320]   like Mary seemed to recognize that day, Martha allowed herself to be distracted by the preparations
[00:21:15.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   and her serving.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:21.960]   And now what we're seeing is it's just yielding this sinful fruit in her life.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:26.640]   And it's really weighing her heart down with anxiety, which ultimately for her would
[00:21:26.640 --> 00:21:29.200]   be pride because she's trying to control something.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:33.200]   She's not leaning on the sovereign Lord for help.
[00:21:33.200 --> 00:21:37.880]   Doesn't she believe that Jesus could make dinner just like that?
[00:21:37.880 --> 00:21:40.080]   I mean, seriously.
[00:21:40.080 --> 00:21:45.840]   So anyways, like I said, I think Martha had as an original heart motive really to honor
[00:21:45.840 --> 00:21:48.320]   the Lord, no doubt in my mind.
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:49.540]   She loved Him.
[00:21:49.540 --> 00:21:50.540]   We love the Lord.
[00:21:50.540 --> 00:21:52.620]   We have these great intentions.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:58.440]   And I think she had great plans of just seeking to help and minister to others like we do
[00:21:58.440 --> 00:21:59.440]   at times.
[00:21:59.440 --> 00:22:04.360]   But now in this moment, she's unfortunately sinning to do it.
[00:22:04.360 --> 00:22:06.560]   So have you ever been there?
[00:22:06.560 --> 00:22:08.080]   Anybody want to say guilty?
[00:22:08.080 --> 00:22:09.080]   Guilty!
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:12.000]   Been there so many times I can't even tell you.
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:14.800]   We start out with the greatest of intentions.
[00:22:14.800 --> 00:22:20.040]   We really want to serve people and then we end up sinning in the process.
[00:22:20.040 --> 00:22:24.040]   So I know we've all been there and we've just fallen into the same trap.
[00:22:24.040 --> 00:22:25.960]   We just get busy in our life.
[00:22:25.960 --> 00:22:32.480]   We get caught up in the busyness of life or in the busyness of ministry.
[00:22:32.480 --> 00:22:33.480]   And you know how it is.
[00:22:33.480 --> 00:22:34.880]   You volunteer to do something.
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:35.880]   You know, you start out great.
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:41.160]   You volunteer to do that ministry task or you work hard at serving your families.
[00:22:41.160 --> 00:22:45.480]   And the problem is you have expectations of other people though within that context.
[00:22:45.480 --> 00:22:50.560]   And when they don't rise to the occasion, we suddenly just find out, wow, there's just
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:52.480]   no joy doing this anymore.
[00:22:52.480 --> 00:22:53.480]   There's no peace.
[00:22:53.480 --> 00:22:56.440]   I'm just really anxious and upset.
[00:22:56.440 --> 00:23:01.080]   So I would say that while it's true that there were cultural expectations of Martha in that
[00:23:01.080 --> 00:23:09.200]   day as there are in our own roles as wives and mothers and daughters, sisters, students,
[00:23:09.200 --> 00:23:15.080]   employees, I think probably the bigger thing was probably just the self-imposed expectations
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:17.600]   that she placed upon herself.
[00:23:17.600 --> 00:23:21.440]   So that might be something you can think through with somebody that's anxious.
[00:23:21.440 --> 00:23:22.880]   Maybe that's the issue.
[00:23:22.880 --> 00:23:26.120]   They've really just self-imposed some things.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:27.960]   And let's just kind of talk through that a little bit.
[00:23:27.960 --> 00:23:34.920]   You know, you can ask her, what are some things that you were hoping or wanting that you're
[00:23:34.920 --> 00:23:35.920]   not getting?
[00:23:35.920 --> 00:23:42.000]   And you know, in Martha's case, do you see in the text anywhere that she ever asked Mary
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:43.000]   for help?
[00:23:43.000 --> 00:23:44.000]   Did she ever ask?
[00:23:44.000 --> 00:23:46.880]   I mean, she just expected, right?
[00:23:46.880 --> 00:23:49.480]   She didn't actually ask her.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:54.280]   So it's possible that she just expected Mary to help, which would have probably been expected
[00:23:54.280 --> 00:23:55.720]   in that day.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:59.400]   But when Mary didn't rise to the occasion, Martha just lost it.
[00:23:59.400 --> 00:24:03.880]   So it's yielding sinful anger at this point.
[00:24:03.880 --> 00:24:09.200]   And her distraction over much serving made something other than Jesus the focus of her
[00:24:09.200 --> 00:24:10.200]   heart.
[00:24:10.200 --> 00:24:11.200]   And that's the problem.
[00:24:11.200 --> 00:24:17.240]   Jesus is no longer the focus of your attention and your heart.
[00:24:17.240 --> 00:24:19.920]   It's more centered on self.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:26.520]   But you know, thankfully, we have this gentle rebuke that Jesus, who is all wise and all
[00:24:26.520 --> 00:24:28.680]   knowing, gives us in verse 49.
[00:24:28.680 --> 00:24:31.160]   And look, or verse 41, look at that again.
[00:24:31.160 --> 00:24:33.560]   What is he saying?
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:38.880]   He says, "Martha, Martha, you are anxious, or we could say worried and bothered about
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:41.520]   so many things.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:46.840]   But only one thing is necessary for Mary has chosen the good part, which shall not be taken
[00:24:46.840 --> 00:24:49.000]   away from her."
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:53.400]   The word that Jesus uses for anxious is the same word that we've been learning about.
[00:24:53.400 --> 00:24:59.240]   It means to care for or to be concerned about some kind of future event.
[00:24:59.240 --> 00:25:02.160]   And that's what Martha was really intently concerned about.
[00:25:02.160 --> 00:25:07.040]   She was intently concerned about getting this dinner on the table, probably.
[00:25:07.040 --> 00:25:11.880]   And so, you know, I would say, hmm, probably started off as godly concern.
[00:25:11.880 --> 00:25:13.160]   You know, we're wanting to serve others.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.540]   I could see how that would be a part of what we do.
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:24.200]   But in that process of godly concern, it just kind of manifested into ingodly concern.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:30.840]   The same word that Jesus uses for anxiety in verse 31 also appears in Luke 12, 22.
[00:25:30.840 --> 00:25:37.200]   And in the same way there, as Jesus exhorts Martha in Luke, he's exhorting his disciples
[00:25:37.200 --> 00:25:39.400]   not to be anxious about their life.
[00:25:39.400 --> 00:25:42.680]   It might be a passage that you're familiar with.
[00:25:42.680 --> 00:25:47.240]   But he tells them, too, that they ought to be, instead of being anxious about your life,
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:51.160]   what we ought to be doing is we ought to be seeking the kingdom.
[00:25:51.160 --> 00:25:54.880]   And all those things that we're so worried about, like food and clothing and all those
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:57.280]   things, would be added unto us.
[00:25:57.280 --> 00:26:01.160]   And that's something that you can emphasize with people that you want to help.
[00:26:01.160 --> 00:26:05.160]   You know, take them to great passages like Luke 12 or take them to great passages like
[00:26:05.160 --> 00:26:08.960]   Matthew 6, and let's just see what Jesus says about the issue.
[00:26:08.960 --> 00:26:14.520]   I mean, he talks about the Lord cares for two little birds.
[00:26:14.520 --> 00:26:17.200]   Don't you think he's going to care for you?
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:21.520]   You know, and you can kind of walk them through that practically.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:24.600]   And that's just something that we need to emphasize.
[00:26:24.600 --> 00:26:30.120]   And you know, by the way, when you worry about your life, does it add anything to your life,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:31.120]   positively speaking?
[00:26:31.120 --> 00:26:32.120]   What do you think?
[00:26:32.120 --> 00:26:37.420]   Does it add even any—how about, does it add gray hair to your life?
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.960]   Does it add ulcers to your life?
[00:26:40.960 --> 00:26:43.240]   Does it keep you up at night?
[00:26:43.240 --> 00:26:44.920]   Sleepless nights, I mean?
[00:26:44.920 --> 00:26:49.200]   Man, it doesn't add anything well to our lives in a positive way.
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:52.280]   It only adds trouble when we worry about our life.
[00:26:52.280 --> 00:26:58.560]   So Proverbs 27, 15, "Do not boast about tomorrow, for you don't know what a day will bring."
[00:26:58.560 --> 00:27:00.080]   So live in the present.
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:04.040]   Trust the Lord for what he gives you today.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:08.000]   And the right course would be to seek his kingdom first, and God will see to the other
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:13.400]   things, which is what Jesus speaks to us as we read that entire narrative, if you get
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:17.960]   a chance, in your own just time in Luke 12.
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:23.400]   But kind of getting back to our text, Jesus is really communicating the same principle
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:28.120]   to Martha as he did to his disciples in Luke 12.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:33.880]   You know, really, Martha, you know, instead of being anxious—you know, you can put your
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:39.020]   name in there, really, Shelby, instead of being anxious, there's really only one thing
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:40.020]   that's necessary.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.760]   Look at your sister.
[00:27:41.760 --> 00:27:46.920]   She's chosen the good portion, or the good part, which isn't going to be taken away
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.280]   from her.
[00:27:48.280 --> 00:27:54.600]   And probably Martha was taken aback by that a little bit, by that response, because she
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:57.600]   probably believed that she was really doing the right thing.
[00:27:57.600 --> 00:28:02.480]   And she started out doing the right thing, for sure, so she was probably taken aback.
[00:28:02.480 --> 00:28:06.160]   And of course, you know, Jesus is admonishing her here.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:08.680]   So we talked about admonishment last night, right?
[00:28:08.680 --> 00:28:11.840]   So here's an example of when Jesus admonished somebody.
[00:28:11.840 --> 00:28:15.640]   But in this case, it's a gentle rebuke.
[00:28:15.640 --> 00:28:19.960]   He's trying to encourage her in that, you know, she is being anxious.
[00:28:19.960 --> 00:28:25.760]   And so he is trying to help penetrate straight to her heart, and I'm sure it did.
[00:28:25.760 --> 00:28:29.600]   And the reason why I know it did is because she did another dinner about eight months
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:30.600]   later.
[00:28:30.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Okay?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.320]   And you can read about that on your own in John 12.
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:43.040]   But when she had this dinner, Jesus came again to visit Martha, Mary, and Lazarus, and it
[00:28:43.040 --> 00:28:50.280]   was six days before his Passover, or six days before the last Passover of his earthly life.
[00:28:50.280 --> 00:28:57.240]   And so they gave another dinner, and while the disciples were there and Martha served,
[00:28:57.240 --> 00:28:59.560]   Mary was anointing Jesus' feet.
[00:28:59.560 --> 00:29:04.020]   You recall that passage, when Mary did that?
[00:29:04.020 --> 00:29:05.020]   And who was complaining?
[00:29:05.020 --> 00:29:07.640]   Do you remember Martha complaining during that dinner?
[00:29:07.640 --> 00:29:10.800]   Do you remember who was complaining?
[00:29:10.800 --> 00:29:15.040]   Who was complaining about that anointment, the perfume?
[00:29:15.040 --> 00:29:17.640]   Judas, right?
[00:29:17.640 --> 00:29:18.760]   Yeah.
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:22.120]   He was the one that was complaining.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:25.400]   But Martha, on the other hand, she was holding her peace.
[00:29:25.400 --> 00:29:28.080]   She wasn't anxious.
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:31.760]   She appeared quite content to serve the Lord.
[00:29:31.760 --> 00:29:36.960]   And the reason why is because she understood, finally, the importance of the occasion, because
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:41.800]   in a very short time, Christ would be crucified.
[00:29:41.800 --> 00:29:46.360]   You know, this narrative here, although it's small, and it's really taken from one day
[00:29:46.360 --> 00:29:50.400]   in a life of a woman, it has such huge impacts.
[00:29:50.400 --> 00:29:56.040]   It had a huge impact on me personally when I first studied it, but it has a huge impact
[00:29:56.040 --> 00:30:00.160]   on women if you really take the time to study it deeply.
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:08.000]   I remember, just on a personal note, that where it had an impact on me was when my husband,
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.520]   back in 2008, if, you know, a lot of you are so young, you might have been really little,
[00:30:11.520 --> 00:30:17.160]   but for those of you that are married and were around in 2008, we went through a recession
[00:30:17.160 --> 00:30:18.160]   in California.
[00:30:18.160 --> 00:30:19.160]   You recall?
[00:30:19.160 --> 00:30:25.160]   My husband's an electrical contractor, and he was out of work for an entire year.
[00:30:25.160 --> 00:30:28.680]   And that's pretty devastating in the state of California, because it's so expensive to
[00:30:28.680 --> 00:30:30.320]   live here, right?
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:31.760]   I wasn't working at the time.
[00:30:31.760 --> 00:30:36.920]   I was home, still raising a daughter that was in junior high at the time.
[00:30:36.920 --> 00:30:41.760]   And so when that happened, I became anxious over my life.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:47.440]   And the reason why is because I was more focused on losing earthly treasure, right?
[00:30:47.440 --> 00:30:52.440]   Because you start thinking, like, ridiculous thoughts, like, you know, am I going to be
[00:30:52.440 --> 00:30:53.440]   thrown out?
[00:30:53.440 --> 00:30:55.480]   You know, am I going to be homeless?
[00:30:55.480 --> 00:30:59.380]   Am I going to, you know, you just, you start getting very exaggerated in your thinking.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:03.880]   And that was really, literally dragging me away from the most important treasure in my
[00:31:03.880 --> 00:31:05.200]   life, which is Christ.
[00:31:05.200 --> 00:31:10.080]   And so I had to sit at Christ's feet, and I had to repent of that idolatry, because
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:13.800]   that's what was driving the anxiety in my life.
[00:31:13.800 --> 00:31:17.580]   And I had to allow Christ to minister to me at a heart level.
[00:31:17.580 --> 00:31:22.000]   And that's what's so wonderful about spending time with the Lord, because He becomes your
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:24.680]   anchor in the storm.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:32.040]   And He is that to many, many people, of course, and was to me as well.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:36.680]   So that's definitely an important passage that I would take a woman to if she's steeped
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.280]   pretty strongly in anxiety.
[00:31:39.280 --> 00:31:45.840]   I'd want to minister to her, because Jesus is ministering to her and to both of them,
[00:31:45.840 --> 00:31:47.240]   and it's just a good thing to look at.
[00:31:47.240 --> 00:31:51.600]   But in addition to Luke 10, another great text that we can turn to and kind of look
[00:31:51.600 --> 00:31:54.240]   on this issue of anxiety is Matthew 6.
[00:31:54.240 --> 00:32:03.200]   So let's turn there for a minute and kind of center your eyes on verses 25, and I'll
[00:32:03.200 --> 00:32:05.760]   take it through to 34.
[00:32:05.760 --> 00:32:10.960]   We'll just kind of take a brief look, but it's just a great passage, again, for you
[00:32:10.960 --> 00:32:15.680]   to think through and study this portion of Christ.
[00:32:15.680 --> 00:32:19.680]   This is part of the Sermon of the Mount that you can apply to your own life.
[00:32:19.680 --> 00:32:25.640]   But the first thing I want to point out is that worrying or being anxious is just so
[00:32:25.640 --> 00:32:28.180]   unproductive in our life.
[00:32:28.180 --> 00:32:29.320]   That would be the first thing.
[00:32:29.320 --> 00:32:35.680]   So let's look at Matthew 6, 25 to 34, and I'm going to read—by the time you kind of
[00:32:35.680 --> 00:32:42.000]   get to verse 25, He's really telling the crowd and the disciples and all of us why being
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.660]   anxious is just foolish.
[00:32:44.660 --> 00:32:51.640]   And the first reason He gives why it's foolish comes out in verse 27, where He says, "And
[00:32:51.640 --> 00:32:56.960]   who of you, by being worried, can add even a single hour to his life?"
[00:32:56.960 --> 00:33:02.980]   And of course, I already kind of made a joke about that, but He's just saying, you know,
[00:33:02.980 --> 00:33:09.300]   all this worrying and all this anxiety that we engage in accomplishes absolutely nothing.
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:11.060]   It really doesn't.
[00:33:11.060 --> 00:33:17.540]   It just works you up, and like we said, it leads to things, complicated issues in our
[00:33:17.540 --> 00:33:20.900]   life, conflict, physical issues.
[00:33:20.900 --> 00:33:22.280]   I see that.
[00:33:22.280 --> 00:33:29.660]   When people come in and see me and they're just—and anxiety is their thing—usually
[00:33:29.660 --> 00:33:34.100]   they're not sleeping, and that can cause other problems, because if you get a person that's
[00:33:34.100 --> 00:33:38.140]   just not sleeping, it usually manifests into depression and things like that.
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.140]   It spirals.
[00:33:39.140 --> 00:33:42.900]   And, you know, they're just struggling so much.
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:47.900]   But anyway, if we jump down to 34, let's see what Jesus says there.
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:54.060]   He says, "So do not worry about tomorrow, for tomorrow will care for itself.
[00:33:54.060 --> 00:33:57.260]   Each day has enough trouble of its own."
[00:33:57.260 --> 00:34:02.380]   And so what we learn there is that anxiety or worry is really unproductive because it's
[00:34:02.380 --> 00:34:04.420]   a thief of your time.
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:07.660]   Just think about how much time you've lost when you've sat there and really worried
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:09.540]   about something.
[00:34:09.540 --> 00:34:13.140]   You know, I mean, it's such a bummer when we think through that.
[00:34:13.140 --> 00:34:18.300]   And again, kind of pointing back to my own testimony when my husband lost his job—and
[00:34:18.300 --> 00:34:24.180]   by the way, he's doing fine now, but like 15 years ago—I lost a lot of time worrying
[00:34:24.180 --> 00:34:29.780]   about my life because I was so consumed with just thinking and dwelling on all of these
[00:34:29.780 --> 00:34:31.860]   what-ifs.
[00:34:31.860 --> 00:34:35.740]   And I would be willing to bet that a lot of you are probably consumed that way, and you
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.060]   probably have friends in your life that are the same.
[00:34:38.060 --> 00:34:39.980]   It's just a common thing that we do.
[00:34:39.980 --> 00:34:43.940]   So it's very unproductive because it's a thief of your time.
[00:34:43.940 --> 00:34:47.600]   It's also very unnecessary.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:51.180]   So let's look at verses 28 to 30 now.
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:53.940]   Jesus says, "And why are you worried about clothing?
[00:34:53.940 --> 00:34:56.620]   Observe how the lilies of the field grow.
[00:34:56.620 --> 00:34:59.020]   They do not toil, nor do they spin.
[00:34:59.020 --> 00:35:03.940]   Yet I say to you that not even Solomon in all his glory clothed himself like one of
[00:35:03.940 --> 00:35:05.220]   these.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:09.540]   But if God so clothes the grass of the field, which is alive today and tomorrow is thrown
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:15.900]   into the furnace, will he not much more clothe you, O you of little faith?"
[00:35:15.900 --> 00:35:23.100]   And so Jesus is just saying there that worrying or being anxious about your life is just unnecessary
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:28.740]   because God is completely able and He's completely trustworthy to provide for your
[00:35:28.740 --> 00:35:29.740]   needs.
[00:35:29.740 --> 00:35:35.060]   So why do you fret over things that you're going to wear or eat or drink, you know, specifically
[00:35:35.060 --> 00:35:36.060]   in the passage?
[00:35:36.060 --> 00:35:38.860]   I mean, don't you believe that God's concerned for you?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:39.860]   Don't you believe that?
[00:35:39.860 --> 00:35:44.660]   So a lot of times when we struggle this way, it's really the sin of unbelief, right?
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:48.060]   Because we're failing to believe that God is good and that God is sovereign and that
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:49.780]   God is trustworthy.
[00:35:49.780 --> 00:35:51.260]   That's where a lot of that comes from.
[00:35:51.260 --> 00:35:56.220]   But don't you believe that God is concerned for you and He's more than able to take care
[00:35:56.220 --> 00:35:57.420]   of those things.
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:36:04.120]   In fact, it kind of comes to mind when I think about things like this is 1 Peter 5, 7 when
[00:36:04.120 --> 00:36:10.100]   Peter says, "Humble yourselves in the sight of the Lord and He will exalt you in due time
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.060]   by casting your cares on Him who cares for you."
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:18.180]   And so when we don't cast our cares on our sovereign Lord, we're actually struggling
[00:36:18.180 --> 00:36:22.620]   with pride in that way because we're trying to take care of things in our own strength
[00:36:22.620 --> 00:36:24.940]   and we succumb to that ungodly concern.
[00:36:24.940 --> 00:36:29.460]   So it's really about the sin of unbelief at times.
[00:36:29.460 --> 00:36:36.940]   The point three there, Jesus says that anxiety is foolish because it's unbecoming.
[00:36:36.940 --> 00:36:40.980]   And the reason why is because it focuses on what one doesn't have.
[00:36:40.980 --> 00:36:45.020]   And so let's look at verses 31 to 32 now.
[00:36:45.020 --> 00:36:49.180]   Do not worry then saying, "What will we eat or what will we drink or what will we wear
[00:36:49.180 --> 00:36:50.180]   for clothing?
[00:36:50.180 --> 00:36:56.180]   For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things, for your heavenly Father knows that you need
[00:36:56.180 --> 00:36:58.280]   all those things."
[00:36:58.280 --> 00:37:02.660]   And so He's just trying to point out that being anxious about what you're going to eat
[00:37:02.660 --> 00:37:06.380]   or drink is really a focus on earthly values.
[00:37:06.380 --> 00:37:10.420]   You're really kind of focused just on things that aren't eternal.
[00:37:10.420 --> 00:37:15.740]   And sometimes with the issue of anxiety or worry, it stems from the fact that your focus
[00:37:15.740 --> 00:37:22.940]   is too much on earthly treasure or the gifts and not the giver, we would say.
[00:37:22.940 --> 00:37:27.960]   And it's also very unbecoming because when you engage in sinful anxiety, you act as if
[00:37:27.960 --> 00:37:30.300]   you have no hope.
[00:37:30.300 --> 00:37:31.300]   And that's a problem, right?
[00:37:31.300 --> 00:37:32.840]   Because of course we have hope.
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.060]   We have Christ.
[00:37:35.060 --> 00:37:40.460]   So kind of to sum up here, here are just some truths I gleaned from my study of Luke and
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:44.220]   Matthew as far as sinful anxiety.
[00:37:44.220 --> 00:37:45.780]   I'm pretty sure it's on your outline.
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:48.020]   I didn't look, but let's see how it goes.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:54.400]   The first thing is that I know I'm being anxious, sinfully anxious anyway, when my thoughts
[00:37:54.400 --> 00:37:58.360]   are focused on trying to change the future.
[00:37:58.360 --> 00:38:03.960]   So when you're doing heart examination, you can think through that because in many situations,
[00:38:03.960 --> 00:38:09.120]   women are leaning too much on their own understanding and they look for ways to get out of the mess
[00:38:09.120 --> 00:38:15.120]   they're in and they expend a lot of energy trying to solve things in their own strength
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:22.800]   versus seeking God's kingdom first and sitting at Jesus' feet and learning from His word
[00:38:22.800 --> 00:38:24.920]   and praying especially.
[00:38:24.920 --> 00:38:30.000]   It really exhibits a low view of God when you're not doing that because you forget that
[00:38:30.000 --> 00:38:32.840]   He's sovereign and in control.
[00:38:32.840 --> 00:38:37.440]   Secondly, as we've just discussed, you'll know that you are anxious when you recognize that
[00:38:37.440 --> 00:38:40.240]   your thoughts are just simply unproductive.
[00:38:40.240 --> 00:38:45.440]   You know, when you start examining your thought life, you know, maybe you are allowing yourself
[00:38:45.440 --> 00:38:46.760]   to go into the land of what ifs.
[00:38:46.760 --> 00:38:48.640]   I mean, am I just making this up?
[00:38:48.640 --> 00:38:51.760]   Do you guys go into the land of what ifs when you're anxious?
[00:38:51.760 --> 00:39:00.240]   We just create these negative scenarios that aren't true and we just envision all these
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:04.640]   horrible things that are going to happen to us that just aren't true.
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:09.080]   And at the heart level, that's a struggle again with wanting to trust the Lord and wanting
[00:39:09.080 --> 00:39:10.080]   to be in control.
[00:39:10.080 --> 00:39:15.040]   So remember, notice the first two things I talked about, that has to do with your thinking.
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:19.320]   So again, the battle is in the mind as far as that goes.
[00:39:19.320 --> 00:39:23.080]   Thirdly, anxiety controls you instead of you controlling it.
[00:39:23.080 --> 00:39:25.920]   You ever notice that?
[00:39:25.920 --> 00:39:27.640]   It's a very controlling thing.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:32.160]   It can be controlling like it controlled Martha because it can dictate the next move that
[00:39:32.160 --> 00:39:33.900]   you make.
[00:39:33.900 --> 00:39:37.200]   When you succumb to it, it will dictate your next move.
[00:39:37.200 --> 00:39:42.120]   And then fourth, being anxious could actually lead you to neglect your responsibilities
[00:39:42.120 --> 00:39:44.240]   and your relationships.
[00:39:44.240 --> 00:39:48.720]   When you're consumed with yourself and have anxiety, you're more than likely exhausted
[00:39:48.720 --> 00:39:55.200]   and you're very distracted and so you're really not serving, you're neglecting responsibilities
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:56.600]   and that can be in a whole bunch of ways.
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:01.780]   It could be at home, it could be at church, whatever, but it can lead to other things.
[00:40:01.780 --> 00:40:07.160]   And then five, anxiety can just damage your body physically.
[00:40:07.160 --> 00:40:10.160]   That's something to kind of think through.
[00:40:10.160 --> 00:40:13.880]   Excessive anxiety really does manifest into physical problems.
[00:40:13.880 --> 00:40:16.080]   We are body-soul creatures.
[00:40:16.080 --> 00:40:21.200]   Physical problems will have an impact on your physical body and vice versa, but this is
[00:40:21.200 --> 00:40:25.440]   a spiritual issue and it will manifest into a physical issue.
[00:40:25.440 --> 00:40:28.460]   And I just named a few, but I know there's all kinds of things.
[00:40:28.460 --> 00:40:34.120]   If you're chronically fatigued, that is a manifestation of being simply anxious.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:42.480]   If you have trouble just even with insomnia, just not sleeping, that could be a reason.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:44.800]   Anxiety can also lead to a loss of hope.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:49.860]   So instead of finding answers, you spend your time worrying and fretting about your future
[00:40:49.860 --> 00:40:54.200]   rather than looking to Christ for your hope in his word.
[00:40:54.200 --> 00:40:56.800]   And when you don't do that, you feel hopeless.
[00:40:56.800 --> 00:41:00.400]   And so that can be a really scary place for many people because it can lead them into
[00:41:00.400 --> 00:41:02.280]   suicidal thinking.
[00:41:02.280 --> 00:41:05.580]   I actually lost a friend to suicide because of that.
[00:41:05.580 --> 00:41:09.320]   They just let their thoughts consume them and they just didn't deal with it and it took
[00:41:09.320 --> 00:41:10.640]   them down the wrong road.
[00:41:10.640 --> 00:41:13.000]   So you've got to be careful.
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:18.240]   So we spent a great deal of time discussing how anxiety is defined in the Bible.
[00:41:18.240 --> 00:41:20.080]   It can be a godly concern.
[00:41:20.080 --> 00:41:22.360]   It can be an ungodly concern.
[00:41:22.360 --> 00:41:26.980]   But for our purposes today, I want to just take a closer look at how sinful anxiety and
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.920]   ungodly concern manifest in a life of a woman.
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:34.080]   That's why we looked at Martha and how Jesus responded to her.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.600]   And now we're just going to kind of end our time with good old-fashioned applications.
[00:41:37.600 --> 00:41:43.200]   So turn to go back to Philippians 4.
[00:41:43.200 --> 00:41:47.040]   What kind of biblical counselor would I be if I didn't give you practical application,
[00:41:47.040 --> 00:41:48.040]   right?
[00:41:48.040 --> 00:41:49.460]   All right.
[00:41:49.460 --> 00:41:50.880]   So let's look at Philippians 4.
[00:41:50.880 --> 00:41:53.400]   This will be super helpful.
[00:41:53.400 --> 00:42:02.080]   Something that I talk to counselees about constantly and from my own heart as well.
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.560]   Okay.
[00:42:03.560 --> 00:42:05.600]   Starting in verse 4 of Philippians 4.
[00:42:05.600 --> 00:42:07.600]   "Rejoice in the Lord always.
[00:42:07.600 --> 00:42:09.280]   Again, I will say, rejoice.
[00:42:09.280 --> 00:42:11.320]   Let your reasonableness be known to everyone.
[00:42:11.320 --> 00:42:12.320]   The Lord is at hand.
[00:42:12.320 --> 00:42:17.960]   Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving,
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:20.280]   let your requests be made known to God.
[00:42:20.280 --> 00:42:24.040]   And the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:25.680]   your minds in Christ Jesus.
[00:42:25.680 --> 00:42:30.480]   Finally, brothers, whatever is true, whatever is honorable, whatever is just, whatever is
[00:42:30.480 --> 00:42:36.480]   pure, whatever is lovely, whatever is commendable, if there is any excellence, if there is anything
[00:42:36.480 --> 00:42:39.720]   worthy of praise, think about these things.
[00:42:39.720 --> 00:42:44.640]   What you have learned and received and heard and seen in me, practice these things and
[00:42:44.640 --> 00:42:47.520]   the peace of God will be with you."
[00:42:47.520 --> 00:42:48.520]   Okay.
[00:42:48.520 --> 00:42:50.800]   So really quick.
[00:42:50.800 --> 00:42:52.420]   First point, right response.
[00:42:52.420 --> 00:42:56.360]   We need to have a right response to and an awareness of God.
[00:42:56.360 --> 00:42:59.480]   That's what verses 4 to 5 is talking about.
[00:42:59.480 --> 00:43:04.080]   Instead of succumbing to anxiety, we're to have a right response and an awareness to
[00:43:04.080 --> 00:43:05.080]   God.
[00:43:05.080 --> 00:43:11.640]   Paul is calling the believer to rejoice in the Lord twice, which is really a present
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:14.320]   active imperative, which means it's a command.
[00:43:14.320 --> 00:43:20.620]   And so all of us, as we know, to rejoice simply means to be glad or to welcome.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.160]   And he's really emphasizing that by saying it twice.
[00:43:24.160 --> 00:43:31.240]   So even when you are faced with difficulty, you can encourage others, yourself to rejoice
[00:43:31.240 --> 00:43:35.880]   and just let your reasonableness be known to everyone because the Lord is at hand.
[00:43:35.880 --> 00:43:40.320]   And what he's saying there is he's saying, "Look, the Lord is omnipresent.
[00:43:40.320 --> 00:43:42.440]   He is near to you.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.960]   His nearness is your good."
[00:43:43.960 --> 00:43:49.880]   So instead of being caught up in this anxious thinking, you need to stop and you need to
[00:43:49.880 --> 00:43:50.880]   have a right awareness.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:54.560]   I mean, my goodness, why are you living as if the Lord is not near?
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.120]   Because that's really the issue.
[00:43:56.120 --> 00:44:01.200]   But rather you can rejoice in the fact that he is near and so you can let that reasonableness
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:02.200]   be known.
[00:44:02.200 --> 00:44:03.960]   That's having a right view.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:07.040]   Just trying to train someone to have a right view, even when they're in trial.
[00:44:07.040 --> 00:44:08.160]   We can have joy in trials.
[00:44:08.160 --> 00:44:13.760]   We're not all so excited to be in a trial, but we can have joy in the trial because theologically
[00:44:13.760 --> 00:44:19.520]   we know that God is working through the trial and he's there to provide a way of escape.
[00:44:19.520 --> 00:44:21.320]   The next one is right praying.
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:23.360]   That's where verses six to seven comes in.
[00:44:23.360 --> 00:44:26.800]   You are to have right praying.
[00:44:26.800 --> 00:44:28.760]   Verse six begins with another command.
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:33.980]   It says, "Do not be anxious," similar to what Jesus taught in Sermon on the Mount.
[00:44:33.980 --> 00:44:40.560]   But in this case, the believer is being called to put off anxiousness and to instead put
[00:44:40.560 --> 00:44:42.800]   on prayer with thanksgiving.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:43.800]   Okay?
[00:44:43.800 --> 00:44:49.440]   So as we lay aside our anxiety and renew our mind in the scriptures, we put on prayer with
[00:44:49.440 --> 00:44:54.440]   thanksgiving and that means to have gratitude at a heart level to the Father.
[00:44:54.440 --> 00:44:56.800]   There are so many things we can be thankful for, ladies.
[00:44:56.800 --> 00:44:57.800]   Can you imagine?
[00:44:57.800 --> 00:45:00.200]   What if we just sat here for the next hour and just wrote out lists of all the things
[00:45:00.200 --> 00:45:01.200]   we're thankful for?
[00:45:01.200 --> 00:45:04.160]   You think you'd have some things to say?
[00:45:04.160 --> 00:45:06.320]   And that's kind of what he's talking about.
[00:45:06.320 --> 00:45:12.280]   Too often when we're in trials, we just get very self-focused and we lack gratitude, quite
[00:45:12.280 --> 00:45:13.280]   frankly.
[00:45:13.280 --> 00:45:16.640]   It gets to be too much about you.
[00:45:16.640 --> 00:45:20.960]   But if you can have right praying, what follows is peace.
[00:45:20.960 --> 00:45:26.480]   And that's that divine peace from God which excels our understanding and guards our hearts
[00:45:26.480 --> 00:45:27.480]   in Christ.
[00:45:27.480 --> 00:45:29.360]   It's kind of a military term.
[00:45:29.360 --> 00:45:35.200]   It just kind of implies that peace is standing on duty to keep out anything that brings ungodly
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:36.320]   concern.
[00:45:36.320 --> 00:45:40.240]   The next thing in verse eight is he says you must have right dwelling.
[00:45:40.240 --> 00:45:44.840]   And so you've got all of those wonderful commands in verse eight that tell you how to think.
[00:45:44.840 --> 00:45:48.840]   You want to think true thoughts and honorable thoughts and just thoughts and lovely thoughts
[00:45:48.840 --> 00:45:52.800]   and commendable thoughts and excellent thoughts and worthy of praise thoughts.
[00:45:52.800 --> 00:45:56.680]   Those are actually the standards for Christian thinking.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:59.040]   So that's important to emphasize in your own life.
[00:45:59.040 --> 00:46:00.440]   You can make that super practical.
[00:46:00.440 --> 00:46:02.000]   I wish we kind of had time to do that.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:05.440]   Maybe I have that set up in the questions you're going to go through together.
[00:46:05.440 --> 00:46:08.160]   But that's just important.
[00:46:08.160 --> 00:46:12.000]   Let's just talk about how to apply that.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:15.680]   And I'm not talking about cognitive behavioral therapy because they'll try to train you to
[00:46:15.680 --> 00:46:16.880]   think differently.
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:23.040]   I'm talking about getting at the heart level and really, really being able to renew your
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:26.960]   mind because that's what the Holy Spirit does is he renews your mind and helps you to do
[00:46:26.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   those things.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:32.120]   And so not only are we to have a right response.
[00:46:32.120 --> 00:46:35.040]   So you know you're tempted to be anxious.
[00:46:35.040 --> 00:46:37.520]   So you start thinking about how can I have a right response.
[00:46:37.520 --> 00:46:42.320]   I need to think, have a right view of God, have an awareness of God.
[00:46:42.320 --> 00:46:44.440]   I need to pray, have right praying.
[00:46:44.440 --> 00:46:48.360]   I need to begin to dwell on right things because your mind is beginning to go into the land
[00:46:48.360 --> 00:46:49.680]   of what ifs.
[00:46:49.680 --> 00:46:53.980]   And then finally Paul says we're to put on a right practice.
[00:46:53.980 --> 00:46:56.600]   And that's where verse 9 comes in.
[00:46:56.600 --> 00:47:02.200]   Paul is saying not only are we to learn these things, but we're to practice these things.
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:04.600]   So it's not just intellectual stuff.
[00:47:04.600 --> 00:47:07.380]   We're actually to put this into practice.
[00:47:07.380 --> 00:47:13.760]   And so make sure that when you are applying this to your life that you are actually practicing
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:18.360]   and walking out these truths, actually doing it.
[00:47:18.360 --> 00:47:20.520]   Try to make it as practical as you can.
[00:47:20.520 --> 00:47:21.520]   Okay.
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:26.200]   Man, covered a lot in the probably a little less than an hour.
[00:47:26.200 --> 00:47:27.680]   I didn't want to go as long this time.
[00:47:27.680 --> 00:47:31.000]   I don't want you guys to fall asleep on me.
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:33.200]   But that's just some practical stuff.
[00:47:33.200 --> 00:47:38.120]   And I think probably where this is really going to hit home is just you in your groups
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:40.880]   kind of talking some of these things out.
[00:47:40.880 --> 00:47:44.200]   And let's see how many questions I've got for you this time.
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.960]   Let's see.
[00:47:45.960 --> 00:47:50.440]   For the bitterness talk, we have what?
[00:47:50.440 --> 00:47:52.760]   I think it's what page is it on?
[00:47:52.760 --> 00:47:57.200]   It's on page 22, right?
[00:47:57.200 --> 00:47:58.200]   Not too bad.
[00:47:58.200 --> 00:48:01.580]   So you've got a couple to work through there.
[00:48:01.580 --> 00:48:08.000]   You're going to read some scripture and you're just going to dialogue about forgiveness.
[00:48:08.000 --> 00:48:09.880]   And then there's a good scenario for you.
[00:48:09.880 --> 00:48:11.440]   The second question for bitterness.
[00:48:11.440 --> 00:48:14.720]   I think that'd be neat for you to really take time to really talk through that because that
[00:48:14.720 --> 00:48:19.240]   would be sort of a common thing that you would run into.
[00:48:19.240 --> 00:48:25.680]   And then on page 29 is the questions for anxiety.
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.360]   And you get to talk with each other about ways you're tempted to be anxious and how
[00:48:29.360 --> 00:48:34.320]   you can actually put what we just talked about, the Philippians 4 passage into practice.
[00:48:34.320 --> 00:48:37.160]   So I'm hoping that you're going to get that far.
