[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.360]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans Chapter 8, we're going to be reading from
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.840]   verse 31 to verse 35.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:20.880]   Romans Chapter 8, verse 31 through 35.
[00:00:20.880 --> 00:00:22.680]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.360]   What then shall we say to these things, if God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:00:26.360 --> 00:00:28.880]   He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for Saul.
[00:00:28.880 --> 00:00:32.200]   How will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.120]   Who shall bring any charge against God's elect?
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:36.120]   It is God who justifies.
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.120]   Who is to condemn?
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:39.000]   Christ Jesus, the one who died.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.800]   More than that, who was raised.
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:44.160]   Who is at the right hand of God, who indeed is interceding for us?
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:46.080]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:51.560]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:53.400]   Let's pray.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:01:00.040]   Father God, we want to thank you for our brother Tim and for sustaining him, watching over
[00:01:00.040 --> 00:01:04.840]   him and using him, Lord God, to support the ministry going on in China.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:10.800]   I pray that you would continue to help him, Lord God, to not to simply be a missionary
[00:01:10.800 --> 00:01:15.320]   who's done his work and come home, but to really be able to continue the work here,
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:18.640]   to reach out, to use his gifts to honor you.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:24.880]   We pray for our missionaries, Pastor Alex and Jen and the family, Lord, that in their
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:29.200]   travel here, I pray that you would watch over them and that the brief time that they will
[00:01:29.200 --> 00:01:33.840]   join us, I pray that you would refresh and strengthen them, that they may be re-equipped
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:37.160]   and refreshed, Lord God, for the sake of your work.
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:38.860]   We entrust this time to you.
[00:01:38.860 --> 00:01:43.560]   Help us to see your word as your word and not mine or anyone else's and that your word
[00:01:43.560 --> 00:01:45.480]   would have the impact, Lord, on all of us.
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:46.480]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:46.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   Amen.
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:52.400]   >> Now, we've been talking about our salvation and our security that we have in Christ and
[00:01:52.400 --> 00:02:01.760]   Paul, understandably, has been taking chapter 6, chapter 7, chapter 8, and if you were to
[00:02:01.760 --> 00:02:06.240]   take a step back, we can say that that's basically what he's been talking about from chapter
[00:02:06.240 --> 00:02:13.160]   1, by establishing our need for Christ, establishing that Christ came and died for us in our sins
[00:02:13.160 --> 00:02:17.220]   and then the security that we have and what happens as a result of our salvation.
[00:02:17.220 --> 00:02:20.520]   And so he's been pounding that over and over again.
[00:02:20.520 --> 00:02:26.520]   And it is absolutely essential, our security in Christ, that we're able to confess with
[00:02:26.520 --> 00:02:34.560]   absolute confidence that our salvation cannot be shaken, that it was not initiated by us
[00:02:34.560 --> 00:02:39.740]   and it is not something that God just kind of handed over to us, it's all dependent on
[00:02:39.740 --> 00:02:45.280]   you to see if you persevere, and it is not ultimately dependent on us and our glorification,
[00:02:45.280 --> 00:02:49.200]   that God initiated, he's the one who causes us to persevere and he's the one who causes
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:52.440]   the glorification ultimately to happen.
[00:02:52.440 --> 00:02:57.960]   There are things in our life that if we don't have security, if we don't have confidence,
[00:02:57.960 --> 00:02:59.600]   it's very difficult to function.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.760]   Something as simple as traffic lights.
[00:03:02.760 --> 00:03:06.680]   Every time you go through the intersection, if you don't have confidence that if it's
[00:03:06.680 --> 00:03:12.480]   green and you cross, that the other guy who's coming is not going to stop, you can't drive.
[00:03:12.480 --> 00:03:14.060]   You're not going to be able to drive.
[00:03:14.060 --> 00:03:16.720]   Every time you get to the intersection, you're going to have to make a stop and look left
[00:03:16.720 --> 00:03:17.720]   or right.
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:22.880]   There are certain people in your life that you depend on and you lean on, maybe even
[00:03:22.880 --> 00:03:24.640]   your job.
[00:03:24.640 --> 00:03:28.360]   You go in and there's some security in what you're doing.
[00:03:28.360 --> 00:03:32.960]   But no matter how much we depend on some of these things, as soon as your confidence is
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:39.360]   broken, even while you're driving, if 99% of the time you feel safe, but that one time
[00:03:39.360 --> 00:03:44.120]   that you cross the intersection and somebody didn't stop, if you've ever gotten in an accident
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:48.980]   where somebody who was supposed to stop, didn't stop, came through and hit you, and it was
[00:03:48.980 --> 00:03:53.500]   a pretty bad accident, from that moment on, you're going to think twice every time you
[00:03:53.500 --> 00:03:56.100]   go through that intersection.
[00:03:56.100 --> 00:04:01.060]   That confidence, that lack of confidence in that traffic light or what the other person
[00:04:01.060 --> 00:04:04.560]   is going to do is going to affect the way you drive your car.
[00:04:04.560 --> 00:04:06.340]   That's also true in relationships.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.620]   If you had a good friend that you completely relied on and later on somehow you found out
[00:04:10.620 --> 00:04:16.140]   they talked bad about you or gossiped about you and you've lost confidence.
[00:04:16.140 --> 00:04:19.260]   Now that doesn't have to happen over and over again.
[00:04:19.260 --> 00:04:24.920]   It can happen once or twice and it's enough for you to lose confidence in friendship.
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:29.020]   Sometimes that happens even in family relationships.
[00:04:29.020 --> 00:04:35.380]   All these things that are absolutely essential for us for survival, for normal living, the
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:40.060]   longer you live, you realize that nothing is absolutely secure.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:41.580]   Nothing.
[00:04:41.580 --> 00:04:45.740]   But there is this one thing in our salvation, in our relationship with God, that without
[00:04:45.740 --> 00:04:49.020]   this confidence you cannot function.
[00:04:49.020 --> 00:04:52.420]   There has to be absolute solid assurance.
[00:04:52.420 --> 00:04:56.520]   Or else, again, it unravels.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:04:59.480]   Everything that we know about our relationship with God, all the confidence that we have
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:06.520]   in eternal life, every perspective that we've had, every decision that we've made, it unravels
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:09.140]   if we lose confidence in our salvation.
[00:05:09.140 --> 00:05:15.700]   That is why it's absolutely essential that in our beginning walk with God, in our continuing
[00:05:15.700 --> 00:05:22.700]   persevering walk with God, in our final glorification that you and I understand as Paul has been
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:28.660]   pounding that our salvation is absolutely in his hands.
[00:05:28.660 --> 00:05:34.100]   One saved, always be saved if salvation is genuine.
[00:05:34.100 --> 00:05:38.400]   Whenever we talk about eternal security or election or predestination, there's always
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:40.940]   this thought, there's always this opposition.
[00:05:40.940 --> 00:05:46.340]   Well, if you preach predestination like the way you preach or what Paul seems like he's
[00:05:46.340 --> 00:05:51.660]   saying, isn't that going to lead to licentiousness?
[00:05:51.660 --> 00:05:55.660]   Aren't some people going to say, "Well, if one saved, always saved and our salvation
[00:05:55.660 --> 00:05:59.060]   is absolutely secure, it doesn't matter how we live."
[00:05:59.060 --> 00:06:02.020]   So all this preaching about, "Let's do this, let's do that, I mean, there's nothing wrong
[00:06:02.020 --> 00:06:06.580]   with that, but whether I do it or don't do it, it doesn't matter."
[00:06:06.580 --> 00:06:11.940]   Wouldn't some people respond in a way where they don't think obedience, "I should do it,
[00:06:11.940 --> 00:06:14.020]   but it's not essential."
[00:06:14.020 --> 00:06:18.660]   Living holy is important, but not essential.
[00:06:18.660 --> 00:06:21.660]   Truth of the matter is, a lot of the people do respond that way.
[00:06:21.660 --> 00:06:27.020]   A lot of people, when we talk about predestination, will respond in a way where it's kind of like
[00:06:27.020 --> 00:06:30.860]   a security blanket, "Well, I'm not following Christ.
[00:06:30.860 --> 00:06:35.860]   I say He's my Lord, but I don't live like it, but again, thank God I'm saved and all
[00:06:35.860 --> 00:06:36.860]   of that doesn't matter."
[00:06:36.860 --> 00:06:42.980]   Well, let me tell you plainly, that is not a Christian response.
[00:06:42.980 --> 00:06:44.100]   That is not a Christian response.
[00:06:44.100 --> 00:06:49.780]   Somebody who does not have faith may superficially hold on to the doctrine of our security in
[00:06:49.780 --> 00:06:56.700]   Christ and will say, "Well, I believe that, and so I should, but I don't, but it doesn't
[00:06:56.700 --> 00:06:58.700]   matter."
[00:06:58.700 --> 00:07:04.500]   Somebody who does not have faith may confess to believe that, but by their life, they demonstrate
[00:07:04.500 --> 00:07:06.100]   what they truly believe.
[00:07:06.100 --> 00:07:09.620]   "Let us eat, be merry, for tomorrow we die.
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:11.420]   This is all we have.
[00:07:11.420 --> 00:07:12.820]   YOLO."
[00:07:12.820 --> 00:07:14.060]   Right?
[00:07:14.060 --> 00:07:16.140]   You only live once.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:17.140]   Right?
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:21.780]   So, the real application of what they really believe is YOLO.
[00:07:21.780 --> 00:07:22.940]   Right?
[00:07:22.940 --> 00:07:23.940]   We only live once.
[00:07:23.940 --> 00:07:25.340]   This is all we have, so let's live and die.
[00:07:25.340 --> 00:07:30.460]   And then, Jesus and the gospel that we profess to believe in is nothing more than an extra
[00:07:30.460 --> 00:07:32.740]   security blanket, just in case.
[00:07:32.740 --> 00:07:39.420]   See, the doctrine of election doesn't cause genuine believers to be passive at all.
[00:07:39.420 --> 00:07:43.380]   If anything, it gives us confidence to live righteously.
[00:07:43.380 --> 00:07:48.660]   It gives us security to be able to pursue holiness without constant fear of anxiety
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:56.300]   that I haven't done enough, that I'm not trying to earn an A. All I'm trying to do is be faithful.
[00:07:56.300 --> 00:08:01.820]   See, this doctrine of election is the foundation upon which we build everything else that we
[00:08:01.820 --> 00:08:02.820]   do.
[00:08:02.820 --> 00:08:06.660]   It is not a security blanket so that I can live any way I want.
[00:08:06.660 --> 00:08:12.540]   Again, like I said, it will, whenever the Word of God is preached, it always reveals
[00:08:12.540 --> 00:08:17.340]   the genuineness of someone's faith and how they respond to the Word that they hear will
[00:08:17.340 --> 00:08:20.420]   reveal what they genuinely believe.
[00:08:20.420 --> 00:08:25.060]   Paul has been expositing some chapter 6, chapter 7, and chapter 8, the absolute security that
[00:08:25.060 --> 00:08:26.060]   we have in Christ.
[00:08:26.060 --> 00:08:28.100]   So, chapter 8 is kind of like a crescendo.
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:34.740]   It's at the end of this important message of absolute security that we have in Christ.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:40.060]   And so, the way he's going to end it is by giving seven rhetorical questions.
[00:08:40.060 --> 00:08:44.940]   Now, whenever we give a rhetorical question, it's not, we don't give it because we don't
[00:08:44.940 --> 00:08:45.940]   know the answer.
[00:08:45.940 --> 00:08:49.220]   It's called rhetorical because it's obvious.
[00:08:49.220 --> 00:08:52.660]   If I asked you, "Well, what comes after Monday?"
[00:08:52.660 --> 00:08:55.440]   It's not because I don't know that it's Tuesday.
[00:08:55.440 --> 00:08:58.380]   It's not because I don't think you know that it's Tuesday.
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:08:59.540]   It's because I'm trying to make a statement.
[00:08:59.540 --> 00:09:02.740]   "Well, what comes after Monday?"
[00:09:02.740 --> 00:09:03.740]   Of course it's Tuesday.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:04.980]   Now, why am I asking you that?
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:08.100]   Because there's something important on Tuesday.
[00:09:08.100 --> 00:09:09.100]   It's our anniversary.
[00:09:09.100 --> 00:09:10.100]   It's my birthday.
[00:09:10.100 --> 00:09:11.100]   Right?
[00:09:11.100 --> 00:09:15.100]   Something important is happening, and I'm trying to convey that through a rhetorical
[00:09:15.100 --> 00:09:16.100]   question.
[00:09:16.100 --> 00:09:17.420]   That's how we use rhetorical questions.
[00:09:17.420 --> 00:09:18.420]   Right?
[00:09:18.420 --> 00:09:25.940]   Paul gives seven rhetorical questions in conclusion, kind of a crescendo of obvious answers that
[00:09:25.940 --> 00:09:28.220]   he's already given in the previous chapters.
[00:09:28.220 --> 00:09:29.220]   Right?
[00:09:29.220 --> 00:09:32.940]   He begins by asking, "What then shall we say to these things?"
[00:09:32.940 --> 00:09:35.740]   Well, what is it these things that he's talking about?
[00:09:35.740 --> 00:09:36.740]   Right?
[00:09:36.740 --> 00:09:40.220]   The union with Christ in his death and resurrection.
[00:09:40.220 --> 00:09:46.220]   The Holy Spirit that's given to us as a seal to empower us to live godly lives.
[00:09:46.220 --> 00:09:48.380]   He said that all things work together for good.
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:49.740]   The good and the bad.
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:51.820]   In season and out of season.
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:59.640]   That whether it is our foreknowledge, predestination, justification, that all of these things, ultimately
[00:09:59.640 --> 00:10:03.100]   God is working for our salvation.
[00:10:03.100 --> 00:10:06.500]   So when he asks this question, "What then shall we say to these things?"
[00:10:06.500 --> 00:10:09.300]   He's already answered these questions in the previous chapters.
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:12.060]   So he's trying to reemphasize.
[00:10:12.060 --> 00:10:18.500]   Just in case, let's summarize what we've said up to this point.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:19.500]   What then shall we say?
[00:10:19.500 --> 00:10:22.980]   So he has seven questions, including the one I just read.
[00:10:22.980 --> 00:10:26.820]   But in the seven questions, I think can be summarized in four.
[00:10:26.820 --> 00:10:31.300]   So I'm going to condense it to four, and we're going to go over that this morning.
[00:10:31.300 --> 00:10:32.300]   What then shall we say?
[00:10:32.300 --> 00:10:38.260]   First thing he says, "If God is for us, who can be against us?"
[00:10:38.260 --> 00:10:42.660]   That's the first, again, confirmation that he gives.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:49.500]   If you had any doubt that because of opposition, because of failures, because of doubts or
[00:10:49.500 --> 00:10:56.580]   whatever it is happening in your life, if God is for you, who can possibly be against
[00:10:56.580 --> 00:10:58.820]   you?
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:02.820]   The first thing that I think about when I think about the confidence that we have, that
[00:11:02.820 --> 00:11:08.460]   we ought to have in Christ, a lot of times, whether it is doubt or anxiety, it all comes
[00:11:08.460 --> 00:11:14.600]   because we're not able to see the reality that is in Christ.
[00:11:14.600 --> 00:11:20.980]   If you remember the story in 2 Kings 6, it was during a period of Israel's history where
[00:11:20.980 --> 00:11:24.220]   they were kind of shaky in their relationship with God.
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:28.980]   And the Syrians were constantly coming in to try to conquer Israel.
[00:11:28.980 --> 00:11:34.700]   Well, Elisha the prophet had a very intimate relationship with God, and God would constantly
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:38.020]   reveal to him that Syrians are going to come, and they're going to attack you in this valley,
[00:11:38.020 --> 00:11:40.380]   so don't go to that valley.
[00:11:40.380 --> 00:11:45.380]   And the Syrians aren't able to conquer them, so they make another plan.
[00:11:45.380 --> 00:11:48.660]   And then Elisha tells the king of Israel, "Don't go there either, because God told me
[00:11:48.660 --> 00:11:51.660]   if you go there, they're going to attack you from every side."
[00:11:51.660 --> 00:11:56.200]   So every time the Syrians make a plan to attack them, Elisha tells them what's happening.
[00:11:56.200 --> 00:11:59.060]   So the king of Syria says, "What's going on?
[00:11:59.060 --> 00:12:01.700]   Do we have a spy among us?"
[00:12:01.700 --> 00:12:04.020]   And one of his servants says, "No, there's not a spy within us.
[00:12:04.020 --> 00:12:08.820]   There's a man named Elisha who is constantly prophesying about what's happening."
[00:12:08.820 --> 00:12:09.820]   He said, "Well, go capture this man."
[00:12:09.820 --> 00:12:15.180]   And that's the setup for 2 Kings 6, 15, and 17.
[00:12:15.180 --> 00:12:20.660]   The Syrian army has surrounded Elisha and his servant, basically captured them and probably
[00:12:20.660 --> 00:12:21.660]   killed them.
[00:12:21.660 --> 00:12:24.940]   This is what it says, 2 Kings 6, 15-17.
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:29.180]   "When the servant of the man of God rose early in the morning and went out, behold,
[00:12:29.180 --> 00:12:32.780]   an army with horses and chariots was all around the city.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.300]   And the servant said, 'Alas, my master, what shall we do?'
[00:12:37.300 --> 00:12:42.460]   He said, 'Do not be afraid, for those who are with us are more than those who are with
[00:12:42.460 --> 00:12:43.460]   them.'"
[00:12:43.460 --> 00:12:47.540]   Now, physically speaking, Elisha, you're crazy.
[00:12:47.540 --> 00:12:49.540]   It's just me and you, right?
[00:12:49.540 --> 00:12:53.660]   And again, the servant doesn't know what Elisha knows.
[00:12:53.660 --> 00:12:57.860]   The servant doesn't see because he sees with his physical eyes.
[00:12:57.860 --> 00:13:02.180]   So he prays, Elisha prays to God and says, "Oh Lord, please open his eyes that he may
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:03.180]   see."
[00:13:03.180 --> 00:13:07.220]   So the Lord opened the eyes of the young man and he saw, and behold, the mountain was full
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:10.900]   of horses and chariots of fire all around Elisha.
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:16.220]   Kind of reminds me of the scene when Jesus was in the boat when the storm came and all
[00:13:16.220 --> 00:13:20.180]   these professional fishermen, they're freaking out, right?
[00:13:20.180 --> 00:13:25.180]   And these guys fish for a living, so they're probably used to storms and rocky waters and
[00:13:25.180 --> 00:13:28.380]   it was bad enough or they're freaking out, saying, thinking they think they're going
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:29.380]   to die.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:33.060]   And Jesus wakes up and says, "You have little faith," right?
[00:13:33.060 --> 00:13:35.540]   Because they don't know what he knows.
[00:13:35.540 --> 00:13:39.380]   And the reason why they were in fear is because they didn't really know who was on the boat
[00:13:39.380 --> 00:13:41.220]   with them.
[00:13:41.220 --> 00:13:43.220]   They knew, but they didn't really know.
[00:13:43.940 --> 00:13:51.540]   See this scene with Elisha and the servant, Elisha is calm because Elisha knows that God
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:52.620]   is with him.
[00:13:52.620 --> 00:13:54.860]   And that's exactly what Paul is saying.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:14:00.220]   Again, Paul says in Galatians 6.17, "From now on, let no one cause trouble for me, for
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:02.180]   I bear on my body the marks of Jesus."
[00:14:02.180 --> 00:14:05.860]   Paul is not saying, "Don't mess with me because I got a bigger sword."
[00:14:05.860 --> 00:14:06.860]   Right?
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:08.420]   He's saying, "You know what?
[00:14:08.420 --> 00:14:12.900]   I planted all these churches and if you mess with me, I'm going to be able to call all
[00:14:12.900 --> 00:14:16.380]   of them and you're not going to be able to overpower me.
[00:14:16.380 --> 00:14:19.500]   Let no one mess with me."
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:24.700]   Galatians is written in the context of him being beaten, imprisoned, shipwrecked, going
[00:14:24.700 --> 00:14:27.340]   hungry, persecuted.
[00:14:27.340 --> 00:14:31.420]   Even as he is sitting in prison in Philippi, somebody in the church is preaching the gospel
[00:14:31.420 --> 00:14:35.640]   to make it harder for him, to put more pressure on him.
[00:14:35.640 --> 00:14:39.340]   He had oppositions from outside and inside.
[00:14:39.340 --> 00:14:43.500]   And he explains that in the midst of all of this, even, he's a human being.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.640]   He struggles with his flesh.
[00:14:45.640 --> 00:14:50.460]   He struggles with anxiety, he says in Corinthians, over the churches that he's planted.
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.380]   So what does he mean in Galatians 6.17?
[00:14:53.380 --> 00:14:56.020]   I think you and I know exactly what he's talking about.
[00:14:56.020 --> 00:15:02.820]   "Now on, let no one cause trouble for me, for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus."
[00:15:02.820 --> 00:15:05.380]   He's not talking about the whipping that he got.
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:06.700]   He's not talking about him being stoned.
[00:15:06.700 --> 00:15:07.700]   He's saying, "Look right here.
[00:15:07.700 --> 00:15:08.700]   You know, I got stoned right here.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:10.980]   That's marks of Jesus."
[00:15:10.980 --> 00:15:17.340]   What Paul was saying was that he was tagged.
[00:15:17.340 --> 00:15:20.740]   He was tagged by the blood of Christ.
[00:15:20.740 --> 00:15:27.980]   That the seal of the Holy Spirit, guaranteeing his salvation, is on Peter, spiritually.
[00:15:27.980 --> 00:15:34.660]   So whether you beat me, persecute me, or ultimately even kill me, God is on my side.
[00:15:34.660 --> 00:15:36.660]   I've been tagged by the blood of Jesus.
[00:15:36.660 --> 00:15:40.400]   That's what he means, "Let no one cause trouble for me."
[00:15:40.400 --> 00:15:45.480]   And that's the first thing that Paul says in our salvation.
[00:15:45.480 --> 00:15:52.520]   The first thing about justification, the doctrine of justification, tells us God is for us.
[00:15:52.520 --> 00:15:55.040]   God is on our side.
[00:15:55.040 --> 00:15:56.420]   It's not God and us.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:57.880]   It's not God and the church.
[00:15:57.880 --> 00:15:59.380]   It's God.
[00:15:59.380 --> 00:16:00.380]   God is for us.
[00:16:00.380 --> 00:16:03.300]   Who can possibly be against us?
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:09.300]   Well, I mean, I think our opposition as Christians can be probably divided into three parts.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:13.300]   The world, the devil, and our own flesh.
[00:16:13.300 --> 00:16:17.900]   The world, the devil, and our own flesh is constantly opposing us.
[00:16:17.900 --> 00:16:21.980]   Jesus said in John 16, 1-4, "I have said all these things to you to keep you from falling
[00:16:21.980 --> 00:16:23.480]   away.
[00:16:23.480 --> 00:16:25.300]   They will put you out of the synagogues.
[00:16:25.300 --> 00:16:30.620]   Indeed, the hour is coming when whoever kills you will think he is offering service to God.
[00:16:30.620 --> 00:16:34.140]   And they will do these things because they have not known the Father nor me.
[00:16:34.140 --> 00:16:38.460]   But I have said these things to you that when their hour comes you may remember that I told
[00:16:38.460 --> 00:16:41.060]   them to you."
[00:16:41.060 --> 00:16:46.380]   You know, it's a strange thing that we are experiencing in our generation of Christianity
[00:16:46.380 --> 00:16:51.820]   that we're trying so hard to be cool in the eyes of the world so that the coolest people
[00:16:51.820 --> 00:16:55.700]   in the world, you know, will think that we're cool.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:57.380]   And that this is not going to be a strange place.
[00:16:57.380 --> 00:17:01.540]   So when all the cool people in the world step into the church that they'll fit right in.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:09.220]   It is a strange thing that the church has embraced knowing full well that Jesus said
[00:17:09.220 --> 00:17:12.780]   they're not going to accept you.
[00:17:12.780 --> 00:17:14.980]   You're going to be aliens and strangers in this world.
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:22.260]   In fact, if you look at every gospel, every epistle in the New Testament, there is a warning.
[00:17:22.260 --> 00:17:29.180]   There is a warning that persecution is going to come if you stand up and declare the gospel.
[00:17:29.180 --> 00:17:33.540]   If you're a follower of Jesus Christ, you are light in darkness and the darkness doesn't
[00:17:33.540 --> 00:17:34.540]   like it.
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:36.700]   It doesn't matter how you dress.
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:39.180]   It doesn't matter how we play the music.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.380]   It doesn't matter how cool and nice we try to make it into the church.
[00:17:42.380 --> 00:17:44.860]   The scripture says, and why does he say it?
[00:17:44.860 --> 00:17:46.260]   He says so that you may not fall away.
[00:17:46.260 --> 00:17:50.020]   It may not surprise you, he says.
[00:17:50.020 --> 00:17:52.660]   That when they start to hate you and think you're weird because of the things that you
[00:17:52.660 --> 00:17:57.900]   profess to believe, that you don't become surprised and as a result of that fall away
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:17:58.900]   from your faith.
[00:17:58.900 --> 00:18:02.780]   So he warns us and he tells us, brace yourself for that.
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:07.540]   We have opposition clearly in the world, but it goes even further than that.
[00:18:07.540 --> 00:18:10.660]   We have opposition of the devil himself.
[00:18:10.660 --> 00:18:13.180]   First Peter 5, 8, be sober minded, be watchful.
[00:18:13.180 --> 00:18:18.980]   Your adversary, the devil prowls around like a rowing lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:23.300]   We can make a mistake of thinking of the devil in two extremes.
[00:18:23.300 --> 00:18:28.540]   You have one extreme where Hollywood makes him the superpower.
[00:18:28.540 --> 00:18:31.820]   You open up the Bible and the devil tears it up.
[00:18:31.820 --> 00:18:33.540]   Everybody's trembling in fear.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.580]   There's nothing can overpower the devil except for this cross.
[00:18:36.580 --> 00:18:38.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:18:38.020 --> 00:18:45.940]   Or you go in and you make this devil the supernatural power being that no one can do anything about.
[00:18:45.940 --> 00:18:48.180]   So that's created by Hollywood.
[00:18:48.180 --> 00:18:52.060]   And then you have the other extreme where you're kind of like, ah, the devil is nothing.
[00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:56.260]   And you kind of minimize him to the point where you don't even think he really exists
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.140]   other than every once in a while it's mentioned in the Bible.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:05.180]   Well the biblical view of the devil is powerful.
[00:19:05.180 --> 00:19:09.780]   Out of all the created beings, there's nothing more powerful than Satan himself.
[00:19:09.780 --> 00:19:12.260]   All the created things.
[00:19:12.260 --> 00:19:16.140]   And he was so powerful and influential, he was able to take a third of the angels with
[00:19:16.140 --> 00:19:21.260]   him and third of the angels created in heaven fell away with him and is in rebellion against
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:22.260]   God.
[00:19:22.260 --> 00:19:29.860]   So you imagine what that means when the scripture says you have an adversary, the devil, like
[00:19:29.860 --> 00:19:32.620]   a roaring lion seeking someone to devour.
[00:19:32.620 --> 00:19:33.620]   Who's that someone?
[00:19:33.620 --> 00:19:36.060]   That's not a random someone.
[00:19:36.060 --> 00:19:40.040]   The devil is not looking to devour his own.
[00:19:40.040 --> 00:19:43.580]   People that he's already under his dominion.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:49.300]   That someone he's talking about are people who claim to be children of God.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:54.020]   And that's why we are warned again and again, Ephesians 6, 12, for we do not wrestle against
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:19:58.340]   flesh and blood, but against the rulers, against authorities, against the cosmic powers over
[00:19:58.340 --> 00:20:04.660]   the present darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenly places.
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:11.540]   I mean, if you claim to be a Christian, if this is all true and we believe all this to
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:19.500]   be true, how can we possibly not fall into despair if it wasn't for Christ?
[00:20:19.500 --> 00:20:28.620]   Knowing that this superpower being is actively pursuing to go against you, to knock you down.
[00:20:28.620 --> 00:20:33.060]   How can we possibly not being connected with Christ have any confidence?
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:36.440]   We will be overwhelmed with anxiety.
[00:20:36.440 --> 00:20:42.240]   The whole world around us doesn't want the light.
[00:20:42.240 --> 00:20:48.980]   And then on top of that, the God of this age is actively working with all his intellect,
[00:20:48.980 --> 00:20:49.980]   with all his power.
[00:20:49.980 --> 00:20:52.880]   And see, the devil doesn't need to be invited.
[00:20:52.880 --> 00:20:55.340]   That's why the Bible says, "Do not give him a foothold."
[00:20:55.340 --> 00:20:58.820]   See, the devil is on the constantly attacking.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:21:04.420]   So if you give him a crack and you give him any way to get in, he'll get in.
[00:21:04.420 --> 00:21:07.820]   Generally speaking, how can we not be in despair?
[00:21:07.820 --> 00:21:09.980]   How can we not be anxious?
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:12.080]   But that's not where it ends.
[00:21:12.080 --> 00:21:14.580]   Our own flesh fights against us.
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.560]   Galatians 5, 17, "For the desires of the flesh are against the spirit, and the desires
[00:21:18.560 --> 00:21:20.460]   of the spirit are against the flesh.
[00:21:20.460 --> 00:21:24.380]   For these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things that you want to
[00:21:24.380 --> 00:21:26.000]   do."
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.020]   We have the Holy Spirit that's made an indwelling in us, but we are not home yet.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.760]   We're still living in the flesh.
[00:21:31.760 --> 00:21:38.200]   As long as we are in this tent, our flesh is going to be fighting us.
[00:21:38.200 --> 00:21:42.800]   Galatians 6, 8, "For the one who sows to his own flesh will from the flesh reap corruption,
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.440]   but the one who sows to the spirit will from the spirit reap eternal life."
[00:21:46.440 --> 00:21:54.200]   How can we possibly think that we're going to be victorious with that kind of opposition?
[00:21:54.200 --> 00:22:00.200]   So the key to what Paul is saying is not, "You are great.
[00:22:00.200 --> 00:22:01.200]   Work harder.
[00:22:01.200 --> 00:22:02.200]   Be strong."
[00:22:02.200 --> 00:22:10.240]   No, the key to what he is saying is, if God is for us, if God is for us, the world, the
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:14.280]   devil, even your own flesh cannot stand.
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:21.800]   Our security isn't because God looked at us and he found some diamond in the rough.
[00:22:21.800 --> 00:22:24.840]   He saw some people with potential who were able to do great things for God.
[00:22:24.840 --> 00:22:26.760]   That's not what it says.
[00:22:26.760 --> 00:22:31.760]   The Bible actually reminds us that he loved us and saved us while we were yet sinners.
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:37.660]   We weren't diamond in the rough that he tripped over and said, "Oh, I forgot this one."
[00:22:37.660 --> 00:22:38.660]   God is for us.
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:39.660]   Who can be against it?
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:41.000]   Where's the proof that God is for us?
[00:22:41.000 --> 00:22:46.200]   In the next verse he says, "He who did not spare his own son, but gave him up for us
[00:22:46.200 --> 00:22:49.080]   all, how will he not graciously give us all things?"
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:53.440]   Okay, it's a rhetorical question.
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:23:00.800]   If he gave his son, his most precious being, why do you question that God has power or
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:04.800]   the will to sustain you?
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:09.160]   Years ago, when I was a youth pastor dealing with teenagers, every once in a while I would
[00:23:09.160 --> 00:23:16.240]   have to counsel some teenager who would come and tell me some off the wall stuff and would
[00:23:16.240 --> 00:23:21.080]   come and tell me, "My mom, she won't feed me dinner.
[00:23:21.080 --> 00:23:23.120]   I'm so angry with her.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:24.120]   She won't make me dinner.
[00:23:24.120 --> 00:23:26.160]   She doesn't want me to eat."
[00:23:26.160 --> 00:23:30.960]   So I'm like, "That same mom who just dropped you off, she's not making you dinner."
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.560]   I say, "Yeah."
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:37.640]   "That same mom who picked you up when you got in trouble at school."
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:38.640]   "That mom."
[00:23:38.640 --> 00:23:39.640]   I say, "Yeah."
[00:23:39.640 --> 00:23:43.600]   "The one that took you to the hospital because you were sick and got you medicine and took
[00:23:43.600 --> 00:23:47.480]   time off of work so that she can be by your bedside all day long.
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:48.480]   That mom."
[00:23:48.480 --> 00:23:49.480]   "Yeah."
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:56.640]   "That same lady for 16 years have been wiping your butt, feeding your food every single
[00:23:56.640 --> 00:23:57.640]   day.
[00:23:57.640 --> 00:23:58.640]   That mom.
[00:23:58.640 --> 00:24:00.680]   That mom won't feed you food.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   That's what you're saying right now."
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:02.680]   "Yeah."
[00:24:02.680 --> 00:24:03.680]   "Do you hear yourself?
[00:24:03.680 --> 00:24:04.680]   You're saying that mom doesn't want you to eat."
[00:24:04.680 --> 00:24:13.800]   And then you dig a little bit further and you realize that that kid was eating junk
[00:24:13.800 --> 00:24:17.280]   food all day long and the mom says, "You can't keep eating like that.
[00:24:17.280 --> 00:24:20.440]   If you eat like that, you can't have dinner."
[00:24:20.440 --> 00:24:21.440]   Right?
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.840]   And all he knows is angry because he doesn't get to do what he wants to do.
[00:24:24.840 --> 00:24:27.600]   My mom won't feed me dinner.
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:31.480]   Now no one would believe that because that mom won't feed you dinner.
[00:24:31.480 --> 00:24:32.480]   Right?
[00:24:32.480 --> 00:24:39.320]   As ridiculous as that statement may be, what Paul is saying is, "How can you not have confidence
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:40.320]   in God?
[00:24:40.320 --> 00:24:45.320]   You come in here singing about His Son dying for you and then you're living every day thinking
[00:24:45.320 --> 00:24:50.160]   like, 'Oh, He doesn't care, doesn't give me a job, I don't have food, I don't have this.'"
[00:24:50.160 --> 00:24:54.960]   And your source of anxiety, how will He not?
[00:24:54.960 --> 00:25:02.760]   If He gave you His Son to justify you, how will He not along with Him give you everything?
[00:25:02.760 --> 00:25:06.760]   Somebody gives you a million dollars and then you say, "You know what?
[00:25:06.760 --> 00:25:08.440]   I need $10 for breakfast."
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:11.520]   He's like, "I don't know.
[00:25:11.520 --> 00:25:12.520]   I don't know.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.760]   I don't want to ask Him because I don't know if He's going to give it to me."
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:19.320]   He gave you a million dollars.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:25.400]   See the illogical, the way we feel sometimes, the anxiousness and the despair that we fall
[00:25:25.400 --> 00:25:33.080]   into sometimes is inconsistent with our faith.
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:36.800]   Psalm 84, 11, 12, "For the Lord God is a Son and a shield.
[00:25:36.800 --> 00:25:38.680]   The Lord bestows favor and honor.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   No good thing does He withhold."
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:47.240]   No good thing does He withhold from those who walk uprightly, O Lord of hosts, blessed
[00:25:47.240 --> 00:25:52.020]   is the one who trusts in You.
[00:25:52.020 --> 00:25:56.400]   No good thing does He withhold.
[00:25:56.400 --> 00:26:04.320]   In Matthew 9, 5, when Jesus heals the paralytic, they come to Him, drops a paralytic and say,
[00:26:04.320 --> 00:26:05.320]   "I want you to heal him."
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:06.600]   Jesus said, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:26:06.600 --> 00:26:09.520]   Everybody freaks out, "Who are you?"
[00:26:09.520 --> 00:26:13.920]   Only God can forgive sins and Jesus responds to them and says, "What's easier?
[00:26:13.920 --> 00:26:14.920]   What is harder to say?
[00:26:14.920 --> 00:26:18.680]   To say your sins are forgiven or to tell them to get up and walk?"
[00:26:18.680 --> 00:26:24.120]   Now for me and you, it's much harder to say, "Get up and walk," because I can't do that,
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:25.120]   right?
[00:26:25.120 --> 00:26:26.120]   Anybody have stubbed toe?
[00:26:26.120 --> 00:26:27.120]   I got nothing for you.
[00:26:27.120 --> 00:26:28.600]   All right, go to the hospital.
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:33.100]   I'll pray for you, but I don't have healing power, right?
[00:26:33.100 --> 00:26:34.440]   I could say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:26:34.440 --> 00:26:35.440]   I just said it.
[00:26:35.440 --> 00:26:36.440]   I've said it many times.
[00:26:36.440 --> 00:26:38.320]   It's so easy, right?
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.760]   But think about who's saying it.
[00:26:41.760 --> 00:26:46.960]   The God of the universe who created all things, who simply gets up and says, "Storm, stop,"
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:49.000]   and it stops.
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.880]   Blind man, open your eyes.
[00:26:51.880 --> 00:26:52.880]   It opens.
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.960]   You know, lepers, you say, "Go show yourself to the priest."
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   Even on their way, they get healed.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:27:02.840]   A woman who's hemorrhaging, all she does is reach out to him in faith and just by being
[00:27:02.840 --> 00:27:06.000]   near him, she gets healed.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:10.040]   So for him to say, "Get up and walk," there's no sweat off of his back.
[00:27:10.040 --> 00:27:13.360]   Get up and get out, right?
[00:27:13.360 --> 00:27:14.360]   Which is harder.
[00:27:14.360 --> 00:27:17.300]   So your sins are forgiven.
[00:27:17.300 --> 00:27:21.400]   In order for him to say, "Your sins are forgiven," and for that to actually have any kind of
[00:27:21.400 --> 00:27:28.000]   power, that same God who created the universe, that same God who can heal simply by someone's
[00:27:28.000 --> 00:27:32.360]   touch and being near him, Emdid himself became nothing.
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:33.360]   He humbled himself.
[00:27:33.360 --> 00:27:36.960]   He walked in sinful man's shoes.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:41.040]   He experienced all the pain that you and I would experience in life because of living
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.080]   in the fallen world.
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.640]   Performing all these miracles, loving and serving these very people that at the end
[00:27:47.640 --> 00:27:50.680]   of the ministry were going to reject him and crucify him.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.000]   Imagine the loneliness.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:55.540]   Imagine the humiliation.
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:27:59.600]   And then even as he's about to go to the cross, his closest companion denied him and they're
[00:27:59.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   disappearing.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:05.400]   If that wasn't enough, as he's hanging on the cross, he cries out to his father for
[00:28:05.400 --> 00:28:13.560]   the first time in his existence, "Father, Father, my God, my God, why have you forsaken
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.240]   me?"
[00:28:17.240 --> 00:28:21.700]   He did all of that to justify us.
[00:28:21.700 --> 00:28:22.700]   He did all of that.
[00:28:22.700 --> 00:28:23.700]   He went through all of that pain.
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:30.000]   He sacrificed all of that just to say, "Your sins are forgiven."
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:34.680]   So he who did not spare his own son, how will he not along with that give us all these other
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.240]   things?
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:41.280]   You think he went through all that trouble to justify us and then left sanctification?
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:42.280]   That's on you.
[00:28:42.280 --> 00:28:44.840]   Hope you make it.
[00:28:44.840 --> 00:28:54.240]   He said, "No, our security is firmly in his hands because he who began a good work in
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:58.400]   you, he will carry it onto completion on the day of Christ."
[00:28:58.400 --> 00:29:00.120]   That's why we have security.
[00:29:00.120 --> 00:29:04.840]   Again, a non-Christian may hear this and say, "Wow, that's great.
[00:29:04.840 --> 00:29:06.760]   Then I have this free ticket to heaven.
[00:29:06.760 --> 00:29:07.760]   I got it.
[00:29:07.760 --> 00:29:08.760]   Now I can do whatever I want."
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:09.760]   Right?
[00:29:09.760 --> 00:29:15.160]   Someone who is unbelieving may simply see the doctrine of security as a ticket to do
[00:29:15.160 --> 00:29:21.520]   whatever they want because they don't really believe that Jesus is life.
[00:29:21.520 --> 00:29:27.800]   But if you're a genuine believer and you believe that Christ is life, that's where I find life.
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:33.760]   Then, the doctrine of security gives us strength to persevere.
[00:29:33.760 --> 00:29:35.120]   It gives us strength to go.
[00:29:35.120 --> 00:29:39.800]   Even when we fail, it gives us strength to get back up and continue.
[00:29:39.800 --> 00:29:48.600]   Why Peter and Judas, the sorrow that led to condemnation, all he saw was, "I did wrong
[00:29:48.600 --> 00:29:51.040]   and I deserve to die and he dies."
[00:29:51.040 --> 00:29:52.440]   Where Peter repents and he's restored.
[00:29:52.440 --> 00:29:55.560]   What was the difference?
[00:29:55.560 --> 00:30:00.800]   The sorrow that leads to repentance and sorrow that leads to condemnation.
[00:30:00.800 --> 00:30:04.800]   This doctrine of security gives us absolute security in Christ.
[00:30:04.800 --> 00:30:09.200]   And then he says, the next verse, "Who shall bring any charge against God, God's elect?
[00:30:09.200 --> 00:30:11.760]   It is God who justifies.
[00:30:11.760 --> 00:30:14.680]   Who is it that condemns?"
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:18.720]   It's almost like the challenge to the world.
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:21.520]   This is my son.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:23.720]   These are my adopted children.
[00:30:23.720 --> 00:30:25.840]   You are under my wings and my care.
[00:30:25.840 --> 00:30:29.320]   Who is going to come and accuse?
[00:30:29.320 --> 00:30:36.720]   You'd have to be one arrogant being to say, "I'll do it."
[00:30:36.720 --> 00:30:41.760]   Well, scripture tells us there is a being, Satan.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:46.040]   In Revelation chapter 12, 10, it says, "And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, 'Now
[00:30:46.040 --> 00:30:49.920]   the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of his Christ
[00:30:49.920 --> 00:30:54.800]   have come, for the accuser of our brothers has been thrown down.'"
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.280]   He's talking about Satan.
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.560]   "Who accuses them day and night before God."
[00:30:59.560 --> 00:31:02.560]   There are a couple of things I want to highlight about Satan here.
[00:31:02.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   One, he's called the accuser.
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:09.400]   Now if you want to, in modern terms, he's a prosecutor, constantly pointing out.
[00:31:09.400 --> 00:31:13.400]   If you're guilty, he's going to point it out.
[00:31:13.400 --> 00:31:20.800]   The audacity to stand before the throne of God, to accuse those that God claims is his.
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.800]   Only Satan would have that audacity.
[00:31:22.800 --> 00:31:24.680]   That's exactly how it's described.
[00:31:24.680 --> 00:31:25.720]   But look at the second thing.
[00:31:25.720 --> 00:31:29.240]   Not only is he the accuser, who does he accuse?
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.240]   He's the accuser of who?
[00:31:31.240 --> 00:31:33.720]   Of our brothers.
[00:31:33.720 --> 00:31:36.680]   He's accusing Christians.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:39.600]   Constantly questioning.
[00:31:39.600 --> 00:31:42.480]   Constantly questioning.
[00:31:42.480 --> 00:31:44.720]   How can he be your child?
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:46.960]   How can God love you?
[00:31:46.960 --> 00:31:49.120]   How can you be justified?
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:50.920]   And he's constantly accusing the brothers.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:51.920]   When is he doing it?
[00:31:51.920 --> 00:31:56.880]   He accuses them day and night before our God.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.520]   He doesn't, he's not part time.
[00:31:58.520 --> 00:32:00.600]   He doesn't do it on Monday and then he forgets on Tuesday.
[00:32:00.600 --> 00:32:05.320]   He says constantly, the accuser is accusing the brothers day and night.
[00:32:05.320 --> 00:32:10.800]   And that is why in Romans 8.34 it says, "Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:32:10.800 --> 00:32:11.800]   More than that, who was raised.
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:13.160]   Who is at the right hand of God.
[00:32:13.160 --> 00:32:15.880]   Who indeed is interceding for us."
[00:32:15.880 --> 00:32:17.880]   You notice he doesn't say, "He interceded."
[00:32:17.880 --> 00:32:21.520]   He doesn't just say, "He justified and then the end.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:23.840]   And now he's watching to see who's going to make it."
[00:32:23.840 --> 00:32:25.040]   He says, "No, he's interceding."
[00:32:25.040 --> 00:32:28.520]   Right?
[00:32:28.520 --> 00:32:31.360]   He's interceding.
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.960]   So he started it.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.200]   And he's continuing it.
[00:32:35.200 --> 00:32:36.800]   And he's going to finish it.
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.160]   The accuser is constantly accusing.
[00:32:39.160 --> 00:32:41.680]   But Jesus constantly stands before us.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:44.160]   Before us and God.
[00:32:44.160 --> 00:32:47.480]   Covering us with his blood.
[00:32:47.480 --> 00:32:48.920]   That's why we have security.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:53.760]   He didn't just start and then just kind of let you guys go and say, "Okay, hopefully
[00:32:53.760 --> 00:32:57.720]   some of you guys can make it."
[00:32:57.720 --> 00:33:02.300]   He loved us enough to die for us while we were yet sinners.
[00:33:02.300 --> 00:33:03.300]   And it's illogical.
[00:33:03.300 --> 00:33:08.240]   It doesn't make any sense that he who loved us while we were sinners.
[00:33:08.240 --> 00:33:11.300]   And the scripture tells us that we were enemies of God.
[00:33:11.300 --> 00:33:16.560]   That all of a sudden he said, "Oh my gosh, I didn't know he was going to do that.
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:22.880]   I thought if I poured a little love that there would be some change but nothing happened."
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.540]   While we were yet sinners.
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:29.500]   That never changes.
[00:33:29.500 --> 00:33:31.560]   And that's why we call it unconditional.
[00:33:31.560 --> 00:33:32.640]   We call it unconditional.
[00:33:32.640 --> 00:33:39.200]   We use that term so cliche and so often that it kind of lost its meaning.
[00:33:39.200 --> 00:33:41.600]   But originally that's where the term comes from.
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:44.160]   Unconditional because it is not based upon any condition.
[00:33:44.160 --> 00:33:47.760]   It is not conditioned upon you becoming a diamond.
[00:33:47.760 --> 00:33:53.880]   It's not conditioned upon you being a famous evangelist.
[00:33:53.880 --> 00:33:59.560]   He just decided to love you.
[00:33:59.560 --> 00:34:00.560]   That's the mystery.
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:02.440]   I don't know why.
[00:34:02.440 --> 00:34:04.520]   I don't know why some were chosen and some were not chosen.
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:05.520]   I don't know.
[00:34:05.520 --> 00:34:06.520]   I don't have the answer for that.
[00:34:06.520 --> 00:34:11.280]   But what the Bible does make it clear, what Paul says, we don't even know what to pray
[00:34:11.280 --> 00:34:12.280]   for.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:16.600]   But one thing that we do know, that all things work together for good for those who have
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.200]   been called according to his purpose.
[00:34:19.200 --> 00:34:21.600]   That we know.
[00:34:21.600 --> 00:34:22.600]   That we know.
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   That we know.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:24.600]   That we have security.
[00:34:24.600 --> 00:34:30.800]   We know that we have this confidence in him.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:34.960]   And that's why the final thing that he concludes in all of this thing, he says, "Then who
[00:34:34.960 --> 00:34:37.560]   shall separate us from the love of Christ?"
[00:34:37.560 --> 00:34:42.040]   You see how this crescendo of all these rhetorical questions, but the last of the rhetorical
[00:34:42.040 --> 00:34:46.760]   questions really sums up everything that he says.
[00:34:46.760 --> 00:34:51.080]   All of these things, justification, sanctification, glorification, eternal security, the Holy
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.640]   Spirit, our union with Christ, death and resurrection.
[00:34:54.640 --> 00:34:58.120]   All of this stuff can be summed up by what?
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:01.360]   The love of Christ.
[00:35:01.360 --> 00:35:04.120]   Why can't we be separated?
[00:35:04.120 --> 00:35:07.440]   Because he loves us.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:13.880]   Why do we look at our children like hawks, those of you who have small children?
[00:35:13.880 --> 00:35:14.880]   You love them.
[00:35:14.880 --> 00:35:21.880]   You can't bear to imagine any harm coming to them.
[00:35:21.880 --> 00:35:24.480]   Any parent with small children, I mean you're watching over them.
[00:35:24.480 --> 00:35:25.480]   Where are they?
[00:35:25.480 --> 00:35:26.480]   Are they sticking their finger in the wall?
[00:35:26.480 --> 00:35:27.480]   Who's around them?
[00:35:27.480 --> 00:35:30.800]   Are they going to, even the babysitters, are they going to hurt them?
[00:35:30.800 --> 00:35:31.800]   Are they going to care for them?
[00:35:31.800 --> 00:35:34.040]   And you're watching over a hawk.
[00:35:34.040 --> 00:35:36.080]   And you're a human being.
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:42.840]   The greatest job that you can possibly do is limited by your limitation.
[00:35:42.840 --> 00:35:50.280]   John 3, 16, it says, "For God so loved the world that he gave his only begotten Son."
[00:35:50.280 --> 00:35:57.280]   See that word "so" in "for God so loved the world" isn't saying God so loved the world.
[00:35:57.280 --> 00:36:00.960]   It's saying the way God loved the world.
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:03.400]   That's how it really is written in Greek.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:09.720]   The demonstration of God's love is that he gave his only begotten Son.
[00:36:09.720 --> 00:36:12.120]   How do we know God loves us?
[00:36:12.120 --> 00:36:15.380]   He sent his Son to die for you.
[00:36:15.380 --> 00:36:17.960]   That's how we know he loves us.
[00:36:17.960 --> 00:36:22.920]   Sometimes we want to measure God's love by our bank account, by friendship, by security.
[00:36:22.920 --> 00:36:25.240]   But he says, "No.
[00:36:25.240 --> 00:36:28.640]   What more do you want than the Son of God who died for you?"
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:34.840]   And then he says, "Shall tribulation" - tribulation is talking about outside forces.
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:37.640]   It's a general word that really describes everything.
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:41.720]   "Distress, the inner anxiety that comes from living in a fallen world when things don't
[00:36:41.720 --> 00:36:43.040]   go right.
[00:36:43.040 --> 00:36:47.280]   Persecution, trials that are deliberately brought into our life by the world and our
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   surrounding.
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:53.200]   Famine or nakedness, our basic necessity of food and clothing.
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.600]   Danger, when somebody actually decides to bring harm.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   A sword, even the threat of death."
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.720]   So basically what Paul is saying, he's describing in every circumstance.
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:12.200]   Even trivial things as food and clothing, just someone else's threat.
[00:37:12.200 --> 00:37:15.600]   Danger, even anxiety.
[00:37:15.600 --> 00:37:20.280]   Can any of this separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:25.880]   Is something or anything more powerful in this world than the love of Christ?
[00:37:25.880 --> 00:37:27.200]   See that's the rhetorical question.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:28.680]   What will separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:37:28.680 --> 00:37:31.480]   The answer is pretty obvious.
[00:37:31.480 --> 00:37:33.480]   Nothing.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:35.360]   Nothing.
[00:37:35.360 --> 00:37:39.480]   There is nothing more beautiful in our world than love.
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.760]   Nothing.
[00:37:41.760 --> 00:37:43.560]   Even among human beings.
[00:37:43.560 --> 00:37:47.440]   When you see people falling in love, everybody's like, "Oh."
[00:37:47.440 --> 00:37:50.200]   Nobody's like, "Ew."
[00:37:50.200 --> 00:37:54.800]   Whether it's love between husband and wife or love for mother or children or usually
[00:37:54.800 --> 00:38:02.840]   love and when it is pure, which has no greater love than this, than a friend laid down his
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:03.840]   life.
[00:38:03.840 --> 00:38:08.120]   One person laid down his life for his friend.
[00:38:08.120 --> 00:38:11.800]   But even that description of love doesn't describe Jesus' love.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:14.960]   He didn't lay down his life for his friends.
[00:38:14.960 --> 00:38:20.160]   He laid down his life for enemies and made us friends.
[00:38:20.160 --> 00:38:23.760]   Who shall separate us from this love of Christ?
[00:38:23.760 --> 00:38:25.920]   Nothing.
[00:38:25.920 --> 00:38:29.360]   That's why we have eternal security.
[00:38:29.360 --> 00:38:33.160]   Those of you who are being accused because of your weakness.
[00:38:33.160 --> 00:38:36.100]   Those of you who are living in anxiety.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.600]   Those of you who are questioning, "Am I going to make it?"
[00:38:39.600 --> 00:38:44.680]   If you have true faith, our confidence is in Him.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:51.880]   That's why we are encouraged, challenged, commanded to fix your eyes upon Christ, the
[00:38:51.880 --> 00:38:56.680]   beginner and the finisher of our faith.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:39:01.760]   If it wasn't for Christ, if our confidence wasn't in Him, if it wasn't security in Him
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:08.720]   and His love, we would be overwhelmed with doubt, overwhelmed with anxiety, considering
[00:39:08.720 --> 00:39:10.880]   our opposition.
[00:39:10.880 --> 00:39:13.000]   But that is not us.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:14.880]   Let me conclude with Isaiah 58-9.
[00:39:14.880 --> 00:39:19.440]   It says, "He who vindicates me is near.
[00:39:19.440 --> 00:39:22.720]   He who contends with me, who will contend with me?
[00:39:22.720 --> 00:39:24.720]   Let us stand together.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:26.120]   Who is my adversary?
[00:39:26.120 --> 00:39:27.640]   Let him come near to me.
[00:39:27.640 --> 00:39:30.680]   Behold, the Lord God helps me.
[00:39:30.680 --> 00:39:32.360]   Who will declare me guilty?
[00:39:32.360 --> 00:39:35.200]   Behold, all of them will wear out like a garment.
[00:39:35.200 --> 00:39:38.480]   The moth will eat them up."
[00:39:38.480 --> 00:39:39.480]   Isaiah 45-25.
[00:39:39.480 --> 00:39:46.960]   "I, I am He who blots out your transgressions for my own sake, and I will not remember your
[00:39:46.960 --> 00:39:49.960]   sins."
[00:39:49.960 --> 00:39:52.160]   I want to sing a hymn with you.
[00:39:52.160 --> 00:39:54.680]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up.
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:39:56.800]   And I know you guys are very familiar with this hymn.
[00:39:56.800 --> 00:39:58.960]   If you can turn the lyrics on.
[00:39:58.960 --> 00:40:03.440]   And so instead of inviting you to pray, I'm going to invite you to take some time to reflect
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:07.360]   on the lyrics of this hymn because it basically is a summary of everything that we talked
[00:40:07.360 --> 00:40:08.880]   about this morning.
[00:40:08.880 --> 00:40:10.200]   And it's before the throne of God.
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:14.240]   And I know we sing it, and I know you probably have memorized the song, but I want to go
[00:40:14.240 --> 00:40:16.160]   over the lyrics with you.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.880]   And then I want to sing this together.
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:23.560]   Before the throne of God above, I have a strong and perfect plea.
[00:40:23.560 --> 00:40:30.120]   A great high priest whose name is love, who never lives, who ever lives and pleads for
[00:40:30.120 --> 00:40:31.340]   me.
[00:40:31.340 --> 00:40:33.940]   My name is graven on his hands.
[00:40:33.940 --> 00:40:36.020]   My name is written on his heart.
[00:40:36.020 --> 00:40:42.480]   I know that while in heaven he stands, no tongue can bid me thence depart.
[00:40:42.480 --> 00:40:43.480]   Verse two.
[00:40:43.480 --> 00:40:49.320]   "When Satan tempts me to despair and tells me of the guilt within, upward I look and
[00:40:49.320 --> 00:40:53.440]   see him there who made an end of all my sin.
[00:40:53.440 --> 00:40:57.480]   Because the sinless Savior died, my sinful soul is counted free.
[00:40:57.480 --> 00:41:03.800]   For God the just is satisfied to look on him and pardon me.
[00:41:03.800 --> 00:41:07.320]   Behold him there, the risen lamb, my perfect spotless righteousness.
[00:41:07.320 --> 00:41:11.560]   The great unchangeable I am, the king of glory and of grace.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:13.200]   One in himself I cannot die.
[00:41:13.200 --> 00:41:15.360]   My soul is purchased by his blood.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:20.040]   My life is hid with Christ on high, with Christ my Savior and my God."
[00:41:20.040 --> 00:41:25.040]   So as we sing this hymn together, again I pray that these words of our security that
[00:41:25.040 --> 00:41:27.960]   we have in Christ would really be embedded in our hearts.
[00:41:27.960 --> 00:41:31.760]   And that that would be the foundation in which we build everything that we do.
