[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.160]   (silence)
[00:00:02.160 --> 00:00:05.720]   Studying today.
[00:00:05.720 --> 00:00:07.840]   Father God, we thank you for your grace.
[00:00:07.840 --> 00:00:10.040]   Lord, we thank you for your truth.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:13.700]   I pray, Lord, that truly your spirit would help
[00:00:13.700 --> 00:00:16.560]   in preparing our hearts and the soil of our heart
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:18.800]   that we might be able to receive.
[00:00:18.800 --> 00:00:20.740]   God, I pray that ultimately our church
[00:00:20.740 --> 00:00:24.400]   would continue to be transformed by your truth
[00:00:24.400 --> 00:00:26.600]   into the closer image of your Son,
[00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:28.480]   and Lord, into further obedience.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.640]   Father, we also pray for Pastor Peter.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:32.440]   God, would you continue to be with him,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.720]   using him as a mouthpiece,
[00:00:34.720 --> 00:00:37.080]   as one who's going to speak the word clearly
[00:00:37.080 --> 00:00:39.120]   and powerfully and with great passion,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:40.920]   and that the congregation at Lighthouse
[00:00:40.920 --> 00:00:42.400]   would be challenged.
[00:00:42.400 --> 00:00:44.680]   God, that they would continue to be transformed,
[00:00:44.680 --> 00:00:46.080]   and Lord, that all the more the church
[00:00:46.080 --> 00:00:47.400]   would glorify your name.
[00:00:47.400 --> 00:00:50.240]   Let's say in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:51.080]   Okay.
[00:00:51.080 --> 00:00:56.860]   If you look at the title of the sermon,
[00:00:56.860 --> 00:00:58.200]   it's a servant's perspective,
[00:00:58.200 --> 00:01:00.240]   and we're gonna be talking really
[00:01:00.240 --> 00:01:05.240]   about a frame of thinking, a way of seeing things.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.160]   And I don't know if you've heard this one already,
[00:01:08.160 --> 00:01:11.160]   short little anecdote here, about a college girl.
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:13.160]   She emailed her parents and said,
[00:01:13.160 --> 00:01:16.320]   "Mom and Dad, I've got news.
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:17.480]   "The apartment that I was living at,
[00:01:17.480 --> 00:01:20.360]   "it caught on fire about three months ago.
[00:01:20.360 --> 00:01:23.000]   "I didn't tell you just 'cause fire was my fault."
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:26.280]   But then thankfully, this young dashing boy
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.480]   who lives next to me came and saved me.
[00:01:29.480 --> 00:01:31.600]   But I decided to live with him.
[00:01:31.600 --> 00:01:33.280]   So I'm emailing you to announce to you
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.220]   that on December 15th we're gonna get married.
[00:01:36.220 --> 00:01:38.660]   And then, congratulations are in order
[00:01:38.660 --> 00:01:41.840]   because you guys are gonna be grandparents.
[00:01:41.840 --> 00:01:43.080]   It just gets worse and worse.
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.280]   (laughs)
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:45.760]   But then she says, "The real reason why
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:48.600]   "I actually emailed you and contacted you now
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:50.720]   "is to tell you all this stuff, but what's more,
[00:01:50.720 --> 00:01:52.680]   "is it okay if we move in after we get married?"
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:53.880]   (laughs)
[00:01:53.880 --> 00:01:56.280]   And you can imagine what the parents were thinking
[00:01:56.280 --> 00:01:57.600]   as they read this email.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:01:59.840]   She writes off, "Love, April."
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:02.080]   But then on the very bottom, she like scrolls down more
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.480]   and then writes, "P.S., obviously none of this stuff is true.
[00:02:05.480 --> 00:02:07.840]   "There was no fire, there was no young dashing boy,
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.300]   "I'm not even dating.
[00:02:09.300 --> 00:02:11.340]   "I'm not pregnant, and of course I'm not getting married.
[00:02:11.340 --> 00:02:14.160]   "But I got an F in bio,
[00:02:14.160 --> 00:02:16.600]   "and I'm just putting things in perspective.
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.680]   "Like how bad things could potentially be."
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:20.440]   (laughs)
[00:02:20.440 --> 00:02:22.440]   Thought that was hilarious, it's really good.
[00:02:22.440 --> 00:02:23.680]   (laughs)
[00:02:23.680 --> 00:02:25.920]   Well, the whole idea is there's perspective
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:28.080]   that we all have pertaining to certain matters.
[00:02:28.080 --> 00:02:30.560]   Sometimes, if we have a perspective
[00:02:30.560 --> 00:02:32.920]   that's too narrowly focused on one thing,
[00:02:32.920 --> 00:02:35.400]   then that one thing becomes all.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:38.120]   That one thing becomes dominating, right?
[00:02:38.120 --> 00:02:39.700]   But then sometimes if we have a perspective
[00:02:39.700 --> 00:02:41.280]   that's too broad and spread out,
[00:02:41.280 --> 00:02:43.200]   then nothing's truly important.
[00:02:43.200 --> 00:02:45.560]   Nothing really stands out.
[00:02:45.560 --> 00:02:48.000]   Well, the reason why I'm talking about perspective
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:50.160]   is because I'm reading through the Book of Acts,
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:51.560]   and today we're gonna walk through
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:53.740]   chapters one through five of Book of Acts.
[00:02:53.740 --> 00:02:56.160]   And as I see the early church,
[00:02:56.160 --> 00:02:58.200]   and particularly the disciples,
[00:02:58.200 --> 00:03:00.840]   and from there even more particularly,
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:04.720]   Apostle Peter, I see a change in perspective.
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.600]   I see a change in the way that they view the world,
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:08.740]   the way that they view God,
[00:03:08.740 --> 00:03:09.980]   the way that they view the church,
[00:03:09.980 --> 00:03:12.520]   the way that they view themselves.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:15.280]   And they're constantly having a change of perspective.
[00:03:15.280 --> 00:03:16.880]   And I believe it's helpful for us
[00:03:16.880 --> 00:03:19.680]   to look into the lives of faithful men,
[00:03:19.680 --> 00:03:22.780]   not simply to observe what did they do, let me imitate,
[00:03:22.780 --> 00:03:25.400]   but what is the content of their faith?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.560]   What were they thinking?
[00:03:27.560 --> 00:03:29.080]   What did they believe?
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:32.560]   And if you remember, the disciples prior to
[00:03:32.560 --> 00:03:34.400]   Jesus going to the cross,
[00:03:34.400 --> 00:03:37.600]   Jesus constantly was trying to guide and lead them,
[00:03:37.600 --> 00:03:40.320]   and telling them what his plans were.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:42.080]   But if you remember in the Gospels,
[00:03:42.080 --> 00:03:44.480]   majority of the time they just didn't get it.
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:48.060]   Even though Jesus said, "I want you to be fishers of men,"
[00:03:48.060 --> 00:03:49.920]   they were just tagging along with him.
[00:03:49.920 --> 00:03:52.920]   And then Jesus talked about the kind of sacrifice
[00:03:52.920 --> 00:03:55.640]   it requires, the kind of walk they would have to go through,
[00:03:55.640 --> 00:03:58.760]   through the path of suffering in order to get there.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:00.480]   But the vast majority of them said,
[00:04:00.480 --> 00:04:03.880]   "Nah, can we just have your right hand,
[00:04:03.880 --> 00:04:05.440]   "the seat at your right hand?
[00:04:05.440 --> 00:04:07.600]   "Can we have the power with you when you come?
[00:04:07.600 --> 00:04:09.400]   "When's it gonna be the glory?"
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:11.360]   That's typically what they were thinking.
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:13.360]   But then if you look at their lives in the book of Acts,
[00:04:13.360 --> 00:04:16.000]   their perspective has completely changed.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.660]   That's what I wanna look at today.
[00:04:18.660 --> 00:04:21.460]   Namely, when you look at Apostle Peter,
[00:04:21.460 --> 00:04:24.820]   Apostle Peter was one who was out there.
[00:04:24.820 --> 00:04:27.020]   He was the one who was speaking first.
[00:04:27.020 --> 00:04:29.980]   He wanted to be a leader amongst his equals.
[00:04:29.980 --> 00:04:31.540]   But you know what's quite interesting is that
[00:04:31.540 --> 00:04:34.820]   subsequent to the Holy Spirit coming in in the book of Acts,
[00:04:34.820 --> 00:04:37.980]   you see him serving as a servant of all.
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:42.420]   You see him even designate himself as a servant of God.
[00:04:42.420 --> 00:04:45.780]   And later when we read in the New Testament,
[00:04:45.780 --> 00:04:46.900]   in 2 Peter he says,
[00:04:46.900 --> 00:04:50.640]   "I am a servant of the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:04:50.640 --> 00:04:53.120]   What perspective has changed?
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:55.100]   What insight did he gain?
[00:04:55.100 --> 00:04:56.940]   That's what we're going to look at today.
[00:04:56.940 --> 00:04:59.040]   Turn your Bibles over to Acts chapter one.
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:07.740]   We're gonna be reading from verse four through nine
[00:05:07.740 --> 00:05:11.040]   and then various passages from chapters one through five.
[00:05:11.040 --> 00:05:13.680]   But in Acts chapter one, verses four through nine,
[00:05:13.680 --> 00:05:18.420]   this is what is happening as Jesus is guiding the disciples.
[00:05:18.420 --> 00:05:22.100]   Gathering together, he commanded them not to leave Jerusalem
[00:05:22.100 --> 00:05:24.700]   but to wait for what the Father had promised.
[00:05:24.700 --> 00:05:26.940]   Which he said, "You heard from me."
[00:05:26.940 --> 00:05:29.540]   So this is what you heard even from before.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:30.900]   "For John baptized with water,
[00:05:30.900 --> 00:05:32.940]   "but you will baptize with the Holy Spirit
[00:05:32.940 --> 00:05:35.140]   "not many days from now."
[00:05:35.140 --> 00:05:36.560]   So when they had come together,
[00:05:36.560 --> 00:05:37.700]   they were asking him, saying,
[00:05:37.700 --> 00:05:39.580]   "Lord, is it at this time
[00:05:39.580 --> 00:05:41.780]   "you are restoring the kingdom of Israel?"
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.300]   He said to them, "It is not for you to know times or epochs
[00:05:45.300 --> 00:05:47.780]   "which the Father has fixed by his own authority.
[00:05:47.780 --> 00:05:48.980]   "But you will receive power
[00:05:48.980 --> 00:05:51.040]   "when the Holy Spirit has come upon you.
[00:05:51.040 --> 00:05:53.700]   "And you shall be my witnesses both in Jerusalem
[00:05:53.700 --> 00:05:56.020]   "and in all Judea and Samaria,
[00:05:56.020 --> 00:05:58.940]   "even to the remotest part of the earth."
[00:05:58.940 --> 00:06:02.220]   And so what you have, essentially,
[00:06:02.220 --> 00:06:05.580]   is Jesus giving them the same commandments
[00:06:05.580 --> 00:06:08.100]   that he was giving them from before.
[00:06:08.100 --> 00:06:11.300]   He wanted them to be disciples, carriers of the gospel,
[00:06:11.300 --> 00:06:12.980]   and he's reiterating to them
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:15.660]   what he is desiring them to fulfill.
[00:06:15.660 --> 00:06:19.500]   And he's telling them, not just simply what to do,
[00:06:19.500 --> 00:06:21.580]   but the plan by which they are going to do it,
[00:06:21.580 --> 00:06:23.220]   the region of where they're going to do it,
[00:06:23.220 --> 00:06:25.700]   and by the power to which they're going to do this.
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:29.460]   He's got this meticulously planned out.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:32.620]   So I come to our first point of the sermon,
[00:06:32.620 --> 00:06:34.740]   which is, as we take a look at Apostle Peter,
[00:06:34.740 --> 00:06:37.960]   we can see the servant's purpose.
[00:06:37.960 --> 00:06:39.860]   The servant's purpose.
[00:06:40.860 --> 00:06:43.900]   And what I'm saying is this.
[00:06:43.900 --> 00:06:47.780]   Perhaps what has changed previous
[00:06:47.780 --> 00:06:52.220]   to when Jesus was walking with the disciples on earth,
[00:06:52.220 --> 00:06:54.300]   to here and now in the book of Acts,
[00:06:54.300 --> 00:06:56.820]   how Apostle Peter starts to function,
[00:06:56.820 --> 00:07:00.580]   is he has a greater understanding of God's purpose.
[00:07:00.580 --> 00:07:04.700]   There's a sense in which each and every single one of you,
[00:07:04.700 --> 00:07:08.140]   if I were to ask you, what is God's purpose,
[00:07:08.140 --> 00:07:10.380]   to some degree you would be able to answer.
[00:07:10.380 --> 00:07:14.360]   But then there is a point to be made, which is,
[00:07:14.360 --> 00:07:17.140]   do we have a conviction?
[00:07:17.140 --> 00:07:19.160]   Do we understand in grand scale,
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:21.460]   this is what God is doing now?
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:24.100]   This is his plan, this is how he works.
[00:07:24.100 --> 00:07:25.820]   Are we able to understand that
[00:07:25.820 --> 00:07:27.380]   by our understanding of scripture,
[00:07:27.380 --> 00:07:29.680]   by us investigating, hearing sermons,
[00:07:29.680 --> 00:07:31.240]   and going in our own devotions?
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:33.220]   Are we able to see not so much,
[00:07:33.220 --> 00:07:36.420]   hey, let me hear an encouraging word from me today.
[00:07:36.420 --> 00:07:38.460]   What does God want me to do about my job,
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:41.860]   my girlfriend, or whatever it may be?
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:44.440]   But simply the question of what is God doing
[00:07:44.440 --> 00:07:46.980]   in his ultimate purpose and plan?
[00:07:46.980 --> 00:07:49.860]   Is that something we have a conviction about?
[00:07:49.860 --> 00:07:52.080]   That's an important question to ask.
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:57.020]   Because I believe Apostle Peter starts to gain insight
[00:07:57.020 --> 00:07:58.500]   and starts to connect the dots
[00:07:58.500 --> 00:08:01.020]   of all that he's experienced before and then now,
[00:08:01.020 --> 00:08:04.580]   and he's able to see this is the purpose of God.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.820]   Let me make this case with you.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:11.820]   For example, if you look in chapter two,
[00:08:11.820 --> 00:08:14.000]   chapter two, verse 17.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.900]   Okay?
[00:08:16.900 --> 00:08:20.580]   Essentially, what's happening is,
[00:08:20.580 --> 00:08:21.880]   as I'm gonna tell you the story
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:24.180]   as you are turning your Bibles to that passage,
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:25.400]   chapter two, 17.
[00:08:25.400 --> 00:08:29.360]   Essentially, as Jesus commanded them, they waited.
[00:08:29.360 --> 00:08:31.520]   The Holy Spirit fell,
[00:08:31.520 --> 00:08:33.860]   and there was miraculous things happening.
[00:08:33.860 --> 00:08:35.660]   People were speaking in tongues.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:37.660]   They were being filled with the Spirit.
[00:08:37.660 --> 00:08:39.340]   There was bold preaching.
[00:08:39.340 --> 00:08:41.900]   And a lot of other people's observing were thinking,
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:43.540]   you guys are like early drunkards.
[00:08:43.540 --> 00:08:44.780]   This is not even halfway through the day,
[00:08:44.780 --> 00:08:45.820]   and you guys are drunk.
[00:08:45.820 --> 00:08:49.040]   Apostle Peter takes that opportunity to preach,
[00:08:49.040 --> 00:08:52.000]   to preach about Christ, Christ who was crucified,
[00:08:52.000 --> 00:08:54.500]   Christ who is the Lord, okay?
[00:08:54.500 --> 00:08:59.460]   And then, here he is in verse 17, talking about this.
[00:08:59.460 --> 00:09:04.460]   So, I'm jumping in to where Apostle Peter is preaching.
[00:09:04.460 --> 00:09:06.380]   And in verse 17, he says this.
[00:09:06.380 --> 00:09:10.020]   And it shall be in the last days, God says,
[00:09:10.020 --> 00:09:12.380]   that I will pour forth my Spirit on all mankind,
[00:09:12.380 --> 00:09:15.140]   and your sons and your daughters shall prophesy,
[00:09:15.140 --> 00:09:16.660]   and your young men shall see visions,
[00:09:16.660 --> 00:09:19.220]   your old men shall dream dreams.
[00:09:19.220 --> 00:09:21.740]   Even on my boss life, both men and women,
[00:09:21.740 --> 00:09:24.820]   I will in those days pour forth my Spirit,
[00:09:24.820 --> 00:09:26.780]   and they shall prophesy.
[00:09:26.780 --> 00:09:27.740]   Okay.
[00:09:27.740 --> 00:09:30.020]   Now, as you look at this passage,
[00:09:30.020 --> 00:09:32.140]   one thing that I notice is,
[00:09:32.140 --> 00:09:33.660]   Apostle Peter is preaching,
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:35.380]   and man, take a look at chapter two.
[00:09:35.380 --> 00:09:38.420]   There's a whole bunch of references to the Old Testament.
[00:09:38.420 --> 00:09:41.060]   Why are you referencing the Old Testament
[00:09:41.060 --> 00:09:42.820]   so much, Apostle Peter?
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:45.020]   There could be a sense in which maybe it's because
[00:09:45.020 --> 00:09:47.660]   his audience was primarily Jewish.
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:49.380]   But I would like to make the case,
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:53.620]   he's making this sermon so packed
[00:09:53.620 --> 00:09:55.580]   with the previous promises of old,
[00:09:55.580 --> 00:09:58.260]   because he sees the plan of God.
[00:09:58.260 --> 00:10:00.300]   He sees the working of God.
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:02.140]   And if you notice that short verse I read to you
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.340]   in verse 17 and 18,
[00:10:04.340 --> 00:10:06.340]   in that passage, you see him saying,
[00:10:06.340 --> 00:10:09.220]   "This is what God says he was going to do.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:11.940]   "God wanted to pour his Spirit out.
[00:10:11.940 --> 00:10:13.660]   "God wanted to fill the people.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:15.840]   "God wanted to reach out, not just to the Jews,
[00:10:15.840 --> 00:10:16.900]   "but to the Gentiles.
[00:10:16.900 --> 00:10:18.540]   "He wanted to reach out, not just to the rich,
[00:10:18.540 --> 00:10:19.460]   "but to the poor.
[00:10:19.460 --> 00:10:21.500]   "This was the plan of the Lord."
[00:10:23.740 --> 00:10:27.420]   Are you guys amazed and convicted
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:29.940]   about that sort of plan of God?
[00:10:29.940 --> 00:10:31.620]   Do you have that kind of understanding?
[00:10:31.620 --> 00:10:34.140]   This is what God has been doing from ages before.
[00:10:34.140 --> 00:10:35.260]   He is doing this today,
[00:10:35.260 --> 00:10:38.180]   and he's gonna fulfill it into the future.
[00:10:38.180 --> 00:10:42.940]   Apostle Peter has a grip and grasp on what God is doing.
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.980]   Let me make this case a little further.
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:47.740]   In verse 22 and following,
[00:10:47.740 --> 00:10:49.980]   this is what he says, 22 and following,
[00:10:49.980 --> 00:10:52.620]   men of Israel, listen to these words.
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:55.780]   "Jesus, the Nazarene, a man attested to you by God
[00:10:55.780 --> 00:10:58.440]   "with miracles, wonders, and signs,
[00:10:58.440 --> 00:11:02.180]   "which God performed through him in your midst."
[00:11:02.180 --> 00:11:03.940]   This was God's doing.
[00:11:03.940 --> 00:11:05.220]   "Just as you yourselves know,
[00:11:05.220 --> 00:11:08.620]   "this man delivered over to the predetermined plan
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:10.740]   "and foreknowledge of God.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:14.760]   "You nailed to a cross by the hands of godless men
[00:11:14.760 --> 00:11:16.420]   "and put him to death.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:18.580]   "But God raised him up again,
[00:11:18.580 --> 00:11:20.420]   "putting an end to the agony of death,
[00:11:20.420 --> 00:11:25.420]   "since it is impossible for him to be held in its power."
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:29.460]   So what I'm saying is, as I read through the book of Acts,
[00:11:29.460 --> 00:11:32.940]   I saw not only was it just historical accounts,
[00:11:32.940 --> 00:11:35.740]   a story of how the early church came to rise,
[00:11:35.740 --> 00:11:37.460]   how the people were being saved,
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.940]   and 3,000, 5,000 people were coming to the church.
[00:11:40.940 --> 00:11:44.300]   It was an account of the working of God,
[00:11:44.300 --> 00:11:46.380]   and Apostle Peter recognized it.
[00:11:46.380 --> 00:11:49.420]   He recognized it.
[00:11:49.420 --> 00:11:52.380]   And so you will see, if you continue to read the book,
[00:11:52.380 --> 00:11:55.020]   that Apostle Peter is going to constantly reference,
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:56.340]   this is what God's been doing,
[00:11:56.340 --> 00:11:58.260]   this is what he was doing before.
[00:11:58.260 --> 00:12:00.860]   And that language is chock full in here.
[00:12:00.860 --> 00:12:04.580]   Now why am I talking about this?
[00:12:04.580 --> 00:12:06.620]   I'm talking about a servant's heart,
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:10.380]   his perspective, and so forth,
[00:12:10.380 --> 00:12:12.900]   and the kind of attitude that he has.
[00:12:12.900 --> 00:12:15.660]   It's because I bet every single one of us here
[00:12:15.660 --> 00:12:18.820]   has at one point or another asked a question,
[00:12:18.820 --> 00:12:21.180]   what is God's purpose for me?
[00:12:21.180 --> 00:12:24.460]   What does God want me to do?
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   What is my role, lot in life, that God has laid out for me?
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:30.900]   I mean, he's the one who we plan our ways,
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:32.620]   but God truly sets our path, right?
[00:12:32.620 --> 00:12:34.260]   So what is that for me?
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:36.140]   Great question.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:37.220]   Great question.
[00:12:37.220 --> 00:12:38.300]   You should ask that.
[00:12:38.300 --> 00:12:40.860]   But sometimes we don't realize
[00:12:40.860 --> 00:12:42.060]   there is a preliminary question
[00:12:42.060 --> 00:12:43.500]   that needs to be asked first.
[00:12:43.500 --> 00:12:46.260]   Simply, what is God's plan, period?
[00:12:46.260 --> 00:12:48.660]   You see my point?
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:50.860]   Because a servant's heart could get inundated
[00:12:50.860 --> 00:12:54.060]   with what's my role, what can I do?
[00:12:54.060 --> 00:12:57.220]   But the fact of the matter is he needs to first ask,
[00:12:57.220 --> 00:13:00.580]   master, what are you trying to accomplish here?
[00:13:00.580 --> 00:13:01.860]   What are you doing?
[00:13:01.860 --> 00:13:02.940]   Let me observe.
[00:13:02.940 --> 00:13:07.620]   What is God planning, executing, promising?
[00:13:07.620 --> 00:13:10.980]   And let me serve that.
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:13.220]   You see the difference in heart?
[00:13:13.220 --> 00:13:16.100]   You see, a slave in a household,
[00:13:16.100 --> 00:13:17.980]   he can want responsibility.
[00:13:18.980 --> 00:13:21.420]   But that wanting of responsibility
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:23.540]   does not make him a humble servant.
[00:13:23.540 --> 00:13:24.460]   Why?
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:25.980]   Because he could be asking questions like,
[00:13:25.980 --> 00:13:28.980]   when are you gonna give me authority over the other slaves?
[00:13:28.980 --> 00:13:31.860]   When are you gonna give me the key to the house?
[00:13:31.860 --> 00:13:34.060]   He wants responsibility, right?
[00:13:34.060 --> 00:13:36.260]   But is that the heart of the servant?
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.500]   No, it's not.
[00:13:39.500 --> 00:13:42.860]   The heart of the servant understands first and foremost
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:45.940]   the purposes of God, and he has a conviction,
[00:13:45.940 --> 00:13:47.780]   this is what my master is doing.
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:50.580]   And then he has a buy-in, he has an adopting
[00:13:50.580 --> 00:13:52.740]   of that purpose into his own life,
[00:13:52.740 --> 00:13:54.460]   and that's called conviction.
[00:13:54.460 --> 00:13:59.660]   I believe that's what we need more than anything in our day.
[00:13:59.660 --> 00:14:02.860]   A clear purpose to which we can attach ourselves to.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:04.380]   And it's gotta be greater than,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.860]   what is my lot for me at school?
[00:14:06.860 --> 00:14:09.380]   Next five years, what am I gonna accomplish?
[00:14:09.380 --> 00:14:13.860]   As I'm thinking about that, I'm brought to a thought.
[00:14:13.860 --> 00:14:15.740]   I've wrestled with the thought of leadership
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:19.700]   a lot in my life, because I don't know if,
[00:14:19.700 --> 00:14:21.820]   some people say, oh, I think you have good leadership traits,
[00:14:21.820 --> 00:14:24.180]   some people say, yeah, you don't have certain things,
[00:14:24.180 --> 00:14:26.940]   and I appreciate that 'cause they're being truthful.
[00:14:26.940 --> 00:14:29.500]   There are things that I just am not naturally good at.
[00:14:29.500 --> 00:14:32.700]   I can't handle multiple thoughts at once.
[00:14:32.700 --> 00:14:35.060]   I can't do certain things like,
[00:14:35.060 --> 00:14:37.620]   I'm not a vision setter, you know what I mean?
[00:14:37.620 --> 00:14:40.900]   I'm not one who's creative and all that kind of stuff.
[00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.020]   Recently I drew something on a big board
[00:14:44.020 --> 00:14:45.500]   for a Reformation night, and some people were like,
[00:14:45.500 --> 00:14:48.340]   oh, you're so artistic, but in my mind, I'm not.
[00:14:48.340 --> 00:14:49.380]   You know why?
[00:14:49.380 --> 00:14:50.700]   'Cause I copied that thing.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:55.380]   I'm not creative in the sense
[00:14:55.380 --> 00:14:57.860]   that I don't originate stuff, you know?
[00:14:57.860 --> 00:14:59.660]   Like, I'm not gonna embarrass you.
[00:14:59.660 --> 00:15:01.340]   I think there are people, I'm just gonna point that way,
[00:15:01.340 --> 00:15:04.780]   he's really creative because he's expressing stuff
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:07.820]   that's in his mind and in his heart in an original way.
[00:15:07.820 --> 00:15:10.340]   He's not looking on Google Docs and being like,
[00:15:10.340 --> 00:15:12.580]   or Google and being like, image of whatever,
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:13.860]   and just copying it down.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:16.660]   That's not an artist.
[00:15:16.660 --> 00:15:19.220]   That's a copy, like a copy or an imitator.
[00:15:19.220 --> 00:15:20.860]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:15:20.860 --> 00:15:22.380]   Now, the reason why I'm talking about this
[00:15:22.380 --> 00:15:24.700]   because that translates into sometimes,
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:27.700]   for me, into leadership.
[00:15:27.700 --> 00:15:30.100]   Because your secular environment will tell you
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.100]   leadership means you do have to be an innovator.
[00:15:33.100 --> 00:15:36.300]   You have to be creative, and you have to be a visionary.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:37.820]   You have to give the congregation
[00:15:37.820 --> 00:15:40.260]   or in a business context, the business,
[00:15:40.260 --> 00:15:43.060]   next step, next vision, new project,
[00:15:43.060 --> 00:15:44.140]   or whatever it may be.
[00:15:44.140 --> 00:15:45.540]   But if you were to ask me, like,
[00:15:45.540 --> 00:15:47.100]   what's your vision for the next five years?
[00:15:47.100 --> 00:15:51.020]   Like, duh, same thing we've been doing, man.
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.980]   Like, we're preaching, you know,
[00:15:52.980 --> 00:15:54.900]   we're like ministering and discipling,
[00:15:54.900 --> 00:15:56.780]   and that's a problem, right?
[00:15:56.780 --> 00:15:58.860]   Because then I start to question, like,
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.540]   am I gonna ever be a good leader?
[00:16:00.540 --> 00:16:03.300]   But here's the thing.
[00:16:03.300 --> 00:16:06.140]   There is wisdom and value to all of that.
[00:16:06.140 --> 00:16:07.540]   I think we should be creative.
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.700]   I think we should be visionary.
[00:16:09.700 --> 00:16:11.860]   But the fact of the Christian faith is,
[00:16:11.860 --> 00:16:15.540]   many Christian leaders have made a muck of the situation
[00:16:15.540 --> 00:16:17.420]   because they've had their own visions,
[00:16:17.420 --> 00:16:20.460]   their own ambitions, new, innovative things
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:24.300]   that stand in contrast to an age-old faith.
[00:16:24.300 --> 00:16:31.460]   Apostle Peter didn't need new, innovative stuff.
[00:16:31.460 --> 00:16:36.580]   He needed to recognize what God has been doing for ages.
[00:16:36.580 --> 00:16:39.900]   We have a God who's made promises ages ago,
[00:16:39.900 --> 00:16:41.140]   and he's being faithful today.
[00:16:41.140 --> 00:16:43.380]   We have a God who has given faith
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:46.500]   that is a faith that is from an age-old time.
[00:16:46.500 --> 00:16:49.540]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:16:49.540 --> 00:16:52.180]   For me, I realize being a visionary
[00:16:52.180 --> 00:16:54.740]   doesn't necessarily mean being this creative guy
[00:16:54.740 --> 00:16:57.100]   who paints this brand-new, innovative thing
[00:16:57.100 --> 00:16:59.500]   for all of us to follow.
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:01.340]   You just need to clearly have a conviction
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:03.020]   of what is God doing.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:07.620]   And if you have a servant's heart, then you buy into that.
[00:17:07.620 --> 00:17:10.300]   God, I'm not about my own ambitions.
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:11.780]   I'm not about what I need to do,
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:14.700]   my responsibility, my role.
[00:17:14.700 --> 00:17:17.620]   I want people to recognize me as a servant of God.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:18.460]   No.
[00:17:18.460 --> 00:17:20.940]   If I have a true servant's heart,
[00:17:20.940 --> 00:17:24.360]   I see the purposes of God, and I lean into it.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:26.140]   Does that make sense?
[00:17:26.140 --> 00:17:29.500]   And so, you know, I ask you this question.
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:33.140]   Have you asked, "Lord, what's your plan for me?"
[00:17:34.040 --> 00:17:36.380]   There is a way in which you need
[00:17:36.380 --> 00:17:37.940]   to answer previous questions.
[00:17:37.940 --> 00:17:40.860]   Do I understand how the Lord is working?
[00:17:40.860 --> 00:17:44.180]   What are his main objectives?
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:47.260]   What is his main purpose?
[00:17:47.260 --> 00:17:49.380]   That question needs to be asked.
[00:17:49.380 --> 00:17:51.660]   Because do you remember in Romans chapter nine,
[00:17:51.660 --> 00:17:53.340]   Apostle Paul asked this question.
[00:17:53.340 --> 00:17:54.180]   What if,
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:59.600]   what if God chose to show his wrath,
[00:17:59.600 --> 00:18:03.100]   and then he had objects of wrath?
[00:18:03.960 --> 00:18:04.800]   What if?
[00:18:04.800 --> 00:18:11.380]   What if God chose to show his long-suffering patience?
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:15.440]   What if God chose to reveal certain things
[00:18:15.440 --> 00:18:17.080]   in our day and in our life,
[00:18:17.080 --> 00:18:18.200]   but we're still sitting here, like,
[00:18:18.200 --> 00:18:21.040]   "I know, I know, but what's your plan for me?"
[00:18:21.040 --> 00:18:24.480]   Do you see the discrepancy?
[00:18:24.480 --> 00:18:26.000]   And so, my challenge to you is,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:27.140]   if you've been wrestling with that,
[00:18:27.140 --> 00:18:29.900]   like I have in the past many times,
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.480]   there are greater purposes of God,
[00:18:31.480 --> 00:18:33.000]   greater than me, greater than you,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:35.760]   greater than this church.
[00:18:35.760 --> 00:18:38.120]   And remember, that this is what Apostle Peter
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:40.280]   struggled with a lot with Jesus Christ,
[00:18:40.280 --> 00:18:42.440]   that when Jesus Christ said, "I'm going to die,"
[00:18:42.440 --> 00:18:44.340]   Apostle Peter would be the first one to be like,
[00:18:44.340 --> 00:18:46.960]   "Nah, not if you're with me.
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.080]   "I've got a sword."
[00:18:48.080 --> 00:18:52.420]   And Jesus is saying, "Get behind me.
[00:18:52.420 --> 00:18:53.720]   "Peter, get behind me."
[00:18:53.720 --> 00:18:58.600]   Jesus submitted to a greater plan of God.
[00:18:58.600 --> 00:19:01.240]   Here's Apostle Peter going against it.
[00:19:01.240 --> 00:19:03.480]   But I think after all the crucifixion
[00:19:03.480 --> 00:19:05.600]   and the resurrection and the Holy Spirit
[00:19:05.600 --> 00:19:07.080]   and all the things that Jesus is saying
[00:19:07.080 --> 00:19:08.320]   is coming to fruition,
[00:19:08.320 --> 00:19:10.880]   Apostle Peter now has greater sight to see.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:14.760]   The purposes of God come to pass,
[00:19:14.760 --> 00:19:16.660]   and that's the final word.
[00:19:16.660 --> 00:19:19.960]   I don't have my own purposes.
[00:19:19.960 --> 00:19:22.480]   I buy into the purposes of the Lord.
[00:19:22.480 --> 00:19:25.160]   And if you turn with me to chapter three,
[00:19:25.160 --> 00:19:28.040]   chapter three, verse 19 through 22,
[00:19:28.040 --> 00:19:31.320]   Apostle Peter has different opportunities to preach.
[00:19:31.320 --> 00:19:34.640]   What essentially happens is there is this paralytic.
[00:19:34.640 --> 00:19:36.480]   He's been disabled since birth,
[00:19:36.480 --> 00:19:38.160]   but now he's almost 40 years old.
[00:19:38.160 --> 00:19:39.600]   Can you imagine?
[00:19:39.600 --> 00:19:41.640]   40 years old, begging all his life.
[00:19:41.640 --> 00:19:43.640]   He's at the temple gates.
[00:19:43.640 --> 00:19:45.880]   Apostle Peter and John heal this man,
[00:19:45.880 --> 00:19:47.320]   and the people go nuts.
[00:19:47.320 --> 00:19:49.920]   Oh my gosh, we have a miracle working on here, you know?
[00:19:49.920 --> 00:19:51.680]   And now you know what you know is
[00:19:51.680 --> 00:19:53.640]   that you've got these masses of people
[00:19:53.640 --> 00:19:55.880]   coming and clinging on their cloak
[00:19:55.880 --> 00:19:57.200]   and walking in their shadow,
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:59.400]   and people are being healed left and right,
[00:19:59.400 --> 00:20:01.920]   and miraculous things are happening.
[00:20:01.920 --> 00:20:04.600]   But then Apostle Peter again takes this opportunity
[00:20:04.600 --> 00:20:07.280]   to preach boldly, and look at what he says,
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:08.940]   verse 19 through 22.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:11.600]   Masses of people are coming.
[00:20:11.600 --> 00:20:13.160]   You would think he would say great,
[00:20:13.160 --> 00:20:15.940]   but he says no, therefore repent and return,
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:18.280]   so that your sins may be wiped away,
[00:20:18.280 --> 00:20:20.160]   in order that tides of refreshing may come
[00:20:20.160 --> 00:20:21.400]   from the presence of the Lord,
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.640]   and that he may send Jesus.
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:25.000]   If you're a good student of the Bible,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.280]   you notice you have purpose clauses.
[00:20:29.280 --> 00:20:34.040]   So that, in order that, that this may happen.
[00:20:34.040 --> 00:20:36.480]   And you gotta see his rationale.
[00:20:36.480 --> 00:20:39.520]   And he says that God may send Jesus,
[00:20:39.520 --> 00:20:40.880]   the Christ appointed for you,
[00:20:40.880 --> 00:20:43.280]   whom heaven must receive until the period
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:45.880]   of restoration of all things about which God spoke
[00:20:45.880 --> 00:20:48.320]   by the mouth of his prophets, from when?
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:50.160]   Ancient times.
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:52.500]   Moses said the Lord God will raise up for you
[00:20:52.500 --> 00:20:54.560]   a prophet like me from your brethren,
[00:20:54.560 --> 00:20:56.800]   and to him you shall give heed to everything
[00:20:56.800 --> 00:20:58.140]   he says to you.
[00:20:58.140 --> 00:21:03.560]   For me, what I see is Apostle Peter getting convicted
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.520]   about the purposes of God.
[00:21:05.520 --> 00:21:08.240]   Let me highlight for you from just that short little phrase
[00:21:08.240 --> 00:21:09.320]   exactly what I've been saying.
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:11.160]   He sees the purposes of God,
[00:21:11.160 --> 00:21:14.760]   saying God wants to see the forgiveness of sins.
[00:21:14.760 --> 00:21:19.000]   Do you have a conviction of that?
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   Have you ever said I've bought into this vision,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:23.560]   and I wanna see people forgiven?
[00:21:23.560 --> 00:21:25.440]   That would bring me so much joy,
[00:21:25.440 --> 00:21:28.160]   to see people forgiven.
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:31.560]   God wants to see the kingdom come in Christ.
[00:21:31.560 --> 00:21:33.760]   God wants to see the wrath of God,
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:36.560]   his own wrath, be avoided by the children of men.
[00:21:36.560 --> 00:21:39.440]   God wants to see blessings realized in the life of men.
[00:21:39.440 --> 00:21:43.000]   He wants to see obedience to the Son, the Lord of all.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.400]   These are some purposes that we can attach ourselves to.
[00:21:48.400 --> 00:21:52.000]   And so my question to you is,
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:54.080]   if you need a readjusting,
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:21:56.800]   take this to heart.
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:59.640]   My challenge to you is see Apostle Peter
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:01.040]   and his convictions.
[00:22:01.040 --> 00:22:05.520]   And what's gonna happen is that as you do this,
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:09.760]   you will have greater clarity about your own life.
[00:22:09.760 --> 00:22:12.720]   You will start to realize, where do I fit?
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:14.600]   You need a bigger picture.
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.580]   If you start from you, your perspective is like this.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:21.600]   It's like this.
[00:22:21.600 --> 00:22:23.240]   So that's the first point that we realize
[00:22:23.240 --> 00:22:25.360]   is we have to see the purposes of God
[00:22:25.360 --> 00:22:27.160]   and have conviction over it.
[00:22:27.160 --> 00:22:29.960]   So we saw the servant's purpose.
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:33.360]   Next, we see the servant's persistence.
[00:22:33.360 --> 00:22:35.440]   The servant's persistence.
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.840]   Apostle Peter sees the purposes of God,
[00:22:39.840 --> 00:22:41.480]   he's bought into it,
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:44.960]   and when he knows for certain that this is the will of God,
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.560]   you can't stop him.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:48.640]   You can't stop him.
[00:22:49.840 --> 00:22:52.800]   You see, the story unfolds in the book of Acts.
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:54.160]   You would think, okay,
[00:22:54.160 --> 00:22:57.720]   the apostles are preaching with confidence and boldness,
[00:22:57.720 --> 00:23:01.000]   and then it says that 3,000 people come to faith.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.240]   Can you imagine 3,000 people coming to faith?
[00:23:05.240 --> 00:23:08.440]   If you've ever been to a high school graduation,
[00:23:08.440 --> 00:23:10.200]   that's typically like 3,000 people.
[00:23:10.200 --> 00:23:12.440]   When you have a big auditorium
[00:23:12.440 --> 00:23:14.960]   with all the high schoolers in there, 3,000 people.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:17.640]   Can you imagine that many people coming to faith
[00:23:17.640 --> 00:23:19.080]   after one sermon?
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:22.600]   For those of you guys who are logistical and administrative,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.840]   that would be like a nightmare, right?
[00:23:24.840 --> 00:23:26.480]   Oh my God, what do we do?
[00:23:26.480 --> 00:23:27.560]   What do we do about discipleship?
[00:23:27.560 --> 00:23:29.280]   What do we do about even bathrooms?
[00:23:29.280 --> 00:23:30.920]   What do we do about this and that?
[00:23:30.920 --> 00:23:32.640]   But it was just amazing stuff happening,
[00:23:32.640 --> 00:23:35.360]   and God was providing, God was raising up leaders,
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:37.960]   God was using the ministry of the apostles and the teaching,
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:39.240]   and people were being devoted.
[00:23:39.240 --> 00:23:41.880]   There was fellowship, and things were going great.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:45.440]   So you would think that after all this preaching,
[00:23:45.440 --> 00:23:48.160]   that the life of the pastor, the apostles,
[00:23:48.160 --> 00:23:49.240]   would be great too.
[00:23:49.240 --> 00:23:53.360]   In our day, I mean, if you have a church of 3,000 people,
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.400]   you're probably being shuttled around,
[00:23:55.400 --> 00:23:57.200]   you're being invited to guest speak,
[00:23:57.200 --> 00:23:58.960]   you're being invited to do reviews,
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:01.000]   and all this kind of awesome stuff.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.360]   But the book of Acts reminds us,
[00:24:04.360 --> 00:24:06.600]   when there is significant growth,
[00:24:06.600 --> 00:24:09.920]   when there is advancement of the gospel in the kingdom,
[00:24:09.920 --> 00:24:12.200]   typically it's not all peachy.
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:15.280]   But rather, there is intense persecution.
[00:24:15.720 --> 00:24:17.640]   And that's exactly what happens.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:20.160]   There is intense persecution such that
[00:24:20.160 --> 00:24:23.000]   it's quite profound, and we need to take a look.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:24.920]   Chapter four, verse six through seven.
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:30.040]   So, Apostle Peter preaches,
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:32.200]   and there's all these people coming to faith,
[00:24:32.200 --> 00:24:34.520]   and then there's people who are being healed,
[00:24:34.520 --> 00:24:35.960]   and the gospel is going out,
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:38.640]   and the next thing you know, in verse,
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:40.520]   well, let me just start if I read from verse six,
[00:24:40.520 --> 00:24:41.360]   forgive the context,
[00:24:41.360 --> 00:24:43.960]   but many of those who had heard the message believed.
[00:24:43.960 --> 00:24:47.280]   And the number of men came to be about 5,000.
[00:24:47.280 --> 00:24:50.360]   On the next day, their rulers and elders, scribes,
[00:24:50.360 --> 00:24:52.320]   were gathered together in Jerusalem.
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.160]   And Annas and the high priest was there,
[00:24:54.160 --> 00:24:56.240]   and Caiaphas and John and Alexander,
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:59.200]   and all who were of high priestly descent.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:00.800]   When they placed them in the center,
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:02.320]   they began to inquire,
[00:25:02.320 --> 00:25:06.240]   by what power or what name have you done this?
[00:25:06.240 --> 00:25:07.800]   Okay?
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:10.760]   So, what we have here is what I like to call
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:12.160]   organized crime.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:17.680]   These high priests aren't supposed to be together like this,
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.840]   but Annas, who is like, you can think,
[00:25:19.840 --> 00:25:21.560]   grandfather high priest,
[00:25:21.560 --> 00:25:24.000]   and then his sons, Caiaphas and so forth,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:26.200]   are high priests, is that lineage.
[00:25:26.200 --> 00:25:29.480]   He still has reigns, he can't let go.
[00:25:29.480 --> 00:25:30.320]   Okay?
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:31.600]   So, he gathered these people,
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.240]   and you notice how it says,
[00:25:33.240 --> 00:25:37.880]   the scribes and the elders and the rulers,
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:39.720]   and they all joined together.
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:42.360]   This is organized crime.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:44.920]   People who wouldn't even normally get together,
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:46.040]   were getting together.
[00:25:46.040 --> 00:25:47.800]   It'd be like, in our day,
[00:25:47.800 --> 00:25:50.920]   Republicans, all conservative and stuff,
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:52.680]   and then, you know, the liberals,
[00:25:52.680 --> 00:25:54.160]   or maybe Democrats or whatnot,
[00:25:54.160 --> 00:25:55.360]   joining together and saying,
[00:25:55.360 --> 00:25:57.840]   we've got a problem, let's knock this out.
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:00.560]   So, for the time being, joint effort.
[00:26:00.560 --> 00:26:01.800]   That's what you have.
[00:26:01.800 --> 00:26:03.640]   And the persecution is quite intense,
[00:26:03.640 --> 00:26:05.320]   because it's not simply that,
[00:26:05.320 --> 00:26:07.280]   they're just interrogating them.
[00:26:07.280 --> 00:26:10.440]   You know that these people are going to arrest,
[00:26:10.440 --> 00:26:12.200]   they're going to beat,
[00:26:12.200 --> 00:26:14.280]   they're going to shame publicly.
[00:26:14.280 --> 00:26:16.760]   This is quite intense persecution.
[00:26:16.760 --> 00:26:19.920]   But how does Apostle Peter react to this?
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.040]   Verse 11 and 12.
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:26.320]   He is the stone which was rejected by you,
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.360]   the builders, but which became the chief cornerstone.
[00:26:29.360 --> 00:26:31.960]   And there is salvation in no one else.
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:33.440]   There is no other name under heaven
[00:26:33.440 --> 00:26:34.840]   that has been given among men,
[00:26:34.840 --> 00:26:37.480]   by which we must be saved.
[00:26:37.480 --> 00:26:38.320]   Amen.
[00:26:38.320 --> 00:26:41.000]   That's awesome.
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:43.120]   And if you don't catch what he's saying,
[00:26:43.120 --> 00:26:45.200]   he's looking at religious leaders
[00:26:45.200 --> 00:26:47.680]   who believe they literally are the way to God.
[00:26:47.680 --> 00:26:48.960]   High priests are what?
[00:26:48.960 --> 00:26:51.400]   Intermediaries between man and God.
[00:26:51.400 --> 00:26:54.000]   So, if you don't see what's profound
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:56.080]   about what he's saying, that's so bold.
[00:26:56.080 --> 00:27:00.080]   In front of the face of the religious leaders and scribes,
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:01.840]   there is salvation in no one else.
[00:27:01.840 --> 00:27:04.200]   You all don't even know God.
[00:27:04.200 --> 00:27:06.440]   Only in the name of Christ.
[00:27:06.440 --> 00:27:07.920]   Wow.
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:09.200]   That is such confidence,
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:12.760]   that was such boldness amongst the apostles.
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:16.760]   But the point that I'm making here
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:20.200]   is the fact that Apostle Peter is persistent.
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:21.920]   Because in the face of this persecution,
[00:27:21.920 --> 00:27:24.040]   take a look at this in verse 19.
[00:27:24.040 --> 00:27:32.240]   So, the Pharisees, the scribes, the high priests,
[00:27:32.240 --> 00:27:35.480]   they're going to command him now, knock it off.
[00:27:35.480 --> 00:27:36.700]   You keep doing this, we're gonna hurt you,
[00:27:36.700 --> 00:27:38.200]   that kind of stuff.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:40.000]   But take a look at this in verse 19.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:54.240]   Amen.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:56.920]   Amen.
[00:27:56.920 --> 00:28:00.120]   Brothers and sisters,
[00:28:00.120 --> 00:28:02.280]   Christ has given us a grand purpose.
[00:28:02.280 --> 00:28:03.960]   You are all, every single one of you,
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:06.120]   although you are not in full vocation,
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:09.040]   a pastor, a missionary, or a Christian educator,
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:13.400]   whatever it may be, you have been called to be a witness.
[00:28:13.400 --> 00:28:15.240]   Every single one of us.
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:19.560]   We have been called to take a testimony and give it boldly.
[00:28:19.560 --> 00:28:22.720]   And I pray that every single person in our church
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:24.400]   would have this conviction.
[00:28:24.400 --> 00:28:28.560]   To be steadfast.
[00:28:28.560 --> 00:28:31.720]   To, in the face of persecution, to persist and say,
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.640]   I can't stop.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:37.320]   And I pray for myself that as a pastor,
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.080]   I pray that this would be my heart.
[00:28:39.080 --> 00:28:43.720]   There is sometimes fear in me, you guys.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.040]   Let me confess this to you.
[00:28:45.040 --> 00:28:47.400]   When I was at, you know, when I worked regular jobs
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.000]   and I'm like, okay, like I wanna share the gospel,
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:51.920]   I took him out to lunch, I wanna say something,
[00:28:51.920 --> 00:28:55.440]   but I don't know what to say 'cause it'd get awkward.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.880]   There's fear.
[00:28:56.880 --> 00:28:59.200]   There's fear over my boss, the situation.
[00:28:59.200 --> 00:29:01.480]   In your classrooms, there's fear.
[00:29:01.480 --> 00:29:03.920]   Can I remind you, there's fear here.
[00:29:03.920 --> 00:29:04.760]   Why?
[00:29:04.760 --> 00:29:06.720]   Because these guys are murderers.
[00:29:06.720 --> 00:29:10.160]   And as chairman, these are names written in the gospels
[00:29:10.160 --> 00:29:12.880]   because these are the ones who murdered Jesus Christ.
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:15.200]   So essentially, Apostle Peter is looking at these guys
[00:29:15.200 --> 00:29:17.000]   knowing these guys can kill me.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:18.600]   It's as though they have a gun.
[00:29:18.600 --> 00:29:22.120]   But in the face of that, they're bold.
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:24.080]   I can't stop preaching.
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:27.040]   We can't stop.
[00:29:27.040 --> 00:29:27.880]   Why?
[00:29:27.880 --> 00:29:30.520]   They're committed to obeying their master.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:33.680]   They saw the master's purpose, they know where they fit,
[00:29:33.680 --> 00:29:36.520]   they are committed, they bought into the program,
[00:29:36.520 --> 00:29:38.880]   they can't stop preaching the good news.
[00:29:38.880 --> 00:29:41.600]   And that's something for us to learn.
[00:29:41.600 --> 00:29:46.400]   If you take a look, chapter four, verse 27, 28,
[00:29:46.400 --> 00:29:47.520]   this continues.
[00:29:47.520 --> 00:29:53.480]   Chapter four, verse 27 through 30,
[00:29:53.480 --> 00:29:57.200]   I'm gonna read a little bit more longer here, okay.
[00:29:57.200 --> 00:30:02.040]   So, they were persecuted, the apostles are released,
[00:30:02.040 --> 00:30:04.600]   they go back to their brothers and sisters to reconvene
[00:30:04.600 --> 00:30:06.840]   and to regroup and to gain strength.
[00:30:06.840 --> 00:30:08.680]   And then this is what Apostle Peter said.
[00:30:08.680 --> 00:30:11.160]   For truly in this city they were gathered together
[00:30:11.160 --> 00:30:14.720]   against your holy servants, Jesus, whom you anointed,
[00:30:14.720 --> 00:30:17.200]   both Herod and Pontius Pilate, along with the Gentiles
[00:30:17.200 --> 00:30:18.560]   and the peoples of Israel.
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:21.240]   You notice he's connecting what's happening with them
[00:30:21.240 --> 00:30:24.400]   to what's happening with Jesus, okay.
[00:30:24.400 --> 00:30:27.560]   Verse 28, to do whatever your hand and your purpose
[00:30:27.560 --> 00:30:29.880]   destined to occur, there's our thought again.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.360]   This is what God has been doing.
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:34.520]   This is what you've purposed, let it be.
[00:30:34.520 --> 00:30:36.200]   And then he continues, verse 29.
[00:30:36.200 --> 00:30:38.920]   And now, Lord, take note of their threats and grant to
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.280]   that your bondservants may speak your word with confidence
[00:30:42.280 --> 00:30:44.760]   while you extend your hand to heal and the signs
[00:30:44.760 --> 00:30:47.560]   and wonders take place in the name of your holy servant,
[00:30:47.560 --> 00:30:50.200]   Jesus, and when they prayed, the place where they had
[00:30:50.200 --> 00:30:52.240]   gathered together was shaken.
[00:30:52.240 --> 00:30:54.280]   And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:30:54.280 --> 00:30:57.880]   and began to speak the word of God with boldness.
[00:30:58.960 --> 00:31:03.640]   That's so amazing to see that, what it means to be filled
[00:31:03.640 --> 00:31:08.640]   with the Spirit in this context, in light of the persecution,
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:13.640]   the injustice, the ridicule, the questioning,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:17.600]   that their response was greater boldness.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:20.040]   They prayed, God, we knew this was gonna happen.
[00:31:20.040 --> 00:31:22.240]   We knew the expectation, let's go.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:25.180]   And when they were filled with this Holy Spirit,
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:28.760]   they preached with even greater confidence.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.680]   But you know what?
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:31.880]   The story continues even further.
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.280]   Chapter five, the church has great fruit.
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.600]   There's people sacrificing and the church gets together
[00:31:36.600 --> 00:31:37.840]   and they're harmonious.
[00:31:37.840 --> 00:31:41.480]   But also, the apostles deal with sin in the church.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:45.600]   Ananias and Sapphira, being all prideful and using it
[00:31:45.600 --> 00:31:48.040]   in an opportunity to elevate themselves.
[00:31:48.040 --> 00:31:49.420]   They deal with all this stuff.
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:51.480]   But in the end, they're still healing,
[00:31:51.480 --> 00:31:53.480]   they're still preaching, they're still being bold,
[00:31:53.480 --> 00:31:56.800]   and now even more and more people come to the Lord.
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.100]   Take a look at chapter five, verse 17.
[00:31:59.100 --> 00:32:02.240]   What happens is, the people who are in power
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:05.120]   become even more jealous.
[00:32:05.120 --> 00:32:08.840]   Now they become violent, now they become incredibly,
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:13.120]   their animosity just grows more and more.
[00:32:13.120 --> 00:32:15.760]   And so verse 17 says, but the high priest rose up
[00:32:15.760 --> 00:32:19.040]   along with the associates, that is a sect of the Sadducees.
[00:32:19.040 --> 00:32:21.640]   You know the Sadducees, they were like politically
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:23.480]   completely on the far end.
[00:32:23.480 --> 00:32:25.360]   They didn't believe in parts of the Old Testament,
[00:32:25.360 --> 00:32:26.840]   they didn't believe in the resurrection,
[00:32:26.840 --> 00:32:29.080]   they were so far from the religious leaders.
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:30.480]   But here they are in their jealousy,
[00:32:30.480 --> 00:32:33.160]   getting together to fight the apostles.
[00:32:33.160 --> 00:32:35.880]   Verse 18, they laid hands on the apostles,
[00:32:35.880 --> 00:32:37.080]   put them into jail.
[00:32:37.080 --> 00:32:39.320]   They arrested them.
[00:32:39.320 --> 00:32:43.320]   They had a APB out on them, they caught them,
[00:32:43.320 --> 00:32:47.000]   brought them in, and then they started to
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:49.480]   really put a heavy hand on them.
[00:32:49.480 --> 00:32:51.960]   But then, the way that they respond to me again
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:56.080]   shows and reveals what I believe to be
[00:32:56.080 --> 00:32:58.680]   a true servant's heart.
[00:32:58.680 --> 00:33:03.160]   Verse 28, in verse 28, this is what it says.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.840]   I'll start from 27 actually.
[00:33:04.840 --> 00:33:06.640]   When they had brought them, they stood them
[00:33:06.640 --> 00:33:09.160]   before the council, and the high priest questioned them,
[00:33:09.160 --> 00:33:12.080]   saying, we gave you strict orders not to continue
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.720]   teaching in his name, and yet you have filled
[00:33:14.720 --> 00:33:17.320]   Jerusalem with your teaching, and intend to bring
[00:33:17.320 --> 00:33:20.280]   this man's blood upon us.
[00:33:20.280 --> 00:33:21.800]   Oh my goodness, how hypocritical.
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:22.920]   I would have just lost it.
[00:33:22.920 --> 00:33:23.760]   What?
[00:33:23.760 --> 00:33:25.520]   You know?
[00:33:25.520 --> 00:33:28.400]   Because if you remember, these guys were the ones
[00:33:28.400 --> 00:33:30.880]   who were egging for Christ's crucifixion,
[00:33:30.880 --> 00:33:33.400]   and when Pontius Pilate said, I don't see any fall
[00:33:33.400 --> 00:33:35.400]   in the sky, washed his hands and said,
[00:33:35.400 --> 00:33:38.160]   you know what, I am clear of this man's blood.
[00:33:38.160 --> 00:33:39.640]   Do you know what they said?
[00:33:39.640 --> 00:33:43.940]   Let his blood be on us, on us and our children.
[00:33:43.940 --> 00:33:45.600]   We want him dead, that's what they said,
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.400]   and here he is, like, look at what you're doing,
[00:33:47.400 --> 00:33:49.000]   you're putting the blood on us.
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:50.560]   Oh my goodness.
[00:33:50.560 --> 00:33:52.560]   But then, look at the response, verse 29.
[00:33:52.560 --> 00:33:55.980]   But Peter and the apostles answered,
[00:33:55.980 --> 00:33:59.640]   we must obey God rather than men.
[00:33:59.640 --> 00:34:01.600]   The God of our fathers raised up Jesus,
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.720]   whom you had put to death by hanging him on a cross.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.560]   He is the one whom God exalted to the right hand
[00:34:07.560 --> 00:34:11.000]   as a prince and a savior to grant repentance to Israel
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:12.280]   and forgiveness of sins.
[00:34:12.280 --> 00:34:14.760]   Here he is again, taking this opportunity.
[00:34:14.760 --> 00:34:16.560]   He's not defending himself.
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.960]   He is persistent in doing the will of God.
[00:34:20.960 --> 00:34:23.600]   That's the servant's heart.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.840]   I must obey God, I can do no other.
[00:34:26.840 --> 00:34:28.320]   I can't stop.
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:30.800]   What a heart.
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:32.440]   What dedication.
[00:34:32.440 --> 00:34:33.960]   What commitment.
[00:34:33.960 --> 00:34:35.340]   Why do I say that?
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:38.760]   Because when I'm afraid, I hide.
[00:34:38.760 --> 00:34:40.960]   I run, I dodge.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:44.040]   When I'm hurt, my defenses go automatically up.
[00:34:45.160 --> 00:34:47.880]   I want to defend myself,
[00:34:47.880 --> 00:34:50.380]   and I'm willing sometimes to accuse other people.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:53.680]   But look at the boldness and the confidence
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:58.840]   of him not being arrogant, but him being humble,
[00:34:58.840 --> 00:35:00.840]   and so having this kind of dedication.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:05.320]   I believe this really does come with a perception,
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:08.200]   a perspective of God as sovereign,
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:10.440]   authoritative master over all,
[00:35:10.440 --> 00:35:12.420]   even the master of these wicked men.
[00:35:13.720 --> 00:35:15.440]   Do you know that in the Bible,
[00:35:15.440 --> 00:35:18.080]   in Proverbs chapter 28, verse one,
[00:35:18.080 --> 00:35:21.520]   it says that the righteous of God are as bold as lions?
[00:35:21.520 --> 00:35:24.200]   Proverbs 28, verse one.
[00:35:24.200 --> 00:35:26.920]   The righteous of God are as bold as lions.
[00:35:26.920 --> 00:35:29.520]   I want you to think about that for a moment.
[00:35:29.520 --> 00:35:32.960]   Does that seem arrogant for us to be like bold as lions?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.040]   To us have our like manes all fluffed
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.060]   and walk around like kings?
[00:35:37.060 --> 00:35:41.000]   But the fact of the matter is the scripture analogously
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:45.040]   describes those who are in God as bold as lions.
[00:35:45.040 --> 00:35:47.740]   You know, lions have no natural predator.
[00:35:47.740 --> 00:35:50.460]   That's why when you go to the zoo,
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.280]   they're just like lazy bums lying everywhere.
[00:35:53.280 --> 00:35:55.080]   Other animals, you come over to their cage,
[00:35:55.080 --> 00:35:57.000]   they run, they hide, you know,
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:58.680]   because they're all afraid.
[00:35:58.680 --> 00:36:00.440]   Lions, they kind of look at you,
[00:36:00.440 --> 00:36:02.840]   and they just slump, and then they just like sleep.
[00:36:02.840 --> 00:36:05.100]   And you want them to do something, but they won't.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:05.940]   Why?
[00:36:05.940 --> 00:36:07.000]   They're afraid of nobody.
[00:36:07.000 --> 00:36:08.160]   They have no predators.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.200]   Do you realize that the scriptures
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:14.680]   challenges us to have that kind of heart
[00:36:14.680 --> 00:36:16.280]   that's not an arrogant one?
[00:36:16.280 --> 00:36:19.640]   It's a humble boldness that comes from the servant's heart,
[00:36:19.640 --> 00:36:22.420]   seeing his master's sovereignty.
[00:36:22.420 --> 00:36:23.880]   Do you remember in Romans chapter eight?
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:26.040]   We have to turn there and look at this passage.
[00:36:26.040 --> 00:36:28.040]   Do you remember in Romans chapter eight,
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:30.760]   verse 31 and forward?
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:33.340]   Verse 31 and forward.
[00:36:33.340 --> 00:36:39.880]   If God is for us, who can be against us?
[00:36:40.640 --> 00:36:42.680]   He who did not spare his own son,
[00:36:42.680 --> 00:36:44.920]   but gave him up for us all,
[00:36:44.920 --> 00:36:49.080]   how will he not also with him graciously give us all things?
[00:36:49.080 --> 00:36:51.720]   Who shall bring any charge against the elect?
[00:36:51.720 --> 00:36:54.000]   It is God who justifies.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:55.640]   Who is to condemn?
[00:36:55.640 --> 00:36:57.040]   These priests?
[00:36:57.040 --> 00:36:59.040]   These scribes?
[00:36:59.040 --> 00:37:00.820]   Christ Jesus is the one who died.
[00:37:00.820 --> 00:37:02.240]   More than that, who was raised,
[00:37:02.240 --> 00:37:03.840]   who is at the right hand of God,
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:06.840]   who indeed is interceding for us.
[00:37:06.840 --> 00:37:08.640]   Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:11.120]   Shall tribulation or distress or persecution
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:14.440]   or famine or nakedness or danger or sword?
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:15.280]   Nothing.
[00:37:15.280 --> 00:37:20.440]   What is such a huge danger for the Christian who has God?
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:21.520]   Nothing.
[00:37:21.520 --> 00:37:24.680]   So we have courage.
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.080]   We have boldness.
[00:37:26.080 --> 00:37:27.680]   We have confidence.
[00:37:27.680 --> 00:37:28.900]   I can preach.
[00:37:28.900 --> 00:37:29.920]   I can minister.
[00:37:29.920 --> 00:37:31.600]   I can go.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:32.880]   I can be hurt.
[00:37:32.880 --> 00:37:35.160]   But I'm not in danger.
[00:37:35.160 --> 00:37:37.960]   This is the heart of Apostle Peter
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:40.880]   and the other disciples getting persecuted.
[00:37:40.880 --> 00:37:43.760]   We must, we have a sovereign God.
[00:37:43.760 --> 00:37:46.800]   And so what we see so far is that the Apostle Peter
[00:37:46.800 --> 00:37:49.880]   had the servant's heart to see the purpose of God.
[00:37:49.880 --> 00:37:52.080]   We also see that he has a servant's heart to say,
[00:37:52.080 --> 00:37:55.960]   if I see the purpose of this sovereign God, I obey.
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:57.040]   I must obey.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:37:58.560]   I can't stop.
[00:37:58.560 --> 00:37:59.680]   Right?
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:02.280]   But lastly, he has this perspective
[00:38:02.280 --> 00:38:04.760]   of the servant's privilege.
[00:38:04.760 --> 00:38:06.640]   Of the servant's privilege.
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:08.680]   And this is the most profound one of all.
[00:38:08.680 --> 00:38:10.520]   This is actually the reason why I'm preaching
[00:38:10.520 --> 00:38:11.780]   from the book of Acts 3 this morning,
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.920]   because as I study this passage,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:18.280]   it was so convicting, humbling, challenging,
[00:38:18.280 --> 00:38:19.760]   I just had to stop.
[00:38:19.760 --> 00:38:22.220]   And I've been dwelling on this for weeks.
[00:38:22.220 --> 00:38:26.480]   To have a servant's heart like Apostle Peter,
[00:38:26.480 --> 00:38:30.240]   to see what he's going through as a privilege.
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:34.520]   Take a look at Acts chapter five, verse 40 through 42.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.960]   Acts chapter five, verse 40 through 42.
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:42.120]   And as you go there, I'm gonna give you the background.
[00:38:42.120 --> 00:38:43.820]   The background is this.
[00:38:43.820 --> 00:38:46.960]   The priests, the high priests, the scribes, the Sadducees,
[00:38:46.960 --> 00:38:49.900]   all this council of the wise men of Israel,
[00:38:49.900 --> 00:38:52.640]   gathering together against the apostles of God.
[00:38:52.640 --> 00:38:55.280]   They don't know what to do.
[00:38:55.280 --> 00:38:57.320]   Okay, we just threatened these guys.
[00:38:57.320 --> 00:38:59.320]   We put them in jail, and they just looked at us
[00:38:59.320 --> 00:39:00.560]   and said, we can't stop.
[00:39:00.560 --> 00:39:03.120]   We're not gonna obey you.
[00:39:03.120 --> 00:39:07.560]   Ah, these rebellious insubordinates.
[00:39:07.560 --> 00:39:08.400]   What do we do?
[00:39:08.400 --> 00:39:09.720]   One guy says, kill 'em.
[00:39:09.720 --> 00:39:12.220]   Let's just kill 'em.
[00:39:12.220 --> 00:39:16.480]   But then there's a rabbi, his name is Gamaliel, okay?
[00:39:16.480 --> 00:39:18.000]   His name might be familiar.
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.480]   Apostle Paul studied under this one guy.
[00:39:20.480 --> 00:39:24.320]   He was known to be one of the greatest rabbis,
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:26.960]   not of their generation, but of all generations.
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:29.600]   He was such a profound thinker.
[00:39:29.600 --> 00:39:33.160]   He was such a profound writer and scribe
[00:39:33.160 --> 00:39:35.000]   that they even gave him a special name.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:38.800]   It wasn't just, hey, rabbi, it was rabban, okay?
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:40.320]   So if you guys are into the comics and stuff,
[00:39:40.320 --> 00:39:42.600]   it's like Super Saiyan, you know?
[00:39:42.600 --> 00:39:44.960]   (audience laughs)
[00:39:44.960 --> 00:39:48.140]   So the whole idea is this guy is above,
[00:39:48.140 --> 00:39:50.480]   head above the rest of the rabbis.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:54.560]   And he says, hey, if this is something of men,
[00:39:54.560 --> 00:39:55.600]   it's just gonna pass.
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:58.860]   Remember those peevish people, Thaddeus and the rebellion,
[00:39:58.860 --> 00:40:01.120]   the 400 people rebelled?
[00:40:01.120 --> 00:40:02.160]   What happened to that?
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:05.160]   Nothing, give it time, it'll just fizzle.
[00:40:05.160 --> 00:40:07.560]   So with this too, take a look.
[00:40:07.560 --> 00:40:11.040]   This is what he says in verse 38 through 39.
[00:40:11.040 --> 00:40:13.360]   So in the present case, I say to you,
[00:40:13.360 --> 00:40:16.160]   stay away from these men and let them alone.
[00:40:16.160 --> 00:40:18.720]   For if this plan or action is of men,
[00:40:18.720 --> 00:40:20.760]   it will be overthrown.
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:24.440]   But if it is of God, you will not be able to overthrow him.
[00:40:24.440 --> 00:40:28.120]   Or else you may even be found fighting against God.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.380]   You can see why people are thinking,
[00:40:29.380 --> 00:40:32.960]   whoa, this guy is wise, right?
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:34.920]   But the thing about it is,
[00:40:34.920 --> 00:40:37.360]   if you take a closer look at what's going on,
[00:40:37.360 --> 00:40:41.000]   Gamaliel's counsel is not wise.
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:42.560]   It's not godly.
[00:40:42.560 --> 00:40:44.720]   It's not in favor of the disciples.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:47.640]   It is simply pragmatic.
[00:40:47.640 --> 00:40:50.320]   These guys have a big clout right now.
[00:40:50.320 --> 00:40:52.320]   Basically, 3,000 people came to faith,
[00:40:52.320 --> 00:40:53.720]   5,000 people came to faith,
[00:40:53.720 --> 00:40:55.160]   there's more being added daily.
[00:40:55.160 --> 00:40:56.760]   They have a huge following.
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:41:00.040]   You go against them, you go against 10,000.
[00:41:00.040 --> 00:41:02.120]   So give it some time, let it blow off.
[00:41:02.120 --> 00:41:03.920]   Is that godly?
[00:41:03.920 --> 00:41:04.760]   No.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:06.800]   Apostle Peter is making a claim,
[00:41:06.800 --> 00:41:09.600]   Jesus Christ is the stone, he is the salvation,
[00:41:09.600 --> 00:41:12.640]   he is essentially God.
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:14.840]   And you Pharisees need to submit.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:16.760]   That's basically what he's saying.
[00:41:16.760 --> 00:41:19.160]   And for Gamaliel to say, eh, we'll just give it time,
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:20.680]   that is not godly.
[00:41:20.680 --> 00:41:22.400]   Not godly at all.
[00:41:22.400 --> 00:41:24.440]   And what's not godly is what happens next.
[00:41:24.440 --> 00:41:27.880]   So, verse 40, they took his advice,
[00:41:27.880 --> 00:41:29.480]   and after calling the apostles in,
[00:41:29.480 --> 00:41:31.040]   they flogged them and ordered them
[00:41:31.040 --> 00:41:32.800]   not to speak in the name of Jesus,
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.200]   and then released him.
[00:41:34.200 --> 00:41:38.040]   And then released him.
[00:41:38.040 --> 00:41:40.600]   But then this next part is the killer,
[00:41:40.600 --> 00:41:43.560]   is the part that I want you guys to highlight,
[00:41:43.560 --> 00:41:48.200]   underline, star, bracket, everything, okay?
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:50.720]   Look at what this says.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:53.840]   So they went on their way from the presence of the council,
[00:41:53.840 --> 00:41:56.640]   rejoicing that they had been considered worthy
[00:41:56.640 --> 00:41:59.800]   to suffer shame for his name.
[00:41:59.800 --> 00:42:02.240]   And every day in the temple and from house to house,
[00:42:02.240 --> 00:42:03.760]   they kept right on preaching,
[00:42:03.760 --> 00:42:06.560]   and preaching Jesus as the Christ.
[00:42:06.560 --> 00:42:07.960]   Amen.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:09.080]   You see their persistence,
[00:42:09.080 --> 00:42:11.680]   you see their submission to the purposes of God,
[00:42:11.680 --> 00:42:13.920]   but one of the things that's highlighted in this passage
[00:42:13.920 --> 00:42:16.880]   is you see their perspective on life.
[00:42:19.280 --> 00:42:24.280]   They view all that they experienced as a privilege.
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.280]   Would you have thought it like that?
[00:42:26.280 --> 00:42:29.440]   I mean, essentially, he's been preaching,
[00:42:29.440 --> 00:42:30.760]   he's been going out of his way,
[00:42:30.760 --> 00:42:32.640]   these apostles still are,
[00:42:32.640 --> 00:42:34.560]   essentially, like, they don't have possessions of their own,
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:36.760]   they didn't take along the wife and et cetera.
[00:42:36.760 --> 00:42:39.520]   They've given and sacrificed everything.
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:41.360]   So now, to have poured out everything,
[00:42:41.360 --> 00:42:43.720]   only to conclude in,
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.520]   we just got spanked by the politicians.
[00:42:46.520 --> 00:42:50.640]   We just got beat up and flogged by the religious leaders.
[00:42:50.640 --> 00:42:52.120]   What happened?
[00:42:52.120 --> 00:42:54.360]   That's what I would have said.
[00:42:54.360 --> 00:42:56.760]   I would have been very disappointed.
[00:42:56.760 --> 00:43:01.760]   Aw, I was hoping this would turn out well, you know?
[00:43:01.760 --> 00:43:04.200]   I thought we had a big church growing.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:06.720]   Very disappointed.
[00:43:06.720 --> 00:43:07.800]   Obviously, more than disappointed,
[00:43:07.800 --> 00:43:09.760]   I would have been bitter in my heart, like,
[00:43:09.760 --> 00:43:11.720]   what, what's going on, you know?
[00:43:11.720 --> 00:43:14.240]   After giving my heart, after preaching,
[00:43:14.240 --> 00:43:16.480]   after doing all this, this is what I get?
[00:43:16.480 --> 00:43:18.520]   If you've ever had thoughts like that,
[00:43:18.520 --> 00:43:21.440]   after giving of myself and devoting and giving,
[00:43:21.440 --> 00:43:23.440]   no one's reciprocating, no one's helping,
[00:43:23.440 --> 00:43:24.680]   and this is what I get?
[00:43:24.680 --> 00:43:27.520]   You'd be embittered.
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:29.000]   You'd be embittered, perhaps,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:31.400]   at all the people who are hurting you,
[00:43:31.400 --> 00:43:34.160]   and worst and foremost, you'd probably be bitter at God.
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.280]   God, what gives?
[00:43:35.280 --> 00:43:37.920]   Am I not serving your purpose?
[00:43:37.920 --> 00:43:39.920]   Am I not doing what you asked me to do?
[00:43:39.920 --> 00:43:42.480]   And this is what I get?
[00:43:42.480 --> 00:43:45.440]   But that wasn't the heart of the apostles at all,
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:46.640]   wasn't it?
[00:43:46.640 --> 00:43:51.200]   It was, thanks, God, for giving me this opportunity.
[00:43:51.200 --> 00:43:52.040]   Thank you.
[00:43:52.040 --> 00:43:54.120]   Who thinks like that?
[00:43:54.120 --> 00:43:58.040]   Does that not strike you as strange?
[00:43:58.040 --> 00:44:01.400]   Almost not human?
[00:44:01.400 --> 00:44:05.400]   Am I the only one sitting here thinking,
[00:44:05.400 --> 00:44:07.200]   I don't know if I can do that?
[00:44:07.200 --> 00:44:10.640]   Who really thinks like that?
[00:44:10.640 --> 00:44:12.920]   And then as I thought and thought and meditated on it,
[00:44:12.920 --> 00:44:16.400]   I realized we do think like that.
[00:44:16.400 --> 00:44:18.840]   In different scenarios, different life circumstances,
[00:44:18.840 --> 00:44:21.160]   we all think like that to some degree.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:25.200]   I can give an example, perhaps, of a young man.
[00:44:25.200 --> 00:44:29.440]   He has this beautiful girl he's chasing.
[00:44:29.440 --> 00:44:30.880]   He's trying to woo her.
[00:44:30.880 --> 00:44:32.920]   He's being super nice and courteous,
[00:44:32.920 --> 00:44:34.720]   chivalrous, opens the door,
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:38.280]   pulls out the seat,
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:42.240]   and he'd be willing if he keeps going down that path,
[00:44:42.240 --> 00:44:43.760]   holds her purse.
[00:44:43.760 --> 00:44:45.480]   I got to hold her purse.
[00:44:45.480 --> 00:44:48.120]   It's like, that's friend zone, man.
[00:44:48.120 --> 00:44:52.560]   But in his mind, it's like, I got to give her a ride.
[00:44:52.560 --> 00:44:54.000]   I got to.
[00:44:54.000 --> 00:44:57.600]   But in his friend's eyes, it's like, you got used.
[00:44:57.600 --> 00:45:00.360]   But in his mind, it's not a sacrifice, is it?
[00:45:00.360 --> 00:45:02.720]   You know, there was a time when I was in seminary.
[00:45:02.720 --> 00:45:06.200]   My seminary was on the Grace Community Church campus.
[00:45:06.200 --> 00:45:09.440]   We were at masters, they share campuses.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:11.560]   And John MacArthur walks around a lot,
[00:45:11.560 --> 00:45:13.760]   and sometimes he asks seminary students
[00:45:13.760 --> 00:45:15.080]   to help him with stuff.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:17.280]   And MacArthur's just a man.
[00:45:17.280 --> 00:45:18.880]   He's just a dude, you know?
[00:45:18.880 --> 00:45:20.720]   And now he's an aging man.
[00:45:20.720 --> 00:45:22.040]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:45:22.040 --> 00:45:25.760]   in certain circles, he's seen as like, wow.
[00:45:25.760 --> 00:45:27.200]   He's got a halo going around him.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   And I remember when one of my buddies,
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.800]   he was asked, like, can you give me a ride?
[00:45:31.800 --> 00:45:34.120]   John MacArthur, we were walking by,
[00:45:34.120 --> 00:45:35.120]   he said, can you give me a ride?
[00:45:35.120 --> 00:45:37.560]   I need to go right now to the speaking engagement.
[00:45:37.560 --> 00:45:39.720]   You get to just come to the engagement and listen.
[00:45:39.720 --> 00:45:42.320]   So they booked it, they hit traffic together,
[00:45:42.320 --> 00:45:44.520]   and then they went to the venue, they came back,
[00:45:44.520 --> 00:45:46.040]   and the next day when we had class,
[00:45:46.040 --> 00:45:50.280]   this guy was just like, you know, he's just like crazy.
[00:45:50.280 --> 00:45:53.040]   He's like, I got to be in traffic with MacArthur.
[00:45:53.040 --> 00:45:55.800]   And the rest of us are sitting here thinking like,
[00:45:55.800 --> 00:45:56.640]   you dweeb.
[00:45:56.640 --> 00:45:58.680]   But then in the back of my mind,
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:01.280]   it's like, so cool, you know?
[00:46:01.280 --> 00:46:03.600]   Why, why is that?
[00:46:03.600 --> 00:46:07.720]   The person you honor, you adore, you serve,
[00:46:07.720 --> 00:46:09.000]   it's not a sacrifice.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:15.240]   Anything, just anything feels good to do for you.
[00:46:15.240 --> 00:46:18.120]   Why do grandparents just want to feed the baby?
[00:46:18.120 --> 00:46:20.800]   Like, they want an opportunity just to feed the baby, why?
[00:46:20.800 --> 00:46:22.400]   Feeding babies not fun.
[00:46:22.400 --> 00:46:24.720]   Food is everywhere, it's like they don't need it,
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:27.120]   you know, takes an hour, it's frustrating,
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:29.200]   it kills me, okay?
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:30.960]   But grandparents, I just want to come over
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.720]   and feed your baby.
[00:46:32.720 --> 00:46:34.880]   I just want your kid to sit on my lap.
[00:46:34.880 --> 00:46:37.160]   I just want your kid to just be by my side
[00:46:37.160 --> 00:46:38.840]   on hot days, it's like I don't want my kids
[00:46:38.840 --> 00:46:41.680]   anywhere near me, it's like, go home, sit on me, you know?
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.280]   But grandparents, they don't think twice.
[00:46:45.280 --> 00:46:49.160]   (audience laughing)
[00:46:49.160 --> 00:46:51.440]   I don't do that all the time, okay?
[00:46:51.440 --> 00:46:53.240]   Just sometimes when it's really hot.
[00:46:53.240 --> 00:47:01.280]   But discomfort, suffering,
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:06.040]   it's all worth it when you love that person, right?
[00:47:07.040 --> 00:47:08.640]   The fact of the matter is,
[00:47:08.640 --> 00:47:10.360]   Apostle Peter looks at God and says,
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.360]   "Thank you, you thought of me to give me this opportunity."
[00:47:13.360 --> 00:47:17.920]   And can I make this more profound?
[00:47:17.920 --> 00:47:21.680]   It's because flogging is not a small deal.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.760]   In the Mishnah, which is kind of like a commentary
[00:47:23.760 --> 00:47:26.680]   to the Bible of the Jewish religion,
[00:47:26.680 --> 00:47:29.240]   they write of flogging, that the individual
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   who is being flogged would be tied their hands
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:34.400]   to a post, basically like this, so that they'd be stretched.
[00:47:34.400 --> 00:47:36.200]   And what's more, they would have a pillar,
[00:47:36.200 --> 00:47:38.560]   a rock or a stone, pressed up against their chest
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:42.240]   so that they could not lean forward and dodge the whipping.
[00:47:42.240 --> 00:47:45.360]   And the story of it, as I read to it,
[00:47:45.360 --> 00:47:46.640]   I didn't realize it was that bad.
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:48.640]   In my mind, I just thought of the movies.
[00:47:48.640 --> 00:47:50.400]   (imitates whip cracking)
[00:47:50.400 --> 00:47:53.840]   And then next thing you know, they go down 40 times.
[00:47:53.840 --> 00:47:57.320]   A lot of times, they wouldn't go all 40
[00:47:57.320 --> 00:47:58.680]   because people would die.
[00:47:58.680 --> 00:48:01.880]   In the Mishnah, it writes of the whipping.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:03.040]   I'm not gonna go into every detail
[00:48:03.040 --> 00:48:04.640]   because it's too gruesome, but the whipping
[00:48:04.640 --> 00:48:06.280]   was not just on the back.
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:07.540]   It was everywhere.
[00:48:07.540 --> 00:48:08.760]   They would turn the guy around
[00:48:08.760 --> 00:48:10.660]   when the back was too bloody and bare.
[00:48:10.660 --> 00:48:16.400]   It blows my mind for a disciple of Christ
[00:48:16.400 --> 00:48:19.480]   to be like, thank you for giving me this opportunity
[00:48:19.480 --> 00:48:20.480]   to serve you.
[00:48:20.480 --> 00:48:23.640]   It strikes at my heart.
[00:48:23.640 --> 00:48:27.280]   Because perhaps the opportunities I want are glamorous.
[00:48:27.280 --> 00:48:30.040]   Because perhaps the opportunities I want are X, Y, and Z.
[00:48:30.040 --> 00:48:32.760]   But for them, anything, God, anything you ask me to do,
[00:48:32.760 --> 00:48:34.120]   I'd be happy to do it.
[00:48:34.120 --> 00:48:34.960]   Why?
[00:48:34.960 --> 00:48:36.640]   Because they have a servant's heart.
[00:48:36.640 --> 00:48:40.720]   And that's what I'm getting at with this sermon.
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:44.680]   As I read through the Acts of the Apostles,
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:47.480]   as I read through what God has been doing,
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:49.240]   I saw in them a servant's heart,
[00:48:49.240 --> 00:48:51.320]   a willingness to experience anything.
[00:48:51.320 --> 00:48:53.680]   And even shame for Christ, they desired it
[00:48:53.680 --> 00:48:55.360]   because they saw it as an honor
[00:48:55.360 --> 00:48:58.400]   to do something for my Lord.
[00:48:58.400 --> 00:49:01.280]   Because they bought into his purpose.
[00:49:01.280 --> 00:49:03.120]   Because they're dedicated to obey.
[00:49:03.120 --> 00:49:06.440]   Do we consider it our privilege?
[00:49:06.440 --> 00:49:08.500]   Brothers and sisters, are there any of us in here
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.120]   who perhaps have been serving,
[00:49:10.120 --> 00:49:13.880]   and perhaps we've said, this is not worth it.
[00:49:13.880 --> 00:49:14.860]   It's too much.
[00:49:14.860 --> 00:49:18.600]   This is not worth it for me to stress over so much.
[00:49:18.600 --> 00:49:20.320]   It's not worth it for me to invest this much time.
[00:49:20.320 --> 00:49:21.720]   This is not worth it for me to do this.
[00:49:21.720 --> 00:49:23.760]   Nobody's recognizing me.
[00:49:23.760 --> 00:49:25.400]   There's no appreciation.
[00:49:25.400 --> 00:49:27.520]   If I try, nobody's reciprocating.
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.760]   If I try, nobody's acknowledging.
[00:49:29.760 --> 00:49:30.920]   It's just not worth it.
[00:49:31.920 --> 00:49:34.880]   The challenge here today is,
[00:49:34.880 --> 00:49:37.480]   to such a degree, the Apostles saw it,
[00:49:37.480 --> 00:49:40.040]   and they said, this is so worth it.
[00:49:40.040 --> 00:49:41.920]   All of it, the shame, the ridicule,
[00:49:41.920 --> 00:49:44.400]   the questioning, the imprisonment, jail, flogging.
[00:49:44.400 --> 00:49:46.820]   So worth it.
[00:49:46.820 --> 00:49:47.880]   Why?
[00:49:47.880 --> 00:49:50.360]   Because they had a heart of servanthood
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:52.040]   towards their loving master.
[00:49:52.040 --> 00:49:55.480]   To their loving master.
[00:49:55.480 --> 00:49:58.000]   They thought, God thought of us
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:00.320]   worthy enough to bear this shame.
[00:50:00.320 --> 00:50:01.800]   Wow.
[00:50:01.800 --> 00:50:03.840]   That's a perspective.
[00:50:03.840 --> 00:50:05.760]   That's very challenging.
[00:50:05.760 --> 00:50:08.780]   There's a passage in 1 Peter 4.13
[00:50:08.780 --> 00:50:10.040]   that reads like this, "Dear friends,
[00:50:10.040 --> 00:50:12.360]   "do not be surprised at the painful trial
[00:50:12.360 --> 00:50:15.280]   "that you are suffering, as though something strange
[00:50:15.280 --> 00:50:16.520]   "were happening to you."
[00:50:16.520 --> 00:50:17.680]   Peter writes this.
[00:50:17.680 --> 00:50:19.620]   "But rejoice that you participate
[00:50:19.620 --> 00:50:21.320]   "in the sufferings of Christ."
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:22.960]   He writes this.
[00:50:22.960 --> 00:50:27.060]   "So that you may be overjoyed when his glory is revealed.
[00:50:27.060 --> 00:50:29.280]   "If you are insulted because of the name of Christ,
[00:50:29.280 --> 00:50:31.500]   "you are blessed, for the spirit of glory
[00:50:31.500 --> 00:50:33.220]   "and of God rests on you.
[00:50:33.220 --> 00:50:36.360]   "If you suffer, it should not be as a murderer,
[00:50:36.360 --> 00:50:37.720]   "a thief, or any kind of criminal,
[00:50:37.720 --> 00:50:38.600]   "or even as a meddler.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:40.820]   "However, if you suffer as a Christian,
[00:50:40.820 --> 00:50:42.240]   "do not be ashamed.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:45.800]   "Praise God that you bear his name."
[00:50:45.800 --> 00:50:49.360]   Apostle Peter, Apostle Paul,
[00:50:49.360 --> 00:50:52.160]   all these servants of God has a servant's heart.
[00:50:52.160 --> 00:50:53.160]   And it's such a challenging thing
[00:50:53.160 --> 00:50:55.960]   because they don't flippantly say,
[00:50:55.960 --> 00:50:58.440]   "It's a blessing to have the name of God on you."
[00:50:58.440 --> 00:51:01.540]   They show we bear the marks of Christ.
[00:51:01.540 --> 00:51:05.560]   It's a challenge to us today
[00:51:05.560 --> 00:51:09.080]   that we should just be thankful that God is using us.
[00:51:09.080 --> 00:51:11.160]   But we should also have a hard attitude.
[00:51:11.160 --> 00:51:15.680]   Lord, I don't have an agenda of my own.
[00:51:15.680 --> 00:51:18.200]   But to your glory, to your purpose, to your cause,
[00:51:18.200 --> 00:51:20.400]   I offer up myself.
[00:51:20.400 --> 00:51:21.680]   I surrender it all.
[00:51:21.680 --> 00:51:26.440]   And if you would have me be used for whatever purpose,
[00:51:26.440 --> 00:51:29.560]   I'm not higher than anything that you have.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.860]   But rather, God, it would be my good joy
[00:51:32.860 --> 00:51:35.680]   to serve you in any way that pleases you.
[00:51:35.680 --> 00:51:37.080]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:51:37.080 --> 00:51:41.880]   Father God, we again wanna thank you so much.
[00:51:41.880 --> 00:51:43.800]   You are the sovereign God.
[00:51:43.800 --> 00:51:45.960]   I believe Apostle Peter can trust you.
[00:51:45.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   I believe Apostle Peter can have this perspective
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:49.600]   because you are the sovereign God
[00:51:49.600 --> 00:51:52.620]   who was the same yesterday, today, and tomorrow.
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:55.640]   And so thank you, Lord, that you are the sovereign one
[00:51:55.640 --> 00:51:59.840]   who promises that God, if we serve, nothing is in vain.
[00:51:59.840 --> 00:52:02.080]   Who promises if we invest into church,
[00:52:02.080 --> 00:52:04.880]   if we invest into people, nothing is in vain.
[00:52:04.880 --> 00:52:05.720]   Why?
[00:52:05.720 --> 00:52:07.800]   Because your promises come to pass.
[00:52:07.800 --> 00:52:09.440]   Your purpose is sure.
[00:52:09.440 --> 00:52:14.260]   Everything will happen according and exactly as you say.
[00:52:14.260 --> 00:52:16.160]   God, I pray that each and every single one of us
[00:52:16.160 --> 00:52:19.320]   would have such trust in our master,
[00:52:19.320 --> 00:52:22.160]   that God, we would be humble servants.
[00:52:22.160 --> 00:52:24.480]   God, buying into your vision, your plan,
[00:52:24.480 --> 00:52:27.360]   never questioning, God, committing to your way
[00:52:27.360 --> 00:52:30.040]   and being faithful, and also simply having
[00:52:30.040 --> 00:52:33.280]   the humble heart, Lord, to see it as a privilege
[00:52:33.280 --> 00:52:35.960]   to serve your great glory.
[00:52:35.960 --> 00:52:37.080]   Father, we thank you again.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:38.120]   We lift you up on high.
[00:52:38.120 --> 00:52:40.460]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[00:52:40.460 --> 00:52:43.640]   (bike wheels rolling)
