[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.520]   As Easter is coming up, I wanted to take a few weeks to prepare us.
[00:00:10.520 --> 00:00:15.560]   Normally during the Easter, the Passion Week, we have Monday through Thursday, we have events
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:16.560]   that are going on.
[00:00:16.560 --> 00:00:21.120]   We kind of follow the outline of what Jesus went through during that week to prepare us
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:22.740]   for Good Friday.
[00:00:22.740 --> 00:00:28.600]   And then from Good Friday, we have Sunday morning where we want to take advantage of
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.680]   this year in particular.
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:35.720]   I think, as I've been mentioning, and I've been talking to other churches and their pastor,
[00:00:35.720 --> 00:00:40.540]   and I think we're all in agreement that the last couple years, that God has created an
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:44.160]   environment that we haven't seen in for a long time.
[00:00:44.160 --> 00:00:48.040]   Where there is, even in our church, there are people who are visiting a church who've
[00:00:48.040 --> 00:00:54.160]   never been to church before, never entered church, who are beginning to seek for answers
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:55.360]   of what's going on.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:00:59.240]   Because I think because of the pandemic, people have been kind of distraught, asking questions
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:00.980]   about is this it?
[00:01:00.980 --> 00:01:01.980]   Is there more to it?
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.680]   Or people who've fallen away in faith, went to church when they were young, wanting to
[00:01:05.680 --> 00:01:08.200]   get back right with God.
[00:01:08.200 --> 00:01:13.040]   And what's going on right now with the economic situation, with the war that's happening in
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.420]   Ukraine.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.740]   And so more people are thinking about deeper things than just having fun.
[00:01:19.740 --> 00:01:23.280]   And this is something that I think God has deliberately created for us.
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:28.920]   And so each Easter, we want to be deliberate and take that time to share the gospel, invite
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:32.120]   people to church that may normally not come to church.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:37.480]   But especially this year, we want to take this opportunity to not only prepare our hearts,
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:41.880]   that God would really use this to revive us and renew us if we've been hardened in any
[00:01:41.880 --> 00:01:44.360]   way or if we've been drifting in any way.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:49.080]   To take this time to really, like I'm going to commit this period to really focus our
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:51.200]   attention to be anchored in Christ.
[00:01:51.200 --> 00:01:56.360]   But along with that, to take advantage of what is happening around us.
[00:01:56.360 --> 00:02:00.240]   That there are people who are asking that we don't just kind of spend the next month
[00:02:00.240 --> 00:02:06.520]   or so, you know, like the rest of the world, but be mindful of the non-Christians who are
[00:02:06.520 --> 00:02:10.520]   in our lives to be a deliberate witness to share the gospel with them.
[00:02:10.520 --> 00:02:13.840]   So the next three weeks that I'm here and then Pastor Peter Chung is going to give the
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:21.600]   message on the Jerusalem entrance and then, you know, we have that Passion Week.
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:24.480]   And so I want to prepare you for that.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.040]   So each week as we walk through the passages that we would prepare our hearts and that
[00:02:29.040 --> 00:02:34.480]   when we come to Good Friday, that we're not just celebrating a historical event, that
[00:02:34.480 --> 00:02:39.360]   we really are able to walk with him and have personal convictions and convicted by what
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:40.480]   he has done for us.
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:41.480]   Okay?
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:46.180]   So I'm going to read the passage in Isaiah chapter 40, just first two verses as we go
[00:02:46.180 --> 00:02:47.720]   through this text today.
[00:02:47.720 --> 00:02:51.840]   "Comfort, comfort, O my people, says your God.
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:57.520]   Speak kindly to Jerusalem and call out to her that her warfare has ended, that her iniquity
[00:02:57.520 --> 00:03:03.360]   has been removed, that she has received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins."
[00:03:03.360 --> 00:03:04.720]   Let's pray.
[00:03:05.360 --> 00:03:11.320]   Heavenly Father, we come before you asking for your guidance, for your Holy Spirit to
[00:03:11.320 --> 00:03:14.640]   speak to us through these words.
[00:03:14.640 --> 00:03:18.680]   As you are the Potter and we are the clay, mold us and make us, Lord God, into what you
[00:03:18.680 --> 00:03:20.840]   desire of us.
[00:03:20.840 --> 00:03:22.960]   Sanctify your church, Lord God, that your name may be glorified.
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:24.920]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:03:24.920 --> 00:03:25.920]   Amen.
[00:03:25.920 --> 00:03:29.880]   You know, last month or so I've been reading through this book.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   Okay?
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:33.720]   This is, this is actually my father's autobiography.
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:39.120]   He kind of made it into a, like a very easy to read autobiography of when, you know, his
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:42.800]   earliest memory all the way up to when he wrote this book.
[00:03:42.800 --> 00:03:46.860]   And he made it into like a autobiography slash devotional.
[00:03:46.860 --> 00:03:52.360]   So he would tell some story and then he would kind of have some biblical, you know, truths.
[00:03:52.360 --> 00:03:56.920]   And so it's like an easy devotional read, right?
[00:03:56.920 --> 00:03:59.720]   The first time I read this, I was in my 20s.
[00:03:59.720 --> 00:04:03.080]   So when I read it, I mean, it was very interesting because it was by my father, but I was in
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:04.820]   my 20s.
[00:04:04.820 --> 00:04:09.400]   So I didn't glean as much as I could have, but it was interesting.
[00:04:09.400 --> 00:04:12.520]   I didn't know, but I was reading it this time I found out that he was almost exactly the
[00:04:12.520 --> 00:04:15.100]   same age as I am now when he wrote this book.
[00:04:15.100 --> 00:04:19.720]   So as I'm reading it now, it has a different depth that I didn't see when I was in my 20s
[00:04:19.720 --> 00:04:24.280]   because now I can kind of understand the perspective that he's coming from because we're at the
[00:04:24.280 --> 00:04:26.880]   similar stage in life when he wrote this.
[00:04:26.880 --> 00:04:31.120]   Now when I, one of the chapters was really interesting to me and I actually already mentioned
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:33.680]   to some of the pastors.
[00:04:33.680 --> 00:04:37.960]   One thing that he mentioned was that how much he didn't like uniforms.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:42.440]   You know, and back in Korea in 1950s, you don't question leaders.
[00:04:42.440 --> 00:04:45.640]   And so, you know, and my dad does not have that kind of personality.
[00:04:45.640 --> 00:04:50.520]   He just kind of go with the flow type of guy, but he said how he protested wearing uniforms.
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:55.120]   And the reasoning why he gave was how the uniforms don't give freedom for people to
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:57.280]   kind of express themselves and really grow.
[00:04:57.280 --> 00:05:04.280]   The uniformity is beneficial to the people who are in authority, but for the regular
[00:05:04.280 --> 00:05:09.040]   people to be able to really, you know, to grow the way that God had created them.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.440]   And the reason why I was interested in that is because that's always kind of been my own
[00:05:12.440 --> 00:05:13.700]   philosophy.
[00:05:13.700 --> 00:05:17.600]   Even the raising my own children, I didn't want them to become somebody that I made them
[00:05:17.600 --> 00:05:21.680]   to be, but I want them to kind of express, you know, even if they struggle, even if they
[00:05:21.680 --> 00:05:25.480]   stray, that it's their own faith that they're expressing.
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:29.720]   And then, so I've always kind of been hands off in specifically what they do.
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:34.880]   And that's kind of how even the ministry philosophy, I don't like seeing just uniformity, just
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:40.120]   like you're supposed to do this because it's, I think true fruit always comes from what
[00:05:40.120 --> 00:05:41.120]   God is doing internally.
[00:05:41.120 --> 00:05:45.280]   And again, it was interesting to me because, you know, if I didn't read it, I would have
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:46.840]   never known that those were his thoughts.
[00:05:46.840 --> 00:05:47.840]   And I said, "Oh, okay.
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:48.840]   He thought the same way."
[00:05:48.840 --> 00:05:51.200]   Obviously, I got it from him, you know.
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:54.920]   I don't ever remember having this conversation, but, you know, it was just interesting to
[00:05:54.920 --> 00:05:57.680]   me as I was reading that, "Oh, he felt the same way."
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:02.160]   So it made me more curious about what else he has to say that I didn't remember in my
[00:06:02.160 --> 00:06:03.160]   20s.
[00:06:03.160 --> 00:06:09.280]   Now, I share all of this because sometimes we can read the Bible as just historical facts,
[00:06:09.280 --> 00:06:14.920]   theological things, and we get excited about theology without getting excited about God
[00:06:14.920 --> 00:06:16.920]   himself.
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:22.000]   You can study the Word of God all your life and not really come to a deeper affection
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:24.280]   for the God of the Word.
[00:06:24.280 --> 00:06:29.880]   The point of our study, the point of everything that we do is to draw us closer to God.
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:36.680]   And so when our extensive studies leads to greater knowledge without greater humility,
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.920]   greater intimacy with Christ, it does more damage than good.
[00:06:40.920 --> 00:06:43.080]   People are not impressed with our knowledge.
[00:06:43.080 --> 00:06:45.160]   What people want is Christ.
[00:06:45.160 --> 00:06:50.000]   And so as we study the Word of God, we want to make sure that we're not only understanding
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.600]   his words but his own heart.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:54.280]   And so that's my intention for the next few weeks.
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:58.160]   Even though we're going to be studying the Word of God, I'm hoping that we can understand
[00:06:58.160 --> 00:07:04.520]   the heart of God, of what's going to lead to the cross.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:08.960]   If you've studied the book of Isaiah before, you know that the book of Isaiah is really
[00:07:08.960 --> 00:07:11.920]   interesting because it has 66 chapters, just like the Bible.
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   We have 66 books.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:18.840]   And it's divided into two parts where you have 39 books in the Old Testament and 27
[00:07:18.840 --> 00:07:20.280]   in the New Testament.
[00:07:20.280 --> 00:07:24.200]   And the division in the book of Isaiah is exactly like that.
[00:07:24.200 --> 00:07:30.760]   We have 66 books and we have 39 chapters of God indicting the nation of Israel, kind of
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:35.440]   like the Bible says that the law was given so that sin will become utterly sinful.
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.980]   And so God reveals through 39 chapters of why judgment is coming.
[00:07:39.980 --> 00:07:46.040]   And then starting from chapter 40 on to chapter 66, it's promise of God's new covenant that's
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:47.040]   coming.
[00:07:47.040 --> 00:07:52.000]   And obviously specifically chapter 53 is a clear presentation of Christ and what he
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:53.520]   was going to do.
[00:07:53.520 --> 00:07:57.560]   And so it's interesting that the book of Isaiah is divided this way.
[00:07:57.560 --> 00:08:02.840]   And so the text that we're looking at in chapter 40 is a transition from God's indictment into
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.000]   the promise that he's making to the nation of Israel.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.680]   But in order to understand what he is saying, I want you to see what's happening and why
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:12.240]   he leads to chapter 40.
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:17.800]   See, at the end of chapter 39, as he concludes the indictment against Israel, the historical
[00:08:17.800 --> 00:08:23.300]   background behind that is the Northern Kingdom has already fallen.
[00:08:23.300 --> 00:08:25.000]   And so they've gone to the Assyrians.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.320]   And so the Southern Kingdom has been kind of moving along, but they were also in danger
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:34.800]   because the Assyrians have become so powerful and they're surrounded by superpowers.
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.400]   And so King Hezekiah, who was a good king, had an idea that if he aligned himself with
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:44.640]   the superpower that they would be protected.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:47.240]   So he started to become chummy with the Babylonians.
[00:08:47.240 --> 00:08:53.040]   And when, as he started building this relationship, he basically opened up the temple and showed
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.900]   all of his inner courts and everything that they had, hoping that somehow if they aligned
[00:08:58.900 --> 00:09:04.560]   themselves with them, that if the other superpowers come and attack them, that they would be safe.
[00:09:04.560 --> 00:09:10.200]   Now obviously this very much displeased God because God wanted them, the whole point of
[00:09:10.200 --> 00:09:14.920]   Israel's history is so that God can use them to glorify himself.
[00:09:14.920 --> 00:09:19.120]   But by this time, even a good king, even Hezekiah, started to drift thinking that if they had
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:22.520]   political power, that they would become safe.
[00:09:22.520 --> 00:09:29.480]   So it's in that context that Isaiah is given this message to Israel.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:33.280]   In chapter 39, verse 6 through 8, it says, "Behold, the days are coming when all that
[00:09:33.280 --> 00:09:39.100]   is in your house and all that your fathers have laid up in store to this day will be
[00:09:39.100 --> 00:09:40.320]   carried to Babylon.
[00:09:40.320 --> 00:09:42.820]   Nothing will be left, says the Lord.
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:47.440]   And some of your sons who will issue from you whom you will beget will be taken away
[00:09:47.440 --> 00:09:50.880]   and they will become officials in the palace of the king of Babylon."
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.660]   So clearly this is an indictment against Israel.
[00:09:53.660 --> 00:09:55.880]   Everything that you have shown, they're going to be taken away.
[00:09:55.880 --> 00:09:59.840]   And then your children are also going to be forced to go to Babylon and they will become
[00:09:59.840 --> 00:10:00.880]   officials.
[00:10:00.880 --> 00:10:03.280]   But this is how dense Israel has become.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:06.440]   And you can see that in Hezekiah's response.
[00:10:06.440 --> 00:10:10.100]   Verse 8, "Hezekiah said to Isaiah, 'The word of the Lord which you have spoken is
[00:10:10.100 --> 00:10:11.660]   good.'
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:16.860]   For he thought, 'For there will be peace and truth in my days.'"
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:21.980]   Now the reason why he heard it as good is because that's exactly what Hezekiah wanted.
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:27.560]   Because if our officials go and they take and we become one, we'll be safe.
[00:10:27.560 --> 00:10:29.660]   That's what Hezekiah was thinking.
[00:10:29.660 --> 00:10:32.980]   That's how far Israel has drifted away from God.
[00:10:32.980 --> 00:10:34.940]   And it wasn't because they were worshiping idols.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.980]   It wasn't because they weren't sacrificing at the temple.
[00:10:37.980 --> 00:10:40.580]   It's just that they forgot who God is.
[00:10:40.580 --> 00:10:46.580]   And it's as a result of that, because you relied on Babylon more than me, now the Babylonians
[00:10:46.580 --> 00:10:48.340]   are going to come exactly what you have pursued.
[00:10:48.340 --> 00:10:50.640]   You're going to get what you want.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:54.580]   But they didn't understand that what they wanted was ultimately going to lead to the
[00:10:54.580 --> 00:10:56.480]   judgment.
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:11:01.140]   And so this transition takes place from chapter 39, indictment against them.
[00:11:01.140 --> 00:11:05.780]   But he reminds them what he said from the very beginning, that God's heart to them is
[00:11:05.780 --> 00:11:06.820]   not for the judgment.
[00:11:06.820 --> 00:11:12.180]   The judgment was coming in order to properly restore them to God.
[00:11:12.180 --> 00:11:16.500]   And that's where he says in chapter 40, verse 1, "Comfort, O comfort my people," says your
[00:11:16.500 --> 00:11:17.500]   God.
[00:11:17.500 --> 00:11:23.560]   "Speak kindly to Jerusalem and call out to her that her warfare has ended, that her iniquity
[00:11:23.560 --> 00:11:29.500]   has been removed, that she has received of the Lord's hand double for all her sins."
[00:11:29.500 --> 00:11:32.860]   Now he's not saying here in chapter 40, after making the indictment, he said, "You know,
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:36.860]   I'm just going to forget this and sweep this under the rug and pretend like it never happened."
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.020]   That's not what he's saying.
[00:11:39.020 --> 00:11:45.420]   He's saying once everything that has been ordained because of your sins takes place,
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:52.240]   once you're taken into captivity, once you lose all the things that he says, and when
[00:11:52.240 --> 00:12:00.960]   you become pitiful, and you become nothing, and you realize where you are, and you plead
[00:12:00.960 --> 00:12:08.320]   to him, he's promising that he will give them mercy when you return.
[00:12:08.320 --> 00:12:11.240]   This has always been God's heart.
[00:12:11.240 --> 00:12:15.980]   God will never compromise his righteousness and peace.
[00:12:15.980 --> 00:12:20.260]   He never compromises his love and his holiness.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:27.640]   He will always represent himself where both of who he is, what he is, is never compromised.
[00:12:27.640 --> 00:12:30.160]   He will never look at our sins and say, "You know what?
[00:12:30.160 --> 00:12:33.960]   For this one, I'm just going to sweep it under the rug because I love you so much, I'm going
[00:12:33.960 --> 00:12:34.960]   to let you out."
[00:12:34.960 --> 00:12:37.360]   He says, "No.
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:41.560]   Once the very thing that you think is going to bring safety and peace, you're going to
[00:12:41.560 --> 00:12:47.080]   pursue it, and you're going to have it, not realizing that that is an indictment against
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:48.080]   him."
[00:12:48.080 --> 00:12:51.320]   Paul says something very similar in the Corinthians.
[00:12:51.320 --> 00:12:55.980]   One of the most harshest letters that Paul writes is to the Corinthians, where because
[00:12:55.980 --> 00:13:02.180]   of the divisions in the church, their communion wasn't true communion.
[00:13:02.180 --> 00:13:04.860]   Their fellowship was causing all kinds of divisions.
[00:13:04.860 --> 00:13:09.780]   In fact, they said they were tolerating sin in the church that even the unbelievers, even
[00:13:09.780 --> 00:13:13.780]   the pagans wouldn't tolerate because the church was so corrupt.
[00:13:13.780 --> 00:13:19.420]   He was reminding them, "Do you not know that your body is the temple and the Spirit of
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.860]   God dwells in it, and he who destroys it, he will also be destroyed."
[00:13:22.860 --> 00:13:25.300]   He indicts them, and he cuts them.
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:28.740]   Because he writes such a harsh letter, many of the Corinthians begin to question, "Who's
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:29.740]   this guy?
[00:13:29.740 --> 00:13:33.940]   I thought God is a God of love, but why is this guy coming to us saying that he's going
[00:13:33.940 --> 00:13:37.900]   to come with the whip if we don't change?"
[00:13:37.900 --> 00:13:40.540]   Some were questioning his apostleship.
[00:13:40.540 --> 00:13:45.180]   Some were very deeply cut and hurt, and those who didn't repent were basically questioning
[00:13:45.180 --> 00:13:46.180]   him.
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:50.940]   And so he writes in 2 Corinthians 7, he says, "For though I caused you sorrow by my letter,
[00:13:50.940 --> 00:13:51.940]   I do not regret it.
[00:13:51.940 --> 00:13:56.180]   Though I did regret it, for I see that the letter caused you sorrow, though only for
[00:13:56.180 --> 00:13:57.380]   a while.
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:14:02.380]   I now rejoice, not that you were made sorrowful, but that you were made sorrowful to the point
[00:14:02.380 --> 00:14:08.260]   of repentance, for you were made sorrowful according to the will of God."
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:14.820]   He says God deliberately put pressure on them, cut them, because living with sin swept under
[00:14:14.820 --> 00:14:23.920]   the rug may seem to bring you peace for the moment, but until God is declared righteous
[00:14:23.920 --> 00:14:29.700]   and we are intimately in fellowship with him, no amount of money, no amount of political
[00:14:29.700 --> 00:14:35.020]   peace, no amount of economic stability is going to bring the true peace that only Christ
[00:14:35.020 --> 00:14:36.780]   can bring.
[00:14:36.780 --> 00:14:40.180]   There is no parent who loves their child.
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.820]   We may have different philosophies of raising children, but there is no parent who loves
[00:14:43.820 --> 00:14:49.260]   their child, who does not discipline their child if they know that that child is headed
[00:14:49.260 --> 00:14:51.220]   the wrong direction.
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:56.500]   Now some of your friends may ignore it, even though they're convinced that you are headed
[00:14:56.500 --> 00:14:58.040]   down the wrong path.
[00:14:58.040 --> 00:15:02.420]   They may ignore it because they like you, but they like themselves more than you.
[00:15:02.420 --> 00:15:04.100]   They don't want the wrath coming from you.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:06.620]   They don't want you to say, "Oh, you're judging me."
[00:15:06.620 --> 00:15:08.700]   They don't want to hear that.
[00:15:08.700 --> 00:15:13.260]   So even though you're headed toward the wrong direction, they may not say anything to you.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:18.020]   But the ones who love you, they will say something.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.300]   You will say something to your brother or your sister or your mom or somebody you really
[00:15:23.300 --> 00:15:29.700]   love, because no matter what you may think of me, I'm more concerned about the harm that
[00:15:29.700 --> 00:15:32.020]   you're doing to yourself.
[00:15:32.020 --> 00:15:38.060]   So living in this fake peace is not true peace.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:39.940]   We're just kind of sweeping it under the rug.
[00:15:39.940 --> 00:15:42.160]   And this is what God is trying to tell the nation of Israel.
[00:15:42.160 --> 00:15:45.940]   Even though harshness, even though God speaks harshly and you will experience suffering
[00:15:45.940 --> 00:15:53.060]   because of your sins, God's heart is always gentle.
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:55.100]   His desire always is to restore.
[00:15:55.100 --> 00:16:01.200]   So he says in Isaiah 42, verse 3, "A bruised reed he will not break, and a dimly burning
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.060]   wick he will not extinguish."
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:06.740]   He's speaking specific to the nation of Israel.
[00:16:06.740 --> 00:16:11.300]   He said he's going to allow their sins to take its course.
[00:16:11.300 --> 00:16:17.940]   And when they become pathetic, like a bruised reed, when they become useless, like a burning
[00:16:17.940 --> 00:16:23.860]   wick, and when they get thrown to the ground to be trampled, when everybody walking by
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:27.260]   said they're not going to have pity on you, you don't throw away trash.
[00:16:27.260 --> 00:16:29.620]   It's like, "Oh, let's have pity on that."
[00:16:29.620 --> 00:16:33.340]   A burning wick, a bruised reed.
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:39.260]   But God says that even when the nation of Israel becomes that pathetic, he said he will
[00:16:39.260 --> 00:16:41.420]   not turn away.
[00:16:41.420 --> 00:16:46.740]   Isaiah 49, 15-16, "Can a woman forget her nursing child and have no compassion in the
[00:16:46.740 --> 00:16:48.100]   son of her womb?
[00:16:48.100 --> 00:16:51.300]   Even these may forget, but I will not forget you."
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:53.100]   He's talking to the nation of Israel.
[00:16:53.100 --> 00:16:59.020]   He said even after all of that, even after rebelling, he said, "Because I made a covenant
[00:16:59.020 --> 00:17:00.180]   with you, I will not forget.
[00:17:00.180 --> 00:17:03.700]   Behold, I have inscribed you on the palm of my hands.
[00:17:03.700 --> 00:17:06.500]   Your walls are continually before me."
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:12.620]   Do you remember when you were young, what you put on the palm?
[00:17:12.620 --> 00:17:16.380]   Some of you cheat notes, right?
[00:17:16.380 --> 00:17:18.700]   Before Christ's days, right?
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:20.620]   But let's say something positive.
[00:17:20.620 --> 00:17:23.220]   Why do you write things on your palm?
[00:17:23.220 --> 00:17:24.220]   So you won't forget.
[00:17:24.220 --> 00:17:32.780]   Let's say you woke up and your anniversary is next week, and you screwed up the last
[00:17:32.780 --> 00:17:38.820]   three years, and then you want to make sure, so you inscribe it on your palm to make sure
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:42.140]   so every time you do something that you're reminded, right?
[00:17:42.140 --> 00:17:44.500]   And that's exactly what he means by that.
[00:17:44.500 --> 00:17:48.300]   He's saying that I've inscribed you on the palm of my hands.
[00:17:48.300 --> 00:17:50.060]   I cannot forget you.
[00:17:50.060 --> 00:17:56.660]   Even if a woman forgets a nursing child, I cannot.
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:59.220]   He's talking to the nation of Israel.
[00:17:59.220 --> 00:18:07.300]   After all that they have done, even after crucifying their Savior, he says, "Because
[00:18:07.300 --> 00:18:10.900]   you're my nation, you're the apple of my eye," he said, "I will not forget you."
[00:18:10.900 --> 00:18:13.700]   In fact, we bring this all the way to the New Testament.
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:17.580]   Apostle Paul is writing to the Jews who thought that they had a righteous standing before
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:21.380]   God because they were children of Abraham.
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:25.980]   The whole book of Romans is to bring indictment to the nation of Israel.
[00:18:25.980 --> 00:18:28.020]   Those who have the law will be judged by the law.
[00:18:28.020 --> 00:18:31.620]   Those who don't have the law will be judged without the law, for all have sinned and fall
[00:18:31.620 --> 00:18:33.820]   short of the glory of God.
[00:18:33.820 --> 00:18:36.980]   And because he's making this argument, he knows what the Jews are thinking.
[00:18:36.980 --> 00:18:40.700]   If we're all under the judgment of God, what place do we have?
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.940]   Has God forsaken us?
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:47.420]   Have we fallen to the point where God is moving on from the covenant that he gave us?
[00:18:47.420 --> 00:18:51.420]   He answers this question in chapter 11, verse 1 and 2 in Romans.
[00:18:51.420 --> 00:18:55.820]   He says, "I say then, God has not rejected his people, has he?
[00:18:55.820 --> 00:18:59.260]   May it never be.
[00:18:59.260 --> 00:19:02.500]   Don't even think of it.
[00:19:02.500 --> 00:19:05.300]   God said that I've written you in the palm of my hands.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:07.820]   How can he forget you?
[00:19:07.820 --> 00:19:12.580]   For I too am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, of the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:19:12.580 --> 00:19:16.900]   God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew."
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:21.260]   Some people think that because they've broken God's covenant over and over again, that God
[00:19:21.260 --> 00:19:28.300]   decided to move his covenant to the Gentiles now, so they're done.
[00:19:28.300 --> 00:19:29.380]   No.
[00:19:29.380 --> 00:19:33.940]   God makes it very clear that the covenant that he made with Israel, despite their sins,
[00:19:33.940 --> 00:19:39.380]   at one point, when it is time, he's going to renew this covenant with them, because
[00:19:39.380 --> 00:19:41.260]   he has them written on the palm of his hand.
[00:19:41.260 --> 00:19:42.900]   This is who God is.
[00:19:42.900 --> 00:19:47.060]   In Romans chapter 11, verse 11, he says, "I say then, they did not stumble so as to fall,
[00:19:47.060 --> 00:19:48.060]   did they?
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:50.020]   May it never be.
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:54.020]   But by their transgression, salvation has come to the Gentiles to make them jealous."
[00:19:54.020 --> 00:20:00.340]   Now, if God has done with the nation of Israel, what is he making them jealous for?
[00:20:00.340 --> 00:20:02.980]   Just to rub it in?
[00:20:02.980 --> 00:20:03.980]   Just to rub it in?
[00:20:03.980 --> 00:20:04.980]   You can't have what they have?
[00:20:04.980 --> 00:20:06.980]   That's why he's making them jealous?
[00:20:06.980 --> 00:20:07.980]   No.
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:11.540]   He's making them jealous, because the time has come that this jealousy would cause them
[00:20:11.540 --> 00:20:15.380]   to bring revival, and that the nation of Israel, the covenant that he made with the nation
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:17.780]   of Israel, will be fulfilled.
[00:20:17.780 --> 00:20:24.420]   Now, you may ask, "That's great for the nation of Israel, but what does that have to do with
[00:20:24.420 --> 00:20:25.420]   us?"
[00:20:25.420 --> 00:20:29.860]   It has everything to do with us, because the God who is faithful to his covenant to the
[00:20:29.860 --> 00:20:35.340]   nation of Israel is the same God who is faithful to the covenant he made with us.
[00:20:35.340 --> 00:20:41.340]   So as much as we can trust God and his compassionate and loving heart to the nation of Israel,
[00:20:41.340 --> 00:20:49.540]   despite all that they have done, he says, "Comfort, comfort my people," says the Lord.
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:52.460]   Speak kindly to Jerusalem.
[00:20:52.460 --> 00:20:55.320]   This is our God.
[00:20:55.320 --> 00:20:56.740]   This is our God.
[00:20:56.740 --> 00:20:59.140]   Yes, he speaks harshly.
[00:20:59.140 --> 00:21:02.220]   Yes, he warns us about judgment.
[00:21:02.220 --> 00:21:05.940]   But in the midst of all of that, he waits patiently for us.
[00:21:05.940 --> 00:21:10.460]   "Comfort, comfort my people," says the Lord.
[00:21:10.460 --> 00:21:14.660]   How often have we thought we have exhausted his grace?
[00:21:14.660 --> 00:21:20.520]   How often have we convinced ourselves that we're not worthy of the communion table?
[00:21:20.520 --> 00:21:23.540]   How often does somebody else tell us that you're not worthy?
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:29.460]   How often has Satan indicted you because of your weakness?
[00:21:29.460 --> 00:21:35.660]   I pray that as this has comforted me over the years, that it would bring comfort to
[00:21:35.660 --> 00:21:38.780]   all of us, that this is why Jesus came.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.340]   Isaiah 43 to 4 says, "A voice is calling, 'Clear the way for the Lord in wilderness.
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.180]   Make smooth in the desert a highway for our God.
[00:21:46.180 --> 00:21:49.900]   Let every valley be lifted up and every mountain and hill be made low.
[00:21:49.900 --> 00:21:56.400]   And let the rough ground become a plain and the rugged terrain a broad valley.'"
[00:21:56.400 --> 00:22:03.180]   The reason why Isaiah uses that imagery is because the nation of Israel, they established
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:07.280]   six cities of refuge, spread out all over Israel.
[00:22:07.280 --> 00:22:09.600]   And it was the most visible.
[00:22:09.600 --> 00:22:15.980]   And all the best roads in Jerusalem and in Israel led to the cities of refuge.
[00:22:15.980 --> 00:22:21.460]   They spent so much time, energy, and money to make sure, literally, to cut down any hills
[00:22:21.460 --> 00:22:24.980]   or mountains or any valleys that got in the way.
[00:22:24.980 --> 00:22:31.060]   So that somebody who had to flee for refuge in this city could have the easiest and the
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:33.260]   quickest path.
[00:22:33.260 --> 00:22:38.980]   All of that was established to ultimately point to Christ our refuge.
[00:22:38.980 --> 00:22:44.280]   That the Messiah was going to come and He's going to be the high priest over these cities
[00:22:44.280 --> 00:22:49.200]   of refuge to point to us to run to Him in times of trouble.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:53.380]   And that the easiest and the best roads always leads to Christ.
[00:22:53.380 --> 00:22:55.760]   That's why John the Baptist came in Matthew 3, 3, and 4.
[00:22:55.760 --> 00:22:59.760]   This is the one referred to by Isaiah the prophet when he said, "The voice of one crying
[00:22:59.760 --> 00:23:02.120]   in the wilderness, 'Make ready the way of the Lord.
[00:23:02.120 --> 00:23:05.140]   Make His path straight.'"
[00:23:05.140 --> 00:23:11.740]   The reason why Isaiah is saying this is because Hezekiah thought that if he built a bridge
[00:23:11.740 --> 00:23:20.280]   to Babylon, that if he had allies on his side, that their country would be safe.
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:24.220]   That if they give them the inner chambers and say, "Oh, this is what we have," maybe
[00:23:24.220 --> 00:23:27.900]   the Babylonians will come to their rescue.
[00:23:27.900 --> 00:23:32.340]   And this is the reason why he's reminding the nation of Israel that they are not your
[00:23:32.340 --> 00:23:33.340]   refuge.
[00:23:33.340 --> 00:23:40.440]   I mean, as I mentioned, we're living now with people in our generation who is looking
[00:23:40.440 --> 00:23:42.900]   for some sort of refuge.
[00:23:42.900 --> 00:23:44.660]   Because we don't know what tomorrow is going to bring.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:47.000]   Is pandemic going to be over soon?
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:49.660]   Every time we think it's going to be over, there's some other variant that's coming
[00:23:49.660 --> 00:23:50.660]   in.
[00:23:50.660 --> 00:23:51.660]   Is this going to be over soon?
[00:23:51.660 --> 00:23:53.320]   How about the stock market?
[00:23:53.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   Where is this headed?
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:24:00.580]   With the economy going the way it is, every time we turn around, the gas is going up.
[00:24:00.580 --> 00:24:02.820]   I mean, for many of us, it's just inconvenient.
[00:24:02.820 --> 00:24:07.060]   But there's a lot of people with the gas prices going up, can't go to work.
[00:24:07.060 --> 00:24:09.620]   It's serious.
[00:24:09.620 --> 00:24:13.260]   Even though many of us, maybe we're financially well enough, it's just an annoyance.
[00:24:13.260 --> 00:24:17.120]   But it has serious consequences.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:18.960]   And then you have the war that's happening in Ukraine.
[00:24:18.960 --> 00:24:21.520]   I mean, we don't know.
[00:24:21.520 --> 00:24:26.480]   And there's more and more as things go along, the talk of, is he crazy enough to use the
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:27.480]   nuclear bomb?
[00:24:27.480 --> 00:24:31.100]   And if he does do that, what's going to happen?
[00:24:31.100 --> 00:24:33.560]   Is this going to trigger another World War III?
[00:24:33.560 --> 00:24:37.720]   Does that mean that the NATO is also going to retaliate with nuclear bomb?
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:42.900]   And they said that we have enough nuclear bombs distributed in the countries that can
[00:24:42.900 --> 00:24:45.880]   blow up the world 20 times over.
[00:24:45.880 --> 00:24:49.480]   So no wonder people are shaken up.
[00:24:49.480 --> 00:24:53.720]   No wonder people are anxious, that everything that we've been trying to build can slap
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:59.920]   a finger because of one crazy guy, this one nation, it could all be over.
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:04.400]   Now we think to ourselves, I mean, we've lived this long and we've seen crisis before, and
[00:25:04.400 --> 00:25:07.120]   so we'll be fine.
[00:25:07.120 --> 00:25:13.380]   We may tell ourselves that, but we know the reality is it can happen.
[00:25:13.380 --> 00:25:19.780]   And even if it doesn't happen, even if that is not the end, we know end is coming.
[00:25:19.780 --> 00:25:22.860]   Where do we run to refuge?
[00:25:22.860 --> 00:25:26.600]   Whose words brings you the greatest comfort?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:30.940]   What are you waiting for in the next stage that you think is somehow is going to bring
[00:25:30.940 --> 00:25:33.400]   peace?
[00:25:33.400 --> 00:25:35.360]   You may not call it Babylon.
[00:25:35.360 --> 00:25:40.820]   You may call it something else, but any bridge, any road that leads us anywhere outside from
[00:25:40.820 --> 00:25:46.380]   Christ is going to bring upon us more judgment than good.
[00:25:46.380 --> 00:25:49.200]   And that's why he's reminded the nation of Israel.
[00:25:49.200 --> 00:25:52.060]   He said he was going to come in Isaiah chapter 118.
[00:25:52.060 --> 00:25:57.660]   He starts out by this promise, even though he's going to spend 39 chapters indicting
[00:25:57.660 --> 00:26:02.620]   the nation of Israel, the very beginning of chapter one, he says, come now, let us reason
[00:26:02.620 --> 00:26:08.140]   together, says the Lord, though your sins are as scarlet, they will be as white as snow.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:12.720]   Though they are red like crimson, they will be like wool.
[00:26:12.720 --> 00:26:19.300]   He tells them that before he indicts them, before he spends 39 chapters detailing why
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:24.580]   judgment is coming, he says, no, but I will make you like wool.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:31.240]   Now imagine if you're hearing that, and that's just only one verse, but in almost every prophet
[00:26:31.240 --> 00:26:35.540]   where there's an indictment, there's also a promise that he makes, just like he does
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:36.540]   here.
[00:26:36.540 --> 00:26:37.540]   Come for my people.
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.540]   I will never forget them.
[00:26:38.540 --> 00:26:42.100]   There's going to come a time when the Messiah is going to come, that he's going to suffer
[00:26:42.100 --> 00:26:46.900]   for our sake, and he's going to bring about a new age where he's going to remember his
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:52.660]   covenant that he made with the nation of Israel, and he's going to wipe away sins.
[00:26:52.660 --> 00:26:58.700]   And all this is going to happen through the Messiah.
[00:26:58.700 --> 00:26:59.700]   How is that going to happen?
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:04.740]   Because we've heard this, and we sing about this every single Sunday, so it's become so
[00:27:04.740 --> 00:27:05.740]   mundane.
[00:27:05.740 --> 00:27:09.960]   I would say the majority of you, if I asked you what the gospel is, it's like Jesus Christ
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:16.400]   loved me, you know, despite my sins, he died for our sins, he was crucified on the cross,
[00:27:16.400 --> 00:27:17.760]   and he died, and he was resurrected.
[00:27:17.760 --> 00:27:22.720]   And so some of you can be a bit more articulate and fill in the details, but whatever the
[00:27:22.720 --> 00:27:28.560]   case is, we know the general outline of what Christ has done for us.
[00:27:28.560 --> 00:27:32.940]   See the Old Testament covenant, when the prophets started prophesying this, they couldn't believe
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:35.160]   it.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.400]   How can this happen?
[00:27:38.400 --> 00:27:41.560]   How can the Messiah die for us?
[00:27:41.560 --> 00:27:43.380]   What?
[00:27:43.380 --> 00:27:45.400]   What are you talking about?
[00:27:45.400 --> 00:27:47.820]   Even as they are prophesying, they couldn't believe it.
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:51.980]   So in 1 Peter 1, 10 through 12, it says, "As this salvation, the prophets who prophesied
[00:27:51.980 --> 00:27:56.640]   of the grace that would come to you, made careful searches and inquiries, seeking to
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:01.080]   know what person or time the Spirit of Christ within them was indicating as he predicted
[00:28:01.080 --> 00:28:05.440]   the suffering of Christ and the glories to follow."
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.080]   Really this is going to happen?
[00:28:07.080 --> 00:28:10.660]   Christ is going to come and he's going to suffer?
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:13.160]   And that's how we're going to be made white as snow?
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:17.680]   It goes on, "It was revealed to them that they were not serving themselves, but you
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:22.460]   in these things, which now have been announced to you through those who preach the gospel
[00:28:22.460 --> 00:28:28.920]   to you by the Holy Spirit sent from heaven, things into which angels long to look."
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:33.840]   Even the angels as their prophecy is going out or looking into it, it's like, "What?
[00:28:33.840 --> 00:28:40.680]   He's going to make us new by the blood of Christ?
[00:28:40.680 --> 00:28:41.680]   Who's going to do that?
[00:28:41.680 --> 00:28:42.680]   When is he going to do that?
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:43.680]   How is he going to do that?"
[00:28:43.680 --> 00:28:47.620]   Even as they are prophesying, this was unbelievable.
[00:28:47.620 --> 00:28:56.360]   But now we are on this side where we have seen clearly what he has done and majority
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.200]   of the response is, "That's nice.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.200]   That's good.
[00:29:01.200 --> 00:29:03.240]   We're going to sing about it.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:06.600]   We're going to have nice Bible tattoos."
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:15.520]   In and of itself, none of that is bad, but the gospel message and the sacrifice has become
[00:29:15.520 --> 00:29:25.320]   so mundane because we sing it, we memorize it, we study it in VBS, but the reality, God
[00:29:25.320 --> 00:29:28.520]   who created the universe?
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.760]   Think about that.
[00:29:29.760 --> 00:29:37.800]   If I told you that I'm going to give everybody in this room a Tesla, would you believe it?
[00:29:37.800 --> 00:29:43.680]   I said, "Well, I know you don't have money, so let's ... We're fantasizing, right?
[00:29:43.680 --> 00:29:46.200]   Let's say I do have the money.
[00:29:46.200 --> 00:29:48.560]   Would you believe it?"
[00:29:48.560 --> 00:29:54.760]   Some of you may, some of you may not, but I think most of you will be skeptical.
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:56.960]   I'm going to give 75% of what I have.
[00:29:56.960 --> 00:29:57.960]   I'm just going to give it to you.
[00:29:57.960 --> 00:29:58.960]   Why?
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:01.840]   Just because I'm generous.
[00:30:01.840 --> 00:30:09.440]   Something as trivial as money, that all it is is like I just need to empty my bank account,
[00:30:09.440 --> 00:30:10.440]   give it to you.
[00:30:10.440 --> 00:30:11.440]   My lifestyle is not going to change.
[00:30:11.440 --> 00:30:17.680]   If you decide to be generous, you'll be talking about me the rest of your life.
[00:30:17.680 --> 00:30:21.840]   Our pastor, he emptied his bank account.
[00:30:21.840 --> 00:30:27.040]   Let me guarantee you that's not going to happen, but I'm just like, we're fantasizing, right?
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:28.420]   Wow.
[00:30:28.420 --> 00:30:34.040]   So anybody who got that is going to be talking about that the rest of their life.
[00:30:34.040 --> 00:30:35.760]   Our pastor is just so generous.
[00:30:35.760 --> 00:30:39.920]   It's unbelievable what he did for me.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:49.760]   And yet when we talk about the son of God who created the universe, died for sinners
[00:30:49.760 --> 00:31:00.160]   and rebellion, was crucified, resurrected, all the while knowing our rebellion, past,
[00:31:00.160 --> 00:31:03.800]   present and future.
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:08.080]   And that knowledge doesn't change us.
[00:31:08.080 --> 00:31:11.320]   We're reluctant to share it.
[00:31:11.320 --> 00:31:14.880]   We're still chasing after the world.
[00:31:14.880 --> 00:31:18.120]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:18.120 --> 00:31:19.600]   Does that make sense?
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:27.880]   See, that sounds like a mad person to declare that son of God purchased me with his own
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:35.960]   blood and then to have the rest of our lives look no different than anybody else.
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.480]   That sounds like a mad person.
[00:31:37.480 --> 00:31:40.440]   You actually believe that?
[00:31:40.440 --> 00:31:47.680]   And if you do believe that, why do you not look any different than me?
[00:31:47.680 --> 00:31:51.520]   Why do the very things that scare me, scare you?
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:54.880]   Why are you tempted by the same thing that tempt me?
[00:31:54.880 --> 00:31:59.920]   Why are the things that the world holds for the same thing you hope for?
[00:31:59.920 --> 00:32:11.800]   You see, what we sing and praise and memorize and teach has become so mundane and pedestrian
[00:32:11.800 --> 00:32:17.040]   that we forget what it was like when we first met Christ.
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:20.640]   That's why the Bible keeps saying, "Remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:27.900]   Remember how mind-blowing it is that the God of the universe loved you."
[00:32:27.900 --> 00:32:36.400]   See, we have become so comfortable, and what we are adopting to is a cultural Christianity,
[00:32:36.400 --> 00:32:40.040]   not the real Christianity of Scripture.
[00:32:40.040 --> 00:32:44.480]   Scripture tells us that when Jesus comes in second time, he's described in Revelation
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:52.400]   chapter 114, his head and his hair were like white wool, like snow, and his eyes were like
[00:32:52.400 --> 00:32:53.460]   a flame of fire.
[00:32:53.460 --> 00:32:59.880]   Just like it was mentioned in Isaiah chapter 118, he's going to make us like white as snow.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:04.720]   He's described in his second coming as coming as white as snow.
[00:33:04.720 --> 00:33:09.840]   Zechariah chapter 3, 3-4 gives us the clearest picture of how he was going to make us white
[00:33:09.840 --> 00:33:10.840]   as snow.
[00:33:10.840 --> 00:33:14.580]   "Now Joshua was clothed with filthy garments and standing before the angel.
[00:33:14.580 --> 00:33:18.360]   He spoke and said to those who were standing before him, saying, 'Remove the filthy garments
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:19.360]   from him.'
[00:33:19.360 --> 00:33:23.520]   Then he said to him, 'See, I have taken your iniquity away from you and will clothe you
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.480]   with festal robes.'"
[00:33:26.480 --> 00:33:34.000]   He was going to make us righteous by giving us his garment, taking off our filthy rags
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:35.320]   that we may have his righteousness.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:40.160]   That's exactly what it says in 2 Corinthians 5-21, "He who knew no sin became sin so that
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:45.000]   you and I may become the righteousness of Christ."
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:53.800]   Again, step away from the numbness that we've allowed ourselves to step into, the lukewarmness
[00:33:53.800 --> 00:33:57.040]   that we've allowed to be a regular part of our lives.
[00:33:57.040 --> 00:34:01.000]   Take a step away from that and hear that like you heard that for the first time in your
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:03.800]   life.
[00:34:03.800 --> 00:34:13.640]   Son of God, the very reason why you and I have breath, why the universe works the way
[00:34:13.640 --> 00:34:23.360]   that it does, instead of seeing us and being disgusted by our sins, he says, "Comfort,
[00:34:23.360 --> 00:34:26.120]   comfort my people.
[00:34:26.120 --> 00:34:28.840]   Speak kindly to them."
[00:34:28.840 --> 00:34:34.600]   He drew near to us and he suffered on our behalf.
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:38.480]   Even now, it says, "It's his kindness that leads us to repentance."
[00:34:38.480 --> 00:34:40.800]   He says, "Come."
[00:34:40.800 --> 00:34:47.520]   When we see filth, our natural instinct is to move, put it in the trash.
[00:34:47.520 --> 00:34:51.080]   And if it's beyond us, we'll move to another neighborhood.
[00:34:51.080 --> 00:34:54.760]   And if people act that way, we keep them at an arm's length.
[00:34:54.760 --> 00:34:55.880]   We don't go to neighborhoods.
[00:34:55.880 --> 00:34:56.960]   We don't ride buses.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.320]   We don't go to parts of the world.
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.840]   So when we travel, we go to the best and the nicest places.
[00:35:01.840 --> 00:35:03.760]   You don't go to the slums.
[00:35:03.760 --> 00:35:07.960]   You don't go to dangerous places because our natural instinct is, if it's disgusting, keep
[00:35:07.960 --> 00:35:10.840]   it away.
[00:35:10.840 --> 00:35:15.120]   God saw the filthiness of our sins.
[00:35:15.120 --> 00:35:18.280]   And he knew what it would mean for him to remove himself.
[00:35:18.280 --> 00:35:22.200]   It would be our own death.
[00:35:22.200 --> 00:35:28.760]   So he wants to reveal to us, because we didn't even recognize how filthy our sins were, he
[00:35:28.760 --> 00:35:32.060]   gave the law so that we could recognize.
[00:35:32.060 --> 00:35:36.760]   Even Hezekiah didn't recognize the sin in his own heart.
[00:35:36.760 --> 00:35:44.560]   So once it has been revealed, once the judgment has come, he said, "Comfort, comfort my people."
[00:35:44.560 --> 00:35:49.960]   He says in Isaiah 46, verse 8, "The voice says, 'Call out,' then he answered, 'What
[00:35:49.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   shall we call out?
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:55.040]   All flesh is like grass, and all its loveliness is like the flower of the field.
[00:35:55.040 --> 00:36:00.460]   The grass withers, the flower fades, when the breath of the Lord breathes upon it.'"
[00:36:00.460 --> 00:36:03.080]   You notice here, he says, "It's not just circumstance.
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:05.240]   God breathes on it.
[00:36:05.240 --> 00:36:08.360]   To test the quality of what you have."
[00:36:08.360 --> 00:36:11.040]   When he breathes on it, surely the people are like grass.
[00:36:11.040 --> 00:36:16.580]   Grass withers, the flower fades, but the word of God stands forever.
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:22.400]   Whatever that we naturally run to refuge, when God breathes his breath, will it stand
[00:36:22.400 --> 00:36:23.400]   the test?
[00:36:23.400 --> 00:36:29.600]   You know, what's happening in Ukraine, I mean, it is, the whole world is watching.
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:36.180]   It's gut-wrenching to see young children, wives, young families fleeing for their lives.
[00:36:36.180 --> 00:36:41.520]   But people in Ukraine, they're not any different than us.
[00:36:41.520 --> 00:36:44.480]   Some of them had weddings planned.
[00:36:44.480 --> 00:36:46.680]   Some of them had schools to go to.
[00:36:46.680 --> 00:36:49.120]   The young families where moms pregnant.
[00:36:49.120 --> 00:36:54.260]   Hospitals, working, people working hard to save up enough money for retirement.
[00:36:54.260 --> 00:37:00.060]   Their lives didn't look any different than us, but all of a sudden, war broke out.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.140]   Now the bombs are hitting and schools are being wiped out.
[00:37:04.140 --> 00:37:05.300]   Hospitals being wiped out.
[00:37:05.300 --> 00:37:06.300]   Banks are being gone.
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:12.620]   Whole neighborhoods, whole cities are being wiped out through this war.
[00:37:12.620 --> 00:37:16.100]   Everything that they worked for, everything that they hoped for, everything that they
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:23.700]   built instantaneously is going up in flames.
[00:37:23.700 --> 00:37:30.460]   And as much as we are sorrowful for what we are seeing physically, the book of Revelation
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:35.220]   tells us that this is going to happen worldwide.
[00:37:35.220 --> 00:37:37.180]   We all know this 100%.
[00:37:37.180 --> 00:37:38.220]   Maybe Russia may not come in.
[00:37:38.220 --> 00:37:40.060]   Maybe it may not be China.
[00:37:40.060 --> 00:37:44.420]   But whatever it is, the Bible says that it is going to happen.
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:45.420]   100%.
[00:37:45.420 --> 00:37:51.220]   So if the Ukrainians knew that the Russians was going to come in and the hospitals and
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:57.820]   the things that they valued so much was going to be wiped out by one bomb, would that have
[00:37:57.820 --> 00:38:00.140]   changed their perspective?
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:01.580]   What they pursued?
[00:38:01.580 --> 00:38:03.620]   What they invested in?
[00:38:03.620 --> 00:38:05.100]   What they built?
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:08.380]   Yeah, most likely.
[00:38:08.380 --> 00:38:10.940]   What about us?
[00:38:10.940 --> 00:38:15.180]   There's a reason why the Bible says not to build your house upon sand.
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:20.300]   Because as soon as the breath of God comes, it will all be wiped out.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:21.980]   It doesn't matter how big your house is.
[00:38:21.980 --> 00:38:23.860]   It doesn't matter how much you saved up.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:26.980]   It doesn't matter what neighborhood.
[00:38:26.980 --> 00:38:30.140]   Once it comes, all will be gone.
[00:38:30.140 --> 00:38:36.940]   So as Christians who believe that He saved us, He saved us of an empty way of life, recognizing
[00:38:36.940 --> 00:38:43.220]   that everything, all human beings, everything that we value, like grass, like flowers, in
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:46.280]   the moment seems so tempting.
[00:38:46.280 --> 00:38:48.900]   In the moment, it seems so attractive.
[00:38:48.900 --> 00:38:54.380]   But when the testing comes, will it stand the test of time?
[00:38:54.380 --> 00:39:02.260]   It is only reasonable, only reasonable thing that a believer in Christ would do is to invest
[00:39:02.260 --> 00:39:06.620]   in things that will last in eternity.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:13.900]   That when the day comes and all that we value, all that we are tempted about ends, what will
[00:39:13.900 --> 00:39:15.780]   remain?
[00:39:15.780 --> 00:39:20.020]   Or will we be looking back like Lot's wife?
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:23.020]   Everything that I've invested in is back there.
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:26.020]   So he says to call out, call out.
[00:39:26.020 --> 00:39:34.540]   And then he says in Isaiah 49-10, "Get yourself up on a mountain, O Zion, bear up good news.
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:37.500]   Lift up your voice, O mighty Jerusalem, bear up good news.
[00:39:37.500 --> 00:39:38.740]   Lift it up, do not fear.
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.060]   Say to the cities of Judah, 'Here is your God.
[00:39:41.060 --> 00:39:45.540]   Behold, the Lord God will come with might, with His arm ruling for Him.
[00:39:45.540 --> 00:39:49.220]   Behold, His reward is with Him and His recompense before Him.'"
[00:39:49.220 --> 00:39:54.860]   If you knew that Jesus was coming tomorrow, how will that change your perspective?
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:59.940]   I know for a fact, if I knew that I only had one more day, the only thing that I would
[00:39:59.940 --> 00:40:05.380]   be concerned about are the people that I need to tell about Jesus.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:10.740]   And I believe you will agree with me 100%, that if you knew that you only had a day to
[00:40:10.740 --> 00:40:14.060]   live, you're not going to be concerned about your neighborhood, you're not going to be
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.740]   concerned about your job.
[00:40:15.740 --> 00:40:20.140]   The only thing that you're going to be concerned about are the people who do not know Christ.
[00:40:20.140 --> 00:40:26.180]   So therefore, he says, recognize, cry out, recognize who we are, recognize that only
[00:40:26.180 --> 00:40:28.620]   He has things that have eternal value.
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:35.220]   And if you recognize that, stand up on a mountaintop and proclaim to the other people the hope
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:38.180]   that is in Jesus Christ.
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:47.620]   My prayer is, as we prepare for the resurrection, His suffering, that we don't just pass this
[00:40:47.620 --> 00:40:54.060]   by like just another holiday, that we would use this time to recalibrate our hearts, our
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:41:00.540]   mind, our thoughts, and prioritize what ought to be priority, to major on the major and
[00:41:00.540 --> 00:41:03.380]   minor on the minor.
[00:41:03.380 --> 00:41:08.100]   If we've had that value flipped upside down, where we're majoring on the minor and minoring
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:13.620]   on the major, maybe this is a time for us to recalibrate, to consider deeply where we're
[00:41:13.620 --> 00:41:15.980]   standing before God.
[00:41:15.980 --> 00:41:21.540]   And as Isaiah says in chapter 40, 27, "Why do you say, 'O Jacob,' and assert, 'O Israel,
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:27.020]   my way is hidden from the Lord, and the justice due me escapes the notice of my God?'"
[00:41:27.020 --> 00:41:28.020]   Meaning where are you?
[00:41:28.020 --> 00:41:30.820]   How come you're not answering?
[00:41:30.820 --> 00:41:35.300]   It seems like you could say all of this stuff, but where is he?
[00:41:35.300 --> 00:41:40.980]   God answers in 28, "Do you not know, have you not heard, the everlasting God, the Lord,
[00:41:40.980 --> 00:41:44.860]   the creator of the ends of the earth, does not become weary or tired.
[00:41:44.860 --> 00:41:46.700]   His understanding is inscrutable.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:51.820]   He gives strength to the weary, and to him who lacks might, he increases power.
[00:41:51.820 --> 00:41:57.620]   Though youth grow weary and tired, and vigorous young men stumble badly, those who wait for
[00:41:57.620 --> 00:41:59.300]   the Lord."
[00:41:59.300 --> 00:42:02.860]   To wait is not just to passively sit and to see what God's going to do.
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:06.460]   Wait, meaning that you recognize that our refuge is in him.
[00:42:06.460 --> 00:42:08.900]   You recognize that our strength is in him.
[00:42:08.900 --> 00:42:11.300]   You recognize our hope is in him.
[00:42:11.300 --> 00:42:14.220]   And you recognize that our life is in him.
[00:42:14.220 --> 00:42:15.700]   That's what it means.
[00:42:15.700 --> 00:42:19.740]   Those who wait for the Lord will gain new strength.
[00:42:19.740 --> 00:42:21.900]   They will mount up with wings like eagles.
[00:42:21.900 --> 00:42:23.460]   They will run and not get tired.
[00:42:23.460 --> 00:42:27.460]   They will walk and not become weary.
[00:42:27.460 --> 00:42:35.660]   So as we are headed toward Easter and more and more people are searching, I pray that
[00:42:35.660 --> 00:42:44.140]   this would be for all of us to calibrate our hearts, to anchor ourselves with Christ, and
[00:42:44.140 --> 00:42:47.300]   to really cry out.
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:52.380]   As much as many of you are watching television and seeing the Ukrainians and some of you
[00:42:52.380 --> 00:43:00.420]   in tears because you see the suffering of these people, whatever your politics may be,
[00:43:00.420 --> 00:43:06.500]   that Ukrainians have incited compassion in your heart.
[00:43:06.500 --> 00:43:13.020]   That's why we were able to collect $47,000, because you want to do something.
[00:43:13.020 --> 00:43:19.500]   As much as you have compassion for those who are physically suffering, I pray that God
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:27.580]   would open our eyes to see those who are in spiritual poverty, that they are just as bad
[00:43:27.580 --> 00:43:35.900]   in situation, that we would kneel before the Lord pleading on their behalf, that however
[00:43:35.900 --> 00:43:41.380]   life that he has given us, however long this life may be, that I would use that time to
[00:43:41.380 --> 00:43:46.900]   tell as many people as possible that Christ is a compassionate God.
[00:43:46.900 --> 00:43:49.220]   He's a loving God.
[00:43:49.220 --> 00:43:52.560]   And invite them to know this Lord as well.
[00:43:52.560 --> 00:43:57.740]   As we ask our praise team to come up, let's take some time to pray.
[00:43:57.740 --> 00:44:06.120]   Again, if our hearts have strayed, to confess that before the Lord.
[00:44:06.120 --> 00:44:10.500]   If you've just accepted lukewarmness and whatever lukewarmness kind of leads to, and you just
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:17.900]   accepted that, just like Hezekiah, you have no idea where this is headed, the fruits that
[00:44:17.900 --> 00:44:26.100]   it will bear on you, on your children, to come before the Lord, to really come before
[00:44:26.100 --> 00:44:28.580]   the Lord and ask, "Lord, soften my heart.
[00:44:28.580 --> 00:44:29.580]   You are the powder.
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:31.220]   I am the clay.
[00:44:31.220 --> 00:44:37.820]   Let your word convict me, guide me, renew me, that everything that I profess to believe
[00:44:37.820 --> 00:44:41.900]   is exactly the way that I respond to you, that I may worship you in spirit and in truth."
[00:44:41.900 --> 00:44:44.500]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:54.500]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
