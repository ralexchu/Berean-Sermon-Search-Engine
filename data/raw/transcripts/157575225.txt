[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this evening.
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   We pray, Lord God, that you would bless our time together.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Help us to gather our thoughts and our hearts, Lord,
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   that we may be focused and that your word would truly speak to us this evening.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   Alright, so if you turn your Bibles to Isaiah 24 and 25.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   Alright, let me just ask you real quick, and you guys can yell it out
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   or you guys can say to each other,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   how would you label these two chapters?
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   What's a running theme that you kind of see?
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   Judgment?
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Apocalyptic?
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Okay. End times?
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Okay.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   How is it different than the previous chapters?
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   [inaudible]
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   Okay. The scope of the judgment is not limited to one nation or particular, right?
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   It's more broad.
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   Do you notice anything else that's different?
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   [inaudible]
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   Okay. So there's language of restoration mixed in.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   Okay. Alright, so hopefully you were able to catch that.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   And those of you who weren't with us before, obviously you don't have anything to compare with.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   But up to chapter 23, the judgment was, for the most part, very specific to particular nations,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   particular things going on.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   If you look at chapter 24 to probably about chapter 27, the judgment is very broad.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   It's not talking to a specific nation or particular event in history necessarily.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   Although that may be an application, but you see a much more broader apocalyptic,
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:36.000]   where the judgment is upon the whole earth, all the nations, all the people.
[00:02:36.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And the other part of it is, it gives you the conclusion of it, right?
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:44.000]   Where previously we've seen judgment upon the nations,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   and then it's kind of like on a side note or in between.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   You say, "Well, the Messiah is going to come. The Messiah is going to come."
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   But here it's almost kind of like the judgment is complete, right?
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's not like, "Here's a judgment. It's going to wait and we'll see what happens."
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   It's like, "This is the end part."
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   So what David said about apocalyptic, where it's like the end, right?
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   And then when the end comes, there's something else that comes.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Rejoicing, praising, glorifying, worshipping, right?
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:18.000]   So what does that remind us of? What other part of the Bible does that remind us of?
[00:03:18.000 --> 00:03:22.000]   Revelation, right? So you look at the book of Revelation,
[00:03:22.000 --> 00:03:26.000]   it's not talking about just one particular part. It's talking about the very end, right?
[00:03:26.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   So you kind of have the… So it's talking about judgment,
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   but that's what's a little bit different from the previous verses versus this one, okay?
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So keep that in mind. The first section of it, verse…
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   Where is it? Verse 1 to 3, or 1 to 5, right?
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   It's, again, emphasis on the scope of the judgment.
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   All right. Okay.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   All right, so Thursday, verses 1 through 6.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   How is God's judgment depicted in Isaiah?
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   God judged through Assyria, but now He's judging through natural disaster.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   It doesn't mention anything in particular,
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   but again, if you look at the language in verse 1,
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   where the earth is kind of turned upside down, maybe an earthquake, maybe a tornado.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   And then if you look at verse 4, right, it talks about how the earth mourns and it withers and it languishes.
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So if you look at the language of, you know, like the harvest drying out and no more wine,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   it kind of gives you the picture of some kind of a drought and there's no harvest, right?
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   So again, the judgment is not just one particular nation,
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   another nation is going to come and conquer you.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.000]   It's a worldwide judgment, right?
[00:04:39.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So the natural disaster is not just happening in one place.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So again, what does that sound like?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Book of Revelation, right?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   The very end times.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   So again, this is not a fact, but again, the language kind of points to some kind of natural disaster or disasters.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   So again, verse 2, it talks about the scope of judgment, right?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   We talked about that, how if you look at verse 2, it says,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   "And it shall be as with the people, so with the priests, as with the slaves, so with the master, as with the maids, so with the mistress."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So on and on and on, saying that no one's going to be spared from the highest to the low.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   Businessmen and people who are lenders and borrowers, creditors and debtors.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And then the conclusion of that in verse 3, so they're going to be orderly, right?
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So this is, you know, I would say maybe not.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   The language itself may have been toned down, but if you look at what it actually says,
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   actually the judgment is much greater than what he was saying before.
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   Before it was like, the other nation's going to come, take you captive, you're not going to have any men around,
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   you're going to have lack of leadership.
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   Where he describes it as order destruction, right?
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Again, you look at the Book of Revelation, the judgment is not something specific.
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   When a third of the world is being wiped out, that's not a particular nation or particular area.
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   It's talking about massive, right?
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   Either natural disaster or some kind of war, so everybody's going to be affected.
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:12.000]   And so that's the judgment that we see here, where the whole earth is judged, right?
[00:06:12.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   So the devastation is complete and absolutely thorough.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   If you don't have the sheets to fill out somewhere, it should be sitting around somewhere.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   Okay? Yeah, so if you have extra, can you raise your hand? And if you don't have it, raise your hand.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:35.000]   Okay, everybody has extra. So if you don't have it, just walk around and you should be able to find it.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   Okay?
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   On your sheet, I have, again in verse 4, the earth mourns and withers, world languishes and withers.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   And again, the people who are high are going to be brought low.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And then on your sheet, it has verse 3, but that's not supposed to be there, so just kind of cross that out.
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   I printed it before I was able to cross that out.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   So again, the emphasis in the scope of destruction, right?
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   Who's the earth referring to? That was one of the questions that I asked.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   If you want to say it out loud, you can, or just...
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   Okay, everyone?
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   Is it talking about people? Is it talking about the physical earth?
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   Is it talking about Israel? Is it talking about a specific nation?
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   So there's a distinction between the earth and the people.
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   Right, okay.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   So, yes, so I think, again if you look at the language, and if you look at verse 5 also,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   it says that the earth lies defiled under its inhabitants,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   meaning that there's a distinction between the people and the earth, right?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   So I think it's referring to both. So if you read it carefully,
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   the way that the word earth is mentioned, it's talking about just complete devastation,
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   creation and everybody in it, right?
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   And the reason why is because of sin.
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   So the earth seems to refer to the physical earth and the people in it.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   The scope of devastation is going to be absolutely thorough.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:38.000]   And this is going to affect everybody, everywhere.
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Where the previous judgments were very specific to a particular nation because of a particular sin,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   where this here, the sin is in a larger scale.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   So what was the earth guilty of?
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   What was the earth guilty of?
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   It's defiled by its people.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   The people abused, basically the people abused the earth, right?
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   So there's several things that it mentions. It's transgressed the laws.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   Again, when we're talking about earth, we're talking about everybody, all mankind, right?
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:28.000]   Just like it says in Romans 3, 23, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   So here, when it says earth, it's referring to everything, right?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:40.000]   So what he says in this verse in verse 5, basically he says three separate things, right?
[00:09:40.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   He transgressed the law. What else does he say?
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Okay. And then the other one?
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   Violated the statutes. Okay, if you're looking at the ESV.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   So, is there a distinction between these three?
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:11.000]   Is there a distinction between these three?
[00:10:11.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   I won't grade you, it's okay if you're wrong.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   (Audience) Is there an escalation from law to statutes to the Ecumenical Covenant?
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   It seems like it, right? It's probably referring to the same thing,
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   but it just kind of seems like there's an escalation, a greater degree.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   And why would Isaiah do that, or why would God prophesy that way?
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   For what purpose?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   Emphasis, right? And then the fact that it's done three separate times,
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and any time the number three comes, you know that it's for the purpose of confirmation, right?
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   Witnesses of two or three, Jesus was resurrected on the third day, right?
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   The Trinity. So, it's a number of confirmation, and you see that escalation three separate times.
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   And so, up to this point, remember the theme?
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:04.000]   That the whole point of this section is kind of order destruction,
[00:11:04.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   complete destruction, complete judgment for all people, right? Everywhere, including the earth.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So, here's, again, just the technical nuances of transgressed is their greed.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   They broke God's covenant, violated the statues, altered or broken God's covenant,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   broken an everlasting covenant, annulled or nullified the covenant made with God, right?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   And as a result of that, only a few are left, right?
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   The devastation is going to be so great that it's not just one nation,
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   but all the earth, after the judgment is done, only a few are left.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:50.000]   If you are a dispensationalist, again, if you don't know what that word is,
[00:11:50.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   you don't need to worry too much about it, but what in the Bible teaches this?
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   That after a great period of something, that so many people are going to die,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   only a few are going to remain at the end.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   What theology in the Bible that talks about, like, judgment in such a large scale,
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   and so many people dying, that at the end of it, few people are going to remain?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   Well, rapture, we're all gone.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Tribulation, right? During the period of tribulation.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   If you read the Book of Revelations, there's three separate judgments, right?
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   The bowl judgment, the trumpet judgment, the seal judgment,
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   and each of these judgments kind of escalates one at a time.
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   So, there's different interpretation of these judgments,
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   but in the end, basically it's talking about the thoroughness,
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   and the utter devastation that it's going to bring,
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   and at the end of that, so the first three and a half is harsh,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:56.000]   and then the next three and a half years is utter devastation,
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:13:00.000]   and at the end of that, a few are going to come out of it, right?
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   So, is this referring to that? I mean, it's an educated guess,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   but the language seems very similar.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Okay. Again, these couple of verses are talking about the creation being judged.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   It says, "For the creation waits with eager longing for the revealing of the Son of God.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   For the creation was subjected to futility, not willingly, but because of Him who subjected it,
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   in hope that the creation itself will be set free from its bondage to decay,
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:28.000]   and obtain the freedom and the glory of the children of God."
[00:13:28.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   So again, when the scripture describes when Adam and Eve fell,
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:36.000]   that the earth itself was cursed, remember?
[00:13:36.000 --> 00:13:40.000]   And he said that part of the curse was that before, he would work,
[00:13:40.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   and then they were going to bear fruit, but because of the fall in Romans 3,
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:47.000]   that it's going to produce thorns and thistles.
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   And then we look at the Book of Romans when it talks about the restoration,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.000]   he says that part of the restoration is not just the human being,
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   but everything that is attached to the human being, right?
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And if you look at Chronicles, in Exodus 23, 10 through 11,
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   God gives a commandment to the nation of Israel
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   that the land is supposed to rest every seventh year, right?
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   That not only the mankind, but the land, they weren't supposed to till the land
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   seven years in a row. After the sixth year, they're supposed to give it a rest seventh year.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   If you look at 2 Chronicles 36, 21, and then there's passages in Deuteronomy,
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   where again, these are commandments of giving rest,
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   but at the end, when the Babylonians come and take them into captivity,
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   the reason why, one of the reasons why they're taken into captivity,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:39.000]   what God says, is because you did not obey my commandment to obey the Sabbath,
[00:14:39.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   and in particular, the land. And then he says the reason why they're there for 70 years
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   is for every year that they disobey, they're giving it,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   God's giving it the rest that they didn't give.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Okay? So again, the significance of disobedience to the Sabbath
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   is related to the human beings, but also related to the creation.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   Okay? So there's a whole theology based on this, about the new earth and new creation.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   I'm not going to get into that, but again, the reason I'm pointing this out
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   is because the language is similar. Okay?
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   So that's the first section.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   The first section, chapter 24, verses 1 through 6, is
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   trying to convey the utter devastation, right?
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   And how it's going to affect everybody. Only a few are going to remain.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   If you go to the second part, starting from Friday, verses 7 through 16,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   what is the difference in this section?
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   Which we already mentioned, but to be more specific.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   There's a glimpse of hope, right?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Where the first section is just making sure that you understand that when the judgment comes,
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   this is, you know, no one's going to be spared, very few are going to come out of it,
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   and yet, there's some glimmer of hope.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   So what is the fruit of the judgment? Okay?
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   It says it's going to devastate life
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   in every way. So if you look at verse 7,
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:17.000]   the wine mourns and the vine languishes
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   and all the merry hearted sigh, right?
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   Why would the wine mourn and vine languish?
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Think about what he said in the previous verse.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:37.000]   Huh?
[00:16:37.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   Because of the famine, right? Because of the judgment.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   And so this kind of describes the…
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   (microphone feedback)
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   I need to invest in a better mic.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   Alright, so…
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:09.000]   Yeah, so the language sounds like that because of this famine, it's going to
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   devastate everybody, that there is no fruit to enjoy, right?
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   So, the description of the judgment, verse 7, the source of joy
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   is going to be dried out, meaning that if there's no harvest, there's no wine, there's nothing
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   flowing, then there's no celebration.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Source of joy. It ends with the experience of joy, verse 8 and 9.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   The mirth of the tambourines are still, the noise of the jubilant has ceased,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   and the mirth of the lyre is still. No more do they drink wine with singing,
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   strong drink is bitter to those who drink it. So in other words, because there is
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   no harvest, the source of joy has been dried up, and now
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   there's no celebration. And all, this is all as a result of sin,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   right? So, obviously it's talking about
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   particular things that's going to happen when judgment comes, but generally speaking,
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   it is a picture of a life in sin, right?
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   When there is sin and you're away from God, that the source of joy,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   which is Christ, who is the living water, when He gets dried out,
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   when life gets dried out, then joy gets dried out, right?
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   And then verse 11, there's an utter banishment of joy,
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   verse 11, there is an outcry in the streets for lack of wine, all joy
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   has grown dark, completely, right?
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   And then verse 10, it causes the city to lie ruined and defenseless.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   So the first section
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   describes judgment coming, right? What is this judgment going to look like?
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Devastation, natural disaster. Who's going to come on?
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   Creation, all of the people, right?
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   Physical and the people, right?
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Because of their violation, because they transgressed the law, because they
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   broken the covenant, and as a result of that, only a few are going to come. And because of this
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   judgment, joy is going to be sucked out, right? There's going to be no celebration,
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   and they're going to be utterly helpless. But what does
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   the judgment ultimately lead to, and why?
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   We already talked about that. This section, there's judgment, but then there's
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   glimmers of hope. So we hear language, it is kind of a
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   strange place to hear this language, because it's talking about probably
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   up to this point, the greatest intensity of judgment,
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   but it's intermingled with rejoicing, right?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   So it's kind of out of place, it's like, oh, you know, you're completely
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   devastating the land, and as a result of that, it leads to
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   praising, right? So who is this that's rejoicing? Why are they rejoicing?
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:45.000]   For what?
[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   Okay. The people who are rejoicing are the remnant,
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   the few that are mentioned in verse 6, right? After the judgment
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   comes, what it's going to produce is
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   that the people who come out of that, and they're going to see God's
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   glory, one, that they were able to escape that, in other words,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   that God spared them through this judgment, right? But secondly,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:13.000]   that they saw God's power, and all of a sudden they become greater worshippers.
[00:20:13.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   So these few break out into
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   glorifying, praising. There's greater love for Christ,
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   greater glory as a result of that. So in one sense
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   the devastation is leading to destruction, the other sense it also brings revival.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   Right?
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   So as the world was judged, the whole
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:41.000]   earth, and the language again describes it, the west, the east, the end of the earth
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:45.000]   will rejoice and give Him. So these are all, everybody who has seen
[00:20:45.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   that, and has kind of made it out of it, and the few remnant
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   that remains, they will see God as He is, and it
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:57.000]   will ultimately lead to them giving God the glory from all over. So again,
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   this revival and praise isn't just coming from one group of people.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   Right? Just as devastation was worldwide, the praise
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and glory and worship and rejoicing is also going to be worldwide.
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   [pause]
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   Again, in Revelation 21, again, just because the language
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   is similar, "By His light will the nations walk, and the kings of the earth will bring
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   their glory into it, and its gates will never be shut by day, and there will be no
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   night there. They will bring into it the glory and the
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   honor of all the nations." Again, the language is very similar
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   to the book of Revelations.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   [pause]
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   You guys following so far?
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Again, if you,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   in the midst of that, let me go back.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   25,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   or 24,
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   [pause]
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   Okay, look at verse 24, 16.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   So, he talks about utter devastation, and as a result
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:21.000]   of that, there's going to be a remnant who's going to go praise God,
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:25.000]   and revival breaks out. But in verse 16,
[00:22:25.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   it says, "I waste away, I waste away, woe to me, for the
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   traitors have betrayed, with betrayal the traitors have betrayed." Who is the "I" here?
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:37.000]   And why is he mourning?
[00:22:37.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   [pause]
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Take a minute to discuss with your group, okay? Who is the
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   "I" in that text, and why is that person mourning? Because
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   right before that, it talked about rejoicing and revival.
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:59.000]   [pause]
[00:22:59.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   Okay.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   Take an educated guess.
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   [pause]

[00:27:08.080 --> 00:27:08.880]   Sounds good.

[00:27:16.880 --> 00:27:17.880]   >> Okay, I mean,
[00:27:17.880 --> 00:27:22.080]   do you guys all agree that it sounds like this is Isaiah, right?
[00:27:22.080 --> 00:27:24.880]   You won't even shake your head, okay?
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:25.680]   >> [INAUDIBLE]
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:26.180]   >> Huh?
[00:27:26.180 --> 00:27:28.680]   >> Who are the traitors?
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:32.080]   >> I think that judgment is referring to all mankind, so
[00:27:32.080 --> 00:27:37.280]   I would assume that he's referring not just to one particular group, yeah.
[00:27:37.280 --> 00:27:39.480]   The whole earth has fallen apart.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:42.180]   So Isaiah is seeing a, again,
[00:27:42.180 --> 00:27:46.980]   Isaiah is seeing something that's gonna happen in the future, right?
[00:27:46.980 --> 00:27:50.680]   Isaiah is prophesying about, he's not talking about specifically just then.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.980]   He's talking about Babylon's not even a superpower yet.
[00:27:53.980 --> 00:27:56.880]   He's talking about Babylon, the Persians, and he's talking about the end times.
[00:27:56.880 --> 00:27:59.980]   So he's seeing in the future the devastation is coming.
[00:27:59.980 --> 00:28:04.280]   So at the end of that devastation there's glory, but
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:06.980]   before that glory comes he's seeing all this stuff.
[00:28:06.980 --> 00:28:10.580]   I mean, everything that he's seen prior to that is gonna be nothing compared to
[00:28:10.580 --> 00:28:11.580]   what's happening at the end.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:15.380]   So what it seems like is that even though there's a mixture of,
[00:28:15.380 --> 00:28:17.680]   like when we talk about the second coming of Christ,
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:21.880]   depending on who you are and your perspective, you're gonna rejoice or mourn.
[00:28:21.880 --> 00:28:25.280]   Even as a Christian, you're gonna rejoice or mourn.
[00:28:25.280 --> 00:28:28.380]   At one sense, you're gonna rejoice because he's coming.
[00:28:28.380 --> 00:28:31.780]   And in another sense, you're gonna mourn because judgment is coming with him,
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:32.480]   right?
[00:28:32.480 --> 00:28:35.680]   So you're gonna rejoice because your suffering's gonna end.
[00:28:35.680 --> 00:28:40.780]   You're gonna mourn because suffering for people that you love, right?
[00:28:40.780 --> 00:28:42.680]   It may just begin.
[00:28:42.680 --> 00:28:50.880]   So the coming of Christ in his full glory is gonna bring salvation and condemnation.
[00:28:50.880 --> 00:28:53.680]   And so that's what Isaiah is seeing all of it.
[00:28:53.680 --> 00:28:58.580]   So you kinda see in his prophecy, he's mixed with rejoicing and
[00:28:58.580 --> 00:29:01.280]   mourning and rejoicing and mourning all at the same time.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.380]   Because he's not at this end where he's experienced all of this and
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.480]   he's like, now it's rejoicing.
[00:29:05.480 --> 00:29:07.680]   He's seeing all of it's gonna happen, right?
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:12.080]   So what will happen to those?
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:14.580]   Again, he's going back.
[00:29:14.580 --> 00:29:19.080]   He's mourning and he's seeing all this terror and the pit and
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.280]   the snare upon you, all inhabitants, right?
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:27.680]   The temptation that they may give into is a deliberate snare or a trap, right?
[00:29:27.680 --> 00:29:28.880]   And there's gonna be no escape.
[00:29:28.880 --> 00:29:30.780]   And those who escape are gonna fall into a pit.
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:33.380]   Again, the emphasis over and over and over again,
[00:29:33.380 --> 00:29:35.880]   that there is no escape for this judgment.
[00:29:35.880 --> 00:29:40.280]   Book of Revelation says when he comes, that those who did not know him are gonna
[00:29:40.280 --> 00:29:45.180]   climb up to the mountains and hide under rocks, but there is no escape, right?
[00:29:45.180 --> 00:29:54.080]   So when the earth is shaken and the moon and the sun disgraced,
[00:29:54.080 --> 00:29:56.480]   what will the Lord do, right?
[00:29:56.480 --> 00:30:01.680]   Again, in verse 19, it says, the earth is utterly broken.
[00:30:01.680 --> 00:30:03.180]   The earth is split apart.
[00:30:03.180 --> 00:30:04.580]   The earth is violently shaken.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:08.180]   Again, so it sounds like some kind of natural disaster.
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:13.380]   And over and over again, it's gonna be utter destruction, right?
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:14.680]   The depth of sins of the nation.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:19.380]   The kings on earth will be punished, right?
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:24.080]   And all of this is gonna happen as a result of his glory being revealed.
[00:30:24.080 --> 00:30:27.380]   So if you look at the very last verse in 23, he says,
[00:30:27.380 --> 00:30:29.780]   "And the moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed,
[00:30:29.780 --> 00:30:32.280]   for the Lord of hosts reigns on Mount Zion,
[00:30:32.280 --> 00:30:35.080]   and in Jerusalem in his glory will be before his elders."
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:39.980]   So when God's glory is fully revealed, it will have two responses.
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:44.980]   For those who have been covered by the blood of Christ, you are safe, right?
[00:30:44.980 --> 00:30:49.780]   Just like when even the Old Testament is saying when Isaiah or even John
[00:30:49.780 --> 00:30:54.680]   at the throne of God's throne, you know, it said, "Woe is me, woe is me," right?
[00:30:54.680 --> 00:30:57.680]   Because they feel terror in his presence.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:01.480]   So remember we talked about the propitiation is basically
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:05.280]   covering over God's wrath that you and I deserve by the blood of Christ.
[00:31:05.280 --> 00:31:09.080]   So those of us who've been clothed by the righteousness of Christ,
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:15.780]   when his glory comes, it means we're drawing near to life, right?
[00:31:15.780 --> 00:31:17.980]   But those who have not been covered by the blood of Christ,
[00:31:17.980 --> 00:31:21.980]   when his glory comes, it means condemnation, fear, and terror.
[00:31:21.980 --> 00:31:24.480]   And so that's how it's described in verse 23.
[00:31:24.480 --> 00:31:28.480]   His glory is going to be so magnificent, right?
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:31.280]   He says, "The moon will be confounded and the sun ashamed."
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:34.280]   Why would they be confounded and the sun ashamed?
[00:31:34.280 --> 00:31:36.680]   S-U-N, not S-O-N.
[00:31:36.680 --> 00:31:42.180]   Oh, is it too low? All right.
[00:31:42.180 --> 00:31:45.880]   Is it because of that or is it just too low?
[00:31:45.880 --> 00:31:48.380]   Because of that? All right.
[00:31:48.380 --> 00:31:53.880]   So if I move that, you guys can see it?
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.380]   Huh?
[00:31:57.380 --> 00:32:01.880]   You want me to do more work? I'm already tired.
[00:32:01.880 --> 00:32:02.880]   I'm just kidding. Okay.
[00:32:02.880 --> 00:32:06.580]   I just wanted to know so next time I just don't do it this low.
[00:32:06.580 --> 00:32:10.580]   Okay? Huh?
[00:32:10.580 --> 00:32:14.180]   You want me to move that too now? You want me to read it and move it?
[00:32:14.180 --> 00:32:18.880]   All right. His glory will be before his elders.
[00:32:18.880 --> 00:32:21.180]   Actually, what I was saying is actually not up there.
[00:32:21.180 --> 00:32:26.880]   So why is the moon confounded and the sun ashamed?
[00:32:26.880 --> 00:32:30.180]   S-So the moon and the sun are known for giving out light, right?
[00:32:30.180 --> 00:32:33.380]   When Christ comes and He reigns, He will shine so brilliantly
[00:32:33.380 --> 00:32:38.880]   that He's going to cause basically anything else in the universe to feel ashamed in comparison.
[00:32:38.880 --> 00:32:40.180]   Did you get that?
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:42.180]   So His glory is going to be so magnificent
[00:32:42.180 --> 00:32:45.880]   that the moon and the sun are going to be embarrassed in the presence of its glory.
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:47.880]   Right?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.180]   You see, like you throw your big shot in the basketball court
[00:32:50.180 --> 00:32:54.180]   and then Stephen Curry shows up being like, "Oh!"
[00:32:54.180 --> 00:32:55.180]   Right?
[00:32:55.180 --> 00:32:56.880]   So that's verse 23.
[00:32:56.880 --> 00:33:01.880]   When He reveals His glory, that everybody who thought that He were glorious
[00:33:01.880 --> 00:33:04.380]   are going to be confounded and embarrassed.
[00:33:04.380 --> 00:33:05.180]   Right?
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:07.680]   That's how magnificent His glory is going to be.
[00:33:07.680 --> 00:33:09.980]   Right?
[00:33:09.980 --> 00:33:15.880]   And so, how does Isaiah describe this judgment?
[00:33:15.880 --> 00:33:18.180]   Again, remember I told you like back and forth, back and forth.
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:22.680]   So he sees His glory coming, he sees the judgment and he mourns.
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.180]   But then he also sees the glory in verse 1, chapter 25.
[00:33:26.180 --> 00:33:30.180]   What does he, how does he describe it?
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:36.680]   What version are you using?
[00:33:36.680 --> 00:33:40.680]   NIV. Does NIV say faithful and…
[00:33:40.680 --> 00:33:41.680]   What?
[00:33:41.680 --> 00:33:46.680]   Oh, OK, OK, bottom line. OK.
[00:33:46.680 --> 00:33:51.680]   Alright. I got wonderful.
[00:33:51.680 --> 00:33:53.680]   He calls it wonderful.
[00:33:53.680 --> 00:33:56.680]   So you would think that, he says, "Oh, you've done some wonderful things."
[00:33:56.680 --> 00:33:58.680]   And then in verse 2, he breaks out and says,
[00:33:58.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   "Because you wiped out the heap, fortified city, ruins, foreigners, palaces, and cities."
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:06.180]   And all of that is completely gone, right?
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:10.680]   To never be rebuilt and then he sees that as wonderful.
[00:34:10.680 --> 00:34:13.180]   Right?
[00:34:13.180 --> 00:34:18.680]   Again, because I think what Isaiah is seeing is His glory.
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:19.680]   Right?
[00:34:19.680 --> 00:34:21.180]   Isaiah is seeing His glory.
[00:34:21.180 --> 00:34:26.680]   So there is a beauty of His glory, but there's also terror in His glory.
[00:34:26.680 --> 00:34:27.680]   Right?
[00:34:27.680 --> 00:34:29.680]   And so he sees it back and forth.
[00:34:29.680 --> 00:34:32.680]   Those two things can never be separated.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:36.680]   God's terror and His grace are never separated.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:37.680]   Right?
[00:34:37.680 --> 00:34:40.680]   So when you look at the cross, the cross…
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:44.680]   I mean, obviously for us, when we look at the cross, we see redemption, we see love.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:51.680]   But for the world, the cross, if understood correctly, should also produce terror.
[00:34:51.680 --> 00:34:52.680]   Right?
[00:34:52.680 --> 00:35:00.680]   If you look at that and say, "Well, God's holiness is so devastating that the only way to redeem us from sin
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:07.680]   is that God Himself, Son of God Himself, have to absorb our sins and that's how terrible His wrath was or is."
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:10.680]   So the cross is not just something that produces warm feelings.
[00:35:10.680 --> 00:35:17.680]   It's also the greatest magnification of His terror.
[00:35:17.680 --> 00:35:18.680]   Right?
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:22.680]   Remember we talked about that when Dr. Harris came and talked about darkness and the glory,
[00:35:22.680 --> 00:35:25.680]   where God wasn't turning away.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:32.680]   He was actually approaching His Son, right, to put the wrath upon Him.
[00:35:32.680 --> 00:35:33.680]   Right?
[00:35:33.680 --> 00:35:39.680]   And remember in every situation that he talked about, when God comes to ratify a covenant,
[00:35:39.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   He puts people to sleep because they can't stand before His glory.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   So when did God… when was God the most magnified at that time?
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.680]   When did God actually appear?
[00:35:50.680 --> 00:35:56.680]   You know, again, we think about that scene when it goes dark and people say, "Oh, He turned away because He couldn't see."
[00:35:56.680 --> 00:36:00.680]   In actuality, remember, Dr. Harris was seeing that.
[00:36:00.680 --> 00:36:02.680]   I think he did a great job explaining that to us.
[00:36:02.680 --> 00:36:06.680]   That it makes more sense that He actually was drawing near, not drawing out.
[00:36:06.680 --> 00:36:09.680]   Because He had to ratify that covenant and He had to do it.
[00:36:09.680 --> 00:36:10.680]   Right?
[00:36:10.680 --> 00:36:18.680]   So His terrifying presence, because He was coming, had to be darkened or else everybody in there would be devastated.
[00:36:18.680 --> 00:36:19.680]   Right?
[00:36:19.680 --> 00:36:26.680]   So again, we're looking at Him coming and He looks at His glory and He sees wonder.
[00:36:26.680 --> 00:36:27.680]   Oops.
[00:36:27.680 --> 00:36:34.680]   Did I do that?
[00:36:34.680 --> 00:36:37.680]   Oh, it's just that.
[00:36:37.680 --> 00:36:41.680]   There's no way to fix that.
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.680]   Is that because the connection?
[00:36:44.680 --> 00:36:50.680]   Joe?
[00:36:50.680 --> 00:36:56.680]   So what's…
[00:36:56.680 --> 00:37:05.680]   So the next question is…
[00:37:05.680 --> 00:37:13.680]   Did you mess with the connection?
[00:37:13.680 --> 00:37:21.680]   So we can't fix it.
[00:37:21.680 --> 00:37:30.680]   But that sometimes happens even during worship.
[00:37:30.680 --> 00:37:34.680]   So we can't fix it.
[00:37:34.680 --> 00:37:42.680]   Alright.
[00:37:42.680 --> 00:37:45.680]   So Isaiah calls God's judgment wonderful.
[00:37:45.680 --> 00:37:49.680]   These are plans that God had from of old.
[00:37:49.680 --> 00:37:52.680]   Okay.
[00:37:52.680 --> 00:37:59.680]   What did this judgment accomplish that has Isaiah praising Him?
[00:37:59.680 --> 00:38:03.680]   It says God has led the strong people to glorify God.
[00:38:03.680 --> 00:38:12.680]   It's like God basically takes all the successful, proud people of power, of influence that He's going to humble and He's going to turn it upside down.
[00:38:12.680 --> 00:38:14.680]   And then all of them will submit to Him.
[00:38:14.680 --> 00:38:16.680]   Just like it says in Philippians 2.
[00:38:16.680 --> 00:38:17.680]   Right?
[00:38:17.680 --> 00:38:18.680]   That because He humbled Himself became nothing.
[00:38:18.680 --> 00:38:20.680]   God exalted Him to the highest place.
[00:38:20.680 --> 00:38:24.680]   Every knee shall bow, every tongue confess that Jesus Christ is Lord.
[00:38:24.680 --> 00:38:26.680]   And so that's the scene that we see here.
[00:38:26.680 --> 00:38:27.680]   Right?
[00:38:27.680 --> 00:38:29.680]   Every tongue confess.
[00:38:29.680 --> 00:38:31.680]   Every knee bowed confessing He is Lord.
[00:38:31.680 --> 00:38:39.680]   And so He sees that when His full glory comes that all this vying to who's the superpower?
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:40.680]   Is it China?
[00:38:40.680 --> 00:38:41.680]   Is it America?
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:42.680]   Who's going to have the influence?
[00:38:42.680 --> 00:38:43.680]   Is it going to be Donald Trump?
[00:38:43.680 --> 00:38:44.680]   Is it Clinton?
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:48.680]   You know it's like all of that stuff is going to be wiped out because they're the moons.
[00:38:48.680 --> 00:38:50.680]   They're the sun.
[00:38:50.680 --> 00:38:51.680]   Right?
[00:38:51.680 --> 00:38:53.680]   In our generation they're the billionaires.
[00:38:53.680 --> 00:38:54.680]   They're the rich.
[00:38:54.680 --> 00:38:55.680]   They're the famous.
[00:38:55.680 --> 00:38:56.680]   They're the influential.
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:59.680]   But when God's glory comes all of them are going to be humbled.
[00:38:59.680 --> 00:39:02.680]   And in His presence nobody can boast.
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:03.680]   Right?
[00:39:03.680 --> 00:39:08.680]   And so Isaiah is seeing that and that's causing him to break out in praise.
[00:39:08.680 --> 00:39:09.680]   Right?
[00:39:09.680 --> 00:39:11.680]   The ruthless nations will fear Him.
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:13.680]   Right?
[00:39:13.680 --> 00:39:21.680]   That all this terrorism trying to bring fear upon the generation when His full glory comes
[00:39:21.680 --> 00:39:24.680]   the most ruthless people will end up fearing Him.
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:27.680]   Not them.
[00:39:27.680 --> 00:39:31.680]   But the flip side of that because of this judgment He says the protection for the poor
[00:39:31.680 --> 00:39:35.680]   and the stronghold to the needy and the distressed and shelter from the storm and the heat.
[00:39:35.680 --> 00:39:37.680]   So again you're going back and forth.
[00:39:37.680 --> 00:39:42.680]   You have terror to those who are in sin and oppressing but again He is a deliverer to
[00:39:42.680 --> 00:39:44.680]   those who are being oppressed.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:45.680]   Right?
[00:39:45.680 --> 00:39:50.680]   And that's what the glory of God does.
[00:39:50.680 --> 00:39:53.680]   So the final scene that we see in Isaiah 25.
[00:39:53.680 --> 00:39:54.680]   Okay?
[00:39:54.680 --> 00:40:00.680]   Not the final scene but at least in this section.
[00:40:00.680 --> 00:40:04.680]   Again just the verse I think captures that section well.
[00:40:04.680 --> 00:40:07.680]   "I will destroy the wisdom of the wise and the discernment of the discerning.
[00:40:07.680 --> 00:40:08.680]   I will thwart.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:09.680]   Where is the one who is wise?
[00:40:09.680 --> 00:40:10.680]   Where is the scribe?
[00:40:10.680 --> 00:40:11.680]   Where is the debaters of this age?
[00:40:11.680 --> 00:40:14.680]   Has not God made foolish the wisdom of the world?
[00:40:14.680 --> 00:40:17.680]   For since in the wisdom of God the world did not know God through wisdom.
[00:40:17.680 --> 00:40:21.680]   It pleased God through the folly of what we preach to save those who believe."
[00:40:21.680 --> 00:40:22.680]   Right?
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:27.680]   And again this is something that we need to be careful about because even in the pursuit
[00:40:27.680 --> 00:40:34.680]   of Christ sometimes we seek wisdom above brokenness before Christ.
[00:40:34.680 --> 00:40:35.680]   You know what I mean?
[00:40:35.680 --> 00:40:39.680]   We kind of measure someone's spirituality based upon how much they know, how much they
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:45.680]   can articulate and sometimes if we're not careful we're taking the competition and
[00:40:45.680 --> 00:40:51.680]   personal ambition of the world and you're just doing it in the church in the name of
[00:40:51.680 --> 00:40:53.680]   Christ with the Bible and theology.
[00:40:53.680 --> 00:40:54.680]   Right?
[00:40:54.680 --> 00:40:55.680]   Experience.
[00:40:55.680 --> 00:40:56.680]   Right?
[00:40:56.680 --> 00:41:01.680]   If you're influential and if you look at church history that's what ruined the church.
[00:41:01.680 --> 00:41:07.680]   You have men, in particular men, who have taken their worldly ambition and just applied
[00:41:07.680 --> 00:41:08.680]   it in the church.
[00:41:08.680 --> 00:41:09.680]   Right?
[00:41:09.680 --> 00:41:19.680]   And so again this is a constant reminder to us that the greatest spiritual maturity is
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:22.680]   not the one who's greatest in the eyes of man.
[00:41:22.680 --> 00:41:23.680]   Right?
[00:41:23.680 --> 00:41:27.680]   And I think, you know, I shared with some people, I think one thing that Harry shared
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:31.680]   coming back from India, you know, that was really encouraging to me where he, I think,
[00:41:31.680 --> 00:41:36.680]   I don't know the exact words but he basically said that, you know, he thought that the great
[00:41:36.680 --> 00:41:42.680]   men that he looked up to were all preachers and theologians who articulated and had influence
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:45.680]   and then going to India he's people who have nothing.
[00:41:45.680 --> 00:41:49.680]   If they die there's no celebration, nothing.
[00:41:49.680 --> 00:41:52.680]   And these are giants of faith that nobody knows about.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:53.680]   Right?
[00:41:53.680 --> 00:41:55.680]   Because, simply because they have genuine faith.
[00:41:55.680 --> 00:41:56.680]   Right?
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:00.680]   And so again all of this, even though it's talking about in times, it's a reminder to
[00:42:00.680 --> 00:42:08.680]   all of us that our greatest passion and pursuit is to become less and less, not more and more.
[00:42:08.680 --> 00:42:09.680]   Right?
[00:42:09.680 --> 00:42:10.680]   To become less and less.
[00:42:10.680 --> 00:42:15.680]   Less visible, less arrogant, less boasting and more Christ.
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:16.680]   Right?
[00:42:16.680 --> 00:42:23.680]   What will the Lord do and say in this mountain, and again this mountain is referring to the
[00:42:23.680 --> 00:42:26.680]   restoration of his kingdom, his second coming.
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:30.680]   You can call it heaven, you can call it new heaven, whatever it is.
[00:42:30.680 --> 00:42:35.680]   He said there's going to be plenty of food and wine.
[00:42:35.680 --> 00:42:38.680]   There will be no more death.
[00:42:38.680 --> 00:42:41.680]   Tears will be wiped away forever.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:44.680]   Approach of his people will be taken away.
[00:42:44.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   Right?
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:48.680]   And the savior will be their God.
[00:42:48.680 --> 00:42:54.680]   What does this sound like?
[00:42:54.680 --> 00:42:58.680]   Revelation, and I'm going to show you a verse in a minute.
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:02.680]   Chapter 24, remember the devastation that he talks about?
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:04.680]   The source of joy.
[00:43:04.680 --> 00:43:05.680]   Right?
[00:43:05.680 --> 00:43:08.680]   The joy itself, it's going to be utterly wiped away.
[00:43:08.680 --> 00:43:12.680]   So if you take what he says here, it's in contrast.
[00:43:12.680 --> 00:43:13.680]   Right?
[00:43:13.680 --> 00:43:18.680]   The devastation that's going to come because of sin is going to be wiped out, and then
[00:43:18.680 --> 00:43:22.680]   once the judgment is complete, then he's going to restore.
[00:43:22.680 --> 00:43:23.680]   Right?
[00:43:23.680 --> 00:43:27.680]   And he's not just restoring us back to where it was like in the Garden of Eden.
[00:43:27.680 --> 00:43:32.680]   This is a question that somebody asked years ago, and I thought it was a good question.
[00:43:32.680 --> 00:43:39.680]   If Adam and Eve fell at the Garden of Eden, what is the guarantee that we're not going
[00:43:39.680 --> 00:43:44.680]   to fall in Heaven?
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:45.680]   Just think about it for a minute.
[00:43:45.680 --> 00:43:46.680]   Don't say anything.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.680]   Okay?
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:53.680]   If Adam and Eve, when they were sinless in the Garden of Eden, fell because Satan came
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:44:00.680]   and tempted, what prevents us in our eternal state from falling again?
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:10.680]   Basically, are we starting over, and then are we…
[00:44:10.680 --> 00:44:12.680]   No one to tempt?
[00:44:12.680 --> 00:44:16.680]   But Satan fell.
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:17.680]   Okay.
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:21.680]   But could another tempter take his place?
[00:44:21.680 --> 00:44:25.680]   So there's a possibility.
[00:44:25.680 --> 00:44:48.680]   [inaudible]
[00:44:48.680 --> 00:44:50.680]   Was he not?
[00:44:50.680 --> 00:44:52.680]   [laughter]
[00:44:52.680 --> 00:44:54.680]   I don't know.
[00:44:54.680 --> 00:45:17.680]   [inaudible]
[00:45:17.680 --> 00:45:25.680]   All right.
[00:45:25.680 --> 00:45:28.680]   So let me just play the devil's advocate, okay?
[00:45:28.680 --> 00:45:35.680]   So does that mean then, because God didn't provide his full protection of his presence,
[00:45:35.680 --> 00:45:37.680]   that's why they fell?
[00:45:37.680 --> 00:45:43.680]   So in Heaven, because there's a fuller presence of his glory, which he didn't give at the
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:45.680]   Garden of Eden.
[00:45:45.680 --> 00:45:51.680]   So is that what's going to be the difference?
[00:45:51.680 --> 00:45:54.680]   But God withheld that at the Garden of Eden.
[00:45:54.680 --> 00:45:56.680]   All right.
[00:45:56.680 --> 00:45:58.680]   Okay.
[00:45:58.680 --> 00:46:22.680]   [inaudible]
[00:46:22.680 --> 00:46:24.680]   Okay.
[00:46:24.680 --> 00:46:32.680]   [inaudible]
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:34.680]   Okay.
[00:46:34.680 --> 00:47:00.680]   [inaudible]
[00:47:00.680 --> 00:47:02.680]   Okay.
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   [inaudible]
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:23.680]   Clearly it's different, right?
[00:47:23.680 --> 00:47:24.680]   Clearly it's different.
[00:47:24.680 --> 00:47:28.680]   Where in Adam and Eve, God warns, "If you do this, you're going to die."
[00:47:28.680 --> 00:47:31.680]   But in the eternal state, he says, "Death has no sting."
[00:47:31.680 --> 00:47:32.680]   Right?
[00:47:32.680 --> 00:47:34.680]   Death will be done away, it will be forever.
[00:47:34.680 --> 00:47:36.680]   Right?
[00:47:36.680 --> 00:47:38.680]   Somebody had a...
[00:47:38.680 --> 00:48:06.680]   [inaudible]
[00:48:06.680 --> 00:48:13.680]   [inaudible]
[00:48:13.680 --> 00:48:14.680]   Okay.
[00:48:14.680 --> 00:48:21.680]   So the second state that we'll be in, we would only fall if Christ can fall.
[00:48:21.680 --> 00:48:25.680]   Because we have the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:48:25.680 --> 00:48:29.680]   Where the new wine cannot be in old wine skin, so he made us new.
[00:48:29.680 --> 00:48:33.680]   And then the Holy Spirit came, we were baptized and covered by the blood of Christ.
[00:48:33.680 --> 00:48:35.680]   That's the state that's different.
[00:48:35.680 --> 00:48:37.680]   And we became like him in his resurrection.
[00:48:37.680 --> 00:48:38.680]   Right?
[00:48:38.680 --> 00:48:40.680]   So the second state, when he's talking about the eternal state,
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:44.680]   our eternal state is going to be beyond what it was at the Garden of Eden.
[00:48:44.680 --> 00:48:46.680]   At least that's the way it's described in the scripture.
[00:48:46.680 --> 00:48:51.680]   So when we talk about all of this, all of this is not temporary.
[00:48:51.680 --> 00:48:54.680]   And you better not screw up this time.
[00:48:54.680 --> 00:48:55.680]   Right?
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:56.680]   This is all permanent.
[00:48:56.680 --> 00:49:01.680]   It's at the end of his glory that this is the state that God's going to bring us in to eternity.
[00:49:01.680 --> 00:49:02.680]   Right?
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:05.680]   Again, that's why when we talk about his glory and we talk about the final state,
[00:49:05.680 --> 00:49:08.680]   that this is unlike the other things that he's been talking about.
[00:49:08.680 --> 00:49:12.680]   Where he says that judgment is coming, he restores them, but then they fall.
[00:49:12.680 --> 00:49:14.680]   He judges them, restores them, falls.
[00:49:14.680 --> 00:49:16.680]   He's talking about the end.
[00:49:16.680 --> 00:49:17.680]   Right?
[00:49:17.680 --> 00:49:19.680]   So there's this mixture.
[00:49:19.680 --> 00:49:22.680]   So if you're looking at that, if you're Isaiah and the prophet's looking at this,
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:26.680]   you see that the final state coming.
[00:49:26.680 --> 00:49:29.680]   You can't fully make it out.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.680]   But you see what's coming.
[00:49:31.680 --> 00:49:34.680]   But you see all the devastation in between that's going to get us there.
[00:49:34.680 --> 00:49:35.680]   Right?
[00:49:35.680 --> 00:49:40.680]   And so that's kind of like the mixture of emotion you see in chapter 24 and 25.
[00:49:40.680 --> 00:49:43.680]   And I think that's the state even for Christians.
[00:49:43.680 --> 00:49:44.680]   Right?
[00:49:44.680 --> 00:49:47.680]   There's a part of us that rejoices over our salvation.
[00:49:47.680 --> 00:49:50.680]   There's a part of us that eagerly waits for a second coming.
[00:49:50.680 --> 00:49:54.680]   But there's also a part of us mourning because we know what that means.
[00:49:54.680 --> 00:49:55.680]   Right?
[00:49:55.680 --> 00:49:57.680]   You say, "Why isn't he coming?"
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:01.680]   Because God is gracious and he's giving plenty of time for people to come to Christ.
[00:50:01.680 --> 00:50:05.680]   And that's why he says, "Until he comes, what are we to do?"
[00:50:05.680 --> 00:50:09.680]   Until he comes, take the gospel to the remotest part of the world.
[00:50:09.680 --> 00:50:10.680]   Right?
[00:50:10.680 --> 00:50:14.680]   Because along with this joy, there's devastation coming all at once.
[00:50:14.680 --> 00:50:15.680]   Right?
[00:50:15.680 --> 00:50:16.680]   So, again, that's a state.
[00:50:16.680 --> 00:50:22.680]   What Isaiah is feeling is what every Christian ought to be wrestling with on a daily basis
[00:50:22.680 --> 00:50:25.680]   where there's rejoicing and mourning at the same time.
[00:50:25.680 --> 00:50:26.680]   Right?
[00:50:26.680 --> 00:50:27.680]   Okay.
[00:50:27.680 --> 00:50:34.680]   Again, the last part of it is going to take us back to the Moabites.
[00:50:34.680 --> 00:50:35.680]   Okay?
[00:50:35.680 --> 00:50:37.680]   They always judge because of their pompous pride.
[00:50:37.680 --> 00:50:39.680]   And again, Moab is just one example.
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:41.680]   Again, it's not just Moab.
[00:50:41.680 --> 00:50:43.680]   Remember that why is he judging?
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:45.680]   It's over and over and over and over again.
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:46.680]   It's the same thing.
[00:50:46.680 --> 00:50:47.680]   It's their pride.
[00:50:47.680 --> 00:50:48.680]   It's their pride.
[00:50:48.680 --> 00:50:49.680]   It's their pride.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:50.680]   Right?
[00:50:50.680 --> 00:50:51.680]   It's your desire to elevate yourself.
[00:50:51.680 --> 00:50:52.680]   It's your desire to be like God.
[00:50:52.680 --> 00:50:54.680]   It's your desire to be better than others.
[00:50:54.680 --> 00:50:57.680]   He said that God is going to humble.
[00:50:57.680 --> 00:51:02.680]   So when the scripture says God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble, applies
[00:51:02.680 --> 00:51:06.680]   to every generation, every man, at all times.
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:12.680]   Because the underlying sin that causes all this stuff, division in the church, you know,
[00:51:12.680 --> 00:51:17.680]   marriage issues, everything that we know, the underlying problem is pride.
[00:51:17.680 --> 00:51:18.680]   Right?
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:24.680]   So if you think about it, like why did Jesus, why was he so harsh with the Pharisees?
[00:51:24.680 --> 00:51:27.680]   On the surface, they are the ones reading the Bible.
[00:51:27.680 --> 00:51:28.680]   They're the ones going out witnessing.
[00:51:28.680 --> 00:51:30.680]   They're the ones memorizing scripture.
[00:51:30.680 --> 00:51:31.680]   They're the ones fasting.
[00:51:31.680 --> 00:51:32.680]   They're the ones giving.
[00:51:32.680 --> 00:51:34.680]   These tax collectors did nothing.
[00:51:34.680 --> 00:51:37.680]   They betrayed their nation.
[00:51:37.680 --> 00:51:40.680]   But he was most angry with the Pharisees.
[00:51:40.680 --> 00:51:41.680]   Right?
[00:51:41.680 --> 00:51:43.680]   He said, "Oh, maybe because they were leaders."
[00:51:43.680 --> 00:51:44.680]   True.
[00:51:44.680 --> 00:51:45.680]   I mean, that's part of it.
[00:51:45.680 --> 00:51:46.680]   There's stricter judgment.
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.680]   But his anger toward them was beyond that.
[00:51:48.680 --> 00:51:49.680]   Right?
[00:51:49.680 --> 00:51:53.680]   It wasn't just because, "Hey, you leaders, you guys should have set a better example."
[00:51:53.680 --> 00:51:57.680]   Then I would think that he would come and say, "Okay, you guys have some things you need
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:51:58.680]   to work on."
[00:51:58.680 --> 00:51:59.680]   Right?
[00:51:59.680 --> 00:52:00.680]   "You need to set a better example."
[00:52:00.680 --> 00:52:04.680]   In fact, he just said, "This is all completely rotten."
[00:52:04.680 --> 00:52:05.680]   Right?
[00:52:05.680 --> 00:52:11.680]   And you see the encounter with Nicodemus in chapter 3 of John, and you see the encounter
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:13.680]   with the Samaritan woman.
[00:52:13.680 --> 00:52:16.680]   He's kind of like coaxing and bringing her along.
[00:52:16.680 --> 00:52:22.680]   And then with Nicodemus, he says, "You have to be born again.
[00:52:22.680 --> 00:52:24.680]   What you're thinking is completely wrong.
[00:52:24.680 --> 00:52:26.680]   Your way is completely wrong."
[00:52:26.680 --> 00:52:27.680]   Right?
[00:52:27.680 --> 00:52:32.680]   Because underlying the greatest sin that keeps us from God is our own pride.
[00:52:32.680 --> 00:52:33.680]   Right?
[00:52:33.680 --> 00:52:38.680]   So even in the context of reading the Bible, and doing religious things, and serving the
[00:52:38.680 --> 00:52:44.680]   church, and even evangelizing and doing all this stuff, if it is filled with pride, if
[00:52:44.680 --> 00:52:50.680]   this is what's ruined mankind, if there's any sin that God is more sensitive to than
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:53.680]   anything else, I would think it would be this.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.680]   Because he keeps mentioning this over and over and over.
[00:52:56.680 --> 00:52:58.680]   Every nation, every person, right?
[00:52:58.680 --> 00:53:01.680]   Every church is this.
[00:53:01.680 --> 00:53:02.680]   Right?
[00:53:02.680 --> 00:53:07.680]   So I don't think it was by accident that Jesus came as a servant.
[00:53:07.680 --> 00:53:10.680]   Because you guys are all trying to be somebody.
[00:53:10.680 --> 00:53:13.680]   Now he's going to become nothing.
[00:53:13.680 --> 00:53:16.680]   Even to the very end, the disciples are like, "Oh, who's going to sit on the left or the
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:17.680]   right?"
[00:53:17.680 --> 00:53:20.680]   The very last thing he does is he washes their feet.
[00:53:20.680 --> 00:53:21.680]   Right?
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.680]   So he's doing exactly, because he knows what's in their heart.
[00:53:24.680 --> 00:53:30.680]   He knows that even in the context of following Jesus, like they're competing with one another.
[00:53:30.680 --> 00:53:34.680]   And Jesus is going exactly the opposite direction.
[00:53:34.680 --> 00:53:35.680]   Right?
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:40.680]   So if there's any sin that God is more sensitive to, it's this.
[00:53:40.680 --> 00:53:41.680]   It's our pride.
[00:53:41.680 --> 00:53:43.680]   Because that's where all this stuff stems from.
[00:53:43.680 --> 00:53:48.680]   Right?
[00:53:48.680 --> 00:53:51.680]   Alright.
[00:53:51.680 --> 00:53:52.680]   Alright, the end.
[00:53:52.680 --> 00:53:57.680]   Alright, if you guys can take some time to pray and to, again, discuss with your group.
[00:53:57.680 --> 00:54:01.680]   If you have any questions about your small group or maybe I put you in the wrong place,
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:02.680]   just let me know.
[00:54:02.680 --> 00:54:09.680]   Alright, bye now.
[00:54:10.680 --> 00:54:13.680]   [End of Audio]
[00:54:13.680 --> 00:54:18.680]   Thank you.
