[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   And I mean it's crazy to think that the 2014 year is about to end and we're about to start 2015.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:14.000]   And you know, just kind of reflecting upon what's going on in my family's life,
[00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   most of you guys already know that in about a little bit over 100 days or so,
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   our family will be moving out to East Asia to permanently do ministry out there.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   And so with this kind of move, again, I had never moved to a different country before,
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   and so I'm being exposed to a lot more different kinds of factors and burdens and stresses.
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   And it's pretty interesting.
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   And you have to think about, okay, who's going to take the cars?
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   Who's going to take the furniture?
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   What are we going to do about all of our clothes and books?
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   And I know some of you guys have asked me about my books.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   Yes, I might be giving them away for free.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Just give you guys a heads up for that.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   And so there's a lot of adjustments that we have to make.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:08.000]   And on top of that, when we actually get there, there's a lot more adjustments, you know,
[00:01:08.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   the language, the culture, the smells, the weather, the pollution.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   I know, I've heard it all, heard it all, been through it all.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   And I have to confess that when I take all of those factors all at once, it becomes really overwhelming.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   There's days where I wish 2015 would not come, you know,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   as if I had some sort of cosmic power to prevent time from going forward or whatnot.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   And so obviously I know that's not the right attitude.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I know that's not the right perspective.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   And so a lot of times it just comes down to two factors.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   You know, I need strength and I need courage.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And that's why Joshua 1, 1 through 9 stands out to me,
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   because this is a passage that if you want strength and you want courage,
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   if you want conviction for those two things, this is the passage that you need to go to,
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   to study from and to really have that marinate in your heart.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   And so what we're going to do is we're going to look at Joshua 1, 1 through 9 this morning.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   And I just want to emphasize three aspects of what strength and courage truly is.
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   Okay. Three aspects. And so we'll read the text and then and then we'll begin our study.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Starting from Joshua chapter 1, verse 1.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord, the Lord said to Joshua, the son of Nun, Moses' assistant,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   Moses, my servant, is dead.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   Now, therefore, arise, go over this Jordan, you and all this people into the land that I am giving to them, to the people of Israel.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   Every place that the sole of your foot will tread upon, I have given to you, just as I promised to Moses.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   From the wilderness and this Lebanon, as far as the great river, the river Euphrates,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   all the land of the Hittites to the great sea toward the going down of the sun shall be your territory.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I will not leave you or forsake you.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Be strong and courageous for you shall cause this people to inherit the lamb that I swore to their fathers to give them.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law that Moses, my servant, commanded you.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left, that you may have good success wherever you go.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:47.000]   so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[00:03:47.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   For then you will make your way prosperous and then you will have good success.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.000]   Have I not commanded you? Be strong and courageous.
[00:03:55.000 --> 00:03:58.000]   Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   For the Lord your God is with you wherever you go. Let's pray.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   Heavenly Father, we want to come to your word in a full submission,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   desiring, Lord God, as you have commanded Joshua, to meditate upon your word.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   And as we cover this topic of what true strength and courage is,
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   help us, Lord God, to have an open mind and open hearts to hear.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   Help us, Lord God, that if perhaps we're going through transitions in our lives,
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   especially with the new year coming, to really take hold of what you have commanded your people to,
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   what you have commanded your people to respond to when there are new transitions,
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   to be strong and to be courageous.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   And so, God, we ask for your blessing upon this time.
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:55.000]   In your name we pray. Amen.
[00:04:55.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   Alright, so again, we want to emphasize three aspects of strength and courage,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:02.000]   at least according to the Bible.
[00:05:02.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   And so the first aspect that I want us to look at is strength and courage.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   True strength and courage highlights humility.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:12.000]   True strength and courage highlights humility.
[00:05:12.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   And we find that in the first five verses in Joshua chapter 1.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   Now, you have to know, you kind of have to take a step back and look at Israel's history at this point.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   Israel is in the midst of great transitions.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   The people themselves are in the midst of transitions, right?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   If you guys remember that the people that comprised of the nation of Israel in the time of Joshua
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   are not the same people that left Egypt so many years back.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   There was a shift in Numbers 14 where the first generation of Israelites,
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   they were about to go into the promised land.
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   They sent in the 12 spies.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   The 12 spies came back and they gave like this really negative report like,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   "The land is good. The fruit is good.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   But the people that are living in this land are really strong and we're going to get destroyed by them."
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   And because of their unbelief and because of their unwillingness to go forward
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   in spite of God's promises to them, God says,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   "This generation of Israelites will never enter the promised land."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And so that led into the 40 years of wandering in the wilderness
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   where within those 40 years, the first generation of Israelites had to pass away.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   And so here we have in Joshua, this new generation of Israelites
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   who have experienced what they've seen in the 40 years of wilderness, wandering there.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   And they're about to enter into this promised land.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   It's not like these Israelites had training to fight battles or, you know,
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   if they had any kind of military acumen.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   But yet they're still commanded to go.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:02.000]   But more importantly, I think the greater transition that's taking place here is the leadership.
[00:07:02.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   If you guys go back to Deuteronomy chapter 34, I mean, it details Moses' death.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:12.000]   And we all know Moses is a central figure in the Old Testament,
[00:07:12.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   especially from Exodus to Deuteronomy.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   He's the one that led Israel, a young nation, out of the nation of Egypt
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   into Mount Sinai to receive the Ten Commandments.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   It is Moses that led them from Mount Sinai to get to the promised land in Numbers chapter 13.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:36.000]   And it's Moses that had to lead the nation of Israel into the wilderness to wander for 40 years.
[00:07:36.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   And so Israel's attachment to Moses was pretty strong.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   He was the only leader that they've ever known or ever talked to.
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   And yet Moses is dead.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And Joshua is the one that's left to take the reins.
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   And so if you look at it from a human perspective,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   oh yeah, there's a lot of reasons for the nation of Israel and for Joshua to feel very unsettled,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   uncertain.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   These changes, these transitions seem to be coming so quick.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   And if you look at everything all together,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   yeah, you might think that Joshua and the nation of Israel are feeling very overwhelmed at this point.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   And so what is the response?
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.000]   What is the heart motive that Joshua and the nation of Israel is supposed to have
[00:08:27.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   during this great transition in their history?
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:34.000]   It's humility.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   And the reason why I say that is because look at Moses in verse 1.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   "After the death of Moses, the servant of the Lord."
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   Verse 2, "Moses, my servant, is dead."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   God's description of Moses is the key to unlock,
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   unlocking the motivation that Joshua is supposed to have as the new leader of Israel.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   Again, while we may get caught up in looking at Moses and thinking that he is this great leader
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:10.000]   that led thousands of people out of one nation and was their spiritual leader and whatnot,
[00:09:10.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   the higher identity or the more prominent identity that we need to ascribe to Moses
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   is that he is the servant of the Lord.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   That he is the servant of the Lord.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Again, it's emphasized again in verses 13 and 15 of Joshua chapter 1.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   And again, the image of a servant isn't really positive.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   You know, a lot of times when you think of a servant, you think of someone who is weak or lacks power and control.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   But if you've read your Bible and if you're aware of the scriptures,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:47.000]   you know that the image of a servant, especially when it's connected to God,
[00:09:47.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   is something that contains a lot of strength and a lot of courage.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:54.000]   Right?
[00:09:54.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   If you just look at the introduction of every New Testament epistle, right,
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   whether written by Paul or Peter or John,
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   you'll notice that they always introduce themselves as a servant of Christ or the servant of God.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   Now, if you take the negative connotation of the word servant and apply it to them,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   you wouldn't think of Paul, Peter, and John or any other writer of, or any other author of scripture
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   as being weak or lacking a power or control. Right?
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   I mean, Paul himself is someone who is convicted,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   someone who exudes strength and courage even in the midst of persecution.
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   And so being a servant is not a bad thing.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And I know there's a lot of characteristics that comes with describing who, like what is a servant.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   But the one characteristic I want us to highlight this morning is the servant's humility.
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   Someone who desires to be humble before their master.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   A summarized phrase for humility could go something like this,
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:06.000]   "Less of me, more of Christ."
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Yeah, I know. I took that from John the Baptist.
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:11.000]   You could do that in scripture, you know.
[00:11:11.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   "But less of me, more of Christ."
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   A servant of the Lord will exhibit this type of humility,
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   wanting their whole life not to be about themselves,
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   but to make more of their master, to make more of their Lord and Savior.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Again, using Moses as an example here, his whole life was marked by leading.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   And yet, in Numbers chapter 12 verse 3,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   it describes Moses being humble, as being very meek out of all the people in the land.
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:54.000]   A better example would be the better Moses in Jesus.
[00:11:54.000 --> 00:11:58.000]   Even Christ himself, he's described as a servant, right?
[00:11:58.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   In the book of Isaiah, there are four servant songs,
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   and all those servant songs describe who Jesus is.
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   Mark chapter 10 verse 45,
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:11.000]   "For even the Son of Man came not to be served,
[00:12:11.000 --> 00:12:15.000]   but to serve and to give his life as a ransom for many."
[00:12:15.000 --> 00:12:18.000]   Servant, being a servant is not a bad thing.
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   Being humble before the Lord is not a bad thing.
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:24.000]   Philippians 2, right?
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   Christ had to humble himself by putting on human flesh in order to redeem mankind.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   We need to understand that humility plays a role
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   in exhibiting true strength and true courage in the Christian faith.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   Everything that this world tries to inform us of what is strong and what is courageous
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   is always tainted with a sense of pride and entitlement.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:51.000]   There's always a sense of pride and entitlement
[00:12:51.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   whenever this depiction that the world gives of strength and courage comes up.
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   But when we consider the scripture,
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:04.000]   true strength and courage stems from a heart that desires to be humble,
[00:13:04.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   that desires to be weak before the Lord.
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   It's a heart that acknowledges a need for God in your darkest period of life.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   It is a heart that cries out to God for assistance in time of need.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   It begins with a heart of prayer that seeks God
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   and understands that every bit of action in your life needs His grace and mercy.
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   Psalm chapter 69, if you guys would turn there with me.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   And if you're to ask me like out on the side,
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   like what are you going through your devos through?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   I've been going through the Psalms and it's been a really good study
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   and just understanding about, you know, these poems and these Psalms
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   that's praising God.
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   And Psalm 69 sticks out to me for various reasons.
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   And Psalm 69 is a Psalm written by David.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   And obviously if you just take a quick glance at the Psalm,
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   David's going through a lot of stuff.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Just read the first three verses.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   He says, "Save me, O God, for the waters have come up to my neck.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   I sink in deep mire where there is no foothold.
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   I have come into deep waters and the flood sweeps over me.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:22.000]   I am weary with my crying out. My throat is parched.
[00:14:22.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   My eyes grow dim with waiting for my God."
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:28.000]   Just reading the first three verses alone kind of informs us that David
[00:14:28.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   is going through something really desperate.
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   He's going through some hard times here.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:35.000]   I don't know if you guys ever drowned.
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   I drowned once and it wasn't pleasant.
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   There's no foothold for you to kind of push off, you know,
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:43.000]   to try to get back to the air.
[00:14:43.000 --> 00:14:46.000]   You're just kind of suspended in the water and you just don't know
[00:14:46.000 --> 00:14:50.000]   where your help is going to come from.
[00:14:50.000 --> 00:14:58.000]   And so clearly David is going through some intense stress and intense burdens.
[00:14:58.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   And you would think that his response to the Lord would be, "Hurry up, God.
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Can you hurry up and answer my prayer because right now I am desperate for you."
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   But look at verse 13.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   David writes, "But as for me, my prayer is to you, O Lord.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:23.000]   At an acceptable time, O God, in the abundance of your steadfast love,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   answer me in your saving faithfulness."
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   David's response in verse 13 exudes true strength and courage
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   because he humbles himself before God.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   He understands that the situation he's in is troublesome.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   He understands that his prayers are being heard by God.
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   But only God will answer his prayers in accordance to God's time,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   according to, as David says, his acceptable time.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:16:02.000]   Instead of trying to pump himself up to overcome his situations,
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:08.000]   David chooses to humble himself and to yield to the sovereignty of God.
[00:16:08.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   That is true strength and courage in the midst of trying times.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   And I'm sure as we as individuals continue to grow and experience more in this life,
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   we're going to find that the solutions to our problems and sometimes the obstacles that come
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   are not going to be our willpower or it's not going to be our problem-solving abilities.
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Rather, the answer is going to come through humbling ourselves before the Lord,
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   seeking Him out in prayer continually.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   I remember when I was going to seminary that seminary is tough.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:57.000]   There's a lot of studying to do. A lot of the drive itself was killer.
[00:16:57.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   When Pastor Peter talks about me, he always says that I'm a workhorse.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I just get stuff done. I take pride in that.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:11.000]   Because that's kind of how God designed me.
[00:17:11.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   But when I was in seminary, I really felt that that gift that God has given me,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   this ability to try to get stuff done, this willpower,
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   was not being used in a manner that would glorify God the most.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   I remember hitting a wall my fourth year in seminary,
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   where I was just utterly, utterly slammed with work.
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   I just felt like I couldn't stay up as late as I could have.
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   I couldn't put forth the effort that I used to put when I was younger.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   So I remember I had to confess before God.
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   God, I'm kind of in a funk right now.
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   I think part of the reason why I'm in this funk is because I've grown proud
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:59.000]   in this gift that you have given to me.
[00:17:59.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   I remember confessing that before God and seeking His forgiveness.
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   I remember ever since that fourth year, I decided to say,
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   "Whatever someone asks me for prayer requests,"
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   because we pray for each other at seminary. I think that's a good thing.
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:19.000]   One of my prayer requests that I would say to them is,
[00:18:19.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   "Pray that everything that I do in seminary is an act of worship to God,
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:26.000]   that it's not just simply about getting stuff done,
[00:18:26.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   but to really have that humble perspective that everything matters before Him."
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   That changed everything in seminary. It really did.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Even when Haddon was born and I had to juggle all those things,
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:44.000]   the last year and a half that I was in seminary was such a testament
[00:18:44.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   to His grace and to His mercy in my life.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:51.000]   I can't imagine getting through that without relying upon Him,
[00:18:51.000 --> 00:18:56.000]   to having that strength draw from God.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   We need to understand that true strength and courage is going to come
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   by humbling ourselves before the Lord.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   The second aspect of true strength and courage is this.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   True strength and courage derives from believing His promises and His Word.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   We find that in verses 6 through 8.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   "Be strong and courageous, for you shall cause these people to inherit the land
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   that I swore to their fathers to give them.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Only be strong and very courageous, being careful to do according to all the law
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   that Moses my servant commanded you.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   Do not turn from it to the right hand or to the left,
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   that you may have good success wherever you go.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth,
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   but you shall meditate on it day and night,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   For then you will make your way prosperous,
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   and then you will have good success."
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   So after God commands Joshua to take Israel into the promised land,
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   God uses this phrase to be strong and courageous twice in verses 6 through 8.
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   The repetition of this phrase implies importance to what God is saying.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   And in the Hebrew, this phrase is actually an imperative.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   So it's a command.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   There is no other option for Joshua at this point.
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   He has to be strong and courageous.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   There is no room for cowardness or fear as he leads Israel into conquest.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And thank God that he didn't just simply tell Joshua to be strong and courageous,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   and then he just leaves Joshua.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:42.000]   And he gives him two sources to draw from in order to be strong and courageous.
[00:20:42.000 --> 00:20:50.000]   And the first source that he lists off for Joshua is God's promises.
[00:20:50.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   We find that in verse 6.
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   Joshua is to be strong and courageous because God's told him,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:20:59.000]   "Through you, Israel is going to inherit the land."
[00:20:59.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Again, if you've been at Berean for a period of time,
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   you know that the land is pretty significant in Israel's history.
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   This is, in one sense, already promised to them ever since Abraham in Genesis 12.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:21.000]   And so this nation of Israel has been waiting for several centuries,
[00:21:21.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   waiting to attain this land once and for all.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   And in the midst of waiting, they've endured slavery.
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   They've endured wandering in the wilderness.
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   In the midst of waiting, they were able to experience God's grace and mercy in their lives as they traveled.
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And so when there's a promise made by God, and he's making that pretty clear in verse 6,
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   God is going to keep that promise.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   And if you go through Scripture, you know that God has an excellent track record of keeping his promises,
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   especially when they're listed out in Scripture.
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   Just think about Jesus' birth.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We just celebrated Christmas a few days ago, right?
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   And I know we're celebrating that it's the birth of Christ,
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   and it's the beginning of God's redemption plan for the lost.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:18.000]   But at the basis of his birth is a promise.
[00:22:18.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   God promised that Jesus would come in Genesis chapter 3.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   God promised that Jesus was going to come in Isaiah chapter 9.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   And so while we're celebrating his birth, we're also celebrating that, man, God keeps his promises.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   What he says, it will come.
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:42.000]   And think about all the promises that hasn't been fulfilled yet, that we look forward to, right?
[00:22:42.000 --> 00:22:45.000]   Think about the promise of the resurrected body, right?
[00:22:45.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   I mean, one of these days, you know, we're all going to pass away.
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   And if we're believers in Christ, and we believe that we will be resurrected with new bodies,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   bodies that won't be tainted by sin, bodies that will last for eternity.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   That's a promise to look forward to.
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:07.000]   I mean, I'm looking forward to looking like, what am I going to look like in my new heavenly body?
[00:23:07.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Am I still going to have this scar on my forehead?
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:11.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:23:11.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   I'm not worried about it, but I ponder that.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   What about the promise of salvation being complete, right?
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:26.000]   If you're a believer in this room right now, you know that you're in the process of sanctification, right?
[00:23:26.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   Meaning, you're in the process of being made more like Christ.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   God reveals sin in your life, and you confess it, and you're repentant over that.
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   Well, what is it?
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   I mean, he promises us that one day, my salvation will be complete.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   You will no longer have this sin nature in you.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   You will no longer have to wrestle with sin.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   Which leads me to a third promise, no more sin and no more death.
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   I mean, that's the promise for me that I'm looking forward to seeing, right?
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   No more sin, no more death.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   No more cancer, no more pain and suffering.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:11.000]   No more tears, no more disappointments.
[00:24:11.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   That is a promise that God hasn't fulfilled yet, but he will keep that promise in the very end.
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   And when you consider all these promises, and what I presented to you is not the full load.
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.000]   It's only a scratch.
[00:24:25.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   But when you consider these promises, it gives us strength and courage to persevere in our present life.
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:35.000]   To live out our faith.
[00:24:35.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   The second source that God gives Joshua to draw from, to draw true strength and courage from, is his word.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   And we find that in verses 7 and 8.
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   And what makes God stand out from all the other false gods in this world is his clarity.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   He clearly communicates what his desire is and what his will is for his people.
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:07.000]   Again, in my experience, when I'm given clear instructions in what to do, I can perform that task with much more confidence, right?
[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I think about this time where Jen was at work, I was at home with Hadden, and I opened the refrigerator for lunch, right?
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   Like lunch for Hadden, not for me.
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And so I noticed that there was nothing in the fridge for Hadden.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:23.000]   And so I'm kind of wondering, hmm, like what's going to happen, you know?
[00:25:23.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   He doesn't like the baby food, so I'm like, I don't want to give him that.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   So I'm like wondering, what am I supposed to feed him?
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   And so I remember texting Jen, and I say, Jen, there's nothing in the fridge for Hadden.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I don't cook?
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   So what are we supposed to do?
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   And so Jen very graciously gave me instructions.
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   She gave me instructions on how to make this rice porridge that Hadden likes.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   And now, again, like I have a big fear of the kitchen and cooking in any sense, shape and form.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   In China, I think I almost burned down our apartment because I mixed some water and grease and fire, and it was not pretty.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   So I was kind of afraid, but Jen gave me very detailed instructions on how to make this porridge.
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   And so I followed that instruction to the T.
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   I was just like, okay, get one scoop of rice, put it in the bowl, put it in the pot, let it boil with water for a few minutes,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   and then pour a little soy sauce and put a little this and that, and just stir it for five or ten minutes.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:35.000]   Wait for it to cool down and then insert a spoon into the porridge and put it into Hadden's mouth.
[00:26:35.000 --> 00:26:37.000]   Okay?
[00:26:37.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   I followed it to the T, and he ate it all.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   So I count that as a success.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   But I use that illustration to tell us, like, when we are given instructions from God, it is clear what we're supposed to do.
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   And we can perform that with confidence because this is exactly what he wants.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   Because Joshua had the word of God, he has tremendous confidence in leading Israel into the promised land.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Right?
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   If you go a little bit further into Joshua, in Joshua chapter 6 and 7, Joshua is hit with crossroads immediately that tests whether or not Joshua will obey God's commands completely.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:21.000]   In Joshua chapter 6, it's the battle of Jericho, right?
[00:27:21.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   And we know this story from Sunday school.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:32.000]   The battle of Jericho is where God instructs Israel to walk around the walls of Jericho once every day for six days,
[00:27:32.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   and on the seventh day to walk around the walls of Jericho seven times, right?
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   And at the seventh time, blow their horns, and then the walls are supposed to fall down.
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:46.000]   If you were a skeptic back then, you probably think, "Is that really going to work?"
[00:27:46.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   Well, Joshua had the opportunity to either obey or disobey, and he chose to obey.
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:54.000]   And look what happened, right?
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   In Joshua chapter 6, the walls of Jericho falls down and they're able to conquer the city.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   As it says in chapter 6 verse 27, "So the Lord was with Joshua, and his fame was in all the land."
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   Joshua chapter 7 is another time where he had to face whether to obey or disobey God's law.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   In Joshua chapter 7, I titled it "The Sin of Achan."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   See, after they defeated Jericho, they went to another city called Ai,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   and it's a lot smaller than Jericho, and yet Israel actually lost that battle.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   And the reason why they lost that battle was because of sin.
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:34.000]   Someone sinned.
[00:28:34.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   And so there was this elaborate way of trying to draw out the sinner,
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   and finally Achan, this one man, confessed that, "Yeah, I sinned. I took some gold.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   I tried to hide it from myself."
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   So Joshua is at a crossroads.
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   Does he show grace?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   Does he show like, "It's okay. Just don't do it again, Achan."
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   Or do I just carry this, or do I have to follow God's law, which is to execute his family?
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   And you see in Joshua chapter 7 that no matter how hard the situation is,
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   Joshua obeyed the law.
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   And so we need to understand that God's promises and his word are a tremendous source
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   for strength and courage in the Christian life.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   Now, if I could say something, we need to remember that God's promises and his word are inseparable.
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   You can't have one without the other.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   And I know we're at a Bible-teaching church, and when you talk about Berean outside of Berean,
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   they always say, "Oh, that's a Bible-teaching church," right?
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:51.000]   But the danger that we have here is that we may assume that we know the Bible.
[00:29:51.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   We may assume that we know the Bible, and so we're satisfied with that assumption.
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:01.000]   Assuming to know the word and not taking time to dive into it,
[00:30:01.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   like what God commanded Joshua to do, to meditate upon it day and night,
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   will cause us to be separated from the promises of God.
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   And I don't mean that separation to be based upon knowledge.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   I think we know the promises of God.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:20.000]   I think some of us know the word of God.
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   But the separation that I'm talking about is your personal faith in his promises,
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   your personal faith and trust in his word.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:38.000]   I mean, the question that you could just phrase this is, "Do you believe in his promises?" Right?
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:45.000]   You know there's a difference between knowing and believing something, right?
[00:30:45.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   I'll use a polarizing figure. I'll use Jeremy Lin as an example, right?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:58.000]   Some may know and might think that Jeremy Lin is the best point guard in the world, right?
[00:30:58.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   But they don't really act it out.
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   They're just kind of on the sidelines, just kind of like, "Yeah, I think that."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   But if you actually believe that Jeremy Lin is the greatest point guard in the world,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   then you'll be the staunchest Jeremy Lin advocate wherever you go, right?
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   So knowing and believing is two separate things.
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:22.000]   And that's the danger that we live in, especially in our church.
[00:31:22.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   We cannot separate God's promises from his word.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   2 Peter 1, if you guys could turn there really quick.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   2 Peter 1, towards the end of the Bible.
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   2 Peter 1, verses 5 through 8, kind of gives us a list of--
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:54.000]   Peter is writing to his audience and he's saying, "For this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith."
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   And he gives a list, right?
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   "Your faith with virtue, with knowledge, with self-control, with steadfastness, with godliness, with breadthly affection, and with love."
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   And then if you go down to the next paragraph in verses 9 through 15, Peter writes,
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   "Therefore, I intend always to remind you of these qualities, though you know them and are established in the truth that you have.
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   I think it right as long as I am in this body to stir you up by way of reminder,
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   since I know that the putting off my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   And I will make every effort so that after my departure, you may be able at any time to recall these things."
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   Peter is acknowledging to his audience, "You already know this.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   You already know that your faith needs to be supplemented by these lists of things.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:52.000]   But I'm going to remind you one more time."
[00:32:52.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And as Christians living in this day and age,
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:02.000]   the source of our reminders of any of God's promises and any of His commands is going to be from His Word.
[00:33:02.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   So we cannot separate God's promises from His Word.
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   We need to be in it day and night, meditating upon it.
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   The moment we stop reading His Word is the moment that the separation from God's promises begin.
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   And when that separation occurs, we will lose strength and courage over a period of time.
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   Hebrews 2, 1 says that.
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   "Therefore, we must pay closer attention to what we have heard, or in our situation, what we have read, lest we drift away from it."
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   And so, we cover two aspects of it, of what true strength and true courage is.
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   True strength and courage exhibits humility.
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   True strength and courage derives from believing in His promises and His Word.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   The last aspect that I want to highlight this morning is this.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.000]   True strength and courage comes from being in God's presence.
[00:34:06.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   And we find that in verse 9.
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   "Have I not commanded you, 'Be strong and courageous.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed, for the Lord your God is with you wherever you go.'"
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   He commands him one more time, "Be strong and courageous, Joshua."
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   And he affirms this command by using the negative phrase, "Do not be frightened and do not be dismayed."
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And this is the second time that the Lord assures Joshua that He is going to be with him.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   His presence is going to be with him, right?
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:45.000]   In verse 5, it says, "No man shall be able to stand before you all the days of your life.
[00:34:45.000 --> 00:34:49.000]   Just as I was with Moses, so I will be with you.
[00:34:49.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   I will not leave you or forsake you."
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Joshua is one of two Israelites from the first generation that's able to enter into the Promised Land.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:04.000]   And so, in Joshua's eyes, he saw the presence of God.
[00:35:04.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   He saw the presence of God when he took Israel out of Egypt.
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   He saw the presence of God at Mount Sinai when Moses went up to receive the Ten Commandments.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:21.000]   Joshua saw the presence of God when he provided the manna and the quail for the Israelites as they wandered through the wilderness.
[00:35:21.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   He saw the presence of God when Moses struck the rock and water came down.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   And so, Joshua, if there's anyone who understands the weightiness of having God's presence in the mist,
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   it's Joshua.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   He understands the implications that are involved when God is with him.
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:49.000]   And so, what does God's presence entail?
[00:35:49.000 --> 00:35:59.000]   I think there's a lot of components to it, but the one component that I want us to really focus on is this, relationship.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   The presence of God entails relationship.
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   When you look at the life of Moses and Joshua, and two men who really are marked by the presence of God,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   they had an intimate and deep relationship with the Lord.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:24.000]   In Joshua, the phrase, "The Lord said to Joshua," appears 17 times in this entire book.
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   This implies the closeness of their relationship.
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:29.000]   God doesn't just speak to anyone.
[00:36:29.000 --> 00:36:32.000]   He speaks to those that he has a relationship with.
[00:36:32.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   Moses, in Deuteronomy 34, verse 10, he's described as someone whom the Lord knew face to face.
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   Again, the implication from that phrase, "face to face," implies intimacy.
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It implies a closeness with the Lord.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And so, the question that we have to ask ourselves this morning,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   if we want true strength and true courage with regards to our faith,
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   do we seek after the presence of God in our lives?
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   Is the presence of God real?
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   And as I was thinking about this question, it kind of led me to a book that I read a while ago.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:23.000]   It's a fictional book.
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.000]   It's called, "Safely Home," by Randy Alcorn.
[00:37:26.000 --> 00:37:30.000]   And I remember just picking it up one summer while we were in China.
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.000]   We were staying at someone's apartment, and I was reading through it,
[00:37:33.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   and it really got my attention really fast, so I was trying to read it before I left.
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   Couldn't, so I had to order it and wait for it to come.
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   But it's a fictional novel that tracks the lives of these two friends.
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   This guy named Ben Fielding, who's an American, and this Chinese man named Lee Kuan.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   And their paths kind of intersect in college,
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   and Ben Fielding was a Christian, Lee Kuan wasn't.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   And so he was evangelizing to him, bringing him out to Bible studies and whatnot,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and eventually Lee Kuan confessed faith in Christ.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   Because they were in college, they eventually graduated,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and so Lee Kuan went back to China, Ben Fielding continued to live his life in America.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And the story basically tracks their lives, their faith,
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   and Ben Fielding's faith was lukewarm, and Lee Kuan began to take his faith more seriously.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   As I'm answering the question about, "Is the presence of God real in my life?"
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   In this story, there was a discussion that takes place between Ben Fielding and Lee Kuan.
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   And the discussion was over a chair.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:50.000]   There was this handcrafted chair that Lee Kuan had in his home.
[00:38:50.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   And his home wasn't the best home, it wasn't well kept,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   but this chair stood out because it was really nice.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:05.000]   And so Ben Fielding was like, "How come no one sits in that chair?"
[00:39:05.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   You have all these people over at your house for church, but no one sits in that chair.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   How come?
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   And so Lee Kuan would like, you know, throughout the story would like kind of tell them,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "You're not ready yet for the answer, you're not ready yet for the answer."
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:24.000]   But finally he gives them the answer.
[00:39:24.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   And this is what Lee Kuan writes.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:37.000]   "But most important, this chair is a remembrance of Jesus' promise to always be with his children.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   At every meal we have, we remember he is with us.
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   When we sit in the evening, when we go to sleep at night,
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   we remember he is there watching over us no matter what."
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   When I read that passage, what struck me so deeply was this man's faith.
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   That he actually believed that Christ's presence was in that chair.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   That he believed that the reality of Christ's presence was much more real
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   than the air he breathed, the food he ate, the people he interacted with.
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   It's not enough to acknowledge that God's presence exists in this world.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:31.000]   As Christians, do we desire to actually believe the presence of God is more real
[00:40:31.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   than what we see, feel, touch, or smell in this world?
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Is it real? And do you desire it to be real?
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   I think of when we go to Acts chapter 7 and the account with Stephen and him being executed.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   I was kind of reminded of this, that as he's about to be stoned in Acts chapter 7 verse 55, it says,
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   "But he, full of the Holy Spirit, gazed into heaven and saw the glory of God
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   and Jesus standing at the right hand of God.
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   And he said, 'Behold, I see the heavens opened and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God.'"
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   I mean, at that moment, the presence of Christ was real to Stephen. He saw it.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   Hebrews chapter 12 reminds us to fix our gaze upon Jesus. Not facts about Jesus,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   not the doctrine of Jesus, but Jesus himself.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   So the question that I'm asking myself and I want to ask you guys too is,
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   do you desire to see the presence of Christ being real in your life?
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Psalm 105 verse 4 says, "Seek the Lord in his strength. Seek his presence continually."
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   When the New Year rolls around, I don't know about you guys,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   but I want the presence of Christ to be so real.
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I want it to be more real than Jen and with Haddon.
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   I want him to be that real in my life.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   Because when Haddon grows up, I don't want him to view Jesus as some sort of fairy tale
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:20.000]   or some invisible being.
[00:42:20.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   I want him to know that the presence of Christ is real.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   As we conclude, I want us to look at these three observations again.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   I want us to understand that these observations are interlinked.
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:44.000]   You have humility, you have God's word, and you have the presence of God.
[00:42:44.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   You can't be proud and still claim to be in the presence of God.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   It just doesn't work that way.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   God opposes the proud but gives grace to the humble.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:03.000]   The absence of the word, when you're not in the word meditating on day and night,
[00:43:03.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   you cannot remain humble and dependent upon God.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:12.000]   If there's an absence of the presence of God in your life,
[00:43:12.000 --> 00:43:18.000]   it will surely create a divide when it comes to reading his word.
[00:43:18.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   It becomes more academic than really an act of worship and devotion.
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   As we close this message, I really want you guys to consider those three aspects
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   and to look where are you strong in, where are you weak in.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   Come before the Lord and say, "God, sometimes I don't think you're real."
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:45.000]   Or, "Sometimes maybe I don't feel your presence."
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   Instead of just giving up in that pursuit,
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   maybe there's a need for us to wait quietly until the presence of God comes into our lives.
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:44:02.000]   Or if you're a proud individual, maybe you need humility in your life. Pray for that.
[00:44:02.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   Or if you need more time to study the word, ask God for that time.
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   But whatever it may be, as we just bow our heads for this moment,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   really pray and ask God for help in one of those areas
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   so that we can be strong and courageous.
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:26.000]   There are going to be times coming up in the new year that you expect.
[00:44:26.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   There will be times where it will be unexpected.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   You know, blessings, tragedies, we don't know.
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   But what we do know is we need strength and we need courage no matter what.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:42.000]   And so take some time to pray as the Praise Team leads us in a time of response.
