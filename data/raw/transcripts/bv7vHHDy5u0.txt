[00:11:02.600 --> 00:11:04.600]   and welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:11:04.600 --> 00:11:07.600]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:11:07.600 --> 00:11:12.600]   Next Sunday at 12.30, we have a newcomer's lunch.
[00:11:12.600 --> 00:11:15.600]   This is for those people who are coming to the church
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:18.600]   or want to find out more about what we believe
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:19.600]   and how we practice church,
[00:11:19.600 --> 00:11:21.600]   and just even meet with some of the leaders
[00:11:21.600 --> 00:11:23.600]   and welcome team members.
[00:11:23.600 --> 00:11:26.600]   And we'll have a brief presentation about the church,
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:28.600]   and then there'll be a time to ask questions,
[00:11:28.600 --> 00:11:29.600]   if you have any questions about the church.
[00:11:29.600 --> 00:11:32.600]   So that's happening next Sunday at 12.30 p.m.
[00:11:32.600 --> 00:11:34.600]   So you can just visit the welcome table
[00:11:34.600 --> 00:11:36.600]   and let them know you're coming,
[00:11:36.600 --> 00:11:37.600]   or just one of the welcome members,
[00:11:37.600 --> 00:11:38.600]   and just let them know you're coming
[00:11:38.600 --> 00:11:41.600]   so they can prepare food for that next Sunday.
[00:11:41.600 --> 00:11:44.600]   Reformation Night on October 31st.
[00:11:44.600 --> 00:11:47.600]   If you are planning to bring your child or children to that,
[00:11:47.600 --> 00:11:48.600]   please sign up for that
[00:11:48.600 --> 00:11:50.600]   so that they can better prepare for food.
[00:11:50.600 --> 00:11:54.600]   There will be food prepared for the children that are coming,
[00:11:54.600 --> 00:11:57.600]   and so I think it is open to the parents too.
[00:11:57.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   I'm not exactly sure,
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:01.600]   but at least the children will be fed, okay?
[00:12:01.600 --> 00:12:03.600]   So please sign up for that so they can better prepare,
[00:12:03.600 --> 00:12:05.600]   and also for Thanksgiving, regional dinner
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:06.600]   that's happening in November.
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:07.600]   If you haven't signed up for it,
[00:12:07.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   please sign up for it as soon as possible
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:12.600]   so we can direct you to the right place, okay?
[00:12:12.600 --> 00:12:15.600]   One other announcement.
[00:12:15.600 --> 00:12:18.600]   Because our room is getting filled, right,
[00:12:18.600 --> 00:12:22.600]   and last Sunday we had--
[00:12:22.600 --> 00:12:25.600]   I think the room capacity is about 550,
[00:12:25.600 --> 00:12:27.600]   and we had about 520 in the room,
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:31.600]   and so we're trying to push more people to the first service.
[00:12:31.600 --> 00:12:33.600]   So if you were kind of on the fence
[00:12:33.600 --> 00:12:35.600]   on I can go to the first service or second service,
[00:12:35.600 --> 00:12:37.600]   and you're trying to choose,
[00:12:37.600 --> 00:12:40.600]   if you can, volunteer to go to first service.
[00:12:40.600 --> 00:12:43.600]   We're trying to help us with the room capacity here,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.600]   and soon--we don't have an exact date,
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:47.600]   but those of you who are parents
[00:12:47.600 --> 00:12:49.600]   who have young children in SEEDS
[00:12:49.600 --> 00:12:51.600]   and also in the elementary department,
[00:12:51.600 --> 00:12:53.600]   that we are planning to open up the elementary department
[00:12:53.600 --> 00:12:54.600]   also for the first service,
[00:12:54.600 --> 00:12:59.600]   just maybe for the first half of the elementary department.
[00:12:59.600 --> 00:13:01.600]   If there is a need, it might be more than that,
[00:13:01.600 --> 00:13:03.600]   but at least for the first three grades
[00:13:03.600 --> 00:13:04.600]   of the elementary department.
[00:13:04.600 --> 00:13:06.600]   So if you have children in the SEEDS department
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:07.600]   and you have an older sibling
[00:13:07.600 --> 00:13:09.600]   who's in the elementary department,
[00:13:09.600 --> 00:13:10.600]   you can choose to go to the first service,
[00:13:10.600 --> 00:13:12.600]   and that'll help us with some of the space here.
[00:13:12.600 --> 00:13:15.600]   And we're hoping to hold off on third service
[00:13:15.600 --> 00:13:17.600]   as long as possible,
[00:13:17.600 --> 00:13:19.600]   and so eventually it might be inevitable,
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:20.600]   but at least for now,
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:22.600]   we're trying to even out the services to first service.
[00:13:22.600 --> 00:13:24.600]   So if you're able to do that,
[00:13:24.600 --> 00:13:27.600]   we encourage you to do that to go to the first service.
[00:13:27.600 --> 00:13:28.600]   Okay?
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:31.600]   All right, so after the offering,
[00:13:31.600 --> 00:13:33.600]   our brother Brandon is going to come up,
[00:13:33.600 --> 00:13:35.600]   and he's going to give his testimony
[00:13:35.600 --> 00:13:36.600]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:13:36.600 --> 00:13:38.600]   So let me pray for us, and again,
[00:13:38.600 --> 00:13:41.600]   if you're going to pay, give offering electronically,
[00:13:41.600 --> 00:13:43.600]   you can go through Zelle,
[00:13:43.600 --> 00:13:45.600]   and if you brought a physical offering,
[00:13:45.600 --> 00:13:47.600]   there's a box in the back on the way out.
[00:13:47.600 --> 00:13:51.600]   All right? Let's pray.
[00:13:51.600 --> 00:13:54.600]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much
[00:13:54.600 --> 00:13:56.600]   for your constant grace and love
[00:13:56.600 --> 00:13:57.600]   that you pour upon us,
[00:13:57.600 --> 00:13:58.600]   the things that we know,
[00:13:58.600 --> 00:14:01.600]   the things that we are not aware of.
[00:14:01.600 --> 00:14:04.600]   I pray that every Sunday when we gather together,
[00:14:04.600 --> 00:14:06.600]   that you would renew our hearts,
[00:14:06.600 --> 00:14:08.600]   our focus, our lives, Lord God,
[00:14:08.600 --> 00:14:10.600]   that we may truly be able to live
[00:14:10.600 --> 00:14:13.600]   according to the gospel that you've given us.
[00:14:13.600 --> 00:14:14.600]   Lift up our eyes, Lord,
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.600]   that we may know where our true help comes from,
[00:14:17.600 --> 00:14:19.600]   that we may live for the things that are eternal,
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:21.600]   not for the temporal.
[00:14:21.600 --> 00:14:23.600]   We pray that you would bless this giving,
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:25.600]   may it be given joyfully,
[00:14:25.600 --> 00:14:27.600]   may it be multiplied, Father God,
[00:14:27.600 --> 00:14:28.600]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:14:28.600 --> 00:14:31.600]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[00:15:15.600 --> 00:15:17.600]   let us rise from our seats and just say hello
[00:15:17.600 --> 00:15:19.600]   and greet those around you.

[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:54.680]   (audience murmuring)
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:25:00.600]   - Hello, my name is Brandon Ng.
[00:25:00.600 --> 00:25:04.600]   I'm a second year at UCI, and this is my testimony.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.600]   I did not grow up going to church.
[00:25:07.600 --> 00:25:09.600]   Regardless, I was first exposed to Christianity
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:12.600]   when I was enrolled at my eventual home church's summer camp
[00:25:12.600 --> 00:25:14.600]   in the summer entering fourth grade.
[00:25:14.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   Although I was taught Bible stories,
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:18.600]   I didn't think too deeply about their significance.
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.600]   Rather, I entered the camp for the activities
[00:25:20.600 --> 00:25:22.600]   and because of the friends I had.
[00:25:22.600 --> 00:25:24.600]   However, during middle school,
[00:25:24.600 --> 00:25:26.600]   I found myself struggling with loneliness
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   and not feeling cared for by those around me.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:31.600]   The tipping point came when my best friend at the time
[00:25:31.600 --> 00:25:33.600]   moved away, and although I had friends,
[00:25:33.600 --> 00:25:36.600]   the relationships I had with them were superficial.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.600]   My brokenness steadily worsened,
[00:25:38.600 --> 00:25:41.600]   and all I saw was how my classmates
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:43.600]   seemed to have everything I wanted
[00:25:43.600 --> 00:25:45.600]   but lacked in friendship and community.
[00:25:45.600 --> 00:25:48.600]   Eventually, I became desensitized to my pain,
[00:25:48.600 --> 00:25:51.600]   and consequentially, didn't share my struggles with anyone,
[00:25:51.600 --> 00:25:54.600]   including my family or my church friends,
[00:25:54.600 --> 00:25:56.600]   because I felt I wasn't enough for them.
[00:25:56.600 --> 00:25:58.600]   But fortunately, a turning point came
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.600]   in the summer going to eighth grade,
[00:26:00.600 --> 00:26:02.600]   the same summer camp I had been attending for four years now.
[00:26:02.600 --> 00:26:05.600]   That year, as a middle schooler, we went on a retreat,
[00:26:05.600 --> 00:26:07.600]   and on the last night, time was designated
[00:26:07.600 --> 00:26:10.600]   for anyone to share any burdens they had before God.
[00:26:10.600 --> 00:26:12.600]   After hearing a counselor say, "God wouldn't shun us,
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:14.600]   "but instead help us,"
[00:26:14.600 --> 00:26:16.600]   I confessed my brokenness.
[00:26:16.600 --> 00:26:18.600]   But when I shared everything I had learned about God
[00:26:18.600 --> 00:26:21.600]   sounding click for me, I saw the relevance
[00:26:21.600 --> 00:26:23.600]   in knowing there was a God who loved me so much
[00:26:23.600 --> 00:26:25.600]   and would lift me up from my darkness.
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:28.600]   I saw the significance in knowing there was a God
[00:26:28.600 --> 00:26:30.600]   who sent his innocent son to die for our sins.
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:32.600]   Seeking to learn more about God,
[00:26:32.600 --> 00:26:35.600]   I began attending fellowship gatherings and Sunday service.
[00:26:35.600 --> 00:26:38.600]   But coincidentally, experiencing God's faithfulness
[00:26:38.600 --> 00:26:40.600]   inspired me to also serve him.
[00:26:40.600 --> 00:26:42.600]   I became a summer camp counselor myself
[00:26:42.600 --> 00:26:44.600]   with the hopes of sharing about God
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:46.600]   with the kids I worked with.
[00:26:46.600 --> 00:26:48.600]   But beneath the surface, my home and my church life
[00:26:48.600 --> 00:26:50.600]   contrasted each other.
[00:26:50.600 --> 00:26:52.600]   At church, I would pray and study his word.
[00:26:52.600 --> 00:26:55.600]   But at home, I didn't do any of that.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:58.600]   I also wrestled with whether I actually believed in a God.
[00:26:58.600 --> 00:27:00.600]   Although I served him, I only knew of him
[00:27:00.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   versus actually knowing him personally and abiding in him.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:05.600]   Yet soon enough, college came,
[00:27:05.600 --> 00:27:08.600]   and I shortly found myself here at Berean.
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.600]   But as the weeks passed, I struggled with feelings
[00:27:10.600 --> 00:27:12.600]   of not belonging and loneliness.
[00:27:12.600 --> 00:27:15.600]   Frustrated, I grew bitter at those around me.
[00:27:15.600 --> 00:27:17.600]   Winter quarter rolled around,
[00:27:17.600 --> 00:27:19.600]   and despite me still feeling bitter,
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.600]   I continued attending church.
[00:27:21.600 --> 00:27:23.600]   However, I eventually opened up about my brokenness
[00:27:23.600 --> 00:27:25.600]   to some fellow students.
[00:27:25.600 --> 00:27:28.600]   Through conversations, I was supported but also rebuked.
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:30.600]   My own sins were pointed out,
[00:27:30.600 --> 00:27:32.600]   and I realized how cold my heart had become
[00:27:32.600 --> 00:27:34.600]   towards those around me.
[00:27:34.600 --> 00:27:36.600]   I had been victimizing myself all along.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.600]   Realizing how long I had been to accuse others
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:42.600]   of not caring for me, when I hadn't been caring for them,
[00:27:42.600 --> 00:27:44.600]   I sought the Lord's help in repenting
[00:27:44.600 --> 00:27:47.600]   not just for my transgressions against my fellow believers
[00:27:47.600 --> 00:27:49.600]   but ultimately against him.
[00:27:49.600 --> 00:27:53.600]   But equally as important, I recognized my depravity.
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:56.600]   I saw how God had and was keeping me
[00:27:56.600 --> 00:27:58.600]   from falling deeper into my own sin
[00:27:58.600 --> 00:28:00.600]   and guiding me towards his light instead.
[00:28:00.600 --> 00:28:03.600]   Recognizing this, I desired to put my faith in him.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:06.600]   Experiencing his love, grace, and kindness
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:08.600]   inspires me not to walk in darkness
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:10.600]   but in his light.
[00:28:10.600 --> 00:28:12.600]   1 John 1, 6-7 says,
[00:28:12.600 --> 00:28:14.600]   "It will be said we have fellowship with him,
[00:28:14.600 --> 00:28:16.600]   and yet walk in darkness.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:18.600]   We lie and do not practice the truth,
[00:28:18.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   but it will be walked in the light,
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.600]   as he himself is in the light.
[00:28:22.600 --> 00:28:24.600]   We have fellowship with one another,
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:26.600]   and the blood of Jesus, his Son,
[00:28:26.600 --> 00:28:28.600]   cleanses us from all sin."
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:31.600]   Yet, I'm also reminded of how solely powerful his grace is,
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   despite my continuous battles against my own sin.
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:37.600]   2 Corinthians 12, verse 9 says,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:39.600]   "My grace is sufficient for you,
[00:28:39.600 --> 00:28:42.600]   for my power is made perfect in weakness.
[00:28:42.600 --> 00:28:44.600]   And yet most gladly, therefore,
[00:28:44.600 --> 00:28:46.600]   I will brighter boast my weaknesses,
[00:28:46.600 --> 00:28:49.600]   so that the power of Christ may dwell in me."
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:51.600]   Praise the Lord and Savior for how loving,
[00:28:51.600 --> 00:28:54.600]   faithful, and gracious he has been to me.
[00:28:54.600 --> 00:28:57.600]   Because of him, I recognize him as the Lord and Savior of my life.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:28:59.600]   Thank you.
[00:28:59.600 --> 00:29:09.600]   [applause]
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:21.600]   Friend, do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:23.600]   you're being united with Christ's death,
[00:29:23.600 --> 00:29:26.600]   and then when you're coming out, you're united to Christ's resurrected life?
[00:29:26.600 --> 00:29:27.600]   I do.
[00:29:27.600 --> 00:29:29.600]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:29:29.600 --> 00:29:30.600]   the Son,
[00:29:30.600 --> 00:29:32.600]   and the Holy Spirit.
[00:29:32.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   [applause]
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:52.600]   All right, thank you, Brandon, for that encouraging testimony.
[00:29:52.600 --> 00:29:56.600]   If you can turn your Bible with me to Luke, chapter 6,
[00:29:56.600 --> 00:30:00.600]   and we'll be looking at from verse 27 to 38.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.600]   Okay?
[00:30:02.600 --> 00:30:06.600]   Luke, chapter 6, verse 27 through 38.
[00:30:06.600 --> 00:30:08.600]   Reading out of the NASV.
[00:30:08.600 --> 00:30:10.600]   "For I say to you who hear, love your enemies,
[00:30:10.600 --> 00:30:12.600]   do good to those who hate you,
[00:30:12.600 --> 00:30:15.600]   bless those who curse you, pray for those who mistreat you.
[00:30:15.600 --> 00:30:18.600]   Whoever hits you on the cheek, offer him the other also,
[00:30:18.600 --> 00:30:20.600]   and whoever takes away your coat,
[00:30:20.600 --> 00:30:23.600]   do not withhold your shirt from him either.
[00:30:23.600 --> 00:30:25.600]   Give to everyone who asks of you,
[00:30:25.600 --> 00:30:28.600]   and whoever takes away what is yours, do not demand it back.
[00:30:28.600 --> 00:30:31.600]   Treat others the same way you want them to treat you.
[00:30:31.600 --> 00:30:34.600]   If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[00:30:34.600 --> 00:30:37.600]   For even sinners love those who love them.
[00:30:37.600 --> 00:30:39.600]   If you do good to those who do good to you,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:40.600]   what credit is that to you?
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:42.600]   For even sinners do the same.
[00:30:42.600 --> 00:30:45.600]   If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive,
[00:30:45.600 --> 00:30:47.600]   what credit is that to you?
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:51.600]   Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount.
[00:30:51.600 --> 00:30:52.600]   But love your enemies and do good,
[00:30:52.600 --> 00:30:54.600]   and lend expecting nothing in return,
[00:30:54.600 --> 00:30:56.600]   and your reward will be great,
[00:30:56.600 --> 00:30:58.600]   and you will be sons of the Most High,
[00:30:58.600 --> 00:31:01.600]   for he himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men.
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:04.600]   Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful.
[00:31:04.600 --> 00:31:06.600]   Do not judge, and you will not be judged,
[00:31:06.600 --> 00:31:09.600]   and do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.
[00:31:09.600 --> 00:31:11.600]   Pardon, and you will be pardoned.
[00:31:11.600 --> 00:31:13.600]   Give, and it will be given to you.
[00:31:13.600 --> 00:31:15.600]   They will pour into your lap a good measure,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:17.600]   pressed down, shaken together, and running over.
[00:31:17.600 --> 00:31:19.600]   For by your standard of measure,
[00:31:19.600 --> 00:31:21.600]   it will be measured to you in return.
[00:31:21.600 --> 00:31:22.600]   Let's pray.
[00:31:22.600 --> 00:31:28.600]   Father, we thank you for the challenge
[00:31:28.600 --> 00:31:31.600]   and the inspiration of your word.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:34.600]   We pray, Father God, that you give us understanding
[00:31:34.600 --> 00:31:38.600]   and eagerness to apply all that we hear.
[00:31:38.600 --> 00:31:41.600]   May your name be honored.
[00:31:41.600 --> 00:31:43.600]   May Christ be exalted.
[00:31:43.600 --> 00:31:48.600]   May love that you poured upon us would overflow back to you.
[00:31:48.600 --> 00:31:50.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:31:50.600 --> 00:31:55.600]   So as we've been talking about loving your enemies, right?
[00:31:55.600 --> 00:31:59.600]   And it sounds great when we talk about how Christ loved us,
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:01.600]   and we're in a Bible study,
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:04.600]   and how great his love is unconditional,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.600]   and every time we have a wedding, you know,
[00:32:07.600 --> 00:32:09.600]   sermon about love and unconditional love
[00:32:09.600 --> 00:32:11.600]   that we need to practice, covenant love
[00:32:11.600 --> 00:32:13.600]   that we need to practice with one another.
[00:32:13.600 --> 00:32:19.600]   And when that is a--just a picture or an idea
[00:32:19.600 --> 00:32:23.600]   that we have to practice, it's beautiful.
[00:32:23.600 --> 00:32:26.600]   But if you are sitting here,
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.600]   and we're talking about loving your enemy,
[00:32:29.600 --> 00:32:33.600]   and you have somebody specific in mind, right?
[00:32:33.600 --> 00:32:35.600]   Maybe somebody has wronged you.
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:36.600]   Maybe it was a group of people.
[00:32:36.600 --> 00:32:38.600]   Maybe it was a previous church that you came from.
[00:32:38.600 --> 00:32:41.600]   Maybe it might be your own husband or wife,
[00:32:41.600 --> 00:32:44.600]   or even your own children, family member.
[00:32:44.600 --> 00:32:46.600]   If you have somebody specifically in mind,
[00:32:46.600 --> 00:32:49.600]   and you're thinking, "You don't know what I've gone through.
[00:32:49.600 --> 00:32:51.600]   You don't know what they did to me."
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:55.600]   And let alone wanting to take out vengeance against them,
[00:32:55.600 --> 00:32:57.600]   but to love them, to lend to them,
[00:32:57.600 --> 00:33:02.600]   to give and be good to them, to bless them, pray for them.
[00:33:02.600 --> 00:33:04.600]   Does God really expect us to practice that?
[00:33:04.600 --> 00:33:08.600]   Maybe he's talking about, you know, other people.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:10.600]   Maybe he's just talking about the love of Christ,
[00:33:10.600 --> 00:33:13.600]   but to have us actually practice that.
[00:33:13.600 --> 00:33:14.600]   And as we've been talking about,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.600]   there's nothing more sanctifying,
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:19.600]   nothing more that kills our pride.
[00:33:19.600 --> 00:33:22.600]   There's nothing that kills our old self
[00:33:22.600 --> 00:33:27.600]   more than even an attempt or even a thought of practicing this.
[00:33:27.600 --> 00:33:32.600]   This is one of those things that you just cannot do in your flesh.
[00:33:32.600 --> 00:33:33.600]   You can pray in your flesh.
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:34.600]   You can study the Bible in your flesh.
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.600]   You can serve in the flesh.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:38.600]   You can even be generous in your flesh,
[00:33:38.600 --> 00:33:41.600]   but to love the way Christ loved us
[00:33:41.600 --> 00:33:43.600]   is not something you can do in the flesh.
[00:33:43.600 --> 00:33:45.600]   You can tell right away if you're walking in the flesh
[00:33:45.600 --> 00:33:47.600]   and walking in the spirit
[00:33:47.600 --> 00:33:51.600]   when you try to even attempt to practice this.
[00:33:51.600 --> 00:33:55.600]   This morning, we're going to be looking at the text that we're at,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:34:01.600]   and Jesus gives the reasons behind why this must be practiced.
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:02.600]   That this is not just an example.
[00:34:02.600 --> 00:34:04.600]   This is not just something for us to be celebrated,
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:06.600]   but to actually be practiced.
[00:34:06.600 --> 00:34:10.600]   He expects us to practice this, and he gives us four reasons,
[00:34:10.600 --> 00:34:13.600]   and I'm going to give the fifth reason as a wrap-up
[00:34:13.600 --> 00:34:14.600]   of why this needs to be practiced.
[00:34:14.600 --> 00:34:17.600]   So the first thing that he tells us why this needs to be practiced
[00:34:17.600 --> 00:34:23.600]   is that there will be times when you are in need of that same grace.
[00:34:23.600 --> 00:34:26.600]   There will be times in your life where you desire
[00:34:26.600 --> 00:34:29.600]   and you need someone to be gracious with you.
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.600]   He says, Luke 6:31,
[00:34:31.600 --> 00:34:36.600]   "Treat others the same way you want them to treat you."
[00:34:36.600 --> 00:34:41.600]   We have a tendency to practice grace
[00:34:41.600 --> 00:34:43.600]   or want people to practice grace with us,
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.600]   but if somebody's wronged us, we demand justice.
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:49.600]   I mean, turn the other cheek.
[00:34:49.600 --> 00:34:50.600]   Are you serious?
[00:34:50.600 --> 00:34:53.600]   Do you have any idea what they've done to me?
[00:34:53.600 --> 00:34:55.600]   The things that they said, and they want me harm,
[00:34:55.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   and you want me to do good to them?
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:02.600]   When it comes to ourselves, we desire--
[00:35:02.600 --> 00:35:05.600]   in fact, only in the church, and I mentioned this before--
[00:35:05.600 --> 00:35:08.600]   only in the church where people demand grace.
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:12.600]   You walk into a church, and they're not gracious to me.
[00:35:12.600 --> 00:35:18.600]   The idea of grace is getting what you do not deserve.
[00:35:18.600 --> 00:35:21.600]   So when we demand grace, what we are saying is,
[00:35:21.600 --> 00:35:25.600]   "I can't believe these people are not giving me what I don't deserve.
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:28.600]   What kind of a church is this?
[00:35:28.600 --> 00:35:33.600]   I can't believe that person wouldn't give me what I did not earn.
[00:35:33.600 --> 00:35:35.600]   What kind of a church is this?"
[00:35:35.600 --> 00:35:38.600]   Only in the church do we have a culture
[00:35:38.600 --> 00:35:42.600]   where people expect grace from people.
[00:35:42.600 --> 00:35:46.600]   The idea of grace is you don't deserve it.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   In fact, I've actually even heard people say this,
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:51.600]   as ridiculous as this is,
[00:35:51.600 --> 00:35:56.600]   "I can't stand people who don't practice grace."
[00:35:56.600 --> 00:36:00.600]   As foolish as that sounds, I've heard that from many people.
[00:36:00.600 --> 00:36:04.600]   The fact that you demand grace, and then that you refuse to be gracious
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:10.600]   to somebody who doesn't practice grace is a contradiction.
[00:36:10.600 --> 00:36:14.600]   It says there's going to be times when you may be in a position
[00:36:14.600 --> 00:36:17.600]   where you are in need of grace.
[00:36:17.600 --> 00:36:24.600]   Oftentimes, the people that we think are enemies are not enemies.
[00:36:24.600 --> 00:36:26.600]   And the way conflicts happen is you did something,
[00:36:26.600 --> 00:36:29.600]   and somebody perceived what you have done in a certain way,
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:32.600]   and then as a result of that, they react to you,
[00:36:32.600 --> 00:36:35.600]   and then they react to you, and you perceive the way that they're reacting,
[00:36:35.600 --> 00:36:36.600]   and then you react back to them.
[00:36:36.600 --> 00:36:39.600]   Next thing you know, you're in a fight.
[00:36:39.600 --> 00:36:41.600]   Next thing you know.
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:45.600]   And this happens between husband and wives all the time.
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:47.600]   You're fighting each other, and you don't even know what you're fighting about.
[00:36:47.600 --> 00:36:50.600]   You're fighting about the way you're fighting.
[00:36:50.600 --> 00:36:53.600]   "I can't believe you said that. You never do this, and you always do that."
[00:36:53.600 --> 00:36:55.600]   And they say, "What were we fighting about? I don't know,
[00:36:55.600 --> 00:36:59.600]   but I can't believe they said it the way that they said it."
[00:36:59.600 --> 00:37:01.600]   Oftentimes, it's the way we perceive it.
[00:37:01.600 --> 00:37:06.600]   It's like, "Well, you know, that person did this, but I almost guarantee,"
[00:37:06.600 --> 00:37:08.600]   you know, they say, "Well, they've done this to me.
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.600]   I guarantee if you ask the person on the other side,
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:13.600]   they're going to say the same thing about you."
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.600]   You don't know what they did. You don't know what they've said.
[00:37:16.600 --> 00:37:21.600]   So when we do not practice grace, it has a tendency to overflow into a bigger issue.
[00:37:21.600 --> 00:37:27.600]   In Matthew 7, 12, "In everything, therefore, treat people the same way you want to be treated.
[00:37:27.600 --> 00:37:30.600]   For this is the law and the prophets."
[00:37:30.600 --> 00:37:32.600]   This is the law and the prophets. Everything that God has taught us,
[00:37:32.600 --> 00:37:34.600]   to love God, love your neighbor as yourself,
[00:37:34.600 --> 00:37:37.600]   He said it would be summarized by this, right?
[00:37:37.600 --> 00:37:41.600]   To love all the prophets, everything that God had commanded.
[00:37:41.600 --> 00:37:47.600]   Everything that God had commanded can be summarized, right?
[00:37:47.600 --> 00:37:51.600]   Treat people the way you want to be treated.
[00:37:51.600 --> 00:37:54.600]   If you want grace, practice grace.
[00:37:54.600 --> 00:37:58.600]   If you want people to be merciful to you, practice mercy.
[00:37:58.600 --> 00:38:02.600]   In Galatians 5, 13-14, it says, "For you are called to freedom, brethren.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.600]   Only do not turn your freedom into an opportunity for the flesh,
[00:38:06.600 --> 00:38:09.600]   but through love serve one another."
[00:38:09.600 --> 00:38:15.600]   You know, I don't know if you may have been in circles where you're talking about Christian liberty, right?
[00:38:15.600 --> 00:38:18.600]   And say, "Well, because we have Christian liberty, the gray areas doesn't matter.
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:21.600]   I'm going to do whatever I want because I'm not legalistic.
[00:38:21.600 --> 00:38:23.600]   So I can do whatever I want."
[00:38:23.600 --> 00:38:26.600]   So if you have a problem with that, you're the younger brother.
[00:38:26.600 --> 00:38:28.600]   You're the weaker brother.
[00:38:28.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   The more mature brother, it doesn't bother him.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:32.600]   I can do all this, it doesn't bother me.
[00:38:32.600 --> 00:38:38.600]   I mean, you're talking about a perversion of the doctrine of freedom in the Bible.
[00:38:38.600 --> 00:38:41.600]   He says, "Do not use your freedom to indulge yourself."
[00:38:41.600 --> 00:38:44.600]   The freedom wasn't given for you.
[00:38:44.600 --> 00:38:46.600]   He said the freedom was given for what?
[00:38:46.600 --> 00:38:49.600]   But through love serve one another.
[00:38:49.600 --> 00:38:51.600]   That we're no longer bound.
[00:38:51.600 --> 00:38:55.600]   And as a result of that, we can love other people much more graciously.
[00:38:55.600 --> 00:38:57.600]   We can be more merciful.
[00:38:57.600 --> 00:38:59.600]   We can be more gentle.
[00:38:59.600 --> 00:39:02.600]   He said our freedom was given to us so that we can practice what?
[00:39:02.600 --> 00:39:04.600]   Just love.
[00:39:04.600 --> 00:39:07.600]   In verse 14, "For the whole law is fulfilled in one word in the statement,
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:11.600]   'You shall love your neighbor as yourself.'"
[00:39:11.600 --> 00:39:15.600]   We live in a culture where we are told you got to love yourself first.
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:16.600]   Love yourself.
[00:39:16.600 --> 00:39:17.600]   Believe in yourself.
[00:39:17.600 --> 00:39:20.600]   Love yourself or else you're not going to be able to love other people.
[00:39:20.600 --> 00:39:24.600]   You notice in the Bible, it's assumed that you love yourself.
[00:39:24.600 --> 00:39:28.600]   You don't have to try hard, "I got to love myself.
[00:39:28.600 --> 00:39:31.600]   I got to pay attention to myself."
[00:39:31.600 --> 00:39:32.600]   You already do that.
[00:39:32.600 --> 00:39:33.600]   It's innately in you.
[00:39:33.600 --> 00:39:38.600]   As soon as you're born, you're born with selfishness.
[00:39:38.600 --> 00:39:41.600]   You don't care that your mom just labored for 25 hours
[00:39:41.600 --> 00:39:43.600]   and you don't come out thinking like, "You know what?
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:47.600]   Maybe I can eat later because my parents need some rest."
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   You don't come out unselfish thinking about your parents.
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:52.600]   At the moment, it doesn't matter.
[00:39:52.600 --> 00:39:55.600]   You came out, "I'm hungry."
[00:39:55.600 --> 00:39:59.600]   Your mama had a C-section, drugged up, and was in the hospital bed for three days.
[00:39:59.600 --> 00:40:01.600]   "I'm hungry."
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:04.600]   That's how you come into the world.
[00:40:04.600 --> 00:40:06.600]   And that's how you exist in the world.
[00:40:06.600 --> 00:40:10.600]   Me, even the way we practice love for one another, it's me.
[00:40:10.600 --> 00:40:14.600]   How are you going to reciprocate what I give to you?
[00:40:14.600 --> 00:40:19.600]   But he says to love as you would love yourself.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:23.600]   I remember as a young Christian in my late teens, I really wrestled with this.
[00:40:23.600 --> 00:40:26.600]   What does it mean to love as myself?
[00:40:26.600 --> 00:40:30.600]   I think the best and the closest way that I could think of is figure out
[00:40:30.600 --> 00:40:32.600]   what I genuinely love.
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:36.600]   At that time, I was thinking about, "Do I love the way I love my mom?
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:38.600]   Do I love the way I love my dad?
[00:40:38.600 --> 00:40:40.600]   Do I love the way I love my brothers?"
[00:40:40.600 --> 00:40:42.600]   I was always trying to apply that.
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:44.600]   It's like, "Oh, am I practicing love?
[00:40:44.600 --> 00:40:46.600]   Would I do this if this was my brother?
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   Would I do this if this was my mom or dad?"
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:55.600]   That would immediately tell me if I'm actually practicing what Christ told me to do as yourself.
[00:40:55.600 --> 00:40:59.600]   As I got older, obviously, I experienced different things.
[00:40:59.600 --> 00:41:03.600]   I got married, and my relationship with Esther--
[00:41:03.600 --> 00:41:05.600]   there are times, and those of you who have been married for a while,
[00:41:05.600 --> 00:41:08.600]   you know that there's--especially in the beginning, right?
[00:41:08.600 --> 00:41:14.600]   Our communication skills, I would say from 1 to 10 was 1.
[00:41:14.600 --> 00:41:18.600]   When things were good, we don't need communication.
[00:41:18.600 --> 00:41:20.600]   We're having fun. We're doing ministry together.
[00:41:20.600 --> 00:41:24.600]   But when things are bad, the way Esther communicated, the way I communicated,
[00:41:24.600 --> 00:41:27.600]   we were in two opposite parts of the world
[00:41:27.600 --> 00:41:32.600]   because the way she communicates is to disappear.
[00:41:32.600 --> 00:41:36.600]   The way I communicate, like with my brother, we hit each other and get on the floor.
[00:41:36.600 --> 00:41:41.600]   I can't do that with my wife, but that's the way I communicated.
[00:41:41.600 --> 00:41:44.600]   We get in a nasty fight, we punch each other, and the next day we're having breakfast together.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:46.600]   That's kind of how I grew up.
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:51.600]   And obviously, I can't practice with my wife, so I was overly aggressive when I got mad.
[00:41:51.600 --> 00:41:56.600]   Like, "I demand you to say something," and then the more I demanded, the more she would disappear.
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:42:00.600]   Just frustration after frustration.
[00:42:00.600 --> 00:42:03.600]   Like I said, when things were good, things were really good,
[00:42:03.600 --> 00:42:06.600]   but every time we got mad, it just popped back up.
[00:42:06.600 --> 00:42:09.600]   And when it was worst was when I would disappear,
[00:42:09.600 --> 00:42:12.600]   would go to missions or go speak at some church,
[00:42:12.600 --> 00:42:15.600]   and I don't see her for about 3 or 4 days, and I walk through the door tired,
[00:42:15.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   hoping to get a warm embrace, and then I see my wife looking at me with a frown,
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:25.600]   and she just walks by, and I'm projecting, "What did I do? I just did God's work.
[00:42:25.600 --> 00:42:29.600]   What did I do against God or something? What's going on?"
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:33.600]   And so that would trigger my anger, and then I would demand her to communicate,
[00:42:33.600 --> 00:42:35.600]   "How can you do this to me?"
[00:42:35.600 --> 00:42:39.600]   And the more she saw how angry I was, she would just disappear and go to sleep.
[00:42:39.600 --> 00:42:41.600]   And the more that she would sleep, the more frustrated I would get.
[00:42:41.600 --> 00:42:47.600]   And I don't know how many times I sat by myself, just seething in anger.
[00:42:47.600 --> 00:42:52.600]   And it got to the point where, in my mind,
[00:42:52.600 --> 00:42:57.600]   I would never consider divorce because that would ruin my life.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.600]   I would have to deny Christ before I even think about that.
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:05.600]   But I could understand why people get to that point,
[00:43:05.600 --> 00:43:09.600]   when it's that miserable, and it's in your own home.
[00:43:09.600 --> 00:43:14.600]   And sometimes the person that you feel like is hurting you the most
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:19.600]   is your own wife or your own husband, even your own kids.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:23.600]   And when pain comes from somebody that is that close to you,
[00:43:23.600 --> 00:43:26.600]   it is more painful than anything else outside.
[00:43:26.600 --> 00:43:32.600]   And I remember sitting there thinking, "Man, how am I going to do ministry like this?
[00:43:32.600 --> 00:43:35.600]   We're not running together."
[00:43:35.600 --> 00:43:37.600]   And I remember sitting there thinking,
[00:43:37.600 --> 00:43:41.600]   "This is years and years after being married and having our kids."
[00:43:41.600 --> 00:43:46.600]   I sat there, again, memorizing Galatians 2, 20, "Be crucified. Be crucified.
[00:43:46.600 --> 00:43:48.600]   Take yourself out of the picture.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.600]   Don't talk about, like, 'This is not fair. It's unjust.'
[00:43:51.600 --> 00:43:53.600]   And, 'How can she do this to me? I'm doing God's work.
[00:43:53.600 --> 00:43:56.600]   I just came back from mission. How can she be treating me this way?'"
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.600]   So take yourself out of the picture. Die to yourself first.
[00:44:00.600 --> 00:44:03.600]   And then I said, "Well, how should I approach her?"
[00:44:03.600 --> 00:44:09.600]   And I start thinking, "What if she was my daughter?
[00:44:09.600 --> 00:44:12.600]   How would I approach her if she was my daughter?"
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:15.600]   And obviously I was thinking, "If my daughter--
[00:44:15.600 --> 00:44:22.600]   if Faith did something and I was angry, I wouldn't say, 'It's not fair.
[00:44:22.600 --> 00:44:29.600]   I did this to you, and you're going to do--it's not fair, Faith.'"
[00:44:29.600 --> 00:44:33.600]   I was like, "I can't say that to my daughter."
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:37.600]   Faith has never caused me trouble, so I've never had to do that before.
[00:44:37.600 --> 00:44:40.600]   But I was just imagining in my head, if that was my wife,
[00:44:40.600 --> 00:44:42.600]   if that was my daughter, how would I approach her?
[00:44:42.600 --> 00:44:45.600]   So my immediate thought was, "Whatever you say and do,
[00:44:45.600 --> 00:44:49.600]   you have to do it for her, not for you."
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.600]   So I said, "I'm going to approach her like I would approach my daughter."
[00:44:53.600 --> 00:44:55.600]   And then I went, and then she would be seething,
[00:44:55.600 --> 00:45:00.600]   and then I sat down, and instead of saying, "Whoa, whoa, whoa, what did I do?"
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:04.600]   That's typically how the argument would start, right?
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.600]   I sat there and put my arms around her.
[00:45:07.600 --> 00:45:13.600]   She seemed upset, and I was showing grace, only externally, though.
[00:45:13.600 --> 00:45:18.600]   Internally, I was like, "What? How dare you?"
[00:45:18.600 --> 00:45:21.600]   I had all kinds of yelling in my head, but I was like, "Don't say anything.
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:23.600]   Don't say anything."
[00:45:23.600 --> 00:45:27.600]   And I just put my arms around her, and as soon as she felt safe,
[00:45:27.600 --> 00:45:30.600]   I showed her care.
[00:45:30.600 --> 00:45:31.600]   I could tell.
[00:45:31.600 --> 00:45:34.600]   Usually, she would start looking this way, and I'm sitting here.
[00:45:34.600 --> 00:45:37.600]   Her body would slowly turn this way,
[00:45:37.600 --> 00:45:41.600]   and then eventually, if we're sitting in the car, she's just looking out the window.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.600]   Or if it gets bad enough, she'll just slowly get up and put her shoes on and go outside.
[00:45:46.600 --> 00:45:49.600]   That's usually how our arguments would end.
[00:45:49.600 --> 00:45:53.600]   But I just put my hand around her, and then she just slowly started turning this way,
[00:45:53.600 --> 00:45:58.600]   and I was like, "Oh, something strange is happening."
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.600]   And then next thing I know, she kind of leans over to me and puts her head on my shoulder,
[00:46:02.600 --> 00:46:06.600]   and I'm like, "I don't know what to do."
[00:46:06.600 --> 00:46:08.600]   Because I've never experienced this before.
[00:46:08.600 --> 00:46:12.600]   All the years that I've been approaching her, this is not what I was expecting.
[00:46:12.600 --> 00:46:17.600]   And then once she put her head down, I'm like, "Okay, I have no idea what she's thinking,
[00:46:17.600 --> 00:46:21.600]   but I'm no longer angry because I don't see her angry anymore."
[00:46:21.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   And then when she was ready, when she felt safe, she would tell me,
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.600]   and then a lot of times, it had nothing to do with me.
[00:46:27.600 --> 00:46:31.600]   The kids were acting up, or she got a phone call, or something happened,
[00:46:31.600 --> 00:46:35.600]   and she was expecting me to come and be an encouragement to her.
[00:46:35.600 --> 00:46:40.600]   But as soon as I saw that rigid face, I'm like, "What?"
[00:46:40.600 --> 00:46:45.600]   I was like, "Four days on the mission field, I came home for a warm embrace,
[00:46:45.600 --> 00:46:49.600]   and she's waiting for me to give her a warm embrace because she had such a hard time
[00:46:49.600 --> 00:46:52.600]   taking care of the kids while I wasn't home."
[00:46:52.600 --> 00:46:57.600]   And then I react to her, she reacts to me, and next thing we know, we're fighting.
[00:46:57.600 --> 00:47:01.600]   And what we fight is just dead silence.
[00:47:01.600 --> 00:47:11.600]   And that small act of choosing to love her, despite what I was feeling,
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:14.600]   completely changed our marriage.
[00:47:14.600 --> 00:47:18.600]   I can tell you specifically, that changed my marriage.
[00:47:18.600 --> 00:47:22.600]   People talk about how we're equal partners in marriage.
[00:47:22.600 --> 00:47:26.600]   We're not equal partners. I am the leader in this home.
[00:47:26.600 --> 00:47:30.600]   The Bible tells the wife to submit to the husband.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:32.600]   We're not equal.
[00:47:32.600 --> 00:47:37.600]   But when most people hear that, they hear it from a sinful perspective.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.600]   It means they're better, they're going to rule over you.
[00:47:40.600 --> 00:47:46.600]   No, we're not equal because God called me to be the presence of Christ in Esther's life.
[00:47:46.600 --> 00:47:50.600]   That I have to die to myself.
[00:47:50.600 --> 00:47:54.600]   I am not an equal because God has given me a greater call to sacrifice,
[00:47:54.600 --> 00:47:57.600]   to put her needs before mine,
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.600]   to make decisions that will benefit her before me,
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:08.600]   to do things that will be better for her, for my children, than for myself.
[00:48:08.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   And again, like I said, so much of human problem happens
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:22.600]   because we demand things from other people that we don't practice ourselves.
[00:48:22.600 --> 00:48:28.600]   So this is one of the most practical, life-changing things that we can practice.
[00:48:28.600 --> 00:48:31.600]   So not just to hear, not just to celebrate it, but to practice it.
[00:48:31.600 --> 00:48:34.600]   Second, we've been called to greater righteousness in the world.
[00:48:34.600 --> 00:48:37.600]   What distinguishes us from the world is this love.
[00:48:37.600 --> 00:48:41.600]   Luke 6, 32-34, "If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[00:48:41.600 --> 00:48:45.600]   For even sinners love those who love them."
[00:48:45.600 --> 00:48:46.600]   He says this three separate times.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:49.600]   "If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you?
[00:48:49.600 --> 00:48:51.600]   For even sinners do the same."
[00:48:51.600 --> 00:48:55.600]   "If you lend to those whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you?
[00:48:55.600 --> 00:49:00.600]   Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount."
[00:49:00.600 --> 00:49:02.600]   The world practices love.
[00:49:02.600 --> 00:49:04.600]   The world practices all that we practice.
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.600]   The distinguishing mark of a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:49:07.600 --> 00:49:12.600]   is the kind of love that we practice.
[00:49:12.600 --> 00:49:19.600]   Fallen, unregenerate, self-centered, selfish people practice love.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:21.600]   You don't have to be touched by the love of Christ.
[00:49:21.600 --> 00:49:25.600]   You don't have to have the Holy Spirit to practice this kind of love.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.600]   He said, "What credit is that to you when your love looks no different?"
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:33.600]   If you love those who are lovable, if you love those who will reciprocate,
[00:49:33.600 --> 00:49:39.600]   if you love those who are like you, then your love is no different.
[00:49:39.600 --> 00:49:43.600]   What distinguishes us is the kind of love that we practice.
[00:49:43.600 --> 00:49:46.600]   In Matthew 5, 20, it says, "For I say to you that unless your righteousness
[00:49:46.600 --> 00:49:52.600]   surpasses that of the scribes and the Pharisees, you will not enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:49:52.600 --> 00:49:57.600]   I'm sure you've heard that before, but I want you to meditate and think about what he's saying.
[00:49:57.600 --> 00:50:02.600]   That your righteousness is to exceed the Pharisees and the scribes.
[00:50:02.600 --> 00:50:06.600]   Pharisees and the scribes prayed more than anybody else.
[00:50:06.600 --> 00:50:09.600]   They evangelized more than anybody else.
[00:50:09.600 --> 00:50:11.600]   They gave to the poor more than anybody else.
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:13.600]   They memorized Scripture more than anybody else.
[00:50:13.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   They obeyed the Sabbath law more than anybody else.
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:23.600]   So if you listen to this superficially, it sounds like, "No, you have to pray more than them.
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:26.600]   You have to evangelize more than them. You have to give more than them.
[00:50:26.600 --> 00:50:33.600]   Whatever standard that they have set up, it's not enough, and you have to do more than that."
[00:50:33.600 --> 00:50:38.600]   But that's not what he's saying. That's not what he's saying.
[00:50:38.600 --> 00:50:41.600]   Externally, they're doing all these things.
[00:50:41.600 --> 00:50:47.600]   In Matthew 7, verse 23, it says, "Not everyone who says to Me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven."
[00:50:47.600 --> 00:50:53.600]   In other words, if lordship is just lip service, it means nothing.
[00:50:53.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   "But he who does the will of My Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:51:01.600]   Many will say to Me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in Your name?'"
[00:51:01.600 --> 00:51:05.600]   How can somebody prophesying in His name not know the Lord?
[00:51:05.600 --> 00:51:07.600]   But that's what he said.
[00:51:07.600 --> 00:51:09.600]   "And in Your name cast out demons."
[00:51:09.600 --> 00:51:15.600]   They experienced the power of God to cast out demons, and yet he says, "I don't know you."
[00:51:15.600 --> 00:51:21.600]   "In Your name perform many miracles." He even performed miracles and done healing.
[00:51:21.600 --> 00:51:25.600]   And he says, "And then I will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:51:25.600 --> 00:51:29.600]   Depart from Me, you who practice lawlessness.'"
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:31.600]   Lawlessness?
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.600]   The Pharisees kept the law. They memorized the law.
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:44.600]   They were law keepers more than anybody else, and yet he says, "You are practicing lawlessness."
[00:51:44.600 --> 00:51:51.600]   Prophesying, evangelizing, praying, giving, casting out demons, performing miracles,
[00:51:51.600 --> 00:51:53.600]   and you are a man of lawlessness.
[00:51:53.600 --> 00:51:55.600]   What is he referring to?
[00:51:55.600 --> 00:51:58.600]   What is the righteousness that he is demanding?
[00:51:58.600 --> 00:52:04.600]   That these people who in every way on the surface is practicing better than us.
[00:52:04.600 --> 00:52:10.600]   Well, you know this passage, 1 Corinthians 13, 1-3, we quote this, we have it hanging on the wall,
[00:52:10.600 --> 00:52:13.600]   but I want you to really examine what it says.
[00:52:13.600 --> 00:52:18.600]   "If I speak with tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love,
[00:52:18.600 --> 00:52:22.600]   I become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
[00:52:22.600 --> 00:52:24.600]   Now think how crazy that is.
[00:52:24.600 --> 00:52:33.600]   There is a denomination, the apostolic Pentecostals believe that tongues is a sign of your salvation.
[00:52:33.600 --> 00:52:36.600]   I mean, right there, it's a direct contradiction.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:41.600]   He said, "Even if I speak with tongues of men and of angels, but do not have love,
[00:52:41.600 --> 00:52:44.600]   I become a noisy gong or a clanging cymbal."
[00:52:44.600 --> 00:52:47.600]   It means nothing. That is not the true evidence of your salvation.
[00:52:47.600 --> 00:52:53.600]   He said, "If I have the gift of prophecy and know all mysteries and know all knowledge."
[00:52:53.600 --> 00:53:01.600]   Even if you have a PhD, even if you know the intricate details of every systematic theology that we study,
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:07.600]   and you not just know a lot, but you know all, he says, even if you have all knowledge.
[00:53:07.600 --> 00:53:11.600]   "And if I have all faith." Wow, this is crazy. Faith.
[00:53:11.600 --> 00:53:15.600]   Aren't we saved by faith? Aren't we saved by faith and faith alone?
[00:53:15.600 --> 00:53:23.600]   And he just says, "If I have all faith so that to remove mountains, but do not have love, I am nothing."
[00:53:23.600 --> 00:53:27.600]   Think about the shock of what he's saying here, right?
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:31.600]   Think about the shock of what he's saying. Everything that you have.
[00:53:31.600 --> 00:53:37.600]   Coming to church, becoming a member, going to seminary, reading a lot of books, performing a lot of stuff,
[00:53:37.600 --> 00:53:41.600]   planting a bunch of churches, and he goes even further than that.
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.600]   "And if I give all my possessions to feed the poor, if I surrender my body to be burned."
[00:53:47.600 --> 00:53:55.600]   He's talking about a martyr. He's gone so far as to give his life for the purpose of God.
[00:53:55.600 --> 00:54:01.600]   And then he says, "But do not have love, it prompts me nothing."
[00:54:01.600 --> 00:54:05.600]   Do you understand how radical this is?
[00:54:05.600 --> 00:54:13.600]   The central, primary thing that God desires of us more than anything else is to practice his love.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:17.600]   He's not saying that none of these things are important.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:20.600]   He's not saying all of this is trash. That's not what he's saying.
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:26.600]   He's saying, "If you have all of this and yet have no love, you missed the whole point."
[00:54:26.600 --> 00:54:29.600]   You missed the whole point.
[00:54:29.600 --> 00:54:35.600]   Wow. I mean, how can we possibly miss this, and yet we do.
[00:54:35.600 --> 00:54:39.600]   We come to church and we have check-off marks and everything that we've done,
[00:54:39.600 --> 00:54:46.600]   and we feel completely satisfied that we are righteous, and yet he says, "You missed the whole point."
[00:54:46.600 --> 00:54:52.600]   Thirdly, it is our identity mark of following Christ. This is how the world distinguishes us from the rest of the world.
[00:54:52.600 --> 00:54:58.600]   In Luke 6, 35-36, "Love your enemies, do good, lend, expecting nothing in return, and in your reward will be great.
[00:54:58.600 --> 00:55:01.600]   You will be sons of the Most High."
[00:55:01.600 --> 00:55:04.600]   He's not saying that you're going to have to earn your way to be sons of the Most High.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:07.600]   He says this is your identifying mark.
[00:55:07.600 --> 00:55:11.600]   You being gracious to those who are difficult to be gracious to.
[00:55:11.600 --> 00:55:15.600]   People who are actually trying to harm you.
[00:55:15.600 --> 00:55:19.600]   And you are good to them, you bless them, you pray for them.
[00:55:19.600 --> 00:55:24.600]   "For he himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men."
[00:55:24.600 --> 00:55:30.600]   If you've ever tried to be kind to ungrateful people, you know how difficult it is.
[00:55:30.600 --> 00:55:34.600]   Every single parent knows what that feels like.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:37.600]   Every single parent knows what that feels like.
[00:55:37.600 --> 00:55:41.600]   How many times have you been taking care of them all day, and at the end of the day,
[00:55:41.600 --> 00:55:46.600]   you're like, "Oh, I didn't get it. He got the bigger popsicle than I did."
[00:55:46.600 --> 00:55:52.600]   This is so unfair, after everything you've done.
[00:55:52.600 --> 00:55:54.600]   You know how that feels.
[00:55:54.600 --> 00:56:02.600]   So imagine at that moment that you say, "Okay, I'm going to treat you the way you deserve."
[00:56:02.600 --> 00:56:09.600]   Your children will be dead.
[00:56:09.600 --> 00:56:16.600]   You have to practice grace and restraint and mercy, or you can't be a good parent.
[00:56:16.600 --> 00:56:18.600]   But they're not even evil.
[00:56:18.600 --> 00:56:23.600]   It's hard to be gracious when they're ungrateful, but he says, "To evil men."
[00:56:23.600 --> 00:56:25.600]   God was gracious to evil men.
[00:56:25.600 --> 00:56:29.600]   "Be merciful, just as your Father is merciful."
[00:56:29.600 --> 00:56:36.600]   We are to reflect who God is.
[00:56:36.600 --> 00:56:39.600]   God created us to be image-bearers of Christ.
[00:56:39.600 --> 00:56:44.600]   In other words, he made us so that we are mirrors.
[00:56:44.600 --> 00:56:48.600]   Before the fall, God reflected his image on us.
[00:56:48.600 --> 00:56:53.600]   When people looked at mankind, they reflected God.
[00:56:53.600 --> 00:56:56.600]   We were created to be image-bearers of God.
[00:56:56.600 --> 00:57:01.600]   That's why in Romans 3, it says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:57:01.600 --> 00:57:06.600]   God's glory that was supposed to shine off of us was no longer shining because of what?
[00:57:06.600 --> 00:57:10.600]   Sin has tainted that mirror.
[00:57:10.600 --> 00:57:13.600]   So God's glory is no longer shining off of us.
[00:57:13.600 --> 00:57:17.600]   The purpose of the mirror is to give a reflection.
[00:57:17.600 --> 00:57:20.600]   A good mirror is not the design.
[00:57:20.600 --> 00:57:24.600]   Now you put pretty pictures of flowers on there, so that's an awesome mirror.
[00:57:24.600 --> 00:57:28.600]   But if you stand in front of it, your face is all blurred and warped.
[00:57:28.600 --> 00:57:30.600]   That's not a good mirror.
[00:57:30.600 --> 00:57:35.600]   A good mirror is the one that reflects perfectly the person standing in front of it.
[00:57:35.600 --> 00:57:37.600]   That's the way God created us.
[00:57:37.600 --> 00:57:40.600]   So because our image has been tainted because of our sin,
[00:57:40.600 --> 00:57:45.600]   Christ comes and he washes us and cleanses us and makes us new.
[00:57:45.600 --> 00:57:50.600]   Now we have been restored to be image-bearers of God again.
[00:57:50.600 --> 00:57:55.600]   What is the image of God that he calls us to reflect?
[00:57:55.600 --> 00:58:00.600]   More than anything else is this love,
[00:58:00.600 --> 00:58:05.600]   and love in particular of those who don't deserve it.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:07.600]   Because that's what he reflected.
[00:58:07.600 --> 00:58:09.600]   He wanted us to have that nature in us.
[00:58:09.600 --> 00:58:14.600]   1 Peter 2.21, "For you have been called for his purpose, since Christ also suffered for you,
[00:58:14.600 --> 00:58:18.600]   leaving you an example for you to follow in his steps."
[00:58:18.600 --> 00:58:23.600]   You know in the early church first century, you know what they used to call us in the Bible?
[00:58:23.600 --> 00:58:26.600]   The Way. That was how we were addressed.
[00:58:26.600 --> 00:58:31.600]   The Way. We're part of the Way because in the early church it's like Christ is the Way.
[00:58:31.600 --> 00:58:32.600]   He's the Way.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:35.600]   And so they called each other The Way.
[00:58:35.600 --> 00:58:41.600]   Today we say Christian, but the term Christian was given to us in a derogatory way.
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:45.600]   And basically what that means is Little Christ.
[00:58:45.600 --> 00:58:51.600]   So as the gospel began to spread and more and more people began to find out about what Christianity was about,
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:54.600]   they said, "Man, these guys are obsessed with Christ.
[00:58:54.600 --> 00:58:57.600]   They're going to worship Christ. They're going to eat his blood,
[00:58:57.600 --> 00:59:00.600]   eat his flesh, drink his blood of communion.
[00:59:00.600 --> 00:59:05.600]   He's the creator. He's the sustainer. All things are made by him and for him.
[00:59:05.600 --> 00:59:09.600]   That we are to fix our eyes upon Christ, the author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:59:09.600 --> 00:59:12.600]   I mean, these guys, he's the chief cornerstone, rejected.
[00:59:12.600 --> 00:59:16.600]   Everything they talk about are justified by faith.
[00:59:16.600 --> 00:59:19.600]   We walk in Christ and then we hope in Christ.
[00:59:19.600 --> 00:59:22.600]   So they said, "Man, these guys are Little Christ."
[00:59:22.600 --> 00:59:27.600]   So to this day we use that term, Little Christ.
[00:59:27.600 --> 00:59:30.600]   And that's exactly what God calls us to be.
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:35.600]   Little Christ. To be a reflection of Christ in all that we do.
[00:59:35.600 --> 00:59:40.600]   You know, when we think about spiritual maturity,
[00:59:40.600 --> 00:59:47.600]   we think about Bible study, theology, you know, like know-how, training.
[00:59:47.600 --> 00:59:52.600]   No, a spiritual mature person is the person who reflects the Christ we see in the Bible.
[00:59:52.600 --> 00:59:55.600]   That's a spiritual mature person.
[00:59:55.600 --> 01:00:01.600]   And so you can have all that stuff and you do not have love, you're not reflecting Christ.
[01:00:01.600 --> 01:00:06.600]   You can have all the knowledge of the Bible and yet you don't practice the love of Christ,
[01:00:06.600 --> 01:00:11.600]   you're not reflecting Christ.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.600]   Long time ago, back in the 70s, there was a book called "In His Steps."
[01:00:14.600 --> 01:00:17.600]   Some of you guys may know that book.
[01:00:17.600 --> 01:00:20.600]   So when I went to Biola, that was a mandated book that we all had to read.
[01:00:20.600 --> 01:00:24.600]   And basically it was a Christian fiction.
[01:00:24.600 --> 01:00:27.600]   And the whole premise was about asking the question, "What would Jesus do?"
[01:00:27.600 --> 01:00:30.600]   And that's where we get the bracelet WWJD.
[01:00:30.600 --> 01:00:33.600]   What would Jesus do? Right?
[01:00:33.600 --> 01:00:37.600]   And so I remember reading that book and it was like for our generation,
[01:00:37.600 --> 01:00:43.600]   it made a huge impact because we were called to ask the question in every circumstance,
[01:00:43.600 --> 01:00:45.600]   "What would Jesus do?"
[01:00:45.600 --> 01:00:47.600]   What would Jesus do?
[01:00:47.600 --> 01:00:50.600]   In this particular situation, what would Jesus do?
[01:00:50.600 --> 01:00:53.600]   We talk about all the times, "What is God's will?"
[01:00:53.600 --> 01:00:56.600]   "What is God's will? What is my gift?"
[01:00:56.600 --> 01:00:59.600]   That's not the right question.
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:02.600]   The question is, "What would Jesus do?"
[01:01:02.600 --> 01:01:06.600]   When you enter a fork in the road, what road would He take?
[01:01:06.600 --> 01:01:09.600]   When somebody slanders you, what would Jesus do?
[01:01:09.600 --> 01:01:11.600]   And that's the question that we are to ask.
[01:01:11.600 --> 01:01:16.600]   If we want to know the will of God, that's the central question that we need to ask.
[01:01:16.600 --> 01:01:20.600]   Because we are His ambassadors. We are the image bearers of Christ.
[01:01:20.600 --> 01:01:26.600]   Fourthly, we will be treated the way we treat others.
[01:01:26.600 --> 01:01:30.600]   In Luke 6, 37-38, "Do not judge, and you will not be judged.
[01:01:30.600 --> 01:01:33.600]   Do not condemn, and you will not be condemned.
[01:01:33.600 --> 01:01:35.600]   Pardon, and you will be pardoned.
[01:01:35.600 --> 01:01:37.600]   Give, and it will be given to you.
[01:01:37.600 --> 01:01:40.600]   They will pour into your lap a good measure, pressed down, shaken together,
[01:01:40.600 --> 01:01:46.600]   and running over, for by your standard of measure, it will be measured to you in return."
[01:01:46.600 --> 01:01:53.600]   Thank God that God doesn't treat us according to our sins.
[01:01:53.600 --> 01:01:57.600]   But don't expect that from other people.
[01:01:57.600 --> 01:02:00.600]   Don't demand grace from other people.
[01:02:00.600 --> 01:02:04.600]   Don't come to God and ask for forgiveness if you're not going to forgive.
[01:02:04.600 --> 01:02:10.600]   Luke 6, 12, "Forgive us our debts as we also have forgiven our debtors."
[01:02:10.600 --> 01:02:14.600]   Don't ask God to be generous if you're not planning to be generous.
[01:02:14.600 --> 01:02:19.600]   Don't ask God to be merciful to you if you're not going to practice mercy.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:23.600]   Just as you have done to others, it will be done to you.
[01:02:23.600 --> 01:02:25.600]   And that's the problem.
[01:02:25.600 --> 01:02:31.600]   The problem that you and I are in, which leads us to our fifth and final point,
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:36.600]   is that this is the state of mankind.
[01:02:36.600 --> 01:02:43.600]   Jesus broke into this cycle of sin because every single one of us,
[01:02:43.600 --> 01:02:47.600]   we were born into this fallen, sinful world.
[01:02:47.600 --> 01:02:52.600]   We are born into sin, and we continue to practice this sin.
[01:02:52.600 --> 01:02:58.600]   So what ends up happening is, if I asked you, "In what way have you been sinned against?"
[01:02:58.600 --> 01:03:01.600]   Some of you guys may go all the way back to your childhood and say,
[01:03:01.600 --> 01:03:05.600]   "My uncle did this, my brother did this, my parents did this, and I come from this broken family,
[01:03:05.600 --> 01:03:10.600]   and so as a result of that, this is the way I am."
[01:03:10.600 --> 01:03:16.600]   And just as you have been sinned against, you've also sinned against somebody else.
[01:03:16.600 --> 01:03:19.600]   And somebody will point to you and say, "Because he treated me this way,
[01:03:19.600 --> 01:03:24.600]   because she treated me this way, this is the way that I am."
[01:03:24.600 --> 01:03:29.600]   And so the cycle of sin goes over and over and over again.
[01:03:29.600 --> 01:03:34.600]   Those who have been sinned against will sin against other people also.
[01:03:34.600 --> 01:03:38.600]   Those who have been hurt have a tendency to hurt other people also.
[01:03:38.600 --> 01:03:43.600]   So modern psychology basically identifies that, and all they do is,
[01:03:43.600 --> 01:03:47.600]   "You are the way that you are because your mom did something.
[01:03:47.600 --> 01:03:51.600]   You do what you do, and you're an alcoholic because your dad was an alcoholic.
[01:03:51.600 --> 01:03:53.600]   You're abusive because somebody else was abusive."
[01:03:53.600 --> 01:03:59.600]   And to be honest, that is the cycle of sin that every human being is born into,
[01:03:59.600 --> 01:04:03.600]   until Christ comes into this picture.
[01:04:03.600 --> 01:04:08.600]   Everybody who has been sinned against will sin against somebody else in this cycle.
[01:04:08.600 --> 01:04:14.600]   And the Bible says that we are under the rain of death, not just death, but rain of death.
[01:04:14.600 --> 01:04:18.600]   When something rains, you can't get out of that.
[01:04:18.600 --> 01:04:23.600]   But the only sinless person that has ever walked this earth
[01:04:23.600 --> 01:04:27.600]   chose not to retaliate, but to absorb our sins.
[01:04:27.600 --> 01:04:35.600]   And by absorbing our sins, and in His resurrection, He pushed back to give us a new life.
[01:04:35.600 --> 01:04:39.600]   That's why when somebody gets baptized, it symbolizes their death,
[01:04:39.600 --> 01:04:45.600]   but it doesn't only symbolize his death, it also symbolizes his resurrection in a new life.
[01:04:45.600 --> 01:04:55.600]   So, as Christians, we no longer say, "I am the way I am because of what my dad, my mom, my uncle, my brother, these friends,
[01:04:55.600 --> 01:04:59.600]   because of what they did to me." That's the world.
[01:04:59.600 --> 01:05:03.600]   I do what I do because Christ loved me.
[01:05:03.600 --> 01:05:06.600]   Because Christ loved me.
[01:05:06.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   The love of Christ compels me.
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.600]   Not my past.
[01:05:11.600 --> 01:05:15.600]   Not somebody who sinned against me. Not because I sinned against somebody else.
[01:05:15.600 --> 01:05:21.600]   But that the love of Christ came in to this fallen world that is spiraling out of control.
[01:05:21.600 --> 01:05:28.600]   And the only hope that we have is Christ absorbing our sins upon Himself.
[01:05:28.600 --> 01:05:32.600]   And instead of treating us the way we deserve,
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:38.600]   He treated us, His enemies, with love and kindness.
[01:05:38.600 --> 01:05:48.600]   Now, as adopted children of God, we are to practice this love and reverse this curse.
[01:05:48.600 --> 01:05:53.600]   Instead of paying sin for sin, we pay sin with grace.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:59.600]   In 1 Peter 2, 23-24, "And while being reviled, He did not revile in return.
[01:05:59.600 --> 01:06:04.600]   While suffering, He uttered no threats, but kept entrusting Himself to Him who judges righteously.
[01:06:04.600 --> 01:06:10.600]   He Himself bore our sins in His body on the cross so that we might die to sin and live to righteousness.
[01:06:10.600 --> 01:06:14.600]   For by His wounds, you are healed."
[01:06:14.600 --> 01:06:16.600]   You're healed.
[01:06:16.600 --> 01:06:20.600]   Stop going back and scratching your wounds.
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:23.600]   You're healed.
[01:06:23.600 --> 01:06:27.600]   Stop blaming your past or somebody else who sinned against you.
[01:06:27.600 --> 01:06:30.600]   You are healed by the blood of Christ.
[01:06:30.600 --> 01:06:36.600]   Not just the penalty of sin, but the power of sin that is reigning over all mankind.
[01:06:36.600 --> 01:06:43.600]   He says, "You are delivered. If the Son sets you free, you are free indeed."
[01:06:43.600 --> 01:06:46.600]   Blaming your past is the past.
[01:06:46.600 --> 01:06:51.600]   Now we do what we do because the love of Christ compels us.
[01:06:51.600 --> 01:07:00.600]   He made Him who knew no sin to be sin and on our behalf so that we might become the righteousness of God.
[01:07:00.600 --> 01:07:10.600]   The only person, only person who lived a just life received the greatest injustice.
[01:07:10.600 --> 01:07:15.600]   That you and I would become the righteousness of God.
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:22.600]   When sinners complain before God, it's kind of like somebody who's driving on the freeway 150 miles per hour and he didn't get caught.
[01:07:22.600 --> 01:07:30.600]   And all of a sudden he's getting off the freeway and instead of making a complete stop, he kind of had a rolling stop, made a right turn, and then you get a ticket.
[01:07:30.600 --> 01:07:33.600]   $550 ticket.
[01:07:33.600 --> 01:07:37.600]   I know exactly how much that costs.
[01:07:37.600 --> 01:07:43.600]   And you complain to the cop, it's like, "What? Because I didn't make a complete stop, you're going to give me a rolling stop?"
[01:07:43.600 --> 01:07:48.600]   It's the same ticket as passing the red light if you don't make a complete stop.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:52.600]   Somebody told me this.
[01:07:52.600 --> 01:08:00.600]   He's like, "Dad, because I didn't make a complete stop, you're going to give me a $550 ticket?"
[01:08:00.600 --> 01:08:11.600]   No sinner can ask for justice just because you got away with going 150 miles per hour because you're guilty.
[01:08:11.600 --> 01:08:17.600]   God who knows all things can take out the camera and say, "Are you seriously arguing with me?"
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:24.600]   When a sinner demands justice and you get justice, you don't want it.
[01:08:24.600 --> 01:08:26.600]   You don't want it.
[01:08:26.600 --> 01:08:31.600]   Because we have a tendency to point out certain things that we say, "Oh, that's not fair, that's not fair."
[01:08:31.600 --> 01:08:37.600]   Okay, you want fair? You really want me to be fair? Not really.
[01:08:37.600 --> 01:08:44.600]   But the only person who could have pled for his guiltlessness was Christ.
[01:08:44.600 --> 01:08:51.600]   The only person who never sinned, the only person who never retaliated, the only person who was just.
[01:08:51.600 --> 01:08:55.600]   When sinned against, he absorbed it.
[01:08:55.600 --> 01:09:00.600]   In order to reverse the curse of mankind.
[01:09:00.600 --> 01:09:09.600]   And now, as children of people whose curse has been reversed, he says to us, "Now do likewise."
[01:09:09.600 --> 01:09:13.600]   This is why he tells us to practice this.
[01:09:13.600 --> 01:09:17.600]   This is how the curse of mankind was reversed.
[01:09:17.600 --> 01:09:21.600]   And this is how the curse in our family is going to be reversed.
[01:09:21.600 --> 01:09:24.600]   This is how the curse of relationships is going to be reversed.
[01:09:24.600 --> 01:09:27.600]   By practicing the love that he practiced with us.
[01:09:27.600 --> 01:09:30.600]   I want to show you a video. I want to end with this video.
[01:09:30.600 --> 01:09:34.600]   And I want to set it up as they prep for this.
[01:09:34.600 --> 01:09:39.600]   This was a young man, 18-year-old, named Brant Jean.
[01:09:39.600 --> 01:09:41.600]   I showed this several years ago.
[01:09:41.600 --> 01:09:44.600]   I thought it was appropriate for us to listen to this.
[01:09:44.600 --> 01:09:49.600]   Because this is the younger brother of a man who was shot in his own home.
[01:09:49.600 --> 01:09:53.600]   Because an off-duty cop thought that she was going into her own apartment.
[01:09:53.600 --> 01:09:56.600]   And by accident, she saw a young black man sitting in her living room.
[01:09:56.600 --> 01:09:59.600]   And she took out a gun and just started shooting.
[01:09:59.600 --> 01:10:06.600]   And so this young man was killed in his own living room, watching TV.
[01:10:06.600 --> 01:10:13.600]   So they had a trial and found that it was negligence of this off-duty cop, maybe even prejudice.
[01:10:13.600 --> 01:10:16.600]   And they sentenced her to 10 years in prison.
[01:10:16.600 --> 01:10:22.600]   And at the end of the sentencing, they give a family member an opportunity to basically vent toward the guilty.
[01:10:22.600 --> 01:10:28.600]   Typically in that scene, you will see a father, mother, brother, sister, cousin, uncle will come and say,
[01:10:28.600 --> 01:10:33.600]   "I hope you rot in hell. I hope what you did to my brother, that they did to you in prison."
[01:10:33.600 --> 01:10:35.600]   You would normally hear that.
[01:10:35.600 --> 01:10:45.600]   And you see courtroom scenes breaking out into fistfights because the ones who have been wronged desire justice and vengeance.
[01:10:45.600 --> 01:10:48.600]   That's the setup behind this video.
[01:10:48.600 --> 01:10:52.600]   I want you to listen to this. It's an 18-year-old young man.
[01:10:52.600 --> 01:10:58.600]   I speak for myself. I forgive you.
[01:10:58.600 --> 01:11:07.600]   And I know if you go to God and ask him, he will forgive you.
[01:11:12.600 --> 01:11:19.600]   And I don't think anyone can say it. Again, I'm speaking for myself, not even bad for my family.
[01:11:19.600 --> 01:11:22.600]   But I love you just like anyone else.
[01:11:22.600 --> 01:11:38.600]   I'm not going to say I hope you rot and die just like my brother did, but I personally want the best for you.
[01:11:40.600 --> 01:11:51.600]   And I wasn't going to ever say this in front of my family or anyone, but I don't even want you to go to jail.
[01:11:51.600 --> 01:11:56.600]   I want the best for you.
[01:11:56.600 --> 01:12:03.600]   Because I know that's exactly what both of them would want you to do.
[01:12:03.600 --> 01:12:07.600]   And the best would be give your life to Christ.
[01:12:08.600 --> 01:12:12.600]   I'm not going to say anything else.
[01:12:12.600 --> 01:12:20.600]   I think giving your life to Christ would be the best thing that both of them would want you to do.
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:25.600]   Again, I love you as a person.
[01:12:25.600 --> 01:12:32.600]   And I don't wish anything bad on you.
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:42.600]   I don't know if this is possible, but can I give her a hug, please?
[01:12:42.600 --> 01:12:45.600]   Please?
[01:12:45.600 --> 01:12:50.600]   Yes.
[01:12:50.600 --> 01:12:52.600]   Thank you.
[01:12:52.600 --> 01:12:54.600]   (Crying)
[01:12:54.600 --> 01:12:56.600]   (Crying)
[01:12:56.600 --> 01:12:58.600]   (Crying)
[01:12:58.600 --> 01:13:22.600]   (Crying)
[01:13:23.600 --> 01:13:25.600]   (Crying)
[01:13:25.600 --> 01:13:40.600]   Who else but somebody who has been touched by the love of Christ would even consider to do that?
[01:13:40.600 --> 01:13:43.600]   I'd love to be able to do that.
[01:13:44.600 --> 01:13:53.600]   The love of Christ who overwhelmed all sins that he committed, all sins that he's received.
[01:13:53.600 --> 01:13:58.600]   This is how Jesus reversed the curse in us.
[01:13:58.600 --> 01:14:01.600]   And he's calling us to do the same.
[01:14:01.600 --> 01:14:04.600]   Let's pray.
[01:14:04.600 --> 01:14:11.600]   Father, we thank you for loving us.
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:17.600]   We thank you, Lord God, for forgiving our sins.
[01:14:17.600 --> 01:14:26.600]   Lord, thank you for reminding us of what it is that you've done for us.
[01:14:26.600 --> 01:14:32.600]   That we would continue to fix our eyes upon what Christ has done.
[01:14:32.600 --> 01:14:38.600]   That all that we do be an overflow of what Christ has done for us.
[01:14:39.600 --> 01:14:43.600]   May Christ receive the glory that he deserves.
[01:14:43.600 --> 01:14:48.600]   May the Holy Spirit, Lord God, be welcomed and obeyed.
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:53.600]   May your love overflow in us.
[01:14:53.600 --> 01:14:59.600]   That we would be compelled by that same love that you've given to us.
[01:14:59.600 --> 01:15:02.600]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:15:02.600 --> 01:15:05.600]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:15:05.600 --> 01:15:07.600]   Amen.
[01:15:08.600 --> 01:15:26.600]   [Piano music]
[01:15:27.600 --> 01:15:36.600]   I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[01:15:36.600 --> 01:15:46.600]   The sin that promised joy and light had led me to the grave.
[01:15:47.600 --> 01:15:56.600]   I had no hope that you would all arrive to your will.
[01:15:56.600 --> 01:16:07.600]   And if you had not loved me first, I would refuse you still.
[01:16:07.600 --> 01:16:13.600]   [Piano music]
[01:16:14.600 --> 01:16:25.600]   But as I ran my help out of this indifferent to the cost,
[01:16:25.600 --> 01:16:35.600]   you looked upon my helpless state and led me to the cross.
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:45.600]   And I beheld God's love despite you suffered in my place.
[01:16:45.600 --> 01:16:58.600]   You bore the wrath reserved for me. Now all I know is grace.
[01:16:59.600 --> 01:17:09.600]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:17:09.600 --> 01:17:19.600]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my love.
[01:17:20.600 --> 01:17:29.600]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:17:29.600 --> 01:17:39.600]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my love.
[01:17:40.600 --> 01:17:55.600]   [Piano music]
[01:17:55.600 --> 01:18:06.600]   Now Lord I would bid yours alone and live so all might see
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:16.600]   that the strength to follow your command could never come from me.
[01:18:16.600 --> 01:18:26.600]   Oh Father use my ransom life in any way you would choose
[01:18:27.600 --> 01:18:38.600]   and let my song forever be my only dose in this you.
[01:18:38.600 --> 01:18:49.600]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:18:50.600 --> 01:18:58.600]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my love.
[01:18:58.600 --> 01:19:09.600]   Hallelujah, all I have is Christ.
[01:19:10.600 --> 01:19:20.600]   Hallelujah, Jesus is my love.
[01:19:20.600 --> 01:19:37.600]   [Piano music]
[01:19:38.600 --> 01:19:40.600]   Let's pray.
[01:19:40.600 --> 01:19:49.600]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship and the indwelling of the Holy Spirit
[01:19:49.600 --> 01:19:59.600]   and eternal deep deep love of God will consume us, compel us, control us,
[01:20:00.600 --> 01:20:10.600]   motivate us, revive us and send us that we may be the aroma of Christ wherever you send us this week. Amen.
[01:20:10.600 --> 01:20:15.600]   God sent his Son.
[01:20:15.600 --> 01:20:21.600]   They called him Jesus.
[01:20:21.600 --> 01:20:26.600]   He came to love,
[01:20:27.600 --> 01:20:31.600]   heal and forgive.
[01:20:31.600 --> 01:20:36.600]   He lived and died
[01:20:36.600 --> 01:20:41.600]   to buy my pardon.
[01:20:41.600 --> 01:20:51.600]   An empty grave is there to prove my Savior lived
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:57.600]   because he lived.
[01:20:57.600 --> 01:21:02.600]   I can face tomorrow
[01:21:02.600 --> 01:21:07.600]   because he lived.
[01:21:07.600 --> 01:21:12.600]   All fear is gone
[01:21:12.600 --> 01:21:17.600]   because I know
[01:21:18.600 --> 01:21:22.600]   he holds the future
[01:21:22.600 --> 01:21:27.600]   and life is worth the living
[01:21:27.600 --> 01:21:33.600]   just because he lived.
[01:21:33.600 --> 01:21:37.600]   [Piano music]
[01:21:38.600 --> 01:21:50.600]   [Crowd noise]
[01:21:51.600 --> 01:22:10.600]   [Music]
