[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.200]   Okay, so I'm gonna start with some of the questions that people had
[00:00:06.200 --> 00:00:10.800]   specifically for the sessions that you just shared with us today. So the first
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:14.960]   question is, do you think Mary actually knew that Jesus would go to the cross
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:19.160]   soon because Jesus was preaching about his coming obedience when Mary was at
[00:00:19.160 --> 00:00:27.220]   his feet? That's a great question. I think most scholars believe that she had an
[00:00:27.220 --> 00:00:32.200]   awareness of that that the other disciples didn't have. I mean there's no
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:39.200]   way to prove that really. You know when Jesus said that she did this to prepare
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:46.600]   me for my coming burial, it doesn't sound like she was oblivious to
[00:00:46.600 --> 00:00:51.480]   what she was doing. It sounds like she had some idea of what she was doing and
[00:00:51.480 --> 00:00:56.480]   that she wasn't just mechanistically you know grabbing this alabaster flask and
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.520]   had no idea of what was going on. So again most scholars would say that
[00:01:01.520 --> 00:01:07.240]   because he had said time and time again that he was going to be going to the
[00:01:07.240 --> 00:01:13.560]   cross and his teaching about the cross had been intensifying and she obviously
[00:01:13.560 --> 00:01:18.600]   as his friend had seen the stress that he was undergoing, it seemed most scholars
[00:01:18.600 --> 00:01:22.560]   would agree that she had some idea of what was gonna happen. Didn't really know
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:27.680]   about you know crucifixion, resurrection, the second coming, things like that but
[00:01:27.680 --> 00:01:31.760]   that whatever it was that he was supposed to do she wanted to be there
[00:01:31.760 --> 00:01:37.600]   and encourage him in his obedience. Thank you. Thank you for that. Okay so the
[00:01:37.600 --> 00:01:41.600]   second question is what are some practical ways you fought to be a Mary
[00:01:41.600 --> 00:01:48.000]   rather than a Martha when your kids were young? Yeah that's a good question. You
[00:01:48.000 --> 00:01:55.880]   know I think from the time they were really young even my son now he just
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:03.200]   turned 31 and my middle daughter's 24 and then my youngest is 21 so I had my
[00:02:03.200 --> 00:02:10.440]   son a long time ago and I remember maybe from like the time he was about six
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:15.120]   months on just communicating with him that I was gonna be spending time with
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:19.520]   the Lord and I would you know put him in a safe place whether it was in his
[00:02:19.520 --> 00:02:25.120]   playpen or in his crib. I would try to do it actually when he was awake during the
[00:02:25.120 --> 00:02:28.800]   day at the same time every day so that they would start getting used to that
[00:02:28.800 --> 00:02:34.520]   but I would put him in a safe place and then you know shut my my bedroom door
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:39.000]   partially but not all the way and then I would go in there and spend time with
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:44.560]   God and the kids just kind of got used to that. When my daughters came along I
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:49.720]   remember you know the phone would ring or whatever before we had cell phones
[00:02:49.720 --> 00:02:53.920]   when we used to have landlines and they would answer the phone and I'd hear no
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:03:01.040]   no she won't be out for about an hour she's talking to Jesus right now. Yeah so
[00:03:01.040 --> 00:03:06.280]   they were super familiar with what I would do and just making that a priority
[00:03:06.280 --> 00:03:09.600]   making sure that they were in a safe place but communicating to them that I
[00:03:09.600 --> 00:03:13.800]   was gonna spend time with God and you know there were a couple times that when
[00:03:13.800 --> 00:03:17.880]   my daughters were young for example and they'd start you know fighting with each
[00:03:17.880 --> 00:03:23.080]   other and I'd look at the door and see fingers coming underneath the door you
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.680]   know it was after I finished or whatever they would be disciplined and it was
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:31.120]   like you know you you can't there's a short amount of time that I spend with
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:35.520]   God and I'm with you all the time and and I really need this and you guys need
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:41.880]   me to need this as well you just don't know it yet so they they got used to it.
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:48.560]   Okay all right so on to some more personal questions how did you come to
[00:03:48.560 --> 00:03:57.200]   know the Lord? Oh that's a really long story and I don't want to spend too much
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:05.040]   time on it but let me see if I can do the three-minute version. I okay okay I
[00:04:05.040 --> 00:04:12.200]   I was not raised in a Christian home my parents are really nice great people
[00:04:12.200 --> 00:04:20.360]   very moral people but I was born in 1963 and my parents were very forward
[00:04:20.360 --> 00:04:25.400]   thinking and they picked up on being non-christians and wanting desperately
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:31.720]   to raise their kids right they picked up on the liberal ideology that was out
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:37.080]   there and so they picked up on the parenting philosophies where you let
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:41.400]   your kid do whatever they want to do you don't discipline you know violence
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:45.280]   breeds violence if you spank then they're gonna become violent people and
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:48.960]   you know you just let them do whatever they want if they want to color on the
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:53.840]   walls don't hinder their creativity it's all gonna work together in the end to be
[00:04:53.840 --> 00:04:58.920]   this brilliant package just roll with it and so they did that and it didn't work
[00:04:58.920 --> 00:05:06.520]   out too well by the time I was in my late teens I was what the 1970s would
[00:05:06.520 --> 00:05:21.040]   call a hardcore punk rocker I shaved my head oh yeah I had a mohawk at times
[00:05:21.040 --> 00:05:25.480]   every color of hair leather jacket combat boots lived a lot of my time
[00:05:25.480 --> 00:05:33.280]   behind I don't know liquor stores and cheesy clubs up in Hollywood but yeah
[00:05:33.280 --> 00:05:37.800]   so it didn't work out too well for my poor parents you know and they were
[00:05:37.800 --> 00:05:42.840]   again super nice but they just weren't proactive when it came to discipline
[00:05:42.840 --> 00:05:49.640]   they educated us and they set great examples but there was no consequences
[00:05:49.640 --> 00:05:54.760]   of disobedience and I remember being a young kid and just thinking I rule you
[00:05:54.760 --> 00:05:58.560]   know I mean really looking around at my family and thinking it's all about me
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:02.920]   and I could do whatever I want I can get away with whatever I want and so kind of
[00:06:02.920 --> 00:06:07.120]   like the rebel without a cause it was like you know life is bad and so I'm
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:11.840]   gonna just be super dark and rebellious and got caught up in that entire scene
[00:06:11.840 --> 00:06:15.800]   and everything that goes along with it including the sex and the drugs and all
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:22.800]   that stuff so for some odd reason I think because my parents highly valued
[00:06:22.800 --> 00:06:28.080]   education and I did as well I stayed in college through that time I mean I
[00:06:28.080 --> 00:06:32.160]   stayed in school and got good grades and whatnot so I would be college student by
[00:06:32.160 --> 00:06:36.680]   day and drug addict by night and you know just kind of even rolling into
[00:06:36.680 --> 00:06:40.160]   tests with a hangover but getting through it community college is pretty
[00:06:40.160 --> 00:06:46.920]   flexible right so I made it through all of that but I ended up living with my
[00:06:46.920 --> 00:06:54.280]   boyfriend who's now my husband and he we were having a party one night and
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:59.880]   there was a guy that attended the party who was an attractive guy and I hadn't
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:04.400]   seen him before and we just got into a conversation and was offering him
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:08.360]   alcohol and drugs and whatever and he kept saying thanks but no thanks and I
[00:07:08.360 --> 00:07:13.920]   thought you know what's wrong with this guy and he said I'm a Christian and I
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:25.800]   was like wow that's really sad and we actually my husband and I and the people
[00:07:25.800 --> 00:07:29.120]   that we were involved with at the time we got really involved in these like
[00:07:29.120 --> 00:07:33.520]   hardcore British bands and there were these bands and they would have these
[00:07:33.520 --> 00:07:38.560]   banners and anthems and sayings and there was a little it was like a large
[00:07:38.560 --> 00:07:43.600]   a large scarf that we had that was in our kitchen at the time on the wall and
[00:07:43.600 --> 00:07:50.560]   it said Jesus died for his own sins and not mine yeah yeah so the guy was
[00:07:50.560 --> 00:07:54.280]   sitting in there looking rather nervous
[00:07:54.280 --> 00:08:03.960]   and I was like Christian wow that's too bad you know and and so we started just
[00:08:03.960 --> 00:08:12.240]   discussing things and I think the fact that he was attractive helped but but I
[00:08:12.240 --> 00:08:16.640]   was going to school at the time studying chemistry and thought myself to be quite
[00:08:16.640 --> 00:08:21.880]   brilliant and you know Christians of course were lacking intelligence and so
[00:08:21.880 --> 00:08:26.040]   I just asked him some general questions about you know science and whatever and
[00:08:26.040 --> 00:08:31.360]   he didn't have great answers but they weren't like he wasn't stumped and
[00:08:31.360 --> 00:08:36.440]   confused or whatever and he somehow God allowed him to transition the
[00:08:36.440 --> 00:08:44.320]   conversation to just judgment and death and said you know when you die and you
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:50.600]   die in your sins and it was clear to all that I was a sinner you're going to face
[00:08:50.600 --> 00:08:56.280]   judgment and you'll be separated from God forever in hell and that although I
[00:08:56.280 --> 00:09:02.400]   didn't let let him know that scared me and so we talked for a little bit more
[00:09:02.400 --> 00:09:06.000]   and it turned out that he had come with his friend his friend was one of our
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:10.360]   friends and his friend said I'll go to church with you next week if you come to
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:15.800]   a party with me this week so that's how he ended up there but he gave me his
[00:09:15.800 --> 00:09:19.440]   number and said if you ever do you want to go to church or something give me a
[00:09:19.440 --> 00:09:24.320]   call so I acted like there's no way you're hearing from me but thanks
[00:09:24.320 --> 00:09:31.080]   anyways and I I mean ever since that night I was tormented I kept thinking
[00:09:31.080 --> 00:09:38.040]   about sin and God and hell and judgment and consequences and wrong and right and
[00:09:38.040 --> 00:09:44.560]   just was very vividly aware of the fact that if he what he said was true I was
[00:09:44.560 --> 00:09:50.720]   in real trouble and I I mean I would wake up at night in cold sweats and this
[00:09:50.720 --> 00:09:54.880]   one went on for weeks and finally I dug his phone number out of the shoebox I
[00:09:54.880 --> 00:10:00.000]   stuffed it into my closet and said hey about that offer to go to church and he
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:06.200]   said sure and so I went to it was Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa yeah it was
[00:10:06.200 --> 00:10:12.480]   in 1983 April 12th 1983 and went in there it was a Tuesday night it was like
[00:10:12.480 --> 00:10:16.240]   a college and career night and I remember walking in there thinking this
[00:10:16.240 --> 00:10:24.840]   is a nerd fest I mean these people I just could never be like this and they
[00:10:24.840 --> 00:10:29.240]   were singing little praise and worship songs and I just thought oh oh no oh no
[00:10:29.240 --> 00:10:34.360]   no but I'll sit through this and we'll see what kind of a deal I can make with
[00:10:34.360 --> 00:10:41.120]   God so I sat through it I really don't remember what the pastor said but at the
[00:10:41.120 --> 00:10:45.960]   end they did what they did a lot then they would do the altar calls and they
[00:10:45.960 --> 00:10:48.800]   said you know if anybody's here and wants to get right with Christ and I
[00:10:48.800 --> 00:10:53.840]   thought yeah and so I raised my hand and the guy who brought me looked over and
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:10:58.880]   smiled and I you know then they said if you want to if you raise your hand come
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:01.880]   over to the side of the room so I went to the side of the room and looked at
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:06.120]   them and they all kind of took a step back and looked at me and there were you
[00:11:06.120 --> 00:11:09.160]   know younger people that were there there weren't the pastors or anything
[00:11:09.160 --> 00:11:13.040]   and they I don't know if they really knew what to do with me I said yeah I
[00:11:13.040 --> 00:11:16.560]   want to get right with Jesus I'm living with my boyfriend right now I love
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:23.920]   cocaine I'm doing cocaine on Friday I just and they were kind of like wow one
[00:11:23.920 --> 00:11:31.280]   guy said you have a Bible and I said no I don't he's like you should get one
[00:11:31.280 --> 00:11:37.080]   literally that's what it was and so we know we talked for a little bit but I
[00:11:37.080 --> 00:11:41.480]   prayed with them asked God to forgive me of my sins and they said you know trust
[00:11:41.480 --> 00:11:46.760]   God and so I you know asked God to forgive me of my sins and I really did
[00:11:46.760 --> 00:11:52.440]   feel this God connection for the first time it was just the Holy Spirit was
[00:11:52.440 --> 00:11:57.760]   extremely merciful to I think the disobedience that I was in and whatever
[00:11:57.760 --> 00:12:02.800]   he was doing in my life and you know it wasn't a real biblical gospel that I got
[00:12:02.800 --> 00:12:07.560]   or even what I would call a traditional response but God saved me that night and
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:11.160]   I went back to where I lived and they were partying there or whatever and they
[00:12:11.160 --> 00:12:16.640]   said where were you and I said I was at church and one guy's like oh really what's
[00:12:16.640 --> 00:12:20.080]   wrong and he's like well you know what's gonna happen now and I said no and he
[00:12:20.080 --> 00:12:29.120]   said you can't party anymore and I was like really but I got up the next
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:33.840]   morning and I went to the the Calvary Chapel bookstore and bought a Bible
[00:12:33.840 --> 00:12:36.960]   because they didn't even give me one
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:41.840]   you know now looking back being in ministry it's like wow everything was
[00:12:41.840 --> 00:12:46.800]   done wrong but that's what's so neat is that you know God's Spirit is bigger
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:51.920]   than us and he I got a Bible I got a King James Version I didn't know there
[00:12:51.920 --> 00:12:57.360]   were other versions and I just really started to read it plans fell through
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:13:03.480]   for parties or whatever from that day on I have I walked away from that lifestyle
[00:13:03.480 --> 00:13:09.120]   I mean God really changed me from the inside out and yeah it's been an
[00:13:09.120 --> 00:13:15.200]   interesting road since but it was a definite genuine conversion and my
[00:13:15.200 --> 00:13:23.640]   family and those who know me from then are quite surprised we got another
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:27.760]   question about the session so I'll ask that after I ask this one question
[00:13:27.760 --> 00:13:32.520]   because it's in connection with your story so how did you meet your husband
[00:13:32.520 --> 00:13:43.200]   we met at a party yeah yeah I just thought he was really cool and he had a
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:48.200]   leather jacket and had a the you know the front of the Mercedes-Benz the
[00:13:48.200 --> 00:13:51.960]   Mercedes-Benz emblems he had ripped one off a car and had it hanging off his
[00:13:51.960 --> 00:14:06.000]   jacket oh yeah I was like that's the guy for me despise authority right yeah I've
[00:14:06.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   been raised this way so yeah we met we started dating we got along really good
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:21.680]   we had the same interests and we were living together when I became a
[00:14:21.680 --> 00:14:27.400]   Christian then when I went home that night or whatever talked to the guy with
[00:14:27.400 --> 00:14:31.920]   the party ended up talking to my boyfriend at the time who became my
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:35.740]   husband and let him know that I became a Christian and he was a little
[00:14:35.740 --> 00:14:42.960]   disappointed especially he was raised in a Jewish family and it was kind of
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:46.960]   like okay what does this mean and I said I don't know yet I'll figure it out
[00:14:46.960 --> 00:14:56.080]   I'll let you know so the story gets very interesting but I started to realize
[00:14:56.080 --> 00:15:00.920]   right away without even you know reading anything that the relationship had to
[00:15:00.920 --> 00:15:05.960]   change that you know I just knew it's weird how God puts this law on your
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:09.680]   heart and even not being raised in a Christian home reading from a King James
[00:15:09.680 --> 00:15:15.640]   Version you know just starting with you know the the Gospels or whatever I knew
[00:15:15.640 --> 00:15:20.360]   that God did not want us to have sex before marriage and I let my husband at
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.280]   my boyfriend at the time know that and it was like what was he gonna do force
[00:15:24.280 --> 00:15:31.440]   me yeah so it was like okay and he had his own separate journey but three weeks
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:35.080]   later he came through the door and we had other roommates at the time too but
[00:15:35.080 --> 00:15:40.240]   he came through the door and he said I'm a Christian and the roommates were like
[00:15:40.240 --> 00:15:54.240]   oh my we're moving out but we we ended up actually getting bad counsel we got
[00:15:54.240 --> 00:15:59.280]   met I became a Christian in April and we got married in August what happened was
[00:15:59.280 --> 00:16:04.480]   we were kind of attending Calvary Chapel and then you know it was kind of like
[00:16:04.480 --> 00:16:08.400]   well we've been living together and stuff and we want to continue our
[00:16:08.400 --> 00:16:13.600]   physical relationship so we need to get married like yesterday and so we went to
[00:16:13.600 --> 00:16:16.920]   Calvary Chapel for premarital counseling they discovered in the first session
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.360]   that we were living together and they said well this we got a backpedal a lot
[00:16:21.360 --> 00:16:26.000]   here I mean we want you guys to move out separately first and let's you know work
[00:16:26.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   on this and we were like oh man you know that's gonna cost a lot of money and
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:36.400]   that's a lot of work so we were at the same time going to another church that
[00:16:36.400 --> 00:16:42.840]   was somewhat local and they were extremely charismatic and they just you
[00:16:42.840 --> 00:16:46.800]   know I mean they didn't refer to Scripture as much it was kind of more
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:52.400]   like God showing us and the the guy who we were being discipled by and he was a
[00:16:52.400 --> 00:16:56.680]   nice guy but just didn't have a lot of information or didn't understand things
[00:16:56.680 --> 00:17:00.720]   the same way he said well that poor Calvary Chapel that's why you know they
[00:17:00.720 --> 00:17:06.400]   don't have the spirit he said they don't understand that if you guys can't go
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:10.160]   from right now the situation that you're into being married then no one can be
[00:17:10.160 --> 00:17:14.680]   saved and I was like really why is that and he said because God's in the
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:18.320]   business of making wrong right and you guys are living together and you're
[00:17:18.320 --> 00:17:25.640]   gonna get married and I was like well duh that poor Calvary Chapel we'll pray for
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:33.400]   them you know yeah and so we did end up getting married very shortly after we
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:38.280]   lived together and got married would not recommend that to anybody and you know I
[00:17:38.280 --> 00:17:43.720]   reaped the consequences of that for years and God is gracious and forgives
[00:17:43.720 --> 00:17:51.120]   us of our sins and takes a wretch like me literally and makes us you know white
[00:17:51.120 --> 00:17:57.920]   as snow and yet we do still suffer the consequences of our disobedience and so
[00:17:57.920 --> 00:18:04.520]   I did and that's okay it's a good thing but that's how I met my husband and we've
[00:18:04.520 --> 00:18:08.960]   been married yeah we've been married for almost 33 years now so yeah it's been
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:16.480]   it's been a lot of fun yeah okay so I've got a question it's a little long okay
[00:18:16.480 --> 00:18:22.720]   so bear with me it says I'll be honest Mary sounds a little kooky okay don't
[00:18:22.720 --> 00:18:26.520]   get me wrong I really admire her greatly and wish I could be like her but she
[00:18:26.520 --> 00:18:31.520]   sounds special as a more average achiever is it that I need to strive to
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.040]   be like her or are there other principles I need to draw from this and
[00:18:35.040 --> 00:18:39.400]   if so how can I assess that I'm pushing myself to be countercultural today for
[00:18:39.400 --> 00:18:50.960]   Christ in the same way that Mary had done okay so I think you know we're not
[00:18:50.960 --> 00:18:56.280]   going to be at a party where our sister's preparing food and we're gonna
[00:18:56.280 --> 00:19:02.560]   be sitting there at the feet of Jesus right you know we're not gonna have a
[00:19:02.560 --> 00:19:07.840]   dead brother in a tomb with a rock in front of it you know with the Jewish
[00:19:07.840 --> 00:19:13.480]   community mourning around us and Jesus coming saying you know Lazarus arise and
[00:19:13.480 --> 00:19:18.000]   we're not gonna be you know taking our life savings or whatever it is and
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.760]   pouring it on his feet and anointing him but I think the principles still remain
[00:19:22.760 --> 00:19:26.480]   and I think that we can see the principles throughout the New
[00:19:26.480 --> 00:19:32.400]   Testament even you know reading from the Gospels at the end where Jesus said you
[00:19:32.400 --> 00:19:37.480]   know whoever seeks to save his life will lose it but whoever loses his life for
[00:19:37.480 --> 00:19:43.840]   my sake will find it and we see Mary doing that we see her growth process and
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:50.440]   it's just a great example for us because the testimony that Jesus gave to her in
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:56.400]   the end that she had done that beautiful thing and that what she had done would
[00:19:56.400 --> 00:20:01.320]   be spoken of throughout generations and I think that all of us even if we would
[00:20:01.320 --> 00:20:06.320]   consider ourselves to be average or mediocre or normative we want to leave a
[00:20:06.320 --> 00:20:11.280]   legacy like that where you know those who follow after us whether it be our
[00:20:11.280 --> 00:20:15.480]   kids our grandkids our friends you know our co-workers our church community
[00:20:15.480 --> 00:20:20.560]   would say you know she was exceptional in living for Christ she made the better
[00:20:20.560 --> 00:20:25.480]   decisions she made the best decisions and you know she wasn't afraid of what
[00:20:25.480 --> 00:20:31.040]   the world thought or even her peers but her constant devotion love and service
[00:20:31.040 --> 00:20:38.360]   were to Christ so practically speaking I think it's just you know really living
[00:20:38.360 --> 00:20:44.200]   out the basics the things that we all know to be true making that time for
[00:20:44.200 --> 00:20:50.800]   Jesus daily being in our Bibles being in prayer praying without ceasing you know
[00:20:50.800 --> 00:20:55.640]   like the Bible teaches us in first Thessalonians 4 to pray without ceasing
[00:20:55.640 --> 00:20:59.880]   or first Thessalonians 5 it's like praying as if we had a constant cough
[00:20:59.880 --> 00:21:04.080]   that just didn't go away always communicating to God talking to God
[00:21:04.080 --> 00:21:10.680]   about everything you know being obedient to the call of Philippians 2 1 through
[00:21:10.680 --> 00:21:16.000]   8 where it says that all Christians are to have this mind this attitude the
[00:21:16.000 --> 00:21:21.920]   attitude of Christ where we voluntarily give ourselves up for other people I
[00:21:21.920 --> 00:21:27.480]   think that when we live like that and when we do that as the years go by you
[00:21:27.480 --> 00:21:33.000]   know as the decades go by we're going to feel that we had a life well-lived and
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:38.840]   that we had you know we made decisions that were proud of we're made decisions
[00:21:38.840 --> 00:21:43.560]   we made decisions that were consistent with God's law and God's principle and
[00:21:43.560 --> 00:21:49.000]   that means that in the short term we are gonna have days where we say no to us
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   and yes to God there's that verse I think it's in Romans 14 where it says
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:03.160]   put on the Lord Jesus Christ and make no provision for the flesh and I remember
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:08.680]   hearing Elizabeth Elliot speak once and she said you know sometimes it's just
[00:22:08.680 --> 00:22:14.600]   that sometimes it's a put on you put on the Lord Jesus Christ and you make no
[00:22:14.600 --> 00:22:18.800]   provision for the flesh and she said but when you put it on when you choose to do
[00:22:18.800 --> 00:22:24.480]   the right thing God meets you there and he'll get your emotions or feelings or
[00:22:24.480 --> 00:22:29.640]   desires lined up with what you're called to do so I think you know being like
[00:22:29.640 --> 00:22:35.040]   Mary is just being the person who chooses to do things God's way who
[00:22:35.040 --> 00:22:41.560]   saturates herself with God's Word who is humble enough to seek out godly counsel
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:47.240]   and who chooses to do things the way that God instructs us to do things
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:53.360]   rather than the way that her sinful nature or our sinful culture might be
[00:22:53.360 --> 00:23:00.560]   directing us to do does that make sense okay okay I think we have time do you
[00:23:00.560 --> 00:23:06.240]   think grace we have time for a couple more questions oh do you have another
[00:23:06.240 --> 00:23:08.400]   one
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:27.200]   so is that the one oh I think I asked oh yeah just kidding
[00:23:27.200 --> 00:23:38.920]   okay I guess someone is also curious of how your relationship is with your
[00:23:38.920 --> 00:23:44.760]   non-believing parents and how you witnessed to them that's a great
[00:23:44.760 --> 00:23:52.080]   question well my parents it's interesting my parents have three kids
[00:23:52.080 --> 00:23:56.880]   I'm the oldest and the only girl and then there are two boys after me my two
[00:23:56.880 --> 00:24:03.120]   brothers there's about five years between the three of us but my middle
[00:24:03.120 --> 00:24:09.040]   brother is named David and probably about two years after I became a
[00:24:09.040 --> 00:24:13.560]   Christian I'd been witnessing to my parents and to my brothers and my
[00:24:13.560 --> 00:24:19.600]   brother David became a Christian and he's a strong passionate Christian he's
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.200]   got four kids they've gone to Christian colleges they're on fire for the Lord
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:29.360]   his wife's a good friend of mine really sold out for Jesus and then my younger
[00:24:29.360 --> 00:24:36.880]   brother was the nicer of the three of us but he spent a long time just living his
[00:24:36.880 --> 00:24:43.520]   own life and he dated a Muslim girl for a while and when my kids were young and
[00:24:43.520 --> 00:24:48.560]   we were doing homeschooling we would always pray for uncle Mark and we you
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:52.840]   know I would pray that God would break up his relationship with his Muslim
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:58.320]   girlfriend which God in time did but uncle Mark got saved and uncle Mark is
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.600]   totally married to a Christian now totally plugged in with his church
[00:25:02.600 --> 00:25:07.080]   teaching Bible studies at church and so we'll get together for family gatherings
[00:25:07.080 --> 00:25:13.640]   and my parents just say where did we go wrong what in the world have we done
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:23.240]   yeah and my dad actually just got out of surgery yesterday my my mom is I've
[00:25:23.240 --> 00:25:26.720]   always been witnessing to them my brothers told me after they became
[00:25:26.720 --> 00:25:31.040]   Christians that when I returned home and said that I was a Christian my dad said
[00:25:31.040 --> 00:25:35.800]   to everyone don't worry it's just a phase you know so they thought it would
[00:25:35.800 --> 00:25:41.240]   be a phase and it continued on I've bought my dad a hundred different books
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:46.240]   apologetics books he's very smart he's a thinker and they all get returned to me
[00:25:46.240 --> 00:25:50.280]   by my mom a year later you know crisp condition the pages have never been
[00:25:50.280 --> 00:25:58.720]   ruffled but you know my dad is just he just doesn't want to believe he'll he
[00:25:58.720 --> 00:26:03.960]   attends every year he'll tend to Easter service with me they go to like Christmas
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:09.880]   Eve sometimes I'll try to talk to him as much as I can I try to be super gracious
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:15.360]   a couple years ago I said dad just tell me really what you're thinking I mean
[00:26:15.360 --> 00:26:18.240]   what is it that you believe what are you thinking is gonna happen to you after
[00:26:18.240 --> 00:26:22.920]   you die and he said I don't want to talk to you about that and I said why and he
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:26.320]   said because you're gonna disagree I'm like it doesn't matter I'm not gonna say
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:29.240]   anything I just want to hear you and he said you won't do that you always have
[00:26:29.240 --> 00:26:34.960]   to be right and I was convicted by that I said I'm so sorry if I've come off
[00:26:34.960 --> 00:26:41.120]   that way over the years but I do try to engage in thoughtful conversation with
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:47.720]   him a couple weeks ago I don't remember what the event was oh it was Easter my
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:53.480]   parents were over at my house for we had like a barbecue and my brother and I
[00:26:53.480 --> 00:26:57.080]   were there and we were dialoguing with my mom trying to reason back and forth
[00:26:57.080 --> 00:27:02.960]   with her and she she my mom she'll say she gets it but she doesn't actually
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:09.480]   believe that the Bible is the Word of God so she believes in a God and she
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:14.520]   kind of believes in a universalism like all religions are gonna be good and
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:20.280]   everything's gonna lead to God and my dad it just doesn't he just believes
[00:27:20.280 --> 00:27:25.000]   that when you die you turn to dust suck it up and get over with it you know if
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:29.840]   you can't believe that then that's too bad for you but yeah that's just the way
[00:27:29.840 --> 00:27:35.320]   things go so I'm always talking to them inviting them to things trying to get in
[00:27:35.320 --> 00:27:40.120]   conversations with them constantly praying for them I've got myself you
[00:27:40.120 --> 00:27:44.760]   know my brothers praying for them all the grandkids praying for them it just
[00:27:44.760 --> 00:27:52.360]   must be hard being them the Holy Spirit must be just wrestling them down to the
[00:27:52.360 --> 00:28:01.760]   ground so I wouldn't be surprised if God has a plan for their lives okay so our
[00:28:01.760 --> 00:28:06.920]   last question my child recently made a profession of faith how do I not
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:10.920]   discard her knowing only time will tell and encourage her without assuming her
[00:28:10.920 --> 00:28:16.660]   salvation is true that's a great question I I wish I knew how old the
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:21.200]   child was but I will say that Elizabeth Elliot said she became a Christian when
[00:28:21.200 --> 00:28:27.480]   she was five Cory ten boom said she became a Christian when she was five one
[00:28:27.480 --> 00:28:32.560]   of our pastors who was on staff who's now pastoring his own church he said he
[00:28:32.560 --> 00:28:37.200]   became a Christian when he was five my middle daughter who's 24 now and she's
[00:28:37.200 --> 00:28:43.600]   very passionate about the Lord it's fun to be around her because as a 24 year
[00:28:43.600 --> 00:28:48.560]   old it's like she is my sister in Christ I mean she's totally on fire for God and
[00:28:48.560 --> 00:28:54.960]   seeks him continually loves him serves others gives me good counsel she became
[00:28:54.960 --> 00:29:02.000]   a Christian when she was nine yeah when she was nine she took a shower and she
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:10.000]   came out of the shower and she looked awful she just it was as white as a
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:14.320]   sheep and I her name's Hannah I said Hannah what's wrong and she's like I'm a
[00:29:14.320 --> 00:29:22.960]   sinner and I'm gonna go to hell when I die and I was like oh boy she must have
[00:29:22.960 --> 00:29:27.120]   heard something in church or Sunday school kids been on the weekend I said
[00:29:27.120 --> 00:29:31.240]   did someone say something recently in church or kids men or whatever said no I
[00:29:31.240 --> 00:29:36.960]   was just standing that shower and I know I'm a sinner and I'm gonna go to hell
[00:29:36.960 --> 00:29:40.080]   when I die she's like mom you know the Bible she's like find all the hard
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:48.440]   passages yeah so I actually went to Luke 14 25 through 33 that basically says no
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:55.920]   one can be saved it's as hard as you can get and went through that with her and
[00:29:55.920 --> 00:30:02.000]   said are you really ready to give up your life and she said yeah and I said
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:04.640]   what's that gonna look like for you and she said I know what that looks like
[00:30:04.640 --> 00:30:09.040]   it means I don't have any friends anymore yeah and she's good friends that
[00:30:09.040 --> 00:30:12.360]   she was hanging out even though they were homeschool friends they were kind
[00:30:12.360 --> 00:30:16.760]   of like bad girls you know they just weren't nice girls gossipy and rude or
[00:30:16.760 --> 00:30:21.200]   whatever and she so loved her friends that was just her thing to this day she
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:26.120]   loves people but she loved those friends and it was like I have got to let go of
[00:30:26.120 --> 00:30:29.760]   that and be willing to have no friends even if it means you're my friend mom
[00:30:29.760 --> 00:30:35.280]   you know I'm not gonna have any friends yeah and I can remember that was a huge
[00:30:35.280 --> 00:30:38.960]   battle for her and the friends knew that she had this profession of faith and
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:43.160]   they made it very difficult for her they would walk in front of the house in a
[00:30:43.160 --> 00:30:47.200]   little hoard and just stand out there and kind of whatever and it was hard for
[00:30:47.200 --> 00:30:52.920]   her but I what I did was I said okay that's a legitimate conversion and I'm
[00:30:52.920 --> 00:30:57.200]   gonna hold you to a Christian standard and if you get to the point where I look
[00:30:57.200 --> 00:31:02.160]   at your life and say I don't think you're saved I'll let you know and you
[00:31:02.160 --> 00:31:05.600]   know it's not like she hasn't sinned since she has but there's always a
[00:31:05.600 --> 00:31:10.600]   brokenness repentance and ever since that nine-year-old conversion she's
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.440]   lived consistently as a Christian so I do think that that was legitimate for
[00:31:15.440 --> 00:31:21.120]   her and I guess that the long answer to a short question would be if they're
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:25.040]   kids and they say that they've converted then just hold them to a Christian
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.800]   standard you know and just say that's not what Christians do or this is how
[00:31:28.800 --> 00:31:33.200]   Christians behave and if they begin to live in a way that's contradictory to
[00:31:33.200 --> 00:31:38.880]   normative Christianity just say that you know just say I question whether you
[00:31:38.880 --> 00:31:45.920]   really were converted when you said you were yeah all right sounds good okay so
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:49.760]   to close our time together Stephanie we just wanted to ask you what your prayer
[00:31:49.760 --> 00:31:54.560]   requests were currently and if you guys want to take out a pen and paper just to
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:58.280]   write that down if you don't mind sharing no not at all that's that's a
[00:31:58.280 --> 00:32:08.200]   great that's a great request actually if you could specifically be praying for me
[00:32:08.200 --> 00:32:15.960]   right now at our church I'm writing the lessons for next year's Bible study and
[00:32:15.960 --> 00:32:24.720]   I just need help from the Lord it's hard writing Bible study questions it's
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:29.960]   time-consuming and the Bible study from last year that they're just finishing up
[00:32:29.960 --> 00:32:35.800]   now we have two different levels of it like a in-depth level and then a an
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:41.160]   abbreviated version and the in-depth level it's just ridiculous it's just too
[00:32:41.160 --> 00:32:47.440]   many questions so if you could pray that God would help me to engage with this
[00:32:47.440 --> 00:32:53.800]   text right we're going through 2nd Corinthians next year really extract the
[00:32:53.800 --> 00:33:01.360]   authors intent and then write thoughtful questions that are just gonna be useful
[00:33:01.360 --> 00:33:06.440]   for the the women that I get to interface with that would be awesome
[00:33:06.440 --> 00:33:13.680]   I've been working as the director of women's ministry now for 11 years and I
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:20.080]   feel like my prayer request is that God would help me to to do a better job I
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:24.480]   don't want to just settle down and be content with where I'm at but I want to
[00:33:24.480 --> 00:33:29.960]   be better at what I'm doing so that would be amazing if you guys could be
[00:33:29.960 --> 00:33:37.840]   praying that with me I'd like to invite grace up here we have a little gift for
[00:33:37.840 --> 00:33:42.320]   you and yeah so
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:45.480]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:45.480 --> 00:33:54.460]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
