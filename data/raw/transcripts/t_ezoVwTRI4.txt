[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.340]   Awesome. Hi everyone. My name is Adina. I'm the CEO of Divi Homes. It's a pleasure to
[00:00:05.340 --> 00:00:09.480]   meet y'all. Thank you for being here.
[00:00:09.480 --> 00:00:28.040]   All right. So while they're pulling that up, I will just kick it off and get
[00:00:28.040 --> 00:00:34.080]   started because we're about three hours behind at this point. My passions are at
[00:00:34.080 --> 00:00:38.840]   the crossroads of finance, housing, and inequality and trying to solve all of
[00:00:38.840 --> 00:00:42.720]   these. I'll get into what my company does at the very end of the presentation.
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:46.120]   That's not what I really want to focus on, but I want to start off with a little
[00:00:46.120 --> 00:00:52.560]   story that I think explains why this is so important to me. When it was about the
[00:00:52.560 --> 00:00:57.480]   1980s, my mom decided to go on a little road trip with her friends and she was
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:02.320]   in Israel and she was backpacking and she was hitchhiking and a man picked her
[00:01:02.320 --> 00:01:08.400]   up. She got into that car, fell in love, and got pregnant. That man is my dad.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:12.880]   My mom and dad quickly got married, immigrated back to the U.S., and found
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:17.520]   themselves very young, 21 and 24, pregnant, and trying to figure out what they were
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:20.880]   going to do with their life. They couldn't get a mortgage to buy a house
[00:01:20.880 --> 00:01:25.240]   and settle down and be able to raise a family, but they were fortunate enough to
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:29.840]   find a woman who gave them seller financing on their house. This woman
[00:01:29.840 --> 00:01:34.360]   financed the purchase of the house to let my parents pay an installment. In
[00:01:34.360 --> 00:01:38.440]   that house, they had three additional kids. I'm the third of four.
[00:01:38.440 --> 00:01:41.920]   Eventually, we were able to get a mortgage, take cash out of that house,
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:45.640]   and use the cash that they took out to pay for all four kids to go to college.
[00:01:45.640 --> 00:01:51.280]   I tell you this because, to me, this is the heart of the American dream, which
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.160]   is being able to provide a better life for your children than what you actually
[00:01:55.160 --> 00:01:59.720]   have. So much of what we're going to be talking about here is why that
[00:01:59.720 --> 00:02:04.080]   American dream has disappeared for so many Americans, and what we at Dibi are
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:08.840]   doing to try to address that. Let's dive in. I have these bright blue slides.
[00:02:08.840 --> 00:02:11.720]   The goal is to just give you the takeaway so you don't have to figure it
[00:02:11.720 --> 00:02:16.520]   out. I try to stick to one chart per slide to keep it super simple, and I'll
[00:02:16.520 --> 00:02:19.600]   explain it. This is the takeaway that you should get from the next couple
[00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:23.720]   of data points I'm going to give you, which is wealth inequality is rising
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.360]   across America. I think you all know this chart, which is that 99% of wealth is
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:35.640]   owned by the top 50%, and the bottom 50% only own 1% of wealth here in the United
[00:02:35.640 --> 00:02:40.360]   States. So this chart shows distribution of wealth by what your
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:46.800]   household income is. So the top 10% of owners, sorry, the top 10% own 76% of
[00:02:46.800 --> 00:02:51.760]   wealth. The next 40% own 23% of wealth. You sum that up, 99% of wealth is owned
[00:02:51.760 --> 00:02:56.960]   by the top 50%. And what's even more interesting is that the rich are getting
[00:02:56.960 --> 00:03:00.640]   richer while the poor kind of stay at the same level of income. And so what
[00:03:00.640 --> 00:03:05.600]   this chart actually shows is income percentiles. So on the x-axis, the zero is
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:10.280]   if you're at the very bottom end of the income spectrum, 100% you're at the top
[00:03:10.280 --> 00:03:15.320]   end. And then the blue line is how much income or family household wealth you
[00:03:15.320 --> 00:03:21.000]   had in 1963, almost 50 years ago. And the yellow line shows how much wealth you
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:26.520]   have today. So if you were in the top 1%, your household wealth was on average
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:32.960]   $2 million 50 years ago. Today it's about $10 million or a 5x growth. And if you
[00:03:32.960 --> 00:03:36.480]   were in the bottom 50th percentile, you haven't seen your household income
[00:03:36.480 --> 00:03:42.440]   change almost at all. And so you might be asking, "Okay, why is this the case? Is it
[00:03:42.440 --> 00:03:46.480]   that wealthy people are making more in salary?" I would say while there are some
[00:03:46.480 --> 00:03:51.440]   salary differentials, the main driver is asset appreciation, access to assets. And
[00:03:51.440 --> 00:03:54.360]   when I say assets, I'm going to use that pretty liberally. It can mean stocks, it
[00:03:54.360 --> 00:03:58.720]   can mean housing, it can mean small businesses, direct investments. But all of
[00:03:58.720 --> 00:04:02.560]   that I'm going to group together as investments in assets. And so you can see
[00:04:02.560 --> 00:04:07.200]   this is a really simple chart where I took what were the 20-year returns by
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:12.120]   income as well as asset. And you can see that household income has not
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:17.360]   appreciated much in the last 20 years. Whereas the S&P 500, as well as if you
[00:04:17.360 --> 00:04:21.520]   owned equity in your home, you'd see an increase in your value of over a hundred
[00:04:21.520 --> 00:04:26.080]   percent. You want to see something even crazier? You get leverage on your home
[00:04:26.080 --> 00:04:30.120]   equity, which is something that most of you, some of you might get leverage
[00:04:30.120 --> 00:04:33.240]   against your equity, but you mess with the stock market, but most of you aren't.
[00:04:33.240 --> 00:04:38.160]   You can actually lever up your home equity, right? And so you can take out
[00:04:38.160 --> 00:04:43.280]   debt that's cheap because it's backed and guaranteed by the government, 80%
[00:04:43.280 --> 00:04:49.120]   leverage at what has been almost 3% cost of capital. No one else can get that sort
[00:04:49.120 --> 00:04:53.920]   of cost of capital at that sort of leverage. You're forced to amortize, so
[00:04:53.920 --> 00:04:59.080]   you build up savings in the property, and a house has dual utility. You cannot live
[00:04:59.080 --> 00:05:03.200]   in the S&P 500. You can live in a home.
[00:05:03.200 --> 00:05:08.080]   And so if we click on, and so the takeaway has to be those who own assets
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:11.440]   are more likely to have a higher net worth. And so this is a chart that I
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:15.160]   sold from the New York Times, so credit goes to them, but if you look on the left
[00:05:15.160 --> 00:05:19.120]   hand side, the blue bars, all of the bars kind of sum up to 100% going across. So
[00:05:19.120 --> 00:05:23.640]   the blue bars is the percent of families, so bottom 50 percentile of income earners,
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:30.200]   50%, 50 to 80th percentile, 30%, so on. And what this is saying is that the bottom
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:37.280]   50% of families and households own 1% of overall equities in the market. And when
[00:05:37.280 --> 00:05:41.680]   you look at directly held stocks, so stocks in the stock market, they own 0%,
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:48.120]   right? And if you look at the top 1% of income earners, they own 38% of
[00:05:48.120 --> 00:05:51.600]   overall equities, which includes like retirement accounts and everything,
[00:05:51.600 --> 00:05:57.640]   remember I said that big asset class, and they own 51% of all directly held stocks.
[00:05:57.640 --> 00:06:03.800]   So if you ask why are the rich getting richer, it is because they own assets.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:09.240]   Assets compound over time, there's also a ton of tax benefits around owning assets,
[00:06:09.240 --> 00:06:13.280]   long-term capital gains, which I'm sure you all know. Another way to look at this,
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:19.440]   which I think is really interesting, is your net worth by renter versus homeowner.
[00:06:19.440 --> 00:06:26.840]   Homeowners on average have 75 times the net worth of a renter. This is all census
[00:06:26.840 --> 00:06:31.640]   data, it's all publicly available, I'm happy to share it. And I think what is
[00:06:31.640 --> 00:06:36.320]   so interesting here is that I'm not saying the answer is home ownership. You
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:40.280]   want to invest in crypto? Great. You want to put your money into the S&P 500? Even
[00:06:40.280 --> 00:06:45.760]   better. However, the majority of Americans, as you just saw on this slide, don't
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.600]   invest in equities as much, right? It's just hard to conceptualize, whereas a
[00:06:50.600 --> 00:06:54.960]   house is actually pretty easy to conceptualize. And because the debt
[00:06:54.960 --> 00:06:59.640]   amortizes, you're forced to save over time. It's highly illiquid, it's hard to
[00:06:59.640 --> 00:07:02.880]   take your money out of it, it is what makes a great investment. And so when you
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:06.560]   look at why this chart is so high, it's not because homeowners are saving a
[00:07:06.560 --> 00:07:09.960]   tremendous amount more, right? It's they're saving, they're putting money
[00:07:09.960 --> 00:07:14.560]   into the equity of the home, they're being forced to in their payments. So
[00:07:14.560 --> 00:07:19.640]   despite the benefits of home ownership, it is starting to become fundamentally
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:25.600]   inaccessible. So this is a chart, really simple, of average home prices. There's a
[00:07:25.600 --> 00:07:29.240]   bunch of different ways, different sources you can measure home prices, but
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:33.000]   you can see that at the bottom of the recession, which was actually 2012 for
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:38.720]   home prices, the average home price in America was $163,000, and that today
[00:07:38.720 --> 00:07:44.840]   it's closer to $338,000. That's a 200% increase in 10 years. At the same
[00:07:44.840 --> 00:07:49.720]   time, real median income has only increased from about $57,000 to
[00:07:49.720 --> 00:07:55.480]   $67,000. So what has caused prices for homes to increase so dramatically?
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:59.080]   I'm pretty sure that none of this is new news, you all have been seeing
[00:07:59.080 --> 00:08:02.840]   how much home prices have risen for those of you who have bought while
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:06.320]   interest rates were still 3% good on you, because that is
[00:08:06.320 --> 00:08:10.200]   probably the lowest they're going to be in a really, really long time. But here's
[00:08:10.200 --> 00:08:16.480]   the quick history, which is from 2000 to 2008, we were building on average
[00:08:16.480 --> 00:08:23.040]   1.5 million homes a year, and that
[00:08:23.040 --> 00:08:27.920]   equated to roughly four to five months of inventory. Months of inventory mean
[00:08:27.920 --> 00:08:31.320]   that if there were no more homes that were put on the market, how long would it
[00:08:31.320 --> 00:08:34.600]   take to sell all those homes? Four to five months. And that's generally
[00:08:34.600 --> 00:08:40.520]   considered a balanced real estate market. Then what happened? The global financial
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:44.800]   crisis. There was a mass number of foreclosures, the market was completely
[00:08:44.800 --> 00:08:49.440]   flooded, and all of a sudden you could buy an existing home that was going into
[00:08:49.440 --> 00:08:56.120]   foreclosure for $163,000. And so builders who had to pay for labor, for lumber,
[00:08:56.120 --> 00:09:00.680]   to actually build a house, couldn't build a house for that cheap. The
[00:09:00.680 --> 00:09:05.400]   cheapest that a home builder can build a home is roughly $200,000, all in costs.
[00:09:05.400 --> 00:09:08.680]   And so if you can sit there and you're like, "I can only build a house for
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.560]   $200,000, which means I have to sell it for more than $200,000, well, I
[00:09:13.560 --> 00:09:17.360]   can't compete with existing foreclosure inventory." So home builders stopped
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:24.560]   building. They went from building 1.5 million a year down to about 750,000
[00:09:24.560 --> 00:09:29.760]   homes a year after that. And it stayed like that until about 2015. And at that
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.760]   point, a lot of the inventory that came from foreclosures were absorbed and they
[00:09:33.760 --> 00:09:36.960]   started actually rebuilding again. But they didn't rebuild at the same rate
[00:09:36.960 --> 00:09:40.080]   that they had prior. We're rebuilding right now, we're building probably new
[00:09:40.080 --> 00:09:44.600]   inventories, I'd say 1.2 million annually. And so then this
[00:09:44.600 --> 00:09:49.160]   massive thing happened, which is COVID. And all of a sudden everyone went
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:52.640]   from living in their studio apartment to saying, "I need a backyard, I need an extra
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.920]   room for childcare, and I need an office." And there was this mass spike in demand
[00:09:56.920 --> 00:10:01.840]   after years of not building enough inventory. And so what happens when
[00:10:01.840 --> 00:10:05.680]   demand starts to spike and there's not a lot of supply? Well, home prices took off,
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:09.640]   which you can kind of see right over here is that little spiky part at the
[00:10:09.640 --> 00:10:15.920]   very end. And what's amazing is that it's actually just gotten incredibly harder,
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:19.680]   not just because home prices are getting more expensive, but because of the impact
[00:10:19.680 --> 00:10:24.000]   that that has in terms of how much you actually need to save to buy a home. So
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:29.480]   the left-hand chart shows the yellow bar is your average down payment, and you can
[00:10:29.480 --> 00:10:34.080]   see that that's grown roughly 2x. At the same time, median income in the last 20
[00:10:34.080 --> 00:10:39.160]   years hasn't gone up. So on an absolute dollar basis, you now need to save 2x
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:43.280]   the amount that you would have had to save back in 2000. So one, it's down
[00:10:43.280 --> 00:10:48.000]   payment is an issue. The second issue is that post-global financial crisis,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:52.000]   rightly so, the government tightened underwriting requirements. They said, "You
[00:10:52.000 --> 00:10:56.360]   know what? Turns out when you cause a global worldwide recession, we should
[00:10:56.360 --> 00:10:59.760]   maybe change how we're doing things." And so they pulled back and said, "We're gonna
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.400]   make you have a higher FICO in order to be able to purchase a home," which is
[00:11:03.400 --> 00:11:06.360]   probably the right answer, but also pretty painful because people don't wake
[00:11:06.360 --> 00:11:10.680]   up one day and they're like, "I no longer need a home," right? And so if you take a
[00:11:10.680 --> 00:11:14.800]   look at this, the average FICO for homebuyers is well above what the average
[00:11:14.800 --> 00:11:19.460]   FICO is for the general population, and anyone who's under 45 years is even
[00:11:19.460 --> 00:11:23.320]   lower because FICO cures over time. And so what does this all come together and
[00:11:23.320 --> 00:11:29.120]   say is that unless you, you know, have the ability to save 2x the amount, unless you
[00:11:29.120 --> 00:11:32.120]   are above average in terms of FICO when you're starting off your life in a
[00:11:32.120 --> 00:11:36.860]   starter home, you're gonna struggle to actually be able to buy a home. Now this
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:41.720]   chart seems a little confusing, but I think it's really important to look at
[00:11:41.720 --> 00:11:45.640]   and understand, so I'll walk you through it. So what this chart shows is
[00:11:45.640 --> 00:11:52.120]   mortgage rates. 3%, 6%, 9%. We were at 3%, call it a year ago, we're at I think
[00:11:52.120 --> 00:11:57.040]   5.5% right now is roughly where the 30-year fixed is, and then 9%,
[00:11:57.040 --> 00:12:01.080]   who knows, maybe, hopefully not in the future. And that says what is your
[00:12:01.080 --> 00:12:05.600]   mortgage tax and insurance payments, what you have to include for a $400,000
[00:12:05.600 --> 00:12:09.600]   home, which is roughly average home price, and I know a little different in Miami,
[00:12:09.600 --> 00:12:14.040]   but this is kind of across the US. And then I said how much income do you need
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:18.400]   in order to get that mortgage, and you can see that your income that you need
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:23.160]   goes from about $94,000 of household income up to about $160,000
[00:12:23.160 --> 00:12:27.440]   of household income. And then I said how many households could qualify for that,
[00:12:27.440 --> 00:12:31.120]   because there's data on how much income households make across the US.
[00:12:31.120 --> 00:12:36.000]   There are 126 million households in the US, and you can see that historically
[00:12:36.000 --> 00:12:42.200]   almost 40%, sorry, 30% of households actually could afford a mortgage where
[00:12:42.200 --> 00:12:46.680]   we were before, and that number today has gone down to now 22%, and will go down to
[00:12:46.680 --> 00:12:51.640]   about less than 15% of people who can actually get a mortgage on a home.
[00:12:51.640 --> 00:12:55.800]   This is insane. So over here I kind of, I like to just overly simplify things,
[00:12:55.800 --> 00:13:00.000]   so I kind of put it here, which is a $10,000 increase in home prices means
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:05.680]   1 million fewer families can own a home, or a 1% increase in mortgage rates mean
[00:13:05.680 --> 00:13:09.480]   5 million families can actually own a home. So we're in a little bit of a tough
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:15.840]   situation here. So when I started Dibi, the goal was to help solve wealth
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:21.160]   inequality by giving Americans access to assets. This is the sole goal, the purpose,
[00:13:21.160 --> 00:13:27.840]   what I really believe in, which is that access to assets and compounding wealth
[00:13:27.840 --> 00:13:32.040]   in something that you cannot easily pull your money out of and you just leave it
[00:13:32.040 --> 00:13:36.480]   there is the way that we can help people generate wealth for their families, for
[00:13:36.480 --> 00:13:41.760]   their children, for their next generation. So the way Dibi works is very similar to
[00:13:41.760 --> 00:13:46.120]   a mortgage, except it's not a mortgage. You come to our website, you apply, we
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:49.880]   give you a budget. So we might say, "Hey, you're approved for a $500,000 home in
[00:13:49.880 --> 00:13:54.400]   Miami, go out shopping." You shop with your realtor the same way you would with a
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:57.960]   mortgage, and when you're ready to buy a home, you just let us know what home you
[00:13:57.960 --> 00:14:03.480]   choose. We say, "Great, we put out an all-cash, quick-close offer for you, so you
[00:14:03.480 --> 00:14:07.240]   can compete with every other investor offer that's out there. We'll take care
[00:14:07.240 --> 00:14:12.040]   of it for you because we know how to bid on these homes." We then take care of the
[00:14:12.040 --> 00:14:16.000]   inspections, we cover all closing costs, all fees, everything. We head to closing
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:19.840]   and you can make either 1% to 2% down, which is about a tenth of a usual
[00:14:19.840 --> 00:14:24.600]   down payment. Down payments are 10% to 20%, we say 1% to 2%, and that's your
[00:14:24.600 --> 00:14:29.280]   initial equity in the home. You own that, that is yours. And then you move in, you
[00:14:29.280 --> 00:14:33.920]   make one monthly payment, part rent, part equity, the same way a mortgage is
[00:14:33.920 --> 00:14:38.680]   principal and interest, and the equity piece builds up your percent ownership.
[00:14:38.680 --> 00:14:43.480]   We let you build up to 10% over the course of three years. At any point in
[00:14:43.480 --> 00:14:46.880]   time, you can get a mortgage and refinance and take us out, or you can
[00:14:46.880 --> 00:14:50.400]   cash out your equity and walk away, hopefully, with tens of thousands of
[00:14:50.400 --> 00:14:57.120]   dollars saved up. So that is how we work. We operate in 16 metros. Our biggest ones
[00:14:57.120 --> 00:15:01.320]   are Georgia, Texas, and Florida. Florida is a big one, up in Tampa. The average
[00:15:01.320 --> 00:15:06.560]   income of our customers is about a $50,000 to $150,000 household income.
[00:15:06.560 --> 00:15:10.800]   50% of our customers are people of color and 80% of our transactions are
[00:15:10.800 --> 00:15:13.600]   female-led.
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:21.280]   And so I think the most important thing is, are we successful in our mission and
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:26.040]   what we're trying to do? So 51% of DB customers who have come to the end of
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:28.880]   their three-year lease have been able to buy back their home. Probably another
[00:15:28.880 --> 00:15:32.920]   20% on top of it aren't yet ready for mortgage, and so we just let
[00:15:32.920 --> 00:15:37.400]   them build more equity over time. And about 30% of people turnover, which is
[00:15:37.400 --> 00:15:40.960]   completely fine. Sometimes you have an extra kid or two and you need a bigger
[00:15:40.960 --> 00:15:44.320]   home, and that's okay. We actually love that people can cash out their
[00:15:44.320 --> 00:15:50.200]   money and continue moving on. Over here we have what I think is one of the
[00:15:50.200 --> 00:15:53.040]   more powerful things, which is the average renter savings versus the
[00:15:53.040 --> 00:15:56.920]   average savings that a DB customer has in their home. We're almost 25 times the
[00:15:56.920 --> 00:16:01.400]   savings that the average renter has, and this is because they are building up
[00:16:01.400 --> 00:16:07.720]   equity in their property over time. Over here, just to show we're growing quickly
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:11.640]   and we're doing it profitably, I actually think this is super important, is you can
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.680]   sit here and say that you were building a mission-oriented company, you have to
[00:16:14.680 --> 00:16:18.480]   show scale. You have to show growth and you have to show that people, there is
[00:16:18.480 --> 00:16:21.840]   adoption and you're actually having an impact. And so this year alone we'll
[00:16:21.840 --> 00:16:25.640]   deploy over a billion dollars of capital. We measure a margin as the rent that we
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:30.040]   collect, less home cost, less interest. So it's like a true profit all-in margin
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:35.680]   where we're almost probably going to be at about 25% all-in profit margin.
[00:16:35.680 --> 00:16:40.600]   And now I think we have, yeah, thank you.
[00:16:40.600 --> 00:16:44.760]   I think that there is a video, but I don't know if they're showing it. So we
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:50.480]   can maybe go to Q&A if we're running close on time? Okay, cool. Thank you.
[00:16:50.480 --> 00:17:00.400]   I know that Freeberg's gonna talk to you about consumer credit, but let me
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:05.200]   just tee up something before. There's a tweet, I just want to read it to you and
[00:17:05.200 --> 00:17:09.840]   maybe we can use this as a jumping-off point. Blackstone calls homes almost as
[00:17:09.840 --> 00:17:16.040]   unaffordable as the 2007 peak. They just said that today. Yeah. His name is Joe
[00:17:16.040 --> 00:17:20.480]   Zittel, who's a, I guess, a senior partner there. But he believes a crash is
[00:17:20.480 --> 00:17:25.160]   unlikely due to a major difference, which is that most owners aren't using their
[00:17:25.160 --> 00:17:31.360]   homes like an ATM like they did back then. Yeah. Can you just explain sort of
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:36.320]   the broader state of housing actually and why some people feel like we're
[00:17:36.320 --> 00:17:40.960]   actually right at the brink of a crisis again and some people don't?
[00:17:40.960 --> 00:17:45.920]   Okay, yeah, interesting. So the global financial crisis is very different than
[00:17:45.920 --> 00:17:49.400]   this because it was obviously a housing-led crisis where we had people
[00:17:49.400 --> 00:17:53.080]   overextend and they didn't have enough equity that was built up in their house
[00:17:53.080 --> 00:17:57.560]   to cushion a decline in home prices. I'd say that this is a very different
[00:17:57.560 --> 00:18:03.440]   situation today and I'd say that because, one, we don't have a lot of supply. And so
[00:18:03.440 --> 00:18:06.320]   fundamentally when you're thinking about pricing supply and demand dynamics,
[00:18:06.320 --> 00:18:10.560]   number one, we don't have a lot of supply. Now what you can probably argue is there
[00:18:10.560 --> 00:18:15.400]   is an equilibrium point, meaning interest rates are increasing, which is starting
[00:18:15.400 --> 00:18:18.280]   to stifle some demand. Don't get me wrong, we're actually seeing that a bit in the
[00:18:18.280 --> 00:18:22.560]   market. And then there's new home builds that are coming online and at some point
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:26.360]   there's going to be enough inventory coming online that there's going to be
[00:18:26.360 --> 00:18:30.480]   enough supply and a decrease enough in demand that it will impact home prices.
[00:18:30.480 --> 00:18:33.640]   Now I don't know that that's going to be in the next six months. I actually think
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:36.640]   it's going to be more like 12 to 18 months and I don't think that it means
[00:18:36.640 --> 00:18:39.840]   that there's going to be a mass fall-off like it was in the global financial
[00:18:39.840 --> 00:18:44.600]   crisis, but it will slow down the price of which homes are growing up. How much
[00:18:44.600 --> 00:18:51.360]   of this is just the like miscast housing policy that a lot of states and cities
[00:18:51.360 --> 00:18:55.040]   have? I'll give you an example of where I live. I just got an email from
[00:18:55.040 --> 00:18:58.800]   our mayor and basically what it said is like in the state of California now
[00:18:58.800 --> 00:19:02.000]   they've basically said you need to have a certain amount of housing density.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.400]   They're trying to figure out how to do it. They're not going to build high-rises
[00:19:05.400 --> 00:19:08.840]   because those aren't allowed. Then they, you know, you allow these ADUs to get
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:13.760]   built that qualify. And it's all gamesmanship because as far as I can
[00:19:13.760 --> 00:19:18.760]   read it, the nimbyism of not wanting to have high-density homes. And that seems
[00:19:18.760 --> 00:19:23.800]   to be a very just American phenomenon. Well I actually think that it's a little
[00:19:23.800 --> 00:19:28.240]   bit that the markets just react slower. Like this isn't, the houses aren't equity
[00:19:28.240 --> 00:19:31.680]   markets. They don't just, you can't just buy and sell rapidly. It's like oh I want
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:36.120]   to build an entire community of homes. Five years I'm gonna have to now plan in
[00:19:36.120 --> 00:19:39.560]   order to get the government licensing, the regulation, the permits to actually
[00:19:39.560 --> 00:19:44.440]   build. And so you see a problem. You're like oh home prices are increasing and
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.600]   then it's like five years later you can actually do something to actually impact
[00:19:48.600 --> 00:19:52.600]   it. And by then the entire market has like completely changed. And we've
[00:19:52.600 --> 00:19:56.640]   Russian-baited Ukraine and COVID took over and there's a global pandemic. And
[00:19:56.640 --> 00:20:02.440]   so I think the bigger issue is that the housing market can't react as quick to
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:07.280]   keep up with public equity markets. And a lot of that is because the government
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:11.120]   highly regulates the building of homes, which takes a tremendous amount of time.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:15.840]   And especially right now where builders are like, I think that most builders
[00:20:15.840 --> 00:20:18.800]   missed their Q1 numbers how many houses they were actually going to build by
[00:20:18.800 --> 00:20:23.560]   almost 60 percent, which was mostly supply chain. So even when they rush it a
[00:20:23.560 --> 00:20:28.080]   lot of other factors are impacting it. And then what do you think about the,
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:30.960]   because I've talked about this a little bit on the pod because it's something
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:35.360]   that's really I think poorly understood but important in my opinion, where Fannie
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:39.760]   Mae and Freddie changed the upper bounds of mortgage, of mortgages where you know
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:43.320]   you can, they can be conforming now at like a million dollars whereas before
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:46.600]   they'll used to be considered jumbos. And anyways the reason I'm asking this
[00:20:46.600 --> 00:20:50.840]   question is I feel like there's a lot of financialization and engineering here in
[00:20:50.840 --> 00:20:57.320]   the housing market that is poorly understood, that in some ways tricks
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:21:00.960]   consumers to getting in a little bit over their ski tips. And then in a moment
[00:21:00.960 --> 00:21:04.800]   like this where rates rise, their jobs a little bit more insecure, this is when
[00:21:04.800 --> 00:21:08.560]   all of the parade of terribles happen. Yeah so we just added a wonderful woman
[00:21:08.560 --> 00:21:11.760]   her name is Kimberly Johnson's as actually our first independent. She was
[00:21:11.760 --> 00:21:15.280]   the COO of Fannie Mae and I brought her on to like fully understand as much of
[00:21:15.280 --> 00:21:21.160]   this as possible. So the last time the government changed the underwriting
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:24.820]   criteria it led to the global financial crisis. So if you ask them if they're
[00:21:24.820 --> 00:21:28.840]   like really excited to do it another time they're like no no we we learned
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:32.760]   our lesson once. So I'd say that they're actually, because they've been under
[00:21:32.760 --> 00:21:36.840]   conservatorship, so most of Fannie Mae's operations have been very dictated by
[00:21:36.840 --> 00:21:41.120]   the government. They're not actually taking probably the level of risk that
[00:21:41.120 --> 00:21:45.320]   they should in this current market. And what I mean by that is if home prices go
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:50.440]   up by 30 percent, what actually qualifies as a conventional mortgage
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:56.680]   needs to go up by 30 percent. But that is such a massive change for government to
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:22:01.320]   make because they're so shell-shocked I think from having made a change before
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:05.120]   and it having such a negative ripple effect. So when I you know spoke to
[00:22:05.120 --> 00:22:08.720]   Kimberly her response was no no no no we're not here to start making these
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:13.040]   changes to make it easier for consumers to get a home. That's your job. You
[00:22:13.040 --> 00:22:17.960]   disrupt us, you do that. I'm not here to take risk. But you but they felt the
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:22.880]   government just felt like they still like I they felt like that was just a
[00:22:22.880 --> 00:22:27.940]   natural change that had to happen. Raising the amount? The upper bound cap. Yeah I mean of
[00:22:27.940 --> 00:22:31.440]   course everyone is. What's actually even crazier is I'm waiting for them to
[00:22:31.440 --> 00:22:35.440]   actually raise the debt to income ratio. Because of what I showed you earlier
[00:22:35.440 --> 00:22:39.800]   which is if your income is not increasing and mortgage rates are going
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:43.300]   up and home values are going up you now need to spend a larger percentage of
[00:22:43.300 --> 00:22:48.340]   your income on housing. That's it's a massive change. That's a lending change right but isn't
[00:22:48.340 --> 00:22:51.680]   that up to the individual banks they could change? They put overlays on top of
[00:22:51.680 --> 00:22:55.520]   Fannie Mae's requirements but Fannie Mae because they actually put so when the
[00:22:55.520 --> 00:22:59.400]   global financial crisis happened there were such very high fees and penalties
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:02.760]   that went for banks that didn't have really strict overlays that actually had
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:07.120]   a ton of defaults and so now banks are super nervous to lend to people and
[00:23:07.120 --> 00:23:11.040]   actually take risk that they actually follow Fannie Mae's guidelines very
[00:23:11.040 --> 00:23:14.360]   strictly and actually put overlays on top of it. So they actually are more
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.440]   conservative a lot of times than what the underwriting requirements are. And so
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:22.080]   in order for them to actually start to take risk I think Fannie Mae would have
[00:23:22.080 --> 00:23:24.800]   to encourage it and they'd have to do it in such a way that they don't penalize.
[00:23:24.800 --> 00:23:29.360]   Yesterday we had Bill Gurley and Brad Gershner on and if you saw that panel.
[00:23:29.360 --> 00:23:37.880]   Didn't hear about it. So you did see it or not? Okay okay. We looked at all of
[00:23:37.880 --> 00:23:45.640]   assets being inflated from used cars to NFTs and everything in between and
[00:23:45.640 --> 00:23:49.560]   we've now seen compression and we talked about this on the pod in every single
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:55.800]   sector. Yeah. Except housing. Yep. And so we're all sitting here wondering what are
[00:23:55.800 --> 00:24:03.040]   the chances that housing collapses. I was talking to my pal Palmer backstage
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:05.680]   my new bestie.
[00:24:05.680 --> 00:24:10.800]   Interestingly we went backstage and. No no don't ruin it. No we just sat there we
[00:24:10.800 --> 00:24:13.680]   had a great conversation about ten different things it's pretty interesting.
[00:24:13.680 --> 00:24:18.800]   So what are the chances and we're talking about the chances of a collapse
[00:24:18.800 --> 00:24:22.400]   he said maybe it's 30% chance this real estate collapse. We're watching your talk
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:27.200]   30% chance maybe the real estate market collapses. What are the chances in your
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:31.800]   mind being so close to it that we will see housing collapse and this be a
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:36.160]   bubble? Look there's there's no question that housing growth is going to slow
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:41.760]   down. If you look at. Slow down but I'm asking you. You mean price? Pricing.
[00:24:41.760 --> 00:24:45.440]   New homes. Pricing. The growth will slow. Now whether it goes negative or not I
[00:24:45.440 --> 00:24:52.160]   think is more a matter of what the economy does over the next 24 months. But
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:55.120]   I actually think that what we will definitively see which we have seen I'd
[00:24:55.120 --> 00:25:00.000]   say in the last two weeks we've seen a slowdown in the in the rate of growth
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:05.360]   for homes. Now the global financial crisis was very different than than what
[00:25:05.360 --> 00:25:10.000]   we're seeing today and if you anybody bottom of the stock market for the
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:16.160]   global financial crisis 3909. Bottom of housing prices June of 2012. Three years
[00:25:16.160 --> 00:25:22.160]   later. Why? Because the housing market moves so slowly compared to the equities
[00:25:22.160 --> 00:25:25.640]   market and so it is not surprising that housing is going to be the last thing
[00:25:25.640 --> 00:25:29.520]   that's going to actually start to to compress in terms of value. People live
[00:25:29.520 --> 00:25:32.360]   there for a while they can afford their mortgages then their income dropped and
[00:25:32.360 --> 00:25:34.920]   they can't afford their mortgages then they get foreclosed then it's six months
[00:25:34.920 --> 00:25:38.200]   later. So this is long. The stock market dropping you're like I should sell my
[00:25:38.200 --> 00:25:40.920]   home that's gonna take 30 days then I have to find someone oh that's gonna
[00:25:40.920 --> 00:25:44.160]   take another 30 days then I have to wait till they move in that's another 30 days
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:49.160]   and so it's three months before you can like make a trade. You can't log on to your
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:51.920]   Robin Hood account and be like yeah I know the market's sinking let's get rid
[00:25:51.920 --> 00:25:55.960]   of our house. Can I can I shift the conversation for a second. You're a
[00:25:55.960 --> 00:26:03.960]   founder of a unicorn. Yeah. Raised the big round. Congratulations. Thank you.
[00:26:03.960 --> 00:26:08.640]   Timed it right. So well this is what I was just gonna ask you can you talk to
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:14.080]   us about your mindset in this moment now in terms of your valuation in terms of
[00:26:14.080 --> 00:26:18.480]   your cash in terms of your burn in terms of your employees what's what's sort of
[00:26:18.480 --> 00:26:25.160]   front of mind what are you doing same different. Yeah I'd say so we raised a
[00:26:25.160 --> 00:26:31.320]   200 million dollar round from Tiger. It was preempted back about six months ago
[00:26:31.320 --> 00:26:36.360]   or maybe even nine months ago at this point and I think that it's actually
[00:26:36.360 --> 00:26:40.720]   interesting because I listen to you guys on the pod the besties and I think that
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:44.280]   you know for me as a founder when I was going through that moment I was like
[00:26:44.280 --> 00:26:49.480]   well shit man it's a Black Friday sale like I can raise a ton of cash I'm
[00:26:49.480 --> 00:26:55.200]   getting preempted left and right and so I actually think that founders like
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:26:59.120]   obviously I should have played the game that I played which is like why wouldn't
[00:26:59.120 --> 00:27:03.280]   I raise a ton of capital and take less dilution there was nothing that was the
[00:27:03.280 --> 00:27:08.480]   right chess move at that point in time and now kind of to your point and by the
[00:27:08.480 --> 00:27:13.480]   way it's not founders fault that the market got overheated you did the
[00:27:13.480 --> 00:27:20.800]   rational thing. By the way, don't point at me. You did the rational thing.
[00:27:20.800 --> 00:27:26.520]   Completely. But now you have to just know I'd say look Divi we make I
[00:27:26.520 --> 00:27:28.920]   don't know we haven't probably put out there but hundreds of millions of
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:36.920]   dollars in revenue I burn less than I don't know five to ten million a month
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:41.320]   so less than five million a month we have 300 employees and do I think you
[00:27:41.320 --> 00:27:44.840]   have to be conservative yes do I think you had to be conservative along the
[00:27:44.840 --> 00:27:49.560]   entire way of building a company yes every second I thought my company can
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:54.360]   die at any moment right a hundred percent and I run my company like that
[00:27:54.360 --> 00:27:58.180]   my they my employees joke they're like you're the most frugal person ever like
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:03.240]   every single time we're awesome we need to spend I want to invest in the
[00:28:03.240 --> 00:28:08.880]   tiger and thank you yeah do you do you rely on your late stage investors in
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.680]   moments like this to like help you navigate or how do you do it now you
[00:28:11.680 --> 00:28:15.360]   rely on your early stage first of all I don't think you rely on investors ever
[00:28:15.360 --> 00:28:19.600]   no I don't mean that offensively I think that some investors are great but no
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:24.640]   one's building this company with you I am building this company
[00:28:24.640 --> 00:28:30.620]   but ain't nobody else there with me and so when times get tough it is on you to
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:34.460]   make sure you can have a path to cash flow profitability if you can actually
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:38.900]   raise another round of capital but you try to support your employees and work
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:42.700]   together to kind of weather through this but I don't expect any of my investors
[00:28:42.700 --> 00:28:48.300]   to show up with a Hail Mary and I think that it's on me to run a really strong
[00:28:48.300 --> 00:28:53.340]   profitable business and so any changes from June to now or not really just kind
[00:28:53.340 --> 00:28:58.260]   of stay the course get to the cash flow break even like meaning nothing to
[00:28:58.260 --> 00:29:02.660]   accelerate it or so I think we plan out a bunch of different cases so we always
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:10.660]   have the base case target case and then what I call the off-ramp and every week
[00:29:10.660 --> 00:29:15.580]   my CFO COO and I get on a call me just say how's the market doing how do we
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:19.420]   feel do we want to switch from our base to our target case do we want to go down
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.580]   the off ramp path nope this week feels the same the all-in podcast didn't
[00:29:23.580 --> 00:29:31.940]   change our sentiment and we continue on on Monday morning as planned it's great
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:36.660]   to to have you here and I had had you on my podcast earlier and I had told you
[00:29:36.660 --> 00:29:39.300]   like god I thought this was gonna be the most boring podcast and it was one of
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.500]   the best of the year you are
