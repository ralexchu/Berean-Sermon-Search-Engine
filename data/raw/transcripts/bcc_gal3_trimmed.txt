[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.960]   th
[00:00:14.960 --> 00:00:18.540]   -th
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.960]   -th
[00:00:21.960 --> 00:00:45.600]   [ Background Conversations ]
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:46.420]   All right.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:58.820]   [ Background Conversations ]
[00:00:58.820 --> 00:00:59.540]   All right.
[00:00:59.540 --> 00:01:04.620]   If I can ask you guys to join me in a quick word of prayer.
[00:01:04.620 --> 00:01:10.460]   Let me pray for us.
[00:01:14.840 --> 00:01:19.340]   Father, thank you for just allowing us to share in a time
[00:01:19.340 --> 00:01:22.600]   of discussion and observation.
[00:01:22.600 --> 00:01:27.120]   And with a meaty passage like this, it's difficult
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.600]   to know exactly what to target, what to hit, what to go over.
[00:01:32.600 --> 00:01:36.900]   So I pray, Father, for every single one of us
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:41.260]   that you would cause us to leave here just wanting
[00:01:41.260 --> 00:01:42.760]   to study your word more.
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:47.160]   And I pray simply that whatever we talk
[00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.040]   about in the next several moments,
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.160]   it would just whet our appetites.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:59.100]   And I pray, Father, that you would help me just communicate
[00:01:59.100 --> 00:02:02.000]   and articulate clearly.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:06.640]   And so we pray for your help just to be eager learners
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:07.840]   and eager students of the word.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:09.420]   And pray all this in Jesus' name.
[00:02:09.420 --> 00:02:13.360]   Amen. Just by way of review,
[00:02:13.660 --> 00:02:17.240]   this is what we've covered so far.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:21.600]   Okay? Why are we saved?
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:31.120]   Faith, works, beliefs, my family, my religion, my tradition,
[00:02:31.120 --> 00:02:34.820]   my outward obedience, that's not what saves us.
[00:02:34.820 --> 00:02:37.680]   It's 100% by the grace of God.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:41.900]   And that's what we looked at over the last two weeks, right?
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:50.340]   Dr. Martin Lloyd-Jones, he writes, "I am a Christian solely
[00:02:50.340 --> 00:02:54.900]   and entirely because of the grace of God and not
[00:02:54.900 --> 00:02:59.160]   because of anything that I have thought or said or done."
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:02.620]   So his quote is pretty much the graphs here,
[00:03:02.620 --> 00:03:04.460]   just in a verbal form.
[00:03:04.460 --> 00:03:10.040]   Okay? In the next five sessions, in the next almost
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:13.940]   to November 1st, we're looking at just these two chapters.
[00:03:13.940 --> 00:03:18.560]   Okay? The meaty theology is going to be, you're going
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:20.220]   to see it in chapter three and four,
[00:03:20.220 --> 00:03:22.580]   but this is all setting up for it.
[00:03:22.580 --> 00:03:24.060]   And there's going to be a lot of questions
[00:03:24.060 --> 00:03:25.100]   that are in your minds.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:30.380]   Okay? So here's the thesis in verse 11 to 12.
[00:03:30.380 --> 00:03:34.000]   Okay? Paul's main point in all of this is,
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:37.900]   "The gospel is not of man, it is completely of God."
[00:03:38.900 --> 00:03:41.680]   And that's something just to kind of regularly remember
[00:03:41.680 --> 00:03:45.000]   as we're getting into the thick of all of the details.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:47.800]   The main thrust of this is going to be,
[00:03:47.800 --> 00:03:51.880]   "The gospel is not of man, it is completely of God."
[00:03:51.880 --> 00:03:56.400]   And today, we're looking at just God converting Paul
[00:03:56.400 --> 00:03:59.700]   from persecutor of the church to the preacher of the gospel.
[00:03:59.700 --> 00:04:01.020]   So he gives that account.
[00:04:01.020 --> 00:04:03.920]   In two weeks, we're going to be looking
[00:04:03.920 --> 00:04:08.200]   at Paul's first encounters with the apostles of Christ's church.
[00:04:08.520 --> 00:04:12.760]   And then we're going to spend two weeks in verses 1 through 10
[00:04:12.760 --> 00:04:16.760]   where he actually meets with the apostles, okay, and has a summit.
[00:04:16.760 --> 00:04:20.880]   And then 11 to 21, it can be pretty confusing.
[00:04:20.880 --> 00:04:22.120]   You're like, "What is going on here?"
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:26.980]   Right? Paul confronts Cephas to his face
[00:04:26.980 --> 00:04:30.300]   and actually uses the word, "He stood condemned."
[00:04:30.300 --> 00:04:34.900]   That's a pretty strong words to the apostle upon whom the church
[00:04:34.900 --> 00:04:35.500]   has been built.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:39.060]   Right? So this is what we're going to be looking through
[00:04:39.060 --> 00:04:42.940]   over the next five sessions up until November 1st.
[00:04:42.940 --> 00:04:46.200]   And I want to take a look at the thesis first.
[00:04:46.200 --> 00:04:51.320]   Galatians 1, 11 to 12, "For I would have you know, brethren,
[00:04:51.320 --> 00:04:54.360]   that the gospel which was preached by me is not according
[00:04:54.360 --> 00:04:58.280]   to man, for I neither received it from man nor was I taught it,
[00:04:58.280 --> 00:05:01.200]   but I received it through a revelation of Jesus Christ."
[00:05:01.200 --> 00:05:03.540]   And here are going to be some overarching,
[00:05:03.540 --> 00:05:05.860]   uncomfortable questions that we're going
[00:05:05.860 --> 00:05:09.280]   to have a hard time answering that we're going to be wrestling
[00:05:09.280 --> 00:05:11.140]   with over the next two chapters.
[00:05:11.140 --> 00:05:12.560]   Okay? The first one is,
[00:05:12.560 --> 00:05:16.280]   "What makes Paul's direct revelations credible?"
[00:05:16.280 --> 00:05:19.840]   Why isn't like a Joseph Smith's revelation
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:22.860]   that he got directly from God, why is that not credible?
[00:05:22.860 --> 00:05:27.200]   Like, is Paul going rogue here?
[00:05:27.200 --> 00:05:28.280]   Is he Lone Ranger?
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:29.120]   Is that okay?
[00:05:30.400 --> 00:05:33.500]   Okay? And is he acting alone?
[00:05:33.500 --> 00:05:37.920]   Or is he actually going to Jerusalem to confer?
[00:05:37.920 --> 00:05:39.820]   But then what's going on?
[00:05:39.820 --> 00:05:42.400]   So that's a weird, uncomfortable question that's going
[00:05:42.400 --> 00:05:45.040]   to be a little bit challenging to articulate an answer for.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:49.480]   Secondly, "Did Paul really need no confirmation or affirmation
[00:05:49.480 --> 00:05:50.400]   from the other apostles?"
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:52.020]   Paul uses some strong language.
[00:05:52.020 --> 00:05:54.080]   "Those men added nothing."
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:59.000]   Jeez. So he's pretty like brazen.
[00:06:00.160 --> 00:06:04.240]   Okay? And then in verse 11, he starts out by saying,
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:07.520]   "You know, I opposed Cephas to his face.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:08.940]   He stood condemned."
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:11.440]   What is that?
[00:06:11.440 --> 00:06:14.680]   So these are going to be uncomfortable questions
[00:06:14.680 --> 00:06:17.960]   that I probably will not satisfactorily be able
[00:06:17.960 --> 00:06:20.860]   to answer for you, but that's going to be kind of percolating
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.240]   and just bothering you.
[00:06:23.240 --> 00:06:24.520]   So it's okay.
[00:06:24.520 --> 00:06:25.420]   All right?
[00:06:25.420 --> 00:06:28.180]   So when I get to this chapter or this passage,
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:32.960]   the first thing I try to do with this is just memorize it
[00:06:32.960 --> 00:06:36.300]   and just let it just go through my head.
[00:06:36.300 --> 00:06:39.760]   Okay? And then after I memorize it,
[00:06:39.760 --> 00:06:41.520]   I actually will map it out.
[00:06:41.520 --> 00:06:45.120]   Okay? So this is how I mapped out this section.
[00:06:45.120 --> 00:06:49.400]   So anything that was related to the gospel, I had a lot more
[00:06:49.400 --> 00:06:51.620]   in the previous Bible studies, I would do it in blue.
[00:06:51.620 --> 00:06:55.400]   And there's this duality of like the agency of man,
[00:06:55.400 --> 00:06:57.900]   the agency of God, and whatever is touched upon,
[00:06:58.080 --> 00:07:00.660]   whenever Paul touches upon one of those two things,
[00:07:00.660 --> 00:07:02.360]   I just highlighted it in the green.
[00:07:02.360 --> 00:07:06.300]   Okay? Hopefully you guys can kind of see that.
[00:07:06.300 --> 00:07:11.900]   And then anything related to Judaism, circumcision, Israel,
[00:07:11.900 --> 00:07:13.740]   I did this, I tried to do this for the whole,
[00:07:13.740 --> 00:07:15.660]   the all six chapters.
[00:07:15.660 --> 00:07:17.940]   Okay? I would just highlight it in yellow.
[00:07:17.940 --> 00:07:20.780]   Things related to election, salvation,
[00:07:20.780 --> 00:07:22.980]   or calling in the gray.
[00:07:23.520 --> 00:07:30.940]   And then important grammatical words or like trigger words,
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:33.140]   I highlighted that in the red.
[00:07:33.140 --> 00:07:35.440]   So the first part, the for I would have you know,
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:37.560]   that's almost like Paul saying,
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.680]   let me make something very, very clear to you.
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.420]   That's kind of a figure of speech.
[00:07:41.420 --> 00:07:43.160]   So I highlighted that in the red.
[00:07:43.160 --> 00:07:48.760]   And then after this entire like testimony of who Paul was,
[00:07:48.760 --> 00:07:50.980]   he says, but when God.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:52.500]   So that's actually pretty important
[00:07:52.960 --> 00:07:54.740]   because you're seeing a changed man.
[00:07:54.740 --> 00:07:56.180]   Okay?
[00:07:56.180 --> 00:08:03.060]   And then Jesus reveals, or God reveals his son to Paul,
[00:08:03.060 --> 00:08:07.660]   so that, the word so that in the Bible is very important
[00:08:07.660 --> 00:08:11.340]   because that always gives you a reason why something was done.
[00:08:11.340 --> 00:08:13.740]   Would you guys, do you guys understand that?
[00:08:13.740 --> 00:08:15.460]   So, so that is super important.
[00:08:15.460 --> 00:08:18.100]   He didn't just save Paul.
[00:08:18.100 --> 00:08:21.100]   He didn't just reveal Jesus and Paul.
[00:08:21.340 --> 00:08:24.140]   He did it for a specific purpose.
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:29.080]   And then the significant places, I just underlined it,
[00:08:29.080 --> 00:08:31.900]   Jerusalem, Arabia, and Damascus.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:34.100]   And that's how I map it out.
[00:08:34.100 --> 00:08:38.900]   And I brought out to the very front, I received it.
[00:08:38.900 --> 00:08:40.560]   I did not consult.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:42.920]   Okay? Because that's going to be kind
[00:08:42.920 --> 00:08:44.400]   of an important overarching theme.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:45.980]   So that's how I map it out.
[00:08:45.980 --> 00:08:48.180]   This is not like an exact science.
[00:08:48.540 --> 00:08:54.260]   Whatever helps you just flow,
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.000]   follow through the flow of thought, this is an exercise
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:08:59.900]   that I would encourage you to do.
[00:08:59.900 --> 00:09:02.260]   So the first thing I want to talk about today is going
[00:09:02.260 --> 00:09:04.340]   to be the former manner of life in Judaism.
[00:09:04.340 --> 00:09:07.800]   And then I'm going to be looking at the, but when God.
[00:09:07.800 --> 00:09:13.140]   Okay? And so this might be the only time I actually go
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:17.660]   into Paul's former way of life with you guys,
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:20.820]   since this is the first of this section.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:24.500]   So the first thing I actually did was I copied
[00:09:24.500 --> 00:09:31.260]   and pasted Paul's autobiographical little accounts
[00:09:31.260 --> 00:09:31.760]   of himself.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:34.360]   Okay? I mean, you don't need to be able to read it.
[00:09:34.360 --> 00:09:35.200]   I'm just showing it to you.
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.120]   So Philippians 3, 1 Corinthians 15, 1 Timothy 1,
[00:09:39.120 --> 00:09:40.860]   these are the things that Paul said
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:42.260]   about his former way of life.
[00:09:42.260 --> 00:09:45.640]   And then I highlighted things that were not in Galatians.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:51.900]   Okay? And then I went through all of the Acts accounts
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:53.400]   that talked about Paul.
[00:09:53.400 --> 00:09:56.080]   So he talks about himself when it comes to,
[00:09:56.080 --> 00:09:57.600]   he's talking to King Arigarpa.
[00:09:57.600 --> 00:10:00.060]   He's giving little accounts of himself.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.240]   So I copied and pasted those,
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:04.820]   and I just highlighted as much as I could.
[00:10:04.820 --> 00:10:08.620]   Okay? And what I discovered is things,
[00:10:08.620 --> 00:10:10.720]   some of the stuff don't line up.
[00:10:10.720 --> 00:10:13.960]   The timing of certain things don't line up.
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:15.920]   It doesn't mean that's not true.
[00:10:15.920 --> 00:10:17.160]   It doesn't mean it's a contradiction.
[00:10:17.380 --> 00:10:18.500]   It's just hard to synchronize it.
[00:10:18.500 --> 00:10:20.040]   And that's okay.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:23.240]   Okay? And so our temptation is to try
[00:10:23.240 --> 00:10:25.540]   to like piece everything into these little sections,
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:26.600]   but you don't need to do that.
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.500]   There's a lot of questions that cannot be answered.
[00:10:28.500 --> 00:10:29.820]   All right?
[00:10:29.820 --> 00:10:34.460]   So I do this on my notes, and then I'll highlight
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:38.120]   for you certain things that Paul talks about in his former way
[00:10:38.120 --> 00:10:40.320]   of life that were not written in Galatians.
[00:10:40.320 --> 00:10:42.820]   He's circumcised on the eighth day.
[00:10:42.820 --> 00:10:43.700]   He goes by the book.
[00:10:43.700 --> 00:10:46.420]   Okay? He's from the tribe of Benjamin,
[00:10:46.740 --> 00:10:48.560]   which is a very unique thing
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:51.620]   because not all Jews could trace their lineage.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:55.120]   But this man is a pure blood, Hebrew of Hebrews.
[00:10:55.120 --> 00:10:57.360]   Okay? Persecutor of the church.
[00:10:57.360 --> 00:10:59.120]   I mean, that's pretty obvious.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:00.860]   Blameless according to the law.
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:04.920]   And then I also noticed in his later letters
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.380]   in 1 Timothy, he called himself a blasphemer.
[00:11:07.380 --> 00:11:10.520]   But my thought is he probably would not have called himself a
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:13.700]   blasphemer when he was actually persecuting the churches.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:15.640]   Right?
[00:11:15.640 --> 00:11:17.960]   He thought he was in the right.
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:24.420]   He called himself acting in ignorance, acting in unbelief.
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.800]   But when he was actually ravaging the church,
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:29.220]   he would not have said that he was acting in unbelief.
[00:11:29.220 --> 00:11:31.380]   He would not have said he was acting in ignorance.
[00:11:31.380 --> 00:11:33.780]   Right? So I just kind of highlighted
[00:11:33.780 --> 00:11:34.620]   that and read for you.
[00:11:34.620 --> 00:11:38.780]   And then if I look through the book of Acts,
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.920]   there were certain things that I discovered
[00:11:40.920 --> 00:11:42.740]   about Paul that is helpful for me.
[00:11:43.280 --> 00:11:47.120]   Okay? One, he had authority to imprison
[00:11:47.120 --> 00:11:50.140]   and sometimes even oversee execution.
[00:11:50.140 --> 00:11:52.020]   Okay? Whatever that means.
[00:11:52.020 --> 00:11:55.280]   Okay? And that happened a lot.
[00:11:55.280 --> 00:11:58.520]   He ravaged the church.
[00:11:58.520 --> 00:12:01.660]   That's a very strong word, to ravage a church.
[00:12:01.660 --> 00:12:02.760]   But that's what he did.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.320]   He spoke and he understood Hebrew.
[00:12:06.320 --> 00:12:10.900]   Okay? That's significant because it actually gets brought up.
[00:12:10.900 --> 00:12:12.920]   And then he heard a voice in Hebrew.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.140]   And then Paul spoke to the people in the Hebrew dialect.
[00:12:16.140 --> 00:12:16.900]   And they're like, "Oh!"
[00:12:16.900 --> 00:12:19.220]   Right? So he speaks and understands Hebrew.
[00:12:19.220 --> 00:12:23.760]   He is born and raised in Cilicia.
[00:12:23.760 --> 00:12:29.900]   If you look at Galatians next week's passage, later,
[00:12:29.900 --> 00:12:33.300]   "Then I returned to the regions of Syria and Cilicia."
[00:12:33.300 --> 00:12:38.200]   He goes home where he celebrated.
[00:12:38.200 --> 00:12:41.060]   So I go, "Huh, that might be of interest."
[00:12:42.140 --> 00:12:44.880]   He's educated under Gamaliel from the youth up.
[00:12:44.880 --> 00:12:47.400]   He has a zeal for God.
[00:12:47.400 --> 00:12:49.620]   And he's an outstanding Pharisee.
[00:12:49.620 --> 00:12:51.620]   So these are things that you guys have already probably
[00:12:51.620 --> 00:12:54.500]   intuitively gathered in terms of info.
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:56.820]   But it helps to just put it all out on a piece of paper.
[00:12:56.820 --> 00:13:01.280]   Right? "For you have heard of my former manner of life
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.300]   in Judaism, how I used to persecute the church
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:06.420]   of God beyond measure and try to destroy it."
[00:13:06.420 --> 00:13:09.260]   The first thought I had is, would he have called it the
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.840]   church of God when he was persecuting them?
[00:13:12.840 --> 00:13:13.820]   Probably not.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:20.460]   Paul was acting in zeal, in passion to destroy the church.
[00:13:20.460 --> 00:13:21.960]   He was self-righteous.
[00:13:21.960 --> 00:13:27.420]   And he was trying to just obliterate and wipe out this
[00:13:27.420 --> 00:13:31.380]   church for what he thought were noble purposes.
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:34.660]   Okay? And so it makes me just kind of think
[00:13:34.660 --> 00:13:36.580]   of a tangential application question.
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:39.540]   How many times do people who say, "I love God.
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:42.700]   I love Jesus," but they're like attacking the church
[00:13:42.700 --> 00:13:45.580]   nonstop today, one way or the other?
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:50.740]   They're acting in like they believe themselves to be
[00:13:50.740 --> 00:13:53.720]   in the right, but they're persecuting the church
[00:13:53.720 --> 00:13:54.860]   of God perhaps from within.
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:58.720]   Is that something that some of us in this room are doing?
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:00.320]   So those are thoughts that I have.
[00:14:00.320 --> 00:14:06.900]   Okay? So in Paul, in persecuting the church of God,
[00:14:07.800 --> 00:14:11.240]   I just copied and pasted some of the verses that describe it.
[00:14:11.240 --> 00:14:13.840]   Okay? Saul was in hearty agreement,
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:15.740]   putting Stephen to death.
[00:14:15.740 --> 00:14:18.240]   Saul began ravaging the church.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:22.040]   Now Saul's still breathing threats and murder.
[00:14:22.040 --> 00:14:24.660]   And then Paul talks about himself.
[00:14:24.660 --> 00:14:29.000]   "I persecuted this way to the death, binding and putting both
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:30.160]   men and women into prisons.
[00:14:30.160 --> 00:14:32.980]   I punished them often in all the synagogues.
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:38.140]   I tried to force them to blaspheme and being furiously
[00:14:38.140 --> 00:14:39.040]   enraged at them."
[00:14:39.040 --> 00:14:40.400]   That's interesting.
[00:14:40.400 --> 00:14:43.840]   If I were just to say, "I'm enraged at Daniel,"
[00:14:43.840 --> 00:14:45.760]   that's a pretty strong word in and of itself.
[00:14:45.760 --> 00:14:48.440]   If I'm like furiously enraged,
[00:14:48.440 --> 00:14:50.140]   that's like I'm almost insane.
[00:14:50.140 --> 00:14:53.940]   Right? So Paul uses very strong words.
[00:14:53.940 --> 00:14:57.320]   He hated the church.
[00:14:57.880 --> 00:15:03.020]   And later it says, "Being more extremely zealous."
[00:15:03.020 --> 00:15:04.540]   So this guy was a fanatic.
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:06.020]   He was a nut.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:08.640]   He was passionate.
[00:15:08.640 --> 00:15:12.900]   Okay? And he was doing it all wrong.
[00:15:12.900 --> 00:15:16.840]   "But when God."
[00:15:16.840 --> 00:15:21.760]   So that's a very important "but" in the scriptures.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:23.840]   That's a very important time marker.
[00:15:24.980 --> 00:15:28.600]   Okay? "Paul was running a hundred miles an hour this way,
[00:15:28.600 --> 00:15:30.380]   and then God redirected him."
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.920]   Now he's going the other way.
[00:15:31.920 --> 00:15:37.520]   "Who had set me apart, even from my mother's womb."
[00:15:37.520 --> 00:15:41.180]   That kind of is reminiscent of like how Isaiah,
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:45.360]   how Jeremiah were like set apart for a specific purpose,
[00:15:45.360 --> 00:15:46.240]   right? To preach.
[00:15:46.240 --> 00:15:51.020]   But set apart just means to fix as a boundary,
[00:15:51.020 --> 00:15:52.240]   to determine beforehand.
[00:15:52.240 --> 00:15:54.800]   Okay? Are we set apart?
[00:15:55.660 --> 00:15:57.720]   Hopefully you say yes.
[00:15:57.720 --> 00:16:01.880]   Okay? And then here's a word "calling."
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:04.840]   And what is a calling?
[00:16:04.840 --> 00:16:07.300]   It refers to the whole complex of events,
[00:16:07.300 --> 00:16:08.780]   including repentance and faith
[00:16:08.780 --> 00:16:11.520]   by which a lost sinner is converted to Christ.
[00:16:11.520 --> 00:16:17.000]   So he is set apart from the womb, and then he is called
[00:16:17.000 --> 00:16:20.720]   for the purpose of preaching.
[00:16:21.940 --> 00:16:27.580]   Okay? So I have a couple verses here that my mind went to,
[00:16:27.580 --> 00:16:29.000]   Ephesians 1, 4 through 5.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:32.640]   "Just as he chose us in him before the foundation
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:35.200]   of the world," not from even before my mother existed.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:38.620]   Okay? "From before the foundation of the world
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:41.120]   that we would be holy and blameless before him,
[00:16:41.120 --> 00:16:45.160]   in love he predestined us to adoption as sons
[00:16:45.160 --> 00:16:48.400]   through Jesus Christ to himself according to the kind
[00:16:48.400 --> 00:16:49.880]   and intention of his will."
[00:16:50.600 --> 00:16:54.220]   God's election and predestination are hard
[00:16:54.220 --> 00:16:55.780]   to argue against in Scripture.
[00:16:55.780 --> 00:16:59.080]   Okay? Revelation 13, 8.
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:02.040]   "All who dwell on the earth will worship him,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.720]   and everyone whose name has not been written
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:06.820]   from the foundation of the world in the book of life
[00:17:06.820 --> 00:17:07.940]   of the lamb who has been slain."
[00:17:07.940 --> 00:17:12.440]   So the book of the life of the lamb
[00:17:12.440 --> 00:17:14.540]   who has been slain was written from when?
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:18.200]   Before the foundation of the world.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:21.760]   Okay? So God ordained this.
[00:17:21.760 --> 00:17:27.780]   Okay? So if you've been set apart, you've been set apart
[00:17:27.780 --> 00:17:30.760]   from before time began is what the Scripture teaches.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.440]   Amen? Hallelujah.
[00:17:33.440 --> 00:17:36.340]   God, there's nothing that's out of his control.
[00:17:36.340 --> 00:17:40.380]   And what are we set apart for?
[00:17:40.380 --> 00:17:41.840]   Okay? Ephesians 2, 10.
[00:17:41.840 --> 00:17:44.540]   "For we are his workmanship created in Christ Jesus
[00:17:44.540 --> 00:17:47.160]   for good works which God prepared beforehand
[00:17:47.160 --> 00:17:48.760]   so that we would walk in them."
[00:17:48.920 --> 00:17:50.400]   And so here's the application.
[00:17:50.400 --> 00:17:55.300]   Be diligent to make your calling and your election sure.
[00:17:55.300 --> 00:18:00.960]   Right? A lot of the times people get kind of, well,
[00:18:00.960 --> 00:18:03.680]   if God predestined, what if I'm not predestined?
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.740]   Like, that's a very arrogant statement.
[00:18:08.740 --> 00:18:11.640]   Okay? While it is still called today
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:13.380]   and you have an opportunity to repent today
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:15.040]   if you hear your voice, do not harden your heart
[00:18:15.040 --> 00:18:17.740]   as your forefathers did in the wilderness.
[00:18:18.240 --> 00:18:21.760]   So our application really is
[00:18:21.760 --> 00:18:23.420]   to make our calling and election sure.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:27.420]   So I'm going back to Paul.
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:35.840]   So I look through just all the Acts accounts and I see
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:37.720]   that he's converted.
[00:18:37.720 --> 00:18:39.580]   And how is he converted?
[00:18:39.580 --> 00:18:44.460]   Saul sees a light from heaven, brighter than the sun it says
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:45.960]   in some of the accounts.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:47.520]   He hears a voice.
[00:18:47.520 --> 00:18:49.620]   Is Paul the only one who sees the light?
[00:18:49.620 --> 00:18:52.380]   No. There's people with him.
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:55.940]   Okay? But they don't quite discern the voice.
[00:18:55.940 --> 00:19:00.960]   He hears get up and go on into Damascus.
[00:19:00.960 --> 00:19:04.580]   Ananias who's terrified of Paul, God sends him
[00:19:04.580 --> 00:19:07.000]   to minister to Paul, Saul.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:10.680]   And then Paul returns to Jerusalem temple,
[00:19:10.680 --> 00:19:12.160]   falls into a trance.
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:18.400]   And he immediately gets up after he's baptized, he preaches.
[00:19:18.400 --> 00:19:21.840]   And then day one, people are out to get him, to kill him.
[00:19:21.840 --> 00:19:26.120]   Two plots against his life happen right then in Jerusalem.
[00:19:26.120 --> 00:19:29.160]   So when Paul says in Galatians, I did not go to Jerusalem,
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.440]   the question I have is like, but he's in Jerusalem.
[00:19:31.440 --> 00:19:33.840]   Right? Is that a contradiction
[00:19:33.840 --> 00:19:35.260]   or is that just a different time marker?
[00:19:35.260 --> 00:19:38.280]   So that's a question that I'm going to have in my head
[00:19:38.280 --> 00:19:40.220]   over the next several sessions.
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:45.520]   And then do you know who helps Saul get away
[00:19:45.520 --> 00:19:46.860]   from the murderer plots?
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:49.300]   His former disciples.
[00:19:49.300 --> 00:19:52.500]   And it makes me wonder, I wonder what
[00:19:52.500 --> 00:19:53.700]   that conversation would have been like.
[00:19:53.700 --> 00:19:56.420]   Saul's like, I believe in Jesus.
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.180]   And all of his former disciples,
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:02.460]   there was probably a lot of confusion.
[00:20:02.460 --> 00:20:07.520]   But they let him down the basket and then he goes away.
[00:20:07.520 --> 00:20:09.940]   So there's a lot of stuff, if you actually look
[00:20:09.940 --> 00:20:13.820]   through the Acts accounts, that give you additional detail
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:16.140]   that will help you when you're reading Galatians.
[00:20:16.140 --> 00:20:18.900]   So Acts chapter 26, verse 16 to 18.
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:21.700]   But get up and stand on your feet.
[00:20:21.700 --> 00:20:25.880]   For this purpose I have appeared to you
[00:20:25.880 --> 00:20:29.680]   to appoint you a minister and a witness,
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:32.200]   not only to the things which you have seen,
[00:20:32.200 --> 00:20:35.920]   but also to the things in which I will appear to you.
[00:20:35.920 --> 00:20:37.080]   These are the words of Jesus.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:42.500]   Rescuing you from the Jewish people and from the Gentiles
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:46.580]   to whom I am sending you for what purpose?
[00:20:46.580 --> 00:20:49.820]   To open their eyes so that they may turn from darkness
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:53.020]   to light, from the dominion of Satan to God,
[00:20:53.020 --> 00:20:55.600]   that they may receive forgiveness of sins
[00:20:55.600 --> 00:20:59.040]   and an inheritance among those who have been sanctified
[00:20:59.040 --> 00:21:00.720]   by faith in me.
[00:21:00.720 --> 00:21:02.700]   So this is Paul's so that.
[00:21:02.700 --> 00:21:04.980]   Okay?
[00:21:05.560 --> 00:21:08.440]   But when God, who had set me apart from my mother's womb
[00:21:08.440 --> 00:21:09.680]   and called me through his grace,
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:12.500]   was pleased to reveal his son in me,
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:15.600]   like that so that is very important.
[00:21:15.600 --> 00:21:21.820]   So then I would ask you, are you saved?
[00:21:21.820 --> 00:21:27.260]   If you are saved, what are you saved for?
[00:21:27.260 --> 00:21:29.680]   What is your so that?
[00:21:32.740 --> 00:21:36.800]   Biblical illiteracy will produce very weak answers
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:37.640]   to this so that.
[00:21:37.640 --> 00:21:41.220]   I am saved so that I can be in heaven.
[00:21:41.220 --> 00:21:44.340]   I am saved so that I can avoid hell.
[00:21:44.340 --> 00:21:46.760]   I have been saved so that I can have a better life
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:47.600]   here on earth.
[00:21:47.600 --> 00:21:49.760]   I have been saved so that my life
[00:21:49.760 --> 00:21:51.200]   can have purpose and meaning.
[00:21:51.200 --> 00:21:53.520]   Is that a biblical so that?
[00:21:53.520 --> 00:21:59.160]   What have you been set apart and called for?
[00:21:59.640 --> 00:22:02.720]   Is an applicational question that's important
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.820]   for us to think about.
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:06.580]   Okay?
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:09.740]   And one thing that's really cool about Paul,
[00:22:09.740 --> 00:22:11.740]   and this is kind of something to keep on the back burner
[00:22:11.740 --> 00:22:13.400]   when we were looking at Galatians,
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:17.940]   but by the grace of God, I am what I am.
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:21.640]   And his grace toward me did not prove vain.
[00:22:21.640 --> 00:22:27.780]   But I labored even more than all of the other apostles.
[00:22:28.860 --> 00:22:30.900]   Yet not I, but the grace of God with me.
[00:22:30.900 --> 00:22:36.140]   Did Paul work hard?
[00:22:36.140 --> 00:22:39.540]   Absolutely.
[00:22:39.540 --> 00:22:44.480]   Did he work hard to earn righteousness or salvation?
[00:22:44.480 --> 00:22:47.560]   No.
[00:22:47.560 --> 00:22:50.700]   But the grace of God, which set him apart,
[00:22:50.700 --> 00:22:55.700]   called him, saved him, ignited his righteous life.
[00:22:57.480 --> 00:22:59.320]   And that's an important thought to keep in mind
[00:22:59.320 --> 00:23:01.000]   when we're going over Galatians.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:05.760]   And then in that zeal that Paul now has
[00:23:05.760 --> 00:23:07.680]   for Jesus and for the church,
[00:23:07.680 --> 00:23:10.120]   you also see him actually growing in humility.
[00:23:10.120 --> 00:23:11.240]   So something that's really cool,
[00:23:11.240 --> 00:23:13.840]   if you look through Paul's descriptions of himself,
[00:23:13.840 --> 00:23:16.700]   1 Corinthians is a little bit earlier
[00:23:16.700 --> 00:23:18.040]   when he writes in verse eight.
[00:23:18.040 --> 00:23:20.340]   He says, I am the least of all the apostles.
[00:23:20.340 --> 00:23:24.520]   In Ephesians 3, eight, which is one of his prison epistles,
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:25.600]   he actually calls himself,
[00:23:25.600 --> 00:23:27.840]   I am like the least of all the Christians.
[00:23:27.840 --> 00:23:30.160]   I am the least of all the saints.
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:31.400]   And toward the end of his life,
[00:23:31.400 --> 00:23:32.680]   when he's writing to Timothy,
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:35.720]   he actually says, I am the chief of sinners.
[00:23:35.720 --> 00:23:41.080]   So I think as Paul grows in his faith,
[00:23:41.080 --> 00:23:44.180]   he's seeing more and more and more of the depravity
[00:23:44.180 --> 00:23:45.520]   that God saved him out of.
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:49.920]   And I find that very cool.
[00:23:49.920 --> 00:23:54.160]   I'm gonna just do one little last exercise
[00:23:54.160 --> 00:23:55.500]   just for your benefit.
[00:23:55.500 --> 00:23:59.200]   I like maps.
[00:23:59.200 --> 00:24:03.480]   It helps me kind of mentally to track what's going on where.
[00:24:03.480 --> 00:24:07.560]   Verse 15 to 17 is just one long verse, okay?
[00:24:07.560 --> 00:24:09.480]   It's actually just one long sentence,
[00:24:09.480 --> 00:24:13.360]   but there's some geography that's mentioned here.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:16.440]   So Paul says, after he got saved,
[00:24:16.440 --> 00:24:21.580]   he says, so he was in Damascus.
[00:24:22.660 --> 00:24:24.540]   So I didn't go up to Jerusalem,
[00:24:24.540 --> 00:24:26.640]   to those who were apostles before me,
[00:24:26.640 --> 00:24:30.020]   but I went away to Arabia, which is a little bit south,
[00:24:30.020 --> 00:24:34.820]   and then returned once more to Damascus.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:36.060]   Then three years later,
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:39.600]   I went down technically to Jerusalem.
[00:24:39.600 --> 00:24:41.780]   So one thing that I observed is there is no,
[00:24:41.780 --> 00:24:43.380]   I ever go down to Jerusalem.
[00:24:43.380 --> 00:24:45.200]   And I wonder if that's the figure of speech.
[00:24:45.200 --> 00:24:46.380]   Is it always up?
[00:24:46.380 --> 00:24:49.020]   Okay, but anyway, he goes to Jerusalem
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:51.160]   to get acquainted with Peter, Cephas.
[00:24:52.160 --> 00:24:57.160]   And then later he goes to Syria up north,
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:04.040]   and Cilicia, his area of origin and birth and his youth.
[00:25:04.040 --> 00:25:11.000]   Okay, so that's the wrap up for today.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:12.400]   It's pretty meaty.
[00:25:12.400 --> 00:25:13.700]   It's pretty heavy.
[00:25:13.700 --> 00:25:14.700]   And my knees are knocking
[00:25:14.700 --> 00:25:16.560]   as I'm always trying to prepare like the wrap up.
[00:25:16.560 --> 00:25:17.680]   I'm like, what do I talk?
[00:25:17.680 --> 00:25:19.720]   Like, what do I, how do I address this?
[00:25:19.720 --> 00:25:22.920]   But hopefully you can make sense of a lot of the things
[00:25:22.920 --> 00:25:24.680]   that we talk about in the wrap up
[00:25:24.680 --> 00:25:28.240]   as you're plowing through the text yourselves.
[00:25:28.240 --> 00:25:33.340]   All right, I'm gonna just do a couple of announcements,
[00:25:33.340 --> 00:25:34.180]   upcoming events,
[00:25:34.180 --> 00:25:37.440]   and then I'm gonna talk about the discussion questions.
[00:25:37.440 --> 00:25:39.260]   Next week, we don't have Bible study.
[00:25:39.260 --> 00:25:40.840]   Hopefully you guys knew that.
[00:25:40.840 --> 00:25:43.180]   Next Wednesday, we don't have any Bible study.
[00:25:43.180 --> 00:25:44.760]   On Friday at 7.30,
[00:25:44.760 --> 00:25:46.840]   we're gonna have our all church praise and prayer.
[00:25:46.840 --> 00:25:49.040]   This isn't something where like, hey, no Bible study.
[00:25:49.040 --> 00:25:51.240]   I get a week off.
[00:25:51.240 --> 00:25:54.840]   No, this is actually when we wanna make a concentrated effort
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:57.560]   to gather together to really pray
[00:25:57.560 --> 00:25:58.600]   for the needs of the church,
[00:25:58.600 --> 00:26:00.640]   for the needs of our members.
[00:26:00.640 --> 00:26:03.920]   So please do make it a priority to come at 7.30.
[00:26:03.920 --> 00:26:07.400]   For you guys who are interested
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:09.680]   in being members of the church and are not yet,
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:13.360]   our next membership class will start in a couple of weeks.
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.760]   And so if you can,
[00:26:15.760 --> 00:26:18.580]   do sign up for that through this link.
[00:26:18.580 --> 00:26:22.180]   For you guys who are aware
[00:26:22.180 --> 00:26:24.320]   that the Reformation Night is coming up,
[00:26:24.320 --> 00:26:26.800]   it's on Tuesday night, October 31st,
[00:26:26.800 --> 00:26:31.520]   and we actually do need a lot of volunteers to host trunks,
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:34.860]   to donate candy, to donate goods and things like that.
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:37.680]   You do have to be a member, okay?
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:41.820]   So please do volunteer if you are able.
[00:26:41.820 --> 00:26:43.820]   And Sunday, November 19th,
[00:26:43.820 --> 00:26:46.260]   we are having our regional Thanksgiving dinner,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:49.060]   but we are right now,
[00:26:49.060 --> 00:26:50.980]   we only have enough homes for like
[00:26:50.980 --> 00:26:53.220]   just maybe a quarter of our church, okay?
[00:26:53.220 --> 00:26:56.420]   So in the event you are willing to,
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:58.820]   it give you a reason to clean your house and stuff,
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.380]   but if you're willing to host a Thanksgiving dinner,
[00:27:02.380 --> 00:27:06.840]   we do need more host homes, okay?
[00:27:06.840 --> 00:27:09.060]   One last very important announcement.
[00:27:09.060 --> 00:27:13.860]   Our church, we're having a cleaning and maintenance day
[00:27:13.860 --> 00:27:17.160]   on Saturday, October 7th at 9 a.m.
[00:27:17.160 --> 00:27:19.900]   Refreshments and coffee is gonna be provided.
[00:27:19.900 --> 00:27:24.900]   If you guys can, right now, check your calendars,
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:27.120]   and if you are able to help
[00:27:27.120 --> 00:27:31.720]   beautify the facilities of our church campus,
[00:27:31.720 --> 00:27:36.600]   please go on this right now and sign up for that.
[00:27:36.600 --> 00:27:39.460]   And I'll give you like seven seconds.
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:42.660]   (coughing)
[00:27:42.660 --> 00:27:49.180]   Okay.
[00:27:49.180 --> 00:27:54.180]   And then here are the prep questions for September 27th.
[00:27:54.180 --> 00:27:58.580]   It's to read, (coughing)
[00:27:58.580 --> 00:27:59.420]   excuse me,
[00:27:59.420 --> 00:28:04.700]   read and inductively prepare.
[00:28:04.700 --> 00:28:08.060]   The last six verse seven, (coughing)
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:09.900]   (laughing)
[00:28:09.900 --> 00:28:11.120]   It's like a hairball.
[00:28:11.120 --> 00:28:14.980]   Galatians 1, 18 to 24.
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:17.860]   And then question number two,
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.340]   what's the significance of Paul's visit with Cephas
[00:28:21.340 --> 00:28:24.460]   and the apostle James?
[00:28:24.460 --> 00:28:27.100]   One thing you'll discover is that
[00:28:27.100 --> 00:28:31.940]   James, the brother of John, was killed in Acts chapter 12.
[00:28:31.940 --> 00:28:34.460]   This is James, the brother of Jesus.
[00:28:34.460 --> 00:28:36.780]   He's an apostle?
[00:28:37.780 --> 00:28:40.740]   So I'm gonna think through, okay?
[00:28:40.740 --> 00:28:45.300]   And then what exactly were the churches of Judea
[00:28:45.300 --> 00:28:46.620]   glorifying God in?
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.380]   Don't just write down the verse, here, verse 24,
[00:28:50.380 --> 00:28:52.340]   and they were glorifying God because of me.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:54.420]   Like, but what?
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:56.380]   What was it that they were glorifying God in?
[00:28:56.380 --> 00:28:58.020]   Okay?
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.880]   So for tonight, with the remainder of your time,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.740]   these are, so usually before we do the Bible study,
[00:29:05.740 --> 00:29:09.140]   the lesson, a lot of it's giving you an opportunity
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.260]   to share the things that you've wrestled with,
[00:29:11.260 --> 00:29:14.500]   that you've dug into, that you've examined and explored
[00:29:14.500 --> 00:29:18.460]   at home, and now you're sharing with the group.
[00:29:18.460 --> 00:29:20.780]   And then the wrap-up isn't supposed to be like,
[00:29:20.780 --> 00:29:22.140]   I'm gonna answer every question.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:25.240]   A lot of it is to tie in, to lead into application.
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.500]   And then the follow-up discussion
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.180]   is actually supposed to be for a time
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:32.340]   where you're actually not just studying the text
[00:29:32.340 --> 00:29:34.820]   as an academic exercise, but you're trying to figure out,
[00:29:34.820 --> 00:29:37.820]   what does this mean for me as a child of God
[00:29:37.820 --> 00:29:40.740]   to feed off of his word and to submit to his truth?
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:42.140]   What does that mean?
[00:29:42.140 --> 00:29:44.320]   And so these application questions
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.060]   are not here to probe into your life,
[00:29:46.060 --> 00:29:51.060]   it's trying to push you to submit yourselves
[00:29:51.060 --> 00:29:52.780]   to the word of God, okay?
[00:29:52.780 --> 00:29:54.900]   So the first question that I have here
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.880]   is to share briefly about your former manner of life
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:00.460]   outside of Christ, if you are a believer.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:04.660]   If you're not sure whether you're a believer or not,
[00:30:04.660 --> 00:30:07.940]   that's fine to share, okay?
[00:30:07.940 --> 00:30:09.660]   But if you are a believer,
[00:30:09.660 --> 00:30:12.940]   explain what your life was like before Jesus.
[00:30:12.940 --> 00:30:15.360]   How did God call you?
[00:30:15.360 --> 00:30:18.200]   And then to what did God call you?
[00:30:18.200 --> 00:30:21.820]   Some of us may have never thought about this question,
[00:30:21.820 --> 00:30:23.040]   to what did God call me?
[00:30:23.040 --> 00:30:26.100]   Well, duh, the church.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:28.480]   What is your role, okay?
[00:30:28.480 --> 00:30:31.980]   Number two, in what ways are you obedient
[00:30:31.980 --> 00:30:33.940]   to the call of God in your life?
[00:30:33.940 --> 00:30:36.060]   In what ways are you falling short?
[00:30:36.060 --> 00:30:42.320]   Third, do you have zeal for the church of God?
[00:30:42.320 --> 00:30:45.720]   And how do you objectively discern
[00:30:45.720 --> 00:30:50.000]   whether you are building up or hurting the church?
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:51.660]   And what are ways that your group members
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:55.780]   can stimulate you towards love and good deeds?
[00:30:55.780 --> 00:30:58.340]   Okay, so let me pray for us and then we'll dismiss.
[00:30:59.240 --> 00:31:04.240]   Father, thank you for the joy of just diving into hard texts
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:08.120]   like we see here in Galatians 1.
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:12.320]   I pray that you would give us just insight,
[00:31:12.320 --> 00:31:17.140]   give us just a heart that just really desires
[00:31:17.140 --> 00:31:19.720]   to submit ourselves to all of your truth.
[00:31:19.720 --> 00:31:22.920]   So we pray that as we fellowship,
[00:31:22.920 --> 00:31:25.680]   that it will be centered on Christ,
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:28.660]   that we will be really hedged in by your word
[00:31:28.660 --> 00:31:31.880]   and your truth, and cause us, Lord God,
[00:31:31.880 --> 00:31:34.180]   just to be humble before one another,
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:36.360]   to be vulnerable before one another,
[00:31:36.360 --> 00:31:41.080]   to really love each other, and to lift one another up,
[00:31:41.080 --> 00:31:43.760]   Lord, for your glory and for our joy.
[00:31:43.760 --> 00:31:45.920]   So we thank you, Lord, for our time,
[00:31:45.920 --> 00:31:47.520]   and we pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:31:47.520 --> 00:31:48.360]   Amen.
[00:31:48.980 --> 00:31:51.980]   (people chattering)
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:54.140]   (silence)
[00:31:54.140 --> 00:31:56.300]   (silence)
[00:31:56.300 --> 00:31:58.460]   (silence)
