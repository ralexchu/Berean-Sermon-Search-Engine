[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.320]   Our God, we want to thank you for your precious word.
[00:00:07.320 --> 00:00:12.120]   Pray Lord, God, that you would cause your word to affect us deeply.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.000]   Would your spirit convict us of the various sins in our lives?
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:22.040]   Would your spirit convict us of the righteous standard of our Lord and cause us, Lord, to
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:28.360]   be empowered, to put aside the things that are unpleasing to you, to put aside the things
[00:00:28.360 --> 00:00:34.160]   that are offensive to you, Lord, and desire all the more to reflect Christ in our lives.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:39.800]   We desire this, Lord, God, in our everyday, whether we're at work, home, school, whatever
[00:00:39.800 --> 00:00:46.440]   it may be, that God, we would truly be imitators of the Lord in all of his character.
[00:00:46.440 --> 00:00:49.960]   And I pray, God, that you would continue to guide us to that goal.
[00:00:49.960 --> 00:00:52.480]   We thank you, Lord, in Christ's name.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:53.480]   Amen.
[00:00:53.480 --> 00:00:54.480]   Okay.
[00:00:54.480 --> 00:00:55.680]   All right.
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:01:02.640]   So as you guys know, Pastor Peter and the family are leaving tonight, actually.
[00:01:02.640 --> 00:01:07.360]   They're going to be visiting China area and then heading out to Korea and then come back
[00:01:07.360 --> 00:01:08.360]   in about a week.
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:11.600]   So tonight, we'll be covering this passage.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:15.600]   Before I forget, I do want to mention that because the collegians are on their spring
[00:01:15.600 --> 00:01:22.120]   break, we again need to wrap things up and reset the sanctuary after the study's over.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:25.640]   So when your group is done with discussion and all that kind of stuff, and you're headed
[00:01:25.640 --> 00:01:30.660]   off to get some snacks, please make sure just to stack away your table and your chairs.
[00:01:30.660 --> 00:01:35.280]   And then around 10, 15-ish, after we've had some snacks, then we'll bring the brown chairs
[00:01:35.280 --> 00:01:36.280]   back in.
[00:01:36.280 --> 00:01:37.280]   Okay?
[00:01:37.280 --> 00:01:38.280]   All right.
[00:01:38.280 --> 00:01:45.760]   Well, because we've been giving several Bible study tips, remember that those are all various
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:50.040]   tips that should be helpful for you in your study.
[00:01:50.040 --> 00:01:54.800]   Last time we talked about using tools, like using the Strong's numbers to look at a specific
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:01:55.800]   word.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:58.400]   Previously, we talked about identifying specific things.
[00:01:58.400 --> 00:02:04.280]   Well, I just want to say for today's just super brief tip, remember that we're never
[00:02:04.280 --> 00:02:06.400]   going to glean everything in one shot.
[00:02:06.400 --> 00:02:07.400]   All right?
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.120]   You don't clean your teeth in one brush and say, "Done."
[00:02:11.120 --> 00:02:12.600]   Then you would have tons of plaque.
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:18.200]   The whole idea is through repeated process of reading and observing, you're going to
[00:02:18.200 --> 00:02:21.640]   glean lots of different facets of the passage.
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:27.800]   What I recommend typically is that if you're doing not just a broad reading, because sometimes
[00:02:27.800 --> 00:02:32.240]   it's just good to go through the Bible in its flow, so you just do a long reading.
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:36.240]   But if you're doing a smaller portion and you're reading it methodically, it's good
[00:02:36.240 --> 00:02:38.160]   to read it multiple times.
[00:02:38.160 --> 00:02:43.680]   And in those times of reading, I recommend definitely reading things in context.
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:50.520]   So for tonight too, let's make sure to read this from verse one down to verse nine.
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.000]   So I'm going to start from verse nine.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:59.080]   It says, "Therefore, if you have been raised up with Christ, keep seeking the things above.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.840]   Since Christ is seated at the right hand of God, set your mind on the things above, not
[00:03:03.840 --> 00:03:06.000]   on the things that are on earth.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:09.400]   For you have died and your life is hidden with Christ in God.
[00:03:09.400 --> 00:03:13.720]   When Christ, who is our life, is revealed, then you also will be revealed with him in
[00:03:13.720 --> 00:03:14.720]   glory.
[00:03:14.720 --> 00:03:21.120]   Therefore, consider the members of your earthly body as dead to immorality, impurity, passion,
[00:03:21.120 --> 00:03:24.480]   evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.
[00:03:24.480 --> 00:03:29.360]   For it is because of these things that the wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience.
[00:03:29.360 --> 00:03:34.720]   And in them you also once walked when you were living in them, but now you also put
[00:03:34.720 --> 00:03:41.500]   them all aside, anger, wrath, malice, slander, and abusive speech from your mouth.
[00:03:41.500 --> 00:03:47.440]   Do not lie to one another, since you laid aside the old self with its evil practices."
[00:03:47.440 --> 00:03:48.440]   Okay?
[00:03:48.440 --> 00:03:55.480]   We take a moment to pause there, but you know that in context, you actually see a good flow
[00:03:55.480 --> 00:03:59.420]   even from verse one all the way through verse nine.
[00:03:59.420 --> 00:04:03.440]   Starting with verse one saying, "If you've been raised with Christ," and then with verse
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:09.560]   nine saying, "Since you have already put aside the old self and its evil practices."
[00:04:09.560 --> 00:04:11.900]   It's tying all this stuff together.
[00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:17.740]   And if you read on, this whole section from verses one down through verse 17, you know
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:22.360]   that the main thrust of it is going to be your transformation.
[00:04:22.360 --> 00:04:27.760]   This application of portion is going to be your transformation in the death and resurrection
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:33.080]   of Christ, realizing you putting off the old man and putting on things that are resembling
[00:04:33.080 --> 00:04:34.760]   of our Lord.
[00:04:34.760 --> 00:04:35.920]   Okay?
[00:04:35.920 --> 00:04:43.000]   Also, as the quick tip goes, remember that we want to read again to make sure that we
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:45.920]   understand and see the flow of thought.
[00:04:45.920 --> 00:04:49.660]   This I've mentioned before, so I'm not going to spend a whole lot of time, but whenever
[00:04:49.660 --> 00:04:52.440]   I read, I love these words.
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:55.560]   It's kind of weird saying I love these words, right?
[00:04:55.560 --> 00:04:56.560]   Transitional words.
[00:04:56.560 --> 00:05:01.360]   It says, "Therefore," and then you have, you identify some of these things.
[00:05:01.360 --> 00:05:07.760]   I'm going to save the command for a little bit later, but later on when it says, "For,"
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:10.000]   do you love prepositions?
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:11.000]   Prepositions are your friend.
[00:05:11.000 --> 00:05:14.120]   They tell you how the thought flows.
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:18.840]   The "for" tells you the idea of "for it is because," okay?
[00:05:18.840 --> 00:05:26.440]   These contrasting words of, "But now," those are good flow words to think through.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:28.680]   And it says, "Do not lie to one another."
[00:05:28.680 --> 00:05:30.240]   So typically, guess what?
[00:05:30.240 --> 00:05:32.200]   If I highlighted those three transition...
[00:05:32.200 --> 00:05:33.840]   Oops, I used purple before.
[00:05:33.840 --> 00:05:38.200]   If I highlighted those three transitional words, typically I can give you a three-point
[00:05:38.200 --> 00:05:40.240]   outline, right?
[00:05:40.240 --> 00:05:44.080]   Three points of the thoughts and flow of that paragraph.
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.800]   What's more, the tip is make sure you're reading for observation and identification.
[00:05:48.800 --> 00:05:55.560]   This is where you're making sure that you're highlighting especially key commands.
[00:05:55.560 --> 00:05:59.480]   If you're reading Old Testament, you want to look at the verbs because the language
[00:05:59.480 --> 00:06:01.920]   itself is a very verbal language.
[00:06:01.920 --> 00:06:05.760]   When you're looking at the New Testament, you also want to make sure you're paying special
[00:06:05.760 --> 00:06:07.520]   attention to the verbs.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:13.920]   So when it tells you to consider dead, when it tells you, let's see, down later on, that
[00:06:13.920 --> 00:06:18.480]   you need to put them all aside, and then when it tells you, "Do not lie," you see those
[00:06:18.480 --> 00:06:23.060]   commandments and I can give you another three-point outline, right?
[00:06:23.060 --> 00:06:29.080]   You can get the main thrust and the themes from identifying those special terms.
[00:06:29.080 --> 00:06:30.760]   Then the rest of it, you guys know.
[00:06:30.760 --> 00:06:33.360]   You should read it again to ask those questions.
[00:06:33.360 --> 00:06:34.400]   Why?
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:36.520]   Why is there two laundry lists?
[00:06:36.520 --> 00:06:39.740]   Why are the two laundry lists separated?
[00:06:39.740 --> 00:06:42.920]   Why does everything amount to idolatry?
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:43.920]   Why?
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:44.920]   How come?
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:46.280]   Why is that there?
[00:06:46.280 --> 00:06:47.280]   Why is...
[00:06:47.280 --> 00:06:48.600]   And somebody asked a good question on it.
[00:06:48.600 --> 00:06:51.160]   Why is lying separated from that list?
[00:06:51.160 --> 00:06:52.440]   Does it have a place of prominence?
[00:06:52.440 --> 00:06:55.280]   And you ask a bunch of questions.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.880]   And then you wanna make sure you read it again to give it that summary, to make sure you
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:07.460]   understand the thrust of the passage and you are able to actually give a concise understanding
[00:07:07.460 --> 00:07:10.880]   of what the convicting message of that passage is, right?
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:16.160]   So typically, again, Pastor Peter repeatedly said this, so I'm not gonna spend too much
[00:07:16.160 --> 00:07:21.520]   more time on this, but the process of that repeated observation is going to lead you
[00:07:21.520 --> 00:07:26.800]   to identifying certain things that are far above what you can glean from, let's say,
[00:07:26.800 --> 00:07:31.120]   oh, in a morning's devotional passage from a one-page book that you're reading or something
[00:07:31.120 --> 00:07:32.120]   like that.
[00:07:32.120 --> 00:07:34.320]   You're gonna gain a lot more.
[00:07:34.320 --> 00:07:35.400]   Okay.
[00:07:35.400 --> 00:07:37.880]   Now for us then, let's jump in.
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:45.440]   Here, starting from the "therefore," we already realized that there were many commandments
[00:07:45.440 --> 00:07:47.640]   before this.
[00:07:47.640 --> 00:07:49.640]   Okay?
[00:07:49.640 --> 00:07:56.240]   There were commandments that you should keep seeking the things above where Christ is seated,
[00:07:56.240 --> 00:07:57.360]   right?
[00:07:57.360 --> 00:08:02.520]   The whole mentality is that your mind, your thoughts, your heart, your desire and longing
[00:08:02.520 --> 00:08:04.280]   should be with Christ.
[00:08:04.280 --> 00:08:09.920]   So when it comes to here, this command, the one commandment, we have to keep in mind that
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:12.740]   this is connected to all that, right?
[00:08:12.740 --> 00:08:14.720]   It's an outflow of all that.
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:19.400]   And so we take a look at this first commandment of considering the members of your earthly
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:21.600]   body as dead.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:22.920]   Okay?
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:25.320]   Let's take a moment to think about that.
[00:08:25.320 --> 00:08:32.720]   Because if you practice the comparing and contrasting different versions of this passage,
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:38.280]   whether you look at the NASB or, sorry, ESB or the NIV, you would immediately recognize
[00:08:38.280 --> 00:08:42.600]   like, hey, that command seems a little bit different, right?
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:46.120]   For example, the NIV will say, "Put to death therefore."
[00:08:46.120 --> 00:08:51.400]   The King James will say, "Mortify therefore your members which are upon the earth."
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.800]   Okay?
[00:08:52.800 --> 00:08:54.480]   And you gotta wonder like, how come?
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:57.080]   Why did it sound a little bit different?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.760]   All I'm gonna say is this.
[00:08:58.760 --> 00:09:06.520]   It seems to me that the NASB tried to keep the contextual flow that your life dead and
[00:09:06.520 --> 00:09:13.320]   resurrected in Christ should cause you to consider your earthly members than dead, right?
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:19.000]   However, in terms of that passage, it is more in tune with the original Greek to say as
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:23.440]   a more emphatic command, "Put to death therefore."
[00:09:23.440 --> 00:09:28.960]   In the Greek, the placement of the verbs actually matter as points of emphasis.
[00:09:28.960 --> 00:09:32.160]   And very clearly, it comes first.
[00:09:32.160 --> 00:09:36.860]   It reads, "Put to death therefore," rather than, "Therefore put to death," right?
[00:09:36.860 --> 00:09:43.120]   So the whole idea that I'm saying is, there is an emphatic challenge and command for us
[00:09:43.120 --> 00:09:46.840]   to put to death the sins that are in our lives.
[00:09:46.840 --> 00:09:52.640]   We take a moment to think about this and later in verse 8, he has this very similar command
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:55.240]   just put in different terminology.
[00:09:55.240 --> 00:09:57.880]   Where he says, "Put aside all these things."
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:10:01.160]   Put them all aside, he says.
[00:10:01.160 --> 00:10:03.280]   And that means for us to renounce.
[00:10:03.280 --> 00:10:08.840]   That means for us to cast away and shed like dirty clothing those things that are part
[00:10:08.840 --> 00:10:10.440]   of our earthly body.
[00:10:10.440 --> 00:10:13.280]   Those things that are part of our flesh.
[00:10:13.280 --> 00:10:14.480]   Okay?
[00:10:14.480 --> 00:10:18.440]   Now let's take a moment to think about this then.
[00:10:18.440 --> 00:10:22.520]   We could sit and ask questions about, "Well, what does it mean our earthly body?
[00:10:22.520 --> 00:10:24.080]   What does it mean our members?"
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:27.120]   No it doesn't mean the members you don't like in the church.
[00:10:27.120 --> 00:10:31.680]   And no, it doesn't mean just your hand because your hand makes you to sin.
[00:10:31.680 --> 00:10:36.000]   It is very, very clear throughout the rest of the passage, the various things you need
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:37.760]   to put aside.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:42.360]   But let's take a moment to feel the conviction of that command when we think about this idea
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:45.680]   of put to death.
[00:10:45.680 --> 00:10:51.520]   We have to remember that this command in order for us to own it and receive it, we have to
[00:10:51.520 --> 00:10:54.800]   feel the burden of responsibility.
[00:10:54.800 --> 00:10:56.600]   Right?
[00:10:56.600 --> 00:11:02.280]   We have to feel the burden of responsibility that the death of the old habits, the death
[00:11:02.280 --> 00:11:05.720]   and then you start thinking about the long, I call it the laundry list because man it's
[00:11:05.720 --> 00:11:08.280]   just boom, boom, boom, boom of convicting points.
[00:11:08.280 --> 00:11:13.560]   Are there immoralities, impurities, the passions, the evil desires, the greed, the anger, the
[00:11:13.560 --> 00:11:16.280]   malice, the wrath, all those things.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:22.520]   It's your responsibility to put to death and you have to bear that responsibility.
[00:11:22.520 --> 00:11:28.760]   What I'm saying is, I find that as I'm doing lots of counseling, as I find that as I hear
[00:11:28.760 --> 00:11:34.720]   people complaining about sometimes where their sanctification is, I find that there are lots
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:40.240]   of individuals who use euthemisms for where they are.
[00:11:40.240 --> 00:11:45.040]   If let's say they find that they're in the midst of struggling with immoral, sexually
[00:11:45.040 --> 00:11:48.320]   explicit material on the internet, whatever it may be.
[00:11:48.320 --> 00:11:52.480]   Let's say maybe they're being tempted and they find that their eyes are wandering.
[00:11:52.480 --> 00:11:56.280]   And then rather than talking about that like, "Wow, I've got these evil, wicked desires
[00:11:56.280 --> 00:11:57.640]   in my heart."
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:12:01.160]   They talk about it like, "Oh goodness, there's a struggle."
[00:12:01.160 --> 00:12:05.720]   And sometimes I feel like there isn't that intense passion for Jesus anymore.
[00:12:05.720 --> 00:12:07.560]   The affection is just not there.
[00:12:07.560 --> 00:12:10.960]   I'm not feeling that kind of fire anymore.
[00:12:10.960 --> 00:12:13.840]   You guys know what I'm talking about now, right?
[00:12:13.840 --> 00:12:21.360]   Certain times we find ourselves in moments of compromise and sin and we use really euphemistic
[00:12:21.360 --> 00:12:23.800]   terminology to talk about it.
[00:12:23.800 --> 00:12:28.240]   When you do that, you diminish that ownership.
[00:12:28.240 --> 00:12:35.440]   You diminish that sense of responsibility that I have to purposely, intentionally identify
[00:12:35.440 --> 00:12:39.140]   the various things that I need to put to death.
[00:12:39.140 --> 00:12:41.800]   It doesn't happen just because.
[00:12:41.800 --> 00:12:44.960]   It doesn't happen because you complain God's not doing it for you.
[00:12:44.960 --> 00:12:47.640]   It just doesn't happen automatically.
[00:12:47.640 --> 00:12:51.560]   But rather the command for us is, "You need to be doing this."
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:56.460]   If you please turn your Bibles over to Romans chapter 8, there's an important cross-reference
[00:12:56.460 --> 00:13:02.480]   that we need to understand to feel that kind of exhortation, "You have to be active in
[00:13:02.480 --> 00:13:03.960]   this.
[00:13:03.960 --> 00:13:08.320]   You have to be the one diligent to put to death these various things we're gonna learn
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.040]   about today."
[00:13:11.040 --> 00:13:15.040]   And the passage is Romans chapter 8, verses 12 through 14.
[00:13:15.040 --> 00:13:19.640]   And the passage says, "So then, brethren, we are under obligation not to the flesh to
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:21.400]   live according to the flesh.
[00:13:21.400 --> 00:13:26.360]   For if you are living according to the flesh, you must die.
[00:13:26.360 --> 00:13:30.820]   But if by the Spirit you're putting to death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:13:30.820 --> 00:13:38.120]   For all who are being led by the Spirit of God, these are the sons of God."
[00:13:38.120 --> 00:13:44.320]   There's an expectation that actively, with a sense of urgency, you are by the Spirit
[00:13:44.320 --> 00:13:48.480]   putting to death the deeds of the flesh.
[00:13:48.480 --> 00:13:50.680]   It doesn't just go away.
[00:13:50.680 --> 00:13:53.860]   Not because you place yourself in the right context.
[00:13:53.860 --> 00:13:59.100]   Not because you've placed yourself around certain people and influences, but because
[00:13:59.100 --> 00:14:02.920]   you're actively identifying and killing those sins.
[00:14:02.920 --> 00:14:03.920]   Okay.
[00:14:03.920 --> 00:14:07.480]   So, we'll stop there and move to the next section.
[00:14:07.480 --> 00:14:12.400]   He says, "Put to death, or consider the members of the earthly body as dead."
[00:14:12.400 --> 00:14:13.840]   And then he describes it.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:19.600]   And so, if these were the commands of this is the put to death, these would be the targets.
[00:14:19.600 --> 00:14:22.440]   The sample targets of what you need to put away.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.680]   That's the way I labeled it, okay?
[00:14:25.680 --> 00:14:33.200]   And he describes here that you need to consider dead or put to death, immorality, impurity,
[00:14:33.200 --> 00:14:39.360]   passion, evil desire, and greed, which amounts to idolatry.
[00:14:39.360 --> 00:14:44.840]   When you look at this passage, you definitely have to carefully take a look and say, "Hmm.
[00:14:44.840 --> 00:14:48.560]   Are there relationships between the words in this list?"
[00:14:48.560 --> 00:14:49.560]   Right?
[00:14:49.560 --> 00:14:51.220]   And what is that relationship?
[00:14:51.220 --> 00:14:53.600]   Why are they categorized this way?
[00:14:53.600 --> 00:14:56.440]   And then secondly, you've gotta ask, "Hmm.
[00:14:56.440 --> 00:15:06.000]   This seems really important because, man, I don't know if I categorized or identified...
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:11.820]   If I had greed, if I identified that as idolatry, right?
[00:15:11.820 --> 00:15:15.880]   If I have the image right now, if I can give you that image of a bunch of individuals just
[00:15:15.880 --> 00:15:23.240]   bowing down to a gold piece of cow-looking, goat-looking, whatever it may be, that kind
[00:15:23.240 --> 00:15:28.200]   of imagery is exactly what Apostle Paul is saying that this greed, evil desire, passion,
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.980]   impurity, and immorality amounts to.
[00:15:29.980 --> 00:15:34.380]   And you've gotta ask, "Let's make sense of that.
[00:15:34.380 --> 00:15:40.780]   How are these maybe desires and immoralities, how do they sum up to be idolatry?"
[00:15:40.780 --> 00:15:41.780]   Okay?
[00:15:41.960 --> 00:15:44.440]   What I'd like to say just briefly is this.
[00:15:44.440 --> 00:15:50.320]   What seems to me really clear, I'm gonna draw a little line here, and here in these sins,
[00:15:50.320 --> 00:15:54.960]   immorality, impurity, and passion, they're talking about sexual lust.
[00:15:54.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   Okay?
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.160]   If you guys did the thing that Pastor Peter talked about, looking up the words, I'm not
[00:16:00.160 --> 00:16:02.760]   gonna go through every single one now for the sake of time.
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:06.000]   If you didn't get a chance to do it, go do it.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   Use the...
[00:16:07.380 --> 00:16:14.660]   I really like the website blueletterbible.com, 'cause you can do it just right down the line.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:18.940]   Somebody posted on our church website that Logos in terms of the base passage is available,
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:21.140]   and you can just use that program to click it.
[00:16:21.140 --> 00:16:27.180]   But these terms are like pornea and pathos and things like that, is talking about things
[00:16:27.180 --> 00:16:32.340]   that are sexual perversions, lewd acts, lustfulness.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:43.020]   So these three terms, they are expressions of sexual sin.
[00:16:43.020 --> 00:16:48.500]   And what seems to be pretty clear, however, is that these right here are pointing to the
[00:16:48.500 --> 00:16:53.160]   internal workings of those sexual sins.
[00:16:53.160 --> 00:17:00.740]   That the evil desires and the greed in your heart lead and ultimately express itself to
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:02.500]   those sexual sins.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:04.020]   I drew you guys a little graph.
[00:17:04.020 --> 00:17:08.700]   Not a graph, but a chart.
[00:17:08.700 --> 00:17:17.620]   I definitely believe that there is a progression, a progression of the sins that are produced.
[00:17:17.620 --> 00:17:24.580]   And what I'm gonna say is, a worldview or an individual's idolatrous or covetous begins
[00:17:24.580 --> 00:17:30.540]   to have great passions and evil desires, and that produces actions of immorality and impurity.
[00:17:30.540 --> 00:17:32.740]   I think that's the way I like to say it.
[00:17:32.740 --> 00:17:37.260]   And the reason why I say this is because I'm gonna take a moment to think about the covetousness.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:39.300]   Do you know what covetousness is?
[00:17:39.300 --> 00:17:41.160]   It's simply you believing.
[00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:42.920]   It's a belief system.
[00:17:42.920 --> 00:17:47.060]   When you believe, "I deserve more.
[00:17:47.060 --> 00:17:52.220]   I am owed by this country, by these people, by this God, more than what I have now.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.000]   I'm getting gypped."
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:00.260]   That mentality is the worldview that produces evil desire in you.
[00:18:00.260 --> 00:18:05.260]   And the next thing I wanna show you is this.
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:07.100]   Hold on.
[00:18:07.100 --> 00:18:08.660]   Here.
[00:18:08.660 --> 00:18:15.380]   Next thing I wanna show you is those desires set upon an individual, people, is going to
[00:18:15.380 --> 00:18:17.740]   lead to sexual immorality.
[00:18:17.740 --> 00:18:23.500]   When you believe that you are deserving of more, and when you believe that you are actually
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:31.220]   in place of the Lord, deserving to be served, glorified, honored, and whatever it may be,
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:35.820]   pleased by all these various different elements, you're gonna have all these kinds of expressions
[00:18:35.820 --> 00:18:37.020]   of sins.
[00:18:37.020 --> 00:18:41.820]   And one that has particularly plagued all of mankind for as long as they've sinned is
[00:18:41.820 --> 00:18:43.580]   sexual immorality.
[00:18:43.580 --> 00:18:47.900]   When they look upon people as possessions.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:50.100]   You know, I'm gonna say this.
[00:18:50.100 --> 00:18:56.420]   Generally speaking, typically speaking, whether it's a young man or an individual who is falling
[00:18:56.420 --> 00:19:02.440]   to sexual immorality, they are arrogant individuals who believe they're kings.
[00:19:02.440 --> 00:19:06.560]   They have a King Solomon syndrome where they wish at some point or another that they could
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:10.660]   have a harem of thousands of women to serve them.
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:14.140]   They're not thinking of themselves as lowly individuals, "Oh, woe is me."
[00:19:14.140 --> 00:19:19.380]   No, they're thinking of themselves as kings on a throne to have women serve them.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:24.500]   And that's why typically when I counsel individuals, it's when they come back from work and their
[00:19:24.500 --> 00:19:28.140]   boss treats them unfairly, they come home and it's like, "I deserve better than that.
[00:19:28.140 --> 00:19:29.340]   They can't treat me this way."
[00:19:29.340 --> 00:19:36.700]   And then they run to using sexual immorality to feed their ego, to feed their arrogance.
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.640]   There's a connection to all this.
[00:19:38.640 --> 00:19:42.560]   And so I wanted to show you this little chart that I drew up here.
[00:19:42.560 --> 00:19:48.060]   The way it should be is you and all of creation should be pleasing, serving, and loyal to
[00:19:48.060 --> 00:19:49.580]   God.
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:52.980]   The reason why all of that stuff amounts to idolatry when it comes to all those sexual
[00:19:52.980 --> 00:19:57.260]   immoralities, your greed and your evil desires is because you turn around.
[00:19:57.260 --> 00:20:02.780]   God and all of creation should serve, worship, empower, and glorify you.
[00:20:02.780 --> 00:20:04.500]   You are the idol.
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:06.780]   You become the center of the universe.
[00:20:06.780 --> 00:20:14.340]   And therefore, you set yourself up as opposition to God's design.
[00:20:14.340 --> 00:20:18.660]   I hope that kind of helped answer those two questions.
[00:20:18.660 --> 00:20:21.100]   Why is there this list?
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:22.300]   And is there a progression?
[00:20:22.300 --> 00:20:25.380]   And how does all of that amount to idolatry?
[00:20:25.380 --> 00:20:26.660]   Okay?
[00:20:26.660 --> 00:20:35.420]   Now when we go back to our passage then, let's go to the next section right here.
[00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:42.500]   If the command was put to death, this is the why.
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.660]   And it's kind of surprising.
[00:20:44.660 --> 00:20:48.940]   Because what Apostle Paul does is he says, "For it is because of these things that the
[00:20:48.940 --> 00:20:53.220]   wrath of God will come upon the sons of disobedience."
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:20:59.060]   What's really clear here is when you ask the question, "What is the rationale?"
[00:20:59.060 --> 00:21:03.100]   The why that Apostle gives in this particular section, and I'm going to cut it off right
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:05.700]   here for six and seven.
[00:21:05.700 --> 00:21:07.940]   The question is, "What is the rationale?"
[00:21:07.940 --> 00:21:11.140]   And you can even use the word "motivation."
[00:21:11.140 --> 00:21:16.540]   What is the motivation that Apostle Paul gives for us to actively put to death those things
[00:21:16.540 --> 00:21:17.540]   that are sinful?
[00:21:17.540 --> 00:21:20.340]   And I want to highlight two things.
[00:21:20.340 --> 00:21:26.660]   One is the wrath of God, and two, it's your inconsistency.
[00:21:26.660 --> 00:21:29.700]   Or you can say this, because this was your former life, right?
[00:21:29.700 --> 00:21:34.020]   This was the once you were living.
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:37.380]   It's inconsistent with who you are now.
[00:21:37.380 --> 00:21:41.980]   So there were the two things that I see here, one and two.
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:44.900]   And so let's take a moment to talk about that a little bit.
[00:21:44.900 --> 00:21:51.700]   The first of the why should I, and he says it's because God righteously judges by his
[00:21:51.700 --> 00:21:54.220]   wrath.
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.660]   That should immediately invoke fear in us.
[00:21:57.660 --> 00:22:02.620]   But here, one thing is very true, is that we very much get accustomed.
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:05.340]   We very much get accustomed to grace.
[00:22:05.340 --> 00:22:08.620]   I'm not sure if you guys have ever been in a class where your professor is a little bit
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:09.620]   lazy.
[00:22:09.620 --> 00:22:11.420]   Have you guys ever been in one of those?
[00:22:11.420 --> 00:22:15.580]   And so each Friday, he's like, "Ah, you know what, you guys, this Friday we're just not
[00:22:15.580 --> 00:22:16.980]   going to have a quiz."
[00:22:16.980 --> 00:22:19.580]   Next week rolls around, he says, "Ah, you guys, this week we're not going to have a
[00:22:19.580 --> 00:22:20.580]   quiz."
[00:22:20.580 --> 00:22:22.740]   And the next thing you know, the third week, he's like, "You know what, guys, we're going
[00:22:22.740 --> 00:22:23.740]   to have a quiz."
[00:22:23.740 --> 00:22:24.740]   And everyone's like, "Oh, what?
[00:22:24.740 --> 00:22:25.740]   That's not fair."
[00:22:25.740 --> 00:22:26.740]   Right?
[00:22:26.740 --> 00:22:32.180]   I mean, typically we just get naturally accustomed to grace.
[00:22:32.180 --> 00:22:37.060]   But the fact of the matter is that we have to keep in mind, it's not so much like, "You
[00:22:37.060 --> 00:22:41.660]   guys need to fear God's wrath is coming, like, right now."
[00:22:41.660 --> 00:22:46.680]   The way I like to say it is this, God has always been the same.
[00:22:46.680 --> 00:22:50.000]   You just think he's different right now.
[00:22:50.000 --> 00:22:54.260]   God has always been fearsome, and God has always been merciful.
[00:22:54.260 --> 00:22:55.420]   Amen?
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:23:01.420]   It's just our common, fallen, weird, twisted thing we do in our head where we assume he's
[00:23:01.420 --> 00:23:02.420]   changed.
[00:23:02.420 --> 00:23:03.420]   He's not.
[00:23:03.420 --> 00:23:08.460]   As a matter of fact, scripture says, like, "God is not mocked.
[00:23:08.460 --> 00:23:14.100]   You're going to reap what you sow, and God is going to give a just recompense for the
[00:23:14.100 --> 00:23:15.980]   things that you've done."
[00:23:15.980 --> 00:23:18.700]   The fact of the matter is, God is not partial.
[00:23:18.700 --> 00:23:23.180]   He is exacting, and his wrath is fearsome.
[00:23:23.180 --> 00:23:29.940]   It's that we have been given the unique, unique mercy to hear the message of grace.
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.220]   Amen?
[00:23:31.220 --> 00:23:36.180]   But God is exactly the same as he was in the Old Testament as he is today.
[00:23:36.180 --> 00:23:37.540]   And therefore, we should fear.
[00:23:37.540 --> 00:23:40.740]   There should be a healthy, godly fear.
[00:23:40.740 --> 00:23:47.900]   But what's more, I think this is super important if you take a moment to think about this.
[00:23:47.900 --> 00:23:52.180]   Combine verse seven with the rationale.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:59.300]   So here you have certain terms that you start thinking, like, "For, because, since," and
[00:23:59.300 --> 00:24:02.380]   earlier, oh, it was verse five, uh, verse one, right?
[00:24:02.380 --> 00:24:04.420]   I don't have it here, so.
[00:24:04.420 --> 00:24:09.900]   When you start thinking about that, I love it because Apostle Paul is, like, so reasonable,
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.540]   you know?
[00:24:12.540 --> 00:24:16.780]   He works with you to help you understand!
[00:24:16.780 --> 00:24:20.580]   But the thing he's talking about right here in verse seven, it says, "Look, in them you
[00:24:20.580 --> 00:24:24.660]   once walked when you were living in them," and then this whole command to put them all
[00:24:24.660 --> 00:24:30.660]   aside, he says, "Since you already laid aside the old self with evil practices," right?
[00:24:30.660 --> 00:24:33.020]   And you think about that for a moment.
[00:24:33.020 --> 00:24:39.460]   And this command for us to put aside and put to death is exactly what already took place
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:41.900]   at the moment of salvation.
[00:24:41.900 --> 00:24:47.340]   When we received Jesus Christ, we already said, "I am willing to put aside my ambition,
[00:24:47.340 --> 00:24:52.700]   I'm willing to put aside my desires, I'm willing to put aside my self-esteem, whatever it is
[00:24:52.700 --> 00:24:59.060]   in my inclination to preserve me, I've already surrendered it to you."
[00:24:59.060 --> 00:25:00.060]   Right?
[00:25:00.060 --> 00:25:04.100]   And the reason why this is so important is because we're going back to the base of the
[00:25:04.100 --> 00:25:11.680]   Gospel, saying, "God, I've already surrendered everything, and I've died in Christ."
[00:25:11.680 --> 00:25:17.980]   And so now, when somebody starts saying, "Man, I hear that challenging command to go put
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:24.060]   to death my sin, my lust," this thing that, you know, for some people, they've been struggling
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:28.700]   for years and years, and if there's anything that someone has said, like, "I just don't
[00:25:28.700 --> 00:25:33.060]   think I can overcome this," a lot of times, it's lust.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:37.580]   Well, we gotta start asking this question.
[00:25:37.580 --> 00:25:40.500]   Not so much like, "Oh, have you ever reconciled with Jesus?"
[00:25:40.500 --> 00:25:47.380]   But, man, is it really, really something where you just can't and you have no power?
[00:25:47.380 --> 00:25:51.180]   Or is it more on the lines of, "You've forgotten," right?
[00:25:51.180 --> 00:25:54.180]   "You've forgotten the power that God has given you."
[00:25:54.180 --> 00:26:00.100]   Is it more just simply, "Man, I really think that my flesh is so powerful, and I can't,"
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.460]   or is it more so in your heart, you don't want to?
[00:26:03.460 --> 00:26:09.620]   We gotta start asking some really deep, sometimes excruciating questions.
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:13.940]   If someone is starting to say, "I think I can't.
[00:26:13.940 --> 00:26:18.540]   From my experience, from my failures, from my track record, I can't.
[00:26:18.540 --> 00:26:21.380]   This passage is teaching us otherwise."
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:26.220]   The rationale is you already have, right?
[00:26:26.220 --> 00:26:28.540]   You know what this is all about.
[00:26:28.540 --> 00:26:33.780]   Go back to the time when you surrendered to Christ and you laid down your personal ambitions,
[00:26:33.780 --> 00:26:36.700]   you've laid down your personal desires.
[00:26:36.700 --> 00:26:41.500]   Go back to the moments when you clearly saw the beauty of Jesus and you recognized, "This
[00:26:41.500 --> 00:26:43.180]   is not even a question.
[00:26:43.180 --> 00:26:47.420]   I choose Christ over any trash."
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:49.460]   You have to go back to that.
[00:26:49.460 --> 00:26:54.540]   So here, in verse six through seven, again, I wanted to give that challenge.
[00:26:54.540 --> 00:27:02.900]   It is an attention to the rationale and to why of the putting to death of our earthly
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:03.900]   members.
[00:27:03.900 --> 00:27:04.900]   Okay?
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:09.700]   So now what we're gonna do is this last section here, and then we'll start wrapping things
[00:27:09.700 --> 00:27:10.700]   up together.
[00:27:10.700 --> 00:27:11.700]   Okay?
[00:27:11.700 --> 00:27:17.420]   In this last section here, I'm gonna say this.
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:23.220]   If all of this, the target was actually idolatry...
[00:27:23.220 --> 00:27:26.660]   Oops, I didn't mean to put it into green because it's sin.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.660]   We're gonna say red.
[00:27:28.660 --> 00:27:30.100]   Okay?
[00:27:30.100 --> 00:27:31.380]   [laughter]
[00:27:31.380 --> 00:27:40.020]   Over here, if it was idolatry, over here, this is what I'm gonna say.
[00:27:40.020 --> 00:27:41.220]   It's kinda weird.
[00:27:41.220 --> 00:27:45.180]   So my titles, I take some time to think about and stuff.
[00:27:45.180 --> 00:27:47.300]   To me, sometimes when I look back, it's a little cheesy.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:52.380]   But what I like to call this is stubborn idolatry.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:54.780]   And I'm gonna explain why.
[00:27:54.780 --> 00:27:57.180]   Okay?
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.100]   He says, "Put them all aside.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:06.040]   Anger, wrath, malice, slander, abusive speech from your mouth.
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.620]   Do not lie to one another."
[00:28:07.620 --> 00:28:08.620]   Okay?
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:11.620]   So let's take a moment to think about these things.
[00:28:11.620 --> 00:28:18.500]   Again, you have to ask the question, what is the rationale between separating these
[00:28:18.500 --> 00:28:21.380]   two lines of lists?
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.820]   Okay?
[00:28:22.820 --> 00:28:30.780]   Also, is there a reason why this list is placed here, but this portion of it is placed here?
[00:28:30.780 --> 00:28:32.520]   Does this have a place of prominence?
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:34.300]   Is it something important?
[00:28:34.300 --> 00:28:36.100]   Okay?
[00:28:36.100 --> 00:28:37.820]   Sometimes you're gonna find the answer, sometimes you're not.
[00:28:37.820 --> 00:28:41.060]   You're gonna kinda take a guess at it, okay?
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:48.100]   But amongst this column of various sins that you see here, do you see any relationship?
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:52.460]   And this is what I'm gonna say, is earlier, what we noticed with the previous section
[00:28:52.460 --> 00:28:57.220]   was that there were expressions of sin, immorality, impurity, passion, and it started pointing
[00:28:57.220 --> 00:29:02.780]   into your heart, evil desires, greed, which is the attitude that's in you producing the
[00:29:02.780 --> 00:29:03.780]   stuff.
[00:29:03.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   Right?
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:10.500]   And then it told you, in summary, all of that at the core nucleus of why you're sinning
[00:29:10.500 --> 00:29:14.820]   is because you placed yourself at the throne.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:15.820]   You're a king.
[00:29:15.820 --> 00:29:16.820]   Okay?
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:21.500]   Well, I think what he's doing is he's doing that kind of come to the heart and now work
[00:29:21.500 --> 00:29:22.500]   your way out.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:28.320]   'Cause if you think about it, anger, wrath, and malice is attitudes of the heart.
[00:29:28.320 --> 00:29:31.220]   So if I were to draw a line, I'd put it right here.
[00:29:31.220 --> 00:29:36.700]   In your heart, when you're angry, and anger kind of talks about that brooding.
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:41.260]   I really, really love looking at the Hebrew words for angry and stuff like that, it's
[00:29:41.260 --> 00:29:42.260]   so vivid.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:45.900]   It talks about the blowing of the nostrils like a raging bull.
[00:29:45.900 --> 00:29:48.820]   In the Greek, it also talks about this brooding.
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:52.740]   There's this wrath where, let's say if you go home, you start punching stuff in your
[00:29:52.740 --> 00:29:54.700]   pillows, that's wrathful, okay?
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:58.620]   If there's malice in your heart, that means you're intent on hurting somebody.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:29:59.620]   Okay?
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:04.580]   But then, that overflows to slander and abusive speech.
[00:30:04.580 --> 00:30:06.140]   Now you use a weapon.
[00:30:06.140 --> 00:30:07.500]   Oh, okay.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.220]   It agreed with me.
[00:30:10.220 --> 00:30:11.220]   Concurs.
[00:30:11.220 --> 00:30:14.680]   Now you use a weapon, and that weapon is your mouth.
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:20.420]   You start slandering individuals, you start using abusive words, harsh words, and then
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:22.120]   you also use lies.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:23.780]   So I have one more.
[00:30:23.780 --> 00:30:27.580]   I don't know if I put it on your piece of paper, but this is the way I would draw it
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:28.940]   up, right?
[00:30:28.940 --> 00:30:34.540]   That there is idolatry in your heart and there's still covetousness.
[00:30:34.540 --> 00:30:40.860]   And then there's these evil desires, and it breeds wrath, anger, malice, slander, abusive
[00:30:40.860 --> 00:30:42.740]   speech, and lies.
[00:30:42.740 --> 00:30:47.380]   Now why in the world, though, did I call it stubborn idolatry?
[00:30:47.380 --> 00:30:49.660]   Is because let me tell you something, right?
[00:30:49.660 --> 00:30:52.620]   When I examine my own heart, okay?
[00:30:52.620 --> 00:30:58.380]   When I want this so bad, and I'm not willing to surrender to this, do you know what happens?
[00:30:58.380 --> 00:31:01.300]   I get angry.
[00:31:01.300 --> 00:31:05.660]   When people are not serving me like they should, when God...
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:06.820]   Oops, sorry about that.
[00:31:06.820 --> 00:31:11.220]   When God is not giving me the expectations that I had, that if he joined my life, that
[00:31:11.220 --> 00:31:15.800]   he would all of a sudden make it more peaceful, more lovely, and good.
[00:31:15.800 --> 00:31:20.100]   If my image is not what I all hoped it to be, you know what I'm getting at, right?
[00:31:20.100 --> 00:31:25.260]   When you are so bent on having this, guess what happens to your heart?
[00:31:25.260 --> 00:31:27.820]   The root of bitterness enters.
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:30.420]   And now you will use weaponized words.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:35.500]   Now you will use various tools to get at what you desire.
[00:31:35.500 --> 00:31:38.180]   And that's why I call it stubborn idolatry.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:45.140]   When you want this so bad that you're willing to slander, that's what you're gonna see.
[00:31:45.140 --> 00:31:50.580]   Then a little while ago, I was actually studying Colossians for another study.
[00:31:50.580 --> 00:31:56.420]   A while back, I taught Colossians for a youth group, and then I posted on the internet a
[00:31:56.420 --> 00:31:59.340]   case counseling scenario.
[00:31:59.340 --> 00:32:02.380]   What if we had a certain individual, okay?
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:05.100]   Let's call this individual Martha, right?
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:08.780]   Martha was not invited to a birthday party that a bunch of the friends were invited,
[00:32:08.780 --> 00:32:12.340]   and all of a sudden, she got really angry, right?
[00:32:12.340 --> 00:32:17.100]   And I posed on there, what if she got so angry, she got so mad, she started to fall away from
[00:32:17.100 --> 00:32:20.220]   the fellowship, and then she decided, "I'm leaving.
[00:32:20.220 --> 00:32:22.140]   This church is horrible."
[00:32:22.140 --> 00:32:23.620]   What went wrong?
[00:32:23.620 --> 00:32:24.620]   How should we counsel her?
[00:32:24.620 --> 00:32:26.300]   And it was very interesting.
[00:32:26.300 --> 00:32:28.100]   People had lots of different responses.
[00:32:28.100 --> 00:32:30.700]   So now you guys know, it's a trap, okay?
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:31.700]   When I put those questions...
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:33.460]   No, it's not a trap.
[00:32:33.460 --> 00:32:40.820]   It's a desire to get you thinking about this stuff, because it's a highly plausible scenario.
[00:32:40.820 --> 00:32:44.300]   You don't wanna get invited, all of a sudden, it's just like, "What do they think about
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   me?"
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   Right?
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:47.300]   You could get very...
[00:32:47.300 --> 00:32:48.300]   How dare they?
[00:32:48.300 --> 00:32:51.500]   You know how many times I've thrown birthday parties for them?
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:53.740]   I thought we were like this, you know?
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:55.660]   And then maybe they'll go home and they'll get really upset.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:32:57.860]   And then, yeah, they'll come home, they'll throw their bag.
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.940]   And all of a sudden, when no one's watching, their wrath comes out.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:01.940]   And then malice sets in.
[00:33:01.940 --> 00:33:02.940]   They'll say, "You know what?
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:03.940]   I'm never inviting them ever."
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:07.740]   They're gonna feel the burn.
[00:33:07.740 --> 00:33:08.740]   The malice sets in.
[00:33:08.740 --> 00:33:12.700]   And sometimes, we don't even know it, but subconsciously, we might say stuff like that.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:15.500]   Like, "I'm gonna make them feel the burn of what they did to me."
[00:33:15.500 --> 00:33:17.940]   Next thing you know, they come talk to you, and you're like, "What do you want?"
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:18.940]   Whoa, right?
[00:33:18.940 --> 00:33:23.060]   Your attitude comes out and your words are sharp.
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:24.460]   Sometimes you might even slander.
[00:33:24.460 --> 00:33:28.860]   "Oh, oh, that person, you can invest all your life into them, and they don't care."
[00:33:28.860 --> 00:33:31.980]   Whoa, really?
[00:33:31.980 --> 00:33:35.180]   Now you raised it to that person will never care about you?
[00:33:35.180 --> 00:33:37.500]   This kind of stuff happens sometimes.
[00:33:37.500 --> 00:33:48.460]   But I do think, I do think that when we come back to this idea of why lying is separated,
[00:33:48.460 --> 00:33:56.140]   is because that is at the heart of a lot of anger, wrath, malice, slander.
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:34:01.540]   In order for you to retain your stubborn ideology, guess what you have to do?
[00:34:01.540 --> 00:34:06.020]   You have to hunker down, double down into your lie.
[00:34:06.020 --> 00:34:10.060]   You are the biggest fraud when you set yourself up as an idol.
[00:34:10.060 --> 00:34:14.580]   You're living the biggest lie when you think you have every right to be angry and mad at
[00:34:14.580 --> 00:34:18.100]   the world, at God, and how horrible everybody else is.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:19.660]   I'm pretty sure you have found this.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:25.140]   If you've ever dealt with an incredibly angry, malicious individual, they have many lies
[00:34:25.140 --> 00:34:28.500]   they've already bought into.
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:33.420]   But that's because that stubborn, stubborn, idolatrous living of, "You should serve me,
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:36.740]   and you should serve me," you have to live in lies.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:38.820]   And you are the biggest lie.
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:40.500]   It's a fraud.
[00:34:40.500 --> 00:34:45.260]   And so Apostle Paul says, "Stop defrauding each other.
[00:34:45.260 --> 00:34:47.340]   Don't cheat each other."
[00:34:47.340 --> 00:34:49.420]   And that's a convicting thing for us, right?
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:55.820]   When we have that kind of mentality, we are literally robbing, robbing what other people
[00:34:55.820 --> 00:34:57.220]   are created to do.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:02.900]   The people around you are created with all rest of creation, including you, to worship
[00:35:02.900 --> 00:35:04.240]   God Almighty.
[00:35:04.240 --> 00:35:09.300]   And the way it should look is like this.
[00:35:09.300 --> 00:35:10.540]   Okay?
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:17.300]   I spent some time on this, so I wanted to make sure I showed it.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:19.180]   That it looks like this.
[00:35:19.180 --> 00:35:27.180]   To place yourself as just one of the many creation of God intended to serve the Lord.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:32.100]   When you operate in that reality, much of the rest of the expressions and much of the
[00:35:32.100 --> 00:35:37.980]   rest of the things that enter into your life are going to actually be in peace.
[00:35:37.980 --> 00:35:39.340]   So let's take a moment to pray.
[00:35:39.340 --> 00:35:47.100]   And as a way of conclusion, I again wanna say, the initial challenge for us was to seek
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.380]   Christ.
[00:35:48.380 --> 00:35:50.540]   To seek the things above.
[00:35:50.540 --> 00:35:55.580]   That absolutely necessitates we put away the things that are incompatible with Christ,
[00:35:55.580 --> 00:35:57.860]   which is our idolatry.
[00:35:57.860 --> 00:36:00.860]   Let's pray.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:04.100]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:36:04.100 --> 00:36:09.880]   God, we recognize that you are so patient.
[00:36:09.880 --> 00:36:16.460]   As God Almighty, to see little creatures set themselves up as having little invisible thrones,
[00:36:16.460 --> 00:36:19.420]   it must be laughable.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:24.380]   And God, we recognize it must be sometimes so irritating.
[00:36:24.380 --> 00:36:29.320]   And we understand why your word says that you stand opposed to the proud.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:34.420]   I pray, Father God, that you would instill in our hearts humility to recognize, God,
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:36.640]   we are created for you.
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:41.340]   And that if there's anything in our flesh, in our heart, and in our mind that desires
[00:36:41.340 --> 00:36:46.860]   so much to be more important than we really are, I pray, Father God, that you would give
[00:36:46.860 --> 00:36:48.300]   us the heart of surrender.
[00:36:48.300 --> 00:36:51.980]   Lord, we wanna thank you again so much for the word that you have for us today.
[00:36:51.980 --> 00:36:52.980]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:36:52.980 --> 00:36:53.980]   Amen.
