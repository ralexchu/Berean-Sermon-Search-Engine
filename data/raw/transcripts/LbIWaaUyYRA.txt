[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   Good morning, Church family.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   As we begin our service, I'd like to encourage us to reflect on our current lives,
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   our situations, our goals, our desires, our successes,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   and that we would share in Apostle Paul's heart to know
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   that to know Christ would surpass all of them.
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   In Philippians, he writes, "I count all things to be lost in view of the surpassing worth
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   For his sake I have suffered the loss of all things, and count them as rubbish,
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   in order that I may gain Christ and be found in him,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   that I may know him and the power of his resurrection,
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   and may share his sufferings, becoming like him in his death."
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   So this morning I pray that likewise we would see Christ as the most precious treasure
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   and that we would find our full joy and abundant life in him.
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   Sing "Just the Time."
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   [MUSIC]
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   Just the time I think that I'm at peace with the world that's mine.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   I feel at ease, I feel at home, and I know I'm not alone.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   Then in my rest there comes a test that shakes me 'til again I know
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   that what I have is not enough, and again I've got to grow.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:47.000]   Deep within my heart I want to know you.
[00:06:47.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   Lord, I want to know you and I would give my final breath
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:19.000]   The full supply.
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   The full supply I find as I move closer to the heart of God.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   To strengthen me, to nourish me, to fill my mind with it.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   I've truly grown, but even so my hunger hasn't gone away.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   Still I long, still I thirst to know him more each day.
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   Deep within my heart I want to know you.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:35.000]   Lord, I want to know you and I would give my final breath
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   Deep within my heart I want to know you.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   Lord, I want to know you and I would give my final breath
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   to know you in your death and resurrection.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   Lord, I want to know you more.
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Good morning. Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:43.000]   If you are a college student or if you're parents of college students,
[00:09:43.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   after service there is a welcome table that's sitting out there
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and some of the college welcome team and they're going to be stationed out there.
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So they'll give you more information.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   There's a lot of things going on for the college students this week
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   because the students are coming in town.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   I think the school's starting next week.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But if you are here visiting and you want more information about the college ministry,
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:10.000]   please go to that table and they'll give you more information.
[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Okay. I have a few announcements before we get started.
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   First of all, they need volunteers for the trunk formation
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   and this is for replacement of Halloween on September 30th.
[00:10:24.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   So basically you're going to decorate your trunk and then the kids come around,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   your car and the candy and stuff like that will be provided for you.
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   And so they need more cars to volunteer to do that.
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   So if you're willing to do that on that night, please let them know
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   and they'll give you more information about that.
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   Family ministry picnic.
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   There's a picnic going on today at 11 to 3 p.m.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So there's already people there.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   So just grab your lunch. It's just kind of a casual fellowship.
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:54.000]   There's other families that will be there and then you'll be able to just meet with them.
[00:10:54.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   And just, again, there's no specific agenda.
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   So if you're able to make it, it's at Tustin Heritage Park
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   and that's where some of the family members will be going after.
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   FAM 245.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   If you've been married around three years or less, this ministry is for you.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   And this coming Saturday there's a workshop happening in the Sprouts Room upstairs at 10.30 a.m.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Pastor Peter Chung is going to be covering the subject of a worry-free marriage.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   And so if you haven't signed up for that, please sign up for that.
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:28.000]   And then, again, a heads up, the next Sunday we have communion service.
[00:11:28.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   Child safety training is happening next Sunday.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   So if you're working with the youth or children of any kind--
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   not any kind--if you're working with children of that particular kind,
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   there's training that you will need to sit through.
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:48.000]   So please go to that, and that's happening next Sunday.
[00:11:48.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   The next round of membership class--so if you are interested in taking membership,
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   that's taking place starting next Sunday for eight weeks from 9 to 10.20 a.m.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   And that's going to be taking place in our youth group room across the courtyard.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   And then finally on October 7th, there's an all-church cleaning day from 9 to 12 p.m.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   So if you are able--if you're free that morning, please come and help us to organize
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   and clean up the church that we--I think we have this, like, maybe quarterly.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   I think that's it for this morning.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   Let me pray for us.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:23.000]   And, again, if you have physical offering, there's a box on the way out.
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   Let's pray.
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:32.000]   Father, we thank you so much for another day, another privilege that we have
[00:12:32.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   to be able to come and worship you.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:38.000]   Thank you for the fellowship that we have with our brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:12:38.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   We thank you, Father, that you sustain us, that you who began a good work in us,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   that you will be the one who carry it onto completion until the day of Christ.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   Help us, Lord God, to lean on you, to depend on you, to cry out to you,
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   that our lives, Lord, may reflect the tremendous grace that you've given us.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   Help us, Lord, that even in this giving that we would give with a cheerful heart,
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:06.000]   it may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Amen.

[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:46.000]   [music]
[00:54:46.000 --> 00:54:54.000]   See, the rich, the temptation of the rich is that we're not hungry.
[00:54:54.000 --> 00:55:00.000]   We're not hungry. We want Christ, but we don't need Christ.
[00:55:00.000 --> 00:55:05.000]   There's a big difference in the way you worship God when you need him.
[00:55:05.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   There's a big difference in the way that you pray when you need him.
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   There's a big difference in the way you walk with God when you need him.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:22.000]   When you want him, it's like, "Yeah, I want that. I want this, I want that, but I want Jesus too."
[00:55:22.000 --> 00:55:27.000]   There's a huge difference, and it shows. It shows in the way we worship.
[00:55:27.000 --> 00:55:32.000]   It shows in the way we do Bible study. We did it. We just checked off. I was required, and I did it.
[00:55:32.000 --> 00:55:36.000]   But when you need him, when you need him...
[00:55:36.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   Do you remember ever praying because you were so desperate
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   that just casual praying was not enough?
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   Just praying just kind of like casually, it just was not enough.
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:56.000]   You needed God to answer your prayers. You needed him to hear you.
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   And so you cried out to God,
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   "God, I need you to answer this prayer. I am lost without you."
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:14.000]   A prayer of desperation is a prayer that God promised that he would answer
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:19.000]   when we make up our mind. Do you really want that? Do you need that?
[00:56:19.000 --> 00:56:23.000]   Every parent, you know, when a child cries,
[00:56:23.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   when that child cries because it's been a habit of crying,
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   they just want you to be there and put your hand on them or just hold them.
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:39.000]   But you can't run every time they cry because every time they cry and you hold them
[00:56:39.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   and they become a habit and then now you can never rest. You can't get in the car.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   So you learn to distinguish between cry for attention and cry because there's a need.
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:55.000]   That they're desperate. They're choking on something.
[00:56:55.000 --> 00:57:00.000]   They're hurting on something. Something needs my immediate attention.
[00:57:00.000 --> 00:57:05.000]   So he says, "Blessed are those who are hungering and thirsting for righteousness."
[00:57:05.000 --> 00:57:10.000]   Because he recognizes the poverty of his state and he's crying out to God
[00:57:10.000 --> 00:57:15.000]   because only God can answer this prayer. Only God can bring relief.
[00:57:15.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   Amos chapter 6 verse 1, it says, "Woe to those who are yeas in Zion."
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   And the word "yeas" in the NIV, I think it says "complacent."
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:32.000]   "Woe to those who are complacent and to those who feel secure in the mountain of Samaria."
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   The biggest problem that we have in a rich country is complacency.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   Complacency. Yes, we have bad doctrines. We have the health and wealth gospel.
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   We have crazy things that are happening in the church, but the thing that is eroding the church
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:52.000]   more than anything else is complacency.
[00:57:52.000 --> 00:57:58.000]   People who have the right doctrine. People who know the proper gospel.
[00:57:58.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   People who have been walking and in the church, have been cultured in the church, but are complacent.
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:10.000]   We're not in need. Yeah, it'd be great. You never oppose the gospel.
[00:58:10.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   You're never antagonistic toward the gospel. You're just complacent.
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:23.000]   Luke 6, 25, "Woe to you who are well fed, for you shall be hungry."
[00:58:23.000 --> 00:58:27.000]   Have you ever eaten when you're hungry? Like really hungry. I'm not talking about...
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:30.000]   I think most of us don't know what that feels like, right?
[00:58:30.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   I know that right now the intermittent fasting is a big thing, you know, in order to get healthy.
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   But have you ever really eaten when you're hungry and how food tastes?
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:47.000]   I remember back in Korea, you know, back in the 70s, Korea was a third world country.
[00:58:47.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   It was like an abject poverty that all the orphan care and adoption, all this stuff happened in Korea
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:56.000]   because they were so poor after the war.
[00:58:56.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   So even back in the 70s, it was starting to rise, but it wasn't there yet.
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   So I remember we rarely ate meat before we came to the United States.
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:11.000]   And I remember very distinctly whenever we were going to eat, my mom made the announcement.
[00:59:11.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   You know, it'd be February, so you know in March, March 3rd or something,
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:19.000]   we have a guest coming to our house and we're going to have some meat.
[00:59:19.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   So make sure that you're in the house at that time.
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   Believe me, we knew when that was coming, you know, because it wasn't common, right?
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   It was a missionary that would come to town or a special guest.
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:36.000]   And so they would be... and it wasn't like, you know, it wasn't like Korean barbecue like today, right?
[00:59:36.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   It was just like a small plate of meat and you have all this other stuff
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:45.000]   and then everybody would get a little piece, but that was enough to make it a big deal, right?
[00:59:45.000 --> 00:59:48.000]   Because we weren't used to eating meat at that time.
[00:59:48.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   Man, how good that bulgogi tasted, right?
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   You ever eat rice when you haven't eaten for like two to three days?
[00:59:57.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   There was a period when, you know, a few of my friends, we were fasting.
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   At the end of that, we decided to eat and all we had was rice.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:07.000]   But we're so hungry, we'll eat anything.
[01:00:07.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   And I remember eating that rice, I had no idea how good rice was, right?
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   I had no idea how good rice. It is so sweet. It tasted like candy, right?
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:21.000]   If you don't believe me, fast three days, right?
[01:00:21.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   Just so you can prove my illustration.
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:31.000]   When's the last time you hungered and thirsted for God
[01:00:31.000 --> 01:00:36.000]   and then you came to the Word of God and you ate?
[01:00:36.000 --> 01:00:40.000]   Do you remember when you first met Christ?
[01:00:40.000 --> 01:00:45.000]   Tasting the Word of God, fellowship, worship, praise.
[01:00:45.000 --> 01:00:48.000]   Do you remember what that tasted like?
[01:00:48.000 --> 01:00:51.000]   Do you remember what it was like?
[01:00:51.000 --> 01:00:55.000]   And you felt so blessed because you had the privilege to be able to,
[01:00:55.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   "God allows me to do this."
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   But at some point, why did that privilege become an obligation?
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:07.000]   Why did that privilege become a check-off list?
[01:01:07.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   Something that needed to be done.
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:13.000]   That's what he's saying. "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness,
[01:01:13.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   for they shall be satisfied."
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:18.000]   Those who hunger for it. Not just people who are casually coming in.
[01:01:18.000 --> 01:01:21.000]   It's like, "Oh, okay, it's Wednesday. It's time to study."
[01:01:21.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   Those who are hungry and thirsty.
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   You ever have people in your small group or your home group who come in so hungry?
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:31.000]   They don't have to be the most mature Christian.
[01:01:31.000 --> 01:01:35.000]   They don't have to, you know, it's like, "Oh, they're the expert in, you know,
[01:01:35.000 --> 01:01:37.000]   in exposition of the Word."
[01:01:37.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   No, they're just hungry.
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   Brand new Christian. Or maybe they're a Christian,
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   but they're studying the Bible for the first time, and they're like, "Wow.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:48.000]   This is the Word of God."
[01:01:48.000 --> 01:01:50.000]   And they're just eating it up. We hear it all the time.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:54.000]   Because the people in that group are so encouraged.
[01:01:54.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   And all they did was, they brought hunger.
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:03.000]   They didn't exposit. They didn't know the best.
[01:02:03.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   They weren't Christian the longest. They're not the most disciplined.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:11.000]   And all they did was brought in a hungering and thirsting
[01:02:11.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   that they're not used to seeing.
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   And the impact that that makes.
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   It makes other people eating. Right?
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:22.000]   You ever eat something that somebody loves, like ice cream?
[01:02:22.000 --> 01:02:25.000]   You have some friends who love ice cream, and you don't normally like ice cream,
[01:02:25.000 --> 01:02:29.000]   but when they eat ice cream, it makes ice cream taste better.
[01:02:29.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   Right?
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:33.000]   Or maybe they like boba, and, you know, it's like, "I'm not a fan of boba,
[01:02:33.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   but they love it so much that I want to have some."
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   He's talking about people who recognizes his hungering and thirsting for righteousness.
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   And the impact that it has on you, the way it makes the Word of God taste,
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:50.000]   worship, fellowship.
[01:02:50.000 --> 01:02:53.000]   John Piper says in his book, Hunger for God,
[01:02:53.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   "If you don't feel strong desires for the manifestation of the glory of God,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:03:00.000]   it is not because you have drunk deeply and are satisfied.
[01:03:00.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   It is because you have nibbled so long at the table of the world,
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   your soul is stuffed with small things, and there is no room for the great."
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:17.000]   What kills a rich church is cup ramen.
[01:03:17.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   Yeah, cup ramen.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   You have a feast that's waiting for you for dinner,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   and constantly you would like the taste of cup ramen.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:25.000]   Right?
[01:03:25.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   So you're eating cup ramen all day, so when it's time for the banquet,
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:31.000]   you don't have an appetite.
[01:03:31.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   You ever try to eat when you're not hungry?
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:37.000]   It doesn't matter how good the food tastes.
[01:03:37.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   It's torture.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:41.000]   I mean, literally.
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   I've been to a sushi, and, you know, some of the younger guys think that they can eat nonstop.
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   And I remember this one particular guy, some of you guys know who I'm talking about,
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:55.000]   went to eat sushi, and then we were in our second round, and I said, "I am stuffed.
[01:03:55.000 --> 01:03:56.000]   I can't eat anymore."
[01:03:56.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   He said, "No, no, we can eat."
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   And then he ordered a table full of food,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:04.000]   and literally ate two pieces, and we couldn't eat.
[01:04:04.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   So the rest of it we were shoving down our throat
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:09.000]   because we didn't want to be charged another $7.
[01:04:09.000 --> 01:04:13.000]   So him and I were like--you know the Bible says that gluttony is sin,
[01:04:13.000 --> 01:04:15.000]   that we definitely sinned that day.
[01:04:15.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   And we were eating because we were like, "We don't have any appetite.
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:23.000]   We have to shove it in our mouth because we have to get rid of this because we don't want to be charged."
[01:04:23.000 --> 01:04:25.000]   And we ended up doing it.
[01:04:25.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   I literally got up, and if somebody poked me, it would have just all come back up.
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   That's how bad it was, right?
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:36.000]   And I remember there's a video that went viral in our church, Elder James.
[01:04:36.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   We went to eat sushi because it was someone's birthday,
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   and he heard about this story.
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   Some of you guys know who I'm talking about.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   I videotaped him, and I couldn't hear what he was saying,
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:52.000]   but he was so intense--this is kind of a side point, but it's a funny story.
[01:04:52.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   He was intense.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:58.000]   I thought he was exposing the Bible and telling them about the intricacies about the cross.
[01:04:58.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   And I leaned over, and he was saying, "Do not order more than you can eat."
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:08.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:08.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   Did you hear me?
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:13.000]   You, you, you, you, you, you, right?
[01:05:13.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   If we can't finish it, it's going to be--
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:18.000]   "If you order more than what you can eat, we're going to make you eat."
[01:05:18.000 --> 01:05:20.000]   He was--you know how he is, right?
[01:05:20.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   [laughter]
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   That's what eating is like spiritually.
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:33.000]   When you come in full, you're already satisfied.
[01:05:33.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   You already have everything you need, and then you're supposed to go to church because it's Sunday.
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   You don't have to go to Bible study because it's Wednesday.
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   You're eating, but you're force-feeding yourself.
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   You're doing it more because you don't want other people to judge you, out of obligation.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:05:53.000]   But you don't know the taste.
[01:05:53.000 --> 01:06:00.000]   Jesus says, "Come and taste and see how good he is."
[01:06:00.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   In Psalm 63, "Oh God, you are my God. How shall I seek you earnestly?
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:07.000]   I shall seek you earnestly. My soul thirsts for you. My flesh yearns for you."
[01:06:07.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   In a dry and weary land where there is no water,
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:15.000]   if you're a child of God and we're in the kingdom of God,
[01:06:15.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   the only thing that can truly satisfy us is Christ.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:22.000]   Sometimes he will give us poverty, sometimes he will give us wealth,
[01:06:22.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   but every good gift that comes from God is to lead us to him.
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   And anything that distracts us from coming to him is a curse.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   Anything that causes us to come to him is a blessing.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:41.000]   That is the new perspective in the kingdom of God.
[01:06:41.000 --> 01:06:45.000]   In Psalm 42, 1-2, "As the deer pants for the water brooks,
[01:06:45.000 --> 01:06:49.000]   so my soul pants for you, O God. My soul thirsts for God.
[01:06:49.000 --> 01:06:53.000]   For the living God, when shall I come and appear before God?"
[01:06:53.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   I pray that that would be our prayer.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   That we recognize the nibbling of this world that is killing our appetite,
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   that we would prioritize, that we would hunger and thirst for God
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   more than anything else in this world,
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:13.000]   that we would experience what it means to be satisfied in Christ.
[01:07:13.000 --> 01:07:15.000]   Let's pray.
[01:07:15.000 --> 01:07:27.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray that the word that you've implanted in our mind and our hearts, Lord God,
[01:07:27.000 --> 01:07:31.000]   would not return until it has accomplished its purpose.
[01:07:31.000 --> 01:07:36.000]   Help us, Lord, to recognize our true joy.
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:40.000]   Recognize the life that you have come to give and to give abundantly.
[01:07:40.000 --> 01:07:44.000]   That whether we are poor, whether we are hungry,
[01:07:44.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   whether we are rich, whether we are in peace,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   whether we are in turmoil,
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   that every situation in our life would cause us to cry out to you,
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   to desire you, desire Christ more than anything else.
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   Let's sing "As the Dear."
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   As the dear Pantiphor,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   the water soaked my soul longeth after thee.
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   You're my friend.
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:48.000]   You're my friend and you are my brother even though you are a king.
[01:09:48.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   I love you more than any other, so much more than any other.
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:30.000]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:10:30.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Let's sing "I Want You."
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   I want you more than gold or silver.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   Only you can satisfy.
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:02.000]   You alone are the hue,
[01:11:02.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   joined together in the emerald blue.
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:27.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[01:11:27.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   Let's sing "You Alone."
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   You alone are my strength, my shield.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:57.000]   To you alone may my spirit yield.
[01:11:57.000 --> 01:12:09.000]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   "You Alone."
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   You alone are my heart's desire and I long to worship thee.
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:33.000]   Psalm 63, 1.
[01:12:33.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Oh God, you are my God.
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:37.000]   I shall seek you earnestly.
[01:12:37.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   My soul thirsts for you.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   My flesh yearns for you in a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:53.000]   Help us, Lord God, to know that the true water, that the true bread is Christ.
[01:12:53.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   That there will be a stirring in our hearts and hungering and thirsting for Christ more than anything else in our lives.
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   Help us, Lord God, to open our eyes to see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:11.000]   That we would be able to confess as Apostle Paul did,
[01:13:11.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   that in light of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, that all things will become rubbish.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   That we would no longer be tempted by the things of this world, but that we would covet the things from you and you alone.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   Send us wherever you desire that we may be the aroma of Christ, that we may be the light of Christ wherever you send us.
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:44.000]   God sent his Son.
[01:13:44.000 --> 01:13:50.000]   They called him Jesus.
[01:13:50.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   He came to love, heal and forgive.
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   He lived and died to buy my pardon.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:22.000]   An empty grave is there to my Savior lives.
[01:14:22.000 --> 01:14:33.000]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:14:33.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   Because he lives,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   all fear is gone.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:14:55.000 --> 01:15:07.000]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:15:07.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   Because he lives,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   I can face tomorrow.
