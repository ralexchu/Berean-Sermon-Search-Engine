[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [Music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:18.000]   Jesus, Lord of Heaven, I do not deserve
[00:00:18.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   The grace that You have given
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Or the promise of Your Word
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Lord, I stand in wonder
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   At the sacrifice You've made
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   With mercy beyond measure
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   My high debt You freely pay
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   And Your love is deeper
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:04.000]   Than any ocean higher
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Than the heavens reaching
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   Beyond the stars in the sky
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Jesus, Your love has no bounds
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   Jesus, Your love has no bounds
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Jesus, Lord of Heaven, I do not deserve
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   The grace that You have given
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   Or the promise of Your Word
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   Lord, I stand in wonder
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   At the sacrifice You've made
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   With mercy beyond measure
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   My high debt You freely pay
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   And Your love is deeper
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Than any ocean higher
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   Than the heavens reaching
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   Beyond the stars in the sky
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   Your love is deeper
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   Than any ocean higher
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   Than the heavens reaching
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Beyond the stars in the sky
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   Jesus, Your love has no bounds
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Jesus, Your love has no bounds
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:20.000]   Hi, good morning. Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   We're going to get started. We have an announcement from our family ministry
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   about our Christmas events that are going on.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   So Dean's going to come up and he's going to give the announcements.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   Hi, good morning, everyone. I'm Dean Shin.
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   I'm part of the family ministry logistics team.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   So this year for the family ministry for Christmas,
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:43.000]   rather than having a large gathering,
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:46.000]   what we will do, you know, with the church getting bigger and whatnot,
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   is have smaller, cozier, more intimate gatherings.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   So it will be at individual people's homes.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   Okay, so this is kind of going to be ongoing.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   So as you sign up, you'll be asked if you are willing to open up your home
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   both to host and to facilitate.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   So we are asking if you live in Irvine or Tustin or kind of closer to church,
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   if you would pray about it and see if you are willing to open up your home.
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   That way people can sort of come in and maybe don't have to travel as far of a distance.
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   If you do have to travel a little bit, hopefully you'll be okay with that.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   But, you know, people are often asking, like, how can I serve?
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   How can I be involved?
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   So this is really a great way for you to serve the church and show hospitality.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And in Exodus 36, there's a time when Moses is gathering things for the tabernacle,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and he has to actually stop the people.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   He has to refrain--he has to restrain them because they're giving so much, right?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   So my prayer and hope is that so many of you will be moved to open up your homes,
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   that we'll have too many homes, and we'll say, "Thank you for your heart.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   God sees it, but we don't need your home this time around."
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   If you have any questions about it, please let me know.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   My email is in the announcement, right?
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   It's my name, D-E-A-N-S-Y-N@gmail.com.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   You can find me on Facebook.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   I'm one of maybe two people with that name on Facebook, so really easy to find.
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   And Family Ministry Logistics will help you, you know, with suggestions and guidance and whatnot
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   if you want to host, okay, so you're not going to be left totally on your own.
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:20.000]   But at the same time, we do ask you to sort of take the ball and run with it.
[00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   Think of it as if you would prepare a gathering for your own, you know, biological family,
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   but this is for your spiritual family, okay?
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   So again, if you have any questions, please let me know.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   Okay, thank you.
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   [applause]
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   Okay, just a reminder again, if you signed up for the evangelism outing that's taking place
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:46.000]   this coming Saturday from 1 to 2, and if you still desire to participate,
[00:05:46.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   please let the proper people know.
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Again, sign up and all this stuff will be on the Facebook and our church app.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   And also the Bible Study Lab starting next Sunday,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.000]   Pastor Mark is leading a Bible Study Lab that will kind of help you through how to do
[00:05:59.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   inductive Bible study, which is what's going on during Wednesday in the home groups.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And so if you want to sign up for that, the first session is starting next Sunday at 2 p.m.
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   And then again, the holiday outreaches that are taking place that our Sisters Ministry is leading,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   again, if you go outside, you'll see all the booths there.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   So if you haven't visited there, you want to find out what's going on,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   they'll give you all the information.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:24.000]   And if you want to participate in that, you can sign up at those tables after the service.
[00:06:24.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   And then next Sunday we have Orphan Sunday.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   We're going to have a guest speaker that's going to come, and he has, again,
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   personal knowledge of foster caring and then adoption through that and all the ups and downs.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   And obviously it is Orphan Sunday all throughout the country,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   and so we wanted to take that opportunity to kind of inform the church, inspire the church,
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   encourage the church to consider adopting going forward.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:52.000]   And then there's various other ministries that will be coming to set up booths outside
[00:06:52.000 --> 00:06:54.000]   during the first and the second service.
[00:06:54.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   So if you're at the first service, the booths will also be there,
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   and so we have various things that are planned to do that.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   But as I mentioned, we are going to be taking special offering for that,
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   and so this is for families who are planning to adopt in the future,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:10.000]   and this will be a scholarship for them.
[00:07:10.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   So after they adopt, we will assist some to be able to assist some of the people.
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   And again, this is to encourage the families to consider that
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   if that's something that the Lord lays on your heart.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So again, next week when we do have offering, we ask you to just prepare
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   and make sure that in your offering that you designate separately from your regular offering
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   so that our accounting people who are doing accounting will be able to separate that
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   and then lay that aside for future adoption purposes.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   Today, as you guys know, we have trunk formation.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.000]   Today is Reformation Sunday for us as Christians,
[00:07:43.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   and so after service, I don't think anybody usually parks on this side,
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   but if you do happen to have a car out here, we need to get that moved,
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   and then all the stuff are going to be set up out here.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   And then if you do happen to come to church for whatever reason,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:00.000]   please do not park in this area.
[00:08:00.000 --> 00:08:04.000]   And then they're going to try to start sharply at 4 o'clock,
[00:08:04.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   so try to come maybe a little bit before that so that you'll be ready to go
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:12.000]   when 4 o'clock starts, and then it'll be done by 6 o'clock.
[00:08:12.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   So if you're setting up your car, the trunk formation, and all this stuff,
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   the church will be open after the second service,
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and as soon as the people are gone from this,
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   you can just start setting up your trunk formation.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   All right, let me pray for us for the offering,
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:31.000]   and then for those of you who are new to the church,
[00:08:31.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   we have a physical offering box in the back,
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   and it looks like a little birdhouse, and it'll say "Offering Box."
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:40.000]   So after the service, you can go there and drop off your physical offering,
[00:08:40.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   and for the rest of us, we'll give you a minute to give the electronic offering.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the blessing that we have
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   to be able to call you our Abba Father.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   Lord, no matter what distractions that we may have brought into this room,
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   I pray that our singing, your word, even in our giving, Lord God,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   may it be an act of worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   We ask, Lord, that you would bless this time.
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   Help us, Lord God, to lift up our eyes,
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:18.000]   to know where our hope and help truly comes from.
[00:09:18.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   May the offering that we give you this time be multiplied,
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your glory.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:28.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   [piano music]
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   [piano music]

[00:10:10.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   [piano music]
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   All right, as we continue our worship,
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   just a quick reminder for those sitting outside in the courtyard,
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   would you please just remain seated during worship,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   as it's helpful for everyone to see the screen.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   And as for those in here, would you please stand for worship?
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   [upbeat music]

[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:30.520]   - Reading out of the NASB.
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:31.700]   Remember those who led you,
[00:20:31.700 --> 00:20:33.320]   who spoke the word of God to you,
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:35.120]   and considering the result of their conduct,
[00:20:35.120 --> 00:20:36.880]   imitate their faith.
[00:20:36.880 --> 00:20:40.600]   Jesus Christ is the same yesterday and today and forever.
[00:20:40.600 --> 00:20:43.000]   Do not be carried away by varied and strange teachings,
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:45.560]   for it is good for the heart to be strengthened by grace,
[00:20:45.560 --> 00:20:48.720]   not by foods, through which those who were so occupied
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:50.520]   were not benefited.
[00:20:50.520 --> 00:20:54.640]   Let's pray.
[00:20:54.640 --> 00:20:57.280]   Heavenly Father, we lift up this time to you,
[00:20:57.280 --> 00:20:58.760]   asking you to anoint it, Lord God,
[00:20:58.760 --> 00:21:01.200]   by your word and your spirit.
[00:21:01.200 --> 00:21:04.560]   Cause us, Lord, to have a greater vision of who you are,
[00:21:04.560 --> 00:21:07.800]   that your glory, Lord, would shine,
[00:21:07.800 --> 00:21:09.200]   that we would be sanctified
[00:21:09.200 --> 00:21:12.920]   the more we understand who you are and who your son is,
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:14.800]   and by your spirit, that you would grip our hearts,
[00:21:14.800 --> 00:21:18.080]   our lives, our thoughts, our emotions, our will.
[00:21:18.080 --> 00:21:20.440]   May it all be surrendered to you for the sake of your name.
[00:21:20.440 --> 00:21:23.440]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:21:23.440 --> 00:21:26.440]   Amen.
[00:21:26.440 --> 00:21:30.760]   Today is, again, the last day of October.
[00:21:30.760 --> 00:21:31.720]   We're getting into November,
[00:21:31.720 --> 00:21:33.120]   and around this time of the year,
[00:21:33.120 --> 00:21:35.400]   we do a lot of evaluations of what's going on
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:37.800]   and what are some things that need to be improved
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.920]   and changed next year.
[00:21:39.920 --> 00:21:42.280]   And so even, not just in church,
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:44.160]   but I'm sure every one of us,
[00:21:44.160 --> 00:21:47.280]   when the year kind of starts to wrap down
[00:21:47.280 --> 00:21:49.880]   or wind down and then next year comes around,
[00:21:49.880 --> 00:21:52.760]   what are some things that we want to change?
[00:21:52.760 --> 00:21:55.600]   All right, so maybe we want to be in better health.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.800]   So this is the time of the year
[00:21:56.800 --> 00:21:58.080]   where you start to make plans,
[00:21:58.080 --> 00:22:00.600]   and possibly at the beginning of next year,
[00:22:00.600 --> 00:22:02.400]   you get gym membership,
[00:22:02.400 --> 00:22:04.440]   and then you say, "We're gonna do this,"
[00:22:04.440 --> 00:22:07.040]   at least for a few weeks, right?
[00:22:07.040 --> 00:22:08.560]   At least we're determined we're gonna do this.
[00:22:08.560 --> 00:22:11.360]   Or maybe you're considering a job change,
[00:22:11.360 --> 00:22:13.000]   and you want improvement in that.
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.240]   Maybe certain relationships that you're trying to work on.
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:17.680]   Obviously, with the pandemic
[00:22:17.680 --> 00:22:20.360]   and with the various things that's been going on,
[00:22:20.360 --> 00:22:22.560]   we're hoping that next year things will,
[00:22:22.560 --> 00:22:24.320]   whatever normal is,
[00:22:24.320 --> 00:22:25.680]   that we would be able to go back
[00:22:25.680 --> 00:22:29.200]   to some semblance of what we were able to do.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:31.640]   We're eagerly waiting for India to open up
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.240]   so that we can go and visit them,
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:34.680]   'cause we have stuff that we want to take,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.560]   and we haven't seen our pastors there in a couple years,
[00:22:37.560 --> 00:22:40.000]   so we're hoping that things will change
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:42.840]   and that the country will be able to open to do that.
[00:22:42.840 --> 00:22:46.360]   So as much as we look forward to some changes,
[00:22:46.360 --> 00:22:50.920]   there are some things that we really hope doesn't change.
[00:22:50.920 --> 00:22:52.640]   And some of the things that we don't want change
[00:22:52.640 --> 00:22:56.680]   are things that probably that we value the most, right?
[00:22:56.680 --> 00:22:59.440]   Maybe our families, right?
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:00.920]   Certain things that we value,
[00:23:00.920 --> 00:23:04.120]   and we're hoping that it will continue
[00:23:04.120 --> 00:23:06.520]   from the past to present and the future.
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:11.120]   But the reality is there's nothing that doesn't change
[00:23:11.120 --> 00:23:14.200]   from human experience.
[00:23:14.200 --> 00:23:15.720]   Relationships change.
[00:23:15.720 --> 00:23:17.720]   We change, right?
[00:23:17.720 --> 00:23:20.680]   I think we're playing the basketball and BBA
[00:23:20.680 --> 00:23:23.480]   and the legends, and a lot of us,
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:25.000]   our favorite word is used to.
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.240]   I used to do this, I used to do that.
[00:23:28.240 --> 00:23:29.200]   Not that it was just me.
[00:23:29.200 --> 00:23:32.240]   I mean, we got a room full of people used to people, right?
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:33.120]   So things have changed.
[00:23:33.120 --> 00:23:35.440]   Things are continuing to change.
[00:23:35.440 --> 00:23:38.000]   But things that really matter,
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:41.800]   we hope and desire that it would not change.
[00:23:41.800 --> 00:23:44.200]   Because when we anchor ourselves
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:45.720]   to things that are important to us,
[00:23:45.720 --> 00:23:49.200]   we're anchoring to things that we're hoping won't change.
[00:23:49.200 --> 00:23:51.840]   I mean, the whole book of Hebrews,
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:53.920]   the theme is to be anchored in Christ
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:56.000]   so that we do not drift.
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:23:58.120]   No matter what happens, no matter what trials,
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:23:59.320]   no matter what relationship,
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:01.520]   no matter what hardship may come,
[00:24:01.520 --> 00:24:05.520]   no matter what government, no matter what leadership,
[00:24:05.520 --> 00:24:08.600]   that our anchoring is not in the circumstance
[00:24:08.600 --> 00:24:10.720]   or the people that are around us, but in Christ.
[00:24:10.720 --> 00:24:12.800]   And that's why he says today,
[00:24:12.800 --> 00:24:15.960]   to not to drift and to be anchored in Christ
[00:24:15.960 --> 00:24:20.360]   who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:24:20.360 --> 00:24:23.000]   Last week, we talked about in verse seven,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:25.360]   how he says, "In order for us not to this,
[00:24:25.360 --> 00:24:26.920]   "remember those who led you,
[00:24:26.920 --> 00:24:28.200]   "who spoke the word of God to you
[00:24:28.200 --> 00:24:30.000]   "and considering the result of their conduct,
[00:24:30.000 --> 00:24:32.360]   "imitate their faith.
[00:24:32.360 --> 00:24:34.840]   "These are people who have gone before them
[00:24:34.840 --> 00:24:38.400]   "who may have been persecuted and possibly put to death.
[00:24:38.400 --> 00:24:40.960]   "And as a result of that, they were afraid,
[00:24:40.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   "they were concerned."
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:45.040]   And so he's reminding them, but consider carefully,
[00:24:45.040 --> 00:24:46.360]   these people who spoke the word of God to you,
[00:24:46.360 --> 00:24:47.920]   the end result of their life,
[00:24:47.920 --> 00:24:50.600]   how it brought glory to God and strengthened the church
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:52.840]   and spread the gospel, imitate their faith.
[00:24:52.840 --> 00:24:56.000]   And then how seven and eight is connected
[00:24:56.000 --> 00:24:59.840]   is the motivation behind
[00:24:59.840 --> 00:25:01.800]   why they were able to persevere to the end
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:05.320]   is because they were anchored to Christ
[00:25:05.320 --> 00:25:08.480]   who was the same yesterday, today, and forevermore.
[00:25:08.480 --> 00:25:13.640]   And so he's telling them to not to drift.
[00:25:13.640 --> 00:25:15.800]   In fact, that's the main point that he was trying to make
[00:25:15.800 --> 00:25:18.080]   in Hebrews chapter 10, 32 to 36,
[00:25:18.080 --> 00:25:20.880]   describing how they were in the past.
[00:25:20.880 --> 00:25:23.640]   Remember the former days when after being enlightened,
[00:25:23.640 --> 00:25:26.480]   you endured a great conflict of suffering,
[00:25:26.480 --> 00:25:28.280]   partly by being made a public spectacle
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:29.880]   through reproaches and tribulation,
[00:25:29.880 --> 00:25:32.000]   and partly by becoming the sharers
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:34.440]   with those who were so treated.
[00:25:34.440 --> 00:25:36.120]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners,
[00:25:36.120 --> 00:25:37.960]   accepted joyfully the seizure of your property,
[00:25:37.960 --> 00:25:39.640]   knowing that you have for yourselves
[00:25:39.640 --> 00:25:42.280]   a better possession and a lasting one.
[00:25:42.280 --> 00:25:45.760]   Now, if they were anchored and they stayed there,
[00:25:45.760 --> 00:25:47.960]   this would have been a model church.
[00:25:47.960 --> 00:25:51.000]   But the reason why the whole book of,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:52.440]   whole letter of Hebrews is written
[00:25:52.440 --> 00:25:54.840]   is because they didn't stay there.
[00:25:54.840 --> 00:25:58.120]   They started drifting back into their old way of life.
[00:25:58.120 --> 00:26:00.880]   They started trying to compromise with old Judaism,
[00:26:00.880 --> 00:26:03.080]   with the new faith in Christ.
[00:26:03.080 --> 00:26:04.400]   And so they started drifting.
[00:26:04.400 --> 00:26:06.920]   So he's reminding them, remember,
[00:26:06.920 --> 00:26:07.840]   remember how you used to,
[00:26:07.840 --> 00:26:09.560]   remember when you first accepted Christ
[00:26:09.560 --> 00:26:11.880]   and you were willing to suffer for Christ.
[00:26:11.880 --> 00:26:13.640]   You fellowship with those who were in prison.
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:17.200]   You joyfully accepted the confiscation of your property
[00:26:17.200 --> 00:26:19.120]   in the midst of intense persecution.
[00:26:19.120 --> 00:26:19.960]   Remember that.
[00:26:19.960 --> 00:26:22.040]   And the reason why he's telling them to remember that
[00:26:22.040 --> 00:26:25.280]   is so that they can remember and continue.
[00:26:25.280 --> 00:26:30.600]   And that's exactly what he says in Revelation 2, verse five,
[00:26:30.600 --> 00:26:33.900]   when the letter is written to the church of Ephesus.
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:37.960]   He says, you've drifted from your first love, right?
[00:26:37.960 --> 00:26:39.480]   And he says, you need to restore that
[00:26:39.480 --> 00:26:41.480]   'cause if you don't restore that,
[00:26:41.480 --> 00:26:43.840]   Jesus says he's gonna take away the lamp stand.
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:46.200]   And the remedy for that, he says,
[00:26:46.200 --> 00:26:49.000]   remember from where you have fallen and repent
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.820]   and do the deeds you did at first.
[00:26:52.820 --> 00:26:54.280]   Remember.
[00:26:54.280 --> 00:26:56.640]   So the whole text that we're looking at here,
[00:26:56.640 --> 00:27:00.700]   as the author is summarizing and concluding
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:02.240]   the whole purpose of this text,
[00:27:02.240 --> 00:27:06.540]   he's trying to, again, wrap it up in a nice package
[00:27:06.540 --> 00:27:07.760]   to not to drift.
[00:27:07.760 --> 00:27:09.800]   Look at the people who've gone ahead of us.
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:12.280]   And the reason why they were able to persevere
[00:27:12.280 --> 00:27:15.040]   in their faith is because they anchored themselves in Christ.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.360]   So the whole point that he's trying to make
[00:27:16.360 --> 00:27:20.040]   is you ought to also anchor yourself in Christ.
[00:27:20.040 --> 00:27:22.760]   In fact, that's exactly what he says
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:24.960]   in Hebrews chapter one, 10 through 12.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:27.560]   From the very get-go, this was his point.
[00:27:27.560 --> 00:27:29.880]   You, Lord, in the beginning,
[00:27:29.880 --> 00:27:31.040]   lay the foundation of the earth
[00:27:31.040 --> 00:27:32.700]   and the heavens are the works of your hands.
[00:27:32.700 --> 00:27:35.200]   They will perish, but you will remain.
[00:27:35.200 --> 00:27:38.760]   You see, all of creation, everything that tempts us,
[00:27:38.760 --> 00:27:40.480]   everything that entangles us,
[00:27:40.480 --> 00:27:45.480]   you created, but all of that eventually will perish,
[00:27:45.480 --> 00:27:47.020]   but you will remain.
[00:27:47.020 --> 00:27:50.440]   They all will become old like a garment
[00:27:50.440 --> 00:27:53.020]   and like a mantle, you will roll them up like a garment.
[00:27:53.020 --> 00:27:55.320]   They will also be changed, but you are the same
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.820]   and your years will not come to an end.
[00:27:58.820 --> 00:28:01.400]   So he started with this.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:03.320]   He started by reminding us
[00:28:03.320 --> 00:28:05.520]   the reason why we need to anchor ourselves in Christ
[00:28:05.520 --> 00:28:08.880]   is because everything that we pursue,
[00:28:08.880 --> 00:28:11.220]   everything that we're tempted by,
[00:28:11.220 --> 00:28:12.680]   all of it is going to pass away,
[00:28:12.680 --> 00:28:15.080]   but only Christ will remain the same.
[00:28:15.080 --> 00:28:17.820]   And now as he is concluding this letter,
[00:28:17.820 --> 00:28:21.360]   he's reminding us everything I told you,
[00:28:21.360 --> 00:28:22.860]   why we need to anchor with him,
[00:28:22.860 --> 00:28:25.640]   and now the only thing that's gonna sustain you
[00:28:25.640 --> 00:28:27.200]   past, present, and future
[00:28:27.200 --> 00:28:31.160]   is the one who remains the same past, present, and future.
[00:28:31.160 --> 00:28:34.280]   This statement here in verse eight
[00:28:34.280 --> 00:28:36.760]   is not just a casual statement.
[00:28:36.760 --> 00:28:38.440]   Only God can make this statement.
[00:28:38.440 --> 00:28:40.840]   In fact, all throughout the Old Testament,
[00:28:40.840 --> 00:28:45.480]   God is described as having an immutable character,
[00:28:45.480 --> 00:28:47.800]   that every part of who he is is immutable.
[00:28:47.800 --> 00:28:49.720]   Only God can claim this.
[00:28:49.720 --> 00:28:55.120]   Only God himself can claim to never change.
[00:28:55.120 --> 00:28:56.680]   So this morning what I wanna do
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:28:58.760]   is I wanna describe four things
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:01.000]   that are connected to immutability.
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.480]   In order for this to be true of an individual,
[00:29:04.480 --> 00:29:06.160]   there needs to be four other characters
[00:29:06.160 --> 00:29:08.080]   that exist in that being
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:10.000]   in order for them to be immutable.
[00:29:10.000 --> 00:29:11.920]   And then at the conclusion,
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:13.800]   I wanna connect the dots for us at the end,
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:15.120]   why this is so important,
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:16.760]   why he's saying what he is saying.
[00:29:16.760 --> 00:29:19.080]   'Cause he's talking to a bunch of people
[00:29:19.080 --> 00:29:21.200]   who are fatigued, who are tired,
[00:29:21.200 --> 00:29:24.000]   maybe some of them compromised, ready to quit,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:24.840]   and then he says,
[00:29:24.840 --> 00:29:28.080]   "But God is the same yesterday, today, and forever."
[00:29:28.080 --> 00:29:30.200]   If you see that in isolation and context,
[00:29:30.200 --> 00:29:32.000]   how does that give you strength to persevere?
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:33.320]   God's the same.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:37.640]   Man, I'm struggling, I'm tempted, I'm about to quit.
[00:29:37.640 --> 00:29:40.360]   Jesus is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:41.920]   If you don't understand the context
[00:29:41.920 --> 00:29:43.120]   and the application of that,
[00:29:43.120 --> 00:29:45.160]   it just sounds like theology.
[00:29:45.160 --> 00:29:46.920]   So what I wanna do is I wanna present to you
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:48.960]   why this is important,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:53.020]   why this is a description of only God,
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.160]   and then how that directly applies to our perseverance.
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:29:59.240]   Okay, so one, Jesus is immutable.
[00:29:59.240 --> 00:30:00.960]   In order for Jesus to be immutable,
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:03.620]   he needs to be completely independent.
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.000]   There's what the theologians called
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   the doctrine of aseity,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:13.000]   where in John 8, 55, Jesus says of himself,
[00:30:13.000 --> 00:30:17.840]   "Truly, truly, I say to you, before Abraham was born, I am."
[00:30:17.840 --> 00:30:20.760]   And that is a direct quote that he's making,
[00:30:20.760 --> 00:30:24.240]   saying that that same God who introduced himself
[00:30:24.240 --> 00:30:27.980]   to Moses and Israel in Exodus chapter three,
[00:30:27.980 --> 00:30:31.640]   Jesus is claiming that title for himself.
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:32.480]   I am.
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:35.080]   In Exodus 3, 13 or 14, it says,
[00:30:35.080 --> 00:30:35.920]   "Then Moses said to God,
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:38.320]   'Behold, I am going to the sons of Israel,
[00:30:38.320 --> 00:30:39.160]   and I will say to them,
[00:30:39.160 --> 00:30:41.080]   'The God of your fathers has sent me to you.
[00:30:41.080 --> 00:30:44.560]   Now they may say to me, 'What is his name?
[00:30:44.560 --> 00:30:45.680]   What shall I say to them?'
[00:30:45.680 --> 00:30:49.120]   God said to Moses, 'I am who I am.'
[00:30:49.120 --> 00:30:51.160]   And he says, 'Thus you shall say to the sons of Israel,
[00:30:51.160 --> 00:30:53.360]   'I am has sent me to you.'"
[00:30:53.360 --> 00:30:54.640]   I am.
[00:30:54.640 --> 00:30:56.960]   What does that even mean, I am?
[00:30:56.960 --> 00:30:57.800]   Right?
[00:30:57.800 --> 00:30:58.980]   So I don't know how many of you grew up
[00:30:58.980 --> 00:31:00.380]   watching Popeye the Sailor Man,
[00:31:00.380 --> 00:31:02.380]   that's what he used to say.
[00:31:02.380 --> 00:31:05.340]   I am who I am, and that is all that I am.
[00:31:05.340 --> 00:31:07.740]   I didn't realize how blasphemous that was.
[00:31:07.740 --> 00:31:08.780]   (congregation laughing)
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:11.940]   Because that's a title that God used for himself.
[00:31:11.940 --> 00:31:13.980]   I am who I am.
[00:31:13.980 --> 00:31:17.220]   And the meaning behind that, that he is self-sufficient.
[00:31:17.220 --> 00:31:21.300]   He's the only being who is completely independent
[00:31:21.300 --> 00:31:22.340]   of everything else.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:24.980]   If you've taken any philosophy class,
[00:31:24.980 --> 00:31:26.420]   you know one of the main arguments
[00:31:26.420 --> 00:31:29.060]   is everything has cause and effect.
[00:31:29.060 --> 00:31:30.740]   When you see a certain effect,
[00:31:30.740 --> 00:31:32.940]   you say, "Well, what caused that?"
[00:31:32.940 --> 00:31:34.660]   If you see certain things happening in history,
[00:31:34.660 --> 00:31:35.580]   "Well, what caused that?
[00:31:35.580 --> 00:31:36.820]   Why is this happening?"
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.940]   And you usually kind of try to connect the dots.
[00:31:38.940 --> 00:31:43.940]   What was the cause that created this effect?
[00:31:43.940 --> 00:31:49.140]   Well, Bible tells us that God is the ultimate cause.
[00:31:49.140 --> 00:31:53.180]   That he himself is independent of any change
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:56.700]   because he is not dependent on anything.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:32:00.860]   I mean, think about who we are, right?
[00:32:00.860 --> 00:32:03.580]   I mean, you meet friends that you met from 10 years ago,
[00:32:03.580 --> 00:32:05.060]   and they look similar.
[00:32:05.060 --> 00:32:06.340]   I mean, obviously, they get gray hair,
[00:32:06.340 --> 00:32:08.220]   and they look a little bit different.
[00:32:08.220 --> 00:32:09.780]   But you meet them, it's like there are certain things
[00:32:09.780 --> 00:32:13.740]   that are similar, but people go through change all the time.
[00:32:13.740 --> 00:32:14.660]   We're never the same.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.980]   10 years ago, last year, we're constantly changing.
[00:32:17.980 --> 00:32:21.380]   I was thinking about my own life, how I shared with you.
[00:32:21.380 --> 00:32:25.140]   I was born in Korea, and I was thinking,
[00:32:25.140 --> 00:32:28.580]   my life now, who I am, is completely different
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:30.700]   than what I remember from my childhood
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:34.220]   because I was given a Korean name,
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:36.380]   and Korea was a third-world country at that time,
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:40.180]   and almost everybody went to the bathroom in the outhouse.
[00:32:40.180 --> 00:32:41.380]   Every once in a while, we would travel
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:42.880]   and go to certain parts of the world
[00:32:42.880 --> 00:32:43.720]   where they use the outhouse.
[00:32:43.720 --> 00:32:46.300]   It's like, "Oh, we're so uncomfortable."
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.540]   But that's what our life was like when we were young.
[00:32:49.540 --> 00:32:52.580]   Didn't speak English till I was about seven or eight years old.
[00:32:52.580 --> 00:32:55.820]   Even our name was given to us by a pastor.
[00:32:55.820 --> 00:33:00.100]   And I think they gave my older brother, Paul,
[00:33:00.100 --> 00:33:02.700]   because he's the leader, he's the oldest,
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:04.540]   and then he gave Philip his name
[00:33:04.540 --> 00:33:08.300]   because he's the youngest one, right?
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:09.380]   And I think he named me Peter
[00:33:09.380 --> 00:33:13.020]   because I look like a troublemaker, right?
[00:33:13.020 --> 00:33:14.660]   A lot of action.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:19.520]   And so, even my name was given to me later on in life.
[00:33:19.520 --> 00:33:21.180]   But every once in a while, I think,
[00:33:21.180 --> 00:33:22.340]   "What would I have been like
[00:33:22.340 --> 00:33:24.780]   "if I never came to the United States?"
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:27.460]   I would have been a completely different person.
[00:33:27.460 --> 00:33:30.660]   Every different stage of our life, something happens.
[00:33:30.660 --> 00:33:33.360]   Maybe something good happens, something bad happens.
[00:33:33.360 --> 00:33:36.780]   Kind of career you choose.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:39.060]   Where you go to school.
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.180]   Kind of friends you hang out with.
[00:33:41.180 --> 00:33:42.460]   What church you go to.
[00:33:42.460 --> 00:33:45.540]   All of these things affect the way we are,
[00:33:45.540 --> 00:33:48.380]   how we think and how we respond to things.
[00:33:48.380 --> 00:33:51.160]   So every single one of us, our circumstance,
[00:33:51.160 --> 00:33:53.620]   our experience, our relationships,
[00:33:53.620 --> 00:33:56.840]   all of it affects who we are.
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:00.560]   Every once in a while, somebody who hears me online
[00:34:00.560 --> 00:34:03.560]   and have never met me, they say, "Hey, you have an accent."
[00:34:03.560 --> 00:34:07.320]   I don't know if you hear it, but I've heard that enough.
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:09.160]   And they said, "It's kind of fobby."
[00:34:09.160 --> 00:34:13.000]   Kind of fobby, but it's not quite fobby.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:16.640]   I kind of hear a little bit of New Jersey.
[00:34:16.640 --> 00:34:17.560]   (audience laughing)
[00:34:17.560 --> 00:34:19.840]   A little bit of the South and Midwest.
[00:34:19.840 --> 00:34:22.200]   And they can't quite figure it out,
[00:34:22.200 --> 00:34:25.520]   but it's not normal, basically, that's what they mean.
[00:34:25.520 --> 00:34:29.320]   That's because we lived in the East Coast at one point.
[00:34:29.320 --> 00:34:32.560]   And then my parents moved to the Midwest at one point.
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:35.260]   And then we lived in the South for a period.
[00:34:35.260 --> 00:34:36.700]   Then went back to Korea and came back,
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.020]   so our family was nomadic.
[00:34:39.020 --> 00:34:40.540]   So I think each one of those places,
[00:34:40.540 --> 00:34:42.280]   I picked up a little bit of accent.
[00:34:42.280 --> 00:34:44.680]   So I don't even know what it is,
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:46.520]   but they said people who hear me online saying,
[00:34:46.520 --> 00:34:50.040]   "You have something, I just can't make it out."
[00:34:50.040 --> 00:34:52.560]   So even I don't know, but my circumstances
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:55.280]   had affected even my speech, right?
[00:34:55.280 --> 00:34:57.120]   Even the way maybe I say things.
[00:34:57.120 --> 00:35:02.120]   Every single one of us is affected by our circumstance.
[00:35:02.120 --> 00:35:05.400]   And that's part of the reason why we are always changing.
[00:35:05.400 --> 00:35:11.200]   In order for a being to be immutable,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.520]   he cannot be affected by his circumstance.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:17.480]   God is the ultimate cause.
[00:35:17.480 --> 00:35:20.400]   He's completely independent.
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:24.240]   And that's what he means when he says, "I am who I am."
[00:35:24.240 --> 00:35:27.680]   Not I will be, not I was, but I am.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:32.020]   Secondly, Jesus is immutable because he is perfect.
[00:35:32.020 --> 00:35:35.620]   In order for something to remain the same,
[00:35:35.620 --> 00:35:39.480]   there needs to be continuation, right?
[00:35:39.480 --> 00:35:40.740]   He needs to be perfect.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.200]   In Numbers 23, 19, he says, "God is not man,
[00:35:43.200 --> 00:35:44.980]   "that he should lie, nor the Son of Man,
[00:35:44.980 --> 00:35:46.120]   "that he should repent."
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:47.920]   In other words, to change.
[00:35:47.920 --> 00:35:49.800]   "Has he said, and will he not do it?
[00:35:49.800 --> 00:35:52.680]   "Or has he spoken, and will he not make it good?"
[00:35:52.680 --> 00:35:56.400]   God is immutable because he never makes judgment
[00:35:56.400 --> 00:35:57.400]   that is wrong.
[00:35:57.400 --> 00:35:59.500]   He is perfect.
[00:35:59.500 --> 00:36:02.380]   James 1, 17, it says, "Every good thing given,
[00:36:02.380 --> 00:36:04.320]   "and every perfect gift is from above,
[00:36:04.320 --> 00:36:06.120]   "coming down from the Father of lights,
[00:36:06.120 --> 00:36:10.020]   "with whom there is no variation or shifting shadow."
[00:36:10.020 --> 00:36:12.600]   God, in his very nature,
[00:36:12.600 --> 00:36:14.520]   in order for somebody to be immutable,
[00:36:14.520 --> 00:36:17.660]   there has to be perfection in him already.
[00:36:17.660 --> 00:36:20.200]   Without that perfection, we may do things
[00:36:20.200 --> 00:36:21.320]   and then end up regretting it.
[00:36:21.320 --> 00:36:22.880]   Oh, maybe that was not the right thing.
[00:36:22.880 --> 00:36:25.040]   Or we may know what's right to do,
[00:36:25.040 --> 00:36:26.240]   and then not to do it.
[00:36:26.240 --> 00:36:28.640]   You know, one of the things that we talk about
[00:36:28.640 --> 00:36:31.160]   in marriage counseling is the key to
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:32.160]   having a good relationship,
[00:36:32.160 --> 00:36:33.700]   one of the keys to a good relationship,
[00:36:33.700 --> 00:36:37.240]   having good biblical communication, right?
[00:36:37.240 --> 00:36:40.480]   Biblical communication isn't technique, right?
[00:36:40.480 --> 00:36:42.140]   When she says this, do this.
[00:36:43.220 --> 00:36:44.300]   Make sure you say this.
[00:36:44.300 --> 00:36:45.460]   Happy wife, happy life.
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:46.820]   How do you make her happy?
[00:36:46.820 --> 00:36:48.740]   It's not about technique.
[00:36:48.740 --> 00:36:51.100]   The reason why communication has broken down
[00:36:51.100 --> 00:36:54.000]   is because it always comes through a sinful filter.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.180]   If I say this, what is she gonna think?
[00:36:57.180 --> 00:36:59.240]   Well, I don't want her to know everything.
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:00.860]   So everything that we say comes through
[00:37:00.860 --> 00:37:02.540]   a some sort of sinful filter.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:05.240]   You hurt me, so I'm gonna hurt you, right?
[00:37:05.240 --> 00:37:06.620]   I don't want you to know this.
[00:37:06.620 --> 00:37:08.600]   Or I want you to think of me in this way,
[00:37:08.600 --> 00:37:11.500]   so we exaggerate certain things and minimize other things.
[00:37:12.380 --> 00:37:15.660]   Like Jesus said, what comes out of us,
[00:37:15.660 --> 00:37:17.900]   what comes out of our mouth is what's inside of us.
[00:37:17.900 --> 00:37:19.280]   It's not what we eat that corrupts us,
[00:37:19.280 --> 00:37:21.180]   it's what comes out of us that corrupts us.
[00:37:21.180 --> 00:37:23.240]   And so what comes out of us in our words
[00:37:23.240 --> 00:37:26.780]   and our communication comes through a sinful filter.
[00:37:26.780 --> 00:37:28.740]   So basically what he is saying is
[00:37:28.740 --> 00:37:31.380]   we have a corrupt nature through which
[00:37:31.380 --> 00:37:34.580]   all communication comes out of.
[00:37:34.580 --> 00:37:37.660]   So part of the things that we study in marriage counseling
[00:37:37.660 --> 00:37:40.460]   is recognizing what they are
[00:37:40.460 --> 00:37:42.420]   and then try to be sanctified
[00:37:42.420 --> 00:37:47.060]   knowing that these things are coming up for these reasons.
[00:37:47.060 --> 00:37:48.860]   So those of you who went through marriage counseling
[00:37:48.860 --> 00:37:51.300]   with me recently, talking about how
[00:37:51.300 --> 00:37:53.300]   make sure you're a good listener, you understand,
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:37:54.960]   make sure that you don't react,
[00:37:54.960 --> 00:37:59.460]   and make sure that what you say is not exaggerated
[00:37:59.460 --> 00:38:01.980]   when you say it, and then learn how to speak the truth
[00:38:01.980 --> 00:38:04.540]   in love, that you never compromise both.
[00:38:04.540 --> 00:38:06.580]   But in the end, you can know all of that
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:10.540]   and then be in front of your wife and your husband
[00:38:10.540 --> 00:38:12.060]   knowing that you shouldn't say this,
[00:38:12.060 --> 00:38:14.420]   knowing that this is probably not the right thing to do,
[00:38:14.420 --> 00:38:15.580]   and then do it anyway.
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:19.300]   Like why, why do you know if this is going to,
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:22.020]   if this is not good, and this is gonna start,
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:24.560]   this is gonna hurt her, why would you do it anyway?
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:25.620]   Because she hurt me.
[00:38:25.620 --> 00:38:29.820]   That you know the right thing to do
[00:38:29.820 --> 00:38:31.220]   and you won't do it anyway
[00:38:31.220 --> 00:38:34.460]   because it hurts your pride,
[00:38:34.460 --> 00:38:37.100]   because you're somehow weighing the scale
[00:38:37.100 --> 00:38:38.580]   and she said, well, she did it to me,
[00:38:38.580 --> 00:38:40.380]   so I'm gonna do this to her.
[00:38:40.380 --> 00:38:42.740]   So even though we would have all the knowledge,
[00:38:42.740 --> 00:38:44.180]   we choose to do what's wrong
[00:38:44.180 --> 00:38:46.180]   because there's something corrupt in us.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:50.060]   See, if in order for God to be,
[00:38:50.060 --> 00:38:53.340]   Jesus to be immutable and perfect,
[00:38:53.340 --> 00:38:55.460]   he himself needs to be perfect,
[00:38:55.460 --> 00:38:58.180]   that he can't do something and then just,
[00:38:58.180 --> 00:39:00.140]   ah, forget it, I don't wanna do it.
[00:39:00.140 --> 00:39:02.020]   If I make a promise to you,
[00:39:02.020 --> 00:39:04.580]   I may have all intention today
[00:39:04.580 --> 00:39:05.940]   that I'm gonna fulfill this promise
[00:39:05.940 --> 00:39:08.300]   and then tomorrow I change my mind.
[00:39:08.300 --> 00:39:10.660]   You know, maybe you said something,
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.260]   maybe you did something,
[00:39:12.260 --> 00:39:14.540]   maybe I'm just not in the mood, you know,
[00:39:14.540 --> 00:39:16.540]   maybe I'm tempted by something.
[00:39:16.540 --> 00:39:20.020]   So one of the most arrogant things
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:24.220]   that a human being can say is I will, right?
[00:39:24.220 --> 00:39:26.260]   There's a reason why Jesus says,
[00:39:26.260 --> 00:39:28.820]   don't say I'm going to go to this city or that city,
[00:39:28.820 --> 00:39:30.580]   is that if the Lord wills.
[00:39:30.580 --> 00:39:32.620]   And basically what he's telling us,
[00:39:32.620 --> 00:39:34.740]   you don't have control over yourself.
[00:39:34.740 --> 00:39:37.180]   You don't have control over the circumstance.
[00:39:37.180 --> 00:39:38.860]   You don't have control over your own will.
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.540]   You may be perfectly willed today,
[00:39:41.540 --> 00:39:42.900]   but tomorrow say forget it.
[00:39:42.900 --> 00:39:45.780]   In order for him to be immutable,
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:47.500]   he himself needs to be perfect.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.300]   First John 1.5, this is the message we have heard from him
[00:39:50.300 --> 00:39:52.420]   and announced to you that God is light
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:54.860]   and in him there is no darkness at all.
[00:39:54.860 --> 00:39:57.580]   So in order for him to be immutable,
[00:39:57.580 --> 00:40:02.540]   he needs to be completely independent from any circumstance
[00:40:02.540 --> 00:40:03.780]   and he needs to remain the same
[00:40:03.780 --> 00:40:06.540]   no matter what situation, no matter when,
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:09.300]   and he himself needs to be without corruption.
[00:40:09.300 --> 00:40:13.900]   Third, Jesus is immutable because he is omnipotent,
[00:40:13.900 --> 00:40:16.220]   all powerful.
[00:40:16.220 --> 00:40:20.340]   Isaiah 40.28, do you not know, have you not heard?
[00:40:20.340 --> 00:40:21.740]   The everlasting God, the Lord,
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.420]   the creator of the ends of the earth
[00:40:23.420 --> 00:40:24.860]   does not become weary or tired.
[00:40:24.860 --> 00:40:27.500]   His understanding is inscrutable.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:33.700]   We don't have the power to fulfill what we desire.
[00:40:33.700 --> 00:40:36.600]   We may be successful in some things,
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:40.540]   but there's a reason why he said not to make oaths.
[00:40:40.540 --> 00:40:45.820]   I mean, let alone years and years of history of this,
[00:40:45.820 --> 00:40:49.140]   but for man to be able to say I will do this,
[00:40:49.140 --> 00:40:52.620]   you have to have the ability to carry that out.
[00:40:52.620 --> 00:40:55.860]   I can tell you that next year, next week,
[00:40:55.860 --> 00:40:57.620]   I was gonna be here and that's my,
[00:40:57.620 --> 00:41:00.420]   you can look at the probability, right,
[00:41:00.420 --> 00:41:02.500]   of all the years of what we experienced,
[00:41:02.500 --> 00:41:04.420]   but is it guaranteed 100%?
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:06.740]   Nothing is guaranteed.
[00:41:06.740 --> 00:41:10.420]   I may get in a car accident, there's something might happen,
[00:41:10.420 --> 00:41:13.180]   or the streets may get shut down, we don't know.
[00:41:13.180 --> 00:41:15.940]   I don't have that power.
[00:41:15.940 --> 00:41:20.540]   So the best that I can do is say I'm gonna do my best.
[00:41:20.540 --> 00:41:21.780]   I'm gonna do my best.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:25.380]   But I don't have the power to guarantee that.
[00:41:25.380 --> 00:41:27.500]   See, when God says he's gonna do something,
[00:41:27.500 --> 00:41:29.740]   he's not simply predicting.
[00:41:29.740 --> 00:41:31.340]   He's not looking down at history, he's like,
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:32.780]   I wish this will happen.
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:34.500]   That's not what he's doing.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   If God is not all powerful, if he's not omnipotent,
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:42.300]   all he can say is I hope this happens.
[00:41:42.300 --> 00:41:44.060]   I hope this happens.
[00:41:44.060 --> 00:41:46.660]   And I hope that my son will come one day
[00:41:46.660 --> 00:41:48.540]   and do what I hope he will do.
[00:41:48.540 --> 00:41:51.020]   I hope he doesn't change his mind.
[00:41:51.020 --> 00:41:53.540]   I hope the circumstances work out.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:56.620]   But the reason why he says it definitively
[00:41:56.620 --> 00:41:58.820]   is because the one who makes the promise
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:01.020]   is powerful enough to fulfill it,
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:03.500]   and he's the only one who can do that.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.340]   So in order for him to be immutable,
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:09.060]   he needs to also be all powerful.
[00:42:09.060 --> 00:42:12.100]   He needs to be above politics.
[00:42:12.100 --> 00:42:14.540]   He needs to be above the weather.
[00:42:14.540 --> 00:42:17.500]   He needs to be above whatever challenges may come
[00:42:17.500 --> 00:42:20.340]   that he is powerful enough to fulfill his purpose.
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:25.620]   Isaiah 43, 13 says, "Even from eternity I am he.
[00:42:25.620 --> 00:42:27.780]   "There is none who can deliver out of my hand.
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:31.060]   "I act, and who can reverse it?"
[00:42:31.060 --> 00:42:33.940]   He said, "I act, and who can reverse it?"
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:37.220]   What he desired, what he has planned, what he has promised,
[00:42:37.220 --> 00:42:40.500]   only he can fulfill 100%.
[00:42:40.500 --> 00:42:42.500]   That's why we can bank on him.
[00:42:42.500 --> 00:42:44.340]   That's why we anchor in him
[00:42:44.340 --> 00:42:46.540]   that whatever promises that he has made,
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:49.260]   he will fulfill if you believe it.
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:51.740]   Colossians 1, 16 through 17,
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:54.260]   "For by him all things were created,
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:56.220]   "both in heaven and on earth, visible and invisible,
[00:42:56.220 --> 00:42:58.300]   "whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authority.
[00:42:58.300 --> 00:43:01.460]   "All things have been created through him, for him.
[00:43:01.460 --> 00:43:02.500]   "He is before all things,
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:04.740]   "and in him all things hold together."
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:11.020]   The same power that created the universe by his word
[00:43:11.020 --> 00:43:14.580]   is the same power that sustains us today.
[00:43:14.580 --> 00:43:16.580]   He didn't get tired.
[00:43:16.580 --> 00:43:19.940]   He said, "Well, he created the universe in six days,
[00:43:19.940 --> 00:43:22.740]   "and then he rested on the seventh day."
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:25.060]   So he must have gotten tired.
[00:43:25.060 --> 00:43:25.900]   He needed to recover.
[00:43:25.900 --> 00:43:28.740]   Even God needed to rest.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:29.780]   It's blasphemy.
[00:43:29.780 --> 00:43:32.340]   That Sabbath that he's talking about,
[00:43:32.340 --> 00:43:34.340]   isn't he resting so he should recuperate
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:39.340]   because like us, we get tired and we need to take a nap.
[00:43:39.340 --> 00:43:41.540]   We need to re-energize so he can start over on Monday.
[00:43:41.540 --> 00:43:44.500]   That's not what Sabbath means.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:47.580]   Sabbath means that he is spiritually,
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:48.900]   in every way, he's resting.
[00:43:48.900 --> 00:43:50.180]   It doesn't mean he's not working.
[00:43:50.180 --> 00:43:52.020]   It doesn't mean that he needs to recuperate.
[00:43:52.020 --> 00:43:53.980]   It means that there is peace.
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:56.860]   Peace, that's what he created.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:43:58.580]   That's what he brought us into,
[00:43:58.580 --> 00:44:01.380]   and that's what was broken, peace.
[00:44:01.380 --> 00:44:05.980]   Now where this immutability is so important,
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:09.020]   or immutability and his omnipotence is so important,
[00:44:09.020 --> 00:44:11.380]   you know, when you desire something so much,
[00:44:11.380 --> 00:44:15.420]   and you can't fulfill it by your own power,
[00:44:15.420 --> 00:44:18.940]   that's when we become desperate for Christ, right?
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:22.180]   Somebody is sick, and you're crying out to God
[00:44:22.180 --> 00:44:23.540]   because you have no power.
[00:44:24.900 --> 00:44:27.020]   If you've raised children, you know,
[00:44:27.020 --> 00:44:29.640]   I remember when our children were younger,
[00:44:29.640 --> 00:44:31.260]   and they would come back from school and say,
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:33.860]   "Hey, somebody picked on me."
[00:44:33.860 --> 00:44:36.660]   And again, being from an immigrant family,
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:39.100]   moving at a new school every single year,
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:42.940]   and having to defend myself, and so hyper-sensitive to that.
[00:44:42.940 --> 00:44:47.540]   And I remember like, what can I do to help?
[00:44:47.540 --> 00:44:51.940]   You know, I wanted to teach them how to box.
[00:44:51.940 --> 00:44:55.060]   If MMA was popular, then I would teach them some MMA moves,
[00:44:55.060 --> 00:44:57.060]   that this is what I would do.
[00:44:57.060 --> 00:44:59.220]   But at the core of who we are,
[00:44:59.220 --> 00:45:01.060]   like, I wish I could take your place.
[00:45:01.060 --> 00:45:04.340]   I wish I could take away your pain.
[00:45:04.340 --> 00:45:06.780]   I wish I could change your circumstance.
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:08.920]   There's stuff that even now,
[00:45:08.920 --> 00:45:11.340]   that some of you guys are going through,
[00:45:11.340 --> 00:45:13.140]   some of the struggles that you have.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.940]   And as we pray, and as we wrestle,
[00:45:15.940 --> 00:45:19.200]   I wish I could somehow just click a button,
[00:45:19.200 --> 00:45:21.620]   and do something, and take away some of that pain,
[00:45:21.620 --> 00:45:23.340]   and have no power.
[00:45:23.340 --> 00:45:29.220]   As much as I care, as much as I desire,
[00:45:29.220 --> 00:45:30.560]   I don't have that power.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:36.640]   And the longer I live, the more I'm aware of that.
[00:45:36.640 --> 00:45:40.000]   See, in order for God to be able to fulfill his promise,
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.100]   he has to be omnipotent, and only God is omnipotent.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:44.700]   And in order for him to be immutable,
[00:45:44.700 --> 00:45:46.700]   he needs to be omnipotent as well.
[00:45:46.700 --> 00:45:48.900]   But fourth and finally, Jesus is immutable
[00:45:48.900 --> 00:45:51.100]   because he is all-knowing, he is omniscient.
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:52.860]   He knows all things.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:55.260]   Psalm 147, verse five said,
[00:45:55.260 --> 00:45:57.300]   "Great is our Lord, and abundant in strength.
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.180]   His understanding is infinite."
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:05.720]   Everything that he has done was based upon all knowledge.
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:09.940]   There's nothing that surprises him because he is omniscient.
[00:46:09.940 --> 00:46:14.480]   So everything that he has promised in the past,
[00:46:14.480 --> 00:46:16.020]   everything he is doing now,
[00:46:16.020 --> 00:46:18.340]   and everything he will fulfill in the future,
[00:46:18.340 --> 00:46:23.340]   is based upon all knowledge because he is omniscient.
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:27.300]   If it was not based on his omniscience,
[00:46:27.300 --> 00:46:29.460]   the more he finds out about the future,
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.700]   the more understanding that he has,
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.620]   he'll change his mind, just like we do, right?
[00:46:34.620 --> 00:46:40.040]   How many of us, if we were to turn the clock back 10 years,
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:41.440]   would do things differently?
[00:46:41.440 --> 00:46:43.320]   Every single one of us.
[00:46:43.320 --> 00:46:47.260]   There's a reason why we have New Year's resolution,
[00:46:47.260 --> 00:46:50.380]   because based upon the knowledge that I have now,
[00:46:50.380 --> 00:46:51.880]   I would do things differently.
[00:46:51.880 --> 00:46:55.720]   And usually the people who have the biggest opinions,
[00:46:55.720 --> 00:46:59.260]   the seniors in college, right,
[00:46:59.260 --> 00:47:01.260]   have so much to say to the freshmen,
[00:47:01.260 --> 00:47:05.300]   because you've experienced four years of college,
[00:47:05.300 --> 00:47:07.060]   and it's like, "Don't do that.
[00:47:07.060 --> 00:47:09.740]   Don't take 20 units, right?
[00:47:09.740 --> 00:47:11.440]   Don't get classes at 8 a.m.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:12.740]   You're not gonna make it."
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:14.420]   (audience laughing)
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:15.860]   And so, because they have four years,
[00:47:15.860 --> 00:47:17.620]   so if they were to reverse the clock back,
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:19.140]   they would probably live their freshman year
[00:47:19.140 --> 00:47:21.020]   a little bit differently.
[00:47:21.020 --> 00:47:23.380]   Those of you who graduated and who are working,
[00:47:23.380 --> 00:47:25.420]   now that you know what work life is like,
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:29.340]   hold on to college for dear life.
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:31.700]   Don't be so eager to get out.
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:33.580]   It was so good then, right?
[00:47:33.580 --> 00:47:35.220]   Every stage of life, we look back,
[00:47:35.220 --> 00:47:38.820]   because you have gained more knowledge, right?
[00:47:38.820 --> 00:47:40.540]   You get married, and then you tell the singles,
[00:47:40.540 --> 00:47:42.020]   "Hey, don't be so eager."
[00:47:42.020 --> 00:47:45.300]   Not that marriage is bad.
[00:47:46.020 --> 00:47:49.300]   But singleness is good, too, right?
[00:47:49.300 --> 00:47:50.700]   They say, "Oh, we wanna have kids."
[00:47:50.700 --> 00:47:52.740]   It's like, "Hey, don't rush it.
[00:47:52.740 --> 00:47:53.660]   Enjoy what you have."
[00:47:53.660 --> 00:47:56.180]   So every stage of life, we have things that,
[00:47:56.180 --> 00:47:59.220]   because we've gained more knowledge, more experience,
[00:47:59.220 --> 00:48:00.500]   we look back and it says,
[00:48:00.500 --> 00:48:04.100]   "That knowledge caused us to look at that circumstance,
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:06.660]   and I would do things differently."
[00:48:06.660 --> 00:48:08.460]   Even in our deathbed, every single person
[00:48:08.460 --> 00:48:10.160]   will look back at their life and say,
[00:48:10.160 --> 00:48:12.540]   "Now that I've accumulated this knowledge,
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:14.860]   I would live my life differently."
[00:48:14.860 --> 00:48:17.540]   Because we didn't have that knowledge at that time.
[00:48:17.540 --> 00:48:19.820]   In order for an individual to be immutable,
[00:48:19.820 --> 00:48:22.380]   he needs to have all knowledge.
[00:48:22.380 --> 00:48:24.180]   That he doesn't have more knowledge
[00:48:24.180 --> 00:48:26.500]   a thousand years later, 10,000 years later,
[00:48:26.500 --> 00:48:28.180]   because everything that he does
[00:48:28.180 --> 00:48:30.700]   is based upon perfect knowledge.
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:32.300]   He is omniscient.
[00:48:32.300 --> 00:48:34.260]   And that's why it says, 1 John 3:20,
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:36.260]   "In whatever heart condemns us,
[00:48:36.260 --> 00:48:40.940]   our God is greater than our hearts and knows all things."
[00:48:40.940 --> 00:48:41.860]   He knows all things.
[00:48:41.860 --> 00:48:42.920]   Psalm 139, verse four,
[00:48:42.920 --> 00:48:44.640]   "Even before there is a word on my tongue,
[00:48:44.640 --> 00:48:47.300]   behold, O Lord, you know it all."
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:51.700]   He does not change.
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.220]   Now, all of these four qualities
[00:48:54.220 --> 00:48:57.360]   are necessary for God to be immutable.
[00:48:57.360 --> 00:49:01.300]   He needs to be independent, he needs to be perfect.
[00:49:01.300 --> 00:49:04.180]   He needs to be omnipotent, and he needs to be omniscient.
[00:49:04.180 --> 00:49:06.260]   So that's why that statement in verse eight
[00:49:06.260 --> 00:49:08.700]   can only be applied to God himself,
[00:49:08.700 --> 00:49:11.180]   'cause only God himself is immutable.
[00:49:12.860 --> 00:49:14.720]   So what does this have to do with what he's trying to say
[00:49:14.720 --> 00:49:16.020]   here, not to drift?
[00:49:16.020 --> 00:49:22.120]   Everything that we know of Christ
[00:49:22.120 --> 00:49:26.020]   and his sacrifice for us means it's immutable.
[00:49:26.020 --> 00:49:30.240]   His love for us is immutable.
[00:49:30.240 --> 00:49:35.140]   His love for us is based upon his perfection.
[00:49:35.140 --> 00:49:38.720]   In Malachi 3, 6, it says,
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:40.280]   "For I, the Lord, do not change.
[00:49:40.280 --> 00:49:43.460]   Therefore, you, O sons of Jacob, are not consumed."
[00:49:43.460 --> 00:49:45.740]   Because he didn't change his mind,
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:47.220]   he didn't make a decision,
[00:49:47.220 --> 00:49:48.300]   and then something inside of him is like,
[00:49:48.300 --> 00:49:50.260]   "I don't love these people anymore.
[00:49:50.260 --> 00:49:51.620]   I'm so tired of this."
[00:49:51.620 --> 00:49:56.780]   So his love for us, his choosing of us, is immutable.
[00:49:56.780 --> 00:49:59.860]   That's why even though you can misapply it
[00:49:59.860 --> 00:50:02.340]   and people abuse this term,
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:04.660]   but the statement in itself is true.
[00:50:04.660 --> 00:50:06.700]   One saved, always saved.
[00:50:07.680 --> 00:50:10.560]   Because our salvation justification
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:13.380]   is based upon his perfection.
[00:50:13.380 --> 00:50:17.500]   And he doesn't change, he doesn't change his mind
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:19.200]   10 years later, 15 years later.
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.320]   So his love for us is immutable because he is perfect.
[00:50:23.320 --> 00:50:28.320]   God's love for us does not change because of circumstance.
[00:50:28.320 --> 00:50:32.520]   When Jesus says, "I will build my church
[00:50:32.520 --> 00:50:35.920]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:50:35.920 --> 00:50:37.820]   If you think about church history,
[00:50:37.820 --> 00:50:43.680]   if it was based upon our will, our purpose,
[00:50:43.680 --> 00:50:46.840]   I mean, God would have changed his mind a long time ago.
[00:50:46.840 --> 00:50:48.100]   I don't think we would have ever made it
[00:50:48.100 --> 00:50:49.340]   out of the first century.
[00:50:49.340 --> 00:50:51.660]   We would have never made it out.
[00:50:51.660 --> 00:50:54.780]   But think about how in the 2,000 years of church history,
[00:50:54.780 --> 00:50:57.500]   the kind of chaos that we've seen.
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:51:00.160]   Church actually killed people
[00:51:00.160 --> 00:51:02.780]   who wanted to translate the Bible for us,
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:03.900]   burned them at the stake.
[00:51:03.900 --> 00:51:05.260]   And if anybody questioned them,
[00:51:05.260 --> 00:51:07.140]   they brought in the Inquisition.
[00:51:07.140 --> 00:51:09.700]   And if you go against us, we'll torture you.
[00:51:09.700 --> 00:51:11.700]   And then because they were greedy for gain,
[00:51:11.700 --> 00:51:13.180]   they started selling indulgences
[00:51:13.180 --> 00:51:14.720]   so that they can become rich.
[00:51:14.720 --> 00:51:16.500]   All kinds of stuff came inside the church.
[00:51:16.500 --> 00:51:19.220]   And even today, there's all kinds of chaos in the church.
[00:51:19.220 --> 00:51:20.540]   If it was based upon us,
[00:51:20.540 --> 00:51:22.800]   that promise would have been broken.
[00:51:22.800 --> 00:51:25.700]   It would have never made it out the first century.
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.720]   But God's purpose does not change based on circumstance.
[00:51:30.940 --> 00:51:35.260]   And we anchor with his promise because he is immutable,
[00:51:35.260 --> 00:51:39.160]   because he is independent, because he is I am.
[00:51:39.160 --> 00:51:44.200]   And what he says, he fulfills because he does not change.
[00:51:44.200 --> 00:51:49.700]   God's love for us is sustained by his power.
[00:51:49.700 --> 00:51:52.620]   Isaiah 46, 9 through 11 says,
[00:51:52.620 --> 00:51:54.380]   "Remember the former things long past,
[00:51:54.380 --> 00:51:57.360]   "for I am God and there is no other.
[00:51:57.360 --> 00:51:59.020]   "I am God and there is no one like me,
[00:51:59.020 --> 00:52:00.560]   "declaring the end from the beginning
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:03.940]   "and from ancient times things which have not been done,
[00:52:03.940 --> 00:52:06.380]   "saying my purpose will be established
[00:52:06.380 --> 00:52:08.880]   "and I will accomplish my good pleasure.
[00:52:08.880 --> 00:52:10.500]   "Calling a bird, pray from the east,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:13.220]   "a man of my purpose from far country.
[00:52:13.220 --> 00:52:15.560]   "Truly I have spoken, truly I will bring to pass.
[00:52:15.560 --> 00:52:18.900]   "I have planned it, surely I will do it."
[00:52:18.900 --> 00:52:23.780]   No being can ever say this.
[00:52:23.780 --> 00:52:26.400]   I can say, I hope this happens.
[00:52:26.400 --> 00:52:28.600]   I'm gonna do my best that this will happen.
[00:52:29.860 --> 00:52:32.440]   But only God says, I will do it.
[00:52:32.440 --> 00:52:34.980]   You can bank on this, you can anchor yourself on this,
[00:52:34.980 --> 00:52:36.520]   because God is all powerful.
[00:52:36.520 --> 00:52:42.080]   Only he can promise it and fulfill it all the time.
[00:52:42.080 --> 00:52:45.520]   That's why when he speaks, whether it is in Genesis
[00:52:45.520 --> 00:52:48.080]   and whether it is in the last chapter of Revelation,
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.260]   it's fulfilled.
[00:52:49.260 --> 00:52:53.800]   You can bank on it, because he's the only being
[00:52:53.800 --> 00:52:54.980]   who has that kind of power.
[00:52:54.980 --> 00:52:56.620]   So when he says,
[00:52:58.160 --> 00:52:59.820]   "If you confess your sins and your faithful
[00:52:59.820 --> 00:53:01.160]   "and just forgive you of all wrongs,"
[00:53:01.160 --> 00:53:02.200]   he has the power.
[00:53:02.200 --> 00:53:06.080]   He has the power, only he has the power.
[00:53:06.080 --> 00:53:08.040]   First Peter one through to five, he says,
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:10.300]   "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:53:10.300 --> 00:53:12.260]   "who according to his great mercy
[00:53:12.260 --> 00:53:15.180]   "has caused us to be born again,
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:17.460]   "to a living hope,
[00:53:17.460 --> 00:53:19.260]   "through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead,
[00:53:19.260 --> 00:53:22.740]   "to obtain an inheritance which is imperishable,
[00:53:22.740 --> 00:53:25.560]   "undefiled, and will not fade,
[00:53:25.560 --> 00:53:27.600]   "reserved in heaven for you."
[00:53:27.600 --> 00:53:29.480]   The reason why the hope that we have,
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:32.000]   the salvation that we have is imperishable,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.780]   undefiled, and does not fade,
[00:53:33.780 --> 00:53:37.720]   is because God is the one who sustains it.
[00:53:37.720 --> 00:53:41.160]   He does not change.
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:44.600]   He doesn't drift because of circumstance.
[00:53:44.600 --> 00:53:46.900]   He doesn't get tired.
[00:53:46.900 --> 00:53:49.720]   He says, "Who are protected by the power of God
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:50.880]   "through faith for salvation,
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:52.960]   "ready to be revealed in the last time."
[00:53:52.960 --> 00:53:55.400]   Only God is all powerful
[00:53:55.400 --> 00:53:58.060]   and is able to fulfill what he desires.
[00:53:58.060 --> 00:54:00.840]   Fourth and finally, God's love for us
[00:54:00.840 --> 00:54:05.140]   is based on all knowledge, past, present, and future.
[00:54:05.140 --> 00:54:08.440]   I want you to think about that.
[00:54:08.440 --> 00:54:11.400]   When God justified us,
[00:54:11.400 --> 00:54:15.480]   he justified us based upon
[00:54:15.480 --> 00:54:17.940]   all that he knew of you and me,
[00:54:17.940 --> 00:54:20.700]   past, present, and future.
[00:54:20.700 --> 00:54:23.480]   He didn't look at us and say,
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:25.700]   "Well, he's worth investing in.
[00:54:25.700 --> 00:54:27.120]   "Let's see what happens."
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:29.640]   Let me justify him now,
[00:54:29.640 --> 00:54:33.480]   and then hopefully he's not gonna screw up.
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:36.840]   His justification, his choosing of us
[00:54:36.840 --> 00:54:38.800]   was based upon all knowledge,
[00:54:38.800 --> 00:54:40.880]   past, present, and future.
[00:54:40.880 --> 00:54:43.880]   So there is no shock.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:46.480]   Some of us may be sitting here,
[00:54:46.480 --> 00:54:49.080]   it's like, "Yeah, but you don't know what I've done.
[00:54:49.080 --> 00:54:51.880]   "You don't know how far I've drifted."
[00:54:53.160 --> 00:54:54.760]   His love for us, his choosing of us,
[00:54:54.760 --> 00:54:56.880]   his justification of us was based upon
[00:54:56.880 --> 00:55:00.180]   all perfect knowledge, past, present, and future.
[00:55:00.180 --> 00:55:02.360]   So there's nothing that you have done.
[00:55:02.360 --> 00:55:05.840]   There's nothing that you have done
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.400]   that he did not know.
[00:55:07.400 --> 00:55:11.120]   Psalm 139, one through 12.
[00:55:11.120 --> 00:55:14.360]   This is a passage that we look at,
[00:55:14.360 --> 00:55:17.100]   and typically we think this is
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:19.400]   the psalmist trying to hide from God.
[00:55:19.400 --> 00:55:21.680]   It sounds negative in the beginning.
[00:55:21.680 --> 00:55:23.000]   This is what he says.
[00:55:23.000 --> 00:55:24.640]   "Oh Lord, you have searched me and known me.
[00:55:24.640 --> 00:55:27.920]   "You know when I sit down and when I rise up.
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:29.840]   "You understand my thoughts from afar.
[00:55:29.840 --> 00:55:32.280]   "You scrutinize my path and lying down."
[00:55:32.280 --> 00:55:35.680]   Scrutinize, like he examines, he knows all things.
[00:55:35.680 --> 00:55:38.240]   "Intimately acquainted with all my ways."
[00:55:38.240 --> 00:55:40.280]   Think about that.
[00:55:40.280 --> 00:55:45.320]   Every single one of us, we try to hide.
[00:55:45.320 --> 00:55:51.640]   It doesn't matter if you're an introvert or an extrovert.
[00:55:51.640 --> 00:55:56.000]   Nobody is perfectly open, even with our wives,
[00:55:56.000 --> 00:55:57.320]   even with our husbands.
[00:55:57.320 --> 00:55:59.440]   There are things that you don't share perfectly
[00:55:59.440 --> 00:56:01.480]   with even your husband and wife.
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.460]   Sometimes we get into trouble because they find out
[00:56:04.460 --> 00:56:07.300]   whether you want to or not, but nobody is perfectly open
[00:56:07.300 --> 00:56:09.140]   because there are things that we want to hide.
[00:56:09.140 --> 00:56:10.840]   But he said before God, there's nothing hidden.
[00:56:10.840 --> 00:56:13.200]   He scrutinizes everything.
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:14.760]   "Intimately acquainted with all my ways,
[00:56:14.760 --> 00:56:16.680]   "even before there's a word on my tongue.
[00:56:16.680 --> 00:56:18.440]   "Behold, oh Lord, you know it all.
[00:56:18.440 --> 00:56:21.300]   "You have enclosed me behind and before,
[00:56:21.300 --> 00:56:22.440]   "and laid your hand upon me.
[00:56:22.440 --> 00:56:24.140]   "Such knowledge is too wonderful for me.
[00:56:24.140 --> 00:56:26.120]   "It is too high, I cannot attain it."
[00:56:26.120 --> 00:56:28.560]   Imagine if we try so hard to hide,
[00:56:28.560 --> 00:56:30.800]   even from somebody that loves us,
[00:56:30.800 --> 00:56:34.600]   made a covenant relationship, and yet he says, "God knows."
[00:56:34.600 --> 00:56:40.480]   We try so hard to present ourselves a certain way.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.000]   We want you to see what we're good at.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:44.000]   We try so hard to hide the things that we're not good at,
[00:56:44.000 --> 00:56:46.040]   and he said, "We stand before God, there's nothing hidden,
[00:56:46.040 --> 00:56:48.000]   "even the things that you do not know."
[00:56:49.560 --> 00:56:51.340]   Even your blind spots, God knows.
[00:56:51.340 --> 00:56:54.620]   Even before you open your mouth, God already knew.
[00:56:54.620 --> 00:56:56.060]   Does that make you nervous?
[00:56:56.060 --> 00:57:00.500]   And this is an all-powerful, almighty, holy, holy, holy God
[00:57:00.500 --> 00:57:03.220]   that knows every part of who you are.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   So when we read this, our natural reaction isn't like,
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:10.860]   "Oh, that's good."
[00:57:10.860 --> 00:57:14.700]   No, it's like, "Does that make you nervous?
[00:57:14.700 --> 00:57:16.580]   "I can't hide from this God?"
[00:57:18.020 --> 00:57:19.520]   That's what he said, verse seven,
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:21.560]   "Where can I go from your spirit?
[00:57:21.560 --> 00:57:23.820]   "Where can I flee from your presence?
[00:57:23.820 --> 00:57:25.360]   "If I ascend to heaven, you are there.
[00:57:25.360 --> 00:57:27.740]   "If I make my bed in Sheol, behold, you are there.
[00:57:27.740 --> 00:57:29.280]   "If I take the wings of the dawn,
[00:57:29.280 --> 00:57:31.700]   "if I dwell in the remotest part of the sea,
[00:57:31.700 --> 00:57:33.920]   "even there, your hand will lead me,
[00:57:33.920 --> 00:57:35.760]   "and your right hand will lay hold of me."
[00:57:35.760 --> 00:57:36.740]   Did you get that?
[00:57:36.740 --> 00:57:40.620]   He says, "I can go everywhere, I can hide,
[00:57:40.620 --> 00:57:43.160]   "I can do all the things, but even there, you are there."
[00:57:43.160 --> 00:57:44.960]   Why is he there?
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:47.920]   He says, "Even after knowing everything that you know,
[00:57:47.920 --> 00:57:50.160]   "even after I try to hide from you
[00:57:50.160 --> 00:57:53.340]   "as to the darkest of seas,"
[00:57:53.340 --> 00:57:55.000]   he says, what does he say?
[00:57:55.000 --> 00:57:59.120]   "You hold me in your right hand."
[00:57:59.120 --> 00:58:02.440]   You know everything.
[00:58:02.440 --> 00:58:05.320]   You know everything.
[00:58:05.320 --> 00:58:08.580]   And you hold me with your right hand.
[00:58:08.580 --> 00:58:12.060]   "If I say, 'Surely the darkness will overwhelm me,
[00:58:12.060 --> 00:58:14.860]   "and the light from around me will be night,'
[00:58:14.860 --> 00:58:16.340]   "even the darkness is not dark to you,
[00:58:16.340 --> 00:58:17.780]   "and the night is not bright as the day,
[00:58:17.780 --> 00:58:19.920]   "darkness and light are like to you.
[00:58:19.920 --> 00:58:22.540]   "Even though you know everything of me
[00:58:22.540 --> 00:58:24.700]   "from past, present, and future,
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:27.220]   "you hold me with your right hand."
[00:58:27.220 --> 00:58:30.020]   You would think that after, it's like,
[00:58:30.020 --> 00:58:32.040]   you know everything, even before I speak,
[00:58:32.040 --> 00:58:34.800]   even the things I try so hard to hide,
[00:58:34.800 --> 00:58:36.640]   even the things that I don't tell my wife
[00:58:36.640 --> 00:58:40.040]   or don't tell my husband, nobody knows this,
[00:58:40.040 --> 00:58:42.360]   and you know all things.
[00:58:42.360 --> 00:58:44.780]   Where can I go from your spirit?
[00:58:44.780 --> 00:58:47.480]   What darkness is going to hide me?
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:49.260]   And yet you know all this,
[00:58:49.260 --> 00:58:51.760]   and you hold me with your right hand.
[00:58:51.760 --> 00:58:56.480]   His love for us, his justification,
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:59:00.720]   is based upon all knowledge, past, present, and future.
[00:59:00.720 --> 00:59:05.360]   A holy God cannot invite us to himself
[00:59:05.360 --> 00:59:08.840]   if it is not covered by his perfect love.
[00:59:08.840 --> 00:59:12.080]   He cannot say, "Come to me, all who are weary
[00:59:12.080 --> 00:59:14.620]   "and heavy laden, and I will give you rest,"
[00:59:14.620 --> 00:59:17.540]   if we are not covered by his perfect love.
[00:59:17.540 --> 00:59:22.580]   You know, one of the passages that I share a lot
[00:59:22.580 --> 00:59:26.360]   is because it sustained me for so many years.
[00:59:26.360 --> 00:59:29.940]   In Luke chapter 22, verse 31 and 34,
[00:59:29.940 --> 00:59:31.800]   before Jesus goes to the cross,
[00:59:31.800 --> 00:59:34.700]   he tells Peter, "Simon, Simon,
[00:59:34.700 --> 00:59:36.140]   "behold, Satan has demanded permission
[00:59:36.140 --> 00:59:38.120]   "to sift you like wheat,
[00:59:38.120 --> 00:59:41.120]   "but I have prayed for you that your faith will not fail."
[00:59:42.280 --> 00:59:44.900]   Jesus says, "Satan has to get permission
[00:59:44.900 --> 00:59:48.240]   "to attack you and sift you, basically destroy you."
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:51.240]   Peter said, "I prayed for you so your faith will not fail."
[00:59:51.240 --> 00:59:54.240]   But then right after that, he says,
[00:59:54.240 --> 00:59:57.280]   "When once you have turned again,
[00:59:57.280 --> 00:59:58.340]   "strengthen your brothers."
[00:59:58.340 --> 01:00:00.240]   Turned again, what is he referring to?
[01:00:00.240 --> 01:00:03.020]   Turned again, I thought he just prayed
[01:00:03.020 --> 01:00:04.480]   that he wouldn't fail.
[01:00:04.480 --> 01:00:05.640]   And he says, "When you turn."
[01:00:05.640 --> 01:00:06.480]   Turn from what?
[01:00:06.480 --> 01:00:07.980]   Turn from his failure.
[01:00:07.980 --> 01:00:10.220]   And he tells him, and Peter says,
[01:00:10.220 --> 01:00:11.720]   "Lord, with you I am ready to go,
[01:00:11.720 --> 01:00:13.920]   "both to prison and to death."
[01:00:13.920 --> 01:00:15.680]   Peter understood what he meant.
[01:00:15.680 --> 01:00:17.620]   "You just told me that you prayed that I would not fail,
[01:00:17.620 --> 01:00:20.160]   "and then you just told me I'm gonna fail, which is it?"
[01:00:20.160 --> 01:00:21.220]   And Peter says,
[01:00:21.220 --> 01:00:26.840]   "Matthew, the tax collector, yeah, I can see that guy."
[01:00:26.840 --> 01:00:27.660]   Right?
[01:00:27.660 --> 01:00:28.600]   Soon as he gets pressured,
[01:00:28.600 --> 01:00:31.360]   I mean, he's gonna go back collecting taxes.
[01:00:31.360 --> 01:00:35.040]   James and John, these guys can't control their temper.
[01:00:35.040 --> 01:00:36.880]   Right, they wanted to kill anyway.
[01:00:36.880 --> 01:00:39.640]   Soon as he gets pressured, yeah, I can see them going.
[01:00:39.640 --> 01:00:40.600]   Right?
[01:00:40.600 --> 01:00:44.080]   And he said, "All of these may go, but I will not."
[01:00:44.080 --> 01:00:45.960]   And I think Peter meant it.
[01:00:45.960 --> 01:00:48.280]   And we see that the Garden of Gethsemane,
[01:00:48.280 --> 01:00:49.820]   when the soldiers of the temple come,
[01:00:49.820 --> 01:00:53.560]   and he took out his little knife, "Let's go."
[01:00:53.560 --> 01:00:54.540]   He meant it.
[01:00:54.540 --> 01:00:57.720]   But Jesus knew exactly what was gonna happen,
[01:00:57.720 --> 01:00:59.460]   because he knows all things.
[01:00:59.460 --> 01:01:02.540]   But he says to Peter,
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:05.940]   "Today, you will deny me three times."
[01:01:05.940 --> 01:01:09.520]   Not only would he fail, he will fail miserably.
[01:01:09.520 --> 01:01:12.000]   And he will fail in a grander scale
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:13.540]   than all the other disciples.
[01:01:13.540 --> 01:01:15.360]   'Cause he was there, and he said,
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:17.440]   "I don't know him," to his face.
[01:01:17.440 --> 01:01:20.680]   After everything that Jesus has done,
[01:01:20.680 --> 01:01:23.960]   after spending three years walking with him,
[01:01:23.960 --> 01:01:25.120]   talking with him,
[01:01:25.120 --> 01:01:29.240]   showing, seeing all the miracles that he saw firsthand,
[01:01:29.240 --> 01:01:32.920]   and when it came down to
[01:01:32.920 --> 01:01:38.360]   when Jesus needed his disciples the most,
[01:01:38.360 --> 01:01:40.040]   they failed him miserably.
[01:01:40.040 --> 01:01:43.360]   So I remember looking at this passage,
[01:01:43.360 --> 01:01:45.600]   and doing quiet time as a young Christian,
[01:01:45.600 --> 01:01:47.200]   I said, "I don't get this."
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:50.120]   He said, "I said, 'I will pray for you,
[01:01:50.120 --> 01:01:51.760]   "'for you won't fail,'"
[01:01:51.760 --> 01:01:54.120]   and then he said, "But you will fail miserably."
[01:01:54.120 --> 01:01:57.320]   And it dawned on me,
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:02:00.360]   when he said, "I pray you wouldn't fail,"
[01:02:00.360 --> 01:02:02.640]   he's not talking about this failure.
[01:02:02.640 --> 01:02:05.840]   He was telling him to get up.
[01:02:07.840 --> 01:02:10.360]   When you fail, get back up.
[01:02:10.360 --> 01:02:15.680]   When you're disappointed in yourself,
[01:02:15.680 --> 01:02:18.520]   and you feel like you've exhausted his love for you,
[01:02:18.520 --> 01:02:20.360]   get back up.
[01:02:20.360 --> 01:02:22.560]   Get back up.
[01:02:22.560 --> 01:02:27.020]   Jesus says, "If you confess your sins,
[01:02:27.020 --> 01:02:28.480]   "he is faithful and just to forgive you
[01:02:28.480 --> 01:02:30.260]   "of all your unrighteousness."
[01:02:30.260 --> 01:02:34.000]   He already knew, 'cause he has all knowledge,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.660]   past, present, and future.
[01:02:37.040 --> 01:02:40.760]   You know, all these years of doing ministry,
[01:02:40.760 --> 01:02:45.760]   you know, I have years and years of scars in my heart,
[01:02:45.760 --> 01:02:50.440]   memories of pain, of dealing with sinners, like you.
[01:02:50.440 --> 01:02:52.960]   Yeah, I'm talking about you.
[01:02:52.960 --> 01:02:58.960]   But with all the stuff that I can think of,
[01:02:58.960 --> 01:03:00.800]   my greatest struggle hasn't been you.
[01:03:00.800 --> 01:03:05.280]   My greatest struggle has always been me.
[01:03:06.960 --> 01:03:08.260]   My own corruption.
[01:03:08.260 --> 01:03:12.480]   My own greed, my own coveting, my own lust.
[01:03:12.480 --> 01:03:17.600]   Trying to remain in Christ, trying to persevere,
[01:03:17.600 --> 01:03:21.520]   trying to practice the love that he gave me,
[01:03:21.520 --> 01:03:23.680]   and struggling to practice this.
[01:03:23.680 --> 01:03:27.560]   And there've been time and time again,
[01:03:27.560 --> 01:03:30.960]   not simply because I'm disappointed in the church,
[01:03:30.960 --> 01:03:32.440]   but this is too hard for me.
[01:03:32.440 --> 01:03:36.520]   And yet I persevere because I know
[01:03:36.520 --> 01:03:39.540]   that it is not my righteousness that calls me up here.
[01:03:39.540 --> 01:03:44.040]   I persevere because of his righteousness.
[01:03:44.040 --> 01:03:47.840]   I stand here and tell you of his mercy,
[01:03:47.840 --> 01:03:52.080]   of his endurance, of his justification,
[01:03:52.080 --> 01:03:54.960]   of his sanctification, of his glorification.
[01:03:54.960 --> 01:04:01.560]   So his love for us is immutable, does not change.
[01:04:03.440 --> 01:04:07.200]   Preserved with power, based upon all knowledge.
[01:04:07.200 --> 01:04:12.320]   That's why he says, "Fix your eyes upon Jesus,
[01:04:12.320 --> 01:04:15.160]   "the author, the beginner, and the finisher,
[01:04:15.160 --> 01:04:17.280]   "the perfecter of our faith."
[01:04:17.280 --> 01:04:20.240]   That's why the only way we can persevere
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:22.800]   if we're anchored to this God, amen?
[01:04:22.800 --> 01:04:25.160]   Anchored to this God.
[01:04:25.160 --> 01:04:27.520]   I don't know where you are in your faith.
[01:04:27.520 --> 01:04:30.500]   I don't know what discouragement you brought into this room.
[01:04:30.500 --> 01:04:31.760]   I don't know what frustration,
[01:04:31.760 --> 01:04:32.600]   I don't know what bitterness
[01:04:32.600 --> 01:04:34.480]   that you may have brought into this room.
[01:04:34.480 --> 01:04:37.700]   But the only way that you and I will persevere
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.640]   is recognizing Jesus Christ,
[01:04:40.640 --> 01:04:44.180]   who is the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:04:44.180 --> 01:04:46.400]   And we will persevere in him.
[01:04:46.400 --> 01:04:47.240]   Let's pray.
[01:04:47.240 --> 01:04:56.520]   Gracious Father, we come before you
[01:04:56.520 --> 01:05:00.140]   needing your mercy and grace.
[01:05:01.920 --> 01:05:04.120]   Remembering, Lord God, when you called us.
[01:05:04.120 --> 01:05:08.080]   Knowing, Father, that it is only by your grace
[01:05:08.080 --> 01:05:11.280]   that we are able to be covered by your blood.
[01:05:11.280 --> 01:05:16.360]   I pray, Father God, if we've drifted from that,
[01:05:16.360 --> 01:05:19.720]   we have forgotten the preciousness
[01:05:19.720 --> 01:05:23.140]   of what Christ has done for us and who he is to us.
[01:05:23.140 --> 01:05:27.760]   Help us to remember the height from which we have fallen,
[01:05:27.760 --> 01:05:31.360]   to repent and redo the things that you've given us
[01:05:31.360 --> 01:05:33.480]   that we may remain in him, continue with him,
[01:05:33.480 --> 01:05:36.780]   trust him, follow him, and to be anchored with him.
[01:05:36.780 --> 01:05:40.400]   That we may bear all fruit for the sake of your name.
[01:05:40.400 --> 01:05:43.400]   Lord, we eagerly wait for the coming of Christ.
[01:05:43.400 --> 01:05:46.480]   Like despite all our weaknesses, Lord,
[01:05:46.480 --> 01:05:49.320]   that you challenge us to persevere.
[01:05:49.320 --> 01:05:52.840]   If we have fallen as you challenged, Peter,
[01:05:52.840 --> 01:05:54.160]   help us, Lord, to get up.
[01:05:54.160 --> 01:05:57.780]   Help us, Lord God, to ask for forgiveness,
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:00.400]   to be restored and persevere
[01:06:00.400 --> 01:06:02.200]   by the grace that you've given us,
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:04.640]   past, present, and future.
[01:06:04.640 --> 01:06:06.400]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:06:06.400 --> 01:06:09.520]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:06:09.520 --> 01:06:15.160]   (gentle piano music)
[01:06:15.160 --> 01:06:16.040]   - As we continue our worship,
[01:06:16.040 --> 01:06:18.160]   let us sing of his great faithfulness.

[01:10:55.160 --> 01:10:58.920]   Hebrews chapter 6, 17 to 20.
[01:10:58.920 --> 01:11:01.440]   In the same way God desiring even more to show
[01:11:01.440 --> 01:11:02.800]   to the heirs of the promise,
[01:11:02.800 --> 01:11:05.160]   the unchangeableness of his purpose,
[01:11:05.160 --> 01:11:06.920]   interpose with an oath,
[01:11:06.920 --> 01:11:08.400]   so that by two unchangeable things
[01:11:08.400 --> 01:11:10.920]   in which it is impossible for God to lie,
[01:11:10.920 --> 01:11:13.640]   we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement
[01:11:13.640 --> 01:11:16.320]   to take hold of the hope set before us.
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:18.680]   This hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
[01:11:18.680 --> 01:11:21.180]   a hope both sure and steadfast,
[01:11:21.180 --> 01:11:23.400]   one which enters within the veil,
[01:11:23.400 --> 01:11:25.960]   where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us,
[01:11:25.960 --> 01:11:28.700]   having become a high priest forever,
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:31.740]   according to the order of Melchizedek.
[01:11:31.740 --> 01:11:35.640]   Heavenly Father, help us Lord God to remain sober,
[01:11:35.640 --> 01:11:37.920]   to be anchored in Christ,
[01:11:37.920 --> 01:11:40.440]   knowing Father God that this world will pass away,
[01:11:40.440 --> 01:11:42.680]   that no matter how much we covet,
[01:11:42.680 --> 01:11:44.880]   no matter how much we desire,
[01:11:44.880 --> 01:11:46.960]   that at the end of the day, Father God,
[01:11:46.960 --> 01:11:49.760]   that only the things that are eternal that matters,
[01:11:49.760 --> 01:11:53.000]   help us Lord this week to fix our eyes upon Christ,
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:55.520]   to be anchored in him and not to drift,
[01:11:55.520 --> 01:11:58.360]   that not only us, but all that is around us,
[01:11:58.360 --> 01:12:01.180]   all the people Lord God that you have placed in our lives,
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:03.000]   that they too will know
[01:12:03.000 --> 01:12:05.960]   that there is hope in the name of Jesus Christ.
[01:12:05.960 --> 01:12:08.800]   May your name be magnified wherever you send us this week.
[01:12:08.800 --> 01:12:10.780]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
