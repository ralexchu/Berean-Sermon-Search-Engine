[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:13.480]   Romans chapter 8, 12-17, reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:13.480 --> 00:00:18.040]   So then brothers, we are debtors not to the flesh to live according to the flesh.
[00:00:18.040 --> 00:00:21.920]   For if you live according to the flesh, you will die, but if by the Spirit you put to
[00:00:21.920 --> 00:00:24.600]   death the deeds of the body, you will live.
[00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:27.360]   For all who are led by the Spirit of God are sons of God.
[00:00:27.360 --> 00:00:31.640]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:35.440]   the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, Abba, Father.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:39.480]   The Spirit himself bears witness with our spirit that we are children of God.
[00:00:39.480 --> 00:00:43.400]   And if children, then heirs, heirs of God and fellow heirs with Christ, provided we
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:47.520]   suffer with him in order that we may also be glorified with him.
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.920]   Let's pray.
[00:00:50.920 --> 00:00:57.400]   Heavenly Father, you truly are a God worthy of all our praise.
[00:00:57.400 --> 00:00:59.240]   We thank you for your graciousness.
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.720]   We thank you for your patience.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:05.640]   We thank you for the gift of salvation and the Holy Spirit.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:11.960]   Help us, Lord God, as we search your word that you would teach, remind, encourage, rebuke,
[00:01:11.960 --> 00:01:14.520]   challenge, and lead us.
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:17.720]   For we are weak in understanding.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:19.200]   We pray your Holy Spirit would guide.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:23.480]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:27.320]   As you guys know, I've been giving you updates on what's been happening to the building,
[00:01:27.320 --> 00:01:28.320]   our new building.
[00:01:28.320 --> 00:01:29.880]   We're kind of at the tail end.
[00:01:29.880 --> 00:01:32.720]   We have maybe a month or two months more.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:34.680]   We have a lot of little things to go.
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.040]   In the last maybe about two to three weeks, one, in order to speed up the process and
[00:01:40.040 --> 00:01:45.840]   maybe even save a little bit of money, we've actually hired some handymen, so people that
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:49.600]   I've gotten to know through using them here.
[00:01:49.600 --> 00:01:53.680]   I contacted one of the guys that we use to do some construction on that end.
[00:01:53.680 --> 00:01:58.800]   I asked him if he can bring some of his friends to do some work because we had some things
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:01:59.800]   to do.
[00:01:59.800 --> 00:02:00.800]   We had some digging.
[00:02:00.800 --> 00:02:04.360]   We had some throwing away trash and cleanup, a lot of just physical labor.
[00:02:04.360 --> 00:02:10.160]   A couple weeks ago, the guy that I contacted brought some of his friends.
[00:02:10.160 --> 00:02:14.120]   When he brought some of his friends, I was just kind of taking it back initially because
[00:02:14.120 --> 00:02:17.840]   the youngest of the three guys that he brought was my age.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.000]   Then the next guy was in his mid-50s.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:23.200]   The next older guy was 75.
[00:02:23.200 --> 00:02:25.200]   He showed up and saying, "We're ready to work."
[00:02:25.200 --> 00:02:26.200]   I'm like, "Okay."
[00:02:26.200 --> 00:02:30.360]   It's already too late now.
[00:02:30.360 --> 00:02:31.840]   They started working.
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:38.920]   Again, every once in a while, you meet people who just kind of live in a completely different
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.400]   world even though we're living in Orange County together, but they live in a completely different
[00:02:43.400 --> 00:02:44.400]   world.
[00:02:44.400 --> 00:02:45.880]   They work their tail off.
[00:02:45.880 --> 00:02:48.760]   They work eight hours just digging, like literally digging.
[00:02:48.760 --> 00:02:53.880]   If you've ever dug dirt before, that's probably one of the hardest things to do physically.
[00:02:53.880 --> 00:02:57.120]   It's just eight hours of dirt digging.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:02:58.880]   I felt bad.
[00:02:58.880 --> 00:03:00.280]   I was there watching them.
[00:03:00.280 --> 00:03:02.480]   I kind of had to help out a little bit.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:07.240]   Last two weeks, we've been kind of around the building and helping out this and that.
[00:03:07.240 --> 00:03:13.360]   At the end of the night, a couple weeks ago, the guy told me because most of the guys don't
[00:03:13.360 --> 00:03:15.440]   speak English well.
[00:03:15.440 --> 00:03:21.600]   The guy that I contacted, he was telling me at the end of the night, and he said ... He
[00:03:21.600 --> 00:03:23.920]   was introducing each one of them to me.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:26.880]   He said, "Well, this guy is 75 years old."
[00:03:26.880 --> 00:03:28.600]   I was like, "Wow, 75.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:30.240]   This guy works so hard.
[00:03:30.240 --> 00:03:34.120]   I can't believe he's able to have that kind of stamina."
[00:03:34.120 --> 00:03:36.400]   Then he said, "Well, here's this other guy.
[00:03:36.400 --> 00:03:39.000]   He's 55 years old, and he has cancer."
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:42.720]   I thought he was kidding.
[00:03:42.720 --> 00:03:43.720]   He has no hair.
[00:03:43.720 --> 00:03:44.720]   He was completely bald.
[00:03:44.720 --> 00:03:48.640]   He said the reason why he doesn't have hair is because he's in the middle of chemo.
[00:03:48.640 --> 00:03:51.000]   I said, "What?"
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:55.040]   Not only are they old, this guy has cancer.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.880]   He literally dug eight hours straight nonstop.
[00:03:58.880 --> 00:04:03.440]   They've been working at the building for the last two weeks, just kind of picking up things
[00:04:03.440 --> 00:04:07.960]   and doing some ... Again, this is heavy stuff, the heavy stuff that they're doing.
[00:04:07.960 --> 00:04:13.480]   Especially these two guys, they're all hard workers, but especially two guys, every time
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:19.400]   I come in, I always kind of feel bad, because they're not ... We're giving them more money
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:24.160]   than they asked for, but it's not anywhere near what they deserve.
[00:04:24.160 --> 00:04:28.760]   I've been trying to talk to them and get to know them to find out what's going on, but
[00:04:28.760 --> 00:04:35.720]   this guy, he had chemo this Monday, and so he wanted to come to work, but he had to rest
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:38.880]   because he was knocked down by chemo, but as soon as he felt better, he came back to
[00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.280]   work on Thursday, asking for more work.
[00:04:42.280 --> 00:04:44.840]   Then I said, "Man, you need to take a break.
[00:04:44.840 --> 00:04:48.640]   He just had chemo on Monday, and then I was at the building yesterday, and he was at the
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:54.120]   building yesterday, because a guy that we hired to do some drywalling hired him to come
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   and help him."
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:05:00.760]   He was there all day Saturday, and he was asking me as I was leaving, "Hey, Peter, can
[00:05:00.760 --> 00:05:02.640]   I come on Monday?"
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:03.640]   He's going to be there on Monday.
[00:05:03.640 --> 00:05:07.920]   If you want to come check him out, you come to church on Monday.
[00:05:07.920 --> 00:05:14.160]   I'm not exaggerating, but being around these guys just kind of put things in perspective,
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:19.600]   because last month or two has been pretty crazy.
[00:05:19.600 --> 00:05:24.040]   A lot of things ... You're not going to understand, but a lot of things, because we're at the
[00:05:24.040 --> 00:05:25.040]   tail end.
[00:05:25.040 --> 00:05:26.040]   There's a lot of things that need to get done.
[00:05:26.040 --> 00:05:29.560]   The inspector's coming the next day, so we're in a hurry, and there's a lot of grumbling
[00:05:29.560 --> 00:05:34.840]   in my heart, because the architect and the structural engineer didn't do the drawings
[00:05:34.840 --> 00:05:37.400]   correctly, and we're wasting a lot of time and money.
[00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:43.640]   Then I meet these guys, and I felt bad, so one day while they were working, I went there
[00:05:43.640 --> 00:05:45.840]   and said, "Man, this is a lot of work, huh?"
[00:05:45.840 --> 00:05:48.360]   One of the guys looked at me, and he said, "Easy money."
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:50.360]   I said, "Easy money?"
[00:05:50.360 --> 00:05:52.360]   That's what he said.
[00:05:52.360 --> 00:05:56.600]   It's like, "Wow, easy money after all of that?"
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:03.880]   Again, I share this story because every single one of us are tremendously blessed, even just
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:05.520]   physically.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:06.520]   You have good jobs.
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:08.940]   You have a place to live.
[00:06:08.940 --> 00:06:14.520]   How many of you would spend eight hours digging dirt for a hundred bucks?
[00:06:14.520 --> 00:06:19.520]   But to them, and at the end of the day, I'll say, "Man, is this even worth it?"
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.600]   But at the end of the day, every single day, they're begging me, "Can I come back tomorrow?
[00:06:22.600 --> 00:06:24.760]   Can I come back tomorrow?"
[00:06:24.760 --> 00:06:30.600]   But it kind of puts things in perspective for me that everything that I grumble about
[00:06:30.600 --> 00:06:34.800]   in my heart, a lot of times, is just so trivial.
[00:06:34.800 --> 00:06:36.320]   To me, these are men.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.920]   These are people who lived life and just value what needs to be valued.
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:48.120]   But so much of things that we complain about and we grumble about are so trivial in light
[00:06:48.120 --> 00:06:50.840]   of just everything else.
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:55.680]   I share this story because as Christians, not only are we physically blessed, but as
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:01.560]   Christians, Paul's been reminding us that we have the Holy Spirit.
[00:07:01.560 --> 00:07:05.520]   The distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian is we have the Spirit of God
[00:07:05.520 --> 00:07:09.260]   who indwelt us, who's living in us.
[00:07:09.260 --> 00:07:15.480]   And sometimes we forget just the privilege that we have and what a blessing that we have,
[00:07:15.480 --> 00:07:22.160]   that we've been targeted by the God of this universe to be loved in this specific way
[00:07:22.160 --> 00:07:27.200]   that he sent his only begotten Son to save us.
[00:07:27.200 --> 00:07:32.760]   This morning, and we're looking at this text, Paul reminds us of four things in this text
[00:07:32.760 --> 00:07:37.880]   that I want to share with you as we're looking at this text, that the Holy Spirit, what the
[00:07:37.880 --> 00:07:41.000]   Holy Spirit means for us as Christians.
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:42.920]   So let's jump right in.
[00:07:42.920 --> 00:07:49.000]   First thing he says in verse 14, he says, "For all who are led by the Spirit of God
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:50.360]   are sons of God."
[00:07:50.360 --> 00:07:56.440]   So the first thing that he is to us is the Holy Spirit is the identifying mark of a Christian.
[00:07:56.440 --> 00:08:00.760]   The Holy Spirit is the identifying mark of a Christian.
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:05.920]   He doesn't say that some Christians have the Holy Spirit and some Christians don't.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:09.880]   There are certain degrees given to certain people and certain people not.
[00:08:09.880 --> 00:08:14.480]   The distinguishing mark between a Christian and a non-Christian is the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:14.480 --> 00:08:17.600]   Either you have him or you don't have him.
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:22.200]   There is no Christian identified in the scripture that does not have the Holy Spirit.
[00:08:22.200 --> 00:08:30.840]   If the Holy Spirit is not making a dwelling in you, then you would not be a Christian.
[00:08:30.840 --> 00:08:36.160]   So he says in verse 14, "If you are led by the Holy Spirit, you are a Christian.
[00:08:36.160 --> 00:08:38.520]   You are a child of God."
[00:08:38.520 --> 00:08:42.160]   We see the same thing emphasized by Paul in Galatians 5.16.
[00:08:42.160 --> 00:08:47.520]   He says, "But I say, walk by the Spirit and you will not gratify the desires of the flesh.
[00:08:47.520 --> 00:08:51.320]   For the desires of the flesh are against the Spirit and the desires of the Spirit are against
[00:08:51.320 --> 00:08:52.400]   the flesh.
[00:08:52.400 --> 00:08:56.360]   For these are opposed to each other to keep you from doing the things that you want to
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.360]   do."
[00:08:57.360 --> 00:09:04.080]   He says the mark of a Christian is the Holy Spirit restrains you from your flesh.
[00:09:04.080 --> 00:09:08.360]   The Holy Spirit leads you away from the things that are harmful.
[00:09:08.360 --> 00:09:11.000]   He said they are diametrically opposed to each other.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:15.080]   So an individual cannot, either you are being led by the Spirit or you are being led by
[00:09:15.080 --> 00:09:16.080]   the flesh.
[00:09:16.080 --> 00:09:18.080]   But you can't have both.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:24.360]   You know, we often hear how the church is hypocritical and how there's backbiting and
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:29.080]   slander and let's be honest, all of that to a certain degree is true.
[00:09:29.080 --> 00:09:31.360]   Because we have sin dwelling in us.
[00:09:31.360 --> 00:09:32.760]   There's divisions in the church.
[00:09:32.760 --> 00:09:36.220]   We have opinions that we don't agree with one another.
[00:09:36.220 --> 00:09:37.480]   And sometimes it can get nasty.
[00:09:37.480 --> 00:09:38.480]   And I've seen it.
[00:09:38.480 --> 00:09:42.240]   You know, I've been in, I've grown up in the church.
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:44.800]   I've seen police officers show up at the church.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:46.520]   I've seen elders fighting.
[00:09:46.520 --> 00:09:49.280]   So I've seen some ugly things in the church.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.600]   And as bad as we may say some certain things that we have seen in the church, the difference
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:10:01.120]   between the community and the church and outside the church is that a church filled with genuine
[00:10:01.120 --> 00:10:07.440]   believers, no matter how bad it may get, is restrained sin.
[00:10:07.440 --> 00:10:09.760]   It's restrained sin.
[00:10:09.760 --> 00:10:13.960]   If you've ever worked in a workforce, which I know a lot of you do, and you've ever been
[00:10:13.960 --> 00:10:19.240]   in a situation where somebody is out to slander you, you've offended them in some way, and
[00:10:19.240 --> 00:10:21.520]   now they're going to ruin you.
[00:10:21.520 --> 00:10:25.160]   And it's unrestrained because there's nothing holding them back.
[00:10:25.160 --> 00:10:27.280]   There's nothing inside of them saying like, "Oh, I feel bad.
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:28.280]   I shouldn't do this."
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:30.220]   No, they're going to do this until you grovel.
[00:10:30.220 --> 00:10:33.020]   Look at, look at our presidential campaign.
[00:10:33.020 --> 00:10:37.840]   Look at the non-Christians and how they fight and how they distort the truth and say something
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:43.600]   that somebody said and twisted it all for the purpose of, for their own gain.
[00:10:43.600 --> 00:10:49.360]   Now, I know those of you who are new to the political arena may have been shocked by the
[00:10:49.360 --> 00:10:52.960]   verbiage and how they're willing to go after their children, their wives, their heritage.
[00:10:52.960 --> 00:10:56.000]   I mean, their hairstyle, their womanhood, man.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:11:00.400]   I mean, they'll go after everything, whatever it takes for them to get what they want.
[00:11:00.400 --> 00:11:04.920]   See, that's the identifying mark of a non-Christian.
[00:11:04.920 --> 00:11:07.280]   A non-Christian is not restrained by the Holy Spirit.
[00:11:07.280 --> 00:11:10.000]   The Holy Spirit restrains Christians.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:15.080]   But what does it mean to be led by the Spirit other than just being restrained in the flesh?
[00:11:15.080 --> 00:11:20.840]   Because a lot of times we use the word "led" as in this supernatural, you know, where it's
[00:11:20.840 --> 00:11:24.840]   like, "Oh, you know, God spoke to me last night and He's leading me to do this.
[00:11:24.840 --> 00:11:26.280]   God led me to go to Irvine.
[00:11:26.280 --> 00:11:28.720]   Oh, God led me to this, to this job."
[00:11:28.720 --> 00:11:32.080]   And we use the term kind of very, you know, mystically.
[00:11:32.080 --> 00:11:37.680]   And it sounds good, but in actual practice, like, what does that mean?
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:42.480]   In fact, in Christian dating, maybe some of you have been a target of this mystical, you
[00:11:42.480 --> 00:11:46.000]   know, "God led me to you."
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:48.080]   You know, "God's leading me not to you."
[00:11:48.080 --> 00:11:51.040]   You know?
[00:11:51.040 --> 00:11:56.960]   And we make certain things like make it mystical and godly, but in reality, you just don't
[00:11:56.960 --> 00:12:00.080]   like that person.
[00:12:00.080 --> 00:12:01.920]   What does it mean to be led by the Spirit?
[00:12:01.920 --> 00:12:07.800]   Well, he explains in verse 18 in Galatians chapter 5, "But if you are led by the Spirit,
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:09.080]   you are not under the law."
[00:12:09.080 --> 00:12:14.000]   And then he describes an individual who's being led by the flesh.
[00:12:14.000 --> 00:12:15.800]   Now the works of the flesh are evident.
[00:12:15.800 --> 00:12:21.880]   Sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy, fits of
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:28.160]   anger, rivalries, dissension, divisions, envy, drunkenness, orgies, and things like these.
[00:12:28.160 --> 00:12:32.200]   I warn you, as I warned you before, that those who do such things will not inherit the kingdom
[00:12:32.200 --> 00:12:34.440]   of God.
[00:12:34.440 --> 00:12:38.480]   He's not saying that an individual who's being led by the Spirit, led by the flesh, that
[00:12:38.480 --> 00:12:42.360]   all of these things are going to be true to everyone.
[00:12:42.360 --> 00:12:47.080]   Somebody who's being led by the flesh may not have all of these qualities, but an individual
[00:12:47.080 --> 00:12:52.280]   who's led by the flesh is an individual who has given in to these impulses.
[00:12:52.280 --> 00:12:57.120]   And your whole life and trajectory is being led by these things.
[00:12:57.120 --> 00:13:02.120]   Even in the church, you can come to church and be completely led by the flesh.
[00:13:02.120 --> 00:13:06.520]   And that's why sometimes the church can be ruined if you have leaders who are being led
[00:13:06.520 --> 00:13:07.520]   by the flesh.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.360]   Let me give you an example.
[00:13:10.360 --> 00:13:14.720]   You know, there are situations where you're perfectly content with your life and the things
[00:13:14.720 --> 00:13:18.960]   that God has given you until you go to someone else's house, and all of a sudden it's not
[00:13:18.960 --> 00:13:20.120]   enough.
[00:13:20.120 --> 00:13:23.720]   The income that you're making was good enough until you start talking about what other people
[00:13:23.720 --> 00:13:26.080]   are making, and all of a sudden it's not enough.
[00:13:26.080 --> 00:13:30.440]   And then here's this rivalry and envy and competition that comes into your heart, and
[00:13:30.440 --> 00:13:32.800]   then you give in to that.
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:38.520]   And so once you give in, now the trajectory of your life is to have what they have.
[00:13:38.520 --> 00:13:42.580]   So now your flesh is leading you and not the Spirit.
[00:13:42.580 --> 00:13:48.360]   You can have contention in the church and somebody said something that offended you,
[00:13:48.360 --> 00:13:53.920]   and your heart is angered, and there's bitterness, and you give in to that.
[00:13:53.920 --> 00:13:55.760]   And then now the things are coming out of your mouth.
[00:13:55.760 --> 00:13:59.760]   You're deliberately slandering people, deliberately being divisive.
[00:13:59.760 --> 00:14:02.280]   And so now you're being led by the flesh.
[00:14:02.280 --> 00:14:06.840]   See, that's a description that is given to us by Galatians chapter 5.
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:10.800]   An individual who's being led by the flesh is somebody who will wear the flesh that is
[00:14:10.800 --> 00:14:13.440]   against the Spirit, and you've given in to it.
[00:14:13.440 --> 00:14:19.000]   Now you're making decisions and deliberately doing things to satisfy your flesh.
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:23.960]   But in contrast, in verse 22, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love."
[00:14:23.960 --> 00:14:27.680]   Now I'm going to stop right there with the word "love," because love really encompasses
[00:14:27.680 --> 00:14:30.280]   every other character that he's about to mention.
[00:14:30.280 --> 00:14:34.960]   Joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness, faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:14:34.960 --> 00:14:37.360]   Against these things there is no law.
[00:14:37.360 --> 00:14:41.200]   But the word "love" really encompasses all of it.
[00:14:41.200 --> 00:14:48.280]   An individual who's being led by love, led by the Spirit and not by the flesh, you will
[00:14:48.280 --> 00:14:53.840]   experience the same kind of slander, same kind of divisions, same kind of sinfulness
[00:14:53.840 --> 00:14:55.680]   that may come against you.
[00:14:55.680 --> 00:15:00.540]   But instead of giving in to your flesh, you choose to love, because the Holy Spirit is
[00:15:00.540 --> 00:15:02.280]   leading you.
[00:15:02.280 --> 00:15:06.800]   The Holy Spirit is compelling you to live in love.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:13.920]   So an individual who is driving, whose trajectory of life is being driven by the Spirit of God,
[00:15:13.920 --> 00:15:20.160]   is going to be pursuing, actively pursuing, love, joy, patience, kindness, goodness, and
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:22.680]   faithfulness, and so on.
[00:15:22.680 --> 00:15:27.080]   So this being led by the Spirit, at least the way that the Bible describes it, isn't
[00:15:27.080 --> 00:15:33.280]   just wait there until the Holy Spirit speaks to you so that you can go.
[00:15:33.280 --> 00:15:34.940]   Where is the Holy Spirit leading you?
[00:15:34.940 --> 00:15:35.940]   What job should you get?
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:39.720]   Is the Holy Spirit leading you as to what wife or husband that you must get?
[00:15:39.720 --> 00:15:42.240]   That's not what we see in Scripture.
[00:15:42.240 --> 00:15:48.040]   Being led by your flesh is basically giving in to your fleshly impulses, whether it may
[00:15:48.040 --> 00:15:55.000]   be lust, or envy, competition, your pride, your ego, your anger, your bitterness, you've
[00:15:55.000 --> 00:15:59.080]   given in to that, and now you're pursuing this.
[00:15:59.080 --> 00:16:00.520]   And you're justifying it.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:03.600]   And you're a man or woman being led by the flesh.
[00:16:03.600 --> 00:16:08.880]   But one who is led by the Spirit, the Word of God, is constantly convicting you against
[00:16:08.880 --> 00:16:11.560]   the things that you desire.
[00:16:11.560 --> 00:16:14.600]   Against the things that are contrary to the things that you desire of your flesh.
[00:16:14.600 --> 00:16:18.040]   But the Spirit of God is leading you in another direction.
[00:16:18.040 --> 00:16:21.240]   But when He says you are being led by the Spirit, there's another thing that we need
[00:16:21.240 --> 00:16:22.620]   to remember.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:27.720]   The Bible describes Christians being led by the Spirit because we haven't arrived yet.
[00:16:27.720 --> 00:16:31.260]   Just in case somebody is sitting here thinking, "Well, you know, I still struggle.
[00:16:31.260 --> 00:16:34.000]   My flesh is so strong."
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   But the reason why we're being led is because we're not there.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:40.080]   If you are there, there's no need to be led.
[00:16:40.080 --> 00:16:44.320]   To be led means the Holy Spirit is taking you somewhere.
[00:16:44.320 --> 00:16:45.320]   And there's a reason.
[00:16:45.320 --> 00:16:51.360]   I know that 1 Corinthians 13.10 is often used to talk about by the cessationists, or people
[00:16:51.360 --> 00:16:58.640]   who don't believe in the spiritual gifts, that the Word of God came and so the miracle
[00:16:58.640 --> 00:17:00.600]   of gifts is not necessary.
[00:17:00.600 --> 00:17:04.160]   But in 1 Corinthians 13.10, when it says, "When the perfect comes, the imperfect shall
[00:17:04.160 --> 00:17:05.600]   pass away."
[00:17:05.600 --> 00:17:10.040]   The word perfect, teleos, basically means to take something that was intended for a
[00:17:10.040 --> 00:17:14.040]   certain purpose and take it to completion.
[00:17:14.040 --> 00:17:15.360]   To bring it to final completion.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:19.100]   What God intended in salvation, that He would take it to completion.
[00:17:19.100 --> 00:17:22.920]   So sometimes people translate that as Jesus Himself, His work.
[00:17:22.920 --> 00:17:28.720]   Or oftentimes it's translated as our salvation and sanctification itself.
[00:17:28.720 --> 00:17:32.480]   But the word basically means to take something to its completion.
[00:17:32.480 --> 00:17:35.080]   And that's what the Holy Spirit is doing.
[00:17:35.080 --> 00:17:37.280]   That's the mark of a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:41.760]   A Christian is somebody who is being led by the Holy Spirit, not by the flesh, to bring
[00:17:41.760 --> 00:17:44.200]   them to completion.
[00:17:44.200 --> 00:17:46.600]   What God intended in salvation.
[00:17:46.600 --> 00:17:50.000]   Not simply so, "Oh, you're not going to hell and work done."
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:56.040]   No, "He who began a good work in you, to complete it until the day of Christ."
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:59.700]   That's how the Bible describes the ministry of the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:59.700 --> 00:18:05.380]   The Holy Spirit is the identifying, clear identifying mark of a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:18:05.380 --> 00:18:11.640]   The second thing that the Holy Spirit does, the Holy Spirit delivers us.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:15.280]   The Holy Spirit, number one, the Holy Spirit identifies us.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:20.460]   Number two, the Holy Spirit delivers us from enslavement, from fear, to freedom as sons
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:21.460]   of God.
[00:18:21.460 --> 00:18:22.960]   In Romans 8, 15.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:27.120]   "For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:18:27.120 --> 00:18:29.440]   the spirit of adoption as sons."
[00:18:29.440 --> 00:18:34.860]   You notice how He contrasts enslavement and fear?
[00:18:34.860 --> 00:18:37.200]   And what's the deliverance for?
[00:18:37.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   Adoption.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:44.040]   He doesn't just say, "We've been delivered from enslavement of sin and fear."
[00:18:44.040 --> 00:18:45.400]   He doesn't just stop there.
[00:18:45.400 --> 00:18:51.040]   He said, "We've been delivered from that, and instead of fear, we have what?"
[00:18:51.040 --> 00:18:55.760]   The contrasting statement that He makes is that we are adopted children of God, by which
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.320]   we cry out, "Abba, Father."
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:04.360]   Hebrews chapter 2, 14, it says, "Since therefore the children share in the flesh and blood,
[00:19:04.360 --> 00:19:06.920]   He Himself likewise partook in the same things."
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:07.920]   Talking about Jesus.
[00:19:07.920 --> 00:19:12.560]   "That through death He might destroy the one who has the power of death, that is the devil,
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:19.160]   and deliver all those who through fear of death were subject to lifelong slavery."
[00:19:19.160 --> 00:19:24.240]   So when He says He's delivered us from fear of death, like how many of you don't fear
[00:19:24.240 --> 00:19:25.240]   death?
[00:19:25.240 --> 00:19:26.760]   I don't fear death.
[00:19:26.760 --> 00:19:32.240]   Of course, we don't fear what happens after death, but I think all of us fear death itself,
[00:19:32.240 --> 00:19:35.960]   that moment where God calls us to cross over.
[00:19:35.960 --> 00:19:40.200]   So when He's talking about fear of death, He's not talking about the actual event of
[00:19:40.200 --> 00:19:41.520]   dying.
[00:19:41.520 --> 00:19:44.600]   He's talking about the consequence of what happens after you die.
[00:19:44.600 --> 00:19:49.200]   He's talking about the judgment, and that's what He clearly says in Hebrews.
[00:19:49.200 --> 00:19:50.360]   The fear of judgment.
[00:19:50.360 --> 00:19:55.640]   We've been delivered from the fear of judgment, but He doesn't leave us there.
[00:19:55.640 --> 00:20:00.280]   And that's, again, and I think that's the problem that we have in our generation, is
[00:20:00.280 --> 00:20:06.260]   that the Gospel has been preached to deliver us from the penalty of sin, not recognizing
[00:20:06.260 --> 00:20:12.080]   the whole purpose of deliverance was to make us a child of God.
[00:20:12.080 --> 00:20:16.480]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 54, 56, "Death is swallowed up in victory.
[00:20:16.480 --> 00:20:18.440]   O death, where is your victory?
[00:20:18.440 --> 00:20:19.440]   Death where is your sting?
[00:20:19.440 --> 00:20:23.600]   The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law."
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:25.600]   That we are no longer under the law.
[00:20:25.600 --> 00:20:33.220]   Law no longer judges us or condemns us, but we are adopted children of God.
[00:20:33.220 --> 00:20:36.780]   You know, obviously today we identify Christian and non-Christian.
[00:20:36.780 --> 00:20:41.800]   The term Christian, right, has become such a generic term.
[00:20:41.800 --> 00:20:48.560]   I would say, at least in the last presidential election, I actively followed presidential
[00:20:48.560 --> 00:20:51.040]   elections starting from Reagan.
[00:20:51.040 --> 00:20:55.140]   Not that, you know, I was born before then, but where I was old enough where I actually
[00:20:55.140 --> 00:20:57.680]   knew what was going on was from Reagan.
[00:20:57.680 --> 00:21:04.100]   And every president, every president and every president nominee has always claimed
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.900]   to be Christian.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.220]   Always.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:10.520]   Not only the ones who are elected, but the ones competing, not only Republicans, but
[00:21:10.520 --> 00:21:11.520]   Democrats alike.
[00:21:11.520 --> 00:21:15.560]   I can't think, I mean, you can correct me if I'm, you know, I'm sure you can think
[00:21:15.560 --> 00:21:21.200]   of one or two people, but I can't think of a single person who ran for presidency
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:23.460]   who didn't say that they were a Christian.
[00:21:23.460 --> 00:21:28.840]   And I can honestly tell you that I can only identify maybe about four people that I can
[00:21:28.840 --> 00:21:33.580]   say they were actual Christians out of maybe 20, 30 people that I can remember.
[00:21:33.580 --> 00:21:38.800]   Because in a nominal Christian nation, in a post-Christian culture, if you don't identify
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.400]   as a Christian, you can't get elected.
[00:21:42.400 --> 00:21:46.800]   So you may be pagan in every other way, but in public office, you have to be a Christian,
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:48.900]   at least be marked as a Christian.
[00:21:48.900 --> 00:21:53.500]   So in our generation, the term Christian has become so generic.
[00:21:53.500 --> 00:21:57.320]   When somebody says they're Christian, we don't know what that means.
[00:21:57.320 --> 00:22:02.040]   In fact, this very week I had a conversation, because I'm at the new building a lot, and
[00:22:02.040 --> 00:22:08.600]   there's a couple of workers who were doing the fire alarm for us, and very lively guys,
[00:22:08.600 --> 00:22:10.480]   you know, using foul language all the time.
[00:22:10.480 --> 00:22:12.800]   And I try to get to know them a little bit better.
[00:22:12.800 --> 00:22:16.060]   And so one day they were out there a little bit later, and we were the only ones there.
[00:22:16.060 --> 00:22:18.620]   So I tried to share the gospel with them.
[00:22:18.620 --> 00:22:21.920]   And I told them, "Hey, this is a church, and I'm the pastor."
[00:22:21.920 --> 00:22:23.800]   And so the conversation started.
[00:22:23.800 --> 00:22:24.800]   And I said, "Are you a Christian?"
[00:22:24.800 --> 00:22:27.800]   And they said, "Yes, we're Christian."
[00:22:27.800 --> 00:22:29.840]   So that was like a 15-second pause.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:32.840]   I was like, "What should I say?
[00:22:32.840 --> 00:22:33.840]   I don't think so."
[00:22:33.840 --> 00:22:34.840]   But it was interesting.
[00:22:34.840 --> 00:22:39.480]   And they were saying, "Yeah, my mom's a Christian, and somebody's a Christian."
[00:22:39.480 --> 00:22:40.840]   And so they identify as Christians.
[00:22:40.840 --> 00:22:42.240]   So I said, "What makes you a Christian?"
[00:22:42.240 --> 00:22:44.080]   They said, "Oh, my mom's a Christian."
[00:22:44.080 --> 00:22:47.080]   So I said, "Are you a Christian because you're a Christian, or are you a Christian because
[00:22:47.080 --> 00:22:48.080]   you were born a Christian?"
[00:22:48.080 --> 00:22:49.080]   They said, "Oh, I was born a Christian.
[00:22:49.080 --> 00:22:50.880]   Isn't that how you're a Christian?"
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:52.760]   So I was able to have this conversation.
[00:22:52.760 --> 00:22:57.880]   And what was interesting to me is in the context of this conversation, one of the guys asked,
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:23:01.720]   because they've been working putting fire alarms in every single room.
[00:23:01.720 --> 00:23:05.920]   And one of the rooms that they were working on for, I don't know, it wasn't me, but somebody
[00:23:05.920 --> 00:23:08.360]   told them that it was the cry room.
[00:23:08.360 --> 00:23:11.200]   You know, some of you guys who went to that building, you saw we have a large cry room
[00:23:11.200 --> 00:23:12.280]   back there.
[00:23:12.280 --> 00:23:15.360]   And so the whole time he was working, he couldn't figure out what that was.
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:17.840]   So he asked me, "What is that?"
[00:23:17.840 --> 00:23:19.640]   I'm like, "People come to cry?
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   What is that?"
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640]   Right?
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:23.720]   So he was asking me that question.
[00:23:23.720 --> 00:23:29.080]   And so before I could even answer, the other guy standing next to him was trying to answer
[00:23:29.080 --> 00:23:30.080]   him.
[00:23:30.080 --> 00:23:32.240]   I said, "Yeah."
[00:23:32.240 --> 00:23:35.160]   People come, and that's where they cry.
[00:23:35.160 --> 00:23:38.400]   So the whole time they're having this conversation, I'm just sitting there listening to this.
[00:23:38.400 --> 00:23:39.720]   Like, "People come to cry here?"
[00:23:39.720 --> 00:23:40.720]   I said, "Yeah.
[00:23:40.720 --> 00:23:41.720]   They come.
[00:23:41.720 --> 00:23:43.040]   They just come, and they go to that room.
[00:23:43.040 --> 00:23:45.120]   If they want to cry, they go to that room."
[00:23:45.120 --> 00:23:46.120]   And the guy said, "Yeah.
[00:23:46.120 --> 00:23:47.120]   Yeah."
[00:23:47.120 --> 00:23:48.680]   So I'm just listening to this.
[00:23:48.680 --> 00:23:50.080]   "When can I correct these guys?
[00:23:50.080 --> 00:23:51.840]   I just wanted to see how far they went."
[00:23:51.840 --> 00:23:52.840]   You know?
[00:23:52.840 --> 00:23:56.800]   So eventually I came in and said, "Oh, it's for parents with small children.
[00:23:56.800 --> 00:23:59.240]   So when they cry, they can take them into that room."
[00:23:59.240 --> 00:24:02.440]   So I thought when I told them that, they would say, "Oh, that's what they meant."
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.360]   But even like, "So when babies cry, they go into that room?"
[00:24:06.360 --> 00:24:08.520]   It's like, "Yes.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:09.520]   That's where they go."
[00:24:09.520 --> 00:24:10.520]   You know?
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:16.280]   So obviously, you know, these guys have never been to church, but they identify as Christians.
[00:24:16.280 --> 00:24:17.400]   And I'm sure you know, too.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:20.000]   You have coworkers or classmates.
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:21.920]   You know, the term Christian has been thrown around.
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:24.080]   We don't really know what that means.
[00:24:24.080 --> 00:24:25.080]   You know?
[00:24:25.080 --> 00:24:26.440]   So they go, "Oh, you're an evangelical Christian."
[00:24:26.440 --> 00:24:30.040]   But now, even the term evangelical has been watered down, and you don't know what that
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.840]   means either.
[00:24:31.840 --> 00:24:36.120]   The term Christian that was given to us was a derogatory term.
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.080]   It was people who hated Christians, who were persecuting Christians in the early church
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:43.240]   era, saying, "Oh, those are little Christs."
[00:24:43.240 --> 00:24:44.240]   People were following.
[00:24:44.240 --> 00:24:45.480]   So that's where the term Christian came from.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.960]   It wasn't a term that Christians embraced.
[00:24:47.960 --> 00:24:54.240]   The earliest term that was given to us that we may have embraced is the word "the way."
[00:24:54.240 --> 00:24:58.560]   And that was first used in the Church of Antioch, the first Gentile church.
[00:24:58.560 --> 00:25:00.280]   They were called "the way."
[00:25:00.280 --> 00:25:01.280]   And we can understand why.
[00:25:01.280 --> 00:25:04.960]   And we say, "Jesus is the way and the truth and the life."
[00:25:04.960 --> 00:25:13.800]   But when you read the Scripture, and predominantly how God addresses us is His children.
[00:25:13.800 --> 00:25:19.680]   The way that the Bible describes us is children of God, sons of God, daughters of God.
[00:25:19.680 --> 00:25:24.400]   You know, and I was thinking as I was meditating on this, how much if we started to think of
[00:25:24.400 --> 00:25:29.000]   ourselves and addressing ourselves as children of God, sons of God.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:31.440]   I'm a son of God.
[00:25:31.440 --> 00:25:37.120]   How much of that would affect, maybe, the way that we view ourselves and our salvation?
[00:25:37.120 --> 00:25:41.000]   And I think part of the reason, I'm not saying all the reason, but part of the reason why
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:47.920]   there is this ambiguity after salvation of what to do with our Christian lives is because
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:48.920]   of that.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:25:54.760]   Where we talked about deliverance from sin, and then not understand what that deliverance
[00:25:54.760 --> 00:25:57.000]   was for.
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:01.280]   Was that whole purpose of salvation was not simply to get us away from the penalty of
[00:26:01.280 --> 00:26:04.600]   sin, it's so that we may become children of God.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:08.040]   Because that's what was lost at the fall.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:11.120]   Salvation from the author of life.
[00:26:11.120 --> 00:26:17.720]   So the scripture tells us that the purpose of the Holy Spirit is to confirm, is to confirm
[00:26:17.720 --> 00:26:22.360]   and to deliver us and make us His children.
[00:26:22.360 --> 00:26:27.240]   The scripture says in this passage that we have become adopted children of God.
[00:26:27.240 --> 00:26:32.080]   Even the term adoption, we have to make sure that we understand it the way they understood
[00:26:32.080 --> 00:26:33.080]   it.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:37.800]   In our generation, when we talk about adoption, we're talking about maybe mercy.
[00:26:37.800 --> 00:26:41.720]   You know, you go to some of the poor countries or something happens and this child needs
[00:26:41.720 --> 00:26:44.520]   a home, so you decide to show compassion.
[00:26:44.520 --> 00:26:48.500]   So adoption has become an act of ministry in our generation.
[00:26:48.500 --> 00:26:52.520]   So we think, when we hear the term adoption, we think, "Oh, God had mercy on us."
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:55.460]   Which is all true.
[00:26:55.460 --> 00:27:02.480]   But in the Greco-Roman world, adoption predominantly wasn't for the purpose of mercy.
[00:27:02.480 --> 00:27:09.560]   Adoption oftentimes happened because their wife couldn't have a boy for whatever, they
[00:27:09.560 --> 00:27:11.840]   couldn't have children at all or they couldn't have a boy.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:16.120]   And so they would go and adopt a child for the purpose of carrying on the name of that
[00:27:16.120 --> 00:27:17.120]   person.
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:22.000]   Because in that world, if you didn't have a son, your name and your generation would
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.100]   end with you.
[00:27:24.100 --> 00:27:29.040]   So in order to prevent that tragedy, they would go and adopt a son and give him that
[00:27:29.040 --> 00:27:33.840]   son's, your name, in order that your name would continue.
[00:27:33.840 --> 00:27:38.960]   You know, what was interesting was, a few months ago, I was at the church at Living
[00:27:38.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   Way and I was speaking at the retreat.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:41.960]   This is Pastor Ray Cosley.
[00:27:41.960 --> 00:27:43.640]   Some of you guys would know him.
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:45.920]   He's an African-American pastor.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:50.760]   He's a very popular speaker at our church, so we've had him come and speak many times.
[00:27:50.760 --> 00:27:56.120]   He's married to a Caucasian lady and he himself told us that all his children are very light
[00:27:56.120 --> 00:27:57.120]   skinned.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:28:02.240]   So when I was at his church speaking, you couldn't readily identify his children because
[00:28:02.240 --> 00:28:03.880]   they're, again, they're very light skinned.
[00:28:03.880 --> 00:28:06.160]   He's married to a Caucasian lady.
[00:28:06.160 --> 00:28:07.840]   But there's another pastor at the church.
[00:28:07.840 --> 00:28:11.560]   His name is James Im and he's 100% Korean-American.
[00:28:11.560 --> 00:28:17.960]   His wife is 100% Korean-American and they've adopted two African-American children.
[00:28:17.960 --> 00:28:21.480]   So if you go to that church, you would naturally automatically think, "Oh, Pastor Ray, are
[00:28:21.480 --> 00:28:22.480]   these your kids?"
[00:28:22.480 --> 00:28:23.480]   He's like, "No, those are not my kids.
[00:28:23.480 --> 00:28:24.480]   They're his kids."
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:31.360]   And what was interesting was we were having dinner one day and he was telling me that
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:35.000]   in his family that they don't have any boys.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:36.920]   His brother, his sister, none of them.
[00:28:36.920 --> 00:28:37.920]   None of them have boys.
[00:28:37.920 --> 00:28:38.920]   They all have girls.
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:42.440]   So in fact, he had two girls naturally.
[00:28:42.440 --> 00:28:46.280]   But the only two boys in that whole family are the two African-American boys that they
[00:28:46.280 --> 00:28:47.880]   adopted.
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:49.520]   So their name is David Im.
[00:28:49.520 --> 00:28:51.200]   I forgot the other kid's name, right?
[00:28:51.200 --> 00:28:53.220]   So his last name is Im.
[00:28:53.220 --> 00:28:57.560]   So he was jokingly telling me, "One of these days when they grow up, they're going to have
[00:28:57.560 --> 00:29:01.520]   to explain how they got the name Im.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:08.480]   Because at some point, all the Im's in that family may be African-American because of
[00:29:08.480 --> 00:29:09.480]   his children."
[00:29:09.480 --> 00:29:13.040]   And he was telling me, "Yeah, these are the only boys in our family.
[00:29:13.040 --> 00:29:15.280]   They're going to carry on the Im name."
[00:29:15.280 --> 00:29:21.320]   In the Greco-Roman world, when they talked about adoption, that's how they viewed adoption.
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:27.080]   It was for the purpose of carrying on the inheritance, the name and the inheritance
[00:29:27.080 --> 00:29:29.260]   of the father.
[00:29:29.260 --> 00:29:34.540]   So it makes sense when the scripture talks about adoption and inheritance always go hand
[00:29:34.540 --> 00:29:35.540]   in hand.
[00:29:35.540 --> 00:29:39.160]   So the reason why this is significant, not that if you adopt for the purpose of mercy
[00:29:39.160 --> 00:29:47.320]   that it's any less, but because in the Greco-Roman world that that child was adopted for that
[00:29:47.320 --> 00:29:52.580]   purpose, do you think that that child was one of many children in the home?
[00:29:52.580 --> 00:29:53.580]   He was not.
[00:29:53.580 --> 00:29:55.580]   He was the child.
[00:29:55.580 --> 00:30:01.560]   He was the one because through that child, the name was going to be passed down.
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:04.360]   So how precious was that child?
[00:30:04.360 --> 00:30:08.840]   Everything that the father owns, his honor, his name, was to be carried down through that
[00:30:08.840 --> 00:30:09.840]   adopted child.
[00:30:09.840 --> 00:30:13.700]   And that's how the Greco-Roman world understood adoption.
[00:30:13.700 --> 00:30:17.460]   So it is not simply, well you have the regular children and then you have the adopted children
[00:30:17.460 --> 00:30:20.420]   which is kind of, you know, trying to get the two things mixed.
[00:30:20.420 --> 00:30:26.260]   But an adoption at that particular time automatically was understood as someone who was very, very
[00:30:26.260 --> 00:30:29.400]   precious to the father.
[00:30:29.400 --> 00:30:35.700]   That's the imagery that is used here to describe what you and I have become.
[00:30:35.700 --> 00:30:38.460]   That we're no longer aliens and strangers who are far off.
[00:30:38.460 --> 00:30:43.900]   The Holy Spirit not only delivered us from the bondage of sin leading to fear, He made
[00:30:43.900 --> 00:30:44.900]   us His children.
[00:30:44.900 --> 00:30:50.420]   And the Holy Spirit confirms that through that, that we are able to call Him our Abba
[00:30:50.420 --> 00:30:53.660]   Father.
[00:30:53.660 --> 00:30:58.820]   That's why the Bible tells us, "Be holy because your Heavenly Father is holy."
[00:30:58.820 --> 00:31:03.020]   The motivation behind our sanctification is not simply because it's right.
[00:31:03.020 --> 00:31:05.660]   It's not because we owe Him.
[00:31:05.660 --> 00:31:08.460]   First and foremost, it's because our Father is holy.
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:13.660]   Just like an adopted child is to take on the name and the honor and the inheritance of
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.860]   the father, we are called to take on that brand.
[00:31:16.860 --> 00:31:23.900]   God is seeking His own glory in the life and the thoughts and the heart and the worship
[00:31:23.900 --> 00:31:26.900]   of His adopted children.
[00:31:26.900 --> 00:31:31.020]   I was very aware of this when I was younger that I was a pastor's son.
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:35.660]   And even when I wasn't a Christian, I couldn't leave the church, even though I wanted to
[00:31:35.660 --> 00:31:41.020]   leave the church, because I knew that if I left the church when I was younger, how that
[00:31:41.020 --> 00:31:42.920]   would reflect on my death.
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:46.300]   Even as a non-Christian, I remember thinking that.
[00:31:46.300 --> 00:31:51.460]   So I remember even before, even as a young as 14, thinking, "When I'm 18, I'm leaving
[00:31:51.460 --> 00:31:52.460]   the church."
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:56.060]   Like, I never shared this with anybody, you know, especially with my parents, because
[00:31:56.060 --> 00:31:59.700]   if I knew if I left the church at 17, there was going to be an uproar, "How can a pastor's
[00:31:59.700 --> 00:32:01.620]   son leave the church?"
[00:32:01.620 --> 00:32:05.420]   But I was very aware of who I was and how that reflected on my father.
[00:32:05.420 --> 00:32:11.940]   See, the scripture primarily teaches us that to pursue sanctification because our heavenly
[00:32:11.940 --> 00:32:14.660]   father is holy.
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:19.420]   It's when we don't have, that's why this relationship with our father is so important, because all
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:25.420]   that we have and all that we pursue is motivated by a personal relationship with him.
[00:32:25.420 --> 00:32:29.580]   So if you don't have a personal affection for him, you don't have the motivation for
[00:32:29.580 --> 00:32:32.580]   sanctification.
[00:32:32.580 --> 00:32:36.380]   He identifies us, right?
[00:32:36.380 --> 00:32:39.860]   He causes us to be delivered.
[00:32:39.860 --> 00:32:44.980]   Thirdly, the Holy Spirit compels us to pray and to seek the Father.
[00:32:44.980 --> 00:32:47.900]   Verse 15, let me read it again.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:51.420]   For you did not receive the spirit of slavery to fall back into fear, but you have received
[00:32:51.420 --> 00:32:56.860]   the spirit of adoption as sons by whom we cry, "Abba, Father."
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:03.340]   See, a Jew, when he heard the Lord's Prayer, typically if you've ever heard an exposition
[00:33:03.340 --> 00:33:08.340]   of the Lord's Prayer, we would stop by saying, "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed
[00:33:08.340 --> 00:33:09.340]   be thy name.
[00:33:09.340 --> 00:33:11.620]   Thy kingdom come, thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:33:11.620 --> 00:33:16.340]   And usually where we stop for exposition is, "Hallowed be thy name."
[00:33:16.340 --> 00:33:18.420]   Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.460]   What does hallowed be thy name mean, especially if you memorized it in King James, right?
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.780]   I memorized it in King James, "Hallowed be thy name."
[00:33:24.780 --> 00:33:31.220]   And I learned through study that it means to magnify, to honor, to glorify, right?
[00:33:31.220 --> 00:33:35.900]   And so usually we would begin the exposition of the Lord's Prayer by, "Hallowed be thy
[00:33:35.900 --> 00:33:36.900]   name."
[00:33:36.900 --> 00:33:44.240]   A Jew, at that particular time, would have heard if when Jesus says, "Our Father which
[00:33:44.240 --> 00:33:47.420]   art in heaven," they wouldn't have stopped with, "Hallowed be thy name."
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:33:50.940]   They would have stopped at, "Our Father."
[00:33:50.940 --> 00:33:56.800]   Because they were afraid to even say His name.
[00:33:56.800 --> 00:34:00.540]   They would call Him Adonai, Lord, because they were afraid to use His name in vain,
[00:34:00.540 --> 00:34:04.740]   to have this intimate relationship with the Heavenly Father.
[00:34:04.740 --> 00:34:08.340]   They would have said, "Father, stop.
[00:34:08.340 --> 00:34:10.460]   You want me to address Him as Father?"
[00:34:10.460 --> 00:34:14.260]   Now, it wasn't because that they never did it.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.260]   You know, there are places where Israel is referred to as son and children, but it just
[00:34:19.260 --> 00:34:20.260]   was not common.
[00:34:20.260 --> 00:34:22.700]   That's just typically not something you do.
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:28.500]   It was kind of like, you know, your son coming in and saying, "Hey, Peter, what did you
[00:34:28.500 --> 00:34:29.500]   say?"
[00:34:29.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   Right?
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:32.420]   Just say, "Hey, tell Peter this, tell Peter that."
[00:34:32.420 --> 00:34:35.300]   That's how a Jew may have understood.
[00:34:35.300 --> 00:34:40.860]   Not only was it disrespectful, it seemed inappropriate, but Jesus is giving them authority that you're
[00:34:40.860 --> 00:34:42.580]   not just subjects of God.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:44.540]   Remember Jesus said that?
[00:34:44.540 --> 00:34:45.540]   Right?
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.260]   You're not just slaves, you're not just servants.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:48.260]   I call you my friends.
[00:34:48.260 --> 00:34:50.620]   And He says we're co-heirs.
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:59.260]   So Jesus is authorizing His disciples in addressing God, first and foremost, as Father.
[00:34:59.260 --> 00:35:06.540]   See the Scripture says the Holy Spirit compels us to seek the Father and cry out, "Abba,
[00:35:06.540 --> 00:35:07.820]   Father."
[00:35:07.820 --> 00:35:12.540]   In almost every instance that we see Jesus addressed, seeing His Father, it's almost
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:13.540]   always Father.
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:14.540]   Right?
[00:35:14.540 --> 00:35:17.620]   Or Abba, Father at the Garden of Gethsemane.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.460]   Only one time we see in Jesus' life where He calls Him God.
[00:35:20.460 --> 00:35:21.860]   And you guys remember where that was?
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:26.460]   Where He's hanging on the cross and He says, "My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?"
[00:35:26.460 --> 00:35:30.180]   In that moment of separation because He was taken on the sin of the world.
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:31.860]   But in every other instance.
[00:35:31.860 --> 00:35:34.220]   But not only does He call Him Abba, Father.
[00:35:34.220 --> 00:35:43.780]   He says, "Now you have become my brothers and you are authorized to call Him Abba, Father."
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:46.500]   The word for cry out.
[00:35:46.500 --> 00:35:49.860]   John Stott says the word "krazo."
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:35:52.780]   You know, even in the English it is a very strong word.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:53.780]   To cry out.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.620]   It's not just to simply speak.
[00:35:55.620 --> 00:35:57.980]   It's not simply to say, but to cry out.
[00:35:57.980 --> 00:36:00.740]   But this is what John Stott says about this word.
[00:36:00.740 --> 00:36:04.460]   It expresses a loud, spontaneous, emotional shout.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:05.460]   To cry out.
[00:36:05.460 --> 00:36:08.940]   To scream or to shriek.
[00:36:08.940 --> 00:36:16.580]   And that same word, cry out, shriek, was referred to when the demons saw Jesus and in terror
[00:36:16.580 --> 00:36:18.140]   they shrieked.
[00:36:18.140 --> 00:36:22.380]   And that's the word that is used here to cry out.
[00:36:22.380 --> 00:36:29.180]   The meaning behind this is that the Holy Spirit that in our utter desperation comes and compels
[00:36:29.180 --> 00:36:32.540]   us to go to the Father.
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:38.500]   It is the Holy Spirit that reminds us of the intimacy that we have with Him.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:43.060]   That you are not just going to a throne, some king.
[00:36:43.060 --> 00:36:46.700]   That you're going to your Father's place.
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:51.020]   In Romans 8.26, "And likewise the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know what
[00:36:51.020 --> 00:36:52.860]   to pray for as we ought.
[00:36:52.860 --> 00:37:00.140]   But the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words."
[00:37:00.140 --> 00:37:07.020]   Have you ever been in a situation where your prayers were just groans?
[00:37:07.020 --> 00:37:12.880]   That you were in such despair and felt like there's no help.
[00:37:12.880 --> 00:37:16.900]   That all you could say before God, you couldn't articulate the words.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.380]   And there was a groaning in your heart.
[00:37:19.380 --> 00:37:23.440]   And that's how it's described when your pain is so deep.
[00:37:23.440 --> 00:37:27.100]   When your despair is beyond comprehension and you're groaning.
[00:37:27.100 --> 00:37:33.180]   He says, "Know that the Holy Spirit has been given to you that He may also groan with words
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:35.380]   that you cannot express."
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:38.580]   He's interceding for us.
[00:37:38.580 --> 00:37:43.180]   When someone is in so much pain, you know, usually we have words that encourage people.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:44.660]   All things work together for good.
[00:37:44.660 --> 00:37:46.620]   You know, rejoice, have right perspective.
[00:37:46.620 --> 00:37:51.460]   We say all of these things, you know, meaning well.
[00:37:51.460 --> 00:37:55.180]   But there are situations, there are things that people go through where words actually
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:56.180]   end up hurting.
[00:37:56.180 --> 00:38:00.380]   You know, you're going through anguish and you're really suffering and somebody just
[00:38:00.380 --> 00:38:03.460]   comes along and says, "Hey, rejoice always.
[00:38:03.460 --> 00:38:06.020]   God works everything for good."
[00:38:06.020 --> 00:38:08.020]   Right words, wrong time.
[00:38:08.020 --> 00:38:13.460]   See, he's talking about as Christians living in a fallen world.
[00:38:13.460 --> 00:38:17.300]   And I think everybody experiences this at different levels.
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.500]   Because we live in a fallen world.
[00:38:19.500 --> 00:38:20.500]   There's sin around us.
[00:38:20.500 --> 00:38:21.500]   There's sin in us.
[00:38:21.500 --> 00:38:23.580]   And so we have relational issues.
[00:38:23.580 --> 00:38:25.700]   We have relational issues at work.
[00:38:25.700 --> 00:38:27.540]   We have a hard time understanding each other.
[00:38:27.540 --> 00:38:31.520]   Even with our wives and even with our children.
[00:38:31.520 --> 00:38:38.300]   In the midst of anguish, he says, "The Holy Spirit has been given to us and it compels
[00:38:38.300 --> 00:38:47.020]   us to cry out to our Abba Father that he may listen and answer our prayers."
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:50.620]   It's the Holy Spirit that leads and guides us to him.
[00:38:50.620 --> 00:38:54.980]   Fourth, he says, "The Holy Spirit guarantees."
[00:38:54.980 --> 00:38:56.860]   He guarantees our inheritance.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:03.060]   In Ephesians 1, 13-14, "In him you also, when you heard the word of the truth, the
[00:39:03.060 --> 00:39:07.660]   gospel of your salvation, and believed in him, were sealed with the promised Holy Spirit
[00:39:07.660 --> 00:39:13.100]   who is the guarantee of our inheritance until we acquire possession of it to the praise
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:15.860]   of his glory."
[00:39:15.860 --> 00:39:16.860]   To the praise of his glory.
[00:39:16.860 --> 00:39:24.140]   He said, "The Holy Spirit was given to us guaranteeing our salvation."
[00:39:24.140 --> 00:39:28.980]   I know that those of you who have been a Christian for a while, there are certain sins and certain
[00:39:28.980 --> 00:39:32.780]   struggles that you've had for a long time.
[00:39:32.780 --> 00:39:37.380]   And there are certain things that you may have even questioned yourself.
[00:39:37.380 --> 00:39:40.220]   What is going to cause us to persevere?
[00:39:40.220 --> 00:39:46.140]   What causes us to make it from point A to point B after all these years?
[00:39:46.140 --> 00:39:48.780]   It is not your willpower.
[00:39:48.780 --> 00:39:51.020]   It is not your intelligence.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.020]   It is not your background.
[00:39:52.020 --> 00:39:55.940]   These are all things that the Pharisees were confident about.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:39:59.420]   So when Jesus said, "When the Son comes to set you free, you will be free indeed,"
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:00.420]   they got offended.
[00:40:00.420 --> 00:40:03.060]   I don't need freedom.
[00:40:03.060 --> 00:40:04.060]   It is not your heritage.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.060]   It is not your wisdom.
[00:40:05.060 --> 00:40:06.060]   It is not your education.
[00:40:06.060 --> 00:40:07.500]   It is not your willpower.
[00:40:07.500 --> 00:40:11.620]   The Bible says what you could not do, God did by sending his Holy Spirit.
[00:40:11.620 --> 00:40:15.820]   And what is the primary work of the Holy Spirit?
[00:40:15.820 --> 00:40:18.700]   Guaranteeing the inheritance.
[00:40:18.700 --> 00:40:21.740]   Guaranteeing the inheritance.
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:25.500]   If one of my children, not my older children obviously, but if one of my children, I guess
[00:40:25.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   I only have one, okay?
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.500]   So it's Isaiah.
[00:40:27.500 --> 00:40:30.820]   He's young enough to use him as an illustration.
[00:40:30.820 --> 00:40:34.900]   One day walked off, couldn't find him for days, and then we find out that he's wandering
[00:40:34.900 --> 00:40:36.500]   out in Santa Ana.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:40.780]   We get a phone call and I run over there to get him.
[00:40:40.780 --> 00:40:42.500]   Obviously we're frantically looking for him.
[00:40:42.500 --> 00:40:47.900]   We find him and then I go there and then I say, "Look Isaiah, this is how you get home,
[00:40:47.900 --> 00:40:48.900]   okay?
[00:40:48.900 --> 00:40:52.740]   Now get out a pen, take the number 15 bus, right?
[00:40:52.740 --> 00:40:57.500]   Get on it and make a ride on Grand Street and then go there for about three hours and
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.060]   then get off that bus and you don't have any money so you're going to have to get a job.
[00:41:01.060 --> 00:41:02.060]   So $3.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:05.420]   Somehow get $3, get on that bus and then go on there.
[00:41:05.420 --> 00:41:09.140]   It's going to take you about six hours to get there but good luck.
[00:41:09.140 --> 00:41:11.660]   I'll see you when you get home."
[00:41:11.660 --> 00:41:14.420]   Now what parent would do that?
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:16.380]   Logically, you know what I would do.
[00:41:16.380 --> 00:41:17.700]   You know what any parent would do.
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:24.420]   When I find him, I'm going to grab him and I'm going to stick him in the car and I'm
[00:41:24.420 --> 00:41:30.740]   going to put the seatbelt on him so tight that he may not be able to breathe, lock all
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:36.860]   the child safety, you know, and all the doors, make sure all the windows are locked up and
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:43.220]   then drive and go home, put him in the bed, tuck him in and then lock the front door and
[00:41:43.220 --> 00:41:45.780]   make sure that he never escapes again.
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:52.900]   Make sure, I will sit at that door, make sure that he can't ever open and put the lock way
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:56.340]   up here so he can never reach it, right?
[00:41:56.340 --> 00:41:57.340]   Why?
[00:41:57.340 --> 00:42:01.020]   To make sure that we don't lose him again.
[00:42:01.020 --> 00:42:06.820]   See the scripture, when the Bible tells us that it leads us, he leads us to sanctification,
[00:42:06.820 --> 00:42:11.020]   he empowers us for ministry to preach the gospel, he convicts the world of sin but the
[00:42:11.020 --> 00:42:21.820]   primary work that the Holy Spirit has given us is to help us to go home.
[00:42:21.820 --> 00:42:28.340]   Is to help us to go home because you and I lost our way.
[00:42:28.340 --> 00:42:32.920]   He didn't just give us instructions and say, "Hey, follow these instructions and hopefully
[00:42:32.920 --> 00:42:34.340]   you can make it home."
[00:42:34.340 --> 00:42:36.060]   He didn't do that.
[00:42:36.060 --> 00:42:39.060]   When the disciples were concerned, "If you leave us, what's going to happen to us?"
[00:42:39.060 --> 00:42:43.740]   Remember what Jesus said, "I will not leave you as an orphan, the helper, he's going to
[00:42:43.740 --> 00:42:49.260]   come and he's going to teach you everything that I have taught you."
[00:42:49.260 --> 00:42:53.020]   So you need to remain, stay with him.
[00:42:53.020 --> 00:42:58.180]   You need to rest in him and you need to rely on him because the Holy Spirit is going to
[00:42:58.180 --> 00:43:04.980]   come as a deposit, guaranteeing, "I'm going to put you in the car, I'm going to strap
[00:43:04.980 --> 00:43:09.520]   you in, I'm going to take you home and I'm going to make sure that you're going to make
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:11.940]   it home."
[00:43:11.940 --> 00:43:14.940]   That's why the Holy Spirit came.
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:18.740]   That's what we have in the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:23.940]   This primary work, 2 Corinthians 1:21, "And it is God who established us with you in Christ
[00:43:23.940 --> 00:43:29.940]   and has anointed us and who has also put a seal on us, giving us the Holy Spirit in our
[00:43:29.940 --> 00:43:32.380]   hearts as a guarantee."
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:33.380]   Guarantee.
[00:43:33.380 --> 00:43:40.940]   And you know what this inheritance is that he's bringing us to?
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:46.740]   Douglas Moo says the inheritance that he's talking about is not a mansion, is not a great
[00:43:46.740 --> 00:43:51.700]   house, is not whatever that you are fantasizing about when you get to heaven.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:57.700]   All of these things may be true because he is our Father.
[00:43:57.700 --> 00:44:00.620]   He is our inheritance.
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:07.820]   He is the one that he sent this Holy Spirit to bring us to, to bring him back.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:13.540]   If I picked up Isaiah and brought him to Irvine and then dropped him off at that house and
[00:44:13.540 --> 00:44:14.540]   said, "You know what?
[00:44:14.540 --> 00:44:15.540]   Good luck."
[00:44:15.540 --> 00:44:17.980]   But we moved.
[00:44:17.980 --> 00:44:18.980]   That's where you live, that's your house.
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.380]   But that's not his home.
[00:44:21.380 --> 00:44:25.340]   His home is wherever we are.
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:29.500]   His home, he's safe there because that's where his parents are.
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:34.380]   Heaven would be worthless if that's not where our Father was.
[00:44:34.380 --> 00:44:37.060]   See he's not bringing us to heaven.
[00:44:37.060 --> 00:44:42.220]   He's bringing us to his home to be by his side so that he can protect us, so that he
[00:44:42.220 --> 00:44:45.580]   can love us.
[00:44:45.580 --> 00:44:50.060]   Psalm 73, 25, "Who have I in heaven but you?
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:53.720]   And there is nothing on earth that I desire besides you.
[00:44:53.720 --> 00:45:00.820]   My flesh and my heart may fail, but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever."
[00:45:00.820 --> 00:45:08.780]   Every Christian has been given the Holy Spirit to deliver us from bondage into sonship.
[00:45:08.780 --> 00:45:14.860]   It compels us to cry out to the Abba Father with groanings.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:21.660]   He reminds us of the inheritance that we have in Christ and the Holy Spirit is the one who
[00:45:21.660 --> 00:45:28.540]   preserves us, joining with Christ, that we may make it home to our Father.
[00:45:28.540 --> 00:45:32.180]   You know sometimes we just need perspective.
[00:45:32.180 --> 00:45:36.740]   I'm not telling you anything that you don't already have.
[00:45:36.740 --> 00:45:41.600]   Everything that Paul says is telling Christians that this is what you have.
[00:45:41.600 --> 00:45:46.740]   And just like these men, you know, I have just being around these guys just makes me
[00:45:46.740 --> 00:45:50.460]   remember the blessing that I have.
[00:45:50.460 --> 00:45:57.540]   Sometimes we just need to remember, you and I have this and this is why we worship.
[00:45:57.540 --> 00:45:58.540]   Let's pray.
[00:45:58.540 --> 00:46:10.260]   Again, I want to invite you to take some time to pray and to come before the Lord in honest
[00:46:10.260 --> 00:46:11.900]   prayer.
[00:46:11.900 --> 00:46:14.380]   Sometimes we make prayer so complicated that it needs to be biblical.
[00:46:14.380 --> 00:46:16.340]   We need to say the right words.
[00:46:16.340 --> 00:46:20.380]   The best prayer is always the honest prayer.
[00:46:20.380 --> 00:46:23.120]   I believe, help my unbelief.
[00:46:23.120 --> 00:46:28.460]   Pray where you are, what you're going through, what you're feeling and be honest before God.
[00:46:28.460 --> 00:46:31.660]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:34.240]   (upbeat music)
