[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   (Pause)
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   Alright, good morning.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   We're going to take a break from the study of Hebrews,
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   and we're going to be jumping into Philippians 2, verse 14-18.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing,
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   Children of God, above reproach, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   among whom you appear as lights in the world,
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory,
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   because I did not run in vain, nor toil in vain.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.000]   But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering,
[00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   upon the sacrifice and service of your faith,
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your guidance,
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   and let your word go forth and nothing else.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be discerning hearers,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:16.000]   that we would test the scriptures, Lord God,
[00:01:16.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and make sure that it is your voice that we hear.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So we pray that you would protect our pulpit,
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   that you would protect the hearers,
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that all that we believe and all that we apply,
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   that it may be coming with your authority and your word.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   Well, Merry Thanksgiving, everybody.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   So, did you know Thanksgiving is this Thursday?
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:47.000]   You would never know by what's going on,
[00:01:47.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   but every single year we hear less of Thanksgiving.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   There's already talks of Christmas.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   In previous years, Christmas lights and Christmas trees
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   don't get put up until after Black Friday.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.000]   But I've heard more about Black Friday this year than I've done Thanksgiving.
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   Have you heard of Thanksgiving?
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   I'm trying to look for who's actually talking about Thanksgiving.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   All I've heard is what you can't do on Thanksgiving.
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:15.000]   You're not supposed to do this, you're not supposed to do that.
[00:02:15.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   Thanksgiving is a uniquely Christian holiday,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   and I think part of the reason, it may not be all the reason,
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:24.000]   but part of the reason why Thanksgiving is kind of slowly dying out
[00:02:24.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   is because I don't think the secular knows what to do with this.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   Because it's a unique holiday that was set apart for worship,
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   to give thanks to God for what God has done.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   And I think it's important for us as Christians that,
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   again, not just once a year,
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   but celebrating Thanksgiving is a reminder to us
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   that this is something that we ought to be doing regularly, all the time.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   You know, before we even jump into that,
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I want to get some stuff off my chest,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   because before we get into Thanksgiving,
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   I want to share with you some of the things that's been bothering me.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   Just this week, I got new neighbors,
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   we're living in a cul-de-sac, and before they moved in,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   we had the reign of parking in our cul-de-sac.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   And so we're able to park anywhere we want,
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:14.000]   and all of a sudden, this--it looked like some kind of daycare center moved in,
[00:03:14.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   because they got all kinds of cars sitting outside.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Now, whenever we park, we have to maneuver with them, you know?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   So we have to have a strategy.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   When you come home, park your car, make sure you park on the street first.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   So we're going to dominate this, and then park.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   So every time I come out, I check the city,
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:35.000]   it was like, "Oh, my gosh, they got like five cars out here."
[00:03:35.000 --> 00:03:38.000]   Anyway, I'm getting some of that off my chest.
[00:03:38.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Ever since the pandemic--some of you guys know,
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:44.000]   we live right by the train station, and then behind there's like a walkway.
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   And usually it's not used well, but ever since the pandemic,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   people have been exercising there, hanging out there,
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   the teenagers are riding their skateboards up and down,
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:56.000]   and so it's always busy.
[00:03:56.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So every morning, I'm doing quiet time reading the Bible,
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   and I hear them yelling and screaming.
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Anyway, I'm getting some of that off my chest, okay?
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   So this is what's been going on in my life.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   This week, I was driving from--
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   I went to Carl's Jr. to pick a hamburger for lunch,
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   and I asked them to give me extra lettuce on my Famous Star,
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   and by the time I got back, instead of giving me extra lettuce,
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:27.000]   they gave me a lettuce wrap.
[00:04:27.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   I've never eaten lettuce wrap before.
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   I was thinking, "If I wanted salad, I would have ordered salad," right?
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   And so that same day, I was coming back from Carl's Jr.,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   it was like a right turn right off of coming into, I think, Red Hill in--
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   what is that? Red Hill in Maine?
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   And I'm making a right turn, but you know one of those people
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:52.000]   that always--they're intending to go straight,
[00:04:52.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   but they park right in the middle?
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   You know what I'm talking about? You guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   You know how frustrating that is?
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   They're not trying to make a right turn, they're going to go straight,
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   and they're taking up both lanes.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:06.000]   So this guy, I was about to make a right turn, and then he wouldn't budge.
[00:05:06.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   So I said, "Okay, I'm a pastor, so I better..."
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   So I just sat there waiting for the red light to turn,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   but he looked, and we made eye contact,
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   and the first thing I see, his middle finger goes up.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   And I said, "What did I do?"
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   And he said, "Yeah, I don't have a pleasant resting face."
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So maybe he looked at me, and he thought I was angry,
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:31.000]   and he just flipped me off, he's like, "Wow."
[00:05:31.000 --> 00:05:36.000]   And that's with the lettuce wrap in the car, which I didn't know.
[00:05:36.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   And then here's the worst.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:43.000]   So I've been trying to deal with something that's been going on with Amazon.
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   They said that I owed back taxes for something that happened on Amazon,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:51.000]   and so I've been on the phone with them for the last three days,
[00:05:51.000 --> 00:05:55.000]   for hours and hours, and I've talked to them over ten people,
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   and I've been trying to contact them through the phone, through the Internet,
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:03.000]   I've gone to Amazon.com, and the only time they give any kind of response
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   is if I put something on Amazon.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   So I was on the phone that day with Amazon, going back and forth
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   to the callers in India, to America, back and forth, back and forth,
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:18.000]   and then I just was so tired, and I was on the phone for about two hours,
[00:06:18.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and during the two hours, there's long breaks in between,
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   so I said, "Wait a second, let me look this up, let me look this up."
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:27.000]   And I've already gone through hours of this, and this is the ninth or tenth person,
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   so as I was grumbling inside, I was preparing this sermon
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   about not grumbling.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   So I just wanted to get this off my chest, because when I think about Thanksgiving,
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   it's like, what are you thankful for?
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   Every year during Thanksgiving, what are you thankful for?
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Thank you for the family, thank you for this job, thank you for salvation.
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   And we have this road thing that we go through,
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   it's like, "Oh, I should be thankful for that."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:55.000]   So what's bothering you?
[00:06:55.000 --> 00:06:58.000]   That's a much easier question to answer.
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   What's bothering you?
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   For most people, it doesn't really take long.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:06.000]   We have to force ourselves, like, "I'm going to be thankful, I'm going to be thankful."
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   But what's bothering us is like always sitting at the tip of our tongue,
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:15.000]   and the application, right, we always have to apply,
[00:07:15.000 --> 00:07:18.000]   say, "Oh, I'm going to be more positive, I'm going to be more thankful."
[00:07:18.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   But our heart condition naturally is to grumble.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Our natural condition is naturally to grumble.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   Today's sermon is about grumbling.
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   The opposite of Thanksgiving, it's about grumbling.
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   So I'm going to be grumbling about grumbling this morning.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:35.000]   So the text that we're looking at,
[00:07:35.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   Apostle Paul is writing, even though he's writing this letter of joy,
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   if you study Philippians well enough,
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   you know that at the end of Philippians, he's asking,
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:48.000]   because there's a division that's taking place between these two prominent sisters.
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:51.000]   He's saying, "Hey, can you guys please help them out?"
[00:07:51.000 --> 00:07:55.000]   And obviously that theme of division in this church,
[00:07:55.000 --> 00:07:58.000]   if you restudy the book of Philippians,
[00:07:58.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   even though there's a larger theme of rejoicing the Lord,
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   but the reason why he keeps reminding them to rejoice
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   is because there's an underlying division that's taking place in the church.
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   And if you go back and study Philippians,
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:14.000]   you'll see that that's kind of what he's touching upon,
[00:08:14.000 --> 00:08:16.000]   and then he brings the main point at the end.
[00:08:16.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   "Please help these sisters to get along."
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   That's why he writes Philippians chapter 1, chapter 2,
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   "Don't be selfish, look up for other people, consider them better than yourselves,
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   and have the attitude of Jesus."
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   All that is written, not randomly,
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:32.000]   not just so that we can understand Christianity,
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   it's because there was an underlying division taking place in the church.
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   And it is in that context, after he says, "Look at the example of Jesus Christ,"
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   and then he says in verse 14,
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:47.000]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing."
[00:08:47.000 --> 00:08:50.000]   And the reason why he's saying that is because that was the underlying reason
[00:08:50.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   why there was division in the church.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing."
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   The word for grumbling, another word is murmuring.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   All the times grumbling is just, "Ugh!"
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   You know, you don't like something, and if you're an extrovert,
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   you'll articulate what you don't like.
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   "I don't like this because of that. I don't like this because of that."
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   If you're an introvert, there's, "Ugh!"
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   And that's the sound that you hear internally.
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   "Ugh!"
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   You don't like something, it's, "Hmm."
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:24.000]   So that's what this means.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   "Do not grumble or murmur."
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   1 Peter 4:9, "Be hospitable to one another without complaint."
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:35.000]   If you're complaining, why would you be hospitable?
[00:09:35.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   See, he's talking about Christians who are trying to live their Christian life,
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   but they're doing it grudgingly.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   That's why he says, "Be hospitable without complaining."
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   Do what you're supposed to do without murmuring.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   Israelites, the 40 years out in the desert,
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:56.000]   if there's one characteristic about the Israelites that's highlighted,
[00:09:56.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   is their grumbling.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:00.000]   They had problems with idolatry.
[00:10:00.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   They had all kinds of problems during the 40 years.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   In fact, they got into, one tribe, the Simeonites,
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   got into idolatry and sexual immorality.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   Half of their tribes get wiped out out of judgment of God.
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   But instead, the primary sin that is pointed out in 1 Corinthians 10, 10-11,
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   is that they were constantly grumbling.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:26.000]   And it was their grumbling that led to the judgment of God.
[00:10:26.000 --> 00:10:30.000]   When we think about grumbling, usually if we have all the list of sins
[00:10:30.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   that we should be concerned about, sexual immorality, murder, slander,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:38.000]   you've got a bunch of things that we would think are highlighted.
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:42.000]   We wouldn't think murmuring or grumbling to be one of those things
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   that we should put on the top of the list.
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:50.000]   Yet, when the Bible warns us about why the judgment came to the nation of Israel,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:55.000]   one of the primary sins that he points out is that they were constantly grumbling.
[00:10:55.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   In fact, the history of Israel starts with them grumbling.
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:02.000]   Where is God? Why were they enslaved?
[00:11:02.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   And they were crying out, and God had mercy on them.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   So he sends Moses. Moses challenges Pharaoh with the miracles.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And because of that, Moses doesn't immediately respond.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:14.000]   And so he makes it even harder for the slaves.
[00:11:14.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   And then they start murmuring and grumbling about that.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   When God delivers them and takes them to the Red Sea, it's like, "Whoa, we're trapped.
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:24.000]   Why did he do all of that to bring us out here to kill us?"
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:27.000]   And they started grumbling. So God opens up the sea, and they go to the other side.
[00:11:27.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   They sing and celebrate. Soon as they get to the other side, Moses goes up to the mountain.
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   And he's taking so long. He came out here to abandon us?
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   So they make the golden calf. They start worshiping God.
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   He divides the whole community in half.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   And then you would think they learned their lesson.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   Soon after—we're talking about days—they walk out into the desert.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   It's like, "I'm so thirsty. Why did he bring us out here so that we could die of thirst?"
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   So they started grumbling. And then so God gives them water.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:59.000]   And then they move out a little bit further. It's like, "That's it? Water?
[00:11:59.000 --> 00:12:03.000]   What about food? We're going to die out here."
[00:12:03.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   So God gives them miraculous bread, manna, from heaven, literally falling down from heaven.
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   And they start eating that. And then soon after that, they're like, "That's it? Bread?
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:16.000]   What about some protein?"
[00:12:16.000 --> 00:12:20.000]   And they start murmuring and complaining about that. So God gives them quail.
[00:12:20.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   Then after that, it's like, "Okay, we got meat. We got bread. We got miraculous water."
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:31.000]   And God's in our midst. And this cycle happened all along the 40 years.
[00:12:31.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   Constantly grumbling and complaining.
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And the Bible teaches us that that was at the root of what caused them to seek idleship.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   That's a word.
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:48.000]   It's the constant grumbling and complaining and murmuring
[00:12:48.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   that caused them to be discontent and covet what other people had
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   that leads to other sins.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   And the Bible says the reason why there's murder is because there's coveting.
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:02.000]   And because the coveting comes from murmuring.
[00:13:02.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   Because they're constantly discontent.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   In Proverbs 23, 6-7, "Do not eat the bread of a selfish man or desire his delicacy."
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   Even when he's being generous.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   He says, "For as he thinks within himself, so he is."
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:22.000]   He says to you, "Eat and drink, but his heart is not with you."
[00:13:22.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   "You will vomit up the more so you have eaten and waste your compliments."
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   He said even if a man who's constantly grumbling in his heart, he has a selfishness in his heart,
[00:13:31.000 --> 00:13:34.000]   and even when he is being generous, he said, "Don't eat it."
[00:13:34.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   Because that's not really a gift. It's going to turn out where you're going to end up vomiting.
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:43.000]   So when an individual is constantly murmuring and complaining,
[00:13:43.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   it rises up to other sins.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   Even his generosity says to question that.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   See, an individual who's constantly murmuring, it leads to disputing.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   The word disputing in NIV is questioning, dialoguing. That's the literal word for that.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Where an individual who is constantly discontent begins to question everything.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:11.000]   And there's a difference between asking questions and questioning.
[00:14:11.000 --> 00:14:15.000]   Asking questions is trying to figure out what is going on, why is this happening,
[00:14:15.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   and questioning is, "I know what's right, why are you doing it that way?"
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   And when an individual is constantly questioning, there is no real answer, unless you submit to me.
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   In Psalm 1 verse 1 it says,
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   "How blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked, nor stand in the path of sinners,
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:36.000]   nor sit in the seat of scoffers."
[00:14:36.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Do you notice how he says an individual who is walking according to the principles of this world,
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   he will eventually be identified with the sinners, stand in the way of sinners,
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   and then he will sit in the seat of scoffers.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.000]   Who's constantly questioning, murmuring, questioning.
[00:14:54.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   In Isaiah 49 verse 5, this constantly murmuring and questioning eventually rises up to God,
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:03.000]   because your circumstance, ultimately God is sovereign.
[00:15:03.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   So if God is sovereign, why is he allowing this to happen?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:10.000]   Why are they the way that they are?
[00:15:10.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   How come these things are happening, and when we begin to question that, who are we questioning?
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   The only person who has any control over that, and it eventually rises up to God.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Isaiah 45 verse 9, "Woe to the one who quarrels with his maker,
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:27.000]   and earthenware, vessel among the vessels of earth.
[00:15:27.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   Will the clay say to the potter, 'What are you doing?'
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Or the thing you are making say, 'He has no hands.'"
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Much of the complaining and murmuring that happens in our heart is ultimately questioning,
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:43.000]   why is God doing this?
[00:15:43.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   Why did God allow this?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   Why did God put that guy in my life, or this person in my life?
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:51.000]   Why is he doing this?
[00:15:51.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Because we don't understand.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.000]   So therefore, we're not asking, we're questioning.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Sinclair Ferguson, the professor at Westminster Seminary says this,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   "A complaining or arguing spirit is an expression of ingratitude to God's providence."
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   Everybody knows how to be happy when God does what we want.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:20.000]   I want this, I want that, and when he answers my prayer, God is awesome, he's great.
[00:16:20.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   But when it doesn't fit what we think has to happen,
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   he says it's an expression of ingratitude toward God's providence,
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:32.000]   and lovelessness and pride toward others.
[00:16:32.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   It is a denial of grace.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   It is working against salvation rather than working salvation into every aspect of our lives.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   He said all of this.
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   Again, we wouldn't normally think of murmuring and asking questions and disputing
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   as a rebellion against God.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   But the Bible says that when we question the providence of God,
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   that's exactly what we're doing.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:16:58.000]   We're asking God, ultimately, to question God.
[00:16:58.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   Why are you doing this?
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   Even when God asked Adam, "Why did you do that?"
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   He said, "Well, why did you put the woman here?"
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   So ultimately it's your fault.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:17.000]   He says we ought not to do anything without grumbling or disputing.
[00:17:17.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Because ultimately, that's what identifies as a Christian.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   Forgiving, thankfulness is exactly what you and I have been called to be.
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   In verse 15, it says, "So that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent,
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   children of God above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   among whom you appear as lights in the world."
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   The Bible describes our rebellion against God as not acknowledging him
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:48.000]   or giving thanks as our creator.
[00:17:48.000 --> 00:17:51.000]   It says in verse 121, "For even though they knew God,
[00:17:51.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   they did not honor him as God or give thanks.
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   But they became futile in their speculations, and foolish heart was darkened.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:03.000]   And professing to be wise, they became fools,
[00:18:03.000 --> 00:18:08.000]   exchanging the glory of the incorruptible God and an image in the form of corruptible men
[00:18:08.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   and of birds and of four-footed animals and crawling creatures."
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   You notice here that the downward spiral of mankind's rebellion
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   begins by not acknowledging and honoring God or giving thanks.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   They chose to give thanks to the created things rather than the creator.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   You know, oftentimes when the Bible introduces God,
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:37.000]   they don't start with, "He saved us."
[00:18:37.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   Usually when God is introduced, He's introduced as our creator.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   So even before we get to the cross, the fact that He created us,
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   our natural relationship between the creation and the creator
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   is to acknowledge our creator and to give thanks to him.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   Even before we get to the cross, the cross is that that creator that gave us breath,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   the very reason why you and I are here,
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:05.000]   you and I are even able to think and have conversation,
[00:19:05.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   that Yahweh is our creator.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   And that creator happens to love us and gave His only begotten son.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   So He says everything that we need to know,
[00:19:18.000 --> 00:19:22.000]   He revealed Himself as the creator has been given to us
[00:19:22.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   and mankind rather worship the creation rather than the creator.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:28.000]   And as a result of that, what happened?
[00:19:28.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   They became futile in their speculation.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.000]   Speculation meaning their thinking, in their contemplation.
[00:19:35.000 --> 00:19:41.000]   Because when an individual has a heart that is murmuring and grumbling and complaining,
[00:19:41.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   he says it affects the way that they think.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:47.000]   Their whole perspective is affected.
[00:19:47.000 --> 00:19:50.000]   And their foolish heart became darkened.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   Because of their wrong thinking, their hearts became darkened.
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   They professed to be wise but they became fools.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   You ever meet somebody who's constantly murmuring and complaining
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:03.000]   and their primary thing is, "You don't know!"
[00:20:03.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   "You don't know what I know!" "You don't think the way I think!"
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   Well, the Bible says the reason why people don't think the way you think
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   may be because in your constant murmuring and grumbling,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:18.000]   just as the scripture says, it has affected your perspective.
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   And your perspective has affected your heart.
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   And because your heart was darkened and your speculation had become futile,
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:30.000]   it says you think you're wise because you know something that other people don't know,
[00:20:30.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   but in reality, you're the one who became a fool.
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   And it's that all of this downward spiral came because you refused to acknowledge and give thanks to God.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   If you want to fit into this world, just be a good grumbler.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   If you want to really fit in, right?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   Because the world is more united on things that they hate.
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You know, we try to have fellowships like what we love.
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   You want to see a tight-knit group who's passionate about something?
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   It's usually about what they hate.
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:07.000]   You say, "I hate the Republicans!"
[00:21:07.000 --> 00:21:10.000]   "I hate the Democrats!" "I hate them!"
[00:21:10.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   "I hate these people!"
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   "You too?"
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   "Oh yeah, you too?"
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   The world is united by what they hate.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   If you have a full-time job, you know,
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:25.000]   I don't know if you go to water coolers, I don't know if they have that anymore,
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:29.000]   or boba shops, wherever you go to congregate, right?
[00:21:29.000 --> 00:21:34.000]   If you want to fit in, just tell them everything that's bothering you.
[00:21:34.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   "Your boss is unfair."
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   You know, "The government."
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   I mean, just start talking about what's bothering you.
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   Soon enough, people will join in.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   It's like, "Oh, you too?" "You too?" "You too?"
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   And then you have these people who hate this group on one side,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   the other group who hates the other group on the other side,
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and then they hate each other, and you sense fellowship.
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   Because you feel connected.
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   And the way that you're connected is the things that you hate.
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   That's how the world functions.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:11.000]   If you want to fit in, keep grumbling, keep complaining.
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   Let that be the primary thing that you talk about.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   But he says, "We are to be light."
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:20.000]   Our very identity as a Christian,
[00:22:20.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   he calls us to be a light in this dark world.
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Because the world is in rebellion against God,
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   constantly grumbling and complaining about God,
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:33.000]   about the world, about politics, about everything.
[00:22:33.000 --> 00:22:36.000]   And yet, there's no Thanksgiving,
[00:22:36.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   because at the root of what it means to be a Christian is to give worship.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   And at the heart of a person who worships is a thankful heart.
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   In Matthew 5, 14-16, "You are the light of the world.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   The city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.000]   Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand,
[00:22:55.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and it gives light to all who are in the house.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   God said we are the light, and the purpose of why he put us to light
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:12.000]   is so that in darkness he may put us on a pedestal and say,
[00:23:12.000 --> 00:23:14.000]   "That's what God intended, to give glory to God."
[00:23:14.000 --> 00:23:17.000]   Imagine if we were the light and we sat on the table,
[00:23:17.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   and the whole time we're talking about is, "Those guys suck!
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   They suck, and those people suck, and those people suck too!
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:28.000]   And then they suck, and they suck, and then what about these guys?
[00:23:28.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   These guys suck, and they suck too! Believe Jesus with me!"
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   He says we were made to be the light to give glory to God,
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   to declare his glory and who he is and what he has done.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:50.000]   And that's why he says as Christians, as a light,
[00:23:50.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   our primary thing that we are to declare to the world is of who he is,
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:59.000]   not what the world is not.
[00:23:59.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   2 Corinthians 4.15, "For all things are for your sake,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:05.000]   so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people
[00:24:05.000 --> 00:24:09.000]   may cause the giving thanks to abound for the glory of God."
[00:24:09.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   Look what Paul says. Paul says the gospel is continuing to go out.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:15.000]   More people are converting. For what purpose?
[00:24:15.000 --> 00:24:22.000]   "So that more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God."
[00:24:22.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   So he describes conversion as people who were not thankful to be thankful,
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   to have thanksgiving in their heart to give glory to God.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   If you have a murmuring heart, we're not saying that we should never ask questions,
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:39.000]   that we should never have disagreements. That's not what he's saying.
[00:24:39.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   He's talking about a spirit of constantly murmuring.
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   That's the sound. That's the secret sound of a complainer.
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   Because that's what I hear behind this thing.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   I have extra ears.
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:01.000]   I'll give you an announcement and I can look it in your faces.
[00:25:01.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Some of you guys are, "Huh? What's going on?"
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   I see some of your faces.
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:14.000]   I see it. I may be wrong, but there's constant murmuring.
[00:25:14.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   And he says as Christians, our core being of who we are is to give thanks.
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   You cannot give thanks. You cannot spend all week just murmuring, complaining,
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   talking about what's wrong and then come into worship and say, "You're so good, God."
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:35.000]   You may be saying that, but internally you're saying, "What's wrong with them?"
[00:25:35.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   That's actually what's going on in your head and your heart.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.000]   "What's wrong with these people, Lord?"
[00:25:42.000 --> 00:25:47.000]   At the core of who we are, people who refuse to acknowledge God and give thanks,
[00:25:47.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   that he made us worshipers of God because he fills our hearts with no other response,
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:58.000]   no other logical response than to give our lives as a living sacrifice.
[00:25:58.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   It's a reasonable act of worship.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   But he also said, "If I just said, 'Stop it,' we'd all leave kind of frustrated."
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   Well, how do we do that?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:16.000]   If our natural instinct is to grumble, right?
[00:26:16.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   I gave you a short list of things that I was struggling with this week.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:27.000]   I could probably fill that page with about three or four pages of problems, right?
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   Because it's natural.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   If you guys have Thanksgiving dinner, you might sit around and talk about,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   "What are you thankful for?"
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   And then it's like, "Hmm."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   And you have to really--not just this rote answer, "I'm thankful for my parents."
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:44.000]   I'm thankful for what you're really thankful for.
[00:26:44.000 --> 00:26:47.000]   You kind of have to take some time to actually think through.
[00:26:47.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   What's bothering you?
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   How much time you got?
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:53.000]   Because that's our natural state.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   So if we just say, "Hey, stop it!"
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   We'd leave saying, "Oh, that was good.
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   Thank you for reminding me."
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:03.000]   But then to actually practice that, starting from lunch,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:06.000]   you're going to start feeling guilty.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   Until next Thanksgiving, you say, "Hey, stop it!"
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   Well, he's very practical.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:13.000]   He says, "Well, not doing that."
[00:27:13.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Verse 16, "Holding fast the word of life."
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   "Holding fast so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   because I did not run in vain nor toil in vain."
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:25.000]   What does it mean to hold fast the word of life?
[00:27:25.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   If he doesn't want us to grumble and complain,
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:30.000]   then that's our natural response.
[00:27:30.000 --> 00:27:33.000]   And the remedy for that is to hold fast the word of life.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:36.000]   1 Corinthians 15, 1-3, "Now I make known to you, brethren,
[00:27:36.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   the gospel which I preached to you, which also you received,
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   in which also you stand."
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.000]   Not only does the gospel justify you,
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   the gospel is the reason why you're able to stand and be sanctified.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   "By which you also are saved, if you hold fast the word
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   which I preached to you, that you don't drift from that,
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   unless you believed in vain.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   For I delivered to you as of first importance
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   what I also received, that Christ died for our sins
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   according to the Scriptures."
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:08.000]   So what he is saying is to hold fast to the gospel
[00:28:08.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   that you first believed.
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:12.000]   And not just to say, "Well, you know what?
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   I was justified, and tell me something more deep."
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   You know our communion table?
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:23.000]   Jesus, very last activity that he had before he went to pray with them,
[00:28:23.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   he says, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   And in different places they have different words.
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   You have the Lord's table, you have the sacrament,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   you know, you have communion.
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   But one of the words that is used for the Lord's table is "Eucharist."
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Some of you guys may have heard that before.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   The Eucharist is literally the word in Greek, "Euchariste,"
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:46.000]   which means "giving thanks."
[00:28:46.000 --> 00:28:50.000]   So part of the core meaning of the communion table
[00:28:50.000 --> 00:28:55.000]   is to come and when we receive the elements, to give thanks.
[00:28:55.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   And that's exactly what Paul is trying to get at.
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   The reason why there is constant murmuring and questioning
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   is that we have drifted away from a thankful heart for what God has done.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And so we tend to focus on what is not going right,
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   and we rarely talk about thankfulness of God.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   So when you examine your life and your speech,
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   how often are you genuinely thankful for your salvation and what God has done?
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:25.000]   I know we talk about it in Bible study,
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   we talk about it in a certain given time of fellowship
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   when you have questions that you have to ask,
[00:29:31.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   but how often when you look at your conversation
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   are you actually responding to the grace of God?
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:42.000]   "Man, I don't deserve this grace. God is so good to me."
[00:29:42.000 --> 00:29:44.000]   How much of your conversation is that and how much of it is like,
[00:29:44.000 --> 00:29:46.000]   "Yeah, yeah, God is so good. He's so awesome.
[00:29:46.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   But man, what is wrong with this? What is wrong with that?"
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   That's what he means by "hold fast."
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.000]   In fact, our whole study of the book of Hebrews,
[00:29:57.000 --> 00:30:00.000]   when it says, "Do not drift,"
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:04.000]   he keeps saying over and over again, "Hold fast, hold fast, hold fast, hold fast
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   what you profess to believe."
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   Don't make it just a song that you sing.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   Don't make it just a verse that you memorize.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   Don't make it just a doctrinal statement that you believe.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:16.000]   He says that's what he means by "hold fast."
[00:30:16.000 --> 00:30:19.000]   May it affect your heart, may it affect your speech,
[00:30:19.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   may it affect everything that you do.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   That's what he means by "hold fast."
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   You know, at the core, when we say, "Hold fast to the gospel
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:33.000]   that was preached and that we profess,"
[00:30:33.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   first, why it deals with our grumbling is, first and foremost,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   holding on to the gospel, holding fast to the gospel
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   causes us to remember that we have absolute, eternal security.
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:50.000]   No genuine Christian is constantly living in nervousness.
[00:30:50.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   "Am I going to make it? Am I not going to make it?"
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   We're talking about, like, eternal heaven,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   like, eternal bliss versus eternal damnation, eternal.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   Hell and fire versus euphoria, you know, forever.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   Imagine living in between these two things.
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   Utter poverty and disease for eternity
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   versus winning the biggest lottery and you're living day to day,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:14.000]   like, "Oh, am I going to get this or am I going to go to..."
[00:31:14.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   He says, "No, the gospel teaches us that we have absolute security in Christ
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   because we did not earn it, we cannot lose it."
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   So holding fast to the gospel that we profess,
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:29.000]   it gives us a solid ground that can never be shaken.
[00:31:29.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   And so we celebrate what he has done.
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:36.000]   We celebrate the eternal security that we have in Christ.
[00:31:36.000 --> 00:31:40.000]   So holding on to the gospel message that we profess
[00:31:40.000 --> 00:31:43.000]   gives us the foundation that we need to build this house.
[00:31:43.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   Secondly, it assures us of his sovereignty,
[00:31:46.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   that no matter what happens, he works all things together
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   for those who have been called according to his purpose.
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   So he orchestrated everything to get us here,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   and he's also orchestrating everything to make us make sure
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   that he who began a good work in us
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   will carry it on to completion in his sovereign hands.
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:07.000]   That no matter what may be happening in your life,
[00:32:07.000 --> 00:32:09.000]   no matter what may have happened, no matter how tragic,
[00:32:09.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   no matter how confusing it is, why he is doing what he is doing,
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:16.000]   he says you are in his sovereign hands.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:22.000]   He who did not spare his own son, how will he not along with him give all things?
[00:32:22.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   If he loved you enough, if this sovereign God loved you enough
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   to give his only begotten son, why would he spare what you need?
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   Why wouldn't he protect you from what harms you?
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Why would he allow these things to happen if he gave the most and most precious thing?
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.000]   So we believe in his sovereignty,
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.000]   that despite whatever may be happening in our life,
[00:32:46.000 --> 00:32:49.000]   God is completely sovereign, and we trust him.
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.000]   And third and finally, the word of truth, the gospel,
[00:32:53.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   reminds us of the reward that's coming in Christ.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   That ultimately the gift is not what is external.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   You know, very thankful for the families who are adopting children.
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   Obviously before they're adopted, they're in foster care,
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and you have people who are temporarily taking care of them,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   and then when they come to the United States or wherever they're coming from,
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   the home that they go to usually is better.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   You know, nice home, you have loving parents, you have living in Orange County,
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   get to come to church and be loved by community, I mean, it's so much better.
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:32.000]   But when the kids come, when they're young,
[00:33:32.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   they may look at the external circumstance and the food that they have
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   and say, "Wow, this is great!"
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   But at some point in their maturity, they're going to realize
[00:33:40.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   that the real gift that they have is the parents who love them.
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   And the reason why they have everything they have
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   is because they were adopted by these loving parents.
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   And that the Scripture says that the gift of the gospel is not the external things.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   Sometimes we may have it, sometimes we may not have it.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:02.000]   But ultimately, the ultimate gift is Christ himself.
[00:34:02.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And that's why he means when Paul says in Philippians 3, 8,
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   "In view of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ,"
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:13.000]   everything else became rubbish in comparison.
[00:34:13.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   So when we hold fast to these truths,
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   and it affects our heart, and it affects our thinking,
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:23.000]   and it affects our words,
[00:34:23.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   it tends to drive out murmuring.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   And it causes people to worship.
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   And so that's what he means by constantly holding fast.
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And that's why we have the communion table.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   And that's why we sing these songs. That's why we gather together.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:48.000]   If you have a room full of murmuring people, stay away.
[00:34:48.000 --> 00:34:53.000]   People always say, "Oh, we're not united. We should have more activities to get people united."
[00:34:53.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   If you have a room full of complaining people, oh my gosh.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   Don't go there. Avoid that.
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   Just because you get a lot of people together doesn't mean there's going to be unity.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   You got a lot of people who are discontent with murmuring, complaining, and questioning,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   and you think somehow all of a sudden you're going to go there and things are going to change.
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:17.000]   No, they spread like gangrene.
[00:35:17.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   A murmuring, complaining spirit tends to spread.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And that's why the Bible says to deal with divisive people,
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   because it has a tendency to spread.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:31.000]   But if you have a room full of people worshiping God,
[00:35:31.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   thankful in their heart, have you ever had a fellowship,
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   whether it's four people or five people, they're just happy to be there.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   You may have had a bad day, all of a sudden you show up and you just forget.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   And you're like, "Oh, wow, that's right. Things are good."
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   And a fellowship of the church is meant to be a gathering of people who've been affected by the truth,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   who have come to worship God.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   So it's kind of like coming to a chiropractor.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   Any of you who've had a bad back or something, you go to a chiropractor,
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:03.000]   and they go, "Click, click, click."
[00:36:03.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   And you're like, "Oh my gosh, that feels so good."
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   And then you're able to walk, the pain goes away, and it just felt so good.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:16.000]   See, the gathering of the believers in the corporate body is kind of like a chiropractor.
[00:36:16.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   Because our natural tendency as we walk on this earth is like,
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "Oh my gosh, that guy flipped me off again. Salad for lunch? Come on.
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:26.000]   Come on, Amazon, pick up the phone."
[00:36:26.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   And then we gather together to worship, "Click, click, click."
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:35.000]   That's right. My eternity is secure.
[00:36:35.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I don't understand what's going on, but he is sovereign.
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   Oh my gosh, thank you, Jesus.
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:44.000]   That's what the corporate gathering was meant to be.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:48.000]   To recalibrate, constantly recalibrate, and to give thanks to God.
[00:36:48.000 --> 00:36:51.000]   And that's why he says, "Do not murmur."
[00:36:51.000 --> 00:36:54.000]   It is unfitting for Christians.
[00:36:54.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   But fourth and finally, he says, "We need to learn to be thankful."
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   That's not something that we just turn on and off.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   Verse 17, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering,"
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   let me stop right there.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   The book of Philippians is oftentimes titled as the book of rejoicing,
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   book of joy.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   Paul is writing this sitting in prison, chained to a Roman guard.
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   And it's not a pleasant place to be.
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   And he's writing to the people who are sitting on the outside,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   telling them to rejoice.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   When he says, "I'm being poured out as a drink offering,"
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   drink offering in the Old Testament was kind of like a benediction.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   You gave all your burnt offerings or thank offering and guilt offering.
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:42.000]   And at the very end, they would give a pour-out offering, right?
[00:37:42.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   Or drink offering.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Drink offering was kind of like a benediction.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It was the very last thing that they did.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:50.000]   So what Paul means by, "I am being poured out as a drink offering,"
[00:37:50.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   he's facing death.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:55.000]   He's sitting in prison, and I could possibly die.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   But he says, "Even though I'm being poured out as a drink offering,
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   upon the sacrifice and service of your faith."
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   He's not dying because he believed Jesus,
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   and he was quietly trying to take care of his family.
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   He said, "No, he was risking his life to go to these dangerous places
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and preach the gospel."
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   He's being stoned. He's being beaten.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:18.000]   And in the end, he actually gets beheaded, and he dies.
[00:38:18.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   So he recognizes this, and he says,
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   "Even though I'm being poured out as a drink offering for the sake of your faith,
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:28.000]   I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[00:38:28.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me."
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   I have to be honest.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I mean, I don't know how many times in the years that I've been in ministry,
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   I've thought to myself inwardly, right?
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   These people don't deserve me.
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   You can judge me, because I judge myself.
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   They don't deserve me, you selfish people.
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:59.000]   I don't want to keep doing this.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   Why does God save sinners anyway?
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   Esther knows, because I usually grumble to her.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   The greatest mystery that I have found--
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   the longer I live, I understand hell.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   I really understand hell,
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   because we don't deserve it.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   I understand why an angry God who is almighty and powerful, who is holy,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   would wipe us out and punish us for our sins.
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   I understand that.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   I don't understand why a holy God who doesn't need us
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   goes through what he goes through
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   with the constant grumbling and complaining that we do
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:43.000]   and is continuing to be patient with us.
[00:39:43.000 --> 00:39:46.000]   I don't understand. I don't get it.
[00:39:46.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   I'm so frustrated with Amazon right now.
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   [laughter]
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   I don't know how God is patient with the world for this long.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:00.000]   I don't get it.
[00:40:00.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   I'm being poured out as a drinker.
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:07.000]   I'm going to die for your faith, but he says, "I rejoice."
[00:40:07.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   How did you do that?
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:12.000]   How did that just happen?
[00:40:12.000 --> 00:40:15.000]   In 1 Thessalonians 5.18, he says, "In everything, give thanks,
[00:40:15.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   for this is God's will for you."
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   Everything?
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:21.000]   Hey, Pastor Peter, you don't know my situation.
[00:40:21.000 --> 00:40:23.000]   You don't know what I've been through.
[00:40:23.000 --> 00:40:25.000]   You don't know the kind of stuff that I've seen.
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:28.000]   And you're absolutely right. I don't know.
[00:40:28.000 --> 00:40:32.000]   But the one who wrote this does know.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:35.000]   The one who says this knows who you are.
[00:40:35.000 --> 00:40:37.000]   In fact, probably better than you.
[00:40:37.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   So when he says, "Give thanks for everything," he means everything.
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   Not just for the things that you understand.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   Not just for the things that make sense.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   Not just for the things that's going to lead to something better.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:53.000]   But he says, "Everything."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   Because our salvation is secure, our God is sovereign,
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:59.000]   and because Jesus is good.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   He says to give thanks.
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   Philippians 4.11-13, he says, "Not that I speak from want,
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:12.000]   for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am in."
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   He said, "I learned it."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:18.000]   This is a guy who was hand-picked by Jesus,
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   supernaturally converted.
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:24.000]   Holy Spirit is speaking to him, explaining the gospel to him.
[00:41:24.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   And he's explaining to the rest of the world, writing the New Testament,
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   about the grace of God, the mercy of God, the love of God.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   I mean, this is a guy who was stoned in Lystra,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:37.000]   dragged out of the city, shook off the dust,
[00:41:37.000 --> 00:41:40.000]   went back, and kept preaching.
[00:41:40.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   I mean, this is not a normal human being.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:46.000]   At least, I don't, you know, we hear stories about it.
[00:41:46.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   But this guy literally was stoned and walked back in.
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   He was ready to die.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:55.000]   And he actually died.
[00:41:55.000 --> 00:41:59.000]   And yet he says, "I learned to be content."
[00:41:59.000 --> 00:42:02.000]   "I learned to be content."
[00:42:02.000 --> 00:42:05.000]   Because that's what sanctification is.
[00:42:05.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   We hear the gospel of Jesus Christ, and we convert it.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:15.000]   We saw the glory of what that is, and we believe, and we convert it.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And then for whatever the reason, we want to be more sophisticated,
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   and then we want to learn systematic theology,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   we want to learn all this stuff. It's like, "Oh, those were young Christians."
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:27.000]   You know, you haven't been a Christian as long as I have.
[00:42:27.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   You haven't read as much as I have. You haven't experienced as much as I have.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:33.000]   But the most mature Christian is the one who is the most
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:36.000]   deeply affected by the cross.
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   Not the one who has a PhD in scholarship.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   So I'm not saying that none of that is necessary.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   The more we learn about Christ, the more we should be affected.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:48.000]   But learning itself doesn't make you mature.
[00:42:48.000 --> 00:42:51.000]   Experience itself doesn't make you mature.
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:55.000]   You can have a PhD, and you can bear a lot of fruit,
[00:42:55.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   constantly murmuring in your heart.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   And we're not really giving worship.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   We're opening up our mouth, we're singing the songs, we're attending Bible study,
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   but we're not giving worship.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:10.000]   Because worship is something that happens when we're genuinely thankful,
[00:43:10.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   and it's rising up from us.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   And it's encouraging to me to hear that Apostle Paul had to learn this.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   He learned the secret of being content
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   in every and all situations, where Christ became more valuable
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   to him as time passed than in the beginning.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:28.000]   And that's a challenge that you and I have,
[00:43:28.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   where we have a tendency to have him be so precious
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   in the beginning, and then not so much
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:37.000]   as we go along.
[00:43:37.000 --> 00:43:40.000]   He learned. So we also need to learn to be content.
[00:43:40.000 --> 00:43:43.000]   Not just once a year,
[00:43:43.000 --> 00:43:46.000]   but every day. To learn to be true worshipers
[00:43:46.000 --> 00:43:49.000]   in spirit and in truth. So let me finish with this one story
[00:43:49.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   that's always a reminder to me of encouragement.
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   You know, yesterday we had Ryan and Mel's wedding.
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   Cindy and Alex also got married in the valley.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Ryan and Mel, you know, I was intimately involved with that.
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   And so they were going back and forth,
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:07.000]   and some of you guys who know the story, because of the COVID situation,
[00:44:07.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   was not able to have their wedding where they originally planned.
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   And so up until even Saturday morning,
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:16.000]   like 3 a.m., they were scrambling, "What are we going to do? What are we going to do?"
[00:44:16.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   I said, "Well, at least maybe just have it at church, you know,
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:22.000]   and outside." And so, very last minute,
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   they were putting things together, and so we just kind of
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:28.000]   did that, and outside for people to
[00:44:28.000 --> 00:44:31.000]   guests to come and to visit. And so a lot of us were able to come and see them
[00:44:31.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   and participate in all of that. And obviously,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   I've known Mel since she was a freshman in college.
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:40.000]   I've known Ryan since he was a kid.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   So, you know, we're kind of burdened, because I wanted them to have a good wedding.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   I don't want the wedding to be something that they're going to look back years later
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   and say, "Oh my gosh, this COVID ruined our wedding."
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:52.000]   So I feel for many of our
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   members in our church who are going through that,
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:58.000]   being concerned.
[00:44:58.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   But those of you guys who participated, I mean, it went well.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   And I'm not going into the details of...
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And I really feel, and I think they would agree, that it was an answered
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:10.000]   prayer, because what we really wanted
[00:45:10.000 --> 00:45:13.000]   from the wedding actually benefited from what happened.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   Again, I'm not going to go into the details of that.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   But I'm very thankful for what happened.
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   But you know, one of the weddings that I always remember,
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   years ago, there was a couple in our church who was getting married.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:28.000]   And it was a disaster from the beginning.
[00:45:28.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   You know, we're doing counseling, you have two parents
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:34.000]   who were going back and forth of what they wanted,
[00:45:34.000 --> 00:45:37.000]   what venue they wanted, and they didn't really seem to care,
[00:45:37.000 --> 00:45:40.000]   but it was the two parents, you know, like they have a lot of opinions
[00:45:40.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   going back and forth, and they were deciding to do it at this one venue,
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   and at the very last minute, they said, "Oh, they didn't like it."
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And so they had to change. So it's like, "Okay, okay, we'll just do whatever you want."
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   And so the dad, the groom, said, "You're going to have it at our church,
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   but they don't have a nice facility.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   Their outside courtyard is uglier than ours." You know what I mean?
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   And so that's where they're going to have the reception.
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   We're going to have to, "Okay, let's just do it." And so they changed it in the last minute.
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   And then the senior pastor of the church
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   just decided on his own to invite the whole church.
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:13.000]   So he invited about 250 people,
[00:46:13.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   and it must have been like 400 or 500 people who showed up.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:19.000]   So some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:46:19.000 --> 00:46:22.000]   And so by the time we finished and went out, the real guest didn't have food to eat afterwards,
[00:46:22.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   because after we took the pictures, the church people came out,
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   and they just happened to have an event that Saturday at church,
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:31.000]   so anybody who was there ended up eating all the wedding food.
[00:46:31.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   On top of that, right before they went into the wedding,
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   the people were supposed to set up a little platform and a cover,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   like a canopy.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   The people who hired just brought it and just dumped it on the ground and said,
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   "If you want to set it up, it's going to cost you $500."
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   So they were blackmailing them. So they said, "Well, you didn't pay for the setup.
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:52.000]   You just paid for the rental."
[00:46:52.000 --> 00:46:55.000]   And so we're about to enter the wedding,
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   and obviously it's like, "Oh my gosh." And I was upset for them.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:01.000]   And so what are we going to do? So he basically got blackmailed,
[00:47:01.000 --> 00:47:04.000]   paying $500 to set it up.
[00:47:04.000 --> 00:47:07.000]   And right before the wedding started, one of the moms came up to me and said,
[00:47:07.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   "You've got to speak in Korean."
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   And so I said, "I can speak Korean, but not to that extent
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:16.000]   where I can just impromptu give a message in Korean.
[00:47:16.000 --> 00:47:19.000]   So I just do what I can."
[00:47:19.000 --> 00:47:22.000]   So I went, and I just kind of fumbled through this and that.
[00:47:22.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   I tried to translate what I was saying back and forth.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:28.000]   And I was saying, "Oh my gosh, this is horrible," from the beginning to the very end.
[00:47:28.000 --> 00:47:31.000]   Years later, I was talking to the groom,
[00:47:31.000 --> 00:47:34.000]   years later, and I said, "Hey,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   what's the happiest day that you remember?"
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:40.000]   And he said, "Oh, my wedding day."
[00:47:40.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   I'm like, "Your wedding day? Did you forget?"
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   I wanted to sit down, "Did you forget what happened at your wedding?"
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   And he said, "Oh yeah, yeah.
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:52.000]   It was difficult." I said, "So why do you say that was your happiest day?"
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:55.000]   He says, "Because I got to marry my best friend."
[00:47:55.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   And he said,
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   "Man, I was so happy that day.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   I was murmuring for him.
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:07.000]   I was upset for him. How dare they?"
[00:48:07.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   But he said it was the happiest day of his life.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   We get so caught up
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   in the external things, about the reception,
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   the food, the flowers, and all the stuff.
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   And sometimes the way that we have weddings,
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   that becomes the primary thing, and the actual marriage becomes a side issue.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   That's what we do as Christians sometimes.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   We forget what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:34.000]   We get so worried about church,
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:37.000]   about our children, about our plans, our goals.
[00:48:37.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   We get so caught up in this thing,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   and then it just sucks us dry in our worship.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   So we are busy doing things,
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   and we're neglecting what's at the core of why he saved us,
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   so that we would worship him in spirit.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:55.000]   So this constant murmuring and grumbling
[00:48:55.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   is sucking the Christians dry
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:01.000]   for what the church was meant to be, to worship.
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   So I pray that as we face Thanksgiving,
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   before Christmas,
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:10.000]   we'll give plenty of attention to Christmas after Black Friday,
[00:49:10.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   but at least this week,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   take some time to consider deeply,
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:19.000]   not the external things,
[00:49:19.000 --> 00:49:22.000]   like, "Oh, thank you for the job,"
[00:49:22.000 --> 00:49:25.000]   and "God answered my prayer for this,"
[00:49:25.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   but about what every Christian has.
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:31.000]   This God of the universe knows me,
[00:49:31.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   and he loves me, and he saves me.
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   And the worst possible case,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   worst possible case that you and I can think of right now,
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   is that we get COVID and we die.
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:46.000]   I mean, we don't want that,
[00:49:46.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   but it's probably the worst case scenario.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:52.000]   But even in the worst case scenario for a Christian,
[00:49:52.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   we get to go home early.
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:58.000]   Even though there's sadness,
[00:49:58.000 --> 00:50:01.000]   that's the worst case scenario for a Christian.
[00:50:01.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   So I pray that that reminder would cause us to worship him
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   in spirit and in truth. Let's pray.
[00:50:13.000 --> 00:50:16.000]   Gracious Father, your goodness is beyond
[00:50:16.000 --> 00:50:19.000]   what we could possibly imagine.
[00:50:19.000 --> 00:50:22.000]   I pray that a deeper contemplation
[00:50:22.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   of what it is that we have in you
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   would cause our murmuring
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:31.000]   to be radically changed to thanksgiving
[00:50:31.000 --> 00:50:34.000]   and praise of your name.
[00:50:34.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   I pray, Lord God, that in this thanksgiving season,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   as the world begins to marginalize it more and more,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   that your children help us, Lord God,
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   that we may be a light to this world
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:49.000]   so that the world may look at us and wonder,
[00:50:49.000 --> 00:50:52.000]   why are these people so thankful
[00:50:52.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   that you would give us a platform to share
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   that hope that we have in you?
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:01.000]   So we pray for your grace, we pray for your blessing. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
