[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.360]   I wanna welcome you to this morning's service.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:39.360]   Particularly if you are new, joining us for the first time,
[00:08:39.360 --> 00:08:41.360]   I wanna extend a warm welcome to you.
[00:08:41.360 --> 00:08:43.360]   Please visit our welcome booth,
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.360]   which is right at the tip of the parking lot,
[00:08:46.360 --> 00:08:49.360]   and you'll see our welcome team members in the blue jerseys.
[00:08:49.360 --> 00:08:51.360]   We'd love to meet you, get to know you,
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:53.360]   and then if you have any questions,
[00:08:53.360 --> 00:08:55.360]   they'll provide answers there.
[00:08:55.360 --> 00:08:58.360]   I would like to highlight some important announcements
[00:08:58.360 --> 00:09:00.360]   for some of the major events
[00:09:00.440 --> 00:09:02.360]   in the near future.
[00:09:02.360 --> 00:09:05.360]   First is our singles ministry.
[00:09:05.360 --> 00:09:07.360]   The BAM Christmas party is taking place
[00:09:07.360 --> 00:09:10.360]   on Saturday, December 14th.
[00:09:10.360 --> 00:09:13.360]   It's at 5.30 p.m. in the Main Sanctuary, okay?
[00:09:13.360 --> 00:09:15.360]   Here in the Main Sanctuary.
[00:09:15.360 --> 00:09:17.360]   Our planning team has requested,
[00:09:17.360 --> 00:09:20.360]   please show up in festive attire, okay?
[00:09:20.360 --> 00:09:22.360]   Be in the red, the green,
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:24.360]   and just come ready to do fellowship,
[00:09:24.360 --> 00:09:27.360]   have a great meal, and have a great time together.
[00:09:27.360 --> 00:09:29.360]   Likewise, our family ministry
[00:09:29.440 --> 00:09:32.360]   will be having their Christmas party on December 7th,
[00:09:32.360 --> 00:09:35.360]   which is Saturday at 5 p.m.,
[00:09:35.360 --> 00:09:37.360]   also here in the Main Sanctuary.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.360]   Please know there is gonna be a table booth outside
[00:09:40.360 --> 00:09:42.360]   where you can sign up,
[00:09:42.360 --> 00:09:44.360]   but today is the last day to sign up for that,
[00:09:44.360 --> 00:09:46.360]   so please make sure you take care of it.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.360]   We've been mentioning that a lot of the family teams,
[00:09:49.360 --> 00:09:51.360]   there are teams who are presenting.
[00:09:51.360 --> 00:09:54.360]   Please know that even though you're presenting,
[00:09:54.360 --> 00:09:56.360]   doesn't mean you're automatically signed up.
[00:09:56.360 --> 00:09:58.360]   We need a head count for food,
[00:09:58.440 --> 00:10:00.360]   also to know if we need babysitting,
[00:10:00.360 --> 00:10:03.360]   so please make sure to register for that.
[00:10:03.360 --> 00:10:05.360]   So then tied with that,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:07.360]   we do need help helping hands
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:10.360]   to do child care for that event on December 7th,
[00:10:10.360 --> 00:10:13.360]   so if you're available, please sign up,
[00:10:13.360 --> 00:10:16.360]   and we really appreciate the help there.
[00:10:16.360 --> 00:10:19.360]   The final announcement for today
[00:10:19.360 --> 00:10:22.360]   is that for fellowship and just building camaraderie
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   and getting to know people within the church,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.360]   we're gonna be starting our basketball season,
[00:10:27.440 --> 00:10:30.360]   which will start January 5th at the Great Park.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.360]   We do have both men's and women's league,
[00:10:33.360 --> 00:10:36.360]   and all kind of people of different skill level
[00:10:36.360 --> 00:10:38.360]   are welcome to participate.
[00:10:38.360 --> 00:10:40.360]   It is for fellowship within the church,
[00:10:40.360 --> 00:10:42.360]   and therefore, because it's scheduled teams
[00:10:42.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   and a scheduled season,
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:46.360]   it is open for members only.
[00:10:46.360 --> 00:10:50.360]   There will be a table outside for sign-ups for that event.
[00:10:50.360 --> 00:10:53.360]   Okay, at this time, we'll go into time of offering.
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:10:55.360]   If you do have a physical check,
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:10:58.360]   we have a drop box right there by the main entrance.
[00:10:58.360 --> 00:11:00.360]   Otherwise, you can go ahead and give that online.
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.360]   Let's take a moment to pray together.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:05.360]   Lord God, as we look forward
[00:11:05.360 --> 00:11:09.360]   to this whole week of Thanksgiving,
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.360]   and we have today this service before you,
[00:11:12.360 --> 00:11:14.360]   with our joined voices, with our hearts,
[00:11:14.360 --> 00:11:16.360]   we want to thank you, God.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:19.360]   You are so tremendously good to us,
[00:11:19.360 --> 00:11:21.360]   generous beyond anything we deserve
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:23.360]   and far more than we could ask for.
[00:11:23.440 --> 00:11:25.360]   In all these ways, Father,
[00:11:25.360 --> 00:11:27.360]   you lavish us with your love,
[00:11:27.360 --> 00:11:29.360]   and truly, Lord, we thank you.
[00:11:29.360 --> 00:11:31.360]   We ask, God, that you would continue
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   to build within us such a faith
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   where we can see you not just simply
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:37.360]   working in the past, but today.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:39.360]   And therefore, God, we would continue, then,
[00:11:39.360 --> 00:11:41.360]   to have such a growing sentiment
[00:11:41.360 --> 00:11:43.360]   of gratitude in our lives.
[00:11:43.360 --> 00:11:45.360]   We offer you, Lord God, this morning
[00:11:45.360 --> 00:11:49.360]   just simple time, our attention, our ears,
[00:11:49.360 --> 00:11:51.360]   but also, Lord, our finances
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:53.360]   with a heart of gratitude,
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.360]   acknowledging, Lord, that you have been so good.
[00:11:55.360 --> 00:11:58.360]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:11:58.360 --> 00:12:01.280]   (gentle piano music)
[00:12:02.200 --> 00:12:05.200]   (gentle piano music)

[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:09.960]   That's a great song.
[00:22:09.960 --> 00:22:11.960]   Please take your Bible
[00:22:11.960 --> 00:22:16.960]   and turn over to Book of Exodus, chapter 15.
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:23.960]   Today, as we are looking forward to our Thanksgiving week,
[00:22:23.960 --> 00:22:26.960]   our various, you know, family meals
[00:22:26.960 --> 00:22:29.960]   and special occasions,
[00:22:29.960 --> 00:22:32.960]   we want to take time to give thanks to the Lord
[00:22:32.960 --> 00:22:35.960]   and meditate on what it means to have a thankful heart
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:38.960]   in every single circumstance.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   Here, jumping down into immediately
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   after coming out of Egypt
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:46.960]   and being delivered from the chariots of Pharaoh,
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:48.960]   Moses writes a song.
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.960]   And in verse 1 of chapter 15, it says,
[00:22:51.960 --> 00:22:53.960]   "Then Moses and the sons of Israel
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:22:55.960]   sang this song to the Lord and said,
[00:22:55.960 --> 00:22:59.960]   'I will sing to the Lord, for He is highly exalted.
[00:22:59.960 --> 00:23:02.960]   The horse and its rider He has hurled into the sea.
[00:23:02.960 --> 00:23:04.960]   The Lord is my strength and song,
[00:23:04.960 --> 00:23:07.960]   and He has become my salvation.
[00:23:07.960 --> 00:23:09.960]   This is my God. I will praise Him.
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:12.960]   My Father's God, I will extol Him.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:15.960]   The Lord is a warrior. The Lord is His name.'"
[00:23:15.960 --> 00:23:17.960]   Let's pray.
[00:23:17.960 --> 00:23:20.960]   Father, we pray, God,
[00:23:20.960 --> 00:23:23.960]   that You would grant to us
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:26.960]   a growing understanding and depth of faith
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:30.960]   where we can just continue to see more details,
[00:23:30.960 --> 00:23:33.960]   continue to see greater aspects
[00:23:33.960 --> 00:23:35.960]   of Your goodness, love, and glory
[00:23:35.960 --> 00:23:38.960]   throughout the history and throughout our lives.
[00:23:38.960 --> 00:23:41.960]   And in so doing, God, cause us to be so worshipful
[00:23:41.960 --> 00:23:43.960]   and so thankful to You.
[00:23:43.960 --> 00:23:46.960]   This we pray in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:23:46.960 --> 00:23:52.960]   So as we think about, you know, again, Thanksgiving, etc.,
[00:23:52.960 --> 00:23:56.960]   I really do appreciate having these set times and seasons,
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:58.960]   basically holidays.
[00:23:58.960 --> 00:24:00.960]   It sets up for good tradition.
[00:24:00.960 --> 00:24:02.960]   And I see it as a good thing,
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:05.960]   not like a burden or nothing but tradition.
[00:24:05.960 --> 00:24:07.960]   I see it as a really, really great thing.
[00:24:07.960 --> 00:24:11.960]   And in our family, we try to hold the tradition,
[00:24:11.960 --> 00:24:13.960]   we try to get together as a family,
[00:24:13.960 --> 00:24:16.960]   and we make sure not to bypass Thanksgiving.
[00:24:16.960 --> 00:24:20.960]   So no premature Christmas celebration, right?
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:22.960]   We still sing Christmas songs, etc.
[00:24:22.960 --> 00:24:24.960]   We're actually prepping for, you know, the next season, etc.,
[00:24:24.960 --> 00:24:28.960]   but we try to make sure that doesn't become a quick bypass
[00:24:28.960 --> 00:24:30.960]   as we honor our way to Christmas, so to speak,
[00:24:30.960 --> 00:24:35.960]   because it is really a special time to thank the Lord.
[00:24:35.960 --> 00:24:39.960]   Now, in so doing, you know, please, just as a request,
[00:24:39.960 --> 00:24:42.960]   there's a lot of people that call it Harvest Festival,
[00:24:42.960 --> 00:24:44.960]   and we're going to have a Harvest Festival, etc.
[00:24:44.960 --> 00:24:48.960]   I get it, but every religion has a Harvest Festival, you know.
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:50.960]   Did you know the Greeks have one, the Romans have one,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:52.960]   Koreans have one, the Chinese have one,
[00:24:52.960 --> 00:24:55.960]   and it's basically a generic thank you for,
[00:24:55.960 --> 00:24:58.960]   as long as they've had, you know, agriculture, farming,
[00:24:58.960 --> 00:25:02.960]   there was a thank you to the lords, the gods of the universe,
[00:25:02.960 --> 00:25:05.960]   for providing a great, great time of harvest,
[00:25:05.960 --> 00:25:08.960]   you know, abundant in the crops.
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:10.960]   But for us, we're American.
[00:25:10.960 --> 00:25:12.960]   I'm just kidding.
[00:25:12.960 --> 00:25:14.960]   I'm kidding, I'm kidding.
[00:25:14.960 --> 00:25:18.960]   We have this privilege to celebrate a holiday
[00:25:18.960 --> 00:25:22.960]   that was based off those individuals who came to this land,
[00:25:22.960 --> 00:25:25.960]   a lot of it by faith.
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:27.960]   And doing a quick review of history,
[00:25:27.960 --> 00:25:29.960]   it is an American tradition,
[00:25:29.960 --> 00:25:33.960]   and in that way, it is just that,
[00:25:33.960 --> 00:25:35.960]   but to us, it can be something so much more.
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:38.960]   We can take this opportunity to encourage
[00:25:38.960 --> 00:25:42.960]   and rejuvenate our hearts of thanksgiving and faith unto God.
[00:25:42.960 --> 00:25:44.960]   Thinking back, you recall, yes,
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:48.960]   like what we learned in a snippet during our elementary days
[00:25:48.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   and during our high school days, etc.,
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:53.960]   individuals on the Mayflower came to the U.S.
[00:25:53.960 --> 00:25:58.960]   with hopes of liberty, to have religious freedom, yes?
[00:25:58.960 --> 00:26:01.960]   And maybe that's all that we can think about
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:02.960]   or that's all we remember,
[00:26:02.960 --> 00:26:06.960]   and we also know that they had a meal with a local tribe
[00:26:06.960 --> 00:26:09.960]   because this tribe actually helped them survive.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:13.960]   And so in thanksgiving to God, they had a feast together.
[00:26:13.960 --> 00:26:15.960]   That is too short of a summary
[00:26:15.960 --> 00:26:18.960]   to really appreciate what had happened, right?
[00:26:18.960 --> 00:26:24.960]   Because back in 1620, yes, they embarked on this great journey,
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:26.960]   but on this great journey,
[00:26:26.960 --> 00:26:30.960]   many people died before they ever got to the land.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:32.960]   And what's more, they were set out for Virginia,
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:36.960]   but they landed in Massachusetts, and the winter was harsh.
[00:26:36.960 --> 00:26:39.960]   And so by the time they survived through the winter,
[00:26:39.960 --> 00:26:43.960]   and it was the spring of 1621,
[00:26:43.960 --> 00:26:46.960]   more than half the people on the boat that came over,
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:52.960]   there was 102 individuals, more than half died, okay?
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:26:54.960]   If you were a leader in this group,
[00:26:54.960 --> 00:26:57.960]   you would think you were an incredible failure.
[00:26:57.960 --> 00:26:59.960]   The stories are tragic,
[00:26:59.960 --> 00:27:02.960]   and the stories are actually incredibly saddening
[00:27:02.960 --> 00:27:09.960]   because pretty much every family had somebody within their family die,
[00:27:09.960 --> 00:27:13.960]   and a lot of them, because it was the harsh winter, were kids.
[00:27:13.960 --> 00:27:15.960]   They buried their children.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:17.960]   So if you were a leader in this group,
[00:27:17.960 --> 00:27:19.960]   I want you to take a moment to think about this.
[00:27:19.960 --> 00:27:23.960]   You would see this as a miserable failure.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:25.960]   You wouldn't see this as an occasion to be like,
[00:27:25.960 --> 00:27:30.960]   "Bless the Lord. Let's have a feast."
[00:27:30.960 --> 00:27:33.960]   My personal just sentiment about this is
[00:27:33.960 --> 00:27:40.960]   it took Christian faith to give thanks in that kind of circumstance, right?
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:45.960]   And you guys know because probably you were forced to read the Mayflower Compact, etc.,
[00:27:45.960 --> 00:27:50.960]   that embedded into this endeavor was the ideas, the principles of God,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:55.960]   more than just simply escaping religious oppression.
[00:27:55.960 --> 00:27:58.960]   For example, if you take the very first portion of that Mayflower Compact,
[00:27:58.960 --> 00:28:01.960]   it reads, "In the name of God, amen.
[00:28:01.960 --> 00:28:04.960]   We whose names are underwritten," so forth,
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:11.960]   "have undertaken for the glory of God and the advancement of the Christian faith this honor."
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:14.960]   That's very different from just saying like, "Oh, there was a bunch of separatists.
[00:28:14.960 --> 00:28:16.960]   They just escaped," right?
[00:28:16.960 --> 00:28:18.960]   And the reason why I'm saying this is because
[00:28:18.960 --> 00:28:23.960]   if we take time to meditate and just to imagine,
[00:28:23.960 --> 00:28:27.960]   can you imagine coming to an unknown territory,
[00:28:27.960 --> 00:28:30.960]   seeing just unknown individuals, all that kind of stuff,
[00:28:30.960 --> 00:28:36.960]   and then seeing half of the people you love die in front of you, you burying them?
[00:28:36.960 --> 00:28:38.960]   You would have just given up.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:39.960]   I would have given up.
[00:28:39.960 --> 00:28:43.960]   I would have thought, "This wasn't blessed by God.
[00:28:43.960 --> 00:28:46.960]   Maybe we should go back."
[00:28:46.960 --> 00:28:52.960]   I would have thought, like, "I regret the fact that I asked you guys to come with me," so to speak.
[00:28:52.960 --> 00:28:56.960]   But instead, for those who survived,
[00:28:56.960 --> 00:29:00.960]   William Bradford, who was the first governor of that Plymouth colony,
[00:29:00.960 --> 00:29:03.960]   he starts to write and say, "Bless the Lord.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:05.960]   He's provided for us.
[00:29:05.960 --> 00:29:06.960]   Bless the Lord.
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.960]   He sustained us who remain."
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:15.960]   And so that Thanksgiving was an incredible act of faith to say in the midst of what I see,
[00:29:15.960 --> 00:29:20.960]   and what I see is we could still die, right?
[00:29:20.960 --> 00:29:23.960]   There are no guarantees.
[00:29:23.960 --> 00:29:27.960]   What I see is actually the graves of the people I love.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:31.960]   But what I see is God.
[00:29:31.960 --> 00:29:33.960]   And so they're giving thanks to the Lord.
[00:29:33.960 --> 00:29:37.960]   This, to me, is incredibly encouraging.
[00:29:37.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   To be able to say good and perfect gifts come from the hand of God
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:43.960]   in a time when you're suffering,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:48.960]   in a time when your agenda, like your vision, your great project,
[00:29:48.960 --> 00:29:52.960]   looks like it's like a two-thirds failure,
[00:29:52.960 --> 00:29:55.960]   it takes an incredible amount of faith to give thanks in that kind of scenario.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.960]   And so the challenge to us is can we exercise that kind of foundational faith
[00:30:01.960 --> 00:30:06.960]   to thank the Lord in every instance, every circumstance?
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:08.960]   And in answering that question,
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:13.960]   I immediately thought about the people in the Exodus generation, right?
[00:30:13.960 --> 00:30:16.960]   You have people who were enslaved for 400 years.
[00:30:16.960 --> 00:30:19.960]   They saw their family members pass.
[00:30:19.960 --> 00:30:23.960]   They saw their grandpa, their dads, their uncles get buried in the buildings
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:26.960]   and the structures and the statues.
[00:30:26.960 --> 00:30:28.960]   It would have been logical.
[00:30:28.960 --> 00:30:31.960]   It would have been the kind of, you know,
[00:30:31.960 --> 00:30:35.960]   just makes-sense conclusion to think we're all gone.
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.960]   There's no hope for us.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:41.960]   But in crying out to the Lord, they receive mercy,
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:44.960]   and they give thanks for deliverance.
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.960]   For us, we have a foundation that is not just positive thinking.
[00:30:48.960 --> 00:30:50.960]   It's not just, "Hey, guys, count your blessings."
[00:30:50.960 --> 00:30:55.960]   It's not a facade of just, like, trying to say the good stuff.
[00:30:55.960 --> 00:30:57.960]   For Christians, we have such a foundation of hope
[00:30:57.960 --> 00:30:59.960]   where we can give thanks in every circumstance.
[00:30:59.960 --> 00:31:00.960]   Amen?
[00:31:00.960 --> 00:31:02.960]   So in thinking about this,
[00:31:02.960 --> 00:31:06.960]   how can we have such a deep-seated gratitude in our heart?
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:13.960]   Point one, you remember how much you personally have been forgiven, okay?
[00:31:13.960 --> 00:31:16.960]   You think about where you've come from.
[00:31:16.960 --> 00:31:21.960]   You recall the depths and the pit and the darkness from which God has rescued you.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   You remember the B.C. days, okay?
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:29.960]   And you take time to see and not necessarily appreciate
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.960]   but value the weight of sacrifice of the Lord.
[00:31:34.960 --> 00:31:40.960]   And this should come natural to us, but sometimes we're just so forgetful.
[00:31:40.960 --> 00:31:45.960]   And I would say perhaps sometimes the greatest threat
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:48.960]   to us having an ongoing thankful heart
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:51.960]   is just getting so fixated on all the stuff that's going around us
[00:31:51.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   and all the stuff that's before us,
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:57.960]   we completely lose sight of the things before.
[00:31:57.960 --> 00:31:59.960]   And God knows this.
[00:31:59.960 --> 00:32:01.960]   God knew it.
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:06.960]   Turn your Bible over to Exodus 12:25.
[00:32:06.960 --> 00:32:11.960]   In ministering to these individuals, the promised people of God,
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.960]   God prepared them before He delivered them, right?
[00:32:16.960 --> 00:32:19.960]   Before that He actually pulled them out of Egypt,
[00:32:19.960 --> 00:32:23.960]   He did His works of miracles, and then He spoke to them.
[00:32:23.960 --> 00:32:27.960]   And He prepared their mind and their reactions for the time that they'll come out.
[00:32:27.960 --> 00:32:30.960]   So think about that, okay?
[00:32:30.960 --> 00:32:34.960]   The way He prepared them was to challenge them not to forget.
[00:32:34.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   First, in Exodus 12, He gave the instructions for the Passover.
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:44.960]   And in verse 25, He says, "So when you enter that land which the Lord will give you,
[00:32:44.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   as He promised, you shall observe this rite."
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:51.960]   So this is tradition.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:53.960]   This is ongoing ritual.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:55.960]   And everybody was supposed to do it.
[00:32:55.960 --> 00:33:00.960]   There was not supposed to be a man or child missing this dinner.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:01.960]   And it was the Passover.
[00:33:01.960 --> 00:33:05.960]   "And when your children say to you, 'What does this rite mean to you?'
[00:33:05.960 --> 00:33:08.960]   You shall say, 'It is a Passover sacrifice to the Lord,
[00:33:08.960 --> 00:33:12.960]   who passed over the houses of the sons of Israel in Egypt,
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.960]   when He smote the Egyptians, but spared your homes.'
[00:33:16.960 --> 00:33:21.960]   And the people bowed low and worshipped."
[00:33:21.960 --> 00:33:25.960]   Whenever we do Passover meal here at church, I always remind everybody every year,
[00:33:25.960 --> 00:33:32.960]   remember the greatest mistake we make in not remembering history correctly
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   is to think, "Yeah, those Egyptians, God really got them."
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:36.960]   No, no, no, no.
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:40.960]   You were this close.
[00:33:40.960 --> 00:33:43.960]   You weren't so much spared from the wrath of the Egyptians.
[00:33:43.960 --> 00:33:45.960]   You were spared from the wrath of God.
[00:33:45.960 --> 00:33:49.960]   And you were this close.
[00:33:49.960 --> 00:33:52.960]   If you did not have the blood of the Lamb over you,
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:57.960]   if God did not tell you to quickly go, you too would have perished, right?
[00:33:57.960 --> 00:34:01.960]   And what's more, embedded into that Passover dinner,
[00:34:01.960 --> 00:34:06.960]   did you know that there was another feast on top of the already feast?
[00:34:06.960 --> 00:34:10.960]   And my point is God knew we were going to forget.
[00:34:10.960 --> 00:34:16.960]   So if you just look down in chapter 12, actually look up verse 14.
[00:34:16.960 --> 00:34:23.960]   As I'm looking at Exodus 12, 14, there is another feast laid upon an already feast.
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:28.960]   It says in verse 14, "Now this day will be a memorial to you,
[00:34:28.960 --> 00:34:31.960]   and you shall celebrate it as a feast of the Lord throughout your generations."
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.960]   You're to celebrate it as a permanent ordinance.
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:37.960]   "Seven days you shall eat unleavened bread,
[00:34:37.960 --> 00:34:40.960]   but on the first day you shall remove leaven from your house.
[00:34:40.960 --> 00:34:43.960]   For whoever eats anything leavened from the first day until the seventh,
[00:34:43.960 --> 00:34:47.960]   that person shall be cut off."
[00:34:47.960 --> 00:34:52.960]   So even to this day, the Jewish community practiced this, the feast of unleavened bread.
[00:34:52.960 --> 00:34:56.960]   Do you know what that was supposed to remind you?
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:35:01.960]   What he said was, "Remember, you're not supposed to wait for the leaven to rise, the bread,
[00:35:01.960 --> 00:35:05.960]   because judgment is coming and you need to escape."
[00:35:05.960 --> 00:35:09.960]   And what's more, removing the leaven from your own house represented a second fact,
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:13.960]   which is that dirtiness, the thing that permeates.
[00:35:13.960 --> 00:35:14.960]   Where is it?
[00:35:14.960 --> 00:35:16.960]   Is it on the Egyptian soldiers?
[00:35:16.960 --> 00:35:18.960]   Is it on the slave masters?
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:20.960]   It's in your house.
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:24.960]   Do you understand and remember what you've been saved from?
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:25.960]   And it goes on.
[00:35:25.960 --> 00:35:32.960]   Did you know that there was another feast or a kind of ceremony embedded on top of that?
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:35.960]   In Exodus chapter 13, please take a moment to look there.
[00:35:35.960 --> 00:35:41.960]   Exodus 13, verse 2, there is something called the redemption of the firstborn.
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:44.960]   And the Jewish people practice this even today.
[00:35:44.960 --> 00:35:50.960]   It says, "Sanctify to me every firstborn, the first offspring of every womb,
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.960]   among the sons of Israel, both man and beast."
[00:35:53.960 --> 00:35:56.960]   Why? Because it belongs to me.
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:00.960]   "And Moses said to the people, 'Remember this day in which you went out from Egypt,
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:07.960]   from the house of slavery, by a powerful hand the Lord brought you out from this place.'"
[00:36:07.960 --> 00:36:10.960]   What was that supposed to remind us of?
[00:36:10.960 --> 00:36:16.960]   That the judgment of God took the life of the most -- in that culture, as you know,
[00:36:16.960 --> 00:36:20.960]   the firstborn had the first rights and represent the family.
[00:36:20.960 --> 00:36:23.960]   Sin required death.
[00:36:23.960 --> 00:36:25.960]   God owned that life.
[00:36:25.960 --> 00:36:28.960]   It's God's, okay?
[00:36:28.960 --> 00:36:30.960]   And you're thinking, "Whoa, I didn't know this,
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:36.960]   that God, from the moment that he was delivering those people from Egypt,
[00:36:36.960 --> 00:36:42.960]   that he stacked on one another these various religious rights and ordinances to never forget."
[00:36:42.960 --> 00:36:44.960]   And just in case you did, do you know what he said?
[00:36:44.960 --> 00:36:46.960]   Take a look at verse 16.
[00:36:46.960 --> 00:36:50.960]   Exodus 13, verse 16.
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:57.960]   "So it shall serve as a sign on your hand and as phylacteries on your forehead,
[00:36:57.960 --> 00:37:03.960]   for with a powerful hand the Lord brought us out of Egypt."
[00:37:03.960 --> 00:37:09.960]   If you look up Teflon on the Google, what you'll see is the Jewish community,
[00:37:09.960 --> 00:37:12.960]   they have a band with scripture inscribed,
[00:37:12.960 --> 00:37:16.960]   and they wrap it around their hand with a box at the top, right on their bicep,
[00:37:16.960 --> 00:37:20.960]   so that just in case they forgot, they could be like, okay.
[00:37:20.960 --> 00:37:22.960]   It would be to them like the watch.
[00:37:22.960 --> 00:37:26.960]   And what's more, they have a decorative box right here with a band around their head.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:28.960]   They do this at this time of the Passover.
[00:37:28.960 --> 00:37:30.960]   They do this whenever they go to the wall.
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:33.960]   They do this all the time just in case, forget,
[00:37:33.960 --> 00:37:39.960]   they have inscriptions of the scriptures put into a box on their forehead.
[00:37:39.960 --> 00:37:43.960]   Okay, let's take a moment and meditate on this.
[00:37:43.960 --> 00:37:47.960]   Doesn't that just strike you as so odd?
[00:37:47.960 --> 00:37:49.960]   Doesn't it?
[00:37:49.960 --> 00:37:56.960]   You have to meditate and imagine you're a normal person who used to be a slave in Egypt,
[00:37:56.960 --> 00:37:59.960]   and you're standing there hearing Moses talk,
[00:37:59.960 --> 00:38:01.960]   and you just saw water turn into blood.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:05.960]   You just saw gnats come out of everywhere and people's mouths and all that stuff.
[00:38:05.960 --> 00:38:06.960]   You saw a frog.
[00:38:06.960 --> 00:38:09.960]   You saw the straight sun turn black.
[00:38:09.960 --> 00:38:13.960]   You heard the wailings go through the entire land.
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.960]   You heard people crying like it says like never before.
[00:38:16.960 --> 00:38:19.960]   It was a devastating scene.
[00:38:19.960 --> 00:38:24.960]   And then God's telling you, "Don't forget this.
[00:38:24.960 --> 00:38:27.960]   And just in case you forget, here's a box for you.
[00:38:27.960 --> 00:38:29.960]   And just in case you forget, you have to eat this stale bread.
[00:38:29.960 --> 00:38:32.960]   And just in case you forget, everybody has to sit, and you have to gird your loins.
[00:38:32.960 --> 00:38:35.960]   And just in case," and you're like, "Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:38.960]   Trust me, I'm never going to forget."
[00:38:38.960 --> 00:38:40.960]   Isn't that what you would say?
[00:38:40.960 --> 00:38:41.960]   That's what I would have said.
[00:38:41.960 --> 00:38:43.960]   I would have gotten incredibly annoyed.
[00:38:43.960 --> 00:38:45.960]   Like, what is this?
[00:38:45.960 --> 00:38:47.960]   Seven days?
[00:38:47.960 --> 00:38:49.960]   Seven days of festivities?
[00:38:49.960 --> 00:38:52.960]   On top of that, we have to sacrifice a precious lamb?
[00:38:52.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   On top of that, we have to bring this and bring that?
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:38:56.960]   God, God, God.
[00:38:56.960 --> 00:38:58.960]   Moses, knock it off.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:38:59.960]   We're not going to forget.
[00:38:59.960 --> 00:39:02.960]   That's crazy what we just saw.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:05.960]   But you and I know the history.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.960]   Literally, they come out and they forget.
[00:39:08.960 --> 00:39:12.960]   Literally, they come out and they forget.
[00:39:12.960 --> 00:39:19.960]   And so I pray that as we go into the Thanksgiving season, may we never forget the depths of
[00:39:19.960 --> 00:39:21.960]   our own sin.
[00:39:21.960 --> 00:39:26.960]   I pray that we would not be so busy that we look up at God and say, "Oh, the season
[00:39:26.960 --> 00:39:28.960]   has passed.
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:30.960]   I forgot to stop and thank the Lord."
[00:39:30.960 --> 00:39:32.960]   Right?
[00:39:32.960 --> 00:39:37.960]   I pray that we would not be so consumed with, "This is the time to buy everybody their
[00:39:37.960 --> 00:39:38.960]   Christmas gifts."
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:39.960]   And if you do that, great.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.960]   You're thinking ahead.
[00:39:40.960 --> 00:39:43.960]   Get that deal.
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:55.960]   But I pray we would never forget because for these individuals, not even a year, not even
[00:39:55.960 --> 00:40:01.960]   six months, not even three months, the first month they come out and they start walking
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:04.960]   and all they see is the desert sand.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:09.960]   All they see is the marauders and the bandits and the other nations and all they see is
[00:40:09.960 --> 00:40:10.960]   like, "Wait a minute.
[00:40:10.960 --> 00:40:12.960]   Where's the water?"
[00:40:12.960 --> 00:40:14.960]   They forget.
[00:40:14.960 --> 00:40:17.960]   May we keep praying that we don't forget.
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:18.960]   Amen?
[00:40:18.960 --> 00:40:21.960]   Because for us, God knew that we would forget too.
[00:40:21.960 --> 00:40:26.960]   And so in every book of the New Testament, it typically starts off with, "Do you understand
[00:40:26.960 --> 00:40:32.960]   the depth and the riches of the mercies of God and how you were once dead in your trespasses
[00:40:32.960 --> 00:40:36.960]   and you're walking with everybody and the sons of disobedience and you're just children
[00:40:36.960 --> 00:40:39.960]   of wrath with the mercies of God?"
[00:40:39.960 --> 00:40:46.960]   And if you turn your eyes to Ephesians 2, verse 11, Ephesians 2, 11, it says, "So therefore
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:54.960]   remember that you formerly, the Gentiles in the flesh, who are called uncircumcision by
[00:40:54.960 --> 00:41:01.960]   the so-called circumcision, which is performed by the flesh by the human hands, remember."
[00:41:01.960 --> 00:41:04.960]   It told you, "Remember who you were formerly."
[00:41:04.960 --> 00:41:08.960]   And then he says again, "Remember," verse 12, "that you were at that time separate from
[00:41:08.960 --> 00:41:13.960]   Christ, excluded from the commonwealth of Israel, strangers to the covenants of promise,
[00:41:13.960 --> 00:41:16.960]   having no hope without God in the world.
[00:41:16.960 --> 00:41:22.960]   But now in Christ Jesus, you who were formerly far, far off, have been brought near by the
[00:41:22.960 --> 00:41:23.960]   blood of Christ."
[00:41:23.960 --> 00:41:26.960]   It was a problem in the New Testament.
[00:41:26.960 --> 00:41:32.960]   Bunch of Gentiles who had no common grace saying, "Of course I'm a child of God."
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:37.960]   And getting all snooty and looking down on the Jewish people.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:43.960]   May we never become so forgetful that we just assume the graces of God.
[00:41:43.960 --> 00:41:44.960]   Amen?
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:52.960]   Here in the New Testament, I confess that this is a problem too.
[00:41:52.960 --> 00:41:57.960]   Confess that now that I've been Christian for, you know, actually just the other day
[00:41:57.960 --> 00:42:02.960]   I was in youth group and I saw some old photos of myself.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:07.960]   And what I was trying to show them was that the style, it just recycles.
[00:42:07.960 --> 00:42:11.960]   And I said, "Dude, I see a bunch of you guys wearing big baggy clothes."
[00:42:11.960 --> 00:42:14.960]   I used to do the same, so I showed them a photo.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:17.960]   And I showed them a photo, they were like, "Whoa, why are you wearing that?"
[00:42:17.960 --> 00:42:21.960]   You know, I had like double X large T-shirts, baggy pants, et cetera, you know.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.960]   And it just started to like well up in me like, "Oh my gosh."
[00:42:25.960 --> 00:42:30.960]   At that time, I was just basically a juvenile delinquent, right?
[00:42:30.960 --> 00:42:38.960]   I was just deserving of nothing, living my life with nothing but lust for money, girls,
[00:42:38.960 --> 00:42:41.960]   and popularity, and nice clothes, you know.
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:43.960]   As a little old me.
[00:42:43.960 --> 00:42:48.960]   But even then, I realized I don't know if my thankfulness goes deep enough.
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:57.960]   Because as you recall, Jesus told the generation this principle, "Much forgiven, you will love much."
[00:42:57.960 --> 00:43:02.960]   Pastor Peter has been walking through the Gospel of Luke, and you recall in Luke chapter 7,
[00:43:02.960 --> 00:43:04.960]   there was the woman who came.
[00:43:04.960 --> 00:43:07.960]   Everybody saw her as defiled.
[00:43:07.960 --> 00:43:10.960]   But she came with the oil that was so precious to her.
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.960]   She broke it, she anointed him, she tried to take her hair and wash his feet with her tears,
[00:43:15.960 --> 00:43:20.960]   and then she ended up kissing his feet, and a bunch of the people around him were looking at Jesus and saying,
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:26.960]   "This guy's not a prophet because if he was, he would know how dirty this woman is."
[00:43:26.960 --> 00:43:28.960]   Do you remember that?
[00:43:28.960 --> 00:43:32.960]   And then Jesus looked at his disciples and said, "Simon, I got a question for you.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:37.960]   Who do you think will be more thankful, the man who was forgiven a hundred or thousands?"
[00:43:37.960 --> 00:43:41.960]   And Simon was like, "Easy, the thousands."
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:45.960]   This woman loves much because she's been forgiven much.
[00:43:45.960 --> 00:43:48.960]   And I'm so challenged during this season.
[00:43:48.960 --> 00:43:52.960]   God has forgiven us so much.
[00:43:52.960 --> 00:44:00.960]   I think about just this fact, the whole question of if our God, and I knew that even with 15 festivals,
[00:44:00.960 --> 00:44:06.960]   but more, 20 religious acts, but more, all of this ritualistic thing you do, but more,
[00:44:06.960 --> 00:44:13.960]   even text that you're supposed to tell your kids, "Hey, ask me. Ask me why I do this."
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:16.960]   And they forget.
[00:44:16.960 --> 00:44:20.960]   I pray that my thankfulness would be so deep.
[00:44:20.960 --> 00:44:23.960]   I pray that my gratitude from my Lord would be so deep,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:27.960]   that during this time when I get together a family and I try to teach my kids,
[00:44:27.960 --> 00:44:31.960]   I don't just teach them good etiquette.
[00:44:31.960 --> 00:44:33.960]   Remember to say thank you.
[00:44:33.960 --> 00:44:38.960]   You say, "Thank you, Noma," for a piece of turkey, you know.
[00:44:38.960 --> 00:44:43.960]   I pray I would sit them down, and I would sit them and just be welling up with,
[00:44:43.960 --> 00:44:51.960]   "Do you have any idea how good God has been to our family, to my church?
[00:44:51.960 --> 00:44:58.960]   Do you have any idea how God has been so patient with such a forgetful people,
[00:44:58.960 --> 00:45:02.960]   who just run off and go take care of their homes, take care of their lives,
[00:45:02.960 --> 00:45:08.960]   take care of everything about them, but forget the God who gave them life?
[00:45:08.960 --> 00:45:13.960]   Do you have any idea how good God is? Amen?"
[00:45:13.960 --> 00:45:24.960]   Point two, in having this heart of gratitude, God must truly be your all in all.
[00:45:24.960 --> 00:45:29.960]   God must truly be your all in all.
[00:45:29.960 --> 00:45:34.960]   Many good pastors, both from like Pastor John Piper and Pastor MacArthur,
[00:45:34.960 --> 00:45:41.960]   when I read some of their commentaries, they say things like this,
[00:45:41.960 --> 00:45:47.960]   "We are a people who are way too easily satisfied.
[00:45:47.960 --> 00:45:52.960]   You're a people who are satisfied with having nice clothes, nice house, nice friends,
[00:45:52.960 --> 00:45:57.960]   but you don't realize that when you do that to yourself, you ruin yourself.
[00:45:57.960 --> 00:45:59.960]   You set yourself up for destruction.
[00:45:59.960 --> 00:46:04.960]   You set yourself up for disappointment because everything in life does not last,
[00:46:04.960 --> 00:46:07.960]   including even good things.
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.960]   Your wife, amazing gift of God, does not last forever.
[00:46:11.960 --> 00:46:13.960]   There is no marriage in heaven.
[00:46:13.960 --> 00:46:17.960]   Your children, amazing gift from God, children are a gift from the Lord,
[00:46:17.960 --> 00:46:19.960]   does not last forever.
[00:46:19.960 --> 00:46:22.960]   At 1822, they leave the house.
[00:46:22.960 --> 00:46:27.960]   But when God is your all in all, you set yourself up for true satisfaction.
[00:46:27.960 --> 00:46:29.960]   Amen?
[00:46:29.960 --> 00:46:32.960]   And Scripture tells us that this is what we need to hear.
[00:46:32.960 --> 00:46:36.960]   This is what we need to know and feel so that we would have a thankfulness
[00:46:36.960 --> 00:46:40.960]   that overflows in any circumstance.
[00:46:40.960 --> 00:46:46.960]   And Moses, the leader of the people, he sings this when deliverance happens.
[00:46:46.960 --> 00:46:49.960]   So chapter 12, he prepared them.
[00:46:49.960 --> 00:46:52.960]   Chapter 13, chapter 14, the deliverance is happening,
[00:46:52.960 --> 00:46:57.960]   and all the drama of the chariots chasing, they hit the wall of the water, et cetera.
[00:46:57.960 --> 00:47:00.960]   And then here in chapter 15 is his praise.
[00:47:00.960 --> 00:47:04.960]   The passage I read earlier was chapter 15, verse 1 through 3,
[00:47:04.960 --> 00:47:08.960]   "Then Moses and the sons of Israel sang this song to the Lord and said,
[00:47:08.960 --> 00:47:14.960]   'I will sing to the Lord, for he has highly exalted the horse and its rider.
[00:47:14.960 --> 00:47:17.960]   He has hurled into the sea.
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   The Lord is my strength and song, and he has become my salvation.'"
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:29.960]   Moses doesn't just see the water that split.
[00:47:29.960 --> 00:47:32.960]   Moses doesn't just see the chariots that died.
[00:47:32.960 --> 00:47:37.960]   He sees that, so we should thank God for everything that has happened.
[00:47:37.960 --> 00:47:42.960]   But he sees God and says, "He is it.
[00:47:42.960 --> 00:47:44.960]   He is my salvation."
[00:47:44.960 --> 00:47:46.960]   And so he says, "This is my God, I will praise him.
[00:47:46.960 --> 00:47:48.960]   My Father's God, I will extol him.
[00:47:48.960 --> 00:47:50.960]   The Lord is a warrior.
[00:47:50.960 --> 00:47:52.960]   The Lord is his name."
[00:47:52.960 --> 00:47:55.960]   And throughout that, the people are singing and praising.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   His sister is worshiping.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:03.960]   To say that God is my salvation is to say he is my everything.
[00:48:03.960 --> 00:48:05.960]   He surely is my life.
[00:48:05.960 --> 00:48:06.960]   He surely is my security.
[00:48:06.960 --> 00:48:08.960]   He surely is my provision.
[00:48:08.960 --> 00:48:11.960]   He surely is the warrior who's going to protect me.
[00:48:11.960 --> 00:48:17.960]   To say, "This is my God," then he is my everything.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:21.960]   And what he sings is in verse 11, just taking a snidbit.
[00:48:21.960 --> 00:48:26.960]   He says, "Who is like you among the gods, O Lord?
[00:48:26.960 --> 00:48:32.960]   Who is like you, majestic in holiness, awesome in praises and working wonders?
[00:48:32.960 --> 00:48:35.960]   You stretched out your hand and the earth swallowed them.
[00:48:35.960 --> 00:48:39.960]   And in your loving kindness, you have led the people whom you have redeemed.
[00:48:39.960 --> 00:48:44.960]   In your strength, you have guided them to your holy habitation."
[00:48:44.960 --> 00:48:49.960]   So, the truth that I want to highlight is this.
[00:48:49.960 --> 00:48:51.960]   It is a both/and.
[00:48:51.960 --> 00:48:57.960]   Sometimes you will hear kind of cliche-ish advice that in a season like this,
[00:48:57.960 --> 00:49:00.960]   especially when you have so much to do and your life is busy,
[00:49:00.960 --> 00:49:03.960]   maybe things aren't going for you well this day.
[00:49:03.960 --> 00:49:04.960]   Maybe you have family troubles.
[00:49:04.960 --> 00:49:06.960]   Maybe you have business troubles.
[00:49:06.960 --> 00:49:08.960]   Maybe you have all kinds of health issues.
[00:49:08.960 --> 00:49:13.960]   And some people will say to you, "Mark, count your blessings."
[00:49:13.960 --> 00:49:15.960]   Is that good advice?
[00:49:15.960 --> 00:49:17.960]   Yes, it is.
[00:49:17.960 --> 00:49:19.960]   As Christians, you should recount.
[00:49:19.960 --> 00:49:20.960]   You should consider.
[00:49:20.960 --> 00:49:24.960]   You should be able to see the various things God has done in your life.
[00:49:24.960 --> 00:49:28.960]   However, the point is that is not enough, right?
[00:49:28.960 --> 00:49:33.960]   Because from the blessings, you're supposed to see the giver of all the blessings.
[00:49:33.960 --> 00:49:36.960]   And you have heard it said multiple times.
[00:49:36.960 --> 00:49:39.960]   If you've been Christian for any length of time, you have heard this said,
[00:49:39.960 --> 00:49:42.960]   "Do not love just the gifts.
[00:49:42.960 --> 00:49:44.960]   Love the giver."
[00:49:44.960 --> 00:49:45.960]   Yes?
[00:49:45.960 --> 00:49:47.960]   And we're reminded of that today.
[00:49:47.960 --> 00:49:52.960]   Do not love God in such a way where you see God as the cosmic vending machine,
[00:49:52.960 --> 00:49:56.960]   that you see God as the cosmic Amazon Prime.
[00:49:56.960 --> 00:49:58.960]   Next day delivery, you have your stuff.
[00:49:58.960 --> 00:49:59.960]   Yay!
[00:49:59.960 --> 00:50:00.960]   Right?
[00:50:00.960 --> 00:50:11.960]   But rather, give attention to God himself and know that you have not stuff but him.
[00:50:11.960 --> 00:50:12.960]   Okay.
[00:50:12.960 --> 00:50:15.960]   But because you and I have heard that so many times,
[00:50:15.960 --> 00:50:18.960]   I want us to challenge us in a different way.
[00:50:18.960 --> 00:50:23.960]   That that simple truth, "Do we love the giver more than the gifts?"
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:24.960]   It will be tested.
[00:50:24.960 --> 00:50:25.960]   Amen?
[00:50:25.960 --> 00:50:28.960]   It's going to go through testing and fire,
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:31.960]   and God will sometimes do it intentionally.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:35.960]   And here, what I'd like to point to is that God did just that
[00:50:35.960 --> 00:50:38.960]   with these people in the Exodus generation.
[00:50:38.960 --> 00:50:41.960]   What's really interesting is the whole story of the manna.
[00:50:41.960 --> 00:50:44.960]   For that, jump down to Exodus 16.
[00:50:44.960 --> 00:50:48.960]   So we're just walking through Exodus, and we're at Exodus 16,
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:51.960]   and it's crazy because, like I said before,
[00:50:51.960 --> 00:50:56.960]   it hasn't been that long since they just miraculously walked through dry land
[00:50:56.960 --> 00:50:58.960]   with water on their sides.
[00:50:58.960 --> 00:50:59.960]   Take a look.
[00:50:59.960 --> 00:51:02.960]   Exodus 16, verses 1 and on.
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:06.960]   "So they set out from Ilium, and all the congregation of the sons of Israel
[00:51:06.960 --> 00:51:10.960]   came to the wilderness of Sin, which is between Ilium and Sinai,
[00:51:10.960 --> 00:51:15.960]   on the fifteenth day of the second month after their departure from the land of Egypt."
[00:51:15.960 --> 00:51:17.960]   So it's been a month and a half.
[00:51:17.960 --> 00:51:18.960]   Okay?
[00:51:18.960 --> 00:51:19.960]   A month and a half.
[00:51:19.960 --> 00:51:28.960]   Verse 2, "The whole congregation of the sons of Israel"--picture the scene.
[00:51:28.960 --> 00:51:30.960]   It's not just a select few.
[00:51:30.960 --> 00:51:33.960]   It's not, "Ah, you always get those bad apples in the group."
[00:51:33.960 --> 00:51:37.960]   "The whole congregation of the sons of Israel
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:40.960]   grumbled against Moses and Aaron in the wilderness.
[00:51:40.960 --> 00:51:43.960]   And the sons of Israel said to them,
[00:51:43.960 --> 00:51:47.960]   'Would that we have died by the Lord's hand in the land of Egypt
[00:51:47.960 --> 00:51:52.960]   when we sat by the pots of meat and when we ate the bread to the full.
[00:51:52.960 --> 00:51:54.960]   For you have brought us out into this wilderness
[00:51:54.960 --> 00:51:58.960]   to kill us, the whole assembly, with hunger.'"
[00:51:58.960 --> 00:52:00.960]   Wow.
[00:52:00.960 --> 00:52:06.960]   The straight audacity to say, "Maybe God should have just killed us."
[00:52:06.960 --> 00:52:08.960]   What?
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:10.960]   We had meat and food over there.
[00:52:10.960 --> 00:52:12.960]   No, you didn't, you liar.
[00:52:12.960 --> 00:52:14.960]   You're a bunch of slaves.
[00:52:14.960 --> 00:52:16.960]   We're going to die of hunger.
[00:52:16.960 --> 00:52:21.960]   Dude, we're at a juncture in our journey where you could have died every day.
[00:52:21.960 --> 00:52:23.960]   What are you talking about?
[00:52:23.960 --> 00:52:25.960]   You know, that's what I would have said, okay?
[00:52:25.960 --> 00:52:27.960]   Now let's keep reading on.
[00:52:27.960 --> 00:52:31.960]   Verse 4, "Then the Lord said to Moses, 'Behold, I'll rain down thunder.'"
[00:52:31.960 --> 00:52:32.960]   Just kidding.
[00:52:32.960 --> 00:52:36.960]   He says, "I'll rain down bread from heaven for you."
[00:52:36.960 --> 00:52:38.960]   But he could have, right?
[00:52:38.960 --> 00:52:42.960]   I would have rained down burning sulfur.
[00:52:42.960 --> 00:52:45.960]   He says, "No, he rained down sweet bread from heaven,
[00:52:45.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   and the people shall go out and gather a day's portion every day.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:55.960]   Now listen to this, that I may test them, whether or not they will walk in my instruction."
[00:52:55.960 --> 00:52:57.960]   Whoa, pause there.
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:59.960]   Remember my point?
[00:52:59.960 --> 00:53:07.960]   That our true faith that says, "I love God the Giver more than the gifts," will be tested.
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:11.960]   But sometimes it will be tested by your daily bread.
[00:53:11.960 --> 00:53:12.960]   Huh?
[00:53:12.960 --> 00:53:14.960]   And then he says, it goes on here.
[00:53:14.960 --> 00:53:17.960]   Verse 5, "On the sixth day, when they prepare what they bring in,
[00:53:17.960 --> 00:53:20.960]   it will be twice as much as they gather daily.
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:23.960]   So Moses and Aaron said to all the sons of Israel,
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:27.960]   'At evening you will know that the Lord has brought you out of the land of Egypt,
[00:53:27.960 --> 00:53:29.960]   and in the morning you will see the glory of the Lord,
[00:53:29.960 --> 00:53:32.960]   for He hears your grumbling against the Lord.
[00:53:32.960 --> 00:53:35.960]   And what are we that you grumble against us?'"
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:40.960]   So I want you to think and imagine yourself as one of the people, okay?
[00:53:40.960 --> 00:53:45.960]   In my head, when I did that, I was like, "What's wrong with these people?"
[00:53:45.960 --> 00:53:46.960]   That was it.
[00:53:46.960 --> 00:53:48.960]   What's wrong with these people?
[00:53:48.960 --> 00:53:53.960]   In my self-righteousness, I saw myself as much more mature than them.
[00:53:53.960 --> 00:53:54.960]   I wouldn't have complained.
[00:53:54.960 --> 00:53:55.960]   You know why?
[00:53:55.960 --> 00:53:56.960]   I love sweet bread.
[00:53:56.960 --> 00:53:59.960]   Did you know that in another passage, it says that this manna,
[00:53:59.960 --> 00:54:02.960]   they cut an omur and they saved it for the generations.
[00:54:02.960 --> 00:54:05.960]   This manna was like honey bread.
[00:54:05.960 --> 00:54:06.960]   Did you know that?
[00:54:06.960 --> 00:54:10.960]   Just imagine the best piece of bread from '85 or something like that,
[00:54:10.960 --> 00:54:12.960]   and it has goo over it.
[00:54:12.960 --> 00:54:18.960]   It has something like honey, and when the sun got warm, it melted like honey.
[00:54:18.960 --> 00:54:21.960]   Soft, sweet, fluffy bread.
[00:54:21.960 --> 00:54:24.960]   And I'm one of those people that can eat the same thing over and over again.
[00:54:24.960 --> 00:54:25.960]   I have no complaints.
[00:54:25.960 --> 00:54:27.960]   So I'm sitting here like, "What's wrong with you people?"
[00:54:27.960 --> 00:54:31.960]   God could have been like, "As you go, here's this miracle bean.
[00:54:31.960 --> 00:54:33.960]   You plant it and then it grows," right?
[00:54:33.960 --> 00:54:34.960]   But they're nomads.
[00:54:34.960 --> 00:54:35.960]   They couldn't do that.
[00:54:35.960 --> 00:54:36.960]   They didn't sit there and wait for stuff to grow.
[00:54:36.960 --> 00:54:41.960]   So God literally allowed them to move and pick up bread they didn't have to work for.
[00:54:41.960 --> 00:54:44.960]   Why are you complaining?
[00:54:44.960 --> 00:54:48.960]   Seriously, as I was meditating, my voice did the, "Eh," because I was so upset.
[00:54:48.960 --> 00:54:54.960]   Like you have magical miracle bread, true miracle bread.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:58.960]   Did you know that later in Deuteronomy, it describes that if the people were
[00:54:58.960 --> 00:55:03.960]   incapable of collecting enough, the miracle bread would feed the whole family
[00:55:03.960 --> 00:55:04.960]   and they would have plenty.
[00:55:04.960 --> 00:55:08.960]   Did you know that if they accidentally gathered too much, it would go away by the next day?
[00:55:08.960 --> 00:55:12.960]   Did you know that on the sixth day, they would gather double portion and it would last?
[00:55:12.960 --> 00:55:15.960]   But on the other days, it wouldn't last.
[00:55:15.960 --> 00:55:17.960]   But do you know what the people did?
[00:55:17.960 --> 00:55:18.960]   Do you remember?
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.960]   What did they do?
[00:55:21.960 --> 00:55:23.960]   They started getting smart.
[00:55:23.960 --> 00:55:27.960]   And then I realized, "Oh, that's right.
[00:55:27.960 --> 00:55:30.960]   You and I are way too mature to complain about bread."
[00:55:30.960 --> 00:55:34.960]   What they complained about was, "Moses, this is not efficient.
[00:55:34.960 --> 00:55:35.960]   I have a better idea.
[00:55:35.960 --> 00:55:39.960]   Give us bigger baskets and we'll collect for the whole week, then I don't have to go out every day."
[00:55:39.960 --> 00:55:41.960]   I could totally hear myself saying that.
[00:55:41.960 --> 00:55:44.960]   I could hear some of you saying that.
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:48.960]   Or maybe somebody, a bunch of you guys, your parents in here is like,
[00:55:48.960 --> 00:55:51.960]   "Do you have any idea how much my boys eat?"
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:52.960]   I don't know.
[00:55:52.960 --> 00:55:53.960]   I could imagine that.
[00:55:53.960 --> 00:55:57.960]   Once I started sitting there and imagining, dude, they could start complaining nonstop.
[00:55:57.960 --> 00:55:59.960]   Do you know how long they were supposed to eat this bread?
[00:55:59.960 --> 00:56:02.960]   The whole time they were journeying.
[00:56:02.960 --> 00:56:05.960]   So by not being able to plan for the future, what happens?
[00:56:05.960 --> 00:56:08.960]   You can't feel secure.
[00:56:08.960 --> 00:56:11.960]   "Wait a minute, Moses.
[00:56:11.960 --> 00:56:14.960]   I want a big crop of land.
[00:56:14.960 --> 00:56:17.960]   Why are we just eating bread daily?
[00:56:17.960 --> 00:56:23.960]   Why can't we store this up so that we--you know that there's going to be days when we have to run.
[00:56:23.960 --> 00:56:25.960]   You know that there's going to be days maybe people will attack us.
[00:56:25.960 --> 00:56:28.960]   You know that there--"
[00:56:28.960 --> 00:56:34.960]   God took away their security and said, "You get only what you can for the day,
[00:56:34.960 --> 00:56:36.960]   and I'm teaching you to ask and pray.
[00:56:36.960 --> 00:56:40.960]   Give us this day our daily bread."
[00:56:40.960 --> 00:56:45.960]   I began with the question, "How does our faith get tested?
[00:56:45.960 --> 00:56:49.960]   How do we know that God is truly my all in all?"
[00:56:49.960 --> 00:56:54.960]   God then says, "If I am your all in all, let me take away some of the stuff in your life,
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:58.960]   because some of you guys long for friendships.
[00:56:58.960 --> 00:57:03.960]   Some of you guys long for security and just control freaks.
[00:57:03.960 --> 00:57:05.960]   Some of you guys long for ambition.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.960]   I want it to mean something.
[00:57:07.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   I want it to be useful."
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:15.960]   To be a servant of God, God frequently tests you.
[00:57:15.960 --> 00:57:18.960]   First and foremost, "Am I your all in all?"
[00:57:18.960 --> 00:57:21.960]   I pray that we don't have to force it.
[00:57:21.960 --> 00:57:23.960]   This is my prayer.
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:26.960]   "God, you are my all in all.
[00:57:26.960 --> 00:57:28.960]   I don't have to force that out of myself."
[00:57:28.960 --> 00:57:29.960]   Why?
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:31.960]   Look at what you've done.
[00:57:31.960 --> 00:57:32.960]   You've given me hope.
[00:57:32.960 --> 00:57:33.960]   You've given me comfort.
[00:57:33.960 --> 00:57:35.960]   You've given me companionship.
[00:57:35.960 --> 00:57:38.960]   You've given me every single thing I need--loving instruction.
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:40.960]   Some of you guys don't have father figures.
[00:57:40.960 --> 00:57:41.960]   Guess what?
[00:57:41.960 --> 00:57:44.960]   God Almighty is perfect Father.
[00:57:44.960 --> 00:57:45.960]   He'll love you.
[00:57:45.960 --> 00:57:46.960]   He'll discipline you.
[00:57:46.960 --> 00:57:47.960]   He'll instruct you.
[00:57:47.960 --> 00:57:51.960]   He'll give a strong hand, encourage you, and be like, "You can do it, son."
[00:57:51.960 --> 00:57:53.960]   He's everything to you.
[00:57:53.960 --> 00:57:56.960]   Amen?
[00:57:56.960 --> 00:58:01.960]   But in order for us to know that, God will sometimes remove it.
[00:58:01.960 --> 00:58:04.960]   Sometimes I sing these songs.
[00:58:04.960 --> 00:58:07.960]   There are these songs from a long time ago.
[00:58:07.960 --> 00:58:09.960]   Third Day was really big.
[00:58:09.960 --> 00:58:12.960]   The songs were like, "Forsake the world.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:16.960]   Take my life and everything, even if all I have is you."
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:21.960]   And I realize, like, I can't flippantly say that.
[00:58:21.960 --> 00:58:24.960]   Right?
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:28.960]   And then God will test me to see if that's true.
[00:58:28.960 --> 00:58:32.960]   And my prayer for you is to have that thought in your mind.
[00:58:32.960 --> 00:58:38.960]   "Lord, I can be thankful, even when so many things have been taken from me,
[00:58:38.960 --> 00:58:42.960]   because I have you, and I have made you my all in all."
[00:58:42.960 --> 00:58:43.960]   Amen?
[00:58:43.960 --> 00:58:47.960]   And so finally, the way that we have a thanksgiving heart
[00:58:47.960 --> 00:58:53.960]   and a gratitude that lasts and transcends circumstance
[00:58:53.960 --> 00:58:56.960]   is we have eyes of trust.
[00:58:56.960 --> 00:59:02.960]   You have to have eyes of trust that see not according to the flesh.
[00:59:02.960 --> 00:59:03.960]   Why?
[00:59:03.960 --> 00:59:05.960]   Because I'll tell you what.
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:12.960]   If we operate by pragmatics, reason, sensibility, logic,
[00:59:12.960 --> 00:59:17.960]   stuff that comes to us naturally, I just see X and Y, I see A and B,
[00:59:17.960 --> 00:59:23.960]   and my conclusion is C, there's too much stuff to complain about.
[00:59:23.960 --> 00:59:24.960]   Let me say this.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:29.960]   It is difficult to be thankful when you have no food.
[00:59:29.960 --> 00:59:31.960]   So I'm going to be honest.
[00:59:31.960 --> 00:59:34.960]   After meditating, I repented and said, "You know what?
[00:59:34.960 --> 00:59:38.960]   Israelite generation from the Exodus time 3,000 years ago, I'm sorry.
[00:59:38.960 --> 00:59:41.960]   I'm no better than you." Right?
[00:59:41.960 --> 00:59:46.960]   Because I've got to be honest, how many of us are so thankful
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.960]   when we're thirsty and we feel like we're going to die?
[00:59:48.960 --> 00:59:52.960]   How many of us can be so thankful when everything you have
[00:59:52.960 --> 00:59:54.960]   is what's on your back and nothing more?
[00:59:54.960 --> 00:59:55.960]   How many of you can be so thankful?
[00:59:55.960 --> 00:59:56.960]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:59:56.960 --> 00:59:58.960]   And then I think about the pilgrims then.
[00:59:58.960 --> 01:00:00.960]   How could they be so thankful?
[01:00:00.960 --> 01:00:05.960]   Because logically speaking, you should be destitute.
[01:00:05.960 --> 01:00:09.960]   I want you to turn your Bibles to Romans 1,
[01:00:09.960 --> 01:00:14.960]   and I believe that this classic section talking about the sin of man
[01:00:14.960 --> 01:00:17.960]   is talking about something actually quite sensible,
[01:00:17.960 --> 01:00:22.960]   and it's actually also talking about the wilderness generation,
[01:00:22.960 --> 01:00:24.960]   the Exodus people.
[01:00:24.960 --> 01:00:30.960]   Because the whole summary of the Exodus people, a snapshot,
[01:00:30.960 --> 01:00:35.960]   is even though God has given them deliverance, the law,
[01:00:35.960 --> 01:00:37.960]   they have been thankless.
[01:00:37.960 --> 01:00:38.960]   Let me read it to you.
[01:00:38.960 --> 01:00:43.960]   It says in Romans 1:21,
[01:00:43.960 --> 01:00:48.960]   "For even though they knew God, they did not honor him as God or give thanks,
[01:00:48.960 --> 01:00:53.960]   but they became futile in their speculations, and their foolish heart was darkened."
[01:00:53.960 --> 01:00:58.960]   They knew God, but they didn't really know him.
[01:00:58.960 --> 01:01:03.960]   Romans 1:25,
[01:01:03.960 --> 01:01:08.960]   "For they exchanged the truth of God for a lie and worshipped and served the creature
[01:01:08.960 --> 01:01:11.960]   rather than the Creator, who is blessed forever."
[01:01:11.960 --> 01:01:13.960]   What did the wilderness generation do?
[01:01:13.960 --> 01:01:16.960]   They literally saw the hand of God, and then they put up a statue of a cow
[01:01:16.960 --> 01:01:18.960]   and said, "This is your God."
[01:01:18.960 --> 01:01:21.960]   Romans 1:28,
[01:01:21.960 --> 01:01:26.960]   "And just as they did not see fit to acknowledge God any longer,
[01:01:26.960 --> 01:01:30.960]   then God gave them over to a depraved mind."
[01:01:30.960 --> 01:01:34.960]   As soon as they started to lose trust, what did they do?
[01:01:34.960 --> 01:01:37.960]   They started to complain.
[01:01:37.960 --> 01:01:39.960]   This is very indicative of the heart of man.
[01:01:39.960 --> 01:01:43.960]   This is very indicative of somebody who's seized by their flesh.
[01:01:43.960 --> 01:01:46.960]   This is very indicative of somebody who is not really giving trust
[01:01:46.960 --> 01:01:49.960]   to the person and character of God, the individual,
[01:01:49.960 --> 01:01:52.960]   but all they're doing is making practical decisions.
[01:01:52.960 --> 01:01:55.960]   "I'm hungry. He's not for us.
[01:01:55.960 --> 01:01:58.960]   Why do I need to acknowledge this God?"
[01:01:58.960 --> 01:02:02.960]   "You know what's more convenient is to have this God.
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:04.960]   I can carry Him wherever I go."
[01:02:04.960 --> 01:02:07.960]   Literally, the vast majority of the sins of the Israelite people
[01:02:07.960 --> 01:02:09.960]   were sins of convenience.
[01:02:09.960 --> 01:02:13.960]   "I don't want to go all the way to Jerusalem. Let me just worship on this high mountain."
[01:02:13.960 --> 01:02:17.960]   "I don't want to go to a scary God where I have to sacrifice a lamb
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:23.960]   when I can just take a God I can manipulate, control, and take Him in my tent."
[01:02:23.960 --> 01:02:30.960]   The vast majority of their thanklessness came from grumbling.
[01:02:30.960 --> 01:02:33.960]   And in that way, we're no better.
[01:02:33.960 --> 01:02:39.960]   My prayer is that we would mature far past what I just see with my eyes,
[01:02:39.960 --> 01:02:42.960]   far past what I feel as my discomforts,
[01:02:42.960 --> 01:02:47.960]   and to say, "No, no, God, I trust Your character."
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:51.960]   And that's what the nation of Israel did at times when they were sober
[01:02:51.960 --> 01:02:54.960]   and at times when they were delivered and they praised God and said,
[01:02:54.960 --> 01:02:59.960]   "You, You, God, You're powerful, and You're the God of my forefathers,
[01:02:59.960 --> 01:03:02.960]   and You're my God. Amen?
[01:03:02.960 --> 01:03:04.960]   You're everything to me."
[01:03:04.960 --> 01:03:07.960]   That's what we want this season.
[01:03:07.960 --> 01:03:12.960]   Sometimes we being so sophisticated, sometimes we being so efficient,
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:16.960]   sometimes we having thoughts of like, "What may be better for my own life?"
[01:03:16.960 --> 01:03:19.960]   It just gets in the way.
[01:03:19.960 --> 01:03:22.960]   Our Lord is a God who cares for us deeply.
[01:03:22.960 --> 01:03:27.960]   And even when we may question, "Is this the best?"
[01:03:27.960 --> 01:03:29.960]   You know He is working.
[01:03:29.960 --> 01:03:32.960]   You know He is sovereign.
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:39.960]   I want to give to you a passage in Philippians 2, verse 13.
[01:03:39.960 --> 01:03:43.960]   It says, "For it is God who is at work in you,
[01:03:43.960 --> 01:03:46.960]   both to will and to work for His good pleasure."
[01:03:46.960 --> 01:03:48.960]   Do you believe it?
[01:03:48.960 --> 01:03:52.960]   If I sometimes ask people about like, "What is your life's complaint?"
[01:03:52.960 --> 01:03:56.960]   Yeah, some people complain about like, "Oh, my job. It just seems so dead end."
[01:03:56.960 --> 01:03:59.960]   Or maybe some of the biggest complaints are members of our family.
[01:03:59.960 --> 01:04:02.960]   It's like, "Oh, they're so stubborn." You know?
[01:04:02.960 --> 01:04:05.960]   And then I hear a lot these days when I counsel people,
[01:04:05.960 --> 01:04:09.960]   a lot of people are most frustrated with themselves.
[01:04:09.960 --> 01:04:12.960]   "How come I'm not mature enough? And it's scary to think that I'm so weak.
[01:04:12.960 --> 01:04:14.960]   And how come I can't be better?"
[01:04:14.960 --> 01:04:17.960]   And they compare themselves with other people.
[01:04:17.960 --> 01:04:21.960]   If you see with your eyes,
[01:04:21.960 --> 01:04:24.960]   it's like, embrace it. That's you, man.
[01:04:24.960 --> 01:04:27.960]   You're a fallen being who is still in the flesh.
[01:04:27.960 --> 01:04:29.960]   Like, it's only logical, right?
[01:04:29.960 --> 01:04:33.960]   But then if we see with eyes with trust,
[01:04:33.960 --> 01:04:37.960]   God is at work in you to will and to do His good pleasure.
[01:04:37.960 --> 01:04:40.960]   Do you believe it? Do you trust it?
[01:04:40.960 --> 01:04:44.960]   And when we do, verse 14, "Then we can do all things without grumbling or disputing,
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:49.960]   so that we will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent children of God,
[01:04:49.960 --> 01:04:52.960]   above reproach, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
[01:04:52.960 --> 01:04:56.960]   among whom you appear as lights in the world."
[01:04:56.960 --> 01:05:00.960]   So, as we think about this season, honestly speaking, you guys,
[01:05:00.960 --> 01:05:04.960]   we're so incredibly blessed, we should count our blessings.
[01:05:04.960 --> 01:05:07.960]   I mean, I've been on this pulpit before, and I've said,
[01:05:07.960 --> 01:05:11.960]   "I'm probably one of the most blessed pastors that I know of."
[01:05:11.960 --> 01:05:15.960]   And I'm not--that's not like a, "I'm one of the best."
[01:05:15.960 --> 01:05:22.960]   What I mean is, I have people who love me
[01:05:22.960 --> 01:05:26.960]   and walk with me here at this church for 24 years.
[01:05:26.960 --> 01:05:31.960]   I have elders who have given me guidance over all the biggest decisions of my life,
[01:05:31.960 --> 01:05:35.960]   like when I dated or when I messed up, when I was going to school,
[01:05:35.960 --> 01:05:40.960]   when I got married, when I had children, when I got into this position.
[01:05:40.960 --> 01:05:43.960]   I've had an incredibly guarded life.
[01:05:43.960 --> 01:05:45.960]   And then I have you guys.
[01:05:45.960 --> 01:05:48.960]   You guys sit through the sermons, you guys want more teaching,
[01:05:48.960 --> 01:05:51.960]   you guys want counsel, you guys want to grow together.
[01:05:51.960 --> 01:05:54.960]   And sometimes I'm even afraid, because you're so supportive,
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:05:56.960]   of saying things here on the pulpit.
[01:05:56.960 --> 01:05:58.960]   One time I said I love camping.
[01:05:58.960 --> 01:06:02.960]   Next thing I know, all I get is, like, rewards cards to REI.
[01:06:02.960 --> 01:06:05.960]   I'm just being really honest with you.
[01:06:05.960 --> 01:06:09.960]   I'm so grateful, you know what I'm saying?
[01:06:09.960 --> 01:06:15.960]   And then my prayer now is, I pray that my gratefulness would be strong here and now,
[01:06:15.960 --> 01:06:21.960]   but be strong every season, when the Lord tests me.
[01:06:21.960 --> 01:06:23.960]   When the circumstances I can't see with my eyes, like,
[01:06:23.960 --> 01:06:26.960]   "How are we going to do this?"
[01:06:26.960 --> 01:06:28.960]   "How is the Lord going to provide?"
[01:06:28.960 --> 01:06:30.960]   Come on, Mark, as if.
[01:06:30.960 --> 01:06:32.960]   The Lord provided when our church was small.
[01:06:32.960 --> 01:06:34.960]   The Lord provided when we had many pastors.
[01:06:34.960 --> 01:06:36.960]   The Lord provided when our congregation was struggling.
[01:06:36.960 --> 01:06:38.960]   The Lord provided when we hadn't had buildings.
[01:06:38.960 --> 01:06:42.960]   Any circumstance, the Lord has been faithful.
[01:06:42.960 --> 01:06:43.960]   Amen?
[01:06:43.960 --> 01:06:46.960]   Let's pray.
[01:06:46.960 --> 01:06:52.960]   Father, help us to be a mindful people that do not forget you.
[01:06:52.960 --> 01:07:00.960]   Help us, Father God, to not follow in the pattern of our flesh, of our forefathers,
[01:07:00.960 --> 01:07:05.960]   where we can go to a retreat, come back the next day, and forget your name.
[01:07:05.960 --> 01:07:09.960]   I ask, God, that you would help us to remember your goodness,
[01:07:09.960 --> 01:07:13.960]   remember the depth from which you have drawn us out,
[01:07:13.960 --> 01:07:16.960]   the great sin that you have overcome,
[01:07:16.960 --> 01:07:19.960]   and help us to know how good you are.
[01:07:19.960 --> 01:07:23.960]   We thank you today as a congregation joining our voices.
[01:07:23.960 --> 01:07:25.960]   We want to lift you up and exalt you.
[01:07:25.960 --> 01:07:30.960]   It's in Christ's name. Amen.
[01:07:30.960 --> 01:07:51.960]   Let's all rise for the closing praise.
[01:07:51.960 --> 01:08:02.960]   [music]
[01:08:02.960 --> 01:08:09.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:08:09.960 --> 01:08:15.960]   No one could take your place.
[01:08:15.960 --> 01:08:22.960]   My heart beats to worship you.
[01:08:22.960 --> 01:08:28.960]   I live just to see your face.
[01:08:28.960 --> 01:08:35.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:08:35.960 --> 01:08:42.960]   No one could take your place.
[01:08:42.960 --> 01:08:49.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:08:49.960 --> 01:08:54.960]   No one like you.
[01:08:54.960 --> 01:08:56.960]   You are.
[01:08:56.960 --> 01:09:02.960]   You are my God.
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:09.960]   You're everything to me.
[01:09:09.960 --> 01:09:16.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:09:16.960 --> 01:09:23.960]   No one like you.
[01:09:23.960 --> 01:09:29.960]   You are my God.
[01:09:29.960 --> 01:09:36.960]   You're everything to me.
[01:09:36.960 --> 01:09:43.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:09:43.960 --> 01:09:49.960]   No one like you.
[01:09:49.960 --> 01:09:56.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:09:56.960 --> 01:10:02.960]   No one could take your place.
[01:10:02.960 --> 01:10:09.960]   I long for your presence, Lord.
[01:10:09.960 --> 01:10:15.960]   To serve you is my reward.
[01:10:15.960 --> 01:10:22.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:10:22.960 --> 01:10:29.960]   No one could take your place.
[01:10:29.960 --> 01:10:36.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:10:36.960 --> 01:10:42.960]   No one like you.
[01:10:42.960 --> 01:10:49.960]   You are my God.
[01:10:49.960 --> 01:10:56.960]   You're everything to me.
[01:10:56.960 --> 01:11:02.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:09.960]   No one like you.
[01:11:09.960 --> 01:11:15.960]   You are my God.
[01:11:15.960 --> 01:11:22.960]   You're everything to me.
[01:11:22.960 --> 01:11:29.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:11:29.960 --> 01:11:33.960]   No one like you.
[01:11:33.960 --> 01:11:36.960]   Sing, you are my God.
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:42.960]   You are my God.
[01:11:42.960 --> 01:11:49.960]   You're everything to me.
[01:11:49.960 --> 01:11:56.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:11:56.960 --> 01:12:03.960]   No one like you.
[01:12:03.960 --> 01:12:09.960]   You are my God.
[01:12:09.960 --> 01:12:16.960]   You're everything to me.
[01:12:16.960 --> 01:12:23.960]   There's no one like you, my Lord.
[01:12:23.960 --> 01:12:28.960]   No one like you.
[01:12:28.960 --> 01:12:37.960]   All right, God, we do thank you again from our hearts, Lord.
[01:12:37.960 --> 01:12:42.960]   We bless you for the mercies anew every single day.
[01:12:42.960 --> 01:12:47.960]   We bless you, God, for granting to us life, our breath, and our daily bread.
[01:12:47.960 --> 01:12:53.960]   And then most of all, Father, thank you that we are known by you and that we can know you.
[01:12:53.960 --> 01:12:58.960]   I ask, God, that you would continue to grow our faith, grow our hearts,
[01:12:58.960 --> 01:13:03.960]   so that truly as we walk through this life, even if the people threaten us,
[01:13:03.960 --> 01:13:10.960]   even if we lose here and there, even if everything we treasure and value get taken away,
[01:13:10.960 --> 01:13:13.960]   we have full security with you, God.
[01:13:13.960 --> 01:13:15.960]   We have everything in you, Lord.
[01:13:15.960 --> 01:13:16.960]   So we thank you this day.
[01:13:16.960 --> 01:13:17.960]   It's in Christ's name.
[01:13:17.960 --> 01:13:19.960]   Amen.
[01:13:20.960 --> 01:13:26.960]   God sent his Son.
[01:13:26.960 --> 01:13:31.960]   They called him Jesus.
[01:13:31.960 --> 01:13:37.960]   He came to earth.
[01:13:37.960 --> 01:13:43.960]   He lived and died.
[01:13:43.960 --> 01:13:54.960]   He lived and died to abide by Father.
[01:13:54.960 --> 01:14:05.960]   An empty grave is there to hold my Savior in.
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:16.960]   Because he lives, I can face tomorrow.
[01:14:16.960 --> 01:14:27.960]   Because he lives, all fear is gone.
[01:14:27.960 --> 01:14:37.960]   Because I know he holds the future.
[01:14:37.960 --> 01:14:48.960]   And life is worth the living just because he lives.
[01:14:49.960 --> 01:14:53.960]   Alleluia.
