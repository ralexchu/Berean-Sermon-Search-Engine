[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Hebrews 9.11-14.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Hebrews 9.11-14.
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:25.640]   Reading out of the NASB, "But when Christ appeared as a high priest to the good things
[00:00:25.640 --> 00:00:30.240]   to come, He entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle, not made with hands,
[00:00:30.240 --> 00:00:32.840]   that is to say, not of this creation.
[00:00:32.840 --> 00:00:36.800]   And not through the blood of goats and calves, but through His own blood He entered the holy
[00:00:36.800 --> 00:00:40.460]   place once for all, having obtained eternal redemption.
[00:00:40.460 --> 00:00:44.440]   For if the blood of goats and bulls and the ashes of a high fir sprinkling those who have
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:48.880]   been defiled sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh, how much more will the blood of
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:53.240]   Christ, who through the eternal Spirit offered Himself without blemish to God, cleanse your
[00:00:53.240 --> 00:00:55.840]   conscience from dead works to serve the living God."
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:59.160]   Let's pray.
[00:00:59.160 --> 00:01:03.140]   Christian loving Father, we pray that Your Word would go forth, will not return until
[00:01:03.140 --> 00:01:06.960]   You have accomplished what You have ordained for it.
[00:01:06.960 --> 00:01:12.360]   I pray that You would soften our hearts, open our ears, Lord God, that we may hear from
[00:01:12.360 --> 00:01:14.420]   You and You alone.
[00:01:14.420 --> 00:01:19.540]   May Your Word have its impact that You've desired from us and let it be ordained according
[00:01:19.540 --> 00:01:20.540]   to Your Spirit.
[00:01:20.540 --> 00:01:21.540]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:21.540 --> 00:01:22.540]   Amen.
[00:01:22.540 --> 00:01:28.720]   If you've been watching the news at all, and I highly encourage you to follow the international
[00:01:28.720 --> 00:01:32.680]   news and what's going on with especially in the Christian community.
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:38.580]   I think in the last two to three years, the uptick in persecution, whether it is in the
[00:01:38.580 --> 00:01:43.520]   Middle East or India or China, I think most people who've been paying attention, have
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:49.280]   been Christian for a while, will agree that persecution has been increasing exponentially
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.620]   everywhere.
[00:01:50.620 --> 00:01:54.820]   But this is not just what's going on internationally, it's happening locally.
[00:01:54.820 --> 00:02:02.420]   And so all the more we need to be paying attention, because there's going to come a time, if not
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:07.620]   pretty soon, where nominal Christianity is not going to be an option.
[00:02:07.620 --> 00:02:13.580]   Just like in China now, they made an official edict that in the churches they have to hang
[00:02:13.580 --> 00:02:20.080]   a picture of Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping, and to acknowledge them as their ultimate authority
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:25.740]   or else they're not going to get social help from the government.
[00:02:25.740 --> 00:02:29.620]   And so they made that clear, and again the persecution has been increasing there, but
[00:02:29.620 --> 00:02:34.520]   more and more we see signs of that beginning to happen in the United States.
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:40.540]   So this casual church attendance, I think at some point, is going to go out the door.
[00:02:40.540 --> 00:02:45.340]   People who just grew up in the church and happen to go to church will be forced to make
[00:02:45.340 --> 00:02:47.820]   a decision where you stand.
[00:02:47.820 --> 00:02:52.800]   And nominal Christianity will not, I think, when persecution comes, is not going to be
[00:02:52.800 --> 00:02:55.160]   an option.
[00:02:55.160 --> 00:03:01.800]   One of the benefits of persecution causes Christians, whether nominal or true, to ask
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:04.960]   the question, "Where do I stand with Christ?"
[00:03:04.960 --> 00:03:07.800]   It causes us to count the cost.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:12.680]   Again, you and I live in a generation where the churches have worked extra hard to make
[00:03:12.680 --> 00:03:17.760]   it as easy as possible for as many people to come to church.
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:21.560]   And as a result of that, the gospel has been watered down.
[00:03:21.560 --> 00:03:25.240]   Anything offensive, anything that doesn't sit right, anything that goes against our
[00:03:25.240 --> 00:03:30.040]   culture has been, the sharp edges have been taken out.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:35.680]   So we have masses of people who are attending churches and have never really asked the question,
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:38.880]   "Do I really believe this?"
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:44.400]   And when the Bible tells us to count the cost, we have churches filled with people who have
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:47.480]   never seriously considered that.
[00:03:47.480 --> 00:03:53.480]   And so the benefit of persecution, persecution forces us to take a step back and take a hard
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.240]   look at what it is that we believe, what are the consequences of our belief, and causes
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.640]   us to make a stand.
[00:04:00.640 --> 00:04:04.520]   Do I believe this or do I not believe this?
[00:04:04.520 --> 00:04:08.920]   The reason why I say all of this is because the book of Hebrews is written in that same
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:09.920]   spirit.
[00:04:09.920 --> 00:04:15.400]   The first generation of Christians, they didn't know what Christianity was and all they knew
[00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:20.040]   was there's something new swept the land and all of a sudden there's this hope of eternal
[00:04:20.040 --> 00:04:24.700]   life and if you believe in Jesus Christ, you're going to have eternity secure.
[00:04:24.700 --> 00:04:28.400]   So there was some pushback from the secular world, there was some pushback from the Jewish
[00:04:28.400 --> 00:04:33.940]   community, but for the most part, it was just something new and novel.
[00:04:33.940 --> 00:04:40.360]   And so this church that the author is writing to, initially was excited.
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.680]   Initially they participated in this growth, but now about 20 to 30 years removed from
[00:04:45.680 --> 00:04:52.440]   that, Nero's persecution most likely is in full swing and some of the leaders are being
[00:04:52.440 --> 00:04:54.240]   beheaded, crucified.
[00:04:54.240 --> 00:04:59.480]   People are being dragged into the Colosseum and in the midst of that, some of them were
[00:04:59.480 --> 00:05:03.160]   beginning to slide back into their old life.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:06.840]   Now they didn't outright deny Christ.
[00:05:06.840 --> 00:05:09.400]   They didn't say, "You know, we don't believe this."
[00:05:09.400 --> 00:05:13.840]   They were trying to synchrotize their past with the new things that they were learning.
[00:05:13.840 --> 00:05:19.680]   And so the whole point of what he says about Jesus being superior to angels, to Moses,
[00:05:19.680 --> 00:05:23.960]   to the sacrificial system, he's the greatest high priest, he has better sacrifice, better
[00:05:23.960 --> 00:05:31.800]   tabernacle, all of it is to really ask the question, "Are you going to follow Christ?
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:34.860]   Are you going to drift back into the world?"
[00:05:34.860 --> 00:05:38.900]   The text that we're looking at, even though it is not stated in the form of a question,
[00:05:38.900 --> 00:05:40.340]   but that's actually what he's doing.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:41.800]   He's asking the question.
[00:05:41.800 --> 00:05:47.160]   Now that there are serious consequences for being a Christian, is Jesus better than whatever
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:50.720]   it is that you are placing your hope in?
[00:05:50.720 --> 00:05:55.040]   So there's three things that I want to highlight in what he says today.
[00:05:55.040 --> 00:05:59.800]   Verses 11 and 12, he's really asking that question in a statement form.
[00:05:59.800 --> 00:06:03.880]   He's asking the question, "Is Jesus better than anything that you have?"
[00:06:03.880 --> 00:06:09.380]   Number two, Jesus is better because he delivers us from empty works, from dead works.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.820]   Verses 13 and 14.
[00:06:10.820 --> 00:06:14.800]   And then verse 14, Jesus frees us to serve the living God.
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:17.500]   Those are the three things that we want to be looking at this morning.
[00:06:17.500 --> 00:06:22.880]   So the first thing that he says in verse 11 and 12, that Jesus is better high priest.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:27.540]   He's the better sacrifice in a better tabernacle.
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:31.180]   Now we didn't practice the tabernacle.
[00:06:31.180 --> 00:06:34.840]   We're not from the Jewish community, so we may look at that and say, "Well, that's good
[00:06:34.840 --> 00:06:40.220]   to know, but I don't know if there's any practical application here because we never struggled
[00:06:40.220 --> 00:06:44.540]   with the tabernacle being better."
[00:06:44.540 --> 00:06:49.140]   But if you understand why the tabernacle was created in the beginning, the whole purpose
[00:06:49.140 --> 00:06:53.940]   of the tabernacle and the sacrificial system was to do two things.
[00:06:53.940 --> 00:06:57.480]   Is to reveal man's sin.
[00:06:57.480 --> 00:07:02.860]   So that we would know that God is holy and that we would know how sinful we are.
[00:07:02.860 --> 00:07:06.220]   So that sin would become utterly sinful.
[00:07:06.220 --> 00:07:11.940]   And then two, to point to the only solution to our sins is the atonement of Jesus Christ.
[00:07:11.940 --> 00:07:14.700]   So it was created for those two reasons.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:20.560]   To teach us who we are and who God is, and then to give us a solution in Jesus Christ.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:27.100]   But by the time that this is being written, the tabernacle became nothing more than religion.
[00:07:27.100 --> 00:07:31.700]   Now at the core of every community, if you go back and if you travel anywhere in the
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:38.500]   world, if you go back 30, 40, 50 years, and it may be in some cultures even to this day,
[00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:41.100]   you'll see what religion means to most people.
[00:07:41.100 --> 00:07:45.700]   I remember the first time I went to China, I think it was in 1991.
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.420]   Oh, was it '93, I think, right?
[00:07:49.420 --> 00:07:55.480]   I went and we were traveling the Silk Road for about 30 days and almost every single
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:57.820]   day we were in a new city.
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:03.780]   We were on a train to go to the western side, to the southern side, the northern side, and
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:10.580]   outside of the major cities like Beijing or to Shanghai, we would go to these obscure
[00:08:10.580 --> 00:08:13.360]   cities that usually tourists don't go to.
[00:08:13.360 --> 00:08:19.220]   And every city that we went to, we would eventually end up at some Buddhist temple.
[00:08:19.220 --> 00:08:22.940]   And by the time we were about 15 days into it, I was so sick of it.
[00:08:22.940 --> 00:08:28.260]   We would travel miles and sometimes we would be on a train for 20, 30 hours and we'd get
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:35.580]   to the end and we'd walk up this hill and it said, "This is called 100 Buddha Temple."
[00:08:35.580 --> 00:08:37.500]   And exactly what it is.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:40.540]   They have 100 Buddha in this temple.
[00:08:40.540 --> 00:08:41.900]   And I said, "Oh, great."
[00:08:41.900 --> 00:08:45.500]   And then we would go to another train and we'd get to the other side of China and then
[00:08:45.500 --> 00:08:47.980]   we'd walk and get up to the top of the hill.
[00:08:47.980 --> 00:08:54.300]   This is called a 1000 Buddha Mountain because they carved a 1000 Buddhas up on this mountain.
[00:08:54.300 --> 00:08:58.140]   Then we go to another city and we hike up to the highest hill and we get up way up in
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.160]   the top, two, three hours of hiking.
[00:09:00.160 --> 00:09:03.940]   This is called the Buddha's Highest Heaven Temple.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.180]   So about 15 days of this, I got so sick of this.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.380]   And I started to think, "Why was this so important?"
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:16.140]   Like everything that they did centered around Buddha because it was a Buddhist culture.
[00:09:16.140 --> 00:09:25.420]   If you traveled in any amount, most cultures, if you go back in history, whether it is a
[00:09:25.420 --> 00:09:32.660]   Buddhist culture, whether it is an Islamic culture, whether it is a Hindu culture, religion
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:35.560]   is not just a part of their life.
[00:09:35.560 --> 00:09:37.380]   It affects their diet.
[00:09:37.380 --> 00:09:43.420]   It affects what they wear, where they live, what they hope for, everything that they do.
[00:09:43.420 --> 00:09:49.740]   And at the core of religion is if we appease this God, we can get his blessing so that
[00:09:49.740 --> 00:09:55.340]   our farm will grow, we would have more children, that we would be healthy, wealthy, and that
[00:09:55.340 --> 00:09:58.220]   we could progress and we can get ahead in life.
[00:09:58.220 --> 00:10:06.140]   So no matter what religion it is, it was their avenue to be successful in this world.
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:12.260]   Now whether that's Buddha or Islam or whatever religion, at the base of it is, if your goodness
[00:10:12.260 --> 00:10:17.300]   outweighs your badness, you're going to get good things.
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:24.160]   By the time of Christ, the temple and the tabernacle became nothing more than an avenue
[00:10:24.160 --> 00:10:28.920]   for them to tap into this God so that they can have God's blessing.
[00:10:28.920 --> 00:10:33.340]   So when they were saying "Shalom" to one another, "Peace," they were saying, "Well, if we obeyed
[00:10:33.340 --> 00:10:38.320]   the law and if we went to the temple and gave enough sacrifice, and if our goodness outweigh
[00:10:38.320 --> 00:10:43.460]   the badness, that God is going to bless us."
[00:10:43.460 --> 00:10:46.340]   They completely missed the mark.
[00:10:46.340 --> 00:10:51.500]   Now we can hear now, you know, say, "You know, we don't live in a necessarily a religious
[00:10:51.500 --> 00:10:52.500]   culture."
[00:10:52.500 --> 00:10:57.660]   You know, at best we live in a post-Christian culture.
[00:10:57.660 --> 00:11:00.780]   But it's not a religious culture, it's a secular culture.
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:06.300]   But in a secular culture, our avenue to get what we want has changed.
[00:11:06.300 --> 00:11:12.220]   We may not go to Buddha and light incense, or we may not be Hindus, but the avenue in
[00:11:12.220 --> 00:11:13.700]   which to get there is no different.
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:16.700]   A lot of people come to church for the same reason.
[00:11:16.700 --> 00:11:23.020]   That if I do enough right things, that maybe God will bless my business, my life, my children.
[00:11:23.020 --> 00:11:27.660]   Or we may think that maybe if we get the right president, maybe if we change the culture,
[00:11:27.660 --> 00:11:32.520]   maybe if we change this and change that, my life would be better.
[00:11:32.520 --> 00:11:38.940]   So we may not have physical idols, but whatever it is that we are pursuing, that through that
[00:11:38.940 --> 00:11:41.580]   somehow we're going to get a better life.
[00:11:41.580 --> 00:11:46.980]   We may not have a specific name for that, other than secularism or materialism, the
[00:11:46.980 --> 00:11:51.860]   idol is still the same, because the idol is worshipped for the purpose of getting something
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.820]   good out of it.
[00:11:53.820 --> 00:11:58.180]   See, the tabernacle became nothing more than religion to these Jews.
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:02.940]   And so they were beginning to drift back because now it seemed like if they continued to follow
[00:12:02.940 --> 00:12:07.140]   Christ, they would actually forfeit something meaningful.
[00:12:07.140 --> 00:12:08.180]   Maybe even their life.
[00:12:08.180 --> 00:12:11.660]   And as a result of that, they were kind of drifting back and they weren't denying Christ.
[00:12:11.660 --> 00:12:13.580]   They were trying to combine the two.
[00:12:13.580 --> 00:12:18.420]   Maybe a part of Judaism where they came from, and then to retain some of the gospel that
[00:12:18.420 --> 00:12:19.420]   they had.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:23.880]   And it is in the middle of that, and this is the reason why he keeps saying over and
[00:12:23.880 --> 00:12:26.740]   over again, "Jesus is better than the angels.
[00:12:26.740 --> 00:12:28.020]   Jesus is better than Moses.
[00:12:28.020 --> 00:12:29.620]   Jesus is better than the high priest.
[00:12:29.620 --> 00:12:31.060]   He's better than the tabernacle."
[00:12:31.060 --> 00:12:36.020]   And at the end of the day, he's asking the same question over and over and over and over
[00:12:36.020 --> 00:12:38.260]   again.
[00:12:38.260 --> 00:12:42.660]   Is Jesus better than your pursuit?
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:45.440]   Is Jesus better than your comfort?
[00:12:45.440 --> 00:12:49.020]   Is Jesus better than whatever it is that brings joy in your life?
[00:12:49.020 --> 00:12:50.940]   Is Jesus better than your family?
[00:12:50.940 --> 00:12:52.680]   Is Jesus better than your children?
[00:12:52.680 --> 00:12:55.100]   Is Jesus better?
[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:00.620]   Because anything that we place between us and God is an idol.
[00:13:00.620 --> 00:13:05.580]   And that's why he says, "Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come."
[00:13:05.580 --> 00:13:10.020]   He doesn't promise that if you follow Christ, that if you sacrifice now, if you do good
[00:13:10.020 --> 00:13:14.020]   things now, great things are going to happen to your children.
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:18.300]   That if you come to church and serve and give enough, that if you started a business, that
[00:13:18.300 --> 00:13:20.100]   it's going to take off.
[00:13:20.100 --> 00:13:23.860]   That whatever struggles that you have, if you appease this holy God, that you're going
[00:13:23.860 --> 00:13:27.300]   to have a better education, find a better job, find a better husband, find a better
[00:13:27.300 --> 00:13:28.860]   wife.
[00:13:28.860 --> 00:13:30.460]   It doesn't promise that.
[00:13:30.460 --> 00:13:37.500]   In fact, some of the most godliest people live miserable lives following Christ.
[00:13:37.500 --> 00:13:43.540]   You may be the most faithful Christian and get cancer and die the next day because our
[00:13:43.540 --> 00:13:46.660]   long life is not promised in Christ.
[00:13:46.660 --> 00:13:51.540]   You can pursue God, be the most faithful Christian, give the most, serve the most, sacrifice the
[00:13:51.540 --> 00:13:57.100]   most, and in the eyes of the world, live a tragic life and die.
[00:13:57.100 --> 00:13:58.100]   Because it is not promised.
[00:13:58.100 --> 00:14:02.100]   He said, "Christ appeared as a high priest of the good things to come."
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:06.300]   And the good things he's talking about is not necessarily this life.
[00:14:06.300 --> 00:14:09.580]   They're godly people who are beheaded because they follow Christ.
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:12.980]   Apostle Paul was an aristocrat.
[00:14:12.980 --> 00:14:16.300]   He was actually famous before he met Christ.
[00:14:16.300 --> 00:14:19.780]   And as a result of following Christ, he became a tent maker.
[00:14:19.780 --> 00:14:26.660]   Every city that he went, he was driven out, went to prison, then ultimately beheaded.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:29.820]   His life was miserable because he followed Christ.
[00:14:29.820 --> 00:14:32.980]   Now then, why would anybody follow Christ?
[00:14:32.980 --> 00:14:39.260]   If a good life here is not promised in the Gospel, why would anybody follow Christ?
[00:14:39.260 --> 00:14:45.260]   Only people who would genuinely follow the Christ of the Bible is a person who believes
[00:14:45.260 --> 00:14:47.680]   that good things are coming.
[00:14:47.680 --> 00:14:49.720]   That is not here.
[00:14:49.720 --> 00:14:53.620]   If the payoff is here, then it's nothing more than religion.
[00:14:53.620 --> 00:14:55.420]   Nothing more than how the Jews view the tabernacle.
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:59.940]   It is nothing more than the Buddhists who are building 100 temples because the more
[00:14:59.940 --> 00:15:05.020]   that they go there, they're going to get blessing from God.
[00:15:05.020 --> 00:15:10.020]   You may call him Jesus, but Jesus has become another idol to get what we want.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:16.380]   And it is in that context, he says he entered through the greater and more perfect tabernacle,
[00:15:16.380 --> 00:15:19.440]   not to reconcile us here but in heaven.
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.240]   He entered the holy place once for all and obtained eternal redemption.
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.220]   He says this term over and over again, once for all.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:30.380]   He died for us once for all.
[00:15:30.380 --> 00:15:31.440]   It's final, it's complete.
[00:15:31.440 --> 00:15:34.280]   Why does he emphasize that?
[00:15:34.280 --> 00:15:41.460]   Because our temptation to continue to drift back into our idols is constant.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.340]   You may commit one day and then be tempted the next day.
[00:15:45.340 --> 00:15:50.160]   And we are constantly in need or wanting and tempted and coveting something else.
[00:15:50.160 --> 00:15:55.460]   And that's why every time we hear about Jesus's atonement, it emphasizes it is done once for
[00:15:55.460 --> 00:15:56.460]   all.
[00:15:56.460 --> 00:15:59.420]   It is not through Jesus you are looking for something else.
[00:15:59.420 --> 00:16:02.340]   Jesus is not strengthening us so that we can get something else.
[00:16:02.340 --> 00:16:05.460]   But when you have come to Christ, you have come to the end of the road.
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:07.700]   There's nothing more to seek.
[00:16:07.700 --> 00:16:11.700]   That's why he says once for all permanently.
[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:16.820]   You know, years ago, I think it's been about 12 years, we were doing our membership class
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.300]   or our BCC class.
[00:16:19.300 --> 00:16:24.020]   And we had a Hindu lady who came to church and started attending this class.
[00:16:24.020 --> 00:16:28.900]   And we teach doctrines about God, Christ, Holy Spirit, about the inerrancy of scripture.
[00:16:28.900 --> 00:16:32.340]   And so we're going through these doctrines and she sat through all of it.
[00:16:32.340 --> 00:16:36.420]   And then, you know, we were hearing that she wanted to become a member.
[00:16:36.420 --> 00:16:40.560]   So we got excited, you know, that a Hindu lady was committed Hindu all her life and
[00:16:40.560 --> 00:16:43.500]   all of a sudden she wants to give her life to Christ.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.900]   And so we were trying to interview and talk to her.
[00:16:47.900 --> 00:16:52.580]   And in the process of talking to her, we realized that she wasn't converting at all.
[00:16:52.580 --> 00:16:55.380]   You know, so initially we asked this, oh, so you want to follow Jesus Christ?
[00:16:55.380 --> 00:16:56.380]   And she says, yes.
[00:16:56.380 --> 00:16:58.420]   Oh, so you're going to denounce your Hindu faith?
[00:16:58.420 --> 00:17:00.500]   She said, no.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:01.700]   And so we're confused.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:02.700]   What does that mean?
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:08.580]   I said, well, you know, I, you know, like it's very intriguing and all I like Christians.
[00:17:08.580 --> 00:17:12.560]   Christians are very friendly, you know, and then when I come to church and everybody's
[00:17:12.560 --> 00:17:14.540]   so happy and so I want to be a part of that.
[00:17:14.540 --> 00:17:16.920]   So I wanted Jesus too.
[00:17:16.920 --> 00:17:24.120]   So in her mind, she was basically adding Christ to all the other idols so that she can have
[00:17:24.120 --> 00:17:28.760]   all the other things that all the other idols promise and then to have what the Christians
[00:17:28.760 --> 00:17:31.520]   have by following Jesus.
[00:17:31.520 --> 00:17:39.400]   So all she did was add Christ to the idols that she was already following.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:44.600]   Sad to say Christianity looks very similar to that in many circles, in many Christians.
[00:17:44.600 --> 00:17:48.200]   They've never left their old life.
[00:17:48.200 --> 00:17:50.760]   They've never abandoned their idols.
[00:17:50.760 --> 00:17:53.000]   All they've done is added Christ.
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:56.240]   That maybe if I add Christ, you know, all these other things that I can do to live a
[00:17:56.240 --> 00:17:57.240]   better life.
[00:17:57.240 --> 00:18:01.140]   And then I want assurance that if I die, I'm not going to hell.
[00:18:01.140 --> 00:18:06.600]   And it's nothing more than adding Christ as an idol to the existing idols they follow.
[00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:14.680]   And again, it is in this where he says over and over and over again, is Christ better?
[00:18:14.680 --> 00:18:16.080]   Is he better than what you pursue?
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.640]   Is he better than your comfort?
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.840]   Is he better than whatever it is that you're shooting for or hoping for?
[00:18:21.840 --> 00:18:28.700]   If your life turns miserable and you have Christ, will it be enough?
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:32.040]   Whatever it is that you're pursuing, you don't get it.
[00:18:32.040 --> 00:18:40.040]   And at the end of your life, you live a difficult, hard life, and yet you have Christ.
[00:18:40.040 --> 00:18:42.760]   Is that enough?
[00:18:42.760 --> 00:18:45.280]   I know this is something that we ask up in the pulpit.
[00:18:45.280 --> 00:18:47.880]   Pastors ask this up in the pulpit.
[00:18:47.880 --> 00:18:53.400]   Is this something that you only hear up in the pulpit once a week or at Bible study?
[00:18:53.400 --> 00:18:58.500]   Or is this something that you ask yourself in your daily life?
[00:18:58.500 --> 00:18:59.500]   What you are pursuing?
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:03.140]   Do you ask yourself, am I genuinely following Christ?
[00:19:03.140 --> 00:19:06.460]   Is he enough?
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:13.180]   Because he who drinks of the water that the world gives, he says he will thirst again.
[00:19:13.180 --> 00:19:19.020]   If you eat of the bread that this world gives, you will hunger again.
[00:19:19.020 --> 00:19:24.020]   He who drinks of the water and eats of the bread that only Christ can give, he will no
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:27.260]   longer thirst and he will no longer hunger.
[00:19:27.260 --> 00:19:30.300]   Do you believe that?
[00:19:30.300 --> 00:19:34.100]   He may not phrase it in those words, but basically that's what he's saying repeatedly over and
[00:19:34.100 --> 00:19:39.780]   over in every single chapter, at every conclusion, of every Christology that he's stating in
[00:19:39.780 --> 00:19:43.460]   the book of Hebrews, he's asking the same question.
[00:19:43.460 --> 00:19:46.300]   Is Jesus better?
[00:19:46.300 --> 00:19:48.620]   He's not asking, is Jesus good?
[00:19:48.620 --> 00:19:51.620]   They all would have said, Jesus is good.
[00:19:51.620 --> 00:19:54.460]   He's asking, is Jesus better?
[00:19:54.460 --> 00:19:58.020]   Is he the best?
[00:19:58.020 --> 00:20:00.020]   That's the first thing that he says, right?
[00:20:00.020 --> 00:20:06.800]   At the end and conclusion, which is a question that every Christian needs to be able to answer.
[00:20:06.800 --> 00:20:13.580]   Because especially now, if we're not anchored in Christ, the tides are pushing us away.
[00:20:13.580 --> 00:20:16.940]   And if we're drifting or we're just thinking like we're just going to casually just kind
[00:20:16.940 --> 00:20:23.500]   of sit on our boat, the tide is violently taking us away from Christ.
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:28.220]   We need to anchor in Christ and to be able to answer this question with an emphatic yes.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:32.780]   When persecution comes, it's not here yet.
[00:20:32.780 --> 00:20:37.620]   People snickering and not liking you, that's not persecution.
[00:20:37.620 --> 00:20:39.900]   Those are signs of it coming.
[00:20:39.900 --> 00:20:46.220]   When persecution comes, if you are not anchored, you will not stay in place.
[00:20:46.220 --> 00:20:51.980]   Secondly, he is better because he delivers us from dead works.
[00:20:51.980 --> 00:20:56.380]   In verse 13, it says, "For if the blood of goats and bulls and ashes of high for sprinkling
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:00.500]   those who have been defiled, sanctify for the cleansing of the flesh."
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:02.620]   In other words, it has some value.
[00:21:02.620 --> 00:21:08.380]   What they were doing had some value because it allowed them to enter into the tabernacle.
[00:21:08.380 --> 00:21:12.500]   And they were able to come and give sacrifices because they cleansed themselves and went
[00:21:12.500 --> 00:21:13.980]   through this ritual.
[00:21:13.980 --> 00:21:19.180]   But outside of that, he says, it does nothing.
[00:21:19.180 --> 00:21:25.140]   Because the whole point of the tabernacle was to demonstrate to them that they are not
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:27.500]   able.
[00:21:27.500 --> 00:21:32.780]   In Hebrews chapter 6, 1-2, he says, "Therefore, leaving the elementary teachings about Christ,
[00:21:32.780 --> 00:21:39.620]   let us press on to maturity, not laying again the foundation of repentance from dead works.
[00:21:39.620 --> 00:21:43.380]   And the faith toward God, of instruction about washing and laying down of hands and the resurrection
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.620]   of the dead, and eternal judgment."
[00:21:45.620 --> 00:21:53.420]   In other words, this religious activity of thinking that if we serve enough, if we give
[00:21:53.420 --> 00:21:58.940]   enough, if we sacrifice enough, is that all of these things of the old covenant, it's
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:21:59.940]   dead.
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:02.460]   It's no longer useful.
[00:22:02.460 --> 00:22:06.580]   Just like if you've been driving a car, you know, if you drove it for 10 years, I mean,
[00:22:06.580 --> 00:22:07.980]   you milk that car, right?
[00:22:07.980 --> 00:22:09.540]   And then you want to buy a new car.
[00:22:09.540 --> 00:22:15.220]   Nobody buys, you know, pays money to buy a car that has 400,000 miles on it.
[00:22:15.220 --> 00:22:16.220]   Maybe some of you do, right?
[00:22:16.220 --> 00:22:20.700]   But if you say, if you have 400,000 miles on it, it's like, wow!
[00:22:20.700 --> 00:22:22.700]   You know, that thing went a long time.
[00:22:22.700 --> 00:22:26.420]   You don't expect it to go to another 400,000 miles, right?
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:31.060]   I know somebody after service is going to come up and say, oh, I have a car that's 500,000
[00:22:31.060 --> 00:22:32.060]   miles.
[00:22:32.060 --> 00:22:34.020]   You know what I'm saying, okay?
[00:22:34.020 --> 00:22:37.940]   You don't buy because you know it's about to die.
[00:22:37.940 --> 00:22:43.060]   So what he's saying is the tabernacle was given in order to show who God is and ultimately
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:44.060]   point to Christ.
[00:22:44.060 --> 00:22:47.380]   But now that Christ is here, it is useless.
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:51.400]   That all that you were doing in the tabernacle, it is passed away.
[00:22:51.400 --> 00:22:52.580]   It has no function anymore.
[00:22:52.580 --> 00:22:54.020]   That's why the temple was destroyed.
[00:22:54.020 --> 00:22:58.740]   God allowed it to be destroyed because it had no use for it anymore.
[00:22:58.740 --> 00:23:07.140]   And in the same way, now that Christ has come and has redeemed us, he says the dead works
[00:23:07.140 --> 00:23:08.140]   are behind us.
[00:23:08.140 --> 00:23:10.780]   Now, we can say, you know, I've never been to the tabernacle.
[00:23:10.780 --> 00:23:15.380]   I've never given sacrifices, so this is not relevant to me.
[00:23:15.380 --> 00:23:22.640]   At the core of who we are, at the core of who we are, because we are born in this world,
[00:23:22.640 --> 00:23:29.600]   we have a works-based righteousness embedded deeply inside of us.
[00:23:29.600 --> 00:23:35.660]   Because ever since you are born, you are taught to be independent.
[00:23:35.660 --> 00:23:39.740]   So if you have a child and you're raising it, we have markers, right?
[00:23:39.740 --> 00:23:44.820]   By the time they're one, those of you who raise children, by the time they're one, what
[00:23:44.820 --> 00:23:48.860]   are they supposed to do?
[00:23:48.860 --> 00:23:52.140]   You guys remember?
[00:23:52.140 --> 00:23:55.220]   Usually around one is when the kids start walking.
[00:23:55.220 --> 00:23:56.620]   So parents get nervous.
[00:23:56.620 --> 00:24:00.300]   Some kids walk at 10 months, some kids walk a little bit later than that, but around one,
[00:24:00.300 --> 00:24:02.180]   they say, oh, that's when they start walking.
[00:24:02.180 --> 00:24:07.020]   And by the time they're about two is when they're starting to formulate words.
[00:24:07.020 --> 00:24:10.820]   They'll put two words, three words together, or some of them are a little bit faster, some
[00:24:10.820 --> 00:24:14.220]   of them are a little bit slower, but there's these markers.
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.500]   They get to a certain point, they start wiping their own butt.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:20.200]   I mean, that's a huge help to the parents.
[00:24:20.200 --> 00:24:25.580]   They get a little bit behind that and they start tying their own shoes.
[00:24:25.580 --> 00:24:28.060]   They come and they compare your kids to the other kids.
[00:24:28.060 --> 00:24:29.780]   Oh, my kid's tying their own shoes.
[00:24:29.780 --> 00:24:32.500]   Well, my kid brushed their own teeth.
[00:24:32.500 --> 00:24:35.460]   Because there's these markers of maturity.
[00:24:35.460 --> 00:24:38.780]   After a certain point, they wake up and they pour their own cereal and then they can make
[00:24:38.780 --> 00:24:42.700]   their own breakfast and then they go start taking their own showers.
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:46.660]   Then after that, they get their own car.
[00:24:46.660 --> 00:24:50.140]   You know, they become independent, walk to school by themselves, or come back and forth.
[00:24:50.140 --> 00:24:55.380]   And then eventually they become mature enough, independent enough where they get a job, they
[00:24:55.380 --> 00:24:56.920]   move out and make their own life.
[00:24:56.920 --> 00:25:02.860]   And so we have these maturing marks where because they've worked hard, because they
[00:25:02.860 --> 00:25:07.260]   put in the work in from the parents and the kids, they become more independent.
[00:25:07.260 --> 00:25:11.220]   They learn to live on their own.
[00:25:11.220 --> 00:25:13.940]   Because that's how we function.
[00:25:13.940 --> 00:25:23.680]   And at the core of who we are, works-based righteousness or reward makes sense.
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:29.700]   So imagine if you weren't a Christian and you heard for the first time, here's this
[00:25:29.700 --> 00:25:34.900]   criminal who lived all his life selling drugs and doing no good things.
[00:25:34.900 --> 00:25:38.140]   And he went to prison and he met Christ.
[00:25:38.140 --> 00:25:41.600]   So he comes out and he's going to go to heaven for eternity.
[00:25:41.600 --> 00:25:47.880]   And here's this person who paid his taxes, was a good citizen, was kind to his neighbors,
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:54.700]   and was generous, a good citizen, and because he didn't believe in Jesus Christ, he's going
[00:25:54.700 --> 00:25:57.960]   to go to hell for eternity.
[00:25:57.960 --> 00:26:01.040]   Who would think that that's fair?
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:03.240]   Who would follow Christ?
[00:26:03.240 --> 00:26:04.480]   Because that makes no sense.
[00:26:04.480 --> 00:26:09.340]   Because everything inside of us says that's wrong.
[00:26:09.340 --> 00:26:17.100]   The guy who worked his tail off, he should get the greater reward, not that guy.
[00:26:17.100 --> 00:26:19.380]   Every single one of us.
[00:26:19.380 --> 00:26:21.080]   That's embedded inside.
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:25.360]   Even as I shared that illustration to you, my guess is most of you are agreeing with
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:26.360]   me.
[00:26:26.360 --> 00:26:28.720]   That doesn't make any sense.
[00:26:28.720 --> 00:26:31.560]   And yet you and I don't think much about it.
[00:26:31.560 --> 00:26:32.760]   We sing about it.
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.240]   We memorize scripture.
[00:26:34.240 --> 00:26:41.800]   We tell other people about it, not realizing what that sounds like to non-Christians.
[00:26:41.800 --> 00:26:51.560]   Unless, unless you realize that we are all dead in our trespasses.
[00:26:51.560 --> 00:26:55.600]   That this was not a race between the fast and the slow.
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:27:00.120]   That some people worked hard, got faster, some people who didn't work as hard, didn't
[00:27:00.120 --> 00:27:01.420]   make it.
[00:27:01.420 --> 00:27:05.020]   The Bible says we are dead in our trespasses.
[00:27:05.020 --> 00:27:12.260]   And that was the whole purpose of the law, is to tell us that there is no hope.
[00:27:12.260 --> 00:27:17.420]   Whether you are rich or whether you are moral and you lived all your life to be a good person
[00:27:17.420 --> 00:27:21.060]   versus somebody who lived all his life to do no good.
[00:27:21.060 --> 00:27:25.680]   That in the presence of a holy God, there is no hope.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:28.120]   That no one can access this holy God.
[00:27:28.120 --> 00:27:35.000]   And that was the purpose of the law, to break, to break this concept of, if I'm good enough,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:39.480]   if I work hard enough, that somehow I can appease this holy God.
[00:27:39.480 --> 00:27:43.120]   It was to make sin utterly sinful.
[00:27:43.120 --> 00:27:50.040]   And that's why religion is a shaking of fists toward this holy God and saying, "I will.
[00:27:50.040 --> 00:27:53.120]   I'm going to bridge this gap by my work.
[00:27:53.120 --> 00:27:54.600]   By working harder.
[00:27:54.600 --> 00:27:56.160]   I've achieved everything else.
[00:27:56.160 --> 00:27:57.760]   I was successful in business.
[00:27:57.760 --> 00:28:00.040]   I was successful in school.
[00:28:00.040 --> 00:28:01.920]   I raised up good children.
[00:28:01.920 --> 00:28:04.400]   I can do this too."
[00:28:04.400 --> 00:28:10.240]   A religious philosophy, a religious living is nothing more than shaking his fist at a
[00:28:10.240 --> 00:28:13.800]   holy God and saying, "I'm going to bridge this gap."
[00:28:13.800 --> 00:28:20.240]   See the whole purpose of the law came to tell us that we are dead in our trespasses.
[00:28:20.240 --> 00:28:27.120]   In Romans 3, 19-20, it says, "Now we know that whatever the law says, it speaks to those
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:32.040]   who are under the law, so that every mouth may be closed."
[00:28:32.040 --> 00:28:34.360]   You know what that means in modern English?
[00:28:34.360 --> 00:28:40.200]   The purpose of the law came to basically to shut us up.
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.120]   That we would all be humbled.
[00:28:42.120 --> 00:28:48.280]   Whether you are Nicodemus or whether you are the Samaritan woman, all have sinned and fall
[00:28:48.280 --> 00:28:50.320]   short of the glory of God.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.000]   That we are all humbled before this holy God.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:55.560]   There's no one who can stand before a holy God.
[00:28:55.560 --> 00:29:01.280]   No sinner can ever stand before a holy God and demand justice.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:08.760]   Because justice requires condemnation for eternity, even to the most moralist of person.
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.880]   And that's what he means.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.560]   That he delivered us from these dead works.
[00:29:13.560 --> 00:29:18.440]   It is useless in bridging this gap between us and God.
[00:29:18.440 --> 00:29:22.280]   And all the world may become accountable to God because by the works of the law, no flesh
[00:29:22.280 --> 00:29:24.600]   will be justified in his sight.
[00:29:24.600 --> 00:29:28.520]   For through the law comes the knowledge of sin.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:34.880]   See, pride in the gospel is a contradiction.
[00:29:34.880 --> 00:29:40.960]   Any Christian man who becomes more and more proud because of his learning, because of
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:46.680]   his experience, because of his fruit, has completely missed the mark.
[00:29:46.680 --> 00:29:51.420]   The more mature we become, the more humble we become.
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:55.960]   Because the more we recognize the distance between us and him without Christ.
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:00.040]   Galatians 2.16, "Nevertheless, knowing that a man is not justified by the works of the
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:04.000]   law, but through faith in Christ Jesus.
[00:30:04.000 --> 00:30:07.720]   Even we have believed in Christ Jesus so that we may be justified by the faith in Christ
[00:30:07.720 --> 00:30:14.560]   and not by the works of the law, since by the works of the law no flesh will be justified."
[00:30:14.560 --> 00:30:20.120]   You see, when we repent, when we repent, we're not coming to God and saying, "I'm sorry,
[00:30:20.120 --> 00:30:22.520]   I'll do better."
[00:30:22.520 --> 00:30:23.520]   That's not repentance.
[00:30:23.520 --> 00:30:27.280]   In fact, that's arrogance.
[00:30:27.280 --> 00:30:31.640]   Repentance is coming before God and saying, "I am unable."
[00:30:31.640 --> 00:30:33.920]   It's not, "I will try harder.
[00:30:33.920 --> 00:30:34.920]   You know, I screwed up.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:38.840]   Give me another chance so that I'll do it again."
[00:30:38.840 --> 00:30:44.320]   True repentance is recognizing that we are unable and surrendering to this God.
[00:30:44.320 --> 00:30:49.960]   See, the blood of Christ frees us from dead works.
[00:30:49.960 --> 00:30:56.720]   Until a man rests in Christ, he will never be able to labor in Christ.
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:31:03.760]   Because human experience by his own works, like Solomon says in Ecclesiastes, "It's nothing
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:04.760]   new under the sun.
[00:31:04.760 --> 00:31:05.920]   It's all vanity.
[00:31:05.920 --> 00:31:08.520]   All our hard work is vanity.
[00:31:08.520 --> 00:31:10.880]   All this time raising godly children, vanity."
[00:31:10.880 --> 00:31:14.280]   Or whatever it is that we have hoped for.
[00:31:14.280 --> 00:31:16.520]   If we work hard enough, we'll raise good children.
[00:31:16.520 --> 00:31:18.200]   They're going to have good jobs.
[00:31:18.200 --> 00:31:20.720]   Get married to a godly woman, godly husband.
[00:31:20.720 --> 00:31:26.040]   Settle down and be able to live a nice, comfortable life according to Solomon, according to the
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:28.240]   wisdom of the world, according to the gospel.
[00:31:28.240 --> 00:31:30.880]   It's all vanity.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:33.040]   All of it is.
[00:31:33.040 --> 00:31:34.240]   Nothing new under the sun.
[00:31:34.240 --> 00:31:39.360]   Ecclesiastes 2, 22-23, "For what does a man get in all his labor and in his striving with
[00:31:39.360 --> 00:31:41.060]   which he labors under the sun?
[00:31:41.060 --> 00:31:46.080]   Because all his days, his task is painful and grievous.
[00:31:46.080 --> 00:31:48.400]   Even at night his mind does not rest.
[00:31:48.400 --> 00:31:52.160]   This too is vanity."
[00:31:52.160 --> 00:31:59.240]   Until every human being, every person in this room learns to find rest in the atonement
[00:31:59.240 --> 00:32:04.160]   of Christ, we become useless in the kingdom of God.
[00:32:04.160 --> 00:32:07.200]   Because we rely on our own works.
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:11.040]   We become proud when we're doing good.
[00:32:11.040 --> 00:32:15.360]   And then when we're not doing well, we have low self-esteem.
[00:32:15.360 --> 00:32:16.360]   I can't serve God.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:18.840]   I can't do this.
[00:32:18.840 --> 00:32:26.460]   So either pride or self-loathing is a result of a righteousness based on our work.
[00:32:26.460 --> 00:32:29.200]   So he says, he frees us.
[00:32:29.200 --> 00:32:34.480]   The atonement of Christ frees us from the bondage of dead works.
[00:32:34.480 --> 00:32:40.000]   And only an individual who has been freed from the bondage of dead works can be useful,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:43.240]   number three, to serve the living God.
[00:32:43.240 --> 00:32:45.120]   To serve the living God.
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:46.720]   To truly serve the living God.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:32:50.640]   The word for serve here is the same word that he uses in verse one.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:56.440]   Now even the first covenant had regulations of divine worship and the earthly sanctuary.
[00:32:56.440 --> 00:33:00.920]   But in this passage in verse 14, the same word, same root word is used to describe to
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.480]   serve, "lechu'o."
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:05.620]   And that's what that word means.
[00:33:05.620 --> 00:33:11.200]   The word proskuneo means a position of surrender.
[00:33:11.200 --> 00:33:12.700]   Is to bow down.
[00:33:12.700 --> 00:33:16.720]   And that's the word that is used most prominently in the New Testament.
[00:33:16.720 --> 00:33:22.840]   But this word lechu'o is describing a physical action.
[00:33:22.840 --> 00:33:26.240]   In this context, talking about the tabernacle, the priests are going and giving sacrifices
[00:33:26.240 --> 00:33:29.540]   and everything that they were doing, it was an act of worship.
[00:33:29.540 --> 00:33:34.620]   So to apply that to today, when he says that only a man who has been freed from his dead
[00:33:34.620 --> 00:33:41.900]   works, that he is free to serve the living God, to worship the living God.
[00:33:41.900 --> 00:33:46.780]   Worship is not simply what happens in this room from 1030 to 12.
[00:33:46.780 --> 00:33:48.620]   Because we showed up.
[00:33:48.620 --> 00:33:55.480]   By nature of the word worship, it means to love something, to adore something, to find
[00:33:55.480 --> 00:33:56.820]   enjoyment in something.
[00:33:56.820 --> 00:34:03.340]   Just like if you get too carried away with sports, your friends will say, "Man, you worship
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:05.020]   the Lakers."
[00:34:05.020 --> 00:34:07.320]   Or "You worship the Dodgers."
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:13.260]   Or maybe you fell in love with your girlfriend or husband or wife or whatever and you just
[00:34:13.260 --> 00:34:15.140]   like all you're thinking about is this person.
[00:34:15.140 --> 00:34:17.140]   It's like, "Man, you worship her."
[00:34:17.140 --> 00:34:19.520]   What do we mean by that?
[00:34:19.520 --> 00:34:26.340]   It means that you find so much joy in this, that's all you think about.
[00:34:26.340 --> 00:34:33.700]   Some people get so carried away and just love Lakers to the point where they know where
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:36.120]   these basketballs are made.
[00:34:36.120 --> 00:34:42.580]   If I asked you how much the Spalding basketball weighs, I bet you some of you guys know.
[00:34:42.580 --> 00:34:45.620]   I bet you you know where the leather is made.
[00:34:45.620 --> 00:34:49.100]   It used to be made in this country, but because of the weather condition and the political
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:53.560]   climate, the leather was cheaper out in China and then the political situation, so they
[00:34:53.560 --> 00:34:54.560]   moved to Vietnam.
[00:34:54.560 --> 00:34:57.800]   Starting from next year, they're going to bring another ball, but the weight is too
[00:34:57.800 --> 00:34:59.980]   high so they're going to deflate it.
[00:34:59.980 --> 00:35:03.900]   And then next year, the eastern side is going to use this basketball, but the western side
[00:35:03.900 --> 00:35:05.480]   is going to use that basketball.
[00:35:05.480 --> 00:35:08.280]   But after two months, they're going to try it out and they're going to see what's going
[00:35:08.280 --> 00:35:09.280]   to happen.
[00:35:09.280 --> 00:35:10.280]   You know all about that.
[00:35:10.280 --> 00:35:13.340]   Absolutely useless information.
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.340]   You don't get anything out of that.
[00:35:14.340 --> 00:35:17.720]   No one's paying you to do that, but because you love it that much.
[00:35:17.720 --> 00:35:20.000]   That's what we mean by worship.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:21.460]   That you adore it so much.
[00:35:21.460 --> 00:35:27.720]   You get so much enjoyment out of it that you give yourself fully to that.
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.520]   That's the nature of the word worship.
[00:35:31.520 --> 00:35:36.640]   So when the Bible tells us to worship God in spirit and in truth, He's not simply talking
[00:35:36.640 --> 00:35:44.000]   about going through the regulation of coming to church and singing songs and giving and
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:45.640]   becoming a member.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:52.740]   He's talking about seeing God's glory and becoming a worshiper of God.
[00:35:52.740 --> 00:35:57.560]   That we become obsessed with Him because there's nothing better than Him.
[00:35:57.560 --> 00:35:59.000]   And so that's why we worship.
[00:35:59.000 --> 00:36:00.960]   Remember when we first became Christians?
[00:36:00.960 --> 00:36:05.800]   I remember when I first became a Christian, asking the Bible study leader if I can come
[00:36:05.800 --> 00:36:07.560]   to Friday Bible study.
[00:36:07.560 --> 00:36:12.440]   I was living in Burbank in the middle of baseball tryouts and I spent eight months preparing
[00:36:12.440 --> 00:36:19.160]   for this baseball tryout and I became a Christian in the middle of winter break and I just lost
[00:36:19.160 --> 00:36:20.160]   interest.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:21.760]   I just wanted to be at this Bible study.
[00:36:21.760 --> 00:36:25.520]   And as a young believer, I didn't know that you were allowed to come to Bible study.
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:28.080]   I thought it was for the elite.
[00:36:28.080 --> 00:36:29.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:29.080 --> 00:36:31.400]   I asked, "Can I?
[00:36:31.400 --> 00:36:33.040]   Is it possible?"
[00:36:33.040 --> 00:36:36.480]   So not only do they want me to come, they said, "I'll pick you up."
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:41.680]   So I had one of the Bible study leaders come from LA and pick me up in Burbank every Friday
[00:36:41.680 --> 00:36:44.120]   for a year and a half.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:50.260]   But I remember thinking, "Wow, this is so awesome."
[00:36:50.260 --> 00:36:55.440]   And they had a prayer meeting at 10 o'clock and I was like, "Can I come to this prayer
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:57.440]   meeting just for the leadership?"
[00:36:57.440 --> 00:37:00.160]   They said, "Yeah, of course."
[00:37:00.160 --> 00:37:03.760]   Let me stay sometimes two, three in the morning.
[00:37:03.760 --> 00:37:06.360]   And then we would just sleep at the church, wake up the next day and they would take me
[00:37:06.360 --> 00:37:07.360]   back home.
[00:37:07.360 --> 00:37:09.920]   I don't know if my parents were worried or not.
[00:37:09.920 --> 00:37:10.920]   They never asked.
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.640]   So just stayed Saturday.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:13.640]   We would spend all day.
[00:37:13.640 --> 00:37:15.360]   And it's not just me.
[00:37:15.360 --> 00:37:17.060]   I know other believers.
[00:37:17.060 --> 00:37:22.440]   When they first become a Christian and first become a worshiper of Christ, they're like,
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:24.000]   "Oh, can I sit up in the front?"
[00:37:24.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   I said, "Yes."
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:27.200]   I'm trying to get people to sit more in the front.
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:29.120]   You know what I mean?
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:30.120]   Can I do this?
[00:37:30.120 --> 00:37:33.600]   And I've had people ask me, "Can I dress this way?
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:36.440]   What kind of Bible do I need to get?
[00:37:36.440 --> 00:37:39.440]   Can I serve?"
[00:37:39.440 --> 00:37:42.200]   We have two groups of people at churches.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:47.800]   Usually you have a group of people who are eager to serve and it's like, "Oh, can I serve?
[00:37:47.800 --> 00:37:48.800]   Where can I serve?"
[00:37:48.800 --> 00:37:54.120]   And then you have the other half that's like, "Do I have to serve?
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:56.040]   Is this mandatory?
[00:37:56.040 --> 00:37:57.600]   Can I have to be there?"
[00:37:57.600 --> 00:38:02.380]   That's the difference between worshiping and religion.
[00:38:02.380 --> 00:38:05.800]   People who are going through the motion and checking off the things that you're supposed
[00:38:05.800 --> 00:38:12.600]   to do versus somebody who's seen the glory of Christ and fell in love.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:17.840]   That's why he describes the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your
[00:38:17.840 --> 00:38:20.000]   heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:28.840]   Is to restore the worship that we lost because we've fallen from his glory.
[00:38:28.840 --> 00:38:31.760]   So we were not able to see his beauty.
[00:38:31.760 --> 00:38:34.020]   So that's what the cross did.
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:40.560]   It showed us the beauty of the God that created us so that we may come back to worship him,
[00:38:40.560 --> 00:38:44.960]   adore him because that's where we find life.
[00:38:44.960 --> 00:38:47.360]   And that's why we study Leviticus.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:48.360]   That's why we come to church.
[00:38:48.360 --> 00:38:50.200]   That's why we serve.
[00:38:50.200 --> 00:38:53.440]   That's why even in this hot weather we come.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:57.420]   Because I find greater life here than anywhere else.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:59.000]   That's what he means.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:04.640]   That when we recognize who he is, that he's better than anything else that we can possibly
[00:39:04.640 --> 00:39:12.200]   pursue in this world, and he delivers us from the dead works that continue to bind us, then
[00:39:12.200 --> 00:39:17.900]   he frees us so that we can serve and worship this living God.
[00:39:17.900 --> 00:39:21.200]   That's the whole point of what he's trying to get.
[00:39:21.200 --> 00:39:24.920]   He's not telling people who are drifting, he's like, "Hey, you better come back."
[00:39:24.920 --> 00:39:31.280]   He said, "Do you not recognize what you are drifting from?
[00:39:31.280 --> 00:39:38.800]   You're drifting from where the greatest joy and greatest life is found."
[00:39:38.800 --> 00:39:46.400]   I pray that, especially now, again, you and I live in a generation where Christianity,
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:50.480]   the name Christian, has lost its meaning.
[00:39:50.480 --> 00:39:53.400]   Because the gospel has been watered down so much.
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.400]   We've been worried so much about losing numbers in the church that we've just, as long as
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:03.440]   the church is full, we're doing great.
[00:40:03.440 --> 00:40:05.960]   That's not what God is looking for.
[00:40:05.960 --> 00:40:11.120]   He said he's looking for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:40:11.120 --> 00:40:16.960]   The greatest witness that you and I can be in this world is to love God with all your
[00:40:16.960 --> 00:40:19.600]   heart, mind, and soul, and strength.
[00:40:19.600 --> 00:40:24.520]   And this world that doesn't know God will look at your life and say, "What is it about
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:28.720]   Jesus that you would worship him like that?
[00:40:28.720 --> 00:40:30.840]   Why would you sit in the hot sun?
[00:40:30.840 --> 00:40:34.200]   Why would you risk your health?"
[00:40:34.200 --> 00:40:38.720]   Then we can say it's because of what Christ has done.
[00:40:38.720 --> 00:40:47.240]   So my prayer is, especially now, as the turmoil and the tide violently is pushing our culture
[00:40:47.240 --> 00:40:54.520]   away from Christ, that we absolutely must be anchored in Christ.
[00:40:54.520 --> 00:41:01.360]   That we ask ourselves, not just this morning, not just today, but ask ourselves, "Is Christ
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:03.720]   enough?"
[00:41:03.720 --> 00:41:10.120]   And if he is not, there's nothing else more important than to deal with that question.
[00:41:10.120 --> 00:41:15.400]   Let's pray.
[00:41:15.400 --> 00:41:23.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your kindness, your goodness, your mercy.
[00:41:23.400 --> 00:41:30.440]   I pray, Father God, that as you open our eyes to see the glory of Jesus Christ, the glory
[00:41:30.440 --> 00:41:35.200]   of who you are, that cause us to be born again.
[00:41:35.200 --> 00:41:40.640]   If we've drifted from that and been tempted and coveting things, Lord God, that are worthless,
[00:41:40.640 --> 00:41:45.440]   help us, Lord God, to be re-anchored in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:50.420]   Help us to be a witness in this dark world that we may be the light.
[00:41:50.420 --> 00:41:55.320]   Help us to have opportunities, Lord God, to be able to share the gospel, to be ready in
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:41:59.560]   season and out of season to preach your word.
[00:41:59.560 --> 00:42:04.680]   Help us, Lord God, as a church to stimulate, to provoke one another on toward loving good
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:13.760]   deeds that in our community that Christ may be exalted, that joy and worship may flourish,
[00:42:13.760 --> 00:42:17.680]   that the world may know that we worship the living God.
[00:42:17.680 --> 00:42:19.240]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
