[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:04.060]   There's no sin that can be justified before you.
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:07.060]   God, that you sent your son to die for our sins.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.060]   God, that we may be justified

[00:15:17.060 --> 00:15:20.060]   that all our hearts would reflect upon this.

[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.060]   So thank you, in Jesus name I pray, amen.

[00:25:12.900 --> 00:25:15.900]   - I love you, oh Lord, my strength.
[00:25:15.900 --> 00:25:21.900]   The Lord is my rock and my fortress and my deliverer,
[00:25:21.900 --> 00:25:26.900]   my God, my rock in whom I take refuge,
[00:25:26.900 --> 00:25:31.900]   my shield and the horn of my salvation,
[00:25:31.900 --> 00:25:32.900]   my stronghold.
[00:25:32.900 --> 00:25:38.900]   I call upon the Lord who is worthy to be praised
[00:25:38.900 --> 00:25:40.900]   and I am saved from my enemies.
[00:25:41.900 --> 00:25:42.900]   Join me in prayer.
[00:25:42.900 --> 00:25:51.900]   Father, we are gathered here tonight wanting to
[00:25:51.900 --> 00:25:57.900]   just worship, wanting to bless your heart.
[00:25:57.900 --> 00:26:03.900]   And Father, undoubtedly, just we are all coming in here
[00:26:03.900 --> 00:26:08.900]   with different emotions and with different things
[00:26:08.900 --> 00:26:10.900]   that are on our minds and our hearts.
[00:26:11.900 --> 00:26:15.900]   But we wanna gather tonight really to understand your heart
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.900]   and to just grow, to commune and fellowship with you
[00:26:19.900 --> 00:26:23.900]   first and foremost, and in turn, just be more effective
[00:26:23.900 --> 00:26:25.900]   in loving those around us.
[00:26:25.900 --> 00:26:28.900]   Help us to pray tonight.
[00:26:28.900 --> 00:26:32.900]   Lord, we are willing, we are eager,
[00:26:32.900 --> 00:26:35.900]   so would you lead our time that we have together
[00:26:35.900 --> 00:26:36.900]   in Jesus name we pray.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:40.900]   So every day in our family,
[00:26:40.900 --> 00:26:45.900]   we say I love you to each other often.
[00:26:45.900 --> 00:26:49.900]   To my kids, I say that almost as like a kind of a goodbye.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:50.900]   I love you, bye.
[00:26:50.900 --> 00:26:53.900]   And just even to my wife, like in the morning
[00:26:53.900 --> 00:26:55.900]   when she goes off to work and things like that.
[00:26:55.900 --> 00:26:58.900]   And it is not that we don't mean it,
[00:26:58.900 --> 00:27:01.900]   but sometimes those words are said out of habit.
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:06.900]   And sometimes it's said simply to like reassure our kids
[00:27:06.900 --> 00:27:11.900]   or my wife that, you know, just I'm committed to you.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:16.900]   But we say it often, regularly,
[00:27:16.900 --> 00:27:20.900]   and special occasions roll around.
[00:27:20.900 --> 00:27:22.900]   And we just passed Valentine's Day,
[00:27:22.900 --> 00:27:24.900]   I wrote my wife a card.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:28.900]   And I don't start out with I love you,
[00:27:28.900 --> 00:27:31.900]   it starts with something like a happy Valentine's Day,
[00:27:31.900 --> 00:27:34.900]   this is our what, like eight, 19th Valentine's Day together
[00:27:34.900 --> 00:27:36.900]   and something mushy.
[00:27:36.900 --> 00:27:39.900]   And with on this special occasion,
[00:27:39.900 --> 00:27:43.900]   I don't want to say things that I don't mean.
[00:27:43.900 --> 00:27:44.900]   It is a card.
[00:27:44.900 --> 00:27:49.900]   And what's interesting is as I am penning
[00:27:49.900 --> 00:27:53.900]   the different qualities of our life together
[00:27:53.900 --> 00:27:54.900]   that I've grown to appreciate,
[00:27:54.900 --> 00:27:56.900]   the different aspects of my wife
[00:27:56.900 --> 00:27:59.900]   that I've grown to admire and enjoy,
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:02.900]   and all the trials and the ups and downs
[00:28:02.900 --> 00:28:05.900]   that we've gone through that I get to kind of reflect on
[00:28:05.900 --> 00:28:08.900]   as I'm writing, by the time I get to
[00:28:08.900 --> 00:28:12.900]   the closing I love you,
[00:28:12.900 --> 00:28:14.900]   it's interesting what happens to my heart.
[00:28:14.900 --> 00:28:15.900]   It changes.
[00:28:15.900 --> 00:28:20.900]   And it's not that I didn't mean it before,
[00:28:20.900 --> 00:28:25.900]   but I think the content of that phrase,
[00:28:25.900 --> 00:28:29.900]   just there's a little extra depth there.
[00:28:30.900 --> 00:28:35.900]   And I share that because Psalm 18
[00:28:35.900 --> 00:28:37.900]   is written kind of like that.
[00:28:37.900 --> 00:28:43.900]   Just there's an I love you, oh Lord, my strength.
[00:28:43.900 --> 00:28:47.900]   And it's a longer Psalm.
[00:28:47.900 --> 00:28:49.900]   And it goes into all the details
[00:28:49.900 --> 00:28:54.900]   of why David is praising and extolling
[00:28:54.900 --> 00:28:56.900]   and loving the God of his strength.
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:01.900]   And Psalm 18 was written after the Lord
[00:29:01.900 --> 00:29:03.900]   delivered David out of the hands of his enemies
[00:29:03.900 --> 00:29:05.900]   and especially out of the hands of Saul.
[00:29:05.900 --> 00:29:08.900]   And Psalm 18 is full of praise to God
[00:29:08.900 --> 00:29:10.900]   and specific praise to God.
[00:29:10.900 --> 00:29:14.900]   And I'd like to imagine David is thinking like,
[00:29:14.900 --> 00:29:17.900]   who am I to be loved by God?
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:23.900]   I was the youngest brother just tending the sheep,
[00:29:23.900 --> 00:29:25.900]   minding my own business,
[00:29:25.900 --> 00:29:29.900]   and of all the people in this great nation of Israel,
[00:29:29.900 --> 00:29:31.900]   he chooses me to lead.
[00:29:31.900 --> 00:29:34.900]   And who am I to represent him
[00:29:34.900 --> 00:29:36.900]   before this giant in front of this army?
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:42.900]   Who am I to just lead these people?
[00:29:42.900 --> 00:29:47.900]   And for some reason, God's given me great success.
[00:29:47.900 --> 00:29:51.900]   And yet, even in the trial of having to deal
[00:29:51.900 --> 00:29:53.900]   with my adversary, King Saul,
[00:29:54.900 --> 00:29:57.900]   who I have respect for,
[00:29:57.900 --> 00:29:59.900]   but he keeps coming after me.
[00:29:59.900 --> 00:30:02.900]   And I don't need to defend myself against him
[00:30:02.900 --> 00:30:05.900]   because God is taking care of that.
[00:30:05.900 --> 00:30:07.900]   Who am I?
[00:30:07.900 --> 00:30:11.900]   And it's almost like just a knee-jerk reaction,
[00:30:11.900 --> 00:30:13.900]   explosion in prayer and praise,
[00:30:13.900 --> 00:30:19.900]   and it starts with, I love you, O Lord, my strength.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:22.900]   And we're fickle.
[00:30:22.900 --> 00:30:25.900]   We're easily distracted.
[00:30:25.900 --> 00:30:28.900]   And when we say, I love God,
[00:30:28.900 --> 00:30:33.900]   it's not that we're not sincere about that,
[00:30:33.900 --> 00:30:34.900]   and it's not that we don't mean it
[00:30:34.900 --> 00:30:37.900]   when we just say it, even in casual passing.
[00:30:37.900 --> 00:30:40.900]   But sometimes it helps to reflect
[00:30:40.900 --> 00:30:45.900]   on just the things that he's been faithful to me in,
[00:30:45.900 --> 00:30:47.900]   recently,
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:50.900]   the things that he's been so kind to me in
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:52.900]   over the last seasons of my life,
[00:30:52.900 --> 00:30:55.900]   and in the totality of my life,
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:30:58.900]   to pluck me out of despair and to save my soul.
[00:30:58.900 --> 00:31:00.900]   He is so good.
[00:31:00.900 --> 00:31:04.900]   And so we want to start tonight by just reflecting.
[00:31:04.900 --> 00:31:07.900]   And the first thing I want you guys to pray over,
[00:31:07.900 --> 00:31:09.900]   if I can have the next slide,
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:15.900]   is to just confess that the Lord is the refuge
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.900]   to whom we turn in times of trouble.
[00:31:19.900 --> 00:31:22.900]   And to say, God, there's nothing good
[00:31:22.900 --> 00:31:24.900]   in me outside of Christ.
[00:31:24.900 --> 00:31:30.900]   There's no person, no institution I can trust outside of you.
[00:31:30.900 --> 00:31:33.900]   And I cling myself, and I cleave to you tonight.
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.900]   Remind me afresh of who it is that I'm praying to.
[00:31:37.900 --> 00:31:41.900]   So confess that the Lord is a refuge to whom we turn.
[00:31:41.900 --> 00:31:44.900]   The second thing in your time of prayer,
[00:31:44.900 --> 00:31:48.900]   I would like you to praise God for his great salvation.
[00:31:49.900 --> 00:31:53.900]   And if that's become something that you share and say,
[00:31:53.900 --> 00:31:57.900]   and it doesn't just strike awe in your heart,
[00:31:57.900 --> 00:32:00.900]   ask for that joy to be rekindled.
[00:32:00.900 --> 00:32:05.900]   Praise God for the blessings and the successes in your life.
[00:32:05.900 --> 00:32:08.900]   Pray for help in the areas of weakness.
[00:32:08.900 --> 00:32:13.900]   And perhaps if you are in a season of loss and trial,
[00:32:13.900 --> 00:32:18.900]   pray God that he would be glorified as you grieve,
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.900]   as you suffer, as you mourn,
[00:32:20.900 --> 00:32:24.900]   that he would be glorified just even in that process.
[00:32:24.900 --> 00:32:26.900]   So we're gonna do it like January,
[00:32:26.900 --> 00:32:30.900]   where we're gonna give you a few minutes to pray.
[00:32:30.900 --> 00:32:35.900]   The prayer team is gonna just lead us
[00:32:35.900 --> 00:32:38.900]   just in a time of music where we get to just pray.
[00:32:38.900 --> 00:32:40.900]   And after a couple minutes,
[00:32:40.900 --> 00:32:44.900]   they're gonna start singing the song that we've selected
[00:32:44.900 --> 00:32:47.900]   to kind of go along with the prayer points.
[00:32:47.900 --> 00:32:50.900]   And then after this first round,
[00:32:50.900 --> 00:32:52.900]   I'm gonna ask Pastor Nate to come up
[00:32:52.900 --> 00:32:55.900]   and just pray for us as a representative prayer.
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:33:00.900]   So why don't we go ahead and declare to the Lord
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:07.900]   why we love him and ask God for reminders a plenty tonight.
[00:33:09.900 --> 00:33:11.900]   For reasons for praise.
[00:33:11.900 --> 00:33:13.900]   Okay, and let's do that.
[00:33:13.900 --> 00:33:18.900]   (soft music)
[00:33:19.900 --> 00:33:22.900]   (soft music)

[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:02.080]   - God in the world and in our lives,
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:04.080]   and God, as we gather together,
[00:40:04.080 --> 00:40:06.080]   there's a lot of people around us.
[00:40:08.080 --> 00:40:10.080]   And Lord, we can't see it all.
[00:40:10.080 --> 00:40:15.080]   Father, we come to you though,
[00:40:15.080 --> 00:40:18.080]   without understanding or knowing everything,
[00:40:18.080 --> 00:40:23.080]   at least knowing this, God, that you're here with us
[00:40:23.080 --> 00:40:26.080]   and you are our strength, you're our rock,
[00:40:26.080 --> 00:40:28.080]   and you're our refuge.
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:33.080]   Father, we confess to you that we've been looking,
[00:40:33.080 --> 00:40:37.080]   trying to find our rock and our refuge in other places.
[00:40:38.080 --> 00:40:45.080]   Father, help us open our eyes, let us see.
[00:40:45.080 --> 00:40:53.080]   Lord, help us to stop struggling so much,
[00:40:53.080 --> 00:40:56.080]   trying so hard, Father, with our own strength
[00:40:56.080 --> 00:40:58.080]   to muster up faith and courage.
[00:40:58.080 --> 00:41:02.080]   Lord, allow our eyes simply to see you,
[00:41:02.080 --> 00:41:05.080]   that we might instinctively cling to you.
[00:41:05.080 --> 00:41:07.080]   That we might instinctively cling to you,
[00:41:07.080 --> 00:41:09.080]   call out for you.
[00:41:09.080 --> 00:41:16.080]   Lord, we feel like everything is
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:19.080]   so far out of our control right now.
[00:41:19.080 --> 00:41:24.080]   And that is our reality, and God, I pray
[00:41:24.080 --> 00:41:27.080]   that tonight you'd help us to draw near to you.
[00:41:27.080 --> 00:41:32.080]   Lord, thank you.
[00:41:33.080 --> 00:41:34.080]   We do love you.
[00:41:34.080 --> 00:41:37.080]   God, we love you with all our hearts.
[00:41:37.080 --> 00:41:40.080]   God, all we want is you.
[00:41:40.080 --> 00:41:44.080]   And so, Father, would you teach us
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.080]   to set aside all the busyness,
[00:41:46.080 --> 00:41:49.080]   all the other places that we've been perhaps
[00:41:49.080 --> 00:41:51.080]   turning to for peace,
[00:41:51.080 --> 00:41:54.080]   that we might find our comfort in you.
[00:41:54.080 --> 00:41:57.080]   Lord, help us to stop trying to be so strong
[00:41:57.080 --> 00:41:58.080]   of our own accord.
[00:41:58.080 --> 00:42:02.080]   Help us, Lord, to stop trying so hard
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:04.080]   to fight out of the darkness by ourselves.
[00:42:04.080 --> 00:42:06.080]   God, be our light.
[00:42:06.080 --> 00:42:10.080]   Guide us, Father.
[00:42:10.080 --> 00:42:14.080]   Help us to look up and see that you are
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:17.080]   our Father who desires to lead,
[00:42:17.080 --> 00:42:20.080]   to embrace, to love us.
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:24.080]   Lord, help us to be able to see
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:26.080]   all the things that are going on
[00:42:26.080 --> 00:42:27.080]   in the various trials,
[00:42:27.080 --> 00:42:29.080]   in all the different ways.
[00:42:31.080 --> 00:42:33.080]   God, that we might not be people who
[00:42:33.080 --> 00:42:38.080]   are constantly trying to convince ourselves
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:40.080]   of theological truths.
[00:42:40.080 --> 00:42:43.080]   But, Lord, we are people who see you
[00:42:43.080 --> 00:42:44.080]   and simply believe.
[00:42:44.080 --> 00:42:48.080]   God, would you simplify our prayers tonight?
[00:42:48.080 --> 00:42:51.080]   Would you simplify our desires?
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:55.080]   Lord, help us to just look up to you tonight
[00:42:55.080 --> 00:42:57.080]   and to sing, to praise you,
[00:42:57.080 --> 00:43:00.080]   and to pray to you and long to be near you.
[00:43:00.080 --> 00:43:02.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:43:02.080 --> 00:43:11.080]   I want to read Psalm 2, 1 through 6, for us.
[00:43:11.080 --> 00:43:14.080]   It reads,
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.080]   "Why are the nations in an uproar
[00:43:17.080 --> 00:43:22.080]   "and the peoples devising a vain thing?
[00:43:22.080 --> 00:43:25.080]   "The kings of the earth take their stand
[00:43:25.080 --> 00:43:29.080]   "and the rulers take counsel together.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:32.080]   "They take counsel together against the Lord
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:35.080]   "and against his anointed, saying,
[00:43:35.080 --> 00:43:38.080]   "'Let us tear their fetters apart
[00:43:38.080 --> 00:43:41.080]   "'and cast away their cords from us.'
[00:43:41.080 --> 00:43:46.080]   "He who sits in the heavens laughs
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:49.080]   "and the Lord scoffs at them.
[00:43:49.080 --> 00:43:53.080]   "Then he will speak to them in his anger
[00:43:53.080 --> 00:43:56.080]   "and terrify them in his fury,
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:43:59.080]   "saying, 'But as for me,
[00:43:59.080 --> 00:44:03.080]   "'I have installed my king upon Zion,
[00:44:03.080 --> 00:44:06.080]   "'my holy mountain.'"
[00:44:06.080 --> 00:44:09.080]   Just historically,
[00:44:09.080 --> 00:44:13.080]   the more intelligent
[00:44:13.080 --> 00:44:16.080]   and the more powerful a people's,
[00:44:16.080 --> 00:44:20.080]   a city, and a nation gets,
[00:44:20.080 --> 00:44:22.080]   the more self-reliant they become,
[00:44:22.080 --> 00:44:25.080]   the more arrogant they become,
[00:44:25.080 --> 00:44:29.080]   and traditionally, the more greedy they become.
[00:44:29.080 --> 00:44:33.080]   And almost to where they foolishly think
[00:44:33.080 --> 00:44:37.080]   there's nothing that could knock us off this pedestal.
[00:44:37.080 --> 00:44:42.080]   And here in Psalm 2,
[00:44:42.080 --> 00:44:46.080]   we see that the creator of the universe
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.080]   who is enthroned in the heavens
[00:44:49.080 --> 00:44:52.080]   is watching all this,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:56.080]   knowing that there's nothing that's out of his control.
[00:44:56.080 --> 00:44:59.080]   He is omniscient, he is omnipresent,
[00:44:59.080 --> 00:45:01.080]   he is omnipotent,
[00:45:01.080 --> 00:45:04.080]   and these puny creatures
[00:45:04.080 --> 00:45:06.080]   are rebelling,
[00:45:06.080 --> 00:45:08.080]   are scoffing,
[00:45:08.080 --> 00:45:12.080]   and are causing chaos.
[00:45:12.080 --> 00:45:15.080]   And they think they're at the center.
[00:45:15.080 --> 00:45:21.080]   And the reason I share this psalm with us tonight
[00:45:21.080 --> 00:45:24.080]   is that there are a lot of things
[00:45:24.080 --> 00:45:27.080]   that the sin of man
[00:45:27.080 --> 00:45:34.080]   is causing chaos in in the world around us today.
[00:45:34.080 --> 00:45:39.080]   And a lot of people on their social media profiles
[00:45:39.080 --> 00:45:41.080]   are talking about Ukraine,
[00:45:41.080 --> 00:45:43.080]   they're putting up the blue and yellow,
[00:45:43.080 --> 00:45:44.080]   "Pray for Ukraine,"
[00:45:44.080 --> 00:45:46.080]   and I wonder if actually they pray.
[00:45:46.080 --> 00:45:48.080]   They just put that up.
[00:45:49.080 --> 00:45:52.080]   But for us, we need to be watchful,
[00:45:52.080 --> 00:45:54.080]   we need to be hopeful, yes,
[00:45:54.080 --> 00:45:55.080]   and we need to be sober.
[00:45:55.080 --> 00:45:58.080]   As we see the things that are unfolding around us,
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:00.080]   starting even with the little things,
[00:46:00.080 --> 00:46:03.080]   to even like the scientific things,
[00:46:03.080 --> 00:46:05.080]   even the vaccine, the politics,
[00:46:05.080 --> 00:46:09.080]   global crises, and all of these things,
[00:46:09.080 --> 00:46:11.080]   we need to kind of calm down,
[00:46:11.080 --> 00:46:13.080]   not to place any blame,
[00:46:13.080 --> 00:46:15.080]   but to pray to God
[00:46:15.080 --> 00:46:17.080]   for him to move,
[00:46:17.080 --> 00:46:18.080]   for him to show his goodness,
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:22.080]   and for him to show himself to be God.
[00:46:22.080 --> 00:46:24.080]   And so tonight,
[00:46:24.080 --> 00:46:25.080]   we're gonna be praying for
[00:46:25.080 --> 00:46:28.080]   these three prayer topics.
[00:46:28.080 --> 00:46:32.080]   First, pray for our city and our state,
[00:46:32.080 --> 00:46:35.080]   that the Lord would give wisdom
[00:46:35.080 --> 00:46:36.080]   to the governing authorities.
[00:46:36.080 --> 00:46:39.080]   And whatever comes to your mind,
[00:46:39.080 --> 00:46:43.080]   ask God to be glorified in the things,
[00:46:43.080 --> 00:46:47.080]   and that he would empower and enable his people
[00:46:47.080 --> 00:46:49.080]   in these cities, in these states,
[00:46:49.080 --> 00:46:52.080]   really to shine the light of Christ.
[00:46:52.080 --> 00:46:55.080]   The second request that I would like
[00:46:55.080 --> 00:46:57.080]   for us all to beseech the Lord together in
[00:46:57.080 --> 00:46:59.080]   is pray for our nation,
[00:46:59.080 --> 00:47:01.080]   that there would be revival,
[00:47:01.080 --> 00:47:05.080]   that the light of Christ would shine in the darkness,
[00:47:05.080 --> 00:47:07.080]   and pray that God would raise up
[00:47:07.080 --> 00:47:11.080]   wise and selfless leaders who love and fear him.
[00:47:11.080 --> 00:47:13.080]   And with that,
[00:47:13.080 --> 00:47:16.080]   also please pray for the churches around us.
[00:47:16.080 --> 00:47:19.080]   That God would raise up just godly men and women,
[00:47:19.080 --> 00:47:22.080]   spiritual warriors who will know how to fight,
[00:47:22.080 --> 00:47:23.080]   when to fight, what to fight.
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:25.080]   So pray for them.
[00:47:25.080 --> 00:47:28.080]   Third, pray for those suffering because of the crises
[00:47:28.080 --> 00:47:31.080]   that we see in various parts of the world.
[00:47:31.080 --> 00:47:33.080]   Pray for the believers in those nations
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:36.080]   to persevere and to shine the light of Christ
[00:47:36.080 --> 00:47:38.080]   in their local contexts.
[00:47:38.080 --> 00:47:41.080]   There are videos and things of popping up
[00:47:41.080 --> 00:47:44.080]   of Christians trying to minister,
[00:47:45.080 --> 00:47:47.080]   even in the Ukraine and in this context now.
[00:47:47.080 --> 00:47:51.080]   And my encouragement really is to pray
[00:47:51.080 --> 00:47:54.080]   that God would be glorified,
[00:47:54.080 --> 00:47:55.080]   that the name of Jesus Christ
[00:47:55.080 --> 00:47:59.080]   would move powerfully in Europe,
[00:47:59.080 --> 00:48:03.080]   and that God would use his saints,
[00:48:03.080 --> 00:48:05.080]   whether in life or in death,
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:07.080]   really to proclaim his truth.
[00:48:07.080 --> 00:48:09.080]   So let's pray for those things.
[00:48:09.080 --> 00:48:14.080]   And then we will sing praise together.
[00:48:14.080 --> 00:48:16.080]   And then I'm going to ask Elder James Hong
[00:48:16.080 --> 00:48:18.080]   to come up and pray.
[00:48:18.080 --> 00:48:21.080]   But even when we start singing,
[00:48:21.080 --> 00:48:23.080]   if you really feel burdened to continue to pray,
[00:48:23.080 --> 00:48:25.080]   by all means, please do so.
[00:48:25.080 --> 00:48:28.080]   Okay, so we're going to join together
[00:48:28.080 --> 00:48:31.080]   and pray for these three topics.

[00:57:26.360 --> 00:57:30.360]   - Our brothers and sisters in Ukraine, in Russia,
[00:57:30.360 --> 00:57:33.360]   Lord, we know that many of them have already felt
[00:57:33.360 --> 00:57:36.360]   the devastating impact of war.
[00:57:36.360 --> 00:57:39.360]   We have brothers and sisters, perhaps even fighting
[00:57:39.360 --> 00:57:41.360]   in the Ukrainian army.
[00:57:41.360 --> 00:57:44.360]   We probably even have them in the Russian army,
[00:57:44.360 --> 00:57:48.360]   having to think over making difficult decisions, Lord.
[00:57:48.360 --> 00:57:51.360]   We know that some are protesting.
[00:57:51.360 --> 00:57:55.360]   Lord, we know that some are praying
[00:57:55.360 --> 00:57:59.360]   for the Ukrainians, Lord God, under this mess.
[00:57:59.360 --> 00:58:06.360]   And amidst this, Lord, we are so thankful
[00:58:06.360 --> 00:58:09.360]   for the promises in your word,
[00:58:09.360 --> 00:58:13.360]   that these are not just random events,
[00:58:13.360 --> 00:58:16.360]   that sinful man is not in control,
[00:58:16.360 --> 00:58:19.360]   but that we are indeed, Lord God,
[00:58:19.360 --> 00:58:24.360]   marching forward to the culmination of history
[00:58:24.360 --> 00:58:29.360]   when all flesh, all spiritual, all angels, all demons,
[00:58:29.360 --> 00:58:33.360]   everyone will see, Lord God, your blessed kingdom.
[00:58:33.360 --> 00:58:38.360]   And as every kingdom has risen and has fallen,
[00:58:38.360 --> 00:58:41.360]   yours will remain.
[00:58:41.360 --> 00:58:45.360]   And we are so thankful.
[00:58:45.360 --> 00:58:47.360]   We look forward to the day, Father,
[00:58:47.360 --> 00:58:52.360]   when the government will be upon his shoulders
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.360]   and there will be true justice,
[00:58:55.360 --> 00:58:57.360]   there will be true peace,
[00:58:57.360 --> 00:59:03.360]   and every eye will see, every knee will bow,
[00:59:03.360 --> 00:59:06.360]   and every tongue will confess
[00:59:06.360 --> 00:59:14.360]   that Jesus Christ is Lord of Lord and King of Kings.
[00:59:14.360 --> 00:59:16.360]   And so until that time, Father,
[00:59:16.360 --> 00:59:18.360]   we pray for our brothers and sisters, Lord,
[00:59:18.360 --> 00:59:20.360]   in every nation,
[00:59:20.360 --> 00:59:22.360]   that they would remain faithful,
[00:59:22.360 --> 00:59:25.360]   that even in the midst of tragedy, Lord God,
[00:59:25.360 --> 00:59:28.360]   they would remember that you are in control
[00:59:28.360 --> 00:59:30.360]   and that you are good,
[00:59:30.360 --> 00:59:32.360]   and that during this time,
[00:59:32.360 --> 00:59:35.360]   that above all else, Lord God,
[00:59:35.360 --> 00:59:40.360]   they would endeavor to share the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:59:40.360 --> 00:59:42.360]   that we would see Russian soldiers
[00:59:42.360 --> 00:59:44.360]   sharing the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:59:44.360 --> 00:59:46.360]   that we would see Ukrainian civilians and soldiers
[00:59:46.360 --> 00:59:49.360]   sharing the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:59:49.360 --> 00:59:51.360]   that world leaders would be informed
[00:59:51.360 --> 00:59:53.360]   of the good news of Jesus Christ,
[00:59:53.360 --> 00:59:56.360]   and that they will be held accountable, Father.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:59.360]   This gospel that is so precious,
[00:59:59.360 --> 01:00:03.360]   that cost the very life, Lord God, of the only begotten,
[01:00:03.360 --> 01:00:05.360]   help us, Lord God, to see the urgency
[01:00:05.360 --> 01:00:08.360]   and spread this good news to everyone we know,
[01:00:08.360 --> 01:00:12.360]   to connect it with every part of our very life, Father.
[01:00:12.360 --> 01:00:15.360]   And in so doing, remembering, Father, again,
[01:00:15.360 --> 01:00:18.360]   that you are in complete control of all things.
[01:00:18.360 --> 01:00:20.360]   Thank you, Lord, for being who you are.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:22.360]   We pray all these things in the name of your Son.
[01:00:22.360 --> 01:00:23.360]   Amen.
[01:00:23.360 --> 01:00:28.360]   In this third section,
[01:00:28.360 --> 01:00:32.360]   we're going to be praying that we as a church
[01:00:32.360 --> 01:00:36.360]   are watchful and prayerful and sober.
[01:00:36.360 --> 01:00:41.360]   And I want to read Matthew 24, 4-14 for us.
[01:00:41.360 --> 01:00:44.360]   It reads,
[01:00:44.360 --> 01:00:47.360]   [reading]
[01:00:48.360 --> 01:00:51.360]   [reading]
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:55.360]   [reading]
[01:00:56.360 --> 01:00:59.360]   [reading]
[01:00:59.360 --> 01:01:02.360]   [reading]
[01:01:03.360 --> 01:01:06.360]   [reading]
[01:01:06.360 --> 01:01:09.360]   [reading]
[01:01:09.360 --> 01:01:12.360]   [reading]
[01:01:12.360 --> 01:01:15.360]   [reading]
[01:01:15.360 --> 01:01:18.360]   [reading]
[01:01:19.360 --> 01:01:22.360]   [reading]
[01:01:22.360 --> 01:01:25.800]   nearly the beginning of birth pains.
[01:01:25.800 --> 01:01:28.980]   Then, they will deliver you to tribulation
[01:01:28.980 --> 01:01:33.280]   and will kill you and you will be hated by all nations
[01:01:33.280 --> 01:01:34.860]   because of my name.
[01:01:34.860 --> 01:01:38.820]   And at that time, many will fall away
[01:01:38.820 --> 01:01:43.320]   and will betray one another and hate one another.
[01:01:43.320 --> 01:01:46.020]   Many false prophets will arise
[01:01:46.020 --> 01:01:47.860]   and will mislead many.
[01:01:48.980 --> 01:01:52.560]   Because lawlessness is increased,
[01:01:52.560 --> 01:01:55.760]   most people's love will grow cold.
[01:01:55.760 --> 01:01:59.300]   But the one who endures to the end,
[01:01:59.300 --> 01:02:00.720]   he will be saved.
[01:02:00.720 --> 01:02:04.360]   This gospel of the kingdom shall be preached
[01:02:04.360 --> 01:02:07.260]   in the whole world as a testimony
[01:02:07.260 --> 01:02:11.840]   to all the nations and then the end will come.
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:15.660]   This passage is descriptive and not prescriptive.
[01:02:15.660 --> 01:02:17.680]   There's not necessarily an application
[01:02:17.680 --> 01:02:19.600]   that we can make from this.
[01:02:19.600 --> 01:02:22.680]   Most of it is a detailing of what's gonna happen.
[01:02:22.680 --> 01:02:24.920]   And some of you, as we are reading this,
[01:02:24.920 --> 01:02:28.760]   might think, oh man, this feels very familiar.
[01:02:28.760 --> 01:02:33.220]   And so, just in terms of being mindful,
[01:02:33.220 --> 01:02:39.740]   that we may be living in the beginning of the end,
[01:02:39.740 --> 01:02:42.700]   but Jesus says, don't be frightened.
[01:02:42.700 --> 01:02:46.200]   And he says a couple things that are hopeful for us
[01:02:46.200 --> 01:02:47.620]   that will happen.
[01:02:47.620 --> 01:02:51.180]   That the gospel's being preached.
[01:02:51.180 --> 01:02:53.240]   That it's gonna go forth.
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.860]   There is no human effort that can withstand that.
[01:02:57.860 --> 01:03:02.040]   But there's a lot of distractions that will come into play.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:04.840]   And Satan's strategy is always to divide
[01:03:04.840 --> 01:03:07.540]   and conquer and distract.
[01:03:07.540 --> 01:03:10.160]   But the gospel's gonna continue to go forth.
[01:03:10.160 --> 01:03:12.960]   And when I read this passage, primarily,
[01:03:12.960 --> 01:03:14.460]   as a local church,
[01:03:15.460 --> 01:03:19.220]   being watchful, being sober, being prayerful,
[01:03:19.220 --> 01:03:22.420]   what is it that we must do?
[01:03:22.420 --> 01:03:30.160]   Primarily, we need to help people to persevere.
[01:03:30.160 --> 01:03:37.380]   We need to help people to grow in salvation.
[01:03:41.380 --> 01:03:44.540]   We need to do our best to prevent love
[01:03:44.540 --> 01:03:48.140]   from getting cold and calloused.
[01:03:48.140 --> 01:03:51.900]   And we need to preach the gospel.
[01:03:51.900 --> 01:03:55.440]   God is on his throne.
[01:03:55.440 --> 01:03:58.080]   He is absolutely in control.
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:04:02.240]   Things that are happening are not surprising to him.
[01:04:02.240 --> 01:04:08.240]   But for us, our call is not to be sidetracked,
[01:04:08.240 --> 01:04:11.500]   but to stay watchful, sober, and mindful
[01:04:11.500 --> 01:04:15.900]   that he is sovereign and that he loves sinful people
[01:04:15.900 --> 01:04:17.820]   and he is saving souls.
[01:04:17.820 --> 01:04:21.280]   And our call is just to remain faithful
[01:04:21.280 --> 01:04:25.920]   to whatever task he's called us in our perseverance
[01:04:25.920 --> 01:04:29.120]   and in our participation with the Great Commission work.
[01:04:29.120 --> 01:04:33.280]   So the first couple things that I want us to just lift up,
[01:04:35.540 --> 01:04:37.880]   I have the prayer points up.
[01:04:37.880 --> 01:04:42.540]   Pray that our leaders will lead well in watchfulness,
[01:04:42.540 --> 01:04:46.620]   in courage and boldness, and in Christ-like love.
[01:04:46.620 --> 01:04:51.180]   Intercede on behalf of the leaders of the church.
[01:04:51.180 --> 01:04:54.880]   And if you have friends who are at other churches,
[01:04:54.880 --> 01:04:58.940]   who are, who may be leaders at other churches,
[01:04:58.940 --> 01:05:00.800]   pray for them as well.
[01:05:00.800 --> 01:05:04.540]   Pray that God would keep men of God sober,
[01:05:04.540 --> 01:05:06.700]   faithful, and perseverant.
[01:05:06.700 --> 01:05:12.180]   Secondly, you guys know that our young adults
[01:05:12.180 --> 01:05:14.100]   are now all on their way up,
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.760]   if they're not already there, to retreat.
[01:05:17.760 --> 01:05:19.340]   Pray for our band members that the retreat
[01:05:19.340 --> 01:05:21.380]   will be a time where fears are stilled,
[01:05:21.380 --> 01:05:23.620]   where passions are rekindled,
[01:05:23.620 --> 01:05:26.760]   and where hearts are refreshed.
[01:05:26.760 --> 01:05:28.340]   I'm sure there are a lot of different distractions
[01:05:28.340 --> 01:05:29.880]   and things that are going on,
[01:05:29.880 --> 01:05:32.600]   but pray that that place will be protected
[01:05:32.600 --> 01:05:35.360]   and that God will really minister well to
[01:05:35.360 --> 01:05:38.400]   our brothers and sisters that are there.
[01:05:38.400 --> 01:05:40.000]   Pray for the strengthening of the various
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.620]   affinity groups in our church,
[01:05:42.620 --> 01:05:46.240]   especially to the one that you belong to.
[01:05:46.240 --> 01:05:47.740]   And also pray that God will raise up
[01:05:47.740 --> 01:05:49.940]   the next generation of godly men and women
[01:05:49.940 --> 01:05:52.440]   in our youth and our children.
[01:05:52.440 --> 01:05:56.680]   I don't feel like I'm in this generation
[01:05:56.680 --> 01:06:00.840]   that's gonna receive and feel the heaviest of persecutions.
[01:06:00.840 --> 01:06:05.080]   My prayer for Maddie and Karis really is my kids,
[01:06:05.080 --> 01:06:06.700]   that when they have to fight,
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.500]   and the fighting is a lot more severe,
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.740]   that they would know how to fight well.
[01:06:10.740 --> 01:06:13.040]   And I'm praying for wisdom on my end
[01:06:13.040 --> 01:06:15.380]   to train them to fight well.
[01:06:15.380 --> 01:06:18.460]   And can you join me in praying also
[01:06:18.460 --> 01:06:21.740]   for the future of our children?
[01:06:21.740 --> 01:06:24.280]   That they would be a generation that really knows
[01:06:24.280 --> 01:06:26.340]   the word of God, loves the word of God,
[01:06:26.340 --> 01:06:28.820]   lives it out, and helps others to do the same,
[01:06:28.820 --> 01:06:31.320]   especially as the world grows more and more hostile.
[01:06:31.320 --> 01:06:33.520]   So pray for these things.
[01:06:33.520 --> 01:06:35.320]   If you feel like, man, that's a lot to pray for
[01:06:35.320 --> 01:06:38.720]   in two, three minutes, just focus on one,
[01:06:38.720 --> 01:06:40.500]   and just pray passionately.
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.880]   And then at the end, after we sing,
[01:06:42.880 --> 01:06:45.940]   Elder Phillip will come up and close our time
[01:06:45.940 --> 01:06:47.700]   for that third round.

[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:41.000]   - All right, let's pray.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:45.800]   Heavenly Father, I just wanna thank you, Lord God,
[01:13:45.800 --> 01:13:48.540]   for giving us the privilege to gather together as a body,
[01:13:48.540 --> 01:13:51.640]   as a church, so that we could pray.
[01:13:51.640 --> 01:13:54.000]   And you have called us to pray, Lord.
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:58.100]   Called us to seek your face, Lord God,
[01:13:58.100 --> 01:14:00.680]   only by the power that is given to us
[01:14:00.680 --> 01:14:02.420]   through the blood of Jesus Christ,
[01:14:02.420 --> 01:14:06.060]   the precious lamb, Lord, who became a sacrifice
[01:14:06.060 --> 01:14:09.140]   for our sins, a substitution, Father God.
[01:14:09.140 --> 01:14:12.600]   Lord, as we meditate on that, Father,
[01:14:12.600 --> 01:14:15.520]   Lord, we know that in our own strength,
[01:14:15.520 --> 01:14:17.480]   or even our limited words, Father,
[01:14:17.480 --> 01:14:21.340]   that we can't, by our own power and strength,
[01:14:21.340 --> 01:14:26.220]   Lord, seek to achieve what Christ has achieved, Lord God.
[01:14:26.220 --> 01:14:28.340]   So we come to you in prayer.
[01:14:28.340 --> 01:14:30.340]   We come to you in humbleness,
[01:14:30.340 --> 01:14:33.060]   acknowledging our weakness, acknowledging, Lord God,
[01:14:33.060 --> 01:14:34.460]   that you are our strength,
[01:14:34.460 --> 01:14:37.140]   and only by your power and your strength, Lord God,
[01:14:37.140 --> 01:14:40.460]   that can we even make it a day, Father God,
[01:14:40.460 --> 01:14:45.420]   that we are sinners before a holy and holy God, Father,
[01:14:45.420 --> 01:14:48.600]   that we are weak, that we are weak in our discipline,
[01:14:48.600 --> 01:14:51.100]   we are weak, Lord God, in our faith,
[01:14:51.100 --> 01:14:52.660]   but Lord God, we look to Christ
[01:14:52.660 --> 01:14:54.460]   and what he has done on the cross,
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:56.560]   and we just thank you, Heavenly Father.
[01:14:56.560 --> 01:15:00.140]   And that's all we could do is lift the words of praise
[01:15:00.140 --> 01:15:02.340]   for you are worthy, Father God.
[01:15:02.340 --> 01:15:05.020]   I just pray that for our church, Lord,
[01:15:05.020 --> 01:15:07.680]   one of many, many churches, Lord God,
[01:15:07.680 --> 01:15:09.180]   what distinguishes us, Lord,
[01:15:09.180 --> 01:15:12.060]   from any other church that is around our community
[01:15:12.060 --> 01:15:14.940]   in this world, Father, it doesn't.
[01:15:14.940 --> 01:15:17.720]   Lord, I pray, Father, from the leadership
[01:15:17.720 --> 01:15:21.560]   down to every member, that you would cause us, Lord God,
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:25.060]   to consider our identity in Christ,
[01:15:25.060 --> 01:15:27.060]   what we have received in Christ.
[01:15:27.060 --> 01:15:29.160]   So I pray for our leadership, Lord,
[01:15:29.160 --> 01:15:31.660]   that you would keep our leadership humble,
[01:15:31.660 --> 01:15:33.980]   you would keep our leadership, Lord God,
[01:15:33.980 --> 01:15:36.860]   hungry and dedicated, Father God,
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:40.060]   to the word and just to prayer.
[01:15:40.060 --> 01:15:43.080]   Father, we pray, Lord God, that you would watch over them,
[01:15:43.080 --> 01:15:44.740]   that you would cause them, Lord God,
[01:15:44.740 --> 01:15:49.740]   to grow in you and to continue to rekindle the first love.
[01:15:49.740 --> 01:15:52.300]   Pray, Heavenly Father, for the BAM retreat
[01:15:52.300 --> 01:15:54.420]   as they are gathering together, Lord.
[01:15:54.420 --> 01:15:56.220]   I pray that they would realize
[01:15:56.220 --> 01:15:59.000]   what a special moment it is, Lord,
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:02.180]   to get away from the world and the distractions, Lord God,
[01:16:02.180 --> 01:16:07.180]   to take time to worship, to pray.
[01:16:07.180 --> 01:16:09.180]   Lord, I pray, Father God,
[01:16:09.180 --> 01:16:11.820]   that there will be a strong sense, Lord,
[01:16:11.820 --> 01:16:16.220]   of heaviness, Lord God, the weight of the gospel,
[01:16:16.220 --> 01:16:18.180]   the weight, Father God, that will cause them
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:20.980]   to reconsider and rekindle, Father.
[01:16:20.980 --> 01:16:23.980]   So we pray for our brothers and sisters at that retreat.
[01:16:23.980 --> 01:16:27.220]   Pray for Pastor Mark, Lord God, as he leads, Father,
[01:16:27.220 --> 01:16:32.180]   that we would see your spirit working in our BAM ministry.
[01:16:32.180 --> 01:16:35.380]   We also pray for our other affinity groups, Lord God,
[01:16:35.380 --> 01:16:41.740]   the couples, especially, Lord, as young couples
[01:16:41.740 --> 01:16:45.920]   and married and as they have children,
[01:16:45.920 --> 01:16:49.820]   as going through various different stages of life
[01:16:49.820 --> 01:16:51.740]   or business and tiredness.
[01:16:51.740 --> 01:16:54.900]   Father God, I pray that you would give them soberness
[01:16:54.900 --> 01:16:58.940]   to understand, Lord, that Satan is trying to cause them,
[01:16:58.940 --> 01:17:03.900]   Lord God, their desire for you to be cold.
[01:17:03.900 --> 01:17:07.420]   But I pray, Lord, that they would be alert, sober,
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:11.540]   and to make that much more of an effort to seek you.
[01:17:11.540 --> 01:17:14.160]   And in their tiredness, that you would comfort
[01:17:14.160 --> 01:17:16.460]   and give them strength, Lord God.
[01:17:16.460 --> 01:17:19.300]   Also, we pray for our young ones, Lord God,
[01:17:19.300 --> 01:17:21.300]   that you would first give the conviction
[01:17:21.300 --> 01:17:24.060]   to our parents, Lord, to each parent, Father,
[01:17:24.060 --> 01:17:28.260]   to live in such a way that will be an example
[01:17:28.260 --> 01:17:29.540]   to our young ones, Lord God,
[01:17:29.540 --> 01:17:31.700]   so that we might raise a generation
[01:17:31.700 --> 01:17:33.620]   who will take the mantle of the gospel
[01:17:33.620 --> 01:17:35.700]   and do more than we have, Father,
[01:17:35.700 --> 01:17:39.020]   that they would be convicted because of the examples
[01:17:39.020 --> 01:17:40.240]   that they have seen.
[01:17:40.240 --> 01:17:44.060]   So I pray, Lord, that you would raise up young,
[01:17:44.060 --> 01:17:49.060]   hungry, Lord, your soldiers, Lord God, ambassadors
[01:17:49.060 --> 01:17:51.420]   in our young ones, Father.
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:53.400]   So I just wanted to thank you
[01:17:53.400 --> 01:17:55.380]   and acknowledge, Lord, your goodness,
[01:17:55.380 --> 01:17:57.720]   and I pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[01:17:57.720 --> 01:18:03.660]   - All right, for our last round of prayer topics,
[01:18:03.660 --> 01:18:06.240]   before we break off and pray together,
[01:18:06.240 --> 01:18:11.240]   I wanna read Colossians 4, 2-6 as an exhortation to us.
[01:18:11.240 --> 01:18:15.900]   It reads, "Devote yourselves to prayer,
[01:18:15.900 --> 01:18:19.740]   "keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving."
[01:18:19.740 --> 01:18:22.460]   So just by way of reminder,
[01:18:22.460 --> 01:18:25.600]   our praise and prayer night doesn't end here.
[01:18:25.600 --> 01:18:29.700]   You take that home and that you lift up at home
[01:18:29.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   these topics and that you continue to do so.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:35.900]   So with an attitude of thanksgiving,
[01:18:35.900 --> 01:18:39.240]   praying at the same time for us as well,
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:42.740]   that God will open up to us a door for the word
[01:18:42.740 --> 01:18:46.480]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ
[01:18:46.480 --> 01:18:49.340]   for which I have also been imprisoned,
[01:18:49.340 --> 01:18:52.080]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak.
[01:18:52.080 --> 01:18:56.500]   Conduct yourselves with wisdom toward outsiders,
[01:18:56.500 --> 01:18:58.940]   making the most of your opportunity,
[01:18:58.940 --> 01:19:01.640]   and let your speech always be with grace
[01:19:01.640 --> 01:19:03.940]   as though seasoned with salt
[01:19:03.940 --> 01:19:08.160]   so that you will know how you should respond to each person.
[01:19:08.160 --> 01:19:11.500]   So this is the prayer request of a missionary in prison
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:17.940]   who's asking that God would help him to speak clearly.
[01:19:17.940 --> 01:19:22.940]   To speak clearly, that which is humanly difficult to speak,
[01:19:22.940 --> 01:19:28.020]   the mystery of Christ.
[01:19:28.020 --> 01:19:33.020]   And so we're gonna be praying for just the proclamation
[01:19:33.020 --> 01:19:37.460]   of the message of God to unbelievers.
[01:19:37.460 --> 01:19:39.560]   We're gonna pray specifically for this.
[01:19:39.560 --> 01:19:44.840]   The first prayer point is just,
[01:19:44.840 --> 01:19:47.560]   we have upcoming the evangelism outing
[01:19:47.560 --> 01:19:49.920]   at the source and the spectrum
[01:19:49.920 --> 01:19:54.920]   that'll take place at the beginning of March and April.
[01:19:54.920 --> 01:19:57.620]   So pray that the teams that go,
[01:19:57.620 --> 01:20:01.780]   it is daunting to go and just approach strangers,
[01:20:01.780 --> 01:20:04.020]   but pray that God would give them not just boldness,
[01:20:04.020 --> 01:20:05.480]   but a lot of compassion
[01:20:05.480 --> 01:20:07.920]   so that they're not treating people like projects,
[01:20:07.920 --> 01:20:09.220]   but really souls to be saved.
[01:20:09.220 --> 01:20:10.400]   So pray for that.
[01:20:10.400 --> 01:20:14.680]   And there are loved ones in your life,
[01:20:14.680 --> 01:20:18.080]   I'm sure, that don't know Christ.
[01:20:18.080 --> 01:20:20.500]   So pray for their salvation.
[01:20:20.500 --> 01:20:24.180]   Also pray that you will take advantage
[01:20:24.180 --> 01:20:26.720]   of the opportunities to share the gospel with them,
[01:20:26.720 --> 01:20:29.640]   especially with the Pastor Week and Easter coming up,
[01:20:29.640 --> 01:20:32.280]   that you would be bold and sensitive
[01:20:32.280 --> 01:20:34.820]   to the opportunities that avail themselves.
[01:20:34.820 --> 01:20:36.820]   Third, we're gonna be praying for our Indian pastors
[01:20:36.820 --> 01:20:39.420]   and the ministry that is taking place in India,
[01:20:39.420 --> 01:20:44.060]   where the suffering and the persecution is a constant,
[01:20:44.060 --> 01:20:45.420]   it's a given.
[01:20:45.420 --> 01:20:48.180]   And let's pray that they would bear much fruit.
[01:20:48.180 --> 01:20:51.320]   And let's pray that God would empower them
[01:20:51.320 --> 01:20:53.000]   to continue to speak,
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:55.520]   and that their children and their children's children
[01:20:55.520 --> 01:20:57.920]   will also take the baton
[01:20:57.920 --> 01:21:01.900]   and just grow to really be passionate conduits
[01:21:01.900 --> 01:21:04.120]   of the gospel of Christ.
[01:21:04.120 --> 01:21:08.340]   And we're gonna pray for two families that we love,
[01:21:08.340 --> 01:21:12.560]   that the Han family, Pastor Alex and his family
[01:21:12.560 --> 01:21:15.340]   that are here, pray for them,
[01:21:15.340 --> 01:21:16.820]   that God would hasten the day
[01:21:16.820 --> 01:21:20.180]   where they actually can get back into their field,
[01:21:20.180 --> 01:21:22.180]   and pray that God would help them
[01:21:22.180 --> 01:21:24.300]   to maximize their time here.
[01:21:24.300 --> 01:21:26.980]   And for the Tongs as well, for Harry and Linda,
[01:21:26.980 --> 01:21:30.520]   that God will open up doors for them to return
[01:21:30.520 --> 01:21:34.140]   to the field that they desire to go back into,
[01:21:34.140 --> 01:21:35.820]   and in the process of waiting,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:37.740]   that God would help them to be fruitful.
[01:21:37.740 --> 01:21:39.740]   So pray for those things,
[01:21:39.740 --> 01:21:41.760]   and then I'll wrap it up
[01:21:41.760 --> 01:21:44.300]   after we take a time of praise as well.
[01:21:44.300 --> 01:21:52.900]   (gentle piano music)
[01:21:52.900 --> 01:21:56.820]   (gentle piano music continues)

[01:28:55.940 --> 01:28:57.660]   just to pray for each other.
[01:28:57.660 --> 01:28:59.940]   So if you guys can just grab,
[01:28:59.940 --> 01:29:01.300]   maybe just one or two people,
[01:29:01.300 --> 01:29:03.620]   if you're here with just your spouse or your family,
[01:29:03.620 --> 01:29:05.100]   you guys just pray together.
[01:29:05.100 --> 01:29:08.820]   If you're here just alone,
[01:29:08.820 --> 01:29:11.940]   maybe partner up with one or two people
[01:29:11.940 --> 01:29:14.060]   and just intercede for each other.
[01:29:14.060 --> 01:29:17.140]   This is not a time to share your life story,
[01:29:17.140 --> 01:29:18.140]   it's a time to pray.

[01:39:56.020 --> 01:40:04.700]   and I wanna end with a reading of Psalm 150.
[01:40:07.700 --> 01:40:11.180]   It's a short psalm with just six verses,
[01:40:11.180 --> 01:40:13.420]   but it would be only appropriate
[01:40:13.420 --> 01:40:17.260]   as we've entrusted our burdens to the Lord
[01:40:17.260 --> 01:40:19.660]   to just end the night in praising him
[01:40:19.660 --> 01:40:24.020]   and just really submitting ourselves to his sovereignty.
[01:40:24.020 --> 01:40:27.980]   And here's what Psalm 150 says.
[01:40:27.980 --> 01:40:31.580]   Praise the Lord, praise God in his sanctuary,
[01:40:31.580 --> 01:40:34.460]   praise him in his mighty expanse,
[01:40:34.460 --> 01:40:36.380]   praise him for his mighty deeds,
[01:40:36.380 --> 01:40:39.220]   praise him according to his excellent greatness,
[01:40:39.220 --> 01:40:41.180]   praise him with trumpet sound,
[01:40:41.180 --> 01:40:43.180]   praise him with harp and lyre,
[01:40:43.180 --> 01:40:45.380]   praise him with timbrel and dancing,
[01:40:45.380 --> 01:40:47.740]   praise him with stringed instruments and pipe,
[01:40:47.740 --> 01:40:49.740]   praise him with loud cymbals,
[01:40:49.740 --> 01:40:51.860]   praise him with resounding cymbals,
[01:40:51.860 --> 01:40:54.820]   let everything that has breath,
[01:40:54.820 --> 01:40:57.260]   praise the Lord, praise the Lord.
[01:40:57.260 --> 01:41:01.620]   We're gonna wrap up just with two songs of praise,
[01:41:01.620 --> 01:41:03.700]   and as we sing these songs,
[01:41:03.700 --> 01:41:07.220]   may they remind you just of his goodness and his kindness,

[01:52:19.580 --> 01:52:21.580]   that you have given us,
