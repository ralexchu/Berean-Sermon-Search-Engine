[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.800]   All right, good morning everybody.
[00:00:05.800 --> 00:00:12.080]   If you can join me in prayer, I'd like to just seek God's favor and blessing over our
[00:00:12.080 --> 00:00:13.080]   time together.
[00:00:13.080 --> 00:00:16.480]   So please bow your heads with me.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:25.720]   Lord, we have gathered here this morning to hear from your word and to ask that you would
[00:00:25.720 --> 00:00:32.800]   help us to just be attentive, God, to your voice, help us to discern, God, how you would
[00:00:32.800 --> 00:00:37.840]   have us live and apply what we see today and hear today.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:43.840]   I pray for your provision and protection over our time together.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:49.200]   Lord, would you be magnified through just every aspect of our service.
[00:00:49.200 --> 00:00:53.920]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:53.920 --> 00:01:00.200]   Well last week we started a series on our church's tenfold covenant and Pastor Mark
[00:01:00.200 --> 00:01:07.440]   started it off with covenant number one, which is I confess Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[00:01:07.440 --> 00:01:14.640]   And today we're going to be covering covenants two and five together because they are related.
[00:01:14.640 --> 00:01:18.520]   And because one directly leads to the other, we will be combining the second and fifth
[00:01:18.520 --> 00:01:22.500]   covenants for the purposes of our sermon today.
[00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:26.440]   So I'd like to read the covenants for you.
[00:01:26.440 --> 00:01:32.720]   Just number one was I confess Jesus as my Lord and Savior, and here are two and five.
[00:01:32.720 --> 00:01:38.260]   Covenant number two, I confess that the Bible is the inerrant word of God, which has ultimate
[00:01:38.260 --> 00:01:40.880]   authority over my life.
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.920]   And covenant number five, I commit to attending and preparing for weekday Bible studies every
[00:01:46.920 --> 00:01:50.640]   week to the best of my ability.
[00:01:50.640 --> 00:01:55.960]   So if I'm confessing that the word of God has ultimate authority over my life, I absolutely
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.940]   must commit to devoting myself to the study of it.
[00:01:59.940 --> 00:02:03.760]   And as most of you guys know, the teaching of the word of God is one of the, just the
[00:02:03.760 --> 00:02:08.040]   main, if not the main, priorities at our church.
[00:02:08.040 --> 00:02:11.420]   And we want to lead you in reading the word of God.
[00:02:11.420 --> 00:02:16.040]   We want to help you to study the word of God, to share the word of God, to love the word
[00:02:16.040 --> 00:02:19.100]   of God, and to live it out.
[00:02:19.100 --> 00:02:25.640]   And ultimately, Lord willing, we want to guide you and lead you to also help others to love
[00:02:25.640 --> 00:02:30.160]   the word of God and to live out the word of God and to share it.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:33.080]   And you guys know the name of our church?
[00:02:33.080 --> 00:02:35.160]   Most of you guys, 100% of you guys probably should.
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:41.080]   We're called Berean Community Church, after the community of Christians at Berea in Acts
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:46.560]   1711, who not only listened to Apostle Paul's teaching with great eagerness, they really
[00:02:46.560 --> 00:02:51.440]   wanted to hear from God through this man, but at the same time, they poured through
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:55.740]   the scriptures, they combed through the Old Testament, which was at their access, to see
[00:02:55.740 --> 00:03:01.960]   if everything that he was saying was in line with what they believed to be true.
[00:03:01.960 --> 00:03:05.760]   Last week, Pastor Mark started his sermon off with a reading through a section of Matthew
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:11.400]   chapter 7, and we're going to actually take a deeper dive into Matthew chapter 7, and
[00:03:11.400 --> 00:03:17.720]   we'll be expanding on this, and under the idea of what Christ's Lordship means in relation
[00:03:17.720 --> 00:03:19.600]   to our study of the word of God.
[00:03:19.600 --> 00:03:26.240]   Okay, so I'm going to be reading Matthew 7, 13, just to start us off.
[00:03:26.240 --> 00:03:30.680]   Enter through the narrow gate, for the gate is wide, and the way is broad that leads to
[00:03:30.680 --> 00:03:32.120]   destruction.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.520]   And there are many who enter through it, for the gate is small, and the way is narrow that
[00:03:36.520 --> 00:03:38.400]   leads to life.
[00:03:38.400 --> 00:03:40.340]   And there are few who find it.
[00:03:40.340 --> 00:03:44.120]   So here we see that there are two eternal destinations.
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:47.120]   There are only two paths leading to their respective entrances.
[00:03:47.120 --> 00:03:51.160]   You have the wide and the broad, and then you have the small and the narrow.
[00:03:51.160 --> 00:03:56.120]   The wide and the broad lead to destruction, the small and the narrow lead to life.
[00:03:56.120 --> 00:04:02.260]   And Jesus exhorts all of the people who are hearing this to enter through the narrow.
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:07.480]   So the invitation is there, but he also says that tragically, many will find themselves
[00:04:07.480 --> 00:04:13.120]   having declined the invitation, and Jesus gives us a very sobering glimpse into the
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:18.920]   spiritual reality by saying that there are many headed for destruction and only a few
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:19.920]   headed for life.
[00:04:19.920 --> 00:04:24.320]   So in 2003, you guys know the Barnett Research Group?
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.320]   Yeah.
[00:04:25.320 --> 00:04:29.440]   The Barnett Research Group conducted a survey in America, you can actually look through
[00:04:29.440 --> 00:04:33.160]   that online, of their beliefs on the afterlife.
[00:04:33.160 --> 00:04:37.960]   So 2003 survey on Americans and their view on the afterlife.
[00:04:37.960 --> 00:04:44.520]   Of the Americans surveyed, 81% believed in an afterlife.
[00:04:44.520 --> 00:04:48.960]   So about a fifth of Americans said, "Nah, I reject that completely," but 81% believed
[00:04:48.960 --> 00:04:50.120]   in the afterlife.
[00:04:50.120 --> 00:04:56.800]   And of the Americans surveyed, 64% believed that they would go to heaven.
[00:04:56.800 --> 00:05:03.080]   And of the Americans surveyed, 0.5% believed that they would go to hell.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.200]   So for the Americans who believe in the existence of an afterlife, basically most of them believe
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:13.760]   themselves to be fit for heaven, while very, very, very, very few believe themselves to
[00:05:13.760 --> 00:05:16.040]   be headed to hell.
[00:05:16.040 --> 00:05:21.900]   So according to this survey, the Americans of 2003 believed that they were on their way
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:24.640]   to heaven, most of them.
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:29.320]   And so they believe the very opposite of what we see in Matthew 7, 13 to 14.
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.560]   Generally, the Americans of 2003 and likewise, the Americans that are around you and me today
[00:05:34.560 --> 00:05:38.480]   in 2019, have a high view of themselves.
[00:05:38.480 --> 00:05:44.360]   We are super confident in our morality and our goodness, we believe that our way is right.
[00:05:44.360 --> 00:05:50.240]   And so these surveys actually reflect the opinions and the views that each individual
[00:05:50.240 --> 00:05:51.240]   has.
[00:05:51.240 --> 00:05:57.440]   And as you and I both know, that personal views, opinions, and preferences matter very
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:06:00.800]   little when it comes to the matters of faith.
[00:06:00.800 --> 00:06:05.520]   So truth is truth, regardless of our opinions of it.
[00:06:05.520 --> 00:06:10.920]   So Jesus says that there's a wide and a broad for destruction, and many are on that road
[00:06:10.920 --> 00:06:14.720]   and enter through it, and they're bound for condemnation, destruction.
[00:06:14.720 --> 00:06:17.940]   And there is a small and a narrow, and only a few find it.
[00:06:17.940 --> 00:06:18.940]   So those are the realities.
[00:06:18.940 --> 00:06:24.640]   And Jesus continues in verse 15, "Beware of the false prophets who come to you in sheep's
[00:06:24.640 --> 00:06:28.140]   clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves.
[00:06:28.140 --> 00:06:31.200]   You will know them by their fruits.
[00:06:31.200 --> 00:06:35.720]   Grapes are not gathered from thorn bushes nor figs from thistles, are they?
[00:06:35.720 --> 00:06:40.600]   So every tree bears good fruit, or every good tree bears good fruit, but the bad tree bears
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:41.600]   bad fruit.
[00:06:41.600 --> 00:06:45.640]   A good tree cannot produce bad fruit, nor can a bad tree produce good fruit.
[00:06:45.640 --> 00:06:48.840]   Every tree that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the fire.
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:52.560]   So then you will know them by their fruits."
[00:06:52.560 --> 00:06:57.400]   So Jesus continues, "He warns that there are false prophets on these roads.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:03.560]   So they look gentle, meek, friendly, harmless enough, but inwardly they are seeking to tear
[00:07:03.560 --> 00:07:09.160]   you apart from limb to limb and to devour you, and they are ravenous."
[00:07:09.160 --> 00:07:15.160]   But Jesus says that though they may be disguised, there is actually a way for you to discern
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:16.920]   and recognize them.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:22.080]   So you can distinguish a false prophet from a good one by their fruits.
[00:07:22.080 --> 00:07:25.040]   Sounds simple.
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:27.600]   Let me pause and ask you guys a question.
[00:07:27.600 --> 00:07:32.440]   Can you spot a false prophet when you see one?
[00:07:32.440 --> 00:07:35.360]   Can you spot a false prophet if you see one?
[00:07:35.360 --> 00:07:39.080]   If it is obvious to everyone that that person is a false prophet, that guy is not going
[00:07:39.080 --> 00:07:41.160]   to have a long career as a false prophet.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:45.040]   If it's everyone that that guy is teaching such weird stuff that it is clear that he
[00:07:45.040 --> 00:07:48.160]   is a false prophet, that's a bad false prophet.
[00:07:48.160 --> 00:07:49.760]   Right?
[00:07:49.760 --> 00:07:52.760]   So can you discern falsehood from truth?
[00:07:52.760 --> 00:07:57.920]   Can you pick out a false prophet from a speaker of truth?
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:02.160]   Now this is not an exhortation for you guys to think through just a catalog of all the
[00:08:02.160 --> 00:08:03.160]   people that you know.
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:04.320]   "Huh, that guy is a false prophet.
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.880]   Oh no, I think that guy is good."
[00:08:05.880 --> 00:08:07.060]   That's not the exhortation here.
[00:08:07.060 --> 00:08:11.220]   That's not a charge for you guys to go on a witch hunt.
[00:08:11.220 --> 00:08:17.080]   But this is a skill, the discernment of a truth versus discernment of a false, between
[00:08:17.080 --> 00:08:18.680]   the false and the truth.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:25.240]   That is a skill of utmost importance as many of these false prophets, Jesus says, are on
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:27.520]   the broad and the wide.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.800]   And they are there to deceive.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:34.680]   And I bet that many of these on the broad and the wide are absolutely convinced that
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.560]   if they were to meet a false prophet, they would be immediately be able to pick one out.
[00:08:40.560 --> 00:08:44.680]   So a lot of these people on the broad and the wide are probably thinking, "The false
[00:08:44.680 --> 00:08:49.000]   prophets are probably the weirdos on that side."
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.920]   So they believe that the false prophets are on the small and the narrow, and they're likely
[00:08:53.920 --> 00:08:58.620]   to be the ones that are being duped by these religious false prophets.
[00:08:58.620 --> 00:09:00.080]   So Jesus continues.
[00:09:00.080 --> 00:09:02.880]   So there is a wide and a broad that leads to destruction, many enter through it.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:06.000]   There's a small and a wide that leads to life, only a few find it.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:08.120]   False prophets are on the road.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:11.320]   And so he's going to continue on.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:15.720]   Not everyone who says to me, "Lord, Lord," will enter the kingdom of heaven, but he who
[00:09:15.720 --> 00:09:19.020]   does the will of my Father who is in heaven will enter.
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:24.600]   Many will say to me on that day, "Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your
[00:09:24.600 --> 00:09:29.600]   name cast out demons and in your name perform many miracles?"
[00:09:29.600 --> 00:09:32.320]   And then I will declare to them, "I never knew you.
[00:09:32.320 --> 00:09:36.700]   Depart from me, you who practice lawlessness."
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:41.000]   So Jesus is saying there is a group of people here that have submitted themselves to the
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.360]   lordship of Christ and enter the kingdom, but it's not everyone.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:49.160]   There is a group that has entered the kingdom.
[00:09:49.160 --> 00:09:53.080]   In verse 21, he says, "Not everyone."
[00:09:53.080 --> 00:09:58.760]   So there is a group that receives this ultimate eternal rejection, and these are the guys
[00:09:58.760 --> 00:10:04.360]   on the broad and the wide, and perhaps they include the false prophets.
[00:10:04.360 --> 00:10:07.080]   So who are these people that are rejected?
[00:10:07.080 --> 00:10:13.760]   First, they're rejected despite their profession of Lord, Lord.
[00:10:13.760 --> 00:10:19.560]   So these on the broad and the wide recognize Jesus as Lord.
[00:10:19.560 --> 00:10:22.040]   So they have the correct faith paradigm.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:27.280]   They recognize Christ's lordship, and that's not surprising as Scripture teaches us at
[00:10:27.280 --> 00:10:31.640]   the name of Jesus, "Every knee will bow in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and
[00:10:31.640 --> 00:10:37.800]   every tongue confess that Jesus is Lord."
[00:10:37.800 --> 00:10:43.480]   So recognition of his lordship, we can conclude easily, is not enough.
[00:10:43.480 --> 00:10:47.840]   Secondly, these guys are prophesying in the name of Jesus.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:52.760]   So prophesying in the New Testament has more to do with teaching and exhorting properly
[00:10:52.760 --> 00:10:56.920]   than it does like a foreseeing of the future.
[00:10:56.920 --> 00:11:04.640]   So it appears that these guys on the broad and the wide not only recognize Christ's lordship,
[00:11:04.640 --> 00:11:09.200]   they have been teaching in Jesus' name as well.
[00:11:09.200 --> 00:11:14.480]   Third, they're casting out demons and performing many miracles.
[00:11:14.480 --> 00:11:20.320]   Now if I were to bring you a legitimately demon-possessed person and we brought him
[00:11:20.320 --> 00:11:26.880]   to the front like they do on TV, okay, and I cast out the demon from him, some of you
[00:11:26.880 --> 00:11:32.640]   will be skeptical, some of you may be in awe that I have that kind of power.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:36.400]   And if I could perform miracles, and let's say one of you guys called me saying, "Pastor
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:41.400]   Peter, one of my family members is sick at the hospital, maybe it's a terminal disease,
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:43.520]   can you come and pray?"
[00:11:43.520 --> 00:11:48.520]   And I go to that hospital, I lay my hands on that person, I pray in the name of Jesus,
[00:11:48.520 --> 00:11:51.960]   that person is healed fully.
[00:11:51.960 --> 00:11:59.080]   You guys would probably be amazed and stunned and likely attribute this healing to the supernatural
[00:11:59.080 --> 00:12:02.760]   power of God working through me.
[00:12:02.760 --> 00:12:06.960]   After all, why would God give such a beautiful and wonderful gift to an enemy of the cross
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:08.720]   of Christ?
[00:12:08.720 --> 00:12:15.520]   Now if I were to be able to perform many miracles like this, and you could validate these miracles
[00:12:15.520 --> 00:12:22.760]   to be authentic, and you could see that I have this kind of power, you likely will swallow
[00:12:22.760 --> 00:12:27.040]   up everything that I tell you.
[00:12:27.040 --> 00:12:32.400]   You may treat me like a celebrity, you may treat me like a spiritual guru, why?
[00:12:32.400 --> 00:12:36.960]   Because that's a very natural reaction to the supernatural.
[00:12:36.960 --> 00:12:45.160]   So we are naturally reverent toward those who we are amazed by.
[00:12:45.160 --> 00:12:49.160]   The interesting thing is, Jesus does not say to this group, "No, you didn't do those things."
[00:12:49.160 --> 00:12:52.080]   "Lord, Lord, did we not?"
[00:12:52.080 --> 00:12:56.000]   Jesus doesn't say, "No, you didn't, you're mistaking."
[00:12:56.000 --> 00:12:58.960]   He simply makes a declaration of condemnation.
[00:12:58.960 --> 00:13:07.440]   "I never knew you, depart from me, you who practice lawlessness."
[00:13:07.440 --> 00:13:12.040]   For me, Matthew 7, 21 to 23 is actually the scariest passages, is one of the scariest
[00:13:12.040 --> 00:13:15.400]   passages in all scripture.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:17.120]   Why?
[00:13:17.120 --> 00:13:22.560]   It's because I'm not 100% convinced that I am not a false prophet.
[00:13:22.560 --> 00:13:30.400]   I am hoping with all my heart that I am not one, but I am not 100% convinced.
[00:13:30.400 --> 00:13:34.640]   So when I look at my life, and when I look at my heart, there are too many blemishes,
[00:13:34.640 --> 00:13:39.800]   too many bad fruits in my flesh, I am rotten to the core, which you guys probably already
[00:13:39.800 --> 00:13:42.640]   have known.
[00:13:42.640 --> 00:13:48.080]   So I don't trust me enough to be able to say, "Oh, for sure, absolutely, I'm not a false
[00:13:48.080 --> 00:13:50.000]   prophet."
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:56.440]   As it reads in 2 Timothy 3, 13, false prophets who hold to a form of godliness, as it says
[00:13:56.440 --> 00:14:02.400]   in verse 5, they themselves are deceived, so that they do not know that they are false
[00:14:02.400 --> 00:14:05.000]   prophets.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:10.920]   So it is possible that most false prophets are not aware that they are false prophets.
[00:14:10.920 --> 00:14:16.600]   So are there false prophets and folks on the broad and the wide who have orthodox theology?
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:18.240]   Yes.
[00:14:18.240 --> 00:14:23.080]   Are there false prophets and folks on the broad and the wide who profess Jesus Christ
[00:14:23.080 --> 00:14:26.600]   to be the only way and the truth and the life?
[00:14:26.600 --> 00:14:27.960]   Yes.
[00:14:27.960 --> 00:14:33.800]   Are there false prophets and folks on the broad and the wide who have supernatural power?
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:35.120]   Yes.
[00:14:35.120 --> 00:14:38.440]   Scary stuff.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:42.880]   If someone were to ask you how you know with absolute certainty that you are truly a believing
[00:14:42.880 --> 00:14:50.760]   child of God, you will likely come up with some kind of theologically sound verbal answer,
[00:14:50.760 --> 00:14:55.720]   and then in your mind, you will probably try to kind of validate those things by listing
[00:14:55.720 --> 00:14:58.540]   out your Christian resume.
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.720]   And sometimes we seek reassurance by the Christian activities and experiences in our lives, so
[00:15:03.720 --> 00:15:08.440]   what is on your Christian resume that you try and find reassurance in or others may
[00:15:08.440 --> 00:15:11.080]   look at and pat you on the back for?
[00:15:11.080 --> 00:15:12.720]   Was it baptism?
[00:15:12.720 --> 00:15:14.400]   Was it mission trips?
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.200]   What are those things?
[00:15:16.200 --> 00:15:21.080]   I have a few, and allow me to share with you some of mine, okay?
[00:15:21.080 --> 00:15:26.840]   First, I've been a pastor for over 19 years, and objectively, I've forsaken comforts and
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:28.800]   served as a missionary to China.
[00:15:28.800 --> 00:15:31.120]   We've immigrated again to Korea, and now we came back.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:34.880]   I've forsaken these things.
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:37.440]   I am not a health and wealth gospel teacher.
[00:15:37.440 --> 00:15:41.480]   Although, I would not be on this pulpit if I were.
[00:15:41.480 --> 00:15:48.800]   My teaching and preaching, people have said, is mostly in line with Orthodox Christianity.
[00:15:48.800 --> 00:15:53.000]   I've traveled to many parts of the world visiting orphans and widows, probably more than you
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:57.600]   guys have and probably more than you guys ever will for the most of you.
[00:15:57.600 --> 00:16:02.320]   And after all, isn't visiting orphans and widows in their helplessness something that
[00:16:02.320 --> 00:16:05.200]   our God and Father consider as pure and undefiled religion?
[00:16:05.200 --> 00:16:08.280]   I've done that.
[00:16:08.280 --> 00:16:13.960]   I've preached Orthodox biblical truth and dispensed Bible information in many different
[00:16:13.960 --> 00:16:19.480]   cultural contexts, and I actually can say I put myself in harm's way for the ministry
[00:16:19.480 --> 00:16:20.480]   of the gospel.
[00:16:20.480 --> 00:16:25.840]   I've traveled in North Korea more than I have in the South, and I could have lost freedom
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:26.840]   from that.
[00:16:26.840 --> 00:16:32.520]   So, I've done that, and I've led many of you in here in Bible study, in discipleship.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:37.920]   So, I've done all these things, but none of these things guarantee that I'm not a false
[00:16:37.920 --> 00:16:41.480]   prophet.
[00:16:41.480 --> 00:16:45.360]   None of these things guarantee that I am on the small and the narrow.
[00:16:45.360 --> 00:16:49.640]   I may have a form of godliness, but is this truly good fruit in my life?
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.800]   Is there genuine fruit-bearing spirit power?
[00:16:51.800 --> 00:16:58.520]   So, like I said, I am not 100% convinced that I am not a false prophet.
[00:16:58.520 --> 00:17:00.320]   I'm hoping that I'm not.
[00:17:00.320 --> 00:17:08.240]   I'm trusting that I'm not, but that's where I stand because I refuse to put 100% of my
[00:17:08.240 --> 00:17:12.480]   trust in any human being, especially myself.
[00:17:12.480 --> 00:17:14.760]   So, how about for you?
[00:17:14.760 --> 00:17:19.600]   What are the things that you might say, "Lord, Lord, did I not," and then you fill in the
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:20.600]   blank?
[00:17:20.600 --> 00:17:24.080]   "Lord, in your name, did I not do these things?"
[00:17:24.080 --> 00:17:27.860]   What are the things that you can state and claim?
[00:17:27.860 --> 00:17:31.560]   If you guys have been studying with us through the book of Philippians, you know that all
[00:17:31.560 --> 00:17:38.320]   of these things that I just listed, it's scabalon, excrement, rubbish in the sight of a holy,
[00:17:38.320 --> 00:17:39.500]   holy, holy God.
[00:17:39.500 --> 00:17:44.240]   These things do not guarantee entrance through the small and the narrow.
[00:17:44.240 --> 00:17:50.000]   So, Jesus says, "There's a wide and a broad, many enter through it, it leads to destruction.
[00:17:50.000 --> 00:17:53.480]   Small and the narrow leads to life, only a few find it.
[00:17:53.480 --> 00:17:57.360]   There are false prophets, you can distinguish them by their fruits.
[00:17:57.360 --> 00:18:01.920]   But many of these guys are so deceived, they get to judgment and they think they're on
[00:18:01.920 --> 00:18:03.760]   the proper road and they're not."
[00:18:03.760 --> 00:18:10.320]   So, let me ask you guys, you will know them by their fruit sounds easy enough, but is
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.800]   it that easy?
[00:18:14.800 --> 00:18:18.520]   How do I discern which road I am on?
[00:18:18.520 --> 00:18:23.640]   How do I discern who's teaching me truth, who's feeding me lies?
[00:18:23.640 --> 00:18:31.400]   Matthew chapter 7 verse 24, "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on
[00:18:31.400 --> 00:18:37.120]   them may be compared to a wise man who had built his house on the rock."
[00:18:37.120 --> 00:18:39.920]   So verse 24 starts with a therefore, okay?
[00:18:39.920 --> 00:18:44.460]   And as we have learned, wherever there is a therefore, you have to ask yourself, what?
[00:18:44.460 --> 00:18:46.800]   What is the therefore therefore?
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:55.840]   So there has been a very heavy exhortation from Christ and the therefore, there's an
[00:18:55.840 --> 00:18:58.520]   expectation of a proper application.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.800]   Therefore is a very important word in every language and in English, therefore connects
[00:19:03.800 --> 00:19:11.800]   what was previously just said about all of this stuff to what the application is.
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:19.280]   "Therefore, everyone who hears these words of mine and acts on them may be compared to
[00:19:19.280 --> 00:19:22.620]   a wise man who built his house on the rock.
[00:19:22.620 --> 00:19:27.280]   And the rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and slammed against that house,
[00:19:27.280 --> 00:19:31.360]   and yet it did not fall, for it had been founded on the rock.
[00:19:31.360 --> 00:19:35.180]   Everyone who hears these words of mine and does not act on them will be like a foolish
[00:19:35.180 --> 00:19:37.320]   man who built his house on the sand.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.720]   The rain fell and the floods came and the winds blew and slammed against that house
[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.440]   and it fell and great was its fall."
[00:19:44.440 --> 00:19:48.720]   So Jesus describes a man building on the solid foundation of a rock.
[00:19:48.720 --> 00:19:53.400]   This man and the few who are on the small and the narrow are one and the same, okay?
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:57.000]   Jesus also describes a man building on the sand.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:01.800]   This man and the many who are on the broad and the wide are also one and the same.
[00:20:01.800 --> 00:20:04.240]   Rain comes on both in judgment, okay?
[00:20:04.240 --> 00:20:07.280]   Or you could say the torrent, the flood, it comes.
[00:20:07.280 --> 00:20:12.960]   But the house that stands the test is built by the man who, one, hears the whole counsel
[00:20:12.960 --> 00:20:17.360]   of God, and two, acts on the whole counsel of God.
[00:20:17.360 --> 00:20:21.840]   ESV says, "Does the whole counsel of God," and IV says, "Puts it into practice."
[00:20:21.840 --> 00:20:28.440]   But the idea is hears the word of God and does the word of God is the person who's building
[00:20:28.440 --> 00:20:30.700]   on the rock.
[00:20:30.700 --> 00:20:41.520]   And here at Berean, our goal is for you to be on the small and the narrow.
[00:20:41.520 --> 00:20:45.760]   Our desire is for all of us to be on this small and the narrow and we want to equip
[00:20:45.760 --> 00:20:50.360]   you to bring others also onto this small and the narrow.
[00:20:50.360 --> 00:20:57.560]   And according to Jesus, the way you do this is through the dispensation of his word.
[00:20:57.560 --> 00:21:00.760]   What are Jesus' last words to the apostles who will build this church?
[00:21:00.760 --> 00:21:03.040]   Matthew 28, 18 to 20.
[00:21:03.040 --> 00:21:08.720]   And Jesus came up and spoke to them saying, "All authority has been given to me in heaven
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:10.600]   on earth.
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:15.120]   Go therefore and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name of the Father and
[00:21:15.120 --> 00:21:21.080]   of the Son and the Holy Spirit, teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you.
[00:21:21.080 --> 00:21:25.760]   And lo, I am with you always, even to the end of the age."
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:31.200]   If you look through the scriptures, parable after parable especially, for example, Mark
[00:21:31.200 --> 00:21:36.640]   chapter 4, the parable of the sower, the thing that bears enduring, lasting, persevering
[00:21:36.640 --> 00:21:39.900]   fruit is always the word of God.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:46.760]   So the church's main responsibility is not to make you feel loved or inspire you to be
[00:21:46.760 --> 00:21:51.320]   a more moral person or to become a better you or to become a good leader.
[00:21:51.320 --> 00:21:53.640]   That's not the job of the church.
[00:21:53.640 --> 00:21:59.140]   The job of the church is not to surround you with good friends or to make you feel welcome
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:03.080]   or to entertain you.
[00:22:03.080 --> 00:22:10.160]   These are not bad things, but by doing these things, we might actually mislead you or give
[00:22:10.160 --> 00:22:17.240]   you a false assurance of your salvation without even knowing that we're doing that.
[00:22:17.240 --> 00:22:22.920]   The church's main responsibility is to restore you to the King of kings and the Lord of lords.
[00:22:22.920 --> 00:22:32.320]   The church's main responsibility is to disciple you and make you a worshiper of Jesus Christ.
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:38.920]   And Jesus says the church is to do that not only by teaching you all that he has said,
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:43.560]   but also to lead you in doing all that he has said.
[00:22:43.560 --> 00:22:46.400]   So I'm going to turn your attention back to covenant number two.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:52.780]   It says, "I confess that the Bible is the inerrant word of God, which has ultimate authority
[00:22:52.780 --> 00:22:54.800]   over my life."
[00:22:54.800 --> 00:22:59.240]   So for you guys who are members, if you sign this as a member, this is what you are agreeing
[00:22:59.240 --> 00:23:00.240]   to, okay?
[00:23:00.240 --> 00:23:02.920]   This is what you've signed.
[00:23:02.920 --> 00:23:07.280]   My standard is not the culture.
[00:23:07.280 --> 00:23:13.800]   Our standard is not church people's expectations or even Berean leaders' expectations.
[00:23:13.800 --> 00:23:19.000]   Our standard is not the ever-changing trends of our modern age.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.120]   Our standard is not policy or political affiliation.
[00:23:23.120 --> 00:23:28.400]   Our standard is not what the world thinks Christians ought to look like.
[00:23:28.400 --> 00:23:33.800]   Our standard is not the person next to me or the person in front of me.
[00:23:33.800 --> 00:23:41.480]   Our standard, which is ultimate authority over our lives, is the word of God.
[00:23:41.480 --> 00:23:46.380]   And the word of God alone has ultimate authority for your life.
[00:23:46.380 --> 00:23:52.360]   I confess that the Bible is the inerrant word of God, which has ultimate authority over
[00:23:52.360 --> 00:23:54.800]   my life.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:23:56.720]   So that first part, you might get tripped up.
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:59.520]   Well, inerrant word of God, okay?
[00:23:59.520 --> 00:24:02.560]   And let me explain briefly to you what this is.
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:07.320]   I'm not going to be able to go into this so much in detail, but I do want to talk about
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:08.320]   this a little bit.
[00:24:08.320 --> 00:24:15.180]   2 Peter 1.21, "But know this first of all, that no prophecy of Scripture is a matter
[00:24:15.180 --> 00:24:17.720]   of one's own interpretation.
[00:24:17.720 --> 00:24:24.000]   For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:25.400]   spoke from God."
[00:24:25.400 --> 00:24:31.920]   2 Timothy 3.16-17, "All Scripture is inspired by God and profitable for teaching, for reproof,
[00:24:31.920 --> 00:24:38.880]   for correction, for training in righteousness, so that the man of God may be adequately equipped
[00:24:38.880 --> 00:24:39.880]   for every good work."
[00:24:40.580 --> 00:24:48.340]   There are passages in the Scriptures like this that tell us that we have what God intended
[00:24:48.340 --> 00:24:49.340]   us to have.
[00:24:49.340 --> 00:24:51.580]   Does that make sense?
[00:24:51.580 --> 00:24:58.000]   We have what God wanted us to have in His Word, okay?
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:00.880]   So what is inerrancy?
[00:25:00.880 --> 00:25:01.880]   What is inerrancy?
[00:25:01.880 --> 00:25:07.640]   Wayne Grudem, a theologian most of you guys are familiar with, defines it this way.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:14.660]   The inerrancy of Scripture means that Scripture in the original manuscripts does not affirm
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.960]   anything contrary to fact.
[00:25:17.960 --> 00:25:20.380]   So it's absolute truth.
[00:25:20.380 --> 00:25:24.780]   And this is what the Webster's Dictionary defines as inerrancy.
[00:25:24.780 --> 00:25:30.200]   The belief that the Bible is free from error in matters of science as well as those of
[00:25:30.200 --> 00:25:32.280]   faith.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:42.080]   So basically, the Bible as we have it is God's Word as He would have us have it.
[00:25:42.080 --> 00:25:44.980]   You guys follow me?
[00:25:44.980 --> 00:25:53.280]   The Word of God, the Bible, is God's Word as He would have us have it.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:55.840]   So this is God's Word.
[00:25:55.840 --> 00:25:59.420]   And this is what every single one of our leaders believes.
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:04.720]   This is the formal stance of our church, and that is why we study the Word of God as passionately
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:07.740]   as we do.
[00:26:07.740 --> 00:26:13.720]   What I've noticed in my near two decades of ministry, it's not a long time but it's enough,
[00:26:13.720 --> 00:26:20.360]   is that people who have a trouble with inerrancy ultimately have an issue with the Bible's
[00:26:20.360 --> 00:26:25.400]   authority over their lives.
[00:26:25.400 --> 00:26:32.440]   People who wrestle with inerrancy ultimately don't want God's Word to be God's Word.
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:38.100]   And though they may spend hours reading about the Bible, about textual criticism, canonicity
[00:26:38.100 --> 00:26:45.320]   of Scripture, they don't actually spend a lot of time studying the Bible themselves.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:50.680]   Because if I can poke holes in the Bible and to say that it's not God's Word, I have some
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:55.200]   wiggle room and I ultimately don't need to submit to it.
[00:26:55.200 --> 00:27:00.520]   And in almost 100% of the cases, and this is again, personal subjective experience from
[00:27:00.520 --> 00:27:02.280]   someone who's potentially a false prophet, okay?
[00:27:02.280 --> 00:27:06.000]   So take it however you will.
[00:27:06.000 --> 00:27:16.240]   But in my flawed subjective experience, almost 100% of the cases, liberal theology leads
[00:27:16.240 --> 00:27:19.400]   to liberal morality.
[00:27:19.400 --> 00:27:22.280]   Liberal theology leads to liberal morality.
[00:27:22.280 --> 00:27:30.040]   And rejection of the Bible as the inerrant Word of God never leads to freedom.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:35.160]   In fact, I've seen it lead to more bondage.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:40.960]   Liberal theology always leads to liberal living.
[00:27:40.960 --> 00:27:49.680]   Liberal theology leads to a rejection of truth, a rejection of God, and a rejection of the
[00:27:49.680 --> 00:27:52.520]   pursuit of holiness.
[00:27:52.520 --> 00:27:58.800]   And if someone's mind is made up, you can't convince them otherwise.
[00:27:58.800 --> 00:28:05.280]   And the sad thing is that this is often done in the name of truth, in the name of God,
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:07.160]   in the name of a pursuit for righteousness.
[00:28:07.160 --> 00:28:08.720]   I really want to know the truth.
[00:28:08.720 --> 00:28:12.280]   Well, really.
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:17.840]   Wolves like to dress themselves in sheep's clothing so much so that eventually, wolves
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:22.800]   often convince themselves that they are sheep and not wolves.
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.920]   So you have to be careful.
[00:28:24.920 --> 00:28:31.000]   The Apostle Paul says something similar in 1 Corinthians 14, 37 to 38.
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:34.760]   If anyone thinks he's a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize that the things which I
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:37.360]   write to you are the Lord's commandment.
[00:28:37.360 --> 00:28:42.000]   But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:45.640]   So basically, what Paul is saying is you reject the authority of the Word of God, the author
[00:28:45.640 --> 00:28:49.280]   of the Word of God rejects you.
[00:28:49.280 --> 00:28:54.560]   If you, in your arrogance, reject the authority of the Word of God, the author of life himself
[00:28:54.560 --> 00:28:57.600]   will reject you.
[00:28:57.600 --> 00:29:00.200]   And actually, it's not more of a you do this and he'll do that.
[00:29:00.200 --> 00:29:01.520]   It's actually a condition of the heart.
[00:29:01.520 --> 00:29:02.520]   You've already been rejected.
[00:29:02.520 --> 00:29:07.040]   And so, the natural byproduct is you say, "Well, forget the Word of God.
[00:29:07.040 --> 00:29:08.320]   I am my Lord."
[00:29:08.320 --> 00:29:12.760]   And that happens almost every single time.
[00:29:12.760 --> 00:29:18.560]   Now, proper doctrine and belief in the inerrancy of Scripture, it does not automatically equate
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:22.000]   with appropriate living.
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:26.880]   But trust me, lawlessness, the potential false prophet, okay?
[00:29:26.880 --> 00:29:32.040]   Lawlessness always accompanies a rejection of the authority of Scripture.
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:42.760]   And rejection of the inerrancy of God usually leads to rejecting all things that are good.
[00:29:42.760 --> 00:29:46.960]   So why do I believe that the Word of God is truth?
[00:29:46.960 --> 00:29:51.200]   Objectively, I believe it can't be conspired by man.
[00:29:51.200 --> 00:29:58.480]   40 different authors, including prophets and kings and a shepherd, carpenter, musicians,
[00:29:58.480 --> 00:30:05.280]   learned men, unlearned men, educated and trained men, unskilled and mumbling men, they wrote
[00:30:05.280 --> 00:30:06.280]   the Word of God.
[00:30:06.280 --> 00:30:13.600]   40 different authors, three languages, different contexts, different cultures, different countries
[00:30:13.600 --> 00:30:17.220]   even with one message.
[00:30:17.220 --> 00:30:18.400]   God is God.
[00:30:18.400 --> 00:30:19.400]   We are not.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:26.520]   And he sent his son or he will send his son to deliver us from our sin and restore proper
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:28.320]   worship back to the creator.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.080]   That's the consistent message throughout the Scripture.
[00:30:30.080 --> 00:30:32.640]   So objectively, man cannot have made this up.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:37.520]   Secondly, everything I know to be good and true and moral and upright and kind and compassionate,
[00:30:37.520 --> 00:30:41.440]   I found in Scripture.
[00:30:41.440 --> 00:30:46.160]   And everything that this world says is really noble and honorable, all of that is found
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.640]   in Scripture.
[00:30:49.640 --> 00:30:54.000]   And subjectively, I will share, the Word of God has absolutely and radically changed my
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:56.080]   life.
[00:30:56.080 --> 00:31:01.560]   I was a very lost, very angry, very selfish, insecure, confused young man.
[00:31:01.560 --> 00:31:03.840]   I had addictions, I had idols, I had major issues.
[00:31:03.840 --> 00:31:09.720]   And unfortunately, I brought them into the pastoral in my first few years of ministry.
[00:31:09.720 --> 00:31:13.720]   So actually, there are some of my former students who are now here in their 30s who are in that
[00:31:13.720 --> 00:31:25.560]   original youth group, asked them, "I was pretty messed up, but God has changed my life."
[00:31:25.560 --> 00:31:28.720]   Through His Word.
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.360]   The delight in the Word of God, the commitment to study it, to memorize it, and to share
[00:31:32.360 --> 00:31:39.400]   it has absolutely changed everything about me.
[00:31:39.400 --> 00:31:43.160]   So I believe in the sufficiency of Scriptures, not only for the objective reasons, but also
[00:31:43.160 --> 00:31:46.200]   for subjective impact it has had on my life.
[00:31:46.200 --> 00:31:47.880]   And I want to exhort you to do the same.
[00:31:47.880 --> 00:31:50.120]   Taste and see that the Lord is good.
[00:31:50.120 --> 00:31:51.880]   Trust in the Lord with all your heart.
[00:31:51.880 --> 00:31:54.520]   Lean not on your own understanding, but in all your ways, acknowledge Him.
[00:31:54.520 --> 00:31:56.040]   He will make your path straight.
[00:31:56.040 --> 00:32:01.400]   I want to exhort you to love the Word of God because that is the lamp unto your feet and
[00:32:01.400 --> 00:32:03.800]   the light unto your path.
[00:32:03.800 --> 00:32:05.640]   That is the heartbeat of every leader.
[00:32:05.640 --> 00:32:10.600]   We want to point you to Christ through His Word.
[00:32:10.600 --> 00:32:15.480]   Covenant number five reads, "I commit to attending and preparing for weekday Bible
[00:32:15.480 --> 00:32:20.600]   studies every week to the best of my ability."
[00:32:20.600 --> 00:32:24.760]   Now because we believe that the Word of God has ultimate authority over our lives, the
[00:32:24.760 --> 00:32:32.360]   main responsibility of our church is to direct you to learn, to love, and to live out His
[00:32:32.360 --> 00:32:33.360]   Word.
[00:32:33.360 --> 00:32:34.360]   Amen?
[00:32:34.360 --> 00:32:36.880]   That's our job.
[00:32:36.880 --> 00:32:41.760]   John 14, 15, Jesus says, "If you love me, you will obey my commandments."
[00:32:41.760 --> 00:32:49.400]   We want to teach you and we also want to learn how to love our God the way He desires to
[00:32:49.400 --> 00:32:52.120]   be loved and worshipped.
[00:32:52.120 --> 00:32:55.520]   He is the standard.
[00:32:55.520 --> 00:33:01.000]   And if you notice, our church doesn't have too many programs, right?
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:06.880]   To the complaint and derision of some, "We don't have many programs."
[00:33:06.880 --> 00:33:11.360]   And when we do have a program, there's a Bible study in it, right?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.000]   But why do we do it this way?
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.880]   Because growing together in the knowledge and the practice of His Word is non-negotiable.
[00:33:18.880 --> 00:33:20.080]   That is a priority.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:22.240]   That's absolutely essential.
[00:33:22.240 --> 00:33:27.760]   Everything else are good benefits that come with that, but the central thing is our fellowship
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:31.800]   has to be founded upon the Scriptures.
[00:33:31.800 --> 00:33:36.960]   And our covenant number five, our Bible study, is actually the very bare minimum for your
[00:33:36.960 --> 00:33:37.960]   good.
[00:33:37.960 --> 00:33:40.520]   Let me say this again.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:44.640]   Our Bible study is the bare minimum.
[00:33:44.640 --> 00:33:48.720]   That's the basic and fundamental.
[00:33:48.720 --> 00:33:51.800]   Bible study is not the goal.
[00:33:51.800 --> 00:33:54.520]   That's one of our starting points.
[00:33:54.520 --> 00:34:02.520]   And it's sometimes so disheartening that so many of you here struggle to keep up, struggle
[00:34:02.520 --> 00:34:05.800]   with what should be just the bare minimum.
[00:34:05.800 --> 00:34:06.800]   It's cumbersome.
[00:34:06.800 --> 00:34:07.800]   I'm busy.
[00:34:07.800 --> 00:34:14.400]   And you struggle to just prepare for something so basic, which is just an hour and a half,
[00:34:14.400 --> 00:34:17.280]   two hours a week.
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:18.680]   Why is this covenant so important?
[00:34:18.680 --> 00:34:21.560]   Why is number five so important?
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:28.600]   Our worship must be fueled by a proper understanding of the whole counsel of God.
[00:34:28.600 --> 00:34:32.840]   Our worship must be fueled by a proper understanding of the whole counsel of God.
[00:34:32.840 --> 00:34:35.840]   Our personal worship has to be fueled by a proper understanding of the whole counsel
[00:34:35.840 --> 00:34:36.840]   of God.
[00:34:36.840 --> 00:34:40.560]   When life is good and things are comfortable, we have to be reminded that this is not our
[00:34:40.560 --> 00:34:41.560]   home.
[00:34:41.560 --> 00:34:45.240]   We have to be reminded that we are to love the Creator, not the creation.
[00:34:45.240 --> 00:34:49.800]   We need to be reminded that the things of this world are passing away, that our treasures
[00:34:49.800 --> 00:34:51.400]   have to be stored up in heaven.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:54.320]   Those are the things that we need to be reminded of when things are good and comfortable and
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:55.320]   easy.
[00:34:55.320 --> 00:34:58.760]   But when life is hard, and some of your lives are very hard, we need to be reminded that
[00:34:58.760 --> 00:35:03.400]   God is in control, that He is love, that He is good, He doesn't make a single mistake,
[00:35:03.400 --> 00:35:11.240]   that He has ordained all things for your good is what we need to be reminded of.
[00:35:11.240 --> 00:35:18.680]   Our personal worship has to be founded on truth, because He is looking for those who
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:24.680]   will worship not just in spirit, but also in truth.
[00:35:24.680 --> 00:35:26.640]   Our personal worship has to be fueled by Scripture.
[00:35:26.640 --> 00:35:31.120]   Our corporate worship must be fueled by Scripture.
[00:35:31.120 --> 00:35:33.760]   The way we do church has to be biblical.
[00:35:33.760 --> 00:35:36.280]   We need to test everything.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:40.680]   So 1 Thessalonians 5, 16 to 22, this is, you want to discern and know and test God's will
[00:35:40.680 --> 00:35:41.680]   for your life?
[00:35:41.680 --> 00:35:42.680]   Here it is.
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:48.680]   Rejoice always, pray without ceasing, and everything give thanks, for this is God's
[00:35:48.680 --> 00:35:50.920]   will for you in Christ Jesus.
[00:35:50.920 --> 00:35:57.640]   Do not quench the spirit, do not despise prophetic utterances, but examine everything carefully.
[00:35:57.640 --> 00:36:02.040]   Hold fast to which is good, abstain from every form of evil.
[00:36:02.040 --> 00:36:07.400]   One of the negatives about a typical Bible church is a lot of times they reject all things
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.400]   charismatic.
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:14.840]   And I'm not saying that that's of our church, but a lot of times Bible churches that are
[00:36:14.840 --> 00:36:20.880]   very conservative do reject things of more spiritual in nature, but here it says, do
[00:36:20.880 --> 00:36:26.880]   not quench the spirit, do not despise prophetic utterances, examine everything carefully,
[00:36:26.880 --> 00:36:29.480]   hold fast to what is good, abstain from every form of evil.
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:34.320]   So I can't just reject stuff like that, but I will test it by the Word of God.
[00:36:34.320 --> 00:36:38.040]   So what do we think about charismatic gifts?
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:43.680]   Don't believe what the church stands on, you search the scriptures for yourself.
[00:36:43.680 --> 00:36:45.480]   What do you think about charismatic gifts?
[00:36:45.480 --> 00:36:47.320]   Why do we baptize people the way we do?
[00:36:47.320 --> 00:36:48.960]   What is our perspective on financial giving?
[00:36:48.960 --> 00:36:51.080]   Should we even call it tithing?
[00:36:51.080 --> 00:36:54.080]   What are all of these things based on?
[00:36:54.080 --> 00:36:57.320]   And how do the leaders shepherd the flock of God?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:00.760]   What are you to expect from the leaders in their shepherding of the flock of God?
[00:37:00.760 --> 00:37:06.120]   And how are you supposed to pray for and submit to the leadership of the church according
[00:37:06.120 --> 00:37:08.800]   to the Word of God?
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:15.080]   Our worship must be fueled by a proper understanding of the whole counsel of God.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:18.680]   Second, our fellowship must be fueled by a proper understanding of the whole counsel
[00:37:18.680 --> 00:37:19.680]   of God.
[00:37:19.680 --> 00:37:23.480]   John 17, 17, "Sanctify them by the truth, your word is truth."
[00:37:23.480 --> 00:37:28.240]   Jesus is praying on the path of all the saints to come and in their relationship with one
[00:37:28.240 --> 00:37:33.120]   another and he says, "Sanctify them in your truth, your word is truth."
[00:37:33.120 --> 00:37:38.840]   The Word of God will impact positively or negatively your relationship and it's supposed
[00:37:38.840 --> 00:37:41.140]   to sanctify your friendships.
[00:37:41.140 --> 00:37:46.240]   So our fellowship must be fueled not by personality, what do you call it?
[00:37:46.240 --> 00:37:50.900]   I'm at a loss of words, I'm talking too fast.
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:52.760]   Personality like attractions.
[00:37:52.760 --> 00:38:00.760]   Our fellowship must first and foremost be founded upon our understanding of his Word.
[00:38:00.760 --> 00:38:07.280]   Our evangelism and our engagement in the Great Commission must be fueled by the Word.
[00:38:07.280 --> 00:38:12.600]   Learning and teaching to do everything that God has taught.
[00:38:12.600 --> 00:38:18.920]   John 10, 16 says, "I have other sheep which are not of this fold, I must bring them also
[00:38:18.920 --> 00:38:24.240]   and they will hear my voice and they will become one flock with one shepherd."
[00:38:24.240 --> 00:38:27.900]   So Jesus has other sheep, they will hear his voice.
[00:38:27.900 --> 00:38:33.660]   We have to make sure that when we are trying to lead his sheep to the shepherd that they
[00:38:33.660 --> 00:38:39.040]   are hearing his voice correctly and not our opinion.
[00:38:39.040 --> 00:38:45.040]   When we are evangelizing our unbelieving family and friends, we have to make sure we're not
[00:38:45.040 --> 00:38:47.360]   getting in the way.
[00:38:47.360 --> 00:38:50.920]   First Timothy 4, 16, "Pay close attention to yourself."
[00:38:50.920 --> 00:38:55.360]   And this isn't an endorsement on like self-worship, this means scrutinize your living, okay?
[00:38:55.360 --> 00:39:00.360]   Pay close attention to yourself and to your teaching, persevere in these things for as
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:07.760]   you do this, you will ensure salvation both for yourself and for those who hear you.
[00:39:07.760 --> 00:39:11.520]   We need to be reminded that we need to persevere in scrutinizing both our doctrine and our
[00:39:11.520 --> 00:39:12.520]   lifestyle.
[00:39:12.520 --> 00:39:13.520]   Why?
[00:39:13.520 --> 00:39:22.160]   So that we don't become a stumbling block to those who we're trying to reach and save.
[00:39:22.160 --> 00:39:24.880]   Being a member at Berlin Community Church is not enough.
[00:39:24.880 --> 00:39:28.040]   Being a member at a Bible church is not enough.
[00:39:28.040 --> 00:39:36.120]   Being at a Bible church hearing sound teaching is not enough.
[00:39:36.120 --> 00:39:40.760]   You being at this church and not engaging in the scriptures is like going to the gym
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.200]   and watching people work out.
[00:39:43.200 --> 00:39:45.520]   It does very little for your body.
[00:39:45.520 --> 00:39:47.560]   It actually causes jealousy if anything, right?
[00:39:47.560 --> 00:39:49.080]   It's like, "Man, he's ripped."
[00:39:49.080 --> 00:39:50.080]   Right?
[00:39:50.080 --> 00:39:52.460]   That's what happens.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.820]   Being at a Bible church and not engaging in the study of the word is like you just going
[00:39:57.820 --> 00:40:04.360]   to the gym, paying money, and then popping out.
[00:40:04.360 --> 00:40:09.220]   Covenant number five is not something that we aspire to.
[00:40:09.220 --> 00:40:13.800]   It's the bare minimum for your well-being as a church member.
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:18.300]   Now in our house, in our home, I have a twin son and daughter.
[00:40:18.300 --> 00:40:19.580]   They're four and a half.
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:23.300]   In our home, we have dining rules.
[00:40:23.300 --> 00:40:28.180]   They're not like set in stone, but these are our table manners, eating rules.
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:33.340]   It's such a struggle to get four and a half year olds to eat.
[00:40:33.340 --> 00:40:34.340]   Anybody familiar with this?
[00:40:34.340 --> 00:40:36.940]   It is really difficult.
[00:40:36.940 --> 00:40:38.440]   You may have similar rules at your home.
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:42.020]   Number one rule, we wash our hands before we eat.
[00:40:42.020 --> 00:40:43.020]   Good or bad?
[00:40:43.020 --> 00:40:45.140]   It's very good.
[00:40:45.140 --> 00:40:46.480]   Number two, good dad, right?
[00:40:46.480 --> 00:40:50.440]   Number two, we pray and give thanks to God before we eat.
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:55.240]   Now they pray, they're just saying words at this point, and they say random stuff, right?
[00:40:55.240 --> 00:40:58.840]   They talk about bunny rabbits and stuff in their meal prayer, but we want to get them
[00:40:58.840 --> 00:41:01.640]   in the habit of thanking the Lord, so that's rule number two.
[00:41:01.640 --> 00:41:06.160]   Number three, we do not throw our food or play with our food.
[00:41:06.160 --> 00:41:08.640]   They used to do this, and they got in trouble for this a lot.
[00:41:08.640 --> 00:41:12.640]   They probably don't remember, but that was a rule that we established, and we disciplined
[00:41:12.640 --> 00:41:15.360]   them for it, for throwing food.
[00:41:15.360 --> 00:41:16.360]   They always throw the meat.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:17.360]   They don't throw the pasta.
[00:41:17.360 --> 00:41:19.280]   I'm like, "I could have eaten that."
[00:41:19.280 --> 00:41:21.920]   They're throwing away the food, and that is something we don't do, right?
[00:41:21.920 --> 00:41:27.280]   Because it's wasteful, and that's just not acceptable in society.
[00:41:27.280 --> 00:41:29.880]   Fourth, we don't have toys at our table.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:30.880]   Why?
[00:41:30.880 --> 00:41:33.240]   Because they get distracted, right?
[00:41:33.240 --> 00:41:34.960]   It's not that we don't want them to play with toys.
[00:41:34.960 --> 00:41:37.960]   It's just at mealtime, focus on the food.
[00:41:37.960 --> 00:41:42.400]   And fifth, we're to have both butt cheeks on the chair when we eat.
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:45.940]   You may have never heard the word butt cheek in a sermon, but here it is.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:49.560]   You need to have both buns on the chair because they keep getting up.
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:50.560]   They get off.
[00:41:50.560 --> 00:41:53.520]   They wander around, and it's like, "Get back on there."
[00:41:53.520 --> 00:41:57.400]   That's a rule that we almost always have to remind them of, and sometimes have to put
[00:41:57.400 --> 00:42:01.240]   them on timeout enough, or timeout for.
[00:42:01.240 --> 00:42:02.640]   Why do we have rules at our table?
[00:42:02.640 --> 00:42:08.400]   Ultimately, the rules are there to ensure our kids properly eat.
[00:42:08.400 --> 00:42:14.960]   I don't care if they play with a toy or if they get up off the chair.
[00:42:14.960 --> 00:42:18.740]   Them staying on the chair is not my desire for them.
[00:42:18.740 --> 00:42:22.620]   My desire for them is to eat, ultimately to grow.
[00:42:22.620 --> 00:42:26.740]   These house rules are not there for them to become good house rule keepers.
[00:42:26.740 --> 00:42:30.700]   They're there for them to eat, for them to grow.
[00:42:30.700 --> 00:42:35.980]   And I'm hoping that none of you are judging me as a bad parent for having these rules.
[00:42:35.980 --> 00:42:37.420]   So why do we have covenant number five?
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:43.940]   It's to make sure that our members at our church are eating.
[00:42:43.940 --> 00:42:48.920]   And as I have said before, weekday Bible study is the bare minimum when it comes to the study
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:56.700]   of the Bible for our members because there are eternal consequences potentially at stake.
[00:42:56.700 --> 00:43:02.500]   One Bible study a week and one sermon are totally not enough.
[00:43:02.500 --> 00:43:06.980]   This is not to restrict or stifle you or make you feel guilty, okay?
[00:43:06.980 --> 00:43:13.720]   But if you were to eat only two meals a week every week, I lovingly should call you out
[00:43:13.720 --> 00:43:19.980]   on that because you should be eating on average 20 times a week feeding your face, something,
[00:43:19.980 --> 00:43:21.260]   even small.
[00:43:21.260 --> 00:43:24.620]   But two times a week is not enough.
[00:43:24.620 --> 00:43:27.380]   It's better than zero.
[00:43:27.380 --> 00:43:31.860]   So being in the habit of coming to Bible study not prepared or regularly skipping it, that
[00:43:31.860 --> 00:43:33.140]   is not a problem.
[00:43:33.140 --> 00:43:34.900]   That is a symptom of a big problem.
[00:43:34.900 --> 00:43:37.780]   Are you guys following this?
[00:43:37.780 --> 00:43:40.060]   Not coming prepared is not the problem.
[00:43:40.060 --> 00:43:42.260]   It's a symptom of a larger problem.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:47.300]   And I found that usually people who aren't prepared for the study, who are regularly
[00:43:47.300 --> 00:43:52.140]   the slack in their preparation for the corporate study of His Word, are usually not engaging
[00:43:52.140 --> 00:43:54.580]   in it privately.
[00:43:54.580 --> 00:43:58.460]   Now again, there are exceptions to the rule, so don't throw something at me, okay, if you're
[00:43:58.460 --> 00:44:01.460]   like, "Well, I don't prepare for the Bible study, but I do it on my own."
[00:44:01.460 --> 00:44:03.900]   Okay, so if that's you, then great, hallelujah.
[00:44:03.900 --> 00:44:08.420]   But generally speaking, people who aren't prepared for the proper study of His Word
[00:44:08.420 --> 00:44:18.700]   usually aren't doing Bible intake the rest of the week.
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:22.540]   Generally speaking, one of the first signs of struggle I observed at our church is a
[00:44:22.540 --> 00:44:28.500]   gradual checking out from Bible study.
[00:44:28.500 --> 00:44:31.380]   And my guess and my assumption is that if you're not keeping up with the church Bible
[00:44:31.380 --> 00:44:37.220]   study, you're not keeping up with your own personal devotions.
[00:44:37.220 --> 00:44:41.940]   And that's of great concern to me because I care about your well-being.
[00:44:41.940 --> 00:44:45.260]   The Word of God is foundational for your growth.
[00:44:45.260 --> 00:44:48.620]   Now this is for you guys who are keeping up with the Bible study, who are enjoying the
[00:44:48.620 --> 00:44:49.620]   inductive study.
[00:44:49.620 --> 00:44:52.740]   May I challenge you to go deeper?
[00:44:52.740 --> 00:44:58.260]   May I encourage you to an intense, passionate study of His Word?
[00:44:58.260 --> 00:45:01.940]   May I encourage you to memorize as much Bible as you can?
[00:45:01.940 --> 00:45:07.820]   Make it your ambition to have a bucket list memorizing 31,100 plus verses.
[00:45:07.820 --> 00:45:13.560]   Know His Word, love His Word, live His Word, share His Word, and make sure you know exactly
[00:45:13.560 --> 00:45:14.560]   what you're talking about.
[00:45:14.560 --> 00:45:17.940]   Let the Word of God transform every aspect of your life.
[00:45:17.940 --> 00:45:19.020]   Go deeper.
[00:45:19.020 --> 00:45:23.060]   Don't stop at covenant number five.
[00:45:23.060 --> 00:45:27.940]   Imagine if you just memorized one book a year and retained it 10 years from now.
[00:45:27.940 --> 00:45:30.980]   Do you not think you're going to be a more intimate believer?
[00:45:30.980 --> 00:45:32.940]   You don't think you'll have a deeper walk with God?
[00:45:32.940 --> 00:45:34.940]   You don't think you'll be sounder in your faith?
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:37.580]   Shame on you if you've been a Christian for 20 years and you have no understanding of
[00:45:37.580 --> 00:45:39.560]   the Word of God.
[00:45:39.560 --> 00:45:45.320]   Know His Word because what I say on the pulpit, if I say wrong things, you should call us
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:46.460]   out on it.
[00:45:46.460 --> 00:45:49.340]   Know His Word.
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:52.880]   Why memorization?
[00:45:52.880 --> 00:45:55.940]   The blessing of the Lord and the nearness of the Lord follows those who meditate on
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:45:59.340]   the law of the Lord day and night.
[00:45:59.340 --> 00:46:01.900]   And you cannot meditate on something you have not memorized.
[00:46:01.900 --> 00:46:04.420]   Are you guys following this?
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:09.780]   You cannot meditate on something day and night if you just do a Bible skim.
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:10.860]   Check.
[00:46:10.860 --> 00:46:11.860]   That is not the goal.
[00:46:11.860 --> 00:46:15.480]   You reading the Bible through in one year, great for you.
[00:46:15.480 --> 00:46:21.300]   It does zero for your soul in that if that's all you're doing it for, you're not feeding.
[00:46:21.300 --> 00:46:26.100]   It's just like licking a hamburger and then saying, "I've eaten."
[00:46:26.100 --> 00:46:30.780]   Go deep.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:33.300]   Memorization is not the goal, it's the means.
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:37.940]   The means for properly responding to the Word of God throughout every moment of every day.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:40.460]   That it kind of flows through your prayers even.
[00:46:40.460 --> 00:46:46.820]   That the Word of God is so saturating your mind and your heart, you see things clearly.
[00:46:46.820 --> 00:46:48.620]   So don't just stop at number five.
[00:46:48.620 --> 00:46:50.300]   That's where you start.
[00:46:50.300 --> 00:46:51.300]   Don't let that be your goal.
[00:46:51.300 --> 00:46:53.700]   I've done it.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:55.980]   That's there for you to thrive.
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:47:06.140]   That's not there for you to get just a whack on the spiritual bottom.
[00:47:06.140 --> 00:47:13.260]   As a church, we want to hold fast to these covenants so that we can build His church
[00:47:13.260 --> 00:47:16.660]   the way He wants it to be built.
[00:47:16.660 --> 00:47:18.420]   Amen?
[00:47:18.420 --> 00:47:24.340]   We want to be those on the small and the narrow encouraging others on the small and the narrow.
[00:47:24.340 --> 00:47:27.580]   We want to be able to say, "That's a false prophet, but hey, let me reach out to this
[00:47:27.580 --> 00:47:28.580]   false prophet.
[00:47:28.580 --> 00:47:30.220]   Maybe he can be on the small and the narrow too."
[00:47:30.220 --> 00:47:35.300]   The only way to do that is not by logic, is not by study, or apologetic study.
[00:47:35.300 --> 00:47:40.220]   It's by the Word of God, which is living and active and sharper than any double-edged sword.
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.540]   The Word of God is powerful.
[00:47:41.540 --> 00:47:48.260]   It's sufficient to change and transform dumb people to make them saints.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:49.540]   Amen?
[00:47:49.540 --> 00:47:58.460]   Luke 6, 46 to 49, "Why do you call me Lord, Lord, and do not do what I say?
[00:47:58.460 --> 00:48:03.620]   Everyone who comes to me and hears my words and acts on them, I will show you whom he
[00:48:03.620 --> 00:48:05.460]   is like.
[00:48:05.460 --> 00:48:10.460]   He is like a man building a house who dug deep and laid a foundation on the rock.
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:14.340]   And when a flood occurred, the torrent burst against that house and could not shake it
[00:48:14.340 --> 00:48:17.740]   because it had been well built.
[00:48:17.740 --> 00:48:21.780]   But the one who has heard and has not acted accordingly is like a man who built his house
[00:48:21.780 --> 00:48:26.240]   on the ground without any foundation, and the torrent burst against it, and immediately
[00:48:26.240 --> 00:48:32.380]   it collapsed, and the ruin of that house was great.
[00:48:32.380 --> 00:48:37.820]   May the Lord move us to be a church full of people building on the solid rock of Jesus
[00:48:37.820 --> 00:48:38.820]   Christ."
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:41.820]   Amen?
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:45.780]   Sanctify them by the truth.
[00:48:45.780 --> 00:48:47.980]   Your word is truth.
[00:48:47.980 --> 00:48:53.940]   Let his truth sanctify this church, grow this church, and build.
[00:48:53.940 --> 00:49:00.820]   We're going to take some time to pray.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:05.240]   And I want to ask you, how's your diet?
[00:49:05.240 --> 00:49:07.860]   People are asking me that all the time.
[00:49:07.860 --> 00:49:11.300]   I came in ninth place out of nine guys.
[00:49:11.300 --> 00:49:12.300]   I lost 15 pounds.
[00:49:12.300 --> 00:49:15.700]   I came in ninth place because we got some crazy people.
[00:49:15.700 --> 00:49:20.700]   But on that diet, everyone was asking me, "How's it going?"
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:23.140]   And then they take me to a soup plantation and fatten me up, right?
[00:49:23.140 --> 00:49:24.900]   "How's it going?"
[00:49:24.900 --> 00:49:30.940]   So I want to ask you, how's your diet?
[00:49:30.940 --> 00:49:36.980]   Bare minimum, you're going to get messed up with bare minimum.
[00:49:36.980 --> 00:49:44.260]   Bare minimum is going to cause you over time just to be a shell of religion.
[00:49:44.260 --> 00:49:48.320]   How are you doing in terms of your diet?
[00:49:48.320 --> 00:49:50.620]   You are what you eat.
[00:49:50.620 --> 00:49:51.940]   Pray.
[00:49:51.940 --> 00:49:52.940]   Ask God for help.
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:55.980]   The Bible is a big book.
[00:49:55.980 --> 00:49:58.460]   Ask him to help you learn it.
[00:49:58.460 --> 00:50:02.340]   Ask him to lead you to people who will help you learn it.
[00:50:02.340 --> 00:50:08.300]   Ask him to make you so adept in the knowledge of the word of God that you are a soul saver
[00:50:08.300 --> 00:50:09.300]   with your life.
[00:50:09.300 --> 00:50:13.340]   So let's take some time to pray, and then the worship team is going to come up.
