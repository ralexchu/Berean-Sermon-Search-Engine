[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.320]   Hi everyone, my name is George Wu and I'm currently a junior in high school.
[00:00:09.320 --> 00:00:13.400]   I'd grown up as the youngest in a family of four boys.
[00:00:13.400 --> 00:00:17.160]   Our parents had already been attending church and as a result I'd also been brought into
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:19.600]   church at a young age.
[00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:23.280]   I'd be going to church for the games that happened afterwards and for a better group
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:24.280]   of friends.
[00:00:24.280 --> 00:00:29.240]   At the time I didn't know the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian and just assumed
[00:00:29.240 --> 00:00:33.240]   I'd been a Christian and had no doubt that I was going to heaven.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.600]   Just because I may have thought I'd been a good person and my attitude for getting to
[00:00:36.600 --> 00:00:41.240]   heaven was to just be a morally good person.
[00:00:41.240 --> 00:00:44.560]   I'd be served in the AV team for the youth group there.
[00:00:44.560 --> 00:00:50.480]   As time went on, probably around the sixth or seventh grade, these convictions to go
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:53.960]   to church had found me.
[00:00:53.960 --> 00:01:06.040]   I thought I'd found a place where I could have some good friends who were going to be
[00:01:06.040 --> 00:01:08.800]   with me forever, but surely it may have failed me.
[00:01:08.800 --> 00:01:12.640]   I'd soon grow to hate the church.
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:21.240]   The church would become a burden on my life and I'd hate going to church.
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:26.120]   I'd hate going to church every Friday and Sunday and try to leave as soon as possible.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:28.520]   Eventually I'd stop going to church.
[00:01:28.520 --> 00:01:33.280]   In my school life I would try to be the most popular, try to gain validation from many
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:36.760]   of those around me and seek after this validation.
[00:01:36.760 --> 00:01:43.040]   I'd often do bad things where I'd go to parties, break rules, curse and continue to live a
[00:01:43.040 --> 00:01:46.960]   life full of sin.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:52.320]   The many fights with my parents infused within our family, I'd turn away from the church
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:58.040]   and continue to live a life full of sin.
[00:01:58.040 --> 00:02:02.360]   At this point I'd not found any meaning in life and I'd been very depressed.
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:12.160]   I was looking for a joy in the world that could never fulfill me.
[00:02:12.160 --> 00:02:18.560]   My brother Justin had asked us many times urging Charles and I to come out to Britain,
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.720]   but we'd always say hurtful things to him and continuously reject him.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:30.920]   One thing that I remember him saying to me was, "Hey George, I really think there's something
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:34.520]   special at the youth group there."
[00:02:34.520 --> 00:02:38.560]   Now I can remember him saying, now all I can remember saying to him was, or at least in
[00:02:38.560 --> 00:02:42.960]   my head was that he should stop asking me to come every week.
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:46.240]   I'm never going to come.
[00:02:46.240 --> 00:02:51.840]   One week after Justin had asked me again, I still don't know why, but I just had an
[00:02:51.840 --> 00:02:56.720]   urge to go and all I could say that it was God's grace and love over me that made me
[00:02:56.720 --> 00:02:57.720]   make this decision.
[00:02:57.720 --> 00:03:04.720]   Ephesians 2 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith and died not of yourselves,
[00:03:04.720 --> 00:03:07.880]   it is the gift of God."
[00:03:07.880 --> 00:03:13.120]   God has shown his love and grace to me by bringing me to Brain.
[00:03:13.120 --> 00:03:16.760]   After the first week of attending Brain's youth group, I'd seen how welcoming and loving
[00:03:16.760 --> 00:03:20.960]   both the students and teachers were and I felt a sense of belonging.
[00:03:20.960 --> 00:03:26.720]   Charles and I quickly integrated into the youth group and would continue to attend every
[00:03:26.720 --> 00:03:29.080]   Friday and Sunday, Thursday.
[00:03:29.080 --> 00:03:33.400]   After listening to many sermons about my sin, it felt like mold rotting inside me.
[00:03:33.400 --> 00:03:37.040]   I'd been very convicted and knew I had to change.
[00:03:37.040 --> 00:03:42.160]   God then had begun to reveal to me how much of a sinner I was and at that point I began
[00:03:42.160 --> 00:03:45.360]   to cut off the many bad influences in my life.
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:49.400]   By God's grace, I would soon find the desire to study and read his word and to cry out
[00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:51.680]   to him in prayer.
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.560]   I am reminded that his word is the only thing that can bring me joy, so I'll continue to
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:03:59.960]   strive to obey his word and continue to strive to live a life of holiness.
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:03.840]   The Lord is my strength and my shield, my heart trusts in him and I am helped.
[00:04:03.840 --> 00:04:07.200]   Therefore my heart drowns and with my song I shall thank him.
[00:04:07.200 --> 00:04:08.600]   Psalms 27.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   Thank you.
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:09.600]   [applause]
[00:04:09.600 --> 00:04:33.040]   >> So do you understand when you go into the water, you're imagining the heart that's
[00:04:33.040 --> 00:04:49.600]   moving, not what you're imagining the river of your life is.
