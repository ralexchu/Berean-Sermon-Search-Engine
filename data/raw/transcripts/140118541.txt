[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.000]   Because I wanted to run it where it's more of your observations bringing to conclusions
[00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.320]   that we can take home.
[00:00:13.320 --> 00:00:14.320]   Okay?
[00:00:14.320 --> 00:00:25.440]   But by way of kind of reintroducing this topic, let's take a look at the passage in first
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.400]   passage there.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:32.640]   Let's read that paragraph starting from verse 19 through 23 and it reads like this.
[00:00:32.640 --> 00:00:36.520]   For though I am free from all men, I have made myself a slave to all so that I may win
[00:00:36.520 --> 00:00:37.520]   more.
[00:00:37.520 --> 00:00:41.400]   To the Jews I've become as a Jew so that I might win Jews.
[00:00:41.400 --> 00:00:46.360]   To those who are under the law as under the law though not being myself under the law
[00:00:46.360 --> 00:00:48.920]   so that I might win those who are under the law.
[00:00:48.920 --> 00:00:52.920]   To those who are without law as without law though not being without the law of God but
[00:00:52.920 --> 00:00:57.680]   under the law of Christ so that I might win those who are without law.
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:00.720]   To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak.
[00:01:00.720 --> 00:01:05.480]   I have become all things to all men so that I may by all means save some.
[00:01:05.480 --> 00:01:10.440]   I do all things for the sake of the gospel so that I may become a fellow partaker of
[00:01:10.440 --> 00:01:11.440]   it.
[00:01:11.440 --> 00:01:12.440]   Okay?
[00:01:12.440 --> 00:01:18.880]   Now, I wanted to reintroduce this study with a YouTube video that I actually showed the
[00:01:18.880 --> 00:01:23.880]   youth group but upon second thought I decided not to because it shows this really buff African-American
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:25.560]   dude working out.
[00:01:25.560 --> 00:01:28.560]   It's a motivational video called Football Motivations.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.840]   If you want to YouTube it later, you can watch it, okay?
[00:01:31.840 --> 00:01:38.600]   But I'm going to try my best to tell the story that this video tries to tell.
[00:01:38.600 --> 00:01:42.920]   And essentially it tells of a story with a young man who wants to be very successful.
[00:01:42.920 --> 00:01:47.220]   He wants to make it huge in life so he goes out and searches for the guru, the guy who's
[00:01:47.220 --> 00:01:48.720]   made millions.
[00:01:48.720 --> 00:01:54.060]   So he goes to seek him and the journey just to go and seek this man is very difficult.
[00:01:54.060 --> 00:01:59.040]   Very busy man, highly esteemed and respected and has a lot of requests by young men.
[00:01:59.040 --> 00:02:04.080]   "Hey, can you teach me your ways so that I can be just as successful as you?"
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:06.560]   Well finally this guy gets the opportunity.
[00:02:06.560 --> 00:02:11.440]   It's not a common opportunity, it's a rare opportunity to get a one-on-one time with
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.360]   this guru so he finally gets this opportunity and says, "Teach me how I can be successful
[00:02:15.360 --> 00:02:16.880]   just as you."
[00:02:16.880 --> 00:02:21.200]   And the guru says, "Well then, tomorrow early, early morning, 6am, meet me at the
[00:02:21.200 --> 00:02:22.200]   beach."
[00:02:22.200 --> 00:02:24.720]   And so he goes to the beach and he finds a guru in the water.
[00:02:24.720 --> 00:02:27.000]   He's like, "The heck?"
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:30.480]   So he doesn't know what to think about it but he says, "Young man, come into the
[00:02:30.480 --> 00:02:31.480]   water with me."
[00:02:31.480 --> 00:02:32.720]   So they go in.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:34.200]   And then the guru says, "You know what?
[00:02:34.200 --> 00:02:36.280]   I need you to come into the water even further."
[00:02:36.280 --> 00:02:37.440]   So they go about waist high.
[00:02:37.440 --> 00:02:39.440]   And he says, "This is not enough.
[00:02:39.440 --> 00:02:41.160]   I want you to go on further with me."
[00:02:41.160 --> 00:02:42.640]   So he goes in about chest high.
[00:02:42.640 --> 00:02:44.880]   "This is not enough.
[00:02:44.880 --> 00:02:46.280]   I want you to go on further with me."
[00:02:46.280 --> 00:02:47.280]   And they go on to about neck deep.
[00:02:47.280 --> 00:02:50.720]   And all of a sudden, the guru grabs his head and dunks it in the water.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:56.040]   The young man is like flopping around, gasping for air, taking salt water into his mouth.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:59.800]   And he's just now about to fight this guru guy and toss him over.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:01.880]   And he finally lets go and gets up.
[00:03:01.880 --> 00:03:08.800]   And the guru says, "You gotta want success as bad as you want it this breath.
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:11.440]   Otherwise you won't succeed."
[00:03:11.440 --> 00:03:13.680]   And then in the background, there's this football guy working out.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:17.040]   He says, "How bad do you want it is the question."
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:18.320]   The guy's all sweaty.
[00:03:18.320 --> 00:03:20.000]   He's already really tired.
[00:03:20.000 --> 00:03:21.680]   His coaches are pushing him.
[00:03:21.680 --> 00:03:23.000]   He's throwing tires around.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:25.200]   But why throw tires around?
[00:03:25.200 --> 00:03:26.480]   He's jumping over fences.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:29.880]   He's dragging heavy objects behind him.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:30.880]   And he's doing push-ups.
[00:03:30.880 --> 00:03:35.280]   And he's working out until parts of the video shows him working out to the extent that he's
[00:03:35.280 --> 00:03:37.280]   puking on the floor.
[00:03:37.280 --> 00:03:43.340]   But the question of the video is, how badly do you want to succeed?
[00:03:43.340 --> 00:03:48.680]   So I showed that video to the youth group because I felt like in this generation, there's
[00:03:48.680 --> 00:03:51.480]   this lack of drive.
[00:03:51.480 --> 00:03:56.360]   But when I see Apostle Paul's example in the passage from verse 19 through 23, what I see
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:04:06.340]   is I'm so driven, I'm so driven, this insatiable desire to see people saved, it moves me.
[00:04:06.340 --> 00:04:10.020]   It moves me to be a Jew.
[00:04:10.020 --> 00:04:14.560]   If I have to look like a Jew to win the Jew, then I'm going to do it.
[00:04:14.560 --> 00:04:15.560]   It drives him.
[00:04:15.560 --> 00:04:18.320]   If I have to look like a Gentile, then I'll do it.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:22.440]   And it just drives him and drives him for that end purpose.
[00:04:22.440 --> 00:04:25.000]   I want to win people.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.080]   Isn't that how the passage sounds to you when he says, "I do all things for the sake of
[00:04:29.080 --> 00:04:30.080]   the gospel."
[00:04:30.080 --> 00:04:37.280]   When was the last time we were able to use that kind of all-inclusive term like that?
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.600]   "I do everything for this purpose."
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:42.200]   Pretty crazy, right?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:50.000]   So I want to remind you that Apostle Paul, just in review of what we did last time, he
[00:04:50.000 --> 00:04:56.580]   says, "To the extent that I may win some," that's verse 19, "so that I may win more,
[00:04:56.580 --> 00:04:57.580]   I have," what?
[00:04:57.580 --> 00:05:00.320]   "Made myself a slave.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:03.440]   Made myself a second-class citizen.
[00:05:03.440 --> 00:05:04.620]   Not even a citizen.
[00:05:04.620 --> 00:05:06.160]   Made myself property.
[00:05:06.160 --> 00:05:10.240]   At the service of those who I desire to save."
[00:05:10.240 --> 00:05:14.840]   So that's the essence of verse 19 through 23.
[00:05:14.840 --> 00:05:18.400]   But what were, I want to ask you guys, what were some observations you guys wrote down
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:25.920]   for that paragraph?
[00:05:25.920 --> 00:05:30.720]   Just to save time, I'm going to call on a table and someone from that table, please
[00:05:30.720 --> 00:05:34.080]   take the initiative and just share any observation you found.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:39.360]   Remember that observations can be incredibly obvious because it's simply an observation.
[00:05:39.360 --> 00:05:40.360]   There it is.
[00:05:40.360 --> 00:05:42.820]   Like that's how you sometimes have to do.
[00:05:42.820 --> 00:05:47.940]   This table over here with the young dudes.
[00:05:47.940 --> 00:06:03.380]   Any observations from that paragraph?
[00:06:03.380 --> 00:06:04.380]   From verse 19 to 23.
[00:06:04.380 --> 00:06:05.380]   Thanks.
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.380]   Trying to take the easy ones.
[00:06:08.380 --> 00:06:09.380]   Just kidding.
[00:06:09.380 --> 00:06:10.380]   Thanks, Shane.
[00:06:10.380 --> 00:06:17.220]   But just from verse 19 to 20, we'll take it section at a time.
[00:06:17.220 --> 00:06:18.220]   Okay.
[00:06:18.220 --> 00:06:27.700]   So he says, "I've become all things to all men."
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.700]   That's a good thing to point out when he says, "I've become all things to all men," because
[00:06:31.700 --> 00:06:36.220]   he uses an inclusive term, all inclusive term by saying all.
[00:06:36.220 --> 00:06:42.500]   And I remember asking you guys to discuss it last time, which was, can you give us a
[00:06:42.500 --> 00:06:47.140]   healthy balance or I guess boundary?
[00:06:47.140 --> 00:06:50.220]   When would becoming all things be too much?
[00:06:50.220 --> 00:06:55.700]   Should we be willing to give up just about everything or how do we balance that out?
[00:06:55.700 --> 00:07:02.300]   Anybody want to tackle that question?
[00:07:02.300 --> 00:07:07.380]   Are there limits to the, "I've become all things to all men"?
[00:07:07.380 --> 00:07:16.140]   Sorry, one more time.
[00:07:16.140 --> 00:07:19.700]   Okay.
[00:07:19.700 --> 00:07:21.220]   Within the boundaries of God's law.
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:22.220]   Good.
[00:07:22.220 --> 00:07:26.380]   Within the boundaries of God's law.
[00:07:26.380 --> 00:07:32.460]   There's that famous passage of Apostle Paul standing before the court, all that kind of
[00:07:32.460 --> 00:07:33.460]   stuff.
[00:07:33.460 --> 00:07:35.460]   And he says, "You tell me what's right to obey you or God."
[00:07:35.460 --> 00:07:40.380]   So you got to stay within the boundaries of God's law because God's laws are higher.
[00:07:40.380 --> 00:07:47.180]   So there's a sense in which you can say that as a parameter, but obviously there's more
[00:07:47.180 --> 00:07:52.580]   to say because sometimes there are scenarios in which it might not be necessarily boundaries
[00:07:52.580 --> 00:07:59.520]   of God's law, but it's questions of more like the gray area.
[00:07:59.520 --> 00:08:02.720]   So for example, I'm going to give you these.
[00:08:02.720 --> 00:08:07.420]   For being Aberian, our church has talked a lot about stuff we won't do Aberian and stuff
[00:08:07.420 --> 00:08:09.100]   that we would do.
[00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:14.420]   When I was down in San Diego, right as I was leaving San Diego, our youth group was trying
[00:08:14.420 --> 00:08:20.660]   to make a decision, should we graffiti the walls because that's kind of like more hip.
[00:08:20.660 --> 00:08:23.860]   Back in my day, hip hop and that scene was so much popular.
[00:08:23.860 --> 00:08:27.460]   We're like, "Man, maybe we should just graffiti the walls and dress up the sanctuary, our
[00:08:27.460 --> 00:08:29.300]   youth group sanctuary."
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:31.740]   And there was a debate, should we do it, should we not?
[00:08:31.740 --> 00:08:36.860]   But the whole desire was we want to do this to attract the young ones and get them in.
[00:08:36.860 --> 00:08:41.500]   So in a decision criteria like that, how do you balance saying, "Okay, let's just be all
[00:08:41.500 --> 00:08:45.780]   things to all people, our generation's all about hip hop, let's deck this whole thing
[00:08:45.780 --> 00:08:49.580]   out with hip hop stuff."
[00:08:49.580 --> 00:08:54.020]   Is that an obeying God's law versus man's law kind of thing?
[00:08:54.020 --> 00:09:01.940]   Is there a wisdom to be said of that?
[00:09:01.940 --> 00:09:04.740]   I guess a better question too, I know I'm asking a lot of questions, a better question
[00:09:04.740 --> 00:09:10.580]   would be in the given context of what we're studying, is there more narrower parameters
[00:09:10.580 --> 00:09:14.540]   of what he means by became all things to all people is what I'm trying to basically get
[00:09:14.540 --> 00:09:15.540]   at.
[00:09:15.540 --> 00:09:16.540]   Yes?
[00:09:16.540 --> 00:09:39.900]   Is it something that will enhance the gospel or kind of enhance, that will highlight the
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:40.900]   gospel message amongst people or would it be something that would be a distraction?
[00:09:40.900 --> 00:09:41.900]   Excellent.
[00:09:41.900 --> 00:09:42.900]   Right.
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:43.900]   Good, good, good.
[00:09:43.900 --> 00:09:48.180]   Good answer.
[00:09:48.180 --> 00:09:51.820]   Anything else anybody want to add to that?
[00:09:51.820 --> 00:09:58.340]   Wisdom about becoming all things to all people.
[00:09:58.340 --> 00:10:01.860]   Yes?
[00:10:01.860 --> 00:10:15.860]   Okay, just do what's going to help you to just stay focused on God.
[00:10:15.860 --> 00:10:16.860]   Okay.
[00:10:16.860 --> 00:10:17.860]   Yeah.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:26.060]   So, we're talking about that because obviously in the immediate context remember that Apostle
[00:10:26.060 --> 00:10:33.140]   Paul is addressing a scenario where a group of people, what they were doing, it wasn't
[00:10:33.140 --> 00:10:35.420]   just bothering other people.
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:39.660]   Like gosh, that really bugs me.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:48.020]   For example, sometimes, I don't know, when we say something like that stumbles me, right?
[00:10:48.020 --> 00:10:52.180]   Remember that the stumbling in the immediate context isn't just a matter of like, oh, it
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:58.780]   stumbles me because like, let's say for someone asked a specific scenario, the worship music,
[00:10:58.780 --> 00:11:03.620]   it stumbles me because drums are too loud and it's just like really loud and annoying.
[00:11:03.620 --> 00:11:05.800]   It's really stumbling, right?
[00:11:05.800 --> 00:11:10.740]   Stumbling was more along the case of that either tempts me to sin or prevents me to
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:17.740]   focus in terms of like prevents me as a stumbling block, a hindrance to my devotion to God,
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.740]   right?
[00:11:18.740 --> 00:11:24.900]   So, there's wisdom carried out in that because in application, essentially saying if an individual
[00:11:24.900 --> 00:11:31.780]   is in their process of learning the gospel, converting, coming into the church, I'll do
[00:11:31.780 --> 00:11:35.300]   whatever it takes to remove the stumbling block, right?
[00:11:35.300 --> 00:11:39.340]   But I think there's a sense in which some people have misapplied this passage to say
[00:11:39.340 --> 00:11:44.140]   and because we're becoming all things to all people, then let's all become bikers because
[00:11:44.140 --> 00:11:46.520]   we live in a biker community.
[00:11:46.520 --> 00:11:51.060]   Let's become, you know, let's all dress this way because now there's wisdom in that, but
[00:11:51.060 --> 00:11:54.140]   that's not necessarily what Apostle Paul is talking about here.
[00:11:54.140 --> 00:11:55.140]   Okay?
[00:11:55.140 --> 00:12:01.020]   And I would essentially say, you know, in terms of limitations, there's a difference
[00:12:01.020 --> 00:12:07.380]   between obviously like when people are offended by something that they should be offended
[00:12:07.380 --> 00:12:13.420]   by as opposed to something that's just simply my preference in what I do, right?
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:18.120]   What I mean by that is someone can be offended by what we preach.
[00:12:18.120 --> 00:12:23.720]   Someone can be offended by the Bible, the gospel, church, how we do church, Christians,
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:25.220]   you know?
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.060]   But if that's the case, then they're essentially offended not by just that, but they're offended
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:31.560]   by God and that's just their problem.
[00:12:31.560 --> 00:12:38.360]   What Apostle Paul is saying is if they're offended simply by what I'm doing, being offended
[00:12:38.360 --> 00:12:41.160]   by preference like do I want to eat the meat or not?
[00:12:41.160 --> 00:12:42.900]   Do I want to drink that or not?
[00:12:42.900 --> 00:12:46.380]   Something that I have a right to, something I have a liberty to do, but they're offended
[00:12:46.380 --> 00:12:52.960]   as in they are stumbled by that, then my limitation of law kicks in and it says now their problem
[00:12:52.960 --> 00:12:53.960]   is my problem.
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   Okay?
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:12:56.520]   All right, I hope that helps.
[00:12:56.520 --> 00:12:59.380]   Any questions about that?
[00:12:59.380 --> 00:13:03.400]   I just at least wanted to address the fact that there is some misapplication of this
[00:13:03.400 --> 00:13:07.980]   passage because in the given context, Apostle Paul is addressing, remember, what's happened
[00:13:07.980 --> 00:13:09.980]   all the way from chapter eight.
[00:13:09.980 --> 00:13:10.980]   Okay?
[00:13:10.980 --> 00:13:11.980]   All right.
[00:13:11.980 --> 00:13:17.620]   Then moving forward, let's take a look at verse 24 to 27.
[00:13:17.620 --> 00:13:23.620]   He says, "Do you not know that those who run in a race all run, but only one receives the
[00:13:23.620 --> 00:13:25.100]   prize.
[00:13:25.100 --> 00:13:28.380]   Run in such a way that you may win.
[00:13:28.380 --> 00:13:32.540]   Everyone who competes in the games exercises self-control in all things.
[00:13:32.540 --> 00:13:36.620]   They then do it to receive a perishable wreath, but we an imperishable.
[00:13:36.620 --> 00:13:39.660]   Therefore I run in such a way as not without aim.
[00:13:39.660 --> 00:13:44.740]   I box in such a way as not beating the air, but I discipline my body and make it my slave
[00:13:44.740 --> 00:13:49.860]   so that after I have preached to others, I myself will not be disqualified."
[00:13:49.860 --> 00:13:52.420]   All right.
[00:13:52.420 --> 00:13:56.660]   Let's talk about some of the observations that you guys have made.
[00:13:56.660 --> 00:14:03.660]   So in your packet thing, I basically chopped down just verse by verse.
[00:14:03.660 --> 00:14:05.740]   So let's just take it verse by verse.
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:11.140]   Verse 24, that table with Mark, Eugene, Tyler, and can't see the back.
[00:14:11.140 --> 00:14:12.220]   Oh, Justin?
[00:14:12.220 --> 00:14:16.500]   What observations do you guys see from verse 24?
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.900]   Okay.
[00:14:18.900 --> 00:14:23.260]   All right.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:38.420]   So, one thing I want to mention about, yeah, he's saying like run with purpose or whatnot.
[00:14:38.420 --> 00:14:45.420]   Right now, let's try to make like, you know, that's kind of like a good summary of what
[00:14:45.420 --> 00:14:47.060]   he's intending to say.
[00:14:47.060 --> 00:14:48.060]   Right.
[00:14:48.060 --> 00:14:54.180]   So let's try to pay attention to just observation of what's being stated in this particular
[00:14:54.180 --> 00:14:55.180]   verse.
[00:14:55.180 --> 00:14:56.180]   Right.
[00:14:56.180 --> 00:14:57.180]   But that's right.
[00:14:57.180 --> 00:15:00.260]   I mean, Mark just essentially highlighted the command of the entire paragraph.
[00:15:00.260 --> 00:15:04.060]   If I were to ask, "Hey, what's an emphasis of this paragraph?"
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:05.060]   You would look for what?
[00:15:05.060 --> 00:15:06.060]   The main verb.
[00:15:06.060 --> 00:15:07.060]   Right.
[00:15:07.060 --> 00:15:09.500]   And typically it's a command verb.
[00:15:09.500 --> 00:15:12.300]   He has a command here for us and he says run.
[00:15:12.300 --> 00:15:13.300]   Right.
[00:15:13.300 --> 00:15:14.300]   He says run.
[00:15:14.300 --> 00:15:17.700]   He particularly says run in such a way that you may win.
[00:15:17.700 --> 00:15:24.700]   Any other observations you guys got from your table?
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:30.060]   Sorry?
[00:15:30.060 --> 00:15:33.060]   Discipline yourself?
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:35.500]   Okay.
[00:15:35.500 --> 00:15:40.580]   All right.
[00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:42.900]   Okay.
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:47.020]   Thank you.
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:53.700]   Now I don't want to necessarily cut hair here and I appreciate you guys, what you guys have
[00:15:53.700 --> 00:15:59.180]   said so far, but do you guys get the difference between when I say here's an observation as
[00:15:59.180 --> 00:16:04.660]   opposed to a concluding statement, as opposed to an interpretation, as opposed to looking
[00:16:04.660 --> 00:16:09.860]   at the passage and dwindling it down to, let's say a meditative point or something.
[00:16:09.860 --> 00:16:10.860]   Right.
[00:16:10.860 --> 00:16:14.540]   Because for example, if I'm looking for an observation, I'm looking carefully here and
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:19.940]   it says, you know, here in this passage, one of the things that we observe is he's highlighting
[00:16:19.940 --> 00:16:22.900]   the fact that when there's a race, only one person wins.
[00:16:22.900 --> 00:16:26.460]   That's an observation because that's directly what we observe from the passage.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.460]   Right.
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:31.060]   As opposed to some of the summary statements that you guys are making as opposed to saying,
[00:16:31.060 --> 00:16:33.180]   oh, he wants us to train hard.
[00:16:33.180 --> 00:16:36.300]   He wants us to be disciplined and he wants to run with the purpose.
[00:16:36.300 --> 00:16:37.300]   Right.
[00:16:37.300 --> 00:16:41.300]   Do you guys see the difference between observation and a concluding interpretation?
[00:16:41.300 --> 00:16:43.100]   Okay.
[00:16:43.100 --> 00:16:48.060]   So that's kind of what I'm, what I really hope to exercise today.
[00:16:48.060 --> 00:16:51.380]   That's why I kind of left the whole bunch of it blank because I wanted you guys to observe
[00:16:51.380 --> 00:16:58.620]   the details and it's good for us to see first and foremost, not like, oh, what's the point
[00:16:58.620 --> 00:17:00.100]   that I should take away?
[00:17:00.100 --> 00:17:01.460]   We just need to stop.
[00:17:01.460 --> 00:17:06.140]   Sometimes we just need to do a, like a preliminary step of stopping and saying, what does it
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:08.060]   plainly say to me?
[00:17:08.060 --> 00:17:09.060]   Right.
[00:17:09.060 --> 00:17:11.820]   As in like, is this, what is it simply stating?
[00:17:11.820 --> 00:17:12.820]   Okay.
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:15.860]   So before we interpret, piece together, apply.
[00:17:15.860 --> 00:17:16.980]   All right.
[00:17:16.980 --> 00:17:19.500]   So any other observations from verse 24?
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:22.660]   Did you have a hand?
[00:17:22.660 --> 00:17:23.660]   Okay.
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:24.660]   Good.
[00:17:24.660 --> 00:17:34.180]   There's an element in which, hey, if you're like in our race, you're in our race.
[00:17:34.180 --> 00:17:35.180]   There's participation.
[00:17:35.180 --> 00:17:36.180]   Okay.
[00:17:36.180 --> 00:17:37.180]   Good.
[00:17:37.180 --> 00:17:38.180]   That's a good observation.
[00:17:38.180 --> 00:17:39.180]   Any others?
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:40.180]   One more time.
[00:17:40.180 --> 00:17:45.180]   There's multiple racers.
[00:17:45.180 --> 00:17:47.740]   Okay.
[00:17:47.740 --> 00:17:50.220]   Any other observations?
[00:17:50.220 --> 00:17:51.220]   You run to win.
[00:17:51.220 --> 00:17:52.220]   Yeah.
[00:17:52.220 --> 00:17:55.960]   And I think you should probably underline that.
[00:17:55.960 --> 00:18:00.380]   So piece that all together and you get, you actually get a pretty profound statement that's
[00:18:00.380 --> 00:18:04.620]   obvious, but pretty hard hitting.
[00:18:04.620 --> 00:18:05.980]   We're all participating.
[00:18:05.980 --> 00:18:08.220]   There are multiple people.
[00:18:08.220 --> 00:18:12.220]   But if you're in it, you should be in it to win it.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:13.220]   Right?
[00:18:13.220 --> 00:18:14.220]   Yeah.
[00:18:14.220 --> 00:18:18.980]   So, that's kind of what I mean by, so as we're doing this, I hope you guys see, we're making
[00:18:18.980 --> 00:18:22.620]   observations, just listing the things that we see and then we're kind of coming out,
[00:18:22.620 --> 00:18:23.900]   what's his point?
[00:18:23.900 --> 00:18:27.580]   And his point is now we're starting to derive it from all those things.
[00:18:27.580 --> 00:18:28.580]   So good.
[00:18:28.580 --> 00:18:31.740]   And I just want us to think about that for a moment because I started off with one of
[00:18:31.740 --> 00:18:37.620]   these like, you know, I tried to do my best to re-tell the story of the YouTube video,
[00:18:37.620 --> 00:18:42.220]   but you think about that for a moment and he's commanding us to run, but obviously he's
[00:18:42.220 --> 00:18:47.900]   commanding us to run in such a way where it shows deeply that you want to win it.
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:48.900]   You know?
[00:18:48.900 --> 00:18:53.780]   And, you know, I remember when I first started watching sports, I always, always laugh at
[00:18:53.780 --> 00:18:57.380]   commentators because the commentators typically say stuff that's really obvious, you know,
[00:18:57.380 --> 00:19:00.300]   they'll say stuff like, oh, he's really going for it now.
[00:19:00.300 --> 00:19:02.060]   And I'm like, oh, so stupid commentators.
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:05.580]   Of course he's going for it now, you know, he's just playing.
[00:19:05.580 --> 00:19:10.860]   And then, and then sometimes you'll find that, you know, two teams are playing and then one
[00:19:10.860 --> 00:19:14.900]   team wins and then the commentators they'll say stuff like, oh, this team just ended up
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:16.300]   wanting it more.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:18.300]   This team just wanted to win.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.100]   And I always thought that, oh, that's so silly.
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.380]   Of course they wanted to win.
[00:19:22.380 --> 00:19:28.780]   But then sometimes you watch sports and you realize it's not everybody wants to win.
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:33.600]   You like watch some teams and they don't want to win at all.
[00:19:33.600 --> 00:19:36.680]   What they want is some players want recognition.
[00:19:36.680 --> 00:19:40.780]   Some players want better, you know, teammates.
[00:19:40.780 --> 00:19:44.300]   Some players want, you know, higher salary.
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:47.300]   They just all they really wanted to secure their spot for next year.
[00:19:47.300 --> 00:19:48.940]   They want to showcase.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:50.220]   Some players want revenge.
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:51.220 --> 00:19:54.740]   You've seen like, you know, you got that guy on your team who just goes nuts because he's
[00:19:54.740 --> 00:19:57.740]   so mad and some ref didn't call the foul and he wants revenge.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:20:04.040]   And you're like, oh my God, you're jeopardizing our entire game because you want revenge.
[00:20:04.040 --> 00:20:09.120]   And you realize so much, so many times in sports, you actually don't want to win.
[00:20:09.120 --> 00:20:12.920]   You have lots of different agendas, you know?
[00:20:12.920 --> 00:20:19.360]   And so I use that, I use that as a point to say, Apostle Paul is talking to a group of
[00:20:19.360 --> 00:20:23.600]   Christians in the church and they're fighting essentially, they're bickering.
[00:20:23.600 --> 00:20:27.520]   And then they're also writing and then they're also asking him, what do we do about these
[00:20:27.520 --> 00:20:30.200]   people who are prohibiting us from eating meat?
[00:20:30.200 --> 00:20:37.020]   And Apostle Paul almost has this question of, do you have the right goal in mind?
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:39.120]   Do you want to win?
[00:20:39.120 --> 00:20:40.840]   What is this that you want to do?
[00:20:40.840 --> 00:20:41.840]   Right?
[00:20:41.840 --> 00:20:44.720]   I think it's really apropos to their situation.
[00:20:44.720 --> 00:20:47.800]   It's a question of what do you really want?
[00:20:47.800 --> 00:20:48.800]   Right?
[00:20:48.800 --> 00:20:50.160]   What do you really want?
[00:20:50.160 --> 00:20:53.120]   And so that's verse 24 for us.
[00:20:53.120 --> 00:20:56.640]   A command that says, run in such a way that you win.
[00:20:56.640 --> 00:20:57.640]   Okay?
[00:20:57.640 --> 00:20:59.160]   That you want to win.
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:01.320]   Now we're going to unpack that with the other verses.
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.360]   Let's go to verse 25.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.480]   Okay.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:14.160]   So over here with this table right in the middle, smack in the middle, verse 25 is really,
[00:21:14.160 --> 00:21:16.880]   really short, but please highlight any observations.
[00:21:16.880 --> 00:21:20.200]   So now I'm just looking for straight, what does the passage say?
[00:21:20.200 --> 00:21:21.560]   Do you notice any nuances?
[00:21:21.560 --> 00:21:24.240]   Do you have any questions?
[00:21:24.240 --> 00:21:26.800]   Excellent.
[00:21:26.800 --> 00:21:37.360]   So he's definitely contrasting.
[00:21:37.360 --> 00:21:43.040]   You can just make the observation he's contrasting the perishable wreath with the imperishable.
[00:21:43.040 --> 00:21:44.640]   Okay?
[00:21:44.640 --> 00:21:47.040]   That's an excellent thing to notice.
[00:21:47.040 --> 00:21:50.040]   Anything else?
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:58.960]   An automatic, right when you do that, if you guys, you know, get into good Bible study
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:01.160]   habit, always ask why.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:05.640]   So he's contrasting the perishable wreath and imperishable wreath, and you can just
[00:22:05.640 --> 00:22:09.240]   answer the question like, no, duh, because the imperishable is worth more.
[00:22:09.240 --> 00:22:10.240]   Right?
[00:22:10.240 --> 00:22:11.240]   But you can ask why though.
[00:22:11.240 --> 00:22:13.560]   Why highlight this contrast?
[00:22:13.560 --> 00:22:19.560]   What is it trying to make me understand between those contrasts?
[00:22:19.560 --> 00:22:21.280]   Right?
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:22.320]   Okay.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.520]   So any other observations from verse 25?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:28.920]   Great.
[00:22:28.920 --> 00:22:33.400]   Everybody who completes in the games exercises self-control.
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:34.400]   Okay.
[00:22:34.400 --> 00:22:35.400]   Good.
[00:22:35.400 --> 00:22:39.800]   So let's talk about that a little bit more.
[00:22:39.800 --> 00:22:41.880]   So self-control in what area?
[00:22:41.880 --> 00:22:44.240]   What sphere?
[00:22:44.240 --> 00:22:46.240]   All things.
[00:22:46.240 --> 00:22:52.080]   And I find that pretty interesting to think about because, so do this in your Bible study.
[00:22:52.080 --> 00:22:57.200]   So take a moment to think about that and then picture the athlete.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:02.240]   So you realize the athlete, he's just an athlete.
[00:23:02.240 --> 00:23:03.240]   He plays sports.
[00:23:03.240 --> 00:23:05.500]   You know, he competes.
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:10.760]   But think for a moment, that competition, what areas of his life does it affect?
[00:23:10.760 --> 00:23:12.960]   Everything.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.640]   His diet, his sleeping pattern, his exercise regimen, his family, his entertainment, his
[00:23:19.640 --> 00:23:20.640]   relationships.
[00:23:20.640 --> 00:23:21.640]   Right?
[00:23:21.640 --> 00:23:27.160]   Now, I'm not a big fan of Mike Tyson, but so once in a while, if you guys kind of didn't
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:32.080]   guess, I like watching motivational videos and there is this workout montage with Mike
[00:23:32.080 --> 00:23:34.520]   Tyson and it's one of the most amazing things I've seen.
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:35.520]   This guy is like a bull.
[00:23:35.520 --> 00:23:39.880]   I mean, when he was young, there was nothing that was going to stop him.
[00:23:39.880 --> 00:23:42.780]   And he just flat out said, like, I work harder than all these guys.
[00:23:42.780 --> 00:23:47.560]   So he was very arrogant, but he said, none of these other guys wake up at 4.30, 5.30
[00:23:47.560 --> 00:23:48.560]   to run.
[00:23:48.560 --> 00:23:49.560]   You know?
[00:23:49.560 --> 00:23:52.640]   And then that's what he did every single day.
[00:23:52.640 --> 00:23:56.560]   And until he won his championship, he said, basically, I didn't know a woman.
[00:23:56.560 --> 00:24:00.400]   I didn't have a relationship with a woman at all because I was just so focused.
[00:24:00.400 --> 00:24:04.080]   Now later on, obviously because of his success, it got to him, all that kind of stuff.
[00:24:04.080 --> 00:24:07.840]   But you look at his workout montage, it's just crazy.
[00:24:07.840 --> 00:24:14.200]   His diet to who he allowed into his life, who he allowed to talk to him.
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:18.920]   He would even put limitations on what he, what would enter into his mind.
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:23.640]   And his trainer had very specific things he wanted to like brainwash Mike Tyson with.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:27.000]   It was really crazy, but he was so dedicated to win.
[00:24:27.000 --> 00:24:29.120]   It literally affected everything.
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:30.120]   Everything.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:32.600]   It was quite crazy.
[00:24:32.600 --> 00:24:33.680]   Okay?
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:38.800]   On the flip side of that, sometimes you know what's really good for me in the Bible studies
[00:24:38.800 --> 00:24:47.040]   is whenever I start to derive like a point like this, I ask, what is the common fallen
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.920]   condition?
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:57.760]   Common fallen condition, meaning typically, typically for all of us, how do we compare
[00:24:57.760 --> 00:24:58.760]   to this?
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:04.680]   And what's the typical fallen condition as opposed to this biblical teaching here?
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:07.800]   Teaching that if you want to compete, then you have to exercise self-control.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:12.800]   Let me ask you guys this question.
[00:25:12.800 --> 00:25:18.800]   So when you think about that, the exhortation of like exercise self-control, what do you
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.120]   think of as a common fallen condition?
[00:25:25.120 --> 00:25:27.640]   How much we lack self-control.
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:35.200]   And if you were to epitomize, describe somebody who lacked self-control, what kind of things
[00:25:35.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   would you say of that?
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:42.720]   Let's say this man, a guy who was really like uncontrolled, what would you say?
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:50.200]   How would you describe?
[00:25:50.200 --> 00:25:55.280]   Just not, okay, so not specific to this verse, but not thinking more about like just our
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:25:58.800]   life, common things that happen in our day.
[00:25:58.800 --> 00:25:59.800]   Sloth.
[00:25:59.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   Sloth, good.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:09.800]   Not necessarily getting drunk, but being subdued to mastermind things.
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:14.800]   Whether it's video games, whatever.
[00:26:14.800 --> 00:26:15.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:15.800 --> 00:26:16.800]   That idea.
[00:26:16.800 --> 00:26:17.800]   Okay, excellent.
[00:26:17.800 --> 00:26:18.800]   Yeah.
[00:26:18.800 --> 00:26:24.120]   So in my mind, the reason why we do that about whenever there's a principle, I try to think
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:31.040]   of the common fallen condition is because it helps me to have a more detailed picture
[00:26:31.040 --> 00:26:37.140]   of that whole idea in my mind, sanctification, the Bible sums up as put off and put on.
[00:26:37.140 --> 00:26:40.280]   So a lot of times what's going to be convicting me is if the Bible is starting to describe
[00:26:40.280 --> 00:26:45.320]   to me what I need to put on, it's helpful for me to think about what to put off, right?
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:51.040]   But you think about what Jason just said, yeah, the Bible actually talks a lot about
[00:26:51.040 --> 00:26:55.280]   this, the man who lacks self-control, the sluggard.
[00:26:55.280 --> 00:27:00.160]   As a matter of fact, I'm going to read you a passage here, Proverbs chapter 21, verse
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:01.160]   25 to 26.
[00:27:01.160 --> 00:27:02.160]   Okay.
[00:27:02.160 --> 00:27:05.360]   Proverbs chapter 21, verse 25 to 26.
[00:27:05.360 --> 00:27:11.040]   It says, "The desire of the sluggard kills him, for his hand refuses to labor.
[00:27:11.040 --> 00:27:16.920]   All day long he craves and craves, but the righteous gives and does not hold back."
[00:27:16.920 --> 00:27:18.600]   Okay.
[00:27:18.600 --> 00:27:24.560]   In my mind, the epitome of a man who is not self-controlled is a man who's completely
[00:27:24.560 --> 00:27:28.920]   driven and functions based on his cravings.
[00:27:28.920 --> 00:27:30.040]   I want cake.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:33.480]   I have a race tomorrow, I eat cake.
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:34.680]   You're driven by cravings.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:39.880]   I need to wake up or I need to sleep tonight in order to go to work tomorrow, but I want
[00:27:39.880 --> 00:27:43.400]   to play video games, so I just want to play video games.
[00:27:43.400 --> 00:27:47.560]   I want to wake up, but I'm tired, so I stay in bed.
[00:27:47.560 --> 00:27:54.320]   Your life is just dictated by all your cravings, as opposed to exercising self-control in all
[00:27:54.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   areas.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:58.400]   Here's another passage, Proverbs 13, verse 4.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:02.520]   "The soul of the sluggard craves and gets nothing, while the soul of the diligent is
[00:28:02.520 --> 00:28:03.960]   richly supplied."
[00:28:03.960 --> 00:28:09.480]   Notice how to the lazy individual, the Bible calls him a man of cravings.
[00:28:09.480 --> 00:28:12.400]   You would think someone who's a sluggard has no cravings, no ambitions.
[00:28:12.400 --> 00:28:14.640]   Actually it's the opposite.
[00:28:14.640 --> 00:28:18.400]   Lazy people actually want a whole bunch.
[00:28:18.400 --> 00:28:20.560]   They're just not willing to work for it.
[00:28:20.560 --> 00:28:24.600]   The scripture says that the lazy individual, they will never harvest, but when it comes
[00:28:24.600 --> 00:28:27.440]   time to reap, they'll still be looking.
[00:28:27.440 --> 00:28:29.700]   Is there anything for me?
[00:28:29.700 --> 00:28:33.600]   Because that's the man driven by his impulses, man driven by his cravings.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:34.600]   And you know what's really interesting?
[00:28:34.600 --> 00:28:42.200]   If you look in your Bible, go to 1 Corinthians chapter 10, the next chapter, right?
[00:28:42.200 --> 00:28:44.640]   Oh no.
[00:28:44.640 --> 00:28:48.920]   Okay, can I have someone read that for us really quickly?
[00:28:48.920 --> 00:28:52.400]   Can someone read from verses 1 down to verse 13?
[00:28:52.400 --> 00:29:00.400]   Can I have, yes, could you read that nice and clear?
[00:29:00.400 --> 00:29:05.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:05.360 --> 00:29:15.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:15.360 --> 00:29:25.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:25.360 --> 00:29:35.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:35.360 --> 00:29:45.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:45.360 --> 00:29:55.360]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:58.860]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:00.040]   >> Thank you.
[00:30:00.040 --> 00:30:03.520]   So as you read that passage, he says,
[00:30:03.520 --> 00:30:07.640]   the nation of Israel was an example for you.
[00:30:07.640 --> 00:30:11.240]   My question to you is, what did the nation of Israel do wrong?
[00:30:11.240 --> 00:30:17.440]   What was the negative example that Israel set?
[00:30:17.440 --> 00:30:27.120]   One more time.
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:31.840]   They just ate and played?
[00:30:31.840 --> 00:30:33.720]   OK, they just ate and played.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:34.760]   All right?
[00:30:34.760 --> 00:30:36.520]   Good.
[00:30:36.520 --> 00:30:38.960]   That's what it says, yeah.
[00:30:38.960 --> 00:30:40.160]   Anything else that you guys see?
[00:30:40.160 --> 00:30:45.080]   That they craved evil things.
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.920]   So put that together, what does it describe?
[00:30:47.920 --> 00:30:50.640]   Exactly what we were just talking about.
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:52.560]   It's really interesting, but Apostle Paul
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:56.320]   is saying, don't follow the example of a nation of Israel.
[00:30:56.320 --> 00:30:56.820]   Why?
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:30:59.620]   Because a nation of Israel completely
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.160]   had a loss of being self-control,
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:06.040]   and rather, they were just given into their cravings.
[00:31:06.040 --> 00:31:08.360]   They completely lost their sense of bearings.
[00:31:08.360 --> 00:31:10.200]   They completely lost their sense of goal.
[00:31:10.200 --> 00:31:12.840]   And if we were talking about what we were talking about just
[00:31:12.840 --> 00:31:17.320]   a moment ago, about having a right ambition,
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:19.520]   I gave the example of a young man who wanted success
[00:31:19.520 --> 00:31:22.080]   and how badly you should want it.
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:23.680]   And I gave the example of a sports team
[00:31:23.680 --> 00:31:28.080]   who should be wanting to win, but they weren't wanting to win.
[00:31:28.080 --> 00:31:29.820]   What's really crazy is a nation of Israel
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:32.540]   was coming out of Egypt being oppressed, enslaved,
[00:31:32.540 --> 00:31:35.900]   and murdered, and treated as slaves.
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:38.980]   But then they come out, and you remember what happened?
[00:31:38.980 --> 00:31:41.380]   They wanted food, and they started complaining.
[00:31:41.380 --> 00:31:43.460]   They wanted a nation like other people.
[00:31:43.460 --> 00:31:45.460]   They wanted so many other things, to the degree
[00:31:45.460 --> 00:31:46.940]   they started complaining like this.
[00:31:46.940 --> 00:31:49.420]   God, why in the world did you bring us out here?
[00:31:49.420 --> 00:31:50.420]   Can you send us back?
[00:31:50.420 --> 00:31:53.020]   At least back there we had food.
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.540]   I mean, those words came out of their mouth.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:59.740]   People who were slaves and asking God, please deliver us.
[00:31:59.740 --> 00:32:01.540]   Right?
[00:32:01.540 --> 00:32:05.820]   They were just people driven by the cravings of the moment.
[00:32:05.820 --> 00:32:06.700]   I want food?
[00:32:06.700 --> 00:32:08.460]   I'm going to accuse God.
[00:32:08.460 --> 00:32:09.940]   You don't love us.
[00:32:09.940 --> 00:32:11.460]   I want water?
[00:32:11.460 --> 00:32:12.460]   I'm going to accuse God.
[00:32:12.460 --> 00:32:13.380]   You're not our leader.
[00:32:13.380 --> 00:32:14.980]   We're going back.
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:17.900]   It's just crazy how much we're like that.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:20.580]   But essentially, it's very indicative of how
[00:32:20.580 --> 00:32:22.780]   we function sometimes.
[00:32:22.780 --> 00:32:24.100]   All right.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:27.980]   So in thinking about how this song connects,
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:29.860]   earlier someone made the mention of the fact
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:35.060]   that there is the observation that Apostle Paul
[00:32:35.060 --> 00:32:36.100]   is making this connection.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:39.500]   Look, if you compete in the games,
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:41.860]   you need to exercise self-control.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.020]   You need to exercise self-control in all things.
[00:32:45.020 --> 00:32:46.420]   OK?
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:49.380]   But then he makes this contrast that those people who
[00:32:49.380 --> 00:32:52.660]   are exercising for a competition do it
[00:32:52.660 --> 00:32:57.060]   for a perishable wreath, but we, an imperishable.
[00:32:57.060 --> 00:32:58.260]   OK?
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:32:59.900]   Now, I don't want to belabor the point,
[00:32:59.900 --> 00:33:02.940]   but you guys can easily tell what he's getting at.
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:05.300]   He's like, man, it doesn't make sense.
[00:33:05.300 --> 00:33:06.580]   You know?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:09.300]   He's like, I observe the pattern of the world,
[00:33:09.300 --> 00:33:12.660]   and they're willing to sacrifice all that stuff just
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:14.780]   so they can win.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:16.780]   You guys aren't willing to sacrifice food.
[00:33:19.460 --> 00:33:24.140]   Step one, an athlete should eat a healthy meal.
[00:33:24.140 --> 00:33:26.220]   Step one, you fail.
[00:33:26.220 --> 00:33:27.220]   Right?
[00:33:27.220 --> 00:33:28.780]   I mean, he's seeing an inconsistency.
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:30.740]   It's like they're doing it for a smaller thing.
[00:33:30.740 --> 00:33:32.500]   They're doing it for a worldly thing.
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:34.540]   It just makes sense that if they are in it,
[00:33:34.540 --> 00:33:36.420]   that they would make these sacrifices
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:38.620]   and be self-controlled.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.140]   And so on the greater level, that much more.
[00:33:42.140 --> 00:33:44.020]   In our spiritual eyes, we have a worldview
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.140]   that we are pursuing an inheritance that
[00:33:47.140 --> 00:33:50.140]   is worth more than the entire world.
[00:33:50.140 --> 00:33:52.940]   But you're not willing to sacrifice for it.
[00:33:52.940 --> 00:33:54.980]   You're not willing to be self-controlled in that
[00:33:54.980 --> 00:33:57.060]   matter, right?
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.500]   OK.
[00:33:58.500 --> 00:34:01.140]   Let's move forward.
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.500]   It's about 8 o'clock now.
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:04.060]   Verse 26.
[00:34:04.060 --> 00:34:07.460]   It says, "Therefore, therefore, I run in such a way
[00:34:07.460 --> 00:34:08.860]   as not without aim.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.060]   I box in such a way as not beating the air."
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:13.220]   OK?
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:17.300]   Let's do the ladies' table in the back.
[00:34:17.300 --> 00:34:19.420]   What observations do you guys have from that verse?
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:36.540]   OK, good.
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:39.780]   He says what he does and what he doesn't do.
[00:34:39.780 --> 00:34:40.740]   All right?
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:42.820]   What are some-- again, you can just
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:44.820]   throw out obvious ones, and that's fine.
[00:34:44.820 --> 00:34:50.620]   I know sometimes, like even when I'm doing my own Bible study,
[00:34:50.620 --> 00:34:53.260]   I sometimes wonder, like, should I write down all the obvious
[00:34:53.260 --> 00:34:54.700]   observations I'm making?
[00:34:54.700 --> 00:34:57.220]   And you'll be surprised how much benefit
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:34:58.620]   you'll get just from doing it.
[00:34:58.620 --> 00:34:59.500]   OK?
[00:34:59.500 --> 00:35:01.100]   So what other things do you see there?
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:06.300]   OK.
[00:35:06.300 --> 00:35:08.300]   You say he makes his body his slave.
[00:35:08.300 --> 00:35:10.300]   OK.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:11.140]   What else do you see?
[00:35:11.140 --> 00:35:23.340]   Verse 26.
[00:35:23.340 --> 00:35:24.060]   That's fine, yeah.
[00:35:24.060 --> 00:35:25.340]   It's just the beginning of 27.
[00:35:25.340 --> 00:35:32.420]   OK, good.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:36.500]   So he's saying, "Run in such a way as not without aim,
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:39.300]   and I box in such a way as not beating the air."
[00:35:39.300 --> 00:35:40.580]   OK?
[00:35:40.580 --> 00:35:42.460]   So we start asking the questions now.
[00:35:42.460 --> 00:35:43.780]   So you guys stated the obvious.
[00:35:43.780 --> 00:35:47.540]   OK, I just reread the passage to you, Pastor Mark.
[00:35:47.540 --> 00:35:49.940]   What are we getting at here?
[00:35:49.940 --> 00:35:52.380]   Is there any distinction between the two,
[00:35:52.380 --> 00:35:54.300]   between running in such a way without aim,
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:35:58.020]   boxing in such a way as not beating the air?
[00:35:58.020 --> 00:36:01.580]   And you can ask the question.
[00:36:01.580 --> 00:36:06.220]   By giving these metaphors of the exercise and, like,
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.700]   boxing and stuff like that, I want to ask you,
[00:36:08.700 --> 00:36:11.580]   what is he specifically getting at?
[00:36:11.580 --> 00:36:13.620]   So let me ask that table with the ladies.
[00:36:13.620 --> 00:36:20.260]   OK, both of them have a target.
[00:36:20.260 --> 00:36:21.220]   Excellent.
[00:36:21.220 --> 00:36:23.580]   You guys should write that down.
[00:36:23.580 --> 00:36:26.180]   And I want to ask you guys a personal question from that.
[00:36:26.180 --> 00:36:29.780]   I think I can jump from that to a really quickly
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:31.900]   personal application.
[00:36:31.900 --> 00:36:33.820]   We all have certain goals.
[00:36:33.820 --> 00:36:35.060]   OK?
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:37.260]   Whether it be, I want to have a specific job,
[00:36:37.260 --> 00:36:39.220]   I want to be a certain place in five years,
[00:36:39.220 --> 00:36:43.340]   I want to grow a certain way or whatnot.
[00:36:43.340 --> 00:36:47.740]   But do you have a goal that you can actually
[00:36:47.740 --> 00:36:49.460]   verbalize to somebody?
[00:36:49.460 --> 00:36:55.020]   And the reason why I put it that way is because,
[00:36:55.020 --> 00:36:57.020]   do you have a goal that's actually
[00:36:57.020 --> 00:36:59.580]   clear enough in your head?
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:01.580]   And it's not, like, foggy.
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:02.740]   It's not so general.
[00:37:02.740 --> 00:37:05.700]   But it's specific enough that you can communicate it
[00:37:05.700 --> 00:37:09.500]   in specific words to someone.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:12.100]   And do you have that goal for your life?
[00:37:12.100 --> 00:37:15.820]   Not just, like, my next year, not just my career,
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:16.580]   but for your life.
[00:37:16.580 --> 00:37:23.380]   And I don't want to sound like a self-help guru guy
[00:37:23.380 --> 00:37:27.740]   or whatever, but recently, I re-read a book
[00:37:27.740 --> 00:37:31.100]   by Stephen Covey called "Seven Habits of Highly Effective
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:32.220]   People."
[00:37:32.220 --> 00:37:34.980]   And I thought it was incredibly helpful.
[00:37:34.980 --> 00:37:37.340]   And then I started wondering, man, is this guy Christian?
[00:37:37.340 --> 00:37:40.500]   Because a lot of the stuff he says actually
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:43.100]   comes straight out of the book of Proverbs.
[00:37:43.100 --> 00:37:45.100]   But one of the things that he really harvests on
[00:37:45.100 --> 00:37:48.180]   is start with a goal in mind.
[00:37:48.180 --> 00:37:52.060]   So start with the end in mind, he says, as in other words.
[00:37:52.060 --> 00:37:54.820]   And there's an element to which we actually need a goal.
[00:37:54.820 --> 00:37:56.700]   We actually need something like a target
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:57.740]   that we're shooting after.
[00:37:57.740 --> 00:37:58.460]   Why?
[00:37:58.460 --> 00:38:02.980]   Because that target helps us basically put away
[00:38:02.980 --> 00:38:06.380]   all the different distractions.
[00:38:06.380 --> 00:38:08.620]   That target actually helps us have a criteria
[00:38:08.620 --> 00:38:10.460]   to make a decision in life.
[00:38:10.460 --> 00:38:11.740]   Should I go down this road?
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:12.900]   Should I pick this job?
[00:38:12.900 --> 00:38:13.700]   Should I pick that?
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:15.260]   Should I pick this?
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:19.300]   It actually gives us a criteria to make appropriate decisions.
[00:38:19.300 --> 00:38:23.180]   Without it, you begin to neglect.
[00:38:23.180 --> 00:38:24.540]   Without it, you get distracted.
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:25.900]   Without it, you get confused.
[00:38:25.900 --> 00:38:26.780]   You get disoriented.
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.780]   And all that stuff happens.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:32.540]   So again, there are a couple of things.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.580]   A couple of things I want to highlight for you.
[00:38:34.580 --> 00:38:36.740]   Even in the book of Proverbs--
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.900]   oh, man.
[00:38:38.900 --> 00:38:41.780]   I didn't write down the chapter.
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:49.300]   Somewhere in the Bible, verses 30 through 34, says this.
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:50.540]   It's in the book of Proverbs.
[00:38:50.540 --> 00:38:51.860]   I'll find it for you guys later.
[00:38:51.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   He says, "I passed by a field of the sluggard
[00:38:53.860 --> 00:38:56.620]   and by the vineyard of a man lacking sense.
[00:38:56.620 --> 00:38:59.700]   And behold, it was completely overgrown with thistles.
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.260]   Its surface was covered with metals,
[00:39:01.260 --> 00:39:03.100]   and its stone wall was broken.
[00:39:03.100 --> 00:39:05.820]   When I saw, I reflected upon it.
[00:39:05.820 --> 00:39:08.180]   I looked, and I received instruction--
[00:39:08.180 --> 00:39:10.340]   a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding
[00:39:10.340 --> 00:39:12.460]   of the hands to rest, and then your poverty will come
[00:39:12.460 --> 00:39:14.500]   as a robber, and you'll want like an armed man."
[00:39:14.500 --> 00:39:19.940]   So the reason why I read that passage
[00:39:19.940 --> 00:39:22.540]   is because I find that, especially
[00:39:22.540 --> 00:39:24.340]   with the younger generations-- like right now, I'm
[00:39:24.340 --> 00:39:25.740]   working with youth group people, and I'm
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:26.740]   working with collegians.
[00:39:26.740 --> 00:39:29.060]   And there's a sense in which they're definitely
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:31.060]   living in the moment.
[00:39:31.060 --> 00:39:33.860]   And they're definitely not capable, right now at least,
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:35.980]   of seeing a clear target to say, this
[00:39:35.980 --> 00:39:39.500]   is why I'm doing what I'm doing.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:40.940]   And what ends up happening is there
[00:39:40.940 --> 00:39:42.980]   is this huge neglect then.
[00:39:42.980 --> 00:39:44.540]   And just like the author of Proverbs
[00:39:44.540 --> 00:39:47.260]   saying, you know what I notice is everything's overgrown.
[00:39:47.260 --> 00:39:48.740]   There's stuff that's not tended to.
[00:39:48.740 --> 00:39:52.620]   There are broken walls, but it's just a neglect.
[00:39:52.620 --> 00:39:55.540]   And in the moment, they're just like,
[00:39:55.540 --> 00:39:57.460]   what difference does it make if I sleep a little bit today?
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:59.100]   What difference does it make if I just play today?
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:00.480]   What difference does that make?
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.380]   Because they're young, and they don't have the end in mind.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.580]   So the challenge for us is to truly
[00:40:09.580 --> 00:40:14.060]   have a goal for ourselves that is strong, that's clear,
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:17.820]   and that we preemptively start with.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:23.060]   And I want to challenge you guys in this because if you do not
[00:40:23.060 --> 00:40:25.140]   have a goal--
[00:40:25.140 --> 00:40:28.260]   I feel like I've experienced every single one of these.
[00:40:28.260 --> 00:40:30.260]   You're either ruled by whatever is urgent.
[00:40:30.260 --> 00:40:32.820]   So if you get busy, you're just ruled by whatever is urgent,
[00:40:32.820 --> 00:40:35.100]   like now, exams, tests.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:36.820]   That's the only thing driving you.
[00:40:36.820 --> 00:40:39.980]   You get ruled by other people.
[00:40:39.980 --> 00:40:43.540]   You get ruled by, again, your cravings.
[00:40:43.540 --> 00:40:46.220]   You get ruled by everything else that does not matter.
[00:40:46.220 --> 00:40:51.940]   And there's just not much to show for it.
[00:40:51.940 --> 00:40:55.340]   But if we have a goal, you have clear reasons why.
[00:40:55.340 --> 00:40:57.140]   That's not for me.
[00:40:57.140 --> 00:40:59.660]   You have clear reasons why I can't do that.
[00:40:59.660 --> 00:41:01.460]   And that's the way it's supposed to operate
[00:41:01.460 --> 00:41:04.660]   as he's talking about that we need that kind of discipline,
[00:41:04.660 --> 00:41:07.780]   and we need to imitate those who are truly in the race.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:13.220]   All right.
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:13.980]   Verse 27.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:18.180]   Proverbs 24.
[00:41:18.180 --> 00:41:19.420]   Thank you, sir.
[00:41:19.420 --> 00:41:21.900]   Proverbs 24, verse 30 through 34.
[00:41:21.900 --> 00:41:24.020]   Great passage.
[00:41:24.020 --> 00:41:25.780]   OK.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:29.580]   Last verse, guys, verse 27.
[00:41:29.580 --> 00:41:32.540]   Table about right in front of me.
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:33.620]   Here.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:36.340]   Can you guys share with us what are your observations in this?
[00:41:36.340 --> 00:41:52.300]   Yeah, this table.
[00:41:55.300 --> 00:41:56.820]   He makes his body a slave.
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:59.380]   What does he do to his body?
[00:41:59.380 --> 00:42:01.620]   He disciplines it.
[00:42:01.620 --> 00:42:03.940]   So he makes his body a slave.
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:07.020]   Think about that a little bit.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:10.220]   He says, I make it my slave.
[00:42:10.220 --> 00:42:12.260]   Interesting.
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.820]   I discipline my body.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:23.020]   There's a question as to, in this struggle to compete,
[00:42:23.020 --> 00:42:26.100]   who is he competing against most of all?
[00:42:26.100 --> 00:42:27.740]   Himself.
[00:42:27.740 --> 00:42:30.740]   Interesting observation when you think about it.
[00:42:30.740 --> 00:42:34.620]   You know, there's a lot of runners at our church.
[00:42:34.620 --> 00:42:37.540]   And I'm going to be 100% honest with you guys.
[00:42:37.540 --> 00:42:40.300]   I always judge them to a certain degree
[00:42:40.300 --> 00:42:42.820]   because I just don't get running.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.340]   It just seems like an incredible waste of time.
[00:42:45.340 --> 00:42:47.300]   And I'm sitting there like, you only have one life to live,
[00:42:47.300 --> 00:42:48.060]   man.
[00:42:48.060 --> 00:42:49.980]   What are you doing running around in circles?
[00:42:49.980 --> 00:42:52.780]   [LAUGHTER]
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:56.260]   I'm so glad David's not here.
[00:42:56.260 --> 00:43:00.740]   And then not only that, but they run long distances.
[00:43:00.740 --> 00:43:03.420]   I'm sitting there like, oh my gosh, why?
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:04.660]   There literally is no point.
[00:43:04.660 --> 00:43:06.460]   At least with football, you're running fast,
[00:43:06.460 --> 00:43:07.980]   but you're getting to a goal.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:09.980]   You can celebrate at one point or another.
[00:43:09.980 --> 00:43:11.380]   But sometimes some of these people
[00:43:11.380 --> 00:43:13.820]   are just trying to see how far they can go.
[00:43:13.820 --> 00:43:17.340]   And I'm always sitting there like, OK.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:21.500]   But it makes sense.
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:22.860]   It makes sense why.
[00:43:22.860 --> 00:43:26.060]   Maybe because I've never tried long distance running.
[00:43:26.060 --> 00:43:30.540]   Maybe it's because I've never really tried it.
[00:43:30.540 --> 00:43:32.540]   But it makes sense that perhaps there
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:36.260]   is a joy to accomplishing something that's not necessarily
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:40.940]   beating another person, but it's overcoming your own limitation,
[00:43:40.940 --> 00:43:44.500]   overcoming your own time limit, overcoming your own pace,
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:48.260]   overcoming your own endurance.
[00:43:48.260 --> 00:43:51.340]   And truthfully speaking, we all would
[00:43:51.340 --> 00:43:54.460]   agree that perhaps in the life of faith
[00:43:54.460 --> 00:43:56.100]   and trying to struggle and being sanctified
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:43:58.600]   and all that kind of stuff, the person we're trying to fight
[00:43:58.600 --> 00:44:01.020]   most is ourselves.
[00:44:01.020 --> 00:44:02.900]   The Apostle Paul is essentially saying that.
[00:44:02.900 --> 00:44:06.740]   He realizes, or he's saying, in this fight,
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:09.860]   the main battleground perhaps is our own body.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:14.060]   And the goal then is to have mastery over it.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:15.620]   That when we talk about self-control,
[00:44:15.620 --> 00:44:17.300]   he's not talking about just like, oh, I'm
[00:44:17.300 --> 00:44:19.260]   not going to get mad today.
[00:44:19.260 --> 00:44:24.660]   But that his body is truly under the control of the Spirit
[00:44:24.660 --> 00:44:29.020]   and the control of what he knows to be right.
[00:44:29.020 --> 00:44:35.820]   And so I find, I find there are parts of me that sometimes just
[00:44:35.820 --> 00:44:39.660]   wants to live life where, yeah, I do as I please.
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:42.020]   Parts of me that wants to live life, if I feel like it,
[00:44:42.020 --> 00:44:44.220]   I want to just live in the moment.
[00:44:44.220 --> 00:44:48.260]   And then I just start imagining a fight between a father
[00:44:48.260 --> 00:44:50.780]   and a young child, like a teenager.
[00:44:50.780 --> 00:44:53.300]   A teenager might fight with his parents on something simple
[00:44:53.300 --> 00:44:55.020]   as when to sleep.
[00:44:55.020 --> 00:44:56.180]   The child is getting older.
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:57.640]   He's getting into his teenage year.
[00:44:57.640 --> 00:45:01.380]   And he's like, dude, I'm not going to go to sleep at 10.
[00:45:01.380 --> 00:45:02.940]   And the parents might fight over it.
[00:45:02.940 --> 00:45:04.580]   And the parents might sit there like, oh, yeah, yeah,
[00:45:04.580 --> 00:45:05.060]   it's cool.
[00:45:05.060 --> 00:45:07.980]   And then this child is sitting there saying,
[00:45:07.980 --> 00:45:11.660]   I can function if I sleep at 11, 12, doesn't matter.
[00:45:11.660 --> 00:45:13.860]   I'm going to be fine.
[00:45:13.860 --> 00:45:16.060]   And I start imagining that picture of the fight
[00:45:16.060 --> 00:45:17.580]   because it's a small thing.
[00:45:17.580 --> 00:45:20.860]   It's just like just sleep.
[00:45:20.860 --> 00:45:22.340]   And the reason I'm talking about it
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:26.100]   is because I recently had a thing with my son.
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.980]   He's like, you have to go to sleep right now.
[00:45:27.980 --> 00:45:29.260]   I was like, I'm not tired, Appa.
[00:45:29.260 --> 00:45:30.580]   He's like, I know you're tired.
[00:45:30.580 --> 00:45:31.820]   He's like, no, I'm not.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:32.900]   You have to go to sleep.
[00:45:32.900 --> 00:45:34.740]   And I just sit there on the night.
[00:45:34.740 --> 00:45:35.940]   Oh, he's only four.
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:38.460]   I can't believe I'm fighting with this one.
[00:45:38.460 --> 00:45:42.220]   I just anticipate what's going to happen later.
[00:45:42.220 --> 00:45:44.780]   But the thing about it is, I mean, yeah,
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:45.900]   it's just a small thing.
[00:45:45.900 --> 00:45:48.740]   And there's wisdom behind both.
[00:45:48.740 --> 00:45:53.460]   But there's a sense in which if it
[00:45:53.460 --> 00:45:57.300]   is an athlete who is truly trying to win,
[00:45:57.300 --> 00:46:00.620]   who is truly trying to train to the best he can,
[00:46:00.620 --> 00:46:04.700]   then even the smallest things become big things.
[00:46:04.700 --> 00:46:06.300]   It does.
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:09.740]   And so even though the runner, although he feels like resting,
[00:46:09.740 --> 00:46:11.620]   he's going to run.
[00:46:11.620 --> 00:46:13.380]   Although he feels like eating a burger,
[00:46:13.380 --> 00:46:16.100]   he's going to eat that salad or the balanced meal.
[00:46:16.100 --> 00:46:18.380]   Although he feels like he wants to stay up and hang out
[00:46:18.380 --> 00:46:20.780]   with all his friends, he's going to go home and rest.
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:23.340]   Although he feels like he wants to stay in bed and veg out,
[00:46:23.340 --> 00:46:26.340]   he's going to get up and exercise.
[00:46:26.340 --> 00:46:30.500]   Even the small things start becoming big things.
[00:46:30.500 --> 00:46:32.500]   And so I think we have to take heed of that when
[00:46:32.500 --> 00:46:35.180]   he's talking about here.
[00:46:35.180 --> 00:46:37.420]   There's a sense in which the reason why I bring that up
[00:46:37.420 --> 00:46:38.260]   is because--
[00:46:38.260 --> 00:46:39.980]   and I'm going to start wrapping this up--
[00:46:39.980 --> 00:46:42.100]   he says, after I preach to others,
[00:46:42.100 --> 00:46:45.300]   that I will not be disqualified.
[00:46:45.300 --> 00:46:46.940]   Now, there's an interpretive issue.
[00:46:46.940 --> 00:46:48.340]   What does he mean by disqualified?
[00:46:48.340 --> 00:46:50.940]   But before we get into the interpretive issue,
[00:46:50.940 --> 00:46:53.500]   I just want to conclude my point.
[00:46:53.500 --> 00:46:56.020]   We're talking about a guy who's just simply training.
[00:46:56.020 --> 00:46:57.860]   And he's trying to discipline his body.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:00.260]   But there is a warning that you might be disqualified
[00:47:00.260 --> 00:47:03.780]   because of the small things he's not disciplined in.
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:06.340]   Do you see my point?
[00:47:06.340 --> 00:47:08.380]   Perhaps we think it's small things.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:10.420]   Like, yeah, well, then what does it matter?
[00:47:10.420 --> 00:47:12.420]   I just want to do what I feel like I want to do.
[00:47:12.420 --> 00:47:14.900]   It's like, why do I have to be disciplined in this?
[00:47:14.900 --> 00:47:16.980]   Why do I have to sacrifice this thing?
[00:47:16.980 --> 00:47:18.260]   They're just all small deals.
[00:47:18.260 --> 00:47:19.580]   And granted, they are.
[00:47:19.580 --> 00:47:22.660]   That's why Apostle Paul's like, dude, this is a small deal.
[00:47:22.660 --> 00:47:25.420]   Whether you eat or don't eat, it doesn't make a huge difference.
[00:47:25.420 --> 00:47:27.740]   Whether you take that meat or don't take that meat,
[00:47:27.740 --> 00:47:29.460]   it's just not a big deal.
[00:47:29.460 --> 00:47:32.660]   But there's a sense in which the other part of reality
[00:47:32.660 --> 00:47:35.460]   is it is a big deal.
[00:47:35.460 --> 00:47:40.820]   Because by your negligence in it, it could disqualify you.
[00:47:40.820 --> 00:47:42.060]   Right?
[00:47:42.060 --> 00:47:43.420]   All right.
[00:47:43.420 --> 00:47:46.740]   Now, I want to ask you this question.
[00:47:46.740 --> 00:47:54.220]   He says, he says, I do all this because after I've preached,
[00:47:54.220 --> 00:47:56.420]   I don't want to be disqualified.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:47:59.140]   Now, remember that Apostle Paul said,
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:01.220]   I do everything so that I might win some.
[00:48:01.220 --> 00:48:03.780]   Like, here are these people I want to save.
[00:48:03.780 --> 00:48:06.420]   These are the people I want to share the gospel with.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.300]   But what do you think he's talking about here
[00:48:08.300 --> 00:48:11.140]   where he says, so that-- so that's like a purpose
[00:48:11.140 --> 00:48:13.820]   statement-- I discipline my body and make it my slave so
[00:48:13.820 --> 00:48:17.060]   that the purpose is I don't want to be disqualified.
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:18.620]   What do you think he's referring to?
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:25.820]   Sorry, someone said something.
[00:48:25.820 --> 00:48:27.380]   His witness.
[00:48:27.380 --> 00:48:28.660]   OK?
[00:48:28.660 --> 00:48:30.060]   How did you get to that conclusion?
[00:48:58.540 --> 00:48:59.040]   OK.
[00:48:59.040 --> 00:49:16.700]   OK.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:18.780]   Good.
[00:49:18.780 --> 00:49:21.020]   Any other thoughts about that?
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:21.520]   Joe?
[00:49:22.520 --> 00:49:24.520]   I was just thinking more along the lines
[00:49:24.520 --> 00:49:27.520]   of what you said earlier about how little things can
[00:49:27.520 --> 00:49:29.000]   disqualify you.
[00:49:29.000 --> 00:49:34.000]   So maybe I'm not succumbing to this fleshly self,
[00:49:34.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   whether it's in the mind or the flesh,
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:41.000]   bad habits that can develop into a full-blown sin.
[00:49:41.000 --> 00:49:42.000]   OK.
[00:49:42.000 --> 00:49:45.480]   And eventually, you fall away and you drift.
[00:49:45.480 --> 00:49:47.480]   But I don't know if I'm just taking it too far.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:48.480]   OK.
[00:49:48.480 --> 00:49:50.480]   No, that's a good logical thought.
[00:49:50.480 --> 00:49:54.320]   He's saying essentially, for him, disqualifying--
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:56.880]   in his mind, he's picturing full-blown sin.
[00:49:56.880 --> 00:49:58.680]   You make smaller compromises.
[00:49:58.680 --> 00:50:01.080]   And that leads into a kind of character trait
[00:50:01.080 --> 00:50:03.560]   of sin in your life that would eventually
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:04.480]   be disqualified, right?
[00:50:04.480 --> 00:50:05.480]   So yeah.
[00:50:05.480 --> 00:50:08.480]   So by not disciplining yourself, you're
[00:50:08.480 --> 00:50:10.480]   going to give in to those desires.
[00:50:10.480 --> 00:50:11.480]   OK.
[00:50:11.480 --> 00:50:11.980]   OK.
[00:50:16.480 --> 00:50:19.480]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:33.980]   OK.
[00:50:45.980 --> 00:50:47.480]   Gotcha.
[00:50:47.480 --> 00:50:47.980]   OK.
[00:50:47.980 --> 00:50:53.980]   Gotcha.
[00:50:53.980 --> 00:50:55.480]   OK.
[00:50:55.480 --> 00:50:56.480]   Gotcha.
[00:50:56.480 --> 00:50:58.980]   So I want to let you know that actually good and godly men
[00:50:58.980 --> 00:51:02.480]   disagree a lot about this, about this verse.
[00:51:02.480 --> 00:51:10.480]   And no one position is like 100% like locked down the best one.
[00:51:10.480 --> 00:51:12.480]   Because actually, some people use this passage
[00:51:12.480 --> 00:51:14.980]   to mean Apostle Paul is genuinely
[00:51:14.980 --> 00:51:19.480]   saying that he can be disqualified from salvation.
[00:51:19.480 --> 00:51:22.480]   As in, like, there are people, like in Matthew chapter 10,
[00:51:22.480 --> 00:51:23.480]   who preach the gospel.
[00:51:23.480 --> 00:51:24.980]   And after they preach the gospel,
[00:51:24.980 --> 00:51:26.980]   they themselves are disqualified.
[00:51:26.980 --> 00:51:29.480]   They don't get to partake in the blessings of the gospel
[00:51:29.480 --> 00:51:31.980]   that they just gave.
[00:51:31.980 --> 00:51:34.980]   And so I'm not sure if you've ever heard preachers use this
[00:51:34.980 --> 00:51:36.980]   and say, yeah, so don't be the hypocrites who
[00:51:36.980 --> 00:51:39.480]   go out on preaching, but you're really empty shells.
[00:51:39.480 --> 00:51:41.480]   And they'll quote this passage saying,
[00:51:41.480 --> 00:51:44.480]   see, Apostle Paul says, after I preach, I'm disqualified.
[00:51:44.480 --> 00:51:46.480]   Some people use the passage like that.
[00:51:46.480 --> 00:51:49.480]   And then there are people who think that because of the fact
[00:51:49.480 --> 00:51:53.480]   that he's talking about joining in--
[00:51:53.480 --> 00:51:57.480]   he uses the word of being a partaker in the previous verses,
[00:51:57.480 --> 00:51:58.980]   and he uses that.
[00:51:58.980 --> 00:52:02.980]   I personally, personally think that, yeah,
[00:52:02.980 --> 00:52:06.480]   he is talking about his personal witness,
[00:52:06.480 --> 00:52:11.480]   that he's talking about the fact that he's
[00:52:11.480 --> 00:52:17.480]   using a sports analogy for Christians who are in it,
[00:52:17.480 --> 00:52:19.480]   but who aren't in it to win it.
[00:52:19.480 --> 00:52:22.480]   He's using a sports analogy to talk about those individuals who
[00:52:22.480 --> 00:52:25.480]   are also disqualified from competition.
[00:52:25.480 --> 00:52:28.480]   And there's a sense in which, in keeping with that whole idea,
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:31.480]   yeah, there are people in context back then--
[00:52:31.480 --> 00:52:34.480]   the Olympics were actually huge during this time
[00:52:34.480 --> 00:52:36.480]   that he's writing.
[00:52:36.480 --> 00:52:39.480]   In the first century, the Olympic Games were huge.
[00:52:39.480 --> 00:52:44.480]   But it was more severe, crazier sports,
[00:52:44.480 --> 00:52:47.480]   and the restrictions were also more intense,
[00:52:47.480 --> 00:52:50.480]   meaning you literally had to be a special class individual.
[00:52:50.480 --> 00:52:52.480]   You were like a brand.
[00:52:52.480 --> 00:52:54.480]   And if you can think, like today, the sports people
[00:52:54.480 --> 00:52:55.480]   have managers.
[00:52:55.480 --> 00:52:58.480]   Basically, back then, they had manager masters.
[00:52:58.480 --> 00:53:01.480]   And they would basically have these sports athletes train.
[00:53:01.480 --> 00:53:04.480]   They would train for almost a solid year.
[00:53:04.480 --> 00:53:06.480]   And through that whole year, they'd
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.480]   put them to a gauntlet of different exercises.
[00:53:08.480 --> 00:53:11.480]   And if they failed any of those exercises, what would happen?
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:13.480]   They wouldn't be allowed to compete.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:16.480]   And there's an element in which Apostle Paul,
[00:53:16.480 --> 00:53:18.480]   back in the first part of chapter 9,
[00:53:18.480 --> 00:53:21.480]   he viewed himself as someone who has a stewardship
[00:53:21.480 --> 00:53:23.480]   by the master to preach.
[00:53:23.480 --> 00:53:25.480]   And he says, woe is me if I don't preach,
[00:53:25.480 --> 00:53:27.480]   because I have a stewardship, and I have to give
[00:53:27.480 --> 00:53:29.480]   an account of the stewardship.
[00:53:29.480 --> 00:53:33.480]   And there's an element in which he's fearful that should there
[00:53:33.480 --> 00:53:38.480]   be the lack of discipline, should there
[00:53:38.480 --> 00:53:41.480]   be a lack of self-control, should there be any of this,
[00:53:41.480 --> 00:53:43.480]   that he might be disqualified from the stewardship
[00:53:43.480 --> 00:53:44.480]   that he has.
[00:53:44.480 --> 00:53:45.480]   That's my personal take on it.
[00:53:45.480 --> 00:53:47.480]   But I want to let you know, again,
[00:53:47.480 --> 00:53:48.480]   there are good and godly people who
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:50.480]   disagree about this passage.
[00:53:50.480 --> 00:53:51.480]   OK?
[00:53:51.480 --> 00:53:52.480]   All right.
[00:53:52.480 --> 00:53:57.480]   But in thinking about that, I want to conclude with this.
[00:53:57.480 --> 00:54:02.480]   There is an element in which today's lesson is like,
[00:54:02.480 --> 00:54:05.480]   I wanted to make it motivational for you guys.
[00:54:05.480 --> 00:54:08.480]   Because Apostle Paul is essentially being a coach.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:10.480]   He's like, hey, big huddle.
[00:54:10.480 --> 00:54:12.480]   Everybody in the huddle.
[00:54:12.480 --> 00:54:14.480]   Do you want to win?
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:17.480]   What do you want?
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:20.480]   Do you know what we're in here for?
[00:54:20.480 --> 00:54:22.480]   Have you trained?
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:23.480]   That's what he's asking.
[00:54:23.480 --> 00:54:26.480]   Have you trained?
[00:54:26.480 --> 00:54:28.480]   Everything you've invested, all that time
[00:54:28.480 --> 00:54:30.480]   you'd spent learning, attending Bible studies,
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:33.480]   sacrificing, meeting up with people, getting discipled,
[00:54:33.480 --> 00:54:35.480]   this is what we need to practice it.
[00:54:35.480 --> 00:54:36.480]   He's being a coach right now.
[00:54:36.480 --> 00:54:37.480]   Right?
[00:54:37.480 --> 00:54:40.480]   And there's an element to which I want to highlight, too.
[00:54:40.480 --> 00:54:44.480]   It's not necessarily stated in this passage.
[00:54:44.480 --> 00:54:45.480]   But here's a fact.
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:47.480]   He's using a sports analogy.
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:49.480]   And I want to use an Olympic athlete.
[00:54:49.480 --> 00:54:50.480]   OK?
[00:54:50.480 --> 00:54:53.480]   Did you know that there is a lady who
[00:54:53.480 --> 00:54:57.480]   holds the Olympic world record for most appearances
[00:54:57.480 --> 00:54:59.480]   in the Olympic games?
[00:54:59.480 --> 00:55:02.480]   Olympics are held only every four years.
[00:55:02.480 --> 00:55:03.480]   So you can imagine.
[00:55:03.480 --> 00:55:06.480]   You can compete only a certain number of times.
[00:55:06.480 --> 00:55:07.480]   And that number is eight.
[00:55:07.480 --> 00:55:10.480]   She made eight appearances in the Olympics.
[00:55:10.480 --> 00:55:11.480]   Isn't that crazy?
[00:55:11.480 --> 00:55:13.480]   She was a canoeing person.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.480]   And you look at all these Olympic records
[00:55:15.480 --> 00:55:17.480]   for a number of appearances and saw these sports
[00:55:17.480 --> 00:55:20.480]   like equestrian, stuff that you can do for a long time.
[00:55:20.480 --> 00:55:23.480]   But for your average athlete, you can imagine.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:26.480]   How many times do you think the average athlete
[00:55:26.480 --> 00:55:29.480]   appears in the Olympics?
[00:55:29.480 --> 00:55:32.480]   Yeah, once.
[00:55:32.480 --> 00:55:34.480]   Once.
[00:55:34.480 --> 00:55:37.480]   Just because there's so many people competing
[00:55:37.480 --> 00:55:39.480]   just for that Olympic spot.
[00:55:39.480 --> 00:55:42.480]   To represent your country one time for a lot of--
[00:55:42.480 --> 00:55:44.480]   maybe in the US it's not as grand, US and LA,
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:45.480]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:55:45.480 --> 00:55:48.480]   But for every other country, you represent your country one time
[00:55:48.480 --> 00:55:52.480]   and you're like a hero of your city, right?
[00:55:52.480 --> 00:55:54.480]   Well, think about this for a moment.
[00:55:54.480 --> 00:55:57.480]   She's sitting here saying, "Run like you should win."
[00:55:57.480 --> 00:55:59.480]   Can I add the element?
[00:55:59.480 --> 00:56:01.480]   You really only have one shot?
[00:56:01.480 --> 00:56:04.480]   You two truly only have one life to live?
[00:56:04.480 --> 00:56:07.480]   Did you know Jesus Christ had this same mentality?
[00:56:07.480 --> 00:56:09.480]   John chapter 9, verse 4 through 5.
[00:56:09.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   John chapter 9, verse 4 through 5.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:15.480]   "We must work the works of Him who sent me.
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   "As long as it is day, but night is coming
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:23.480]   "when no man can work."
[00:56:23.480 --> 00:56:27.480]   I was so tempted to write down Eminem's lyrics.
[00:56:27.480 --> 00:56:30.480]   [laughter]
[00:56:30.480 --> 00:56:33.480]   He's actually a pretty good poet.
[00:56:33.480 --> 00:56:37.480]   But the command today, motivationally, is,
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:40.480]   "Seriously, you have one life to live.
[00:56:40.480 --> 00:56:42.480]   "You're in this race.
[00:56:42.480 --> 00:56:45.480]   "Are you running like you want to win?
[00:56:45.480 --> 00:56:48.480]   "Or have you gotten so accustomed to being
[00:56:48.480 --> 00:56:50.480]   "in the Christian environment, it's just kind of like
[00:56:50.480 --> 00:56:52.480]   "you're being moved by the rest of your team,
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:54.480]   "but you're not really pulling your weight?
[00:56:54.480 --> 00:56:56.480]   "Have you lost sight of the ambition?
[00:56:56.480 --> 00:56:59.480]   "No, I really want to attain that prize.
[00:56:59.480 --> 00:57:02.480]   "Or have you latched on to little side ambitions?
[00:57:02.480 --> 00:57:05.480]   "No, I want to stand out amongst my friends.
[00:57:05.480 --> 00:57:07.480]   "I want to accomplish big things in this life.
[00:57:07.480 --> 00:57:08.480]   "I want to have lots of money.
[00:57:08.480 --> 00:57:10.480]   "I want to have lots of this and lots of that."
[00:57:10.480 --> 00:57:14.480]   And you just latched on to little personal agendas,
[00:57:14.480 --> 00:57:16.480]   like you would see perhaps in basketball
[00:57:16.480 --> 00:57:18.480]   or whatever it may be.
[00:57:18.480 --> 00:57:23.480]   Apostle Paul says, "Run in a way that you should win the prize."
[00:57:23.480 --> 00:57:25.480]   So that's our lesson for today,
[00:57:25.480 --> 00:57:27.480]   and then we're going to tackle next week
[00:57:27.480 --> 00:57:30.480]   Apostle Paul's warning of those who've lost sight of that.
[00:57:30.480 --> 00:57:34.480]   Let's pray.
[00:57:34.480 --> 00:57:38.480]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you.
[00:57:38.480 --> 00:57:42.480]   God, in our generation, Lord,
[00:57:42.480 --> 00:57:46.480]   we do realize we only have one life to live.
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.480]   So there is huge motivation then
[00:57:48.480 --> 00:57:51.480]   to take in all that the world has to offer.
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:53.480]   But God, we realize from your scripture
[00:57:53.480 --> 00:57:57.480]   that actually we need to exercise even greater self-control,
[00:57:57.480 --> 00:58:00.480]   that we would be willing to deny ourselves,
[00:58:00.480 --> 00:58:04.480]   that we would be willing to limit ourselves,
[00:58:04.480 --> 00:58:06.480]   in this all-purpose of love.
[00:58:06.480 --> 00:58:09.480]   God, love for you, love for the people.
[00:58:09.480 --> 00:58:14.480]   I pray, Father God, that if any of us have been just distracted,
[00:58:14.480 --> 00:58:17.480]   just distracted by the common things like work,
[00:58:17.480 --> 00:58:19.480]   I pray you give us wisdom and inspiration.
[00:58:19.480 --> 00:58:22.480]   If some of us just got tired or just way too fatigued,
[00:58:22.480 --> 00:58:25.480]   I pray you give us strength through your spirit.
[00:58:25.480 --> 00:58:28.480]   If some of us have lost sight of the end goal,
[00:58:28.480 --> 00:58:31.480]   I pray, God, that your word would light a path,
[00:58:31.480 --> 00:58:34.480]   and God, that we would see very clearly what you desire for us.
[00:58:34.480 --> 00:58:38.480]   And God, we all recognize that we have a great hurdle,
[00:58:38.480 --> 00:58:39.480]   which is ourselves.
[00:58:39.480 --> 00:58:43.480]   And I pray, Father God, that we would, just as Apostle Paul did,
[00:58:43.480 --> 00:58:45.480]   learn to discipline our bodies,
[00:58:45.480 --> 00:58:47.480]   continue to strive against the flesh,
[00:58:47.480 --> 00:58:51.480]   and, Lord, desire to offer up to you everything that we have.
[00:58:51.480 --> 00:58:52.480]   God, we thank you.
[00:58:52.480 --> 00:58:54.480]   We pray that you would be with us this week
[00:58:54.480 --> 00:58:56.480]   as we desire to apply all that we're learning.
[00:58:56.480 --> 00:58:58.480]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
