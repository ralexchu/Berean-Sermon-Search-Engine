[00:04:00.160 --> 00:04:07.020]   - All right, good morning, church family,
[00:04:07.020 --> 00:04:08.020]   and happy Lord's Day.
[00:04:08.020 --> 00:04:10.340]   Hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:04:10.340 --> 00:04:12.840]   This morning, I'd like to read from Psalm 95.
[00:04:12.840 --> 00:04:15.860]   And this is the Word of God.
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:19.500]   O come, let us sing for joy to the Lord.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:22.820]   Let us shout joyfully to the rock of our salvation.
[00:04:22.820 --> 00:04:25.580]   Let us come before his presence with thanksgiving.
[00:04:25.580 --> 00:04:28.260]   Let us shout joyfully to him with psalms.
[00:04:28.260 --> 00:04:30.140]   For the Lord is a great God,
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:32.180]   and a great King above all gods,
[00:04:32.180 --> 00:04:35.060]   and whose hand are the depths of the earth.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:37.580]   The peaks of the mountains are his also.
[00:04:37.580 --> 00:04:40.660]   The sea is his, for it was he who made it,
[00:04:40.660 --> 00:04:43.100]   and his hands formed the dry land.
[00:04:43.100 --> 00:04:45.820]   Come, let us worship and bow down.
[00:04:45.820 --> 00:04:48.300]   Let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker.
[00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.940]   For he is our God, and we are the people of his pasture,
[00:04:51.940 --> 00:04:54.060]   and the sheep of his hand.
[00:04:54.060 --> 00:04:55.300]   So this morning, may these verses
[00:04:55.300 --> 00:04:56.740]   serve as our call to worship.
[00:04:56.740 --> 00:05:00.940]   (gentle piano music)

[00:09:16.220 --> 00:09:17.980]   Welcome to Berean Community Church.
[00:09:17.980 --> 00:09:22.700]   I have just two announcements for our newer people,
[00:09:22.700 --> 00:09:24.460]   and then I have two announcements
[00:09:24.460 --> 00:09:27.660]   for just the current members of the church.
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:31.140]   If you are a new person, a new visitor,
[00:09:31.140 --> 00:09:32.660]   we have a welcome lunch.
[00:09:32.660 --> 00:09:34.220]   It happens quarterly,
[00:09:34.220 --> 00:09:38.580]   and it's gonna be across the way in the Youth Chapel,
[00:09:38.580 --> 00:09:40.020]   which is literally just across the way
[00:09:40.020 --> 00:09:42.160]   next to the cafe at one o'clock.
[00:09:42.160 --> 00:09:45.060]   And there, we'll just explain to you
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:46.580]   just our visions for the church.
[00:09:46.580 --> 00:09:47.820]   We'll be able to meet some of the leaders
[00:09:47.820 --> 00:09:48.660]   and some of the members.
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:51.900]   So if you're brand new, or you know someone brand new,
[00:09:51.900 --> 00:09:55.660]   usher them that way, and we'll take good care of them.
[00:09:55.660 --> 00:09:58.480]   Lunch will be provided, and that's at one o'clock today.
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:01.060]   And if you are new, we are a church
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.460]   that practices membership,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:05.340]   and our membership class is eight weeks,
[00:10:05.340 --> 00:10:06.420]   where it's very thorough.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:09.300]   We explain to you everything that our church is about
[00:10:09.300 --> 00:10:10.580]   and what we stand for,
[00:10:10.580 --> 00:10:13.060]   and so that your eyes are wide open
[00:10:13.060 --> 00:10:14.100]   when you're coming in, right?
[00:10:14.100 --> 00:10:17.260]   And so that membership class will start July 7th,
[00:10:17.260 --> 00:10:18.660]   which is next Sunday,
[00:10:18.660 --> 00:10:22.260]   and it's always at 9.30 to 10.45.
[00:10:22.260 --> 00:10:24.240]   So it'll be during this service,
[00:10:24.240 --> 00:10:25.580]   but that's also gonna be happening
[00:10:25.580 --> 00:10:28.240]   in the Youth Chapel, 9.30, starting next Sunday.
[00:10:28.240 --> 00:10:30.240]   So if you know somebody who's brand new,
[00:10:31.200 --> 00:10:32.880]   and they wanna become a member,
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:34.600]   point them in that direction, okay?
[00:10:34.600 --> 00:10:37.520]   And then for the members of the church,
[00:10:37.520 --> 00:10:40.040]   we have a members meeting that is coming up
[00:10:40.040 --> 00:10:41.480]   on Sunday, July 28th.
[00:10:41.480 --> 00:10:42.840]   It's at two o'clock.
[00:10:42.840 --> 00:10:47.840]   Our Taiwan missions team will be providing lunch for a fee.
[00:10:47.840 --> 00:10:50.000]   It's a fundraiser lunch,
[00:10:50.000 --> 00:10:52.360]   so that they could raise funds for their trip,
[00:10:52.360 --> 00:10:53.900]   so you don't have to leave the campus.
[00:10:53.900 --> 00:10:56.480]   But two o'clock is when we're gonna start,
[00:10:56.480 --> 00:10:59.700]   so please do make time for that,
[00:10:59.700 --> 00:11:01.600]   that there's gonna be a lot of important announcements
[00:11:01.600 --> 00:11:03.680]   that come up in the July members meeting.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:06.280]   And also, if you are a member,
[00:11:06.280 --> 00:11:08.680]   and you're gonna be working with kids at our church
[00:11:08.680 --> 00:11:10.920]   at some point, whether it's the VBS,
[00:11:10.920 --> 00:11:12.200]   which is happening in a couple weeks,
[00:11:12.200 --> 00:11:16.920]   or down the line, we require you to be safety trained.
[00:11:16.920 --> 00:11:19.400]   And so that's gonna be happening next week
[00:11:19.400 --> 00:11:21.360]   in the afternoon as well.
[00:11:21.360 --> 00:11:24.140]   So kinda keep that in mind.
[00:11:24.140 --> 00:11:26.660]   Right now, we're gonna take a time of offering.
[00:11:26.660 --> 00:11:31.440]   If you're providing your offering to the Lord physically,
[00:11:31.440 --> 00:11:32.800]   there is a box in the back.
[00:11:32.800 --> 00:11:36.560]   Otherwise, you can just give electronically.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:38.840]   But let me go ahead and pray for our offering,
[00:11:38.840 --> 00:11:41.880]   and then we'll continue our service.
[00:11:41.880 --> 00:11:43.640]   Heavenly Father, we're very grateful
[00:11:43.640 --> 00:11:48.640]   that you've gathered us here to worship.
[00:11:48.640 --> 00:11:51.320]   And we acknowledge this morning,
[00:11:51.320 --> 00:11:54.280]   Father, you are the reason why we're here.
[00:11:54.280 --> 00:11:56.560]   And I pray that you would remind us afresh
[00:11:56.560 --> 00:12:00.160]   of why we worship and who it is that we worship.
[00:12:00.160 --> 00:12:03.560]   And as you've given us all good things to steward,
[00:12:03.560 --> 00:12:06.160]   I pray that as we give our offering,
[00:12:06.160 --> 00:12:09.320]   we wouldn't just give just monetarily,
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:11.200]   but Lord, our affections and our hearts
[00:12:11.200 --> 00:12:13.800]   would be there as well.
[00:12:13.800 --> 00:12:15.960]   Lord, you are God.
[00:12:15.960 --> 00:12:18.720]   And we ask, Lord, that you would be magnified
[00:12:18.720 --> 00:12:21.600]   in every element and aspect of our worship today.
[00:12:21.600 --> 00:12:22.960]   I pray this in Jesus' name.

[00:21:10.740 --> 00:21:30.840]   - All right.
[00:21:30.840 --> 00:21:34.920]   Today, we're gonna be looking at all of Psalm 19.
[00:21:34.920 --> 00:21:36.360]   So if you have your Bibles,
[00:21:36.360 --> 00:21:38.800]   please turn to Psalm 19,
[00:21:38.800 --> 00:21:42.800]   and I'll read for us verses 11 to 14.
[00:21:42.800 --> 00:21:46.240]   Okay, Psalm 19, 11 to 14.
[00:21:46.240 --> 00:21:52.520]   It reads, "Moreover, by them your servant is warned.
[00:21:52.520 --> 00:21:55.500]   "In keeping them, there is great reward.
[00:21:55.500 --> 00:21:57.860]   "Who can discern his errors?
[00:21:57.860 --> 00:22:00.960]   "Equip me of hidden faults.
[00:22:00.960 --> 00:22:05.260]   "Also keep back your servant from presumptuous sins.
[00:22:05.260 --> 00:22:07.740]   "Let them not rule over me.
[00:22:07.740 --> 00:22:09.940]   "Then I will be blameless,
[00:22:09.940 --> 00:22:12.840]   "and I shall be acquitted of great transgression.
[00:22:12.840 --> 00:22:15.960]   "Let the words of my mouth
[00:22:15.960 --> 00:22:18.220]   "and the meditation of my heart
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.300]   "be acceptable in your sight,
[00:22:20.300 --> 00:22:23.680]   "O Lord, my rock and my redeemer."
[00:22:23.680 --> 00:22:24.720]   Let us pray together.
[00:22:24.720 --> 00:22:32.200]   Heavenly Father, we ask that you would lead us in worship
[00:22:33.240 --> 00:22:37.020]   in this hour, would you protect the pulpit,
[00:22:37.020 --> 00:22:41.220]   and would you use the proclamation of your word
[00:22:41.220 --> 00:22:44.580]   to truly bring honor and glory to you.
[00:22:44.580 --> 00:22:48.960]   A lot of words have been prepared,
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:52.260]   but it's just human craftiness
[00:22:52.260 --> 00:22:54.900]   if it's not with your unction and your spirit.
[00:22:54.900 --> 00:22:59.020]   So we pray that you would take the center stage
[00:22:59.020 --> 00:23:01.400]   and preach your truth to your sheep.
[00:23:02.980 --> 00:23:05.300]   And as we hear your word, and as we feed,
[00:23:05.300 --> 00:23:07.460]   and as we drink upon your truths,
[00:23:07.460 --> 00:23:10.500]   I pray that you would bear fruit in our lives,
[00:23:10.500 --> 00:23:14.260]   again, to magnify and honor you.
[00:23:14.260 --> 00:23:16.500]   So we pray that you would guide our time,
[00:23:16.500 --> 00:23:22.600]   give us sober spirits, give us alert minds this morning.
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:25.020]   I pray this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:23:25.020 --> 00:23:31.260]   So my wife, Becky, and I started formally dating
[00:23:31.260 --> 00:23:36.260]   in January 2004, January 18th to be exact.
[00:23:36.260 --> 00:23:40.460]   So less than one month into our dating relationship,
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:42.980]   there was a Valentine's Day
[00:23:42.980 --> 00:23:45.380]   that I felt the need to prepare for.
[00:23:45.380 --> 00:23:47.140]   So perhaps sensing a little bit of stress
[00:23:47.140 --> 00:23:50.500]   coming from my end, Becky being the sweet
[00:23:50.500 --> 00:23:53.940]   and considerate person that she is, she suggested,
[00:23:53.940 --> 00:23:57.800]   you know, Valentine's Day, it's such a silly holiday.
[00:23:57.800 --> 00:24:00.220]   It's a fake holiday created by Hallmark,
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:01.540]   florists, and chocolatiers.
[00:24:01.540 --> 00:24:04.740]   Peter, you don't need to do anything.
[00:24:04.740 --> 00:24:08.300]   And I immediately felt like this was either
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.540]   a test or a trap.
[00:24:10.540 --> 00:24:14.120]   And I asked her, are you sure?
[00:24:14.120 --> 00:24:18.100]   To which she emphatically replied, and I quote,
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:21.260]   "Yes, we don't need to do anything.
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:24.260]   "Let's not do anything."
[00:24:24.260 --> 00:24:28.420]   So being the naive, trusting simpleton that I am,
[00:24:28.420 --> 00:24:31.800]   when Valentine's Day rolled around a few weeks later,
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:32.700]   I did nothing.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.460]   And I remember this day very well.
[00:24:36.460 --> 00:24:39.860]   Valentine's Day fell on Saturday that year.
[00:24:39.860 --> 00:24:41.940]   And that morning, Becky called me and asked me
[00:24:41.940 --> 00:24:43.700]   what I was going to do that day.
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.460]   And I told her I had to finish up my sermon,
[00:24:46.460 --> 00:24:49.140]   that I was planning on running errands in the afternoon,
[00:24:49.140 --> 00:24:51.540]   and that maybe we can grab dinner afterwards.
[00:24:51.540 --> 00:24:53.660]   So she came over.
[00:24:53.660 --> 00:24:55.700]   And the final errand was shopping
[00:24:55.700 --> 00:24:57.000]   at a Korean grocery market.
[00:24:57.000 --> 00:25:01.660]   And then we just grabbed a quick dinner at the food court.
[00:25:01.660 --> 00:25:03.900]   And then I think it dawned on her
[00:25:03.900 --> 00:25:05.680]   that I had really prepped nothing.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:08.580]   I had planned nothing.
[00:25:08.580 --> 00:25:11.620]   That we were literally only going to run errands together
[00:25:11.620 --> 00:25:13.160]   and eat food court food.
[00:25:13.160 --> 00:25:16.840]   And at the end of the day, when I walked her to her car,
[00:25:16.840 --> 00:25:20.580]   she handed me a card that she had written in,
[00:25:20.580 --> 00:25:22.060]   and then teared up a little bit.
[00:25:22.060 --> 00:25:25.960]   And I think she was surprised and a bit hurt
[00:25:25.960 --> 00:25:28.840]   that I literally did nothing.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.300]   So here's a public service announcement, brothers.
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:32.620]   (audience laughing)
[00:25:32.620 --> 00:25:35.920]   If a lady says to you, "You don't need to plan anything,"
[00:25:35.920 --> 00:25:37.940]   that's secret girl talk,
[00:25:37.940 --> 00:25:39.740]   for you should still plan something.
[00:25:39.740 --> 00:25:42.660]   Anyhow, in the following year, I wisened up.
[00:25:42.660 --> 00:25:44.300]   I knew I had to do something to make up
[00:25:44.300 --> 00:25:47.020]   for the previous Valentine's Day debacle.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:51.060]   So I had to at least give her a nice, thoughtful gift.
[00:25:51.060 --> 00:25:54.020]   And having dated her at that point for about 13 months,
[00:25:54.020 --> 00:25:58.580]   I felt I knew exactly what she, my girlfriend, would want.
[00:25:58.580 --> 00:26:00.860]   You see, I had been making observations and taking notes
[00:26:00.860 --> 00:26:02.700]   and becoming an expert on all that is Becky.
[00:26:02.700 --> 00:26:05.700]   So 13 months, I noticed that Becky tried
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.140]   to be health-conscious in her eating.
[00:26:08.140 --> 00:26:11.340]   So no chocolates for Valentine's Day.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:13.360]   I observed also that she was pretty frugal
[00:26:13.360 --> 00:26:15.740]   and didn't like spending money on frivolous things
[00:26:15.740 --> 00:26:17.660]   and on things that didn't last.
[00:26:17.660 --> 00:26:19.860]   So no flowers since they die pretty quickly.
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:24.120]   So with absolute confidence in my knowledge of her,
[00:26:24.120 --> 00:26:26.180]   I made my way to Target,
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:29.320]   and I bought Becky a nice exercise ball.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:30.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:30.700 --> 00:26:33.700]   A health-conscious gift, an economic gift.
[00:26:33.700 --> 00:26:37.080]   And to my astonishment,
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:40.540]   the exercise ball was not well-received
[00:26:40.540 --> 00:26:42.380]   on this second Valentine's Day.
[00:26:42.380 --> 00:26:45.420]   And Valentine's Day number three came around,
[00:26:45.420 --> 00:26:47.820]   and at a few weeks before this third Valentine's Day,
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.820]   Becky sat me down, looked straight in my eyes,
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:55.380]   and said, "My favorite flowers are peonies.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:56.500]   (audience laughing)
[00:26:56.500 --> 00:27:00.160]   "I like Ferrero Rocher three-pack.
[00:27:00.160 --> 00:27:02.440]   "Here is a card.
[00:27:02.440 --> 00:27:04.480]   "Write something nice in it.
[00:27:04.480 --> 00:27:08.020]   "Perhaps include a nice, meaningful Bible verse."
[00:27:08.020 --> 00:27:10.020]   So she spelled it out for me,
[00:27:10.020 --> 00:27:14.980]   and she gave me explicit and easy-to-follow instructions.
[00:27:14.980 --> 00:27:16.980]   She left nothing to guesswork.
[00:27:16.980 --> 00:27:19.980]   She left nothing to chance.
[00:27:19.980 --> 00:27:22.780]   And we have since celebrated 18 additional Valentine's Day,
[00:27:22.780 --> 00:27:26.980]   and since then, I believe I've done objectively well.
[00:27:26.980 --> 00:27:31.260]   Valentine's Day does not upset my wife anymore.
[00:27:31.260 --> 00:27:34.680]   Since then, I have not once done nothing.
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.620]   There are always flowers on Valentine's Day.
[00:27:36.620 --> 00:27:38.420]   There's always a card.
[00:27:38.420 --> 00:27:39.920]   And I think it's been a combination
[00:27:39.920 --> 00:27:41.620]   of her lowered expectations,
[00:27:41.620 --> 00:27:44.460]   my growth and understanding of my wife's heart,
[00:27:44.460 --> 00:27:47.380]   and overall improvement in communication.
[00:27:47.380 --> 00:27:49.300]   So you see, the problem early on
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.840]   was that Becky assumed I could read her mind.
[00:27:52.840 --> 00:27:56.500]   But she learned quickly that I'm pretty dense,
[00:27:56.500 --> 00:27:58.940]   that I could not read her mind,
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:00.580]   and over the past 20 years,
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:05.500]   she's left less and less of our relationship to guesswork.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:07.500]   So here's a second public service announcement.
[00:28:07.500 --> 00:28:11.080]   Sisters, if you want to leave it to chance and guesswork,
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:13.740]   you are setting yourself up for disappointment
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:17.140]   because we men will pretty much guess
[00:28:17.140 --> 00:28:20.980]   incorrectly 100% of the time.
[00:28:20.980 --> 00:28:23.140]   Amen?
[00:28:23.140 --> 00:28:24.060]   All right.
[00:28:24.060 --> 00:28:25.740]   I don't know if you should amen to that.
[00:28:25.740 --> 00:28:29.260]   And some of you guys are wise, you just kept it closed.
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.620]   On this side of eternity, most of our relationships,
[00:28:32.620 --> 00:28:34.700]   and I'm not just talking about romantic relationships,
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:37.740]   they require some degree of guesswork.
[00:28:37.740 --> 00:28:40.880]   Many relationships require some trial and error,
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:43.180]   and then some adjustments.
[00:28:43.180 --> 00:28:45.060]   And on this side of eternity, because of sin,
[00:28:45.060 --> 00:28:49.140]   no matter how intimate a relationship between two people,
[00:28:49.140 --> 00:28:53.700]   communication will always be corrupted and flawed.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:57.460]   And no matter how deep a love shared between two parties,
[00:28:57.460 --> 00:29:00.260]   it's inevitable that someone will misspeak
[00:29:00.260 --> 00:29:02.820]   and that someone will mishear,
[00:29:02.820 --> 00:29:05.120]   and there will always be miscommunication.
[00:29:05.120 --> 00:29:10.580]   And sin and words spoken in and through sin
[00:29:10.580 --> 00:29:12.100]   separate people.
[00:29:13.020 --> 00:29:15.260]   They always separate.
[00:29:15.260 --> 00:29:18.240]   They always drive a wedge into every relationship.
[00:29:18.240 --> 00:29:21.740]   Our speaking is broken.
[00:29:21.740 --> 00:29:24.220]   Our hearing is broken.
[00:29:24.220 --> 00:29:26.220]   Our understanding is limited.
[00:29:26.220 --> 00:29:30.340]   Our biases and our prejudices are strong.
[00:29:30.340 --> 00:29:35.240]   Our judgment is often imperfect and reckless.
[00:29:35.240 --> 00:29:38.080]   We are all broken and our communication is broken.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.500]   The fall of man and the entrance of sin into the world
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.060]   didn't just damage human relationships,
[00:29:44.060 --> 00:29:46.820]   but it also greatly corrupted man's understanding
[00:29:46.820 --> 00:29:47.920]   of the things of God.
[00:29:47.920 --> 00:29:52.420]   Man's sins separate him from his creator.
[00:29:52.420 --> 00:29:56.080]   And unlike sinful and corrupted man,
[00:29:56.080 --> 00:30:01.080]   however, God is incorruptible, God is perfect.
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:04.740]   There is no trace of sin or unrighteousness in God
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:07.500]   or in what he says.
[00:30:07.500 --> 00:30:10.620]   God is a perfect communicator.
[00:30:11.620 --> 00:30:15.160]   He has never miscommunicated.
[00:30:15.160 --> 00:30:19.780]   And we see in the scriptures that God does not lie
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.520]   and God cannot lie.
[00:30:21.520 --> 00:30:26.660]   Man may misspeak, man may mishear,
[00:30:26.660 --> 00:30:31.660]   man may miscommunicate, but this is not so with God.
[00:30:31.660 --> 00:30:35.940]   God never miscommunicates.
[00:30:35.940 --> 00:30:38.740]   God never misspeaks.
[00:30:38.740 --> 00:30:41.780]   He's always been explicit and absolutely clear
[00:30:41.780 --> 00:30:45.040]   in communicating what he desires all people to know.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:48.660]   And because our God is the same yesterday, today,
[00:30:48.660 --> 00:30:52.980]   and forever, we know that he will continue to be explicit
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:55.460]   and absolutely clear in communicating
[00:30:55.460 --> 00:30:57.540]   what he desires all people to know.
[00:30:57.540 --> 00:31:01.140]   In Micah chapter six, verse eight, it reads,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:05.540]   he has told you, oh man, what is good.
[00:31:05.540 --> 00:31:09.020]   And what does the Lord require of you but to do justice,
[00:31:09.020 --> 00:31:13.180]   to love, loving kindness, and to walk humbly with your God.
[00:31:13.180 --> 00:31:18.180]   Some translations will read, he has shown you, oh man.
[00:31:18.180 --> 00:31:23.700]   The Hebrew word here is higith, which is a very rich verb,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:27.260]   referring to a very clear telling.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:31.280]   So clear that it's almost equivalent to a showing.
[00:31:31.280 --> 00:31:35.520]   So the telling is so clear that you can almost see it.
[00:31:35.520 --> 00:31:37.560]   So here's the feel of this verse.
[00:31:37.560 --> 00:31:42.040]   He has, he gith you, oh man, what is good,
[00:31:42.040 --> 00:31:44.520]   and what does the Lord require of you?
[00:31:44.520 --> 00:31:48.240]   So God never leaves his will to guesswork.
[00:31:48.240 --> 00:31:51.800]   He never calls his people to guess what he's thinking
[00:31:51.800 --> 00:31:54.040]   or what he requires.
[00:31:54.040 --> 00:31:56.800]   God's will for you and for me is very clear,
[00:31:56.800 --> 00:31:59.060]   it's very explicit.
[00:31:59.060 --> 00:32:01.300]   And this has always been the case,
[00:32:01.300 --> 00:32:03.520]   and this will always be the case.
[00:32:03.520 --> 00:32:07.520]   The specific application of his will for our lives
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:11.700]   may differ in appearance or how it all unfolds,
[00:32:11.700 --> 00:32:16.300]   but God's will has, is, and always will be the same.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:20.940]   And broadly speaking, it is not difficult
[00:32:20.940 --> 00:32:23.980]   to discern the will of God for our lives.
[00:32:23.980 --> 00:32:27.200]   The problem is not in the clarity of God's communication,
[00:32:27.200 --> 00:32:31.700]   the problem lies in our not liking his will,
[00:32:31.700 --> 00:32:36.240]   rebelliously rejecting it, and then asking for another will.
[00:32:36.240 --> 00:32:39.460]   And we see through the scriptures
[00:32:39.460 --> 00:32:43.000]   that God's communication may be veiled.
[00:32:43.000 --> 00:32:46.660]   And in the instances that it is veiled,
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.100]   it's veiled only to those who are perishing,
[00:32:49.100 --> 00:32:50.640]   2 Corinthians 4:3.
[00:32:50.640 --> 00:32:54.580]   It's confused because unregenerate minds
[00:32:54.580 --> 00:32:56.300]   are blinded and deluded.
[00:32:57.280 --> 00:33:00.320]   And when God does speak in mysteries and parables,
[00:33:00.320 --> 00:33:03.440]   Luke 8, 10, he does so to those
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.420]   who have already hardened their hearts towards him,
[00:33:06.420 --> 00:33:09.320]   so that seeing they may not see,
[00:33:09.320 --> 00:33:11.480]   and hearing they may not understand.
[00:33:11.480 --> 00:33:14.920]   So God always speaks clearly,
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:18.480]   and he always proclaims his truths clearly,
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   and in his speaking and in his proclaiming,
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.960]   he magnifies and glorifies himself
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:27.380]   in and through all of his creation,
[00:33:27.380 --> 00:33:29.740]   and in and through all of his people.
[00:33:29.740 --> 00:33:33.100]   So God will make himself known.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:37.260]   That's the heartbeat of Psalm 19,
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:39.040]   which is our text for this morning.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:44.040]   God will make himself known, clearly.
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:47.900]   Psalm 19 is one of the most beloved
[00:33:47.900 --> 00:33:50.380]   of all of King David's psalms.
[00:33:50.380 --> 00:33:52.620]   C.S. Lewis has said of Psalm 19,
[00:33:52.620 --> 00:33:56.140]   "I take this to be the greatest poem in the Psalter,
[00:33:56.140 --> 00:33:59.780]   "and one of the greatest lyrics in all the world."
[00:33:59.780 --> 00:34:04.100]   It's basically a psalm delighting in God's self-disclosure
[00:34:04.100 --> 00:34:06.100]   to all of humanity.
[00:34:06.100 --> 00:34:09.760]   All 14 verses, which are organized in a chiastic structure,
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:13.860]   are telling and declaring of the works of God.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.540]   And in this psalm, I hope you will soon see,
[00:34:16.540 --> 00:34:21.020]   is also a very clear picture of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:34:21.020 --> 00:34:26.020]   Psalm 19 is a testimony of the gospel of God.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:27.180]   And so for this morning,
[00:34:27.180 --> 00:34:30.020]   I'm gonna walk us through all of Psalm 19.
[00:34:30.020 --> 00:34:32.580]   I'm gonna break it up into three bite-sized pieces,
[00:34:32.580 --> 00:34:35.460]   into bite-sized testimonies, okay?
[00:34:35.460 --> 00:34:38.340]   Remember, what's a testimony?
[00:34:38.340 --> 00:34:40.260]   Many modern-day church testimonies
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:43.500]   focus on how a person felt or what a person did,
[00:34:43.500 --> 00:34:45.940]   but by definition, the word testimony
[00:34:45.940 --> 00:34:50.940]   is a declaration of truth or fact given by a witness.
[00:34:51.760 --> 00:34:54.340]   You guys understand that, right?
[00:34:54.340 --> 00:34:57.980]   A testimony is a simple, factual telling
[00:34:57.980 --> 00:35:02.000]   of something one has seen or observed.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:04.420]   So we'll be looking at the three groups
[00:35:04.420 --> 00:35:09.420]   of testifying witnesses in Psalm 19 and their testimonies,
[00:35:09.420 --> 00:35:12.540]   all testifying to the nature of God
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:14.360]   and to the good news of God.
[00:35:14.360 --> 00:35:16.980]   Three witnesses declaring
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:20.440]   what they are seeing God proclaim, okay?
[00:35:20.440 --> 00:35:21.980]   So the outline of the passage
[00:35:21.980 --> 00:35:23.260]   and the outline of today's sermon
[00:35:23.260 --> 00:35:25.220]   will follow the thought flow
[00:35:25.220 --> 00:35:27.360]   of these three testimonies concerning God.
[00:35:27.360 --> 00:35:31.500]   First, we'll look at the testimony of the heavens,
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:33.660]   verses one through six,
[00:35:33.660 --> 00:35:37.700]   the testimony of the law, verses seven to 10,
[00:35:37.700 --> 00:35:41.940]   and the testimony of God's redeemed servant,
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.260]   verses 11 to 14.
[00:35:44.260 --> 00:35:47.280]   So that's the big picture, the broad outline.
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:50.560]   And before we jump in, I'd like to make a little note
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.360]   on the poetic books of the Bible.
[00:35:53.360 --> 00:35:54.880]   When we're studying through the scripture,
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.480]   sometimes the genre of the book will force you to adjust
[00:35:58.480 --> 00:36:01.240]   how you examine the verses in the book.
[00:36:01.240 --> 00:36:03.880]   With poetry, you don't need to analyze
[00:36:03.880 --> 00:36:06.640]   and assess every single detail given.
[00:36:06.640 --> 00:36:11.440]   In poetry, there are very few hidden meanings
[00:36:11.440 --> 00:36:12.680]   that you have to discern.
[00:36:12.680 --> 00:36:18.240]   Usually in poetry, the author is simply painting a picture
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.160]   with many words.
[00:36:20.160 --> 00:36:22.600]   So keep this in mind because for today's sermon,
[00:36:22.600 --> 00:36:25.000]   I'm not gonna be looking at every single word
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.480]   in each of the 14 verses, okay?
[00:36:27.480 --> 00:36:29.920]   So let's jump into King David's Psalm.
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:33.920]   It'll help for you to keep your Bibles open to Psalm 19.
[00:36:33.920 --> 00:36:38.920]   Verse one, the heavens are telling of the glory of God,
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:44.000]   and their expanse is declaring the work of his hands.
[00:36:44.000 --> 00:36:47.080]   So verse one is a summary statement
[00:36:47.080 --> 00:36:49.200]   of the majestic creator God.
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:52.700]   And the focus in this first half of the psalm
[00:36:52.700 --> 00:36:55.440]   is on God's creative power.
[00:36:55.440 --> 00:36:59.580]   The heavens and the expanse and all that it is contained
[00:36:59.580 --> 00:37:02.960]   within it are declaring God's glory.
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:06.720]   By the fiat of his power, God spoke the sun and the moon
[00:37:06.720 --> 00:37:09.880]   and the stars and the rest of creation into existence
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:12.640]   under this tent of the heavens.
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:14.740]   And the creative power of God was observable
[00:37:14.740 --> 00:37:17.640]   in the beginning, and it's still very observable
[00:37:17.640 --> 00:37:19.020]   for us today.
[00:37:19.020 --> 00:37:23.000]   So everything under the heavens and under this expanse
[00:37:23.000 --> 00:37:26.160]   are telling the glories of God.
[00:37:26.160 --> 00:37:27.920]   That's verse one.
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:32.920]   So verse two reads, day to day pours forth speech,
[00:37:32.920 --> 00:37:36.680]   and night to night reveals knowledge.
[00:37:36.680 --> 00:37:40.560]   There is no speech, nor are there words.
[00:37:40.560 --> 00:37:42.120]   Their voice is not heard.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:44.720]   So there's a paradox here.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:51.580]   There's a ton of speech without speech, without words.
[00:37:51.580 --> 00:37:58.260]   Day after day, all of creation is pouring forth speech.
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.860]   It's literally flooding with speech and declarations
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:05.460]   on the nature of God.
[00:38:05.460 --> 00:38:09.420]   Night to night is revealing and showing knowledge,
[00:38:09.420 --> 00:38:13.880]   and the nights also are doing this without words.
[00:38:13.880 --> 00:38:18.140]   These declarations are neither audible nor spoken,
[00:38:18.140 --> 00:38:20.820]   but on every fabric of creation,
[00:38:20.820 --> 00:38:24.280]   there is an imprint of the glory of God.
[00:38:24.280 --> 00:38:26.520]   God's fingerprints, so to speak,
[00:38:26.520 --> 00:38:28.820]   and his signatures are everywhere.
[00:38:28.820 --> 00:38:33.460]   And the knowledge of God and information about God
[00:38:33.460 --> 00:38:37.220]   is being declared through everything under the heavens,
[00:38:37.220 --> 00:38:38.800]   under this expanse.
[00:38:38.800 --> 00:38:40.540]   Okay, verse four.
[00:38:40.540 --> 00:38:43.000]   Their line has gone throughout all the earth,
[00:38:43.000 --> 00:38:45.840]   and their utterances to the end of the world.
[00:38:45.840 --> 00:38:50.640]   In them he has placed a tent for the sun,
[00:38:50.640 --> 00:38:53.400]   which is as a bridegroom coming out of his chamber,
[00:38:53.400 --> 00:38:56.480]   it rejoices as a strong man to run his course.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:38:58.800]   Its rising is from one end of the heavens,
[00:38:58.800 --> 00:39:00.880]   and its circuit to the other end of them,
[00:39:00.880 --> 00:39:03.760]   and there is nothing hidden from its heat.
[00:39:04.680 --> 00:39:08.360]   So here David hones in on the splendor of the sun.
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:11.680]   From David's vantage point,
[00:39:11.680 --> 00:39:15.040]   this sky is the largest and vastest thing
[00:39:15.040 --> 00:39:17.180]   that he can behold in all of creation.
[00:39:17.180 --> 00:39:21.320]   And the little sun that he sees
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:24.320]   is the most glorious and mysterious thing
[00:39:24.320 --> 00:39:27.340]   moving through this expanse.
[00:39:27.340 --> 00:39:28.960]   It's something so bright
[00:39:28.960 --> 00:39:32.720]   that he could not gaze at it directly.
[00:39:32.720 --> 00:39:34.700]   I mean, how many of you guys have tried to look at the sun?
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.320]   At least once in your life.
[00:39:36.320 --> 00:39:37.160]   Have you tried it again?
[00:39:37.160 --> 00:39:38.000]   Probably not.
[00:39:38.000 --> 00:39:38.860]   It's like, oh, right?
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:39.960]   It's brilliant.
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:43.360]   This little sun
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:47.720]   daily lights up the entire world,
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.800]   and I can almost imagine a young shepherd boy, David,
[00:39:50.800 --> 00:39:54.360]   laying on the grass, looking up at the sky,
[00:39:54.360 --> 00:39:57.180]   pondering the heavens and the movement of the sun.
[00:39:57.180 --> 00:40:01.800]   In our culture, at a wedding,
[00:40:01.800 --> 00:40:04.800]   all eyes are always supposed to be on whom?
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:08.400]   The bride, okay?
[00:40:08.400 --> 00:40:10.200]   But in the ancient Near East,
[00:40:10.200 --> 00:40:13.040]   all eyes were on the groom.
[00:40:13.040 --> 00:40:14.080]   Sorry, ladies.
[00:40:14.080 --> 00:40:19.980]   In verse five, David likens the daily rise of the sun
[00:40:19.980 --> 00:40:25.120]   and its splendor like the entrance of a groom
[00:40:25.120 --> 00:40:28.360]   into a wedding banquet, okay?
[00:40:28.360 --> 00:40:31.640]   He's dressed splendidly, super shiny,
[00:40:31.640 --> 00:40:33.360]   super glorious.
[00:40:33.360 --> 00:40:36.860]   And then King David likened the sun
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:41.160]   to a buff, strong, championed runner
[00:40:41.160 --> 00:40:44.540]   just running across his course.
[00:40:44.540 --> 00:40:49.800]   And then the sun sets, and I can almost imagine David
[00:40:49.800 --> 00:40:53.040]   enjoying the many colors, orange, red, yellow,
[00:40:53.040 --> 00:40:56.760]   sometimes purple, many colors of the sunset,
[00:40:56.760 --> 00:40:58.600]   and singing songs to God.
[00:40:59.920 --> 00:41:03.280]   In verse six, he also reflects on the heat.
[00:41:03.280 --> 00:41:09.160]   And he writes, "Man, there's nothing hidden from its heat."
[00:41:09.160 --> 00:41:11.860]   I can also imagine a King David
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.280]   on a very hot Mediterranean day,
[00:41:14.280 --> 00:41:17.040]   feeling drained by the heat of the sun,
[00:41:17.040 --> 00:41:18.840]   just as you and I are.
[00:41:18.840 --> 00:41:23.180]   It is said that Jerusalem is one of the cooler
[00:41:23.180 --> 00:41:25.320]   and drier cities in all of Israel.
[00:41:25.320 --> 00:41:27.980]   It makes me wonder if David set the capital in Jerusalem
[00:41:27.980 --> 00:41:32.720]   partially because his desire not to be hot, right?
[00:41:32.720 --> 00:41:36.280]   That's something that I won't know on this side of eternity.
[00:41:36.280 --> 00:41:38.100]   But the sun is beautiful.
[00:41:38.100 --> 00:41:42.840]   The world our God has created,
[00:41:42.840 --> 00:41:45.640]   all of scripture describes is as beautiful.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.760]   Think of a beautiful scene of nature
[00:41:48.760 --> 00:41:51.740]   or some landscape that has once filled you with awe.
[00:41:51.740 --> 00:41:55.880]   Last year, our family visited Yellowstone National Park
[00:41:55.880 --> 00:41:57.720]   and the Grand Tetons,
[00:41:57.720 --> 00:41:58.920]   and they were glorious.
[00:41:58.920 --> 00:42:03.160]   The year before that, we took the kids to Utah,
[00:42:03.160 --> 00:42:05.480]   we saw the hoodoos in Bryce Canyon,
[00:42:05.480 --> 00:42:08.880]   we walked through Zion National Park,
[00:42:08.880 --> 00:42:12.480]   also glorious, also really hot.
[00:42:12.480 --> 00:42:16.420]   And those are just a few beautiful places in America.
[00:42:16.420 --> 00:42:19.780]   The world that God has created is stunning.
[00:42:19.780 --> 00:42:22.960]   And some of you guys who enjoy traveling
[00:42:22.960 --> 00:42:25.280]   understand what I'm talking about.
[00:42:25.280 --> 00:42:27.960]   I've seen the Grand Canyon, too, once.
[00:42:27.960 --> 00:42:32.560]   Back in 2008, flying to Colorado,
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:35.400]   I've only seen the Grand Canyon from a plane.
[00:42:35.400 --> 00:42:37.640]   It was still grand.
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:41.480]   And I always think of God on airplanes.
[00:42:41.480 --> 00:42:43.340]   I enjoy the window seat on airplanes,
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:46.440]   and I enjoy the world beneath me growing smaller and smaller
[00:42:46.440 --> 00:42:48.700]   as the plane gains altitude.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:52.760]   And I always happen to just ponder
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:56.840]   the largeness of this beautiful world.
[00:42:56.840 --> 00:43:01.080]   There are many places and sites in the world
[00:43:01.080 --> 00:43:04.920]   that you can look at and marvel at and feel super tiny.
[00:43:04.920 --> 00:43:08.120]   But you know, it's important to remember
[00:43:08.120 --> 00:43:10.800]   that our planet is nearly 3/4 water.
[00:43:10.800 --> 00:43:14.960]   If you were to somehow manage in your lifetime,
[00:43:14.960 --> 00:43:17.320]   which is impossible, to step foot
[00:43:17.320 --> 00:43:20.000]   onto every country in the world,
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:22.280]   onto every square footage of land,
[00:43:22.280 --> 00:43:25.100]   it's crazy to think that the land
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:27.600]   on which you have stood and walked
[00:43:27.600 --> 00:43:29.540]   does not even make up a quarter
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:31.280]   of the surface area of the planet.
[00:43:31.280 --> 00:43:34.920]   Most of this planet is water.
[00:43:34.920 --> 00:43:37.040]   And man, that water is beautiful, too, right?
[00:43:37.040 --> 00:43:40.080]   Have you guys ever watched the ocean
[00:43:40.080 --> 00:43:42.780]   just standing there on a cliff, just beautiful,
[00:43:42.780 --> 00:43:44.680]   the sun reflecting off the ocean?
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:49.600]   The water is very beautiful to look at from the surface,
[00:43:49.600 --> 00:43:52.540]   but have you ever gone scuba diving or snorkeling?
[00:43:52.540 --> 00:43:55.520]   Sploosh, different world.
[00:43:55.520 --> 00:44:01.680]   The planet on which you and I are living on is huge.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:04.480]   And there are so many things that you can enjoy
[00:44:04.480 --> 00:44:07.580]   to cause you to be in awe of God's handiwork.
[00:44:07.580 --> 00:44:10.000]   But just for a little perspective,
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.040]   allow me to show you a picture of the sun.
[00:44:13.040 --> 00:44:15.480]   And you can look at it, it's not bright, okay?
[00:44:15.480 --> 00:44:19.380]   And how it compares to our ginormous Earth.
[00:44:19.380 --> 00:44:23.140]   Do you see it?
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:29.720]   Are we feeling smaller yet?
[00:44:29.720 --> 00:44:34.620]   Scientists estimate that 1.3 million Earths
[00:44:34.620 --> 00:44:36.840]   can fit inside this sun.
[00:44:36.840 --> 00:44:40.560]   And though it produces fiery heat
[00:44:41.840 --> 00:44:44.680]   from where you and I sit,
[00:44:44.680 --> 00:44:47.560]   the sun looks so small, doesn't it?
[00:44:47.560 --> 00:44:52.280]   I actually wonder how big David imagined
[00:44:52.280 --> 00:44:54.400]   the sun to actually be.
[00:44:54.400 --> 00:44:58.440]   Can you imagine how much David's mind would have been blown
[00:44:58.440 --> 00:45:01.000]   if he saw this image of the size comparison?
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:06.120]   While many pagan nations around worshiped the sun,
[00:45:06.120 --> 00:45:08.840]   David gave glory to the creator of the sun.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:12.800]   I don't imagine that King David ever got to travel
[00:45:12.800 --> 00:45:14.440]   outside of the Mediterranean.
[00:45:14.440 --> 00:45:18.920]   I don't believe that David ever got to see glaciers,
[00:45:18.920 --> 00:45:21.920]   jungles, or even tropical fish.
[00:45:21.920 --> 00:45:25.800]   But how much would David have marveled
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:27.400]   had he been able to scuba dive?
[00:45:27.400 --> 00:45:32.120]   You and I have likely physically seen more things
[00:45:32.120 --> 00:45:35.480]   and more places than King David ever had.
[00:45:35.480 --> 00:45:37.520]   But do we marvel?
[00:45:37.520 --> 00:45:39.440]   Do we stand in awe?
[00:45:39.440 --> 00:45:41.300]   Do we give glory to God?
[00:45:41.300 --> 00:45:46.840]   Or are you so over-stimulated that you're like, eh?
[00:45:46.840 --> 00:45:52.360]   How could the stuff that we see around us
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:54.540]   ever just happen by chance?
[00:45:54.540 --> 00:45:58.080]   I pray that the Lord fill us with awe.
[00:45:58.080 --> 00:46:01.580]   The heavens and all things under the heavens
[00:46:01.580 --> 00:46:02.760]   are telling of the glory of God,
[00:46:02.760 --> 00:46:05.420]   and the expanse and all things under this expanse
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.240]   are declaring the works of his hands,
[00:46:07.240 --> 00:46:11.700]   and this is the testimony of this first witness.
[00:46:11.700 --> 00:46:14.720]   Psalm 19, one again, the heavens are telling
[00:46:14.720 --> 00:46:17.440]   of the glory of God, and their expanse
[00:46:17.440 --> 00:46:21.120]   is declaring the work of his hands.
[00:46:21.120 --> 00:46:23.840]   Secondly, we're gonna be looking at verses seven to 10,
[00:46:23.840 --> 00:46:27.760]   the testimony of the law, the declared word of God.
[00:46:27.760 --> 00:46:31.320]   In verse seven, we have a shift in subjects
[00:46:31.320 --> 00:46:36.160]   from God's creation to God's law, the Torah,
[00:46:36.160 --> 00:46:40.800]   which is a comprehensive term for God's revealed will.
[00:46:40.800 --> 00:46:43.760]   The word law here is used broadly,
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.280]   and not so much in reference to the Mosaic law,
[00:46:47.280 --> 00:46:50.000]   but just God's revealed word.
[00:46:50.000 --> 00:46:54.800]   All scripture is fiat nustas, it's all God breathed,
[00:46:54.800 --> 00:46:58.200]   and scripture has always been God's primary means
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:00.560]   of revealing his heart and his will to mankind.
[00:47:00.560 --> 00:47:05.960]   Through what has been created, we see God's nature,
[00:47:05.960 --> 00:47:09.800]   but through what has been declared and written,
[00:47:09.800 --> 00:47:11.400]   we see God's heart.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:16.320]   We are first taught that God is a jealous God,
[00:47:16.320 --> 00:47:19.960]   but we are taught that this jealous God,
[00:47:19.960 --> 00:47:24.960]   who has a right to be jealous, is unlimited in patience,
[00:47:24.960 --> 00:47:28.180]   is gracious and compassionate, slow to anger
[00:47:28.180 --> 00:47:31.680]   and abounding in loving kindness.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:36.560]   We are taught in the scriptures of God's desires.
[00:47:36.560 --> 00:47:42.620]   We are taught of his will, and his holiness,
[00:47:42.620 --> 00:47:47.400]   and his affections, and we're taught all of these things
[00:47:47.400 --> 00:47:50.320]   through what has been spoken and subsequently written down.
[00:47:50.320 --> 00:47:55.140]   You see, God desires to be known.
[00:47:55.140 --> 00:48:01.240]   God desires to be known by you and by me,
[00:48:02.920 --> 00:48:06.920]   and he articulates himself very clearly
[00:48:06.920 --> 00:48:08.720]   so that you and I can understand,
[00:48:08.720 --> 00:48:15.480]   and his desire for all eternity is actually to know us
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:17.760]   and have us know him.
[00:48:17.760 --> 00:48:20.760]   John 17, three, now this is eternal life,
[00:48:20.760 --> 00:48:23.720]   that they may know you, the only true God in Jesus Christ,
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.960]   whom you have sent.
[00:48:24.960 --> 00:48:29.960]   Eternal life is getting to be awed and amazed
[00:48:30.200 --> 00:48:34.400]   and wowed by God and knowledge of God
[00:48:34.400 --> 00:48:38.740]   each and every day for all eternity.
[00:48:38.740 --> 00:48:45.360]   So God's word is what the focus is in Psalm 19, seven to 10.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.440]   It reads, "The law of the Lord is perfect,
[00:48:48.440 --> 00:48:50.440]   "restoring the soul.
[00:48:50.440 --> 00:48:54.280]   "The testimony of the Lord is sure, making wise the simple.
[00:48:54.280 --> 00:48:57.760]   "The precepts of the Lord are right, rejoicing the heart.
[00:48:57.760 --> 00:49:01.840]   "The commandment of the Lord is pure, enlightening the eyes.
[00:49:01.840 --> 00:49:05.120]   "The fear of the Lord is clean, enduring forever.
[00:49:05.120 --> 00:49:06.700]   "The judgments of the Lord are true,
[00:49:06.700 --> 00:49:08.320]   "they are righteous altogether."
[00:49:08.320 --> 00:49:10.080]   So starting in verse seven,
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:15.200]   God is referred to as a more personal God.
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:17.440]   He is El in verse one.
[00:49:17.440 --> 00:49:20.680]   The heavens are telling the glory of El,
[00:49:20.680 --> 00:49:24.880]   but in this latter half, the personal name of God, Yahweh,
[00:49:24.880 --> 00:49:26.500]   is used seven times.
[00:49:27.720 --> 00:49:30.200]   Now we don't need to go into each the details
[00:49:30.200 --> 00:49:32.480]   as to what the law, the testimony, the precepts,
[00:49:32.480 --> 00:49:36.040]   commandment, fear, judgments, what they specifically are.
[00:49:36.040 --> 00:49:37.720]   All six of those are different terms
[00:49:37.720 --> 00:49:41.240]   for God's revealed will or God's word.
[00:49:41.240 --> 00:49:43.320]   But in this section,
[00:49:43.320 --> 00:49:47.160]   King David says that the word of God, it restores,
[00:49:47.160 --> 00:49:50.360]   it makes wise, it causes joy,
[00:49:50.360 --> 00:49:54.200]   it enlightens and illuminates, it endures.
[00:49:54.200 --> 00:49:57.200]   And the last statement is righteous altogether.
[00:49:57.200 --> 00:50:00.880]   And you can just understand this simply as
[00:50:00.880 --> 00:50:04.120]   the word of God makes whole.
[00:50:04.120 --> 00:50:06.360]   It brings wholeness.
[00:50:06.360 --> 00:50:09.040]   There's a sense of shalom in this,
[00:50:09.040 --> 00:50:11.720]   restored as to how things should be.
[00:50:11.720 --> 00:50:15.860]   The Holy Bible is comprised of 66 books
[00:50:15.860 --> 00:50:17.360]   written in three original languages
[00:50:17.360 --> 00:50:19.380]   in multiple differing cultures,
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:22.280]   geographical, historical contexts.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:24.600]   It spans over 1,500 years
[00:50:24.600 --> 00:50:27.880]   and it's recorded through more than 40 different men.
[00:50:27.880 --> 00:50:31.180]   None of the men who wrote down the Holy Scripture
[00:50:31.180 --> 00:50:33.040]   were writers by trade.
[00:50:33.040 --> 00:50:34.800]   Moses was a prince and a shepherd,
[00:50:34.800 --> 00:50:37.560]   Joshua was a general, David was a king,
[00:50:37.560 --> 00:50:39.680]   Ezekiel was a priest, there were musicians,
[00:50:39.680 --> 00:50:42.920]   tax collectors, scribes, physicians and fishermen.
[00:50:42.920 --> 00:50:45.680]   66 books, three original languages, 1,500 years,
[00:50:45.680 --> 00:50:50.040]   40 different writers, but one author,
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.040]   the Holy Spirit of God, who again,
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:58.040]   clearly wants to make himself known to all people.
[00:50:58.040 --> 00:51:05.080]   2 Peter 1:21 reads, "But know this first of all,
[00:51:05.080 --> 00:51:06.740]   "that no prophecy of Scripture
[00:51:06.740 --> 00:51:09.540]   "is a matter of one's own interpretation.
[00:51:09.540 --> 00:51:12.500]   "For no prophecy was ever made by an act of human will,
[00:51:12.500 --> 00:51:17.500]   "but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God."
[00:51:17.520 --> 00:51:21.540]   And because the Bible was written by one primary author,
[00:51:21.540 --> 00:51:24.400]   there's a singular main message,
[00:51:24.400 --> 00:51:28.240]   one meta-narrative contained within.
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:29.600]   And this is what it is.
[00:51:29.600 --> 00:51:34.600]   Holy God will reconcile sinful man to himself
[00:51:34.600 --> 00:51:39.900]   and redeem him through his own provision
[00:51:39.900 --> 00:51:42.960]   of a perfect savior and atoning sacrifice.
[00:51:42.960 --> 00:51:44.200]   And I'm gonna repeat that for you.
[00:51:44.360 --> 00:51:49.360]   Holy God will reconcile sinful man to himself
[00:51:49.360 --> 00:51:52.820]   and redeem him through his own provision
[00:51:52.820 --> 00:51:56.140]   of a perfect savior, atoning sacrifice.
[00:51:56.140 --> 00:52:00.400]   Genesis to Revelation, one story.
[00:52:00.400 --> 00:52:04.000]   And in many ways, this statement here
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:06.640]   could be the summary of Psalm 19, verse seven to 10.
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:11.840]   We're a Bible church, so I won't expound too much more
[00:52:11.840 --> 00:52:13.640]   on the importance of the Scriptures.
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:15.920]   Most all of us will confess
[00:52:15.920 --> 00:52:17.600]   that the Scriptures are important.
[00:52:17.600 --> 00:52:21.320]   Most all of us will confess that the Bible is central,
[00:52:21.320 --> 00:52:25.940]   that it's powerful, but I wanna pause and ask a question.
[00:52:25.940 --> 00:52:28.840]   And I'm gonna look at verse 10.
[00:52:28.840 --> 00:52:34.680]   And it reads, "They are more desirable than gold.
[00:52:34.680 --> 00:52:38.280]   "Yes, than much fine gold.
[00:52:38.280 --> 00:52:40.840]   "Sweeter also than honey
[00:52:40.840 --> 00:52:42.600]   "in the drippings of the honeycomb."
[00:52:43.600 --> 00:52:45.200]   Is this your confession?
[00:52:45.200 --> 00:52:52.400]   Or in all honesty, would you rather have the gold
[00:52:52.400 --> 00:52:53.240]   than the honey?
[00:52:53.240 --> 00:53:00.800]   Or the job, the degree, the spouse, the baby?
[00:53:00.800 --> 00:53:09.040]   Are the words of God,
[00:53:10.760 --> 00:53:14.640]   that help you know the creator of the universe,
[00:53:14.640 --> 00:53:16.920]   is that invaluable to you?
[00:53:16.920 --> 00:53:20.840]   Is that more desirable to you
[00:53:20.840 --> 00:53:24.160]   than gold or honey?
[00:53:24.160 --> 00:53:28.520]   Is the knowledge of God the goal of your life?
[00:53:28.520 --> 00:53:31.280]   Or is the knowledge of God a means
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:33.280]   to wealth, comfort, and pleasure?
[00:53:33.280 --> 00:53:39.080]   In the ancient Near East, gold was the most valuable commodity
[00:53:39.080 --> 00:53:41.160]   and honey was the sweetest substance
[00:53:41.160 --> 00:53:42.600]   known to people at the time.
[00:53:42.600 --> 00:53:46.440]   What King David is saying here is that the word of God
[00:53:46.440 --> 00:53:49.520]   is not just more desirable than some gold,
[00:53:49.520 --> 00:53:53.680]   but even more than boatloads of it.
[00:53:53.680 --> 00:53:58.120]   Then all the money in the world,
[00:53:58.120 --> 00:54:00.880]   I'd rather have my knowledge of God.
[00:54:00.880 --> 00:54:06.520]   What King David is saying here is that possessing a honeycomb
[00:54:06.520 --> 00:54:09.000]   is like hitting the jackpot on sweet foods.
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:12.240]   It's having the most delicious thing known to man
[00:54:12.240 --> 00:54:13.800]   at the time just on tap.
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.640]   But here King David is saying the word of God
[00:54:18.640 --> 00:54:21.520]   is exponentially more precious
[00:54:21.520 --> 00:54:23.680]   and exponentially more desirable.
[00:54:23.680 --> 00:54:28.000]   Is this true of you?
[00:54:28.000 --> 00:54:30.480]   Or are you just at a Bible teaching church?
[00:54:30.480 --> 00:54:34.800]   Just a gain-in-prosperity type of person?
[00:54:35.800 --> 00:54:37.520]   Just to gain some benefits.
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:41.120]   In verses one to six,
[00:54:41.120 --> 00:54:43.880]   we reflected on the testimony of the heavens.
[00:54:43.880 --> 00:54:44.760]   In verses seven to 10,
[00:54:44.760 --> 00:54:47.240]   we hear the testimony of the word of God.
[00:54:47.240 --> 00:54:48.160]   But third and finally,
[00:54:48.160 --> 00:54:50.560]   we're gonna look at verses 11 to 14,
[00:54:50.560 --> 00:54:55.720]   the testimony of God's redeemed servant.
[00:54:55.720 --> 00:54:58.440]   The testimony of God's redeemed servant.
[00:54:58.440 --> 00:54:59.440]   Verse 11,
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:06.160]   moreover by them, your words,
[00:55:06.160 --> 00:55:08.560]   your servant is warned.
[00:55:08.560 --> 00:55:10.800]   In keeping them, there is great reward.
[00:55:10.800 --> 00:55:14.000]   Who can discern his errors?
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:16.480]   Acquit me of hidden faults.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:19.920]   Also keep back your servant from presumptuous sins.
[00:55:19.920 --> 00:55:22.200]   Let them not rule over me.
[00:55:22.200 --> 00:55:23.840]   Then I will be blameless
[00:55:23.840 --> 00:55:26.640]   and I shall be acquitted of great transgression.
[00:55:26.640 --> 00:55:28.640]   And let the words of my mouth
[00:55:28.640 --> 00:55:30.840]   and the meditation of my heart
[00:55:30.840 --> 00:55:32.960]   be acceptable in your sight, O Lord,
[00:55:32.960 --> 00:55:35.400]   my rock and my redeemer.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:38.040]   In verses 11 to 14,
[00:55:38.040 --> 00:55:40.960]   we see the testimony of a servant
[00:55:40.960 --> 00:55:43.320]   who's been transformed and who's been redeemed.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.320]   Verse 11 connects the word of God
[00:55:47.320 --> 00:55:50.120]   and how it affects its hearers.
[00:55:50.120 --> 00:55:52.040]   As it says in Romans chapter 10,
[00:55:52.040 --> 00:55:54.840]   faith comes from hearing the word, right?
[00:55:56.080 --> 00:56:00.720]   So this sheep heard the shepherd's voice.
[00:56:00.720 --> 00:56:05.720]   The law of God transformed and redeemed this servant of God.
[00:56:05.720 --> 00:56:08.600]   What you learn from this passage
[00:56:08.600 --> 00:56:12.280]   is that a sinner cannot come to an understanding
[00:56:12.280 --> 00:56:15.720]   of the weight of his sins and the error of his ways
[00:56:15.720 --> 00:56:17.760]   unless they are revealed to him.
[00:56:17.760 --> 00:56:21.640]   If you know that you are absolutely depraved
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.680]   in need of great saving,
[00:56:23.680 --> 00:56:25.320]   in need of a great savior,
[00:56:25.320 --> 00:56:26.600]   that's God's grace.
[00:56:26.600 --> 00:56:31.040]   If you are absolutely desperate,
[00:56:31.040 --> 00:56:35.640]   your life, your heart is filthy and you know that,
[00:56:35.640 --> 00:56:37.480]   that was not revealed to you
[00:56:37.480 --> 00:56:42.240]   by just some frivolous thing.
[00:56:42.240 --> 00:56:45.680]   That was told you by the grace of God.
[00:56:45.680 --> 00:56:51.360]   The law of God first revealed to this servant his errors.
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.560]   The God of the age has blinded the minds of the unbelieving,
[00:56:55.560 --> 00:56:59.720]   but God in his grace and through his word
[00:56:59.720 --> 00:57:04.720]   reveals this person of his sin and he convicts.
[00:57:04.720 --> 00:57:07.520]   And the sins that were deeply rooted in the heart,
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:09.080]   the sins that have been hidden
[00:57:09.080 --> 00:57:13.420]   have been brought to the surface and expunged.
[00:57:13.420 --> 00:57:17.640]   The heart bent on presumptuous sins,
[00:57:17.640 --> 00:57:20.960]   in other words, a willful desire for sin,
[00:57:22.320 --> 00:57:24.680]   is restrained, and the tense of that word
[00:57:24.680 --> 00:57:29.160]   is being more and more restrained as time goes on.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:34.640]   And this servant is now a man who's rendered blameless.
[00:57:34.640 --> 00:57:38.720]   He has been acquitted of these great transgressions.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:43.800]   This section does not speak on any merit of the servant.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:46.840]   He didn't earn any of this.
[00:57:46.840 --> 00:57:48.240]   He was redeemed.
[00:57:50.520 --> 00:57:55.520]   No unregenerate person can call Christ his redeemer
[00:57:55.520 --> 00:57:58.800]   'cause he's still in bondage to sin.
[00:57:58.800 --> 00:58:02.880]   But this servant, King David,
[00:58:02.880 --> 00:58:06.160]   has met the Lord, his redeemer,
[00:58:06.160 --> 00:58:09.380]   and King David closes this psalm in worship.
[00:58:09.380 --> 00:58:13.600]   Psalm 1914, which closes the psalm.
[00:58:13.600 --> 00:58:15.120]   It's one of the most memorized verses
[00:58:15.120 --> 00:58:16.080]   of all the psalms, right?
[00:58:16.080 --> 00:58:17.920]   You guys are almost hearing the song in your head.
[00:58:17.920 --> 00:58:19.860]   ♪ May the words of my mouth ♪
[00:58:19.860 --> 00:58:20.960]   You hear it, right?
[00:58:20.960 --> 00:58:23.040]   Well, now you do, okay?
[00:58:23.040 --> 00:58:25.080]   ♪ Let the words of my mouth ♪
[00:58:25.080 --> 00:58:27.000]   And that word let is let.
[00:58:27.000 --> 00:58:28.840]   It's not may.
[00:58:28.840 --> 00:58:31.280]   That translation bugs me, okay?
[00:58:31.280 --> 00:58:34.240]   But let the words of my mouth
[00:58:34.240 --> 00:58:36.960]   and the meditation of my heart
[00:58:36.960 --> 00:58:39.080]   be acceptable in your sight, O Lord,
[00:58:39.080 --> 00:58:41.120]   my rock and my redeemer.
[00:58:41.120 --> 00:58:43.040]   So what happens to a man
[00:58:43.040 --> 00:58:45.280]   as he marvels at God's handiwork?
[00:58:45.280 --> 00:58:47.600]   What happens to a man as he ponders
[00:58:47.600 --> 00:58:49.200]   deeply the word of God?
[00:58:49.200 --> 00:58:52.660]   What happens to a man when God wipes away his sin,
[00:58:52.660 --> 00:58:54.540]   acquits him of all transgression,
[00:58:54.540 --> 00:58:56.820]   redeems his life from the pit?
[00:58:56.820 --> 00:58:59.540]   This man cannot but worship in awe
[00:58:59.540 --> 00:59:01.740]   and in fear and with much trembling.
[00:59:01.740 --> 00:59:03.300]   The words of his mouth
[00:59:03.300 --> 00:59:05.380]   and the meditations of his heart
[00:59:05.380 --> 00:59:09.140]   is acceptable in the sight of Yahweh God.
[00:59:09.140 --> 00:59:13.060]   It has been accepted at the cross of Christ.
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:16.980]   It was confirmed at the resurrection of Christ.
[00:59:16.980 --> 00:59:18.800]   And for the person whose eyes,
[00:59:18.800 --> 00:59:20.160]   the scales have fallen off,
[00:59:20.160 --> 00:59:23.040]   the heart is transformed, accept it.
[00:59:23.040 --> 00:59:27.160]   The more I meditate on this psalm,
[00:59:27.160 --> 00:59:30.900]   I'm seeing that verse 14 is not a request or a prayer.
[00:59:30.900 --> 00:59:32.480]   That's why I don't like the may
[00:59:32.480 --> 00:59:34.440]   and only the NIV translates it may.
[00:59:34.440 --> 00:59:37.180]   So most others, they all literally translate it let.
[00:59:37.180 --> 00:59:40.560]   This is not an inquiry.
[00:59:40.560 --> 00:59:44.120]   It's a declaration.
[00:59:45.860 --> 00:59:48.140]   The declaration of the heavens,
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:50.220]   the declaration of the law,
[00:59:50.220 --> 00:59:52.740]   the declaration of a transformed saint.
[00:59:52.740 --> 00:59:57.140]   This is a declaration of a spiritual man,
[00:59:57.140 --> 00:59:58.540]   a redeemed man.
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:01.220]   When I was first preparing for this sermon,
[01:00:01.220 --> 01:00:03.580]   I titled the sermon Acceptable in His Sight
[01:00:03.580 --> 01:00:06.100]   'cause that's what the verse says, right?
[01:00:06.100 --> 01:00:08.240]   But the more I chewed on this psalm,
[01:00:08.240 --> 01:00:13.660]   I changed the title to Accept Dead in His Sight.
[01:00:14.660 --> 01:00:17.800]   Is this a declaration of your life?
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:21.400]   Is this your testimony?
[01:00:21.400 --> 01:00:25.560]   So how do you know?
[01:00:25.560 --> 01:00:28.160]   I mean, what if you asked,
[01:00:28.160 --> 01:00:31.760]   let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
[01:00:31.760 --> 01:00:33.240]   be acceptable in your sight,
[01:00:33.240 --> 01:00:34.440]   and God says, no.
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:38.800]   Yikes.
[01:00:38.800 --> 01:00:42.960]   So how do you know?
[01:00:43.900 --> 01:00:45.260]   The redeemed servant,
[01:00:45.260 --> 01:00:48.820]   when he hears the testimony of the heavens
[01:00:48.820 --> 01:00:52.940]   of all creation marvels and worships God.
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:57.540]   The unredeemed man, the fool,
[01:00:57.540 --> 01:01:00.380]   says in his heart, there is no God,
[01:01:00.380 --> 01:01:02.100]   lives however he wants to,
[01:01:02.100 --> 01:01:06.500]   and worships the created thing
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:07.820]   rather than the creator.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:13.560]   The redeemed servant, when he hears the testimony
[01:01:13.560 --> 01:01:16.120]   of the word of God, when it's proclaimed,
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:19.080]   the redeemed servant from the core of his heart says,
[01:01:19.080 --> 01:01:23.080]   amen, even if it's full of hypocrisy of the heart,
[01:01:23.080 --> 01:01:25.960]   his soul cries out, let it be, amen.
[01:01:25.960 --> 01:01:32.600]   And he humbles himself before the word of God,
[01:01:32.600 --> 01:01:34.840]   and he desires to obey.
[01:01:34.840 --> 01:01:38.800]   And the redeemed servant wants to obey,
[01:01:38.800 --> 01:01:42.260]   and the redeemed servant wants to know the word of God
[01:01:42.260 --> 01:01:46.180]   more than he wants money, more than he wants pleasure.
[01:01:46.180 --> 01:01:49.900]   He wants God.
[01:01:49.900 --> 01:01:54.700]   His desire is not to use God,
[01:01:54.700 --> 01:01:57.180]   it's to know God.
[01:01:57.180 --> 01:02:01.460]   And he hungers because God makes himself known
[01:02:01.460 --> 01:02:03.540]   clearly through the word.
[01:02:03.540 --> 01:02:06.900]   The unredeemed man says things like,
[01:02:06.900 --> 01:02:09.580]   I know that's what the Bible says, but.
[01:02:09.580 --> 01:02:16.180]   The unredeemed man, when confronted
[01:02:16.180 --> 01:02:19.980]   with an uncomfortable biblical truth,
[01:02:19.980 --> 01:02:22.860]   will change and distort the truth.
[01:02:22.860 --> 01:02:28.940]   Will surround himself with a great number of teachers
[01:02:28.940 --> 01:02:32.260]   who will say what he wants to hear,
[01:02:32.260 --> 01:02:34.580]   and say amen to lies.
[01:02:36.260 --> 01:02:39.860]   He will gather around himself voices
[01:02:39.860 --> 01:02:42.660]   that will repeatedly tell him,
[01:02:42.660 --> 01:02:47.660]   you can continue in your sin because it's all about grace.
[01:02:47.660 --> 01:02:56.260]   And the unredeemed man will focus on studying
[01:02:56.260 --> 01:02:58.620]   only the parts of the scriptures
[01:02:58.620 --> 01:03:03.140]   that don't make him feel guilty in his disobedience.
[01:03:03.140 --> 01:03:08.140]   The redeemed servant, when he is shown his sin,
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:15.820]   is convicted, and he repents.
[01:03:15.820 --> 01:03:17.300]   Woe is me.
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:21.060]   Lord, to whom shall we go?
[01:03:21.060 --> 01:03:24.220]   You have the words of eternal life.
[01:03:24.220 --> 01:03:29.220]   I believe, help my unbelief, have mercy on me, a sinner.
[01:03:32.020 --> 01:03:35.600]   The unredeemed man hardens his heart,
[01:03:35.600 --> 01:03:39.580]   shepherds grace, and then he continues in his sin.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:41.300]   Ah, I don't hear nothing.
[01:03:41.300 --> 01:03:42.420]   Yeah, I could do whatever I want
[01:03:42.420 --> 01:03:44.520]   'cause I went down the altar, I made a confession.
[01:03:44.520 --> 01:03:47.140]   Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.
[01:03:47.140 --> 01:03:48.380]   The Bible you don't read.
[01:03:48.380 --> 01:03:51.680]   That's the unredeemed man.
[01:03:51.680 --> 01:03:55.480]   Imagine that you are at the great white throne judgment
[01:03:55.480 --> 01:03:57.420]   described for us in Revelation 20.
[01:03:57.420 --> 01:04:01.200]   The books are open, and you declare,
[01:04:01.200 --> 01:04:04.840]   let the words of my mouth and the meditation of my heart
[01:04:04.840 --> 01:04:09.180]   be acceptable in your sight, O Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[01:04:09.180 --> 01:04:12.220]   and the judge on the throne declares,
[01:04:12.220 --> 01:04:16.280]   your words are filthy because your mouth is filthy,
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:19.520]   because your meditations of your heart are filthy.
[01:04:19.520 --> 01:04:21.600]   They are not acceptable in my sight.
[01:04:21.600 --> 01:04:24.220]   You don't have the blood of Christ covering you.
[01:04:24.220 --> 01:04:27.940]   I never knew you, depart from me, you worker of lawlessness.
[01:04:29.820 --> 01:04:31.100]   Scary.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:34.800]   So is this your testimony?
[01:04:34.800 --> 01:04:39.860]   I shared earlier that God never leaves his will
[01:04:39.860 --> 01:04:43.380]   to guesswork, he never calls his people
[01:04:43.380 --> 01:04:47.460]   to guess what he's thinking or what he requires.
[01:04:47.460 --> 01:04:53.860]   God's will for you, God's will for me, is clear, amen?
[01:04:56.300 --> 01:05:01.300]   He makes himself crystal clear, it's explicit.
[01:05:01.300 --> 01:05:08.180]   Every Christian who has the Holy Spirit of God in him
[01:05:08.180 --> 01:05:13.180]   is supernaturally now hardwired to exalt and to glory in God,
[01:05:13.180 --> 01:05:18.040]   to delight in his word, to turn away from sin, and to obey.
[01:05:18.040 --> 01:05:23.040]   Every Christian, in a sense, is now a God's mind reader.
[01:05:25.540 --> 01:05:28.980]   You have the mind of Christ that helps you
[01:05:28.980 --> 01:05:32.300]   to discern what he wants and empowers you
[01:05:32.300 --> 01:05:34.580]   to carry out God's desires.
[01:05:34.580 --> 01:05:37.660]   You, as a Christian, who has a Holy Spirit of God
[01:05:37.660 --> 01:05:41.300]   indwelling within him, have the mind of Christ.
[01:05:41.300 --> 01:05:45.780]   First Corinthians chapter two.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:49.020]   A natural man does not accept the things
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:52.900]   of the Spirit of God, for they are utter foolishness to him.
[01:05:52.900 --> 01:05:54.260]   He cannot understand them
[01:05:54.260 --> 01:05:56.160]   because they are spiritually appraised.
[01:05:56.160 --> 01:06:00.900]   But he who is spiritual appraises correctly all things,
[01:06:00.900 --> 01:06:03.080]   yet he himself is appraised by no one,
[01:06:03.080 --> 01:06:05.520]   for who has known the mind of the Lord
[01:06:05.520 --> 01:06:07.460]   that he will instruct him?
[01:06:07.460 --> 01:06:12.460]   We have the mind of Christ.
[01:06:12.460 --> 01:06:18.220]   When Becky explicitly told me
[01:06:18.220 --> 01:06:20.180]   before our third Valentine's Day
[01:06:20.180 --> 01:06:23.340]   that she likes peonies, that she likes Ferrero Rocher,
[01:06:23.340 --> 01:06:25.540]   that she likes to read nice words on a card,
[01:06:25.540 --> 01:06:28.320]   I listened.
[01:06:28.320 --> 01:06:31.760]   I wanted to.
[01:06:31.760 --> 01:06:38.100]   Think with me, what would've happened if I ignored it?
[01:06:38.100 --> 01:06:43.780]   What would've happened if I laughed off these requests?
[01:06:43.780 --> 01:06:46.300]   I could've just said no, right?
[01:06:46.300 --> 01:06:53.180]   Those are not things that would disqualify me
[01:06:53.180 --> 01:06:54.840]   from her hand in marriage.
[01:06:54.840 --> 01:06:59.260]   What would disqualify me from her hand in marriage
[01:06:59.260 --> 01:07:03.280]   and her heart is this revelation of my heart
[01:07:03.280 --> 01:07:07.780]   that has learned what she wants, but I still don't care.
[01:07:07.780 --> 01:07:11.820]   That knows what will make her happy,
[01:07:11.820 --> 01:07:16.820]   but I would rather prioritize my comfort than her happiness.
[01:07:16.820 --> 01:07:20.000]   So the diso, okay, it's not obedience,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.300]   'cause she didn't demand, okay?
[01:07:21.300 --> 01:07:26.300]   The reluctance to apply what she desires
[01:07:26.300 --> 01:07:33.380]   is not any kind of prerequisite,
[01:07:33.380 --> 01:07:36.860]   it's symptomatic of what's in my heart.
[01:07:36.860 --> 01:07:41.640]   Imagine if the following year I bought her a treadmill.
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.740]   I don't think we'd still be married,
[01:07:44.740 --> 01:07:45.940]   and I don't think I would've used this
[01:07:45.940 --> 01:07:47.180]   in a sermon illustration.
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.260]   My Valentine's Day performances would not make
[01:07:53.260 --> 01:07:55.100]   or break the quality of our relationships.
[01:07:55.100 --> 01:07:57.300]   Those are not things that are required of me.
[01:07:57.300 --> 01:08:00.100]   Those are things that I delight in.
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:04.880]   Why would I not do those things?
[01:08:04.880 --> 01:08:10.020]   If this giant God of the universe
[01:08:10.020 --> 01:08:13.900]   has reconciled himself to you,
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:17.300]   has promised you not just a great inheritance,
[01:08:17.300 --> 01:08:20.380]   but to be a co-heir with Christ,
[01:08:20.380 --> 01:08:23.460]   seated on the place of a throne,
[01:08:23.460 --> 01:08:26.920]   where you're given the authority to judge angels,
[01:08:26.920 --> 01:08:32.020]   how are you not in awe?
[01:08:32.020 --> 01:08:35.140]   How are you not grateful?
[01:08:35.140 --> 01:08:40.140]   How are you not so just speechless and filled with love
[01:08:40.140 --> 01:08:47.620]   that you cannot but do what he wants?
[01:08:48.340 --> 01:08:53.020]   I wanna close with Romans chapter one, verse 18 to 25,
[01:08:53.020 --> 01:08:55.580]   and I want you to pay attention as I read this.
[01:08:55.580 --> 01:09:03.060]   It really speaks on Psalm 19 well.
[01:09:03.060 --> 01:09:06.840]   The wrath of God is revealed from heaven
[01:09:06.840 --> 01:09:11.060]   against all ungodliness and unrighteousness of men
[01:09:11.060 --> 01:09:13.800]   who suppress the truth in unrighteousness,
[01:09:13.800 --> 01:09:17.060]   because that which is known about God
[01:09:17.060 --> 01:09:21.500]   is evident within them, for God made it evident to them.
[01:09:21.500 --> 01:09:24.220]   For since the creation of the world,
[01:09:24.220 --> 01:09:28.700]   his invisible attributes, his eternal power,
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:33.020]   divine nature, have been clearly seen,
[01:09:33.020 --> 01:09:37.020]   being understood through what has been made,
[01:09:37.020 --> 01:09:39.860]   so that they are without excuse.
[01:09:39.860 --> 01:09:42.500]   For even though they knew God,
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:46.500]   they did not honor him as God or give thanks,
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.340]   but they became futile in their speculations,
[01:09:49.340 --> 01:09:52.140]   their foolish hearts were darkened,
[01:09:52.140 --> 01:09:53.900]   professing to be wise.
[01:09:53.900 --> 01:09:58.900]   I have PhDs, I have experience, professing to have knowledge.
[01:09:58.900 --> 01:10:05.300]   They became fools and exchanged the glory
[01:10:05.300 --> 01:10:08.260]   of the incorruptible God for an image
[01:10:08.260 --> 01:10:10.100]   in the form of corruptible man and of birds
[01:10:10.100 --> 01:10:12.740]   and of four-footed animals and crawling creatures.
[01:10:12.740 --> 01:10:15.700]   Therefore, God gave them over in the lust of their hearts
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.320]   to impurity so that their bodies
[01:10:18.320 --> 01:10:20.180]   would be dishonored among them,
[01:10:20.180 --> 01:10:23.820]   for they exchanged the truth of God for a lie
[01:10:23.820 --> 01:10:27.820]   and worshiped and served the creature
[01:10:27.820 --> 01:10:32.460]   rather than the creator who is blessed forever, amen.
[01:10:32.460 --> 01:10:37.700]   You and I have been created by God and for God
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.400]   to love God and to serve God, that's our purpose, amen?
[01:10:40.400 --> 01:10:44.180]   We exist for him, he doesn't exist for us.
[01:10:44.180 --> 01:10:46.660]   You and I have been created by God and for God
[01:10:46.660 --> 01:10:48.300]   to love God and to serve God.
[01:10:48.300 --> 01:10:51.460]   He is our rock, he is our redeemer,
[01:10:51.460 --> 01:10:53.700]   he's the reason why we live.
[01:10:53.700 --> 01:10:57.540]   So we desire to be a blessing to him
[01:10:57.540 --> 01:10:59.340]   and through him to all people
[01:10:59.340 --> 01:11:01.780]   so they would know how good it is,
[01:11:01.780 --> 01:11:04.760]   how good our God is.
[01:11:04.760 --> 01:11:10.460]   Is that the heartbeat of your life,
[01:11:10.460 --> 01:11:12.660]   to be a blessing to God?
[01:11:13.660 --> 01:11:18.660]   May we be faithful in fulfilling our God-given purposes,
[01:11:18.660 --> 01:11:24.460]   amen, 'cause we will join in witness and in chorus
[01:11:24.460 --> 01:11:31.620]   for all eternity declaring the glories of God, amen?
[01:11:31.620 --> 01:11:35.340]   Let's pray together.
[01:11:35.340 --> 01:11:38.340]   Father, we pray that you would help us
[01:11:38.340 --> 01:11:42.180]   to disentangle our hearts and our minds' affections
[01:11:42.180 --> 01:11:45.180]   and place them solely on the person of Jesus Christ.
[01:11:45.180 --> 01:11:46.360]   Guide us in this endeavor.
[01:11:46.360 --> 01:11:49.020]   The things of the world have great appeal,
[01:11:49.020 --> 01:11:52.460]   but help us to get disgusted more and more.
[01:11:52.460 --> 01:11:54.740]   The Lord, also help us to grow in great affection
[01:11:54.740 --> 01:11:58.180]   and compassion for the lost because that's your heart.
[01:11:58.180 --> 01:12:01.020]   So teach us how to live like you.
[01:12:01.020 --> 01:12:02.180]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:12:02.180 --> 01:12:06.620]   - Let us stand together, we'll close in song.
