[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.200]   In Hebrews chapter 2 verses 1 through 4, our main focus is going to be the second part,
[00:00:08.200 --> 00:00:10.000]   verse 3 to 4.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.440]   For this reason we must pay much closer attention to what we have heard so that we do not drift
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:15.440]   away from it.
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:20.640]   For if the word spoken through angels proved unalterable, and every transgression and disobedience
[00:00:20.640 --> 00:00:26.200]   received a just penalty, how will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:30.840]   For it was at first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who heard,
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.840]   God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders, and by various miracles, and
[00:00:34.840 --> 00:00:37.880]   by gifts of the Holy Spirit, according to His own will.
[00:00:37.880 --> 00:00:43.520]   Let me just jump right into the message this morning.
[00:00:43.520 --> 00:00:51.440]   You know in every person's life we can divide our lives into four different compartments.
[00:00:51.440 --> 00:00:56.000]   If you've done marriage counseling with me at any point, I think not 100% but a lot of
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.320]   you, I kind of went through this about time management, and there's four different compartments
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.040]   of our lives.
[00:01:03.040 --> 00:01:06.360]   First is the important and urgent things.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:12.240]   These are things like finals, your jobs, deadlines, bills.
[00:01:12.240 --> 00:01:16.280]   These are things that if you don't take care of, there's immediate consequences.
[00:01:16.280 --> 00:01:21.760]   So our tendency is if you're not good at taking care of the important and urgent things, it's
[00:01:21.760 --> 00:01:22.760]   going to show immediately.
[00:01:22.760 --> 00:01:25.240]   You're going to lose your job, you're going to fail your class, you're not going to be
[00:01:25.240 --> 00:01:28.240]   able to pay your bills, and etc., etc.
[00:01:28.240 --> 00:01:33.320]   So our tendency is because it's urgent and because it's important, this is where we give
[00:01:33.320 --> 00:01:34.320]   all of our attention.
[00:01:34.320 --> 00:01:38.840]   So if you're poor at doing this part, if you're not responsible in the urgent and important
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:43.680]   things, I'm pretty sure that you feel like your life is out of chaos, like it's completely
[00:01:43.680 --> 00:01:44.680]   out of order.
[00:01:44.680 --> 00:01:48.440]   So you naturally tend to pay a lot of attention to this area.
[00:01:48.440 --> 00:01:53.520]   The second part of our life is urgent but not important.
[00:01:53.520 --> 00:01:55.360]   We're urgent because we made it important.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:02:00.000]   An example of that would be maybe football.
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:04.100]   It's urgent because you volunteered, you're part of the team.
[00:02:04.100 --> 00:02:06.920]   Maybe you were playing an important part.
[00:02:06.920 --> 00:02:10.120]   But it's not important in the scheme of life.
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.200]   Because you didn't win this football tournament, you're going to regret it when you're 60 years
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:14.200]   old.
[00:02:14.200 --> 00:02:15.200]   It's like, we should have won.
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:17.400]   We should have put more effort into this.
[00:02:17.400 --> 00:02:21.860]   So it's urgent because we made it important, because we volunteered.
[00:02:21.860 --> 00:02:27.080]   So it could be football, vacation plans, anything that you decided to do and you volunteered
[00:02:27.080 --> 00:02:30.140]   to do, so as a result, you need to be responsible.
[00:02:30.140 --> 00:02:32.520]   These are urgent but not important.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:36.600]   And then the third category are not important and not urgent.
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:39.200]   These are what we call time wasters.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:40.960]   Not necessarily sinful.
[00:02:40.960 --> 00:02:44.040]   These are movies you watch or video games.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:46.860]   Whatever it is, you're not responsible, you just enjoy doing it.
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:50.800]   So after a long day of work, you just kind of come home and unwind.
[00:02:50.800 --> 00:02:54.740]   So maybe you watch a lot of sports, maybe you watch a lot of YouTube videos, whatever
[00:02:54.740 --> 00:02:58.040]   it may be, it's not important, it's not urgent.
[00:02:58.040 --> 00:03:02.600]   Again, like I said, if you do too much of this, it will encroach upon other areas of
[00:03:02.600 --> 00:03:04.120]   your life.
[00:03:04.120 --> 00:03:08.560]   So our natural tendency in these three categories, we pay attention to the first, but if you
[00:03:08.560 --> 00:03:14.760]   pay too much attention to the second and third, you begin to have issues in your life.
[00:03:14.760 --> 00:03:20.980]   But the area that we would consider the most important fall into the fourth category.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.120]   Fourth category is important but not urgent.
[00:03:25.120 --> 00:03:30.280]   What would fall into this category is typically God, church, family, health.
[00:03:30.280 --> 00:03:35.680]   These are things that if you ask an average person, in particular a Christian, name the
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.180]   things that are the most important in your life.
[00:03:39.180 --> 00:03:42.760]   If you're a Christian, your first answer automatically is God.
[00:03:42.760 --> 00:03:45.700]   My relationship with God is the most important thing in my life.
[00:03:45.700 --> 00:03:50.480]   And then you would say maybe church or family, and then maybe health, maybe my friends, whatever
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:51.760]   order you may be.
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.040]   But almost everybody, every Christian will say God.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.160]   But this area, it's important.
[00:03:58.160 --> 00:04:02.520]   In fact, it's not just important, it's the most important thing.
[00:04:02.520 --> 00:04:06.360]   Yet it is not urgent, because there is no deadline.
[00:04:06.360 --> 00:04:08.840]   There's nothing that requires you to do it by a certain time.
[00:04:08.840 --> 00:04:14.360]   So what ends up happening is, if we fill our calendar with all these other things, important
[00:04:14.360 --> 00:04:20.120]   but not urgent, or not urgent and not important, that you start to run out of time to do what
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:23.920]   is important but not urgent.
[00:04:23.920 --> 00:04:28.280]   This is the area of our life, by the time you retire and look back in your 20s and 30s
[00:04:28.280 --> 00:04:31.840]   and 40s, this is the area of your life when you look back and say, "I should have spent
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:33.840]   more time with my kids.
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.580]   I should have taken care of my health better.
[00:04:35.580 --> 00:04:37.280]   I should have invested better.
[00:04:37.280 --> 00:04:40.920]   I should have done this in my faith."
[00:04:40.920 --> 00:04:46.240]   These are the things where you wish you had your 20s and 30s and 40s back to do over,
[00:04:46.240 --> 00:04:50.840]   because you neglected it.
[00:04:50.840 --> 00:04:56.840]   Strange thing is, the things that we say are the most important in our life is the area
[00:04:56.840 --> 00:05:01.480]   that we tend to most neglect.
[00:05:01.480 --> 00:05:08.200]   Jim Elliot, if you remember, Jim Elliot was a man who died in the mission field trying
[00:05:08.200 --> 00:05:15.120]   to share the gospel with a remote Indian tribe in Ecuador.
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:19.480]   Many of you know who he is, and his famous quote in his journal, he says, "He is no fool
[00:05:19.480 --> 00:05:24.200]   who gives up what he cannot keep to gain what he cannot lose."
[00:05:24.200 --> 00:05:30.360]   I know many of you have probably heard that phrase before, that quote before, but it fits
[00:05:30.360 --> 00:05:35.120]   in right in with what the author of Hebrews has been saying.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:39.080]   He is no fool who gives up what he cannot keep.
[00:05:39.080 --> 00:05:44.520]   These temporary things, these urgent but not important things, not important, not urgent
[00:05:44.520 --> 00:05:49.360]   things, who gives up these things in order for him to pursue what is important, but what
[00:05:49.360 --> 00:05:53.680]   may not seem urgent at the time.
[00:05:53.680 --> 00:05:55.200]   In fact, he has another quote.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:01.560]   This is not as famous, but in that same journal, just a few months before he actually goes
[00:06:01.560 --> 00:06:08.160]   to Ecuador and dies, he writes in his journal, "I seek not a long life, but a full one like
[00:06:08.160 --> 00:06:09.920]   you, Lord."
[00:06:09.920 --> 00:06:15.520]   And he wrote this in one of his devotionals, and again, it's not a well-quoted one, but
[00:06:15.520 --> 00:06:18.760]   it captures his heart and the way he lived.
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:24.080]   He was a man who fully understood what was most important in his life, and he was willing
[00:06:24.080 --> 00:06:30.000]   to give his life to share this gospel, whether he lives a long life or a short life.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:34.500]   That's exactly what Apostle Paul says in 1 Corinthians 9, 19.
[00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.600]   He looks at his life, he says, "For though I am free from all men, I have made myself
[00:06:38.600 --> 00:06:42.640]   a slave to all so that I may win more."
[00:06:42.640 --> 00:06:47.440]   Apostle Paul says that because of what Christ has done, he's the one who argues in Colossians,
[00:06:47.440 --> 00:06:48.920]   in Galatians.
[00:06:48.920 --> 00:06:53.680]   He's the one who argues, not to be caught up in saying, "I'm going to do this or not
[00:06:53.680 --> 00:06:56.280]   do this," because in and of itself has no power.
[00:06:56.280 --> 00:06:57.880]   He is free.
[00:06:57.880 --> 00:07:02.880]   Our salvation is not based upon our works, but the grace of God.
[00:07:02.880 --> 00:07:04.340]   He's the one who teaches us that.
[00:07:04.340 --> 00:07:06.740]   He's the one who's fighting legalism.
[00:07:06.740 --> 00:07:13.800]   And yet he says, "Though I am free, I make myself a slave that I may, by all means, save
[00:07:13.800 --> 00:07:15.160]   some."
[00:07:15.160 --> 00:07:20.200]   He knew what was important in his life, and he knows it wasn't much of a choice for him
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.040]   to give up what he could not keep in order for him to share the gospel and bring people
[00:07:25.040 --> 00:07:26.040]   to Christ.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.760]   Again, in 1 Corinthians 9, 22, "To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak.
[00:07:30.760 --> 00:07:37.200]   I have become all things to all men so that I may, by all means, save some."
[00:07:37.200 --> 00:07:42.280]   If we're not careful, we can get into this constant argument of what is and isn't allowed
[00:07:42.280 --> 00:07:43.880]   in the Bible.
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:46.360]   What is gray area and what is not gray area?
[00:07:46.360 --> 00:07:51.280]   And in the context of arguing that, our motivation at times is, "Well, God set me free, so don't
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:53.280]   put any restrictions on me."
[00:07:53.280 --> 00:08:00.960]   See, that argument in and of itself is based upon a wrong desire.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:06.880]   He's saying in Hebrews, "Considering what we profess, considering the songs that we
[00:08:06.880 --> 00:08:12.120]   sing, considering the gospel that we know that has come to us, how will we escape if
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:16.840]   our response to that is simply, 'I believe,' and that's it?"
[00:08:16.840 --> 00:08:22.680]   See, these areas, other areas of our life that we tend to drift and neglect, that's
[00:08:22.680 --> 00:08:25.040]   what he's trying to prevent us from.
[00:08:25.040 --> 00:08:28.440]   That we don't live the rest of our lives and look back and say, "You know what?
[00:08:28.440 --> 00:08:30.920]   I wish I watched more movies when I was younger.
[00:08:30.920 --> 00:08:33.080]   I really regret that.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:39.120]   You know, I wish that I spent more time doing this or that."
[00:08:39.120 --> 00:08:43.200]   But to live consistently with the things that we profess, that we do not simply drift, we
[00:08:43.200 --> 00:08:45.200]   do not simply neglect.
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:47.480]   He says, "How will we escape this if we do this?"
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.520]   Well, it's understandable if non-Christians do that.
[00:08:50.520 --> 00:08:54.480]   In 1 Corinthians 1:18, it says, "For the word of the cross is foolishness to those who are
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:59.320]   perishing, but to us who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:03.560]   So to those who are perishing, who have not seen the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[00:09:03.560 --> 00:09:05.020]   so they don't believe.
[00:09:05.020 --> 00:09:08.080]   So the message of the cross is foolishness.
[00:09:08.080 --> 00:09:09.320]   It's dumb.
[00:09:09.320 --> 00:09:12.340]   How can you people possibly believe this?
[00:09:12.340 --> 00:09:14.560]   That there's a heaven and hell?
[00:09:14.560 --> 00:09:20.040]   How can you possibly believe that a human being died and came back to life?
[00:09:20.040 --> 00:09:25.800]   So if you're a non-believer and you believe that the cross is foolishness, then it's understandable
[00:09:25.800 --> 00:09:28.080]   that they neglect it.
[00:09:28.080 --> 00:09:32.840]   It's understandable that they don't pay attention, that they just move away from it.
[00:09:32.840 --> 00:09:35.600]   So once a year, they might come to church.
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:39.900]   They might come to events if a good Christian friend invites them to come.
[00:09:39.900 --> 00:09:41.780]   But that's about it.
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:48.680]   But he says, "But to those who are being saved, it is the power of God."
[00:09:48.680 --> 00:09:56.440]   So it doesn't make sense for someone professing the gospel to be true and to simply neglect
[00:09:56.440 --> 00:10:02.920]   it and respond no different than an unbeliever.
[00:10:02.920 --> 00:10:05.400]   He responds, "Well, I believe that."
[00:10:05.400 --> 00:10:09.880]   And the only difference is you profess to believe it versus somebody who profess to
[00:10:09.880 --> 00:10:10.880]   reject it.
[00:10:10.880 --> 00:10:15.040]   See, people who neglect and drift away from their faith, they don't drift away from their
[00:10:15.040 --> 00:10:17.980]   faith shaking their fist at God.
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.840]   They don't drift away by saying, "You know what?
[00:10:19.840 --> 00:10:21.440]   I don't believe you.
[00:10:21.440 --> 00:10:23.360]   How can you have done this to me?"
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:28.200]   They don't drift away from God clinging on to heresy.
[00:10:28.200 --> 00:10:31.400]   It's simply out of neglect.
[00:10:31.400 --> 00:10:37.120]   They'll say it's important, but it's just not important enough.
[00:10:37.120 --> 00:10:43.640]   They'll say it's most important, but by the way that we live, it's just not that important.
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:47.080]   There are a lot of other things that are urgent, but this is just not urgent.
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:50.640]   It just goes into one of those categories, important but not urgent.
[00:10:50.640 --> 00:10:58.400]   See, 1 Thessalonians 5.3, it describes how people are condemned.
[00:10:58.400 --> 00:11:02.880]   While they are saying, "Peace and safety," then destruction will come upon them, sudden
[00:11:02.880 --> 00:11:09.120]   like labor pains upon a woman with a child, and they will not escape.
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:13.720]   People who are going to hell did not decide to go to hell.
[00:11:13.720 --> 00:11:16.360]   They didn't shake their fist and reject God.
[00:11:16.360 --> 00:11:21.480]   It says that when they were saying, "Peace and safety," they are drifting.
[00:11:21.480 --> 00:11:25.040]   Which is the greatest tragedy of human history?
[00:11:25.040 --> 00:11:29.560]   That most people will find themselves under God's judgment because of sin.
[00:11:29.560 --> 00:11:31.360]   They didn't choose to be there.
[00:11:31.360 --> 00:11:33.680]   They didn't outright reject Him.
[00:11:33.680 --> 00:11:35.720]   They just drifted.
[00:11:35.720 --> 00:11:37.520]   They heard the message.
[00:11:37.520 --> 00:11:39.800]   They even professed it.
[00:11:39.800 --> 00:11:44.160]   But outside of just professing, there was no evidence of genuine faith, and it wasn't
[00:11:44.160 --> 00:11:45.920]   important enough.
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:51.220]   They were satisfied that they participated in the church, and that was it.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:55.320]   And so for the rest of their life, all they did was drift.
[00:11:55.320 --> 00:12:00.360]   While they are saying, "Peace and safety," while they are pursuing what everybody else
[00:12:00.360 --> 00:12:06.600]   pursues, while they are pursuing what everybody else desires, while they rejoice over everything
[00:12:06.600 --> 00:12:12.360]   else that everybody else rejoices over, while they are pursuing peace and safety, He said
[00:12:12.360 --> 00:12:16.720]   they will neglect their salvation, and they will not escape.
[00:12:16.720 --> 00:12:23.060]   Hebrews chapter 4, verse 1, it says, "Therefore let us fear, while a promise remains of entering
[00:12:23.060 --> 00:12:27.200]   His rest, and any one of you may seem to have come short of it."
[00:12:27.200 --> 00:12:33.120]   You know, I found that especially in our generation, the word "fear" is feared.
[00:12:33.120 --> 00:12:35.220]   The word "fear" is feared.
[00:12:35.220 --> 00:12:39.100]   Every time the word "fear" is mentioned, there is always a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:12:39.100 --> 00:12:42.340]   Doesn't the Bible say that love casts out fear?
[00:12:42.340 --> 00:12:43.940]   Aren't we saved by grace?
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:46.440]   Why would you keep saying this to fear?
[00:12:46.440 --> 00:12:48.660]   Because the Bible says it.
[00:12:48.660 --> 00:12:52.220]   Paul says to live out our salvation with fear and trembling.
[00:12:52.220 --> 00:12:56.760]   The chief end of man is to obey God and fear Him over and over again.
[00:12:56.760 --> 00:12:59.580]   We are commanded to fear Him.
[00:12:59.580 --> 00:13:04.660]   There is a healthy fear that keeps us away from danger.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:08.020]   If you get in a boat and you know the storm is coming, and you are afraid that if you
[00:13:08.020 --> 00:13:13.140]   get on this boat that you might drown, that's a good fear.
[00:13:13.140 --> 00:13:19.800]   If you go up to the skyscraper and there is no railing, and the platform is slippery,
[00:13:19.800 --> 00:13:24.140]   and that causes you to stay away from that platform, that's a good fear.
[00:13:24.140 --> 00:13:25.820]   You need that fear.
[00:13:25.820 --> 00:13:31.060]   If you live without any fear, you are not going to survive for long.
[00:13:31.060 --> 00:13:35.920]   The fear that the Word of God teaches us and warns us, it is for the purpose of keeping
[00:13:35.920 --> 00:13:39.360]   us in the narrow path.
[00:13:39.360 --> 00:13:46.060]   And yet in our generation, especially where you and I live, the idea of disturbing peace
[00:13:46.060 --> 00:13:48.560]   is disturbing.
[00:13:48.560 --> 00:13:53.520]   Any kind of sermon or message or community or small group that challenges the status
[00:13:53.520 --> 00:13:57.980]   quo of where we are, we get a pushback.
[00:13:57.980 --> 00:13:59.480]   That's not what God says.
[00:13:59.480 --> 00:14:00.480]   God is about love.
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.480]   God is about grace.
[00:14:01.480 --> 00:14:05.760]   And yet He says, "How will we escape?"
[00:14:05.760 --> 00:14:07.060]   He's not talking to non-Christians.
[00:14:07.060 --> 00:14:08.480]   He's not talking to Judaizers.
[00:14:08.480 --> 00:14:13.080]   He's talking to Christians who are drifting to their old way of life.
[00:14:13.080 --> 00:14:19.320]   How shall we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
[00:14:19.320 --> 00:14:26.560]   A lot of times, the neglecting happens because we allow doubts in our head.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:30.800]   It's been so long that you've had answered prayers in your life, that in the back of
[00:14:30.800 --> 00:14:34.720]   your head you're asking, "Is God really real?"
[00:14:34.720 --> 00:14:38.880]   You've been studying the Word of God, and you're at a church where the Word of God is
[00:14:38.880 --> 00:14:44.520]   exposited and is taught and memorized, but there's this nagging fear in your mind or
[00:14:44.520 --> 00:14:46.840]   doubt in the back of your mind.
[00:14:46.840 --> 00:14:50.120]   How can you be so sure?
[00:14:50.120 --> 00:14:53.740]   I know you believe it, and I know a lot of other people believe it, but I'm not sure
[00:14:53.740 --> 00:14:56.040]   if I completely believe it.
[00:14:56.040 --> 00:15:01.840]   And as a result of that, it doesn't have the kind of authority in your life.
[00:15:01.840 --> 00:15:09.840]   We allow certain doubts in our head because those doubts allow a certain type of lifestyle.
[00:15:09.840 --> 00:15:15.440]   In fact, one of the most honest confessions that I've heard from a sister years ago was
[00:15:15.440 --> 00:15:20.160]   she said, "You know, I didn't know the suffering that many people were going through."
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:21.760]   But that was not the honest confession.
[00:15:21.760 --> 00:15:26.840]   The honest confession was, "I didn't know because I didn't want to know."
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:30.480]   I didn't know because I didn't want to know, because I knew the moment that I dug and I
[00:15:30.480 --> 00:15:34.040]   found out how many people were suffering that it would make me feel guilty about what I
[00:15:34.040 --> 00:15:35.040]   have.
[00:15:35.040 --> 00:15:40.280]   So she turned it off, or she moved on, or she would make a tiny donation, just enough
[00:15:40.280 --> 00:15:43.920]   to calm her conscience, but never did she pursue this.
[00:15:43.920 --> 00:15:47.640]   And again, to me, it was one of the most honest confessions.
[00:15:47.640 --> 00:15:52.280]   She said, "I was callous because that's the way I wanted to be."
[00:15:52.280 --> 00:15:56.400]   See, he says here, how can we escape such a great salvation?
[00:15:56.400 --> 00:16:00.320]   After it was first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who had heard,
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:04.000]   and God also testified through signs and wonders and various miracles.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.280]   In other words, this gospel that you heard, it was so important that he says three things
[00:16:09.280 --> 00:16:10.680]   that he did to confirm it.
[00:16:10.680 --> 00:16:16.920]   First thing that he said was that he sent his son himself to speak.
[00:16:16.920 --> 00:16:21.680]   How often do we think to ourselves, "Only if God would speak to me audibly."
[00:16:21.680 --> 00:16:23.360]   How would it change you?
[00:16:23.360 --> 00:16:30.800]   If you went home today and God said, "Stop," or "Go," or whatever it is that you're asking
[00:16:30.800 --> 00:16:36.440]   for, if God audibly spoke to you, how would that change your response?
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:39.940]   I would assume that we would be a lot more obedient.
[00:16:39.940 --> 00:16:43.180]   We would take the Word of God a lot more seriously.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:48.000]   We would be a bit more careful about what we do and don't do.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:52.480]   But the reason why we don't respond that way, because we don't give the Word of God that
[00:16:52.480 --> 00:16:54.400]   kind of authority.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:17:00.000]   The Bible says the words that are contained here was the audible voice of God.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:07.080]   That in the past, God spoke through prophets in many ways, in many avenues, but in the
[00:17:07.080 --> 00:17:09.560]   new covenant, he spoke directly through his son.
[00:17:09.560 --> 00:17:15.200]   Hebrew chapter 1, 2, "In the last days he has spoken to us in his son, whom he appointed
[00:17:15.200 --> 00:17:18.900]   heir of all things, through whom also he made the world."
[00:17:18.900 --> 00:17:26.340]   Not only did God speak to us audibly through his son directly so that there is no confusion,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:28.860]   he took on human form.
[00:17:28.860 --> 00:17:30.840]   It wasn't just audible.
[00:17:30.840 --> 00:17:32.100]   He was there in his flesh.
[00:17:32.100 --> 00:17:33.400]   He walked among us.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:34.440]   He felt what he felt.
[00:17:34.440 --> 00:17:36.660]   He ate the food that we ate.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:37.660]   He was fatigued.
[00:17:37.660 --> 00:17:38.660]   He was tired.
[00:17:38.660 --> 00:17:39.660]   He was anxious.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:42.620]   He was tempted in every way, yet without sin.
[00:17:42.620 --> 00:17:49.120]   Not only did he speak to us audibly, he came and he took on our form.
[00:17:49.120 --> 00:17:50.940]   He says there is no confusion.
[00:17:50.940 --> 00:17:53.180]   He made it absolutely crystal clear.
[00:17:53.180 --> 00:17:58.580]   In fact, the early hearers of Jesus Christ, says Matthew 7, 28-29, "When Jesus had finished
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.820]   these words, the crowds were amazed at his teaching, for he was teaching them as one
[00:18:03.820 --> 00:18:08.300]   having authority and not as their scribes."
[00:18:08.300 --> 00:18:13.040]   I don't think, it doesn't explain to us how they knew, but they heard something different
[00:18:13.040 --> 00:18:14.700]   from Jesus.
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:18.480]   That they weren't, he wasn't just regurgitating what he heard.
[00:18:18.480 --> 00:18:23.740]   He wasn't just a messenger who came to give a message that somebody else told him.
[00:18:23.740 --> 00:18:26.580]   The son of God himself came.
[00:18:26.580 --> 00:18:29.100]   He wasn't saying, "My father says this."
[00:18:29.100 --> 00:18:33.300]   He spoke because he himself had authority.
[00:18:33.300 --> 00:18:35.620]   How shall we escape?
[00:18:35.620 --> 00:18:41.040]   If we neglect the son of God who came here and spoke to us directly.
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:45.680]   In Mark chapter 12, 1-11, Jesus gives this parable about this vineyard owner who planted
[00:18:45.680 --> 00:18:50.700]   a vineyard and he began to send his servants to go and speak to them.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:53.980]   Every one of them, they beat and they killed.
[00:18:53.980 --> 00:18:57.220]   So he thought, "They will not do that to my son.
[00:18:57.220 --> 00:19:00.060]   They know the consequence if they do that to my son."
[00:19:00.060 --> 00:19:02.100]   Because all the other servants, they didn't take seriously.
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.700]   They didn't come with the same kind of authority.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.820]   So if I send my son, it's like me going.
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:07.980]   So I'm sure they will listen.
[00:19:07.980 --> 00:19:09.380]   But you know the parable.
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.540]   They come, not only do they beat him and reject him, they end up killing him.
[00:19:13.540 --> 00:19:18.300]   In verse 8, "They took him and killed him and threw him out of the vineyard.
[00:19:18.300 --> 00:19:20.340]   What will the owner of the vineyard do?
[00:19:20.340 --> 00:19:25.060]   He will come and destroy the vine growers and will give the vineyard to others.
[00:19:25.060 --> 00:19:26.500]   Have you not even read the scriptures?
[00:19:26.500 --> 00:19:30.340]   The stone which the builders rejected, this became the chief cornerstone.
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:34.700]   This came about from the Lord and it is marvelous in our eyes."
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:40.260]   He said that the message of the cross wasn't simply distributed.
[00:19:40.260 --> 00:19:42.820]   It wasn't simply printed.
[00:19:42.820 --> 00:19:44.880]   The Son of God himself came.
[00:19:44.880 --> 00:19:46.020]   Why did he come to do that?
[00:19:46.020 --> 00:19:48.940]   Obviously, he came to be crucified and take away our sins.
[00:19:48.940 --> 00:19:52.860]   But everything that he said, he said directly from his mouth.
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.740]   We can understand if there was misunderstanding.
[00:19:55.740 --> 00:19:58.780]   We may be able to understand and excuse it if it was vague.
[00:19:58.780 --> 00:20:05.580]   In other words, he's saying, "How can you escape when Jesus himself spoke out of his
[00:20:05.580 --> 00:20:07.980]   mouth?"
[00:20:07.980 --> 00:20:15.500]   Not only did he speak directly, number two, it was confirmed to us by those who heard.
[00:20:15.500 --> 00:20:21.340]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 3-8, Paul says, "For I delivered to you as of first importance
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:22.700]   what I also received."
[00:20:22.700 --> 00:20:27.220]   In other words, before we go on any further than that, Paul says, "Of all the things
[00:20:27.220 --> 00:20:29.980]   that I'm saying, this is the most important."
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.380]   And this is true for every Christian.
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:37.420]   No matter what is going on in your life, there's nothing more important than what Paul is saying
[00:20:37.420 --> 00:20:39.180]   here.
[00:20:39.180 --> 00:20:40.180]   Nothing more important.
[00:20:40.180 --> 00:20:41.180]   I don't care.
[00:20:41.180 --> 00:20:46.540]   It's not that I don't care, but I don't care, right?
[00:20:46.540 --> 00:20:52.940]   No matter what it is that we're going through, it is not important than this.
[00:20:52.940 --> 00:20:56.380]   Whatever job problems you have, whatever marriage issues you have, whatever problems you have
[00:20:56.380 --> 00:21:01.500]   with your children, whatever business issues that you have, of first importance, because
[00:21:01.500 --> 00:21:03.820]   all of that stuff is temporary.
[00:21:03.820 --> 00:21:05.420]   There is a solution to all of that.
[00:21:05.420 --> 00:21:09.960]   When we get to heaven, there's no more crying, there's no more dying, there's no more sorrow.
[00:21:09.960 --> 00:21:15.580]   So whatever problem that we have, as difficult as it may be, it is temporary.
[00:21:15.580 --> 00:21:20.260]   And there is nothing more important than what Paul says here, "For I delivered to you as
[00:21:20.260 --> 00:21:23.620]   of first importance what I also received."
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:28.460]   That Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures, and that He was buried, and
[00:21:28.460 --> 00:21:31.740]   that He was raised on the third day according to the Scriptures, and that He appeared to
[00:21:31.740 --> 00:21:34.940]   Cephas, then to the Twelve.
[00:21:34.940 --> 00:21:39.780]   If He stopped there, He said He appeared to the disciples, He appeared to a few of the
[00:21:39.780 --> 00:21:44.820]   disciples, and now they are propagating this message of Jesus said He was going to be crucified,
[00:21:44.820 --> 00:21:48.100]   He was going to be resurrected, and the disciples are validating that.
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.020]   Now if He stopped there, that would have been enough.
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:55.340]   He goes further and says, "And after He appeared to more than five hundred brethren at one
[00:21:55.340 --> 00:22:00.680]   time, most of whom remain until now."
[00:22:00.680 --> 00:22:02.180]   You know how crazy this statement is?
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:05.780]   I mean, two thousand years removed, we look at this statement, we just kind of read it
[00:22:05.780 --> 00:22:08.620]   and say, "Oh, okay, He left a witness."
[00:22:08.620 --> 00:22:15.040]   Imagine this being said at the time that these people were living.
[00:22:15.040 --> 00:22:20.740]   If it wasn't true, Apostle Paul is a very, very foolish man, because all they had to
[00:22:20.740 --> 00:22:23.980]   do was say, "Let me meet one of these guys."
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:26.980]   And if they can't find him, it would completely invalidate what he said.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:32.620]   He said five hundred are eyewitnesses, and the majority of them are still living, but
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:34.220]   some have fallen asleep.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:35.500]   Only a few of them have fallen asleep.
[00:22:35.500 --> 00:22:39.660]   Then He appeared to James, then to all the apostles, and last of all, as to one untimely
[00:22:39.660 --> 00:22:43.060]   born, He appeared to me also.
[00:22:43.060 --> 00:22:48.520]   Now the reason why this is so important is because in every other religion, you have
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:51.500]   to believe in one guy.
[00:22:51.500 --> 00:22:55.260]   If you ever studied Buddhism, you know that there's one man named Gautama.
[00:22:55.260 --> 00:22:57.200]   He was the guy who said he found enlightenment.
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:23:01.260]   He didn't talk about all the details, he just said he found enlightenment.
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:05.420]   Or he kind of referred to it, and then his disciples went around and propagated this
[00:23:05.420 --> 00:23:06.420]   message.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:11.140]   And what's interesting about Buddhism is that Buddhism looks very different from country
[00:23:11.140 --> 00:23:12.500]   to country.
[00:23:12.500 --> 00:23:17.860]   It just kind of took a life of its own, and they just kind of started to have basic teaching,
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.260]   but it was all based upon supposedly this one man.
[00:23:20.260 --> 00:23:23.900]   So whether you believe him or don't believe him, everything falls.
[00:23:23.900 --> 00:23:28.820]   Joseph Smith found the tablet, and so whether you believe him or don't believe him, everything
[00:23:28.820 --> 00:23:32.660]   falls and rises based upon if you believe him or not.
[00:23:32.660 --> 00:23:38.900]   Muhammad, one guy, had a vision, and all of a sudden, he has this new prophecy, and he
[00:23:38.900 --> 00:23:43.580]   turns the world upside down, and all of it is based upon this one man and what he says.
[00:23:43.580 --> 00:23:49.500]   Just in case, just in case somebody would come and say, "Well, Jesus is a crazy guy.
[00:23:49.500 --> 00:23:55.280]   I know he had a large following, and I know his disciples loved him, but he's just one
[00:23:55.280 --> 00:23:56.280]   crazy guy."
[00:23:56.280 --> 00:24:02.940]   And he made sure, because it's easy to nullify one guy and say, "Well, the whole thing is
[00:24:02.940 --> 00:24:03.940]   nullified."
[00:24:03.940 --> 00:24:08.460]   He made sure that he left a witness with his disciples, and then again for 500 other people.
[00:24:08.460 --> 00:24:14.220]   And what's the craziest thing about this is that even secular scholars today, even those
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:23.260]   who reject the resurrection, nobody refutes the fact that the early church believed it
[00:24:23.260 --> 00:24:24.620]   because of what happened.
[00:24:24.620 --> 00:24:29.860]   Because all of a sudden, the Jews and the Gentiles, the Romans and the Jewish community,
[00:24:29.860 --> 00:24:32.860]   all of a sudden were calling each other brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:38.100]   You had Matthew, the tax collector, that they hated, became one of the first apostles.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:42.940]   I mean, humanly speaking, anywhere he went, the Jews would have thrown rocks at this guy.
[00:24:42.940 --> 00:24:48.260]   But he becomes one of the first apostles that God uses to establish the early church.
[00:24:48.260 --> 00:24:50.580]   Crazy things were happening in the early church.
[00:24:50.580 --> 00:24:53.820]   Some people say, "Oh, it's because they were poor, and Jesus fed the poor."
[00:24:53.820 --> 00:24:55.980]   If you look at it, there's aristocrats.
[00:24:55.980 --> 00:25:03.140]   There are very, very wealthy people, all mixed group of people.
[00:25:03.140 --> 00:25:06.700]   Nobody refutes that the early church believed it.
[00:25:06.700 --> 00:25:11.820]   But if they're going to acknowledge that, they have to explain then what happened.
[00:25:11.820 --> 00:25:15.860]   So you have some theories that Jesus had a twin brother and he faked people out, or he
[00:25:15.860 --> 00:25:19.380]   was a mass hypnotist, or he didn't really die.
[00:25:19.380 --> 00:25:24.420]   He just kind of had a light heart attack, and then he just came back to life because
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:26.420]   they refuse.
[00:25:26.420 --> 00:25:27.660]   And the Bible makes that clear.
[00:25:27.660 --> 00:25:31.820]   The reason why they refuse is because they love the darkness rather than the light.
[00:25:31.820 --> 00:25:38.100]   So if they're going to embrace the darkness, they have to justify the darkness, even though
[00:25:38.100 --> 00:25:41.060]   it makes no sense.
[00:25:41.060 --> 00:25:44.940]   This message was this important.
[00:25:44.940 --> 00:25:47.440]   What Jesus came to do is of first importance.
[00:25:47.440 --> 00:25:50.540]   So he spoke it himself.
[00:25:50.540 --> 00:25:52.140]   He didn't just send a messenger.
[00:25:52.140 --> 00:25:53.540]   He didn't just speak audibly.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:54.680]   He came.
[00:25:54.680 --> 00:25:58.140]   So today, when we say, "What is God like?"
[00:25:58.140 --> 00:26:00.340]   We don't have to imagine.
[00:26:00.340 --> 00:26:03.580]   We don't have to imagine God to be some cloud.
[00:26:03.580 --> 00:26:08.820]   We don't need to draw him that way because he came to us, and he left witnesses with
[00:26:08.820 --> 00:26:11.380]   his followers.
[00:26:11.380 --> 00:26:18.260]   In Luke chapter 1, 1 through 4, Luke is writing a detailed account of what happened in the
[00:26:18.260 --> 00:26:23.740]   early church to a man named Theophilus, possibly a Roman official.
[00:26:23.740 --> 00:26:27.980]   And this is what he says, "Inasmuch as many have undertaken to compile an account of the
[00:26:27.980 --> 00:26:32.440]   things accomplished among us, just as they were handed down to us by those who from the
[00:26:32.440 --> 00:26:36.340]   beginning were eyewitnesses and servants of the word."
[00:26:36.340 --> 00:26:43.020]   Luke being a physician took his discipline, and he went around, and he started to jot
[00:26:43.020 --> 00:26:48.380]   down, just like a historian would, to jot down the history of Christianity.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.300]   It seemed fitting for me as well, having investigated everything carefully from the beginning, to
[00:26:52.300 --> 00:26:56.800]   write it out for you in consecutive order, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may
[00:26:56.800 --> 00:27:00.260]   know the exact truth about the things you have been taught.
[00:27:00.260 --> 00:27:04.380]   Luke is the author of the Gospel of Luke and Acts.
[00:27:04.380 --> 00:27:10.420]   And those two letters were written specifically to give account, historical account.
[00:27:10.420 --> 00:27:16.740]   So he went and began to interview those people who saw Christ, the early apostles, and what
[00:27:16.740 --> 00:27:17.820]   was being done.
[00:27:17.820 --> 00:27:19.660]   And so Luke and Acts is that account.
[00:27:19.660 --> 00:27:23.580]   And obviously Matthew, Mark, and John is also an account.
[00:27:23.580 --> 00:27:26.620]   But Luke starts his letters this way.
[00:27:26.620 --> 00:27:33.620]   He left irrefutable evidence of Christ.
[00:27:33.620 --> 00:27:35.580]   Now why is this so important?
[00:27:35.580 --> 00:27:40.260]   Because, just like that sister I told you made an honest confession, "I am ignorant
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:43.260]   because I chose to be ignorant."
[00:27:43.260 --> 00:27:48.820]   You and I lived during a period where we have access to the truth like no other generation
[00:27:48.820 --> 00:27:52.540]   before us, ever.
[00:27:52.540 --> 00:27:57.060]   And I remember early years preparing for sermons, I mentioned to you, like back then I thought
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:28:01.340]   it was, you know, like I actually moved to La Mirada just so that I can be closer to
[00:28:01.340 --> 00:28:03.140]   the library.
[00:28:03.140 --> 00:28:05.500]   Because I needed to be in the library to get to the reference books.
[00:28:05.500 --> 00:28:09.980]   And some of you guys may remember the duodecimal system, right?
[00:28:09.980 --> 00:28:16.660]   Anybody who, any response, I know how old you are, right?
[00:28:16.660 --> 00:28:19.540]   So some of you guys know, they got rid of that now, right?
[00:28:19.540 --> 00:28:22.900]   You have to go find a duodecimal system and find it, and you got to go where it is, and
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:23.900]   then go.
[00:28:23.900 --> 00:28:26.900]   If you happen to be a big library, you got to walk a while, get the books, bring it back
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:27.900]   to the table.
[00:28:27.900 --> 00:28:31.980]   You know, I remember back then if I had a question about the Bible, I had to wait till
[00:28:31.980 --> 00:28:35.980]   I made an appointment with my professor, and I would go in and ask him a question.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:39.260]   Sometimes it would take two weeks just to ask him a question.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:44.620]   I mean, today I do all my sermon prep right in front of my computer.
[00:28:44.620 --> 00:28:47.460]   And I just type in, you know.
[00:28:47.460 --> 00:28:51.020]   And sometimes you guys ask me questions, and then I say, "I'll get back to you," and I
[00:28:51.020 --> 00:28:52.020]   just Google it, and then I...
[00:28:52.020 --> 00:28:55.220]   I was like, "I wonder why you can't Google it."
[00:28:55.220 --> 00:28:58.900]   But I Google it, and I send it right back to you like I did it myself, right?
[00:28:58.900 --> 00:29:00.860]   That's how easy it is, right?
[00:29:00.860 --> 00:29:07.380]   We have access to the truth like no other generation.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:15.500]   And yet, there is more doubt and more drifting and more neglecting in our generation than
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:21.100]   any other generation, simply because it's easy.
[00:29:21.100 --> 00:29:22.540]   It's easy.
[00:29:22.540 --> 00:29:25.560]   So we are okay with superficial faith.
[00:29:25.560 --> 00:29:28.240]   We are okay with superficial devotion.
[00:29:28.240 --> 00:29:33.620]   And then whenever we have even a slight bit of doubt, we allow that to linger and use
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:37.540]   that as an excuse of why we don't pay attention.
[00:29:37.540 --> 00:29:40.600]   There's a huge difference between questioning and asking questions.
[00:29:40.600 --> 00:29:45.060]   And I would never discourage anybody from asking questions, because I'm a firm believer.
[00:29:45.060 --> 00:29:50.820]   I believe what I believe and what I profess to be absolutely true, that any genuine pursuit
[00:29:50.820 --> 00:29:55.140]   of truth, genuine pursuit of truth, will lead you to God.
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:29:57.500]   I believe that with all my heart.
[00:29:57.500 --> 00:30:03.620]   If you are genuinely pursuing truth, but when you are questioning, there is no answer for
[00:30:03.620 --> 00:30:07.060]   that, because when you are questioning, you already made up your mind.
[00:30:07.060 --> 00:30:10.140]   And if you find an answer, you'll find another question.
[00:30:10.140 --> 00:30:11.860]   And if you find an answer, you'll find another question.
[00:30:11.860 --> 00:30:16.660]   I don't know how many times I counsel somebody who says, "You know what, I don't know if
[00:30:16.660 --> 00:30:17.900]   I really believe this."
[00:30:17.900 --> 00:30:19.780]   And then they'll throw it out there, and I say, "Well, great.
[00:30:19.780 --> 00:30:21.580]   There's some great material for you to read."
[00:30:21.580 --> 00:30:26.900]   And I give it to them, and they never read it.
[00:30:26.900 --> 00:30:30.100]   You just told me that you're about to walk away from your faith because you have this
[00:30:30.100 --> 00:30:35.540]   doubt, and you won't even take ten minutes to read this material to find out if it's
[00:30:35.540 --> 00:30:37.060]   true?
[00:30:37.060 --> 00:30:43.020]   That says a lot more about your questioning than your question, because you're looking
[00:30:43.020 --> 00:30:44.620]   for an excuse to walk away.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.100]   You're looking for an excuse.
[00:30:48.100 --> 00:30:54.180]   But if we pursue the truth, Scripture says God left His imprint in creation.
[00:30:54.180 --> 00:30:55.760]   God gave special revelation.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:30:57.680]   He himself spoke directly.
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:04.700]   And then He left His imprint among His disciples in the early church, and He gave us His word.
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:11.100]   And to not to examine that, not to carefully look into that, and simply say, "I doubt."
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:15.940]   You're not doubting because you've examined, and you looked, and you asked, and your end
[00:31:15.940 --> 00:31:19.300]   conclusion was it didn't make sense.
[00:31:19.300 --> 00:31:22.340]   You just doubted because you wanted to.
[00:31:22.340 --> 00:31:25.080]   That sounds a lot like Romans chapter 1.
[00:31:25.080 --> 00:31:32.040]   They refuse the truth because they prefer the darkness, and doubting justifies the darkness.
[00:31:32.040 --> 00:31:34.100]   And that's what He is saying.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:37.700]   How can you escape if you neglect such a great salvation that was spoken directly from His
[00:31:37.700 --> 00:31:44.540]   Son, that was given to His disciples in the early church and left a clear imprint?
[00:31:44.540 --> 00:31:49.340]   That's why Paul says in Philippians chapter 1, 20 through 26, "For to me to live is Christ,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.900]   and to die is gain."
[00:31:51.900 --> 00:31:55.900]   If I am to live on the flesh, this will mean fruitful labor for me, and I do not know which
[00:31:55.900 --> 00:31:59.500]   to choose, but I am hard-pressed from both directions.
[00:31:59.500 --> 00:32:03.340]   Having a desire to depart and be with Christ, for that is very much better, yet to remain
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:06.620]   in the flesh is more necessary for your sake.
[00:32:06.620 --> 00:32:10.340]   Convinced of this, I know that I will remain and continue with you all for your progress
[00:32:10.340 --> 00:32:11.340]   and joy in the faith.
[00:32:11.340 --> 00:32:17.780]   In other words, Apostle Paul says, "If you're asking me, it's better for me to go."
[00:32:17.780 --> 00:32:22.260]   We look at something like that where Apostle Paul says, "Man, this guy's extreme.
[00:32:22.260 --> 00:32:24.500]   Of course he's an apostle.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:26.700]   He has special gifts.
[00:32:26.700 --> 00:32:29.380]   Of course he would be this extreme."
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.820]   But clearly, this is not for average Christians.
[00:32:33.820 --> 00:32:36.660]   Think about what we sing.
[00:32:36.660 --> 00:32:41.340]   Think about what it is that you and I profess to believe.
[00:32:41.340 --> 00:32:46.260]   What Paul is saying here is a logical response.
[00:32:46.260 --> 00:32:52.420]   I have a room filled with people who say that all of this is vanity.
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:54.620]   They're all perishing.
[00:32:54.620 --> 00:32:58.200]   Once we die, there's judgment, inasmuch as it is appointed for all man to die once.
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.940]   After this comes judgment.
[00:33:00.940 --> 00:33:02.540]   We're not talking about getting a better job.
[00:33:02.540 --> 00:33:05.820]   We're not talking about consequence of our children not making it to the school that
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:07.020]   they want to go to.
[00:33:07.020 --> 00:33:11.260]   We're talking about eternal consequences.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:17.180]   What Paul is saying here is that in light of this message, in light of what he has seen,
[00:33:17.180 --> 00:33:24.820]   in light of what he believes, everything else truly is rubbish.
[00:33:24.820 --> 00:33:28.060]   For every Christian, this is true.
[00:33:28.060 --> 00:33:30.620]   We're living in a sinful world.
[00:33:30.620 --> 00:33:33.460]   And there's sin that has affected us.
[00:33:33.460 --> 00:33:35.020]   It affects the way we feel.
[00:33:35.020 --> 00:33:36.560]   It affects the way we think.
[00:33:36.560 --> 00:33:38.340]   It affects our desires.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.940]   It affects our values.
[00:33:39.940 --> 00:33:42.060]   It affects what we want.
[00:33:42.060 --> 00:33:43.060]   It affects our hope.
[00:33:43.060 --> 00:33:44.940]   It affects everything.
[00:33:44.940 --> 00:33:51.380]   And the longer you live, the more you will see the effects of sin close up.
[00:33:51.380 --> 00:33:55.780]   When you're younger, you think that maybe if I did this, maybe if I got a better job
[00:33:55.780 --> 00:33:59.380]   and a better bank account, maybe if I did this, maybe if I met the right guy, maybe
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:01.300]   if we had these kind of children.
[00:34:01.300 --> 00:34:06.500]   And you're thinking this, but you know why people go through a midlife crisis?
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:10.100]   Because they get to a certain point of age and they realize that everything that Bible
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.860]   said was true.
[00:34:13.860 --> 00:34:16.060]   Sin affects everything.
[00:34:16.060 --> 00:34:20.940]   And everything that you thought was valuable, and you fall into despair.
[00:34:20.940 --> 00:34:23.020]   If that's what you were pursuing.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:27.860]   Because all of a sudden, everything that you pursued, all of a sudden becomes a reality
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:29.220]   that truly was vanity.
[00:34:29.220 --> 00:34:30.700]   I was pursuing the wrong thing.
[00:34:30.700 --> 00:34:32.620]   Is this it?
[00:34:32.620 --> 00:34:35.980]   And so they go through a midlife crisis.
[00:34:35.980 --> 00:34:39.700]   But a wise person recognizes this truth and what we profess when we're young, just like
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:44.980]   we were talking about, that you don't wake up after you have drifted and failed for a
[00:34:44.980 --> 00:34:47.500]   period of time.
[00:34:47.500 --> 00:34:52.580]   You recognize the wisdom for what the Scripture says.
[00:34:52.580 --> 00:34:54.860]   And pay attention so that we do not drift.
[00:34:54.860 --> 00:34:59.740]   Third and finally, it says, "God also testifying with them, both by signs and wonders and by
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:03.860]   various miracles and by gifts of the Holy Spirit."
[00:35:03.860 --> 00:35:07.140]   Before we drift from the meaning of this, because one of these days I'm going to just
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:10.580]   devote my time in understanding signs, wonders, and miracles.
[00:35:10.580 --> 00:35:16.500]   But for today, I want to just make sure that we understand what he's saying here.
[00:35:16.500 --> 00:35:22.220]   What does it mean to be a sign of something?
[00:35:22.220 --> 00:35:23.220]   Just think for a second.
[00:35:23.220 --> 00:35:27.740]   He says, "Signs, miracles, signs and wonders and miracles."
[00:35:27.740 --> 00:35:31.140]   What is a sign?
[00:35:31.140 --> 00:35:32.140]   And don't think theologically.
[00:35:32.140 --> 00:35:33.820]   You guys are thinking too theologically.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:36.940]   Just think as a regular pedestrian.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:38.220]   I'll give you a hint.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:41.140]   What is a sign?
[00:35:41.140 --> 00:35:43.540]   It points to something.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:44.940]   Here comes a sign.
[00:35:45.340 --> 00:35:49.060]   Well, that sign is not there as a decoration.
[00:35:49.060 --> 00:35:52.580]   Sign is not there so it's like, "Wow, that square is perfect."
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:53.780]   That's not why it's there.
[00:35:53.780 --> 00:35:55.500]   The sign is there to serve a purpose.
[00:35:55.500 --> 00:35:59.100]   And that purpose is to point to something.
[00:35:59.100 --> 00:36:00.100]   It's to point to something.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.580]   So remember that.
[00:36:02.580 --> 00:36:07.140]   The reason why I say this is because a lot of times people look for signs and wonders
[00:36:07.140 --> 00:36:09.900]   to be wowed.
[00:36:09.900 --> 00:36:13.680]   They look at signs and wonders to be touched.
[00:36:13.680 --> 00:36:18.700]   But the purpose of signs and wonders is to point, is to direct.
[00:36:18.700 --> 00:36:23.860]   And he says, "Through signs and wonders and miracles," what did it point to?
[00:36:23.860 --> 00:36:26.400]   What did it direct the people to?
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:31.480]   To Christ and to who He is and what He has done.
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:33.580]   To validate what?
[00:36:33.580 --> 00:36:34.580]   That He's powerful?
[00:36:34.580 --> 00:36:35.580]   Yes.
[00:36:35.580 --> 00:36:39.260]   But why does His power need to be validated?
[00:36:39.260 --> 00:36:43.580]   Because He was the Son of God and because of what He'd come to do.
[00:36:43.580 --> 00:36:50.120]   The whole point of signs and wonders and miracles is to pay attention to what Christ was saying.
[00:36:50.120 --> 00:36:53.700]   He was trying to get us to validate what He was saying.
[00:36:53.700 --> 00:36:58.820]   And that's why the Scripture says about the Holy Spirit, John 15, 26, "When the Helper
[00:36:58.820 --> 00:37:03.940]   comes whom I will send to you from the Father, that is the Spirit of truth who proceeds from
[00:37:03.940 --> 00:37:06.460]   the Father, He will testify about," what?
[00:37:06.460 --> 00:37:08.020]   About me.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.620]   The Holy Spirit didn't come so that we can have tingly feelings, so that when we sing
[00:37:11.620 --> 00:37:14.100]   we can sing loud.
[00:37:14.100 --> 00:37:16.140]   There's nothing wrong with any of that.
[00:37:16.140 --> 00:37:22.500]   But the purpose of why the Holy Spirit was sent was so that it can point to Christ.
[00:37:22.500 --> 00:37:25.260]   And that's why the signs and wonders and miracles were taking place.
[00:37:25.260 --> 00:37:29.420]   And that's why it says John chapter 3, 1 and 2, "Now there was a man of the Pharisees named
[00:37:29.420 --> 00:37:31.260]   Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.
[00:37:31.260 --> 00:37:35.340]   This man came to Jesus by night and said to Him, 'Rabbi, we know that you have come from
[00:37:35.340 --> 00:37:40.500]   God as a teacher, for no one can do these signs that you do unless God is with him.'"
[00:37:40.500 --> 00:37:42.600]   That was his whole point.
[00:37:42.600 --> 00:37:45.220]   To validate what he was saying, to validate who he is.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:50.380]   Again in Acts 2, 22, Peter says, "Men of Israel, listen to these words, 'Jesus of Nazarene,
[00:37:50.380 --> 00:37:55.440]   a man attested to you by God with miracles and wonders and signs which God performed
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.940]   through him in your midst, just as you yourselves know.'"
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:02.180]   In other words, you may want to reject what he has said, you may want to reject what other
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:07.020]   people said, but how can you deny what you saw?
[00:38:07.020 --> 00:38:10.180]   It was for the purpose of validating Christ.
[00:38:10.180 --> 00:38:15.260]   And again in Matthew 9, 6, "So that you may know that the Son of Man has authority on
[00:38:15.260 --> 00:38:20.700]   earth to forgive sins, he said to the paralytic, 'Get up, pick up your bed, and go home.'"
[00:38:20.700 --> 00:38:24.540]   He didn't perform these miracles so that they could say, "Oh, you know, your life is hard,
[00:38:24.540 --> 00:38:27.300]   so I don't want you to be limping anymore.
[00:38:27.300 --> 00:38:31.100]   Oh, you're hungry, so I want you to be fed."
[00:38:31.100 --> 00:38:32.260]   All of these things are true.
[00:38:32.260 --> 00:38:34.640]   God calls us to be compassionate.
[00:38:34.640 --> 00:38:39.100]   But he says, "I perform these miracles so that you may know the real reason why I came,
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:41.780]   to forgive you of your sins."
[00:38:41.780 --> 00:38:48.540]   The primary and of most importance for every Christian is not the miracles, but what it
[00:38:48.540 --> 00:38:53.420]   points to, is Christ crucified.
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:39:00.620]   I know so many people who profess to have all kinds of gifts, who've seen all kinds
[00:39:00.620 --> 00:39:04.320]   of things, experienced all kinds of things with the Holy Spirit, who are no longer walking
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:07.160]   with God.
[00:39:07.160 --> 00:39:13.200]   And Jesus said, when Thomas saw the resurrected Christ, you know, he said, "Well, it's hard
[00:39:13.200 --> 00:39:15.920]   for me to believe, even though he's standing right there.
[00:39:15.920 --> 00:39:18.520]   Let me touch your scars."
[00:39:18.520 --> 00:39:22.940]   He allows him to touch his scars, puts his finger in his scars, and then when he realized
[00:39:22.940 --> 00:39:26.840]   that this was the resurrected Christ, he gets on his knees and he says, "My Lord and my
[00:39:26.840 --> 00:39:28.840]   God."
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:29.840]   My Lord and my God.
[00:39:29.840 --> 00:39:31.320]   But remember what Jesus says?
[00:39:31.320 --> 00:39:35.600]   "You believe because you have seen, but blessed are those who believe and yet they have not
[00:39:35.600 --> 00:39:38.160]   seen."
[00:39:38.160 --> 00:39:43.760]   So in other words, you believe because I'm standing in front of you.
[00:39:43.760 --> 00:39:47.600]   In other words, he's saying he left his imprint.
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:52.760]   He left his imprint of who he is, his resurrection, who he is all around us.
[00:39:52.760 --> 00:39:57.400]   If we pay attention very carefully, God is speaking.
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.240]   And he's speaking very clearly.
[00:40:00.240 --> 00:40:03.920]   And the reason why we don't listen, or the reason why we don't hear him, is not because
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:05.920]   he's not speaking.
[00:40:05.920 --> 00:40:10.480]   It's because we are cluttered in our life with noise.
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:15.160]   And so because there's so much noise around us, we say, "God, where are you?
[00:40:15.160 --> 00:40:17.280]   Why aren't you speaking?"
[00:40:17.280 --> 00:40:19.880]   Isn't that frustrating?
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:24.280]   I know, boyfriend, girlfriend, and husband and wife, you know, one of the most frustrating
[00:40:24.280 --> 00:40:30.640]   conversations is both of you are speaking, but nobody is listening.
[00:40:30.640 --> 00:40:33.520]   And you just speak louder and louder, thinking that if you speak louder, the other person
[00:40:33.520 --> 00:40:38.280]   will listen, but the other person listens even less.
[00:40:38.280 --> 00:40:45.040]   I've never experienced that in my life, but I know you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:40:45.040 --> 00:40:47.600]   And a lot of times we do that with God.
[00:40:47.600 --> 00:40:48.600]   Where are you?
[00:40:48.600 --> 00:40:51.160]   Why aren't you speaking?
[00:40:51.160 --> 00:40:58.360]   Not realizing that we have drowned out his voice with the things that we are engaged
[00:40:58.360 --> 00:41:00.000]   in.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:04.720]   Not only did the signs point to Christ, he gave that authority even to the apostles.
[00:41:04.720 --> 00:41:09.520]   In Acts 2.43, everyone kept feeling a sense of awe that many wonders and signs were taking
[00:41:09.520 --> 00:41:11.680]   place through the apostles.
[00:41:11.680 --> 00:41:16.080]   2 Corinthians 12.12, let me read one more last passage.
[00:41:16.080 --> 00:41:20.520]   Signs and true apostleship were performed among you with all perseverance by signs and
[00:41:20.520 --> 00:41:21.520]   wonders and miracles.
[00:41:21.520 --> 00:41:25.240]   All of these things took place to ultimately bring us to God.
[00:41:25.240 --> 00:41:33.520]   He says, and he finishes that with an exclamation mark, "According to his own will."
[00:41:33.520 --> 00:41:35.360]   That's his will.
[00:41:35.360 --> 00:41:41.760]   How often do you pray to know his will?
[00:41:41.760 --> 00:41:44.080]   Does God want you to have this job?
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:46.880]   Does God want you to go to this school?
[00:41:46.880 --> 00:41:49.800]   God wants you to date this guy or this girl?
[00:41:49.800 --> 00:41:52.080]   God wants you to marry this guy?
[00:41:52.080 --> 00:41:53.980]   Does God want you to invest here?
[00:41:53.980 --> 00:41:56.680]   How often do you ask to know the will of God?
[00:41:56.680 --> 00:42:01.400]   And the reason why we want to know the will of God is because we want his blessing.
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:04.120]   Because we're afraid that if we go against his will, God's not going to bless us.
[00:42:04.120 --> 00:42:08.720]   So ultimately, we're not really trying to surrender our will to God.
[00:42:08.720 --> 00:42:12.080]   We're trying to seek where God's will is so that we can find the blessing.
[00:42:12.080 --> 00:42:17.160]   So if I'm going to do this business, I want to make sure that God's will is this business
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:22.000]   because if I do his will, he's going to bless my life.
[00:42:22.000 --> 00:42:25.120]   God made it very clear what his will is.
[00:42:25.120 --> 00:42:27.820]   He says this is his will.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:31.440]   It is foolishness to those who are perishing, but to those who are being saved, it is the
[00:42:31.440 --> 00:42:32.440]   power of God.
[00:42:32.440 --> 00:42:38.080]   Paul says, "I resolve to know nothing but Christ crucified."
[00:42:38.080 --> 00:42:42.220]   To me, everything has become rubbish in light of knowing the surpassing knowledge of Jesus
[00:42:42.220 --> 00:42:43.220]   Christ.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:49.900]   He said, "I endure all things for the sake of the elect that they too may come to faith."
[00:42:49.900 --> 00:42:59.920]   So everything that Paul did, lived and died, was in accordance to God's will.
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:02.140]   We don't need to search.
[00:43:02.140 --> 00:43:06.420]   We don't need to ask questions because he made it crystal clear.
[00:43:06.420 --> 00:43:13.300]   If Christ crucified is not the primary passion in our life, you are outside of his will.
[00:43:13.300 --> 00:43:19.300]   No matter how successful you are, no matter how many verses you can quote, he says this
[00:43:19.300 --> 00:43:23.200]   is in accordance to the will of God.
[00:43:23.200 --> 00:43:31.020]   As I wrap up the message this morning, the book of Hebrews is so relevant to all of us,
[00:43:31.020 --> 00:43:36.260]   including myself, because I catch myself drifting all the time.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:40.580]   You know the benefit of having to preach every Sunday is that I have to be sober or else
[00:43:40.580 --> 00:43:44.060]   I have to be really good at faking it.
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:48.820]   So the benefit is that I have to be in the Word and I have to encourage and I have to
[00:43:48.820 --> 00:43:50.540]   catch myself, I have to examine myself.
[00:43:50.540 --> 00:43:55.380]   So there's an added benefit of being a pastor because it forces me to catch myself when
[00:43:55.380 --> 00:43:57.980]   I see myself drifting.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.940]   But this struggle is constant.
[00:44:02.940 --> 00:44:04.940]   It's constant.
[00:44:04.940 --> 00:44:12.740]   Concerns for my family, concern for my parents, concern for my children, concern even for
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:14.780]   the church at times.
[00:44:14.780 --> 00:44:21.140]   Concern about world affairs, about politics, about the economy, bank account, retirement,
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.140]   friends, leisure.
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:29.180]   I mean you have so much that we're blessed with.
[00:44:29.180 --> 00:44:36.300]   But then this blessing easily becomes a trap because we begin to rely on them.
[00:44:36.300 --> 00:44:42.780]   There's no desperation in our hearts because my bills will be paid whether I pray or not.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:47.620]   You know, things will go, things will be fine next year.
[00:44:47.620 --> 00:44:51.980]   I just won't be that passionate.
[00:44:51.980 --> 00:44:54.980]   But again, like I said, the benefit of being in front of the Word of God is the Word of
[00:44:54.980 --> 00:45:00.060]   God constantly judges the thoughts and intentions of my heart to not to drift.
[00:45:00.060 --> 00:45:05.300]   So if it's this hard for a pastor, I know how hard it is for you.
[00:45:05.300 --> 00:45:08.320]   I know how easily we can get entangled.
[00:45:08.320 --> 00:45:14.380]   I know how easily just having finals can cause you to drift and then drift for a long time.
[00:45:14.380 --> 00:45:18.140]   I know how easily getting married and being worried about your wife and husband, how that
[00:45:18.140 --> 00:45:20.900]   can easily entangle you and you disappear for a while.
[00:45:20.900 --> 00:45:27.740]   I know what it's like to have a kid and be sleep deprived and then just have no energy
[00:45:27.740 --> 00:45:31.020]   to do anything and then you just start drifting.
[00:45:31.020 --> 00:45:33.820]   It doesn't take a lot for us to drift.
[00:45:33.820 --> 00:45:35.660]   And this is why God puts us together.
[00:45:35.660 --> 00:45:40.780]   He says, "Consider how you may provoke one another on toward loving good deeds, especially
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:42.780]   as you see the day drawing near."
[00:45:42.780 --> 00:45:47.300]   As the world becomes darker and darker and they begin to embrace immoral things openly
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:53.860]   and publicly, if we do not build a community that is provoking one another so that we do
[00:45:53.860 --> 00:45:57.500]   not drift, we will drift.
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:01.220]   It's not we might drift, we're already drifting.
[00:46:01.220 --> 00:46:03.180]   So we have to commit.
[00:46:03.180 --> 00:46:06.860]   And that's why the book of Hebrews is so important to us.
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:08.500]   So we do not drift.
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:15.020]   How will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
[00:46:15.020 --> 00:46:18.740]   So my prayer is again, as we continue to go through the Hebrews, one, that we recognize
[00:46:18.740 --> 00:46:21.060]   how great the salvation is.
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:26.820]   And secondly, once we recognize that, we do everything in our power to not drift.
[00:46:26.820 --> 00:46:29.100]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
