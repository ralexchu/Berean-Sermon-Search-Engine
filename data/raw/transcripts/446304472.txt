[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hi, my name is Caleb.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.400]   Yeah, as far as I can remember,
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:09.140]   church was a really important part of my life
[00:00:09.140 --> 00:00:11.480]   and I don't remember many Fridays,
[00:00:11.480 --> 00:00:14.040]   Friday nights of my life that weren't at church.
[00:00:14.040 --> 00:00:15.440]   I learned a lot about the importance
[00:00:15.440 --> 00:00:17.080]   of reading the Bible in prayer
[00:00:17.080 --> 00:00:19.560]   and that my life was meant to glorify God.
[00:00:19.560 --> 00:00:21.200]   I learned that Jesus Christ died on the cross
[00:00:21.200 --> 00:00:24.800]   and was resurrected, granting mercy on my soul.
[00:00:24.800 --> 00:00:27.200]   These things were things that I really easily accepted,
[00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:29.200]   but they actually meant very little to me.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:30.040]   Before I met the Lord,
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:32.440]   there were only a few things on my mind,
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.080]   mostly being seen in a certain light by my peers
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.720]   and indulging in the satisfactions
[00:00:36.720 --> 00:00:38.120]   that the world had to offer.
[00:00:38.120 --> 00:00:40.800]   A few months ago, I remember my small group leader
[00:00:40.800 --> 00:00:43.200]   telling me that I was really similar to his wife
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.720]   because we both didn't care what people thought of us.
[00:00:46.720 --> 00:00:48.560]   I laughed at myself because it's really true
[00:00:48.560 --> 00:00:50.720]   and also very false.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:53.040]   Because growing up in the church,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.600]   without knowing God, all I really did
[00:00:54.600 --> 00:00:56.520]   was seek the approval of others.
[00:00:56.520 --> 00:00:58.580]   And usually I wanted people to see me
[00:00:58.580 --> 00:01:00.000]   as someone who actually didn't care.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:02.080]   So it was like, you know.
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.840]   But yeah, I tried my best in Awana
[00:01:03.840 --> 00:01:05.960]   because I wanted to be ahead of everyone
[00:01:05.960 --> 00:01:07.600]   in memorizing scripture,
[00:01:07.600 --> 00:01:10.240]   but not really because I wanted to know the word of God.
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.640]   Yeah, the summary of my pride
[00:01:12.640 --> 00:01:15.160]   is that I wanted to be honored and respected by others
[00:01:15.160 --> 00:01:16.520]   while desperately trying to protect
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:18.560]   the brokenness that lay beneath.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.840]   As good as I looked to the world, it was only skin deep.
[00:01:20.840 --> 00:01:22.560]   I was constantly trying to mask the fear,
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:24.880]   weakness, and foolishness with confidence,
[00:01:24.880 --> 00:01:26.680]   strength, and intelligence.
[00:01:26.820 --> 00:01:30.300]   John 3 says that men love the darkness rather than the light.
[00:01:30.300 --> 00:01:32.740]   The darkness had offered security, discretion,
[00:01:32.740 --> 00:01:34.660]   and ways for me to indulge in my wicked desires
[00:01:34.660 --> 00:01:36.180]   without the judgment.
[00:01:36.180 --> 00:01:37.580]   As much as I heard at church
[00:01:37.580 --> 00:01:39.320]   that repentance and accountability
[00:01:39.320 --> 00:01:40.780]   were essential to the believer,
[00:01:40.780 --> 00:01:42.620]   I had no desire to be holy.
[00:01:42.620 --> 00:01:45.180]   To come into the light and have my deeds exposed
[00:01:45.180 --> 00:01:47.980]   was absolutely contrary to my character.
[00:01:47.980 --> 00:01:49.420]   Freshman year of college,
[00:01:49.420 --> 00:01:50.940]   I arrived at Bermuda Community Church
[00:01:50.940 --> 00:01:53.740]   and sat through a sermon on the holiness of God.
[00:01:53.740 --> 00:01:56.020]   There I was compared to a cooler of moldy rice
[00:01:56.020 --> 00:01:59.480]   and I was told that my sin wasn't just distasteful to God
[00:01:59.480 --> 00:02:02.240]   but utterly repelling to his character.
[00:02:02.240 --> 00:02:04.400]   The pastor continued on about some other stuff
[00:02:04.400 --> 00:02:06.200]   but the image stuck in my brain
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:08.480]   that I was disgusting to God.
[00:02:08.480 --> 00:02:10.000]   Everything that I spent my entire life
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:13.440]   trying to hide from the world is clearly seen by God.
[00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:15.320]   God is not mocked, he's not fooled,
[00:02:15.320 --> 00:02:18.080]   there's nothing that's hidden from him.
[00:02:18.080 --> 00:02:20.400]   And the only rational, logical thing to do
[00:02:20.400 --> 00:02:23.040]   is to throw disgusting things away.
[00:02:23.040 --> 00:02:24.800]   But God, while I was yet a sinner,
[00:02:24.800 --> 00:02:26.100]   ignorant to his love,
[00:02:26.100 --> 00:02:28.400]   sent his son to die for me to make me clean.
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.160]   That night, I repented of my sins,
[00:02:32.160 --> 00:02:34.180]   trusting that the death and resurrection of Christ
[00:02:34.180 --> 00:02:35.380]   covered my sins.
[00:02:35.380 --> 00:02:37.640]   He's my Lord and my Savior
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:41.220]   and I desire to live under his Lordship.
[00:02:41.220 --> 00:02:42.900]   So people ask me why I'm getting baptized now
[00:02:42.900 --> 00:02:44.560]   in our freshman year
[00:02:44.560 --> 00:02:46.500]   and I can plainly see that it is still my pride
[00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:47.900]   that clings so tightly to me.
[00:02:47.900 --> 00:02:50.900]   Now why admit to people that as a middle schooler
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:53.540]   I didn't know anything about being saved
[00:02:53.540 --> 00:02:55.500]   or why tell people that I was still
[00:02:55.500 --> 00:02:57.500]   just being a people pleaser?
[00:02:57.500 --> 00:03:01.300]   Deep down, even though I knew that I was not saved
[00:03:01.300 --> 00:03:04.480]   when I was baptized,
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:06.220]   I refused the thought of baptism
[00:03:06.220 --> 00:03:07.860]   for the sake of my own ego.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.520]   I'm being baptized today because of my desire
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:10.900]   to be obedient to the Lord,
[00:03:10.900 --> 00:03:12.100]   it's my ultimate desire
[00:03:12.100 --> 00:03:16.700]   and it's greater than my desire for self-preservation.
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:18.380]   I want to glorify God with my life
[00:03:18.380 --> 00:03:19.900]   because of his love for me.
[00:03:19.900 --> 00:03:23.060]   I continue to see the transformative power of God in my life
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.780]   meaning that he has replaced a heart that wanted self-glory
[00:03:27.780 --> 00:03:30.140]   to a heart that desires his glory.
[00:03:30.140 --> 00:03:32.940]   Desires I never had, deep accountability,
[00:03:32.940 --> 00:03:36.060]   true humility, genuine repentance,
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:38.960]   authentic love are now mine through the person of Christ.
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.500]   Ephesians 4 says to put off the old self,
[00:03:43.500 --> 00:03:45.900]   corrupt their deceitful desires
[00:03:45.900 --> 00:03:48.660]   to be renewed in the mind and put on the old self.
[00:03:48.660 --> 00:03:50.360]   I daily struggle with my old self.
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:56.060]   Daily struggle with my old self,
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:57.220]   I daily struggle with the desire
[00:03:57.220 --> 00:03:59.260]   for my own personal glorification.
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:01.460]   My prayer is that God will continue to discipline,
[00:04:01.460 --> 00:04:02.740]   rebuke and instruct me
[00:04:02.740 --> 00:04:04.220]   and that he will continue to humble me
[00:04:04.220 --> 00:04:06.100]   in my daily walk with him.
[00:04:06.100 --> 00:04:09.060]   All my life before Christ,
[00:04:09.060 --> 00:04:11.300]   I feared that what people would say if they,
[00:04:11.300 --> 00:04:13.540]   what would people think if they saw my sin?
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:16.180]   My identity was rooted in the fear of man.
[00:04:16.180 --> 00:04:18.020]   However, God, our holy perfect creator
[00:04:18.020 --> 00:04:19.380]   sees my sin perfectly,
[00:04:19.380 --> 00:04:22.300]   has accepted me and covered me
[00:04:22.300 --> 00:04:23.900]   with the righteousness of his son
[00:04:23.900 --> 00:04:26.740]   in whom I have received my true identity, a child of God.
[00:04:26.740 --> 00:04:31.260]   Ephesians 5, 13 and 14 says,
[00:04:31.260 --> 00:04:32.820]   but when anything is exposed to the light,
[00:04:32.820 --> 00:04:33.660]   it becomes visible,
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.760]   for anything that becomes visible is light.
[00:04:35.760 --> 00:04:37.980]   Therefore it says, awake, O sleeper,
[00:04:37.980 --> 00:04:40.060]   and arise from the dead and Christ will shine on you.
[00:04:40.060 --> 00:04:40.900]   Thank you.
[00:04:40.900 --> 00:04:44.060]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:45.060 --> 00:04:48.220]   (audience applauding)
[00:04:48.220 --> 00:05:05.580]   - Caleb, you understand when you go into the water,
[00:05:05.580 --> 00:05:07.220]   you're uniting with Christ and his death.
[00:05:07.220 --> 00:05:08.060]   When you come out,
[00:05:08.060 --> 00:05:10.180]   you're uniting with his resurrected life.
[00:05:10.180 --> 00:05:11.340]   - Yep.
[00:05:11.340 --> 00:05:13.900]   - I baptize you in the name of the father, the son,
[00:05:14.060 --> 00:05:15.100]   and the holy spirit.
[00:05:15.100 --> 00:05:21.380]   (audience applauding)
[00:05:21.380 --> 00:05:24.540]   (audience applauding)
