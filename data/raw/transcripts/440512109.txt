[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   Hello everyone, welcome to another session of our study through the book of Ephesians.
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:17.040]   This is lesson 24 out of 25 lessons so we only have two weeks left.
[00:00:17.040 --> 00:00:21.400]   After this session we will be taking a break in the month of August and the next session
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:23.840]   will begin the first week of September.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:25.620]   So look out for signups.
[00:00:25.620 --> 00:00:30.840]   We will be starting a new book and so we'll be reorganizing the groups as well.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:34.120]   Let's take a moment to pray as we jump into tonight's Bible study.
[00:00:34.120 --> 00:00:35.120]   Let's pray.
[00:00:35.120 --> 00:00:37.840]   Our God we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:00:37.840 --> 00:00:48.520]   Lord when we think about our life, perhaps Lord we live with a lot of resources.
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:55.080]   Perhaps Lord we've accomplished various things in our lives but nevertheless we confess God
[00:00:55.080 --> 00:01:02.360]   we are always so dependent on you and God we are always so susceptible to various woes,
[00:01:02.360 --> 00:01:06.160]   to various failures and trials in our lives.
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:11.520]   And so God we want to pray that through your word and spirit you strengthen us and God
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:16.520]   that as we walk with you Lord you would guide our path and cause us Father Lord to stand
[00:01:16.520 --> 00:01:17.520]   firm in our faith.
[00:01:17.520 --> 00:01:19.920]   We want to thank you for this Bible study.
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:24.120]   Would you cause us to be fruitful to our mind, our heart, and to our lives.
[00:01:24.120 --> 00:01:25.120]   In Christ we pray.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:26.120]   Amen.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   Okay.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:34.240]   Let me take a moment to read to us the whole passage because the whole paragraph starting
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.800]   from verse 10 is an entire section together.
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:40.960]   And I split it up because of the length.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:44.760]   But it begins by saying finally be strong in the Lord and in the strength of his might.
[00:01:44.760 --> 00:01:50.280]   Put on the full armor of God so that you will be able to stand firm against the schemes
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:51.280]   of the devil.
[00:01:51.280 --> 00:01:55.880]   For our struggle is not against flesh and blood but against the rulers, against the
[00:01:55.880 --> 00:02:00.840]   powers, against the world forces of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of wickedness
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:03.480]   in the heavenly places.
[00:02:03.480 --> 00:02:08.320]   Therefore take up the full armor of God so that you will be able to resist in the evil
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:09.320]   day.
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.040]   And having done everything to stand firm, stand firm therefore having girded your loins
[00:02:14.040 --> 00:02:19.320]   with truth and having put on the breastplate of righteousness, having shod your feet with
[00:02:19.320 --> 00:02:22.040]   the preparation of the gospel of peace.
[00:02:22.040 --> 00:02:27.040]   In addition to all, taking up the shield of faith with which you will be able to extinguish
[00:02:27.040 --> 00:02:29.800]   all the flaming arrows of the evil one.
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:35.680]   And take the helmet of salvation and the sword of the spirit which is the word of God.
[00:02:35.680 --> 00:02:39.200]   With all prayer and petition pray at all times in the spirit.
[00:02:39.200 --> 00:02:43.640]   And with this in view be on the alert with all perseverance and petition for all the
[00:02:43.640 --> 00:02:44.640]   saints.
[00:02:44.640 --> 00:02:50.160]   And pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth to
[00:02:50.160 --> 00:02:56.680]   make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for which I am an ambassador in chains.
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:03:00.400]   That in proclaiming it I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
[00:03:00.400 --> 00:03:07.960]   As we take a moment to review and putting the paragraphs together we recall the significant
[00:03:07.960 --> 00:03:15.880]   point of the entire section that we live in a fierce spiritual battle.
[00:03:15.880 --> 00:03:23.240]   It is not as though hey there may be some difficulties that may or may not come but
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:30.360]   rather we are fighting powerful forces constantly and what's more the schemes, the kind of attacks
[00:03:30.360 --> 00:03:34.880]   that are coming our way are in fact incredibly dangerous.
[00:03:34.880 --> 00:03:39.280]   And from the last passage we learn about who we are fighting.
[00:03:39.280 --> 00:03:40.280]   What are we fighting?
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:44.600]   And it's very clear scripture says we're not just specifically fighting one single
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:45.600]   human individual.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:51.080]   We're not just simply fighting flesh and blood as the passages say.
[00:03:51.080 --> 00:03:56.480]   But rather we are fighting spiritual forces, authorities and rulers, powerful beings.
[00:03:56.480 --> 00:03:58.080]   We're fighting darkness.
[00:03:58.080 --> 00:04:00.680]   We're fighting Satan.
[00:04:00.680 --> 00:04:06.960]   We're fighting the evil that exists not just simply out there but forces of darkness that
[00:04:06.960 --> 00:04:09.280]   are hostile to God.
[00:04:09.280 --> 00:04:16.000]   And what's more what we're trying to do is fight them, the ideologies, the false, perverted
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:18.880]   ways of thinking, right?
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:19.880]   Whatever it may be.
[00:04:19.880 --> 00:04:27.760]   And last time I half sarcastically joking and half in seriousness talked about how certain
[00:04:27.760 --> 00:04:32.480]   mantras of our day even could be very dark, right?
[00:04:32.480 --> 00:04:35.480]   Whatever we are, we're tempted to go against our conscience.
[00:04:35.480 --> 00:04:40.240]   Now as just a caveat, obviously we're not trying to be word police.
[00:04:40.240 --> 00:04:41.760]   If someone does say, "Hey, you know what?
[00:04:41.760 --> 00:04:42.760]   Yellow just do it," right?
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:47.600]   It's not as though we have to in every moment and every circumstance that those words are
[00:04:47.600 --> 00:04:49.840]   used correct it.
[00:04:49.840 --> 00:04:55.800]   But nevertheless we should be able to identify what are some ways of thinking that exist
[00:04:55.800 --> 00:05:02.880]   in and around us that are actually contrary to scripture and therefore yes it may be light,
[00:05:02.880 --> 00:05:08.320]   yes it may seem innocent, but very dangerous into our decision making.
[00:05:08.320 --> 00:05:11.200]   Very dangerous to our faithfulness to God.
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:16.440]   And we have to be actually thinking, "When was the last time I actually identified and
[00:05:16.440 --> 00:05:19.720]   guarded myself against such thinking?"
[00:05:19.720 --> 00:05:22.480]   Because we know they're all around us.
[00:05:22.480 --> 00:05:28.000]   What's more, to all these kinds of spiritual battles and the attacks that are there, what
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.120]   defense do we have?
[00:05:30.120 --> 00:05:34.160]   And last time we talked about really briefly, I didn't spend a whole lot of time on it,
[00:05:34.160 --> 00:05:38.040]   but we talked about the starting pieces of the armor of God.
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:43.720]   Now I want you to take a moment to check out this really cool graphic that I found on the
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:44.720]   internet.
[00:05:44.720 --> 00:05:51.400]   It's anime looking and I liked it because if you notice the gentleman is wearing a tie
[00:05:51.400 --> 00:05:54.080]   and a dress shirt and slacks.
[00:05:54.080 --> 00:05:57.280]   So I thought, "Wow, this is a good drawing."
[00:05:57.280 --> 00:06:00.000]   Now if you notice, all the pieces are there.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:05.880]   But remember at the review that the last time we talked about essential pieces that were
[00:06:05.880 --> 00:06:08.920]   close to the body.
[00:06:08.920 --> 00:06:12.200]   So you have the breastplate, the belt, and the shoes.
[00:06:12.200 --> 00:06:16.320]   So that's why I called it the starter pack.
[00:06:16.320 --> 00:06:21.920]   Some commentators tried to distinguish and saw patterns that these were essential pieces
[00:06:21.920 --> 00:06:28.200]   of defense or some of them more so just pretty much brought all these core things together.
[00:06:28.200 --> 00:06:31.600]   Some of them were thinking these are objective pieces that you're supposed to have for a
[00:06:31.600 --> 00:06:33.560]   long period of time.
[00:06:33.560 --> 00:06:36.800]   You could wear them for essential purposes.
[00:06:36.800 --> 00:06:40.080]   A belt, shoes, breastplate, essential purposes.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.840]   Now there's actually a lot to be said in observation about all these pieces.
[00:06:44.840 --> 00:06:49.640]   However, I would like to start off by just talking about the general feel and sentiment
[00:06:49.640 --> 00:06:54.760]   that you're supposed to get when the picture very clearly uses imagery for us.
[00:06:54.760 --> 00:06:56.440]   And that's why I looked up these photos.
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:06:59.720]   So I've actually as a heads up to you, lots of photos for today.
[00:06:59.720 --> 00:07:06.640]   It's because Apostle Paul is using the imagery to get across to you this major point.
[00:07:06.640 --> 00:07:11.440]   We are engaged in an incredible spiritual battle.
[00:07:11.440 --> 00:07:18.200]   Whether you like it or not, if your company, if your institution, if your country is at
[00:07:18.200 --> 00:07:23.600]   war, whether you like it or not, you're at war.
[00:07:23.600 --> 00:07:26.920]   And the question is, are you strong?
[00:07:26.920 --> 00:07:29.040]   Are you able to stand?
[00:07:29.040 --> 00:07:33.320]   Do you have the pieces necessary to be prepared for that battle?
[00:07:33.320 --> 00:07:38.480]   And a lot of times I think Christians, well intending, take a look at these photos and
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:42.840]   talk about the armor of God, but there's this question.
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.000]   Are you actually prepared?
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:47.600]   Are you willing to look like this?
[00:07:47.600 --> 00:07:52.280]   Have you vested or invested into purchasing these elements?
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.280]   Have you invested your time to make sure you can actually take it and then put it on?
[00:07:56.280 --> 00:07:58.400]   Or are you like this guy?
[00:07:58.400 --> 00:08:00.360]   A little sad looking.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:05.400]   He likes the idea, so he puts it on his t-shirt, but in the end, all he has going into war
[00:08:05.400 --> 00:08:07.440]   is a t-shirt.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:09.360]   Who looks strong to you?
[00:08:09.360 --> 00:08:11.320]   Who looks ready to you?
[00:08:11.320 --> 00:08:14.760]   This boy who has just a graphic on his shirt?
[00:08:14.760 --> 00:08:17.240]   Or the man who's put on armor?
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:20.400]   Okay, so that's the question at hand.
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:25.000]   But let's take a look at some of the pieces that we can observe and notice today.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:30.240]   There's a lot to observe about some of these pieces and elements.
[00:08:30.240 --> 00:08:34.560]   Now again, I made the point that it's not so much that you have to dissect every element
[00:08:34.560 --> 00:08:36.400]   because it's an imagery.
[00:08:36.400 --> 00:08:43.040]   But nevertheless, he does give, when you observe this, description about what the piece is
[00:08:43.040 --> 00:08:46.240]   and what it does in battle.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:50.960]   First one, he says we're supposed to take up the shield of faith.
[00:08:50.960 --> 00:08:53.040]   Shield of faith.
[00:08:53.040 --> 00:08:58.440]   With this piece of armory, can you imagine if somebody came in and they had strapped
[00:08:58.440 --> 00:09:01.440]   up to their arm a shield?
[00:09:01.440 --> 00:09:05.440]   You know that individual is ready to do something and that individual is ready.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:06.440]   He means business.
[00:09:06.440 --> 00:09:12.920]   Now what's really interesting is that when you take a look at the word shield, commentators
[00:09:12.920 --> 00:09:17.440]   have noticed that there are different words for a shield.
[00:09:17.440 --> 00:09:21.480]   There are different kinds of shield based on what kind of battle you're going to engage
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:22.480]   in.
[00:09:22.480 --> 00:09:27.480]   Are you going to be swiftly moving in hand-to-hand combat so you need something that allows you
[00:09:27.480 --> 00:09:28.480]   to be more agile?
[00:09:28.480 --> 00:09:29.480]   So you have a small shield.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:31.760]   There's a specific term for that.
[00:09:31.760 --> 00:09:38.400]   And here, the word is thurios, and that is typically referring to a large shield, perhaps
[00:09:38.400 --> 00:09:41.440]   more akin to what you see on the photo here.
[00:09:41.440 --> 00:09:45.560]   A shield that is wide enough to cover your entire body.
[00:09:45.560 --> 00:09:48.520]   Tall enough to cover the entire core of your body.
[00:09:48.520 --> 00:09:54.520]   And if you have seen movies that depict military battles, you've seen in the long ago, they
[00:09:54.520 --> 00:10:00.280]   have these formations where multiple shields are put together, creating a shell, so to
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:02.240]   speak, in defense.
[00:10:02.240 --> 00:10:06.720]   So we're thinking that when we're reading the imagery, clearly Apostle Paul is talking
[00:10:06.720 --> 00:10:11.040]   about faith that is so powerful to defend.
[00:10:11.040 --> 00:10:13.840]   So I want you to think about that question.
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:18.120]   How is your faith powerful to defend you?
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:23.800]   And what's more, the passage specifically says that it's powerful to extinguish the
[00:10:23.800 --> 00:10:26.360]   arrows of the evil one.
[00:10:26.360 --> 00:10:31.920]   What kind of arrows do we recall, have we experienced, have we seen in the scriptures
[00:10:31.920 --> 00:10:33.680]   that are thrown at us?
[00:10:33.680 --> 00:10:37.320]   And how is our faith supposed to defend against those things?
[00:10:37.320 --> 00:10:44.120]   Well, number one, we know temptation is very clearly arrows coming at us to cause a man,
[00:10:44.120 --> 00:10:50.120]   to cause a young lady to stumble because of temptation, for grief, for what?
[00:10:50.120 --> 00:10:54.200]   But it's that faith, when we see through the lens of faith, that says, you know what, the
[00:10:54.200 --> 00:10:59.520]   world, Satan is saying, look at this, look how beautiful and desirable, and yet through
[00:10:59.520 --> 00:11:04.200]   faith we say, no, as pretty as it may be, that's trash.
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:05.200]   Right?
[00:11:05.200 --> 00:11:10.520]   It's oppressive to say, look and admire the accomplishment this man has made, don't you
[00:11:10.520 --> 00:11:11.520]   want her life?
[00:11:11.520 --> 00:11:14.520]   And for us, by faith, to say, that's fleeting.
[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:18.280]   It's not worth much compared to what I believe.
[00:11:18.280 --> 00:11:22.160]   It's our faith that's going to be able to stand against temptation.
[00:11:22.160 --> 00:11:28.440]   And I think Satan is so deceiving, that Satan typically attacks us with fear.
[00:11:28.440 --> 00:11:31.080]   It's going to hurt so much.
[00:11:31.080 --> 00:11:35.160]   You're incapable, you can't do it, even if you have the spirit of God, even if you claim
[00:11:35.160 --> 00:11:38.160]   the name of Jesus, you can't do this.
[00:11:38.160 --> 00:11:42.600]   Satan is going to attack you and say, protect yourself.
[00:11:42.600 --> 00:11:45.880]   Only you, you alone can guard yourself.
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:51.560]   Self-preservation, despair, discouragement, the list goes on until all the fiery darts
[00:11:51.560 --> 00:11:53.600]   that come our way.
[00:11:53.600 --> 00:11:58.600]   So I have this photo of a Smart Pin soldier, right?
[00:11:58.600 --> 00:12:02.000]   Guarding against the fiery arrows.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:05.960]   But there's this question, like, when was the last time you felt like you were fighting
[00:12:05.960 --> 00:12:06.960]   that?
[00:12:06.960 --> 00:12:13.720]   Like, as I was praying and thinking through this, like, when was the last time I was actively
[00:12:13.720 --> 00:12:19.280]   engaged in a battle where I was like, you know, there's an arrow coming, I see it.
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:23.840]   And then you have to exercise what you believe, you have to exercise what you committed to,
[00:12:23.840 --> 00:12:28.880]   the doctrines of faith, but also, more importantly, your trust in God.
[00:12:28.880 --> 00:12:31.360]   I mean, what is faith?
[00:12:31.360 --> 00:12:38.960]   Yes, faith is belief in the unseen, but my faith is a trust in my Father.
[00:12:38.960 --> 00:12:44.800]   Where although the world says, you are this, and you are that, and you're not worth this,
[00:12:44.800 --> 00:12:47.800]   and you're not worth that, and you yourself may say that.
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:51.560]   But it's our faith that says, no, I trust my God's heart.
[00:12:51.560 --> 00:12:53.440]   I trust my God's love.
[00:12:53.440 --> 00:12:59.680]   I trust my God's value, as He works in my life.
[00:12:59.680 --> 00:13:01.240]   Next piece of the armor.
[00:13:01.240 --> 00:13:03.840]   The next piece of the armor is the helmet of salvation.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:06.120]   Oops, sorry, let's go, sorry.
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:08.480]   Anyway, the helmet of salvation.
[00:13:08.480 --> 00:13:14.200]   Now, when you think about the helmet of salvation, there are other descriptive words attached
[00:13:14.200 --> 00:13:18.520]   to it telling you all that it's supposed to do, yet at the same time, again, remember,
[00:13:18.520 --> 00:13:23.800]   we're talking about imagery, we're talking about battle, we're talking about the idea
[00:13:23.800 --> 00:13:27.200]   that when you're putting on a helmet and going into battle, what are you doing?
[00:13:27.200 --> 00:13:31.920]   Well, in order to think about that for a moment, I want you to think about this idea.
[00:13:31.920 --> 00:13:32.920]   Do we use helmets?
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:36.560]   Now, for most of you guys, you don't use helmets.
[00:13:36.560 --> 00:13:40.320]   I mean, the last time you probably used a helmet was when you rode your bike.
[00:13:40.320 --> 00:13:43.640]   And even when you do ride your bike, some of you guys don't wear your helmets.
[00:13:43.640 --> 00:13:49.040]   But as a matter of fact, if you engage in anything that is organized, organized sports,
[00:13:49.040 --> 00:13:50.040]   right?
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:55.800]   I mean, think about it, baseball, football, hockey, helmets are battle, okay?
[00:13:55.800 --> 00:14:00.840]   You engage in any kind of organized function that relates to first responders, you talk
[00:14:00.840 --> 00:14:05.200]   about firemen, you talk about construction workers, anything, right?
[00:14:05.200 --> 00:14:06.440]   There are helmets involved.
[00:14:06.440 --> 00:14:10.100]   You talk about even sports related to riding motorcycles.
[00:14:10.100 --> 00:14:13.680]   You talk about just about anything you're doing.
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.280]   Helmets are so important.
[00:14:16.280 --> 00:14:17.280]   Why?
[00:14:17.280 --> 00:14:21.480]   It's protecting you, the vital of your life, okay?
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:24.800]   Protecting the vital portion of your life.
[00:14:24.800 --> 00:14:28.400]   And again, I want to go to this idea then.
[00:14:28.400 --> 00:14:34.520]   I mentioned in a sermon not too long ago that I've been doing a research paper on suicidal
[00:14:34.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   thoughts.
[00:14:36.420 --> 00:14:42.960]   And what I've found is that not only in the statistics, but in my own observation of reading
[00:14:42.960 --> 00:14:50.220]   people's testimonies, the increased prevalence of people finding that there is no hope in
[00:14:50.220 --> 00:14:55.900]   this world, that perhaps they're failures, that perhaps their pain is way too large and
[00:14:55.900 --> 00:14:58.740]   too big to endure in this life.
[00:14:58.740 --> 00:15:05.480]   And the sad state of affairs is in so many people's testimonies, they have explicitly
[00:15:05.480 --> 00:15:09.360]   disclosed that they have had suicidal thoughts.
[00:15:09.360 --> 00:15:10.360]   Why?
[00:15:10.360 --> 00:15:16.680]   Because in terms of the temptation that comes into our mind, sometimes the most dangerous
[00:15:16.680 --> 00:15:20.160]   is when we're thinking that all is lost.
[00:15:20.160 --> 00:15:23.560]   There's no more to be done.
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:28.720]   And so, if you think about some of the greatest threats to people, it is a thought like this.
[00:15:28.720 --> 00:15:34.160]   "You are such a loser and there is no hope for you."
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:39.640]   But it's in our salvation that says there is hope for us in Christ.
[00:15:39.640 --> 00:15:43.480]   In our thoughts, things that are most hurtful and painful is that nobody loves you and no
[00:15:43.480 --> 00:15:44.480]   one cares.
[00:15:44.480 --> 00:15:47.680]   And if you were to disappear, no one would know.
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:53.440]   But our salvation says, "God loves me like he loves his perfect son."
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:58.400]   And in our salvation, he says, "Like the lost coin, like the lost sheep, like the prodigal
[00:15:58.400 --> 00:16:00.280]   son, God has searched."
[00:16:00.280 --> 00:16:04.320]   And scripture says, "We are useless."
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:06.880]   Salvation says, "No, we are redeemed.
[00:16:06.880 --> 00:16:14.880]   We are taken from that which is vanity, empty, and lost to redeemed and precious."
[00:16:14.880 --> 00:16:18.320]   The world may say to us, and Satan may say, "No one wants you."
[00:16:18.320 --> 00:16:23.200]   It is our salvation in Christ that says, "No, God wants you in his home.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   You have been adopted."
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:29.480]   If you look at salvation from the different angles, you realize that salvation has such
[00:16:29.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   powerful truths.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:33.160]   The gospel has such powerful truths.
[00:16:33.160 --> 00:16:35.560]   It will guard your vitals.
[00:16:35.560 --> 00:16:36.560]   Right?
[00:16:36.560 --> 00:16:39.600]   That's what we're talking about.
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:46.080]   And so, when you think about the summon of salvation, to hold onto our salvation is to
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:49.320]   hold onto our lives.
[00:16:49.320 --> 00:16:55.760]   And Satan, in his schemes and attacks upon you, we know it's coming.
[00:16:55.760 --> 00:17:00.200]   Why is it that those individuals who have been walking in the faith, sometimes leading
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:07.360]   churches, sometimes pastoring and shepherding the flock, are having suicidal thoughts?
[00:17:07.360 --> 00:17:13.680]   In recent history, it's a sad state of affairs that Christian leaders...
[00:17:13.680 --> 00:17:18.280]   Do I believe Satan and the spiritual battle is active in our day?
[00:17:18.280 --> 00:17:19.280]   Absolutely.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:27.160]   What's more, the third element of the armor, the sword of the spirit, which is the word
[00:17:27.160 --> 00:17:28.160]   of God.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:29.160]   Okay?
[00:17:29.160 --> 00:17:30.160]   Which is the word of God.
[00:17:30.160 --> 00:17:36.920]   And already, you can tell, when you think about the sword, what a powerful element.
[00:17:36.920 --> 00:17:44.040]   You recall this section began with commanding and challenging every believer to be strong
[00:17:44.040 --> 00:17:45.440]   and be able to stand.
[00:17:45.440 --> 00:17:51.640]   And what's interesting here, though, is that with the sword, the sword has multiple angles.
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:53.840]   I guess you could say it's double-edged.
[00:17:53.840 --> 00:17:58.320]   I guess you could also talk about it as it's both defensive and offensive.
[00:17:58.320 --> 00:18:01.120]   The sword of the spirit is powerful.
[00:18:01.120 --> 00:18:06.240]   Now what I want to show you is that this is the Greek term for the sword that is used
[00:18:06.240 --> 00:18:09.120]   here, is the word machaira.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:14.600]   And they are actually excavated artifacts of the kind of sword that existed in Christ's
[00:18:14.600 --> 00:18:15.600]   day in that area.
[00:18:15.600 --> 00:18:16.600]   And so you see these curved swords.
[00:18:16.600 --> 00:18:17.600]   They're not small little like pocket knives.
[00:18:17.600 --> 00:18:24.200]   It's like, take the sword and say, wait, hold on, take it out of your clip and use a little
[00:18:24.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   knife, right?
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:29.760]   For us in our day, I mean, who walks around with a machete, right?
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:33.640]   But essentially, it's the size of a machete.
[00:18:33.640 --> 00:18:37.320]   So what I'm talking about, the reason why I wanted you to see these images is because
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:42.840]   the way that the scripture is commanding us to be strong.
[00:18:42.840 --> 00:18:47.160]   Because perhaps in our day, we're not accustomed to this talk of military form and we're not
[00:18:47.160 --> 00:18:50.120]   accustomed to seeing armor and things like that.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:54.760]   We're not seeing some, we're not perhaps imagining the same thing, right?
[00:18:54.760 --> 00:18:59.840]   But clearly the scripture is talking about a powerful force when it comes to the word
[00:18:59.840 --> 00:19:00.840]   of God.
[00:19:00.840 --> 00:19:06.560]   It is a serious, it is a weighty responsibility to hold the word of God.
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:11.080]   And so scripture actually talks about if you are a pastor, or if you're speaking the words
[00:19:11.080 --> 00:19:15.280]   of God, you better get serious and do it accurately.
[00:19:15.280 --> 00:19:18.120]   It's kind of like having good discipline around dangerous tools.
[00:19:18.120 --> 00:19:24.360]   It's like having good discipline around fire, or knives, or using anything that could potentially
[00:19:24.360 --> 00:19:25.360]   cause harm.
[00:19:25.360 --> 00:19:26.360]   You need to cut that thing accurately.
[00:19:26.360 --> 00:19:27.360]   You need to handle it with care.
[00:19:27.360 --> 00:19:32.080]   You need to be accurate, okay?
[00:19:32.080 --> 00:19:36.000]   Do you have that kind of mentality when it comes to the scriptures?
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:39.800]   Because you realize, kind of like, well, you know, somewhere, sometime, I think the scripture
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:43.200]   maybe has said, right?
[00:19:43.200 --> 00:19:46.360]   You realize then you won't be able to be strong.
[00:19:46.360 --> 00:19:54.120]   And so we recognize that scripture has such an incredible power to both our defense and
[00:19:54.120 --> 00:19:59.840]   also the offense of taking down strongholds and all the rest, okay?
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:06.200]   So again, by way of review, just real briefly in terms of the armor of God, remember that
[00:20:06.200 --> 00:20:11.240]   the idea of the armor of God is introduced with this commandment.
[00:20:11.240 --> 00:20:15.960]   Be strong in the Lord in the strength of His might.
[00:20:15.960 --> 00:20:20.520]   So therefore put on the full armor of God, okay?
[00:20:20.520 --> 00:20:24.800]   And then the idea there is putting on the full armor of God, you will be able to stand
[00:20:24.800 --> 00:20:26.640]   firm, okay?
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:30.520]   So I want to ask you this question, is that what you're thinking?
[00:20:30.520 --> 00:20:35.720]   And here's another serious picture of this individual who is fully decked out from head
[00:20:35.720 --> 00:20:39.960]   to toe, okay?
[00:20:39.960 --> 00:20:45.520]   Because I want you to realize that the kind of imagery Apostle Paul is painting for us
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:50.280]   here is that the battle is so fierce and the powers that we're fighting are so fierce and
[00:20:50.280 --> 00:20:57.000]   what we're engaging, he has seen it, this battle, already laying many of his friends
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:58.000]   to waste.
[00:20:58.000 --> 00:21:02.960]   I mean, you look at the end of many of the letters and he accounts for how many people
[00:21:02.960 --> 00:21:08.000]   have deserted, how many people have left, how many people have fallen to temptation.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:12.360]   And sometimes he'll say, you know, all those in Asia completely deserted me.
[00:21:12.360 --> 00:21:14.880]   He's got a few that's left.
[00:21:14.880 --> 00:21:20.680]   And I wonder, is it because they completely undermined what kind of battle we're in?
[00:21:20.680 --> 00:21:23.840]   And again, no one wants to look like this walking around.
[00:21:23.840 --> 00:21:29.240]   How cumbersome, how uncomfortable, how hot and sweaty, right?
[00:21:29.240 --> 00:21:37.800]   And so sometimes you think, perhaps I can just do with just the breastplate, but I don't
[00:21:37.800 --> 00:21:39.160]   want to look like a fool.
[00:21:39.160 --> 00:21:41.280]   I don't want to have all this stuff.
[00:21:41.280 --> 00:21:46.360]   But that challenge again is we must do it all, take on the full armor of God.
[00:21:46.360 --> 00:21:47.520]   Next section of the scripture.
[00:21:47.520 --> 00:21:52.640]   So as you look at our section for today, we have verse 16 through 17, which is one section
[00:21:52.640 --> 00:21:54.120]   on the armor of God.
[00:21:54.120 --> 00:21:58.960]   And then it says with, and so there's a connection there, verse 18 through 20, clearly speaking
[00:21:58.960 --> 00:22:02.080]   about our prayer fighting.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:04.320]   I like this picture a lot.
[00:22:04.320 --> 00:22:08.840]   Young lady praying in front of her Bible, but the image in the mirror, she's got all
[00:22:08.840 --> 00:22:10.920]   the pieces of her armor.
[00:22:10.920 --> 00:22:11.920]   Let's take a look at that passage.
[00:22:11.920 --> 00:22:16.440]   It says with all prayer and petition, pray at all times in the spirit.
[00:22:16.440 --> 00:22:20.840]   And with this in view, be on the other with all perseverance and petition for all the
[00:22:20.840 --> 00:22:26.880]   saints and pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth
[00:22:26.880 --> 00:22:31.480]   to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel for with I am an ambassador in
[00:22:31.480 --> 00:22:37.800]   change that in proclaiming it, I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
[00:22:37.800 --> 00:22:44.640]   So within this passage, very clearly he says with this prayer, be praying.
[00:22:44.640 --> 00:22:49.280]   And what's really incredible as you observe the passage, remember, we're looking for emphasis
[00:22:49.280 --> 00:22:53.960]   when we study, we're looking for repetition, we're looking for ideas that are given in
[00:22:53.960 --> 00:23:00.680]   multiple angles, and here it's like pray, pray, pray, pray, pray, and pray, pray, pray.
[00:23:00.680 --> 00:23:02.800]   That's how this passage reads to us.
[00:23:02.800 --> 00:23:09.080]   Notice how it says with all kinds of prayer, with all prayer and petitions.
[00:23:09.080 --> 00:23:14.960]   So with petitions, clearly it's like the request, prayers, this is with all of it.
[00:23:14.960 --> 00:23:19.400]   What's more in terms of time, very clearly it says that you should be praying at all
[00:23:19.400 --> 00:23:20.400]   times.
[00:23:20.400 --> 00:23:24.520]   And what's very interesting is although the passage reads like a command, with prayer
[00:23:24.520 --> 00:23:26.400]   and petition, pray, right?
[00:23:26.400 --> 00:23:31.920]   That word pray is in the active participle, which means it's a praying.
[00:23:31.920 --> 00:23:34.440]   So it's like all prayer, petitions, praying.
[00:23:34.440 --> 00:23:38.000]   And remember he was saying that you need to be doing it all.
[00:23:38.000 --> 00:23:44.360]   Having done all to stand, and this then includes it, in your standing firm and in your strength,
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:51.560]   you have to be praying at all times, with all kinds of prayers and all kinds of petitions.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.680]   Notice also that he talks about your prayers should be in the spirit of God.
[00:23:56.680 --> 00:24:01.840]   Your prayers are not mantras, your prayers are not just simply repetition of words as
[00:24:01.840 --> 00:24:08.280]   though once you hit the full tank of 50 prayers or 100 prayers, and all of a sudden it's like
[00:24:08.280 --> 00:24:09.880]   whoop, that guy just leveled up.
[00:24:09.880 --> 00:24:13.000]   Like that is not the way God is responding to us.
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:17.840]   Our prayers need to be sincere, our prayers need to be faithful, our prayers need to be
[00:24:17.840 --> 00:24:21.160]   trusting in the presence of God.
[00:24:21.160 --> 00:24:26.560]   And in that way our prayers are incredibly powerful because God has said, "This is the
[00:24:26.560 --> 00:24:28.400]   way to fight."
[00:24:28.400 --> 00:24:31.680]   What's more, he says, "With alertness, with perseverance."
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:33.520]   He says this, "With all this imbued."
[00:24:33.520 --> 00:24:38.280]   So understanding and seeing with spiritual eyes what is the current context beyond what
[00:24:38.280 --> 00:24:40.880]   you can see with the physical eyeball.
[00:24:40.880 --> 00:24:44.600]   You're noticing that there are dog forces, you're noticing there are movements, you're
[00:24:44.600 --> 00:24:49.880]   noticing that there are ideologies, you're noticing that there are trends, you're noticing
[00:24:49.880 --> 00:24:54.520]   there are slaves, you're noticing there's flesh, like your own flesh having its passions
[00:24:54.520 --> 00:24:59.040]   and lusts, you're noticing there's people, all this kind of stuff around you.
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:05.120]   Being aware of all that, you need to be praying with alertness and perseverance.
[00:25:05.120 --> 00:25:10.840]   To think that because you prayed in the morning, that you don't need to be praying tomorrow,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:13.960]   that's ultimately kind of pharisaical.
[00:25:13.960 --> 00:25:19.400]   If you think that you did something in the morning and therefore the rest of the time
[00:25:19.400 --> 00:25:26.520]   is all you, then you're kind of baking your trust on, "I got that done in the morning."
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:30.920]   We have to be thinking, "No, no, no, there's a perseverance of prayer that is in the spirit
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:35.240]   at all times in all kinds of prayers and petitions."
[00:25:35.240 --> 00:25:44.640]   So, man, when you think about prayer, prayer really is the way by which once, not simply
[00:25:44.640 --> 00:25:50.040]   once, but as we are armed, so to speak, that's the fight.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:52.240]   Prayer is the engagement in the battle.
[00:25:52.240 --> 00:25:56.360]   Because you can put on the armor and then go hide in the bunker.
[00:25:56.360 --> 00:26:02.720]   You can put on armor and go hide behind all the rest of your friends.
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:07.560]   There are those individuals who just simply talk a lot about, "Yeah, you know, I observed
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:08.560]   this stuff happens."
[00:26:08.560 --> 00:26:11.480]   But they're not engaged in the fight.
[00:26:11.480 --> 00:26:17.160]   They kind of just want to know, "What does that soldier think?
[00:26:17.160 --> 00:26:18.160]   What does that soldier think?"
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:20.240]   I think that's so common in our day.
[00:26:20.240 --> 00:26:24.960]   As I observed, people love reading blogs, which is totally fine.
[00:26:24.960 --> 00:26:31.280]   People love asking for the opinions of popular Christian leaders, which is again also fine.
[00:26:31.280 --> 00:26:37.120]   But sometimes I wonder, "But once you do that, it kind of begs the question.
[00:26:37.120 --> 00:26:40.120]   And you, what are your convictions?
[00:26:40.120 --> 00:26:42.640]   And you, what are you going to fight for?
[00:26:42.640 --> 00:26:43.640]   What are you standing for?"
[00:26:43.640 --> 00:26:48.080]   But then, nevertheless, there's a lot of people who are just like, "Oh, yeah, I just read
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.080]   up on a lot of it."
[00:26:49.080 --> 00:26:55.600]   There's this thought in my head, "You can sit there and try to garner all the different
[00:26:55.600 --> 00:26:59.600]   opinions, but in the end, you don't have any stake in the game.
[00:26:59.600 --> 00:27:01.800]   You don't have any stake in the fight."
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:07.960]   But prayer, that is you investing in the fight.
[00:27:07.960 --> 00:27:13.640]   You being on your knees, you lifting up your petitions, you praying for strength, that's
[00:27:13.640 --> 00:27:15.960]   you engaging in the fight.
[00:27:15.960 --> 00:27:18.960]   And so therefore, prayer is the strategy.
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:23.320]   Again, prayer is the best strategy.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.160]   Prayer is the most powerful means.
[00:27:26.160 --> 00:27:30.280]   And we have to be thinking, "If I do not pray, I lose.
[00:27:30.280 --> 00:27:33.600]   Today, if I have not prayed, I lost.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:37.040]   Today, if I have not prayed, I've completely lost ground.
[00:27:37.040 --> 00:27:38.040]   I've become weaker.
[00:27:38.040 --> 00:27:43.960]   And perhaps they can have already put a foothold where you shouldn't be praying anything."
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:45.920]   That's the way we need to be thinking.
[00:27:45.920 --> 00:27:49.840]   And truthfully, I think the vast majority of us has experienced it.
[00:27:49.840 --> 00:27:51.600]   Because we know temptation about us.
[00:27:51.600 --> 00:27:56.240]   I mean, I've confessed to you that because I'm a pastor, I'm not susceptible to temptation
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.720]   of wanting the world.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:05.480]   Because I'm a pastor, am I all of a sudden now just completely immune to greed?
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.320]   Do I never get tempted with wanting more?
[00:28:08.320 --> 00:28:09.720]   More possessions?
[00:28:09.720 --> 00:28:11.320]   More time?
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:12.320]   More money?
[00:28:12.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   More houses?
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:14.320]   More whatever?
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:16.720]   All those are temptations.
[00:28:16.720 --> 00:28:19.520]   Am I immune to lust?
[00:28:19.520 --> 00:28:21.760]   Am I immune to fearness?
[00:28:21.760 --> 00:28:24.480]   Am I immune to hatred?
[00:28:24.480 --> 00:28:29.920]   You know very well, every single one of us, we are susceptible and we have weakness.
[00:28:29.920 --> 00:28:32.240]   We're beset with weakness.
[00:28:32.240 --> 00:28:39.160]   And I have found, and we have years of experience to tell us, when we do not pray, we're absolutely
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:40.160]   weak.
[00:28:40.160 --> 00:28:42.760]   Desperately weak.
[00:28:42.760 --> 00:28:46.040]   And so, remember that prayer is absolutely powerful.
[00:28:46.040 --> 00:28:47.040]   And it is a fight.
[00:28:47.040 --> 00:28:49.920]   And this passage really is sobering.
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:56.800]   The Lord, Jesus Christ, said to Peter, Simon, Simon, "Behold, Satan has desired to haunt
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:29:01.280]   you, that he may sift you like wheat."
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.360]   There is a spiritual battle you do not understand.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:09.960]   Satan has his crosshairs on you and he is going to attack you.
[00:29:09.960 --> 00:29:11.640]   But look what Jesus said.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:14.080]   I have prayed for you.
[00:29:14.080 --> 00:29:15.080]   What?
[00:29:15.080 --> 00:29:19.680]   That your faith may, that your faith shall fail not.
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:23.640]   And when you are converted, strengthen your brothers.
[00:29:23.640 --> 00:29:24.640]   Think about that.
[00:29:24.640 --> 00:29:33.640]   Christ the Lord, telling Peter, there is a spiritual reality and Satan has his sights
[00:29:33.640 --> 00:29:38.960]   on you and you suspect because Christ is so powerful, maybe Christ should have rebuked
[00:29:38.960 --> 00:29:41.960]   Satan and been like, "Oh, Jesus Christ!"
[00:29:41.960 --> 00:29:44.320]   Rather like, he could have.
[00:29:44.320 --> 00:29:46.760]   But Jesus says, I have prayed for you.
[00:29:46.760 --> 00:29:48.520]   The power of God.
[00:29:48.520 --> 00:29:51.560]   And so, remember the scripture in the passage that we are reading says, "Our struggle is
[00:29:51.560 --> 00:29:52.560]   not flesh and blood."
[00:29:52.560 --> 00:29:57.360]   It is against the rulers, against the powers, against the world forces of this darkness,
[00:29:57.360 --> 00:30:00.600]   against the spiritual forces of wickedness.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:02.680]   So we have to pray.
[00:30:02.680 --> 00:30:06.080]   We absolutely have to pray.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:08.080]   Next.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.960]   In the latter half of that section, it says, "Pray on my behalf, that utterance may be
[00:30:11.960 --> 00:30:14.160]   given to me in the opening of my mouth."
[00:30:14.160 --> 00:30:19.800]   And notice my highlighting in blue, that Apostle Paul has one currently.
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:26.080]   It's not so much that there is only one thing that you can pray for, but clearly here as
[00:30:26.080 --> 00:30:32.720]   he's talking about your prayers, there is the topic of prayer that must be at the forefront
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:37.560]   of the battle, which is that, "Utterance may be given to me in the opening of my mouth,
[00:30:37.560 --> 00:30:42.160]   to make known with boldness the mystery of the gospel, for which I am an ambassador in
[00:30:42.160 --> 00:30:46.320]   chains, that in proclaiming it I may speak boldly as I ought to speak."
[00:30:46.320 --> 00:30:51.920]   And so the observation there is, Apostle Paul is focused on what we should pray for, is
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:31:00.760]   the proclamation of the truth, and the boldness, the courage to proclaim that gospel.
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:07.320]   And as we think about it, we think about, again, the battle and the fight, we think
[00:31:07.320 --> 00:31:14.560]   about how to win, we think about what we can do to engage, and we realize the proclamation
[00:31:14.560 --> 00:31:18.800]   of the gospel is the shining of light.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:26.160]   In the dark, dark world, the power of the gospel of Christ is, is the glorious light.
[00:31:26.160 --> 00:31:31.520]   And as I think about this and conclude, I want to point to an interesting passage.
[00:31:31.520 --> 00:31:38.560]   In Romans chapter 10, verses 1-4, Apostle Paul describes his heart behind the agenda,
[00:31:38.560 --> 00:31:44.720]   so to speak, the prayer topic, the heart motive, like that kind of thing.
[00:31:44.720 --> 00:31:48.960]   And what he says in Romans chapter 10 is, "Brethren, my heart desire and my prayer to
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:54.160]   God, prayer to God, is for them, is their salvation.
[00:31:54.160 --> 00:32:00.200]   For I testify about them that they have a zeal for God, but not in accordance with knowledge.
[00:32:00.200 --> 00:32:04.600]   For not knowing about God's righteousness and seeking to establish their own, they did
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.520]   not subject themselves to the righteousness of God.
[00:32:07.520 --> 00:32:14.480]   For Christ is the end of the law, for righteousness to everyone who believes."
[00:32:14.480 --> 00:32:19.440]   And what you kind of garner from that is, clearly, Apostle Paul's heart reached for
[00:32:19.440 --> 00:32:23.560]   his people, that ultimately they would be saved in Christ.
[00:32:23.560 --> 00:32:28.280]   But what he desires for them is that right now, they have this desire and zeal, like,
[00:32:28.280 --> 00:32:30.800]   "Yeah, God exists, and yes, God is holy."
[00:32:30.800 --> 00:32:36.200]   But they don't even know how to obtain the righteousness you need to go to God.
[00:32:36.200 --> 00:32:38.400]   And so this idea is, how does someone get righteous?
[00:32:38.400 --> 00:32:41.680]   And Apostle Paul's saying, "It's the gospel in Christ.
[00:32:41.680 --> 00:32:45.920]   Only through Christ and the salvation that's given can you obtain righteousness."
[00:32:45.920 --> 00:32:51.240]   But what that means then, is that only through the gospel, only through the preaching of
[00:32:51.240 --> 00:32:55.320]   Christ, can one then be freed from the law.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:57.120]   End of the burden.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.400]   End of all the sin and wretchedness.
[00:32:59.400 --> 00:33:01.080]   End of all the bluff.
[00:33:01.080 --> 00:33:03.160]   End of all the guilt and shame.
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:04.160]   Right?
[00:33:04.160 --> 00:33:06.160]   What am I talking about?
[00:33:06.160 --> 00:33:14.120]   There is an incredible burden and battle where darkness has covered the eyes of His people.
[00:33:14.120 --> 00:33:17.880]   Where guilt and shame is heavily still burdening His people.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.920]   And the law is standing there accusing His people.
[00:33:21.920 --> 00:33:29.400]   Apostle Paul appropriately recognizes that in this spiritual battle, there is only truly
[00:33:29.400 --> 00:33:34.520]   one thing that is the agenda and mission that he must devote himself to.
[00:33:34.520 --> 00:33:38.040]   And it's the preaching of the gospel.
[00:33:38.040 --> 00:33:40.440]   Christ is everything.
[00:33:40.440 --> 00:33:42.480]   Christ is victory.
[00:33:42.480 --> 00:33:45.000]   Christ is entrance into sainthood.
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.840]   Christ is my righteousness.
[00:33:46.840 --> 00:33:48.440]   Christ is my life.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:50.440]   Christ is everything.
[00:33:50.440 --> 00:33:54.880]   And so he says, pray your heart out.
[00:33:54.880 --> 00:34:03.680]   With perseverance, with endurance and constant, non-stop, dedicated commitment.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:05.240]   Pray.
[00:34:05.240 --> 00:34:07.680]   Pray that people will be saved.
[00:34:07.680 --> 00:34:10.480]   Pray that people will come to Christ.
[00:34:10.480 --> 00:34:18.440]   So as I think about that, to me, that gives absolute clarity of how to be strong, doesn't
[00:34:18.440 --> 00:34:19.440]   it?
[00:34:19.440 --> 00:34:22.840]   You don't have to be strong in some kind of man-made machismo way.
[00:34:22.840 --> 00:34:26.640]   You don't have to be strong in some kind of like artificial fashion.
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:28.880]   Like strong just simply at your work.
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:33.560]   Or strong to make sure that you have a certain personality.
[00:34:33.560 --> 00:34:39.120]   The agenda and objective of what it means to be strong, how and for what is clear to
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:40.680]   us as believers.
[00:34:40.680 --> 00:34:43.240]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:48.400]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:34:48.400 --> 00:34:50.760]   Thank you for your teaching and admonishment.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:58.720]   And we pray that God, our hearts will be so engrossed in you, Lord.
[00:34:58.720 --> 00:35:00.840]   So saturated in you.
[00:35:00.840 --> 00:35:03.920]   So that God ultimately, God will be to our blessing.
[00:35:03.920 --> 00:35:08.120]   Because that is for us our security.
[00:35:08.120 --> 00:35:09.680]   It's our strength.
[00:35:09.680 --> 00:35:11.720]   It's everything, Lord.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:16.520]   So I pray, Father God, that especially now in very unsettling times, would you grant
[00:35:16.520 --> 00:35:20.600]   to us a prayerful heart, pattern of life.
[00:35:20.600 --> 00:35:22.840]   Would you grant to us clarity of focus.
[00:35:22.840 --> 00:35:24.840]   What are we doing here?
[00:35:24.840 --> 00:35:26.280]   Preaching the gospel.
[00:35:26.280 --> 00:35:31.200]   Exalting and proclaiming Christ who is the light to all mankind.
[00:35:31.200 --> 00:35:34.960]   And I pray, Father Lord, that to that end, we'd be ready.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.280]   We'd be prepared.
[00:35:36.280 --> 00:35:37.760]   And God, that would be our business.
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:40.240]   Lord, we thank you so much in Christ's name we pray.
[00:35:40.240 --> 00:35:40.740]   Amen.
[00:35:40.740 --> 00:35:43.240]   (music fades)
