[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.360]   Alright, well we'll get started you guys.
[00:00:12.360 --> 00:00:20.520]   We're actually studying today in depth until verse 22.
[00:00:20.520 --> 00:00:27.400]   I had notes up until 31 but it's just kind of too much to cover at one time.
[00:00:27.400 --> 00:00:34.320]   So I want to, there's a bunch of announcements happening but a couple ones I want to highlight
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:41.520]   is that this coming Saturday we have the Sisters Fellowship and then the weekend after is our
[00:00:41.520 --> 00:00:42.940]   membership meeting.
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:46.320]   So if you guys know that you can't make it to the membership meeting, please make sure
[00:00:46.320 --> 00:00:48.720]   to email us.
[00:00:48.720 --> 00:00:53.760]   Also that week happens to be communion and I want to just mention today's passage has
[00:00:53.760 --> 00:00:55.640]   a little bit to do with communion.
[00:00:55.640 --> 00:01:01.240]   It's important time for the entire church to just kind of reflect, to focus, to remember
[00:01:01.240 --> 00:01:05.640]   more than anything and then to celebrate God's return, Christ's return.
[00:01:05.640 --> 00:01:08.400]   So please take time to prepare for that.
[00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:14.240]   Also again in the month of October we have lots of stuff, bigger events happening.
[00:01:14.240 --> 00:01:18.680]   Sports day is happening, we have couples retreat and then we have Reformation Night.
[00:01:18.680 --> 00:01:22.240]   If you guys want to volunteer for any of this stuff, please make sure just to email me and
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:24.360]   I'll direct you in the right way.
[00:01:24.360 --> 00:01:25.360]   Okay?
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:26.360]   Cool.
[00:01:26.360 --> 00:01:39.480]   Alright, well that being said, let's open up our Bibles to 1 Corinthians 10.
[00:01:39.480 --> 00:01:45.440]   And we've already been in the book of 1 Corinthians for some time and again I've loved it because
[00:01:45.440 --> 00:01:49.680]   there's a sense in which by hitting some of the major things that the church struggles
[00:01:49.680 --> 00:01:55.480]   with, Paul is calling for maturity.
[00:01:55.480 --> 00:02:01.080]   Can you believe we're already into week 19 of studying 1 Corinthians?
[00:02:01.080 --> 00:02:04.080]   Let's take a look starting from verse 14, I'm just going to read it since the paragraph
[00:02:04.080 --> 00:02:07.280]   begins there and then go to verse 22.
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:11.960]   And it says, "Therefore my beloved, flee from idolatry.
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:15.440]   I speak as to wise men, you judge what I say.
[00:02:15.440 --> 00:02:21.280]   Is not the cup of blessing which we bless a sharing in the blood of Christ?
[00:02:21.280 --> 00:02:26.160]   Is not the bread which we break a sharing in the body of Christ?
[00:02:26.160 --> 00:02:29.580]   Since there is one bread, we who are many are one body.
[00:02:29.580 --> 00:02:32.000]   For we all partake of the one bread.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:33.880]   Look at the nation Israel.
[00:02:33.880 --> 00:02:38.080]   Are not those who eat the sacrifices a share in the altar?
[00:02:38.080 --> 00:02:39.080]   What do I mean then?
[00:02:39.080 --> 00:02:42.240]   That a thing sacrificed to idols is anything?
[00:02:42.240 --> 00:02:44.040]   Or that an idol is anything?
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:45.240]   No.
[00:02:45.240 --> 00:02:49.520]   But I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to demons and not
[00:02:49.520 --> 00:02:50.640]   to God.
[00:02:50.640 --> 00:02:55.760]   And I want you to become, I do not want you to become sharers in demons.
[00:02:55.760 --> 00:02:59.200]   You cannot drink the cup of the Lord and the cup of demons.
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:02.840]   You cannot partake of the table of the Lord and the table of demons.
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:05.760]   Or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:08.320]   We are not stronger than he, are we?
[00:03:08.320 --> 00:03:13.680]   All right, let's take a moment to pray that God will bless the study of his word.
[00:03:13.680 --> 00:03:16.400]   Father God, we do pray.
[00:03:16.400 --> 00:03:22.240]   Lord, each time we open up, we pray that there would be a spiritual work done.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:27.800]   God, I pray that this, it would not simply be an accumulation of knowledge, but God,
[00:03:27.800 --> 00:03:33.200]   that there would be true fruit of the spirit, which leads to conviction of righteousness,
[00:03:33.200 --> 00:03:38.440]   of holiness, of sin, which leads to greater love and dedication to you.
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:43.000]   And I pray God that again, your spirit would go before us tonight as we study.
[00:03:43.000 --> 00:03:45.040]   And I pray God that our hearts would be attentive.
[00:03:45.040 --> 00:03:48.760]   It's in Christ name we pray, amen.
[00:03:48.760 --> 00:03:55.360]   Okay, well, jumping straight into the lesson for today, we take a look at verse 14 through
[00:03:55.360 --> 00:03:57.640]   15.
[00:03:57.640 --> 00:04:06.640]   And I want to ask you guys, in taking a look at that, what do you see as Apostle Paul's
[00:04:06.640 --> 00:04:09.640]   expectation?
[00:04:09.640 --> 00:04:18.960]   Expectation or shins?
[00:04:18.960 --> 00:04:20.760]   That the listeners be wise?
[00:04:20.760 --> 00:04:23.000]   Okay, good.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:30.840]   So Apostle Paul expects that the people he is talking to, that they be wise enough.
[00:04:30.840 --> 00:04:31.840]   Okay?
[00:04:31.840 --> 00:04:37.640]   And it's been quite interesting because he's been frustrated with their wisdom and discernment.
[00:04:37.640 --> 00:04:41.200]   And he says, I expect you to be discerning enough.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   Okay?
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:45.760]   Any other expectation that you see?
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:55.240]   Okay, to follow his argument and his train of reasoning, it kind of comes out as like,
[00:04:55.240 --> 00:04:59.560]   so I'm speaking to you in this way, you need to judge what I'm saying.
[00:04:59.560 --> 00:05:03.040]   Like follow what I'm saying, like get it, you know?
[00:05:03.040 --> 00:05:05.400]   And I find that quite interesting as he's talking to them.
[00:05:05.400 --> 00:05:13.440]   And let me take a moment to think about that with you guys for a moment is, you know, he's
[00:05:13.440 --> 00:05:19.080]   making an argument now, but realize that his argument has been building since the beginning
[00:05:19.080 --> 00:05:21.360]   of the letter, right?
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:25.280]   His argument has been building from the beginning of the letter where he began saying, look,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:30.800]   you guys are believers and I thank God for you, every single one of you.
[00:05:30.800 --> 00:05:37.360]   And I, and he essentially has a warm fatherly attitude towards everybody in the church.
[00:05:37.360 --> 00:05:41.440]   But then as he's writing to them, he starts building this argument about how they need
[00:05:41.440 --> 00:05:46.600]   to be humble, how they need to be united and essentially mature in every single way you
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:50.380]   can think of and purity and everything, you know?
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:55.840]   But he comes back to this point as he's talking to them is, I want you to be wise enough and
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:05:58.680]   I expect you to be discerning enough.
[00:05:58.680 --> 00:06:02.360]   If you are Christian, you need to get what I'm saying.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:10.120]   And earlier I mentioned that I love this book because it really is a call to maturity.
[00:06:10.120 --> 00:06:17.400]   I find that perhaps there is a frustration in him saying like, you guys don't get it,
[00:06:17.400 --> 00:06:19.960]   but I expect you to get it.
[00:06:19.960 --> 00:06:25.800]   But perhaps it's because there is this gap here where the people are still arguing on
[00:06:25.800 --> 00:06:29.200]   the level of like what's right and wrong, right?
[00:06:29.200 --> 00:06:34.560]   But Apostle Paul is arguing on the level of be discerning and wise.
[00:06:34.560 --> 00:06:35.760]   Okay?
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:41.680]   So you can imagine when there's somebody who is a Christian and he's learning, and he's
[00:06:41.680 --> 00:06:47.160]   learning principles and truth, he could be pointing at a very specific passage and saying,
[00:06:47.160 --> 00:06:48.800]   look it, that's what it says.
[00:06:48.800 --> 00:06:49.800]   This is the truth.
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.040]   Look here.
[00:06:51.040 --> 00:06:55.600]   But the whole time Apostle Paul is saying, look here.
[00:06:55.600 --> 00:07:00.800]   I see your argument, but look here, I'm pointing towards greater maturity.
[00:07:00.800 --> 00:07:02.240]   He expects them to be wise.
[00:07:02.240 --> 00:07:06.920]   He expects them to exercise their judgment and discernment as to what he is saying.
[00:07:06.920 --> 00:07:07.920]   Okay?
[00:07:07.920 --> 00:07:13.920]   And today as I was studying this passage, I want you to think about that.
[00:07:13.920 --> 00:07:19.580]   There is a difference between just deciding what's right, acceptable, okay?
[00:07:19.580 --> 00:07:23.280]   As opposed to what's wise, which mature.
[00:07:23.280 --> 00:07:24.280]   Okay?
[00:07:24.280 --> 00:07:26.040]   All right.
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:30.080]   But what's the other expectation in the form of a clear command?
[00:07:30.080 --> 00:07:36.600]   You're expected to recognize and flee from idolatry.
[00:07:36.600 --> 00:07:37.600]   Excellent.
[00:07:37.600 --> 00:07:39.560]   I like how he put it.
[00:07:39.560 --> 00:07:43.760]   Both recognize and flee from the idols.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:44.760]   Okay?
[00:07:44.760 --> 00:07:48.520]   I remember I used to say something to the extent of like, in the Bible, you know, the
[00:07:48.520 --> 00:07:51.880]   only sin that God tells us flee is sexual immorality.
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:55.480]   And I was studying this passage, I was like, God, I wonder why I said that.
[00:07:55.480 --> 00:07:58.840]   Because here it says flee from idolatry.
[00:07:58.840 --> 00:08:01.880]   So there's multiple places where he says flee.
[00:08:01.880 --> 00:08:05.000]   And I want you guys to just think about that for a moment.
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.040]   Because to flee, obviously, is quite an intense word.
[00:08:09.040 --> 00:08:10.040]   You know?
[00:08:10.040 --> 00:08:14.440]   You think about various things he wants you to overcome, be victorious, be overcomers,
[00:08:14.440 --> 00:08:15.440]   you know?
[00:08:15.440 --> 00:08:17.120]   And then it's like, flee!
[00:08:17.120 --> 00:08:18.120]   Just run!
[00:08:18.120 --> 00:08:25.000]   And you've got to ask the question, like, how severe and how perhaps, again, how severe
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.400]   he sees this problem and the ramifications of it, right?
[00:08:29.400 --> 00:08:36.360]   So these are his expectations for us, the clear command for us to flee what is idolatry.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.040]   What's really interesting to me is it's so emphatic that he just places it at the front
[00:08:41.040 --> 00:08:44.400]   and then he's going to give us reasons why.
[00:08:44.400 --> 00:08:47.920]   I asked you guys to outline the passage.
[00:08:47.920 --> 00:08:54.000]   The outlining of the passage to me really is this command, flee, is at the top.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:55.200]   Boom.
[00:08:55.200 --> 00:09:01.720]   And then the various sections that come after, including sections like 16, or verse 16 through
[00:09:01.720 --> 00:09:08.680]   18, verse 19 to 21, verse 22, and then even further on, verse 22 down to whatever, these
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:11.320]   are reasons why you need to flee.
[00:09:11.320 --> 00:09:12.840]   Okay?
[00:09:12.840 --> 00:09:16.760]   He's giving us the reason, he's giving us the points.
[00:09:16.760 --> 00:09:21.200]   Here's premise one, premise two, premise three, therefore flee is one way to do it.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.480]   The other way to do it is run!
[00:09:23.480 --> 00:09:24.480]   And then tell you why.
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:25.480]   Okay?
[00:09:25.480 --> 00:09:31.000]   And so you've got to ask the question, in Apostle Paul's mind, how severe does he see
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   the sin of idolatry?
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Okay?
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.120]   Well, let's move forward then.
[00:09:36.120 --> 00:09:42.240]   What's one of the first reasons why Apostle Paul gives as to why we need to flee idolatry?
[00:09:42.240 --> 00:09:46.480]   Can I have, whose back of the head am I looking at there?
[00:09:46.480 --> 00:09:47.880]   Is that Randall?
[00:09:47.880 --> 00:09:48.880]   Can you read nicely for us, verse 16 through 18?
[00:09:48.880 --> 00:09:49.880]   It's not the color of the sea which is the best insurance for the human race.
[00:09:49.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   It's not the birth history that we should regret sharing with all of the rest.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:51.880]   Since there is no birth, we need to learn about it.
[00:09:51.880 --> 00:09:52.880]   So we don't have to take that risk.
[00:09:52.880 --> 00:09:53.880]   But, look at the issue here.
[00:09:53.880 --> 00:10:20.040]   A lot of girls who leave us are sick.
[00:10:20.040 --> 00:10:21.040]   The second question is, seriously, what's the answer?
[00:10:21.040 --> 00:10:22.040]   Okay, thank you.
[00:10:22.040 --> 00:10:24.320]   So, I'm going to ask you for a huge favor.
[00:10:24.320 --> 00:10:26.320]   Would you mind closing the doors in the back for us?
[00:10:26.320 --> 00:10:28.360]   I can hear the airplanes and stuff.
[00:10:28.360 --> 00:10:32.280]   I opened it all up because when I got in here, it was all like warm and, you know, in the
[00:10:32.280 --> 00:10:33.280]   room.
[00:10:33.280 --> 00:10:34.280]   Thank you.
[00:10:34.280 --> 00:10:35.280]   All right.
[00:10:35.280 --> 00:10:40.280]   So as you take a look at that passage, let's first do a quick observation.
[00:10:40.280 --> 00:10:43.360]   So just throw it out to me, you guys, what you see, and then we're going to do a what's
[00:10:43.360 --> 00:10:44.360]   the point.
[00:10:44.360 --> 00:10:45.360]   Okay?
[00:10:45.360 --> 00:10:50.280]   So first question is, can you just list the different references that he's pointing out
[00:10:50.280 --> 00:10:51.280]   here?
[00:10:51.280 --> 00:10:57.160]   Or the things that he's pointing to to make his argument.
[00:10:57.160 --> 00:11:09.120]   He lists the cup of blessing, and then he lists the bread, and then the?
[00:11:09.120 --> 00:11:11.400]   Okay.
[00:11:11.400 --> 00:11:17.400]   Actually, in order to help you put the list together, let's put them, like put the things
[00:11:17.400 --> 00:11:18.400]   together.
[00:11:18.400 --> 00:11:23.800]   So the cup of blessing, and then the blood, bread, and then the body.
[00:11:23.800 --> 00:11:33.640]   And then there's the, someone said it here, sacrifices that attaches to the altar.
[00:11:33.640 --> 00:11:35.480]   Okay, great.
[00:11:35.480 --> 00:11:38.000]   So what you see is he's got these reference points.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:39.000]   Okay?
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:41.680]   He's like, hey, don't we have this cup of blessing?
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:42.680]   Share in the blood of Christ.
[00:11:42.680 --> 00:11:43.680]   Don't we have this bread?
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:44.680]   Share in the body of Christ.
[00:11:44.680 --> 00:11:45.680]   Don't we have the sacrifices?
[00:11:45.680 --> 00:11:46.680]   Share in the altar.
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:47.680]   All right.
[00:11:47.680 --> 00:11:52.160]   So, okay, you've just listed three various things.
[00:11:52.160 --> 00:11:53.160]   What's the point?
[00:11:53.160 --> 00:11:56.160]   The sharing in Christ.
[00:11:56.160 --> 00:11:59.800]   Okay, good.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:07.280]   So with each element, what you have is a sharing of Christ.
[00:12:07.280 --> 00:12:10.760]   Well, the first two is very clear.
[00:12:10.760 --> 00:12:13.440]   We have the communion table.
[00:12:13.440 --> 00:12:19.360]   And those of you guys who recently went through BCC, or if you guys remember, in BCC class,
[00:12:19.360 --> 00:12:24.360]   I go down in week seven, this whole list of what the communion represents, right?
[00:12:24.360 --> 00:12:30.200]   And I go down the whole list of talking about how in the Old Testament, blood represented
[00:12:30.200 --> 00:12:37.160]   life.
[00:12:37.160 --> 00:12:39.520]   The blood represented life.
[00:12:39.520 --> 00:12:44.080]   And the thing about it is, in so taking part of that blood, you're saying, this is Christ's
[00:12:44.080 --> 00:12:45.080]   blood shed for me.
[00:12:45.080 --> 00:12:46.600]   That's his life shed for me.
[00:12:46.600 --> 00:12:50.440]   And so when you take part of that blood, the life of Christ, right?
[00:12:50.440 --> 00:12:53.320]   Likewise, the bread is the same thing, is the life of Christ.
[00:12:53.320 --> 00:12:55.920]   And then what's furthermore, the bread represents the body of Christ.
[00:12:55.920 --> 00:13:01.040]   You're literally taking part in Christ, in the person of Christ, right?
[00:13:01.040 --> 00:13:05.760]   And so when you do that act of communion, you're remembering everything that is of Christ.
[00:13:05.760 --> 00:13:10.640]   When you take that communion, it's like, you know, looking at a perfect picture.
[00:13:10.640 --> 00:13:14.120]   Sometimes you know, we look at certain photos on Facebook, you look at photos on your wall,
[00:13:14.120 --> 00:13:19.640]   and you sometimes sit there mesmerizing or reflecting, remembering whatever it is, right?
[00:13:19.640 --> 00:13:23.240]   It causes you to feel the emotions and all that kind of stuff.
[00:13:23.240 --> 00:13:24.920]   That's what communion is a picture of.
[00:13:24.920 --> 00:13:31.720]   It's just reminding you, Christ, who he is, what he's done, how he's coming back, all
[00:13:31.720 --> 00:13:34.540]   of that, right?
[00:13:34.540 --> 00:13:44.560]   But his point is that by doing the communion, which is the picture, you share in it.
[00:13:44.560 --> 00:13:50.800]   So if you guys would jot this down as a note, what's really interesting is the repeated
[00:13:50.800 --> 00:13:54.400]   term is that concept of sharing.
[00:13:54.400 --> 00:13:59.000]   Sharing in the blood of Christ, sharing in the body of Christ, partake of the one bread,
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:01.520]   share is in the altar.
[00:14:01.520 --> 00:14:03.720]   That's his point.
[00:14:03.720 --> 00:14:11.880]   And what's really interesting about that is the words for sharing is the word koinonia.
[00:14:11.880 --> 00:14:12.880]   It's the word koinonia.
[00:14:12.880 --> 00:14:14.360]   Jot that down as a note.
[00:14:14.360 --> 00:14:15.760]   And you guys have heard that term before.
[00:14:15.760 --> 00:14:21.160]   You know, it's like, come on guys, let's have real koinonia, you know?
[00:14:21.160 --> 00:14:23.720]   And what they're saying is like, let's have real fellowship.
[00:14:23.720 --> 00:14:27.200]   Let's really be one, united in the right thing.
[00:14:27.200 --> 00:14:32.080]   And other pastors of the Bible use koinonia to say you are a partaker, like a participant,
[00:14:32.080 --> 00:14:35.960]   two partners joined together to accomplish something.
[00:14:35.960 --> 00:14:37.800]   Okay?
[00:14:37.800 --> 00:14:44.640]   So Apostle Paul is making the point, look, when you do something, you are a share in
[00:14:44.640 --> 00:14:46.680]   what it represents.
[00:14:46.680 --> 00:14:48.320]   You're a part of that.
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:49.320]   That's your fellowship.
[00:14:49.320 --> 00:14:52.820]   That's you partaking of that.
[00:14:52.820 --> 00:14:55.480]   And so how does that connect with his argument?
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:58.920]   Well, he just said, flee from idolatry.
[00:14:58.920 --> 00:15:00.500]   Right?
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:05.960]   Because there's a sense in which then spiritually, if you allow yourself to haphazardly do the
[00:15:05.960 --> 00:15:10.240]   stuff that's associated with idolatry, what are you doing?
[00:15:10.240 --> 00:15:12.320]   You're joining yourself.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:13.800]   Right?
[00:15:13.800 --> 00:15:18.640]   And so let's think about kind of a summary to that point then.
[00:15:18.640 --> 00:15:20.360]   You know?
[00:15:20.360 --> 00:15:24.840]   To that segment in which Apostle Paul is pointing out to us, you need to flee from idolatry.
[00:15:24.840 --> 00:15:29.760]   But the first point Apostle Paul is making is because look, in everything you do, you
[00:15:29.760 --> 00:15:33.720]   are fellowshipping.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:46.200]   So my exhortation would be, pick the right fellowship.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:55.160]   If you were to think about, you know, an instance where you, you know, have one group versus
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:16:01.840]   another, one posse versus another, even in, you know, just this morning we were out on
[00:16:01.840 --> 00:16:07.640]   Ring Road and it was funny because we were passing out Berean flyers, but then I walked
[00:16:07.640 --> 00:16:13.280]   over to our table and we had all these different club flyers, you know, like double ACF flyers,
[00:16:13.280 --> 00:16:18.120]   CCM flyers, other campus ministry flyers on our Berean table.
[00:16:18.120 --> 00:16:23.560]   And what was hilarious was one of the students, as soon as they saw me, they were like, "Oh
[00:16:23.560 --> 00:16:24.560]   shoot!"
[00:16:24.560 --> 00:16:28.680]   And they just laughed, you know, because there's, you know, like in the mentality is like, "I'm
[00:16:28.680 --> 00:16:31.040]   supposed to be promoting Berean, what are you doing with that flyer?"
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:32.040]   You know?
[00:16:32.040 --> 00:16:35.480]   Well, amongst Christians, I say, "Hey, we're all believers and I'm okay with you passing
[00:16:35.480 --> 00:16:37.360]   out those other flyers."
[00:16:37.360 --> 00:16:41.000]   But I just use that as an example to say, imagine, I mean, if we were two competing
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.160]   fellowships, you would be like, "What the, why would you even promote that?"
[00:16:46.160 --> 00:16:47.160]   You know?
[00:16:47.160 --> 00:16:54.040]   In like vein, do we recognize that when whatever we're doing, there's a sense in which we are
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:57.280]   joining in fellowship with it.
[00:16:57.280 --> 00:17:01.800]   And when I said earlier, as an exhortation, "Pick the right fellowship," there's a sense
[00:17:01.800 --> 00:17:05.480]   in which not only do you need to pick the right fellowship, but you got to look like
[00:17:05.480 --> 00:17:06.480]   you belong.
[00:17:06.480 --> 00:17:11.040]   You can't straddle the fence of belonging to this club and that club, you can't have
[00:17:11.040 --> 00:17:13.920]   an identity crisis, "I want to be a part of this, I want to be a part of that."
[00:17:13.920 --> 00:17:19.480]   There's a sense in which, no, Apostle Paul expects a mature individual to fully belong
[00:17:19.480 --> 00:17:22.560]   to that fellowship.
[00:17:22.560 --> 00:17:27.960]   And you guys know where that's leading, because later on he's going to say very, very explicitly,
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:30.360]   you can't be a part of both.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:31.360]   Right?
[00:17:31.360 --> 00:17:32.360]   Okay.
[00:17:32.360 --> 00:17:38.600]   Moving forward then, to verses 19 through 21.
[00:17:38.600 --> 00:17:43.200]   Can I have, KJ, can you read that please?
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:52.880]   "What do I mean then?
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:18:03.880]   They think sacrifice idles a thing in things, but I idle a thing in things.
[00:18:03.880 --> 00:18:04.880]   Know that I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, is sacrifice of demons
[00:18:04.880 --> 00:18:05.880]   and not to God.
[00:18:05.880 --> 00:18:06.880]   And I do not want you to become sharers of demons.
[00:18:06.880 --> 00:18:07.880]   You cannot drink the cup of the Lord because of demons.
[00:18:07.880 --> 00:18:08.880]   Do not partake of this table, the Lord and the table of demons."
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:09.880]   Okay.
[00:18:09.880 --> 00:18:10.880]   So, there we have it.
[00:18:10.880 --> 00:18:14.120]   The exhortation that we were just anticipating.
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:19.320]   And in verse 19 to 21, he essentially kind of builds on the last point, look, we're partakers
[00:18:19.320 --> 00:18:22.440]   and sharers in it, so what do I mean?
[00:18:22.440 --> 00:18:27.720]   And then he starts to clarify that a thing sacrificed to idles is anything, or that an
[00:18:27.720 --> 00:18:29.760]   idol itself is anything.
[00:18:29.760 --> 00:18:35.840]   So picture again, please, the scenario that I brought up, starting from chapter eight.
[00:18:35.840 --> 00:18:38.840]   Back in that culture, idolatry was rampant.
[00:18:38.840 --> 00:18:43.680]   If you guys have ever visited certain other nations and other countries, especially places
[00:18:43.680 --> 00:18:50.920]   like let's say Thailand or India, where you have like a plethora of like idols everywhere,
[00:18:50.920 --> 00:18:55.560]   whether it be little Buddhas, whether it be little icons and all that kind of stuff.
[00:18:55.560 --> 00:19:00.280]   Just imagine that, you know, back then you'd have all these different figurines and no
[00:19:00.280 --> 00:19:04.840]   matter what kind of social environment you went to, there was always some kind of element
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:06.960]   of that idolatry in there.
[00:19:06.960 --> 00:19:11.640]   And even to this day, every time I go to like certain restaurants and I see like a big old
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:17.320]   Buddha in the front, it always makes me feel like, I don't know, I don't know, you know?
[00:19:17.320 --> 00:19:20.940]   But the thing about it is, I want you to just picture that kind of scenario.
[00:19:20.940 --> 00:19:27.040]   And remember that the scenario is, Apostle Paul initially said, look, we know that first
[00:19:27.040 --> 00:19:31.280]   there is the food that you're eating and you're wondering was that sacrifice to idols?
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:33.180]   And then there's the idol itself.
[00:19:33.180 --> 00:19:35.320]   We know that's nothing, okay?
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:36.320]   We know that's nothing.
[00:19:36.320 --> 00:19:40.400]   But here and now he's giving the exhortation, but do you need to flee?
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:41.400]   Okay?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:43.880]   So how do we reconcile that?
[00:19:43.880 --> 00:19:48.280]   Well, he repeats this idea again that a thing sacrificed to idols, is it anything?
[00:19:48.280 --> 00:19:50.600]   And he says, no, it's not.
[00:19:50.600 --> 00:19:56.000]   Well, I've got this little table for you and it's an easy question, but I just want you
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:19:58.840]   to like, I want to highlight a point here.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:02.000]   So I want you to just, you know, bear with me on this.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:06.640]   You've got on one side cup, bread, idol, and you got on the right side, blood, body, false
[00:20:06.640 --> 00:20:08.080]   God.
[00:20:08.080 --> 00:20:17.680]   What's the relationship from column A to column B?
[00:20:17.680 --> 00:20:18.680]   Thank you.
[00:20:18.680 --> 00:20:19.680]   Representation.
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:23.760]   It's representation.
[00:20:23.760 --> 00:20:30.320]   And I want you guys to just think about that for a moment and just kind of think through
[00:20:30.320 --> 00:20:33.800]   what that is, right?
[00:20:33.800 --> 00:20:37.920]   Behind the food and behind the idol, literally it's just a piece of wood.
[00:20:37.920 --> 00:20:43.360]   It's no holier, no special than let's say this pulpit made of wood, right?
[00:20:43.360 --> 00:20:46.920]   That's literal spiritual reality.
[00:20:46.920 --> 00:20:50.480]   But where it starts to really count is the representation.
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:54.760]   And so there's a sense in which even for us, what's weird is there's a dual element of
[00:20:54.760 --> 00:20:58.920]   when we do certain ordinances like baptism that we just had.
[00:20:58.920 --> 00:21:02.760]   So Peter typically says like, this doesn't really do anything.
[00:21:02.760 --> 00:21:06.080]   But then there would be a question then of like, then what's the point of doing it?
[00:21:06.080 --> 00:21:11.240]   Why would we have all our members think deeply about getting baptized and not only get baptized,
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:15.680]   but get baptized in the right mode, right?
[00:21:15.680 --> 00:21:19.000]   And the importance lies in what it represents.
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:20.080]   Okay?
[00:21:20.080 --> 00:21:25.000]   And this is the point to which I want to, I want to really like push and emphasize to
[00:21:25.000 --> 00:21:27.120]   you because it's so important.
[00:21:27.120 --> 00:21:31.880]   Remember earlier how I talked about how apostle Paul was frustrated because although the Corinthians
[00:21:31.880 --> 00:21:35.280]   church, they're Christians and some of them might've been Christians for some time, some
[00:21:35.280 --> 00:21:38.280]   of them are obviously newer believers.
[00:21:38.280 --> 00:21:42.560]   They're arguing with him like, look at this Bible verse, look at this truth.
[00:21:42.560 --> 00:21:44.960]   It's not wrong.
[00:21:44.960 --> 00:21:51.840]   But apostle Paul is saying, I see that, but I want you to look here to ask, is it mature?
[00:21:51.840 --> 00:21:59.520]   And this is one of the points to which that point of maturity really comes into the forefront.
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:05.040]   Because for us as Christians, we need to represent, right?
[00:22:05.040 --> 00:22:09.320]   In what we do, we need to reveal, manifest.
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.420]   We need to witness, we need to bear light.
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:15.320]   And so in doing that, there isn't a bare minimum.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:19.260]   There isn't a line, just do this, this and this, and now you're represented.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:21.200]   Do whatever you want with your freedom next.
[00:22:21.200 --> 00:22:26.440]   Apostle Paul, his mentality is we need to represent.
[00:22:26.440 --> 00:22:32.100]   So in all you do, whether you eat or drink, do all to the glory of God.
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:34.280]   So there isn't a line for apostle Paul.
[00:22:34.280 --> 00:22:35.280]   You see that?
[00:22:35.280 --> 00:22:38.160]   And so there's this, still sitting here, but look, it's not wrong.
[00:22:38.160 --> 00:22:41.760]   Apostle Paul is like, you're still looking at a point.
[00:22:41.760 --> 00:22:44.800]   Get your eyes off of that.
[00:22:44.800 --> 00:22:50.880]   Apostle Paul expects the church to mature way beyond that, to identify when you do what
[00:22:50.880 --> 00:22:55.680]   you do, what does it represent?
[00:22:55.680 --> 00:22:59.440]   That's an important question, right?
[00:22:59.440 --> 00:23:06.460]   And so that's why he might make the point, hey look, these idols really, really are nothing.
[00:23:06.460 --> 00:23:10.320]   But in maturity, you need to see beyond that.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:17.480]   So if in maturity you need to see beyond that, there is like rampant idolatry where literally
[00:23:17.480 --> 00:23:21.980]   you're bowing to a God and saying, you're my God.
[00:23:21.980 --> 00:23:23.480]   But this is where the question comes in.
[00:23:23.480 --> 00:23:26.920]   What other idolatrous things are there?
[00:23:26.920 --> 00:23:32.720]   What other forms, in the definition of idolatry, what other concepts have you seen in scripture?
[00:23:32.720 --> 00:23:38.440]   If you guys want to volunteer and just list some of those.
[00:23:38.440 --> 00:23:43.280]   What other things categorize as idolatry in the scriptures?
[00:23:43.280 --> 00:23:49.480]   Oh yeah, coveting.
[00:23:49.480 --> 00:23:59.680]   When you're coveting in your heart, what else?
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:00.680]   Relying on other things.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:01.680]   Relying on other things.
[00:24:01.680 --> 00:24:05.760]   And that idea, both those concepts encompass a lot of stuff, right?
[00:24:05.760 --> 00:24:10.040]   When you're coveting, you're like, you know, you have a desire and you have jealousy and
[00:24:10.040 --> 00:24:11.040]   stuff like that.
[00:24:11.040 --> 00:24:13.880]   Relying on other things, that's where your trust is, that's where your security is, you
[00:24:13.880 --> 00:24:14.880]   know?
[00:24:14.880 --> 00:24:15.880]   Good.
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:22.200]   When your reliance is on anything, when you're relying on something and that something takes
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:30.040]   greater trust, it receives greater confidence in the Lord God than you've committed idolatry.
[00:24:30.040 --> 00:24:31.040]   Anything else?
[00:24:31.040 --> 00:24:35.800]   Your pursuits.
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:42.400]   And typically it's like pursuit of success, pursuit of money.
[00:24:42.400 --> 00:24:48.560]   There was a passage that really kind of talked about idolatry and various things in the book
[00:24:48.560 --> 00:24:50.560]   of Job, interestingly enough.
[00:24:50.560 --> 00:24:55.800]   If you guys turn your Bible to Job 31.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:25:09.120]   Job 31, okay.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:14.400]   In Job 31, starting from verse 24, this is what it says.
[00:25:14.400 --> 00:25:23.120]   It says, "If I have put my confidence in gold and called fine gold my trust, if I have gloated
[00:25:23.120 --> 00:25:27.640]   because my wealth was great and because my hand had secured so much, if I have looked
[00:25:27.640 --> 00:25:33.860]   at the sun when it shone or the moon going in splendor and my heart became secretly enticed
[00:25:33.860 --> 00:25:40.640]   and my hand threw a kiss from my mouth, that too would have been an iniquity calling for
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:44.160]   judgment for I would have denied God above."
[00:25:44.160 --> 00:25:52.960]   Now that passage to me, you know, it encapsulates a lot of what is at the heart of idolatry.
[00:25:52.960 --> 00:26:00.080]   What is at the heart of idolatry is the replacement of God, right?
[00:26:00.080 --> 00:26:03.600]   At the heart of idolatry is a substitution.
[00:26:03.600 --> 00:26:09.640]   When God in the Ten Commandments talks about using his name in vain, having an image, having
[00:26:09.640 --> 00:26:15.640]   other gods, what is that but the replacement, the dethroning of God, right?
[00:26:15.640 --> 00:26:19.720]   But that is not the nature of what we do in sin.
[00:26:19.720 --> 00:26:25.520]   Whether it be I make God look like me, I make God look like something that serves me, it
[00:26:25.520 --> 00:26:29.080]   is a dethroning of the Lord above.
[00:26:29.080 --> 00:26:31.840]   That is at the heart of idolatry.
[00:26:31.840 --> 00:26:37.920]   Now in talking about all of these things, in talking about all of these things, we have
[00:26:37.920 --> 00:26:44.160]   to exercise great discernment, right?
[00:26:44.160 --> 00:26:51.600]   Because we realize that the tipping point from, you know, completely legitimate pursuit
[00:26:51.600 --> 00:26:59.200]   of money, success, our ambitions, and happiness, the tipping point is not so clear, is it?
[00:26:59.200 --> 00:27:03.880]   And what's crazy and dangerous about it is the tipping point is not so clear, but it
[00:27:03.880 --> 00:27:06.880]   could also happen so rapidly, right?
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:09.200]   Almost instantaneously.
[00:27:09.200 --> 00:27:15.920]   And so Apostle Paul again is calling the Christians at Corinth to not practice the kind of righteousness
[00:27:15.920 --> 00:27:18.760]   to which they say, "Well, here's the line.
[00:27:18.760 --> 00:27:21.680]   I haven't done anything wrong."
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:24.200]   Because in his eyes, that's not maturity.
[00:27:24.200 --> 00:27:28.600]   But in his eyes, the various forms of idolatry that will enter into our hearts, enter into
[00:27:28.600 --> 00:27:33.040]   our church, you are mature enough to see, right?
[00:27:33.040 --> 00:27:35.160]   And then to flee.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:41.660]   So he mentions that, but in summary, or not in summary, but in moving forward, he talks
[00:27:41.660 --> 00:27:44.000]   about another aspect of it.
[00:27:44.000 --> 00:27:49.560]   He says, "No, but I say that the things which the Gentiles sacrifice, they sacrifice to
[00:27:49.560 --> 00:27:52.320]   demons and not to God.
[00:27:52.320 --> 00:27:56.400]   And I do not want you to become shares in demons."
[00:27:56.400 --> 00:27:57.400]   Okay?
[00:27:57.400 --> 00:27:59.760]   And that point's just obvious.
[00:27:59.760 --> 00:28:03.440]   Why flee from idolatry?
[00:28:03.440 --> 00:28:06.120]   Because it's demonic.
[00:28:06.120 --> 00:28:08.400]   Right?
[00:28:08.400 --> 00:28:17.940]   So here, I wanted to ask you guys the question, do you believe that demons attack believers
[00:28:17.940 --> 00:28:25.320]   either in the Bible or today?
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:28.400]   And then I'm gonna ask probably a follow-up question, which is like, what does that look
[00:28:28.400 --> 00:28:36.480]   like, you know?
[00:28:36.480 --> 00:28:37.480]   So anyone?
[00:28:37.480 --> 00:28:43.920]   Do you believe that demons, and I'm talking specifically attacking believers, Christians,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:47.160]   do demons attack Christians?
[00:28:47.160 --> 00:28:50.480]   And I'm gonna ask follow-up is, what do you think that looks like?
[00:28:50.480 --> 00:28:52.280]   - Yes.
[00:28:52.280 --> 00:28:55.080]   - Okay, yes.
[00:28:55.080 --> 00:28:56.080]   And then the follow-up question is?
[00:28:56.080 --> 00:28:57.080]   - I don't have to say that part.
[00:28:57.080 --> 00:28:58.080]   - What?
[00:28:58.080 --> 00:28:59.080]   - I said Matthew's gonna answer that.
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:00.080]   - Oh, nice.
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.080]   Tag.
[00:29:01.080 --> 00:29:02.080]   - Yeah, absolutely.
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:03.080]   I totally agree.
[00:29:03.080 --> 00:29:04.080]   - Nice.
[00:29:04.080 --> 00:29:05.080]   - So, it looks like, in part, even what it says here, like, I guess in the next part
[00:29:05.080 --> 00:29:06.080]   of the passage, like, it could be a direct attack on us, but it could be an attack,
[00:29:06.080 --> 00:29:07.080]   like, where maybe we use the word "demon" to describe a demon, and then we use the word
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:08.080]   "Christian" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:08.080 --> 00:29:09.080]   And then we use the word "demon" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:09.080 --> 00:29:10.080]   And then we use the word "demon" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:10.080 --> 00:29:11.080]   And then we use the word "Christian" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:12.080]   And then we use the word "demon" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.080]   And then we use the word "demon" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:13.080 --> 00:29:40.920]   And then we use the word "demon" to describe a Christian.
[00:29:40.920 --> 00:29:50.760]   - Okay.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:30:06.080]   Cool.
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:07.480]   Thank you.
[00:30:07.480 --> 00:30:10.880]   Anybody else want to add to that, or just even just...
[00:30:10.880 --> 00:30:16.920]   So if you guys ever wonder that kind of question, you know, people have asked me a lot of times,
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:20.280]   do demons, like, internally influence us?
[00:30:20.280 --> 00:30:22.320]   That's why I pose the question.
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.040]   It's like, does a demon, like, cause me to say stuff?
[00:30:27.040 --> 00:30:31.360]   You know, if he's gonna attack the church and his unity, does he make me say nasty things
[00:30:31.360 --> 00:30:33.240]   and all that kind of stuff?
[00:30:33.240 --> 00:30:35.640]   And so, you know, there are questions about that.
[00:30:35.640 --> 00:30:41.520]   And I'm not gonna answer those questions specifically, but I do also concur.
[00:30:41.520 --> 00:30:47.080]   Demons, the demonic forces, Satan, they try.
[00:30:47.080 --> 00:30:51.720]   They do whatever they can to attack Christians today.
[00:30:51.720 --> 00:30:58.520]   And sometimes I feel like that's kind of a blind spot to just modern Christianity, you
[00:30:58.520 --> 00:30:59.800]   know?
[00:30:59.800 --> 00:31:06.480]   Maybe there are those people who make much of it, and that could be even one of Satan's
[00:31:06.480 --> 00:31:07.480]   strategies too.
[00:31:07.480 --> 00:31:12.080]   It's like, get them so engulfed in one aspect of your spiritual life that that's all you
[00:31:12.080 --> 00:31:15.880]   really ever think about.
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:21.960]   But in my mind, when I think about this truth, he's like, there is a spiritual realm here.
[00:31:21.960 --> 00:31:27.600]   I mean, he's trying to talk about the physical, which was the cup, the bread, the statue,
[00:31:27.600 --> 00:31:29.680]   the meat, and all that kind of stuff.
[00:31:29.680 --> 00:31:34.440]   But then he wants the Christians to be mature enough to observe the spiritual, right?
[00:31:34.440 --> 00:31:40.880]   And he says the spiritual is, there is this representation of their demonic worship, of
[00:31:40.880 --> 00:31:45.760]   their demonic influence, of their deception, and what is the twisted, perverted truth,
[00:31:45.760 --> 00:31:46.760]   right?
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:48.960]   And then I take a moment to think about that.
[00:31:48.960 --> 00:31:53.960]   And how many of you guys were with us when we read that book, Darkness and the Glory?
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.880]   Okay, a good number of you.
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.380]   I recommend it to you.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:02.920]   Some of it, it sounds like conspiracy theory and it's a little confusing.
[00:32:02.920 --> 00:32:05.680]   Some of it's like gold, okay?
[00:32:05.680 --> 00:32:13.040]   But the main argument in that book is that Satan, being the father of deception, is so
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:21.520]   deceived himself, and he has so deceived himself, he believes he can win.
[00:32:21.520 --> 00:32:28.160]   Satan believes he can usurp the hand of God and deceive the Christian to fail.
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:33.760]   Satan believes that he can so attack Christ that Christ would fail.
[00:32:33.760 --> 00:32:39.120]   And so the argument in that book is, not only is the spiritual battle alive, and not only
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:46.680]   is it rampant, Satan will literally do every single thing in his power, every single arsenal,
[00:32:46.680 --> 00:32:50.660]   every arrow, every scheme, every lie, Satan will throw.
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:54.400]   And the book makes the argument that whatever Satan has, he threw at Christ and he's gonna
[00:32:54.400 --> 00:32:57.520]   throw at you.
[00:32:57.520 --> 00:32:59.480]   And I kinda see that.
[00:32:59.480 --> 00:33:04.040]   So someone can ask me, "Hey, do you think Satan is gonna try to use our words?"
[00:33:04.040 --> 00:33:10.200]   I'm like, "I don't believe Satan or the devils have control over a Christian, because we're
[00:33:10.200 --> 00:33:12.760]   indwelt by the Holy Spirit.
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.480]   But would he use words?
[00:33:14.480 --> 00:33:15.520]   Yeah.
[00:33:15.520 --> 00:33:18.440]   Would he use whatever he could?
[00:33:18.440 --> 00:33:19.680]   Yeah.
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:23.320]   Would he use certain people who came in and they were teaching false stuff?
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:24.320]   Yes he would.
[00:33:24.320 --> 00:33:26.520]   And Apostle Paul is very clear.
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:27.520]   That's gonna happen.
[00:33:27.520 --> 00:33:29.280]   That's one of Satan's schemes.
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:30.280]   You throw him out.
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:31.280]   Don't listen to him.
[00:33:31.280 --> 00:33:33.120]   Don't invite him into your home.
[00:33:33.120 --> 00:33:34.120]   Right?
[00:33:34.120 --> 00:33:35.120]   But it's gonna happen.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.640]   There's gonna be people who are coming through those doors, claiming to be Christians, but
[00:33:37.640 --> 00:33:40.200]   will teach falsehood.
[00:33:40.200 --> 00:33:41.200]   Will Satan attack leaders?
[00:33:41.200 --> 00:33:42.200]   Yes he will.
[00:33:42.200 --> 00:33:43.800]   Will Satan attack the members?
[00:33:43.800 --> 00:33:44.800]   Yes he will.
[00:33:44.800 --> 00:33:49.360]   Satan will stop at nothing to thwart us.
[00:33:49.360 --> 00:33:54.320]   And that's one of the things I just want us to highlight is just like, and so he's calling
[00:33:54.320 --> 00:33:56.480]   these Christians to mature a bit here.
[00:33:56.480 --> 00:34:02.680]   And he's saying, you know, like, do you see, you know, what you're espousing when you don't
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:05.880]   care about the other Christians and you say, well, this is my right.
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.600]   Well, this is my freedom.
[00:34:07.600 --> 00:34:10.080]   Well, this is my liberty and I know what's best.
[00:34:10.080 --> 00:34:11.080]   I know what's right.
[00:34:11.080 --> 00:34:13.120]   I'm completely legitimate in doing this.
[00:34:13.120 --> 00:34:18.800]   It's like, man, don't you know the spiritual battle is real?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   Okay?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:21.120]   All right.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:27.800]   So that's verses 19 through 21 for the blank is spiritual reality, right?
[00:34:27.800 --> 00:34:28.800]   Spiritual reality.
[00:34:28.800 --> 00:34:36.960]   And to sum that up, he's essentially saying flee from idolatry because it's demonic, because
[00:34:36.960 --> 00:34:39.480]   it represents demonic activity.
[00:34:39.480 --> 00:34:40.480]   Okay.
[00:34:40.480 --> 00:34:44.480]   Did I give you the blank for number, the first one?
[00:34:44.480 --> 00:34:46.680]   I can't remember.
[00:34:46.680 --> 00:34:49.120]   For verses 16, 18?
[00:34:49.120 --> 00:34:55.480]   Well, if I didn't, it's a conflict of fellowship.
[00:34:55.480 --> 00:35:00.160]   You can't, you can't fellowship in two camps.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:01.680]   All right.
[00:35:01.680 --> 00:35:02.680]   Next section.
[00:35:02.680 --> 00:35:04.760]   Can I have Jonas Alejo?
[00:35:04.760 --> 00:35:06.720]   Can you read verse 22 please?
[00:35:06.720 --> 00:35:08.800]   Oh, sorry.
[00:35:08.800 --> 00:35:09.960]   Yes.
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.200]   22.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.480]   Okay.
[00:35:12.480 --> 00:35:21.320]   So we provoke the Lord to jealousy.
[00:35:21.320 --> 00:35:24.320]   Are we stronger than he?
[00:35:24.320 --> 00:35:25.320]   Okay.
[00:35:25.320 --> 00:35:30.320]   So we're taking a look here at verse 22 and it says, or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
[00:35:30.320 --> 00:35:32.760]   We are not stronger than he, are we?
[00:35:32.760 --> 00:35:34.000]   Right?
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:37.960]   And so this to me, again, pose another reason.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:41.600]   So the fleeing moral, uh, idolatry, right?
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:44.840]   And it had this idea of what you share in.
[00:35:44.840 --> 00:35:49.880]   And then when he said, what I mean is, that's how I'd split that up and said, okay, that's
[00:35:49.880 --> 00:35:55.160]   an indicator where he's at least making another premise or just building on top.
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:36:00.240]   And then when he said, or that's when I realized, okay, he's probably doing another argument
[00:36:00.240 --> 00:36:03.400]   and thinking, helping us think of something else.
[00:36:03.400 --> 00:36:13.640]   And this, the reason why I, if I were to, you know, entitle this as a sermon, I would
[00:36:13.640 --> 00:36:16.120]   call it like true maturity.
[00:36:16.120 --> 00:36:21.280]   Although it's talking about true idolatry or flee from idolatry, I'll talk about as
[00:36:21.280 --> 00:36:29.840]   true maturity is because to me, in my mind, a truly mature Christian always asked the
[00:36:29.840 --> 00:36:33.480]   question, what about God?
[00:36:33.480 --> 00:36:34.840]   Right?
[00:36:34.840 --> 00:36:40.800]   A really mature Christian will ask the question, well, what does God think of it?
[00:36:40.800 --> 00:36:46.800]   Because that maturity is a maturity as a son who considers the father, a daughter who is
[00:36:46.800 --> 00:36:50.960]   in tune with the father's heart, right?
[00:36:50.960 --> 00:36:55.200]   Someone who has read the scriptures enough, has prayed, has communed with God, is going
[00:36:55.200 --> 00:37:01.400]   to have a sense for what pleases the Lord or displeases the Lord.
[00:37:01.400 --> 00:37:05.960]   Someone who has really been in harmony with God is going to feel sensitivity.
[00:37:05.960 --> 00:37:10.520]   Well, what about God?
[00:37:10.520 --> 00:37:13.960]   And that to me is a mark of somebody who is very, very mature.
[00:37:13.960 --> 00:37:16.040]   I don't think I could do that.
[00:37:16.040 --> 00:37:17.040]   Why?
[00:37:17.040 --> 00:37:18.040]   There's no problem with this.
[00:37:18.040 --> 00:37:20.160]   Like, I just, I don't know how God would think of that.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:24.880]   I think I would look at that and, and they're able to say that because they've thought
[00:37:24.880 --> 00:37:28.920]   deeply of what the Lord's perspective on us would be.
[00:37:28.920 --> 00:37:33.160]   A selfish child, a child who's living in the moment, a child who's living on earth, simply
[00:37:33.160 --> 00:37:36.640]   in the material, simply here and now.
[00:37:36.640 --> 00:37:42.240]   They're considering immediate cost benefits, immediate risk, immediate kickback, how it
[00:37:42.240 --> 00:37:43.720]   affects me.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:48.320]   But the child of God who is mature is thinking on a broader scale.
[00:37:48.320 --> 00:37:50.800]   But what about God?
[00:37:50.800 --> 00:37:53.420]   How does he view this?
[00:37:53.420 --> 00:37:55.120]   And that's essentially what he's saying.
[00:37:55.120 --> 00:38:01.360]   He's asking this question, or do we provoke the Lord to jealousy?
[00:38:01.360 --> 00:38:07.000]   And it immediately brings into question, how would God look at this?
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:11.080]   And I want you to turn to a scary passage in Deuteronomy chapter 32.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:15.120]   Deuteronomy chapter 32.
[00:38:15.120 --> 00:38:21.680]   And I call it a scary passage because if you read the whole chapter, it's pretty scary.
[00:38:21.680 --> 00:38:25.520]   It sounds almost just like the segments of revelations where you just, it's hard to keep
[00:38:25.520 --> 00:38:29.920]   reading because it's just like so descriptive of the kind of wrath that God is going to
[00:38:29.920 --> 00:38:32.660]   impose on the earth.
[00:38:32.660 --> 00:38:37.900]   But in chapter 32, starting from verse 19, okay, Deuteronomy chapter 32, starting from
[00:38:37.900 --> 00:38:47.340]   verse 19, it says, "The Lord saw this and spurned them because of the provocation of
[00:38:47.340 --> 00:38:49.480]   his sons and daughters.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:53.220]   Then he said, 'I will hide my face from them.
[00:38:53.220 --> 00:38:58.680]   I will see what their end shall be, for they are a perverse generation, sons in whom is
[00:38:58.680 --> 00:39:00.500]   no faithfulness.
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:03.500]   They have made me jealous with what is not God.
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:07.600]   They have provoked me to anger with their idols, so I will make them jealous with those
[00:39:07.600 --> 00:39:08.740]   who are not a people.
[00:39:08.740 --> 00:39:12.480]   I will provoke them to anger with the foolish nation.
[00:39:12.480 --> 00:39:17.540]   For a fire is kindled in my anger and burns to the lowest part of Sheol and consumes the
[00:39:17.540 --> 00:39:21.860]   earth with its shield and sets on fire the foundations of the mountains.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:23.420]   I will heap misfortunes on them.
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:24.740]   I will use my arrows on them.
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:29.060]   They will be wasted by famine and consumed by plagues or bitter destruction.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.460]   And the teeth of beasts I will send upon them, with the venom of crawling things of dust.
[00:39:33.460 --> 00:39:36.200]   Outside the sword will bereave and inside terror.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:41.340]   Both young man and virgin, but the nurseling and the man, gray in hair, I would have said,
[00:39:41.340 --> 00:39:42.940]   I will cut them to pieces.
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.340]   I will remove the memory of them from men.'"
[00:39:45.340 --> 00:39:50.540]   That's one of those passages where it's kind of crazy because you see what he's saying,
[00:39:50.540 --> 00:39:54.820]   he's just like, "They provoked me to such anger.
[00:39:54.820 --> 00:39:57.300]   I'm going to have such vengeance on them.
[00:39:57.300 --> 00:40:00.100]   I'm going to completely turn the whole tables upside down.
[00:40:00.100 --> 00:40:02.980]   You provoke me to anger, I'm going to provoke you.
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.300]   And after you've been provoked, I'm going to completely destroy you.
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:11.300]   Both the babies, both the senior citizens, everybody.
[00:40:11.300 --> 00:40:14.420]   And not a single soul will ever remember you because you will be annihilated."
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:16.580]   I mean, that's the kind of stuff that he's saying, right?
[00:40:16.580 --> 00:40:20.020]   That's what I mean when I say, man, it reads just like Revelation.
[00:40:20.020 --> 00:40:22.100]   It's just kind of scary.
[00:40:22.100 --> 00:40:29.680]   But the fact of the matter is, if we were to ask, what about God?
[00:40:29.680 --> 00:40:35.020]   We realize God is a jealous God.
[00:40:35.020 --> 00:40:37.540]   That much is clear in the Bible.
[00:40:37.540 --> 00:40:40.980]   And I ask you this question.
[00:40:40.980 --> 00:40:43.780]   Paul says, "Flee idolatry."
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:49.380]   And his last point clearly is, because God is a jealous God.
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:55.300]   How would you explain that to a young Christian?
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:00.020]   How would you explain that to somebody who's new to the faith and maybe all they've heard
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:03.780]   is like, "And God has a great plan for you, huge hope for the future.
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:06.860]   Come into the church, learn the Bible, have fellowship.
[00:41:06.860 --> 00:41:08.340]   Do you want to find community?
[00:41:08.340 --> 00:41:09.860]   Here you are."
[00:41:09.860 --> 00:41:16.460]   And then he learns Deuteronomy chapter 32 and he's just like, "Duh."
[00:41:16.460 --> 00:41:19.140]   How do you explain that?
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.140]   Anybody want to take a shot at that, please?
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:45.140]   Someone in our table offered the example of marriage.
[00:41:45.140 --> 00:41:59.940]   Good.
[00:41:59.940 --> 00:42:03.060]   I like how you use the word "the right."
[00:42:03.060 --> 00:42:07.020]   The right.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:14.780]   You know, Pastor Peter posted up a testimony recently of a professor who was part of the
[00:42:14.780 --> 00:42:19.980]   gay and lesbian community and through a lot of going back and forth with Christians and
[00:42:19.980 --> 00:42:25.900]   writing articles and she essentially was kind of a leader of that liberal camp and she was
[00:42:25.900 --> 00:42:30.940]   converted and I listened to it and I was just so thoroughly encouraged.
[00:42:30.940 --> 00:42:36.580]   If you guys haven't had a chance to listen to it, I really encourage that you do.
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:41.420]   Especially for those of you guys who perhaps never felt, you know, sometimes people ask
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:46.700]   me, "I believe in God, I have surrendered to God, but sometimes I don't feel it."
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:47.700]   She talks about that.
[00:42:47.700 --> 00:42:48.700]   She's like, "I've surrendered.
[00:42:48.700 --> 00:42:56.020]   I didn't have this burst of tears and emotions, but I surrendered."
[00:42:56.020 --> 00:43:00.660]   And in talking about the surrender, she gave this example and said, "A lot of the questions
[00:43:00.660 --> 00:43:06.060]   I get sometimes are weird because one of the most frequently asked questions is, 'Why
[00:43:06.060 --> 00:43:08.620]   can't you just be both?
[00:43:08.620 --> 00:43:13.220]   Why can't you just accept Christianity and still be lesbian?'"
[00:43:13.220 --> 00:43:17.340]   And then instead of answering the question, she just started to talk.
[00:43:17.340 --> 00:43:22.740]   And she started to talk about how God is Lord and she is not.
[00:43:22.740 --> 00:43:28.740]   So how can one have the audacity and the pride to tell God, "Well, this is how it shall be
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:32.500]   because I want both."
[00:43:32.500 --> 00:43:37.260]   And the reason why I like the fact that, you know, David said, "In the context when you
[00:43:37.260 --> 00:43:43.060]   have a right, then you have a right to be jealous."
[00:43:43.060 --> 00:43:45.180]   But God is God.
[00:43:45.180 --> 00:43:46.840]   He created everything.
[00:43:46.840 --> 00:43:48.420]   He owns everything.
[00:43:48.420 --> 00:43:49.740]   He's the one who gave us purpose.
[00:43:49.740 --> 00:43:51.020]   He's the one who gave us life.
[00:43:51.020 --> 00:43:54.900]   He's the one who sustains our existence.
[00:43:54.900 --> 00:43:57.420]   He has a right.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:43:58.500]   Okay?
[00:43:58.500 --> 00:44:03.300]   And where there is a right, there is a right to be jealous.
[00:44:03.300 --> 00:44:06.140]   And He has that right to perfection.
[00:44:06.140 --> 00:44:08.260]   He is Lord.
[00:44:08.260 --> 00:44:12.740]   And only when you understand the spiritual reality of God's Lordship, that God is God
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:17.380]   exalted and almighty, does this jealousy make sense.
[00:44:17.380 --> 00:44:18.940]   Right?
[00:44:18.940 --> 00:44:26.780]   And so as a kind of, you know, kind of summing up, summing up of the lesson today, let's
[00:44:26.780 --> 00:44:31.580]   stop there and really think about what is maturity, you know?
[00:44:31.580 --> 00:44:33.180]   Christian maturity.
[00:44:33.180 --> 00:44:36.660]   Christian maturity looks so much different than what the world would view as maturity,
[00:44:36.660 --> 00:44:38.340]   you know?
[00:44:38.340 --> 00:44:42.980]   Worldly maturity means I pay my own bills and I do what I want without my parents.
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:44.340]   Right?
[00:44:44.340 --> 00:44:47.180]   Worldly maturity means my parents don't tell me what to do anymore.
[00:44:47.180 --> 00:44:51.220]   I dictate what I do with my life.
[00:44:51.220 --> 00:44:56.980]   In the family of God, in the relationship of us as sons and daughters of God, that maturity
[00:44:56.980 --> 00:44:59.260]   looks quite different, you know?
[00:44:59.260 --> 00:45:05.340]   And I think Apostle Paul, through these passages, have been challenging us to not think on such
[00:45:05.340 --> 00:45:10.540]   a base level of, "Well, I did base minimum," or "I met the line, I've met the requirement,
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:13.340]   let me exercise my freedoms."
[00:45:13.340 --> 00:45:15.900]   Apostle Paul is saying, "Now you have the freedom.
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:16.980]   Glorify God.
[00:45:16.980 --> 00:45:17.980]   Consider Him.
[00:45:17.980 --> 00:45:18.980]   Represent."
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.460]   What a huge challenge for us, amen?
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:23.580]   Alright.
[00:45:23.580 --> 00:45:25.780]   Any questions about the passage today?
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:28.980]   Going from verse 14 to 22?
[00:45:28.980 --> 00:45:29.980]   Okay.
[00:45:29.980 --> 00:45:34.940]   Let's bow for a prayer and you guys can have your time of discussion.
[00:45:34.940 --> 00:45:35.940]   Okay?
[00:45:35.940 --> 00:45:42.900]   Heavenly Father, I thank you so much for your grace.
[00:45:42.900 --> 00:45:52.660]   God, I pray that in our spiritual lives, it is a battle truly of truth and comprehending
[00:45:52.660 --> 00:45:54.700]   and grasping reality.
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:46:00.460]   I pray, God, that we would live in the spiritual realities revealed to us by scripture.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:06.300]   I pray, God, that you would not allow us to live long simply by sight, but God, to live
[00:46:06.300 --> 00:46:07.900]   truly in faith.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:12.420]   I pray, Lord, that we would take the call to mature as Apostle Paul is expecting the
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:20.540]   church to not simply live by the letter of the law or simply live by what is base minimum,
[00:46:20.540 --> 00:46:24.020]   but really to represent God in this world and be a light.
[00:46:24.020 --> 00:46:28.740]   And I pray, Father God, that you would challenge us that whatever freedoms, whatever blessings
[00:46:28.740 --> 00:46:33.140]   we have, we would turn that all to your glory and honor.
[00:46:33.140 --> 00:46:35.140]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:46:35.140 --> 00:46:36.140]   Amen.
[00:46:36.140 --> 00:46:37.140]   Okay.
[00:46:37.140 --> 00:46:40.020]   Again, I tried my best with the discussion questions.
[00:46:40.020 --> 00:46:41.740]   Some of them not so good.
[00:46:41.740 --> 00:46:43.980]   The first one, I was like, "Have you ever been attacked?"
[00:46:43.980 --> 00:46:49.140]   What I mean by that is, have you ever felt like demonic, spiritual attack?
[00:46:49.140 --> 00:46:52.180]   If you have a good story of what it was like, tell the story.
[00:46:52.180 --> 00:46:54.340]   Tell me too later.
[00:46:54.340 --> 00:46:58.420]   And I'll tell you if it really is.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.980]   The other ones is just try to evaluate self.
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:04.100]   Are there anything that you feel is idolatry?
