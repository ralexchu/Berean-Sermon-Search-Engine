[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.200]   All right.
[00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:09.200]   Thank you for the praise team.
[00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.680]   Again, it's going to take a little bit of time adjusting to preaching to an empty room
[00:00:13.680 --> 00:00:16.920]   and leading praise with an empty room.
[00:00:16.920 --> 00:00:21.160]   You know, I was talking to a few of my friends who obviously all of them are doing the same
[00:00:21.160 --> 00:00:22.160]   thing.
[00:00:22.160 --> 00:00:24.880]   Some of them are preaching in their garage, some of them are preaching at church, some
[00:00:24.880 --> 00:00:27.040]   of them are preaching in their living room.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:29.200]   And we all share the same sentiment.
[00:00:29.200 --> 00:00:34.360]   It's very difficult to preach to an empty room because we don't know the response.
[00:00:34.360 --> 00:00:39.000]   And we are getting texts that there's some issues with the sound, so please be patient
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   with us.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:43.400]   Our AV team is working hard to kind of adjust that.
[00:00:43.400 --> 00:00:46.200]   So again, you don't all need to be texting in.
[00:00:46.200 --> 00:00:50.460]   I think a few of the pastors and the leaders are texting in and saying that.
[00:00:50.460 --> 00:00:55.720]   So if you, you know, just be patient with us as we get these kinks out.
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:58.840]   And you know, I'm concerned that I may get too comfortable with preaching to an empty
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:01.480]   room and then I have to adjust when you guys come back.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.480]   You know, and I'm going to be just preaching too fast or something.
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:08.840]   The text that we're going to be looking at this morning is in John chapter 6, the whole
[00:01:08.840 --> 00:01:13.200]   chapter, chapter 6 verses 1 through 71.
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.480]   And we're going to be expositing every single word, so obviously not, you know, there's
[00:01:19.480 --> 00:01:20.720]   too many verses.
[00:01:20.720 --> 00:01:26.120]   We're going to be highlighting, this is a very, very important passage in the ministry
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:27.120]   of Jesus.
[00:01:27.120 --> 00:01:32.840]   And it's going to start us off on the seven "I am" statements of Christ.
[00:01:32.840 --> 00:01:36.160]   I don't think I'll be preaching each one each week.
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:41.320]   Some weeks I may double up because next couple of weeks we have Palm Sunday and Easter Sunday.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:45.520]   So we want to make sure that our preaching is appropriate to that.
[00:01:45.520 --> 00:01:50.760]   But for today, we're kicking off, and again, this is not a text that many of you should
[00:01:50.760 --> 00:01:51.880]   be unfamiliar with.
[00:01:51.880 --> 00:01:58.280]   I actually taught on this probably at least once or twice in the last maybe about four
[00:01:58.280 --> 00:01:59.280]   or five years.
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:01.680]   But again, to kick us off on the right direction.
[00:02:01.680 --> 00:02:06.320]   So let me read this, a small portion of it, and then we'll get, we'll jump right into
[00:02:06.320 --> 00:02:07.320]   it.
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:13.520]   Starting from verse 32 to verse 36, "Jesus then said to them, 'Truly, truly, I say to
[00:02:13.520 --> 00:02:18.640]   you, it is not Moses who has given you the bread out of heaven, but it is my Father who
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:20.360]   gives you the true bread out of heaven.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:24.760]   For the bread of God is that which comes down out of heaven and gives life to the world.'
[00:02:24.760 --> 00:02:28.200]   Then they said to him, 'Lord, always give us this bread.'
[00:02:28.200 --> 00:02:30.160]   Jesus said to them, 'I am the bread of life.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:34.680]   He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes in me will never thirst.
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:38.960]   But I said to you that you have seen me, and yet you do not believe.'"
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.960]   Let's pray.
[00:02:41.960 --> 00:02:51.440]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your Word would go forth and that it would do the work that
[00:02:51.440 --> 00:02:59.760]   you have ordained, especially now, Father God, as our lives, our church, the whole world,
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:02.480]   Lord, has been flipped upside down.
[00:03:02.480 --> 00:03:09.040]   And reminding us, Lord, how weak we are, how finite we are, and how desperate we are to
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:12.840]   know you, to hear from you, to be guided by you.
[00:03:12.840 --> 00:03:14.920]   We need your wisdom more than ever.
[00:03:14.920 --> 00:03:19.800]   We need the light of your Word to cut through the darkness so that we may see clearly.
[00:03:19.800 --> 00:03:22.240]   Lord, we desire to love you.
[00:03:22.240 --> 00:03:24.520]   We desire to worship you.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   We desire to believe you.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:32.520]   Help us, Lord God, to open our eyes that we may see the true glory of the gospel of Jesus
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:39.480]   Christ, that your Word would have its effect, sanctify us, renew us.
[00:03:39.480 --> 00:03:42.920]   Bless us this morning, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:03:42.920 --> 00:03:45.280]   And again, it's been a couple weeks.
[00:03:45.280 --> 00:03:49.520]   Some of you guys have been, you know, cooped up at home for longer than that, and I know
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:54.480]   many of you are going to work, especially our health workers, first responders, you
[00:03:54.480 --> 00:03:59.240]   know, people who are working in essential things that you're doing.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:03.400]   So it seems like to me, percentage-wise, maybe about half or a little bit more than half
[00:04:03.400 --> 00:04:08.680]   are staying home, and then the other half are actually going out and, you know, risking
[00:04:08.680 --> 00:04:15.080]   their health to keep the health situation, the hospitals running and tech stuff that's
[00:04:15.080 --> 00:04:16.080]   going on.
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:23.640]   And so know that we are praying for you, and hopefully that it won't last long.
[00:04:23.640 --> 00:04:27.840]   You know, I was thinking about the timing of this, all of this, and it probably was
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:32.840]   really bad for, you know, a lot of the university students, because you were just about to get
[00:04:32.840 --> 00:04:36.840]   into the finals, and then you had spring break this week.
[00:04:36.840 --> 00:04:41.840]   And probably many of you had plans to do something, especially you seniors, since this is your
[00:04:41.840 --> 00:04:47.240]   last hoorah before, you know, going off into the sunset and getting a job and, you know,
[00:04:47.240 --> 00:04:49.240]   living however, right?
[00:04:49.240 --> 00:04:52.480]   And so this was your last hoorah, so I know there's a great disappointment in many of
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:53.480]   you.
[00:04:53.480 --> 00:04:54.720]   Some of you guys who are in the finance industry.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:05:00.080]   I mean, the market just went crazy, and you were disappointed in other ways.
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.160]   Many of you who own businesses, and you're dependent on these businesses.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:10.040]   I mean, what a bad time to be business owners right now, and again, we feel for you, and
[00:05:10.040 --> 00:05:13.600]   we'll see how this is going to end up.
[00:05:13.600 --> 00:05:17.120]   But again, even with the stimulus package, and I can't imagine the stress that you guys
[00:05:17.120 --> 00:05:18.120]   are in.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:24.440]   There are actually several couples that I've known outside the church who have canceled
[00:05:24.440 --> 00:05:28.360]   their wedding because of this, and again, we have couples in our church.
[00:05:28.360 --> 00:05:33.000]   We have one who's already canceled their wedding, and then we have other couples who is coming
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.560]   up in the next couple months, and they are wrestling right now with whether they need
[00:05:37.560 --> 00:05:39.680]   to be moving it back.
[00:05:39.680 --> 00:05:43.960]   And so what a stressful time for many of you.
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:49.320]   In many ways, every single one of us has been affected, and I, you know, for me and my family,
[00:05:49.320 --> 00:05:50.920]   it's probably been the easiest.
[00:05:50.920 --> 00:05:55.600]   And again, as I've mentioned, there's been a good blessing to be able to spend more time
[00:05:55.600 --> 00:06:01.800]   with the children, but as I and many of us are waiting this out, I feel for a lot of
[00:06:01.800 --> 00:06:04.280]   you who are in the midst of a turmoil.
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:05.960]   And again, it's not just us.
[00:06:05.960 --> 00:06:08.720]   This is going on all over the world.
[00:06:08.720 --> 00:06:14.400]   In fact, this week, Tokyo had to finally come out and say that they're going to have to
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:17.640]   cancel or postpone the Olympics.
[00:06:17.640 --> 00:06:23.560]   And to understand the gravity of that, that has only happened three times before, and
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:30.280]   each of those times that an Olympic was canceled or postponed, it happened because of war,
[00:06:30.280 --> 00:06:33.320]   World War I and World War II.
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:40.340]   And interestingly, one of those times was also supposed to be held in Tokyo, and they
[00:06:40.340 --> 00:06:43.720]   also had to cancel it because of World War II.
[00:06:43.720 --> 00:06:48.960]   So I remember talking to a Japanese businessman just a couple weeks ago before all this started,
[00:06:48.960 --> 00:06:52.760]   how he was getting information from his company in Japan saying that, telling him that he
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:56.920]   may not be able to come home, and they were so worried because the Japanese economy was
[00:06:56.920 --> 00:07:02.320]   already struggling, and to postpone or to cancel this Olympic would have devastating
[00:07:02.320 --> 00:07:04.280]   effects upon their economy.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:06.000]   Obviously, we're all hurting.
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.880]   Every country is hurting, but to have a country to pour billions and billions of dollars preparing
[00:07:10.880 --> 00:07:15.920]   for this, hotels being built, stadiums being built, especially in an economy that has already
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:21.880]   been struggling, and it was a very, very big decision they had to make.
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:27.040]   So what is going on right now, it is not about individual stuff that's going on.
[00:07:27.040 --> 00:07:31.240]   It's not just one family, one church, or even one country.
[00:07:31.240 --> 00:07:34.160]   This devastation is affecting everybody.
[00:07:34.160 --> 00:07:38.280]   And I've already shared online that I've been speaking to our Indian pastors, and even in
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:41.720]   the remote villages, it's getting around.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.840]   So the government actually shut down even villages, that they're not allowed to go to
[00:07:45.840 --> 00:07:47.520]   school, they're not allowed to come out.
[00:07:47.520 --> 00:07:52.280]   And so they've actually put a hard timeline of one month that they can't come out.
[00:07:52.280 --> 00:07:56.880]   And so for us, we have online, we can still go to the supermarkets and pick up stuff,
[00:07:56.880 --> 00:08:00.480]   but imagine in the villages, if they can't come out, what kind of effects that they're
[00:08:00.480 --> 00:08:02.400]   going to be feeling after about a month.
[00:08:02.400 --> 00:08:06.620]   So this is affecting almost every human being alive.
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:13.040]   And so it requires us to pray, it requires us to really seek God.
[00:08:13.040 --> 00:08:17.840]   And I think that's why it's appropriate for us as Christians, that we really focus our
[00:08:17.840 --> 00:08:22.140]   attention during this time upon who Christ is.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:27.560]   Right now, as the world is looking for answers, you know, who has the antivirus, what country
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:32.720]   is doing the best job, what hospitals are handling this virus well, what leaders are
[00:08:32.720 --> 00:08:36.840]   making the right decisions, and we are looking for all kinds of answers.
[00:08:36.840 --> 00:08:40.240]   And all of these things are necessary.
[00:08:40.240 --> 00:08:47.180]   But as Christians, we believe that the answer is ultimately found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:08:47.180 --> 00:08:51.040]   There is no authority, the Bible says, that has been established that has not been established
[00:08:51.040 --> 00:08:52.040]   by God himself.
[00:08:52.040 --> 00:08:58.520]   So it would be severely short-sighted to simply think that if we had the right leaders, if
[00:08:58.520 --> 00:09:02.580]   we made the right decisions, if we had the right money allocated at the right place,
[00:09:02.580 --> 00:09:05.440]   that all this is just simply going to go away.
[00:09:05.440 --> 00:09:09.760]   To recognize that what is happening around the world right now is symptomatic of the
[00:09:09.760 --> 00:09:14.200]   warning that the Bible has been giving all this time, whether we are living in plenty
[00:09:14.200 --> 00:09:19.120]   or whether we are living in want, whether we are socializing with our friends, whether
[00:09:19.120 --> 00:09:24.480]   we are living in safety and abundance, the Bible warns us there is a spiritual reality
[00:09:24.480 --> 00:09:29.240]   behind all of that that causes us to seek Christ.
[00:09:29.240 --> 00:09:35.320]   You know, the good thing about all of this, even with all the tragedy, is that the facade
[00:09:35.320 --> 00:09:37.880]   has been taken away.
[00:09:37.880 --> 00:09:41.960]   And the reality of the situation of mankind has been revealed to the world.
[00:09:41.960 --> 00:09:45.040]   We are helpless.
[00:09:45.040 --> 00:09:50.520]   Even if we find a cure to this virus, even if the businesses go back and the stock market
[00:09:50.520 --> 00:09:56.760]   just skyrockets back into where it is, what you and I are experiencing now is something
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:10:03.240]   that the Bible has been warning from the beginning of human history, that all have sinned and
[00:10:03.240 --> 00:10:06.920]   fall short of the glory of God.
[00:10:06.920 --> 00:10:13.320]   And so it is now more than ever that you and I diligently seek the glory of God.
[00:10:13.320 --> 00:10:15.200]   And that's what these "I Am" statements are.
[00:10:15.200 --> 00:10:22.560]   The seven "I Am" statements is Christ connecting Himself to Exodus chapter 3 when Yahweh introduced
[00:10:22.560 --> 00:10:26.600]   Himself and says, "I Am that I Am has sent you."
[00:10:26.600 --> 00:10:28.640]   How do I introduce you?
[00:10:28.640 --> 00:10:29.640]   How can I go to Israel?
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:34.880]   How can I go to Pharaoh and say, "This tiny little nation is going to be delivered.
[00:10:34.880 --> 00:10:37.480]   Who do I say has sent me?"
[00:10:37.480 --> 00:10:39.960]   Tell them, "I Am has sent you."
[00:10:39.960 --> 00:10:42.600]   And so we talked about that last week.
[00:10:42.600 --> 00:10:48.560]   And so the connection today is it's clear that Jesus' "I Am" statement was not an inconsequential
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:49.560]   statement.
[00:10:49.560 --> 00:10:51.560]   It's just not the word to be.
[00:10:51.560 --> 00:10:56.400]   And He just happened to be using that in just an average sentence.
[00:10:56.400 --> 00:11:02.520]   In fact, in the Greek structure, the "I Am" statement is "ego-ai-me."
[00:11:02.520 --> 00:11:06.160]   And both words have similar meaning.
[00:11:06.160 --> 00:11:09.320]   The both words, the root word is "to be."
[00:11:09.320 --> 00:11:14.400]   So if you were to read it literally, Jesus actually says in Greek, "I Am, I Am."
[00:11:14.400 --> 00:11:15.800]   And it sounds redundant.
[00:11:15.800 --> 00:11:21.200]   But the reason why He does that is because in the Septuagint, the Greek translation of
[00:11:21.200 --> 00:11:28.480]   Exodus, that's exactly how that verse is translated, "ego-ai-me."
[00:11:28.480 --> 00:11:34.760]   So when Jesus says in the seven "I Am" statements, He is referring Himself to that same God that
[00:11:34.760 --> 00:11:37.880]   Moses met at the burning bush.
[00:11:37.880 --> 00:11:39.320]   Tell them, "I Am has sent me."
[00:11:39.320 --> 00:11:46.680]   So Jesus says in the seven distinct statements, "I Am the bread of life."
[00:11:46.680 --> 00:11:50.960]   These "I Am" statements are telling two things.
[00:11:50.960 --> 00:11:54.360]   One, clearly Jesus is God.
[00:11:54.360 --> 00:11:59.720]   In fact, one of the clearest places where Jesus identifies Himself as God is in chapter
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:00.720]   five.
[00:12:00.720 --> 00:12:02.360]   But we're not going to be studying that today.
[00:12:02.360 --> 00:12:08.400]   But after He lays that down, He continues on through the book of John, identifying Himself
[00:12:08.400 --> 00:12:11.360]   over and over and over and over again.
[00:12:11.360 --> 00:12:16.120]   So a Jew who was paying attention to Him closely would have clearly understood, even with just
[00:12:16.120 --> 00:12:21.320]   with one "I Am" statement, Jesus is not simply saying He's a prophet.
[00:12:21.320 --> 00:12:27.680]   Jesus is not simply saying that He's a rabbi or He's equal to the greatest of prophets
[00:12:27.680 --> 00:12:28.720]   in the Old Testament.
[00:12:28.720 --> 00:12:30.080]   He says He is above all of that.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:32.600]   He says He is God Himself.
[00:12:32.600 --> 00:12:36.140]   That's the first thing that these "I Am" statements are clarifying for us.
[00:12:36.140 --> 00:12:41.680]   But the second thing that He says, along with that, every one of these "I Am" statements
[00:12:41.680 --> 00:12:45.920]   tears down Israel's hopes that they put on.
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:50.560]   Kind of the religiousness, how they were looking for the Messiah to come and what they imagined
[00:12:50.560 --> 00:12:52.040]   the Messiah to be.
[00:12:52.040 --> 00:12:55.040]   How they thought the Messiah was going to come and He was going to bring this golden
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:12:57.420]   era of peace.
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:13:00.000]   That they're going to overthrow the Roman government.
[00:13:00.000 --> 00:13:03.280]   They're going to have plenty of food.
[00:13:03.280 --> 00:13:07.000]   And Israel is going to be restored back to whatever glory that they were thinking in
[00:13:07.000 --> 00:13:08.660]   their head.
[00:13:08.660 --> 00:13:15.400]   Every one of these "I Am" statements are breaking down the false hopes of mankind and making
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:21.320]   it very clear that if you put your hope in anything else, that you will hunger again
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:23.960]   and you will thirst again.
[00:13:23.960 --> 00:13:29.000]   And that's why I think it's very relevant for us to study the "I Am" statements of Christ.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:35.360]   Now that the outside facade of human history, you know, the curtain has been taken out and
[00:13:35.360 --> 00:13:41.000]   we see who we really are, in the end, we are helpless.
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:43.340]   We're absolutely helpless.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:48.380]   That our leaders aren't going to make the perfect decision to make this go away.
[00:13:48.380 --> 00:13:50.420]   Some of us are going to get sick.
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:53.040]   Some of us may die from that.
[00:13:53.040 --> 00:13:58.300]   But whether we make it through this and some of us get hurt by this, one thing is absolutely
[00:13:58.300 --> 00:14:00.720]   crystal clear.
[00:14:00.720 --> 00:14:05.480]   We will all suffer on our way to death.
[00:14:05.480 --> 00:14:07.120]   One hundred percent.
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.800]   One hundred percent.
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:13.880]   The only difference between each individual is when this is going to happen.
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:18.460]   Will it happen when we're young or will it happen when we're old?
[00:14:18.460 --> 00:14:22.480]   But in the end, the Bible says, "Inasmuch it is appointed for all men to die once, after
[00:14:22.480 --> 00:14:24.780]   this comes judgment."
[00:14:24.780 --> 00:14:28.760]   Our hope is found in Christ, in Christ alone.
[00:14:28.760 --> 00:14:33.280]   The first statement, "I am the bread of life."
[00:14:33.280 --> 00:14:37.200]   In order to understand the statement that he says later on in this chapter, we need
[00:14:37.200 --> 00:14:39.080]   to understand the context.
[00:14:39.080 --> 00:14:43.680]   Because Jesus is not just speaking in open air, just talking to anybody.
[00:14:43.680 --> 00:14:52.000]   He's talking to 5,000 people who just ate the miraculous bread and the miraculous fish.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.840]   There's only two miracles that are mentioned in the Gospels that are repeated in all four
[00:14:56.840 --> 00:14:57.840]   Gospels.
[00:14:57.840 --> 00:15:00.880]   Do you know what they are?
[00:15:00.880 --> 00:15:05.240]   This one and the other one is the resurrection of Christ.
[00:15:05.240 --> 00:15:09.800]   Those are the only two miracles that are repeated in all four Gospels.
[00:15:09.800 --> 00:15:13.480]   So that tells us the significance of this miracle.
[00:15:13.480 --> 00:15:16.520]   This was not one of many miracles.
[00:15:16.520 --> 00:15:24.400]   It happens to be a miracle where the rejection of Christ happens in this chapter.
[00:15:24.400 --> 00:15:28.680]   Usually when we think of rejection of Christ, we think about Christ coming in on Palm Sunday
[00:15:28.680 --> 00:15:31.120]   and then Him being crucified on the cross.
[00:15:31.120 --> 00:15:37.720]   Well, the rejection that happened in mass numbers really happens in this chapter.
[00:15:37.720 --> 00:15:43.560]   Up to this point, if you remember, every time He performs a miracle, He's concerned that
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:49.680]   His fame is going to spread all over and He would continue to tell the people who experience
[00:15:49.680 --> 00:15:52.440]   this miracle and saying, "Do not tell anybody yet.
[00:15:52.440 --> 00:15:53.440]   It is not time.
[00:15:53.440 --> 00:15:54.440]   It is not time."
[00:15:54.440 --> 00:15:58.200]   Well, that time has finally come.
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:05.640]   He deliberately performs this miracle to 5,000 adult male and most conservative commentaries
[00:16:05.640 --> 00:16:10.920]   will believe that somewhere between 15,000 to 20,000 people were with Him.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:14.400]   So this was very, very public.
[00:16:14.400 --> 00:16:19.560]   And it took place in the area where He did majority of His miracles.
[00:16:19.560 --> 00:16:21.800]   This is about two and a half years into His ministry.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:26.680]   It's about six months or less before He actually ends up going to Jerusalem.
[00:16:26.680 --> 00:16:33.360]   So He, after this happens, He's going to transition from His public ministry to His private ministry,
[00:16:33.360 --> 00:16:38.400]   primarily focused on His disciples, preparing them to go to the cross.
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:46.800]   So you can say that this is a turning point in His public ministry to His private ministry.
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:50.720]   So again, let's get to chapter 6.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:54.440]   Again, I'm not going to go into the details of all of this because I want to give you
[00:16:54.440 --> 00:16:57.360]   a broad picture of what happens.
[00:16:57.360 --> 00:17:03.080]   Chapter 6, 14 through 15, it says, "Therefore, when the people saw the sign which He had
[00:17:03.080 --> 00:17:08.760]   performed, they said, 'This is truly the prophet who is to come into the world.'
[00:17:08.760 --> 00:17:13.120]   So Jesus, perceiving that they were intending to come and take Him by force to make Him
[00:17:13.120 --> 00:17:16.640]   king, withdrew again to the mountain by Himself alone."
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:21.240]   Understandable.
[00:17:21.240 --> 00:17:28.880]   Every single one of these people who actually ate the miraculous bread, ate the miraculous
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:32.060]   fish, they probably heard.
[00:17:32.060 --> 00:17:33.400]   Maybe they had a friend.
[00:17:33.400 --> 00:17:35.300]   Maybe they had a friend of a friend.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:40.040]   Or maybe they just heard that in some remote village, Jesus was performing miracles and
[00:17:40.040 --> 00:17:44.800]   a blind man opened his eyes and a lame man was able to walk and He was able to calm the
[00:17:44.800 --> 00:17:45.800]   storm.
[00:17:45.800 --> 00:17:47.240]   And the storm has already spread.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.760]   And maybe there's some scattered people in this room who are firsthand eyewitnesses.
[00:17:52.760 --> 00:17:59.080]   But after the eating of the 5,000, every single one of them was able to touch and eat and
[00:17:59.080 --> 00:18:01.400]   digest this miraculous food.
[00:18:01.400 --> 00:18:04.820]   In fact, Jesus wanted to make it very clear.
[00:18:04.820 --> 00:18:09.400]   After He performs a miracle, how many baskets were left over?
[00:18:09.400 --> 00:18:11.000]   Twelve.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.960]   Now, why do you think there were 12 baskets?
[00:18:14.960 --> 00:18:18.640]   And who do you think were carrying them?
[00:18:18.640 --> 00:18:20.880]   The disciples.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:25.280]   So Jesus was not just only making it clear to the multitudes.
[00:18:25.280 --> 00:18:29.680]   Can you imagine the disciples who collected enough to fill 12 baskets and each one of
[00:18:29.680 --> 00:18:31.200]   them carrying them?
[00:18:31.200 --> 00:18:34.320]   And so they probably were eating that for the next week or two.
[00:18:34.320 --> 00:18:42.120]   And every time they ate it, it was a reminder to them that they were eating something miraculous.
[00:18:42.120 --> 00:18:43.800]   It was time.
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:50.160]   Jesus was preparing to go to the cross and He was declaring who He is.
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.320]   But in the very same chapter, at the end of this chapter, these people who are so elated
[00:18:55.320 --> 00:19:00.160]   with Christ wanted to forcefully make Him king.
[00:19:00.160 --> 00:19:06.560]   In chapter 666, it says, "As a result of this, many of His disciples withdrew and were
[00:19:06.560 --> 00:19:09.520]   not walking with Him anymore."
[00:19:09.520 --> 00:19:17.360]   The same people who wanted to make Him king, just a few verses later in the same chapter,
[00:19:17.360 --> 00:19:21.720]   said that because of this, they were no longer walking with Christ.
[00:19:21.720 --> 00:19:23.840]   What is this?
[00:19:23.840 --> 00:19:28.360]   What happened in between the feeding of the 5,000 and the rejection of Christ?
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:36.840]   That is a really important question because this is the turning point of Jesus' ministry.
[00:19:36.840 --> 00:19:42.520]   The miracle that leads to the crowds wanting to make Jesus king, it says in verse 14 and
[00:19:42.520 --> 00:19:45.400]   15 again, "They saw the signs.
[00:19:45.400 --> 00:19:50.440]   When the people saw the sign which He had performed, they said, 'This is truly the
[00:19:50.440 --> 00:19:51.440]   prophet.'"
[00:19:51.440 --> 00:19:53.960]   Let me stop right there.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.680]   Remember when Jesus asked the disciples, "Who do men say that I am?"
[00:19:58.680 --> 00:20:03.440]   And He said, "Some say you're Elijah, some say you're the prophet."
[00:20:03.440 --> 00:20:05.720]   And then He turns around and said, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.840]   And Jesus basically says, He's correcting them, "Well, who am I really?"
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.120]   And Peter says, "You are the Son, the Christ of the living God," or "the Christ, the Son
[00:20:15.120 --> 00:20:16.120]   of the living God."
[00:20:16.120 --> 00:20:24.680]   Well, these people saw the miracles of Christ and they knew He was not an ordinary man,
[00:20:24.680 --> 00:20:28.680]   but their faith did not come all the way.
[00:20:28.680 --> 00:20:29.680]   They were waiting for this prophet.
[00:20:29.680 --> 00:20:34.360]   They said, "He must be a prophet because a normal person can't be doing what He is doing."
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:38.960]   So no wonder they wanted to make Him king.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:43.640]   They wanted to make Him king because who wouldn't want a king like this?
[00:20:43.640 --> 00:20:47.480]   In fact, the king that they had now, Herod, they considered him to be a traitor.
[00:20:47.480 --> 00:20:49.960]   In fact, they didn't even acknowledge him as king.
[00:20:49.960 --> 00:20:55.520]   So the fact that Christ comes and He's healing people and He's feeding people, who wouldn't
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.320]   want this as your king?
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:03.320]   John 26, Jesus sees that they want to make Him king.
[00:21:03.320 --> 00:21:07.280]   He knows that they had defected faith and He breaks away from them for a rest and they
[00:21:07.280 --> 00:21:09.680]   find out that He's not there.
[00:21:09.680 --> 00:21:13.640]   So they pack up their bags next morning and they cross to the other side of where Jesus
[00:21:13.640 --> 00:21:16.240]   is and they finally find Christ.
[00:21:16.240 --> 00:21:22.320]   And Jesus, when He sees them coming, instead of saying, "Good and faithful servant, man,
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.000]   you guys went through all of that and grabbed your children and sought after me and you're
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:27.760]   hungry, let me feed you."
[00:21:27.760 --> 00:21:34.680]   Again, instead, Jesus corrects them in verse 26, "He answered them and said, 'Truly, truly,
[00:21:34.680 --> 00:21:40.560]   I say to you, you seek me not because you saw signs, but because you ate of the loaves
[00:21:40.560 --> 00:21:41.560]   and were filled.'"
[00:21:41.560 --> 00:21:46.160]   In other words, your faith is defective.
[00:21:46.160 --> 00:21:52.160]   You're coming to me because you ate, not because you saw the signs.
[00:21:52.160 --> 00:21:54.280]   You see what He's doing here?
[00:21:54.280 --> 00:21:57.160]   Because in the previous verse, in verse 14, it says, "They were coming to Him because
[00:21:57.160 --> 00:21:58.160]   they saw the sign."
[00:21:58.160 --> 00:22:03.240]   Jesus says, "You're not coming to me because you saw the sign.
[00:22:03.240 --> 00:22:06.320]   You're coming to me because you ate bread."
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:07.320]   Which is it?
[00:22:07.320 --> 00:22:10.740]   It seems like a contradiction, right?
[00:22:10.740 --> 00:22:14.480]   The difference between what they were doing, what Jesus was saying that they weren't doing
[00:22:14.480 --> 00:22:20.520]   was they saw the sign as their final destination.
[00:22:20.520 --> 00:22:28.000]   Because the sign is there for the purpose of pointing to where you ought to go.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:34.880]   So if you're driving on the road and the sign says, "To LA, 28 miles," you don't stop at
[00:22:34.880 --> 00:22:36.720]   that sign and say, "We've made it."
[00:22:36.720 --> 00:22:41.040]   Because the sign only points to where you're supposed to go.
[00:22:41.040 --> 00:22:46.960]   So every miracle that Jesus performed, ultimately, was performed for the purpose of pointing
[00:22:46.960 --> 00:22:50.440]   to Christ, to lead them to Christ.
[00:22:50.440 --> 00:22:55.200]   They saw the sign, they stopped at the sign because the sign was delicious.
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:23:01.360]   In other words, He's saying, "You came to me because you ate," not because you're following
[00:23:01.360 --> 00:23:06.600]   what the sign points to.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:14.560]   We have to be careful that Jesus doesn't simply become the means to whatever goal that we
[00:23:14.560 --> 00:23:17.400]   have established in life.
[00:23:17.400 --> 00:23:23.640]   And this is where, as evangelical conservative Christians, we will look at the health and
[00:23:23.640 --> 00:23:26.960]   wealth gospel and say, "These guys are teaching false doctrines.
[00:23:26.960 --> 00:23:28.840]   It is not the gospel of Christ.
[00:23:28.840 --> 00:23:33.560]   And we make fun of them and it's easy to identify because the kind of cars that they drive and
[00:23:33.560 --> 00:23:36.480]   the money that they make."
[00:23:36.480 --> 00:23:44.720]   But this temptation to see Christ simply as a means, not as the end goal, is a temptation
[00:23:44.720 --> 00:23:50.800]   that you and I all struggle with, every single one of us.
[00:23:50.800 --> 00:23:57.720]   Before we harp on these 5,000 people or 20,000 people, understand what Jesus is saying.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.600]   Understand where they're coming from.
[00:24:00.600 --> 00:24:04.320]   You and I, most of us, have not really faced hunger.
[00:24:04.320 --> 00:24:09.240]   Some of you guys who came from, you know, maybe a war-torn country, maybe your parents
[00:24:09.240 --> 00:24:11.480]   or grandparents came from, maybe they understand.
[00:24:11.480 --> 00:24:15.880]   You and I who are, most of you are born and raised in the United States, I mean, you are
[00:24:15.880 --> 00:24:20.480]   hungry just because you forgot to eat.
[00:24:20.480 --> 00:24:26.840]   Or you're hungry because you ate too much before and you're trying to lose some weight.
[00:24:26.840 --> 00:24:32.040]   Or you're just hungry because you didn't have an opportunity because you were busy.
[00:24:32.040 --> 00:24:37.640]   But have you ever really been hungry because you had no access to food and you didn't know
[00:24:37.640 --> 00:24:41.960]   where the next meal was going to come from?
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:48.400]   Anybody who's raising children right now, at least that I know of, you know, our difficulties,
[00:24:48.400 --> 00:24:53.720]   you know, when our children are younger is how do we get them to eat this food?
[00:24:53.720 --> 00:24:55.800]   So we have to trick them, play games with them.
[00:24:55.800 --> 00:24:59.200]   The airplane's coming or your brother's going to eat it all.
[00:24:59.200 --> 00:25:03.320]   So the struggle that we have isn't necessarily hunger, it's how do we get this stuff into
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   you?
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:09.640]   And a lot of these people who are following Christ was not in that situation.
[00:25:09.640 --> 00:25:10.640]   It was not in abundance.
[00:25:10.640 --> 00:25:14.720]   It wasn't because the bread that Jesus made was so delicious.
[00:25:14.720 --> 00:25:18.760]   You know, it wasn't simply because it was Italian bread that they've never had before
[00:25:18.760 --> 00:25:22.880]   and, you know, butter was so delicious, you know, because the Son of God made it so it
[00:25:22.880 --> 00:25:24.200]   must be the perfect bread.
[00:25:24.200 --> 00:25:28.880]   And, you know, instead of the, you know, the flat bread that they're used to eating that
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:33.920]   the Jewish community ate, this was actually very fluffy and delicious.
[00:25:33.920 --> 00:25:38.320]   Many of them was for their own sustenance.
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:44.840]   You know, when they came to hear Jesus and they were sitting there listening to Him and
[00:25:44.840 --> 00:25:48.400]   they said, "These people have nothing to eat."
[00:25:48.400 --> 00:25:53.280]   Some of them, I think, came to Christ, maybe forgot.
[00:25:53.280 --> 00:25:56.840]   But do you think that maybe many of them were there listening to Him because they didn't
[00:25:56.840 --> 00:25:58.400]   have access to food?
[00:25:58.400 --> 00:26:01.960]   I mean, think about it.
[00:26:01.960 --> 00:26:08.920]   How many of you parents would be so enamored with anything if your kids were hungry?
[00:26:08.920 --> 00:26:10.880]   I think many of them were actually hungry.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.800]   Many of them were probably very poor.
[00:26:13.800 --> 00:26:20.060]   So understandable that they were chasing after Christ because that's where food is.
[00:26:20.060 --> 00:26:24.760]   So He's not talking about abundance and, you know, which store you're going to go to and
[00:26:24.760 --> 00:26:27.640]   Jesus happens to be the best of the stores.
[00:26:27.640 --> 00:26:32.800]   He's talking about eating and living and dying.
[00:26:32.800 --> 00:26:37.680]   So before we harp on these 5,000 people, understand the situation that they're in.
[00:26:37.680 --> 00:26:40.200]   Of course, if you're hungry, you're going to be looking for food.
[00:26:40.200 --> 00:26:44.320]   I mean, if you're really hungry, nothing matters.
[00:26:44.320 --> 00:26:49.120]   And so many of them in that context were coming to Christ because they need to eat, they need
[00:26:49.120 --> 00:26:53.000]   to feed their kids.
[00:26:53.000 --> 00:26:58.960]   So on the surface, what Jesus is saying seems very insensitive.
[00:26:58.960 --> 00:27:00.640]   You're coming to me not because you saw signs.
[00:27:00.640 --> 00:27:07.040]   You're not coming to me because you're coming to me because you want food.
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:11.520]   So understand the gravity of what Jesus is saying.
[00:27:11.520 --> 00:27:19.720]   He is saying that you're coming to me to eat food, but your faith is defective.
[00:27:19.720 --> 00:27:22.680]   And the text that we're looking at, it kind of shows.
[00:27:22.680 --> 00:27:24.920]   It says that they saw the sign, they were coming to Him.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:28.080]   They wanted to force Jesus to be king.
[00:27:28.080 --> 00:27:30.080]   Force Him to be king.
[00:27:30.080 --> 00:27:35.680]   Now, that in and of itself is an oxymoron because a king is somebody that forces you
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:37.880]   to do things.
[00:27:37.880 --> 00:27:39.600]   You don't force somebody to be king.
[00:27:39.600 --> 00:27:43.960]   If you force somebody to be king, then you are the king.
[00:27:43.960 --> 00:27:46.960]   The king is the one that we submit to.
[00:27:46.960 --> 00:27:49.000]   But these people were so desperate.
[00:27:49.000 --> 00:27:51.440]   He has to be our king.
[00:27:51.440 --> 00:27:52.960]   Why does He have to be our king?
[00:27:52.960 --> 00:27:58.280]   Even if we have to force Him to be our king, why does He have to be my king?
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.400]   Because if He's my king, He's going to feed me.
[00:28:02.400 --> 00:28:06.300]   If He's my king, He's going to heal me.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:11.460]   If He's my king, He's going to restore our nation to its pride.
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:14.240]   And I have to have that.
[00:28:14.240 --> 00:28:19.840]   And the only person that we can see in the horizon that can possibly give me this is
[00:28:19.840 --> 00:28:22.640]   Jesus.
[00:28:22.640 --> 00:28:26.520]   That's why they were trying to force Him to be king.
[00:28:26.520 --> 00:28:33.080]   You know, oftentimes we talk about lordship of Christ.
[00:28:33.080 --> 00:28:38.420]   You know, a lot of times I recognize this even in my own heart.
[00:28:38.420 --> 00:28:44.700]   Lordship of Christ, oftentimes in our lives, if we're not careful, is forcing Christ to
[00:28:44.700 --> 00:28:47.500]   do what we want.
[00:28:47.500 --> 00:28:52.340]   Maybe if we establish Him as king, He'll get me a good job.
[00:28:52.340 --> 00:28:58.140]   Maybe if we establish Him as our Lord, He'll keep me safe.
[00:28:58.140 --> 00:29:03.100]   Maybe if we establish Him as king, He's going to make this virus go away.
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:07.320]   Maybe if we worship Him, that our children are going to be healthy, that they're going
[00:29:07.320 --> 00:29:14.740]   to grow up to marry somebody godly, and they're going to have a great life.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:20.620]   It may seem innocuous, but at the core of what Jesus is pointing out in their defective
[00:29:20.620 --> 00:29:25.980]   faith is no different than that.
[00:29:25.980 --> 00:29:29.020]   Because it is important to us.
[00:29:29.020 --> 00:29:30.100]   Because it is essential to us.
[00:29:30.100 --> 00:29:37.760]   For them, if they don't eat, they're going to starve to death.
[00:29:37.760 --> 00:29:40.360]   Who wouldn't want a king like that?
[00:29:40.360 --> 00:29:47.240]   And so, if we're not careful, every single one of us can be tempted to make Jesus the
[00:29:47.240 --> 00:29:50.680]   means to our goal.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:55.360]   And we have to carefully examine ourselves as we are studying the I Am Statements.
[00:29:55.360 --> 00:29:59.000]   Is Jesus our destination?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:04.820]   If Jesus is our destination, then this virus is also a means to get there.
[00:30:04.820 --> 00:30:11.560]   If Jesus is our destination, sometimes suffering is the means that God uses to get us there.
[00:30:11.560 --> 00:30:16.480]   But if Jesus is the means, then He's the means that we use to get to safety.
[00:30:16.480 --> 00:30:19.040]   He's the means that we use to get to feeding.
[00:30:19.040 --> 00:30:22.120]   He's the means that we use to get health.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:29.240]   And that is at the core of the defect that Jesus is pointing out.
[00:30:29.240 --> 00:30:33.420]   The whole reason why He fed them, the whole reason why He healed them, the whole reason
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:39.080]   why He doesn't feed them, the whole reason why He doesn't heal them is to get them to
[00:30:39.080 --> 00:30:43.080]   see Christ as the I Am.
[00:30:43.080 --> 00:30:45.980]   He is.
[00:30:45.980 --> 00:30:56.680]   Is this virus causing us to come to Him and seeing Him as the ultimate treasure?
[00:30:56.680 --> 00:31:02.440]   Jesus says to them in verse 27, "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food
[00:31:02.440 --> 00:31:05.940]   which endures to eternal life.
[00:31:05.940 --> 00:31:10.600]   With the Son of Man, we'll give to you, for on Him the Father God has set His seal."
[00:31:10.600 --> 00:31:15.520]   So He's pointing out to them that you're seeking after this, but there's something more important
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:16.560]   than your food.
[00:31:16.560 --> 00:31:18.680]   There's something more important than your earthly life.
[00:31:18.680 --> 00:31:21.240]   It is your eternal life to seek these things.
[00:31:21.240 --> 00:31:26.920]   And then John 6, 28-29, they respond, "Therefore they said to Him, 'What shall we do so that
[00:31:26.920 --> 00:31:30.200]   we may work the works of God?'"
[00:31:30.200 --> 00:31:35.120]   If we want eternal life and temporal life, of course we want the eternal life.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:37.280]   What do we need to do to get this food?
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:43.200]   "Jesus answered and said to them, 'This is the work of God, that you believe in Him whom
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:46.520]   He has sent.'"
[00:31:46.520 --> 00:31:50.920]   When you read that superficially, it's like, "Oh, easy.
[00:31:50.920 --> 00:31:53.680]   Okay, I believe."
[00:31:53.680 --> 00:32:00.040]   See, if He said, "Go read your Bible," I mean, they probably would have all run and done
[00:32:00.040 --> 00:32:01.040]   that.
[00:32:01.040 --> 00:32:06.520]   If He said, "Run around this lake 10 times," or if I run around this lake 10 times, even
[00:32:06.520 --> 00:32:11.960]   with small children strapped around them, that's going to lead to eternal life?
[00:32:11.960 --> 00:32:16.880]   They probably would have done it because they're talking about their life.
[00:32:16.880 --> 00:32:25.000]   But what Jesus tells them to do, they can't simply do on their own until God has opened
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.920]   their eyes.
[00:32:29.920 --> 00:32:32.680]   So they're asking Jesus, "Well, what can I do?"
[00:32:32.680 --> 00:32:39.760]   Really, the question behind that, the question behind legalism or workspace righteousness,
[00:32:39.760 --> 00:32:43.760]   why it's so offensive to God.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:50.040]   Because workspace righteousness is basically bartering, bartering eternal life with what
[00:32:50.040 --> 00:32:52.440]   we can give.
[00:32:52.440 --> 00:32:54.040]   And again, let me give you an illustration.
[00:32:54.040 --> 00:32:59.320]   If you're a parent, and even if you're not a parent, I think you can understand this.
[00:32:59.320 --> 00:33:05.440]   If a child that you've raised all your life, right, they become an adult, get a full-time
[00:33:05.440 --> 00:33:10.920]   job, and all of a sudden, he wants to become independent, and he doesn't like you telling
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:13.440]   him what to do, or her, you know, "Don't tell me what to do.
[00:33:13.440 --> 00:33:15.760]   I'm an adult, and I have my own paycheck."
[00:33:15.760 --> 00:33:23.680]   And so he comes to you and says, "I'm making a lot of money now, you know, and I know you
[00:33:23.680 --> 00:33:24.800]   invested a lot of money.
[00:33:24.800 --> 00:33:32.280]   How much is it going to cost to be equal?
[00:33:32.280 --> 00:33:33.280]   You spent a lot of money.
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:39.160]   Let's say you spent $5,000 a year, you know, I live 20-some years of my life, and you calculated
[00:33:39.160 --> 00:33:40.160]   all that.
[00:33:40.160 --> 00:33:41.160]   How about if I give you $200,000?"
[00:33:41.160 --> 00:33:42.160]   Okay, don't be offended.
[00:33:42.160 --> 00:33:45.880]   Maybe $200,000 isn't enough.
[00:33:45.880 --> 00:33:48.040]   What about a million dollars?
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:55.280]   What if I gave you a million dollars, would that be enough to say, "Okay, we're equal"?
[00:33:55.280 --> 00:33:58.160]   Okay, okay, a million dollars, now you're offended.
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:00.040]   Clearly you're offended, right?
[00:34:00.040 --> 00:34:01.600]   How about $10 million?
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:04.840]   If I gave you $10 million, would it be equal?
[00:34:04.840 --> 00:34:12.480]   All the work that you put in to raise me, $10 million would be equal.
[00:34:12.480 --> 00:34:14.920]   Maybe the child is a billionaire.
[00:34:14.920 --> 00:34:18.800]   $10 million, all I mean to you is $10 million?
[00:34:18.800 --> 00:34:19.800]   How about a billion?
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:23.640]   How about if I give half of what I have?
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:28.880]   Would that pay for the labor that you put in?
[00:34:28.880 --> 00:34:35.960]   There is no amount that a child can say and barter with his parents with the sacrifice
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:41.040]   that the parent made to raise that child and say, "If you give me this amount," because
[00:34:41.040 --> 00:34:44.760]   it was never done because of money.
[00:34:44.760 --> 00:34:50.480]   There is no amount that you could pay to barter with God and say, "How much can I give to
[00:34:50.480 --> 00:34:51.480]   you?
[00:34:51.480 --> 00:34:55.760]   How hard can I work so that I can gain this eternal life?"
[00:34:55.760 --> 00:35:01.880]   God sent his only begotten son to take our place for our sins.
[00:35:01.880 --> 00:35:07.560]   So for any human being to come before God trying to barter with God and saying, "What
[00:35:07.560 --> 00:35:15.960]   do I have to do to get this eternal life?" is really asking the question, "How much is
[00:35:15.960 --> 00:35:20.200]   Jesus' sacrifice worth?
[00:35:20.200 --> 00:35:21.200]   What is it worth?
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:23.680]   What can I possibly give?"
[00:35:23.680 --> 00:35:30.080]   And that's why Jesus says the only way, only way that we can receive this if we humble
[00:35:30.080 --> 00:35:36.440]   ourselves and we recognize what God has done.
[00:35:36.440 --> 00:35:42.300]   And we come as beggars to the throne of His grace.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:48.320]   And every single one of us, whether you lived righteous lives or unrighteous lives, whether
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.080]   you've been doing drugs all your life, or whether you were a good Sunday school child
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:59.120]   all your life, every single one of us comes before the throne of God humbled.
[00:35:59.120 --> 00:36:03.600]   This virus has humbled every single one of us.
[00:36:03.600 --> 00:36:06.160]   Every single one of us are vulnerable.
[00:36:06.160 --> 00:36:07.160]   Every single one of us.
[00:36:07.160 --> 00:36:15.480]   It is only a glimpse of the reality of the spiritual state that all mankind are under.
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:19.320]   So when we come before God, "What can I do?
[00:36:19.320 --> 00:36:23.000]   What can I do so that this virus doesn't affect me?"
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:27.440]   Well, if you protect yourself, wear glasses, and don't go out, and you can do all of
[00:36:27.440 --> 00:36:32.960]   this stuff, and it can minimize it, but you can do all of that stuff.
[00:36:32.960 --> 00:36:35.280]   Right now there is no cure.
[00:36:35.280 --> 00:36:41.120]   And there is no cure for our sins outside of Christ.
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:42.920]   And that's why He says, "You must believe."
[00:36:42.920 --> 00:36:44.640]   And He says it repeatedly over again.
[00:36:44.640 --> 00:36:46.160]   In verse 29, "You must believe."
[00:36:46.160 --> 00:36:47.760]   Verse 35, "You must believe."
[00:36:47.760 --> 00:36:49.960]   And verse 47, "You must believe."
[00:36:49.960 --> 00:36:54.520]   And verse 69, "Because they believed."
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:58.080]   Well, their response, I mean, they're dense.
[00:36:58.080 --> 00:36:59.080]   They're really dense.
[00:36:59.080 --> 00:37:02.840]   In verse 31, "Our fathers ate manna in the wilderness, and as it is written, 'He gave
[00:37:02.840 --> 00:37:04.640]   them bread out of heaven to eat.'"
[00:37:04.640 --> 00:37:08.640]   If you want us to believe you, what does He say?
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:09.640]   Give us some bread.
[00:37:09.640 --> 00:37:11.920]   It's almost comical.
[00:37:11.920 --> 00:37:12.920]   Right?
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:19.880]   Again, many of you are raising children who are very strong-willed, you know, and you
[00:37:19.880 --> 00:37:22.160]   know what I'm talking about, right?
[00:37:22.160 --> 00:37:26.960]   Once they get their mind set on something, I have a child in my house like that too.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.200]   What's up?
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:33.800]   Once they get their mind on something, they just can't let go.
[00:37:33.800 --> 00:37:37.800]   I mean, these guys, I mean, they wanted food.
[00:37:37.800 --> 00:37:39.480]   Jesus says, "You must believe."
[00:37:39.480 --> 00:37:41.920]   And He said, "Well, if you want me to believe, give us some food."
[00:37:41.920 --> 00:37:47.520]   So the Jews believed that when the Messiah comes, He was going to recreate that miracle
[00:37:47.520 --> 00:37:48.520]   of the manna.
[00:37:48.520 --> 00:37:54.920]   You know, as God fed the Israelites in the desert, He said that the Messiah was going
[00:37:54.920 --> 00:37:56.560]   to come and He was going to perform that miracle.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:38:02.600]   And He said, "If you really want us to believe and you're that manna from heaven, give us
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:03.600]   some bread."
[00:38:03.600 --> 00:38:04.600]   And it is in this.
[00:38:04.600 --> 00:38:08.480]   And can you imagine the frustration of Jesus when He says this to them?
[00:38:08.480 --> 00:38:12.920]   And if you don't read it in the context, you just kind of read it as like Jesus's glorious
[00:38:12.920 --> 00:38:14.520]   statement, "I am the bread of life."
[00:38:14.520 --> 00:38:20.760]   But if you read it in context of the conversation that He's having, my guess is, "I am the bread
[00:38:20.760 --> 00:38:21.760]   of life!"
[00:38:21.760 --> 00:38:22.760]   I'm guessing.
[00:38:22.760 --> 00:38:25.480]   I don't know what kind of personality He had.
[00:38:25.480 --> 00:38:30.240]   If He had my kind of personality, He probably would have been, "What have I been telling
[00:38:30.240 --> 00:38:31.240]   you?
[00:38:31.240 --> 00:38:35.960]   I mean, two and a half years, I've been telling you.
[00:38:35.960 --> 00:38:40.080]   Now it's just, I mean, I made it crystal clear.
[00:38:40.080 --> 00:38:42.440]   You're coming to me because you want bread.
[00:38:42.440 --> 00:38:43.440]   You don't know."
[00:38:43.440 --> 00:38:46.040]   Hey, all of that was to point to me.
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:48.840]   If you want eternal life, you have to come to me.
[00:38:48.840 --> 00:38:53.440]   Well, if you want us to believe in you, give us some bread.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:56.000]   I am the bread of life.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:58.960]   And He says this repeatedly over and over.
[00:38:58.960 --> 00:39:02.480]   Can you imagine the fourth or fifth time He had to say this?
[00:39:02.480 --> 00:39:05.760]   What kind of tone that He must have had?
[00:39:05.760 --> 00:39:08.080]   I know some people who are very patient.
[00:39:08.080 --> 00:39:10.280]   I'm not one of those people.
[00:39:10.280 --> 00:39:13.480]   Pastor Mark is a very patient man.
[00:39:13.480 --> 00:39:16.880]   Sometimes I'm amazed how patient he can be.
[00:39:16.880 --> 00:39:20.280]   But he has his limits.
[00:39:20.280 --> 00:39:24.760]   You push him to a point where he said, "Yes, yes, yes, yes."
[00:39:24.760 --> 00:39:33.760]   And I can tell when he's frustrated because he doesn't yell like normal people.
[00:39:33.760 --> 00:39:36.160]   You can see him quivering.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:40.760]   And I know, it'll come out, "I am the bread of life."
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:43.400]   But I can see him quivering.
[00:39:43.400 --> 00:39:44.680]   Maybe Jesus was like that.
[00:39:44.680 --> 00:39:46.400]   He's a lot more controlled.
[00:39:46.400 --> 00:39:53.200]   My guess is, looking at what He did at the temple, right, that Jesus probably had some
[00:39:53.200 --> 00:39:55.200]   fire in Him too.
[00:39:55.200 --> 00:39:57.960]   You know, my guess is by the time He said it a fourth or fifth time, like, "You just
[00:39:57.960 --> 00:39:59.920]   don't get it.
[00:39:59.920 --> 00:40:05.240]   I am the bread of life which comes down from heaven."
[00:40:05.240 --> 00:40:09.800]   That's how I read it in context, in verse 35.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:14.920]   All the hungering and the thirsting are simply symptoms.
[00:40:14.920 --> 00:40:22.520]   Jesus says, "He who comes to me will not hunger, and he who believes in me will never thirst."
[00:40:22.520 --> 00:40:32.840]   Suffering, ultimately our death, are all only symptoms of the real problem, our sins.
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:37.760]   Jesus is the only antibody who has not been affected by sin.
[00:40:37.760 --> 00:40:43.040]   It is only His blood that can cure our disease.
[00:40:43.040 --> 00:40:46.520]   Am I milking that?
[00:40:46.520 --> 00:40:47.520]   No.
[00:40:47.520 --> 00:40:48.520]   It's a perfect illustration.
[00:40:48.520 --> 00:40:49.520]   It's a perfect parallel.
[00:40:49.520 --> 00:40:52.680]   It's a perfect parallel.
[00:40:52.680 --> 00:40:56.960]   They accepted Him as prophet, but they could not accept Him as God in verse, chapter 6,
[00:40:56.960 --> 00:40:57.960]   41 to 42.
[00:40:57.960 --> 00:41:01.400]   "Therefore, the Jews were grumbling about Him because He said, 'I am the bread that
[00:41:01.400 --> 00:41:03.000]   came down out of heaven.'"
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:06.720]   They were saying, "Is not this Jesus, the son of Joseph, whose father and mother we
[00:41:06.720 --> 00:41:07.720]   know?
[00:41:07.720 --> 00:41:12.800]   How does He now say, 'I have come down out of heaven'?"
[00:41:12.800 --> 00:41:16.040]   You know, if you look at the account of the gospels, the very first place that Jesus is
[00:41:16.040 --> 00:41:20.240]   rejected is in Galilee, His hometown.
[00:41:20.240 --> 00:41:26.480]   We know His father, His brother, His mother, how can He be different than us?
[00:41:26.480 --> 00:41:29.920]   And Jesus says, "A prophet is not honored in his hometown," and that's exactly what's
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:30.920]   going on.
[00:41:30.920 --> 00:41:31.920]   We knew Him.
[00:41:31.920 --> 00:41:32.920]   He was too intimate.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:36.880]   Now, all of us, we didn't see Jesus growing up.
[00:41:36.880 --> 00:41:40.200]   We don't know the intimate details of His childhood, so maybe it's easier for us to
[00:41:40.200 --> 00:41:42.680]   see Him as God.
[00:41:42.680 --> 00:41:49.560]   But the longer that we've been a Christian, the longer we've heard the gospel, the longer
[00:41:49.560 --> 00:41:55.220]   that we've been raised at church, it has the same effect on us.
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:42:03.360]   Even though we say He is God, even though we say He is I Am, when He becomes so familiar
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:11.120]   that He doesn't sound any different than one of us, then we no longer run to Him.
[00:42:11.120 --> 00:42:15.400]   In Romans 6, 48-51, He says again, "I am the bread of life.
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:20.080]   Your fathers ate the manna in the wilderness, and they died."
[00:42:20.080 --> 00:42:21.080]   Don't just read that over.
[00:42:21.080 --> 00:42:25.800]   He says, "You're looking for manna that your father ate, and you want to eat again.
[00:42:25.800 --> 00:42:29.300]   You're waiting for the manna to come down to sustain you and your children.
[00:42:29.300 --> 00:42:34.140]   But remember, at the end of all of that, they all died.
[00:42:34.140 --> 00:42:38.580]   And this is the bread which comes down out of heaven, so that one may eat of it and not
[00:42:38.580 --> 00:42:40.780]   die."
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:46.160]   So the bread that He's talking about and the bread that you want, the difference is death
[00:42:46.160 --> 00:42:47.160]   and life.
[00:42:47.160 --> 00:42:51.700]   It is not good bread versus better bread.
[00:42:51.700 --> 00:42:53.720]   He says it's life and death, 51.
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:57.600]   "I am the living bread that came down out of heaven.
[00:42:57.600 --> 00:43:00.380]   If anyone eats of this bread, he will live forever.
[00:43:00.380 --> 00:43:07.520]   And the bread also which I am, I will give for the life of the world is my flesh."
[00:43:07.520 --> 00:43:12.240]   Everything that He did was to bring them to this point.
[00:43:12.240 --> 00:43:21.080]   See, he who eats the bread of Christ, He says he will never die.
[00:43:21.080 --> 00:43:24.600]   Right now, the whole world is afraid of dying.
[00:43:24.600 --> 00:43:28.400]   And that's the fundamental difference between a Christian and a non-Christian.
[00:43:28.400 --> 00:43:35.400]   Because our death, our death has been purchased by the blood of Christ.
[00:43:35.400 --> 00:43:41.000]   He who eats of His flesh and drinks of His blood, He says shall never die.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:45.520]   Not because He will protect us from the virus, not because we will have enough food to eat
[00:43:45.520 --> 00:43:51.440]   until we retire, but it says this eternal separation that causes this eternal death
[00:43:51.440 --> 00:43:56.900]   away from the author of life, He said you will never die.
[00:43:56.900 --> 00:44:01.040]   Jesus did not simply come to feed us.
[00:44:01.040 --> 00:44:04.440]   He didn't simply come to heal us.
[00:44:04.440 --> 00:44:07.800]   He didn't simply come to protect us.
[00:44:07.800 --> 00:44:12.040]   He came so that we may have life and have this life abundantly.
[00:44:12.040 --> 00:44:16.800]   And that's what He says in verse 40, "For this is the will of my Father."
[00:44:16.800 --> 00:44:19.620]   How many of us are wrestling right now?
[00:44:19.620 --> 00:44:22.160]   Is it God's will to date this person or not date this person?
[00:44:22.160 --> 00:44:24.240]   Is it God's will for me to go to this school or that school?
[00:44:24.240 --> 00:44:26.840]   Is it God's will for me to get this job or that job?
[00:44:26.840 --> 00:44:32.680]   Is it God's will for me to get this job, buy this house at this time?
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:42.800]   But He says clearly, "This is my Father's will, that we recognize Christ as I am.
[00:44:42.800 --> 00:44:48.560]   That everyone who beholds a son and believes in Him will have eternal life and I myself
[00:44:48.560 --> 00:44:52.320]   will raise Him up on the last day."
[00:44:52.320 --> 00:44:57.160]   Again in 52 to verse 53, He's talking to people who just will not get it.
[00:44:57.160 --> 00:45:04.880]   So after about four or five times saying like, "I am, I am, I am, I am," and He finally says
[00:45:04.880 --> 00:45:10.160]   to them, verse 52, "And the Jews began to argue with one another saying, 'How can this
[00:45:10.160 --> 00:45:12.600]   man give us his flesh to eat?'
[00:45:12.600 --> 00:45:16.720]   So that Jesus said to them, 'Truly I say to you, unless you eat of the flesh and the
[00:45:16.720 --> 00:45:21.600]   Son of Man and drink His blood, you have no life in yourselves.'"
[00:45:21.600 --> 00:45:26.240]   Now think how shocking that statement is to a Jew, to anybody.
[00:45:26.240 --> 00:45:31.160]   Even to us today, like eat His flesh, drink His blood?
[00:45:31.160 --> 00:45:35.080]   There is nothing more sacrilegious.
[00:45:35.080 --> 00:45:40.360]   There's nothing more sacrilegious to anybody, but in particular a Jew, because they weren't
[00:45:40.360 --> 00:45:44.920]   allowed to drink even the blood of the animals.
[00:45:44.920 --> 00:45:47.280]   Remember that when we started the book of Leviticus?
[00:45:47.280 --> 00:45:51.040]   If they came in contact with somebody who was dead, what happened?
[00:45:51.040 --> 00:45:52.040]   They would become unclean.
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:46:00.160]   And they would have to be quarantined for a length of time, just in case.
[00:46:00.160 --> 00:46:03.560]   But Jesus tells them, "Not only do you have to come draw near to me," He said, "you have
[00:46:03.560 --> 00:46:05.280]   to eat my flesh and drink my blood."
[00:46:05.280 --> 00:46:07.640]   And He never explains Himself.
[00:46:07.640 --> 00:46:14.640]   Again, if you read that out of context, it's like, "Wow, like who wouldn't turn away from
[00:46:14.640 --> 00:46:16.600]   Jesus?"
[00:46:16.600 --> 00:46:20.240]   He was talking to a group of people who was just hardened, and Jesus, they just would
[00:46:20.240 --> 00:46:24.280]   not believe, and they were committed to their unbelief.
[00:46:24.280 --> 00:46:27.520]   He doesn't even explain Himself to them.
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:32.800]   If you don't eat my flesh and drink my blood, you cannot have eternal life.
[00:46:32.800 --> 00:46:40.840]   And it is at that 66, as a result of these statements, many of them no longer follow
[00:46:40.840 --> 00:46:43.440]   Jesus.
[00:46:43.440 --> 00:46:48.640]   This is what caused them to turn, as a result of this.
[00:46:48.640 --> 00:46:55.560]   See, this, this that He's talking about, is the distinction between Christian and non-Christian,
[00:46:55.560 --> 00:46:59.880]   is the distinction between wheat and the tares, is the distinction between somebody who comes
[00:46:59.880 --> 00:47:05.160]   to church all of his life, declaring and worshiping and singing the same song, studying the same
[00:47:05.160 --> 00:47:11.680]   Bible, but only sees Jesus as a means to whatever goal that they have established in life, and
[00:47:11.680 --> 00:47:15.160]   their goal is no different than the world.
[00:47:15.160 --> 00:47:23.400]   It just, they just found that Jesus is the better means than just making money.
[00:47:23.400 --> 00:47:33.400]   This is what distinguishes between those who go to heaven and those who are judged in eternity.
[00:47:33.400 --> 00:47:38.700]   Because they would not receive Christ, they turned away.
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:44.440]   How many people in the church turned away from Christ, this Christ of the Bible, but
[00:47:44.440 --> 00:47:47.320]   have never turned away from the church?
[00:47:47.320 --> 00:47:54.400]   See, we need to be sober, not simply sober so that we can protect ourselves and get back
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.480]   to what is normal.
[00:47:57.480 --> 00:48:00.360]   And that's a statement that we hear all the time, "What is normal?
[00:48:00.360 --> 00:48:03.360]   What is normal for a Christian?
[00:48:03.360 --> 00:48:08.200]   Was the life that you and I were living before this happened, was that normal?"
[00:48:08.200 --> 00:48:14.600]   Like, pursuing things, making money, getting married, having children, for a Christian,
[00:48:14.600 --> 00:48:15.600]   is that normal?
[00:48:15.600 --> 00:48:16.600]   No.
[00:48:16.600 --> 00:48:19.600]   That's not, that wasn't normal.
[00:48:19.600 --> 00:48:24.320]   A lot of the things that God broke in our lives were not normal.
[00:48:24.320 --> 00:48:27.520]   It was not consistent with what the Bible taught.
[00:48:27.520 --> 00:48:33.960]   It was not consistent with people who claim to have Christ as hope, their eternal hope.
[00:48:33.960 --> 00:48:35.720]   It was not consistent.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:41.160]   Really what God is doing in our lives is to shake up what we were holding on to that was
[00:48:41.160 --> 00:48:52.160]   so normal, and to start something new in Christ, not just individually, but maybe as a church.
[00:48:52.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   You know, this is forcing us to evaluate everything that we're doing as a church.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:01.120]   What is normal?
[00:49:01.120 --> 00:49:02.120]   What is essential?
[00:49:02.120 --> 00:49:09.440]   I remember when Governor Gavin said that, right, "All non-essentials to be shut down."
[00:49:09.440 --> 00:49:10.440]   What is non-essential?
[00:49:10.440 --> 00:49:11.440]   Is your faith non-essential?
[00:49:11.440 --> 00:49:14.840]   Is the church non-essential?
[00:49:14.840 --> 00:49:17.320]   Is your walk with God non-essential?
[00:49:17.320 --> 00:49:18.320]   You need to eat.
[00:49:18.320 --> 00:49:22.680]   You know, the first thing people did, went to the supermarket and they loaded their baskets
[00:49:22.680 --> 00:49:29.280]   with toilet paper, hand sanitizers, and all kinds of food.
[00:49:29.280 --> 00:49:32.560]   But was Christ essential in the part of that?
[00:49:32.560 --> 00:49:38.560]   Is the love of Christ and the pursuit of Christ, was that essential as a part of all of that?
[00:49:38.560 --> 00:49:44.120]   Right now, you hear the statement, "I am praying for you."
[00:49:44.120 --> 00:49:45.120]   I'm praying.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:47.600]   I hear that everywhere on the internet.
[00:49:47.600 --> 00:49:54.440]   People who mock Christians, you know, clearly they don't believe in God.
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:57.680]   And yet that statement, "Oh, my prayers and thoughts."
[00:49:57.680 --> 00:50:02.440]   Christians are praying because they are desperate, because they have nowhere else to turn.
[00:50:02.440 --> 00:50:07.080]   So if there is God, maybe He'll help me because I'm desperate.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:09.480]   If somebody's on their deathbed, who else am I going to turn to?
[00:50:09.480 --> 00:50:13.040]   If doctors did everything that they could and they can't resuscitate the person, my
[00:50:13.040 --> 00:50:17.400]   prayers and thoughts are on you.
[00:50:17.400 --> 00:50:24.440]   Let's be careful that the way that we follow Christ doesn't mimic the world, that we don't
[00:50:24.440 --> 00:50:26.640]   cling to Him when we are desperate.
[00:50:26.640 --> 00:50:35.400]   Then as soon as things go back to normal, that we go right back to our old life.
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:40.280]   Jesus says in John 6, 67 to 69, "So Jesus said to the twelve, after He saw all of them
[00:50:40.280 --> 00:50:44.000]   turn away, 'You do not want to go away also, do you?'
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:46.640]   Simon Peter answered Him, 'Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:50:46.640 --> 00:50:47.920]   You have words of eternal life.
[00:50:47.920 --> 00:50:52.920]   We have believed and have come to know that You are the Holy One of God.'"
[00:50:52.920 --> 00:50:59.400]   In other words, they don't really understand fully either.
[00:50:59.400 --> 00:51:03.680]   And it's clear because when Jesus was going to the cross, Jesus said, "I'm going to be
[00:51:03.680 --> 00:51:06.600]   crucified and be raised on the third day."
[00:51:06.600 --> 00:51:08.720]   They were so confused with Jesus going to the cross.
[00:51:08.720 --> 00:51:13.240]   And then even after Jesus was raised, nobody went to the tomb.
[00:51:13.240 --> 00:51:17.160]   The ladies went to the tomb to take care of His body, even though Jesus made it very clear
[00:51:17.160 --> 00:51:19.320]   that this is what He came to do.
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:21.920]   So the disciples really didn't understand either.
[00:51:21.920 --> 00:51:28.480]   But the difference between them and the multitude was, they said, "We believe You.
[00:51:28.480 --> 00:51:29.560]   You have the words of life.
[00:51:29.560 --> 00:51:32.760]   Who else are we going to turn to now?"
[00:51:32.760 --> 00:51:35.640]   There are a lot of times in our life when things just don't make sense.
[00:51:35.640 --> 00:51:38.200]   Maybe there's stuff going on in your life right now.
[00:51:38.200 --> 00:51:40.080]   It just doesn't make sense.
[00:51:40.080 --> 00:51:46.520]   But the difference between somebody who perseveres and somebody who quits is his faith.
[00:51:46.520 --> 00:51:51.440]   Do you believe that the answer is found in Christ?
[00:51:51.440 --> 00:51:52.440]   That was a distinction.
[00:51:52.440 --> 00:51:56.200]   And that's what Paul said in 2 Timothy 1.12, "I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have
[00:51:56.200 --> 00:52:02.600]   believed and I am convinced that He is able to guard until that day what has been entrusted
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:03.600]   to Him."
[00:52:03.600 --> 00:52:08.160]   What did Paul entrust to God?
[00:52:08.160 --> 00:52:09.160]   His reputation?
[00:52:09.160 --> 00:52:12.840]   That is already shot.
[00:52:12.840 --> 00:52:14.720]   His bank account?
[00:52:14.720 --> 00:52:15.720]   Had nothing.
[00:52:15.720 --> 00:52:16.720]   He lost everything.
[00:52:16.720 --> 00:52:17.720]   Citizenship?
[00:52:17.720 --> 00:52:18.720]   Many churches?
[00:52:18.720 --> 00:52:19.720]   No.
[00:52:19.720 --> 00:52:20.720]   Remember, this is 2 Timothy.
[00:52:20.720 --> 00:52:21.720]   He already said his life is being poured out.
[00:52:21.720 --> 00:52:22.720]   I mean, he knows death is coming.
[00:52:22.720 --> 00:52:36.680]   So when he says, "I know whom I have entrusted all things," what did he entrust to God?
[00:52:36.680 --> 00:52:38.200]   His very life.
[00:52:38.200 --> 00:52:40.360]   His soul.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:48.800]   So a man who has entrusted his soul to God is not afraid to die because the most important
[00:52:48.800 --> 00:52:52.260]   thing in my life is in His hands.
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:56.720]   And I know whom I have believed.
[00:52:56.720 --> 00:53:00.240]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:53:00.240 --> 00:53:04.400]   And I know, and I don't want to be insensitive because the suffering is real, right?
[00:53:04.400 --> 00:53:08.840]   And I've already heard people in our church who've lost their jobs.
[00:53:08.840 --> 00:53:12.320]   And I, we're praying for you as often as we can.
[00:53:12.320 --> 00:53:16.800]   The health workers, the doctors and nurses and PTs and the first responders and all of
[00:53:16.800 --> 00:53:17.800]   you guys that are out there.
[00:53:17.800 --> 00:53:24.040]   And I'm watching videos of nurses who are in tears because they're afraid and all of
[00:53:24.040 --> 00:53:25.600]   that stuff is real, right?
[00:53:25.600 --> 00:53:29.280]   And it is not to minimize any of that.
[00:53:29.280 --> 00:53:33.040]   We are praying for you and we're going to keep praying for you that you would have courage
[00:53:33.040 --> 00:53:35.040]   to continue to do what you need to do.
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:41.720]   But we're also going to pray that God would give you the faith that your response is not
[00:53:41.720 --> 00:53:44.240]   like the rest of the world.
[00:53:44.240 --> 00:53:48.160]   That your greatest fear is not that you will suffer.
[00:53:48.160 --> 00:53:53.240]   Your greatest fear is not that you may have a shorter life than maybe you could have had.
[00:53:53.240 --> 00:53:59.200]   But that your greatest fear is that Christ would not be exalted.
[00:53:59.200 --> 00:54:03.960]   That your family and friends who do not know Christ would never confess their faith in
[00:54:03.960 --> 00:54:04.960]   Christ.
[00:54:04.960 --> 00:54:07.760]   That that would be your greatest fear.
[00:54:07.760 --> 00:54:09.880]   That our life is found in Christ and Christ alone.
[00:54:09.880 --> 00:54:17.960]   If Christ came to give us bread, to give us peace, abundance, safety, long life, he could
[00:54:17.960 --> 00:54:22.280]   have done all of that from heaven.
[00:54:22.280 --> 00:54:23.280]   He could have done that.
[00:54:23.280 --> 00:54:27.120]   He created the universe just by his words.
[00:54:27.120 --> 00:54:28.920]   He could have given you a better job from heaven.
[00:54:28.920 --> 00:54:31.840]   He could have given you bread abundant for the rest of your life.
[00:54:31.840 --> 00:54:36.440]   He could have made you billionaires over and over again from heaven.
[00:54:36.440 --> 00:54:42.280]   He wouldn't have had to come down, empty himself of the glory that he was receiving, and become
[00:54:42.280 --> 00:54:48.560]   humbled and to suffer, and then be crucified and resurrected, to be rejected, to be beaten,
[00:54:48.560 --> 00:54:54.960]   to be scorned, just so that we can, less people would be hungry.
[00:54:54.960 --> 00:54:57.080]   He didn't have to come down for that.
[00:54:57.080 --> 00:55:00.840]   He could have easily done that from heaven.
[00:55:00.840 --> 00:55:06.560]   He came and walked among us, humiliated and suffered on our behalf, because the only way
[00:55:06.560 --> 00:55:15.040]   to deal with our sins was for him to absorb it upon his body.
[00:55:15.040 --> 00:55:19.640]   So as this thing continues on, and again, we are praying for you.
[00:55:19.640 --> 00:55:23.360]   We're hoping that it'll be shorter than later.
[00:55:23.360 --> 00:55:26.560]   But I want to ask you a question.
[00:55:26.560 --> 00:55:31.240]   What if they never find a solution to this virus?
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:33.240]   What if this is normal now?
[00:55:33.240 --> 00:55:38.000]   And I don't mean to scare, and I know some of you guys are genuinely concerned, but I
[00:55:38.000 --> 00:55:42.200]   want to post you a real question.
[00:55:42.200 --> 00:55:44.960]   What if they never find a virus?
[00:55:44.960 --> 00:55:52.160]   What if, as they say, some of the people say, that there's 70% of people actually get infected,
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:57.400]   and anywhere between 1% to as high as 20% in some parts of the world.
[00:55:57.400 --> 00:55:58.880]   What if that becomes the norm?
[00:55:58.880 --> 00:56:03.040]   What if, and there are some rumors going around right now, like in China, that they found
[00:56:03.040 --> 00:56:10.960]   another virus, and another 10 people died, and they died from this infection, but it's
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:12.360]   not related to this.
[00:56:12.360 --> 00:56:16.800]   Again, not to freak you out, but this is not fake news.
[00:56:16.800 --> 00:56:17.800]   I'm reading this.
[00:56:17.800 --> 00:56:18.800]   It could have been.
[00:56:18.800 --> 00:56:22.880]   I'm pretty sure that they have that contained, right, because they know the consequence.
[00:56:22.880 --> 00:56:26.320]   What if this is normal?
[00:56:26.320 --> 00:56:30.240]   Will your life be devastated?
[00:56:30.240 --> 00:56:38.160]   It will be if Jesus was just your means, because your goals have been shattered, and maybe
[00:56:38.160 --> 00:56:41.480]   those goals will never come back.
[00:56:41.480 --> 00:56:53.520]   If Christ was our goal, if Christ becomes our goal, all means that gets us to Christ
[00:56:53.520 --> 00:57:01.560]   is a good thing, because Christ and Christ alone can give us eternal life.
[00:57:01.560 --> 00:57:05.960]   I'm going to ask the praise team to come up, and we're going to sing this final song before
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:08.600]   we end our service.
[00:57:08.600 --> 00:57:11.760]   I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold.
[00:57:11.760 --> 00:57:15.520]   I'd rather be his than have riches untold.
[00:57:15.520 --> 00:57:17.760]   I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:23.540]   I'd rather be led by his nail-pierced hand than to be the king of a vast domain or be
[00:57:23.540 --> 00:57:26.120]   held in sin's dread sway.
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:31.840]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[00:57:31.840 --> 00:57:37.560]   As we sing this song, again, I pray that this would become our confession.
[00:57:37.560 --> 00:57:39.640]   Maybe as you're singing this, you say, "You know what?
[00:57:39.640 --> 00:57:40.640]   I'm not being honest.
[00:57:40.640 --> 00:57:43.320]   This is not exactly how I feel."
[00:57:43.320 --> 00:57:47.800]   But as we're singing it, pray to God, "Lord, I believe.
[00:57:47.800 --> 00:57:50.280]   Help my unbelief.
[00:57:50.280 --> 00:57:54.840]   Open my eyes that I may see the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:57:54.840 --> 00:57:56.200]   Christ was not my treasure.
[00:57:56.200 --> 00:58:02.120]   He was not my goal, but then now I want him to be."
[00:58:02.120 --> 00:58:04.360]   So let's sing this song as a confession.
[00:58:04.360 --> 00:58:08.320]   Let's sing this song as a prayer and request that this is what we desire of our lives.
[00:58:08.320 --> 00:58:12.040]   So let me pray for us, and then our worship team will lead us.
[00:58:12.040 --> 00:58:17.720]   Heavenly Father, I pray for our brothers and sisters all around the world.
[00:58:17.720 --> 00:58:22.740]   I pray that this would cause us to see the treasure that we truly have in Christ, that
[00:58:22.740 --> 00:58:28.320]   all that we have ever needed and possibly even wanted is found in Christ and Christ
[00:58:28.320 --> 00:58:29.320]   alone.
[00:58:29.320 --> 00:58:34.320]   And may that truth be even more so now.
[00:58:34.320 --> 00:58:40.640]   So we pray, Father God, that you would lift up our eyes, that our confession will be consistent
[00:58:40.640 --> 00:58:45.640]   with this praise song, that we'd rather have Jesus more than silver or gold, more than
[00:58:45.640 --> 00:58:48.200]   anything that this world can behold.
[00:58:48.200 --> 00:58:51.200]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:58:51.200 --> 00:58:52.200]   Amen.
[00:58:52.200 --> 00:59:15.200]   I'd rather have Jesus than silver or gold.
[00:59:15.200 --> 00:59:22.680]   I'd rather be His than have riches untold.
[00:59:22.680 --> 00:59:30.280]   I'd rather have Jesus than houses or lands.
[00:59:30.280 --> 00:59:46.000]   I'd rather be led by His nail-pierced hands than to be the king of a vast domain or be
[00:59:46.000 --> 00:59:53.200]   held in sin's dread sway.
[00:59:53.200 --> 01:00:19.440]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[01:00:19.440 --> 01:00:30.920]   I'd rather have Jesus than man's applause.
[01:00:30.920 --> 01:00:38.400]   I'd rather be faithful to His dear cause.
[01:00:38.400 --> 01:00:46.000]   I'd rather have Jesus than worldwide fame.
[01:00:46.000 --> 01:01:03.000]   I'd rather be true to His holy name than to be the king of a vast domain or be held in
[01:01:03.000 --> 01:01:08.200]   sin's dread sway.
[01:01:08.200 --> 01:01:22.960]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords today.
[01:01:22.960 --> 01:01:34.760]   I'd rather have Jesus than anything this world affords.
[01:01:34.760 --> 01:01:38.640]   This world affords today.
[01:01:38.640 --> 01:01:49.000]   I want to remind you, we are called.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:02:05.240]   Try to come online as much as we can.
[01:02:05.240 --> 01:02:09.240]   And again, we're going to try to be online to try to connect the church.
[01:02:09.240 --> 01:02:14.400]   And then next Sunday, remember that at one o'clock that we're going to be having a church
[01:02:14.400 --> 01:02:15.400]   information meeting.
[01:02:15.400 --> 01:02:20.280]   And so please try to, you know, make that part of your schedule.
[01:02:20.280 --> 01:02:21.280]   Okay?
[01:02:21.280 --> 01:02:22.280]   Have a great week.
[01:02:22.280 --> 01:02:23.280]   Let's pray.
[01:02:23.280 --> 01:02:29.640]   Gracious and loving Father, we pray, Father God, for the leaders of our country, governors,
[01:02:29.640 --> 01:02:35.440]   mayors, the president, vice president, the doctors who are working with him.
[01:02:35.440 --> 01:02:40.160]   I pray, Father God, that this divided country would come together.
[01:02:40.160 --> 01:02:47.960]   Lord, you know that ultimately the cure is in your hands.
[01:02:47.960 --> 01:02:52.160]   Help us, Lord God, to acknowledge you as sovereign and not simply say it with words but to believe
[01:02:52.160 --> 01:02:54.000]   it in our heart.
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:03:01.440]   Not only sovereign over this world, over our country, over our city, but our very souls.
[01:03:01.440 --> 01:03:08.520]   Help us to confess as Paul did that we know who you are and we know that you are more
[01:03:08.520 --> 01:03:15.680]   than capable of keeping unto the day that we meet you, our very souls.
[01:03:15.680 --> 01:03:21.880]   I pray, Father God, that if we have found our life in trivial things in this world,
[01:03:21.880 --> 01:03:28.960]   that this will be an opportunity for us to reflect whether our health is truly in danger
[01:03:28.960 --> 01:03:33.840]   for our health workers who are in their front line, Lord God, doing their best, Lord, to
[01:03:33.840 --> 01:03:37.080]   manage their anxiety in the midst of serving.
[01:03:37.080 --> 01:03:39.120]   Give them courage beyond themselves, Lord God.
[01:03:39.120 --> 01:03:44.760]   I pray that your word would become much more sweeter than it ever was, that their value
[01:03:44.760 --> 01:03:51.620]   system, Lord God, would be oriented around the foundation of Christ, that our confession
[01:03:51.620 --> 01:03:58.000]   of Jesus as the bread of our life would not simply be a doctrinal statement but the testimony
[01:03:58.000 --> 01:03:59.680]   of our lives.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.760]   Help us be mindful of the people who are around us.
[01:04:02.760 --> 01:04:09.120]   Help us, Lord God, to be a resource for people who are in need, physically, but even more
[01:04:09.120 --> 01:04:11.040]   spiritually.
[01:04:11.040 --> 01:04:13.840]   Let us shine bright, Lord God.
[01:04:13.840 --> 01:04:16.840]   Let us be the salt of this world during this dark time.
[01:04:16.840 --> 01:04:24.360]   And so now, the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship that we truly have in the
[01:04:24.360 --> 01:04:32.880]   Holy Spirit and the love of God our Father, ascent your only begotten Son to suffer on
[01:04:32.880 --> 01:04:37.160]   our behalf to cure us of our disease of sin.
[01:04:37.160 --> 01:04:44.560]   Protect us, reorient us, revive us, that our hope may be placed in Christ and Christ alone.
