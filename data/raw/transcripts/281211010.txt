[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 15, I'll be reading 14 to 21, but
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:15.760]   again, our main focus this morning is going to be 14 to 16.
[00:00:15.760 --> 00:00:22.560]   Romans chapter 15, 14 to 21.
[00:00:22.560 --> 00:00:27.640]   I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers, that you yourselves are full of goodness,
[00:00:27.640 --> 00:00:30.520]   filled with all knowledge, and able to instruct one another.
[00:00:30.520 --> 00:00:33.960]   But on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder, because of the
[00:00:33.960 --> 00:00:38.440]   grace given me by God, to be a minister of Christ Jesus to the Gentiles, to the priestly
[00:00:38.440 --> 00:00:42.480]   service of the gospel of God, so that the offering of the Gentiles may be acceptable,
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:44.720]   sanctified by the Holy Spirit.
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:49.160]   In Christ Jesus, then, I have reason to be proud of my work for God, for I will not venture
[00:00:49.160 --> 00:00:54.640]   to speak anything except what Christ has accomplished through me to bring the Gentiles to obedience,
[00:00:54.640 --> 00:00:56.400]   by word and deed.
[00:00:56.400 --> 00:01:00.400]   By the power of signs and wonders, by the power of the Spirit of God, so that from Jerusalem
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.960]   and all the way around to Iliquium, I have fulfilled the ministry of the gospel of Christ,
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:09.240]   and thus I make it my ambition to preach the gospel, not where Christ has already been
[00:01:09.240 --> 00:01:13.840]   named lest I build on someone else's foundation, but as it is written, those who have never
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:19.720]   been told of him will see, and those who have never heard will understand.
[00:01:19.720 --> 00:01:24.920]   Let's pray.
[00:01:24.920 --> 00:01:30.120]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this morning, and as we have gathered
[00:01:30.120 --> 00:01:37.480]   together corporately to worship you, to honor you, to give you our hearts, Lord God, a reasonable
[00:01:37.480 --> 00:01:44.000]   response to your grace, we pray this morning that your Holy Spirit would lead and guide.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:46.960]   Help us, Lord, to be eager to hear and eager to apply your word.
[00:01:46.960 --> 00:01:49.480]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:54.120]   All right, as you know, we're in the study of the Book of Romans, and we're at the
[00:01:54.120 --> 00:01:56.200]   end part of it.
[00:01:56.200 --> 00:02:01.960]   And Paul has been expositing the gospel message beginning chapter 1 all the way to chapter
[00:02:01.960 --> 00:02:07.280]   15, and we're kind of in the middle part of it where the end of chapter 15 and 16 is
[00:02:07.280 --> 00:02:08.280]   sort of a postscript.
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:11.560]   It's kind of the end of the letter where he's saying, you know, bye to the church,
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:12.960]   and this is why he wrote it.
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.080]   So you know, if we're not careful, we can look at the last chapter and a half thinking
[00:02:17.080 --> 00:02:20.880]   like, well, he's done with the gospel, so he's just saying bye, so it's not really
[00:02:20.880 --> 00:02:26.120]   important for us to dig too deep into that, which is not the case.
[00:02:26.120 --> 00:02:30.640]   Obviously, there's no part of Scripture where we should ever skim over.
[00:02:30.640 --> 00:02:36.600]   In fact, the reason why this part of Scripture is so important is Paul started in Romans
[00:02:36.600 --> 00:02:40.400]   chapter 1 the necessity of the gospel, why we need it, because we've all sinned, fall
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:43.260]   short of the glory of God, Jew and Gentile alike.
[00:02:43.260 --> 00:02:48.180]   And then he introduced us to Christ and his sacrifice, and then the ramification of that.
[00:02:48.180 --> 00:02:51.060]   What did we receive as a result of that in chapter 8?
[00:02:51.060 --> 00:02:55.020]   Chapter 9 through 11 connects us to the Old Testament, what he has been doing with the
[00:02:55.020 --> 00:03:00.020]   nation of Israel, what he's planning to do going forward with Israel and Gentiles.
[00:03:00.020 --> 00:03:05.240]   And then we got to chapter 12, and view of all of that, and view of all that he has done,
[00:03:05.240 --> 00:03:10.260]   we ought to give our lives as a living sacrifice, and in the sacrifice, the greatest application
[00:03:10.260 --> 00:03:16.540]   of that is to live a life of worship, to love one another, to reflect that gospel in our
[00:03:16.540 --> 00:03:17.540]   lives.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:21.700]   That's where we ended in verse 13 in chapter 5.
[00:03:21.700 --> 00:03:25.100]   Chapter 14 is Paul's defense of his ministry.
[00:03:25.100 --> 00:03:28.980]   So last week, this week, and probably for the next maybe about two or three more weeks,
[00:03:28.980 --> 00:03:34.620]   we're going to be talking about Paul's application of that gospel in his own life.
[00:03:34.620 --> 00:03:37.980]   So up to this point, Paul has been preaching about the message of the cross, he's been
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:42.100]   teaching about how it ought to look in the life of the individual and in the church,
[00:03:42.100 --> 00:03:46.060]   now he's going to be showing us what it looks like in his life.
[00:03:46.060 --> 00:03:49.620]   What is the preaching of the gospel, and why is he engaged in what he is engaged in?
[00:03:49.620 --> 00:03:56.180]   So last week, we looked at Paul said that he spoke with boldness, that despite the persecution
[00:03:56.180 --> 00:04:01.640]   everywhere he is going, he's been persecuted, possibility of death, eventually he gets beheaded
[00:04:01.640 --> 00:04:03.820]   because of this message.
[00:04:03.820 --> 00:04:08.260]   But he says the reason why he spoke with boldness was because there was clarity that he was
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:09.820]   speaking on God's behalf.
[00:04:09.820 --> 00:04:14.920]   This was not a bunch of people who got together in a think tank and said, you know, maybe
[00:04:14.920 --> 00:04:18.500]   we should have these ideas spread and start this.
[00:04:18.500 --> 00:04:24.060]   It was a direct revelation that he got from God, and he clearly knew who he was serving,
[00:04:24.060 --> 00:04:26.100]   even if it was at the point of death.
[00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:33.260]   He said, so one, his message itself came with clarity because he knew who he was representing.
[00:04:33.260 --> 00:04:36.340]   The second point we're going to look at, and that's the main point, main thing that we're
[00:04:36.340 --> 00:04:44.020]   going to stay at this morning, is that Paul wrote to transform and not simply to inform.
[00:04:44.020 --> 00:04:48.060]   Paul wrote to transform and not just simply to inform.
[00:04:48.060 --> 00:04:53.600]   We're going to see that the content of what he is saying here, majority of it is not new
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.860]   to the Romans.
[00:04:55.860 --> 00:05:02.220]   Paul starts in verse 14, he says, "I myself am satisfied about you, my brothers."
[00:05:02.220 --> 00:05:07.420]   He's not writing to a church filled with non-Christians who needed to hear the gospel so they can
[00:05:07.420 --> 00:05:10.340]   repent and be justified of their sins.
[00:05:10.340 --> 00:05:15.260]   He actually starts the letter in Romans 1.8, and he says, "First, I thank my God through
[00:05:15.260 --> 00:05:20.980]   Jesus Christ for all of you, because your faith is proclaimed in all the world."
[00:05:20.980 --> 00:05:26.720]   So one other church we hear Paul saying this is the church of Thessalonica, because they
[00:05:26.720 --> 00:05:31.540]   received the gospel and they're loved for one another, and the way that they were responding
[00:05:31.540 --> 00:05:37.820]   to the gospel was exemplary, that even before Paul would go to distant parts of Macedonia,
[00:05:37.820 --> 00:05:41.780]   the news about their conversion went ahead of them.
[00:05:41.780 --> 00:05:45.020]   And so Paul used the same words to describe the Roman Christians.
[00:05:45.020 --> 00:05:47.660]   He hasn't come to this church, but he heard of them.
[00:05:47.660 --> 00:05:49.720]   He heard of their faith.
[00:05:49.720 --> 00:05:54.060]   So he's not talking to non-Christians, and he's not talking to young Christians.
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:58.820]   He goes on, he says, "I'm satisfied about you," and I'm convinced that they are full
[00:05:58.820 --> 00:06:01.060]   of goodness.
[00:06:01.060 --> 00:06:04.700]   They're not just good in application, they're full of it.
[00:06:04.700 --> 00:06:05.700]   They're rich.
[00:06:05.700 --> 00:06:08.460]   They are filled with all knowledge.
[00:06:08.460 --> 00:06:12.300]   Again, Paul is not writing this because they did not know.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:16.420]   It says Paul describes them as people who are filled with knowledge.
[00:06:16.420 --> 00:06:20.340]   And then finally, it says they are able to instruct one another.
[00:06:20.340 --> 00:06:25.020]   Not only were they strong Christians, not only did they apply it exemplary, and not
[00:06:25.020 --> 00:06:30.180]   only did they have knowledge, they were actually able to disciple one another.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:35.940]   They had everything that you would want from a good, solid, healthy church.
[00:06:35.940 --> 00:06:42.100]   So the natural question that we would ask is, why did he spend so much time and effort,
[00:06:42.100 --> 00:06:48.180]   the longest and the most tedious of all of his letters, to a church that may on the surface
[00:06:48.180 --> 00:06:50.900]   seem like they didn't need it?
[00:06:50.900 --> 00:06:52.940]   We can understand why he wrote to the Galatians.
[00:06:52.940 --> 00:06:54.060]   There were all kinds of problems.
[00:06:54.060 --> 00:06:58.340]   We understand the length in the Corinthians, because they had all kinds of problems in
[00:06:58.340 --> 00:06:59.620]   that church.
[00:06:59.620 --> 00:07:05.340]   But there is no particular problem that Paul was writing to for the Romans.
[00:07:05.340 --> 00:07:09.020]   In fact, the way he describes them, they're a model church.
[00:07:09.020 --> 00:07:13.420]   They were full of knowledge, full of goodness.
[00:07:13.420 --> 00:07:16.380]   Why does he write to this church?
[00:07:16.380 --> 00:07:26.040]   And again, before I begin to kind of hopefully unfold what's happening here, what Paul says
[00:07:26.040 --> 00:07:29.540]   here, it is so crucial.
[00:07:29.540 --> 00:07:32.980]   In my opinion, to the modern-day church.
[00:07:32.980 --> 00:07:35.980]   When I say modern-day, I'm talking about in particular here.
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:40.780]   It may be more specifically to Orange County, maybe even more specifically to this particular
[00:07:40.780 --> 00:07:46.020]   area, because we are surrounded by mega-churches.
[00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.220]   There's new church plant coming into this area all the time.
[00:07:49.220 --> 00:07:53.660]   I meet young pastors who want to plant a church in Irvine or Tustin or at least in Orange
[00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:58.060]   County, and I probably meet at least about five to ten of them per year.
[00:07:58.060 --> 00:08:00.180]   I go, "Well, you've been here in this area.
[00:08:00.180 --> 00:08:01.180]   What's needed?"
[00:08:01.180 --> 00:08:04.660]   And I would talk to them about different church plants and what's going on.
[00:08:04.660 --> 00:08:08.900]   And so we are saturated with knowledge.
[00:08:08.900 --> 00:08:16.020]   In fact, if during the summertime, around June, July, and August, if you go to the airport,
[00:08:16.020 --> 00:08:17.020]   what do you see typically?
[00:08:17.020 --> 00:08:23.460]   Obviously, you see typical people who are at the airport just traveling.
[00:08:23.460 --> 00:08:27.980]   You see a lot of young people headed out to short-term missions.
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:31.300]   And then if you hang out there long enough, you see a lot of young people coming back
[00:08:31.300 --> 00:08:32.920]   from short-term missions.
[00:08:32.920 --> 00:08:36.980]   We have several seminaries that are about 10 to 15, 20-minute driving distance in this
[00:08:36.980 --> 00:08:38.300]   area.
[00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:43.420]   In any direction, about 10 to 15-minute drive, you will hit some kind of a mega-church, meaning
[00:08:43.420 --> 00:08:47.380]   there's probably more than 5,000 to 10,000 people gathering together every Sunday in
[00:08:47.380 --> 00:08:49.820]   any direction from here.
[00:08:49.820 --> 00:08:56.460]   So we are saturated, at least on the surface, with superficial knowledge about Christ, about
[00:08:56.460 --> 00:09:00.020]   the gospel, about the Bible, various theologies.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:05.500]   You and I are living not only in a particular time in history, but a particular place in
[00:09:05.500 --> 00:09:13.540]   the world where there is more information about Christ, more talks, more access, more
[00:09:13.540 --> 00:09:18.980]   preaching, more gathering, more worshiping, more evangelism, at least on the surface,
[00:09:18.980 --> 00:09:23.900]   more short-term missions taking place than any other time in human history, in Christian
[00:09:23.900 --> 00:09:25.460]   history.
[00:09:25.460 --> 00:09:34.260]   Yet, the biggest problem that you and I have is our passion.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:39.780]   We have it, but everything we have has become convenient.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:46.420]   And along with that, we are saturated with churches and with people, and even up on the
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:51.860]   pulpits where the gospel of Jesus Christ has become old.
[00:09:51.860 --> 00:09:57.700]   It's something that we already know, something we've already heard, something we've already
[00:09:57.700 --> 00:10:00.860]   studied, something we've already shared.
[00:10:00.860 --> 00:10:06.140]   Paul says in verse 15, "But on some points," he says, "I know you are full of knowledge,
[00:10:06.140 --> 00:10:08.900]   I know you are full of goodness, I know you are believers, I know you are able to instruct
[00:10:08.900 --> 00:10:14.460]   one another, but on some points I have written to you very boldly by way of reminder because
[00:10:14.460 --> 00:10:17.980]   of the grace given me by Christ, by God."
[00:10:17.980 --> 00:10:19.900]   He said, "I'm speaking to you boldly."
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:26.140]   I mean, if he knew that they already know this, why speak boldly?
[00:10:26.140 --> 00:10:28.580]   He's preaching to the choir.
[00:10:28.580 --> 00:10:36.740]   Why is he so passionate about reinstating the things that they already know, that he
[00:10:36.740 --> 00:10:39.300]   already says that they know all of this?
[00:10:39.300 --> 00:10:44.140]   They're even able to instruct one another with this, and yet he says he is bold by way
[00:10:44.140 --> 00:10:49.340]   of reminder.
[00:10:49.340 --> 00:10:54.900]   And I'm going to get to this point over and over again in today's text.
[00:10:54.900 --> 00:11:00.780]   The point that Paul is trying to make, and the reason why I believe this is so important,
[00:11:00.780 --> 00:11:09.100]   is because we have to admit, you've heard enough about the gospel.
[00:11:09.100 --> 00:11:12.460]   You know the scriptures, especially, I mean, you're at a Bible teaching church, so the
[00:11:12.460 --> 00:11:17.380]   Word of God is being exposited in your presence in Bible study, in small groups.
[00:11:17.380 --> 00:11:21.500]   We're discussed, we have retreats, we have Sunday sermons, and we're so saturated with
[00:11:21.500 --> 00:11:26.940]   God's Word, we're always looking for something different, something new.
[00:11:26.940 --> 00:11:29.420]   Paul says exactly the opposite.
[00:11:29.420 --> 00:11:32.860]   I'm going to tell you what you already know, and I'm going to keep reminding you of the
[00:11:32.860 --> 00:11:35.140]   same thing that you do know.
[00:11:35.140 --> 00:11:38.880]   If you have your Bibles, turn with me to 2 Peter 1, 3 to 15.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.340]   If you don't have your Bible, the text will be up on the screen, but if you do have your
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:49.580]   Bible, I want you to be in the habit of looking at your Bible.
[00:11:49.580 --> 00:11:54.820]   In 2 Peter 1, 3 to 15, Peter says something very similar to the reason why he's writing
[00:11:54.820 --> 00:11:55.820]   this letter.
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:12:02.260]   He says, "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and godliness."
[00:12:02.260 --> 00:12:07.460]   Everything that you and I need for our spiritual growth, we have.
[00:12:07.460 --> 00:12:12.620]   So if any Christian, in particular today, considering everything that we have on top
[00:12:12.620 --> 00:12:19.740]   of what the early church had, if we ever say, "I can't grow because I don't have this,"
[00:12:19.740 --> 00:12:22.700]   that's no different than Adam saying, "I've sinned because of that woman that you put
[00:12:22.700 --> 00:12:24.220]   here."
[00:12:24.220 --> 00:12:26.460]   It's not my fault, it's a circumstance that you put me in.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:28.420]   That's why I can't grow.
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:32.860]   Peter says, "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain to life and
[00:12:32.860 --> 00:12:37.780]   godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us to His own glory and excellence."
[00:12:37.780 --> 00:12:40.140]   He's not talking about the information about Christ.
[00:12:40.140 --> 00:12:44.700]   He's talking about knowledge, meaning personal encounter with Christ.
[00:12:44.700 --> 00:12:52.980]   That everything that I need for life of godliness, I have in this relationship with Jesus Christ.
[00:12:52.980 --> 00:12:59.180]   So for any Christian, any genuine Christian who's been saved, had the Holy Spirit, who
[00:12:59.180 --> 00:13:05.860]   says, "I can't grow because of this," is denying what Peter clearly says here.
[00:13:05.860 --> 00:13:10.180]   Verse four, "By which He has granted to us His precious and very great promises so that
[00:13:10.180 --> 00:13:14.020]   through them you may become partakers of the divine nature, having escaped from the corruption
[00:13:14.020 --> 00:13:16.580]   that is in the world because of sinful desire."
[00:13:16.580 --> 00:13:21.260]   In other words, the reason why we were saved is because we encountered Christ.
[00:13:21.260 --> 00:13:26.780]   And it is this relationship, this knowledge of Him, and in Him we have all these things.
[00:13:26.780 --> 00:13:31.660]   Verse five, "For this very reason, since you have everything that you need for a life of
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:36.500]   godliness, for this very reason, make every effort to supplement your faith with virtue,
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:40.500]   virtue with knowledge, knowledge with self-control, self-control steadfastness, steadfastness
[00:13:40.500 --> 00:13:45.220]   with godliness, godliness with brotherly affection, and brotherly affection with love."
[00:13:45.220 --> 00:13:51.820]   In other words, since you have already everything that you need for a life of godliness, now
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:53.540]   it's your turn.
[00:13:53.540 --> 00:13:55.700]   How are you going to respond to that?
[00:13:55.700 --> 00:13:58.500]   For this very reason, right?
[00:13:58.500 --> 00:14:03.380]   The ball is not on God's court and saying, "Well, God, do something."
[00:14:03.380 --> 00:14:05.220]   Leaders do something.
[00:14:05.220 --> 00:14:06.220]   People around me do something.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:09.860]   He said, "No, I'm waiting for you."
[00:14:09.860 --> 00:14:17.300]   He's saying, "Considering all of this, make every effort, make every effort to add to
[00:14:17.300 --> 00:14:18.420]   your faith virtue."
[00:14:18.420 --> 00:14:24.060]   And then He says, "This knowledge that you have received," and then He gives all these
[00:14:24.060 --> 00:14:28.260]   different things that we ought to respond, and ultimately He says, "to practice this
[00:14:28.260 --> 00:14:34.740]   love," which is what Paul has been saying in chapter 12 up to chapter 15.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:38.020]   But I wanted to continue in verse 8 where He says, "For if these qualities are yours
[00:14:38.020 --> 00:14:43.660]   and increasing, they keep you from being ineffective or unfruitful in the knowledge of our Lord
[00:14:43.660 --> 00:14:45.920]   Jesus Christ."
[00:14:45.920 --> 00:14:51.540]   If we're just hearers of the Word, and we say, "Well, I can't grow because of this,"
[00:14:51.540 --> 00:14:57.060]   and as a result, we just kind of passively wait for revival to come, we're passively
[00:14:57.060 --> 00:15:02.860]   waiting for somebody else or something else to happen in order that I can respond to God,
[00:15:02.860 --> 00:15:11.380]   it says you become ineffective and unfruitful in what you have already been given.
[00:15:11.380 --> 00:15:14.900]   You already have everything that you need for a life of godliness, and you say, "I
[00:15:14.900 --> 00:15:20.100]   can't be godly because I don't have this," and then you're not bearing fruit, and you
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:22.100]   become ineffective.
[00:15:22.100 --> 00:15:25.860]   But that's not where it stops in verse 9.
[00:15:25.860 --> 00:15:34.060]   "For whoever lacks these qualities is so nearsighted that he is blind."
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:37.220]   Nearsightedness basically means that you can only see what is immediately in front of you,
[00:15:37.220 --> 00:15:41.660]   and you don't have a perspective of what's coming.
[00:15:41.660 --> 00:15:48.100]   So He says that if you hear and you do not apply the Word of God, and there's no radical
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:52.500]   change, you're ineffective, you're being unfruitful, what is the result of that?
[00:15:52.500 --> 00:15:53.660]   You're blind.
[00:15:53.660 --> 00:15:57.060]   You're only living for today.
[00:15:57.060 --> 00:15:58.840]   If I do this, how is it going to affect me today?
[00:15:58.840 --> 00:16:02.920]   So all the decisions that we make are no different than the world.
[00:16:02.920 --> 00:16:05.780]   If I do this, if I sacrifice, what do I get today?
[00:16:05.780 --> 00:16:10.140]   But we don't live for eternity, because we don't have eternal perspective.
[00:16:10.140 --> 00:16:12.860]   That's what He says, we become nearsighted and blind.
[00:16:12.860 --> 00:16:16.900]   Having forgotten that He was cleansed from His former sins, therefore, brothers, be all
[00:16:16.900 --> 00:16:22.260]   the more diligent to make your calling and election sure.
[00:16:22.260 --> 00:16:27.300]   Because once you become ineffective, unfruitful, and you become nearsighted and blind, what's
[00:16:27.300 --> 00:16:29.540]   the first thing that happens?
[00:16:29.540 --> 00:16:32.620]   You begin to doubt your election.
[00:16:32.620 --> 00:16:36.060]   You don't have assurance of salvation.
[00:16:36.060 --> 00:16:40.500]   And why is this so important to make your election sure?
[00:16:40.500 --> 00:16:43.660]   Because the Scripture says, "If you abide in My Word, My Word abides in you.
[00:16:43.660 --> 00:16:46.260]   Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:16:46.260 --> 00:16:51.060]   Prayer is not a free ticket for everyone to just come and say, "Ask God whatever you want."
[00:16:51.060 --> 00:16:53.380]   He didn't say that.
[00:16:53.380 --> 00:16:56.500]   If you abide in Me, My Word abides in you, ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:57.500]   you.
[00:16:57.500 --> 00:17:00.060]   So when you don't have assurance of salvation, you don't have assurance that God is listening
[00:17:00.060 --> 00:17:01.940]   to you.
[00:17:01.940 --> 00:17:06.300]   And this is the reason why so many people do not regularly pray.
[00:17:06.300 --> 00:17:12.060]   Why engage in something when you're not sure if God is even listening?
[00:17:12.060 --> 00:17:18.140]   And the reason why it's hard for us to invest in the things that are long-term, because
[00:17:18.140 --> 00:17:23.140]   those are promises given to those who have assurance of salvation.
[00:17:23.140 --> 00:17:26.340]   It was not a blanket statement for the world.
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:30.580]   All the promises on Scripture are for those who have repented of their sins, has declared
[00:17:30.580 --> 00:17:35.300]   Him Lord and Savior, and who has a personal relationship with Him.
[00:17:35.300 --> 00:17:42.980]   So if you hear and you are not applying, you're not making every effort in your spiritual
[00:17:42.980 --> 00:17:49.080]   growth, and you become ineffective and unfruitful, you become nearsighted and you're blind to
[00:17:49.080 --> 00:17:56.420]   what is coming, and you forget all of these things, you begin to doubt whether you express
[00:17:56.420 --> 00:18:00.140]   it with your words or by your action.
[00:18:00.140 --> 00:18:03.380]   Does any of this have anything to do with me?
[00:18:03.380 --> 00:18:08.820]   And once you begin to doubt your assurance of salvation, it affects your prayer, it affects
[00:18:08.820 --> 00:18:16.140]   your fellowship, it affects evangelism, it affects the promises of God, it basically
[00:18:16.140 --> 00:18:21.740]   nullifies everything that we do as Christians.
[00:18:21.740 --> 00:18:24.400]   For if you practice these qualities, you will never fall.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:28.740]   For in this way there will be richly provided for you an entrance into the eternal kingdom
[00:18:28.740 --> 00:18:30.580]   of our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.
[00:18:30.580 --> 00:18:38.940]   So again, what Peter is saying to them is not just to be hearers, but to hear it and
[00:18:38.940 --> 00:18:41.460]   to respond.
[00:18:41.460 --> 00:18:45.100]   That's what Paul has been saying, in view of this mercy, give your life as a living
[00:18:45.100 --> 00:18:51.660]   sacrifice and in particular, to live a life of love in practice.
[00:18:51.660 --> 00:18:59.020]   Paul is writing to this church who has all of this knowledge already, not simply to inform
[00:18:59.020 --> 00:19:00.740]   for the purpose of transforming.
[00:19:00.740 --> 00:19:06.340]   So in verse 12, "Therefore I intend always to remind you of these qualities.
[00:19:06.340 --> 00:19:10.960]   Though you know them and are established in the truth that you have, I think it right
[00:19:10.960 --> 00:19:17.020]   as long as I am in this body to stir you up by way of reminder, since I know that the
[00:19:17.020 --> 00:19:21.220]   putting off of my body will be soon, as our Lord Jesus Christ made clear to me, and I
[00:19:21.220 --> 00:19:26.860]   will make every effort so that after my departure you will be able at any time to recall these
[00:19:26.860 --> 00:19:29.620]   things over and over again.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:33.360]   I'm telling you what you already know and I'm trying to remind you that even after I
[00:19:33.360 --> 00:19:36.780]   die that you would remember.
[00:19:36.780 --> 00:19:43.440]   Because the core of who we are is founded upon these truths of the gospel.
[00:19:43.440 --> 00:19:49.660]   So the moment that it becomes dull, the moment you think that you've mastered it, you've
[00:19:49.660 --> 00:19:52.420]   drifted from him.
[00:19:52.420 --> 00:19:59.380]   That's why in John chapter 15, Jesus says to his disciple before he departs, he says,
[00:19:59.380 --> 00:20:04.180]   "If you abide in me," my words abide in you, "ask whatever you wish."
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:06.740]   You cannot bear any fruit unless you abide in me.
[00:20:06.740 --> 00:20:11.300]   The word abide, for the longest time I thought he was talking about abiding, obeying his
[00:20:11.300 --> 00:20:14.300]   word, which does have that meaning.
[00:20:14.300 --> 00:20:19.580]   But the more natural understanding of the word abide in Greek, which is meno, it means
[00:20:19.580 --> 00:20:23.300]   to remain or to continue.
[00:20:23.300 --> 00:20:28.060]   And the reason why Jesus says you need to continue or remain in me is because Jesus
[00:20:28.060 --> 00:20:30.220]   was departing.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:34.060]   As long as they were with Christ, they felt safe.
[00:20:34.060 --> 00:20:35.060]   They were fed.
[00:20:35.060 --> 00:20:36.060]   They were taken care of.
[00:20:36.060 --> 00:20:37.180]   They were at clear direction.
[00:20:37.180 --> 00:20:38.800]   What are we going to do if you leave us?
[00:20:38.800 --> 00:20:43.540]   Because Jesus has been telling them, he's about to go where I go you cannot come.
[00:20:43.540 --> 00:20:46.140]   And he says, no, the Holy Spirit's going to come.
[00:20:46.140 --> 00:20:51.300]   And he's going to remind you of everything that I told you.
[00:20:51.300 --> 00:20:56.620]   So the primary work of the Holy Spirit to the non-Christians is to convict them of their
[00:20:56.620 --> 00:20:57.620]   sin.
[00:20:57.620 --> 00:21:04.100]   The primary work of the Holy Spirit to Christians is to remind us of Christ.
[00:21:04.100 --> 00:21:05.580]   For what purpose?
[00:21:05.580 --> 00:21:07.760]   So we do not stray.
[00:21:07.760 --> 00:21:11.720]   We do not move along.
[00:21:11.720 --> 00:21:16.520]   The danger that you and I fall into is that we hear the gospel and we begin to study the
[00:21:16.520 --> 00:21:22.020]   word of God and then we become so sophisticated in our walk with God.
[00:21:22.020 --> 00:21:27.800]   We become experts in church planting, small group discipleship, evangelism, missions.
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:34.140]   And we become experts because we have so much knowledge, so much experience, so much books.
[00:21:34.140 --> 00:21:39.900]   And yet we are dull to the things of Christ.
[00:21:39.900 --> 00:21:42.520]   Paul says in Philippians 3, "Finally, my brothers, rejoice in the Lord.
[00:21:42.520 --> 00:21:47.340]   To write the same things to you is no trouble to me and is safe for you."
[00:21:47.340 --> 00:21:49.780]   I need to keep reminding you to keep you safe.
[00:21:49.780 --> 00:21:50.920]   Second Peter 3.1.
[00:21:50.920 --> 00:21:53.560]   This is now the second letter that I am writing to you, beloved.
[00:21:53.560 --> 00:21:58.100]   In both of them, I am stirring up a sincere mind by way of reminder.
[00:21:58.100 --> 00:22:00.500]   Peter says over and over again.
[00:22:00.500 --> 00:22:02.020]   Paul is reminding the Gentiles.
[00:22:02.020 --> 00:22:04.500]   Peter is reminding the Jews.
[00:22:04.500 --> 00:22:08.860]   Revelation 2.5, "Remember, therefore, from where you have fallen.
[00:22:08.860 --> 00:22:10.860]   Repent and do the works you did at first."
[00:22:10.860 --> 00:22:14.580]   Again, Revelation 3.3, "Remember then what you received and heard.
[00:22:14.580 --> 00:22:15.700]   Keep it and repent."
[00:22:15.700 --> 00:22:19.260]   Over and over and over and over again.
[00:22:19.260 --> 00:22:23.380]   We are told in the Old Testament, New Testament, "Remember."
[00:22:23.380 --> 00:22:30.580]   Because our primary challenge living in this world is just drifting.
[00:22:30.580 --> 00:22:34.340]   Just drifting.
[00:22:34.340 --> 00:22:37.200]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:40.620]   What is the greatest commandment?
[00:22:40.620 --> 00:22:41.620]   Don't say it.
[00:22:41.620 --> 00:22:42.620]   I just want you to think it.
[00:22:42.620 --> 00:22:43.620]   What is the greatest commandment you said?
[00:22:43.620 --> 00:22:46.540]   "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength."
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:47.540]   That's the greatest commandment, right?
[00:22:47.540 --> 00:22:50.540]   So if that's the greatest commandment, that ought to be our greatest pursuit.
[00:22:50.540 --> 00:22:51.540]   Right?
[00:22:51.540 --> 00:22:54.820]   I mean, that's just Christianity 101.
[00:22:54.820 --> 00:22:56.740]   So let me ask you.
[00:22:56.740 --> 00:23:03.060]   When did you love the Lord the most?
[00:23:03.060 --> 00:23:06.300]   Just think about it.
[00:23:06.300 --> 00:23:12.080]   I would guess, and I would say it's a somewhat educated guess because of years of just counseling
[00:23:12.080 --> 00:23:16.280]   and talking and even from my own testimony, I would guess that the time that you were
[00:23:16.280 --> 00:23:20.300]   the most passionate, you were the greatest witness, you loved fellowship the most, you
[00:23:20.300 --> 00:23:27.000]   sang with the greatest passion, was when you first met the Lord.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.120]   That's why in Revelation chapter 2, when he's rebuking this church that had all these great
[00:23:31.120 --> 00:23:34.960]   qualities, he says, "Remember the height from which you had fallen."
[00:23:34.960 --> 00:23:38.820]   He doesn't say, "Go look and see if there's other things that you can do to make your
[00:23:38.820 --> 00:23:39.820]   Christian life better."
[00:23:39.820 --> 00:23:44.360]   He says, "Remember the height from which you had fallen."
[00:23:44.360 --> 00:23:46.640]   It's the beginning.
[00:23:46.640 --> 00:23:48.800]   It's the beginning.
[00:23:48.800 --> 00:23:50.840]   What did they have in the beginning?
[00:23:50.840 --> 00:23:54.880]   We always talk about how we ought to go back to the early church.
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:57.680]   We need to be like the early church.
[00:23:57.680 --> 00:23:59.880]   What was it about the early church?
[00:23:59.880 --> 00:24:04.620]   It's like, did they have training?
[00:24:04.620 --> 00:24:10.120]   Was there, did they sit under some great teaching for so many years?
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:16.400]   Was it the one-to-one discipleship that 3,000 and the 4,000 received from the previous mentors?
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:20.680]   What was it about the early church that they were so selfless and even in the context of
[00:24:20.680 --> 00:24:29.120]   being stoned and running for their lives, they couldn't contain sharing the gospel?
[00:24:29.120 --> 00:24:35.540]   The only thing that we can point to is they met Christ and they were convicted over their
[00:24:35.540 --> 00:24:38.100]   sins.
[00:24:38.100 --> 00:24:44.260]   And so Jesus is telling his disciples, "Don't move from that.
[00:24:44.260 --> 00:24:49.020]   Don't move from that because that's when you're the most powerful.
[00:24:49.020 --> 00:24:50.780]   That's when you're the most effective.
[00:24:50.780 --> 00:24:54.220]   That's when you're singing and worship is the most genuine.
[00:24:54.220 --> 00:24:59.660]   Because when you've been affected by this relationship with Christ, it wasn't because
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:00.860]   of years of training.
[00:25:00.860 --> 00:25:03.880]   It wasn't because of years of study.
[00:25:03.880 --> 00:25:06.980]   It wasn't because of years of experience.
[00:25:06.980 --> 00:25:10.540]   So if the greatest commandment is to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul,
[00:25:10.540 --> 00:25:16.540]   mind, and strength, and the greatest time when that was true, it has nothing to do with
[00:25:16.540 --> 00:25:19.140]   our works.
[00:25:19.140 --> 00:25:21.640]   Our works are simply a response to that.
[00:25:21.640 --> 00:25:26.180]   He wants us to worship in response to that.
[00:25:26.180 --> 00:25:34.420]   That's why he says, "I'm stirring up as a reminder to you to tell you again to go back
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:35.700]   to what you drifted from."
[00:25:35.700 --> 00:25:42.820]   See, the danger that you and I have, just like anything else, we're in an area where
[00:25:42.820 --> 00:25:48.620]   we have all the food that we can possibly eat all the time.
[00:25:48.620 --> 00:25:51.820]   And people often ask me, "Hey, Pastor Peter, I want to take you out and treat you out to
[00:25:51.820 --> 00:25:52.820]   eat.
[00:25:52.820 --> 00:25:54.580]   What do you like to eat?"
[00:25:54.580 --> 00:25:57.300]   Everything and nothing.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.540]   Because whatever I like to eat, I eat all the time.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:01.540]   So I don't really value it.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:07.040]   I tell you I like sushi, but sometimes I'm tired of it because I've eaten it yesterday.
[00:26:07.040 --> 00:26:10.660]   So I'd like some Mexican today, or tomorrow I might want some pho, or the next day some
[00:26:10.660 --> 00:26:11.660]   salad maybe.
[00:26:11.660 --> 00:26:14.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:26:14.700 --> 00:26:19.300]   But we get to have everything that we want all the time, so we don't necessarily value
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.420]   anything in particular.
[00:26:22.420 --> 00:26:26.320]   And sometimes that's the way we are spiritually.
[00:26:26.320 --> 00:26:32.620]   Because we are so saturated with everything, everything has become old, just dull.
[00:26:32.620 --> 00:26:38.060]   And so we have to hear messages with some great presentation.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:39.740]   It's not the message itself, but the presentation.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:43.600]   It has to be packaged in a certain way.
[00:26:43.600 --> 00:26:48.380]   But the real power is in Christ.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:51.540]   And that's why Paul is telling you, "I know you know all these things.
[00:26:51.540 --> 00:26:52.540]   You are full of knowledge.
[00:26:52.540 --> 00:26:53.540]   You are full of goodness.
[00:26:53.540 --> 00:26:55.260]   You are able to teach one another.
[00:26:55.260 --> 00:27:01.020]   Your Christianity, your response is being heralded all over the world.
[00:27:01.020 --> 00:27:04.520]   But I'm going to speak to you more boldly.
[00:27:04.520 --> 00:27:09.780]   Because on some of these points, I want to stir you up by way of reminder so that you
[00:27:09.780 --> 00:27:13.580]   do not stray.
[00:27:13.580 --> 00:27:21.020]   Because our fruitfulness comes directly linked to Him.
[00:27:21.020 --> 00:27:25.740]   People have a tendency, once you have heard certain things so many times, it's like, "I
[00:27:25.740 --> 00:27:26.740]   know this."
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:28.460]   Every once in a while, we'll say, "Hey, we're going to study Philippines."
[00:27:28.460 --> 00:27:30.460]   And somebody will say, "I already studied that."
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:31.460]   You know?
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:35.180]   "Oh, we're going to study Leviticus."
[00:27:35.180 --> 00:27:36.740]   "Oh, I took that class before."
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:37.740]   You know?
[00:27:37.740 --> 00:27:40.260]   "Oh, we're going to do quiet time in Ephesians."
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:41.260]   You know?
[00:27:41.260 --> 00:27:42.940]   "Oh, I've already done that a couple years ago."
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.140]   In other words, "I know this.
[00:27:45.140 --> 00:27:48.860]   I've been a Christian for a while, so let me teach."
[00:27:48.860 --> 00:27:52.580]   And that's one of the greatest dangers of being a leader of any kind, especially somebody
[00:27:52.580 --> 00:27:58.920]   who stands up here, where I'm constantly having to tell you things.
[00:27:58.920 --> 00:28:06.420]   Because once you become a pastor, or even a leader, you start putting on a teacher hat.
[00:28:06.420 --> 00:28:08.300]   And you know everything.
[00:28:08.300 --> 00:28:09.500]   Right?
[00:28:09.500 --> 00:28:14.500]   So whenever I get together with my pastor friends, I shared this with you before, I
[00:28:14.500 --> 00:28:17.580]   have to tell myself to shut up.
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.980]   Because we all know everything.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:21.380]   We all have the answers for the church.
[00:28:21.380 --> 00:28:22.980]   We all have answers for evangelism.
[00:28:22.980 --> 00:28:28.340]   So I have to tell myself to be quiet.
[00:28:28.340 --> 00:28:33.980]   And that's the detriment of leadership at times.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:42.020]   Because once we think that we know, from that moment on, we begin to deteriorate.
[00:28:42.020 --> 00:28:47.740]   Don't ever trust somebody who always has the answer to everything.
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:52.060]   Because that is not the person who is nearest to Christ.
[00:28:52.060 --> 00:28:59.580]   The person who is nearest to Christ is more aware of his weakness than when he first started.
[00:28:59.580 --> 00:29:03.860]   Because that's what he does when you're in his presence.
[00:29:03.860 --> 00:29:10.620]   Anything that you had desire to boast, anything that you boasted of in the presence of anybody
[00:29:10.620 --> 00:29:17.900]   else, but in the presence of God, all of a sudden, you become a babbling idiot.
[00:29:17.900 --> 00:29:21.380]   I mean, that's what his glory does.
[00:29:21.380 --> 00:29:24.380]   So that's why Paul is saying, I'm telling you, I'm going to remind you.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:28.820]   I had a missionary friend who went out to missions, and he came back on furlough about
[00:29:28.820 --> 00:29:29.820]   three years afterwards.
[00:29:29.820 --> 00:29:33.040]   And I asked him, what was the hardest part of being a missionary?
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:37.340]   And he said, the hardest part is continuing to go.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:39.120]   Continuing to go.
[00:29:39.120 --> 00:29:44.220]   They sacrificed everything, sold all their things, moved to a country and lived in a
[00:29:44.220 --> 00:29:46.020]   place where they weren't comfortable.
[00:29:46.020 --> 00:29:49.980]   But once they got out there, it became their home.
[00:29:49.980 --> 00:29:52.300]   They became comfortable.
[00:29:52.300 --> 00:29:55.420]   And he said, it's hard to continue to go.
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:59.660]   See, that's our problem.
[00:29:59.660 --> 00:30:01.600]   That's our temptation.
[00:30:01.600 --> 00:30:05.420]   After we've been a Christian for a while, we know.
[00:30:05.420 --> 00:30:08.780]   After we've led a little bit of worship, we know.
[00:30:08.780 --> 00:30:11.880]   After we've been a leader for a while, we know.
[00:30:11.880 --> 00:30:13.180]   If we led small group, we know.
[00:30:13.180 --> 00:30:16.300]   If we've been a Christian for a while, we know.
[00:30:16.300 --> 00:30:19.580]   And as a result of that, we begin to drift away.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:23.820]   First Corinthians 10, 12, "Therefore, let anyone who thinks that he stands take heed,
[00:30:23.820 --> 00:30:27.140]   lest he fall."
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:29.160]   This can even happen as a church.
[00:30:29.160 --> 00:30:30.860]   When you first plant the church, everybody's excited.
[00:30:30.860 --> 00:30:32.640]   We're going to reach the lost.
[00:30:32.640 --> 00:30:38.260]   But after the church gets to a certain size, we're no longer thinking about the lost.
[00:30:38.260 --> 00:30:39.860]   We're no longer desperate.
[00:30:39.860 --> 00:30:44.620]   Because people are gathering whether we pray or not.
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:47.140]   Fellowship just happens because there's a number of people.
[00:30:47.140 --> 00:30:49.900]   And we begin to forget why we were planted in the first place.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:50.900]   This can happen individually.
[00:30:50.900 --> 00:30:55.660]   It can happen as a church.
[00:30:55.660 --> 00:31:00.020]   You ever wonder why there are four Gospels?
[00:31:00.020 --> 00:31:02.940]   When I first became a Christian, I started reading through the Gospels.
[00:31:02.940 --> 00:31:03.940]   I was really confused.
[00:31:03.940 --> 00:31:07.180]   One, it started with a genealogy, so I just skimmed over that.
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:08.860]   I don't remember even reading that.
[00:31:08.860 --> 00:31:10.780]   I didn't understand any of it.
[00:31:10.780 --> 00:31:13.580]   But I was so excited about reading the Bible.
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:14.580]   I read Matthew.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:15.580]   Great.
[00:31:15.580 --> 00:31:18.300]   I'm like, "What happens next?"
[00:31:18.300 --> 00:31:20.700]   And then it starts over.
[00:31:20.700 --> 00:31:21.700]   So I started reading that.
[00:31:21.700 --> 00:31:22.700]   I said, "Okay."
[00:31:22.700 --> 00:31:23.700]   And then I go to Luke.
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.700]   And then it starts over.
[00:31:25.700 --> 00:31:27.260]   Wait, I remember this.
[00:31:27.260 --> 00:31:28.580]   I'm flipping back over to Matthew.
[00:31:28.580 --> 00:31:29.580]   He's like, "Wait a minute.
[00:31:29.580 --> 00:31:32.420]   There's another genealogy here in chapter three."
[00:31:32.420 --> 00:31:37.380]   And I began to wonder, like, why is there three separate accounts of the same story?
[00:31:37.380 --> 00:31:38.780]   John is a little bit different.
[00:31:38.780 --> 00:31:44.060]   John, over 80% of the content is different, but more than half of John's Gospel is about
[00:31:44.060 --> 00:31:46.740]   his last week of his life.
[00:31:46.740 --> 00:31:50.780]   But even that period, there's a lot of things that overlap.
[00:31:50.780 --> 00:31:56.940]   The wisdom behind the four different Gospels is to highlight the life and the glory of
[00:31:56.940 --> 00:32:04.220]   Christ in different angles because of its importance.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:08.940]   If you've ever bought a car, you went to a dealership, and whether it's like a $20,000
[00:32:08.940 --> 00:32:14.220]   car or $30,000 car, you know, I don't think anybody in this room, or at least that I know
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:17.620]   of, is so rich that $30,000 is nothing to you.
[00:32:17.620 --> 00:32:19.540]   So that's a lot of money you're going to invest.
[00:32:19.540 --> 00:32:24.380]   So you don't walk into the dealership and look at the front of the car and say, "This
[00:32:24.380 --> 00:32:26.060]   looks nice.
[00:32:26.060 --> 00:32:27.060]   Here's my check."
[00:32:27.060 --> 00:32:29.780]   You don't do that, right?
[00:32:29.780 --> 00:32:31.340]   Because it's a big investment.
[00:32:31.340 --> 00:32:33.220]   So you look at it, say, "Oh, it looks nice.
[00:32:33.220 --> 00:32:34.220]   What does the hood look like?"
[00:32:34.220 --> 00:32:38.120]   Or underneath the hood, you open it up and check out the engine, whether you know anything
[00:32:38.120 --> 00:32:39.120]   or not.
[00:32:39.120 --> 00:32:42.440]   You have to pretend like you know so you don't get ripped off.
[00:32:42.440 --> 00:32:45.660]   Look at the tires, you know.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:46.660]   Look at the cost.
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:48.220]   Look at what other people are saying.
[00:32:48.220 --> 00:32:49.220]   Is it worth buying?
[00:32:49.220 --> 00:32:50.580]   What are the problems it has?
[00:32:50.580 --> 00:32:56.020]   So you walk to the side and look at the door, look at the paint, the windows, power windows,
[00:32:56.020 --> 00:32:58.460]   what kind of power, what kind of gas mileage you have.
[00:32:58.460 --> 00:33:01.980]   You open up the trunk and you look at how much space and you're thinking, "If I had
[00:33:01.980 --> 00:33:05.180]   to put groceries in here, would it fit all of this?"
[00:33:05.180 --> 00:33:08.020]   And then you get into the car, right?
[00:33:08.020 --> 00:33:11.500]   Then you look at all the car, what does it look like with the lights turned off, the
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:13.300]   lights turned on.
[00:33:13.300 --> 00:33:16.980]   And then you get in the car and you drive it for a while to test what it looks like.
[00:33:16.980 --> 00:33:22.460]   And then you come back and then you start contemplating, "Do I know enough to make
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:24.860]   this decision?"
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:31.100]   And the more important it is, the more time you will take examining what it is.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:36.940]   See, the life of Christ, the book of Matthew is kind of like the dealership presenting
[00:33:36.940 --> 00:33:39.420]   to you that this is the car that you want.
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:40.980]   That's the book of Matthew.
[00:33:40.980 --> 00:33:42.860]   He's the fulfillment of all the prophecies.
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:44.700]   He's the king that's fulfilling the prophecy.
[00:33:44.700 --> 00:33:46.580]   So he's the dealership kind of like, "Here it is.
[00:33:46.580 --> 00:33:49.260]   This is the one that you've been looking for."
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:52.340]   Book of Mark is the mark that has all these actions.
[00:33:52.340 --> 00:33:54.460]   It records more miracles than any other book.
[00:33:54.460 --> 00:33:58.740]   The book of Mark is kind of like getting in the car and test driving you.
[00:33:58.740 --> 00:34:00.900]   Every chapter, he's doing something.
[00:34:00.900 --> 00:34:03.580]   He's healing people, raising people, and opening the eyes.
[00:34:03.580 --> 00:34:06.900]   So he's kind of like a lot of action.
[00:34:06.900 --> 00:34:11.220]   Luke is the buyer's perspective, is the human perspective, like, "What would I look like
[00:34:11.220 --> 00:34:13.940]   in this car?
[00:34:13.940 --> 00:34:16.580]   Are my kids going to fit into the back seat?"
[00:34:16.580 --> 00:34:20.140]   So it's the humanitarian, the human perspective.
[00:34:20.140 --> 00:34:28.020]   And the book of John is from above, where God is presenting his son to the world.
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:33.700]   Every aspect of it is being presented to us because it is that important.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.260]   In Hebrews 1.1, it says, "Long ago at many times and in many ways, God spoke to our fathers
[00:34:38.260 --> 00:34:41.740]   by the prophets."
[00:34:41.740 --> 00:34:49.060]   This message of Christ was so important that God used narratives, poetry, laws, prophecies,
[00:34:49.060 --> 00:34:58.940]   visions, signs, wonders, through kings, peasants, young, old, farmers, aristocrats, all for
[00:34:58.940 --> 00:35:01.240]   the purpose of what?
[00:35:01.240 --> 00:35:04.980]   So you can see from their angle.
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:09.220]   You know, when we take pictures to put on Instagram or Facebook, a lot of people have
[00:35:09.220 --> 00:35:16.900]   a certain angle that they like, because you know you look better this way than this way.
[00:35:16.900 --> 00:35:18.860]   So we notice, right?
[00:35:18.860 --> 00:35:24.100]   So you like to take pictures because you know you look different.
[00:35:24.100 --> 00:35:29.420]   Just even taking a simple picture.
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:33.400]   Think about who Christ is.
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:37.320]   Think about the ramification of what he has done.
[00:35:37.320 --> 00:35:43.540]   Think about the consequence of what you and I study.
[00:35:43.540 --> 00:35:53.820]   To come to that and look at the hood and say, "I know," is arrogance.
[00:35:53.820 --> 00:35:59.780]   That's why all of Scripture is a revelation that gives us a different angle of Christ.
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:05.220]   That all of human history prepared us to the cross, and all of human history after that
[00:36:05.220 --> 00:36:06.760]   pointed back to the cross.
[00:36:06.760 --> 00:36:10.900]   So do you think that there was only one sign pointing to Jesus and one sign pointing back
[00:36:10.900 --> 00:36:11.900]   to Jesus?
[00:36:11.900 --> 00:36:12.900]   No.
[00:36:12.900 --> 00:36:17.300]   Everything, every road led to the cross.
[00:36:17.300 --> 00:36:21.340]   That's why some of you guys who never knew anything about Leviticus, you had no idea.
[00:36:21.340 --> 00:36:30.060]   If you've never studied through Leviticus, you had no idea how rich it was about Christ.
[00:36:30.060 --> 00:36:36.660]   How all of these little intricate details prepared the nation of Israel to Christ.
[00:36:36.660 --> 00:36:40.580]   And then when you study the New Testament, every part of that, even the rebukes, all
[00:36:40.580 --> 00:36:43.940]   of them highlight Christ.
[00:36:43.940 --> 00:36:52.460]   And so the more we study, the more we spread light upon the cross, what happens?
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:56.120]   We change.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:59.700]   When we love something, it just doesn't get old.
[00:36:59.700 --> 00:37:05.140]   I don't know how many of you guys listen to ESPN Talk Radio on 710.
[00:37:05.140 --> 00:37:14.620]   It is amazing to me how much time they spend talking about everything related to sports.
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:18.900]   Like only sport that I have some interest in is in basketball.
[00:37:18.900 --> 00:37:22.260]   And even that, only Lakers, right?
[00:37:22.260 --> 00:37:25.900]   So I have a very small tolerance for what they talk about.
[00:37:25.900 --> 00:37:30.460]   So when they talk about Lakers, I can sit there and listen, especially now that LeBron
[00:37:30.460 --> 00:37:31.460]   came.
[00:37:31.460 --> 00:37:34.460]   But before LeBron came, they were talking about his shoe size.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:39.460]   What company, how much money he was making, where his sons are going to go to school,
[00:37:39.460 --> 00:37:41.780]   where he took vacation.
[00:37:41.780 --> 00:37:42.780]   His hairline.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:47.940]   They were talking about his hairline.
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:49.700]   Where he's going to live.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:50.700]   Who are his friends?
[00:37:50.700 --> 00:37:51.700]   Who is he talking to?
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.900]   And it's not enough to talk to him.
[00:37:52.900 --> 00:37:56.820]   They were talking to all of his friends and asking them, what does he like to eat?
[00:37:56.820 --> 00:37:57.860]   How does he prepare?
[00:37:57.860 --> 00:37:59.260]   How much time is he at the gym?
[00:37:59.260 --> 00:38:00.260]   When does he come in?
[00:38:00.260 --> 00:38:03.100]   When does he leave?
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:06.900]   And the reason why they do that is because there are hundreds of thousands and millions
[00:38:06.900 --> 00:38:11.460]   of people listening to this radio and they make a living off of that.
[00:38:11.460 --> 00:38:17.580]   If you're not interested in Lakers, if you're not interested in basketball, it sounds like
[00:38:17.580 --> 00:38:18.580]   utter nonsense.
[00:38:18.580 --> 00:38:19.580]   Utter nonsense.
[00:38:19.580 --> 00:38:26.300]   You're talking about his shoe size.
[00:38:26.300 --> 00:38:32.340]   And yet, they're making hundreds of millions of dollars talking about that.
[00:38:32.340 --> 00:38:38.420]   So how can we get bored talking about Christ?
[00:38:38.420 --> 00:38:42.820]   How can the study of the Word of God become so dull?
[00:38:42.820 --> 00:38:49.300]   How can the worship of this Savior, when all things are created by him and for him, when
[00:38:49.300 --> 00:38:56.220]   something so trivial like basketball can captivate our attention for hours and months and years,
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:04.460]   yet be so easily bored when it comes to our faith and our salvation in eternity?
[00:39:04.460 --> 00:39:11.900]   This is why he said, I know you know it, but I'm going to keep telling you.
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:13.060]   And I'm going to tell you from the top.
[00:39:13.060 --> 00:39:14.300]   I'm going to tell you from the side.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.300]   I'm going to tell you from behind.
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.300]   I'm going to tell you from inside.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:17.300]   I'm going to tell you when I'm young.
[00:39:17.300 --> 00:39:21.380]   I'm going to tell you when I'm old.
[00:39:21.380 --> 00:39:30.180]   To stir up as a way of reminder so we do not drift from this great salvation.
[00:39:30.180 --> 00:39:37.540]   If we're not careful, the most important person in our life can easily become an it instead
[00:39:37.540 --> 00:39:40.580]   of a he.
[00:39:40.580 --> 00:39:44.140]   He's just an idea, a figurehead.
[00:39:44.140 --> 00:39:47.500]   Our relationship with him is no different than our relationship with Donald Trump.
[00:39:47.500 --> 00:39:50.420]   He's just the President of the United States.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:55.940]   He makes big decisions, and we happen to live in the United States.
[00:39:55.940 --> 00:40:00.900]   God called us to be his children.
[00:40:00.900 --> 00:40:05.900]   He doesn't want us from a distance and pointing and say, oh, I believe in that God.
[00:40:05.900 --> 00:40:16.560]   He opened a door so that he can invite us to come to the throne of grace to worship.
[00:40:16.560 --> 00:40:19.580]   You see why this is so important?
[00:40:19.580 --> 00:40:21.340]   It's not just important.
[00:40:21.340 --> 00:40:22.340]   It's fundamental.
[00:40:22.340 --> 00:40:23.340]   It's crucial.
[00:40:23.340 --> 00:40:26.780]   If you missed this, you missed everything.
[00:40:26.780 --> 00:40:32.180]   God's not eager to see the church filled with nominal Christians.
[00:40:32.180 --> 00:40:37.260]   God is not waiting for Christians to regurgitate information that they heard, and so he regurgitated
[00:40:37.260 --> 00:40:39.140]   to somebody else.
[00:40:39.140 --> 00:40:44.220]   God's not looking at us to see how many people we're going to tolerate in our lives, add
[00:40:44.220 --> 00:40:47.980]   an obligation to him.
[00:40:47.980 --> 00:40:55.540]   All of it is so that he can rekindle worship, rekindle worship, that we may love our Lord
[00:40:55.540 --> 00:40:59.480]   with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:40:59.480 --> 00:41:10.340]   Let's take some time to pray this morning as we invite our worship to come up.
[00:41:10.340 --> 00:41:12.100]   Have we become bored?
[00:41:12.100 --> 00:41:16.540]   Have we become teachers before we really study?
[00:41:16.540 --> 00:41:22.500]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord, and again, in our weakness, ask the Lord.
[00:41:22.500 --> 00:41:24.860]   We believe, help our unbelief.
[00:41:24.860 --> 00:41:26.460]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship can lead us.
