[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:12.640]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:13.640 --> 00:29:16.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:29:39.640 --> 00:29:42.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:30:08.640 --> 00:30:11.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:30:11.800 --> 00:30:35.800]   (audience chattering)
[00:30:36.800 --> 00:30:39.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:03.800 --> 00:31:06.960]   (audience chattering)
[00:31:06.960 --> 00:31:24.960]   - Did you dye your hair?
[00:31:24.960 --> 00:31:25.960]   Oh, no, no.
[00:31:25.960 --> 00:31:31.800]   All right, if I can get your attention up here.
[00:31:32.800 --> 00:31:36.460]   We're gonna just kind of have a wrap-up session
[00:31:36.460 --> 00:31:38.700]   for these five verses,
[00:31:38.700 --> 00:31:42.560]   but I wanna just remind you of the context, okay?
[00:31:42.560 --> 00:31:44.840]   This is starting from verse one.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:46.660]   If you guys remember, chapters one and two,
[00:31:46.660 --> 00:31:49.340]   Paul's defending his apostleship,
[00:31:49.340 --> 00:31:51.760]   that his gospel is the gospel
[00:31:51.760 --> 00:31:54.000]   that he received directly from Jesus.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.160]   They didn't have the New Testament at this time,
[00:31:56.160 --> 00:31:58.360]   so his authority is everything,
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.560]   and so he's defending his apostleship.
[00:32:00.560 --> 00:32:02.900]   Chapters three and four, we're going into
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.860]   a lot of meaty theology of what it means
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:12.000]   to be justified by faith alone in Christ alone, okay?
[00:32:12.000 --> 00:32:13.760]   And in the beginning of this,
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:17.060]   he asks a bunch of just rhetorical questions,
[00:32:17.060 --> 00:32:18.900]   calling them, "Dude, you dummies.
[00:32:18.900 --> 00:32:20.700]   "You are bewitched.
[00:32:20.700 --> 00:32:23.760]   "You started with a clear understanding of the gospel,
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:26.000]   "but you're veering away from it," right?
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:28.160]   And we looked at, "Did you receive the Spirit
[00:32:28.160 --> 00:32:30.060]   "by the works of the law or by hearing of faith?
[00:32:30.060 --> 00:32:31.560]   "Have you been begun by the Spirit?
[00:32:31.560 --> 00:32:34.860]   "Are you now trying to become perfect in the flesh?
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.400]   "Does he who provides you with the Spirit
[00:32:37.400 --> 00:32:39.020]   "work miracles among you?
[00:32:39.020 --> 00:32:39.920]   "Do you do it by the works of the law
[00:32:39.920 --> 00:32:41.060]   "or by hearing of faith?"
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:43.620]   So the Spirit conversation has started
[00:32:43.620 --> 00:32:45.200]   in the beginning of chapter three,
[00:32:45.200 --> 00:32:48.020]   and it's cycling back around, right?
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:49.820]   The middle section that we looked at
[00:32:49.820 --> 00:32:52.060]   toward the end of last week was,
[00:32:52.060 --> 00:32:53.360]   Paul is quoting the Old Testament,
[00:32:53.360 --> 00:32:58.360]   because the Jews hold to Abraham as their spiritual father,
[00:32:59.200 --> 00:33:03.360]   and so Paul is specifying what the scriptures say
[00:33:03.360 --> 00:33:05.820]   about who the true sons of Abraham are
[00:33:05.820 --> 00:33:08.300]   and what the blessing given to Abraham is,
[00:33:08.300 --> 00:33:12.660]   and today we're looking at curses of God, blessings of God,
[00:33:12.660 --> 00:33:17.200]   and in this section, we have the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:19.500]   Right, so verse 13 and 14,
[00:33:19.500 --> 00:33:23.060]   you actually see the gospel, all right?
[00:33:23.060 --> 00:33:27.300]   So this is, I wanna just read this for you.
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.320]   "For as many as are of the works of the law
[00:33:30.320 --> 00:33:32.420]   "are under a curse, for it is written,
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:35.760]   "cursed is everyone who does not abide by all things
[00:33:35.760 --> 00:33:38.900]   "written in the book of the law to perform them.
[00:33:38.900 --> 00:33:42.300]   "Now that no one is justified by the laws
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:43.460]   "before God is evident,
[00:33:43.460 --> 00:33:46.500]   "for the righteous man shall live by faith.
[00:33:46.500 --> 00:33:49.300]   "However, the law is not of faith.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.020]   "On the contrary, he who practices them shall live by them."
[00:33:53.020 --> 00:33:55.820]   So he quotes two books from the law,
[00:33:55.820 --> 00:33:57.160]   two verses from the law,
[00:33:57.160 --> 00:34:00.380]   and then he quotes something from the prophets, okay?
[00:34:00.380 --> 00:34:03.820]   Verse 13, "Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[00:34:03.820 --> 00:34:06.380]   "having become a curse for us.
[00:34:06.380 --> 00:34:10.240]   "For it is written, cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,
[00:34:10.240 --> 00:34:12.100]   "in order that in Christ Jesus,
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.840]   "the blessings of Abraham might come to the Gentiles,
[00:34:14.840 --> 00:34:18.100]   "so that we would receive the promise of the Spirit
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:18.980]   "through faith."
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.180]   And so Paul is using the Old Testament
[00:34:24.300 --> 00:34:28.360]   really to unpack the truths of the gospel here, okay?
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:30.720]   In Acts 26, 19 to 23,
[00:34:30.720 --> 00:34:33.800]   I just felt that this would be helpful.
[00:34:33.800 --> 00:34:36.320]   This is Paul's defense before King Agrippa.
[00:34:36.320 --> 00:34:39.280]   "So, King Agrippa, I did not prove disobedient
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:40.260]   "to the heavenly vision,
[00:34:40.260 --> 00:34:44.260]   "but kept declaring both to those of Damascus first,
[00:34:44.260 --> 00:34:45.540]   "and also at Jerusalem,
[00:34:45.540 --> 00:34:47.580]   "and then throughout all the region of Judea,
[00:34:47.580 --> 00:34:48.980]   "and even to the Gentiles,
[00:34:48.980 --> 00:34:52.940]   "that they should repent and turn to God.
[00:34:52.940 --> 00:34:56.560]   "Performing deeds appropriate to repentance.
[00:34:56.560 --> 00:34:59.120]   "For this reason, some Jews seized me in the temple,
[00:34:59.120 --> 00:35:01.340]   "and tried to put me to death.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.660]   "So having obtained help from God,
[00:35:03.660 --> 00:35:05.320]   "I stand to this day,
[00:35:05.320 --> 00:35:07.680]   "testifying both to small and great,
[00:35:07.680 --> 00:35:11.760]   "stating nothing but what the prophets and Moses said
[00:35:11.760 --> 00:35:14.380]   "was going to take place.
[00:35:14.380 --> 00:35:16.240]   "The Christ was to suffer,
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:19.120]   "and that by the reason of his resurrection from the dead,
[00:35:19.120 --> 00:35:21.180]   "he would be the first to proclaim light,
[00:35:21.180 --> 00:35:24.260]   "both to the Jewish people, and to the Gentiles."
[00:35:24.260 --> 00:35:27.220]   So he's saying that God's message,
[00:35:27.220 --> 00:35:29.260]   all the way back from Genesis, Exodus,
[00:35:29.260 --> 00:35:31.060]   Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy,
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:33.380]   all the way through the prophets,
[00:35:33.380 --> 00:35:37.020]   to now has been consistently the same.
[00:35:37.020 --> 00:35:38.300]   It's always been by faith.
[00:35:38.300 --> 00:35:43.220]   The righteous shall live by faith, right?
[00:35:43.220 --> 00:35:44.620]   Abel lived by faith,
[00:35:44.620 --> 00:35:47.060]   and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.700]   Enoch walked with God by faith,
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:51.540]   and it was credited to him as righteousness.
[00:35:51.540 --> 00:35:54.800]   Abraham, who received the promise,
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:56.660]   his faith was reckoned to him as righteousness.
[00:35:56.660 --> 00:35:57.940]   So it's always been by faith,
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:01.300]   and Paul is gonna use, as he's in the habit of doing,
[00:36:01.300 --> 00:36:04.260]   Old Testament law and prophets
[00:36:04.260 --> 00:36:09.820]   to unpack the need for Jesus' arrival,
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:12.100]   his death, and resurrection, okay?
[00:36:12.100 --> 00:36:17.100]   And so what we're seeing in Galatians is his argument, okay?
[00:36:18.220 --> 00:36:23.220]   So for the Jew, in Paul's day,
[00:36:23.220 --> 00:36:27.540]   this was the typical understanding of blessing,
[00:36:27.540 --> 00:36:29.540]   and the understanding of curses, okay?
[00:36:29.540 --> 00:36:31.820]   And I wanted to walk you through that briefly,
[00:36:31.820 --> 00:36:33.540]   'cause that's gonna be helpful.
[00:36:33.540 --> 00:36:36.740]   The traditional Jewish understanding of blessing
[00:36:36.740 --> 00:36:39.900]   is if you are a descendant of Israel,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:44.500]   God has made a contract with his people,
[00:36:44.500 --> 00:36:49.500]   and there are blessings awaiting the people of Israel, okay?
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:53.260]   Those circumcised according to the Abrahamic covenant
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:56.300]   are living under that blessing.
[00:36:56.300 --> 00:37:03.060]   And law-keeping is not only the duty,
[00:37:03.060 --> 00:37:06.700]   but the privilege of living under that blessing.
[00:37:06.700 --> 00:37:08.380]   Now, they had various interpretations,
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:10.500]   because they didn't expect everybody
[00:37:10.500 --> 00:37:13.060]   to be able to really actually live
[00:37:13.060 --> 00:37:14.940]   according to the law perfectly.
[00:37:14.940 --> 00:37:20.200]   But if I'm a descendant of Abraham, I've been circumcised,
[00:37:20.200 --> 00:37:21.820]   if I'm a people of Israel,
[00:37:21.820 --> 00:37:24.020]   and I generally live according to the law,
[00:37:24.020 --> 00:37:25.700]   to the best of my ability,
[00:37:25.700 --> 00:37:29.940]   the promises are great nation, there's a renown,
[00:37:29.940 --> 00:37:32.340]   I'm gonna have inherent land,
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:34.540]   there are gonna be innumerable descendants,
[00:37:34.540 --> 00:37:36.800]   wealth, and victory over enemies.
[00:37:36.800 --> 00:37:40.940]   That was a typical Jewish understanding, okay?
[00:37:40.940 --> 00:37:43.980]   And this was a Jewish understanding of the curse,
[00:37:43.980 --> 00:37:45.860]   and obviously, we're looking at Galatians,
[00:37:45.860 --> 00:37:47.260]   they didn't get it right, right?
[00:37:47.260 --> 00:37:50.220]   But this is the understanding of the curse.
[00:37:50.220 --> 00:37:54.460]   Those outside of Abraham and Israel
[00:37:54.460 --> 00:37:57.180]   are gonna be under the curse, okay?
[00:37:57.180 --> 00:38:00.820]   Uncircumcised Gentiles are under a curse,
[00:38:00.820 --> 00:38:04.980]   and actually, the Leviticus 18.5 quote is in context
[00:38:04.980 --> 00:38:09.980]   of not having any interaction sexually with the Gentiles,
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:13.500]   that's in the context there, okay?
[00:38:13.500 --> 00:38:15.140]   So you're not supposed to mingle
[00:38:15.140 --> 00:38:16.740]   with the uncircumcised Gentiles,
[00:38:16.740 --> 00:38:19.020]   'cause they're under a curse.
[00:38:19.020 --> 00:38:24.020]   And lawbreakers are typically gonna be under a curse, okay?
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:27.180]   And so the Jewish people thought,
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:30.080]   basically, all of our enemies, God's gonna curse.
[00:38:30.080 --> 00:38:32.940]   That was part of the Abrahamic blessing, right?
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.700]   And I will bless those who bless you,
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:37.340]   and everyone who curses you, I will curse.
[00:38:37.340 --> 00:38:41.580]   And also, a lot of curses and a lot of doom
[00:38:41.580 --> 00:38:45.300]   awaits people who mess with the apple of God's eye,
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.180]   and that's the people of Israel.
[00:38:47.180 --> 00:38:49.420]   So even modern-day Jews will believe
[00:38:49.420 --> 00:38:54.420]   that if I am an ethnic Jew, God loves me, God favors me,
[00:38:54.420 --> 00:38:58.520]   I am going to inherit a blessing.
[00:38:58.520 --> 00:39:01.640]   That's the understanding, okay?
[00:39:01.640 --> 00:39:04.540]   And the Jews did their best to live
[00:39:04.540 --> 00:39:07.300]   according to certain laws and principles.
[00:39:07.300 --> 00:39:10.060]   And that's why, when we read earlier,
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:13.180]   when Paul is saying this,
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:15.900]   "We are Jews by nature,
[00:39:15.900 --> 00:39:18.780]   "and not sinners from among the Gentiles."
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:22.300]   So I wanna give you an example from the New Testament
[00:39:22.300 --> 00:39:27.100]   of a person who lived with this mindset, okay?
[00:39:27.100 --> 00:39:27.940]   Here we go.
[00:39:27.940 --> 00:39:32.020]   A ruler questioned him, saying,
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.500]   "Good teacher, what shall I do to inherit eternal life?"
[00:39:36.500 --> 00:39:39.560]   And Jesus said to him, "Why do you call me good?
[00:39:39.560 --> 00:39:41.960]   "No one is good except God alone.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:43.020]   "You know the commandments.
[00:39:43.020 --> 00:39:46.180]   "Do not commit adultery, do not murder, do not steal,
[00:39:46.180 --> 00:39:50.420]   "do not bear false witness, honor your father and mother."
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.500]   And the ruler, he said,
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:57.220]   "All these things I have kept from my youth."
[00:39:57.220 --> 00:39:58.980]   And he was probably very sincere.
[00:40:00.340 --> 00:40:03.400]   When Jesus heard this, he said to him,
[00:40:03.400 --> 00:40:06.320]   "Eh, one thing you still lack.
[00:40:06.320 --> 00:40:09.980]   "Sell all that you possess and distribute it to the poor,
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:12.160]   "and you shall have treasure in heaven,
[00:40:12.160 --> 00:40:13.800]   "and come follow me."
[00:40:13.800 --> 00:40:17.300]   But when the ruler, he had heard these things,
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:22.220]   he became very sad, for he was extremely rich.
[00:40:22.220 --> 00:40:26.020]   I wanna pause here.
[00:40:26.860 --> 00:40:28.620]   This rich, young ruler
[00:40:28.620 --> 00:40:34.300]   already saw himself being blessed by God,
[00:40:34.300 --> 00:40:37.800]   but there's something missing.
[00:40:37.800 --> 00:40:39.660]   So he's asking Jesus this question,
[00:40:39.660 --> 00:40:43.800]   and Jesus looks at him and says,
[00:40:43.800 --> 00:40:46.360]   "How hard it is for those who are wealthy
[00:40:46.360 --> 00:40:47.780]   "to enter the kingdom of God,
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:49.280]   "for it is easier for a camel
[00:40:49.280 --> 00:40:50.440]   "to go through the eye of a needle
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.380]   "than for a rich man to enter the kingdom of God.
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:56.660]   "And that they, the disciples who heard it said,
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:58.140]   "Then who can be saved?"
[00:40:58.140 --> 00:41:03.300]   But Jesus said, "Things that are impossible with people
[00:41:03.300 --> 00:41:04.700]   "are possible with God."
[00:41:04.700 --> 00:41:09.040]   And Peter said, "Behold, we have left our own homes
[00:41:09.040 --> 00:41:09.980]   "and followed you."
[00:41:09.980 --> 00:41:12.000]   So this is a very important question.
[00:41:12.000 --> 00:41:16.240]   If Jesus is looking at this ruler saying,
[00:41:16.240 --> 00:41:18.640]   "You're still lacking.
[00:41:18.640 --> 00:41:22.420]   "You're still lacking."
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:26.020]   And the rich, young ruler was probably very sincere
[00:41:26.020 --> 00:41:28.220]   in saying that, "I did all of these things."
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:32.780]   And Jesus says,
[00:41:32.780 --> 00:41:37.420]   "There are things that are impossible with people."
[00:41:37.420 --> 00:41:43.000]   Earning favor with God is impossible with people.
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.420]   It's possible with God.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.660]   And what the Jews didn't understand
[00:41:49.660 --> 00:41:52.900]   was that the promise giver who is God,
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:54.680]   and we're gonna be learning more about this
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:56.180]   in the next 15 verses,
[00:41:56.180 --> 00:42:00.420]   how holy he is and how much perfection
[00:42:00.420 --> 00:42:03.980]   he actually demanded in all who commit to observing the law.
[00:42:03.980 --> 00:42:10.520]   And James expounds on this and Jesus says
[00:42:10.520 --> 00:42:13.520]   something similar in Matthew 5:48,
[00:42:13.520 --> 00:42:15.380]   for whoever keeps the whole law
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:17.940]   and yet stumbles in one point,
[00:42:17.940 --> 00:42:19.820]   he has become guilty of all.
[00:42:19.820 --> 00:42:23.660]   Matthew 5:48, Jesus says,
[00:42:23.660 --> 00:42:26.860]   "Therefore, you are to be perfect
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.980]   "as your heavenly father is perfect."
[00:42:29.980 --> 00:42:32.280]   What does God demand?
[00:42:32.280 --> 00:42:39.420]   He is a thrice holy God, holy, holy, holy.
[00:42:39.420 --> 00:42:44.900]   And if you want to earn favor with God,
[00:42:44.900 --> 00:42:47.060]   what do you have to be?
[00:42:47.060 --> 00:42:52.860]   Completely unsentiented, perfect, right?
[00:42:53.820 --> 00:42:58.380]   If you transgress the law of God,
[00:42:58.380 --> 00:43:00.580]   even at the most minute point,
[00:43:00.580 --> 00:43:05.100]   there's one penalty, and what is that?
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:05.940]   Hell forever.
[00:43:05.940 --> 00:43:09.300]   So because of our pride,
[00:43:09.300 --> 00:43:10.740]   because of our limited understanding,
[00:43:10.740 --> 00:43:13.360]   this is very hard to swallow
[00:43:13.360 --> 00:43:16.520]   because in our minds, we have categories of sinners.
[00:43:16.520 --> 00:43:18.860]   We have the really wicked people,
[00:43:18.860 --> 00:43:21.180]   we have the pretty wicked people,
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:23.900]   we have the average Joe Schmo wicked people,
[00:43:23.900 --> 00:43:26.780]   we have a little bit less wicked persons over here,
[00:43:26.780 --> 00:43:28.600]   and then we have, ah, they're not perfect,
[00:43:28.600 --> 00:43:30.860]   but they're not that bad kind of people over here.
[00:43:30.860 --> 00:43:33.460]   And then you have people like Mother Teresa,
[00:43:33.460 --> 00:43:36.060]   who at least humanly,
[00:43:36.060 --> 00:43:38.460]   that's like one of the best humans you can have,
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:44.500]   but there is no one righteous, not even one.
[00:43:44.500 --> 00:43:46.140]   That's what Romans 3 says, right?
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:49.300]   And for those of us who are not righteous,
[00:43:49.300 --> 00:43:50.880]   who transgress the law of God,
[00:43:50.880 --> 00:43:52.480]   just even at one point,
[00:43:52.480 --> 00:43:55.180]   what's the deserved punishment?
[00:43:55.180 --> 00:43:57.540]   Hell forever.
[00:43:57.540 --> 00:44:00.540]   That's what the Bible teaches.
[00:44:00.540 --> 00:44:03.540]   And if there's something in you that cries out,
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:07.980]   "That's not fair," or, "No, it's not,"
[00:44:07.980 --> 00:44:11.160]   there's pride there that's resisting this truth,
[00:44:11.160 --> 00:44:14.060]   and there's an understanding of God that you do not have.
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:16.560]   Okay?
[00:44:16.560 --> 00:44:18.580]   There's a word called, there's a theological,
[00:44:18.580 --> 00:44:20.700]   have you guys ever heard of the word tulip?
[00:44:20.700 --> 00:44:22.900]   I mean, not the flower, but the acronym?
[00:44:22.900 --> 00:44:25.380]   But the T stands for total depravity.
[00:44:25.380 --> 00:44:28.980]   And one of the theologians I had to read
[00:44:28.980 --> 00:44:32.100]   when I was in seminary was a man named William Shedd.
[00:44:32.100 --> 00:44:34.900]   He says, "Total depravity means
[00:44:34.900 --> 00:44:37.760]   "the entire absence of holiness,
[00:44:37.760 --> 00:44:40.120]   "not the highest intensity of sin.
[00:44:40.120 --> 00:44:46.080]   "A totally depraved man is not as bad as he can be,
[00:44:46.080 --> 00:44:49.560]   "but he has no holiness,
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:53.200]   "and that is no supreme love of God.
[00:44:53.200 --> 00:44:56.660]   "So he is unable to be holy."
[00:44:56.660 --> 00:45:00.100]   That's our condition.
[00:45:00.100 --> 00:45:04.600]   You and I, in and of ourselves,
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:07.400]   who are born under the law,
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:09.920]   cursed because we're born under the law,
[00:45:09.920 --> 00:45:13.400]   we have no ability in and of ourselves
[00:45:13.400 --> 00:45:17.820]   to perform any holiness, is what the Bible is teaching.
[00:45:18.820 --> 00:45:22.620]   Are you guys tracking?
[00:45:22.620 --> 00:45:24.880]   And that's so offensive.
[00:45:24.880 --> 00:45:31.120]   And at this point, just every other religious person
[00:45:31.120 --> 00:45:33.220]   will reject Christianity,
[00:45:33.220 --> 00:45:35.720]   because every other religious system
[00:45:35.720 --> 00:45:39.160]   has some degree of merit, right?
[00:45:39.160 --> 00:45:43.840]   You can outrank somebody by merit in this religious system,
[00:45:46.220 --> 00:45:48.760]   but only the Christian faith says is,
[00:45:48.760 --> 00:45:53.760]   you and I, everybody has zero ability to be holy
[00:45:53.760 --> 00:45:55.640]   according to God's standards.
[00:45:55.640 --> 00:46:03.660]   And I use the mosquito, I bring back in the mosquito.
[00:46:03.660 --> 00:46:09.820]   What can a mosquito do to curry your favor?
[00:46:09.820 --> 00:46:14.760]   What if he brings you a newspaper every day?
[00:46:15.640 --> 00:46:19.080]   What if he checks your emails and responds to your emails?
[00:46:19.080 --> 00:46:21.000]   First of all, can a mosquito do that?
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:23.520]   No.
[00:46:23.520 --> 00:46:25.120]   How many of you guys would kill a mosquito
[00:46:25.120 --> 00:46:27.160]   without even asking a question?
[00:46:27.160 --> 00:46:28.000]   All of you.
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.740]   But remember, the distance between me and God
[00:46:32.740 --> 00:46:36.440]   is way bigger than the distance between me and a mosquito.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:39.240]   But I think because we don't fully understand
[00:46:39.240 --> 00:46:42.160]   how holy God is, there's something that's within us
[00:46:42.160 --> 00:46:44.120]   that cries that's not fair.
[00:46:44.120 --> 00:46:48.600]   And I was thinking of the song, Living Hope,
[00:46:48.600 --> 00:46:51.760]   how great the chasm that lay between us.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:55.960]   When you sing this, you're not even able
[00:46:55.960 --> 00:46:59.160]   to fully ponder that question.
[00:46:59.160 --> 00:47:00.360]   How great the chasm.
[00:47:00.360 --> 00:47:05.400]   'Cause we think it's reachable.
[00:47:05.400 --> 00:47:08.440]   If I pray hard enough, if I work hard enough,
[00:47:08.440 --> 00:47:09.760]   I can kind of reach it.
[00:47:11.440 --> 00:47:14.240]   How high the mountain I could not climb.
[00:47:14.240 --> 00:47:16.880]   The top of this mountain is over there in Pluto.
[00:47:16.880 --> 00:47:20.440]   Pluto's not a planet anymore, from what I understand.
[00:47:20.440 --> 00:47:25.160]   I can't even get to Everest without dying.
[00:47:25.160 --> 00:47:28.260]   Nor can most of you.
[00:47:28.260 --> 00:47:35.600]   But the gap between holy, holy, holy God
[00:47:35.600 --> 00:47:38.120]   and you and me is so vast
[00:47:39.440 --> 00:47:43.260]   that we cannot but be under a curse.
[00:47:43.260 --> 00:47:46.520]   And you wanna work against that?
[00:47:46.520 --> 00:47:51.500]   Good luck, because then you have to fulfill all of it.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:58.360]   So from our passage, it's divided into the top part,
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:00.040]   those are the curses.
[00:48:00.040 --> 00:48:02.640]   And I'm not gonna go into all the Old Testament passages
[00:48:02.640 --> 00:48:03.920]   that Paul quotes.
[00:48:03.920 --> 00:48:06.100]   Those are the curses.
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:10.460]   The bottom section is the statement of what we've received
[00:48:10.460 --> 00:48:12.700]   as blessed people.
[00:48:12.700 --> 00:48:14.780]   And the middle is the cost.
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:20.460]   Middle was the price paid for our redemption,
[00:48:20.460 --> 00:48:22.520]   for our liberty, for our freedom.
[00:48:22.520 --> 00:48:28.940]   So you have the curse, which every person is born under.
[00:48:28.940 --> 00:48:32.820]   You have the blessing, which is completely a gift of God.
[00:48:32.820 --> 00:48:34.720]   And in the middle, you have the means.
[00:48:35.720 --> 00:48:36.560]   Okay?
[00:48:36.560 --> 00:48:40.560]   And I wanna pause for the middle part.
[00:48:40.560 --> 00:48:41.920]   Christ redeemed us from the curse
[00:48:41.920 --> 00:48:43.920]   by becoming a curse for us.
[00:48:43.920 --> 00:48:47.320]   For it is written, "Cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree."
[00:48:47.320 --> 00:48:50.120]   And I wanna just focus on that passage briefly.
[00:48:50.120 --> 00:48:52.320]   If a man has committed a sin worthy of death
[00:48:52.320 --> 00:48:55.320]   and he is put to death and you hang him on a tree,
[00:48:55.320 --> 00:48:57.480]   his corpse shall not hang all night on the tree,
[00:48:57.480 --> 00:48:59.680]   but you shall surely bury him on the same day,
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:01.720]   for he is hanged, is a curse of God,
[00:49:01.720 --> 00:49:03.000]   so that you do not defile your land,
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:05.500]   which the Lord your God gives you as an inheritance.
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:10.540]   The person who is hung on a tree was already dead
[00:49:10.540 --> 00:49:12.100]   when you placed him on the tree.
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.040]   You guys see that?
[00:49:13.040 --> 00:49:16.740]   Usually it was through stoning.
[00:49:16.740 --> 00:49:19.860]   So if someone really did a sinful thing
[00:49:19.860 --> 00:49:22.240]   that defiled the land,
[00:49:22.240 --> 00:49:24.660]   and some of it was even like cursing your mom and dad,
[00:49:24.660 --> 00:49:27.320]   you got stoned to death, okay?
[00:49:27.320 --> 00:49:29.600]   That person was stoned,
[00:49:29.600 --> 00:49:32.000]   and if his offense was deemed so bad,
[00:49:32.000 --> 00:49:34.480]   they hung him on a tree as a warning.
[00:49:34.480 --> 00:49:38.720]   He isn't cursed by God because he is hung on a tree.
[00:49:38.720 --> 00:49:45.560]   He is hung on a tree to show a visual illustration
[00:49:45.560 --> 00:49:48.040]   of what it means to be rejected,
[00:49:48.040 --> 00:49:50.960]   not just from the community, but by God completely.
[00:49:50.960 --> 00:49:56.120]   And coincidentally, in the Roman times,
[00:49:56.120 --> 00:49:58.540]   they didn't just crucify ordinary people.
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.480]   They crucified the worst of the worst.
[00:50:00.480 --> 00:50:03.480]   (audience laughing)
[00:50:03.480 --> 00:50:08.600]   And I mentioned this passage last time,
[00:50:08.600 --> 00:50:11.180]   but I wanna actually just read this for you.
[00:50:11.180 --> 00:50:13.360]   Numbers 21, verses four through nine.
[00:50:13.360 --> 00:50:15.800]   Then they set out from Mount Hor by the way of the Red Sea
[00:50:15.800 --> 00:50:18.280]   to go around the land of Edom,
[00:50:18.280 --> 00:50:20.640]   and the people became impatient because of the journey.
[00:50:20.640 --> 00:50:22.280]   The people spoke against God and Moses.
[00:50:22.280 --> 00:50:23.960]   Why have you brought us up out of Egypt
[00:50:23.960 --> 00:50:25.040]   to die in the wilderness?
[00:50:25.040 --> 00:50:26.960]   So they didn't really trust in God, okay?
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:28.520]   There is no food, no water,
[00:50:28.520 --> 00:50:30.640]   and we loathe this miserable food.
[00:50:30.640 --> 00:50:32.280]   God is disappointing us.
[00:50:32.280 --> 00:50:33.640]   God is horrible.
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:35.400]   Why did you bring us out here?
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.120]   And so God sends discipline.
[00:50:37.120 --> 00:50:39.360]   The Lord sent fiery serpents among the people.
[00:50:39.360 --> 00:50:42.240]   They bit the people so that many people of Israel died.
[00:50:42.240 --> 00:50:44.560]   So the people came to Moses and said,
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:46.000]   we have sinned because we have spoken
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:47.240]   against the Lord and you.
[00:50:47.240 --> 00:50:49.200]   Intercede with the Lord that he may remove
[00:50:49.200 --> 00:50:50.480]   the serpents from us.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.660]   And Moses interceded for the people.
[00:50:52.660 --> 00:50:55.400]   Then the Lord said to Moses,
[00:50:55.400 --> 00:50:57.520]   make a fiery serpent and set it on a standard,
[00:50:57.520 --> 00:50:59.520]   and it shall come about that everyone who is bitten,
[00:50:59.520 --> 00:51:01.400]   when he looks at it, he will live.
[00:51:01.400 --> 00:51:04.560]   And Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on the standard,
[00:51:04.560 --> 00:51:06.400]   and it came about that if a serpent bit any man,
[00:51:06.400 --> 00:51:08.080]   when he looked at the bronze serpent, he lived.
[00:51:08.080 --> 00:51:09.980]   When you get snake-bitten,
[00:51:09.980 --> 00:51:12.560]   anybody snake-bitten before?
[00:51:12.560 --> 00:51:15.920]   Now praise God, nobody, right?
[00:51:15.920 --> 00:51:18.680]   But if you get bit by a venomous snake,
[00:51:18.680 --> 00:51:22.360]   there are kits, and what do those kits do?
[00:51:22.360 --> 00:51:25.720]   Extracts the blood.
[00:51:26.480 --> 00:51:31.480]   Moses is being told to do something absolutely absurd.
[00:51:31.480 --> 00:51:36.240]   If I've been bitten by a venomous snake,
[00:51:36.240 --> 00:51:39.080]   and I'm sick, and I'm about to die,
[00:51:39.080 --> 00:51:41.560]   all I have to do is look.
[00:51:41.560 --> 00:51:43.560]   Yes.
[00:51:43.560 --> 00:51:47.200]   Makes no sense.
[00:51:47.200 --> 00:51:51.040]   But what you're doing here is you're trusting
[00:51:51.040 --> 00:51:52.800]   that God is true to his word,
[00:51:52.800 --> 00:51:55.240]   and that's all that it'll take, and they lived.
[00:51:56.240 --> 00:51:59.040]   Now why is that important to today's passage?
[00:51:59.040 --> 00:52:02.600]   John 3, 14 to 21, and I'm gonna read the whole thing,
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.840]   'cause most of us only get stuck at 16, all right?
[00:52:05.840 --> 00:52:07.000]   But I wanna read this.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.200]   As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness,
[00:52:10.200 --> 00:52:13.020]   even so the Son of Man must be lifted up,
[00:52:13.020 --> 00:52:18.020]   so that whoever believes in him will have eternal life,
[00:52:18.020 --> 00:52:20.940]   not just an abundant, wealthy life here,
[00:52:20.940 --> 00:52:23.160]   but an eternal one, okay?
[00:52:23.160 --> 00:52:27.340]   For God in this way, the so is not the he loved you so.
[00:52:27.340 --> 00:52:32.760]   I've actually heard a pastor say this, and I cringed.
[00:52:32.760 --> 00:52:35.280]   That's not what that so means.
[00:52:35.280 --> 00:52:38.160]   That so means in this way, in this manner.
[00:52:38.160 --> 00:52:41.160]   For God in this way loved the world,
[00:52:41.160 --> 00:52:43.360]   that he gave his only begotten Son,
[00:52:43.360 --> 00:52:45.320]   that whoever believes in him,
[00:52:45.320 --> 00:52:51.620]   not work off your sin, not wash away the residue,
[00:52:51.640 --> 00:52:55.640]   just believe, will not perish, but have eternal life.
[00:52:55.640 --> 00:52:57.960]   For God did not send the Son into the world
[00:52:57.960 --> 00:52:58.800]   to judge the world,
[00:52:58.800 --> 00:53:01.520]   but that the world might be saved through him.
[00:53:01.520 --> 00:53:05.280]   He who believes in him is not judged.
[00:53:05.280 --> 00:53:09.600]   He who does not believe has been judged already,
[00:53:09.600 --> 00:53:13.040]   aka under a curse, because he has not believed
[00:53:13.040 --> 00:53:15.480]   in the name of the only begotten Son of God.
[00:53:15.480 --> 00:53:18.040]   This is the judgment, curse,
[00:53:18.040 --> 00:53:20.640]   that the light has come into the world,
[00:53:20.640 --> 00:53:23.000]   and men love the darkness rather than the light
[00:53:23.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   for their deeds were evil.
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.200]   For everyone who does evil hates the light
[00:53:28.200 --> 00:53:29.320]   and does not come to the light
[00:53:29.320 --> 00:53:31.440]   for fear that his deeds will be exposed,
[00:53:31.440 --> 00:53:34.920]   but he who practices the truth comes to the light
[00:53:34.920 --> 00:53:36.960]   so that his deeds may be manifested
[00:53:36.960 --> 00:53:41.040]   as having been wrought in God.
[00:53:41.040 --> 00:53:46.080]   Christ redeemed us from the curse of the law,
[00:53:46.080 --> 00:53:49.140]   having become a curse for us, for it is written,
[00:53:49.140 --> 00:53:51.320]   cursed is everyone who hangs on a tree,
[00:53:51.320 --> 00:53:55.040]   and the word redeemed means to be purchased.
[00:53:55.040 --> 00:53:58.920]   There was a transaction that was needed
[00:53:58.920 --> 00:54:03.600]   to be liberated and freed at a cost.
[00:54:03.600 --> 00:54:08.480]   You and I could not pay this cost.
[00:54:08.480 --> 00:54:12.160]   That's why Matthew 18, the parable of the king
[00:54:12.160 --> 00:54:14.200]   who's demanding an account,
[00:54:14.200 --> 00:54:15.880]   and then that's actually called the parable
[00:54:15.880 --> 00:54:18.360]   of the unforgiving servant, okay?
[00:54:18.360 --> 00:54:23.360]   But God forgives this servant of an unpayable amount.
[00:54:23.360 --> 00:54:26.200]   Let's say if someone were to say,
[00:54:26.200 --> 00:54:28.020]   you're gonna be in jail,
[00:54:28.020 --> 00:54:29.680]   your entire family's gonna be in jail
[00:54:29.680 --> 00:54:32.040]   until you're able to pay off $10 billion.
[00:54:32.040 --> 00:54:34.200]   Would you be able to pay it?
[00:54:34.200 --> 00:54:36.160]   If yes, come talk to me.
[00:54:36.160 --> 00:54:38.740]   We need a new church building, right?
[00:54:38.740 --> 00:54:42.000]   Nah, but that's an unpayable debt.
[00:54:42.000 --> 00:54:47.380]   But the redemption is it was paid for you,
[00:54:47.380 --> 00:54:48.520]   so you're free.
[00:54:48.520 --> 00:54:56.160]   In him, you also, after listening to the message
[00:54:56.160 --> 00:54:58.060]   of the truth, the gospel of your salvation,
[00:54:58.060 --> 00:55:02.520]   having also believed, you were sealed in him
[00:55:02.520 --> 00:55:05.180]   with the Holy Spirit of promise
[00:55:05.180 --> 00:55:09.160]   who is given as a pledge of our inheritance
[00:55:09.160 --> 00:55:11.160]   with a view to the redemption of God's own possession
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:12.600]   to the praise of his glory.
[00:55:12.600 --> 00:55:17.340]   The Holy Spirit is God's contractual signature
[00:55:17.340 --> 00:55:21.380]   on your life that no one can snatch you out of his hand,
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:24.740]   that you are his, his stamp is on you.
[00:55:24.740 --> 00:55:27.220]   Satan cannot touch you.
[00:55:27.220 --> 00:55:31.980]   And that you are guaranteed heaven.
[00:55:31.980 --> 00:55:41.060]   And what is this guarantee of?
[00:55:41.940 --> 00:55:44.160]   But God, being rich in mercy because of his great love
[00:55:44.160 --> 00:55:46.640]   with which he loved us, even when we were dead
[00:55:46.640 --> 00:55:49.280]   in our transgressions, made us alive together with Christ
[00:55:49.280 --> 00:55:50.920]   by grace you have been saved.
[00:55:50.920 --> 00:55:55.120]   And he raised us up with him and seated us with him
[00:55:55.120 --> 00:55:58.380]   in the heavenly places in Christ Jesus.
[00:55:58.380 --> 00:56:00.440]   And I wanna pause there.
[00:56:00.440 --> 00:56:03.920]   We're seated with Christ?
[00:56:03.920 --> 00:56:10.960]   We who are wretched worms,
[00:56:10.960 --> 00:56:13.840]   we're children of God and seated with Christ
[00:56:13.840 --> 00:56:15.320]   in the heavenly places?
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:16.220]   Why?
[00:56:16.220 --> 00:56:19.280]   So that forever and ever and ever
[00:56:19.280 --> 00:56:22.660]   he might show the surpassing riches of his grace
[00:56:22.660 --> 00:56:25.400]   in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.
[00:56:25.400 --> 00:56:27.860]   God will spend the rest of eternity
[00:56:27.860 --> 00:56:32.000]   being creatively, eternally kind to you.
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:38.060]   That's a long way you've come
[00:56:38.060 --> 00:56:41.180]   if you understand the depth of your depravity.
[00:56:41.180 --> 00:56:44.540]   So I have this question for you.
[00:56:44.540 --> 00:56:48.220]   Is the gospel good news to you
[00:56:48.220 --> 00:56:50.020]   or is it just religious information?
[00:56:50.020 --> 00:56:57.840]   If it is just religious information,
[00:56:57.840 --> 00:56:59.400]   it's because you don't understand
[00:56:59.400 --> 00:57:02.460]   the condemnation you actually deserve.
[00:57:02.460 --> 00:57:04.660]   It's because you and I don't understand
[00:57:07.160 --> 00:57:09.400]   the price it costs the Lord.
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.080]   It's because we don't understand
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:13.940]   what eternity in heaven with Christ Jesus will be like.
[00:57:13.940 --> 00:57:16.440]   And then it's just information.
[00:57:16.440 --> 00:57:19.520]   But is it good news to you?
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:24.660]   And that's why when Jesus says he who has forgiven much
[00:57:24.660 --> 00:57:27.840]   just naturally knows how to love much.
[00:57:27.840 --> 00:57:30.000]   'Cause we know that we're not entitled to anything.
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:31.760]   We don't deserve anything.
[00:57:31.760 --> 00:57:34.400]   So I'm gonna give you some information, okay?
[00:57:36.800 --> 00:57:38.720]   Malaria can give you fevers.
[00:57:38.720 --> 00:57:42.180]   Nod your heads if you believe that to be true.
[00:57:42.180 --> 00:57:46.820]   Great, you're wise.
[00:57:46.820 --> 00:57:49.820]   Shingles is a painful, itchy, blistery rash,
[00:57:49.820 --> 00:57:51.400]   among other things.
[00:57:51.400 --> 00:57:53.240]   Have you guys, have you had shingles?
[00:57:53.240 --> 00:57:55.960]   Nice.
[00:57:55.960 --> 00:57:58.040]   Mary, Mary Kim, she had shingles.
[00:57:58.040 --> 00:58:00.680]   Sorry. (laughs)
[00:58:00.680 --> 00:58:02.580]   You're never gonna raise your hand again.
[00:58:02.580 --> 00:58:04.120]   That's information.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.640]   Food poisoning is caused by bacteria, I learned,
[00:58:08.640 --> 00:58:09.840]   and sometimes viral.
[00:58:09.840 --> 00:58:12.560]   And it's unpleasant.
[00:58:12.560 --> 00:58:14.760]   Raise your hand if you've had food poisoning.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:16.280]   Okay.
[00:58:16.280 --> 00:58:17.120]   All right.
[00:58:17.120 --> 00:58:19.280]   That's information.
[00:58:19.280 --> 00:58:22.560]   And making it more personal to you,
[00:58:22.560 --> 00:58:25.800]   you don't have a cold.
[00:58:25.800 --> 00:58:28.400]   How many of you, this is true for you right now,
[00:58:28.400 --> 00:58:29.500]   you don't have a cold?
[00:58:29.500 --> 00:58:32.540]   Good news or just information?
[00:58:33.760 --> 00:58:35.760]   Well, it's good news.
[00:58:35.760 --> 00:58:37.400]   Are you excited about that?
[00:58:37.400 --> 00:58:41.080]   No, you're like, "Duh, I shouldn't have a cold, right?
[00:58:41.080 --> 00:58:42.600]   "I take my vitamin C."
[00:58:42.600 --> 00:58:44.240]   How about this?
[00:58:44.240 --> 00:58:47.300]   You have not contracted AIDS, guys!
[00:58:47.300 --> 00:58:49.640]   Is that information or is that good news?
[00:58:49.640 --> 00:58:56.980]   Well, it's good news,
[00:58:56.980 --> 00:59:00.380]   but it's impacted you very little,
[00:59:00.380 --> 00:59:03.240]   'cause that's not your expectation.
[00:59:03.520 --> 00:59:05.560]   (coughs)
[00:59:05.560 --> 00:59:07.200]   You are cancer-free!
[00:59:07.200 --> 00:59:10.320]   How many of you guys have ever heard that before?
[00:59:10.320 --> 00:59:13.200]   Let's say you are cancer-free.
[00:59:13.200 --> 00:59:15.000]   Is that a good, bad thing?
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:15.920]   Great thing!
[00:59:15.920 --> 00:59:20.480]   But for someone who's had cancer,
[00:59:20.480 --> 00:59:22.880]   being told after 15 months,
[00:59:22.880 --> 00:59:24.720]   you are cancer-free,
[00:59:24.720 --> 00:59:28.960]   so much so that possibly we don't need to do surgery.
[00:59:28.960 --> 00:59:32.040]   It was a wild day.
[00:59:32.040 --> 00:59:34.320]   My wife was in there, I was like, "What?
[00:59:34.320 --> 00:59:36.860]   "You might not need to take away 10 inches of your colon
[00:59:36.860 --> 00:59:39.280]   "and half your rectum because you're cancer-free!"
[00:59:39.280 --> 00:59:42.000]   So I called my, he used to be a Berean,
[00:59:42.000 --> 00:59:45.260]   I called him, he's the head of radiology in Bakersfield.
[00:59:45.260 --> 00:59:46.960]   He's like, "Since you're young,
[00:59:46.960 --> 00:59:48.780]   "you should still have the surgery to remove that,
[00:59:48.780 --> 00:59:52.180]   "because a lot of these cancer cells are microscopic
[00:59:52.180 --> 00:59:54.760]   "and you don't really know until you actually carve it out
[00:59:54.760 --> 00:59:58.540]   "and then see it under a microscope, so just do it."
[00:59:58.540 --> 01:00:00.820]   And so I did it, even though the surgeon said,
[01:00:00.820 --> 01:00:03.840]   "You possibly could do without."
[01:00:03.840 --> 01:00:06.340]   But how many cancer cells is too many cancer cells?
[01:00:06.340 --> 01:00:09.640]   That possibility?
[01:00:09.640 --> 01:00:10.460]   That one.
[01:00:10.460 --> 01:00:17.800]   To my wife, to me, you are cancer-free was exceptional news
[01:00:17.800 --> 01:00:22.760]   because I was cancer-us,
[01:00:22.760 --> 01:00:26.760]   and it could cost my kids to be deprived of their father,
[01:00:26.760 --> 01:00:28.820]   my wife to be deprived of her husband.
[01:00:28.820 --> 01:00:33.520]   So when I heard this, I was like, "That's good news."
[01:00:33.520 --> 01:00:36.840]   Even though it's temporary.
[01:00:36.840 --> 01:00:39.320]   For you, it's duh.
[01:00:39.320 --> 01:00:44.140]   But when we think about the gospel of Jesus Christ,
[01:00:44.140 --> 01:00:50.220]   if you understand the depths of your depravity,
[01:00:50.220 --> 01:00:52.360]   what you were facing,
[01:00:52.360 --> 01:00:56.440]   and that you are now redeemed from that,
[01:00:56.440 --> 01:01:00.020]   then that's exceptional news and you cannot contain it.
[01:01:00.020 --> 01:01:02.580]   You cannot go back to your old self.
[01:01:02.580 --> 01:01:05.580]   You're gonna live the rest of your life
[01:01:05.580 --> 01:01:07.540]   jumping and skipping and dancing
[01:01:07.540 --> 01:01:10.860]   and praising the name of the Lord who has redeemed you,
[01:01:10.860 --> 01:01:13.780]   not just for this life, but especially for the next.
[01:01:13.780 --> 01:01:20.620]   That's why Galatians 3:10-14 is supremely important
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:24.040]   to meditate upon 'cause that's your testimony.
[01:01:24.040 --> 01:01:25.860]   And some of you don't quite understand
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:29.540]   how cursed, actually all of us,
[01:01:29.540 --> 01:01:32.340]   are lacking in an understanding of how cursed we are
[01:01:32.340 --> 01:01:36.100]   because if we understood how bad the wrath of God
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:38.980]   was to be for us, we would understand
[01:01:38.980 --> 01:01:43.220]   how good the good news is.
[01:01:43.220 --> 01:01:45.620]   And then grace would be that much sweeter
[01:01:45.620 --> 01:01:48.500]   'cause then we understand that I've done nothing for this.
[01:01:48.500 --> 01:01:49.980]   It was just given to me as a gift.
[01:01:49.980 --> 01:01:51.900]   Why? would be the question that we would ask.
[01:01:51.900 --> 01:01:52.740]   Why?
[01:01:53.660 --> 01:01:57.000]   And the rest of my life, as a righteous person,
[01:01:57.000 --> 01:01:58.340]   I'm gonna live it by faith.
[01:01:58.340 --> 01:02:00.740]   I'm gonna walk in the Spirit.
[01:02:00.740 --> 01:02:05.660]   I'm gonna live as a free man, Galatians 4, 5, and 6.
[01:02:05.660 --> 01:02:10.220]   Is the gospel of Jesus Christ good news
[01:02:10.220 --> 01:02:11.520]   or is it just information?
[01:02:11.520 --> 01:02:16.340]   And if it's only information, study the curse.
[01:02:16.340 --> 01:02:18.700]   Study Deuteronomy, study Leviticus,
[01:02:18.700 --> 01:02:21.000]   see how holy, holy, holy God is.
[01:02:21.900 --> 01:02:23.780]   And then you'll realize there is no way
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:28.420]   anyone can earn their way into the presence of a holy God.
[01:02:28.420 --> 01:02:30.020]   There has to be sacrifice.
[01:02:30.020 --> 01:02:31.380]   There has to be death.
[01:02:31.380 --> 01:02:34.280]   There has to be a substitutionary atonement.
[01:02:34.280 --> 01:02:38.140]   Amen?
[01:02:38.140 --> 01:02:42.940]   So don't take the promise of the Spirit
[01:02:42.940 --> 01:02:46.980]   having been given to you, residing in you right now,
[01:02:46.980 --> 01:02:47.820]   for granted.
[01:02:47.820 --> 01:02:49.180]   May we not take that for granted.
[01:02:51.580 --> 01:02:53.540]   Here are some things that are happening.
[01:02:53.540 --> 01:02:56.380]   Oops.
[01:02:56.380 --> 01:03:00.060]   November 22nd, there is no thanksgiving.
[01:03:00.060 --> 01:03:01.180]   We don't have Bible study.
[01:03:01.180 --> 01:03:02.220]   I was actually supposed to put,
[01:03:02.220 --> 01:03:03.980]   we don't have Bible study, all right?
[01:03:03.980 --> 01:03:05.220]   So next week, don't come.
[01:03:05.220 --> 01:03:08.140]   Okay, well, you can come, just pray outside.
[01:03:08.140 --> 01:03:11.500]   Saturday, December 2nd, FAM245.
[01:03:11.500 --> 01:03:13.640]   Sunday, December 3rd, we have communion,
[01:03:13.640 --> 01:03:14.840]   just as a heads up.
[01:03:14.840 --> 01:03:17.900]   The Christmas parties, the BAM party was at four.
[01:03:17.900 --> 01:03:21.140]   I put down as four, but it's actually at 5.30.
[01:03:21.140 --> 01:03:24.180]   And then the ping pong tournament, New Year's Eve service,
[01:03:24.180 --> 01:03:25.860]   you're gonna keep hearing about it.
[01:03:25.860 --> 01:03:27.820]   The sign-ups are gonna come soon
[01:03:27.820 --> 01:03:29.740]   for the ping pong tournament.
[01:03:29.740 --> 01:03:33.180]   And the Galatians study starts on February 7th.
[01:03:33.180 --> 01:03:37.540]   But if you guys can, do this right now, please.
[01:03:37.540 --> 01:03:40.220]   Click on this and sign up for the Bible study.
[01:03:40.220 --> 01:03:43.700]   And I'm gonna give you a good minute.
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:49.500]   'Cause it really is a hassle trying to track you down.
[01:03:49.500 --> 01:03:53.660]   (audience member speaking faintly)
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:54.620]   Does it work?
[01:03:54.620 --> 01:03:56.780]   Okay.
[01:03:56.780 --> 01:03:59.780]   Someone give me a...
[01:03:59.780 --> 01:04:12.980]   Okay, and while you're gonna go ahead and do that.
[01:04:12.980 --> 01:04:18.420]   This is for the November 29th.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:20.780]   2023 is almost over.
[01:04:20.780 --> 01:04:23.700]   We got three Bible study sessions left.
[01:04:23.700 --> 01:04:26.660]   The next one is November 29th, and it's four verses.
[01:04:26.660 --> 01:04:28.980]   Galatians 3, 15 to 18.
[01:04:28.980 --> 01:04:31.900]   The first question is,
[01:04:31.900 --> 01:04:34.740]   what were the promises spoken to Abraham and to his seed?
[01:04:34.740 --> 01:04:38.880]   What was the covenant previously ratified by God?
[01:04:38.880 --> 01:04:40.180]   How did he ratify it?
[01:04:40.180 --> 01:04:42.460]   And what were the contents of the inheritance?
[01:04:42.460 --> 01:04:44.380]   Who are the heirs?
[01:04:44.380 --> 01:04:48.040]   So the language is gonna be a little bit more complex.
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:49.780]   The grammar's gonna be a little bit more complex,
[01:04:49.780 --> 01:04:53.520]   so slow it down and try to dive in as deeply as you can.
[01:04:53.520 --> 01:04:59.020]   That's for the next, that's two weeks from today.
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:01.140]   But today, in your discussion,
[01:05:01.140 --> 01:05:02.540]   this is what I would like you guys
[01:05:02.540 --> 01:05:05.380]   to just really think through and pray together over.
[01:05:05.380 --> 01:05:09.340]   Question number one, if you are a Christian,
[01:05:09.340 --> 01:05:10.180]   this applies to you.
[01:05:10.180 --> 01:05:12.780]   If you're not, you're not set free from the law.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:15.380]   As one set free from the law,
[01:05:15.380 --> 01:05:19.740]   what does living by faith look like in your life?
[01:05:19.740 --> 01:05:21.840]   And stay away from the hypothetical,
[01:05:21.840 --> 01:05:23.840]   stay away from the generalizations.
[01:05:23.840 --> 01:05:26.240]   What does this look like right now in your life?
[01:05:26.240 --> 01:05:28.840]   And if you need help, you can ask the other people
[01:05:28.840 --> 01:05:30.960]   around you, am I walking by faith?
[01:05:30.960 --> 01:05:34.280]   Can you be as honest as you can with me?
[01:05:34.280 --> 01:05:37.340]   Do I, am I living like a person living by faith?
[01:05:37.340 --> 01:05:41.360]   Number two, in what ways do your life,
[01:05:41.360 --> 01:05:43.880]   attitudes, pursuits, and passions
[01:05:43.880 --> 01:05:46.580]   demonstrate that the gospel truly is good news?
[01:05:46.580 --> 01:05:51.500]   These aren't supposed to be like, yes, no.
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.900]   These are really supposed to cause you to reflect
[01:05:53.900 --> 01:05:55.780]   and seek some degree of application.
[01:05:55.780 --> 01:05:58.540]   Question number three, how can your group members
[01:05:58.540 --> 01:06:01.420]   come alongside you and help you to steadily
[01:06:01.420 --> 01:06:03.560]   walk and step with the spirit?
[01:06:03.560 --> 01:06:06.820]   And those are the, 'cause if you are a believer,
[01:06:06.820 --> 01:06:08.420]   you have the spirit in you.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:11.680]   You've received it, him.
[01:06:12.680 --> 01:06:17.420]   And you need to walk in step, okay?
[01:06:17.420 --> 01:06:22.420]   So how can your friends benefit you
[01:06:22.420 --> 01:06:24.020]   and intercede on your behalf?
[01:06:24.020 --> 01:06:25.500]   And then any prayer requests that come from
[01:06:25.500 --> 01:06:27.180]   questions number one through three.
[01:06:27.180 --> 01:06:29.620]   All right, let me pray for us, and then we'll dismiss.
[01:06:29.620 --> 01:06:34.100]   Father, I pray that you would just cause us, really,
[01:06:34.100 --> 01:06:36.940]   to reflect deeply on what we've been saved from
[01:06:36.940 --> 01:06:41.100]   so that we would more thoroughly enjoy
[01:06:41.100 --> 01:06:44.260]   and revel in what we've been saved for
[01:06:44.260 --> 01:06:46.500]   and what we've been saved to.
[01:06:46.500 --> 01:06:49.320]   So help us to really reflect deeply.
[01:06:49.320 --> 01:06:54.740]   And help us, Lord God, to live according
[01:06:54.740 --> 01:06:56.740]   to what pleases you most.
[01:06:56.740 --> 01:07:00.500]   We thank you, Lord, for your generosity
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:01.660]   and for your kindness.
[01:07:01.660 --> 01:07:03.620]   We can't repay it.
[01:07:03.620 --> 01:07:08.780]   So we pray that we would all just live our lives
[01:07:08.780 --> 01:07:13.140]   as living sacrifices, just in worship.
[01:07:13.140 --> 01:07:17.020]   May you receive the glory in our lives.
[01:07:17.020 --> 01:07:18.180]   And Jesus, let me pray.
