[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.600]   Let me pray for us and then we'll start.
[00:00:11.600 --> 00:00:16.320]   Gracious Father, I want to thank you for watching over our church just even the last three days,
[00:00:16.320 --> 00:00:22.240]   Lord God, as through various works and studies, you've sustained us.
[00:00:22.240 --> 00:00:26.960]   And we thank you, Father God, that even just day to day, just your Holy Spirit and your
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.920]   word just guiding and leading. And we know, Father, that just even in the mundane things, Lord,
[00:00:31.920 --> 00:00:36.960]   how you are always gracious to us. Help us to open our eyes to see the blessing that we live under,
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:41.120]   so that our hearts may not be filled with grumbling, but always thankful, Lord, for the
[00:00:41.120 --> 00:00:46.880]   salvation that you've given. Help us to glean from your word and to be sober and alert that each one
[00:00:46.880 --> 00:00:51.680]   of these things that we are learning, Father, would cause us to have a greater insight of who you are
[00:00:51.680 --> 00:00:56.480]   and the spiritual struggle, Lord, that is constantly going on. So we pray for your anointing.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:02.160]   We pray for your blessing in Jesus name we pray. Amen. All right. So this is a quick review. Just
[00:01:02.160 --> 00:01:07.760]   starting last week, we talked about how chapter 11 ends with the seventh trumpet and there is a
[00:01:07.760 --> 00:01:15.040]   a it's not a pause, but chapter 12 through 15. It kind of gives us a setup for the real severe
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:20.320]   judgment that's coming in chapter 16, the bold judgments. So the bold judgments are the most
[00:01:20.320 --> 00:01:30.080]   severest out of the seven different segments of judgments that we've had. In chapter 10 and 11,
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.240]   it talks about the three woes. The two woes have already been spoken and the worst of the three
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:42.080]   woes is waiting for us in chapter 16. So chapter 12, 13, 14, and 15 is kind of a setup to explain
[00:01:42.080 --> 00:01:49.440]   all that's going to happen in chapter 16. So is chapter 12 through 14, 15, was that meant to be
[00:01:49.440 --> 00:01:54.720]   taken completely chronologically? Is it kind of telling us chapter 12 happened, chapter 13 happened,
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:02:00.960]   chapter 14 happened? Is that how we're supposed to read that? No, we talked about that last week.
[00:02:00.960 --> 00:02:06.640]   Okay, so it's not what's happening, what's unraveling for us is talking about human history,
[00:02:06.640 --> 00:02:11.040]   redemptive history as a whole. So there are some elements of it that's talking about the future.
[00:02:11.040 --> 00:02:15.040]   There's some elements that's talking about the creation and the fall. There's some elements
[00:02:15.040 --> 00:02:20.080]   about Israel's history. So when you read it, you can't just simply read it chronologically.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:24.320]   You understand? Okay, so if you try to read it chronologically, it's not going to make sense
[00:02:24.320 --> 00:02:28.400]   because it's just not going to fit. So it's not meant to be read that way. In fact, as we study
[00:02:28.400 --> 00:02:32.240]   it, you're going to see what I'm saying if you don't know what I'm saying now. Okay, so chapter
[00:02:32.240 --> 00:02:38.240]   12, the setup was this conflict between this woman and the dragon. Who do we say the woman was?
[00:02:38.240 --> 00:02:43.520]   Yeah, most likely talking about Israel. There's certain language there
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:48.880]   that probably it's not. In fact, most commentators don't believe that this is talking about Mary.
[00:02:48.880 --> 00:02:53.600]   It's talking about probably, again, it's not 100%, but an educated guess as it's
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:58.800]   referenced to Israel giving birth to the Messiah. So the Messiah clearly is Jesus,
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:03:01.680]   right? So the conflict is between Jesus and who?
[00:03:01.680 --> 00:03:08.640]   The dragon, right? And who's the dragon?
[00:03:11.200 --> 00:03:12.800]   Is the dragon the Antichrist?
[00:03:12.800 --> 00:03:22.720]   Some response. Is the dragon the Antichrist? No, he's not the Antichrist. Who is the dragon?
[00:03:22.720 --> 00:03:32.720]   Satan himself, right? So he's the dragon is Satan himself. So we learned last week that Satan,
[00:03:32.720 --> 00:03:37.200]   because of his rebellion against God, he gets kicked out of heaven. He takes a third of the
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:43.040]   stars with him and the stars represent what? The angels. So the fallen angels, a third of them are
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:49.520]   taken with him. And then there is this conflict between the dragon and his angels and who else?
[00:03:49.520 --> 00:03:58.000]   Archangel Michael, right? Archangel Michael and the other angels versus the dragon and his angels.
[00:03:58.000 --> 00:04:05.680]   And this conflict happens, right? And Archangel Michael wins. So this is not like, oh, this is
[00:04:05.680 --> 00:04:10.160]   what happened. And so therefore, you know, this is when this happened. So you can't read it like
[00:04:10.160 --> 00:04:15.120]   that. This is just kind of telling us in redemptive history in totality that this is what's happening.
[00:04:15.120 --> 00:04:22.320]   So we go to chapter 13 and he's referring to two separate beasts, right? And so we're going to find
[00:04:22.320 --> 00:04:27.840]   out the identity of these beasts and who they are and what they are doing and what purpose they serve.
[00:04:27.840 --> 00:04:33.280]   And hopefully we'll gain some insight as to what is happening here. Okay. So let's look at the
[00:04:33.280 --> 00:04:51.600]   first one, the first beast. All right. So the first beast, the identity of the first beast.
[00:04:51.600 --> 00:04:58.640]   First, we want to clarify that the beast is not the dragon, but a servant of the dragon, right?
[00:04:59.360 --> 00:05:03.520]   The beast is not the dragon, but the servant of the dragon. In verse four, it says, and they
[00:05:03.520 --> 00:05:08.480]   worship the dragon for he had given authority to the beast. So they're distinct, right?
[00:05:08.480 --> 00:05:17.440]   So the beast and a dragon are two separate entities. The first beast represents a person
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:23.200]   and it is also symbolic of a demonic kingdom. So if you look at the language, there's clear
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:30.480]   reference to the beast as being an individual, a particular person. But if you look at the details
[00:05:30.480 --> 00:05:35.040]   of this description, he's talking about the 10 horns and seven heads, all in reference to authority.
[00:05:35.040 --> 00:05:43.840]   It is also symbolic of a kingdom. So the reference to the beast is in reference to his kingdom
[00:05:43.840 --> 00:05:49.200]   and the personhood, both at the same time. And it's hard to separate the two.
[00:05:52.480 --> 00:05:58.560]   The first piece is most likely in reference to what we often call the Antichrist, mentioned in
[00:05:58.560 --> 00:06:03.360]   other places in the Bible. I didn't mention it here, but in the Old Testament, there are passages
[00:06:03.360 --> 00:06:09.600]   where they called son of Belial or daughter of Belial or Belial himself. And the reference to
[00:06:09.600 --> 00:06:15.680]   Belial oftentimes is in reference to or similar in reference to the Antichrist in the New Testament.
[00:06:15.680 --> 00:06:22.640]   I think I have some. So the various verses, and I could have chosen a bunch of them, but these are
[00:06:22.640 --> 00:06:28.640]   some of the verses that we have in 1 John 2, 18 says, "Children, it is the last hour. And as you
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:33.520]   have heard that Antichrist is coming, so now many Antichrists have come. Therefore, we know that it
[00:06:33.520 --> 00:06:40.320]   is the last hour." So in John, he talks about Antichrist is coming, but many Antichrist has
[00:06:40.320 --> 00:06:46.400]   already come. So the spirit of the Antichrist has already come, but there's a particular Antichrist,
[00:06:46.400 --> 00:06:53.520]   the person himself. He hasn't fully been revealed, but the work of Antichrist through his
[00:06:53.520 --> 00:06:56.800]   minions, it has already started from the time of Christ.
[00:06:56.800 --> 00:07:04.800]   "Who is the liar, but he who denies that Jesus Christ, Jesus is the Christ. This is the Antichrist,
[00:07:04.800 --> 00:07:11.280]   he who denies the Father and the Son." Again, the work of Antichrist is not simply at the end,
[00:07:11.280 --> 00:07:20.080]   it's already started. "Every spirit that does not confess Jesus is not from God. This is the spirit
[00:07:20.080 --> 00:07:25.200]   of the Antichrist, which you heard was coming and now is in the world already." So in the early
[00:07:25.200 --> 00:07:32.560]   church, clearly from John's writings and Paul's writings and other epistles, that part of the
[00:07:32.560 --> 00:07:37.280]   early church teaching was about the coming of Antichrist. So we typically think, you know,
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:42.800]   when Paul and Peter and John, when they went and preached the gospel, you know, they taught about
[00:07:42.800 --> 00:07:47.840]   Christ, his identity, his death, his resurrection, and the church, and those are the main doctrines
[00:07:47.840 --> 00:07:52.880]   that we typically think that they probably spent 99% of the time talking about. But if you read
[00:07:52.880 --> 00:08:00.240]   the epistles carefully, you find that the talk of the end times was actually a very vital part
[00:08:00.240 --> 00:08:06.720]   of the gospel spreading. So remember when Paul went to Thessalonica, he was only there for about
[00:08:06.720 --> 00:08:13.200]   three Sundays, possibly a little bit longer than that, but during that period, a big chunk of his
[00:08:13.200 --> 00:08:17.760]   teaching was about the end times. So if you remember in 2 Thessalonians, he's talking about,
[00:08:17.760 --> 00:08:21.760]   "Remember when I told you that the man of lawlessness is going to come?" So the three
[00:08:21.760 --> 00:08:27.600]   short period weeks that he had, one of the main part of his teaching was about coming of the
[00:08:27.600 --> 00:08:32.240]   Antichrist, and that's why he says, "Remember when I was with you, I taught you about these things."
[00:08:32.240 --> 00:08:37.920]   So again, it's a reminder to us just how significant and important is this to our
[00:08:37.920 --> 00:08:44.320]   spiritual life, that from the very get-go that this was part of the teaching in the early church,
[00:08:44.320 --> 00:08:49.200]   right? So they spread the gospel, but along with spreading the gospel, there was teaching about
[00:08:49.200 --> 00:08:55.280]   the spiritual warfare and Antichrist and what he's doing, right? Which makes sense. If you have
[00:08:55.280 --> 00:09:02.880]   spiritual children and you have demonic forces who are actively working to scheme and to destroy
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:07.440]   the church, you want to make sure that at least they know about it, they hear about it, and that's
[00:09:07.440 --> 00:09:15.600]   exactly what Paul does. Paul and the other apostles do. Second, John verse 7, "For many deceivers have
[00:09:15.600 --> 00:09:19.840]   gone out into the world, those who do not confess the coming of Jesus Christ in the flesh. Such a
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:25.520]   one is a deceiver and the Antichrist." So again, most of these, if not all of these passages,
[00:09:25.520 --> 00:09:31.120]   are about 1 John and 2 John, but we see teachings of this in Christ's teaching in the book of
[00:09:31.120 --> 00:09:38.160]   Matthew. We see this in Paul's writings in 1 and 2 Thessalonians. We see it in Peter's writing.
[00:09:38.160 --> 00:09:44.400]   So it is not just John's writings, even though those are the verses I've chosen to pick, right?
[00:09:44.400 --> 00:09:52.720]   So the idea or the teaching about being careful or being watchful about the coming of the Antichrist
[00:09:52.720 --> 00:09:55.280]   was a vital part of the early church teaching.
[00:09:55.280 --> 00:10:07.040]   B, description of the beast. The identity of the beast clearly is the Antichrist. So he's a servant
[00:10:07.040 --> 00:10:13.680]   of Satan, right? Description, how is he described in this passage? In contrast to the second beast,
[00:10:14.240 --> 00:10:19.760]   that rises out of the earth, the first beast rises out of the sea, right? The significance
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:25.440]   of this, again, this is an educated guess and I think this was the best explanation that I read
[00:10:25.440 --> 00:10:32.400]   in the commentaries, is that the contrast may be stating that the first beast is coming out of the
[00:10:32.400 --> 00:10:43.920]   sea and the second beast is coming out of where? The earth. And the contrast between the two is
[00:10:43.920 --> 00:10:47.680]   that the first is the Antichrist and we're going to talk a little bit more when we get to the second
[00:10:47.680 --> 00:10:53.840]   beast. The second beast is obviously distinct from the first beast, right? And the second beast
[00:10:53.840 --> 00:11:01.680]   is, it serves the, the second beast serves the first beast, okay? We're going to get to that
[00:11:01.680 --> 00:11:09.840]   when we get to the second beast, okay? So the more significant work is Satan is above the first beast
[00:11:09.840 --> 00:11:16.560]   and the first beast is above the second beast. I'm getting confused, okay? Let me say that again.
[00:11:16.560 --> 00:11:24.000]   Satan is, is the top, under him the servant is the Antichrist, the first beast, and then the second
[00:11:24.000 --> 00:11:32.320]   beast serves the first beast. You get that? Okay? So here he identifies and says that the first beast
[00:11:32.320 --> 00:11:37.680]   is coming out of the sea and then later on if you read the, the coming of the second beast in verse
[00:11:37.680 --> 00:11:43.840]   11 he says he's coming out from the earth and the best explanation I heard from that was to come out
[00:11:43.840 --> 00:11:50.400]   of the sea meaning that it came from a distant place, right? Coming up from, from under the earth
[00:11:50.400 --> 00:11:55.840]   meaning that he was in their midst and I'm going to explain that when we get to the second beast.
[00:11:55.840 --> 00:12:03.280]   So the Antichrist is coming where they don't expect him. He's not in their midst. That the Antichrist,
[00:12:03.280 --> 00:12:08.560]   not the spirit of the Antichrist, but the, the Antichrist is going to come from somewhere else.
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:15.280]   It's going to come from afar, right? But the second beast is, which I'm going to explain a little bit
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:23.120]   later, is probably in reference to false, false prophets or maybe a false prophet and he's going
[00:12:23.120 --> 00:12:28.480]   to be in the midst of them and I'll, again I'll explain a little bit later. So that's the distinction
[00:12:28.480 --> 00:12:34.480]   between the first beast coming out of the sea and the second beast coming from the earth. Follow?
[00:12:34.480 --> 00:12:39.440]   Okay, so if you read it hopefully you know what I'm referencing to.
[00:12:39.440 --> 00:12:45.040]   It's pretty clear that the beast is mimicking the dragon.
[00:12:45.040 --> 00:12:52.480]   Even in his description it says he has 10 horns and 7 heads, right? Where did we see that before?
[00:12:55.040 --> 00:13:00.800]   The red dragon, right? In chapter 11 says he has 10, 10 horns and 7 heads. All of this in
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:08.880]   reference to his authority, right? The dragon gives the beast his power,
[00:13:08.880 --> 00:13:15.840]   throne and authority over the nation. So in verse 4, so there's clear hierarchy, right? You have,
[00:13:15.840 --> 00:13:22.160]   you have Satan and then the Antichrist and Antichrist is carrying out the work of the dragon,
[00:13:23.200 --> 00:13:31.680]   okay? This is all going to make sense, more sense later. It says that he has a blasphemous name
[00:13:31.680 --> 00:13:38.800]   written on his head in verse 1 and I saw the beast rising out of the sea and 10 horns and 7 heads
[00:13:38.800 --> 00:13:46.480]   with 10 diadems on his horns and blasphemous names on his head, right? So basically blasphemy
[00:13:46.480 --> 00:13:52.320]   is anything that is defaming by word or action against the name of God. That's the official
[00:13:52.320 --> 00:13:59.120]   definition of blasphemy. So blasphemy can be by action, blasphemy can be by words, right?
[00:13:59.120 --> 00:14:06.480]   But at the core of blasphemy is something that's opposing God and it's directly opposing God,
[00:14:06.480 --> 00:14:10.720]   right? So can I blaspheme against you?
[00:14:10.720 --> 00:14:18.640]   Technically no because you're not God, right? I can make fun of you, I can rip on you but I
[00:14:18.640 --> 00:14:24.480]   can't blaspheme against you because specifically blasphemy is in reference to opposing God, right?
[00:14:24.480 --> 00:14:34.880]   So the heads represents authority or power so that so these powers exist to oppose God. So the
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:41.280]   identity of this Antichrist, just like the word says, is to go against Christ. His whole purpose
[00:14:41.280 --> 00:14:47.360]   is to go against Christ. Even it's even written on his forehead, blasphemy against God, right?
[00:14:48.320 --> 00:14:54.480]   His whole intent, purpose, existence is to oppose God and his work.
[00:14:54.480 --> 00:15:03.600]   He is described physically as a leopard with feet like a bear and a mouth like a lion.
[00:15:03.600 --> 00:15:10.240]   Now we see the same vision that John sees here in the book of Daniel. I'm going to
[00:15:10.880 --> 00:15:19.520]   take us to that passage, right? So Daniel chapter 7 through to 7, the same description of this beast
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:27.600]   is recorded in this about the end times. Here there's four but the leopard, the bear, and the
[00:15:27.600 --> 00:15:33.680]   lion are also mentioned here, okay? Some of you guys may remember this from King Nebuchadnezzar's
[00:15:33.680 --> 00:15:41.120]   vision and he sees these four beasts, right? He sees the he begins with the lion and then the bear
[00:15:41.120 --> 00:15:47.040]   and then the leopard, right? So let me read it real quick. "And four great beasts came up out
[00:15:47.040 --> 00:15:51.680]   of the sea different from one another. The first was like a lion and had eagle's wings. Then as it
[00:15:51.680 --> 00:15:56.320]   looked its wings were plucked off and it was lifted up from the ground and made to stand on
[00:15:56.320 --> 00:16:01.120]   two feet like a man and the mind of a man was given to it. And behold another beast, a second
[00:16:01.120 --> 00:16:05.760]   one like a bear, it was raised up on one side. It had three ribs in its mouth between its teeth and
[00:16:05.760 --> 00:16:10.960]   it was told arise devour much flesh. After this I looked and behold another like a leopard with
[00:16:10.960 --> 00:16:16.000]   four wings of a bird on its back and a beast had four heads and dominion was given to it.
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:21.760]   And this I saw in the night visions and behold a fourth beast terrifying and dreadful and
[00:16:21.760 --> 00:16:27.600]   succeedingly strong. It had great iron teeth. It devoured and broke in pieces stamped what
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:32.800]   was left with his feet. It was different from all the beasts that were before it and it had 10 horns."
[00:16:32.800 --> 00:16:41.040]   Okay so he sees this vision of these four beasts and each one devoured each one consecutively
[00:16:41.040 --> 00:16:47.120]   and then the fourth one devours all of them. Okay now some of you guys may or may not have if you
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:55.120]   have ever studied the book of Daniel. One of the interpretations of this is in this is in reference
[00:16:55.120 --> 00:17:01.680]   to the four different kingdoms during the time of Israel's history before the coming of Christ.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:10.480]   Right so typically this is interpreted as the lion being the Babylonians
[00:17:10.480 --> 00:17:18.000]   and then the bears being the Persians and then the leopards being the Greeks.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:26.640]   And then the fourth would be what? The fourth one that devours all of them.
[00:17:26.640 --> 00:17:29.360]   What comes after the Greeks?
[00:17:29.360 --> 00:17:39.200]   Huh? Romans. Okay so the Roman Empire. So again whether that's true or not that's typically how
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:45.280]   this you know in some circles how this is interpreted. Whether it is or it is not we see
[00:17:45.280 --> 00:17:50.560]   again this is where the revelation so John's vision of this beast is not new.
[00:17:50.560 --> 00:17:56.880]   This is a vision that Daniel also saw about the end times. Okay let me go back.
[00:17:56.880 --> 00:18:13.280]   Okay and here's where things get interesting. Okay I asked you last week that it wasn't
[00:18:13.280 --> 00:18:21.520]   one of your questions but to try to find how much of the satanic work mimics Christ's work.
[00:18:21.520 --> 00:18:27.920]   Right remember me asking you that? It wasn't on your paper but I asked you that. I asked you to
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:34.640]   look for you know whatever you see in this chapter that looks or sounds similar to the work of Christ.
[00:18:34.640 --> 00:18:39.440]   Well if you took some time to read through it you should have found a bunch of them
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:45.760]   because so much of what's happening in chapter 13 is mimicking the work of Christ and this is
[00:18:45.760 --> 00:18:51.200]   where we begin. So first of all it says one of the seven heads seemed to have mortal wounds.
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:57.120]   It doesn't say it died it said it seemed to have mortal wounds but it's healed. This miraculous
[00:18:57.120 --> 00:19:02.400]   healing caused people to be amazed and then they end up following him and then worshiping him giving
[00:19:02.400 --> 00:19:10.720]   homage and honor right. What does that kind of remind you of?
[00:19:10.720 --> 00:19:20.560]   Here's this anti-Christ
[00:19:23.360 --> 00:19:32.720]   and he they think he has mortal wound but he gets miraculously healed basically comes back from the
[00:19:32.720 --> 00:19:39.760]   dead and so people are amazed by this miracle and as a result of that he gets a huge following.
[00:19:39.760 --> 00:19:49.360]   What does that sound like? Christ his death and resurrection right that he he dies then after
[00:19:49.360 --> 00:19:52.880]   three days he resurrects and people are amazed by the resurrection and that's the beginning of
[00:19:52.880 --> 00:20:02.720]   Christianity. So this anti-Christ is mimicking what Christ is doing right. So the mortal wound
[00:20:02.720 --> 00:20:08.880]   and his healing seems to be a mimic of his death and resurrection right. Turn your bibles I have
[00:20:08.880 --> 00:20:17.280]   this passage I think I have this passage okay yeah second Thessalonians 3 2 chapter 3 to 12. So
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.520]   if you have your bibles just turn there with me I want you to know that passage because
[00:20:21.520 --> 00:20:27.840]   Paul mentions this as a warning okay so I have the passage up here but I want you to go to that
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:36.080]   passage and know this passage well because it it was again as I mentioned in the beginning he was
[00:20:36.080 --> 00:20:42.560]   Paul was only in Thessalonica for a very short period of time and he was very aware that satanic
[00:20:42.560 --> 00:20:48.240]   attack was going to come and so as he was preaching the gospel he also warned them about the end times
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:53.600]   and the devil scheming and so this is what he says let no one deceive you in any way for that day
[00:20:53.600 --> 00:20:58.400]   will will not come unless the rebellion comes first and the man of lawlessness is revealed the
[00:20:58.400 --> 00:21:04.720]   son of destruction and referring to the anti-Christ who opposes and exalts himself against every so
[00:21:04.720 --> 00:21:09.600]   called god or object of worship in other words he's challenging everything that's being worshipped
[00:21:09.600 --> 00:21:14.240]   because he wants to be worshipped so that he takes his seat in the temple of god proclaiming himself
[00:21:14.240 --> 00:21:21.200]   to be god right so his deception is he's going to fool people to think that he is god so you see the
[00:21:21.200 --> 00:21:28.640]   work that he's doing Jesus is declared to be god right remember Thomas after he meets the resurrected
[00:21:28.640 --> 00:21:36.800]   Christ he's the first one who bows down and says my lord and my god so Thomas is known as known as
[00:21:36.800 --> 00:21:42.640]   the doubting Thomas but Thomas actually is the first one who recognizes his deity and says my
[00:21:42.640 --> 00:21:49.600]   lord and my god right so we see satanic work the first thing that is it tells us is he pretends to
[00:21:49.600 --> 00:21:55.200]   have a mortal wound and then he comes back and as a result of that he gets worshipped right do you
[00:21:55.200 --> 00:21:59.760]   not remember that when I was still with you I told you these things and you know what is restraining
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:05.360]   him now so that he may be revealed in his time for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work only
[00:22:05.360 --> 00:22:12.320]   he only he who now restrains it will do so until he is out of the way okay meaning god himself
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:20.400]   is restraining the main power so his spirit that opposes god and mimics god is has already been
[00:22:20.400 --> 00:22:25.920]   there from the beginning but the antichrist the the man of lawlessness has not been revealed in
[00:22:25.920 --> 00:22:31.760]   right for the mystery of lawlessness is already at work only he uh who now restrains it will do
[00:22:31.760 --> 00:22:36.800]   so until he is out of the way and then the lawless one will be revealed whom the lord jesus will kill
[00:22:36.800 --> 00:22:41.920]   with the breath of his mouth and bring to nothing by appearing of his coming the coming of the
[00:22:41.920 --> 00:22:48.320]   lawless one is by the activity of satan with all the power and false signs and wonders right so
[00:22:48.320 --> 00:22:53.440]   everything that christ has done he's going to mimic it and he's going to fool people by saying
[00:22:53.440 --> 00:22:58.560]   that he is christ that he is god and with all wicked deception for those who are perishing
[00:22:58.560 --> 00:23:04.000]   because they refuse to love the truth and so be saved so the ones who are being deceived are the
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:09.600]   ones who have not fully embraced the truth right so who is he deceiving who are the first ones
[00:23:09.600 --> 00:23:15.360]   that going to be that's going to be deceived probably nominal christians right because that's
[00:23:15.360 --> 00:23:20.240]   where it's going to begin because he's going to come as an angel of light so the people who are
[00:23:20.240 --> 00:23:25.040]   falsely following christ the nominal christians are the first ones because they refuse to love
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:29.840]   the truth therefore god sends them a strong delusion so that they may believe what is false
[00:23:29.840 --> 00:23:35.280]   so god allows this in order that all may be condemned who do not believe the truth but had
[00:23:35.280 --> 00:23:40.240]   pleasure in unrighteousness right so in other words all of this is god ordained so everything
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.800]   that is happening in chapter 13 is because god is allowing it to happen so the spirit of the
[00:23:44.800 --> 00:23:51.040]   antichrist has has been here from the beginning but the antichrist he's being restrained until
[00:23:51.040 --> 00:23:57.360]   that time comes right and his primary target first and foremost is going to be the church
[00:23:57.360 --> 00:24:01.920]   the nominal christians who are going through the motion who do not love the truth will be the first
[00:24:01.920 --> 00:24:09.840]   to be deceived okay let's go back so the beast by mimicking the death and resurrection of christ
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:17.040]   seems to be presenting himself in the place of christ so let me go back to
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:22.800]   isaiah 14 14 says i will ascend above the heights of the clouds i will make myself like the most
[00:24:22.800 --> 00:24:28.080]   high so remember when we are studying through isaiah right this is talking about the fall of
[00:24:28.080 --> 00:24:35.760]   satan and and how he desires to be in the place of god and and it seems like the antichrist is
[00:24:35.760 --> 00:24:41.280]   beginning to work to fool people so that he can receive the honor and glory that only the father
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:51.760]   deserves right that's how he has described his activity
[00:24:51.760 --> 00:25:01.360]   satan is worshipped as a result of the beast so the whole purpose of this beast is to gain attention
[00:25:01.360 --> 00:25:07.760]   and glory and ultimately as a result of that it says the dragon is going to get the glory right
[00:25:08.800 --> 00:25:09.920]   what does that sound like to you
[00:25:09.920 --> 00:25:20.640]   the work of antichrist is ultimately to to bring worship and honor to the dragon
[00:25:20.640 --> 00:25:22.800]   what does that sound like to you
[00:25:22.800 --> 00:25:28.560]   he is the antichrist
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:36.080]   sounds like christ right jesus says that i did not come in my own accord
[00:25:36.080 --> 00:25:42.720]   right to bring glory to himself but to the father right so the whole purpose of jesus was to come to
[00:25:42.720 --> 00:25:48.640]   magnify his father and the father says he magnifies the son and so if you look at this relationship
[00:25:48.640 --> 00:25:56.480]   between satan and antichrist satan gives him all authority right he has the same he has a 10 horns
[00:25:56.480 --> 00:26:04.720]   seven heads and a diadem just like satan but he is he is working to bring glory to the dragon
[00:26:04.720 --> 00:26:11.200]   right so you see the mimicking there so even the way he does it by by he says seemingly having a
[00:26:11.200 --> 00:26:15.600]   wounded head and then coming back to life and then all of a sudden people give him glory and then
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:22.960]   and then the satan himself gets the glory so as the beast mimics the dragon the dragon seems to be
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:28.080]   seems to try to mimic god meaning that he's doing the same thing the father did with his son
[00:26:28.880 --> 00:26:38.560]   but now he's doing with antichrist okay you following right if you are falling asleep on this
[00:26:38.560 --> 00:26:45.920]   i don't know what's going to keep you awake right it's so interesting that that this is this is how
[00:26:45.920 --> 00:26:52.960]   redemptive history is is happening that as god is working there is an undercurrent work constantly
[00:26:52.960 --> 00:27:00.080]   working against him right mimicking the same things that god is doing to oppose him right
[00:27:00.080 --> 00:27:07.440]   and that's why the devil's work is called scheming because it is not the red team and the blue team
[00:27:07.440 --> 00:27:14.480]   right it's god is working and the other side of that he's working against him
[00:27:14.480 --> 00:27:20.640]   so you can see how easily you can fall into the scheme because he's mimicking god
[00:27:20.960 --> 00:27:29.120]   right revolution 13-4 says they worship the beast saying who is like the beast and who can fight
[00:27:29.120 --> 00:27:37.680]   against it right even the language that is used to to worship satan in exodus 15 11 is
[00:27:37.680 --> 00:27:42.640]   says who is like you oh lord among the gods who is like you majestic and holy awesome and glorious
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:48.240]   he is doing wonders so even in the way that that the dragon is being worshipped the same language
[00:27:48.240 --> 00:27:53.600]   who or who is like the beast and who can fight against it right so everything that the beast
[00:27:53.600 --> 00:27:58.480]   is doing is mimicking god right but to bring glory to himself
[00:27:58.480 --> 00:28:08.160]   it was given a blasphemy words words against god his name and his dwelling along with all those
[00:28:08.160 --> 00:28:16.000]   in heaven for 42 months again remember that 42 months keeps reoccurring time times and a half a
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:24.240]   time right or three and a half years so this period that is being described with the anti-christ is
[00:28:24.240 --> 00:28:31.360]   being released for three and a half years it is intense but it is temporary meaning that just as
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:36.560]   he was released right and at the end of three and a half years when his work is done he's going to
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:44.240]   be bound so even in his rebellion even in everything that he is doing god is allowing it to happen
[00:28:44.240 --> 00:28:50.640]   for that period of time to serve his ultimate purpose for those who did not love the truth
[00:28:50.640 --> 00:28:56.320]   that he is allowing them to be deceived right remember we're studying that in the book of
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.760]   romans in chapter 11 that how god gave them a spirit of stupor right they had eyes and could
[00:29:01.760 --> 00:29:07.360]   not see but hearts and they could not feel ears and could not hear god is allowing that that
[00:29:07.360 --> 00:29:12.880]   allowing their hardening and rebellion to take its full course and so that's basically what god
[00:29:12.880 --> 00:29:19.680]   is doing he's allowing satan to do its work and the spirit of anti-christ has always been working
[00:29:19.680 --> 00:29:25.680]   but when the anti-christ is released he's allowing it to take the full course right so if you've been
[00:29:25.680 --> 00:29:30.240]   rebelling against god he's gonna he's gonna let you go as you've been chasing after the world
[00:29:30.240 --> 00:29:36.080]   he's gonna let you go right if you if you didn't love god he's just gonna let you go so during that
[00:29:36.080 --> 00:29:42.320]   period of intense period our identities are going to be clear right so you know i'm one of the
[00:29:42.320 --> 00:29:46.160]   struggles that we have in a post-christian culture is who is and who's not a christian
[00:29:46.160 --> 00:29:50.880]   and it's very difficult for us to say because you don't want to be judgmental right but yet if we
[00:29:50.880 --> 00:29:55.760]   don't identify who's in a christian then how do we disciple them do we share the gospel so jesus
[00:29:55.760 --> 00:30:01.280]   says right in the church only god's going to do that at the end time he's going to divide the
[00:30:01.280 --> 00:30:06.960]   wheat and the tares but during before then we're not going to be able to know we're not going because
[00:30:06.960 --> 00:30:13.520]   we're not god but during this period god is going to separate beating the wheat and the tares and
[00:30:13.520 --> 00:30:19.360]   he's going to allow the anti-christ to do his full work so if you have been going through the motion
[00:30:19.360 --> 00:30:24.640]   and your faith hasn't been wasn't real he said then when the persecution and the trials come
[00:30:24.640 --> 00:30:28.560]   it's going to be revealed and then and then he's going to describe what's going to happen to the
[00:30:28.560 --> 00:30:38.720]   true believers right and we'll talk about that so this beast was given permission to wage war
[00:30:38.720 --> 00:30:44.800]   against the saints and conquer them so you notice here all the non-christians what are they doing
[00:30:44.800 --> 00:30:56.560]   during this period up to this point what did what did we just say what what what is the world doing
[00:30:56.560 --> 00:31:04.560]   with the beast right now do they hate him do they recognize him they worship him right so all those
[00:31:04.560 --> 00:31:10.800]   who don't worship him the true saints of christ are going to be they're going to wage war against
[00:31:10.800 --> 00:31:16.800]   them okay so in other words during this period anyone who does not have the mark of the beast
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:22.480]   is going to go under heavy attack by anti-christ and his followers
[00:31:22.480 --> 00:31:29.840]   the saints being conquered is not referring to them losing salvation it's pretty clear that
[00:31:29.840 --> 00:31:34.320]   that's not what he's talking about this is a prophecy that the christians will physically be
[00:31:34.320 --> 00:31:44.240]   harmed but ultimately spiritually be saved right so imagine the language that all this time there's
[00:31:44.240 --> 00:31:50.240]   promises of god's restoration and protection but during this period he says the christians are
[00:31:50.240 --> 00:31:58.160]   going to be conquered right i mean think about how intense this is that the language in the bible
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:04.000]   says christians are going to be conquered by demonic power right so clearly it's not in
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:08.480]   reference to losing our salvation but that's how intense the physical persecution is going to be
[00:32:08.480 --> 00:32:15.120]   for the church i mean i think i have verses here so romans 8 38 to 39
[00:32:15.120 --> 00:32:20.640]   clearly it's not talking about some losing our salvation because it says for i am sure that
[00:32:20.640 --> 00:32:25.200]   neither death nor life nor angels nor rulers nor things present nor things to come nor powers
[00:32:25.200 --> 00:32:28.720]   nor height nor death nor anything else in all creation will be able to separate us from the
[00:32:28.720 --> 00:32:34.080]   love of god in christ jesus our lord so nothing not satan nothing is going to separate us from
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:39.040]   the love of christ but to be conquered by satan so clearly is not saying that it's going to be
[00:32:39.040 --> 00:32:47.360]   separated from god's love but if that's not the case it's talking about physically that's physical
[00:32:47.360 --> 00:32:52.960]   harm is going to come to christians during this period second corinthians 4 4 in their case the
[00:32:52.960 --> 00:32:57.200]   god of this world was blinded the mind of the unbelievers to keep them from seeing the light
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:33:03.760]   of the gospel the glory of christ who is the image of god so second corinthians 4 4 describes satan
[00:33:04.000 --> 00:33:09.920]   as the ruler of this age right so he was given authority over all creation
[00:33:09.920 --> 00:33:17.200]   and we're not just talking about the end times he's talking about the whole period that
[00:33:17.200 --> 00:33:22.560]   of human existence satan's the one who is in charge the work of antichrist has not been
[00:33:22.560 --> 00:33:28.080]   released yet right satan's influence has always been working and still working now
[00:33:29.040 --> 00:33:33.920]   but the intense period where the antichrist the man of lawlessness is going to be released
[00:33:33.920 --> 00:33:41.120]   and he's going to declare war against the saints is not yet because he's being restrained right
[00:33:41.120 --> 00:33:48.560]   until the last part of three and a half years and as a result the whole world will worship the beast
[00:33:48.560 --> 00:33:54.560]   right and again the passage that we looked at in philippians 2 8 through 11 right
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:34:01.600]   talk in description of christ and being found in human form he humbled himself became obedient to
[00:34:01.600 --> 00:34:06.240]   the point of death even death on a cross therefore god has highly exalted him bestowed on him the
[00:34:06.240 --> 00:34:10.800]   name that is above every name so that at the name of jesus every knee should bow in heaven and on
[00:34:10.800 --> 00:34:15.440]   earth and under the earth and every tongue confess that jesus christ is lord to the glory of of god
[00:34:15.440 --> 00:34:23.360]   the father so we see even the work of satan right and the beast said in the end right he
[00:34:24.560 --> 00:34:28.320]   pretends to be have have a mortal wound he comes back and he's
[00:34:28.320 --> 00:34:32.560]   healed the whole world comes and he is exalted and worshiped just like christ
[00:34:32.560 --> 00:34:37.040]   right and then the section finishes if you look at chapter 13
[00:34:37.040 --> 00:34:44.960]   and the middle section before we get to chapter 13 11 look with me in verse 10
[00:34:54.320 --> 00:34:58.080]   first ten it says if anyone is to be taken captive to captivity he goes
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:04.800]   if anyone is to be slain with the sword with the sword must he be slain here is a call for
[00:35:04.800 --> 00:35:10.000]   endurance and faith of the saints so what does it mean if anyone's to be taken captive to captivity
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.720]   he goes what does he mean by that
[00:35:14.800 --> 00:35:16.720]   so
[00:35:16.720 --> 00:35:28.560]   if anyone's to be slain with the sword with the sword must he be slain
[00:35:28.560 --> 00:35:39.280]   so captivity and martyrdom is ordained god is saying it's going to happen right he's not saying
[00:35:39.280 --> 00:35:44.000]   if you if you're captive you're not going to come out if you're going to be slain you're going to
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:52.560]   be slain right so he's basically saying when satan wages war and he targets christians during this
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:58.240]   period those the three and a half years or 42 weeks that is described is going to be intense
[00:35:58.240 --> 00:36:02.880]   and that's why he ends with here is a call for the endurance and the faith of the saints
[00:36:02.880 --> 00:36:08.400]   right in other words hold on to your faith to the end that's exactly what it says in matthew 24
[00:36:08.400 --> 00:36:15.040]   he who endures to the end shall be saved right this is part of the reason why i told you kind
[00:36:15.040 --> 00:36:21.840]   of like post you know post rapture view um i kind of lean toward that i'm not i'm not strong on it
[00:36:21.840 --> 00:36:26.720]   but i kind of lean toward that because the language that i see in the scripture describes
[00:36:26.720 --> 00:36:35.040]   a church going through intense period right if you're a pre-trib view preacher viewers will say
[00:36:35.040 --> 00:36:39.120]   that the most of the church is raptured and only the christians who became a christian during the
[00:36:39.120 --> 00:36:42.800]   first three and a half years of the tribulation they're the ones who are being targeted that's
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:49.200]   how they'll describe this but again it to me it seems like the church itself is going to be going
[00:36:49.200 --> 00:36:54.720]   through this tribulation right so during that period every christian's faith is going to be
[00:36:54.720 --> 00:36:59.120]   tested with severity if that when when and if that happens
[00:36:59.120 --> 00:37:12.560]   so you notice you know like the first beast and how it's kind of mimicking christ and how satan
[00:37:12.560 --> 00:37:18.800]   is mimicking god and it's the whole purpose is to bring glory to themselves right he that's why
[00:37:18.800 --> 00:37:24.800]   he's called the anti-christ he's going against christ the second beast it's even more clear
[00:37:26.800 --> 00:37:33.600]   its identity may be in reference to false prophets who assist in the work of the first beast the
[00:37:33.600 --> 00:37:39.120]   anti-christ so if you remember the first piece is coming out of the sea which is away from them
[00:37:39.120 --> 00:37:46.000]   from a distant place but the second beast rises from the earth from where they are right so in
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:53.440]   other words the false prophets are going to be or whether it's one or many they're going to be in
[00:37:53.440 --> 00:38:03.280]   their midst in fact the way that the second beast is described it has two horns like a lamb and spoke
[00:38:03.280 --> 00:38:11.200]   like a dragon right so it says his appearance was like a lamb but what comes out of his mouth
[00:38:11.200 --> 00:38:16.560]   is just like a dragon like is demonic this seems to be an accurate description of false prophets
[00:38:18.960 --> 00:38:24.560]   where on the surface they come as an angel of light but the actual content of their words is
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:32.640]   venomous is satanic this is a description of false prophets okay i'm gonna go to the passages okay
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:38.560]   so second corinthians 11 14 to 15 it says and no wonder for even satan disguises himself as an
[00:38:38.560 --> 00:38:42.800]   angel of light so it is no surprise if his servants also disguise themselves as servants
[00:38:42.800 --> 00:38:54.320]   of righteousness their end will correspond with their deeds okay let me come back to that okay
[00:38:54.320 --> 00:39:02.640]   the scripture tells us to test and prove the prophets from god because from the very beginning
[00:39:02.640 --> 00:39:08.640]   from the old testament from the time of christ and all this period and especially at the end times
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:15.600]   he says that the false prophets are going to come so satan sends and the antichrist antichrist
[00:39:15.600 --> 00:39:22.800]   mimics the work of jesus and brings glory to the dragon and then if you notice that the false
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:33.200]   prophets are going to function like the holy spirit okay and let me explain okay i'm going
[00:39:33.200 --> 00:39:44.080]   to come back to these passages okay he exercises the same authority as the beast right so the
[00:39:44.080 --> 00:39:51.200]   beast exercise the same authority as as the dragon satan and then the second beast exercise the same
[00:39:51.200 --> 00:40:02.480]   authority as the first beast the antichrist he seems like a beast but his work is demonic
[00:40:02.480 --> 00:40:14.560]   he makes the world worship the first beast mimicking the holy spirit in the trinity
[00:40:17.360 --> 00:40:24.160]   remember jesus says it is better for him to go because until he goes the holy spirit cannot come
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.080]   and he says when the holy spirit comes what did he say he's going to bring to remembrance
[00:40:28.080 --> 00:40:34.080]   everything that i have taught you so the whole goal of the holy spirit is to point back to christ
[00:40:34.080 --> 00:40:39.040]   and everything that he has done and he said the second beast is going to come to do the same
[00:40:39.040 --> 00:40:47.840]   to bring worship to the beast he says he makes fire come down from heaven verse 13
[00:40:47.840 --> 00:40:56.000]   so 13 13 it performs great signs even making fire come down from heaven to earth in front of people
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:01.280]   where does that happen what scene does that remind you of
[00:41:01.280 --> 00:41:08.480]   the pentecost when the holy spirit comes they speak tongues of fire
[00:41:08.480 --> 00:41:13.520]   right they speak tongues of fire so they notice fire so fire and the holy spirit oftentimes go
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:18.000]   hand in hand so he says that the second beast is going to come and he's going to perform these
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:22.080]   these miraculous signs and again it mimics the work of the holy spirit
[00:41:22.080 --> 00:41:25.220]   okay
[00:41:25.220 --> 00:41:33.280]   his ultimate goal is to deceive the world to worship the beast
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:38.320]   in contrast the goal of the holy spirit is to convict the world of truth
[00:41:38.320 --> 00:41:45.440]   right so the whole goal of the of the false prophets is to deceive and to bring glory to
[00:41:45.440 --> 00:41:51.040]   the beast the whole work of the holy spirit is to bring to remembrance the truth the conviction
[00:41:51.040 --> 00:42:00.960]   of truth to repentance to bring them to christ in verse 15 it says it gives breath to the image
[00:42:00.960 --> 00:42:08.000]   of the beast verse 15 and it was allowed to give breath to the image of the beast so that the image
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:12.400]   of the beast might even speak and might cause those who would not worship the image of the beast
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:22.560]   to be slain holy spirit is oftentimes described as the as breath itself in hebrew the word for
[00:42:22.560 --> 00:42:29.920]   spirit is rock which means air in motion or also breath and sometimes understood as life right
[00:42:30.720 --> 00:42:37.280]   so the holy spirit itself is described as giving breath or or life itself
[00:42:37.280 --> 00:42:45.200]   and the holy spirit is he who gives life to the image of god so this false prophet is performing
[00:42:45.200 --> 00:42:52.000]   signs and is giving life fake life to the image of the beast right and he says exactly the opposite
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:58.320]   what the holy spirit does the holy spirit is deposited in us right and and to restore the
[00:42:58.320 --> 00:43:06.240]   image of the creator in us do you see how each one of what they're doing is mimicking the trinity
[00:43:06.240 --> 00:43:10.960]   it says it gives the mark of the beast on all the people
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:16.240]   and number six six six why is the number of this b666
[00:43:16.240 --> 00:43:27.520]   god's number is 777 everything he does is mimicking right everything that satan does
[00:43:27.520 --> 00:43:32.080]   is mimicking he's not quite there he satan was the highest of the angels
[00:43:32.080 --> 00:43:39.520]   and he's using his power to get as close to god as possible so god is 777 the number of completion
[00:43:39.520 --> 00:43:45.120]   the number of man is six right and so even in his number he's trying to mimic god
[00:43:45.120 --> 00:43:50.880]   the holy spirit is a mark of a genuine believer
[00:43:53.680 --> 00:43:58.080]   so there there is no christian who say who can say that they're christian if they don't have
[00:43:58.080 --> 00:44:03.280]   the mark of the holy spirit evidence of the holy spirit in them so you see how everything
[00:44:03.280 --> 00:44:08.720]   that the dragon the first beast and the second beast everything that they're doing is mimicking
[00:44:08.720 --> 00:44:14.640]   god the father the son and the holy spirit and so that's why he's called the antichrist and
[00:44:14.640 --> 00:44:21.600]   everything he does is to oppose the father and to by deception false teaching false miracles
[00:44:21.600 --> 00:44:26.080]   by mimicking what god is doing he's trying to get people to come to him instead of the father
[00:44:26.080 --> 00:44:30.000]   and god is going to allow that for a period remember he said that the deception
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:37.840]   is going to be so great that even the elect if that was possible would be deceived that's how
[00:44:37.840 --> 00:44:42.640]   powerful the deception is going to be that it's going to be very hard to distinguish between
[00:44:42.640 --> 00:44:48.480]   somebody who's coming from god and somebody who's coming from satan right that that's how god
[00:44:48.480 --> 00:44:54.320]   describes it during that period that's how strong the deception is going to be and again why over
[00:44:54.320 --> 00:45:01.600]   and over and over and again the bible tells us to stay alert and stay sober right because it's not
[00:45:01.600 --> 00:45:07.440]   obvious satanic work is not obvious go back to some of the passages
[00:45:16.960 --> 00:45:22.480]   so from the even from the old testament god gives clear guidelines as to how to tell because false
[00:45:22.480 --> 00:45:27.280]   prophets existed from the very beginning right so this work of antichrist and satan
[00:45:27.280 --> 00:45:34.480]   where he releases antichrist for a period the man of lawlessness there's a specific time where god's
[00:45:34.480 --> 00:45:40.400]   going to allow that at the end but his general work of antichrist to mimic god and to bring
[00:45:40.400 --> 00:45:47.200]   confusion and division and to scheme to thwart god's work has always been working so from the
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.320]   very beginning false prophets have coming so if if one prophet comes and says god wants you to do
[00:45:52.320 --> 00:45:56.960]   this there's always the anti-prophet that would come and say no god did not tell you to do this
[00:45:56.960 --> 00:46:02.320]   so there every time god moved there was an anti-movement because that's exactly how satan
[00:46:02.320 --> 00:46:08.720]   is described beginning from the garden of eden god said do not eat and he says surely did god
[00:46:08.720 --> 00:46:14.960]   really tell you this right so from the very beginning he was challenging god if you look at the
[00:46:14.960 --> 00:46:23.040]   jesus at when he was um he's in the desert he's like did god if you're really god well the bible
[00:46:23.040 --> 00:46:27.520]   said this if you jump off that he's going to come and protect you so every movement of god there's
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:33.200]   an anti-movement so from the beginning deuteronomy 13 1 to 5 it says if a prophet or a dreamer
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:38.320]   of dreams arises among you and gives you a sign or a wonder so a dreamer is in reference to somebody
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:45.040]   who is fortune telling okay he's talking about divination so somebody who is practicing divination
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:50.960]   and saying that they are prophesying and gives you a sign right and he's performing these sign
[00:46:50.960 --> 00:46:55.840]   and wonders that tells you to come to pass and if he says let us go after other gods which you have
[00:46:55.840 --> 00:47:00.800]   not known and let us serve them so in other words even if he is performing many miracles if he's not
[00:47:00.800 --> 00:47:06.000]   bringing you to the true god he's not from god right even though he's performing many of these
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:09.840]   miracles you shall not listen to the words of the prophets or that dreamer of dreams for the lord
[00:47:09.840 --> 00:47:13.760]   your god is testing you to know whether you love the lord your god with all your heart and with
[00:47:13.760 --> 00:47:19.120]   all your soul in other words god says he's going to allow the deception to happen just like he
[00:47:19.120 --> 00:47:24.080]   allowed israel's hearts to be hardened because they kept on hardening their heart hardening
[00:47:24.080 --> 00:47:30.240]   their heart so he says he releases them so he's testing the nation of israel and he's allowing
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:34.560]   these false prophets to be among them you shall walk after the lord your god and fear him and
[00:47:34.560 --> 00:47:39.520]   keep his commandments and obey his voice and you shall serve him and hold fast in but that prophet
[00:47:39.520 --> 00:47:43.120]   or that dreamer of dreams shall be put to death because he has taught rebellion against the lord
[00:47:43.120 --> 00:47:47.280]   your god who brought you out of the land of egypt and redeemed you out of the house of slavery to
[00:47:47.280 --> 00:47:51.840]   make you leave the way in which the lord your god commanded you to walk so you shall purge the evil
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:58.160]   from your midst so again this is from the very very beginning of israel's history as his laws
[00:47:58.160 --> 00:48:05.280]   were going out false prophets were coming and contradicting the true prophets jeremiah 23 as
[00:48:05.280 --> 00:48:11.840]   israel is being taken into captivity that false false activity was was very rampant during that
[00:48:11.840 --> 00:48:16.000]   period thus says the lord of hosts do not listen to the words of the prophets who prophesied to
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:20.640]   you filling you with vain hopes they speak visions of their own minds not from the mouth of the lord
[00:48:20.640 --> 00:48:24.640]   they say continually to those who despise the word of the lord it shall be well with you and
[00:48:24.640 --> 00:48:30.320]   to everyone who stubbornly follows his own heart they say no disaster shall come upon you for who
[00:48:30.320 --> 00:48:35.200]   among them has stood in the council of the lord to see and to hear his word or who has paid attention
[00:48:35.200 --> 00:48:41.760]   to his word and listen behold the storm of the lord wrath has gone forth a world whirling tempest
[00:48:41.760 --> 00:48:45.840]   it will burst upon the head of the wicked the anger of the lord will not turn back until he
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:50.720]   has executed and accomplished his intents of his heart in the latter days you understand it clearly
[00:48:51.280 --> 00:48:55.680]   i did not send the prophets yet they ran i did not speak to them yet they prophesied
[00:48:55.680 --> 00:48:59.680]   but if they had stood in my council then they would have proclaimed my words to my people
[00:48:59.680 --> 00:49:05.760]   and they would have turned them from their evil way and from the evil of their deeds so again
[00:49:05.760 --> 00:49:10.240]   these prophets are coming warning the nation of israel to repent because judgment is coming and
[00:49:10.240 --> 00:49:15.200]   then the anti-prophets right the spirit of antichrist was coming and said no god is not
[00:49:15.200 --> 00:49:21.840]   angry with you and they were constantly trying to comfort them instead of bringing them to repentance
[00:49:21.840 --> 00:49:29.920]   so you see the work of antichrist mimicking god constantly opposing his servants right and so
[00:49:29.920 --> 00:49:36.240]   this is the spirit of the antichrist it has always existed matthew 7 15 beware of the false prophets
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:41.760]   who come to you in sheep's clothing but inwardly are ravenous wolves and that's the danger of the
[00:49:41.760 --> 00:49:47.840]   spirit of antichrist because he does not come he doesn't have a separate garb that says antichrist
[00:49:47.840 --> 00:49:56.000]   antichrist always comes in sheep's clothing right where you'd surprise like really he would say that
[00:49:56.000 --> 00:50:02.720]   right that's why when false prophets are are finally revealed many people would have a hard
[00:50:02.720 --> 00:50:07.600]   time believing they're false prophets because they look like true prophets and that's how the bible
[00:50:07.600 --> 00:50:13.440]   describes them second peter 2 1 but false prophets also among rose among the people just as there
[00:50:13.440 --> 00:50:18.000]   will be false teachers among you who will secretly bring in destructive heresies even denying the
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:25.360]   master who brought them who bought them bringing upon themselves with destruction right remember
[00:50:25.360 --> 00:50:32.480]   the early church had people who physically saw jesus's resurrection
[00:50:34.320 --> 00:50:40.800]   they had disciples who walked with him and false prophets were so prevalent
[00:50:40.800 --> 00:50:45.280]   they say no jesus did not resurrect from that there's people who actually
[00:50:45.280 --> 00:50:48.960]   saw his resurrection and false prophets were going and they were so convincing
[00:50:48.960 --> 00:50:54.080]   that by the second and third generation there was a whole group of churches already fallen out
[00:50:54.080 --> 00:51:01.520]   right from the get-go first john 4 1 beloved do not believe every spirit but test the spirit
[00:51:01.520 --> 00:51:07.840]   to see whether they are from god for many false prophets had gone out into the world right again
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:16.240]   for every movement of god there's an anti-movement right and the thing that should really keep us
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:26.240]   sober again when you confess christ as lord and savior we've crossed that line that we don't live
[00:51:26.240 --> 00:51:30.640]   with this world's worldview we don't believe that this world is it that there is a spiritual
[00:51:30.640 --> 00:51:37.600]   battle going on right ephesians chapter 6 tells us that we're not fighting against flesh and blood
[00:51:37.600 --> 00:51:43.280]   that there are spiritual dark forces that are always at work now the the portion of what we
[00:51:43.280 --> 00:51:48.240]   started is talking about intense period where everything that is already going on is going to
[00:51:48.240 --> 00:51:54.800]   be intensified at the at the end times right but it is already here right paul says in second
[00:51:54.800 --> 00:52:03.360]   thessalonians he says is the stat spirit is already here so if you look at if you look at the
[00:52:03.360 --> 00:52:11.920]   seven churches that the book of revelation begins with now there's two churches where there isn't
[00:52:11.920 --> 00:52:17.280]   clear rebuke and then they obviously there's some churches who are experiencing intense persecution
[00:52:17.280 --> 00:52:23.680]   but for the most part the problem with the churches were one was they've forgotten their
[00:52:23.680 --> 00:52:28.480]   first love there's another one where there's sharp rebuke where they have the reputation of being
[00:52:28.480 --> 00:52:34.320]   alive but they're dead and then the most severest rebuke is going to the laodicean church where they
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:40.480]   were lukewarm they were neither hot nor cold they're only second third generation removed
[00:52:40.480 --> 00:52:45.840]   from the resurrection of christ and they're already lukewarm they're already forsaking
[00:52:45.840 --> 00:52:52.560]   their first love they already have a reputation but it's not real right so if there is a spiritual
[00:52:52.560 --> 00:53:01.120]   battle going on which we believe to be in the state of lukewarmness right and not to be passionately
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:06.640]   following christ is no different than a soldier who walks into the battlefield doesn't know that
[00:53:06.640 --> 00:53:14.320]   people are shooting at him so how dangerous is it to be not be focused as a christian right
[00:53:14.320 --> 00:53:21.200]   a lukewarm christian is somebody who has forgotten who he is a lukewarm christian is somebody who has
[00:53:21.200 --> 00:53:27.920]   forgotten that this is not our home and we we are trying so hard to make this place our home
[00:53:27.920 --> 00:53:32.800]   when this is not our home so demonic work has caused us to fall asleep
[00:53:32.800 --> 00:53:38.400]   why the book of revelation is so important for our christian walk
[00:53:38.400 --> 00:53:42.880]   because our primary battle here is lukewarmness
[00:53:45.840 --> 00:53:51.440]   is it not isn't that the struggle that's a struggle of my heart constantly and have to
[00:53:51.440 --> 00:53:58.160]   constantly remind myself to stay sober because i'm not from here right i'm a soldier and are just
[00:53:58.160 --> 00:54:04.160]   passing by my home is not here so the moment i forget that the temptation just creeps in i don't
[00:54:04.160 --> 00:54:12.560]   have to go after it just creeps in so we have to fight to stay sober that these things are realities
[00:54:12.560 --> 00:54:17.280]   that causes us to pray that causes us to passionately seek god to tell other people this
[00:54:17.280 --> 00:54:24.640]   sense of urgency so when we read this in faith it should cause us to have a sense of urgency in our
[00:54:24.640 --> 00:54:34.240]   life right and i think you'll all agree right but if if if there is satanic work not just in the
[00:54:34.240 --> 00:54:41.600]   church not just in the bigger realm but in your life to distract you right mimicking the things
[00:54:41.600 --> 00:54:49.040]   of christ to distract you from true worship of god and worshiping idols right how prevalent is
[00:54:49.040 --> 00:54:53.760]   that in our life and i asked you that last week to take some time to discuss that and i can honestly
[00:54:53.760 --> 00:55:00.320]   confess i see it all the time and it is not coming in a form of horror movies and and you know the
[00:55:00.320 --> 00:55:05.760]   reason why i mentioned that last week is because it desensitizes us to demonic things and we
[00:55:05.760 --> 00:55:11.840]   shouldn't be desensitized to that because it's real right it should keep us sober there should
[00:55:11.840 --> 00:55:24.080]   cause us a sense of urgency so the discussion question for today number one what is the
[00:55:24.080 --> 00:55:28.160]   primary work of the two beasts and what is their method to accomplish their purpose this is
[00:55:28.160 --> 00:55:32.880]   basically review of what we went through today number two what are we are exhorted by paul in
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:37.680]   ephesians 6 10 through 20 to put on the full armor of god because of the spiritual battle we are in
[00:55:37.680 --> 00:55:42.080]   what way does each of these armors help us in our spiritual battle against the schemes of the devil
[00:55:42.080 --> 00:55:46.800]   so talk about each one instead of talking about the generally you know the helmet of salvation
[00:55:46.800 --> 00:55:53.360]   breastplate of righteousness all of these things like specifically how does that affect our battle
[00:55:53.360 --> 00:55:57.280]   our spiritual battle okay and then third in what way does our generation think too much of the
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:56:03.760]   devil or too little of him what is the danger in either extreme okay so take some time to discuss
[00:56:03.760 --> 00:56:06.400]   that in your group and then uh let me pray for us and then we'll finish
[00:56:06.400 --> 00:56:15.120]   heavenly father we want to thank you for your word we thank you for the fellowship of christians
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:20.000]   and we pray father that during our time of discussion that you would speak to us
[00:56:21.200 --> 00:56:27.520]   help us lord god to remain sober to not to love the world that all that is in the world lord god
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:35.520]   is not from you help us lord to live true to our confession help us lord god that the word that
[00:56:35.520 --> 00:56:41.840]   you've implanted in us would bear fruit help us to see it the world through your eyes that we would
[00:56:41.840 --> 00:56:48.240]   not fall in despair that we would not allow grumbling to dominate our hearts help us lord
[00:56:48.240 --> 00:56:53.760]   god to be affected by your work and your love that all that we do may be a reasonable response
[00:56:53.760 --> 00:56:58.240]   so i pray for your blessing over the time of small group in jesus name we pray amen
