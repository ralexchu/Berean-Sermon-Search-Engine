[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:19.200]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 3 verse 27 through 31.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:24.160]   Romans chapter 3 verse 27 to 31.
[00:00:24.160 --> 00:00:26.720]   Then what becomes of our boasting?
[00:00:26.720 --> 00:00:27.980]   It is excluded.
[00:00:27.980 --> 00:00:29.740]   By what kind of law?
[00:00:29.740 --> 00:00:30.740]   By a law of works?
[00:00:30.740 --> 00:00:33.460]   No, but by the law of faith.
[00:00:33.460 --> 00:00:37.580]   For we hold that one is justified by faith apart from works of the law.
[00:00:37.580 --> 00:00:39.120]   Or is God the God of Jews only?
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:41.360]   Is he not the God of Gentiles also?
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:47.080]   Yes, of Gentiles also, since God is one who will justify the circumcised by faith and
[00:00:47.080 --> 00:00:49.660]   the uncircumcised through faith.
[00:00:49.660 --> 00:00:51.880]   Do we then overthrow the law by this faith?
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:52.880]   By no means.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:55.360]   On the contrary, we uphold the law.
[00:00:55.360 --> 00:01:01.720]   Let's pray.
[00:01:01.720 --> 00:01:06.720]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your blessing over this time.
[00:01:06.720 --> 00:01:12.880]   We pray that you would cause our hearts to be moldable.
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:21.320]   You give us ears to hear and a burning desire, Lord God, to be doers and not just hearers.
[00:01:21.320 --> 00:01:25.800]   We pray that your word would have its authority and its power.
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:31.740]   That all the fluff, Lord God, that sometimes surrounds what we do, that you would help
[00:01:31.740 --> 00:01:35.880]   us, Lord God, to get to the core of who you are and your message.
[00:01:35.880 --> 00:01:39.920]   That your living word will be at center stage.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:43.920]   That your people will hear the voice of your son Jesus and follow him.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:46.200]   We thank you, Jesus, and we pray.
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:47.200]   Amen.
[00:01:47.200 --> 00:01:51.360]   Again, as you guys know, we're continuing the study in Romans.
[00:01:51.360 --> 00:01:55.080]   And, you know, after we get through three chapters, and we're going to be, you know,
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.400]   many more chapters to come on the subject of faith, justification by faith alone.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:04.000]   And if you pay attention very superficially, and I can almost guarantee you, it's kind
[00:02:04.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   of like Isaiah.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.320]   If you follow along superficially, after a while, you're going to like, "Enough judgment."
[00:02:09.320 --> 00:02:14.080]   You know, judgment for this city, judgment for this nation, judgment for this sin, and
[00:02:14.080 --> 00:02:15.080]   that sin.
[00:02:15.080 --> 00:02:17.200]   And you're just going to like, "Judgment, judgment, judgment, judgment."
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:19.720]   Sixty-six chapters of this.
[00:02:19.720 --> 00:02:24.560]   But you have to pay very close attention, because there's a reason why it's there, right?
[00:02:24.560 --> 00:02:31.080]   If, especially the book of Romans, it gets into the nitty-gritty of how faith works and
[00:02:31.080 --> 00:02:34.440]   what justification really is.
[00:02:34.440 --> 00:02:40.320]   Because a superficial understanding of our faith leads to a very superficial application
[00:02:40.320 --> 00:02:42.000]   of our faith.
[00:02:42.000 --> 00:02:47.360]   And so our life is directly a reflection of what we understand and how we are convicted
[00:02:47.360 --> 00:02:50.400]   by the things that we profess.
[00:02:50.400 --> 00:02:53.800]   We can profess it without meaning anything, right?
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:57.320]   You can say you're a fan of Lakers, right?
[00:02:57.320 --> 00:02:58.320]   Anybody can say that.
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:02:59.320]   You can say it.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:01.360]   But you can see it by the life.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:05.200]   You can see what they really believe and who they really are.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:11.600]   You know, the Gospel message itself in 1 Corinthians 118 says, "For the word of the cross is folly,
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:15.760]   it's foolishness to those who are perishing, but to those who are being saved it is the
[00:03:15.760 --> 00:03:17.760]   power of God."
[00:03:17.760 --> 00:03:22.040]   Now, some of you who've been raised in the church and you've heard the Gospel since you
[00:03:22.040 --> 00:03:28.040]   were in your mother's womb, and you'll say that you didn't become a believer maybe until
[00:03:28.040 --> 00:03:31.200]   high school or college or later on in life.
[00:03:31.200 --> 00:03:35.240]   But you don't ever remember the Gospel being foolish.
[00:03:35.240 --> 00:03:37.840]   Because you never had to really think about it.
[00:03:37.840 --> 00:03:41.920]   I mean, you've been told since you were a little kid that Jesus Christ died for your
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:46.400]   sins and He loves you and that your sins are atoned for.
[00:03:46.400 --> 00:03:48.520]   So just like, "Oh, that sounds about right.
[00:03:48.520 --> 00:03:51.760]   We have a God who loves us unconditionally, the Son of God."
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.760]   So you never really seriously considered the foolishness of the message of the cross.
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:04:01.160]   See, there's also a negative part of that.
[00:04:01.160 --> 00:04:03.960]   I mean, good thing that you grew up in the church and you were around the Gospel, but
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:10.000]   the negative part of that is that sometimes we don't take to serious consideration why
[00:04:10.000 --> 00:04:12.880]   it would be foolish to the world.
[00:04:12.880 --> 00:04:15.880]   Some of you may have become a Christian later on in life and you may have remembered at
[00:04:15.880 --> 00:04:19.400]   one point in your life that somebody tried to share the Gospel with you and how just
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:22.040]   foolish that message was.
[00:04:22.040 --> 00:04:31.560]   That the Son of God stepped off of His throne and offered His Son, offered Himself as a
[00:04:31.560 --> 00:04:35.160]   living sacrifice for us.
[00:04:35.160 --> 00:04:38.320]   If you grew up hearing that, it may not sound weird, but if you hear that for the first
[00:04:38.320 --> 00:04:41.480]   time, that's strange.
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:45.160]   Why would, if I told you that I have $100 in my pocket, I'm just going to give it out
[00:04:45.160 --> 00:04:46.160]   to you.
[00:04:46.160 --> 00:04:48.400]   You'd just come up, right?
[00:04:48.400 --> 00:04:51.120]   How many of you would believe me?
[00:04:51.120 --> 00:04:52.120]   Some of you.
[00:04:52.120 --> 00:04:53.120]   Very naive, right?
[00:04:53.120 --> 00:04:54.120]   Maybe he might.
[00:04:54.120 --> 00:04:55.120]   I don't want to lose him.
[00:04:55.120 --> 00:04:58.800]   A lot of you, it's like, "Come on.
[00:04:58.800 --> 00:04:59.800]   Look at his clothes.
[00:04:59.800 --> 00:05:00.800]   He can't afford that."
[00:05:00.800 --> 00:05:01.800]   I'm kidding.
[00:05:01.800 --> 00:05:04.760]   Some of you, most of you are going to, you know, from deduction say, "That's not going
[00:05:04.760 --> 00:05:05.760]   to happen.
[00:05:05.760 --> 00:05:06.760]   You're not going to believe me."
[00:05:06.760 --> 00:05:07.760]   Right?
[00:05:07.760 --> 00:05:11.320]   But we're talking about God.
[00:05:11.320 --> 00:05:17.440]   We're talking about Son of God compared to just even His creation, not even Him, just
[00:05:17.440 --> 00:05:18.440]   His creation.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:23.720]   What He was able to do simply by His Word.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:29.800]   That that God saw a little speck, a bacteria, a small little bacteria, and for whatever
[00:05:29.800 --> 00:05:34.600]   the reason, thought that we were precious enough that He would pursue us and give His
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:39.240]   only begotten Son to save us, and we never questioned that.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:41.680]   It's like, "Oh, okay.
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:05:44.880]   I'll take that."
[00:05:44.880 --> 00:05:50.800]   And because sometimes we haven't thought seriously about what it is that we confess.
[00:05:50.800 --> 00:05:55.620]   One, we have a hard time understanding why the non-Christians are so, you know, rejecting
[00:05:55.620 --> 00:05:57.560]   of the Gospel.
[00:05:57.560 --> 00:06:04.320]   And two, because we don't fully understand, we don't dig and examine what it is that we
[00:06:04.320 --> 00:06:06.600]   profess to believe.
[00:06:06.600 --> 00:06:07.600]   We just assume it.
[00:06:07.600 --> 00:06:08.600]   Of course I believe it.
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:10.880]   We just assume it.
[00:06:10.880 --> 00:06:16.440]   That it doesn't drive us deeper into a deeper walk with God, deeper appreciation, deeper
[00:06:16.440 --> 00:06:17.440]   sanctification.
[00:06:17.440 --> 00:06:21.760]   You know, we've been talking about justification by faith, right?
[00:06:21.760 --> 00:06:22.760]   It's by faith alone.
[00:06:22.760 --> 00:06:27.000]   And the simple message of the cross is, you cannot earn your salvation.
[00:06:27.000 --> 00:06:28.000]   There's nothing you can add.
[00:06:28.000 --> 00:06:30.920]   The Scripture says that we were dead in our trespasses.
[00:06:30.920 --> 00:06:32.000]   We're dead.
[00:06:32.000 --> 00:06:34.880]   Not weak, not astray.
[00:06:34.880 --> 00:06:37.160]   We're dead in our trespasses.
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:40.640]   So God did not send a rope down saying, "Hey, you need to climb this up.
[00:06:40.640 --> 00:06:41.640]   How do you do that?
[00:06:41.640 --> 00:06:43.360]   How do you save a dead person from doing that?"
[00:06:43.360 --> 00:06:44.360]   You can't.
[00:06:44.360 --> 00:06:49.240]   We were absolutely, utterly helpless that Christ came, and even the faith that we had,
[00:06:49.240 --> 00:06:52.760]   He had to revive us.
[00:06:52.760 --> 00:06:58.120]   You know, whenever we talk about salvation by faith alone, if we're not careful, we have
[00:06:58.120 --> 00:07:04.480]   two ways that we end up ultimately rejecting this truth.
[00:07:04.480 --> 00:07:09.280]   The first, we call this cheap grace.
[00:07:09.280 --> 00:07:12.680]   Where it's just passed out, and it's like, "Oh, anybody want it?
[00:07:12.680 --> 00:07:13.680]   So I'll take it.
[00:07:13.680 --> 00:07:14.680]   Well, why not?
[00:07:14.680 --> 00:07:15.680]   What have you got to lose?"
[00:07:15.680 --> 00:07:16.680]   Right?
[00:07:16.680 --> 00:07:19.940]   We don't live in places where we're risking our lives.
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.240]   You know, we want to go to churches where nice air conditioning, good Sunday school
[00:07:23.240 --> 00:07:25.280]   program, and so it's just a matter of choice.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:27.740]   Do I want to be here or there?
[00:07:27.740 --> 00:07:29.280]   So there's not much sacrifice.
[00:07:29.280 --> 00:07:34.560]   So when gospel was preached as a free grace, as a gift, why not?
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:37.360]   I'll take it.
[00:07:37.360 --> 00:07:44.920]   What do you call somebody who takes advantage of the grace of generous people?
[00:07:44.920 --> 00:07:51.020]   Don't think about the complicated SAT words, just the immediate knee-jerk reaction.
[00:07:51.020 --> 00:07:59.980]   What do you call somebody who takes advantage over and over again of somebody who's gracious?
[00:07:59.980 --> 00:08:00.980]   Maybe a freeloader?
[00:08:00.980 --> 00:08:05.980]   Somebody who has more stronger emotions, jerk, or you know, like, we call them a freeloader
[00:08:05.980 --> 00:08:08.620]   because he just, "Oh, that person's gracious.
[00:08:08.620 --> 00:08:09.620]   I'll take it."
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   Right?
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:11.620]   "If it's free, it's for me.
[00:08:11.620 --> 00:08:12.620]   Give me three."
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:13.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:08:13.620 --> 00:08:15.140]   "I want it."
[00:08:15.140 --> 00:08:17.380]   And so we've taken the grace of God.
[00:08:17.380 --> 00:08:22.140]   Okay, and again, a dangerous way to receive the grace of God is just cheap.
[00:08:22.140 --> 00:08:23.140]   "I'll take it."
[00:08:23.140 --> 00:08:24.140]   Right?
[00:08:24.140 --> 00:08:25.140]   "Well, it's free.
[00:08:25.140 --> 00:08:26.980]   It's nothing we do."
[00:08:26.980 --> 00:08:27.980]   Right?
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:28.980]   "It's not about what we do.
[00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:29.980]   It's what He did."
[00:08:29.980 --> 00:08:31.540]   And you have these cliches we throw around.
[00:08:31.540 --> 00:08:32.540]   Christians are not perfect.
[00:08:32.540 --> 00:08:34.020]   We're just forgiven.
[00:08:34.020 --> 00:08:38.080]   And so we throw these cliches around to justify all kinds of sin in our life.
[00:08:38.080 --> 00:08:41.840]   But it's okay because salvation is by grace.
[00:08:41.840 --> 00:08:42.840]   It's only by faith.
[00:08:42.840 --> 00:08:44.620]   It's not by works.
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:47.060]   So we have that end.
[00:08:47.060 --> 00:08:51.540]   And then we have the other end where, you know, we've been taught since we were young,
[00:08:51.540 --> 00:08:54.340]   you know, that you have to earn everything.
[00:08:54.340 --> 00:08:55.780]   You want to get a good grade, you have to earn it.
[00:08:55.780 --> 00:08:56.780]   They're not going to give it to you.
[00:08:56.780 --> 00:08:58.700]   Money doesn't grow on trees.
[00:08:58.700 --> 00:08:59.960]   You have to earn that.
[00:08:59.960 --> 00:09:07.220]   If you're a respectable, honorable person, you don't go and get free stuff.
[00:09:07.220 --> 00:09:08.580]   You're supposed to earn it.
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:10.700]   This is what we teach our children.
[00:09:10.700 --> 00:09:14.900]   This is what we teach, you know, when we're adults.
[00:09:14.900 --> 00:09:20.340]   And so we have a hard time receiving that which is free because it puts us in a position
[00:09:20.340 --> 00:09:21.340]   of humility.
[00:09:21.340 --> 00:09:24.540]   And we don't want to be humble.
[00:09:24.540 --> 00:09:29.700]   I remember years ago, it's been maybe about six, seven years now, you know, I was out
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:32.780]   in Santa Ana and I ran into this older gentleman.
[00:09:32.780 --> 00:09:37.220]   And he was probably maybe in his late 60s, early 70s.
[00:09:37.220 --> 00:09:41.180]   You know, I spent so much time out on the street talking to different guys and I know
[00:09:41.180 --> 00:09:46.060]   some guys were trying to, you know, they're trying to maneuver to kind of get stuff from
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.060]   you.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.180]   And, you know, I've been around that enough to kind of immediately like bells go off.
[00:09:50.180 --> 00:09:52.500]   But this guy was so genuine.
[00:09:52.500 --> 00:09:58.060]   I started talking to him and I found out that he was on disability and he didn't have his
[00:09:58.060 --> 00:09:59.060]   family around.
[00:09:59.060 --> 00:10:00.340]   He wasn't from this area.
[00:10:00.340 --> 00:10:03.900]   He moved out here, got disconnected with his family.
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:07.580]   And then he had a heart attack.
[00:10:07.580 --> 00:10:10.860]   And because he had a heart attack, he ended up in the hospital and he was there for about
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.860]   four or five months.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.100]   Well, while he was there, he couldn't follow up on his disability check.
[00:10:16.100 --> 00:10:19.540]   So he has to check in and fill out forms in every month.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:21.600]   And he couldn't do that for four or five months.
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:23.660]   So basically he got dropped.
[00:10:23.660 --> 00:10:27.340]   So by the time he was released in the hospital, he had to start this process over.
[00:10:27.340 --> 00:10:31.540]   But the problem was that process would take a minimum of six months.
[00:10:31.540 --> 00:10:34.860]   So he came out and he had to wait another six months.
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:39.660]   But the problem was the time I met him, it was very cold winter in California.
[00:10:39.660 --> 00:10:42.340]   It was like 52 degrees or something.
[00:10:42.340 --> 00:10:45.380]   It was like freezing weather.
[00:10:45.380 --> 00:10:48.940]   So anybody from outside of California, you might laugh at that, but it was a pretty cold
[00:10:48.940 --> 00:10:51.780]   winter, before California winter.
[00:10:51.780 --> 00:10:54.820]   And I could tell he had bronchitis and he was coughing.
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:56.020]   And so he was sitting on the side.
[00:10:56.020 --> 00:10:58.820]   So I started having conversation and we talked together.
[00:10:58.820 --> 00:11:00.140]   And so I thought, you know what?
[00:11:00.140 --> 00:11:03.420]   Maybe I can, you know, I don't know if I can help you for six months, but if I can
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:09.740]   take you and put you in a motel down the street here, that maybe when the weather gets better,
[00:11:09.740 --> 00:11:10.740]   you know, we'll see.
[00:11:10.740 --> 00:11:13.580]   Maybe I can find some more funds, but maybe when the weather gets better, you can kind
[00:11:13.580 --> 00:11:15.820]   of, you know, see what's going to happen.
[00:11:15.820 --> 00:11:19.380]   And so literally I had to beg him to come with me because he was like, "No, no, no,
[00:11:19.380 --> 00:11:20.380]   I don't want to do that.
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:22.340]   It's going to cost too much money."
[00:11:22.340 --> 00:11:23.980]   And you know, coughing the whole time.
[00:11:23.980 --> 00:11:26.060]   I said, "No, no, don't worry about it.
[00:11:26.060 --> 00:11:27.220]   It's not going to cost much money."
[00:11:27.220 --> 00:11:31.500]   And I, you know, I know a motel down the street here and it's not too far from here, about
[00:11:31.500 --> 00:11:33.060]   a two mile drive from here.
[00:11:33.060 --> 00:11:35.180]   I said, "Well, it's not going to be expensive.
[00:11:35.180 --> 00:11:39.420]   They have a special discount, you know, on a weekly basis and sometimes a month."
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:43.540]   And so I literally dragged him and dropped him off, you know, and then I would come visit
[00:11:43.540 --> 00:11:46.620]   him every other day or something and bring groceries and do what I have to do.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:51.300]   But the whole time I would see him, he would say, "Oh, no, Peter, that's not, I just,
[00:11:51.300 --> 00:11:52.860]   you know, don't bring anything.
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:53.860]   Don't do this."
[00:11:53.860 --> 00:11:54.860]   And how bad he felt.
[00:11:54.980 --> 00:11:57.940]   So literally, I was like, I was just, every time I was like, "Don't worry about it, you
[00:11:57.940 --> 00:11:59.180]   know, it's not a lot of money.
[00:11:59.180 --> 00:12:00.180]   Don't worry about it."
[00:12:00.180 --> 00:12:02.700]   And I would try to encourage him to stay.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:08.500]   Well, that process went on probably about two, two and a half weeks.
[00:12:08.500 --> 00:12:13.300]   And then all of a sudden, I go over to check up on him and he's not there.
[00:12:13.300 --> 00:12:14.300]   So I said, "What's going on?"
[00:12:14.300 --> 00:12:17.060]   And I went down to the office and he said, "Oh, the old man, his name was Robert.
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:19.180]   He said he checked out."
[00:12:19.180 --> 00:12:20.700]   And I said, "Oh my gosh, what happened?"
[00:12:20.700 --> 00:12:22.740]   You know, and finally he did it.
[00:12:22.740 --> 00:12:30.460]   And then I checked my message, phone, but it wasn't, it wasn't this phone now.
[00:12:30.460 --> 00:12:32.380]   I mean, it was just, that's just my message.
[00:12:32.380 --> 00:12:37.620]   And then he left a message on my answering machine, message, whatever, answering machine,
[00:12:37.620 --> 00:12:38.620]   whatever.
[00:12:38.620 --> 00:12:43.740]   So he left a message on there and I was playing it and he was choking up and crying the whole
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.740]   time.
[00:12:44.740 --> 00:12:49.900]   And, you know, Esther remembers we're talking about it and, and he was crying and he was
[00:12:49.900 --> 00:12:51.780]   saying, you know, "Thank you, Peter, for what you've done."
[00:12:51.780 --> 00:12:54.500]   And, you know, "Nobody's ever done this to me, done this for me."
[00:12:54.500 --> 00:12:58.340]   And it really wasn't a lot of money, but he says, "Nobody's ever done it, but I can't
[00:12:58.340 --> 00:12:59.340]   accept this anymore.
[00:12:59.340 --> 00:13:00.940]   I just feel, I just can't rest.
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:04.820]   I can't, I feel guilty taking your money.
[00:13:04.820 --> 00:13:07.340]   And so, you know, thank you for what you did.
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.500]   I'm not, I'm, you know, I'm not going to forget you."
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:12.620]   And then he just took off and I never ran into him again.
[00:13:12.620 --> 00:13:13.940]   It was a very short period of time.
[00:13:13.940 --> 00:13:17.820]   It was, I was probably maybe three, three weeks I spent with him.
[00:13:17.820 --> 00:13:23.340]   But during that three weeks, I mean, this was such a kind old man and just ran into
[00:13:23.340 --> 00:13:28.300]   certain circumstances and, and he just, you know, and it broke my heart when I found out
[00:13:28.300 --> 00:13:29.300]   he just left.
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:32.900]   And it was, again, it was in the cold middle of winter.
[00:13:32.900 --> 00:13:36.580]   And I was thinking about that and it's like, you know, we would look at that and say, "Well,
[00:13:36.580 --> 00:13:41.020]   that's an honorable thing that he just doesn't want to hand out."
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:42.860]   Because everybody else is like, "Gimme, gimme, gimme."
[00:13:42.860 --> 00:13:44.700]   But it's like, "No, no, I'm going to earn my way.
[00:13:44.700 --> 00:13:47.580]   Even if I'm homeless, I don't want a handout."
[00:13:47.580 --> 00:13:50.420]   And we may look at that and say, "Oh, that's an honorable guy and all the more why we want
[00:13:50.420 --> 00:13:51.420]   to help him."
[00:13:51.420 --> 00:13:54.900]   See, but that's us.
[00:13:54.900 --> 00:13:59.340]   There's some, some people who receive the grace of God and say, "Okay, gimme, you know,
[00:13:59.340 --> 00:14:01.420]   if it's free, just gimme all of it."
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:04.580]   And we don't think too deeply about what that is.
[00:14:04.580 --> 00:14:08.260]   And then there's some of us who receive it, but, you know, it's received by confession.
[00:14:08.260 --> 00:14:11.540]   But every part of us is kind of like, "I, this is not good.
[00:14:11.540 --> 00:14:15.420]   I need to earn some of it."
[00:14:15.420 --> 00:14:22.260]   And how that deeply hinders not only our appreciation of what it is that we have, but us coming
[00:14:22.260 --> 00:14:23.260]   to him.
[00:14:23.260 --> 00:14:30.340]   See, what Paul's been laying out for the first three chapters and on, he begins in verse
[00:14:30.340 --> 00:14:32.420]   27, it says, "Then what becomes of boasting?"
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:34.820]   He says, "It is excluded."
[00:14:34.820 --> 00:14:38.500]   It is excluded.
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:43.140]   How pride ruins everything.
[00:14:43.140 --> 00:14:47.100]   It really ruins everything.
[00:14:47.100 --> 00:14:52.380]   You know, those of you who have children, you know, we can recognize pride immediately
[00:14:52.380 --> 00:14:55.700]   because, you know, we're always comparing our children with other children.
[00:14:55.700 --> 00:14:58.340]   It's like, "Oh, man, he grew an inch.
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.340]   He's so tall.
[00:14:59.340 --> 00:15:01.980]   Look how big that kid is."
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:06.420]   We even compare the size of our, the kid's poop, like, "What?
[00:15:06.420 --> 00:15:08.500]   He's doing what?
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:10.620]   Your kid slept four hours?
[00:15:10.620 --> 00:15:12.420]   My kid slept six hours."
[00:15:12.420 --> 00:15:13.420]   Right?
[00:15:13.420 --> 00:15:15.220]   It's like, "Oh, he's so athletic.
[00:15:15.220 --> 00:15:16.220]   Look at this.
[00:15:16.220 --> 00:15:17.780]   Look how sharp his nose is.
[00:15:17.780 --> 00:15:21.220]   He knows the multiplication at that age?"
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:26.300]   And instead of appreciating the various gifts and various talents of other children, you
[00:15:26.300 --> 00:15:30.020]   know, like deep inside, we're like, "What's wrong with my kid?
[00:15:30.020 --> 00:15:31.740]   Why isn't my kid doing that?"
[00:15:31.740 --> 00:15:32.740]   You know?
[00:15:32.740 --> 00:15:34.700]   At the core of it, it's pride.
[00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:38.060]   You know, we're perfectly fine until we see what other people make.
[00:15:38.060 --> 00:15:42.100]   You know, we're perfectly fine with our car, and then all of a sudden we see what other
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:44.100]   people drive.
[00:15:44.100 --> 00:15:47.580]   And this inner need to compete.
[00:15:47.580 --> 00:15:50.660]   And at the core of it, it's pride.
[00:15:50.660 --> 00:16:00.620]   And see, pride is at the core of every corruption that you and I experience.
[00:16:00.620 --> 00:16:06.460]   In the very beginning, when Adam and Eve was tempted, Satan said to Eve, "If you eat of
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:08.540]   this," what did he say?
[00:16:08.540 --> 00:16:12.540]   "You will be like God."
[00:16:12.540 --> 00:16:13.540]   That was the temptation.
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:14.540]   It wasn't that they didn't have food.
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:16.820]   It wasn't like they were so hungry they needed to have food.
[00:16:16.820 --> 00:16:19.580]   The whole Garden of Eden was filled with food.
[00:16:19.580 --> 00:16:23.980]   It wasn't the only attractive fruit.
[00:16:23.980 --> 00:16:26.460]   The promise was, "If you eat of this, your eyes are going to be opened.
[00:16:26.460 --> 00:16:27.780]   You're going to be like God."
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:30.660]   That's why they ate of that tree.
[00:16:30.660 --> 00:16:38.900]   And ever since then, man's primary motive is self-exaltation, self-determination.
[00:16:38.900 --> 00:16:40.940]   It's about self, self-glorification.
[00:16:40.940 --> 00:16:43.560]   That's why we work hard at school.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.420]   We raise our children to be better.
[00:16:46.420 --> 00:16:48.200]   That's why we work hard to get ahead.
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:50.220]   We make more money.
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:53.180]   That every part of us, we work out.
[00:16:53.180 --> 00:16:57.180]   You know, the time that we spent, the way we present ourselves, all of a sudden is so
[00:16:57.180 --> 00:17:01.340]   that we could be better than what's around us.
[00:17:01.340 --> 00:17:07.560]   Not realizing that this rat race is at the core of what's killing us.
[00:17:07.560 --> 00:17:09.140]   It's at the core of what's killing us.
[00:17:09.140 --> 00:17:12.980]   It's slowly deteriorating who we are.
[00:17:12.980 --> 00:17:15.140]   It affects our marriage.
[00:17:15.140 --> 00:17:17.180]   It affects our friendship.
[00:17:17.180 --> 00:17:18.960]   And it affects the church.
[00:17:18.960 --> 00:17:23.660]   We have a church filled with people who believe that they are better than other people or
[00:17:23.660 --> 00:17:26.200]   that they're worse than other people.
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:27.740]   And they just can't get satisfied.
[00:17:27.740 --> 00:17:30.440]   And you have frustrated people.
[00:17:30.440 --> 00:17:33.200]   And it affects everything.
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:38.940]   That's why when Jesus came, he did exactly the opposite.
[00:17:38.940 --> 00:17:43.420]   You know, the whole Jewish system, the law was given to them to humble them so that they
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:44.420]   would bring them to Christ.
[00:17:44.420 --> 00:17:49.220]   Instead, they used it as a system of hierarchy, like who's better, who's closer to God.
[00:17:49.220 --> 00:17:53.020]   So when Jesus Christ came, he came completely outside.
[00:17:53.020 --> 00:17:54.020]   He didn't go to the temple.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.500]   He didn't go to Jerusalem.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:57.820]   He was born in a strange city.
[00:17:57.820 --> 00:18:03.900]   And then he started collecting disciples from the city of Galilee, a town known for fishing.
[00:18:03.900 --> 00:18:07.260]   Not known for temple worship or sacrifice.
[00:18:07.260 --> 00:18:10.940]   Just fishermen and tax collectors.
[00:18:10.940 --> 00:18:14.780]   And he gathered a bunch of these people who had been utterly rejected by the religious
[00:18:14.780 --> 00:18:16.160]   system.
[00:18:16.160 --> 00:18:18.940]   But he deliberately did that.
[00:18:18.940 --> 00:18:25.780]   And the whole reason why he did that was because at the very core of what's corrupting mankind,
[00:18:25.780 --> 00:18:30.820]   it's its innate desire, knee-jerk reaction to self-glorify themselves, even in the context
[00:18:30.820 --> 00:18:33.860]   of worshiping God.
[00:18:33.860 --> 00:18:37.380]   Even in the context of preaching the gospel.
[00:18:37.380 --> 00:18:40.060]   Even in the context of serving one another.
[00:18:40.060 --> 00:18:43.140]   We self-glorify ourselves.
[00:18:43.140 --> 00:18:48.220]   And so Jesus comes in completely outside the box.
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:52.700]   You ever wonder, you get Apostle Paul.
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:56.820]   Apostle Paul was a celebrity among the Jews.
[00:18:56.820 --> 00:19:03.820]   When he was under trial, King Felix said, "Your great learning has made you mad."
[00:19:03.820 --> 00:19:06.900]   A king already knew who Paul was.
[00:19:06.900 --> 00:19:09.420]   Even before he came in front of it, he knew who he was.
[00:19:09.420 --> 00:19:11.240]   Because he was famous.
[00:19:11.240 --> 00:19:14.700]   He was possibly a member of the Sanhedrin, possibly.
[00:19:14.700 --> 00:19:19.100]   At the minimum, he was a direct disciple of Gamaliel.
[00:19:19.100 --> 00:19:22.820]   And yet, when he became a Christian, what happens?
[00:19:22.820 --> 00:19:24.220]   He doesn't, God doesn't say, "You know what?
[00:19:24.220 --> 00:19:25.220]   Let's use that.
[00:19:25.220 --> 00:19:29.020]   Let's use his position and preach the gospel."
[00:19:29.020 --> 00:19:31.460]   I mean, wouldn't that be great?
[00:19:31.460 --> 00:19:37.740]   Today we're in the middle of election season, and everybody is pretending to be Christian,
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.860]   right?
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:40.940]   Because that's the only way you're going to be elected.
[00:19:40.940 --> 00:19:45.580]   Then there's a part of all of us thinking, "Oh, only if we can get a real Christian in
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:47.700]   the office, things can happen."
[00:19:47.700 --> 00:19:48.700]   Right?
[00:19:48.700 --> 00:19:53.180]   Man, the highest office in the United States, only if a real Christian, right?
[00:19:53.180 --> 00:19:58.220]   Because we think that that person could be useful, or maybe a movie star.
[00:19:58.220 --> 00:19:59.220]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:59.220 --> 00:20:02.020]   Their famous movie star, and they say, "Yeah, you know, Jesus and me, like that."
[00:20:02.020 --> 00:20:04.020]   He's a Christian.
[00:20:04.020 --> 00:20:05.020]   Revival!
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:06.020]   Right?
[00:20:06.020 --> 00:20:10.180]   Or a basketball athlete, you know, talks about, "I want to thank my Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:20:10.180 --> 00:20:11.180]   Yes!
[00:20:11.180 --> 00:20:12.180]   Revival!
[00:20:12.180 --> 00:20:13.180]   Right?
[00:20:13.180 --> 00:20:17.140]   Somebody of significance, somebody of power, who's confessing to be a Christian.
[00:20:17.140 --> 00:20:21.020]   Now they're going to make a mark on Christianity.
[00:20:21.020 --> 00:20:23.980]   Apostle Paul was a celebrity.
[00:20:23.980 --> 00:20:25.260]   Apostle Paul was educated.
[00:20:25.260 --> 00:20:26.700]   Apostle Paul had position.
[00:20:26.700 --> 00:20:28.940]   Jews looked up to him.
[00:20:28.940 --> 00:20:33.940]   A Pharisee would have worked all his life just to be where he was.
[00:20:33.940 --> 00:20:39.540]   Yet he encounters Jesus on the road to Damascus, and then, you know what happens to him?
[00:20:39.540 --> 00:20:45.340]   He becomes a tent maker.
[00:20:45.340 --> 00:20:52.100]   I'll bet you that man has never made a tent in his life until he met Christ.
[00:20:52.100 --> 00:20:53.100]   I'll bet you he never.
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.260]   I'll bet you he wasn't a tent maker by trade before he met Christ.
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.820]   Because this guy was born with a silver spoon in his mouth.
[00:20:58.820 --> 00:20:59.940]   He was a Roman citizen.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:01.220]   He had money.
[00:21:01.220 --> 00:21:04.740]   You know, you don't become a disciple of Gamaliel living on a farm.
[00:21:04.740 --> 00:21:10.500]   His dad was probably a very wealthy, very wealthy Jewish businessman.
[00:21:10.500 --> 00:21:13.780]   And then he meets Christ, and then he gets thrown out of that.
[00:21:13.780 --> 00:21:18.700]   Thrown out of the Pharisaic system, thrown out of the temple, thrown out of the thing
[00:21:18.700 --> 00:21:24.140]   that he's, him and his dad may have been working for all his life, and all of a sudden, you
[00:21:24.140 --> 00:21:25.140]   know, he's writing Philippians.
[00:21:25.140 --> 00:21:30.980]   I know how it is to be content in every and all situation, whether I have a lot or a little.
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:31.980]   Right?
[00:21:31.980 --> 00:21:35.300]   Why don't you just use him in that position?
[00:21:35.300 --> 00:21:36.460]   That's what we would think.
[00:21:36.460 --> 00:21:42.100]   If he was a person of prominence, wouldn't God be able to use that?
[00:21:42.100 --> 00:21:45.700]   Why did he take him out of that and make him nothing?
[00:21:45.700 --> 00:21:51.020]   Why waste all of that energy, all of that prestige, all of that honor that he was getting
[00:21:51.020 --> 00:21:57.620]   from the Jewish community, and then make him start as almost like a peasant?
[00:21:57.620 --> 00:22:04.340]   Because the whole system of corruption of mankind is about self-elevation.
[00:22:04.340 --> 00:22:14.020]   Jesus came as a carpenter to a family of no significance, lived most of his life in Galilee,
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:18.220]   did most of his ministry in Galilee with a bunch of fishermen who, again, were of no
[00:22:18.220 --> 00:22:20.660]   prominence.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:25.700]   Scripture says the Lion of Judah came as a Lamb of God.
[00:22:25.700 --> 00:22:34.460]   A lion, the lion turned into a lamb to be a sacrifice for us.
[00:22:34.460 --> 00:22:39.060]   It goes against everything that you and I are taught to pursue.
[00:22:39.060 --> 00:22:43.340]   See, the Gospel message flips the world upside down.
[00:22:43.340 --> 00:22:46.900]   It is not simply a change of direction.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:51.740]   See, the repentance that leads to salvation isn't simply, "You know what?
[00:22:51.740 --> 00:22:54.180]   I've been cheating.
[00:22:54.180 --> 00:22:55.180]   And I've been lying.
[00:22:55.180 --> 00:22:56.180]   And I've been struggling with purity.
[00:22:56.180 --> 00:22:57.780]   And so I repent of these things."
[00:22:57.780 --> 00:23:02.780]   See, repentance basically is recognizing our whole life and our whole being that I've been
[00:23:02.780 --> 00:23:06.180]   headed the wrong direction.
[00:23:06.180 --> 00:23:10.140]   Every thought that I had, every desire, what I thought to be right and wrong, it was all
[00:23:10.140 --> 00:23:13.140]   wrong.
[00:23:13.140 --> 00:23:19.820]   And so when we encounter Jesus Christ, it all changes.
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:21.460]   Not just the way we speak.
[00:23:21.460 --> 00:23:25.060]   Not just the way we do taxes.
[00:23:25.060 --> 00:23:26.060]   We completely change.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:27.700]   We're born again.
[00:23:27.700 --> 00:23:32.140]   In Isaiah 53, 2-3 it says, "For He grew up before Him like a young plant and like a root
[00:23:32.140 --> 00:23:33.900]   out of the dry ground.
[00:23:33.900 --> 00:23:40.060]   He had no form or majesty that we should look at Him, and no beauty that we should desire
[00:23:40.060 --> 00:23:41.060]   Him."
[00:23:41.060 --> 00:23:42.940]   There was nothing attractive about Him.
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:49.100]   You would think, you know, He could have come as the handsomest man, the tallest man, the
[00:23:49.100 --> 00:23:55.460]   most athletic man, the most built, strongest, most intelligent, because some of that would
[00:23:55.460 --> 00:23:56.780]   attract some people to Him.
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:24:01.160]   But He said, "No, He came as nothing, no beauty.
[00:24:01.160 --> 00:24:05.420]   He was despised and He was rejected by men, a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.940]   and as one from whom men hide their faces."
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:15.780]   There's nothing about Him that a natural man would be attracted to.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:19.780]   Not the world, the same things that attract us to movie stars and basketball stars.
[00:24:19.780 --> 00:24:22.580]   He had none of that.
[00:24:22.580 --> 00:24:23.580]   Nothing external.
[00:24:23.580 --> 00:24:27.940]   Yet He was despised and He was esteemed.
[00:24:27.940 --> 00:24:31.500]   And not only did He come that way, He said, "If you want to follow Me, you pick up your
[00:24:31.500 --> 00:24:34.400]   cross."
[00:24:34.400 --> 00:24:42.420]   Not only am I going to die, if you want to live the life that you're pursuing, the life
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:50.940]   that you've been laboring to pursue, you must also die to that, because that's what's killing
[00:24:50.940 --> 00:24:51.940]   you.
[00:24:51.940 --> 00:24:55.540]   Hebrews chapter 13, 12, 14 talks about Jesus.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:25:00.380]   It says, "So Jesus also suffered outside the gate in order to sanctify the people through
[00:25:00.380 --> 00:25:01.380]   His own blood."
[00:25:01.380 --> 00:25:07.320]   You know what it means in the Scripture to be outside the gate?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:13.280]   If you're punished inside the gate, you're punished and hopefully that you would repent,
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:16.640]   and that you would still be inside the gate, it's really for your benefit.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:21.680]   But when somebody's taken outside the gate, you are banished from the city.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:28.280]   And only the worst of criminals, only somebody who has committed the worst infraction of
[00:25:28.280 --> 00:25:33.760]   the law would be taken outside the court and they would usually be stoned.
[00:25:33.760 --> 00:25:37.740]   So when the Scripture says that Jesus was taken outside the gate, it meant that He was
[00:25:37.740 --> 00:25:41.420]   utterly rejected by His own people.
[00:25:41.420 --> 00:25:47.300]   He says, "Therefore, let us go to Him outside the camp."
[00:25:47.300 --> 00:25:50.180]   Outside the camp.
[00:25:50.180 --> 00:25:58.040]   How counterproductive and counterintuitive it is for us to try so hard to build a life
[00:25:58.040 --> 00:26:02.540]   inside the camp when Jesus went outside.
[00:26:02.540 --> 00:26:05.140]   And He calls us to come out.
[00:26:05.140 --> 00:26:07.340]   And isn't that what He said?
[00:26:07.340 --> 00:26:13.260]   If you find your life, if you seek your life, what did He say?
[00:26:13.260 --> 00:26:15.900]   You will lose it.
[00:26:15.900 --> 00:26:19.360]   Now that doesn't mean that if you live selfishly, self-exaltation, that one day you're going
[00:26:19.360 --> 00:26:21.580]   to wake up and you're going to die early.
[00:26:21.580 --> 00:26:23.100]   No.
[00:26:23.100 --> 00:26:28.300]   The very thing that you think is going to cause life is actually causing death.
[00:26:28.300 --> 00:26:31.660]   And He calls us to come outside.
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:38.380]   If you think about even the symbol of the cross and what that signified at that particular
[00:26:38.380 --> 00:26:39.380]   time.
[00:26:39.380 --> 00:26:45.380]   Today, every once in a while, you'll see a hideous image of an ISIS terrorist with a
[00:26:45.380 --> 00:26:50.700]   beheaded, somebody's head who's beheaded and they would raise it up for people to see and
[00:26:50.700 --> 00:26:53.460]   they're flaunting it with everyone and we're disgusted.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:58.300]   The whole purpose of why they're doing that is to basically serve as a threat to anybody
[00:26:58.300 --> 00:26:59.300]   else who messes with them.
[00:26:59.300 --> 00:27:00.980]   You get in our way, this is what's going to happen.
[00:27:00.980 --> 00:27:04.040]   If you don't submit to us, this is what's going to happen.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:12.180]   And as disgusting as that is, that is their goal, is to bring fear and threat and humiliation
[00:27:12.180 --> 00:27:16.540]   and dominance over anybody who watches that.
[00:27:16.540 --> 00:27:21.300]   Well the cross served the same purpose for the people who created it.
[00:27:21.300 --> 00:27:24.660]   It wasn't simply a capital punishment.
[00:27:24.660 --> 00:27:29.340]   It was to serve to humiliate whoever went against, and at that particular time, the
[00:27:29.340 --> 00:27:30.340]   Roman government.
[00:27:30.340 --> 00:27:33.260]   So they didn't even carry that out with their own citizens.
[00:27:33.260 --> 00:27:35.540]   Only foreigners were put on the cross.
[00:27:35.540 --> 00:27:39.740]   And the whole purpose of that, one, is to humiliate you.
[00:27:39.740 --> 00:27:43.780]   So the first thing that they would do is strip you naked.
[00:27:43.780 --> 00:27:48.020]   Now I know we have pictures, we have images of Jesus on the cross and he's usually well
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:52.380]   covered for modesty purposes.
[00:27:52.380 --> 00:27:57.740]   But the actual crucifixion, the first thing that they did was to strip you naked.
[00:27:57.740 --> 00:28:00.780]   This all happened publicly.
[00:28:00.780 --> 00:28:03.460]   It doesn't matter how rich you are.
[00:28:03.460 --> 00:28:05.860]   It doesn't matter how educated you are.
[00:28:05.860 --> 00:28:09.740]   It doesn't matter what kind of family background you are.
[00:28:09.740 --> 00:28:14.780]   Once they strip you naked, there is no pride.
[00:28:14.780 --> 00:28:18.460]   Once they completely take that away from you, you're standing in front of a crowd, stripped
[00:28:18.460 --> 00:28:19.980]   absolutely naked.
[00:28:19.980 --> 00:28:23.660]   Whatever was important to you is no longer important to you.
[00:28:23.660 --> 00:28:26.900]   That was the beginning of the crucifixion.
[00:28:26.900 --> 00:28:30.580]   And then they would mock you, and you know the beating process.
[00:28:30.580 --> 00:28:34.700]   And the whole purpose of that is after they beat him, they give just enough life, give
[00:28:34.700 --> 00:28:42.660]   up just enough energy so that he would hang on that cross, sometimes 7, 8, 9, 10 days.
[00:28:42.660 --> 00:28:47.820]   So that every human being, everybody in that area that would walk by this cross, that this
[00:28:47.820 --> 00:28:53.860]   cross and that person's humiliation and that person's suffering would serve as a reminder
[00:28:53.860 --> 00:28:55.620]   to anybody, "You messed with us.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:59.260]   This happens to you."
[00:28:59.260 --> 00:29:07.140]   When a nation chooses to have a symbol on their flag, we choose what is good, what is
[00:29:07.140 --> 00:29:08.140]   powerful.
[00:29:08.140 --> 00:29:12.020]   So in the United States, they chose the stars that represent the colonies, the states, and
[00:29:12.020 --> 00:29:13.980]   eventually it became 50 states.
[00:29:13.980 --> 00:29:20.100]   And so we have that because what we're saying is that collectively, all these states collectively,
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:21.180]   we are powerful together.
[00:29:21.180 --> 00:29:24.380]   It's almost like having 50 nations together as one.
[00:29:24.380 --> 00:29:27.060]   And so our flag represents that.
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:30.420]   The Russian flag has the hammer and sickle, the communist symbol.
[00:29:30.420 --> 00:29:33.620]   And basically what that means is the power of the people.
[00:29:33.620 --> 00:29:39.420]   The people have collectively got together, and so we're strong in this way.
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:44.300]   But the symbol, the banner that every Christian is under is the cross.
[00:29:44.300 --> 00:29:51.100]   Symbol of humiliation, symbol of suffering, symbol of rejection, symbol that takes us
[00:29:51.100 --> 00:29:54.220]   outside the camp.
[00:29:54.220 --> 00:30:01.940]   And it is an absolute oxymoron for Christians to be under this banner and to be pursuing
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.740]   our own life.
[00:30:04.740 --> 00:30:12.300]   Everything about justification by faith screams out, "Be quiet."
[00:30:12.300 --> 00:30:14.740]   We have no power but His power.
[00:30:14.740 --> 00:30:19.540]   That's why Paul says in Galatians 6, 14, "But far be it from me to boast except in the cross
[00:30:19.540 --> 00:30:26.860]   of our Lord Jesus Christ, by which the world has been crucified to me and I to the world."
[00:30:26.860 --> 00:30:30.180]   We have been crucified with Christ.
[00:30:30.180 --> 00:30:34.340]   Now let me stop here for a second.
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.380]   This is nothing new to you.
[00:30:36.380 --> 00:30:38.600]   This is nothing new to you.
[00:30:38.600 --> 00:30:40.140]   Justification by faith is not anything new to you.
[00:30:40.140 --> 00:30:44.220]   You've probably heard it hundreds of times.
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.620]   The question that he's trying to answer is, if that's the case, if salvation is by faith
[00:30:47.620 --> 00:30:50.620]   alone in verse 31, then do we overthrow the law?
[00:30:50.620 --> 00:30:52.940]   Then what is the purpose of the law?
[00:30:52.940 --> 00:30:55.500]   Do we need the law?
[00:30:55.500 --> 00:31:01.340]   It's about what he did, what we do doesn't matter, so therefore why even talk about it?
[00:31:01.340 --> 00:31:04.060]   He says, if that's the case, is that the case?
[00:31:04.060 --> 00:31:07.860]   If salvation by faith alone doesn't nullify the law, what is the answer?
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.220]   By no means.
[00:31:10.220 --> 00:31:15.420]   Not only does it not nullify the law, it says on the contrary, we uphold the law.
[00:31:15.420 --> 00:31:17.260]   We establish the law.
[00:31:17.260 --> 00:31:22.820]   Again, a superficial, cheap understanding of grace stops right there and it's like,
[00:31:22.820 --> 00:31:26.660]   "Oh, we're saved by grace, so let's just, you know, how, as long as I feel love for
[00:31:26.660 --> 00:31:28.540]   him in here, it doesn't matter."
[00:31:28.540 --> 00:31:31.500]   But he says, no, by no means.
[00:31:31.500 --> 00:31:32.900]   Romans 6, 1 and 2.
[00:31:32.900 --> 00:31:33.900]   What shall we say then?
[00:31:33.900 --> 00:31:37.580]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:31:37.580 --> 00:31:42.380]   If my sin highlights his grace, then do we just keep sinning and then that just kind
[00:31:42.380 --> 00:31:43.380]   of highlights his grace?
[00:31:43.380 --> 00:31:45.900]   By no means.
[00:31:45.900 --> 00:31:51.540]   How can we who die to sin still live in it?
[00:31:51.540 --> 00:31:54.620]   Inconsistent with the very salvation that we profess.
[00:31:54.620 --> 00:31:59.600]   In fact, Ephesians 2.10, he says, "For we are his workmanship, created in Christ Jesus
[00:31:59.600 --> 00:32:02.660]   for good works."
[00:32:02.660 --> 00:32:04.380]   He saved us for good works.
[00:32:04.380 --> 00:32:06.140]   He didn't save us by good works.
[00:32:06.140 --> 00:32:10.860]   He says he saved us for good works, which God prepared beforehand that we should walk
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:11.860]   in him.
[00:32:11.860 --> 00:32:18.980]   Diederik Bonhoeffer says of this cheap grace, "Cheap grace is a grace we bestow on ourselves.
[00:32:18.980 --> 00:32:22.860]   It is not the grace that God has given.
[00:32:22.860 --> 00:32:27.780]   Cheap grace is the preaching of forgiveness without repentance.
[00:32:27.780 --> 00:32:31.220]   Cheap grace is baptism without church discipline.
[00:32:31.220 --> 00:32:35.460]   Cheap grace is communion without genuine confession.
[00:32:35.460 --> 00:32:41.220]   Cheap grace is grace without discipleship, grace without the cross, grace without Jesus
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:46.620]   Christ living and incarnate."
[00:32:46.620 --> 00:32:50.620]   Genuine faith does not abolish the law.
[00:32:50.620 --> 00:32:53.740]   It actually establishes the law.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:58.060]   And let me make that very clear in case anyone is confused, because there's some confusion
[00:32:58.060 --> 00:33:00.300]   language in our generation.
[00:33:00.300 --> 00:33:05.900]   That somehow if you're gospel-centered that we don't need to focus on pursuing righteousness
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.460]   and holiness.
[00:33:08.460 --> 00:33:10.140]   Scripture is absolutely crystal clear.
[00:33:10.140 --> 00:33:11.540]   He says, "Do we nullify the law?
[00:33:11.540 --> 00:33:12.540]   By no means.
[00:33:12.540 --> 00:33:16.580]   On the contrary, we establish the law."
[00:33:16.580 --> 00:33:21.420]   When you look at the way Jesus looked at people, he distinguished between three different kinds
[00:33:21.420 --> 00:33:22.540]   of faith.
[00:33:22.540 --> 00:33:24.660]   No faith, right?
[00:33:24.660 --> 00:33:26.460]   People who had no faith utterly just rejected him.
[00:33:26.460 --> 00:33:28.540]   They heard the Word of God and said, "I don't believe this guy.
[00:33:28.540 --> 00:33:30.180]   Let's crucify him."
[00:33:30.180 --> 00:33:32.300]   And then there was little faith.
[00:33:32.300 --> 00:33:36.060]   That his disciples when the storm came, they were anxious and said, "Hey, Jesus, do you
[00:33:36.060 --> 00:33:37.060]   care that we're going to die?"
[00:33:37.060 --> 00:33:38.060]   He wakes up.
[00:33:38.060 --> 00:33:39.060]   Remember the first thing he says?
[00:33:39.060 --> 00:33:41.780]   "Ye of little faith."
[00:33:41.780 --> 00:33:46.100]   He saw their anxiousness and he said, "Hey, you need to be, you need to suck it up, man."
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:49.140]   No, he says, he looks right through that and says, "It's because you have little faith.
[00:33:49.140 --> 00:33:51.820]   You don't know who I am."
[00:33:51.820 --> 00:33:56.060]   Remember that when the disciple, when Peter's walking on the water and he's, "Let me come
[00:33:56.060 --> 00:33:57.060]   to you."
[00:33:57.060 --> 00:33:58.900]   And as he's coming, the storm comes and he begins to sink.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:02.660]   Jesus raises him up and he says, "Ye of little faith."
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:07.180]   In other words, their life and their anxiousness was evidence of the kind of faith that they
[00:34:07.180 --> 00:34:08.180]   had.
[00:34:08.180 --> 00:34:11.540]   And then he would encounter some Gentiles.
[00:34:11.540 --> 00:34:13.460]   And he was amazed by their great faith.
[00:34:13.460 --> 00:34:14.700]   Remember the centurion?
[00:34:14.700 --> 00:34:16.980]   He comes and he says, "I have a servant who's sick."
[00:34:16.980 --> 00:34:18.260]   And Jesus says, "Well, where is he?"
[00:34:18.260 --> 00:34:20.340]   And he said, "Oh, you don't need to come.
[00:34:20.340 --> 00:34:23.180]   I have many servants myself and if I just tell them to go, they'll do it.
[00:34:23.180 --> 00:34:27.460]   So you're powerful and you're, you know, clearly you're a prophet.
[00:34:27.460 --> 00:34:29.100]   Just send somebody."
[00:34:29.100 --> 00:34:33.420]   And Jesus says he was amazed because he saw great faith.
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.940]   Same thing with the Gentile woman that comes, the Canaanite woman said, "You know, my daughter
[00:34:37.940 --> 00:34:38.940]   is sick."
[00:34:38.940 --> 00:34:44.340]   And Jesus says, "It's not right for us to give to pagans, to pigs."
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:48.500]   And instead of being offended, she says, "Well, even the pigs, they take the scrap off of
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:50.580]   the master's table.
[00:34:50.580 --> 00:34:53.140]   So have mercy on me."
[00:34:53.140 --> 00:34:56.020]   She says, "You of great faith."
[00:34:56.020 --> 00:34:58.060]   So he saw right through that.
[00:34:58.060 --> 00:35:03.620]   See, faith, when it is genuine, always produces righteousness.
[00:35:03.620 --> 00:35:11.020]   Let me tell you, you know, like I had a conversation with an atheist.
[00:35:11.020 --> 00:35:15.740]   And again, this is a common conversation that I have with an atheist.
[00:35:15.740 --> 00:35:19.580]   Typically the conversation would go, it's like, "Wow, you guys are based on faith.
[00:35:19.580 --> 00:35:20.580]   We're based on science.
[00:35:20.580 --> 00:35:23.860]   You know, your thing doesn't make any sense.
[00:35:23.860 --> 00:35:27.100]   So you have to make a leap of faith, even if it's completely nonsense, but we're dealing
[00:35:27.100 --> 00:35:28.100]   with facts."
[00:35:28.100 --> 00:35:32.260]   You know, and I've learned years ago, going out and talking to people that it doesn't
[00:35:32.260 --> 00:35:36.100]   do any good to get into this back and forth and like, who's right and who's wrong.
[00:35:36.100 --> 00:35:40.060]   So usually when they get like that, I just sit there and I just ask questions, you know,
[00:35:40.060 --> 00:35:41.060]   and say, "Oh, it's like that.
[00:35:41.060 --> 00:35:42.060]   So where did that come from?"
[00:35:42.060 --> 00:35:44.660]   And so, "Well, you know, from monkeys."
[00:35:44.660 --> 00:35:46.620]   And where a monkey comes, "Well, we are from Mamiba.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:47.620]   Where did that come from?"
[00:35:47.620 --> 00:35:48.620]   It was a big bang, you know.
[00:35:48.620 --> 00:35:49.620]   And so, "Where is that?"
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:52.660]   It was like, you know, there was matter that was there.
[00:35:52.660 --> 00:35:54.500]   What was there before that?
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:58.380]   Usually obviously you keep asking like, "I don't know."
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:02.660]   And the answer that they would give is, "Well, you don't know where that comes from.
[00:36:02.660 --> 00:36:06.100]   You're rejecting God because you don't know where he comes from, but you receive science."
[00:36:06.100 --> 00:36:10.340]   And I say, "Yeah, but I believe that one day that if we study enough, that science is going
[00:36:10.340 --> 00:36:13.340]   to teach us where we came from."
[00:36:13.340 --> 00:36:16.900]   It's like, "Okay, let me get this straight, okay.
[00:36:16.900 --> 00:36:19.460]   So you're rejecting God because you don't understand him.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.620]   You don't know where he comes from, what his origin is.
[00:36:21.620 --> 00:36:23.300]   And so, therefore, you reject him.
[00:36:23.300 --> 00:36:28.580]   So you say our faith in that is ridiculous, right?
[00:36:28.580 --> 00:36:31.740]   Sounds like to me you have faith in science.
[00:36:31.740 --> 00:36:37.060]   You don't know, you have no idea now, but you believe that if you stick with it long
[00:36:37.060 --> 00:36:40.180]   enough that science is going to answer all your questions.
[00:36:40.180 --> 00:36:41.740]   Am I right?"
[00:36:41.740 --> 00:36:43.380]   I say, "Yes."
[00:36:43.380 --> 00:36:46.260]   "So how is that not the same thing?"
[00:36:46.260 --> 00:36:48.460]   "It's just not."
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:50.740]   Usually that's where it ends.
[00:36:50.740 --> 00:36:51.740]   It's just it ends.
[00:36:51.740 --> 00:36:52.740]   You're stupid.
[00:36:52.740 --> 00:36:53.740]   The end.
[00:36:53.740 --> 00:36:54.740]   That's usually how it ends, right?
[00:36:54.740 --> 00:36:55.740]   They can call me stupid.
[00:36:55.740 --> 00:36:59.940]   I didn't call them stupid, right?
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:01.660]   Faith is the reason why we do everything.
[00:37:01.660 --> 00:37:07.860]   Let me just get to the application of that, okay?
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:09.500]   Today you came here by faith.
[00:37:09.500 --> 00:37:11.140]   If you didn't have faith, you wouldn't have been able to come here.
[00:37:11.140 --> 00:37:13.260]   Now I'm not talking about faith in Jesus.
[00:37:13.260 --> 00:37:20.120]   You got in your car and every time you crossed a green light, you had faith that the other
[00:37:20.120 --> 00:37:24.740]   driver that's coming on the other side was going to stop.
[00:37:24.740 --> 00:37:28.820]   And if you didn't believe that, you wouldn't have been able to come here.
[00:37:28.820 --> 00:37:33.180]   Because every time you see a green light, you're going to have to stop, right?
[00:37:33.180 --> 00:37:37.460]   Because I'm not sure if that guy, maybe he's a teenager, he's got a license, he can't determine
[00:37:37.460 --> 00:37:39.340]   what's red and green.
[00:37:39.340 --> 00:37:40.340]   Maybe that guy's colorblind.
[00:37:40.340 --> 00:37:43.300]   Maybe he just doesn't care, you know what I mean?
[00:37:43.300 --> 00:37:47.020]   But at some point you have to believe that these people are going to follow these rules
[00:37:47.020 --> 00:37:52.840]   and that's why you're able to drive through this thing or else you can't survive.
[00:37:52.840 --> 00:37:55.800]   Everything in life requires some kind of faith, right?
[00:37:55.800 --> 00:37:59.980]   You buy a house, the bank is taking a chance on you based upon your credit and all this
[00:37:59.980 --> 00:38:00.980]   stuff.
[00:38:00.980 --> 00:38:03.020]   They're taking a chance, okay, we believe that you're going to be faithful and you're
[00:38:03.020 --> 00:38:04.680]   going to pay this back based upon your credit.
[00:38:04.680 --> 00:38:07.660]   But in the end, there's nothing guaranteed.
[00:38:07.660 --> 00:38:09.460]   Everything in life depends on faith.
[00:38:09.460 --> 00:38:13.820]   But the question is, where is this faith, right?
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.540]   What is your faith and what does that lead to?
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:22.380]   So typically we think faith is just, oh okay, we feel it in here, so any pressure of application
[00:38:22.380 --> 00:38:24.580]   of this is legalism.
[00:38:24.580 --> 00:38:30.380]   If you read the whole book of Hebrews, Hebrews is a bunch of, at one point, professing Christians
[00:38:30.380 --> 00:38:36.020]   who are going back into Judaism, like into workspace salvation, and the author is trying
[00:38:36.020 --> 00:38:40.020]   to convince them, why would you go back to that when Jesus is superior to everything?
[00:38:40.020 --> 00:38:45.500]   And the whole point of Hebrews is justification by faith through the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:38:45.500 --> 00:38:47.020]   That's the whole point.
[00:38:47.020 --> 00:38:51.180]   You know, the difference between Romans and Hebrews is Romans is basically teaching us
[00:38:51.180 --> 00:38:56.860]   the essence of the gospel in detailed form, talking about the new covenant.
[00:38:56.860 --> 00:39:01.440]   Book of Hebrews teaches justification by faith in connection to the Old Testament.
[00:39:01.440 --> 00:39:04.180]   But at the end, the conclusion is the same.
[00:39:04.180 --> 00:39:05.980]   It's justification by faith alone.
[00:39:05.980 --> 00:39:10.200]   And both of these books dissect it in two different approaches.
[00:39:10.200 --> 00:39:15.300]   When we get to chapter 11 of the book of Hebrews, he's making a conclusion of justification
[00:39:15.300 --> 00:39:16.300]   by faith.
[00:39:16.300 --> 00:39:21.860]   And so, chapter 11 of Hebrews is the chapter of faith.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:25.980]   But here's what he says about faith, and I'm not going to read all of it, but highlight.
[00:39:25.980 --> 00:39:27.220]   Hebrews 11, 7.
[00:39:27.220 --> 00:39:34.540]   "It is by faith Noah, being warned by God concerning events as yet unseen, in reverent
[00:39:34.540 --> 00:39:38.660]   fear constructed an ark for the saving of his household."
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:44.900]   He said, faith caused Noah to believe in God, and that's why he did this ridiculous thing,
[00:39:44.900 --> 00:39:48.580]   building this ark in the middle of the desert for a hundred years.
[00:39:48.580 --> 00:39:52.700]   It wasn't his works, but it was faith that caused him to obey God.
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:53.700]   Same thing with Abraham.
[00:39:53.700 --> 00:39:54.700]   Hebrews 11, 8.
[00:39:54.700 --> 00:39:59.260]   "By faith Abraham obeyed when he was called to go out to a place that he was to receive
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:00.260]   as an inheritance."
[00:40:00.260 --> 00:40:04.140]   See, Abraham was already a rich man.
[00:40:04.140 --> 00:40:05.540]   And God said, "Well, do you believe?"
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:06.540]   And he said, "Yes, I believe."
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.540]   You know, "Then come out."
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:08.540]   He said, "Ah, I don't know.
[00:40:08.540 --> 00:40:09.980]   I'm already comfortable here."
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:10.980]   He said, "No."
[00:40:11.100 --> 00:40:12.100]   He said, "No."
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:13.100]   He said, "No."
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:16.300]   The reason he believed was because he believed in the promises of God that he followed.
[00:40:16.300 --> 00:40:20.420]   So his actions were evidence that he had genuine faith.
[00:40:20.420 --> 00:40:21.500]   Again, just read one more.
[00:40:21.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   Hebrews 11, 17.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:27.620]   "By faith Abraham, when he was tested, offered up Isaac, and he who had received the promises
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:31.420]   was in the act of offering up his only son."
[00:40:31.420 --> 00:40:39.740]   Even something as incredible as offering up his son, who was supposed to be the line of
[00:40:39.740 --> 00:40:47.860]   the promise of God, he said even that he was willing to offer up because he had faith.
[00:40:47.860 --> 00:40:50.660]   Let me get to the conclusion of this.
[00:40:50.660 --> 00:40:54.620]   Because the question is, then does salvation by faith nullify the law?
[00:40:54.620 --> 00:40:55.660]   It says, "Absolutely not.
[00:40:55.660 --> 00:40:56.900]   We established the law."
[00:40:56.900 --> 00:40:59.220]   Then how does it establish the law?
[00:40:59.220 --> 00:41:03.780]   Practically speaking, right?
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:12.060]   If you've embraced justification by faith without deep contemplation, maybe you have
[00:41:12.060 --> 00:41:18.140]   at one point but you haven't recently, it automatically leads to a superficial application
[00:41:18.140 --> 00:41:19.140]   in life.
[00:41:19.140 --> 00:41:20.140]   Because we just assume.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:25.660]   You know, when you bring the gospel to the students in China, some of you guys who've
[00:41:25.660 --> 00:41:30.180]   been there with us before, you know, it takes them a long time to come to faith.
[00:41:30.180 --> 00:41:33.540]   You know, it takes them a long time.
[00:41:33.540 --> 00:41:37.620]   And as they're thinking through, they understand the consequence of what this means.
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:41.460]   So they'll question about the validity of the Bible.
[00:41:41.460 --> 00:41:43.700]   They'll question about creationism.
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:45.940]   They'll question the communist system versus capital.
[00:41:45.940 --> 00:41:48.860]   I mean, they examine where did the Bible come from?
[00:41:48.860 --> 00:41:50.380]   Do I really believe this?
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:52.180]   Was Jesus really the son of God?
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.660]   How do you compare other religions?
[00:41:53.660 --> 00:41:56.540]   And they go through all of this and sometimes it takes them years.
[00:41:56.540 --> 00:42:01.860]   And then even after they've heard all of that, they take time to say, "But do I really believe
[00:42:01.860 --> 00:42:02.860]   this?
[00:42:02.860 --> 00:42:04.220]   Do I really believe this?"
[00:42:04.220 --> 00:42:06.780]   And they wrestle over this for a long time.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:11.200]   And then when they finally make a decision, they've counted the cost.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:12.420]   And there's an immediate defect.
[00:42:12.420 --> 00:42:14.660]   And you can see it in their lives.
[00:42:14.660 --> 00:42:17.380]   Because they've examined themselves.
[00:42:17.380 --> 00:42:29.740]   So if our whole salvation hinges upon faith, shouldn't we be much more careful to examine
[00:42:29.740 --> 00:42:33.620]   that this faith is genuine?
[00:42:33.620 --> 00:42:35.420]   See the mistake we make is, "It's by faith.
[00:42:35.420 --> 00:42:36.420]   Oh, that was easy.
[00:42:36.420 --> 00:42:40.100]   If it's by faith, I heard it.
[00:42:40.100 --> 00:42:41.500]   I believe that that was easy."
[00:42:41.500 --> 00:42:50.100]   Instead, if it hinges upon this faith, and if everything is founded upon this particular
[00:42:50.100 --> 00:43:00.460]   faith, shouldn't we take careful time and examination to see, "Is this genuine?"
[00:43:00.460 --> 00:43:06.260]   If it is not about works, it's not about our pursuits, it's not about our knowledge, it's
[00:43:06.260 --> 00:43:15.380]   not about our talent, it is on faith that if it is real, has power to even move mountains.
[00:43:15.380 --> 00:43:21.580]   If the whole building is founded upon that one cornerstone, don't you want to make sure
[00:43:21.580 --> 00:43:25.300]   that that cornerstone has no cracks?
[00:43:25.300 --> 00:43:30.180]   Don't you want to make sure that that cornerstone is the perfect stone for that corner?
[00:43:30.180 --> 00:43:36.340]   Because anything you build on that is going to be like building on sand.
[00:43:36.340 --> 00:43:37.340]   It's going to crumble.
[00:43:37.340 --> 00:43:43.220]   You know, when I was in China, there's a term called "guanxi."
[00:43:43.220 --> 00:43:45.660]   Some of you guys who know Chinese know what guanxi is.
[00:43:45.660 --> 00:43:48.340]   Guanxi basically means connection or relationship.
[00:43:48.340 --> 00:43:52.220]   And in China, they say everything functions under guanxi.
[00:43:52.220 --> 00:43:56.660]   No matter how much money you have, how educated you are, you have to have connection.
[00:43:56.660 --> 00:44:01.580]   So there was a guy, an official of the school that we were at, and he was all about guanxi.
[00:44:01.580 --> 00:44:04.340]   Some of you guys know his name, Charles.
[00:44:04.340 --> 00:44:06.740]   He named himself after Charles Barkley.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:10.620]   And he was a little bit closer to my age, so whenever I was in China, I spent most of
[00:44:10.620 --> 00:44:12.420]   my time with him.
[00:44:12.420 --> 00:44:15.380]   And so everything was about guanxi, this guy.
[00:44:15.380 --> 00:44:18.460]   And when I met him, he was already educated.
[00:44:18.460 --> 00:44:20.620]   He was an English teacher, and he was kind of moving up.
[00:44:20.620 --> 00:44:23.540]   But this guy had connections with the weather bureau.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:28.180]   I mean, literally, we would sit down and say, "Oh, you know, we're having an activity next
[00:44:28.180 --> 00:44:30.180]   Tuesday, and I hope it doesn't rain."
[00:44:30.180 --> 00:44:31.540]   And he would say, "Wait a second."
[00:44:31.540 --> 00:44:34.140]   And he would punch a number, and he's just like, "Hey, you know, is it going to rain
[00:44:34.140 --> 00:44:35.140]   Tuesday?"
[00:44:35.140 --> 00:44:36.140]   And he'd say, "It's not going to rain."
[00:44:36.140 --> 00:44:37.140]   Like, "Who'd you call?"
[00:44:37.140 --> 00:44:38.140]   "Oh, it's my friend from the weather bureau."
[00:44:38.140 --> 00:44:39.140]   You know?
[00:44:39.180 --> 00:44:44.900]   And this guy had connections everywhere, because he believed that his way of advancing in life
[00:44:44.900 --> 00:44:46.940]   is guanxi.
[00:44:46.940 --> 00:44:52.060]   So he invested everything in guanxi, and so he was trying to have guanxi with me.
[00:44:52.060 --> 00:44:53.420]   He didn't know I was a pastor.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:55.740]   He didn't know, you know, he was cooking up with the wrong guy.
[00:44:55.740 --> 00:45:01.100]   But he, he, I'm from America, and I have all these young people coming, and so we have
[00:45:01.100 --> 00:45:03.860]   kept in touch, and every once in a while, he'll still email me.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:07.140]   Usually when he needs something, you know, he'll email me, and he'll say, "Hey, what's
[00:45:07.140 --> 00:45:08.140]   going on, Peter?
[00:45:08.140 --> 00:45:09.900]   Do you have access to the computer?"
[00:45:09.900 --> 00:45:11.540]   And whatever, right?
[00:45:11.540 --> 00:45:18.220]   But for his life, all of it was dedicated to guanxi, because guanxi meant everything.
[00:45:18.220 --> 00:45:19.780]   Right?
[00:45:19.780 --> 00:45:30.860]   If our whole salvation is founded upon faith, then shouldn't we be careful to examine if
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.820]   that faith is real?
[00:45:32.820 --> 00:45:37.340]   If that faith is genuine?
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.820]   If it is little?
[00:45:38.820 --> 00:45:40.260]   If it is big?
[00:45:40.260 --> 00:45:42.680]   If that faith has atrophy?
[00:45:42.680 --> 00:45:47.060]   If that faith is non-existent?
[00:45:47.060 --> 00:45:53.300]   See Paul tells this church in Corinth, there's all kinds of chaos coming in, all kinds of
[00:45:53.300 --> 00:45:57.700]   bickering, all kinds of division, immorality in the church.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:04.340]   And he says, in conclusion of the two letters that he writes, 2 Corinthians 35, "Examine
[00:46:04.340 --> 00:46:08.940]   yourself to see whether you are in the faith.
[00:46:08.940 --> 00:46:14.580]   Test yourselves, or do you not realize this about yourself, that Jesus Christ is in you,
[00:46:14.580 --> 00:46:19.220]   unless indeed you fail to meet the test."
[00:46:19.220 --> 00:46:25.180]   We receive this grace so superficially, without even questioning, we just assume, "Of course
[00:46:25.180 --> 00:46:26.940]   I have faith."
[00:46:26.940 --> 00:46:31.620]   And Paul says, "If you have faith, why does your church look like that?
[00:46:31.620 --> 00:46:32.620]   Why do you do this?
[00:46:32.620 --> 00:46:34.540]   Why is the world so important to you?"
[00:46:34.540 --> 00:46:36.820]   So Paul's not saying that, "I don't think you're a Christian."
[00:46:36.820 --> 00:46:38.180]   That's not what Paul's saying.
[00:46:38.180 --> 00:46:43.900]   Paul's causing them to say, "Take a look at what you confess.
[00:46:43.900 --> 00:46:51.620]   Take a look at what you confess to believe, and see how you're living.
[00:46:51.620 --> 00:46:58.380]   Is your confession, and your life, consistent with the things that you confess?"
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:46:59.380]   It's not about works.
[00:46:59.380 --> 00:47:04.260]   He's not saying that if you do good works, you're going to be saved.
[00:47:04.260 --> 00:47:10.300]   But if it has genuine faith, would it not change us?
[00:47:10.300 --> 00:47:18.540]   If we genuinely believe that our loved ones are headed to hell, would that not change
[00:47:18.540 --> 00:47:22.300]   us?
[00:47:22.300 --> 00:47:29.340]   Our friends, our co-workers who are sitting next to us, that we confess in this comfortable
[00:47:29.340 --> 00:47:38.580]   safe room every week about the judgment of God that's coming, and we really believe that,
[00:47:38.580 --> 00:47:41.340]   would that not change us?
[00:47:41.340 --> 00:47:49.020]   If we really believe that this world is headed toward destruction because of pride, and we
[00:47:49.020 --> 00:47:56.780]   really believe that Jesus Christ came to save us from this empty way of life, in comparison
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:48:02.860]   to the knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, wouldn't that become rubbish?
[00:48:02.860 --> 00:48:06.340]   Why is it still so attractive?
[00:48:06.340 --> 00:48:09.820]   Why are we still so numb?
[00:48:09.820 --> 00:48:16.020]   Why are we still the same before and after we believed?
[00:48:16.020 --> 00:48:20.860]   So the question is, do you not believe?
[00:48:20.860 --> 00:48:23.900]   Or have you forgotten?
[00:48:23.900 --> 00:48:27.980]   Have you forgotten the grace of Jesus Christ?
[00:48:27.980 --> 00:48:34.260]   Have you forgotten when you first heard the Gospel message and God opened your eyes, and
[00:48:34.260 --> 00:48:40.620]   when you believed for the first time, how that changed everything?
[00:48:40.620 --> 00:48:43.580]   It changed everything.
[00:48:43.580 --> 00:48:49.940]   Every suffering that you experienced, now it made sense that that's why you suffered,
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:55.380]   because we were in a broken world, that God orchestrated all of this to bring you to Him.
[00:48:55.380 --> 00:49:00.820]   That when you realized for the first time, the Son of God knows my name.
[00:49:00.820 --> 00:49:03.660]   Jesus knows my name.
[00:49:03.660 --> 00:49:07.060]   And that fact alone changed you.
[00:49:07.060 --> 00:49:10.860]   That fact alone caused you to come before His throne in tears.
[00:49:10.860 --> 00:49:13.380]   You know me.
[00:49:13.380 --> 00:49:18.220]   Why do you care about me?
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:22.540]   If you believed that, wouldn't that change us?
[00:49:22.540 --> 00:49:26.180]   Wouldn't that change the direction of our lives?
[00:49:26.180 --> 00:49:30.660]   Wouldn't that cause us to pursue Him with all our might?
[00:49:30.660 --> 00:49:35.780]   Wouldn't that cause us to have compassion for those who do not know Him?
[00:49:35.780 --> 00:49:37.780]   If we believed.
[00:49:37.780 --> 00:49:42.740]   See, justification by faith does not nullify the law.
[00:49:42.740 --> 00:49:43.740]   No.
[00:49:43.740 --> 00:49:46.380]   It established the law.
[00:49:46.380 --> 00:49:47.260]   It changes us.
