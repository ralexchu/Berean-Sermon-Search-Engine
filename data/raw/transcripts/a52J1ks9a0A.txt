[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:09.420]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:09.420 --> 00:09:12.420]   Welcome to Bering Community Church.
[00:09:12.420 --> 00:09:15.420]   Let me jump to our announcements before we get started.
[00:09:15.420 --> 00:09:19.420]   First of all, our weekday Bible study is gonna start
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:21.420]   not this Wednesday, but next Wednesday.
[00:09:21.420 --> 00:09:26.420]   And again, our kickoff for that will be this coming Friday.
[00:09:26.420 --> 00:09:29.420]   We have praise and prayer at 7.30 p.m. in this room.
[00:09:29.420 --> 00:09:33.420]   And so that'll kind of get us ready for the Bible study.
[00:09:33.420 --> 00:09:35.420]   So our Bible study, the home groups,
[00:09:35.420 --> 00:09:37.420]   and all of it is kicking back up next week.
[00:09:37.420 --> 00:09:39.420]   So just keep that in mind.
[00:09:39.420 --> 00:09:42.420]   Child safety training for volunteers.
[00:09:42.420 --> 00:09:44.420]   So if you are involved in any kind of ministry
[00:09:44.420 --> 00:09:46.420]   where you're watching children,
[00:09:46.420 --> 00:09:47.420]   even if you're just babysitting,
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:51.420]   there is a child training that is required in the church.
[00:09:51.420 --> 00:09:54.420]   It's taking place on January 29th at 1 p.m.
[00:09:54.420 --> 00:09:57.420]   So the sign up for that is gonna be on the website
[00:09:57.420 --> 00:09:59.420]   and various channels in the church.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:00.420]   So please look out for that.
[00:10:00.420 --> 00:10:03.420]   And again, that's happening in January 29th.
[00:10:03.420 --> 00:10:05.420]   And then Bible Lab.
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:07.420]   As we're kicking up the Bible study,
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:10.420]   if you are new to the church and you're not familiar with
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.420]   how to do inductive Bible study,
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   or maybe you kind of want a refresher
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:17.420]   in how to do the inductive Bible study,
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:20.420]   we have a Bible Lab that's starting on January 29th
[00:10:20.420 --> 00:10:21.420]   through February 19th.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.420]   I think it's three sessions that's taking place
[00:10:24.420 --> 00:10:27.420]   at 2 to 3 on Sunday afternoon.
[00:10:27.420 --> 00:10:30.420]   And so I highly recommend that you take that class.
[00:10:30.420 --> 00:10:32.420]   It'll help you to jump into the Bible study
[00:10:32.420 --> 00:10:35.420]   and kind of figure out how to do this inductive Bible study
[00:10:35.420 --> 00:10:38.420]   where you examine it, ask good questions,
[00:10:38.420 --> 00:10:40.420]   looking at the context.
[00:10:40.420 --> 00:10:42.420]   And so even if you've taken it,
[00:10:42.420 --> 00:10:43.420]   if you think it's gonna be helpful,
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:45.420]   we encourage you to take that class.
[00:10:45.420 --> 00:10:48.420]   And again, that's happening in January 29th.
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:50.420]   After this service at 1.30--
[00:10:50.420 --> 00:10:52.420]   okay, some of you guys may have looked at the app
[00:10:52.420 --> 00:10:56.420]   and said 2 o'clock, and that was corrected.
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:11:01.420]   At 1.30 in this room, we're gonna start our members meeting,
[00:11:01.420 --> 00:11:03.420]   which is, again, our quarterly members meeting.
[00:11:03.420 --> 00:11:05.420]   If for whatever reason you can't make it,
[00:11:05.420 --> 00:11:07.420]   please give us a heads-up on that.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:10.420]   We are recommitting to our covenant as a church,
[00:11:10.420 --> 00:11:13.420]   and so please make sure you come to that at 1.30.
[00:11:13.420 --> 00:11:16.420]   And along with that, in order for you guys--
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.420]   for us to start at 1.30, we wanted you to stay on campus.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:24.420]   So our BAM group is basically made lunch,
[00:11:24.420 --> 00:11:26.420]   a boxed turkey sandwich lunch
[00:11:26.420 --> 00:11:28.420]   that's gonna be sold for $5 at cost
[00:11:28.420 --> 00:11:30.420]   just so that you can eat here
[00:11:30.420 --> 00:11:32.420]   and then come straight into the meeting at 1.30.
[00:11:32.420 --> 00:11:34.420]   You don't have to be a member to eat that.
[00:11:34.420 --> 00:11:36.420]   You don't have to have signed up.
[00:11:36.420 --> 00:11:38.420]   If you just want to go and grab lunch there,
[00:11:38.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   make sure you do that.
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   So right after service, you'll see where you can go
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:44.420]   and grab that lunch, and you can just spread out in the church.
[00:11:44.420 --> 00:11:47.420]   And if we're not able to eat outside,
[00:11:47.420 --> 00:11:50.420]   we are okay eating in here.
[00:11:50.420 --> 00:11:53.420]   We're hoping you don't, but if you have to,
[00:11:53.420 --> 00:11:55.420]   you could use that front desk, okay?
[00:11:55.420 --> 00:11:57.420]   But if you don't have to, don't do it.
[00:11:57.420 --> 00:11:58.420]   [laughter]
[00:11:58.420 --> 00:12:01.420]   Okay, but again, we don't know what the weather's gonna be like,
[00:12:01.420 --> 00:12:03.420]   just right after service.
[00:12:03.420 --> 00:12:06.420]   And then along with that, our youth group--
[00:12:06.420 --> 00:12:09.420]   you've already probably seen as you're going into the cafe area,
[00:12:09.420 --> 00:12:13.420]   you'll see the youth group out there wanting your money.
[00:12:13.420 --> 00:12:15.420]   So they have a bake sale going on,
[00:12:15.420 --> 00:12:19.420]   and that's to raise funds for their retreat that's coming up.
[00:12:19.420 --> 00:12:21.420]   So they were here Friday night,
[00:12:21.420 --> 00:12:23.420]   and then Saturday, making the baked goods.
[00:12:23.420 --> 00:12:26.420]   And so if you go to that table, they can take Zelle or cash.
[00:12:26.420 --> 00:12:28.420]   So you can go visit that table
[00:12:28.420 --> 00:12:30.420]   and then support them by getting that.
[00:12:30.420 --> 00:12:31.420]   And along with that,
[00:12:31.420 --> 00:12:35.420]   they are also selling the Borean sweatshirt.
[00:12:35.420 --> 00:12:39.420]   I don't have a sample to show you, but I heard it was awesome.
[00:12:39.420 --> 00:12:41.420]   It's coveted, and we have limited supply,
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:44.420]   so I'm gonna go there as soon as possible to get that.
[00:12:44.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   So that is also going to help them with their summer retreat,
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:50.420]   so please visit that table to help them out.
[00:12:50.420 --> 00:12:54.420]   All right, so after our offering time,
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:57.420]   our brother Josh Yunui is gonna come up and give his testimony,
[00:12:57.420 --> 00:12:59.420]   and we'll be baptized this morning.
[00:12:59.420 --> 00:13:02.420]   For those of you who brought physical offering,
[00:13:02.420 --> 00:13:05.420]   there is an offering basket over there by that door as you're exiting.
[00:13:05.420 --> 00:13:11.420]   All right, let's pray.
[00:13:11.420 --> 00:13:13.420]   Gracious Father, we thank you so much
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:17.420]   for your continued grace and love over our lives.
[00:13:17.420 --> 00:13:19.420]   The things that we are aware of,
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:21.420]   things that we are not aware of,
[00:13:21.420 --> 00:13:24.420]   that you're orchestrating behind the scene,
[00:13:24.420 --> 00:13:28.420]   help us, Lord God, to have faith, confidence.
[00:13:28.420 --> 00:13:31.420]   Lord, that our profession would not be empty words,
[00:13:31.420 --> 00:13:33.420]   but our very hearts, our lives, Lord God,
[00:13:33.420 --> 00:13:36.420]   would reflect the songs that we sing,
[00:13:36.420 --> 00:13:38.420]   the doctrines that we confess.
[00:13:38.420 --> 00:13:40.420]   We pray that your name may be honored,
[00:13:40.420 --> 00:13:44.420]   that even in this giving may it be an act of worship to you,
[00:13:44.420 --> 00:13:48.420]   and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for your kingdom.
[00:13:48.420 --> 00:13:51.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:14:56.420 --> 00:14:59.420]   Church family, let's all rise together.
[00:14:59.420 --> 00:15:01.420]   What a joy and privilege it is to gather
[00:15:01.420 --> 00:15:03.420]   at the corporate body of Christ.
[00:15:03.420 --> 00:15:06.420]   Let's clap and sing for He's worthy.

[00:15:55.420 --> 00:15:57.420]   Blessed be your name.

[00:16:19.420 --> 00:16:23.420]   I'll turn back to pray.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:27.420]   When the darkness closes in, Lord,
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:30.420]   still I will say,
[00:16:30.420 --> 00:16:34.420]   blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:16:34.420 --> 00:16:38.420]   Blessed be your name.

[00:17:03.420 --> 00:17:07.420]   The sun shining down on me.
[00:17:07.420 --> 00:17:11.420]   The world's all as it should be.
[00:17:11.420 --> 00:17:13.420]   Blessed be your name.
[00:17:13.420 --> 00:17:16.420]   [piano music]
[00:17:16.420 --> 00:17:19.420]   Blessed be your name.
[00:17:19.420 --> 00:17:23.420]   On the road marked with suffering,
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:27.420]   the pain in the offering.
[00:17:27.420 --> 00:17:29.420]   Blessed be your name.
[00:17:29.420 --> 00:17:30.420]   Every blessing.
[00:17:30.420 --> 00:17:32.420]   [piano music]
[00:17:32.420 --> 00:17:35.420]   Every blessing you pour out,
[00:17:35.420 --> 00:17:39.420]   I'll turn back to pray.
[00:17:39.420 --> 00:17:43.420]   When the darkness closes in, Lord,
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:46.420]   still I will say,
[00:17:46.420 --> 00:17:50.420]   blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.420]   Blessed be your name, yes, Lord.
[00:17:54.420 --> 00:17:58.420]   Blessed be the name of the Lord.
[00:17:58.420 --> 00:18:02.420]   Blessed be your glorious name.
[00:18:02.420 --> 00:18:03.420]   Yeah.
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.420]   [piano music]

[00:18:18.420 --> 00:18:20.420]   One more time, again.

[00:23:15.420 --> 00:23:23.420]   - All my life, I went to church.
[00:23:23.420 --> 00:23:26.420]   I had faithful parents who always tried to point me to God,
[00:23:26.420 --> 00:23:29.420]   and I believe I was a pretty good person growing up.
[00:23:29.420 --> 00:23:31.420]   But that's the problem.
[00:23:31.420 --> 00:23:34.420]   I was a regular churchgoer without seeing my need for Christ
[00:23:34.420 --> 00:23:37.420]   as a wretched sinner that had no true good inside.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.420]   When I was younger, I remember thinking that certain sins
[00:23:40.420 --> 00:23:43.420]   and sermons were relevant to me.
[00:23:43.420 --> 00:23:45.420]   In fact, I would completely zone out the pastor
[00:23:45.420 --> 00:23:47.420]   and pinpoint the people who I thought really needed
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:49.420]   to pay attention as I sat there judging
[00:23:49.420 --> 00:23:51.420]   and comparing my life to theirs.
[00:23:51.420 --> 00:23:54.420]   I would try to convince and justify that I'm a better Christian
[00:23:54.420 --> 00:23:57.420]   than others, making me so blind to my own sin
[00:23:57.420 --> 00:23:59.420]   and twisted views of faith,
[00:23:59.420 --> 00:24:01.420]   deeming it permissible to be this way.
[00:24:01.420 --> 00:24:05.420]   I didn't see how prideful, judgmental, greedy,
[00:24:05.420 --> 00:24:08.420]   disobedient, selfish, impure, envious,
[00:24:08.420 --> 00:24:10.420]   and wicked of a person I was.
[00:24:10.420 --> 00:24:13.420]   The worst of it all is that I thought this whole time
[00:24:13.420 --> 00:24:16.420]   I was saved, and that was the furthest thing from the truth.
[00:24:16.420 --> 00:24:19.420]   It was apparent that I had no real understanding
[00:24:19.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   of the gravity of my sin, no idea how wrong it was
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:24.420]   for Jesus to die on the cross in my place,
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.420]   and no comprehension of how undeserving I am
[00:24:26.420 --> 00:24:29.420]   of God's grace and mercy.
[00:24:29.420 --> 00:24:31.420]   Things began to change for me in middle school,
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:34.420]   as a lot was going on circumstantially.
[00:24:34.420 --> 00:24:37.420]   I was going to my third different school in three years,
[00:24:37.420 --> 00:24:41.420]   and with that came a lot of social anxiety and weariness,
[00:24:41.420 --> 00:24:44.420]   as I had to make new friends, lose old ones,
[00:24:44.420 --> 00:24:47.420]   and adapt to my surroundings again and again.
[00:24:47.420 --> 00:24:50.420]   I felt like nobody understood what I was going through,
[00:24:50.420 --> 00:24:53.420]   making me feel isolated and alone.
[00:24:53.420 --> 00:24:56.420]   But that's when God intervened.
[00:24:56.420 --> 00:25:04.420]   [silence]
[00:25:04.420 --> 00:25:07.420]   Amidst all this...
[00:25:07.420 --> 00:25:10.420]   [silence]
[00:25:10.420 --> 00:25:13.420]   Sorry.
[00:25:13.420 --> 00:25:16.420]   I felt the nearness and comfort of the Lord.
[00:25:16.420 --> 00:25:19.420]   [silence]
[00:25:19.420 --> 00:25:21.420]   God opened my eyes to see Him
[00:25:21.420 --> 00:25:24.420]   as the orchestrator of these events in my life,
[00:25:24.420 --> 00:25:27.420]   and to trust in His plan.
[00:25:27.420 --> 00:25:31.420]   I felt so undeserving of God's love,
[00:25:31.420 --> 00:25:34.420]   as the reality of the gospel hit home.
[00:25:34.420 --> 00:25:36.420]   [silence]
[00:25:36.420 --> 00:25:38.420]   That Jesus, the perfect Son of Man,
[00:25:38.420 --> 00:25:40.420]   died in my place on the cross,
[00:25:40.420 --> 00:25:42.420]   in love and obedience,
[00:25:42.420 --> 00:25:44.420]   so I can be reconciled with God,
[00:25:44.420 --> 00:25:47.420]   in Christ's victory over sin and death.
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.420]   It was the first time I saw my sin,
[00:25:50.420 --> 00:25:53.420]   for what it truly is.
[00:25:53.420 --> 00:25:56.420]   The debt I couldn't pay that only Jesus could.
[00:25:56.420 --> 00:25:59.420]   I remember breaking down in tears,
[00:25:59.420 --> 00:26:01.420]   as I couldn't help but think,
[00:26:01.420 --> 00:26:04.420]   why would God, Creator of the universe,
[00:26:04.420 --> 00:26:08.420]   sacrifice His Son for a sinner like me?
[00:26:08.420 --> 00:26:15.420]   [silence]
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:17.420]   I was destined for hell,
[00:26:17.420 --> 00:26:21.420]   but God spared me with grace and compassion.
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   I was supposed to be His enemy,
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:27.420]   yet He called me His own.
[00:26:27.420 --> 00:26:30.420]   [silence]
[00:26:30.420 --> 00:26:32.420]   I no longer wanted to be a sinner,
[00:26:32.420 --> 00:26:34.420]   without remorse, but a redeemed soul
[00:26:34.420 --> 00:26:37.420]   with a heart of repentance.
[00:26:37.420 --> 00:26:40.420]   Fast-forwarding to my junior year of college,
[00:26:40.420 --> 00:26:44.420]   I faced a humbling trial that tested my faith.
[00:26:44.420 --> 00:26:47.420]   My walk with God took a turn,
[00:26:47.420 --> 00:26:50.420]   when a relationship I cared about so deeply fell apart.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.420]   It felt like my world flipped upside down,
[00:26:53.420 --> 00:26:56.420]   and I did not know what to do.
[00:26:56.420 --> 00:26:59.420]   I turned away from the Lord and stopped going to church.
[00:26:59.420 --> 00:27:03.420]   In an effort to numb myself to the pain I was feeling,
[00:27:03.420 --> 00:27:07.420]   I turned to alcohol, smoking, and the pleasures of the world.
[00:27:07.420 --> 00:27:12.420]   I desired temporary fulfillment as a means to satisfy my flesh,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:15.420]   while my soul was left to dry.
[00:27:15.420 --> 00:27:18.420]   I again had no remorse for sin,
[00:27:18.420 --> 00:27:21.420]   and would not care that I was offending God,
[00:27:21.420 --> 00:27:23.420]   as I sought to fill this void within.
[00:27:23.420 --> 00:27:26.420]   I was hopeless, empty, and lost.
[00:27:26.420 --> 00:27:30.420]   This path of destruction bled into this year of my senior year of college,
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:33.420]   as I had no desire to redirect my course.
[00:27:33.420 --> 00:27:36.420]   [sniffles]
[00:27:36.420 --> 00:27:40.420]   Yet again, God, full of grace and mercy, stepped in.
[00:27:40.420 --> 00:27:43.420]   [sighs]
[00:27:43.420 --> 00:27:47.420]   This past summer, God drew me to Berean.
[00:27:47.420 --> 00:27:51.420]   I had no interest in coming to church again,
[00:27:51.420 --> 00:27:54.420]   as I thought I was too far from the Lord,
[00:27:54.420 --> 00:27:57.420]   coupled with the guilt and shame I felt inside
[00:27:57.420 --> 00:28:00.420]   over the life I had been living.
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:02.420]   [sighs]
[00:28:02.420 --> 00:28:05.420]   When I look back on this time,
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:09.420]   I cannot explain why I walked through these sanctuary doors.
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:12.420]   It really is the work of the Holy Spirit
[00:28:12.420 --> 00:28:17.420]   that drew me, as I had nothing inside that wanted God.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:20.420]   I was reminded of Jesus' redemptive work on the cross
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.420]   and his victory over my sin.
[00:28:23.420 --> 00:28:26.420]   There is no soul out of his reach or beyond saving.
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:29.420]   I was filled with repentance and gratitude,
[00:28:29.420 --> 00:28:32.420]   as I remember the God who saved me years ago,
[00:28:32.420 --> 00:28:36.420]   and how he has remained faithful to me, even when I was unfaithful to him.
[00:28:36.420 --> 00:28:40.420]   It baffles me that God would pull me out of my pit of depravity,
[00:28:40.420 --> 00:28:44.420]   when all I have to offer him are my sins, failures, and shortcomings.
[00:28:44.420 --> 00:28:48.420]   This past year made me think of Luke 15, 11-32,
[00:28:48.420 --> 00:28:51.420]   which is the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:28:51.420 --> 00:28:54.420]   I felt like the reckless, wasteful young son
[00:28:54.420 --> 00:28:57.420]   coming back to his gracious and loving father.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.420]   Instead of God pouring out his wrath upon me
[00:29:00.420 --> 00:29:03.420]   and leaving me to suffer my sin and worldly sorrow,
[00:29:03.420 --> 00:29:07.420]   he had compassion on me and longed for me to walk beside him once again.
[00:29:07.420 --> 00:29:10.420]   I was deeply humbled through this trial,
[00:29:10.420 --> 00:29:13.420]   and I took for granted how good the Lord has been to me.
[00:29:13.420 --> 00:29:17.420]   Rather than trusting in him and being grateful for the way he has sustained me,
[00:29:17.420 --> 00:29:22.420]   I idolized and fixed my gaze on other people and the things of this world.
[00:29:22.420 --> 00:29:25.420]   Instead of turning to him when I had no direction,
[00:29:25.420 --> 00:29:28.420]   I relied on my own ability and strength
[00:29:28.420 --> 00:29:31.420]   to get me through my circumstances.
[00:29:31.420 --> 00:29:36.420]   God had to break me for me to realize that all I need is him.
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.420]   Even when I felt so distant,
[00:29:39.420 --> 00:29:43.420]   God was always right there holding me in the palm of his hands.
[00:29:43.420 --> 00:29:45.420]   Ephesians 2, 4-5 says,
[00:29:45.420 --> 00:29:49.420]   "God, being rich in mercy, because of his great love with which he loved us,
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:51.420]   even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:29:51.420 --> 00:29:53.420]   made us alive together with Christ.
[00:29:53.420 --> 00:29:55.420]   By grace you have been saved."
[00:29:55.420 --> 00:29:57.420]   Colossians 3, 1-3 says,
[00:29:57.420 --> 00:29:59.420]   "Therefore, if you have been raised with Christ,
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:02.420]   keep seeking the things that are above, where Christ is,
[00:30:02.420 --> 00:30:04.420]   seated at the right hand of God.
[00:30:04.420 --> 00:30:07.420]   Set your minds on the things that are above,
[00:30:07.420 --> 00:30:09.420]   not on the things that are on earth,
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:12.420]   for you have died and your life is hidden with Christ and God."
[00:30:12.420 --> 00:30:15.420]   Praise the Lord for the work he has done in my life
[00:30:15.420 --> 00:30:18.420]   and the grace he has given to me.
[00:30:18.420 --> 00:30:22.420]   I thank God for who he is and all his holiness and majesty
[00:30:22.420 --> 00:30:26.420]   and how he has opened my eyes to the truth of the gospel.
[00:30:26.420 --> 00:30:30.420]   A life without Christ is a life not worth living.
[00:30:30.420 --> 00:30:33.420]   There is no other name than Jesus.
[00:30:33.420 --> 00:30:36.420]   Thank you for listening to my testimony.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:47.420]   [applause]
[00:30:47.420 --> 00:31:00.420]   You understand when you're going into the water,
[00:31:00.420 --> 00:31:02.420]   you're being united with Christ's death.
[00:31:02.420 --> 00:31:03.420]   And when you come out,
[00:31:03.420 --> 00:31:05.420]   you're being united to his resurrected life.
[00:31:05.420 --> 00:31:07.420]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:31:07.420 --> 00:31:10.420]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:31:10.420 --> 00:31:16.420]   [applause]
[00:31:16.420 --> 00:31:27.420]   All right, Josh, thank you for that great testimony.
[00:31:27.420 --> 00:31:30.420]   And then I guess the college mob can go now.
[00:31:30.420 --> 00:31:33.420]   [laughter]
[00:31:33.420 --> 00:31:38.420]   All right, if you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:31:38.420 --> 00:31:41.420]   to Colossians 4, verses 2-4.
[00:31:41.420 --> 00:31:47.420]   We're going to give our final message on this topic.
[00:31:47.420 --> 00:31:52.420]   James 4, verses 2-4.
[00:31:57.420 --> 00:31:59.420]   "Devote yourselves to prayer,
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:02.420]   keeping alert in it with an attitude of thanksgiving,
[00:32:02.420 --> 00:32:04.420]   praying at the same time for us as well
[00:32:04.420 --> 00:32:07.420]   that God will open up to us a door for the Word
[00:32:07.420 --> 00:32:10.420]   so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:13.420]   for which I have also been imprisoned,
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:16.420]   that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak."
[00:32:16.420 --> 00:32:19.420]   Let's pray.
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:24.420]   Heavenly Father, we pray that your Holy Spirit would guide us,
[00:32:24.420 --> 00:32:28.420]   that your Word, your Word only, would go forth.
[00:32:28.420 --> 00:32:31.420]   Lord, we desire to meet with you.
[00:32:31.420 --> 00:32:35.420]   We desire to worship you and to listen to you.
[00:32:35.420 --> 00:32:38.420]   So protect this pulpit,
[00:32:38.420 --> 00:32:41.420]   protect the words that are coming out of my mouth.
[00:32:41.420 --> 00:32:43.420]   May it be anointed with your Holy Spirit.
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:46.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:32:46.420 --> 00:32:50.420]   Oftentimes, and I'm sure you may have said it,
[00:32:50.420 --> 00:32:52.420]   and I've said it often,
[00:32:52.420 --> 00:32:55.420]   that when we think about revival,
[00:32:55.420 --> 00:32:58.420]   we need to be more like the early church.
[00:32:58.420 --> 00:33:00.420]   We read the book of Acts and say,
[00:33:00.420 --> 00:33:02.420]   "We need to be like the early church."
[00:33:02.420 --> 00:33:05.420]   But when you study the New Testament,
[00:33:05.420 --> 00:33:09.420]   you find that every problem that you see in today's church,
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:12.420]   you see also in the early church.
[00:33:12.420 --> 00:33:14.420]   There's divisions, there's chaos,
[00:33:14.420 --> 00:33:18.420]   there's false teachings, lack of unity.
[00:33:18.420 --> 00:33:22.420]   Every problem that you can think of exists in the early church.
[00:33:22.420 --> 00:33:25.420]   In fact, the whole book of James is written
[00:33:25.420 --> 00:33:29.420]   because there was division and infighting within the church.
[00:33:29.420 --> 00:33:32.420]   And there was this sharp division where before,
[00:33:32.420 --> 00:33:34.420]   the rich people would hang out with the rich people
[00:33:34.420 --> 00:33:36.420]   and poor people would hang out with poor people.
[00:33:36.420 --> 00:33:39.420]   And so you can see how uncomfortable it would be
[00:33:39.420 --> 00:33:43.420]   if you are a slave owner and you're a slave,
[00:33:43.420 --> 00:33:45.420]   and there happened to be in this, a former slave,
[00:33:45.420 --> 00:33:48.420]   it happens to be in the same church.
[00:33:48.420 --> 00:33:51.420]   And yeah, they caused a lot of problems in the early church,
[00:33:51.420 --> 00:33:55.420]   and so there was a lot of divisions and concerns.
[00:33:55.420 --> 00:33:59.420]   Well, James writes to address this issue.
[00:33:59.420 --> 00:34:01.420]   When we think of the book of James,
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:04.420]   we think of faith without deeds is dead, which is true,
[00:34:04.420 --> 00:34:06.420]   but the specific thing that he was addressing
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:09.420]   was the division in the church between the rich and the poor.
[00:34:09.420 --> 00:34:11.420]   So you'll notice that if you study the book of James,
[00:34:11.420 --> 00:34:13.420]   that that's peppered throughout all of scripture.
[00:34:13.420 --> 00:34:17.420]   In fact, James says this, and this is how he describes the problem,
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.420]   James chapter 4, 2-4,
[00:34:19.420 --> 00:34:22.420]   "You lust and do not have, so you commit murder.
[00:34:22.420 --> 00:34:27.420]   You are envious and cannot obtain, so you fight and you quarrel."
[00:34:27.420 --> 00:34:30.420]   I mean, that doesn't sound like an ideal church.
[00:34:30.420 --> 00:34:33.420]   Now, he says there's divisions, there's envy,
[00:34:33.420 --> 00:34:37.420]   there's fighting, quarreling, and then he says you commit murder.
[00:34:37.420 --> 00:34:40.420]   Now, I'm not sure if he's talking about literal murder
[00:34:40.420 --> 00:34:43.420]   or he's referring to metaphorically when Jesus says
[00:34:43.420 --> 00:34:45.420]   that if you hate your brother, you're committing murder.
[00:34:45.420 --> 00:34:48.420]   We don't know, but the fact that he describes and says
[00:34:48.420 --> 00:34:52.420]   that you commit murder, you have lust in your heart, you have envy,
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:56.420]   and he says the reason why these problems exist in your church,
[00:34:56.420 --> 00:35:00.420]   he says, "Because you do not have because you do not ask."
[00:35:00.420 --> 00:35:03.420]   And then secondly, "You ask and do not receive
[00:35:03.420 --> 00:35:05.420]   because you ask with wrong motives,
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:08.420]   so that you may spend it on your pleasures."
[00:35:08.420 --> 00:35:11.420]   In other words, he says all kinds of problems
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:15.420]   entered into the church because you're not praying.
[00:35:15.420 --> 00:35:18.420]   And if you are praying, you're not praying effectively.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:21.420]   So he pinpoints in the book of James, he said,
[00:35:21.420 --> 00:35:26.420]   "It is the lack of prayer that has caused all this problem in your church."
[00:35:26.420 --> 00:35:29.420]   You're not asking. You want it from the world,
[00:35:29.420 --> 00:35:31.420]   you want it from each other, you want it from hard work,
[00:35:31.420 --> 00:35:32.420]   but you're not asking.
[00:35:32.420 --> 00:35:34.420]   And then even when you are asking,
[00:35:34.420 --> 00:35:37.420]   you're treating God as some sort of a genie,
[00:35:37.420 --> 00:35:40.420]   that here's my wish list, and then God, you know,
[00:35:40.420 --> 00:35:41.420]   would you bless me and give me that?
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:43.420]   And then when it doesn't happen, you get frustrated,
[00:35:43.420 --> 00:35:47.420]   and then basically you have a room filled with frustrated people.
[00:35:47.420 --> 00:35:52.420]   There's division, there's envy, there's coveting, there's slander,
[00:35:52.420 --> 00:35:54.420]   all kinds of things that come into the church.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:57.420]   And that's why you ever notice that if you've ever traveled,
[00:35:57.420 --> 00:35:59.420]   that if you go to the large cities,
[00:35:59.420 --> 00:36:02.420]   they tend to be more groggy and cranky,
[00:36:02.420 --> 00:36:04.420]   and they're not as friendly.
[00:36:04.420 --> 00:36:07.420]   Then if you go to parts of the world where it's kind of rural,
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:10.420]   they just naturally tend to be more friendly and hospitable.
[00:36:10.420 --> 00:36:13.420]   And I think the answer is pretty clear.
[00:36:13.420 --> 00:36:16.420]   If you're around a lot of people all the time,
[00:36:16.420 --> 00:36:19.420]   you receive crankiness.
[00:36:19.420 --> 00:36:21.420]   So as the church gets bigger,
[00:36:21.420 --> 00:36:26.420]   and if the church is filled with people who are frustrated,
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:29.420]   relationships are going to be more difficult.
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:30.420]   You're surrounded by cranky people.
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:33.420]   That's why people at DMV are so miserable.
[00:36:33.420 --> 00:36:34.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:34.420 --> 00:36:37.420]   And I'm pretty sure if you have a job
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:41.420]   where you are doing customer care constantly,
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:44.420]   that you're probably cranky at the end of the day, right?
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:46.420]   And you want to find another job.
[00:36:46.420 --> 00:36:50.420]   So if you are surrounded by people who are frustrated,
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:51.420]   that's what it leads to.
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.420]   And he says that's what happened in the church.
[00:36:53.420 --> 00:36:57.420]   The reason why there's division and envy and slander and even murder
[00:36:57.420 --> 00:37:00.420]   is because you're not praying.
[00:37:00.420 --> 00:37:03.420]   And when you are praying, you're praying ineffectively.
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:06.420]   See, when he told us to pray, he didn't just say,
[00:37:06.420 --> 00:37:09.420]   "Hey, make a list of things that you want."
[00:37:09.420 --> 00:37:12.420]   "I want to get married, and here's the qualities of a guy that I want."
[00:37:12.420 --> 00:37:14.420]   And you make this wish list.
[00:37:14.420 --> 00:37:16.420]   He needs to have a certain kind of eye, certain skin,
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   certain height, certain job.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:20.420]   And then you pray.
[00:37:20.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   You put it in this prayer incubator,
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:24.420]   and God's going to answer your prayer.
[00:37:24.420 --> 00:37:25.420]   What kind of job do you want?
[00:37:25.420 --> 00:37:27.420]   Put it on the list.
[00:37:27.420 --> 00:37:30.420]   We don't believe in the health and wealth gospel.
[00:37:30.420 --> 00:37:32.420]   It's heresy.
[00:37:32.420 --> 00:37:37.420]   And yet, if we're not careful, the way we practice prayer
[00:37:37.420 --> 00:37:40.420]   is no different than the health and wealth gospel.
[00:37:40.420 --> 00:37:41.420]   Because the health and wealth gospel,
[00:37:41.420 --> 00:37:44.420]   the only difference is that they come out and say it,
[00:37:44.420 --> 00:37:46.420]   that God is going to do this.
[00:37:46.420 --> 00:37:49.420]   If we believe him, he's going to bless us, so we do it.
[00:37:49.420 --> 00:37:52.420]   We're savvy enough, and we know the Bible well enough,
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:54.420]   to know that that's not what the Bible teaches.
[00:37:54.420 --> 00:37:59.420]   And yet, the way we practice our faith is no different,
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.420]   that what we desire from God is a bunch of wish lists
[00:38:03.420 --> 00:38:04.420]   of what we want.
[00:38:04.420 --> 00:38:07.420]   And he says the frustration, division in the church
[00:38:07.420 --> 00:38:08.420]   is happening because of that.
[00:38:08.420 --> 00:38:10.420]   We need to pray.
[00:38:10.420 --> 00:38:15.420]   And so when Paul tells them to be devoted to prayer,
[00:38:15.420 --> 00:38:19.420]   and then in today's section, starting from verse 3 and 4,
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:22.420]   he says, "Be devoted," and he gives them specific prayer requests.
[00:38:22.420 --> 00:38:27.420]   One is to pray that the door will be opened for the Word of God,
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.420]   for open doors.
[00:38:29.420 --> 00:38:32.420]   Like I said, the praying is not just making a list.
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:35.420]   The primary thing that we are called to pray for
[00:38:35.420 --> 00:38:39.420]   is to pray according to his will.
[00:38:39.420 --> 00:38:40.420]   He didn't just say, "Pray whatever you want."
[00:38:40.420 --> 00:38:44.420]   In John 15:7, he says, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:46.420]   Ask whatever you wish, and it shall be done for you."
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:50.420]   So there was a condition to answer prayer.
[00:38:50.420 --> 00:38:53.420]   There's a condition to answer prayer,
[00:38:53.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   that we have to pray according to his will.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:39:04.420]   And the Bible lays out for us so clearly what his will is.
[00:39:04.420 --> 00:39:07.420]   We often seek his will in, "Do I get this job?
[00:39:07.420 --> 00:39:08.420]   Should I go into this career?
[00:39:08.420 --> 00:39:10.420]   Should I marry this person?
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.420]   What should I do with my children?
[00:39:11.420 --> 00:39:13.420]   Where should we live?"
[00:39:13.420 --> 00:39:15.420]   And so we want to know the will of God.
[00:39:15.420 --> 00:39:17.420]   But that's not spelled out in the Bible.
[00:39:17.420 --> 00:39:20.420]   The Bible never says, "You need to be this, or you need to be that."
[00:39:20.420 --> 00:39:23.420]   But what is clearly spelled out
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:27.420]   is what he desires for mankind.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:29.420]   If we're not careful,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:32.420]   a deep study of the Word of God
[00:39:32.420 --> 00:39:35.420]   can cause us to understand the mind of God
[00:39:35.420 --> 00:39:38.420]   without knowing the heart of God.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.420]   You cannot know God until you understand the mind and the heart.
[00:39:43.420 --> 00:39:46.420]   That was exactly the problem with the Pharisees.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:50.420]   The Pharisees understood the letter of the law.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:52.420]   They studied the book of Leviticus,
[00:39:52.420 --> 00:39:55.420]   and they wanted to make sure that they kept the Sabbath holy,
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.420]   and they wanted to be perfect in abiding by the law.
[00:39:59.420 --> 00:40:01.420]   And that's exactly how Paul describes himself.
[00:40:01.420 --> 00:40:03.420]   When it comes to the law, he said he was perfect.
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:04.420]   Every Jew would have said that.
[00:40:04.420 --> 00:40:06.420]   Not Jew, every Pharisee would have said that
[00:40:06.420 --> 00:40:08.420]   because that was their source of pride.
[00:40:08.420 --> 00:40:13.420]   And yet, in Luke chapter 15,
[00:40:13.420 --> 00:40:19.420]   as Jesus is hanging around the tax collectors and the sinners, it says in verse 1,
[00:40:19.420 --> 00:40:22.420]   they're coming to listen to him, and he's engaging them.
[00:40:22.420 --> 00:40:24.420]   But in verse 2, he said,
[00:40:24.420 --> 00:40:27.420]   "Both the Pharisees and the scribes began to grumble, saying,
[00:40:27.420 --> 00:40:30.420]   'The man receives sinners and eats with them.'"
[00:40:30.420 --> 00:40:33.420]   Before we harp on the Pharisees,
[00:40:33.420 --> 00:40:35.420]   think of it from their point of view.
[00:40:35.420 --> 00:40:37.420]   The Pharisees are trying to keep the law.
[00:40:37.420 --> 00:40:39.420]   And the reason why they're trying to keep the law
[00:40:39.420 --> 00:40:42.420]   is because they went into captivity because they didn't keep the law.
[00:40:42.420 --> 00:40:45.420]   God said, "You didn't practice Sabbath."
[00:40:45.420 --> 00:40:48.420]   So he said, "Because of all the years that you've ignored my Sabbath,
[00:40:48.420 --> 00:40:51.420]   I'm going to take you into captivity for 70 years,
[00:40:51.420 --> 00:40:53.420]   for every year that you didn't obey,
[00:40:53.420 --> 00:40:55.420]   we're going to give the land rest."
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.420]   So when they broke out of that,
[00:40:57.420 --> 00:41:01.420]   the Pharisees were created so that they can keep the law.
[00:41:01.420 --> 00:41:04.420]   And that's why they said, "You're hanging around with sinners,"
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:08.420]   and they were trying so hard to be clean.
[00:41:08.420 --> 00:41:12.420]   They're trying so hard to keep the letter of the law,
[00:41:12.420 --> 00:41:15.420]   what was taught in the book of Leviticus.
[00:41:15.420 --> 00:41:18.420]   And yet, they completely missed God.
[00:41:18.420 --> 00:41:22.420]   So if you notice, the Pharisees come to rebuke Jesus
[00:41:22.420 --> 00:41:25.420]   for not only him being unclean,
[00:41:25.420 --> 00:41:28.420]   but you're dragging everybody else with you to be unclean.
[00:41:28.420 --> 00:41:32.420]   And if you keep doing that, then we're going to lose the blessing of God.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:34.420]   So you remember, in Luke chapter 15,
[00:41:34.420 --> 00:41:36.420]   Jesus turns the table around,
[00:41:36.420 --> 00:41:39.420]   saying, "You don't know the Father."
[00:41:39.420 --> 00:41:41.420]   And he gives three parables.
[00:41:41.420 --> 00:41:43.420]   The first parable is the lost sheep,
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:45.420]   the 99 sheep versus the one.
[00:41:45.420 --> 00:41:49.420]   He says he leaves them behind because that one sheep is so precious to God
[00:41:49.420 --> 00:41:51.420]   that he would go and get him and come back,
[00:41:51.420 --> 00:41:53.420]   and it ends in celebration.
[00:41:53.420 --> 00:41:55.420]   So he's not saying the 99 are important.
[00:41:55.420 --> 00:41:59.420]   He's saying every single one of these sheep are important to God.
[00:41:59.420 --> 00:42:02.420]   The second parable is just like the first parable,
[00:42:02.420 --> 00:42:04.420]   the lost coin.
[00:42:04.420 --> 00:42:06.420]   And the owner goes and sweeps the house,
[00:42:06.420 --> 00:42:10.420]   and when he finally finds the coin, they throw a big celebration.
[00:42:10.420 --> 00:42:13.420]   And then the third and the final and the main point that he was trying to get
[00:42:13.420 --> 00:42:18.420]   is the prodigal son, which Josh mentioned this morning.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:21.420]   The prodigal son, in rebellion, wants his inheritance.
[00:42:21.420 --> 00:42:24.420]   He disappears, and when he hits the pits, he comes back,
[00:42:24.420 --> 00:42:26.420]   and the father, instead of rebuking him,
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:30.420]   embraces him and reestablishes him,
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.420]   and then has a huge celebration.
[00:42:33.420 --> 00:42:37.420]   And then he turns around to the older brother who's complaining.
[00:42:37.420 --> 00:42:41.420]   "I did all the things right, but you never celebrated for me."
[00:42:41.420 --> 00:42:43.420]   And yet this guy goes in rebellion, he comes back,
[00:42:43.420 --> 00:42:45.420]   "You're celebrating for him."
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.420]   The point of the story, all three of them,
[00:42:47.420 --> 00:42:51.420]   started because the Pharisees pointed at Jesus and saying,
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:56.420]   "You're hanging out with sinners, and you're making not only us unclean,
[00:42:56.420 --> 00:42:58.420]   you're making our country unclean."
[00:42:58.420 --> 00:43:01.420]   The point that Jesus was trying to make is,
[00:43:01.420 --> 00:43:05.420]   "You know the law, but you don't know God."
[00:43:05.420 --> 00:43:07.420]   "You know the law, but you don't know God."
[00:43:07.420 --> 00:43:10.420]   "You're trying to keep the law perfectly,
[00:43:10.420 --> 00:43:14.420]   but you don't understand the purpose of the law."
[00:43:14.420 --> 00:43:18.420]   "You understand the Bible, but you don't know the purpose of the Bible."
[00:43:18.420 --> 00:43:22.420]   "If we don't understand the heart of God,
[00:43:22.420 --> 00:43:25.420]   you end up dissecting the Bible, doing inductive Bible study,
[00:43:25.420 --> 00:43:28.420]   and getting theology right, but you completely missed the whole point."
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:32.420]   This whole reason why Leviticus and Sabbath and all of that was established
[00:43:32.420 --> 00:43:36.420]   was to prepare them for what Jesus came to do.
[00:43:36.420 --> 00:43:38.420]   Jesus says in Luke chapter 19, 10,
[00:43:38.420 --> 00:43:42.420]   "For the Son of Man has come to seek and save that which was lost."
[00:43:42.420 --> 00:43:45.420]   That was the summary of why he came.
[00:43:45.420 --> 00:43:49.420]   To seek and save the lost.
[00:43:49.420 --> 00:43:53.420]   Not to simply show them an example of what a man looks like
[00:43:53.420 --> 00:43:55.420]   when he perfectly obeys the law.
[00:43:55.420 --> 00:43:58.420]   He says the primary reason, the main reason,
[00:43:58.420 --> 00:44:00.420]   why all the law was given
[00:44:00.420 --> 00:44:03.420]   was so that it would prepare you for my coming.
[00:44:03.420 --> 00:44:05.420]   To seek and save the lost.
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.420]   In fact, Paul himself says, 1 Corinthians 3, 9,
[00:44:07.420 --> 00:44:11.420]   "For we are God's fellow workers, you are God's field, God's building."
[00:44:11.420 --> 00:44:13.420]   This is God's heart.
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:16.420]   This is why we do everything that we do.
[00:44:16.420 --> 00:44:20.420]   And he says we are simply joining his work.
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:22.420]   We're not just observants. We don't just watch him.
[00:44:22.420 --> 00:44:24.420]   We don't just celebrate him saving.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.420]   He says, now that we are saved,
[00:44:26.420 --> 00:44:31.420]   we are to be his co-laborers for the same purpose.
[00:44:31.420 --> 00:44:33.420]   And then in 2 Corinthians 5, 20, Paul says,
[00:44:33.420 --> 00:44:36.420]   "Therefore, we are ambassadors for Christ,
[00:44:36.420 --> 00:44:39.420]   as though God were making an appeal through us."
[00:44:39.420 --> 00:44:42.420]   We beg you on behalf of Christ, be reconciled to God.
[00:44:42.420 --> 00:44:45.420]   What Christ came to do.
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:47.420]   Everything that God's been doing,
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:51.420]   now that we are saved, we are called to do the same.
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:53.420]   To join him.
[00:44:53.420 --> 00:44:57.420]   To plead with the fallen world to be reconciled with God.
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:45:00.420]   That is our purpose.
[00:45:00.420 --> 00:45:01.420]   That is why we are established.
[00:45:01.420 --> 00:45:03.420]   That is why we are here as a church.
[00:45:03.420 --> 00:45:05.420]   This is his heart.
[00:45:05.420 --> 00:45:06.420]   And so he prays.
[00:45:06.420 --> 00:45:08.420]   Be devoted to prayer.
[00:45:08.420 --> 00:45:11.420]   But in your devotion, it's not just being devoted
[00:45:11.420 --> 00:45:13.420]   and after you make a list of things that you want.
[00:45:13.420 --> 00:45:14.420]   I want my career to be this way.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:15.420]   I want my marriage to be this way.
[00:45:15.420 --> 00:45:17.420]   I want my children to be this way.
[00:45:17.420 --> 00:45:23.420]   All of that, every Buddhist prayer, looks the same.
[00:45:23.420 --> 00:45:25.420]   Making a list of things that you desire
[00:45:25.420 --> 00:45:27.420]   and then taking it to the temple.
[00:45:27.420 --> 00:45:29.420]   Taking it to wherever you go.
[00:45:29.420 --> 00:45:31.420]   Say, "Lord, answer my prayer so that I can have a better business.
[00:45:31.420 --> 00:45:32.420]   My children will be healthier.
[00:45:32.420 --> 00:45:34.420]   We can have a long life."
[00:45:34.420 --> 00:45:36.420]   Every Buddhist prays that same prayer.
[00:45:36.420 --> 00:45:42.420]   Every Mormon, every Catholic, every Muslim prays that same prayer.
[00:45:42.420 --> 00:45:45.420]   If our prayers don't look any different, then we're no different.
[00:45:45.420 --> 00:45:49.420]   We just have chosen this avenue to get what we want.
[00:45:49.420 --> 00:45:53.420]   That's not what he's saying when he says to be devoted to prayer.
[00:45:53.420 --> 00:45:58.420]   He said, "Be devoted to prayer that the door may be open
[00:45:58.420 --> 00:46:02.420]   for the Word to go forth."
[00:46:02.420 --> 00:46:05.420]   But what does an open door look like?
[00:46:05.420 --> 00:46:07.420]   We can be praying for the open door and say,
[00:46:07.420 --> 00:46:09.420]   "Well, I don't see any open doors."
[00:46:09.420 --> 00:46:10.420]   I hear people say that a lot.
[00:46:10.420 --> 00:46:14.420]   It's like, "We live in Orange County, so we don't see a lot of open doors."
[00:46:14.420 --> 00:46:16.420]   We used to see a lot of open doors in China.
[00:46:16.420 --> 00:46:18.420]   We used to see open doors when we traveled,
[00:46:18.420 --> 00:46:23.420]   but we don't see much open doors here because people are not welcoming.
[00:46:23.420 --> 00:46:28.420]   I remember back in the '80s, as a young Christian,
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:31.420]   watching missionaries preparing to go out.
[00:46:31.420 --> 00:46:36.420]   And I remember in send-off services, people would be in tears.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:40.420]   And the reason why they were in tears is because back then,
[00:46:40.420 --> 00:46:45.420]   when people went out to missions, we didn't expect them to come back
[00:46:45.420 --> 00:46:48.420]   because just travel was difficult.
[00:46:48.420 --> 00:46:53.420]   Even in 1993, when I was in China, just to make one phone call cost me $30.
[00:46:53.420 --> 00:46:54.420]   You couldn't just come in and out.
[00:46:54.420 --> 00:46:55.420]   You couldn't communicate like that.
[00:46:55.420 --> 00:46:58.420]   Today, you're on Facebook. You're chatting.
[00:46:58.420 --> 00:47:00.420]   So it's a blessing because we're able to communicate,
[00:47:00.420 --> 00:47:03.420]   and it's easier to travel.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:08.420]   But back then, once you left, that was your life.
[00:47:08.420 --> 00:47:11.420]   I had one of my friends, one of my roommates,
[00:47:11.420 --> 00:47:14.420]   I remember when they were headed out for missions,
[00:47:14.420 --> 00:47:17.420]   he had an aging father that he had to take care of,
[00:47:17.420 --> 00:47:22.420]   and at the end of the day, he entrusted him to the Lord, and he left.
[00:47:22.420 --> 00:47:26.420]   And when he left, he left knowing, or at least believing,
[00:47:26.420 --> 00:47:29.420]   that he's never going to be able to see his dad again.
[00:47:29.420 --> 00:47:32.420]   That's what missions was like back then.
[00:47:32.420 --> 00:47:36.420]   Today, again, it's not a curse.
[00:47:36.420 --> 00:47:39.420]   All of this, if we recognize it for what it is, is a blessing from God
[00:47:39.420 --> 00:47:42.420]   that the world has become a lot more accessible.
[00:47:42.420 --> 00:47:47.420]   But along with that has created a spirit of ease within the church
[00:47:47.420 --> 00:47:52.420]   where an open door means a rolled-out red carpet.
[00:47:52.420 --> 00:47:55.420]   Our bills are paid. Our children are taken care of.
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:57.420]   There's proper schooling for our children.
[00:47:57.420 --> 00:47:59.420]   Our retirement is paid.
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:02.420]   And so all of that's to be laid out, or else the door's not--
[00:48:02.420 --> 00:48:04.420]   door's not open because they don't want us here.
[00:48:04.420 --> 00:48:06.420]   Door's not open because they're hostile.
[00:48:06.420 --> 00:48:08.420]   Door's not open because we don't have enough money.
[00:48:08.420 --> 00:48:11.420]   But look how Paul describes an open door.
[00:48:11.420 --> 00:48:13.420]   In 1 Corinthians 16:9, he says,
[00:48:13.420 --> 00:48:16.420]   "For a wide door for effective service has opened to me,
[00:48:16.420 --> 00:48:20.420]   and there are many adversaries."
[00:48:20.420 --> 00:48:22.420]   I mean, in our culture, he says "many adversaries."
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:25.420]   It means the door's not open, right?
[00:48:25.420 --> 00:48:27.420]   They don't want me there, so maybe the door's not open.
[00:48:27.420 --> 00:48:29.420]   But Paul says, "The door's been wide open,
[00:48:29.420 --> 00:48:33.420]   but there's many people who don't want me to be there."
[00:48:33.420 --> 00:48:36.420]   You notice that Paul says, "Pray for the open door,"
[00:48:36.420 --> 00:48:39.420]   not for him, but for the Word.
[00:48:39.420 --> 00:48:41.420]   For the Word.
[00:48:41.420 --> 00:48:43.420]   Opportunity to share the Gospel.
[00:48:43.420 --> 00:48:46.420]   Opportunity even in the midst of opposition.
[00:48:46.420 --> 00:48:51.420]   In fact, oftentimes, the opposition was what led to the revival.
[00:48:51.420 --> 00:48:54.420]   In Galatians 4, 13-15, he says,
[00:48:54.420 --> 00:48:57.420]   "But you know that it was because of bodily illness
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:01.420]   that I preached the Gospel to you the first time."
[00:49:01.420 --> 00:49:03.420]   Because he was ill.
[00:49:03.420 --> 00:49:06.420]   And we say, "Well, if I'm ill, that means the door is shut."
[00:49:06.420 --> 00:49:09.420]   Because I have to be healthy, the bills have to be paid,
[00:49:09.420 --> 00:49:12.420]   we have to be welcomed, there has to be somebody welcoming us,
[00:49:12.420 --> 00:49:14.420]   and so retirement's going to be good,
[00:49:14.420 --> 00:49:17.420]   but he says, "No, because I was ill,
[00:49:17.420 --> 00:49:21.420]   because God caused me to be ill, the door was open,
[00:49:21.420 --> 00:49:23.420]   and I preached the Gospel to you the first time,
[00:49:23.420 --> 00:49:26.420]   and that which was a trial to you in my bodily condition,
[00:49:26.420 --> 00:49:28.420]   you did not despise or loathe, but you received me
[00:49:28.420 --> 00:49:30.420]   as an angel of God, as Christ Jesus himself."
[00:49:30.420 --> 00:49:35.420]   So open door for him was his illness, was his sickness.
[00:49:35.420 --> 00:49:37.420]   And then 2 Thessalonians 3, 1, he says,
[00:49:37.420 --> 00:49:40.420]   "Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord
[00:49:40.420 --> 00:49:44.420]   will spread rapidly and be glorified just as it did also with you."
[00:49:44.420 --> 00:49:48.420]   He didn't just pray and then wait to see the red carpet.
[00:49:48.420 --> 00:49:50.420]   He said no.
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.420]   He had a sense of urgency to get the Gospel out.
[00:49:54.420 --> 00:49:59.420]   So he prayed and he acted to see in what avenue,
[00:49:59.420 --> 00:50:03.420]   where is the best place for him to go.
[00:50:03.420 --> 00:50:06.420]   In fact, in Ephesians 5, 15-16, "Therefore be careful how you walk,
[00:50:06.420 --> 00:50:10.420]   not as unwise men, but as wise, making the most of your time,
[00:50:10.420 --> 00:50:12.420]   because the days are evil."
[00:50:12.420 --> 00:50:15.420]   Making the most of your time.
[00:50:15.420 --> 00:50:18.420]   Think about what has happened in the last two years,
[00:50:18.420 --> 00:50:19.420]   two and a half years.
[00:50:19.420 --> 00:50:21.420]   The pandemic hit.
[00:50:21.420 --> 00:50:22.420]   Churches were shut down for a period,
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.420]   and some churches shut down a bit longer than that.
[00:50:25.420 --> 00:50:27.420]   More people went online.
[00:50:27.420 --> 00:50:31.420]   And during that period, there was a disturbance in the church
[00:50:31.420 --> 00:50:33.420]   because they were saying this is not essential,
[00:50:33.420 --> 00:50:36.420]   and that you're not allowed to sing, you have to wear a mask.
[00:50:36.420 --> 00:50:40.420]   And so restrictions were given against the Constitution,
[00:50:40.420 --> 00:50:43.420]   and it was outright wrong.
[00:50:43.420 --> 00:50:44.420]   But there was an uproar in the church.
[00:50:44.420 --> 00:50:46.420]   How dare they do this?
[00:50:46.420 --> 00:50:47.420]   How can they do that?
[00:50:47.420 --> 00:50:51.420]   And we live in a free country where we can fight, where we can vote.
[00:50:51.420 --> 00:50:55.420]   But in the midst of this, if we're not careful,
[00:50:55.420 --> 00:51:00.420]   we can completely miss the open door that God has created for us.
[00:51:00.420 --> 00:51:03.420]   That our primary problem should not be complaining
[00:51:03.420 --> 00:51:05.420]   that they're making it harder for us to get together,
[00:51:05.420 --> 00:51:07.420]   but our primary thing is,
[00:51:07.420 --> 00:51:13.420]   what has this caused for the purpose of the gospel?
[00:51:13.420 --> 00:51:21.420]   Doors have been opened more widely than I've seen in my whole ministry career.
[00:51:21.420 --> 00:51:24.420]   People are walking into the church,
[00:51:24.420 --> 00:51:28.420]   wondering if there's more to this life than this, than ever before.
[00:51:28.420 --> 00:51:34.420]   Just non-Christians who've never attended church are just walking in, asking questions.
[00:51:34.420 --> 00:51:38.420]   I've had phone calls at the beginning of the pandemic
[00:51:38.420 --> 00:51:40.420]   from people that I've known when they were younger,
[00:51:40.420 --> 00:51:43.420]   who've fallen away many years ago, calling me,
[00:51:43.420 --> 00:51:45.420]   because they were scared.
[00:51:45.420 --> 00:51:47.420]   Because they walked away from their faith,
[00:51:47.420 --> 00:51:49.420]   and they were scared that maybe they're going to fall,
[00:51:49.420 --> 00:51:51.420]   and then they don't want to die in that state.
[00:51:51.420 --> 00:51:53.420]   So they were calling me, asking me for prayer,
[00:51:53.420 --> 00:51:57.420]   so they would bring to prayer and repentance and come back.
[00:51:57.420 --> 00:52:00.420]   And it all happened because of the pandemic.
[00:52:00.420 --> 00:52:05.420]   That although on the surface, there were some restrictions and discomfort,
[00:52:05.420 --> 00:52:10.420]   but behind the scene, it was clear that God was working.
[00:52:10.420 --> 00:52:15.420]   When our mind and heart is focused on ourselves, it's easy to miss that.
[00:52:15.420 --> 00:52:20.420]   That God has opened doors to make every opportunity.
[00:52:20.420 --> 00:52:22.420]   That when we're sick, we're in the hospital,
[00:52:22.420 --> 00:52:23.420]   we say, "Oh, God is stopping us,"
[00:52:23.420 --> 00:52:27.420]   He says, "But there's tons of people, nurses, doctors, other patients."
[00:52:27.420 --> 00:52:31.420]   I feel like the hospital is one of the best places to share the gospel,
[00:52:31.420 --> 00:52:34.420]   because people are desperate, they're in need.
[00:52:34.420 --> 00:52:38.420]   Those of you who are nurses, those of you who are teachers,
[00:52:38.420 --> 00:52:41.420]   those of you who are in the corporate, working,
[00:52:41.420 --> 00:52:47.420]   doors are open when we are praying and asking God, and we are seeking.
[00:52:47.420 --> 00:52:51.420]   And there's a sense of urgency.
[00:52:51.420 --> 00:52:55.420]   But when we look for an open door, meaning they're inviting us,
[00:52:55.420 --> 00:52:59.420]   the red carpet, and I come to, I'm desperate, can you come teach me?
[00:52:59.420 --> 00:53:00.420]   What is the gospel?
[00:53:00.420 --> 00:53:02.420]   We're all looking for that Ethiopian eunuch.
[00:53:02.420 --> 00:53:04.420]   It's like, "What prevents me from being baptized?"
[00:53:04.420 --> 00:53:06.420]   Like, man, I wish that happened every day.
[00:53:06.420 --> 00:53:10.420]   That didn't happen, so there's no door open.
[00:53:10.420 --> 00:53:16.420]   Paul was eagerly, "Devote yourself to prayer for opportunities to preach the gospel,"
[00:53:16.420 --> 00:53:20.420]   he says, "so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ."
[00:53:20.420 --> 00:53:24.420]   Speak forth, to proclaim the mystery of Christ.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:27.420]   Why is the gospel called the mystery?
[00:53:27.420 --> 00:53:30.420]   Is it because he means it to be mysterious?
[00:53:30.420 --> 00:53:34.420]   No one is really supposed to understand this, it's the mystery.
[00:53:34.420 --> 00:53:36.420]   It's meant to be mysterious.
[00:53:36.420 --> 00:53:39.420]   Is that what he means?
[00:53:39.420 --> 00:53:40.420]   Clearly it is not.
[00:53:40.420 --> 00:53:44.420]   There are some parts of it where it's reflective of what the Bible says,
[00:53:44.420 --> 00:53:47.420]   but repeatedly over and over again in the New Testament,
[00:53:47.420 --> 00:53:51.420]   the gospel is called the mystery of Christ.
[00:53:51.420 --> 00:53:57.420]   You know, I looked up to see, like online, to see what is a mystery?
[00:53:57.420 --> 00:53:59.420]   How does the world describe a mystery?
[00:53:59.420 --> 00:54:04.420]   And I came across seven things that is required to be a good mystery, right?
[00:54:04.420 --> 00:54:05.420]   Seven things.
[00:54:05.420 --> 00:54:08.420]   And this is not a Christian thing, it's just their definition of,
[00:54:08.420 --> 00:54:11.420]   if you're going to make a movie, if you're going to make a mystery novel,
[00:54:11.420 --> 00:54:12.420]   you need seven things.
[00:54:12.420 --> 00:54:17.420]   First, it says it requires a strong hook, meaning a problem,
[00:54:17.420 --> 00:54:18.420]   something that draws you in.
[00:54:18.420 --> 00:54:23.420]   So if you watch a movie, like it starts with an event, boom, you know,
[00:54:23.420 --> 00:54:26.420]   they're all having drinks and they're having fun,
[00:54:26.420 --> 00:54:30.420]   and boom, the light turns off and somebody's dead, right?
[00:54:30.420 --> 00:54:34.420]   And usually some kind of a big crime, who did it?
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:37.420]   So it says every mystery has a strong hook.
[00:54:37.420 --> 00:54:40.420]   Well, what's the hook in Christianity?
[00:54:40.420 --> 00:54:42.420]   All of sin falls short of the glory of God.
[00:54:42.420 --> 00:54:46.420]   Genesis begins with God's glory in creation, and then he says,
[00:54:46.420 --> 00:54:50.420]   "If you eat of the tree of knowledge of good and evil, you shall surely die."
[00:54:50.420 --> 00:54:53.420]   And they eat.
[00:54:53.420 --> 00:54:56.420]   And as a result of that, God said, "You're going to die."
[00:54:56.420 --> 00:55:00.420]   So the hook is, the problem is, how are we going to solve this
[00:55:00.420 --> 00:55:03.420]   when God clearly says in the beginning that we're going to die?
[00:55:03.420 --> 00:55:06.420]   Do we just die and that's it?
[00:55:06.420 --> 00:55:12.420]   So the whole book of the Bible is solving this problem.
[00:55:12.420 --> 00:55:14.420]   Is that it?
[00:55:14.420 --> 00:55:17.420]   Well, second thing it says, there's a detective.
[00:55:17.420 --> 00:55:19.420]   They call it a sleuth, there's somebody who's there who's examining,
[00:55:19.420 --> 00:55:20.420]   trying to figure this out.
[00:55:20.420 --> 00:55:24.420]   So every mystery has somebody who's there trying to figure this out.
[00:55:24.420 --> 00:55:27.420]   Well, that's me and you, right?
[00:55:27.420 --> 00:55:30.420]   The whole purpose of reading the Bible is to get the hook,
[00:55:30.420 --> 00:55:32.420]   this is the problem, how do we figure this out?
[00:55:32.420 --> 00:55:35.420]   And we're examining and putting the pieces together.
[00:55:35.420 --> 00:55:39.420]   And then third, it says it requires a villain, right?
[00:55:39.420 --> 00:55:41.420]   Somebody who's always trying to mess up the story.
[00:55:41.420 --> 00:55:42.420]   And who is that?
[00:55:42.420 --> 00:55:44.420]   The Antichrist from the get-go.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:46.420]   He's tripping people up in everything that God is doing.
[00:55:46.420 --> 00:55:49.420]   There's an anti-movement to trip you up.
[00:55:49.420 --> 00:55:52.420]   Fourthly, there's a flowing narrative.
[00:55:52.420 --> 00:55:54.420]   That every part of this mystery, they're all connected together.
[00:55:54.420 --> 00:55:58.420]   So something that you found out in chapter 2, you reveal is connected to this.
[00:55:58.420 --> 00:56:01.420]   And then you see Genesis, how connected to Leviticus,
[00:56:01.420 --> 00:56:04.420]   and how Leviticus is connected to the book of Daniel.
[00:56:04.420 --> 00:56:08.420]   And you see a flowing narrative, what we call the meta-narrative.
[00:56:08.420 --> 00:56:12.420]   Meta-narrative is every part of the Bible that's connected to each other.
[00:56:12.420 --> 00:56:14.420]   A flowing narrative.
[00:56:14.420 --> 00:56:18.420]   Fifthly, it says it needs trails of clues.
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:22.420]   Clues are dropped all throughout this meta-narrative
[00:56:22.420 --> 00:56:25.420]   to kind of get you to be sucked in, that this is coming,
[00:56:25.420 --> 00:56:27.420]   that this is what's going on, but this is coming.
[00:56:27.420 --> 00:56:28.420]   What is that?
[00:56:28.420 --> 00:56:30.420]   They're the prophets.
[00:56:30.420 --> 00:56:33.420]   All throughout the Bible, the prophets are dropping hints here,
[00:56:33.420 --> 00:56:36.420]   this is coming, we know this is what's happening, and this caused this,
[00:56:36.420 --> 00:56:40.420]   but at the end, this is what it's leading to.
[00:56:40.420 --> 00:56:43.420]   Sixthly, it says there's a red herring.
[00:56:43.420 --> 00:56:45.420]   Meaning there's things that cause you to go astray,
[00:56:45.420 --> 00:56:49.420]   thinking like maybe this is the answer, and you realize that's not the answer.
[00:56:49.420 --> 00:56:51.420]   Maybe this is the answer, that's not the answer.
[00:56:51.420 --> 00:56:53.420]   Who's that? Those are the false prophets.
[00:56:53.420 --> 00:56:55.420]   False teachers.
[00:56:55.420 --> 00:56:59.420]   Promising peace while they themselves are prisoners of their own flesh.
[00:57:00.420 --> 00:57:03.420]   Again, this is not--I didn't get this from the Bible.
[00:57:03.420 --> 00:57:06.420]   This is what Hollywood's saying is if you want to make a good narrative,
[00:57:06.420 --> 00:57:08.420]   write a good mystery, this is what's required.
[00:57:08.420 --> 00:57:12.420]   And then, seventhly, satisfying ending.
[00:57:12.420 --> 00:57:14.420]   That there is a conclusion to this.
[00:57:14.420 --> 00:57:17.420]   You don't start with a hook and say, "Oh, well," and then it finishes.
[00:57:17.420 --> 00:57:23.420]   The purpose of this is to draw the people into the narrative
[00:57:23.420 --> 00:57:30.420]   so that when we come to the conclusion, we all realize how we got here.
[00:57:30.420 --> 00:57:34.420]   That's why you can't jump into the middle of the story in the mystery,
[00:57:34.420 --> 00:57:36.420]   because by the time you get to the conclusion,
[00:57:36.420 --> 00:57:39.420]   you don't really understand why this needed to be solved.
[00:57:39.420 --> 00:57:41.420]   So, why does he present it this way?
[00:57:41.420 --> 00:57:43.420]   Why does he present the gospel?
[00:57:43.420 --> 00:57:47.420]   Why does he just say they sinned, Jesus came, you believe, and we're in heaven,
[00:57:47.420 --> 00:57:49.420]   and then let's just celebrate in heaven?
[00:57:49.420 --> 00:57:51.420]   Why all this drama?
[00:57:51.420 --> 00:57:53.420]   That's the reason why you get hooked on mystery,
[00:57:53.420 --> 00:57:59.420]   because as you get hooked on the mystery, we become engaged in this story.
[00:57:59.420 --> 00:58:02.420]   We're not just studying it. We're not just examining it.
[00:58:02.420 --> 00:58:09.420]   We're engaged. We become part of this story as we try to unravel this problem.
[00:58:09.420 --> 00:58:11.420]   And as we observe what God is doing throughout history,
[00:58:11.420 --> 00:58:18.420]   by the time when Christ comes and we are glorified, we're part of this story.
[00:58:18.420 --> 00:58:22.420]   We're not just observers. All for what purpose?
[00:58:22.420 --> 00:58:28.420]   So that he may open our eyes to the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:58:28.420 --> 00:58:32.420]   That we may know the value of what we have in him.
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.420]   And that's why Paul says to be devoted in prayer,
[00:58:35.420 --> 00:58:38.420]   so that the door may be opened for the word,
[00:58:38.420 --> 00:58:41.420]   that I may speak forth to proclaim the mystery of Christ,
[00:58:41.420 --> 00:58:48.420]   that I may make it clear, so that other people may be drawn into this mystery.
[00:58:48.420 --> 00:58:51.420]   Not just to say, "Yeah, I believe,"
[00:58:51.420 --> 00:58:57.420]   but to be sucked into this mystery so that we may celebrate Christ together.
[00:58:57.420 --> 00:59:00.420]   That's why Paul says in 1 Corinthians 2, 1-5,
[00:59:00.420 --> 00:59:06.420]   he says the power of the gospel is the message itself, is Christ crucified.
[00:59:06.420 --> 00:59:08.420]   1 Corinthians 2, 1-5, "And when I came to you, brethren,
[00:59:08.420 --> 00:59:11.420]   I did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom."
[00:59:11.420 --> 00:59:17.420]   He was not a salesman. Paul was not effective because he was gifted in speaking.
[00:59:17.420 --> 00:59:22.420]   In fact, the New Testament describes him as they weren't impressed with his preaching.
[00:59:22.420 --> 00:59:27.420]   Apollos was the preacher. Peter was the man of action.
[00:59:27.420 --> 00:59:32.420]   Paul was more like a scholar. But they were not impressed with his preaching.
[00:59:32.420 --> 00:59:36.420]   He said, "I did not come with superiority of speech or wisdom,
[00:59:36.420 --> 00:59:38.420]   proclaiming to you the testimony of God."
[00:59:38.420 --> 00:59:43.420]   Think about it. If his primary call was to make the gospel clear,
[00:59:43.420 --> 00:59:49.420]   you would think that the best person for this is the most gifted speaker.
[00:59:49.420 --> 00:59:53.420]   God didn't pick the most gifted speaker.
[00:59:53.420 --> 00:59:57.420]   He was a passionate man. He loved the Lord,
[00:59:57.420 --> 01:00:00.420]   but he was a broken man who recognized his own sins.
[01:00:00.420 --> 01:00:03.420]   "I didn't come with superiority of wisdom,
[01:00:03.420 --> 01:00:09.420]   for I determined to know nothing among you except Jesus Christ and Him crucified.
[01:00:09.420 --> 01:00:13.420]   I was with you in weakness and in fear and in much trembling."
[01:00:13.420 --> 01:00:18.420]   In other words, I can't take the credit for what happened.
[01:00:18.420 --> 01:00:23.420]   If you were to look to me, it says I was weak, I was trembling, I was in fear.
[01:00:23.420 --> 01:00:25.420]   I wasn't fruitful because I was gifted.
[01:00:25.420 --> 01:00:30.420]   I wasn't fruitful because I knew better or I was more disciplined.
[01:00:30.420 --> 01:00:33.420]   The power is in the cross, it says.
[01:00:33.420 --> 01:00:36.420]   "And my message and my preaching were not in persuasive words of wisdom,
[01:00:36.420 --> 01:00:38.420]   but in demonstration of the Spirit and power,
[01:00:38.420 --> 01:00:43.420]   so that your faith would not rest on the wisdom of man, but on the power of God."
[01:00:43.420 --> 01:00:46.420]   Now, some people look at this and say, "Well, he demonstrated the power of God.
[01:00:46.420 --> 01:00:48.420]   He was an apostle, so he performed miracles."
[01:00:48.420 --> 01:00:53.420]   Now, that's not something we can do, so therefore this is not relevant to us.
[01:00:53.420 --> 01:00:56.420]   Now, we may not be apostles and we may not be showing sign gifts,
[01:00:56.420 --> 01:01:00.420]   but that same Holy Spirit is in us.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:03.420]   That power is also in us.
[01:01:03.420 --> 01:01:07.420]   He was able to perform miracles because there were sign gifts to prove who he was.
[01:01:07.420 --> 01:01:12.420]   But that same Holy Spirit, that same power resides in us.
[01:01:12.420 --> 01:01:18.420]   So he says he was determined that in his preaching, that in his sharing,
[01:01:18.420 --> 01:01:23.420]   that the power of the Holy Spirit, not his power, but the power of the Holy Spirit is demonstrated.
[01:01:23.420 --> 01:01:29.420]   Now, let me break this down in practicality, what that looks like.
[01:01:29.420 --> 01:01:35.420]   When we pray, we're communing with the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:35.420 --> 01:01:40.420]   And we are abiding by the Holy Spirit, just as Jesus said in John 15,
[01:01:40.420 --> 01:01:42.420]   "You cannot bear fruit unless you are abiding in me."
[01:01:42.420 --> 01:01:44.420]   And then he was talking about the Holy Spirit that's going to come,
[01:01:44.420 --> 01:01:46.420]   the Counselor who's going to teach you all things.
[01:01:46.420 --> 01:01:50.420]   And you need to continue abiding in the Holy Spirit if you want to bear fruit.
[01:01:50.420 --> 01:01:54.420]   So when we pray, we are communing and abiding in the Holy Spirit.
[01:01:54.420 --> 01:02:00.420]   So when the Holy Spirit is ignited in us, if you can use those words,
[01:02:00.420 --> 01:02:04.420]   when the Holy Spirit is groaning on our behalf, what happens?
[01:02:04.420 --> 01:02:08.420]   The spiritual things become more real.
[01:02:08.420 --> 01:02:13.420]   We sing every week songs, we study doctrines, but our problem is
[01:02:13.420 --> 01:02:16.420]   our life doesn't take us down that direction.
[01:02:16.420 --> 01:02:20.420]   Our natural life takes us down a direction like everybody else.
[01:02:20.420 --> 01:02:23.420]   We're worried about paying bills and taking care of our children
[01:02:23.420 --> 01:02:26.420]   and getting jobs and being sick and not getting sick
[01:02:26.420 --> 01:02:29.420]   and putting enough money in retirement.
[01:02:29.420 --> 01:02:31.420]   And so that's our natural life.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.420]   So we come to church, at best, 10% of your life, at best,
[01:02:35.420 --> 01:02:40.420]   it's probably not even 10%, 10% of your life you're being reminded
[01:02:40.420 --> 01:02:43.420]   that this is empty.
[01:02:43.420 --> 01:02:45.420]   We're going to go. We're just sojourners passing through.
[01:02:45.420 --> 01:02:50.420]   But the 90% of our life is, "I don't want my kids to miss out.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:53.420]   I want to give what's best for my children.
[01:02:53.420 --> 01:02:56.420]   I want to live a long life. I want my parents to do well.
[01:02:56.420 --> 01:02:58.420]   I want to financially be stable."
[01:02:58.420 --> 01:03:01.420]   And that's where 90% of our energy goes to.
[01:03:01.420 --> 01:03:06.420]   But when the Holy Spirit is ignited in us, all of a sudden,
[01:03:06.420 --> 01:03:10.420]   everything that we profess to believe becomes real.
[01:03:10.420 --> 01:03:14.420]   It becomes real, that this is just--we're just passing through.
[01:03:14.420 --> 01:03:17.420]   We see everything through the lens of the Holy Spirit.
[01:03:17.420 --> 01:03:21.420]   And when that happens, conviction comes over us.
[01:03:21.420 --> 01:03:26.420]   Conviction. Not just profession, but conviction.
[01:03:26.420 --> 01:03:29.420]   We can profess, we can sing about the words that we sing,
[01:03:29.420 --> 01:03:33.420]   but you know the difference between convicted by those words
[01:03:33.420 --> 01:03:36.420]   and just hearing and singing those words.
[01:03:36.420 --> 01:03:41.420]   So when the Holy Spirit is working in us, conviction, things become real.
[01:03:41.420 --> 01:03:46.420]   Life and death and judgment and grace and eternity becomes real.
[01:03:46.420 --> 01:03:49.420]   It's not just a doctrine of the church, it's the reality of our lives.
[01:03:49.420 --> 01:03:54.420]   And then when conviction happens, conviction brings boldness.
[01:03:54.420 --> 01:04:01.420]   When you see somebody who is on a boat, ready to fall off of a cliff, or a fall,
[01:04:01.420 --> 01:04:04.420]   your natural reaction--because if you believe that that's happening,
[01:04:04.420 --> 01:04:07.420]   your natural reaction is, "Get off that boat!"
[01:04:07.420 --> 01:04:14.420]   You don't have to be an extrovert to have boldness.
[01:04:14.420 --> 01:04:18.420]   Boldness doesn't come from training. Boldness doesn't come from talent.
[01:04:18.420 --> 01:04:21.420]   Boldness comes from conviction.
[01:04:21.420 --> 01:04:24.420]   If you believe that that's what's happening, your natural knee-jerk reaction,
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:27.420]   no matter what kind of person, no matter what gifting you have,
[01:04:27.420 --> 01:04:31.420]   your natural reaction is, "Turn!"
[01:04:31.420 --> 01:04:33.420]   Or else death is on the other side.
[01:04:33.420 --> 01:04:38.420]   But the reason why we don't feel a sense of urgency is because of lack of conviction.
[01:04:38.420 --> 01:04:43.420]   And the reason we have lack of conviction is because we're not walking in the Spirit.
[01:04:43.420 --> 01:04:48.420]   And the reason why we're not walking in the Spirit is because we're not praying.
[01:04:48.420 --> 01:04:54.420]   So what we are engaged in requires us to pray, to open our eyes, to be convicted.
[01:04:54.420 --> 01:05:00.420]   And this conviction leads to boldness, and this conviction also leads to compassion.
[01:05:00.420 --> 01:05:07.420]   Because if we're really convicted that this boat is going to fall off the edge,
[01:05:07.420 --> 01:05:11.420]   we don't look at them as, "Oh, we're so disgusted by these people because they don't listen.
[01:05:11.420 --> 01:05:15.420]   We're so disgusted because they're so dumb."
[01:05:15.420 --> 01:05:19.420]   Even though they oppose us, even though they hate us,
[01:05:19.420 --> 01:05:24.420]   we're headed to eternal life, and they're headed to eternal judgment.
[01:05:24.420 --> 01:05:28.420]   And that causes us to be compassionate.
[01:05:28.420 --> 01:05:34.420]   And it is our compassion that causes us to pray for the lost souls.
[01:05:34.420 --> 01:05:39.420]   And this is the circular life of a Christian.
[01:05:39.420 --> 01:05:43.420]   That we come before the Lord, devoting ourselves to pray,
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:46.420]   opportunity for the gospel to be preached.
[01:05:46.420 --> 01:05:49.420]   He gives us conviction and boldness and compassion,
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:55.420]   which leads us to deeper prayer, more urgent prayer.
[01:05:55.420 --> 01:06:08.420]   I'm going to conclude today's message of how the prayer was unfolding in Paul's life.
[01:06:08.420 --> 01:06:12.420]   As he was asking, "Devote yourself to prayer, Lord, for the word to be opened,
[01:06:12.420 --> 01:06:18.420]   so that I may make the mystery of Christ, to make it clear."
[01:06:18.420 --> 01:06:23.420]   Well, those of you who were with us in the study of the Book of Romans,
[01:06:23.420 --> 01:06:25.420]   you remember how Romans ended.
[01:06:25.420 --> 01:06:30.420]   Romans, Book of Romans, at the end in chapter 15, ends with Paul's plea for prayer.
[01:06:30.420 --> 01:06:33.420]   And this is what he says, Romans 15, 30-33.
[01:06:33.420 --> 01:06:37.420]   "Now I urge you, brethren, by our Lord Jesus Christ, and by the love of the Spirit,
[01:06:37.420 --> 01:06:41.420]   to strive together with me in your prayers to God for me."
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:45.420]   So he asked for prayer. He ends almost every letter with petition for prayer.
[01:06:45.420 --> 01:06:48.420]   But I want you to pay attention to specifically what he prays for.
[01:06:48.420 --> 01:06:52.420]   Now understand that Romans was written while Paul was in Corinth.
[01:06:52.420 --> 01:06:55.420]   He's never been to Rome. He's hoping to go to Rome.
[01:06:55.420 --> 01:06:59.420]   So he's at the tail end of his third missionary journey,
[01:06:59.420 --> 01:07:04.420]   and he's writing to the Roman Christians because that's the epicenter of the world at that time.
[01:07:04.420 --> 01:07:06.420]   That's where the power of Rome was.
[01:07:06.420 --> 01:07:10.420]   And if you wanted to be anybody, you needed to be able to go to Rome.
[01:07:10.420 --> 01:07:15.420]   But the problem was the persecution was so heavy
[01:07:15.420 --> 01:07:18.420]   that in Jerusalem there are people waiting to kill him.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:23.420]   And it's almost impossible to go to Rome because of what's happening with the Romans.
[01:07:23.420 --> 01:07:27.420]   But he says, "I'm praying." There's a reason why he was avoiding this trip,
[01:07:27.420 --> 01:07:30.420]   but he said, "Pray for me so that the door may be open so that I may come to you."
[01:07:30.420 --> 01:07:32.420]   But this is specifically how he prays.
[01:07:32.420 --> 01:07:35.420]   "That I may be rescued from those who are disobedient in Judea,
[01:07:35.420 --> 01:07:40.420]   and that my service for Jerusalem may prove acceptable to the saints."
[01:07:40.420 --> 01:07:45.420]   Pray that I can go to Jerusalem, and these people who hate me,
[01:07:45.420 --> 01:07:48.420]   they're waiting for me to show up so they can kill me for protection.
[01:07:48.420 --> 01:07:51.420]   But not only protection so that I don't get hurt,
[01:07:51.420 --> 01:07:55.420]   but that I may preach the gospel and minister to the saints.
[01:07:55.420 --> 01:08:00.420]   In this very hostile--I mean, that's where it started, remember?
[01:08:00.420 --> 01:08:03.420]   That's where the first martyr happened.
[01:08:03.420 --> 01:08:05.420]   That's where the gospel was first preached.
[01:08:05.420 --> 01:08:08.420]   And that's where the persecution was so intense.
[01:08:08.420 --> 01:08:11.420]   And Apostle Paul was the one who was in the middle of all of that.
[01:08:11.420 --> 01:08:14.420]   And he said he wants to go back to Jerusalem knowing that they want to kill him.
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:18.420]   So pray for me so that I can go there and be protected, but still be able to minister.
[01:08:18.420 --> 01:08:21.420]   And then he says, "So that I may come to you."
[01:08:21.420 --> 01:08:26.420]   "So that I may come to you in joy by the will of God and find refreshing rest in your company."
[01:08:26.420 --> 01:08:31.420]   I want to ultimately do ministry in Jerusalem and then end up in Rome
[01:08:31.420 --> 01:08:34.420]   so that I can continue to minister and preach the gospel there.
[01:08:34.420 --> 01:08:38.420]   Humanly, that's like going into North Korea.
[01:08:38.420 --> 01:08:42.420]   Pray that I may go into North Korea and not only be protected and not get arrested,
[01:08:42.420 --> 01:08:47.420]   but that I may have fruitful ministry out in North Korea knowing everybody is coming to get me.
[01:08:47.420 --> 01:08:53.420]   And then after that, when I'm done, pray that I can go and talk to Kim Jong-un himself.
[01:08:53.420 --> 01:08:58.420]   That's what that prayer would have sounded like.
[01:08:58.420 --> 01:09:05.420]   Well, when you look at the book of Acts, it tells us how this unfolds.
[01:09:05.420 --> 01:09:11.420]   Paul, after he writes his letter, about a year later, he is planning to go to Jerusalem.
[01:09:11.420 --> 01:09:16.420]   And the prophet Agabus comes and says, "You can't go to Jerusalem because God has revealed to me
[01:09:16.420 --> 01:09:20.420]   when you go there, you're going to be bound. They're going to put you in prison."
[01:09:20.420 --> 01:09:24.420]   Paul responds to them, "Not only am I willing to be put into prison, I'm ready to die for this."
[01:09:24.420 --> 01:09:26.420]   And they couldn't persuade him.
[01:09:26.420 --> 01:09:31.420]   So they spent all night praying for him, weeping because they were afraid that they're never going to see him.
[01:09:31.420 --> 01:09:33.420]   Paul is determined.
[01:09:33.420 --> 01:09:38.420]   Sure enough, in chapter 21, 27, he shows up in Jerusalem and he enters into the temple.
[01:09:38.420 --> 01:09:41.420]   And they recognize him. As soon as they recognize him, a mob forms.
[01:09:41.420 --> 01:09:45.420]   That's the guy we've been made. He's the guy who's been disturbing our faith.
[01:09:45.420 --> 01:09:50.420]   And so a mob comes and attacks him and beats him and ready to kill him.
[01:09:50.420 --> 01:09:57.420]   But then the Roman guards hear about this and the high officials say, "We've got to stop this or we're going to have a riot among us."
[01:09:57.420 --> 01:10:02.420]   They go down with soldiers and they protect him.
[01:10:02.420 --> 01:10:03.420]   They protect him.
[01:10:03.420 --> 01:10:06.420]   So they can't touch him anymore because the Roman guards have come.
[01:10:06.420 --> 01:10:13.420]   And instead of walking out of that safely, Apostle Paul says, "Give me an opportunity to defend myself."
[01:10:13.420 --> 01:10:14.420]   So he said, "Okay."
[01:10:14.420 --> 01:10:19.420]   So he turns around and the mob that wants to kill him, he preaches the gospel.
[01:10:19.420 --> 01:10:24.420]   But they can't touch him because the Roman guards are protecting him.
[01:10:24.420 --> 01:10:27.420]   So he preaches the gospel and they're infuriated. They're angry.
[01:10:27.420 --> 01:10:33.420]   So they demand of the Roman guards saying, "This is not right.
[01:10:33.420 --> 01:10:40.420]   We need to crucify this man just like his Lord was crucified."
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:47.420]   So by the protection of the Roman guards, they take him and place him in front of Ananias, the leaders of Israel.
[01:10:47.420 --> 01:10:50.420]   And he says, "Okay, what do you have to say for yourself?"
[01:10:50.420 --> 01:10:52.420]   And he preaches the gospel.
[01:10:52.420 --> 01:10:57.420]   And they can't touch him because the Roman guards are protecting him.
[01:10:57.420 --> 01:11:00.420]   So can you imagine the stir?
[01:11:00.420 --> 01:11:10.420]   People are so angry with him. It says that 40 Jews took a vow of starvation until this man is killed.
[01:11:10.420 --> 01:11:15.420]   And so they were scheming and said, "You know, when he gets moved from there to go to Felix,
[01:11:15.420 --> 01:11:19.420]   we're going to find the road that he's going to take and the 40 of us are going to jump in and he's going to kill.
[01:11:19.420 --> 01:11:23.420]   And we're committed to this."
[01:11:23.420 --> 01:11:27.420]   And then a family member of Paul hears about this and then he goes and tells.
[01:11:27.420 --> 01:11:31.420]   And then the Roman guards are ignited.
[01:11:31.420 --> 01:11:35.420]   And look what it says, Acts 23, 23 to 25.
[01:11:35.420 --> 01:11:40.420]   "Get 200 soldiers ready by the third hour of the night to proceed to Caesarea.
[01:11:40.420 --> 01:11:50.420]   With 70 horsemen and 200 spearmen, they were also to provide mounts to put Paul on and bring him safely to Felix, the governor."
[01:11:50.420 --> 01:11:59.420]   470 soldiers. 470 soldiers are ignited to protect him so that he can get.
[01:11:59.420 --> 01:12:03.420]   So all the while he's in Jerusalem in the area ministering to God.
[01:12:03.420 --> 01:12:08.420]   And I always wonder whatever happened to those 40 people.
[01:12:08.420 --> 01:12:12.420]   I figured like, you know, maybe some of them starve to death.
[01:12:12.420 --> 01:12:18.420]   My guess is at some point they had, you know, maybe it was kind of rash.
[01:12:18.420 --> 01:12:21.420]   You know, it doesn't tell us what happened.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:24.420]   They just kind of just disappear.
[01:12:24.420 --> 01:12:29.420]   Paul, under the protection of the Roman guards, put into house arrest.
[01:12:29.420 --> 01:12:36.420]   And Felix, not because he had some sympathy toward Christians, but because of his greed,
[01:12:36.420 --> 01:12:40.420]   protects him, puts him under house arrest, and this is what it says.
[01:12:40.420 --> 01:12:45.420]   Acts chapter 22, 23, sorry, 24 verse 23.
[01:12:45.420 --> 01:12:51.420]   "Then he gave orders to the centurion for him to be kept in custody and yet have some freedom
[01:12:51.420 --> 01:12:55.420]   and not to prevent any of his friends from ministering to him."
[01:12:55.420 --> 01:12:58.420]   You notice that?
[01:12:58.420 --> 01:13:03.420]   Under the protection of these Roman guards, he said because he wanted a kickback,
[01:13:03.420 --> 01:13:08.420]   he was hoping that Paul, this man seems like he's connected and maybe he'll give us some money.
[01:13:08.420 --> 01:13:12.420]   So he kept him there for two years, protecting him.
[01:13:12.420 --> 01:13:17.420]   And he said, "Give him some freedom and let his friends come back and forth and minister to him."
[01:13:17.420 --> 01:13:19.420]   For two years!
[01:13:19.420 --> 01:13:26.420]   Under the protection of the Roman guards, he's ministering to people there, preaching the gospel.
[01:13:26.420 --> 01:13:28.420]   I mean, check, right?
[01:13:28.420 --> 01:13:31.420]   Who could have imagined, like, what could he have orchestrated?
[01:13:31.420 --> 01:13:34.420]   What planning, what training would have provided that?
[01:13:34.420 --> 01:13:38.420]   It was supernatural. Only a sovereign God could have done that.
[01:13:38.420 --> 01:13:43.420]   After two years, Felix realizes he's not going to get any kickback.
[01:13:43.420 --> 01:13:48.420]   The next governor comes, Festus. He stands before Festus and begins to preach the gospel.
[01:13:48.420 --> 01:13:51.420]   But Festus is a just man.
[01:13:51.420 --> 01:13:54.420]   He hears the case and he says, "This man has done nothing wrong.
[01:13:54.420 --> 01:13:56.420]   He should be released."
[01:13:56.420 --> 01:13:59.420]   But Paul didn't want to get released.
[01:13:59.420 --> 01:14:06.420]   He said, "I'm a Roman citizen. I demand, I demand an audience with Kim Jong-un, Caesar."
[01:14:06.420 --> 01:14:08.420]   Right?
[01:14:08.420 --> 01:14:12.420]   They said, "Because this man has done nothing wrong, but because he appealed to Caesar,
[01:14:12.420 --> 01:14:15.420]   by law we have to send him."
[01:14:15.420 --> 01:14:17.420]   So he chooses to remain in custody.
[01:14:17.420 --> 01:14:23.420]   This is awesome! I'm preaching the gospel with Roman guards protecting me at the epicenter!
[01:14:23.420 --> 01:14:25.420]   He said, "But now it's time to go to Rome."
[01:14:25.420 --> 01:14:29.420]   So they put him on a boat, and on this boat with Roman guards,
[01:14:29.420 --> 01:14:33.420]   they run into all kinds of trouble, and they think they're going to die.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:37.420]   And they're worshiping their idols, and then Paul stands up in the middle of this,
[01:14:37.420 --> 01:14:41.420]   and the God that I serve has told me this, and you do this, and this, and this.
[01:14:41.420 --> 01:14:44.420]   And then he saves all of them!
[01:14:44.420 --> 01:14:48.420]   So they begin to say, "Oh my gosh, your God is the true God."
[01:14:48.420 --> 01:14:55.420]   And so all of a sudden he wins the whole guard over, and then they end up in Malta to recoup.
[01:14:55.420 --> 01:15:00.420]   And while they're at Malta, a vandal comes and bites Paul.
[01:15:00.420 --> 01:15:03.420]   So all the people in Malta say, "He must have done something wrong.
[01:15:03.420 --> 01:15:07.420]   He survived the shipwreck, but clearly the gods are against him because he was bitten.
[01:15:07.420 --> 01:15:11.420]   They're waiting for him to die, but he doesn't die."
[01:15:11.420 --> 01:15:15.420]   And because he doesn't die, all of a sudden their opinion completely changes.
[01:15:15.420 --> 01:15:19.420]   This guy was saved from a shipwreck, and he survives the venom!
[01:15:19.420 --> 01:15:22.420]   God, his God, must be the real God!
[01:15:22.420 --> 01:15:26.420]   And so not only does he win over the guards, he wins over Malta,
[01:15:26.420 --> 01:15:32.420]   and then he gets on his boat, and they finally end up in Rome under the protection of these guards.
[01:15:32.420 --> 01:15:34.420]   But he's not just any prisoner.
[01:15:34.420 --> 01:15:37.420]   He's the guy who saved them.
[01:15:37.420 --> 01:15:39.420]   There's something supernatural about this man.
[01:15:39.420 --> 01:15:43.420]   So even before he goes, he comes to Rome, and they're not hostile.
[01:15:43.420 --> 01:15:45.420]   They're intrigued by him.
[01:15:45.420 --> 01:15:48.420]   Look what it says in Acts 28, 28-25.
[01:15:48.420 --> 01:15:53.420]   "When they had set a day for Paul, they came to him at his lodging in large numbers."
[01:15:53.420 --> 01:15:56.420]   So he was kind of like a celebrity already.
[01:15:56.420 --> 01:15:59.420]   So they're coming, they're intrigued, so they're coming to him.
[01:15:59.420 --> 01:16:03.420]   "And he was explaining to them by solemnly testifying about the kingdom of God
[01:16:03.420 --> 01:16:08.420]   and trying to persuade them concerning Jesus from both the law of Moses and from the prophets
[01:16:08.420 --> 01:16:10.420]   from morning until evening.
[01:16:10.420 --> 01:16:14.420]   Some were being persuaded by the things spoken, but others would not believe."
[01:16:14.420 --> 01:16:18.420]   Paul was making clear the mystery of the gospel of Jesus Christ
[01:16:18.420 --> 01:16:22.420]   under the protection of the guards as a celebrity,
[01:16:22.420 --> 01:16:24.420]   and they're coming. He's not going out looking for them.
[01:16:24.420 --> 01:16:29.420]   He's not church planting. He's just in his prison, whatever that is, right, at that moment.
[01:16:29.420 --> 01:16:32.420]   They're coming to him asking questions, and then some people are persuaded
[01:16:32.420 --> 01:16:35.420]   and some people are not, and those who are not persuaded
[01:16:35.420 --> 01:16:39.420]   usually were angry and want to kill him, but they can't touch him
[01:16:39.420 --> 01:16:42.420]   because the guards are protecting him.
[01:16:42.420 --> 01:16:45.420]   And then in Acts 28, 30-31, it says this,
[01:16:45.420 --> 01:16:49.420]   "And he stayed two full years in his own rented quarters
[01:16:49.420 --> 01:16:52.420]   and was welcoming all who came to him,
[01:16:52.420 --> 01:16:56.420]   preaching the kingdom of God and teaching concerning the Lord Jesus Christ
[01:16:56.420 --> 01:17:02.420]   with all openness unhindered."
[01:17:02.420 --> 01:17:05.420]   How could you have planned that?
[01:17:05.420 --> 01:17:07.420]   How can any man have orchestrated that?
[01:17:07.420 --> 01:17:10.420]   If we didn't study the Bible, we wouldn't have known
[01:17:10.420 --> 01:17:15.420]   that this was a specific answer to the prayer at the end of the Book of Romans.
[01:17:15.420 --> 01:17:20.420]   I remember the first time coming through the Book of Acts after,
[01:17:20.420 --> 01:17:23.420]   and it's like, "Oh my gosh, it's like a puzzle coming together."
[01:17:23.420 --> 01:17:26.420]   I've never read this in any commentary. I've never heard anybody preach on it,
[01:17:26.420 --> 01:17:30.420]   but clearly it's spelled out here, and I remember the chills that I got.
[01:17:30.420 --> 01:17:34.420]   It's almost kind of like God opening up the curtain.
[01:17:34.420 --> 01:17:40.420]   If we feel that way reading this, can you imagine how Paul felt
[01:17:40.420 --> 01:17:45.420]   as he prayed, as doors being opened, protection of the guards,
[01:17:45.420 --> 01:17:51.420]   they're coming to him, and you say God's not real?
[01:17:51.420 --> 01:17:55.420]   And you say God's not real?
[01:17:55.420 --> 01:17:59.420]   When we don't pray, we don't understand.
[01:17:59.420 --> 01:18:02.420]   God is just a theory.
[01:18:02.420 --> 01:18:08.420]   That's why you can admire him, you can sing songs,
[01:18:08.420 --> 01:18:14.420]   you can study, but you're unwilling to give everything to follow him
[01:18:14.420 --> 01:18:18.420]   because it's a theory, because it's theology.
[01:18:18.420 --> 01:18:23.420]   But when we pray according to his heart, his will, he said, "I will answer."
[01:18:23.420 --> 01:18:27.420]   Ask whatever you wish, I will answer.
[01:18:27.420 --> 01:18:33.420]   That's what causes us to evaluate everything with that lens.
[01:18:33.420 --> 01:18:37.420]   If we don't understand the heart of God, you can spend all your life
[01:18:37.420 --> 01:18:43.420]   raising godly children, paying your bills, saving up for retirement,
[01:18:43.420 --> 01:18:47.420]   and look no different than any other religion.
[01:18:47.420 --> 01:18:52.420]   You're just doing it in the name of Jesus, but it's about you,
[01:18:52.420 --> 01:18:58.420]   your safety, your children, even the discipleship, all of it.
[01:18:58.420 --> 01:19:04.420]   But when we see things through this lens, good and bad is evaluated
[01:19:04.420 --> 01:19:08.420]   by whether this is happening or not.
[01:19:08.420 --> 01:19:13.420]   Persecution is good if the gospel is more powerful.
[01:19:13.420 --> 01:19:18.420]   Sickness is good if that opens the door for the gospel to be preached.
[01:19:18.420 --> 01:19:26.420]   Even early death is good in that perspective if the gospel is able to spread.
[01:19:26.420 --> 01:19:30.420]   We have to know more than the mind of God.
[01:19:30.420 --> 01:19:34.420]   We have to interact and fellowship with the heart of God.
[01:19:34.420 --> 01:19:37.420]   Because when he said that he came to give this life abundantly,
[01:19:37.420 --> 01:19:42.420]   can you imagine the joy of Apostle Paul, even in the midst of being beaten
[01:19:42.420 --> 01:19:48.420]   and early death, to be in the midst and in the middle of the will of God?
[01:19:48.420 --> 01:19:53.420]   That knowing that he's fellowshipping with God, he's walking with God,
[01:19:53.420 --> 01:19:55.420]   he's working with God.
[01:19:55.420 --> 01:19:58.420]   And then that's why we can understand, and only then can you understand
[01:19:58.420 --> 01:20:03.420]   when Paul says, "If you ask me, do I want to depart or stay here?
[01:20:03.420 --> 01:20:06.420]   Do I want to get out of this prison?" He says in Philippians 1.
[01:20:06.420 --> 01:20:10.420]   "Do I want to get out of prison and live a long, prosperous life?
[01:20:10.420 --> 01:20:12.420]   Or do I want to die and be with the Lord?"
[01:20:12.420 --> 01:20:16.420]   He said, "If you ask me, if I want to be selfish, I'm ready to go.
[01:20:16.420 --> 01:20:20.420]   I want to meet this Lord face to face, the person I've been worshipping,
[01:20:20.420 --> 01:20:23.420]   the one who saved me, the one who's so gracious to me,
[01:20:23.420 --> 01:20:25.420]   the one I've been communing with.
[01:20:25.420 --> 01:20:27.420]   I want to go."
[01:20:27.420 --> 01:20:29.420]   But because it means more fruitful labor for you,
[01:20:29.420 --> 01:20:33.420]   I know that I'm going to stay because God's not done with me here.
[01:20:33.420 --> 01:20:38.420]   Can you imagine the joy? Can you imagine the worship?
[01:20:38.420 --> 01:20:42.420]   Can you imagine the passion that Apostle Paul lived with?
[01:20:42.420 --> 01:20:47.420]   That even as he is being beheaded, it was glory.
[01:20:47.420 --> 01:20:56.420]   My prayer is that in some small way, that we would taste what that feels like,
[01:20:56.420 --> 01:21:03.420]   that we would devote ourselves to pray, devote ourselves to what God is pursuing,
[01:21:03.420 --> 01:21:09.420]   that somehow, someway this year, that we would become prayer warriors,
[01:21:09.420 --> 01:21:12.420]   not just the leaders but the church,
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:15.420]   and that we would actively pursue what He is pursuing through us.
[01:21:15.420 --> 01:21:17.420]   Let's pray.
[01:21:22.420 --> 01:21:27.420]   Let's take a few minutes to come before the Lord in prayer.
[01:21:27.420 --> 01:21:30.420]   Again, asking specifically,
[01:21:30.420 --> 01:21:33.420]   what does devoting yourself to prayer look like practically in your life,
[01:21:33.420 --> 01:21:38.420]   not just wishful thinking, but how is that going to be applied in our lives?
[01:21:38.420 --> 01:21:41.420]   What doors are open? Ask God to open my eyes to see.
[01:21:41.420 --> 01:21:47.420]   What doors has He opened that I'm not being obedient to?
[01:21:47.420 --> 01:21:52.420]   Let's really commit ourselves to be devoted to pray, to make the gospel clear.
[01:21:52.420 --> 01:21:55.420]   Let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us.

[01:23:49.420 --> 01:23:57.420]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:23:59.420 --> 01:24:02.420]   [Piano music]
[01:24:02.420 --> 01:24:26.420]   For my waking breath, for my daily breath,
[01:24:27.420 --> 01:24:35.420]   I depend on You, I depend on You,
[01:24:35.420 --> 01:24:45.420]   for the sun to rise, for my sleep at night.
[01:24:45.420 --> 01:24:56.420]   I depend on You, I depend on You.
[01:24:56.420 --> 01:25:01.420]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:25:01.420 --> 01:25:06.420]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:25:06.420 --> 01:25:11.420]   I'm the bridge and You are the vine.
[01:25:11.420 --> 01:25:17.420]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:25:17.420 --> 01:25:21.420]   [Piano music]
[01:25:23.420 --> 01:25:29.420]   You're the spirit, You're the spirit.
[01:25:29.420 --> 01:25:44.420]   As I follow You, I depend on You, I depend on You.
[01:25:45.420 --> 01:25:53.420]   The rain don't stop, still it flies high.
[01:25:53.420 --> 01:26:04.420]   I depend on You, I depend on You.
[01:26:04.420 --> 01:26:09.420]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:26:09.420 --> 01:26:14.420]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:26:14.420 --> 01:26:18.420]   I'm the bridge and You are the vine.
[01:26:18.420 --> 01:26:24.420]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:26:24.420 --> 01:26:28.420]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:26:28.420 --> 01:26:33.420]   Be my all, my treasure, my light.
[01:26:33.420 --> 01:26:38.420]   I am Yours forever, You're mine.
[01:26:39.420 --> 01:26:45.420]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:26:45.420 --> 01:26:49.420]   [Piano music]
[01:26:49.420 --> 01:26:56.420]   When I pass, when I pass through death,
[01:26:56.420 --> 01:27:06.420]   as I enter Heaven's, I depend on You.
[01:27:07.420 --> 01:27:11.420]   I depend on You.
[01:27:11.420 --> 01:27:21.420]   Eternal life to be raised with Christ.
[01:27:21.420 --> 01:27:31.420]   I depend on You, I depend on You.
[01:27:32.420 --> 01:27:37.420]   You're the way, the truth, and the light.
[01:27:37.420 --> 01:27:42.420]   You're the well that never runs dry.
[01:27:42.420 --> 01:27:46.420]   I'm the bridge and You are the vine.
[01:27:46.420 --> 01:27:51.420]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:27:51.420 --> 01:27:56.420]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:27:56.420 --> 01:28:01.420]   Be my all, my treasure, my pride.
[01:28:01.420 --> 01:28:06.420]   I am Yours forever, You're mine.
[01:28:06.420 --> 01:28:11.420]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:28:11.420 --> 01:28:16.420]   Be my strength, my song in the night.
[01:28:16.420 --> 01:28:21.420]   Be my all, my treasure, my pride.
[01:28:21.420 --> 01:28:26.420]   I am Yours forever, You're mine.
[01:28:27.420 --> 01:28:33.420]   Draw me close and teach me to abide.
[01:28:33.420 --> 01:28:36.420]   Let's pray.
[01:28:36.420 --> 01:28:41.420]   Now may the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:28:41.420 --> 01:28:45.420]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:28:45.420 --> 01:28:49.420]   the eternal love of God the Father,
[01:28:49.420 --> 01:28:55.420]   rest, encourage, rebuke, and strengthen the Church, Lord God,
[01:28:56.420 --> 01:29:00.420]   wherever You send us, that we would be the sweet aroma of Christ.
[01:29:00.420 --> 01:29:05.420]   May Christ's name be exalted in our private lives.
[01:29:05.420 --> 01:29:10.420]   May Christ's name be adored and exalted in our public lives.
[01:29:10.420 --> 01:29:16.420]   May You and You alone receive all the glory wherever You send us.
[01:29:16.420 --> 01:29:19.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
[01:29:19.420 --> 01:29:24.420]   God sent His Son
[01:29:25.420 --> 01:29:30.420]   They called Him Jesus
[01:29:30.420 --> 01:29:35.420]   He came to love
[01:29:35.420 --> 01:29:40.420]   Heal and forgive
[01:29:40.420 --> 01:29:46.420]   He lived and died
[01:29:46.420 --> 01:29:51.420]   To buy my party
[01:29:52.420 --> 01:29:57.420]   An empty grave is there to
[01:29:57.420 --> 01:30:02.420]   My Savior lay
[01:30:02.420 --> 01:30:07.420]   Because He lives
[01:30:07.420 --> 01:30:12.420]   I can face tomorrow
[01:30:12.420 --> 01:30:17.420]   Because He lives
[01:30:18.420 --> 01:30:23.420]   All fear is gone
[01:30:23.420 --> 01:30:28.420]   Because I know
[01:30:28.420 --> 01:30:33.420]   He holds the future
[01:30:33.420 --> 01:30:38.420]   And life is worth the living
[01:30:38.420 --> 01:30:44.420]   Just because He lives
[01:30:46.420 --> 01:30:52.420]   Faithful forever You will be
[01:30:52.420 --> 01:30:57.420]   Faithful You are
[01:30:57.420 --> 01:31:04.420]   All Your promises are yes and Amen
[01:31:04.420 --> 01:31:11.420]   All Your promises are yes and Amen
[01:31:12.420 --> 01:31:16.420]   [Music]
[01:31:16.420 --> 01:31:30.420]   Beautiful Savior You have brought me near
[01:31:30.420 --> 01:31:36.420]   You pulled me from the ashes You have broken every curse
[01:31:37.420 --> 01:31:44.420]   Blessed Redeemer You have set this character free
[01:31:44.420 --> 01:31:49.420]   Lord I can't help but sing
