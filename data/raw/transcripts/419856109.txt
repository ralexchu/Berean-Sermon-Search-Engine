[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.160]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:08.080]   We're going to be finishing up the I Am Statement.
[00:00:08.080 --> 00:00:09.600]   That's on chapter 15, the part two.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:14.740]   I didn't get to finish last week, so we're going to finish the part two for this week.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:21.240]   So please turn your Bibles to John chapter 15 and let me read from verse 1 through 11.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:25.320]   Okay, John chapter 15, verses 1 through 11.
[00:00:25.320 --> 00:00:28.000]   I am the true vine and my Father is the vinedresser.
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.140]   Every branch in me that does not bear fruit, he takes away.
[00:00:31.140 --> 00:00:36.080]   And every branch that bears fruit, he prunes it so that it may bear more fruit.
[00:00:36.080 --> 00:00:40.200]   You are already clean because of the word which I have spoken to you.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:45.000]   Abide in me and I in you, as the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   vine, so neither can you unless you abide in me.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:49.760]   I am the vine and you are the branches.
[00:00:49.760 --> 00:00:53.280]   He who abides in me and I in him, he bears much fruit.
[00:00:53.280 --> 00:00:55.900]   For apart from me, you can do nothing.
[00:00:55.900 --> 00:01:00.400]   If anyone does not abide in me, he is thrown away as a branch and dries up, and they gather
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:03.680]   them and cast them into the fire and they are burned.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:07.160]   If you abide in me and my words abide in you, ask whatever you wish and it will be done
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:08.320]   for you.
[00:01:08.320 --> 00:01:14.040]   My Father is glorified by this that you bear much fruit and so prove to be my disciples.
[00:01:14.040 --> 00:01:18.640]   Just as the Father has loved me and I have also loved you, abide in my love.
[00:01:18.640 --> 00:01:22.920]   If you keep my commandments, you will abide in my love, just as I have kept my Father's
[00:01:22.920 --> 00:01:25.120]   commandments and abide in his love.
[00:01:25.120 --> 00:01:29.500]   These things I have spoken to you so that my joy may be in you and that your joy may
[00:01:29.500 --> 00:01:30.500]   be made full.
[00:01:30.500 --> 00:01:31.500]   Let's pray.
[00:01:31.500 --> 00:01:36.900]   Gracious Father, we pray for your blessing over this time.
[00:01:36.900 --> 00:01:43.080]   We pray, Father God, that your Holy Spirit would illumine our hearts, that we may understand
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:47.600]   and that we may be convicted, that we may live lives truly bearing fruit as we abide
[00:01:47.600 --> 00:01:48.600]   in Christ.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.360]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:52.360 --> 00:01:57.500]   All right, so I think we're in what, seventh or eighth week into our lockdown and I know
[00:01:57.500 --> 00:02:00.140]   many of you, your life doesn't look much different.
[00:02:00.140 --> 00:02:05.860]   Maybe you're even busier than before because you're going to work physically and you come
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:09.260]   home and you got to take care of the kids who are not at school and so maybe some of
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.060]   you, I know some of you are busier, but there's a lot of us.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:19.860]   And again, we're home, we're eager for the doors to open and for us to come back to church,
[00:02:19.860 --> 00:02:25.580]   but you know, being locked down, like sometimes I wake up and I don't know if it's Monday,
[00:02:25.580 --> 00:02:29.260]   I don't know if it's Saturday, you know, it's kind of like Groundhog Day.
[00:02:29.260 --> 00:02:32.940]   I don't know if you've ever saw that movie with Bill Murray where he wakes up and same
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:37.680]   thing happens day after day after day and then, you know, sometimes it kind of feels
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.260]   like that, right?
[00:02:39.260 --> 00:02:43.380]   Even this morning, I was talking to Pastor Mark this morning, I actually had to go record
[00:02:43.380 --> 00:02:48.780]   a sermon for a friend's church and usually I know it's Sunday because I preach.
[00:02:48.780 --> 00:02:50.900]   You know, I wake up in the morning thinking about the sermon.
[00:02:50.900 --> 00:02:56.700]   So I had to give a sermon yesterday and I went to sleep kind of winding down and then
[00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.740]   I woke up this morning thinking it was Monday and I was just relaxing on my bed thinking
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:06.420]   like what am I going to do and grab some coffee, do my devotions and then it all of a sudden
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:08.700]   hit me, it's like, oh shoot, it's Sunday.
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:12.300]   And so I kind of had to hurry and get out of the house and I don't know about you, but
[00:03:12.300 --> 00:03:17.700]   you know, the days are kind of bleeding into the other days and again, I'm eager to have
[00:03:17.700 --> 00:03:23.540]   the country open back up and us getting back to work and what we need to do.
[00:03:23.540 --> 00:03:31.420]   You know, bearing fruit that we talked about last week is absolutely important, right?
[00:03:31.420 --> 00:03:35.300]   Whether it's as a Christian or just regular part of life and if you're doing anything
[00:03:35.300 --> 00:03:41.060]   and you don't see progress, eventually you're going to lose motivation.
[00:03:41.060 --> 00:03:44.900]   The text that we're looking at this morning is about bearing fruit and the reason why
[00:03:44.900 --> 00:03:50.060]   Jesus says this to his disciples before he leaves is because he's preparing them to continue
[00:03:50.060 --> 00:03:53.220]   the work that he started after he leaves.
[00:03:53.220 --> 00:03:58.700]   That their primary task was to take this gospel message, the hope of his death and resurrection
[00:03:58.700 --> 00:04:03.180]   and go plant churches and spread the gospel and make sure that the world hears about and
[00:04:03.180 --> 00:04:06.260]   knows about the hope that we have in Jesus Christ.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:10.760]   But he wanted to, as he is preparing them, he also wanted to warn them that the only
[00:04:10.760 --> 00:04:16.540]   way that they're going to really bear fruit is if they abide in Christ.
[00:04:16.540 --> 00:04:20.140]   That is the only way that they can truly bear fruit.
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:24.940]   In John chapter 15, verse 4, it says, "Abide in me and I in you, and as the branch cannot
[00:04:24.940 --> 00:04:30.140]   bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide
[00:04:30.140 --> 00:04:31.140]   in me."
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:36.780]   So let's stop right there and really understand what he is saying here in verse 4, the magnitude
[00:04:36.780 --> 00:04:38.340]   of what he's saying.
[00:04:38.340 --> 00:04:42.080]   He's not saying that you're not going to bear good fruit.
[00:04:42.080 --> 00:04:44.880]   He's not saying that you're not going to bear much fruit.
[00:04:44.880 --> 00:04:48.640]   He says you cannot bear any fruit.
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:52.480]   You can't bear any fruit unless you're abiding in me.
[00:04:52.480 --> 00:04:57.000]   So in other words, from this point on, after I leave, the Holy Spirit is going to come
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:02.680]   and if you do not abide, if you do not continue, you will bear no fruit.
[00:05:02.680 --> 00:05:04.160]   You will work hard.
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.640]   You will be persecuted.
[00:05:06.640 --> 00:05:08.280]   You will plant church.
[00:05:08.280 --> 00:05:12.760]   You will do all of these things, but you will bear no fruit.
[00:05:12.760 --> 00:05:19.840]   You know, I think one of the biggest lies that the world tells, you know, especially
[00:05:19.840 --> 00:05:27.160]   the young ones in our culture, is that, you know, you would see a great basketball star
[00:05:27.160 --> 00:05:31.820]   after he wins the championship and they interviewed him, "What's the secret to your success?"
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:38.380]   And you would hear this cliche that if you believe in yourself, you can accomplish anything.
[00:05:38.380 --> 00:05:43.340]   I mean, he may believe that, but it is an absolute lie.
[00:05:43.340 --> 00:05:45.040]   That's a lie.
[00:05:45.040 --> 00:05:50.940]   If you believe in yourself that you can fly, you're not going to fly.
[00:05:50.940 --> 00:05:52.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:53.340]   You can believe in yourself.
[00:05:53.340 --> 00:06:00.620]   If you're 5'5", 250 pounds or, you know, whatever you may be, you're not going to dunk.
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:06.380]   No matter how much you believe in yourself, there are things that you just cannot do,
[00:06:06.380 --> 00:06:07.460]   right?
[00:06:07.460 --> 00:06:10.860]   But if you're being trained, like, no, if you believe in yourself, you just put your
[00:06:10.860 --> 00:06:15.300]   effort in, you know, somebody has a company that's multi-billion dollars.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.100]   If you just believe in yourself, you'll be a billionaire yourself, right?
[00:06:20.100 --> 00:06:27.820]   Now that may sound like good advice, like you could try harder, but the problem is that
[00:06:27.820 --> 00:06:34.820]   they can endeavor to do something and not only not achieve that, but in the process
[00:06:34.820 --> 00:06:38.180]   just being utterly broken.
[00:06:38.180 --> 00:06:44.220]   It doesn't even come close, and then you kind of lose motivation to do anything else.
[00:06:44.220 --> 00:06:51.480]   There's a lot of Christians who are working hard and laboring and sacrificing, and maybe
[00:06:51.480 --> 00:06:55.940]   you've done that for many, many years, and you look at your Christian life now, and it
[00:06:55.940 --> 00:07:00.180]   is nowhere near where you thought you would have been.
[00:07:00.180 --> 00:07:03.700]   I mean, I could tell you, I'm one of those people, you know, I got saved early, and I
[00:07:03.700 --> 00:07:09.940]   thought by the time I was 40 years old that I would have had, you know, like I would have
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:14.500]   been a certain level, you know, I would have had the whole Bible memorized, you know, when
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:15.500]   I was younger.
[00:07:15.500 --> 00:07:19.740]   But the ministry that we were a part of was really into Bible memory, and I knew this
[00:07:19.740 --> 00:07:24.420]   guy who was, even before Pastor Peter Chung, we had a guy in our Bible study who would
[00:07:24.420 --> 00:07:29.300]   memorize books, you know, we would come with two verses, and he would come with, "Oh, I
[00:07:29.300 --> 00:07:33.660]   memorized 1 Timothy this week," and then a month later he would say, "Oh, I got 2 Timothy
[00:07:33.660 --> 00:07:35.660]   done," and he would just memorize it.
[00:07:35.660 --> 00:07:40.700]   So I remember when I was young, being in that Bible study thing, you know what, my memory
[00:07:40.700 --> 00:07:45.020]   is not as good as him, but by the time I'm 40, right, I'm going to have this, and I'm
[00:07:45.020 --> 00:07:47.660]   going to have this memorized, and I'm going to have this much of the Bible, I'm going
[00:07:47.660 --> 00:07:52.260]   to have, you know, have so many people evangelized, so many people discipled.
[00:07:52.260 --> 00:08:01.620]   Well, I'm over 50, and I'm nowhere near what I was hoping to be when I was 40 years old.
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:07.140]   There's a lot of us who are frustrated, maybe frustrated, because we, it's not because you
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:16.100]   haven't tried, you've tried, and it just didn't turn out the way that you were hoping for.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:24.020]   He says clearly, "True fruit, true fruit is only going to happen when you abide in the
[00:08:24.020 --> 00:08:28.260]   true vine," right?
[00:08:28.260 --> 00:08:31.380]   That pretty much summarizes everything I'm going to say this morning, okay?
[00:08:31.380 --> 00:08:35.380]   So if you're going to go to sleep, like, make sure you memorize that, right?
[00:08:35.380 --> 00:08:40.980]   True fruit can only happen when you abide by the true vine.
[00:08:40.980 --> 00:08:47.540]   So when you're not abiding by the true vine, whatever fruit that you may think that you
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:56.340]   see may not be real fruit, unless the Bible is lying, right?
[00:08:56.340 --> 00:09:02.860]   True fruit can only come from abiding by the true vine.
[00:09:02.860 --> 00:09:10.460]   You can teach the Bible regularly, not abiding in Christ, and really bear no fruit.
[00:09:10.460 --> 00:09:16.740]   You can go to short-term missions, share the gospel with many people, and not be abiding
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:19.420]   in Him and bear no fruit.
[00:09:19.420 --> 00:09:24.660]   You can have a growing church filled with hundreds, even thousands of people, when we
[00:09:24.660 --> 00:09:29.700]   are not abiding in Christ isn't true fruit.
[00:09:29.700 --> 00:09:36.100]   Everything that we experience, or what seems to be fruit outside of abiding in Christ,
[00:09:36.100 --> 00:09:38.440]   may not be real fruit at all.
[00:09:38.440 --> 00:09:45.260]   And sometimes it's actually more dangerous to be surrounded by what we think is fruit
[00:09:45.260 --> 00:09:50.140]   when the Bible says, "No, it's not real fruit at all," because He said you cannot bear any
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.340]   fruit unless you are abiding in Christ.
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:10:00.180]   So how central is this message to the church and to Christianity in general?
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:02.300]   In everything that we do, how central?
[00:10:02.300 --> 00:10:05.580]   This is the core, right?
[00:10:05.580 --> 00:10:09.500]   If you missed this, you've missed everything about our Christian faith.
[00:10:09.500 --> 00:10:15.540]   So our primary pursuit, before we evangelize the world, before we attract people to the
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:19.600]   church, before we even open it back up so that we can have corporate worship, our primary
[00:10:19.600 --> 00:10:25.140]   pursuit has to be, are we abiding in Christ?
[00:10:25.140 --> 00:10:31.180]   Luke 6, 43-44, it says, "For no good tree bears bad fruit, nor, again, does a bad tree
[00:10:31.180 --> 00:10:32.180]   bear good fruit.
[00:10:32.180 --> 00:10:34.500]   For each tree is known by its own fruit.
[00:10:34.500 --> 00:10:40.140]   For figs are not gathered from thorn bushes, nor are grapes picked from bramble bush."
[00:10:40.140 --> 00:10:44.380]   It says you cannot bear fruit.
[00:10:44.380 --> 00:10:50.780]   So the central question that we have to ask is, then what does it mean to abide in Christ?
[00:10:50.780 --> 00:10:52.380]   What does it mean to abide in Christ?
[00:10:52.380 --> 00:10:56.300]   I remember the first time when I was studying this passage and doing quiet time, I just
[00:10:56.300 --> 00:11:00.580]   assumed abide basically meant to obey, right?
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:01.580]   Obey Christ.
[00:11:01.580 --> 00:11:06.260]   As long as you obey, as long as you do what he tells you to do, then we're going to bear
[00:11:06.260 --> 00:11:07.660]   fruit.
[00:11:07.660 --> 00:11:15.180]   But the word for abide here is much more nuanced than just simple obedience.
[00:11:15.180 --> 00:11:20.380]   He's telling his disciples more than just, "Just do what I say," which is part of the
[00:11:20.380 --> 00:11:21.380]   meaning.
[00:11:21.380 --> 00:11:25.140]   In fact, I asked you, I think last week, to look up different translations to see how
[00:11:25.140 --> 00:11:29.260]   this word is translated because this is one of those words that can't be translated with
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:30.940]   one English word.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:34.980]   So if you speak more than one language, you know that there are certain words that you
[00:11:34.980 --> 00:11:40.740]   really need to understand the culture to be able to translate and really have a correct
[00:11:40.740 --> 00:11:42.580]   and precise understanding of that word.
[00:11:42.580 --> 00:11:44.340]   Well, this is one of those words.
[00:11:44.340 --> 00:11:46.620]   In the Greek, it's meno.
[00:11:46.620 --> 00:11:49.100]   So some of your translations will say abide.
[00:11:49.100 --> 00:11:52.300]   Some of your translations will say to remain.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.300]   Some of your translations in other parts of the Bible, that same word is translated to
[00:11:56.300 --> 00:11:59.220]   dwell.
[00:11:59.220 --> 00:12:05.460]   So what I want to do this morning is, again, to jump into the specific nuanced meaning
[00:12:05.460 --> 00:12:10.720]   of this word because it's central to us bearing fruit, no matter what we do.
[00:12:10.720 --> 00:12:18.060]   The first and the most obvious thing that he is saying is to dwell, to dwell in Christ,
[00:12:18.060 --> 00:12:19.060]   to dwell in Christ.
[00:12:19.060 --> 00:12:22.020]   In other words, to make your home in Christ.
[00:12:22.020 --> 00:12:29.200]   And we talked about that last week, how the Holy Spirit was sent and he dwelt within us
[00:12:29.200 --> 00:12:33.100]   and so he said the Holy Spirit isn't going to leave us as orphans.
[00:12:33.100 --> 00:12:37.820]   And so as he dwells in us, he says that you need to also dwell within him to make your
[00:12:37.820 --> 00:12:38.820]   home.
[00:12:38.820 --> 00:12:41.980]   And there's a big difference, right?
[00:12:41.980 --> 00:12:47.060]   As like sleeping at a hotel, this is where you sleep versus your home, right?
[00:12:47.060 --> 00:12:48.300]   And you know what your home is.
[00:12:48.300 --> 00:12:53.940]   Home is you can go out and have the best vacation, but the end of it, you know, you always look
[00:12:53.940 --> 00:12:56.940]   forward to going home because home is where your bed is.
[00:12:56.940 --> 00:12:58.820]   Home is where your fridge is.
[00:12:58.820 --> 00:13:00.980]   Home is where your bathroom, your showers, right?
[00:13:00.980 --> 00:13:02.780]   And your comfortable stuff is.
[00:13:02.780 --> 00:13:06.160]   And home is ultimately where your family is.
[00:13:06.160 --> 00:13:12.020]   And so when you are at home is when you find refuge, when you find your comfort.
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:18.220]   So when he says to make your dwelling in Christ, he's saying make sure that Christ himself
[00:13:18.220 --> 00:13:19.700]   is your refuge.
[00:13:19.700 --> 00:13:20.820]   He's your home.
[00:13:20.820 --> 00:13:27.820]   He's the one that you run to before you run to your friends, before you run to the leaders,
[00:13:27.820 --> 00:13:34.020]   before you run to see if your bank account has enough money, that Christ himself is our
[00:13:34.020 --> 00:13:35.020]   home.
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:38.760]   You know, as soon as the lockdown happened and you can just see the various responses
[00:13:38.760 --> 00:13:45.260]   that people have, you know, with this COVID-19 and understandably, you know, a lot of people
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:46.500]   freaked out.
[00:13:46.500 --> 00:13:50.700]   Most of us freaked out because the real threat of death, if you know, they were thrown out
[00:13:50.700 --> 00:13:56.700]   this just outrageous numbers of millions of people may possibly die.
[00:13:56.700 --> 00:14:00.380]   And every single one of us is going to know somebody who's going to get it and then die
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.380]   from it.
[00:14:01.380 --> 00:14:03.700]   And so these crazy numbers were being thrown out.
[00:14:03.700 --> 00:14:08.940]   And a lot of this lockdown happened because of fear of death.
[00:14:08.940 --> 00:14:14.580]   But I think in some sense was good for us as Christians, because it caused us to take
[00:14:14.580 --> 00:14:21.800]   a step back and ask ourselves, do I fear God more than death itself?
[00:14:21.800 --> 00:14:24.460]   Or do I fear like the rest of the world?
[00:14:24.460 --> 00:14:25.460]   What do I run to?
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:26.460]   Do I run to the supermarket?
[00:14:26.460 --> 00:14:31.620]   And if I have enough things stored up in my garage that I'm safe, did I get enough toilet
[00:14:31.620 --> 00:14:32.620]   paper?
[00:14:32.620 --> 00:14:33.940]   Did I get enough hand sanitizers?
[00:14:33.940 --> 00:14:36.600]   Is my job going to be safe after all this is over?
[00:14:36.600 --> 00:14:37.940]   Is that going to happen?
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:41.780]   Or if I don't have enough money, is the government going to pass a bill where they're going to
[00:14:41.780 --> 00:14:43.020]   help me for a while?
[00:14:43.020 --> 00:14:45.740]   Where is our refuge?
[00:14:45.740 --> 00:14:48.220]   Well first and foremost, Jesus is saying, I'm going to leave you.
[00:14:48.220 --> 00:14:51.500]   And he's talking to people who are anxious because he's about to leave them.
[00:14:51.500 --> 00:14:54.520]   And he says, I'm not going to leave you as orphans.
[00:14:54.520 --> 00:14:58.820]   As the Holy Spirit is going to be sent and he's going to indwell in you, you need to
[00:14:58.820 --> 00:15:01.980]   also continue to dwell with him.
[00:15:01.980 --> 00:15:07.300]   In Psalm 27, 4-5, it says, "One thing I have asked of the Lord that I shall seek, that
[00:15:07.300 --> 00:15:10.900]   I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life."
[00:15:10.900 --> 00:15:15.140]   When he says one thing that I ask, he's not saying he's one of many things.
[00:15:15.140 --> 00:15:21.100]   He's saying above all these other things, I ask more than anything else, more than long
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:25.980]   life, more than prosperity, more than safety from this world, more than a good government,
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:30.100]   more than a good king, one thing that I ask that I may dwell in the house of the Lord
[00:15:30.100 --> 00:15:33.120]   all the days of my life.
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:36.300]   To behold his beauty.
[00:15:36.300 --> 00:15:42.900]   Because beholding his beauty, beholding his glory can't be done when we are away from
[00:15:42.900 --> 00:15:44.200]   him.
[00:15:44.200 --> 00:15:48.060]   When our hearts are chasing after the things of this world, the greatest consequence of
[00:15:48.060 --> 00:15:52.880]   drifting away from God is that we no longer behold his glory.
[00:15:52.880 --> 00:15:56.680]   And that's why he says, "I want to be in the house of the Lord that I may continue to behold
[00:15:56.680 --> 00:16:01.100]   his glory and to meditate in his temple, in his home.
[00:16:01.100 --> 00:16:05.060]   For in a day of trouble, he will conceal me in his tabernacle."
[00:16:05.060 --> 00:16:14.220]   In other words, if Christ is our home, if he is our dwelling, when I am in his temple,
[00:16:14.220 --> 00:16:21.220]   he will protect me, not the walls of my house, not the economy, not some vaccine, but he
[00:16:21.220 --> 00:16:22.740]   will concede me.
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.880]   In the secret place of his tent, he will hide me.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.420]   He will lift me up on a rock.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:31.100]   In other words, he's my foundation.
[00:16:31.100 --> 00:16:35.580]   We can find a vaccine tomorrow and all of a sudden this fear of death goes away, at
[00:16:35.580 --> 00:16:38.060]   least this small part of it.
[00:16:38.060 --> 00:16:42.060]   There's a thousand different ways that we can die, but at least this part of it that's
[00:16:42.060 --> 00:16:45.740]   being hyped up right now, that'll be taken care of.
[00:16:45.740 --> 00:16:50.140]   But the psalmist says, "That's not where I find my refuge.
[00:16:50.140 --> 00:16:53.540]   That is not where I find my rock."
[00:16:53.540 --> 00:16:55.240]   He says, "It is in his temple.
[00:16:55.240 --> 00:16:56.240]   It is in his house.
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:57.240]   He conceals me.
[00:16:57.240 --> 00:16:58.240]   He hides me.
[00:16:58.240 --> 00:17:00.620]   He's the one who lifts me up on a rock."
[00:17:00.620 --> 00:17:04.180]   That's what it means to dwell, to remain in Christ.
[00:17:04.180 --> 00:17:10.300]   In Psalm 84, 10 through 11, he also says, "For a day in your courts is better than
[00:17:10.300 --> 00:17:12.940]   a thousand outside.
[00:17:12.940 --> 00:17:17.260]   I would rather stand at the threshold of the household of my God than dwell in the tents
[00:17:17.260 --> 00:17:18.260]   of the wickedness."
[00:17:18.260 --> 00:17:22.300]   In other words, he's saying, "I'd rather be in a courtyard of my God's house than
[00:17:22.300 --> 00:17:23.780]   to be in the inner room."
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.500]   In other words, in its comfort.
[00:17:26.500 --> 00:17:28.780]   That's what he means.
[00:17:28.780 --> 00:17:34.340]   To be near the Lord is much better, to be in the inner chamber of the world.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:36.660]   "For the Lord God is a sun and a shield.
[00:17:36.660 --> 00:17:39.180]   The Lord gives grace and glory.
[00:17:39.180 --> 00:17:42.740]   No good thing does he withhold from those who walk uprightly."
[00:17:42.740 --> 00:17:48.220]   Well, so how do we make this dwelling?
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:54.180]   The question that we have to ask ourselves and answer repeatedly, over and over again,
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:58.220]   from time to time, is, "Do you believe this?"
[00:17:58.220 --> 00:18:04.220]   When Jesus says he is the resurrection and life, that even if you die, you shall live.
[00:18:04.220 --> 00:18:07.740]   And he asks them, "Do you believe this?"
[00:18:07.740 --> 00:18:10.780]   When he asks his disciple, "Who do men say that I am?"
[00:18:10.780 --> 00:18:12.900]   You're the prophet, you're Elijah.
[00:18:12.900 --> 00:18:16.780]   He said, "But who do you say that I am?"
[00:18:16.780 --> 00:18:24.220]   Peter's response, "You are thus the Christ, the son of the living God."
[00:18:24.220 --> 00:18:27.500]   And so the question isn't, "What do my pastors believe?
[00:18:27.500 --> 00:18:28.700]   What does the church believe?
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:31.940]   What does my denomination believe?"
[00:18:31.940 --> 00:18:33.340]   What do you believe?
[00:18:33.340 --> 00:18:37.180]   Is he truly your refuge?
[00:18:37.180 --> 00:18:43.540]   I remember hearing Chuck Smith, obviously the founder of Calvary Chapel, and he probably
[00:18:43.540 --> 00:18:49.540]   had one of the biggest spiritual influences, that God used him to bring the Jesus movement
[00:18:49.540 --> 00:18:51.500]   in the 1970s.
[00:18:51.500 --> 00:18:58.580]   And he gives a testimony about how, in the earlier part of the church, how he really
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:01.060]   felt like that this is a church that he needed to build.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:06.360]   And he started a project to build this church, but they eventually ran out of money.
[00:19:06.360 --> 00:19:09.380]   And he was praying, and they had a certain bill that was coming up, and he was praying
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:13.040]   to God, and he was getting anxious and anxious as the time was coming.
[00:19:13.040 --> 00:19:20.100]   And all of a sudden, he says, a member, somebody he didn't know that well, called him and said,
[00:19:20.100 --> 00:19:22.780]   "Pastor, God really convicted me to give you an offering."
[00:19:22.780 --> 00:19:26.380]   And then he said, "I'm going to be sending you a check."
[00:19:26.380 --> 00:19:31.740]   And when he said the amount, he said he was floored, because that was exactly the amount
[00:19:31.740 --> 00:19:36.000]   of money that he needed to get to the next stage.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:41.580]   And he said that he was rejoicing and thanking God for answering his prayer, and he was so
[00:19:41.580 --> 00:19:46.180]   happy about that phone call.
[00:19:46.180 --> 00:19:52.700]   But then he says afterwards, he felt a strong rebuke in his heart, because he says, again,
[00:19:52.700 --> 00:19:59.440]   in his testimony, he said, "He rejoiced more over the promise of that man over the phone
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:03.900]   than the promise that God gave him, that if you seek his kingdom and all his righteousness,
[00:20:03.900 --> 00:20:07.340]   all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:13.620]   And he shares in his testimony how it revealed in his heart that he trusted more from what
[00:20:13.620 --> 00:20:19.200]   that man said on the phone than what his father says in his word.
[00:20:19.200 --> 00:20:25.300]   And so he shares how God revealed early on in ministry, how even in the context of doing
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:32.060]   God's work, where we use our own effort and our confidence comes from man, if we're not
[00:20:32.060 --> 00:20:33.060]   careful.
[00:20:33.060 --> 00:20:34.700]   And so that's the first understanding of the word.
[00:20:34.700 --> 00:20:36.000]   Are we dwelling in Christ?
[00:20:36.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Is he our refuge?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.060]   Is he the one that we run to?
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:41.940]   Second meaning, to remain.
[00:20:41.940 --> 00:20:46.500]   The word to remain means to continue, to keep going.
[00:20:46.500 --> 00:20:51.620]   And again, this was given to the disciples because Jesus was leaving, he's going to be
[00:20:51.620 --> 00:20:57.580]   crucified, and he also knew that the disciples were going to be scared, and that the leaders
[00:20:57.580 --> 00:21:01.780]   of Israel, just like they came after Jesus, they're going to come after them.
[00:21:01.780 --> 00:21:06.940]   So he's telling them that when this happens, Peter, when you deny me three times and you're
[00:21:06.940 --> 00:21:14.820]   in fear hiding from these people, when you come back to your senses, remember, the safest
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:20.420]   place for you to be is to continue with me, to remain.
[00:21:20.420 --> 00:21:25.500]   Even if it seems like this is crazy, that if we continue with Jesus, we may actually
[00:21:25.500 --> 00:21:27.540]   go to the cross.
[00:21:27.540 --> 00:21:30.980]   And they were probably thinking, they probably remember Jesus said, "If you want to come
[00:21:30.980 --> 00:21:33.020]   after me, you must pick up the cross."
[00:21:33.020 --> 00:21:36.860]   And maybe they kind of heard it metaphorically because they didn't understand.
[00:21:36.860 --> 00:21:41.080]   Even when Jesus says, "I'm going to the cross," they didn't understand.
[00:21:41.080 --> 00:21:45.380]   So maybe when they heard it, they kind of said, "Oh, maybe he meant sacrifice."
[00:21:45.380 --> 00:21:48.140]   Kind of a lot of the way that we take it, right?
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:54.260]   It means to live, persevere through persecution or make difficult decisions.
[00:21:54.260 --> 00:21:58.940]   But when Jesus actually went to the cross, I bet you it was kind of going off on their
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:02.700]   heads like, "Oh my gosh, he actually meant it.
[00:22:02.700 --> 00:22:06.780]   He literally meant he's going to die and you need to die.
[00:22:06.780 --> 00:22:10.260]   He actually meant it physically.
[00:22:10.260 --> 00:22:13.120]   That's exactly what he meant to his disciples.
[00:22:13.120 --> 00:22:16.780]   If you want to come after me, you need to deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow
[00:22:16.780 --> 00:22:17.860]   me."
[00:22:17.860 --> 00:22:21.820]   And so he's telling his disciples, when that temptation comes, if I continue to go down
[00:22:21.820 --> 00:22:25.060]   this path, there's uncertainty.
[00:22:25.060 --> 00:22:26.980]   There's death, persecution.
[00:22:26.980 --> 00:22:29.100]   I may lose my job.
[00:22:29.100 --> 00:22:31.300]   I may not be able to pay my bills.
[00:22:31.300 --> 00:22:33.860]   I may not be able to continue to go down this path.
[00:22:33.860 --> 00:22:39.340]   And you have people, maybe even other Christians, who are trying to dissuade you from picking
[00:22:39.340 --> 00:22:41.460]   up your cross.
[00:22:41.460 --> 00:22:45.900]   And Jesus reminded his disciples, he says, "No, you continue.
[00:22:45.900 --> 00:22:46.900]   You continue.
[00:22:46.900 --> 00:22:47.900]   You continue to remain."
[00:22:47.900 --> 00:22:55.640]   You know, 1 John 2, verse 19, John says in his other letter, "They went out from us,
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:22:57.700]   but they were not of us.
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:23:00.540]   For if they had been of us, they would have continued with us.
[00:23:00.540 --> 00:23:06.540]   For they went out that it may become plain that they all are not of us."
[00:23:06.540 --> 00:23:10.920]   Now when John was writing this epistle, 1 John, he was talking to a different group
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:16.660]   of people because significant time has already passed from the time of Jesus' death and resurrection.
[00:23:16.660 --> 00:23:25.220]   But I bet that Apostle John never forgot about Judas because what he says here is exactly
[00:23:25.220 --> 00:23:29.320]   what Jesus said about Judas before he went, he gets to chapter 15.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:33.040]   He warned them, "Judas is going to leave us.
[00:23:33.040 --> 00:23:34.780]   He's going to betray me."
[00:23:34.780 --> 00:23:37.080]   And he's saying, "You released him to go."
[00:23:37.080 --> 00:23:41.460]   And so John is saying it's because he did not continue.
[00:23:41.460 --> 00:23:43.660]   If he was really of us, he would have continued.
[00:23:43.660 --> 00:23:46.460]   He would have remained with Christ.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:51.600]   And so now he reminds us of what Jesus said to them.
[00:23:51.600 --> 00:23:54.700]   If you want to continue, you must remain.
[00:23:54.700 --> 00:23:57.980]   But what does it mean to remain in Christ?
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:01.500]   Well Hebrews chapter 3, 6, you know we're going to be jumping back into Hebrews pretty
[00:24:01.500 --> 00:24:02.500]   soon.
[00:24:02.500 --> 00:24:04.940]   I'm not going to guarantee it's going to be next week but possibly the week after for
[00:24:04.940 --> 00:24:06.380]   sure.
[00:24:06.380 --> 00:24:09.700]   But we've been studying through the book of Hebrews and the whole book of Hebrews is a
[00:24:09.700 --> 00:24:13.840]   warning and encouragement to not to drift.
[00:24:13.840 --> 00:24:18.820]   So you will see that idea repeated over and over again all throughout the book of Hebrews
[00:24:18.820 --> 00:24:24.820]   because the central theme, central thing that he's warning the recipients of this letter
[00:24:24.820 --> 00:24:26.300]   is not to drift.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:31.660]   That's why he says over and over again, Hebrews 3, 6, "And we are his house if indeed we hold
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:36.160]   fast our confidence and our boasting in our hope."
[00:24:36.160 --> 00:24:39.060]   You know why he's telling them to hold fast?
[00:24:39.060 --> 00:24:42.100]   It's because they were holding on loosely.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.420]   They weren't rejecting Christ.
[00:24:43.420 --> 00:24:45.560]   They weren't pursuing idolatry.
[00:24:45.560 --> 00:24:48.960]   It's just that you know when it was a little bit too hard to go this path they would kind
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:51.360]   of you know go the easier path.
[00:24:51.360 --> 00:24:55.920]   If it was too difficult to say this and they kind of toned it down said the other way.
[00:24:55.920 --> 00:25:01.240]   You know a lot of the ways that we avoid hardship in our lives is not to completely reject it.
[00:25:01.240 --> 00:25:03.680]   We just kind of tone it down a little bit.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:05.080]   Don't be crazy.
[00:25:05.080 --> 00:25:06.080]   Don't say it like that.
[00:25:06.080 --> 00:25:09.120]   You can preach the gospel but don't say that.
[00:25:09.120 --> 00:25:12.640]   You can tell them about the love of Christ but don't talk about hell.
[00:25:12.640 --> 00:25:16.040]   You could talk about Jesus being the only way but don't say he's the only way and all
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:18.800]   the other ways are wrong.
[00:25:18.800 --> 00:25:25.000]   So we kind of tone it down a little bit you know and we find we try to make the path that
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.880]   we're on as easy as possible.
[00:25:27.880 --> 00:25:34.880]   When he says to hold on, hold fast, is that these truths that you are convicted about
[00:25:34.880 --> 00:25:38.480]   that you don't compromise, that you hold on to dear life.
[00:25:38.480 --> 00:25:44.960]   Hebrews 3.14, for we share in Christ if indeed we hold our original confidence firm to the
[00:25:44.960 --> 00:25:46.760]   end.
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:50.920]   That the things that we were convicted about when he opened our eyes to see the glory of
[00:25:50.920 --> 00:25:57.520]   the gospel of Jesus Christ that ten years later that you've become compromised and you've
[00:25:57.520 --> 00:25:58.520]   drifted.
[00:25:58.520 --> 00:26:03.000]   Hebrews 4.14, since then we have a great high priest who has passed through the heavens,
[00:26:03.000 --> 00:26:04.200]   Jesus the son of God.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:07.760]   Let us hold fast our confession.
[00:26:07.760 --> 00:26:12.640]   Hold fast, not just kind of I got on the boat so we're safe you know.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:20.800]   A lot of confessing Christians are more than perfectly satisfied that they made a good
[00:26:20.800 --> 00:26:27.760]   decision sometime way back in life and then now we're just kind of just I'm on the boat
[00:26:27.760 --> 00:26:31.880]   and wherever this boat takes me and so you know you're the captain so take the boat and
[00:26:31.880 --> 00:26:33.080]   I'm just on it.
[00:26:33.080 --> 00:26:38.000]   He said that was the danger of these people, the second, third generation Christians and
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:43.400]   even in the first century they were just beginning to drift and not holding fast.
[00:26:43.400 --> 00:26:49.320]   Hebrews 6.11, and we desire that each one of you show the same diligence so as to realize
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:54.240]   the full assurance of hope until the end.
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:58.680]   You know again there's a lot of people who are absolutely certain of their faith in the
[00:26:58.680 --> 00:27:04.000]   beginning of their walk with God, five, ten, fifteen, twenty years later they have a lot
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:08.680]   of doubts that crept into their hearts and the reason why is because they weren't holding
[00:27:08.680 --> 00:27:10.360]   fast.
[00:27:10.360 --> 00:27:17.280]   They were drifting and once you are far, far away from Christ, the glory of Christ is just
[00:27:17.280 --> 00:27:18.280]   a memory.
[00:27:18.280 --> 00:27:23.120]   It is not a present thing that you are experiencing you know.
[00:27:23.120 --> 00:27:28.160]   It's something that you saw maybe years ago and you're always trying to look back and
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:31.520]   say oh I remember when he was like that, I remember when I was like that but it is not
[00:27:31.520 --> 00:27:34.200]   a current testimony.
[00:27:34.200 --> 00:27:40.680]   It's not your current state of mind meaning that we've drifted.
[00:27:40.680 --> 00:27:45.360]   So he says hold fast to show the same diligence to continue to remain.
[00:27:45.360 --> 00:27:50.920]   Hebrews 10.23, let us hold fast the confession of our hope without wavering for he who promised
[00:27:50.920 --> 00:27:51.920]   is faithful.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:54.160]   Hold fast because God does not change.
[00:27:54.160 --> 00:27:58.280]   Same Christ that we met when we first met him is the same Christ today.
[00:27:58.280 --> 00:28:02.640]   The same things that he desired of us when we first met him is the same Christ that desires
[00:28:02.640 --> 00:28:04.360]   the same thing of us today.
[00:28:04.360 --> 00:28:07.960]   He says to hold fast.
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:13.160]   You know years ago I had a friend who was getting married and again this is many, many
[00:28:13.160 --> 00:28:19.320]   years ago and we decided to take him to white water rafting.
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:23.700]   And so I've never been white water rafting so we thought it would be fun and they made
[00:28:23.700 --> 00:28:28.520]   us sign a waiver saying that you can drown, you can die, you know you can all this stuff
[00:28:28.520 --> 00:28:31.760]   and it's like how dangerous could it be?
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:37.520]   I know that we don't normally sign these waivers that we may get hurt or die and that it's
[00:28:37.520 --> 00:28:43.320]   not your responsibility and it's kind of nerve wracking to get into a boat, a tiny little
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:48.880]   raft but we think if they do this for a living so it can't be too bad.
[00:28:48.880 --> 00:28:53.320]   But what we didn't realize was right before we got into that boat El Nino happened like
[00:28:53.320 --> 00:28:59.400]   a month before and so there was a lot of water that wasn't normal that even the instructors
[00:28:59.400 --> 00:29:01.280]   were not used to.
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:07.080]   And so we got into the boat and we were going down the raft and it was crazy to begin with
[00:29:07.080 --> 00:29:10.880]   and I remember the thought that I had was I can't believe they're letting beginners
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:16.960]   onto this raft because we had pictures where we're literally in the water and all you see
[00:29:16.960 --> 00:29:20.840]   is water around us because the raft was bent in half you know.
[00:29:20.840 --> 00:29:26.080]   And so we were about an hour into it and we pulled over to take a break and we were all
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:32.320]   of us who were there to have fun we were a bit terrified you know and we were asking
[00:29:32.320 --> 00:29:36.680]   ourselves this is for beginners?
[00:29:36.680 --> 00:29:39.880]   And then that's when they explained to us oh yeah this is not normal usually it's pretty
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:46.280]   calm and there's a couple places where it gets kind of hairy but because of El Nino
[00:29:46.280 --> 00:29:50.760]   the whole place is like that and so you really need to pay attention.
[00:29:50.760 --> 00:29:54.600]   Well after we took a break we got back onto the raft and then we turned a corner and it
[00:29:54.600 --> 00:30:00.680]   was a huge rapid and we hit it so hard one of the guys who was sitting next to me he
[00:30:00.680 --> 00:30:05.040]   flew and he ended up hitting the instructor on the forehead and he ended up breaking his
[00:30:05.040 --> 00:30:09.920]   nose and then the instructor had stitches so we had to pull over and he had to be taken
[00:30:09.920 --> 00:30:14.200]   to the hospital and then the instructor had to be changed.
[00:30:14.200 --> 00:30:19.080]   But they didn't cancel the raft they got a new instructor coming in and so by that time
[00:30:19.080 --> 00:30:24.280]   we're freaking out you know I was thinking like you know this is before we had kids that
[00:30:24.280 --> 00:30:27.400]   oh I'm going to bring Esther here you know we're going to have fun doing this but after
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:30.760]   that I said no I'm not bringing Esther here this is not safe right?
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:36.240]   We get back into the boat we have about another 30 minutes and it was just as hairy but by
[00:30:36.240 --> 00:30:41.480]   then we are like full alert right?
[00:30:41.480 --> 00:30:46.160]   But most of the day has gone by we're kind of at the tail end and so we think you know
[00:30:46.160 --> 00:30:49.000]   we have maybe about 20 more minutes of this and then we're going to be pulled over and
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.560]   I said man this was crazy but right before we make this turn our instructor pulls us
[00:30:54.560 --> 00:30:59.620]   over for no other reason it wasn't a time for break it wasn't a lunch time but no other
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.760]   reason other than to get us ready right?
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.080]   And she said everything that you've experienced up to this point was pretty elementary compared
[00:31:09.080 --> 00:31:13.880]   to what's coming and we were we were like what?
[00:31:13.880 --> 00:31:17.400]   Our instructor had to be changed because she had stitches one of our friends broke his
[00:31:17.400 --> 00:31:22.080]   nose so he had to get out of the boat and you're saying that that compared to what's
[00:31:22.080 --> 00:31:27.080]   coming you know it was pretty easy so I mean we're starting to get scared what's around
[00:31:27.080 --> 00:31:33.800]   this corner and I could tell the instructor himself was starting to get anxious so that
[00:31:33.800 --> 00:31:37.600]   freaked us out even more what's around this corner that this guy does this for a living
[00:31:37.600 --> 00:31:43.200]   and he's like there's some fear in his eyes so he said when we turn this corner we hit
[00:31:43.200 --> 00:31:47.440]   this raft the waters are going to be pretty high and once we get into it there's no way
[00:31:47.440 --> 00:31:54.120]   to pull over so if you fall into the water typically their plan is they're going to throw
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:58.560]   a line and they're going to try to pull you back in or the next boat that comes will come
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:04.800]   and grab you and bring you back in but he said when we get into this it's going to be
[00:32:04.800 --> 00:32:09.560]   so rough if you fall into the water we're not going to be able to get you you're going
[00:32:09.560 --> 00:32:13.920]   to have to ride this out you know and you're going to end up drinking some water and we'll
[00:32:13.920 --> 00:32:17.040]   see you at the end when it comes calm then we'll bring you back into the water so in
[00:32:17.040 --> 00:32:23.240]   other words don't fall in right and he said the only way that you're going to we're going
[00:32:23.240 --> 00:32:29.080]   to be okay is if you do exactly what I tell you and when I tell you to throw the oar into
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:33.520]   the water you guys do it because the only leverage that we have like you know again
[00:32:33.520 --> 00:32:38.360]   I need this this has become longer than I originally planned but he said that on the
[00:32:38.360 --> 00:32:42.280]   raft if you've ever gone white water rafting they don't have anything to bind you into
[00:32:42.280 --> 00:32:46.240]   this boat just in case the boat flips and you're going to drown so the only way that
[00:32:46.240 --> 00:32:49.440]   you have any kind of leverage is through the oar into the water and that's the only way
[00:32:49.440 --> 00:32:55.920]   you can grab onto it so he said when I tell you to dig you just dig and you stay in right
[00:32:55.920 --> 00:33:01.240]   so we are all hyped up we're ready to go and we turned a corner and the water was so high
[00:33:01.240 --> 00:33:06.120]   we couldn't see on the other side of that so we're freaking out she's freaking I mean
[00:33:06.120 --> 00:33:10.480]   the our instructor is freaking out we're going okay okay we're ready and right before we
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:20.040]   hit the raft well the water one of our friends we turn around just slips into the water so
[00:33:20.040 --> 00:33:23.640]   we're looking at each other like oh my god we didn't we're not in the water yet so do
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:26.680]   we bring him back in so we're looking at each other we're looking at the instructor what
[00:33:26.680 --> 00:33:31.320]   should we do but as we're looking at each other we're headed to this water so you can
[00:33:31.320 --> 00:33:37.320]   tell she's kind of hesitating and then she says forget him because if we try to bring
[00:33:37.320 --> 00:33:43.920]   him in and we hit the raft we're all going to go in she said let him be and get dig yourself
[00:33:43.920 --> 00:33:48.360]   into the water right so as soon as he said that we were ready and we were ready to turn
[00:33:48.360 --> 00:33:52.960]   around we hit we hit the water and when we hit the water the went our boat went completely
[00:33:52.960 --> 00:33:59.720]   vertical and so half of our friends went into the water I happen to be in the very top and
[00:33:59.720 --> 00:34:04.600]   I just yanked in I hugged hugged the water with my oar and that's how I was able to stay
[00:34:04.600 --> 00:34:09.760]   in but once we got into it she I mean he was right we couldn't bring them back in we were
[00:34:09.760 --> 00:34:16.680]   so busy just us trying to stay in the water we had no way to bring them back in okay again
[00:34:16.680 --> 00:34:21.280]   there's this story goes on and on right so they they were in the water the next raft
[00:34:21.280 --> 00:34:25.640]   that was coming behind they couldn't pay any attention so they for about I forgot me it
[00:34:25.640 --> 00:34:29.360]   felt like a good minute that we were going down this raft and and we couldn't pull them
[00:34:29.360 --> 00:34:32.280]   back into the water until we were done we couldn't even see where they were because
[00:34:32.280 --> 00:34:37.120]   the raft was so high right the reason why I share this story is because all of this
[00:34:37.120 --> 00:34:42.800]   is related to what Jesus is saying to his disciples so whatever hardship that you felt
[00:34:42.800 --> 00:34:48.680]   up to this point whatever trouble or anxiousness or fear that you felt I'm about to I'm about
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:54.800]   to go to the cross there's real danger for your life that's coming around this corner
[00:34:54.800 --> 00:35:00.120]   and if you don't pay attention to what I say if you don't remain in me you're not going
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:06.760]   to make it so as much as this is an instruction of how to bear fruit he's telling them that
[00:35:06.760 --> 00:35:15.920]   this only way that you're going to survive is if you continue to remain in me the biggest
[00:35:15.920 --> 00:35:21.800]   danger of where you and I are is not burnout is not burnout you know we use that word so
[00:35:21.800 --> 00:35:25.600]   commonly when you get tired and I don't want to teach anymore I don't want to serve anymore
[00:35:25.600 --> 00:35:32.320]   I don't want to do this anymore you say I'm burned out the biggest problem where we you
[00:35:32.320 --> 00:35:38.800]   and I live is not burnout it's being rusted out from lack of work from lack of diligence
[00:35:38.800 --> 00:35:43.840]   for lack of exercising our spiritual muscles lack of holding fast the confession that we
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:50.320]   had at first and so we get busy like everybody else does not necessarily like we're deep
[00:35:50.320 --> 00:35:56.480]   into sin but just busy with life just like everybody else the next thing we know we're
[00:35:56.480 --> 00:36:03.080]   not we're not grounded we're not anchored in Christ but you don't need to be anchored
[00:36:03.080 --> 00:36:07.840]   when there's no storm you don't need to be anchored when the waves are calm because you
[00:36:07.840 --> 00:36:14.000]   kind of sit there you know and you're not you don't feel any real danger then all of
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:18.360]   a sudden the storm comes and you lift your eyes and you realize you're nowhere near the
[00:36:18.360 --> 00:36:25.440]   shore see if we're not anchored in Christ we don't feel a sense of urgency until something
[00:36:25.440 --> 00:36:32.800]   happens COVID-19 happens the world gets shut down there's real fear and then persecution
[00:36:32.800 --> 00:36:39.840]   comes I don't know about you but the spiritual environment that we are in now versus even
[00:36:39.840 --> 00:36:45.600]   just 30 or 40 years ago it's night and day the hostility that is coming from even government
[00:36:45.600 --> 00:36:50.480]   officials toward Christianity and churches have grown exponentially just in the last
[00:36:50.480 --> 00:36:59.800]   10 years persecution if it's not already here it's coming and we don't realize how far we
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:07.000]   are until the storm comes see Jesus was telling them Jesus is telling them it's coming be
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:11.780]   ready and the only way that you're going to survive is if you hold fast you know what's
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:18.560]   really interesting I was looking up to see you know in BBC in England they did a study
[00:37:18.560 --> 00:37:25.120]   in Europe to see how many people die simply from lack of activity they said every year
[00:37:25.120 --> 00:37:34.280]   676,000 people die from lack of activity lack of activity that is related to heart disease
[00:37:34.280 --> 00:37:39.680]   right diabetes whatever it is that come from lack of active just being sedentary life he
[00:37:39.680 --> 00:37:46.080]   said 676,000 people die from that every year and this is just a study from BBC of Europe
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:50.360]   so if you multiply that all throughout the world it's got a minimum at least double that
[00:37:50.360 --> 00:37:56.160]   number so over a million people die from lack of activity right now we're living in fear
[00:37:56.160 --> 00:38:01.800]   because of COVID-19 legitimately this is a dangerous disease that we need to be careful
[00:38:01.800 --> 00:38:09.340]   about but 311,000 people around the whole world has died because of this see the greatest
[00:38:09.340 --> 00:38:16.640]   danger in our world usually are not things that you can see clearly usually the things
[00:38:16.640 --> 00:38:23.240]   that destroy us and is most dangerous are things that we are not aware of that we just
[00:38:23.240 --> 00:38:26.880]   kind of are relaxed and just kind of let it flow and just kind of drift the next thing
[00:38:26.880 --> 00:38:32.440]   you know when the storm comes you're not anchored and the boat flips and you drown that's why
[00:38:32.440 --> 00:38:36.960]   when it is in times of peace when we don't feel the sense of urgency is when we need
[00:38:36.960 --> 00:38:47.420]   to hold fast and that's what Jesus is saying remain remain and continue third and finally
[00:38:47.420 --> 00:38:53.480]   it means to depend if we dwell on all of these ideas are connected but again the specific
[00:38:53.480 --> 00:39:02.840]   nuance of this is to dwell with him to continue with him and to ultimately depend on him whenever
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:07.840]   we face troubles or trials whether it's financial or spiritual our natural tendencies to rely
[00:39:07.840 --> 00:39:15.240]   on man whether it's other men or ourselves let's strategize let's have a meeting let's
[00:39:15.240 --> 00:39:20.200]   identify what the problem is let's implement some new ideas let's organize a little bit
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:24.680]   differently let's get some right people in the right place to do the right things and
[00:39:24.680 --> 00:39:30.560]   if we do it right it'll fix the problem that's usually our tendency when Jesus says if you
[00:39:30.560 --> 00:39:40.080]   don't abide in me you cannot bear fruit human problems may be fixed with human ingenuity
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:43.960]   but the warfare that you are and I are in is not against flesh and blood he makes it
[00:39:43.960 --> 00:39:49.200]   very clear it is a spiritual battle so the only way that you and I can have success in
[00:39:49.200 --> 00:39:56.600]   a spiritual battle is to engage spiritually and so he says you must depend on me you must
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:40:02.880]   depend on me before we strategize before we implement before we get the right people in
[00:40:02.880 --> 00:40:10.320]   the right place to do the right thing do we come to Christ is he our ultimate answer see
[00:40:10.320 --> 00:40:15.480]   in Colossians chapter 129 Paul describes his ministry this way for this purpose I also
[00:40:15.480 --> 00:40:23.680]   I labor and strive right now if you stop right there Paul was a hard worker he persevered
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:29.120]   he was whooped he was shipwrecked you know and yet he personally he is a man who was
[00:40:29.120 --> 00:40:35.280]   so committed we need to be committed which is all true but if you miss what the second
[00:40:35.280 --> 00:40:41.600]   part of what he says you can completely pervert what he's trying to say for this purpose also
[00:40:41.600 --> 00:40:49.580]   I labor striving according to his power which mightily works within me Paul is saying he's
[00:40:49.580 --> 00:40:56.920]   able to do what he's doing because Christ is already working in him because you cannot
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:41:02.480]   bear fruit unless we are abiding in him Paul is able to do what he is doing because God
[00:41:02.480 --> 00:41:10.920]   is doing what he is doing with him ministry and preaching leading small groups sharing
[00:41:10.920 --> 00:41:16.920]   the gospel even just living our Christian life isn't simply applying and regurgitating
[00:41:16.920 --> 00:41:23.200]   things that we heard you know I can give a sermon and I could whatever the sermon is
[00:41:23.200 --> 00:41:28.520]   you say oh I really like that I was really challenged by that and then that's where it
[00:41:28.520 --> 00:41:36.000]   ends that's where it ends you heard something new it made you think but it has no power
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:43.180]   to change you it has no power to bear fruit because true fruit comes from true connection
[00:41:43.180 --> 00:41:50.120]   to the true vine Paul says even as he is striving he says I'm able to strive because of the
[00:41:50.120 --> 00:41:55.960]   work that he's doing in me Philippians 2 12 to 13 so then my beloved just as you have
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:01.440]   always obeyed not as in my presence only but now much more in my absence work out your
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:08.380]   salvation we're with fear and trembling again Paul says you need to not only am I striving
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:14.060]   but you need to work out your salvation with fear and trembling and I get so many questions
[00:42:14.060 --> 00:42:18.700]   about that what does it mean to work out your salvation what does it mean to have fear and
[00:42:18.700 --> 00:42:24.660]   trembling am I supposed to live day to day in fear of God's judgment am I supposed to
[00:42:24.660 --> 00:42:32.520]   strive and like like really work it out that's that sounds really burdensome you know especially
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:37.460]   if you've been walking with God for a while and you're you're faithfully attending Bible
[00:42:37.460 --> 00:42:42.560]   study and you're sacrificing you're giving and you're doing what you're supposed to do
[00:42:42.560 --> 00:42:46.540]   and then he says work out your salvation with fear and trembling am I supposed to like look
[00:42:46.540 --> 00:42:52.800]   at his judgment and live in what does that mean again if you don't if you again when
[00:42:52.800 --> 00:42:57.180]   you study the Bible if you don't study it in the context of everything that he's saying
[00:42:57.180 --> 00:43:01.380]   you can easily pervert the meaning of what he's saying right work out your salvation
[00:43:01.380 --> 00:43:07.860]   with fear and trembling verse 13 he says for it is God who works work for it is God who
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:14.720]   is at work in you both to will and to work for his good pleasure you notice how he says
[00:43:14.720 --> 00:43:19.680]   work at your salvation with fear and trembling because the reason why you're able to do that
[00:43:19.680 --> 00:43:27.300]   is because God is working in you God is already working in you for his own good pleasure in
[00:43:27.300 --> 00:43:31.300]   other words he's not telling you something like you know get your act together and do
[00:43:31.300 --> 00:43:36.660]   the right thing he says no he said allow the Holy Spirit to continue to do what he was
[00:43:36.660 --> 00:43:42.240]   given to do don't quench the Holy Spirit that's why Ephesians 5 18 is it be filled with the
[00:43:42.240 --> 00:43:47.620]   Holy Spirit right do not be drunk with wine but be filled with the Holy Spirit now why
[00:43:47.620 --> 00:43:53.580]   does he compare being drunk with being filled with the Holy Spirit he said do not be drunk
[00:43:53.580 --> 00:43:58.340]   with wine instead be filled with the Holy Spirit so he's making a correlation between
[00:43:58.340 --> 00:44:04.520]   these two ideas because being drunk right I have no idea what that feels like right
[00:44:04.520 --> 00:44:10.560]   some of you guys do if you're if you've ever been drunk right from what I've been told
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:16.620]   you can believe you're not yourself right the alcohol gets into your system and you
[00:44:16.620 --> 00:44:20.580]   say things and do things that you wouldn't normally in other words the alcohol controls
[00:44:20.580 --> 00:44:26.140]   you and it's not oh that's not him no it's it's you it's but it's the alcohol in you
[00:44:26.140 --> 00:44:31.260]   influencing you and you can somebody who's normally quiet can become very loud somebody
[00:44:31.260 --> 00:44:34.820]   who's very loud become very quiet somebody who doesn't normally share all of a sudden
[00:44:34.820 --> 00:44:39.660]   they share all these things and that's why a lot of social settings people drink first
[00:44:39.660 --> 00:44:46.380]   so that they can be loose there's a reason why he's comparing do not be drunk with wine
[00:44:46.380 --> 00:44:51.700]   and he's not just talking about wine anything else outside of the influence of the Holy
[00:44:51.700 --> 00:44:58.700]   Spirit is like being drunk with wine if you are influenced by the world and world's ideologies
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:03.740]   and principles if you are chasing after money and the lust of money if you're chasing after
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:12.140]   influence if you're chasing after acknowledgement whatever it is that is not God it's like being
[00:45:12.140 --> 00:45:18.460]   drunk with wine and the wine is influencing your thoughts it's influencing what is right
[00:45:18.460 --> 00:45:24.180]   influencing your words he says do not be drunk with wine but be filled with the Holy Spirit
[00:45:24.180 --> 00:45:32.640]   you know what's interesting about being filled the word filled pleuru is in the present passive
[00:45:32.640 --> 00:45:39.500]   imperative what's interesting about that imperative means it's a command right so he says sit
[00:45:39.500 --> 00:45:45.820]   down it means you take your body and you put it onto the chair sit down but it's in the
[00:45:45.820 --> 00:45:55.660]   passive voice passive voice basically means to let yourself you receive the action so
[00:45:55.660 --> 00:46:00.020]   oftentimes when you hear the word imperative you would think he's telling you to do you
[00:46:00.020 --> 00:46:06.660]   actively do something but because it's in the passive voice he's saying you actively
[00:46:06.660 --> 00:46:13.500]   receive the action of the Holy Spirit that's what that means right in other words to sum
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:18.540]   it up he's saying that the Holy Spirit has already been given you so that you would not
[00:46:18.540 --> 00:46:27.140]   be an orphan he made his indwelling in you he was given to you as a seal as a guarantee
[00:46:27.140 --> 00:46:32.920]   as a deposit guaranteeing your salvation and then he said the Holy Spirit was given to
[00:46:32.920 --> 00:46:38.780]   you so that he may intercede and groan with words that you cannot understand so that he
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:43.920]   may continue to intercede on your behalf so the Holy Spirit is actively working in you
[00:46:43.920 --> 00:46:49.040]   there is no Christian where the Holy Spirit isn't working if the Holy Spirit is not indwelling
[00:46:49.040 --> 00:46:55.760]   in you you are not a Christian so when he says to be filled present passive imperative
[00:46:55.760 --> 00:47:01.420]   he's saying live in such a way that the Holy Spirit can take full control over your life
[00:47:01.420 --> 00:47:06.300]   that's what that means it's not to like okay raise your hand a certain way or if you sing
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:11.280]   louder or if you sing you know more emotional music or if you do certain things the Holy
[00:47:11.280 --> 00:47:15.260]   Spirit is going to come and fill you from top to bottom he says no the Holy Spirit is
[00:47:15.260 --> 00:47:23.080]   already working don't resist and that's why the Bible talks about not to quench the Spirit
[00:47:23.080 --> 00:47:29.400]   not to quench the Spirit in other words the Holy Spirit is already working in you do not
[00:47:29.400 --> 00:47:34.880]   do and go and do certain things that the Holy Spirit is being resisted and it's in the present
[00:47:34.880 --> 00:47:39.640]   tense meaning to continue it is not something that happens at justification alone but is
[00:47:39.640 --> 00:47:48.720]   an ongoing constant work of allowing the Holy Spirit to influence you that's why again to
[00:47:48.720 --> 00:47:56.060]   remain in Christ is to completely depend upon Christ that's why he says act 1 8 but you
[00:47:56.060 --> 00:48:04.440]   will receive power when the Holy Spirit comes upon you not when you have memorized enough
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:07.820]   scripture although all of these things are a good thing not because you know all the
[00:48:07.820 --> 00:48:13.060]   theology not because you had the proper training not because you're older and you have a lot
[00:48:13.060 --> 00:48:19.280]   of experience not because you read a lot of books he says the power is going to come upon
[00:48:19.280 --> 00:48:27.240]   you when the Holy Spirit comes upon you humanly speaking if we had if the task was given to
[00:48:27.240 --> 00:48:33.480]   us Jesus Christ was crucified he's resurrected and this is the most important message that
[00:48:33.480 --> 00:48:41.980]   the world will ever hear the consequence of the word not going out is people are going
[00:48:41.980 --> 00:48:49.140]   to go to hell people's destinies changes there's there's no greater task than the task that
[00:48:49.140 --> 00:48:53.600]   was given to the disciples but imagine if that task was given to us you know and saying
[00:48:53.600 --> 00:48:58.420]   hey you guys figure this out I Jesus says I've done my part now you guys figure this
[00:48:58.420 --> 00:49:05.340]   out right I would imagine there would be a great Bible conference that takes place with
[00:49:05.340 --> 00:49:11.100]   all the top theologians all the professors all the people who wrote the best systematic
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:16.540]   theology books all the people who have the largest churches they would get together and
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:22.660]   they would have a huge meeting how should we do this well we need to have the right
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:26.580]   people like who has the influence we have a senator who's among us maybe we can use
[00:49:26.580 --> 00:49:31.540]   him you know we have a multi-billionaire you know and we can use his influence and get
[00:49:31.540 --> 00:49:35.100]   his money to back our mission work and we would have all of these things and none of
[00:49:35.100 --> 00:49:45.020]   it in and of itself may be wrong see but Jesus was not asking the disciples to do that Jesus
[00:49:45.020 --> 00:49:50.940]   didn't call these fishermen tax collectors these guys were easily divided saying I want
[00:49:50.940 --> 00:49:56.060]   to be better than this guy these guys these guys are gonna fail you but but I won't they
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:50:01.380]   were not the cream of the crop they were not the most educated they were not the most influential
[00:50:01.380 --> 00:50:07.660]   in fact they just failed miserably the biggest test in their life and you're gonna instruct
[00:50:07.660 --> 00:50:13.740]   them to go make disciples come on now I know you're sovereign but clearly you don't see
[00:50:13.740 --> 00:50:23.060]   what we see he didn't entrust it to his disciples he did it he entrusted to the Holy Spirit
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:28.740]   through the disciples that's the difference because the point that Jesus was trying to
[00:50:28.740 --> 00:50:33.500]   make is the same point that God has been trying to make through history he can use donkeys
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:41.020]   if he wanted to when the Pharisees said hey stop them from yelling out Hosanna Hosanna
[00:50:41.020 --> 00:50:48.820]   he says if they don't yell out the rocks will cry out in other words the key is not
[00:50:48.820 --> 00:50:57.380]   in them that they would look at these untrained men on uneducated men and that when they see
[00:50:57.380 --> 00:51:01.220]   the power coming through them through their preaching and through their working that people
[00:51:01.220 --> 00:51:05.180]   may look at them and say these were uneducated men these were just fishermen but they were
[00:51:05.180 --> 00:51:13.140]   clearly with the Lord in other words they were clearly remaining in Christ they depend
[00:51:13.140 --> 00:51:18.060]   on Christ that's why he says before he sends him out wait because when the Holy Spirit
[00:51:18.060 --> 00:51:24.820]   comes upon you you will be my disciple you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem Judea Samaria
[00:51:24.820 --> 00:51:30.540]   to the remotest part of the world he doesn't say try hard he's when the Holy Spirit comes
[00:51:30.540 --> 00:51:34.660]   this is going to happen so he wasn't entrusting it to them he was entrusting it to the Holy
[00:51:34.660 --> 00:51:43.780]   Spirit and he tells us to remain in the Spirit to continue in the Spirit again in Psalm 37
[00:51:43.780 --> 00:51:47.820]   for delight yourself in the Lord and he will give you the desires of your heart commit
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:54.260]   your way to the Lord trust also in him and he will do it he will do it he will bring
[00:51:54.260 --> 00:52:00.980]   forth your righteousness as a light and your judgment as the noon day so let me wrap up
[00:52:00.980 --> 00:52:07.140]   this morning with this at the end of all of this at the end of all these instructions
[00:52:07.140 --> 00:52:12.500]   about continuing the promise of the Holy Spirit and bearing fruit by remaining he says the
[00:52:12.500 --> 00:52:19.780]   reason why you need to do all of this John 15 7 if you abide in me and my words abide
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:28.460]   in you ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you when you are abiding in me right
[00:52:28.460 --> 00:52:33.540]   Christ says the reason why you're going to bear fruit is because you're going to be able
[00:52:33.540 --> 00:52:39.820]   to pray more effectively John 15 16 you did not choose me but I chose you and appointed
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:45.180]   you that you would go and bear fruit and that your fruit will remain so that whatever you
[00:52:45.180 --> 00:52:49.900]   ask of the Father in my name he may give to you in other words why do you need to bear
[00:52:49.900 --> 00:52:57.380]   fruit so that you may be able to pray more effectively again finally John 16 23 to 24
[00:52:57.380 --> 00:53:01.260]   and that day you will not question me about anything truly truly I say to you if you ask
[00:53:01.260 --> 00:53:07.500]   the Father for anything in my name he will give it to you until now you have asked for
[00:53:07.500 --> 00:53:14.900]   nothing in my name ask and you will receive so that your joy may be made full in other
[00:53:14.900 --> 00:53:24.500]   words the primary gift that God has given us for the purpose of bearing fruit is himself
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:30.500]   and the benefit of bearing fruit and abiding in him is that we may have effective prayer
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:38.780]   have more of him right isn't that crazy and that's why he says in verse 2 right in verse
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:42.880]   2 he says every branch in me that does not bear fruit he takes away in every branch that
[00:53:42.880 --> 00:53:47.940]   bears fruit he prunes that so that it may bear more fruit so you notice here he says
[00:53:47.940 --> 00:53:53.600]   bear fruit that you may bear more fruit that ultimately you may bear much fruit and that's
[00:53:53.600 --> 00:54:02.900]   exactly how a living plant is described the fourth seed that he multiplies his fruit 30
[00:54:02.900 --> 00:54:10.060]   60 a hundredfold how much of our joy comes from knowing and experiencing this fruit in
[00:54:10.060 --> 00:54:18.700]   our lives because we are we have learned the secret of being content is to remain in Christ
[00:54:18.700 --> 00:54:23.060]   think about all the things that we are concerned about today all the problems that we need
[00:54:23.060 --> 00:54:30.820]   to fix whether it's relational whether it's whether it's financial whatever it may be
[00:54:30.820 --> 00:54:37.220]   think about how easily we run to human means and thinking that you know we get that done
[00:54:37.220 --> 00:54:41.460]   then we can we can do some prayer but I don't have time to pray until I've done my part
[00:54:41.460 --> 00:54:48.800]   no he said you can't do your part until we first learn to abide in Christ so again my
[00:54:48.800 --> 00:54:54.660]   prayer is that this unique period of time that God has given us that before we run to
[00:54:54.660 --> 00:55:02.220]   anything else that we carefully examine where we're at are we truly remaining in Christ
[00:55:02.220 --> 00:55:07.980]   are we dwelling in Christ are we continuing in Christ and are we depending in Christ and
[00:55:07.980 --> 00:55:14.020]   I pray that as we pursue Christ with all our hearts that we may truly bear fruit 30 60
[00:55:14.020 --> 00:55:15.180]   a hundredfold let's pray
