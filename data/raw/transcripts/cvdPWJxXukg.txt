[00:01:08.600 --> 00:01:09.800]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:11.560]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:01:11.560 --> 00:01:12.680]   I'd like to begin our service
[00:01:12.680 --> 00:01:14.520]   by just reading a short passage
[00:01:14.520 --> 00:01:18.240]   from Romans 12, verses one and two.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:19.920]   "Therefore, I urge you, brethren,
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:21.520]   "by the mercies of God,
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.200]   "to present your bodies
[00:01:23.200 --> 00:01:26.200]   "a living and holy sacrifice acceptable to God,
[00:01:26.200 --> 00:01:30.020]   "which is your spiritual service of worship.
[00:01:30.020 --> 00:01:32.040]   "Do not be conformed to the spoiled,
[00:01:32.040 --> 00:01:34.740]   "but be transformed by the renewing of your mind,
[00:01:34.740 --> 00:01:36.980]   "so that you may prove what the will of God is,
[00:01:36.980 --> 00:01:39.760]   "that which is good and acceptable and perfect."

[00:05:47.180 --> 00:06:03.040]   - All right, good morning.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:06.980]   I'm still not used to the transition yet.
[00:06:06.980 --> 00:06:09.180]   You know, I go outside and drink a little coffee
[00:06:09.180 --> 00:06:11.660]   and it's already time to come back in.
[00:06:11.660 --> 00:06:15.900]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:06:15.900 --> 00:06:19.380]   First of all, our Jubilee ministry, if you're 50 and older,
[00:06:19.380 --> 00:06:20.900]   there's a lunch fellowship that's going on
[00:06:20.900 --> 00:06:24.380]   on February 2nd at 1 p.m., so that's, again,
[00:06:24.380 --> 00:06:27.320]   in a couple Sundays at 1 p.m. after the third service,
[00:06:27.320 --> 00:06:30.180]   there's gonna be a lunch fellowship to kick off the year.
[00:06:30.180 --> 00:06:32.660]   And along with that, the Jubilee ministry
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:35.620]   and the FIG ministry, which is the larger part
[00:06:35.620 --> 00:06:38.140]   of the family ministry, they are taking sign-ups
[00:06:38.140 --> 00:06:39.820]   for the Bible reading for the year.
[00:06:39.820 --> 00:06:41.340]   They're reading through the New Testament,
[00:06:41.340 --> 00:06:44.260]   just one chapter a day, and the purpose of this,
[00:06:44.260 --> 00:06:47.500]   again, obviously, is to keep each other accountable
[00:06:47.500 --> 00:06:50.020]   and have fellowship around a specific purpose
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:51.220]   of reading the Bible.
[00:06:51.220 --> 00:06:53.500]   So when the fellowship does happen,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.460]   whether it's in your groups or with the Jubilee group,
[00:06:56.460 --> 00:06:59.960]   that the conversations would not just be about,
[00:06:59.960 --> 00:07:01.180]   you know, just regular life,
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:02.820]   but about the things that they're reading.
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:05.680]   And so they're using that to encourage fellowship,
[00:07:05.680 --> 00:07:07.700]   like meaningful, purposeful fellowship.
[00:07:07.700 --> 00:07:09.340]   So if you wanna participate in that,
[00:07:09.340 --> 00:07:12.220]   please go ahead and sign up for that,
[00:07:12.220 --> 00:07:13.620]   for, again, for the Jubilee
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:16.020]   and for the rest of the family ministry as well.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:20.620]   And I think Intentional Sisters Fellowship,
[00:07:20.620 --> 00:07:21.940]   again, February to June,
[00:07:21.940 --> 00:07:23.180]   if you wanna participate in that,
[00:07:23.180 --> 00:07:26.100]   there's one going on Friday morning, Thursday morning,
[00:07:26.100 --> 00:07:27.900]   and then one at Monday night.
[00:07:27.900 --> 00:07:29.620]   There are various times so that you can pick
[00:07:29.620 --> 00:07:31.380]   which one is more convenient for you.
[00:07:31.380 --> 00:07:34.580]   Otherwise, let me give you a brief announcement again.
[00:07:34.580 --> 00:07:38.660]   We are transitioning from our Zelle to Subsplash.
[00:07:38.660 --> 00:07:41.480]   I know some of you guys are still paying checks
[00:07:41.480 --> 00:07:44.540]   and physical offering, that will still always be available,
[00:07:44.540 --> 00:07:48.020]   but we are having some issues with the bank about Zelle.
[00:07:48.020 --> 00:07:50.420]   And so we're gonna give some time.
[00:07:50.420 --> 00:07:53.020]   So if you've already signed up for Subsplash,
[00:07:53.020 --> 00:07:57.300]   we ask you to try to use the Subsplash for the online giving,
[00:07:57.300 --> 00:08:00.300]   but we ask you to do that as soon as you can,
[00:08:00.300 --> 00:08:02.580]   because you do need to register and sign up for that,
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:05.420]   in order for you to use that avenue to give.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.140]   But it'll help us tremendously
[00:08:07.140 --> 00:08:09.300]   if most of our church is using the Subsplash,
[00:08:09.300 --> 00:08:12.120]   because it's easier to keep track.
[00:08:12.120 --> 00:08:14.300]   We're having less and less problems with the bank.
[00:08:14.300 --> 00:08:16.200]   And so we know it's gonna take a little bit of time
[00:08:16.200 --> 00:08:18.440]   to get you guys on Subsplash.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.280]   Our first service,
[00:08:19.280 --> 00:08:21.620]   I heard that we had some issues with Subsplash.
[00:08:21.620 --> 00:08:23.780]   So if you're not signed up for it,
[00:08:23.780 --> 00:08:25.420]   the Zelle's gonna be open for a while
[00:08:25.420 --> 00:08:27.700]   until the majority of the church transition.
[00:08:27.700 --> 00:08:30.220]   But at some point, we may have to shut down Zelle.
[00:08:30.220 --> 00:08:31.900]   So we ask you to do that as soon as you can.
[00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:32.960]   So those of you who are members,
[00:08:32.960 --> 00:08:34.740]   we already shared this at the members meeting.
[00:08:34.740 --> 00:08:37.800]   Those of you who were not at the members meeting,
[00:08:37.800 --> 00:08:39.780]   this is where we're headed in the next few months.
[00:08:39.780 --> 00:08:41.460]   So please sign up for that.
[00:08:41.460 --> 00:08:43.300]   You go to the church app,
[00:08:43.300 --> 00:08:45.300]   and if you look way on the bottom on the right side,
[00:08:45.300 --> 00:08:46.140]   it says giving.
[00:08:46.140 --> 00:08:47.540]   And then if you click on that,
[00:08:47.540 --> 00:08:50.020]   it'll give you what you need to do to do that.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:51.560]   And then also on the church website,
[00:08:51.560 --> 00:08:53.100]   there's an avenue where you can go,
[00:08:53.100 --> 00:08:56.100]   and they'll be able to give you instructions
[00:08:56.100 --> 00:08:58.220]   and how to sign up for that, okay?
[00:08:58.220 --> 00:08:59.100]   So let me pray for us.
[00:08:59.100 --> 00:09:00.420]   And again, if you have a physical offering,
[00:09:00.420 --> 00:09:02.880]   there's a box in the back, offering box in the back.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:03.980]   All right, let's pray.
[00:09:04.500 --> 00:09:08.820]   Father, we pray for your grace
[00:09:08.820 --> 00:09:10.980]   to continue to lead and guide us,
[00:09:10.980 --> 00:09:13.300]   that even in our worship, Lord God,
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:16.900]   that we are dependent on you to stir in our hearts, Lord,
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:19.000]   a clear vision of Christ,
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:21.900]   that we may learn to worship you, honor you,
[00:09:21.900 --> 00:09:24.620]   obey you, Father God, and follow you.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:27.940]   May the offering that we give, that we give purposefully,
[00:09:27.940 --> 00:09:31.340]   help us, Lord God, as leaders to manage it with wisdom,
[00:09:31.340 --> 00:09:33.900]   according to the principles of your word,
[00:09:33.900 --> 00:09:36.260]   and may it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:38.860]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:38.860 --> 00:09:41.780]   (soft piano music)
[00:09:41.780 --> 00:09:44.700]   (soft piano music)
[00:09:44.700 --> 00:09:47.620]   (soft piano music)

[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:22.780]   Let us all rise.
[00:10:22.780 --> 00:10:24.700]   And before we continue our service,
[00:10:24.700 --> 00:10:25.840]   if we could spend a few moments
[00:10:25.840 --> 00:10:27.540]   to greet the neighbors around us.
[00:10:27.540 --> 00:10:32.480]   (congregation chattering)

[00:19:53.200 --> 00:19:56.480]   If you could turn your Bibles to Ephesians chapter six,
[00:19:56.480 --> 00:19:58.800]   verses 18 through 20.
[00:19:58.800 --> 00:20:01.520]   Ephesians chapter six, verse 18 to 20.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:10.440]   With all prayer and petition,
[00:20:10.440 --> 00:20:14.240]   pray at all times in the spirit and with this in view.
[00:20:14.240 --> 00:20:16.720]   Be on the alert with all perseverance and petition
[00:20:16.720 --> 00:20:19.640]   for all the saints and pray on my behalf
[00:20:19.640 --> 00:20:21.400]   that utterance may be given to me
[00:20:21.400 --> 00:20:23.040]   in the opening of my mouth
[00:20:23.040 --> 00:20:25.520]   to make known the boldness, the mystery of the gospel
[00:20:25.520 --> 00:20:28.080]   for which I am an ambassador in chains
[00:20:28.080 --> 00:20:29.360]   that in proclaiming it,
[00:20:29.360 --> 00:20:31.560]   I may speak boldly as I ought to speak.
[00:20:31.560 --> 00:20:32.400]   Let's pray.
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:36.200]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your Holy Spirit
[00:20:36.200 --> 00:20:38.280]   to lead and guide us.
[00:20:38.280 --> 00:20:40.480]   Help us, Lord God, to hear from you
[00:20:40.480 --> 00:20:43.280]   and not from anything else.
[00:20:43.280 --> 00:20:46.480]   Let your word go forth and not return
[00:20:46.480 --> 00:20:49.320]   until it has accomplished the purpose that you have ordained
[00:20:49.320 --> 00:20:51.040]   in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:20:52.040 --> 00:20:55.160]   - You know, there's certain things
[00:20:55.160 --> 00:20:57.320]   that we are engaged in in life
[00:20:57.320 --> 00:20:59.960]   that no matter how difficult it is,
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:03.560]   we have to persevere because we are clear
[00:21:03.560 --> 00:21:05.840]   that that is the right thing to do.
[00:21:05.840 --> 00:21:07.880]   And I think the first thing I can think of
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:09.440]   is if you're, again, if you're parents,
[00:21:09.440 --> 00:21:11.360]   if you're raising young children,
[00:21:11.360 --> 00:21:13.120]   no matter how difficult they are,
[00:21:13.120 --> 00:21:16.040]   no matter how disobedient they may be,
[00:21:16.040 --> 00:21:17.760]   you can't just throw up your hands and say,
[00:21:17.760 --> 00:21:20.240]   you know, it's so hard raising kids.
[00:21:20.240 --> 00:21:21.960]   And so they just don't listen.
[00:21:21.960 --> 00:21:23.280]   And then to raise your hand and say,
[00:21:23.280 --> 00:21:26.240]   you know, just do whatever you want and to give up.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:27.520]   You can't do that.
[00:21:27.520 --> 00:21:32.240]   Even if it takes years and years to raise the children
[00:21:32.240 --> 00:21:36.320]   and heartache and prayer, you know the consequence
[00:21:36.320 --> 00:21:40.120]   of not applying certain things in your life.
[00:21:40.120 --> 00:21:44.680]   That's true in many things, like whether that's your health.
[00:21:44.680 --> 00:21:46.080]   Like no matter how difficult it is,
[00:21:46.080 --> 00:21:47.680]   if you have health issues
[00:21:47.680 --> 00:21:50.040]   and you need to do certain things to get in health,
[00:21:50.040 --> 00:21:52.560]   you don't just say, well, it's just too hard
[00:21:52.560 --> 00:21:53.960]   and just kind of allow your health
[00:21:53.960 --> 00:21:56.520]   to deteriorate to a certain point.
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:21:58.700]   Well, when it comes to our spiritual lives,
[00:21:58.700 --> 00:22:00.640]   there are things that we do where we say,
[00:22:00.640 --> 00:22:03.360]   well, it's too hard, you know.
[00:22:03.360 --> 00:22:05.280]   Not a lot of people are good at this.
[00:22:05.280 --> 00:22:07.120]   And so as a result of that,
[00:22:07.120 --> 00:22:09.080]   we have a tendency in our generation
[00:22:09.080 --> 00:22:11.880]   that how do we make it easier for people?
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:13.480]   So if studying Bible is too hard,
[00:22:13.480 --> 00:22:16.360]   we're gonna break it down into bite-sized pieces.
[00:22:16.360 --> 00:22:20.200]   If coming to church and it's too difficult,
[00:22:20.200 --> 00:22:23.880]   we're gonna make it Saturday instead of Sunday
[00:22:23.880 --> 00:22:25.600]   because it's too hard.
[00:22:25.600 --> 00:22:27.840]   And so everything that we do in our generation
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:32.400]   is how can we make it easier for people to become Christian?
[00:22:32.400 --> 00:22:34.680]   And as a result of that, it has affected our preaching,
[00:22:34.680 --> 00:22:37.320]   it has affected the way we organize church,
[00:22:37.320 --> 00:22:40.520]   it has affected the way we do evangelism.
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:41.600]   And one of the key things
[00:22:41.600 --> 00:22:43.920]   that has been compromised is prayer.
[00:22:44.960 --> 00:22:47.360]   Because most people that I know in our generation
[00:22:47.360 --> 00:22:48.680]   have a difficult time praying.
[00:22:48.680 --> 00:22:50.080]   So as a result of that, we say,
[00:22:50.080 --> 00:22:53.080]   well, do you actually have to pray that way?
[00:22:53.080 --> 00:22:54.520]   Do you have to actually get in that position?
[00:22:54.520 --> 00:22:56.880]   Do you actually have to gather together?
[00:22:56.880 --> 00:22:58.800]   And so how do we make it so that prayer,
[00:22:58.800 --> 00:23:01.400]   it becomes easier and easier and easier?
[00:23:01.400 --> 00:23:04.040]   Just, you know, while you're driving, just think.
[00:23:04.040 --> 00:23:05.160]   And do this and do that.
[00:23:05.160 --> 00:23:09.580]   So anything that's difficult, anything that is hard,
[00:23:09.580 --> 00:23:12.460]   we're always thinking of how do you make it easier
[00:23:12.460 --> 00:23:13.300]   for people?
[00:23:13.300 --> 00:23:14.580]   And as a result of that,
[00:23:14.580 --> 00:23:16.740]   we have a generation filled with people
[00:23:16.740 --> 00:23:19.700]   that if it's too difficult to study the Bible,
[00:23:19.700 --> 00:23:22.600]   too difficult to gather, too difficult to wake up,
[00:23:22.600 --> 00:23:24.640]   that the church is more than willing to accommodate
[00:23:24.640 --> 00:23:29.320]   to make it as easy as possible to be a follower of Christ.
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:30.160]   And as a result of that,
[00:23:30.160 --> 00:23:33.180]   we feel we've built up a generation of people
[00:23:33.180 --> 00:23:38.120]   that can only worship Christ if these criterias are met.
[00:23:38.120 --> 00:23:39.900]   And if there's any pressure,
[00:23:39.900 --> 00:23:42.560]   if there's any difficulty, they're out.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.600]   You know, I can't go to that church because of this.
[00:23:44.600 --> 00:23:45.800]   I can't do this because of that.
[00:23:45.800 --> 00:23:47.000]   The word of God is this.
[00:23:47.000 --> 00:23:48.640]   It's not preached this way or that way.
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:51.800]   And so they're so delicate.
[00:23:51.800 --> 00:23:54.120]   And to be honest, it's the church's fault.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.960]   The church's fault because the church has done more
[00:23:56.960 --> 00:23:59.440]   than their part in accommodating.
[00:23:59.440 --> 00:24:01.960]   Prayer is one of those disciplines
[00:24:01.960 --> 00:24:04.500]   where the Bible emphasizes to the degree
[00:24:04.500 --> 00:24:07.120]   that even if for the rest of your life,
[00:24:07.120 --> 00:24:08.820]   as you wrestle to pray,
[00:24:08.820 --> 00:24:12.100]   that you only make couple inches toward Christ,
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:13.740]   it is worth the effort.
[00:24:13.740 --> 00:24:17.400]   That's how strongly the word of God emphasizes this.
[00:24:17.400 --> 00:24:19.880]   Even if you study the Bible every single day
[00:24:19.880 --> 00:24:20.960]   and at the end of your life,
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:23.120]   you only remember portions of the Bible,
[00:24:23.120 --> 00:24:24.200]   it's worth the effort.
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:26.480]   That little amount that you know
[00:24:26.480 --> 00:24:30.880]   is far more life-giving than you would know,
[00:24:30.880 --> 00:24:31.720]   you would understand.
[00:24:31.720 --> 00:24:32.540]   That's what the scripture says.
[00:24:32.540 --> 00:24:37.160]   And prayer is a discipline that is equally important
[00:24:37.160 --> 00:24:40.120]   that we don't just give up because it's difficult.
[00:24:40.120 --> 00:24:41.680]   That we say, you know, when I close my eyes,
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:43.760]   my thoughts begin to wander.
[00:24:43.760 --> 00:24:45.020]   I'm just so tired in the morning.
[00:24:45.020 --> 00:24:46.080]   I'm so tired at night.
[00:24:46.080 --> 00:24:46.960]   I just don't have time.
[00:24:46.960 --> 00:24:48.800]   I'm in the middle of raising children.
[00:24:48.800 --> 00:24:49.760]   I gotta pay bills.
[00:24:49.760 --> 00:24:50.600]   I'm so busy.
[00:24:50.600 --> 00:24:51.920]   I'm not in good health.
[00:24:51.920 --> 00:24:54.120]   So any little hindrance,
[00:24:54.120 --> 00:24:57.200]   our prayer suffers.
[00:24:57.200 --> 00:24:58.840]   And as a result of that,
[00:24:58.840 --> 00:25:01.960]   our spiritual life becomes nothing more than theory.
[00:25:01.960 --> 00:25:03.740]   Just theory.
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:06.640]   Form of godliness.
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:08.600]   And yet there's no power.
[00:25:08.600 --> 00:25:12.080]   There is nothing that makes God more real
[00:25:12.080 --> 00:25:14.120]   than when you pray to this living God
[00:25:14.120 --> 00:25:15.660]   and God answers that prayer.
[00:25:15.660 --> 00:25:18.600]   Whether it's for a short time
[00:25:18.600 --> 00:25:20.520]   or whether it may be for decades
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:22.360]   that you've been praying for this
[00:25:22.360 --> 00:25:23.800]   and you've been crying out to God
[00:25:23.800 --> 00:25:25.720]   and God answers that prayer,
[00:25:25.720 --> 00:25:28.560]   nothing causes your relationship with God
[00:25:28.560 --> 00:25:32.280]   to become more real than when God answers your prayer.
[00:25:32.280 --> 00:25:33.720]   So when we lack in prayer,
[00:25:33.720 --> 00:25:36.040]   when we give up in prayer,
[00:25:36.040 --> 00:25:38.640]   you've given up in pursuing Christ.
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:40.940]   You don't know God.
[00:25:40.940 --> 00:25:42.480]   You just know about him.
[00:25:42.480 --> 00:25:43.580]   You've heard about him.
[00:25:43.580 --> 00:25:45.680]   You've heard other people's testimonies about him.
[00:25:45.680 --> 00:25:47.840]   But you personally do not know God
[00:25:47.840 --> 00:25:51.080]   'cause you've never encountered him.
[00:25:51.080 --> 00:25:53.740]   The most tangible way that we encounter God
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:54.880]   is through prayer.
[00:25:54.880 --> 00:25:59.200]   So prayer is not something that we should easily give up
[00:25:59.200 --> 00:26:01.240]   just because it's difficult,
[00:26:01.240 --> 00:26:02.800]   because it's hard for me to concentrate
[00:26:02.800 --> 00:26:04.120]   or because I'm tired.
[00:26:05.240 --> 00:26:08.760]   Just as much that you need to go to your work every morning,
[00:26:08.760 --> 00:26:09.800]   whether you're tired or not,
[00:26:09.800 --> 00:26:11.400]   whether you had one hour of sleep,
[00:26:11.400 --> 00:26:13.560]   whether your child was up all night
[00:26:13.560 --> 00:26:15.200]   and you didn't have any sleep,
[00:26:15.200 --> 00:26:16.920]   when it's time for you to wake up to go to work,
[00:26:16.920 --> 00:26:19.920]   you go to work because you know your livelihood
[00:26:19.920 --> 00:26:22.120]   is dependent upon that.
[00:26:22.120 --> 00:26:23.120]   You're not gonna get paid.
[00:26:23.120 --> 00:26:24.000]   You can't pay your bills.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:25.360]   You can't eat without it.
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:27.320]   And so you force yourself to go.
[00:26:27.320 --> 00:26:30.880]   Prayer is that important.
[00:26:30.880 --> 00:26:33.040]   The word of God emphasizes to this degree.
[00:26:33.920 --> 00:26:37.080]   So the natural question is, how can we pray effectively?
[00:26:37.080 --> 00:26:39.280]   If prayer is this important, how can we commit to this
[00:26:39.280 --> 00:26:41.740]   so we can become better prayer warriors?
[00:26:41.740 --> 00:26:46.560]   Well, the Bible, again, is also very clear on this subject.
[00:26:46.560 --> 00:26:48.760]   How do you pray in such a way
[00:26:48.760 --> 00:26:50.920]   where you are encountering God?
[00:26:50.920 --> 00:26:52.720]   In John chapter 15 verse seven, it says,
[00:26:52.720 --> 00:26:55.000]   "If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:58.800]   "Ask whatever you wish and it will be done for you."
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.960]   There's a condition to effective prayer.
[00:27:01.960 --> 00:27:03.680]   He says, "If you abide in me."
[00:27:03.680 --> 00:27:07.720]   If your life has already lived for your flesh,
[00:27:07.720 --> 00:27:08.600]   and when I say flesh,
[00:27:08.600 --> 00:27:10.640]   I'm not simply talking about pornography.
[00:27:10.640 --> 00:27:13.440]   I'm just talking about whatever makes you happy,
[00:27:13.440 --> 00:27:17.440]   whatever your flesh desires, and it may not be sinful,
[00:27:17.440 --> 00:27:19.520]   but the pattern of how you make decision is,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.640]   well, that makes me happy, this doesn't make me happy.
[00:27:21.640 --> 00:27:24.880]   If your whole pattern of life is based upon making decisions
[00:27:24.880 --> 00:27:27.040]   to what makes you happy,
[00:27:27.040 --> 00:27:29.560]   there's no way that you are abiding in Christ.
[00:27:31.080 --> 00:27:33.680]   He says, "If you abide in me."
[00:27:33.680 --> 00:27:38.360]   If your pursuit is primary concern is not,
[00:27:38.360 --> 00:27:42.320]   does it make you happy, but is this what God desires?
[00:27:42.320 --> 00:27:46.120]   If you abide in me, and my words abide in you,
[00:27:46.120 --> 00:27:47.720]   he says, "Then ask whatever you wish,
[00:27:47.720 --> 00:27:49.320]   "and it will be done for you."
[00:27:49.320 --> 00:27:53.520]   He said that's the condition of effective prayer.
[00:27:53.520 --> 00:27:54.400]   James says that, too.
[00:27:54.400 --> 00:27:57.640]   He says, "You do not have because you do not ask."
[00:27:57.640 --> 00:28:02.200]   He says, "So, for many of us, the problem is we don't pray."
[00:28:02.200 --> 00:28:05.440]   And so, because we don't pray,
[00:28:05.440 --> 00:28:07.240]   we're living in constant frustration.
[00:28:07.240 --> 00:28:11.360]   Even if you think your cause is a righteous cause,
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:14.400]   your frustration in your righteous cause
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:16.480]   is because of lack of prayer.
[00:28:16.480 --> 00:28:18.920]   You don't see any movement.
[00:28:18.920 --> 00:28:21.560]   You don't see any fruit because you're not praying.
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:22.720]   You're just frustrated.
[00:28:22.720 --> 00:28:25.600]   You do not have because you do not pray.
[00:28:25.600 --> 00:28:27.920]   And then, second, he says, "You do not have
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:30.000]   "because even when you do pray,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:32.520]   "you're not abiding in Christ."
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:35.320]   It's for your own pleasures, your own desires.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.960]   He says, "If you abide in me, my words abide in you.
[00:28:38.960 --> 00:28:41.280]   "Ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you."
[00:28:41.280 --> 00:28:45.160]   So, the key to our spiritual life, experiencing power,
[00:28:45.160 --> 00:28:47.880]   knowing God personally, our affections and love
[00:28:47.880 --> 00:28:51.760]   toward Christ is all contingent upon effective prayer.
[00:28:54.040 --> 00:28:56.800]   Well, if we're to abide in him, his word abide in us,
[00:28:56.800 --> 00:28:59.080]   what is it that we're supposed to abide in
[00:28:59.080 --> 00:29:01.280]   that causes our prayer to be effective?
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:02.440]   That's also clear.
[00:29:02.440 --> 00:29:04.720]   In 2 Thessalonians 3, he says,
[00:29:04.720 --> 00:29:06.600]   "Finally, brethren, pray for us that the word of the Lord
[00:29:06.600 --> 00:29:08.560]   "will spread rapidly and be glorified
[00:29:08.560 --> 00:29:10.880]   "just as it did also with you."
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.360]   The text that we just read in Ephesians chapter six,
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:16.400]   verse 18 and 19, Paul ends the whole letter by saying,
[00:29:16.400 --> 00:29:18.880]   "Pray, pray, pray in all circumstances,
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.280]   "petitioning for all things, for all the saints.
[00:29:21.280 --> 00:29:23.080]   "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:29:24.080 --> 00:29:28.360]   Just in case you didn't get it, that you missed a point,
[00:29:28.360 --> 00:29:29.680]   he repeated over and over again,
[00:29:29.680 --> 00:29:32.000]   "Pray, pray, pray, pray, pray."
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:36.720]   But more specifically, in prayer, he says to pray,
[00:29:36.720 --> 00:29:41.080]   "Pray that the utterance will be given to me,
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:44.080]   "that I may make the gospel, the mystery of Christ,
[00:29:44.080 --> 00:29:46.120]   "more clear, that I would have the boldness
[00:29:46.120 --> 00:29:48.200]   "to spread the gospel."
[00:29:48.200 --> 00:29:51.320]   And that was a consistent prayer request of Apostle Paul.
[00:29:51.320 --> 00:29:53.320]   Colossians chapter four, two to four,
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:54.560]   he says the same thing.
[00:29:54.560 --> 00:29:56.880]   "Devote yourselves to prayer, keeping your Lord in it
[00:29:56.880 --> 00:29:58.960]   "with an attitude of thanksgiving,
[00:29:58.960 --> 00:30:00.760]   "praying at the same time for us as well,
[00:30:00.760 --> 00:30:03.280]   "that God will open up to us a door for the word,
[00:30:03.280 --> 00:30:05.880]   "so that we may speak forth the mystery of Christ,
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.080]   "for which I have also been imprisoned,
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:11.920]   "that I may make it clear in the way I ought to speak."
[00:30:11.920 --> 00:30:16.920]   Apostle Paul was a man with one-track mind.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:19.840]   And remember, he's asking for this
[00:30:19.840 --> 00:30:21.320]   while he's sitting in prison.
[00:30:21.320 --> 00:30:24.720]   He's sitting in prison in Philippi,
[00:30:24.720 --> 00:30:26.760]   he's sitting in Pilate's prison in Coloss,
[00:30:26.760 --> 00:30:27.600]   when he's writing this letter,
[00:30:27.600 --> 00:30:29.840]   he's sitting in prison when he's writing
[00:30:29.840 --> 00:30:30.880]   the letter to the Ephesians.
[00:30:30.880 --> 00:30:33.320]   And each one of those letters,
[00:30:33.320 --> 00:30:36.960]   all he's concerned about is that the gospel be spread.
[00:30:36.960 --> 00:30:38.440]   You would think somebody sitting in prison
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:41.640]   would be saying, "Please pray for my release."
[00:30:41.640 --> 00:30:44.440]   It's very uncomfortable here.
[00:30:44.440 --> 00:30:47.400]   I have this desire to go and visit all the villages
[00:30:47.400 --> 00:30:51.480]   and sitting in prison basically is causing me
[00:30:51.480 --> 00:30:52.520]   not to be able to go.
[00:30:52.520 --> 00:30:53.480]   He doesn't ask for that.
[00:30:53.480 --> 00:30:56.720]   He said, "This is actually causing
[00:30:56.720 --> 00:30:58.320]   "a greater spread of the gospel
[00:30:58.320 --> 00:31:00.760]   "that we're gonna see later on in Philippians."
[00:31:00.760 --> 00:31:04.240]   In fact, what we need to understand
[00:31:04.240 --> 00:31:06.320]   about praying in the Spirit,
[00:31:06.320 --> 00:31:10.680]   praying in the Spirit is praying in line
[00:31:10.680 --> 00:31:12.680]   with what God desires of us.
[00:31:12.680 --> 00:31:16.120]   God's intent for the Spirit in our lives.
[00:31:16.120 --> 00:31:18.880]   He says in Acts 1:8, "You will receive power
[00:31:18.880 --> 00:31:20.960]   "when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[00:31:20.960 --> 00:31:23.960]   Now, again, the context of that,
[00:31:23.960 --> 00:31:27.160]   the apostles failed miserably.
[00:31:27.160 --> 00:31:29.480]   Jesus restores them.
[00:31:29.480 --> 00:31:30.320]   "Do you love me?"
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:32.280]   He said, "Yes, I love you."
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:33.320]   He said, "Feed my sheep."
[00:31:33.320 --> 00:31:36.200]   So Jesus restores Peter, he restores the disciples.
[00:31:36.200 --> 00:31:37.320]   Now they're ready to go.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:40.680]   Jesus is gonna ascend, they're ready to go,
[00:31:40.680 --> 00:31:42.600]   and we're not gonna fail you again.
[00:31:42.600 --> 00:31:44.960]   And Jesus says, "No, stay."
[00:31:45.960 --> 00:31:46.800]   "You will receive power
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:49.040]   "when the Holy Spirit comes upon you."
[00:31:49.040 --> 00:31:51.240]   In other words, you don't have power.
[00:31:51.240 --> 00:31:55.960]   What kind of power are you gonna have against the Romans?
[00:31:55.960 --> 00:31:58.360]   What kind of power are you gonna have even in Jerusalem?
[00:31:58.360 --> 00:32:00.000]   What kind of power are you gonna have
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:01.960]   when these people pick up stones
[00:32:01.960 --> 00:32:05.480]   to kill you because of what you're saying?
[00:32:05.480 --> 00:32:06.640]   You do not have power.
[00:32:06.640 --> 00:32:09.480]   How are you gonna convince these people
[00:32:09.480 --> 00:32:12.240]   who've been worshiping idols for generations
[00:32:12.240 --> 00:32:16.240]   and all of us saying, "Oh, your answers were wrong,"
[00:32:16.240 --> 00:32:18.280]   to repent and turn to Christ?
[00:32:18.280 --> 00:32:20.720]   What power do you have to get sinners
[00:32:20.720 --> 00:32:22.120]   to give their lives to Christ?
[00:32:22.120 --> 00:32:25.600]   You don't have power, but you will have power.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.800]   He says, "When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[00:32:27.800 --> 00:32:29.560]   "and you shall be mine."
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:31.360]   He didn't say, "You try to be."
[00:32:31.360 --> 00:32:33.960]   This is declaring.
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:35.520]   When the Holy Spirit comes upon you,
[00:32:35.520 --> 00:32:39.520]   you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:32:39.520 --> 00:32:41.200]   to the end of the world.
[00:32:41.640 --> 00:32:44.480]   You notice that the purpose of the power
[00:32:44.480 --> 00:32:47.160]   is not simply so that they can experience that power.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:49.760]   He said, "He didn't give you power
[00:32:49.760 --> 00:32:52.080]   "so that you can overcome your temptations,"
[00:32:52.080 --> 00:32:53.520]   although that may be true.
[00:32:53.520 --> 00:32:56.000]   But he says, "The primary reason
[00:32:56.000 --> 00:32:58.000]   "why the Holy Spirit's gonna come upon you
[00:32:58.000 --> 00:33:00.360]   "is so that through that power, to do what?
[00:33:00.360 --> 00:33:03.480]   "To be my witnesses."
[00:33:03.480 --> 00:33:07.160]   So if you're not committed to the Great Commission,
[00:33:07.160 --> 00:33:09.640]   there is no need for the Holy Spirit's power
[00:33:09.640 --> 00:33:10.640]   in your life.
[00:33:10.640 --> 00:33:13.240]   You can come before the Lord and say,
[00:33:13.240 --> 00:33:14.760]   "Lord, I want to experience your power.
[00:33:14.760 --> 00:33:15.920]   "I want to be in your presence.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:17.160]   "I want to know you."
[00:33:17.160 --> 00:33:19.960]   But the purpose of the Holy Spirit
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.400]   is to empower you to be witnesses.
[00:33:23.400 --> 00:33:28.440]   So if you live day to day with no concern of the lost,
[00:33:28.440 --> 00:33:31.000]   and you have forgotten your purpose
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:32.720]   of why we gather here,
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:35.120]   there is no need for the Holy Spirit in your life.
[00:33:35.120 --> 00:33:37.520]   You don't need the power.
[00:33:38.800 --> 00:33:39.960]   No.
[00:33:39.960 --> 00:33:40.800]   Just have assurance.
[00:33:40.800 --> 00:33:42.400]   I'm gonna go, when I die, I'm not gonna go to hell.
[00:33:42.400 --> 00:33:44.360]   I'm gonna go to heaven, and that's it.
[00:33:44.360 --> 00:33:45.240]   Enjoy your life.
[00:33:45.240 --> 00:33:47.640]   Fill your days.
[00:33:47.640 --> 00:33:51.240]   What tickles your ears and your flesh,
[00:33:51.240 --> 00:33:54.600]   because that is not God's will.
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:56.160]   God is not God's purpose.
[00:33:56.160 --> 00:34:01.360]   In fact, the very first passage
[00:34:01.360 --> 00:34:04.960]   that introduces the church
[00:34:04.960 --> 00:34:07.840]   is in Matthew chapter 16, 13 to 19.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:09.880]   Theologians study and dissect this passage
[00:34:09.880 --> 00:34:11.920]   because it's where the church ecclesia
[00:34:11.920 --> 00:34:14.160]   is first mentioned in the New Testament.
[00:34:14.160 --> 00:34:17.880]   And so if you wanna know why Jesus established the church,
[00:34:17.880 --> 00:34:19.800]   you have to understand this text.
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:22.600]   In Matthew 16, 13 to 19,
[00:34:22.600 --> 00:34:26.040]   so now when Jesus came into the district of Caesarea Philippi
[00:34:26.040 --> 00:34:27.200]   he was asking his disciples,
[00:34:27.200 --> 00:34:29.920]   "Who do people say that the Son of Man is?"
[00:34:29.920 --> 00:34:31.960]   And they said, "Some say John the Baptist,
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:34.600]   "others Elijah, but still others Jeremiah,
[00:34:34.600 --> 00:34:35.960]   "or one of the prophets."
[00:34:35.960 --> 00:34:39.320]   He said to them, "Who do you say that I am?"
[00:34:39.320 --> 00:34:40.720]   In order to understand this text,
[00:34:40.720 --> 00:34:42.240]   you have to understand the context.
[00:34:42.240 --> 00:34:44.680]   Like always, you have to understand the context.
[00:34:44.680 --> 00:34:48.240]   The context of this text and why Jesus brings up the church
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:51.400]   is because he is wrapping up his public ministry.
[00:34:51.400 --> 00:34:55.200]   He's getting his disciples to prepare to go to Jerusalem.
[00:34:55.200 --> 00:34:58.320]   Jerusalem is the epicenter
[00:34:58.320 --> 00:35:01.080]   of where the enemies of the cross lie.
[00:35:01.080 --> 00:35:04.400]   The people who are going to lie about Christ,
[00:35:04.400 --> 00:35:06.520]   who's going to beat him and crucify him,
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:08.840]   are concentrated in Jerusalem.
[00:35:08.840 --> 00:35:11.160]   And Jesus is getting his disciples,
[00:35:11.160 --> 00:35:14.240]   where he was praised and loved and honored,
[00:35:14.240 --> 00:35:17.920]   in Galilee, in Capernaum, in Bethsaida.
[00:35:17.920 --> 00:35:19.520]   He's gonna leave that area
[00:35:19.520 --> 00:35:22.360]   and begin to slowly trek down to Jerusalem.
[00:35:22.360 --> 00:35:24.280]   So he needed his disciples to be ready
[00:35:24.280 --> 00:35:26.440]   for the spiritual battle that's coming.
[00:35:26.440 --> 00:35:28.960]   Jesus said before he went to the cross,
[00:35:28.960 --> 00:35:32.120]   he said, "Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat."
[00:35:32.120 --> 00:35:34.760]   We're not sure if Satan has asked his permission yet,
[00:35:34.760 --> 00:35:37.680]   but we know for sure that Jesus is very aware
[00:35:37.680 --> 00:35:39.560]   of the testing that's coming to the disciples.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:43.840]   And that's why he's confirming, "Do you know who I am?
[00:35:43.840 --> 00:35:44.880]   "I know what they say.
[00:35:44.880 --> 00:35:47.160]   "I know what the public opinion, but do you know?
[00:35:47.160 --> 00:35:49.160]   "Because when the testing comes,
[00:35:49.160 --> 00:35:51.720]   "you need to be certain who I am."
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.160]   In 16, Simon Peter answered,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:57.040]   "You are the Christ, the son of the living God."
[00:35:57.040 --> 00:35:59.600]   And Jesus said to him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona,
[00:35:59.600 --> 00:36:02.080]   "because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you,
[00:36:02.080 --> 00:36:04.200]   "but my Father who is in heaven."
[00:36:04.200 --> 00:36:07.040]   As you guys know, they go to Jerusalem.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:10.360]   Jesus gives himself up.
[00:36:10.360 --> 00:36:13.000]   And it confuses the disciples because to them,
[00:36:13.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   the Messiah was gonna walk into Jerusalem
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   and take over power.
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.240]   And that's why they kept on asking,
[00:36:18.240 --> 00:36:20.640]   "Can we sit on your left and to the right?"
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:24.040]   Even though they had the right view of Jesus,
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:26.640]   they had the wrong view of what he was going to do.
[00:36:27.640 --> 00:36:30.960]   And Jesus knew that they were gonna be tested.
[00:36:30.960 --> 00:36:33.000]   And that's why he said,
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:35.080]   "Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat,
[00:36:35.080 --> 00:36:36.680]   "to test you."
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:37.920]   And the testing came.
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:42.800]   And that's why when Peter, this courageous man
[00:36:42.800 --> 00:36:44.560]   who took out a sword and was ready to battle
[00:36:44.560 --> 00:36:47.960]   and die for Christ, all of a sudden becomes a coward.
[00:36:47.960 --> 00:36:50.360]   As Jesus is going to the cross,
[00:36:50.360 --> 00:36:52.280]   he's following him from a distance.
[00:36:52.280 --> 00:36:53.720]   And he was so confused.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.600]   Why would the son of God,
[00:36:57.080 --> 00:37:00.360]   who healed the sick, raised the dead,
[00:37:00.360 --> 00:37:03.720]   have no power over these puny men?
[00:37:03.720 --> 00:37:06.280]   He was so confused.
[00:37:06.280 --> 00:37:08.200]   By the time that the servant girl asked him,
[00:37:08.200 --> 00:37:09.800]   "Aren't you one of his disciples?"
[00:37:09.800 --> 00:37:11.960]   He said, "No, I do not know him."
[00:37:11.960 --> 00:37:14.000]   His confusion made him a coward.
[00:37:14.000 --> 00:37:17.800]   But at the end of the day,
[00:37:17.800 --> 00:37:19.640]   after Jesus was crucified and he resurrected,
[00:37:19.640 --> 00:37:21.040]   all of it came back to them.
[00:37:21.040 --> 00:37:25.080]   And they realized what Jesus was saying all along.
[00:37:26.720 --> 00:37:29.800]   And they're able to withstand the test.
[00:37:29.800 --> 00:37:31.920]   They went through a period of doubting,
[00:37:31.920 --> 00:37:34.080]   questioning themselves.
[00:37:34.080 --> 00:37:34.920]   What is going on?
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:35.760]   What has God's purpose?
[00:37:35.760 --> 00:37:37.440]   What have we been thinking?
[00:37:37.440 --> 00:37:38.360]   But at the end of the day,
[00:37:38.360 --> 00:37:42.520]   what caused them to persevere was not their great courage.
[00:37:42.520 --> 00:37:44.600]   We don't look at the story and say,
[00:37:44.600 --> 00:37:46.440]   "Well, thank God Peter was a courageous man.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.540]   "He was an educated man.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:48.840]   "He was a well-trained man."
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:50.840]   And that's why he was able to withstand the test
[00:37:50.840 --> 00:37:52.640]   and get back up.
[00:37:52.640 --> 00:37:53.600]   No.
[00:37:53.600 --> 00:37:56.520]   The only reason why Peter was able to withstand the test
[00:37:56.520 --> 00:37:58.760]   was because of his faith.
[00:37:58.760 --> 00:38:00.440]   He believed.
[00:38:00.440 --> 00:38:03.360]   Even though what he was seeing didn't quite fit.
[00:38:03.360 --> 00:38:06.280]   Even though what he was experiencing
[00:38:06.280 --> 00:38:08.720]   didn't fit the paradigm of what he thought
[00:38:08.720 --> 00:38:10.080]   the Messiah was going to do,
[00:38:10.080 --> 00:38:13.820]   he never wavered on who he knew Jesus to be.
[00:38:13.820 --> 00:38:16.840]   And that's why Jesus was making sure,
[00:38:16.840 --> 00:38:18.400]   "Do you know who I am?"
[00:38:18.400 --> 00:38:21.840]   In fact, we see that confession in John chapter six,
[00:38:21.840 --> 00:38:22.800]   verse 68.
[00:38:23.780 --> 00:38:27.060]   We had all these people who saw Jesus' miracles,
[00:38:27.060 --> 00:38:29.700]   ate the miraculous bread and fish.
[00:38:29.700 --> 00:38:32.420]   They saw Jesus walking on the water,
[00:38:32.420 --> 00:38:34.220]   catching miraculous fish,
[00:38:34.220 --> 00:38:37.120]   opening the eyes of the men who were blind,
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:38.860]   the lame healing the lame.
[00:38:38.860 --> 00:38:43.140]   And these same men who were coming after Jesus,
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:43.980]   Jesus said to them,
[00:38:43.980 --> 00:38:45.100]   knowing what was in their heart,
[00:38:45.100 --> 00:38:46.980]   "You're not coming after me because you know who I am.
[00:38:46.980 --> 00:38:50.260]   "You're coming after me because you ate and you want more.
[00:38:50.260 --> 00:38:53.140]   "You want a better life.
[00:38:53.140 --> 00:38:53.980]   "You want more fish.
[00:38:53.980 --> 00:38:55.060]   "You want more bread."
[00:38:55.060 --> 00:38:57.400]   And in that, he says, "I am the bread.
[00:38:57.400 --> 00:38:59.700]   "If you eat of any other bread,
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:01.420]   "you're gonna be hungry again,
[00:39:01.420 --> 00:39:02.940]   "but the bread I give you,
[00:39:02.940 --> 00:39:05.900]   "you'll never hunger again."
[00:39:05.900 --> 00:39:07.340]   And knowing what was in their heart,
[00:39:07.340 --> 00:39:08.380]   Jesus said to them,
[00:39:08.380 --> 00:39:09.780]   because of their unbelief,
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.140]   "If you not drink of my flesh,
[00:39:11.140 --> 00:39:13.600]   "drink of my blood and eat of my flesh,
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:14.460]   "I have no part in you."
[00:39:14.460 --> 00:39:15.840]   And he says, "It was too hard for them
[00:39:15.840 --> 00:39:18.820]   "because they did not believe."
[00:39:18.820 --> 00:39:21.660]   In John 6, 66, they walked away.
[00:39:21.660 --> 00:39:24.260]   These are all those people who saw the miracles.
[00:39:24.260 --> 00:39:27.180]   All those people who ate the miraculous,
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:30.240]   and they could not deny his power,
[00:39:30.240 --> 00:39:32.820]   but because what Jesus was saying was difficult,
[00:39:32.820 --> 00:39:34.900]   it tested their faith, and they walked away.
[00:39:34.900 --> 00:39:37.400]   Jesus turns around, asks his disciples,
[00:39:37.400 --> 00:39:39.340]   "Are you gonna walk away too?"
[00:39:39.340 --> 00:39:42.940]   In John 6, 68, it says, "To whom shall we go?
[00:39:42.940 --> 00:39:45.260]   "You have the words of life.
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:47.240]   "We have believed and have come to know
[00:39:47.240 --> 00:39:49.460]   "that you are the Holy One of God."
[00:39:50.740 --> 00:39:52.040]   The disciples, at that point,
[00:39:52.040 --> 00:39:54.180]   didn't understand any more than the crowds.
[00:39:54.180 --> 00:39:56.980]   The disciples saw all the miracles,
[00:39:56.980 --> 00:39:59.500]   but they still didn't fully get it.
[00:39:59.500 --> 00:40:00.800]   But when Jesus turned around and said,
[00:40:00.800 --> 00:40:02.160]   "Are you gonna do what they,
[00:40:02.160 --> 00:40:04.220]   "are you gonna follow your flesh like them?"
[00:40:04.220 --> 00:40:06.800]   And the disciples said, "No, we believe you.
[00:40:06.800 --> 00:40:09.420]   "I don't understand what you're saying.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.260]   "I don't really understand what you're doing,
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:13.140]   "but we believe you.
[00:40:13.140 --> 00:40:14.780]   "Who else are we gonna turn to?"
[00:40:14.780 --> 00:40:17.640]   That's why Jesus was asking that question,
[00:40:17.640 --> 00:40:20.140]   "Do you know who I am?"
[00:40:21.140 --> 00:40:23.860]   You are the Christ, the Son of the living God,
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:28.100]   and it is that confession that caused them to persevere,
[00:40:28.100 --> 00:40:30.180]   and that's why he was preparing them
[00:40:30.180 --> 00:40:31.580]   for what was about to come.
[00:40:31.580 --> 00:40:36.700]   Now, it is in that context we get to verse 18 and 19,
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.180]   where Jesus makes it crystal clear
[00:40:38.180 --> 00:40:40.580]   what the purpose of the church is.
[00:40:40.580 --> 00:40:41.940]   This is where the term church
[00:40:41.940 --> 00:40:44.180]   is first used in the New Testament.
[00:40:44.180 --> 00:40:46.780]   I also say to you that you are Peter,
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:49.460]   and upon this rock, not Peter,
[00:40:49.460 --> 00:40:51.460]   but upon the confession of Peter,
[00:40:51.460 --> 00:40:53.020]   that I will build my church,
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.280]   and the gates of Hades will not overpower it.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:41:00.140]   For years, I looked at this text and said,
[00:41:00.140 --> 00:41:02.980]   you know, Satan cannot penetrate into the church.
[00:41:02.980 --> 00:41:05.920]   Satan cannot come into my home,
[00:41:05.920 --> 00:41:09.540]   because I have the protection of Christ.
[00:41:09.540 --> 00:41:11.560]   This is his church.
[00:41:11.560 --> 00:41:14.680]   But if you look at the text carefully,
[00:41:14.680 --> 00:41:19.300]   he doesn't say that we are the ones inside of the gate.
[00:41:19.300 --> 00:41:22.700]   He says that the gates of Hades
[00:41:22.700 --> 00:41:25.020]   will not be able to prevail against it.
[00:41:25.020 --> 00:41:27.860]   So who's in the offense and who's in the defense?
[00:41:27.860 --> 00:41:30.220]   We are.
[00:41:30.220 --> 00:41:34.740]   The church is the one who is going to the gates of Hades,
[00:41:34.740 --> 00:41:36.160]   and he says the gates of Hades
[00:41:36.160 --> 00:41:38.260]   will not be able to keep you out.
[00:41:38.260 --> 00:41:44.260]   So the purpose of the church is not to make a safe haven
[00:41:44.260 --> 00:41:48.020]   for Christians to run to because it's so bad out there.
[00:41:49.200 --> 00:41:51.200]   The church is not a place where we come
[00:41:51.200 --> 00:41:53.160]   so that we can protect our children
[00:41:53.160 --> 00:41:55.800]   from bad things out there.
[00:41:55.800 --> 00:41:59.320]   Now, in and of itself, we pray that the church community,
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.600]   that those things may happen,
[00:42:01.600 --> 00:42:03.700]   but that is not the purpose of the church.
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:07.160]   He said he commissioned the church
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:10.580]   to bring the light to darkness.
[00:42:10.580 --> 00:42:13.640]   It was for the purpose of the Great Commission
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:15.000]   he commissioned the church.
[00:42:15.000 --> 00:42:17.040]   And then he says I will give you
[00:42:17.040 --> 00:42:19.200]   the keys of the kingdom of heaven,
[00:42:19.200 --> 00:42:21.840]   and whatever you bind on earth shall be bound in heaven,
[00:42:21.840 --> 00:42:25.160]   and whatever you loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.880]   What does it mean to be given the keys of the kingdom?
[00:42:27.880 --> 00:42:29.840]   What does it mean to bind and to loose?
[00:42:29.840 --> 00:42:31.280]   He's talking about authority.
[00:42:31.280 --> 00:42:36.000]   Authority in the church, but authority for what?
[00:42:36.000 --> 00:42:37.600]   You don't just give authority to anybody.
[00:42:37.600 --> 00:42:38.720]   You don't just walk around and say,
[00:42:38.720 --> 00:42:40.440]   okay, now you have authority.
[00:42:40.440 --> 00:42:42.240]   Authority for what, right?
[00:42:42.240 --> 00:42:45.320]   You give authority for a specific purpose.
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:48.560]   In Matthew 10, one, it says,
[00:42:48.560 --> 00:42:50.000]   Jesus summoned his 12 disciples
[00:42:50.000 --> 00:42:51.800]   and gave them authority over unclean spirits
[00:42:51.800 --> 00:42:54.920]   to cast them out and to heal every kind of disease
[00:42:54.920 --> 00:42:56.960]   and every kind of sickness.
[00:42:56.960 --> 00:42:59.100]   Why did he give them authority?
[00:42:59.100 --> 00:43:02.260]   Because he was pushing them into enemy territory.
[00:43:02.260 --> 00:43:06.200]   He's taking the light into darkness.
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.400]   And so, what authority do you have?
[00:43:09.400 --> 00:43:11.000]   And that's the question that's gonna ask.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.920]   If you come and it said, the word of God,
[00:43:13.920 --> 00:43:16.360]   God is going to bring this gospel,
[00:43:16.360 --> 00:43:19.480]   we're gonna turn on the light, by what authority?
[00:43:19.480 --> 00:43:22.880]   And we see that's exactly what Satan asks in the book of Acts.
[00:43:22.880 --> 00:43:24.920]   I know Jesus, I know Christ,
[00:43:24.920 --> 00:43:26.720]   but what authority do you have?
[00:43:26.720 --> 00:43:30.680]   Jesus said, I have given you this authority.
[00:43:30.680 --> 00:43:33.880]   In Matthew 28, 18 to 19, in the Great Commission,
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:35.560]   he said, and Jesus came up and spoke to them,
[00:43:35.560 --> 00:43:38.160]   saying, all authority has been given to me
[00:43:38.160 --> 00:43:42.380]   in heaven and on earth, all authority.
[00:43:42.380 --> 00:43:45.000]   Now, why did he give them this authority?
[00:43:45.000 --> 00:43:46.360]   For what purpose?
[00:43:46.360 --> 00:43:49.760]   He said, so that you can feel safe,
[00:43:49.760 --> 00:43:53.840]   so that when difficulties in life come,
[00:43:53.840 --> 00:43:56.360]   just like it does to everybody, Christian or not,
[00:43:56.360 --> 00:43:59.200]   that at least you have a security blanket,
[00:43:59.200 --> 00:44:01.600]   knowing that an all-powerful, almighty God
[00:44:01.600 --> 00:44:02.580]   is gonna protect you.
[00:44:02.580 --> 00:44:04.420]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:44:04.420 --> 00:44:07.640]   All authority has been given to me, so relax.
[00:44:07.640 --> 00:44:08.480]   Don't worry about it.
[00:44:08.480 --> 00:44:10.120]   When the storm comes,
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:12.360]   all authority in heaven and on earth has been given to me.
[00:44:12.360 --> 00:44:14.520]   Is that what he is saying?
[00:44:14.520 --> 00:44:16.680]   No, he said, all authority in heaven
[00:44:16.680 --> 00:44:19.360]   has been given to me, for what purpose?
[00:44:19.360 --> 00:44:22.120]   Go therefore, make disciples of all the nations,
[00:44:22.120 --> 00:44:23.440]   baptizing them in the name of the Father,
[00:44:23.440 --> 00:44:25.120]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit,
[00:44:25.120 --> 00:44:26.920]   teaching them to observe all that I have commanded you,
[00:44:26.920 --> 00:44:29.220]   and lo, I am with you to the end of the age.
[00:44:29.220 --> 00:44:32.680]   The person who has all authority
[00:44:32.680 --> 00:44:36.800]   is commanding you, commissioning you to go.
[00:44:36.800 --> 00:44:40.040]   So the purpose of authority
[00:44:40.040 --> 00:44:43.540]   is the Great Commission.
[00:44:44.500 --> 00:44:47.740]   Purpose of the Holy Spirit is to empower you
[00:44:47.740 --> 00:44:48.940]   for the Great Commission.
[00:44:48.940 --> 00:44:53.160]   So a church that is not actively in the Great Commission,
[00:44:53.160 --> 00:44:56.220]   if that is not the central heartbeat of the church,
[00:44:56.220 --> 00:45:00.460]   an individual Christian who wants to be a follower of Christ
[00:45:00.460 --> 00:45:03.740]   and yet his heartbeat is not the Great Commission,
[00:45:03.740 --> 00:45:06.060]   has no place for power in his life.
[00:45:06.060 --> 00:45:10.060]   Whatever authority that God has given elders in the church
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.220]   is for the purpose of the Great Commission.
[00:45:13.140 --> 00:45:15.900]   Whatever authority that God has given the husband
[00:45:15.900 --> 00:45:18.700]   to lead his wife is for the purpose
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:21.540]   of bringing that family to Christ.
[00:45:21.540 --> 00:45:24.700]   It's not to make you a king over your house
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:27.060]   so that you can rule for your benefit.
[00:45:27.060 --> 00:45:29.620]   God has made you a leader
[00:45:29.620 --> 00:45:32.300]   so you can lead your family to Christ.
[00:45:32.300 --> 00:45:35.540]   And if you do not lead your family,
[00:45:35.540 --> 00:45:37.220]   your wife and your children,
[00:45:37.220 --> 00:45:39.140]   toward the Great Commission,
[00:45:39.140 --> 00:45:41.640]   your authority is for nothing.
[00:45:41.640 --> 00:45:44.180]   It's just for your ego.
[00:45:44.180 --> 00:45:46.980]   You're asking your family and your wife to follow you
[00:45:46.980 --> 00:45:49.860]   while you're not going anywhere.
[00:45:49.860 --> 00:45:54.440]   The purpose of authority that he gives to the church
[00:45:54.440 --> 00:45:57.340]   is for the purpose of Great Commission.
[00:45:57.340 --> 00:45:59.900]   Colossians 1, 13 to 14 is before he rescued us
[00:45:59.900 --> 00:46:01.740]   from the domain of darkness and transferred us
[00:46:01.740 --> 00:46:04.060]   to the kingdom of his beloved son
[00:46:04.060 --> 00:46:07.580]   in whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins.
[00:46:10.100 --> 00:46:12.580]   We are entering Satan's territory.
[00:46:12.580 --> 00:46:16.400]   Now, if you've ever tried to take something
[00:46:16.400 --> 00:46:18.040]   that is valuable to somebody else,
[00:46:18.040 --> 00:46:22.800]   they're gonna fight you with every power that they have.
[00:46:22.800 --> 00:46:24.920]   You see that.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:25.740]   If you're raising children,
[00:46:25.740 --> 00:46:26.760]   or even if you don't raise children,
[00:46:26.760 --> 00:46:28.920]   if you grew up with siblings
[00:46:28.920 --> 00:46:31.660]   and you wanted something that they have,
[00:46:31.660 --> 00:46:33.200]   they're not gonna say, "Oh, this is the right thing to do,"
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:34.080]   and they're just gonna give it up.
[00:46:34.080 --> 00:46:37.840]   They're gonna, with all their power, all their might,
[00:46:37.840 --> 00:46:40.040]   and whoever has the most power is gonna win.
[00:46:40.040 --> 00:46:43.780]   We are taking the light into enemy territory.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:47.580]   The purpose of who God created this church
[00:46:47.580 --> 00:46:50.880]   was to bring the light into a world
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:46:54.000]   that has been blinded by the God of this age.
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:58.060]   And so Satan is not going to say, "Welcome.
[00:46:58.060 --> 00:47:01.700]   "Come get these children."
[00:47:01.700 --> 00:47:03.420]   He's gonna fight with all his might.
[00:47:03.420 --> 00:47:04.620]   And that's what he was saying.
[00:47:04.620 --> 00:47:07.740]   You're not fighting against flesh and blood,
[00:47:07.740 --> 00:47:09.360]   but against principalities and power
[00:47:09.360 --> 00:47:11.600]   and wickedness and heavenly places.
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:15.280]   So by what authority, by what power would you do this?
[00:47:15.280 --> 00:47:20.080]   And that's why he says to pray, to pray in the spirit.
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:21.400]   And if we're gonna pray effectively,
[00:47:21.400 --> 00:47:24.200]   we have to pray for the purpose of the Great Commission.
[00:47:24.200 --> 00:47:28.800]   And it is in that where Paul says in Ephesians 6, 19 to 20,
[00:47:28.800 --> 00:47:33.960]   "And pray on my behalf that utterance may be given to me
[00:47:33.960 --> 00:47:37.040]   "in the opening of my mouth to make known the boldness,
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:39.320]   "the mystery of the gospel,
[00:47:39.320 --> 00:47:41.580]   "for which I am an ambassador in chains,
[00:47:41.580 --> 00:47:44.260]   "that in proclaiming it, I may speak boldly
[00:47:44.260 --> 00:47:46.160]   "as I ought to speak."
[00:47:46.160 --> 00:47:49.420]   When Paul is asking for utterance,
[00:47:49.420 --> 00:47:51.740]   the word there in Greek is logos.
[00:47:51.740 --> 00:47:56.540]   Most of you guys know logos basically means the word.
[00:47:56.540 --> 00:47:58.340]   But the reason why the NASB
[00:47:58.340 --> 00:48:00.100]   and the New King James, the King James,
[00:48:00.100 --> 00:48:04.220]   translated this utterance is because he's not asking that.
[00:48:04.220 --> 00:48:05.100]   I don't know what to say.
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:06.260]   I don't know what the gospel is.
[00:48:06.260 --> 00:48:08.620]   So can you help me to know what the gospel is
[00:48:08.620 --> 00:48:10.060]   so I know the words?
[00:48:10.060 --> 00:48:12.980]   That's not what Paul is asking for.
[00:48:12.980 --> 00:48:15.500]   Revelation is coming through Paul.
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:17.700]   Paul's the one who's teaching us about the gospel,
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:19.740]   about the mystery of the gospel.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:21.500]   So when he says, "Give me the words,"
[00:48:21.500 --> 00:48:23.280]   he's talking about the anointing.
[00:48:23.280 --> 00:48:26.160]   Not just empty words,
[00:48:26.160 --> 00:48:28.540]   not just putting the right words together.
[00:48:28.540 --> 00:48:33.540]   He's talking about a spirit-powered God's unction to speak.
[00:48:34.540 --> 00:48:39.380]   The Puritans would often call this
[00:48:39.380 --> 00:48:41.740]   the unction of the Holy Spirit.
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:44.660]   They used to say how John Whitefield, when he preached,
[00:48:44.660 --> 00:48:46.540]   there was a special anointing about him
[00:48:46.540 --> 00:48:48.480]   when he opened his mouth,
[00:48:48.480 --> 00:48:49.700]   where people would weep,
[00:48:49.700 --> 00:48:51.220]   and it wasn't because he was necessarily
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:52.940]   an emotional person.
[00:48:52.940 --> 00:48:55.900]   It was that there was such an anointing upon his preaching.
[00:48:55.900 --> 00:49:00.740]   Martin Lloyd-Jones would often say
[00:49:01.860 --> 00:49:03.740]   he didn't want his sermons recorded
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.600]   because you can record the word,
[00:49:05.600 --> 00:49:08.360]   but you cannot record the power of the Holy Spirit.
[00:49:08.360 --> 00:49:10.660]   That's why if you ever listen
[00:49:10.660 --> 00:49:12.060]   to Martin Lloyd-Jones' recordings,
[00:49:12.060 --> 00:49:14.700]   it's always like a hidden microphone
[00:49:14.700 --> 00:49:16.540]   'cause he wouldn't let them record it
[00:49:16.540 --> 00:49:20.160]   'cause you're not gonna capture the spirit.
[00:49:20.160 --> 00:49:22.060]   You may capture the words.
[00:49:22.060 --> 00:49:25.340]   So when Paul is asking for an utterance,
[00:49:25.340 --> 00:49:27.100]   he's not simply looking for words.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:28.540]   "Give me the words to say."
[00:49:28.540 --> 00:49:31.580]   He's saying, "May it be empowered by the Holy Spirit."
[00:49:31.580 --> 00:49:32.700]   Acts chapter 2, 4, it says,
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:34.820]   "And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:49:34.820 --> 00:49:36.240]   "but he had to speak with other tongues
[00:49:36.240 --> 00:49:38.820]   "as the Spirit was giving them utterance."
[00:49:38.820 --> 00:49:44.900]   Now, the significance of the Pentecost here in Acts 2, 4
[00:49:44.900 --> 00:49:46.740]   is that the Holy Spirit comes,
[00:49:46.740 --> 00:49:48.860]   and at the Tower of Babel, God sent them out
[00:49:48.860 --> 00:49:52.380]   because they were selfishly seeking to gather together,
[00:49:52.380 --> 00:49:53.420]   and the more they gathered,
[00:49:53.420 --> 00:49:55.880]   the more sin they accumulated.
[00:49:55.880 --> 00:49:58.540]   So he scattered them as a result,
[00:49:58.540 --> 00:50:00.060]   but now the Holy Spirit comes,
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:02.560]   and he's gathering his people into the church,
[00:50:02.560 --> 00:50:06.100]   but secondly, he's empowering them
[00:50:06.100 --> 00:50:08.540]   so that he may go preach the gospel,
[00:50:08.540 --> 00:50:09.860]   and that's exactly what happens.
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:11.780]   It wasn't organized, it wasn't trained,
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:14.620]   they weren't ordained, they weren't commissioned,
[00:50:14.620 --> 00:50:15.780]   but the persecution comes,
[00:50:15.780 --> 00:50:18.220]   and they begin to go run back to their hometown
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:20.620]   filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:50:20.620 --> 00:50:22.420]   and they began to preach the gospel.
[00:50:22.420 --> 00:50:25.180]   So when you see Apostle Paul's ministry,
[00:50:25.180 --> 00:50:26.800]   everywhere he would go,
[00:50:26.800 --> 00:50:29.520]   there's Christians already there waiting for him.
[00:50:30.520 --> 00:50:33.640]   So the power of the Holy Spirit went with these people
[00:50:33.640 --> 00:50:36.160]   who experienced the filling of the Holy Spirit
[00:50:36.160 --> 00:50:39.660]   and the gospel, and the pre-work was already done.
[00:50:39.660 --> 00:50:44.360]   So when Paul says, "I am looking for utterance,"
[00:50:44.360 --> 00:50:46.000]   he's not simply talking about words,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.880]   he's talking about anointing of the Holy Spirit.
[00:50:48.880 --> 00:50:53.280]   There is a huge difference between regurgitating,
[00:50:53.280 --> 00:50:57.360]   regurgitating the Word of God because you studied it,
[00:50:58.280 --> 00:51:00.800]   because you did your homework,
[00:51:00.800 --> 00:51:02.520]   and then you presented it well,
[00:51:02.520 --> 00:51:04.040]   and you have the three-point outline,
[00:51:04.040 --> 00:51:05.300]   you have nice illustrations,
[00:51:05.300 --> 00:51:08.120]   and maybe you're good at communicating.
[00:51:08.120 --> 00:51:12.120]   There's a huge difference between the presentation of facts
[00:51:12.120 --> 00:51:17.040]   versus somebody who is anointed.
[00:51:17.040 --> 00:51:19.880]   Like even when somebody comes
[00:51:19.880 --> 00:51:21.880]   and tries to sell you something,
[00:51:21.880 --> 00:51:23.440]   there's a huge difference between somebody
[00:51:23.440 --> 00:51:26.040]   who's selling you a product
[00:51:26.040 --> 00:51:29.000]   because that's where they're getting commission,
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.800]   because that's where they get their livelihood
[00:51:30.800 --> 00:51:32.840]   versus somebody who really loves it.
[00:51:32.840 --> 00:51:37.000]   Somebody who loves it will share with you
[00:51:37.000 --> 00:51:38.440]   just because they love it.
[00:51:38.440 --> 00:51:40.160]   They're not being paid,
[00:51:40.160 --> 00:51:42.100]   there's no commission coming with this.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.640]   They're doing it because they experienced something
[00:51:44.640 --> 00:51:45.600]   they want you to experience,
[00:51:45.600 --> 00:51:46.680]   because it made them happy,
[00:51:46.680 --> 00:51:48.520]   they want you to be happy.
[00:51:48.520 --> 00:51:51.280]   Their lives changed, so they want your lives to change.
[00:51:51.280 --> 00:51:53.120]   And there's a huge difference
[00:51:53.120 --> 00:51:56.160]   when the Holy Spirit has consumed that person,
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:51:59.000]   and the word is coming out,
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:00.920]   and that's where he gets a boldness.
[00:52:00.920 --> 00:52:02.600]   Boldness comes with conviction.
[00:52:02.600 --> 00:52:05.660]   Boldness comes with conviction.
[00:52:05.660 --> 00:52:09.040]   If you're not convicted,
[00:52:09.040 --> 00:52:11.240]   you're constantly telling yourself,
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:14.000]   I should be doing that, I should be doing this,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:16.600]   I should be, I feel bad that I'm not doing this.
[00:52:16.600 --> 00:52:20.240]   But when conviction comes, it's a knee-jerk reaction.
[00:52:21.880 --> 00:52:26.880]   You see a child who is in danger out on the street,
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.480]   you don't sit there and think, should I be doing this?
[00:52:30.480 --> 00:52:32.800]   Oh, I should be, I should be running out there,
[00:52:32.800 --> 00:52:34.040]   but it's kind of risky.
[00:52:34.040 --> 00:52:35.440]   Should I be doing, do I have time for this?
[00:52:35.440 --> 00:52:36.560]   You don't think that.
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:38.480]   'Cause you know that's danger,
[00:52:38.480 --> 00:52:41.300]   and you have something that you can do to save that child,
[00:52:41.300 --> 00:52:42.440]   so you move.
[00:52:42.440 --> 00:52:45.120]   That's what a normal human being does.
[00:52:45.120 --> 00:52:48.080]   Part of the reason why we're not bold
[00:52:48.080 --> 00:52:49.740]   is because we're not convicted.
[00:52:51.680 --> 00:52:55.100]   Because we're living our lives thinking
[00:52:55.100 --> 00:52:59.600]   that God's primary desire for my life is to be healthy,
[00:52:59.600 --> 00:53:03.520]   to get a job promotion, to get to the right school,
[00:53:03.520 --> 00:53:06.480]   to raise healthy children, so if they're obedient,
[00:53:06.480 --> 00:53:08.040]   and we come to church, and we serve,
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.480]   and think that that's God's greatest will in our life.
[00:53:11.480 --> 00:53:12.660]   It is not.
[00:53:12.660 --> 00:53:15.500]   Let me make that very clear.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:17.600]   Your safety, your comfort, your long life,
[00:53:17.600 --> 00:53:19.840]   your health for yourself, your wife,
[00:53:19.840 --> 00:53:24.420]   and your children is not God's primary concern.
[00:53:24.420 --> 00:53:28.760]   Test me.
[00:53:28.760 --> 00:53:32.700]   See if the word of God says any otherwise.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:37.280]   His primary concern is the spreading of the gospel,
[00:53:37.280 --> 00:53:40.460]   to come and seek and save the lost.
[00:53:40.460 --> 00:53:43.920]   And he called the church to do the same.
[00:53:43.920 --> 00:53:48.480]   And so as a result, your suffering oftentimes
[00:53:48.480 --> 00:53:51.400]   would lead to greater glory to God,
[00:53:51.400 --> 00:53:53.480]   and greater spreading of the gospel.
[00:53:53.480 --> 00:53:57.400]   In Acts 4.31, it says, when they had prayed,
[00:53:57.400 --> 00:53:59.880]   the place where they had gathered together was shaken,
[00:53:59.880 --> 00:54:02.580]   and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit,
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:06.080]   and began to speak the word of God with boldness.
[00:54:06.080 --> 00:54:09.640]   That's what the Holy Spirit does,
[00:54:09.640 --> 00:54:12.120]   is that it intercedes with groaning
[00:54:12.120 --> 00:54:14.500]   beyond what we understand.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:17.480]   But when you hear carefully what that groaning means,
[00:54:17.480 --> 00:54:21.240]   the Holy Spirit is always groaning to bring us to God,
[00:54:21.240 --> 00:54:24.500]   and is always groaning to take us to the world.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:28.360]   Those two things, anything that's groaning
[00:54:28.360 --> 00:54:29.800]   is for those two purposes.
[00:54:29.800 --> 00:54:32.600]   To bring us to God, and to take us to the world.
[00:54:32.600 --> 00:54:36.880]   If our lives are not given to that,
[00:54:36.880 --> 00:54:39.440]   you cannot pray in the Spirit.
[00:54:39.440 --> 00:54:46.660]   Right now, the only concern you have is the next sale
[00:54:46.660 --> 00:54:49.620]   that's gonna take you to the area that you want to go to,
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:53.120]   and then you try to get on your knees and pray,
[00:54:53.120 --> 00:54:57.560]   Lord, give me the lost, and you know you don't mean it.
[00:54:57.560 --> 00:55:00.440]   It's not in your heart.
[00:55:00.440 --> 00:55:04.120]   You're not abiding in the Spirit.
[00:55:04.120 --> 00:55:07.140]   And as a result, prayer just becomes
[00:55:07.140 --> 00:55:09.240]   a formula for you to follow.
[00:55:09.240 --> 00:55:14.120]   At the end of your life, how would you evaluate
[00:55:14.120 --> 00:55:15.580]   if you lived a good life?
[00:55:16.000 --> 00:55:20.160]   If you didn't get into trouble?
[00:55:20.160 --> 00:55:23.580]   You didn't catch cancer?
[00:55:23.580 --> 00:55:30.120]   You got married at a decent age, had 2.2 children.
[00:55:30.120 --> 00:55:33.440]   You saved enough money for retirement,
[00:55:33.440 --> 00:55:35.400]   and you did some good.
[00:55:35.400 --> 00:55:37.280]   You fought for some causes.
[00:55:37.280 --> 00:55:40.760]   You labored in the church.
[00:55:40.760 --> 00:55:45.560]   And at the end of your life, if you died and lived that life,
[00:55:46.520 --> 00:55:49.120]   would you say on your deathbed, I lived a good life?
[00:55:49.120 --> 00:55:54.200]   I want you to see the perspective that Apostle Paul has.
[00:55:54.200 --> 00:55:59.600]   Philippians 1, 12 to 14, he's sitting in prison,
[00:55:59.600 --> 00:56:02.560]   and all kinds of trouble are coming.
[00:56:02.560 --> 00:56:04.840]   And this was just the first of many times
[00:56:04.840 --> 00:56:05.840]   that he's gonna be sitting in prison.
[00:56:05.840 --> 00:56:07.800]   Eventually, he's gonna get beheaded.
[00:56:07.800 --> 00:56:09.500]   He says this, "Now I want you to know, brethren,
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:11.500]   "that my circumstance have turned out for
[00:56:11.500 --> 00:56:13.200]   "the greater progress of the gospel,
[00:56:13.200 --> 00:56:15.220]   "so that my imprisonment in the cause of Christ
[00:56:15.220 --> 00:56:16.560]   "has become well known throughout
[00:56:16.560 --> 00:56:19.080]   "the whole Praetorian Guard and to everyone else,
[00:56:19.080 --> 00:56:21.120]   "and that most of the brethren trusting in the Lord
[00:56:21.120 --> 00:56:23.560]   "because of my imprisonment have far more courage
[00:56:23.560 --> 00:56:25.880]   "to speak the word of God without fear."
[00:56:25.880 --> 00:56:31.000]   His whole paradigm of what is good and what is bad
[00:56:31.000 --> 00:56:32.560]   is the spreading of the gospel.
[00:56:32.560 --> 00:56:38.240]   His suffering has caused more of the brethren
[00:56:38.240 --> 00:56:40.720]   to have courage to speak and preach the gospel.
[00:56:40.720 --> 00:56:44.280]   Even the people who are doing it for wrong motives,
[00:56:44.280 --> 00:56:47.400]   he says, "Praise God, because the gospel is going out."
[00:56:47.400 --> 00:56:51.680]   Now, is this just Paul?
[00:56:51.680 --> 00:56:53.780]   Is this just the freak of nature of a man?
[00:56:53.780 --> 00:56:57.320]   Or is this God's perspective?
[00:56:57.320 --> 00:57:01.840]   Is this the paradigm in which God will evaluate
[00:57:01.840 --> 00:57:03.740]   whether you and I lived a good life?
[00:57:03.740 --> 00:57:07.400]   Is this a paradigm in which God will look at our church
[00:57:07.400 --> 00:57:09.400]   and say, "This is a good church
[00:57:09.400 --> 00:57:11.240]   "that I will bless and multiply."
[00:57:11.240 --> 00:57:13.760]   Are they safe?
[00:57:14.320 --> 00:57:16.240]   Do they know the Bible?
[00:57:16.240 --> 00:57:18.680]   Can they recite the Lord's Prayer?
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.520]   Do they know the catechisms?
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:23.880]   Is that the criteria where God's gonna look at a church
[00:57:23.880 --> 00:57:26.120]   and say, "That's a healthy, good church."
[00:57:26.120 --> 00:57:31.000]   Or is this the perspective that God will use?
[00:57:31.000 --> 00:57:34.900]   Philippians 1:20-22, "According to my earnest expectation
[00:57:34.900 --> 00:57:38.160]   "and hope that I will not be put to shame in anything,
[00:57:38.160 --> 00:57:40.740]   "but that with all boldness, Christ will even now,
[00:57:40.740 --> 00:57:42.160]   "as always, be exalted in my body,
[00:57:42.160 --> 00:57:43.800]   "whether by life or by death.
[00:57:43.800 --> 00:57:47.040]   "For to me, to live is Christ, and to die is gain."
[00:57:47.040 --> 00:57:50.200]   This is a man who's waiting to possibly be beheaded.
[00:57:50.200 --> 00:57:52.360]   And the only concern that he has
[00:57:52.360 --> 00:57:54.520]   is in the midst of suffering,
[00:57:54.520 --> 00:57:58.900]   in the midst of possibly dying for the cause,
[00:57:58.900 --> 00:58:00.740]   that whether by life or by death,
[00:58:00.740 --> 00:58:04.100]   that he would not be put to shame,
[00:58:04.100 --> 00:58:05.600]   that Christ would be exalted.
[00:58:05.600 --> 00:58:08.400]   And then you know what he says after that?
[00:58:08.400 --> 00:58:11.120]   If you ask me personally what I want, I'm ready to go.
[00:58:12.120 --> 00:58:12.960]   I'm ready to go.
[00:58:12.960 --> 00:58:14.400]   I'm ready to be with the Lord.
[00:58:14.400 --> 00:58:18.880]   Staying here means fruitful labor for me, for you,
[00:58:18.880 --> 00:58:21.600]   and I don't think the work is done.
[00:58:21.600 --> 00:58:23.880]   And because of that, I think I will stay longer
[00:58:23.880 --> 00:58:27.200]   and suffer more, because peace and safety
[00:58:27.200 --> 00:58:29.840]   is waiting for him when he dies.
[00:58:29.840 --> 00:58:32.600]   And he said, "If you're asking me, that's what I want.
[00:58:32.600 --> 00:58:33.720]   "I'm done with the imprisonment.
[00:58:33.720 --> 00:58:34.940]   "I'm done with the beating.
[00:58:34.940 --> 00:58:36.800]   "I'm done with the rejection."
[00:58:36.800 --> 00:58:38.480]   He's a human being like us.
[00:58:40.400 --> 00:58:41.600]   But he knows he's gonna stay
[00:58:41.600 --> 00:58:43.080]   because there's more work to be done,
[00:58:43.080 --> 00:58:46.040]   more suffering, more beating, more imprisonment,
[00:58:46.040 --> 00:58:48.600]   and then beheading that's coming after that.
[00:58:48.600 --> 00:58:52.360]   But he says, "Because the gospel needs to be preached."
[00:58:52.360 --> 00:58:55.480]   He said, "I'm praying that you will pray for me,
[00:58:55.480 --> 00:58:57.060]   "that whether by life or by death,
[00:58:57.060 --> 00:58:59.920]   "that Christ would be exalted in my body."
[00:58:59.920 --> 00:59:03.420]   Is that only Apostle Paul?
[00:59:03.420 --> 00:59:05.520]   Or is that the Holy Spirit speaking to us?
[00:59:05.520 --> 00:59:07.800]   Whether by life or death?
[00:59:09.680 --> 00:59:11.120]   Again, in 2 Timothy 2.10, it says,
[00:59:11.120 --> 00:59:14.200]   "Therefore, I endure everything for the sake of the elect."
[00:59:14.200 --> 00:59:15.680]   Now, when Paul says, "I endure everything
[00:59:15.680 --> 00:59:16.680]   "for the sake of the elect,"
[00:59:16.680 --> 00:59:20.120]   he's not talking about people who just don't like him.
[00:59:20.120 --> 00:59:23.680]   Man, that guy's so weird, you know?
[00:59:23.680 --> 00:59:24.640]   That guy had everything.
[00:59:24.640 --> 00:59:25.480]   Why did he do that?
[00:59:25.480 --> 00:59:27.280]   He's such a weirdo.
[00:59:27.280 --> 00:59:29.120]   He's a Roman citizen, and yet,
[00:59:29.120 --> 00:59:30.720]   he's willing to be in poverty.
[00:59:30.720 --> 00:59:31.560]   He's getting beaten.
[00:59:31.560 --> 00:59:32.440]   He's such a weirdo.
[00:59:32.440 --> 00:59:34.000]   He's not saying, "I endure all things."
[00:59:34.000 --> 00:59:36.160]   He's talking about actual beating.
[00:59:36.160 --> 00:59:37.320]   Thoroughly nine lashes,
[00:59:37.320 --> 00:59:40.040]   where he's at the point of death he's enduring.
[00:59:40.040 --> 00:59:41.800]   Multiple times.
[00:59:41.800 --> 00:59:43.760]   Everybody that knew him, that loved him,
[00:59:43.760 --> 00:59:46.440]   that honored him, is calling him crazy.
[00:59:46.440 --> 00:59:50.600]   This guy was a celebrity before he met Christ.
[00:59:50.600 --> 00:59:52.360]   He was wealthy before he met Christ.
[00:59:52.360 --> 00:59:56.480]   He was the highest educated man among the Israelites,
[00:59:56.480 --> 01:00:00.200]   right under Gamaliel, and he rejected all of that,
[01:00:00.200 --> 01:00:02.920]   and telling this crazy story about some messiah
[01:00:02.920 --> 01:00:04.560]   who was crucified, resurrected from the dead,
[01:00:04.560 --> 01:00:06.680]   and he's asking other people to follow him.
[01:00:06.680 --> 01:00:07.880]   This is weirdo.
[01:00:07.880 --> 01:00:14.200]   He was talking about beating, shipwrecked, rejection.
[01:00:14.200 --> 01:00:19.880]   He said he endures all of it for the sake of the elect.
[01:00:19.880 --> 01:00:22.640]   Is that apostle Paul?
[01:00:22.640 --> 01:00:23.800]   Is that the Holy Spirit?
[01:00:23.800 --> 01:00:28.520]   Of course, it's Paul.
[01:00:28.520 --> 01:00:30.720]   Of course, it's the Holy Spirit.
[01:00:32.720 --> 01:00:37.440]   Our tendency, because of where you and I are raised,
[01:00:37.440 --> 01:00:43.280]   is to naturally think that God's primary desire for you
[01:00:43.280 --> 01:00:47.920]   is to have a good marriage, have multiple children,
[01:00:47.920 --> 01:00:52.480]   good job, nobody gets sick, live a long life,
[01:00:52.480 --> 01:00:54.880]   good retirement, do so good in the church,
[01:00:54.880 --> 01:00:56.920]   fight for some causes, donate a little bit
[01:00:56.920 --> 01:01:01.920]   to this and that, and then die a long life, old age.
[01:01:02.920 --> 01:01:07.520]   You didn't get that from the Bible.
[01:01:07.520 --> 01:01:11.240]   You did not get that from the Bible.
[01:01:11.240 --> 01:01:12.760]   The Bible does not teach that.
[01:01:12.760 --> 01:01:16.560]   As we prepare to go out to India,
[01:01:16.560 --> 01:01:20.520]   I remember, I think this is our ninth or 10th year
[01:01:20.520 --> 01:01:21.360]   that we're going.
[01:01:21.360 --> 01:01:25.280]   The first year we decided to go,
[01:01:25.280 --> 01:01:29.720]   I've had so many people ask me that I shouldn't be going.
[01:01:29.720 --> 01:01:32.360]   You're being reckless because that's an area
[01:01:32.360 --> 01:01:34.120]   where there isn't much help.
[01:01:34.120 --> 01:01:35.560]   If you get lost and something happens,
[01:01:35.560 --> 01:01:37.840]   somebody gets sick or you get beaten,
[01:01:37.840 --> 01:01:41.360]   you're five hours away from anything that we know.
[01:01:41.360 --> 01:01:43.760]   So even the missionaries out in India
[01:01:43.760 --> 01:01:45.680]   were telling us not to go.
[01:01:45.680 --> 01:01:47.200]   They'd say the furthest that they travel
[01:01:47.200 --> 01:01:49.000]   is about two hours.
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.560]   And if they're any further than two hours,
[01:01:51.560 --> 01:01:53.560]   they said they usually have them shipped in.
[01:01:53.560 --> 01:01:56.080]   They give them bus tickets and they would have them
[01:01:56.080 --> 01:01:57.240]   come to the big city and that's where
[01:01:57.240 --> 01:01:58.920]   they would do all the training.
[01:01:58.920 --> 01:02:00.640]   But one of the things I kept on hearing was
[01:02:00.640 --> 01:02:02.960]   once those pastors come and they experience the big city,
[01:02:02.960 --> 01:02:05.600]   they don't want to go back to the villages.
[01:02:05.600 --> 01:02:07.400]   So in one sense, they were telling me
[01:02:07.400 --> 01:02:11.840]   that it's not safe to go out there
[01:02:11.840 --> 01:02:14.160]   and to bring the pastors to come
[01:02:14.160 --> 01:02:15.520]   or don't go any further than that.
[01:02:15.520 --> 01:02:17.960]   But at the same time, the same pastors are telling me
[01:02:17.960 --> 01:02:19.280]   once they come here, they don't want to go back
[01:02:19.280 --> 01:02:20.160]   to the village.
[01:02:20.160 --> 01:02:21.480]   So they have this dilemma.
[01:02:21.480 --> 01:02:25.120]   Well, this is an area that I kept on hearing.
[01:02:25.120 --> 01:02:27.360]   They said there's a great need there.
[01:02:27.360 --> 01:02:30.160]   And I found out that the greatest concentration
[01:02:30.160 --> 01:02:34.080]   of unreached people groups were in that area, in India.
[01:02:34.080 --> 01:02:35.200]   I thought it was in the Middle East
[01:02:35.200 --> 01:02:37.200]   and I found out it's in India.
[01:02:37.200 --> 01:02:39.600]   The greatest concentration of illiteracy,
[01:02:39.600 --> 01:02:42.440]   the greatest concentration of poverty,
[01:02:42.440 --> 01:02:46.040]   it was in that area because anybody who knows India,
[01:02:46.040 --> 01:02:47.760]   they're divided by their language and culture,
[01:02:47.760 --> 01:02:48.920]   even within India.
[01:02:48.920 --> 01:02:51.400]   So you can learn one language and only reach
[01:02:51.400 --> 01:02:54.000]   maybe 30, 40,000 people in a country
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:56.400]   that has 1.4, 1.5 billion people.
[01:02:57.400 --> 01:02:59.560]   And so missionaries go out there and learn a language
[01:02:59.560 --> 01:03:00.880]   for five, six, seven years
[01:03:00.880 --> 01:03:03.240]   and they can't even find the people
[01:03:03.240 --> 01:03:05.360]   because they're so divided.
[01:03:05.360 --> 01:03:08.960]   Well, I heard about these pastors who are way out in India
[01:03:08.960 --> 01:03:11.480]   and one of the guys who came to interpret for me
[01:03:11.480 --> 01:03:13.680]   as we're doing pastoral training was starting to tell me
[01:03:13.680 --> 01:03:14.800]   about what's going on.
[01:03:14.800 --> 01:03:16.480]   They have a team of 40 pastors.
[01:03:16.480 --> 01:03:18.960]   His dad started 45 years ago.
[01:03:18.960 --> 01:03:19.920]   And so I got curious.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:20.800]   I said, "I want to go out there."
[01:03:20.800 --> 01:03:23.000]   So I remember the first year that we went out
[01:03:23.000 --> 01:03:26.280]   and we had a team of maybe about 10 or 11
[01:03:26.280 --> 01:03:29.480]   that went out and some of you might be sitting in here.
[01:03:29.480 --> 01:03:31.120]   I said, "Yes, we're taking a risk
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:33.200]   "and I wanted you to know that where we're going,
[01:03:33.200 --> 01:03:35.080]   "people are telling us it's not safe.
[01:03:35.080 --> 01:03:38.520]   "So if you come with me, I need you to be ready."
[01:03:38.520 --> 01:03:40.840]   And so I remember the first year,
[01:03:40.840 --> 01:03:43.160]   some of you guys may remember the first year we went there
[01:03:43.160 --> 01:03:44.720]   and the first thing that we did,
[01:03:44.720 --> 01:03:47.560]   we were looking for anything Western, right?
[01:03:47.560 --> 01:03:49.240]   And we heard about this Hyatt Hotel
[01:03:49.240 --> 01:03:50.440]   that was way up in the boonies.
[01:03:50.440 --> 01:03:52.440]   And if we go there, if anything happens to us,
[01:03:52.440 --> 01:03:53.480]   that's where we need to go
[01:03:53.480 --> 01:03:55.440]   because that's where the Americans are.
[01:03:56.440 --> 01:03:58.080]   We drove out there for two and a half hours
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.680]   from where we were at and we went there thinking,
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:00.840]   this is the worst place to come.
[01:04:00.840 --> 01:04:03.880]   We went from boonies to real boonies.
[01:04:03.880 --> 01:04:06.560]   And we realized that, okay, if anything happens here,
[01:04:06.560 --> 01:04:09.680]   we just have to get in a car and drive five hours back.
[01:04:09.680 --> 01:04:11.160]   Well, it's been 10 years.
[01:04:11.160 --> 01:04:15.880]   Within those 10 years, in the persecution meter,
[01:04:15.880 --> 01:04:20.240]   India went from number 35 to 40
[01:04:20.240 --> 01:04:21.680]   to now they're number nine.
[01:04:22.880 --> 01:04:27.000]   The persecution has gotten so much more intense.
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:29.160]   Where previous years, it was kind of theory
[01:04:29.160 --> 01:04:30.160]   because we didn't see it.
[01:04:30.160 --> 01:04:33.000]   I mean, we've experienced some, but not to this level.
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:34.600]   This particular year,
[01:04:34.600 --> 01:04:37.000]   every update that I got from the pastors
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:41.320]   had something about how they were being bothered.
[01:04:41.320 --> 01:04:46.840]   Whether it was rocks thrown at them, beaten.
[01:04:46.840 --> 01:04:48.040]   There are a couple of Christian ladies
[01:04:48.040 --> 01:04:50.320]   who were actually kidnapped for several days
[01:04:50.320 --> 01:04:52.200]   and had to be rescued.
[01:04:52.200 --> 01:04:53.880]   The Christian center that we built for them
[01:04:53.880 --> 01:04:55.640]   was attacked more than seven times.
[01:04:55.640 --> 01:05:00.320]   And I asked them, are you sure this is a safe place to be?
[01:05:00.320 --> 01:05:02.720]   And they said, we're okay because the village elder
[01:05:02.720 --> 01:05:05.600]   in that village, who's a Hindu, likes us.
[01:05:05.600 --> 01:05:09.600]   And so even the housing that they're building,
[01:05:09.600 --> 01:05:11.520]   they have to get contractors from out of town
[01:05:11.520 --> 01:05:13.360]   because they threatened everybody in town
[01:05:13.360 --> 01:05:16.880]   that if you labor for this Christian group,
[01:05:16.880 --> 01:05:18.440]   that you're gonna get attacked.
[01:05:19.600 --> 01:05:23.120]   So the obvious question that people ask me is,
[01:05:23.120 --> 01:05:24.320]   why are you going then?
[01:05:24.320 --> 01:05:29.320]   If they were concerned 10 years ago, I mean, now it's real.
[01:05:29.320 --> 01:05:32.920]   And this year, I'm taking my daughter with me.
[01:05:32.920 --> 01:05:36.720]   Now, the question that they ask is,
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.200]   aren't you being reckless?
[01:05:38.200 --> 01:05:42.760]   You have a tendency, I knew it, you ride a motorcycle,
[01:05:42.760 --> 01:05:45.400]   so you're gonna do, say, these crazy things, right?
[01:05:45.400 --> 01:05:46.600]   And that's who you are.
[01:05:48.440 --> 01:05:50.800]   Let me read you a passage, 1 Corinthians 16, 9.
[01:05:50.800 --> 01:05:54.760]   Hopefully, your paradigm will shift.
[01:05:54.760 --> 01:05:58.440]   Paul says, "For a wide door for the effective service
[01:05:58.440 --> 01:06:03.000]   "has opened to me, and there are many adversaries."
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:09.200]   If you grew up in America in the last 100 years,
[01:06:09.200 --> 01:06:12.760]   you said, those two things you think are contradictory.
[01:06:12.760 --> 01:06:14.200]   There are many adversaries,
[01:06:14.200 --> 01:06:15.960]   so therefore, the door is not open.
[01:06:17.320 --> 01:06:20.600]   Many persecutions, where you're gonna have to risk
[01:06:20.600 --> 01:06:22.440]   your health, so the door is not open,
[01:06:22.440 --> 01:06:26.400]   because we think that the door is only open
[01:06:26.400 --> 01:06:31.400]   if a red carpet comes out, and there's a nice place to stay,
[01:06:31.400 --> 01:06:35.360]   safety, Christians have already gone, established,
[01:06:35.360 --> 01:06:37.760]   and we go there with a platform given to us,
[01:06:37.760 --> 01:06:41.080]   we preach the gospel, and then we're able to plant churches,
[01:06:41.080 --> 01:06:42.640]   and then we come back home, talking,
[01:06:42.640 --> 01:06:44.040]   and share with you pictures.
[01:06:45.120 --> 01:06:46.720]   But if they don't want us there,
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.480]   they're throwing rocks at the pastors,
[01:06:48.480 --> 01:06:50.560]   they're beating them up, hoping that they would die,
[01:06:50.560 --> 01:06:53.320]   and we're gonna take our team in there,
[01:06:53.320 --> 01:06:54.760]   then the door is not open.
[01:06:54.760 --> 01:06:57.440]   That's not what Paul says.
[01:06:57.440 --> 01:07:02.360]   Paul's perspective, and the Holy Spirit's perspective,
[01:07:02.360 --> 01:07:04.720]   remember what he says, remember what Jesus said?
[01:07:04.720 --> 01:07:09.720]   "The kingdom of God advances with forceful men violently."
[01:07:12.360 --> 01:07:15.400]   He's not saying he wants us to be violent,
[01:07:15.400 --> 01:07:20.160]   he's saying that the kingdom of God will progress
[01:07:20.160 --> 01:07:22.760]   with people who are committed to the spiritual battle
[01:07:22.760 --> 01:07:24.080]   that he called us for.
[01:07:24.080 --> 01:07:28.840]   Living a nice, safe, comfortable life
[01:07:28.840 --> 01:07:30.880]   is not the will of God.
[01:07:30.880 --> 01:07:34.800]   It doesn't mean that God called you to poverty,
[01:07:34.800 --> 01:07:36.840]   it doesn't mean that God said every single person
[01:07:36.840 --> 01:07:38.680]   had to suffer the same way,
[01:07:38.680 --> 01:07:41.920]   but his primary concern is not your safety.
[01:07:42.920 --> 01:07:46.840]   His primary concern is not your health,
[01:07:46.840 --> 01:07:48.600]   not yours or your children.
[01:07:48.600 --> 01:07:53.240]   The primary cause why we are here
[01:07:53.240 --> 01:07:58.240]   is to advance the cause of Christ into the realm of Satan.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:03.040]   And he promised us that he will build this church,
[01:08:03.040 --> 01:08:06.680]   and the gates of Haiti will not prevail against it.
[01:08:06.680 --> 01:08:11.080]   So you will either join with Christ and follow him
[01:08:11.080 --> 01:08:14.160]   to bring the gospel to the gates of Hades,
[01:08:14.160 --> 01:08:19.040]   or you will live your life independently, away from God,
[01:08:19.040 --> 01:08:21.600]   with a form of godliness,
[01:08:21.600 --> 01:08:25.320]   and never understand the power of God.
[01:08:25.320 --> 01:08:29.360]   All your complaining, all your frustration
[01:08:29.360 --> 01:08:31.720]   is directly linked to the fact
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:34.400]   that you are not drinking from the living water.
[01:08:34.400 --> 01:08:39.160]   All your thirsting, all your fears,
[01:08:39.160 --> 01:08:41.120]   all your concerns, all your anxiety
[01:08:41.120 --> 01:08:43.080]   may be directly linked to the fact
[01:08:43.080 --> 01:08:46.400]   that the Great Commission is not your heartbeat.
[01:08:46.400 --> 01:08:50.080]   This is why he called us.
[01:08:50.080 --> 01:08:53.440]   We don't go because it's safe.
[01:08:53.440 --> 01:08:54.920]   We're doing everything in our power,
[01:08:54.920 --> 01:08:57.040]   and the pastors there are doing everything in their power
[01:08:57.040 --> 01:08:58.240]   to protect us.
[01:08:58.240 --> 01:09:02.960]   But the simple reason why we choose to go
[01:09:02.960 --> 01:09:05.320]   is because the door has been opened wide.
[01:09:07.640 --> 01:09:11.600]   And what we do, it's only for a week,
[01:09:11.600 --> 01:09:16.600]   what we do gives a clear platform for the pastors
[01:09:16.600 --> 01:09:20.560]   to preach the gospel with boldness.
[01:09:20.560 --> 01:09:21.960]   We're only there for a week.
[01:09:21.960 --> 01:09:26.720]   So my prayer as our team leaves this Friday,
[01:09:26.720 --> 01:09:29.320]   and we'll be back the Saturday after, Lord willing,
[01:09:29.320 --> 01:09:34.200]   pray, obviously, we are praying for safety.
[01:09:34.200 --> 01:09:37.360]   I have no desire to see our team hurt.
[01:09:37.360 --> 01:09:43.600]   But beyond that, we pray for the pastors who are there,
[01:09:43.600 --> 01:09:46.280]   that they're the ones who are pushing into villages
[01:09:46.280 --> 01:09:47.360]   where it's unsafe.
[01:09:47.360 --> 01:09:50.320]   They're the ones who are gonna get rocks thrown at them.
[01:09:50.320 --> 01:09:51.600]   They're the ones who are gonna get beaten
[01:09:51.600 --> 01:09:53.520]   and have been beaten.
[01:09:53.520 --> 01:09:55.840]   They're the ones who are in the front line
[01:09:55.840 --> 01:09:58.280]   so that the little thing that we do
[01:09:58.280 --> 01:10:01.560]   for a short period of time will open doors for them
[01:10:01.560 --> 01:10:03.520]   to bring the gospel to them,
[01:10:03.520 --> 01:10:06.840]   that they would have the utterances by the Holy Spirit,
[01:10:06.840 --> 01:10:08.760]   that God would give them the boldness
[01:10:08.760 --> 01:10:10.440]   to make the gospel clear,
[01:10:10.440 --> 01:10:13.360]   that we would play a small part to help them to do that.
[01:10:13.360 --> 01:10:18.240]   My prayer for our church as we go again once
[01:10:18.240 --> 01:10:21.520]   is asking you to pray for us, pray for the team,
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:24.760]   and pray for what's going on, pray for the pastors,
[01:10:24.760 --> 01:10:29.520]   but beyond that, follow Jesus.
[01:10:32.520 --> 01:10:33.840]   Follow Jesus.
[01:10:33.840 --> 01:10:36.760]   Don't say you're gonna follow Jesus.
[01:10:36.760 --> 01:10:38.640]   Don't talk about following Jesus.
[01:10:38.640 --> 01:10:41.680]   Don't share about following Jesus.
[01:10:41.680 --> 01:10:44.200]   Follow Jesus.
[01:10:44.200 --> 01:10:49.000]   If you follow Jesus, I guarantee you,
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.600]   he will lead you to the world.
[01:10:50.600 --> 01:10:53.820]   'Cause that's why he came.
[01:10:53.820 --> 01:10:58.800]   That's why he built this church.
[01:11:01.280 --> 01:11:02.960]   And that's where he will send us.
[01:11:02.960 --> 01:11:05.320]   Let's pray.
[01:11:05.320 --> 01:11:16.860]   Father, help us.
[01:11:16.860 --> 01:11:21.840]   Help us, Lord God, to fight against the lie
[01:11:21.840 --> 01:11:25.980]   of the Orange County life.
[01:11:25.980 --> 01:11:29.880]   Help us to fight against our flesh
[01:11:30.880 --> 01:11:35.880]   that desires to make this life our permanent home.
[01:11:35.880 --> 01:11:39.680]   Help us to fight against the paradigm
[01:11:39.680 --> 01:11:45.540]   that health and wealth is what you primarily desire for us.
[01:11:45.540 --> 01:11:48.960]   Help us to lift our eyes to Christ
[01:11:48.960 --> 01:11:54.320]   who gave up everything, suffered so much
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:12:00.920]   that we may have life, and that through that life,
[01:12:00.920 --> 01:12:05.520]   that we may live the life that Christ lived for us.
[01:12:05.520 --> 01:12:10.580]   Help us, Lord God, to say what he says,
[01:12:10.580 --> 01:12:16.920]   do what he does, and go wherever he goes.
[01:12:16.920 --> 01:12:21.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.200]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
