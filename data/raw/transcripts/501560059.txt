[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.960]   If you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 11, we're continuing on the series on the
[00:00:11.960 --> 00:00:13.840]   heroes of faith in Hebrews chapter 11.
[00:00:13.840 --> 00:00:18.560]   I'm going to be reading from verse 20 through 22.
[00:00:18.560 --> 00:00:21.480]   For my main text, we're just going to be on one verse today.
[00:00:21.480 --> 00:00:31.040]   Hebrews chapter 11, verse 20 through 22.
[00:00:31.040 --> 00:00:36.000]   Reading out of the NASB, "By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau, even regarding things
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:37.300]   to come.
[00:00:37.300 --> 00:00:41.760]   By faith, Jacob, as he was dying, blessed each of the sons of Joseph and worshipped,
[00:00:41.760 --> 00:00:43.840]   leaning on the top of his staff.
[00:00:43.840 --> 00:00:47.960]   By faith, Joseph, when he was dying, made mention of the exodus of the sons of Israel
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:50.160]   and gave orders concerning his bones."
[00:00:50.160 --> 00:00:51.640]   Let's pray.
[00:00:51.640 --> 00:00:58.000]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your grace, we pray for your guidance, we pray for your
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.280]   Holy Spirit to continue to speak to us.
[00:01:01.280 --> 00:01:08.960]   Lord, we know that the exposition of your word, Lord, will only allow us, Lord, to understand
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:13.040]   mentally if your Holy Spirit doesn't illumine us.
[00:01:13.040 --> 00:01:14.160]   So search us, Lord God.
[00:01:14.160 --> 00:01:18.560]   Search our hearts, our thoughts, our motives.
[00:01:18.560 --> 00:01:20.800]   May it be surrendered to your word this morning.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:24.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:24.160 --> 00:01:31.640]   All right, so when I started the sermon, I was planning to cover the three verses.
[00:01:31.640 --> 00:01:37.360]   My goal is not to go one verse a week, but the three verses that we're looking at covers
[00:01:37.360 --> 00:01:41.360]   the history in Genesis, almost 40 chapters.
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:45.960]   So I could just kind of skim over and say, "This is what faith looks like," you know,
[00:01:45.960 --> 00:01:48.520]   and these are some examples of that.
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.640]   Or I can just kind of dive in and review over what's going on in Genesis.
[00:01:52.640 --> 00:01:57.640]   So obviously I've chosen to do the latter, and I think it's beneficial for us to understand
[00:01:57.640 --> 00:02:00.520]   the historical context in which this is going on.
[00:02:00.520 --> 00:02:05.000]   And so the text that we're looking at, it really is covering over about two and a half
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.800]   chapters, and then the other two men that are mentioned, Jacob and Joseph, they're
[00:02:09.800 --> 00:02:12.720]   going to be covering about 12 to 13 chapters each.
[00:02:12.720 --> 00:02:16.200]   But I think it would be beneficial for us to know what's going on in Genesis so when
[00:02:16.200 --> 00:02:20.960]   he says, "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau," regarding things to come, that we know
[00:02:20.960 --> 00:02:23.000]   exactly what he's talking about, right?
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.960]   So instead of just assuming you know the story, I think it'd be good for us to review it,
[00:02:26.960 --> 00:02:30.960]   and it'll help us to understand better why he says what he says.
[00:02:30.960 --> 00:02:36.680]   Right off the bat, we're looking at verse 20, "By faith Isaac blessed Jacob and Esau,"
[00:02:36.680 --> 00:02:38.280]   even regarding things to come.
[00:02:38.280 --> 00:02:42.560]   That verse, if you just skim through it and you didn't ask any questions, that's enough
[00:02:42.560 --> 00:02:47.240]   because it's consistent with everything else he's saying in chapter 11.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:53.720]   But if you've ever read through the history of what's going on behind this verse, it causes
[00:02:53.720 --> 00:02:57.120]   us to take a step back and question.
[00:02:57.120 --> 00:03:01.600]   Isaac was involved in probably one of the greatest highlights in the redemptive history,
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:06.400]   where the sacrifice and then saving him from that was a type of what Christ was going to
[00:03:06.400 --> 00:03:11.720]   do, and we saw the Father's heart through Abraham and the things that he was going through,
[00:03:11.720 --> 00:03:16.240]   and all of that to point to us, to strike in us about what God himself was going to
[00:03:16.240 --> 00:03:17.540]   do with his own son.
[00:03:17.540 --> 00:03:19.480]   And Isaac was the recipient of that.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:23.680]   And Isaac was not a young child.
[00:03:23.680 --> 00:03:28.960]   Most people think he could be as young as 14 or 15 or as old as 20.
[00:03:28.960 --> 00:03:32.440]   So he wasn't a little kid where he didn't understand what was going on.
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:38.960]   And that same guy, you would expect that after that great event, his life would be kind of
[00:03:38.960 --> 00:03:43.680]   he takes the baton and then his faith grows even further than that, and then he's able
[00:03:43.680 --> 00:03:48.840]   to do even greater things than Abraham because he had the benefit of a godly father who went
[00:03:48.840 --> 00:03:53.480]   through all that he went through and then just passed it on to his son.
[00:03:53.480 --> 00:03:59.560]   Instead, it causes us to look at Isaac plus Jacob.
[00:03:59.560 --> 00:04:04.280]   If you know anything behind that story, it's like, what?
[00:04:04.280 --> 00:04:08.920]   All of redemptive history happened like that, right?
[00:04:08.920 --> 00:04:13.480]   And again, we'll review what is happening here, but I think it's important for us to
[00:04:13.480 --> 00:04:18.880]   uncover that we don't look at something, especially in the Bible, like we don't fully understand
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.320]   and we say, "Well, you know, we trust God."
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:21.320]   That's good.
[00:04:21.320 --> 00:04:23.320]   We should trust God, right?
[00:04:23.320 --> 00:04:27.120]   But why did God allow this to happen?
[00:04:27.120 --> 00:04:31.680]   Why does something so important as a line in which redemptive history was going to come
[00:04:31.680 --> 00:04:36.300]   down come through trickery, lying, deception?
[00:04:36.300 --> 00:04:41.220]   Maybe even we might say it was unjust to take that away from Esau.
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:42.220]   Why did God allow that?
[00:04:42.220 --> 00:04:50.880]   And why is that event described in this verse that by faith Isaac blessed Jacob?
[00:04:50.880 --> 00:04:53.440]   What did faith have to do with that?
[00:04:53.440 --> 00:04:58.760]   You know, we could say by trickery, Isaac blessed Jacob, right?
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:02.040]   Isaac was deceived to bless Jacob.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:06.440]   Through Jacob's lying and conniving, he received a blessing.
[00:05:06.440 --> 00:05:11.300]   Through a simple mistake of Esau, he forsook his blessing.
[00:05:11.300 --> 00:05:15.640]   But by faith, what does faith have to do with any of this, right?
[00:05:15.640 --> 00:05:19.760]   So we want to examine this morning what this actually means and try to uncover that.
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:23.640]   And so I'm just going to tell you ahead of time, we're going to spend our time in chapter
[00:05:23.640 --> 00:05:28.120]   25 through 27 just going over the narrative so that we can better understand the story
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:29.920]   behind this statement.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:31.600]   And then my main point is going to be at the end.
[00:05:31.600 --> 00:05:38.400]   I'm going to try to summarize what's going on and why this is stated in verse 20 at the
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.400]   tail end of the message.
[00:05:39.400 --> 00:05:40.400]   Okay?
[00:05:40.400 --> 00:05:43.700]   So first part of it, we want to go over the narrative of what's going on.
[00:05:43.700 --> 00:05:46.400]   As I said, Isaac was just involved, right?
[00:05:46.400 --> 00:05:48.200]   At least in Genesis.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:53.200]   He was just involved in probably the greatest redemptive point where it's so clear what
[00:05:53.200 --> 00:05:54.320]   God was doing through him.
[00:05:54.320 --> 00:06:00.040]   And then he survives that, Jehovah Jireh, saying that God the Father is going to provide.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:04.200]   So again, you would think that the next event that we hear is Isaac with his great faith
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:07.040]   continue to grow even further than Abraham.
[00:06:07.040 --> 00:06:12.440]   Instead, Isaac is described to us very plainly, right?
[00:06:12.440 --> 00:06:14.200]   I mean, it doesn't say he was conniving.
[00:06:14.200 --> 00:06:15.200]   It doesn't say anything.
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:18.240]   He was just like his dad when he was young.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:23.880]   He meets his wife and then he's sojourning in foreign lands and he runs into a greater
[00:06:23.880 --> 00:06:28.280]   nation, the Philistines, and he's afraid just like his dad.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:33.320]   And when he meets King Abednmela, he said, "Tell them that you're my sister instead of
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:34.320]   my wife."
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:38.000]   Same thing that his dad did.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.240]   Because if they find out because you're so pretty that they're going to come and kill
[00:06:41.240 --> 00:06:43.200]   me to get you.
[00:06:43.200 --> 00:06:45.400]   So again, he does the same thing.
[00:06:45.400 --> 00:06:49.120]   Again, the same problem that his dad had when he was young.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:55.160]   But really the whole story of Isaac really centers on his blessing on Jacob.
[00:06:55.160 --> 00:06:57.760]   There's not a whole lot written about him.
[00:06:57.760 --> 00:07:02.160]   And in the redemptive history, that's his highlight at the end of his life, right?
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:08.080]   So at the tail end of Abraham's life, he has great faith, sacrificing his only son, believing
[00:07:08.080 --> 00:07:10.280]   that God can raise him from the dead.
[00:07:10.280 --> 00:07:14.480]   But here's Isaac at the end of his life, he's being tricked.
[00:07:14.480 --> 00:07:19.040]   In humans' point of view, he's blessing the wrong person, right?
[00:07:19.040 --> 00:07:20.200]   So let's take a closer look.
[00:07:20.200 --> 00:07:25.520]   In Genesis 25, 27-34, this is how this is introduced to us.
[00:07:25.520 --> 00:07:31.840]   When the boys grew up, the twins, Jacob and Esau, Esau became a skillful hunter, a man
[00:07:31.840 --> 00:07:38.080]   of the field, but Jacob was a peaceful man living in tents.
[00:07:38.080 --> 00:07:44.640]   Now let's first see who these guys, these guys are twins and the older brother, Esau,
[00:07:44.640 --> 00:07:47.480]   he's the manly man.
[00:07:47.480 --> 00:07:50.600]   He's the guy who hunts, he's the skillful hunter.
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:51.600]   Jacob was peaceful.
[00:07:51.600 --> 00:07:57.440]   And that word peaceful is very important because that's how Jacob is described to us, this
[00:07:57.440 --> 00:08:00.360]   man of faith.
[00:08:00.360 --> 00:08:04.520]   The word peaceful is one of those Hebrew words that you can't translate it with one word
[00:08:04.520 --> 00:08:05.520]   into English.
[00:08:05.520 --> 00:08:11.880]   So if you look at the NIV, it's translated, NIV and the ESV translates that word as quiet,
[00:08:11.880 --> 00:08:13.320]   right?
[00:08:13.320 --> 00:08:15.240]   So kind of related.
[00:08:15.240 --> 00:08:23.480]   New King James translates that word mild, which is a little bit different, nuanced.
[00:08:23.480 --> 00:08:28.600]   King James version, which is almost just straight plain, it just tells you what it is and it's
[00:08:28.600 --> 00:08:32.680]   translated plain.
[00:08:32.680 --> 00:08:34.300]   Jacob was just plain.
[00:08:34.300 --> 00:08:36.360]   That's a little bit different than peaceful.
[00:08:36.360 --> 00:08:41.320]   Peaceful sounds pretty good, that he's not a man of war, but King James says he's just
[00:08:41.320 --> 00:08:43.520]   plain, right?
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:48.240]   So all of these words are very specifically nuanced words because you can't translate
[00:08:48.240 --> 00:08:49.480]   it with one word.
[00:08:49.480 --> 00:08:55.540]   In fact, the literal understanding of that word means complete.
[00:08:55.540 --> 00:08:59.320]   You can kind of see where that word comes from, complete meaning that you're not striving
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.760]   for anything, you're just kind of content.
[00:09:01.760 --> 00:09:08.380]   So I think the best way to summarize all these words is he was just a content man.
[00:09:08.380 --> 00:09:12.020]   He wasn't out there striving, he just lived in this tent, did what his mommy told him
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.020]   to do.
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:14.600]   He was just content.
[00:09:14.600 --> 00:09:16.320]   That's how he's described.
[00:09:16.320 --> 00:09:24.100]   This great man of faith, he was just peaceful, mild, plain, content.
[00:09:24.100 --> 00:09:27.920]   Where Esau was a man of the field, he was a hunter.
[00:09:27.920 --> 00:09:33.160]   So keep that in the back of your mind as we continue to go on this narrative.
[00:09:33.160 --> 00:09:39.600]   Verse 28, "Now Isaac loved Esau because he had a taste for game, but Rebekah loved Jacob."
[00:09:39.600 --> 00:09:45.480]   Obviously Rebekah would love Jacob because Jacob's the one always by her side, right?
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:50.680]   And you could tell why Isaac would love Esau because Esau's a manly man.
[00:09:50.680 --> 00:09:55.600]   He's out there, you know, getting animals to come back and feed his family.
[00:09:55.600 --> 00:09:59.200]   He's doing manly things.
[00:09:59.200 --> 00:10:04.000]   Verse 29, "When Jacob had cooked stew, Esau came in from the field and he was famished.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:09.440]   And Esau said to Jacob, 'Please let me have a swallow of that red stuff there, for I am
[00:10:09.440 --> 00:10:10.840]   famished.'
[00:10:10.840 --> 00:10:12.640]   Therefore his name is called Edom."
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:15.480]   But look at this.
[00:10:15.480 --> 00:10:19.760]   The older brother comes in, he's hungry because he was hunting.
[00:10:19.760 --> 00:10:23.480]   He said, "I'm hungry, can you give me that stew?"
[00:10:23.480 --> 00:10:26.520]   And Jacob says, "Give me your birthright."
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:29.760]   You talk about an unfair exchange, right?
[00:10:29.760 --> 00:10:31.880]   How can you possibly think that that's fair?
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:32.880]   Give me your birthright.
[00:10:32.880 --> 00:10:37.840]   I'll give you a little bit of stew, give me your birthright.
[00:10:37.840 --> 00:10:42.240]   I mean, he's not somebody that we would look at, at least from the narrative, looking at
[00:10:42.240 --> 00:10:45.240]   it as like, Jacob's not the type of guy that you'd want to be friends with.
[00:10:45.240 --> 00:10:47.080]   You know what I mean?
[00:10:47.080 --> 00:10:49.040]   He's conniving to take away his birthright.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:53.600]   And Esau, you know, he's just being a man of the field, he doesn't really think through.
[00:10:53.600 --> 00:10:56.280]   He said, "Behold, I am about to die."
[00:10:56.280 --> 00:10:58.840]   So what use then is the birthright to me?
[00:10:58.840 --> 00:11:02.080]   He's a little dramatic, right?
[00:11:02.080 --> 00:11:03.080]   He's hungry, he's not going to die.
[00:11:03.080 --> 00:11:06.400]   He's like, "A little bit of stew."
[00:11:06.400 --> 00:11:07.400]   Jacob said, "First swear to me."
[00:11:07.400 --> 00:11:10.560]   So he swore to him and sold his birthright to Jacob.
[00:11:10.560 --> 00:11:11.560]   What good is it?
[00:11:11.560 --> 00:11:13.680]   I'm going to die, you know, I'll give you my birthright.
[00:11:13.680 --> 00:11:14.680]   What good is that to me?
[00:11:14.680 --> 00:11:16.280]   Give me a little bit of stew.
[00:11:16.280 --> 00:11:23.720]   Now, you have to understand, what happens here in that text, as silly as that is, determines
[00:11:23.720 --> 00:11:27.400]   Esau's fate.
[00:11:27.400 --> 00:11:31.560]   Not only him, but all his descendants.
[00:11:31.560 --> 00:11:36.280]   And if you remember the history of Israel, Edomites keep coming up in the prophets saying
[00:11:36.280 --> 00:11:41.040]   how Edomites are judged because they gloated over the judgment of Israel.
[00:11:41.040 --> 00:11:45.000]   They were always a stumbling block to the nation of Israel.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:46.000]   Where did all that start?
[00:11:46.000 --> 00:11:53.520]   It started right here, because he was hungry and he was overdramatic.
[00:11:53.520 --> 00:11:54.520]   What good is the birthright?
[00:11:54.520 --> 00:11:56.840]   And he sold it for a pot of stew.
[00:11:56.840 --> 00:12:03.120]   Jacob, on the other hand, he becomes, his name gets changed to Israel, one who wrestles
[00:12:03.120 --> 00:12:04.120]   with God.
[00:12:04.120 --> 00:12:06.800]   And God's redemptive plan comes through this line.
[00:12:06.800 --> 00:12:07.920]   Well, how did he get it?
[00:12:07.920 --> 00:12:10.240]   He tricked his brother.
[00:12:10.240 --> 00:12:14.120]   Instead of being generous and saying, "Man, you must be famished and you brought all this
[00:12:14.120 --> 00:12:19.120]   game for us, the Aedes," he said, "Well, if you want that, give me your birthright."
[00:12:19.120 --> 00:12:21.720]   Maybe knowing his weakness, took advantage of his brother.
[00:12:21.720 --> 00:12:29.120]   And that's how, that's how redemptive history, the redemptive nation of Israel is named after
[00:12:29.120 --> 00:12:31.160]   this guy.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:32.160]   Because he does this.
[00:12:32.160 --> 00:12:39.320]   We look at that and say, "I don't get this."
[00:12:39.320 --> 00:12:40.640]   Why is God allowing this?
[00:12:40.640 --> 00:12:47.680]   Why would such an important thing happen in this way and is allowed?
[00:12:47.680 --> 00:12:53.960]   Well, you have to understand that the birthright here is much more than an average family's
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:54.960]   birthright.
[00:12:54.960 --> 00:13:01.080]   In verse 34, Jacob gave Esau the bread and lentil, and he ate and drank and rose and
[00:13:01.080 --> 00:13:02.080]   went on his way.
[00:13:02.080 --> 00:13:03.080]   He's like, "I'm satisfied.
[00:13:03.080 --> 00:13:04.080]   I gave my birthright.
[00:13:04.080 --> 00:13:06.000]   It didn't cost him anything."
[00:13:06.000 --> 00:13:08.040]   At least not immediately.
[00:13:08.040 --> 00:13:14.280]   But it says, "Thus Esau despised his birthright."
[00:13:14.280 --> 00:13:19.600]   Now typically, when a father passes away at that particular time, the firstborn would
[00:13:19.600 --> 00:13:23.680]   get the double portion of whatever the other children would get.
[00:13:23.680 --> 00:13:28.560]   But the birthright here, the blessing here is not simply talking about financial gain.
[00:13:28.560 --> 00:13:30.560]   That because he's the firstborn, he's like, "What good is it to me?
[00:13:30.560 --> 00:13:31.560]   I should have gotten 10,000.
[00:13:31.560 --> 00:13:33.080]   I'm going to get 5,000."
[00:13:33.080 --> 00:13:34.720]   That's not what he's referring to.
[00:13:34.720 --> 00:13:39.600]   When he says he despised his birthright, this is no ordinary birthright.
[00:13:39.600 --> 00:13:44.720]   Remember, Isaac was the sacrifice that Abraham was supposed to give.
[00:13:44.720 --> 00:13:49.840]   So Isaac, in redemptive history, represented the type of Christ.
[00:13:49.840 --> 00:13:54.920]   His possible death and resurrection, coming back from the dead, God delivering him, was
[00:13:54.920 --> 00:13:56.000]   given through Isaac.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:03.760]   So Isaac, I can almost guarantee, knew full well why his father was doing that.
[00:14:03.760 --> 00:14:08.120]   His father, he probably asked him, "What did you do that for?"
[00:14:08.120 --> 00:14:15.320]   And I can guarantee, right, if Abraham left the Calvary, he was already a pretty wealthy
[00:14:15.320 --> 00:14:21.400]   man when he left, and he's wandering into desert or in areas where he's not safe.
[00:14:21.400 --> 00:14:24.200]   Any human being would say, "Well, if you want to live a nice and comfortable life, just
[00:14:24.200 --> 00:14:25.720]   go back to the Calvary.
[00:14:25.720 --> 00:14:27.240]   Why are we doing this?"
[00:14:27.240 --> 00:14:32.040]   The only reason why he did it is because God said to go.
[00:14:32.040 --> 00:14:33.800]   He promised him.
[00:14:33.800 --> 00:14:38.400]   This covenant promise was the only reason why they did what they did, because what Abraham
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:40.720]   did didn't make any sense.
[00:14:40.720 --> 00:14:47.480]   So I don't think it's a stretch to think that Abraham took every opportunity to tell Isaac
[00:14:47.480 --> 00:14:49.480]   about the covenant blessing.
[00:14:49.480 --> 00:14:51.840]   We're no ordinary family.
[00:14:51.840 --> 00:14:56.680]   And I can guarantee that Isaac told Jacob and Esau about this blessing, about what happened
[00:14:56.680 --> 00:14:57.680]   to him.
[00:14:57.680 --> 00:15:03.640]   The biggest event that happened in Isaac's life was what happened at Mount Moriah, explaining
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:06.360]   to them what God was going to do.
[00:15:06.360 --> 00:15:11.680]   So when Esau said, "Well, what good is my birthright when I'm hungry?"
[00:15:11.680 --> 00:15:15.240]   He wasn't simply rejecting the double portion.
[00:15:15.240 --> 00:15:16.480]   He was rejecting the promise.
[00:15:16.480 --> 00:15:18.280]   "What good is all of that when I'm hungry?
[00:15:18.280 --> 00:15:19.280]   I'm about to die."
[00:15:19.280 --> 00:15:24.800]   And that's why it says he despised his birthright.
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:31.680]   In Genesis 26, 3-4, God reminds Isaac of this covenant.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:32.680]   This is what it says.
[00:15:32.680 --> 00:15:36.840]   "Sojourn in this land, and I will be with you and bless you.
[00:15:36.840 --> 00:15:40.480]   For to you and to your descendants, I will give all these lands, and I will establish
[00:15:40.480 --> 00:15:43.840]   the oath which I swore to your father Abraham.
[00:15:43.840 --> 00:15:47.840]   I will multiply your descendants as the stars of heaven and will give your descendants all
[00:15:47.840 --> 00:15:53.240]   these lands, and by your descendants, all the nations of the earth shall be blessed."
[00:15:53.240 --> 00:15:56.160]   Does that sound familiar?
[00:15:56.160 --> 00:15:58.600]   Does what he says sound familiar?
[00:15:58.600 --> 00:15:59.960]   Yes.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:04.880]   This is exactly, almost verbatim, repeated in Genesis 12, 1, 2, and 3.
[00:16:04.880 --> 00:16:07.920]   This is the covenant that God made with Abraham and his descendants.
[00:16:07.920 --> 00:16:13.920]   And it's reminding Isaac, and again, I don't think it's a stretch to think that Jacob and
[00:16:13.920 --> 00:16:18.200]   Esau knew this very well.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.440]   And Esau just kind of like, "What good is that?
[00:16:22.440 --> 00:16:23.440]   What good is the future?
[00:16:23.440 --> 00:16:24.480]   What good is the blessing?
[00:16:24.480 --> 00:16:30.760]   What good is the covenant promise if I'm hungry and I'm going to die?"
[00:16:30.760 --> 00:16:36.920]   You see, Esau, Esau would have been the better leader.
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:41.680]   In fact, the scripture says Isaac loved Esau.
[00:16:41.680 --> 00:16:46.940]   Not only was, by law, was he obligated to bless his older son, he wanted to bless his
[00:16:46.940 --> 00:16:49.560]   older son because that's the one that would make sense.
[00:16:49.560 --> 00:16:54.400]   He's the firstborn, and he's a manly man.
[00:16:54.400 --> 00:16:59.340]   If you were to choose a leader for the covenant promise who'd lead the nation of Israel, whenever
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.400]   God establishes that, whose line would you choose?
[00:17:03.400 --> 00:17:07.160]   The hunter who knows how to fight?
[00:17:07.160 --> 00:17:10.680]   He knows how to use his weapons?
[00:17:10.680 --> 00:17:13.960]   He's a man of the field.
[00:17:13.960 --> 00:17:27.840]   Or Jacob, smooth, plain, content, quiet, mama's boy, right?
[00:17:27.840 --> 00:17:29.600]   I mean, he doesn't fit.
[00:17:29.600 --> 00:17:35.900]   If you were to put on paper who should lead, where the covenant should go to fulfill this
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:40.840]   great promise, Jacob does not fit the mold.
[00:17:40.840 --> 00:17:47.240]   And he said, on top of that, Esau was very hairy, which is going to come out later.
[00:17:47.240 --> 00:17:52.600]   Everything that you would think about a testosterone-driven manly man who's going to lead this nation
[00:17:52.600 --> 00:17:57.200]   to conquer their enemies, Esau fit that description.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:17:59.160]   And Jacob did not.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:07.080]   And yet, Rebekah hears about the plan that Isaac is about to bless his son, and she schemes.
[00:18:07.080 --> 00:18:09.060]   And look what she does.
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:14.280]   She suggests to Jacob, your father at his old age, he doesn't see well, so I have a
[00:18:14.280 --> 00:18:15.280]   plan.
[00:18:15.280 --> 00:18:19.520]   Instead of having Esau be blessed, I want you to be blessed, right?
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.560]   And so he said, well, look how it's described, verse 11.
[00:18:22.560 --> 00:18:27.280]   Jacob answered his mother and said, behold, Esau, my brother, is hairy man, and I am a
[00:18:27.280 --> 00:18:30.960]   smooth man, right?
[00:18:30.960 --> 00:18:36.000]   You know, the thing that pops out at me is Jacob doesn't say, that don't sound right.
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:40.600]   He said, I'm going to trick my dad.
[00:18:40.600 --> 00:18:41.600]   He doesn't say that.
[00:18:41.600 --> 00:18:44.320]   He's not worried about is it right or wrong.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:47.200]   He doesn't worry about like, that's my older brother, I can't do that to him.
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   He doesn't say that.
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:51.800]   He said, do you think it'll work?
[00:18:51.800 --> 00:18:53.680]   That's what he's asking.
[00:18:53.680 --> 00:18:57.280]   Perhaps my father will feel me, then I will be a deceiver in his sight, and I will bring
[00:18:57.280 --> 00:18:59.200]   upon myself a curse and not a blessing.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   So he's not worried about his dad.
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:02.760]   He's not worried about his brother.
[00:19:02.760 --> 00:19:05.720]   He's worried about what if this backfires?
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.280]   Do you think this will really work?
[00:19:09.280 --> 00:19:14.080]   Verse 13, but his mother said to him, your curse be on me, my son, only obey my voice
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:17.620]   and go get them for me.
[00:19:17.620 --> 00:19:20.400]   So this guy didn't even have enough courage.
[00:19:20.400 --> 00:19:24.520]   What if this backfires, doesn't work, he's hairy and I'm not, you know, and I know he's
[00:19:24.520 --> 00:19:26.960]   old and he's blind, but it's just too obvious.
[00:19:26.960 --> 00:19:29.560]   He said, don't worry, any consequence, I'll take it.
[00:19:29.560 --> 00:19:30.560]   You just do what I say.
[00:19:30.560 --> 00:19:33.880]   So he did what his mommy told him to do, right?
[00:19:33.880 --> 00:19:34.880]   That's what it says.
[00:19:34.880 --> 00:19:40.400]   Verse 14, so he went and got them and brought them to his mother and his mother made savory
[00:19:40.400 --> 00:19:43.080]   food such as his father loved.
[00:19:43.080 --> 00:19:48.160]   Then Rebecca took the best garments of Esau, her older son, which were with her in the
[00:19:48.160 --> 00:19:53.320]   house and put them on Jacob, her younger son, and put the skin of the young goats on his
[00:19:53.320 --> 00:19:55.900]   hands and on the smooth part of his neck.
[00:19:55.900 --> 00:20:00.880]   She also gave the savory food and the bread which she had made to her son, Jacob.
[00:20:00.880 --> 00:20:03.660]   Doesn't this sound like a comedy skit?
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:05.640]   This is redemptive history.
[00:20:05.640 --> 00:20:16.240]   This is the formation of Israel where Jesus is going to come through that line.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:22.120]   And the way that he gets the blessing is he puts on goat skin so that he can pretend like
[00:20:22.120 --> 00:20:23.120]   his brother.
[00:20:23.120 --> 00:20:29.920]   And the first thing I think of is just how hairy was Esau that he was going to touch
[00:20:29.920 --> 00:20:35.040]   the goat's fur and think this is Esau.
[00:20:35.040 --> 00:20:37.960]   He must have been really hairy, right?
[00:20:37.960 --> 00:20:38.960]   Because it works.
[00:20:38.960 --> 00:20:40.960]   Look what it says.
[00:20:40.960 --> 00:20:47.220]   In verse 21, then Isaac said to Jacob, "Please come close that I may feel you, my son, whether
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.540]   you are really my son Esau or not."
[00:20:49.540 --> 00:20:54.440]   So Jacob came close to Isaac, his father, and he felt him and said, "The voice is the
[00:20:54.440 --> 00:20:59.080]   voice of Jacob, but the hands are the hands of Esau."
[00:20:59.080 --> 00:21:02.320]   Just how hairy was this guy?
[00:21:02.320 --> 00:21:03.960]   He was literally touching goat skin.
[00:21:03.960 --> 00:21:14.360]   He said, "Oh, that sounds, you know, I mean, it sounds like Jacob, but it feels like Esau."
[00:21:14.360 --> 00:21:16.640]   Understand what's going on.
[00:21:16.640 --> 00:21:21.760]   God's covenant blessing is coming down through this.
[00:21:21.760 --> 00:21:22.760]   Through this.
[00:21:22.760 --> 00:21:27.080]   You know, there's a lot of strange things in the Bible that sometimes we read and we
[00:21:27.080 --> 00:21:29.200]   just kind of like, oh, it's hard to understand.
[00:21:29.200 --> 00:21:32.920]   So, you know, a lot of times we treat Leviticus like that, right?
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:36.080]   We come through Leviticus and it's like, what?
[00:21:36.080 --> 00:21:37.080]   Blood where?
[00:21:37.080 --> 00:21:38.080]   How many animals?
[00:21:38.080 --> 00:21:40.320]   Women can't sit where?
[00:21:40.320 --> 00:21:42.120]   And you go through all that and say, oh, I don't understand.
[00:21:42.120 --> 00:21:43.120]   I trust God.
[00:21:43.120 --> 00:21:46.800]   There's something important going on, but you just kind of move up, right?
[00:21:46.800 --> 00:21:51.000]   But some of the greatest treasures in the Bible are hidden in these things, right?
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:54.440]   I mean, I remember the time when I was preaching through the Old Testament and I got through
[00:21:54.440 --> 00:21:56.180]   judges.
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:59.760]   And I came to judges and judges is a constant cycle of Israel.
[00:21:59.760 --> 00:22:03.560]   You know, everyone did what was right in their own eyes because they didn't have a king and
[00:22:03.560 --> 00:22:05.920]   they would continually fall into sin.
[00:22:05.920 --> 00:22:10.360]   And then they would cry out to God when they're oppressed and then God raises up a judge.
[00:22:10.360 --> 00:22:13.760]   And there's a couple of stories in there that just, I had such a hard time preaching because
[00:22:13.760 --> 00:22:15.080]   I didn't know what the point was.
[00:22:15.080 --> 00:22:16.280]   There's a guy named Eglon.
[00:22:16.280 --> 00:22:18.680]   Some of you guys may know him.
[00:22:18.680 --> 00:22:22.600]   And he said that Eglon was a guy who was a ruler oppressing Israel and God raises up
[00:22:22.600 --> 00:22:25.440]   a Benjamite and he goes and kills him.
[00:22:25.440 --> 00:22:31.840]   But the guy is so obese that he sticks the knife in him and he can't pull it back out
[00:22:31.840 --> 00:22:33.400]   because it gets stuck, right?
[00:22:33.400 --> 00:22:39.960]   And the Bible describes this, but that's not, that's, it's not, it doesn't end there.
[00:22:39.960 --> 00:22:45.360]   He gets stuck and then he's able to escape because his guards don't come in.
[00:22:45.360 --> 00:22:48.960]   And the reason why they don't come in is because they thought he was relieving himself for
[00:22:48.960 --> 00:22:51.200]   a long time.
[00:22:51.200 --> 00:22:57.840]   But he was in the bathroom and he wasn't coming out and Israel is delivered.
[00:22:57.840 --> 00:23:00.120]   That's in Judges.
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:01.880]   So I remember studying through that.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.800]   I was like, what am I going to preach on this?
[00:23:04.800 --> 00:23:12.360]   What is God teaching us through this couldn't pull the knife out, therefore trust God.
[00:23:12.360 --> 00:23:15.680]   Like what's the point here, right?
[00:23:15.680 --> 00:23:20.840]   And I remember very specifically what I preached there, which I would not preach again.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:25.800]   But I remember preaching that when you are not right with God, that even people like
[00:23:25.800 --> 00:23:27.000]   Eklund can defeat you.
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:30.400]   Like that was my point, right?
[00:23:30.400 --> 00:23:35.240]   Then we talk about Samson, you know, this man of faith.
[00:23:35.240 --> 00:23:38.040]   This guy was a drunken womanizer.
[00:23:38.040 --> 00:23:42.440]   So when I took a close look at him, he's like, this is the judge that God raised to deliver
[00:23:42.440 --> 00:23:43.440]   Israel?
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:49.760]   There's a lot of stories in the Bible where it just doesn't fit, right?
[00:23:49.760 --> 00:23:50.760]   But this is one of them.
[00:23:50.760 --> 00:23:53.360]   This is one of those things where it's like, what?
[00:23:53.360 --> 00:23:55.720]   He did what?
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:56.940]   And think about Esau.
[00:23:56.940 --> 00:23:58.280]   Think about Isaac.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.040]   It says, by faith, Isaac blessed Jacob.
[00:24:03.040 --> 00:24:09.320]   But when you read the redemptive history, what does faith have to do with this?
[00:24:09.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   Think about it.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.720]   He's about to bless his son.
[00:24:13.720 --> 00:24:18.840]   Everything that Abraham did, everything that he went through is all coming down to the
[00:24:18.840 --> 00:24:20.620]   next generation.
[00:24:20.620 --> 00:24:25.680]   And the way it happened was like, you sound like Jacob, but you feel like Esau.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:28.840]   All right, I'll bless you.
[00:24:28.840 --> 00:24:31.560]   That's how it happened, right?
[00:24:31.560 --> 00:24:35.240]   And then it says, by faith.
[00:24:35.240 --> 00:24:39.200]   How do we reconcile this?
[00:24:39.200 --> 00:24:42.820]   Why did God allow this in redemptive history?
[00:24:42.820 --> 00:24:44.380]   Why through this line?
[00:24:44.380 --> 00:24:45.640]   Why in this way?
[00:24:46.320 --> 00:24:52.000]   In fact, if you look at Jesus' genealogy, this is Jesus, the son of God.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:01.320]   There's prostitutes, adulterers, and murderers in Jesus' genealogy, right?
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   And God orchestrated this, and yet we see people in there, it's like, what?
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:10.660]   That person's in Jesus' genealogy?
[00:25:10.660 --> 00:25:14.880]   Why did God not nullify this blessing?
[00:25:14.880 --> 00:25:18.720]   Why wasn't Jacob punished for his lying and scheming?
[00:25:18.720 --> 00:25:20.920]   Why did Esau lose his covenant birthright?
[00:25:20.920 --> 00:25:24.060]   Because of his youthful mistake.
[00:25:24.060 --> 00:25:26.600]   What does this have to do with faith?
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:33.080]   Again, I told you that the main point is at the end, so we're at the end, okay?
[00:25:33.080 --> 00:25:37.400]   You look at Esau, it's like, wow, I mean, that's unfair for Esau, right?
[00:25:37.400 --> 00:25:40.600]   How many of us have made dumb decisions when we were young?
[00:25:40.600 --> 00:25:46.120]   And because of that, his whole heritage, all his descendants started going down the wrong
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:49.960]   path, right?
[00:25:49.960 --> 00:25:50.960]   What happened?
[00:25:50.960 --> 00:25:51.960]   Why was he...
[00:25:51.960 --> 00:25:56.040]   In fact, in Hebrews 12, the chapter we're going to get to pretty soon, in verse 16 and
[00:25:56.040 --> 00:26:03.360]   17, describes Esau this way, that there be no immoral or godless person like Esau, who
[00:26:03.360 --> 00:26:07.960]   sold his own birthright for a single meal, for you know that even afterwards, when he
[00:26:07.960 --> 00:26:12.960]   desired to inherit the blessings, he was rejected, for he found no place for repentance, though
[00:26:12.960 --> 00:26:16.320]   he sought for it with tears.
[00:26:16.320 --> 00:26:21.660]   And in Genesis itself, in 25, 34, it says, "And Jacob gave Esau bread and lentil stew,
[00:26:21.660 --> 00:26:24.000]   and he ate it and drank and rose and went on his way.
[00:26:24.000 --> 00:26:26.840]   Thus, Esau despised his birthright."
[00:26:26.840 --> 00:26:31.520]   We may look at this particular event and say, "Well, he made a mistake.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.840]   He was hungry.
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:35.800]   And he wasn't thinking properly.
[00:26:35.800 --> 00:26:43.800]   There was a mental lapse for a minute, and that's what led to this?
[00:26:43.800 --> 00:26:50.680]   And because of that, he's called immoral and godless, who despised his birthright?"
[00:26:50.680 --> 00:26:58.400]   You have to understand that the rejection of his birthright was not simply a rejection
[00:26:58.400 --> 00:26:59.880]   of twofold.
[00:26:59.880 --> 00:27:07.000]   It was a rejection of all the promise that God made to him and to all the descendants.
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:14.120]   God was planning to bring about the salvation of mankind through the nation of Israel.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:19.440]   And so when he rejected, when he despised it, it may seem like a small act, but from
[00:27:19.440 --> 00:27:22.160]   God's perspective, it was immoral.
[00:27:22.160 --> 00:27:24.920]   From God's perspective, it was godless.
[00:27:24.920 --> 00:27:27.480]   There was no God in his decision.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.560]   And he says it was despised.
[00:27:29.560 --> 00:27:36.360]   You know the word for glory in the Bible literally simply means weighty, something serious.
[00:27:36.360 --> 00:27:38.160]   That's what the word glory means.
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:41.100]   There's something weighty.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:46.480]   So when it says that he simply despised it, he considered it as nothing.
[00:27:46.480 --> 00:27:51.400]   He compared his birthright, the promise of God, the covenant promise, and he compared
[00:27:51.400 --> 00:27:55.880]   it with his hunger, and his hunger was more important.
[00:27:55.880 --> 00:27:58.400]   And he simply despised it.
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:06.600]   What we may look at as a simple mistake, a useful indiscretion, God says, "No, you rejected."
[00:28:06.600 --> 00:28:10.760]   In fact, in Mark chapter 3, 28, it says, "Truly I say to you, all sins shall be forgiven,
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:11.760]   the sons of man.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:16.380]   And whatever blasphemy they utter, but whoever blasphemes against the Holy Spirit never has
[00:28:16.380 --> 00:28:19.000]   forgiveness but is guilty of an eternal sin."
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:25.580]   He said all things can be forgiven except for those who reject his promise.
[00:28:25.580 --> 00:28:28.800]   And that's exactly what it says that Esau did.
[00:28:28.800 --> 00:28:35.860]   Esau considered the weightiness of what God was doing, and he took it flippantly.
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:43.020]   How often do you and I look at simple indiscretions and not realizing what we are doing?
[00:28:43.020 --> 00:28:44.500]   Where we live, it's like, you know what?
[00:28:44.500 --> 00:28:46.540]   Of course God is important.
[00:28:46.540 --> 00:28:50.860]   I'm not saying that God is not important, but I got to pay my bills.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:52.700]   I got to raise my children.
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:53.700]   I got to get married.
[00:28:53.700 --> 00:28:55.620]   I got to do this and I got to do that.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:58.660]   And so we don't look at it as a rejection of God.
[00:28:58.660 --> 00:29:02.340]   We just simply say, "I'm hungry now.
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:08.680]   I got to take care of my needs first, and then I'll consider the big picture," not realizing
[00:29:08.680 --> 00:29:16.260]   that we may be rejecting, despising the promises of God.
[00:29:16.260 --> 00:29:22.140]   The small things that sometimes that seem so urgent in our lives in the context of eternity
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.940]   is so trivial.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:29.620]   Whether we become millionaires, become famous, where our children grow up to become superstars
[00:29:29.620 --> 00:29:37.980]   and taken care of, and we live to 105 years old, all of that eternity is very, very trivial.
[00:29:37.980 --> 00:29:42.260]   But the things that God says in His Word has eternal value.
[00:29:42.260 --> 00:29:48.700]   So His covenant promise, Esau's great sin was that he considered the covenant of God
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:52.260]   not weeding.
[00:29:52.260 --> 00:29:58.980]   Jacob's, he's a guy that's like, "Well, okay, now we see why Esau's sin was so great, but
[00:29:58.980 --> 00:30:03.900]   look at the way Jacob did what he did.
[00:30:03.900 --> 00:30:08.860]   How can he be such a great man?"
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:16.980]   The Bible says that if you have a faith of a mustard seed, I don't know if you've ever
[00:30:16.980 --> 00:30:20.380]   seen a mustard seed, mustard seed looks like a lint.
[00:30:20.380 --> 00:30:25.220]   It's so tiny, but if you see that plant and when it grows, it grows into this great tree.
[00:30:25.220 --> 00:30:29.700]   He says if you have a seed, if you have faith of a mustard seed, you can move what?
[00:30:29.700 --> 00:30:31.080]   Mountains.
[00:30:31.080 --> 00:30:36.180]   So the point that Jesus was making is not that you're a great man, it's not your great
[00:30:36.180 --> 00:30:41.260]   achievements, but if you have faith in this great God, even if it's tiny like a mustard
[00:30:41.260 --> 00:30:47.900]   seed, even if it's hard to see, but it's there, even if you have that, you will see the power
[00:30:47.900 --> 00:30:48.900]   of God.
[00:30:48.900 --> 00:30:49.900]   That's what he said.
[00:30:49.900 --> 00:30:51.180]   And that power isn't the man.
[00:30:51.180 --> 00:30:56.980]   His power is that tiny little connection to this power is where the power is.
[00:30:56.980 --> 00:30:59.340]   That's what Jesus was trying to teach them.
[00:30:59.340 --> 00:31:04.660]   Jacob is a perfect example of a man who had tiny faith, at least at this time, or at least
[00:31:04.660 --> 00:31:08.740]   what we see at this time in his life.
[00:31:08.740 --> 00:31:14.420]   I think the best way for us to understand what Jacob did is this way.
[00:31:14.420 --> 00:31:16.780]   I don't know if you've ever been to a large conference.
[00:31:16.780 --> 00:31:23.380]   You have celebrity pastors come and speak in great sermons, great music, and people
[00:31:23.380 --> 00:31:25.580]   are there lined up early.
[00:31:25.580 --> 00:31:27.020]   The doors open up.
[00:31:27.020 --> 00:31:31.060]   They're like beating everybody to the front seat, and they get there and then they save
[00:31:31.060 --> 00:31:32.060]   50 seats.
[00:31:32.060 --> 00:31:33.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:31:33.700 --> 00:31:37.740]   All their friends and family and cousins who may come there, may not come there, but they're
[00:31:37.740 --> 00:31:40.580]   saving all the seats and everybody else is ticked off.
[00:31:40.580 --> 00:31:43.580]   It's like, "What are they doing?"
[00:31:43.580 --> 00:31:45.380]   This is a conference.
[00:31:45.380 --> 00:31:47.780]   This is like we came here to worship.
[00:31:47.780 --> 00:31:50.100]   And so people watching that may look at it and say, "What are they doing?
[00:31:50.100 --> 00:31:53.140]   They're so selfish."
[00:31:53.140 --> 00:31:58.620]   But the reason why they're doing that is because they want the great seats.
[00:31:58.620 --> 00:32:02.060]   They wanted to be in the front and have the best seats so that they can have the best
[00:32:02.060 --> 00:32:03.060]   blessing.
[00:32:03.060 --> 00:32:05.100]   They can have the greatest views.
[00:32:05.100 --> 00:32:10.180]   They can see that whoever is speaking, all the nuances and emotions on their face, so
[00:32:10.180 --> 00:32:11.300]   they want to have the best view.
[00:32:11.300 --> 00:32:15.940]   So the motive behind what they're doing is great.
[00:32:15.940 --> 00:32:19.100]   But the method in which they did it ticks off a lot of people.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.420]   I don't know if you've ever been to a big conference.
[00:32:22.420 --> 00:32:24.820]   I've been to big conferences like that where it's just eager.
[00:32:24.820 --> 00:32:29.460]   It's like iPhone 18 is coming out and they have to be the first ones to get it, and they
[00:32:29.460 --> 00:32:32.300]   run and they're literally running against other people.
[00:32:32.300 --> 00:32:38.060]   They get there and they spread out like, "Mine!"
[00:32:38.060 --> 00:32:43.220]   I look at what Jacob does here is similar to that.
[00:32:43.220 --> 00:32:51.340]   You could see that tiny faith where he understood what he was getting, and he wanted it.
[00:32:51.340 --> 00:32:58.940]   Let me ask you, what does God want from us more than anything else?
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.540]   More than anything else?
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.860]   To be Bible scholars?
[00:33:04.860 --> 00:33:06.580]   To plant many churches?
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:10.060]   To make disciples of the nations?
[00:33:10.060 --> 00:33:14.780]   All of these things are commanded in Scripture, but what does he desire of us more than anything
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:17.140]   else?
[00:33:17.140 --> 00:33:20.860]   To love the Lord your God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength.
[00:33:20.860 --> 00:33:22.740]   To love him.
[00:33:22.740 --> 00:33:23.940]   To desire him.
[00:33:23.940 --> 00:33:26.300]   To want him.
[00:33:26.300 --> 00:33:27.580]   And that's what worship is.
[00:33:27.580 --> 00:33:32.460]   Worship is when we value something, when we desire something, worship comes from that.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:36.460]   He didn't just say plant churches and make disciples and pray and do all this and be
[00:33:36.460 --> 00:33:41.020]   a good Christian and get things done, bear a lot of fruit so that other people can ... He
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:45.220]   said, "All of these things are true, but the biggest, the most important thing, in fact,
[00:33:45.220 --> 00:33:49.260]   he says, "All of that thing, all of those things that I desire can really be summed
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:50.300]   up in one thing.
[00:33:50.300 --> 00:33:52.460]   To love God with all your heart, mind, soul, and strength."
[00:33:52.460 --> 00:34:06.180]   Jacob, as foolish as he was, as questionable as the method was, he valued what God promised
[00:34:06.180 --> 00:34:08.900]   his family.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:12.620]   And he went and ran to the front seat.
[00:34:12.620 --> 00:34:18.540]   And that tiny little faith, that tiny little faith is what brought the blessing upon his
[00:34:18.540 --> 00:34:19.540]   life.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:23.340]   He said, "Lord, I pray that you will seek me and find me when you search me with all
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:25.780]   your heart."
[00:34:25.780 --> 00:34:28.540]   With all your heart.
[00:34:28.540 --> 00:34:33.700]   And you see that repeated over and over and over again, all throughout Scripture.
[00:34:33.700 --> 00:34:38.820]   You know, the challenge of being a Christian for a while, knowing things, studying the
[00:34:38.820 --> 00:34:43.980]   Bible, is we seek him, but not with all our heart.
[00:34:43.980 --> 00:34:49.500]   I think all of us can remember when we first became Christian when Christ was everything.
[00:34:49.500 --> 00:34:50.860]   He was just not a good thing.
[00:34:50.860 --> 00:34:52.540]   He was everything.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:55.660]   Your life got flipped upside down.
[00:34:55.660 --> 00:34:58.120]   Nothing else seemed to matter.
[00:34:58.120 --> 00:35:02.740]   And for the rest of our Christian life is to look back at that and try to be that same
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:06.100]   person I was when I first met Christ.
[00:35:06.100 --> 00:35:09.820]   Because that's what God desires from us more than anything else.
[00:35:09.820 --> 00:35:13.620]   So in Hebrews 11, 6, it says, "Without faith it is impossible to please him, for he who
[00:35:13.620 --> 00:35:18.660]   comes to God must believe that he is, and he is a rewarder of those who seek him."
[00:35:18.660 --> 00:35:20.820]   But that word "seek" isn't just passively seeking.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:23.140]   NIV says it is earnestly seek him.
[00:35:23.140 --> 00:35:29.180]   King James, in New King James, says, "He who diligently seek him with all his heart."
[00:35:29.180 --> 00:35:39.180]   In fact, Jacob, this slippery mama's boy who used all of his trickery to get the blessing,
[00:35:39.180 --> 00:35:45.700]   he's the guy where his name gets changed to Israel, the one who contends with God.
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:48.540]   And that's the name of Israel.
[00:35:48.540 --> 00:35:51.700]   The apple of his eye.
[00:35:51.700 --> 00:35:57.580]   He calls them people who wrestles with me, who wants me.
[00:35:57.580 --> 00:36:00.780]   That's the name he gives them.
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:04.460]   Because that's what he wants from all of us.
[00:36:04.460 --> 00:36:07.180]   To be people who are contending for God.
[00:36:07.180 --> 00:36:08.620]   Who want him more than anything else.
[00:36:08.620 --> 00:36:10.260]   More than church.
[00:36:10.260 --> 00:36:11.700]   More than friendship.
[00:36:11.700 --> 00:36:13.460]   More than financial security.
[00:36:13.460 --> 00:36:15.180]   I want him.
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:21.180]   And if there's anything that is highlighted in Jacob's life, it's that through all of
[00:36:21.180 --> 00:36:22.740]   his trickery, he wanted God.
[00:36:22.740 --> 00:36:25.420]   He wrestled with God.
[00:36:25.420 --> 00:36:29.620]   And that's why he has a limp on his side, because he wrestled with God.
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:36.020]   He's like, "I'm not going to let you go until you bless me."
[00:36:36.020 --> 00:36:39.940]   That's why Jacob became Israel.
[00:36:39.940 --> 00:36:42.620]   You look at Isaac.
[00:36:42.620 --> 00:36:46.300]   Why didn't he just reverse it?
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:51.580]   Why didn't he, when he realized that he was tricked, say, "Okay, forget it.
[00:36:51.580 --> 00:36:58.140]   I knew you didn't sound like my son, Esau."
[00:36:58.140 --> 00:37:03.900]   You have to understand that at that time, for him to bestow a blessing, he wasn't simply
[00:37:03.900 --> 00:37:04.900]   doing it on his behalf.
[00:37:04.900 --> 00:37:07.100]   He was doing it on God's behalf.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:09.620]   That wasn't for him to give.
[00:37:09.620 --> 00:37:11.460]   That was God's to give.
[00:37:11.460 --> 00:37:17.580]   For him to reverse what he did would have not simply been reversing what he said, but
[00:37:17.580 --> 00:37:18.580]   to go on against God.
[00:37:18.580 --> 00:37:23.660]   Because in the oral tradition, basically declaring that would have been no different than signing
[00:37:23.660 --> 00:37:26.260]   a legal document saying, "I hand all this over to you."
[00:37:26.260 --> 00:37:31.740]   And it wasn't in his authority to simply just wipe that out.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:38.980]   So as small and tiny his faith may have been, it was still faith.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:45.940]   The point of all of this is all of this is described in verse 20.
[00:37:45.940 --> 00:37:48.900]   By faith, Isaac blessed Jacob.
[00:37:48.900 --> 00:37:52.780]   You notice Jacob's name comes first here.
[00:37:52.780 --> 00:37:56.020]   Because he's a younger brother, but his name comes first here because he was the one who
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:57.420]   receives the covenant blessing.
[00:37:57.420 --> 00:37:59.420]   Esau gets the other stuff.
[00:37:59.420 --> 00:38:03.900]   They're blessed, even regarding things to come.
[00:38:03.900 --> 00:38:07.900]   So the point of the story is not about Isaac.
[00:38:07.900 --> 00:38:09.620]   The point of the story is not about Jacob.
[00:38:09.620 --> 00:38:12.420]   It's not about Esau, ultimately.
[00:38:12.420 --> 00:38:20.380]   It's about a faithful God who keeps his promise, even through all this mess.
[00:38:20.380 --> 00:38:26.340]   And if there's one thing that stands out of all of this, it's this tiny faith.
[00:38:26.340 --> 00:38:32.940]   This tiny faith that connects them to this great God is why you and I are still here
[00:38:32.940 --> 00:38:34.780]   today.
[00:38:34.780 --> 00:38:43.020]   We could probably pinpoint a minimum of two to three dozen times in redemptive history
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:46.460]   where you and I should have been gone.
[00:38:46.460 --> 00:38:53.460]   I mean, think about a thousand years of the Catholics restricting God's people from his
[00:38:53.460 --> 00:39:01.340]   word and literally killing people for wanting to translate his word, selling salvation through
[00:39:01.340 --> 00:39:02.340]   indulgences.
[00:39:02.340 --> 00:39:05.540]   We're not talking about a couple years.
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:06.540]   We're talking about generations.
[00:39:06.540 --> 00:39:07.540]   Look at it.
[00:39:07.540 --> 00:39:08.540]   We don't have to go that far.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:10.660]   Look at the chaos that you and I are in today.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:16.940]   I mean, people say, like, it's hard to find a church where the word of God is taught.
[00:39:16.940 --> 00:39:24.860]   I mean, as sad as that is, how many of you knew people that you thought were men of God
[00:39:24.860 --> 00:39:27.740]   at one point and were disappointed?
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:29.740]   All of us.
[00:39:29.740 --> 00:39:32.300]   I'm pretty sure I've disappointed you.
[00:39:32.300 --> 00:39:33.300]   Pretty sure.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:38.460]   And if I have it, it's because you're new.
[00:39:38.460 --> 00:39:45.660]   When we look at man, the end conclusion is always, it's going to end in anxiety.
[00:39:45.660 --> 00:39:49.300]   We're going to be distraught.
[00:39:49.300 --> 00:39:52.500]   How can God allow this?
[00:39:52.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   If the only reason why you and I are still here is because Jesus said, "I will build
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:01.220]   my church and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:40:01.220 --> 00:40:07.340]   It was small faith in a great God why you and I are here today.
[00:40:07.340 --> 00:40:14.260]   So if there's anything that we learn from this, anchor in Christ.
[00:40:14.260 --> 00:40:15.980]   Anchor in Christ.
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:23.700]   Not your friendship, not your community, not your bank account, not other people.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:24.700]   In Christ.
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:28.740]   Let me read a couple of verses for you before we end.
[00:40:28.740 --> 00:40:35.220]   2 Corinthians 1.20, "For as many as are the promises of God, in Him they are yes.
[00:40:35.220 --> 00:40:39.580]   Therefore also through Him is our amen to the glory of God through us."
[00:40:39.580 --> 00:40:44.260]   1 Peter 1.24, "For all flesh like grass and all its glory like the flowers of the grass.
[00:40:44.260 --> 00:40:49.060]   The grass withers and the flower falls off, but the word of the Lord endures forever.
[00:40:49.060 --> 00:40:53.060]   And this is the word which was preached to you."
[00:40:53.060 --> 00:40:54.060]   Amen.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:57.780]   Let's pray.
[00:40:57.780 --> 00:41:03.060]   As our worship team comes up, why don't we take a few minutes to reflect and to pray.
[00:41:03.060 --> 00:41:08.100]   If our hearts had caused us to drift, put our confidence in things that we shouldn't
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:09.820]   have.
[00:41:09.820 --> 00:41:15.100]   Maybe there's people who've disappointed you in life and you are drifting as a result of
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:16.940]   that.
[00:41:16.940 --> 00:41:23.220]   I hope that this would serve as a reminder to us that our God is sovereign.
[00:41:23.220 --> 00:41:27.780]   There's times when we feel like our faith is even smaller than a mustard seed.
[00:41:27.780 --> 00:41:34.060]   And yet it is that tiny mustard seed that connects us to God where we see God being
[00:41:34.060 --> 00:41:36.620]   faithful to His promise.
[00:41:36.620 --> 00:41:40.660]   So wherever you are in your faith, let's take some time to pray and ask the Lord to open
[00:41:40.660 --> 00:41:45.620]   our eyes so that we may see the glory, the weightiness of who He is and that we may not
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:49.700]   despise the things that God has called us to be.
[00:41:49.700 --> 00:41:52.220]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team comes up.
[00:41:52.220 --> 00:42:00.480]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
