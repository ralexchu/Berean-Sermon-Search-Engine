[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.000]   [applause]
[00:00:01.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   Next up, Larry Summers.
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   [music]
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:32.000]   [music]
[00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   Larry is an absolutely incredible human being.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   He was the president of Harvard.
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000]   He was Treasury Secretary under Clinton.
[00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   He was Obama's head of the NEC.
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   He's been on the board of some very well-known tech startups like Square, now Block.
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000]   He's been a great friend of mine for 12 or 13 years.
[00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   He taught my son calculus.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   But I want to start with one very quick story.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   Larry was staying at my house, and he runs into the kitchen, and he says,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   "Jamal, the internet is not working. I have an extremely important Zoom."
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   And I said, "Oh, yeah, no problem. You can just use this thing over here."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   And he goes, "Oh, I need you to help me get on the Zoom."
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   So I'm like this IT guy helping him get on the Zoom.
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:28.000]   And up pops a picture of the governor of the DOJ, the Bank of Japan.
[00:01:28.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   And I was like, "What's going on?"
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   And he says, "Jamal, if I'm a little peckish, could I just get anything you have over here to eat?"
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   So I go outside, and my mom's like, "What is going on?"
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   And I said, "Oh, Larry Summers has a meeting with the head of the BOJ."
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   She goes, "The head of the BOJ?"
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   And she stops me on the head and she goes, "We must make him something to eat."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   And so we made scrambled eggs and orange juice.
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   And then at the end of it, she's like, "Who is he, this person talking to the head of the BOJ?"
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   And I said, "It's Larry Summers, blah, blah, blah."
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   And then once she heard that it was Clinton, she hit me on the top of the head again, and she worked for Clinton.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And she said, "We should have given him fresh-squeezed orange juice."
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   [Laughter]
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   Okay.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:14.000]   He is literally one of the most stimulating intellectual people that I know.
[00:02:14.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   So let's start with the most pressing question.
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   CPI is going to come out tomorrow, Larry.
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   You have basically become the shadow secretary of the Treasury and the shadow Fed governor.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   Where are we going?
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   Where are we in the cycle?
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:31.000]   What is happening to the consumer?
[00:02:31.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   Give us just the five-minute redux on the economy.
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   We have a thing in politics, Shamath, it's called the management of expectations.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   And you have just failed me completely in that regard.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Look, there are two kinds of economists.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   There's those who know they don't know and those who don't know they don't know.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:02.000]   I'm in the first category, so I'll give you my best guesses, but that's what they are.
[00:03:02.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   What Samuel Johnson said about second marriage is true of soft landings.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   They represent the triumph of hope over experience.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:15.000]   [Laughter]
[00:03:15.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   [Applause]
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   There's never been a time when inflation was above 4 and unemployment was below 4
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   and the U.S. economy didn't go into recession before that situation was resolved.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   That's why I've been kind of a Cassandra on inflation and the cyclical outlook for the last couple of years.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:50.000]   Here's the way I think about soft landing.
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.000]   You've got this plane.
[00:03:52.000 --> 00:04:00.000]   It's ultimately aspiring to fly very fast and then land on an aircraft carrier.
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.000]   It was way off course and seemingly out of control.
[00:04:07.000 --> 00:04:12.000]   The pilot figured out that it was all screwed up,
[00:04:12.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   and now the pilot's got the plane on a reasonable course, and that's good.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   But it's still 300 yards above the deck of the aircraft carrier,
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and it's still going very fast,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   and it's still an open question whether it's going to hit the aircraft carrier
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   rather than land on the aircraft carrier
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:47.000]   or whether it's going to overfly the aircraft carrier
[00:04:47.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   and have to turn around and achieve a soft landing.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:59.000]   And I think all of that is still very much at risk.
[00:04:59.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   The people who say it's all okay, we never need to worry about inflation,
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:08.000]   inflation was 9, inflation's now 3.5,
[00:05:08.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   it's all under control, we're all done,
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:16.000]   don't know what they're talking about.
[00:05:16.000 --> 00:05:18.000]   It could turn out to be right,
[00:05:18.000 --> 00:05:26.000]   but inflation was never on an underlying basis anything like 8 or 9.
[00:05:26.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   It was like 5, artificially pushed up by used cars and airline fares
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   and a bunch of stuff like that, gasoline.
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:42.000]   And the thing about stuff that mean reverts is that it mean reverts.
[00:05:42.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   And so when that stuff was going up real fast,
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   we had 8% inflation with an underlying inflation rate of 5%.
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   When that stuff collapses,
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   we have an underlying rate of inflation of 4 or 5%,
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:00.000]   and we see inflation below that.
[00:06:00.000 --> 00:06:02.000]   And so that's what happened.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   So if you try to measure what's happened to the actual underlying rate of inflation,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:11.000]   it's down a little, maybe it's down half a percent,
[00:06:11.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   maybe it's down a percent.
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   That's more than I would have expected,
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   and that is genuinely good news.
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   But it's a long way from where we are now to a soft landing.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   And I think you've got risks on both sides.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   I think you've got risks that the consumer is going to slow down hard,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   that monetary policy operated with a lag,
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   that credit is going to be crunched,
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   and that you're going to see the economy have a bit the Wile E. Coyote aspect,
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   a bit the ball rolling off a table aspect.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   I think that risk is there.
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   I think there's a larger probably risk that we don't really have inflation on a secure path
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   down below 3.5% and that the Fed thinks it's got it under control,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   and it doesn't, and that it's going to have to go back to raising rates.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:23.000]   So Larry, if you were--
[00:07:23.000 --> 00:07:24.000]   I'm nervous.
[00:07:24.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Okay, you're nervous.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:28.000]   So if you're Jay Powell, if you had Jay Powell's job right now,
[00:07:28.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   what is the delta from what he's doing, what would you do differently, do you think?
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:40.000]   I thought Jay Powell was a million miles off course two years ago.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   I thought he was talking about zero interest rates until 2024.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:47.000]   He was talking about inflation being transitory.
[00:07:47.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   It was all on a different planet than the one that I thought I was seeing.
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   Starting about a year ago, he has recognized that the principal problem is inflation,
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   that the Fed was way behind the curve,
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   that he needed to focus on getting inflation back to target,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   and so my differences would be small and on tactics rather than large and fundamental.
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:30.000]   I think the Fed probably needs to be investing a bit more in its credibility
[00:08:30.000 --> 00:08:42.000]   by emphasizing that it's prepared to raise rates again if it doesn't see inflation decline.
[00:08:42.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   I think the Fed should be recognizing that the extraordinary size of the U.S. budget deficit
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   and where it is in prospect is going to complicate the macro policy task
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:04.000]   and should be more willing to call that out than it is.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   I think the Fed on matters relating to financial regulation
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:19.000]   should be giving more attention to market prices and the market values of assets
[00:09:19.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   and less to a variety of book value regulatory concepts than it tends to emphasize.
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   But again, I think that what we did in 2021 when the government basically infused $2.9 trillion
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   into a rapidly recovering economy
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   and when the Fed promised it was going to keep interest rates at zero till 2024
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   and when the Fed bought bonds on a massive scale, that put us way off course.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   Since then, we've been working our way on the monetary policy side back to course
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   in basically reasonable ways, but that doesn't mean if you get all the wrong answers
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   on the first third of the exam, you can do great on the second two parts,
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:27.000]   the second two thirds of the exam, and you still won't get a very good grade
[00:10:27.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   for the overall experience.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   So it's a hard problem.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.000]   My interpretation of what happened in 2021 is in Q1,
[00:10:34.000 --> 00:10:40.000]   they passed that $2 trillion American Rescue Plan, that last COVID relief bill.
[00:10:40.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   You absolutely nailed it by warning that this could set off inflation
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:48.000]   and the politics of that was that the administration, everyone who wanted the bill,
[00:10:48.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   basically said, "Oh, no, Larry doesn't know what he's talking about."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   They sort of poo-pooed your warnings.
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   And then sure enough, the inflation came that summer
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:59.000]   and that's when they almost, I think for political reasons,
[00:10:59.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   had to say it was transitory because they didn't want to admit that you had been right
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   and they had been wrong three months before.
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   And as a result of that, the Fed waited another nine months
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:10.000]   to start raising interest rates.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   And so everything got delayed.
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   They should have reacted back in the summer of 2021.
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   That's my interpretation of the politics.
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   Is the Fed political like that in terms of how they behave, to Sax's point?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   Are they thinking about the politics in the current administration
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.000]   or are they acting independently like they're supposed to?
[00:11:31.000 --> 00:11:36.000]   First of all, I think I'm a spectator and commentator,
[00:11:36.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   not the dominant actor by any stretch.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:47.000]   I'll leave it to others to speculate about everybody's motives.
[00:11:47.000 --> 00:11:55.000]   It's not only people in political situations who, when they develop a strong view,
[00:11:55.000 --> 00:12:00.000]   change it only slowly in response to evidence.
[00:12:00.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   I'm basically someone who mostly goes to Washington
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   and explains when I'm in Washington that there are limits to our knowledge
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   and limits to our competence.
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   And so it's often true that the best thing we can do is get out of the way.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   So I believe that.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:27.000]   But I also think that it's a mistake to think whenever anybody makes a judgment
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   that something doesn't turn out right in Washington,
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:35.000]   that it's because they had some bad political motive and were playing politics
[00:12:35.000 --> 00:12:40.000]   rather than they were using their best judgment and they turned out to be wrong.
[00:12:40.000 --> 00:12:44.000]   And like human beings in public environments,
[00:12:44.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   they change their mind slowly in the face of evidence.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   Look, there's a very broad thing.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:59.000]   And you all who work in companies experience it.
[00:12:59.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   You experience it in your personal lives.
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   We experience it in our relationships.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:11.000]   When something isn't going great, you always have to decide,
[00:13:11.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   is it that we need to give it time, persevere with what we think is right,
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:19.000]   double down and keep going,
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   or do we need to say we got this all screwed up, you need to suddenly change course.
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   And that's a decision we all are always making.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   And it's not that it's always the right thing to change course at the first hint of failure.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   And so I think a little more -- I think people obviously made bad decisions
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   and they kept making them and they made them too long and I was on the other side.
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:50.000]   But I think that it's a mistake, really a serious mistake,
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:58.000]   to go quite so quickly to motive.
[00:13:58.000 --> 00:14:03.000]   And I want to say one other thing just because I was struck by what came before.
[00:14:03.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   Look, I really do worry a lot about regulation.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:14.000]   But it's important to understand that the largest part of the good that cops do
[00:14:14.000 --> 00:14:19.000]   is not that they catch people breaking into houses
[00:14:19.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   or that they pull people away when they're trying to murder somebody.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:32.000]   The large reason why cops are good is because everybody knows that there are cops around
[00:14:32.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   and they commit far fewer crimes than they otherwise would.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   And therefore, evaluating the police only by the incidents
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   where the police are actively involved gets a judgment about crime wrong.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   And the same thing is true with respect to regulation.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   And we do need to recognize that all the things that we take for granted
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   that make this place a very different place to do business than Argentina
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:14.000]   and a much greater place to do business than it was 100 years ago
[00:15:14.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   have to do with institutions and regulations.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And so I think that's a perspective you all need to keep in mind.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   If there had not been major regulation that was regarded as oppressive,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   totalitarian, wrong, and anti-market beginning in the late 1940s,
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:44.000]   it would be impossible for this gathering to exist
[00:15:44.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   because the smog in Los Angeles would be so profoundly serious.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   Were there excesses? Was there craziness? Of course there was.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:16:03.000]   But let's also keep in mind that you need frameworks in which freedom can flourish.
[00:16:03.000 --> 00:16:06.000]   Let me ask you a basic question.
[00:16:06.000 --> 00:16:12.000]   We had Ray Dalio yesterday, and he was going over the arcs of history
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   and maybe America being past its peak in decline.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   And I'm curious what you think about the perhaps existential crisis for America
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.000]   in terms of our spending.
[00:16:25.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Trump added a trillion to the deficit.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:29.000]   Biden already four trillion.
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:31.000]   We've had this debate on the pod.
[00:16:31.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   Are we in an existential crisis in terms of how much we're spending,
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:36.000]   debt-to-GDP ratio?
[00:16:36.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   Is that the most acute issue for America?
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:43.000]   And then what are your thoughts about America on the global stage
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   versus other emerging powers, China and India?
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   There are a lot of parts to that question.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   I think the most important theme in American history is resilience.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:04.000]   I'm old enough--I'm not that old, but I'm old enough--
[00:17:04.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   I'm old compared to the people in this room, I guess--
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   but I'm old enough to remember when Jimmy Carter declared a crisis
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   of the national spirit and a pervasive malaise.
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:24.000]   I'm old enough to remember when the country was being torn apart
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:28.000]   by the Vietnam War, and the President of the United States
[00:17:28.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   couldn't go speak anywhere in the country, pretty much,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:41.000]   except on a military base and where there was gunfire on college campuses.
[00:17:41.000 --> 00:17:45.000]   I'm old enough to remember when--I'm not old enough to remember,
[00:17:45.000 --> 00:17:54.000]   but I've read about--when Joe McCarthy had the country in his thrall
[00:17:54.000 --> 00:18:02.000]   and people on university campuses were afraid to express progressive beliefs.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   If you read the history, almost everyone advised FDR in 1932
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   that he needed to use his inaugural address to declare dictatorial powers
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   to take the country over, to deal with the Depression
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:24.000]   because democracy wasn't up to it.
[00:18:24.000 --> 00:18:29.000]   Patrick Henry said in 1792--1792--
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:35.000]   that the spirit of the revolution had already been lost.
[00:18:35.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   So I think the theme in American history is the capacity for self-denying prophecy.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:50.000]   It is the capacity for the Jeremiads that generate all this alarm,
[00:18:50.000 --> 00:19:01.000]   that set in motion the processes which lead to renewal.
[00:19:01.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   And it won't be that way always.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   There'll come the end, just as there comes--
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   there's come the end for everything great historically.
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   But I'd rather be playing the hand of the United States
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:23.000]   than the hand that Xi Jinping is playing,
[00:19:23.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   than the hand that India is playing,
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   certainly than the hand that societies in Asia,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   where there are only going to be half as many people a century from now, are playing,
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   certainly than the societies of Western Europe.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:49.000]   That doesn't mean that those of us who are financially minded
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   don't need to be terribly, terribly concerned
[00:19:54.000 --> 00:20:01.000]   that the government's finances are not on a sustainable path
[00:20:01.000 --> 00:20:04.000]   and won't be on a sustainable path
[00:20:04.000 --> 00:20:08.000]   until we figure out how to raise the revenue
[00:20:08.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   that a society facing grave national security threats,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   an aging population,
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:21.000]   and a rising price of medical care and education
[00:20:21.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   relative to flat screen TVs and houses,
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   needs to finance its government.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   That doesn't mean that there aren't huge challenges
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   as well as opportunities associated with everything
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   that's coming out of information technology.
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:52.000]   That doesn't mean that I'm not fearful
[00:20:52.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   of so much that's happening in our educational system.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:06.000]   I think that we have in our educational system,
[00:21:06.000 --> 00:21:09.000]   and this is true of our great universities
[00:21:09.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   and it's true of our unionized elementary schools,
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   we have gone from thinking that self-esteem
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   comes from achievement
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   to thinking that achievement comes from self-esteem.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:37.000]   And that is a embarrassment
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   that the grade point average
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   of the average student at Harvard University
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   is above 3.7.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:52.000]   That by far the most common grade is A.
[00:21:52.000 --> 00:21:58.000]   And that the big education reform idea of the moment
[00:21:58.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   is to eliminate standardized tests
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:09.000]   that actually measure what people know.
[00:22:09.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   And so this kind of moves away
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:23.000]   from traditional values of excellence, achievement,
[00:22:23.000 --> 00:22:29.000]   the importance of learning,
[00:22:29.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   is something that I think is very much a problem.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:44.000]   So yeah, am I worried about the national sociology problem
[00:22:44.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   represented by the fact that we used to be a country
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   60 years ago where 4% of men between 25 and 54 were not working,
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   and now we're a country where 14% are not working
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:00.000]   at any point in time,
[00:23:00.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   and a quarter of them don't work for more than three months
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   within a two-year period?
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   Am I worried about that?
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   Yeah, I absolutely am.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   Am I worried about the finances?
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   Yes.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   Am I worried about our inadequate investment
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   in technology leadership?
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   Am I worried about a kind of broad constipation?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:31.000]   Many of you have probably been to Harvard Square.
[00:23:31.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   There's a bridge.
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:35.000]   The bridge goes over the Charles River.
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   It's 362 feet long.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:42.000]   It had been around for 100 years.
[00:23:42.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   It needed to be fixed.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:48.000]   It did need to be fixed.
[00:23:48.000 --> 00:23:53.000]   62 months, five years and two months,
[00:23:53.000 --> 00:23:56.000]   with one lane of traffic closed
[00:23:56.000 --> 00:24:01.000]   in order to renovate a 362-foot bridge.
[00:24:01.000 --> 00:24:03.000]   To put that in perspective,
[00:24:03.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   Patton built a bridge over the Rhine 3,000 feet in one day.
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:12.000]   [laughter]
[00:24:12.000 --> 00:24:17.000]   But there are better things about spending your life
[00:24:17.000 --> 00:24:19.000]   hanging around in a university,
[00:24:19.000 --> 00:24:23.000]   and so I wandered over to the Classics Department one day,
[00:24:23.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   and I learned that Julius Caesar,
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:32.000]   Julius Caesar built his bridge over the Rhine 3,000 feet,
[00:24:32.000 --> 00:24:36.000]   not 300 feet, in nine days.
[00:24:36.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   And this is what it took us.
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   So do we have huge problems?
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:41.000]   Yes.
[00:24:41.000 --> 00:24:44.000]   Is this the first time we've had huge problems?
[00:24:44.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Hell no.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:49.000]   Is there the prospect that we can solve those problems?
[00:24:49.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   Yes, I think there is.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:24:55.000]   Do I think we, all things considered,
[00:24:55.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   have a more solvable set of problems
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   and a more dynamic society for solving them?
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:08.000]   Yeah, I do, than the other places.
[00:25:08.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   [applause]
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   And never forget this,
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   even though we always forget it
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   when we make policy in the relevant area.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:18.000]   Larry, but before--
[00:25:18.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   The best--
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:20.000]   Let it come.
[00:25:20.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   The best test is we are the place
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:29.000]   that people from every part of the world want to come to.
[00:25:29.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   [applause]
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:34.000]   That is 100% true.
[00:25:34.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   I want to ask you a question.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   Let's just actually go to that quickly,
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:40.000]   which is you were the president of Harvard.
[00:25:40.000 --> 00:25:43.000]   There was a very, let's call it,
[00:25:43.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   important, divisive, foundational case
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   that just went through the Supreme Court
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   on affirmative action.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   You wrote, actually, a pretty interesting op-ed
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:53.000]   about all of this.
[00:25:53.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   Give us your thoughts about what is working
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   inside of higher education,
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   what you think about that ruling,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   just society in general as a reflection of that.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   I wish that ruling hadn't happened.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:11.000]   I wish that great universities were in a position
[00:26:11.000 --> 00:26:15.000]   to set their course and to compete with each other
[00:26:15.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   and to admit students as they saw fit.
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   But I think after that ruling,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:29.000]   it is clear what the right theme should be.
[00:26:29.000 --> 00:26:33.000]   And that theme is opportunity.
[00:26:33.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   The great strength of our universities
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   should be that they make it certain
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   that everyone has an opportunity
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:49.000]   to succeed and get to the top
[00:26:49.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   no matter where and what circumstances
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   that they were born.
[00:26:55.000 --> 00:26:57.000]   And I think there's much more
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:27:02.000]   that our great universities can do,
[00:27:02.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   and there are things that are much more important
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:09.000]   than arguing about diversity policies
[00:27:09.000 --> 00:27:11.000]   that could get us there.
[00:27:11.000 --> 00:27:14.000]   Here are some of them.
[00:27:14.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   Whatever the right way to think about this was
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:20.000]   40 years ago,
[00:27:20.000 --> 00:27:23.000]   the time for legacy admissions is over.
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   (applause)
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   Problem solved.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:35.000]   If there are scarce spots in our great universities,
[00:27:35.000 --> 00:27:41.000]   having your father hire a fantastic coach
[00:27:41.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   to teach you to play a country club sport
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   at an extraordinary level
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:51.000]   should not be a path to admission
[00:27:51.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   to our leading intellectual institutions.
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:58.000]   Let's end athletic recruiting
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:04.000]   for aristocratic sports.
[00:28:04.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   It's really a nice thing.
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   It's a nice thing, it's a good thing.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   It has a lot of good things
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   for most of the people in this room
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   that there exists early decision and early action.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   But it basically works to help the privileged,
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   and it basically prevents the underprivileged,
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:30.000]   less privileged,
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:33.000]   from shopping their financial aid offers
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   and getting the deals they should.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   We would not permit Goldman Sachs
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:42.000]   to make exploding offers to our MBA students.
[00:28:42.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Why should great colleges make exploding offers
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:28:51.000]   to admitted students?
[00:28:51.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   You guys, it's like the word,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:58.000]   I didn't really know until I got involved
[00:28:58.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   with Silicon Valley that scale was a verb
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   as distinct from a noun.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:06.000]   I thought it was something you kind of stepped on
[00:29:06.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   in the bathroom.
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:12.000]   If you think about it,
[00:29:12.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   any institution,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:19.000]   almost any other institution in the society,
[00:29:19.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   nearly a tenth as successful as Stanford or Harvard,
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   would have far more customers today
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   than it did 50 years ago.
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   And yet our universities have not grown
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:38.000]   their size of their students on campus,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   and they have moved only glacially
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   to use the incredible opportunities
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:52.000]   that technology presents to provide education,
[00:29:52.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   which, and this is what's remarkable
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   about educational technology if you think about it,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:03.000]   it can be much vaster scale,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:08.000]   and at the same time be much more personalized.
[00:30:08.000 --> 00:30:10.000]   You can go at your own pace, you can hit,
[00:30:10.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   you can hyperlink, you can go deeper
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:14.000]   in the things that you're interested in.
[00:30:14.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And so scale plus personalization
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:22.000]   creates incredible possibility.
[00:30:22.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   And our great universities have only scratched
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:30.000]   the surface of what's possible.
[00:30:30.000 --> 00:30:32.000]   So there's an immense amount they can do.
[00:30:32.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   - Last question because we're running out of time.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:36.000]   I just want to make sure you touch free speech on campuses
[00:30:36.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   and how it's actually affecting the rest of society as well.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:47.000]   - Look, vigorous argument
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:53.000]   in which all ideas can be put forward
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:31:00.000]   and in which no idea gains its authority
[00:31:00.000 --> 00:31:07.000]   from who said it or some fashion
[00:31:07.000 --> 00:31:11.000]   rather than its merit in open debate.
[00:31:11.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   That is the essence of liberal society.
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   That is the essence of great universities at their best.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   It is the essence of a great university at its best
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:25.000]   that when I was president of Harvard
[00:31:25.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   and I was teaching a freshman seminar,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   some freshman could come in and read my paper
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:33.000]   and explain how it was kind of an interesting paper
[00:31:33.000 --> 00:31:35.000]   by President Summers,
[00:31:35.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   but it was really pretty completely confused.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:41.000]   That was a fantastic thing.
[00:31:41.000 --> 00:31:44.000]   He wasn't right, but it was a fantastic thing.
[00:31:44.000 --> 00:31:48.000]   It was a fantastic thing.
[00:31:48.000 --> 00:31:53.000]   And yet so much of what we should be able
[00:31:53.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   to argue about and discuss is off limits.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:03.000]   Some of that is the speakers who get disinvited,
[00:32:03.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   and that's terrible,
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   but much more of it is a culture
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:13.000]   that there are only certain views you're allowed to have
[00:32:13.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   on questions about identity,
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   that there are only certain views you're allowed to have
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   on questions about markets and redistribution,
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:28.000]   that there are only certain views you're allowed to have
[00:32:28.000 --> 00:32:31.000]   about how children should be raised.
[00:32:31.000 --> 00:32:35.000]   There shouldn't be any views you're not allowed to have.
[00:32:35.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   [applause]
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Let that happen.
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Academic freedom should be an absolute,
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:50.000]   but academic freedom does not mean freedom from criticism.
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Freedom from debate, freedom from challenge.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:59.000]   That is the essence of the most successful human institutions,
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   and our universities should be modeling and demonstrating
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   that rather than leading a charge,
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:10.000]   as it too often seems they are,
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   towards an orgy of mutual self-regard,
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   respect, and care,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:21.000]   rather than getting closer to the truth
[00:33:21.000 --> 00:33:23.000]   in the most excellent way.
[00:33:23.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   [applause]
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   [music]
[00:33:30.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   [applause]
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:37.000]   [music]
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:40.000]   [applause]
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   [music]
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   [applause]
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:52.000]   [music]
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   [applause]
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.200]   What your winner is like?
[00:33:58.200 --> 00:34:00.120]   What your winner is like?
[00:34:00.120 --> 00:34:01.340]   Bestie's are gone.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:02.400]   (laughing)
[00:34:02.400 --> 00:34:02.860]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.780]   - That's my dog taking a piss in your driveway.
[00:34:04.780 --> 00:34:05.340]   (laughing)
[00:34:05.340 --> 00:34:07.780]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:08.720]   - Oh man.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:10.440]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:11.500]   - We should all just get a room
[00:34:11.500 --> 00:34:13.060]   and just have one big huge orgy
[00:34:13.060 --> 00:34:14.240]   'cause we're all confused.
[00:34:14.240 --> 00:34:15.940]   It's like this sexual tension
[00:34:15.940 --> 00:34:17.980]   but we just need to release them now.
[00:34:17.980 --> 00:34:20.220]   - What your a b?
[00:34:20.220 --> 00:34:21.420]   What your a b?
[00:34:21.420 --> 00:34:22.680]   - What your a b?
[00:34:22.680 --> 00:34:23.640]   - That's gonna be good.
[00:34:23.640 --> 00:34:24.500]   We need to get merged--
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.440]   - Bestie's are back.
[00:34:25.440 --> 00:34:28.020]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:28.020 --> 00:34:30.600]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:30.600 --> 00:34:33.180]   (upbeat music)
[00:34:33.180 --> 00:34:35.180]   I'm doing all of it
[00:34:35.180 --> 00:34:38.540]   [WHOOSH]
