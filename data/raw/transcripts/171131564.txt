[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.440]   If you can turn your Bibles to Romans chapter 5, and I'm going to read from verse 12 to
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.920]   verse 17.
[00:00:12.920 --> 00:00:18.640]   Romans chapter 5, verse 12 through 17.
[00:00:18.640 --> 00:00:24.760]   "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin, and
[00:00:24.760 --> 00:00:28.060]   so death spread to all men because all sinned.
[00:00:28.060 --> 00:00:32.600]   For sin indeed was in the world before the law was given, but sin is not counted where
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.320]   there is no law.
[00:00:34.320 --> 00:00:39.500]   Yet death reigned from Adam to Moses, even over those whose sinning was not like the
[00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:43.720]   transgression of Adam, who was a type of the one who was to come.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:48.640]   But the free gift is not like the trespass, for if many died through one man's trespass,
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.040]   much more have the grace of God and the free gift by the grace of that one man, Jesus Christ,
[00:00:53.040 --> 00:00:54.040]   abounded for many.
[00:00:54.040 --> 00:00:57.840]   And the free gift is not like the result of that one man's sin.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:01:02.240]   For the judgment following one trespass brought condemnation, but the free gift following
[00:01:02.240 --> 00:01:05.200]   many trespasses brought justification.
[00:01:05.200 --> 00:01:09.960]   For if because of one man's trespass, death reigned through that one man, much more will
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:14.320]   those who receive the abundance of grace and the free gift of righteousness reign in life
[00:01:14.320 --> 00:01:16.360]   through the one man, Jesus Christ."
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:18.200]   Let's pray.
[00:01:18.200 --> 00:01:21.480]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:01:21.480 --> 00:01:26.080]   We pray, Lord God, that your word would go forth and that it would convict our hearts.
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:30.360]   Help us, Lord God, to understand the depth of your grace and love in us, that all our
[00:01:30.360 --> 00:01:34.960]   lives, Lord God, our mind and our heart, all of it, Lord, may be thoroughly gripped by
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.380]   who you are and what you've done.
[00:01:37.380 --> 00:01:40.680]   So we pray for your help and the Holy Spirit to lead and guide so that we may understand.
[00:01:40.680 --> 00:01:44.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:44.840 --> 00:01:49.040]   I think some of you guys may know if you've been hearing me preach for a while that you
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.360]   know that U2 was one of my bands that I liked when I was younger.
[00:01:54.360 --> 00:01:55.360]   I know they're still around.
[00:01:55.360 --> 00:01:57.760]   They've been around for what, three decades or something?
[00:01:57.760 --> 00:02:00.720]   And when I was younger U2 had a lot of songs.
[00:02:00.720 --> 00:02:05.200]   And part of the reason why I was intrigued is because supposedly they started out kind
[00:02:05.200 --> 00:02:06.200]   of like a Christian band.
[00:02:06.200 --> 00:02:10.000]   So if you listen carefully to their lyrics, there's some Christian theme in it.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:14.720]   But it's very confusing because they backslid for decades and then Bono ended up recently
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.520]   started coming back and talking about his faith.
[00:02:17.520 --> 00:02:21.640]   But if you listen to a lot of the early songs, it has some Christian themes kind of mixed
[00:02:21.640 --> 00:02:22.640]   up.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:25.240]   It's like you could tell he's a mixed up Christian.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:26.240]   Whoever wrote the songs.
[00:02:26.240 --> 00:02:30.320]   One of the songs that kind of stood out to me as I was preparing this message was the
[00:02:30.320 --> 00:02:32.720]   song titled Pride.
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:35.560]   And the lyrics go like this, and some of you guys may know the songs.
[00:02:35.560 --> 00:02:37.840]   "One man come in the name of love.
[00:02:37.840 --> 00:02:38.960]   One man come and go.
[00:02:38.960 --> 00:02:41.720]   One man come he to justify.
[00:02:41.720 --> 00:02:43.960]   And one man to overthrow.
[00:02:43.960 --> 00:02:46.120]   In the name of love, what more in the name of love?
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:49.180]   In the name of love, what more in the name of love?
[00:02:49.180 --> 00:02:51.380]   One man caught on a barbed wire fence.
[00:02:51.380 --> 00:02:52.720]   One man he resist.
[00:02:52.720 --> 00:02:54.840]   One man washed up on an empty beach.
[00:02:54.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   One man betrayed with a kiss.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.920]   In the name of love, what more in the name of love?
[00:02:58.920 --> 00:03:02.440]   In the name of love, what more in the name of love?"
[00:03:02.440 --> 00:03:06.240]   Now that we have Google, I've always wondered, what does he mean by this?
[00:03:06.240 --> 00:03:07.800]   Now that we have Google, we can just type it up.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:08.800]   What does he mean by this?
[00:03:08.800 --> 00:03:12.040]   And all kinds of sites come up and tell you.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.880]   And I found out what the lyrics mean behind it.
[00:03:14.880 --> 00:03:19.100]   And immediately, if you look at it superficially, it sounds like he's talking about Jesus.
[00:03:19.100 --> 00:03:21.800]   And there are some clear reference to that.
[00:03:21.800 --> 00:03:26.600]   That's a one man come to justify, and one man betrayed with a kiss.
[00:03:26.600 --> 00:03:29.160]   Clearly that must be a reference to Christ.
[00:03:29.160 --> 00:03:35.600]   But the author of the song basically explains that the song was predominantly written about
[00:03:35.600 --> 00:03:37.920]   Martin Luther King Jr.
[00:03:37.920 --> 00:03:39.400]   And it wasn't just about him.
[00:03:39.400 --> 00:03:44.920]   He said that the song basically is about how one man can be so powerful that he can change
[00:03:44.920 --> 00:03:47.240]   the world, or he can feed the poor and do all of this.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:51.640]   And how Martin Luther King Jr. representing the Civil Rights Movement and how he made
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:55.720]   such an impact in our culture.
[00:03:55.720 --> 00:03:58.040]   Now that sounds great.
[00:03:58.040 --> 00:03:59.240]   That sounds great.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:05.160]   But in history, I can only think of two people who had that kind of effect on mankind.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:06.160]   Two people.
[00:04:06.160 --> 00:04:08.200]   And those two people are mentioned in this text.
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:12.640]   No matter how much we try to venerate Martin Luther King Jr., he was not the only guy.
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:15.960]   He just happens to be the most noted person.
[00:04:15.960 --> 00:04:21.680]   There's plenty of civil rights leaders prior to him, during his time, and even after.
[00:04:21.680 --> 00:04:27.880]   We think about the Reformation, typically Martin Luther, the Martin Luther of the Reformation,
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:31.280]   the monk, say, "Oh, he sparked the Reformation."
[00:04:31.280 --> 00:04:35.400]   But if you study the Reformation carefully, you'll know that there are many, countless
[00:04:35.400 --> 00:04:40.200]   number of people who gave their lives that created the foundation for the spark of the
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:41.200]   Reformation.
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:44.680]   So, he just happens to be the name that everybody knows.
[00:04:44.680 --> 00:04:48.000]   But there's no way that it was just one man.
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.560]   But when it comes to history, there's two particular people that literally had an impact
[00:04:53.560 --> 00:04:55.280]   on human history.
[00:04:55.280 --> 00:04:59.280]   And every single human being has been affected in some way or another because of these two
[00:04:59.280 --> 00:05:00.280]   people.
[00:05:00.280 --> 00:05:06.920]   And obviously, the two people that we are referring to is Adam and Jesus Christ.
[00:05:06.920 --> 00:05:11.080]   Adam is introduced to us in verse 14, saying, "Adam, who was a type of the one who was to
[00:05:11.080 --> 00:05:12.080]   come."
[00:05:12.080 --> 00:05:14.320]   That Adam was a type of Christ.
[00:05:14.320 --> 00:05:19.360]   Now, when the Bible, in theology, when we talk about types, we're talking about something
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:24.760]   that is outlined for us in the Old Testament, kind of like a shadow.
[00:05:24.760 --> 00:05:28.280]   And the reality is fulfilled in the New Testament.
[00:05:28.280 --> 00:05:34.880]   So we can say the tabernacle, the sacrifices, those were the types of Christ to try to teach
[00:05:34.880 --> 00:05:39.520]   that there needed to be blood sacrifice in order for sins to be atoned.
[00:05:39.520 --> 00:05:44.080]   The high priesthood, that was a type preparing for Christ, that he was going to come, he's
[00:05:44.080 --> 00:05:48.200]   going to be the priest, and he's going to be the king.
[00:05:48.200 --> 00:05:51.960]   Jonah also was a type of Christ, where he goes into the valley for three days and comes
[00:05:51.960 --> 00:05:52.960]   back.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.160]   Again, a type of Jesus in his death and resurrection.
[00:05:55.160 --> 00:05:59.940]   So there are all kinds of types in the Old Testament that is fulfilled in the New Testament.
[00:05:59.940 --> 00:06:05.200]   But in this particular instance, in reference to Adam and Jesus, they actually use the term
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   "type."
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   Right?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:11.640]   Just in case you don't see the connection, Paul is trying to make that clear connection
[00:06:11.640 --> 00:06:16.160]   that Adam was a foreshadowing of what he is about to say.
[00:06:16.160 --> 00:06:20.480]   Now the reason why he introduces this, he's been talking about justification by faith
[00:06:20.480 --> 00:06:25.700]   and how because of that, our sins have been forgiven, we've been reconciled with God,
[00:06:25.700 --> 00:06:27.500]   we have new life in Him, right?
[00:06:27.500 --> 00:06:28.640]   The wrath of God has been taken away.
[00:06:28.640 --> 00:06:34.400]   So all the benefits of justification that we receive because of Jesus' sacrifice.
[00:06:34.400 --> 00:06:40.600]   So the question is, if all mankind has been affected by what Jesus has done, how can that
[00:06:40.600 --> 00:06:45.480]   possibly happen by one act, by one person?
[00:06:45.480 --> 00:06:52.120]   Again, because we're raised in the Church, oftentimes we don't ask critical questions.
[00:06:52.120 --> 00:06:55.680]   And we just kind of assume, "Yeah, Jesus died for me, died for me on the cross."
[00:06:55.680 --> 00:07:02.160]   But again, as a Jew who is listening to this for the first time, in their sacrificial system,
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.000]   they had to give sacrifices over and over and over for every sin that they commit.
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:14.700]   Even the Day of Atonement, that has to happen every single year.
[00:07:14.700 --> 00:07:19.760]   So the question that they were having was, if Jesus' death and sacrifice was once and
[00:07:19.760 --> 00:07:26.000]   for all cleared our sins, how can that one act from one man do such a thing?
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:31.220]   So Paul is trying to answer this question by introducing Adam because they already knew
[00:07:31.220 --> 00:07:33.580]   that they were on their sin because of Adam.
[00:07:33.580 --> 00:07:39.540]   So what Paul is trying to do is illustrate the power of Jesus' one act on the cross in
[00:07:39.540 --> 00:07:43.220]   comparison to Adam's one act of rebellion.
[00:07:43.220 --> 00:07:45.420]   One act of rebellion.
[00:07:45.420 --> 00:07:49.940]   So again, if we're engaged and we're really thinking through the Gospel, and we're talking
[00:07:49.940 --> 00:07:56.780]   about original sin, how Adam, because of his sins, it affected all mankind.
[00:07:56.780 --> 00:07:59.700]   Now how can that be fair?
[00:07:59.700 --> 00:08:03.780]   We're not talking about Adam who sinned for many years to come.
[00:08:03.780 --> 00:08:05.660]   We're not talking about a generation of sin.
[00:08:05.660 --> 00:08:11.060]   We're talking about one man with one sin.
[00:08:11.060 --> 00:08:19.500]   And because of that one sin, all mankind has become corrupt and is deserving of death.
[00:08:19.500 --> 00:08:25.220]   It's hard for us to comprehend because we typically think of sin as a mistake, we've
[00:08:25.220 --> 00:08:29.020]   fallen short, it's a compromise.
[00:08:29.020 --> 00:08:33.660]   But what this reveals to us is God's view of sin.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:42.900]   Now years ago, Wendy's, it's probably been over 20 years, but Wendy's had a big scandal
[00:08:42.900 --> 00:08:44.700]   because somebody was eating their chili.
[00:08:44.700 --> 00:08:48.380]   I don't know if you've ever eaten their chili, it's delicious.
[00:08:48.380 --> 00:08:54.380]   If you eat their chili, they found a little mouse's head inside the chili.
[00:08:54.380 --> 00:08:58.840]   And initially you can't tell, but you look closely, you can see the mouse in the chili.
[00:08:58.840 --> 00:09:04.300]   And after that came out, obviously, I love their chili, but after I saw that picture,
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:07.820]   I just could not go to Wendy's anymore.
[00:09:07.820 --> 00:09:11.780]   And nobody went, I don't know anybody, you go to Wendy's, it's wide open.
[00:09:11.780 --> 00:09:15.060]   There was a period when Wendy's was ruined for a while.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:22.380]   But logically speaking, they probably sold tons and tons of chili every single day.
[00:09:22.380 --> 00:09:28.060]   So that little rat's head, logically speaking, is probably not even .0001% of whatever is
[00:09:28.060 --> 00:09:30.820]   that they had.
[00:09:30.820 --> 00:09:35.260]   But nobody's going to say, "Ah, it's just one little mice."
[00:09:35.260 --> 00:09:40.980]   The thought of that mice in the chili, even if it is a minuscule percentage of that, ruined
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.580]   the whole thing.
[00:09:42.580 --> 00:09:46.060]   And not only did they not eat the chili, they wouldn't eat their hamburgers.
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:47.980]   I don't trust their fries.
[00:09:47.980 --> 00:09:51.460]   Who knows what's in their Coca-Cola?
[00:09:51.460 --> 00:09:56.420]   So that one little thing in that chili ruined it for everybody for a long period of time.
[00:09:56.420 --> 00:10:02.140]   It's been 20-some years, I've had many chilis since then.
[00:10:02.140 --> 00:10:04.900]   It's been a long time, I'm over it.
[00:10:04.900 --> 00:10:11.660]   But the idea of something as disgusting as a mouse in something that I'm going to put
[00:10:11.660 --> 00:10:17.580]   in my mouth is enough to keep a whole generation of people everywhere away from anything that
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:19.540]   they sell.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:23.500]   The reason why we have a hard time understanding God's wrath upon mankind is because we don't
[00:10:23.500 --> 00:10:26.380]   see sin in that way.
[00:10:26.380 --> 00:10:29.980]   We don't see sin the way God sees sin.
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:38.380]   So when we talk about that if one sin of that man brought corruption to mankind, consider,
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:44.460]   consider since then how many sins that even just Adam committed.
[00:10:44.460 --> 00:10:48.580]   Consider the generations that came after him, whether you believe in the old earth or the
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:54.220]   young earth, for thousands and thousands of years, sins committed over and over.
[00:10:54.220 --> 00:11:02.260]   Let's just think about even just in this room, even just this week, our sins, our sins outnumber
[00:11:02.260 --> 00:11:07.900]   that Adam's one sin probably by a hundredfold, maybe a thousandfold.
[00:11:07.900 --> 00:11:12.140]   And so when the scripture talks about because that one man's sin, it brought corruption
[00:11:12.140 --> 00:11:18.060]   to mankind even up to this day, how much more when the scripture talks about the wrath of
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:23.060]   God being stored up in the last days.
[00:11:23.060 --> 00:11:28.700]   If everything that you and I have seen, the corruption that you and I have experienced,
[00:11:28.700 --> 00:11:31.340]   even just last night, I don't know some of you guys may have watched the news, another
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:37.460]   crazy gunman went into a nightclub in Florida and killed 50 people, wounded another 50.
[00:11:37.460 --> 00:11:40.680]   So if you haven't seen it when you go home, it's kind of probably going to be the top
[00:11:40.680 --> 00:11:42.980]   of the news today.
[00:11:42.980 --> 00:11:46.540]   I mean you almost get numb to it because you just expect it, oh another one, another one
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:47.940]   did that.
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:53.020]   But if you compare that in human history, it's just a blip, right?
[00:11:53.020 --> 00:11:57.180]   I mean we're horrified because it's closer to us, but I mean if you look at human history,
[00:11:57.180 --> 00:12:02.180]   human history is filled with violence and rape and murder.
[00:12:02.180 --> 00:12:09.220]   Imagine if that one man's sin brought corruption to mankind deserving of eternal death, when
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:17.340]   the Bible says that the wrath of God is being stored up for all of sin of mankind, I believe
[00:12:17.340 --> 00:12:20.860]   hell would make a lot more sense.
[00:12:20.860 --> 00:12:25.020]   We have a hard time with the concept of hell being eternal and torment, because we don't
[00:12:25.020 --> 00:12:27.940]   see sin the way God sees sin.
[00:12:27.940 --> 00:12:34.660]   See, the point that he's trying to make here is that because of Adam's sin, that all mankind
[00:12:34.660 --> 00:12:40.100]   was tainted, and you and I were inheritors of what has been tainted.
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:45.100]   Now, every human being is connected to the previous generation, right?
[00:12:45.100 --> 00:12:51.060]   I know that I have, I've had asthma and I have asthma, my father had asthma, my uncle
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:58.900]   had asthma, and so I found out that generationally that our, my father's line, you know, our
[00:12:58.900 --> 00:13:03.340]   ancestors, we have bad lungs, you know?
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:04.660]   It's been passed down.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:10.420]   And again, our physical deficiencies and decay, it's just a reminder of the corruption of
[00:13:10.420 --> 00:13:14.700]   man, it's not just physical because God didn't create us that way.
[00:13:14.700 --> 00:13:19.420]   God didn't create us to have heart disease, and God didn't create us to have cancer.
[00:13:19.420 --> 00:13:22.580]   All of that happened at the fall.
[00:13:22.580 --> 00:13:29.500]   And so, these things are reminders to us that all mankind is under this sin.
[00:13:29.500 --> 00:13:35.500]   You know, up to this point, we've been studying about how God's love is so high and so rich
[00:13:35.500 --> 00:13:39.220]   that even while we were still weak and we couldn't do anything, even while though we
[00:13:39.220 --> 00:13:45.700]   were sinners, even while we were yet enemies of God, God sent His only begotten Son to
[00:13:45.700 --> 00:13:48.100]   die for our sins.
[00:13:48.100 --> 00:13:51.580]   So the more we dig, the more amazing this love is.
[00:13:51.580 --> 00:13:56.780]   But what Paul is doing now is he's digging deeper just to see how deep this love is.
[00:13:56.780 --> 00:14:01.940]   Because he said that while we were yet sinners, but what does it mean?
[00:14:01.940 --> 00:14:05.780]   Because when we say you're a sinner, I'm a sinner, it impacts different people, different
[00:14:05.780 --> 00:14:06.780]   ways.
[00:14:06.780 --> 00:14:12.860]   Some of you who are weighed down by sin are filled with guilt and looking for some way
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:14.540]   out and looking for grace.
[00:14:14.540 --> 00:14:17.980]   Some of you, when you talk about sin, it's like, "Oh yeah, yeah, of course, you know,
[00:14:17.980 --> 00:14:18.980]   everybody does it.
[00:14:18.980 --> 00:14:19.980]   Where do you draw the line?"
[00:14:19.980 --> 00:14:21.860]   And everybody kind of in between.
[00:14:21.860 --> 00:14:24.820]   We have varying attitudes towards sin.
[00:14:24.820 --> 00:14:29.900]   And depending on how you are affected by sin in your life, you will be affected by the
[00:14:29.900 --> 00:14:34.580]   grace that God talks about.
[00:14:34.580 --> 00:14:38.980]   When the Bible says that while we were yet sinners, He reached down and got us, what
[00:14:38.980 --> 00:14:43.340]   Paul is trying to convey is just how deep this sin goes.
[00:14:43.340 --> 00:14:45.660]   That it wasn't just you.
[00:14:45.660 --> 00:14:49.540]   That this, your sins that you're wrestling with, was passed down from your parents and
[00:14:49.540 --> 00:14:50.540]   you could probably see.
[00:14:50.540 --> 00:14:55.400]   So one of the things that we always talk about in marriage counseling is talking about how
[00:14:55.400 --> 00:14:59.960]   some things that you notice in the previous generation that you don't want to repeat.
[00:14:59.960 --> 00:15:04.100]   Because that's always a temptation for all of us because we naturally just tend to act
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:05.460]   the way our parents acted.
[00:15:05.460 --> 00:15:08.940]   No matter how much you say, "I'm not going to be like that."
[00:15:08.940 --> 00:15:12.780]   And they did that because of their previous generation.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.380]   How far does this sin go?
[00:15:14.380 --> 00:15:19.100]   Well, Psalm 51.3 says, "Behold, I was brought forth in iniquity, and in sin did my mother
[00:15:19.100 --> 00:15:24.700]   conceive me, even before I was ever even born in my parents."
[00:15:24.700 --> 00:15:29.580]   Psalm 58.3, "The wicked are estranged from the womb, and they go astray from birth, speaking
[00:15:29.580 --> 00:15:30.580]   lies from day one."
[00:15:30.580 --> 00:15:34.540]   You know, we look at little babies and say, "Oh, they're so innocent."
[00:15:34.540 --> 00:15:39.300]   And yet, the psalmist say, "They come out as sinners.
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.900]   They come corrupted."
[00:15:40.900 --> 00:15:43.780]   How far does this corruption go?
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.500]   All the way up to Adam.
[00:15:46.500 --> 00:15:48.460]   That's how deep this sin is.
[00:15:48.460 --> 00:15:49.460]   Right?
[00:15:49.460 --> 00:15:53.260]   I mean, our family are not known to be tall.
[00:15:53.260 --> 00:15:54.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:15:54.260 --> 00:15:56.140]   So it's been passed down from generation to generation.
[00:15:56.140 --> 00:16:00.820]   I can't just one day say, "I'm sick of this.
[00:16:00.820 --> 00:16:02.660]   I'm going to be six feet tall."
[00:16:02.660 --> 00:16:05.100]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:06.380]   Obviously, that's ridiculous.
[00:16:06.380 --> 00:16:09.780]   It's almost comical for me to just one day decide, "I'm not going to be this."
[00:16:09.780 --> 00:16:10.780]   Right?
[00:16:10.780 --> 00:16:15.460]   It is equally ridiculous for an individual who's been seeped in sin from generation to
[00:16:15.460 --> 00:16:20.300]   generation, all of human history, and all of a sudden, one day say, "I'm sick of it."
[00:16:20.300 --> 00:16:24.980]   See, what Paul is trying to convey is just how deep this sin goes.
[00:16:24.980 --> 00:16:27.340]   Just how corrupt this nature is.
[00:16:27.340 --> 00:16:31.940]   You know, yesterday, we were talking about what's going on with this building.
[00:16:31.940 --> 00:16:35.620]   I'm going to make a little bit of an announcement at the end of the service, asking some of
[00:16:35.620 --> 00:16:37.780]   you to come out to the hearing that's taking place tomorrow.
[00:16:37.780 --> 00:16:38.780]   I'll explain a little bit.
[00:16:38.780 --> 00:16:45.180]   But I was on the phone with the real estate agent of the buyers of this building.
[00:16:45.180 --> 00:16:46.180]   People are protesting.
[00:16:46.180 --> 00:16:50.220]   We're going to have a hearing tomorrow to see if the city is going to approve them purchasing
[00:16:50.220 --> 00:16:51.220]   this building.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:52.220]   So he was kind of distraught.
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:53.220]   We're going back and forth.
[00:16:53.220 --> 00:16:54.500]   You know, why are they doing this?
[00:16:54.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   Is it logical?
[00:16:55.500 --> 00:16:56.500]   They're creating headache.
[00:16:56.500 --> 00:16:59.580]   And they're concerned that, you know, we don't want to sell to them.
[00:16:59.580 --> 00:17:02.340]   We're concerned that they're going to walk away.
[00:17:02.340 --> 00:17:05.140]   And at the end of it, I could clearly tell that he wasn't a Christian, because he was
[00:17:05.140 --> 00:17:12.220]   using all kinds of colorful language, you know, in between calling me pastor.
[00:17:12.220 --> 00:17:15.380]   And so he was just very frustrated.
[00:17:15.380 --> 00:17:17.360]   He was angry with what's going on.
[00:17:17.360 --> 00:17:18.860]   And so we're trying to get on the same page.
[00:17:18.860 --> 00:17:19.860]   What are you going to say?
[00:17:19.860 --> 00:17:20.860]   How are you going to say it?
[00:17:20.860 --> 00:17:21.860]   And going back and forth.
[00:17:21.860 --> 00:17:23.620]   And at the end of the conversation, you could hear him just sighing.
[00:17:23.620 --> 00:17:27.380]   He said, hey, you're a man of the cloth, right?
[00:17:27.380 --> 00:17:28.900]   Meaning you wear cloth.
[00:17:28.900 --> 00:17:29.900]   I don't know what that means.
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:33.980]   Like you're a man of the cloth, right?
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:36.820]   And so he was kind of asking, so what sense do you get?
[00:17:36.820 --> 00:17:38.980]   Like something supernatural that I don't know.
[00:17:38.980 --> 00:17:41.420]   You have some tap into this, right?
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.660]   So I thought, okay.
[00:17:42.660 --> 00:17:45.820]   So he's looking for some guidance because he's distraught.
[00:17:45.820 --> 00:17:49.540]   So I thought it would be a good opportunity for me to at least introduce the gospel to
[00:17:49.540 --> 00:17:50.740]   him.
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:56.700]   So we're on the phone talking and I said, hey, I think the way we should approach it
[00:17:56.700 --> 00:18:01.060]   is this, because Christianity teaches, the gospel teaches that all have sinned and fall
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:02.900]   short of the glory of God.
[00:18:02.900 --> 00:18:07.140]   And what that means is all man's inner being is corrupt.
[00:18:07.140 --> 00:18:12.460]   So our primary motivation of why we're doing is self-preservation, is self-glorification,
[00:18:12.460 --> 00:18:14.320]   is self-preservation.
[00:18:14.320 --> 00:18:21.140]   And so the point of the gospel is that Christ came to deliver us from a tainted position
[00:18:21.140 --> 00:18:23.420]   that we're in, of sinfulness.
[00:18:23.420 --> 00:18:28.060]   So we didn't get to finish the conversation, so I told him, so therefore when we're approaching
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:34.100]   the council, don't pound too much about what is right and what is wrong, right?
[00:18:34.100 --> 00:18:35.100]   We need to say that.
[00:18:35.100 --> 00:18:36.100]   We need to tell him that.
[00:18:36.100 --> 00:18:41.000]   But let's emphasize how this is going to benefit them.
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.820]   You know, so I was talking to him about, hey, they made the mistake and everybody's angry
[00:18:43.820 --> 00:18:46.140]   and this is going to relieve pressure for you guys.
[00:18:46.140 --> 00:18:50.180]   So if you don't approve this, you know, this is actually beneficial for you.
[00:18:50.180 --> 00:18:54.180]   For the city, it'll be beneficial for you guys, since you guys blew it with that building,
[00:18:54.180 --> 00:18:55.760]   now you can redeem yourself with this building.
[00:18:55.760 --> 00:18:59.500]   So we were talking to say, let's do that, because all have sinned and fall short of
[00:18:59.500 --> 00:19:00.500]   the glory of God.
[00:19:00.500 --> 00:19:08.700]   I mean, dead silence on the phone, it's like, what are you talking about?
[00:19:08.700 --> 00:19:12.020]   So I said, hey, let's talk more, you know, we'll have other opportunities.
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:15.260]   So I just kind of planted the seed, you know.
[00:19:15.260 --> 00:19:17.340]   But at the core of it, that's exactly what Paul is doing.
[00:19:17.340 --> 00:19:22.100]   What Paul is doing is, he's trying to get everybody on the same page to understand just
[00:19:22.100 --> 00:19:27.300]   how deep the sin goes.
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:30.740]   But the next question that may come up if we talk about original sin is, how can that
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.500]   be fair?
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:36.020]   Why would we be punished because of the sin of Adam?
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:41.700]   Clearly, Ezekiel 18.20 said, "The soul who sins shall die.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:46.060]   The son shall not suffer for the iniquity of the father, nor the father suffer for the
[00:19:46.060 --> 00:19:47.780]   iniquity of the son.
[00:19:47.780 --> 00:19:51.260]   The righteousness of the righteous shall be upon himself, and the wickedness of the wicked
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:53.300]   shall be upon himself."
[00:19:53.300 --> 00:19:54.300]   You hear that?
[00:19:54.300 --> 00:19:59.700]   It made it clear in Ezekiel 18.20 that you are not being punished for the sin of your
[00:19:59.700 --> 00:20:02.440]   parents or your grandparents.
[00:20:02.440 --> 00:20:06.660]   So how do we understand this when it says Adam's sin was imputed to us?
[00:20:06.660 --> 00:20:11.060]   So if you look at verse 12, I think it gives, it kind of gives us some guidelines as to
[00:20:11.060 --> 00:20:13.860]   how do we understand this tension in verse 12.
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.900]   "Therefore, just as sin came into the world through one man, and death through sin."
[00:20:18.900 --> 00:20:19.900]   Right?
[00:20:19.900 --> 00:20:20.900]   That's imputed sin.
[00:20:20.900 --> 00:20:21.900]   Right?
[00:20:21.900 --> 00:20:22.900]   We're guilty.
[00:20:22.900 --> 00:20:28.580]   But then the second part of it, it says, "And so death spread to all men, because all sinned."
[00:20:28.580 --> 00:20:29.980]   Right?
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:35.100]   So in other words, are we sinners because we sin, or are we, do we sin because we're
[00:20:35.100 --> 00:20:37.780]   sinners?
[00:20:37.780 --> 00:20:41.140]   And the answer to that is yes.
[00:20:41.140 --> 00:20:42.660]   Both.
[00:20:42.660 --> 00:20:50.140]   See, no man is guilty simply because of the sin of the previous generation.
[00:20:50.140 --> 00:20:51.140]   Right?
[00:20:51.140 --> 00:20:55.660]   And even though that sin had been imputed, everyone is guilty by their own sins.
[00:20:55.660 --> 00:20:57.700]   That's what he says in verse 12.
[00:20:57.700 --> 00:21:03.940]   So we sin because we're sinners, and we are sinners because we sin.
[00:21:03.940 --> 00:21:07.660]   He goes even further than that in verse 4.13, he says, "For sin indeed was in the world
[00:21:07.660 --> 00:21:11.900]   before the law was given, but sin is not counted where there is no law."
[00:21:11.900 --> 00:21:12.900]   Right?
[00:21:12.900 --> 00:21:15.660]   And somebody may read that and say, "Huh, okay, then I don't want the law.
[00:21:15.660 --> 00:21:21.260]   As long as I don't have the law, we're not Jews, so therefore we're not guilty of sin."
[00:21:21.260 --> 00:21:22.260]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:21:22.260 --> 00:21:23.260]   Right?
[00:21:23.260 --> 00:21:26.100]   Don't shake your head like this, because that would be heresy.
[00:21:26.100 --> 00:21:27.100]   Right?
[00:21:27.100 --> 00:21:28.100]   Is that what he's saying?
[00:21:28.100 --> 00:21:32.220]   Of course that's not what he's saying, because he spent the first three, four chapters trying
[00:21:32.220 --> 00:21:36.060]   to explain, "If you have the law, you're guilty with the law.
[00:21:36.060 --> 00:21:38.660]   If you don't have the law, you're guilty without the law."
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:42.140]   So there's no way he's saying now, "Those who don't have the law, all your sins don't
[00:21:42.140 --> 00:21:43.140]   count."
[00:21:43.140 --> 00:21:44.140]   Okay?
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:46.660]   Let me explain what he is trying to say.
[00:21:46.660 --> 00:21:51.620]   What he is trying to say is that when the law came, that they began to keep record of
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:52.620]   sin.
[00:21:52.620 --> 00:21:56.180]   It's kind of like, you know, if you say, "Well, who's the greatest basketball player today?"
[00:21:56.180 --> 00:21:57.260]   And there's always a debate.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:21:59.820]   Was it LeBron James?
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:00.820]   You know?
[00:22:00.820 --> 00:22:02.820]   Was it, you know, was it Steph Curry?
[00:22:02.820 --> 00:22:05.140]   Was it Magic Johnson?
[00:22:05.140 --> 00:22:08.020]   You notice how people don't talk about Kobe Bryant anymore?
[00:22:08.020 --> 00:22:09.820]   Like ten days after he retires, like he's gone.
[00:22:09.820 --> 00:22:10.820]   Right?
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:11.820]   Is it Kobe Bryant?
[00:22:11.820 --> 00:22:12.820]   Right?
[00:22:12.820 --> 00:22:13.820]   Well, how do you determine that?
[00:22:13.820 --> 00:22:14.820]   Well, look at his stats.
[00:22:14.820 --> 00:22:16.660]   Look at the percentage.
[00:22:16.660 --> 00:22:17.980]   Look at how many rings that they won.
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:19.660]   Look at how many, look at his jump shins.
[00:22:19.660 --> 00:22:20.660]   Look at his free throws.
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.960]   Look at what he's did.
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:26.820]   And so they kept a record so that they can compare and say, "Hey, look at his greatness."
[00:22:26.820 --> 00:22:27.820]   Right?
[00:22:27.820 --> 00:22:32.100]   Now, were they a good basketball player or not a good basketball player because they
[00:22:32.100 --> 00:22:33.780]   kept the record?
[00:22:33.780 --> 00:22:34.980]   No.
[00:22:34.980 --> 00:22:38.740]   Whether they kept the record or not, a good basketball player doesn't change because somebody
[00:22:38.740 --> 00:22:41.180]   kept, started keeping record.
[00:22:41.180 --> 00:22:45.780]   So that's why the scripture says, "The sin came to make sin utterly sinful."
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:49.980]   It wasn't something that wasn't sinful and then made it sinful.
[00:22:49.980 --> 00:22:50.980]   Right?
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:56.700]   It was something that was already sinful and revealed it as sinful to people.
[00:22:56.700 --> 00:22:58.220]   And so they started keeping record.
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:22:59.220]   That's what he means.
[00:22:59.220 --> 00:23:02.580]   That when the law, the sin was there even before the law came.
[00:23:02.580 --> 00:23:08.340]   But when the law came, they start keeping records of sin for what purpose?
[00:23:08.340 --> 00:23:13.220]   So that you can recognize just how utterly sinful we are.
[00:23:13.220 --> 00:23:16.620]   How desperately we are in our sins.
[00:23:16.620 --> 00:23:18.460]   How we are deserving of this wrath.
[00:23:18.460 --> 00:23:25.480]   If one man's sin, one act deserved that wrath, how much more?
[00:23:25.480 --> 00:23:31.380]   And the wrath of God has been stored up from generation to generation.
[00:23:31.380 --> 00:23:33.700]   From one person to the next.
[00:23:33.700 --> 00:23:35.620]   From one group to the other.
[00:23:35.620 --> 00:23:41.340]   See, basically what Paul is saying is, sin is much deeper than you realize.
[00:23:41.340 --> 00:23:44.660]   All the law does is measure what we can see.
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:48.980]   That's why Jesus constantly was telling the Pharisees and he begins to poke at sin that
[00:23:48.980 --> 00:23:50.380]   couldn't be measured by the law.
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:52.380]   He says, "Do not commit adultery."
[00:23:52.380 --> 00:23:53.960]   He said, "I never committed adultery.
[00:23:53.960 --> 00:23:56.900]   But I say to you, if you look at a woman lustfully, you've committed adultery."
[00:23:56.900 --> 00:24:01.720]   See, a lust can't be measured by the law because it's internal.
[00:24:01.720 --> 00:24:03.360]   You have heard it said, "Do not murder."
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:06.620]   But if you hate your brother, you're guilty of murder.
[00:24:06.620 --> 00:24:09.340]   See, hatred can't be measured by the law.
[00:24:09.340 --> 00:24:12.380]   Greed can't be measured by the law.
[00:24:12.380 --> 00:24:15.660]   Bitterness can't be measured by the law.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:20.980]   See, if you measure righteousness simply by the law, you can become righteous and say,
[00:24:20.980 --> 00:24:24.220]   "Hey, I go to church and I do this and I do that."
[00:24:24.220 --> 00:24:27.140]   And not realizing just how deep we are in our sins.
[00:24:27.140 --> 00:24:31.620]   In fact, the people who are sometimes the most dangerous in the presence of God are
[00:24:31.620 --> 00:24:36.540]   people who are surfacely righteous.
[00:24:36.540 --> 00:24:42.300]   But greed, hatred, bitterness, pride is so deeply embedded in them.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:45.260]   But because they keep the law, they feel safe.
[00:24:45.260 --> 00:24:47.740]   And that's exactly what Paul was saying.
[00:24:47.740 --> 00:24:49.900]   He says sin goes much deeper than the law.
[00:24:49.900 --> 00:24:52.420]   It was there even before the law ever came.
[00:24:52.420 --> 00:24:57.660]   We were deep in sin prior to you ever even recognizing it.
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:25:01.740]   Romans 7, 13, "Did that which was good then bring death to me?
[00:25:01.740 --> 00:25:02.740]   By no means.
[00:25:02.740 --> 00:25:06.020]   It was sin producing death in me through what is good.
[00:25:06.020 --> 00:25:09.860]   In order that sin might be shown to be sin, and through commandment might become sinful
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:11.300]   beyond measure."
[00:25:11.300 --> 00:25:17.340]   We've been talking about the height of His love.
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:22.100]   And when we recognize just how deeply desperate we were.
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:28.300]   Even though we've been saved, sometimes we don't realize exactly what it is that we have.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:31.700]   Until we recognize who we were before we met Christ.
[00:25:31.700 --> 00:25:34.540]   And sometimes we forget that.
[00:25:34.540 --> 00:25:36.140]   We forget the anger that we were in.
[00:25:36.140 --> 00:25:37.140]   We forget the bitterness.
[00:25:37.140 --> 00:25:41.100]   We forget how lost we were before we met Christ.
[00:25:41.100 --> 00:25:44.500]   And how that was viewed in God's eyes.
[00:25:44.500 --> 00:25:48.660]   And so therefore grace just becomes grace, but not amazing.
[00:25:48.660 --> 00:25:55.260]   See, as a result of that, as a result of that sin, He says, "Death came into the world,
[00:25:55.260 --> 00:25:56.500]   and death reigned."
[00:25:56.500 --> 00:26:01.100]   It didn't just come into the world, it said death reigned.
[00:26:01.100 --> 00:26:02.720]   What does reigning mean?
[00:26:02.720 --> 00:26:03.720]   To rule.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:06.140]   To have absolute power.
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:09.300]   He doesn't just say that death came in and became part of life.
[00:26:09.300 --> 00:26:12.820]   You know, kind of like we say that every time we go to a funeral or we hear about death,
[00:26:12.820 --> 00:26:14.860]   they say, "Oh, that's just part of life."
[00:26:14.860 --> 00:26:15.980]   Death is part of life.
[00:26:15.980 --> 00:26:18.340]   Is that true?
[00:26:18.340 --> 00:26:24.580]   It is part of our natural experience, our humankind, but is that what God intended?
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:25.580]   Absolutely not.
[00:26:25.580 --> 00:26:26.580]   It is not natural.
[00:26:26.580 --> 00:26:28.180]   It is unnatural.
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:30.740]   Because that's not what God intended.
[00:26:30.740 --> 00:26:35.780]   God's intent in creation of mankind was not for us to be created, become a teenager, and
[00:26:35.780 --> 00:26:37.780]   become an old person, and then die.
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:41.060]   That was not intended in creation.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:43.500]   That happened as a result of the fall.
[00:26:43.500 --> 00:26:50.820]   The diseases that you have, the physical defects, all of these things came in as a result of
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.380]   the fall.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:57.860]   But not only did death come in, it said death absolutely reigned.
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:00.620]   What does that mean, for death to reign?
[00:27:00.620 --> 00:27:03.740]   We typically think of death as something that has happened.
[00:27:03.740 --> 00:27:06.140]   We were sin and separated from God.
[00:27:06.140 --> 00:27:08.500]   We understand salvation in three parts, right?
[00:27:08.500 --> 00:27:09.540]   Past, present, and future.
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:10.760]   We talked about that.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:16.180]   We are justified, we are being sanctified, and one day we will be glorified.
[00:27:16.180 --> 00:27:22.620]   So we are saved, the Bible says we are being saved, and we will be saved.
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:26.640]   But the Bible also describes death in three parts.
[00:27:26.640 --> 00:27:29.460]   That we died when Adam died.
[00:27:29.460 --> 00:27:35.980]   And the Bible also says the gospel is foolishness to those who are perishing, but the power
[00:27:35.980 --> 00:27:38.620]   of God to those who are being saved.
[00:27:38.620 --> 00:27:45.240]   So not only is life described in the present tense, ongoing, so is death.
[00:27:45.240 --> 00:27:48.060]   So death is not something that just happened and then just, "Oh, it just happened in the
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:49.060]   past."
[00:27:49.060 --> 00:27:52.240]   There is a continual decay and reigning of death.
[00:27:52.240 --> 00:27:56.020]   A greater and greater experience of death in mankind.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:28:00.060]   And then ultimately in Revelations it says, "Inasmuch it is appointed for all men to die
[00:28:00.060 --> 00:28:02.220]   once, after that comes judgment."
[00:28:02.220 --> 00:28:06.300]   And the judgment is called second death in the book of Revelation.
[00:28:06.300 --> 00:28:14.100]   So death is described as past, death is described as present, and death is described as future.
[00:28:14.100 --> 00:28:23.040]   So what this means is all mankind is experiencing a growing amount of this death reign.
[00:28:23.040 --> 00:28:25.780]   And that's why, to me, I understand.
[00:28:25.780 --> 00:28:29.260]   You know, when you're younger you see older people, they're so cynical and grizzled, and
[00:28:29.260 --> 00:28:32.100]   you're like, "Get off my lawn!"
[00:28:32.100 --> 00:28:33.100]   You know, like, "Why?"
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:36.340]   But they get older and everybody gets kind of like bitter and angry.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:39.060]   The older I get, I understand them.
[00:28:39.060 --> 00:28:44.060]   I don't want to deal with anybody.
[00:28:44.060 --> 00:28:46.980]   I just want to go up the mountain, get on a boat, just go fishing.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:48.900]   Like, I get it.
[00:28:48.900 --> 00:28:50.060]   Right?
[00:28:50.060 --> 00:28:54.660]   And why, if you go to certain areas of the world where it's just kind of heavy population,
[00:28:54.660 --> 00:28:58.860]   where it's just kind of rubbing shoulders, where you don't see a train full of people
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:00.500]   going to work singing Kumbaya.
[00:29:00.500 --> 00:29:04.380]   You know, it's like, "Oh my gosh, get off of me!"
[00:29:04.380 --> 00:29:05.380]   Right?
[00:29:05.380 --> 00:29:06.380]   "I got caught, oh!"
[00:29:06.380 --> 00:29:07.380]   Everybody's so angry.
[00:29:07.380 --> 00:29:12.100]   You know, I've been to parts of the world where it's just so, I felt so claustrophobic,
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:13.940]   and it was the nastiest group of people.
[00:29:13.940 --> 00:29:14.940]   I'm not going to say where it is.
[00:29:14.940 --> 00:29:15.940]   You know?
[00:29:15.940 --> 00:29:20.580]   You ask them what time it is, and they look at you like you've offended them.
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:21.580]   You know?
[00:29:21.580 --> 00:29:24.700]   Typically speaking, I'm not saying it's like that everywhere, typically speaking, if you
[00:29:24.700 --> 00:29:28.260]   go to places where it's rural, where people don't interact with each other often, they're
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:29.460]   very friendly.
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:31.660]   And you ask them, "Hey, how did you get there?"
[00:29:31.660 --> 00:29:32.660]   It's like, "What?
[00:29:32.660 --> 00:29:33.660]   You're lost!
[00:29:33.660 --> 00:29:35.100]   Come on, have some lemonade."
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   And they take you to it.
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:38.100]   Right?
[00:29:38.100 --> 00:29:39.100]   That's in my mind.
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.060]   I created this world in my mind.
[00:29:41.060 --> 00:29:45.540]   But they tend to be, tend to be in the rural areas a bit more friendly.
[00:29:45.540 --> 00:29:47.620]   This is my theory.
[00:29:47.620 --> 00:29:53.380]   My theory is, if you're, what's corrupted in the world wasn't creation.
[00:29:53.380 --> 00:29:54.860]   People are not angry at trains.
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.220]   People are not angry about cars.
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:30:00.220]   They're angry with the people in the car.
[00:30:00.220 --> 00:30:02.700]   They're angry with the people who are conducting, making decisions.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:06.900]   So their anger and bitterness is toward other people.
[00:30:06.900 --> 00:30:13.300]   So the more you are around other people where death reigns, the more you will experience
[00:30:13.300 --> 00:30:16.500]   this in an increasing manner.
[00:30:16.500 --> 00:30:18.900]   That's why when you have a bunch of young kids, they're happy, and then you have a bunch
[00:30:18.900 --> 00:30:19.900]   of old people.
[00:30:19.900 --> 00:30:20.900]   Right?
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.900]   And I'm not saying it's like that everywhere.
[00:30:23.900 --> 00:30:26.060]   I'm just saying that's how life tends to get.
[00:30:26.060 --> 00:30:28.060]   And I get it.
[00:30:28.060 --> 00:30:32.700]   If you've been backstabbed, and people have hurt you, and you've seen sin over and over,
[00:30:32.700 --> 00:30:33.700]   year after year.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:34.700]   Right?
[00:30:34.700 --> 00:30:36.420]   It's hard not to get like that.
[00:30:36.420 --> 00:30:39.140]   See, that's how the Bible describes death.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:43.220]   Death came into the world, and it absolutely reigned.
[00:30:43.220 --> 00:30:49.020]   See, James chapter 1, verse 15, it says, "But each person is tempted when he is lured and
[00:30:49.020 --> 00:30:51.020]   enticed by his own desire.
[00:30:51.020 --> 00:30:52.980]   Then when it has conceived, gives birth to sin.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:57.980]   And sin, when it is fully grown, brings forth death."
[00:30:57.980 --> 00:30:59.380]   Sin brings death.
[00:30:59.380 --> 00:31:01.820]   The deception of sin.
[00:31:01.820 --> 00:31:07.860]   Typically, the temptation of sin is because we think that at that moment, that sin is
[00:31:07.860 --> 00:31:10.340]   going to bring joy.
[00:31:10.340 --> 00:31:11.340]   We talked about that last week.
[00:31:11.340 --> 00:31:17.300]   When we talked about Jesus came to bring life, life is where you feel the greatest joy.
[00:31:17.300 --> 00:31:21.020]   Whatever it is that you're doing that causes the greatest joy is where you feel the most
[00:31:21.020 --> 00:31:23.140]   alive.
[00:31:23.140 --> 00:31:27.980]   So the opposite of that is when you look at sin, we're pursuing sin.
[00:31:27.980 --> 00:31:30.660]   Nobody pursues sin because it's the right thing to do.
[00:31:30.660 --> 00:31:34.580]   See, sin is not calculated wrong.
[00:31:34.580 --> 00:31:39.620]   Sin is at that moment, you're tempted, and you think that by lying, by cheating, by watching
[00:31:39.620 --> 00:31:44.980]   certain things, by doing certain things, that it's going to make you happy for that moment.
[00:31:44.980 --> 00:31:53.020]   But instead of making you happy, as soon as the act is done, does that bring life?
[00:31:53.020 --> 00:31:55.260]   No.
[00:31:55.260 --> 00:31:59.420]   You see what the scripture says, and it confirms over and over again.
[00:31:59.420 --> 00:32:04.860]   Once sin has conceived, it produces death.
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.180]   It produces death.
[00:32:07.180 --> 00:32:13.420]   That feeling of guilt that comes over, that presses you, that compresses you, the desire
[00:32:13.420 --> 00:32:19.780]   to hide, it ruins fellowship, and it kills the joy in your life.
[00:32:19.780 --> 00:32:24.100]   See, that's an experience of death.
[00:32:24.100 --> 00:32:29.220]   And that's what the scripture says when Adam introduced this, all mankind is under this
[00:32:29.220 --> 00:32:32.260]   umbrella of death.
[00:32:32.260 --> 00:32:36.900]   And the deception of sin is constantly thinking that if you just did this, if you just cut
[00:32:36.900 --> 00:32:39.640]   this corner, if you just do this, that somehow I'm going to be happy.
[00:32:39.640 --> 00:32:42.340]   But at the end of that, you know that that's not there.
[00:32:42.340 --> 00:32:46.060]   It's a death absolutely reigned.
[00:32:46.060 --> 00:32:53.180]   In Genesis chapter 1, 28, God gives the command, creation command, that this is what God desires
[00:32:53.180 --> 00:32:55.660]   from Adam and Eve and all mankind.
[00:32:55.660 --> 00:33:03.580]   He said to them, "Be fruitful and multiply and fill the earth, subdue it and have dominion
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:04.580]   over it."
[00:33:04.580 --> 00:33:09.060]   So there's five commands in the creation account.
[00:33:09.060 --> 00:33:11.260]   Of the five commands, the three are similar.
[00:33:11.260 --> 00:33:15.260]   And the three are, be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth.
[00:33:15.260 --> 00:33:18.540]   Basically saying have a lot of children.
[00:33:18.540 --> 00:33:19.540]   Fill the earth.
[00:33:19.540 --> 00:33:23.620]   Now, after the fall, were they able to do that?
[00:33:23.620 --> 00:33:27.100]   You say, "No."
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.700]   Yes, we're here!
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:33.340]   They were fruitful and they multiplied.
[00:33:33.340 --> 00:33:38.020]   And that's the reason why he created Eve, because Adam can't reproduce by himself.
[00:33:38.020 --> 00:33:39.020]   Right?
[00:33:39.020 --> 00:33:41.020]   So he created Eve to be a suitable helper.
[00:33:41.020 --> 00:33:42.180]   Suitable helper do what?
[00:33:42.180 --> 00:33:44.060]   To carry heavy things?
[00:33:44.060 --> 00:33:45.060]   Right?
[00:33:45.060 --> 00:33:49.780]   No, to be a suitable helper so that you can procreate, to be fruitful, to be multiply
[00:33:49.780 --> 00:33:50.860]   and fill the earth.
[00:33:50.860 --> 00:33:57.380]   But the second part of this command, to subdue and to have dominion, is where the corruption
[00:33:57.380 --> 00:33:58.620]   can be clearly seen.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:06.420]   The word "subdue" in the Hebrew basically means to overcome and to bring under submission.
[00:34:06.420 --> 00:34:11.740]   My professor, Dr. Saucy at Talbot, we're going through this in theology, and he said that
[00:34:11.740 --> 00:34:18.380]   word that is translated for "subdue" in the Hebrew means to conquer.
[00:34:18.380 --> 00:34:19.900]   And I thought, that's a strange word.
[00:34:19.900 --> 00:34:20.900]   Like what would he be conquering?
[00:34:20.900 --> 00:34:22.020]   They're the first human beings.
[00:34:22.020 --> 00:34:23.020]   There's no other nations.
[00:34:23.020 --> 00:34:24.020]   Right?
[00:34:24.020 --> 00:34:25.580]   There's no treaty that they signed.
[00:34:25.580 --> 00:34:26.580]   There's no UN.
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:29.460]   Like, what is he conquering?
[00:34:29.460 --> 00:34:32.260]   But since then, I've been meditating and thinking upon, like, what does he mean?
[00:34:32.260 --> 00:34:39.200]   Why would God use the word, a military term, to describe creation mandate?
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:43.740]   And it makes sense because when we come to Ephesians, Jesus described our walk on this
[00:34:43.740 --> 00:34:45.360]   earth as what?
[00:34:45.360 --> 00:34:47.380]   As a battle.
[00:34:47.380 --> 00:34:51.380]   He described Christian life as a warfare.
[00:34:51.380 --> 00:34:55.300]   And then in 2 Corinthians 4, 4, it says the god of this age is who?
[00:34:55.300 --> 00:34:57.660]   Satan.
[00:34:57.660 --> 00:34:58.900]   So when did this happen?
[00:34:58.900 --> 00:35:01.700]   When did Satan become the god of this age?
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:06.620]   When did his kingdom get established that we needed to be delivered from to bring into
[00:35:06.620 --> 00:35:08.060]   the kingdom of Jesus?
[00:35:08.060 --> 00:35:09.060]   When did this happen?
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.980]   I'm not going to answer for you.
[00:35:10.980 --> 00:35:12.340]   I'm just going to leave it out there.
[00:35:12.340 --> 00:35:13.340]   Okay?
[00:35:13.340 --> 00:35:14.740]   So during lunch, you can ask yourself.
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:16.700]   Just don't say heretical things.
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:18.520]   Alright?
[00:35:18.520 --> 00:35:24.160]   So the idea of it is that God created creation, and he wanted them to multiply and fill the
[00:35:24.160 --> 00:35:30.620]   earth and somehow capture, or somehow subdue, at least that's the language that is used,
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.340]   and then to have dominion.
[00:35:32.340 --> 00:35:35.180]   The word dominion is to have rule over.
[00:35:35.180 --> 00:35:36.500]   Right?
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:42.340]   But instead, what God created Adam and Eve to do, what does it say?
[00:35:42.340 --> 00:35:47.100]   Adam commits a sin, and because of sin, death comes in, and death what?
[00:35:47.100 --> 00:35:48.740]   Has dominion.
[00:35:48.740 --> 00:35:51.060]   Death is the one that rules.
[00:35:51.060 --> 00:35:55.940]   What God intended Adam and Eve and mankind to do, now death took over.
[00:35:55.940 --> 00:36:02.140]   And who has the, who has the, who is the accuser, right?
[00:36:02.140 --> 00:36:03.940]   That accuses, that causes death?
[00:36:03.940 --> 00:36:04.940]   It's Satan.
[00:36:04.940 --> 00:36:10.380]   It's in Hebrews chapter 2, 14 and 16, it says, "Since therefore the children share in flesh
[00:36:10.380 --> 00:36:15.460]   and blood, he himself likewise partook of the same thing, that through death he might
[00:36:15.460 --> 00:36:20.140]   destroy the one who has power of death, that is the devil."
[00:36:20.140 --> 00:36:22.100]   Power of death is the devil.
[00:36:22.100 --> 00:36:24.540]   So when it says that death reigned, what does it mean?
[00:36:24.540 --> 00:36:25.540]   Satan reigns.
[00:36:25.540 --> 00:36:31.620]   By holding death over the heads of all mankind, and deliver all those who through fear of
[00:36:31.620 --> 00:36:35.060]   death were subject to lifelong slavery.
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:38.620]   I know probably a lot of you guys have probably read that text before and said, well fear
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:41.380]   of death and to slavery, it's like oh that's what the Bible says.
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:43.540]   But is that true?
[00:36:43.540 --> 00:36:47.460]   Before you became a Christian, were you living in fear of death?
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:48.940]   And which caused you to be enslaved?
[00:36:48.940 --> 00:36:53.500]   I mean that's what it says, but was that your experience?
[00:36:53.500 --> 00:36:57.660]   Are the non-Christians that you know, are they living every day like in fear of death?
[00:36:57.660 --> 00:37:01.580]   You know, at least from what I'm observing, there's a lot of people who jump off of buildings
[00:37:01.580 --> 00:37:08.180]   with a little cloth, you know, saying, "I'm going to live it, if I die, I die, whatever."
[00:37:08.180 --> 00:37:09.180]   Crazy people, right?
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:14.620]   Tight rope, and bungee jumping, and rock climbing, and they do all of this stuff, it's like,
[00:37:14.620 --> 00:37:16.900]   hey, if I die, I die.
[00:37:16.900 --> 00:37:19.660]   I know there are some people who are living in fear of death, but for the most part, it
[00:37:19.660 --> 00:37:23.460]   seems like we just kind of marginalize it, we just don't think about it.
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:29.140]   We need to understand what the author means here in the context, right?
[00:37:29.140 --> 00:37:32.620]   What is the greatest, last rule of interpretation?
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:41.580]   Again, I already said it, it starts with a C, not commentary, but context.
[00:37:41.580 --> 00:37:43.900]   So what is the context of this passage?
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:45.020]   Who is he referring to?
[00:37:45.020 --> 00:37:49.820]   So who is the book of Hebrews written to?
[00:37:49.820 --> 00:37:53.580]   It's a trick question.
[00:37:53.580 --> 00:37:56.260]   It's not a trick.
[00:37:56.260 --> 00:37:58.260]   To Hebrews, right?
[00:37:58.260 --> 00:38:03.740]   In case you didn't know, I was called Hebrews.
[00:38:03.740 --> 00:38:06.700]   It's written to Hebrews, meaning Jewish people.
[00:38:06.700 --> 00:38:11.280]   And the problem with the Jewish people, the second, third generation Jewish Christians,
[00:38:11.280 --> 00:38:15.940]   is that they were reverting back to the old system of law.
[00:38:15.940 --> 00:38:20.780]   And so what the author is saying is, they are saying that the power of death has enslaved
[00:38:20.780 --> 00:38:21.780]   them.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:25.280]   Death to them meant judgment.
[00:38:25.280 --> 00:38:28.080]   That they were going back to the Old Testament law, thinking that if they kept the rules
[00:38:28.080 --> 00:38:33.100]   and the laws, and went back to their old system, that somehow they will be delivered from the
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:35.600]   power of death.
[00:38:35.600 --> 00:38:40.300]   But instead, he says, if you go back to that system, all you're going to see is greater
[00:38:40.300 --> 00:38:42.320]   death, a second death.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.420]   And true life is found in Christ, and Christ alone.
[00:38:44.420 --> 00:38:49.660]   So what he's referring to in Hebrews chapter 2, 14, are people who are constantly living
[00:38:49.660 --> 00:38:55.180]   under the fear that you haven't done enough.
[00:38:55.180 --> 00:38:59.460]   That your safety is not in Christ.
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.820]   That your joy in life isn't in Christ.
[00:39:02.820 --> 00:39:06.380]   It's about being better than other people.
[00:39:06.380 --> 00:39:10.260]   It's about giving enough, and doing enough.
[00:39:10.260 --> 00:39:12.060]   And being disciplined enough.
[00:39:12.060 --> 00:39:15.020]   Now all of these things are mandated in scripture.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:19.620]   Now when we get to Romans chapter 12, I mean, he's going to lay that on thick.
[00:39:19.620 --> 00:39:24.660]   But he's talking to a group of people who the power of judgment has so gripped them,
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:28.060]   that it affects everything that they do.
[00:39:28.060 --> 00:39:29.060]   They're literally under slavery.
[00:39:29.060 --> 00:39:33.340]   And that's what it says in John chapter 8, because these Jews were coming, who were so
[00:39:33.340 --> 00:39:34.860]   concerned about keeping the law.
[00:39:34.860 --> 00:39:41.020]   And Jesus says, "If the Son sets you free, you will be free indeed."
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:45.500]   There is no freedom with what you're doing.
[00:39:45.500 --> 00:39:53.340]   Until you are absolutely gripped by the grace of Jesus Christ, you'll be enslaved for the
[00:39:53.340 --> 00:39:55.700]   rest of your life.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:58.620]   You'll be enslaved, without even knowing it.
[00:39:58.620 --> 00:40:01.580]   Thinking you're being righteous, but enslaved.
[00:40:01.580 --> 00:40:06.220]   Thinking you're worshipping God, but absolutely enslaved.
[00:40:06.220 --> 00:40:12.500]   Thinking that you have assurance, but deep, deeply inside, constantly living in fear,
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:15.220]   have I done enough?
[00:40:15.220 --> 00:40:18.880]   That's why he says, "While we were yet sinners, while we were still weak, while we were enemies
[00:40:18.880 --> 00:40:19.880]   of God."
[00:40:19.880 --> 00:40:21.760]   That's how much He loved us.
[00:40:21.760 --> 00:40:25.260]   And this sin goes deep, way back into Adam.
[00:40:25.260 --> 00:40:28.340]   And yet, despite all of that, because we were weak, because we were sinners, because we
[00:40:28.340 --> 00:40:35.060]   were enemies, He came and He loved us.
[00:40:35.060 --> 00:40:39.820]   We talk about all these details of original sin, and predestination, and justification,
[00:40:39.820 --> 00:40:40.820]   and all of that.
[00:40:40.820 --> 00:40:45.700]   And sometimes we get so caught up in that, and we forget the big picture.
[00:40:45.700 --> 00:40:46.700]   What's the point?
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.460]   What's the point?
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:52.820]   Why is He saying all this, and why are we spending all this time in the morning, like
[00:40:52.820 --> 00:40:57.300]   in a lecture hall, dissecting words and context?
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:59.940]   And I know, you know, I hear it all the time.
[00:40:59.940 --> 00:41:02.060]   You know, it's like, people don't want to hear it.
[00:41:02.060 --> 00:41:04.060]   Just give me the plain point.
[00:41:04.060 --> 00:41:10.780]   The point of all of this is to say the same thing that He's been saying all along.
[00:41:10.780 --> 00:41:17.500]   That if you believe that Jesus Christ died for you, if you really believe that, not just
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:25.620]   superficially, not just superstitiously, but if you really believe that, you're free.
[00:41:25.620 --> 00:41:28.300]   You're free.
[00:41:28.300 --> 00:41:34.260]   There is therefore now no condemnation for those who are in Christ Jesus.
[00:41:34.260 --> 00:41:40.820]   Just as sin came into the world through one man, and brought death, and death reigned.
[00:41:40.820 --> 00:41:44.140]   To the conclusion of this is not these four verses.
[00:41:44.140 --> 00:41:47.380]   The conclusion of it, it starts in verse 15.
[00:41:47.380 --> 00:41:52.700]   "But, but, but the free gift is not like the trespass.
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:57.820]   For if many die through one man's trespasses, much more have the grace of God and the free
[00:41:57.820 --> 00:42:03.460]   gift by the grace of that one man, Jesus Christ, abounded for many."
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:07.100]   We'll get to that when we talk about it next time, but let me conclude with the final pass
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:10.460]   in 1 Corinthians 15, 52 to 58.
[00:42:10.460 --> 00:42:16.500]   "In a moment, in the twinkling of an eye, at the last trumpet, for the trumpet will
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:22.580]   sound and the dead will be raised imperishable, and we shall be changed.
[00:42:22.580 --> 00:42:30.500]   For this perishable body must put on the imperishable, and this mortal body must put on immortality.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:34.900]   When the perishable puts on the imperishable, and the mortal puts on immortality, then shall
[00:42:34.900 --> 00:42:39.660]   come to pass the saying that is written, 'Death is swallowed up in victory.'
[00:42:39.660 --> 00:42:41.700]   O death, where is your victory?
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:42.740]   Where is your sting?
[00:42:42.740 --> 00:42:47.460]   The sting of death is sin, and the power of sin is the law, but thanks be to God who gives
[00:42:47.460 --> 00:42:50.340]   us the victory through our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:42:50.340 --> 00:42:51.740]   Amen?
[00:42:51.740 --> 00:42:57.100]   Let's meditate on this this week, you know, as we think upon the depth of His love, the
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.780]   height of His love, the length and width of His love, that we may experience the fullness
[00:43:01.780 --> 00:43:03.340]   that God desires for us.
[00:43:03.340 --> 00:43:07.860]   Let's take a few minutes to pray as we invite the praise team to come up.
[00:43:07.860 --> 00:43:12.340]   Again, it's important for us to wrestle with the small things because these small things
[00:43:12.340 --> 00:43:16.980]   add up to the big picture, and the big picture is always Christ crucified.
[00:43:16.980 --> 00:43:21.420]   It is foolishness to those who are perishing, but it is the power of God for those who are
[00:43:21.420 --> 00:43:23.140]   being saved.
[00:43:23.140 --> 00:43:25.980]   So let's fix our eyes upon Christ, author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:43:25.980 --> 00:43:33.820]   So as we take some time to pray, to reflect on that, how deeply have we been affected
[00:43:33.820 --> 00:43:36.020]   by what it is that we are learning in the Book of Romans?
[00:43:36.020 --> 00:43:40.700]   So let's take some time to pray and come before the Lord and ask the Lord to strengthen us
[00:43:40.700 --> 00:43:41.700]   in this thing.
[00:43:41.700 --> 00:43:42.260]   Okay, let's take some time to pray.
[00:43:42.260 --> 00:43:52.260]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
