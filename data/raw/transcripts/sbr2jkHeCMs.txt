[00:05:50.580 --> 00:05:51.820]   as you're ushering in the new year.
[00:05:51.820 --> 00:05:54.420]   So let's take a moment to bow and a word of prayer
[00:05:54.420 --> 00:05:56.280]   as we begin our service, let's pray.
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:02.700]   Heavenly Father, we take this time to thank you, God.
[00:06:02.700 --> 00:06:06.320]   So much has happened, not only just simply in this past year
[00:06:06.320 --> 00:06:09.900]   but, God, throughout time, you have been proven faithful
[00:06:09.900 --> 00:06:12.300]   and so powerful in our lives.
[00:06:12.300 --> 00:06:14.780]   So God, we give thanks to you and praise to you,
[00:06:14.780 --> 00:06:17.520]   and we really hope that, God, moments like this
[00:06:17.520 --> 00:06:20.860]   will gather our hearts to be mindful,
[00:06:20.860 --> 00:06:23.980]   to truly remember just how good you have been.
[00:06:23.980 --> 00:06:26.580]   And we also pray, God, that as we take moments like this
[00:06:26.580 --> 00:06:29.980]   to consider and think about how we can continue
[00:06:29.980 --> 00:06:33.580]   to live intentionally under your mighty hand,
[00:06:33.580 --> 00:06:36.180]   how we can dedicate more and more of ourselves
[00:06:36.180 --> 00:06:37.900]   and our time unto you.
[00:06:37.900 --> 00:06:41.300]   We ask, God, that you would continue to lead and provide.
[00:06:41.300 --> 00:06:43.580]   We thank you for this time that we have to worship you.
[00:06:43.580 --> 00:06:45.380]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.

[00:25:08.980 --> 00:25:33.660]   - Well, thank you to all the media team members
[00:25:33.660 --> 00:25:36.440]   and all of the, we're so grateful
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:39.520]   for the many events that happened this year,
[00:25:39.520 --> 00:25:40.640]   just looking at the video.
[00:25:40.640 --> 00:25:43.440]   Some of that seems like years ago,
[00:25:43.440 --> 00:25:46.440]   but, and some of the pictures are so cute,
[00:25:46.440 --> 00:25:48.160]   especially the Father's Day one.
[00:25:48.160 --> 00:25:49.820]   Let's make sure to run that back.
[00:25:49.820 --> 00:25:53.640]   I wanted to encourage you guys
[00:25:53.640 --> 00:25:57.040]   with a specific meditation and thought,
[00:25:57.040 --> 00:26:02.040]   and I'll read a simple verse that you know well and pray.
[00:26:02.080 --> 00:26:06.040]   It comes from Matthew chapter six, verse 33,
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.920]   and it says, "But seek first his kingdom
[00:26:07.920 --> 00:26:09.440]   "and his righteousness,
[00:26:09.440 --> 00:26:11.800]   "and all these things will be added to you."
[00:26:11.800 --> 00:26:13.820]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:26:13.820 --> 00:26:17.920]   Father God, as we together saw all those photos
[00:26:17.920 --> 00:26:20.580]   of our church community, our spiritual family,
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.200]   we feel so blessed that because of what you've provided,
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.440]   the church is not just simply something
[00:26:27.440 --> 00:26:29.020]   that we established together.
[00:26:29.020 --> 00:26:31.100]   We know, God, you're building it,
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:32.960]   and therefore we get to enjoy being a part
[00:26:32.960 --> 00:26:35.980]   of the fellowship growing together in your name.
[00:26:35.980 --> 00:26:37.540]   And so for every blessing we have here,
[00:26:37.540 --> 00:26:38.900]   we thank you so much.
[00:26:38.900 --> 00:26:43.920]   And we also pray, God, that more and more intentionally,
[00:26:43.920 --> 00:26:47.260]   every single one of us would continue to live our day
[00:26:47.260 --> 00:26:51.440]   with a great purposefulness and a heart's intent
[00:26:51.440 --> 00:26:54.240]   to continue to build your church,
[00:26:54.240 --> 00:26:56.580]   to continue to establish your will,
[00:26:56.580 --> 00:26:59.940]   and to follow after all of your instructions for our lives.
[00:26:59.940 --> 00:27:03.000]   We thank you, God, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:08.000]   Now, with that, there were so many different activities
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:11.580]   at church, and I think one of the blessings
[00:27:11.580 --> 00:27:15.400]   that we have is we have then, as the church grows,
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:19.520]   many opportunities to engage.
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:23.400]   A lot of different avenues for us to connect
[00:27:23.400 --> 00:27:26.220]   and then keep ourselves very busy, which is great,
[00:27:26.220 --> 00:27:30.040]   but it presents, in of itself, a new challenge.
[00:27:30.040 --> 00:27:32.400]   And as you'd expect, the new challenge is,
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:34.680]   which ones do I choose?
[00:27:34.680 --> 00:27:36.400]   And what I want you guys to think about
[00:27:36.400 --> 00:27:38.880]   is the topic of priorities.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:43.200]   That famous passage that we just read in Matthew 6,
[00:27:43.200 --> 00:27:45.840]   it gives us this priority that we must seek
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.440]   the kingdom of God first.
[00:27:48.440 --> 00:27:51.200]   To help us think about this, I wanna say
[00:27:51.200 --> 00:27:54.960]   that sometimes it is very, very difficult for us
[00:27:54.960 --> 00:27:57.720]   to keep some of our priorities straight and in order.
[00:27:57.720 --> 00:28:00.420]   We're very grateful for a lot of the blessings
[00:28:00.420 --> 00:28:03.480]   and opportunities we have, but staying focused
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:07.320]   is actually a massive challenge in our lives.
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:09.880]   And, per example, I know there are a lot
[00:28:09.880 --> 00:28:11.800]   of college students with us.
[00:28:11.800 --> 00:28:14.400]   In college, every time the end of the year rolls around,
[00:28:14.400 --> 00:28:15.680]   the schedule gets so busy.
[00:28:15.680 --> 00:28:18.080]   You're cramming for tests, you're putting together,
[00:28:18.080 --> 00:28:20.400]   you know, how are you gonna get your assignments done?
[00:28:20.400 --> 00:28:22.800]   You still have plans to make for, you know,
[00:28:22.800 --> 00:28:24.780]   once the semester is done, et cetera,
[00:28:24.780 --> 00:28:26.920]   and you may show up to a study hall,
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:30.920]   and once you arrive, distractions all around you.
[00:28:30.920 --> 00:28:33.220]   On your left, there's a bunch of people playing ping pong,
[00:28:33.220 --> 00:28:36.720]   and you say to yourself, I do need to get my blood flowing,
[00:28:36.720 --> 00:28:38.760]   so you go and play a little couple of ping pong.
[00:28:38.760 --> 00:28:40.200]   And then after you play ping pong,
[00:28:40.200 --> 00:28:42.320]   you're like, oh, I did kind of work up an appetite,
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.240]   so over there on your right, there's like a buffet.
[00:28:45.240 --> 00:28:47.400]   And then so you walk over there and you grab snacks,
[00:28:47.400 --> 00:28:50.340]   and have you met those people who grab the snacks
[00:28:50.340 --> 00:28:52.800]   and take it with them to their study table?
[00:28:52.800 --> 00:28:54.080]   That was me.
[00:28:54.080 --> 00:28:55.760]   And so what ends up happening is you're studying,
[00:28:55.760 --> 00:28:57.760]   but actually, you're just having mealtime.
[00:28:57.760 --> 00:29:00.080]   You finish the whole bag of snacks,
[00:29:00.080 --> 00:29:01.280]   and then you feel kind of nasty,
[00:29:01.280 --> 00:29:04.040]   so you're like, oh, I need a break from my eating.
[00:29:04.040 --> 00:29:05.680]   And then so you go over to take a break,
[00:29:05.680 --> 00:29:07.400]   and you see an old friend,
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:09.360]   and then after seeing your old friend,
[00:29:09.360 --> 00:29:10.880]   you realize, oh my goodness,
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:13.840]   me and my friend had this burning question for Pastor Nate.
[00:29:13.840 --> 00:29:14.680]   Where is he?
[00:29:14.680 --> 00:29:16.560]   You go find him in his office.
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:18.160]   You bother him for a little while,
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:20.000]   and then you realize it's two in the morning,
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.880]   and you're like, oh my goodness,
[00:29:20.880 --> 00:29:22.160]   I need to go home and study.
[00:29:22.160 --> 00:29:24.160]   So you go home and study, but then et cetera, et cetera,
[00:29:24.160 --> 00:29:25.000]   and the story goes on.
[00:29:25.000 --> 00:29:26.080]   You know this, yes?
[00:29:26.080 --> 00:29:27.320]   I'm not saying it's all of you.
[00:29:27.320 --> 00:29:29.640]   It was more so me, okay?
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:32.040]   And what you realize at the end of that
[00:29:32.040 --> 00:29:33.920]   is I came to do one thing,
[00:29:33.920 --> 00:29:37.040]   but I ended up doing six, right?
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:41.320]   And I know I am in some sense poking fun at the collegians,
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:43.960]   but as a matter of fact,
[00:29:43.960 --> 00:29:47.200]   you know well, as you observe mankind,
[00:29:47.200 --> 00:29:48.920]   that every single one of us,
[00:29:48.920 --> 00:29:50.640]   we come to do one thing,
[00:29:50.640 --> 00:29:52.800]   and then we end up doing seven.
[00:29:52.800 --> 00:29:56.760]   What's more, it's not so far from the college life
[00:29:56.760 --> 00:30:00.000]   where just the simple necessities of food,
[00:30:00.000 --> 00:30:01.560]   what do I want to eat?
[00:30:01.560 --> 00:30:05.680]   Just the simple necessities of break, leisure,
[00:30:05.680 --> 00:30:07.680]   needing a break from my work,
[00:30:07.680 --> 00:30:08.560]   these are some of the things
[00:30:08.560 --> 00:30:10.400]   that distract us through our lives.
[00:30:10.400 --> 00:30:12.100]   It's not just your college career.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:17.960]   So I think that for all of us,
[00:30:17.960 --> 00:30:20.000]   the difficulty and problem is not
[00:30:20.000 --> 00:30:21.680]   that you don't know what your priority is.
[00:30:21.680 --> 00:30:24.200]   You know you should be working,
[00:30:24.200 --> 00:30:26.560]   laboring for the glory of God.
[00:30:26.560 --> 00:30:29.360]   You should be praying and prioritizing knowing the Lord
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:31.800]   and making him known through evangelism, amen?
[00:30:31.800 --> 00:30:34.720]   You want to be faithful in your home,
[00:30:34.720 --> 00:30:37.440]   you want to be faithful in your church, amen?
[00:30:37.440 --> 00:30:39.280]   Those are things you've heard many, many times.
[00:30:39.280 --> 00:30:43.740]   The difficulty is keeping those priorities straight.
[00:30:43.740 --> 00:30:47.520]   And why is it so hard?
[00:30:47.520 --> 00:30:50.640]   And it may be because there are so many different
[00:30:50.640 --> 00:30:53.640]   good, fun activities all around us
[00:30:53.640 --> 00:30:55.760]   and we're just trying to squeeze in seven.
[00:30:55.760 --> 00:31:01.440]   Now, the scriptures gives us another possible reason
[00:31:01.440 --> 00:31:02.720]   and it's very, very convicting
[00:31:02.720 --> 00:31:04.920]   and I just wanted to make sure to share that with you
[00:31:04.920 --> 00:31:06.580]   and have us think about it.
[00:31:06.580 --> 00:31:09.560]   Why is it so difficult for us to keep focused
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.360]   and our priorities in line?
[00:31:11.360 --> 00:31:14.360]   We'll turn again to your Bible.
[00:31:14.360 --> 00:31:16.320]   Turn to Matthew chapter six.
[00:31:16.320 --> 00:31:20.840]   I'm gonna be reading from verse 25 down to verse 34.
[00:31:20.840 --> 00:31:24.760]   And it says, "For this reason I say to you,
[00:31:24.760 --> 00:31:27.800]   "do not be worried about your life,
[00:31:27.800 --> 00:31:30.100]   "as to what you will eat or what you will drink,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:33.500]   "nor for your body as to what you will put on it.
[00:31:33.500 --> 00:31:34.900]   "Is not life more than food
[00:31:34.900 --> 00:31:36.820]   "and the body more than clothing?
[00:31:36.820 --> 00:31:38.680]   "Look at the birds of the air,
[00:31:38.680 --> 00:31:42.240]   "that they do not sow nor reap nor gather into barns,
[00:31:42.240 --> 00:31:44.360]   "and yet your heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:47.040]   "Are you not worth much more than they?
[00:31:47.040 --> 00:31:48.680]   "And who of you, by being worried,
[00:31:48.680 --> 00:31:51.500]   "can add a single hour to his life?
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.440]   "And why are you worried about clothing?
[00:31:53.440 --> 00:31:55.540]   "Observe how the lilies of the field grow.
[00:31:55.540 --> 00:31:57.780]   "They do not toil nor do they spin.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.860]   "Yet I say to you that not even Solomon,
[00:31:59.860 --> 00:32:02.900]   "in all his glory, clothed himself like one of these.
[00:32:02.900 --> 00:32:05.380]   "But if God so clothes the grass of the field,
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:06.820]   "which is alive today and tomorrow
[00:32:06.820 --> 00:32:08.560]   "is thrown into the furnace,
[00:32:08.560 --> 00:32:11.060]   "will he not much more clothe you?
[00:32:11.060 --> 00:32:12.940]   "You of little faith.
[00:32:12.940 --> 00:32:15.420]   "Do not worry then, saying, what will we eat?
[00:32:15.420 --> 00:32:17.020]   "And what will we drink?
[00:32:17.020 --> 00:32:18.940]   "Or what will we wear for clothing?
[00:32:18.940 --> 00:32:21.820]   "For the Gentiles eagerly seek all these things.
[00:32:21.820 --> 00:32:23.700]   "For your heavenly Father knows
[00:32:23.700 --> 00:32:25.380]   "that you need all these things.
[00:32:25.380 --> 00:32:29.420]   "But seek first his kingdom and his righteousness,
[00:32:29.420 --> 00:32:32.020]   "and all these things will be added to you.
[00:32:32.020 --> 00:32:33.400]   "So do not worry about tomorrow,
[00:32:33.400 --> 00:32:36.000]   "for tomorrow will care for itself,
[00:32:36.000 --> 00:32:41.000]   "each day as enough trouble has enough trouble of its own."
[00:32:41.280 --> 00:32:42.960]   So when we take a look at this passage,
[00:32:42.960 --> 00:32:46.920]   it gives to us this explanation, which is my point one,
[00:32:46.920 --> 00:32:49.120]   that we have a difficult time keeping our priorities
[00:32:49.120 --> 00:32:54.000]   because we worry way too much to stay focused.
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:55.480]   This passage, which is interesting,
[00:32:55.480 --> 00:32:58.920]   again, my guess is you've heard this commandment
[00:32:58.920 --> 00:33:03.280]   so many times, to seek first the kingdom of God.
[00:33:03.280 --> 00:33:05.000]   But did you know that in context,
[00:33:05.000 --> 00:33:08.320]   he is saying this as a solution to the problem,
[00:33:08.320 --> 00:33:11.560]   and the problem is that we are beset with anxiety
[00:33:11.560 --> 00:33:14.320]   and worry constantly, even especially
[00:33:14.320 --> 00:33:16.380]   for the stuff of our daily necessities.
[00:33:16.380 --> 00:33:19.320]   So what's really interesting is this text tells us
[00:33:19.320 --> 00:33:23.200]   the reason why we are losing track
[00:33:23.200 --> 00:33:27.720]   of the things we ought to be doing is because you worry.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:30.360]   And what's really interesting, that the highlight
[00:33:30.360 --> 00:33:33.680]   and the prime examples that Jesus gives
[00:33:33.680 --> 00:33:36.280]   are such basic things.
[00:33:36.280 --> 00:33:39.240]   Again, earlier, I wasn't necessarily taking a shot
[00:33:39.240 --> 00:33:41.800]   at the Collegians, but I mentioned about food
[00:33:41.800 --> 00:33:45.920]   because he uses that as a primary example
[00:33:45.920 --> 00:33:49.920]   as to what we're constantly worried for, right?
[00:33:49.920 --> 00:33:53.640]   That our basic necessity is this.
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:55.600]   It says, "Do not be worried about your life,
[00:33:55.600 --> 00:33:58.160]   "what you will eat or what you will drink."
[00:33:58.160 --> 00:34:03.160]   And then secondly, the second example is still more,
[00:34:03.980 --> 00:34:07.640]   it says, "Your body, what you will put on it,
[00:34:07.640 --> 00:34:11.700]   "what you will wear, and basically how your body will look."
[00:34:11.700 --> 00:34:15.380]   So as you think about this, and I was meditating,
[00:34:15.380 --> 00:34:19.500]   I was very humbled by this text, right?
[00:34:19.500 --> 00:34:23.500]   That just simply the care for how I look and how I appear
[00:34:23.500 --> 00:34:26.900]   can get me so distracted from my priorities?
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:27.980]   Absolutely.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.020]   Now, I could maybe rationalize and say
[00:34:34.020 --> 00:34:38.220]   that I don't really care about how I look anymore.
[00:34:38.220 --> 00:34:42.940]   I've 100% accepted the fact that I'm not much to look at,
[00:34:42.940 --> 00:34:45.780]   so I don't care about what I wear.
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:48.500]   I 100% buy my clothes at Costco.
[00:34:48.500 --> 00:34:51.180]   And all of you guys who wear Puma socks
[00:34:51.180 --> 00:34:55.020]   on the discount bundle, you're godly, okay?
[00:34:55.020 --> 00:34:56.180]   I'm just kidding, okay?
[00:34:57.180 --> 00:35:00.900]   I mean, we would think that we would be so mature
[00:35:00.900 --> 00:35:04.280]   as to move past what we struggled with when we were teens,
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:07.740]   caring so much about brand names and how we look.
[00:35:07.740 --> 00:35:09.180]   But as a matter of fact,
[00:35:09.180 --> 00:35:11.380]   if you look at the industry statistics
[00:35:11.380 --> 00:35:13.540]   of how much money is being spent in America
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:16.380]   on cosmetics and appearance, it's wild.
[00:35:16.380 --> 00:35:20.300]   That annually, something like $35 billion
[00:35:20.300 --> 00:35:23.360]   is used on cosmetics.
[00:35:24.720 --> 00:35:27.960]   So many different types of products are out there.
[00:35:27.960 --> 00:35:30.620]   I mean, I could tell you, yes, I kind of don't care,
[00:35:30.620 --> 00:35:32.400]   but on the flip side, I do.
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.400]   All of a sudden, I find myself spending money on,
[00:35:34.400 --> 00:35:37.760]   this is kind of a strange open confession,
[00:35:37.760 --> 00:35:41.880]   like $25 for a bottle of hair growth shampoo.
[00:35:41.880 --> 00:35:42.720]   It's crazy.
[00:35:42.720 --> 00:35:47.220]   Another $25 for a little bottle of digestive enzymes.
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:48.060]   It's wild.
[00:35:48.060 --> 00:35:50.560]   Why am I saying this?
[00:35:50.560 --> 00:35:53.420]   It's because the passage is humbling.
[00:35:54.680 --> 00:35:56.960]   And to take it even further,
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:35:58.880]   if you noticed, in the passage,
[00:35:58.880 --> 00:36:02.760]   he talks about how for this reason, do not worry.
[00:36:02.760 --> 00:36:05.200]   And the reason was you cannot serve two masters
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:06.920]   was the verse right before this.
[00:36:06.920 --> 00:36:11.760]   It is to our deception to think that Satan
[00:36:11.760 --> 00:36:15.280]   has to go super far and he has to devise
[00:36:15.280 --> 00:36:17.920]   the greatest scheme to knock you off your horse.
[00:36:17.920 --> 00:36:21.040]   No, he could just make you worry
[00:36:21.040 --> 00:36:22.760]   about what you're going to eat.
[00:36:22.760 --> 00:36:25.520]   Remember, at this time, the vast majority of people
[00:36:25.520 --> 00:36:29.320]   did have a difficult time making ends meet.
[00:36:29.320 --> 00:36:31.160]   And they live day to day.
[00:36:31.160 --> 00:36:34.240]   They live paycheck to paycheck, so to speak, yes?
[00:36:34.240 --> 00:36:37.120]   And in that kind of situation, worry, anxiety,
[00:36:37.120 --> 00:36:39.520]   how am I going to make sure I take care of everybody,
[00:36:39.520 --> 00:36:41.480]   myself, my family, et cetera?
[00:36:41.480 --> 00:36:45.760]   And the struggle to do what we think everybody else
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:49.860]   is doing and how we look as compared to everybody else.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.820]   That alone can make our priorities so skewed and muddy.
[00:36:54.820 --> 00:36:57.200]   And that's why the scriptures are chock full
[00:36:57.200 --> 00:36:59.840]   of commandments for us, for you and me.
[00:36:59.840 --> 00:37:01.260]   Do not worry.
[00:37:01.260 --> 00:37:03.560]   Cast your anxieties on Christ.
[00:37:03.560 --> 00:37:06.440]   Be on the alert, be sober.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:08.040]   And there's so many scriptures that tell you
[00:37:08.040 --> 00:37:10.960]   stop being afraid, but rather be strong,
[00:37:10.960 --> 00:37:12.780]   be courageous, amen?
[00:37:12.780 --> 00:37:14.140]   Why?
[00:37:14.140 --> 00:37:16.420]   Because that alone could cause us
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.960]   to be derailed from our purpose.
[00:37:19.960 --> 00:37:22.000]   So I took a moment to think about this,
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:25.280]   and I want to ask you this question.
[00:37:25.280 --> 00:37:28.360]   For you tonight, as you think about this year,
[00:37:28.360 --> 00:37:30.960]   and then looking into the next year,
[00:37:30.960 --> 00:37:32.440]   what are the biggest worries that
[00:37:32.440 --> 00:37:36.340]   have been determining your decisions?
[00:37:36.340 --> 00:37:37.680]   What are some of the biggest worry
[00:37:37.680 --> 00:37:40.480]   that have been taking the biggest places in terms
[00:37:40.480 --> 00:37:44.000]   of the real estate of your mind and your heart?
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.460]   What are some of the things that are causing you
[00:37:46.460 --> 00:37:51.220]   to think so much about whether it's your job, right?
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.180]   Yes, you will have to work incredibly hard in your life
[00:37:54.180 --> 00:37:55.700]   like you're serving the Lord himself,
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:59.340]   but we should not worry, amen?
[00:37:59.340 --> 00:38:01.180]   Are you super worried about your children?
[00:38:01.180 --> 00:38:04.300]   Yes, you and I are called to be faithful parents,
[00:38:04.300 --> 00:38:08.140]   exemplifying the parenthood of our Lord.
[00:38:08.140 --> 00:38:11.660]   But do not worry, even about the kids.
[00:38:11.660 --> 00:38:13.040]   Are you worried about the future?
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:15.580]   Yes, you're supposed to prepare, and be wise, and be
[00:38:15.580 --> 00:38:18.260]   even wiser than the ants.
[00:38:18.260 --> 00:38:20.180]   But do not worry.
[00:38:20.180 --> 00:38:21.740]   Why?
[00:38:21.740 --> 00:38:26.820]   Because that worry is going to cause us to be led astray.
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:31.340]   And I thought about what is it that I worry about.
[00:38:31.340 --> 00:38:33.940]   And I did come to my own conclusion
[00:38:33.940 --> 00:38:37.460]   that it is this worry I don't have time to get
[00:38:37.460 --> 00:38:40.180]   to all the important things.
[00:38:40.180 --> 00:38:42.700]   I know I want to pray, I know I want to evangelize,
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:44.440]   I want to take care of the flock of the church,
[00:38:44.440 --> 00:38:47.000]   I want to take care of my wife, I want to take care of my kids,
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:48.280]   I want to meet the people who are sick,
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:50.120]   and I want to meet the people who are da-da.
[00:38:50.120 --> 00:38:51.280]   And the list goes on.
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.000]   And don't get me wrong.
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:56.760]   You guys know that, yes, the pastors are busy.
[00:38:56.760 --> 00:38:58.880]   I am busy.
[00:38:58.880 --> 00:39:00.680]   The thing is, I am incredibly grateful
[00:39:00.680 --> 00:39:02.560]   because our church people, you guys,
[00:39:02.560 --> 00:39:05.520]   are incredibly considerate of our time.
[00:39:05.520 --> 00:39:08.000]   But on the flip side, I want to use all of it.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:10.560]   I have no issue with people asking to meet up,
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.860]   and et cetera, because I want to use all of it.
[00:39:13.860 --> 00:39:16.700]   But as I took time to reflect, does
[00:39:16.700 --> 00:39:20.880]   that mean I don't have this worrisome angst in my heart?
[00:39:20.880 --> 00:39:23.380]   Like, Lord, there's not enough time
[00:39:23.380 --> 00:39:26.340]   to do everything I want to do.
[00:39:26.340 --> 00:39:28.460]   Is there not in me this desire?
[00:39:28.460 --> 00:39:31.740]   Like, God, I wish there was just like five more hours in the day.
[00:39:31.740 --> 00:39:33.260]   Why'd you make it only 24?
[00:39:33.260 --> 00:39:34.700]   Come on, you know?
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:36.180]   Or just asking in constant-- and I
[00:39:36.180 --> 00:39:38.700]   realized this was actually a constant request in my heart
[00:39:38.700 --> 00:39:42.780]   when I prayed, is I asked God to make me faster, stronger,
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:45.260]   et cetera, et cetera, and more effective so that everything
[00:39:45.260 --> 00:39:46.580]   would just happen.
[00:39:46.580 --> 00:39:48.900]   Do you know what I mean?
[00:39:48.900 --> 00:39:50.940]   And so what I'm sharing with you is
[00:39:50.940 --> 00:39:53.220]   that I had this angst in my heart.
[00:39:53.220 --> 00:39:55.420]   And in the end, it was just worry
[00:39:55.420 --> 00:39:59.060]   that I can't do everything that I want to do.
[00:39:59.060 --> 00:40:00.440]   And then this passage tumbled me.
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:01.860]   Why?
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:05.380]   Because Jesus asked a question.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:09.020]   If you, too, are worried that you don't have enough time
[00:40:09.020 --> 00:40:11.340]   and there is this complaint in your heart,
[00:40:11.340 --> 00:40:13.760]   Jesus said, who of you, by worrying,
[00:40:13.760 --> 00:40:17.420]   can add a single hour to your life?
[00:40:17.420 --> 00:40:18.860]   Let's answer that.
[00:40:18.860 --> 00:40:20.220]   Nobody.
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.240]   And no matter how much we try, we
[00:40:22.240 --> 00:40:24.100]   can't even add a single minute.
[00:40:24.100 --> 00:40:25.660]   And that was so convicting for me.
[00:40:25.660 --> 00:40:26.820]   Why?
[00:40:26.820 --> 00:40:29.420]   Because in the same way that I cannot complain to God
[00:40:29.420 --> 00:40:31.940]   and say, God, why don't you give me more money?
[00:40:31.940 --> 00:40:34.460]   If you gave me more money, that could have served you harder
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:35.940]   and better and stronger.
[00:40:35.940 --> 00:40:38.540]   That sounds so weird, right?
[00:40:38.540 --> 00:40:41.900]   In the same vein, I can't look at God and say, God,
[00:40:41.900 --> 00:40:45.020]   how come you didn't give me enough time?
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:47.780]   If you gave me more time and you gave me faster reading skills
[00:40:47.780 --> 00:40:50.580]   and faster typing skills and et cetera, et cetera,
[00:40:50.580 --> 00:40:54.340]   then I would have, what, glorified you more?
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:55.420]   No.
[00:40:55.420 --> 00:40:57.500]   We have this conviction.
[00:40:57.500 --> 00:41:01.820]   God has given to us everything he deemed necessary.
[00:41:01.820 --> 00:41:04.180]   Amen?
[00:41:04.180 --> 00:41:07.980]   God gave me what he thought was wise,
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:11.260]   enough time by which, by his grace,
[00:41:11.260 --> 00:41:13.980]   he knew what I could handle.
[00:41:13.980 --> 00:41:17.540]   As humbling in one sense, in another sense,
[00:41:17.540 --> 00:41:20.020]   that gives me incredible peace.
[00:41:20.020 --> 00:41:24.740]   Our God, this past year, has given me and to you
[00:41:24.740 --> 00:41:26.460]   all by his sovereign hand.
[00:41:26.460 --> 00:41:28.580]   Amen?
[00:41:28.580 --> 00:41:31.100]   Let's remember that from this passage.
[00:41:31.100 --> 00:41:36.220]   As what is proper in his sight, as what is good in his wisdom,
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:38.620]   God has given to me all.
[00:41:38.620 --> 00:41:43.020]   And if I ever dare complain for more, he might ask me,
[00:41:43.020 --> 00:41:45.740]   but how have you prioritized with what
[00:41:45.740 --> 00:41:48.460]   I've already given you?
[00:41:48.460 --> 00:41:51.940]   How have you made sure that the blessings of community,
[00:41:51.940 --> 00:41:54.500]   the blessings of your energy and your strength and the time
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:41:58.580]   that I've already given you, how have you prioritized it?
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:03.460]   And in this way, I believe and trust God, that he knows
[00:42:03.460 --> 00:42:06.340]   and he gives, period.
[00:42:06.340 --> 00:42:07.780]   That leads me to my second point.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:09.620]   We have to trust him.
[00:42:09.620 --> 00:42:12.260]   And moving a bit more quickly into the second point,
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:15.180]   this is the logic of the passage.
[00:42:15.180 --> 00:42:17.540]   If there is another convicting point from this passage,
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.340]   it is telling us, look.
[00:42:19.340 --> 00:42:21.060]   Look with your eyes.
[00:42:21.060 --> 00:42:25.180]   The birds of the air, they don't have to scurry around.
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:29.460]   But the Lord, the Heavenly Father feeds them.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:30.420]   And look at the lilies.
[00:42:30.420 --> 00:42:33.940]   They're clothed better than King Solomon.
[00:42:33.940 --> 00:42:36.580]   So even though the Gentiles, they
[00:42:36.580 --> 00:42:39.740]   look everywhere in which way for these things,
[00:42:39.740 --> 00:42:43.700]   you have a Heavenly Father who knows and who gives.
[00:42:43.700 --> 00:42:46.580]   This is the confidence of every Christian, amen?
[00:42:46.580 --> 00:42:48.980]   What a wonderful promise.
[00:42:48.980 --> 00:42:51.620]   What a beautiful, beautiful statement
[00:42:51.620 --> 00:42:54.260]   when God says you are more than birds.
[00:42:54.260 --> 00:42:57.340]   You're more than the grass and lilies.
[00:42:57.340 --> 00:43:02.940]   Do you trust that I will give according to my sovereign hand?
[00:43:02.940 --> 00:43:05.780]   And again, I want to make a point of this
[00:43:05.780 --> 00:43:11.220]   and say there is a quick, quick thought that we could have,
[00:43:11.220 --> 00:43:14.940]   which is I know what God is saying,
[00:43:14.940 --> 00:43:19.020]   that if I seek his kingdom, he will provide.
[00:43:19.020 --> 00:43:21.660]   True, 100% true.
[00:43:21.660 --> 00:43:24.740]   But does that mean that every single Christian who
[00:43:24.740 --> 00:43:27.340]   has ever trusted in him will actually, in fact,
[00:43:27.340 --> 00:43:29.540]   have enough food, have enough clothes,
[00:43:29.540 --> 00:43:33.060]   and will never die of starvation?
[00:43:33.060 --> 00:43:36.220]   The answer is no.
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.260]   Many Christians have suffered.
[00:43:38.260 --> 00:43:44.140]   And it's Jesus himself who has said that he has no nest.
[00:43:44.140 --> 00:43:45.300]   He's got no--
[00:43:45.300 --> 00:43:46.140]   foxes have holes.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:48.180]   He doesn't even have a place to rest his head.
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.260]   And he has looked at us and every single disciple
[00:43:50.260 --> 00:43:51.740]   is not greater than his master.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:56.820]   Expect that you will suffer in ways probably worse.
[00:43:56.820 --> 00:43:59.660]   So what is he actually saying?
[00:43:59.660 --> 00:44:03.980]   It's not so much about receiving the things
[00:44:03.980 --> 00:44:06.500]   that the Gentiles look for.
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.260]   It's more about transcending that to receive his kingdom.
[00:44:10.260 --> 00:44:11.180]   Amen?
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.620]   And so with the time I have, I want
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:14.980]   to make sure to drive this point home.
[00:44:14.980 --> 00:44:18.980]   In verse 33 when it says, "But seek his kingdom
[00:44:18.980 --> 00:44:21.140]   and his righteousness."
[00:44:21.140 --> 00:44:23.540]   The priority is God's kingdom.
[00:44:23.540 --> 00:44:27.180]   The priority is his character, his righteousness.
[00:44:27.180 --> 00:44:31.460]   And for those of you guys who are warlords,
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:33.460]   this is God's promise to you.
[00:44:33.460 --> 00:44:35.500]   As you look into the next year--
[00:44:35.500 --> 00:44:37.660]   and maybe some of you guys are sitting here worried
[00:44:37.660 --> 00:44:39.500]   about your careers because you feel like you
[00:44:39.500 --> 00:44:40.940]   have no direction.
[00:44:40.940 --> 00:44:42.660]   Many of you guys are sitting here worried
[00:44:42.660 --> 00:44:45.620]   about your family members because there has been drama
[00:44:45.620 --> 00:44:46.780]   and the bad kind of drama.
[00:44:46.780 --> 00:44:53.620]   When we seek his kingdom, you will worry a lot less.
[00:44:53.620 --> 00:44:55.500]   Amen?
[00:44:55.500 --> 00:44:57.460]   When you make your life first and foremost
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:44:59.540]   about his character, you know you're
[00:44:59.540 --> 00:45:01.540]   at the center of his will because God has said,
[00:45:01.540 --> 00:45:03.620]   it is my will, your sanctification.
[00:45:03.620 --> 00:45:05.940]   1 Thessalonians 4.
[00:45:05.940 --> 00:45:07.260]   What's more, the stuff that we've
[00:45:07.260 --> 00:45:10.820]   been learning about the church, that in God's program,
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:14.020]   he desires for us to be a source of refreshment edification
[00:45:14.020 --> 00:45:16.220]   for the body.
[00:45:16.220 --> 00:45:18.580]   Bless the Lord for this church.
[00:45:18.580 --> 00:45:20.180]   That is part of God's will.
[00:45:20.180 --> 00:45:23.660]   And you know that it is God's will and his priority
[00:45:23.660 --> 00:45:28.420]   that we be lights in his dark, dark generation
[00:45:28.420 --> 00:45:31.980]   where he has made you to be a city on a hill
[00:45:31.980 --> 00:45:34.260]   and you are not supposed to be hiding.
[00:45:34.260 --> 00:45:35.900]   Amen?
[00:45:35.900 --> 00:45:38.500]   As you take a moment to do a brief review of those things
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.380]   that you know to be God's will, what
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:45.780]   is keeping you from being focused?
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:49.780]   How, as a question to you, how, by what means,
[00:45:49.780 --> 00:45:52.140]   in what incremental measure will you
[00:45:52.140 --> 00:45:58.660]   be seeking God's kingdom first in this next year?
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:01.060]   First and foremost, if need be, yes, we
[00:46:01.060 --> 00:46:04.820]   will pray our hearts out so that God will help us put
[00:46:04.820 --> 00:46:08.380]   to the backseat all the things that is taking priority,
[00:46:08.380 --> 00:46:12.940]   my hobbies, my ambition, the stuff that I feel like I need
[00:46:12.940 --> 00:46:16.900]   today, I must have, my longing for this and that,
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:20.180]   all of that stuff needs to take a backseat.
[00:46:20.180 --> 00:46:22.420]   But on the next, when we review and visit
[00:46:22.420 --> 00:46:24.620]   some of these things that you know,
[00:46:24.620 --> 00:46:27.580]   what is going to stir your heart?
[00:46:27.580 --> 00:46:29.900]   For me, as I took time to pray and meditate about this,
[00:46:29.900 --> 00:46:33.900]   I will say I have been so encouraged by our church
[00:46:33.900 --> 00:46:35.540]   this year.
[00:46:35.540 --> 00:46:36.980]   I really have.
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:38.980]   As representative of our outreach team,
[00:46:38.980 --> 00:46:40.860]   I want to thank every single one of you guys.
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:44.140]   This year, whenever we planned an event,
[00:46:44.140 --> 00:46:47.340]   we felt like the church members were constantly bringing out
[00:46:47.340 --> 00:46:49.300]   their family members.
[00:46:49.300 --> 00:46:52.340]   You know, you guys have heard me talk much about our Bible
[00:46:52.340 --> 00:46:53.920]   study newcomers group.
[00:46:53.920 --> 00:46:55.620]   Some of you guys have heard me say this,
[00:46:55.620 --> 00:46:59.340]   but we had over 100 people go through that class this year.
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.300]   And so many times, if I greet somebody and say,
[00:47:01.300 --> 00:47:03.260]   oh, how'd you happen to come by Berean?
[00:47:03.260 --> 00:47:06.420]   They'll say, well, my brother told me I should come.
[00:47:06.420 --> 00:47:08.500]   My sister told me I should come.
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.740]   So many times when we had our boothing outside,
[00:47:10.740 --> 00:47:11.940]   someone would come.
[00:47:11.940 --> 00:47:13.640]   They'd say, oh, how'd you come to Berean?
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:16.620]   It's like, oh, my coworker kept on badgering me.
[00:47:16.620 --> 00:47:20.420]   I see the fruit of we were investing priority
[00:47:20.420 --> 00:47:21.380]   on healthy church.
[00:47:21.380 --> 00:47:23.740]   And when healthy church is moving,
[00:47:23.740 --> 00:47:26.740]   there is witness taking place.
[00:47:26.740 --> 00:47:29.260]   And I have been so stirred because for me,
[00:47:29.260 --> 00:47:34.820]   the scriptures tell us in 2 Timothy chapter 4, verse 5,
[00:47:34.820 --> 00:47:37.460]   that for young Timothy, it says, but you
[00:47:37.460 --> 00:47:39.860]   be sober in all things, endure hardship,
[00:47:39.860 --> 00:47:45.500]   do the work of an evangelist, and fulfill your ministry.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:48.580]   It has been so stirring to my heart
[00:47:48.580 --> 00:47:52.280]   to be able to walk from room to room and in between,
[00:47:52.280 --> 00:47:55.940]   have one of you guys stop me, introduce me to your relative,
[00:47:55.940 --> 00:47:59.380]   and have the sweet joy in sharing the burden of love
[00:47:59.380 --> 00:48:02.780]   to share the gospel with the people you love.
[00:48:02.780 --> 00:48:06.500]   There's nothing more stirring to my heart.
[00:48:06.500 --> 00:48:10.220]   And I pray I can do the same, that whether it's my sons,
[00:48:10.220 --> 00:48:12.220]   I'm walking with them, and I'm talking to you,
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.500]   and you share your testimony with them.
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:18.220]   If I bring any relative, any friend from the past,
[00:48:18.220 --> 00:48:21.420]   that we will be joined in this purpose of sharing
[00:48:21.420 --> 00:48:22.500]   the kingdom of God.
[00:48:22.500 --> 00:48:24.500]   Amen?
[00:48:24.500 --> 00:48:26.980]   And so even if it's not that for you,
[00:48:26.980 --> 00:48:31.580]   in thinking about the next year, the question is, one,
[00:48:31.580 --> 00:48:35.500]   what worries are distracting you?
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:39.780]   What worries have become your deciding criteria,
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:42.780]   trying to stem off all the things that could go wrong,
[00:48:42.780 --> 00:48:45.860]   trying to make sure you're pursuing the security?
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.300]   Let's not move into the next year
[00:48:47.300 --> 00:48:49.940]   with the burden of anxiety on our heart.
[00:48:49.940 --> 00:48:52.700]   But rather, let's think about how
[00:48:52.700 --> 00:48:57.060]   can I, in just a single incremental measure,
[00:48:57.060 --> 00:48:59.300]   seek the kingdom of God?
[00:48:59.300 --> 00:49:02.780]   How can I, in one single incremental measure,
[00:49:02.780 --> 00:49:05.460]   seek the righteous character of my God,
[00:49:05.460 --> 00:49:09.180]   that I would bear his image and be unto this world
[00:49:09.180 --> 00:49:10.820]   a great light for his glory?
[00:49:10.820 --> 00:49:11.500]   Amen?
[00:49:11.500 --> 00:49:12.020]   Let's pray.
[00:49:12.020 --> 00:49:20.620]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God,
[00:49:20.620 --> 00:49:24.220]   for the challenge of the words of our Lord.
[00:49:24.220 --> 00:49:26.820]   Thank you for your mercy upon us.
[00:49:26.820 --> 00:49:30.300]   God, we feel your incredible loving mercy,
[00:49:30.300 --> 00:49:32.820]   where you would tend to the worries and anxieties
[00:49:32.820 --> 00:49:35.580]   of your disciples.
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:39.220]   Father God, I pray that you will strengthen our faith.
[00:49:39.220 --> 00:49:43.980]   Lord, we confess we are people beset with fears and worries.
[00:49:43.980 --> 00:49:46.460]   But God, when we draw closer to the Lord,
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:50.780]   help all of those fears to subside and disappear.
[00:49:50.780 --> 00:49:54.660]   I pray, Father God, that we'll live with incredible confidence
[00:49:54.660 --> 00:49:56.060]   in the Lord.
[00:49:56.060 --> 00:49:58.580]   I pray, Father God, that we would have great ambition
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:00.140]   for your kingdom.
[00:50:00.140 --> 00:50:03.340]   And I ask, God, that we will be a church characterized
[00:50:03.340 --> 00:50:07.220]   by incredible trust and prayer, but also incredible strength
[00:50:07.220 --> 00:50:09.260]   as a fruit of that prayer.
[00:50:09.260 --> 00:50:11.580]   We thank you, Lord, and ask for your spiritual blessing
[00:50:11.580 --> 00:50:12.940]   in this next year.
[00:50:12.940 --> 00:50:14.160]   It's in Christ's name.
[00:50:14.160 --> 00:50:16.180]   Amen.
[00:50:16.180 --> 00:50:20.540]   All right, at this time, I want to encourage all of you
[00:50:20.540 --> 00:50:24.300]   to just bundle up, either within your family groups,
[00:50:24.300 --> 00:50:28.060]   or just turn to your neighbor in groups of three to four
[00:50:28.060 --> 00:50:29.780]   and take some time to pray.
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:34.780]   Because we only have about 10 minutes before 12 o'clock hits,
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:38.660]   please take time to briefly share just like a thing, OK?
[00:50:38.660 --> 00:50:40.500]   What are your biggest worries that
[00:50:40.500 --> 00:50:44.620]   has been kind of plaguing your mind, that may potentially
[00:50:44.620 --> 00:50:48.060]   wreak havoc on some of your focus next year?
[00:50:48.060 --> 00:50:50.560]   And then let's think about what incremental step
[00:50:50.560 --> 00:50:53.540]   I can take to seek God's kingdom more, OK?
[00:50:53.540 --> 00:50:56.540]   So I'm going to give you guys about 10 minutes.
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:58.300]   We'll draw our attention back.
[00:50:58.300 --> 00:51:00.220]   We'll do the countdown together.
[00:51:00.220 --> 00:51:03.140]   And then at the end of it, we'll sing a closing song, OK?
[00:51:03.140 --> 00:51:04.900]   So please go ahead, take initiative,
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:07.020]   look to your neighbor, and take some time to pray.
