[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.120]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 9, and I'm going to again, for review,
[00:00:11.120 --> 00:00:13.120]   read verse 6 through 13.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:15.560]   As Elder Joe read that, I want to read that one more time.
[00:00:15.560 --> 00:00:18.880]   Romans chapter 9, verse 6 through 13.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:25.440]   "But it is not as though the word of God has failed, for not all who are descended from
[00:00:25.440 --> 00:00:27.440]   Israel belong to Israel.
[00:00:27.440 --> 00:00:30.640]   Not all are children of Abraham, because they are his offspring.
[00:00:30.640 --> 00:00:33.440]   But through Isaac shall your offspring be named.
[00:00:33.440 --> 00:00:37.000]   This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God, but
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:39.760]   the children of the promise are counted as offspring.
[00:00:39.760 --> 00:00:44.600]   For this is what the promise said, 'About this time next year I will return, and Sarah
[00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:45.680]   shall have a son.'
[00:00:45.680 --> 00:00:50.520]   And not only so, but also when Rebecca had conceived children by one man, our forefather
[00:00:50.520 --> 00:00:51.520]   Isaac.
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:55.200]   Though they were not yet born, and had done nothing, either good or bad, in order that
[00:00:55.200 --> 00:00:59.760]   God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of him who
[00:00:59.760 --> 00:01:00.960]   calls.
[00:01:00.960 --> 00:01:05.160]   She was told, 'The older will serve the younger,' as it is written, 'Jacob I love, but Esau
[00:01:05.160 --> 00:01:06.160]   I hated.'"
[00:01:06.160 --> 00:01:07.160]   Let's pray.
[00:01:07.160 --> 00:01:17.040]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you for this morning, and as we search your Word and
[00:01:17.040 --> 00:01:22.560]   take time, Lord God, for communion, I pray that you would enlighten and ready our hearts.
[00:01:22.560 --> 00:01:29.080]   Help us Lord God, with all the distractions in our lives, to fixate our eyes upon Christ,
[00:01:29.080 --> 00:01:31.320]   author and perfecter of our faith.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:37.200]   We thank you for your patience, we thank you for election, and we pray Father God that
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:42.480]   as we wrestle with this text, help us to understand and glean your meaning, not just through our
[00:01:42.480 --> 00:01:47.480]   mind, but our very wills and our lives will be changed the more and more we are exposed
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.840]   to your Word.
[00:01:48.840 --> 00:01:51.920]   And so we pray for your Holy Spirit to guide us, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:51.920 --> 00:01:59.640]   Let me ask you a quick question, how many of you know the name Ryrie, Dr. Ryrie?
[00:01:59.640 --> 00:02:02.320]   Okay maybe one or two of you.
[00:02:02.320 --> 00:02:07.880]   Dr. Ryrie, he was a pretty prominent theologian when I was younger, when I was going through
[00:02:07.880 --> 00:02:13.400]   a Bible major undergrad in seminary, Dr. Ryrie was the key theologian behind the dispensation
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:14.400]   of theology.
[00:02:14.400 --> 00:02:18.640]   Again, so I'm not going to go into details of what that is, but you know that in modern
[00:02:18.640 --> 00:02:23.080]   era you have the ESV study Bible, before that there was a Reformation study Bible, the MacArthur
[00:02:23.080 --> 00:02:28.560]   study Bible, the NIV study Bible, so in different eras there are different study Bibles that
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:29.560]   were very popular.
[00:02:29.560 --> 00:02:34.880]   Well, prior to the NIV study Bible, Dr. Ryrie's study Bible was probably the most popular
[00:02:34.880 --> 00:02:36.920]   study Bible that people used.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:41.480]   And so his name, even to this day, if you read a lot of commentaries, his name will
[00:02:41.480 --> 00:02:45.720]   come up when dispensational theology, the traditional dispensational theology comes
[00:02:45.720 --> 00:02:46.920]   up.
[00:02:46.920 --> 00:02:53.440]   So when I was undergrad, I was able to take a class that was taught by his daughter.
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:58.700]   And so I was really excited because I was a Bible major and I was studying about dispensational
[00:02:58.700 --> 00:03:02.920]   theology, so when I heard that his daughter was teaching a class, it wasn't a theology
[00:03:02.920 --> 00:03:05.740]   class, it was business statistics.
[00:03:05.740 --> 00:03:09.480]   And so we were in there and I remember like man, getting the opportunity to talk to her
[00:03:09.480 --> 00:03:14.400]   and talk to her about her dad and I just remember that as soon as her dad's name came up, the
[00:03:14.400 --> 00:03:19.160]   first thing that she said is, "I know nothing of the theology, so don't ask me."
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.080]   So it seemed like she was almost annoyed that everybody would come in thinking that she
[00:03:23.080 --> 00:03:27.280]   at least gleaned some of the theology off of her father, but that's the first thing
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:31.640]   that she told us, she's like, "I know nothing about dispensationalism, so don't ask me."
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:32.640]   You know?
[00:03:32.640 --> 00:03:33.640]   And then that kind of squashed it.
[00:03:33.640 --> 00:03:38.080]   And I remember some of us who were Bible majors were so disappointed because we were, we thought
[00:03:38.080 --> 00:03:43.520]   like oh, we get front row seats and maybe we can ask her about this man.
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:48.160]   But again, we were disappointed because we thought she had the opportunity, I mean she
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:53.000]   was raised in a home where theology was rich, her father's name is being quoted in all the
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:58.320]   theological books and commentaries and yet she gained nothing from it.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.800]   Every once in a while you'll hear about sports stars, that they had millions of dollars and
[00:04:03.800 --> 00:04:08.200]   they gained tens of millions, sometimes hundreds of millions, and then after they finished
[00:04:08.200 --> 00:04:16.560]   their sports and career, you find them just in bankruptcy and it makes you wonder what
[00:04:16.560 --> 00:04:18.920]   happened to all that money?
[00:04:18.920 --> 00:04:20.480]   What did they do, make a bad investment?
[00:04:20.480 --> 00:04:27.640]   How come they were so blessed financially and to be that far away from financial security?
[00:04:27.640 --> 00:04:33.840]   Well Apostle Paul described the nation of Israel as being as blessed as you can possibly
[00:04:33.840 --> 00:04:35.060]   imagine.
[00:04:35.060 --> 00:04:41.480]   In Romans 9, 4-5, Paul says of the nation of Israel, "They are Israelites, to them belong
[00:04:41.480 --> 00:04:47.720]   the adoption, they have the glory, the covenant, the giving of the law, the worship, and the
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   promises.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:52.840]   To them belong the patriarchs and from their race, according to the flesh, is the Christ
[00:04:52.840 --> 00:04:56.480]   who is God over all, blessed forever."
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:02.640]   The reason why Paul said that in Romans 9, 4-5 is because they were, to nullify the message
[00:05:02.640 --> 00:05:08.640]   of the cross, some people were saying, Apostle Paul must have hated his own people.
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:12.320]   That maybe he has something against the Jews, maybe something went wrong and that's why
[00:05:12.320 --> 00:05:15.400]   he's preaching a gospel that seems so offensive to the Jews.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.200]   And in defense he says, "No, that is not it at all.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:23.320]   If I was able to, I would rather be accursed than my countrymen."
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:28.120]   In fact, he says of the nation of Israel, "We are so blessed.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:33.480]   God gave us the covenant, they had front row seats to all of his miracles.
[00:05:33.480 --> 00:05:38.320]   They were the first recipients of special revelation of God's law.
[00:05:38.320 --> 00:05:44.160]   Their temple worship, every single day that they went, revealed an aspect about Christ.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.400]   Their sacrificial system was to prepare for the coming of the sacrifice of Christ.
[00:05:49.400 --> 00:05:56.320]   No other nation had the front row seat to the glory of God than the nation of Israel.
[00:05:56.320 --> 00:06:03.400]   And yet, when Christ, the Messiah that they've been waiting for, for hundreds of years, standing
[00:06:03.400 --> 00:06:09.880]   before them, after performing miracles, after miracles, walking on water, calming storms,
[00:06:09.880 --> 00:06:16.760]   and even raising people from the dead, they were so completely blind to who he is, and
[00:06:16.760 --> 00:06:19.040]   they just walked away from him.
[00:06:19.040 --> 00:06:23.600]   In John chapter 1, 9-11, it says, "The true light which enlightens everyone was coming
[00:06:23.600 --> 00:06:24.960]   into the world.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:29.460]   He was in the world and the world was made through him, yet the world did not know him.
[00:06:29.460 --> 00:06:34.280]   He came to his own and his own people did not receive him."
[00:06:34.280 --> 00:06:39.680]   Now, we're removed from what happened 2,000 years ago, and we can easily look at that
[00:06:39.680 --> 00:06:43.440]   and say, you know, these Jewish people, how could they have been so blind?
[00:06:43.440 --> 00:06:48.360]   If Jesus performed miracles in front of my eyes, I don't think I would have been so blind.
[00:06:48.360 --> 00:06:52.160]   If I had the law and I had the glory, I was able to see the glory and the covenant and
[00:06:52.160 --> 00:06:58.880]   all the patriarchs came from my own people, maybe I wouldn't have been so blind.
[00:06:58.880 --> 00:07:04.400]   But the truth of the matter is, the statistics even today, you and I live in a post-Christian
[00:07:04.400 --> 00:07:09.240]   culture, meaning Christianity is saturated in our money, it's in our constitution, it's
[00:07:09.240 --> 00:07:13.640]   in our education, and I know that we have an element in our generation that's trying
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:19.920]   to weed a lot of this stuff out, and there's a resistance against that, but this nation
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:26.400]   is a post-Christian culture where many Christians that went before us have embedded the gospel
[00:07:26.400 --> 00:07:31.460]   message and the presence of God in so much of what we're doing.
[00:07:31.460 --> 00:07:38.400]   It's in the judiciary system, it's in the money, it's in the education, but because
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:45.360]   we live in a post-Christian culture, there's a tendency for us to become numb to the truth.
[00:07:45.360 --> 00:07:51.880]   You know, if you never heard the gospel message, and imagine, I know a lot of you guys, you
[00:07:51.880 --> 00:07:56.840]   heard the message since you were a little kid, so when we talk about Christ crucified,
[00:07:56.840 --> 00:08:01.120]   I mean you've probably heard that, I don't know, tens of thousands of times.
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:05.560]   This message, what you're doing this morning, you've done this for maybe decades, some of
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:07.640]   you.
[00:08:07.640 --> 00:08:11.520]   And so as a result of that, you become numb, it's become very predictable.
[00:08:11.520 --> 00:08:14.600]   The songs, there's nothing new.
[00:08:14.600 --> 00:08:19.800]   You're always kind of looking for a new edge, something different.
[00:08:19.800 --> 00:08:23.800]   But we become, for the most part, numb to the things that we sing, numb to the things
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.600]   that we profess.
[00:08:26.600 --> 00:08:31.720]   I think it's extremely important that every once in a while we take a seat and take some
[00:08:31.720 --> 00:08:33.080]   time to think.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:38.000]   If you are a non-Christian, never heard the gospel message, and you heard the gospel message
[00:08:38.000 --> 00:08:41.720]   for the first time, some of you may remember that.
[00:08:41.720 --> 00:08:45.680]   If you became a Christian later in life, and somebody brought the gospel to you, some of
[00:08:45.680 --> 00:08:49.720]   you may remember what it was like when you first heard the gospel, and what your response
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:51.080]   was.
[00:08:51.080 --> 00:08:55.840]   Whether good or bad, whether you were angry or not angry, confused, you may remember all
[00:08:55.840 --> 00:08:56.920]   of that.
[00:08:56.920 --> 00:09:00.880]   And I know there's a lot of you don't remember any of it because you were raised in a Christian
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   home.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:06.120]   You don't remember a single time in your life where the gospel was not in your family in
[00:09:06.120 --> 00:09:08.520]   some way.
[00:09:08.520 --> 00:09:15.440]   In any other case, as time passes by, there's always a danger of becoming numb to the truth,
[00:09:15.440 --> 00:09:19.600]   and when we become numb to the truth, we become blind.
[00:09:19.600 --> 00:09:23.040]   The nation of Israel did not become blind.
[00:09:23.040 --> 00:09:27.960]   Just all of a sudden one day decided, you know what, I'm going to walk away from God.
[00:09:27.960 --> 00:09:30.520]   That's not what happened.
[00:09:30.520 --> 00:09:36.600]   Years and years of neglect, drifting, pursuing things that had nothing to do with God.
[00:09:36.600 --> 00:09:43.600]   Eventually, spiritually, they became blind, so blind that a man who walked on water, who
[00:09:43.600 --> 00:09:48.400]   fed them miraculous food, who raises Lazarus from the dead, standing before them, and they
[00:09:48.400 --> 00:09:52.080]   reject him.
[00:09:52.080 --> 00:09:59.520]   The danger that you and I live in, in a post-Christian culture, one, if you're raising children in
[00:09:59.520 --> 00:10:05.360]   a home where you're teaching them BBS, you're diligent in bringing them to Sunday school,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:10.800]   you know, Os Guinness wrote a book about the different generations of Christianity.
[00:10:10.800 --> 00:10:17.320]   It said first generation usually that receives revival or receives Christ, second generation
[00:10:17.320 --> 00:10:18.320]   becomes nominal.
[00:10:18.320 --> 00:10:23.360]   Again, this is not 100%, but typical thing that you see in society.
[00:10:23.360 --> 00:10:29.880]   Second generation becomes nominal, and then third generation is apostate.
[00:10:29.880 --> 00:10:36.440]   The predominant experience in Christianity is children who are raised in Christian homes
[00:10:36.440 --> 00:10:41.080]   don't become passionate for Christ.
[00:10:41.080 --> 00:10:44.920]   I know every single one of us, if you're the first generation Christian in your home, you're
[00:10:44.920 --> 00:10:48.560]   doing everything in your power that your children is exposed to the gospel, they're going to
[00:10:48.560 --> 00:10:50.840]   be raised in a home that loves Christ.
[00:10:50.840 --> 00:10:55.640]   But again, I'm just telling you statistically, predominantly children who are raised in Christian
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:11:00.800]   homes walk away from their faith.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:06.000]   And I think part of the reason is, has to do with us.
[00:11:06.000 --> 00:11:08.200]   Part of the reason has to do with us.
[00:11:08.200 --> 00:11:11.160]   And the reason why is because after we've been a Christian for a while, we've learned
[00:11:11.160 --> 00:11:13.360]   to play the game.
[00:11:13.360 --> 00:11:15.320]   We know what songs to sing.
[00:11:15.320 --> 00:11:16.520]   We know how to get organized.
[00:11:16.520 --> 00:11:18.800]   We know what to do in the church we serve.
[00:11:18.800 --> 00:11:24.400]   But our children see something very disingenuous.
[00:11:24.400 --> 00:11:27.800]   They see the words that we speak, they see the things that we do, but our faith is not
[00:11:27.800 --> 00:11:29.720]   real.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:33.720]   And so we may pretend that church, but when we go at home, they see what's behind the
[00:11:33.720 --> 00:11:35.760]   scene that the faith is not real.
[00:11:35.760 --> 00:11:41.000]   And so what we inadvertently do is raise children who are nominal Christians.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:46.560]   They know how to play the game, but they never had a personal relationship with God.
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:49.680]   Israel had generations of this.
[00:11:49.680 --> 00:11:50.920]   They had generations of this.
[00:11:50.920 --> 00:11:57.240]   So by the time Christ came, they were so numb spiritually that they could not see their
[00:11:57.240 --> 00:12:00.140]   own Messiah standing before them.
[00:12:00.140 --> 00:12:04.160]   The context in which this passage is written, Paul's been talking about God's sovereignty,
[00:12:04.160 --> 00:12:07.880]   how Israel is not going to be saved because of their works.
[00:12:07.880 --> 00:12:09.240]   It's not because of their heritage.
[00:12:09.240 --> 00:12:13.640]   It's by faith when they repent of their sins, just like the rest of the world.
[00:12:13.640 --> 00:12:17.920]   So the natural question that's going to come up, if God is sovereign and he made a covenant
[00:12:17.920 --> 00:12:25.160]   with the nation of Israel and he made a promise to Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, and he's a
[00:12:25.160 --> 00:12:29.080]   sovereign God and he was a sovereign God who keeps his promises, at least that's what we
[00:12:29.080 --> 00:12:30.080]   are taught.
[00:12:30.080 --> 00:12:35.320]   Then the natural question is, if Israel has failed and they don't recognize their Messiah,
[00:12:35.320 --> 00:12:37.360]   then has God failed?
[00:12:37.360 --> 00:12:40.520]   Isn't that God's fault?
[00:12:40.520 --> 00:12:42.920]   That's the question that Paul is trying to answer in verse six.
[00:12:42.920 --> 00:12:47.040]   It is not as though the word of God has failed.
[00:12:47.040 --> 00:12:51.360]   It is not as though the word of God has failed.
[00:12:51.360 --> 00:12:55.200]   Hebrews chapter six, four through eight, you don't need to turn your Bibles there.
[00:12:55.200 --> 00:12:57.720]   The author of Hebrews is answering that same question.
[00:12:57.720 --> 00:13:02.640]   Here's a group of people, maybe third generation Christians, who are beginning to drift back
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:04.960]   into Judaism.
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:09.280]   And so the author is writing to them, warning them that there's only salvation in the name
[00:13:09.280 --> 00:13:10.280]   of Christ.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.160]   If you drift back into your old way of life, there is no salvation.
[00:13:14.160 --> 00:13:15.360]   So this is the way he puts it.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.200]   Again, some of you guys may be very familiar with this text and when you read it, you may
[00:13:19.200 --> 00:13:23.640]   be confused, but let me read this text to you and again, try to explain it where you
[00:13:23.640 --> 00:13:25.600]   can understand the context and the meaning.
[00:13:25.600 --> 00:13:27.520]   Hebrews six, four, three.
[00:13:27.520 --> 00:13:32.920]   For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been enlightened, who
[00:13:32.920 --> 00:13:37.200]   have tasted the heavenly gift, who have shared in the Holy Spirit and have tasted the goodness
[00:13:37.200 --> 00:13:41.020]   of the word of God and the powers of the age to come.
[00:13:41.020 --> 00:13:45.320]   If they then fall away, since they are crucifying once again, the son of God to their own heart,
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:49.440]   I'm holding him to holding him up to contempt.
[00:13:49.440 --> 00:13:51.080]   Let me stop right there.
[00:13:51.080 --> 00:13:56.120]   He describes an individual who has tasted the goodness of God, who shared in the Holy
[00:13:56.120 --> 00:13:59.640]   Spirit, who have tasted the heavenly gift.
[00:13:59.640 --> 00:14:04.720]   And on the surface, it sounds like a Christian because he's tasted the Holy Spirit.
[00:14:04.720 --> 00:14:07.040]   He tasted the goodness of God.
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:14.060]   But he says if he fails, if he fails to repent, it is it is impossible to restore him to repentance.
[00:14:14.060 --> 00:14:20.720]   So some people have taken that text and say, well, it sounds like if you fail that you,
[00:14:20.720 --> 00:14:22.760]   God will not receive you, your repentance.
[00:14:22.760 --> 00:14:26.560]   Obviously, that contradicts everything else that we see in scripture.
[00:14:26.560 --> 00:14:28.520]   Clearly that is not what he is saying in Hebrews six.
[00:14:28.520 --> 00:14:32.400]   So I want you to continue reading with me in verse seven.
[00:14:32.400 --> 00:14:37.720]   He says, for the land that has drunk the rain that often falls on it and produces a crop
[00:14:37.720 --> 00:14:42.800]   useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated, receives a blessing from God.
[00:14:42.800 --> 00:14:48.000]   If it bears thorns and thistles, it's worthless and near to be cursed and its end is to be
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   burned.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:54.600]   So you notice the illustration that he gives between somebody who has received the goodness
[00:14:54.600 --> 00:14:57.440]   of God, which he's talking about the rain.
[00:14:57.440 --> 00:15:02.400]   Like so all have have received this rain, this grace of God, and some of them received
[00:15:02.400 --> 00:15:08.000]   it and bore fruit and some of them received it and they rejected it, had for no fruit
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:13.100]   and they are worthless according to the scriptures and they will be judged.
[00:15:13.100 --> 00:15:20.200]   So what he is saying here in this text is all had the opportunity to hear God's word.
[00:15:20.200 --> 00:15:21.200]   All of them had the opportunity.
[00:15:21.200 --> 00:15:26.240]   He's talking about people who are in the church, who are around the preaching, participate
[00:15:26.240 --> 00:15:31.780]   in communion, maybe even Sunday school teachers, maybe even pastors.
[00:15:31.780 --> 00:15:37.700]   That the word of God, they had every opportunity to repent and come to Christ, but they never
[00:15:37.700 --> 00:15:38.700]   did it.
[00:15:38.700 --> 00:15:43.040]   And so these people that Paul or the author is specifically talking to are talking about
[00:15:43.040 --> 00:15:46.200]   people who who've experienced it, who have observed it.
[00:15:46.200 --> 00:15:49.160]   They can even tell you about what they've observed.
[00:15:49.160 --> 00:15:54.640]   And at one point they may have, they may have even seemed like Christians, but they're returning
[00:15:54.640 --> 00:15:58.040]   back to their old life and bearing no fruit.
[00:15:58.040 --> 00:16:03.040]   Let me, let me show you another passage in second Timothy two, 11 to 13.
[00:16:03.040 --> 00:16:06.840]   You don't need to turn your Bibles there, but here's a passage that is often quoted
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   out of context.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:16.000]   Verse 13, if we are faithless, he will remain faithful, comforting, right?
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:17.720]   Very comforting.
[00:16:17.720 --> 00:16:23.160]   How many times have we found ourselves to be faithless, to be caught in sin, to drift
[00:16:23.160 --> 00:16:27.760]   away and to be reminded that no matter how faithless you are, God will always remain
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:28.760]   faithful.
[00:16:28.760 --> 00:16:31.640]   Now, is that statement true?
[00:16:31.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   Absolutely it's true.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:33.640]   I just read it.
[00:16:33.640 --> 00:16:34.640]   It's in the scripture.
[00:16:34.640 --> 00:16:40.420]   But when you take that verse out of context and you begin to create this theology of who
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:47.000]   God is and who Christ is outside of the context of which Paul is saying this, you can have
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:51.220]   a lopsided view of the, of the doctrine of grace.
[00:16:51.220 --> 00:16:55.800]   I want you, I want you to read the whole context of this in second Timothy two, 11, 13 says
[00:16:55.800 --> 00:17:01.680]   the saying is trustworthy for if we have died with him, we will also live with him.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:04.880]   If we endure, we will also reign with him.
[00:17:04.880 --> 00:17:09.660]   If we deny him, he also will deny us.
[00:17:09.660 --> 00:17:14.460]   If we are faithless, he remains faithful.
[00:17:14.460 --> 00:17:19.260]   You have to read verse 13 along with verse 12.
[00:17:19.260 --> 00:17:24.000]   If you only choose to read verse 13 is you, and this is part of the reason why we've created
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:30.500]   a culture in our generation of church goers who are living in sin and absolute assurance
[00:17:30.500 --> 00:17:32.860]   that they have salvation.
[00:17:32.860 --> 00:17:35.900]   And you ask them why it's because they were raised in a Christian home.
[00:17:35.900 --> 00:17:41.660]   They went down on altar, they went to harvest crusade or, or they have some reason, but
[00:17:41.660 --> 00:17:43.900]   it's not genuine faith.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:46.920]   See what Paul means here.
[00:17:46.920 --> 00:17:50.240]   He says, if we deny him, we don't believe him.
[00:17:50.240 --> 00:17:51.460]   We don't repent of our sins.
[00:17:51.460 --> 00:17:55.100]   We know we have no intention of following him.
[00:17:55.100 --> 00:18:00.900]   And the end result is you will find that you have been denied by Christ.
[00:18:00.900 --> 00:18:02.260]   So what does it mean in verse 13?
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:05.700]   If we are faithless, he will remain faithful.
[00:18:05.700 --> 00:18:12.180]   No matter how faithless we become, no matter how unreliable our promises become, God remains
[00:18:12.180 --> 00:18:14.900]   faithful to who?
[00:18:14.900 --> 00:18:18.020]   To himself.
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:24.540]   When God says that he will deliver us from our sins, he will keep that promise.
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:29.900]   But when he also says that there will be condemnation for everyone who rejects, he will also keep
[00:18:29.900 --> 00:18:31.660]   that promise.
[00:18:31.660 --> 00:18:36.220]   That God's promises are a hundred percent reliable one way or the other.
[00:18:36.220 --> 00:18:39.300]   That's what he means in verse 13.
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:44.620]   That he will be faithful to himself through and through throughout generation to generation.
[00:18:44.620 --> 00:18:49.500]   He's that verse 13 is not saying that no matter what you do, no matter how rebellious you
[00:18:49.500 --> 00:18:53.840]   are, you have no intention of following Christ and continue to live in disobedience.
[00:18:53.840 --> 00:18:56.460]   It doesn't matter because God will remain faithful to you.
[00:18:56.460 --> 00:18:58.580]   God will forgive you whether you repent or not.
[00:18:58.580 --> 00:19:00.580]   God will forgive you.
[00:19:00.580 --> 00:19:04.500]   That is not the meaning of this text.
[00:19:04.500 --> 00:19:07.380]   Why is this so important?
[00:19:07.380 --> 00:19:13.080]   It's important because basically that's what Paul is trying to say in this text.
[00:19:13.080 --> 00:19:14.080]   They fell away.
[00:19:14.080 --> 00:19:18.420]   If God made a promise to the nation of Israel, and now you're saying they're under condemnation,
[00:19:18.420 --> 00:19:23.320]   even though God made a covenant with Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, then is God changing his
[00:19:23.320 --> 00:19:26.920]   mind or has his word failed?
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.040]   He's not keeping his promise?
[00:19:29.040 --> 00:19:30.040]   Is it by no means?
[00:19:30.040 --> 00:19:34.120]   In fact, he gives the primary reason.
[00:19:34.120 --> 00:19:40.920]   And then he gives two illustrations of Isaac and Ishmael and Jacob and Esau to prove his
[00:19:40.920 --> 00:19:46.560]   point that God's intent always was salvation by faith and by his promise.
[00:19:46.560 --> 00:19:49.900]   So in verse six and seven, this is what he says in answer to that God has not failed
[00:19:49.900 --> 00:19:51.380]   his promise.
[00:19:51.380 --> 00:19:53.840]   He's not breaking his covenant with the nation of Israel.
[00:19:53.840 --> 00:19:54.840]   This is how he explains it.
[00:19:54.840 --> 00:19:59.480]   Verse six, for not all who are descendants from Israel belong to Israel.
[00:19:59.480 --> 00:20:03.740]   Not all are children of Abraham because they are his offspring.
[00:20:03.740 --> 00:20:07.180]   So let me interpret that in the context of what Paul is saying.
[00:20:07.180 --> 00:20:08.620]   God did not change his mind.
[00:20:08.620 --> 00:20:13.540]   He's not moving on to plan B. His covenant and his promises that he made to the nation
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:16.240]   of Israel is consistent.
[00:20:16.240 --> 00:20:23.200]   The problem is you think that the promise is for you because you were born into a particular
[00:20:23.200 --> 00:20:29.980]   nation, because you went to the temple, because you have these outward appearance of being
[00:20:29.980 --> 00:20:33.560]   a child of God because you were circumcised.
[00:20:33.560 --> 00:20:39.460]   Imagine how mind-blowing this is to a Jew that for decades and for centuries, no matter
[00:20:39.460 --> 00:20:44.840]   how hard life got, they reminded each other, at least we're Israelites.
[00:20:44.840 --> 00:20:47.520]   God said that he's going to be faithful to us.
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:48.760]   We are the apple of his eye.
[00:20:48.760 --> 00:20:52.340]   Why would God bring any harm to us?
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:57.240]   So when the pagan nations took over and the Romans and the Greeks and the Persians and
[00:20:57.240 --> 00:21:02.640]   the Babylonians and the Assyrians came in and oppressed them, the encouragement that
[00:21:02.640 --> 00:21:06.560]   they gave to each other, we are God's people.
[00:21:06.560 --> 00:21:08.580]   God will not abandon us.
[00:21:08.580 --> 00:21:09.980]   Maybe if we just keep the law.
[00:21:09.980 --> 00:21:13.280]   Maybe if we did a better job of keeping the Sabbath.
[00:21:13.280 --> 00:21:14.720]   So that was their security blanket.
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:20.120]   And all of a sudden, the apostle Paul says, you're completely mistaken.
[00:21:20.120 --> 00:21:23.320]   Not all of you are recipients of God's promise.
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:29.120]   When God made this covenant, you may not be a recipient of that promise.
[00:21:29.120 --> 00:21:31.100]   God didn't change his plan.
[00:21:31.100 --> 00:21:32.100]   You misunderstood.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.360]   In fact, this idea is not new.
[00:21:34.360 --> 00:21:38.360]   Paul's been saying this in Romans chapter 228, for no one is a Jew who is merely one
[00:21:38.360 --> 00:21:39.360]   outwardly.
[00:21:39.360 --> 00:21:44.040]   Nor is circumcision outward and physical, but a Jew is one inwardly and circumcision
[00:21:44.040 --> 00:21:45.040]   is a matter of the heart.
[00:21:45.040 --> 00:21:50.560]   In other words, the physical circumcision has nothing to do with your salvation.
[00:21:50.560 --> 00:21:51.560]   Not by the letter.
[00:21:51.560 --> 00:21:55.240]   His praise is not from man, but from God.
[00:21:55.240 --> 00:22:02.160]   In fact, this idea, this false security that these Jews were holding onto was the primary
[00:22:02.160 --> 00:22:06.960]   thing that Jesus was trying to break.
[00:22:06.960 --> 00:22:12.400]   Until he broke into their false security, they would never come to Christ and cling
[00:22:12.400 --> 00:22:14.520]   to the gospel.
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:22.080]   As long as their security is external righteousness, they would never come to Christ in desperation.
[00:22:22.080 --> 00:22:27.000]   So in order to bring the gospel to them, he needed to break that confidence.
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:32.080]   That's why it says in Matthew 3, 9-10, it says, "And do not presume to say to yourselves,
[00:22:32.080 --> 00:22:35.880]   we have Abraham as our father, for I tell you, God is able from these stones to raise
[00:22:35.880 --> 00:22:38.680]   up children from Abraham."
[00:22:38.680 --> 00:22:43.320]   Your confidence in your heritage is unwarranted.
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:50.120]   God is not obligated to you or to us because of our heritage, because of our parents, because
[00:22:50.120 --> 00:22:54.880]   of what we've done in the past, or even what we're doing now.
[00:22:54.880 --> 00:22:57.440]   Even now, the axe is laid to the root of the tree.
[00:22:57.440 --> 00:23:01.520]   Every tree, therefore, that does not bear good fruit is cut down and thrown into the
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:02.520]   fire.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:07.400]   As some of you guys know, I'm a third generation pastor in my family.
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:11.640]   My grandfather was a pastor, my father was a pastor, I'm a third generation pastor.
[00:23:11.640 --> 00:23:15.520]   So typically people think, "Oh, no wonder you became a pastor."
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:20.020]   And then so now, who's going to be the pastor in my family, since we are the family of Levites?
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:22.040]   So who's going to be the next Levites?
[00:23:22.040 --> 00:23:23.520]   Who's going to carry the poles?
[00:23:23.520 --> 00:23:29.920]   Well, I mean, as I've mentioned to you many times, even though I grew up in a Christian
[00:23:29.920 --> 00:23:35.000]   home, you could have asked me before I became a Christian, "Am I going to go to heaven?"
[00:23:35.000 --> 00:23:39.520]   I would have told you yes, because I grew up at church.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:44.200]   I heard Sunday school, I memorized scripture, went to the VBSs.
[00:23:44.200 --> 00:23:46.720]   I can't remember a single Sunday that I missed church.
[00:23:46.720 --> 00:23:51.080]   No matter how sick I was, my dad was, "You have to go to church.
[00:23:51.080 --> 00:23:54.920]   Even if you're coughing up blood, just sit in the front row, and then we'll just leave
[00:23:54.920 --> 00:23:55.920]   early."
[00:23:55.920 --> 00:23:56.920]   And so that got embedded.
[00:23:56.920 --> 00:23:58.760]   I'm thankful that that got embedded in me.
[00:23:58.760 --> 00:24:01.800]   It took church seriously.
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:03.840]   But if you asked me, was I saved?
[00:24:03.840 --> 00:24:06.240]   I really don't know what that meant, but I would have told you yes.
[00:24:06.240 --> 00:24:07.880]   Do I believe in God?
[00:24:07.880 --> 00:24:08.880]   Yes.
[00:24:08.880 --> 00:24:12.760]   If you asked me to recite the gospel, I wouldn't be able to tell you the details of the gospel,
[00:24:12.760 --> 00:24:16.400]   but I would have been able to tell you a Sunday school version of it.
[00:24:16.400 --> 00:24:19.680]   Jesus loves me, this I know, for the Bible tells me so.
[00:24:19.680 --> 00:24:22.320]   Jesus died for my sins.
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:27.840]   I could have told you that, because I was taught that since I was a little kid.
[00:24:27.840 --> 00:24:30.320]   But I was not saved.
[00:24:30.320 --> 00:24:31.400]   I was not saved.
[00:24:31.400 --> 00:24:37.760]   If I remained in that state, if I died, I would have met a God who was going to judge
[00:24:37.760 --> 00:24:39.280]   me for my sins.
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:40.280]   I did not know him.
[00:24:40.280 --> 00:24:41.280]   It was not a faith.
[00:24:41.280 --> 00:24:43.720]   It was just something that was passed down to me.
[00:24:43.720 --> 00:24:47.120]   Just like certain phrases, just like certain cultural things.
[00:24:47.120 --> 00:24:50.120]   I just was raised in a Christian home.
[00:24:50.120 --> 00:24:55.240]   The danger of being a Christian for a long time, or raised in a Christian home, and again,
[00:24:55.240 --> 00:24:56.240]   don't get me wrong.
[00:24:56.240 --> 00:24:58.520]   I have nothing against being raised in a Christian home.
[00:24:58.520 --> 00:25:03.480]   I'm not saying practice paganism at home for the sake of your children.
[00:25:03.480 --> 00:25:08.520]   I think rightfully we should do our best to preach the gospel to our children and be a
[00:25:08.520 --> 00:25:11.280]   good example to them.
[00:25:11.280 --> 00:25:18.360]   But the danger, the flip side of that, if we're not careful, we can inoculate our children
[00:25:18.360 --> 00:25:21.680]   to the things that ought to be so precious.
[00:25:21.680 --> 00:25:25.360]   And it's not simply their fault.
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:31.160]   And the reason why inoculation happens is because we become inoculated.
[00:25:31.160 --> 00:25:33.800]   We know how to regurgitate the truth.
[00:25:33.800 --> 00:25:39.000]   We know how to copy what is right without ever having genuine faith.
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:40.040]   We know how to come to church.
[00:25:40.040 --> 00:25:42.360]   We know how to teach the importance of not missing church.
[00:25:42.360 --> 00:25:47.880]   We can do all of that and have nothing to do with genuine worship.
[00:25:47.880 --> 00:25:52.800]   And it numbs our hearts, it numbs our churches, and it causes our children to regurgitate
[00:25:52.800 --> 00:26:00.800]   what we are doing, yet never having genuine faith and never being truly transformed.
[00:26:00.800 --> 00:26:03.720]   That's the danger of being in the same place for a long period of time.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:09.960]   And then typically we think, once that happens, we think, "Oh, it must be the other people.
[00:26:09.960 --> 00:26:11.640]   It must be my environment."
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:15.480]   And so we change churches, change groups, change friends, thinking that maybe it's
[00:26:15.480 --> 00:26:18.320]   their fault.
[00:26:18.320 --> 00:26:21.380]   The danger has always existed.
[00:26:21.380 --> 00:26:25.360]   And that's why if you study the Old Testament or the New Testament, the word "remember"
[00:26:25.360 --> 00:26:28.360]   constantly keeps coming up.
[00:26:28.360 --> 00:26:33.160]   When we are rebuked in the book of Revelation of being lukewarm, he doesn't say, "Go look
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:34.160]   for a new method."
[00:26:34.160 --> 00:26:35.920]   He says, "Remember the height from which you had fallen."
[00:26:35.920 --> 00:26:40.560]   In other words, remember what you have.
[00:26:40.560 --> 00:26:42.280]   Remember why you became a Christian.
[00:26:42.280 --> 00:26:48.680]   Remember your desperateness before Christ, before you became numb to all these things.
[00:26:48.680 --> 00:26:52.480]   One of the most scariest passages in the Bible, in the gospel of John chapter 8.
[00:26:52.480 --> 00:26:56.320]   In fact, if you can do me a favor, turn your Bible to John chapter 8.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:27:04.760]   This is a passage that I've been to many times, but again, I think it helps us to see.
[00:27:04.760 --> 00:27:07.520]   John chapter 8, verse 31.
[00:27:07.520 --> 00:27:10.760]   This is after Jesus' public teaching.
[00:27:10.760 --> 00:27:14.320]   In verse 31, it says, "So Jesus said to the Jews who had believed in him."
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:15.720]   So I want to stop right there.
[00:27:15.720 --> 00:27:18.000]   Who is he talking to?
[00:27:18.000 --> 00:27:21.440]   He's talking to this verse, Jews who profess to believe.
[00:27:21.440 --> 00:27:22.440]   They believe what he was saying.
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:23.680]   Oh, he must be the Messiah.
[00:27:23.680 --> 00:27:25.680]   He's speaking with authority.
[00:27:25.680 --> 00:27:27.200]   So they were following him.
[00:27:27.200 --> 00:27:31.920]   But the conversation he has, Jesus says, "If you abide in my word, you are truly my disciples,
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.760]   and you will know the truth, and the truth will set you free."
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:38.880]   We know that passage very well, and we quote it all the time.
[00:27:38.880 --> 00:27:41.120]   In fact, even the non-Christians quote this passage.
[00:27:41.120 --> 00:27:44.320]   That's how popular this passage is.
[00:27:44.320 --> 00:27:48.360]   When the Jews hear this, they're offended.
[00:27:48.360 --> 00:27:52.600]   They're offended because Jesus basically said, "You need to be set free."
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.800]   We're children of Abraham.
[00:27:54.800 --> 00:27:57.120]   We're Jews.
[00:27:57.120 --> 00:27:58.200]   We were given the promise.
[00:27:58.200 --> 00:27:59.900]   We have the covenant.
[00:27:59.900 --> 00:28:01.400]   We have the patriarch.
[00:28:01.400 --> 00:28:05.920]   How can you possibly say, "We need to be set free," like a common criminal or a common
[00:28:05.920 --> 00:28:06.920]   slave?
[00:28:06.920 --> 00:28:09.160]   Do you know who we are?
[00:28:09.160 --> 00:28:10.160]   We're Jews.
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:11.160]   We're Israelites.
[00:28:11.160 --> 00:28:13.560]   And they're so offended, they go back and forth.
[00:28:13.560 --> 00:28:17.640]   And then I want you to go all the way down to verse 39.
[00:28:17.640 --> 00:28:22.560]   And the conclusion of this discussion in verse 39, "They answered him, 'Abraham is our father.'
[00:28:22.560 --> 00:28:27.400]   Jesus said to them, 'If you were Abraham's children, you would be doing what Abraham
[00:28:27.400 --> 00:28:28.680]   did.
[00:28:28.680 --> 00:28:32.640]   But now you seek to kill me, a man who has told you the truth that I heard from God.
[00:28:32.640 --> 00:28:34.400]   This is not what Abraham did.
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:36.520]   You are doing what your father did.'
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:39.180]   They said to him, 'We were not born of sexual immorality.
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:41.380]   We have one father, even God.'
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:45.800]   Jesus said to them, 'If God were your father, you would love me, for I came from God and
[00:28:45.800 --> 00:28:46.800]   I am here.
[00:28:46.800 --> 00:28:50.720]   I came not of my own accord, but he sent me.
[00:28:50.720 --> 00:28:52.080]   Why do you not understand what I say?
[00:28:52.080 --> 00:28:54.880]   It is because you cannot bear to hear my word.'"
[00:28:54.880 --> 00:28:57.160]   And listen to the conclusion in verse 44.
[00:28:57.160 --> 00:28:59.020]   Who is he talking to?
[00:28:59.020 --> 00:29:01.800]   Verse 31, "People who believe."
[00:29:01.800 --> 00:29:03.680]   That's what it says in verse 31.
[00:29:03.680 --> 00:29:09.200]   But in verse 44, "You are of your father, the devil, and your will is to do your father's
[00:29:09.200 --> 00:29:10.200]   desires."
[00:29:10.200 --> 00:29:13.600]   He is a murderer from the beginning and has nothing to do with the truth because there
[00:29:13.600 --> 00:29:14.820]   is no truth in him.
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:21.900]   When he lies, he speaks out of his own character, for he's a liar and the father of lies.
[00:29:21.900 --> 00:29:26.960]   He was talking to a group of people who were saying they believed him.
[00:29:26.960 --> 00:29:31.720]   And the end result of this discussion was, he says, "God is not your father.
[00:29:31.720 --> 00:29:33.040]   Your father is the devil."
[00:29:33.040 --> 00:29:35.980]   What happened?
[00:29:35.980 --> 00:29:38.120]   Did they fall somewhere in this discussion?
[00:29:38.120 --> 00:29:43.440]   Did they start out as a believer and ended as a non-believer somewhere in this discussion?
[00:29:43.440 --> 00:29:49.640]   See, their profession of belief was superficial, just like the thousands of people who followed
[00:29:49.640 --> 00:29:54.920]   Christ up to the hills and ate the miraculous food.
[00:29:54.920 --> 00:29:58.360]   And when Jesus said, "I am the bread of life," they turned away.
[00:29:58.360 --> 00:29:59.840]   This is too difficult.
[00:29:59.840 --> 00:30:01.760]   They didn't have true faith.
[00:30:01.760 --> 00:30:03.400]   And that's what Paul means to them.
[00:30:03.400 --> 00:30:05.480]   God did not change his mind.
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:07.800]   God did not fail in his promises.
[00:30:07.800 --> 00:30:13.280]   But not all Israelites are Israelites.
[00:30:13.280 --> 00:30:16.520]   True Israelites are the ones who have true faith.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:17.600]   That's what Paul is trying to say.
[00:30:17.600 --> 00:30:19.720]   And he illustrates it with two points.
[00:30:19.720 --> 00:30:25.120]   The earliest part of Israel's history, you have this example of Isaac and Ishmael.
[00:30:25.120 --> 00:30:29.440]   So if you read starting from the second part of verse 7, it says, "Through Isaac shall
[00:30:29.440 --> 00:30:31.680]   your offspring be named."
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:34.920]   This means that it is not the children of the flesh who are the children of God.
[00:30:34.920 --> 00:30:40.240]   So when he's talking about children of the flesh, if you know the story of Isaac, Abraham
[00:30:40.240 --> 00:30:45.040]   is promised that he's going to be the father of multitudes.
[00:30:45.040 --> 00:30:49.440]   So he comes, packs up his bags with his family, he enters out into the desert.
[00:30:49.440 --> 00:30:52.040]   Years pass by, nothing happens.
[00:30:52.040 --> 00:30:56.280]   Sarah is unable to have a child and she's getting old, so she decides that she's going
[00:30:56.280 --> 00:30:59.120]   to take it into her own hands.
[00:30:59.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   So at that particular time in history, the wife could have taken the maidservant because
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:08.300]   she is not able to have a child.
[00:31:08.300 --> 00:31:14.740]   So legally, she can have her slave maidservant have the child with her husband.
[00:31:14.740 --> 00:31:21.000]   And when that child comes, if she receives the child, that child will be considered the
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:23.460]   rightful heir.
[00:31:23.460 --> 00:31:25.040]   And so that was Sarah's intention.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:30.640]   Since I can't have a child of my own, I'll have Abraham sleep with my servant, Hagar,
[00:31:30.640 --> 00:31:34.040]   and then when she has a child, that will become my own.
[00:31:34.040 --> 00:31:37.440]   And this is how we're going to fulfill God's promise.
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:39.760]   So they have a child, Ishmael, of the flesh.
[00:31:39.760 --> 00:31:46.160]   So he has every legal right to be the heir, rightful heir of the promise of Abraham.
[00:31:46.160 --> 00:31:47.640]   Well God has different plans.
[00:31:47.640 --> 00:31:52.620]   He says, "This promise that I made, this covenant that I made with you is not going to be carried
[00:31:52.620 --> 00:31:54.960]   up by your flesh.
[00:31:54.960 --> 00:31:56.240]   It's going to be by my promise."
[00:31:56.240 --> 00:32:01.600]   So at a later age, more than 15 years later, when they're even older, God gives them a
[00:32:01.600 --> 00:32:06.480]   child, Isaac, and his name means laughter because it was unbelievable what God did.
[00:32:06.480 --> 00:32:11.280]   And so that's what Abraham is saying, that from the very get-go, that God's promise was
[00:32:11.280 --> 00:32:16.060]   not dependent upon the flesh, but his promise.
[00:32:16.060 --> 00:32:18.120]   God is the one who is sovereign over salvation.
[00:32:18.120 --> 00:32:20.040]   That was his point.
[00:32:20.040 --> 00:32:21.440]   Now he gives a second illustration.
[00:32:21.440 --> 00:32:25.400]   The reason why he gives a second illustration, some of you guys may have already been thinking,
[00:32:25.400 --> 00:32:30.920]   well maybe Ishmael was disqualified because he wasn't the original mother.
[00:32:30.920 --> 00:32:33.680]   She wasn't a Jew, she was an Egyptian.
[00:32:33.680 --> 00:32:36.560]   Well in order to answer that question, he goes to the second illustration, the next
[00:32:36.560 --> 00:32:39.360]   generation of Jacob and Esau.
[00:32:39.360 --> 00:32:42.640]   They have the same mom, right?
[00:32:42.640 --> 00:32:45.260]   So I want to read this.
[00:32:45.260 --> 00:32:49.280]   So now you can't disqualify it because they have different moms.
[00:32:49.280 --> 00:32:54.480]   They have the same mom, and you have these twins that are born, Jacob and Esau, and this
[00:32:54.480 --> 00:32:57.760]   is what it says, verse 11, 12, and 13.
[00:32:57.760 --> 00:33:02.400]   Though they were not yet born and had done nothing, either good or bad, in order that
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:08.600]   God's purpose of election might continue, not because of works, but because of his call.
[00:33:08.600 --> 00:33:11.440]   That God sovereignly chose Jacob.
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:18.080]   Esau, by his flesh, should have been the rightful heir of God's promise.
[00:33:18.080 --> 00:33:22.680]   But in order to demonstrate that it's not by the flesh, but by God's promise, he deliberately
[00:33:22.680 --> 00:33:26.960]   chooses the second child, just like he chose Isaac.
[00:33:26.960 --> 00:33:33.040]   So from the very beginning of Israel's history, God embedded into their history that it was
[00:33:33.040 --> 00:33:38.520]   not going to be by your flesh, but by his promise, by faith.
[00:33:38.520 --> 00:33:42.320]   And he was illustrating this, that this is nothing new, that God actually had this from
[00:33:42.320 --> 00:33:43.320]   the very beginning.
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:49.000]   And then he goes further, the older will serve the younger, and then he comes to this conclusion,
[00:33:49.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   verse 13, "Jacob I love, but Esau I hate."
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:55.640]   I know a lot of people wrestle with this, right?
[00:33:55.640 --> 00:33:59.280]   I can understand God loving Jacob, but Esau, he hated?
[00:33:59.280 --> 00:34:00.960]   What does that mean?
[00:34:00.960 --> 00:34:05.400]   Again, let's understand that within the context of the scripture and how the word hate is
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:06.680]   often used.
[00:34:06.680 --> 00:34:12.160]   I think the best illustration is found in Luke chapter 14, 26, when Jesus says, "Whoever
[00:34:12.160 --> 00:34:18.120]   comes to me and does not hate his father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters,
[00:34:18.120 --> 00:34:22.320]   yet and even life itself cannot be my disciple."
[00:34:22.320 --> 00:34:30.160]   I think all of us are sophisticated to know that Jesus is not saying, "Go hate your mom."
[00:34:30.160 --> 00:34:34.720]   Don't go home today and say, "You know the church that I went to today, this Baptist
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:38.720]   church, they told me, Jesus said, 'I need to hate you.
[00:34:38.720 --> 00:34:41.720]   I hate you because I love Jesus.'"
[00:34:41.720 --> 00:34:42.720]   Go to your children.
[00:34:42.720 --> 00:34:46.120]   "I hate you because I love Jesus."
[00:34:46.120 --> 00:34:52.240]   Jesus himself said, "To honor your father and mother."
[00:34:52.240 --> 00:34:54.480]   Is that what Jesus means when he says that?
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:34:58.080]   You have to understand again, in the context of what Paul is saying, in the context of
[00:34:58.080 --> 00:35:05.800]   what Jesus is saying, he's saying that God's sovereign choice, God's sovereign choice of
[00:35:05.800 --> 00:35:13.520]   Jacob over Esau, demonstrates that the author of life is God and God alone.
[00:35:13.520 --> 00:35:18.920]   Now, what does that mean to us as Christians?
[00:35:18.920 --> 00:35:25.240]   One, our flesh doesn't play a part in our salvation.
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:30.680]   Our flesh, our heritage, your past experiences, past works, whatever it is that you bring
[00:35:30.680 --> 00:35:34.120]   to the table has nothing to do with our salvation.
[00:35:34.120 --> 00:35:38.520]   God did not sovereignly choose us because he saw something precious in us and he needed
[00:35:38.520 --> 00:35:41.600]   us.
[00:35:41.600 --> 00:35:46.800]   That's not how salvation is initiated or continued or finished.
[00:35:46.800 --> 00:35:50.080]   It is not of the flesh but of faith.
[00:35:50.080 --> 00:35:56.000]   The reason why they had Isaac is because God was trying to demonstrate that he's going
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:36:03.680]   to keep his promise so that Abraham and Isaac would understand that the promise wasn't because,
[00:36:03.680 --> 00:36:05.920]   wow, thank God we have Isaac now.
[00:36:05.920 --> 00:36:08.120]   Isaac is our hope.
[00:36:08.120 --> 00:36:12.800]   Just in case that Abraham might have forgotten what he did at the end of Abraham's life,
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:14.720]   what does he say to Abraham?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:16.200]   "You gave up your son Isaac."
[00:36:16.200 --> 00:36:19.240]   I mean, think about it.
[00:36:19.240 --> 00:36:23.880]   From Abraham's point of view, I mean, you took us through this once already.
[00:36:23.880 --> 00:36:27.760]   We weren't able to have children and you miraculously gave us Isaac and now we have a hope and then
[00:36:27.760 --> 00:36:32.640]   now we've invested all of this time, energy, and money on this child thinking now the road
[00:36:32.640 --> 00:36:37.280]   seems clear and all of a sudden he comes out, boom, and he blocks the road.
[00:36:37.280 --> 00:36:39.720]   "Give me your child."
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   Why does he do that?
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:48.880]   Because he's trying to teach again to Abraham and to all of us, the father of faith.
[00:36:48.880 --> 00:36:53.720]   Salvation is not of the flesh but of faith.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:55.720]   Isaac was not their hope.
[00:36:55.720 --> 00:36:58.440]   God was.
[00:36:58.440 --> 00:36:59.800]   Church is not our hope.
[00:36:59.800 --> 00:37:00.800]   God is.
[00:37:00.800 --> 00:37:05.800]   But people, circumstance, their experiences, whatever it is that we bring to the table
[00:37:05.800 --> 00:37:09.360]   oftentimes ends up becoming a hindrance.
[00:37:09.360 --> 00:37:14.480]   First and foremost, the same lesson that Paul is trying to tell the nation of Israel is
[00:37:14.480 --> 00:37:17.880]   so crucial to every single one of us.
[00:37:17.880 --> 00:37:25.640]   The moment any kind of pride enters into our hearts in coming to the communion table, into
[00:37:25.640 --> 00:37:30.720]   the fellowship, into our pursuit of Christ, that very thing that you think is causing
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:36.280]   you to draw closer to God causes you to have the greatest hindrance.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:42.760]   Every single one of us, every time we come to God, comes as spiritual beggars.
[00:37:42.760 --> 00:37:45.040]   That's the point that Paul was trying to make.
[00:37:45.040 --> 00:37:49.780]   The second lesson is mentioned in Hebrews 6.17.
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:54.080]   So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable
[00:37:54.080 --> 00:37:59.360]   character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath, so that by two unchangeable
[00:37:59.360 --> 00:38:04.480]   things in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have
[00:38:04.480 --> 00:38:09.800]   strong encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:12.560]   That even when we are faithless, he is faithful.
[00:38:12.560 --> 00:38:15.680]   God does not change.
[00:38:15.680 --> 00:38:21.720]   So our hope that we have in Christ is absolutely immutable.
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:24.040]   Does not change.
[00:38:24.040 --> 00:38:28.280]   But the same faith that we started with is the same faith that causes us to persevere
[00:38:28.280 --> 00:38:32.160]   and is the same faith that will cause us to finish.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:38.920]   And that's why at the end of Hebrews chapter 12 it says, fix your eyes upon Christ.
[00:38:38.920 --> 00:38:43.280]   He's the author, he's the perfecter of our faith.
[00:38:43.280 --> 00:38:47.400]   That he who began a good work in you, he will carry it on to completion until the day of
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:49.140]   Christ.
[00:38:49.140 --> 00:38:56.220]   So the application in the context, Paul may be trying to explain the gospel to the Jews.
[00:38:56.220 --> 00:39:00.380]   The application is so important for every single one of us.
[00:39:00.380 --> 00:39:06.780]   Until we are humble and desperate before God, you will never fully appreciate and understand.
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:11.100]   And your heart will become numb and inoculated.
[00:39:11.100 --> 00:39:15.540]   We can sing the gospel, we can tell the gospel, we can repeat the gospel, we can recite the
[00:39:15.540 --> 00:39:22.660]   gospel, memorize the gospel, and yet does nothing to your heart.
[00:39:22.660 --> 00:39:25.380]   Because we are not desperate.
[00:39:25.380 --> 00:39:27.180]   Every single one of us.
[00:39:27.180 --> 00:39:33.780]   Myself, and every elder, every deacon, every servant, every small group leader, every Sunday
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.100]   school teacher, every single one of us.
[00:39:37.100 --> 00:39:39.500]   We are desperate before God.
[00:39:39.500 --> 00:39:43.260]   That's what this communion table is ultimately about.
[00:39:43.260 --> 00:39:47.580]   Some of you guys may think twice about coming to the communion table because you struggle
[00:39:47.580 --> 00:39:49.900]   with the purity this week.
[00:39:49.900 --> 00:39:51.860]   I don't deserve to come up.
[00:39:51.860 --> 00:39:55.300]   Maybe next time when I feel better, maybe when I did a better job as a Christian, maybe
[00:39:55.300 --> 00:39:57.500]   I'll come up.
[00:39:57.500 --> 00:40:00.860]   Here's the other side of God's faithfulness.
[00:40:00.860 --> 00:40:05.700]   He promised that if you confess your faith, confess your sins, he is faithful and just
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:08.100]   to forgive you of all your unrighteousness.
[00:40:08.100 --> 00:40:12.900]   The only requirement is to confess and repent.
[00:40:12.900 --> 00:40:15.900]   Through repentance and receive forgiveness.
[00:40:15.900 --> 00:40:21.220]   So I ask all of you, as you guys are contemplating and taking some time to pray, if you have
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:24.820]   unconfessed sins, take some time to pray and genuinely confess.
[00:40:24.820 --> 00:40:28.840]   Not superficially, just, "Oh, forgive me," and then just come on.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:33.440]   Really come before the Lord in genuine repentance and renewal.
[00:40:33.440 --> 00:40:41.020]   And if Satan puts thoughts in your head, "You are undeserving," how can you possibly come
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:45.580]   up to the table again after your failure?
[00:40:45.580 --> 00:40:51.060]   Remind whatever is coming into your head that it was never of your flesh to begin with.
[00:40:51.060 --> 00:40:54.460]   It was never of your flesh to begin with.
[00:40:54.460 --> 00:40:59.380]   The only requirement that God makes is to pray and ask for forgiveness.
[00:40:59.380 --> 00:41:03.900]   So I pray that as we open up the communion table, that one by one, as you are ready to
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:10.680]   come up and let me, since this is a new place, we're going to have to give you some instruction.
[00:41:10.680 --> 00:41:15.720]   So what I'm going to ask is everybody, you guys choose from this side, this way.
[00:41:15.720 --> 00:41:20.820]   So if you're coming from this side, grab the elements and then go back out down this aisle.
[00:41:20.820 --> 00:41:21.820]   Okay?
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:22.820]   And same thing with you guys.
[00:41:22.820 --> 00:41:23.820]   You guys come this way, go back out this aisle.
[00:41:23.820 --> 00:41:26.860]   If you start crisscrossing here, it's going to cause chaos.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.780]   So again, if you're coming this way, grab your stuff and go back out that way.
[00:41:29.780 --> 00:41:30.780]   Same thing with this.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:35.220]   And again, I ask when we open up the communion table, communion table is meant for baptized
[00:41:35.220 --> 00:41:36.220]   Christians.
[00:41:36.220 --> 00:41:40.800]   And if you are a confessing believer and your sins have been forgiven, then again, we ask
[00:41:40.800 --> 00:41:41.800]   you to come.
[00:41:41.800 --> 00:41:44.760]   This is to commemorate and to celebrate what Christ has done.
[00:41:44.760 --> 00:41:48.920]   If you have never confessed Christ and never been forgiven, never been baptized, we ask
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:52.880]   that you would remain in your seat and that you would just be there and just watchful
[00:41:52.880 --> 00:41:53.880]   and prayerful.
[00:41:53.880 --> 00:41:58.240]   But again, let me open up the communion table for us in first Corinthians 11 and then I'm
[00:41:58.240 --> 00:42:01.300]   going to pray and ask the praise team to come up.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:04.200]   And then when you're ready, one by one, please come up and participate.
[00:42:04.200 --> 00:42:10.120]   First Corinthians 11 23, for I received from the Lord what I also delivered to you that
[00:42:10.120 --> 00:42:13.640]   the Lord Jesus on the night when he was betrayed to bread.
[00:42:13.640 --> 00:42:17.000]   And when he had given things, he broke it and said, this is my body, which is for you.
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:19.960]   Do this in remembrance of me in the same way.
[00:42:19.960 --> 00:42:24.520]   Also he took the cup after supper saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:42:24.520 --> 00:42:28.240]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:42:28.240 --> 00:42:32.560]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup, you proclaim the Lord's death until
[00:42:32.560 --> 00:42:34.560]   he comes.
[00:42:34.560 --> 00:42:37.840]   Heavenly father, we thank you.
[00:42:37.840 --> 00:42:42.200]   We thank you for what this communion table represents.
[00:42:42.200 --> 00:42:49.000]   We do this in remembrance of Christ that we may proclaim his love and sacrifice, the blood
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:51.280]   and life that he sacrificed for us.
[00:42:51.280 --> 00:42:57.280]   You knew no sin, but become sin for our sake.
[00:42:57.280 --> 00:43:03.720]   Help us Lord God to revisit our salvation, to rethink and remember Lord God, our desperate
[00:43:03.720 --> 00:43:07.980]   state when we are always far from you.
[00:43:07.980 --> 00:43:12.800]   Help us Lord to be revived and renewed and reconciled.
[00:43:12.800 --> 00:43:14.080]   There's any unconfessed sins.
[00:43:14.080 --> 00:43:17.760]   We pray Lord God that you would bring it to remembrance.
[00:43:17.760 --> 00:43:20.280]   Help us to be reconciled before we come to the table.
[00:43:20.280 --> 00:43:26.120]   We pray that by your grace that we would receive your grace in Jesus name.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:26.480]   Amen.
