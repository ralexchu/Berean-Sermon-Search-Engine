[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.320]   Okay, my glasses here.
[00:00:02.320 --> 00:00:05.160]   Okay, good morning.
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.360]   It's good to see everybody starting the day
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:10.620]   giving God the first fruits of their morning.
[00:00:10.620 --> 00:00:15.040]   I'll be covering the events of Jesus's day on Monday
[00:00:15.040 --> 00:00:18.540]   of the Passion Week, and let us begin by reading
[00:00:18.540 --> 00:00:21.120]   the passage for this morning, which is,
[00:00:21.120 --> 00:00:25.120]   please turn your Bibles to Mark chapter 11,
[00:00:25.120 --> 00:00:27.900]   verse 12 through 19.
[00:00:29.400 --> 00:00:34.160]   I'll give you a little time to find the passage.
[00:00:34.160 --> 00:00:41.160]   Okay, so I'll go ahead and read and just follow along.
[00:00:41.160 --> 00:00:45.800]   On the following day, when they came from Bethany,
[00:00:45.800 --> 00:00:48.520]   he was hungry, and seeing in the distance
[00:00:48.520 --> 00:00:51.420]   a fig tree and leaf, he went to see
[00:00:51.420 --> 00:00:54.060]   if he could find anything on it.
[00:00:54.060 --> 00:00:57.320]   When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves,
[00:00:57.320 --> 00:01:00.080]   for it was not the season for figs.
[00:01:00.080 --> 00:01:03.200]   And he said to it, may no one ever eat fruit
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:06.280]   from you again, and his disciples heard it.
[00:01:06.280 --> 00:01:10.240]   And they came to Jerusalem, and he entered the temple
[00:01:10.240 --> 00:01:12.840]   and began to drive out those who sold
[00:01:12.840 --> 00:01:15.040]   and those who bought in the temple.
[00:01:15.040 --> 00:01:17.960]   And he overturned the tables of the money changers
[00:01:17.960 --> 00:01:20.960]   and the seats of those who were sold pigeons.
[00:01:20.960 --> 00:01:23.720]   And he would not allow anyone to carry anything
[00:01:23.720 --> 00:01:25.360]   through the temple.
[00:01:25.360 --> 00:01:27.900]   And he was teaching them and saying to them,
[00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.000]   is it not written, my house shall be called
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:33.980]   a house of prayer for all the nations?
[00:01:33.980 --> 00:01:36.480]   But you have made it a den of robbers.
[00:01:36.480 --> 00:01:39.040]   And the chief priests and the scribes heard it
[00:01:39.040 --> 00:01:41.560]   and were seeking a way to destroy him.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:44.360]   For they feared him, because all the crowd
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:46.600]   was astonished at his teaching.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:49.820]   And when evening came, they went out of the city.
[00:01:49.820 --> 00:01:52.320]   Let us pray.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.480]   (silence)
[00:01:54.480 --> 00:02:00.840]   Dear Heavenly Father, we thank you Lord for this morning.
[00:02:00.840 --> 00:02:05.220]   We thank you for everyone who is gathered here, Lord God.
[00:02:05.220 --> 00:02:09.340]   We are here this morning because this week
[00:02:09.340 --> 00:02:12.960]   is so important in our own Christian walk, Lord God,
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:17.120]   because what it stands for, that the son of God
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:21.720]   humbled himself, made himself nothing,
[00:02:21.720 --> 00:02:24.480]   and became a servant for our sake.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:27.840]   Lived among us, Lord, so lovingly and sacrificially.
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:33.920]   And eventually died on the cross for our sake.
[00:02:33.920 --> 00:02:38.920]   Those you came for rejected you, and you sacrificed.
[00:02:38.920 --> 00:02:43.160]   Lord, I pray that as we listen to your word
[00:02:43.160 --> 00:02:46.760]   and your passage, Father, your word in the events
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:50.320]   of this week is powerful in themselves, Father.
[00:02:50.320 --> 00:02:53.440]   And I pray that we would put it into proper context
[00:02:53.440 --> 00:02:56.680]   of importance in their lives, and that you would
[00:02:56.680 --> 00:02:59.920]   help us, Lord God, as we start this day
[00:02:59.920 --> 00:03:03.560]   meditating on your word and what you did on Monday.
[00:03:03.560 --> 00:03:05.720]   That you would continue it on through the day,
[00:03:05.720 --> 00:03:08.520]   continue it on throughout the week, Lord,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.280]   so that we can remember what Christ has done.
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:17.200]   We could remember all that we have received in Christ,
[00:03:17.200 --> 00:03:20.760]   and we could rejoice for what we have in Christ,
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:23.000]   with the hope that we have, Lord God.
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:26.120]   We thank you, pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:03:26.120 --> 00:03:32.120]   Okay, so let me set the stage for events of Monday.
[00:03:32.120 --> 00:03:36.640]   It is morning time, Jesus is walking towards Jerusalem
[00:03:36.640 --> 00:03:41.640]   from Bethany, and Bethany was Jesus' base station.
[00:03:42.960 --> 00:03:47.880]   So during this time in Jerusalem, there are,
[00:03:47.880 --> 00:03:50.360]   Pastor Peter mentioned yesterday that over a million
[00:03:50.360 --> 00:03:53.640]   people would come to Jerusalem, so the place
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:58.640]   was very crowded, so even if the Jesus and disciples
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:03.080]   wanted to find housing there, probably there was
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:08.080]   no housing, so they stayed in a nearby city,
[00:04:08.080 --> 00:04:11.360]   Bethany, house of Martha, Mary,
[00:04:11.360 --> 00:04:14.600]   (microphone feedback)
[00:04:14.600 --> 00:04:31.520]   See, okay, so we see what's happening here
[00:04:31.520 --> 00:04:34.560]   is that that morning, so Jesus is walking
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.440]   with his disciples, coming from Bethany,
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:45.360]   all right, okay, is that okay?
[00:04:45.360 --> 00:04:48.080]   All right, so we see Jesus and his disciples
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:52.040]   are coming from Bethany, and Jesus sees a fig tree,
[00:04:52.040 --> 00:04:55.480]   and a strange thing happens, and in Mark's account,
[00:04:55.480 --> 00:04:58.160]   this is what it says, on the following day,
[00:04:58.160 --> 00:05:00.400]   when they came from Bethany, he was hungry,
[00:05:00.400 --> 00:05:04.560]   and seeing in the distance a fig tree and leaf,
[00:05:04.560 --> 00:05:07.680]   he went to see if he could find anything on it.
[00:05:07.680 --> 00:05:10.680]   When he came to it, he found nothing but leaves,
[00:05:10.680 --> 00:05:15.040]   for it was not the season for figs, and he said to it,
[00:05:15.040 --> 00:05:18.400]   may no one ever eat fruit from you again,
[00:05:18.400 --> 00:05:20.280]   and his disciples heard it.
[00:05:20.280 --> 00:05:26.440]   In Matthew 21, 19, it says the fig tree withered at once.
[00:05:26.440 --> 00:05:29.400]   This is a relative term, as far as at once,
[00:05:29.400 --> 00:05:33.040]   the tree may have died at once, but in Mark's account,
[00:05:33.040 --> 00:05:36.800]   11, 14, suggests that the withering and the visible
[00:05:36.800 --> 00:05:40.520]   image of the withering actually happened the next day,
[00:05:40.520 --> 00:05:43.960]   so we see that as they were coming back on Tuesday
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.160]   to Jerusalem, the disciples saw the withered tree.
[00:05:47.160 --> 00:05:51.480]   Often, the Old Testament refers to the nation of Israel
[00:05:51.480 --> 00:05:55.920]   as a fig tree, so we see that Jesus pronounces judgment
[00:05:55.920 --> 00:05:59.760]   upon the fig tree, and says, may no one ever eat fruit
[00:05:59.760 --> 00:06:00.840]   from you again.
[00:06:00.840 --> 00:06:05.380]   The withering of the tree is a foreshadow of the judgment
[00:06:05.380 --> 00:06:08.500]   that is to come upon Israel in AD 70.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:10.520]   We know what happened in AD 70, right?
[00:06:10.520 --> 00:06:15.300]   The Romans came and completely destroyed Israel.
[00:06:15.300 --> 00:06:20.180]   As from time of AD 70, there was no nation of Israel,
[00:06:20.180 --> 00:06:24.980]   and all the genealogy that dates back to who is from
[00:06:24.980 --> 00:06:27.700]   the Levitical tribe, who is from this tribe,
[00:06:27.700 --> 00:06:31.340]   and all that was destroyed, 'cause they completely
[00:06:31.340 --> 00:06:35.320]   destroyed it, they took it away, and they took captive
[00:06:35.320 --> 00:06:38.940]   the Israelites, so we see the pronouncement of the judgment,
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:43.420]   and we see that this judgment that is pronounced,
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:47.100]   Jesus was looking, and it was pronouncing,
[00:06:47.100 --> 00:06:50.820]   this was symbolic of what was gonna happen to Israel,
[00:06:50.820 --> 00:06:53.460]   and we know that as he was doing this,
[00:06:53.460 --> 00:06:56.500]   Jesus' heart was very heavy, and we know that
[00:06:56.500 --> 00:07:00.140]   because in Luke's account in chapter 13, 41 to 44,
[00:07:00.140 --> 00:07:02.940]   and Pastor Peter mentioned it yesterday,
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:06.160]   and I'll read, just follow along,
[00:07:06.160 --> 00:07:08.440]   and when he drew near and saw the city,
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:12.200]   he wept over it, saying, "Would that you, even you,
[00:07:12.200 --> 00:07:16.020]   "had known on this day the things that make for peace,
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.000]   "but now they are hidden from your eyes,
[00:07:19.000 --> 00:07:21.540]   "for the days will come upon you when your enemies
[00:07:21.540 --> 00:07:25.220]   "will set up a barricade around you, and surround you,
[00:07:25.220 --> 00:07:27.700]   "and hem you in on every side,
[00:07:27.700 --> 00:07:29.880]   "and tear you down to the ground.
[00:07:29.880 --> 00:07:32.140]   "You and your children within you,
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:35.220]   "and they will not leave one stone upon another in you,
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.920]   "because you did not know the time of your visitation."
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.320]   And Pastor Peter mentioned how Jesus wept,
[00:07:41.320 --> 00:07:43.880]   and this is not one tear, but rather,
[00:07:43.880 --> 00:07:47.320]   he was weeping inside because he foreshadowed
[00:07:47.320 --> 00:07:48.880]   and knew what was gonna happen.
[00:07:48.880 --> 00:07:53.240]   So Jesus pronounces this curse upon the fig tree,
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.840]   and then from there, Jesus and the disciples
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:07:59.800]   enter the city of Jerusalem, and Jesus enters the temple,
[00:07:59.800 --> 00:08:02.140]   and as he is entering the temple,
[00:08:02.140 --> 00:08:05.720]   his emotions are aroused by what he sees.
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:08.860]   And this is what Mark says, "And they came to Jerusalem,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:11.660]   "and he entered the temple, and began to drive out
[00:08:11.660 --> 00:08:14.880]   "those who sold, and those who bought in the temple,
[00:08:14.880 --> 00:08:17.560]   "and he overturned the tables of the money changers,
[00:08:17.560 --> 00:08:20.200]   "and the seats of those who sold pigeons.
[00:08:20.200 --> 00:08:22.460]   "And he was teaching them, and saying to them,
[00:08:22.460 --> 00:08:25.300]   "Is it not written, my house shall be called
[00:08:25.300 --> 00:08:28.520]   "the house of prayer for all nations,
[00:08:28.520 --> 00:08:31.440]   "but you have made it a den of robbers."
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:35.660]   First, I don't see a man who is out of control with anger.
[00:08:35.660 --> 00:08:39.100]   I don't see Jesus losing control of himself
[00:08:39.100 --> 00:08:41.580]   and going around and doing all this,
[00:08:41.580 --> 00:08:44.300]   but rather, I see a zealous person,
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:47.480]   but I also see one who's perfectly in control
[00:08:47.480 --> 00:08:50.560]   of the situation and is intentionally,
[00:08:50.560 --> 00:08:52.700]   intentional in what he's doing.
[00:08:52.700 --> 00:08:56.260]   This passage says that he tells us
[00:08:56.260 --> 00:08:59.920]   that Jesus was teaching them and quoting scripture.
[00:08:59.920 --> 00:09:02.100]   He was doing this, but he was teaching them,
[00:09:02.100 --> 00:09:04.000]   and he was quoting scripture.
[00:09:04.000 --> 00:09:07.200]   So I believe Jesus was trying to open up their eyes
[00:09:07.200 --> 00:09:09.220]   to see what the temple had become.
[00:09:09.220 --> 00:09:13.940]   It should have been a house of prayer for all nations,
[00:09:13.940 --> 00:09:16.280]   but it had become a den of robbers.
[00:09:16.280 --> 00:09:20.160]   The temple was to be a place where nations
[00:09:20.160 --> 00:09:23.860]   were to come pray, Jews and Gentiles,
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:25.400]   and God's plan from the beginning
[00:09:25.400 --> 00:09:27.400]   was to save all nations.
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:31.560]   In Genesis 12, God makes a promise to Abraham,
[00:09:31.560 --> 00:09:34.160]   and that promise says, "I will bless you.
[00:09:34.160 --> 00:09:35.840]   "I will make you into a great nation,
[00:09:35.840 --> 00:09:38.840]   "and I'm gonna bless all nations through you."
[00:09:38.840 --> 00:09:43.340]   Other passages in the Old Testament reiterate this,
[00:09:43.340 --> 00:09:45.480]   that God was going to bless all nations
[00:09:45.480 --> 00:09:47.060]   to the seed of Abraham.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.840]   However, it had become a place of exclusion
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.060]   and not what it was intended to be.
[00:09:54.060 --> 00:09:57.880]   So what was happening is you have the court of Gentiles,
[00:09:57.880 --> 00:09:59.920]   and that's where all the money changers,
[00:09:59.920 --> 00:10:03.120]   and they were doing all the transaction.
[00:10:03.120 --> 00:10:05.520]   See, so the only place in the temple
[00:10:05.520 --> 00:10:09.600]   where the Gentiles could come and pray and worship God
[00:10:09.600 --> 00:10:11.680]   was the court of Gentiles.
[00:10:11.680 --> 00:10:15.560]   So by doing this, that they were frustrating
[00:10:15.560 --> 00:10:18.220]   the worship of the Gentiles.
[00:10:18.220 --> 00:10:20.840]   The priest would not accept.
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:22.400]   So what was going on is that the priest
[00:10:22.400 --> 00:10:25.080]   would not accept the sacrifices.
[00:10:25.080 --> 00:10:29.140]   So if you brought the sacrifice from outside of the temple
[00:10:29.140 --> 00:10:31.740]   and not buy it from the court of temple,
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:34.940]   what was going on, then the priest would not accept it.
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:37.620]   So you could kind of see what would happen.
[00:10:37.620 --> 00:10:39.180]   Then if the priest don't accept it,
[00:10:39.180 --> 00:10:42.620]   then these exchangers and purchasers,
[00:10:42.620 --> 00:10:44.500]   they're gonna be jacking up the price
[00:10:44.500 --> 00:10:47.420]   because that's the only place that you could buy a sacrifice
[00:10:47.420 --> 00:10:49.620]   to give to the priest that is acceptable.
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:54.140]   So Jesus says that they had turned the temple
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:10:56.980]   into den of robbers, that instead of a place
[00:10:56.980 --> 00:10:58.800]   that people could come and worship,
[00:10:58.800 --> 00:11:00.960]   now they have turned it into a place
[00:11:00.960 --> 00:11:03.540]   of business, of robbing people.
[00:11:03.540 --> 00:11:07.500]   I believe the state of the temple was indicative
[00:11:07.500 --> 00:11:10.320]   of what was happening to the nation of Israel.
[00:11:10.320 --> 00:11:13.860]   They had lost their way and have gone so far from God
[00:11:13.860 --> 00:11:15.900]   that they made the temple not a place
[00:11:15.900 --> 00:11:17.960]   where all nations could gather,
[00:11:17.960 --> 00:11:22.000]   but instead it was a place people stayed away from,
[00:11:22.000 --> 00:11:24.040]   at least if they wanted to find God.
[00:11:24.040 --> 00:11:28.520]   One thing that I've been thinking about
[00:11:28.520 --> 00:11:31.620]   and meditating on for a while,
[00:11:31.620 --> 00:11:34.280]   and a big question mark in my head is,
[00:11:34.280 --> 00:11:39.000]   when the gospels begin telling the gospel story,
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:42.640]   it opens up with all the people,
[00:11:42.640 --> 00:11:45.200]   Jerusalem and Judea, going out to the wilderness
[00:11:45.200 --> 00:11:49.940]   to seek John, John the Baptist.
[00:11:49.940 --> 00:11:52.400]   And this was, they're going out
[00:11:52.400 --> 00:11:55.800]   and they're seeking a baptism of repentance.
[00:11:55.800 --> 00:11:59.480]   So this is what, I'll read from Mark 1, 4 to 5 about this.
[00:11:59.480 --> 00:12:02.120]   So John appeared baptizing in the wilderness
[00:12:02.120 --> 00:12:04.920]   and proclaiming a baptism of repentance
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:06.640]   for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:12:06.640 --> 00:12:09.040]   And all the country of Judea and all Jerusalem
[00:12:09.040 --> 00:12:11.960]   were going out to him, were being baptized
[00:12:11.960 --> 00:12:15.280]   by him in the river Jordan, confessing their sins.
[00:12:15.280 --> 00:12:20.280]   So we have a picture of them going out
[00:12:20.280 --> 00:12:23.720]   to John the Baptist for the sake of repenting.
[00:12:23.720 --> 00:12:27.000]   So I was thinking to myself, for the Jews,
[00:12:27.000 --> 00:12:28.760]   where are you supposed to go?
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:33.080]   Where are you supposed to go to find atonement
[00:12:33.080 --> 00:12:34.520]   for sacrifice for your sins?
[00:12:34.520 --> 00:12:38.160]   If you ask for forgiveness, where are you supposed to go?
[00:12:38.160 --> 00:12:41.360]   I'm thinking they're supposed to go to the temple,
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.720]   but instead of going to the temple,
[00:12:43.720 --> 00:12:47.960]   you see them in droves going out to John the Baptist
[00:12:47.960 --> 00:12:49.280]   in the wilderness.
[00:12:49.280 --> 00:12:53.960]   Why would they go there when you have a nice temple,
[00:12:53.960 --> 00:12:56.320]   great temple, temple of, you know, Herod's Temple,
[00:12:56.320 --> 00:12:58.580]   which is beautiful, great, big,
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:01.280]   but instead they choose to go out to the wilderness.
[00:13:01.280 --> 00:13:04.960]   And I don't know about you, when I think about wilderness,
[00:13:04.960 --> 00:13:07.520]   one of the imagery I have is the wilderness
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:12.520]   of the nation of Israel when they were wandering
[00:13:12.520 --> 00:13:15.360]   in the desert in the wilderness for 40 years.
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.880]   Another imagery that is spoken of in the wilderness,
[00:13:19.880 --> 00:13:22.720]   it talks about in the day of atonement, right?
[00:13:22.720 --> 00:13:26.320]   The high priest would make sacrifice of a bull
[00:13:26.320 --> 00:13:31.320]   for his own sin, put the blood on the mercy seat
[00:13:31.320 --> 00:13:34.920]   and cleanses it, and then they have two goats.
[00:13:34.920 --> 00:13:39.920]   And of the two goats, they would go ahead and do lots
[00:13:39.920 --> 00:13:43.280]   to decide which one is gonna be sacrificed
[00:13:43.280 --> 00:13:46.360]   and which one will be the goat that is sent out,
[00:13:46.360 --> 00:13:49.800]   representative of the imputed sin of Israel
[00:13:49.800 --> 00:13:51.880]   and sent out into the wilderness.
[00:13:51.880 --> 00:13:55.040]   So the imagery there is in the wilderness,
[00:13:55.040 --> 00:13:58.080]   they are sending this goat, ceremonial goat,
[00:13:58.080 --> 00:14:01.240]   where the sins of Israel is placed on this goat
[00:14:01.240 --> 00:14:02.880]   and sent out to the wilderness.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.040]   So wilderness is not an imagery of,
[00:14:07.040 --> 00:14:09.480]   oh, it's a great place to go.
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:12.120]   But instead, we still see them going in droves
[00:14:12.120 --> 00:14:15.400]   to John the Baptist instead of going to the temple.
[00:14:15.400 --> 00:14:18.800]   So you see that there was something not right.
[00:14:18.800 --> 00:14:21.480]   So this is an odd scene.
[00:14:21.480 --> 00:14:23.200]   Where were the Jews supposed to go
[00:14:23.200 --> 00:14:26.040]   if they wanted forgiveness of sins?
[00:14:26.040 --> 00:14:27.760]   Was it not the temple?
[00:14:27.760 --> 00:14:30.720]   Instead of the temple, they were going out to the desert,
[00:14:30.720 --> 00:14:32.880]   seeking John the Baptist in the wilderness.
[00:14:33.720 --> 00:14:38.440]   So we see a sick temple, a temple that lost its purpose.
[00:14:38.440 --> 00:14:44.400]   So this morning, as we consider and meditate
[00:14:44.400 --> 00:14:47.920]   on what happened this morning, what happened on Monday,
[00:14:47.920 --> 00:14:50.440]   so what is our takeaway from this passage?
[00:14:50.440 --> 00:14:54.200]   We see, first, we see the cursing of the fig tree,
[00:14:54.200 --> 00:14:56.240]   which is symbolic of the judgment
[00:14:56.240 --> 00:14:58.320]   that is coming upon Israel.
[00:14:58.320 --> 00:15:01.440]   Then we see the temple that was to be a place of prayer
[00:15:01.440 --> 00:15:05.920]   for all nations, but it become a corrupt marketplace.
[00:15:05.920 --> 00:15:09.160]   So we further see the people not going to the temple,
[00:15:09.160 --> 00:15:13.280]   but away from it into wilderness to find forgiveness.
[00:15:13.280 --> 00:15:16.560]   The nation of Israel had become so much like the world
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.920]   that there was no distinction such that it became no more.
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:24.600]   So the purpose of the nation of Israel was to glorify God.
[00:15:24.600 --> 00:15:28.120]   The purpose of the temple was to house the presence of God.
[00:15:28.120 --> 00:15:30.720]   But we see both the temple and the nation of Israel
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:34.640]   no longer became distinct.
[00:15:34.640 --> 00:15:36.800]   Instead, they became like the world.
[00:15:36.800 --> 00:15:38.900]   So therefore, there was no purpose for it.
[00:15:38.900 --> 00:15:42.280]   So the takeaway as I finish this,
[00:15:42.280 --> 00:15:46.560]   let's all turn to Hebrews chapter 13, verse 12 to 14,
[00:15:46.560 --> 00:15:49.000]   and then I will end with this.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.960]   And the challenge to us this morning,
[00:15:50.960 --> 00:15:55.960]   as we have read this passage
[00:15:55.960 --> 00:16:00.680]   and meditating on what Jesus did on Monday,
[00:16:00.680 --> 00:16:04.320]   and Hebrews chapter 13, 12 to 14 says,
[00:16:04.320 --> 00:16:07.480]   so Jesus also suffered outside the gate
[00:16:07.480 --> 00:16:11.720]   in order to sanctify the people through his own blood.
[00:16:11.720 --> 00:16:15.840]   Therefore, let us go to him outside the camp
[00:16:15.840 --> 00:16:18.440]   and bear the reproach he endured.
[00:16:18.440 --> 00:16:21.460]   For here we have no lasting city,
[00:16:21.460 --> 00:16:24.320]   but we seek the city that is to come.
[00:16:24.320 --> 00:16:28.960]   This morning, let us examine our heart and our lives.
[00:16:28.960 --> 00:16:32.280]   Are we willing to go outside the camp,
[00:16:32.280 --> 00:16:36.920]   outside our comfort zone, and go to him outside the camp?
[00:16:36.920 --> 00:16:39.600]   So we see in this Hebrews passage,
[00:16:39.600 --> 00:16:42.440]   in Hebrews it's all about the supremacy of Christ.
[00:16:42.440 --> 00:16:44.760]   Christ is greater than the angels.
[00:16:44.760 --> 00:16:49.260]   He is greater than the Old Testament sacrificial system.
[00:16:49.260 --> 00:16:51.240]   He is greater than the high priest.
[00:16:51.240 --> 00:16:56.000]   He is greater than all things, the supremacy of Christ.
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:17:00.560]   And in chapter 13, the Hebrew writer is challenging us,
[00:17:00.560 --> 00:17:03.480]   just like the people were going in droves
[00:17:03.480 --> 00:17:06.760]   to the wilderness to seek repentance in John the Baptist.
[00:17:06.760 --> 00:17:08.520]   Hebrew writer is telling us,
[00:17:08.520 --> 00:17:11.640]   look, Jesus was crucified outside the camp,
[00:17:11.640 --> 00:17:15.400]   outside the city, and he was crucified there.
[00:17:15.400 --> 00:17:19.600]   And then he says, go to him where he is.
[00:17:19.600 --> 00:17:22.360]   Go to him outside the camp
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:25.020]   and bear the reproach he endured.
[00:17:25.020 --> 00:17:28.880]   So the call to that is for us to go to a place
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:33.880]   that is not comfortable, that has persecution,
[00:17:33.880 --> 00:17:37.080]   'cause Jesus was crucified outside the camp.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:40.520]   So as we meditate this week, I mean, this week,
[00:17:40.520 --> 00:17:45.160]   people just talk, I mean, it's just in the air about Easter.
[00:17:45.160 --> 00:17:49.360]   You're gonna hear Easter eggs, Easter Jesus.
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:52.360]   These things are gonna be mentioned,
[00:17:52.360 --> 00:17:54.320]   and there are gonna be people very open
[00:17:54.320 --> 00:17:56.100]   to at least the discussion.
[00:17:56.100 --> 00:18:00.940]   So it is uncomfortable sometimes to bring up a topic
[00:18:00.940 --> 00:18:03.500]   about the gospel at a workplace,
[00:18:03.500 --> 00:18:05.780]   but this is the best week to do it.
[00:18:05.780 --> 00:18:10.120]   And the call for us is that, to go outside the camp
[00:18:10.120 --> 00:18:13.060]   and do the things that are sometimes uncomfortable.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:15.500]   Maybe we will get persecuted for it,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:19.520]   but it's to glorify God and his kingdom.
[00:18:19.520 --> 00:18:22.100]   So I challenge you and I challenge myself
[00:18:22.100 --> 00:18:24.460]   that this week to really think about
[00:18:24.460 --> 00:18:26.300]   an opportunity to share the gospel,
[00:18:26.300 --> 00:18:29.200]   share the good news that we have heard
[00:18:29.200 --> 00:18:31.140]   and the blessing that we have received,
[00:18:31.140 --> 00:18:34.380]   his mercy and grace, and that we share that with others.
[00:18:34.380 --> 00:18:36.880]   So let's pray.
[00:18:36.880 --> 00:18:43.720]   Dear Heavenly Father, we just thank you, Lord God.
[00:18:43.720 --> 00:18:47.040]   We are so blessed in America.
[00:18:47.040 --> 00:18:49.360]   We are gathered together as believers,
[00:18:49.360 --> 00:18:54.240]   all with one heart in unison this morning
[00:18:54.240 --> 00:18:57.700]   to be able to come and worship you
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:19:00.140]   and think of you, Lord God.
[00:19:00.140 --> 00:19:02.940]   And you said where we are gathered together in a group
[00:19:02.940 --> 00:19:05.300]   where two or three are gathered, that you are there.
[00:19:05.300 --> 00:19:10.120]   So we know, Father, there is power in the gathering, Lord.
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:13.280]   I pray that this morning that we would've been challenged,
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.860]   we would have been just blessed, Lord,
[00:19:17.860 --> 00:19:21.620]   and Lord God, that you would use this morning, Lord,
[00:19:21.620 --> 00:19:24.480]   to focus our mind for this day,
[00:19:24.480 --> 00:19:26.820]   also focus our mind throughout the week.
[00:19:26.820 --> 00:19:29.960]   And Father, we pray that you will be glorified
[00:19:29.960 --> 00:19:32.420]   through just people talking about Easter
[00:19:32.420 --> 00:19:35.220]   and what it means, that you will be glorified.
[00:19:35.220 --> 00:19:38.340]   You will be glorified in how we speak,
[00:19:38.340 --> 00:19:40.900]   how we spend our time this week,
[00:19:40.900 --> 00:19:44.580]   how we think in our minds, that it will be a sacrifice,
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:47.120]   a pleasing sacrifice unto you.
[00:19:47.120 --> 00:19:49.720]   I thank you and I pray all this in Jesus' name, amen.
[00:19:49.720 --> 00:19:53.500]   And that's it, right?
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:54.820]   Okay, so that's it.
