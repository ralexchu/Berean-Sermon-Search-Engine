[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   [Music]
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   Tyler from Louisville, Kentucky, I think I pronounced that right this time, Louisville, Kentucky, asks,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   "My question is this, where would you point a new believer to start reading their Bible?
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   I have heard it suggested that John's Gospel is a good place to start. What do you say, Pastor John?"
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:28.000]   Well, as I thought about this, it would be easy to pick out one or two places and say, "Start there."
[00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000]   But here's what I think needs to be emphasized.
[00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   Let's make sure that we say to the new believer, "You are launching on a lifetime of Bible reading."
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   Say to yourself, "I've been a Christian 10 years," or for John Piper, it would be 63 years,
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:50.000]   "and I read my Bible every day."
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   You are launching out on a lifetime of engaging with God in the Bible.
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So build into their mindset, wherever you start, you're going forever.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:03.000]   You're going forever in the Bible.
[00:01:03.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   This is not about merely starting.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And you might point out to them, "You know, in my Bible, there's X number of pages in the New Testament,
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   and if you take three pages a day, you'll read the New Testament in three months."
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:20.000]   You could approach it that way.
[00:01:20.000 --> 00:01:26.000]   And just make sure they get the mindset, "I'm moving through all of this book.
[00:01:26.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   I'm not just taking a verse here and a verse there."
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   And here's another thing I would do.
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:36.000]   If they are utterly unacquainted with the New Testament, I would take five minutes
[00:01:36.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   and sit down with them and show them how the New Testament is laid out.
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   I would say, "Here are four books called Gospels, Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:50.000]   These are the books about the historical foundations of the life, death, and resurrection of Jesus."
[00:01:50.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Get that.
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   Number two, here's the book of Acts.
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:56.000]   This is the story of how the early church, after Jesus went back to heaven,
[00:01:56.000 --> 00:02:00.000]   got started and launched by the power of the Holy Spirit,
[00:02:00.000 --> 00:02:03.000]   and how the church took root because of what Jesus had done.
[00:02:03.000 --> 00:02:06.000]   And then here's this group called Letters.
[00:02:06.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   These are the authoritative apostles, the spokesmen for the risen Christ,
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   teaching the church how to live in the church and in society.
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:19.000]   And here's this strange book at the end called Revelation,
[00:02:19.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   which describes the victory of God at the end of the age.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   Now they've got the whole New Testament figured out, right?
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:28.000]   They've got Gospels, Acts, Epistles, Revelation.
[00:02:28.000 --> 00:02:30.000]   And say, "Now, you can jump in anywhere.
[00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   Know what you're jumping into."
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   And then you might say, "Well, look, since it's put together under God's guidance this way,
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   probably you should read it this way.
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   Let's just go from beginning to end and read the Gospels, read Acts, read Romans,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   and right on through the Epistles."
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   Or here's one last suggestion.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   You might say, "Look, if you'd like to go on the fast track here
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   and read one of these Gospels, one of these Epistles,
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   and maybe get the church history down, let's do it this way.
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:11.000]   Luke/Acts is one book."
[00:03:11.000 --> 00:03:12.000]   Then show them that.
[00:03:12.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   Show them the first verses of Luke, first verses of Acts, and how it's one volume.
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   They say, "Oh, that's cool.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   You've got one man writing a double volume about the foundations
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:23.000]   and then about the expansion of the church."
[00:03:23.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   And then say, "And by the way, he was a really good friend of a man named Paul,
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:32.000]   traveled with him for 20 years, and he wrote his biggest book, Romans.
[00:03:32.000 --> 00:03:34.000]   So stick that on too.
[00:03:34.000 --> 00:03:36.000]   So read Luke/Acts and Romans."
[00:03:36.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   And that might be a very concrete way to begin.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   Now, you've got to qualify like this, Tony.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   This might be a six-year-old you're talking to.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   It might be a blue-collar worker who finished eighth grade
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   and dropped out of school because of dyslexia and barely can read.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:59.000]   So you can't just make assumptions from what I've just said.
[00:03:59.000 --> 00:04:02.000]   What I just said may be so naive.
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   Here's the big picture.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:11.000]   A new believer needs a church with solid preaching, vital corporate worship,
[00:04:11.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   a small group of relationships where he can ask lots of questions
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:19.000]   and where if he's not a reader, he can get all the help in the world
[00:04:19.000 --> 00:04:22.000]   to make his way through little by little.
[00:04:22.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   So, in other words, know the person you're talking to
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.000]   and give them wise counsel based on what you know.
[00:04:28.000 --> 00:04:30.000]   Excellent. Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:04:30.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   And speaking of making sense of the Bible,
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   what do we need to do with this book called "The Song of Solomon"?
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   Is it to be read only literally as a communication between a husband and a wife,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   or does it hold allegorical meaning between Christ and the Church?
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   We'll be back to tackle that tomorrow.
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   Until then, I'm your host, Tony Reinke.
