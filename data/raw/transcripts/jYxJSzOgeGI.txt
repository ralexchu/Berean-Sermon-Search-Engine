[00:14:55.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   >> Good morning. Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:11.000]   We have quite a few announcements before we get started.
[00:15:11.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   First of all, our members meeting is happening at 2.30.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   And so that's enough time for you to go and grab lunch and be able to come back here.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   We're going to start right at 2.30.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   And today we have a service fair.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:29.000]   So all the different service teams that are serving our church are going to be all set up throughout the courtyard.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   And so you can visit that.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   Some of them is just for information, so you can get the information and just to know what's going on.
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:38.000]   Some of them, they're trying to recruit people to help out.
[00:15:38.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   And one of the questions that we get commonly is like, how can we jump in, how can we help out?
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:49.000]   So if you are in the process or you are a member of the church and you're not serving any specific capacity,
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   we invite you to come and just take a look at 2.30.
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So again, just enough time to go grab lunch and come back and we'll start right at 2.30.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   Also, the sign-ups for Seasons Fellowship, Fantastic Six.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   I think you've already gotten an email or a Facebook post on that.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:10.000]   If you are in the process of becoming a member or are currently a member, this is open for you.
[00:16:10.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   And this is for everybody who is 50 and over.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:15.000]   And I think I mentioned this before.
[00:16:15.000 --> 00:16:18.000]   To our surprise, we were expecting maybe about 30 people.
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:21.000]   Found that we have more than 70 scattered throughout.
[00:16:21.000 --> 00:16:22.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:22.000 --> 00:16:24.000]   We're very well hidden in this church.
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   And so if you are in that category, please sign up for that.
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   There will be a sign-up table outside.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:34.000]   So if you go outside after this service, there will be a table for you to go and sign up for that.
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:39.000]   And then Elder Phillip will give you whatever information that you need and they'll kind of group you together.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:45.000]   Again, anybody who is over 50 is, again, encouraged to sign up for that.
[00:16:45.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   FAM 245.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:51.000]   This is for people who've been married since I think 2019 is what Pastor Peter said.
[00:16:51.000 --> 00:16:59.000]   So if you are a fairly newlywed, which is probably half our church, you will qualify for this.
[00:16:59.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   So it's to encourage and to give you some guidance early on in your marriage to make sure that you have proper habits and to build a strong foundation in that.
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   So Pastor Peter Chung is leading that.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:12.000]   If you haven't signed up for it, you can sign up for it.
[00:17:12.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   Their next meeting is happening on May 28th.
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:21.000]   Another thing that's happening is the BCC service auction that's taking place in May.
[00:17:21.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   So those of you guys who participated last year, you know exactly what this is.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:30.000]   Basically, they're auctioning off certain items or services.
[00:17:30.000 --> 00:17:35.000]   And the proceeds that come in for that is going to go to adoption funds.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   So we have an adoption fund that church had set up to encourage young families or middle-aged families if you want to adopt children.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   And there's a scholarship that you can apply for after you go through the adoption process.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:52.000]   This is also open for embryonic adoption.
[00:17:52.000 --> 00:17:57.000]   So if you are going through that process, again, these funds are available for you.
[00:17:57.000 --> 00:18:00.000]   And so the funds that come in for this is going to be for that.
[00:18:00.000 --> 00:18:04.000]   If you have any questions about that, you can just ask later about it.
[00:18:04.000 --> 00:18:09.000]   And then lastly, our family ministry retreat is scheduled for August 12th through the 14th.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   August 12th through 14th.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:18.000]   I know it's a few months away, but we want to make sure that you try to block that out and try to get as many people to come to that as possible.
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:22.000]   That will be on a Friday, and then we'll be back on Sunday afternoon for that.
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   And this is for the family ministry in particular.
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   All right. I think that's all we have for this morning.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:32.000]   We'll take a minute to pray.
[00:18:32.000 --> 00:18:38.000]   And then again, if you are new to the church and you brought a physical offering, there's a box in the back right underneath that big clock.
[00:18:38.000 --> 00:18:39.000]   You can drop it off there.
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.000]   And otherwise, for the rest of us, we can take a minute.
[00:18:42.000 --> 00:18:45.000]   We'll give you a minute to give your offering electronically.
[00:18:45.000 --> 00:18:47.000]   All right. Let's pray.
[00:18:47.000 --> 00:18:53.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your continued grace.
[00:18:53.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   We thank you for your love.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   We thank you for persevering with us.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:00.000]   I pray that you would bless this time.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   May your name be praised, honored, glorified.
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:06.000]   Help us, Lord God, to give our full attention to you.
[00:19:06.000 --> 00:19:08.000]   I pray that you would bless this offering.
[00:19:08.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Help it, Lord God, to be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold for the sake of your name and your kingdom.
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:18.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.

[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:59.000]   Theophilus is probably watching all of this and is like, "What happened?"
[01:07:59.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   I remember Dr. Harris years ago, when he was at our church,
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   he said that you can tell the power of whatever hit the Earth by the effect.
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   So if you see the crater as miles and miles long,
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   you know that whatever hit it was powerful.
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   A nuclear bomb, or maybe an asteroid.
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   So if the crater is tiny, you know that the rock that hit it was tiny.
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   If you know that the crater goes miles and miles and miles,
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   then you know that there was something humongous.
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   You have to remember, in that short period of time, 25 years,
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:40.000]   that it would rock the known world at that time to this degree.
[01:08:40.000 --> 01:08:44.000]   It had to have been a huge, huge blast.
[01:08:44.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   A blast that human beings have not seen up to this point.
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:52.000]   If you only grew up in this modern generation, after the Internet,
[01:08:52.000 --> 01:08:54.000]   you have a hard time understanding that.
[01:08:54.000 --> 01:09:01.000]   I remember, before the Internet, some of you guys in the other fellowship.
[01:09:01.000 --> 01:09:06.000]   Fantastic Six Fellowship.
[01:09:06.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   You guys all remember, I remember in 1987, 1988,
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   I was up in Seattle and I attended this church.
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:17.000]   I remember worshipping, and the songs that they were singing
[01:09:17.000 --> 01:09:20.000]   were songs that I sang in elementary school and junior high school.
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:22.000]   This was a big church.
[01:09:22.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   In their English ministry, they were singing songs that we stopped singing 10 years ago.
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:34.000]   I remember coming back down and saying, "Wow, there's so much stuff happening where we're at."
[01:09:34.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   But it took that long.
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   I wasn't in the countryside.
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   This was one of the biggest churches in Seattle.
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:43.000]   But I remember thinking, "They're 10 years behind everything we do."
[01:09:43.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   Those of you guys who remember, even up to the '80s,
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:50.000]   everything that happened, happened in California and New York first.
[01:09:50.000 --> 01:09:53.000]   And then it would gradually spread.
[01:09:53.000 --> 01:09:58.000]   And it would take 10, 11, 12 years to get to the coastal areas,
[01:09:58.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   and then another 30, 40 years to the Midwest.
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:04.000]   It would just take that long to get information out.
[01:10:04.000 --> 01:10:09.000]   It had to be something fantastic in order for something to penetrate that far.
[01:10:09.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   And it would take that long.
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   Today, you just write something on the Internet,
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   and all of a sudden it goes viral.
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:21.000]   [laughter]
[01:10:21.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   Some of you guys don't know what I'm talking about.
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:25.000]   This is viral right there.
[01:10:25.000 --> 01:10:28.000]   Is it over?
[01:10:28.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   I don't know what this is called, but everybody's doing this.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   Somebody does this, and then the whole world is doing this.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   Deepest part of Africa, they're doing this.
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   What is this?
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:43.000]   Today, in order for information to spread, it's just instantaneous.
[01:10:43.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   You put it online, people like it.
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:48.000]   Somebody, you know, 15-year-old has 30 million followers,
[01:10:48.000 --> 01:10:51.000]   and all of a sudden it goes viral, and everybody becomes a cultural trend,
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   and the whole world changes.
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   Like that.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:57.000]   You want to become an author today?
[01:10:57.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   Just write a bunch of stuff and put it on Amazon.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   It's electronic copy.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:05.000]   Then you can say you're an author.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.000]   You get on and start a little blog and type a bunch of things,
[01:11:09.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   and maybe you're just talented, and you say something,
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:13.000]   and all of a sudden, he's an influencer.
[01:11:13.000 --> 01:11:18.000]   And then people are reading this thing, and people are sharing articles back and forth,
[01:11:18.000 --> 01:11:21.000]   and all of a sudden, there's a trend that takes place,
[01:11:21.000 --> 01:11:24.000]   and everybody's talking about it, even in the remotest part of the world.
[01:11:24.000 --> 01:11:26.000]   And all of a sudden, they have millions and millions of something
[01:11:26.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   that's being spread around, becoming popular.
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:31.000]   But when you go back, there's a 13-year-old in his basement
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   who's taking a break from playing video games
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:38.000]   and has become a mass worldwide influencer.
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:43.000]   Before the internet, it wasn't like that.
[01:11:43.000 --> 01:11:47.000]   If you wanted to become an author, a famous author,
[01:11:47.000 --> 01:11:50.000]   it usually started where you're at,
[01:11:50.000 --> 01:11:53.000]   and you had to have been tested by the group that you're with.
[01:11:53.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   And people would test you to see who you are.
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:59.000]   And then if you gain enough followers because you've been tested
[01:11:59.000 --> 01:12:01.000]   and your influence begins to grow,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   you may get beyond your local area
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:07.000]   and begin to have influence maybe in the county.
[01:12:07.000 --> 01:12:10.000]   And then after years and years of being proven
[01:12:10.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   in the county that you're at, it may possibly go national.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:17.000]   So when we were younger, you didn't have authors
[01:12:17.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   who were 20, 25, 30, 35-year-olds.
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:24.000]   Usually people who are influencers were in the 70s and 80s.
[01:12:24.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   But it didn't happen in your 20s because it took time
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   to test everything to get to that point.
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:36.000]   So by the time somebody writes something and it begins to spread,
[01:12:36.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   you know that there's 30, 40 years of testing of that person,
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:43.000]   testing of the knowledge, testing of information,
[01:12:43.000 --> 01:12:45.000]   before it started going viral.
[01:12:45.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   Today, this is all you need.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   Now why do I say all of this?
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:56.000]   This is just 30 years ago it was like that.
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   This is 2,000 years ago.
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   Just to get, even if a nuclear bomb went off,
[01:13:04.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   it may have taken months for that news to get to a certain area.
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   2,000 years ago.
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:16.000]   In 25 years, the world got rocked.
[01:13:16.000 --> 01:13:18.000]   It got rocked.
[01:13:18.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   And even before Paul would show up in some remote village,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:24.000]   they heard of him.
[01:13:24.000 --> 01:13:27.000]   Something happened.
[01:13:27.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   That a Roman official would commission a physician.
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:35.000]   I need record for this.
[01:13:35.000 --> 01:13:40.000]   To confirm, because what I'm hearing is crazy.
[01:13:40.000 --> 01:13:46.000]   Either this was the biggest hoax in human history,
[01:13:46.000 --> 01:13:49.000]   or Jesus came back from the dead.
[01:13:49.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   And what Luke is reporting is a careful eyewitness account
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   that he recorded of what was happening at that time.
[01:14:01.000 --> 01:14:03.000]   The whole world got rocked.
[01:14:03.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   And it's been tested for 2,000 years.
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   And it is just as powerful today as it was 2,000 years ago.
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   So is it worth studying the book of Luke?
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   Yes.
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   The power behind these words is not empty.
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   It's not just a collection of information that they threw together.
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:27.000]   Christ was resurrected.
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:31.000]   And he churned, and the history of mankind was reversed.
[01:14:31.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   The curse of mankind was reversed in Jesus Christ.
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   This is the record of that.
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   So I hope you guys are ready.
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   Whether it takes 10 years or 15 years.
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   I don't know how long we're going to be in this thing.
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:46.000]   But our goal is the same.
[01:14:46.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   That as we study the careful account,
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:55.000]   that we would come to the same conviction, without a doubt,
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   because the purpose of conviction is transformation.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:03.000]   That we would be convicted so that we may be transformed.
[01:15:03.000 --> 01:15:05.000]   Let's pray.
[01:15:05.000 --> 01:15:15.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your living word.
[01:15:15.000 --> 01:15:22.000]   We pray, Father God, with our feeble minds,
[01:15:22.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   our distracted hearts,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   help us, Lord God, to jump into this record
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:34.000]   that you've carefully put together.
[01:15:34.000 --> 01:15:37.000]   The same power that resurrected Christ
[01:15:37.000 --> 01:15:40.000]   would be the same power that we will encounter.
[01:15:40.000 --> 01:15:43.000]   So we pray that you would guide us, lead us,
[01:15:43.000 --> 01:15:46.000]   that we may be convicted, that we may be transformed
[01:15:46.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   for the sake of your name and your name alone.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:50.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:15:50.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   Why don't we all stand up for the closing praise?
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:16:14.000]   (music)
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   'Cross the shore a steady anchor in the fury of the storm
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:28.000]   When the winds of doubt blow through me
[01:16:28.000 --> 01:16:33.000]   And my sails have all been torn
[01:16:33.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   In the suffering, in the sorrow
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:42.000]   When my sinking hopes are few
[01:16:43.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:52.000]   It shall never be removed
[01:16:52.000 --> 01:16:59.000]   (music)
[01:16:59.000 --> 01:17:08.000]   'Cross the shore a steady anchor while the tempest rages on
[01:17:09.000 --> 01:17:17.000]   When temptation clears the battle and it saves the night as one
[01:17:17.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   Deeper still then grows the anchor
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:27.000]   Though I justly stand accused
[01:17:27.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   It shall never be removed
[01:17:38.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   (music)
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:52.000]   'Cross the shore a steady anchor through the floods of unbelief
[01:17:52.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   Hopeless somehow, oh my soul now
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:02.000]   Lift your eyes to joy
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   This my ballast of assurance, sin is love forever proved
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   I will hold fast to the anchor
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:22.000]   It shall never be removed
[01:18:22.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   It shall never be removed
[01:18:29.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   (music)
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   'Cross the shore
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   'Cross the shore a steady anchor as we face the wave of death

[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:05.000]   We will cross that great horizon, clouds we've had and lies secure
[01:19:05.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   And the bond will be the barrier for the sorrows that we endure
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:24.000]   'Cross the shore of our salvation, ever faithful, ever true
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   We will hold fast to the anchor

[01:19:35.000 --> 01:19:37.000]   Let's pray
[01:19:37.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:46.000]   Eternal love of God the Father
[01:19:47.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   Compel us, renew us, revive us, rebuke us, encourage us
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:59.000]   That wherever it is that you send us, that we may be the aroma of Christ
[01:19:59.000 --> 01:20:01.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen
[01:20:01.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   God sent his Son
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:11.000]   They called him Jesus
[01:20:11.000 --> 01:20:16.000]   He came to love
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:20.000]   Heal and forgive
[01:20:20.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   He lived and died
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   To buy my pardon
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:35.000]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:20:35.000 --> 01:20:39.000]   Savior lived
[01:20:39.000 --> 01:20:44.000]   Because he lived
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   I can face tomorrow
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   Because he lived
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   All fear is gone
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:04.000]   Because I know
[01:21:04.000 --> 01:21:08.000]   He holds the future
[01:21:08.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   And life is worth the living
[01:21:14.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   Just because he lives
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:21.000]   Amen

[01:21:25.000 --> 01:21:30.000]   How great, how sure
[01:21:30.000 --> 01:21:35.000]   His love endures
[01:21:35.000 --> 01:21:39.000]   Forevermore

[01:21:56.000 --> 01:22:01.000]   Could anything several take us from
