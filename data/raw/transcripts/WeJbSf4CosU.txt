[00:12:06.000 --> 00:12:08.000]   and I'm going to start with Pastor Peter Chung
[00:12:08.000 --> 00:12:10.500]   who is going to come up and he has some announcements
[00:12:10.500 --> 00:12:13.000]   about our shuttle system.
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:15.500]   >> All right, good morning.
[00:12:15.500 --> 00:12:18.000]   I just wanted to let you guys know
[00:12:18.000 --> 00:12:20.500]   over the last couple of months we've had a couple of
[00:12:20.500 --> 00:12:24.000]   incidences where people have invited people to church,
[00:12:24.000 --> 00:12:26.500]   but because they couldn't find parking,
[00:12:26.500 --> 00:12:29.000]   they just took off.
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:31.500]   And so we are having problems with our parking,
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:34.000]   we are having problems just with our seating.
[00:12:34.500 --> 00:12:37.500]   So we did start up a shuttle ministry
[00:12:37.500 --> 00:12:40.500]   that's actually going to start launching next Sunday.
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:44.500]   So the hours are, the times are 8.15, 10.15, 12.15,
[00:12:44.500 --> 00:12:48.500]   so every other hour on the 15th minute for about an hour.
[00:12:48.500 --> 00:12:53.500]   So if you guys can, if you want to park at the farther lots,
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:56.500]   the addresses are on there, audio images,
[00:12:56.500 --> 00:12:58.500]   and then the engineering firm,
[00:12:58.500 --> 00:13:00.500]   if you guys put that in your navigation
[00:13:00.500 --> 00:13:02.500]   and park at the far lots,
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   they have two golf carts and a shuttle van
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:08.000]   just running to bring you here.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:10.000]   Or you can just walk it.
[00:13:10.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   At most it will take seven minutes
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   if you have normal length legs.
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:16.000]   It's about a 785 step count.
[00:13:16.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   I actually did the numbers there.
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So it's not a far distance, but there will be a shuttle
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:23.000]   picking you up and bringing you here.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   So if you guys can, leave the closer lots
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:31.000]   for the parents of smaller children and newcomers,
[00:13:31.500 --> 00:13:33.500]   they're not going to quite know where to park.
[00:13:33.500 --> 00:13:36.500]   So that's the first request that we do have
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.500]   as our church is getting a little bit bigger.
[00:13:38.500 --> 00:13:41.000]   Today it doesn't look like as much of a problem,
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:44.500]   but normally our second service is pretty packed.
[00:13:44.500 --> 00:13:47.000]   So if our ushers ask you to move on up,
[00:13:47.000 --> 00:13:49.500]   please do, just oblige.
[00:13:49.500 --> 00:13:51.500]   Just get into the habit of sitting up closer
[00:13:51.500 --> 00:13:53.500]   so that as people arrive late,
[00:13:53.500 --> 00:13:55.500]   they can occupy the back seats.
[00:13:55.500 --> 00:13:57.500]   Don't glare at them.
[00:13:57.500 --> 00:14:00.000]   They are serving the Lord in the best way they can.
[00:14:00.500 --> 00:14:01.500]   So those are the two announcements.
[00:14:01.500 --> 00:14:03.500]   The shuttle service starts next week.
[00:14:03.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   So keep an eye out for that.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:09.500]   And please do participate the best you can
[00:14:09.500 --> 00:14:10.500]   with this request.
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:12.500]   Okay, thank you.
[00:14:12.500 --> 00:14:16.500]   - All right, so along with that, as you guys know,
[00:14:16.500 --> 00:14:18.000]   today is Father's Day.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:19.500]   And so as you're walking in,
[00:14:19.500 --> 00:14:21.500]   you probably saw the booths out there.
[00:14:21.500 --> 00:14:23.500]   And there is a picture taking place.
[00:14:23.500 --> 00:14:26.500]   So if you want to take pictures with your father,
[00:14:26.500 --> 00:14:29.500]   there's a station that's reserved for that.
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   And also the tables,
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:32.500]   you can just kind of go up and grab,
[00:14:32.500 --> 00:14:35.000]   I think they have lemonade cookies,
[00:14:35.000 --> 00:14:37.500]   homemade cookies that the children and the moms made.
[00:14:37.500 --> 00:14:40.000]   And then also beef jerky.
[00:14:40.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   Just make sure that's distinguished
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:43.500]   from Mother's Day and Father's Day.
[00:14:43.500 --> 00:14:45.000]   So that's going on.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:46.500]   So as you're going out,
[00:14:46.500 --> 00:14:48.000]   and if your wife is pregnant
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:50.500]   and you want to make an announcement today,
[00:14:50.500 --> 00:14:53.000]   you're also welcome to go to the table.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   And we'll quietly acknowledge what's going on.
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   Okay, so just go out there
[00:14:59.500 --> 00:15:00.500]   and make sure after service
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.500]   just go visit and grab your goodie bags, okay?
[00:15:03.500 --> 00:15:08.500]   Brian, membership class,
[00:15:08.500 --> 00:15:12.000]   the next session is starting on Sunday, July 9th.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:13.500]   So please sign up for that
[00:15:13.500 --> 00:15:15.500]   if you are intending to become a member of the church.
[00:15:15.500 --> 00:15:18.500]   And that's taking place July 9th through September 3rd,
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.500]   9 to 10, 20 a.m. in the other building.
[00:15:21.500 --> 00:15:23.000]   So if you haven't signed up for that,
[00:15:23.000 --> 00:15:24.500]   please sign up for that.
[00:15:24.500 --> 00:15:26.500]   Jubilee Fellowship, if you are 50 and over,
[00:15:26.500 --> 00:15:28.500]   on next Sunday at 1 p.m.
[00:15:29.000 --> 00:15:30.000]   for the second service,
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:31.500]   there will be a luncheon.
[00:15:31.500 --> 00:15:33.000]   So if you're 50 and over,
[00:15:33.000 --> 00:15:34.500]   and so that lunch is $12,
[00:15:34.500 --> 00:15:37.000]   and Elder Phillip is going to be taking charge of that,
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:39.500]   so please let him know that you are coming.
[00:15:39.500 --> 00:15:41.000]   One last announcement.
[00:15:41.000 --> 00:15:42.500]   All church retreat.
[00:15:42.500 --> 00:15:44.500]   We have quite a few who have already signed up,
[00:15:44.500 --> 00:15:49.000]   but because the hotel has given us a hard line June 25th
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:50.500]   as the last day that we can go
[00:15:50.500 --> 00:15:53.500]   and get the special rate that they've given us,
[00:15:53.500 --> 00:15:56.000]   and so if you haven't signed up,
[00:15:56.000 --> 00:15:58.500]   if you end up signing up after July 25th
[00:15:58.500 --> 00:16:00.500]   or June 25th, which is next Sunday,
[00:16:00.500 --> 00:16:02.000]   what's going to happen is
[00:16:02.000 --> 00:16:05.500]   there will be a separate retreat fee from the church,
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:07.500]   and then you will have to contact the hotel
[00:16:07.500 --> 00:16:12.000]   and end up paying the fee that they want you to pay,
[00:16:12.000 --> 00:16:14.500]   or you might have to go offsite to be able to do that.
[00:16:14.500 --> 00:16:18.000]   But if you are planning to go and you haven't,
[00:16:18.000 --> 00:16:19.500]   June 25th will be the last day
[00:16:19.500 --> 00:16:22.500]   that you'll be able to register through the normal way.
[00:16:22.500 --> 00:16:24.000]   Okay?
[00:16:24.000 --> 00:16:25.500]   I think that's it.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.000]   And one other thing is,
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:29.000]   we have our first Korea mission team
[00:16:29.000 --> 00:16:30.500]   that's going to be headed out,
[00:16:30.500 --> 00:16:34.000]   and we're going to the airport on the 22nd,
[00:16:34.000 --> 00:16:36.500]   and the 22nd is Thursday,
[00:16:36.500 --> 00:16:38.500]   and then we're flying out at 12 o'clock a.m.,
[00:16:38.500 --> 00:16:40.000]   and so that's happening.
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:41.500]   And so just to kind of give you a heads up,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.000]   there's 20 of us that are going.
[00:16:43.000 --> 00:16:45.500]   Pastor Nate and myself will be leading the team,
[00:16:45.500 --> 00:16:47.500]   and we're there for three weeks.
[00:16:47.500 --> 00:16:50.500]   And so there's quite a few things that we're doing.
[00:16:50.500 --> 00:16:53.500]   Our main goal is to reach the college campuses,
[00:16:53.500 --> 00:16:55.500]   the Korean-speaking students at Yonsei,
[00:16:56.000 --> 00:16:58.500]   at Hongdae, at Myeongji, and Ewha Womans University,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:17:00.500]   like that area.
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:03.000]   And so as I've mentioned before,
[00:17:03.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   our denomination,
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:08.000]   the mission wing of our denomination,
[00:17:08.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   they're called the International Mission Board, IMB,
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:14.000]   has designated South Korea as a receiving nation now.
[00:17:14.000 --> 00:17:16.000]   So for the longest time,
[00:17:16.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Korea was a sending nation,
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:20.000]   meaning it was the second largest missionary
[00:17:20.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   sending nation in the world.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   But as quickly as Christianity inclined
[00:17:25.500 --> 00:17:29.000]   in Korea, it is declining at an alarming speed.
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:31.000]   So there's previously,
[00:17:31.000 --> 00:17:33.500]   the number of people who claim to be Christian
[00:17:33.500 --> 00:17:35.000]   was about 33%,
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:36.500]   but now when we get to the Gen Z,
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:38.500]   the students, college students and younger,
[00:17:38.500 --> 00:17:40.500]   is less than 3%.
[00:17:40.500 --> 00:17:42.000]   Some is less than 2%.
[00:17:42.000 --> 00:17:43.500]   So in one generation,
[00:17:43.500 --> 00:17:46.500]   that many people are walking out of the church,
[00:17:46.500 --> 00:17:49.500]   and so they're inviting people to come
[00:17:49.500 --> 00:17:51.500]   back out to South Korea,
[00:17:51.500 --> 00:17:53.500]   and they're starting to send mission teams out there.
[00:17:53.500 --> 00:17:55.000]   And so we're one of the first teams
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:17:56.000]   that are going in,
[00:17:56.000 --> 00:17:57.500]   hoping to make contact there.
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:17:59.500]   And sad thing is,
[00:17:59.500 --> 00:18:02.000]   that they're not close to Christianity.
[00:18:02.000 --> 00:18:05.000]   They've been so disappointed by Christianity in Korea,
[00:18:05.000 --> 00:18:07.500]   they're more willing to talk to foreign students
[00:18:07.500 --> 00:18:09.000]   to share the gospel with them.
[00:18:09.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   And so it kind of puts them in a unique place
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:13.000]   where we can go and share the gospel,
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:15.500]   even though they'll speak broken English,
[00:18:15.500 --> 00:18:18.000]   they're more willing to talk to us about Christianity,
[00:18:18.000 --> 00:18:21.000]   because they know how much of a positive impact
[00:18:21.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   Christianity has had in that country.
[00:18:23.500 --> 00:18:25.000]   Most of the universities, hospitals,
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:26.500]   major stuff in Korea,
[00:18:26.500 --> 00:18:29.000]   has some sort of a mission work behind it.
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:31.500]   So they know that Christianity was vital
[00:18:31.500 --> 00:18:33.500]   to the success of Korea.
[00:18:33.500 --> 00:18:34.500]   And so they're open.
[00:18:34.500 --> 00:18:36.000]   They have positive views of Christianity,
[00:18:36.000 --> 00:18:38.500]   but they don't trust Christianity in Korea.
[00:18:38.500 --> 00:18:41.000]   So when other missionaries and other people come,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:42.500]   they're more willing to talk to us.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:44.500]   So we're trying to use that as an opening
[00:18:44.500 --> 00:18:46.500]   to go in and share the gospel.
[00:18:46.500 --> 00:18:48.000]   So while we're there for three weeks,
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:50.500]   we're going to be engaged in street evangelism,
[00:18:50.500 --> 00:18:52.000]   busking, if you know what that is,
[00:18:52.500 --> 00:18:53.500]   that's the first thing that I, you know,
[00:18:53.500 --> 00:18:55.000]   the new term that I learned.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   They're street performing and attracting people.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.000]   We have open cafe, English cafes,
[00:18:59.000 --> 00:19:01.500]   where we're going to be sharing the gospel with people.
[00:19:01.500 --> 00:19:03.500]   We're going to be doing some homeless ministry.
[00:19:03.500 --> 00:19:05.500]   We're going to be visiting orphanages.
[00:19:05.500 --> 00:19:07.000]   We're running an English camp
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.500]   to recruit students and share the gospel with them.
[00:19:09.500 --> 00:19:11.000]   We're running an international camp.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:12.500]   So we're going to be very busy
[00:19:12.500 --> 00:19:14.500]   during the three weeks that we're there.
[00:19:14.500 --> 00:19:16.500]   So if you guys can keep us in your prayers
[00:19:16.500 --> 00:19:18.500]   that we will be fruitful.
[00:19:18.500 --> 00:19:20.500]   And we're praying that the contacts
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:22.500]   that we make this year will help us
[00:19:22.500 --> 00:19:25.000]   to focus our attention on where would be
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.500]   the most fruitful and effective way
[00:19:27.500 --> 00:19:29.000]   to go out there and start ministry.
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:30.500]   So we're leaving this Thursday
[00:19:30.500 --> 00:19:32.500]   and we'll be out for about three weeks.
[00:19:32.500 --> 00:19:34.000]   And then we'll be back.
[00:19:34.000 --> 00:19:36.000]   Okay, so please keep that in your prayer.
[00:19:36.000 --> 00:19:38.000]   After I pray for the offering,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   our brother Daniel is going to come up
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   and he's going to give his testimony and be baptized.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:43.500]   And those of you who have physical offerings,
[00:19:43.500 --> 00:19:46.000]   again, we have a box in the back on the way out.
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:47.500]   You can drop off your offering there
[00:19:47.500 --> 00:19:49.000]   if you have a physical offering.
[00:19:49.000 --> 00:19:50.500]   All right, let's pray.
[00:19:51.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:54.500]   for your continued blessing over our lives.
[00:19:54.500 --> 00:19:56.500]   We thank you for the opportunity
[00:19:56.500 --> 00:19:58.500]   that you've given us.
[00:19:58.500 --> 00:20:01.500]   That we can be the light wherever you send us.
[00:20:01.500 --> 00:20:04.500]   Not only in Korea, India, China,
[00:20:04.500 --> 00:20:07.500]   and various places, Lord God, that you have sent us.
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:09.500]   Help us, Lord, first and foremost,
[00:20:09.500 --> 00:20:11.500]   to be missionaries at home.
[00:20:11.500 --> 00:20:14.500]   Help us, Lord, to live as if we're just passing through.
[00:20:14.500 --> 00:20:17.500]   To see things from an eternal perspective.
[00:20:17.500 --> 00:20:19.500]   To see things from a spiritual perspective.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:22.500]   Help us to be a light in this dark world.
[00:20:22.500 --> 00:20:24.500]   That all that we do, Father God,
[00:20:24.500 --> 00:20:26.500]   would bring glory to your name.
[00:20:26.500 --> 00:20:28.500]   We pray that even in our offering,
[00:20:28.500 --> 00:20:31.500]   that you would help us to give in a manner of worship.
[00:20:31.500 --> 00:20:35.500]   That it may be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:20:35.500 --> 00:20:37.500]   for the purpose of your kingdom.
[00:20:37.500 --> 00:20:39.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:01.500]   as we continue our worship.
[00:22:01.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   As we gather together each week,
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:08.500]   I'm reminded that what we do is entirely different
[00:22:08.500 --> 00:22:11.500]   from anything the world gathers together to do.
[00:22:11.500 --> 00:22:15.500]   That begins with God's presence among his people.
[00:22:15.500 --> 00:22:18.500]   So as we continue to worship,
[00:22:18.500 --> 00:22:21.500]   let us welcome, let us cherish that presence
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:23.500]   that is among us and how God works
[00:22:23.500 --> 00:22:25.500]   in the midst of his people.
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:27.500]   So praise him for that.

[00:31:50.580 --> 00:32:03.500]   - Hi there, my name is Daniel.
[00:32:03.500 --> 00:32:05.500]   If I do cough during this testimony,
[00:32:05.500 --> 00:32:07.500]   I hope that you can excuse me.
[00:32:13.500 --> 00:32:18.500]   My parents and my oldest brother moved to America in 1993.
[00:32:18.500 --> 00:32:21.500]   Within the next four years,
[00:32:21.500 --> 00:32:23.500]   my mother bore three additional sons,
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:25.500]   with me being the youngest boy.
[00:32:25.500 --> 00:32:28.500]   After an additional three years,
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:31.500]   my parents felt called by God
[00:32:31.500 --> 00:32:34.500]   to move back to Asia, into China.
[00:32:34.500 --> 00:32:40.500]   With no choice, we followed our parents to a new world.
[00:32:41.500 --> 00:32:45.500]   Growing up in China, my parents taught me everything
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:48.500]   they knew about God and Christianity.
[00:32:48.500 --> 00:32:51.500]   Knowing that we were being raised in a country
[00:32:51.500 --> 00:32:54.500]   that was hostile towards Christians,
[00:32:54.500 --> 00:32:58.500]   they made sure and prayed for other missionary families
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.500]   to arrive and provide support
[00:33:00.500 --> 00:33:04.500]   for both them and us four boys.
[00:33:04.500 --> 00:33:08.500]   God answered their prayers,
[00:33:08.500 --> 00:33:11.500]   and as more missionary families arrived,
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:16.500]   we were able to create a missionary community.
[00:33:16.500 --> 00:33:20.500]   We would live life with one another,
[00:33:20.500 --> 00:33:24.500]   pray for one another, and support one another.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.500]   However, as years passed,
[00:33:28.500 --> 00:33:31.500]   being a missionary kid and a Christian
[00:33:31.500 --> 00:33:35.500]   was just a way of life and nothing more.
[00:33:36.500 --> 00:33:41.500]   I lacked true, consistent authenticity in my beliefs,
[00:33:41.500 --> 00:33:45.500]   and merely learned to act like a Christian,
[00:33:45.500 --> 00:33:47.500]   whilst knowing what it took to look like
[00:33:47.500 --> 00:33:51.500]   the good Christian kid I thought I was supposed to be.
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:54.500]   As my brothers all graduated
[00:33:54.500 --> 00:33:57.500]   and moved back to America for college,
[00:33:57.500 --> 00:34:00.500]   my parents sent me to Thailand,
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:02.500]   where I lived in a dorm
[00:34:02.500 --> 00:34:05.500]   and graduated from an international high school.
[00:34:06.500 --> 00:34:08.500]   I moved back to America,
[00:34:08.500 --> 00:34:10.500]   where I attended Wheaton College,
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   a Christian college in Illinois.
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:18.500]   However, despite attending a Christian college,
[00:34:18.500 --> 00:34:20.500]   I continued to live a life
[00:34:20.500 --> 00:34:24.500]   that held onto the desires of the world.
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:27.500]   After my four years of undergrad,
[00:34:27.500 --> 00:34:30.500]   I graduated and moved to Chicago for two years,
[00:34:30.500 --> 00:34:33.500]   and then to Irvine two years after that.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:38.500]   Because my parents were missionaries,
[00:34:38.500 --> 00:34:41.500]   I had to learn to become independent
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:44.500]   and self-sufficient early on in my life,
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:46.500]   as I stayed in the mission field
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:50.500]   while I left them at the early age of 15 in Thailand.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.500]   With no safety net and no permanent family base,
[00:34:55.500 --> 00:35:00.500]   self-preservation became essential for me.
[00:35:01.500 --> 00:35:05.500]   During school, as all my friends left to go home,
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.500]   I needed to figure out where I would be living
[00:35:08.500 --> 00:35:10.500]   before the next school year would start.
[00:35:10.500 --> 00:35:15.500]   I worked all year round to support myself financially
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:18.500]   and began to learn how to cook Korean and Chinese food
[00:35:18.500 --> 00:35:24.500]   to save money to also grasp onto any bit of home that felt familiar.
[00:35:24.500 --> 00:35:30.500]   I felt so alone and abandoned.
[00:35:31.500 --> 00:35:34.500]   I was bitter and angry at God
[00:35:34.500 --> 00:35:39.500]   and was so tired of just living to survive.
[00:35:39.500 --> 00:35:45.500]   But deep down, I longed to be saved
[00:35:45.500 --> 00:35:49.500]   and knew that God was the ultimate truth.
[00:35:49.500 --> 00:35:54.500]   When I moved here to Irvine,
[00:35:54.500 --> 00:35:57.500]   I expressed a desire to come back to church.
[00:35:57.500 --> 00:36:00.500]   A year from my move, I started to attend a Korean
[00:36:00.500 --> 00:36:03.500]   and was invited to come out to Bible study.
[00:36:03.500 --> 00:36:06.500]   I continued to attend Sunday service,
[00:36:06.500 --> 00:36:10.500]   Bible study, and church-organized events.
[00:36:10.500 --> 00:36:14.500]   Gradually, day by day,
[00:36:14.500 --> 00:36:19.500]   God started to heal my heart and to reveal himself to me.
[00:36:19.500 --> 00:36:24.500]   One night, as I was alone in my room,
[00:36:24.500 --> 00:36:29.500]   I broke down as I realized that he had never left me,
[00:36:29.500 --> 00:36:32.500]   even in my lowest moments,
[00:36:32.500 --> 00:36:35.500]   and that he had been with me every step of the way
[00:36:35.500 --> 00:36:38.500]   throughout my entire life.
[00:36:38.500 --> 00:36:46.500]   Even when I cursed him
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:50.500]   and gave up on him countless times,
[00:36:52.500 --> 00:36:57.500]   he still waited patiently to welcome me back into his loving arms.
[00:36:57.500 --> 00:37:03.500]   As I saw and felt his love,
[00:37:03.500 --> 00:37:07.500]   I felt so unworthy of it and was in disbelief
[00:37:07.500 --> 00:37:11.500]   that he sees me even after all of my sin
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:15.500]   and all the hatred I held towards him.
[00:37:15.500 --> 00:37:19.500]   I know and trust in his love
[00:37:19.500 --> 00:37:23.500]   because the life that I have lived up to this point
[00:37:23.500 --> 00:37:27.500]   of living abroad as a missionary family,
[00:37:27.500 --> 00:37:31.500]   of being sent away from family for schooling,
[00:37:31.500 --> 00:37:37.500]   of learning to live and figure out life independently on my own,
[00:37:37.500 --> 00:37:43.500]   all of this is a testament to his faithfulness to me.
[00:37:43.500 --> 00:37:48.500]   Even when I felt like I was navigating life on my own,
[00:37:48.500 --> 00:37:52.500]   he always opened and closed the right doors,
[00:37:52.500 --> 00:37:56.500]   brought me the right people at the right times,
[00:37:56.500 --> 00:38:01.500]   and never provided less than what I needed.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:06.500]   As I reflected then and there in my room,
[00:38:06.500 --> 00:38:10.500]   I repented of a life of self-seeking
[00:38:10.500 --> 00:38:14.500]   and having myself as the number one priority
[00:38:14.500 --> 00:38:18.500]   and vowed instead to dedicate my life
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:23.500]   to seeking out his will and to glorify him always.
[00:38:23.500 --> 00:38:29.500]   Since then, I have dedicated my life to him
[00:38:29.500 --> 00:38:34.500]   and have strived to put him first before my own life.
[00:38:34.500 --> 00:38:40.500]   I have looked to him to transform my old life into a new one,
[00:38:40.500 --> 00:38:44.500]   with him at the center of it all.
[00:38:44.500 --> 00:38:47.500]   And even through my failures,
[00:38:47.500 --> 00:38:51.500]   I pray that he would use them to grow and strengthen me
[00:38:51.500 --> 00:38:55.500]   to love him and those around me even more.
[00:38:55.500 --> 00:39:00.500]   I know this is just the beginning of my journey,
[00:39:00.500 --> 00:39:04.500]   but out of the sincerity of my heart,
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:09.500]   I long to know and love him more each and every day.
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:13.500]   I understand that it will not be easy,
[00:39:13.500 --> 00:39:16.500]   but if this is the path to take,
[00:39:16.500 --> 00:39:18.500]   then I refuse to live an easy life.
[00:39:18.500 --> 00:39:20.500]   Thank you.
[00:39:20.500 --> 00:39:29.500]   [applause]
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:42.500]   [silence]
[00:39:42.500 --> 00:39:44.500]   Do you understand when you go into the water,
[00:39:44.500 --> 00:39:46.500]   you're being united to Christ's death?
[00:39:46.500 --> 00:39:49.500]   When you're coming out, you're united to the resurrected life?
[00:39:49.500 --> 00:39:54.500]   I baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:39:54.500 --> 00:39:56.500]   Amen.
[00:39:56.500 --> 00:40:11.500]   [applause]
[00:40:11.500 --> 00:40:16.500]   Thank you, Daniel, for that powerful testimony.
[00:40:16.500 --> 00:40:20.500]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Galatians 4.
[00:40:24.500 --> 00:40:26.500]   Verse 6 and 7.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:29.500]   So it is Father's Day,
[00:40:29.500 --> 00:40:34.500]   and we wanted to take at least today to address an issue of
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:37.500]   what does it mean to be a father.
[00:40:37.500 --> 00:40:40.500]   So I'll be reading from Galatians 4, 6 and 7.
[00:40:40.500 --> 00:40:48.500]   "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of his Son
[00:40:48.500 --> 00:40:51.500]   into our hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:40:51.500 --> 00:40:54.500]   Therefore you are no longer a slave, but a son;
[00:40:54.500 --> 00:40:56.500]   and if a son, then an heir through God."
[00:40:56.500 --> 00:40:58.500]   Let's pray.
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:04.500]   Heavenly Father, we pray for wisdom.
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.500]   We pray for grace.
[00:41:07.500 --> 00:41:11.500]   We pray for hearts that are eager to be molded,
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:17.500]   that we do not filter your word based upon our own prejudice,
[00:41:17.500 --> 00:41:20.500]   our own desires of the flesh.
[00:41:20.500 --> 00:41:23.500]   Help us not to conform to the pattern of this world,
[00:41:23.500 --> 00:41:26.500]   but be transformed by the renewing of our mind
[00:41:26.500 --> 00:41:29.500]   according to your word.
[00:41:29.500 --> 00:41:32.500]   Teach us, guide us, lead us, rebuke us, establish us,
[00:41:32.500 --> 00:41:34.500]   sanctify us.
[00:41:34.500 --> 00:41:36.500]   We entrust this time to you, Lord.
[00:41:36.500 --> 00:41:38.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:41:38.500 --> 00:41:41.500]   I think those of you guys who have been at our church for a while
[00:41:41.500 --> 00:41:44.500]   know that years ago, every Mother's Day and Father's Day,
[00:41:44.500 --> 00:41:47.500]   I used to give Mother's Day sermons and Father's Day sermon,
[00:41:47.500 --> 00:41:49.500]   and I kind of stopped that for a little bit
[00:41:49.500 --> 00:41:54.500]   and spent the day glorifying somebody else outside of our Heavenly Father.
[00:41:54.500 --> 00:42:00.500]   But I did want to spend at least today talking about what it means to be a father
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:03.500]   because of what's happening in our culture.
[00:42:03.500 --> 00:42:06.500]   If you guys know, in 1 Corinthians 16, 13,
[00:42:06.500 --> 00:42:11.500]   the context of this verse is where Apostle Paul spends the whole letter
[00:42:11.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   kind of rebuking and challenging the leaders and the members of the church in Corinth.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:21.500]   All kinds of chaos has been coming into this church.
[00:42:21.500 --> 00:42:27.500]   There's division, immorality, the worship was done in vain,
[00:42:27.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   it was out of order for seeking self-glory.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:33.500]   And so as a result of that, the church was being ruined.
[00:42:33.500 --> 00:42:39.500]   And so after chapters of writing and what to be corrected,
[00:42:39.500 --> 00:42:44.500]   in 1 Corinthians 16, 13, Paul kind of concludes the letter by saying,
[00:42:44.500 --> 00:42:49.500]   "Be on alert, stand firm in the faith, and act like men, be strong."
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:51.500]   Act like men.
[00:42:51.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   In the NIV, it says to be men of courage.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:59.500]   And the reason why the NIV translated it that way is because it's--
[00:42:59.500 --> 00:43:01.500]   what does it mean to act like men?
[00:43:01.500 --> 00:43:05.500]   So they've kind of translated it, so, well, it means to be courageous.
[00:43:05.500 --> 00:43:10.500]   In the Greek, that's not how it's spelled or formulated.
[00:43:10.500 --> 00:43:12.500]   It just says act like men.
[00:43:12.500 --> 00:43:15.500]   You should have understood what that meant, act like men.
[00:43:15.500 --> 00:43:19.500]   But what does that mean today, to act like men?
[00:43:19.500 --> 00:43:21.500]   Be a man. What does that mean?
[00:43:21.500 --> 00:43:25.500]   In fact, it almost sounds like it's wrong to say be a man
[00:43:25.500 --> 00:43:27.500]   because of the culture that we live in.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:31.500]   You're a misogynist, you're a sexist, you're toxic masculinity.
[00:43:31.500 --> 00:43:33.500]   What does it mean to be a man?
[00:43:33.500 --> 00:43:38.500]   We need to make sure that we have a clear biblical understanding
[00:43:38.500 --> 00:43:40.500]   of what it means to be a man,
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:46.500]   that we do not follow the pattern that we are being forced in our culture,
[00:43:46.500 --> 00:43:50.500]   in schools, in our universities, and even at work.
[00:43:50.500 --> 00:43:52.500]   What does it mean to be a man?
[00:43:52.500 --> 00:43:56.500]   You know, it's interesting that Time magazine had an article in May 22nd,
[00:43:56.500 --> 00:43:59.500]   in the year 2000, called "The Hottest Jobs of the Future."
[00:43:59.500 --> 00:44:03.500]   And obviously, the year 2000, there was a revolution of computers
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:06.500]   that were taking place and the world was going to change,
[00:44:06.500 --> 00:44:10.500]   and they were saying that in this article,
[00:44:10.500 --> 00:44:14.500]   that there are some jobs that are going to become obsolete
[00:44:14.500 --> 00:44:18.500]   in the next century because of the computer revolution.
[00:44:18.500 --> 00:44:23.500]   And in the list of jobs that are disappearing in the next century,
[00:44:23.500 --> 00:44:27.500]   it says fatherhood is going to disappear.
[00:44:27.500 --> 00:44:30.500]   The occupation or the position of father is going to disappear.
[00:44:30.500 --> 00:44:33.500]   And in the article, it says in between,
[00:44:33.500 --> 00:44:37.500]   "Ditro fertilization and cloning, dads could become dinosaurs."
[00:44:37.500 --> 00:44:41.500]   That's what it says in this article, and this was written in the year 2000.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:45.500]   Now, 23 years have gone by, and you could see now
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   how the world has become hostile toward fatherhood
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:53.500]   and just manhood in general.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.500]   In fact, it's beginning to penetrate into the church.
[00:44:57.500 --> 00:45:01.500]   Certain doctrines that we have held for centuries are being challenged,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:04.500]   not because of new revelation of what the Bible says,
[00:45:04.500 --> 00:45:08.500]   because of the pressure of the secular world.
[00:45:08.500 --> 00:45:11.500]   Some of you guys may remember, not that long ago,
[00:45:11.500 --> 00:45:14.500]   we switched from using the NIV to NASB,
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:19.500]   and the main reason why is because the people who own the rights to the NIV
[00:45:19.500 --> 00:45:25.500]   has publicly stated that they are going to make all the pronouns gender neutral.
[00:45:25.500 --> 00:45:30.500]   Not because the Bible--they found some new revelation in the Bible,
[00:45:30.500 --> 00:45:34.500]   but simply because they needed to sell more Bibles.
[00:45:34.500 --> 00:45:38.500]   That if they don't make it gender neutral, it's not going to be palatable to the masses.
[00:45:38.500 --> 00:45:41.500]   So in order to keep their business alive,
[00:45:41.500 --> 00:45:43.500]   they said they're going to make everything gender neutral,
[00:45:43.500 --> 00:45:46.500]   or else the Bible's not going to sell, and the NIV's going to die,
[00:45:46.500 --> 00:45:48.500]   so in order for their own survival.
[00:45:48.500 --> 00:45:52.500]   Since then, many translations, even the more literal translations,
[00:45:52.500 --> 00:45:54.500]   are beginning to cave to pressure.
[00:45:54.500 --> 00:45:57.500]   And that pressure basically is if we do not go gender neutral,
[00:45:57.500 --> 00:46:00.500]   you're not going to be able to survive as a business.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:04.500]   You can hold on to your principles, but what good is it if you can't sell Bibles?
[00:46:04.500 --> 00:46:08.500]   So more and more, Bible translations are turning to gender neutral,
[00:46:08.500 --> 00:46:12.500]   and as a result of that, it's beginning to confuse the church,
[00:46:12.500 --> 00:46:14.500]   and even the pulpit.
[00:46:14.500 --> 00:46:18.500]   What does it mean to be a man?
[00:46:18.500 --> 00:46:21.500]   Any of you who own pets, right?
[00:46:21.500 --> 00:46:25.500]   I don't know if all of you have done it, but even the cats that we have,
[00:46:25.500 --> 00:46:28.500]   it was kind of a given understanding that if you're going to own pets,
[00:46:28.500 --> 00:46:31.500]   you have to neuter them, right?
[00:46:31.500 --> 00:46:34.500]   Not have to, but you just kind of--that's just the culture.
[00:46:34.500 --> 00:46:37.500]   And the whole purpose of neutering them is so that they can't reproduce.
[00:46:37.500 --> 00:46:40.500]   You don't want unwanted cats or dogs running around,
[00:46:40.500 --> 00:46:42.500]   and so if you want to own a pet,
[00:46:42.500 --> 00:46:45.500]   and purely for the enjoyment of the owners.
[00:46:45.500 --> 00:46:48.500]   I can't think of a more fitting illustration
[00:46:48.500 --> 00:46:51.500]   about what's going on with our pets
[00:46:51.500 --> 00:46:54.500]   to what's happening with our men in our culture.
[00:46:54.500 --> 00:46:57.500]   Men are becoming neutered,
[00:46:57.500 --> 00:47:00.500]   and the purpose of neutering is so that you cannot reproduce.
[00:47:00.500 --> 00:47:04.500]   That whatever was passed down from generation, that it's going to stop here.
[00:47:04.500 --> 00:47:08.500]   And they are actively trying to neuter manhood
[00:47:08.500 --> 00:47:10.500]   so that people are confused.
[00:47:10.500 --> 00:47:12.500]   What does it mean to be a man? What does it mean to be a father?
[00:47:12.500 --> 00:47:14.500]   What is the call of a father?
[00:47:14.500 --> 00:47:20.500]   And so that's why I felt compelled to address this issue in our church,
[00:47:20.500 --> 00:47:22.500]   and there might be some things that I will say
[00:47:22.500 --> 00:47:26.500]   that may not be comfortable with some of you in the church,
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:31.500]   but in order to make a stand against what's happening in our culture,
[00:47:31.500 --> 00:47:33.500]   I felt it necessary, at least today,
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:38.500]   to clarify what the scripture teaches of the calling of man.
[00:47:38.500 --> 00:47:41.500]   The origin of understanding of God the Father,
[00:47:41.500 --> 00:47:46.500]   it actually has--it's placed in the Bible from the beginning.
[00:47:46.500 --> 00:47:49.500]   God himself calls himself the Father of Israel,
[00:47:49.500 --> 00:47:52.500]   but it's almost never used in a personal sense
[00:47:52.500 --> 00:47:55.500]   where an individual calls God the Father.
[00:47:55.500 --> 00:47:59.500]   That idea of a personal relationship of God being the Father
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:02.500]   is introduced to us by Christ.
[00:48:02.500 --> 00:48:10.500]   He uses 165 different times in the Bible to address God as Father.
[00:48:10.500 --> 00:48:13.500]   Prior to that, it would be Elohim or Lord,
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:15.500]   and his name may have been used,
[00:48:15.500 --> 00:48:19.500]   or it would be God addressing Israel as himself as the Father.
[00:48:19.500 --> 00:48:23.500]   But this personal address as God being the Father
[00:48:23.500 --> 00:48:27.500]   was pretty much introduced by Christ himself.
[00:48:27.500 --> 00:48:32.500]   In Mark 14, verse 36, Jesus calls God Abba Father
[00:48:32.500 --> 00:48:34.500]   as he is wrestling at the Garden of Gethsemane,
[00:48:34.500 --> 00:48:36.500]   if there another way.
[00:48:36.500 --> 00:48:40.500]   And then it's spelled out in John 5, 16-18,
[00:48:40.500 --> 00:48:43.500]   and it gives the reason why they hated Jesus,
[00:48:43.500 --> 00:48:45.500]   and this is what it says.
[00:48:45.500 --> 00:48:48.500]   "For this reason the Jews were persecuting Jesus
[00:48:48.500 --> 00:48:51.500]   because he was doing these things on the Sabbath.
[00:48:51.500 --> 00:48:53.500]   But he answered them, 'My Father is working until now,
[00:48:53.500 --> 00:48:55.500]   and I myself am working.
[00:48:55.500 --> 00:48:58.500]   For this reason, therefore, the Jews were seeking all the more
[00:48:58.500 --> 00:49:01.500]   to kill him because he not only was breaking the Sabbath,
[00:49:01.500 --> 00:49:03.500]   but also was calling God his own Father,
[00:49:03.500 --> 00:49:05.500]   making himself equal with God.'"
[00:49:05.500 --> 00:49:08.500]   Did you notice that? He says, "For this reason."
[00:49:08.500 --> 00:49:10.500]   They are persecuting Jesus
[00:49:10.500 --> 00:49:13.500]   because he was not obeying the Sabbath law.
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:15.500]   And so they were breaking their tradition,
[00:49:15.500 --> 00:49:17.500]   so they were persecuting him.
[00:49:17.500 --> 00:49:20.500]   But he said they wanted to kill him for this reason,
[00:49:20.500 --> 00:49:22.500]   because he started calling God his Father,
[00:49:22.500 --> 00:49:25.500]   making himself equal with God.
[00:49:25.500 --> 00:49:29.500]   What's interesting about the introduction of this term,
[00:49:29.500 --> 00:49:34.500]   or at least the way Jesus is addressing God,
[00:49:34.500 --> 00:49:38.500]   is something that he did not only for himself,
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:40.500]   but the whole reason why he came
[00:49:40.500 --> 00:49:43.500]   is so that we may be restored
[00:49:43.500 --> 00:49:46.500]   to our personal relationship with God the Father.
[00:49:46.500 --> 00:49:48.500]   That he's not just some being from a distance,
[00:49:48.500 --> 00:49:51.500]   that somebody that we admire from a distance,
[00:49:51.500 --> 00:49:55.500]   but that he wanted to make God our Abba Father.
[00:49:55.500 --> 00:49:57.500]   So in Romans 8, 15-17, it says,
[00:49:57.500 --> 00:50:00.500]   "For you have not received the spirit of slavery,
[00:50:00.500 --> 00:50:02.500]   leading to the fear again,
[00:50:02.500 --> 00:50:04.500]   but you have received the spirit of adoption as sons,
[00:50:04.500 --> 00:50:07.500]   by which we cry, 'Abba, Father.'"
[00:50:07.500 --> 00:50:11.500]   The whole purpose of salvation is our adoption.
[00:50:11.500 --> 00:50:15.500]   Not simply so that he can save us from hell,
[00:50:15.500 --> 00:50:17.500]   not simply so that your sins could be forgiven,
[00:50:17.500 --> 00:50:20.500]   but your sins needed to be forgiven.
[00:50:20.500 --> 00:50:22.500]   Our sins had to be atoned for
[00:50:22.500 --> 00:50:24.500]   in order that we may be adopted,
[00:50:24.500 --> 00:50:28.500]   that we too may be able to call God our Abba Father.
[00:50:28.500 --> 00:50:30.500]   Verse 18, "For this reason,"
[00:50:30.500 --> 00:50:33.500]   sorry, verse 16, "the Spirit himself testifies with our spirit
[00:50:33.500 --> 00:50:36.500]   that we are children of God, and if children, heirs also,
[00:50:36.500 --> 00:50:39.500]   heirs of God, and fellow heirs with Christ,
[00:50:39.500 --> 00:50:41.500]   if indeed we suffer with him,
[00:50:41.500 --> 00:50:44.500]   so that we may also be glorified with him."
[00:50:44.500 --> 00:50:46.500]   And again, in Galatians 4, 6-7,
[00:50:46.500 --> 00:50:48.500]   "Because you are sons, God has sent forth the spirit of sons
[00:50:48.500 --> 00:50:51.500]   into our hearts, crying, 'Abba, Father.'
[00:50:51.500 --> 00:50:53.500]   Therefore you are no longer slave, but a son,
[00:50:53.500 --> 00:50:57.500]   and if a son, then an heir through God."
[00:50:57.500 --> 00:50:59.500]   So the whole purpose of salvation
[00:50:59.500 --> 00:51:02.500]   is not simply so that we don't go to hell,
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:06.500]   but it's to reconcile us with the Holy Father,
[00:51:06.500 --> 00:51:11.500]   that we may ourselves address him as Abba Father.
[00:51:11.500 --> 00:51:13.500]   So you can say you know God,
[00:51:13.500 --> 00:51:15.500]   you can say that you believe God,
[00:51:15.500 --> 00:51:18.500]   but the whole purpose of salvation
[00:51:18.500 --> 00:51:21.500]   is to be able to say he is our Abba Father.
[00:51:21.500 --> 00:51:26.500]   Abba Father, a personal relationship with God.
[00:51:26.500 --> 00:51:28.500]   You may have heard before a cliche,
[00:51:28.500 --> 00:51:29.500]   "Christianity is not about a religion,
[00:51:29.500 --> 00:51:31.500]   it's about a relationship."
[00:51:31.500 --> 00:51:35.500]   Now some people have used that, and abused that,
[00:51:35.500 --> 00:51:39.500]   to use it in a way that benefits them,
[00:51:39.500 --> 00:51:44.500]   but at the core of the message, it's true.
[00:51:44.500 --> 00:51:46.500]   You can claim to know God,
[00:51:46.500 --> 00:51:47.500]   you can claim to worship God,
[00:51:47.500 --> 00:51:49.500]   you can claim to serve God,
[00:51:49.500 --> 00:51:51.500]   but you missed the whole point,
[00:51:51.500 --> 00:51:55.500]   if you do not understand if he is not your Abba Father.
[00:51:55.500 --> 00:51:57.500]   He's not the one that you run to for refuge,
[00:51:57.500 --> 00:52:03.500]   he's not the one that you run to when you are in danger,
[00:52:03.500 --> 00:52:06.500]   and when you are in need.
[00:52:06.500 --> 00:52:09.500]   You know what's interesting is this term Abba Father,
[00:52:09.500 --> 00:52:10.500]   like some people have said,
[00:52:10.500 --> 00:52:14.500]   "No, Abba means it's an intimate word, Daddy."
[00:52:14.500 --> 00:52:16.500]   Right, and so some people have said,
[00:52:16.500 --> 00:52:17.500]   "Well it means Daddy."
[00:52:17.500 --> 00:52:19.500]   And they're not necessarily completely wrong,
[00:52:19.500 --> 00:52:21.500]   but that's not exactly what it means.
[00:52:21.500 --> 00:52:26.500]   In fact, the word Abba is the Aramaic term
[00:52:26.500 --> 00:52:28.500]   for Dad, for Father.
[00:52:28.500 --> 00:52:31.500]   So it's no different than the next word, Father.
[00:52:31.500 --> 00:52:34.500]   So what's happening here, Abba Father,
[00:52:34.500 --> 00:52:40.500]   is using the former Hebrew and Aramaic term for Father,
[00:52:40.500 --> 00:52:43.500]   and then the word that's translated Father here,
[00:52:43.500 --> 00:52:45.500]   is a Greek term, pater.
[00:52:45.500 --> 00:52:51.500]   So what's happening here is that Paul
[00:52:51.500 --> 00:52:53.500]   is using the term Abba Father,
[00:52:53.500 --> 00:52:54.500]   and if you were to understand it,
[00:52:54.500 --> 00:52:56.500]   it would basically mean, and I'm going to use Korean
[00:52:56.500 --> 00:52:58.500]   because I know Korean better,
[00:52:58.500 --> 00:53:01.500]   it means Abba Father.
[00:53:01.500 --> 00:53:03.500]   It means the same thing.
[00:53:03.500 --> 00:53:06.500]   Abba Father basically means Father, Father.
[00:53:06.500 --> 00:53:09.500]   This is not ever translated Daddy,
[00:53:09.500 --> 00:53:11.500]   because that's not what this word means.
[00:53:11.500 --> 00:53:15.500]   It's just a general word for Father.
[00:53:15.500 --> 00:53:16.500]   Now why does he do that?
[00:53:16.500 --> 00:53:18.500]   What is the purpose of that?
[00:53:18.500 --> 00:53:20.500]   So if you were to read this in context,
[00:53:20.500 --> 00:53:22.500]   and if you understood the meaning of Abba Father,
[00:53:22.500 --> 00:53:24.500]   Father, Father, you know why certain things
[00:53:24.500 --> 00:53:26.500]   are repeated in the Bible, right?
[00:53:26.500 --> 00:53:29.500]   When Jesus wanted to say something very serious
[00:53:29.500 --> 00:53:30.500]   and needed Peter's attention,
[00:53:30.500 --> 00:53:33.500]   "Hey Peter, I know you have ADD, but pay attention.
[00:53:33.500 --> 00:53:36.500]   "Peter, Peter, I say to you, like pay attention."
[00:53:36.500 --> 00:53:38.500]   Or if he had something really important to say,
[00:53:38.500 --> 00:53:41.500]   "Truly, truly I say to you," and he repeated it twice.
[00:53:41.500 --> 00:53:43.500]   So a Jew would have understood
[00:53:43.500 --> 00:53:47.500]   to cry Abba Father was for the purpose of emphasis,
[00:53:47.500 --> 00:53:49.500]   that this is the point that he's trying to get at.
[00:53:49.500 --> 00:53:50.500]   He's not just simply saying,
[00:53:50.500 --> 00:53:52.500]   "He reconciled us to Abba Fa,"
[00:53:52.500 --> 00:53:53.500]   so we can call him Abba Father.
[00:53:53.500 --> 00:53:55.500]   He said, "He reconciled us so that we can call him
[00:53:55.500 --> 00:53:57.500]   "Abba Father, Father."
[00:53:57.500 --> 00:54:00.500]   The fatherhood of God in our lives
[00:54:00.500 --> 00:54:03.500]   is the reason for the gospel.
[00:54:03.500 --> 00:54:07.500]   That's the first reason why he uses the term Abba Father.
[00:54:07.500 --> 00:54:10.500]   The second term is related to why some people
[00:54:10.500 --> 00:54:14.500]   do translate this Daddy, because it's an intimate term.
[00:54:14.500 --> 00:54:16.500]   Not necessarily Daddy, right?
[00:54:16.500 --> 00:54:18.500]   Some people may use that,
[00:54:18.500 --> 00:54:21.500]   but it is a more personal, it is more intimate
[00:54:21.500 --> 00:54:24.500]   in the Aramaic.
[00:54:24.500 --> 00:54:29.500]   And so he's saying that he's not just talking about God,
[00:54:29.500 --> 00:54:31.500]   as in he's on his throne.
[00:54:31.500 --> 00:54:35.500]   He's talking about our dads, like personally.
[00:54:35.500 --> 00:54:39.500]   And so in the book of Hebrews,
[00:54:39.500 --> 00:54:43.500]   is that to bridge the gap between the Old Covenant
[00:54:43.500 --> 00:54:44.500]   and the New Covenant.
[00:54:44.500 --> 00:54:47.500]   Why did God do what he did in the Old Covenant,
[00:54:47.500 --> 00:54:49.500]   and what does that mean in the New Covenant?
[00:54:49.500 --> 00:54:51.500]   And so in the book of Hebrews,
[00:54:51.500 --> 00:54:55.500]   the whole emphasis is about bringing us to God,
[00:54:55.500 --> 00:54:57.500]   reconciling us to God.
[00:54:57.500 --> 00:54:59.500]   So Hebrews chapter 4, 15, it says,
[00:54:59.500 --> 00:55:01.500]   "Therefore let us draw near with confidence."
[00:55:01.500 --> 00:55:04.500]   Why did he have the sacrificial system?
[00:55:04.500 --> 00:55:07.500]   Why was there the priesthood of Melchizedek?
[00:55:07.500 --> 00:55:10.500]   Why was the tabernacle established?
[00:55:10.500 --> 00:55:11.500]   Why were the sacrifices?
[00:55:11.500 --> 00:55:15.500]   He said, "All of this is so that we may have confidence
[00:55:15.500 --> 00:55:19.500]   to draw near, that we may see him as our Abba Father."
[00:55:19.500 --> 00:55:21.500]   And this is repeated over and over again
[00:55:21.500 --> 00:55:24.500]   in the book of Hebrews, chapter 7, verse 19, 25.
[00:55:24.500 --> 00:55:27.500]   And then in Hebrews chapter 10, 19-22,
[00:55:27.500 --> 00:55:29.500]   "Therefore, brethren, since we have confidence
[00:55:29.500 --> 00:55:31.500]   to enter the holy place by the blood of Jesus,
[00:55:31.500 --> 00:55:34.500]   by a new and living way, which he inaugurated for us
[00:55:34.500 --> 00:55:36.500]   through the veil that is his flesh,
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:39.500]   and since we have a great priest over the house of God,
[00:55:39.500 --> 00:55:42.500]   let us draw near with a sincere heart
[00:55:42.500 --> 00:55:43.500]   and full assurance of faith,
[00:55:43.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   having our hearts sprinkled clean from an evil conscience
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:49.500]   and our bodies washed with pure water."
[00:55:49.500 --> 00:55:53.500]   So just to summarize, the whole point of the gospel
[00:55:53.500 --> 00:55:57.500]   is to reconcile us to our Abba Father.
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:01.500]   So if you worship him, you honor him, you believe him,
[00:56:01.500 --> 00:56:02.500]   but you don't go to him,
[00:56:02.500 --> 00:56:05.500]   you miss the whole point of salvation.
[00:56:05.500 --> 00:56:07.500]   The reason why the barrier was taken away
[00:56:07.500 --> 00:56:09.500]   is not so that we can come on Sunday
[00:56:09.500 --> 00:56:12.500]   and celebrate the barrier being gone.
[00:56:12.500 --> 00:56:14.500]   Look how much the barrier is gone.
[00:56:14.500 --> 00:56:17.500]   Look what Jesus did so that there's no barrier
[00:56:17.500 --> 00:56:18.500]   between us and God.
[00:56:18.500 --> 00:56:20.500]   Isn't God awesome?
[00:56:20.500 --> 00:56:22.500]   And to worship him and point to him
[00:56:22.500 --> 00:56:25.500]   and celebrate him from a distance.
[00:56:25.500 --> 00:56:28.500]   The whole point of the barrier being gone
[00:56:28.500 --> 00:56:31.500]   is so that we can get to him.
[00:56:31.500 --> 00:56:33.500]   So the whole book of Hebrews to reconcile
[00:56:33.500 --> 00:56:35.500]   what happened in the Old Testament to the New Testament
[00:56:35.500 --> 00:56:40.500]   is because of that, we are able to call him our Abba Father
[00:56:40.500 --> 00:56:43.500]   and draw near to him.
[00:56:43.500 --> 00:56:46.500]   So if you do not draw near, you miss the whole point.
[00:56:46.500 --> 00:56:51.500]   If all you do is celebrate and honor him from a distance.
[00:56:51.500 --> 00:56:54.500]   You know what's really interesting about all of this?
[00:56:54.500 --> 00:56:56.500]   And again, I think we all understand
[00:56:56.500 --> 00:56:59.500]   why some people say, "Oh, this is equivalent to daddy."
[00:56:59.500 --> 00:57:01.500]   I don't think it's equivalent to daddy,
[00:57:01.500 --> 00:57:04.500]   but there is some truth to that.
[00:57:04.500 --> 00:57:07.500]   But I remember when my children were younger,
[00:57:07.500 --> 00:57:09.500]   and some of you guys' older parents may relate,
[00:57:09.500 --> 00:57:12.500]   once they hit kind of like pre-teen, pre-puberty,
[00:57:12.500 --> 00:57:14.500]   all of a sudden they have to be cool,
[00:57:14.500 --> 00:57:17.500]   and they go from daddy to dad.
[00:57:17.500 --> 00:57:21.500]   And I remember my oldest son, when he was about fifth grade,
[00:57:21.500 --> 00:57:25.500]   he came home from school and one day he said, "Hey, dad."
[00:57:25.500 --> 00:57:27.500]   And I don't know why, that just hit me wrong.
[00:57:27.500 --> 00:57:29.500]   [laughter]
[00:57:29.500 --> 00:57:33.500]   Like, "Dad, I'm not your dad. I'm your daddy."
[00:57:33.500 --> 00:57:34.500]   [laughter]
[00:57:34.500 --> 00:57:36.500]   "I'm not ready to accept you as grown up.
[00:57:36.500 --> 00:57:39.500]   I want to hold on to you a little bit longer."
[00:57:39.500 --> 00:57:45.500]   So I asked him, like, "Not yet. You're not ready."
[00:57:45.500 --> 00:57:48.500]   Actually, it was more me. I'm not ready.
[00:57:48.500 --> 00:57:51.500]   So from that point on, he went back to calling me daddy,
[00:57:51.500 --> 00:57:54.500]   and then all the other siblings followed suit,
[00:57:54.500 --> 00:57:56.500]   and they started calling me daddy,
[00:57:56.500 --> 00:57:58.500]   and to this day they call me daddy.
[00:57:58.500 --> 00:58:01.500]   They whisper it when there's other people around.
[00:58:01.500 --> 00:58:03.500]   [laughter]
[00:58:03.500 --> 00:58:04.500]   And I prefer it.
[00:58:04.500 --> 00:58:08.500]   I prefer it because there's an intimacy, right?
[00:58:08.500 --> 00:58:11.500]   And again, I'm not saying that this is true in every family,
[00:58:11.500 --> 00:58:13.500]   but I know other families do the same, right?
[00:58:13.500 --> 00:58:16.500]   Because personally, I just don't want to be a figurehead.
[00:58:16.500 --> 00:58:18.500]   I want you to feel comfortable with it,
[00:58:18.500 --> 00:58:20.500]   like there's something personal with me, right?
[00:58:20.500 --> 00:58:24.500]   And the whole point of it is, again, the idea is
[00:58:24.500 --> 00:58:27.500]   to see him in an intimate sense,
[00:58:27.500 --> 00:58:30.500]   just like our brother Daniel was talking about,
[00:58:30.500 --> 00:58:33.500]   like just knowing that after all these years,
[00:58:33.500 --> 00:58:35.500]   God still loves him, God still cares for him,
[00:58:35.500 --> 00:58:37.500]   the doors are still open to him
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:40.500]   because he sees him as Abba Father.
[00:58:40.500 --> 00:58:43.500]   You know, every once in a while, I want to meet somebody,
[00:58:43.500 --> 00:58:46.500]   and I'll say, "Hey, can I meet in my office?"
[00:58:46.500 --> 00:58:48.500]   And for whatever the reason,
[00:58:48.500 --> 00:58:50.500]   whenever I ask somebody to come to my office,
[00:58:50.500 --> 00:58:53.500]   the first thing that they ask me is, "What did I do?"
[00:58:53.500 --> 00:58:56.500]   Right? "Am I in trouble?" Right?
[00:58:56.500 --> 00:58:59.500]   "No, no, no. That's just the easier place to meet."
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:01.500]   But my children have no problem.
[00:59:01.500 --> 00:59:03.500]   You know, sometimes I'll be walking in there,
[00:59:03.500 --> 00:59:05.500]   and I'll see one of my kids laid down taking a nap.
[00:59:05.500 --> 00:59:07.500]   Or they'll throw their books in there,
[00:59:07.500 --> 00:59:09.500]   and that's kind of like they're just keeping it there for a while.
[00:59:09.500 --> 00:59:12.500]   Right? They don't have any problem coming into my room
[00:59:12.500 --> 00:59:14.500]   because it's their daddy's room.
[00:59:14.500 --> 00:59:17.500]   And so the whole purpose of salvation is to
[00:59:17.500 --> 00:59:20.500]   see God as our personal father, our Abba Father.
[00:59:20.500 --> 00:59:22.500]   And that's the way he describes heaven.
[00:59:22.500 --> 00:59:25.500]   Heaven is not simply a place that's just nicer,
[00:59:25.500 --> 00:59:29.500]   cleaner, people are better behaved.
[00:59:29.500 --> 00:59:32.500]   Heaven is heaven because we're going home.
[00:59:32.500 --> 00:59:35.500]   That's our Father's place. That's how Jesus described it.
[00:59:35.500 --> 00:59:37.500]   In my Father's house, there's many rooms,
[00:59:37.500 --> 00:59:40.500]   and I go to prepare a room for you too.
[00:59:40.500 --> 00:59:43.500]   Heaven is heaven because we're going home.
[00:59:43.500 --> 00:59:46.500]   I know some of you guys who like to travel,
[00:59:46.500 --> 00:59:48.500]   but no matter how much you like to travel,
[00:59:48.500 --> 00:59:51.500]   you kind of hit a point where you want to go home.
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:53.500]   Because you want to sleep on your own bed.
[00:59:53.500 --> 00:59:55.500]   You want to go to your own bathroom.
[00:59:55.500 --> 00:59:57.500]   You want to wake up in your own house.
[00:59:57.500 --> 00:59:59.500]   Because that's where your home is.
[00:59:59.500 --> 01:00:02.500]   And so that's what he was trying to convey.
[01:00:02.500 --> 01:00:06.500]   That the old covenant Jews were following him
[01:00:06.500 --> 01:00:08.500]   and trying to obey him from a distance as a figurehead,
[01:00:08.500 --> 01:00:12.500]   but they did not know him as their Abba Father.
[01:00:12.500 --> 01:00:15.500]   And so Christ came to become a sympathetic high priest
[01:00:15.500 --> 01:00:19.500]   to draw us to himself.
[01:00:19.500 --> 01:00:21.500]   But there's another aspect of this Abba Father
[01:00:21.500 --> 01:00:23.500]   that's very interesting because
[01:00:23.500 --> 01:00:29.500]   the Hebrew word for father was Abba, not Abba.
[01:00:29.500 --> 01:00:36.500]   Abba was eventually kind of evolved into the Aramaic term.
[01:00:36.500 --> 01:00:39.500]   But in actual Hebrew in the Old Testament,
[01:00:39.500 --> 01:00:41.500]   the word Abba does not exist.
[01:00:41.500 --> 01:00:43.500]   It says A-B, Ab.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:46.500]   And what's interesting is the Hebrew alphabet
[01:00:46.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   has certain significance attached to it.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:51.500]   So Hebrew alphabet has numbers attached.
[01:00:51.500 --> 01:00:53.500]   That's why people get into numerology,
[01:00:53.500 --> 01:00:56.500]   they study the numbers in Hebrew vocabulary
[01:00:56.500 --> 01:00:58.500]   and how it connects to different things.
[01:00:58.500 --> 01:01:00.500]   But what's also interesting is each letter
[01:01:00.500 --> 01:01:03.500]   has images and meaning itself.
[01:01:03.500 --> 01:01:06.500]   And so if you look at the two images of these two words,
[01:01:06.500 --> 01:01:09.500]   Aleph and Beit, the first two letters of the Hebrew alphabet,
[01:01:09.500 --> 01:01:20.500]   if you can put up the picture, you guys have it.
[01:01:20.500 --> 01:01:22.500]   The next...
[01:01:22.500 --> 01:01:25.500]   Oh, what happened?
[01:01:25.500 --> 01:01:30.500]   Okay, so I'm just going to have to tell you, okay?
[01:01:30.500 --> 01:01:36.500]   The first letter, Aleph, right, is from Ab.
[01:01:36.500 --> 01:01:40.500]   The picture that is attached to it is a picture of an ox.
[01:01:40.500 --> 01:01:43.500]   And that picture of an ox represents strength.
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.500]   Or oftentimes it is seen as leadership.
[01:01:46.500 --> 01:01:49.500]   So the letter A itself has significance.
[01:01:49.500 --> 01:01:52.500]   The meaning is strength and leadership.
[01:01:52.500 --> 01:01:57.500]   The second word, Beit, like what we would pronounce B,
[01:01:57.500 --> 01:01:59.500]   the picture that they have that is attached to that word,
[01:01:59.500 --> 01:02:01.500]   if you look at the Hebrew dictionary,
[01:02:01.500 --> 01:02:06.500]   is the picture of a tent, and tent meaning the home.
[01:02:06.500 --> 01:02:08.500]   So when you put the two words together
[01:02:08.500 --> 01:02:11.500]   that is translated father in the Old Testament,
[01:02:11.500 --> 01:02:15.500]   it is a picture of a leader in the home.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:19.500]   So by the very nature of the word,
[01:02:19.500 --> 01:02:22.500]   it describes father as leader,
[01:02:22.500 --> 01:02:26.500]   the person who is strong in that home.
[01:02:26.500 --> 01:02:28.500]   So you didn't even have to study it.
[01:02:28.500 --> 01:02:30.500]   Any Jew would have been able to understand
[01:02:30.500 --> 01:02:32.500]   when they said father, he's talking about
[01:02:32.500 --> 01:02:36.500]   the strength of the home, the leader of the home.
[01:02:36.500 --> 01:02:38.500]   Now this is where I want to get into
[01:02:38.500 --> 01:02:40.500]   what does it mean to be a father in our generation?
[01:02:40.500 --> 01:02:44.500]   First, the idea comes from God, and then God gives it to us.
[01:02:44.500 --> 01:02:47.500]   Our understanding of what it means to be a father
[01:02:47.500 --> 01:02:49.500]   comes from God himself.
[01:02:49.500 --> 01:02:51.500]   Now these four things that I want to talk about
[01:02:51.500 --> 01:02:53.500]   for the rest of the time that we have
[01:02:53.500 --> 01:02:56.500]   is not directly taught, but is inferred
[01:02:56.500 --> 01:02:59.500]   as God uses it to describe fatherhood.
[01:02:59.500 --> 01:03:05.500]   First, fathers were given the responsibility
[01:03:05.500 --> 01:03:07.500]   of the education of their children.
[01:03:07.500 --> 01:03:09.500]   Fathers.
[01:03:09.500 --> 01:03:13.500]   When God gave the law to Moses and to be passed down,
[01:03:13.500 --> 01:03:18.500]   he intended that this education system of the law
[01:03:18.500 --> 01:03:22.500]   to be given from father to sons to children on and on.
[01:03:22.500 --> 01:03:24.500]   So fathers to fathers to fathers to fathers.
[01:03:24.500 --> 01:03:25.500]   And do you know what I mean?
[01:03:25.500 --> 01:03:29.500]   For 6, 617, 1119, on and on, he says the same thing.
[01:03:29.500 --> 01:03:32.500]   Only give heed to yourself and keep your soul diligently
[01:03:32.500 --> 01:03:34.500]   so that you do not forget the things
[01:03:34.500 --> 01:03:36.500]   which your eyes have seen,
[01:03:36.500 --> 01:03:38.500]   and they do not depart from your heart
[01:03:38.500 --> 01:03:39.500]   all the days of your life,
[01:03:39.500 --> 01:03:41.500]   but make them known to your sons and your grandsons.
[01:03:41.500 --> 01:03:45.500]   And this phrase is repeated over and over again.
[01:03:45.500 --> 01:03:50.500]   The modern-day school system was created in 1857
[01:03:50.500 --> 01:03:53.500]   during the Industrial Revolution
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:55.500]   that people were moving away from farms
[01:03:55.500 --> 01:03:57.500]   and they're going into the factories.
[01:03:57.500 --> 01:03:58.500]   So they were beginning to,
[01:03:58.500 --> 01:04:01.500]   parents were becoming more and more absent in the home.
[01:04:01.500 --> 01:04:02.500]   So as a result of that,
[01:04:02.500 --> 01:04:04.500]   they didn't know what to do with their children,
[01:04:04.500 --> 01:04:06.500]   so they came up with this corporate education
[01:04:06.500 --> 01:04:08.500]   where the children are sent off
[01:04:08.500 --> 01:04:10.500]   and the government would hire somebody
[01:04:10.500 --> 01:04:15.500]   to give corporate education.
[01:04:15.500 --> 01:04:19.500]   And that was, you know, in the last 150 years.
[01:04:19.500 --> 01:04:21.500]   But after about 150 years,
[01:04:21.500 --> 01:04:25.500]   it became the normal way that children are raised.
[01:04:25.500 --> 01:04:26.500]   That you have children
[01:04:26.500 --> 01:04:29.500]   and you send them off for their education
[01:04:29.500 --> 01:04:32.500]   and then for science and that kind of stuff
[01:04:32.500 --> 01:04:33.500]   to public schools,
[01:04:33.500 --> 01:04:37.500]   and then you send them to church for spiritual education,
[01:04:37.500 --> 01:04:39.500]   hoping that the church will do the job.
[01:04:39.500 --> 01:04:40.500]   That's why so many parents,
[01:04:40.500 --> 01:04:41.500]   when their children start going astray,
[01:04:41.500 --> 01:04:43.500]   they yell at the youth pastor.
[01:04:43.500 --> 01:04:44.500]   "You're not doing a good job.
[01:04:44.500 --> 01:04:46.500]   "My kids, you know, they don't respect me.
[01:04:46.500 --> 01:04:47.500]   "They're not listening.
[01:04:47.500 --> 01:04:50.500]   "And so you guys need to do a better job."
[01:04:50.500 --> 01:04:51.500]   That's a modern happening.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:53.500]   And I used to be a youth pastor
[01:04:53.500 --> 01:04:57.500]   and I was yelled at myself by parents.
[01:04:57.500 --> 01:04:58.500]   And I'm, you know,
[01:04:58.500 --> 01:04:59.500]   "What can I do?
[01:04:59.500 --> 01:05:00.500]   "Your kid's not showing up to church.
[01:05:00.500 --> 01:05:02.500]   "What can I do?"
[01:05:02.500 --> 01:05:05.500]   But only in the modern way of thinking,
[01:05:05.500 --> 01:05:08.500]   people say, "Well, you know, I had them and I feed them
[01:05:08.500 --> 01:05:11.500]   "and I make sure that they don't die, you know,
[01:05:11.500 --> 01:05:12.500]   "and I provide for them,"
[01:05:12.500 --> 01:05:16.500]   and the rest of it is sent out.
[01:05:16.500 --> 01:05:17.500]   From the get-go,
[01:05:17.500 --> 01:05:20.500]   God's intention of discipleship of children
[01:05:20.500 --> 01:05:22.500]   belonged to the father,
[01:05:22.500 --> 01:05:24.500]   not even the mother, but the father.
[01:05:24.500 --> 01:05:26.500]   In Deuteronomy 4, 9, it says,
[01:05:26.500 --> 01:05:28.500]   in Psalm 78, 5, 3, it says,
[01:05:28.500 --> 01:05:29.500]   "For he established a testimony in Jacob
[01:05:29.500 --> 01:05:31.500]   "and appointed a law in Israel,
[01:05:31.500 --> 01:05:33.500]   "which he commanded our fathers
[01:05:33.500 --> 01:05:36.500]   "that they should teach them to their children,
[01:05:36.500 --> 01:05:38.500]   "that the generation to come might know,
[01:05:38.500 --> 01:05:40.500]   "even the children yet to be born,
[01:05:40.500 --> 01:05:43.500]   "that they may arise and tell them to their children,
[01:05:43.500 --> 01:05:46.500]   "that they should put their confidence in God
[01:05:46.500 --> 01:05:47.500]   "and not forget the works of God,
[01:05:47.500 --> 01:05:49.500]   "but keep his commandments
[01:05:49.500 --> 01:05:51.500]   "and not be like their fathers,
[01:05:51.500 --> 01:05:53.500]   "a stubborn and rebellious generation,
[01:05:53.500 --> 01:05:55.500]   "a generation that did not prepare its heart
[01:05:55.500 --> 01:06:00.500]   "and whose spirit was not faithful to God."
[01:06:00.500 --> 01:06:01.500]   You notice here in verse 8,
[01:06:01.500 --> 01:06:03.500]   it says the reason why they're going astray
[01:06:03.500 --> 01:06:06.500]   is because the previous fathers did not do their job.
[01:06:06.500 --> 01:06:08.500]   That's what he says.
[01:06:08.500 --> 01:06:10.500]   The reason why they're rebelling,
[01:06:10.500 --> 01:06:13.500]   reason why their hearts have not been prepared
[01:06:13.500 --> 01:06:15.500]   to be faithful to God
[01:06:15.500 --> 01:06:17.500]   is because the previous fathers
[01:06:17.500 --> 01:06:20.500]   did not take the responsibility.
[01:06:20.500 --> 01:06:22.500]   He said the education of the children
[01:06:22.500 --> 01:06:24.500]   was placed upon the father, the leader,
[01:06:24.500 --> 01:06:28.500]   the strength of the home, first and foremost,
[01:06:28.500 --> 01:06:31.500]   that we are not to dish this out to others.
[01:06:31.500 --> 01:06:33.500]   I want to make this clear.
[01:06:33.500 --> 01:06:36.500]   Does the Bible say that, therefore,
[01:06:36.500 --> 01:06:38.500]   that you can't send them to public school
[01:06:38.500 --> 01:06:40.500]   or you have to send them to the--
[01:06:40.500 --> 01:06:42.500]   all kids need to be homeschooled?
[01:06:42.500 --> 01:06:45.500]   There's no such teaching in the Bible.
[01:06:45.500 --> 01:06:48.500]   But principally,
[01:06:48.500 --> 01:06:50.500]   whichever path that you choose to take,
[01:06:50.500 --> 01:06:52.500]   that responsibility is not at school.
[01:06:52.500 --> 01:06:54.500]   That responsibility is not at church.
[01:06:54.500 --> 01:06:56.500]   It's on the fathers.
[01:06:56.500 --> 01:06:58.500]   That's what God intended.
[01:06:58.500 --> 01:07:00.500]   And whichever path you take,
[01:07:00.500 --> 01:07:04.500]   it must be so that it's the best way to educate them,
[01:07:04.500 --> 01:07:06.500]   best way to disciple them,
[01:07:06.500 --> 01:07:08.500]   may be that path.
[01:07:08.500 --> 01:07:11.500]   But that responsibility was given to us as fathers.
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.500]   In Joshua 24, 15,
[01:07:13.500 --> 01:07:16.500]   as a nation of Israel are going astray,
[01:07:16.500 --> 01:07:21.500]   and Joshua makes a stand at the end of his life.
[01:07:21.500 --> 01:07:23.500]   And he's challenging the nation of Israel
[01:07:23.500 --> 01:07:25.500]   because they keep going back to idols
[01:07:25.500 --> 01:07:27.500]   and then back to God.
[01:07:27.500 --> 01:07:28.500]   And this is what it says.
[01:07:28.500 --> 01:07:30.500]   "If it is disagreeable in your sight to serve the Lord,
[01:07:30.500 --> 01:07:33.500]   "choose for yourself to say whom you will serve,
[01:07:33.500 --> 01:07:35.500]   "whether the gods which your father served,
[01:07:35.500 --> 01:07:37.500]   "which were beyond the river,
[01:07:37.500 --> 01:07:39.500]   "or the gods of the Amorites in whose land you are living.
[01:07:39.500 --> 01:07:43.500]   "But as for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
[01:07:43.500 --> 01:07:45.500]   You notice here,
[01:07:45.500 --> 01:07:48.500]   he addresses the problem of the nation of Israel.
[01:07:48.500 --> 01:07:50.500]   And the way he addresses it,
[01:07:50.500 --> 01:07:53.500]   he says, "For me and my house, we'll serve the Lord."
[01:07:53.500 --> 01:07:55.500]   He doesn't say, "We need to reform the temple.
[01:07:55.500 --> 01:07:57.500]   "We need to reform our education system.
[01:07:57.500 --> 01:08:00.500]   "We need to reform the businesses."
[01:08:00.500 --> 01:08:04.500]   He says, "No, for me and my house, we will serve the Lord."
[01:08:04.500 --> 01:08:07.500]   He starts at his home, and he challenges them,
[01:08:07.500 --> 01:08:09.500]   challenges other fathers.
[01:08:09.500 --> 01:08:12.500]   "Where are you going to stand?
[01:08:12.500 --> 01:08:14.500]   "Are you going to follow the pattern of this world
[01:08:14.500 --> 01:08:16.500]   "and go back and forth wherever it's more convenient
[01:08:16.500 --> 01:08:19.500]   "to follow idols, or will you make a stand?
[01:08:19.500 --> 01:08:23.500]   "For me and my household, we will serve the Lord."
[01:08:23.500 --> 01:08:25.500]   The discipleship of our children
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:29.500]   are on the shoulders of the fathers to take care of them.
[01:08:29.500 --> 01:08:34.500]   We cannot dish this out, this responsibility out.
[01:08:34.500 --> 01:08:37.500]   I remember years ago when Billy Graham
[01:08:37.500 --> 01:08:39.500]   was at the beginning of his Parkinson's disease,
[01:08:39.500 --> 01:08:42.500]   and so they thought his ministry was going to be over.
[01:08:42.500 --> 01:08:44.500]   So sometime in the 1990s,
[01:08:44.500 --> 01:08:46.500]   Time Magazine had an interview with him
[01:08:46.500 --> 01:08:49.500]   asking him, "After all these years of ministry,
[01:08:49.500 --> 01:08:51.500]   "if you were to go back, what would you do differently?"
[01:08:51.500 --> 01:08:53.500]   And I remember hearing what he said
[01:08:53.500 --> 01:08:55.500]   made such a huge impact on me.
[01:08:55.500 --> 01:08:58.500]   And they said, "This is a man who most likely
[01:08:58.500 --> 01:09:00.500]   "were able to preach the gospel to more people
[01:09:00.500 --> 01:09:02.500]   "than any person who has ever lived."
[01:09:02.500 --> 01:09:04.500]   I know that at the tail end of his life,
[01:09:04.500 --> 01:09:06.500]   there was some controversy in his ministry,
[01:09:06.500 --> 01:09:11.500]   but at that time, at least pure number-wise,
[01:09:11.500 --> 01:09:13.500]   because of technology and his traveling,
[01:09:13.500 --> 01:09:16.500]   that for millions of people who preached the gospel,
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:20.500]   even my own mother came to Christ through his crusades.
[01:09:20.500 --> 01:09:23.500]   And they asked him, "If you were to do it over,
[01:09:23.500 --> 01:09:25.500]   "what would you do over again?"
[01:09:25.500 --> 01:09:26.500]   And he said these two things.
[01:09:26.500 --> 01:09:28.500]   He said, "I would have studied more,
[01:09:28.500 --> 01:09:30.500]   "and I would have traveled less."
[01:09:30.500 --> 01:09:31.500]   That's what he said.
[01:09:31.500 --> 01:09:33.500]   He's a man who was able to preach the gospel
[01:09:33.500 --> 01:09:35.500]   because he traveled,
[01:09:35.500 --> 01:09:37.500]   because he dedicated his life to evangelism.
[01:09:37.500 --> 01:09:39.500]   But he said, "I would have studied more,
[01:09:39.500 --> 01:09:41.500]   "stayed put and studied more,
[01:09:41.500 --> 01:09:42.500]   "and I would have traveled less."
[01:09:42.500 --> 01:09:44.500]   So obviously, the interviewer asked him further questions,
[01:09:44.500 --> 01:09:46.500]   like, "What do you mean by that, travel less?"
[01:09:46.500 --> 01:09:49.500]   He said, "I spent so much time focused
[01:09:49.500 --> 01:09:51.500]   "outside what's going on
[01:09:51.500 --> 01:09:55.500]   "that I didn't spend enough priority on my own children."
[01:09:55.500 --> 01:09:58.500]   And he said, "Of all the things that he would do over again,"
[01:09:58.500 --> 01:10:00.500]   he said, "I would do that again.
[01:10:00.500 --> 01:10:03.500]   "I would make sure that I traveled less
[01:10:03.500 --> 01:10:06.500]   "and then studied more."
[01:10:06.500 --> 01:10:12.500]   We are called to disciple our children, the fathers.
[01:10:12.500 --> 01:10:15.500]   You don't dish that out simply to mothers,
[01:10:15.500 --> 01:10:18.500]   to school systems, to other places.
[01:10:18.500 --> 01:10:20.500]   We're responsible for that as fathers.
[01:10:20.500 --> 01:10:23.500]   Secondly, the fathers are responsible
[01:10:23.500 --> 01:10:25.500]   for the discipline in the home.
[01:10:25.500 --> 01:10:27.500]   The fathers are.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:32.500]   You can't simply say, "I don't like being that guy,
[01:10:32.500 --> 01:10:34.500]   "so I'm going to let the mom be the bad cop,
[01:10:34.500 --> 01:10:36.500]   "and I'm going to be the good cop."
[01:10:36.500 --> 01:10:38.500]   Whoever brings the final discipline at home
[01:10:38.500 --> 01:10:42.500]   is probably the one who is leading that home.
[01:10:42.500 --> 01:10:44.500]   I remember years ago,
[01:10:44.500 --> 01:10:47.500]   I was meeting up with local church missionaries
[01:10:47.500 --> 01:10:48.500]   that the cult--
[01:10:48.500 --> 01:10:50.500]   some of you guys may be familiar with them,
[01:10:50.500 --> 01:10:52.500]   but I was meeting up with them.
[01:10:52.500 --> 01:10:54.500]   One of the foundations of their teaching is
[01:10:54.500 --> 01:10:56.500]   they don't have leaders.
[01:10:56.500 --> 01:10:58.500]   We believe in the priesthood of believers.
[01:10:58.500 --> 01:11:00.500]   We don't have pastors.
[01:11:00.500 --> 01:11:02.500]   Everybody would study, and they would come back,
[01:11:02.500 --> 01:11:04.500]   and they would share with each other.
[01:11:04.500 --> 01:11:05.500]   We don't have leaders.
[01:11:05.500 --> 01:11:07.500]   You guys are unbiblical because you have pastors
[01:11:07.500 --> 01:11:09.500]   and elders and leaders, even though the Bible says so.
[01:11:09.500 --> 01:11:11.500]   But they said, "We don't believe.
[01:11:11.500 --> 01:11:12.500]   "We don't have any leaders."
[01:11:12.500 --> 01:11:14.500]   I asked them, "If somebody comes into your church,
[01:11:14.500 --> 01:11:16.500]   "and they begin to open the Bible,
[01:11:16.500 --> 01:11:18.500]   "and they start saying things that are contrary
[01:11:18.500 --> 01:11:21.500]   "to what you guys believe, what do you guys do?"
[01:11:21.500 --> 01:11:23.500]   And he said, "Well, we have people.
[01:11:23.500 --> 01:11:25.500]   "I'll stand up and pull them aside,
[01:11:25.500 --> 01:11:27.500]   "and we'll make sure that they don't repeat that
[01:11:27.500 --> 01:11:29.500]   "in the church."
[01:11:29.500 --> 01:11:31.500]   And I said, "So you have somebody designated
[01:11:31.500 --> 01:11:34.500]   "that when false doctrines, like according to you,
[01:11:34.500 --> 01:11:36.500]   "is being spread in that church,
[01:11:36.500 --> 01:11:38.500]   "they'll stand up and say you are not allowed to do that
[01:11:38.500 --> 01:11:39.500]   "and kick them out of the church?"
[01:11:39.500 --> 01:11:40.500]   And he says, "Yes."
[01:11:40.500 --> 01:11:43.500]   They're your leaders.
[01:11:43.500 --> 01:11:45.500]   Those people that you've designated
[01:11:45.500 --> 01:11:47.500]   in your church to make sure that false doctrines
[01:11:47.500 --> 01:11:49.500]   are coming in, they're your leaders.
[01:11:49.500 --> 01:11:51.500]   You can call them whatever you want,
[01:11:51.500 --> 01:11:53.500]   but the one who brings the discipline
[01:11:53.500 --> 01:11:58.500]   is the one who is leading that home.
[01:11:58.500 --> 01:12:00.500]   In Proverbs 3, 11-12, it says,
[01:12:00.500 --> 01:12:03.500]   "My son, do not reject this discipline of the Lord
[01:12:03.500 --> 01:12:05.500]   "or loathe his reproof.
[01:12:05.500 --> 01:12:07.500]   "For whom the Lord loves, he reproves,
[01:12:07.500 --> 01:12:09.500]   "even as Father corrects the son in whom he delights."
[01:12:09.500 --> 01:12:11.500]   He doesn't say, "Fathers, you have to discipline."
[01:12:11.500 --> 01:12:13.500]   But he assumes that.
[01:12:13.500 --> 01:12:17.500]   Hebrews 12, 7, "It is for discipline that you endure.
[01:12:17.500 --> 01:12:19.500]   "God deals with you as with sons.
[01:12:19.500 --> 01:12:23.500]   "For what son is there whom his father does not discipline?"
[01:12:23.500 --> 01:12:25.500]   It's given.
[01:12:25.500 --> 01:12:27.500]   That's the role of the father.
[01:12:27.500 --> 01:12:29.500]   Colossians 3, 21, "Fathers, do not exasperate your children
[01:12:29.500 --> 01:12:32.500]   "so that they will not lose heart."
[01:12:32.500 --> 01:12:36.500]   In your discipline, make sure that you are tempered,
[01:12:36.500 --> 01:12:39.500]   that you're not just giving full vent to your anger,
[01:12:39.500 --> 01:12:41.500]   but it's given, that that responsibility
[01:12:41.500 --> 01:12:43.500]   has given to the father.
[01:12:43.500 --> 01:12:48.500]   Thirdly, fathers are the providers of the family.
[01:12:48.500 --> 01:12:51.500]   Fathers are the providers of the family.
[01:12:51.500 --> 01:12:53.500]   Now, again, let me repeat.
[01:12:53.500 --> 01:12:56.500]   This doesn't mean the Bible says that women can't work
[01:12:56.500 --> 01:12:58.500]   and you can't do this, you can't do that,
[01:12:58.500 --> 01:13:00.500]   that if you're going to follow Jesus Christ,
[01:13:00.500 --> 01:13:02.500]   you need to stay home and you can't have a job.
[01:13:02.500 --> 01:13:04.500]   The Bible does not describe that.
[01:13:04.500 --> 01:13:07.500]   But the Bible does describe that responsibility
[01:13:07.500 --> 01:13:11.500]   is on the shoulder of the man of that house.
[01:13:11.500 --> 01:13:14.500]   In 1 Timothy 5, 7, "But if anyone does not provide for his own,
[01:13:14.500 --> 01:13:17.500]   "and especially for those of his own household,
[01:13:17.500 --> 01:13:20.500]   "he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever."
[01:13:20.500 --> 01:13:22.500]   He's talking to men.
[01:13:22.500 --> 01:13:24.500]   He's talking to men.
[01:13:24.500 --> 01:13:26.500]   That responsibility is on the shoulders of the men.
[01:13:26.500 --> 01:13:29.500]   Matthew 7, 9-11, even the way he describes prayer.
[01:13:29.500 --> 01:13:33.500]   "Or what man is there among you who, when his son asks for love,
[01:13:33.500 --> 01:13:35.500]   "will give him a stone?
[01:13:35.500 --> 01:13:38.500]   "If he asks for a fish, he will not give him a snake, will he?
[01:13:38.500 --> 01:13:42.500]   "If you, then, being evil, know how to give good gifts to your children,
[01:13:42.500 --> 01:13:44.500]   "how much more will your Father who is in heaven
[01:13:44.500 --> 01:13:47.500]   "give what is good to those who ask him?"
[01:13:47.500 --> 01:13:53.500]   This is such a difficult thing in our generation
[01:13:53.500 --> 01:13:59.500]   because the understanding of fatherhood has been so watered down.
[01:13:59.500 --> 01:14:07.500]   It almost seems sinful to say, "Be a man and do this."
[01:14:07.500 --> 01:14:11.500]   Now, many of us, especially those of you who are older,
[01:14:11.500 --> 01:14:14.500]   came from immigrant families.
[01:14:14.500 --> 01:14:16.500]   And because we came from immigrant families,
[01:14:16.500 --> 01:14:18.500]   our fathers were not able to make enough money,
[01:14:18.500 --> 01:14:20.500]   so many of us, we're called latchkey kids
[01:14:20.500 --> 01:14:22.500]   because our parents were not around.
[01:14:22.500 --> 01:14:24.500]   And they were put into that situation
[01:14:24.500 --> 01:14:27.500]   because that was the only way for them to survive.
[01:14:27.500 --> 01:14:30.500]   And so they had to do what they needed to do.
[01:14:30.500 --> 01:14:32.500]   So the Bible is not prescribing and saying,
[01:14:32.500 --> 01:14:35.500]   "This is the only way that you're going to take care of your family."
[01:14:35.500 --> 01:14:39.500]   But at the same time, the Bible makes it very clear
[01:14:39.500 --> 01:14:43.500]   that responsibility, that weight is on our shoulders.
[01:14:43.500 --> 01:14:46.500]   You know, I see in our generation more and more people
[01:14:46.500 --> 01:14:49.500]   because they want to live a certain lifestyle,
[01:14:49.500 --> 01:14:54.500]   which was a term created by rich people.
[01:14:54.500 --> 01:14:56.500]   Lifestyle, style.
[01:14:56.500 --> 01:14:57.500]   You're going to have a style,
[01:14:57.500 --> 01:15:00.500]   a certain style of life you're going to have, right?
[01:15:00.500 --> 01:15:01.500]   Completely unbiblical.
[01:15:01.500 --> 01:15:05.500]   Either you are living or you are dead.
[01:15:05.500 --> 01:15:09.500]   But the idea of lifestyle is certain things that are added to your life.
[01:15:09.500 --> 01:15:10.500]   I'm going to live by this style.
[01:15:10.500 --> 01:15:12.500]   I'm going to live by this standard.
[01:15:12.500 --> 01:15:16.500]   And so in order to have this lifestyle,
[01:15:16.500 --> 01:15:19.500]   I need to do this and this and this and this.
[01:15:19.500 --> 01:15:25.500]   And oftentimes, who we end up forfeiting is our own children
[01:15:25.500 --> 01:15:28.500]   to have a certain lifestyle.
[01:15:28.500 --> 01:15:33.500]   I remember early on--and again, I never went to father's school.
[01:15:33.500 --> 01:15:40.500]   I come from an immigrant family where my parents were busy with ministry.
[01:15:40.500 --> 01:15:43.500]   So my parents were not around much.
[01:15:43.500 --> 01:15:48.500]   So I remember the first time I became a father, I was scared to death
[01:15:48.500 --> 01:15:51.500]   because they gave me a baby that's life.
[01:15:51.500 --> 01:15:55.500]   And I remember thinking, like, I break everything.
[01:15:55.500 --> 01:15:59.500]   My dad would always say, like, "Peter, you're too rough."
[01:15:59.500 --> 01:16:02.500]   And anything that's in my hand, eventually--I'm just curious.
[01:16:02.500 --> 01:16:04.500]   I want to break it apart and see what's inside.
[01:16:04.500 --> 01:16:07.500]   Or sometimes I play with it too rough and it would break.
[01:16:07.500 --> 01:16:10.500]   And I remember they would give me my firstborn,
[01:16:10.500 --> 01:16:16.500]   and I remember taking him home thinking, "Oh, my God, I'm going to break him too."
[01:16:16.500 --> 01:16:20.500]   Are they serious? Do they know who I am?
[01:16:20.500 --> 01:16:26.500]   I remember early on thinking, "I'm going to be the best father that I know how to be,"
[01:16:26.500 --> 01:16:28.500]   which I did not know.
[01:16:28.500 --> 01:16:30.500]   I didn't know what that meant, but I want to try.
[01:16:30.500 --> 01:16:35.500]   So I remember early on--and some of you guys who know, I just don't spend money.
[01:16:35.500 --> 01:16:38.500]   I don't have habits where I have to go buy stuff.
[01:16:38.500 --> 01:16:43.500]   But I spent $800 on Hanna-Barbera Bible stories.
[01:16:43.500 --> 01:16:45.500]   $800 for me.
[01:16:45.500 --> 01:16:47.500]   My full-time pay at that time was $1,300.
[01:16:47.500 --> 01:16:50.500]   $800 was a lot of money.
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:54.500]   But I bought it because I wanted to make sure that I prepare so my children,
[01:16:54.500 --> 01:16:57.500]   when they're old enough--and this is right after we got married.
[01:16:57.500 --> 01:16:59.500]   I didn't even have kids yet.
[01:16:59.500 --> 01:17:02.500]   So I bought that, and it was on our shelf.
[01:17:02.500 --> 01:17:06.500]   And by the time my kids were old enough to watch it, it became lame already.
[01:17:06.500 --> 01:17:12.500]   So all this computer stuff came out, and Hanna-Barbera--it felt like it was 20, 30 years old.
[01:17:12.500 --> 01:17:14.500]   So more than half of it we never even opened.
[01:17:14.500 --> 01:17:16.500]   I ended up just donating it to somebody.
[01:17:16.500 --> 01:17:18.500]   But I was determined.
[01:17:18.500 --> 01:17:19.500]   I'm going to be a good father.
[01:17:19.500 --> 01:17:23.500]   I didn't know what that meant, but I want to be a good father.
[01:17:23.500 --> 01:17:29.500]   Early on, because we were having financial problems, my wife was working,
[01:17:29.500 --> 01:17:37.500]   and we had Jeremy at daycare because I had to do ministry, and then Esther had to work.
[01:17:37.500 --> 01:17:43.500]   But early on, before she went in, I asked her because she got accepted to a pharmacy school,
[01:17:43.500 --> 01:17:45.500]   and I asked her to change her major.
[01:17:45.500 --> 01:17:49.500]   And the reason why--because I wanted her to run with me.
[01:17:49.500 --> 01:17:53.500]   So at that time, I was speaking in a lot of churches, and during the summertime,
[01:17:53.500 --> 01:17:57.500]   we would go to retreats, and so if you have that job, you're not going to be able to come.
[01:17:57.500 --> 01:18:01.500]   So maybe if you became a schoolteacher, that you would have summer breaks,
[01:18:01.500 --> 01:18:04.500]   and then you'll be a little bit more flexible, and you can come with me.
[01:18:04.500 --> 01:18:05.500]   That was one reason.
[01:18:05.500 --> 01:18:10.500]   But the second reason was because I was making so little money, if she became a pharmacist,
[01:18:10.500 --> 01:18:14.500]   she would be making four times what I was making at that time, and I was afraid.
[01:18:14.500 --> 01:18:20.500]   I was afraid that if she makes that kind of money, and I am making four times less,
[01:18:20.500 --> 01:18:26.500]   and we get used to that lifestyle, that if we ever wanted to ask her to stay home,
[01:18:26.500 --> 01:18:28.500]   I'm not going to be able to.
[01:18:28.500 --> 01:18:33.500]   How are we going to go from making what she's making, being used to having that kind of money,
[01:18:33.500 --> 01:18:37.500]   and then all of a sudden, we're going to get rid of two-thirds of our income,
[01:18:37.500 --> 01:18:39.500]   and then we're going to live here?
[01:18:39.500 --> 01:18:45.500]   So from the get-go, in order to prevent that temptation, I asked her not to go into that field.
[01:18:45.500 --> 01:18:53.500]   Eventually, even though as a schoolteacher, she was still making double what I was making as a schoolteacher,
[01:18:53.500 --> 01:18:57.500]   eventually I asked her to stay home, and the reason why I asked her to stay home was
[01:18:57.500 --> 01:19:02.500]   Jeremy was going to daycare and coming back sick all the time,
[01:19:02.500 --> 01:19:04.500]   and I'm tired after doing ministry.
[01:19:04.500 --> 01:19:11.500]   She's tired, and from four or five o'clock until he slept, there was just no peace at home.
[01:19:11.500 --> 01:19:16.500]   And so I remember, and again, this is not because I was convicted about, you know, you can't work or any of that.
[01:19:16.500 --> 01:19:24.500]   It was just practically that there's no peace at home because my kids are going to be like constantly,
[01:19:24.500 --> 01:19:26.500]   and they're away from us, and when they are together,
[01:19:26.500 --> 01:19:30.500]   we don't want to use that three, four hours with them to discipline them,
[01:19:30.500 --> 01:19:32.500]   and then send them back to school the next day.
[01:19:32.500 --> 01:19:38.500]   So it was more of a practical decision that even though I'm going to be losing my health coverage and all that stuff,
[01:19:38.500 --> 01:19:43.500]   I'd rather have peace at home, and I'm going to, even if I have to get a second job,
[01:19:43.500 --> 01:19:48.500]   I'd rather get a second job, and I'm huffing and puffing, but at least my kids and my wife will be taken care of,
[01:19:48.500 --> 01:19:50.500]   and they'll be there with peace at home.
[01:19:50.500 --> 01:19:53.500]   So practical reason.
[01:19:53.500 --> 01:19:58.500]   As difficult as that was, it was the best decision that I made.
[01:19:58.500 --> 01:20:01.500]   As difficult as that, and yes, we had financial problems.
[01:20:01.500 --> 01:20:02.500]   It was difficult.
[01:20:02.500 --> 01:20:06.500]   There were periods when I couldn't even ask her to go buy grocery.
[01:20:06.500 --> 01:20:11.500]   Now, I share all of this, not because I did everything perfectly,
[01:20:11.500 --> 01:20:22.500]   but this temptation to live a certain lifestyle, this lifestyle that we have planted ourselves in,
[01:20:22.500 --> 01:20:25.500]   that we will not compromise in.
[01:20:25.500 --> 01:20:32.500]   If there's anything that you should not compromise is your children, not your lifestyle.
[01:20:32.500 --> 01:20:36.500]   So again, I'm not saying that there's a certain path that everybody needs to go to,
[01:20:36.500 --> 01:20:42.500]   but that responsibility for the husband, for the father, it's on our shoulders.
[01:20:42.500 --> 01:20:46.500]   We don't share that burden with our wives.
[01:20:46.500 --> 01:20:51.500]   We don't come home and say, "You know what? It's too hard for me, so you should do it too."
[01:20:51.500 --> 01:20:58.500]   Now, you may be in a situation where that may be necessary, but that responsibility is on us.
[01:20:58.500 --> 01:21:01.500]   It's on us to take care of our home.
[01:21:01.500 --> 01:21:10.500]   And so the responsibility of the father is to create a place where the wife can be the best wife that she can be,
[01:21:10.500 --> 01:21:13.500]   so that she can be the best mother that she can be.
[01:21:13.500 --> 01:21:19.500]   That responsibility is on the shoulder of the father.
[01:21:19.500 --> 01:21:27.500]   I know that's difficult, and I have not done a perfect job in that myself.
[01:21:27.500 --> 01:21:34.500]   But today, as men are being deliberately neutered in our culture,
[01:21:34.500 --> 01:21:40.500]   if there's any time in history where men need to act like men, it's today.
[01:21:40.500 --> 01:21:47.500]   We need to take responsibility of our own homes and shoulder that ourselves.
[01:21:47.500 --> 01:21:55.500]   Again, early on, when we didn't have a lot of money, ESSER did a far greater job balancing our checkbooks.
[01:21:55.500 --> 01:21:58.500]   Some of you guys have no idea what that means.
[01:21:58.500 --> 01:22:03.500]   A long time ago, before computer, we had to wait for the bank statement to come,
[01:22:03.500 --> 01:22:10.500]   and then you'd keep record of what you spent, and then you would reconcile with what the bank says that you spent.
[01:22:10.500 --> 01:22:13.500]   And so once a month, you would have to take the bank statement and reconcile it.
[01:22:13.500 --> 01:22:16.500]   Now, I am not good with details.
[01:22:16.500 --> 01:22:20.500]   So whenever I do it, it just never comes out the way it should.
[01:22:20.500 --> 01:22:26.500]   I'm always missing two, three hundred bucks, or next time I do it, it's like, "Oh, we're rich."
[01:22:26.500 --> 01:22:30.500]   Not because we really are, because I'm just not good at keeping records.
[01:22:30.500 --> 01:22:31.500]   So ESSER was good at that.
[01:22:31.500 --> 01:22:37.500]   But there was a stretch in our early days in marriage where I wasn't getting paid from church,
[01:22:37.500 --> 01:22:39.500]   because the church was having a struggle.
[01:22:39.500 --> 01:22:42.500]   And I'm not talking about this church, but the previous church I was at.
[01:22:42.500 --> 01:22:48.500]   So there were stretches, and I remember one year, there was about four or five months that I didn't get paid at all, zero.
[01:22:48.500 --> 01:22:51.500]   So I was going out washing cars and doing whatever I needed to to pay bills,
[01:22:51.500 --> 01:22:58.500]   but I remember coming home one day, and ESSER was sitting on the bed crying because she was so anxious that we didn't have money.
[01:22:58.500 --> 01:23:03.500]   And so I came and I saw her a couple times, and after that I said, "You know what?
[01:23:03.500 --> 01:23:05.500]   This is not your responsibility."
[01:23:05.500 --> 01:23:10.500]   So I took that away from her, even though I knew I'm going to be losing some money, you know what I mean?
[01:23:10.500 --> 01:23:12.500]   Because I'm not good at keeping records.
[01:23:12.500 --> 01:23:18.500]   But when that pressure of finance comes, I need to take that responsibility.
[01:23:18.500 --> 01:23:21.500]   I don't want her to think, "I've got to get another job. I've got to go do this."
[01:23:21.500 --> 01:23:23.500]   I need to do that.
[01:23:23.500 --> 01:23:27.500]   So I took that on so that when I felt like that we're going to be short of money,
[01:23:27.500 --> 01:23:31.500]   so that I can go pass out flyers and wash cars and cut grass, whatever I needed to do,
[01:23:31.500 --> 01:23:37.500]   so that she can be home and give full attention to our family.
[01:23:37.500 --> 01:23:41.500]   That responsibility is on my shoulder.
[01:23:41.500 --> 01:23:44.500]   It is on your shoulder as men.
[01:23:44.500 --> 01:23:48.500]   Again, I'm going to say, because I know somebody in this room is going to say,
[01:23:48.500 --> 01:23:52.500]   "Oh, this guy's legalistic. He's telling us that women need to stay home barefoot and pregnant."
[01:23:52.500 --> 01:23:55.500]   I'm not saying that. I never said that.
[01:23:55.500 --> 01:24:02.500]   What I am saying, principally, that's the men's responsibility.
[01:24:02.500 --> 01:24:06.500]   That the pressure is put on men.
[01:24:06.500 --> 01:24:12.500]   That if the men don't take that responsibility, we're not leaders.
[01:24:12.500 --> 01:24:14.500]   We're not leaders.
[01:24:14.500 --> 01:24:19.500]   You can't be a leader simply because the Bible says that God's given you this title.
[01:24:19.500 --> 01:24:23.500]   You're a leader because you're leading, because you're up in the front.
[01:24:23.500 --> 01:24:25.500]   You're the one taking the bullets.
[01:24:25.500 --> 01:24:30.500]   You're the one who is willing to go out and get your hands dirty, stay up late, get the second job,
[01:24:30.500 --> 01:24:32.500]   and coming home huffing and puffing.
[01:24:32.500 --> 01:24:36.500]   We live in a culture where you're taught since you're young, "Follow your dreams."
[01:24:36.500 --> 01:24:38.500]   That's bogus.
[01:24:38.500 --> 01:24:43.500]   "Follow your dreams" is just another way of saying, "Give into your flesh."
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:46.500]   Whatever your flesh desires, follow it.
[01:24:46.500 --> 01:24:48.500]   That's not Christian.
[01:24:48.500 --> 01:24:54.500]   For men, we don't look for careers that make me feel happy.
[01:24:54.500 --> 01:25:00.500]   We choose careers that are going to help me to take care of my family.
[01:25:00.500 --> 01:25:02.500]   Not what fulfills me.
[01:25:02.500 --> 01:25:05.500]   What fulfills me is to see my children taken care of.
[01:25:05.500 --> 01:25:09.500]   What fulfills me is my family being taken care of.
[01:25:09.500 --> 01:25:12.500]   Not that during this 9 to 5, I'm happy.
[01:25:12.500 --> 01:25:17.500]   My happiness doesn't come from my own flesh.
[01:25:17.500 --> 01:25:22.500]   Follow your dreams is not biblical.
[01:25:22.500 --> 01:25:24.500]   Follow God's dreams.
[01:25:24.500 --> 01:25:28.500]   His desire, He says, "We are hidden in Christ."
[01:25:28.500 --> 01:25:31.500]   When He comes in glory, we will be glorified with Him.
[01:25:31.500 --> 01:25:36.500]   But while we're here, God has placed that responsibility on the shoulders of men.
[01:25:36.500 --> 01:25:42.500]   Fourth and finally, the primary call of the Father is redemption.
[01:25:42.500 --> 01:25:44.500]   Primary call of the Father is redemption.
[01:25:44.500 --> 01:25:48.500]   Says Psalm 103.13, "Just as the Father has compassion on His children,
[01:25:48.500 --> 01:25:51.500]   so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him."
[01:25:51.500 --> 01:25:58.500]   And the imagery that Jesus gives of Him pursuing sinners is the prodigal son.
[01:25:58.500 --> 01:26:03.500]   And the Father patiently waits for the son to return.
[01:26:03.500 --> 01:26:08.500]   And so the imagery that He gives of redemption is of Father and Son.
[01:26:08.500 --> 01:26:13.500]   The primary call of a father is to bring salvation to the home.
[01:26:13.500 --> 01:26:14.500]   That's his primary call.
[01:26:14.500 --> 01:26:17.500]   And that's why he says in John 10.10-16, Jesus says,
[01:26:17.500 --> 01:26:19.500]   "The thief comes only to steal and kill and destroy.
[01:26:19.500 --> 01:26:22.500]   I came that they may have life and have it abundantly."
[01:26:22.500 --> 01:26:25.500]   How is He going to do that? He says in verse 11, "I am the good shepherd."
[01:26:25.500 --> 01:26:28.500]   The good shepherd lays down his life for the sheep.
[01:26:28.500 --> 01:26:32.500]   He who is a hired hand and not a shepherd, who is not the owner of the sheep,
[01:26:32.500 --> 01:26:34.500]   sees the wolf coming and leaves the sheep and flees,
[01:26:34.500 --> 01:26:37.500]   and the wolf snatches them and scatters them.
[01:26:37.500 --> 01:26:41.500]   He flees because he is a hired hand and is not concerned about the sheep.
[01:26:41.500 --> 01:26:45.500]   I am the good shepherd. I know my own. My own knows me.
[01:26:45.500 --> 01:26:49.500]   He said that responsibility to take care of your children in your home
[01:26:49.500 --> 01:26:52.500]   is the responsibility of the Father.
[01:26:52.500 --> 01:26:56.500]   And if you hand that over to anybody else, when danger comes and hardship comes,
[01:26:56.500 --> 01:26:59.500]   they are going to be going to self-survival mode,
[01:26:59.500 --> 01:27:02.500]   and your children are not going to be taken care of.
[01:27:02.500 --> 01:27:08.500]   He says the call of the Father, the good shepherd, is to lay down His life for the sheep.
[01:27:08.500 --> 01:27:12.500]   That's what we've been called to, to lay down our life for our sheep.
[01:27:12.500 --> 01:27:18.500]   Every father, your sheep is your children, your own family.
[01:27:18.500 --> 01:27:23.500]   And so we are here. God has called us to lead by laying down our life.
[01:27:23.500 --> 01:27:30.500]   Isn't that what He says about relationship between husband and wife in Ephesians 5, 22 and on?
[01:27:30.500 --> 01:27:35.500]   That as Christ gave His life to wash and regenerate the wife,
[01:27:35.500 --> 01:27:39.500]   He said that's what's been given to our fathers,
[01:27:39.500 --> 01:27:42.500]   to lay down our life.
[01:27:42.500 --> 01:27:45.500]   And if you hand that responsibility to anybody else,
[01:27:45.500 --> 01:27:48.500]   when danger comes, they will flee,
[01:27:48.500 --> 01:27:51.500]   and your family will not be safe.
[01:27:51.500 --> 01:27:54.500]   And He goes on to say, "I have other sheep which are not in the fold.
[01:27:54.500 --> 01:27:57.500]   I must bring them also, and they will hear my voice,
[01:27:57.500 --> 01:28:01.500]   and they will become one flock with one shepherd."
[01:28:01.500 --> 01:28:04.500]   Now let me conclude with this.
[01:28:04.500 --> 01:28:09.500]   I had a conversation with a young father recently,
[01:28:09.500 --> 01:28:13.500]   and they were away, and I don't want to mention his name because I don't want to embarrass him,
[01:28:13.500 --> 01:28:17.500]   but I was so encouraged by the conversation because they were away,
[01:28:17.500 --> 01:28:21.500]   back in another country in their hometown, and in the months that they were there,
[01:28:21.500 --> 01:28:24.500]   he said they were wrestling, him and his wife were wrestling,
[01:28:24.500 --> 01:28:27.500]   because it's a much easier place to live.
[01:28:27.500 --> 01:28:30.500]   They have relatives there to take care of their children.
[01:28:30.500 --> 01:28:32.500]   The government is a lot more conservative.
[01:28:32.500 --> 01:28:36.500]   In fact, in their public school, they would have an option to have Christian education,
[01:28:36.500 --> 01:28:39.500]   in public school.
[01:28:39.500 --> 01:28:43.500]   So they said in every way, it's a much easier life, it's a slow pace of life,
[01:28:43.500 --> 01:28:47.500]   and their lifestyle would be much better over there.
[01:28:47.500 --> 01:28:51.500]   But during the whole time, they wrestled with finding a good church to go to.
[01:28:51.500 --> 01:28:54.500]   And so he said that they were going back and forth, and at the end,
[01:28:54.500 --> 01:28:59.500]   the reason why they made that decision is because they wanted their children to be raised at Berean.
[01:28:59.500 --> 01:29:03.500]   And he said the reason why--not to say that Berean is the only church,
[01:29:03.500 --> 01:29:07.500]   but because they had such a hard time finding a church, he said the reason why they came is
[01:29:07.500 --> 01:29:12.500]   so even though they may have a much easier, physically protected, more comfortable life over there,
[01:29:12.500 --> 01:29:17.500]   I'd rather put my children in a situation where they will hear the gospel and be safe.
[01:29:17.500 --> 01:29:24.500]   Their salvation is more important than anything else that they may be able to provide over there.
[01:29:24.500 --> 01:29:27.500]   And I was so encouraged by that
[01:29:27.500 --> 01:29:30.500]   because our church is filled with young families.
[01:29:30.500 --> 01:29:34.500]   I wish I had better instruction when I was younger
[01:29:34.500 --> 01:29:37.500]   so that I wouldn't have bought Hanna-Barbera.
[01:29:37.500 --> 01:29:42.500]   You know, there's a lot of other decisions that I made.
[01:29:42.500 --> 01:29:50.500]   When I look back at the years, and I wish--there are certain things that I did differently.
[01:29:50.500 --> 01:29:54.500]   None of my regret has to do with finance,
[01:29:54.500 --> 01:29:57.500]   even though we had some hardships in finance.
[01:29:57.500 --> 01:30:01.500]   Everything that I regret has to do with my children.
[01:30:01.500 --> 01:30:04.500]   That I wish I spent more time with them.
[01:30:04.500 --> 01:30:07.500]   And it wasn't because I wasn't around.
[01:30:07.500 --> 01:30:12.500]   I was just so busy with church.
[01:30:12.500 --> 01:30:16.500]   And, you know, yesterday we celebrated Father's Day and my kids took me out.
[01:30:16.500 --> 01:30:18.500]   So they're all older and they have some money now.
[01:30:18.500 --> 01:30:22.500]   Now they actually can pay for dinner and they got me a nice iPad, you know,
[01:30:22.500 --> 01:30:25.500]   which was fantastic, you know.
[01:30:25.500 --> 01:30:27.500]   I'm going to use and take to Korea.
[01:30:27.500 --> 01:30:32.500]   But to be honest, the best gift that I will remember from yesterday
[01:30:32.500 --> 01:30:36.500]   was we got a long extended time to spend together, you know.
[01:30:36.500 --> 01:30:41.500]   And we had dinner together, then we went and got some yogurt land.
[01:30:41.500 --> 01:30:44.500]   And to be honest, I don't know if they were antsy to get out
[01:30:44.500 --> 01:30:46.500]   because it's so hard to get the older children to come.
[01:30:46.500 --> 01:30:49.500]   They all have jobs and they have their own friends and all this stuff.
[01:30:49.500 --> 01:30:53.500]   So it's hard. We have to make an appointment with them to have family dinner.
[01:30:53.500 --> 01:30:58.500]   And it just happens that both of my older children's girlfriends were not in town,
[01:30:58.500 --> 01:31:01.500]   so they had more time.
[01:31:01.500 --> 01:31:03.500]   So we're just sticking around, we're just, you know.
[01:31:03.500 --> 01:31:07.500]   And then we go--nothing special, we're just kind of sitting around.
[01:31:07.500 --> 01:31:12.500]   And so we were able to spend hours together, which is so rare, you know.
[01:31:12.500 --> 01:31:15.500]   But that's what made me happy more than anything else,
[01:31:15.500 --> 01:31:18.500]   that I was able to spend that kind of time with my children.
[01:31:18.500 --> 01:31:23.500]   And if there's any regret, I wish they were smaller when they didn't drive
[01:31:23.500 --> 01:31:28.500]   and they were stuck with me, and so I could have that kind of time with them.
[01:31:28.500 --> 01:31:33.500]   And I remember when I was in India, I had a dream that my second son, Isaiah--
[01:31:33.500 --> 01:31:37.500]   I don't know why, but he came out as a 3-year-old in my dream in India.
[01:31:37.500 --> 01:31:40.500]   I have better dreams in India for some reason.
[01:31:40.500 --> 01:31:45.500]   And I remember being so happy that he was with me.
[01:31:45.500 --> 01:31:49.500]   I remember just holding him, just walking around, just having silly talk with him
[01:31:49.500 --> 01:31:53.500]   and just thinking, like, "Oh, I get to experience this again with my kid."
[01:31:53.500 --> 01:31:56.500]   And I woke up and was like, "Oh, it was a dream."
[01:31:56.500 --> 01:31:58.500]   But the dream was so real.
[01:31:58.500 --> 01:32:01.500]   The dream was so real, I was like, "Oh."
[01:32:01.500 --> 01:32:04.500]   I felt it emotionally, I was able to experience that again.
[01:32:04.500 --> 01:32:08.500]   But, you know, those years have passed many, many years.
[01:32:08.500 --> 01:32:12.500]   When we're young parents, we get so caught up in the next stage,
[01:32:12.500 --> 01:32:15.500]   eager to have our kids there and then move on to the next.
[01:32:15.500 --> 01:32:20.500]   And then once you get there, you live the rest of your life regretting.
[01:32:20.500 --> 01:32:26.500]   I wish I was more present and understood how time flies.
[01:32:26.500 --> 01:32:30.500]   And so all the priorities that we had when we were younger gets flipped upside down,
[01:32:30.500 --> 01:32:37.500]   thinking I would give up so much if I could just have the kids in my home again.
[01:32:37.500 --> 01:32:45.500]   That responsibility, especially to young men, is on our shoulder,
[01:32:45.500 --> 01:32:48.500]   to be good fathers, to be good men,
[01:32:48.500 --> 01:32:53.500]   so that our boys would also grow up to be good men and good fathers.
[01:32:53.500 --> 01:32:57.500]   Do not allow the pressure that's coming from our culture
[01:32:57.500 --> 01:33:02.500]   to dictate your priorities at this stage of life.
[01:33:02.500 --> 01:33:05.500]   Let the Word of God richly indwell in you
[01:33:05.500 --> 01:33:08.500]   that we do not follow the pattern of this world,
[01:33:08.500 --> 01:33:12.500]   but be transformed by the renewing of our mind.
[01:33:12.500 --> 01:33:14.500]   So as we celebrate Father's Day today,
[01:33:14.500 --> 01:33:19.500]   and I know that some of you may be older,
[01:33:19.500 --> 01:33:23.500]   and there's a lot of things that you regret in life,
[01:33:23.500 --> 01:33:25.500]   but God is gracious.
[01:33:25.500 --> 01:33:29.500]   None of this is so that we can feel ashamed.
[01:33:29.500 --> 01:33:33.500]   All of this is so that the next generation of people,
[01:33:33.500 --> 01:33:36.500]   that we would stand firm as Joshua did,
[01:33:36.500 --> 01:33:38.500]   that no matter what is happening around there,
[01:33:38.500 --> 01:33:41.500]   for me and my household, we will serve the Lord.
[01:33:41.500 --> 01:33:50.500]   Let's pray.
[01:33:50.500 --> 01:33:54.500]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing, for your guidance.
[01:33:54.500 --> 01:33:59.500]   Lord, we know the burden that the men in our church have on our shoulders.
[01:33:59.500 --> 01:34:04.500]   Help us, Lord God, not to flee from it, not to pass it on,
[01:34:04.500 --> 01:34:07.500]   but help us, Lord God, to act like men,
[01:34:07.500 --> 01:34:14.500]   to take up that burden for the sake of our wives and our children,
[01:34:14.500 --> 01:34:17.500]   that they would be blessed as you blessed us,
[01:34:17.500 --> 01:34:21.500]   that they would know you as you drew near to us.
[01:34:21.500 --> 01:34:25.500]   And so I pray, especially now, Lord God, as our school systems,
[01:34:25.500 --> 01:34:30.500]   or even our government is actively practicing and pushing laws, Lord God,
[01:34:30.500 --> 01:34:34.500]   that is contrary to your laws,
[01:34:34.500 --> 01:34:36.500]   help us, Lord God, as a church,
[01:34:36.500 --> 01:34:40.500]   and particularly as men and fathers, to stand firm,
[01:34:40.500 --> 01:34:45.500]   that we would stand, Lord God, to fight this good fight,
[01:34:45.500 --> 01:34:49.500]   that our homes, Lord, that there would be no question,
[01:34:49.500 --> 01:34:53.500]   is a place where we have committed to follow Christ.
[01:34:53.500 --> 01:34:55.500]   And for that end, we pray for your blessing and strength.
[01:34:55.500 --> 01:34:57.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:34:57.500 --> 01:35:03.500]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:35:03.500 --> 01:35:23.500]   [music]
[01:35:23.500 --> 01:35:33.500]   I once was lost in darkest night, yet thought I knew the way.
[01:35:33.500 --> 01:35:42.500]   The sin that promised joy and light had led me to the grave.
[01:35:42.500 --> 01:35:52.500]   I had no hope that you would all arrive all to your will.
[01:35:52.500 --> 01:36:13.500]   And if you have not loved me first, I would refuse you still.
[01:36:13.500 --> 01:36:23.500]   But as I ran, my help arose, different to the cost.
[01:36:23.500 --> 01:36:32.500]   You looked upon my helplessness and led me to the cross.
[01:36:32.500 --> 01:36:37.500]   And I beheld God's bloodless flame.
[01:36:37.500 --> 01:36:42.500]   You suffered in my place.
[01:36:42.500 --> 01:36:46.500]   You poured out, you served for me.
[01:36:46.500 --> 01:36:54.500]   Now all I know is grace.
[01:36:54.500 --> 01:36:59.500]   Alleluia.
[01:36:59.500 --> 01:37:04.500]   All I have is Christ.
[01:37:04.500 --> 01:37:08.500]   Alleluia.
[01:37:08.500 --> 01:37:13.500]   Jesus is my life.
[01:37:13.500 --> 01:37:17.500]   Alleluia.
[01:37:17.500 --> 01:37:22.500]   All I have is Christ.
[01:37:22.500 --> 01:37:27.500]   Alleluia.
[01:37:27.500 --> 01:37:50.500]   Jesus is my life.
[01:37:50.500 --> 01:37:55.500]   Now Lord, I would be yours alone.
[01:37:55.500 --> 01:38:09.500]   And if so all might see, the strength to follow your commands could never come from me.
[01:38:09.500 --> 01:38:19.500]   Oh Father, you, my ransom, I, in any way you should.
[01:38:19.500 --> 01:38:31.500]   Let my song forever be my only constant issue.
[01:38:31.500 --> 01:38:36.500]   Alleluia.
[01:38:36.500 --> 01:38:40.500]   All I have is Christ.
[01:38:40.500 --> 01:38:45.500]   Alleluia.
[01:38:45.500 --> 01:38:50.500]   Jesus is my life.
[01:38:50.500 --> 01:38:54.500]   Alleluia.
[01:38:54.500 --> 01:38:59.500]   All I have is Christ.
[01:38:59.500 --> 01:39:04.500]   Alleluia.
[01:39:04.500 --> 01:39:09.500]   Jesus is my life.
[01:39:09.500 --> 01:39:14.500]   Alleluia.
[01:39:14.500 --> 01:39:19.500]   All I have is Christ.
[01:39:19.500 --> 01:39:24.500]   Alleluia.
[01:39:24.500 --> 01:39:29.500]   Jesus is my life.
[01:39:29.500 --> 01:39:32.500]   Pray.
[01:39:32.500 --> 01:39:41.500]   Heavenly Father, Lord, you know our weaknesses, you know our fear, you know our mistakes, you know our regrets.
[01:39:41.500 --> 01:39:45.500]   Help us, Lord God, that your grace would be sufficient.
[01:39:45.500 --> 01:39:49.500]   It would be sufficient, Lord, for us not to look behind.
[01:39:49.500 --> 01:39:56.500]   It would be sufficient, Lord God, that we may run the race with perseverance today.
[01:39:56.500 --> 01:40:05.500]   That it would be sufficient to keep us hoping and striving after righteousness as you have placed before us.
[01:40:05.500 --> 01:40:12.500]   I pray, Father God, especially now as we celebrate Father's Day, to establish the men in our church, Lord God,
[01:40:12.500 --> 01:40:16.500]   to be the strength, to be the leaders in our home.
[01:40:16.500 --> 01:40:27.500]   That as the world is attacking manhood, families, I pray, Father God, that we would stand strong against the tide.
[01:40:27.500 --> 01:40:32.500]   That we would be a brighter light than ever in this dark world.
[01:40:32.500 --> 01:40:38.500]   As you warned us, as evil is increasing, that love of many will grow cold.
[01:40:38.500 --> 01:40:41.500]   Help us, Lord God, not to fall into that temptation.
[01:40:41.500 --> 01:40:50.500]   Help us not to make a goal to win in this rat race, but to live as sojourners who are simply passing through.
[01:40:50.500 --> 01:40:56.500]   That we would simply be a greater and greater light and the aroma of Christ wherever you send us.
[01:40:56.500 --> 01:40:58.500]   In Christ's name we pray.
[01:40:58.500 --> 01:41:00.500]   Amen.
[01:41:00.500 --> 01:41:03.500]   [music]
[01:41:04.500 --> 01:41:09.500]   They called Him Jesus
[01:41:09.500 --> 01:41:14.500]   He came to us
[01:41:14.500 --> 01:41:18.500]   Healed and forgave
[01:41:18.500 --> 01:41:23.500]   He lived and died
[01:41:23.500 --> 01:41:28.500]   To buy my pardon
[01:41:28.500 --> 01:41:33.500]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:41:33.500 --> 01:41:38.500]   My Savior lives
[01:41:38.500 --> 01:41:43.500]   Because He lives
[01:41:43.500 --> 01:41:48.500]   I can face tomorrow
[01:41:48.500 --> 01:41:52.500]   Because He lives
[01:41:52.500 --> 01:41:57.500]   All fear is gone
[01:41:57.500 --> 01:42:02.500]   Because I know
[01:42:02.500 --> 01:42:07.500]   He holds the future
[01:42:07.500 --> 01:42:11.500]   And life is worth the living
[01:42:11.500 --> 01:42:16.500]   Just because He lives
[01:42:16.500 --> 01:42:19.500]   [music]
[01:42:19.500 --> 01:42:24.500]   Fearful weight of true obedience
[01:42:24.500 --> 01:42:29.500]   It was sent by Him alone
[01:42:29.500 --> 01:42:34.500]   One wondrous faith to bear the cross
