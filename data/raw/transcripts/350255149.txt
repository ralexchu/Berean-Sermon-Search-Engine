[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Turn your Bibles to Hebrews 4, 1-10.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:13.440]   Hebrews 4, verses 1-10.
[00:00:13.440 --> 00:00:17.120]   Reading out of the NASB, "Therefore, let us fear if while a promise remains
[00:00:17.120 --> 00:00:21.320]   of entering his rest, any one of you may seem to have come short of it.
[00:00:21.320 --> 00:00:24.560]   For indeed, we have had good news preached to us just as they also,
[00:00:24.560 --> 00:00:28.600]   but the word they heard did not profit them because it was not united by faith
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.040]   in those who heard.
[00:00:30.040 --> 00:00:33.640]   For we who believed enter that rest just as he has said,
[00:00:33.640 --> 00:00:37.640]   'As I swore my wrath, they shall not enter my rest.'
[00:00:37.640 --> 00:00:40.600]   Although his works were finished from the foundation of the world,
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:44.440]   for he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day, and God rested on the seventh
[00:00:44.440 --> 00:00:46.040]   day from all his works.
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:48.960]   And again in this passage, 'They shall not enter my rest.'
[00:00:48.960 --> 00:00:52.480]   Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it, and those who formerly had good
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:55.680]   news preached to them failed to enter because of disobedience,
[00:00:55.680 --> 00:00:58.680]   he again fixes a certain day today saying through David,
[00:00:58.680 --> 00:01:02.200]   'After so long a time, just as has been said before,
[00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:04.960]   today if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts.
[00:01:04.960 --> 00:01:08.960]   For if Joshua had given them rest, he would not have spoken of another day
[00:01:08.960 --> 00:01:09.880]   after that.
[00:01:09.880 --> 00:01:13.680]   So there remains a Sabbath rest for the people of God.
[00:01:13.680 --> 00:01:18.320]   For the one who has entered his rest has himself also rested from his works as God
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:19.080]   did from his."
[00:01:19.080 --> 00:01:22.880]   Let's pray.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:26.640]   Gracious and loving Father, we thank you so much for being patient
[00:01:26.640 --> 00:01:28.560]   with us.
[00:01:28.560 --> 00:01:31.920]   Help us to discern the thoughts and intentions of our own hearts, Lord God,
[00:01:31.920 --> 00:01:34.960]   as your word is taught.
[00:01:34.960 --> 00:01:37.200]   We know that you have ordained it.
[00:01:37.200 --> 00:01:41.400]   It would be our food, the source of our comfort and strength,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.160]   sanctification, or salvation.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:48.520]   So we pray, Father God, as the word goes forth, as you have ordained,
[00:01:48.520 --> 00:01:52.320]   that it would not return until it has accomplished your purpose.
[00:01:52.320 --> 00:01:54.840]   We desire to honor you.
[00:01:54.840 --> 00:01:56.680]   We desire to worship you.
[00:01:56.680 --> 00:01:59.360]   May this time be acceptable before your eyes.
[00:01:59.360 --> 00:02:00.440]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:00.440 --> 00:02:02.080]   Amen.
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.360]   Okay, so as you guys know, we had VBS run this week.
[00:02:05.360 --> 00:02:09.120]   And for many of the parents and children, it's the highlight of the year.
[00:02:09.120 --> 00:02:13.760]   So much time and effort goes into preparing, and so many volunteers come.
[00:02:13.760 --> 00:02:18.680]   And so, you know, it was kind of sad because it was our last VBS for our
[00:02:18.680 --> 00:02:22.320]   youngest child, so next year he won't be doing VBS.
[00:02:22.320 --> 00:02:26.720]   And I was talking to Isaiah, and Isaiah was, you know, he's already kind of
[00:02:26.720 --> 00:02:27.240]   missing it.
[00:02:27.240 --> 00:02:29.720]   And he said, "Can I at least help next year?"
[00:02:29.720 --> 00:02:32.520]   And I said, "Well, you have to be baptized and be a member."
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:37.680]   And so he said he's going to be baptized.
[00:02:37.680 --> 00:02:39.360]   So again, it was a long week.
[00:02:39.360 --> 00:02:41.880]   A lot of people, you know, volunteered.
[00:02:41.880 --> 00:02:44.040]   So Friday night, I'm sure everybody was exhausted.
[00:02:44.040 --> 00:02:48.840]   And, you know, at the end of a long week like that, you know, you naturally tend
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:50.280]   to think, "What am I going to do to rest?"
[00:02:50.280 --> 00:02:53.520]   So maybe some of you guys were able to get some rest yesterday.
[00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:57.000]   And I know for some of you guys, yesterday was another long day.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.600]   But what do you do when you're fatigued, when you're tired?
[00:03:01.600 --> 00:03:01.760]   Right?
[00:03:01.760 --> 00:03:04.560]   Sometimes if you have small children, if you went on a vacation, you're probably
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:06.120]   more tired after the vacation.
[00:03:06.120 --> 00:03:08.360]   But what do you do to rewind?
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.320]   What do you do to find rest?
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:10.520]   Right?
[00:03:10.520 --> 00:03:14.520]   Some people will sit on their couch and watch Netflix.
[00:03:14.520 --> 00:03:18.080]   Some people will go grab something to eat or sleep in.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:22.280]   We're all doing that because we need to recuperate so that we can get back to work.
[00:03:22.280 --> 00:03:23.840]   Right?
[00:03:23.840 --> 00:03:28.280]   The text that we're looking at today in chapter 4, the theme of the whole chapter
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.000]   is about rest in Christ.
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:37.480]   We've been talking about how the warning about not drifting from this God,
[00:03:37.480 --> 00:03:42.000]   from Christ, who he's greater than the angels, he's greater than Moses,
[00:03:42.000 --> 00:03:45.400]   and so the danger of drifting away from God.
[00:03:45.400 --> 00:03:50.720]   And so the previous chapter, in chapter 3, it was a warning against if you hear his
[00:03:50.720 --> 00:03:55.040]   voice today, not to harden your heart because tomorrow you may not hear his voice.
[00:03:55.040 --> 00:03:58.440]   And there's an ordained time for people to repent and come to Christ.
[00:03:58.440 --> 00:04:02.600]   And if you ignore that, if you sweep that under the rug, he says,
[00:04:02.600 --> 00:04:05.480]   "The next time you come around, it may be even more difficult."
[00:04:05.480 --> 00:04:09.720]   Chapter 4 is leading us to the "let us" statement.
[00:04:09.720 --> 00:04:12.640]   So if you read through chapter 4, you'll notice that there are four
[00:04:12.640 --> 00:04:13.400]   "let us" statements.
[00:04:13.400 --> 00:04:18.880]   The first one we find in verse 1 where he says, "Let us fear if a promise remains
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:20.920]   of entering the rest."
[00:04:20.920 --> 00:04:23.160]   The second one is found in verse 11.
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:26.600]   He says, "Therefore, let us be diligent to enter the rest."
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:30.560]   And then verse 14, it says, "Since we have a great high priest who has
[00:04:30.560 --> 00:04:33.960]   passed through the heavens," did I get that right?
[00:04:33.960 --> 00:04:36.440]   "Let us hold fast our confession."
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:40.200]   And then verse 16 is, "Therefore, let us draw near with confidence."
[00:04:40.200 --> 00:04:45.480]   So all these "let us" statements together are kind of guiding us through if you hear
[00:04:45.480 --> 00:04:50.520]   his voice and you believe and you're taking his warning seriously,
[00:04:50.520 --> 00:04:52.320]   these are the things that we ought to do.
[00:04:52.320 --> 00:04:54.840]   These are the things that we need to apply.
[00:04:54.840 --> 00:04:59.040]   So I remember back in seminary, my professor would always say,
[00:04:59.040 --> 00:05:01.640]   we repeated it so many times in our hermeneutics class,
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.080]   in interpretation class.
[00:05:03.080 --> 00:05:08.640]   He says, "If you apply the Bible without proper interpretation,
[00:05:08.640 --> 00:05:10.840]   it's a miscarriage."
[00:05:10.840 --> 00:05:13.720]   Because if you don't know what the Word of God says or you have a very superficial
[00:05:13.720 --> 00:05:17.160]   understanding of what the Word of God says, then the application is obviously
[00:05:17.160 --> 00:05:19.280]   is going to be wrong.
[00:05:19.280 --> 00:05:23.320]   So oftentimes, without study of the Bible, we begin to project unto God,
[00:05:23.320 --> 00:05:25.600]   "Well, since you're loving God, you ought to be doing this.
[00:05:25.600 --> 00:05:27.800]   Since the church is this, the church should be this.
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.200]   Or since you are this way, you ought to be this way."
[00:05:30.200 --> 00:05:34.760]   And so our application of what we know of Scripture or we think we know
[00:05:34.760 --> 00:05:39.200]   of Scripture can be wrong without careful examination of what the Word of God says.
[00:05:39.200 --> 00:05:43.320]   So application without interpretation is miscarriage.
[00:05:43.320 --> 00:05:46.880]   But then the flip side of it, he would often say, "But interpretation
[00:05:46.880 --> 00:05:49.440]   without application is abortion."
[00:05:49.440 --> 00:05:52.840]   Because the whole point of the study of the Bible is not just for us to say,
[00:05:52.840 --> 00:05:57.440]   "Aha, I know, I understand," and to be able to take a test and say,
[00:05:57.440 --> 00:05:59.560]   "I got the answers right."
[00:05:59.560 --> 00:06:03.960]   The whole point of exposition and study of the Word of God is to lead us to these
[00:06:03.960 --> 00:06:06.880]   let-out statements, this application.
[00:06:06.880 --> 00:06:11.200]   Because an individual who's constantly studying with very little application,
[00:06:11.200 --> 00:06:18.440]   all it does for that person is becomes a puffed-up individual who becomes an expert,
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:23.200]   expert on what the Word of God says, but has no idea of who God is.
[00:06:23.200 --> 00:06:24.960]   So let's look at the first let-out statement.
[00:06:24.960 --> 00:06:27.760]   So I'm going to take some time each week going over these let-out statements.
[00:06:27.760 --> 00:06:33.280]   But the first one we begin with, he says, "Let us fear if while a promise
[00:06:33.280 --> 00:06:35.080]   remains of entering His rest."
[00:06:35.080 --> 00:06:42.960]   So the fear that he's warning us of is that we would fall short of that rest.
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.960]   So the first question we need to ask is, why would he tell us to fear so that we
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:48.840]   could enter the rest?
[00:06:48.840 --> 00:06:51.600]   Because it sounds like an oxymoron.
[00:06:51.600 --> 00:06:56.440]   Doesn't it sound like maybe the fear itself is what's causing the unrest?
[00:06:56.440 --> 00:07:01.680]   You know, you don't think of having fear of wanting to rest,
[00:07:01.680 --> 00:07:06.360]   because rest, we typically think of just doing nothing, relax, right?
[00:07:06.360 --> 00:07:10.480]   I mean, an individual who's living his life in fear is constantly anxious.
[00:07:10.480 --> 00:07:13.480]   We don't think of a person who's resting.
[00:07:13.480 --> 00:07:18.760]   In fact, if you look at later part of that verse, or later part of it,
[00:07:18.760 --> 00:07:21.440]   it not only tells us to fear.
[00:07:21.440 --> 00:07:25.680]   In verse 10, it says, "For the one who has entered his rest," sorry,
[00:07:25.680 --> 00:07:30.560]   it calls us in verse 11 to work to enter that rest.
[00:07:30.560 --> 00:07:35.240]   So working to rest, fearing to rest.
[00:07:35.240 --> 00:07:38.240]   It sounds like an oxymoron if you understand it superficially.
[00:07:38.240 --> 00:07:42.480]   If we begin to project our understanding of rest to what he is saying,
[00:07:42.480 --> 00:07:44.560]   it doesn't make much sense.
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:47.920]   So the first thing that we need to tackle is, what does he mean by this rest?
[00:07:47.920 --> 00:07:50.720]   And why is it so important that we need to be working,
[00:07:50.720 --> 00:07:55.240]   we need to be fearing to make sure that we're entering this rest?
[00:07:55.240 --> 00:07:58.920]   Well, he answers that question in this text in verse 4 and verse 10.
[00:07:58.920 --> 00:08:02.320]   He said that the rest that he is referring to is the rest
[00:08:02.320 --> 00:08:05.560]   that God entered into on the seventh day, on verse 4.
[00:08:05.560 --> 00:08:08.440]   "For he has said somewhere concerning the seventh day,
[00:08:08.440 --> 00:08:12.400]   'And God rested on the seventh day from all his works.'"
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:15.480]   So in other words, he's not simply talking about not working,
[00:08:15.480 --> 00:08:19.400]   even though that is part of the definition of the word rest.
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.960]   He's referring specifically to the rest that God entered into in creation.
[00:08:24.960 --> 00:08:28.960]   After six days of creation, God entered into that rest.
[00:08:28.960 --> 00:08:33.240]   Verse 10, "For the one who has entered his rest has himself also rested
[00:08:33.240 --> 00:08:37.000]   from his works as God did from his."
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.240]   So in order to understand the biblical definition of rest,
[00:08:41.240 --> 00:08:44.160]   we need to understand what it means.
[00:08:44.160 --> 00:08:47.560]   What does it mean for God to enter that rest on the seventh day?
[00:08:47.560 --> 00:08:51.280]   In Genesis 2, 2-3, it says, "By the seventh day,
[00:08:51.280 --> 00:08:53.720]   God completed his work which he had done,
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:58.560]   and he rested on the seventh day from all his work which he had done.
[00:08:58.560 --> 00:09:01.080]   Then God blessed the seventh day and sanctified it."
[00:09:01.080 --> 00:09:03.000]   In other words, set it apart.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:10.480]   "Because in it, he rested from all his works which God had created and made."
[00:09:10.480 --> 00:09:18.080]   Our natural inclination is to think he worked for six days and he got tired.
[00:09:18.080 --> 00:09:21.200]   And so he needed to recuperate on the seventh day.
[00:09:21.200 --> 00:09:23.880]   And so he rested in order to get back to work on Monday.
[00:09:23.880 --> 00:09:27.600]   Because typically when we think of rest, that's what we think of.
[00:09:27.600 --> 00:09:31.200]   We've spent our energy, we're tired, we're going to go relax,
[00:09:31.200 --> 00:09:37.120]   not do work for a while, and then when I feel rested, then I can go back to work.
[00:09:37.120 --> 00:09:42.120]   Now that would be blasphemous, to think that God rested from his work
[00:09:42.120 --> 00:09:43.320]   because he was tired.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:48.080]   Because clearly the scripture says, in Isaiah 40-28, "Do you not know,
[00:09:48.080 --> 00:09:52.040]   have you not heard, the everlasting God, the Lord, the creator of the ends
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:55.920]   of the earth, does not become weary or tired.
[00:09:55.920 --> 00:09:58.400]   His understanding is inscrutable."
[00:09:58.400 --> 00:10:00.600]   In other words, he is immutable.
[00:10:00.600 --> 00:10:05.680]   The same energy and power and vigor that God had Monday in the beginning
[00:10:05.680 --> 00:10:12.840]   of creation is the same energy and vigor that he had on Saturday.
[00:10:12.840 --> 00:10:13.840]   He didn't...
[00:10:13.840 --> 00:10:16.040]   He's not like us, where we...
[00:10:16.040 --> 00:10:19.280]   Usually when we have VBS, we start out with a bang on Monday,
[00:10:19.280 --> 00:10:20.840]   Wednesday is a hump day, right?
[00:10:20.840 --> 00:10:25.320]   Just like your work day, we call it a hump day because it's difficult.
[00:10:25.320 --> 00:10:28.280]   You've already gotten wearied, you know, and then Friday is like,
[00:10:28.280 --> 00:10:29.640]   "Yeah, thank God for the weekend."
[00:10:29.640 --> 00:10:33.760]   And then you go to the weekend and then you have things to do to recuperate, right?
[00:10:33.760 --> 00:10:35.800]   And then you start over on Monday.
[00:10:35.800 --> 00:10:38.800]   So by the time VBS comes, Wednesday is a hump day, and then Friday,
[00:10:38.800 --> 00:10:42.000]   we finish with a bang because it's over, right?
[00:10:42.000 --> 00:10:43.840]   Is that what he means?
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:48.960]   Six days he labored, and then on Wednesday, he got fatigued,
[00:10:48.960 --> 00:10:50.920]   and then at the end of it, he got tired.
[00:10:50.920 --> 00:10:54.560]   So he entered into the Sabbath, he's like, "Oh, let's take a break."
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:58.880]   Clearly, that's not what the Sabbath is referring to because God is immutable.
[00:10:58.880 --> 00:11:00.800]   He does not grow weary or tired.
[00:11:00.800 --> 00:11:02.760]   He is not man.
[00:11:02.760 --> 00:11:09.360]   So what does it mean then for him to enter the Sabbath and for mankind
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:11.320]   to enter the Sabbath with him?
[00:11:11.320 --> 00:11:15.600]   Well, I think it helps us to understand what happened after the fall.
[00:11:15.600 --> 00:11:19.280]   One sin entered, they were separated from God.
[00:11:19.280 --> 00:11:24.600]   In Genesis 3, 16 to 19, it describes the penalty of this sin.
[00:11:24.600 --> 00:11:29.720]   God said, "You shall surely die if you eat of this tree of knowledge of good and evil.
[00:11:29.720 --> 00:11:31.800]   If you disobey me, you shall surely die."
[00:11:31.800 --> 00:11:35.680]   But when they eat it, they don't fall to the ground and physically disappear.
[00:11:35.680 --> 00:11:38.880]   In fact, they live for many, many years after that.
[00:11:38.880 --> 00:11:44.360]   But the description of this spiritual death is mentioned in Genesis 3, 16 to 19.
[00:11:44.360 --> 00:11:51.440]   And in that passage, it describes for the woman that she will bear children in much pain
[00:11:51.440 --> 00:11:55.600]   and that there's going to be contention between her and her husband.
[00:11:55.600 --> 00:12:03.360]   Now, if you look at that, her very reason of why God created her is described in that fall.
[00:12:03.360 --> 00:12:07.800]   God created her to be a suitable helper because it was not good for man to be alone.
[00:12:07.800 --> 00:12:15.480]   God created a partner to help her and that her primary role is to help her to be fruitful and to multiply.
[00:12:15.480 --> 00:12:19.200]   But the penalty of this sin, this spiritual death that comes in,
[00:12:19.200 --> 00:12:27.560]   is that the very thing that she was created for now is going to create contention and restlessness.
[00:12:27.560 --> 00:12:31.160]   She's going to still be with her husband. There's going to be contention in the home.
[00:12:31.160 --> 00:12:34.640]   She's going to bear children, but it's going to be very painful.
[00:12:34.640 --> 00:12:36.520]   Same thing with the husband.
[00:12:36.520 --> 00:12:42.240]   Adam was created so that he can be the ruler of all creation to subdue the land.
[00:12:42.240 --> 00:12:45.000]   But as soon as sin comes in, what does it say?
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:52.840]   By sweat of your brow, you're going to be laboring and it's going to produce thorns and thistles.
[00:12:52.840 --> 00:12:58.080]   And after all the hard work and restlessness and labor, what comes after that?
[00:12:58.080 --> 00:13:02.960]   He says it's death. From dust you come to dust you will go.
[00:13:02.960 --> 00:13:12.240]   So the very thing that they were created for, now it's going to turn into restlessness, contention, weeds.
[00:13:12.240 --> 00:13:15.480]   Thorns and thistles are going to be created by that same labor.
[00:13:15.480 --> 00:13:20.640]   So what does it mean to enter the Sabbath and to break the Sabbath?
[00:13:20.640 --> 00:13:25.080]   Well, Exodus chapter 31, 12-13, God makes a covenant with the nation of Israel.
[00:13:25.080 --> 00:13:30.480]   And this is what he said, "The Lord spoke to Moses saying, 'But I ask for you, speak to the sons of Israel, saying,
[00:13:30.480 --> 00:13:36.120]   'You shall surely observe my Sabbath, for this is a sign between me and you throughout your generation,
[00:13:36.120 --> 00:13:41.320]   that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you.'"
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:45.640]   Of all the things that God could have used as a covenant symbol,
[00:13:45.640 --> 00:13:51.000]   he says the Sabbath was one of the covenant symbols that God makes with the nation of Israel.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:57.480]   That this Sabbath is going to symbolize the relationship that God had with the nation of Israel.
[00:13:57.480 --> 00:14:01.880]   Now, the key to this is the second part when he says,
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:09.480]   "The reason why this is a covenant symbol is so that you may know that I am the Lord who sanctifies you."
[00:14:09.480 --> 00:14:13.880]   Now, if you are New Testament savvy, whenever you hear the word sanctify,
[00:14:13.880 --> 00:14:19.560]   you automatically think justification, sanctification, and glorification.
[00:14:19.560 --> 00:14:24.520]   So you say, "Oh, sanctification, he's talking about our spiritual maturity."
[00:14:24.520 --> 00:14:29.000]   Not necessarily. The word sanctify just literally means to be made holy.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:36.920]   Literally means to be set apart. So it's just a broad word to describe salvation.
[00:14:36.920 --> 00:14:46.440]   So in other words, God set aside and appointed the Sabbath to remind them that God is their salvation.
[00:14:46.440 --> 00:14:53.880]   So Sabbath is a symbol of salvation, if you follow.
[00:14:53.880 --> 00:15:01.480]   Sabbath is a symbol of salvation. So the definition of the Sabbath is,
[00:15:01.480 --> 00:15:07.400]   when Adam and Eve had fellowship with God, he was with God in the Sabbath, in rest.
[00:15:07.400 --> 00:15:11.640]   Did they work physically? Yes. If you read the book of Genesis,
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:16.040]   before they fall, they were working. But it was work in joy.
[00:15:16.040 --> 00:15:19.160]   They had fellowship, right? They had communion.
[00:15:19.160 --> 00:15:23.560]   They, you know, not this communion, but they had communion, right?
[00:15:23.560 --> 00:15:29.480]   But as soon as sin enters, they're doing the same work, but they're no longer in rest.
[00:15:29.480 --> 00:15:34.200]   There's a restlessness that comes into mankind. So the Sabbath is broken.
[00:15:34.200 --> 00:15:38.200]   So when you are with the Lord, you are in his Sabbath.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:41.800]   But because of sin, you are expelled from the Sabbath.
[00:15:41.800 --> 00:15:46.440]   And then there's restlessness. Now, the reason why this is so important
[00:15:46.440 --> 00:15:51.160]   is because if you read the Old Testament, Sabbath is a key part of his law.
[00:15:51.160 --> 00:15:53.800]   You can almost say it's the central part of his law.
[00:15:53.800 --> 00:15:58.120]   If you look at the Ten Commandments, all of the Ten Commandments are all very—
[00:15:58.120 --> 00:16:00.520]   like, we can understand why those Ten Commandments are there.
[00:16:00.520 --> 00:16:06.280]   It's a relationship with God, right? "Worship no other gods, no other graven images,
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:10.920]   shall not use the Lord's name in vain." And then he says, "You shall keep the Sabbath,"
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:15.800]   which is one of the only ceremonial law that is embedded in the Ten Commandments.
[00:16:15.800 --> 00:16:23.080]   And then every other law from the commandment after that is a law between other people.
[00:16:23.080 --> 00:16:26.200]   So you have this vertical relationship and horizontal relationship,
[00:16:26.200 --> 00:16:28.360]   but right at the center of that is the Sabbath.
[00:16:28.360 --> 00:16:31.960]   And why is the Sabbath in the Ten Commandments?
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:37.640]   Why was this particular law so important that he kept it in the Ten Commandments and repeated?
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:43.560]   In fact, if you break the Sabbath, the penalty for breaking the Sabbath was stoning.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:46.520]   They took him outside and they stoned him to death.
[00:16:46.520 --> 00:16:50.200]   And there was a heavy emphasis on keeping the Sabbath holy.
[00:16:50.200 --> 00:16:56.120]   You can see why the Pharisees in the New Testament were so concerned about breaking the Sabbath.
[00:16:56.120 --> 00:17:00.520]   Every time Jesus did something that broke their law—not God's law, but their law—
[00:17:00.520 --> 00:17:07.320]   they had a huge fit because they understood the weightiness of this law.
[00:17:07.320 --> 00:17:10.920]   The purpose of all of this is to bring us to understanding
[00:17:10.920 --> 00:17:14.680]   because the purpose of the Sabbath was not the Sabbath itself.
[00:17:14.680 --> 00:17:19.800]   It wasn't the rule keeping. In fact, it's spelled out in Colossians 2, 16-17.
[00:17:19.800 --> 00:17:24.440]   "Therefore, no one is to act as your judge in regard to food or drink
[00:17:24.440 --> 00:17:28.440]   or in respect to festivals or new moons or Sabbath day,
[00:17:28.440 --> 00:17:36.120]   things which are mere shadows of what is to come, but the substance belongs to Christ."
[00:17:36.120 --> 00:17:43.240]   All of this, all of the Sabbath was to prepare for the one who was going to fulfill this Sabbath.
[00:17:43.240 --> 00:17:47.480]   What was broken because of the broken fellowship with God.
[00:17:47.480 --> 00:17:51.240]   Christ was going to come and restore that Sabbath.
[00:17:51.240 --> 00:17:56.360]   So all of this was just a preparation to point to the coming of Christ.
[00:17:56.360 --> 00:18:00.120]   So when Jesus Christ comes, he says, Matthew 11, 28,
[00:18:00.120 --> 00:18:06.840]   "Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden," in what? "I will give you rest."
[00:18:06.840 --> 00:18:11.400]   He's speaking to people who are weary and heavy laden because of the broken Sabbath.
[00:18:11.400 --> 00:18:14.360]   And he says, "Take my yoke upon you and learn from me."
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:17.640]   What is yoke? We're not talking about the egg yoke.
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:21.720]   We're talking about the yoke that is put on an animal so that the animal can labor.
[00:18:21.720 --> 00:18:26.760]   So when he says, "Take my work," yoke is just another word in the New Testament
[00:18:26.760 --> 00:18:29.400]   or in farming to describe work.
[00:18:29.400 --> 00:18:33.480]   So when Jesus says, "Take my work upon you and learn from me,
[00:18:33.480 --> 00:18:38.120]   for I am gentle and humble in heart, and you will find rest for your soul,"
[00:18:38.120 --> 00:18:42.280]   what is the work that he is referring to?
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:47.960]   It's pretty clear. Jesus clearly says that he came to do the Father's will,
[00:18:47.960 --> 00:18:52.920]   to do his work, and the work is to atone for the sins of many.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:55.080]   He was going to give his life as a ransom.
[00:18:55.080 --> 00:18:59.880]   He who knew no sin became sin, that you and I can become the righteousness of God.
[00:18:59.880 --> 00:19:05.480]   So he said, "If you hear my voice and you take my work upon you,
[00:19:05.480 --> 00:19:10.120]   then and only then will you find true rest."
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:12.600]   So a distinction between a Christian and a non-Christian
[00:19:12.600 --> 00:19:16.520]   is a state of restlessness in a non-Christian,
[00:19:16.520 --> 00:19:21.000]   because he is constantly staggering from one place to another, seeking rest.
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:27.080]   A non-Christian cannot rest until his circumstances are exactly the way he desires.
[00:19:27.080 --> 00:19:31.000]   Until he eats what he wants and he drinks what he wants to drink,
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:35.240]   and he has the circumstances that he desires and he works for,
[00:19:35.240 --> 00:19:39.000]   he cannot truly find rest.
[00:19:39.000 --> 00:19:42.040]   Jesus says in John 4, 13-14,
[00:19:42.040 --> 00:19:47.160]   "Jesus answered and said to her, 'Everyone who drinks of this water will thirst again,
[00:19:47.160 --> 00:19:51.240]   but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall never thirst.
[00:19:51.240 --> 00:19:55.480]   But the water that I will give him will become in him a well of water,
[00:19:55.480 --> 00:19:57.640]   springing up to eternal life.'"
[00:19:57.640 --> 00:20:00.600]   In other words, he's describing an individual who drinks the water of Christ,
[00:20:00.600 --> 00:20:06.600]   who's taken his yoke upon him, and he has found true rest in Christ.
[00:20:06.600 --> 00:20:08.840]   Again, he says that in John 6, 35,
[00:20:08.840 --> 00:20:12.360]   people who ate the miraculous bread and the fish,
[00:20:12.360 --> 00:20:15.720]   they're coming to him because they want more.
[00:20:15.720 --> 00:20:18.920]   I mean, let's make him king, because if we make Jesus king,
[00:20:18.920 --> 00:20:21.160]   he's going to feed us.
[00:20:21.160 --> 00:20:24.040]   Not only is he going to feed us, I mean, if you're blind,
[00:20:24.040 --> 00:20:25.960]   he's going to give you free medication.
[00:20:25.960 --> 00:20:27.800]   He's going to make you walk.
[00:20:27.800 --> 00:20:31.240]   If you're a leopard, he's going to cleanse you.
[00:20:31.240 --> 00:20:32.600]   Who wouldn't want to make him king?
[00:20:32.600 --> 00:20:35.000]   So they stagger all over looking for him.
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:37.320]   When they finally see Jesus on the other side of Galilee,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:41.160]   Jesus says to him, "You're coming to me not because you know who I am.
[00:20:41.160 --> 00:20:43.560]   You're not coming because you understand what I've come to give you.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:46.040]   You're coming because you ate bread and you want more."
[00:20:46.040 --> 00:20:51.800]   And Jesus tells them in that chapter, "I am the bread of life.
[00:20:51.800 --> 00:20:56.680]   The bread that you eat, that you have eaten, you will be thirsty again.
[00:20:56.680 --> 00:20:59.960]   But the bread that I give you, if you eat of it,
[00:20:59.960 --> 00:21:02.120]   you'll never go hungry again."
[00:21:02.120 --> 00:21:04.920]   Obviously, he's not talking about a physical bread.
[00:21:04.920 --> 00:21:06.520]   And then right after that, he says,
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:09.080]   "If you do not eat of my flesh and drink of my blood,
[00:21:09.080 --> 00:21:10.120]   we have no relationship."
[00:21:10.120 --> 00:21:13.080]   He's talking about his work on the cross.
[00:21:13.080 --> 00:21:16.360]   That until you take your yoke upon you,
[00:21:16.360 --> 00:21:18.680]   you will always be staggering from place to place
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.160]   looking for the next fix.
[00:21:21.160 --> 00:21:23.320]   Now, whenever we talk about the next fix,
[00:21:23.320 --> 00:21:28.120]   we think of drug addicts or somebody who's done something illegal.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:30.920]   But every non-believer who does not know Christ
[00:21:30.920 --> 00:21:33.480]   is always looking for the next fix.
[00:21:33.480 --> 00:21:35.960]   It may not be sin.
[00:21:35.960 --> 00:21:37.720]   It could just be the next experience.
[00:21:37.720 --> 00:21:40.360]   It could just be the next job.
[00:21:40.360 --> 00:21:42.280]   It could just be comfort of bank accounts.
[00:21:42.280 --> 00:21:46.120]   Whatever it may be, a non-Christian is always looking for the next fix
[00:21:46.120 --> 00:21:48.600]   because they are always hungry and always thirsty.
[00:21:48.600 --> 00:21:51.400]   There's a sense of restlessness.
[00:21:51.400 --> 00:21:55.560]   You may sense a feel of rest momentarily because you took a nap,
[00:21:55.560 --> 00:21:57.240]   because you watched a movie,
[00:21:57.240 --> 00:22:00.840]   because you took a vacation and you went somewhere and came back,
[00:22:00.840 --> 00:22:02.760]   but it's never permanent.
[00:22:02.760 --> 00:22:07.400]   So the state of a non-Christian, state of a world who's dominated by sin
[00:22:07.400 --> 00:22:11.880]   is a constant need to find rest.
[00:22:11.880 --> 00:22:17.800]   The problem is that the rest is not here.
[00:22:17.800 --> 00:22:20.920]   Jesus says in Mark 2, 27-28,
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:23.560]   "The Sabbath was made for man, not man for the Sabbath.
[00:22:23.560 --> 00:22:26.840]   So the Son of Man is Lord even of the Sabbath.
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:29.800]   The Sabbath was created so that man could understand
[00:22:29.800 --> 00:22:33.960]   that his true Sabbath was to point to Christ.
[00:22:33.960 --> 00:22:36.840]   But they made it into these rule-keepings
[00:22:36.840 --> 00:22:40.200]   that if they kept all these sabbatical laws,
[00:22:40.200 --> 00:22:43.320]   that somehow they were going to earn their rest in Christ."
[00:22:43.320 --> 00:22:47.720]   And Jesus says, "If you do not understand that all of this was for me,
[00:22:47.720 --> 00:22:50.680]   in fact, the very thing that was made for you,
[00:22:50.680 --> 00:22:53.400]   you end up working for it."
[00:22:53.400 --> 00:22:58.120]   In other words, if we don't find Christ as our Sabbath,
[00:22:58.120 --> 00:23:01.880]   Christ will eventually become our burden.
[00:23:01.880 --> 00:23:04.760]   Some of you know exactly what I'm talking about.
[00:23:04.760 --> 00:23:07.400]   You may have started out your walk with God
[00:23:07.400 --> 00:23:09.960]   because you heard about His grace and love,
[00:23:09.960 --> 00:23:13.240]   and you couldn't wait to come to church, sing songs, surf,
[00:23:13.240 --> 00:23:15.080]   and fellowship was awesome,
[00:23:15.080 --> 00:23:16.760]   but at some point in your walk with God,
[00:23:16.760 --> 00:23:18.680]   you drifted away, your heart drifted away,
[00:23:18.680 --> 00:23:23.000]   and it just became work, something to do,
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.400]   something to do to appease God.
[00:23:25.400 --> 00:23:28.600]   Worship is not a place where you come to find refreshment,
[00:23:28.600 --> 00:23:30.280]   to be restored.
[00:23:30.280 --> 00:23:33.640]   Just like VBS, you work hard, and then when it's done,
[00:23:33.640 --> 00:23:37.640]   you go watch TV, relax, travel to find your rest.
[00:23:37.640 --> 00:23:40.520]   But church has become work.
[00:23:40.520 --> 00:23:42.280]   If Christ is not your Sabbath,
[00:23:42.280 --> 00:23:45.320]   Christ will eventually become your burden.
[00:23:45.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   Sunday mornings, I mean,
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:49.400]   think of all the things that you could be doing.
[00:23:49.400 --> 00:23:50.440]   I mean, especially us.
[00:23:50.440 --> 00:23:52.680]   We have access to movies, to travel.
[00:23:52.680 --> 00:23:56.040]   I mean, all the things that are at the tip of our hand,
[00:23:56.040 --> 00:24:00.760]   right in your pocket, in your phone, to distract you,
[00:24:00.760 --> 00:24:01.800]   and yet you're sitting here,
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:08.040]   listening to some short, dumpy guy
[00:24:08.040 --> 00:24:10.520]   who has something to say every single week,
[00:24:10.520 --> 00:24:12.200]   sounds the same every single week,
[00:24:12.200 --> 00:24:14.200]   and you put in your time for an hour and a half,
[00:24:14.200 --> 00:24:16.680]   and you're just putting up with me, right?
[00:24:16.680 --> 00:24:19.240]   And then afterwards, to reward your patience,
[00:24:19.240 --> 00:24:20.280]   we're going to collect your money.
[00:24:20.280 --> 00:24:21.420]   Yeah.
[00:24:21.420 --> 00:24:23.640]   That's what it feels like.
[00:24:23.640 --> 00:24:26.280]   If Christ is not your Sabbath,
[00:24:26.280 --> 00:24:27.720]   Christ becomes your burden.
[00:24:27.720 --> 00:24:31.320]   It is a burden that you're not going to bear for long.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:33.880]   If coming to church and serving God,
[00:24:33.880 --> 00:24:36.120]   and worshiping, and giving, and evangelism,
[00:24:36.120 --> 00:24:40.040]   if all it is is an obligation that needs to be carried out,
[00:24:40.040 --> 00:24:42.040]   you won't do it for long.
[00:24:42.040 --> 00:24:44.200]   If you happen to be an A student,
[00:24:44.200 --> 00:24:46.120]   and you went to a good college,
[00:24:46.120 --> 00:24:48.280]   and you know how to get good grades,
[00:24:48.280 --> 00:24:49.640]   you can do that for a while,
[00:24:49.640 --> 00:24:52.200]   because you're just good at getting A's.
[00:24:52.200 --> 00:24:54.440]   But no matter how good you are,
[00:24:54.440 --> 00:24:56.040]   no matter how disciplined you are,
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:57.080]   you're not going to do something
[00:24:57.080 --> 00:24:59.640]   that's a continual burden to you for a long time,
[00:24:59.640 --> 00:25:01.800]   because all you need is one excuse to stop it.
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:04.600]   You'll be a good Christian.
[00:25:04.600 --> 00:25:07.240]   You'll be a good, responsible citizen.
[00:25:07.240 --> 00:25:09.160]   You'll be good for a while,
[00:25:09.160 --> 00:25:11.240]   until there's a little excuse.
[00:25:11.240 --> 00:25:14.360]   Something goes wrong, and that's enough.
[00:25:14.360 --> 00:25:15.080]   Ah, forget it!
[00:25:16.520 --> 00:25:18.440]   Because Christ is not your Sabbath.
[00:25:18.440 --> 00:25:21.960]   Because this is not where you come to find rest.
[00:25:21.960 --> 00:25:25.880]   This is not where you come when you are lost.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:29.720]   Christ is not the one that you run to when you are hurt.
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:31.480]   He is not your refuge.
[00:25:31.480 --> 00:25:35.640]   And so everything about Christ has become a burden.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:38.280]   If Jesus is not the source of rest,
[00:25:38.280 --> 00:25:40.280]   then heaven will not be a place of rest.
[00:25:40.280 --> 00:25:43.480]   Because the only reason why heaven is a place of rest
[00:25:43.480 --> 00:25:45.960]   is because the source of rest dwells there.
[00:25:46.600 --> 00:25:49.000]   That's why heaven is heaven.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:51.400]   Heaven isn't heaven because it's nicer,
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:53.400]   and the paint hasn't faded,
[00:25:53.400 --> 00:25:55.320]   and the roads are nicer.
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.400]   Heaven is heaven because that's the dwelling
[00:25:57.400 --> 00:25:58.760]   of the source of rest.
[00:25:58.760 --> 00:25:59.640]   That's where God is.
[00:25:59.640 --> 00:26:01.000]   He entered the Sabbath,
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:02.280]   and that's where we were at,
[00:26:02.280 --> 00:26:04.680]   and that's where Jesus is trying to take us.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:07.560]   And that's why this health and wealth gospel
[00:26:07.560 --> 00:26:12.600]   is so not only deceptive, but destructive.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:15.400]   Because what the health and wealth gospel does,
[00:26:15.400 --> 00:26:20.600]   it takes the reward to be the health and wealth.
[00:26:20.600 --> 00:26:24.920]   And Jesus is only an avenue to get to the health and wealth.
[00:26:24.920 --> 00:26:29.960]   Be careful if you think that
[00:26:29.960 --> 00:26:31.640]   because you're at a Bible-teaching,
[00:26:31.640 --> 00:26:32.760]   gospel-believing church,
[00:26:32.760 --> 00:26:34.040]   that health and wealth gospel
[00:26:34.040 --> 00:26:35.640]   hasn't penetrated into your own hearts.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:39.080]   Because the principles of health and wealth
[00:26:39.080 --> 00:26:42.440]   is always Jesus as an avenue to get somewhere.
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:44.120]   So if I don't appease God,
[00:26:44.120 --> 00:26:45.160]   if I don't do the right thing,
[00:26:45.160 --> 00:26:46.280]   I won't get into the right school.
[00:26:46.280 --> 00:26:47.720]   I won't meet the right wife.
[00:26:47.720 --> 00:26:49.720]   I won't have the right relationship.
[00:26:49.720 --> 00:26:52.680]   And so Jesus is only worshipped
[00:26:52.680 --> 00:26:55.960]   when he's the avenue to get to the health and wealth.
[00:26:55.960 --> 00:26:59.240]   But the teaching of the gospel
[00:26:59.240 --> 00:27:01.720]   is not Jesus is the way to life.
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:03.160]   Jesus is the life.
[00:27:03.160 --> 00:27:06.680]   I am the way and the truth and the life.
[00:27:06.680 --> 00:27:09.480]   He didn't just open the door
[00:27:09.480 --> 00:27:10.840]   and say, "Here's the right way."
[00:27:10.840 --> 00:27:14.120]   He didn't just pave the path for us to go.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:17.480]   He says the end product of this path
[00:27:17.480 --> 00:27:18.440]   is Christ himself.
[00:27:18.440 --> 00:27:20.200]   That's what he means when he says,
[00:27:20.200 --> 00:27:23.000]   "I am the way, I am the truth,
[00:27:23.000 --> 00:27:24.840]   and I am the life."
[00:27:24.840 --> 00:27:29.160]   So the gift of salvation isn't the path.
[00:27:29.160 --> 00:27:32.360]   The gift of salvation is Christ himself
[00:27:32.360 --> 00:27:35.160]   because Christ himself is our rest.
[00:27:35.160 --> 00:27:38.120]   That's why becoming a member of the church
[00:27:38.120 --> 00:27:40.440]   and working hard and being disciplined
[00:27:40.440 --> 00:27:41.640]   and knowing the scripture,
[00:27:41.640 --> 00:27:44.920]   all of this can just produce more burden
[00:27:44.920 --> 00:27:46.920]   if you do not know Christ.
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:49.400]   That's the invitation.
[00:27:49.400 --> 00:27:50.120]   That's why he says,
[00:27:50.120 --> 00:27:53.000]   "Let us fear that we do not enter this rest."
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:58.760]   Ecclesiastes 1, 2-4, 8-10.
[00:27:58.760 --> 00:28:01.720]   It reminds us that every generation
[00:28:01.720 --> 00:28:03.560]   tries to prove the other generation wrong.
[00:28:03.560 --> 00:28:07.960]   Most young people look at the previous generation
[00:28:07.960 --> 00:28:10.200]   and can immediately tell you what they did wrong.
[00:28:11.080 --> 00:28:12.760]   What did the politicians do wrong?
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:14.360]   What did this nation do wrong?
[00:28:14.360 --> 00:28:18.040]   So we can easily see because it's already mapped out.
[00:28:18.040 --> 00:28:20.120]   These are the mistakes that the United States made.
[00:28:20.120 --> 00:28:22.360]   The previous politicians did this.
[00:28:22.360 --> 00:28:24.280]   My mom and my dad, they did this.
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.320]   My grandparents did this.
[00:28:25.320 --> 00:28:27.800]   So when we are older, we're not going to do this.
[00:28:27.800 --> 00:28:29.320]   So every generation thinks
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.640]   that if you just tweak certain things
[00:28:31.640 --> 00:28:33.000]   and did certain things differently,
[00:28:33.000 --> 00:28:35.560]   I'm not going to repeat the same mistakes my parents did.
[00:28:35.560 --> 00:28:38.920]   And they were trying so hard to prove
[00:28:38.920 --> 00:28:40.440]   the previous generation wrong.
[00:28:40.760 --> 00:28:43.720]   But over and over again, history repeats itself.
[00:28:43.720 --> 00:28:45.080]   There's nothing new under the sun.
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.640]   "Vanity of vanity," says the preacher.
[00:28:47.640 --> 00:28:50.200]   "Vanity of vanities, all is vanity.
[00:28:50.200 --> 00:28:52.760]   What advantage does man have in all his work,
[00:28:52.760 --> 00:28:54.280]   which he does under the sun?
[00:28:54.280 --> 00:28:56.840]   A generation goes, a generation comes,
[00:28:56.840 --> 00:28:59.000]   but the earth remains forever."
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:01.640]   You know why he's saying that?
[00:29:01.640 --> 00:29:04.360]   Because rest is not here.
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:08.440]   You're looking in the wrong place to find salvation.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.840]   If you keep looking to this world,
[00:29:12.840 --> 00:29:15.000]   to politics, for money, for family,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:17.560]   for relationships, for communities,
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:19.800]   to look for rest and satisfaction in life,
[00:29:19.800 --> 00:29:21.720]   he says all it does is repeat over again.
[00:29:21.720 --> 00:29:23.320]   The end conclusion is the same.
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:25.800]   Whether it was a thousand years ago,
[00:29:25.800 --> 00:29:28.200]   or whether it's today or a thousand years later,
[00:29:28.200 --> 00:29:30.840]   they come to the same conclusion.
[00:29:30.840 --> 00:29:31.640]   It's not here.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:35.000]   Verse 8, "All things are wearisome.
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:36.360]   Man is not able to tell it.
[00:29:36.360 --> 00:29:38.280]   The eye is not satisfied with seeing
[00:29:38.280 --> 00:29:40.200]   nor is the ear filled with hearing.
[00:29:40.200 --> 00:29:42.600]   That which has been is that which will be,
[00:29:42.600 --> 00:29:45.800]   and that which has been done is that which will be done.
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:48.040]   So there is nothing new under the sun.
[00:29:48.040 --> 00:29:49.720]   Is there anything which one might say,
[00:29:49.720 --> 00:29:51.400]   'See this, it is new already,
[00:29:51.400 --> 00:29:54.760]   it has existed for ages, which were before us.'"
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:58.520]   He says the difference between a Christian and non-Christian
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:01.080]   is that a Christian hears the voice of God,
[00:30:01.080 --> 00:30:05.000]   and he believes, and then so he follows him.
[00:30:05.000 --> 00:30:07.320]   Verse 2, "For indeed we have been
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:09.960]   for indeed we have had good news preached to us,
[00:30:09.960 --> 00:30:12.120]   just as they also, but the word they heard
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:14.680]   did not profit them, because it was not united
[00:30:14.680 --> 00:30:16.600]   by faith in those who heard."
[00:30:16.600 --> 00:30:18.120]   The word of God went out.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:19.640]   The gospel was preached.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:22.280]   The same promise and same warning has gone out,
[00:30:22.280 --> 00:30:24.120]   but the followers of Christ,
[00:30:24.120 --> 00:30:26.280]   and there's those who do not follow Christ,
[00:30:26.280 --> 00:30:29.880]   are the ones who believe and believe and not believe.
[00:30:29.880 --> 00:30:31.880]   And then verse 6, it says,
[00:30:31.880 --> 00:30:34.200]   "Therefore, since it remains for some to enter it,
[00:30:34.200 --> 00:30:36.280]   those who formerly had good news preached them
[00:30:36.280 --> 00:30:38.280]   fail to enter because of disobedience."
[00:30:38.280 --> 00:30:41.720]   Their disbelief resulted in disobedience.
[00:30:41.720 --> 00:30:46.440]   I want to show you guys a video of how they catch monkeys,
[00:30:46.440 --> 00:30:47.720]   but let me set this up, okay?
[00:30:47.720 --> 00:30:49.500]   All right.
[00:30:49.500 --> 00:30:51.240]   You may have seen this before,
[00:30:51.240 --> 00:30:52.280]   because this is an old video.
[00:30:52.280 --> 00:30:56.200]   Where we live, monkeys aren't a problem.
[00:30:56.200 --> 00:30:58.440]   We don't see monkeys out on the street,
[00:30:58.440 --> 00:31:00.520]   but there's certain parts of the world that you travel,
[00:31:00.520 --> 00:31:03.160]   you'll have monkeys climbing on your cars,
[00:31:03.160 --> 00:31:04.920]   and India happens to be one of those places.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:05.580]   Right?
[00:31:05.580 --> 00:31:09.560]   I had a missionary friend who lives in a big city,
[00:31:09.560 --> 00:31:11.720]   and he lives on the 17th floor,
[00:31:11.720 --> 00:31:13.640]   and he says that if he doesn't close his window,
[00:31:13.640 --> 00:31:15.880]   and sometimes he'll go out, come back at night,
[00:31:15.880 --> 00:31:18.920]   that he might sometimes find a monkey in his apartment.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:20.200]   They climb 17 stories,
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.480]   and they come into the apartment complex.
[00:31:23.480 --> 00:31:24.360]   So it's a big issue.
[00:31:24.360 --> 00:31:26.840]   But in India, they don't kill monkeys.
[00:31:26.840 --> 00:31:27.880]   They don't kill anything,
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.800]   because they think it's bad karma.
[00:31:29.800 --> 00:31:31.800]   So this is probably a nuisance
[00:31:31.800 --> 00:31:33.880]   in many other parts of the world,
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:36.280]   and I don't know which nation this is,
[00:31:36.280 --> 00:31:37.400]   but just watch the video.
[00:31:37.400 --> 00:31:38.360]   It's better if you watch it.
[00:31:38.520 --> 00:31:39.320]   Okay.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:40.280]   Oh.
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:45.240]   Then he sort of knows that the room is good.
[00:31:45.240 --> 00:31:49.240]   [inaudible]
[00:31:49.240 --> 00:31:52.040]   The room doesn't look like a human being at all.
[00:31:52.040 --> 00:31:53.880]   So he says, "Cool."
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:57.240]   But he doesn't know what he is in that confounded hole.
[00:31:57.240 --> 00:32:04.440]   Finally, this is the room that can save the democracy.
[00:32:04.440 --> 00:32:06.040]   He doesn't know what's in there.
[00:32:06.040 --> 00:32:35.800]   [video playing]
[00:32:35.800 --> 00:32:37.560]   So in this illustration,
[00:32:37.560 --> 00:32:40.360]   the monkey is the world, right?
[00:32:40.360 --> 00:32:41.560]   The hunter is Satan.
[00:32:41.560 --> 00:32:46.440]   And the seeds is the things that we covet, right?
[00:32:46.440 --> 00:32:48.440]   I don't know where I found this video,
[00:32:48.440 --> 00:32:49.720]   but I saw it years ago.
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:52.760]   So I thought it would be a visual effect, right?
[00:32:52.760 --> 00:32:54.920]   So he says, "The difference between a Christian
[00:32:54.920 --> 00:32:57.000]   and a non-Christian is a Christian is an individual.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:01.400]   The whole world obviously needs to eat, right?
[00:33:01.400 --> 00:33:03.320]   If you're a hungry monkey, why not get it?"
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:06.200]   The problem was not that he went to get it,
[00:33:06.200 --> 00:33:08.360]   but then once he got enticed, he couldn't let go,
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:09.880]   even though he saw the danger coming.
[00:33:09.880 --> 00:33:12.360]   A difference between a Christian and non-Christian,
[00:33:12.360 --> 00:33:14.600]   the Bible says, "My sheep, they hear my voice,
[00:33:14.600 --> 00:33:16.680]   and they follow me."
[00:33:16.680 --> 00:33:20.360]   And the voice of the master says, "Let go."
[00:33:20.360 --> 00:33:24.760]   He says, "He who finds his life will lose it."
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:27.480]   Because the whole reason why that monkey is holding on to that
[00:33:27.480 --> 00:33:29.080]   is because he wants to eat to live.
[00:33:29.080 --> 00:33:32.760]   But he's deceived to think that the only way to live
[00:33:32.760 --> 00:33:34.600]   is this thing, and if he lets go,
[00:33:34.600 --> 00:33:35.960]   he might not be able to live.
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:37.400]   And he hears his master's voice,
[00:33:37.400 --> 00:33:38.760]   and the master's voice says, "No!
[00:33:38.760 --> 00:33:41.560]   If you do not let go, you will die."
[00:33:41.560 --> 00:33:45.000]   And so the ones who believe in Christ
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:47.000]   are the ones who hear the voice,
[00:33:47.000 --> 00:33:48.040]   they believe him.
[00:33:48.040 --> 00:33:50.280]   They believe him.
[00:33:50.280 --> 00:33:53.640]   So they choose to obey the master's voice,
[00:33:53.640 --> 00:33:57.320]   and he lets go, which frees him from that trap
[00:33:57.320 --> 00:33:59.960]   to follow his master to eternal life.
[00:34:01.160 --> 00:34:02.200]   But an unbeliever,
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:04.920]   no matter what he confesses with his mouth,
[00:34:04.920 --> 00:34:07.400]   he hears the voice,
[00:34:07.400 --> 00:34:09.640]   but he does not believe that that's where life is.
[00:34:09.640 --> 00:34:11.960]   Even though he may profess it,
[00:34:11.960 --> 00:34:13.720]   even though he may come to church,
[00:34:13.720 --> 00:34:16.200]   he does not believe, so he cannot let go.
[00:34:16.200 --> 00:34:19.800]   And so as long as he is holding on,
[00:34:19.800 --> 00:34:20.760]   he is trapped.
[00:34:20.760 --> 00:34:24.440]   When the author of Hebrews is warning,
[00:34:24.440 --> 00:34:27.560]   "Let us fear that we do not fall short
[00:34:27.560 --> 00:34:29.080]   of entering this rest,"
[00:34:29.080 --> 00:34:31.320]   is that warning.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:33.480]   If you do not let go,
[00:34:33.480 --> 00:34:35.000]   if you do not trust my voice,
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:38.200]   and you keep holding on to what you covet,
[00:34:38.200 --> 00:34:41.480]   you do not know that your profession
[00:34:41.480 --> 00:34:43.720]   and your action betray you.
[00:34:43.720 --> 00:34:48.680]   My sheep, they will hear my voice.
[00:34:48.680 --> 00:34:52.120]   John 5, 23 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:34:52.120 --> 00:34:55.080]   he who hears my word and believes him who sent me
[00:34:55.080 --> 00:34:57.480]   has eternal life and does not come into judgment,
[00:34:57.480 --> 00:35:00.200]   but has passed out of death into life."
[00:35:00.200 --> 00:35:02.360]   That was the sin of Eve.
[00:35:02.360 --> 00:35:04.840]   God told them, "If you eat of this tree
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:06.600]   of knowledge of good and evil,
[00:35:06.600 --> 00:35:07.480]   you shall surely die."
[00:35:07.480 --> 00:35:10.120]   But Satan came and said, "Shall you really die?"
[00:35:10.120 --> 00:35:15.320]   And Eve decided to believe Satan's words
[00:35:15.320 --> 00:35:19.560]   and disobeyed instead of believing God.
[00:35:19.560 --> 00:35:22.920]   And that's the distinction between a believer
[00:35:22.920 --> 00:35:25.160]   and unbeliever, is what you believe.
[00:35:26.200 --> 00:35:27.720]   And that's why I go back to verse 1,
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:31.400]   it says, "Let us fear, considering the consequence."
[00:35:31.400 --> 00:35:34.920]   Considering the consequences of just drifting
[00:35:34.920 --> 00:35:36.120]   and becoming apostate
[00:35:36.120 --> 00:35:39.000]   and having our hearts so hardened.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:42.680]   We can't stand to hear the truth after a while
[00:35:42.680 --> 00:35:44.680]   because Christ has become a burden to us.
[00:35:44.680 --> 00:35:47.000]   And we're living on the edge,
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:49.560]   and any little pin that drops
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:53.080]   to hinder the comfort that we have,
[00:35:53.080 --> 00:35:54.200]   we think we have created,
[00:35:55.160 --> 00:35:55.880]   we go off.
[00:35:55.880 --> 00:35:58.440]   Let us fear.
[00:35:58.440 --> 00:36:02.200]   Those who fear will have nothing to fear.
[00:36:02.200 --> 00:36:04.360]   An unbeliever will hear the warning,
[00:36:04.360 --> 00:36:05.720]   but it's not going to sound like warning
[00:36:05.720 --> 00:36:07.400]   because he doesn't know the danger that's coming.
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:09.960]   An unbeliever doesn't believe the warning.
[00:36:09.960 --> 00:36:12.200]   So you can say, "Let us fear,"
[00:36:12.200 --> 00:36:13.240]   but an unbeliever,
[00:36:13.240 --> 00:36:15.080]   it will not produce any fear in that person.
[00:36:15.080 --> 00:36:18.840]   An unbeliever doesn't believe anything you say.
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:21.480]   But a child of God,
[00:36:21.480 --> 00:36:23.160]   you give the warning,
[00:36:23.160 --> 00:36:24.120]   and the warning is not given
[00:36:24.120 --> 00:36:25.160]   to a bunch of unbelievers,
[00:36:25.160 --> 00:36:26.200]   it's given to the church.
[00:36:26.200 --> 00:36:29.480]   A child of God who recognizes
[00:36:29.480 --> 00:36:30.760]   and believes in eternity,
[00:36:30.760 --> 00:36:31.480]   spiritual things,
[00:36:31.480 --> 00:36:32.920]   and what Christ has done,
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:34.920]   and says, "I'm warning you.
[00:36:34.920 --> 00:36:37.640]   If you keep going down this path,
[00:36:37.640 --> 00:36:40.760]   there is judgment coming."
[00:36:40.760 --> 00:36:44.120]   Only a believer will be in fear.
[00:36:44.120 --> 00:36:47.720]   Those who fear will have nothing to fear.
[00:36:47.720 --> 00:36:51.160]   Those who have no fear while slipping
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:53.560]   will end up with much greater fear.
[00:36:54.520 --> 00:36:55.960]   Romans 3, 17, 18,
[00:36:55.960 --> 00:36:58.360]   "In the path of peace they have not known,
[00:36:58.360 --> 00:37:01.480]   there is no fear of God before their eyes."
[00:37:01.480 --> 00:37:04.840]   But if you notice this passage,
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.000]   even though it is given in warning,
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.880]   you see God's patience and grace
[00:37:09.880 --> 00:37:10.680]   in that same text.
[00:37:10.680 --> 00:37:13.080]   "Let us fear while the promise remains
[00:37:13.080 --> 00:37:14.440]   of entering his rest."
[00:37:14.440 --> 00:37:16.920]   While the promise of entering his rest.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:18.360]   The whole reason why
[00:37:18.360 --> 00:37:20.280]   the promise of entering his rest is still here
[00:37:20.280 --> 00:37:21.560]   is because God's being patient.
[00:37:22.920 --> 00:37:24.680]   If God wasn't being patient,
[00:37:24.680 --> 00:37:26.280]   he wouldn't have to give warning.
[00:37:26.280 --> 00:37:27.080]   He would just strike.
[00:37:27.080 --> 00:37:30.200]   If God was done with us,
[00:37:30.200 --> 00:37:31.880]   all he would have to do
[00:37:31.880 --> 00:37:34.040]   is just wipe off the dust and just move on.
[00:37:34.040 --> 00:37:38.200]   Why go through the drama of warning,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:39.320]   of preaching,
[00:37:39.320 --> 00:37:40.600]   bring it to repentance?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:41.880]   It's the kindness of God
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:43.240]   that leads us to repentance.
[00:37:43.240 --> 00:37:44.680]   So even the hard preaching,
[00:37:44.680 --> 00:37:47.640]   even the warnings about judgment and hell,
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.240]   it's because God is being kind.
[00:37:49.240 --> 00:37:51.480]   He's being patient.
[00:37:52.120 --> 00:37:53.320]   He says in verse 8,
[00:37:53.320 --> 00:37:55.400]   "For if Joshua had given them rest,
[00:37:55.400 --> 00:37:58.040]   he would not have spoken of another day after that."
[00:37:58.040 --> 00:38:00.280]   So there remains a Sabbath rest
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:01.960]   for the people of God.
[00:38:01.960 --> 00:38:02.840]   People are asking,
[00:38:02.840 --> 00:38:04.360]   even in the first century,
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:05.480]   why doesn't he come?
[00:38:05.480 --> 00:38:08.280]   Peter answers them in 2 Peter 3.9,
[00:38:08.280 --> 00:38:09.800]   "The Lord is not slow about his promise,
[00:38:09.800 --> 00:38:11.240]   but at some counts slowness,
[00:38:11.240 --> 00:38:12.840]   but is patient towards you,
[00:38:12.840 --> 00:38:15.000]   not wishing for any to perish,
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:16.920]   but for all to come to repentance."
[00:38:16.920 --> 00:38:19.640]   The reason why Jesus hasn't come in 2000 years
[00:38:19.640 --> 00:38:21.400]   is because he's been patient
[00:38:21.400 --> 00:38:23.000]   and he is patiently waiting
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:24.120]   for the sinners to repent,
[00:38:24.120 --> 00:38:27.400]   for his children to hear his voice to come.
[00:38:27.400 --> 00:38:29.240]   And so we are in a period
[00:38:29.240 --> 00:38:31.160]   where the promise still remains,
[00:38:31.160 --> 00:38:34.280]   where there's opportunity still to repent,
[00:38:34.280 --> 00:38:36.840]   where God is still waiting for us
[00:38:36.840 --> 00:38:38.280]   to let go and come to him.
[00:38:38.280 --> 00:38:40.600]   But there will come a day
[00:38:40.600 --> 00:38:43.560]   when that promise is going to be done.
[00:38:43.560 --> 00:38:46.840]   And when the white throne judgment comes,
[00:38:46.840 --> 00:38:47.800]   there is no pleading,
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:48.760]   there is no warning,
[00:38:48.760 --> 00:38:50.680]   there is no waiting,
[00:38:51.400 --> 00:38:52.280]   because it is done.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:55.720]   And when he wipes his feet
[00:38:55.720 --> 00:38:57.160]   from the dust of the sinners,
[00:38:57.160 --> 00:39:00.360]   there is no waiting after that.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:02.840]   You and I are not in that period.
[00:39:02.840 --> 00:39:05.640]   You and I are in the period of grace
[00:39:05.640 --> 00:39:07.320]   that even in strong preaching,
[00:39:07.320 --> 00:39:08.360]   even in warning,
[00:39:08.360 --> 00:39:13.240]   God is patiently, patiently, patiently
[00:39:13.240 --> 00:39:13.960]   waiting for us.
[00:39:13.960 --> 00:39:15.640]   That's why he says,
[00:39:15.640 --> 00:39:17.320]   "Today, if you hear his voice,
[00:39:17.320 --> 00:39:20.200]   recognize it's the grace of God.
[00:39:20.200 --> 00:39:21.240]   If you've been praying,
[00:39:21.240 --> 00:39:22.280]   'God, where are you?
[00:39:22.280 --> 00:39:23.960]   I don't know you.
[00:39:23.960 --> 00:39:25.480]   I don't see you.'
[00:39:25.480 --> 00:39:27.320]   The fact that you hear his voice,
[00:39:27.320 --> 00:39:30.200]   the fact that you understand
[00:39:30.200 --> 00:39:31.400]   what is in the scripture,
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:34.600]   that's evidence of his presence in your life.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:36.440]   Because if God was not present in your life,
[00:39:36.440 --> 00:39:37.800]   you wouldn't understand what I'm saying.
[00:39:37.800 --> 00:39:39.960]   You probably think you're sitting there
[00:39:39.960 --> 00:39:40.760]   just sick and tired.
[00:39:40.760 --> 00:39:41.960]   Just get over with it.
[00:39:41.960 --> 00:39:44.840]   But the fact that your heart is softened
[00:39:44.840 --> 00:39:46.920]   and the word of God is penetrating your heart
[00:39:46.920 --> 00:39:48.280]   is because the Lord is near.
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:51.880]   While it is still called today,
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:54.280]   do not harden your heart
[00:39:54.280 --> 00:39:56.680]   because tomorrow it may not be there.
[00:39:56.680 --> 00:39:59.320]   In Isaiah 55, 1 to 3,
[00:39:59.320 --> 00:40:01.960]   "Ho, everyone who thirsts,
[00:40:01.960 --> 00:40:03.080]   come to the waters.
[00:40:03.080 --> 00:40:04.760]   And you who have no money,
[00:40:04.760 --> 00:40:06.840]   come, buy and eat.
[00:40:06.840 --> 00:40:08.600]   Come, buy wine and milk
[00:40:08.600 --> 00:40:10.280]   without money and without cost.
[00:40:10.280 --> 00:40:11.560]   Why do you spend money for that
[00:40:11.560 --> 00:40:13.720]   for what is not bread
[00:40:13.720 --> 00:40:15.800]   and your wages for what does not satisfy?
[00:40:15.800 --> 00:40:17.960]   Listen carefully to me
[00:40:17.960 --> 00:40:19.640]   and eat what is good.
[00:40:20.040 --> 00:40:22.360]   And delight yourself in abundance.
[00:40:22.360 --> 00:40:24.920]   Incline your ear and come to me.
[00:40:24.920 --> 00:40:26.440]   Listen that you may live
[00:40:26.440 --> 00:40:29.160]   and I may make an everlasting covenant with you
[00:40:29.160 --> 00:40:32.120]   according to the faithful mercies shown to David."
[00:40:32.120 --> 00:40:32.840]   All that has happened,
[00:40:32.840 --> 00:40:35.880]   all of it is to bring us to Christ.
[00:40:35.880 --> 00:40:38.440]   And finally, in Revelation 22, 17,
[00:40:38.440 --> 00:40:41.240]   God ends the book of Revelation with a plea.
[00:40:41.240 --> 00:40:42.600]   The Spirit of the bride says,
[00:40:42.600 --> 00:40:45.800]   "Come and let the one who hears say, come.
[00:40:45.800 --> 00:40:48.280]   Let the one who is thirsty come.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:50.440]   Let the one who wishes
[00:40:50.440 --> 00:40:53.000]   take the water of life without cost."
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:56.120]   Where do you find rest?
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:00.440]   Physically, we know what to do.
[00:41:00.440 --> 00:41:02.360]   Stop working so hard.
[00:41:02.360 --> 00:41:03.000]   Take a nap.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:04.440]   Take a vacation.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.160]   What do you do with the restlessness of your soul,
[00:41:07.160 --> 00:41:08.840]   of your heart?
[00:41:08.840 --> 00:41:11.640]   Where do you go for that?
[00:41:11.640 --> 00:41:14.760]   Do you believe that Christ
[00:41:14.760 --> 00:41:17.160]   is the only one who can give you this rest?
[00:41:18.120 --> 00:41:19.160]   Have you been looking for this
[00:41:19.160 --> 00:41:21.000]   in other places and other things?
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:23.000]   Have you been seeking rest spiritually
[00:41:23.000 --> 00:41:24.760]   by resting physically?
[00:41:24.760 --> 00:41:27.160]   Has Christ become a burden
[00:41:27.160 --> 00:41:29.560]   or is he truly your life?
[00:41:29.560 --> 00:41:32.840]   The whole reason why we have the communion table
[00:41:32.840 --> 00:41:33.720]   is to remind us.
[00:41:33.720 --> 00:41:36.360]   It has to do this in remembrance of me,
[00:41:36.360 --> 00:41:38.440]   that we may remember
[00:41:38.440 --> 00:41:40.920]   that this is the yoke that he bore on our behalf.
[00:41:40.920 --> 00:41:44.120]   "Come to me all who are weary and heavy laden
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:45.640]   and I will give you rest.
[00:41:45.640 --> 00:41:48.680]   Take my yoke upon you and learn from me
[00:41:48.680 --> 00:41:51.000]   for I am gentle and humble in heart
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:53.240]   and you shall find rest for your souls."
[00:41:53.240 --> 00:41:56.600]   So I pray today as we participate in the communion
[00:41:56.600 --> 00:41:59.320]   that we would truly find rest in Christ.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:03.080]   Repent of whatever it is that caused us
[00:42:03.080 --> 00:42:04.600]   to drift away from God,
[00:42:04.600 --> 00:42:06.840]   hardened hearts, disobedient life,
[00:42:06.840 --> 00:42:11.000]   that we may hear his voice of our master
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:11.800]   and follow him.
[00:42:11.800 --> 00:42:14.600]   So today I ask you if you are a baptized believer
[00:42:14.600 --> 00:42:17.000]   to come to the middle when you are ready,
[00:42:17.000 --> 00:42:20.360]   come to these aisles and use this middle aisle to exit.
[00:42:20.360 --> 00:42:23.240]   If you are not baptized and you're here as a guest,
[00:42:23.240 --> 00:42:25.240]   we ask that you would stay in your seat.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:28.120]   There is no superpower in these communion elements
[00:42:28.120 --> 00:42:29.080]   just because you take it,
[00:42:29.080 --> 00:42:31.640]   only if there is genuine faith of repentance.
[00:42:31.640 --> 00:42:34.600]   And so we ask that you would stay in your seats
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:35.800]   and just contemplate and think
[00:42:35.800 --> 00:42:38.040]   if any part of the message made any sense to you.
[00:42:38.040 --> 00:42:41.640]   You don't need to come through a pastor or any leader,
[00:42:41.640 --> 00:42:43.880]   just come before God and honestly confess,
[00:42:43.880 --> 00:42:47.480]   "Lord, if you're real, open my ears that I may hear you,
[00:42:47.480 --> 00:42:48.360]   that I may see you."
[00:42:48.360 --> 00:42:51.400]   If you have questions that you want answered,
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:55.480]   you can come to the leaders or anybody at the church.
[00:42:55.480 --> 00:42:56.920]   It would be more than wanting to sit down with you
[00:42:56.920 --> 00:42:59.320]   and try to answer some of the questions for you.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.760]   But otherwise, for the communion table,
[00:43:00.760 --> 00:43:02.680]   we ask that you would remain seated until we're done.
[00:43:02.680 --> 00:43:09.000]   In 1 Corinthians 11.23,
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:17.000]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.920]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread.
[00:43:20.920 --> 00:43:23.640]   And when he had given things, he broke it and said,
[00:43:23.640 --> 00:43:25.800]   'This is my body, which is for you.
[00:43:25.800 --> 00:43:27.160]   Do this in remembrance of me.'
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:31.160]   In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[00:43:31.160 --> 00:43:33.880]   saying, 'This cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[00:43:33.880 --> 00:43:36.840]   Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[00:43:36.840 --> 00:43:39.320]   For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[00:43:39.320 --> 00:43:41.960]   you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.'"
[00:43:41.960 --> 00:43:44.760]   So let me pray for us and open up the communion table.
[00:43:44.760 --> 00:43:47.320]   And again, when you are ready, one by one, please come up.
[00:43:47.320 --> 00:43:47.880]   Let's pray.
[00:43:47.880 --> 00:43:52.920]   Gracious Father, we thank you.
[00:43:52.920 --> 00:43:57.080]   We thank you for sending your only begotten son to die for our sins.
[00:43:57.080 --> 00:44:04.280]   We thank you, Father God, that you've given your son's work on our behalf,
[00:44:04.280 --> 00:44:05.880]   that our sins may be atoned for.
[00:44:06.840 --> 00:44:10.920]   That we know that it's not by our hard work, but it's simply by your grace
[00:44:10.920 --> 00:44:15.800]   and our faith in that grace that causes us to enter into that rest.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:19.880]   I pray that you would help us to know,
[00:44:19.880 --> 00:44:23.160]   not just in theory, but in practice and fruit,
[00:44:23.160 --> 00:44:26.280]   what it means to truly be in your Sabbath.
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:32.120]   Help us, Lord God, this morning as we participate in this sacred event,
[00:44:33.640 --> 00:44:38.680]   that we would truly be refreshed, renewed, and re-strengthened,
[00:44:38.680 --> 00:44:41.320]   that we may truly worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:44:41.320 --> 00:44:43.000]   We ask for your blessing over this time.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:45.160]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
