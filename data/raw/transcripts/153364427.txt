[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.680]   I have two parts to this. One is, again, because it's a general review and we're going over
[00:00:09.680 --> 00:00:17.280]   19 chapters, so we're not, we're just, all we're going to be doing is going over just
[00:00:17.280 --> 00:00:24.080]   kind of like the broad outline. Is this too loud? Yeah, broad outline of the 19, actually,
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:32.080]   technically it's going to be up to 23 chapters. And then after that portion, we're going to
[00:00:32.080 --> 00:00:36.400]   have, we're going to play some games, okay? Well, it's actually not a game. I'm just going
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:43.640]   to ask you a question, you're going to answer, okay? It is a game. It's going to be no-frills
[00:00:43.640 --> 00:00:47.360]   game. So basically what's going to happen is, I'm going to tally up the points. So it's
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.400]   going to be based on the outline that I gave you. We're going to be going over the outline.
[00:00:52.400 --> 00:00:55.440]   You're going to have the fill-ins. I'm going to go over the outline. And then the questions
[00:00:55.440 --> 00:01:00.920]   that I'm going to be asking you is going to be related, mostly related to the outline.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:06.800]   The reason why I wanted to do this is kind of to reemphasize twice, and then I'll give
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:13.200]   you time to discuss and think through. So the goal of the review is not so that you
[00:01:13.200 --> 00:01:19.320]   can like know here's the flow and know all the details of each chapter. So at the minimum,
[00:01:19.320 --> 00:01:25.040]   you can see the broad outline. And then if I said chapter 3, you know, you kind of know
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:30.040]   what's going on in chapter 3. If I said chapter 13, you kind of know what's going on in chapter
[00:01:30.040 --> 00:01:35.400]   13. And then all the major prophesies, messianic prophecies, that you kind of know where it
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:40.840]   is. So that when you think of the book of Isaiah, at least for the first 23 chapters,
[00:01:40.840 --> 00:01:45.840]   you'll have a broad outline that's memorized in your head. So that's the goal today, okay?
[00:01:45.840 --> 00:01:50.080]   So we're not going to get into too much detail today because again, the purpose of this is
[00:01:50.080 --> 00:01:56.520]   to ingrain in you the outline of the book of Isaiah that we're up to. Okay?
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:02:05.640]   All right, so do you have any leftover on tables, anybody? You know, I forgot to email
[00:02:05.640 --> 00:02:19.200]   again. So if you need more, raise your hand. If you have more at your table, raise your
[00:02:19.200 --> 00:02:42.920]   hand. Okay. Okay. So just to kind of give you, if you look at the outline, you'll see
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:51.040]   that there's A, B, and C. A, B, C. And so up to chapter 23, it's broken down into three
[00:02:51.040 --> 00:03:00.840]   large, okay, thematic. It doesn't fit perfectly, but I think for the purpose of your memorization.
[00:03:00.840 --> 00:03:08.480]   So if you look at the first one, let me see. Somebody at this table, can you read A for
[00:03:08.480 --> 00:03:22.640]   us? Johnny? Okay. So that's chapter one through six is about the description of Israel's rebellion
[00:03:22.640 --> 00:03:29.880]   and God's restoration. Okay? And then so the six chapters broadly fit under that topic.
[00:03:29.880 --> 00:03:44.480]   Chapter B, if I can have Jonas. Okay. So again, not every single chapter may fall under that,
[00:03:44.480 --> 00:03:49.280]   but from chapter seven through chapter 12 is promise of deliverance for God's remnant.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:55.560]   Okay? And then C, God's judgment of the nations. So I only have up to chapter 20 because that's
[00:03:55.560 --> 00:04:02.120]   all we covered, but that theme actually takes us all the way to chapter 23. Okay? So let's
[00:04:02.120 --> 00:04:14.160]   just think in our heads, even before we start. Chapter one through six is. All right, exactly.
[00:04:14.160 --> 00:04:23.440]   Okay. One more time. Chapter one through six, Israel's rebellion against God and plan of
[00:04:23.440 --> 00:04:29.920]   restoration. That's one through six. Okay. Chapter seven through 12, promise of deliverance
[00:04:29.920 --> 00:04:36.880]   of God's remnant. Okay. So it's pretty easy. You got, you got 12 chapters already. Right?
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:42.320]   And then the last part of it from chapter 13 to 23 is God's judgment to the nation.
[00:04:42.320 --> 00:04:48.120]   All right. Review done. Right? So that's, so I, what I want you to remember at least
[00:04:48.120 --> 00:05:05.960]   is that three large, you know, themes. First theme, don't look at it this time. All right.
[00:05:05.960 --> 00:05:22.000]   Israel's rebellion against God and God's plan for restoration. B. So it'd be a choir to
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.640]   be like. All right. And then third is God's judgment of the nations. Okay. So that's a
[00:05:28.640 --> 00:05:34.080]   broad outline. So what we're going to be talking about is filling the details of what's happening.
[00:05:34.080 --> 00:05:38.800]   So I want you to pay attention to, to the outline. Try to memorize it as much as you
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:43.920]   can, because after I'm done reviewing or going over it, we're going to, I'm going to be asking
[00:05:43.920 --> 00:05:47.400]   questions. And the questions I'm going to be asking is, I'm going to give you a verse.
[00:05:47.400 --> 00:05:51.360]   I'm going to ask you what chapter that's in. Okay. And then I'm going to have you guys
[00:05:51.360 --> 00:05:56.500]   raise hand, tell me what chapter that's in. And the verses are kind of taken out based
[00:05:56.500 --> 00:06:03.560]   upon the themes in here. Okay. So if you know the theme well, when the, when the verse comes
[00:06:03.560 --> 00:06:09.400]   up, it'll be easier for you to raise your hand. And if your table wins, we'll have a
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:18.440]   gift card for you to go out and eat with your table. Okay. With your table. All right. So
[00:06:18.440 --> 00:06:29.180]   15 bucks, dollar per person. All right. No, I was just kidding. A real, real meal for
[00:06:29.180 --> 00:06:33.760]   your small group. Okay. But it has to be, you can't deviate up. You have to go with
[00:06:33.760 --> 00:06:42.920]   your small group. Okay. All right. Let's begin. Oops, sorry. Okay. This is just kind of a,
[00:06:42.920 --> 00:06:52.080]   before we get into it, just a quick review of Israel's history. Okay. Just, just remember,
[00:06:52.080 --> 00:06:56.040]   I know a lot of you guys already know this, but just Israel's history, it begins with
[00:06:56.040 --> 00:07:01.720]   Saul. Saul's the first King of Israel. His son is David. David's son is Solomon. And
[00:07:01.720 --> 00:07:09.640]   then Solomon's child, Rehoboam, right? So after he dies, Rehoboam is the rightful successor
[00:07:09.640 --> 00:07:16.480]   of the, of the throne. But what ends up happening is Rehoboam decides that he's going to, he's
[00:07:16.480 --> 00:07:22.480]   going to cause them to pay heavy tax. And so the nation of Israel gets angry and Jeroboam
[00:07:22.480 --> 00:07:27.520]   leads the rebellion against Israel and he takes 10 of the tribes and then he goes up
[00:07:27.520 --> 00:07:32.480]   north. And so the kingdom splits in half. So the two tribes, tribe of Judah, tribe of
[00:07:32.480 --> 00:07:38.480]   Benjamin stays with Rehoboam. So even though neither of them are righteous, right? This
[00:07:38.480 --> 00:07:45.880]   split happens, humanly speaking, because Rehoboam chooses to, you know, take advantage of the
[00:07:45.880 --> 00:07:50.600]   people and these people take off. So ever since then, ever since this happens, there's
[00:07:50.600 --> 00:07:57.960]   two kingdoms that split, right? And so this kingdom, it keeps, it keeps going. This is
[00:07:57.960 --> 00:08:05.120]   the kingdom that we call the, the Northern Kingdom. They have 10 tribes. They're the
[00:08:05.120 --> 00:08:11.840]   ones who fall into captivity, but to the Assyrians first, right? And then later on the Babylonians
[00:08:11.840 --> 00:08:20.960]   take the Southern Kingdom. Okay. When does the prophecy of Isaiah take place? Has any
[00:08:20.960 --> 00:08:28.040]   of these kingdoms fallen yet? Not yet. These guys are about to fall. They didn't fall yet.
[00:08:28.040 --> 00:08:34.880]   So he is prophesying during this period to the Southern Kingdom and he's prophesying
[00:08:34.880 --> 00:08:39.240]   about what's happening with these guys, but then, but he's also saying that this is the
[00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:44.640]   same thing is going to happen to you. Okay. So that's the background behind Isaiah's prophecy.
[00:08:44.640 --> 00:08:51.640]   Okay. Yes. All right. So just, just kind of give you a heads up on a quick history of
[00:08:51.640 --> 00:08:59.520]   game. Israel is right here, Jerusalem. So the Northern Kingdom possesses Jerusalem.
[00:08:59.520 --> 00:09:03.720]   I'll start with this. Southern Kingdom possesses Jerusalem, this area. Northern Kingdom splits
[00:09:03.720 --> 00:09:09.360]   and then they end up going into this area. Okay. So this here together is Israel, but
[00:09:09.360 --> 00:09:14.680]   the Southern Kingdom is located down here and then the Northern Kingdom is up here.
[00:09:14.680 --> 00:09:22.400]   Okay. Now so much of Israel's history is about their interaction with three major kingdoms.
[00:09:22.400 --> 00:09:28.360]   You have the Egyptians down here and you have the Assyrians and the Babylonians are at the
[00:09:28.360 --> 00:09:34.560]   time that, that Isaiah is prophesying Babylon, Babylon has not taken over this yet. So Assyria
[00:09:34.560 --> 00:09:39.000]   is here. Babylon is in the outer sides of over here. Eventually they're going to conquer
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:45.600]   Assyria and then this is going to be the Babylonian kingdom. Okay. Eventually. Right. So Isaiah
[00:09:45.600 --> 00:09:51.080]   is prophesying during this period where if they, if Israel wanted to survive, humanly
[00:09:51.080 --> 00:09:57.240]   speaking, they have to attach themselves with one of these kingdoms. So in order to protect
[00:09:57.240 --> 00:10:02.000]   themselves from Assyria, sometimes they would pay tribute to Babylon, right? Or sometimes
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:07.800]   they will pay tribute to the Egypt or Cush. So different nations hoping that if we ally
[00:10:07.800 --> 00:10:12.680]   with them, that they're going to help us. And so a lot of God's prophecies in book of
[00:10:12.680 --> 00:10:17.760]   Isaiah is telling them that you think you're safe because you have some sort of alliance
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.480]   with the Babylonians, but in the end they're also going to be humbled. They're also going
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:25.760]   to be judged, right? That your hope is placed in the wrong place. You should have hoped
[00:10:25.760 --> 00:10:32.000]   in God and not these people. So a lot of Isaiah's prophecies is about them jockeying position
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:40.800]   and putting their trust in these foreign nations. Okay. All right. That's a brief background.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:47.640]   So let's go. Um, a Israel's rebellion against God and his plan of restoration. So chapter
[00:10:47.640 --> 00:10:53.360]   one, if you remember Israel's sin of not recognizing their master, remember the, the verse here
[00:10:53.360 --> 00:11:00.160]   that donkeys, the animals recognize their master, but Israel does not. Right? So it
[00:11:00.160 --> 00:11:05.760]   begins as an indictment. So that it's kind of like a courtroom where the lawyer is standing.
[00:11:05.760 --> 00:11:09.080]   Isaiah is kind of like the lawyer standing, indicting the nation of Israel. This is, this
[00:11:09.080 --> 00:11:15.960]   is your sin and here's how you sinned against God. Right? And that's basically chapter one.
[00:11:15.960 --> 00:11:21.120]   Within that chapter, remember we talked about false religion, like all your temple worship
[00:11:21.120 --> 00:11:26.960]   sacrifices. They're meaningless to me because why, why were they meaningless? They were
[00:11:26.960 --> 00:11:30.880]   trying to appease God with their false religion. They're rebelling against God in every other
[00:11:30.880 --> 00:11:35.560]   area, but they thought if they came to the temple and gave sacrifices, that somehow that
[00:11:35.560 --> 00:11:39.520]   was going to make up for what they were doing outside of the temple. But God saying that
[00:11:39.520 --> 00:11:47.200]   false religion is not going to have any effect on God. In fact, it's angering God. And then
[00:11:47.200 --> 00:11:53.920]   it, if you notice in your outline, you'll see indentations on some of these, right?
[00:11:53.920 --> 00:11:59.040]   You have ABCD and then you have some indention that says, I, you know, one or two, all the
[00:11:59.040 --> 00:12:04.920]   indentations I indented it because those are where God breaks in in the midst of prophesying
[00:12:04.920 --> 00:12:08.560]   judgment. He breaks in and says, but God's not going to be angry forever. And then he
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:14.480]   talks about restoration. So all the indentation is where God breaks in and says, he's, he's
[00:12:14.480 --> 00:12:21.280]   going to one day forget that and he's going to forget. Okay. So again, we're still in
[00:12:21.280 --> 00:12:26.400]   chapter one, 21 to 31, the fall and restoration of God's righteous city. Obviously he's referencing
[00:12:26.400 --> 00:12:32.440]   Jerusalem, the restoration of the mountain of God, Zion, which all throughout the Bible
[00:12:32.440 --> 00:12:39.880]   is used as a place where God dwells. And then he says, your trust and riches and foreign
[00:12:39.880 --> 00:12:43.920]   powers will fail you because they will be judged. So as we're going through it, if you
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:48.840]   have your Bibles, I encourage you guys to open your, keep your Bibles open and flip
[00:12:48.840 --> 00:12:54.040]   through it. Okay. So if you have your Bibles, just flip through it as we're going through
[00:12:54.040 --> 00:12:59.400]   it, as you see this and filling it in, just take a quick glance so that you'll know what
[00:12:59.400 --> 00:13:11.080]   we're talking about. Cause we're not, we're not going to jump into the details. F, God
[00:13:11.080 --> 00:13:18.920]   will take away our self-confidence and supply soldiers, leaders, and beauty. Right? Remember
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.440]   we talked about that, how they're, they feel like their safety is going to be in aligning
[00:13:23.440 --> 00:13:27.640]   with the right people or they have the right leaders or, you know, it talks about at the
[00:13:27.640 --> 00:13:32.760]   end of chapter three, about the reliance and the beauty and how God's going to come and
[00:13:32.760 --> 00:13:38.200]   take away all of that, all the superficial things that, that you're depending on again.
[00:13:38.200 --> 00:13:43.480]   So here's the first break in, in chapter four, two to six talks about the branch of the Lord.
[00:13:43.480 --> 00:13:50.000]   Right? Remember how God's going to wipe them out. It's only going to leave a stump. And
[00:13:50.000 --> 00:13:54.080]   from that stump is going to come the branch of the Lord. It talks about how the branch
[00:13:54.080 --> 00:14:01.840]   of the Lord is going to restore Israel. Right? Chapter five, one through seven, he describes
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.020]   Israel as a vineyard, how he planted and cultivated. And he said, what is it that I have not given
[00:14:07.020 --> 00:14:14.880]   you that you needed and yet you produce unrighteousness. So again, systematically God is indicting
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:21.640]   them. Right? And then the woe statements, chapter five, eight through 30, woe to those
[00:14:21.640 --> 00:14:37.820]   who trust and pursue riches above God. Okay. So after we go through this, and just before
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:41.500]   I get into the second section, I'm going to give you maybe about five, ten minutes just
[00:14:41.500 --> 00:14:47.620]   to kind of go through your, with your small group, review this with them, with your small
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:50.940]   group, and then I'm going to start asking questions and see who raises their hand and
[00:14:50.940 --> 00:14:59.180]   then, and then we'll play games a little bit. Okay. And then chapter six, one through 13
[00:14:59.180 --> 00:15:07.420]   is the famous call of Isaiah. Can you guys see the bottom? You can't see the bottom.
[00:15:07.420 --> 00:15:18.140]   There's nothing I can do. Which part? Which, where do you see up to here? Okay. You don't
[00:15:18.140 --> 00:15:30.620]   see here? Where? Wait, wait, you see up to H but not I? What? Oh, so you don't see this?
[00:15:30.620 --> 00:15:38.940]   Okay. Is it just you or is anybody else having a problem? Oh, okay. All right. It's just
[00:15:38.940 --> 00:15:48.740]   her. Nobody else is complaining but her. All right, Jane. Thanks, Jane. Isaiah's call.
[00:15:48.740 --> 00:15:56.620]   I-S-A-I-A-H-S call. Okay. That's the only one that's that low. Okay. I'm just messing
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:16:05.480]   with you. All right. Second section, B, promise of deliverance for God's remnant. God will
[00:16:05.480 --> 00:16:11.220]   protect Ahaz from Syria. Remember this passage in chapter seven, one through nine, right?
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:16.260]   What happened here? Syria and Ephraim. Ephraim is another name for the Northern Kingdom,
[00:16:16.260 --> 00:16:27.460]   right? So what, what, what does Syria and Ephraim do? They, they came to Ahaz and said,
[00:16:27.460 --> 00:16:33.540]   ally with us so we can fight against Assyria. Ahaz chooses not to and he, he ends up allying
[00:16:33.540 --> 00:16:38.620]   with somebody else and so they get angry and then he, they, they come to attack him. So
[00:16:38.620 --> 00:16:43.500]   it's at that time God sends Isaiah to tell him that, no, you, God's gonna protect you.
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:47.400]   God's not done with you. In fact, they're the ones who are gonna get into trouble, right?
[00:16:47.400 --> 00:16:52.220]   So that's what's happening here. And again, he breaks in in the middle of that and he
[00:16:52.220 --> 00:16:57.940]   says, you know, tell Ahaz that God said this and Ahaz, does he believe it? No, he doesn't
[00:16:57.940 --> 00:17:01.500]   believe it. It's like, oh, how do I, how can I be sure God's gonna do this? And he said,
[00:17:01.500 --> 00:17:07.700]   I'll give you a sign of Emmanuel, right? That he's gonna come through a virgin. And that's
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:15.940]   where the famous, you know, prophecy about the, about Emmanuel. Remember these passages?
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:22.900]   Okay? And then he says, God's going to bring Assyria to bring judgment upon Damascus and
[00:17:22.900 --> 00:17:29.500]   Samaria. Damascus, again, another word for Syria. So Syria and Samaria, right, they're
[00:17:29.500 --> 00:17:34.100]   gonna be judged. God's gonna raise up Assyria and instead of protecting yourself, God's
[00:17:34.100 --> 00:17:41.740]   gonna actually judge you. And again, it breaks in chapter 9, 1 through 7, the promise of
[00:17:41.740 --> 00:17:56.340]   a, promise of a child. Okay. A little bit higher. Okay. Second part. Okay. God's anger
[00:17:56.340 --> 00:18:00.860]   burns against Israel and their leaders for all, remember this phrase? He repeats it about
[00:18:00.860 --> 00:18:05.820]   five, six times. And it's to remind the nation of Israel, even though all this judgment is
[00:18:05.820 --> 00:18:12.100]   coming, that you refuse to return. So therefore, he says, for all, for all his anger has not
[00:18:12.100 --> 00:18:15.700]   turned away and his hand is stretched out. In other words, he's not done with you. The
[00:18:15.700 --> 00:18:20.780]   judgment is gonna, is gonna be much heavier than you think. Right? Because they refuse
[00:18:20.780 --> 00:18:29.620]   to repent. And then again, I remind Assyria is gonna, as God's agent and target, but also
[00:18:29.620 --> 00:18:35.140]   they're going to be the target of God's judgment. Right? So it's not that Assyria was righteous,
[00:18:35.140 --> 00:18:40.780]   they were just used as an instrument. Kind of like Satan. God allows Satan to work, to
[00:18:40.780 --> 00:18:46.540]   bring upon judgment, but ultimately the greatest judgment is reserved for Satan himself. Right?
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:55.420]   And so that's kind of like the argument here in chapter 10. You know, I mean, go back here.
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:00.420]   You know how God uses Assyria and you know, the, one of the arguments that people typically
[00:19:00.420 --> 00:19:06.380]   make about is that right or wrong is based on the fruit. You know, I've heard people
[00:19:06.380 --> 00:19:11.140]   say, oh, they did this or they use this method and look at, look at the result. And a lot
[00:19:11.140 --> 00:19:16.420]   of times we get confused because we say, well, if God is using them to produce something,
[00:19:16.420 --> 00:19:20.380]   it must be from God. Right? That's not the case at all. There's a lot of times where
[00:19:20.380 --> 00:19:25.420]   God would use agents like Assyria or Babylon and just because it produces fruit doesn't
[00:19:25.420 --> 00:19:30.700]   mean that God, God favors that. It just means that God is using them. Right? God can use
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:37.500]   donkeys, he can use rocks. So Assyria is a good example of a nation where God uses, but
[00:19:37.500 --> 00:19:43.300]   it wasn't because God favored them. Right? And again, a remnant of Israel will return
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:55.580]   to Jerusalem in chapter 10, 20 to 34. And again, the promise of the branch of Israel
[00:19:55.580 --> 00:20:13.540]   coming from the stump. All right. So this part we're going to go over pretty quick because
[00:20:13.540 --> 00:20:17.820]   each section obviously has, he has his own judgment against them. If you remember the
[00:20:17.820 --> 00:20:29.820]   Babylon when remember when Babylon falls, what was the response of the people? Mocking
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:49.580]   them by celebration because the tyrant is gone. Right? Judgment on Assyria. Remember
[00:20:49.580 --> 00:20:54.660]   we told you about how Isaiah is not written chronologically. This is a perfect example
[00:20:54.660 --> 00:21:01.840]   of that. Does Babylon come after Assyria or does Assyria come after Babylon? Assyria comes
[00:21:01.840 --> 00:21:06.780]   before Babylon. Right? But in the prophecy Babylon and then he jumps back to Assyria.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:12.340]   So it's not just any chronological order. It's thematic. Philistia, there's a short
[00:21:12.340 --> 00:21:18.860]   blurb on them. So he's just kind of going down nation by nation by nation. He's like
[00:21:18.860 --> 00:21:23.740]   thorough. Right? Just as God is thorough with his love and grace, he's thorough with his
[00:21:23.740 --> 00:21:28.820]   judgment. Remember in the New Testament he says every every careless word, you know,
[00:21:28.820 --> 00:21:34.020]   you're going to be accountable for. So he says he counts every hair but he also says
[00:21:34.020 --> 00:21:38.640]   every careless word is going to be judged. So God's judgment is just as thorough as his
[00:21:38.640 --> 00:21:52.700]   love and grace. Judgment of Moab. What was unique about Moab? Why why did they mourn?
[00:21:52.700 --> 00:22:04.460]   Who? Lot. Right? So they're cousins. So if you look at the history between between Israel
[00:22:04.460 --> 00:22:08.820]   and Moabites, there are periods when they're allies and there are periods when they're
[00:22:08.820 --> 00:22:16.860]   fighting against each other but they're like cousins. Right? Just like Ephraim. Okay. Damascus.
[00:22:16.860 --> 00:22:26.940]   Cush. Remember this is one of the last places that we talked about Cush. Remember what they
[00:22:26.940 --> 00:22:36.100]   say about Cush? Cush was what what nation? Ethiopian. Ethiopia is not nearby but they
[00:22:36.100 --> 00:22:41.580]   were also a not a superpower like the Assyrians but they were a powerful nation. So they're
[00:22:41.580 --> 00:22:47.580]   coming over to Jerusalem try to ally with them maybe take tribute but God is telling
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:50.580]   them the warning them is like these people from far off are not going to help you. They're
[00:22:50.580 --> 00:23:06.820]   going to be judged like everybody else. And then judgment of Egypt. Then we didn't I had
[00:23:06.820 --> 00:23:13.100]   it read but yours I didn't I forgot to take out. Okay. Remember how I talked about at
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:20.100]   the very end he talks about judgment but because of his judgment what happens? Right? At the
[00:23:20.100 --> 00:23:25.180]   end they repent and the remnant of them come back and they said that Egypt, Assyria, and
[00:23:25.180 --> 00:23:29.500]   Israel are going to be all united as one and they're going to be a blessing to all the
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:35.060]   other people. Right? So basically if you if you talk about Egypt, Assyria, and Israel
[00:23:35.060 --> 00:23:39.300]   they're talking about that piece of land. So if you take it literally it means that
[00:23:39.300 --> 00:23:44.620]   God is going God's going to establish his kingdom in that piece of land and that area
[00:23:44.620 --> 00:23:50.300]   the that represents these nations are going to be a blessing to all the world. Right?
[00:23:50.300 --> 00:23:54.140]   So the millennial kingdom if you believe in a physical millennial kingdom is going to
[00:23:54.140 --> 00:24:00.660]   be in that piece of land. Which is interesting because so much so much of what's happening
[00:24:00.660 --> 00:24:05.940]   in modern day history happens centers around that particular area. Right? And it's always
[00:24:05.940 --> 00:24:11.340]   been busy all the way from the Old Testament to the Roman Empire to you know the battle
[00:24:11.340 --> 00:24:16.500]   between the Muslims and the Christians and establishing the Eastern and the Western Church.
[00:24:16.500 --> 00:24:21.860]   I mean Genghis Khan the Mongolians coming and conquering and back and forth. I mean
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:28.540]   that piece of land is rich in history. Right? So one day all of that is going to disappear.
[00:24:28.540 --> 00:24:32.460]   All the violence all the hatred is going to disappear. It's going to be known as a land
[00:24:32.460 --> 00:24:39.460]   of peace. The language is going to be united and the people are going to be united. Right?
[00:24:39.460 --> 00:24:48.100]   Again, chapter 20 ends with reminder of judgment. So we didn't get to chapter 21, 22, 23 but
[00:24:48.100 --> 00:24:53.000]   basically it goes over other nations kind of like he does here. Okay? So there's a possibility
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:25:00.260]   that next time we pick up I may just begin in chapter 24. Okay? Because the theme switches
[00:25:00.260 --> 00:25:06.180]   around chapter 24. Okay? So if you're one of those eager students that want to be thorough
[00:25:06.180 --> 00:25:12.620]   and you know get things so you got two week break so you got chapter 21, 22 and 23 to
[00:25:12.620 --> 00:25:17.980]   go over. Okay? All right. So what I want you to do is I want you to give I'm going to give
[00:25:17.980 --> 00:25:23.320]   you about five, ten minutes with your group just kind of go over that material. Okay?
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:28.900]   With each other. I don't know. Discuss it. Read it by yourself. And then about ten minutes
[00:25:28.900 --> 00:25:37.420]   I'm going to start asking questions. I got about 25 questions. I'm going to put up a
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:43.300]   verse. Yeah. I would say about two thirds of it is like that and the other one third
[00:25:43.300 --> 00:26:02.300]   is going to be it's just going to be questions. Yeah. All right. Okay. I'm just going to you
[00:26:02.300 --> 00:26:08.580]   know I'm just going to judge from what I see. It's kind of like roughing the BBA. I'm not
[00:26:08.580 --> 00:26:17.940]   going to see everything. Okay. So whatever whatever seems right in my eyes. Right. That's
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:28.060]   what I'm going to choose. Okay. Yeah. Because it's going to be it's going to be time. Yeah.
[00:26:28.060 --> 00:26:30.980]   We're not I'm not going to give you a minute. So if you end up if you have to search your
[00:26:30.980 --> 00:26:36.900]   Bible you're probably not going to have enough time. Huh? You're not going to have time.
[00:26:36.900 --> 00:26:41.340]   So if you raise your hand and I go to you because all I'm asking you is chapter two
[00:26:41.340 --> 00:26:48.700]   chapter three. It feels like oh wait a second. Chapter. Big. Okay. So you're going to have
[00:26:48.700 --> 00:26:53.100]   to if you raise your hand you need to know the chapter. I need to I need to hear it.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:58.820]   Okay. I'll give you one two three four five. If you don't say it in in those five seconds
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:03.860]   then we're going to move on. Okay. So don't raise your hand if you don't know. Don't raise
[00:27:03.860 --> 00:27:09.260]   your hand and then figure it out. Two seconds. Okay. Two seconds. I was trying to be gracious.
[00:27:09.260 --> 00:27:18.780]   All right. Here you go. Oh okay. Okay. Let's do this. The team choose one person to raise
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:29.380]   your hand. Okay. One person in that team to raise your hand. Okay. Was that going to work?
[00:27:29.380 --> 00:27:55.140]   Was that not going to work? Huh? I can't hear a word you're saying. Huh? We should have
[00:27:55.140 --> 00:28:17.780]   negative huh? So you don't just. Okay. I should have thought this through a little bit. All
[00:28:17.780 --> 00:28:23.100]   right. Minus points. Minus points. So you only raise it if you actually know. That you
[00:28:23.100 --> 00:28:35.980]   don't go and say eight. It's better than lottery odds right? Okay. Here you go. All right.
[00:28:35.980 --> 00:28:41.100]   Let's do this. Yeah. Only one person from your. So if somebody in that table knows it
[00:28:41.100 --> 00:28:45.020]   tell that one person raise your hand raise your hand. And then you have one two three
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:29:06.460]   seconds to answer. Okay. And don't do it if you don't know. Okay. Here you go. Here you
[00:29:06.460 --> 00:29:13.900]   go. No. The verse is going to come up. Verse is going to come up and then. Yeah. And then
[00:29:13.900 --> 00:29:25.180]   you're going to tell me what chapter that's in. Okay. Here you go. No practice no practice.
[00:29:25.180 --> 00:29:33.020]   Ready? Hey raise your hand if you're the person that's designated can you raise your hand?
[00:29:33.020 --> 00:29:43.580]   Okay. That team forfeit? Okay. Yes yes yes yes. Okay yes. Yes. Okay all right. Raise
[00:29:43.580 --> 00:30:11.660]   your hand high. I can't see. Ready? Here you go. All right. Ready? Ready? Richard first.
[00:30:11.660 --> 00:30:37.740]   Okay. All right. Yeah. One thirteen. Okay. Okay. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah.
[00:30:37.740 --> 00:31:02.460]   Yeah. You figure it out. I'm keeping track. Yeah. One one point. Why? Because a better
[00:31:02.460 --> 00:31:15.020]   view? You don't you just don't trust Richard. Should have worn a t-shirt. Hand raised. Ready?
[00:31:15.020 --> 00:31:33.740]   I might be blank again. Oh. After seven fourteen.
[00:31:33.740 --> 00:32:00.060]   Easy ones in the front. Okay. I'm going to stand over here just to be fair. Okay.
[00:32:00.060 --> 00:32:15.900]   Gloria. Huh? Chapter nine? Chapter six.
[00:32:15.900 --> 00:32:44.780]   Okay. Ready? One two three. Minus minus. Hold on hold on hold on hold on. It's too late
[00:32:44.780 --> 00:32:59.980]   now. All right. I cannot tell who did it second. Chapter two. Okay. You only get one chance.
[00:32:59.980 --> 00:33:20.060]   There's no way I'm going to be able to know. Okay. All right. Ready? Okay. Gloria. One
[00:33:20.060 --> 00:33:47.420]   two three. I can't I can't tell who did it. Whoever shoes whoever yells the loudest.
[00:33:47.420 --> 00:34:17.340]   Okay. Jen I Jen I. Jen I Jen I. Huh? One two five. Okay. Ready? One two. Richard. One two
[00:34:17.340 --> 00:34:36.380]   three. Hold on hold on. I know I know who was second on this one. This table. Four.
[00:34:36.380 --> 00:35:05.420]   Minus one. Hey. But you were the fastest though. You're the fastest. Ready? Sean. Sean. Huh?
[00:35:05.420 --> 00:35:34.940]   Eleven. No no no. I called Sean. All right. Ready? I forgot where this ends. Ready? Okay.
[00:35:34.940 --> 00:35:41.260]   So as we're doing this, I want you guys to see how it fits into the three major themes.
[00:35:41.260 --> 00:35:49.220]   I forgot to tell you that. That's the point of this game. So at least you know how those
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:58.780]   verses fit into the big theme. Okay. That was a waste of eight questions. All right.
[00:35:58.780 --> 00:36:26.700]   So. Oh nothing. Oh ho. Okay. Ready? So far. Uh. I'm not sure what I'm doing. I'm not sure.
[00:36:26.700 --> 00:36:37.500]   So far. Dale's group. I've never I haven't seen the hand raised yet. It went up. I just
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:43.700]   didn't see it. All right. Mark's group has one point. Philip's group had one. Lost one.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:56.820]   Grace. Did I give it to wrong? How come I X'd it? So you don't have a minus. You just
[00:36:56.820 --> 00:37:06.820]   have one. Oh wow. For being greedy, we're going to take that away. James's group zero.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:13.940]   David Rims one. Ashley's minus one. Joe's group minus one. Cheryl's group. Who did it?
[00:37:13.940 --> 00:37:23.460]   Oh no. Zisk does Joe. Okay. It's only one point. Calm down. Cheryl one point. Joe Wu's
[00:37:23.460 --> 00:37:45.620]   group zero. Jen. Huh? What happened? Oh that's who you were. Gloria's group had plus one
[00:37:45.620 --> 00:37:50.900]   minus one. So you have zero. Right? Okay. Thank you. Jenna's group has one. Becky's
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:38:07.140]   group nothing yet. Mike's nothing. And then Gloria zero. Okay. All right. Ready? Mike.
[00:38:07.140 --> 00:38:22.740]   Huh? Thirteenth. You're tied. You're tied with the two other groups. All right. So you
[00:38:22.740 --> 00:38:49.620]   don't feel so bad. All right. Ready? Mike. Thirteenth. Now you're not tied. Okay. Okay.
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:39:14.100]   Ready? One. All right. Put your hand down. All right. Everybody put your hand down. Put
[00:39:14.100 --> 00:39:29.860]   your hand down. Put it up. Okay. What chapter? What chapter? Oh sorry, sorry, sorry. Yeah,
[00:39:29.860 --> 00:39:41.780]   yeah, yeah. You're right. You're right. Okay. Okay. Go ahead. Go ahead. Yeah. I forgot to
[00:39:41.780 --> 00:39:47.540]   tell you from this point on you can't look at your paper. Okay. So put it down. Yeah.
[00:39:47.540 --> 00:39:52.580]   That was my bad. That was my bad. Yeah. Two points. And then if we're talking back, minus
[00:39:52.580 --> 00:40:04.340]   two points. All right. Who wants to do it without looking? All three. Go ahead. One
[00:40:04.340 --> 00:40:12.660]   through six is just rebellion against God and God's plan for restoration. Seven through
[00:40:12.660 --> 00:40:22.260]   twelve is God's promise of deliverance. And then thirteen through twenty-eight is God's
[00:40:22.260 --> 00:40:33.300]   judgment. God's judgment on the nation. Okay. I was close enough. Yeah. To twenty-three.
[00:40:33.300 --> 00:40:37.940]   Okay. But we only started to twenty so. Okay. I'll give you one point. One point for that.
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:47.460]   Okay. All right. All right. From this point on you can't look at your paper. Okay. Don't
[00:40:47.460 --> 00:40:59.140]   cheat. It's not worth it. Okay. And it'll be two points from now on. Okay. Yeah but
[00:40:59.140 --> 00:41:04.100]   you're not going to have enough time. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Okay. Yeah but you're not going
[00:41:04.100 --> 00:41:15.700]   to have enough time. Okay. Huh? No because I didn't say. Yeah. So eager. UCLA. All right.

[00:41:56.020 --> 00:42:11.140]   looking. Okay. Oh. It's in the very beginning. You missed one. Okay. No no no. Don't look
[00:42:11.140 --> 00:42:17.620]   at that. Yeah yeah yeah. No no no. Don't look at your Bible. From this point. This time
[00:42:17.620 --> 00:42:24.500]   you can't look at anything. Okay. That's two points. Right? So you have minus one point
[00:42:24.500 --> 00:42:33.300]   now. Oh. A little pause for a second. I have no idea when this ends. So we're going to
[00:42:33.300 --> 00:42:58.260]   keep going. All right. Ready? That group. Remember we talked about that? He mentions
[00:42:58.260 --> 00:43:07.220]   over and over again in the midst of every. Huh? Half credit. All right. Wow okay. Look
[00:43:07.220 --> 00:43:36.180]   at that. Minus one to plus three. All right. Okay. Ready? Johnny. What was that? LX. LX.

[00:45:23.220 --> 00:45:49.540]   right there. Okay. Minus two. Remove protection.
[00:45:49.540 --> 00:45:58.260]   Remember what God says in chapter five that he's going to take the hedge away and then
[00:45:58.260 --> 00:46:08.660]   all all this stuff God was protecting them is going to happen to them. Right? Okay. Okay
[00:46:08.660 --> 00:46:25.780]   ready? Put your hand up. Put your hand up. Put your hand up. Okay. I turned my head for
[00:46:25.780 --> 00:46:44.980]   one second. Okay we'll give this this group a chance. Dale's group is on the board. All
[00:46:44.980 --> 00:47:14.660]   right ready? Okay. Syria, Babylon, Egypt and Syria? No. Syria, Babylon, Egypt.
[00:47:14.660 --> 00:47:29.860]   No. He said the official was not a Syrian. He did. It's the Babylonians, Syria, Egypt
[00:47:29.860 --> 00:47:51.060]   and Syria. Okay. What did you say? Persia. Persia. Persia. Okay. I was kind of at your
[00:47:51.060 --> 00:48:19.740]   question. I don't think I have any more. Wait. I thought I was done. Hold on. David. Yes.
[00:48:19.740 --> 00:48:35.620]   Can you elaborate? Peace is. What would his rule be? His rule. Okay. Justice, righteousness.
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:41.820]   Fair and just. Right? Well the first part of that is actually peace. All right. First
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:52.580]   part of that and then it says it will be fair and just. Okay. All right. So far Dale's group
[00:48:52.580 --> 00:49:04.840]   is leading. Ashley's group has three and then Philip and James has two. Yeah. And then Mike
[00:49:04.840 --> 00:49:16.300]   has zero. And other people have some points. Yeah. One point, one point. Okay. I might
[00:49:16.300 --> 00:49:45.540]   be at the end. Gloria. Huh? Millennial Kingdom. Okay. Millennial Kingdom. Okay. Ready? China.
[00:49:45.540 --> 00:50:01.940]   What did you say? All right. If you get this, if you get, I think there's four or five.
[00:50:01.940 --> 00:50:12.060]   If you get even at least three, then it give you three points. Okay. Three. Okay. First
[00:50:12.060 --> 00:50:19.060]   point. They would have their land back. Two, that they would be a blessing to the surrounding
[00:50:19.060 --> 00:50:31.260]   nations. And three, that they would have God's favor. No. Yeah. No, because I'm asking specifically
[00:50:31.260 --> 00:50:36.660]   in chapter 14. Okay. I think you're trying to, you know, think about the theology. I'm
[00:50:36.660 --> 00:50:42.900]   talking specifically chapter 14. They will take the land back. They will rule over those
[00:50:42.900 --> 00:50:50.900]   who ruled over them and they will take them as slaves. Yeah, they will take them as slaves.
[00:50:50.900 --> 00:50:56.500]   A woman and men as slaves. Yes. Okay. Those, I will count those three. Okay. Israel will
[00:50:56.500 --> 00:51:03.780]   be restored, brought back into their land. Non-Jews will also come join with Israel.
[00:51:03.780 --> 00:51:10.260]   Israel will rule over the other nations and they will take them captive. Okay. So three.
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:22.380]   Oh, I don't know if that was it. Oh, that was it. Okay. Here you go. Yeah. All right.
[00:51:22.380 --> 00:51:32.060]   All right. Zales group came so close. You guys were leading until the very end, but
[00:51:32.060 --> 00:51:41.420]   you would have still lost. This group has five. Gloria's group or that group, Cheryl's
[00:51:41.420 --> 00:51:49.260]   group had three and then the others have one or two. Okay. All right. So Philip's group
[00:51:49.260 --> 00:51:55.060]   won. So we'll give you a gift card and it's only to be used with the whole group together.
[00:51:55.060 --> 00:51:55.820]   Small group.
