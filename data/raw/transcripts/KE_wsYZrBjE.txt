[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.840]   Yesterday, we talked about modesty and bikinis, no small topic.
[00:00:09.840 --> 00:00:13.120]   And today we talk about summer vacations in general.
[00:00:13.120 --> 00:00:16.800]   The summer vacation season has begun in the United States and a listener named
[00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.600]   Ryan writes in to ask this, Pastor John.
[00:00:18.600 --> 00:00:22.040]   I'm wondering if you could discuss the theology of vacations.
[00:00:22.040 --> 00:00:26.160]   You often talk about not wasting your life or any moment or season in it.
[00:00:26.840 --> 00:00:30.880]   Intellectually, I agree, but at times it just seems like I need to rest.
[00:00:30.880 --> 00:00:32.480]   Where do vacations fit?
[00:00:32.480 --> 00:00:39.920]   Well, you do need a rest and the Bible provides some pretty significant
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:46.160]   foundations for rest and I think indirectly for vacations.
[00:00:46.160 --> 00:00:49.120]   And so let me just mention a few of those foundations that I
[00:00:49.120 --> 00:00:51.040]   think give us some guidance.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:57.480]   Number one, God created us in need of daily sleep.
[00:00:57.480 --> 00:01:00.280]   I have always found that quite frustrating.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:02.560]   I hate sleep.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:04.640]   I find sleep boring.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:16.400]   So why did he make me like a helpless baby that must go unconscious one third of my life?
[00:01:16.400 --> 00:01:18.160]   I mean, just think of it.
[00:01:18.360 --> 00:01:21.000]   What is the message in that?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:23.160]   There's got to be a message in that.
[00:01:23.160 --> 00:01:30.440]   And Psalm 127 says, "It is in vain that you rise up early and go late to rest,
[00:01:30.440 --> 00:01:35.960]   eating the bread of anxious toil, for he gives to his beloved," some
[00:01:35.960 --> 00:01:39.600]   translations say, "in his sleep some sleep."
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:42.600]   I think the gist in the context is pretty much the same.
[00:01:43.360 --> 00:01:49.200]   According to this text, sleep is a gift from God and the gift is often
[00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:51.960]   spurned by anxious toil.
[00:01:51.960 --> 00:01:55.960]   Peaceful sleep is the opposite of anxiety.
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.600]   God does not want his children to be anxious, but to trust him.
[00:01:59.600 --> 00:02:08.680]   So I conclude that God made sleep as a continual reminder that we should not be
[00:02:08.680 --> 00:02:13.200]   anxious, but should rest in him like a little baby.
[00:02:13.200 --> 00:02:16.720]   Unless you turn to become like a child, you can't even enter the kingdom.
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:24.480]   He created sleep to make sure we would have a daily reminder we are not God.
[00:02:24.480 --> 00:02:29.760]   Our work is not decisive in running the world.
[00:02:29.760 --> 00:02:32.880]   God's work is decisive.
[00:02:33.200 --> 00:02:40.400]   "He who keeps Israel will neither slumber nor sleep," Psalm 121.
[00:02:40.400 --> 00:02:42.320]   So we sleep.
[00:02:42.320 --> 00:02:44.000]   God never sleeps.
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:46.120]   So sleep is foundational.
[00:02:46.120 --> 00:02:47.080]   It's a pointer.
[00:02:47.080 --> 00:02:54.320]   And I think the big picture there we take away is don't get a big head about your
[00:02:54.320 --> 00:02:58.720]   work that you think you can run the world or make everything happen.
[00:02:58.720 --> 00:03:01.800]   You're like a little baby, a third of your life, and God meant to tell you
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:07.120]   something. Number two, God established a Sabbath principle.
[00:03:07.120 --> 00:03:13.200]   However you relate the Old Testament law to the present, the Sabbath remains a
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:14.840]   gift with wisdom in it.
[00:03:14.840 --> 00:03:18.280]   I remember reading C.S.
[00:03:18.280 --> 00:03:25.000]   Lewis's wife's book on the Ten Commandments and seeing her point out the
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:31.920]   wonder and the glory and the incredible gift of telling an ancient agricultural
[00:03:31.920 --> 00:03:38.280]   people whose lives depended on working the land, "Not only don't you have to go
[00:03:38.280 --> 00:03:41.320]   to work today, you may not go to work today.
[00:03:41.320 --> 00:03:43.600]   Mandatory weekly vacation."
[00:03:43.600 --> 00:03:44.840]   And it was stunning.
[00:03:44.840 --> 00:03:47.240]   I mean, I just had never seen it in that light.
[00:03:47.240 --> 00:03:52.800]   And she said, "That is exactly the way it would have landed on people, at least at
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.560]   the beginning.
[00:03:53.560 --> 00:03:56.720]   You may not work seven days a week.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:03:58.480]   I won't let you.
[00:03:58.480 --> 00:04:00.000]   You must."
[00:04:00.000 --> 00:04:07.640]   And then he consecrated it to himself as a sign of his own creative power and
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:19.440]   holiness, but the underlying issue of its gift nature to a worn-out, finite, tired
[00:04:19.440 --> 00:04:21.840]   agricultural people remains.
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:27.160]   And so I say the rhythm of work six, rest one, work six, rest one, work six, rest
[00:04:27.160 --> 00:04:35.640]   one would probably spare a lot of heart attacks and give longevity to many lives
[00:04:35.640 --> 00:04:40.480]   prematurely taken because they never unwind the spring.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:41.680]   They're always working.
[00:04:41.680 --> 00:04:45.440]   They're working at home, and they're working at work, and they're working in
[00:04:45.440 --> 00:04:48.280]   their play, and they can't stop working.
[00:04:48.280 --> 00:04:51.360]   And I don't think that's what one in seven means.
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.960]   This spring that we live by, especially for some of us, it needs to be unwound,
[00:04:56.960 --> 00:05:02.040]   not just two weeks a year, but one day a week.
[00:05:02.040 --> 00:05:08.080]   Here's number three, third foundational idea to point towards rest and vacation.
[00:05:08.080 --> 00:05:13.880]   Work is good, and it's not a curse, but it is redeemed.
[00:05:13.880 --> 00:05:18.440]   So we must work the works of Him while it is day.
[00:05:18.440 --> 00:05:22.440]   Jesus called for work, and we ought to work.
[00:05:22.440 --> 00:05:26.240]   And Paul said, "If anyone's not willing to work, let him not eat."
[00:05:26.240 --> 00:05:31.800]   And I love this verse in 1 Corinthians 15, "Be steadfast, immovable, always abounding
[00:05:31.800 --> 00:05:36.160]   in the work of the Lord, knowing that in the Lord your labor is not in vain."
[00:05:36.160 --> 00:05:40.200]   That means be doing a lot of it, abounding in the work of the Lord.
[00:05:40.200 --> 00:05:43.240]   And Paul said, "Don't be weary in doing good."
[00:05:43.240 --> 00:05:46.120]   So here's the rub.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:48.080]   How do you not grow weary?
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.680]   I mean, he says, "Don't grow weary in doing good."
[00:05:52.680 --> 00:05:57.520]   But we get physically depleted, we get mentally depleted, which raises then the question of
[00:05:57.520 --> 00:05:58.520]   vacations.
[00:05:58.520 --> 00:06:01.760]   And here's the last thing I would say.
[00:06:01.760 --> 00:06:03.800]   Here's the fourth foundational thing.
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:08.520]   God's Son took special times to rest from labor.
[00:06:08.520 --> 00:06:15.560]   Mark 6:31, "He said to them, 'Come away by yourselves to a desolate place and rest a
[00:06:15.560 --> 00:06:16.560]   while.'"
[00:06:16.560 --> 00:06:22.880]   It's interesting that he said that right after these brothers buried the chopped off
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:29.640]   head of John the Baptist, which meant probably not only did you risk your lives to go get
[00:06:29.640 --> 00:06:34.320]   that head or the body at least, I don't know which they buried.
[00:06:34.320 --> 00:06:35.760]   They got his body, they buried it.
[00:06:35.760 --> 00:06:36.760]   You risked your lives.
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:40.080]   This has been a high stress time for you.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:43.680]   So come away and rest a while.
[00:06:43.680 --> 00:06:53.000]   So my summary would be, it seems that the issue of vacations becomes a matter of wisdom.
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.360]   We should try to know ourselves, know our families.
[00:06:56.360 --> 00:07:04.720]   Seems to me that in this fallen age where the focus is on redemption, the final rest
[00:07:04.720 --> 00:07:13.600]   that we are promised is only tasted incrementally and as a means of more productive labor in
[00:07:13.600 --> 00:07:15.520]   this redemptive age.
[00:07:15.520 --> 00:07:22.040]   Play and recreation in this age is not the main way we glorify God.
[00:07:22.040 --> 00:07:28.480]   It's secondary, I think, and it's a means of refreshing us and inspiring us for productive
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:30.200]   labor.
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:36.720]   We work to advance God's saving kingdom in a fallen world, and that's true whether we're
[00:07:36.720 --> 00:07:41.520]   in secular work or so-called Christian work.
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:48.800]   Vacations and Sabbaths and days off and nights of sleep are recreations of creative, happy,
[00:07:48.800 --> 00:07:54.160]   fruitful labor for the advancement of Christ's kingdom in the world, whether you're in a
[00:07:54.160 --> 00:07:56.800]   secular work or not.
[00:07:56.800 --> 00:08:05.420]   And of course, there is no clear line, I feel this especially, for many of us between vocation
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:07.700]   and recreation.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:15.680]   Many of us so love what we do and find so much pleasure in it and are so energized by
[00:08:15.680 --> 00:08:24.200]   it that the concept of taking time for recreation for the sake of creation is not so clear.
[00:08:24.200 --> 00:08:31.440]   For those folks, we need to make sure that we know not only ourselves, but we need to
[00:08:31.440 --> 00:08:37.160]   know those around us, because our wives may not feel the same, and our kids may need us
[00:08:37.160 --> 00:08:42.600]   when we're just super energized by our reading or our study, and that's not what they need
[00:08:42.600 --> 00:08:47.400]   at this time, and vacations account for that as well as for us.
[00:08:47.400 --> 00:08:49.080]   Thank you, Pastor John.
[00:08:49.080 --> 00:08:54.480]   That is a good word on vacations and rest, and we will return tomorrow—actually, I'll
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.040]   return tomorrow with a weekend conversation.
[00:08:56.040 --> 00:09:00.200]   We're going to be talking with someone who has been studying Bible design for several
[00:09:00.200 --> 00:09:04.120]   decades, and we're going to talk about a little history of Bible clutter.
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:08.680]   How did our Bibles become such technical books with so many notes and symbols in it?
[00:09:08.680 --> 00:09:13.520]   It's an interesting story, and it has led to a Bible format that has particular ramifications
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:15.920]   on how we read and engage the text itself.
[00:09:15.920 --> 00:09:18.840]   We're going to look at Bible clutter tomorrow.
