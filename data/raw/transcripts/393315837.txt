[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:11.400]   All right, if you could turn your Bibles with me to Matthew 22 verses 36 through 40.
[00:00:11.400 --> 00:00:14.440]   I think initially when I started this I said I'm going to give me a couple weeks and we're
[00:00:14.440 --> 00:00:18.400]   going to jump into Hebrews chapter 7.
[00:00:18.400 --> 00:00:19.400]   I don't think so, not yet.
[00:00:19.400 --> 00:00:20.400]   Okay?
[00:00:20.400 --> 00:00:22.880]   So you're going to have to give me a couple more weeks.
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:26.400]   So actually I started this sermon this morning thinking that I'll be done with this and I
[00:00:26.400 --> 00:00:30.800]   have one more sermon next week but I didn't get through the sermon first service.
[00:00:30.800 --> 00:00:31.800]   Okay?
[00:00:31.800 --> 00:00:37.600]   So I'm going to try to wrap it up next week so we can jump into Hebrews the following
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:41.720]   week after that but no guarantee.
[00:00:41.720 --> 00:00:42.720]   All right?
[00:00:42.720 --> 00:00:43.720]   We'll see what happens.
[00:00:43.720 --> 00:00:44.720]   Okay?
[00:00:44.720 --> 00:00:47.280]   But again, I believe that this is so important.
[00:00:47.280 --> 00:00:48.880]   I don't want to rush through any of this.
[00:00:48.880 --> 00:00:51.320]   Matthew 22, 36 to 40.
[00:00:51.320 --> 00:00:53.640]   "Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law?"
[00:00:53.640 --> 00:00:57.440]   And he said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all your
[00:00:57.440 --> 00:00:59.360]   soul and with all your mind."
[00:00:59.360 --> 00:01:00.680]   This is a great and foremost commandment.
[00:01:00.680 --> 00:01:01.760]   The second is like it.
[00:01:01.760 --> 00:01:05.280]   "You shall love your neighbor as yourself and on these two commandments depend the whole
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.760]   law and the prophets."
[00:01:06.760 --> 00:01:08.760]   Let's pray.
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:16.440]   Heavenly Father, what an awesome and gracious and loving God you are.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:23.920]   Help us, Lord God, to have a soft heart that is you are the powder and we are the clay.
[00:01:23.920 --> 00:01:29.620]   We desire to be molded, Lord God, into your image and what you desire us to be.
[00:01:29.620 --> 00:01:37.160]   I pray that the power of the cross would convict us, remind us, refresh us, renew us that we
[00:01:37.160 --> 00:01:41.040]   truly may be new creatures, Lord God.
[00:01:41.040 --> 00:01:44.080]   That we may be people who worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:49.960]   May your word goes forth and will not return until it has accomplished the purpose that
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:50.960]   you have ordained it.
[00:01:50.960 --> 00:01:54.500]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:54.500 --> 00:02:02.840]   Have you ever said in any point of your Christian life, "I love Christ, but I don't love the
[00:02:02.840 --> 00:02:05.720]   church."
[00:02:05.720 --> 00:02:10.440]   Or have you ever tried to invite somebody to church and they said to you, "I love the
[00:02:10.440 --> 00:02:11.440]   gospel.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:15.200]   The messages that you're sharing with me, it's an awesome message about the love of
[00:02:15.200 --> 00:02:19.920]   Christ, but I don't believe the church."
[00:02:19.920 --> 00:02:22.640]   Maybe you've thought that at some point and maybe you're trying to share the gospel.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.740]   Maybe there's somebody in your life right now who's professing to be a believer of Jesus
[00:02:26.740 --> 00:02:35.160]   Christ, but he says, "I love Christ, but I can't stand the church."
[00:02:35.160 --> 00:02:39.640]   So now, especially with all the technology, there's more options to stay at home and just
[00:02:39.640 --> 00:02:43.840]   kind of video stream live services.
[00:02:43.840 --> 00:02:47.960]   And he said, "I want the message, I want the love of Christ, I want the scriptures, but
[00:02:47.960 --> 00:02:49.480]   I don't want to be around people."
[00:02:49.480 --> 00:02:55.600]   You know, the message that we've been talking about, the two greatest commandments, to love
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:03:00.160]   the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength, and love others as yourself,
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:05.600]   are the two central commandments according to Jesus that wraps up every other commandment.
[00:03:05.600 --> 00:03:11.600]   So what he's saying here is not one of many important things that we need to get right.
[00:03:11.600 --> 00:03:17.040]   It is the central thing, and if you don't get this, then he says, "You missed the whole
[00:03:17.040 --> 00:03:20.280]   point of Christianity."
[00:03:20.280 --> 00:03:26.280]   You know, whenever we talk about agape love, it is easy to talk about.
[00:03:26.280 --> 00:03:33.480]   I don't know if ever in my years of preaching that I've ever had a hard time preaching about
[00:03:33.480 --> 00:03:34.480]   agape love.
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:41.160]   Agape love, I can preach this until I retire every single Sunday, because the whole Bible,
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:47.600]   from Genesis to Revelation, is filled with teachings and examples, after examples, after
[00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.960]   examples about agape love.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:57.000]   And whenever agape love is preached, people are encouraged, people are enlightened.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:03:59.640]   And it's like, thank you for preaching that.
[00:03:59.640 --> 00:04:04.960]   And it's not difficult to preach about agape love, because who wouldn't?
[00:04:04.960 --> 00:04:11.280]   The Son of God who died for us, who are undeserving while we were yet blaspheming, while we were
[00:04:11.280 --> 00:04:12.920]   yet sinners, he loves us.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:18.240]   And even after we convert, even after we swear, as long as we repent, he accepts us.
[00:04:18.240 --> 00:04:20.940]   He made us adopted children.
[00:04:20.940 --> 00:04:23.840]   Who wouldn't want to hear that message?
[00:04:23.840 --> 00:04:32.640]   It is easy to preach, but it is the most difficult thing to practice.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.840]   It's something that we admire from a distance.
[00:04:35.840 --> 00:04:39.960]   We want to talk about, we want to memorize scripture about the agape love.
[00:04:39.960 --> 00:04:47.960]   But as soon as we get to the therefore, therefore, considering all that he has done, therefore,
[00:04:47.960 --> 00:04:51.800]   live up to the calling of that gospel.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:56.760]   And even that sounds beautiful, great to memorize.
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:06.500]   But as soon as we begin to practice this, we realize how impossible it is to do.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:12.040]   You have memories of specific people in your life who have hurt you deeply.
[00:05:12.040 --> 00:05:19.560]   Some of you have some horrendous experiences in church.
[00:05:19.560 --> 00:05:24.120]   Maybe even by your small believers, maybe even by your pastors.
[00:05:24.120 --> 00:05:28.920]   Some of you have been slandered deliberately, maybe have been targeted and somebody betrayed
[00:05:28.920 --> 00:05:29.920]   you.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.680]   And you have, if you've been a Christian or if you've been a human being for any length
[00:05:32.680 --> 00:05:39.280]   of time, maybe even have been physically assaulted.
[00:05:39.280 --> 00:05:46.600]   So when we talk about God loving us unconditionally, it's a beautiful story that we're all attracted
[00:05:46.600 --> 00:05:56.520]   to, but as soon as we get to therefore, therefore, you practice the same.
[00:05:56.520 --> 00:05:59.720]   How do you do that?
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:00.720]   How do you do that?
[00:06:00.720 --> 00:06:03.760]   How do you practice this agape love?
[00:06:03.760 --> 00:06:07.520]   There's four things that he mentions here that I want to highlight.
[00:06:07.520 --> 00:06:11.800]   And again, I don't want to skim through it because there's so much to unpack here.
[00:06:11.800 --> 00:06:16.540]   He says that the second commandment is like it.
[00:06:16.540 --> 00:06:18.980]   So that's the first part that we're going to unpack.
[00:06:18.980 --> 00:06:22.320]   What does that mean that the second commandment is like it?
[00:06:22.320 --> 00:06:28.720]   And then, probably next week, he said the target of these people, of this agape love,
[00:06:28.720 --> 00:06:29.720]   is our neighbors.
[00:06:29.720 --> 00:06:32.560]   And we'll unpack that again next week.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.760]   And then he says to the degree that we are to love them is to love like we are to love
[00:06:36.760 --> 00:06:39.720]   ourselves.
[00:06:39.720 --> 00:06:45.620]   And then he says, finally, all of this fulfills the law.
[00:06:45.620 --> 00:06:51.540]   All of the law, whole of the law is summarized in these two commandments.
[00:06:51.540 --> 00:06:54.780]   So this morning, I want to first, and then we'll see how far we get, but the first one
[00:06:54.780 --> 00:06:58.500]   that we want to look at, and he says, after we're talking about the high view of loving
[00:06:58.500 --> 00:07:02.940]   God with all our hearts, all mind, and strength, and he says the second to love others is like
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.280]   it.
[00:07:04.280 --> 00:07:07.180]   What does that mean that it is like it?
[00:07:07.180 --> 00:07:11.520]   Now you don't get this in the English, but in the Greek, it's really important that we
[00:07:11.520 --> 00:07:14.180]   understand the word that he's using here.
[00:07:14.180 --> 00:07:21.220]   Because this word, misapplied, at one point in church history, could have completely divided
[00:07:21.220 --> 00:07:23.020]   the church.
[00:07:23.020 --> 00:07:28.780]   One of the first theological debates that the church debated over, I mean, almost to
[00:07:28.780 --> 00:07:33.980]   death, and I'm not exaggerating, there was a guy named Arius who came out and he said
[00:07:33.980 --> 00:07:37.220]   that Jesus is homoousius.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.220]   Homoousius.
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:44.940]   Again, I know this means nothing to you now, but give me a second.
[00:07:44.940 --> 00:07:50.980]   And then Athanasius came out and he said, no, he's not homoousius, he is homoousius.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:56.620]   And the difference between the two words is homoousius means that he is similar to God
[00:07:56.620 --> 00:07:58.620]   in substance.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:08:03.500]   Homoousius means that he is the same in substance.
[00:08:03.500 --> 00:08:08.860]   So Arius was arguing to convince the whole church, and at one point he was very successful,
[00:08:08.860 --> 00:08:12.620]   that Jesus is not the same as God.
[00:08:12.620 --> 00:08:14.620]   That Jesus is similar in substance.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:21.660]   So Jesus is elevated to a God status, but there was a time when Jesus did not exist,
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:24.260]   so he is not the same.
[00:08:24.260 --> 00:08:29.500]   The doctrine that you and I profess to believe is that Jesus Christ is homoousius, he is
[00:08:29.500 --> 00:08:30.500]   the same.
[00:08:30.500 --> 00:08:33.660]   He is the third person of the triune God.
[00:08:33.660 --> 00:08:39.620]   So this little iota, this little I made the difference between embracing the true God
[00:08:39.620 --> 00:08:41.740]   and the false God.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:48.740]   And Athanasius at one point in church history, by himself, risking his life, he said this
[00:08:48.740 --> 00:08:50.340]   is not what the scripture teaches.
[00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:55.020]   Again, part of the reason why I believe that the canon was available commonly to many people
[00:08:55.020 --> 00:08:57.200]   at the time is because of this doctrine.
[00:08:57.200 --> 00:09:04.300]   And he was able to argue scripturally that Jesus Christ is homoousius, not homoiousius.
[00:09:04.300 --> 00:09:10.060]   Now even if all of that went over your head, it's a very, very important part of church
[00:09:10.060 --> 00:09:11.940]   history.
[00:09:11.940 --> 00:09:18.100]   But the point that I'm trying to make, that this little iota, this little I, makes a difference
[00:09:18.100 --> 00:09:23.340]   between is he saying it is the same or it is similar?
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:29.620]   And let me tell you, the word that he is using here is homoious, not homoous.
[00:09:29.620 --> 00:09:34.800]   That it is like it, that it is not the same.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:37.660]   Now why is that important?
[00:09:37.660 --> 00:09:46.500]   The application of that is that you can love people and not love God because it is not
[00:09:46.500 --> 00:09:48.940]   the same.
[00:09:48.940 --> 00:09:54.300]   You can be committed to social justice and not love God.
[00:09:54.300 --> 00:10:00.060]   You can be a good mother, good father, you can be a good person, a good neighbor, and
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:02.060]   not love God.
[00:10:02.060 --> 00:10:08.100]   You've probably met many people who are not believers in Christ who are very generous.
[00:10:08.100 --> 00:10:12.580]   They feed the homeless, they fight for certain social justices.
[00:10:12.580 --> 00:10:13.740]   And all of these things are great.
[00:10:13.740 --> 00:10:18.580]   The Bible tells us that if we say that we love God and we don't love our neighbor, it's
[00:10:18.580 --> 00:10:19.820]   fake.
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:21.380]   So it is a quality that God desires.
[00:10:21.380 --> 00:10:26.420]   But loving our neighbors doesn't equal loving God.
[00:10:26.420 --> 00:10:35.740]   But the Bible also says that you cannot love God and not love your neighbor.
[00:10:35.740 --> 00:10:39.540]   You can love your neighbor and not love God, but you cannot love God and not love your
[00:10:39.540 --> 00:10:40.800]   neighbor.
[00:10:40.800 --> 00:10:48.500]   So for somebody to say that I love Christ, the head, but I can't stand the body.
[00:10:48.500 --> 00:10:51.620]   That's no different than if a husband or wife is getting married and the husband says, "You
[00:10:51.620 --> 00:10:52.620]   know what?
[00:10:52.620 --> 00:10:56.860]   I want to marry your head, but the rest of your body, I'm not ready."
[00:10:56.860 --> 00:11:00.500]   I like this part of you, who you are, right here, the head.
[00:11:00.500 --> 00:11:02.780]   I like your lips, I like your nose.
[00:11:02.780 --> 00:11:07.880]   But from here down, I don't want to make a covenant relationship.
[00:11:07.880 --> 00:11:10.700]   So when I put a ring on you at the wedding ceremony, I'm going to put it on your nose,
[00:11:10.700 --> 00:11:12.700]   not your finger.
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:14.380]   Ridiculous.
[00:11:14.380 --> 00:11:19.200]   You cannot have a covenant relationship with your wife with just the head.
[00:11:19.200 --> 00:11:24.100]   Because the Bible describes Christ the head and the church is the body of Christ.
[00:11:24.100 --> 00:11:30.140]   So this word is significant because you can love people without loving God, but you cannot
[00:11:30.140 --> 00:11:33.820]   love God without loving people.
[00:11:33.820 --> 00:11:43.500]   In fact, the Bible tells us that the central identifying mark of a Christian is this love.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:47.940]   John chapter 13, 34 to 35, Jesus says, "A new commandment I give to you that you love
[00:11:47.940 --> 00:11:48.940]   one another."
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.020]   Let me stop right there.
[00:11:51.020 --> 00:11:55.160]   If you read any part of the Old Testament, you already know that this commandment to
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:58.340]   love your neighbor is not new.
[00:11:58.340 --> 00:12:01.100]   He mentions it in many places in the Old Testament.
[00:12:01.100 --> 00:12:04.060]   He told the nation of Israel to love your neighbor.
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:08.060]   But Jesus says, "This is a new commandment that I give to you that you love one another."
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:13.060]   And he qualifies it, "Even as I have loved you."
[00:12:13.060 --> 00:12:18.220]   He wasn't just talking about this generic love to love people because most people that
[00:12:18.220 --> 00:12:26.860]   I know, Christian or non-Christian, practice some level of love with somebody.
[00:12:26.860 --> 00:12:30.980]   Between husband and wife, most parents I know love their children.
[00:12:30.980 --> 00:12:33.260]   Most parents.
[00:12:33.260 --> 00:12:36.700]   Most people that I know have somebody that they love.
[00:12:36.700 --> 00:12:39.860]   He's not talking about the practice of just any kind of love.
[00:12:39.860 --> 00:12:44.920]   He's talking about this agape love, "Even as I have loved you, that you also love one
[00:12:44.920 --> 00:12:45.920]   another."
[00:12:45.920 --> 00:12:48.780]   He says, "By this."
[00:12:48.780 --> 00:12:51.020]   This is the identifying mark of a Christian.
[00:12:51.020 --> 00:12:55.900]   "By this, all men will know you are my disciples if you have love for one another."
[00:12:55.900 --> 00:13:00.180]   Let me take a step back and unpack this.
[00:13:00.180 --> 00:13:06.600]   Because when we typically think of a good Christian, we think of right theology.
[00:13:06.600 --> 00:13:09.020]   We think of church attendance.
[00:13:09.020 --> 00:13:11.020]   Maybe generosity.
[00:13:11.020 --> 00:13:13.420]   Maybe faithfulness to church.
[00:13:13.420 --> 00:13:15.180]   And there's many things that we can look at.
[00:13:15.180 --> 00:13:16.700]   Maybe certain kind of morality.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:19.140]   Maybe you don't do certain things and you do certain things.
[00:13:19.140 --> 00:13:22.100]   And so we look at all these external things and all of these things are qualities that
[00:13:22.100 --> 00:13:24.980]   the Bible says that a Christian should have.
[00:13:24.980 --> 00:13:32.340]   But above all of that, above all of that, Jesus himself said, "But the central identifying
[00:13:32.340 --> 00:13:38.620]   mark of a genuine conversion is agape love."
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:44.340]   Again he says in 1 John 3, 14, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:46.860]   we love the brethren."
[00:13:46.860 --> 00:13:51.980]   He doesn't say, "We know that we are saved because I confessed the right doctrine."
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:54.620]   Even though it is central to our faith.
[00:13:54.620 --> 00:14:02.420]   If you confessed Christ, the wrong Christ, the wrong doctrine of the gospel, you can't
[00:14:02.420 --> 00:14:04.920]   be saved because your faith is defected.
[00:14:04.920 --> 00:14:10.020]   Out of all the things that could be highlighted, he says, "The central thing that causes me
[00:14:10.020 --> 00:14:14.760]   to know that I have passed from death to life is this agape love.
[00:14:14.760 --> 00:14:19.020]   He who does not love abides in death."
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:23.560]   So the love that he is referring to is not just this any kind of love because anybody
[00:14:23.560 --> 00:14:27.280]   who practices love, "Oh, I love my kids so I must be a Christian.
[00:14:27.280 --> 00:14:30.600]   And I'm pretty generous to my neighbors so I'm a good Christian.
[00:14:30.600 --> 00:14:36.960]   I support compassion so I give to orphaned kids so I must be a Christian."
[00:14:36.960 --> 00:14:38.720]   Well that's not what he's referring to.
[00:14:38.720 --> 00:14:45.120]   He said very specifically, "As I have loved you."
[00:14:45.120 --> 00:14:53.680]   Loving people that you would not normally love if it wasn't for Christ.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.360]   In fact, it's spelled out for us.
[00:14:56.360 --> 00:15:00.500]   Jesus spells it out in Luke chapter 6, 32 to 35.
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:06.960]   If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[00:15:06.960 --> 00:15:12.320]   Because this is the love that you and I know.
[00:15:12.320 --> 00:15:16.360]   Even now, think about the friends that you have.
[00:15:16.360 --> 00:15:18.760]   Think about the social group that you belong to.
[00:15:18.760 --> 00:15:22.840]   Why are you in that social group?
[00:15:22.840 --> 00:15:26.120]   You don't need to tell me because I already know.
[00:15:26.120 --> 00:15:30.080]   It's because those people love me back.
[00:15:30.080 --> 00:15:33.820]   Those are easier people for me to love.
[00:15:33.820 --> 00:15:40.920]   If we were non-Christians, and we don't care what you think, because if you're hard to
[00:15:40.920 --> 00:15:44.720]   love, why pour any energy into that?
[00:15:44.720 --> 00:15:48.960]   I don't have anything restraining me from shunning that person, maybe even slandering
[00:15:48.960 --> 00:15:49.960]   them.
[00:15:49.960 --> 00:15:54.180]   In fact, the Bible tells us eye for an eye, tooth for a tooth, to restrain us from taking
[00:15:54.180 --> 00:16:00.040]   vengeance because he understands our natural inclination is if somebody tries to hurt me,
[00:16:00.040 --> 00:16:05.120]   that I don't just turn the other cheek, I take vengeance.
[00:16:05.120 --> 00:16:07.600]   But we're Christians.
[00:16:07.600 --> 00:16:10.400]   We're more savvy than that.
[00:16:10.400 --> 00:16:14.560]   Our church is watching, especially if you're a pastor preaching every Sunday.
[00:16:14.560 --> 00:16:16.600]   You know what I mean?
[00:16:16.600 --> 00:16:19.280]   I got to fake it good.
[00:16:19.280 --> 00:16:20.280]   So we're Christians.
[00:16:20.280 --> 00:16:22.360]   We're a bit more savvy than that.
[00:16:22.360 --> 00:16:27.760]   So what we do is we surround people that make us feel comfortable, and then the people who
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:33.400]   don't make us feel comfortable, people that we don't like, people that offend us, we keep
[00:16:33.400 --> 00:16:36.660]   them acquaintances.
[00:16:36.660 --> 00:16:42.640]   So we practice love with lovable people, and then we keep other people as acquaintances
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:44.960]   because they bother us.
[00:16:44.960 --> 00:16:54.040]   This agape love that he's talking about is not a natural thing that a common man practices.
[00:16:54.040 --> 00:16:56.860]   If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[00:16:56.860 --> 00:16:59.680]   For even the sinners love those who love them.
[00:16:59.680 --> 00:17:00.680]   Because this is not sacrificial.
[00:17:00.680 --> 00:17:02.400]   This is not agape love.
[00:17:02.400 --> 00:17:05.840]   We love because they will love us.
[00:17:05.840 --> 00:17:10.560]   If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you?
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:13.720]   Now think about what he is saying.
[00:17:13.720 --> 00:17:16.560]   That's what all of us do.
[00:17:16.560 --> 00:17:18.880]   "Oh, you remember my birthday?
[00:17:18.880 --> 00:17:21.680]   Okay, next time your birthday comes around, I'm going to remember you.
[00:17:21.680 --> 00:17:25.240]   Oh, you were kind to me, so next time, okay, I'm going to be kind to you.
[00:17:25.240 --> 00:17:27.240]   Oh, you jerk.
[00:17:27.240 --> 00:17:30.360]   I'm going to be jerk to you next time.
[00:17:30.360 --> 00:17:33.680]   I'm going to hide it so nobody can tell."
[00:17:33.680 --> 00:17:37.040]   But that's normally how we practice love.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.560]   He said, "But what credit is that?
[00:17:38.560 --> 00:17:39.980]   For even the sinners do the same.
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:46.240]   If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you?"
[00:17:46.240 --> 00:17:50.800]   What kind of a foolish business advice is this?
[00:17:50.800 --> 00:17:58.000]   If you only lend to those people who are going to pay you back, I mean, it sounds great on
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:04.720]   paper, but who would teach somebody, "That guy has poor credit.
[00:18:04.720 --> 00:18:10.180]   You've given him money before and it took him 15 years to pay you back."
[00:18:10.180 --> 00:18:11.880]   Or maybe some of them didn't even pay you back.
[00:18:11.880 --> 00:18:13.700]   He said, "What money?"
[00:18:13.700 --> 00:18:20.400]   He said, "If you only lend money to people who has a track record of giving you back
[00:18:20.400 --> 00:18:25.360]   and appreciative of what you've done," he said, "What credit is that to you?"
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:30.280]   It sounds great on paper, but in practice, it's like, "Are you serious?
[00:18:30.280 --> 00:18:34.160]   Who would lend to somebody that you know is not going to pay you back?
[00:18:34.160 --> 00:18:35.480]   Who does that?
[00:18:35.480 --> 00:18:36.480]   Who teaches that?
[00:18:36.480 --> 00:18:40.480]   And if you did practice that, no one's going to pat you on the back and say, 'Man, your
[00:18:40.480 --> 00:18:41.640]   agape love is awesome.'"
[00:18:41.640 --> 00:18:44.880]   You're going to say, "You're so foolish.
[00:18:44.880 --> 00:18:46.960]   Why would you do that?
[00:18:46.960 --> 00:18:48.960]   You're so naive.
[00:18:48.960 --> 00:18:51.560]   How would you set yourself up for that?"
[00:18:51.560 --> 00:18:54.640]   But he says, beyond that, he says, "Love your enemies."
[00:18:54.640 --> 00:18:56.980]   You know who the enemies are?
[00:18:56.980 --> 00:19:03.920]   If it's difficult to be around people who make you uncomfortable, enemies are people
[00:19:03.920 --> 00:19:10.880]   who are out to hurt you, who've made plans to slander you.
[00:19:10.880 --> 00:19:15.400]   So if we don't like being around people that makes us uncomfortable and we keep them acquaintances
[00:19:15.400 --> 00:19:19.080]   and we love people that we love, but he goes beyond that.
[00:19:19.080 --> 00:19:20.760]   This agape love takes us beyond that.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:27.320]   He says, "No, love those who are deliberately trying to hurt you, and do good and lend,
[00:19:27.320 --> 00:19:31.120]   expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:35.920]   most high God, for himself is kind to ungrateful and evil men."
[00:19:35.920 --> 00:19:44.920]   Man, you know as well as I do how difficult it is to be gracious to somebody who is ungrateful.
[00:19:44.920 --> 00:19:51.600]   Have you ever had any friend like that?
[00:19:51.600 --> 00:19:53.400]   My whole youth group was like that.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:58.040]   Yeah, Joe was in my youth group.
[00:19:58.040 --> 00:20:00.440]   What did I say?
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:01.440]   Except Joe.
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:05.440]   That's why he's an elder at our church right now.
[00:20:05.440 --> 00:20:12.280]   I remember when I was a youth pastor, my full-time pay was like $1,300 a month.
[00:20:12.280 --> 00:20:16.200]   These kids don't have money, so I would take them out to eat, and I would buy them drinks,
[00:20:16.200 --> 00:20:19.520]   and everything that I would, fix their cars.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:25.440]   And then the one time that I couldn't take them out to eat, they're like, "Oh my God,
[00:20:25.440 --> 00:20:26.440]   he doesn't care."
[00:20:26.440 --> 00:20:32.240]   I remember this one particular kid, I won't name his name, because he's not here anyway,
[00:20:32.240 --> 00:20:33.240]   you wouldn't know.
[00:20:33.240 --> 00:20:38.920]   I mean, for years I'd meet up with him, buy him food, lunch, and all this stuff, and he
[00:20:38.920 --> 00:20:41.640]   took me out to eat one time for my birthday.
[00:20:41.640 --> 00:20:45.800]   He talked about that one lunch for the next five years.
[00:20:45.800 --> 00:20:46.800]   Remember when I took you out?
[00:20:46.800 --> 00:20:50.480]   I remember in the back of my mind, it's like, "Remember the three years I invested in your
[00:20:50.480 --> 00:20:53.740]   life?"
[00:20:53.740 --> 00:20:58.560]   How hard is it to love somebody who is ungrateful?
[00:20:58.560 --> 00:21:02.920]   How hard is it to love people who are selfish?
[00:21:02.920 --> 00:21:10.600]   See the reason why the identifying mark of a genuine believer is that this agape love
[00:21:10.600 --> 00:21:16.560]   that affected us is now coming out of us, because this is not something that you and
[00:21:16.560 --> 00:21:19.800]   I can practice in our flesh.
[00:21:19.800 --> 00:21:25.760]   The evidence that you and I have become new creation is that something alien came in,
[00:21:25.760 --> 00:21:33.760]   and now it is obvious, obvious that we are Jesus' disciples because Jesus did the same.
[00:21:33.760 --> 00:21:39.760]   And that's what he says, the primary identifying mark of a genuine Christian is the practice
[00:21:39.760 --> 00:21:44.120]   of this alien love.
[00:21:44.120 --> 00:21:50.120]   That's why he's saying you can love people like everybody else loves people and not love
[00:21:50.120 --> 00:22:01.160]   God, but if you've been loved by God and you love God, you cannot possibly reject his body.
[00:22:01.160 --> 00:22:06.800]   I know how difficult this is, and I know probably some of you are already thinking in your mind
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:12.600]   this one particular person or this group of people who have wronged you.
[00:22:12.600 --> 00:22:17.640]   And it's great hearing sermons, it's great talking about it, it's great hearing about
[00:22:17.640 --> 00:22:21.760]   the love of Christ, but when you actually try to practice, are you serious?
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.160]   Who does that?
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:32.600]   See this agape love, it goes against every sense of fairness.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:38.000]   It goes against every sense of fairness and justice because we're not taught that.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:41.400]   You're not taught that if somebody hits you, turn the other cheek.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:42.400]   Who teaches that?
[00:22:42.400 --> 00:22:44.200]   Those of you who have kids, do you teach that?
[00:22:44.200 --> 00:22:49.520]   If a bully comes and bullies you at school, also give him your dinner.
[00:22:49.520 --> 00:22:55.200]   If a bully comes and punches you, take him out to ... Who teaches that to their kids?
[00:22:55.200 --> 00:22:59.600]   You teach them how to box, MMA, put him on an arm bar, make sure that he never does this
[00:22:59.600 --> 00:23:01.100]   again.
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:05.960]   It goes against everything that we know of fairness and justice.
[00:23:05.960 --> 00:23:13.560]   And so it humbles us because it is completely alien.
[00:23:13.560 --> 00:23:18.520]   There's nothing that we can measure with and say, "Oh, that's what that means," outside
[00:23:18.520 --> 00:23:21.360]   of Christ.
[00:23:21.360 --> 00:23:24.960]   It goes against our survival instinct.
[00:23:24.960 --> 00:23:29.120]   You know, right now the coronavirus is spreading all over the world, and I heard that Korea
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:30.120]   has kind of been locked down.
[00:23:30.120 --> 00:23:35.360]   I was talking to a friend and said, "This mega church, they're sending out emails telling
[00:23:35.360 --> 00:23:38.460]   people not to come to church because they're afraid.
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:40.860]   They're afraid that it's going to spread."
[00:23:40.860 --> 00:23:46.260]   Our IMB missionaries, our denomination sent millions of dollars pulling missionaries out
[00:23:46.260 --> 00:23:51.940]   of China and spread them all over Asia to keep them safe for a period.
[00:23:51.940 --> 00:23:56.100]   Whenever we think that something is going to harm us, our natural instinct to survive
[00:23:56.100 --> 00:23:58.280]   is to stay away.
[00:23:58.280 --> 00:24:03.340]   So if you're buying a house and you find out your neighbor is a crack addict or it's a
[00:24:03.340 --> 00:24:09.780]   crack house, immediately you're not going to buy that house, right?
[00:24:09.780 --> 00:24:12.780]   Because our natural instinct is to be safe.
[00:24:12.780 --> 00:24:17.460]   See, people who are ungrateful, people who are our enemies, people who are deliberately
[00:24:17.460 --> 00:24:27.580]   out to get us, these are people who will fight against our natural instinct to be safe.
[00:24:27.580 --> 00:24:36.100]   And yet, the practice of agape love forces us to be in situation where it is unsafe for
[00:24:36.100 --> 00:24:38.020]   us.
[00:24:38.020 --> 00:24:43.120]   So it goes against our natural survival instinct.
[00:24:43.120 --> 00:24:44.120]   Every single one of us.
[00:24:44.120 --> 00:24:47.980]   You know, some of you guys, and I told you that I'm not a big fan of Disneyland.
[00:24:47.980 --> 00:24:49.300]   It doesn't make me happy.
[00:24:49.300 --> 00:24:51.260]   It's just the happiest.
[00:24:51.260 --> 00:24:53.100]   Some of you, it makes you very happy.
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:55.020]   It makes me tired.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:57.940]   Even the thought of going to Disneyland, right?
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:25:03.100]   Again, this isn't, nothing innately wrong with Disneyland, but just for me personally
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:11.860]   and my wife, I think, we, like the thought of being around all those people walking around,
[00:25:11.860 --> 00:25:17.340]   because I don't get enough joy from riding those rides to put up with all these other
[00:25:17.340 --> 00:25:18.340]   stuff.
[00:25:18.340 --> 00:25:19.860]   And some of you guys do.
[00:25:19.860 --> 00:25:23.460]   The rides are good enough or it makes you happy enough to go.
[00:25:23.460 --> 00:25:27.100]   Our natural instinct is, when you take vacation, you want to go there because it makes you
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:28.100]   happy.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:29.540]   If it doesn't make you happy, you're not going to go.
[00:25:29.540 --> 00:25:33.100]   And that's the way we make decisions about everything.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.100]   Does it make you happy?
[00:25:34.100 --> 00:25:35.300]   Does it not make you happy?
[00:25:35.300 --> 00:25:38.340]   You choose certain places to vacation.
[00:25:38.340 --> 00:25:40.460]   Because if I go there, it makes me happy.
[00:25:40.460 --> 00:25:42.740]   If I go eat that, it makes me happy.
[00:25:42.740 --> 00:25:44.820]   If I do this, it doesn't make me happy.
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.020]   And that's how we make decisions.
[00:25:47.020 --> 00:25:57.820]   But this agape love, at the core of it, causes us to be unhappy, to be surrounded by people
[00:25:57.820 --> 00:26:03.260]   that are difficult to love, and to make a deliberate choice to be in that situation
[00:26:03.260 --> 00:26:10.120]   and to reach out and to practice this love that Jesus practiced with us.
[00:26:10.120 --> 00:26:15.860]   That's why this is an alien love, because we don't practice this.
[00:26:15.860 --> 00:26:21.820]   Not only do we not practice this, we don't value this.
[00:26:21.820 --> 00:26:25.020]   If you lend to people who aren't going to lend to you, if you are gracious and spend
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:29.180]   a lot of it to people who are not going to be grateful to you, if you put yourself in
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:35.260]   a situation where your enemy can attack you and you're vulnerable, you're dumb.
[00:26:35.260 --> 00:26:38.060]   People aren't going to praise you for that.
[00:26:38.060 --> 00:26:41.980]   The only people, when you truly understand this agape love, are the people where the
[00:26:41.980 --> 00:26:45.840]   love of God caused us to open our eyes.
[00:26:45.840 --> 00:26:52.100]   That's why the Bible tells us that the gospel is foolishness to those who are perishing.
[00:26:52.100 --> 00:26:53.100]   It is foolishness.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:57.420]   You know, sometimes that we've been Christians for so long, we don't understand how it sounds
[00:26:57.420 --> 00:26:59.700]   to a non-Christian.
[00:26:59.700 --> 00:27:00.700]   Why wouldn't you?
[00:27:00.700 --> 00:27:03.300]   Jesus loves you so much.
[00:27:03.300 --> 00:27:05.340]   Why wouldn't you believe him?
[00:27:05.340 --> 00:27:09.980]   If you think of it from a non-Christian's perspective, it's like, we were blaspheming
[00:27:09.980 --> 00:27:18.620]   his name, we deserve hell, but he sent his only begotten son and died for me, gave me
[00:27:18.620 --> 00:27:25.140]   eternal life, made me his adopted child, co-heirs with Christ, and then as a result, if you
[00:27:25.140 --> 00:27:31.140]   believe that to practice with other people, that's foolish.
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:34.940]   You want me to accept this and change my life and my destiny based upon this message?
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:40.580]   He says it's foolishness to those who are perishing, but to those who believe, it is
[00:27:40.580 --> 00:27:43.500]   the power of God.
[00:27:43.500 --> 00:27:48.040]   And that is the central power that changed us.
[00:27:48.040 --> 00:27:53.220]   And that's the central power that exists in genuine believers that causes us to build
[00:27:53.220 --> 00:27:58.900]   this community with people that sometimes naturally would make us feel uncomfortable.
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:04.480]   And that's why he says the central mark of a Christian is that.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:12.100]   You know, the best example of this, the change of this agape power, from this agape power,
[00:28:12.100 --> 00:28:13.860]   is the New Testament itself.
[00:28:13.860 --> 00:28:19.260]   Who is known as the apostle of love?
[00:28:19.260 --> 00:28:21.500]   You guys memorizing 1 John?
[00:28:21.500 --> 00:28:23.500]   Who's the apostle of love?
[00:28:23.500 --> 00:28:24.500]   John.
[00:28:24.500 --> 00:28:25.500]   John.
[00:28:25.500 --> 00:28:26.500]   John, right?
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:31.780]   I know you knew it.
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:34.940]   You guys are just being Asian.
[00:28:34.940 --> 00:28:36.740]   Alright.
[00:28:36.740 --> 00:28:41.820]   John is known as the apostle of love.
[00:28:41.820 --> 00:28:49.260]   Because he wrote 1st, 2nd, 3rd John, he wrote the Gospel of John, and there's more teaching,
[00:28:49.260 --> 00:28:56.320]   more commands about this agape, unconditional love, from apostle John than any other apostle.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:29:01.300]   But you know what apostle John was known for?
[00:29:01.300 --> 00:29:05.940]   You know what he was known for before he wrote these Gospels?
[00:29:05.940 --> 00:29:09.380]   Luke chapter 9, 51 through 56.
[00:29:09.380 --> 00:29:15.220]   Before I get there, John and James' nickname, John and his brother James' nickname was sons
[00:29:15.220 --> 00:29:16.580]   of what?
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.700]   Thunder.
[00:29:17.700 --> 00:29:20.020]   Sons of Thunder.
[00:29:20.020 --> 00:29:22.500]   You don't get that nickname for being gentle.
[00:29:22.500 --> 00:29:25.580]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:26.580]   Sons of Thunder.
[00:29:26.580 --> 00:29:32.180]   Thunder is not when you think of peaceful, quiet vacations, like thunder.
[00:29:32.180 --> 00:29:37.340]   Sons of Thunder automatically means these guys probably hot tempered.
[00:29:37.340 --> 00:29:41.820]   And these guys are built for thunder.
[00:29:41.820 --> 00:29:43.500]   That's what that means, right?
[00:29:43.500 --> 00:29:46.700]   And we see an example in Luke chapter 9, 51 through 56.
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:52.180]   When the days were approaching for his ascension, he was determined to go to Jerusalem, and
[00:29:52.180 --> 00:29:53.940]   he sent messengers ahead of him.
[00:29:53.940 --> 00:29:58.580]   So Jesus is preparing to go to Jerusalem, to go to the cross, and then he sent his disciples
[00:29:58.580 --> 00:30:03.060]   to go ahead and prepare that he was going to go through Samaria, and then he was going
[00:30:03.060 --> 00:30:04.980]   to get to Jerusalem.
[00:30:04.980 --> 00:30:09.420]   When they went and entered a village of the Samaritans to make arrangements, and the Jews
[00:30:09.420 --> 00:30:11.060]   naturally did not get along.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:15.580]   They have a long history, hundreds of years of animosity toward one another.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:19.580]   Because the Jews considered the Samaritans to be compromised.
[00:30:19.580 --> 00:30:24.100]   So some of the Jews, when the Babylonians and Assyrians took them into captivity, some
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:28.040]   of the Jews stayed and they intermarried with the Assyrians.
[00:30:28.040 --> 00:30:30.800]   So they were considered unclean.
[00:30:30.800 --> 00:30:36.160]   So even though they wanted to be seen as Jews, the Jews saw them as Gentiles.
[00:30:36.160 --> 00:30:37.240]   So they were natural enemies.
[00:30:37.240 --> 00:30:41.680]   So when somebody is coming from Galilee, let's say Galilee and Jerusalem is kind of like
[00:30:41.680 --> 00:30:43.860]   NorCal and SoCal, right?
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:49.620]   And in order to get to SoCal, you need to go through Bakersfield.
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:53.680]   So Bakersfield, Samaria, as an example.
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:57.620]   So typically, because they didn't want to go through Bakersfield, they would go all
[00:30:57.620 --> 00:31:00.260]   the way around.
[00:31:00.260 --> 00:31:04.460]   They would go all the way around, and it may take an extra half a day or a day's journey,
[00:31:04.460 --> 00:31:08.020]   but that's how much they hated each other.
[00:31:08.020 --> 00:31:10.620]   Jesus decides to go through Bakersfield.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.620]   They go through Samaria.
[00:31:11.620 --> 00:31:14.180]   And in Samaria, he said, "These guys are going to Jerusalem.
[00:31:14.180 --> 00:31:16.700]   We're not going to help these guys."
[00:31:16.700 --> 00:31:21.340]   And so it triggers James and John in verse 54.
[00:31:21.340 --> 00:31:25.140]   When his disciples James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do you want us to command
[00:31:25.140 --> 00:31:27.180]   fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:32.660]   Let me stop right there.
[00:31:32.660 --> 00:31:37.180]   Sometimes we read the Bible like we're reading some kind of fairy tale.
[00:31:37.180 --> 00:31:42.060]   And so we read it and say, "Jack and the Beanstalk went and it grew and went to heaven."
[00:31:42.060 --> 00:31:49.460]   And we read that like we're reading a fairy tale, not realizing sometimes this is real.
[00:31:49.460 --> 00:31:51.260]   This is an actual event that happened.
[00:31:51.260 --> 00:31:53.340]   So think about it for a second.
[00:31:53.340 --> 00:31:56.020]   Sometimes you could just read that as, "Oh, they wanted to kill everybody."
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.020]   And then they moved on.
[00:31:57.020 --> 00:32:00.420]   Look at the way he says that.
[00:32:00.420 --> 00:32:03.260]   "Oh, they don't want to help us.
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:06.380]   Lord, you want me to kill all of them right now?"
[00:32:06.380 --> 00:32:09.540]   That's basically what he is saying.
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:13.180]   The way he says it, it sounds like he did it before.
[00:32:13.180 --> 00:32:14.940]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:32:14.940 --> 00:32:16.460]   Look at it.
[00:32:16.460 --> 00:32:17.460]   He says it so casually.
[00:32:17.460 --> 00:32:20.820]   "Oh, they're not going to help us.
[00:32:20.820 --> 00:32:25.940]   Should I kill all of them right now?"
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.700]   Does he have the power to bring fire from heaven?
[00:32:28.700 --> 00:32:30.720]   I don't know.
[00:32:30.720 --> 00:32:33.580]   Maybe that's why they call them sons of thunder, maybe because they did it before.
[00:32:33.580 --> 00:32:35.980]   I don't know.
[00:32:35.980 --> 00:32:39.900]   But he's like, "Okay, this is our Messiah.
[00:32:39.900 --> 00:32:43.020]   How dare they not honor him?
[00:32:43.020 --> 00:32:45.820]   Who do they think they are?
[00:32:45.820 --> 00:32:46.820]   Kill them."
[00:32:46.820 --> 00:32:49.500]   Look what Jesus says.
[00:32:49.500 --> 00:32:53.020]   But he turned and rebuked them and he said, "You do not know what kind of spirit you are
[00:32:53.020 --> 00:32:54.020]   of."
[00:32:54.020 --> 00:32:57.740]   What does he mean by that?
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:33:00.460]   You don't really know me.
[00:33:00.460 --> 00:33:02.320]   That's what he was saying.
[00:33:02.320 --> 00:33:03.940]   You don't really know me.
[00:33:03.940 --> 00:33:09.420]   For the Son of Man did not come to destroy man's lives, but to save them.
[00:33:09.420 --> 00:33:11.660]   And then it just says, "And then they went on their way.
[00:33:11.660 --> 00:33:16.940]   And then they just walked to Jerusalem."
[00:33:16.940 --> 00:33:20.180]   That's the apostle of love.
[00:33:20.180 --> 00:33:22.300]   That's the apostle of love.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:25.300]   Even after that, as they were coming, Jesus was saying, "I'm going to go be crucified and
[00:33:25.300 --> 00:33:26.620]   be raised up on the third day."
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:29.380]   And James and John could not get this out of their head.
[00:33:29.380 --> 00:33:32.860]   "Well, who's going to sit on your left and who's going to sit on the right?"
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:34.900]   In fact, they sent their mom.
[00:33:34.900 --> 00:33:37.260]   Their mommy went to talk to the Messiah.
[00:33:37.260 --> 00:33:44.660]   "Would you, in your glorified, let my son sit on the left and to the right?"
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:48.100]   So James and John, their mindset was like anybody else.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.020]   "We sacrifice to follow you.
[00:33:50.020 --> 00:33:52.980]   What do we get out of this?
[00:33:52.980 --> 00:33:54.140]   We're following the Messiah.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:56.260]   How dare they dishonor us?
[00:33:56.260 --> 00:33:58.620]   Kill them all."
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:03.260]   How did that guy become the apostle of love?
[00:34:03.260 --> 00:34:07.780]   Well, he himself says it in 1 John 4, 7.
[00:34:07.780 --> 00:34:12.580]   "Beloved, let us love one another, for love is from God.
[00:34:12.580 --> 00:34:17.020]   And everyone who loves is born of God and knows God.
[00:34:17.020 --> 00:34:22.860]   The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:28.580]   Do you think that as Apostle John was writing this, that he was thinking about that incident?
[00:34:28.580 --> 00:34:36.020]   "Let us love, for love is from God."
[00:34:36.020 --> 00:34:38.580]   It wasn't from him.
[00:34:38.580 --> 00:34:39.900]   It wasn't something that he conjured up.
[00:34:39.900 --> 00:34:44.500]   It wasn't because he was discipled, he was sanctified, and somehow he became this love.
[00:34:44.500 --> 00:34:47.660]   He said, "No, love was given to me.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:50.060]   I didn't have this.
[00:34:50.060 --> 00:34:54.980]   Everyone who loves is born of God and knows God, because that's the evidence that he is
[00:34:54.980 --> 00:34:59.180]   with God, because this love wasn't taught by your mom.
[00:34:59.180 --> 00:35:01.340]   It wasn't taught by your dad.
[00:35:01.340 --> 00:35:03.880]   It wasn't taught because you went to a good school.
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:07.160]   It wasn't taught because you had a good discipler.
[00:35:07.160 --> 00:35:14.100]   This can only be taught by God, because only God himself practices love."
[00:35:14.100 --> 00:35:18.060]   And he said, "That's the true evidence.
[00:35:18.060 --> 00:35:23.660]   Who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
[00:35:23.660 --> 00:35:27.300]   Do you think when he was writing this that he remembered what Jesus said?
[00:35:27.300 --> 00:35:31.260]   "You don't know me.
[00:35:31.260 --> 00:35:34.180]   That's not what I came to do."
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:41.560]   First John 4, 19, "We love because he first loved us."
[00:35:41.560 --> 00:35:46.860]   This is not one of many things that the church needs to get right.
[00:35:46.860 --> 00:35:54.300]   We need discipleship, we need evangelism, missions, right theology.
[00:35:54.300 --> 00:36:01.460]   All of these things are crucial to the church, but at the center of all of that is agape
[00:36:01.460 --> 00:36:03.460]   love.
[00:36:03.460 --> 00:36:06.060]   Even Apostle Paul.
[00:36:06.060 --> 00:36:08.060]   You know who Apostle Paul was?
[00:36:08.060 --> 00:36:14.420]   He was the one responsible for the first martyr of the church, but that wasn't enough.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:20.900]   He instigated his friends to go after all the Christians.
[00:36:20.900 --> 00:36:26.860]   He couldn't stand the fact that their Messiah and the kingdom of God that only belonged
[00:36:26.860 --> 00:36:31.140]   to the Jews was beginning to open to the Gentiles.
[00:36:31.140 --> 00:36:35.300]   And by his own description, when he talked about righteousness before he met Christ,
[00:36:35.300 --> 00:36:37.500]   he said, "As for Zeal," what does he say?
[00:36:37.500 --> 00:36:40.740]   "Persecutor of the church."
[00:36:40.740 --> 00:36:43.620]   He hated the Gentiles.
[00:36:43.620 --> 00:36:49.820]   And he was willing to even go to jail and even be martyred for this cause because it
[00:36:49.820 --> 00:36:55.380]   was against Roman law for him to kill people without a trial.
[00:36:55.380 --> 00:36:56.740]   And he was willing to do that.
[00:36:56.740 --> 00:36:58.260]   That's how zealous he was.
[00:36:58.260 --> 00:37:01.900]   That's how much he hated the Gentiles.
[00:37:01.900 --> 00:37:06.580]   And yet, Apostle Paul was called to be the apostle of who?
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:07.580]   The Gentiles.
[00:37:07.580 --> 00:37:08.580]   Why?
[00:37:08.580 --> 00:37:13.660]   Well, Paul says it himself.
[00:37:13.660 --> 00:37:15.820]   Because he wasn't trying to magnify Paul's education.
[00:37:15.820 --> 00:37:21.020]   He wasn't trying to magnify Paul's Roman citizenship or his great learning.
[00:37:21.020 --> 00:37:26.020]   He said, "No, he was chosen because he was the worst of sinners."
[00:37:26.020 --> 00:37:28.500]   To magnify who?
[00:37:28.500 --> 00:37:31.580]   God's agape love.
[00:37:31.580 --> 00:37:40.980]   See, when we truly understand the love of God, it automatically humbles us because that's
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.900]   the nature of agape love.
[00:37:43.900 --> 00:37:51.140]   A proud Christian is a man who does not know God because it is a contradictory of term.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:57.940]   If your education causes you to be proud, your education has led you away from Christ.
[00:37:57.940 --> 00:38:03.860]   If your fruitfulness has caused you to be proud, those fruits are ultimately not from
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:11.540]   God because at the core of who we worship is this agape love that is alien, that we
[00:38:11.540 --> 00:38:14.780]   don't understand and yet we believe.
[00:38:14.780 --> 00:38:21.340]   And it is that alien love that affects us, that causes us to be different.
[00:38:21.340 --> 00:38:28.700]   Again, as I said, this is not one of many important things in the church.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:32.620]   It is the foundation of the church itself.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:36.740]   And that's why the scripture says, "Of love, faith, and hope."
[00:38:36.740 --> 00:38:38.380]   We're saved by faith.
[00:38:38.380 --> 00:38:40.100]   Hope is the reason why we persevere.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:45.300]   But of these things, the greatest is love.
[00:38:45.300 --> 00:38:47.900]   The greatest is love.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:53.660]   Sometimes in the church, we can get busy discipling, wanting to be holy, getting the doctrines
[00:38:53.660 --> 00:38:57.980]   right, sharing the gospel, and there's so many things that can wrap our time and keep
[00:38:57.980 --> 00:38:58.980]   us busy.
[00:38:58.980 --> 00:39:06.860]   And all of these things are very, very, very important because obedience to God is important.
[00:39:06.860 --> 00:39:17.160]   But the Bible also says you can do all of that and have not love and it means nothing.
[00:39:17.160 --> 00:39:20.100]   You can speak tongues of men and of angels.
[00:39:20.100 --> 00:39:24.900]   You can have had a holy spiritual encounter with God that causes you to speak tongues
[00:39:24.900 --> 00:39:28.940]   of men and of angels and have not love, it's nothing.
[00:39:28.940 --> 00:39:33.540]   You can have everything that you own and you sell and you give it to the poor.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:38.420]   If you do not practice agape love, it means nothing.
[00:39:38.420 --> 00:39:43.860]   You can even give your body to be burned as a martyr for the purpose of the gospel and
[00:39:43.860 --> 00:39:46.700]   have not love.
[00:39:46.700 --> 00:39:50.640]   Even then, that's so hard to understand.
[00:39:50.640 --> 00:39:57.400]   Why would somebody be willing to give their life and then at the end of it, God says it
[00:39:57.400 --> 00:40:00.480]   was nothing.
[00:40:00.480 --> 00:40:05.680]   Think about the terrorists who are willing to give their life for what we believe to
[00:40:05.680 --> 00:40:07.760]   be a lie.
[00:40:07.760 --> 00:40:12.820]   There's people who are complete atheists who set themselves on fire in protest of government
[00:40:12.820 --> 00:40:17.880]   because they want something and they want to go out in glory.
[00:40:17.880 --> 00:40:21.720]   Paul is saying this to the Corinthians church in 1 Corinthians 13 because he was talking
[00:40:21.720 --> 00:40:26.880]   to a group of people who were competing with each other for righteousness.
[00:40:26.880 --> 00:40:29.040]   Who's more holy?
[00:40:29.040 --> 00:40:30.800]   Who's got the doctrines right?
[00:40:30.800 --> 00:40:32.760]   Who's on the right side?
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:33.760]   Is it Paul?
[00:40:33.760 --> 00:40:35.240]   Is it Apollos?
[00:40:35.240 --> 00:40:36.640]   Who's saying the right things?
[00:40:36.640 --> 00:40:38.520]   Who should we align ourselves to?
[00:40:38.520 --> 00:40:43.060]   So Apostle Paul is telling this church who's divided because they're not practicing this
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:45.300]   love and he said you can have all of that.
[00:40:45.300 --> 00:40:46.700]   You can be under the right person.
[00:40:46.700 --> 00:40:48.060]   You can be at the right church.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:50.060]   You can say the right things, do the right things.
[00:40:50.060 --> 00:40:58.940]   And he says yet if you do not have this love, you missed the whole point of our salvation.
[00:40:58.940 --> 00:41:07.180]   Because the central mark of a church is not the number, is not the quality of the preaching,
[00:41:07.180 --> 00:41:13.220]   is not how well we duplicate ourselves, how well it's organized, is not the doctrinal
[00:41:13.220 --> 00:41:15.340]   statement that we sign.
[00:41:15.340 --> 00:41:19.680]   Again, all of these things are things that God calls us to do.
[00:41:19.680 --> 00:41:27.380]   But the central mark of a Christian is this agape love, this alien love.
[00:41:27.380 --> 00:41:31.280]   That's why he says a new commandment I give to you, that you love one another as I have
[00:41:31.280 --> 00:41:32.660]   loved you.
[00:41:32.660 --> 00:41:41.740]   And if you do this, then the world will know that you are my disciples.
[00:41:41.740 --> 00:41:50.380]   I pray as a church, I really feel like we're kind of at a point in our church where I told
[00:41:50.380 --> 00:41:55.220]   our leaders and I think the India team that we went to, I feel like we're kind of in stage
[00:41:55.220 --> 00:41:57.580]   four, round four.
[00:41:57.580 --> 00:42:00.620]   At least that's kind of how I feel.
[00:42:00.620 --> 00:42:05.180]   It's ideological, like oh, we're going to change the world for Jesus Christ.
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:09.860]   I've been a ministry long enough to know that's not in my power.
[00:42:09.860 --> 00:42:12.460]   And then round two is you get beat up.
[00:42:12.460 --> 00:42:16.500]   Oh shoot, I might lose.
[00:42:16.500 --> 00:42:18.500]   That's round two.
[00:42:18.500 --> 00:42:24.060]   Round three is kind of like, okay, let's do it, let's get second wind.
[00:42:24.060 --> 00:42:27.820]   And we're going to go back into this fight and we're going to do this.
[00:42:27.820 --> 00:42:32.380]   And you realize just like round one, you get punched in the face and it's like wow, this
[00:42:32.380 --> 00:42:33.380]   is hard.
[00:42:33.380 --> 00:42:41.580]   And so round four, it feels like to me that it's more of a commitment to finish the race.
[00:42:41.580 --> 00:42:46.100]   I started this, so we're going to finish this.
[00:42:46.100 --> 00:42:48.900]   Because it's worth the fight.
[00:42:48.900 --> 00:42:57.620]   But at the center of this fight is not world evangelization.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:03.500]   Is not get everybody to study the Bible and memorize Genesis to Revelation.
[00:43:03.500 --> 00:43:06.700]   Disciple, raise up leaders, plant churches.
[00:43:06.700 --> 00:43:07.780]   All of these things are important.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:11.900]   All of these things that we want to do, we plan to do.
[00:43:11.900 --> 00:43:15.140]   Social justice is important, is very important.
[00:43:15.140 --> 00:43:18.740]   I'm going to be talking about that next week.
[00:43:18.740 --> 00:43:27.700]   But above all of that, if we have a church that is cold toward Christ, and that is being
[00:43:27.700 --> 00:43:33.860]   manifested in the coldness in the way that we practice love with one another, then we
[00:43:33.860 --> 00:43:38.100]   miss the whole point of why we're here.
[00:43:38.100 --> 00:43:47.220]   So my prayer and my encouragement as we go to the next stage of our church, to think
[00:43:47.220 --> 00:43:49.980]   practically.
[00:43:49.980 --> 00:43:52.740]   So again, this is easy to preach.
[00:43:52.740 --> 00:43:53.740]   It's easy to preach.
[00:43:53.740 --> 00:43:56.860]   There's so much material in the Bible.
[00:43:56.860 --> 00:44:00.980]   But think about that person that you've been stiff-arming.
[00:44:00.980 --> 00:44:03.780]   Think about that group of people that made you feel uncomfortable and that you've been
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:06.740]   kind of keeping at a distance.
[00:44:06.740 --> 00:44:12.740]   Think about the acquaintances in your life because these people make you feel uncomfortable.
[00:44:12.740 --> 00:44:16.140]   Because that's where the application needs to be.
[00:44:16.140 --> 00:44:18.900]   It might be with your wife.
[00:44:18.900 --> 00:44:20.460]   It might be with your husband.
[00:44:20.460 --> 00:44:23.380]   It might be with your kids.
[00:44:23.380 --> 00:44:29.660]   It might be with your neighbor, your co-worker, your mom, your dad, your brother, your sister.
[00:44:29.660 --> 00:44:34.460]   It might be with the person sitting next to you.
[00:44:34.460 --> 00:44:38.500]   That that's where the rubber meets the road.
[00:44:38.500 --> 00:44:43.780]   To love Christ and then to love others.
[00:44:43.780 --> 00:44:45.940]   That Christ may be glorified.
[00:44:45.940 --> 00:44:52.900]   Let's pray.
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:58.340]   Heavenly Father, we know we are weak.
[00:44:58.340 --> 00:45:01.620]   We are inspired by your love.
[00:45:01.620 --> 00:45:08.020]   We are changed by the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:45:08.020 --> 00:45:14.220]   Yet our flesh struggles to bear fruit in this way.
[00:45:14.220 --> 00:45:22.060]   Help us, Lord God, to magnify you that the world may truly know that Christ is our Lord.
[00:45:22.060 --> 00:45:25.580]   Help us as a church, Lord God, above everything else that we would be known to be people who
[00:45:25.580 --> 00:45:30.860]   love one another with the love that Christ has given us.
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:33.740]   May Christ in his name alone be magnified.
[00:45:33.740 --> 00:45:35.740]   In Jesus' name we pray.
