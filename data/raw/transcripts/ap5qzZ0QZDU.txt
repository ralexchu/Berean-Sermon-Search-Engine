[00:14:43.640 --> 00:14:46.640]   I want to welcome you to this morning's service.
[00:14:46.640 --> 00:14:48.640]   Those of you who are joining us for the first time,
[00:14:48.640 --> 00:14:50.640]   I want to extend a warm welcome to you.
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:53.640]   After the service is done, please swing by our welcome booth.
[00:14:53.640 --> 00:14:57.640]   You'll see the blue canopy and our team members with the blue lanyards.
[00:14:57.640 --> 00:15:00.640]   We'd love to meet you, and if you have any questions,
[00:15:00.640 --> 00:15:03.640]   just guide your way on how to get integrated into the church.
[00:15:03.640 --> 00:15:07.640]   Also, for the newcomers, we have a special lunch
[00:15:07.640 --> 00:15:09.640]   that's going to take place on Sunday the 26th,
[00:15:09.640 --> 00:15:11.640]   so a couple weeks from now.
[00:15:11.640 --> 00:15:17.640]   And we ask that you just show up to the sanctuary at 1:15 p.m.
[00:15:17.640 --> 00:15:21.640]   No later than 1:30 we'll get started with an informal lunch to greet you.
[00:15:21.640 --> 00:15:24.640]   You'll have opportunities to meet some of our leaders and core members.
[00:15:24.640 --> 00:15:28.640]   And I'll also be giving a presentation about just the core and philosophy
[00:15:28.640 --> 00:15:32.640]   of our ministry, so it'll be a great time for you to come and participate.
[00:15:32.640 --> 00:15:36.640]   You can sign up and give a heads up by emailing
[00:15:36.640 --> 00:15:41.640]   welcometeam@briancc.com or just give a simple visit over at the booth.
[00:15:41.640 --> 00:15:44.640]   Another announcement is that tonight the college students
[00:15:44.640 --> 00:15:49.640]   will be having their college study hall from Sunday today to Tuesday
[00:15:49.640 --> 00:15:51.640]   from 6 p.m. to 2 a.m.
[00:15:51.640 --> 00:15:55.640]   It's a great opportunity for people in the other ministries to swing by
[00:15:55.640 --> 00:15:59.640]   if you'd like to drop off some snacks, some goodies.
[00:15:59.640 --> 00:16:02.640]   Over in the cafe there will be a place designated for that,
[00:16:02.640 --> 00:16:04.640]   so please go ahead and do that.
[00:16:04.640 --> 00:16:08.640]   You can also sign up to do that too on the link provided on the app.
[00:16:08.640 --> 00:16:11.640]   Something that's also happening on Sunday the 26th
[00:16:11.640 --> 00:16:14.640]   is a summer maintenance day.
[00:16:14.640 --> 00:16:18.640]   Just periodically we have a day where we can clean up,
[00:16:18.640 --> 00:16:21.640]   take care of any clutter, requires no skill,
[00:16:21.640 --> 00:16:25.640]   just show up and participate in some good manual labor.
[00:16:25.640 --> 00:16:27.640]   You can sign up. There's a link for you on the app.
[00:16:27.640 --> 00:16:29.640]   And if you have any questions, please email
[00:16:29.640 --> 00:16:32.640]   breinlogistics@gmail.com.
[00:16:32.640 --> 00:16:37.640]   The final announcement is that we've been highlighting some special sign-ups
[00:16:37.640 --> 00:16:39.640]   over the course of the last several weeks.
[00:16:39.640 --> 00:16:42.640]   And one of those things was our family ministry retreat.
[00:16:42.640 --> 00:16:47.640]   Just as a heads up, the final day to sign up is going to be the 12th,
[00:16:47.640 --> 00:16:49.640]   which is next week.
[00:16:49.640 --> 00:16:51.640]   That's going to be the early registration.
[00:16:51.640 --> 00:16:55.640]   And then after that there's going to be an increase in the retreat fees.
[00:16:55.640 --> 00:17:00.640]   Please know we're going to be highlighting the subjects of family and marriage,
[00:17:00.640 --> 00:17:04.640]   related to both the vision of marriage and communication in the family,
[00:17:04.640 --> 00:17:05.640]   that kind of thing.
[00:17:05.640 --> 00:17:09.640]   So please make sure you take time to sign up for that as well.
[00:17:09.640 --> 00:17:14.640]   Today, after our worship time, we have the privilege of hearing
[00:17:14.640 --> 00:17:18.640]   Daniela Park come up and give her testimony, and she'll be baptized today.
[00:17:18.640 --> 00:17:20.640]   At this time, let's take a moment to pray.
[00:17:20.640 --> 00:17:25.640]   We'll pray over our offering.
[00:17:25.640 --> 00:17:28.640]   Lord, we truly want to thank you, God.
[00:17:28.640 --> 00:17:32.640]   The opportunity for us to come together to worship, we realize,
[00:17:32.640 --> 00:17:36.640]   and acknowledge to you, God, is such a sweet privilege for us.
[00:17:36.640 --> 00:17:42.640]   By the faith you have granted, by the sacrifice of Jesus Christ,
[00:17:42.640 --> 00:17:47.640]   we're united, we're brought together, and afforded this access to you.
[00:17:47.640 --> 00:17:51.640]   And we recognize, God, that as much as we desire to lift up to you our service,
[00:17:51.640 --> 00:17:55.640]   our hearts, and our song, we are all the more blessed for it.
[00:17:55.640 --> 00:17:58.640]   And so we truly do want to render to you all of our heart.
[00:17:58.640 --> 00:18:01.640]   We pray, Father, for the offering as well,
[00:18:01.640 --> 00:18:05.640]   that that would simply be an extension of that kind of desire to express to you
[00:18:05.640 --> 00:18:09.640]   our gratitude, to lift up to you everything we have,
[00:18:09.640 --> 00:18:12.640]   and a desire to continue to further your kingdom.
[00:18:12.640 --> 00:18:15.640]   So we pray that you would have your blessings over the offering as well.
[00:18:15.640 --> 00:18:19.640]   This morning, Lord, as we lift up to you our joint voices,
[00:18:19.640 --> 00:18:22.640]   we do pray, God, that you would be honored and pleased.
[00:18:22.640 --> 00:18:25.640]   It's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.

[00:27:46.540 --> 00:28:01.180]   - Hello, my name is Dani.
[00:28:01.180 --> 00:28:03.300]   Some of you know me as Daniella.
[00:28:03.300 --> 00:28:06.460]   I'm very thankful to be sharing my testimony today.
[00:28:06.460 --> 00:28:10.680]   I just wanted to start off with the word holy.
[00:28:11.580 --> 00:28:13.500]   R.C. Sproul defines the word to mean
[00:28:13.500 --> 00:28:16.220]   an infinite cut above everything else,
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:18.620]   transcendentally separate.
[00:28:18.620 --> 00:28:20.020]   And growing up in the church,
[00:28:20.020 --> 00:28:23.180]   I boastfully used the word so casually,
[00:28:23.180 --> 00:28:24.820]   believing it only meant pure,
[00:28:24.820 --> 00:28:28.020]   not knowing the depth that goes beyond that.
[00:28:28.020 --> 00:28:30.820]   It describes not only God's attributes,
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:33.420]   but also depicts our depravity.
[00:28:33.420 --> 00:28:35.340]   And in this world full of filth and death,
[00:28:35.340 --> 00:28:39.260]   our God is the only being full of life and holiness.
[00:28:39.260 --> 00:28:41.360]   And until I understood just how great
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:43.780]   the chasm between God and myself was,
[00:28:43.780 --> 00:28:46.340]   I was a wretch with no hope.
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:48.700]   And growing up in a Christian household,
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:51.940]   I mistook my head knowledge for true saving faith.
[00:28:51.940 --> 00:28:55.580]   But in reality, I didn't have the slightest clue
[00:28:55.580 --> 00:28:58.380]   of what it meant to serve a holy God.
[00:28:58.380 --> 00:29:01.100]   From a young age, I lived for myself,
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:04.340]   and the approval of man enslaved to fear
[00:29:04.340 --> 00:29:07.680]   of disappointing my parents and others around me.
[00:29:07.680 --> 00:29:10.460]   And this led to difficult times during high school
[00:29:10.460 --> 00:29:13.360]   where the desire to succeed out of pride
[00:29:13.360 --> 00:29:15.500]   brought nothing but tears, arguments,
[00:29:15.500 --> 00:29:17.540]   and a nightly prayer to wake up in heaven
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:20.100]   the next time I opened my eyes.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:23.320]   But even that cry of desperation was full of nothing
[00:29:23.320 --> 00:29:26.660]   but worldly sorrow where I only saw my pain
[00:29:26.660 --> 00:29:28.720]   and failed to remember God's constant
[00:29:28.720 --> 00:29:30.180]   and ever providing love,
[00:29:30.180 --> 00:29:34.100]   as well as his sovereign will that goes beyond those nights.
[00:29:34.100 --> 00:29:36.380]   In my junior year, I read through the book of James
[00:29:36.380 --> 00:29:38.080]   with a friend, and for the first time,
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:41.780]   I began to understand how my life is meant for others
[00:29:41.780 --> 00:29:43.380]   and not myself.
[00:29:43.380 --> 00:29:45.260]   I didn't get the complete picture
[00:29:45.260 --> 00:29:47.600]   of living solely for Christ yet,
[00:29:47.600 --> 00:29:50.380]   but by God's grace, he continued to work through me
[00:29:50.380 --> 00:29:51.480]   and shape my heart.
[00:29:51.480 --> 00:29:55.240]   Despite coming to this revelation once prior,
[00:29:55.240 --> 00:29:57.740]   fast forward to winter quarter of 2022,
[00:29:57.740 --> 00:30:00.160]   where I was still apathetic towards my schoolwork
[00:30:00.160 --> 00:30:02.880]   and unfortunately, the word.
[00:30:02.880 --> 00:30:06.120]   All of my attempts to feel better were futile.
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:09.340]   I failed to find permanent fulfillment in my relationships
[00:30:09.340 --> 00:30:13.220]   and even forced devotions completed for my own sake
[00:30:13.220 --> 00:30:16.020]   could never quench my thirst for something more.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:18.100]   And that is until God revealed to me
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:19.820]   the true purpose of life,
[00:30:19.820 --> 00:30:23.060]   that we as his creation are created
[00:30:23.060 --> 00:30:25.580]   for the worship of our creator.
[00:30:25.580 --> 00:30:28.540]   I can't even say that I came to this realization myself,
[00:30:28.540 --> 00:30:32.240]   that it was a concept my brain evolved to fully understand
[00:30:32.240 --> 00:30:34.860]   because that phrase had been present in my life
[00:30:34.860 --> 00:30:36.940]   for the last 13 years.
[00:30:36.940 --> 00:30:38.920]   And there is no other explanation
[00:30:38.920 --> 00:30:42.300]   other than the fact that God's hand was in this.
[00:30:42.300 --> 00:30:46.720]   His love is absolutely unfathomable and life-changing.
[00:30:46.720 --> 00:30:49.700]   How foolish of me to live my life for me
[00:30:49.700 --> 00:30:51.700]   when it is not even my own,
[00:30:51.700 --> 00:30:53.940]   purchased with the blood of Christ.
[00:30:53.940 --> 00:30:55.540]   Even just offering my life
[00:30:55.540 --> 00:30:58.140]   could never come close to his sacrifice for me.
[00:30:58.140 --> 00:30:59.500]   And to make matters worse,
[00:30:59.500 --> 00:31:01.600]   I never would have come to this realization
[00:31:01.600 --> 00:31:05.140]   had it been for God reaching out to me first.
[00:31:05.140 --> 00:31:07.200]   One of my favorite worship songs says,
[00:31:07.200 --> 00:31:09.320]   "And if you had not loved me first,
[00:31:09.320 --> 00:31:11.480]   "I would refuse you still."
[00:31:11.480 --> 00:31:14.200]   And it's crazy to me that such an amazing God
[00:31:14.200 --> 00:31:17.320]   cannot receive the little praise we humans have to offer
[00:31:17.320 --> 00:31:20.420]   without intervening and raising us to life first.
[00:31:20.420 --> 00:31:23.400]   The human language is so inadequate
[00:31:23.400 --> 00:31:25.820]   in describing this God we serve.
[00:31:25.820 --> 00:31:28.480]   Holy, a short two-syllable word
[00:31:28.480 --> 00:31:30.860]   tasked with conveying infinite glory,
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.440]   and I serve this transcendentally separate God.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:39.880]   I'm not here for a good life full of things that I deserve.
[00:31:39.880 --> 00:31:41.520]   My life is not my own,
[00:31:41.520 --> 00:31:43.320]   as the God who brought me out of death
[00:31:43.320 --> 00:31:45.260]   calls me to walk beside him,
[00:31:45.260 --> 00:31:47.660]   surrendered to his will for his glory.
[00:31:47.660 --> 00:31:50.520]   I love the way John Wesley puts it.
[00:31:50.520 --> 00:31:53.960]   He says, "Let it be the one business of my life
[00:31:53.960 --> 00:31:56.900]   "to glorify thee by every word of my tongue,
[00:31:56.900 --> 00:31:58.480]   "by every work of my hand,
[00:31:58.580 --> 00:32:01.900]   "by professing thy truth and by engaging all men,
[00:32:01.900 --> 00:32:05.620]   "so far as in me lies to glorify and love thee."
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:07.460]   I've always heard that being saved
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:09.420]   doesn't guarantee a painless life on Earth,
[00:32:09.420 --> 00:32:12.100]   and after a few recent events in my own life,
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.260]   I see how the opposite is true,
[00:32:14.260 --> 00:32:16.740]   the natural consequences of being consecrated
[00:32:16.740 --> 00:32:18.620]   in a broken world.
[00:32:18.620 --> 00:32:21.220]   Yet I remember God's providence as my redeemer
[00:32:21.220 --> 00:32:24.360]   and my defender from whom my help comes,
[00:32:24.360 --> 00:32:27.580]   and I remain steadfast with an otherworldly hope.
[00:32:27.580 --> 00:32:31.720]   And now my goal in life isn't my own glory or success,
[00:32:31.720 --> 00:32:34.780]   but just as it says in Romans 11, 36,
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:38.700]   "For from him and through him and to him are all things.
[00:32:38.700 --> 00:32:41.040]   "To him be the glory forever."
[00:32:41.040 --> 00:32:41.880]   Amen.
[00:32:41.880 --> 00:32:42.720]   Thank you.
[00:32:42.720 --> 00:32:45.880]   (audience applauding)
[00:32:45.880 --> 00:32:46.720]   Abram.
[00:32:46.720 --> 00:33:09.960]   (man speaking faintly)
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:13.200]   (man speaking faintly)

[00:33:38.960 --> 00:33:48.440]   - Thank you so much for your testimony.
[00:33:48.440 --> 00:33:53.760]   With each baptism, isn't it sweet to hear and fellowship,
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:58.760]   because basically every one of our stories is like that.
[00:33:58.760 --> 00:34:00.680]   If you didn't reach out to me, Lord,
[00:34:00.680 --> 00:34:03.680]   I would've just been lost in my sin.
[00:34:03.680 --> 00:34:08.560]   You initiated, you loved first, and how can I thank you?
[00:34:08.560 --> 00:34:11.240]   So it's great to be able to fellowship
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:13.360]   through her testimony in that way.
[00:34:13.360 --> 00:34:15.040]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:34:15.040 --> 00:34:17.800]   Go before the Lord, ask for his blessing upon our time.
[00:34:17.800 --> 00:34:25.240]   Heavenly Father, we truly thank you, God.
[00:34:25.240 --> 00:34:27.700]   We recognize, Lord, that the salvation that we have
[00:34:27.700 --> 00:34:30.520]   is not something we drew up and planned
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:33.600]   and then asked you to do for us.
[00:34:33.600 --> 00:34:36.400]   God, you have long ago from your own wisdom,
[00:34:36.400 --> 00:34:38.880]   from your own good intention,
[00:34:38.880 --> 00:34:41.360]   you have desired, Father, to redeem.
[00:34:41.360 --> 00:34:43.120]   And God, we just thank you so much.
[00:34:43.120 --> 00:34:46.500]   How can we ever thank you enough?
[00:34:46.500 --> 00:34:48.240]   And we're so thankful for Dani
[00:34:48.240 --> 00:34:50.800]   and pray that you will bless her in her faith
[00:34:50.800 --> 00:34:52.560]   and grow her, Lord, to all maturity
[00:34:52.560 --> 00:34:54.280]   that she will be a woman of God.
[00:34:54.280 --> 00:34:57.640]   We thank you now for your word that continues to lead us
[00:34:57.640 --> 00:34:59.920]   and teach us and sanctify us.
[00:34:59.920 --> 00:35:03.200]   We pray, God, that it would have its effect upon us.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:04.840]   We also this morning lift up a prayer
[00:35:04.840 --> 00:35:07.520]   for Pastor Peter Kim and the people
[00:35:07.520 --> 00:35:09.480]   who are ministering out in India.
[00:35:09.480 --> 00:35:14.300]   As they serve you, as they minister to the lost people there,
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.500]   would you empower them, grant them great boldness,
[00:35:17.500 --> 00:35:20.360]   entrust them continually with your message,
[00:35:20.360 --> 00:35:22.000]   and cause them, Lord, to be fruitful
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:23.360]   according to your own time.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:25.620]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name, amen.
[00:35:25.620 --> 00:35:30.160]   So just as I mentioned in the prayer,
[00:35:30.160 --> 00:35:32.800]   Pastor Peter Kim is this week out in India
[00:35:32.800 --> 00:35:35.040]   and he put up a message that I wanted to share
[00:35:35.040 --> 00:35:37.400]   that thankfully his travels there,
[00:35:37.400 --> 00:35:38.940]   'cause sometimes it can be a little tricky
[00:35:38.940 --> 00:35:41.820]   with all the different regulations
[00:35:41.820 --> 00:35:43.880]   and measures that are going on now,
[00:35:43.880 --> 00:35:45.480]   but he was able to land safely,
[00:35:45.480 --> 00:35:48.040]   meet the pastors there at the hotel,
[00:35:48.040 --> 00:35:49.440]   they're able to fellowship, to connect,
[00:35:49.440 --> 00:35:50.960]   so we're really grateful for that.
[00:35:50.960 --> 00:35:53.000]   And I'm continuing to pray for good travels
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.560]   as he moves from one city to the next
[00:35:54.560 --> 00:35:56.960]   and eventually will go through a complicated process
[00:35:56.960 --> 00:36:01.040]   to even come out, so we wanna continue to pray for that.
[00:36:01.040 --> 00:36:04.720]   This morning, please turn your Bibles to Mark chapter six,
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.360]   verses seven through 13,
[00:36:07.360 --> 00:36:10.000]   and then we're gonna also just touch upon,
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:11.920]   for reference, verse 32,
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:19.440]   but I'll read for us now from verse seven through 13.
[00:36:19.440 --> 00:36:22.720]   And the word of God says,
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:25.600]   "He summoned the 12 and began to send them out in pairs
[00:36:25.600 --> 00:36:29.380]   "and gave them authorities over the unclean spirits,
[00:36:29.380 --> 00:36:32.060]   "and he instructed them that they should take nothing
[00:36:32.060 --> 00:36:34.720]   "for their journey except a mere staff,
[00:36:34.720 --> 00:36:38.040]   "no bread, no bag, no money in their belt,
[00:36:38.040 --> 00:36:39.780]   "but to wear sandals, and he added,
[00:36:39.780 --> 00:36:41.980]   "do not put on two tunics.
[00:36:41.980 --> 00:36:44.460]   "And he said to them, wherever you enter a house,
[00:36:44.460 --> 00:36:46.660]   "stay there until you leave town.
[00:36:46.660 --> 00:36:49.360]   "Any place that does not receive you or listen to you
[00:36:49.360 --> 00:36:50.540]   "as you go out from there,
[00:36:50.540 --> 00:36:54.440]   "shake the dust off the soles of your feet
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:56.840]   "for a testimony against them.
[00:36:56.840 --> 00:36:59.340]   "They went out and preached that men should repent,
[00:36:59.340 --> 00:37:01.080]   "and they were casting out many demons
[00:37:01.080 --> 00:37:03.400]   "and were anointing with oil many sick people
[00:37:03.400 --> 00:37:04.600]   "and healing them."
[00:37:04.600 --> 00:37:07.760]   And if you draw your eyes to verse 30,
[00:37:07.760 --> 00:37:10.040]   it says, "The apostles gathered together with Jesus
[00:37:10.040 --> 00:37:13.240]   "and they reported to him all that they had done and taught.
[00:37:13.240 --> 00:37:14.200]   "And when he said to them,
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:17.280]   "come away by yourselves to a secluded place
[00:37:17.280 --> 00:37:18.720]   "and rest a while,
[00:37:18.720 --> 00:37:21.120]   "for there were many people coming and going,
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.300]   "and they did not even have time to eat.
[00:37:23.300 --> 00:37:24.720]   "They went away in the boat
[00:37:24.760 --> 00:37:27.880]   "to a secluded place by themselves."
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:30.720]   So as we take a look at this passage,
[00:37:30.720 --> 00:37:33.500]   we are jumping into a unique scenario,
[00:37:33.500 --> 00:37:37.960]   not fully halfway into the gospel context,
[00:37:37.960 --> 00:37:41.320]   but halfway into Jesus's earthly ministry.
[00:37:41.320 --> 00:37:43.160]   We come into a unique scenario
[00:37:43.160 --> 00:37:46.140]   where essentially Jesus, in his mode of ministry,
[00:37:46.140 --> 00:37:48.260]   there's a big change, okay?
[00:37:48.260 --> 00:37:50.760]   So I want to give you a little bit of context
[00:37:50.760 --> 00:37:52.420]   and we'll give a little bit more
[00:37:52.420 --> 00:37:53.520]   that if you think about it,
[00:37:53.520 --> 00:37:56.800]   Jesus was teaching and going from city to city
[00:37:56.800 --> 00:37:59.920]   and everybody had to come to him for that teaching.
[00:37:59.920 --> 00:38:03.640]   For the first pretty much two years of the ministry,
[00:38:03.640 --> 00:38:05.440]   Jesus was the one healing,
[00:38:05.440 --> 00:38:08.200]   he was the one giving the message of the kingdom.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:10.240]   And if you wanted to participate in that
[00:38:10.240 --> 00:38:11.680]   and you wanted to be healed,
[00:38:11.680 --> 00:38:13.720]   you would have to travel and go to where he was,
[00:38:13.720 --> 00:38:15.180]   in the city, right?
[00:38:15.180 --> 00:38:17.040]   Whichever city he may be.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:19.340]   But as you see now, within this context,
[00:38:19.340 --> 00:38:21.920]   Jesus is summoning the 12
[00:38:21.920 --> 00:38:24.320]   and beginning to give to them the message,
[00:38:24.320 --> 00:38:26.720]   give to them the authority, the power,
[00:38:26.720 --> 00:38:31.880]   and the instruction of how to do it,
[00:38:31.880 --> 00:38:34.120]   according to his way.
[00:38:34.120 --> 00:38:35.200]   So as we think about that,
[00:38:35.200 --> 00:38:37.720]   I want us to kind of think about an interesting scenario
[00:38:37.720 --> 00:38:41.240]   where maybe you're applying for a job
[00:38:41.240 --> 00:38:43.140]   and you put in the application
[00:38:43.140 --> 00:38:44.280]   and you did the best you can
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:47.320]   to make your resume look so good.
[00:38:47.320 --> 00:38:48.780]   You put in everything, right?
[00:38:48.780 --> 00:38:50.140]   Boom, boom, boom, boom, boom.
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:54.660]   Because this was a incredibly unique position
[00:38:54.660 --> 00:38:56.160]   that you applied for.
[00:38:56.160 --> 00:38:57.000]   The reason why I say this,
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:39:00.040]   because in Coral Area, if you think about their scenario,
[00:39:00.040 --> 00:39:04.080]   there were thousands of people who would follow Jesus, right?
[00:39:04.080 --> 00:39:06.720]   Now, not all of them were fully convinced,
[00:39:06.720 --> 00:39:09.660]   but there were actually many people who said to Jesus,
[00:39:09.660 --> 00:39:13.000]   "You're clearly a significant rabbi and teacher,
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:15.100]   "so let me follow you," right?
[00:39:15.100 --> 00:39:17.000]   There were many people like that.
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:19.340]   So you kind of start imagining
[00:39:19.340 --> 00:39:21.120]   how many people would follow Jesus,
[00:39:21.120 --> 00:39:23.840]   and of those many, many people who followed Jesus,
[00:39:23.840 --> 00:39:27.740]   Jesus only selected 12, right?
[00:39:27.740 --> 00:39:28.640]   If you think about it, then,
[00:39:28.640 --> 00:39:31.880]   that is some elite-level status
[00:39:31.880 --> 00:39:34.600]   of being able to serve in the company.
[00:39:34.600 --> 00:39:37.000]   So I want you to think about this.
[00:39:37.000 --> 00:39:38.740]   You apply for this position,
[00:39:38.740 --> 00:39:41.080]   you put in your resume all that you've done,
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:43.340]   all that you can do, and your skillset.
[00:39:43.340 --> 00:39:45.800]   Maybe in the throw in there, I speak some Spanish,
[00:39:45.800 --> 00:39:47.440]   even though you kind of don't.
[00:39:47.440 --> 00:39:48.880]   Whatever it may be, you can stick in there,
[00:39:48.880 --> 00:39:51.900]   you did, and then, lo and behold, you're chosen, right?
[00:39:51.900 --> 00:39:56.600]   But, whereas in our day, you get to negotiate some terms,
[00:39:56.600 --> 00:39:58.500]   and you ask some questions.
[00:39:58.500 --> 00:40:01.680]   So what are the expectations of the job?
[00:40:01.680 --> 00:40:03.580]   And in our day, when you think about
[00:40:03.580 --> 00:40:05.540]   people negotiating their positions,
[00:40:05.540 --> 00:40:07.800]   you will sometimes even negotiate,
[00:40:07.800 --> 00:40:09.340]   of course you'll negotiate benefits,
[00:40:09.340 --> 00:40:11.940]   but sometimes you'll negotiate who you work with.
[00:40:11.940 --> 00:40:15.060]   Will I be underneath somebody who's gonna train me?
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:17.300]   Will I have opportunity for the future?
[00:40:17.300 --> 00:40:18.900]   Sometimes you start negotiating,
[00:40:18.900 --> 00:40:22.180]   will you require me to travel much, right?
[00:40:22.180 --> 00:40:24.580]   Is there going to be, and then the benefits for future,
[00:40:24.580 --> 00:40:25.960]   this kind of retirement plan,
[00:40:25.960 --> 00:40:28.940]   will I also maybe get some stock, like that kind of stuff?
[00:40:28.940 --> 00:40:30.740]   And that's all in the package,
[00:40:30.740 --> 00:40:33.380]   and good job hunting in our day would mean
[00:40:33.380 --> 00:40:36.860]   that you actually take the prerogative that you have
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:39.700]   to negotiate the best case scenario for yourself.
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:41.020]   That's good earthly wisdom,
[00:40:41.020 --> 00:40:44.940]   so more power to you if you're skilled in it.
[00:40:44.940 --> 00:40:46.420]   But imagine this scenario.
[00:40:47.300 --> 00:40:50.780]   Jesus selects you, and you say something like,
[00:40:50.780 --> 00:40:53.460]   will we be able to negotiate some expectations here
[00:40:53.460 --> 00:40:55.140]   of will we travel much?
[00:40:55.140 --> 00:40:56.460]   And he goes, all the time.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:41:00.060]   That's all you're gonna be doing, actually.
[00:41:00.060 --> 00:41:05.980]   Can I start a little later after I set up my previous work
[00:41:05.980 --> 00:41:07.140]   and sort everything out?
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:07.980]   And he says, no.
[00:41:07.980 --> 00:41:10.980]   No.
[00:41:10.980 --> 00:41:12.900]   If you recall, there's a passage for you
[00:41:12.900 --> 00:41:15.700]   on Luke chapter nine, verse 59.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:19.100]   He told people, follow me, and they were willing,
[00:41:19.100 --> 00:41:20.760]   but then some of them said,
[00:41:20.760 --> 00:41:23.260]   Lord, permit me first to go bury my father.
[00:41:23.260 --> 00:41:27.460]   And he said some really hard words.
[00:41:27.460 --> 00:41:31.360]   No, let the dead bury their own.
[00:41:31.360 --> 00:41:32.200]   And somebody asked,
[00:41:32.200 --> 00:41:34.600]   can I please tend to the matters in my home?
[00:41:34.600 --> 00:41:36.660]   Can I make sure everything is okay?
[00:41:36.660 --> 00:41:40.260]   That's a responsible thing to do, to at least say goodbye.
[00:41:40.260 --> 00:41:44.080]   And he said, no, you come now.
[00:41:44.080 --> 00:41:45.840]   Can you imagine that kind of negotiation
[00:41:45.840 --> 00:41:48.120]   if you're applying for a job?
[00:41:48.120 --> 00:41:51.300]   You start asking, who am I gonna go with?
[00:41:51.300 --> 00:41:54.680]   What's gonna be the expectation here?
[00:41:54.680 --> 00:41:57.600]   Is there gonna be a scenario where I get to,
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.160]   not necessarily spread my wings,
[00:41:59.160 --> 00:42:00.800]   but at least develop my skills
[00:42:00.800 --> 00:42:02.180]   and use them to the max ability?
[00:42:02.180 --> 00:42:05.820]   And he tells you, most people will probably
[00:42:05.820 --> 00:42:08.440]   not really believe.
[00:42:08.440 --> 00:42:10.800]   You won't actually make that sale.
[00:42:10.800 --> 00:42:13.600]   Are you willing to sign on?
[00:42:14.280 --> 00:42:15.680]   And the reason why I ask this question
[00:42:15.680 --> 00:42:17.280]   is because within this passage,
[00:42:17.280 --> 00:42:19.380]   it's talking about evangelism.
[00:42:19.380 --> 00:42:21.960]   It's talking about the training up of the disciples.
[00:42:21.960 --> 00:42:25.160]   It's talking about the first mission trip
[00:42:25.160 --> 00:42:27.560]   of those who are selected by Christ
[00:42:27.560 --> 00:42:29.460]   to train them for the ministry.
[00:42:29.460 --> 00:42:33.320]   But there is a lot to learn and ask
[00:42:33.320 --> 00:42:36.160]   about how willing are we to do all of that?
[00:42:36.160 --> 00:42:40.240]   It's a primary question of to what degree
[00:42:40.240 --> 00:42:41.880]   are we willing to follow?
[00:42:43.520 --> 00:42:46.400]   And I ask that because within all of the difficulties
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:48.640]   that the disciples will go through,
[00:42:48.640 --> 00:42:50.440]   that the apostles will go through,
[00:42:50.440 --> 00:42:52.880]   it gives us this challenge.
[00:42:52.880 --> 00:42:54.760]   To what extent and what degree
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:57.440]   will we be willing to just take it?
[00:42:57.440 --> 00:42:58.840]   And that's why I've entitled the sermon,
[00:42:58.840 --> 00:43:00.600]   "Take it or Leave it."
[00:43:00.600 --> 00:43:02.880]   It sounds a little harsh.
[00:43:02.880 --> 00:43:05.840]   It sounds a little like bad attitude.
[00:43:05.840 --> 00:43:09.120]   But there's an element to a challenge to us
[00:43:09.120 --> 00:43:12.020]   to ask how willing are we?
[00:43:12.020 --> 00:43:14.620]   Or do we expect that we can negotiate
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.700]   the terms of discipleship?
[00:43:16.700 --> 00:43:18.540]   That we can negotiate where we go,
[00:43:18.540 --> 00:43:20.960]   when we go, how we go, and more?
[00:43:20.960 --> 00:43:22.980]   And so setting the background a little bit more
[00:43:22.980 --> 00:43:25.600]   as a first step into the study of this passage,
[00:43:25.600 --> 00:43:29.800]   because again, we are jumping into a narrative.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:31.480]   This isn't like prescriptive,
[00:43:31.480 --> 00:43:34.480]   you go therefore and don't you make any money.
[00:43:34.480 --> 00:43:35.800]   This is not a prescriptive passage.
[00:43:35.800 --> 00:43:38.140]   It's a descriptive story in the gospel.
[00:43:38.140 --> 00:43:41.280]   And there's corollary passages both in Matthew 10
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.720]   and Luke chapter 10.
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:44.680]   And I was a little afraid because Pastor Peter
[00:43:44.680 --> 00:43:47.940]   is going to eventually preach this passage in Luke 10.
[00:43:47.940 --> 00:43:49.120]   But at the pace that he's going,
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:51.400]   I realized, oh, we're gonna probably forget
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:52.600]   everything that I've said by then.
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.380]   I have some safety and time.
[00:43:54.380 --> 00:43:57.980]   But when we think about this passage,
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:02.980]   what Jesus is doing is imagine if we had a summer retreat
[00:44:02.980 --> 00:44:07.320]   and Jesus selected 12 particular individuals
[00:44:07.320 --> 00:44:09.720]   and said, "I'm going to train you to go.
[00:44:09.720 --> 00:44:12.540]   "And when you go, I want you to for sure,
[00:44:12.540 --> 00:44:14.020]   "know the message.
[00:44:14.020 --> 00:44:16.460]   "You have to know what you preach,
[00:44:16.460 --> 00:44:19.480]   "but I'm gonna prepare and train you how to go.
[00:44:19.480 --> 00:44:21.180]   "And you're gonna go with nothing.
[00:44:21.180 --> 00:44:23.960]   "But amazingly, up until now,
[00:44:23.960 --> 00:44:26.280]   "although you have seen me do wonders and miracles,
[00:44:26.280 --> 00:44:29.680]   "I'm going to empower you with authority to do the same.
[00:44:29.680 --> 00:44:32.600]   "Even the authority to heal sickness,
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:36.440]   "and even the authority to raise the dead."
[00:44:36.440 --> 00:44:37.640]   That's incredible.
[00:44:38.800 --> 00:44:40.160]   And what I'm gonna challenge you with
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:42.980]   is there are some implications for us to take home,
[00:44:42.980 --> 00:44:45.280]   and there are some principles for us to take home,
[00:44:45.280 --> 00:44:47.480]   but I wanna just give you the challenge now
[00:44:47.480 --> 00:44:50.240]   that just remember that even though some of the things
[00:44:50.240 --> 00:44:53.080]   that are expected of the disciples are extreme,
[00:44:53.080 --> 00:44:57.680]   every single one of us actually has an expectation
[00:44:57.680 --> 00:45:00.720]   placed upon us to serve the kingdom of God, amen?
[00:45:00.720 --> 00:45:03.840]   Jesus did not just simply tell us,
[00:45:03.840 --> 00:45:06.640]   "Come to me all who are heavy laden,"
[00:45:06.640 --> 00:45:10.120]   and then stop there to say, "Good, I'm glad you came.
[00:45:10.120 --> 00:45:12.680]   "Stay as long as you want."
[00:45:12.680 --> 00:45:14.280]   Jesus has already told us,
[00:45:14.280 --> 00:45:16.600]   "I have prepared you for good works.
[00:45:16.600 --> 00:45:18.560]   "I have designed you to be a light,
[00:45:18.560 --> 00:45:22.840]   "and you will eventually have to carry this gospel."
[00:45:22.840 --> 00:45:25.240]   Not every single one of us has to be a missionary.
[00:45:25.240 --> 00:45:26.520]   And if you are a member here,
[00:45:26.520 --> 00:45:27.840]   you know that I've sat you down
[00:45:27.840 --> 00:45:29.680]   in our membership process and told you
[00:45:29.680 --> 00:45:32.880]   we believe the church is unified by one gospel,
[00:45:32.880 --> 00:45:35.280]   one baptism, one truth, one spirit,
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:37.040]   and so we're all alike.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:39.320]   However, we're not all the same.
[00:45:39.320 --> 00:45:43.440]   First Corinthians 12 tells us that there's variety.
[00:45:43.440 --> 00:45:46.320]   We are one but many, and not every single one of you
[00:45:46.320 --> 00:45:48.560]   should be serving in the children's ministry.
[00:45:48.560 --> 00:45:50.440]   There are those of you who are so good
[00:45:50.440 --> 00:45:52.760]   the kids feel so comfortable around you.
[00:45:52.760 --> 00:45:56.880]   Others, you know, this is awkward, right?
[00:45:56.880 --> 00:45:58.320]   Others of you are designed
[00:45:58.320 --> 00:45:59.880]   where you're so warm and welcoming,
[00:45:59.880 --> 00:46:01.120]   you should be on the welcome team,
[00:46:01.120 --> 00:46:03.620]   and others of you may not be so, right?
[00:46:04.880 --> 00:46:08.120]   However, every single one of us has signed off to say,
[00:46:08.120 --> 00:46:11.040]   "But I am a carrier of the gospel."
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:13.600]   Our design is that whether you,
[00:46:13.600 --> 00:46:16.880]   doesn't matter whether you're one who preaches to 100,
[00:46:16.880 --> 00:46:19.640]   but God will uniquely design you to place you
[00:46:19.640 --> 00:46:22.160]   wherever you are in your home, in your workplace,
[00:46:22.160 --> 00:46:25.280]   in your classroom, to be the vessel
[00:46:25.280 --> 00:46:27.720]   in which Christ has put his love,
[00:46:27.720 --> 00:46:30.960]   his spirit, and his truth, amen?
[00:46:30.960 --> 00:46:32.640]   None of you can say,
[00:46:32.640 --> 00:46:37.200]   "Ministry where we go and share the gospel is not for me."
[00:46:37.200 --> 00:46:38.200]   You can't say that.
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:41.680]   You can't say, "I am not a light."
[00:46:41.680 --> 00:46:45.920]   Jesus has told you that you cannot hide in the pews
[00:46:45.920 --> 00:46:49.580]   because you were not designed as a candle of God
[00:46:49.580 --> 00:46:51.760]   to be hidden in the pews.
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:52.940]   Just like none of us can say,
[00:46:52.940 --> 00:46:56.840]   "Prayer, not so much for me," right?
[00:46:56.840 --> 00:46:59.960]   "I am the worker bee, but prayer people are others."
[00:46:59.960 --> 00:47:01.280]   No, no, no.
[00:47:01.280 --> 00:47:03.360]   Every single one of us have been designed
[00:47:03.360 --> 00:47:05.800]   to do various aspects of ministry.
[00:47:05.800 --> 00:47:07.700]   Praying for the lost, being the light,
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:11.600]   and sharing the gospel is for us all, amen?
[00:47:11.600 --> 00:47:13.440]   And that means as the design of the church,
[00:47:13.440 --> 00:47:15.680]   you know, scripture has said,
[00:47:15.680 --> 00:47:17.960]   every single one of us are gonna play a part,
[00:47:17.960 --> 00:47:20.740]   and God has designed us to do the work of ministry,
[00:47:20.740 --> 00:47:22.400]   these things apply.
[00:47:22.400 --> 00:47:26.280]   And so as a just exhortation and reminder to us,
[00:47:26.280 --> 00:47:29.480]   we don't expect everyone to serve in the exact same way,
[00:47:29.480 --> 00:47:34.200]   but you are a part of the redemptive ministry of God.
[00:47:34.200 --> 00:47:36.400]   And therefore, we need to take home these points.
[00:47:36.400 --> 00:47:39.920]   The first one being, it's kind of long, I apologize.
[00:47:39.920 --> 00:47:42.680]   Principle number one,
[00:47:42.680 --> 00:47:46.760]   please be careful not to question God's wisdom.
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:50.460]   Please be careful not to interject your own great ideas,
[00:47:50.460 --> 00:47:52.100]   but instead be willing to take on
[00:47:52.100 --> 00:47:54.520]   the entire ministry as it is.
[00:47:55.980 --> 00:48:00.520]   In summary, be willing to take the entire sum of ministry
[00:48:00.520 --> 00:48:01.800]   as it comes to you.
[00:48:01.800 --> 00:48:05.640]   Just take it as a whole shebang.
[00:48:05.640 --> 00:48:06.780]   And the reason why I'm saying this
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:09.760]   is not because good ideas are actually bad.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:12.500]   Some of you are very gifted in administration,
[00:48:12.500 --> 00:48:14.300]   and so you like to ask detailed questions.
[00:48:14.300 --> 00:48:15.820]   Wait a minute, how is this gonna work?
[00:48:15.820 --> 00:48:17.580]   Wait a minute, who's gonna take care of this part?
[00:48:17.580 --> 00:48:18.420]   And wait a minute,
[00:48:18.420 --> 00:48:21.300]   this part we haven't really thought through, good.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:23.200]   Employ your gifts for the health
[00:48:23.200 --> 00:48:24.900]   and edification of the church.
[00:48:24.900 --> 00:48:26.440]   You understand me, right?
[00:48:26.440 --> 00:48:28.800]   The kind of don't interject your ideas
[00:48:28.800 --> 00:48:30.060]   that I'm talking about,
[00:48:30.060 --> 00:48:33.140]   and the kind of just take it that I'm talking about
[00:48:33.140 --> 00:48:36.060]   is because when it comes to ministry,
[00:48:36.060 --> 00:48:38.400]   there are many moments where we ourselves,
[00:48:38.400 --> 00:48:41.620]   in our mind and our eyes, what we see,
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:44.860]   we are gonna say, that doesn't look like it's going to work.
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.300]   Take a moment to let that sink in.
[00:48:49.300 --> 00:48:51.780]   When you do ministry, have there been times
[00:48:51.780 --> 00:48:54.560]   when your mind, because you saw some things,
[00:48:54.560 --> 00:48:57.700]   said, that's not going to work.
[00:48:57.700 --> 00:48:59.660]   And because we're so good at calculating
[00:48:59.660 --> 00:49:02.420]   and predicting and projecting,
[00:49:02.420 --> 00:49:04.600]   we have said, Lord, I don't know
[00:49:04.600 --> 00:49:07.420]   if your ministry model is going to work.
[00:49:07.420 --> 00:49:12.100]   I want you to take a moment now to think with me
[00:49:12.100 --> 00:49:13.940]   and imagine with me.
[00:49:13.940 --> 00:49:17.380]   You have to place yourself in the scenario of the gospels,
[00:49:17.380 --> 00:49:20.780]   and of the gospels, it wasn't like today,
[00:49:20.780 --> 00:49:22.820]   but when there was a commotion,
[00:49:22.820 --> 00:49:25.600]   people of the town came together.
[00:49:25.600 --> 00:49:29.680]   I mean, people of the entire town came together.
[00:49:29.680 --> 00:49:31.160]   Right now, we're so disjointed.
[00:49:31.160 --> 00:49:33.800]   If stuff happens, yes, we see it on Facebook,
[00:49:33.800 --> 00:49:35.280]   we see it on Instagram,
[00:49:35.280 --> 00:49:37.640]   but back then, everyone would show up and just stay.
[00:49:37.640 --> 00:49:40.080]   So if you recall, when there was healing going on,
[00:49:40.080 --> 00:49:42.200]   they stayed through lunch and dinner,
[00:49:42.200 --> 00:49:43.960]   and they said, how are we gonna eat?
[00:49:43.960 --> 00:49:47.520]   And the reason why I'm asking you to think about that
[00:49:47.520 --> 00:49:50.160]   is because just like the disciples would wonder,
[00:49:50.160 --> 00:49:52.800]   what are we gonna do with all these people?
[00:49:52.800 --> 00:49:55.360]   There were thousands of people sometimes.
[00:49:55.360 --> 00:49:58.160]   Just in the miracle of feeding the 5,000,
[00:49:58.160 --> 00:50:00.380]   you guys have heard that that only counts the men.
[00:50:00.380 --> 00:50:02.280]   That means easily could have been double that,
[00:50:02.280 --> 00:50:05.000]   very easily double, 10,000 people.
[00:50:05.000 --> 00:50:08.720]   If you saw Jesus now all of a sudden say,
[00:50:08.720 --> 00:50:11.740]   we need to delegate the responsibility to the ministry,
[00:50:11.740 --> 00:50:14.580]   so I pick 12, you know what I would have done?
[00:50:14.580 --> 00:50:15.760]   As an administrator,
[00:50:15.760 --> 00:50:17.560]   I'm the administrative pastor at the church,
[00:50:17.560 --> 00:50:21.320]   I would have just, how about some more?
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:23.440]   You know, like 12 is not enough.
[00:50:23.440 --> 00:50:25.240]   This isn't gonna work.
[00:50:25.240 --> 00:50:26.960]   This ratio is all off.
[00:50:26.960 --> 00:50:29.880]   You're talking about 5,000 people, 1,000 people,
[00:50:29.880 --> 00:50:31.760]   you're talking about villages,
[00:50:31.760 --> 00:50:33.120]   and then you put us into pockets,
[00:50:33.120 --> 00:50:35.800]   so actually there's only six crews, right?
[00:50:35.800 --> 00:50:37.020]   Two by two, so.
[00:50:37.020 --> 00:50:39.620]   Do you see what I'm saying?
[00:50:39.620 --> 00:50:41.240]   Your immediate projection would have been,
[00:50:41.240 --> 00:50:42.400]   this doesn't work.
[00:50:42.400 --> 00:50:45.320]   Sometimes Jesus says things, and in my silly mind,
[00:50:45.320 --> 00:50:47.080]   I sometimes read the Bible in a silly way
[00:50:47.080 --> 00:50:49.160]   where I put myself in their shoes,
[00:50:49.160 --> 00:50:50.480]   and I have weird thoughts.
[00:50:50.480 --> 00:50:52.640]   So I'm gonna take you down some of those things.
[00:50:52.640 --> 00:50:54.360]   You know when Jesus told the Pharisees,
[00:50:54.360 --> 00:50:55.200]   the Pharisees were like,
[00:50:55.200 --> 00:50:57.080]   what are these people doing worshiping you?
[00:50:57.080 --> 00:51:00.080]   And then Jesus was like, if you force them to stop,
[00:51:00.080 --> 00:51:02.360]   even the rocks will cry out.
[00:51:02.360 --> 00:51:03.920]   I remember reading and being like,
[00:51:03.920 --> 00:51:05.120]   I would like to see that.
[00:51:05.120 --> 00:51:06.680]   (laughs)
[00:51:06.680 --> 00:51:09.040]   That would be amazing stuff
[00:51:09.040 --> 00:51:12.080]   if we saw when everyone was gathered in Jerusalem,
[00:51:12.080 --> 00:51:14.160]   there was over a million people just,
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:17.720]   wah, like worship, palm branches, and the rocks.
[00:51:17.720 --> 00:51:19.040]   Boom, right?
[00:51:19.040 --> 00:51:20.580]   This is the Lord.
[00:51:20.580 --> 00:51:23.040]   Hail the one who comes in the name of the Lord,
[00:51:23.040 --> 00:51:24.880]   son of David, right?
[00:51:24.880 --> 00:51:26.640]   Like, can you imagine disciples saying,
[00:51:26.640 --> 00:51:28.240]   like, wait a minute,
[00:51:28.240 --> 00:51:31.800]   if you're already doing miracles and wonders,
[00:51:31.800 --> 00:51:35.520]   why not just make the rocks cry out?
[00:51:35.520 --> 00:51:36.360]   Right?
[00:51:36.360 --> 00:51:40.040]   And then if you were one of those very self-conscious people
[00:51:40.040 --> 00:51:42.040]   which I think some of the disciples were,
[00:51:42.040 --> 00:51:44.520]   there was the doubting Thomas, right?
[00:51:44.520 --> 00:51:47.820]   He would always ask, like, wait, I don't see it, you know?
[00:51:47.820 --> 00:51:51.320]   Then you would wonder, like, literally one year ago,
[00:51:51.320 --> 00:51:55.260]   I did not deal with people, I just dealt with numbers, right?
[00:51:55.260 --> 00:51:57.200]   I'm a tax guy, I don't do this stuff.
[00:51:57.200 --> 00:52:00.560]   Can you imagine people operating by their own sight,
[00:52:00.560 --> 00:52:04.640]   determining for the Lord Jesus, this is not going to work?
[00:52:04.640 --> 00:52:08.040]   Question, does this happen in our day?
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:11.440]   Question, does this happen for you?
[00:52:11.440 --> 00:52:14.480]   Sometimes it happens on large-scale levels
[00:52:14.480 --> 00:52:16.760]   where swaths of mainstream Christianity,
[00:52:16.760 --> 00:52:18.320]   I feel like I've said, oh, you know what?
[00:52:18.320 --> 00:52:20.560]   That preaching repentance stuff,
[00:52:20.560 --> 00:52:23.560]   that core hard message, that's not gonna work.
[00:52:23.560 --> 00:52:26.120]   This discipleship stuff, that's not gonna work.
[00:52:26.120 --> 00:52:28.560]   We need to first get them in here and da-da-da-da-da.
[00:52:28.560 --> 00:52:31.920]   Does it happen on a more private level?
[00:52:31.920 --> 00:52:34.320]   How many of times have we looked at somebody
[00:52:34.320 --> 00:52:35.680]   in our own family and it's like,
[00:52:35.680 --> 00:52:37.440]   that guy's never gonna turn.
[00:52:37.440 --> 00:52:39.160]   I've already talked about gospel with him,
[00:52:39.160 --> 00:52:40.360]   it's never gonna happen.
[00:52:40.360 --> 00:52:44.560]   We project so quickly.
[00:52:45.680 --> 00:52:47.900]   But Jesus' model is very simple.
[00:52:47.900 --> 00:52:51.120]   You come bearing the message of God.
[00:52:51.120 --> 00:52:55.320]   You call people to repentance by the power of God
[00:52:55.320 --> 00:52:59.000]   and you take nothing with you but your own faith
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:01.280]   and the model of your own godly life.
[00:53:01.280 --> 00:53:05.320]   And you bring with you the compassions of Christ
[00:53:05.320 --> 00:53:08.940]   and you do it, you heal people, you minister to people.
[00:53:08.940 --> 00:53:13.400]   The model of Jesus Christ was very, very simple, amen?
[00:53:13.400 --> 00:53:18.400]   But then why is it that we tell him it's not going to work
[00:53:18.400 --> 00:53:20.520]   and that's why I gave just a warning
[00:53:20.520 --> 00:53:25.440]   that we dare not act as though we know better the outcome.
[00:53:25.440 --> 00:53:28.560]   But it is unfortunate that if you think about it,
[00:53:28.560 --> 00:53:31.280]   what has been a hindrance to evangelistic ministry,
[00:53:31.280 --> 00:53:35.760]   even Christian counseling, even church ministry as a whole
[00:53:35.760 --> 00:53:38.200]   where pragmatic people may be well-intending
[00:53:38.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   who have said that's not going to work.
[00:53:40.200 --> 00:53:43.120]   That's sad to think about.
[00:53:43.120 --> 00:53:45.240]   But if you think about even other scenarios,
[00:53:45.240 --> 00:53:48.440]   Jesus did not tell you to do the things you need to do
[00:53:48.440 --> 00:53:50.880]   in your life just because it's going to work.
[00:53:50.880 --> 00:53:54.440]   I mean, think about the command to go reconcile
[00:53:54.440 --> 00:53:55.800]   with somebody you're at odds with
[00:53:55.800 --> 00:53:58.440]   before you come to worship, right?
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:01.400]   Does he promise you?
[00:54:01.400 --> 00:54:03.400]   Do it 'cause it's always going to work.
[00:54:03.400 --> 00:54:06.040]   When you go and reach that person who's bitter with you
[00:54:06.040 --> 00:54:08.880]   and you go over and say sorry, that's always going to work.
[00:54:08.880 --> 00:54:11.520]   Or if you're mad because someone sinned against you,
[00:54:11.520 --> 00:54:13.600]   that it's always going to work.
[00:54:13.600 --> 00:54:19.360]   No, he told you to do it because a lot of things.
[00:54:19.360 --> 00:54:21.360]   He's working on your heart
[00:54:21.360 --> 00:54:24.360]   because you can't come to worship clear conscience
[00:54:24.360 --> 00:54:27.200]   with strife, bitterness in your heart.
[00:54:27.200 --> 00:54:28.880]   He's working on the church,
[00:54:28.880 --> 00:54:31.760]   making sure the church is purified and whole.
[00:54:31.760 --> 00:54:34.760]   He's working on the testimony of God
[00:54:34.760 --> 00:54:37.600]   that by you doing that, there is the element of the gospel
[00:54:37.600 --> 00:54:39.080]   in your private relationships.
[00:54:39.080 --> 00:54:43.400]   He's doing so much more than just making it work for you.
[00:54:43.400 --> 00:54:46.560]   But to me, it's a radical, radical detriment
[00:54:46.560 --> 00:54:49.240]   to the Christian faith when I hear people say,
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:50.880]   that doesn't work for me.
[00:54:50.880 --> 00:54:55.360]   God is working on so much more
[00:54:55.360 --> 00:54:57.400]   than just making it work for you.
[00:54:57.400 --> 00:55:02.300]   And sometimes he's just leaving a testimony for himself.
[00:55:02.300 --> 00:55:05.120]   He's leaving just the testimony of his grace
[00:55:05.120 --> 00:55:07.840]   in every scenario that needs it.
[00:55:07.840 --> 00:55:12.060]   And that's why we must trust him and abide by his way.
[00:55:12.060 --> 00:55:14.280]   As a matter of fact, I wanna emphasize this point
[00:55:14.280 --> 00:55:18.420]   by looking over at Mark chapter six, verse one through six,
[00:55:18.420 --> 00:55:21.640]   just the passage before our passage.
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:23.520]   In Mark chapter six, verse one through six,
[00:55:23.520 --> 00:55:25.480]   Jesus is going from town to town,
[00:55:25.480 --> 00:55:27.920]   and the town that he lands on prior to this
[00:55:27.920 --> 00:55:30.140]   is his own hometown.
[00:55:30.140 --> 00:55:32.320]   It says he came to his own hometown of Nazareth,
[00:55:32.320 --> 00:55:33.600]   his disciples followed him.
[00:55:33.600 --> 00:55:35.480]   In verse two, when the Sabbath came,
[00:55:35.480 --> 00:55:37.720]   he began to teach in the synagogue,
[00:55:37.720 --> 00:55:40.600]   and the many listeners were astonished, saying,
[00:55:40.600 --> 00:55:42.760]   where did this man get these things,
[00:55:42.760 --> 00:55:45.880]   and what is his wisdom given to him?
[00:55:45.880 --> 00:55:49.440]   And such miracles as these performed by his hands.
[00:55:49.440 --> 00:55:51.960]   Wait a minute, is this, is not this the carpenter,
[00:55:51.960 --> 00:55:53.840]   the son of Mary, the brother of James,
[00:55:53.840 --> 00:55:57.280]   and Joseph, and Judas, and Simon?
[00:55:57.280 --> 00:55:58.720]   Are not his sisters here with us?
[00:55:58.720 --> 00:56:01.440]   And they took offense at him.
[00:56:01.440 --> 00:56:04.960]   Jesus said to them, a prophet is not without honor,
[00:56:04.960 --> 00:56:07.520]   except his own hometown, and among his own relatives,
[00:56:07.520 --> 00:56:09.200]   and in his own household.
[00:56:09.200 --> 00:56:11.720]   And he could do no miracle there,
[00:56:11.720 --> 00:56:14.000]   except that he laid his hands on a few sick people,
[00:56:14.000 --> 00:56:15.120]   and healed them.
[00:56:15.120 --> 00:56:17.400]   And he wondered at their unbelief,
[00:56:17.400 --> 00:56:19.160]   and he was going around the villages teaching.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:22.120]   So, I want you to think about this.
[00:56:22.120 --> 00:56:24.420]   When it comes to the idea of it doesn't work,
[00:56:24.420 --> 00:56:27.960]   I mean, we potentially can put ourselves
[00:56:27.960 --> 00:56:32.400]   in such an offensive, can you imagine us asking Jesus,
[00:56:32.400 --> 00:56:35.400]   what happened in your own hometown, right?
[00:56:35.400 --> 00:56:37.200]   How come your miracles didn't work?
[00:56:37.200 --> 00:56:39.920]   He literally said he could do no miracles,
[00:56:39.920 --> 00:56:43.320]   because of the absolute hardness of the ground there,
[00:56:43.320 --> 00:56:44.960]   hardness of the faith.
[00:56:44.960 --> 00:56:46.480]   And it would be so nonsensical,
[00:56:46.480 --> 00:56:48.000]   it would be just like Isaiah, right?
[00:56:48.000 --> 00:56:50.440]   Heeding the call, who will go for us?
[00:56:50.440 --> 00:56:53.340]   And Isaiah says, me, Lord, I'll go for you.
[00:56:53.340 --> 00:56:56.180]   And God says, you're gonna speak to a bunch of people
[00:56:56.180 --> 00:56:58.480]   who will keep on hearing, but not understand.
[00:56:58.480 --> 00:57:01.060]   And then as Isaiah goes, he goes,
[00:57:01.060 --> 00:57:03.360]   well, it gives, it's not working.
[00:57:03.360 --> 00:57:06.040]   You do realize, at certain moments,
[00:57:06.040 --> 00:57:10.300]   God is clearly judging people,
[00:57:10.300 --> 00:57:13.000]   and he is revealing the hardness
[00:57:13.000 --> 00:57:15.480]   of the hearts of men and their sin.
[00:57:15.480 --> 00:57:18.720]   And if we are part of that, we dare not complain,
[00:57:18.720 --> 00:57:20.520]   this is not what we want it to be.
[00:57:20.520 --> 00:57:24.880]   I have a wiser way for you to go about it.
[00:57:24.880 --> 00:57:26.300]   We dare not do that, amen?
[00:57:26.300 --> 00:57:29.060]   And so, the first exhortation for us,
[00:57:29.960 --> 00:57:32.820]   take, if you're ministering to some people
[00:57:32.820 --> 00:57:35.100]   who are hard to work with,
[00:57:35.100 --> 00:57:37.200]   remember, you're taking it all.
[00:57:37.200 --> 00:57:39.680]   You're willing to take the frustration,
[00:57:39.680 --> 00:57:41.460]   the need for your patience.
[00:57:41.460 --> 00:57:42.640]   If you're trying to evangelize
[00:57:42.640 --> 00:57:44.700]   to someone who seems impossible,
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.620]   you're willing to take it all, right?
[00:57:46.620 --> 00:57:48.780]   If you're trying to minister or do anything
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:50.820]   in the kingdom of God,
[00:57:50.820 --> 00:57:54.220]   remember, you take with it the whole shebang, yes?
[00:57:54.220 --> 00:57:58.140]   Number two, principle number two.
[00:57:58.140 --> 00:58:02.100]   Please be careful not to secure your own benefits.
[00:58:02.100 --> 00:58:04.260]   Instead, be willing to live dependently
[00:58:04.260 --> 00:58:06.140]   on God's daily provision.
[00:58:06.140 --> 00:58:10.620]   Not your own benefits,
[00:58:10.620 --> 00:58:14.260]   but dependence on God's daily provision.
[00:58:14.260 --> 00:58:16.900]   So be willing to be dependent, everyone.
[00:58:16.900 --> 00:58:19.380]   Be willing to be dependent on God.
[00:58:19.380 --> 00:58:22.040]   Take a look at the passage that we're looking at
[00:58:22.040 --> 00:58:23.360]   in verse eight and nine.
[00:58:23.360 --> 00:58:25.100]   So this is Mark 6, eight and nine.
[00:58:25.980 --> 00:58:28.540]   And it says, "He instructed them
[00:58:28.540 --> 00:58:30.940]   "that they should take nothing for their journey
[00:58:30.940 --> 00:58:33.660]   "except for a mere staff."
[00:58:33.660 --> 00:58:34.860]   Now, I want you to think about this.
[00:58:34.860 --> 00:58:36.180]   It's kind of like,
[00:58:36.180 --> 00:58:38.380]   remember how I told you I read passages
[00:58:38.380 --> 00:58:39.620]   and it's sometimes kind of silly
[00:58:39.620 --> 00:58:41.380]   and then I have to correct it?
[00:58:41.380 --> 00:58:43.140]   So the way I first read it was like,
[00:58:43.140 --> 00:58:45.860]   oh, this is kind of like, boom, boom, boom,
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:47.900]   on this episode of Survivor.
[00:58:47.900 --> 00:58:50.140]   And it's like, you take nothing with you,
[00:58:50.140 --> 00:58:52.740]   but this staff, can you survive?
[00:58:52.740 --> 00:58:56.660]   But that kind of model I don't think is correct.
[00:58:56.660 --> 00:58:58.100]   Because let me ask you,
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:02.360]   why is Jesus making sure that these individuals
[00:59:02.360 --> 00:59:03.380]   go out with nothing?
[00:59:03.380 --> 00:59:06.960]   Is it because Jesus was like, put on the face mask stuff
[00:59:06.960 --> 00:59:09.740]   and put on the, you know, the, I guess,
[00:59:09.740 --> 00:59:13.780]   elite military, Navy SEALs, Green Beret,
[00:59:13.780 --> 00:59:15.100]   that kind of mentality.
[00:59:15.100 --> 00:59:18.700]   And you survive out there with nothing.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:21.940]   And when you come back, you will be my soldiers.
[00:59:21.940 --> 00:59:23.580]   Is that what he said?
[00:59:23.580 --> 00:59:25.080]   I don't think so.
[00:59:25.080 --> 00:59:27.940]   So what I just shared with you now, cross that out.
[00:59:27.940 --> 00:59:31.460]   And if you thought like that, I don't think it's correct.
[00:59:31.460 --> 00:59:34.560]   He tells them no bread, no bag, no money,
[00:59:34.560 --> 00:59:36.840]   which means no provision even for the day,
[00:59:36.840 --> 00:59:40.660]   which means nothing even to keep provisions
[00:59:40.660 --> 00:59:42.020]   for the next day.
[00:59:42.020 --> 00:59:43.940]   Even if someone gives you something for the next day,
[00:59:43.940 --> 00:59:46.100]   you don't have anything to carry with you.
[00:59:46.100 --> 00:59:48.220]   And then verse nine, he says, just take your sandals.
[00:59:48.220 --> 00:59:50.380]   It's like, whew, we're gonna be walking a lot,
[00:59:50.380 --> 00:59:51.540]   at least we have a shoe.
[00:59:51.540 --> 00:59:54.040]   But then he says only one tunic, don't two, right?
[00:59:54.040 --> 00:59:58.040]   This thing, just imagine with me,
[00:59:58.040 --> 01:00:00.140]   like this passage doesn't say a whole lot
[01:00:00.140 --> 01:00:02.020]   about how the disciples reacted,
[01:00:02.020 --> 01:00:05.380]   but I wonder, we just have to wonder.
[01:00:05.380 --> 01:00:07.260]   So now I'm just reading into the white lines here
[01:00:07.260 --> 01:00:11.540]   and thinking like, someone must have thought like, what?
[01:00:11.540 --> 01:00:13.000]   That doesn't make any sense.
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:17.140]   You've already told us, like Jesus told them,
[01:00:17.140 --> 01:00:20.100]   you're going into dangerous land.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:23.540]   I'm sending you like sheep amongst wolves, right?
[01:00:23.540 --> 01:00:24.700]   But you have no food.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:25.700]   Like, what?
[01:00:25.700 --> 01:00:29.620]   And then you're supposed to eat off the fruit of your work.
[01:00:29.620 --> 01:00:31.740]   So then that means, like imagine with me
[01:00:31.740 --> 01:00:35.220]   if I said to you two or you two, I'm gonna pair you up
[01:00:35.220 --> 01:00:37.260]   and today we're gonna go out into Santa Ana,
[01:00:37.260 --> 01:00:38.860]   to Tustin, to different places,
[01:00:38.860 --> 01:00:40.860]   and we're gonna do two by two ministry.
[01:00:40.860 --> 01:00:44.300]   But the only way you eat is somebody,
[01:00:44.300 --> 01:00:45.400]   when you knock on their door,
[01:00:45.400 --> 01:00:47.900]   they invite you in and they feed you.
[01:00:47.900 --> 01:00:49.300]   And that's the food you get.
[01:00:50.300 --> 01:00:52.940]   Then you're calculating mind is basically concluding
[01:00:52.940 --> 01:00:55.820]   that I'm not eating.
[01:00:55.820 --> 01:00:58.020]   Because someone's gonna at the door be like,
[01:00:58.020 --> 01:01:00.420]   didn't I put up a sign, no soliciting.
[01:01:00.420 --> 01:01:02.540]   No, I don't want your warranty, get out of here.
[01:01:02.540 --> 01:01:03.620]   Here's my dog, right?
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:07.380]   Like, nobody nowadays is gonna knock on a door
[01:01:07.380 --> 01:01:09.480]   and they'll be so open to you.
[01:01:09.480 --> 01:01:12.680]   This is pretty extreme.
[01:01:12.680 --> 01:01:16.700]   And no tunics, just one, just whatever's on your back.
[01:01:16.700 --> 01:01:18.780]   I kind of like coiled at that.
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:20.300]   I own five suits.
[01:01:20.300 --> 01:01:23.580]   I have it really good in our day.
[01:01:23.580 --> 01:01:25.860]   Some of them don't fit now, but I still hold on to them,
[01:01:25.860 --> 01:01:27.940]   hoping they'll fit in the future.
[01:01:27.940 --> 01:01:29.860]   But is it, let me ask you a question.
[01:01:29.860 --> 01:01:32.900]   I do know some pastors who have taken a vow of poverty.
[01:01:32.900 --> 01:01:36.660]   Is that the application of this passage?
[01:01:36.660 --> 01:01:43.500]   Is it godlier and more true of discipleship
[01:01:43.500 --> 01:01:46.680]   to take a vow of poverty for anybody
[01:01:46.680 --> 01:01:47.900]   who is a man of the cloth?
[01:01:47.900 --> 01:01:50.000]   Like a pastor, a missionary.
[01:01:50.000 --> 01:01:52.460]   I don't think that's the case.
[01:01:52.460 --> 01:01:54.980]   And I'll show you why in a little bit,
[01:01:54.980 --> 01:01:58.460]   but the case that I've already presented to you is,
[01:01:58.460 --> 01:02:01.180]   every single disciple have already said,
[01:02:01.180 --> 01:02:02.260]   Lord, I'm willing to follow,
[01:02:02.260 --> 01:02:04.620]   and I believe that's why you're here.
[01:02:04.620 --> 01:02:06.580]   You're here because you have told the Lord,
[01:02:06.580 --> 01:02:09.660]   Lord, I love you because you love me,
[01:02:09.660 --> 01:02:12.020]   and I trust you that because you love me,
[01:02:12.020 --> 01:02:15.820]   you will care for my soul eternity and me today.
[01:02:15.820 --> 01:02:18.020]   And you will empower me in my mind and my heart
[01:02:18.020 --> 01:02:21.660]   and my body today, and so I'll follow you.
[01:02:21.660 --> 01:02:24.620]   But remember, the Lord loves you,
[01:02:24.620 --> 01:02:28.300]   and he will teach you what it means to follow.
[01:02:28.300 --> 01:02:31.500]   And he will test you to see how willing you are.
[01:02:31.500 --> 01:02:34.060]   But he'll also prepare you and instruct you
[01:02:34.060 --> 01:02:37.700]   to trust God that any follower of Jesus must know,
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:42.220]   I will entrust my entire being to God.
[01:02:42.220 --> 01:02:44.620]   And Christ has said to us,
[01:02:44.620 --> 01:02:46.100]   whenever you're doing a work,
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:48.140]   whenever you're doing a ministry,
[01:02:48.140 --> 01:02:49.620]   and whenever you're following,
[01:02:49.620 --> 01:02:52.820]   you must know that he cares for you.
[01:02:52.820 --> 01:02:54.980]   Your hairs are numbered.
[01:02:54.980 --> 01:02:58.940]   And just like everything under his power is under his care,
[01:02:58.940 --> 01:03:02.580]   even if you suffer, even if the world hates you,
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.460]   God cares for you.
[01:03:04.460 --> 01:03:09.260]   And you must know how secure you are in him.
[01:03:09.260 --> 01:03:10.460]   You must know it.
[01:03:10.460 --> 01:03:13.140]   If you're taking notes, write that down,
[01:03:13.140 --> 01:03:15.860]   like I must grow in my understanding
[01:03:15.860 --> 01:03:19.780]   of how much I can trust God.
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:22.100]   Because if your trust in God is compromised,
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:24.620]   you will be weak to every temptation.
[01:03:24.620 --> 01:03:26.820]   You will be weak to every scenario.
[01:03:26.820 --> 01:03:28.660]   And I wanna highlight something for you.
[01:03:28.660 --> 01:03:31.260]   I believe that the disciples were entering
[01:03:31.260 --> 01:03:33.460]   into some true testing ground,
[01:03:33.460 --> 01:03:37.700]   and they must trust the Lord rather than trust themselves.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:38.540]   Why?
[01:03:38.540 --> 01:03:41.140]   Because can you imagine if in their mind,
[01:03:41.140 --> 01:03:44.460]   their hearts were already compromised to some degree,
[01:03:44.460 --> 01:03:46.500]   like, oh my gosh, how am I gonna take care of myself?
[01:03:46.500 --> 01:03:48.060]   Oh my goodness, what about my family?
[01:03:48.060 --> 01:03:49.540]   Oh my goodness, what are we gonna eat?
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:52.140]   And so they took with them bags for money,
[01:03:52.140 --> 01:03:53.500]   bags for provisions.
[01:03:53.500 --> 01:03:57.660]   But if you are a miracle worker healing anybody
[01:03:57.660 --> 01:03:59.500]   who comes to you to the degree
[01:03:59.500 --> 01:04:02.020]   that you can raise somebody from the dead,
[01:04:02.020 --> 01:04:06.100]   can you imagine the temptation?
[01:04:06.100 --> 01:04:08.980]   Come here, come here, save my son, the rich man said.
[01:04:08.980 --> 01:04:11.340]   Take this, take this, take this, right?
[01:04:11.340 --> 01:04:14.820]   Can you imagine the temptation?
[01:04:14.820 --> 01:04:17.620]   Like even if you gathered a thousand people
[01:04:17.620 --> 01:04:19.340]   and you just sold hot dogs for a dollar,
[01:04:19.340 --> 01:04:21.340]   you'd be rich for the day.
[01:04:21.340 --> 01:04:24.820]   But you're healing and doing miracles, casting out demons.
[01:04:24.820 --> 01:04:29.740]   But if your trust in God was not tested,
[01:04:29.740 --> 01:04:33.380]   you would be susceptible to temptation, would you not?
[01:04:33.380 --> 01:04:37.700]   And I think Jesus was preparing these disciples.
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:41.260]   Jesus, at certain points, people wanted to come around him
[01:04:41.260 --> 01:04:43.100]   and making king by force.
[01:04:43.100 --> 01:04:46.460]   Some of the disciples were called Greek gods.
[01:04:46.460 --> 01:04:49.260]   Oh, you're like the messenger, right?
[01:04:49.260 --> 01:04:51.500]   You're like Zeus.
[01:04:51.500 --> 01:04:54.060]   Can you imagine the temptation that would come to us,
[01:04:54.060 --> 01:04:57.260]   to you and me, if we're doing the work of God,
[01:04:57.260 --> 01:04:59.020]   but we didn't trust him?
[01:04:59.020 --> 01:05:02.940]   I think we would be compromised.
[01:05:02.940 --> 01:05:05.740]   And so it's not so much that you have to take a vow
[01:05:05.740 --> 01:05:09.060]   of poverty and you're not allowed to have two suits.
[01:05:09.060 --> 01:05:11.060]   It's Jesus teaching his disciples
[01:05:11.060 --> 01:05:13.300]   on their first missions trip.
[01:05:13.300 --> 01:05:16.860]   I want you to know what it means to trust God, amen?
[01:05:16.860 --> 01:05:18.220]   What a valuable lesson for us.
[01:05:18.220 --> 01:05:20.460]   And now I share with you on a personal level.
[01:05:20.460 --> 01:05:25.220]   I still, I've shared this almost like three out of four times
[01:05:25.220 --> 01:05:27.660]   that I think, 'cause racial-wise that I preach,
[01:05:27.660 --> 01:05:29.260]   I talk about like the insecurities
[01:05:29.260 --> 01:05:30.900]   that come from doing ministry.
[01:05:30.900 --> 01:05:34.820]   If you've ever led a team, so much work to do, right?
[01:05:34.820 --> 01:05:37.260]   If you've ever led anything,
[01:05:37.260 --> 01:05:39.340]   you are gonna be faced with insecurity
[01:05:39.340 --> 01:05:43.420]   about whether you are sufficient or you could do the job.
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:45.700]   But if you keep focusing on that,
[01:05:45.700 --> 01:05:49.540]   you are going to regularly feel deficiency, yes?
[01:05:49.540 --> 01:05:54.460]   Your flesh will rise up to the occasion
[01:05:54.460 --> 01:05:56.260]   and be like, "You can do it!"
[01:05:56.260 --> 01:05:57.500]   (laughs)
[01:05:57.500 --> 01:06:00.420]   "It's no problem, you're prepared for this."
[01:06:00.420 --> 01:06:02.860]   And this whole world is constantly teaching you,
[01:06:02.860 --> 01:06:04.940]   you've got education, you've got know-how,
[01:06:04.940 --> 01:06:07.580]   you've got experience, don't worry, you can do it.
[01:06:07.580 --> 01:06:09.580]   And then my heart keeps telling me,
[01:06:09.580 --> 01:06:12.300]   "I need to mature," and maturity means
[01:06:12.300 --> 01:06:14.020]   I need to grow independent.
[01:06:14.020 --> 01:06:17.700]   Whereas God keeps telling me,
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:22.460]   "No, even if you're 40, 50, 60, 70, 80 years old,
[01:06:22.460 --> 01:06:25.460]   "you will never cease to be my dependent child.
[01:06:25.460 --> 01:06:28.060]   "You will ask me for provision."
[01:06:28.060 --> 01:06:31.860]   As a grown adult, you know how humbling it is
[01:06:31.860 --> 01:06:36.860]   to ask another adult for a provision for the day, right?
[01:06:36.860 --> 01:06:41.460]   Your flesh keeps telling you to secure your own benefits,
[01:06:41.460 --> 01:06:44.860]   to secure yourself in the midst of feeling needy,
[01:06:44.860 --> 01:06:47.740]   but God teaches us, "I will provide for you
[01:06:47.740 --> 01:06:51.420]   "when you do my work, and you will never outgrow
[01:06:51.420 --> 01:06:56.420]   "your childlike faith, your dependency with me."
[01:06:56.420 --> 01:06:58.340]   And I feel like that's a lesson
[01:06:58.340 --> 01:07:00.380]   I keep, keep learning every season.
[01:07:01.260 --> 01:07:06.260]   Lord, teach me to know I will always depend on you,
[01:07:06.260 --> 01:07:11.060]   and teach me to know if I don't, I'm compromised.
[01:07:11.060 --> 01:07:12.940]   That's a conviction we all need, amen?
[01:07:12.940 --> 01:07:16.220]   So, I wanted to highlight a passage to you
[01:07:16.220 --> 01:07:19.340]   that I do believe this is what Jesus was teaching.
[01:07:19.340 --> 01:07:22.660]   Because take a look at Luke chapter 22 in your Bibles,
[01:07:22.660 --> 01:07:25.140]   verse 35 to 37.
[01:07:25.140 --> 01:07:27.340]   Take a look later down the line,
[01:07:27.340 --> 01:07:30.300]   after Jesus has sent them, and I want you to know
[01:07:30.300 --> 01:07:32.380]   that Jesus has sent many other disciples.
[01:07:32.380 --> 01:07:36.140]   These 12 were primary because they are the apostles
[01:07:36.140 --> 01:07:38.400]   setting the stage for the church.
[01:07:38.400 --> 01:07:40.620]   But there were many other disciples
[01:07:40.620 --> 01:07:43.220]   who Jesus sent with the exact same instructions.
[01:07:43.220 --> 01:07:46.220]   In Luke chapter 10, there were 70 disciples.
[01:07:46.220 --> 01:07:47.500]   Later on in other passages,
[01:07:47.500 --> 01:07:49.540]   there were more disciples that he sent.
[01:07:49.540 --> 01:07:52.220]   But after he sends them, like a good leader,
[01:07:52.220 --> 01:07:54.500]   he has recap meeting.
[01:07:54.500 --> 01:07:56.420]   Have you guys been on a missions trip meeting,
[01:07:56.420 --> 01:07:57.660]   or missions trip and afterwards
[01:07:57.660 --> 01:07:59.660]   you have review and recap meeting?
[01:07:59.660 --> 01:08:02.020]   Well, that's kind of like what Jesus has.
[01:08:02.020 --> 01:08:04.380]   In Luke chapter 22, this is what he says.
[01:08:04.380 --> 01:08:07.620]   And he said to them, "When I sent you out with money belts,
[01:08:07.620 --> 01:08:10.360]   "oh, sorry, when I sent you out without money belts,
[01:08:10.360 --> 01:08:15.360]   "and bags and sandals, you did not lack anything, did you?"
[01:08:15.360 --> 01:08:17.920]   Teaching moment of Jesus.
[01:08:17.920 --> 01:08:21.340]   And they said, "No, nothing."
[01:08:21.340 --> 01:08:24.740]   What a valuable lesson for them.
[01:08:24.740 --> 01:08:27.480]   And he said to them, "But now, whoever has a money belt
[01:08:27.480 --> 01:08:28.400]   "is to take it along.
[01:08:28.400 --> 01:08:30.860]   "Likewise, also a bag and whoever has no sword
[01:08:30.860 --> 01:08:33.380]   "is to sell his coat and buy one."
[01:08:33.380 --> 01:08:35.620]   What I'm trying to tell you is not,
[01:08:35.620 --> 01:08:37.420]   oh, now it's okay, but what I'm trying to tell you,
[01:08:37.420 --> 01:08:40.100]   the main point of it was to teach them.
[01:08:40.100 --> 01:08:42.780]   Haven't you experienced it in your own life?
[01:08:42.780 --> 01:08:44.540]   You're so scared to do something
[01:08:44.540 --> 01:08:46.940]   that you felt like God wanted you to do?
[01:08:46.940 --> 01:08:50.200]   It could be just as simple as you're at your workplace,
[01:08:50.200 --> 01:08:51.840]   or you have a neighbor and you're like,
[01:08:51.840 --> 01:08:54.580]   oh gosh, this is like a pretty opportune moment
[01:08:54.580 --> 01:08:56.620]   to open my mouth and invite them to church,
[01:08:56.620 --> 01:08:58.360]   or talk to them or ask them how they're doing,
[01:08:58.360 --> 01:09:01.620]   and share the faith, and you're so scared.
[01:09:01.620 --> 01:09:04.860]   And that feeling of fear is just so strong.
[01:09:04.860 --> 01:09:08.380]   God wanted you to embark on this ministry.
[01:09:08.380 --> 01:09:11.100]   Maybe you were thinking about a literal missions trip,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:14.220]   and you're all afraid, like I don't have $3,000
[01:09:14.220 --> 01:09:16.900]   for a plane trip and all that stuff.
[01:09:16.900 --> 01:09:19.520]   But let me ask you about after you did it.
[01:09:19.520 --> 01:09:25.200]   Did you not feel a sense of like, that was great?
[01:09:26.300 --> 01:09:29.240]   Even if you were hungry, tired, and you didn't get to eat
[01:09:29.240 --> 01:09:31.200]   because the missions trip was so busy,
[01:09:31.200 --> 01:09:32.840]   even if X, Y, and Z happened,
[01:09:32.840 --> 01:09:37.420]   didn't you feel like, I didn't necessarily lack anything.
[01:09:37.420 --> 01:09:39.440]   Now I feel even more empowered.
[01:09:39.440 --> 01:09:42.040]   I can take over the world.
[01:09:42.040 --> 01:09:46.440]   Maybe not like that, but did you feel like regret
[01:09:46.440 --> 01:09:49.420]   that you trusted God for your daily provision?
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:52.400]   Did you feel a miss, like, oh, I shouldn't have done it.
[01:09:52.400 --> 01:09:54.300]   I shouldn't have gone on that mission trip.
[01:09:54.300 --> 01:09:57.960]   I don't think there was ever a person who felt like that.
[01:09:57.960 --> 01:09:59.320]   Where you wanted to love somebody
[01:09:59.320 --> 01:10:01.040]   by meeting with them for counseling,
[01:10:01.040 --> 01:10:02.360]   or you wanted to talk to somebody
[01:10:02.360 --> 01:10:03.880]   to try to do ministry in their lives,
[01:10:03.880 --> 01:10:07.340]   and then you thought, gosh, no.
[01:10:07.340 --> 01:10:11.120]   Jesus has the same review with his disciples,
[01:10:11.120 --> 01:10:12.480]   and says, that's what I was teaching you.
[01:10:12.480 --> 01:10:14.540]   You lacked nothing.
[01:10:14.540 --> 01:10:17.800]   And so I say again, we must heed the words of God
[01:10:17.800 --> 01:10:19.520]   that we must trust.
[01:10:19.520 --> 01:10:22.360]   Luke chapter 12, he says, I say to you, my friends,
[01:10:22.360 --> 01:10:25.420]   do not be afraid of those who kill the body and after
[01:10:25.420 --> 01:10:27.500]   that I have no more that they can do.
[01:10:27.500 --> 01:10:30.140]   But I warn you, whom to fear?
[01:10:30.140 --> 01:10:32.120]   Fear the one who after he has killed
[01:10:32.120 --> 01:10:33.660]   has authority to cast into hell.
[01:10:33.660 --> 01:10:35.980]   Yes, I tell you, fear him.
[01:10:35.980 --> 01:10:38.620]   Are not five sparrows sold for two cents?
[01:10:38.620 --> 01:10:40.500]   Yet not one of them is forgotten before God.
[01:10:40.500 --> 01:10:44.400]   Indeed, the very hairs of your head are all numbered.
[01:10:44.400 --> 01:10:45.780]   Do not fear.
[01:10:45.780 --> 01:10:48.760]   You are more valuable than many sparrows.
[01:10:48.760 --> 01:10:51.700]   And I say to you, everyone who confesses me before men,
[01:10:51.700 --> 01:10:55.140]   the Son of Man will confess him also before the angels
[01:10:55.140 --> 01:10:58.900]   of God, but he who denies me before men will be denied
[01:10:58.900 --> 01:11:00.620]   before the angels of God.
[01:11:00.620 --> 01:11:03.700]   This passage, Jesus regularly does this,
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:06.340]   of like this crazy up and down, or maybe down and up,
[01:11:06.340 --> 01:11:08.380]   where it's like, you better fear God.
[01:11:08.380 --> 01:11:10.780]   It's like, he cares for you so much.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:13.580]   Oh, it's this crazy thing.
[01:11:13.580 --> 01:11:16.280]   But the point again with number two was,
[01:11:16.280 --> 01:11:18.740]   rather than trying to secure anything of our own,
[01:11:18.740 --> 01:11:22.140]   we have to learn in ministry to trust the Lord fully.
[01:11:22.140 --> 01:11:24.260]   Principle number three.
[01:11:24.260 --> 01:11:25.700]   This is the last principle.
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:31.640]   Please do not demand success,
[01:11:31.640 --> 01:11:35.900]   but instead be willing always to simply be bold for Christ.
[01:11:35.900 --> 01:11:39.720]   The summary there is be bold for Christ always,
[01:11:39.720 --> 01:11:42.460]   but do not demand or expect the kind of success
[01:11:42.460 --> 01:11:44.260]   you hope to see.
[01:11:44.260 --> 01:11:46.740]   Do not demand the kind of success that you saw
[01:11:46.740 --> 01:11:47.900]   in other people.
[01:11:47.900 --> 01:11:51.340]   Well, that guy had X, Y, and Z.
[01:11:51.340 --> 01:11:55.360]   Pulpit ministry, lot of big crowds, X, Y, and Z.
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:56.860]   Do not expect the kind of success
[01:11:56.860 --> 01:11:58.560]   that other generations have had.
[01:11:58.560 --> 01:12:01.380]   Well, the early church had X, Y, and Z.
[01:12:01.380 --> 01:12:03.080]   Well, you know, earlier than them,
[01:12:03.080 --> 01:12:05.240]   they had also people who were killed.
[01:12:05.240 --> 01:12:10.060]   We dare not demand of God a kind of success that we saw,
[01:12:10.060 --> 01:12:12.620]   and therefore all of a sudden expect.
[01:12:12.620 --> 01:12:14.820]   Take a look at this interesting passage,
[01:12:14.820 --> 01:12:17.980]   the last portion of Mark chapter six, verse 10 and 11,
[01:12:17.980 --> 01:12:20.600]   and I'll explain to you how I get there,
[01:12:20.600 --> 01:12:24.500]   meaning what do I mean just simply be bold in Christ?
[01:12:24.500 --> 01:12:26.100]   Notice in verse 10 it says,
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:29.900]   "Wherever you enter a house, stay there until you leave town.
[01:12:29.900 --> 01:12:32.960]   "Any place that does not receive you or listen to you
[01:12:32.960 --> 01:12:34.400]   "as you go out from there,
[01:12:34.400 --> 01:12:38.420]   "but shake the dust off the soles of your feet
[01:12:38.420 --> 01:12:40.800]   "for a testimony against them."
[01:12:42.300 --> 01:12:47.300]   What I'm saying is Jesus was not giving any promises
[01:12:47.300 --> 01:12:51.380]   of how people will react.
[01:12:51.380 --> 01:12:54.140]   The full gamut was there, was it not?
[01:12:54.140 --> 01:12:57.220]   Some people will ask you to come into their house and stay.
[01:12:57.220 --> 01:12:58.820]   Some people will love you.
[01:12:58.820 --> 01:13:01.240]   Others, they'll tell you to get out, right?
[01:13:01.240 --> 01:13:04.100]   But what's really interesting is
[01:13:04.100 --> 01:13:06.980]   this passage strikes me as really odd,
[01:13:06.980 --> 01:13:11.700]   and I wonder if in our day, again, we wanna imagine,
[01:13:11.700 --> 01:13:13.700]   if I asked you to go to this house
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.460]   and evangelize to this home,
[01:13:16.460 --> 01:13:18.980]   and I said, "If they reject you,
[01:13:18.980 --> 01:13:21.860]   "consider it like they rejected Christ,
[01:13:21.860 --> 01:13:26.700]   "and just right in front of them, shake it off."
[01:13:26.700 --> 01:13:29.000]   Or let me throw at you another scenario.
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:31.740]   You know how we have Harvest Crusade here in Anaheim,
[01:13:31.740 --> 01:13:34.480]   and there's thousands of people who come.
[01:13:34.480 --> 01:13:35.980]   They have a great band,
[01:13:35.980 --> 01:13:38.460]   and everybody is moved and warmed, and they're challenged,
[01:13:38.460 --> 01:13:41.360]   and then the pastor gives an altar call and says,
[01:13:41.360 --> 01:13:43.880]   "Come, come one, come all.
[01:13:43.880 --> 01:13:46.080]   "Come to the saving graces of Christ.
[01:13:46.080 --> 01:13:48.140]   "Repent of your sins, and He'll forgive you."
[01:13:48.140 --> 01:13:49.980]   And so a bunch of people come.
[01:13:49.980 --> 01:13:53.000]   But then, imagine if the pastor says,
[01:13:53.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   "I noticed that a bunch of you have not come.
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:59.280]   "For you have not come, you have rejected the only way,
[01:13:59.280 --> 01:14:02.320]   "the only name, the only life, the only truth,
[01:14:02.320 --> 01:14:05.100]   "so now go to hell."
[01:14:05.100 --> 01:14:08.680]   Like, oh, everyone's jaw would just drop, right?
[01:14:09.620 --> 01:14:11.960]   Like, what did he just say, right?
[01:14:11.960 --> 01:14:13.080]   That would be wild.
[01:14:13.080 --> 01:14:18.360]   But I want you to think about the disciples thinking like,
[01:14:18.360 --> 01:14:21.880]   you want us to take off our shoes and dust the dirt off,
[01:14:21.880 --> 01:14:24.080]   and then basically leave a testimony
[01:14:24.080 --> 01:14:27.200]   of like you're judged and condemned, and then leave?
[01:14:27.200 --> 01:14:29.040]   That's strange, right?
[01:14:29.040 --> 01:14:31.440]   And then can you imagine two of the guys going out,
[01:14:31.440 --> 01:14:34.560]   and I kind of imagine myself in that scenario,
[01:14:34.560 --> 01:14:36.560]   and I'd probably look at my friend and be like,
[01:14:36.560 --> 01:14:38.320]   "Hehe, you do it first."
[01:14:38.320 --> 01:14:40.740]   (laughs)
[01:14:40.740 --> 01:14:42.700]   And then I'll do it so that as soon as we do it,
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:43.700]   we can leave, right?
[01:14:43.700 --> 01:14:50.260]   Just imagine the mentality that you would need to do that.
[01:14:50.260 --> 01:14:53.160]   Let me throw out to you another scenario.
[01:14:53.160 --> 01:14:55.660]   Remember how I told you that, wow,
[01:14:55.660 --> 01:15:00.260]   the mentality that you would need to go two by two
[01:15:00.260 --> 01:15:03.100]   into all the cities is heightened by the fact
[01:15:03.100 --> 01:15:05.380]   that they went into the heart of Jerusalem.
[01:15:06.540 --> 01:15:08.780]   Let me highlight this for you just real briefly.
[01:15:08.780 --> 01:15:12.160]   In Matthew chapter 10, verses one through 15,
[01:15:12.160 --> 01:15:14.920]   Jesus gives the disciples, it's a corollary passage,
[01:15:14.920 --> 01:15:16.760]   and describes what he said to them.
[01:15:16.760 --> 01:15:18.640]   But what's very interesting about this passage
[01:15:18.640 --> 01:15:20.600]   is that he summoned them, he gave them authority,
[01:15:20.600 --> 01:15:23.020]   and then in verse five, he says,
[01:15:23.020 --> 01:15:25.760]   "The twelve were sent out after being instructed,
[01:15:25.760 --> 01:15:28.160]   "and he said, 'Do not go in the way of the Gentiles.
[01:15:28.160 --> 01:15:30.480]   "'Do not enter any city of the Samaritans,
[01:15:30.480 --> 01:15:34.840]   "'but rather go to the lost sheep of the house of Israel.'"
[01:15:34.840 --> 01:15:36.660]   And then he gives the whole shebang of,
[01:15:36.660 --> 01:15:39.440]   don't take anything with you, don't take any provisions,
[01:15:39.440 --> 01:15:41.620]   just live by the provisions that people give you,
[01:15:41.620 --> 01:15:45.900]   and when they reject you, shake the dust off your feet.
[01:15:45.900 --> 01:15:48.100]   Let me give you another picture in your head.
[01:15:48.100 --> 01:15:49.980]   Imagine with me, I said,
[01:15:49.980 --> 01:15:53.040]   brothers and sisters, this summer, praise God,
[01:15:53.040 --> 01:15:56.260]   the windows are open and we can go do evangelism overseas.
[01:15:56.260 --> 01:15:59.460]   But rather than go to India, rather than go to China,
[01:15:59.460 --> 01:16:01.780]   we're gonna go somewhere else, somewhere hard.
[01:16:01.780 --> 01:16:03.860]   And you're thinking, Africa,
[01:16:03.860 --> 01:16:06.620]   some of the most hard places are places
[01:16:06.620 --> 01:16:09.900]   where there's just not even half a percent Christians,
[01:16:09.900 --> 01:16:14.900]   Somalia, Algeria, Yemen, not even half a percent, right?
[01:16:14.900 --> 01:16:18.180]   But I say, no, we're gonna go to,
[01:16:18.180 --> 01:16:20.280]   bum, bum, bum, the Vatican.
[01:16:20.280 --> 01:16:25.740]   That place is 100% Catholic,
[01:16:25.740 --> 01:16:27.700]   and there resides the Pope,
[01:16:27.700 --> 01:16:29.660]   there resides people of authority,
[01:16:29.660 --> 01:16:31.580]   they have a military of their own,
[01:16:31.580 --> 01:16:33.220]   they have a budget like no other,
[01:16:33.220 --> 01:16:34.940]   and when they register themselves,
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:36.460]   and when they put onto their website,
[01:16:36.460 --> 01:16:37.460]   all this kind of stuff,
[01:16:37.460 --> 01:16:41.140]   they consider themselves 100% already saved.
[01:16:41.140 --> 01:16:44.140]   Therefore, you and I, that's right, just you and me,
[01:16:44.140 --> 01:16:47.060]   we're gonna go in there with nothing.
[01:16:47.060 --> 01:16:48.260]   (laughs)
[01:16:48.260 --> 01:16:51.860]   No food, no provision, and we're gonna evangelize.
[01:16:51.860 --> 01:16:56.220]   You see, that means you must think
[01:16:56.220 --> 01:17:00.900]   you have so much power, right?
[01:17:00.900 --> 01:17:04.620]   You must have the authority of God
[01:17:04.620 --> 01:17:06.980]   to tell these people to repent.
[01:17:06.980 --> 01:17:10.340]   And that's where my conviction was.
[01:17:10.340 --> 01:17:13.800]   Like, whoa, for us, we complain about,
[01:17:13.800 --> 01:17:16.420]   these people won't listen, this isn't working,
[01:17:16.420 --> 01:17:18.660]   and then we start adjusting our stuff.
[01:17:18.660 --> 01:17:20.340]   We don't need to adjust anything.
[01:17:20.340 --> 01:17:25.100]   This passage, to me, strikes us super weird,
[01:17:25.100 --> 01:17:27.900]   because, I mean, honestly speaking, again,
[01:17:27.900 --> 01:17:29.720]   how many of us are going to be like,
[01:17:29.720 --> 01:17:32.420]   yeah, that's right, you didn't listen, so forget you.
[01:17:32.420 --> 01:17:34.560]   Well, let me tell you one thing.
[01:17:34.560 --> 01:17:37.520]   I don't think it's right for us to say forget you,
[01:17:37.520 --> 01:17:39.420]   'cause that's just an attitude, right?
[01:17:39.420 --> 01:17:41.060]   It wouldn't be right for the disciples
[01:17:41.060 --> 01:17:42.820]   who just a year and a half, two years ago,
[01:17:42.820 --> 01:17:45.000]   were just as pagan as everybody else.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:46.680]   They were Christless.
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:48.580]   They may have been a Jew going to the temple,
[01:17:48.580 --> 01:17:50.780]   but they were Christless.
[01:17:50.780 --> 01:17:52.860]   So for them, one and a half years later,
[01:17:52.860 --> 01:17:55.960]   to go to cities and be like, repent, or forget you,
[01:17:55.960 --> 01:17:57.700]   I don't think that's what they did.
[01:17:58.640 --> 01:18:00.700]   You see, 'cause one extreme of the
[01:18:00.700 --> 01:18:02.060]   shake the dust off their feet
[01:18:02.060 --> 01:18:04.900]   could be me just having a personality
[01:18:04.900 --> 01:18:07.500]   where it's, that's right, we're soldiers for Christ,
[01:18:07.500 --> 01:18:09.580]   and you're either in or you're out.
[01:18:09.580 --> 01:18:11.700]   Take it or leave it.
[01:18:11.700 --> 01:18:15.480]   That's not the attitude by which the God of heavens
[01:18:15.480 --> 01:18:19.620]   has sent the invitation of his grace.
[01:18:19.620 --> 01:18:21.160]   That's not right.
[01:18:21.160 --> 01:18:23.800]   However, my conviction is,
[01:18:23.800 --> 01:18:27.820]   neither is the attitude when we go into a city scared.
[01:18:27.820 --> 01:18:31.120]   Oh, please, please give Jesus a chance.
[01:18:31.120 --> 01:18:34.520]   I will confess, like early on in my days
[01:18:34.520 --> 01:18:37.900]   when I was doing the, like, what you call the random EV,
[01:18:37.900 --> 01:18:40.920]   what I like to call cold turkey EV, right?
[01:18:40.920 --> 01:18:42.360]   You go out and you just pray.
[01:18:42.360 --> 01:18:45.800]   God, give us divine appointment today, right?
[01:18:45.800 --> 01:18:48.320]   And I remember not too long ago going to the UTC area,
[01:18:48.320 --> 01:18:51.160]   and then there was a group of the Saturday bikers,
[01:18:51.160 --> 01:18:52.760]   you know, the guys who are in the tight things
[01:18:52.760 --> 01:18:55.280]   and in their shoes, and they're sitting around eating coffee.
[01:18:55.280 --> 01:18:56.360]   And you go over there and you say,
[01:18:56.360 --> 01:18:58.800]   hey, I wanna ask you, we've got that survey.
[01:18:58.800 --> 01:19:01.160]   So you go, would you mind taking a spiritual survey?
[01:19:01.160 --> 01:19:02.800]   And you give it to him, and the first question is like,
[01:19:02.800 --> 01:19:04.160]   did you grow up in the church?
[01:19:04.160 --> 01:19:05.160]   He takes a look at it, and he's like,
[01:19:05.160 --> 01:19:07.160]   dude, you think we wanna take a survey?
[01:19:07.160 --> 01:19:10.160]   And my first response was, oh, shoot, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[01:19:10.160 --> 01:19:11.760]   And I actually said, like, sorry, sorry, you're right,
[01:19:11.760 --> 01:19:13.280]   right, and I moved on.
[01:19:13.280 --> 01:19:15.280]   And then I was like, oh my gosh,
[01:19:15.280 --> 01:19:18.360]   I just apologize to this guy, 'cause he rejected me.
[01:19:18.360 --> 01:19:20.760]   You know, like, there's an emotional up and down
[01:19:20.760 --> 01:19:22.660]   when you experience that stuff, right?
[01:19:24.960 --> 01:19:29.640]   Man, I'm trying to regularly combat,
[01:19:29.640 --> 01:19:33.800]   my eyes tell me that rejection is so hard,
[01:19:33.800 --> 01:19:38.800]   awkwardness is so massive, and everything doesn't work.
[01:19:38.800 --> 01:19:41.940]   But God says you have such power to transform the world.
[01:19:41.940 --> 01:19:44.340]   Not because of your gusto,
[01:19:44.340 --> 01:19:47.340]   not because of your warrior mentality,
[01:19:47.340 --> 01:19:50.400]   but just because the pure reality,
[01:19:50.400 --> 01:19:53.120]   God of heavens has made an invitation.
[01:19:54.620 --> 01:19:56.640]   And his sovereignty and salvation means,
[01:19:56.640 --> 01:19:59.240]   yes, I may go randomly,
[01:19:59.240 --> 01:20:02.520]   but according to his great divine appointment,
[01:20:02.520 --> 01:20:05.320]   those who are worthy, those who God has called,
[01:20:05.320 --> 01:20:06.460]   are going to respond.
[01:20:06.460 --> 01:20:09.440]   And I need to go with boldness.
[01:20:09.440 --> 01:20:10.900]   I don't need to complain, like,
[01:20:10.900 --> 01:20:12.920]   Lord, these people, they're not listening.
[01:20:12.920 --> 01:20:14.520]   I don't need to ask God, like,
[01:20:14.520 --> 01:20:17.420]   give me other people to preach to, or something like that.
[01:20:17.420 --> 01:20:20.440]   We don't need to complain, like,
[01:20:20.440 --> 01:20:22.440]   oh, Lord, the ground is so hard out there.
[01:20:22.440 --> 01:20:24.540]   He already told us it would be.
[01:20:24.540 --> 01:20:27.480]   But he has given us this challenge,
[01:20:27.480 --> 01:20:31.960]   would you, are you willing to be so bold
[01:20:31.960 --> 01:20:34.220]   to a crooked and perverse generation?
[01:20:34.220 --> 01:20:37.440]   I want you to preach that the king is here.
[01:20:37.440 --> 01:20:39.720]   That's what he said.
[01:20:39.720 --> 01:20:41.860]   He told his disciples,
[01:20:41.860 --> 01:20:45.140]   I want you to be willing to preach that the king is here.
[01:20:45.140 --> 01:20:51.100]   And so, I will read for you this passage in Matthew,
[01:20:51.100 --> 01:20:54.760]   where Jesus has said, Matthew 10, 16.
[01:20:54.760 --> 01:20:57.860]   I send you out as sheep in the midst of wolves,
[01:20:57.860 --> 01:21:00.800]   so be shrewd as serpents and innocent as doves.
[01:21:00.800 --> 01:21:03.700]   But beware of men, for they will hand you over to the courts
[01:21:03.700 --> 01:21:05.540]   and scourge you in their synagogues,
[01:21:05.540 --> 01:21:07.500]   and you will even be brought before governors
[01:21:07.500 --> 01:21:10.340]   and kings for my sake, as a testimony to them
[01:21:10.340 --> 01:21:12.240]   and to the Gentiles.
[01:21:12.240 --> 01:21:14.980]   But when they hand you over, do not worry,
[01:21:14.980 --> 01:21:18.740]   trust in God, about how or what you are to say,
[01:21:18.740 --> 01:21:21.340]   for it will be given to you, that hour,
[01:21:21.340 --> 01:21:23.740]   what you are to say, for it is not you who speak,
[01:21:23.740 --> 01:21:27.100]   but it is the spirit of your father who speaks in you.
[01:21:27.100 --> 01:21:31.280]   You will hit a wall, and they will send you to the courts.
[01:21:31.280 --> 01:21:35.300]   Don't be surprised, but it is to your blessing
[01:21:35.300 --> 01:21:38.740]   that you can share in the sufferings of Christ.
[01:21:38.740 --> 01:21:40.880]   You just need to be willing.
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.660]   I wanna conclude by encouraging you with this idea
[01:21:45.660 --> 01:21:49.660]   of when does Jesus think you're ready to do his ministry?
[01:21:49.660 --> 01:21:55.200]   When are you ready to do anything?
[01:21:55.200 --> 01:21:57.880]   As a pastor over our singles ministry,
[01:21:57.880 --> 01:21:59.380]   I get this question a lot.
[01:21:59.380 --> 01:22:02.820]   Pastor, when am I ready to get married?
[01:22:02.820 --> 01:22:07.060]   And then sometimes to tease them,
[01:22:07.060 --> 01:22:08.300]   I give them this weird thing that's like,
[01:22:08.300 --> 01:22:11.620]   just the fact that you don't know when you're not ready.
[01:22:11.620 --> 01:22:12.820]   And they're like, oh no.
[01:22:13.860 --> 01:22:17.220]   But actually, there are a lot of questions about readiness.
[01:22:17.220 --> 01:22:19.060]   There are people with baptism who will ask me,
[01:22:19.060 --> 01:22:21.660]   pastor, I believe on the name of Jesus,
[01:22:21.660 --> 01:22:23.940]   and I know I'm a sinner, and I know he's gracious,
[01:22:23.940 --> 01:22:27.460]   but oh, I'm so wretched, and so many things are wrong.
[01:22:27.460 --> 01:22:30.300]   I don't know if I'm ready to be baptized.
[01:22:30.300 --> 01:22:35.900]   Think about that question, and I wanna encourage your heart.
[01:22:35.900 --> 01:22:38.960]   When Jesus is training his disciples,
[01:22:40.220 --> 01:22:44.060]   his thought of their readiness for it
[01:22:44.060 --> 01:22:47.620]   was not dependent on their resume of experience,
[01:22:47.620 --> 01:22:51.200]   skill, know-how, and productivity.
[01:22:51.200 --> 01:22:55.420]   Because you actually know what happens soon after this.
[01:22:55.420 --> 01:22:58.620]   This is before Jesus goes to the cross,
[01:22:58.620 --> 01:23:02.460]   before he is resurrected, you already know the story,
[01:23:02.460 --> 01:23:04.540]   that they have a great moment of obedience.
[01:23:04.540 --> 01:23:07.140]   Scripture says they went out, they preached repentance,
[01:23:07.140 --> 01:23:09.460]   they healed people, and with the authority of Christ,
[01:23:09.460 --> 01:23:11.300]   they anointed people.
[01:23:11.300 --> 01:23:12.900]   That's a beautiful thing.
[01:23:12.900 --> 01:23:14.420]   They did it, they obeyed.
[01:23:14.420 --> 01:23:18.380]   But you know their track record.
[01:23:18.380 --> 01:23:21.580]   But I began this sermon with the question,
[01:23:21.580 --> 01:23:24.860]   Jesus is training your willingness and trust.
[01:23:24.860 --> 01:23:28.980]   Are you willing to trust enough
[01:23:28.980 --> 01:23:31.580]   that you would take the whole shebang of ministry,
[01:23:31.580 --> 01:23:34.220]   all its heartaches and frustrations?
[01:23:34.220 --> 01:23:37.300]   Are you willing to trust yourself and your provisions?
[01:23:38.220 --> 01:23:39.660]   Are you willing to trust him?
[01:23:39.660 --> 01:23:43.940]   Are you willing to know that he has already prepared a way,
[01:23:43.940 --> 01:23:47.140]   and you do not need to secure your own success,
[01:23:47.140 --> 01:23:50.660]   you just need to be willing to follow boldly
[01:23:50.660 --> 01:23:52.620]   where Christ is leading.
[01:23:52.620 --> 01:23:57.480]   And in that way, for us, I believe in our church,
[01:23:57.480 --> 01:24:00.260]   there is actually a great readiness and opportunity
[01:24:00.260 --> 01:24:02.000]   for people to serve.
[01:24:02.000 --> 01:24:07.000]   And in terms of the need, the need is always going to exceed
[01:24:07.180 --> 01:24:10.100]   and outpace what we can do.
[01:24:10.100 --> 01:24:12.680]   But nevertheless, the Lord is going to challenge us.
[01:24:12.680 --> 01:24:15.600]   I will train you, I will provide for you.
[01:24:15.600 --> 01:24:16.780]   Are you willing?
[01:24:16.780 --> 01:24:17.620]   Let's pray.
[01:24:17.620 --> 01:24:23.980]   Lord, Heavenly Father,
[01:24:23.980 --> 01:24:27.660]   we take this challenge from your word.
[01:24:27.660 --> 01:24:30.060]   Ultimately, God, we're talking about evangelism,
[01:24:30.060 --> 01:24:32.100]   we're talking about your kingdom work,
[01:24:32.100 --> 01:24:34.260]   and the ministry of your church,
[01:24:34.260 --> 01:24:37.420]   tending to the weak,
[01:24:37.420 --> 01:24:40.520]   ministering to those who are lost,
[01:24:40.520 --> 01:24:43.500]   but at the same time, we hear this exhortation,
[01:24:43.500 --> 01:24:45.800]   we need to trust you fully.
[01:24:45.800 --> 01:24:48.960]   I do pray, God, that you would teach us what that means,
[01:24:48.960 --> 01:24:52.540]   but also, I pray we will experience it.
[01:24:52.540 --> 01:24:54.660]   And we as a church would be those
[01:24:54.660 --> 01:24:57.240]   who do not hide in the pews,
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:01.700]   but rather, God, with great, great confidence in you,
[01:25:01.700 --> 01:25:04.520]   so simply following your lead,
[01:25:04.520 --> 01:25:08.140]   God, we would be used to great ends for your cause.
[01:25:08.140 --> 01:25:10.180]   I pray, Father God, that just like the apostles
[01:25:10.180 --> 01:25:12.720]   who would praise you after being whooped,
[01:25:12.720 --> 01:25:14.660]   say what the apostles from old say,
[01:25:14.660 --> 01:25:16.060]   "Lord, thank you, God,
[01:25:16.060 --> 01:25:19.260]   "we praise you for counting us worthy enough,"
[01:25:19.260 --> 01:25:20.620]   that in the end, we would be expended
[01:25:20.620 --> 01:25:22.900]   and used for your cause.
[01:25:22.900 --> 01:25:25.020]   And I pray, Lord, that all the fears,
[01:25:25.020 --> 01:25:27.060]   all the anxiety we have,
[01:25:27.060 --> 01:25:30.220]   would truly be rested at the foot of Christ.
[01:25:31.340 --> 01:25:34.640]   But ultimately, thank you so much.
[01:25:34.640 --> 01:25:36.580]   Thank you so much, God,
[01:25:36.580 --> 01:25:38.940]   that you want to use us to this end,
[01:25:38.940 --> 01:25:41.740]   that you want to train and build us up.
[01:25:41.740 --> 01:25:43.780]   So we pray that in all of our lives,
[01:25:43.780 --> 01:25:46.900]   we would aspire to the full maturity of Christ.
[01:25:46.900 --> 01:25:49.560]   We thank you, and it's in his name we pray, amen.
[01:25:49.560 --> 01:25:53.640]   At this time, we would like to participate
[01:25:53.640 --> 01:25:55.660]   in the communion together,
[01:25:55.660 --> 01:25:58.700]   but before we do, we want to prepare our hearts,
[01:25:58.700 --> 01:26:00.560]   so there should be a cup,
[01:26:00.560 --> 01:26:03.660]   so please make sure you grab one.
[01:26:03.660 --> 01:26:06.420]   And then as you do, please consider
[01:26:06.420 --> 01:26:09.480]   that the communion is a unique time for us
[01:26:09.480 --> 01:26:11.740]   to remember our Savior,
[01:26:11.740 --> 01:26:13.900]   and proclaim what he's done for us,
[01:26:13.900 --> 01:26:15.940]   to say, "He died for me,
[01:26:15.940 --> 01:26:21.140]   "that my sins have been borne on his shoulders,
[01:26:21.140 --> 01:26:23.820]   "and then wiped away," right?
[01:26:23.820 --> 01:26:25.140]   That he shed his blood for me,
[01:26:25.140 --> 01:26:28.180]   and by the blood of the cross, I'm clean.
[01:26:28.180 --> 01:26:29.600]   And so this is a remembrance,
[01:26:29.600 --> 01:26:31.420]   and this is an act that we do to say,
[01:26:31.420 --> 01:26:36.100]   "Lord, you have been so good to me, thank you," right?
[01:26:36.100 --> 01:26:37.100]   And that being the case,
[01:26:37.100 --> 01:26:40.100]   for some of you who are here with us today,
[01:26:40.100 --> 01:26:42.640]   if you do not know you're standing with Christ,
[01:26:42.640 --> 01:26:45.140]   I ask you to take time to consider.
[01:26:45.140 --> 01:26:50.020]   You don't, please don't participate in the communion yet,
[01:26:50.020 --> 01:26:53.020]   because you have to first deal with Christ.
[01:26:53.020 --> 01:26:56.460]   And ask yourself, do I believe that Jesus is the Son of God,
[01:26:56.460 --> 01:27:00.640]   who was sent and came on a rescue mission for me?
[01:27:00.640 --> 01:27:03.440]   That although I'm a sinner,
[01:27:03.440 --> 01:27:06.200]   that by simple request of forgiveness,
[01:27:06.200 --> 01:27:09.240]   by the power of the work that you've done,
[01:27:09.240 --> 01:27:13.000]   you've already told us you're willing to forgive,
[01:27:13.000 --> 01:27:15.760]   because you were already willing to sacrifice, to suffer,
[01:27:15.760 --> 01:27:18.320]   and to bear everything on the cross.
[01:27:18.320 --> 01:27:21.160]   And please know that you are able, even today,
[01:27:21.160 --> 01:27:24.960]   to ask in the name of Christ to receive forgiveness.
[01:27:24.960 --> 01:27:27.260]   So with that said, we're gonna take time now
[01:27:27.260 --> 01:27:31.300]   to first hear the passage from the scripture,
[01:27:31.300 --> 01:27:32.900]   and then we'll participate.
[01:27:32.900 --> 01:27:36.600]   It says in 1 Corinthians chapter 11,
[01:27:36.600 --> 01:27:40.540]   "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered
[01:27:40.540 --> 01:27:42.240]   "to you, that the Lord Jesus,
[01:27:42.240 --> 01:27:45.080]   "in the night in which he was betrayed, took bread,
[01:27:45.080 --> 01:27:47.240]   "and when he had given thanks, he broke it and said,
[01:27:47.240 --> 01:27:49.500]   "this is my body, which is for you.
[01:27:49.500 --> 01:27:51.600]   "Do this in remembrance of me.
[01:27:51.600 --> 01:27:54.020]   "In the same way, he took the cup also after supper,
[01:27:54.020 --> 01:27:58.360]   "saying, this cup is the new covenant in my blood.
[01:27:58.360 --> 01:28:01.620]   "Do this as often as you drink it in remembrance of me.
[01:28:01.620 --> 01:28:04.580]   "For as often as you eat this bread and drink the cup,
[01:28:04.580 --> 01:28:07.960]   "you proclaim the Lord's death until he comes.
[01:28:07.960 --> 01:28:10.640]   "Therefore, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup
[01:28:10.640 --> 01:28:12.720]   "of the Lord in an unworthy manner,
[01:28:12.720 --> 01:28:15.580]   "shall be guilty of the body and the blood of the Lord.
[01:28:15.580 --> 01:28:19.160]   "But a man must examine himself, and in so doing,
[01:28:19.160 --> 01:28:21.840]   "he is to eat of the bread and drink of the cup.
[01:28:21.840 --> 01:28:24.560]   "For he who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment
[01:28:24.560 --> 01:28:29.560]   "to himself if he does not judge the body rightly."
[01:28:29.560 --> 01:28:31.140]   Let's actually take a moment,
[01:28:31.140 --> 01:28:35.220]   if you can individually just pray.
[01:28:35.220 --> 01:28:38.580]   Please pray a prayer of thankfulness for the work of Christ
[01:28:38.580 --> 01:28:42.180]   and who he is to you, but also if there's any unconfessed
[01:28:42.180 --> 01:28:45.140]   sin, take time now to lift those up to the Lord.
[01:28:45.140 --> 01:28:47.900]   And in a brief moment, I'll gather us together
[01:28:47.900 --> 01:28:49.460]   to take part in the communion.
[01:28:50.860 --> 01:28:53.940]   (gentle piano music)
[01:28:53.940 --> 01:28:57.020]   (gentle piano music)
[01:28:57.020 --> 01:29:00.100]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:00.100 --> 01:29:03.180]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:04.060 --> 01:29:07.140]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:07.140 --> 01:29:20.220]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:20.220 --> 01:29:23.300]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:23.300 --> 01:29:34.380]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:34.380 --> 01:29:43.380]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:43.980 --> 01:29:47.060]   (gentle piano music)
[01:29:47.060 --> 01:30:00.380]   (gentle piano music)
[01:30:00.380 --> 01:30:02.700]   At this time, if you have not already,
[01:30:02.700 --> 01:30:06.940]   please go ahead and join us in opening up the elements.
[01:30:06.940 --> 01:30:08.780]   Please know that there are two layers.
[01:30:08.780 --> 01:30:11.860]   The top layer is clear, and when you peel it back,
[01:30:11.860 --> 01:30:14.660]   it reveals the white wafer.
[01:30:14.660 --> 01:30:17.860]   And the Lord has said to us that this is his body,
[01:30:17.860 --> 01:30:20.100]   broken for you, please take of it.
[01:30:20.100 --> 01:30:28.900]   And then the purple film there is removed
[01:30:28.900 --> 01:30:32.060]   to reveal the grape juice.
[01:30:32.060 --> 01:30:35.460]   And the Lord has said that this is his blood,
[01:30:35.460 --> 01:30:39.180]   spilled on our behalf, the blood of the new covenant.
[01:30:39.180 --> 01:30:40.460]   Please take this down too.
[01:30:40.460 --> 01:30:43.540]   (gentle piano music)
[01:30:43.540 --> 01:30:49.140]   Amen, please join me in prayer.
[01:30:49.140 --> 01:30:53.900]   All right, God, as we as a church participate
[01:30:53.900 --> 01:30:58.340]   in that together, we want to thank you, thank you, thank you.
[01:30:58.340 --> 01:31:03.340]   God, again, this is not something, Lord, that we approach.
[01:31:03.340 --> 01:31:05.220]   The communion is not something that we come to
[01:31:05.220 --> 01:31:08.260]   by any merit of our own, but clearly, God,
[01:31:08.260 --> 01:31:11.500]   we simply receive what you have done for us.
[01:31:11.500 --> 01:31:15.380]   And we do so by faith, we do so, Father God,
[01:31:15.380 --> 01:31:16.780]   in love for you.
[01:31:16.780 --> 01:31:20.900]   I pray that you would truly use us to proclaim your name.
[01:31:20.900 --> 01:31:22.580]   I ask that the power of the gospel
[01:31:22.580 --> 01:31:24.300]   would be strong in our hearts,
[01:31:24.300 --> 01:31:26.980]   and I pray that we would be so willing to be bold,
[01:31:26.980 --> 01:31:29.940]   believing in the power of the cross.
[01:31:29.940 --> 01:31:34.060]   But ultimately, Lord, help us simply to be found faithful,
[01:31:34.060 --> 01:31:36.300]   to lift up to you our praise,
[01:31:36.300 --> 01:31:38.700]   our offering of our lives to you.
[01:31:38.700 --> 01:31:41.980]   And we pray that all of that would be pleasing in your sight.
[01:31:41.980 --> 01:31:45.580]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[01:31:45.580 --> 01:31:48.100]   Please join me in rising for the closing song.
[01:31:48.100 --> 01:31:55.980]   (gentle piano music)

[01:35:34.340 --> 01:35:37.380]   Our Father, we lift up the final prayer to you
[01:35:37.380 --> 01:35:39.220]   this morning service.
[01:35:39.220 --> 01:35:42.180]   God, asking truly that you would grant to us
[01:35:42.180 --> 01:35:44.420]   conviction of faith.
[01:35:44.420 --> 01:35:47.820]   Lord, that what we have in the gospel is so grand,
[01:35:47.820 --> 01:35:50.060]   such a incredible treasure,
[01:35:50.060 --> 01:35:53.420]   that it comes with power to change the world.
[01:35:53.420 --> 01:35:56.300]   We repent of the fact that at times,
[01:35:56.300 --> 01:36:00.860]   perhaps we're so apologetic and we lack the confidence,
[01:36:00.860 --> 01:36:03.340]   almost acting as though we're trying to convince people
[01:36:03.340 --> 01:36:05.840]   to buy something not worthy.
[01:36:05.840 --> 01:36:08.900]   But rather, we know that what we have in the gospel
[01:36:08.900 --> 01:36:11.360]   is the invitation of the Almighty God,
[01:36:11.360 --> 01:36:13.420]   the maker of the universe.
[01:36:13.420 --> 01:36:15.420]   And so I pray in the way that we speak,
[01:36:15.420 --> 01:36:18.540]   we would simply represent your reality.
[01:36:18.540 --> 01:36:22.060]   I also pray that you would grant to us the heart of Christ.
[01:36:22.060 --> 01:36:25.260]   You have challenged us in our Bible study in 1 Peter,
[01:36:25.260 --> 01:36:28.460]   that we are to glory in sharing the suffering
[01:36:28.460 --> 01:36:30.540]   of the ministry of Christ.
[01:36:30.540 --> 01:36:32.740]   So I pray for every servant in this room
[01:36:32.740 --> 01:36:34.960]   trying to love on a brother or sister,
[01:36:34.960 --> 01:36:38.140]   trying to evangelize to a family member or friend,
[01:36:38.140 --> 01:36:42.220]   that God, we carry with us the privilege
[01:36:42.220 --> 01:36:44.820]   of the ministry of Christ in our lives.
[01:36:44.820 --> 01:36:47.100]   Would you help us to be emboldened?
[01:36:47.100 --> 01:36:48.580]   Would you help us to trust you
[01:36:48.580 --> 01:36:51.340]   for all the fruit that is to be born?
[01:36:51.340 --> 01:36:54.300]   Now to him who was able to keep you from stumbling
[01:36:54.300 --> 01:36:56.540]   and to make you stand in the presence of his glory,
[01:36:56.540 --> 01:36:58.580]   blameless with great joy,
[01:36:58.580 --> 01:37:02.220]   to the only God our Savior through Jesus Christ our Lord,
[01:37:02.220 --> 01:37:04.980]   be glory and majesty, dominion and authority
[01:37:04.980 --> 01:37:08.800]   before all time and now and forever, amen.
