[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   Alright, if you could turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 10, and I will read from
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:12.600]   14 all the way to the end of the chapter.
[00:00:12.600 --> 00:00:14.720]   But focus on verse 16 and on.
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.240]   Romans chapter 10, verse 14 through 21.
[00:00:19.240 --> 00:00:22.600]   How then will they call on him in whom they have not believed?
[00:00:22.600 --> 00:00:26.320]   And how are they to believe in him of whom they have never heard?
[00:00:26.320 --> 00:00:29.040]   And how are they to hear without someone preaching?
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:31.280]   And how are they to preach unless they are sent?
[00:00:31.280 --> 00:00:35.160]   As it is written, how beautiful are the feet of those who preach the good news.
[00:00:35.160 --> 00:00:37.000]   But they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:40.880]   For Isaiah says, "Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?"
[00:00:40.880 --> 00:00:44.280]   So faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ.
[00:00:44.280 --> 00:00:46.040]   But I ask, have they not heard?
[00:00:46.040 --> 00:00:47.820]   Indeed they have.
[00:00:47.820 --> 00:00:51.960]   For their voice has gone out to all the earth and their words to enter the world.
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:54.440]   But I ask, did Israel not understand?
[00:00:54.440 --> 00:00:58.240]   First Moses says, "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation.
[00:00:58.240 --> 00:01:00.560]   For the foolish nation I will make you angry."
[00:01:00.560 --> 00:01:06.560]   Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, "I have been found by those who did not seek me.
[00:01:06.560 --> 00:01:09.960]   I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me."
[00:01:09.960 --> 00:01:15.320]   But of Israel, he says, "All day long I have held out my hand to a disobedient and contrary
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.320]   people."
[00:01:16.320 --> 00:01:18.320]   Let's pray.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:24.720]   Heavenly Father, we want to again thank you.
[00:01:24.720 --> 00:01:27.040]   We want to praise you, Father God.
[00:01:27.040 --> 00:01:33.280]   We know that even our ability to persevere is because of your grace.
[00:01:33.280 --> 00:01:39.240]   I pray that your spirit would break through our hearts, open our ears, Lord God, that
[00:01:39.240 --> 00:01:44.200]   we may hear your voice and nothing else.
[00:01:44.200 --> 00:01:49.480]   I pray, Father God, that even our worship, we are dependent upon you to stir us and to
[00:01:49.480 --> 00:01:51.420]   move us.
[00:01:51.420 --> 00:01:57.420]   So we ask, Lord God, that what we are not able to do, that your Holy Spirit would continue
[00:01:57.420 --> 00:02:04.380]   to intercede on our behalf, groaning, Father God, because we do desire to be near you.
[00:02:04.380 --> 00:02:08.260]   We pray, Father, your spirit would guide and lead us, empower, strengthen us, and feed
[00:02:08.260 --> 00:02:09.260]   us this morning.
[00:02:09.260 --> 00:02:13.840]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:18.560]   You know, recently, Esther and I, I would say it's probably more than recent, but Esther
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:24.200]   and I, we've been just walking around our neighborhood, you know, because I have bad
[00:02:24.200 --> 00:02:27.920]   knees, I can't do anything rigorous, so Esther and I have been just walking around our neighborhood,
[00:02:27.920 --> 00:02:33.280]   and it's been a habit, like every night we walk to the, I don't know if it's called,
[00:02:33.280 --> 00:02:35.400]   Irvine Lake, Lake in Yale.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:36.920]   Well, you know what lake I'm talking about.
[00:02:36.920 --> 00:02:39.600]   There's a lake in Yale, in Irvine.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:44.800]   And I remember years ago, the very first time I came to Irvine in 1991, I ran into that
[00:02:44.800 --> 00:02:49.560]   lake and it was, to me, it was like, oh my God, there's a lake in the middle of the city,
[00:02:49.560 --> 00:02:50.920]   and it was man-made.
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:52.540]   And I found out there's two of them.
[00:02:52.540 --> 00:02:55.440]   And I was just dumbfounded, just how beautiful that was.
[00:02:55.440 --> 00:02:58.240]   Like, people actually live here in front of this, you know.
[00:02:58.240 --> 00:03:03.240]   And I mean, my parents moved around so much, like I've been, just even in Southern California,
[00:03:03.240 --> 00:03:07.080]   I think I lived in almost every county, except for San Diego.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.440]   And so it was, to me, it was like, wow, this kind of place still, like, really exists.
[00:03:12.440 --> 00:03:17.440]   Before I became, I got married, even though it was beautiful, I didn't really appreciate
[00:03:17.440 --> 00:03:20.180]   it, you know, because you want action when you're young.
[00:03:20.180 --> 00:03:21.180]   You want things to be happening.
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:24.440]   You want to come outside the door and plenty of places to go.
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:28.480]   And now there's a lot more stuff going on in Irvine, but at that time, it was just residential.
[00:03:28.480 --> 00:03:32.160]   Even businesses, there are very few businesses in Irvine.
[00:03:32.160 --> 00:03:37.160]   So I got married, you know, I can appreciate Irvine, but I remember just about a week ago,
[00:03:37.160 --> 00:03:41.960]   Esther and I walked to the lake and I was sitting there, and I was just dumbfounded,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:46.200]   because you know, we lived maybe about two, three blocks away from this lake.
[00:03:46.200 --> 00:03:50.520]   And for years, I would say probably decades, I never have given a second thought, other
[00:03:50.520 --> 00:03:53.380]   than the very first time I ran into this lake.
[00:03:53.380 --> 00:03:56.520]   And I was just sitting there thinking, this is not real.
[00:03:56.520 --> 00:04:00.600]   I mean, for most people in the world, and I know a lot of people have the, you know,
[00:04:00.600 --> 00:04:03.320]   say Irvine is a bubble and it's not the real world.
[00:04:03.320 --> 00:04:05.600]   And in some sense, all of that is true.
[00:04:05.600 --> 00:04:10.360]   And I remember just sitting there, just appreciating the lake, thinking, this is not real.
[00:04:10.360 --> 00:04:16.080]   You know, we travel to remote parts of India and even in rich places, like whether it's
[00:04:16.080 --> 00:04:19.960]   Tokyo or Seoul or Beijing, you know, you don't run into this kind of stuff.
[00:04:19.960 --> 00:04:23.160]   I bet you, if I took pictures of this and sent this out, and it's like, this is in your
[00:04:23.160 --> 00:04:27.880]   backyard, not literally backyard, but walking distance, right?
[00:04:27.880 --> 00:04:33.660]   And as I was contemplating and thinking about that, it just kind of made me think about
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:35.720]   my relationship with God.
[00:04:35.720 --> 00:04:42.560]   That, you know, how when you first encounter God, how floored we are about His grace.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.720]   That the God of the universe would even know my name.
[00:04:46.720 --> 00:04:51.800]   And then to think that that God not only knows my name, but He cared enough to send His only
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:54.680]   begotten Son to die for me.
[00:04:54.680 --> 00:05:00.360]   And how that just changes you, changes us, and changed me.
[00:05:00.360 --> 00:05:08.240]   But years go by, struggles, ups and downs of life, temptations, distractions.
[00:05:08.240 --> 00:05:14.960]   And as years go by, you know, the Christianity can easily become just a routine.
[00:05:14.960 --> 00:05:15.960]   We know what to do.
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:20.760]   There's a knee-jerk reaction, and you walk by this lake so many times, it's just there.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:26.400]   And you don't really think deeply about what it is exactly that we have.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:30.560]   As strange as it is, sitting in front of that lake kind of made me think about that.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   Like how blessed I am, what it is that I have.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:37.600]   I mean, obviously physically blessed, but especially spiritually.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:43.560]   To know that the greatest question that every human being, Christian or not, asks, what
[00:05:43.560 --> 00:05:46.200]   is my purpose?
[00:05:46.200 --> 00:05:47.840]   Where am I headed?
[00:05:47.840 --> 00:05:50.340]   What's going to happen to me after I die?
[00:05:50.340 --> 00:05:57.000]   The most fundamental question of mankind is answered for us as Christians, that God loves
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:05:58.440]   us.
[00:05:58.440 --> 00:06:01.600]   That there's a purpose, there's a clear reason why He created us.
[00:06:01.600 --> 00:06:06.520]   There's a goal that we're running toward, and at the end of it, no matter what happens,
[00:06:06.520 --> 00:06:09.640]   that when we die, we're going to be in heaven.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:12.960]   And to just live day to day, not being affected by that.
[00:06:12.960 --> 00:06:15.000]   So it kind of made me think about that.
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:18.760]   And the reason why I share this this morning is because the text that we're looking at
[00:06:18.760 --> 00:06:23.400]   this morning is an indictment against the nation of Israel.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:29.920]   And as you guys know, the nation of Israel has been blessed more than any other nation.
[00:06:29.920 --> 00:06:34.200]   All their holidays was in preparation for the coming of the Messiah.
[00:06:34.200 --> 00:06:36.360]   Every single holiday that they celebrated.
[00:06:36.360 --> 00:06:41.120]   I think the United States is particularly blessed in that sense, because the major holidays
[00:06:41.120 --> 00:06:45.360]   in the United States, it has Christian tones in it.
[00:06:45.360 --> 00:06:46.720]   It has Christian backgrounds.
[00:06:46.720 --> 00:06:51.960]   So it's not very hard as Christians when you're going abroad to teach English to teach
[00:06:51.960 --> 00:06:56.060]   about Christianity, because all you have to do is talk about the origin of the country
[00:06:56.060 --> 00:06:59.880]   and the Constitution and even on the money.
[00:06:59.880 --> 00:07:02.160]   It's embedded in there.
[00:07:02.160 --> 00:07:09.800]   But the nation of Israel in particular, their community centered around worshiping God.
[00:07:09.800 --> 00:07:13.100]   We're not talking about a portion of the community, the whole nation.
[00:07:13.100 --> 00:07:17.540]   Their beginning of the nation was that God would set up his tabernacle and every single
[00:07:17.540 --> 00:07:21.660]   tribe would camp around this tabernacle.
[00:07:21.660 --> 00:07:26.680]   And so everything that they did centered around the worship of God.
[00:07:26.680 --> 00:07:30.940]   God's glory rested upon this temple that they built.
[00:07:30.940 --> 00:07:38.280]   So people are always looking for God's glory, but God's glory dwelt in their midst physically.
[00:07:38.280 --> 00:07:43.500]   Their history is a record of God's faithfulness to their nation.
[00:07:43.500 --> 00:07:49.340]   So whether they go back 500 years or a thousand years or 1500 years, every portion of Israel's
[00:07:49.340 --> 00:07:52.040]   history is about God's faithfulness to them.
[00:07:52.040 --> 00:07:56.460]   So they can sit around and just talk about what happened and their forefathers and every
[00:07:56.460 --> 00:08:01.300]   single year that they study, it's a reminder of God's grace and love for them.
[00:08:01.300 --> 00:08:07.700]   Their heroes, their forefathers, they were all men and women who represented God's presence.
[00:08:07.700 --> 00:08:14.700]   Israel, ultimately, was the line in which the Messiah himself was going to come.
[00:08:14.700 --> 00:08:20.140]   I mean, we can go on and on about how blessed they were.
[00:08:20.140 --> 00:08:26.940]   Paul says in Romans 3, 1 and 2, above all of that, he begins the book of Romans by saying,
[00:08:26.940 --> 00:08:28.500]   "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:08:28.500 --> 00:08:30.020]   Whether you had the law or didn't have the law.
[00:08:30.020 --> 00:08:34.700]   And he said, "Well, what advantage is there then to being a Jew?"
[00:08:34.700 --> 00:08:39.460]   I mean, of course, I've mentioned maybe only about five or six things, but the whole book
[00:08:39.460 --> 00:08:46.240]   of the Old Testament that we read is a constant reminder of God's grace and love to this nation.
[00:08:46.240 --> 00:08:51.820]   But if they're not saved, if they're in the same position as the Gentiles, then what benefit
[00:08:51.820 --> 00:08:54.260]   is there of being a Jew?
[00:08:54.260 --> 00:08:58.940]   And so Paul answers that question in Romans 3, 1 and 2, then what advantage has the Jew
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:01.700]   or what is the value of circumcision?
[00:09:01.700 --> 00:09:03.700]   Much in every way.
[00:09:03.700 --> 00:09:08.420]   To begin with, the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:09.980]   Now he could have mentioned all kinds of things.
[00:09:09.980 --> 00:09:13.300]   He could have mentioned any one of the things that I mentioned already.
[00:09:13.300 --> 00:09:17.500]   You have the holidays, you have the worship, you have the tabernacle, you have your history,
[00:09:17.500 --> 00:09:19.540]   you have the forefathers, you have his glory.
[00:09:19.540 --> 00:09:24.180]   And he could have mentioned all of that, but he says, "But to begin with, above all," he
[00:09:24.180 --> 00:09:27.260]   says, "they had the oracles of God."
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:31.940]   They were the first recipients of the gospel.
[00:09:31.940 --> 00:09:36.260]   The message of salvation, they were the very first ones.
[00:09:36.260 --> 00:09:47.780]   The tragedy of the church of Israel is also the tragedy of a post-Christian culture where
[00:09:47.780 --> 00:09:57.540]   we are surrounded by witnesses, history, commentaries, churches, preaching, Bible studies, fellowship,
[00:09:57.540 --> 00:10:06.620]   Christian work, funding, fellowship, and yet to be so far away from his presence.
[00:10:06.620 --> 00:10:11.820]   Hebrews chapter 6, 4 through 8, the author describes the same issue that the nation of
[00:10:11.820 --> 00:10:15.620]   Israel has and that Paul has been explaining up to this point.
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:19.820]   He says, "For it is impossible to restore again to repentance those who have once been
[00:10:19.820 --> 00:10:25.980]   enlightened who have tasted the heavenly gift and have shared in the Holy Spirit and have
[00:10:25.980 --> 00:10:30.900]   tasted the goodness of the word of God and powers of the age to come, if they then fall
[00:10:30.900 --> 00:10:36.540]   away since they are crucifying once again the Son of God to their own harm and holding
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.140]   him up to contempt."
[00:10:38.140 --> 00:10:43.060]   Now some people have read this text and said, "Well, it sounds like the author is saying
[00:10:43.060 --> 00:10:48.740]   that if you were a Christian and then you fall away, that you lose your salvation."
[00:10:48.740 --> 00:10:51.900]   Clearly that's not what he's teaching because one, it's inconsistent with the other teachings
[00:10:51.900 --> 00:10:58.300]   in the Bible, and if you read in context of what he says, clearly he's not talking about
[00:10:58.300 --> 00:11:01.340]   a Christian who's losing his salvation.
[00:11:01.340 --> 00:11:07.340]   He's describing an individual who is in the church, who's hearing the same gospel, part
[00:11:07.340 --> 00:11:12.060]   of the same prayer meeting, he benefits from the fellowship, encouragement of brothers
[00:11:12.060 --> 00:11:17.580]   and sisters, of older Christians who have surrounded them, opportunity to serve and
[00:11:17.580 --> 00:11:23.580]   give in every aspect, they have the same advantage of every person in the church.
[00:11:23.580 --> 00:11:30.620]   And yet they refuse, they refuse to accept Jesus Christ.
[00:11:30.620 --> 00:11:35.060]   Verse 7 says, "For the land that has drunk the rain and often falls in it and produces
[00:11:35.060 --> 00:11:41.020]   a crop useful to those for whose sake it is cultivated receives a blessing from God.
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.340]   But if it bears thorns and thistles, it is worthless and near to being cursed and its
[00:11:45.340 --> 00:11:47.300]   end is to be burned."
[00:11:47.300 --> 00:11:54.780]   In other words, he's describing the crops that are receiving all the rain and so some
[00:11:54.780 --> 00:11:58.740]   of them receive the exact same amount of nutrients, the same amount, and some of them are bearing
[00:11:58.740 --> 00:12:04.060]   fruit and then this other group have the exact same opportunity, exact same teaching, and
[00:12:04.060 --> 00:12:05.940]   yet they're not bearing fruit.
[00:12:05.940 --> 00:12:11.300]   And as a result of that, it's a clear sign that they are not repenting.
[00:12:11.300 --> 00:12:22.140]   The nation of Israel had every advantage, they had every advantage to receive Christ.
[00:12:22.140 --> 00:12:27.860]   They should have been the first ones who ran to Christ when he appeared because their history,
[00:12:27.860 --> 00:12:31.500]   everything pointed to the coming of Christ.
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:37.380]   Even Jesus' genealogy, the reason why there's a careful record of the genealogy of Christ.
[00:12:37.380 --> 00:12:41.380]   We have two separate genealogies of Mary and Joseph.
[00:12:41.380 --> 00:12:45.500]   The reason why there's a careful description of the genealogy of Christ is because God
[00:12:45.500 --> 00:12:47.140]   has been keeping record.
[00:12:47.140 --> 00:12:50.660]   He promised that the seed of the woman is going to come and he's going to crush the
[00:12:50.660 --> 00:12:54.980]   head of the serpent, basically saying that he's going to come to save the world.
[00:12:54.980 --> 00:13:03.340]   And he kept a clear record of how he was fulfilling that from generation to generation to generation.
[00:13:03.340 --> 00:13:11.820]   And yet when Christ came, for the most part, they rejected him.
[00:13:11.820 --> 00:13:15.660]   That's the tragedy of the Jewish people.
[00:13:15.660 --> 00:13:19.660]   So when they stand before God, they have no excuse.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:26.140]   And again, that's a tragedy of a post-Christian culture where we don't lack any resources
[00:13:26.140 --> 00:13:28.220]   of any kind.
[00:13:28.220 --> 00:13:35.180]   You know, we have fellow brothers and sisters in India that it's hard for them to get together
[00:13:35.180 --> 00:13:38.980]   to even have prayer meetings because if they have it outside, they're going to get targeted.
[00:13:38.980 --> 00:13:39.980]   They might get stoned.
[00:13:39.980 --> 00:13:42.340]   A mob may come and beat them up.
[00:13:42.340 --> 00:13:47.740]   If you've been following the news about India, I mean, it's getting worse by the minute.
[00:13:47.740 --> 00:13:52.100]   I mean, there's shootings, there's beatings, there's deliberate attack.
[00:13:52.100 --> 00:13:54.860]   They would coax pastors to come, say, "Hey, we're interested in the gospel," and then
[00:13:54.860 --> 00:13:55.860]   jump them in the house.
[00:13:55.860 --> 00:13:58.460]   I mean, this is happening left and right.
[00:13:58.460 --> 00:14:02.220]   We're trying to help them build a center where at least they can come together and have prayer
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:04.100]   meetings, you know.
[00:14:04.100 --> 00:14:09.660]   But simple place to get together and pray for about 40 people, they don't have.
[00:14:09.660 --> 00:14:13.380]   You and I don't lack that resource.
[00:14:13.380 --> 00:14:17.160]   We can gather speakers.
[00:14:17.160 --> 00:14:19.180]   We have opportunity to serve.
[00:14:19.180 --> 00:14:22.660]   Plenty of brothers and sisters to run this race with, have fun with, raise our children
[00:14:22.660 --> 00:14:25.160]   with.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:31.920]   Like the Jews, if we don't recognize the gift that we have in Christ, we can live the
[00:14:31.920 --> 00:14:38.060]   rest of our lives thinking, "Only if, only if I had more of this, only if I had more
[00:14:38.060 --> 00:14:44.180]   of that, only if this was different in my life, I would be more faithful.
[00:14:44.180 --> 00:14:47.420]   Only if I was a little bit younger, only if I was a little bit older, only if I had a
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:50.680]   little bit more time."
[00:14:50.680 --> 00:14:55.060]   I'm not sure exactly what the thought of the Jews were, but the text that we're looking
[00:14:55.060 --> 00:14:59.620]   at this morning gives a threefold indictment against the nation of Israel.
[00:14:59.620 --> 00:15:04.100]   The first indictment, he says, is that Israel did not obey the gospel.
[00:15:04.100 --> 00:15:09.340]   Let me just read it as it says in verse 16, "But they have not all obeyed the gospel."
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:13.780]   Now when they say all here, it's clear in the context that he's referring to Jews, because
[00:15:13.780 --> 00:15:18.620]   in verse 18 and 19, he says, "But I ask, have they not heard?
[00:15:18.620 --> 00:15:21.280]   Indeed they have.
[00:15:21.280 --> 00:15:24.780]   For their voice has gone out to all the earth and their words to the ends of the world."
[00:15:24.780 --> 00:15:27.820]   So he's clearly referring to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:31.960]   And then if that wasn't clear enough, verse 19, he says, "But I ask, did Israel not understand?"
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.860]   First Moses says, "I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation."
[00:15:35.860 --> 00:15:41.460]   So clearly, when he says, "Not all have obeyed," he's referring to the Jews.
[00:15:41.460 --> 00:15:45.860]   All this point, up to this point, he's been describing how the gospel came to save the
[00:15:45.860 --> 00:15:47.540]   world.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:49.020]   But he says, "Not all of them."
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:53.460]   See the indictment against the Jews is that they did not obey.
[00:15:53.460 --> 00:15:58.300]   Now, one of the questions I asked online, if you were able to look at it last night
[00:15:58.300 --> 00:16:04.860]   before you went to sleep, is he describes obedience to the gospel.
[00:16:04.860 --> 00:16:06.180]   Typically we don't use that language.
[00:16:06.180 --> 00:16:08.380]   We say, "Believing the gospel."
[00:16:08.380 --> 00:16:11.220]   Maybe even accepting the gospel.
[00:16:11.220 --> 00:16:14.660]   But to obey the gospel, that language is consistent with other passages.
[00:16:14.660 --> 00:16:19.980]   In 2 Thessalonians 1.8, "Inflaming fire, inflicting vengeance on those who do not know
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:25.580]   God and on those who do not obey the gospel of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:16:25.580 --> 00:16:29.400]   He says it again in 1 Peter 4.17, "For it is time for judgment to begin in the household
[00:16:29.400 --> 00:16:30.400]   of God.
[00:16:30.400 --> 00:16:34.900]   And if it begins with us, what will it be the outcome for those who do not obey the
[00:16:34.900 --> 00:16:36.740]   gospel of God?"
[00:16:36.740 --> 00:16:42.940]   Now, obedience and faith, at least in this context, is used interchangeably.
[00:16:42.940 --> 00:16:48.260]   He says in verse 16, "Lord, who has believed what he has heard from us?"
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.580]   Faith comes from hearing and hearing through the word of Christ.
[00:16:51.580 --> 00:16:55.820]   So clearly, Paul is using the term obey and believe interchangeably.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.540]   Now, that doesn't mean that obey and faith is the same thing.
[00:17:01.540 --> 00:17:08.600]   Then we would be professing salvation by works, and we know that we don't believe that.
[00:17:08.600 --> 00:17:09.600]   Salvation is not by works.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.060]   Paul has spent 10 chapters describing that salvation is not by works.
[00:17:14.060 --> 00:17:18.500]   But what he does mean here is consistent with what he said before, that he who confesses
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:24.780]   that Christ is Lord, that he was buried and raised from the dead, he said he shall be
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:26.460]   saved.
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:32.720]   So genuine faith always leads to genuine fruit.
[00:17:32.720 --> 00:17:34.340]   Genuine faith leads to genuine fruit.
[00:17:34.340 --> 00:17:38.820]   It's not genuine faith and works that saves us.
[00:17:38.820 --> 00:17:44.180]   It's genuine faith will require or will lead to genuine fruit.
[00:17:44.180 --> 00:17:50.540]   Now, that's not something deeply theological in Scripture.
[00:17:50.540 --> 00:17:53.140]   That's just common sense.
[00:17:53.140 --> 00:17:57.900]   That if you trust somebody, if you really trust somebody, and it's not just words, then
[00:17:57.900 --> 00:18:00.420]   you would entrust him with things.
[00:18:00.420 --> 00:18:03.180]   So if a friend asked me, "Hey, do you trust me with your money?"
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:05.460]   And he says, "Yeah, of course I trust you."
[00:18:05.460 --> 00:18:07.460]   "Well, let me hold on to it."
[00:18:07.460 --> 00:18:08.460]   "No."
[00:18:08.460 --> 00:18:11.460]   "Well, then do you trust me?"
[00:18:11.460 --> 00:18:13.100]   "Yes, of course I trust you."
[00:18:13.100 --> 00:18:15.620]   "Well, let me hold on to your money."
[00:18:15.620 --> 00:18:16.620]   "No."
[00:18:16.620 --> 00:18:17.620]   "Why not?"
[00:18:17.620 --> 00:18:18.620]   "I don't know.
[00:18:18.620 --> 00:18:22.060]   I just can't let you."
[00:18:22.060 --> 00:18:26.920]   So the common sense would be, you say you trust me, but your actions say that you don't
[00:18:26.920 --> 00:18:27.920]   trust me.
[00:18:27.920 --> 00:18:30.740]   So that's not something deeply theological.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:32.500]   That's just common sense.
[00:18:32.500 --> 00:18:39.460]   Only when it comes to Christianity have we made this disconnect between belief and life.
[00:18:39.460 --> 00:18:41.620]   So basically what Paul is saying is just common sense.
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:43.780]   He's not saying that you need to work for your salvation.
[00:18:43.780 --> 00:18:49.560]   He's saying that if you genuinely do believe, that it would lead to a certain life.
[00:18:49.560 --> 00:18:55.380]   If you believe that this life is not it, it would change your anxiousness on all the things
[00:18:55.380 --> 00:18:58.100]   that are happening.
[00:18:58.100 --> 00:19:03.620]   That we would not live for tomorrow, but we would live for eternity, if that was our perspective.
[00:19:03.620 --> 00:19:08.940]   If we knew that heaven and hell really existed, it would change our paradigm as to how we
[00:19:08.940 --> 00:19:11.640]   value things, what is important, what is not important.
[00:19:11.640 --> 00:19:13.780]   So that's all Paul is saying.
[00:19:13.780 --> 00:19:16.260]   And so in that, he is indicting the nation of Israel.
[00:19:16.260 --> 00:19:19.380]   He said that they heard the truth, but they did not respond.
[00:19:19.380 --> 00:19:23.860]   They did not obey the gospel.
[00:19:23.860 --> 00:19:27.940]   It doesn't mean that if you genuinely believe the gospel, that you are all going to bear
[00:19:27.940 --> 00:19:29.580]   the same kind of fruit.
[00:19:29.580 --> 00:19:34.980]   Even in the seeds, it says some bore 30, some bore 60, some bore 100.
[00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:38.940]   So some are going to respond and bear a lot of fruit because of the faith that God's given
[00:19:38.940 --> 00:19:43.860]   them and some may have less faith and they're not going to bear as much fruit, but clearly
[00:19:43.860 --> 00:19:45.860]   there is fruit.
[00:19:45.860 --> 00:19:46.900]   And that's all Paul is saying.
[00:19:46.900 --> 00:19:51.980]   And Paul's first indictment against the nation of Israel was there was no fruit.
[00:19:51.980 --> 00:19:55.020]   You may have confessed, but there was no genuine fruit.
[00:19:55.020 --> 00:20:03.260]   See, in the nation of Israel, some who heard didn't believe and were hostile toward Christ.
[00:20:03.260 --> 00:20:06.300]   So clearly they did not believe.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:13.140]   Some followed superficially and they followed as long as Jesus was performing miracles,
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:17.740]   passing out food and saying kind things to people, how he was going to deliver them from
[00:20:17.740 --> 00:20:20.220]   bondage and he was going to deliver people from captivity.
[00:20:20.220 --> 00:20:25.300]   And as long as he was saying these general things of deliverance, they loved him.
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:32.220]   But when he began to indict them for their sins and he called them out for the hypocrisy
[00:20:32.220 --> 00:20:35.220]   and he began to say hard things and say, you know, I am the bread of life.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:40.060]   You're coming to me looking so that I will feed you, that I will heal you.
[00:20:40.060 --> 00:20:45.700]   But he said, I do all of these things to teach you that I came for a bigger purpose, to forgive
[00:20:45.700 --> 00:20:50.300]   you of your sins, to deliver you from your bondage.
[00:20:50.300 --> 00:20:54.340]   So there were a group of people who superficially seemed like they were following Jesus until
[00:20:54.340 --> 00:21:00.500]   Jesus disappointed them, that he wasn't quite the Messiah that they wanted.
[00:21:00.500 --> 00:21:03.740]   And as soon as they realized that he wasn't that Messiah, they turned away.
[00:21:03.740 --> 00:21:06.180]   That happens in John chapter 6.
[00:21:06.180 --> 00:21:11.860]   The multitude who ate the fish and the bread as a whole just turned away and no longer
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:13.740]   walked with him.
[00:21:13.740 --> 00:21:19.580]   Now if you lived in a culture where Christianity, there was hostility toward Christianity, that
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:26.700]   would naturally weed some people out because it requires sacrifice to be a part of a community.
[00:21:26.700 --> 00:21:32.440]   But that's the problem with a post-Christian culture, that you could harden your heart
[00:21:32.440 --> 00:21:37.100]   against God and you never said, I'm not going to follow Jesus.
[00:21:37.100 --> 00:21:41.700]   But in all practical purposes, that may have already happened in your heart, but we never
[00:21:41.700 --> 00:21:43.260]   leave the church.
[00:21:43.260 --> 00:21:49.220]   So the church is filled with followers of Jesus, people who are lukewarm, and people
[00:21:49.220 --> 00:21:51.460]   who have denied Christ.
[00:21:51.460 --> 00:21:56.260]   But we're all inside the church, and only God is going to determine at the end who is
[00:21:56.260 --> 00:21:57.260]   and who is not.
[00:21:57.260 --> 00:22:03.500]   See, but the nation of Israel, at least at that particular time, they had no reason to
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:06.100]   follow Christ because there was hostility against Jesus.
[00:22:06.100 --> 00:22:10.820]   So if you continue to follow Jesus, you have to live with the consequences, that the Pharisees
[00:22:10.820 --> 00:22:13.660]   and the leaders of Israel is going to come after them too.
[00:22:13.660 --> 00:22:17.940]   So as soon as they realized, this is not the Messiah I wanted, they quit and they fell
[00:22:17.940 --> 00:22:19.620]   apart.
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:26.700]   And then there was a group of people who actually did ministry with the apostles.
[00:22:26.700 --> 00:22:29.660]   They went and some of them even risked their lives.
[00:22:29.660 --> 00:22:34.500]   And yet Paul, at the end of his life, writing 2 Timothy, lists a group of people that are
[00:22:34.500 --> 00:22:37.460]   mentioned in the book of Acts.
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.700]   Some of these men and women are mentioned in the book of Acts, and as Paul is sitting
[00:22:40.700 --> 00:22:44.900]   in prison, and it looks like he's actually going to die, and that if they continue to
[00:22:44.900 --> 00:22:47.580]   follow this path, that they may also have to give their life.
[00:22:47.580 --> 00:22:51.900]   And he says many of them love the world more than they love Jesus.
[00:22:51.900 --> 00:22:53.420]   And so they went back home.
[00:22:53.420 --> 00:22:55.500]   That's how Paul describes them.
[00:22:55.500 --> 00:23:00.900]   Jesus describes them as a group of people, the third soil, that the concerns and worries
[00:23:00.900 --> 00:23:05.980]   of life choke out their faith, and then they eventually die.
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:10.700]   See, when Paul here, the first indictment against the nation of Israel was there was
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:13.860]   no fruit.
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:14.860]   They didn't persevere.
[00:23:14.860 --> 00:23:17.020]   They disobeyed the gospel.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.740]   But the second indictment against the nation of Israel was, well, maybe they didn't obey
[00:23:20.740 --> 00:23:22.020]   because they didn't hear.
[00:23:22.020 --> 00:23:24.340]   Maybe they didn't know.
[00:23:24.340 --> 00:23:29.780]   But the second indictment that he gives is that God pursued them with His Word through
[00:23:29.780 --> 00:23:32.500]   the prophets, but they did not repent.
[00:23:32.500 --> 00:23:35.100]   He gave them every opportunity to repent.
[00:23:35.100 --> 00:23:40.180]   It wasn't like God sent prophets and they whispered in the wilderness.
[00:23:40.180 --> 00:23:44.900]   I always think about Jonah, you know, when he preached at Nineveh.
[00:23:44.900 --> 00:23:48.220]   He probably was the worst preacher that ever existed.
[00:23:48.220 --> 00:23:52.180]   I mean, that's my guess, because he didn't want them to repent.
[00:23:52.180 --> 00:23:56.860]   Can you imagine somebody, you know, basically telling people to repent, and he doesn't want
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:58.540]   them to repent?
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:24:04.020]   You know, like when I prepare my sermon, I have to read it over and over again to make
[00:24:04.020 --> 00:24:05.660]   sure that you understand what I'm saying.
[00:24:05.660 --> 00:24:08.980]   So if I feel like, "Oh, I'm going to lose them here," and I go and review, and sometimes
[00:24:08.980 --> 00:24:13.700]   I review till late at night, and all with the intention of, "How do I get you to pay
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:14.700]   more attention?
[00:24:14.700 --> 00:24:18.260]   How do I get you to respond to the Word of God?"
[00:24:18.260 --> 00:24:22.620]   But if I didn't care, and if I, in fact, if my motive was, "I don't want you to listen
[00:24:22.620 --> 00:24:23.700]   to me.
[00:24:23.700 --> 00:24:28.220]   I want the wrath of God to come upon you," man, that would be an easy sermon to prepare.
[00:24:28.220 --> 00:24:31.780]   In fact, I wouldn't be preparing at all.
[00:24:31.780 --> 00:24:33.380]   I wouldn't be preparing at all.
[00:24:33.380 --> 00:24:35.520]   I just walk up here.
[00:24:35.520 --> 00:24:37.900]   Walk right up here and say, "Well, this is what God wants me to say."
[00:24:37.900 --> 00:24:40.780]   He says, "You know, if you don't repent, you're going to die."
[00:24:40.780 --> 00:24:41.860]   Then just walk off.
[00:24:41.860 --> 00:24:43.260]   I did my part.
[00:24:43.260 --> 00:24:47.100]   You told me to tell them, I told them, and I—that was Jonah.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:51.420]   See, but that was not the nation of Israel.
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.560]   Israel did not have a reluctant prophet.
[00:24:55.560 --> 00:25:00.100]   He says, "Faith comes from hearing, and the hearing of the Word of Christ."
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:03.260]   See, that was not the nation of Israel.
[00:25:03.260 --> 00:25:10.060]   Over and over again, God sent prophets—Hosea, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel—over and over
[00:25:10.060 --> 00:25:11.060]   again.
[00:25:11.060 --> 00:25:12.980]   You have prophets before the fall.
[00:25:12.980 --> 00:25:14.640]   You have prophets during the fall.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:17.060]   You have prophets after the fall.
[00:25:17.060 --> 00:25:18.060]   You have Moses.
[00:25:18.060 --> 00:25:19.060]   You have Elijah.
[00:25:19.060 --> 00:25:20.300]   You have Elisha.
[00:25:20.300 --> 00:25:23.820]   You have King David, handpicked by God.
[00:25:23.820 --> 00:25:28.000]   Everything about the nation of Israel was God constantly.
[00:25:28.000 --> 00:25:32.560]   Even during the period of judges, they would sin.
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.160]   They would fall under judgment.
[00:25:34.160 --> 00:25:35.680]   They would cry out to God.
[00:25:35.680 --> 00:25:36.860]   God would have mercy.
[00:25:36.860 --> 00:25:40.360]   He would raise up a leader, and the leader would lead them to revival.
[00:25:40.360 --> 00:25:44.000]   Then as soon as they become comfortable, they forget God, and they began to—and this cycle
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:45.320]   was on and on and on.
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:48.080]   So if you ever read the book of Judges, it's frustrating.
[00:25:48.080 --> 00:25:51.000]   It's like trying to teach a child who just will not listen.
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:55.120]   That's the nation of Israel, and they only pay attention when they get burned.
[00:25:55.120 --> 00:25:56.320]   That was nation of Israel.
[00:25:56.320 --> 00:26:01.440]   And yet, through hundreds and hundreds of Israel's history, years of Israel's history,
[00:26:01.440 --> 00:26:06.400]   God is pleading with them, sending prophet after prophet after prophet, pleading with
[00:26:06.400 --> 00:26:07.400]   them.
[00:26:07.400 --> 00:26:11.640]   Nineveh had this reluctant prophet walking around saying, "If you don't repent, you're
[00:26:11.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   going to get judged.
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:13.640]   You're going to get judged."
[00:26:13.640 --> 00:26:15.720]   And the whole nation repents.
[00:26:15.720 --> 00:26:17.360]   But it says, "of the nation of Israel."
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.540]   Is it because they did not hear?
[00:26:20.540 --> 00:26:23.980]   Is it because the word of God was not clear?
[00:26:23.980 --> 00:26:31.960]   Is it because God didn't send enough prophets or a prophet that was articulate?
[00:26:31.960 --> 00:26:35.120]   He says, "No, but I ask, have they not heard?
[00:26:35.120 --> 00:26:40.100]   Indeed they have, for their voice has gone out to all the earth, and the words to the
[00:26:40.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   ends of the world."
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:49.200]   God's been speaking to this nation one after another, after another, after another, and
[00:26:49.200 --> 00:26:50.840]   after another.
[00:26:50.840 --> 00:26:54.740]   In Amos chapter 3, verse 7, it says, "For the Lord God does nothing without revealing
[00:26:54.740 --> 00:26:58.220]   a secret to his servant, the prophet."
[00:26:58.220 --> 00:27:08.100]   In fact, in Ezekiel, when God is sending these prophets, Hosea, Isaiah, Ezekiel, Amos, all
[00:27:08.100 --> 00:27:13.900]   these pre-exile prophets to warn them that because of your sins, the judgment of God
[00:27:13.900 --> 00:27:16.760]   is coming, and you're going to go into captivity.
[00:27:16.760 --> 00:27:23.460]   Even in that context, Ezekiel 2, 4-5, it says, "The descendants also are impudent and stubborn.
[00:27:23.460 --> 00:27:28.160]   I send you to them, and you shall say to them, 'Thus says the Lord God,' and whether they
[00:27:28.160 --> 00:27:34.760]   hear or refuse to hear, for they are a rebellious house, they will know that a prophet has been
[00:27:34.760 --> 00:27:35.760]   among them."
[00:27:35.760 --> 00:27:40.260]   Now, Ezekiel, was he the only prophet?
[00:27:40.260 --> 00:27:42.860]   Was he the first prophet?
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.340]   He comes from a line, a succession of many, many prophets.
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:52.140]   In fact, Jesus constantly says, "You are like your forefathers who killed the prophets."
[00:27:52.140 --> 00:27:57.060]   And every prophet that Jesus would send, or God would send, they are the ones who get
[00:27:57.060 --> 00:27:58.060]   targeted.
[00:27:58.060 --> 00:27:59.060]   They were the ones stoned.
[00:27:59.060 --> 00:28:00.520]   They were the ones who were chased out of their city.
[00:28:00.520 --> 00:28:04.480]   And yet, in Ezekiel, before the judgment comes, you would think that God would throw up his
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.820]   hand and say, "You know, they have had every chance, and they still didn't listen."
[00:28:07.820 --> 00:28:11.360]   Instead, he sends another one.
[00:28:11.360 --> 00:28:12.360]   He sends another one.
[00:28:12.360 --> 00:28:17.580]   And he says, "They probably aren't going to listen, but I'm going to send you to them
[00:28:17.580 --> 00:28:19.140]   anyway.
[00:28:19.140 --> 00:28:23.220]   I'm going to send them to them anyway so that they at least know that a prophet was among
[00:28:23.220 --> 00:28:25.060]   them."
[00:28:25.060 --> 00:28:30.500]   That even if they don't know when he is there, maybe after they go into captivity and the
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:35.860]   judgment actually comes, they can look back and say, "Wow, Ezekiel, he was speaking for
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:37.940]   God, not these false prophets.
[00:28:37.940 --> 00:28:39.740]   Jeremiah was speaking for God.
[00:28:39.740 --> 00:28:41.060]   Isaiah was speaking for God.
[00:28:41.060 --> 00:28:42.320]   Hosea was speaking for God.
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:44.180]   Amos was speaking for God."
[00:28:44.180 --> 00:28:52.980]   And not only did God send them before the captivity, during captivity, Ezra, Nehemiah,
[00:28:52.980 --> 00:28:56.680]   over and over again, Hosea.
[00:28:56.680 --> 00:29:01.880]   He says, "Is it because they did not hear?
[00:29:01.880 --> 00:29:04.520]   Is it because they did not understand?"
[00:29:04.520 --> 00:29:05.520]   No.
[00:29:05.520 --> 00:29:12.600]   They had opportunity after opportunity after opportunity.
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:18.160]   They had plenty of opportunity with God sending his prophets to get them to repent, and they
[00:29:18.160 --> 00:29:19.160]   would not.
[00:29:19.160 --> 00:29:20.160]   That was their second indictment.
[00:29:20.160 --> 00:29:27.800]   Third and finally, he said, "Even the salvation of Gentiles was not to reject them, but to
[00:29:27.800 --> 00:29:29.160]   provoke them to jealousy."
[00:29:29.160 --> 00:29:34.280]   Even after all of that, he says, his final call to them was, "Now I'm going to take this
[00:29:34.280 --> 00:29:39.560]   gospel, I'm going to take this truth, and I'm going to allow the Ninevites to come in.
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:44.960]   I'm going to allow the other nations, the Gentiles, to come in."
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.880]   And he says, this is how it's described, verse 19, "But I ask, did Israel not understand?
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:53.200]   But Moses says, 'I will make you jealous of those who are not a nation, and with a foolish
[00:29:53.200 --> 00:29:55.960]   nation I will make you angry.'
[00:29:55.960 --> 00:30:01.800]   Then Isaiah is so bold as to say, 'I have been found by those who did not seek me, and
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:06.320]   I have shown myself to those who did not ask for me.'"
[00:30:06.320 --> 00:30:12.520]   He said he opened the door to the Gentiles to come in, not simply to use us to provoke
[00:30:12.520 --> 00:30:16.580]   them, but because he loved them.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:19.520]   So it wasn't that God was saying, "You know, I had enough."
[00:30:19.520 --> 00:30:23.620]   You would say, "You know, I had enough of you.
[00:30:23.620 --> 00:30:25.400]   How many times do I need to plead with you?
[00:30:25.400 --> 00:30:29.680]   How many times do I need to send the prophet and you kill my servants before I say enough
[00:30:29.680 --> 00:30:30.680]   with you?
[00:30:30.680 --> 00:30:31.680]   I'm starting over with a new nation."
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   He doesn't do that.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:40.120]   So even as he goes to the Gentiles, he is hoping that the gospel going to the Gentiles
[00:30:40.120 --> 00:30:41.960]   will provoke them to repentance.
[00:30:41.960 --> 00:30:49.000]   So even as he is judging them, even as he is judging them, he is hoping that that will
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:53.600]   somehow arouse jealousy to bring you to repentance.
[00:30:53.600 --> 00:30:58.280]   Those of you who have been studying through the book of Revelation with us, I mean, that's
[00:30:58.280 --> 00:31:03.760]   the theme over and over again, that we think about Revelation as judgment of God and hell
[00:31:03.760 --> 00:31:09.200]   and fire and disease and pestilence and war and rumors of war.
[00:31:09.200 --> 00:31:13.760]   And all of this is true, but if you pay very close attention to the outline of the book
[00:31:13.760 --> 00:31:19.960]   of Revelation, it's God is using every one of these provocative judgments, hoping that
[00:31:19.960 --> 00:31:26.480]   that will bring to repentance before the final judgment comes.
[00:31:26.480 --> 00:31:27.920]   It isn't simply about the wrath of God.
[00:31:27.920 --> 00:31:33.920]   In fact, intertwined with all these wrath, it's God's grace.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:35.080]   He's still being gracious.
[00:31:35.080 --> 00:31:38.000]   He's still giving time for them to repent.
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:44.440]   And so God is saying, what Paul is saying to the Romans, is that in every way, God is
[00:31:44.440 --> 00:31:46.800]   giving you opportunity.
[00:31:46.800 --> 00:31:54.840]   So in Romans 10, 21, these Gentiles, who I did not give the same opportunity, these Gentiles
[00:31:54.840 --> 00:31:58.800]   that I did not seek, came and sought after me.
[00:31:58.800 --> 00:32:04.960]   But in verse 21, but of Israel, he says, all day long, I have held on my hands to a disobedient
[00:32:04.960 --> 00:32:08.820]   and contrary people.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:11.920]   This whole section is an indictment against the nation of Israel.
[00:32:11.920 --> 00:32:16.360]   He starts out by saying, not all have obeyed the gospel.
[00:32:16.360 --> 00:32:20.440]   And then he concludes by saying, all day long, I've been holding my hands out to them.
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:22.040]   It wasn't because they didn't have opportunity.
[00:32:22.040 --> 00:32:25.280]   It wasn't because they didn't have the prophets.
[00:32:25.280 --> 00:32:29.880]   Even in judgment, he was provoking them to jealousy, and they still would not return.
[00:32:29.880 --> 00:32:32.240]   All day long, I've been holding out my hand.
[00:32:32.240 --> 00:32:37.320]   Not one year, not two years, not 10 years, not 100 years, hundreds and hundreds and hundreds
[00:32:37.320 --> 00:32:40.400]   of years, generation after generation after generation.
[00:32:40.400 --> 00:32:44.080]   God is still persevering with them.
[00:32:44.080 --> 00:32:53.920]   So the natural question that anyone should ask, is God done with Israel?
[00:32:53.920 --> 00:32:57.680]   Has God put them away, and now he says, you know what, that's done with Israel, and now
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:59.800]   let's move on to the Gentiles.
[00:32:59.800 --> 00:33:03.160]   Is he done?
[00:33:03.160 --> 00:33:09.400]   The second part of verse 16, it says, they have not all obeyed the gospel.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:14.020]   For Isaiah says, Lord, who has believed that he has heard from us?
[00:33:14.020 --> 00:33:16.280]   That passage is from Isaiah 53.
[00:33:16.280 --> 00:33:20.920]   How many of you guys know about Isaiah 53?
[00:33:20.920 --> 00:33:26.840]   Isaiah 53 is the clearest presentation of Christ's sacrifice and gospel in the Old Testament.
[00:33:26.840 --> 00:33:32.160]   This is where all like sheep have gone astray, each of us to his own way, but the Lord has
[00:33:32.160 --> 00:33:34.720]   placed on him an iniquity of us all, and you have the whole chapter.
[00:33:34.720 --> 00:33:40.240]   And so a lot of the Jewish people who reject Christianity, they don't read Isaiah 53.
[00:33:40.240 --> 00:33:46.720]   In fact, I have a book of a testimony of a Jewish professor who became a Christian because
[00:33:46.720 --> 00:33:51.720]   he attended a Bible study that was happening to read through Isaiah 53, and he was angered
[00:33:51.720 --> 00:33:54.200]   because he said, you know, I'm a Jew.
[00:33:54.200 --> 00:33:56.040]   Talk about Jesus is offensive to me.
[00:33:56.040 --> 00:33:58.560]   And then he said, we're not reading the New Testament, we're reading your Bible, the Old
[00:33:58.560 --> 00:34:00.000]   Testament.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.880]   So he goes home and he finds out, he grew up a Jew all his life, reads Isaiah 53, and
[00:34:05.880 --> 00:34:07.000]   he comes to repentance.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:11.240]   And I have a book in my office where he gives his testimony about that.
[00:34:11.240 --> 00:34:14.080]   Isaiah 53 is the clearest presentation of the gospel.
[00:34:14.080 --> 00:34:22.040]   And so Paul is reading, or he is stating that passage in Isaiah 53 verse 1, and he begins,
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:26.360]   before he presents the gospel, he says, who will listen?
[00:34:26.360 --> 00:34:31.560]   In other words, the Jews aren't going to listen.
[00:34:31.560 --> 00:34:34.120]   They're not going to listen to this.
[00:34:34.120 --> 00:34:35.760]   And they haven't.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:37.640]   They've shut the door and they refuse to listen.
[00:34:37.640 --> 00:34:44.080]   In fact, many of the synagogues basically exist as if this passage does not exist.
[00:34:44.080 --> 00:34:51.040]   As one of my assignments as a seminary student years ago, my professor asked us to go attend
[00:34:51.040 --> 00:34:53.360]   a Jewish synagogue.
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.400]   So I went to a synagogue in LA with a group of my classmates, and their worship is a bit
[00:34:57.400 --> 00:34:58.400]   different.
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:04.320]   A lot of our worship order came from the first century synagogue order, because that's where
[00:35:04.320 --> 00:35:06.160]   the first Christians came from.
[00:35:06.160 --> 00:35:07.440]   But their worship is a little bit different.
[00:35:07.440 --> 00:35:11.480]   They have a lot more singing, but it's not singing like us.
[00:35:11.480 --> 00:35:15.720]   You know, we sing songs like some artists, you know, wrote lyrics and we try to sing
[00:35:15.720 --> 00:35:20.560]   biblically sound, you know, lyrics and songs, but they actually just sing the Bible.
[00:35:20.560 --> 00:35:26.160]   They will go to the Torah and then the rabbi would come and he would sing verbatim.
[00:35:26.160 --> 00:35:29.680]   And then the congregation would respond and read the next section verbatim.
[00:35:29.680 --> 00:35:32.480]   And then they would just have some intonations back and forth.
[00:35:32.480 --> 00:35:38.000]   And then the Jewish rabbi would come and he would give them maybe a five or six exposition,
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   maybe his devotion.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Then after that, they would go and fellowship and just dance.
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:44.600]   Not a dance party, but like fellowship.
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:47.520]   They would, you know, the way we have fellowship, we're done with worship, they will go out
[00:35:47.520 --> 00:35:48.520]   and fellowship.
[00:35:48.520 --> 00:35:51.960]   But their fellowship is incorporated within their worship, and they would stand in a circle
[00:35:51.960 --> 00:35:55.540]   and just dance, you know, celebrating part of worship.
[00:35:55.540 --> 00:35:59.860]   I thought that was really interesting.
[00:35:59.860 --> 00:36:05.980]   But they will never read this text because it would confuse a lot of Jews.
[00:36:05.980 --> 00:36:13.860]   So Isaiah begins the chapter by saying, who is going to listen to this?
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.800]   They already knew.
[00:36:16.800 --> 00:36:22.260]   God already knew that the Jews were going to harden their heart toward Christ and the
[00:36:22.260 --> 00:36:23.660]   gospel.
[00:36:23.660 --> 00:36:27.320]   And so he quotes that passage, they did not obey the gospel.
[00:36:27.320 --> 00:36:28.480]   Who's going to listen to this?
[00:36:28.480 --> 00:36:30.280]   Is it because they did not hear?
[00:36:30.280 --> 00:36:32.980]   God's been sending out messengers to all the ends of the world.
[00:36:32.980 --> 00:36:35.060]   Is it because they did not understand?
[00:36:35.060 --> 00:36:40.200]   No, he opened the gospel to the Gentiles to provoke them to jealousy.
[00:36:40.200 --> 00:36:46.240]   All day long, he's been holding out his hand toward them, and yet they would not repent.
[00:36:46.240 --> 00:36:50.040]   Then the question is, why?
[00:36:50.040 --> 00:36:57.840]   If God knew, if God knew they were going to harden their hearts, why did he send Isaiah?
[00:36:57.840 --> 00:37:01.840]   Why did he send Ezekiel?
[00:37:01.840 --> 00:37:05.120]   Why did he go to the synagogues?
[00:37:05.120 --> 00:37:07.720]   Why did he send these people?
[00:37:07.720 --> 00:37:14.200]   Why did he endure with them another three, four, five, six, 700 years?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.440]   Isaiah 6, 9 through 12 records Isaiah's calling into ministry.
[00:37:19.440 --> 00:37:23.680]   And you guys know that passage well, where he's confronted by the glory of God.
[00:37:23.680 --> 00:37:26.520]   He falls down, woe is me.
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:30.400]   I'm a man of unclean lips, from a people of unclean lips, and God raises him up and he
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:31.400]   commissions him.
[00:37:31.400 --> 00:37:32.840]   Who will go for me?
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.480]   And Isaiah says, "Here am I, send me."
[00:37:35.480 --> 00:37:41.400]   And then so God commissions him to ministry, and this is his commissioning to ministry.
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:43.080]   And it was always confusing to me.
[00:37:43.080 --> 00:37:50.240]   Like, why would God send and commission Isaiah if he's going to say this?
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:53.240]   And again, I know some of you guys know this passage, Isaiah 6, 9 through 12.
[00:37:53.240 --> 00:37:59.400]   And he said, "Go and say to this people, keep on hearing, but do not understand.
[00:37:59.400 --> 00:38:02.600]   Keep on seeing, but do not perceive.
[00:38:02.600 --> 00:38:06.320]   Make the heart of the people dull and their ears heavy and blind their eyes, lest they
[00:38:06.320 --> 00:38:11.000]   see with their eyes and hear with their ears and understand with their hearts and turn
[00:38:11.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   and be healed."
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:14.240]   Then I said, "How long, O Lord?"
[00:38:14.240 --> 00:38:18.840]   And he said, "Until cities lie waste without inhabitants and houses without people and
[00:38:18.840 --> 00:38:24.880]   the land is desolate waste and the Lord removes people far away and for forsaken places are
[00:38:24.880 --> 00:38:27.600]   many in the midst of the land."
[00:38:27.600 --> 00:38:30.600]   That was Isaiah's calling.
[00:38:30.600 --> 00:38:33.280]   This would weed out the seminary real quick.
[00:38:33.280 --> 00:38:35.240]   "Here my Lord send me."
[00:38:35.240 --> 00:38:37.120]   So, okay, I want you to go for me.
[00:38:37.120 --> 00:38:39.000]   Okay, where do you want me to go?
[00:38:39.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   I want you to go over here.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:44.200]   And they're not going to listen to you.
[00:38:44.200 --> 00:38:45.600]   They're not going to hear you.
[00:38:45.600 --> 00:38:47.720]   They're going to call you a false prophet.
[00:38:47.720 --> 00:38:49.480]   They're going to run you out of town.
[00:38:49.480 --> 00:38:52.480]   Well, how long do you want me to be?
[00:38:52.480 --> 00:38:54.200]   Until judgment comes, they get taken away.
[00:38:54.200 --> 00:38:56.680]   I mean, they never turn?
[00:38:56.680 --> 00:38:57.680]   No.
[00:38:57.680 --> 00:39:02.680]   So, you want me to go and basically you're commissioning me to a group of people who
[00:39:02.680 --> 00:39:09.480]   are already judged and you want me to sacrifice my life, my family, to go and tell people
[00:39:09.480 --> 00:39:10.560]   that aren't going to listen.
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:11.560]   How long?
[00:39:11.560 --> 00:39:15.320]   Until it actually happens.
[00:39:15.320 --> 00:39:17.360]   Why was he even looking for anybody?
[00:39:17.360 --> 00:39:19.520]   Why doesn't he just let them go?
[00:39:19.520 --> 00:39:21.440]   Why does he even tell them?
[00:39:21.440 --> 00:39:23.000]   It's going to happen anyway.
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:28.440]   Why does he even prophesy Isaiah 53 if Israel was not going to receive it and they're going
[00:39:28.440 --> 00:39:29.920]   to reject it?
[00:39:29.920 --> 00:39:37.640]   You know, one of the saddest scenes in Israel's history is described in Ezekiel chapter 8
[00:39:37.640 --> 00:39:43.600]   through 11, is where God's glory begins to leave the temple.
[00:39:43.600 --> 00:39:48.840]   And I think Dr. Harris did such a great job describing this scene of God's glory.
[00:39:48.840 --> 00:39:52.800]   Some of you guys may remember, a few of you may remember, I think it was about 12, 13
[00:39:52.800 --> 00:39:59.400]   years ago he came and he was describing this glory of God and how in Ezekiel up to chapter
[00:39:59.400 --> 00:40:04.720]   8, he describes why judgment is coming upon Israel.
[00:40:04.720 --> 00:40:09.800]   Then after that, he begins to describe the progression of the glory of God leaving.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:15.560]   It's almost kind of like if you read chapter 9, in particular 10 and 11, it almost sounds
[00:40:15.560 --> 00:40:20.760]   like if you've ever moved, you know how you pack your bags and put it in place and then
[00:40:20.760 --> 00:40:23.680]   you're ready and then when you're ready, you pick up your stuff and take it out to the
[00:40:23.680 --> 00:40:25.000]   living room?
[00:40:25.000 --> 00:40:29.320]   And then from the living room, you take it out into the hallway, you know?
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:32.600]   And then from there, you take it downstairs or wherever you need to go, put it up on the
[00:40:32.600 --> 00:40:33.900]   truck.
[00:40:33.900 --> 00:40:38.160]   And that's the kind of scene that you see at the temple where God's glory with the cherubim
[00:40:38.160 --> 00:40:42.440]   and the creatures are basically getting ready and they're fixing to get ready and they go
[00:40:42.440 --> 00:40:46.960]   out to the threshold and then they hover there for a period.
[00:40:46.960 --> 00:40:50.360]   And then from the threshold, they pack up their stuff and then they move out to the
[00:40:50.360 --> 00:40:53.880]   east gate and then they hover there for a period.
[00:40:53.880 --> 00:40:57.200]   And then from the east gate, they move out up to the mountain and they hover there for
[00:40:57.200 --> 00:41:00.200]   a period before he actually departs.
[00:41:00.200 --> 00:41:03.400]   And I think Dr. Harris did such a great job and it was so convicting.
[00:41:03.400 --> 00:41:09.280]   He's almost like somebody who's leaving a home that doesn't want to go.
[00:41:09.280 --> 00:41:15.200]   That God is leaving his temple and his glory among people that he dearly loves.
[00:41:15.200 --> 00:41:19.120]   And he's packing his stuff up and he's at the threshold.
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.520]   It's almost like God is sighing and waiting.
[00:41:22.520 --> 00:41:26.700]   That even then, if they would just repent.
[00:41:26.700 --> 00:41:30.400]   And then the creatures in the glory of God and the cherubim move out to the east gate
[00:41:30.400 --> 00:41:34.640]   and they sigh and they wait for a period.
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:38.960]   Almost kind of like, even then, if they would just repent.
[00:41:38.960 --> 00:41:42.440]   And then he doesn't just take off, he would go out and he would hover over the mountain
[00:41:42.440 --> 00:41:47.520]   for a period looking over the temple in the nation of Israel.
[00:41:47.520 --> 00:41:54.780]   And Dr. Harris described the scene as God reluctantly leaving Israel.
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:42:01.100]   So the question, the natural question that we ask is, is God done?
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:02.740]   Is God done with Israel?
[00:42:02.740 --> 00:42:06.660]   And that's exactly what Ezekiel asked in Ezekiel 11, 13.
[00:42:06.660 --> 00:42:12.020]   "Our Lord God, will you make a full end of the remnant of Israel?
[00:42:12.020 --> 00:42:18.220]   Now that the glory of God has departed, are you done with Israel?"
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:21.940]   And God answers him in verse 16 and 17 of Ezekiel 11.
[00:42:21.940 --> 00:42:26.420]   He says, "Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord God, though I removed them far off among the
[00:42:26.420 --> 00:42:31.900]   nations and though I scattered them among the countries, yet I have been a sanctuary
[00:42:31.900 --> 00:42:36.300]   to them for a while in the countries where they have gone.
[00:42:36.300 --> 00:42:40.020]   Therefore say, 'Thus says the Lord God, I will gather you from the peoples and assemble
[00:42:40.020 --> 00:42:44.360]   you out of the countries where you have been scattered, and I will give you the land of
[00:42:44.360 --> 00:42:46.860]   Israel.'"
[00:42:46.860 --> 00:42:53.720]   Even as he is leaving, even as he is packing up, reluctantly going after sending hundreds
[00:42:53.720 --> 00:42:58.400]   and hundreds of years of prophets to get them to return, even as they stone them and chase
[00:42:58.400 --> 00:43:07.780]   them out of the city, and as they are going into captivity, Ezekiel asks, "Is this it?
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:10.960]   All that you have done for us, is this the end?
[00:43:10.960 --> 00:43:15.900]   Will your glory leave us forever?"
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:24.120]   The simple answer is, "No, I'm not done.
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:26.140]   I'm not done with them."
[00:43:26.140 --> 00:43:30.660]   And that's the question that is asked in Romans chapter 11, the very next chapter.
[00:43:30.660 --> 00:43:34.600]   Ask then, "Has God rejected the people?
[00:43:34.600 --> 00:43:37.080]   Has God rejected Israel?
[00:43:37.080 --> 00:43:41.280]   If this is what happened with Israel, if God has opened the door to the Gentiles, is he
[00:43:41.280 --> 00:43:42.880]   done with Israel?"
[00:43:42.880 --> 00:43:52.600]   And the answer is an emphatic, "By no means, by no means."
[00:43:52.600 --> 00:43:54.920]   Romans 11, 11 and 12.
[00:43:54.920 --> 00:43:59.720]   I asked them, "Did they stumble in order that they might fall?
[00:43:59.720 --> 00:44:01.720]   By no means.
[00:44:01.720 --> 00:44:06.560]   Rather through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles, so as to make Israel
[00:44:06.560 --> 00:44:08.600]   jealous.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:13.960]   Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for
[00:44:13.960 --> 00:44:21.320]   the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean?"
[00:44:21.320 --> 00:44:26.520]   I want you to take a minute to think about what this is saying.
[00:44:26.520 --> 00:44:34.600]   If their fall means salvation for the Gentiles, if they have become poor so that the Gentiles
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:41.600]   become rich, and God did all of this to provoke them to jealousy, what would it mean when
[00:44:41.600 --> 00:44:46.840]   Israel repents?
[00:44:46.840 --> 00:44:51.520]   You know what he's saying?
[00:44:51.520 --> 00:44:55.400]   God has not forsaken his people.
[00:44:55.400 --> 00:45:00.280]   As he rejoices over the Gentiles coming into his kingdom, if he rejoices and celebrates
[00:45:00.280 --> 00:45:05.040]   for every soul that repents and comes into the kingdom, what kind of celebration will
[00:45:05.040 --> 00:45:15.960]   there be in heaven when Israel that he loved for centuries after centuries, sent his prophets,
[00:45:15.960 --> 00:45:22.080]   that only God was sent as a Jew, what would it mean when they repent?
[00:45:22.080 --> 00:45:27.120]   It's an expression of his love to these people.
[00:45:27.120 --> 00:45:35.920]   I don't know about you, I don't know about you, but has anybody ever pursued you like
[00:45:35.920 --> 00:45:38.640]   that?
[00:45:38.640 --> 00:45:41.520]   Maybe some of you guys have boyfriends who went out of their way, maybe they're romantic
[00:45:41.520 --> 00:45:46.200]   and they just, you know, bent over backwards, "Oh my gosh, I'm so touched," and you're
[00:45:46.200 --> 00:45:47.200]   in tears.
[00:45:47.200 --> 00:45:52.360]   Has anybody pursued you like that?
[00:45:52.360 --> 00:45:56.320]   Anybody loved you like that?
[00:45:56.320 --> 00:46:01.400]   Anybody been patient with you like that?
[00:46:01.400 --> 00:46:06.680]   Anybody stayed with you like that?
[00:46:06.680 --> 00:46:15.400]   Even in the indictment against the nation of Israel, over and over again, why wouldn't
[00:46:15.400 --> 00:46:18.080]   you be done?
[00:46:18.080 --> 00:46:21.540]   Why are we even having this discussion?
[00:46:21.540 --> 00:46:26.360]   Why wouldn't they, why wouldn't he have been done with Ezekiel's prophecy?
[00:46:26.360 --> 00:46:29.320]   Why wouldn't he have been done with Hosea's prophecies?
[00:46:29.320 --> 00:46:34.800]   Why wouldn't he have been done with Jeremiah's prophecies or Isaiah's or Daniel's?
[00:46:34.800 --> 00:46:38.240]   Why are we having this conversation again?
[00:46:38.240 --> 00:46:44.320]   Even after Jesus came himself, stood before them, and even after, not only the prophets
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:50.880]   but the Son of God that they crucified, even then, you would think if God was patient by
[00:46:50.880 --> 00:47:00.280]   killing the prophets, even after you killed his only begotten Son, you must be done now.
[00:47:00.280 --> 00:47:04.240]   It must have finally, I mean, even God, you must have a patience that must run out at
[00:47:04.240 --> 00:47:09.240]   some point, and you would think that if it was going to run out, it would be with them
[00:47:09.240 --> 00:47:16.180]   crucifying your son, or you're done with Israel, and he doesn't just say, "I don't think so."
[00:47:16.180 --> 00:47:19.920]   He doesn't just say, "Maybe," or "Possibly."
[00:47:19.920 --> 00:47:29.440]   He says, "No, by no means, not even close."
[00:47:29.440 --> 00:47:32.160]   God's going to restore them.
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:37.840]   Hebrews chapter 1, 1 and 2, "Long ago, at many times and in many ways, God spoke to
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:44.000]   our fathers by the prophets, but in these last days, he has spoken to us by his Son,
[00:47:44.000 --> 00:47:51.840]   whom he appointed the heir of all things, through whom also he created the world.
[00:47:51.840 --> 00:47:58.400]   As long as it is called today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts as in
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:00.540]   the rebellion.
[00:48:00.540 --> 00:48:06.160]   As long as God is gracious, as long as God speaks, as long as your ears are open, your
[00:48:06.160 --> 00:48:12.020]   hearts are soft, do not turn away from the Lord.
[00:48:12.020 --> 00:48:16.700]   As he was patient with Israel, God is patient with us."
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:22.420]   I want to encourage you.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:27.660]   Maybe some of you guys have been drifting away from God for so long, there's no feeling
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:32.940]   in your heart, you don't remember when you first came to Christ.
[00:48:32.940 --> 00:48:36.140]   Maybe you've been living and deliberately hardened your heart for so long because you
[00:48:36.140 --> 00:48:41.620]   didn't want to be obedient, and you've hardened your heart and hardened your heart and hardened
[00:48:41.620 --> 00:48:48.020]   your heart, and yet God is still talking to you.
[00:48:48.020 --> 00:48:51.100]   God is still patient with you.
[00:48:51.100 --> 00:48:56.780]   As long as it is called today, as long as your repentance is genuine, as long as you
[00:48:56.780 --> 00:49:02.940]   cry out to God in sincerity, if you confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive
[00:49:02.940 --> 00:49:05.900]   us all our unrighteousness.
[00:49:05.900 --> 00:49:11.860]   I pray that every single one of us would recognize what it is that we have in Christ, that we
[00:49:11.860 --> 00:49:16.700]   may enter the throne of grace with confidence by the blood of Christ.
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:20.820]   Will you take some time to pray with me as I invite the worship team to come?
[00:49:20.820 --> 00:49:26.060]   Amen.
