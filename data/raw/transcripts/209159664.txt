[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.980]   [INAUDIBLE]
[00:00:12.980 --> 00:00:16.960]   It says, "Therefore, in Christ have suffered in the flesh.
[00:00:16.960 --> 00:00:19.440]   Arm yourself also with the same purpose,
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:23.420]   because he who has suffered in the flesh has peed from sin.
[00:00:23.420 --> 00:00:25.900]   So as to live the rest of the time in the flesh
[00:00:25.900 --> 00:00:29.420]   no longer for the love of men, but for the will of God.
[00:00:29.420 --> 00:00:32.300]   For the time already past is sufficient for you
[00:00:32.300 --> 00:00:34.500]   to have carried out the desire of the Gentiles,
[00:00:34.500 --> 00:00:39.100]   having pursued a course of sensuality, lust, drunkenness,
[00:00:39.100 --> 00:00:43.060]   carousing, drinking parties, and abominable idolatry.
[00:00:43.060 --> 00:00:45.740]   In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them
[00:00:45.740 --> 00:00:49.860]   into the same excess of dissipation, and they malign you.
[00:00:49.860 --> 00:00:51.360]   But they will give an account to him
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:54.220]   who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[00:00:54.220 --> 00:00:56.300]   For the gospel has, for this purpose,
[00:00:56.300 --> 00:00:59.260]   been preached even to those who are dead,
[00:00:59.260 --> 00:01:01.980]   as though they are judged in the flesh, as men,
[00:01:01.980 --> 00:01:05.620]   they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.
[00:01:05.620 --> 00:01:07.300]   The end of all things is near.
[00:01:07.300 --> 00:01:10.820]   Therefore, be sound of judgment and sober of spirit
[00:01:10.820 --> 00:01:12.460]   for the purpose of prayer.
[00:01:12.460 --> 00:01:15.780]   Above all, be fervent in your love for one another,
[00:01:15.780 --> 00:01:18.900]   because love covers a multitude of sins.
[00:01:18.900 --> 00:01:21.700]   Be hospitable to one another without complaint,
[00:01:21.700 --> 00:01:24.460]   as each one has received a special gift,
[00:01:24.460 --> 00:01:26.980]   employed in serving one another as good stewards
[00:01:26.980 --> 00:01:29.420]   of the manifold grace of God.
[00:01:29.420 --> 00:01:31.340]   Whoever speaks is to do so as one
[00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:33.780]   who is speaking the utterance of God.
[00:01:33.780 --> 00:01:35.900]   Whoever serves is to do so as one
[00:01:35.900 --> 00:01:39.380]   who is serving by the strength which God supplies,
[00:01:39.380 --> 00:01:42.100]   so that in all things God may be glorified
[00:01:42.100 --> 00:01:45.300]   through Jesus Christ, to whom belongs the glory
[00:01:45.300 --> 00:01:47.620]   and dominion forever and ever.
[00:01:47.620 --> 00:01:48.460]   Amen.
[00:01:48.460 --> 00:01:50.140]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:01:50.140 --> 00:01:54.420]   Father, we ask again that you would
[00:01:54.420 --> 00:01:57.460]   grant us insight into your word.
[00:01:57.460 --> 00:02:02.460]   Lord, I pray that as we study, as we die,
[00:02:02.460 --> 00:02:07.180]   as we are sick, more and more it would inspire
[00:02:07.180 --> 00:02:10.140]   a hunger in our hearts to live a life
[00:02:10.140 --> 00:02:13.620]   that is consumed with you, to live a life
[00:02:13.620 --> 00:02:16.140]   that's healing to you, to ultimately live
[00:02:16.140 --> 00:02:17.340]   a life that's glorified.
[00:02:17.340 --> 00:02:21.660]   And so I ask God that we would give special attention
[00:02:21.660 --> 00:02:23.900]   whenever your word is opened to us.
[00:02:23.900 --> 00:02:27.660]   And Lord, I ask that you would also, by your Spirit,
[00:02:27.660 --> 00:02:30.700]   soften our hearts so that if there's any resistance,
[00:02:30.700 --> 00:02:32.940]   if there's any ulterior motive,
[00:02:32.940 --> 00:02:34.660]   that I could put those things aside.
[00:02:34.660 --> 00:02:36.780]   Lord, we thank you, thank you, I thank you, thank you.
[00:02:36.780 --> 00:02:38.100]   Amen.
[00:02:38.100 --> 00:02:38.940]   Amen.
[00:02:38.940 --> 00:02:44.820]   Well, the last time that we studied
[00:02:44.820 --> 00:02:49.100]   the previous section, we've been talking
[00:02:49.100 --> 00:02:51.740]   so much about suffering throughout
[00:02:51.740 --> 00:02:54.420]   the Book of First Peter, and the admonition
[00:02:54.420 --> 00:02:57.660]   continues to mount in terms of how we're supposed
[00:02:57.660 --> 00:02:59.660]   to deal with that suffering.
[00:02:59.660 --> 00:03:01.940]   And some sections of the passage, or the book,
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:03.420]   are gonna sound similar as we try
[00:03:03.420 --> 00:03:04.820]   to take it tongue by tongue.
[00:03:04.820 --> 00:03:07.700]   As I was talking about that, I mentioned
[00:03:07.700 --> 00:03:10.700]   how for us in our day, perhaps there are
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:12.700]   some unique applications, or at least
[00:03:12.700 --> 00:03:15.260]   an exhortation that we should hear.
[00:03:15.260 --> 00:03:18.820]   And I began by exhorting us that we should be thankful.
[00:03:20.460 --> 00:03:22.460]   I mean, it is truly a grace of God
[00:03:22.460 --> 00:03:25.620]   that we can have peace, that there's a sense
[00:03:25.620 --> 00:03:27.700]   in which we don't have to be living in fear
[00:03:27.700 --> 00:03:30.300]   because we live in fear, that we don't have
[00:03:30.300 --> 00:03:33.380]   to be in threat because we carry our Bible.
[00:03:33.380 --> 00:03:35.500]   There is a thankfulness that we should have
[00:03:35.500 --> 00:03:37.980]   because of the blessings, even just physically,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:39.220]   even daily, that we have.
[00:03:39.220 --> 00:03:43.380]   We also mentioned that we should be prepared.
[00:03:43.380 --> 00:03:45.860]   These are just a blink for you in the introduction.
[00:03:45.860 --> 00:03:48.900]   Let's be thankful, let's be prepared.
[00:03:48.900 --> 00:03:53.060]   I said that Christ has given us the expectation.
[00:03:53.060 --> 00:03:56.860]   If you desire to live Godly, you will come.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:04:00.380]   It's not a matter of if, it's a matter of when.
[00:04:00.380 --> 00:04:03.060]   That suffering will come, heartache will come
[00:04:03.060 --> 00:04:05.060]   because you call on the name of the Lord.
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:09.780]   And what's more, it was Peter who said,
[00:04:09.780 --> 00:04:11.660]   Jesus left an example to follow,
[00:04:11.660 --> 00:04:14.900]   so if you are a disciple of his, guess what?
[00:04:14.900 --> 00:04:16.500]   Just as they treated the master,
[00:04:16.500 --> 00:04:19.660]   we too are going to be persecuted.
[00:04:19.660 --> 00:04:23.380]   But the last one, I said, let's also
[00:04:23.380 --> 00:04:25.660]   take on the burden of others,
[00:04:25.660 --> 00:04:29.100]   take on the burden of others.
[00:04:29.100 --> 00:04:31.140]   And I think for a moment about the people
[00:04:31.140 --> 00:04:35.900]   who in our lives, the people in our lives
[00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:40.180]   who experience hardship so that you and I
[00:04:40.180 --> 00:04:42.780]   don't have to go through it, namely our parents.
[00:04:44.580 --> 00:04:48.140]   We think about parents who really just toiled,
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:50.500]   labored, and suffered so that their children
[00:04:50.500 --> 00:04:51.500]   could have a what?
[00:04:51.500 --> 00:04:52.340]   A better life.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:04:55.820]   People who, if you're from an immigrant family,
[00:04:55.820 --> 00:04:57.260]   people who would risk it all,
[00:04:57.260 --> 00:04:59.420]   let go of everything they're comfortable with
[00:04:59.420 --> 00:05:01.060]   or let go of everything that they know
[00:05:01.060 --> 00:05:03.980]   in terms of their world, risk it all to move
[00:05:03.980 --> 00:05:07.340]   in hope of a better life for their next generation.
[00:05:07.340 --> 00:05:09.420]   Because assuredly, it wasn't their own generation
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:11.940]   that would see the benefit of that move,
[00:05:11.940 --> 00:05:13.340]   it's for the next generation.
[00:05:14.180 --> 00:05:16.100]   And so we think about these individuals
[00:05:16.100 --> 00:05:18.820]   who would go through suffering so that we
[00:05:18.820 --> 00:05:19.820]   could have it easy.
[00:05:19.820 --> 00:05:22.180]   This is pretty much the great example
[00:05:22.180 --> 00:05:24.380]   that Christ offers us of all.
[00:05:24.380 --> 00:05:27.860]   That Christ suffered in place of.
[00:05:27.860 --> 00:05:31.660]   He suffered with a purpose and intention in his heart
[00:05:31.660 --> 00:05:33.740]   so that we would not have to experience
[00:05:33.740 --> 00:05:36.780]   that kind of shame, that kind of ridicule,
[00:05:36.780 --> 00:05:38.140]   that kind of separation.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:41.340]   The hardship that he knew would come
[00:05:41.340 --> 00:05:44.900]   because of our sin, he was in his good pleasure
[00:05:44.900 --> 00:05:47.220]   and it was his volition to say,
[00:05:47.220 --> 00:05:50.380]   I will bear that and you will be happy.
[00:05:50.380 --> 00:05:52.500]   And so the exhortation for us is,
[00:05:52.500 --> 00:05:55.700]   let's take the burden of someone else's
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:59.100]   spiritual well-being, let's take the burden
[00:05:59.100 --> 00:06:02.580]   and responsibility of someone else's hardship
[00:06:02.580 --> 00:06:05.060]   or whatever it may be so that they would do well.
[00:06:05.060 --> 00:06:07.780]   That's something quite inspiring.
[00:06:07.780 --> 00:06:10.940]   And so today's challenge is going to be
[00:06:10.940 --> 00:06:12.980]   in line with that thought by saying
[00:06:12.980 --> 00:06:18.700]   that we hope to make our lives as intentional
[00:06:18.700 --> 00:06:19.900]   as a suffering distress.
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:25.740]   As Christ, his time on earth was incredibly focused.
[00:06:25.740 --> 00:06:29.820]   His time on earth had a goal so crystal clear.
[00:06:29.820 --> 00:06:35.140]   There was a decree of God, there was a command of God,
[00:06:35.140 --> 00:06:37.860]   there was a purpose of God that Jesus Christ
[00:06:37.860 --> 00:06:40.100]   was fulfilling as he went on earth.
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:43.420]   And then on a narrow scale, Christ's suffering
[00:06:43.420 --> 00:06:44.580]   and guilt took off.
[00:06:44.580 --> 00:06:50.020]   So it was not haphazard, it wasn't on the spur
[00:06:50.020 --> 00:06:52.700]   of the moment, we learned that it was well-planned,
[00:06:52.700 --> 00:06:56.740]   executed and it was so intentional and we
[00:06:56.740 --> 00:06:58.300]   want to make our lives that way.
[00:06:58.300 --> 00:07:03.300]   So let's break down the passage
[00:07:03.300 --> 00:07:04.940]   and start walking through it.
[00:07:04.940 --> 00:07:06.940]   That was all introduction.
[00:07:06.940 --> 00:07:11.100]   Verse one, he says, if you notice kind of the way
[00:07:11.100 --> 00:07:13.540]   I put it, I reorganize it a little bit
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:15.740]   for the sake of context, right?
[00:07:15.740 --> 00:07:19.940]   I just put, therefore, arm yourself also
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:23.580]   with the same purpose since Christ has suffered
[00:07:23.580 --> 00:07:27.020]   in the flesh because he who has suffered in the flesh
[00:07:27.020 --> 00:07:28.620]   has been crucified.
[00:07:28.620 --> 00:07:31.700]   So in my outlining, I'm trying to show you
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:33.620]   like how I outline the passage.
[00:07:33.620 --> 00:07:35.860]   Sometimes if I see that it begins
[00:07:35.860 --> 00:07:38.900]   with this causation, a sense of this,
[00:07:38.900 --> 00:07:42.340]   therefore do that, you can just follow that flow.
[00:07:42.340 --> 00:07:45.860]   But if there's a list of other causes or purposes
[00:07:45.860 --> 00:07:48.100]   or whatever it may be, sometimes I kind of move it
[00:07:48.100 --> 00:07:49.620]   just for the sake of me understanding
[00:07:49.620 --> 00:07:51.980]   the suppression of thought, okay?
[00:07:51.980 --> 00:07:53.740]   So that's what I did there, it begins again
[00:07:53.740 --> 00:07:58.740]   with therefore, arm yourself also with the same purpose.
[00:07:58.740 --> 00:08:00.100]   Now I ask you a question.
[00:08:00.100 --> 00:08:04.500]   He's commanding us to have this purpose.
[00:08:04.500 --> 00:08:06.260]   What is that purpose?
[00:08:06.260 --> 00:08:10.100]   Take a moment to think about it.
[00:08:10.100 --> 00:08:12.580]   What is this purpose that he's talking about?
[00:08:12.580 --> 00:08:15.740]   As you think about it, that word purpose
[00:08:15.740 --> 00:08:19.260]   in the Greek kind of has a broad definition.
[00:08:19.260 --> 00:08:20.980]   In this context, it is, I think,
[00:08:20.980 --> 00:08:23.380]   best translated, yes, purpose.
[00:08:23.380 --> 00:08:26.500]   But the whole idea behind it is contention, right?
[00:08:26.500 --> 00:08:28.660]   There is this goal and ambition.
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.380]   The reason why I say that is because this same word
[00:08:30.380 --> 00:08:32.900]   is used in Hebrews chapter four, verse 12.
[00:08:32.900 --> 00:08:35.060]   Remember, that's the passage about the word of God
[00:08:35.060 --> 00:08:37.500]   is proper than a double-edged sword.
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:41.740]   It's able to judge the thoughts and intentions of the heart.
[00:08:41.740 --> 00:08:45.540]   But here, the same word is translated
[00:08:45.540 --> 00:08:47.580]   as intention in Hebrews.
[00:08:47.580 --> 00:08:50.620]   So the idea here is arm yourself with the same intention,
[00:08:50.620 --> 00:08:53.580]   and that's why I made this general introductory
[00:08:53.580 --> 00:08:56.820]   kind of purpose statement for the whole lesson is
[00:08:56.820 --> 00:08:58.420]   we want to have this intentionality,
[00:08:58.420 --> 00:09:00.100]   same attitude of question.
[00:09:00.100 --> 00:09:04.260]   And going back to the question, what is that purpose?
[00:09:04.260 --> 00:09:09.380]   Well, since this is connected to the previous passage,
[00:09:09.380 --> 00:09:11.820]   let's roll our eyes over and see.
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.620]   If you look over in chapter three, verse 17 through 18,
[00:09:14.620 --> 00:09:20.780]   it began by him saying, "For it is better if God
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:23.340]   "could will it so that you suffer for doing what is right
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:25.540]   "rather than for doing what is wrong."
[00:09:25.540 --> 00:09:28.340]   That much, we've repeated now many times.
[00:09:28.340 --> 00:09:30.900]   If you're gonna suffer, don't suffer for injustice,
[00:09:30.900 --> 00:09:32.300]   suffer for the cause of Christ,
[00:09:32.300 --> 00:09:34.500]   suffer for righteousness, right?
[00:09:34.500 --> 00:09:39.140]   But then he adds, "For Christ also died for sin
[00:09:39.140 --> 00:09:41.860]   "once for all to just for the unjust,
[00:09:41.860 --> 00:09:43.500]   "so that he might bring us to God,
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:46.140]   "having them put to death in the flesh,
[00:09:46.140 --> 00:09:48.460]   "but made alive in this world."
[00:09:48.460 --> 00:09:52.340]   So the case example of Christ is that this,
[00:09:52.340 --> 00:09:55.700]   you know, the Savior who died for the unjust,
[00:09:55.700 --> 00:09:57.900]   he would put to death in the flesh.
[00:09:57.900 --> 00:10:00.780]   So notice that when he's telling us
[00:10:00.780 --> 00:10:02.460]   to have this same purpose,
[00:10:02.460 --> 00:10:03.860]   he's drawing back to the idea
[00:10:03.860 --> 00:10:06.300]   that Christ would put the death in the flesh.
[00:10:06.300 --> 00:10:08.300]   And so when he's calling the church here,
[00:10:08.300 --> 00:10:09.780]   or the people who are scattered,
[00:10:09.780 --> 00:10:12.460]   the original audience that they need to also suffer
[00:10:12.460 --> 00:10:13.900]   and have this same purpose,
[00:10:13.900 --> 00:10:17.860]   it is inclusive more than just saying,
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.820]   "Hey, just like Jesus did, let's go get 'em."
[00:10:20.820 --> 00:10:26.340]   It's actually what I'm saying is inclusive of the idea.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:30.180]   There is a purpose where he is willing to die.
[00:10:30.180 --> 00:10:35.700]   On a cursory reading, I don't know if we've passed that,
[00:10:35.700 --> 00:10:39.780]   but there is a willingness to lay down his life
[00:10:39.780 --> 00:10:41.020]   for the unjust.
[00:10:41.020 --> 00:10:43.140]   There is a willingness to go all the way
[00:10:43.140 --> 00:10:45.860]   through the process of what God has ordained
[00:10:45.860 --> 00:10:47.260]   to the point of what?
[00:10:47.260 --> 00:10:48.820]   Death on the cross.
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.300]   And so if you remember,
[00:10:51.300 --> 00:10:54.020]   when it talks about Jesus Christ in Hebrews,
[00:10:54.020 --> 00:10:56.420]   it says in chapter 12, verse two,
[00:10:56.420 --> 00:10:59.900]   "Fixing our eyes on Jesus, the author and perfecter of faith,
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:03.180]   "who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:11:03.180 --> 00:11:06.540]   "despising the shame, and has sat down at the right hand
[00:11:06.540 --> 00:11:08.060]   "of the throne of God."
[00:11:08.060 --> 00:11:11.700]   But you can see, what was the purpose of God
[00:11:11.700 --> 00:11:13.700]   that we are to take upon for ourselves?
[00:11:13.700 --> 00:11:18.980]   The purpose of God was to lay down his entire life.
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:22.740]   So before I just simply read like,
[00:11:22.740 --> 00:11:24.220]   "Hey, arm yourself with this crisis,"
[00:11:24.220 --> 00:11:25.700]   I wanted to get that across.
[00:11:25.700 --> 00:11:29.700]   At the extent and intentionality of Christ,
[00:11:29.700 --> 00:11:33.740]   when he came, he said, "I came for this."
[00:11:33.740 --> 00:11:36.860]   Do you remember when Christ was at the Garden of Gethsemane
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:38.060]   wrestling?
[00:11:38.060 --> 00:11:40.900]   Do you remember when he would predict to his disciples,
[00:11:40.900 --> 00:11:43.180]   "The Son of Man needs to suffer."
[00:11:43.180 --> 00:11:44.220]   And when his disciples were like,
[00:11:44.220 --> 00:11:46.140]   "No, you're not suffering, you're a Messiah,
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.380]   "and we're gonna make you king."
[00:11:48.380 --> 00:11:50.100]   What would he say?
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:52.780]   "Did I not come for this?
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:55.020]   "Did I pass by what God has written?"
[00:11:55.020 --> 00:11:59.340]   He set his face like stone to the cross
[00:11:59.340 --> 00:12:02.100]   of who was intentioned to that end.
[00:12:02.100 --> 00:12:05.380]   So when this passage teaches us to arm yourself,
[00:12:05.380 --> 00:12:09.780]   the command here is to say,
[00:12:09.780 --> 00:12:12.780]   "Be prepared to die in battle."
[00:12:12.780 --> 00:12:16.580]   Be prepared to go all the way.
[00:12:16.580 --> 00:12:19.700]   The purpose and intentionality for us
[00:12:19.700 --> 00:12:21.900]   when it comes to following Christ,
[00:12:21.900 --> 00:12:24.580]   for us to do his will,
[00:12:24.580 --> 00:12:26.620]   for us to love as Christ loved,
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:29.580]   for us to proclaim the excellency,
[00:12:29.580 --> 00:12:31.500]   going all the way to the point
[00:12:31.500 --> 00:12:36.180]   where we would lay down our lives.
[00:12:36.180 --> 00:12:37.660]   Why do I say that?
[00:12:37.660 --> 00:12:40.380]   Because even the command, the command word,
[00:12:40.380 --> 00:12:41.780]   is "arm yourself."
[00:12:41.780 --> 00:12:45.300]   That's the key verb of the whole paragraph.
[00:12:45.300 --> 00:12:48.900]   But this word is a military word
[00:12:48.900 --> 00:12:51.060]   where the noun form of that verb
[00:12:51.060 --> 00:12:52.300]   literally means "weapon."
[00:12:52.300 --> 00:12:56.260]   So the idea is to be preparing
[00:12:56.260 --> 00:12:58.020]   by putting on the battle gear
[00:12:58.020 --> 00:12:59.460]   and taking up the weapon,
[00:12:59.460 --> 00:13:04.620]   to be saying, "Be that which is intent and purpose
[00:13:04.620 --> 00:13:06.660]   "to go all the way."
[00:13:06.660 --> 00:13:09.460]   Now, in this passage,
[00:13:09.460 --> 00:13:11.580]   when you think about that,
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.500]   this would be hard, right?
[00:13:13.500 --> 00:13:15.300]   This would be kind of hard to accept,
[00:13:15.300 --> 00:13:18.100]   you know, in any other context
[00:13:18.100 --> 00:13:19.660]   for us to think from a natural way,
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:21.540]   like if, let's say, an unbeliever
[00:13:21.540 --> 00:13:24.100]   was coming here and listening to me speak right now,
[00:13:24.100 --> 00:13:26.260]   and if you imagine, they're kind of like,
[00:13:26.260 --> 00:13:27.100]   "What?
[00:13:27.100 --> 00:13:28.740]   "He's talking about let's get ready to die?
[00:13:28.740 --> 00:13:30.540]   "Let's go all the way?
[00:13:30.540 --> 00:13:31.380]   "What is this?"
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:32.660]   You know?
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:33.820]   Now, there's a sense in which
[00:13:33.820 --> 00:13:36.500]   this would be very hard to accept.
[00:13:36.500 --> 00:13:38.460]   But remember, the immediate context
[00:13:38.460 --> 00:13:39.540]   that he's speaking to,
[00:13:39.540 --> 00:13:41.980]   this is a very near and close reality.
[00:13:41.980 --> 00:13:45.940]   This is a very close and near reality.
[00:13:47.220 --> 00:13:49.220]   Now, we ask this question,
[00:13:49.220 --> 00:13:51.460]   why?
[00:13:51.460 --> 00:13:54.580]   The command is clear now,
[00:13:54.580 --> 00:13:57.380]   arm yourself with the sword, right?
[00:13:57.380 --> 00:13:59.180]   But when you look at the passage,
[00:13:59.180 --> 00:14:00.780]   there are several reasons why.
[00:14:00.780 --> 00:14:02.860]   Let's run down a few.
[00:14:02.860 --> 00:14:05.020]   First,
[00:14:05.020 --> 00:14:08.500]   the first is very clear.
[00:14:08.500 --> 00:14:11.660]   It says, "Since Christ died for you," right?
[00:14:11.660 --> 00:14:13.060]   Since Christ has died in the flesh,
[00:14:13.060 --> 00:14:14.100]   or suffered in the flesh,
[00:14:14.100 --> 00:14:15.540]   and using those two terms
[00:14:15.540 --> 00:14:17.620]   synonymously here,
[00:14:17.620 --> 00:14:19.940]   and if you have your NASD Bible
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:21.380]   and you see that little subscript
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:23.380]   or the superscript of one,
[00:14:23.380 --> 00:14:25.340]   it'll say on the side,
[00:14:25.340 --> 00:14:28.460]   suffered to death or suffered to death there.
[00:14:28.460 --> 00:14:30.460]   Because of the example set by Christ,
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:32.380]   because we were called for this purpose
[00:14:32.380 --> 00:14:33.500]   that Christ has laid,
[00:14:33.500 --> 00:14:35.660]   that we would, in this life,
[00:14:35.660 --> 00:14:37.660]   suffer in resemblance to him.
[00:14:37.660 --> 00:14:40.260]   We need to arm ourselves then
[00:14:40.260 --> 00:14:41.740]   with that purpose and call.
[00:14:41.740 --> 00:14:44.420]   But secondly,
[00:14:44.420 --> 00:14:45.860]   here's an interesting rationale
[00:14:45.860 --> 00:14:47.940]   that Apostle Peter gives.
[00:14:47.940 --> 00:14:49.340]   He says,
[00:14:49.340 --> 00:14:52.700]   on top of sin, Christ has suffered in the flesh,
[00:14:52.700 --> 00:14:55.580]   he says, "Because you who have suffered in the flesh
[00:14:55.580 --> 00:14:56.940]   "have seeped from sin."
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:14:59.460]   You who have suffered in the flesh
[00:14:59.460 --> 00:15:01.260]   have seeped from sin.
[00:15:01.260 --> 00:15:04.540]   So, what does that mean in that section?
[00:15:04.540 --> 00:15:09.540]   How does suffering and seeping from sin connect?
[00:15:09.540 --> 00:15:12.300]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:15:13.700 --> 00:15:14.860]   And I wanna remind us,
[00:15:14.860 --> 00:15:17.740]   the rationale for a Christian,
[00:15:17.740 --> 00:15:23.100]   when can you be truly free from sin?
[00:15:23.100 --> 00:15:27.820]   When you die.
[00:15:27.820 --> 00:15:32.260]   The worst that can happen to a Christian in persecution
[00:15:32.260 --> 00:15:35.100]   is people can begin by ridiculing you,
[00:15:35.100 --> 00:15:36.900]   people can begin by mocking you,
[00:15:36.900 --> 00:15:38.460]   "Why don't you run with us?"
[00:15:38.460 --> 00:15:40.660]   And then they'll hurt you, slander you,
[00:15:40.660 --> 00:15:42.220]   but the ultimate thing they could do to you,
[00:15:42.220 --> 00:15:43.340]   especially in this context,
[00:15:43.340 --> 00:15:45.740]   is they could put you to death because of your faith.
[00:15:45.740 --> 00:15:46.860]   But for the Christian,
[00:15:46.860 --> 00:15:49.780]   that death is what?
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:52.420]   The Jesus.
[00:15:52.420 --> 00:15:57.100]   You know, when I was in seminary,
[00:15:57.100 --> 00:16:00.140]   it took me a little long actually to graduate,
[00:16:00.140 --> 00:16:02.740]   like four years into it was more than that.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:04.580]   And all four years,
[00:16:04.580 --> 00:16:06.660]   I would always visit the student life hall
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:08.260]   in the study hall area,
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:09.340]   and there was this man,
[00:16:09.340 --> 00:16:10.180]   he was in the sauna,
[00:16:10.180 --> 00:16:11.380]   he kept rebutting me,
[00:16:11.500 --> 00:16:13.940]   because he always hung out with me.
[00:16:13.940 --> 00:16:15.900]   He always hung out with me.
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:17.340]   And this guy, everybody knew him
[00:16:17.340 --> 00:16:20.180]   because he has the most greatest personality ever.
[00:16:20.180 --> 00:16:23.100]   Unfortunately, from birth,
[00:16:23.100 --> 00:16:25.220]   he was paralyzed from the inside out.
[00:16:25.220 --> 00:16:27.620]   And his teeth were all slurred,
[00:16:27.620 --> 00:16:30.060]   and he really couldn't make out words very well.
[00:16:30.060 --> 00:16:33.260]   You could tell the man had just a lot of disabilities,
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.460]   even above and beyond what you just imagined.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:38.300]   The first time I met him,
[00:16:38.300 --> 00:16:41.500]   I met him because he had stacks of MacArthur tapes,
[00:16:41.500 --> 00:16:43.180]   like the old cassette tapes.
[00:16:43.180 --> 00:16:44.380]   And he was like, "You want that?"
[00:16:44.380 --> 00:16:45.580]   And he was just passing them around.
[00:16:45.580 --> 00:16:46.900]   And I was like, "Yes."
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.700]   And so what happened was he upgraded
[00:16:49.700 --> 00:16:51.500]   and bought the CD set of MacArthur CDs
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:53.700]   and he was giving away all his old cassettes.
[00:16:53.700 --> 00:16:56.900]   But from that moment I first met him,
[00:16:56.900 --> 00:16:58.500]   every time I walked into the student hall,
[00:16:58.500 --> 00:16:59.500]   I was asking,
[00:16:59.500 --> 00:17:00.540]   "Hey, what's going on, John?
[00:17:00.540 --> 00:17:01.980]   How you doing?"
[00:17:01.980 --> 00:17:03.020]   And without fail,
[00:17:03.020 --> 00:17:04.460]   every single time,
[00:17:04.460 --> 00:17:05.460]   he would say two things.
[00:17:05.460 --> 00:17:06.780]   The first thing was,
[00:17:06.780 --> 00:17:08.780]   "Better than I deserve!"
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.580]   You know?
[00:17:09.580 --> 00:17:10.700]   He'd always say that.
[00:17:10.700 --> 00:17:12.380]   And I'm always like,
[00:17:12.380 --> 00:17:14.780]   "Never complain to me."
[00:17:14.780 --> 00:17:16.900]   And then, with almost tears in his eyes,
[00:17:16.900 --> 00:17:19.820]   he'd say, "And one day we'll be free to sin no more
[00:17:19.820 --> 00:17:21.060]   and worship the king!"
[00:17:21.060 --> 00:17:23.700]   And he would put up his other thumbs too.
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:26.340]   And every seminary student who ever complained about,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.940]   "Oh, the work goes too hard here,"
[00:17:27.940 --> 00:17:29.260]   or like, "I'm tired,"
[00:17:29.260 --> 00:17:30.900]   like they would just come in to like,
[00:17:30.900 --> 00:17:31.740]   "You're right."
[00:17:31.740 --> 00:17:33.820]   And then, yeah.
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:35.820]   "Better than we deserve,
[00:17:35.820 --> 00:17:39.820]   and one day we'll be free to sin no more."
[00:17:39.820 --> 00:17:43.380]   See, this is a perspective,
[00:17:43.380 --> 00:17:46.820]   a faith perspective that we all need to have.
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:47.940]   Right?
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.300]   Where, for one perspective,
[00:17:51.300 --> 00:17:52.780]   all that persecution,
[00:17:52.780 --> 00:17:54.060]   everybody who's slandering you,
[00:17:54.060 --> 00:17:55.220]   everybody's attacking you,
[00:17:55.220 --> 00:17:57.180]   is causing you grief, anxiety,
[00:17:57.180 --> 00:17:59.060]   and a sense of defensiveness.
[00:17:59.060 --> 00:18:01.260]   But then, when you exercise your faith,
[00:18:01.260 --> 00:18:02.660]   not only are you just saying,
[00:18:02.660 --> 00:18:05.260]   "Well, I'm actually okay,"
[00:18:05.260 --> 00:18:09.340]   but the death that everybody's threatening you with,
[00:18:09.340 --> 00:18:11.540]   you almost have a perspective all the time.
[00:18:11.540 --> 00:18:15.980]   See what a great difference that is in faith.
[00:18:15.980 --> 00:18:18.020]   "Threaten me with death all you will!"
[00:18:18.020 --> 00:18:21.260]   But for me to live with Christ as the guy is,
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:25.020]   isn't something else.
[00:18:25.020 --> 00:18:26.940]   And so by application,
[00:18:26.940 --> 00:18:28.900]   there is this question.
[00:18:28.900 --> 00:18:29.820]   He's commanding us,
[00:18:29.820 --> 00:18:33.140]   "Are you armed and prepared with a sense of purpose,
[00:18:33.140 --> 00:18:34.620]   a sense of readiness?
[00:18:34.620 --> 00:18:35.580]   I'm going into battle,
[00:18:35.580 --> 00:18:37.940]   and in this battle I could very easily well-being,
[00:18:37.940 --> 00:18:39.740]   or most likely for them, die."
[00:18:39.740 --> 00:18:42.580]   But this death is not something to fear,
[00:18:42.580 --> 00:18:45.900]   but rather this death is going to be our freedom.
[00:18:45.900 --> 00:18:48.100]   It seems to me.
[00:18:48.100 --> 00:18:52.380]   And so although this may be hard to understand for us,
[00:18:52.380 --> 00:18:56.220]   we, as Christians, need to exercise this faith
[00:18:56.220 --> 00:18:58.380]   and go through a seeking and faith process
[00:18:59.620 --> 00:19:04.620]   to go from fear and anxiety to attitudes of hope, longing.
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.900]   Because for us, what we're looking forward to
[00:19:07.900 --> 00:19:10.300]   is actually death, is faith.
[00:19:10.300 --> 00:19:14.340]   Is faith from this decaying, painful death.
[00:19:14.340 --> 00:19:15.700]   Here's this interesting thing.
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:16.860]   You think about courage
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:18.740]   and people who are willing to face death.
[00:19:18.740 --> 00:19:20.460]   One of the more famous children's stories
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.460]   is "Dadrak, Meshach, and Abednego," right?
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.700]   And their story, essentially, you guys know the story,
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.140]   King Nebuchadnezzar, the Babylonian king,
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:33.100]   has this monumental statue built for himself,
[00:19:33.100 --> 00:19:36.220]   and he demands everybody needs to bow and worship.
[00:19:36.220 --> 00:19:39.940]   These three men, they don't want to do that.
[00:19:39.940 --> 00:19:41.380]   He says, "Nope."
[00:19:41.380 --> 00:19:43.300]   And King Nebuchadnezzar and his officials,
[00:19:43.300 --> 00:19:45.580]   upset and enraged, they threaten and say,
[00:19:45.580 --> 00:19:46.740]   "Look at this furnace.
[00:19:46.740 --> 00:19:48.340]   We're going to blow a red heart.
[00:19:48.340 --> 00:19:50.620]   And if you don't bow on the blow of a horn,
[00:19:50.620 --> 00:19:51.900]   you're getting thrown in."
[00:19:51.900 --> 00:19:55.180]   Crazy thing is, these young men essentially say,
[00:19:56.100 --> 00:19:58.180]   "I don't even need to answer to you."
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.020]   That's what they say, like,
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:01.700]   "I don't even need to speak to you all the time."
[00:20:01.700 --> 00:20:02.740]   But the God who serves,
[00:20:02.740 --> 00:20:05.220]   he can deliver us from that burning furnace.
[00:20:05.220 --> 00:20:06.300]   I had a belief in it.
[00:20:06.300 --> 00:20:07.780]   (laughing)
[00:20:07.780 --> 00:20:09.620]   God can deliver us from that furnace.
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:12.900]   But if he doesn't, they say,
[00:20:12.900 --> 00:20:17.700]   God still delivers us from your hell and your sin.
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.020]   What's the point?
[00:20:19.020 --> 00:20:19.980]   Right?
[00:20:19.980 --> 00:20:22.020]   What's the point?
[00:20:22.020 --> 00:20:24.020]   Live or die, it doesn't really matter
[00:20:24.020 --> 00:20:25.420]   because we're free from you.
[00:20:26.300 --> 00:20:27.620]   Live or die, it doesn't really matter
[00:20:27.620 --> 00:20:29.380]   because whose hands am I ultimately in?
[00:20:29.380 --> 00:20:30.220]   My God.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:32.940]   Whose presence will I enter into?
[00:20:32.940 --> 00:20:35.660]   So, threaten me all you want.
[00:20:35.660 --> 00:20:39.380]   And yes, this world is so afraid of pain, suffering,
[00:20:39.380 --> 00:20:40.580]   and especially death.
[00:20:40.580 --> 00:20:43.700]   And once you get their fear, they can control you.
[00:20:43.700 --> 00:20:47.220]   But me, I have this curse, a never-ending curse,
[00:20:47.220 --> 00:20:49.300]   that even if I die, if I suffer,
[00:20:49.300 --> 00:20:51.660]   nothing will separate me from the love of God.
[00:20:51.660 --> 00:20:55.380]   As a matter of fact, my death would actually mean
[00:20:55.380 --> 00:20:56.220]   my freedom.
[00:20:56.220 --> 00:21:02.380]   And so, on that level, it just kind of goes to show again,
[00:21:02.380 --> 00:21:03.620]   and there's our question.
[00:21:03.620 --> 00:21:07.300]   God is calling us to be prospective.
[00:21:07.300 --> 00:21:12.660]   To abide in faithfulness to the cause of God
[00:21:12.660 --> 00:21:16.220]   could mean all the world.
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.620]   But in our heart, are we prepared for that,
[00:21:19.620 --> 00:21:21.060]   with that kind of intent?
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.100]   Right?
[00:21:23.100 --> 00:21:24.780]   To purposefully.
[00:21:24.780 --> 00:21:25.820]   And I wanna add to that,
[00:21:25.820 --> 00:21:28.580]   not only are you willing to suffer,
[00:21:28.580 --> 00:21:30.820]   but the question is, are you willing to suffer
[00:21:30.820 --> 00:21:33.940]   even for the sake of the kingdom of God
[00:21:33.940 --> 00:21:35.340]   and the people of God?
[00:21:35.340 --> 00:21:38.540]   For the sake of those who would hear the message
[00:21:38.540 --> 00:21:39.380]   and be saved?
[00:21:39.380 --> 00:21:42.020]   Because remember, Apostle Paul wasn't just one,
[00:21:42.020 --> 00:21:44.420]   Apostle Peter included, is not one who would say,
[00:21:44.420 --> 00:21:45.980]   oh yeah, I guess I'm willing to suffer
[00:21:45.980 --> 00:21:47.900]   because God said it was necessary.
[00:21:47.900 --> 00:21:51.620]   No, he was willingly, voluntarily pouring out his life.
[00:21:52.540 --> 00:21:56.020]   Here's a passage to 2 Corinthians 4, verse 8-12.
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:00.100]   He says, "We are afflicted every day, but not thus.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:01.620]   "Perplexed, but not despairing.
[00:22:01.620 --> 00:22:03.500]   "Persecuted, but not forsaken.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:05.620]   "Struck down, but not destroyed.
[00:22:05.620 --> 00:22:09.260]   "Always caring about in the body, the dying of Jesus,
[00:22:09.260 --> 00:22:11.900]   "so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested
[00:22:11.900 --> 00:22:13.100]   "in our bodies.
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.620]   "For we who live are constantly being delivered up
[00:22:15.620 --> 00:22:18.460]   "over to death for Jesus' sake,
[00:22:18.460 --> 00:22:20.660]   "so that the life of Jesus also may be manifested
[00:22:20.660 --> 00:22:21.900]   "in our mortal flesh."
[00:22:21.900 --> 00:22:25.460]   So, death working in us, but life to you.
[00:22:25.460 --> 00:22:28.180]   You see that?
[00:22:28.180 --> 00:22:32.340]   It's one thing just to say, yeah, okay,
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:35.580]   I know life's gonna be tough, let's go through it.
[00:22:35.580 --> 00:22:39.500]   It's another thing to say, not just for my sake,
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:43.580]   not just for my reason, but for life to you.
[00:22:43.580 --> 00:22:48.420]   We are experiencing death, shame, that's what it is.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.940]   So wow, what a big challenge for us.
[00:22:50.940 --> 00:22:55.100]   That our expectations and being depressed with the past
[00:22:55.100 --> 00:22:58.860]   is challenging us to go far above and beyond,
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:00.580]   far above and beyond.
[00:23:00.580 --> 00:23:04.020]   So, as Scripture says, "Arm yourself with this attitude,
[00:23:04.020 --> 00:23:05.980]   "arm yourself with this purpose,
[00:23:05.980 --> 00:23:09.300]   "being willing to go to great extent,
[00:23:09.300 --> 00:23:13.100]   "even as many things in the past have as those of the modern
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:14.660]   "publication of the faith,
[00:23:14.660 --> 00:23:17.740]   "and even we will go that far."
[00:23:19.020 --> 00:23:21.020]   So, moving to the next section.
[00:23:21.020 --> 00:23:27.180]   I took the whole passage again in your lesson package,
[00:23:27.180 --> 00:23:31.180]   'cause again, I can't go through every single phrase
[00:23:31.180 --> 00:23:33.260]   and every, I wish that I actually broke this down
[00:23:33.260 --> 00:23:34.340]   into three terms,
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:38.700]   but we're gonna look at the flow of thought, okay?
[00:23:38.700 --> 00:23:40.700]   So let's, please read with me.
[00:23:40.700 --> 00:23:44.700]   "So therefore, arm yourself also with the same purpose,
[00:23:44.700 --> 00:23:47.180]   "since Christ has suffered in the flesh.
[00:23:47.180 --> 00:23:50.180]   "He who has suffered in the flesh has spewed some sin.
[00:23:50.180 --> 00:23:53.700]   "So, as to live for the rest of time in the flesh,
[00:23:53.700 --> 00:23:57.980]   "no longer for the lust of men, but for the will of God."
[00:23:57.980 --> 00:24:00.620]   And notice I've been kinda tagging purposes,
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:03.900]   okay, I'm gonna ask you to focus your eyes right now
[00:24:03.900 --> 00:24:05.460]   on purposes.
[00:24:05.460 --> 00:24:07.700]   It gives an explanation for the time already past
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:09.460]   is sufficient for you to have carried out
[00:24:09.460 --> 00:24:11.180]   the desire of a Gentile,
[00:24:11.180 --> 00:24:14.220]   namely, having pursued this course of sensuality,
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:16.460]   lust, drunkenness, carousing, drinking, parties,
[00:24:16.460 --> 00:24:18.300]   and abominable idolatry.
[00:24:18.300 --> 00:24:21.260]   In all this, they are surprised that you do not run with them
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:25.420]   into the same deceptive anticipation, as they malign you,
[00:24:25.420 --> 00:24:27.100]   but they will give account to him
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.140]   who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[00:24:30.140 --> 00:24:33.740]   For the gospel has for this purpose been preached
[00:24:33.740 --> 00:24:36.860]   even to those who are dead, and here's a great purpose,
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.500]   that though they are judged in the flesh as men,
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.420]   they may live in the spirit according to the will of God.
[00:24:42.420 --> 00:24:43.620]   The end of all things is near.
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:45.420]   Therefore, be sound of judgment,
[00:24:45.420 --> 00:24:47.100]   sober spirit for the purpose of prayer.
[00:24:47.100 --> 00:24:49.940]   Above all, be fervent in your love for one another,
[00:24:49.940 --> 00:24:52.580]   because love covers the multitude of sins.
[00:24:52.580 --> 00:24:55.460]   Be hospitable to one another, but without complaint,
[00:24:55.460 --> 00:24:57.780]   as each one has received a special gift.
[00:24:57.780 --> 00:24:59.500]   Employ it in serving one another
[00:24:59.500 --> 00:25:02.020]   as good stewards of the manifold grace of God.
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:06.340]   And then verse 11 acts almost as a commentary,
[00:25:06.340 --> 00:25:08.340]   that this flowing can be commended.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:10.020]   Whoever seeks it should do so as one
[00:25:10.020 --> 00:25:12.580]   who is seeking the utterances of God.
[00:25:12.580 --> 00:25:14.660]   Whoever serves it should do so as one
[00:25:14.660 --> 00:25:17.460]   who is serving by the strength which God supplies.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:22.460]   So that in all things, God may be glorified
[00:25:22.460 --> 00:25:25.340]   through Jesus Christ, to whom belong the glory
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:28.260]   and dominion forever and ever, amen.
[00:25:28.260 --> 00:25:32.180]   As you read through that passage,
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:33.260]   it should have been,
[00:25:33.260 --> 00:25:36.260]   'cause I asked you guys to focus on the purpose of this,
[00:25:36.260 --> 00:25:40.620]   it should have been a reference to timing
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:44.860]   and a reference to how that timing is moving.
[00:25:44.860 --> 00:25:46.180]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:46.180 --> 00:25:50.140]   There's a goal and trajectory to what Jesus talks about.
[00:25:50.140 --> 00:25:53.060]   And that goal means, in verse two,
[00:25:53.060 --> 00:25:55.740]   he talks about the will of God, right?
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:26:01.820]   That women were to no longer live for the lust,
[00:26:01.820 --> 00:26:03.300]   but the will of God.
[00:26:03.300 --> 00:26:06.140]   Verse six, that the gospel is preached,
[00:26:06.140 --> 00:26:07.940]   that as people are judged,
[00:26:07.940 --> 00:26:10.380]   they may live in the spirit according to the what?
[00:26:10.380 --> 00:26:11.980]   To the will of God.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:14.900]   And whoever is doing anything in terms of service,
[00:26:14.900 --> 00:26:18.380]   that is, whoever is speaking or whoever is serving
[00:26:18.380 --> 00:26:20.020]   with the strength that God supplies,
[00:26:20.020 --> 00:26:21.420]   sold out in what?
[00:26:21.420 --> 00:26:25.140]   In all things, God may be glorified through Jesus Christ,
[00:26:25.140 --> 00:26:28.980]   to whom belong the glory and dominion forever and ever,
[00:26:28.980 --> 00:26:29.820]   amen.
[00:26:29.820 --> 00:26:33.660]   Now let's take a moment to think about it.
[00:26:33.660 --> 00:26:34.580]   In this section,
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:39.740]   the command was to arm yourself with equipment.
[00:26:39.740 --> 00:26:42.860]   But this section is perfect in terms of the goal,
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.500]   ultimately, is the will and glory of God.
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:49.380]   This section is the will and glory of God.
[00:26:49.380 --> 00:26:52.740]   Now I wanna take a moment just to speak,
[00:26:52.740 --> 00:26:56.180]   you know, application for us, truthfully, to speak to you.
[00:26:56.180 --> 00:26:58.500]   There are times in your Christian life
[00:26:58.500 --> 00:27:00.180]   where you don't want to suffer.
[00:27:00.180 --> 00:27:03.020]   We just like not willing to suffer.
[00:27:03.020 --> 00:27:06.300]   As a matter of fact, there are times in your Christian life
[00:27:06.300 --> 00:27:09.500]   when you're not even willing to be inconvenienced.
[00:27:09.500 --> 00:27:11.100]   There are times in our Christian life
[00:27:11.100 --> 00:27:12.740]   where we're not willing to lose anything,
[00:27:12.740 --> 00:27:14.420]   we're not willing to sacrifice,
[00:27:14.420 --> 00:27:17.380]   we're not willing to sacrifice time or money,
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.500]   we're not willing to do whatever is uncomfortable.
[00:27:20.500 --> 00:27:26.140]   But could it be the case because, you know,
[00:27:26.140 --> 00:27:30.300]   that kind of heart condition that we're not willing to have
[00:27:30.300 --> 00:27:33.740]   is because we lost clarity of the purpose of life.
[00:27:33.740 --> 00:27:38.940]   Because there are times when you are more than willing
[00:27:38.940 --> 00:27:41.780]   to persevere, to sacrifice your sleep,
[00:27:41.780 --> 00:27:45.540]   to sacrifice your own well-being, to sacrifice your looks.
[00:27:45.540 --> 00:27:47.820]   There are times when you're more than willing
[00:27:47.820 --> 00:27:52.220]   to experience pain, suffer, and give everything you've got.
[00:27:52.220 --> 00:27:55.340]   What are those moments?
[00:27:55.340 --> 00:27:58.860]   When you're crystal clear about what to do.
[00:27:58.860 --> 00:28:00.900]   When you're crystal clear about your purpose
[00:28:00.900 --> 00:28:04.260]   and you can answer, "Why are you doing that?"
[00:28:04.260 --> 00:28:06.500]   That's when you can do it.
[00:28:06.500 --> 00:28:08.460]   So here's my challenge to us is,
[00:28:08.460 --> 00:28:12.140]   the goal for every Christian should be the glory of God.
[00:28:12.140 --> 00:28:15.140]   Whether it be you're experiencing hardship,
[00:28:15.140 --> 00:28:17.380]   whether it's you're serving, whether it's you're worshiping,
[00:28:17.380 --> 00:28:19.860]   whether it's you're loving, whatever you are doing,
[00:28:19.860 --> 00:28:23.780]   the goal of every Christian is to glorify and honor God.
[00:28:23.780 --> 00:28:26.140]   Our sinful state before Christ,
[00:28:26.140 --> 00:28:28.700]   you fall short of the glory of God.
[00:28:28.700 --> 00:28:31.620]   Your state after Christ, you are giving,
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:34.500]   representing, and being a light to the glory of God.
[00:28:34.500 --> 00:28:36.260]   You're proclaiming that glory,
[00:28:36.260 --> 00:28:38.860]   and that glory of God is now impressed upon you.
[00:28:38.860 --> 00:28:41.980]   That's quite amazing.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:46.100]   It is our calling, brothers and sisters,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:49.860]   to have a deep devotion and passion.
[00:28:49.860 --> 00:28:52.700]   You, even if you're not a pastor, missionary,
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:54.380]   worker in the church, whatever it may be,
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:56.420]   if you call on the name of God,
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:28:59.100]   you should have as your number one ambition,
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.660]   you should have as your deepest rooted passion,
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.980]   I want to glorify God.
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:07.820]   I will do everything the Lord asks.
[00:29:07.820 --> 00:29:14.740]   I will do everything that seems right to glorify my God.
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:16.980]   I will be your number one desire.
[00:29:16.980 --> 00:29:19.100]   1 Corinthians 10, verse 31 says,
[00:29:19.100 --> 00:29:21.860]   "Whether then you eat or drink,
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:26.100]   whatever you do, do all to the glory of God."
[00:29:26.100 --> 00:29:28.580]   Colossians 3, verse 17,
[00:29:28.580 --> 00:29:30.620]   "Whatever you do in word or deed,
[00:29:30.620 --> 00:29:32.460]   do all in the name of the Lord Jesus,
[00:29:32.460 --> 00:29:35.180]   giving thanks through Him to God the Father."
[00:29:35.180 --> 00:29:40.060]   And then, Christ's own words, when He is predicting,
[00:29:40.060 --> 00:29:41.500]   He's already entered Jerusalem,
[00:29:41.500 --> 00:29:44.860]   on His way to the cross, He's predicting His suffering.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:46.260]   In John 12, 27, He says,
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:49.020]   "Now my soul has become troubled.
[00:29:49.020 --> 00:29:52.060]   At what shall I say, 'Father, save me from this hour?
[00:29:52.060 --> 00:29:54.140]   Before this purpose I came to this hour.
[00:29:54.140 --> 00:29:57.380]   Father, glorify Your name.'"
[00:29:57.380 --> 00:30:01.940]   If you want to learn about the glory of God,
[00:30:01.940 --> 00:30:04.860]   I mean, just read some of John Piper's stuff.
[00:30:04.860 --> 00:30:08.740]   He has this book where, from beginning to end,
[00:30:08.740 --> 00:30:10.540]   he just goes on.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:12.180]   Creation is for God's glory.
[00:30:12.180 --> 00:30:14.020]   The creation of man is for God's glory.
[00:30:14.020 --> 00:30:16.020]   The purpose of exemption is God's glory.
[00:30:16.020 --> 00:30:17.420]   The reason why Jesus came,
[00:30:17.420 --> 00:30:18.780]   the reason why Jesus sacrificed,
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:20.940]   is the reason why Jesus is redeeming you,
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.820]   the reason why He's creating a new heaven.
[00:30:22.820 --> 00:30:25.340]   Every single thing from beginning to end
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:28.460]   and all that He wrote is for His glory.
[00:30:29.500 --> 00:30:32.420]   And scriptures tell us that God Himself
[00:30:32.420 --> 00:30:34.500]   is passionate about His glory.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.900]   Look at this verse that's in Psalm 79.
[00:30:36.900 --> 00:30:39.140]   I think I quoted it on your packet.
[00:30:39.140 --> 00:30:39.980]   Verse nine, it says,
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:42.020]   "Help us, O God, of our salvation
[00:30:42.020 --> 00:30:44.220]   with the glory of Thy name,
[00:30:44.220 --> 00:30:47.180]   and deliver us and forgive us of our sins,
[00:30:47.180 --> 00:30:49.620]   for Thy name's sake."
[00:30:49.620 --> 00:30:50.460]   In Isaiah, He says,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:51.940]   "I am the Lord, that is My name,
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:54.540]   and My glory and His known power."
[00:30:56.100 --> 00:30:59.860]   We live in quite a twisted generation
[00:30:59.860 --> 00:31:01.860]   where people have made everything
[00:31:01.860 --> 00:31:03.220]   about the Christian church
[00:31:03.220 --> 00:31:06.020]   and everything about the essentials of the gospel
[00:31:06.020 --> 00:31:08.780]   to serve and feed their well-being.
[00:31:08.780 --> 00:31:13.300]   And it doesn't compute for them
[00:31:13.300 --> 00:31:16.140]   if some reason, as they live their Christian lives,
[00:31:16.140 --> 00:31:19.180]   that the will of God now all of a sudden includes
[00:31:19.180 --> 00:31:20.860]   God might want you to stop.
[00:31:24.380 --> 00:31:26.460]   That roadblock doesn't come because of the truth.
[00:31:26.460 --> 00:31:28.940]   That roadblock comes because we've twisted.
[00:31:28.940 --> 00:31:31.980]   We've made the gospel serve our ends.
[00:31:31.980 --> 00:31:33.540]   We've made the church serve our ends.
[00:31:33.540 --> 00:31:35.260]   We've made other people serve our ends.
[00:31:35.260 --> 00:31:38.180]   And when we do that, nothing we do will ever make sense.
[00:31:38.180 --> 00:31:41.580]   There's a part of me that wishes
[00:31:41.580 --> 00:31:43.820]   there's elements when I first got saved
[00:31:43.820 --> 00:31:46.420]   and we were all singing Vineyard songs.
[00:31:46.420 --> 00:31:48.940]   Yeah, those songs were not theologically rich,
[00:31:48.940 --> 00:31:49.980]   but I'll tell you one thing.
[00:31:49.980 --> 00:31:51.500]   Every time we sang
[00:31:51.500 --> 00:31:53.740]   and every time that we had prayer meetings,
[00:31:53.740 --> 00:31:55.700]   there was a central theme there.
[00:31:55.700 --> 00:31:57.060]   One, surrender.
[00:31:57.060 --> 00:32:01.260]   That I surrender my life to the glory of God.
[00:32:01.260 --> 00:32:02.700]   And it is my honest prayer
[00:32:02.700 --> 00:32:05.780]   and it is my honest exhortation to every single one of us.
[00:32:05.780 --> 00:32:07.380]   I don't know when was the last time,
[00:32:07.380 --> 00:32:09.260]   you know, collectively or individually,
[00:32:09.260 --> 00:32:13.100]   you prayed, "God, whatever you want for your glory,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:14.820]   "here it is, before you require it,
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:16.700]   "before you rip it out of my hands,
[00:32:16.700 --> 00:32:20.660]   "here and now, before you have to take it from me,
[00:32:22.180 --> 00:32:26.660]   "I give you everything, including my very life,
[00:32:26.660 --> 00:32:28.260]   "including my company,
[00:32:28.260 --> 00:32:30.020]   "including everything I've worked for,
[00:32:30.020 --> 00:32:32.100]   "including all of my ambitions, accolades,
[00:32:32.100 --> 00:32:34.860]   "including everything I count as success,
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:36.620]   "before you have to cry it out,
[00:32:36.620 --> 00:32:40.060]   "before you have to demand it and say, give it to me,
[00:32:40.060 --> 00:32:42.580]   "here it is, Lord,
[00:32:42.580 --> 00:32:44.220]   "because I want to give it all to you,
[00:32:44.220 --> 00:32:47.380]   "and I'm before you, God, to make you a glory."
[00:32:47.380 --> 00:32:48.700]   Okay?
[00:32:48.700 --> 00:32:50.660]   So, truthfully speaking,
[00:32:50.660 --> 00:32:52.780]   God, as an honest confession to you,
[00:32:52.780 --> 00:32:55.340]   a lot of times, the moments of great sacrifice come,
[00:32:55.340 --> 00:32:56.180]   like what?
[00:32:56.180 --> 00:32:59.660]   The need to demand it, right?
[00:32:59.660 --> 00:33:01.060]   When there's a demand on my life,
[00:33:01.060 --> 00:33:02.940]   because of certain circumstances,
[00:33:02.940 --> 00:33:04.300]   or because maybe other people need it,
[00:33:04.300 --> 00:33:06.180]   maybe some family needs it,
[00:33:06.180 --> 00:33:08.620]   and because of uncontrollable things beyond my power,
[00:33:08.620 --> 00:33:10.420]   it feels like God is asking me
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:11.820]   and flying things out of my hand,
[00:33:11.820 --> 00:33:13.980]   and so, therefore, I have to be like,
[00:33:13.980 --> 00:33:15.700]   okay, I surrender, I live in this.
[00:33:15.700 --> 00:33:17.860]   Can you see the difference
[00:33:17.860 --> 00:33:21.100]   between God and Jordan today and now?
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:24.700]   Before God asked me to cry his fingers open,
[00:33:24.700 --> 00:33:28.100]   for us to be prepared and armed with this ambition,
[00:33:28.100 --> 00:33:30.780]   God, I want to be loyal to him.
[00:33:30.780 --> 00:33:34.740]   And I'm willing, I'm willing,
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:38.140]   I'm willing to go where other saints have gone,
[00:33:38.140 --> 00:33:39.380]   saints have gone.
[00:33:39.380 --> 00:33:40.700]   I'm willing to go to the extent
[00:33:40.700 --> 00:33:44.860]   that your son has gone to exemplify himself.
[00:33:44.860 --> 00:33:47.820]   This is the great temple.
[00:33:47.820 --> 00:33:49.220]   I want to kind of make sure
[00:33:49.220 --> 00:33:51.860]   that we get that application of Christ.
[00:33:51.860 --> 00:33:55.940]   This passage, it challenges you to be Christian.
[00:33:55.940 --> 00:33:57.300]   So far along the line, he says,
[00:33:57.300 --> 00:34:00.500]   "Dan, don't be tempted by the lust.
[00:34:00.500 --> 00:34:03.700]   "Don't be tempted by the pagan idolatries,
[00:34:03.700 --> 00:34:06.060]   "and don't be tempted by all that stuff.
[00:34:06.060 --> 00:34:09.460]   "Keep your mind focused on the purpose.
[00:34:09.460 --> 00:34:10.740]   "You're not gonna suffer for anything.
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:12.740]   "Don't suffer for ease.
[00:34:12.740 --> 00:34:14.540]   "Don't suffer to just get out of it.
[00:34:14.540 --> 00:34:17.780]   "Don't suffer just to take revenge on the government.
[00:34:17.780 --> 00:34:19.620]   "Don't suffer just to get out of it.
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.460]   "Don't suffer just to get out of it.
[00:34:21.460 --> 00:34:23.260]   "Don't suffer just to get out of it.
[00:34:23.260 --> 00:34:25.300]   "Don't suffer just to get out of it."
[00:34:25.300 --> 00:34:26.620]   And those militia guys are like,
[00:34:26.620 --> 00:34:27.820]   "We can't bear to handle this.
[00:34:27.820 --> 00:34:29.060]   "We're gonna fight, you know?
[00:34:29.060 --> 00:34:31.660]   "You don't need to suffer just for that kind of cause."
[00:34:31.660 --> 00:34:33.740]   If you're gonna suffer,
[00:34:33.740 --> 00:34:35.740]   suffer for the glory of God.
[00:34:35.740 --> 00:34:38.740]   That's the next little section.
[00:34:38.740 --> 00:34:40.740]   A Paul's Peter explains.
[00:34:40.740 --> 00:34:44.340]   He says, "You know, there are two different types of people.
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:45.780]   "And then it kind of lumps together
[00:34:45.780 --> 00:34:47.780]   "on how we should live no longer,"
[00:34:47.780 --> 00:34:49.900]   in verse two he said, "You should live no longer for lust,
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.140]   "but live for the will of God."
[00:34:51.140 --> 00:34:52.620]   This is what I'm saying to the divine.
[00:34:52.620 --> 00:34:54.620]   There's two types of people.
[00:34:54.620 --> 00:34:56.340]   There are those who are living for their lust,
[00:34:56.340 --> 00:34:58.420]   and there are those who are living for the will of God.
[00:34:58.420 --> 00:34:59.340]   But then in verse three, he says,
[00:34:59.340 --> 00:35:00.940]   "For the time has already passed
[00:35:00.940 --> 00:35:02.740]   "is sufficient for you to have carried out
[00:35:02.740 --> 00:35:03.980]   "the desires of the Gentiles."
[00:35:03.980 --> 00:35:05.460]   And he goes, "List them off."
[00:35:05.460 --> 00:35:07.340]   And as I read that stuff,
[00:35:07.340 --> 00:35:09.540]   core sensuality, lust, drunkenness,
[00:35:09.540 --> 00:35:13.540]   and carousing, drinking parties, and barbaric idolatry,
[00:35:13.540 --> 00:35:18.540]   the picture that I get is what this world glorifies.
[00:35:18.540 --> 00:35:20.980]   I got the college vibe.
[00:35:20.980 --> 00:35:24.460]   You look at any of those silly movies,
[00:35:24.460 --> 00:35:25.700]   you look at any of the way
[00:35:25.700 --> 00:35:27.380]   that the media portrays college life,
[00:35:27.380 --> 00:35:28.820]   and they glorify that.
[00:35:28.820 --> 00:35:30.500]   Like that's really the hater.
[00:35:30.500 --> 00:35:35.300]   The people are just hidden to sexual pleasure.
[00:35:35.300 --> 00:35:36.980]   Great, 'cause they think that's cool.
[00:35:36.980 --> 00:35:38.500]   They just let go, right?
[00:35:38.500 --> 00:35:41.940]   Now the worldly perspective, to tell you honestly,
[00:35:41.940 --> 00:35:44.180]   that actually, to the worldly perspective,
[00:35:44.180 --> 00:35:45.540]   to them, makes sense.
[00:35:45.540 --> 00:35:46.940]   You notice how in the passage it says
[00:35:46.940 --> 00:35:48.500]   they're gonna look at people like,
[00:35:48.500 --> 00:35:49.620]   "Huh?
[00:35:49.620 --> 00:35:50.860]   "Why aren't you running with us?
[00:35:50.860 --> 00:35:51.980]   "Why aren't you doing that stuff?"
[00:35:51.980 --> 00:35:53.860]   Because if what you say is true,
[00:35:53.860 --> 00:35:56.340]   this world is coming to an end, you know?
[00:35:56.340 --> 00:35:58.660]   Like, "Oh, you know, all we have is to look forward
[00:35:58.660 --> 00:36:00.380]   "to his death," or whatever it may be,
[00:36:00.380 --> 00:36:02.940]   then what they're gonna say is what they've been saying.
[00:36:02.940 --> 00:36:04.300]   You only live once.
[00:36:04.300 --> 00:36:06.140]   Do it, do whatever the heck you want.
[00:36:06.140 --> 00:36:10.100]   So, go take in all that you can,
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:13.300]   go live it up, go have fun, give into your pleasures,
[00:36:13.300 --> 00:36:17.620]   and then you can be thinking in the right way.
[00:36:17.620 --> 00:36:20.220]   I really enjoy it, I really do.
[00:36:20.220 --> 00:36:23.060]   That's the world for me.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.980]   But the logic of God,
[00:36:24.980 --> 00:36:26.620]   and this is where I've asked you the question,
[00:36:26.620 --> 00:36:28.420]   when you're looking at timing,
[00:36:28.420 --> 00:36:30.860]   and the emphasis of timing of your time,
[00:36:30.860 --> 00:36:32.020]   what do you think?
[00:36:32.020 --> 00:36:34.260]   The end is near.
[00:36:34.260 --> 00:36:36.420]   For the godly individual,
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:37.780]   the perspective is not like,
[00:36:37.780 --> 00:36:39.900]   "Oh man, everyone's just, you know,
[00:36:39.900 --> 00:36:41.460]   "just sitting and enjoying all this stuff."
[00:36:41.460 --> 00:36:43.980]   The godly individual has this perspective,
[00:36:43.980 --> 00:36:45.180]   the end is near.
[00:36:45.180 --> 00:36:46.940]   Yes, we are all going to die.
[00:36:46.940 --> 00:36:49.540]   But he knows by faith,
[00:36:49.540 --> 00:36:52.220]   the end means nothing.
[00:36:52.220 --> 00:36:56.060]   The end means giving an account.
[00:36:56.060 --> 00:36:57.860]   The end means being held accountable
[00:36:57.860 --> 00:36:59.940]   for all that you've done, all that you've said,
[00:36:59.940 --> 00:37:03.260]   whether Christian or not, you are going to be judged, okay?
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.020]   That's the reality.
[00:37:06.020 --> 00:37:08.900]   That's the reality that Christian understand.
[00:37:08.900 --> 00:37:12.580]   And so for us, the idea here is,
[00:37:12.580 --> 00:37:17.860]   is that the world is thinking in their perspective
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:20.500]   how they see the reality and what their end is.
[00:37:20.500 --> 00:37:22.620]   Christians can look forward to it,
[00:37:22.620 --> 00:37:24.780]   that we are going to give an account.
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.820]   Turn your Bible to Luke chapter 12, verse 35 to 48.
[00:37:27.820 --> 00:37:31.740]   Let's go there together.
[00:37:31.740 --> 00:37:34.460]   Luke chapter 12, verse 35 to 48.
[00:37:34.460 --> 00:37:37.140]   (water rushing)
[00:37:37.140 --> 00:37:50.300]   He says here, "Be ready."
[00:37:50.300 --> 00:37:55.100]   How else would you be ready to be terrible?
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:37:57.300]   He says, "Be dressed in readiness
[00:37:57.300 --> 00:37:59.220]   "and keep your lamp lit.
[00:37:59.220 --> 00:38:01.060]   "Be like men who are waiting for their master
[00:38:01.060 --> 00:38:03.140]   "when he returns from the wedding feast,
[00:38:03.140 --> 00:38:06.060]   "so that they may immediately open the door to him
[00:38:06.060 --> 00:38:07.980]   "when he comes and knocks.
[00:38:07.980 --> 00:38:10.660]   "Blessed are those slaves whom the master will find
[00:38:10.660 --> 00:38:12.580]   "on the alert when he comes.
[00:38:12.580 --> 00:38:15.660]   "Surely I say to you that he will gird himself to serve
[00:38:15.660 --> 00:38:17.300]   "and have them be kind at the table
[00:38:17.300 --> 00:38:19.260]   "and will come up and wait on him.
[00:38:19.260 --> 00:38:21.020]   "Whether he comes in in the second watch
[00:38:21.020 --> 00:38:23.060]   "or even in the third and finds himself,
[00:38:23.060 --> 00:38:24.980]   "blessed are those slaves.
[00:38:24.980 --> 00:38:27.700]   "But be sure of this, that if the head of the house
[00:38:27.700 --> 00:38:30.100]   "has known at what hour the feast was coming,
[00:38:30.100 --> 00:38:32.900]   "he would not have allowed his house to be broken into.
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.700]   "You too, be ready, for the Son of Man
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:39.460]   "is coming at an hour that you do not expect."
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:43.020]   Peter is there and Peter says,
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:45.660]   "Lord, are you addressing this terrible to us
[00:38:45.660 --> 00:38:47.660]   "or to everybody else as well?"
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:50.140]   He's like, "Are you speaking to me?
[00:38:50.140 --> 00:38:52.100]   "I'm talking to them, right?"
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.020]   Well, the Lord gives you more.
[00:38:54.020 --> 00:38:55.900]   He says, "Who then is the faithful
[00:38:55.900 --> 00:38:57.380]   "when some people see him?
[00:38:57.380 --> 00:39:00.020]   "Who in his master will put a charge on the children
[00:39:00.020 --> 00:39:02.740]   "to give them their rations at the proper time?
[00:39:02.740 --> 00:39:04.940]   "Blessed is that slave whom his master finds
[00:39:04.940 --> 00:39:06.620]   "for doing what he comes.
[00:39:06.620 --> 00:39:08.940]   "Truly I say to you that he will put him in charge
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:10.660]   "of all his possessions.
[00:39:10.660 --> 00:39:12.940]   "But if that slave does in his heart,
[00:39:12.940 --> 00:39:15.660]   "my master will be a long time in coming.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:18.020]   "And he begins to teach the slaves, both men and women,
[00:39:18.020 --> 00:39:20.020]   "and he eats and drinks and gets drunk.
[00:39:20.020 --> 00:39:21.940]   "The master of that slave will come on a day
[00:39:21.940 --> 00:39:23.420]   "when he does not expect him,
[00:39:23.420 --> 00:39:25.260]   "and at an hour he does not know,
[00:39:25.260 --> 00:39:27.460]   "and will cut him to pieces
[00:39:27.460 --> 00:39:30.140]   "and assign him a place with the unbelievers.
[00:39:30.140 --> 00:39:32.220]   "And that slave who knew his master's will
[00:39:32.220 --> 00:39:35.020]   "and did not get ready or act accord with his will
[00:39:35.020 --> 00:39:37.020]   "will receive many rations.
[00:39:37.020 --> 00:39:38.660]   "But the one who did not know it
[00:39:38.660 --> 00:39:40.460]   "and committed deeds worthy of applauding
[00:39:40.460 --> 00:39:42.140]   "will receive but a few.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:44.580]   "From everyone who has been given much,
[00:39:44.580 --> 00:39:46.100]   "much will be required.
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:48.220]   "And to whom they instructed much,
[00:39:48.220 --> 00:39:52.060]   "of him they will ask all the money."
[00:39:52.060 --> 00:39:55.340]   For that challenge, and an apostle Peter said,
[00:39:55.340 --> 00:39:57.140]   "From Titus, now,
[00:39:57.140 --> 00:39:59.900]   "he will take the challenge.
[00:39:59.900 --> 00:40:03.420]   "I am returning, and you need to be ready as a good slave,
[00:40:03.420 --> 00:40:06.660]   "doing the will of God, being on duty."
[00:40:06.660 --> 00:40:09.980]   And that's why apostle Peter actually speaks much
[00:40:09.980 --> 00:40:11.260]   of the end times.
[00:40:11.260 --> 00:40:14.060]   Apostle Peter speaks much of what's to come.
[00:40:14.060 --> 00:40:15.980]   It's gonna exhort the people
[00:40:15.980 --> 00:40:18.140]   to be ready for that end as well.
[00:40:18.140 --> 00:40:20.220]   There's a passage in 2 Peter 3,
[00:40:20.220 --> 00:40:22.820]   verse 10 through 12, where it says,
[00:40:22.820 --> 00:40:25.220]   "But the day of the Lord will come like a peace
[00:40:25.220 --> 00:40:27.620]   "in which the heavens will pass away with a roar,
[00:40:27.620 --> 00:40:30.660]   "and the elements will be destroyed with a tent,
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:33.220]   "and the earth and its work will be burnt up.
[00:40:33.220 --> 00:40:36.340]   "Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way,
[00:40:36.340 --> 00:40:38.060]   "what sort of people are you being
[00:40:38.060 --> 00:40:40.460]   "in holy conflict and problem,
[00:40:40.460 --> 00:40:43.300]   "looking for and facing, coming of the day?"
[00:40:43.300 --> 00:40:50.540]   So, as his challenge is there, he says,
[00:40:50.540 --> 00:40:53.020]   "For you who know best,
[00:40:53.020 --> 00:40:56.100]   "for you who have hope of freedom,
[00:40:56.100 --> 00:40:58.260]   "the true freedom is death.
[00:40:58.260 --> 00:41:00.620]   "Be ready, be on duty."
[00:41:00.620 --> 00:41:03.180]   But what's the duty that he's talking about?
[00:41:03.180 --> 00:41:05.660]   Well, going back to our passage,
[00:41:05.660 --> 00:41:09.300]   there's a section, verses seven through 11,
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:12.340]   where there was a list of commands, okay?
[00:41:12.340 --> 00:41:15.620]   Talked about, "Therefore, be in sound of judgment,
[00:41:15.620 --> 00:41:18.060]   "sober in spirit, and appropriate in prayer.
[00:41:18.060 --> 00:41:21.780]   "Above all, be fervent in your love for one another,
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:24.380]   "because love hath a multiplicity.
[00:41:24.380 --> 00:41:27.300]   "Be hospitable to one another without complaint."
[00:41:27.300 --> 00:41:29.380]   And as he put it, he was especially here,
[00:41:29.380 --> 00:41:33.260]   "employ it in serving one another," okay?
[00:41:33.260 --> 00:41:37.220]   So there were various commands that were listed
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:38.180]   through and through.
[00:41:38.180 --> 00:41:41.020]   I'm not gonna go in long detail over these things,
[00:41:41.020 --> 00:41:42.860]   but I did wanna cover them.
[00:41:42.860 --> 00:41:45.620]   And from one of the commentaries I was reading,
[00:41:45.620 --> 00:41:47.460]   they kinda categorized them in three.
[00:41:47.460 --> 00:41:50.180]   These aren't like an exhaustive list
[00:41:50.180 --> 00:41:52.740]   of all that he could teach, right?
[00:41:52.740 --> 00:41:54.300]   From here until Christ comes,
[00:41:54.300 --> 00:41:56.740]   there's so many things that we could teach.
[00:41:56.740 --> 00:41:59.060]   But these, he says, kinda encompass
[00:41:59.060 --> 00:42:01.300]   every realm of relationships that we have.
[00:42:01.300 --> 00:42:03.940]   What does he mean by that?
[00:42:03.940 --> 00:42:05.500]   Well, in the first one, where he's saying,
[00:42:05.500 --> 00:42:08.740]   "Be sound of judgment and sober in spirit."
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:10.340]   We talked about being sober.
[00:42:10.340 --> 00:42:12.260]   We talked about being sound in judgment before
[00:42:12.260 --> 00:42:13.820]   in a previous passage.
[00:42:13.820 --> 00:42:15.980]   But rehearsing that, it's just simply
[00:42:15.980 --> 00:42:17.540]   regarding our personal thoughts.
[00:42:17.540 --> 00:42:19.300]   There should be a sobriety.
[00:42:19.300 --> 00:42:20.860]   There should be a sobriety where we have
[00:42:20.860 --> 00:42:23.580]   control over our thoughts, that we are in,
[00:42:23.580 --> 00:42:25.460]   as it literally would read in the Greek,
[00:42:25.460 --> 00:42:26.860]   in our right mind.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:29.180]   But when he talks about that,
[00:42:29.180 --> 00:42:30.900]   he attaches that to the prayer.
[00:42:30.900 --> 00:42:34.460]   That we need to be sober and clear in our thinking
[00:42:34.460 --> 00:42:38.100]   so that we can pray for what realm of relationships
[00:42:38.100 --> 00:42:41.180]   it is, it's the relationship with our God, right?
[00:42:41.180 --> 00:42:43.340]   That we need to make sure that we are in right standing
[00:42:43.340 --> 00:42:47.340]   and our conscience is clear so that we can pray.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:49.660]   And if you guys have ever experienced it,
[00:42:49.660 --> 00:42:52.580]   I'm sure you have, you know, you maybe wrestle
[00:42:52.580 --> 00:42:54.900]   with prayer, maybe you've wrestled with like
[00:42:54.900 --> 00:42:56.380]   going to God and peace and union,
[00:42:56.380 --> 00:42:58.060]   all that kind of stuff.
[00:42:58.060 --> 00:42:59.820]   And truthfully, there's a lot of contributing
[00:42:59.820 --> 00:43:02.100]   factors to that, but one of the main things is
[00:43:02.100 --> 00:43:05.220]   when my mind is not sure, when my mind is not clear,
[00:43:05.220 --> 00:43:07.580]   when I'm not thinking straight and I'm not sober,
[00:43:07.580 --> 00:43:09.500]   it is incredibly difficult to pray.
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:12.940]   But oftentimes, when you're removed,
[00:43:12.940 --> 00:43:15.300]   when you go to retreat, when you isolate yourself,
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.020]   when you're removed from distractions,
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:18.340]   there's a distinct intention,
[00:43:18.340 --> 00:43:20.980]   I'm trying to get sober here so I'm gonna get away
[00:43:20.980 --> 00:43:22.660]   from it all, I'm focused.
[00:43:22.660 --> 00:43:24.860]   And then all of a sudden, it's hard to focus
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.620]   quite easily, it's hard to focus easily, yeah.
[00:43:28.620 --> 00:43:31.260]   So in this first command of being sound
[00:43:31.260 --> 00:43:32.540]   and judgmental and sober and clear,
[00:43:32.540 --> 00:43:34.580]   there's a realm of all relationships with God
[00:43:34.580 --> 00:43:37.860]   and honestly speaking, our prayer really is
[00:43:37.860 --> 00:43:40.500]   our ongoing relationship with the Father.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:42.980]   And we need to make sure that that is maintained.
[00:43:42.980 --> 00:43:46.820]   And the second part, above all,
[00:43:46.820 --> 00:43:49.380]   keeping fervent in your love for one another
[00:43:49.380 --> 00:43:51.940]   because love covers a multitude of things.
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:54.420]   And being hospitable to one another
[00:43:54.420 --> 00:43:57.300]   talks about loving in the community,
[00:43:57.300 --> 00:43:58.820]   people around you.
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:03.820]   So here, I just wanna give some encouragement and talent.
[00:44:03.820 --> 00:44:07.180]   We've talked about being loving in a previous passage too,
[00:44:07.180 --> 00:44:09.420]   but he emphasizes by saying, above all,
[00:44:09.420 --> 00:44:11.980]   keep fervent in your love for one another.
[00:44:11.980 --> 00:44:14.060]   And then he adds this little note,
[00:44:14.060 --> 00:44:17.540]   because love covers a multitude of things.
[00:44:17.540 --> 00:44:21.540]   Love covers a multitude of things.
[00:44:21.540 --> 00:44:23.700]   Now if you're a strict individual,
[00:44:23.700 --> 00:44:25.340]   you're like, hmm, what does this mean?
[00:44:25.340 --> 00:44:27.660]   Does that mean we just turn a blind eye?
[00:44:27.660 --> 00:44:29.580]   You know, if the people are saying,
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:32.620]   are we supposed to rebuke, exhort,
[00:44:32.620 --> 00:44:33.780]   and all that kind of stuff?
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.660]   Do we just let some people go?
[00:44:35.660 --> 00:44:36.500]   What do we do?
[00:44:36.500 --> 00:44:40.340]   Now we don't have to get all dicey
[00:44:40.340 --> 00:44:42.780]   and try to draw a straight line.
[00:44:42.780 --> 00:44:44.540]   But I think there's a very clear difference
[00:44:44.540 --> 00:44:47.380]   between one who has an intention of love
[00:44:47.380 --> 00:44:50.060]   and a desire to protect each other.
[00:44:50.060 --> 00:44:52.500]   So it's just one who wants to express.
[00:44:52.500 --> 00:44:54.940]   You know, I remember when just recently
[00:44:54.940 --> 00:44:57.620]   I took my kids to one of these kids and parents
[00:44:57.620 --> 00:45:00.220]   get-together thingies, and it was for class,
[00:45:00.220 --> 00:45:01.500]   and it was sort of like all learning,
[00:45:01.500 --> 00:45:03.220]   but then after the session,
[00:45:03.220 --> 00:45:04.300]   they're just all running around.
[00:45:04.300 --> 00:45:06.740]   So you can imagine like 40 kids running around,
[00:45:06.740 --> 00:45:09.620]   playing with each other, and it's really, really weird.
[00:45:11.220 --> 00:45:14.300]   So sure enough, one of the boys is laughing and pointing,
[00:45:14.300 --> 00:45:15.500]   and one of them goes, "What's that?"
[00:45:15.500 --> 00:45:16.340]   And getting all mad at me,
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:17.180]   like I was just pointing and stuff,
[00:45:17.180 --> 00:45:18.980]   and all the parents were like, "Ee!"
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:20.780]   You know, so they run over and, "What's going on?"
[00:45:20.780 --> 00:45:22.700]   And the kid's like, "That guy's flying down!"
[00:45:22.700 --> 00:45:24.900]   You know, and he's just like, "Wah!"
[00:45:24.900 --> 00:45:26.220]   All of a sudden the parents go over
[00:45:26.220 --> 00:45:29.340]   and immediately it's like, "Covered, good."
[00:45:29.340 --> 00:45:32.140]   You know, "No one's taking a look here, nothing to see!"
[00:45:32.140 --> 00:45:35.020]   You know, it's just a little example.
[00:45:35.020 --> 00:45:37.940]   But there's a very clear difference between one
[00:45:37.940 --> 00:45:41.380]   who is 11% designed to cover the sins of mindfulness
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:44.500]   and self-help from the other.
[00:45:44.500 --> 00:45:45.980]   "Look at that guy's sin!
[00:45:45.980 --> 00:45:47.740]   "Look what he's doing!
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:49.340]   "Ah, he's flying down!"
[00:45:49.340 --> 00:45:50.660]   You know?
[00:45:50.660 --> 00:45:52.740]   There's a clear difference when your intention
[00:45:52.740 --> 00:45:55.140]   is to cover the sins of people,
[00:45:55.140 --> 00:45:56.540]   to cover their mistakes,
[00:45:56.540 --> 00:45:58.020]   cover over what they're doing,
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:46:00.460]   rather than to simply expose them.
[00:46:00.460 --> 00:46:05.260]   There's just an intention difference.
[00:46:05.260 --> 00:46:07.860]   And what's more, the idea of hospitality,
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:11.980]   this term simply means to love saints.
[00:46:11.980 --> 00:46:15.580]   To love saints, people who are outside of your comfort zone,
[00:46:15.580 --> 00:46:18.300]   people who are outside of who you're already familiar with,
[00:46:18.300 --> 00:46:20.260]   people who you think are risky
[00:46:20.260 --> 00:46:25.100]   because you don't know how to deal with them.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:28.620]   What's more, in verse 10,
[00:46:28.620 --> 00:46:31.820]   it talks about how each one has received a special gift.
[00:46:31.820 --> 00:46:33.300]   "To employ and serving one another
[00:46:33.300 --> 00:46:36.580]   "as good stewards of the manifold goodness of God."
[00:46:36.580 --> 00:46:39.900]   Here, I mean, it just does tell you
[00:46:39.900 --> 00:46:42.260]   that the Spirit and the Spirit of Christ
[00:46:42.260 --> 00:46:45.660]   has given us various things for the common good,
[00:46:45.660 --> 00:46:47.460]   and we have to use it.
[00:46:47.460 --> 00:46:50.340]   There's one Spirit that He has distributed to us.
[00:46:50.340 --> 00:46:51.940]   Each of the visitors
[00:46:51.940 --> 00:46:54.580]   seeks to use the edification of the Church.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:57.060]   And so in 1 Corinthians 14, verse 12,
[00:46:57.060 --> 00:46:58.580]   Apostle Paul says,
[00:46:58.580 --> 00:47:01.660]   "So also you, since you are zealous for spiritual gifts,
[00:47:01.660 --> 00:47:05.460]   "seek to abound for the edification of the Church."
[00:47:05.460 --> 00:47:07.300]   Okay.
[00:47:07.300 --> 00:47:11.300]   Now, a way of kind of wrapping that all up...
[00:47:11.300 --> 00:47:20.780]   I think so far,
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:22.900]   we've heard a lot of exhortations
[00:47:22.900 --> 00:47:25.140]   in our study of 1 Peter.
[00:47:25.140 --> 00:47:26.980]   Remember the whole series on, like,
[00:47:26.980 --> 00:47:29.220]   a whole section on the high calling of God,
[00:47:29.220 --> 00:47:30.340]   that even though they're a section,
[00:47:30.340 --> 00:47:32.940]   He's calling us to have purity, holiness,
[00:47:32.940 --> 00:47:36.220]   love, hunger for the Word, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:47:36.220 --> 00:47:38.540]   And here and now, even, there's this list of commands,
[00:47:38.540 --> 00:47:40.220]   and all of it now,
[00:47:40.220 --> 00:47:41.620]   where there's an exhortation to us
[00:47:41.620 --> 00:47:44.900]   that we need to be still maintaining
[00:47:44.900 --> 00:47:46.580]   every aspect of the relationships
[00:47:46.580 --> 00:47:49.140]   that we have vertically and horizontally,
[00:47:49.140 --> 00:47:51.580]   and to do all this by the power of God
[00:47:51.580 --> 00:47:55.700]   in His name, for His good.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:59.660]   And I want to kind of wrap up by saying this now.
[00:47:59.660 --> 00:48:02.620]   Understanding the context that they're in,
[00:48:02.620 --> 00:48:04.580]   these are individuals who are suffering,
[00:48:04.580 --> 00:48:06.940]   and they're in suffering.
[00:48:06.940 --> 00:48:09.380]   And truthfully speaking, when you've experienced
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:12.420]   not just, like, a general hardship through life,
[00:48:12.420 --> 00:48:14.900]   but a moment of season and phase
[00:48:14.900 --> 00:48:17.060]   in which you're really hard pressed,
[00:48:17.060 --> 00:48:19.340]   and these individuals were attacked from every side,
[00:48:19.340 --> 00:48:20.700]   and we talked about, you know,
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:22.300]   the kind of persecution they're going through,
[00:48:22.300 --> 00:48:24.220]   the confiscation of their property,
[00:48:24.220 --> 00:48:25.460]   the splitting of their families,
[00:48:25.460 --> 00:48:28.900]   the chasing out of their homes, all of it.
[00:48:28.900 --> 00:48:29.980]   Well, the fact of the matter is,
[00:48:29.980 --> 00:48:31.420]   when we go through a process like that,
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.420]   what that's going to feel like is a punch to the face.
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:38.100]   You're going to get this warning.
[00:48:38.100 --> 00:48:40.740]   What that feels like is you've kind of lost your bearings,
[00:48:40.740 --> 00:48:42.700]   and you're in a crisis situation,
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:43.980]   and when you're in survival mode,
[00:48:43.980 --> 00:48:46.620]   you're just trying to strap on to whatever you think
[00:48:46.620 --> 00:48:51.220]   is going to be firm enough to help you get out.
[00:48:51.220 --> 00:48:54.860]   For a lot of us, yeah, when you experience hardship,
[00:48:54.860 --> 00:48:59.060]   you might have that same kind of reason and reaction.
[00:48:59.060 --> 00:49:02.140]   We experience hardship and we're stumbling,
[00:49:02.140 --> 00:49:03.740]   and what's more, whenever we're stumbling,
[00:49:03.740 --> 00:49:05.220]   the thing that we're trying to do
[00:49:05.220 --> 00:49:08.460]   is just grab on so we can survive,
[00:49:08.460 --> 00:49:11.820]   and unfortunately, that desire to survive
[00:49:11.820 --> 00:49:13.980]   many times is going to look like us
[00:49:13.980 --> 00:49:15.980]   turning all the attention to ourselves,
[00:49:15.980 --> 00:49:19.740]   and it becomes a set-up for us to be stuck.
[00:49:19.740 --> 00:49:24.340]   The challenge today was that even in the midst of this suffering,
[00:49:24.340 --> 00:49:26.540]   that there is this intentionality
[00:49:26.540 --> 00:49:27.940]   that I'm not just going to recoil
[00:49:27.940 --> 00:49:29.740]   or grab on to anything,
[00:49:29.740 --> 00:49:32.300]   and especially I'm not going to allow my suffering
[00:49:32.300 --> 00:49:34.460]   to be an excuse to turn all of my attention
[00:49:34.460 --> 00:49:36.620]   to myself or the cancer.
[00:49:36.620 --> 00:49:39.900]   Rather, I'm going to be so intentional
[00:49:39.900 --> 00:49:42.620]   that even the way I suffer,
[00:49:42.620 --> 00:49:45.740]   even the way I take those punches,
[00:49:45.740 --> 00:49:48.780]   they're going to be going on the ground.
[00:49:48.780 --> 00:49:53.500]   So that's the kind of example R.J. has set for us,
[00:49:53.500 --> 00:49:57.020]   that in the midst of the greatest injustice,
[00:49:57.020 --> 00:49:59.780]   in the midst of the greatest apathicity,
[00:49:59.780 --> 00:50:02.060]   in the midst of the greatest pain,
[00:50:02.060 --> 00:50:04.260]   he was intentional as ever,
[00:50:04.260 --> 00:50:07.980]   so serious that he wanted to save the genes
[00:50:07.980 --> 00:50:09.860]   in many for the father,
[00:50:09.860 --> 00:50:12.180]   and ultimately as many are brought to the father,
[00:50:12.180 --> 00:50:14.500]   God will be given.
[00:50:14.500 --> 00:50:16.020]   I want to encourage you guys with that,
[00:50:16.020 --> 00:50:18.300]   and let's conclude with a couple of thoughts.
[00:50:18.300 --> 00:50:25.020]   Father God, we want to again thank you
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:29.940]   for the education from this pastor.
[00:50:29.940 --> 00:50:34.540]   I ask Lord that we continue to do a work from you.
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:40.860]   So that more and more we'll be free from self-deception,
[00:50:40.860 --> 00:50:43.660]   we'll be free from the kind of mutual love
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.780]   that the pastor talks about.
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:48.660]   We'll be free from the kind of worldly tricks
[00:50:48.660 --> 00:50:51.460]   that tries to grab on to momentary pleasure,
[00:50:51.460 --> 00:50:54.900]   which is a power-loss addiction.
[00:50:54.900 --> 00:50:58.340]   And Father God, I pray that you'll continue to do that.
[00:50:58.340 --> 00:51:00.980]   I pray, Father God, that rather we concentrate
[00:51:00.980 --> 00:51:03.500]   on looking forward to heaven,
[00:51:03.500 --> 00:51:05.420]   which is ultimately meaningful,
