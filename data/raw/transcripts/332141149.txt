[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.420]   (soft music)
[00:00:02.420 --> 00:00:09.620]   - Hi, first off, I wanna say congratulations
[00:00:09.620 --> 00:00:11.420]   and welcome to our new members.
[00:00:11.420 --> 00:00:13.340]   I'm Dean, I'm in the Family Ministry
[00:00:13.340 --> 00:00:14.740]   and I lead the Welcome Team.
[00:00:14.740 --> 00:00:15.940]   I wanted to just tell you a little bit
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:17.740]   about the Welcome Team and find out
[00:00:17.740 --> 00:00:20.660]   if you might have a heart to serve in this ministry.
[00:00:20.660 --> 00:00:22.620]   Welcome Team, we're the ones that you see
[00:00:22.620 --> 00:00:24.380]   with the blue lanyards, greeting people
[00:00:24.380 --> 00:00:26.420]   when they first come for worship service
[00:00:26.420 --> 00:00:28.820]   or ushering people to their seats.
[00:00:28.820 --> 00:00:30.140]   You don't need to be an extrovert
[00:00:30.140 --> 00:00:31.180]   to be a part of Welcome Team,
[00:00:31.180 --> 00:00:34.100]   you just need a heart to really show hospitality
[00:00:34.100 --> 00:00:35.180]   and love people.
[00:00:35.180 --> 00:00:37.540]   Actually, we'd love to have newer members as well
[00:00:37.540 --> 00:00:39.940]   because you have a closer perspective
[00:00:39.940 --> 00:00:42.700]   to what it was like to be new to our church
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.340]   and as the church is growing in numbers
[00:00:45.340 --> 00:00:47.460]   and in other ways, it'd be helpful
[00:00:47.460 --> 00:00:49.980]   to have you on the team as you understand
[00:00:49.980 --> 00:00:52.180]   what someone who's new might be seeing
[00:00:52.180 --> 00:00:54.340]   and what some of the questions are that they might have.
[00:00:54.340 --> 00:00:57.020]   So, definitely can tell you more about Welcome Team.
[00:00:57.020 --> 00:00:59.140]   Please contact me or one of the members
[00:00:59.140 --> 00:01:01.260]   of the Welcome Team if you'd like more information
[00:01:01.260 --> 00:01:03.100]   and if you'd like to serve,
[00:01:03.100 --> 00:01:04.940]   we'd like for you to prayerfully consider it
[00:01:04.940 --> 00:01:06.780]   and again, please get in touch with us.
[00:01:06.780 --> 00:01:08.060]   Thank you.
[00:01:08.060 --> 00:01:09.940]   Clean Up Crew is a simple way for us
[00:01:09.940 --> 00:01:12.880]   to love our brothers and sisters here at Brien
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:16.860]   and the Lord by keeping this house of worship clean
[00:01:16.860 --> 00:01:18.780]   and almost anybody can do it.
[00:01:18.780 --> 00:01:21.720]   What we do is we meet after second service,
[00:01:21.720 --> 00:01:23.180]   we sweep up the sanctuary
[00:01:26.100 --> 00:01:27.100]   and clean the bathrooms.
[00:01:27.100 --> 00:01:29.820]   It's a quick job, around 20 to 30 minutes
[00:01:29.820 --> 00:01:31.540]   and just a one month commitment.
[00:01:31.540 --> 00:01:34.780]   If you're interested in signing up,
[00:01:34.780 --> 00:01:37.700]   you can contact Brien Pomonikin
[00:01:37.700 --> 00:01:39.100]   and he'll get you hooked up.
[00:01:39.100 --> 00:01:42.340]   Hi, my name is Victoria
[00:01:42.340 --> 00:01:44.300]   and I just wanted to say how thankful I am
[00:01:44.300 --> 00:01:46.380]   for Parking Ministry,
[00:01:46.380 --> 00:01:49.180]   just the opportunity to serve with so many,
[00:01:49.180 --> 00:01:51.060]   their brothers and sisters,
[00:01:51.060 --> 00:01:52.460]   just being able to greet
[00:01:52.460 --> 00:01:56.740]   and just helping just direct flow of traffic
[00:01:56.740 --> 00:01:59.300]   in the different lots and everything like that.
[00:01:59.300 --> 00:02:02.420]   Just personally, I feel like anyone can do it,
[00:02:02.420 --> 00:02:06.100]   so you don't need any special talent or skills
[00:02:06.100 --> 00:02:08.020]   or any gifts or anything like that.
[00:02:08.020 --> 00:02:10.660]   Just if you have a willing heart to serve
[00:02:10.660 --> 00:02:13.540]   and just be able to, yeah,
[00:02:13.540 --> 00:02:15.180]   just encourage those
[00:02:15.180 --> 00:02:17.000]   and just greet everyone who's coming to church,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:20.860]   whether they're newcomers or members of the church,
[00:02:20.860 --> 00:02:24.700]   it's just a great way to just greet everyone in the morning.
[00:02:24.700 --> 00:02:26.340]   Hope you're able to sign up.
[00:02:26.340 --> 00:02:29.460]   We encourage a month long commitment,
[00:02:29.460 --> 00:02:32.220]   but just whatever days you're able to do,
[00:02:32.220 --> 00:02:34.380]   we'd love to have you there, so thank you.
[00:02:34.380 --> 00:02:37.660]   Hi, my name is Mitchell Kim.
[00:02:37.660 --> 00:02:40.700]   My wife, Grace, and I are in charge of Snack Team.
[00:02:40.700 --> 00:02:42.780]   Snack Team is a ministry
[00:02:42.780 --> 00:02:45.480]   that uses one of God's great gifts, food,
[00:02:45.480 --> 00:02:47.380]   to help facilitate fellowship
[00:02:47.380 --> 00:02:49.820]   in the church body after service.
[00:02:49.820 --> 00:02:52.860]   Volunteers sign up for one month out of the year
[00:02:52.860 --> 00:02:55.820]   to help prepare and serve snacks.
[00:02:55.820 --> 00:02:58.280]   So it's a fairly unintimidating way
[00:02:58.280 --> 00:03:01.360]   to be involved in ministry at church.
[00:03:01.360 --> 00:03:04.640]   No prior cooking experience is needed,
[00:03:04.640 --> 00:03:07.860]   just the heart that wants to serve the church body.
[00:03:07.860 --> 00:03:09.460]   If you would like to sign up
[00:03:09.460 --> 00:03:12.460]   or find out more information about Snack Team,
[00:03:12.460 --> 00:03:16.060]   you can contact either myself or my wife
[00:03:16.060 --> 00:03:19.060]   through Facebook, email, or text.
[00:03:19.060 --> 00:03:21.420]   We look forward to serving with you, thank you.
[00:03:21.980 --> 00:03:24.560]   (gentle music)
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.140]   (gentle music)
