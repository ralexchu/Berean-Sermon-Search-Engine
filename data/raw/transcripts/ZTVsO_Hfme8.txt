[00:14:49.960 --> 00:15:00.200]   - All right, good morning.
[00:15:00.200 --> 00:15:02.200]   Welcome to Brink Community Church.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:05.200]   Let me get us started with a few announcements.
[00:15:05.200 --> 00:15:07.200]   First of all, today after the second service
[00:15:07.200 --> 00:15:09.200]   at 1.30 in the main sanctuary,
[00:15:09.200 --> 00:15:14.200]   we have the parents meeting at 1.30 in this room.
[00:15:14.200 --> 00:15:17.200]   So if you have a child in the seeds department,
[00:15:17.200 --> 00:15:19.200]   that's the four and under,
[00:15:19.200 --> 00:15:22.200]   please come at 1.30 and they're gonna be giving you updates,
[00:15:22.200 --> 00:15:25.200]   the teachers, the curriculum, and all that stuff.
[00:15:25.200 --> 00:15:26.200]   And if you have any questions,
[00:15:26.200 --> 00:15:28.200]   they'll be able to answer at that time.
[00:15:28.200 --> 00:15:29.200]   So please stick around, grab lunch,
[00:15:29.200 --> 00:15:31.200]   and come back here by 1.30.
[00:15:31.200 --> 00:15:33.200]   This coming Saturday at 9 a.m.,
[00:15:33.200 --> 00:15:36.200]   we have an all church cleaning and maintenance day.
[00:15:36.200 --> 00:15:39.200]   And so I was asked by the logistics team
[00:15:39.200 --> 00:15:42.200]   to give it a little bit push because we have,
[00:15:42.200 --> 00:15:45.200]   we have some people signed up, but we need more.
[00:15:45.200 --> 00:15:47.200]   And so if you're available this Saturday, please come.
[00:15:47.200 --> 00:15:49.200]   And I think there is a sign up table.
[00:15:49.200 --> 00:15:51.200]   If you go outside, you can sign up there
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:52.200]   just to let us know.
[00:15:52.200 --> 00:15:54.200]   And then there's very specific areas
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:55.200]   that needs to be covered.
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:56.200]   So if you're available,
[00:15:56.200 --> 00:15:58.200]   they asked me to give a little bit of push
[00:15:58.200 --> 00:16:01.200]   so you can come and help out with that.
[00:16:01.200 --> 00:16:03.200]   Okay, this coming Saturday.
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:07.200]   On August 24th at 10 a.m., our outreach group,
[00:16:07.200 --> 00:16:09.200]   they've been very busy and doing a great job.
[00:16:09.200 --> 00:16:11.200]   We have a volleyball park day
[00:16:11.200 --> 00:16:14.200]   specifically for the purpose of outreach.
[00:16:14.200 --> 00:16:16.200]   If you have a co-worker, family, or friend
[00:16:16.200 --> 00:16:17.200]   that you want to reach out to,
[00:16:17.200 --> 00:16:19.200]   they're going to be having a picnic,
[00:16:19.200 --> 00:16:20.200]   you know, centered around volleyball.
[00:16:20.200 --> 00:16:21.200]   And they did this once already,
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:23.200]   and it was very effective.
[00:16:23.200 --> 00:16:24.200]   And so many of our church members
[00:16:24.200 --> 00:16:27.200]   brought family and friends out to that event.
[00:16:27.200 --> 00:16:29.200]   And so they're asking if you have that
[00:16:29.200 --> 00:16:30.200]   and you can benefit from that,
[00:16:30.200 --> 00:16:32.200]   you want somebody to come.
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.200]   That day is happening on August 24th at 10 a.m.
[00:16:35.200 --> 00:16:37.200]   So more specific announcements for that
[00:16:37.200 --> 00:16:40.200]   are on the website in our church app.
[00:16:40.200 --> 00:16:43.200]   So please check for more information on that.
[00:16:43.200 --> 00:16:45.200]   The Tenfold Covenant Bible study that we're starting.
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:47.200]   So again, this session of Bible,
[00:16:47.200 --> 00:16:48.200]   this fall Bible study is going to be
[00:16:48.200 --> 00:16:49.200]   a little bit different.
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:51.200]   Instead of an inductive Bible study,
[00:16:51.200 --> 00:16:53.200]   we're going to be going over the Tenfold Covenant.
[00:16:53.200 --> 00:16:56.200]   And we want to kind of try to bring our church
[00:16:56.200 --> 00:16:57.200]   together on the same page
[00:16:57.200 --> 00:16:58.200]   because we have so many people
[00:16:58.200 --> 00:17:00.200]   who are new coming into the church.
[00:17:00.200 --> 00:17:01.200]   And then we have a lot of people
[00:17:01.200 --> 00:17:03.200]   who've been at our church for a while
[00:17:03.200 --> 00:17:04.200]   that we want to make sure
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:07.200]   that we're building our church very purposefully.
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.200]   And so that's why we're going over
[00:17:08.200 --> 00:17:10.200]   the reasoning and the theology
[00:17:10.200 --> 00:17:12.200]   behind the Tenfold Covenant.
[00:17:12.200 --> 00:17:14.200]   And we will also be reading all together,
[00:17:14.200 --> 00:17:16.200]   the whole church together,
[00:17:16.200 --> 00:17:18.200]   Master's Plan for the church.
[00:17:18.200 --> 00:17:19.200]   And so please sign.
[00:17:19.200 --> 00:17:21.200]   If you haven't signed up for that, please sign up.
[00:17:21.200 --> 00:17:24.200]   The small groups have already been made.
[00:17:24.200 --> 00:17:26.200]   So people who are signing up now,
[00:17:26.200 --> 00:17:29.200]   we may have to put new groups in.
[00:17:29.200 --> 00:17:31.200]   So please, if you are planning to come,
[00:17:31.200 --> 00:17:32.200]   please sign up.
[00:17:32.200 --> 00:17:33.200]   Or else you're going to end up
[00:17:33.200 --> 00:17:34.200]   going into an overflow group
[00:17:34.200 --> 00:17:35.200]   with all the newcomers
[00:17:35.200 --> 00:17:37.200]   that are coming without signing up.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:38.200]   Okay, so please sign.
[00:17:38.200 --> 00:17:39.200]   If you haven't done so,
[00:17:39.200 --> 00:17:40.200]   please do that as soon as possible.
[00:17:40.200 --> 00:17:41.200]   And then lastly,
[00:17:41.200 --> 00:17:43.200]   some of you guys who are interested,
[00:17:43.200 --> 00:17:47.200]   our annual BBA tournament,
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:50.200]   I don't know what you call it,
[00:17:50.200 --> 00:17:53.200]   sign-ups are going to be delayed a bit
[00:17:53.200 --> 00:17:57.200]   because they moved the dates from September to January.
[00:17:57.200 --> 00:18:00.200]   Okay, so the reason behind that
[00:18:00.200 --> 00:18:01.200]   is because of the schedule conflicts
[00:18:01.200 --> 00:18:03.200]   that we keep running into
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.200]   with Thanksgiving and Christmas coming up
[00:18:05.200 --> 00:18:07.200]   and various things
[00:18:07.200 --> 00:18:09.200]   and students coming into town in September.
[00:18:09.200 --> 00:18:11.200]   And so they moved it to January.
[00:18:11.200 --> 00:18:13.200]   So January, it will be sometime early January.
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:15.200]   Sign-ups will probably go out sometime in November.
[00:18:15.200 --> 00:18:17.200]   So if you are planning to play,
[00:18:17.200 --> 00:18:20.200]   and this is all true of WBBA
[00:18:20.200 --> 00:18:23.200]   and then the LBBA, okay, Legend BBA.
[00:18:23.200 --> 00:18:25.200]   So if you are planning to play,
[00:18:25.200 --> 00:18:27.200]   the sign-ups will be in November
[00:18:27.200 --> 00:18:30.200]   and they'll begin in January, okay?
[00:18:30.200 --> 00:18:32.200]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:18:32.200 --> 00:18:34.200]   I'll give you a minute to give the offering.
[00:18:34.200 --> 00:18:36.200]   And then again, our physical offering box
[00:18:36.200 --> 00:18:38.200]   is in the back as your exit.
[00:18:38.200 --> 00:18:41.200]   Okay, let's pray.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:44.200]   Father, we thank you for this morning.
[00:18:44.200 --> 00:18:48.200]   Lord, as you taught us
[00:18:48.200 --> 00:18:50.200]   that what you are looking for
[00:18:50.200 --> 00:18:51.200]   are people who will worship you
[00:18:51.200 --> 00:18:53.200]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:18:53.200 --> 00:18:56.200]   I pray that you will search us and know us,
[00:18:56.200 --> 00:18:58.200]   that we would give you worship, Lord God,
[00:18:58.200 --> 00:18:59.200]   that you deserve.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.200]   I pray that you would stir in our hearts
[00:19:01.200 --> 00:19:03.200]   a greater vision of Christ,
[00:19:03.200 --> 00:19:04.200]   that what we give you
[00:19:04.200 --> 00:19:06.200]   would not be simply lip service,
[00:19:06.200 --> 00:19:08.200]   but our very beings, our whole heart.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.200]   I pray that even in this giving
[00:19:10.200 --> 00:19:12.200]   that it would be an act of worship,
[00:19:12.200 --> 00:19:14.200]   act of surrender,
[00:19:14.200 --> 00:19:15.200]   act of acknowledging, Lord God,
[00:19:15.200 --> 00:19:17.200]   that you are our Lord.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:20.200]   And may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100-fold
[00:19:20.200 --> 00:19:22.200]   for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:24.200]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
