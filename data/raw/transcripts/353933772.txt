[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.860]   >> Okay. Sorry to interrupt your conversations.
[00:00:06.860 --> 00:00:09.820]   I hope you guys got through most of those questions there.
[00:00:09.820 --> 00:00:18.260]   So, before we begin, I'd like to do just a quick, like a intro to the study again.
[00:00:18.260 --> 00:00:22.840]   For a lot of you, you know, the practice of going through the questions,
[00:00:22.840 --> 00:00:25.520]   doing observation questions, maybe you've done a lot.
[00:00:25.520 --> 00:00:30.360]   I just want to make mention of the fact that that really is what we hope to be,
[00:00:30.360 --> 00:00:33.280]   really the bulk, the center of the study.
[00:00:33.280 --> 00:00:40.160]   Meaning, we could run the Bible study where I do the, you know, the bulk of teaching,
[00:00:40.160 --> 00:00:44.120]   take a solid 50 minutes to go over the passage, give you an outline,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:45.720]   give you the main points, that kind of thing.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.000]   But as you guys know, it was intentionally done where we wanted to have this format go
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:58.840]   inductively through the scriptures so that a lot of times the benefit of engaging
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:01:03.360]   with the scriptures comes from your own discovery, your own conviction,
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:07.840]   and essentially having your own eyes see the various convicting truths
[00:01:07.840 --> 00:01:09.060]   that are found in scripture.
[00:01:09.060 --> 00:01:15.480]   So, that being the case, please do make sure that in the upcoming Bible studies,
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.560]   I know some of you guys are running straight from work, so I understand if you're late.
[00:01:19.220 --> 00:01:24.340]   But please try to show up on time so that when we go into the beginning discussion,
[00:01:24.340 --> 00:01:28.780]   you take that bulk of time to share your observations, the questions you have
[00:01:28.780 --> 00:01:32.260]   about the passage, whatever interesting and convicting things you saw.
[00:01:32.260 --> 00:01:36.060]   Okay? So, if there was a focal point of the Bible study,
[00:01:36.060 --> 00:01:40.380]   it's not so much the formal teaching time, it would actually be the time
[00:01:40.380 --> 00:01:41.920]   that you're discussing with one another.
[00:01:41.920 --> 00:01:47.100]   Okay? So, I wanted to make sure you guys see just the relevance and significance of that time.
[00:01:47.780 --> 00:01:52.860]   And then, I'm going to try to, in the future, post up the discussion questions and things
[00:01:52.860 --> 00:01:58.460]   like that in advance so that you can even kind of prepare your heart for that discussion time.
[00:01:58.460 --> 00:02:04.500]   We know that trying to accomplish everything during one of the Bible studies is tough.
[00:02:04.500 --> 00:02:09.860]   Trying to share about your convictions, your applications, your week, any prayer requests,
[00:02:09.860 --> 00:02:12.100]   just trying to do everything is a little bit tough.
[00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:14.880]   So, the more you have time just to prepare your heart,
[00:02:14.880 --> 00:02:16.300]   prepare your thoughts would be better.
[00:02:16.300 --> 00:02:17.740]   Okay? So, as a heads up,
[00:02:17.740 --> 00:02:20.500]   to you that's what we're going to be doing each week.
[00:02:20.500 --> 00:02:23.500]   We're going to come in, discussion about the passage,
[00:02:23.500 --> 00:02:25.780]   specifically of observation questions.
[00:02:25.780 --> 00:02:28.660]   We'll have formal teaching, and then we'll go into application
[00:02:28.660 --> 00:02:30.120]   and personal discussion time.
[00:02:30.120 --> 00:02:31.240]   Okay? All right.
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:34.680]   Well, before we jump in, let's take a moment just to pray
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:37.700]   that God will bless our time, and then go from there.
[00:02:37.700 --> 00:02:43.720]   Lord, we again want to ask God that whenever we open your scripture and your word,
[00:02:44.000 --> 00:02:50.360]   even if today, Lord, it's overview, God, that your spirit would cause us to see.
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:57.200]   Lord, help us to see what is contained in your word and be desiring,
[00:02:57.200 --> 00:03:03.060]   both on the level of understanding your truth, but to want to know it
[00:03:03.060 --> 00:03:04.700]   so that it could radically change us.
[00:03:04.700 --> 00:03:08.700]   And I also pray, God, that you would help us by your spirit
[00:03:08.700 --> 00:03:11.440]   to have then open eyes to see our own lives.
[00:03:12.160 --> 00:03:16.600]   That God, as we see your perfect standard, as we see your perfect will,
[00:03:16.600 --> 00:03:20.980]   God, that it would automatically cause us to take a good, deep look at ourselves.
[00:03:20.980 --> 00:03:25.940]   And that, Lord, there would be just an evaluation and a desire to just regularly,
[00:03:25.940 --> 00:03:31.120]   incrementally, yes, but to regularly change into greater conformity to the image of Christ.
[00:03:31.120 --> 00:03:33.140]   So we thank you, Lord, it's in Christ we pray.
[00:03:33.140 --> 00:03:35.060]   Amen. Okay.
[00:03:35.060 --> 00:03:41.360]   So as we think about just beginning a book, I had four questions
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:45.480]   that I asked, and these questions I put into a specific order.
[00:03:45.480 --> 00:03:51.540]   Because you don't have to do this for every single moment when you begin a new book study.
[00:03:51.540 --> 00:03:56.060]   But for me, this is the way I like to think about it, and it helps me walk
[00:03:56.060 --> 00:03:58.900]   through the major categories of the book.
[00:03:58.900 --> 00:04:03.420]   To help me to put my mind around, okay, sequentially, if I walk through it like this,
[00:04:03.420 --> 00:04:06.220]   I will understand different categories of the book.
[00:04:06.220 --> 00:04:09.360]   Okay? And that is, again, first impression and tone.
[00:04:10.460 --> 00:04:14.720]   Then, thinking about the recipients and who it is that the author is talking to.
[00:04:14.720 --> 00:04:17.020]   What is the author's purpose?
[00:04:17.020 --> 00:04:23.020]   And then, therefore, what are the repeated themes or emphatic teaching of this book?
[00:04:23.020 --> 00:04:25.040]   Okay? So I know we could do a lot more.
[00:04:25.040 --> 00:04:30.400]   We could talk about historical context, which I trust you know how to look up and you can find.
[00:04:30.400 --> 00:04:34.020]   You could do a lot more talking about who is Apostle Paul,
[00:04:34.020 --> 00:04:37.220]   who are the specific people named in verse one and two.
[00:04:37.220 --> 00:04:39.920]   Why does he address it to both the leaders and the church?
[00:04:39.920 --> 00:04:43.180]   And you could do all of that, but because we're doing overview today,
[00:04:43.180 --> 00:04:45.580]   we're going to be talking about these main categories.
[00:04:45.580 --> 00:04:46.600]   So, let's begin.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:04:51.000]   I asked this question, what's your general impression and tone?
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:57.460]   Okay? And for a lot of people, it's pretty clear evidence just straight from the beginning
[00:04:57.460 --> 00:05:01.100]   that Apostle Paul, as he's writing through this church,
[00:05:01.100 --> 00:05:04.340]   he has a very thankful and joyful tone.
[00:05:04.340 --> 00:05:08.900]   What's more, he expresses, in terms of just kind of an impression,
[00:05:09.420 --> 00:05:12.820]   he expresses a ton of love and fondness for this church.
[00:05:12.820 --> 00:05:19.620]   Okay? And so, just as a heads up, we're going to be reading big chunks of the scripture today,
[00:05:19.620 --> 00:05:23.000]   big chunks of the book, so that we can get this whole overview.
[00:05:23.000 --> 00:05:26.680]   Let me read chapter one, verses one through 11 for us.
[00:05:26.680 --> 00:05:33.240]   And it says, "Paul and Timothy, bondservants of Christ Jesus, to all the saints in Christ Jesus
[00:05:33.240 --> 00:05:36.380]   who are in Philippi, including the overseers and the deacons,
[00:05:36.380 --> 00:05:40.480]   grace to you and peace from God our Father, the Lord Jesus Christ."
[00:05:40.480 --> 00:05:44.680]   Okay? So, that's a very typical introduction that you have there, right?
[00:05:44.680 --> 00:05:51.880]   And then he says, "I thank God in all my remembrance for you, always offering prayers with joy."
[00:05:51.880 --> 00:05:55.220]   And what you're going to see is that idea of joy repeat many times.
[00:05:55.220 --> 00:06:00.580]   He says, "In every prayer for you all, in view of your participation in the gospel
[00:06:00.580 --> 00:06:04.280]   from the first day until now, for I'm confident of this very thing that he
[00:06:04.280 --> 00:06:08.780]   who began a good work in you will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:06:08.780 --> 00:06:15.780]   For it is only right for me to feel this way about you all, because I have you in my heart.
[00:06:15.780 --> 00:06:20.500]   Since both in my imprisonment and in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,
[00:06:20.500 --> 00:06:22.880]   you all are partakers of grace with me.
[00:06:22.880 --> 00:06:28.360]   For God is my witness, how I long for you with all affection of Christ Jesus.
[00:06:28.360 --> 00:06:33.660]   And this I pray that your love may abound still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[00:06:34.120 --> 00:06:39.020]   so that you may approve the things that are excellent, in order to be sincere and blameless
[00:06:39.020 --> 00:06:42.960]   until the day of Christ, having been filled with the fruit of righteousness,
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:47.680]   which comes through Christ Jesus to the glory and praise of God."
[00:06:47.680 --> 00:06:51.740]   Okay? As we think about that, man, I just kind of highlighted in green.
[00:06:51.740 --> 00:06:54.560]   Every time I see lovey stuff, I just highlight in green, okay?
[00:06:54.560 --> 00:06:58.200]   You see a lot of it here just in this first paragraph.
[00:06:58.200 --> 00:07:00.820]   And then you're going to see more and more of it as you go.
[00:07:01.380 --> 00:07:08.560]   And if you take a moment just to pause and think of it, man, He speaks in ways that we normally might not.
[00:07:08.560 --> 00:07:14.440]   I don't know when the last time I said to somebody, "I have you right here in my heart," right?
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:19.940]   Or something like, "God is my witness. He knows how much I long for you."
[00:07:19.940 --> 00:07:25.020]   And that idea of longing is actually that desire where I want you. I want to be with you.
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:29.580]   So in many other portions of Scripture, whether it's 1 Timothy, 2 Corinthians,
[00:07:29.580 --> 00:07:34.080]   when He says that I long for you, He regularly says, "I long to be with you."
[00:07:34.080 --> 00:07:40.000]   Okay? So just by way of the emphatic way that He speaks, you can tell.
[00:07:40.000 --> 00:07:43.680]   Man, Apostle Paul is expressing an incredible kind of love for them.
[00:07:43.680 --> 00:07:48.980]   And one might ask, like, "Well, doesn't He do this with every single group?"
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:54.360]   I mean, He even does it in 1 Corinthians 1. He says, "I'm so thankful to God for you."
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.160]   That's how He begins. "You saints who are in Corinth."
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:08:01.120]   So is that the normal way that He just talks so we shouldn't think much of it?
[00:08:01.120 --> 00:08:04.720]   Well, we're talking about the overview of the whole book.
[00:08:04.720 --> 00:08:09.920]   You know from the other chapters in Philippians, He talks about how He's encouraged by them,
[00:08:09.920 --> 00:08:15.720]   how He is regularly thinking, praying. He's concerned for them just because He wants to protect them.
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:22.420]   Whereas in contrast, Book of 1 Corinthians, yes, chapter 1 starts with, "I'm so thankful to God for you."
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:26.220]   And then chapter 11, He's like, "Should I praise you for this? I will not." Right?
[00:08:26.220 --> 00:08:30.620]   It gets intense. And you read that and you're like, "Whoa." Right?
[00:08:30.620 --> 00:08:37.120]   And then in other chapters of that book, He's almost talking as if He wants to literally spank them.
[00:08:37.120 --> 00:08:42.220]   Other books of the Bible are actually really, really just heavy-handed.
[00:08:42.220 --> 00:08:44.620]   You think about Book of Galatians, right?
[00:08:44.620 --> 00:08:50.320]   Opening lines, yes, the same thing. "I'm so very thankful for you. Grace and peace be with you."
[00:08:50.320 --> 00:08:53.320]   But He gets serious really fast.
[00:08:53.720 --> 00:08:59.720]   If you in any way digress from the gospel, you turn. Right?
[00:08:59.720 --> 00:09:01.520]   There's like warning and warning.
[00:09:01.520 --> 00:09:08.120]   So a lot of times you have to think about the tone of the book because it says a lot about what Apostle Paul is doing.
[00:09:08.120 --> 00:09:09.020]   Okay?
[00:09:09.020 --> 00:09:13.320]   And what I'm going to say is, yeah, it's pretty amazing that this book that we're studying
[00:09:13.320 --> 00:09:17.620]   happens to be one of the most encouraging letters of the New Testament.
[00:09:17.620 --> 00:09:19.020]   Right?
[00:09:19.020 --> 00:09:20.720]   Certain letters are kind of sad.
[00:09:20.820 --> 00:09:23.320]   Apostle Paul's like looking towards death.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:25.020]   It's a pretty downer.
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:28.620]   But this book is very encouraging because he commends them.
[00:09:28.620 --> 00:09:31.420]   Now, we have to ask this question.
[00:09:31.420 --> 00:09:37.320]   Remember I said, when you start thinking on the general impressions, you start then sequentially thinking,
[00:09:37.320 --> 00:09:41.620]   "Oh, what about the other categories of this book should I understand?"
[00:09:41.620 --> 00:09:47.220]   And typically one of the big categories of the book you should understand is who are the recipients.
[00:09:47.220 --> 00:09:47.820]   Right?
[00:09:48.120 --> 00:09:49.320]   And I ask this question.
[00:09:49.320 --> 00:09:51.620]   What is Paul thankful for?
[00:09:51.620 --> 00:09:59.420]   If Apostle Paul is really joyous, if he's really fond of them, he's very much encouraged by what he sees.
[00:09:59.420 --> 00:10:02.420]   If you notice, I'm going to do this in orange because,
[00:10:02.420 --> 00:10:04.620]   I don't know, there's no reason for it.
[00:10:04.620 --> 00:10:05.820]   I'm going to do it in orange.
[00:10:05.820 --> 00:10:10.420]   And he says, "In view of," okay?
[00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:16.020]   So when I see that, I'm thinking, "Okay, Apostle Paul's saying, 'I'm so thankful, I'm so joyous,' because he sees them."
[00:10:16.020 --> 00:10:17.020]   Yes?
[00:10:17.220 --> 00:10:18.120]   He sees what they're doing.
[00:10:18.120 --> 00:10:20.720]   And so you got to ask, "What are they doing?
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:22.220]   What does he see?"
[00:10:22.220 --> 00:10:28.220]   And so the question was, "What can we learn about the people that Apostle Paul is speaking to?"
[00:10:28.220 --> 00:10:29.120]   All right?
[00:10:29.120 --> 00:10:30.720]   So question two.
[00:10:30.720 --> 00:10:37.720]   In question two, we learn that the people that he's talking to in the Church of the Philippines,
[00:10:37.720 --> 00:10:42.720]   he sees a group of Christians who are engaged in gospel ministry.
[00:10:42.720 --> 00:10:43.820]   Okay?
[00:10:43.820 --> 00:10:46.020]   They're absolutely engaged in gospel ministry.
[00:10:46.720 --> 00:10:48.420]   So where do I get this from?
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:54.620]   Well, what you notice is, you can follow along in the text packet, or you can just follow along in your Bibles.
[00:10:54.620 --> 00:11:00.620]   But if you notice, he starts talking about how, you know, he's praying for them with joy,
[00:11:00.620 --> 00:11:03.120]   in every prayer for you all, in view.
[00:11:03.120 --> 00:11:08.120]   And the first thing he says is, "Participation in the gospel from the first day until now."
[00:11:08.120 --> 00:11:15.720]   So they've been participating for the long haul of when Apostle Paul was ministering to them, and up until now.
[00:11:16.420 --> 00:11:19.820]   And then what's more, in verse seven, just a couple of verses down, he says,
[00:11:19.820 --> 00:11:25.420]   "For it has only arrived for me to feel this way about you, because I have you in my heart, since both in my imprisonment."
[00:11:25.420 --> 00:11:28.320]   So we're talking about his sufferings, right?
[00:11:28.320 --> 00:11:33.320]   His imprisonment, in the defense and confirmation of the gospel, he says,
[00:11:33.320 --> 00:11:36.520]   he says, "You are partakers of grace with me."
[00:11:36.520 --> 00:11:39.620]   That's really interesting, the way he puts that.
[00:11:39.620 --> 00:11:44.420]   Apostle Paul is talking about his suffering, his persecution,
[00:11:45.120 --> 00:11:48.220]   and he says, "You are part of this great thing."
[00:11:48.220 --> 00:11:50.120]   It was like, "Grace to me."
[00:11:50.120 --> 00:11:51.820]   That's pretty amazing.
[00:11:51.820 --> 00:11:57.920]   And he gets even more explicit in that kind of teaching when he says, in Philippians chapter one, verse 29 through 30,
[00:11:57.920 --> 00:11:59.520]   so if you scan your eyes down there,
[00:11:59.520 --> 00:12:07.820]   he says, "For to you it has been granted for Christ's sake, not only to believe in him, but also to suffer for his sake."
[00:12:07.820 --> 00:12:09.320]   That's huge.
[00:12:09.320 --> 00:12:16.220]   "Experience the same conflict which you saw in me, and now here to be in me."
[00:12:16.220 --> 00:12:20.420]   The reason why I say that's huge is because one might think like,
[00:12:20.420 --> 00:12:26.120]   "Oh, when he says participation in the gospel, he just means they really received it and they believed."
[00:12:26.120 --> 00:12:27.420]   Right?
[00:12:27.420 --> 00:12:31.920]   Like, "You're participating with me in this gospel because you're in it, you're in the game."
[00:12:31.920 --> 00:12:35.020]   Well, he makes it even more explicitly clear,
[00:12:35.020 --> 00:12:38.720]   not only are they in the game, they're paying the price to be in the game.
[00:12:39.220 --> 00:12:39.720]   Right?
[00:12:39.720 --> 00:12:41.420]   They're in the gospel ministry.
[00:12:41.420 --> 00:12:46.920]   They're alongside him experiencing the similar kind of persecutions as he went on his journey.
[00:12:46.920 --> 00:12:53.820]   And then later on in Philippians 4.14, he says, "Nevertheless, you have done well to share with me my affliction."
[00:12:53.820 --> 00:12:55.020]   Okay?
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:59.820]   These aren't the only passages, there are many more within the book where he talks about,
[00:12:59.820 --> 00:13:04.520]   "I'm so thankful and I'm so encouraged."
[00:13:04.520 --> 00:13:05.320]   Why?
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:07.020]   Because look,
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:10.620]   you're not sitting there saying, "Yes, I believe."
[00:13:10.620 --> 00:13:13.820]   You're actually showing it because of your sacrifice.
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.920]   Because there is a willingness for you to go there where you know it's going to hurt.
[00:13:18.920 --> 00:13:23.520]   There's a willingness for you to go there where you know you're going to have your privileges deprived.
[00:13:23.520 --> 00:13:29.020]   And in many ways, those are some of the things that are sometimes incredibly encouraging to us.
[00:13:29.020 --> 00:13:31.820]   When we hear and think about people who are in China,
[00:13:31.820 --> 00:13:35.320]   when we hear and think about those pastors who are in India,
[00:13:35.820 --> 00:13:39.420]   who don't have much but they straight walk into a village knowing,
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:43.120]   "I can go in there and literally be beaten to death."
[00:13:43.120 --> 00:13:46.120]   What an encouragement that is, right?
[00:13:46.120 --> 00:13:56.220]   Especially for Apostle Paul, he's sitting there thinking, "Wow, I'm so thankful because I see that we have this partnership, a koinonia,
[00:13:56.220 --> 00:14:00.620]   a true sense of the fellowship that we're in this together."
[00:14:00.620 --> 00:14:02.420]   That's pretty awesome.
[00:14:03.120 --> 00:14:06.220]   What else is that the people are generous people.
[00:14:06.220 --> 00:14:08.220]   Okay? They're generous people.
[00:14:08.220 --> 00:14:14.120]   And this we see because here in Philippians 4, 14 through 16,
[00:14:14.120 --> 00:14:19.020]   Apostle Paul says, "Nevertheless, you've done well to share with me in my affliction.
[00:14:19.020 --> 00:14:25.620]   You yourself also know, Philippians, that at the first preaching of the gospel, after I left Macedonia,
[00:14:25.620 --> 00:14:30.120]   no church shared with me in the matter of giving and receiving but you alone.
[00:14:30.520 --> 00:14:35.520]   For even in Thessalonica, you sent a gift more than once for my need."
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:36.120]   Okay?
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:41.220]   So on your papers, I do have a small map.
[00:14:41.220 --> 00:14:46.920]   And as you guys know, the travel that he does, he goes from modern-day Turkey area and he goes this way.
[00:14:46.920 --> 00:14:47.620]   Okay?
[00:14:47.620 --> 00:14:56.520]   So, what ends up happening is in the book of Acts chapter 16, it talks about Apostle Paul's ministry there in that area.
[00:14:57.020 --> 00:15:01.720]   And then later in 2 Corinthians chapter 8, he describes the Macedonians,
[00:15:01.720 --> 00:15:05.320]   the people who are here in this area.
[00:15:05.320 --> 00:15:06.020]   I am sorry.
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:15.020]   People who are here in this area, as those who are so generous, they're giving beyond even their own means.
[00:15:15.020 --> 00:15:17.820]   Okay? If you recall this passage in 2 Corinthians 8,
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:23.520]   he describes these people who even in their own need, they gave out of the generosity of their heart.
[00:15:23.520 --> 00:15:24.420]   Okay?
[00:15:24.420 --> 00:15:25.620]   He's talking about these people.
[00:15:26.220 --> 00:15:30.720]   So if you, I'm sure maybe you've heard this before, but the book of Philippians,
[00:15:30.720 --> 00:15:36.220]   this tone and tenor of the book has an incredible attitude of "I'm so grateful for you."
[00:15:36.220 --> 00:15:42.020]   And as a matter of fact, you can actually even look at the book as a thank you letter to this church.
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:46.220]   Because if you read chapter 4, he describes, "Man, not only did you give me once,
[00:15:46.220 --> 00:15:49.020]   but you even gave me in another time and I want to thank you."
[00:15:49.020 --> 00:15:52.120]   Not that I need it at all, not that God's grace isn't sufficient.
[00:15:52.120 --> 00:15:53.220]   I'm content.
[00:15:53.220 --> 00:15:55.520]   But look at your generosity.
[00:15:56.120 --> 00:15:56.620]   Thank you.
[00:15:56.620 --> 00:15:57.520]   Right?
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:01.920]   So as we do Bible study, we think about that and we think, "Oh man, wow.
[00:16:01.920 --> 00:16:03.520]   Look at this church.
[00:16:03.520 --> 00:16:05.420]   Look at this church.
[00:16:05.420 --> 00:16:07.020]   What a challenge."
[00:16:07.020 --> 00:16:07.720]   Right?
[00:16:07.720 --> 00:16:10.320]   What an encouragement that is already to us.
[00:16:10.320 --> 00:16:16.320]   To think about a church that's not just trying to get by living their lives on earth.
[00:16:16.320 --> 00:16:18.420]   They're engaged in ministry.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:22.120]   They're engaged in ministry to the degree that they would give monetarily.
[00:16:22.120 --> 00:16:25.620]   And they would do that to the degree where later on, Apostle Paul speaks about it,
[00:16:25.820 --> 00:16:28.920]   like, "Oh my goodness, you're even giving beyond.
[00:16:28.920 --> 00:16:30.820]   Beyond what's expected.
[00:16:30.820 --> 00:16:32.320]   Beyond what's normal."
[00:16:32.320 --> 00:16:33.320]   Okay?
[00:16:33.320 --> 00:16:34.720]   All right.
[00:16:34.720 --> 00:16:39.720]   Now, in thinking about the church a little bit more, there's one more thing we have to describe.
[00:16:39.720 --> 00:16:40.420]   Okay?
[00:16:40.420 --> 00:16:46.020]   He describes that there is a potential for division.
[00:16:46.020 --> 00:16:47.120]   Right there.
[00:16:47.120 --> 00:16:47.820]   Okay?
[00:16:47.820 --> 00:16:50.720]   The bad stuff I like to highlight in red.
[00:16:50.720 --> 00:16:52.420]   Division.
[00:16:52.420 --> 00:16:53.620]   Opposition.
[00:16:53.620 --> 00:16:54.920]   Does it exist?
[00:16:55.320 --> 00:16:55.820]   Yes.
[00:16:55.820 --> 00:17:01.520]   Can you have an encouraging church that receives the Word of God,
[00:17:01.520 --> 00:17:03.720]   that is engaged in gospel ministry,
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:06.320]   that gives, that sacrifices,
[00:17:06.320 --> 00:17:08.320]   and yet have drama?
[00:17:08.320 --> 00:17:10.320]   Of course you can.
[00:17:10.320 --> 00:17:10.820]   Right?
[00:17:10.820 --> 00:17:19.220]   Can it be susceptible to the false teachings that happen in lots of different arenas of, you know, spiritual life?
[00:17:19.220 --> 00:17:20.720]   It absolutely can.
[00:17:21.420 --> 00:17:25.520]   Here, one of the things that kind of is a giveaway that the church is experiencing that.
[00:17:25.520 --> 00:17:28.320]   What you see is in Philippians chapter 4,
[00:17:28.320 --> 00:17:33.820]   Apostle Paul says, "I urge Jodea and I urge Syntheci to live in harmony."
[00:17:33.820 --> 00:17:40.220]   So he emphasizes this idea of like, "I urge you, I urge you to live in harmony with the Lord."
[00:17:40.220 --> 00:17:41.120]   Right?
[00:17:41.120 --> 00:17:43.220]   Harmony in the Lord.
[00:17:43.220 --> 00:17:46.120]   So, you could automatically assume, it's like, "Oh man."
[00:17:46.820 --> 00:17:50.620]   He wrote this letter clearly to the leadership of the church,
[00:17:50.620 --> 00:17:52.020]   because that's in verse 1 and 2.
[00:17:52.020 --> 00:17:54.920]   He wrote this letter to be read to the whole church,
[00:17:54.920 --> 00:18:00.320]   and then he singles out two ladies in the church who are perhaps in disagreement and discord.
[00:18:00.320 --> 00:18:01.320]   Right?
[00:18:01.320 --> 00:18:04.020]   And imagine if you were Jodea or Syntheci,
[00:18:04.020 --> 00:18:08.720]   and it's like, "The apostle who wrote us this letter from,"
[00:18:08.720 --> 00:18:10.820]   do you guys remember where Apostle Paul is?
[00:18:10.820 --> 00:18:12.720]   He's in?
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:14.520]   Prison!
[00:18:15.220 --> 00:18:20.820]   He wrote from prison to our church to encourage us of how we're an encouragement,
[00:18:20.820 --> 00:18:22.020]   how he's thankful,
[00:18:22.020 --> 00:18:23.820]   and then he names you, right?
[00:18:23.820 --> 00:18:25.520]   Like, "Oh my gosh!"
[00:18:25.520 --> 00:18:29.420]   I just, sometimes you just gotta imagine if that was you, right?
[00:18:29.420 --> 00:18:31.220]   He'd be like, "I'm sorry."
[00:18:31.220 --> 00:18:33.020]   Right? He'd say, "I'm sorry."
[00:18:33.020 --> 00:18:35.220]   And you would reconcile, right?
[00:18:35.220 --> 00:18:37.320]   But I just wanna think about that for a moment is,
[00:18:37.320 --> 00:18:40.920]   Apostle Paul is caring for this church because
[00:18:41.620 --> 00:18:47.020]   we know that that kind of discord in the church can be very problematic.
[00:18:47.020 --> 00:18:48.220]   Right?
[00:18:48.220 --> 00:18:51.720]   I mean, if you have two sisters fighting, someone would be like,
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:54.620]   "Ah, you know, mind your own business, man.
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.020]   If you get in there, you're gonna get hurt."
[00:18:56.020 --> 00:18:58.520]   You know? Like, someone could have that kind of mentality.
[00:18:58.520 --> 00:19:03.220]   But the reason why he brings this up is because it's so important
[00:19:03.220 --> 00:19:05.720]   to the testimony of the church.
[00:19:05.720 --> 00:19:09.920]   It's so important for the character of the church to be Christ-like.
[00:19:09.920 --> 00:19:10.720]   Right?
[00:19:11.420 --> 00:19:12.920]   And so, Apostle Paul addresses that.
[00:19:12.920 --> 00:19:15.920]   And as you guys know, one of the more emphatic teachings of
[00:19:15.920 --> 00:19:19.120]   the book of Philippians comes in chapter 2 when he talks about,
[00:19:19.120 --> 00:19:22.320]   he says, "Make my joy complete by being of the,"
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:23.920]   you hear?
[00:19:23.920 --> 00:19:31.120]   "Same mind, same love, same united spirit intent on one purpose."
[00:19:31.120 --> 00:19:31.920]   Okay?
[00:19:31.920 --> 00:19:33.920]   And that's in chapter 2.
[00:19:33.920 --> 00:19:37.420]   So, there's that kind of danger,
[00:19:37.420 --> 00:19:39.420]   and then there's also the danger that you see
[00:19:39.820 --> 00:19:41.420]   of Apostle Paul warning them,
[00:19:41.420 --> 00:19:43.120]   "Beware of the dogs.
[00:19:43.120 --> 00:19:47.920]   Those who are evil workers, beware of the false circumcision."
[00:19:47.920 --> 00:19:51.920]   So, we are talking about those individuals who are advocating.
[00:19:51.920 --> 00:19:54.220]   The Judaizers advocating,
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:19:57.020]   "Follow us in real holiness."
[00:19:57.020 --> 00:20:01.220]   You know? "When you follow these rituals and when you follow these commands,
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.520]   you shall be righteous."
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.920]   That is the teaching of, you know, like a works-based religion.
[00:20:05.920 --> 00:20:07.220]   Okay.
[00:20:08.720 --> 00:20:11.520]   I just wanted to mention that briefly, just to share with you.
[00:20:11.520 --> 00:20:14.720]   We have now kind of an overview of,
[00:20:14.720 --> 00:20:16.420]   these are the recipients,
[00:20:16.420 --> 00:20:20.820]   and notice how we didn't have to stretch far and wide to get all the details.
[00:20:20.820 --> 00:20:23.920]   We just paid closely attention to what was already in the book.
[00:20:23.920 --> 00:20:24.620]   Right?
[00:20:24.620 --> 00:20:29.820]   Now, here is the next question that helps us transition along to the next point.
[00:20:29.820 --> 00:20:32.020]   And the next question is, okay,
[00:20:32.020 --> 00:20:35.020]   Apostle Paul is super thankful and joyous.
[00:20:35.220 --> 00:20:37.520]   He's super thankful and joyous because
[00:20:37.520 --> 00:20:40.220]   these individuals are engaged in the gospel ministry,
[00:20:40.220 --> 00:20:42.320]   these individuals are generous to him,
[00:20:42.320 --> 00:20:45.120]   and clearly, they've responded to this gospel, right?
[00:20:45.120 --> 00:20:48.020]   However, there is still a danger of disunity,
[00:20:48.020 --> 00:20:49.820]   there's still a danger of false teaching.
[00:20:49.820 --> 00:20:54.820]   The next question is, how is he going to address these issues?
[00:20:54.820 --> 00:21:00.420]   There is a spurring, typically a reason why somebody writes the letter.
[00:21:00.420 --> 00:21:01.320]   Right?
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:03.520]   You feel like, "Oh man,
[00:21:04.120 --> 00:21:05.320]   I gotta say something."
[00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:06.120]   Right?
[00:21:06.120 --> 00:21:08.220]   Something that's an impetus for that letter.
[00:21:08.220 --> 00:21:10.920]   And likewise, typically when Apostle Paul writes,
[00:21:10.920 --> 00:21:12.520]   it's really clear.
[00:21:12.520 --> 00:21:14.720]   He has a lot of statements like,
[00:21:14.720 --> 00:21:16.220]   "I'm doing this so that..."
[00:21:16.220 --> 00:21:19.520]   "I'm praying for you this..."
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:20.820]   Right?
[00:21:20.820 --> 00:21:23.720]   And a lot of times those things, the "so that's,"
[00:21:23.720 --> 00:21:26.020]   the "therefore's," "I'm praying this,"
[00:21:26.020 --> 00:21:28.320]   will kind of tell you, "This is my intention,
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   this is the purpose of why I wrote the letter."
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:31.020]   Okay?
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:33.720]   So this is the way I'm going to present it to you.
[00:21:34.420 --> 00:21:35.620]   And I want to challenge you.
[00:21:35.620 --> 00:21:39.020]   Don't think, please don't think,
[00:21:39.020 --> 00:21:41.020]   that there is one right answer
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:43.020]   when someone says, "What's the purpose of the letter?"
[00:21:43.020 --> 00:21:44.720]   There's like one singular thing.
[00:21:44.720 --> 00:21:47.820]   There can be various things that Apostle Paul writes.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:49.420]   But I want to challenge you,
[00:21:49.420 --> 00:21:50.420]   please,
[00:21:50.420 --> 00:21:52.720]   when you do an overview study,
[00:21:52.720 --> 00:21:54.920]   or even when you're thinking about a paragraph,
[00:21:54.920 --> 00:21:58.620]   think about how you can summarize that into a purpose statement.
[00:21:58.620 --> 00:22:00.320]   The reason why is because,
[00:22:00.320 --> 00:22:01.520]   as you do that,
[00:22:01.920 --> 00:22:05.520]   you start thinking about the author's intent
[00:22:05.520 --> 00:22:06.620]   for the reader.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:07.720]   Right?
[00:22:07.720 --> 00:22:10.320]   And that's vastly important.
[00:22:10.320 --> 00:22:12.920]   We're not asking the question,
[00:22:12.920 --> 00:22:14.520]   like immediately,
[00:22:14.520 --> 00:22:15.120]   "Okay,
[00:22:15.120 --> 00:22:17.920]   how is this in any way relevant to me?"
[00:22:17.920 --> 00:22:19.520]   That's a bad starting point.
[00:22:19.520 --> 00:22:21.420]   The best starting point is,
[00:22:21.420 --> 00:22:26.320]   "What does this author hope to accomplish by writing this?"
[00:22:26.320 --> 00:22:27.220]   Yes?
[00:22:27.220 --> 00:22:29.220]   And so asking this question of,
[00:22:29.220 --> 00:22:30.720]   "What's the purpose? What's the goal?
[00:22:30.920 --> 00:22:32.120]   Who is he addressing?
[00:22:32.120 --> 00:22:35.020]   And what does he want to actually speak into?"
[00:22:35.020 --> 00:22:37.820]   Those are super, super crucial, as you guys know.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:38.920]   Okay.
[00:22:38.920 --> 00:22:40.220]   So,
[00:22:40.220 --> 00:22:43.220]   I've got some blanks for you there in this little mini paragraph.
[00:22:43.220 --> 00:22:45.020]   And what I wrote is this.
[00:22:45.020 --> 00:22:46.120]   The goal is
[00:22:46.120 --> 00:22:49.620]   to have true joy through faith in Christ.
[00:22:49.620 --> 00:22:51.720]   Okay? True joy and faith through Christ,
[00:22:51.720 --> 00:22:55.420]   so that they can continue to fellowship in the gospel of Christ,
[00:22:55.420 --> 00:22:57.020]   living in unity
[00:22:57.020 --> 00:23:00.420]   for the sake of Christ's glory and his gospel.
[00:23:01.020 --> 00:23:01.520]   Okay?
[00:23:01.520 --> 00:23:03.920]   Hope you got all the blanks there.
[00:23:03.920 --> 00:23:06.520]   Now, as you see that, you might be like,
[00:23:06.520 --> 00:23:07.620]   "Okay,
[00:23:07.620 --> 00:23:09.020]   that paragraph
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.020]   sounds like a lot of the kind of big,
[00:23:12.020 --> 00:23:15.020]   you know, kind of over-generalizations,
[00:23:15.020 --> 00:23:16.020]   that kind of stuff.
[00:23:16.020 --> 00:23:18.020]   So what we're going to do now is break it down.
[00:23:18.020 --> 00:23:20.520]   And I'm going to skip this little paragraph from MacArthur.
[00:23:20.520 --> 00:23:22.820]   I just pulled it from his study Bible because I liked it.
[00:23:22.820 --> 00:23:26.120]   He pointed out various purposes that he saw.
[00:23:26.120 --> 00:23:28.220]   And so I just liked it and put it there for you.
[00:23:28.220 --> 00:23:30.320]   But the way I want to break it down is this.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   The first element of that was to have joy through faith in Christ.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:37.420]   And that's really evident here.
[00:23:37.420 --> 00:23:40.220]   Philippians 1, verse 25-26.
[00:23:40.220 --> 00:23:41.220]   Okay?
[00:23:41.220 --> 00:23:43.220]   He says, "Convinced of this,
[00:23:43.220 --> 00:23:44.320]   I know
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.620]   that I will remain and continue with you all for
[00:23:47.620 --> 00:23:49.120]   your progress
[00:23:49.120 --> 00:23:51.020]   and joy in the faith."
[00:23:51.020 --> 00:23:54.120]   Remember, in this context, the Apostle Paul says, "You know what?
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:56.720]   For me to live as Christ,
[00:23:56.720 --> 00:23:57.620]   die is gain."
[00:23:57.620 --> 00:23:58.620]   Right?
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:23:59.920]   And as a matter of fact,
[00:24:00.020 --> 00:24:02.220]   if you were to ask me honestly, what do I prefer?
[00:24:02.220 --> 00:24:05.020]   I would prefer to be with my Lord Jesus.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.220]   Why do I stay?
[00:24:07.220 --> 00:24:10.120]   That is a question of purpose.
[00:24:10.120 --> 00:24:12.020]   A question of intent.
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:15.520]   And what he says is, "I am staying, I am remaining
[00:24:15.520 --> 00:24:17.320]   so that you will progress
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.620]   and that
[00:24:18.620 --> 00:24:21.120]   you may have joy in the faith."
[00:24:21.120 --> 00:24:21.920]   Okay?
[00:24:21.920 --> 00:24:23.720]   So that's absolutely important right there.
[00:24:23.720 --> 00:24:24.920]   Next,
[00:24:24.920 --> 00:24:27.520]   Philippians 3, verse 1 says, "Finally, brethren,
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:29.620]   rejoice in the Lord.
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:34.820]   To write the same thing again is no trouble to me and it is a safeguard for you.
[00:24:34.820 --> 00:24:39.520]   For for rejoicing the Lord always, again, I say, rejoice!"
[00:24:39.520 --> 00:24:40.820]   Okay?
[00:24:40.820 --> 00:24:45.720]   Remember that whenever you guys are doing your Bible studies, repetition is key.
[00:24:45.720 --> 00:24:47.720]   And anything emphatic where he,
[00:24:47.720 --> 00:24:49.620]   in that same phrase,
[00:24:49.620 --> 00:24:52.120]   whether he repeats it in a nuanced way,
[00:24:52.120 --> 00:24:55.320]   here he's just like, "Rejoice! You know what? I'll say it again!"
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:55.820]   Right?
[00:24:55.820 --> 00:24:57.420]   "You better rejoice!"
[00:24:58.020 --> 00:24:59.920]   I mean, think about his purpose
[00:24:59.920 --> 00:25:01.520]   for you
[00:25:01.520 --> 00:25:03.320]   to delight in the Lord.
[00:25:03.320 --> 00:25:04.520]   Right?
[00:25:04.520 --> 00:25:08.720]   For the Philippians to have that kind of appreciation
[00:25:08.720 --> 00:25:12.520]   where their joy comes
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:15.820]   not simply because they were safe,
[00:25:15.820 --> 00:25:19.320]   not simply because, "Oh, now I know what I'm doing in life.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:21.520]   I found some reason and I've got some purpose."
[00:25:21.520 --> 00:25:22.220]   No, no, no.
[00:25:22.220 --> 00:25:27.920]   He desires them to rejoice in the Savior, the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:25:28.920 --> 00:25:29.720]   Moving forward,
[00:25:29.720 --> 00:25:33.820]   he mentions how he desires for them to fellowship with him
[00:25:33.820 --> 00:25:36.920]   in his suffering for the greater progress of the gospel.
[00:25:36.920 --> 00:25:39.720]   So if you notice in the previous paragraph, I said
[00:25:39.720 --> 00:25:43.520]   to have true joy so that they can continue in the fellowship of the gospel.
[00:25:43.520 --> 00:25:46.220]   That part of it is huge.
[00:25:46.220 --> 00:25:47.420]   For example,
[00:25:47.420 --> 00:25:50.220]   verse 12 through 14, we talked about how
[00:25:50.220 --> 00:25:54.920]   you know, there is this greater progress of the gospel and whatnot.
[00:25:54.920 --> 00:25:57.520]   And he says, "So that," and I'm going to start from verse 13,
[00:25:57.920 --> 00:25:59.320]   "that my imprisonment
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.520]   in the cause of Christ has become well known throughout the whole
[00:26:03.520 --> 00:26:05.920]   Praetorian Guard and to everyone else,
[00:26:05.920 --> 00:26:09.620]   and that most of the brethren trusting in the Lord because of my imprisonment
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.420]   have far more courage to speak the Word of God without fear."
[00:26:14.420 --> 00:26:15.320]   Okay?
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:18.920]   What's more, I want to highlight for you Philippians 3
[00:26:18.920 --> 00:26:21.520]   and jump down over to verse 16.
[00:26:21.520 --> 00:26:22.920]   He says, "However,
[00:26:22.920 --> 00:26:25.020]   let us keep living
[00:26:25.020 --> 00:26:27.220]   by that same standard
[00:26:27.520 --> 00:26:30.120]   to which we have attained. Brethren,
[00:26:30.120 --> 00:26:32.920]   join in following my example."
[00:26:32.920 --> 00:26:34.620]   Reminder, where is he?
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:37.220]   In prison, right?
[00:26:37.220 --> 00:26:40.520]   I want you guys to think about that for a moment.
[00:26:40.520 --> 00:26:45.220]   Apostle Paul commends them for being partners with him in the gospel,
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:46.920]   but he desires
[00:26:46.920 --> 00:26:49.820]   that that fellowship will continue.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:50.820]   Right?
[00:26:50.820 --> 00:26:52.120]   "Join me.
[00:26:52.120 --> 00:26:53.820]   Keep going."
[00:26:53.820 --> 00:26:56.620]   In this previous paragraph, he talks about how
[00:26:56.820 --> 00:26:58.520]   we haven't reached the end, you guys.
[00:26:58.520 --> 00:27:02.020]   We put back the stuff behind, the suffering,
[00:27:02.020 --> 00:27:03.320]   the persecutions.
[00:27:03.320 --> 00:27:06.120]   We lay the prize ahead of us and we just keep going.
[00:27:06.120 --> 00:27:08.120]   We persevere.
[00:27:08.120 --> 00:27:09.420]   That's the idea.
[00:27:09.420 --> 00:27:12.020]   And if you think about Apostle Paul and his joy,
[00:27:12.020 --> 00:27:15.520]   man, he is truly, truly set
[00:27:15.520 --> 00:27:18.520]   when he sees the gospel going forth,
[00:27:18.520 --> 00:27:22.620]   when he sees the ministry of Christ having its powerful effect,
[00:27:22.620 --> 00:27:24.120]   he says, "Man, I'm living.
[00:27:24.120 --> 00:27:25.820]   I'm so happy."
[00:27:25.820 --> 00:27:26.520]   Right?
[00:27:27.220 --> 00:27:29.520]   So for Apostle Paul, that's his perspective.
[00:27:29.520 --> 00:27:31.120]   Now, moving forward,
[00:27:31.120 --> 00:27:32.620]   there's a couple more things.
[00:27:32.620 --> 00:27:34.320]   He says, "To unify the church
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:36.920]   and have them walk worthy of Christ."
[00:27:36.920 --> 00:27:40.820]   I want to take a moment to mention this idea again.
[00:27:40.820 --> 00:27:44.420]   He says, "Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ,
[00:27:44.420 --> 00:27:46.820]   if there's any consolation of love,
[00:27:46.820 --> 00:27:48.920]   if there's any fellowship of spirit,
[00:27:48.920 --> 00:27:54.020]   any affection and compassion, make my joy complete by being of the same mind,
[00:27:54.020 --> 00:27:56.120]   maintaining the same love,
[00:27:56.320 --> 00:28:00.720]   united in spirit, intent on one purpose."
[00:28:00.720 --> 00:28:04.320]   Your unity as a church
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:08.020]   is not just because unity in of itself is,
[00:28:08.020 --> 00:28:09.420]   "Oh, it's so beautiful."
[00:28:09.420 --> 00:28:10.320]   Right?
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:16.620]   There was a moment in time when a lot of people were just enamored with the flowery thought
[00:28:16.620 --> 00:28:21.920]   that if we had a multicultural church with all kinds of nationalities,
[00:28:21.920 --> 00:28:24.820]   that in of itself would just be a beautiful thing.
[00:28:25.720 --> 00:28:26.620]   Can I say something?
[00:28:26.620 --> 00:28:30.620]   That in of itself doesn't have much weight.
[00:28:30.620 --> 00:28:32.520]   Why?
[00:28:32.520 --> 00:28:38.220]   Because that kind of harmony should be for the sake of Christ's glory.
[00:28:38.220 --> 00:28:40.720]   When we join together,
[00:28:40.720 --> 00:28:43.920]   not because we had the power to make something beautiful,
[00:28:43.920 --> 00:28:49.020]   but when we join together despite the differences because of the power of Jesus,
[00:28:49.020 --> 00:28:53.520]   where in Christ there is no longer Jew or Greek,
[00:28:54.320 --> 00:28:58.020]   in Christ there is no longer woman or man, free or slave,
[00:28:58.020 --> 00:29:00.320]   but Christ is in all.
[00:29:00.320 --> 00:29:01.320]   Right?
[00:29:01.320 --> 00:29:06.020]   When he becomes all in all, he becomes glorified.
[00:29:06.020 --> 00:29:09.720]   Our unity speaks to God's glory,
[00:29:09.720 --> 00:29:14.620]   the power that belongs to God to make us one body,
[00:29:14.620 --> 00:29:16.820]   and that in the name of Christ.
[00:29:16.820 --> 00:29:22.720]   And so that's why Apostle Paul cares whether two ladies get together in the church.
[00:29:22.720 --> 00:29:23.220]   Right?
[00:29:23.520 --> 00:29:28.520]   And that's why Apostle Paul cares that the church stay united to that cause and purpose.
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:29.720]   And so,
[00:29:29.720 --> 00:29:32.620]   here in Philippians 127, he says,
[00:29:32.620 --> 00:29:36.420]   "Conduct yourselves in a manner worthy of the gospel of Christ,
[00:29:36.420 --> 00:29:39.920]   so that whether I come to see you or remain absent,
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:44.820]   I will hear of you that you are standing firm in one spirit, one mind,
[00:29:44.820 --> 00:29:48.820]   striving together for the faith of the gospel."
[00:29:48.820 --> 00:29:50.320]   Right?
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:52.620]   For the faith of the gospel.
[00:29:53.220 --> 00:29:53.720]   Okay.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:55.120]   So,
[00:29:55.120 --> 00:29:58.120]   we covered, this is the general tone,
[00:29:58.120 --> 00:30:00.520]   these are the people he's writing to,
[00:30:00.520 --> 00:30:03.920]   and then we covered, this is the way he's going to address them.
[00:30:03.920 --> 00:30:04.920]   Right?
[00:30:04.920 --> 00:30:08.620]   He's going to address, yes, their participation,
[00:30:08.620 --> 00:30:13.720]   yes, their generosity, but also the danger of disunity and bad teaching.
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:17.720]   The last part then is, what is the emphatic teaching that you should take home?
[00:30:17.720 --> 00:30:19.320]   Right? I asked this question,
[00:30:19.320 --> 00:30:24.220]   what is the major theme and teaching that you should draw from this?
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.120]   Now, I just want to say again, there isn't just like,
[00:30:27.120 --> 00:30:28.720]   there's just one thing you have to get,
[00:30:28.720 --> 00:30:30.720]   like, there's a lot he says.
[00:30:30.720 --> 00:30:32.720]   Okay? You don't have to get overly concerned like,
[00:30:32.720 --> 00:30:34.220]   "Oh gosh, I missed it." You know?
[00:30:34.220 --> 00:30:38.420]   Every time, sometimes, I'm not doing any audience participation today,
[00:30:38.420 --> 00:30:40.520]   but I can sense like some people,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:44.620]   I give a really obvious question and they're afraid to answer, you know?
[00:30:44.620 --> 00:30:48.220]   Because what if I'm looking for a specific answer and I don't get that one thing?
[00:30:48.720 --> 00:30:51.920]   Well, remember, there's a lot of things Apostle Paul says in this book,
[00:30:51.920 --> 00:30:57.120]   but one of the main repeated and both emphatic teaching
[00:30:57.120 --> 00:31:02.920]   is that we who are genuinely in faith should be rejoicing in Christ.
[00:31:02.920 --> 00:31:04.020]   Okay?
[00:31:04.020 --> 00:31:08.620]   If we missed that, then yes, we would have missed the repeated and emphatic teaching
[00:31:08.620 --> 00:31:10.020]   that Apostle Paul says.
[00:31:10.020 --> 00:31:16.920]   Apostle Paul is talking about having such a joy in Christ
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:19.220]   that remember, where is he?
[00:31:19.220 --> 00:31:21.220]   In prison.
[00:31:21.220 --> 00:31:25.620]   So far, he has been beaten multiple times.
[00:31:25.620 --> 00:31:27.120]   He's been chased out of cities.
[00:31:27.120 --> 00:31:30.320]   It's not as though this was the first city he visited.
[00:31:30.320 --> 00:31:34.720]   He is already long, long into many sufferings.
[00:31:34.720 --> 00:31:38.920]   And he says, "I am overjoyed."
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:42.020]   In chapter 4, it says, "I have rejoiced."
[00:31:42.020 --> 00:31:46.320]   He finds that eternal and external joy
[00:31:46.320 --> 00:31:48.820]   that doesn't come from within his self.
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:52.520]   He doesn't look at the situation and say, "Well, look at the bright side.
[00:31:52.520 --> 00:31:54.120]   There's a nice guy watching me."
[00:31:54.120 --> 00:31:56.020]   Like, he doesn't look at the scenario.
[00:31:56.020 --> 00:31:57.920]   He is looking to Christ.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:02.520]   And when he does that, he uses lots of synonymous or linked ideas
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:04.320]   to this idea of rejoicing.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:07.820]   He talks about not only joy but contentment, right?
[00:32:07.820 --> 00:32:10.920]   He talks about peace that surpasses everything.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.520]   He talks about a kind of confidence because guess what?
[00:32:13.520 --> 00:32:16.620]   When you're rejoicing in Christ, you will have confidence.
[00:32:16.620 --> 00:32:18.420]   You'll be clear about who you are.
[00:32:18.420 --> 00:32:20.420]   You'll be clear about your security.
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.020]   He talks about having abundance, having riches, right?
[00:32:25.020 --> 00:32:30.820]   Those are all the lens of really seeing in faith who you have,
[00:32:30.820 --> 00:32:33.120]   the person of Jesus Christ.
[00:32:33.120 --> 00:32:36.420]   And so, one of the things I want to highlight for you
[00:32:36.420 --> 00:32:40.320]   is Philippians chapter 3, verses 20 to 21, where he says,
[00:32:40.320 --> 00:32:44.920]   "Our citizenship is in heaven, from which also we eagerly await
[00:32:44.920 --> 00:32:49.520]   a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ, who will transform the body
[00:32:49.520 --> 00:32:54.320]   of our humble state into conformity with the body of his glory."
[00:32:54.320 --> 00:32:55.620]   Right?
[00:32:55.620 --> 00:32:56.820]   The body of his glory.
[00:32:56.820 --> 00:33:00.220]   "By the exertion of the power that he has even to subject
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.120]   all things to himself."
[00:33:02.120 --> 00:33:05.620]   I want to conclude by highlighting that a little bit, okay?
[00:33:06.520 --> 00:33:11.520]   That Apostle Paul desires these individuals to grow
[00:33:11.520 --> 00:33:15.720]   in their expansive understanding of faith in Jesus Christ.
[00:33:15.720 --> 00:33:18.720]   This is the way I would like us to think about it, okay?
[00:33:18.720 --> 00:33:22.220]   Apostle Paul is talking to a fairly mature church, right?
[00:33:22.220 --> 00:33:23.320]   Because why?
[00:33:23.320 --> 00:33:25.020]   They're already engaged in ministry.
[00:33:25.020 --> 00:33:28.420]   Apostle Paul is talking to a fairly mature church, right?
[00:33:28.420 --> 00:33:29.720]   Because they're already generous.
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:32.120]   And he says, "You guys already know how to love each other."
[00:33:32.720 --> 00:33:36.620]   When I think about that, I'm thinking, you know, my honest
[00:33:36.620 --> 00:33:40.820]   perspective is that here at this church, we have a lot of people
[00:33:40.820 --> 00:33:44.320]   who are eager to serve, who are eager to be generous, and they're
[00:33:44.320 --> 00:33:47.720]   looking for opportunities to engage the ministry of God.
[00:33:47.720 --> 00:33:49.520]   That's my honest opinion, okay?
[00:33:49.520 --> 00:33:55.720]   But Apostle Paul wants them to grow even more, right?
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:33:58.620]   He's taking a church that's already encouraging and says,
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:00.320]   "I want you to have even more.
[00:34:00.520 --> 00:34:03.920]   I want you to have more knowledge, more discernment, more love.
[00:34:03.920 --> 00:34:07.820]   I want you to have greater faith, a persevering engagement in ministry.
[00:34:07.820 --> 00:34:12.220]   I want you to take up the suffering that I call grace, right?
[00:34:12.220 --> 00:34:14.620]   I want you to take this up and join me."
[00:34:14.620 --> 00:34:18.020]   He's encouraging this church to do more.
[00:34:18.020 --> 00:34:19.620]   How do you do that?
[00:34:19.620 --> 00:34:21.520]   Right?
[00:34:21.520 --> 00:34:24.620]   How do you take people who are already at a certain level and
[00:34:24.620 --> 00:34:25.920]   push them to do more?
[00:34:25.920 --> 00:34:30.120]   Do you say, "Okay, guys, we're about ready to get, you know, even
[00:34:30.120 --> 00:34:33.820]   deeper into our work, so let's first take a break, you know?
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:36.520]   Okay, what we need is more practical training."
[00:34:36.520 --> 00:34:42.820]   No, he says, "What I would like to see in you is an unmovable,
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:48.920]   standing firm joy in Christ that'll motivate you in no matter what
[00:34:48.920 --> 00:34:49.920]   circumstance you're in.
[00:34:49.920 --> 00:34:55.920]   You are not going to find joy by looking at your feeble, humble
[00:34:55.920 --> 00:34:56.620]   flesh.
[00:34:57.220 --> 00:35:00.120]   You're not going to find joy by looking at this world.
[00:35:00.120 --> 00:35:02.520]   You're not going to find joy by looking at other people.
[00:35:02.520 --> 00:35:05.220]   You can't look anywhere else.
[00:35:05.220 --> 00:35:10.620]   Especially if you are desiring to grow above and beyond where you
[00:35:10.620 --> 00:35:13.020]   are now, you feel like you've walked your Christian life to a
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.620]   certain degree, you've been living the Christian life for many
[00:35:15.620 --> 00:35:17.620]   years, and you desire to grow more.
[00:35:17.620 --> 00:35:20.020]   You can't look anywhere else.
[00:35:20.020 --> 00:35:25.620]   You have to look to Christ and eagerly, eagerly desire the Savior
[00:35:26.020 --> 00:35:30.820]   who is going to exercise His power and share with us His glory."
[00:35:30.820 --> 00:35:33.820]   That's pretty amazing stuff.
[00:35:33.820 --> 00:35:39.520]   And that lens, that spiritual phenomena of having your faith
[00:35:39.520 --> 00:35:43.120]   not be based on your sight, like, "I can't see, you know, I can't
[00:35:43.120 --> 00:35:44.720]   see why I should be happy in this.
[00:35:44.720 --> 00:35:46.120]   Where's the silver lining?"
[00:35:46.120 --> 00:35:46.620]   Right?
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:48.320]   It's seen through your faith.
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:53.520]   When that happens, God is going to radically empower us to go
[00:35:53.520 --> 00:35:55.820]   above and beyond what we think is even capable.
[00:35:56.020 --> 00:35:56.520]   Right?
[00:35:56.520 --> 00:36:00.120]   So I wanted to challenge you with that because there are a lot
[00:36:00.120 --> 00:36:03.420]   of other teaching and themes that I'm not going to cover today,
[00:36:03.420 --> 00:36:09.120]   but all of those things are going to be empowered by a steadfast
[00:36:09.120 --> 00:36:10.220]   joy in Christ.
[00:36:10.220 --> 00:36:10.720]   Amen?
[00:36:10.720 --> 00:36:12.020]   Amen.
[00:36:12.020 --> 00:36:13.020]   All right.
[00:36:13.020 --> 00:36:17.020]   Now, what I'd like to do before I pray is just share with you
[00:36:17.020 --> 00:36:20.420]   that A, there is some optional further study.
[00:36:20.420 --> 00:36:23.620]   At the end of each study, because it's a short amount of time,
[00:36:23.620 --> 00:36:26.220]   I went only for about 30 minutes here, 31 minutes.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:29.620]   Can't cover everything, but what I'd like to just challenge you
[00:36:29.620 --> 00:36:34.620]   to do is read Acts 16 and 2 Corinthians 8 to get a feel for
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.120]   like, when did this happen?
[00:36:36.120 --> 00:36:37.720]   What was Apostle Paul doing?
[00:36:37.720 --> 00:36:38.420]   Where was he?
[00:36:38.420 --> 00:36:38.920]   Right?
[00:36:38.920 --> 00:36:42.720]   The other thing I'd like to challenge you to do is as you
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:46.620]   read this book multiple times, yes, you're going to start
[00:36:46.620 --> 00:36:49.020]   feeling, you're going to feel the tone.
[00:36:49.020 --> 00:36:51.620]   You're going to start sensing like, "Oh, this is what he's
[00:36:51.620 --> 00:36:52.620]   trying to address."
[00:36:52.620 --> 00:36:57.320]   But also, I want you to be able to follow his flow of thought.
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.320]   Apostle Paul is an incredibly methodical, because he's being
[00:37:01.320 --> 00:37:02.320]   inspired, right?
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:06.320]   The teacher in the sense that he's leading us from point to
[00:37:06.320 --> 00:37:06.820]   point.
[00:37:06.820 --> 00:37:09.720]   And a lot of times, outlining will help you actually follow
[00:37:09.720 --> 00:37:12.820]   his trail, and it'll help you summarize and therefore remember.
[00:37:12.820 --> 00:37:13.420]   Okay?
[00:37:13.420 --> 00:37:17.120]   And then, lastly is next week, we're going to be studying
[00:37:17.120 --> 00:37:19.020]   chapter 1, verse 3 through 11.
[00:37:19.620 --> 00:37:23.420]   So please make sure to try to jot down as many observations
[00:37:23.420 --> 00:37:26.620]   as you can, even if you're like, "But this is obvious.
[00:37:26.620 --> 00:37:27.920]   I don't need to say it."
[00:37:27.920 --> 00:37:30.620]   Yes, you do, because observation is just that.
[00:37:30.620 --> 00:37:33.820]   You write down and notice the stuff that's there.
[00:37:33.820 --> 00:37:35.520]   And then you start asking questions.
[00:37:35.520 --> 00:37:36.220]   What does this mean?
[00:37:36.220 --> 00:37:37.020]   How does this connect?
[00:37:37.020 --> 00:37:37.720]   Why is that there?
[00:37:37.720 --> 00:37:38.520]   That kind of stuff.
[00:37:38.520 --> 00:37:39.020]   Okay?
[00:37:39.020 --> 00:37:39.920]   All right.
[00:37:39.920 --> 00:37:42.620]   Then let me take a moment to pray, and then you guys can
[00:37:42.620 --> 00:37:45.520]   have rest of the evening too, fellowship by discussing about
[00:37:45.520 --> 00:37:46.920]   the application questions.
[00:37:46.920 --> 00:37:47.520]   Let's pray.
[00:37:48.020 --> 00:37:50.820]   God, we want to thank you so much.
[00:37:50.820 --> 00:37:56.920]   Lord, it's pretty incredible because, Lord, you're the one
[00:37:56.920 --> 00:38:01.220]   who is offering to us this sweet joy, freely.
[00:38:01.220 --> 00:38:06.720]   And God, this sweet joy is not conditioned upon life
[00:38:06.720 --> 00:38:07.820]   circumstances.
[00:38:07.820 --> 00:38:11.720]   God, it's not conditioned upon my limitations.
[00:38:11.720 --> 00:38:17.620]   Father God, the joy that you offer us is tantamount to your
[00:38:17.620 --> 00:38:21.720]   eternal character, because Lord, the offer you give is to have
[00:38:21.720 --> 00:38:22.020]   you.
[00:38:22.020 --> 00:38:26.820]   So God, we want to thank you, and we pray that our eyes of
[00:38:26.820 --> 00:38:28.220]   faith would look to you.
[00:38:28.220 --> 00:38:32.920]   And what's more, realize, God, that our joy is steadfast
[00:38:32.920 --> 00:38:36.920]   because we are looking to an external joy given to us by
[00:38:36.920 --> 00:38:37.620]   your grace.
[00:38:37.620 --> 00:38:41.820]   And I pray, Father God, if there's people in the room who
[00:38:41.820 --> 00:38:46.220]   have been living lives of sadness and brokenness because
[00:38:46.220 --> 00:38:49.620]   they're looking at sin and they're looking at pain and looking
[00:38:49.620 --> 00:38:52.920]   at all kinds of brokenness in this world, I pray, God, that
[00:38:52.920 --> 00:38:56.720]   you'd grant to them greater faith in Christ, to look to our
[00:38:56.720 --> 00:39:01.820]   Savior and to trust his words, that God, you have all that
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:02.620]   we need and more.
[00:39:02.620 --> 00:39:03.720]   We thank you in Christ's name.
[00:39:03.720 --> 00:39:04.320]   Amen.
[00:39:04.320 --> 00:39:08.300]   [ Silence ]
