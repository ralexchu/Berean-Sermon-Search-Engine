[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:12.160]   Okay, so we're going to talk about how to help women that come in our life, that come
[00:00:12.160 --> 00:00:16.880]   to you and they say they're struggling with depression.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:23.280]   That's a really common, another common temptation that people have.
[00:00:23.280 --> 00:00:32.400]   And you know, some of my goals this afternoon will be to just talk about how, kind of identify
[00:00:32.400 --> 00:00:37.400]   some of the definition of depression from a biblical point of view.
[00:00:37.400 --> 00:00:41.680]   Even look at some people in the Bible that struggled with depression and how they actually
[00:00:41.680 --> 00:00:46.840]   can counsel themselves out of that and just some differing thoughts, schools of thoughts.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.360]   Now again, let me remind you, I'm not a psychologist.
[00:00:50.360 --> 00:00:54.920]   I'm a biblical counselor and so I'm not going to come from a psychologist point of view.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:58.560]   Some of you might have a psychologized view of this topic.
[00:00:58.560 --> 00:01:02.840]   You were taught that in school, but I don't hold to that school of thought.
[00:01:02.840 --> 00:01:08.760]   And so don't be offended if I give you the biblical view and it's contrary to what you've
[00:01:08.760 --> 00:01:12.080]   learned in school because there's just different schools of thought, right?
[00:01:12.080 --> 00:01:17.320]   Biblical counseling is still lumped into the psychologies because it's not just one psychology.
[00:01:17.320 --> 00:01:19.200]   It's like, it's a school of psychologies.
[00:01:19.200 --> 00:01:24.800]   There's differing thoughts and so I'm in the world of the biblical counseling psychologies.
[00:01:24.800 --> 00:01:27.480]   But anyway, let's just start with a big old quote.
[00:01:27.480 --> 00:01:28.920]   This is, this will get us started.
[00:01:28.920 --> 00:01:36.200]   This is Jay Adams again, the co-founder of biblical counseling, and he says that depression
[00:01:36.200 --> 00:01:39.920]   can all, almost anything can be at the root of depression.
[00:01:39.920 --> 00:01:44.480]   A person could have a recent illness in which they get behind in their work.
[00:01:44.480 --> 00:01:46.360]   There could be hormonal changes.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:48.960]   There could be a reversal of fortunes.
[00:01:48.960 --> 00:01:52.480]   There could be just the consequences of simple negligence.
[00:01:52.480 --> 00:01:59.280]   There could be guilt over a particular sin, self-pity arising from jealousy or maybe a
[00:01:59.280 --> 00:02:02.400]   disadvantageous turn of events.
[00:02:02.400 --> 00:02:07.040]   There could be bad feelings resulting from resentment and worry.
[00:02:07.040 --> 00:02:13.680]   Really the important factor or fact to remember is that depression does not result directly
[00:02:13.680 --> 00:02:19.880]   from any of those outside factors, but rather it comes from a cyclical process in which
[00:02:19.880 --> 00:02:27.320]   the initial problem, whatever that is, is mishandled in such a way that it is enlarged
[00:02:27.320 --> 00:02:31.960]   in a downward lexical spiral that eventually will plunge somebody into despair.
[00:02:31.960 --> 00:02:38.440]   So it's the way a person's responding to their circumstances and eventually it could potentially
[00:02:38.440 --> 00:02:39.940]   drive them to despair.
[00:02:39.940 --> 00:02:45.800]   And that downward cycle of sin moves from a problem to a faulty, sinful response, thereby
[00:02:45.800 --> 00:02:51.960]   causing an additional complicating problem which is met by an additional sinful response.
[00:02:51.960 --> 00:02:57.280]   So usually when people come and they present their problem as being depressed, there's
[00:02:57.280 --> 00:02:59.600]   usually other things going on in their life.
[00:02:59.600 --> 00:03:02.360]   That's usually not always the case.
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:07.400]   Depression can sometimes be just an effect of something they're responding to.
[00:03:07.400 --> 00:03:12.280]   Now because we live in a fallen world, it's just inevitable that life's going to bring
[00:03:12.280 --> 00:03:15.960]   hardship and suffering on one level or another.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:19.160]   I'm sure all of you might be struggling with things in your life.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:24.440]   I mean I had a student, it was just amazing, here we're going along in our semester, we've
[00:03:24.440 --> 00:03:29.200]   got two weeks to go, right now's the time where students are doing presentations, you
[00:03:29.200 --> 00:03:31.260]   know, the finals are coming up.
[00:03:31.260 --> 00:03:35.100]   And this poor girl over Easter break, her father died.
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:38.060]   Just like that, it was just very sudden.
[00:03:38.060 --> 00:03:39.200]   Things happen.
[00:03:39.200 --> 00:03:40.580]   We live in a fallen world.
[00:03:40.580 --> 00:03:44.400]   Death is part of being in the fallen world.
[00:03:44.400 --> 00:03:46.660]   And so she's dealing with that, right?
[00:03:46.660 --> 00:03:51.680]   She's having to deal with a sudden death of her father that she loved, of course, and
[00:03:51.680 --> 00:03:55.120]   trying not to allow it to drive her to despair.
[00:03:55.120 --> 00:04:02.780]   Now there's going to be obvious grief, but how do I keep from despairing without hope,
[00:04:02.780 --> 00:04:03.780]   you know?
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:06.500]   And so just kind of thinking through that.
[00:04:06.500 --> 00:04:12.580]   But depression has the potential to develop when setbacks in life, like what happened
[00:04:12.580 --> 00:04:16.580]   to my student, just aren't handled in a biblical and godly way.
[00:04:16.580 --> 00:04:20.840]   And as Jay Adams points out in that definition, is there's always a potential for it to become
[00:04:20.840 --> 00:04:25.380]   a downward spiral that will plunge us into despair if we allow it.
[00:04:25.380 --> 00:04:33.580]   So one of our goals this afternoon is to learn how we can hold to a high view of God in comparison
[00:04:33.580 --> 00:04:35.860]   to the trials that you experience.
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:42.060]   Because people are typically just responding to trials that they're trying to endure, and
[00:04:42.060 --> 00:04:46.700]   just remembering that God always brings great hope to believers when his grace is viewed
[00:04:46.700 --> 00:04:52.340]   as sufficient and his strength is viewed as real.
[00:04:52.340 --> 00:05:00.020]   Like David expresses in Psalm 42 and 43, that's a great two psalms that you can read that
[00:05:00.020 --> 00:05:02.500]   gives you focus.
[00:05:02.500 --> 00:05:07.660]   And it kind of helps you to view sorrow and suffering from God's perspective instead of
[00:05:07.660 --> 00:05:10.580]   just dealing with the emotion of it.
[00:05:10.580 --> 00:05:14.620]   So I think, again, what's helpful is just to kind of present a case study.
[00:05:14.620 --> 00:05:21.220]   I think it's helpful for you to kind of think through these issues by looking at a person.
[00:05:21.220 --> 00:05:26.980]   This particular case study comes out of the ACBC question that we use when we have our
[00:05:26.980 --> 00:05:30.420]   candidates take that exam.
[00:05:30.420 --> 00:05:37.420]   We want, so Esther will recognize this, so we want you to think through, I kind of changed
[00:05:37.420 --> 00:05:40.700]   some of the words, but it's basically the same one.
[00:05:40.700 --> 00:05:41.980]   And so just kind of follow along.
[00:05:41.980 --> 00:05:45.420]   I'm going to read the case study, and you just kind of think through this person's life
[00:05:45.420 --> 00:05:48.780]   as if it's someone you really know.
[00:05:48.780 --> 00:05:54.500]   And you're being asked, basically, by your pastor to come alongside this woman to help
[00:05:54.500 --> 00:05:55.500]   her, okay?
[00:05:55.580 --> 00:06:00.420]   So this is somebody that you're realizing, wow, this is going to be interesting.
[00:06:00.420 --> 00:06:02.860]   But here we have Sarah.
[00:06:02.860 --> 00:06:06.020]   And Sarah is a 34-year-old woman.
[00:06:06.020 --> 00:06:07.640]   She's a mother of three.
[00:06:07.640 --> 00:06:09.340]   So a lot of you are a mother of three.
[00:06:09.340 --> 00:06:11.340]   You can identify.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:16.300]   And she's come to you because she's been labeled as having depression.
[00:06:16.300 --> 00:06:18.620]   That's what she's telling you.
[00:06:18.620 --> 00:06:23.780]   She says that she's been feeling terribly sad for the last six months, and she's had
[00:06:23.780 --> 00:06:27.600]   a lot of trouble just keeping up with life.
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:33.380]   She wants to get to the bottom of this, and so she met with your pastor initially to get
[00:06:33.380 --> 00:06:38.740]   some counsel, or maybe she met with Esther initially to get some counsel, and they referred
[00:06:38.740 --> 00:06:43.980]   her to you because they're hoping that you might be able to give her wise counsel on
[00:06:43.980 --> 00:06:46.660]   what she should do, okay?
[00:06:46.660 --> 00:06:51.780]   And in addition to seeking your counsel, she also shares with you that she's already talked
[00:06:51.780 --> 00:06:57.340]   with a bunch of friends, and she's asking for their opinion as well, which isn't always
[00:06:57.340 --> 00:06:59.500]   very helpful, by the way.
[00:06:59.500 --> 00:07:01.180]   But that's what friends do.
[00:07:01.180 --> 00:07:06.020]   So she's asking her friends for help, and she says that a lot of her friends struggle
[00:07:06.020 --> 00:07:08.540]   in the same way.
[00:07:08.540 --> 00:07:14.940]   And so they said that what they did is they received antidepressants for their despair
[00:07:14.940 --> 00:07:21.460]   from their medical doctor to help with their issue, but they say they claim that the medicine
[00:07:21.460 --> 00:07:26.540]   seemed to help for a while, but they were beginning to experience some unpleasant side
[00:07:26.540 --> 00:07:30.400]   effects that Sarah's actually really concerned about.
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:35.220]   And so one of the questions she has for you is whether or not she should see her doctor
[00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:38.920]   about getting on antidepressants, okay?
[00:07:38.920 --> 00:07:41.860]   So we have a woman here, very common issue.
[00:07:41.860 --> 00:07:48.660]   This Sarah represents so many people that I've seen over the years, and she's describing
[00:07:48.660 --> 00:07:51.180]   something that women struggle with all over the country.
[00:07:51.180 --> 00:07:56.660]   So to address how to help her, if this were you and you were the person that needed to
[00:07:56.660 --> 00:08:02.660]   help this gal, I kind of want to just give you kind of a framework or a methodology that
[00:08:02.660 --> 00:08:03.660]   you could use.
[00:08:03.660 --> 00:08:05.780]   It's not, again, it's not rocket science.
[00:08:05.780 --> 00:08:12.180]   It's just careful study of people, wanting to ask questions to help them for the glory
[00:08:12.180 --> 00:08:13.180]   of God.
[00:08:13.180 --> 00:08:19.020]   And any of you could incorporate this into your own counsel.
[00:08:19.020 --> 00:08:22.740]   So it's always going to begin with asking good questions.
[00:08:22.740 --> 00:08:25.860]   You've got to ask people good questions or ask questions in general.
[00:08:25.860 --> 00:08:32.460]   You can't just assume that a person is a certain way just because you're making a judgment.
[00:08:32.460 --> 00:08:39.940]   James 119 says that we're to be quick to listen, quick to listen, slow to speak, right?
[00:08:39.940 --> 00:08:45.600]   And so if you want to be a compassionate and wise friend who gives good counsel, you need
[00:08:45.600 --> 00:08:50.940]   to make it your aim to seek to truly understand this woman that you're meeting with and just
[00:08:50.940 --> 00:08:55.620]   kind of begin to acquire knowledge before you pass any judgment on her.
[00:08:55.620 --> 00:09:01.860]   We see this played out in Proverbs 18.2, which says that a fool takes no pleasure in understanding
[00:09:01.860 --> 00:09:03.940]   but only in expressing his own opinion.
[00:09:03.940 --> 00:09:07.060]   So we don't, we want to get away from just expressing their own opinion.
[00:09:07.060 --> 00:09:12.020]   We actually want to give biblical counsel.
[00:09:12.020 --> 00:09:13.140]   I think it's just helpful.
[00:09:13.140 --> 00:09:18.300]   I kind of broke down the data gathering section into six categories.
[00:09:18.300 --> 00:09:20.980]   But before I go through this, I just want to make a disclaimer.
[00:09:20.980 --> 00:09:27.260]   I am not saying that you have to come up with 50 questions before you meet with anybody.
[00:09:27.260 --> 00:09:33.020]   This is just meant as a tool to kind of help you think through this a little more carefully.
[00:09:33.020 --> 00:09:37.180]   Everybody has their own style, but it is something that you've got to think through when someone
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:42.900]   comes to you and says, "Hey, I am really depressed and I'm despairing without hope."
[00:09:42.900 --> 00:09:46.860]   So the first thing that I'm going to look at is the physical data.
[00:09:46.860 --> 00:09:52.820]   You know, as a person who knows that I'm a body-soul person, like I've talked about before,
[00:09:52.820 --> 00:09:56.740]   I know that there might be something physical going on with this woman.
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:10:00.460]   And so I'm going to start asking her questions, like I'm going to start off and say, "How
[00:10:00.460 --> 00:10:02.380]   much sleep are you getting?"
[00:10:02.380 --> 00:10:04.740]   You know, it's not uncommon.
[00:10:04.740 --> 00:10:10.300]   How much sleep do you think the average college student gets?
[00:10:10.300 --> 00:10:11.860]   You guys laugh, right?
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:16.420]   Probably three, four hours maybe, especially when it's getting pretty heavy, if at all.
[00:10:16.420 --> 00:10:24.020]   But really, it's not a scientific fact, but overall they say that an adult should get
[00:10:24.020 --> 00:10:29.260]   seven to eight hours of sleep if you're between the ages of 18 to 64.
[00:10:29.260 --> 00:10:32.500]   And even a little bit less if you're older than that.
[00:10:32.500 --> 00:10:35.180]   So what kind of questions do I need to ask Sarah?
[00:10:35.180 --> 00:10:36.940]   Let's think about Sarah for a minute.
[00:10:36.940 --> 00:10:38.380]   What can I ask my friend?
[00:10:38.380 --> 00:10:40.940]   How much sleep are you getting?
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.860]   Are you getting enough?
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:45.060]   The story said that she has three children.
[00:10:45.060 --> 00:10:47.140]   How many of you have three or more children?
[00:10:47.140 --> 00:10:48.140]   Two or more children?
[00:10:48.140 --> 00:10:49.940]   My gosh, you know how that is.
[00:10:49.940 --> 00:10:51.980]   I would want to know, are you getting any sleep at all?
[00:10:51.980 --> 00:10:53.940]   You've got all these kids.
[00:10:53.940 --> 00:10:57.820]   Maybe she just had a baby, you know, and she's not getting any rest at all, right?
[00:10:57.820 --> 00:11:00.580]   Because she's up in the night.
[00:11:00.580 --> 00:11:03.780]   You know, or maybe all of these children, we don't know what their ages are.
[00:11:03.780 --> 00:11:07.620]   I don't know about you, but when I was having children, they were all like a year and a
[00:11:07.620 --> 00:11:08.620]   half apart.
[00:11:08.620 --> 00:11:13.540]   And so I had boom, boom, boom, and I wasn't getting a whole lot of sleep or a whole lot
[00:11:13.540 --> 00:11:14.540]   done.
[00:11:14.540 --> 00:11:17.660]   So, you know, it could be a situation like that.
[00:11:17.660 --> 00:11:21.180]   I might even ask Sarah how her diet's been, you know?
[00:11:21.180 --> 00:11:22.180]   What is she eating these days?
[00:11:22.180 --> 00:11:23.380]   Is she just barely surviving?
[00:11:23.380 --> 00:11:28.260]   Is she grabbing those, you know, fishy crackers as she's dealing with her kids and that's
[00:11:28.260 --> 00:11:29.260]   her lunch for the day?
[00:11:29.260 --> 00:11:32.700]   Or, you know, what's going on there?
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:36.260]   Could it be that she's eating the wrong things?
[00:11:36.260 --> 00:11:40.620]   For me personally, I know that when I have felt down in the dumps, when I've had those
[00:11:40.620 --> 00:11:45.460]   kind of emotions that I can't explain, I'll go to the doctor and I would tell Sarah the
[00:11:45.460 --> 00:11:46.460]   same.
[00:11:46.460 --> 00:11:48.940]   I'd say, "You need to go get a physical.
[00:11:48.940 --> 00:11:51.500]   That would probably be really important for you to do."
[00:11:51.500 --> 00:11:54.620]   But when I went, I had anemia.
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.300]   That's what was contributing to my depressed feelings.
[00:11:58.300 --> 00:12:01.460]   And so you've got to get those things checked out.
[00:12:01.460 --> 00:12:06.780]   And when you have lack of iron, if you've ever had that before, you have chronic fatigue,
[00:12:06.780 --> 00:12:07.780]   you know?
[00:12:07.780 --> 00:12:08.780]   And I was trying to figure out what's going on here?
[00:12:08.780 --> 00:12:10.040]   Why am I feeling that way?
[00:12:10.040 --> 00:12:13.520]   But it has an impact on your spiritual health.
[00:12:13.520 --> 00:12:16.820]   So it's not just the physical, but that was a big contributor.
[00:12:16.820 --> 00:12:20.980]   It had a potential to affect the spiritual.
[00:12:20.980 --> 00:12:24.940]   Maybe some other physical data you can think through is whether or not Sarah's getting
[00:12:24.940 --> 00:12:26.620]   enough physical activity.
[00:12:26.620 --> 00:12:30.140]   Maybe she's the kind of person that's too sedentary, right?
[00:12:30.140 --> 00:12:31.300]   She's not active enough.
[00:12:31.300 --> 00:12:32.420]   She's not getting out.
[00:12:32.420 --> 00:12:33.900]   She's not taking those kids out.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:39.180]   I was telling one of the students, or students, one of the ladies earlier that when my kids
[00:12:39.180 --> 00:12:41.660]   were little, I had to get them out, take them to the park.
[00:12:41.660 --> 00:12:43.140]   I was their first soccer coach.
[00:12:43.140 --> 00:12:47.900]   I mean, I had to do a lot of physical activities just to stay sane most of the time, being
[00:12:47.900 --> 00:12:50.300]   a young mom.
[00:12:50.300 --> 00:12:55.020]   But those are some things that we need to think through.
[00:12:55.020 --> 00:12:57.580]   What's causing?
[00:12:57.580 --> 00:12:58.580]   It's impacting.
[00:12:58.580 --> 00:13:00.300]   Let's say what's influencing.
[00:13:00.300 --> 00:13:03.940]   Another issue is maybe Sarah just has a medical problem.
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:09.260]   If you send her to the doctor for the physical, there are so many things out there that can
[00:13:09.260 --> 00:13:11.580]   contribute.
[00:13:11.580 --> 00:13:13.960]   Maybe some of you have thyroid issues.
[00:13:13.960 --> 00:13:17.740]   That can contribute to despairing feelings.
[00:13:17.740 --> 00:13:19.260]   People don't even realize that.
[00:13:19.260 --> 00:13:20.260]   It's a big contributor.
[00:13:20.260 --> 00:13:26.660]   It could just be something as simple as medical that a doctor can help fix.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:32.220]   And then suddenly you're like, "Wow, that's just not impacting me as much as I thought
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:33.220]   it would."
[00:13:33.220 --> 00:13:36.780]   Those are some questions you can ask Sarah on a physical level.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:40.180]   But the next one is resources, resource data.
[00:13:40.180 --> 00:13:45.300]   That's when you're trying to just understand where's Sarah even coming from?
[00:13:45.300 --> 00:13:46.420]   Is Sarah even a Christian?
[00:13:46.420 --> 00:13:48.180]   I don't know.
[00:13:48.180 --> 00:13:51.260]   So I need to sit down and I need to kind of talk through the gospel with her.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:56.540]   I mean, is she coming from a place of belief?
[00:13:56.540 --> 00:14:00.100]   Do I need to maybe go over the gospel with her if she's a Christian?
[00:14:00.100 --> 00:14:03.560]   Is she even integrated and interacting with the body of Christ?
[00:14:03.560 --> 00:14:06.900]   Because people that struggle with depression have a tendency to withdraw from the body
[00:14:06.900 --> 00:14:08.660]   of Christ.
[00:14:08.660 --> 00:14:10.260]   And that's a big issue.
[00:14:10.260 --> 00:14:14.460]   So it's important to know what's just going on with reference to her involvement in church
[00:14:14.460 --> 00:14:16.460]   or lack thereof.
[00:14:16.460 --> 00:14:20.820]   I worry about the people that are withdrawing because they usually start to feel lonely
[00:14:20.820 --> 00:14:25.140]   and it creates a lot of problems in that sense.
[00:14:25.140 --> 00:14:27.100]   They isolate too much.
[00:14:27.100 --> 00:14:32.340]   They get lonely and start to kind of get involved in a pity party.
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:34.340]   Emotional data.
[00:14:34.340 --> 00:14:39.940]   We need to know, you know, what kind of questions can I ask Sarah to help me to understand how
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:45.180]   she's responding to the circumstances in her life?
[00:14:45.180 --> 00:14:49.860]   In other words, you know, if I were to follow Sarah around with a tape recorder, I guess
[00:14:49.860 --> 00:14:57.820]   we wouldn't say tape recorder anymore, my iPhone, my MP3 player, if I were to follow
[00:14:57.820 --> 00:15:02.740]   her around and I played it back to her, what emotions would I hear?
[00:15:02.740 --> 00:15:03.740]   You know?
[00:15:03.740 --> 00:15:06.020]   I mean, really, how is she responding?
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:12.780]   And so the goal is to help her to kind of describe herself through those kinds of questions.
[00:15:12.780 --> 00:15:14.940]   And so am I really being slow to speak?
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:18.500]   Am I really listening to what she's saying?
[00:15:18.500 --> 00:15:21.940]   She said in her, in the case study that she's terribly sad.
[00:15:21.940 --> 00:15:23.140]   Why is she terribly sad?
[00:15:23.140 --> 00:15:24.140]   What is that all about?
[00:15:24.140 --> 00:15:25.140]   You know?
[00:15:25.140 --> 00:15:27.360]   Let me ask some questions about those things.
[00:15:27.360 --> 00:15:29.860]   Give me some more information.
[00:15:29.860 --> 00:15:32.420]   The fourth category is actions.
[00:15:32.420 --> 00:15:37.920]   This would be something that is kind of talking about what is Sarah doing and not doing?
[00:15:37.920 --> 00:15:46.000]   You know, is she not able to fulfill her responsibilities as a worker or as a wife or as a mom or whatever
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:48.440]   her context is?
[00:15:48.440 --> 00:15:52.540]   Because usually depression is an effect of not doing.
[00:15:52.540 --> 00:15:57.280]   So has she just gotten so overwhelmed now that she's just stopped doing everything?
[00:15:57.280 --> 00:16:00.440]   And that, the effect of that can be despairing feelings.
[00:16:00.440 --> 00:16:06.480]   And so I kind of want to know, what have you stopped doing?
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:11.280]   You know, you might even ask her questions pertaining to how she's even growing as a
[00:16:11.280 --> 00:16:12.280]   Christian.
[00:16:12.280 --> 00:16:14.840]   You know, has she stopped reading her Bible?
[00:16:14.840 --> 00:16:16.480]   Has she stopped going to Bible study?
[00:16:16.480 --> 00:16:18.200]   Things like that.
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:22.920]   Personal convictions data is important too because it has to do with just her attitude,
[00:16:22.920 --> 00:16:27.080]   her expectations, her desires, her values.
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:30.960]   You know, what kind of questions can I ask that will help me to understand Sarah better
[00:16:30.960 --> 00:16:31.960]   in this situation?
[00:16:31.960 --> 00:16:35.360]   I need to kind of understand what is she trusting?
[00:16:35.360 --> 00:16:38.400]   What is she, where is she really putting her trust?
[00:16:38.400 --> 00:16:39.960]   What is she fearing?
[00:16:39.960 --> 00:16:42.280]   What is she even listening to these days?
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.080]   You know, what is she reading?
[00:16:45.080 --> 00:16:46.080]   What is she serving?
[00:16:46.080 --> 00:16:50.080]   You know, what is her functional God?
[00:16:50.080 --> 00:16:55.080]   What does she see as the most pressing problem if I were to ask her in her life?
[00:16:55.080 --> 00:16:56.840]   Those kinds of things.
[00:16:56.840 --> 00:16:59.640]   The last thing would be historical data.
[00:16:59.640 --> 00:17:05.340]   I would want to know what kinds of questions, I would need to know past influencers.
[00:17:05.340 --> 00:17:06.340]   It's important.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:11.880]   I would say that our past influences us, but I don't hold to the nurture nature theory.
[00:17:11.880 --> 00:17:14.940]   It has an influence, but it shouldn't dictate.
[00:17:14.940 --> 00:17:19.280]   But it does have an influence, and so we would be foolish to say that it doesn't.
[00:17:19.280 --> 00:17:24.640]   And so I'd want to know what her past life context was, what her present life context
[00:17:24.640 --> 00:17:28.480]   is, what her external circumstances are.
[00:17:28.480 --> 00:17:30.760]   You know, stuff that she's currently experienced.
[00:17:30.760 --> 00:17:33.840]   Maybe someone has sinned against her, and that's the whole issue.
[00:17:33.840 --> 00:17:34.840]   Has she been sinned against?
[00:17:34.840 --> 00:17:37.040]   I mean, we haven't, it doesn't say anything about the husband.
[00:17:37.040 --> 00:17:38.880]   I don't even know the story there.
[00:17:38.880 --> 00:17:41.520]   You know, is there a husband?
[00:17:41.520 --> 00:17:42.520]   Is he being helpful?
[00:17:42.520 --> 00:17:43.520]   Is he not being helpful?
[00:17:43.520 --> 00:17:46.640]   You know, are there hardships?
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.360]   You know, maybe he's just left.
[00:17:48.360 --> 00:17:49.360]   Who knows?
[00:17:49.360 --> 00:17:50.920]   We have to ask.
[00:17:50.920 --> 00:17:56.040]   And so you have to ask those kinds of questions to discern, you know, what's going on in
[00:17:56.040 --> 00:17:57.640]   a person's life.
[00:17:57.640 --> 00:18:03.600]   You might also, we call it halo data, but you could just kind of tell from a person
[00:18:03.600 --> 00:18:08.400]   on the outside whether they're depressed or not, or at least despairing, because usually
[00:18:08.400 --> 00:18:10.240]   they look pretty disheveled.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:12.600]   They kind of have a what's-the-use attitude.
[00:18:12.600 --> 00:18:16.080]   They feel pretty hopeless.
[00:18:16.080 --> 00:18:17.240]   They cry easily.
[00:18:17.240 --> 00:18:19.120]   They sigh heavily.
[00:18:19.120 --> 00:18:20.560]   They look down a lot.
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:25.360]   I remember one counselee I had when I was working with her, she just looked down at
[00:18:25.360 --> 00:18:26.840]   the floor most of the time.
[00:18:26.840 --> 00:18:31.520]   Her hair was pretty much in her face, and it was just amazing to see how the Lord just
[00:18:31.520 --> 00:18:35.680]   transformed her life, and she just became this bright flower, you know, just to see
[00:18:35.680 --> 00:18:38.080]   her like on Facebook now in her life.
[00:18:38.080 --> 00:18:39.080]   It's just amazing.
[00:18:39.080 --> 00:18:41.200]   It doesn't even look like the same woman.
[00:18:41.200 --> 00:18:47.200]   But often they just seldom laugh, and they just are very, they just physically, they're
[00:18:47.200 --> 00:18:50.120]   just slow and lots of things.
[00:18:50.120 --> 00:18:53.880]   So again, you know, there are just so many people like Sarah in our churches who are
[00:18:53.880 --> 00:18:56.260]   going to come to you for counsel.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:18:59.120]   So how are you going to help her?
[00:18:59.120 --> 00:19:04.840]   You know, the world has a lot of answers for that, but as Christian women, how can we help
[00:19:04.840 --> 00:19:08.520]   our other Christian women with depressed feelings?
[00:19:08.520 --> 00:19:10.520]   Just so you know, I'll give you a stat.
[00:19:10.520 --> 00:19:12.120]   Stats are always helpful.
[00:19:12.120 --> 00:19:17.720]   Did you know that it's estimated that 25% of the U.S. population have the label depressed?
[00:19:17.720 --> 00:19:18.720]   25%.
[00:19:18.720 --> 00:19:22.200]   That's pretty staggering.
[00:19:22.200 --> 00:19:27.520]   And you know, typically their understanding of depression stems from thinking that because
[00:19:27.520 --> 00:19:35.120]   they're tired most of the time or they cry easily or stuff in their life is hard, that
[00:19:35.120 --> 00:19:37.400]   these are things that are causing my depression.
[00:19:37.400 --> 00:19:43.840]   So they're kind of coming from not really clinical depression, but just, yeah, feeling
[00:19:43.840 --> 00:19:46.920]   down because of things that are going on in their life.
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.080]   And that could be Sarah's story.
[00:19:49.080 --> 00:19:52.360]   You know, maybe we're going to find out that, you know, before kids, maybe she had this
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:58.920]   successful job before she had kids and maybe she got all this respect, you know, at work
[00:19:58.920 --> 00:20:02.160]   and people really gave her, affirmed her a lot.
[00:20:02.160 --> 00:20:06.520]   And now she's at home with these little kids who, you know how kids are, they are not going
[00:20:06.520 --> 00:20:09.240]   to say, "Mommy, you do such a good job.
[00:20:09.240 --> 00:20:10.240]   Thank you."
[00:20:10.240 --> 00:20:12.880]   You know, that could be Sarah's story.
[00:20:12.880 --> 00:20:14.880]   We don't know.
[00:20:14.880 --> 00:20:19.240]   But we need to understand how far back the problem goes because we might find something
[00:20:19.240 --> 00:20:22.240]   pretty significant in her life.
[00:20:22.240 --> 00:20:26.640]   You know, maybe she's been discouraged in her marriage for the last four years and she
[00:20:26.640 --> 00:20:31.060]   just at this point doesn't feel like dealing with it anymore.
[00:20:31.060 --> 00:20:36.560]   And so I guess just wanting to make the point that if you have someone come to you, take
[00:20:36.560 --> 00:20:40.240]   the time to just ask really good questions.
[00:20:40.240 --> 00:20:41.480]   It's important.
[00:20:41.480 --> 00:20:46.640]   If you love her and you care for her, that's going to be a big part of helping someone
[00:20:46.640 --> 00:20:51.080]   who comes to you and says, "I am depressed."
[00:20:51.080 --> 00:20:57.000]   Looking at a definition, a biblical definition by Robert Smith, he was a medical professional
[00:20:57.000 --> 00:20:59.480]   and a biblical counselor.
[00:20:59.480 --> 00:21:07.120]   And he says that depression is that debilitating, weakening mood, feeling, or air of hopelessness
[00:21:07.120 --> 00:21:13.040]   which becomes a person's reason for not handling the most important issues of life.
[00:21:13.040 --> 00:21:17.000]   And so we need to ask, why do people get depressed?
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:18.000]   Why?
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   Well, I think over the last few decades, just really in the medical community, there's been
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.320]   a huge effort on their part to educate people about depression.
[00:21:28.320 --> 00:21:30.440]   You probably read stuff yourself.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:35.400]   And really kind of depending on where you go to treat depression is going to be your
[00:21:35.400 --> 00:21:39.080]   answer as far as a secular community goes.
[00:21:39.080 --> 00:21:43.080]   So I'll just kind of take you through how they would think about this.
[00:21:43.080 --> 00:21:48.560]   If Sarah would have gone to a psychologist for her depression, and they usually hold
[00:21:48.560 --> 00:21:54.660]   to a psychoanalytical school of thought, they would probably tell Sarah that the reason
[00:21:54.660 --> 00:21:59.520]   why you're depressed is because you're probably angry about something and you're turning it
[00:21:59.520 --> 00:22:00.520]   inward.
[00:22:00.520 --> 00:22:01.520]   Okay?
[00:22:01.520 --> 00:22:04.800]   They have some interesting ways of thinking about it.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:10.400]   That you're looking at your circumstances and you're resentful and it's turning inward.
[00:22:10.400 --> 00:22:15.400]   They might say also that your depression is caused because you've lost something.
[00:22:15.400 --> 00:22:21.000]   Maybe you've lost a person in your life, like a parent or a child, or maybe it's a loss
[00:22:21.000 --> 00:22:22.800]   of self-esteem.
[00:22:22.800 --> 00:22:27.760]   The world would say that maybe she failed at something in her life and there's a sudden
[00:22:27.760 --> 00:22:29.200]   loss of self-confidence.
[00:22:29.200 --> 00:22:36.160]   So a psychologist is just kind of looking at circumstances that are causal.
[00:22:36.160 --> 00:22:41.440]   If she went to see a behaviorist, or what we would call a cognitive therapist, they
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.800]   would say that her depression stems from a learned helplessness or hopelessness.
[00:22:46.800 --> 00:22:53.300]   So for her it would be more, when I was growing up as a child I didn't get enough reinforcement,
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:59.880]   my parents didn't boost my esteem enough, and my family was dysfunctional, and that's
[00:22:59.880 --> 00:23:02.760]   how I view my world and so that's why I'm depressed.
[00:23:02.760 --> 00:23:09.760]   And so they would say that her depression is from the loss of maybe status or the loss
[00:23:09.760 --> 00:23:12.960]   of prestige or something like that.
[00:23:12.960 --> 00:23:19.440]   So if Sarah's a stay-at-home mom, maybe she's buying into this idea that she's less of a
[00:23:19.440 --> 00:23:20.820]   person.
[00:23:20.820 --> 00:23:25.040]   Even society tells wives that, wives and moms, you're less of a person if you stay home.
[00:23:25.040 --> 00:23:27.420]   And so she's believing that lie, right?
[00:23:27.420 --> 00:23:31.700]   And so people get depressed over things like that.
[00:23:31.700 --> 00:23:37.140]   If Sarah went to a doctor, a medical doctor, who held to a biological school of thought,
[00:23:37.140 --> 00:23:40.920]   they would say that her depression's probably caused by her genetics.
[00:23:40.920 --> 00:23:46.540]   Maybe her mom was depressed, maybe her dad was depressed, maybe another family member,
[00:23:46.540 --> 00:23:48.520]   there's something in her history.
[00:23:48.520 --> 00:23:51.900]   So she's predisposed to depression.
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:56.780]   Some doctors say that it's not scientific fact, they make it sound like it is, but chemical
[00:23:56.780 --> 00:23:58.980]   imbalance is not a fact, ladies.
[00:23:58.980 --> 00:24:00.620]   That's just a theory.
[00:24:00.620 --> 00:24:06.780]   They know that antidepressants will level a person out and make them feel better, but
[00:24:06.780 --> 00:24:11.100]   there's no scientific proof of what they say they think it does.
[00:24:11.100 --> 00:24:13.980]   They're just guessing at best.
[00:24:13.980 --> 00:24:17.640]   The same goes for when they tell us that the serotonin levels are low.
[00:24:17.640 --> 00:24:19.280]   That's not scientific fact.
[00:24:19.280 --> 00:24:22.880]   That's just something that they're still looking into.
[00:24:22.880 --> 00:24:24.600]   Same with neurotransmitter function.
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:29.840]   So it could be that Sarah has a physical illness.
[00:24:29.840 --> 00:24:35.800]   It's true that if you have diabetes or epilepsy or anemia, things like that, that can contribute
[00:24:35.800 --> 00:24:39.640]   to a depressed-like feeling.
[00:24:39.640 --> 00:24:44.320]   But just kind of thinking through why people are depressed, if we look at it from a biblical
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:50.960]   point of view and kind of thinking through all of these different schools of thought,
[00:24:50.960 --> 00:24:57.160]   one of the best books that I've ever looked at was written by a medical doctor and biblical
[00:24:57.160 --> 00:25:02.580]   counselor, his name is Charles Hodges, and he wrote a book called Good Mood, Bad Mood,
[00:25:02.580 --> 00:25:04.840]   and it's very good.
[00:25:04.840 --> 00:25:08.440]   It really is kind of speaking more to bipolar I and bipolar II.
[00:25:08.440 --> 00:25:12.840]   And I might have put it in the resources, but I would really encourage you to read it.
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:21.760]   But he says that there's been a lot of great work done on the topic of depression.
[00:25:21.760 --> 00:25:27.600]   And it's been at the center of healthcare since the 1980s when I was a young college
[00:25:27.600 --> 00:25:28.600]   person.
[00:25:28.600 --> 00:25:30.640]   This has been going on for years.
[00:25:30.640 --> 00:25:35.880]   And our country alone, we've spent billions and billions of dollars trying to figure out
[00:25:35.880 --> 00:25:38.680]   why people get depressed.
[00:25:38.680 --> 00:25:42.920]   And as far as the secular community is concerned, it's kind of interesting.
[00:25:42.920 --> 00:25:46.000]   They say that the results are still very discouraging.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:47.920]   They don't really know why.
[00:25:47.920 --> 00:25:50.040]   They don't know why.
[00:25:50.040 --> 00:25:54.800]   And because research has found that the medication that people are taking, and maybe this is
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:58.880]   you, maybe you found this to be true, the medication they're taking that's prescribed
[00:25:58.880 --> 00:26:02.860]   isn't working as well as it did in the past.
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:04.200]   It's just not working.
[00:26:04.200 --> 00:26:05.700]   And they don't know why.
[00:26:05.700 --> 00:26:08.640]   But it's actually causing other significant problems.
[00:26:08.640 --> 00:26:12.640]   And I would even go as far as to say that I think sometimes that bipolar 1 and 2 is
[00:26:12.640 --> 00:26:14.760]   a side effect of antidepressants.
[00:26:14.760 --> 00:26:19.880]   Because that seems to be what you see in research.
[00:26:19.880 --> 00:26:21.960]   But I mean, think about it for a minute.
[00:26:21.960 --> 00:26:22.960]   We watch these commercials.
[00:26:22.960 --> 00:26:25.640]   I mean, for heaven's sakes.
[00:26:25.640 --> 00:26:27.800]   Let's talk about Cymbalta, for example.
[00:26:27.800 --> 00:26:30.960]   You watch a commercial about Cymbalta.
[00:26:30.960 --> 00:26:35.640]   And it's all fine and good, and this person wants to go on it for her depressed feelings.
[00:26:35.640 --> 00:26:38.920]   But have you heard of the side effects that they talk about on TV?
[00:26:38.920 --> 00:26:43.160]   I mean, the side effects sound worse than the actual issue.
[00:26:43.160 --> 00:26:44.580]   I mean, I'm like, really?
[00:26:44.580 --> 00:26:45.880]   But just listen to this.
[00:26:45.880 --> 00:26:47.840]   And this is just one medication.
[00:26:47.840 --> 00:26:51.900]   Because what I'll do with a person, again, you have the freedom in Christ to be on medication.
[00:26:51.900 --> 00:26:53.440]   It's not a sin.
[00:26:53.440 --> 00:26:58.320]   But what I at least want to do is help a person to realize what the side effects are.
[00:26:58.320 --> 00:27:02.760]   I mean, make an informed decision before you decide to do this.
[00:27:02.760 --> 00:27:08.000]   We can walk through this biblically together before you take that big jump.
[00:27:08.000 --> 00:27:10.800]   Because medicine will make you feel better, but it doesn't deal with the heart.
[00:27:10.800 --> 00:27:12.560]   But anyway, Cymbalta.
[00:27:12.560 --> 00:27:19.120]   Blistering skin, peeling, loosening of the skin, blurred vision, change in consciousness,
[00:27:19.120 --> 00:27:25.040]   chills, cold sweats, confusion, difficulty swallowing, dizziness, faintness, lightheartedness
[00:27:25.040 --> 00:27:32.480]   when getting up suddenly, eye pain, fainting, irregular heartbeat, muscle pain, sores, ulcers,
[00:27:32.480 --> 00:27:38.160]   white spots in the mouth, unpleasant breath odor, upper right stomach pain, vomiting of
[00:27:38.160 --> 00:27:42.000]   blood, great, yellow eyes and skin.
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:44.700]   And my goodness, that is just a scary list.
[00:27:44.700 --> 00:27:50.200]   And that's what you get because you're dealing with medication.
[00:27:50.200 --> 00:27:54.680]   But again, I mean, if Sarah were to go to her doctor and her-- because I'm not a medical
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:27:55.680]   doctor.
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:58.740]   I don't prescribe or tell people to get off their medication.
[00:27:58.740 --> 00:28:03.820]   But if she were to go and that's what they ended up doing, she would have the freedom
[00:28:03.820 --> 00:28:04.820]   to do that.
[00:28:04.820 --> 00:28:09.960]   But I would at least want her to think through spending time with me before she makes that
[00:28:09.960 --> 00:28:10.960]   decision.
[00:28:10.960 --> 00:28:14.040]   Let's work through the spiritual issue.
[00:28:14.040 --> 00:28:18.860]   A couple of years ago, my daughter, Carly, she had a co-worker who actually committed
[00:28:18.860 --> 00:28:20.680]   suicide.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:25.080]   And it was really very perplexing because I knew who this guy was.
[00:28:25.080 --> 00:28:26.480]   He really loved his job.
[00:28:26.480 --> 00:28:29.960]   He didn't have all the signs of depression.
[00:28:29.960 --> 00:28:31.440]   He really loved his job.
[00:28:31.440 --> 00:28:33.680]   He was just a very outgoing guy.
[00:28:33.680 --> 00:28:35.920]   He was very physically healthy.
[00:28:35.920 --> 00:28:39.020]   He loved his dog very much.
[00:28:39.020 --> 00:28:42.520]   And so I began to ask questions about what was going on there.
[00:28:42.520 --> 00:28:48.740]   And it was kind of discovered in the conversation that he had just gone on antidepressants.
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:53.040]   And that concerned me because he was, I guess, apparently struggling with some kind of depressed
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:55.800]   mood and that's what the doctor chose to do.
[00:28:55.800 --> 00:29:02.160]   And when I looked up the medication that they put him on, this is what I read about it.
[00:29:02.160 --> 00:29:09.680]   It may have a role in inducing worsening of depression and the emergence of suicide in
[00:29:09.680 --> 00:29:13.240]   certain patients during the early phases of treatment.
[00:29:13.240 --> 00:29:14.560]   And that's really what happened to him.
[00:29:14.560 --> 00:29:21.000]   I'm convinced that he became very suicidal as a side effect.
[00:29:21.000 --> 00:29:24.040]   And so he'd only been on it for two weeks.
[00:29:24.040 --> 00:29:29.640]   I don't think that his, from what I understand, he was feeling depressed or maybe had just
[00:29:29.640 --> 00:29:33.320]   depressed feelings but he wasn't suicidal when he went on the medication.
[00:29:33.320 --> 00:29:34.320]   So it didn't get better.
[00:29:34.320 --> 00:29:36.240]   It actually had gotten worse.
[00:29:36.240 --> 00:29:39.880]   And that really, really concerned me.
[00:29:39.880 --> 00:29:44.960]   The sad fact is that those who have been diagnosed with depression, you need to know that really
[00:29:44.960 --> 00:29:48.880]   only 10% really are, 10% of the people out there.
[00:29:48.880 --> 00:29:52.880]   This is a huge industry for pharmacy.
[00:29:52.880 --> 00:29:57.440]   They're making lots and lots of money on meds out there and that's part of the issue.
[00:29:57.440 --> 00:30:07.040]   They over-diagnose and they're so quick to give people drugs to deal with depressed feelings.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:12.840]   I think one of the issues is just not making a distinction between true depression versus
[00:30:12.840 --> 00:30:15.040]   sadness or discouragement.
[00:30:15.040 --> 00:30:18.120]   I think we're just not really thinking through that carefully.
[00:30:18.120 --> 00:30:23.840]   I mean, for example, if you know a person that's truly clinically depressed, there are
[00:30:23.840 --> 00:30:28.320]   just some real common characteristics you see.
[00:30:28.320 --> 00:30:30.960]   Like they just stop functioning altogether.
[00:30:30.960 --> 00:30:32.100]   They're not working.
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:34.500]   They're not out there working or going to school or doing whatever.
[00:30:34.500 --> 00:30:36.360]   They just stop functioning.
[00:30:36.360 --> 00:30:38.400]   And I've observed that in friends.
[00:30:38.400 --> 00:30:39.920]   I'm thinking of one friend.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:46.060]   He had a very difficult circumstance happen and he responded by spiraling into depression
[00:30:46.060 --> 00:30:47.800]   and he didn't leave his house.
[00:30:47.800 --> 00:30:50.440]   He quit his job.
[00:30:50.440 --> 00:30:51.980]   He just ceased to function normally.
[00:30:51.980 --> 00:30:58.400]   He lost a tremendous amount of weight, about 40 pounds, and he was very restless and all
[00:30:58.400 --> 00:30:59.480]   of this kind of thing.
[00:30:59.480 --> 00:31:01.840]   And so he was debilitated.
[00:31:01.840 --> 00:31:04.520]   That's kind of more clinical depression, right?
[00:31:04.520 --> 00:31:05.720]   They're just not functioning.
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:10.500]   They're like what you would say down and out.
[00:31:10.500 --> 00:31:15.240]   And some of that was triggered by physical issues and medication and spiritual issues.
[00:31:15.240 --> 00:31:22.160]   But most people are just in a state of just discouragement or sadness over something going
[00:31:22.160 --> 00:31:24.660]   on in their life.
[00:31:24.660 --> 00:31:30.000]   And so, you know, they may feel down, but they're functioning.
[00:31:30.000 --> 00:31:31.320]   They're going to work every day.
[00:31:31.320 --> 00:31:32.840]   They're getting out of bed.
[00:31:32.840 --> 00:31:33.920]   They're going to school.
[00:31:33.920 --> 00:31:38.920]   They're doing what they need to do, but they just have depressed feelings.
[00:31:38.920 --> 00:31:44.360]   And so my opinion about people like Sarah that come to counsel that have a label of
[00:31:44.360 --> 00:31:50.440]   depression, not all, but most I would say in my experience are just really in a state
[00:31:50.440 --> 00:31:53.080]   of discouragement.
[00:31:53.080 --> 00:31:56.880]   So if you look back at your case study, you know, you're going to notice that Sarah said
[00:31:56.880 --> 00:31:58.560]   she felt terribly sad.
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:01.160]   She's not keeping up with life.
[00:32:01.160 --> 00:32:02.520]   Her friends are trying to help.
[00:32:02.520 --> 00:32:06.800]   They think medicine is going to be the option because even they believe she's clinically
[00:32:06.800 --> 00:32:07.800]   depressed.
[00:32:07.800 --> 00:32:10.560]   I mean, that's like their assumption right away.
[00:32:10.560 --> 00:32:14.840]   Oh, here, you know, let's get you to the doctor and get you on some antidepressants.
[00:32:14.840 --> 00:32:18.360]   But that's not usually the issue.
[00:32:18.360 --> 00:32:22.320]   I mean, she could have a medical issue, it's true, but she's not going to know that until
[00:32:22.320 --> 00:32:25.600]   she goes to the doctor to find out.
[00:32:25.600 --> 00:32:27.000]   She's probably just an overwhelmed mommy.
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.120]   Do you feel like an overwhelmed mommy sometimes?
[00:32:31.120 --> 00:32:35.360]   Sometimes you're just overwhelmed with things that we're going through.
[00:32:35.360 --> 00:32:37.840]   And you know, when our kids are little, it's hard.
[00:32:37.840 --> 00:32:41.480]   I mean, sometimes even when you have a baby, you get what they call the baby blues.
[00:32:41.480 --> 00:32:43.960]   It's just normal.
[00:32:43.960 --> 00:32:49.960]   And so we need to find out some things about our friend Sarah to make sure that it's just
[00:32:49.960 --> 00:32:50.960]   that.
[00:32:50.960 --> 00:32:55.160]   And also, I have to say that the world is telling you a lie right now.
[00:32:55.160 --> 00:32:59.440]   Whenever you watch those commercials, these marketers, they're really savvy because what
[00:32:59.440 --> 00:33:04.800]   they're trying to tell you is that you need to look for ways to escape feeling sad.
[00:33:04.800 --> 00:33:06.000]   Okay?
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:09.400]   They're telling you that sadness is bad.
[00:33:09.400 --> 00:33:13.400]   And believe it or not, that's kind of their marketing plan.
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:19.760]   And they work really hard at it to convince you that you need to have a way of escape.
[00:33:19.760 --> 00:33:23.640]   And it seems to reflect the attitude that there's just no good that can come out of
[00:33:23.640 --> 00:33:24.640]   sadness.
[00:33:24.640 --> 00:33:25.640]   What do you think?
[00:33:25.640 --> 00:33:28.280]   Do you think there's some good that can come out of sadness?
[00:33:28.280 --> 00:33:31.200]   Do you think it drives you to the Lord sometimes?
[00:33:31.200 --> 00:33:35.600]   There's a lot of good that can come out of sadness if you have the right perspective.
[00:33:35.600 --> 00:33:40.520]   And so I think with women like Sarah, if you were just to come alongside her and just have
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:45.000]   compassion and care, and if you were to ask her some good questions, you could just help
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:49.420]   to reorient her back to Christ-like counsel.
[00:33:49.420 --> 00:33:51.000]   And we don't have to be afraid of this.
[00:33:51.000 --> 00:33:54.840]   Have I beat this head enough?
[00:33:54.840 --> 00:34:00.240]   God's Word tells you in Romans 15, 14, that if you are full of goodness, which you are
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:04.520]   if you're in Christ, and you're filled with knowledge, which you are because you have
[00:34:04.520 --> 00:34:09.320]   God's Word, then you're able to counsel one another by coming alongside and gently guiding
[00:34:09.320 --> 00:34:16.120]   the Sarahs toward a response that's keeping in her profession in Christ.
[00:34:16.120 --> 00:34:23.200]   So we may need to introduce her to the Savior, or if she's already in Christ, we just need
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:25.400]   to help her to get back on track.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:28.760]   So I'm going to give you a biblical perspective to kind of end our time so you know where
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:31.320]   to take her in the Bible, okay?
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:34.040]   We'll just kind of end there.
[00:34:34.040 --> 00:34:39.560]   Here's a very broad perspective for your consideration under the point of biblical
[00:34:39.560 --> 00:34:42.680]   perspective on the development of depression.
[00:34:42.680 --> 00:34:49.760]   First of all, depression, as we've defined it, is only possible in a fallen world.
[00:34:49.760 --> 00:34:53.720]   That's post-fall depression, which is interesting.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:58.400]   Romans 5, 12 reminds us that just as sin entered the world through one man and death through
[00:34:58.400 --> 00:35:03.020]   sin, and in this way death came to all people because all have sin.
[00:35:03.020 --> 00:35:08.480]   So broadly speaking, you need to know that depression is the only logical, rational,
[00:35:08.480 --> 00:35:13.600]   consistent conclusion of someone that's living without God.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:18.960]   That's why people in the world get depressed that aren't believers, because they're separated
[00:35:18.960 --> 00:35:23.160]   from Christ and they don't have that hope that you have.
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:29.400]   I think one regret that my daughter Carly had with her co-worker is she felt guilt over
[00:35:29.400 --> 00:35:32.960]   this and she's not in control of this guy being saved, but she would have wanted to
[00:35:32.960 --> 00:35:38.240]   have time to witness more to him, so that's kind of normal to struggle with that.
[00:35:38.240 --> 00:35:41.440]   But she recognized that he needed hope in Christ.
[00:35:41.440 --> 00:35:44.920]   That was the big thing at the forefront of her mind.
[00:35:44.920 --> 00:35:51.000]   Which leads us to the next point, that deliverance from depression or despair or sadness, which
[00:35:51.000 --> 00:35:54.840]   is one of the effects of the fall, is actually made possible through the redeeming work of
[00:35:54.840 --> 00:36:00.400]   Christ, and that includes our justification, our sanctification, and just that work that
[00:36:00.400 --> 00:36:03.920]   the Holy Spirit does in all of us.
[00:36:03.920 --> 00:36:05.400]   But you know what?
[00:36:05.400 --> 00:36:09.200]   Depression and despair isn't just isolated to unbelievers, right?
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:13.800]   How many of you know a believer that's feeling despairing right now?
[00:36:13.800 --> 00:36:14.800]   Depressed or discouraged?
[00:36:14.800 --> 00:36:16.680]   Yeah, a few of you.
[00:36:16.680 --> 00:36:18.320]   We know people in our life.
[00:36:18.320 --> 00:36:20.640]   We may be those people.
[00:36:20.640 --> 00:36:25.760]   And the reason why people struggle with it now is because, my goodness, we still struggle
[00:36:25.760 --> 00:36:27.800]   with indwelling sin.
[00:36:27.800 --> 00:36:29.720]   We still have that.
[00:36:29.720 --> 00:36:34.600]   We're not perfected this side of heaven, and we haven't perfectly put off the old man.
[00:36:34.600 --> 00:36:39.800]   We were talking about put off, put on before, but we haven't done that perfectly.
[00:36:39.800 --> 00:36:45.760]   And we're still working through putting off the old man and putting on the new and being
[00:36:45.760 --> 00:36:47.860]   renewed in the mind.
[00:36:47.860 --> 00:36:52.640]   We still have the temptation of just difficult circumstances and people in our life and just
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:53.720]   dealing with that.
[00:36:53.720 --> 00:36:56.120]   It's hard when you've got difficult people in your life.
[00:36:56.120 --> 00:36:57.600]   You know, maybe your work is difficult.
[00:36:57.600 --> 00:36:58.920]   Maybe your marriage is difficult.
[00:36:58.920 --> 00:37:02.320]   Maybe these other things outside of you are just difficult.
[00:37:02.320 --> 00:37:07.320]   And we're really only seeing through a glass darkly and only know in part because we're
[00:37:07.320 --> 00:37:12.760]   at this side of heaven, you know, and so we only have a down payment of our inheritance.
[00:37:12.760 --> 00:37:14.920]   Our down payment is the Holy Spirit.
[00:37:14.920 --> 00:37:19.160]   That's your earnest knowing that we have a future inheritance, but right now we just
[00:37:19.160 --> 00:37:20.160]   have that down payment.
[00:37:20.160 --> 00:37:22.320]   And so we struggle with those three enemies.
[00:37:22.320 --> 00:37:23.520]   You struggle with your flesh.
[00:37:23.520 --> 00:37:25.240]   You struggle with the world.
[00:37:25.240 --> 00:37:27.760]   You struggle with Satan.
[00:37:27.760 --> 00:37:32.960]   But our hope, however, is knowing that we will eventually experience complete and continuous
[00:37:32.960 --> 00:37:37.880]   uninterrupted deliverance from depression and all other effects of the fall when we're
[00:37:37.880 --> 00:37:40.320]   glorified someday.
[00:37:40.320 --> 00:37:41.880]   So that's encouraging to know.
[00:37:41.880 --> 00:37:44.480]   It's not, again, depression, you don't have to be stuck there.
[00:37:44.480 --> 00:37:48.840]   There's actually hope that you can work through depression.
[00:37:48.840 --> 00:37:55.440]   And I've got three really great biblical examples for you of people that responded well and
[00:37:55.440 --> 00:37:57.640]   people that didn't respond well.
[00:37:57.640 --> 00:37:59.880]   And you can kind of take that for your consideration.
[00:37:59.880 --> 00:38:02.320]   So there are just so many.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:06.260]   You know, the word depression isn't really used in the Bible, that actual word.
[00:38:06.260 --> 00:38:14.200]   It's usually a synonym like despair or downtrodden or fallen countenance, things like that.
[00:38:14.200 --> 00:38:15.200]   But it means the same.
[00:38:15.200 --> 00:38:20.040]   And the first person that I'd like to have you consider is Cain.
[00:38:20.040 --> 00:38:22.360]   You guys remember Cain from Genesis 4?
[00:38:22.360 --> 00:38:23.360]   Yeah?
[00:38:23.360 --> 00:38:28.480]   So we know who Cain is, first son, one of the sons of Adam and Eve.
[00:38:28.480 --> 00:38:33.360]   And remember, you'll recall he brought an offering to the Lord and that was rejected
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:34.620]   by God.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:40.640]   But instead of repenting of this envious attitude that he had towards his brother Abel, he became
[00:38:40.640 --> 00:38:41.640]   angry.
[00:38:41.640 --> 00:38:47.800]   And he responded by being angry and then eventually that kind of spiraled down into a fallen countenance,
[00:38:47.800 --> 00:38:50.320]   which is that synonym for depression.
[00:38:50.320 --> 00:38:55.880]   And so Cain kind of becomes an example for us of somebody that has unconfessed sin.
[00:38:55.880 --> 00:39:00.000]   Sometimes people are just depressed because they have unconfessed sin in their lives.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:02.520]   I mean, that's just a fact.
[00:39:02.520 --> 00:39:05.280]   And the Lord even tried to help Cain to do what was right.
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:09.400]   Remember, he told him that sin is crouching at the door and you need to repent.
[00:39:09.400 --> 00:39:12.600]   I mean, you have this opportunity, do it.
[00:39:12.600 --> 00:39:14.160]   But he didn't.
[00:39:14.160 --> 00:39:20.380]   He actually complicated his sin by adding revenge and adding all these other things.
[00:39:20.380 --> 00:39:25.960]   And so Cain becomes an example for all of us of somebody who was aware of personal sin
[00:39:25.960 --> 00:39:28.160]   in his life, but he failed miserably.
[00:39:28.160 --> 00:39:30.080]   He didn't handle it biblically.
[00:39:30.080 --> 00:39:33.540]   He made it worse by not dealing with it biblically.
[00:39:33.540 --> 00:39:38.040]   And he became a wanderer, a restless wanderer, the rest of his life because he wouldn't humble
[00:39:38.040 --> 00:39:39.520]   himself.
[00:39:39.520 --> 00:39:44.400]   David, of course, is the other example of someone we can look to.
[00:39:44.400 --> 00:39:51.880]   I actually love Psalm 32 because David talks about what life was like when he had unconfessed
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   sin in his life.
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:53.880]   Do you remember what his sin was?
[00:39:53.880 --> 00:39:57.040]   I mean, he is a man after God's own heart, but he is human.
[00:39:57.040 --> 00:39:59.880]   He failed a lot.
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:03.920]   And he committed adultery, you'll recall.
[00:40:03.920 --> 00:40:09.760]   And not only that, but he made a way for that woman's husband to be killed in battle, and
[00:40:09.760 --> 00:40:13.440]   so he would be responsible for that man's murder.
[00:40:13.440 --> 00:40:20.360]   And so he was in sin, and because of that unconfessed sin, he says in Psalm 32 that
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:26.000]   when he kept silent about his sin, he felt as if his bones were wasting away.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:32.760]   So there was a physical crushing component to his sin, and God's hand was really heavy
[00:40:32.760 --> 00:40:34.240]   on David.
[00:40:34.240 --> 00:40:40.320]   So if you ever want to get an idea of what can happen to you physically, Psalm 32 is
[00:40:40.320 --> 00:40:41.320]   a great place to look.
[00:40:41.320 --> 00:40:44.720]   I mean, he even talks about his strength being dried up.
[00:40:44.720 --> 00:40:49.720]   But really, thanks be to God, David didn't respond the way Cain responded.
[00:40:49.720 --> 00:40:56.160]   David actually repented, and he says in Psalm 32, verse 5, "I acknowledged my sin to you,"
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.560]   and he's talking to God, "and I didn't cover my iniquity.
[00:40:59.560 --> 00:41:03.480]   I said, 'I'll confess my transgressions to the Lord, and you forgave the iniquity of
[00:41:03.480 --> 00:41:04.480]   my sin.
[00:41:04.480 --> 00:41:08.320]   So blessed is the man against whom the Lord counts no iniquity.'"
[00:41:08.320 --> 00:41:15.120]   So like Cain, David is a person who's an example of a person who became depressed because of
[00:41:15.120 --> 00:41:17.480]   unconfessed sin, for sure.
[00:41:17.480 --> 00:41:23.920]   But unlike Cain, David confessed his sin, and so he was delivered from his despairing
[00:41:23.920 --> 00:41:24.920]   feelings.
[00:41:24.920 --> 00:41:29.680]   That could be what's going on with Sarah or your friend, a friend that you know, or even
[00:41:29.680 --> 00:41:30.680]   yourself.
[00:41:30.680 --> 00:41:33.620]   It could just be unconfessed sin.
[00:41:33.620 --> 00:41:37.200]   And so, you know, remember we talked about bitterness.
[00:41:37.200 --> 00:41:42.280]   That will lead a person to depression easily if they continue to walk down the road of
[00:41:42.280 --> 00:41:44.720]   bitterness.
[00:41:44.720 --> 00:41:48.200]   Other reasons why people experience sadness or despair is because they're dealing with
[00:41:48.200 --> 00:41:51.320]   difficult circumstances in their life.
[00:41:51.320 --> 00:41:54.360]   And Hannah is actually just a wonderful example.
[00:41:54.360 --> 00:41:59.320]   And so we'll learn from Hannah, and then I'll let you guys be done.
[00:41:59.320 --> 00:42:01.440]   But turn to 1 Samuel 1.
[00:42:01.440 --> 00:42:05.420]   Hannah is just a great person to learn from.
[00:42:05.420 --> 00:42:07.520]   She becomes so real for us.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:11.720]   While you're turning there, I'll just give you some quick background.
[00:42:11.720 --> 00:42:17.160]   Hannah lived during the time of the judges, and that was really one of the darkest times
[00:42:17.160 --> 00:42:20.680]   in Israel's history.
[00:42:20.680 --> 00:42:25.480]   They, you know, this is the time when everybody did what was right in their own eyes, right?
[00:42:25.480 --> 00:42:28.640]   And it was a very backslidden era.
[00:42:28.640 --> 00:42:35.080]   But despite that, Hannah and her husband would still travel faithfully to the temple in Shiloh
[00:42:35.080 --> 00:42:38.640]   to give a, to do an offering for the Lord.
[00:42:38.640 --> 00:42:43.120]   They were just considered a very devout family.
[00:42:43.120 --> 00:42:48.960]   But in addition to the difficult circumstances, her environment, if you will, within her community,
[00:42:48.960 --> 00:42:51.400]   her home life was very troubling.
[00:42:51.400 --> 00:42:53.420]   And so we learn something about Elkanah.
[00:42:53.420 --> 00:42:57.560]   So look at verse 2 of 1 Samuel 1.
[00:42:57.560 --> 00:43:00.720]   It says that Elkanah had two wives.
[00:43:00.720 --> 00:43:05.460]   The name of the one was Hannah, and the name of the other was Peninnah.
[00:43:05.460 --> 00:43:09.520]   And Peninnah had children, but Hannah had no children.
[00:43:09.520 --> 00:43:14.360]   So the first thing we learn about Hannah's circumstance is that her husband was a polygamist.
[00:43:14.360 --> 00:43:15.360]   What do you think about that?
[00:43:15.360 --> 00:43:16.800]   That would be tough.
[00:43:16.800 --> 00:43:19.360]   Your husband had two wives, okay.
[00:43:19.360 --> 00:43:24.440]   And the second thing it says is that Peninnah apparently had children, but Hannah was barren.
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:26.160]   She didn't have any children just yet.
[00:43:26.160 --> 00:43:30.600]   So that's a very, very difficult circumstance.
[00:43:30.600 --> 00:43:35.160]   Probably what's happening here is the husband Elkanah, he probably is an example in the
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:41.000]   Old Testament of a man who, when he realized his first wife was barren, he took on a second
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:46.680]   wife because they're always concerned about, you know, carrying on the next generation.
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:49.360]   And so he did it out of a lack of faith.
[00:43:49.360 --> 00:43:54.640]   But as we read on, let's discover what the relationship was like between these two wives,
[00:43:54.640 --> 00:43:55.640]   right?
[00:43:55.640 --> 00:44:01.100]   So let's look at verse 6 in 1 Samuel 1.
[00:44:01.100 --> 00:44:06.360]   So it says, "Her rival," well that's interesting, so now Peninnah's being thought of as a rival.
[00:44:06.360 --> 00:44:12.600]   "Her rival, however, would provoke Hannah bitterly to irritate her because the Lord
[00:44:12.600 --> 00:44:14.940]   had closed her womb."
[00:44:14.940 --> 00:44:16.440]   So that's interesting.
[00:44:16.440 --> 00:44:20.640]   We find out that Peninnah was not a very nice lady.
[00:44:20.640 --> 00:44:26.680]   And so that kind of gives you insight into Hannah's just personal circumstance and her
[00:44:26.680 --> 00:44:27.680]   suffering.
[00:44:27.680 --> 00:44:32.600]   She lives in a society, first of all, where a woman's identity is found in bearing children
[00:44:32.600 --> 00:44:33.700]   to her husband.
[00:44:33.700 --> 00:44:36.880]   So that's a big deal in the Jewish culture.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:42.400]   And now that she's sort of barren, her sterility has made her vulnerable to someone else's
[00:44:42.400 --> 00:44:44.280]   ridicule.
[00:44:44.280 --> 00:44:46.960]   And that would be a very, very hard life.
[00:44:46.960 --> 00:44:52.600]   And so Hannah had to live with this woman day in and day out, listening to her, reminding
[00:44:52.600 --> 00:44:56.360]   her of her failure to live out her purpose in her life.
[00:44:56.360 --> 00:45:00.840]   But scripture kind of gives us a glimpse in how she was initially responding.
[00:45:00.840 --> 00:45:04.640]   So look at verse 10, jump to 10.
[00:45:04.640 --> 00:45:11.680]   "Hannah was greatly distressed, but she prayed to the Lord and she wept bitterly.
[00:45:11.680 --> 00:45:16.040]   And then she made a vow and said, 'O Lord of hosts, if you will indeed look on the affliction
[00:45:16.040 --> 00:45:20.560]   of your maidservant and remember me and not forget your maidservant, but will give your
[00:45:20.560 --> 00:45:24.640]   maidservant a son, then I will give him to the Lord all the days of his life and a razor
[00:45:24.640 --> 00:45:27.520]   shall never come to his head.'"
[00:45:27.520 --> 00:45:30.840]   And so, you know, obviously she's in distress.
[00:45:30.840 --> 00:45:36.880]   That's the same, that word for despair has the idea of being in a state of unhappiness.
[00:45:36.880 --> 00:45:38.260]   So we know that she's unhappy.
[00:45:38.260 --> 00:45:41.100]   We know that she's in distress.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:43.680]   And she's just dealing with a lot of difficult things.
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:46.560]   And so she was sad over her circumstance.
[00:45:46.560 --> 00:45:50.600]   Makes sense to me that she would be sad.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:52.440]   And that drove her though to the Lord.
[00:45:52.440 --> 00:45:53.440]   I want you to see that.
[00:45:53.440 --> 00:46:01.240]   It's really a clear picture that God used Hannah's sadness to drive her to him.
[00:46:01.240 --> 00:46:05.720]   And sometimes when we're really deep in discouragement and we're sad, we're not really making that
[00:46:05.720 --> 00:46:06.720]   connection.
[00:46:06.720 --> 00:46:10.880]   God can use that to drive you to him in particular.
[00:46:10.880 --> 00:46:14.400]   And the first thing that we learn is that she went to the temple and she prayed and
[00:46:14.400 --> 00:46:16.120]   she worshipped God.
[00:46:16.120 --> 00:46:17.240]   Okay?
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:21.160]   And so she went to the Lord, she worshipped God.
[00:46:21.160 --> 00:46:23.600]   She didn't angry, it doesn't say she became angry.
[00:46:23.600 --> 00:46:24.600]   It didn't say she pouted.
[00:46:24.600 --> 00:46:27.120]   It doesn't say that she slept all day.
[00:46:27.120 --> 00:46:33.200]   Rather, she becomes an example to us of somebody who endured her difficult circumstances and
[00:46:33.200 --> 00:46:35.220]   ill treatment at the hands of Penina.
[00:46:35.220 --> 00:46:42.420]   And she ran to the Lord to find solace there, to find refuge there, to find comfort in him.
[00:46:42.420 --> 00:46:44.900]   And David is another example of that.
[00:46:44.900 --> 00:46:50.860]   Sometime you need to read through Psalm 119, but there is a verse that talks about God,
[00:46:50.860 --> 00:46:55.000]   that David begging God to revive him according to God's word.
[00:46:55.000 --> 00:47:02.100]   Now in verse 11 of 1 Samuel, we also notice that she makes a vow and she cries out to
[00:47:02.100 --> 00:47:03.980]   the Lord of hosts.
[00:47:03.980 --> 00:47:10.220]   And that's important for you to pay attention to because although Hannah's in distress
[00:47:10.220 --> 00:47:13.420]   and there's a lot of difficult things that are happening to her, I want you to recognize
[00:47:13.420 --> 00:47:18.220]   that she has a very high view of God and that is going to serve her well.
[00:47:18.220 --> 00:47:21.900]   She really sees the Lord as the Lord God Almighty.
[00:47:21.900 --> 00:47:25.500]   She sees him as her deliverer and her distress.
[00:47:25.500 --> 00:47:28.020]   We know that her circumstance is difficult.
[00:47:28.020 --> 00:47:32.500]   I mean, with any woman I work with, I'm not going to dismiss or be cavalier about her
[00:47:32.500 --> 00:47:33.500]   circumstances.
[00:47:33.500 --> 00:47:35.740]   I'm going to be compassionate about that.
[00:47:35.740 --> 00:47:38.980]   But I'm also going to try to help her to see that she needs to have a higher view of
[00:47:38.980 --> 00:47:42.300]   God in the midst of that.
[00:47:42.300 --> 00:47:47.980]   And so she sees herself rightly, she sees God rightly, and so she's begging God as
[00:47:47.980 --> 00:47:52.900]   a servant, which is just another indication of her viewing God rightly, that if he would
[00:47:52.900 --> 00:47:59.420]   only look on her affliction and would remember her and give her a son that would be fit to
[00:47:59.420 --> 00:48:03.300]   serve in the tabernacle, she would turn him back to the Lord.
[00:48:03.300 --> 00:48:05.340]   And we know the rest of the story with Hannah.
[00:48:05.340 --> 00:48:09.380]   You know, she did have a son later and she did give him back to the Lord.
[00:48:09.380 --> 00:48:13.500]   But I think as a woman, we can probably really relate to Hannah.
[00:48:13.500 --> 00:48:17.700]   And as a matter of fact, we all have women in our lives that are having a difficult time
[00:48:17.700 --> 00:48:18.700]   having children.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:25.060]   So she actually becomes a really, really close to home example of what a person goes through
[00:48:25.060 --> 00:48:31.660]   when they're having difficulty getting pregnant or when they have lost a child to miscarriage
[00:48:31.660 --> 00:48:34.380]   or something like that.
[00:48:34.380 --> 00:48:40.260]   You know, when I was studying this particular lesson, my daughter's friend had just lost
[00:48:40.260 --> 00:48:44.940]   a baby and I was just thinking about how sad that is and how despairing women get when
[00:48:44.940 --> 00:48:47.060]   they lose children.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:53.180]   And it's pretty easy to spiral into a deeper depression if you allow it to.
[00:48:53.180 --> 00:48:58.820]   But you know, women that we come alongside with, and even for ourselves, we can really
[00:48:58.820 --> 00:49:05.420]   look to Hannah's example to kind of help us pull out of depression.
[00:49:05.420 --> 00:49:08.940]   You can allow it to instruct your heart.
[00:49:08.940 --> 00:49:14.620]   And again, in her case, she allowed her sadness, just drove her to the Lord and she pleaded
[00:49:14.620 --> 00:49:15.900]   her case.
[00:49:15.900 --> 00:49:21.460]   And so she's really an example of someone who prayed regularly, who prayed dependably
[00:49:21.460 --> 00:49:25.660]   and deliberately despite her provocation.
[00:49:25.660 --> 00:49:30.040]   And in the same way, when we're dealing with difficult circumstances like childlessness
[00:49:30.040 --> 00:49:34.180]   or difficult people in our life, God has got to be the one that we run to first.
[00:49:34.180 --> 00:49:36.100]   You know, a lot of times we just run to people first.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:40.340]   But God should be who you run to first.
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:44.460]   And just pour your hearts out to him because, ladies, he really is your comfort.
[00:49:44.460 --> 00:49:46.700]   He is your refuge in times of trouble.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.460]   We need to see the Lord in that way.
[00:49:49.460 --> 00:49:53.940]   So we need to step out in faith because God is there to help you.
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:58.580]   And he's actually using your circumstance to conform you into the image of his son,
[00:49:58.580 --> 00:50:02.940]   which is so important and why we can even count it all joy.
[00:50:02.940 --> 00:50:08.740]   Hannah's also an example to us because in her trial, she cast her burdens upon the Lord.
[00:50:08.740 --> 00:50:09.740]   That's important.
[00:50:09.740 --> 00:50:13.280]   And that's an example of what we would say right actions.
[00:50:13.280 --> 00:50:20.040]   If you look at verse 17 to 18 of 1 Samuel, Eli is part of this.
[00:50:20.040 --> 00:50:22.040]   He was the priest of the temple at the time.
[00:50:22.040 --> 00:50:28.960]   And after she had been praying to the Lord, Eli answered her and said, "Go in peace and
[00:50:28.960 --> 00:50:33.380]   may the God of Israel grant your petition that you have asked of him."
[00:50:33.380 --> 00:50:35.980]   And she said, "Let your maidservant find favor in your sight."
[00:50:35.980 --> 00:50:42.080]   So the woman went her way and she ate and her face was no longer sad.
[00:50:42.080 --> 00:50:47.180]   And so, of course, if you know the story, we know that before Eli had made some really
[00:50:47.180 --> 00:50:51.480]   insensitive remarks to Hannah because when she was praying really deeply, he kind of
[00:50:51.480 --> 00:50:55.240]   accused her of being drunk, which was really interesting.
[00:50:55.240 --> 00:51:01.720]   But after Hannah responded in humility and explained the situation, we kind of learned
[00:51:01.720 --> 00:51:06.560]   that Hannah went away and she ate and her face was no longer sad.
[00:51:06.560 --> 00:51:11.720]   I think that's such a beautiful picture of someone who just didn't dwell on her plight
[00:51:11.720 --> 00:51:12.720]   too long.
[00:51:12.720 --> 00:51:18.800]   I mean, her situation is difficult, but instead of dwelling on it and just spiraling down
[00:51:18.800 --> 00:51:23.840]   into this depression that a lot of people succumb to, she actually took the time to
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:25.020]   pray.
[00:51:25.020 --> 00:51:29.240]   She cast her burdens upon the Lord, believing that he cares for her.
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:32.600]   And in a sense, she kind of left him in the altar, left him at the altar.
[00:51:32.600 --> 00:51:38.880]   And then she, you know, went away knowing that a sovereign God was going to take care
[00:51:38.880 --> 00:51:39.880]   of her.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:43.440]   And that just kind of demonstrates a very faithful and patient trust in God.
[00:51:43.440 --> 00:51:48.000]   And I'm taking a woman through this whole narrative and I'm explaining these things
[00:51:48.000 --> 00:51:49.800]   to her, just like I'm explaining to you.
[00:51:49.800 --> 00:51:54.440]   I'm trying to help her to see that your sadness doesn't have to drive you into the ground.
[00:51:54.440 --> 00:51:55.680]   You know, there's hope.
[00:51:55.680 --> 00:51:57.280]   We have a woman in the Bible.
[00:51:57.280 --> 00:52:01.480]   I can show you a much better way.
[00:52:01.480 --> 00:52:05.760]   And in the same way that Hannah cast her burdens upon the Lord, we too are instructed to do
[00:52:05.760 --> 00:52:06.760]   the same thing.
[00:52:06.760 --> 00:52:14.280]   I've quoted 1 Peter 5, 6-7 to you before, but we can cast our anxieties upon the Lord
[00:52:14.280 --> 00:52:16.800]   because he cares for us.
[00:52:16.800 --> 00:52:22.240]   And so we, you know, God bestows favor upon those whom he loves and we need to believe
[00:52:22.240 --> 00:52:23.360]   that.
[00:52:23.360 --> 00:52:28.260]   And so that's one way we can humble ourselves when we're discouraged and we're disappointed.
[00:52:28.260 --> 00:52:32.280]   We can go to the Lord and we can cast those anxieties upon him.
[00:52:32.280 --> 00:52:35.360]   David says the same thing in Psalm 55, 22.
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:37.080]   He says, "Cast your burden on the Lord.
[00:52:37.080 --> 00:52:39.280]   He's going to sustain you."
[00:52:39.280 --> 00:52:40.280]   It's amazing.
[00:52:40.280 --> 00:52:44.520]   We know he's not going to allow the righteous to be shaken, but you've got to believe these
[00:52:44.520 --> 00:52:46.760]   things in your life.
[00:52:46.760 --> 00:52:49.760]   You've got to believe that God's going to do that.
[00:52:49.760 --> 00:52:56.560]   So if you spend your days fretting and worrying about your life, it's going to result in despair.
[00:52:56.560 --> 00:53:02.240]   But if we trust in the Lord and we believe that he's sovereign and we can cast those
[00:53:02.240 --> 00:53:06.840]   anxieties upon him, you know, we're promised that he will care for us.
[00:53:06.840 --> 00:53:08.280]   But you've got to believe that.
[00:53:08.280 --> 00:53:13.360]   You've got to believe that he's really going to do that for you.
[00:53:13.360 --> 00:53:19.040]   One of the, Jeremiah, I think another maybe passage you could take someone to that would
[00:53:19.040 --> 00:53:23.960]   be really important would be like Jeremiah 3.
[00:53:23.960 --> 00:53:30.800]   You know, Jeremiah, I mean, the guy, you know, he was such a faithful man of God, wonderful
[00:53:30.800 --> 00:53:35.680]   prophet of the Lord, and the people that he was dealing with never repented.
[00:53:35.680 --> 00:53:39.640]   You know, I mean, he just, just amazing to think about his life.
[00:53:39.640 --> 00:53:41.440]   And so he was often despairing.
[00:53:41.440 --> 00:53:44.000]   He often would lose hope.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:48.880]   But I mean, you know this, I think maybe Jen read this the first night, but I mean, just
[00:53:48.880 --> 00:53:52.200]   listen to how he deals with his own great sadness.
[00:53:52.200 --> 00:53:55.760]   He says, "The steadfast love of the Lord never ceases.
[00:53:55.760 --> 00:53:58.320]   His mercies never come to an end.
[00:53:58.320 --> 00:53:59.840]   They are new every morning.
[00:53:59.840 --> 00:54:03.920]   Great is your faithfulness, for the Lord will not cast off forever.
[00:54:03.920 --> 00:54:08.520]   But though he cause grief, he will have compassion according to the abundance of his steadfast
[00:54:08.520 --> 00:54:13.800]   love, for he does not willingly afflict or grieve the children of men."
[00:54:13.800 --> 00:54:18.760]   And so, you know, we just need to encourage women like Sarah that we read about who are
[00:54:18.760 --> 00:54:23.600]   struggling with sadness and even true depression that God already knows what they're going
[00:54:23.600 --> 00:54:24.840]   through.
[00:54:24.840 --> 00:54:29.400]   So we need to go to him in prayer and cast our anxieties upon him.
[00:54:29.400 --> 00:54:32.080]   I think Hannah understood that in 1 Samuel.
[00:54:32.080 --> 00:54:36.560]   I think she knew and believed that God would help her with her troubles.
[00:54:36.560 --> 00:54:42.680]   That's why she laid them there and was content to leave, totally confident that he was going
[00:54:42.680 --> 00:54:43.920]   to answer her prayer.
[00:54:43.920 --> 00:54:48.040]   And you know, we know that Hannah has a high view of God because if you ever read 1 Samuel
[00:54:48.040 --> 00:54:52.400]   2, you'll be blown away because you're, you know, when you read it, you'll say, "Wow,
[00:54:52.400 --> 00:54:54.040]   that just seems really, really familiar."
[00:54:54.040 --> 00:54:59.400]   Because it's what Mary, the mother of Jesus quotes, it's the Magnificat.
[00:54:59.400 --> 00:55:01.320]   But Hannah said it first.
[00:55:01.320 --> 00:55:05.240]   And Mary is remembering that when she reads it.
[00:55:05.240 --> 00:55:07.160]   And it's just wonderful.
[00:55:07.160 --> 00:55:12.080]   So I invite you to read 1 Samuel 2 on your own time because it's just such a wonderful
[00:55:12.080 --> 00:55:13.480]   example.
[00:55:13.480 --> 00:55:15.200]   I think there's really so much to say.
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:18.820]   This topic is kind of, I feel like I'm just scratching the surface.
[00:55:18.820 --> 00:55:23.480]   You can, you know, practically have a whole conference just on this issue.
[00:55:23.480 --> 00:55:29.080]   But as I've kind of already alluded to, you know, I just don't think people know how to
[00:55:29.080 --> 00:55:31.280]   deal with their sadness rightly.
[00:55:31.280 --> 00:55:37.040]   I think they're buying into a lot of worldly messages and they're just not thinking through
[00:55:37.040 --> 00:55:41.520]   how the Bible would define that, how people in the Bible have gotten through that.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:44.480]   I think they're just taking their cues from the world.
[00:55:44.480 --> 00:55:49.000]   And it seems to be these days that it's Medicaid, Medicaid, you know.
[00:55:49.000 --> 00:55:53.880]   And it's kind of sad because it doesn't give you an opportunity to really see what the
[00:55:53.880 --> 00:55:55.640]   Lord has for you.
[00:55:55.640 --> 00:55:59.920]   But anyways, if I were Sarah's counselor, I would just want to make sure that she understood
[00:55:59.920 --> 00:56:05.560]   that the inner man, not her brain, which is what the biological community says is her
[00:56:05.560 --> 00:56:10.440]   source for her thoughts and her intentions and her choices and her emotions, such as
[00:56:10.440 --> 00:56:11.880]   sadness.
[00:56:11.880 --> 00:56:16.040]   And so if there's no organic cause contributing to her sad feelings, then I would encourage
[00:56:16.040 --> 00:56:22.920]   her just to continue to meet with me to see if we can just work through stuff in the Word.
[00:56:22.920 --> 00:56:26.840]   And I think that that would probably solve a lot because I've met with a lot of Sarah's
[00:56:26.840 --> 00:56:31.720]   in my life and I've seen them really work through issues biblically.
[00:56:31.720 --> 00:56:33.320]   So I would encourage you to that end.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:38.520]   Just make sure that, you know, you're faithful with God's Word because Hannah is really an
[00:56:38.520 --> 00:56:44.200]   example of someone that had right praying, she had right actions, and a right response
[00:56:44.200 --> 00:56:46.680]   despite how she felt.
[00:56:46.680 --> 00:56:47.920]   And so we can be like her too.
[00:56:47.920 --> 00:56:52.480]   We can go to the Lord and we can pray, we can worship him, we can cast our burdens upon
[00:56:52.480 --> 00:56:55.800]   him and we can grow in our view of him.
[00:56:55.800 --> 00:56:59.000]   And I gave you some really helpful resources.
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:02.340]   This would be helpful for anyone struggling with depression if you want to kind of get
[00:57:02.340 --> 00:57:03.920]   at it from a biblical point of view.
[00:57:03.920 --> 00:57:06.560]   I already talked about good mood, bad mood.
[00:57:06.560 --> 00:57:11.080]   There's a great book by one of my mentors called Out of the Blues, Dealing with Blues
[00:57:11.080 --> 00:57:14.680]   of Depression and Loneliness by Wayne Mack.
[00:57:14.680 --> 00:57:18.800]   Jay Adams has, I think that's, I don't think it's a book, I think it's a pamphlet called
[00:57:18.800 --> 00:57:21.120]   What to Do About Depression.
[00:57:21.120 --> 00:57:25.040]   Of course, Ed Welch has done a lot of great works on depression, but if you want to just
[00:57:25.040 --> 00:57:30.920]   get the pamphlet, he's got one where you can actually work through it on a homework kind
[00:57:30.920 --> 00:57:31.920]   of way.
[00:57:31.920 --> 00:57:36.920]   And then I just always say, you know, spend some time just memorizing scripture.
[00:57:36.920 --> 00:57:43.680]   Philippians 4.8 being one that's really helpful, where you can just go to God's Word and just
[00:57:43.680 --> 00:57:46.360]   list out 10 specific ways God has blessed you.
[00:57:46.360 --> 00:57:50.220]   I mean, that's the beginning because it's really about how we're thinking.
[00:57:50.220 --> 00:57:51.220]   So there you go.
[00:57:51.220 --> 00:57:52.220]   Man, we've gone through a lot, ladies.
[00:57:52.220 --> 00:57:53.220]   It's a lot.
[00:57:53.220 --> 00:57:56.760]   I don't even know how you're even awake right now.
[00:57:56.760 --> 00:58:03.040]   But you've got tools now, so where much is given, much is required.
[00:58:03.040 --> 00:58:04.640]   So I'm giving you my blessing.
[00:58:04.640 --> 00:58:06.500]   You know, you're equipped.
[00:58:06.500 --> 00:58:14.760]   So go, come alongside, make disciples, be willing, be a willing servant.
[00:58:14.760 --> 00:58:15.760]   Don't fear.
[00:58:15.760 --> 00:58:16.760]   You've got God on your side.
[00:58:16.760 --> 00:58:17.760]   You've got God's Word.
[00:58:17.760 --> 00:58:23.480]   You've got Esther Kim, who's almost ACBC certified, so she's going to be your wisdom on a lot
[00:58:23.480 --> 00:58:24.480]   of these issues.
[00:58:24.480 --> 00:58:27.880]   But thank you for having me and enduring a lot of lecture.
[00:58:27.880 --> 00:58:30.440]   I'm just really impressed by you.
[00:58:30.440 --> 00:58:33.160]   And God bless you, and let me pray for you one last time.
