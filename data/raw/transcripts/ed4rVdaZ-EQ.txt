[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [Music]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   There are few more perplexing questions of the Bible than this.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000]   If he knew that he would betray him in the end,
[00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   why did Jesus choose Judas as a disciple to begin with?
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000]   The perplexing question comes in specifically from a podcast listener named Austin.
[00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   "Hello Pastor John, I've been studying through the book of John lately,
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:30.000]   and I began to wonder why Jesus chose Judas to be one of his disciples in the first place.
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000]   And what does Jesus have to teach us by choosing someone to be his disciple,
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   knowing full well he would betray him?
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000]   Are there any takeaways for us in this?"
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:51.000]   John 6.64 says, "Jesus knew from the beginning who those were who did not believe,
[00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:55.000]   and who it was who would betray him."
[00:00:55.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   So, Austin's question is biblically based and urgent.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Jesus chose his own betrayer to be part of his apostles. Why?
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:15.000]   I'm going to give five answers that I see in the scriptures for why God ordained
[00:01:15.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   and Jesus chose Judas, the betrayer, to be part of his team.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   First, because the Old Testament scriptures prophesied that this would take place.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:32.000]   So Jesus chose Judas to fulfill the scriptures.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   John 13.18, Jesus says to his apostles, "I am not speaking of all of you.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   I know whom I have chosen, but the scripture will be fulfilled."
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   And then he quotes Psalm 41.9, "He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me."
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   And Peter, on the day of Pentecost, Acts 1.16, says, "Brothers, the scripture had to be fulfilled
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   concerning Judas, who became a guide to those who arrested Jesus."
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:20.000]   Step by step, Jesus moved toward the cross, taking pains to fulfill every scripture
[00:02:20.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   concerning his death, right down to the details of how he would be handed over.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:32.000]   The point was to show the scriptures cannot be broken and God is in control.
[00:02:32.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Second, by choosing to be betrayed by a close friend and even by a kiss,
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Jesus shows us that the most despicable act in the history of the world,
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   the betrayal and consequent murder of the Son of God, was part of God's saving plan.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:06.000]   It's explicitly said in Acts 4.27 that by his hand and his predestination, these things took place.
[00:03:06.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   In other words, the lesson of Judas is that the most horrible sins in the world
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   are used by God for his saving purposes.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   Just when people think they're getting the upper hand, they find that their hand is serving
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:27.000]   the very one they are opposing.
[00:03:27.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   That's a great lesson for us to learn.
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:40.000]   Third, by choosing from the beginning an apostle who was destined for apostasy and destruction
[00:03:40.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   and by including him in his closest relations and by giving him power over unclean spirits
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   and over diseases, Jesus shows us that religious associations and religious practices
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:04.000]   and miracle working are no sure evidence of being born again.
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   Matthew 10, verses 1 to 4, describe the choosing of the twelve.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:18.000]   It names Judas and says, "Jesus gave them authority over unclean spirits to cast out
[00:04:18.000 --> 00:04:23.000]   and to heal every disease and every affliction."
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   Judas walked with Jesus, ministered with Jesus for three years, and he worked those miracles.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   So Judas becomes a vivid illustration of the people in Matthew 7, 22.
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:48.000]   "On that day many will say to me, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and
[00:04:48.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   cast out demons in your name and do many mighty works in your name?'"
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   That's Judas and many, many other people in history.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:03.000]   "And then Jesus will declare to them, 'I never knew you.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.000]   Depart from me, you workers of lawlessness.'"
[00:05:07.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   What a vivid lesson to learn that right doctrine, "Lord, Lord"—we know who you are.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   We got our doctrine right.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   "Lord, Lord"—and religious activity and miracle working.
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   We've cast out demons.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:22.000]   We've healed people.
[00:05:22.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   We've proved nothing about saving faith and being born again.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   That's the lesson of Judas.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:38.000]   Fourth, Judas serves as an illustration that predestination and human responsibility go
[00:05:38.000 --> 00:05:39.000]   hand in hand.
[00:05:39.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   Judas' destiny was set before his betrayal.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:54.000]   Jesus said that he kept all his disciples from apostasy except Judas, the son of destruction,
[00:05:54.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   John 17, 12.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:06.000]   In John 6, 64, it says, "Jesus knew from the beginning who it was who would betray
[00:06:06.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   him."
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:15.000]   And then Jesus explains in the next verse, "This is why I told you that no one can come
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:20.000]   to me unless it is granted to him by the Father."
[00:06:20.000 --> 00:06:30.000]   In other words, Judas didn't repent because it was not granted to him by the Father.
[00:06:30.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   His destiny was sealed, and yet he was guilty.
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.000]   Really guilty, really accountable, really blameworthy.
[00:06:40.000 --> 00:06:43.000]   He was really responsible for what he did.
[00:06:43.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   He himself said in Matthew 27, 4, "I have sinned.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   I have sinned by betraying innocent blood."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   So we learn from Judas not to stumble over the fact that a person may be destined for
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:07.000]   destruction and yet totally responsible for what he does.
[00:07:07.000 --> 00:07:16.000]   And finally, number five, Judas serves as a vivid example of the terrible, terrible
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   power of the love of money and how it blinds us to what is true and beautiful and valuable
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:26.000]   in this world.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:39.000]   In John 12, 4 to 6, when Mary anointed Jesus, Judas said, oozing with hypocrisy, "Why
[00:07:39.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   was this ointment not sold for 300 denarii and given to the poor?"
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:52.000]   And John comments, "He said this not because he cared about the poor, but because he was
[00:07:52.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   a thief, and having the charge of the money bag, he used to help himself to what was put
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   in it."
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   Under the nose of the very Son of God, who would give his life as a ransom for many,
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:19.000]   whose teachings he had heard for three years, in whose power he did miracles, Judas loved
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:23.000]   money more than he loved Jesus.
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   That's horrific, unbelievable, unspeakably evil.
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   It should make every one of us tremble at the thought of the power that money has in
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   our lives to blind us to what is true and beautiful and precious.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:51.720]   So, when Judas got his chance, 30 pieces of silver is all it took to sell the very Son
[00:08:51.720 --> 00:08:52.720]   of God.
[00:08:52.720 --> 00:09:00.800]   I'm sure there are more answers to Austin's question, but these are at least five answers
[00:09:00.800 --> 00:09:07.640]   that I see in the Bible as to why God would ordain and Jesus would choose that a betrayer
[00:09:07.640 --> 00:09:11.000]   be included among the apostles from the beginning.
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:13.680]   One, to fulfill Scripture.
[00:09:13.680 --> 00:09:16.600]   Scriptures cannot be broken, and God is in control.
[00:09:16.600 --> 00:09:24.000]   Two, even horrific sins serve the saving purposes of God in his sovereign plan.
[00:09:24.000 --> 00:09:31.800]   Three, time with Jesus and miracle working are no proof of saving faith.
[00:09:31.800 --> 00:09:38.080]   Four, predestination and human accountability go hand in hand.
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:44.800]   And five, the love of money is behind the worst sin in the world.
[00:09:44.800 --> 00:09:45.800]   Amen.
[00:09:45.800 --> 00:09:49.280]   John 12 is an incredible text for a lot of reasons.
[00:09:49.280 --> 00:09:55.680]   Mary pouring out her wealth on the feet of Jesus reminds me of APJ 1499, titled "What
[00:09:55.680 --> 00:09:58.280]   Does Freedom from the Love of Money Look Like?"
[00:09:58.280 --> 00:10:02.000]   Freedom from the love of money looks like Mary at the feet of Jesus.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:04.000]   One of my all-time favorite APJ episodes.
[00:10:04.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   Check that out.
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:08.760]   That's episode 1499 on what it looks like to be free from the love of money.
