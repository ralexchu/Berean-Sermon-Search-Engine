[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   [Music]
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:36.000]   You came down from the heavens so we would know
[00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:48.000]   How deep, how high, how long, how wide, and how far the road goes
[00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:56.000]   You went to the darkest, you went to the darkest of places
[00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   Walked down the loneliest roads
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   You leapt into our sensitive faces
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:12.000]   And pulled us whenever alone
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   You came down from the heavens so we would know
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   How deep, how high, how long, how wide, and how far the road goes
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   From the lowest fields of the earth to the ends of the earth you have been, you have searched for the ones so far from home
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:52.000]   Jesus, you paid the price, what a great sacrifice
[00:01:52.000 --> 00:01:59.000]   For the light to call us to your home
[00:01:59.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   You came down from the heavens so we would know
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   How deep, how high, how long, how wide, and how far the road goes
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:34.000]   How deep, how high, how long, how wide, and how far the road goes
[00:02:34.000 --> 00:02:42.000]   [Music]
