[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.760]   Father, as we study about your Word today, I pray that you would help us just to get
[00:00:05.760 --> 00:00:07.400]   excited.
[00:00:07.400 --> 00:00:16.480]   Lord, that all of your Scriptures, you breathe into it, and we can glean from every page.
[00:00:16.480 --> 00:00:23.880]   Lord, thus far, some pages were more intimidating and daunting and hard to understand than others,
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:29.320]   but I do pray that you would give us a desire to feed off your Word.
[00:00:29.320 --> 00:00:34.920]   Help us to retain everything, and we pray that you would help us to just enjoy our time
[00:00:34.920 --> 00:00:35.920]   together this morning.
[00:00:35.920 --> 00:00:38.720]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:42.700]   So if you guys missed last week, I shared that the goal of the Old Testament survey
[00:00:42.700 --> 00:00:45.880]   is not to teach you the Old Testament.
[00:00:45.880 --> 00:00:49.680]   It's not to lecture, it's not to give you information, but it's to cause you to want
[00:00:49.680 --> 00:00:51.200]   to learn, right?
[00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:56.920]   So my job is not to teach you, but rather to make the Old Testament friendly enough
[00:00:56.920 --> 00:01:00.400]   where you're going to want to learn.
[00:01:00.400 --> 00:01:04.280]   In a sense, I'm trying to defang this Old Testament for you.
[00:01:04.280 --> 00:01:07.880]   And hopefully, like, did you guys hear my voice throughout the week?
[00:01:07.880 --> 00:01:08.880]   Yeah?
[00:01:08.880 --> 00:01:13.080]   Yeah, you saw my jolly face, like, in your head, right?
[00:01:13.080 --> 00:01:15.760]   That's good stuff, okay?
[00:01:15.760 --> 00:01:18.320]   Let's do, like, the OT memory key number one.
[00:01:18.320 --> 00:01:21.000]   What was it?
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   Anybody remember?
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:23.000]   3927, what are those?
[00:01:23.000 --> 00:01:31.160]   That's going to be important in the book of Isaiah also, so it's good to remember three
[00:01:31.160 --> 00:01:32.780]   times nine equals 27.
[00:01:32.780 --> 00:01:35.480]   That one hopefully you don't struggle with.
[00:01:35.480 --> 00:01:41.240]   Big broad timeline of the Old Testament, 2,000, 1,500, 1,500, 500, 1,500.
[00:01:41.240 --> 00:01:43.840]   What do we remember?
[00:01:43.840 --> 00:01:46.120]   I am Dr. Jesus, A-M-D-R, Jesus.
[00:01:46.120 --> 00:01:54.800]   Abraham, Moses, David, Terence, Jesus.
[00:01:54.800 --> 00:02:00.020]   So what are the Old Testament books or how many?
[00:02:00.020 --> 00:02:01.020]   39.
[00:02:01.020 --> 00:02:04.440]   What are the categories?
[00:02:04.440 --> 00:02:06.140]   Five books which are?
[00:02:06.140 --> 00:02:10.700]   Pentateuch, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12, 5, 12, 5, 5, 12.
[00:02:10.700 --> 00:02:12.480]   What's the 12?
[00:02:12.480 --> 00:02:13.480]   History.
[00:02:13.480 --> 00:02:17.120]   Poetry, major prophets, minor prophets.
[00:02:17.120 --> 00:02:20.160]   What was Genesis about?
[00:02:20.160 --> 00:02:21.160]   Big endings.
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:23.800]   How about Exodus?
[00:02:23.800 --> 00:02:28.680]   Exit from Egypt, Leviticus, left foot kiss.
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.840]   Feasts and offerings, numbers.
[00:02:30.840 --> 00:02:31.840]   What are they doing?
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:33.720]   Wilderness wanderings.
[00:02:33.720 --> 00:02:39.160]   They were written to the first generation, okay, of, and it's kind of a description of
[00:02:39.160 --> 00:02:40.160]   what happened.
[00:02:40.160 --> 00:02:42.760]   Deuteronomy, what is it about?
[00:02:42.760 --> 00:02:47.240]   Yeah, do it run on me, a law to the second generation.
[00:02:47.240 --> 00:02:51.280]   So from numbers perspective, people are in the wilderness because they sin.
[00:02:51.280 --> 00:02:53.960]   Deuteronomy perspective, why are they in the wilderness?
[00:02:53.960 --> 00:02:55.200]   Because God put them in there.
[00:02:55.200 --> 00:02:56.760]   Is that a contradiction?
[00:02:56.760 --> 00:02:57.760]   No.
[00:02:57.760 --> 00:03:04.160]   It's just a little hard to understand, but that's right there, okay?
[00:03:04.160 --> 00:03:09.520]   Joshua, conquering general, okay?
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:15.520]   Cycles, there's a judge on a cycle, okay?
[00:03:15.520 --> 00:03:18.960]   Ruth, love story in the time of the judges.
[00:03:18.960 --> 00:03:23.400]   Joshua is 21 chapters, or 24 chapters, 10 years.
[00:03:23.400 --> 00:03:30.320]   Judges is this story again and again, 21 chapters, but 400 years.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:38.440]   MTJK, Moses is at 1500, tribes, judges, and 1000 is kings, right?
[00:03:38.440 --> 00:03:41.160]   You guys remember that.
[00:03:41.160 --> 00:03:44.120]   What are the five R's in the cycle?
[00:03:44.120 --> 00:03:57.760]   Rest, relapse, ruin, repentance, restoration, rest, relapse, ruin, repentance, restoration,
[00:03:57.760 --> 00:03:58.760]   rest.
[00:03:58.760 --> 00:04:03.720]   So you see this cycle, and technically the book of judges may not have ended in some
[00:04:03.720 --> 00:04:04.720]   sense.
[00:04:04.720 --> 00:04:07.640]   We're still in that cycle, right?
[00:04:07.640 --> 00:04:13.240]   What was the half Bible cheer that will help you remember 51% of the whole Bible?
[00:04:13.240 --> 00:04:22.720]   King, king split, A, B, C, D, Medo, Persians, return, and Greeks.
[00:04:22.720 --> 00:04:34.400]   David, Solomon, split, Assyria, Babylon, captivity, destruction, Medo-Persians, let them go, return
[00:04:34.400 --> 00:04:40.280]   one, return two, return three, and then Greeks at 333.
[00:04:40.280 --> 00:04:41.280]   Very good.
[00:04:41.280 --> 00:04:45.080]   And what was that fake king that I made up that will help you remember kings one, six,
[00:04:45.080 --> 00:04:47.200]   11, and 16?
[00:04:47.200 --> 00:04:51.560]   Reho, Rehojo, right?
[00:04:51.560 --> 00:04:54.720]   And you don't need to necessarily remember who they were.
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.240]   I didn't give you that, but it helps.
[00:04:57.240 --> 00:05:07.280]   Jeheboam, Ahaziah, Jotham, Jojo, Josiah, all right?
[00:05:07.280 --> 00:05:11.440]   So we're gonna do a little quick review visually.
[00:05:11.440 --> 00:05:23.720]   There's Abraham, Moses, David returns, and then Jesus, Mount JK, which is Moses, tribes,
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:24.720]   judges, and kings.
[00:05:24.720 --> 00:05:30.560]   And if you guys remember, the five Rs happen in this period.
[00:05:30.560 --> 00:05:33.080]   And so basically half of the Old Testament now you've covered.
[00:05:33.080 --> 00:05:35.120]   We've covered that in one week.
[00:05:35.120 --> 00:05:38.560]   Most of the Old Testament is the king, king split, okay?
[00:05:38.560 --> 00:05:41.640]   So we're gonna talk mostly about that today.
[00:05:41.640 --> 00:05:44.760]   But first things first, I wanna show you a map.
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:50.400]   Our Xerox machine has to have a cleaning, so the copies came out a little bit funky.
[00:05:50.400 --> 00:05:54.200]   So I apologize for that.
[00:05:54.200 --> 00:06:04.080]   But this is a map of Israel in the time of around Joshua, okay?
[00:06:04.080 --> 00:06:09.960]   So you don't need to know who got what, but a couple things that you need to understand,
[00:06:09.960 --> 00:06:11.320]   okay?
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:15.000]   There were 12 tribal territories, okay?
[00:06:15.000 --> 00:06:16.720]   Is that an easy number to remember?
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:20.880]   12 tribal territories, it's like states, okay?
[00:06:20.880 --> 00:06:32.560]   12 states, of the 12, 10 are of the sons of Judah, or Jacob, sorry, sons of Jacob.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:36.320]   And you don't need to remember all of their names.
[00:06:36.320 --> 00:06:42.960]   But one of them is a half tribe, Manasseh from the son of Joseph, and Ephraim, son of
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:44.120]   Joseph.
[00:06:44.120 --> 00:06:50.840]   So Manasseh and Ephraim are Jacob's grandsons, but they get an extra portion of land because
[00:06:50.840 --> 00:06:53.920]   who's their daddy?
[00:06:53.920 --> 00:06:58.840]   Their dad's the one responsible for all the provision in Egypt, right?
[00:06:58.840 --> 00:07:04.660]   So you have 10 sons of Jacob, and then Manasseh and Ephraim, okay?
[00:07:04.660 --> 00:07:08.580]   So technically you have 11 sons of Jacob represented.
[00:07:08.580 --> 00:07:10.680]   Who doesn't get a land?
[00:07:10.680 --> 00:07:14.320]   The Levites don't get a land.
[00:07:14.320 --> 00:07:20.960]   But in some sense, though they don't have a land, they are the richest tribe, okay?
[00:07:20.960 --> 00:07:28.200]   So they got 48 cities all throughout Israel.
[00:07:28.200 --> 00:07:36.920]   So on average, per tribal state, how many cities do the Levites dwell in?
[00:07:36.920 --> 00:07:40.320]   About four.
[00:07:40.320 --> 00:07:42.240]   And there are six cities of refuge.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.960]   So if you accidentally kill somebody and you need to come under the protection of the Levites,
[00:07:47.960 --> 00:07:51.280]   they were six, okay?
[00:07:51.280 --> 00:07:57.320]   So they were three on one side of the Jordan River, three on the other.
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:06.280]   And wherever you were, if you needed refuge for your accidental sin, you could get that.
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:13.120]   So you have six cities of refuge, three on the east of the Jordan, three on the west.
[00:08:13.120 --> 00:08:14.620]   All right.
[00:08:14.620 --> 00:08:19.000]   This one, you have to actually do a little bit of mental gymnastics, all right?
[00:08:19.000 --> 00:08:21.700]   Here we go.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.040]   How many tribal territories were there?
[00:08:24.040 --> 00:08:25.960]   Don't look at your paper.
[00:08:25.960 --> 00:08:26.960]   12.
[00:08:26.960 --> 00:08:29.280]   How many of them were sons of Joseph?
[00:08:29.280 --> 00:08:30.760]   Sons of Jacob?
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:32.000]   10.
[00:08:32.000 --> 00:08:33.160]   And then there was a half tribe.
[00:08:33.160 --> 00:08:34.920]   What were they called?
[00:08:34.920 --> 00:08:37.480]   Manasseh, and a half tribe of?
[00:08:37.480 --> 00:08:38.480]   Ephraim.
[00:08:38.480 --> 00:08:40.520]   Who had no land?
[00:08:40.520 --> 00:08:42.800]   How many sons of Jacob got land?
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:44.040]   10.
[00:08:44.040 --> 00:08:45.860]   Or 11.
[00:08:45.860 --> 00:08:48.120]   But one of them became half tribes.
[00:08:48.120 --> 00:08:51.120]   And what are the half tribes of Joseph called?
[00:08:51.120 --> 00:08:54.160]   Manasseh, Ephraim.
[00:08:54.160 --> 00:08:57.080]   What tribe got no land?
[00:08:57.080 --> 00:08:58.300]   Levites.
[00:08:58.300 --> 00:09:00.880]   How many cities, though, did the Levites occupy?
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.880]   48.
[00:09:01.880 --> 00:09:02.880]   That was not their land.
[00:09:02.880 --> 00:09:08.560]   They had dwelt in the land of one of the other tribes, but they were there as priests, right?
[00:09:08.560 --> 00:09:12.520]   And how many cities all throughout Israel were there cities of refuge?
[00:09:12.520 --> 00:09:13.520]   Six.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.720]   Three on one side of the river, three on the other.
[00:09:16.720 --> 00:09:17.720]   Okay?
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:23.240]   So I'm going to come up with a seventh key, and this one is just to help you remember
[00:09:23.240 --> 00:09:29.000]   the geography, okay?
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:34.800]   So the first key that you remember for the bodies of water is this phrase.
[00:09:34.800 --> 00:09:40.120]   Gals, Jordan is dead.
[00:09:40.120 --> 00:09:41.720]   Okay?
[00:09:41.720 --> 00:09:46.240]   Gals, Jordan's dead.
[00:09:46.240 --> 00:09:47.760]   Now why do I say that?
[00:09:47.760 --> 00:09:54.040]   The topmost body of water that you see there, okay, or the big body of water is the Sea
[00:09:54.040 --> 00:09:56.960]   of Galilee, okay?
[00:09:56.960 --> 00:10:00.320]   And what's running straight down the middle?
[00:10:00.320 --> 00:10:01.320]   Jordan River.
[00:10:01.320 --> 00:10:03.160]   And what's at the bottom?
[00:10:03.160 --> 00:10:04.160]   Dead Sea.
[00:10:04.160 --> 00:10:05.160]   Okay?
[00:10:05.160 --> 00:10:09.720]   So if you think of Israel and there's bodies of water right in the middle, how many cities
[00:10:09.720 --> 00:10:11.640]   on the west for the refuge?
[00:10:11.640 --> 00:10:12.640]   Three.
[00:10:12.640 --> 00:10:14.160]   How many cities on the east?
[00:10:14.160 --> 00:10:15.360]   Three.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:20.600]   Sea of Galilee, Jordan, dead sea.
[00:10:20.600 --> 00:10:21.600]   Okay?
[00:10:21.600 --> 00:10:22.600]   So just remember this.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:27.600]   The land is divided, half of this place is fertile, half of this place is fertile, because
[00:10:27.600 --> 00:10:29.600]   they're all surrounded by water.
[00:10:29.600 --> 00:10:34.960]   Galilee, Jordan, dead sea.
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:37.440]   So he's sad about this.
[00:10:37.440 --> 00:10:40.160]   All right?
[00:10:40.160 --> 00:10:41.160]   But whodunit?
[00:10:41.160 --> 00:10:49.040]   Dun, dun, dun.
[00:10:49.040 --> 00:10:51.760]   Here I am, me, Phil.
[00:10:51.760 --> 00:10:55.880]   Is how you remember the territories around Israel.
[00:10:55.880 --> 00:10:56.880]   Okay?
[00:10:56.880 --> 00:11:01.120]   These guys are all throughout the Old Testament.
[00:11:01.120 --> 00:11:08.520]   So HI, if you look at your map, it's the Hittites.
[00:11:08.520 --> 00:11:14.720]   The AR is the, who are they?
[00:11:14.720 --> 00:11:15.720]   Aramaeans.
[00:11:15.720 --> 00:11:16.720]   Ammonites.
[00:11:16.720 --> 00:11:17.720]   Okay?
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:25.760]   So you have here I am, so Phil Jackson became a little bit like Scottish or Irish, whichever
[00:11:25.760 --> 00:11:27.840]   way my accent lands.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:28.840]   Okay?
[00:11:28.840 --> 00:11:30.940]   Here I am.
[00:11:30.940 --> 00:11:32.360]   The next one, me.
[00:11:32.360 --> 00:11:33.360]   Who's M?
[00:11:33.360 --> 00:11:34.360]   Moabites.
[00:11:34.360 --> 00:11:35.360]   E, Edomites.
[00:11:35.360 --> 00:11:44.760]   And who's the biggest pain in the butt for all the Israelites throughout a lot of their
[00:11:44.760 --> 00:11:45.880]   history?
[00:11:45.880 --> 00:11:47.800]   The Philistines.
[00:11:47.800 --> 00:11:52.560]   So gals, Jordan is dead.
[00:11:52.560 --> 00:11:54.720]   See a Galilee.
[00:11:54.720 --> 00:11:56.480]   Jordan River.
[00:11:56.480 --> 00:11:57.480]   Dead sea.
[00:11:57.480 --> 00:11:58.480]   Whodunit?
[00:11:58.480 --> 00:12:01.480]   Here I am, me, Phil.
[00:12:01.480 --> 00:12:02.480]   Okay?
[00:12:02.480 --> 00:12:03.480]   Hittites.
[00:12:03.480 --> 00:12:04.480]   Aramaeans.
[00:12:04.480 --> 00:12:05.480]   Ammonites.
[00:12:05.480 --> 00:12:06.480]   Here.
[00:12:06.480 --> 00:12:07.480]   Me, Moabites.
[00:12:07.480 --> 00:12:08.480]   Edomites.
[00:12:08.480 --> 00:12:09.480]   Philistines.
[00:12:09.480 --> 00:12:18.920]   Do you guys think you can kind of remember who's where?
[00:12:18.920 --> 00:12:20.440]   Yeah?
[00:12:20.440 --> 00:12:23.000]   So geography, Israelite geography, what's down the middle?
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   What three bodies of water?
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.120]   Galilee, Jordan, dead sea.
[00:12:30.120 --> 00:12:34.120]   Then going clockwise, you have the Hittites.
[00:12:34.120 --> 00:12:36.120]   Here are Aramaeans.
[00:12:36.120 --> 00:12:38.120]   Am, Ammonites.
[00:12:38.120 --> 00:12:39.120]   Hittites.
[00:12:39.120 --> 00:12:40.120]   Moabites.
[00:12:40.120 --> 00:12:41.120]   Edomites.
[00:12:41.120 --> 00:12:42.120]   Philistines.
[00:12:42.120 --> 00:12:43.120]   Okay?
[00:12:43.120 --> 00:12:48.240]   If you guys actually had to study for this, you probably would ace this test.
[00:12:48.240 --> 00:12:50.400]   It's not hard for the geography.
[00:12:50.400 --> 00:12:51.400]   Got it?
[00:12:51.400 --> 00:13:01.160]   These guys are constantly harassments and nuisances to the country of Israel.
[00:13:01.160 --> 00:13:03.000]   Okay?
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:07.520]   Hopefully so far you guys are still with me.
[00:13:07.520 --> 00:13:10.320]   Any questions?
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:15.360]   Easy enough to remember?
[00:13:15.360 --> 00:13:19.000]   Okay.
[00:13:19.000 --> 00:13:26.840]   So we have our first book that we're gonna cover today.
[00:13:26.840 --> 00:13:29.200]   You have one sand mule.
[00:13:29.200 --> 00:13:30.700]   Right?
[00:13:30.700 --> 00:13:34.800]   There's only one mule that is made out of sand.
[00:13:34.800 --> 00:13:37.000]   One sand mule.
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:40.400]   And what does this dude have in his hand?
[00:13:40.400 --> 00:13:41.960]   He has a saw.
[00:13:41.960 --> 00:13:42.960]   Right?
[00:13:42.960 --> 00:13:50.760]   So this whole book is mostly concentrated on King Saul.
[00:13:50.760 --> 00:13:53.080]   Okay?
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.680]   But before you get Saul, you have Samuel.
[00:13:55.680 --> 00:14:00.480]   And you don't want to kind of neglect this story because one thing is you guys who's
[00:14:00.480 --> 00:14:01.880]   Hannah?
[00:14:01.880 --> 00:14:04.200]   Anybody know?
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:05.560]   Samuel's mom.
[00:14:05.560 --> 00:14:11.400]   And what is her biggest complaint to the Lord for most of her marriage?
[00:14:11.400 --> 00:14:12.440]   She's not having a baby.
[00:14:12.440 --> 00:14:14.920]   So she goes to the temple and she's praying.
[00:14:14.920 --> 00:14:15.920]   There's no temple.
[00:14:15.920 --> 00:14:24.360]   She goes to, I guess it's like a gathering and she's praying.
[00:14:24.360 --> 00:14:28.200]   And she's praying for a baby and she promises God, "If you give me a baby, I will devote
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:30.360]   him to your service."
[00:14:30.360 --> 00:14:32.920]   And then she has other kids after that.
[00:14:32.920 --> 00:14:35.880]   But you don't know actually how Hannah dies.
[00:14:35.880 --> 00:14:36.880]   Right?
[00:14:36.880 --> 00:14:38.960]   She just disappears.
[00:14:38.960 --> 00:14:49.400]   But I wonder if Hannah was able to see her son anoint the very first king of Israel.
[00:14:49.400 --> 00:14:55.920]   Wouldn't that be so cool if we got an extra insight into scripture?
[00:14:55.920 --> 00:15:02.200]   So every little story and detail in scripture is not wasted.
[00:15:02.200 --> 00:15:07.440]   But Hannah prays to the Lord and then you get a prophet in Samuel.
[00:15:07.440 --> 00:15:09.560]   He anoints the first king of Israel.
[00:15:09.560 --> 00:15:10.560]   What's his name?
[00:15:10.560 --> 00:15:11.560]   Saul.
[00:15:11.560 --> 00:15:13.600]   And remember how many years did he reign?
[00:15:13.600 --> 00:15:14.600]   Around 40.
[00:15:14.600 --> 00:15:16.800]   40, 40, 40.
[00:15:16.800 --> 00:15:18.160]   Right?
[00:15:18.160 --> 00:15:23.040]   So just remember first Samuel, one Samuel.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:24.040]   What's it about?
[00:15:24.040 --> 00:15:25.040]   Saul.
[00:15:25.040 --> 00:15:26.040]   Okay?
[00:15:26.040 --> 00:15:27.040]   One Samuel.
[00:15:27.040 --> 00:15:28.040]   Saul.
[00:15:28.040 --> 00:15:29.040]   Okay?
[00:15:29.040 --> 00:15:37.320]   What was the northern most major body of water in Israel?
[00:15:37.320 --> 00:15:39.080]   Galilee.
[00:15:39.080 --> 00:15:40.320]   What's the river?
[00:15:40.320 --> 00:15:41.320]   Jordan.
[00:15:41.320 --> 00:15:42.320]   And what's at the bottom?
[00:15:42.320 --> 00:15:43.320]   Dead Sea.
[00:15:43.320 --> 00:15:46.080]   Who are the nations surrounding them?
[00:15:46.080 --> 00:15:54.480]   Hittites, Arameans, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Philistines against the ocean.
[00:15:54.480 --> 00:15:55.800]   Okay?
[00:15:55.800 --> 00:15:56.800]   What's Saul about?
[00:15:56.800 --> 00:15:57.800]   What's first Samuel about?
[00:15:57.800 --> 00:15:58.800]   Saul.
[00:15:58.800 --> 00:16:02.560]   All right, here we go.
[00:16:02.560 --> 00:16:06.480]   There are two Samuels in this picture.
[00:16:06.480 --> 00:16:08.240]   Okay?
[00:16:08.240 --> 00:16:17.680]   And there are two Samuels and in front of these two Samuels, there's a guy who is wholehearted,
[00:16:17.680 --> 00:16:21.800]   who has a sling, who has a harp.
[00:16:21.800 --> 00:16:23.880]   Okay?
[00:16:23.880 --> 00:16:26.880]   Who's second Samuel all about?
[00:16:26.880 --> 00:16:28.480]   David.
[00:16:28.480 --> 00:16:30.040]   What's one Samuel about?
[00:16:30.040 --> 00:16:31.040]   Saul.
[00:16:31.040 --> 00:16:33.240]   Two Samuels about?
[00:16:33.240 --> 00:16:34.240]   David.
[00:16:34.240 --> 00:16:35.240]   Okay?
[00:16:35.240 --> 00:16:40.280]   So, remember this picture, because it's going to come up again.
[00:16:40.280 --> 00:16:43.520]   This is a king with a whole heart before the Lord.
[00:16:43.520 --> 00:16:44.680]   He's got a sling.
[00:16:44.680 --> 00:16:49.720]   He's got a harp.
[00:16:49.720 --> 00:16:55.480]   Now, this is one king.
[00:16:55.480 --> 00:16:56.880]   All right?
[00:16:56.880 --> 00:16:59.200]   First kings, one king.
[00:16:59.200 --> 00:17:02.720]   What's his heart like?
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:03.720]   It's half.
[00:17:03.720 --> 00:17:04.720]   Okay?
[00:17:04.720 --> 00:17:10.120]   He is not wholehearted like the first guy.
[00:17:10.120 --> 00:17:11.920]   Okay?
[00:17:11.920 --> 00:17:20.960]   This is about a half-hearted Solomon, and what caused his heart to be halved?
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:21.960]   The women behind him.
[00:17:21.960 --> 00:17:22.960]   How many...
[00:17:22.960 --> 00:17:23.960]   Do you know...
[00:17:23.960 --> 00:17:24.960]   Anybody know how many wives he had?
[00:17:24.960 --> 00:17:25.960]   700.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:26.960]   How many concubines?
[00:17:26.960 --> 00:17:27.960]   300.
[00:17:27.960 --> 00:17:34.560]   And they were from all different cultures, all different nations.
[00:17:34.560 --> 00:17:42.320]   So he amassed an army of wives, and they turned his heart away, it says in first Kings 11.
[00:17:42.320 --> 00:17:50.280]   He also has wealth, but that wealth, it's a little bit split, because he has so much
[00:17:50.280 --> 00:17:53.100]   of it.
[00:17:53.100 --> 00:17:54.940]   And he has a mic there.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:59.160]   So you can also think of him doing songs.
[00:17:59.160 --> 00:18:06.080]   He did 1,005 songs, 3,000 poems and wise sayings.
[00:18:06.080 --> 00:18:07.180]   Okay?
[00:18:07.180 --> 00:18:09.040]   What is 1 Samuel about?
[00:18:09.040 --> 00:18:10.040]   Saul.
[00:18:10.040 --> 00:18:11.640]   2 Samuel.
[00:18:11.640 --> 00:18:12.720]   David.
[00:18:12.720 --> 00:18:16.640]   One king, first kings, is about Solomon.
[00:18:16.640 --> 00:18:17.640]   Okay?
[00:18:17.640 --> 00:18:19.340]   So king, king, king.
[00:18:19.340 --> 00:18:23.520]   And then we kind of have those three books now covered.
[00:18:23.520 --> 00:18:24.640]   All right?
[00:18:24.640 --> 00:18:28.040]   So how many cities did the Levites get?
[00:18:28.040 --> 00:18:29.520]   48.
[00:18:29.520 --> 00:18:30.600]   Okay?
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:35.320]   And how many sons of Jacob got land?
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:39.240]   11, but one of them was half.
[00:18:39.240 --> 00:18:41.840]   Manasseh, Ephraim.
[00:18:41.840 --> 00:18:44.560]   The Levites got no land, but they got 48 cities.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:46.840]   How many cities of refuge were there?
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:47.840]   Six.
[00:18:47.840 --> 00:18:53.360]   Three on one side of the Jordan, and then three on the other side of the Jordan.
[00:18:53.360 --> 00:18:54.800]   Where's the Jordan?
[00:18:54.800 --> 00:18:59.560]   It's running between the Sea of Galilee and the Dead Sea.
[00:18:59.560 --> 00:19:04.160]   Moses, tribes, judges, kings.
[00:19:04.160 --> 00:19:06.160]   All right?
[00:19:06.160 --> 00:19:08.200]   So we did the judges already.
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:10.060]   Now we're starting kings.
[00:19:10.060 --> 00:19:12.160]   Who was the first king of Israel?
[00:19:12.160 --> 00:19:15.080]   The human king, the human choice?
[00:19:15.080 --> 00:19:16.080]   Saul.
[00:19:16.080 --> 00:19:19.000]   What book of the Bible is about Saul?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:20.000]   1 Samuel.
[00:19:20.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   Okay?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.520]   Now how about the king after him is David.
[00:19:25.520 --> 00:19:28.160]   What book is all about David?
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:30.520]   2 Samuel.
[00:19:30.520 --> 00:19:31.680]   Okay?
[00:19:31.680 --> 00:19:32.680]   What's his heart like?
[00:19:32.680 --> 00:19:34.900]   Whole or half?
[00:19:34.900 --> 00:19:37.460]   His son, Solomon.
[00:19:37.460 --> 00:19:41.400]   What book of the Bible basically just talks all about Solomon?
[00:19:41.400 --> 00:19:42.400]   First Kings.
[00:19:42.400 --> 00:19:46.200]   And in that picture, you have the women, the money, and the mic.
[00:19:46.200 --> 00:19:47.200]   Okay?
[00:19:47.200 --> 00:19:48.560]   All of them were 40 years.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:50.000]   Saul, 40.
[00:19:50.000 --> 00:19:51.640]   David, 40.
[00:19:51.640 --> 00:19:52.640]   Solomon, 40.
[00:19:52.640 --> 00:19:55.040]   Saul's technically 42, but just kind of...
[00:19:55.040 --> 00:19:56.960]   It's easy to remember, 40, 40, 40.
[00:19:56.960 --> 00:19:59.440]   And what year was David king?
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:00.440]   1010.
[00:20:00.440 --> 00:20:02.520]   You guys following me?
[00:20:02.520 --> 00:20:05.000]   Okay, so it's easy to track.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:09.320]   So we're gonna talk about these three kings for a little bit because they are important.
[00:20:09.320 --> 00:20:11.720]   They have whole books devoted to them.
[00:20:11.720 --> 00:20:12.760]   Okay?
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:16.960]   The first key that you wanna remember is bad Saul.
[00:20:16.960 --> 00:20:17.960]   Okay?
[00:20:17.960 --> 00:20:19.400]   Saul is bad.
[00:20:19.400 --> 00:20:23.640]   If you guys are more Netflix savvy, Breaking Bad, and there's a guy named Saul, just think
[00:20:23.640 --> 00:20:24.640]   bad Saul.
[00:20:24.640 --> 00:20:26.100]   All right?
[00:20:26.100 --> 00:20:28.480]   What do you need to remember about Saul?
[00:20:28.480 --> 00:20:30.220]   First of all, he's a Benjaminite.
[00:20:30.220 --> 00:20:37.200]   That's not a good thing because the book of Judges, the worst tribe ever to be because
[00:20:37.200 --> 00:20:38.200]   they...
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:41.360]   Of all the people that went into relapse, they went the worst.
[00:20:41.360 --> 00:20:43.600]   All right?
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:46.240]   Do you wanna know why?
[00:20:46.240 --> 00:20:47.240]   You look it up.
[00:20:47.240 --> 00:20:48.240]   Okay?
[00:20:48.240 --> 00:20:50.960]   They were the worst.
[00:20:50.960 --> 00:20:55.960]   So all of this history, Benjamin was the worst, but they got the first king.
[00:20:55.960 --> 00:20:57.520]   So he's a Benjaminite.
[00:20:57.520 --> 00:20:58.520]   Okay?
[00:20:58.520 --> 00:21:02.520]   The second one, his hallmark was arrogance.
[00:21:02.520 --> 00:21:07.960]   He didn't start out arrogant, but he became so full of himself, he started making statues
[00:21:07.960 --> 00:21:09.520]   in his own image.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:10.560]   Right?
[00:21:10.560 --> 00:21:14.960]   This guy who hid when Samuel came up to him and says, "You're gonna lead the nation."
[00:21:14.960 --> 00:21:16.320]   He's gonna be, "Who am I?
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:18.680]   I am from the tribe of Benjamin.
[00:21:18.680 --> 00:21:21.240]   I am even from the least of the families of Benjamin.
[00:21:21.240 --> 00:21:22.900]   How can I lead my people?"
[00:21:22.900 --> 00:21:23.900]   But he's like huge.
[00:21:23.900 --> 00:21:27.160]   He's like a head taller than everybody, and he's hiding behind these crates.
[00:21:27.160 --> 00:21:28.160]   Okay?
[00:21:28.160 --> 00:21:30.280]   But he's arrogant.
[00:21:30.280 --> 00:21:38.660]   He didn't necessarily start out that way, and he was disqualified because of his disobedience.
[00:21:38.660 --> 00:21:40.200]   How do you remember Saul?
[00:21:40.200 --> 00:21:41.200]   Bad.
[00:21:41.200 --> 00:21:42.200]   B. Benjaminite.
[00:21:42.200 --> 00:21:43.200]   A. Arrogance.
[00:21:43.200 --> 00:21:44.200]   D. Disobedience.
[00:21:44.200 --> 00:21:49.680]   What's at the top of the map?
[00:21:49.680 --> 00:21:50.680]   What ocean?
[00:21:50.680 --> 00:21:51.680]   What body of water?
[00:21:51.680 --> 00:21:52.680]   Sea of Galilee.
[00:21:52.680 --> 00:21:53.680]   What's running down?
[00:21:53.680 --> 00:21:54.680]   Jordan.
[00:21:54.680 --> 00:21:55.680]   What's in the middle?
[00:21:55.680 --> 00:21:56.680]   Jordan's in the middle.
[00:21:56.680 --> 00:21:58.240]   What's at the bottom?
[00:21:58.240 --> 00:21:59.240]   The Dead Sea.
[00:21:59.240 --> 00:22:00.800]   What's surrounding them?
[00:22:00.800 --> 00:22:01.800]   Hi.
[00:22:01.800 --> 00:22:02.800]   Hittites.
[00:22:02.800 --> 00:22:03.800]   Ar.
[00:22:03.800 --> 00:22:04.800]   Arum.
[00:22:04.800 --> 00:22:05.800]   Am.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:06.800]   Ammonite.
[00:22:06.800 --> 00:22:07.800]   M. Me.
[00:22:07.800 --> 00:22:08.800]   And then?
[00:22:08.800 --> 00:22:14.080]   And Philistines are bordering what?
[00:22:14.080 --> 00:22:15.320]   The Mediterranean Sea.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:16.320]   Okay?
[00:22:16.320 --> 00:22:17.960]   What's the book of 1 Samuel about?
[00:22:17.960 --> 00:22:18.960]   Saul.
[00:22:18.960 --> 00:22:21.440]   What's the book of 2 Samuel about?
[00:22:21.440 --> 00:22:23.160]   What's the book of 1 Kings about?
[00:22:23.160 --> 00:22:24.160]   Solomon.
[00:22:24.160 --> 00:22:25.160]   Easy enough.
[00:22:25.160 --> 00:22:26.840]   What do you need to remember about Saul?
[00:22:26.840 --> 00:22:27.840]   Bad.
[00:22:27.840 --> 00:22:28.840]   Benjaminite?
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:29.840]   Arrogance.
[00:22:29.840 --> 00:22:30.840]   Disobedience.
[00:22:30.840 --> 00:22:33.120]   And just do the math.
[00:22:33.120 --> 00:22:37.280]   If David's 1010, when was Saul king?
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:40.360]   1052, okay?
[00:22:40.360 --> 00:22:42.360]   To 1010.
[00:22:42.360 --> 00:22:44.760]   And he was disqualified.
[00:22:44.760 --> 00:22:47.800]   Here it says, "But now your kingdom shall not endure.
[00:22:47.800 --> 00:22:52.800]   The Lord has sought out for himself a man after his own heart, and the Lord has appointed
[00:22:52.800 --> 00:22:57.880]   him as a ruler over his people, because you have not kept what the Lord has commanded
[00:22:57.880 --> 00:22:58.880]   you."
[00:22:58.880 --> 00:23:01.640]   And then he goes on to say, "To obey is better than sacrifice.
[00:23:01.640 --> 00:23:03.720]   To heed better than the fat of lambs."
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:05.640]   So Saul's disqualified.
[00:23:05.640 --> 00:23:10.000]   So even though he's Israel's first king, God's first choice is not Saul.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:12.480]   That's why the King-King split starts with who?
[00:23:12.480 --> 00:23:13.480]   David.
[00:23:13.480 --> 00:23:14.480]   And what year?
[00:23:14.480 --> 00:23:18.120]   1010, okay?
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.040]   So what book is all about David?
[00:23:21.040 --> 00:23:24.040]   2 Samuel.
[00:23:24.040 --> 00:23:26.020]   There's another one, but we'll get to that.
[00:23:26.020 --> 00:23:27.360]   How do you remember David?
[00:23:27.360 --> 00:23:31.280]   Made in America David.
[00:23:31.280 --> 00:23:34.680]   So just think of Saul.
[00:23:34.680 --> 00:23:35.680]   What do you remember him by?
[00:23:35.680 --> 00:23:36.680]   Bad.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:38.240]   How about David?
[00:23:38.240 --> 00:23:39.440]   Made in America David.
[00:23:39.440 --> 00:23:44.160]   First of all, he united the 12 tribes.
[00:23:44.160 --> 00:23:47.480]   For those 400 years, guess what the tribes were?
[00:23:47.480 --> 00:23:50.360]   Little countries.
[00:23:50.360 --> 00:23:54.800]   All of them had just religious cities.
[00:23:54.800 --> 00:24:00.040]   They had culture, but they had affiliations mostly toward their ancestors.
[00:24:00.040 --> 00:24:01.560]   They were all different tribes.
[00:24:01.560 --> 00:24:05.160]   Judges came from all different kinds of tribes.
[00:24:05.160 --> 00:24:09.840]   David was the first one to just unite them all.
[00:24:09.840 --> 00:24:13.040]   This is like the United States of David.
[00:24:13.040 --> 00:24:15.600]   The UTD, United Tribes of David.
[00:24:15.600 --> 00:24:17.320]   So what did he do?
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:18.320]   You united.
[00:24:18.320 --> 00:24:21.960]   And what's the next one?
[00:24:21.960 --> 00:24:28.860]   He established Jerusalem as the capital and the center of worship to Yahweh.
[00:24:28.860 --> 00:24:31.320]   He established Jerusalem.
[00:24:31.320 --> 00:24:34.280]   Where did the people worship before?
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:37.000]   Wherever the Levites gathered.
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:44.880]   But now there was a city where people can get together and that could be the capital
[00:24:44.880 --> 00:24:49.680]   of the United Tribes of David and where they could offer worship to God.
[00:24:49.680 --> 00:24:51.960]   And David says, "I want to build a temple."
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:53.920]   But does God say yes or no?
[00:24:53.920 --> 00:24:57.240]   He says, "No, thank you very much because you are a man of blood."
[00:24:57.240 --> 00:24:58.800]   So what was David?
[00:24:58.800 --> 00:25:06.640]   David, all the tribes, for the first time, established where?
[00:25:06.640 --> 00:25:07.640]   Jerusalem.
[00:25:07.640 --> 00:25:10.840]   See, it's better than UEA, right?
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.840]   USA.
[00:25:11.840 --> 00:25:13.040]   Here we go.
[00:25:13.040 --> 00:25:21.320]   And then the last one, he assembled masses of armies.
[00:25:21.320 --> 00:25:22.320]   It's interesting.
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:26.760]   He loved the Lord so fiercely.
[00:25:26.760 --> 00:25:31.680]   His family members called him arrogant, but God calls him humble.
[00:25:31.680 --> 00:25:37.480]   But his passion and love for the Lord inspired everybody.
[00:25:37.480 --> 00:25:45.840]   So everybody from every tribe flocked to fight for him.
[00:25:45.840 --> 00:25:52.640]   And if you look at 2 Samuel 23, you have this list of mighty, mighty, mighty men and soldiers.
[00:25:52.640 --> 00:25:57.880]   There's one guy named Joseph Basheboth from Tachman.
[00:25:57.880 --> 00:26:04.600]   This guy killed 800 soldiers by himself in one battle with one spear.
[00:26:04.600 --> 00:26:07.200]   That's like a crazy, that's crazy skill.
[00:26:07.200 --> 00:26:08.600]   Right?
[00:26:08.600 --> 00:26:10.560]   800.
[00:26:10.560 --> 00:26:14.120]   And there's a list of all of the soldiers that fought for David.
[00:26:14.120 --> 00:26:19.840]   They even risked his life when David was like, "Man, I'm stinking thirsty."
[00:26:19.840 --> 00:26:23.720]   His mighty men go out into enemy territory, risk their lives to get him a cup of water.
[00:26:23.720 --> 00:26:24.720]   Does he drink it?
[00:26:24.720 --> 00:26:25.720]   No, he spills it out.
[00:26:25.720 --> 00:26:27.200]   He's like, "Ah."
[00:26:27.200 --> 00:26:31.680]   But you know one of those mighty men, he slept with his wife.
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:35.400]   If you actually look at the list of mighty men, at the bottom it says Uriah the Hittite.
[00:26:35.400 --> 00:26:39.880]   See, if you actually know what to look for in the Bible, it's a lot of fun.
[00:26:39.880 --> 00:26:42.480]   There's so much drama.
[00:26:42.480 --> 00:26:45.320]   There is a lot of dirty people.
[00:26:45.320 --> 00:26:46.360]   Okay?
[00:26:46.360 --> 00:26:54.080]   So Saul, Benjamin, arrogance, disobedience.
[00:26:54.080 --> 00:26:57.320]   It's interesting that the tribe of Benjamin actually is good in the New Testament because
[00:26:57.320 --> 00:27:00.400]   they're the only other tribe that can trace their lineage.
[00:27:00.400 --> 00:27:04.560]   That's why in Philippians 3 when Paul says, "I am from the tribe of Benjamin, a Hebrew
[00:27:04.560 --> 00:27:07.240]   of Hebrews," later Benjamin becomes good.
[00:27:07.240 --> 00:27:08.240]   Okay?
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.400]   But for Saul's purposes, Benjaminite, arrogance, disobedience.
[00:27:13.400 --> 00:27:14.400]   How about David?
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:15.400]   USA, right?
[00:27:15.400 --> 00:27:18.160]   He united the 12 tribes.
[00:27:18.160 --> 00:27:21.080]   He established Jerusalem as the capital of worship.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:24.320]   And then, armies.
[00:27:24.320 --> 00:27:32.400]   Saul had problems raising fighters, but he was such a big guy, he had no problem fighting
[00:27:32.400 --> 00:27:33.600]   by himself.
[00:27:33.600 --> 00:27:38.200]   But David had major armies from every tribe.
[00:27:38.200 --> 00:27:39.840]   They loved him.
[00:27:39.840 --> 00:27:42.640]   And that's one of the reasons Saul hated him.
[00:27:42.640 --> 00:27:43.640]   Okay?
[00:27:43.640 --> 00:27:47.120]   So, you guys, so what book is about Saul?
[00:27:47.120 --> 00:27:48.120]   First Samuel.
[00:27:48.120 --> 00:27:49.120]   What book is about David?
[00:27:49.120 --> 00:27:53.040]   Well, and there's another book, but second Samuel.
[00:27:53.040 --> 00:27:56.640]   What's at the top of a body of water?
[00:27:56.640 --> 00:28:08.600]   Galilee, Jordan, Dead Sea, Hittites, Aramaeans, Ammonites, Moabites, Edomites, Philistines.
[00:28:08.600 --> 00:28:12.280]   The Hittites actually later become the Phoenicians, all right?
[00:28:12.280 --> 00:28:16.040]   So just think Phil Jackson, Phoenix Suns, but the Hittites disappear and they become
[00:28:16.040 --> 00:28:17.040]   the Phoenicians.
[00:28:17.040 --> 00:28:18.440]   That's the only major change.
[00:28:18.440 --> 00:28:19.440]   Okay?
[00:28:19.440 --> 00:28:22.240]   How many tribes have land?
[00:28:22.240 --> 00:28:28.600]   Twelve, but one of them is a half-tribe of Joseph, or half-tribe of Manasseh, half-tribe
[00:28:28.600 --> 00:28:29.600]   of Edom.
[00:28:29.600 --> 00:28:32.120]   How many cities do the Levites get?
[00:28:32.120 --> 00:28:34.740]   48, all over Israel.
[00:28:34.740 --> 00:28:38.000]   But how many of the 48 cities are cities of refuge?
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:39.000]   Six.
[00:28:39.000 --> 00:28:40.360]   Three on this side of what river?
[00:28:40.360 --> 00:28:41.360]   Jordan.
[00:28:41.360 --> 00:28:42.360]   Jordan, what side of this river?
[00:28:42.360 --> 00:28:43.360]   Jordan.
[00:28:43.360 --> 00:28:47.520]   You got to pay attention to what I mean, all right?
[00:28:47.520 --> 00:28:50.320]   That's Pastor Peter Kim's favorite quote.
[00:28:50.320 --> 00:28:53.000]   Saul, bad.
[00:28:53.000 --> 00:28:58.240]   Benjamin, arrogance, disobedience.
[00:28:58.240 --> 00:29:05.560]   David united the tribes, established Jerusalem, and assembled armies.
[00:29:05.560 --> 00:29:11.320]   Solomon is the next king that we're going to be looking at.
[00:29:11.320 --> 00:29:14.040]   Okay?
[00:29:14.040 --> 00:29:15.560]   I couldn't think of a clever thing.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.560]   So just think of Temple City Proverbs teacher.
[00:29:17.560 --> 00:29:21.040]   I teach the Proverbs on Sunday morning to BAM people, okay?
[00:29:21.040 --> 00:29:23.680]   And I went to Temple City High School, okay?
[00:29:23.680 --> 00:29:27.960]   So that's me, all right?
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:33.400]   So think Temple City Proverbs teacher, and the reason I put Proverbs in there, I was
[00:29:33.400 --> 00:29:38.600]   thinking of how to figure out like Peter, Temple City Peter Thung.
[00:29:38.600 --> 00:29:41.320]   So I couldn't figure it out, but then I was like, okay, Proverbs will help.
[00:29:41.320 --> 00:29:42.560]   Because who wrote the Proverbs?
[00:29:42.560 --> 00:29:44.520]   Most of the Proverbs, what king?
[00:29:44.520 --> 00:29:45.520]   Solomon.
[00:29:45.520 --> 00:29:50.680]   So think Temple City Proverbs teacher, and you can remember Solomon.
[00:29:50.680 --> 00:29:53.320]   And I will be further etched into your memory for the rest of your life.
[00:29:53.320 --> 00:29:55.080]   Good luck with that, okay?
[00:29:55.080 --> 00:29:59.480]   The first thing Solomon should be noted for is he was the one who built the temple of
[00:29:59.480 --> 00:30:08.080]   God.
[00:30:08.080 --> 00:30:12.720]   The original one, the main one, okay?
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:16.520]   King Solomon's temple.
[00:30:16.520 --> 00:30:19.400]   He brought in all kinds of culture.
[00:30:19.400 --> 00:30:25.480]   He had all kinds of literature, all kinds of foods, because guess what other cultures
[00:30:25.480 --> 00:30:27.480]   brought to him?
[00:30:27.480 --> 00:30:29.520]   Fruits, okay?
[00:30:29.520 --> 00:30:32.320]   And like literature, education.
[00:30:32.320 --> 00:30:40.760]   So it actually says in 1 Kings, he knew everything about like fish, birds, animals, flowers,
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:41.760]   plants.
[00:30:41.760 --> 00:30:44.960]   This man was literally a know-it-all, okay?
[00:30:44.960 --> 00:30:48.280]   And he was brought, there were things brought to him.
[00:30:48.280 --> 00:30:50.080]   I'm assuming he even had a zoo.
[00:30:50.080 --> 00:30:55.820]   I mean, he has 12,000 horses, but I'm assuming he even has a zoo, okay?
[00:30:55.820 --> 00:30:59.360]   Because you get rare exotic animals, you start collecting them, all right?
[00:30:59.360 --> 00:31:03.680]   So Solomon, he built a temple, he had culture, the TC.
[00:31:03.680 --> 00:31:05.720]   What's TC stand for?
[00:31:05.720 --> 00:31:07.160]   What city does it stand for?
[00:31:07.160 --> 00:31:11.520]   Temple City, that's where my high school was.
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.720]   He is the only king where there was zero war.
[00:31:15.720 --> 00:31:17.800]   Who took care of all the war?
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:18.800]   His daddy.
[00:31:18.800 --> 00:31:22.240]   His daddy basically wiped out all enemies, so Solomon's living large.
[00:31:22.240 --> 00:31:23.800]   Okay, how many years?
[00:31:23.800 --> 00:31:25.040]   40 years.
[00:31:25.040 --> 00:31:28.760]   So he had peace.
[00:31:28.760 --> 00:31:29.760]   But guess what?
[00:31:29.760 --> 00:31:36.400]   All of his sons were doofuses, because when they're in like a time of peace, they're not
[00:31:36.400 --> 00:31:39.380]   really like trained through hardship.
[00:31:39.380 --> 00:31:43.920]   So his sons, so Solomon was a wise man, but a bad father, okay?
[00:31:43.920 --> 00:31:44.920]   So there was peace.
[00:31:44.920 --> 00:31:48.060]   There was 40 years of peace.
[00:31:48.060 --> 00:31:53.560]   And for the first time in human history, there's an organized taxation system.
[00:31:53.560 --> 00:31:54.560]   Boo.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   Okay?
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:31:57.000]   But Solomon's responsible for this.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:58.160]   He has 12 tribes.
[00:31:58.160 --> 00:32:00.160]   Who united them?
[00:32:00.160 --> 00:32:01.840]   His daddy, okay?
[00:32:01.840 --> 00:32:07.560]   But now all of these 12 tribes who are loyal to daddy have all kinds of goods and resources
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:09.360]   and money.
[00:32:09.360 --> 00:32:17.520]   As a unified country, we should start collecting little bits from everybody so that we can
[00:32:17.520 --> 00:32:21.160]   be used to protect and take care of them.
[00:32:21.160 --> 00:32:24.720]   Solomon in his wisdom started an organized government.
[00:32:24.720 --> 00:32:25.720]   You guys follow me?
[00:32:25.720 --> 00:32:27.520]   But who set that all up?
[00:32:27.520 --> 00:32:34.080]   David, his dad, because he united the 12 tribes, established where?
[00:32:34.080 --> 00:32:38.680]   Jerusalem as a center of worship, and he assembled massive armies.
[00:32:38.680 --> 00:32:39.680]   They all fought.
[00:32:39.680 --> 00:32:40.680]   One guy had a spear.
[00:32:40.680 --> 00:32:42.600]   He killed 800 people by himself.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:44.760]   So Solomon had 40 years of peace.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:49.420]   So he had the ability to build a temple undistracted.
[00:32:49.420 --> 00:32:53.200]   He had the ability to just have time to study cultures.
[00:32:53.200 --> 00:32:57.200]   And he had the know-it-all or the know-how to just collect taxes.
[00:32:57.200 --> 00:32:58.200]   So far so good?
[00:32:58.200 --> 00:33:00.760]   We're going to do a little review, okay?
[00:33:00.760 --> 00:33:08.200]   Oh, before we do that, this is Rehoboam versus Jeroboam, the first kings of both north and
[00:33:08.200 --> 00:33:09.200]   south.
[00:33:09.200 --> 00:33:11.680]   They have a conversation.
[00:33:11.680 --> 00:33:16.320]   And Jeroboam, who used to be Solomon's servant, says this.
[00:33:16.320 --> 00:33:19.880]   Your father made our yoke hard.
[00:33:19.880 --> 00:33:24.260]   Now therefore, lighten the hard service of your father and his heavy yoke, which he put
[00:33:24.260 --> 00:33:25.260]   on us.
[00:33:25.260 --> 00:33:26.260]   And what is a heavy yoke?
[00:33:26.260 --> 00:33:27.260]   All the taxes.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:30.140]   So Solomon taxes people heavily.
[00:33:30.140 --> 00:33:31.600]   And we will serve you.
[00:33:31.600 --> 00:33:38.620]   But Rehoboam, instead of trusting his father's advisors, he trusts his buddies, his posse.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.800]   And they go, you need to establish yourself as a stronger king.
[00:33:42.800 --> 00:33:46.760]   If Solomon made a heavy yoke, you make yours heavier.
[00:33:46.760 --> 00:33:50.060]   And he did that in that class of war.
[00:33:50.060 --> 00:33:52.780]   So there's all kinds of people drama.
[00:33:52.780 --> 00:33:53.780]   Here we go.
[00:33:53.780 --> 00:33:54.780]   Let's review.
[00:33:54.780 --> 00:33:58.320]   So find a partner and review these things together.
[00:33:58.320 --> 00:34:02.860]   The blacks, what we covered before, the red ones are the ones we just covered in the last
[00:34:02.860 --> 00:34:04.160]   few minutes.
[00:34:04.160 --> 00:34:08.280]   So review with your partner for about three, four minutes.
[00:34:08.280 --> 00:34:15.280]   Find a partner and then go ahead and take some time.
