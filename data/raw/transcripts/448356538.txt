[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:21.240]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles to Hebrews chapter 10.
[00:00:21.240 --> 00:00:24.940]   We're going to be looking at verse 1 through 18, but I'm not going to read the whole thing
[00:00:24.940 --> 00:00:26.560]   because it's a little bit lengthy.
[00:00:26.560 --> 00:00:30.200]   I'm just going to read the first seven verses before we jump in.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:33.240]   Hebrews chapter 10 verse 1 through 7.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:38.720]   Again I strongly encourage you, the text that we're going to be looking at each week is
[00:00:38.720 --> 00:00:41.500]   going to be posted up on Saturday.
[00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:46.000]   You can kind of guess what text I'm going to be on even before I put it on, but if you
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.040]   just want to be sure, I highly encourage you to do that before you come on Sunday.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:53.440]   It'll help you to be able to follow along the text.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.760]   Okay, starting from verse 1, "For the law, since it has only a shadow of the good things
[00:00:57.760 --> 00:01:02.960]   to come and not the very form of things, can never by the same sacrifice which they offer
[00:01:02.960 --> 00:01:06.800]   continually year by year make perfect those who draw near.
[00:01:06.800 --> 00:01:11.160]   Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered because the worshippers, having once
[00:01:11.160 --> 00:01:14.920]   been cleansed, would no longer have had consciousness of sins.
[00:01:14.920 --> 00:01:19.440]   But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year, for it is impossible
[00:01:19.440 --> 00:01:22.120]   for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins.
[00:01:22.120 --> 00:01:26.800]   Therefore, when he comes into the world, he says, 'Sacrifice and offerings you have not
[00:01:26.800 --> 00:01:30.080]   desired, but a body you have prepared for me.
[00:01:30.080 --> 00:01:34.640]   In whole burnt offerings and sacrifices for sin you have taken no pleasure.'
[00:01:34.640 --> 00:01:39.440]   Then I said, 'Behold, I have come in the scroll of the book it is written of me to do your
[00:01:39.440 --> 00:01:40.440]   will, O God.'"
[00:01:40.440 --> 00:01:41.440]   Let's pray.
[00:01:41.440 --> 00:01:45.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for your blessing.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.520]   We thank you for the good things that you've given us, things that we are aware of, things
[00:01:49.520 --> 00:01:53.640]   that you are doing behind the scenes that we are not aware of.
[00:01:53.640 --> 00:01:56.780]   Help us, Lord, to open our eyes to see your glory.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:01:59.840]   May your word shine greater light to who you are.
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.320]   We thank you and we love you.
[00:02:01.320 --> 00:02:05.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:10.120]   You know, despite the pandemic and things being shut down, you know, there's a lot of
[00:02:10.120 --> 00:02:13.400]   people who are getting married, especially at our church.
[00:02:13.400 --> 00:02:18.160]   You know, I think every year there's probably at least 10 to maybe even 17 weddings that
[00:02:18.160 --> 00:02:19.160]   are going on.
[00:02:19.160 --> 00:02:23.720]   And I know there's actually quite a few couples right now preparing and trying to figure out
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:27.000]   how to get this done in the pandemic.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:32.440]   And you know, I think all the pastors are engaged in some sort of marriage counseling,
[00:02:32.440 --> 00:02:35.920]   you know, as this is going on and trying to figure out how to do all of these things.
[00:02:35.920 --> 00:02:41.040]   But I think one of the key things, at least for me, when I meet with the young couples
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:42.920]   is about communication.
[00:02:42.920 --> 00:02:49.000]   I've learned throughout the years talking to various couples that one of the major conflicts
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:51.480]   in marriage is usually communication.
[00:02:51.480 --> 00:02:57.040]   And often people fight about how they're fighting rather than what they're fighting about.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:01.820]   You know, like how they said something or how they reacted to how somebody said something.
[00:03:01.820 --> 00:03:05.480]   And so much of it is because we have a difficult time communicating and understanding each
[00:03:05.480 --> 00:03:06.480]   other, right?
[00:03:06.480 --> 00:03:08.920]   Some of you are like me.
[00:03:08.920 --> 00:03:10.320]   I tend to be more direct.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:12.920]   If I have something to say, I'll just say it.
[00:03:12.920 --> 00:03:16.300]   You know, I'll say it and then you don't need to read between the lines.
[00:03:16.300 --> 00:03:18.160]   There's nothing in between the lines.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:19.480]   If I'm upset, I'll tell you I'm upset.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:20.920]   If I'm sad, I'll tell you I'm sad.
[00:03:20.920 --> 00:03:25.400]   Like I'm not going to leave it out there and kind of hopefully you guess, right?
[00:03:25.400 --> 00:03:27.080]   But some of you don't communicate like that.
[00:03:27.080 --> 00:03:28.440]   Some of you, yes means yes.
[00:03:28.440 --> 00:03:32.600]   It could mean maybe, maybe no, you know, and it's kind of thrown out there and you kind
[00:03:32.600 --> 00:03:39.960]   of communication is not as direct because you tend to be more soft, compassionate, just
[00:03:39.960 --> 00:03:43.120]   a better person, you know.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:46.840]   But whatever the case is, the way we communicate is different.
[00:03:46.840 --> 00:03:51.640]   And so we kind of have to figure out how, what they mean by this and how they mean by
[00:03:51.640 --> 00:03:52.640]   that.
[00:03:52.640 --> 00:03:57.520]   And, and I think there is a benefit in both ways to communicate, right?
[00:03:57.520 --> 00:04:04.320]   When we think about the Old Testament, the Bible says that God spoke in shadows.
[00:04:04.320 --> 00:04:08.600]   The tabernacle, it says in verse one, is a shadow and it's not the reality.
[00:04:08.600 --> 00:04:11.160]   It's about the good things to come.
[00:04:11.160 --> 00:04:16.680]   If you think about what he was communicating, he was talking about his nature and the salvation
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.320]   of mankind.
[00:04:18.320 --> 00:04:20.800]   Why didn't he make it clear?
[00:04:20.800 --> 00:04:24.320]   Why didn't he just spell out, this is Jesus.
[00:04:24.320 --> 00:04:25.960]   This is atonement.
[00:04:25.960 --> 00:04:29.880]   This is pointing to the fact that your sins aren't going to be forgiven until he comes.
[00:04:29.880 --> 00:04:31.000]   He's going to come on this day.
[00:04:31.000 --> 00:04:32.680]   He's going to do this, this, and this.
[00:04:32.680 --> 00:04:38.840]   The shadow basically causes us to look at that and, and do some work to figure out what
[00:04:38.840 --> 00:04:40.400]   is, what does this mean?
[00:04:40.400 --> 00:04:41.400]   Right?
[00:04:41.400 --> 00:04:43.020]   Because it wasn't the reality.
[00:04:43.020 --> 00:04:48.320]   So the question that we ask is, why did he communicate that way?
[00:04:48.320 --> 00:04:52.160]   I think in different cultures, just like I said, some, you know, I'm a type of person
[00:04:52.160 --> 00:04:54.000]   that needs, that is tends to be direct.
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   And then there's other people who kind of beat around the bush and cause they don't
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:04:58.000]   want to hurt your feelings.
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:01.640]   And they'll say certain things, hoping that you'll get it, you know?
[00:05:01.640 --> 00:05:03.340]   And it's like that in cultures too.
[00:05:03.340 --> 00:05:09.000]   And I realized that the Western culture gravitates toward the New Testament because New Testament
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   is direct.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:15.400]   It'll tell you, I'm Apostle Paul, you know, a bond servant of Jesus Christ.
[00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:18.120]   And I'm writing to you because these are my concerns.
[00:05:18.120 --> 00:05:20.360]   And these are five things that I want you to think about.
[00:05:20.360 --> 00:05:21.360]   And here's my conclusion.
[00:05:21.360 --> 00:05:22.360]   Goodbye.
[00:05:22.360 --> 00:05:23.360]   Right?
[00:05:23.360 --> 00:05:25.000]   And that's how the epistles are written.
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.480]   You come to the Old Testament and you have some sacrifices, you have some incest, you
[00:05:29.480 --> 00:05:35.160]   have some idol worship, and then the end, you have some revivals and then the end.
[00:05:35.160 --> 00:05:37.120]   And it's not crystal clear.
[00:05:37.120 --> 00:05:42.240]   And you kind of have to work to figure out what is the point here, right?
[00:05:42.240 --> 00:05:45.280]   Years ago, I was at a pastor's conference together for the gospel.
[00:05:45.280 --> 00:05:48.140]   And there's probably over 3,000 pastors there.
[00:05:48.140 --> 00:05:53.000]   And I remember one of the keynote speakers asked us, how many of you pastors are preaching
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:55.100]   through the Old Testament?
[00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.000]   And so out of 3,000, only about 10 of us stood up.
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:00.760]   And I just happened to be one of those people who were standing.
[00:06:00.760 --> 00:06:04.200]   And I was very filled with pride.
[00:06:04.200 --> 00:06:05.200]   That's right.
[00:06:05.200 --> 00:06:06.200]   Right?
[00:06:06.200 --> 00:06:07.200]   Right?
[00:06:07.200 --> 00:06:12.280]   But I was surprised that out of that many people, only a handful of us are preaching
[00:06:12.280 --> 00:06:13.280]   through the Old Testament.
[00:06:13.280 --> 00:06:17.080]   So obviously, his encouragement was, we need to get to the Old Testament.
[00:06:17.080 --> 00:06:20.520]   And the reason why we need to get to the Old Testament is because Old Testament prepares
[00:06:20.520 --> 00:06:22.920]   us for the New Testament.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.400]   And just like anything else, because we live in a culture where we gravitate toward clear
[00:06:28.400 --> 00:06:34.900]   communication, we think that if it's not clear, we're just kind of like, OK, let the theologians
[00:06:34.900 --> 00:06:37.280]   and the seminary people, like, let them deal with it.
[00:06:37.280 --> 00:06:41.960]   And so most people on the Western side where you and I live are pretty vague about the
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:43.120]   Old Testament.
[00:06:43.120 --> 00:06:47.960]   We kind of, we know the big stories about, you know, Noah, and we know about the flood,
[00:06:47.960 --> 00:06:51.080]   and we know about Abraham and Moses and the 10 plagues.
[00:06:51.080 --> 00:06:57.040]   But as soon as you go beyond that, that Sunday school lessons, very few people understand
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.600]   what's going on in the Old Testament.
[00:06:59.600 --> 00:07:05.320]   But there's a reason why two thirds of the Bible are written in this format.
[00:07:05.320 --> 00:07:07.680]   It was to prepare for the coming of Christ.
[00:07:07.680 --> 00:07:14.660]   So what I want to look at today, this morning in Hebrews chapter 10, when he says, all these
[00:07:14.660 --> 00:07:17.380]   things were given as a shadow of the good things to come.
[00:07:17.380 --> 00:07:19.600]   Why did he communicate this way?
[00:07:19.600 --> 00:07:21.840]   What is the purpose of the shadow?
[00:07:21.840 --> 00:07:27.180]   Why did he establish and put so much teaching of the tabernacle?
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:29.100]   And how does that affect us as Christians?
[00:07:29.100 --> 00:07:32.140]   Okay, so there's three things we want to look at in chapter 10.
[00:07:32.140 --> 00:07:37.960]   Number one, God used a shadow to cause us to long for the reality.
[00:07:37.960 --> 00:07:40.580]   God used a shadow.
[00:07:40.580 --> 00:07:44.660]   We're talking about the tabernacle system and pretty much the old covenant.
[00:07:44.660 --> 00:07:47.860]   He communicated through the shadow to cause us to long for the reality.
[00:07:47.860 --> 00:07:52.540]   In Hebrews chapter 10 verse one, it says, or the law, since it has only a shadow of
[00:07:52.540 --> 00:07:55.900]   the good things to come, and not the very form of the things.
[00:07:55.900 --> 00:08:01.620]   In other words, if you're sitting somewhere and you see a big shadow, right, that's coming,
[00:08:01.620 --> 00:08:04.180]   the first thing you want to do is to do what?
[00:08:04.180 --> 00:08:08.320]   To look who is casting the shadow, right?
[00:08:08.320 --> 00:08:10.300]   Who is casting the shadow?
[00:08:10.300 --> 00:08:15.900]   So he said that the tabernacle was established as a shadow pointing to the reality that is
[00:08:15.900 --> 00:08:17.460]   to come.
[00:08:17.460 --> 00:08:23.100]   In fact, the word gospel in the New Testament is called a mystery.
[00:08:23.100 --> 00:08:25.900]   The Greek word for that is musterion.
[00:08:25.900 --> 00:08:29.860]   And the word musterion literally means this, and this is straight out of the Bible dictionary.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:37.100]   Musterion is that which is known to the muestes, the initiated, okay?
[00:08:37.100 --> 00:08:39.700]   Which probably means nothing to you, right?
[00:08:39.700 --> 00:08:46.940]   But basically what it means is the gospel, the mystery means revelation to those who
[00:08:46.940 --> 00:08:49.060]   are seeking.
[00:08:49.060 --> 00:08:50.580]   Okay?
[00:08:50.580 --> 00:08:54.900]   That's basically what the gospel means, mystery.
[00:08:54.900 --> 00:09:01.020]   It is information that is given to those who are seeking.
[00:09:01.020 --> 00:09:03.740]   And that's exactly what Jesus says.
[00:09:03.740 --> 00:09:10.180]   When we look at the Beatitudes, and one of the Beatitudes is, "Blessed are those who
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:16.900]   hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."
[00:09:16.900 --> 00:09:20.900]   Those who are hungering and thirsting shall be satisfied.
[00:09:20.900 --> 00:09:26.500]   Not those who are just religiously going through the motion, but those who are actively seeking.
[00:09:26.500 --> 00:09:33.800]   So the first thing that he says is the purpose of the shadow is to cause in us a hungering
[00:09:33.800 --> 00:09:36.700]   for the reality.
[00:09:36.700 --> 00:09:40.460]   It's to cause us to come seek him out.
[00:09:40.460 --> 00:09:42.820]   Let me give you an example of that, okay?
[00:09:42.820 --> 00:09:46.060]   You know, sometimes I've been to a wedding, I've been to weddings where the appetizer
[00:09:46.060 --> 00:09:48.820]   is so good, right?
[00:09:48.820 --> 00:09:51.580]   It makes you anticipate the main course.
[00:09:51.580 --> 00:09:55.300]   You're out there and man, this shrimp is awesome.
[00:09:55.300 --> 00:09:58.180]   And then the next thing comes out, it's like, "Oh my gosh, that was better than the other
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.180]   one."
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:03.020]   And then the next thing comes out, it's like, "Oh my gosh, this is so good."
[00:10:03.020 --> 00:10:07.900]   And you, as you eat the appetizer, you can't help but thinking like, "If the appetizer
[00:10:07.900 --> 00:10:13.180]   is this good, I wonder how good the main course is going to be."
[00:10:13.180 --> 00:10:15.060]   Because that's the purpose of the appetizer.
[00:10:15.060 --> 00:10:19.540]   Appetizer is not meant to fill you up, it's to prepare you, get your, you know, get your
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:24.180]   taste buds ready, get your stomach juices flowing, and to anticipate.
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:28.100]   Now if you get full with the appetite, you don't have any room for that, but that was
[00:10:28.100 --> 00:10:29.540]   the purpose of the appetizer.
[00:10:29.540 --> 00:10:31.740]   Now obviously, that's just an illustration.
[00:10:31.740 --> 00:10:36.040]   I've been to weddings where the appetizer was better than the main meal, right?
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:42.680]   But the purpose of the appetizer is to prepare you and to long for what is coming.
[00:10:42.680 --> 00:10:48.600]   So the shadow is kind of an appetizer to prepare us for the reality that was going to be found
[00:10:48.600 --> 00:10:49.600]   in Christ.
[00:10:49.600 --> 00:10:52.880]   That was the whole purpose of the shadow.
[00:10:52.880 --> 00:10:56.940]   That's why it says in Matthew 7, 7 through 8, "Ask and it will be given to you, seek
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:10:59.880]   and you will find, knock and it will be opened to you.
[00:10:59.880 --> 00:11:02.480]   For everyone who asks, receives.
[00:11:02.480 --> 00:11:08.400]   He who seeks finds, and to him who knocks, it will be opened."
[00:11:08.400 --> 00:11:16.120]   You know, as a pastor, one of the things that I really like enjoy engaging in is people
[00:11:16.120 --> 00:11:18.600]   asking questions, right?
[00:11:18.600 --> 00:11:22.220]   Now there's a difference between asking questions and questioning.
[00:11:22.220 --> 00:11:24.440]   There's a huge difference.
[00:11:24.440 --> 00:11:27.840]   Sometimes people question because it's like, "I don't agree with you.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:29.320]   Why is that happening?
[00:11:29.320 --> 00:11:30.320]   Why is this?"
[00:11:30.320 --> 00:11:31.640]   So they're not looking for answers.
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:34.740]   They're just challenging, right?
[00:11:34.740 --> 00:11:39.000]   But there are times when people will ask, genuinely ask questions because they want
[00:11:39.000 --> 00:11:40.000]   to know.
[00:11:40.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   "Oh, I'm curious.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:42.000]   I heard this.
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   I don't get this.
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:44.000]   I want to know."
[00:11:44.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   And I enjoy engaging like that.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:47.560]   People will say, "Oh, I don't want to bother you because you're so busy."
[00:11:47.560 --> 00:11:50.200]   But that's why I became a pastor.
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:58.760]   So when people are genuinely seeking, right, it's great to be able to engage and participate
[00:11:58.760 --> 00:12:01.640]   in that type of interaction.
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:05.040]   You may ask, "Why does God even make us ask?
[00:12:05.040 --> 00:12:07.100]   Why doesn't He just tell us?
[00:12:07.100 --> 00:12:09.220]   Why does He make us seek?
[00:12:09.220 --> 00:12:11.280]   Why doesn't He just show up?
[00:12:11.280 --> 00:12:13.480]   Why does He ask us to knock?
[00:12:13.480 --> 00:12:16.280]   Why doesn't He just keep the door open?"
[00:12:16.280 --> 00:12:21.560]   See the whole point of what He's doing is He provided everything that we need for our
[00:12:21.560 --> 00:12:22.560]   salvation.
[00:12:22.560 --> 00:12:23.560]   He gave His only begotten Son.
[00:12:23.560 --> 00:12:29.160]   But the only criteria, the only thing that He was asking of us is to seek Him.
[00:12:29.160 --> 00:12:31.480]   He wasn't just standing out and saying, "Well, if you show up to church, I'm just going to
[00:12:31.480 --> 00:12:33.160]   pass it out.
[00:12:33.160 --> 00:12:36.440]   If you show up to church and you're just raising a Christian home, I'm just going to pass it
[00:12:36.440 --> 00:12:37.440]   out."
[00:12:37.440 --> 00:12:39.600]   He says, "No."
[00:12:39.600 --> 00:12:43.280]   All He's asked us to do is make up our mind.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:47.800]   Are you going to follow Christ or are you just going to go through the motion?
[00:12:47.800 --> 00:12:53.200]   So the whole purpose of the tabernacle is to instill in us a hungering and thirsting
[00:12:53.200 --> 00:12:57.360]   for righteousness so that when we see the shadow, we would continue to ask the question,
[00:12:57.360 --> 00:12:59.280]   "What is the reality?"
[00:12:59.280 --> 00:13:05.280]   If the shadow is this good, what must the reality be like?
[00:13:05.280 --> 00:13:08.000]   It's to build anticipation.
[00:13:08.000 --> 00:13:12.480]   You know, in 1 Corinthians 13, 9 it says, "For we know in part and we prophesy in part,
[00:13:12.480 --> 00:13:16.640]   but when the perfect comes, the partial will be done away with."
[00:13:16.640 --> 00:13:22.800]   Even now, the whole purpose of the Old Testament was to stir them up for the coming of Christ.
[00:13:22.800 --> 00:13:28.360]   Now that Christ has come and He departed, part of the purpose of our gathering is to
[00:13:28.360 --> 00:13:32.700]   stir us up for anticipation for His second coming.
[00:13:32.700 --> 00:13:40.160]   So in order for us to anticipate that our hope is not here, but ultimately over there.
[00:13:40.160 --> 00:13:46.820]   That's why He says in 1 Corinthians 13, 12, "For now we see in a mirror dimly, but then
[00:13:46.820 --> 00:13:51.320]   face to face, now I know in part, but then I will know fully, just as I also have been
[00:13:51.320 --> 00:13:54.280]   fully known."
[00:13:54.280 --> 00:14:01.320]   You and I are gathered together here, and I know it's hot, and it may be uncomfortable,
[00:14:01.320 --> 00:14:07.200]   but you're not here because you miss my face, most of you.
[00:14:07.200 --> 00:14:13.840]   You're not here because I'm so riveting that you're hanging on every single word.
[00:14:13.840 --> 00:14:14.840]   I know myself.
[00:14:14.840 --> 00:14:19.920]   Every once in a while, I'll hear my own sermon, and I can't stand my own voice.
[00:14:19.920 --> 00:14:23.600]   And sometimes I wonder, how do you do it?
[00:14:23.600 --> 00:14:27.040]   Only reason why you and I are gathered together is because we've tasted the goodness of God.
[00:14:27.040 --> 00:14:32.240]   I just happen to be a mouthpiece in which I'm pointing you to Christ, but I don't have,
[00:14:32.240 --> 00:14:37.000]   I'm not gifted enough, talented enough, articulated enough to gather your attention in this hot
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:39.860]   sun for even a week.
[00:14:39.860 --> 00:14:42.500]   If it was for me, you wouldn't be here.
[00:14:42.500 --> 00:14:47.260]   You and I are here because we've tasted the goodness of God, and we want more.
[00:14:47.260 --> 00:14:50.320]   But he said, "No matter what it is that you have experienced with God," he said, "it is
[00:14:50.320 --> 00:14:53.040]   like a child seeing through a mirror.
[00:14:53.040 --> 00:14:54.120]   It's dim."
[00:14:54.120 --> 00:14:56.220]   And all of this is to build anticipation.
[00:14:56.220 --> 00:15:01.640]   If Jesus that I met, even the little bit that I've tasted, is this good, what is it going
[00:15:01.640 --> 00:15:04.380]   to be like when we get to heaven?
[00:15:04.380 --> 00:15:09.240]   The shadow was given to us to point to the reality, to cause us to hunger for the reality
[00:15:09.240 --> 00:15:10.600]   in Christ.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:15.720]   You know, one of the questions that we commonly get is, "If you go to heaven, what will you
[00:15:15.720 --> 00:15:18.240]   say to Jesus?"
[00:15:18.240 --> 00:15:19.440]   What kind of questions will you ask?
[00:15:19.440 --> 00:15:24.240]   And I remember, I think it was last week when we were having the family feud that the Wongs
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:28.440]   put together, and one of the questions that was asked is, "What's a question that you
[00:15:28.440 --> 00:15:33.240]   would ask Jesus if you went to heaven?"
[00:15:33.240 --> 00:15:36.480]   And I think about that question a lot.
[00:15:36.480 --> 00:15:39.760]   Not what am I going to ask, like how am I going to react?
[00:15:39.760 --> 00:15:44.400]   I remember when I was younger, when I first became a Christian, because I was young, in
[00:15:44.400 --> 00:15:47.680]   my teenage years, I was thinking, "Oh, when I meet Jesus, I'm going to hold his hands,
[00:15:47.680 --> 00:15:49.040]   I'm going to hug him."
[00:15:49.040 --> 00:15:54.000]   You know, even though I wasn't a baby at that time, because I see him as a father figure.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:59.400]   Now that I'm in my 50s, that doesn't seem appropriate.
[00:15:59.400 --> 00:16:03.200]   How am I going to react when I see Jesus?
[00:16:03.200 --> 00:16:05.440]   And I can't think of anything that I would say.
[00:16:05.440 --> 00:16:07.040]   And I have some questions.
[00:16:07.040 --> 00:16:10.440]   And my first question is, "What happened to Andrew?
[00:16:10.440 --> 00:16:14.320]   Why did he invite everybody and then not a part of the inner three?"
[00:16:14.320 --> 00:16:17.880]   And I want to know the human drama that happened with Andrew.
[00:16:17.880 --> 00:16:19.800]   And I have a lot of questions.
[00:16:19.800 --> 00:16:26.360]   Pastor Peter Chung said that his question is, "Did Adam and Eve have a belly button?"
[00:16:26.360 --> 00:16:31.520]   You may all have different questions, but I think when we finally meet Christ, we're
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:32.520]   going to be speechless.
[00:16:32.520 --> 00:16:33.520]   That's what I think.
[00:16:33.520 --> 00:16:36.440]   I think we're going to be speechless.
[00:16:36.440 --> 00:16:38.740]   We're not going to have words.
[00:16:38.740 --> 00:16:45.460]   If this small glimpse that we've tasted of the goodness of God is only dimly, is only
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:51.300]   a shadow, what is the reality going to be when we actually face to face with him?
[00:16:51.300 --> 00:16:56.060]   See, that's what the shadow was for, is to build anticipation so that we would long for
[00:16:56.060 --> 00:16:59.340]   his second coming, that we would not make this place our home.
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:03.460]   That no matter how tempting and no matter how great it may seem temporarily, in light
[00:17:03.460 --> 00:17:08.900]   of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ, that all of this becomes rubbish.
[00:17:08.900 --> 00:17:11.100]   And that was the purpose of the shadow.
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:16.820]   The second purpose of the shadow is to cause us to long for true forgiveness.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:17.820]   True forgiveness.
[00:17:17.820 --> 00:17:23.700]   Hebrews chapter 10, 1-4, "By the same sacrifices which they offer continually year by year,
[00:17:23.700 --> 00:17:25.900]   make perfect those who draw near.
[00:17:25.900 --> 00:17:29.820]   Otherwise, would they not have ceased to be offered, because the worshippers, having once
[00:17:29.820 --> 00:17:33.060]   been cleansed, would no longer have the consciousness of sins."
[00:17:33.060 --> 00:17:38.900]   In other words, their repeated need for sacrifices pointed to the fact that their sin was constantly
[00:17:38.900 --> 00:17:39.900]   with them.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:44.140]   If the sacrifices that they made took away their sins, they wouldn't have to have to
[00:17:44.140 --> 00:17:45.140]   do it anymore.
[00:17:45.140 --> 00:17:50.740]   You see, the fact that they needed to do it over and over again was to teach him that
[00:17:50.740 --> 00:17:52.940]   they needed true forgiveness.
[00:17:52.940 --> 00:17:58.580]   Verse 3, "But in those sacrifices there is a reminder of sins year by year, for it is
[00:17:58.580 --> 00:18:03.620]   impossible for the blood of bulls and goats to take away sins."
[00:18:03.620 --> 00:18:08.540]   The purpose of these sacrifices was not to take away sins, but to remind them of their
[00:18:08.540 --> 00:18:09.540]   sins.
[00:18:09.540 --> 00:18:11.300]   Did you catch that?
[00:18:11.300 --> 00:18:12.820]   You see the difference between the two?
[00:18:12.820 --> 00:18:17.580]   When you make the sacrifices, you think, "Well, now I'm holy, now I'm clean, now I have direct
[00:18:17.580 --> 00:18:19.460]   access to God."
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:24.120]   But the author here is saying the purpose of these sacrifices and why it was done repeatedly
[00:18:24.120 --> 00:18:31.340]   over and over again is to remind them that no matter how much sacrifices you made, your
[00:18:31.340 --> 00:18:33.540]   sins still remain.
[00:18:33.540 --> 00:18:36.820]   You have to do it again and again and again.
[00:18:36.820 --> 00:18:42.100]   Even the drama of the Day of Atonement, of all the sacrifices that they made, they would
[00:18:42.100 --> 00:18:46.840]   put their hands symbolizing the sins of Israel going out to the wilderness and the scapegoat
[00:18:46.840 --> 00:18:49.180]   being sacrificed for their sins.
[00:18:49.180 --> 00:18:54.100]   They would go through all of that drama and then next year they'd have to do it again.
[00:18:54.100 --> 00:18:59.820]   He says all of that to remind them that those sacrifices had no power to actually forgive
[00:18:59.820 --> 00:19:00.820]   them.
[00:19:00.820 --> 00:19:04.540]   It's to remind them that the sins will still remain.
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:09.380]   You know, I think the best way to understand the shadow, the tabernacle, is kind of like
[00:19:09.380 --> 00:19:11.500]   the way we take Tylenol.
[00:19:11.500 --> 00:19:17.540]   You know, I've met some people who refuse to take Tylenol.
[00:19:17.540 --> 00:19:20.760]   The reasoning that they give is, "Well, Tylenol doesn't fix the problem.
[00:19:20.760 --> 00:19:23.460]   It only hides the symptom."
[00:19:23.460 --> 00:19:27.220]   You get a bad headache and you say, "You know, I'm not going to take Tylenol because it harms
[00:19:27.220 --> 00:19:31.020]   my body and it's not going to fix the problem."
[00:19:31.020 --> 00:19:33.660]   Maybe you got a headache because of dehydration.
[00:19:33.660 --> 00:19:38.900]   And so you take the pill to get rid of the headache, but it has nothing to do with dehydration.
[00:19:38.900 --> 00:19:44.540]   So Tylenol can be harmful if you never deal with the problem.
[00:19:44.540 --> 00:19:47.760]   If you don't drink water, if you take Tylenol and you don't drink enough water to get rid
[00:19:47.760 --> 00:19:51.660]   of the reason behind the headache, then the Tylenol becomes a problem.
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:57.140]   So some people, and I've met some doctors who don't believe in taking Tylenol, right?
[00:19:57.140 --> 00:20:00.220]   But we take Tylenol so that we can function.
[00:20:00.220 --> 00:20:01.220]   We can function.
[00:20:01.220 --> 00:20:02.220]   It doesn't deal with the problem.
[00:20:02.220 --> 00:20:03.220]   We have to drink the water.
[00:20:03.220 --> 00:20:05.020]   We have to deal with the problem.
[00:20:05.020 --> 00:20:10.020]   But having the headache go away helps me to read, help me to study, help me to function
[00:20:10.020 --> 00:20:12.340]   without really curing the problem.
[00:20:12.340 --> 00:20:15.220]   See, that was the tabernacle.
[00:20:15.220 --> 00:20:20.980]   The tabernacle basically dealt with the sins in order to be able to have a covenant relationship
[00:20:20.980 --> 00:20:25.140]   with this God without ever taking away the root problem.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.780]   And that's what he was telling them.
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:32.740]   It took away the immediate symptom to be able to function with God, but it constantly told
[00:20:32.740 --> 00:20:37.880]   them, but the problem still remains because sacrifice has to be done again.
[00:20:37.880 --> 00:20:39.760]   When Tylenol wears off, you have to do it again.
[00:20:39.760 --> 00:20:44.100]   You have to take it again because you're still dehydrated.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.700]   He says that's the reason why he has this.
[00:20:46.700 --> 00:20:53.320]   So anybody who relies on their good deeds and religiousness, all they're doing is masking
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.580]   their sins with good works.
[00:20:56.580 --> 00:20:59.860]   And it eases their conscience for a minute.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:05.900]   But eventually the real problem is going to surface over and over and over again.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.340]   But you know what's interesting?
[00:21:07.340 --> 00:21:08.340]   Hebrews 10.17.
[00:21:08.340 --> 00:21:14.580]   Hebrews chapter 10.3 says, "All these sacrifices were the reminders of sins year by year to
[00:21:14.580 --> 00:21:18.380]   cause them to remember, 'You are in your sins.'"
[00:21:18.380 --> 00:21:22.740]   But then we get to verse 17 and he says, "And their sins and their lawless deeds, I will
[00:21:22.740 --> 00:21:25.860]   remember no more."
[00:21:25.860 --> 00:21:27.300]   Did you get that?
[00:21:27.300 --> 00:21:32.260]   The whole reason why he caused us to remember our sins is so that we may anticipate the
[00:21:32.260 --> 00:21:36.820]   only one who can actually deal with our sins.
[00:21:36.820 --> 00:21:40.300]   And he says he will remember no more.
[00:21:40.300 --> 00:21:45.220]   He's causing us to remember our sins so that we may run to the only one who can actually
[00:21:45.220 --> 00:21:47.820]   deal with the actual problem of sins.
[00:21:47.820 --> 00:21:53.100]   And when we give it to him, he says he will remember it no more.
[00:21:53.100 --> 00:21:54.540]   Isn't that incredible?
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:58.820]   He said that's why he communicated to us through the tabernacle.
[00:21:58.820 --> 00:22:00.620]   So that we may be able to understand it.
[00:22:00.620 --> 00:22:05.320]   Psalm chapter 103 verse 12, "As far as the east is from the west, so far has he removed
[00:22:05.320 --> 00:22:07.580]   our transmissions from us."
[00:22:07.580 --> 00:22:12.420]   And then in Isaiah chapter 43, 25, "I, even I am the one who wipes out the transgressions
[00:22:12.420 --> 00:22:17.460]   of my own sake, and I will not remember your sins."
[00:22:17.460 --> 00:22:18.580]   I will not remember.
[00:22:18.580 --> 00:22:23.580]   I wanted you to remember so that you will recognize that I will not remember when I
[00:22:23.580 --> 00:22:24.580]   come.
[00:22:24.580 --> 00:22:29.020]   You know, Satan has a lot of different names.
[00:22:29.020 --> 00:22:37.480]   But one of his key names that identifies how he works in our lives is an accuser.
[00:22:37.480 --> 00:22:38.520]   He's an accuser.
[00:22:38.520 --> 00:22:39.900]   The one who accuses.
[00:22:39.900 --> 00:22:41.400]   He's the prosecutor.
[00:22:41.400 --> 00:22:45.860]   So if you have anything that he can cause you to feel guilty and stray away from God,
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.440]   he said that's his duty.
[00:22:48.440 --> 00:22:53.820]   In Jeremiah chapter 50 verse 20, this is what God says about the sins of Israel.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:22:58.760]   And I want you to remember, if you've ever read through the Old Testament, it's basically
[00:22:58.760 --> 00:23:01.340]   history of Israel's sin.
[00:23:01.340 --> 00:23:08.520]   How the curse of the law was being added upon them generation after generation after generation.
[00:23:08.520 --> 00:23:14.720]   So by the time we end the Old Testament, Israel is in utter despair.
[00:23:14.720 --> 00:23:19.260]   Almost every single king in Israel led Israel to sin.
[00:23:19.260 --> 00:23:22.120]   But here was what it says, Jeremiah 50 verse 20 in the New Covenant.
[00:23:22.120 --> 00:23:28.040]   He says, "In those days and at that time, declares the Lord, search will be made for
[00:23:28.040 --> 00:23:31.320]   the iniquity of Israel, but there will be none."
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   Did you catch that?
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:39.520]   He said, they're going to try to accuse Israel for their sins.
[00:23:39.520 --> 00:23:41.880]   They're going to search for their sins, but there will be none.
[00:23:41.880 --> 00:23:47.160]   And for the sins of Judah, but they will not be able to be found, for I will pardon those
[00:23:47.160 --> 00:23:49.680]   whom I leave as a remnant.
[00:23:49.680 --> 00:23:50.960]   He said they're going to search for it.
[00:23:50.960 --> 00:23:54.640]   They're going to look to accuse Israel, but not because they are righteous, not because
[00:23:54.640 --> 00:23:57.720]   they got their act together and they're not going to sin anymore.
[00:23:57.720 --> 00:24:00.680]   It says, because I will pardon them.
[00:24:00.680 --> 00:24:06.320]   And because I will pardon them, they will look for reasons to accuse them.
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:12.400]   They will search, actively search to find reasons to disqualify them, but they will
[00:24:12.400 --> 00:24:13.400]   not find it.
[00:24:13.400 --> 00:24:17.120]   He says, because I will pardon them.
[00:24:17.120 --> 00:24:21.240]   That was the whole purpose of the shadow, is to remind us of our sins so that we would
[00:24:21.240 --> 00:24:23.240]   run to the one who will not remember.
[00:24:23.240 --> 00:24:29.760]   Third and finally, God used the shadow to cause us to long for true worship, for true
[00:24:29.760 --> 00:24:31.600]   worship.
[00:24:31.600 --> 00:24:36.800]   The text that we're looking at in verse 5 through 9 is almost verbatim a copy of Psalm
[00:24:36.800 --> 00:24:42.080]   chapter 40, verse 6 through 8, where David is crying out to God, and this is what he
[00:24:42.080 --> 00:24:44.040]   says.
[00:24:44.040 --> 00:24:48.960]   He says, sacrifice an offering you have not desired, but a body you have prepared for
[00:24:48.960 --> 00:24:49.960]   me.
[00:24:49.960 --> 00:24:53.040]   Let's just stop right there.
[00:24:53.040 --> 00:24:58.760]   Sacrifice an offering you have not desired, meaning God did not desire it, right?
[00:24:58.760 --> 00:25:03.160]   Who commanded these sacrifices?
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:04.160]   Who commanded these sacrifices?
[00:25:04.160 --> 00:25:05.160]   They're not talking about idols.
[00:25:05.160 --> 00:25:08.760]   He didn't say, worship of idols I did not desire.
[00:25:08.760 --> 00:25:10.760]   He didn't say that.
[00:25:10.760 --> 00:25:14.920]   We spent almost a year and a half studying the book of Leviticus about what God desired
[00:25:14.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   of these sacrifices.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:23.080]   And yet here in Psalm, David says, sacrifice an offering you have not desired.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:24.800]   Which is it?
[00:25:24.800 --> 00:25:27.920]   Why did you go through all of that drama, tell them to sacrifice, and then when they
[00:25:27.920 --> 00:25:30.920]   gave sacrifices, God said, I don't want it.
[00:25:30.920 --> 00:25:37.280]   And then verse 6, in whole burnt offerings and sacrifice sin, you have not taken any
[00:25:37.280 --> 00:25:39.140]   pleasure.
[00:25:39.140 --> 00:25:43.360]   Not only did he not like it when they gave it, he said he found no pleasure.
[00:25:43.360 --> 00:25:46.800]   Verse 7, then I said, behold, I have come in the scroll of the book it is written of
[00:25:46.800 --> 00:25:49.160]   me to do your will, O God.
[00:25:49.160 --> 00:25:53.160]   And after saying above, sacrifice an offering, then whole burnt offerings and sacrifice for
[00:25:53.160 --> 00:25:58.560]   sin you have not desired, nor have you taken pleasure in them, which are offered according
[00:25:58.560 --> 00:26:01.480]   to the law.
[00:26:01.480 --> 00:26:06.300]   In case anybody was thinking that the burnt offerings, they didn't follow the rules.
[00:26:06.300 --> 00:26:07.300]   And that's why.
[00:26:07.300 --> 00:26:10.640]   You know, I told you to give, you know, goat offering, you gave a lamb.
[00:26:10.640 --> 00:26:12.600]   I told you to give a bull, but you gave this.
[00:26:12.600 --> 00:26:16.080]   He said, no, he said they followed the law.
[00:26:16.080 --> 00:26:18.140]   They did what God told them to do.
[00:26:18.140 --> 00:26:22.480]   Then why is he saying he finds no pleasure in them?
[00:26:22.480 --> 00:26:25.600]   Why does he say there's no pleasure in all of that?
[00:26:25.600 --> 00:26:32.640]   In fact, one of the harshest rebuked toward the nation of Israel is written in book of
[00:26:32.640 --> 00:26:38.200]   Amos and Isaiah, and their sin was superficial worship.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:43.200]   In Amos chapter 5, 21 to 23, listen carefully to the rebuke of Israel.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:47.820]   I hate, I reject your festivals.
[00:26:47.820 --> 00:26:50.000]   Who commanded these festivals?
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:51.360]   God did.
[00:26:51.360 --> 00:26:56.320]   And yet God says, I hate, I reject your festival, nor do I delight in your solemn assemblies.
[00:26:56.320 --> 00:26:57.540]   Why were they assembling?
[00:26:57.540 --> 00:26:59.640]   Because God told them to assemble.
[00:26:59.640 --> 00:27:04.240]   Even though you offer up to me burnt offerings, God commanded the burnt offerings and your
[00:27:04.240 --> 00:27:06.880]   grain offerings, God commanded the grain offerings.
[00:27:06.880 --> 00:27:08.160]   I will not accept them.
[00:27:08.160 --> 00:27:11.840]   I will not even look at the peace offerings of your fatlings.
[00:27:11.840 --> 00:27:18.960]   Take away from me the noise of your songs, the worship songs that you are singing, the
[00:27:18.960 --> 00:27:21.080]   guitar that you are playing.
[00:27:21.080 --> 00:27:22.880]   He doesn't say, oh, you're worshiping me.
[00:27:22.880 --> 00:27:25.080]   He says, no, they are noise to me.
[00:27:25.080 --> 00:27:27.640]   I will not even listen to the sound of your harps.
[00:27:27.640 --> 00:27:29.960]   Man, that's harsh.
[00:27:29.960 --> 00:27:33.000]   And you can dissect all of this and saying, well, they're just following your instruction.
[00:27:33.000 --> 00:27:34.920]   We're assembling because you told us to assemble.
[00:27:34.920 --> 00:27:36.960]   We're singing because you told us to sing.
[00:27:36.960 --> 00:27:39.080]   We're sacrificing because you told us to sacrifice.
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.040]   Then why do you reject this?
[00:27:41.040 --> 00:27:44.520]   Again, it's in Isaiah chapter 1, 12 through 14.
[00:27:44.520 --> 00:27:50.600]   When you come to appear before me, who required of you this trampling of my courts?
[00:27:50.600 --> 00:27:54.240]   We just automatically assume because we're gathered, he must be pleased.
[00:27:54.240 --> 00:27:58.000]   I mean, at least we're sucking it up.
[00:27:58.000 --> 00:28:01.040]   I mean, this is not easy, right?
[00:28:01.040 --> 00:28:06.040]   I mean, we're pretty soft Christians here in the United States, but this is hard business,
[00:28:06.040 --> 00:28:07.040]   right?
[00:28:07.040 --> 00:28:10.760]   And so, hey, we must be godly.
[00:28:10.760 --> 00:28:14.200]   We just automatically assume if I showed up, God is worship.
[00:28:14.200 --> 00:28:19.500]   But he said, who required of you this trampling of my court?
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:24.320]   He called their corporate worship trampling.
[00:28:24.320 --> 00:28:28.760]   Bring your worthless offerings no longer.
[00:28:28.760 --> 00:28:30.400]   This is an abomination to me.
[00:28:30.400 --> 00:28:32.720]   New moon and Sabbath, the calling of the assemblies.
[00:28:32.720 --> 00:28:35.640]   I cannot endure iniquities in solemn assembly.
[00:28:35.640 --> 00:28:39.720]   I hate your new moon festivals and your appointed feast.
[00:28:39.720 --> 00:28:40.880]   They have become a burden to me.
[00:28:40.880 --> 00:28:44.680]   I am weary of bearing them.
[00:28:44.680 --> 00:28:48.480]   Every little thing that he mentions in this text are things that he commanded the nation
[00:28:48.480 --> 00:28:53.600]   of Israel, and yet he says, I hate them.
[00:28:53.600 --> 00:28:56.160]   Why?
[00:28:56.160 --> 00:29:02.560]   Because God didn't ask for sacrifices because he was a connoisseur of dead meat.
[00:29:02.560 --> 00:29:06.960]   God didn't tell them to assembles because he liked his people coming and he wants to
[00:29:06.960 --> 00:29:09.280]   hear good music.
[00:29:09.280 --> 00:29:11.920]   He didn't like the smell of barbecue.
[00:29:11.920 --> 00:29:14.880]   That was not the reason why he set this up.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:19.400]   All of this was a shadow to point to the reality that we can only find in Christ.
[00:29:19.400 --> 00:29:23.480]   And what the Jews did was they gathered together and was going through the motion and checking
[00:29:23.480 --> 00:29:27.920]   off the list and thinking that that made them righteous before God.
[00:29:27.920 --> 00:29:34.440]   And God says, your superficial worship to me is a burden.
[00:29:34.440 --> 00:29:39.620]   It does nothing other than blind us to think that we're righteous.
[00:29:39.620 --> 00:29:47.260]   Our sacrifices, our giving, our leadership, our singing, all of that in God's eyes become
[00:29:47.260 --> 00:29:54.400]   a burden because it fools us to think that we are more righteous than we really are.
[00:29:54.400 --> 00:29:59.360]   Sometimes those people who've been raised in the church in good Christian homes are
[00:29:59.360 --> 00:30:01.580]   the first ones to be blinded.
[00:30:01.580 --> 00:30:06.120]   Those who have positions in the church as leaders in the church are the first ones to
[00:30:06.120 --> 00:30:12.080]   be blinded because we automatically assume that our title, our position, our work somehow
[00:30:12.080 --> 00:30:15.560]   makes us more righteous before God.
[00:30:15.560 --> 00:30:19.640]   But what God desires more than anything else is true worship.
[00:30:19.640 --> 00:30:25.760]   What he wanted was worship, not the assembly, not the sacrifice, but worship.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:31.520]   Hosea 6, 6, for I delight in loyalty rather than sacrifice and in the knowledge of God
[00:30:31.520 --> 00:30:33.640]   rather than burnt offering.
[00:30:33.640 --> 00:30:38.640]   When was the last time you pursued God?
[00:30:38.640 --> 00:30:42.720]   We always say God pursued us, but when was the last time you were hungering and thirsting
[00:30:42.720 --> 00:30:47.840]   for God and you wanted him and you wanted to know what he had to say and you went to
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:51.200]   the scriptures because you wanted to hear from him, not because you were accountable
[00:30:51.200 --> 00:30:55.080]   to the small group that you were at, not because you're a small group leader, not because of
[00:30:55.080 --> 00:31:01.480]   the title, not because there's a test coming up, but because you wanted to know God.
[00:31:01.480 --> 00:31:03.960]   Because you wanted to worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:08.960]   He says the whole purpose of the tabernacle was to instill in us a hungering and thirsting
[00:31:08.960 --> 00:31:12.480]   that we may come to him to give him true worship.
[00:31:12.480 --> 00:31:19.360]   And that's why in Hebrews chapter 10, 15 to 16, the new covenant is described this way.
[00:31:19.360 --> 00:31:23.560]   And the Holy Spirit also testified to us for after saying, this is the covenant that I
[00:31:23.560 --> 00:31:29.240]   will make with them after those days, says the Lord, I will put my laws upon their heart
[00:31:29.240 --> 00:31:31.680]   and on their mind, I will write them.
[00:31:31.680 --> 00:31:35.440]   In other words, worship.
[00:31:35.440 --> 00:31:40.400]   What is God doing in our hearts that we express through our mouth is what God desires.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:44.040]   That's why when he encountered the Samaritan woman and say, well, you Jews worship on that
[00:31:44.040 --> 00:31:49.080]   mountain, but we say with that mountain and Jesus stops are right there.
[00:31:49.080 --> 00:31:53.920]   They worship and they may have the truth and you may think you have the spirit, but what
[00:31:53.920 --> 00:31:59.520]   God is looking for people who will worship him in spirit and in truth.
[00:31:59.520 --> 00:32:04.200]   It is not enough that you and I learned the Bible week after week.
[00:32:04.200 --> 00:32:10.920]   In fact, we can easily be fooled because the word is getting into you that that's enough.
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.040]   You know more than other Christians.
[00:32:13.040 --> 00:32:15.260]   You've studied more than other Christians.
[00:32:15.260 --> 00:32:20.080]   And all that will do is to give you false confidence that somehow you're more righteous
[00:32:20.080 --> 00:32:22.240]   than other people.
[00:32:22.240 --> 00:32:26.360]   If the spirit of God is not moving you to worship, if the word of God is not causing
[00:32:26.360 --> 00:32:30.520]   you to be broken over your sins and broken over the sins of the, of the world, and it
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:36.800]   doesn't cause us to reach out with the gospel and all it has done is added information after
[00:32:36.800 --> 00:32:39.940]   information after information.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:43.840]   What God desires is in spirit and in truth to worship him.
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.120]   And that's what the shadow was for.
[00:32:46.120 --> 00:32:51.920]   So now we come to the new covenant in Romans chapter one, chapter 12, one, didn't he say
[00:32:51.920 --> 00:32:57.880]   in view of the mercy of God to present your body as a living sacrifice.
[00:32:57.880 --> 00:33:01.480]   You know, let me, let me wrap this all up with this.
[00:33:01.480 --> 00:33:02.480]   Okay.
[00:33:02.480 --> 00:33:06.800]   In the Old Testament, all the sacrifices fall into two categories, the mandatory offering
[00:33:06.800 --> 00:33:08.280]   and the free will offering.
[00:33:08.280 --> 00:33:10.320]   The mandatory offering is required.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:14.440]   You cannot get to the presence of God unless there's a burnt offering or whole offering
[00:33:14.440 --> 00:33:16.600]   or sin offering or guilt offering.
[00:33:16.600 --> 00:33:21.160]   Those offerings had to be made in order to have a relationship with God.
[00:33:21.160 --> 00:33:22.800]   And then there was the free will offering.
[00:33:22.800 --> 00:33:26.320]   It was when God blessed you or just out of the abundance of your heart, you just wanted
[00:33:26.320 --> 00:33:27.720]   to thank God.
[00:33:27.720 --> 00:33:34.200]   And so it was not mandatory, but you voluntarily brought things to God and you worshiped.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:40.520]   In the new covenant, the mandatory offering is complete in Christ.
[00:33:40.520 --> 00:33:43.880]   So when Jesus was dying on the cross, it says it is finished.
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:48.540]   He's saying that the mandatory offering, what is mandated for us to come to God has been
[00:33:48.540 --> 00:33:49.540]   done.
[00:33:49.540 --> 00:33:51.220]   It is finished.
[00:33:51.220 --> 00:33:56.840]   So when he requires of us a living sacrifice, he's talking about a free will offering for
[00:33:56.840 --> 00:34:01.680]   us to give to him from our hearts voluntarily.
[00:34:01.680 --> 00:34:07.720]   So what we do, we volunteer to him because he's done so much for us out of thankfulness,
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:08.900]   out of act of worship.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:09.900]   We give to him.
[00:34:09.900 --> 00:34:14.520]   We come to church, not because it's mandated, because I want to express to my God what he
[00:34:14.520 --> 00:34:17.160]   has done for me.
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:23.720]   I cannot begin to understand why he puts up with sinners.
[00:34:23.720 --> 00:34:30.200]   And if there's any mystery that I just cannot figure out is why does he love us?
[00:34:30.200 --> 00:34:32.760]   I don't get it.
[00:34:32.760 --> 00:34:35.600]   I really don't get it.
[00:34:35.600 --> 00:34:41.280]   I mean, I've said this many times, but I don't have any compassion for cockroaches.
[00:34:41.280 --> 00:34:43.600]   None, zero.
[00:34:43.600 --> 00:34:47.440]   Because that's nothing to my life.
[00:34:47.440 --> 00:34:49.520]   It's a burden.
[00:34:49.520 --> 00:34:52.080]   You know, it's disgusting.
[00:34:52.080 --> 00:34:54.120]   You know, and it's not because it brings disease.
[00:34:54.120 --> 00:34:57.840]   It's just I just don't want it.
[00:34:57.840 --> 00:35:04.640]   I think about our relationship with God and how we so easily get distracted.
[00:35:04.640 --> 00:35:08.760]   How easily we complain because we didn't get what we wanted.
[00:35:08.760 --> 00:35:10.240]   How easily we just get bored.
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:11.720]   It's just bored.
[00:35:11.720 --> 00:35:18.000]   You know, everything else in this world seems so exciting, but God sometimes is bored.
[00:35:18.000 --> 00:35:21.040]   Why does he put up with this?
[00:35:21.040 --> 00:35:24.440]   I mean, just not to crush us.
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:26.520]   That in and of itself is a mystery.
[00:35:26.520 --> 00:35:28.360]   Why doesn't the earth just explode?
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:30.440]   Enough of this.
[00:35:30.440 --> 00:35:33.480]   These people burning Bibles and questioning me.
[00:35:33.480 --> 00:35:34.960]   Boom, done.
[00:35:34.960 --> 00:35:36.840]   I just create something else.
[00:35:36.840 --> 00:35:37.840]   Do it over.
[00:35:37.840 --> 00:35:42.760]   I know he promised that he would never crush us again with the flood, but he's God.
[00:35:42.760 --> 00:35:44.600]   Once we're gone, who's going to question him?
[00:35:44.600 --> 00:35:48.920]   No, you said it's like start over.
[00:35:48.920 --> 00:35:49.920]   Why not?
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.280]   I would have done it.
[00:35:52.280 --> 00:35:54.760]   You would have done it.
[00:35:54.760 --> 00:35:57.080]   I don't get it.
[00:35:57.080 --> 00:35:58.560]   I understand hell.
[00:35:58.560 --> 00:36:02.800]   I don't know about you, but I understand hell.
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.680]   Yeah, I mean, you can understand.
[00:36:05.680 --> 00:36:08.680]   I think you and I do understand hell.
[00:36:08.680 --> 00:36:12.000]   Why an almighty God would create hell.
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:14.040]   I get it.
[00:36:14.040 --> 00:36:15.120]   He's God.
[00:36:15.120 --> 00:36:17.040]   You mess with him, you get hell.
[00:36:17.040 --> 00:36:18.420]   I get that.
[00:36:18.420 --> 00:36:21.680]   I don't get heaven.
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.280]   Why does he choose to show mercy to us?
[00:36:26.280 --> 00:36:29.920]   Why does he give his only begotten son for our sins?
[00:36:29.920 --> 00:36:32.560]   And that will remain a mystery to me.
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:36.680]   And I'm not sure if I get to heaven, that is going to be answered.
[00:36:36.680 --> 00:36:39.360]   I'm not sure.
[00:36:39.360 --> 00:36:44.600]   But the glimpse of what I have seen in him, there's nothing.
[00:36:44.600 --> 00:36:47.980]   There's nothing on earth that compares.
[00:36:47.980 --> 00:36:59.240]   I pray with all my heart that as Christians living in this fallen world with all the distractions,
[00:36:59.240 --> 00:37:05.880]   with all the things that make us uncomfortable, that we would never lose the fact, lose the
[00:37:05.880 --> 00:37:10.600]   mystery of what it is that you and I sing every single Sunday.
[00:37:10.600 --> 00:37:13.360]   That it's not just empty words.
[00:37:13.360 --> 00:37:16.920]   The mystery of the cross, I cannot understand.
[00:37:16.920 --> 00:37:22.300]   I pray that that mystery would cause us to persevere, endure, to be bold in sharing the
[00:37:22.300 --> 00:37:25.600]   gospel and be the light that God called us to be.
[00:37:25.600 --> 00:37:30.400]   Let's pray.
[00:37:30.400 --> 00:37:38.920]   Father, we just want to thank you from the bottom of our hearts.
[00:37:38.920 --> 00:37:42.780]   Lord, you know my sins better than I do.
[00:37:42.780 --> 00:37:45.120]   You know our weaknesses.
[00:37:45.120 --> 00:37:49.620]   Even now, Lord God, as we come to worship you, you know the burdens that we carry.
[00:37:49.620 --> 00:37:55.000]   You know the distractions and the temptations, bitterness, Lord, we harbor in our hearts.
[00:37:55.000 --> 00:37:58.200]   The anger that we refuse to let go of.
[00:37:58.200 --> 00:38:00.080]   Forgive us.
[00:38:00.080 --> 00:38:06.640]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our eyes upon Christ, what he has done, what he has endured, the
[00:38:06.640 --> 00:38:12.000]   grace that he's given us, that we may have this life and have this life abundantly.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:17.040]   That everything that we do may be a reflection of that grace you've shown us.
[00:38:17.040 --> 00:38:22.160]   I pray, Father, that through the shadow, that you would cause us to hunger and thirst for
[00:38:22.160 --> 00:38:24.000]   the reality.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:31.640]   As we remember our sins, that we would remember, Father God, that only you can forgive us and
[00:38:31.640 --> 00:38:34.620]   cast away our sins.
[00:38:34.620 --> 00:38:39.240]   That it would cause us to worship you genuinely in spirit and in truth.
[00:38:39.240 --> 00:38:41.680]   May your name be glorified in all things.
[00:38:41.680 --> 00:38:43.080]   In Jesus' name we pray, Amen.
