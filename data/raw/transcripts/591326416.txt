[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.920]   Hi, my name is Tiffany and today I'll be sharing my testimony with you guys.
[00:00:09.920 --> 00:00:14.240]   I grew up in an American Christian international school in China where I had the privilege
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:18.240]   to learn about Christ starting from a young age.
[00:00:18.240 --> 00:00:22.080]   Memorizing scripture, hearing Bible stories, and singing children praise songs at school
[00:00:22.080 --> 00:00:25.200]   were routinely embedded into my weekly schedule.
[00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:29.040]   I prayed to receive Christ as my Lord and Savior when I was seven.
[00:00:29.040 --> 00:00:34.560]   I had a terrible fear of sharks after accidentally catching a glimpse of the movie Jaws at my
[00:00:34.560 --> 00:00:35.560]   cousin's house.
[00:00:35.560 --> 00:00:40.760]   And my parents shared the gospel with me one summer afternoon and told me the power Jesus
[00:00:40.760 --> 00:00:45.720]   has to quiet the seas and triumph over any evil spirit and demon.
[00:00:45.720 --> 00:00:51.040]   Christ seemed real to me and I prayed to receive Christ that day in my life at home.
[00:00:51.040 --> 00:00:55.840]   As a Taiwanese American at a school in China with predominantly Korean students, I was
[00:00:55.840 --> 00:00:58.280]   always a minority who wanted to fit in.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:01.480]   As a result, I frequently worked to draw attention to myself.
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:07.280]   I lied to my peers and exaggerated my circumstances to receive praise and empathy from them.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:12.280]   I have come to realize how foolish and futile my efforts were because salvation is truly
[00:01:12.280 --> 00:01:16.440]   the work of God from beginning to end, separate from my works.
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:19.120]   I loved Christ, yet he was not my greatest love.
[00:01:19.120 --> 00:01:23.760]   I liked the idea of a Savior from my hellbound destiny, but there wasn't much surrender to
[00:01:23.760 --> 00:01:25.520]   him as my Lord.
[00:01:25.520 --> 00:01:29.120]   In 2015, my family moved back to California.
[00:01:29.120 --> 00:01:34.280]   Going into my sophomore year of high school, I found myself working to fit in once again.
[00:01:34.280 --> 00:01:37.880]   Some of my friends struggled with depression and suicidal thoughts.
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.180]   I wrestled to understand why God would place such trials in people's lives.
[00:01:42.180 --> 00:01:46.400]   My heart went out to them and I desired to be a light, but my efforts were inherently
[00:01:46.400 --> 00:01:52.200]   selfish and ultimately ineffective because I thought that I could save them.
[00:01:52.200 --> 00:01:55.080]   And I felt guilty when I saw that I couldn't.
[00:01:55.080 --> 00:01:59.760]   My bitterness also surfaced in having a bad attitude towards my parents.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:03.680]   And in the midst of it all, I found myself face to face with my repeated sins of lying
[00:02:03.680 --> 00:02:07.400]   and working to gain the pity and approval of man.
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:12.120]   Even in the way I wrote my testimony, I highlighted instances that were self-glorifying.
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:17.840]   In my mind, I said that Christ is enough for me, but in my heart, he felt so intangible.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:22.000]   Christ humbled me, reminding me he is the way, the truth, and the life, as he tells
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:24.520]   us in John 14 6.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:28.720]   Putting myself on a pedestal and giving myself the glory was only drawing my friends further
[00:02:28.720 --> 00:02:33.360]   away from Christ as I unintentionally encouraged them to find refuge in the brokenness of a
[00:02:33.360 --> 00:02:36.700]   fallen world, as I myself was also doing.
[00:02:36.700 --> 00:02:42.400]   I got baptized by sprinkling on Easter in 2017 with a desire to publicly proclaim and
[00:02:42.400 --> 00:02:44.760]   commit my faith in Christ.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:49.840]   A mentor convinced me to sign up for a discipleship course the summer after I graduated from high
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:50.840]   school.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:55.600]   For the first time, I truly understood how secular remedies are only band-aid fixes that
[00:02:55.600 --> 00:02:59.320]   never truly tackle the heart of the issue, sin.
[00:02:59.320 --> 00:03:05.160]   I began to understand how no earthly person or thing can heal the void in people's hearts.
[00:03:05.160 --> 00:03:07.800]   Christ is the only one who can satisfy.
[00:03:07.800 --> 00:03:11.360]   During the course, the pastor asked me how I thought God viewed me and where I would
[00:03:11.360 --> 00:03:13.200]   go if I died that day.
[00:03:13.200 --> 00:03:16.160]   I knew the answer, but I surely did not feel it.
[00:03:16.160 --> 00:03:20.760]   Years of feeling like I did not belong, coupled with the deceit I told both others and my
[00:03:20.760 --> 00:03:25.640]   self made me feel unworthy of his love.
[00:03:25.640 --> 00:03:30.200]   Through the mentor and his pastor's demonstration of Christ's love, I started to ask myself
[00:03:30.200 --> 00:03:33.920]   why I felt the need to chase after the approval of mankind.
[00:03:33.920 --> 00:03:38.880]   I came to a deeper understanding that salvation is truly by faith and faith alone.
[00:03:38.880 --> 00:03:43.120]   God is working, even when my heart may seem cold and he may seem distant.
[00:03:43.120 --> 00:03:45.640]   In my first year of college, I joined a small group.
[00:03:45.640 --> 00:03:50.480]   I started doing daily devotions and reading scripture for myself for the first time.
[00:03:50.480 --> 00:03:55.440]   Rather than reading the Bible and memorizing verses for an A on an exam, his truth started
[00:03:55.440 --> 00:03:58.320]   transferring from head knowledge to heart knowledge.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:03.120]   I understood I cannot serve two gods at once by seeking the simultaneous approval of both
[00:04:03.120 --> 00:04:05.160]   God and man.
[00:04:05.160 --> 00:04:10.400]   Matthew 16.35 says, "For whoever would save his life will lose it, but whoever loses his
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.400]   life for my sake will find it."
[00:04:12.400 --> 00:04:17.000]   I am called to deny myself and take up my cross daily and follow him.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.200]   I have come to recognize there is no greater joy in life than to know Christ.
[00:04:21.200 --> 00:04:25.840]   The world and all its riches will waste away and thus placing any hope in the fleeting
[00:04:25.840 --> 00:04:28.800]   gratifications the world may offer is futile.
[00:04:28.800 --> 00:04:33.400]   He pursues me relentlessly, even when I push him away, thinking that I know better and
[00:04:33.400 --> 00:04:36.880]   assuring myself that my sinful ways would get me further.
[00:04:36.880 --> 00:04:41.200]   I am so undeserving of his grace, yet his love that surpasses all understanding is a
[00:04:41.200 --> 00:04:43.560]   mystery that I am so thankful for.
[00:04:43.560 --> 00:04:47.720]   I am getting baptized through immersion to complete the picture of baptism the way Christ
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:48.720]   commanded.
[00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:53.400]   As a follower of Christ, I want to mirror what he has modeled and called me to do.
[00:04:53.400 --> 00:04:57.400]   While salvation does not promise me a life free from troubles, I know Christ is truly
[00:04:57.400 --> 00:05:01.280]   enough for me and my home is ultimately not on this earth.
[00:05:01.280 --> 00:05:06.560]   I am far from perfect and I still sin daily, but I know that my identity is in Christ and
[00:05:06.560 --> 00:05:08.760]   only he can truly satisfy.
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:15.760]   I know my future is in his hands and I want to follow where he leads me.
[00:05:15.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   Amen.
[00:05:16.760 --> 00:05:16.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:17.760 --> 00:05:21.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:21.760 --> 00:05:26.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:26.760 --> 00:05:31.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:31.760 --> 00:05:36.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:36.760 --> 00:05:41.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:41.760 --> 00:05:46.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:46.760 --> 00:05:51.760]   [Applause]
[00:05:51.760 --> 00:05:58.760]   [Applause]
