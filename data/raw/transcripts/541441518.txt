[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.600]   Hi everyone, I'm Calista and I'm a fourth year at UCI.
[00:00:09.600 --> 00:00:10.600]   This is my testimony.
[00:00:10.600 --> 00:00:14.640]   I was born into a Christian household and grew up in the church.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:18.720]   I gained a lot of biblical knowledge but was never truly convicted of my sins.
[00:00:18.720 --> 00:00:22.880]   I started college believing that I was saved and decided that I would check out brewing
[00:00:22.880 --> 00:00:23.880]   with my roommate.
[00:00:23.880 --> 00:00:28.600]   However, when I came to my very first brewing service, I felt ashamed and guilty after the
[00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:33.800]   sermon because I knew deep down that I was sinning just as the message had described.
[00:00:33.800 --> 00:00:37.560]   But rather than turning to repentance from these convictions, the pridefulness of my
[00:00:37.560 --> 00:00:42.120]   own heart led me to distance myself from the church in order to escape from having to humble
[00:00:42.120 --> 00:00:45.120]   myself in admitting that I was a sinner.
[00:00:45.120 --> 00:00:49.440]   My first two years of college were lived in fear of man rather than God as I chose to
[00:00:49.440 --> 00:00:51.880]   base my worth on how people viewed me.
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.800]   As a result, I did not pursue knowing the Lord and lived a life solely trying to fulfill
[00:00:55.800 --> 00:00:57.640]   my own desires.
[00:00:57.640 --> 00:01:00.800]   During my sophomore year, I ended up falling into depression.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.240]   I was constantly wondering why I didn't have a purpose in life and struggled to understand
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:07.400]   why my existence even mattered.
[00:01:07.400 --> 00:01:10.920]   Because I found my worth in my friendships, I was let down time and time again.
[00:01:10.920 --> 00:01:15.720]   Ironically enough, it was during this time period where I continued to tell my non-believing
[00:01:15.720 --> 00:01:18.240]   friends that I was a Christian.
[00:01:18.240 --> 00:01:22.160]   Despite living in complete disobedience to God, I was still selfish in my own thoughts
[00:01:22.160 --> 00:01:26.120]   by demanding God to show his love to me through my circumstances.
[00:01:26.120 --> 00:01:30.920]   I questioned why God would allow me to suffer so much if he truly cared about me.
[00:01:30.920 --> 00:01:35.640]   At the end of my sophomore year, it took not just one but two near-death experiences for
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:39.960]   me to finally realize how far I had fallen from the God that I so claimed to have a personal
[00:01:39.960 --> 00:01:41.400]   relationship with.
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:45.480]   By his grace, the many years of struggling and these sobering experiences caused me to
[00:01:45.480 --> 00:01:49.080]   finally humble myself and admit that I was not truly saved.
[00:01:49.080 --> 00:01:53.240]   I came back to Bruin with a strong desire to know more about God and to have a genuine
[00:01:53.240 --> 00:01:54.720]   relationship with him.
[00:01:54.720 --> 00:01:59.160]   I understood that reconciliation with God was not going to be through my own works,
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:03.560]   but that it would ultimately be through Christ's sacrifice that I would be able to be saved.
[00:02:03.560 --> 00:02:07.320]   Just as Ephesians 2.8 says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith, and this
[00:02:07.320 --> 00:02:09.040]   is not of yourselves.
[00:02:09.040 --> 00:02:13.080]   It is the gift of God, not a result of works so that no one may boast."
[00:02:13.080 --> 00:02:16.560]   I understood that I was a sinner but made righteous through his sacrifice and faith
[00:02:16.560 --> 00:02:17.920]   in Christ alone.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:21.600]   This led me to complete dependence on him in knowing that he is truly the only one that
[00:02:21.600 --> 00:02:23.560]   can save me from my sins.
[00:02:23.560 --> 00:02:27.360]   When COVID hit and I had to move home for quarantine, God used the time of physical
[00:02:27.360 --> 00:02:31.040]   separation from the church body to grow me in my faith.
[00:02:31.040 --> 00:02:35.880]   I am thankful because God used that time to convict me of my sins and bring me to repentance.
[00:02:35.880 --> 00:02:40.360]   I now understand the weight of my sins and how much I am in need of Christ as my savior.
[00:02:40.360 --> 00:02:44.280]   I am eternally grateful for his mercy and grace that he would send his own son, Jesus
[00:02:44.280 --> 00:02:47.640]   Christ, to die for me and I surrender my life to follow him.
[00:02:47.640 --> 00:02:51.800]   I desire to live out Galatians 2.20 which says, "I have been crucified with Christ and
[00:02:51.800 --> 00:02:55.640]   it is no longer I who live but Christ lives in me and the life which I now live in the
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:59.800]   flesh I live by faith in the son of God who loved me and gave himself up for me."
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   Thank you.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:20.800]   [applause]
[00:03:20.800 --> 00:03:36.800]   [applause]
