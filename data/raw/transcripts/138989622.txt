[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.400]   If you would turn your Bibles over to 1 Corinthians chapter 8.
[00:00:09.400 --> 00:00:14.720]   As many of you guys know, on Thursday night we're covering the book of 1 Corinthians and
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:19.520]   it's been a quietly awesome study.
[00:00:19.520 --> 00:00:22.680]   As you guys turn over there, I want to introduce a little bit.
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:28.720]   You know, I used to think that the book of 1 Corinthians is just a slap in the face,
[00:00:28.720 --> 00:00:29.720]   you know.
[00:00:29.720 --> 00:00:34.800]   If some of you guys are those people, I forget the term, but there are people who like pain.
[00:00:34.800 --> 00:00:38.080]   And if you want to get hurt a little bit, you read the book of 1 Corinthians and it
[00:00:38.080 --> 00:00:44.320]   just slaps you around, dealing with all sorts of sin and pride and, you know, conflict in
[00:00:44.320 --> 00:00:45.960]   the church.
[00:00:45.960 --> 00:00:49.360]   And I always viewed the book of 1 Corinthians like that.
[00:00:49.360 --> 00:00:51.560]   It's just rebuke after rebuke.
[00:00:51.560 --> 00:00:57.560]   But the fact of the matter is, I think, you know, so much of scripture is so much more.
[00:00:57.560 --> 00:01:01.440]   It's the way that it is more is it's a book on wisdom.
[00:01:01.440 --> 00:01:03.520]   How you make your decisions.
[00:01:03.520 --> 00:01:08.360]   And it teaches you in areas of your life where you make application, it teaches you how to
[00:01:08.360 --> 00:01:10.080]   decide what do I do?
[00:01:10.080 --> 00:01:12.000]   How am I supposed to think about this?
[00:01:12.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   Okay.
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:18.860]   And by way of introducing this, I personally think that's a great aspect and character
[00:01:18.860 --> 00:01:23.080]   trait of somebody that I really admire.
[00:01:23.080 --> 00:01:27.780]   I like it when I see somebody who's strong mentally and they know how to decide this
[00:01:27.780 --> 00:01:30.160]   is what we need to do in this moment.
[00:01:30.160 --> 00:01:35.640]   You guys have all seen recent, you know, comic book movies, the Avengers.
[00:01:35.640 --> 00:01:36.640]   Okay.
[00:01:36.640 --> 00:01:42.200]   Who's the guy who's always telling people what to do?
[00:01:42.200 --> 00:01:44.280]   Captain America, right?
[00:01:44.280 --> 00:01:47.480]   Here's this guy who's like a goody two-shoe guy, but he always seems to be like, okay,
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:48.760]   you, you do this, you do that.
[00:01:48.760 --> 00:01:51.080]   And even to Hulk is like, you go do this thing.
[00:01:51.080 --> 00:01:54.000]   And everyone's like, and then they just go.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:55.000]   And isn't that kind of noble?
[00:01:55.000 --> 00:01:57.600]   It's like, wow, he has such clout.
[00:01:57.600 --> 00:02:01.520]   He has such authority, but it's not because he's a mean jerky guy.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:05.600]   He's just happens to be a man who knows how to decide in this moment.
[00:02:05.600 --> 00:02:07.820]   This is what we as a team needs to do.
[00:02:07.820 --> 00:02:10.920]   And I admire that because I'm going to be honest here.
[00:02:10.920 --> 00:02:12.800]   I'm not that at all.
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:17.200]   You know, even to the smallest decisions when we were like working on the building, working
[00:02:17.200 --> 00:02:20.080]   on the other side, pastor Peter would always ask me a question.
[00:02:20.080 --> 00:02:21.080]   Does this look good?
[00:02:21.080 --> 00:02:22.080]   What do you think?
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.080]   You know, like that's my answer to everything.
[00:02:25.080 --> 00:02:27.160]   It's like, well, what do you think?
[00:02:27.160 --> 00:02:30.200]   Because I take a long time to start processing.
[00:02:30.200 --> 00:02:34.400]   And also, um, you know, we, sometimes we have really busy weekends, multiple events happening,
[00:02:34.400 --> 00:02:38.840]   and then be able to ask me, what should we do?
[00:02:38.840 --> 00:02:41.040]   And then she was like, I'll let you get back to me later.
[00:02:41.040 --> 00:02:44.720]   Cause I'm just sitting there like, I don't know sometimes how to decide, okay, this is
[00:02:44.720 --> 00:02:46.760]   what we're going to do because this is what's important.
[00:02:46.760 --> 00:02:48.080]   And this is our criteria.
[00:02:48.080 --> 00:02:50.720]   We wanted to do this.
[00:02:50.720 --> 00:02:55.840]   So that's why if you're like me, you want things spelled out crystal clear in the Bible,
[00:02:55.840 --> 00:02:56.840]   right?
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:02:58.800]   You want things told this is right.
[00:02:58.800 --> 00:02:59.800]   This is wrong.
[00:02:59.800 --> 00:03:00.800]   This is what you need to do.
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:07.780]   But truth is the Bible doesn't address every single scenario in our lives.
[00:03:07.780 --> 00:03:11.680]   You know, everything from your personal relationship of dating and all that kind of stuff to school,
[00:03:11.680 --> 00:03:12.680]   career, family.
[00:03:13.240 --> 00:03:18.080]   It gives you a lot, but it doesn't cover every single scenario.
[00:03:18.080 --> 00:03:21.240]   And to those scenarios, we have to practice our discernment.
[00:03:21.240 --> 00:03:23.240]   We have to practice our judgment.
[00:03:23.240 --> 00:03:29.280]   And to me, the character trait of being able to judge appropriately, that's maturity.
[00:03:29.280 --> 00:03:34.480]   And so when I see veterans of the faith who've lived their lives, they've addressed scenarios,
[00:03:34.480 --> 00:03:37.760]   they've experienced certain things and come out of that, not just like, Ooh, I got felt
[00:03:37.760 --> 00:03:40.320]   beat up, but they started to learn principles.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:41.800]   They know now what to do.
[00:03:41.800 --> 00:03:43.040]   They know now what to learn.
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.920]   They look in hindsight and they're able to discern this was right.
[00:03:46.920 --> 00:03:47.920]   This was wrong.
[00:03:47.920 --> 00:03:50.040]   Even if it hurt, it was right.
[00:03:50.040 --> 00:03:51.040]   I look at that kind of stuff.
[00:03:51.040 --> 00:03:54.160]   I'm like, wow, that is normal.
[00:03:54.160 --> 00:03:55.160]   Okay.
[00:03:55.160 --> 00:04:01.400]   Well, in the book of first Corinthians, apostle Paul, like a spiritual father, initially he
[00:04:01.400 --> 00:04:03.280]   is quite upset.
[00:04:03.280 --> 00:04:07.240]   So he starts to point out, starting from chapter one, all the various things that's in the
[00:04:07.240 --> 00:04:09.040]   life of the church.
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:11.640]   You guys are worldly arrogant.
[00:04:11.640 --> 00:04:14.280]   You think you're so wise and he rebukes them.
[00:04:14.280 --> 00:04:17.000]   Some of you guys are competitive and you compete with each other.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.080]   I'm of Paul, I'm of a Paulus, you know, I'm of Jesus.
[00:04:21.080 --> 00:04:22.080]   I don't need nobody.
[00:04:22.080 --> 00:04:23.720]   And they start competing with each other.
[00:04:23.720 --> 00:04:24.720]   Bad.
[00:04:24.720 --> 00:04:27.200]   They have, they have immoral acts in the church.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:28.200]   Bad.
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:31.120]   And then they have, you know, they basically wage war on each other and take each other
[00:04:31.120 --> 00:04:32.120]   to court.
[00:04:32.120 --> 00:04:33.120]   Bad.
[00:04:33.120 --> 00:04:34.480]   Paul, Paul starts to rebuke those things.
[00:04:34.480 --> 00:04:37.160]   And that's typically what we think of first Corinthians.
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:42.760]   But actually the huge chunk of the letter is a response to their questions.
[00:04:42.760 --> 00:04:49.200]   If you turn in your Bibles real quickly, look at chapter seven, verse one, he says, now
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:54.400]   concerning the things about which you wrote, it is good for a man not to touch a woman.
[00:04:54.400 --> 00:04:58.940]   Now I only read that passage because I want to show you apostle Paul, again, as a good
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:02.960]   father and teacher, he's interacting with the church and he's answering some of their
[00:05:02.960 --> 00:05:03.960]   questions.
[00:05:03.960 --> 00:05:08.760]   And in so answering, he's giving them not just, you know, just the answer, but he's
[00:05:08.760 --> 00:05:09.960]   giving them wisdom.
[00:05:09.960 --> 00:05:12.120]   This is how you need to decide.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:14.080]   This is how you need to think.
[00:05:14.080 --> 00:05:17.080]   And you, if you're going to mature, you need to judge appropriately.
[00:05:17.080 --> 00:05:18.080]   Okay.
[00:05:18.080 --> 00:05:21.960]   So let me give you a sampling of some of those things.
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:23.720]   Go to chapter six, verse 12.
[00:05:23.720 --> 00:05:26.800]   We just studied this a couple of days ago on Thursday.
[00:05:26.800 --> 00:05:32.740]   But in chapter six, verse 12, he'll say, all things are lawful for me, but not all things
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:34.600]   are profitable.
[00:05:34.600 --> 00:05:38.240]   All things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
[00:05:38.240 --> 00:05:39.240]   Good.
[00:05:39.240 --> 00:05:42.720]   When you read the Bible and you see stuff like that, those are principles you need to
[00:05:42.720 --> 00:05:43.720]   take in.
[00:05:43.720 --> 00:05:46.640]   There are people who think, look, everything is lawful.
[00:05:46.640 --> 00:05:47.640]   Everything is fine.
[00:05:47.640 --> 00:05:51.200]   But apostle Paul asks, but is it profitable?
[00:05:51.200 --> 00:05:53.040]   You need to ask that.
[00:05:53.040 --> 00:05:55.360]   In judging and trying to decide, should I do this?
[00:05:55.360 --> 00:05:56.600]   Should I not?
[00:05:56.600 --> 00:06:00.400]   In various gray issues of Christian faith, whether, you know, I'm going to bring them
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.440]   up, there's like drinking, smoking, tattoos, going to lounges, going to do all this stuff.
[00:06:06.440 --> 00:06:09.400]   I'm not going to tell you my perspective on those now.
[00:06:09.400 --> 00:06:14.320]   What I am going to say is you should apply biblical principles, shouldn't you?
[00:06:14.320 --> 00:06:18.960]   Apostle Paul says, all things are lawful, even for me, but not all things are profitable.
[00:06:18.960 --> 00:06:21.600]   And I read that in chapter 10 of 1 Corinthians as well.
[00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:23.400]   So you know this is a theme.
[00:06:23.400 --> 00:06:28.280]   He'll even say, all things are lawful for me, but I will not be mastered by anything.
[00:06:28.280 --> 00:06:30.440]   Is anything in excess?
[00:06:30.440 --> 00:06:32.100]   Is it controlling you?
[00:06:32.100 --> 00:06:33.100]   Is it dominating?
[00:06:33.100 --> 00:06:36.640]   Is it making your life really lopsided?
[00:06:36.640 --> 00:06:38.000]   And it's not good for you.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:41.920]   Even if it seems like a good thing, even if it's work, if it's completely lopsided and
[00:06:41.920 --> 00:06:47.880]   dominating your life, making it, making you its slave, it's absolutely not good for you.
[00:06:47.880 --> 00:06:49.820]   You see how this principles are applied, right?
[00:06:49.820 --> 00:06:53.800]   This is the wisdom that you need to exercise in your life.
[00:06:53.800 --> 00:06:55.280]   There's more.
[00:06:55.280 --> 00:06:59.440]   So just by warning, this is like the longest introduction I've ever given, but there's
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:00.440]   more.
[00:07:00.440 --> 00:07:02.760]   There's like so many principles.
[00:07:02.760 --> 00:07:08.440]   Verse 15 of chapter 6, he'll say, do you not know that your body is on the members of Christ?
[00:07:08.440 --> 00:07:13.620]   Verse 19, do you not know that your body is a temple of the Holy Spirit who is in you?
[00:07:13.620 --> 00:07:17.080]   These are spiritual principle truths that never change.
[00:07:17.080 --> 00:07:19.720]   Now you need to apply with your discretion.
[00:07:19.720 --> 00:07:24.640]   If I am identified with Christ, what should I do with my body?
[00:07:24.640 --> 00:07:30.160]   If I am representative of Christ's body, if literally I am one with him and the spirit
[00:07:30.160 --> 00:07:35.680]   of God dwells in me and you, in this context, it's not you the church, it's you as an individual,
[00:07:35.680 --> 00:07:41.540]   you are the temple of the presence of the Holy Spirit, you got to exercise your own
[00:07:41.540 --> 00:07:44.080]   brain to decide what do I do?
[00:07:44.080 --> 00:07:48.840]   See this is what Apostle Paul is a good teacher and good father, is instructing the church.
[00:07:48.840 --> 00:07:49.840]   And there's more.
[00:07:49.840 --> 00:07:54.140]   The last time I preached here, I believe I preached out of chapter 7, verse 35.
[00:07:54.140 --> 00:07:56.320]   This was a crucial one.
[00:07:56.320 --> 00:08:00.960]   He says, but I say this for your own benefit.
[00:08:00.960 --> 00:08:03.560]   Again, this is verse 35 of chapter 7.
[00:08:03.560 --> 00:08:09.620]   Not to put a restraint upon you, but to promote what is appropriate and to secure undistracted
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:11.120]   devotion to the Lord.
[00:08:11.120 --> 00:08:14.720]   When was the last time you were sitting there like, man, should I go with these people or
[00:08:14.720 --> 00:08:15.720]   should I not?
[00:08:15.720 --> 00:08:20.520]   And you asked, does this contribute to my devotion to God?
[00:08:20.520 --> 00:08:21.520]   Yes or no?
[00:08:21.520 --> 00:08:24.740]   Does this make me more committed or less committed to the Lord?
[00:08:24.740 --> 00:08:25.740]   Right?
[00:08:25.740 --> 00:08:30.640]   I mean, think, if we lived our lives like that, where the vast majority of our decisions
[00:08:30.640 --> 00:08:36.560]   were based on is it profitable, is it dominating, is it in line with my identity, is it causing
[00:08:36.560 --> 00:08:41.800]   me to be more in love and more devoted to Christ, I mean, we would be wise individuals,
[00:08:41.800 --> 00:08:42.800]   right?
[00:08:42.800 --> 00:08:48.340]   But the fact of the matter is, I make it sound easy, but that's not easy.
[00:08:48.340 --> 00:08:52.300]   In the moment, perhaps of your own desire, the temptations and lurements, or even in
[00:08:52.300 --> 00:08:57.820]   the moment of trying to decide what do I do, you've got to start running in your mind and
[00:08:57.820 --> 00:09:00.500]   start discerning these things and it's not easy.
[00:09:00.500 --> 00:09:03.380]   Well, one of the issues, so now we're going to chapter 8.
[00:09:03.380 --> 00:09:10.380]   One of the issues in chapter 8 that they come across is the issue of food offered to idols.
[00:09:10.380 --> 00:09:11.380]   So take a look here.
[00:09:11.380 --> 00:09:13.240]   I'm going to read the whole passage.
[00:09:13.240 --> 00:09:15.580]   Chapter 8 reads like this.
[00:09:15.580 --> 00:09:22.560]   Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge, but knowledge
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:26.220]   makes arrogant, but love edifies.
[00:09:26.220 --> 00:09:31.020]   If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know.
[00:09:31.020 --> 00:09:34.140]   But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.
[00:09:34.140 --> 00:09:38.660]   Therefore, concerning the eating of things sacrificed to idols, we know that there is
[00:09:38.660 --> 00:09:43.500]   no such thing as an idol in the world and that there is no God but one.
[00:09:43.500 --> 00:09:47.420]   For even if there are so-called gods, whether in heaven or on earth, as indeed there are
[00:09:47.420 --> 00:09:52.700]   many gods and many lords, yet for us there is but one God, the Father, from whom are
[00:09:52.700 --> 00:09:58.580]   all things and we exist for him, and one Lord Jesus Christ by whom are all things and we
[00:09:58.580 --> 00:10:00.060]   exist through him.
[00:10:00.060 --> 00:10:05.220]   However, not all men have this knowledge, but some, being accustomed to the idol until
[00:10:05.220 --> 00:10:10.180]   now, eat food as if it were sacrifice to an idol and their conscience, being weak, is
[00:10:10.180 --> 00:10:11.180]   defiled.
[00:10:11.180 --> 00:10:13.660]   But food will not condemn us to God.
[00:10:13.660 --> 00:10:17.760]   We are neither the worse if we do not eat it, nor the better if we do eat it.
[00:10:17.760 --> 00:10:21.700]   But take care that this liberty of yours does not somehow become a stumbling block to the
[00:10:21.700 --> 00:10:22.700]   weak.
[00:10:22.700 --> 00:10:28.180]   For if someone sees you who have knowledge dining at an idol's temple, will not his
[00:10:28.180 --> 00:10:33.100]   conscience, if he is weak, be strengthened to eat things sacrificed to idols?
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:38.060]   For through your knowledge he who is weak is ruined, the brother for whose sake Christ
[00:10:38.060 --> 00:10:39.060]   died.
[00:10:39.060 --> 00:10:43.660]   And so by sinning against the brethren and wounding their conscience when it is weak,
[00:10:43.660 --> 00:10:45.260]   you sin against Christ.
[00:10:45.260 --> 00:10:51.020]   Therefore, if food causes my brother to stumble, I will never eat meat again, so that I will
[00:10:51.020 --> 00:10:53.140]   not cause my brother to stumble.
[00:10:53.140 --> 00:10:54.140]   Amen.
[00:10:54.140 --> 00:11:00.260]   Let's take a moment to pray and to ask the Lord's blessing on our time in the word.
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:02.620]   Father God, we do thank you for your truth.
[00:11:02.620 --> 00:11:05.500]   God, it is your truth that enlightens us.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:09.860]   It is your truth that gives us our direction and path.
[00:11:09.860 --> 00:11:14.060]   But God, grant us this morning humility and acceptance in our hearts that we would not
[00:11:14.060 --> 00:11:18.860]   rebel against your word, but God, we'd be fully in submission to your wisdom.
[00:11:18.860 --> 00:11:24.500]   Lord, your scriptures often challenge us to go beyond what is normal, that goes beyond
[00:11:24.500 --> 00:11:26.340]   what is comfortable for us.
[00:11:26.340 --> 00:11:30.180]   But I pray, Father God, knowing that there is much blessing when we abide in you, help
[00:11:30.180 --> 00:11:33.460]   us, Father God, to completely fulfill your word.
[00:11:33.460 --> 00:11:34.460]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:34.460]   Amen.
[00:11:34.460 --> 00:11:35.460]   Amen.
[00:11:35.460 --> 00:11:36.460]   Okay.
[00:11:36.460 --> 00:11:42.780]   So, we look at this scenario, and so I painted this picture for you that we need wisdom and
[00:11:42.780 --> 00:11:48.820]   discretion to apply the biblical principles in life areas that aren't explicit in the
[00:11:48.820 --> 00:11:49.820]   Bible.
[00:11:49.820 --> 00:11:54.660]   But rather, they're life areas where it could be gray, it could go one way or the other.
[00:11:54.660 --> 00:11:56.700]   And you saw the scenario here.
[00:11:56.700 --> 00:11:59.900]   You saw what they perhaps wrote about to Apostle Paul.
[00:11:59.900 --> 00:12:04.660]   Dear Paul, our father in the faith, we've got a big problem.
[00:12:04.660 --> 00:12:06.740]   I love meat, but the guy says no.
[00:12:06.740 --> 00:12:10.620]   Okay, that's kind of like the scenario that you see.
[00:12:10.620 --> 00:12:15.580]   You see a group of people who perhaps, maybe the people who are writing the letter were
[00:12:15.580 --> 00:12:19.260]   probably people who were a long time in the church, because they probably had that relationship
[00:12:19.260 --> 00:12:20.260]   with Apostle Paul.
[00:12:20.260 --> 00:12:21.260]   Perhaps.
[00:12:21.260 --> 00:12:24.460]   I'm just reading into the, behind the lines there, so understand that.
[00:12:24.460 --> 00:12:27.460]   But perhaps are the people who know better, because they're sitting here thinking, you
[00:12:27.460 --> 00:12:28.460]   know what?
[00:12:28.460 --> 00:12:31.780]   I read here, there's people with issues.
[00:12:31.780 --> 00:12:32.780]   There's people who are weak.
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:36.220]   There are people who have problem with me eating, but the fact of the matter is we know
[00:12:36.220 --> 00:12:37.940]   there is no other idols.
[00:12:37.940 --> 00:12:40.540]   All that's fake.
[00:12:40.540 --> 00:12:44.140]   And so now you have, I'm going to stand here, representative of one group, you have a group
[00:12:44.140 --> 00:12:47.100]   of people who are saying, this is not wrong.
[00:12:47.100 --> 00:12:49.340]   We should be able to eat.
[00:12:49.340 --> 00:12:54.740]   But then there is a pointing at the people who are on this side, no, no, no, no, no.
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.060]   We can't eat that meat.
[00:12:56.060 --> 00:12:57.380]   It's been offered to idols.
[00:12:57.380 --> 00:12:58.380]   It's pagan.
[00:12:58.380 --> 00:12:59.700]   You know, how dare we?
[00:12:59.700 --> 00:13:02.540]   And if they were Jewish, it'd be like, no way.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.540]   Right?
[00:13:03.540 --> 00:13:05.300]   We're going to die if we eat that.
[00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:07.300]   So you see this conflict happening.
[00:13:07.300 --> 00:13:12.020]   Now, as I was thinking about this, I was trying to think of something that maybe is in corollary
[00:13:12.020 --> 00:13:14.340]   to our day and age.
[00:13:14.340 --> 00:13:16.420]   I couldn't think of one.
[00:13:16.420 --> 00:13:19.660]   So what I would like you to do is imagine you're in India.
[00:13:19.660 --> 00:13:20.660]   Okay.
[00:13:20.660 --> 00:13:23.820]   Recently, we just heard Wednesday from a pastor who was out in India.
[00:13:23.820 --> 00:13:29.300]   His name is Pastor Ramesh, and he's talking about how if you're an Indian, you're essentially
[00:13:29.300 --> 00:13:30.580]   Hindu.
[00:13:30.580 --> 00:13:33.580]   Your faith is so tied with your culture.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:35.260]   It's like almost inseparable.
[00:13:35.260 --> 00:13:37.820]   And if you tried, the people would attack you.
[00:13:37.820 --> 00:13:40.060]   And that's why they're so resistant to Christianity.
[00:13:40.060 --> 00:13:44.020]   Because if you go over and you say, oh, you have to convert.
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:47.020]   And Christianity says, there's only one way, man.
[00:13:47.020 --> 00:13:48.300]   Not many guys, not many ways.
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:49.300]   It's just one.
[00:13:49.300 --> 00:13:51.260]   Then they just get really livid.
[00:13:51.260 --> 00:13:52.260]   Right?
[00:13:52.260 --> 00:13:57.540]   And the reason being is because they believe, the Hindus believe in just a conglomerate
[00:13:57.540 --> 00:13:59.260]   of all kinds of gods.
[00:13:59.260 --> 00:14:01.420]   So you can have animal gods.
[00:14:01.420 --> 00:14:02.700]   You can have object gods.
[00:14:02.700 --> 00:14:06.580]   And Pastor Ramesh was saying his family chose the snake.
[00:14:06.580 --> 00:14:08.620]   And to the snake, they would offer fruit.
[00:14:08.620 --> 00:14:10.820]   They would offer sacrifice, basically.
[00:14:10.820 --> 00:14:13.700]   And they would have worship services right in front of that thing.
[00:14:13.700 --> 00:14:16.900]   But the fact of the matter is, that being the case, if you were to imagine yourself
[00:14:16.900 --> 00:14:19.620]   in India, and you can hear stories about this sometimes.
[00:14:19.620 --> 00:14:23.020]   So you'll see on the side of the road, you're walking down the road, and you have an individual
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:24.020]   worshiping a cow.
[00:14:24.020 --> 00:14:27.940]   And if the cow happens to go past your car, you're not going to be like, bam, bam, get
[00:14:27.940 --> 00:14:28.940]   out of the way, cow.
[00:14:28.940 --> 00:14:29.940]   Why?
[00:14:29.940 --> 00:14:30.940]   Because that's someone's god.
[00:14:30.940 --> 00:14:32.340]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:32.340 --> 00:14:38.820]   So there in India, the practice of sacrifice to idols isn't just like an isolated event.
[00:14:38.820 --> 00:14:45.060]   I want to paint for you a picture that this probably affected the life of the church greatly.
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.740]   Because it wasn't just a few people.
[00:14:46.740 --> 00:14:50.700]   It wasn't just one meat lover versus the other guy who wanted to be a vegan.
[00:14:50.700 --> 00:14:51.700]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:51.700 --> 00:14:53.500]   It wasn't just two guys going at it.
[00:14:53.500 --> 00:14:58.540]   It was probably a big portion of the church wondering, what do I do?
[00:14:58.540 --> 00:15:03.780]   I go to my sister's wedding, and it's like, do I not eat their food?
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:07.340]   Someone invites me to their house, and it's like, maybe I pack my own sandwich.
[00:15:07.340 --> 00:15:08.340]   I don't know.
[00:15:08.340 --> 00:15:09.340]   Like, what do you do?
[00:15:09.340 --> 00:15:12.540]   It would totally mess up the social environment of the church.
[00:15:12.540 --> 00:15:14.060]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:15:14.060 --> 00:15:18.020]   So that's why actually, Paul the Apostle Paul devotes a huge section of scripture,
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:19.820]   of his letter to this.
[00:15:19.820 --> 00:15:25.660]   This topic runs from chapter 8 all the way down to the first verse of chapter 11.
[00:15:25.660 --> 00:15:29.020]   So it's an important, I'm saying it's an important issue.
[00:15:29.020 --> 00:15:33.420]   Because you guys might be reading this and be like, hmm, I don't know if that's relevant
[00:15:33.420 --> 00:15:34.420]   here.
[00:15:34.420 --> 00:15:39.220]   I don't have a problem eating meat offered to idols, you know?
[00:15:39.220 --> 00:15:42.620]   But he's going to use this as a platform to address a bigger issue.
[00:15:42.620 --> 00:15:45.500]   Now, the bigger issue is this.
[00:15:45.500 --> 00:15:49.100]   He looks at the people who are writing, you know, kind of metaphorically.
[00:15:49.100 --> 00:15:51.260]   He's writing back, and he's addressing them.
[00:15:51.260 --> 00:15:53.540]   And take a look at verse 1 through 3.
[00:15:53.540 --> 00:15:59.980]   He says, "Now concerning things sacrificed to idols, we know that we all have knowledge.
[00:15:59.980 --> 00:16:03.060]   Knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies.
[00:16:03.060 --> 00:16:07.860]   If anyone supposes that he knows anything, he has not yet known as he ought to know.
[00:16:07.860 --> 00:16:11.620]   But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.
[00:16:11.620 --> 00:16:18.980]   Therefore concerning the things sacrificed to idols," and then he goes on.
[00:16:18.980 --> 00:16:23.580]   What I'm saying is, Apostle Paul is trying to teach them a principle to make decisions.
[00:16:23.580 --> 00:16:28.820]   And the principle that exists in chapter 8 is not, is it profitable for you?
[00:16:28.820 --> 00:16:30.260]   Not how is it controlling you?
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:31.740]   Are you in control?
[00:16:31.740 --> 00:16:34.740]   It's not about you.
[00:16:34.740 --> 00:16:41.860]   The criteria by which he wants you to decide now, all the gray areas is, is it loving?
[00:16:41.860 --> 00:16:43.500]   Is it loving?
[00:16:43.500 --> 00:16:48.380]   And so I've entitled my sermon, "Knowledge that Ends in Love."
[00:16:48.380 --> 00:16:50.700]   Knowledge that ends in love.
[00:16:50.700 --> 00:16:54.860]   Because for you, in trying to make a decision about what should I do about this scenario,
[00:16:54.860 --> 00:16:58.940]   not just this scenario, but other scenarios in my life that come up, I need to be able
[00:16:58.940 --> 00:17:02.740]   to ask the question, is it loving towards my brother?
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.500]   And that question shouldn't be just a passing thought, it should be important enough that
[00:17:06.500 --> 00:17:10.540]   it radically changes how you live.
[00:17:10.540 --> 00:17:12.260]   It should.
[00:17:12.260 --> 00:17:16.780]   So today, we're actually going to be tackling that, just one aspect of it.
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:20.300]   So this is actually part one of a two-part sermon.
[00:17:20.300 --> 00:17:25.620]   I'm going to be preaching again August 16th, so every single one of you have to come back.
[00:17:25.620 --> 00:17:26.620]   Okay?
[00:17:26.620 --> 00:17:31.700]   But this is just part one, because he gives an intro almost to the whole thought.
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.980]   He asks, "Are you loving?
[00:17:33.980 --> 00:17:37.780]   Are you loving towards your brother, and are you making decisions based upon this?"
[00:17:37.780 --> 00:17:43.860]   He sees the attitude, the attitude of the people writing, and he makes this first point.
[00:17:43.860 --> 00:17:46.780]   I'm going to have three points today, and the very first point I'm going to tell you
[00:17:46.780 --> 00:17:50.980]   is, admit your ignorance.
[00:17:50.980 --> 00:17:52.540]   Okay?
[00:17:52.540 --> 00:17:54.660]   Admit your ignorance.
[00:17:54.660 --> 00:18:02.260]   Now, I'm saying we should be loving, and we need to make decisions based on, is it loving?
[00:18:02.260 --> 00:18:04.500]   Why start with admit your ignorance?
[00:18:04.500 --> 00:18:07.340]   Is because, let me paint for you a scenario here, okay?
[00:18:07.340 --> 00:18:09.900]   So number one is admit your ignorance.
[00:18:09.900 --> 00:18:11.380]   Here's the one camp of people.
[00:18:11.380 --> 00:18:13.380]   We love meat.
[00:18:13.380 --> 00:18:16.060]   This is a daily part of our lifestyle.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:19.660]   Stop frustrating us, you know?
[00:18:19.660 --> 00:18:22.300]   And you can imagine how frustrating this could be.
[00:18:22.300 --> 00:18:25.740]   Because for a Jew, remember how they make sacrifices?
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:29.260]   They'll have an animal, and a portion of that goes to God, they burn it.
[00:18:29.260 --> 00:18:32.980]   A portion of that goes to the priest, and a portion that you take home.
[00:18:32.980 --> 00:18:34.740]   Remember how frequent sacrifices were?
[00:18:34.740 --> 00:18:38.220]   Remember, think about how important that portion of the meat is then for the family.
[00:18:38.220 --> 00:18:40.980]   So every time you eat meat, it'd be kind of like a family affair.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.780]   What I'm saying is, this is again, not something easy for the people to give up.
[00:18:45.780 --> 00:18:49.900]   It's a part of their culture, it's a part of their family life, it's a part of like
[00:18:49.900 --> 00:18:51.580]   routine things.
[00:18:51.580 --> 00:18:53.820]   And it was like that for pagan idolatry worship too.
[00:18:53.820 --> 00:19:00.700]   They would sacrifice animals, and a portion goes to the altar, a portion to the priest,
[00:19:00.700 --> 00:19:03.020]   and a portion to the family, okay?
[00:19:03.020 --> 00:19:09.120]   So you can imagine these people, these people, being very frustrated about this.
[00:19:09.120 --> 00:19:12.560]   So this is where I want you to think about what I just said, admit your ignorance.
[00:19:12.560 --> 00:19:16.220]   Because the way that they start off is saying, "Well, we know.
[00:19:16.220 --> 00:19:17.220]   We know what's right.
[00:19:17.220 --> 00:19:19.700]   We've already decided and judged what's right."
[00:19:19.700 --> 00:19:23.940]   An apostle Paul says, "Now concerning the thing, sacrifice to idols," this is verse
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.620]   one, "we know that we have the knowledge."
[00:19:26.620 --> 00:19:28.360]   We all have knowledge.
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:33.060]   And then he almost rebukes it by saying, "But knowledge makes arrogant, but love edifies."
[00:19:33.060 --> 00:19:37.740]   You can see him responding to their letter, and I'm imagining their letter sounding like
[00:19:37.740 --> 00:19:38.740]   this.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:41.460]   Apostle Paul, our father, we've got a big issue.
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:43.100]   I've got a question for you.
[00:19:43.100 --> 00:19:46.980]   It's an important theological one.
[00:19:46.980 --> 00:19:49.580]   What are we going to do about those guys?
[00:19:49.580 --> 00:19:51.660]   You ever met people like that?
[00:19:51.660 --> 00:19:53.860]   Where they're asking you a question, but it's not really a question.
[00:19:53.860 --> 00:19:57.740]   They just want to really like you to affirm they've already made a decision.
[00:19:57.740 --> 00:19:59.740]   They're wrong, right?
[00:19:59.740 --> 00:20:01.940]   Have you seen that before?
[00:20:01.940 --> 00:20:06.220]   You could almost sense that that's probably how they wrote the letter, saying like, "Look,
[00:20:06.220 --> 00:20:07.900]   we know what's right here.
[00:20:07.900 --> 00:20:10.740]   What's right is, let's eat."
[00:20:10.740 --> 00:20:11.940]   There's no such thing as an idol.
[00:20:11.940 --> 00:20:13.420]   The idol is an empty vessel.
[00:20:13.420 --> 00:20:17.700]   The idol has an empty reference, meaning it's just a piece to symbolize their God, but there's
[00:20:17.700 --> 00:20:19.300]   nothing behind it.
[00:20:19.300 --> 00:20:21.100]   So this is nothing.
[00:20:21.100 --> 00:20:23.220]   Just eat it, you know?
[00:20:23.220 --> 00:20:25.140]   So they're saying, "We know what's right.
[00:20:25.140 --> 00:20:26.140]   We know what's right."
[00:20:26.140 --> 00:20:33.380]   But Apostle Paul challenged them, and he says, "You think you know what's right, and in your
[00:20:33.380 --> 00:20:36.620]   knowledge you've decided what to do in this stance."
[00:20:36.620 --> 00:20:40.020]   Maybe they're complaining, "Apostle Paul, can you write a letter to them?
[00:20:40.020 --> 00:20:42.020]   Apostle Paul, can you come and make this right?
[00:20:42.020 --> 00:20:45.860]   Apostle Paul, can you jump in and set them straight?
[00:20:45.860 --> 00:20:47.900]   Tell them to be quiet and let us see what we want to eat."
[00:20:47.900 --> 00:20:48.900]   I don't know if they went that far.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.900]   I'm just conjecturing, right?
[00:20:51.900 --> 00:20:59.940]   But Apostle Paul comes back and says, "Your pride, or your knowledge, has made you proud.
[00:20:59.940 --> 00:21:03.340]   Your decision shows your arrogance."
[00:21:03.340 --> 00:21:06.140]   Literally in the Greek it says, "You're so puffed up.
[00:21:06.140 --> 00:21:07.140]   You're like inflated."
[00:21:07.140 --> 00:21:12.780]   Oh, like, "You think it's right, so now I'll apply everybody.
[00:21:12.780 --> 00:21:14.340]   I think it's right.
[00:21:14.340 --> 00:21:15.340]   Everybody eat it."
[00:21:16.140 --> 00:21:19.300]   I don't know if you've ever felt that way, like as a young person.
[00:21:19.300 --> 00:21:24.980]   For me, I remember right when I became Christian, I learned a lot of Christian truths, and then
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:27.020]   it was, "I know what's right.
[00:21:27.020 --> 00:21:29.020]   How come you're not doing it, man?
[00:21:29.020 --> 00:21:30.020]   You don't know?"
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:31.020]   You know?
[00:21:31.020 --> 00:21:36.660]   Have you met those people who are very interested in just revealing what they know?
[00:21:36.660 --> 00:21:41.500]   I get that sense, and Apostle Paul is rebuking them, "Knowledge makes you so proud.
[00:21:41.500 --> 00:21:42.500]   Knowledge makes you arrogant."
[00:21:42.500 --> 00:21:50.780]   See, knowledge in of itself is so insufficient to decide what's right to do, because knowledge
[00:21:50.780 --> 00:21:52.340]   simply ends with you.
[00:21:52.340 --> 00:21:53.940]   I mean, think about this.
[00:21:53.940 --> 00:21:57.300]   You learn something, and what is it good for when you stop right there?
[00:21:57.300 --> 00:21:59.140]   I learn something, I stop.
[00:21:59.140 --> 00:22:00.140]   You know what that's good for?
[00:22:00.140 --> 00:22:02.180]   It's good for nothing but saying, "Look at what I learned.
[00:22:02.180 --> 00:22:03.180]   Look at me.
[00:22:03.180 --> 00:22:04.180]   I know this.
[00:22:04.180 --> 00:22:05.180]   Be wowed.
[00:22:05.180 --> 00:22:06.180]   Be amazed.
[00:22:06.180 --> 00:22:07.180]   I know."
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:13.260]   So, Apostle Paul says, "But what you need to seek is to edify."
[00:22:13.260 --> 00:22:18.700]   But the first step, but the first step is to acknowledge at least you don't know.
[00:22:18.700 --> 00:22:19.700]   So look at what he says.
[00:22:19.700 --> 00:22:24.300]   He says in verse two, "If anyone supposes he knows anything, he has not yet known as
[00:22:24.300 --> 00:22:25.300]   he should."
[00:22:25.300 --> 00:22:29.460]   You think you know, and you claim you know, but you don't really know.
[00:22:29.460 --> 00:22:31.820]   You don't know in the way that you should.
[00:22:31.820 --> 00:22:33.160]   Right?
[00:22:33.160 --> 00:22:34.660]   You don't know the scenario.
[00:22:34.660 --> 00:22:38.060]   You don't understand the environment.
[00:22:38.060 --> 00:22:42.220]   You think you know, but you don't, and you have to admit that.
[00:22:42.220 --> 00:22:44.140]   You know what the crazy thing is?
[00:22:44.140 --> 00:22:52.140]   If you, you know, have ever gotten into conflict with anybody, typically the best way to resolve
[00:22:52.140 --> 00:22:55.540]   that is to first be open, isn't it?
[00:22:55.540 --> 00:22:58.780]   Well, let me be open to why you're upset.
[00:22:58.780 --> 00:23:01.860]   Well, let me be open to why this happened.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.500]   But if you're sitting here, "I'm right, why don't you understand why I'm right?"
[00:23:05.500 --> 00:23:07.700]   You're just going to fight and fight and fight.
[00:23:07.700 --> 00:23:09.820]   You're going to have marathon fights, and it's never going to end.
[00:23:09.820 --> 00:23:11.860]   You're just going to be bitter.
[00:23:11.860 --> 00:23:16.460]   And so in this moment of conflict in the church, Apostle Paul says, "You need to admit your
[00:23:16.460 --> 00:23:17.460]   ignorance."
[00:23:17.460 --> 00:23:22.360]   Pride, or knowledge, makes arrogant.
[00:23:22.360 --> 00:23:27.940]   And then he says, the second part, so first was admit your ignorance, and the second part
[00:23:27.940 --> 00:23:34.020]   he says, "Seek to understand people."
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:35.020]   Why do I say that?
[00:23:35.020 --> 00:23:38.620]   It's because he says love edifies.
[00:23:38.620 --> 00:23:42.940]   And then he starts talking about how love is edifying, and he starts bringing up how
[00:23:42.940 --> 00:23:45.860]   people are, because Apostle Paul is loving like a father.
[00:23:45.860 --> 00:23:48.540]   He understands the rest of the people.
[00:23:48.540 --> 00:23:50.380]   So what am I saying?
[00:23:50.380 --> 00:23:54.980]   In the second part to that instruction, take a look at some of the stuff he says here,
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.360]   right?
[00:23:56.360 --> 00:24:03.700]   Look at how he describes, yes, so verse four through six, he describes and affirms, this
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.380]   is what we know to be true.
[00:24:05.380 --> 00:24:07.380]   This is spiritual reality, right?
[00:24:07.380 --> 00:24:12.020]   We know that there is no such thing as an idol in the world, and there is no God but
[00:24:12.020 --> 00:24:13.020]   one.
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:15.360]   So this is the theological truth.
[00:24:15.360 --> 00:24:19.500]   But then look at verse seven, "However, not all men have this knowledge."
[00:24:19.500 --> 00:24:24.300]   Look, guys, you write me this long letter, you want me to make it right, and you want
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:27.800]   me to jump in, you want me to get involved in your business, but here's something you
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:29.640]   think you know.
[00:24:29.640 --> 00:24:32.700]   But here's something you don't realize.
[00:24:32.700 --> 00:24:36.180]   What about these people who don't know?
[00:24:36.180 --> 00:24:41.260]   So that's why I say you have to seek to understand people, because that's an aspect of you loving
[00:24:41.260 --> 00:24:42.260]   people.
[00:24:42.260 --> 00:24:47.380]   If you seek to edify, if you seek to encourage, you first need to understand.
[00:24:47.380 --> 00:24:54.260]   You see, there are people who don't realize that truth is always given in context.
[00:24:54.260 --> 00:24:57.620]   There are people who think truth is objective truth, everybody should just take it, here
[00:24:57.620 --> 00:24:59.420]   it is, take it.
[00:24:59.420 --> 00:25:02.140]   No, that's not right.
[00:25:02.140 --> 00:25:05.620]   As a young man, I don't speak to a younger person the same way as I speak to an equal
[00:25:05.620 --> 00:25:07.900]   or as I speak to an elder.
[00:25:07.900 --> 00:25:13.340]   If I, right now, I'm preaching so I'm getting animated, my voice is getting loud, I'm not
[00:25:13.340 --> 00:25:17.460]   going to say that exact same thing in the exact same way to somebody in front of me.
[00:25:17.460 --> 00:25:20.740]   Am I going to say the exact same thing to somebody who's hurting, say the exact same
[00:25:20.740 --> 00:25:22.540]   thing to somebody who's weak?
[00:25:22.540 --> 00:25:24.220]   No, I'm not.
[00:25:24.220 --> 00:25:28.100]   Apostle Paul says, "Do you realize some of these people, they don't know.
[00:25:28.100 --> 00:25:32.700]   Some of these people are accustomed to living with idols until now, and they eat their food
[00:25:32.700 --> 00:25:37.500]   as if it were sacrifice to idols, and then their conscience being weak, it's getting
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:38.500]   defiled."
[00:25:38.500 --> 00:25:44.340]   See, a person who is loving will seek to understand that.
[00:25:44.340 --> 00:25:45.980]   Question to you guys.
[00:25:45.980 --> 00:25:49.940]   Guys, categorically, we do that a lot.
[00:25:49.940 --> 00:25:53.540]   Categorically meaning, we like putting people into categories.
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:57.300]   And I like addressing people that way sometimes, because it's just faster.
[00:25:57.300 --> 00:26:00.540]   It just makes life easy.
[00:26:00.540 --> 00:26:05.420]   I talk about dating a lot because I work with the high school, college, and young adult
[00:26:05.420 --> 00:26:06.420]   people.
[00:26:06.420 --> 00:26:07.780]   I talk about dating a lot.
[00:26:07.780 --> 00:26:10.980]   And somebody once teased me and said, "Oh, I think you're like a dating guru."
[00:26:10.980 --> 00:26:12.780]   And I'm like, "No."
[00:26:12.780 --> 00:26:17.220]   But there are times when I make a bunch of good guesses and a bunch of times when I make
[00:26:17.220 --> 00:26:18.220]   really bad ones.
[00:26:18.220 --> 00:26:19.220]   So, here's a good example.
[00:26:19.220 --> 00:26:24.060]   If I'm counseling this one couple, and this guy is like, "Oh my gosh, I need to talk to
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:25.060]   you about something."
[00:26:25.060 --> 00:26:26.060]   I'm like, "Okay."
[00:26:26.060 --> 00:26:27.740]   He's like, "I don't even know if you're going to understand."
[00:26:27.740 --> 00:26:28.740]   I'm like, "Try me."
[00:26:28.740 --> 00:26:29.740]   I talk about this a lot.
[00:26:29.740 --> 00:26:32.300]   He's like, "Man, you know, it's just kind of crazy.
[00:26:32.300 --> 00:26:33.940]   I don't even know other people struggle with this."
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:34.940]   And then it's like, "What is it?"
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:36.820]   And it's like, "Man, we had this fight."
[00:26:36.820 --> 00:26:37.820]   I'm like, "Other people fight."
[00:26:37.820 --> 00:26:40.060]   And he's like, "We fought about..."
[00:26:40.060 --> 00:26:41.060]   And then it goes on.
[00:26:41.060 --> 00:26:46.140]   It's like, sometimes the girl just feels like she's not considered and not cared for.
[00:26:46.140 --> 00:26:47.660]   The guy feels like, "I am."
[00:26:47.660 --> 00:26:48.660]   And, "How come you're doing this?"
[00:26:48.660 --> 00:26:49.660]   And then they fight.
[00:26:49.660 --> 00:26:50.660]   And then it escalates.
[00:26:50.660 --> 00:26:53.140]   And then they get into this and they threaten breakup.
[00:26:53.140 --> 00:26:55.580]   And they're like, "I don't know what to do."
[00:26:55.580 --> 00:26:58.780]   And I'm sitting there looking at them and I'm like, "Well, let me guess.
[00:26:58.780 --> 00:26:59.780]   You said this."
[00:26:59.780 --> 00:27:00.780]   And he's like, "Oh yeah, I did."
[00:27:00.780 --> 00:27:01.780]   And she said this.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:02.780]   And he's like, "Oh yeah."
[00:27:02.780 --> 00:27:03.780]   And I said this.
[00:27:03.780 --> 00:27:04.780]   And he's like, "Whoa, how do you know?"
[00:27:04.780 --> 00:27:05.780]   Because I'm a guru.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:12.760]   But the thing is, categorically, you can sometimes do that because, yeah, we're the same people
[00:27:12.760 --> 00:27:17.180]   and we go through a lot of the same life experiences.
[00:27:17.180 --> 00:27:19.040]   But sometimes we do that too much.
[00:27:19.040 --> 00:27:20.420]   And then we assume we know.
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:22.860]   So there are other times where I'm like, "Let me guess.
[00:27:22.860 --> 00:27:23.860]   You said something stupid."
[00:27:23.860 --> 00:27:24.860]   And then she said this.
[00:27:24.860 --> 00:27:25.860]   And he's like, "No.
[00:27:25.860 --> 00:27:28.500]   Why do you think I always say something stupid?"
[00:27:28.500 --> 00:27:31.500]   And it's like, "Oh shoot.
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:32.500]   Okay, fine.
[00:27:32.500 --> 00:27:34.060]   Why don't you tell me what you said?"
[00:27:34.060 --> 00:27:41.340]   And you realize, if you're going to help, assuming always is bad.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:46.060]   I have to, even if I've asked the same question to a thousand people, I have to ask questions
[00:27:46.060 --> 00:27:47.060]   to that person.
[00:27:47.060 --> 00:27:48.060]   Why?
[00:27:48.060 --> 00:27:51.500]   Because that person is a different person, perhaps in the same similar context, but it's
[00:27:51.500 --> 00:27:52.500]   him.
[00:27:52.500 --> 00:27:55.240]   And I have to understand him.
[00:27:55.240 --> 00:27:56.240]   What are your thoughts?
[00:27:56.240 --> 00:27:57.240]   What do you think?
[00:27:57.240 --> 00:27:58.240]   How did you respond?
[00:27:58.240 --> 00:28:01.260]   And if I don't know that, I can't help him.
[00:28:01.260 --> 00:28:02.260]   So pause, so pause.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:03.260]   And I'm like, "Look at these people.
[00:28:03.260 --> 00:28:05.020]   They're weak."
[00:28:05.020 --> 00:28:07.420]   And in that circumstance, there's different types of people who are weak.
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.300]   They're the people who are sitting there who are weak because, "I don't know what to do.
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.740]   I don't even know what to think about this.
[00:28:12.740 --> 00:28:13.740]   Is this right?
[00:28:13.740 --> 00:28:14.740]   Is it wrong?
[00:28:14.740 --> 00:28:18.580]   It's meek, but they're sacrificing and all these people."
[00:28:18.580 --> 00:28:19.580]   And they need instruction.
[00:28:19.580 --> 00:28:23.300]   But do you realize in this scenario, there's other people?
[00:28:23.300 --> 00:28:26.180]   There are people who are weak because they don't know what to do, but there are people
[00:28:26.180 --> 00:28:29.540]   who are weak because they know what to do, but they have a hard time doing it.
[00:28:29.540 --> 00:28:32.740]   Do you notice that in that past, there's the person who is weak?
[00:28:32.740 --> 00:28:35.320]   It's not the person who just doesn't know what to do.
[00:28:35.320 --> 00:28:38.080]   He knows it's wrong or he thinks it's wrong.
[00:28:38.080 --> 00:28:40.980]   He thinks in his mind, "This is compromise to God."
[00:28:40.980 --> 00:28:41.980]   But there's social pressure.
[00:28:41.980 --> 00:28:42.980]   He's at a wedding.
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:43.980]   He's going to look bad.
[00:28:43.980 --> 00:28:44.980]   What is he going to do?
[00:28:44.980 --> 00:28:45.980]   What is he going to say?
[00:28:45.980 --> 00:28:46.980]   He doesn't have other food.
[00:28:46.980 --> 00:28:47.980]   He should just eat it.
[00:28:47.980 --> 00:28:49.480]   So he says, "Oh, maybe I'll just eat it and no one will know."
[00:28:49.480 --> 00:28:50.960]   And then he defiles his conscience.
[00:28:50.960 --> 00:28:52.540]   He's going against his what?
[00:28:52.540 --> 00:28:54.540]   Belief system.
[00:28:54.540 --> 00:28:56.900]   That is a different kind of person that needs a different kind of advice.
[00:28:56.900 --> 00:29:00.880]   That is a different kind of person that needs something else.
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:05.980]   But we tend to judge that in just one lump category and be like, "Bah, you're just weak."
[00:29:05.980 --> 00:29:10.240]   That's the kind of attitude Apostle Paul is attacking in this first three verses.
[00:29:10.240 --> 00:29:15.580]   You think you know, but you don't really know as you should.
[00:29:15.580 --> 00:29:18.500]   You think you know and you judge so quickly.
[00:29:18.500 --> 00:29:20.820]   Do you ever judge people and their intentions so quickly?
[00:29:20.820 --> 00:29:22.660]   Like, "Gah, you're just weak."
[00:29:22.660 --> 00:29:26.040]   Are these people actually weak?
[00:29:26.040 --> 00:29:28.380]   They're trying to do what's right.
[00:29:28.380 --> 00:29:32.780]   You're trying to decide, "Is this right for me to do?"
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:36.460]   I actually don't think the people who are weak are actually that weak when their heart
[00:29:36.460 --> 00:29:40.080]   intent is, "I don't want to compromise my faith."
[00:29:40.080 --> 00:29:46.980]   But these other people, "But if you go against my meat eating, you're weak."
[00:29:46.980 --> 00:29:51.500]   There's an attitude of arrogance that Apostle Paul is attacking and we need to realize that.
[00:29:51.500 --> 00:29:54.580]   And we need to admit our ignorance.
[00:29:54.580 --> 00:29:58.620]   But second, we need to seek to understand people.
[00:29:58.620 --> 00:30:00.460]   Be people who ask good questions.
[00:30:00.460 --> 00:30:02.500]   Be people who listen and understand.
[00:30:02.500 --> 00:30:09.380]   Be people who appropriately speak truth in love.
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:12.980]   Before you ever give advice, before you ever speak, and before you ever say, "This is what
[00:30:12.980 --> 00:30:16.580]   it is," make sure you understand.
[00:30:16.580 --> 00:30:20.580]   Otherwise there's a huge danger, isn't there?
[00:30:20.580 --> 00:30:24.160]   There is a huge danger of being completely useless.
[00:30:24.160 --> 00:30:26.780]   Remember 1 Corinthians chapter 13?
[00:30:26.780 --> 00:30:29.940]   You've got all this head knowledge, you're a teacher, you go preaching but you have not
[00:30:29.940 --> 00:30:30.940]   love, then you're what?
[00:30:30.940 --> 00:30:31.940]   You're useless.
[00:30:31.940 --> 00:30:34.340]   You speak in tongues, you do all this stuff, what are you?
[00:30:34.340 --> 00:30:36.740]   You're just noise if you don't have love.
[00:30:36.740 --> 00:30:39.740]   You run the risk of being absolutely useless.
[00:30:39.740 --> 00:30:43.940]   But also you run the risk of being hurtful to the relationship and the relationship in
[00:30:43.940 --> 00:30:44.940]   the church.
[00:30:44.940 --> 00:30:47.160]   Have you ever thought about this?
[00:30:47.160 --> 00:30:53.580]   If you speak without understanding, you actually not only are not helpful, you become destructive.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:02.980]   You know, sometimes I don't like to use these examples of my kids but they're so good examples.
[00:31:02.980 --> 00:31:07.660]   My son is really developing and he's becoming really good at Legos.
[00:31:07.660 --> 00:31:09.060]   And I'm really impressed.
[00:31:09.060 --> 00:31:10.380]   He can put together little Legos.
[00:31:10.380 --> 00:31:13.580]   You know the ones that, like I got fat, shabby fingers so I can't even do it, you know?
[00:31:13.580 --> 00:31:16.940]   It's just like, I start doing it and it gets really frustrating, I'm like, "Gah, I can't
[00:31:16.940 --> 00:31:17.940]   do this," you know?
[00:31:17.940 --> 00:31:20.300]   Like, "I'm not physically meant for this."
[00:31:20.300 --> 00:31:22.580]   He's got these nimble little hands and he's doing all this stuff.
[00:31:22.580 --> 00:31:26.100]   I can actually give him a Lego instruction booklet.
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:28.060]   He'll flip through the pages and make it.
[00:31:28.060 --> 00:31:29.780]   I'm like, "Dang," you know?
[00:31:29.780 --> 00:31:32.620]   And then sometimes he'll invite me over and be like, "Appa, look what I made."
[00:31:32.620 --> 00:31:33.620]   I'm like, "That's awesome."
[00:31:33.620 --> 00:31:35.900]   And he'll say, "Come over and make it with me."
[00:31:35.900 --> 00:31:39.820]   And sure enough, I go over and I'm making it with him and obviously, he's four, okay?
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:42.420]   If you guys don't know, my son is four, right?
[00:31:42.420 --> 00:31:45.300]   So he's four and he's doing the Lego stuff and I'm impressed.
[00:31:45.300 --> 00:31:48.780]   But then obviously there's times when it's like, he does a fat piece, he's looking at
[00:31:48.780 --> 00:31:50.340]   the picture and he's just like, "Bleh."
[00:31:50.340 --> 00:31:55.500]   He doesn't know where to put it so he's just like jabbing it into somewhere, you know?
[00:31:55.500 --> 00:31:57.620]   And I'll reach over and I'll try to grab him.
[00:31:57.620 --> 00:32:01.780]   So if you look at the picture and then what you do is, and then before I finish my sentence,
[00:32:01.780 --> 00:32:03.860]   like, "I know, Appa, I know."
[00:32:03.860 --> 00:32:04.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:32:04.860 --> 00:32:07.140]   It's like, "Whoa," okay?
[00:32:07.140 --> 00:32:12.100]   Now, so that's the example of the people earlier I mentioned who claim to know everything.
[00:32:12.100 --> 00:32:14.980]   You're like, "Ahh," you know?
[00:32:14.980 --> 00:32:16.900]   And I'm like, "Look at this instruction.
[00:32:16.900 --> 00:32:17.900]   Do you see what's there?"
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:19.420]   He's like, "No, Appa, I'll do it."
[00:32:19.420 --> 00:32:20.420]   You know?
[00:32:20.420 --> 00:32:25.220]   Okay, so what happens is when I get to the point of not loving him but I'm like, "No,
[00:32:25.220 --> 00:32:26.860]   this is how you do the Lego, okay?"
[00:32:26.860 --> 00:32:31.020]   And I start getting in his face, I'm like, "This is how you do Lego," right?
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:34.860]   Tell me, is that constructive or destructive?
[00:32:34.860 --> 00:32:37.540]   That's destructive, right?
[00:32:37.540 --> 00:32:41.060]   And not only that, but like, there's this childish, like, rage that comes inside of
[00:32:41.060 --> 00:32:42.860]   me because he's like, "No, Appa, I'll do it."
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:43.860]   I'm like, "Oh yeah?"
[00:32:43.860 --> 00:32:47.180]   And I just want to like, like, blow it up, you know?
[00:32:47.180 --> 00:32:50.540]   Like, "Try to do it now," and then like ruin all his Legos.
[00:32:50.540 --> 00:32:51.540]   You know?
[00:32:51.540 --> 00:32:52.540]   Yeah, it's really bad.
[00:32:52.540 --> 00:32:59.420]   And I have to step away, it's like, "It's just Legos, it's just Legos."
[00:32:59.420 --> 00:33:05.700]   But my point is, if you don't understand the child, but you're so insistent, "But this
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:06.700]   is right.
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:08.260]   Apostle Paul, this is right."
[00:33:08.260 --> 00:33:14.860]   And you don't realize you have to speak truth in context and with people, what happens?
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:15.860]   You start getting destructive.
[00:33:15.860 --> 00:33:18.500]   Yeah.
[00:33:18.500 --> 00:33:24.060]   And that's the point I'm making is that Apostle Paul here, he hasn't really even like told
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:30.220]   them what to do yet, but only to challenge their attitude and challenge their perspective
[00:33:30.220 --> 00:33:34.380]   and say, "I want you to make decisions about what to do here, but first, submit your ignorance.
[00:33:34.380 --> 00:33:37.380]   Second, seek to understand the people," right?
[00:33:37.380 --> 00:33:39.980]   So that you can love them.
[00:33:39.980 --> 00:33:46.980]   And then third, as we move on, this is the main point of the sermon really, is to end
[00:33:46.980 --> 00:33:50.160]   all your efforts in love.
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:52.680]   End all your efforts in love.
[00:33:52.680 --> 00:33:56.300]   There is an important facet of what they're doing in their context, which is they have
[00:33:56.300 --> 00:34:01.000]   to maintain the unity of the church, the body of Christ.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:06.660]   And this was really confusing to me, but if you look at verse three, it reads funny.
[00:34:06.660 --> 00:34:09.740]   But if anyone loves God, he is known by him.
[00:34:09.740 --> 00:34:10.740]   Okay?
[00:34:10.740 --> 00:34:11.860]   So take a look at verse two.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:15.500]   It's like if anyone supposes he knows anything, he doesn't know nothing yet.
[00:34:15.500 --> 00:34:16.500]   Okay?
[00:34:16.500 --> 00:34:19.540]   You claim you have knowledge, but you don't really know.
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.740]   But if you love God, you're known by him.
[00:34:21.740 --> 00:34:24.740]   So I was like, "What?"
[00:34:24.740 --> 00:34:25.980]   So one is knowledge.
[00:34:25.980 --> 00:34:29.280]   If you claim to have knowledge and you're all arrogant, that's bad.
[00:34:29.280 --> 00:34:34.180]   So contrast that with you got to love God and then God knows you.
[00:34:34.180 --> 00:34:36.540]   It all just reads, does it read funny to you a little bit?
[00:34:36.540 --> 00:34:40.980]   It should sound more like, you know, if you claim to have knowledge, you're all wrong.
[00:34:40.980 --> 00:34:44.460]   You should love God and then you should seek to know God and you're going to know God if
[00:34:44.460 --> 00:34:47.260]   you love God or something like that, you know?
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:49.900]   But I think there's this aspect that there's a gospel truth in here.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:51.900]   I think there's an aspect of our humility in here.
[00:34:51.900 --> 00:34:54.780]   There's an aspect of the relationship that we have with God.
[00:34:54.780 --> 00:35:01.420]   That what's more important here is not like just the factual knowledge of God, but the
[00:35:01.420 --> 00:35:04.260]   relational aspect of knowing one another.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:07.140]   You see what I'm saying here?
[00:35:07.140 --> 00:35:09.860]   Because enemies of God know God is powerful.
[00:35:09.860 --> 00:35:11.740]   Satan knows God is powerful.
[00:35:11.740 --> 00:35:13.900]   Satan knows God has a church.
[00:35:13.900 --> 00:35:15.500]   Satan knows a lot about God.
[00:35:15.500 --> 00:35:17.300]   Satan knows God loves us.
[00:35:17.300 --> 00:35:20.620]   Satan knows he loves Jesus Christ.
[00:35:20.620 --> 00:35:23.460]   Satan knows facts about God.
[00:35:23.460 --> 00:35:30.780]   Satan does not know God in the way that he's using and God knows you, right?
[00:35:30.780 --> 00:35:38.220]   When it says here that God knows you, there's an element of Apostle Paul humbling them.
[00:35:38.220 --> 00:35:42.500]   Apostle Paul might be looking at them like, "So do they frustrate you?"
[00:35:42.500 --> 00:35:45.100]   It's like, "Yes, they're really frustrating.
[00:35:45.100 --> 00:35:47.180]   I love me, you know?
[00:35:47.180 --> 00:35:49.220]   We go to all you can eat buffets."
[00:35:49.220 --> 00:35:50.460]   They don't go to all you can eat buffets.
[00:35:50.460 --> 00:35:53.420]   That's a modern day phenomenon, okay?
[00:35:53.420 --> 00:35:54.420]   Anyway.
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.620]   "Yes, you know?
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:35:58.700]   We're frustrated."
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:03.860]   And then he kind of brings this idea of God knows you, you know?
[00:36:03.860 --> 00:36:06.300]   Are you not frustrating?
[00:36:06.300 --> 00:36:08.500]   Is your knowledge really that complete?
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:11.380]   But God knows you, right?
[00:36:11.380 --> 00:36:15.340]   And he talks about this love relationship with God that needs to be maintained in this
[00:36:15.340 --> 00:36:18.660]   whole endeavor of trying to rectify one situation.
[00:36:18.660 --> 00:36:24.420]   And I think there's a sense in which for the people, they need to understand this too.
[00:36:24.420 --> 00:36:32.540]   That their knowledge by itself is so insufficient to make a decision of what's right, you know?
[00:36:32.540 --> 00:36:35.100]   They can't just come into a scenario, "Let me evaluate.
[00:36:35.100 --> 00:36:36.460]   Is A, B, C?
[00:36:36.460 --> 00:36:39.040]   Okay, then we do D."
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:41.420]   You can't do that.
[00:36:41.420 --> 00:36:46.300]   Because applied in the circumstance, they need to understand not just the facts, but
[00:36:46.300 --> 00:36:47.300]   they need to know the people.
[00:36:47.300 --> 00:36:48.540]   They need to understand their context.
[00:36:48.540 --> 00:36:50.380]   They need to see what's best.
[00:36:50.380 --> 00:36:53.680]   Is this in love?
[00:36:53.680 --> 00:36:54.680]   So you know what?
[00:36:54.680 --> 00:36:59.500]   There's going to be a scenario in your life, "Should I do this or should I do this?"
[00:36:59.500 --> 00:37:02.180]   Now option A, it's going to be comfortable for you.
[00:37:02.180 --> 00:37:03.980]   Option B, it's going to be hard for you.
[00:37:03.980 --> 00:37:08.300]   Option B might even entail sacrifice.
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:11.260]   But it isn't in love.
[00:37:11.260 --> 00:37:16.220]   Then sometimes a lot of that knowledge, a lot of that factual accounting knowledge,
[00:37:16.220 --> 00:37:18.500]   it goes out the window.
[00:37:18.500 --> 00:37:20.260]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:37:20.260 --> 00:37:22.900]   So that's, I think that's kind of what he's pointing at here.
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:29.540]   And the reason why I'm saying this is because even your knowledge, again, knowledge is crucial,
[00:37:29.540 --> 00:37:32.620]   it's necessary, it's foundational, it's insufficient.
[00:37:32.620 --> 00:37:35.540]   It's insufficient to do what's right in this scenario.
[00:37:35.540 --> 00:37:38.420]   You need to have love, a love that's seeking to edify.
[00:37:38.420 --> 00:37:39.500]   So what am I saying?
[00:37:39.500 --> 00:37:43.780]   Even your knowledge, your truth, it needs to be spoken in love, meaning it needs to
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.820]   be conditioned by love.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:46.820]   Why is that important?
[00:37:46.820 --> 00:37:49.860]   Because in this context, they have to deal with their liberty.
[00:37:49.860 --> 00:37:51.420]   I have a liberty to eat meat.
[00:37:51.420 --> 00:37:55.180]   I have a liberty to do what I want to do with my life.
[00:37:55.180 --> 00:37:59.820]   But the thing about it is, that's not noble.
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:03.820]   Even your liberty has to be conditioned by love.
[00:38:03.820 --> 00:38:05.540]   Right?
[00:38:05.540 --> 00:38:10.060]   The freedom that you have, it has to exist in the context of love.
[00:38:10.060 --> 00:38:16.540]   What you exercise, the things that is obligated and right to you, it has to be, as a Christian,
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:22.300]   as a follower of Christ, modeled and emulated after that of Christ.
[00:38:22.300 --> 00:38:27.420]   What right did Christ say, "That's my right, so I'm not going to do it."
[00:38:27.420 --> 00:38:29.740]   You know what the scripture says?
[00:38:29.740 --> 00:38:33.380]   Do you know what the scripture says about Christ?
[00:38:33.380 --> 00:38:38.060]   What God, what Christ had in equality with God.
[00:38:38.060 --> 00:38:44.860]   His divine nature, his authority, he did not consider it as something to be grasped.
[00:38:44.860 --> 00:38:49.020]   I'm not letting go of this, because it's mine.
[00:38:49.020 --> 00:38:51.220]   That's not our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:38:51.220 --> 00:38:54.300]   This is my liberty, this is my right.
[00:38:54.300 --> 00:38:57.340]   That's not our forefathers, and that's not apostle Paul.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:58.340]   Look at chapter 9, verse 1.
[00:38:58.340 --> 00:38:59.340]   "Am I not free?
[00:38:59.340 --> 00:39:00.860]   Am I not an apostle?
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.580]   Have I not seen Jesus the Lord?
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.180]   Are you not my work and the Lord?"
[00:39:05.180 --> 00:39:06.780]   You see what he's getting at?
[00:39:06.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   Don't I have the right?
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:10.460]   I'm free, just like you're free.
[00:39:10.460 --> 00:39:12.300]   Not only that, but I'm a worker above you.
[00:39:12.300 --> 00:39:13.300]   I'm an apostle.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:14.300]   I've seen Christ.
[00:39:14.300 --> 00:39:15.660]   I'm a messenger of the Lord.
[00:39:15.660 --> 00:39:17.780]   I've been handpicked by God.
[00:39:17.780 --> 00:39:20.980]   But look at the stuff he says later.
[00:39:20.980 --> 00:39:23.660]   Go to chapter 10, verse 23.
[00:39:23.660 --> 00:39:24.660]   Chapter 10, verse 23.
[00:39:24.660 --> 00:39:27.420]   "All things are lawful, but not all things are profitable.
[00:39:27.420 --> 00:39:31.780]   All things are lawful, but not all things edify.
[00:39:31.780 --> 00:39:35.540]   Let no one seek his own good, but that of his neighbor."
[00:39:35.540 --> 00:39:37.860]   Look at chapter, verse 31.
[00:39:37.860 --> 00:39:42.140]   "Whether then you eat or drink or whatever you do, do all for the glory of God.
[00:39:42.140 --> 00:39:46.940]   Give no offense either to Jews or to Greeks or to the church of God, just as I also please
[00:39:46.940 --> 00:39:52.300]   all men in all things, not seeking my own profit, but the profit of the many, so that
[00:39:52.300 --> 00:39:53.380]   they may be saved."
[00:39:53.380 --> 00:39:56.820]   Wow, what a challenge.
[00:39:56.820 --> 00:39:59.260]   That's crazy stuff.
[00:39:59.260 --> 00:40:04.060]   You think about what he's saying there, and that is crazy challenge.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:10.380]   Now, there is a place for direct confrontation, direct speech, rebuking somebody, exhorting
[00:40:10.380 --> 00:40:11.380]   somebody.
[00:40:11.380 --> 00:40:17.900]   There's another place for saying, "Hey, here's the truth," and bam, you need to do it.
[00:40:17.900 --> 00:40:21.940]   But the fact of the matter is, you see what he's saying here.
[00:40:21.940 --> 00:40:30.700]   In love, we are not to define strength like, "I am who I am.
[00:40:30.700 --> 00:40:35.980]   That's who I'm going to be, and everybody just has to deal with it."
[00:40:35.980 --> 00:40:38.740]   That's not strength.
[00:40:38.740 --> 00:40:42.540]   The kind of strength Apostle Paul is seeking here is also not strength of intellect and
[00:40:42.540 --> 00:40:44.980]   knowledge where like some of us do, right?
[00:40:44.980 --> 00:40:46.940]   Somebody has a question, "Here's the truth."
[00:40:46.940 --> 00:40:49.380]   So you have a conflict, "Well, I know better."
[00:40:49.380 --> 00:40:50.380]   There it is.
[00:40:50.380 --> 00:40:51.380]   Don't you know?
[00:40:51.380 --> 00:40:57.700]   The kind of strength he's asking for here is the kind of strength that enables you to
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:40:59.980]   be all things to all men.
[00:40:59.980 --> 00:41:04.620]   The kind of strength that presses the degree to which you will sacrifice.
[00:41:04.620 --> 00:41:08.620]   I mean, seriously, if you guys know me, I love food, and I've confessed this sometimes
[00:41:08.620 --> 00:41:13.540]   that when I'm stressed, I'm like a stress eater even, and it makes me happy.
[00:41:13.540 --> 00:41:17.580]   It's just one of those things that's hard for me to give up, to give up food.
[00:41:17.580 --> 00:41:22.260]   But for Apostle Paul to say, "Even if it's meat, I will never eat meat again," that's
[00:41:22.260 --> 00:41:29.100]   a degree of showing to what extent will I go to love you.
[00:41:29.100 --> 00:41:32.060]   So let's be wise.
[00:41:32.060 --> 00:41:35.500]   In our decision-making process, we can be caught up with, "Is this profitable for me?
[00:41:35.500 --> 00:41:36.860]   Is this right?
[00:41:36.860 --> 00:41:38.140]   Is this good?
[00:41:38.140 --> 00:41:39.140]   Is this controlling?
[00:41:39.140 --> 00:41:40.140]   Is it not?
[00:41:40.140 --> 00:41:41.140]   Is it excess for me?
[00:41:41.140 --> 00:41:42.880]   Is it not excess for me?"
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:46.960]   But there is another question Apostle Paul is challenging the church.
[00:41:46.960 --> 00:41:48.920]   Is this loving?
[00:41:48.920 --> 00:41:53.220]   And your standard and your limit to which you've set, "I'm willing to go that far."
[00:41:53.220 --> 00:41:55.360]   Let's challenge that.
[00:41:55.360 --> 00:41:58.500]   To what degree are we willing to go?
[00:41:58.500 --> 00:42:00.380]   What a great example for us.
[00:42:00.380 --> 00:42:01.580]   We'll complete on the next time.
[00:42:01.580 --> 00:42:08.580]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:42:08.580 --> 00:42:11.780]   Father God, we thank you so much.
[00:42:11.780 --> 00:42:13.140]   We thank you, God.
[00:42:13.140 --> 00:42:19.500]   Lord, so many times we act like we know, but we know that we know so little.
[00:42:19.500 --> 00:42:23.140]   God, thank you that you did not leave us in our ignorance.
[00:42:23.140 --> 00:42:26.580]   Thank you that you did not leave us to our own destructive devices.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.500]   But God, you reason with us.
[00:42:28.500 --> 00:42:29.500]   You give us truth.
[00:42:29.500 --> 00:42:30.500]   You give us example.
[00:42:30.500 --> 00:42:38.060]   And in Christ, you show us the ultimate example of one who is willing to go at length to seek
[00:42:38.060 --> 00:42:40.740]   the love and benefit of the brethren.
[00:42:40.740 --> 00:42:42.820]   We thank you so much, Lord.
[00:42:42.820 --> 00:42:45.140]   I pray, Father God, that we be all challenged today.
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:48.100]   If we have arrogance in our heart, deal with that, Lord.
[00:42:48.100 --> 00:42:49.760]   Convict us to the Spirit.
[00:42:49.760 --> 00:42:54.100]   If we have a habit of acting like we know, speaking first before we understand, help
[00:42:54.100 --> 00:42:55.500]   us to change that.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.780]   God, help us in our week really to practice love.
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:01.860]   To practice the kind of love that you have shown us.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:03.860]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ and we pray.
[00:43:03.860 --> 00:43:04.220]   Amen.
