[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.640]   One particular day, I had a paper due and it took me all night and probably half the
[00:00:08.640 --> 00:00:11.800]   next day finishing up this paper and I was almost done.
[00:00:11.800 --> 00:00:16.260]   And as I was leaving the room, I flipped the switch, turned the light off, and as I turned
[00:00:16.260 --> 00:00:19.360]   the light off, I realized the computer turned off.
[00:00:19.360 --> 00:00:24.080]   And in a split second, I realized the computer was, you know, plugged into that one plug
[00:00:24.080 --> 00:00:27.040]   where it turns the light on and off and not realizing that.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.640]   And again, you know, we're brand new to the computer world and so after it turned off,
[00:00:31.640 --> 00:00:33.200]   I was like, oh, shoot.
[00:00:33.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   Does that mean that everything I did was turned off?
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.760]   Like, you know, it's not like computers today.
[00:00:36.760 --> 00:00:38.400]   It doesn't automatically save.
[00:00:38.400 --> 00:00:41.480]   So I went back on and I tried to retrieve everything that I did and obviously it was
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480]   completely wiped out.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:43.800]   It was gone.
[00:00:43.800 --> 00:00:48.640]   And I called whoever, you know, knew anything about computers and they said, no, if you
[00:00:48.640 --> 00:00:53.320]   didn't save it on the floppy disk, so some of you guys may remember the floppy disk,
[00:00:53.320 --> 00:00:56.160]   you know, if you didn't save it on that, you can't retrieve it.
[00:00:56.160 --> 00:01:03.320]   And then I remember after that, I was so traumatized by this computer that I never used it again.
[00:01:03.320 --> 00:01:07.120]   And it wasn't until, I mean, maybe our third or fourth year in seminary that I started
[00:01:07.120 --> 00:01:10.760]   using the Mac, you know, because the school offered it and I started using that.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.840]   But ever since then, I have this fear that if I touch something wrong, I'm not really
[00:01:15.840 --> 00:01:19.920]   afraid of the hardware, I'm more afraid of the software, that I might go in somewhere
[00:01:19.920 --> 00:01:23.680]   and delete something and that's going to ruin the whole computer, you know, and everything
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:26.680]   that I've saved on there, I'll never be able to retrieve again.
[00:01:26.680 --> 00:01:31.360]   I become a little bit better than that, but not a whole lot because I have fear of touching
[00:01:31.360 --> 00:01:33.760]   this machine, you know?
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:38.800]   And I'm not bad with, like, machinery, like, something I can touch with my bare hands,
[00:01:38.800 --> 00:01:43.080]   but when it comes to computer, for some reason I have this fear, so I just don't like touching
[00:01:43.080 --> 00:01:44.080]   it.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.760]   There's plenty of people who are good at it and I just let them handle it.
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:51.440]   Same thing happened with me with GPS.
[00:01:51.440 --> 00:01:56.920]   Years ago when GPS first came out, I was in Chicago and I had a rental car, and this must
[00:01:56.920 --> 00:02:01.840]   have been about 16, 17 years ago, and we were headed toward Urbana.
[00:02:01.840 --> 00:02:06.080]   I think there's a few of you guys who were with us and they gave us a GPS to use and
[00:02:06.080 --> 00:02:09.840]   I remember that GPS took us to the wrong place and we were lost maybe about three or four
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:13.320]   hours and then I realized that GPS didn't work properly.
[00:02:13.320 --> 00:02:16.960]   It told us to go somewhere that we weren't supposed to go and I never touched GPS again
[00:02:16.960 --> 00:02:20.760]   for the next 10 years because, like, how do you trust this thing, right?
[00:02:20.760 --> 00:02:21.760]   I don't know where I'm going.
[00:02:21.760 --> 00:02:23.920]   It might tell me to make a left turn or right turn.
[00:02:23.920 --> 00:02:28.880]   So I think every single one of us can relate to have poured your energy into something
[00:02:28.880 --> 00:02:32.960]   and at the end of the day found out that it was completely useless, whether it was a term
[00:02:32.960 --> 00:02:37.720]   paper or maybe you went north when you should have went south, you know, and then all of
[00:02:37.720 --> 00:02:41.320]   a sudden there's a sign saying, "Welcome to Big Bear," and realize that you're not in
[00:02:41.320 --> 00:02:43.060]   Orange County.
[00:02:43.060 --> 00:02:47.020]   How you feel, that overwhelming feeling of you've wasted your time.
[00:02:47.020 --> 00:02:50.920]   Why did I do this?
[00:02:50.920 --> 00:02:58.860]   The gospel that Apostle Paul has been preaching probably struck the Jews, again, in a much
[00:02:58.860 --> 00:03:03.940]   exaggerated way, but in a similar way, at least emotionally, the way that I felt when
[00:03:03.940 --> 00:03:07.460]   I turned off that computer or maybe when you felt when you got lost for a long period of
[00:03:07.460 --> 00:03:12.820]   time and you didn't recognize it and realize you've been going the wrong direction.
[00:03:12.820 --> 00:03:19.020]   Apostle Paul is trying to preach salvation by grace, justification by faith alone to
[00:03:19.020 --> 00:03:24.820]   a group of people who devoted their lives to obeying the law.
[00:03:24.820 --> 00:03:31.060]   So Paul's gospel wasn't simply saying, "Hey, what you were doing in the temple was wrong."
[00:03:31.060 --> 00:03:34.360]   He wasn't simply saying the sacrifice that you were giving wasn't sufficient.
[00:03:34.360 --> 00:03:37.180]   You have to give this kind of sacrifice.
[00:03:37.180 --> 00:03:41.960]   The message that Paul was giving basically says that everything that you were thinking
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.540]   about your righteousness was completely wrong.
[00:03:45.540 --> 00:03:49.360]   That you've been going the wrong direction and you've been doing it fervently with all
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:52.940]   kinds of passion and you were wrong.
[00:03:52.940 --> 00:03:59.260]   So Paul has been preaching salvation by grace, justification by faith up to chapter 8 and
[00:03:59.260 --> 00:04:04.500]   we've been studying, again, jumping into chapter 9, and so they're trying to answer this question,
[00:04:04.500 --> 00:04:09.040]   how can this gospel that you're preaching be fair?
[00:04:09.040 --> 00:04:13.200]   So the easy way to nullify the gospel is to nullify the messenger.
[00:04:13.200 --> 00:04:19.160]   So Paul has been arguing the fairness of the gospel, of righteousness that can only be
[00:04:19.160 --> 00:04:20.160]   found in Christ.
[00:04:20.160 --> 00:04:26.200]   And so chapter 9, if you remember, he begins by conveying, "It has nothing to do with my
[00:04:26.200 --> 00:04:27.200]   prejudice.
[00:04:27.200 --> 00:04:33.600]   In fact, if it had any power, I wish that I could be a curse for my countrymen."
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:38.000]   And so he's been arguing in chapter 9 the fairness of the gospel, the sovereignty of
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   God.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:45.520]   Chapter 10 is part 2 of his argument and he begins in a similar manner, chapter 10, verse
[00:04:45.520 --> 00:04:49.600]   1, he says, "Brothers, my heart's desire and prayer to God for them is that they may be
[00:04:49.600 --> 00:04:50.600]   saved."
[00:04:50.600 --> 00:04:53.600]   Now these aren't just empty words.
[00:04:53.600 --> 00:04:55.760]   Apostle Paul really loved his country.
[00:04:55.760 --> 00:04:57.760]   He loved his countrymen.
[00:04:58.320 --> 00:05:04.720]   Now, again, you and I live in a culture, in a part of the world where individualism is
[00:05:04.720 --> 00:05:08.040]   elevated much higher than nationalism.
[00:05:08.040 --> 00:05:09.040]   That's what we value.
[00:05:09.040 --> 00:05:12.640]   Americans are known for being individualistic.
[00:05:12.640 --> 00:05:17.560]   But if you grew up or if you know anything about other countries where nationalism takes
[00:05:17.560 --> 00:05:24.640]   center stage, above your family, above your personal freedom, again, if you understood
[00:05:24.640 --> 00:05:27.920]   that you would understand Apostle Paul's heart.
[00:05:27.920 --> 00:05:31.560]   Nationalism for the nation of Israel was at the core of the nation.
[00:05:31.560 --> 00:05:33.560]   That's what they were taught from generation to generation.
[00:05:33.560 --> 00:05:38.980]   In fact, Paul is called specifically as an apostle to the Gentiles.
[00:05:38.980 --> 00:05:43.960]   But if you look at his ministry, every city that he goes into, where's the first place
[00:05:43.960 --> 00:05:47.000]   that he goes to preach the gospel?
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:48.080]   Almost always the synagogue.
[00:05:48.080 --> 00:05:52.440]   The only reason why he doesn't go to a synagogue is because they don't have one.
[00:05:52.440 --> 00:05:56.760]   And the reason why he ends up preaching outside of the synagogue is because he gets persecuted
[00:05:56.760 --> 00:05:58.360]   and kicked out.
[00:05:58.360 --> 00:06:03.040]   And so as a result of that, he would go to the marketplace and begin to preach the gospel.
[00:06:03.040 --> 00:06:08.560]   So you could see that Apostle Paul was not simply desiring and just praying and wishful
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:09.560]   thinking.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:14.160]   He actually did his best to bring the gospel to the Jews.
[00:06:14.160 --> 00:06:19.520]   But as a result of his failure or their rejection, he would end up going preaching the gospel
[00:06:19.520 --> 00:06:22.240]   to the Gentile world.
[00:06:22.240 --> 00:06:30.080]   Generally speaking, what God called Paul to do is absolutely impossible.
[00:06:30.080 --> 00:06:32.560]   Absolutely impossible.
[00:06:32.560 --> 00:06:39.520]   Can you imagine somebody coming up and saying, "You know, your hairstyle is wrong.
[00:06:39.520 --> 00:06:42.300]   The school that you went to, it's wrong.
[00:06:42.300 --> 00:06:43.960]   The job that you got, it's wrong."
[00:06:43.960 --> 00:06:45.840]   It goes further than that.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:49.960]   "The husband, your wife, that you chose, it's wrong.
[00:06:49.960 --> 00:06:52.520]   The money, the way you spend your money, it's wrong.
[00:06:52.520 --> 00:06:55.240]   What you think is right and wrong is wrong.
[00:06:55.240 --> 00:06:58.240]   Your hope, the way you're raising your children, it's wrong.
[00:06:58.240 --> 00:06:59.900]   Your speech pattern is wrong.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:02.140]   Everything about you is wrong."
[00:07:02.140 --> 00:07:05.820]   That's exactly how the Jews probably heard it.
[00:07:05.820 --> 00:07:08.800]   He wasn't just talking about a certain aspect of their life.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:13.640]   He was saying that everything that they valued, all their energy that they poured into was
[00:07:13.640 --> 00:07:16.960]   absolutely wrong.
[00:07:16.960 --> 00:07:21.920]   Humanly speaking, the task that Paul has to preach the gospel was impossible.
[00:07:21.920 --> 00:07:25.280]   It wasn't just hard, it's impossible.
[00:07:25.280 --> 00:07:30.400]   So we can understand why they had such a hard time receiving, humanly speaking, why they
[00:07:30.400 --> 00:07:33.960]   had such a hard time receiving the message of Paul.
[00:07:33.960 --> 00:07:37.120]   The text that we're going to be looking at today, I started this week thinking that I'm
[00:07:37.120 --> 00:07:38.680]   going to go through all four verses.
[00:07:38.680 --> 00:07:41.760]   By the time I got to Wednesday, I realized that I'm probably not going to do that.
[00:07:41.760 --> 00:07:43.760]   I'm going to stop at verse two.
[00:07:43.760 --> 00:07:45.800]   So I'm not going to milk it.
[00:07:45.800 --> 00:07:50.880]   I really think that this is so important, especially for us, every single one of us,
[00:07:50.880 --> 00:07:53.160]   including myself.
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:57.320]   That because you and I live in a post-Christian culture where Christianity just kind of is
[00:07:57.320 --> 00:08:02.580]   secondhand, it's been handed to us, and all you have to do is not resist it.
[00:08:02.580 --> 00:08:06.760]   You don't have to pursue it, you don't have to chase it, you just have to not deny it.
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.160]   Just get on the boat and just do what everybody else is doing.
[00:08:10.160 --> 00:08:12.680]   It's very casual, it's easy.
[00:08:12.680 --> 00:08:18.800]   As a result of that, we can completely miss the central message and central calling of
[00:08:18.800 --> 00:08:21.600]   what it means to be a follower of Jesus Christ.
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:27.520]   So Paul says in verse two, and I'm going to go through this outline just in this verse,
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.960]   because I believe that what he has to say in this verse is not just important, it is
[00:08:30.960 --> 00:08:33.000]   absolutely crucial.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:39.040]   He says to the Jews, "Your zeal, I bear them witness that they have a zeal for God, but
[00:08:39.040 --> 00:08:42.360]   not according to knowledge."
[00:08:42.360 --> 00:08:46.440]   First thing I want to point out here is that Paul is not indicting their zeal.
[00:08:46.440 --> 00:08:49.760]   Paul says, "I actually testify.
[00:08:49.760 --> 00:08:55.400]   I can bear witness that you guys are passionate, that you're zealous."
[00:08:55.400 --> 00:09:00.240]   The problem with Israel was not lack of effort.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.920]   Typically, when something goes wrong, or something is not happening the way that we think it
[00:09:05.920 --> 00:09:11.720]   ought to happen, or it doesn't accomplish the desired goals that we have, our immediate
[00:09:11.720 --> 00:09:16.460]   reaction is, "What can we do differently?"
[00:09:16.460 --> 00:09:20.400]   Maybe we haven't prayed enough, maybe we haven't read enough, maybe we haven't been trained
[00:09:20.400 --> 00:09:22.920]   enough, maybe we haven't been organized enough.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:27.200]   Then all of these things are important things, but that's our natural instinct, because that's
[00:09:27.200 --> 00:09:29.280]   how we know how to solve problems.
[00:09:29.280 --> 00:09:33.120]   See, the nation of Israel, that was not the problem.
[00:09:33.120 --> 00:09:38.180]   It was clear that was not the problem, because their indictment was not that they were not
[00:09:38.180 --> 00:09:42.040]   zealous enough, that they didn't try hard enough.
[00:09:42.040 --> 00:09:45.200]   Paul knows this better than anybody else.
[00:09:45.200 --> 00:09:50.000]   Galatians 1.14, it says, "And I was advancing in Judaism beyond many of my own age among
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:56.880]   my people, so extremely zealous was I for the traditions of my fathers."
[00:09:56.880 --> 00:10:00.800]   Paul was not only one of them, he was a leader among them.
[00:10:00.800 --> 00:10:07.360]   In fact, in Philippians 3.5-6, Paul actually compares his zeal to their zeal.
[00:10:07.360 --> 00:10:11.920]   And the reason why he's doing that is because these Judaizers were accusing him, "Maybe
[00:10:11.920 --> 00:10:14.900]   it's because you're not faithful to the law.
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:17.040]   Maybe you're not a good Jew.
[00:10:17.040 --> 00:10:21.980]   And that's why you're so easily abandoning this system and embracing this whole new way
[00:10:21.980 --> 00:10:24.180]   to get to God."
[00:10:24.180 --> 00:10:29.040]   So basically, Paul is saying, "I'm going to take you upon your challenge.
[00:10:29.040 --> 00:10:33.960]   If you want to weigh the zeal for the law of God, and who's a good Jew, let's go at
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:34.960]   it."
[00:10:34.960 --> 00:10:38.000]   And he's going to sit down, "I'm a Hebrew of Hebrews, that's the law of Pharisees,
[00:10:38.000 --> 00:10:43.980]   to zeal, persecutor of the church, as to righteousness under the law, I was absolutely
[00:10:43.980 --> 00:10:44.980]   blameless."
[00:10:44.980 --> 00:10:49.720]   And no one, no one can accuse him of being a bad Jew.
[00:10:49.720 --> 00:10:55.240]   You remember, Apostle Paul was the one who was responsible for the martyr of Stephen.
[00:10:55.240 --> 00:11:00.360]   Now you have to understand, he might have been a hero in the nation of Israel, but that
[00:11:00.360 --> 00:11:03.680]   would have made him a criminal in the Roman government.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:05.280]   That wasn't enough.
[00:11:05.280 --> 00:11:11.480]   He packed up his bags and gathered a bunch of soldiers and went up all the way to Damascus,
[00:11:11.480 --> 00:11:17.200]   willing to beat up, kill, imprison whoever stood in the way, because he was persecuting
[00:11:17.200 --> 00:11:18.200]   the Christians.
[00:11:18.200 --> 00:11:22.960]   So in other words, when he says, "as to zeal, persecutor of Christians," he was saying,
[00:11:22.960 --> 00:11:26.800]   "I was willing to die, go to prison."
[00:11:26.800 --> 00:11:32.200]   That's how passionate I was for the nation of Israel, for the law.
[00:11:32.200 --> 00:11:37.360]   Paul knew better than anybody else, and he says, "I understand your zeal.
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:41.340]   I bear witness that you had zeal."
[00:11:41.340 --> 00:11:47.620]   But Jesus never condemned the Pharisees for not having enough effort.
[00:11:47.620 --> 00:11:51.480]   He didn't condemn them for not praying enough.
[00:11:51.480 --> 00:11:52.720]   That was not their problem.
[00:11:52.720 --> 00:11:57.160]   He condemned them for why they prayed and how they prayed.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:00.600]   But it wasn't an amount of prayer that he condemned them for.
[00:12:00.600 --> 00:12:04.500]   He didn't condemn the Pharisees for keeping the law.
[00:12:04.500 --> 00:12:11.440]   He never condemned them for that, but he condemned them for keeping the law selectively.
[00:12:11.440 --> 00:12:15.880]   Some of the things that they made weighty, some of the things that they didn't make weighty.
[00:12:15.880 --> 00:12:19.680]   He didn't condemn them for not keeping the Sabbath.
[00:12:19.680 --> 00:12:24.200]   They kept the Sabbath like a person who had OCD.
[00:12:24.200 --> 00:12:28.800]   Every single little thing, they were in fear that they were going to somehow break the
[00:12:28.800 --> 00:12:32.560]   Sabbath, even in a slight way.
[00:12:32.560 --> 00:12:35.760]   They added more and more laws to make sure that they kept it holy.
[00:12:35.760 --> 00:12:39.640]   Jesus never condemned them for not keeping the Sabbath.
[00:12:39.640 --> 00:12:45.960]   He indicted them for not understanding what the Sabbath was for in the first place.
[00:12:45.960 --> 00:12:49.480]   So their indictment was never about their zeal.
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:51.240]   It was never about their effort.
[00:12:51.240 --> 00:12:53.080]   In fact, we go even further.
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:58.040]   In Matthew 23, verse 15, Jesus says, "Woe to you, scribes and Pharisees, you hypocrites,
[00:12:58.040 --> 00:13:03.200]   for you travel across sea and land to make a single proselyte.
[00:13:03.200 --> 00:13:09.680]   And when he becomes a proselyte, you make him twice as much a child of hell as yourself."
[00:13:09.680 --> 00:13:10.680]   Can you believe that?
[00:13:10.680 --> 00:13:14.040]   These Pharisees were actually doing mission work.
[00:13:14.040 --> 00:13:16.900]   They might have been doing short term, maybe long term.
[00:13:16.900 --> 00:13:21.600]   And he says, "You travel across sea and land."
[00:13:21.600 --> 00:13:24.800]   This was not a short term trip where they went and came back.
[00:13:24.800 --> 00:13:28.640]   These guys, a lot of these guys packed their bags and went into foreign countries, risked
[00:13:28.640 --> 00:13:34.840]   their lives crossing the sea to spread what their understanding of righteousness was.
[00:13:34.840 --> 00:13:39.760]   So you're talking about a group of people who were committed to this cause.
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.760]   It wasn't a lack of discipline.
[00:13:40.760 --> 00:13:41.920]   It wasn't a lack of prayer.
[00:13:41.920 --> 00:13:45.120]   It wasn't a lack of trying to keep the law.
[00:13:45.120 --> 00:13:50.880]   In fact, Josephus, the early first century Jewish historian, he actually writes about
[00:13:50.880 --> 00:13:53.960]   their zeal for proselytizing.
[00:13:53.960 --> 00:13:57.720]   Part of the reason why they were so zealous is because they believed, according to their
[00:13:57.720 --> 00:14:01.840]   tradition, not according to the Old Testament teaching, to their tradition, that when they
[00:14:01.840 --> 00:14:07.320]   converted somebody to Judaism, they believed that they were creating a whole new soul.
[00:14:07.320 --> 00:14:11.160]   So in some sense, they were playing God by converting people.
[00:14:11.160 --> 00:14:16.520]   And obviously, if you're talking about merit, there's no greater merit than to create another
[00:14:16.520 --> 00:14:18.880]   soul that they're responsible for.
[00:14:18.880 --> 00:14:22.440]   So you can understand the zeal that they had.
[00:14:22.440 --> 00:14:25.160]   So their problem was not effort.
[00:14:25.160 --> 00:14:26.580]   Their problem was not discipline.
[00:14:26.580 --> 00:14:29.720]   Their problem was not sacrifice.
[00:14:29.720 --> 00:14:35.160]   It's that they had zeal, but it wasn't according to knowledge.
[00:14:35.160 --> 00:14:37.600]   That's the second thing I want to talk about in this text.
[00:14:37.600 --> 00:14:43.600]   Their zeal was motivated, was not motivated by true knowledge.
[00:14:43.600 --> 00:14:48.960]   Now again, in some circles, and I don't think it's in every circle, but in some circles,
[00:14:48.960 --> 00:14:53.160]   and I'm pretty sure you have some friends who think that way too, the moment the term
[00:14:53.160 --> 00:14:55.760]   theology is thrown, it's like, "Oh, you're legalist.
[00:14:55.760 --> 00:14:57.920]   You're one of those people.
[00:14:57.920 --> 00:14:59.800]   You're a Bible thumper."
[00:14:59.800 --> 00:15:06.800]   So the idea of emphasizing too much theology somehow automatically makes you a legalist.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.400]   In fact, I don't know about you, but I've been in so many conversations trying to talk
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:16.560]   to somebody about right theology and the right gospel, and the way that they would excuse
[00:15:16.560 --> 00:15:20.400]   this is, "Well, but look how passionate they are.
[00:15:20.400 --> 00:15:24.000]   Look at how many people come to their services.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:25.320]   Look at so many fruits.
[00:15:25.320 --> 00:15:26.840]   Look at all these things that are happening."
[00:15:26.840 --> 00:15:31.680]   So even though they're not preaching the right gospel, they're a good people.
[00:15:31.680 --> 00:15:35.800]   In fact, some of these people are much better than these people who are Calvinists or these
[00:15:35.800 --> 00:15:38.200]   supposed theologians.
[00:15:38.200 --> 00:15:43.520]   And so if they're passionate, if they're giving a lot of effort, somehow that excuses that.
[00:15:43.520 --> 00:15:46.960]   Well, Apostle Paul says it clear to the nation of Israel.
[00:15:46.960 --> 00:15:49.000]   He said, "It wasn't lack of passion.
[00:15:49.000 --> 00:15:54.160]   It was passion, but wasn't based upon true knowledge."
[00:15:54.160 --> 00:15:57.760]   You know, I read an article this week about Brad Pitt.
[00:15:57.760 --> 00:16:02.760]   Yeah, you're probably thinking, "Why is he reading about Brad Pitt?"
[00:16:02.760 --> 00:16:07.960]   I read this article about Brad Pitt because the title of the article says, "Why Brad
[00:16:07.960 --> 00:16:12.120]   Pitt, who grew up in a Christian home, became an atheist."
[00:16:12.120 --> 00:16:16.000]   And so I was reading that and it said he grew up in a very staunch, committed Christian
[00:16:16.000 --> 00:16:18.420]   home, a Baptist home.
[00:16:18.420 --> 00:16:21.600]   And he says when he was younger, he would go to these retreats or he would go to these
[00:16:21.600 --> 00:16:25.880]   revivals and he would come back filled with the Holy Spirit.
[00:16:25.880 --> 00:16:27.480]   And he said he was on fire for God.
[00:16:27.480 --> 00:16:30.480]   He's experienced all these things, so he knows all the lingo.
[00:16:30.480 --> 00:16:31.520]   He's been to retreats.
[00:16:31.520 --> 00:16:34.320]   He's been to Mexico and doing all...
[00:16:34.320 --> 00:16:35.800]   Because he's a church kid.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:38.560]   He grew up in a church.
[00:16:38.560 --> 00:16:44.280]   But he said, and he doesn't pinpoint one thing, but one of the things that he said on that
[00:16:44.280 --> 00:16:48.000]   article that was surprising, and this is what he says.
[00:16:48.000 --> 00:16:53.840]   He said, "I'd go to a Christian revival and be moved by the Holy Spirit, and then I'd
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.080]   go to a rock concert and feel the same fervor."
[00:16:59.080 --> 00:17:04.200]   And he interpreted that as, well, that same kind of hype and that emotion, that passion
[00:17:04.200 --> 00:17:06.400]   that I thought was the Holy Spirit.
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:11.160]   Well, when I went to the rock concert, I realized that they were experiencing the same thing,
[00:17:11.160 --> 00:17:13.020]   but it was just rock music.
[00:17:13.020 --> 00:17:15.360]   So it was just hype.
[00:17:15.360 --> 00:17:16.640]   And that's what he saw.
[00:17:16.640 --> 00:17:18.800]   He felt empty.
[00:17:18.800 --> 00:17:19.880]   It wasn't real.
[00:17:19.880 --> 00:17:20.960]   It was just hype.
[00:17:20.960 --> 00:17:22.600]   It was just emotion.
[00:17:22.600 --> 00:17:28.680]   See, Apostle Paul says of the nation of Israel that there's zeal, there's passion, there's
[00:17:28.680 --> 00:17:35.000]   commitment, there's sacrifice, but it wasn't in accordance with knowledge.
[00:17:35.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   Before we get carried away and think, "Well, good thing we're not charismatic, that we
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:46.080]   don't believe in emotions here, so we're safe," before we start to think, "Well, I have enough
[00:17:46.080 --> 00:17:49.760]   theology, and I've read enough books, and I know right and wrong.
[00:17:49.760 --> 00:17:51.400]   I've been hearing good preaching.
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.800]   I've been studying the Word of God.
[00:17:52.800 --> 00:17:55.200]   I've been reading the right books."
[00:17:55.200 --> 00:17:59.880]   Just because we have all of these things, that's not what Paul is saying.
[00:17:59.880 --> 00:18:06.120]   In fact, the word that he uses for knowledge here is epigenosko.
[00:18:06.120 --> 00:18:10.920]   And I'm just going to read directly what it says in the Word Study of the New Testament.
[00:18:10.920 --> 00:18:11.920]   This is what it says.
[00:18:11.920 --> 00:18:17.120]   This word that we have for knowledge here is, "It is more intense than gnosis," the
[00:18:17.120 --> 00:18:22.000]   word knowledge, "because it expresses a more thorough participation in the acquiring of
[00:18:22.000 --> 00:18:24.600]   knowledge on the part of the learner.
[00:18:24.600 --> 00:18:29.600]   In the New Testament, it often refers to knowledge which very powerfully influences the form
[00:18:29.600 --> 00:18:35.920]   of religious life, a knowledge-laying claim to personal involvement."
[00:18:35.920 --> 00:18:39.520]   He's not simply talking about assenting to saying the right things.
[00:18:39.520 --> 00:18:43.800]   "Oh, I believe that, that Jesus Christ was the Son of God, that I know what verse to
[00:18:43.800 --> 00:18:45.480]   go to, and I know how to answer.
[00:18:45.480 --> 00:18:48.320]   I know all the right theology because I've been taught properly."
[00:18:48.320 --> 00:18:50.600]   He's not simply talking about that.
[00:18:50.600 --> 00:18:51.600]   That's part of it.
[00:18:51.600 --> 00:18:58.960]   It may be the beginning of it, but again, this word epigenosis is used in Matthew 22:29,
[00:18:58.960 --> 00:19:01.800]   where Jesus indicts, again, the Pharisees.
[00:19:01.800 --> 00:19:08.200]   He says to them, "You are wrong because you neither know the Scriptures or the power of
[00:19:08.200 --> 00:19:09.200]   God."
[00:19:09.200 --> 00:19:14.720]   Now, any Jew would listen to that and say, "What do you mean we don't know the Scriptures?
[00:19:14.720 --> 00:19:18.340]   I mean, we've been reading and studying the Bible.
[00:19:18.340 --> 00:19:19.340]   We have this thing memorized.
[00:19:19.340 --> 00:19:22.640]   What do you mean we don't know?
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:24.080]   What do you mean we don't know the power of God?
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:26.920]   We were eyewitnesses of His power.
[00:19:26.920 --> 00:19:29.320]   If you asked Him, "Do you believe God is powerful?"
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:30.320]   "Absolutely!
[00:19:30.320 --> 00:19:33.320]   Our God is almighty!
[00:19:33.320 --> 00:19:35.520]   The Lord our God, the Lord is one.
[00:19:35.520 --> 00:19:36.960]   That's us!
[00:19:36.960 --> 00:19:37.960]   We confess that.
[00:19:37.960 --> 00:19:38.960]   We believe that."
[00:19:38.960 --> 00:19:43.960]   So why does Jesus say, "You don't know the Scriptures, and you don't know the power of
[00:19:43.960 --> 00:19:46.500]   God."
[00:19:46.500 --> 00:19:48.560]   You know it mentally.
[00:19:48.560 --> 00:19:51.080]   You know it theologically.
[00:19:51.080 --> 00:19:53.400]   But you are not convicted.
[00:19:53.400 --> 00:19:55.080]   You don't really know Him.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:59.440]   2 Timothy 3.7, He says, "In the last days, there are going to be people who are always
[00:19:59.440 --> 00:20:05.760]   learning but never able to arrive at the knowledge of the truth."
[00:20:05.760 --> 00:20:09.840]   Always learning but never able to acknowledge the truth.
[00:20:09.840 --> 00:20:13.920]   Now, if what He's saying about knowledge, "Oh, it has to be based on at least correct
[00:20:13.920 --> 00:20:17.280]   theology," then we're always learning.
[00:20:17.280 --> 00:20:21.240]   But obviously, that's not what He's referring to.
[00:20:21.240 --> 00:20:26.320]   He's not simply talking about having right theology and saying the right things.
[00:20:26.320 --> 00:20:32.400]   As important as that is, the epi in front of the gnoscle basically takes us further
[00:20:32.400 --> 00:20:33.400]   than that.
[00:20:33.400 --> 00:20:36.160]   It is an intense form of knowledge.
[00:20:36.160 --> 00:20:43.000]   It is a kind of encounter that you have with God that absolutely changes you.
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:48.680]   The Christ of the cross that you encounter changes your perspective.
[00:20:48.680 --> 00:20:53.520]   The reason why we worship, the reason why we evangelize, the reason why we serve is
[00:20:53.520 --> 00:20:57.160]   not simply because we have the right theology and we have the right doing and that's what
[00:20:57.160 --> 00:20:58.160]   makes us kosher.
[00:20:58.160 --> 00:20:59.160]   He says, "No."
[00:20:59.160 --> 00:21:04.360]   What He's saying is, "You don't know God.
[00:21:04.360 --> 00:21:06.520]   You know His Word.
[00:21:06.520 --> 00:21:11.040]   You can attest to His power, but you don't know Him.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:16.840]   All the efforts that you're giving, it's your effort, it's your ability, but you have no
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.400]   faith."
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.040]   Their problem was not that they didn't give enough effort.
[00:21:24.040 --> 00:21:27.400]   Their problem is not that they didn't pray enough, they didn't give enough, or they didn't
[00:21:27.400 --> 00:21:29.160]   read enough.
[00:21:29.160 --> 00:21:32.920]   They didn't know Christ.
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.000]   You see why this is so dangerous in our culture?
[00:21:37.000 --> 00:21:42.320]   You and I live in a culture where we have more access to the Bible, more preaching,
[00:21:42.320 --> 00:21:49.440]   more theology, more fellowship, more opportunities to do work than any other generation, any other
[00:21:49.440 --> 00:21:54.080]   Christian has ever had access to, ever.
[00:21:54.080 --> 00:22:00.100]   And yet we are in the greatest danger of this exact same thing.
[00:22:00.100 --> 00:22:02.080]   Because we're busy.
[00:22:02.080 --> 00:22:03.160]   We're busy doing God's work.
[00:22:03.160 --> 00:22:04.400]   We're busy feeding the poor.
[00:22:04.400 --> 00:22:05.800]   We're busy doing Bible study.
[00:22:05.800 --> 00:22:07.840]   We're busy having fellowship.
[00:22:07.840 --> 00:22:13.400]   And he says, "Well, the Jews were just as busy, maybe even busier, but they completely
[00:22:13.400 --> 00:22:16.240]   missed Christ."
[00:22:16.240 --> 00:22:20.280]   You see why this is so, so important?
[00:22:20.280 --> 00:22:25.880]   Third and final part that I want to take a few minutes to talk about is the characteristics
[00:22:25.880 --> 00:22:28.840]   of zeal without knowledge.
[00:22:28.840 --> 00:22:33.280]   Now I would like to take credit for this, but this is actually from Martin Lloyd-Jones.
[00:22:33.280 --> 00:22:35.520]   His was actually a list of ten things.
[00:22:35.520 --> 00:22:37.880]   I condensed it to four, okay?
[00:22:37.880 --> 00:22:41.480]   And I think because there's a lot of overlapping.
[00:22:41.480 --> 00:22:47.240]   I think these four things does a good summary of things that we need to watch for.
[00:22:47.240 --> 00:22:55.640]   First of all, he said, "False zeal is motivated by fear of man rather than fear of God."
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.500]   False zeal is motivated by the fear of man rather than fear of God.
[00:23:00.500 --> 00:23:06.160]   In Matthew 23, 5-8, Jesus indicts the Pharisees that they do all their deeds to be seen by
[00:23:06.160 --> 00:23:12.660]   others for they make their phylacteries broad and their fringes long, and they love the
[00:23:12.660 --> 00:23:17.120]   places of honor at feasts and at the best seats in the synagogues and greetings in the
[00:23:17.120 --> 00:23:20.440]   marketplaces and being called rabbi by others.
[00:23:20.440 --> 00:23:24.140]   Their whole motivation was fear of man.
[00:23:24.140 --> 00:23:26.220]   If I do this, what would they think?
[00:23:26.220 --> 00:23:32.160]   So their whole effort is fixated on how people respond.
[00:23:32.160 --> 00:23:37.180]   So if people, if they get honor for the activity that they're doing, then they give a lot of
[00:23:37.180 --> 00:23:38.180]   time to do that.
[00:23:38.180 --> 00:23:42.960]   In fact, even their whole prayer life in Matthew 6, 5, it says, "When you pray, you must not
[00:23:42.960 --> 00:23:47.980]   be like the hypocrites, for they love to stand and pray in the synagogues and at the street
[00:23:47.980 --> 00:23:50.540]   corners that they may be seen by others.
[00:23:50.540 --> 00:23:52.900]   Truly I say to you, they have received their reward."
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.060]   See, they're not being reviewed for not praying.
[00:23:56.060 --> 00:24:01.660]   But it was why they were praying, who they were praying for, what they were praying for.
[00:24:01.660 --> 00:24:03.700]   They didn't lack zeal.
[00:24:03.700 --> 00:24:05.980]   They didn't lack effort.
[00:24:05.980 --> 00:24:08.720]   But they didn't know Christ.
[00:24:08.720 --> 00:24:13.220]   Their motivation was by fear of man.
[00:24:13.220 --> 00:24:17.500]   In contrast, true zeal, we see in Apostle Paul.
[00:24:17.500 --> 00:24:19.260]   I mean, I've said this so many times.
[00:24:19.260 --> 00:24:24.420]   Every time I read the Corinthians, there's a side of me that's always like, "Why does
[00:24:24.420 --> 00:24:26.300]   he care?"
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:32.780]   I know why he cares, but there's a side of me, my flesh comes out like, "Drop these suckers!"
[00:24:32.780 --> 00:24:34.900]   You risk your life to bring the gospel.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:38.940]   You planted this church and you sacrificed all of this, and now they're questioning your
[00:24:38.940 --> 00:24:39.940]   apostleship.
[00:24:39.940 --> 00:24:43.220]   Now he's writing a letter, they didn't like the first letter, and then now he said, "Maybe
[00:24:43.220 --> 00:24:45.500]   he's not an apostle.
[00:24:45.500 --> 00:24:46.700]   Maybe I follow these other guys."
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:51.500]   And he's writing this gut-wrenching letter to this church that he so loved.
[00:24:51.500 --> 00:24:53.460]   Like, why?
[00:24:53.460 --> 00:24:55.020]   If he just moved on, think about it.
[00:24:55.020 --> 00:24:59.980]   Apostle Paul had enough on his plate to worry about this group.
[00:24:59.980 --> 00:25:02.700]   Just move on.
[00:25:02.700 --> 00:25:03.700]   Paul doesn't do that.
[00:25:03.700 --> 00:25:08.220]   He writes this gut-wrenching letter to this church pleading with them.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:10.140]   But here's the heart of why.
[00:25:10.140 --> 00:25:15.680]   He says 2 Corinthians 5, 17, "For the love of Christ controls us."
[00:25:15.680 --> 00:25:21.940]   If he was a man who was motivated by the fear of man, as soon as he's not honored, as soon
[00:25:21.940 --> 00:25:26.220]   as he's not accepted, shake off your dust, just move on.
[00:25:26.220 --> 00:25:31.780]   The reason why he endures is because the love of Christ in the NIV says compels him.
[00:25:31.780 --> 00:25:37.500]   He's a man who encountered this Christ.
[00:25:37.500 --> 00:25:46.020]   Despite all of his sins, despite all of his failures, despite all he was going to do,
[00:25:46.020 --> 00:25:50.860]   Christ sacrificed his life for his.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.060]   He was chained forever.
[00:25:54.060 --> 00:25:55.460]   His life was worth nothing.
[00:25:55.460 --> 00:25:59.340]   In fact, if it was up to him, he said, "I'd rather be with him."
[00:25:59.340 --> 00:26:01.340]   He says, "The love of Christ compels me.
[00:26:01.340 --> 00:26:06.360]   The only reason why I want to be here, why I'm here, is because it means fruitful labor
[00:26:06.360 --> 00:26:08.980]   for me in you."
[00:26:08.980 --> 00:26:16.120]   Again in Acts chapter 4, 18-21, the early apostles, Peter and John, said, "After being
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:21.460]   whipped and beaten, they called them and charged them, the leaders of Israel, not to speak
[00:26:21.460 --> 00:26:24.580]   or teach at all in the name of Jesus.
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:28.180]   But Peter and John answered them, 'Whether it is right in the sight of God to listen
[00:26:28.180 --> 00:26:34.580]   to you rather than to God, you must judge, for we cannot but speak of what we have seen
[00:26:34.580 --> 00:26:35.580]   and heard.'"
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.820]   I mean, these are the same people who crucified Jesus.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:45.500]   Peter, just a few days ago, was denying Jesus to his faith because he was afraid that he
[00:26:45.500 --> 00:26:48.380]   was going to get crucified.
[00:26:48.380 --> 00:26:52.380]   If he was motivated by the fear of man, this makes absolutely no sense.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:53.380]   He says, "Hey, don't do this.
[00:26:53.380 --> 00:26:54.380]   You're going to die."
[00:26:54.380 --> 00:26:55.380]   I mean, they meant it.
[00:26:55.380 --> 00:26:57.760]   They actually carried it out.
[00:26:57.760 --> 00:27:02.180]   What gave them this courage to say, "Is it right for me to listen to you rather than
[00:27:02.180 --> 00:27:05.620]   to God?" and kept on preaching?
[00:27:05.620 --> 00:27:09.460]   He encountered the resurrected Christ.
[00:27:09.460 --> 00:27:15.740]   He encountered the resurrected Christ and his whole paradigm of life, of good, of success
[00:27:15.740 --> 00:27:19.820]   and honor completely got changed.
[00:27:19.820 --> 00:27:21.780]   His world got flipped upside down.
[00:27:21.780 --> 00:27:25.840]   His value system completely changed.
[00:27:25.840 --> 00:27:28.780]   So that's why they were able to risk their lives because they were not motivated by fear
[00:27:28.780 --> 00:27:29.780]   of man.
[00:27:29.780 --> 00:27:32.940]   It was the fear of God.
[00:27:32.940 --> 00:27:39.460]   Secondly, he says, false zeal is focused on the external rather than the internal.
[00:27:39.460 --> 00:27:42.020]   These are obviously all interconnected.
[00:27:42.020 --> 00:27:46.300]   If you're motivated by the fear of man, you can only be judged by the things that they
[00:27:46.300 --> 00:27:48.420]   can see.
[00:27:48.420 --> 00:27:52.000]   So obviously, everything is focused on external.
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:55.100]   How do we change what's happening externally?
[00:27:55.100 --> 00:27:58.940]   The Pharisees were constantly concerned about how people honored them.
[00:27:58.940 --> 00:28:03.480]   In fact, one of the very reasons why they turned against Jesus was because Jesus was
[00:28:03.480 --> 00:28:04.480]   calling them out.
[00:28:04.480 --> 00:28:07.060]   I mean, that's embarrassing.
[00:28:07.060 --> 00:28:11.300]   Initially they were coming out, "If this man is really a prophet of God, we better
[00:28:11.300 --> 00:28:12.580]   be the first in line."
[00:28:12.580 --> 00:28:16.820]   But when they would get in line, what would John the Baptist and Jesus do?
[00:28:16.820 --> 00:28:19.940]   They'd whitewash tombs.
[00:28:19.940 --> 00:28:23.980]   You guys spend all your time cleaning up the outside, but inside it's filled with dead
[00:28:23.980 --> 00:28:24.980]   men's bones.
[00:28:24.980 --> 00:28:26.580]   It's just a whitewashed tomb.
[00:28:26.580 --> 00:28:27.740]   And he embarrasses them.
[00:28:27.740 --> 00:28:31.900]   I mean, if their whole goal was to be honored by people, Jesus made it very difficult for
[00:28:31.900 --> 00:28:32.900]   them.
[00:28:32.900 --> 00:28:37.500]   So as a result of that, he said, "We need to get rid of this guy."
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.940]   Their whole focus was external.
[00:28:39.940 --> 00:28:47.340]   In fact, in 1 Timothy 3, 2-3, we have the qualification of an elder.
[00:28:47.340 --> 00:28:49.980]   You know, we may read that and say, "Well, I'm not an elder.
[00:28:49.980 --> 00:28:53.380]   I don't have any aspiration to be an elder, so therefore these things don't apply to
[00:28:53.380 --> 00:28:54.380]   me."
[00:28:54.380 --> 00:28:55.380]   Absolutely not.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:59.540]   These qualifications are for men who are to set an example to the rest of the church to
[00:28:59.540 --> 00:29:01.020]   follow.
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:06.140]   These are examples, characteristics that every man and woman ought to follow.
[00:29:06.140 --> 00:29:11.020]   And in the qualification of an elder, he said, "An overseer must be above reproach, husband
[00:29:11.020 --> 00:29:16.860]   of one wife, sober-minded, self-controlled, respectable, hospitable, able to teach, not
[00:29:16.860 --> 00:29:21.940]   to be drunkard, not violent but gentle, not quarrelsome, not lover of money," and on
[00:29:21.940 --> 00:29:22.940]   and on and on.
[00:29:22.940 --> 00:29:28.260]   And if you look at that, the majority of what he says is about character.
[00:29:28.260 --> 00:29:30.260]   It's about character.
[00:29:30.260 --> 00:29:36.700]   He doesn't talk about, "We need overseers who are good managers of money."
[00:29:36.700 --> 00:29:38.780]   I mean, that definitely helps.
[00:29:38.780 --> 00:29:41.460]   Organizers, definitely helps.
[00:29:41.460 --> 00:29:43.780]   Talented, gifted, hard workers.
[00:29:43.780 --> 00:29:47.060]   All of these things are good qualities to have.
[00:29:47.060 --> 00:29:49.860]   But those are not the qualities listed.
[00:29:49.860 --> 00:29:57.940]   The qualities that are listed of an exemplary man for the rest of the church are all characters.
[00:29:57.940 --> 00:30:01.260]   Transformation that is taking place internally.
[00:30:01.260 --> 00:30:05.100]   So that whether we do, again, according to the eyes of the world, a good job or a bad
[00:30:05.100 --> 00:30:10.900]   job, that he calls men who are being transformed internally.
[00:30:10.900 --> 00:30:19.340]   But zeal without knowledge, without encountering Christ, is always focused on the external.
[00:30:19.340 --> 00:30:22.060]   Because we're driven by fear of men.
[00:30:22.060 --> 00:30:26.740]   Thirdly, he says false zeal usually lacks balance.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:35.060]   Again, this is, and I thought this was very insightful because it makes total sense.
[00:30:35.060 --> 00:30:41.140]   If an individual is highlighting what he's good at for the purpose of honor, to get attention
[00:30:41.140 --> 00:30:46.220]   from other people, or maybe fear of what other people will say if I don't do this, there's
[00:30:46.220 --> 00:30:50.340]   a tendency to be lopsided in their emphasis.
[00:30:50.340 --> 00:30:56.420]   So if you happen to be good in missions, then you kind of elevate, yeah, we need to do missions.
[00:30:56.420 --> 00:30:57.420]   We have to do missions.
[00:30:57.420 --> 00:30:58.780]   How come nobody else is doing missions?
[00:30:58.780 --> 00:31:02.820]   And we usually elevate missions and we judge everybody according to that one particular
[00:31:02.820 --> 00:31:03.820]   thing.
[00:31:03.820 --> 00:31:07.180]   If you happen to be about social justice, that's the hobby horse that you end up riding.
[00:31:07.180 --> 00:31:11.100]   It's all about social justice, helping the poor, and we elevate that.
[00:31:11.100 --> 00:31:14.460]   And then we judge everybody based upon whether you're doing that or not.
[00:31:14.460 --> 00:31:16.620]   But usually completely lopsided.
[00:31:16.620 --> 00:31:18.580]   That could be discipleship.
[00:31:18.580 --> 00:31:20.940]   That could be theology.
[00:31:20.940 --> 00:31:22.740]   That could be prayer.
[00:31:22.740 --> 00:31:27.100]   Whatever it is that that person is good at ends up being elevated, and then everybody
[00:31:27.100 --> 00:31:30.920]   else is judged according to that one thing.
[00:31:30.920 --> 00:31:33.580]   And then all the other things that you're not good at, you just kind of sweep under
[00:31:33.580 --> 00:31:39.940]   the rug because the goal of it is not to necessarily meet Christ and glorify Christ and become
[00:31:39.940 --> 00:31:40.940]   like him.
[00:31:40.940 --> 00:31:46.700]   It is to elevate himself, to honor.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:50.300]   So there's a tendency to lack balance.
[00:31:50.300 --> 00:31:56.600]   And fourth and finally, falseo elevates themselves rather than God.
[00:31:56.600 --> 00:32:03.260]   If your whole motivation is fear of man and not fear of God, then everything that you
[00:32:03.260 --> 00:32:08.140]   do, even if you have the name Christ in it, the ultimate goal is to elevate yourself.
[00:32:08.140 --> 00:32:14.820]   You know, we talk about, "I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength."
[00:32:14.820 --> 00:32:20.460]   But the way that that is read by this individual, a zeal without knowledge, is, "I can do all
[00:32:20.460 --> 00:32:23.500]   things through who gives me strength."
[00:32:23.500 --> 00:32:24.500]   This is I.
[00:32:24.500 --> 00:32:29.100]   I give glory to God.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:33.860]   So that we talk about God, we talk about strength, but it's I.
[00:32:33.860 --> 00:32:39.700]   I can do all things through Christ who gives me strength.
[00:32:39.700 --> 00:32:44.300]   I give glory to God.
[00:32:44.300 --> 00:32:45.300]   It's about I.
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:46.300]   It's about self-exaltation.
[00:32:46.300 --> 00:32:49.780]   It's about what he's able to do, what he cannot, what he's able to do.
[00:32:49.780 --> 00:32:57.820]   Because it's all motivated by self-interest, by human fear.
[00:32:57.820 --> 00:33:02.100]   But Paul in 1 Corinthians 15, 10, it says, "But by the grace of God I am what I am, and
[00:33:02.100 --> 00:33:05.140]   his grace toward me was not in vain.
[00:33:05.140 --> 00:33:09.800]   On the contrary, I worked harder than any of them, though it was not I, but the grace
[00:33:09.800 --> 00:33:11.580]   of God that is with me."
[00:33:11.580 --> 00:33:17.940]   Apostle Paul was a man who was humbled by the grace of God.
[00:33:17.940 --> 00:33:24.060]   He worked harder than anybody else, but he knew full well that that wasn't him.
[00:33:24.060 --> 00:33:27.260]   It was because he was affected by the cross.
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:31.860]   He saw the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ, and he was never the same.
[00:33:31.860 --> 00:33:36.260]   So all that he was doing, he said, "If you're asking me who I am, I am the worst of sinners,
[00:33:36.260 --> 00:33:39.580]   but it's only by the grace of God that I am who I am."
[00:33:39.580 --> 00:33:46.060]   Again in Colossians 1, 28, 29, "In him we proclaim, warning everyone and teaching everyone
[00:33:46.060 --> 00:33:51.100]   with all wisdom that we may present everyone mature in Christ, for this I toil, struggling
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:55.700]   with all his energy that he powerfully works within me."
[00:33:55.700 --> 00:34:03.380]   So you had a man and a woman who has encountered Christ, the Christ of the cross.
[00:34:03.380 --> 00:34:07.420]   First thing that happens when you're in the presence of something bigger than you, first
[00:34:07.420 --> 00:34:11.860]   thing that happens is you forget about yourself.
[00:34:11.860 --> 00:34:16.300]   You forget about yourself.
[00:34:16.300 --> 00:34:18.760]   Isn't that the first thing that happens?
[00:34:18.760 --> 00:34:24.760]   If something wows you, maybe you're going through Facebook and some video, something
[00:34:24.760 --> 00:34:29.020]   catches your attention, you might have been hungry, but for that moment you forget.
[00:34:29.020 --> 00:34:34.500]   You have to go to the bathroom, but for that moment you forget.
[00:34:34.500 --> 00:34:39.380]   You go watch a baseball game or a football game or a basketball game and something spectacular
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.420]   happens, whatever it is that you were concerned about.
[00:34:41.420 --> 00:34:44.900]   You might have had a migraine.
[00:34:44.900 --> 00:34:50.500]   For that split second in the presence of something magnificent, you forget about yourself.
[00:34:50.500 --> 00:34:55.700]   See, that's the quality that we see in Apostle Paul.
[00:34:55.700 --> 00:34:59.740]   He's a man who was so enamored by Christ and what he has done, the first thing that happens
[00:34:59.740 --> 00:35:04.260]   is like, "I'm doing all of this stuff, but it is not me.
[00:35:04.260 --> 00:35:06.900]   It's him."
[00:35:06.900 --> 00:35:16.980]   Imagine the ridiculousness of the proposition that Christ has called us to change ourselves.
[00:35:16.980 --> 00:35:23.100]   And then not only to change ourselves, and then to go and change other people.
[00:35:23.100 --> 00:35:28.020]   I don't know how many of you have ever done any kind of sales.
[00:35:28.020 --> 00:35:32.220]   Some of you guys may have that kind of personality and maybe you're good at sales.
[00:35:32.220 --> 00:35:36.180]   I don't care how good you are at sales.
[00:35:36.180 --> 00:35:41.420]   Maybe you're the type of person that can sell used vacuum cleaners.
[00:35:41.420 --> 00:35:42.420]   But it's difficult.
[00:35:42.420 --> 00:35:46.380]   Can you imagine how difficult it would be to sell a product that you know down the street
[00:35:46.380 --> 00:35:49.180]   is selling for half the price and is newer than yours?
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:53.300]   But you've been given the task to go sell so many of these.
[00:35:53.300 --> 00:36:00.820]   I mean, as difficult as that may be, can you imagine the task to go convert people?
[00:36:00.820 --> 00:36:08.020]   You know, to convert people to Jesus Christ means that everything that they've been working
[00:36:08.020 --> 00:36:12.740]   up to that point, you're asking them to surrender that.
[00:36:12.740 --> 00:36:15.560]   Make Christ your Lord.
[00:36:15.560 --> 00:36:19.140]   The reason why Jesus Christ had to die was because everything you did up to that point
[00:36:19.140 --> 00:36:22.060]   was absolutely wrong.
[00:36:22.060 --> 00:36:23.060]   Your speech was wrong.
[00:36:23.060 --> 00:36:24.660]   Your thoughts were wrong.
[00:36:24.660 --> 00:36:25.780]   Where you were going was wrong.
[00:36:25.780 --> 00:36:28.220]   Why you chose certain jobs were wrong.
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:30.620]   The things that you were attracted to was wrong.
[00:36:30.620 --> 00:36:32.260]   What you're hoping for was wrong.
[00:36:32.260 --> 00:36:35.860]   The money you put into the bank, what you're planning to do with that was wrong.
[00:36:35.860 --> 00:36:37.900]   Everything that you were doing up to that point was wrong.
[00:36:37.900 --> 00:36:41.260]   Now you surrender all of that, give it to Christ, and pick up your cross and follow
[00:36:41.260 --> 00:36:43.740]   Him.
[00:36:43.740 --> 00:36:50.100]   Can you imagine if that's what Christ called us to do?
[00:36:50.100 --> 00:36:55.660]   I mean, if you can do that by your own strength, by your own might, I mean, I want to put some
[00:36:55.660 --> 00:36:57.900]   stock in you.
[00:36:57.900 --> 00:37:00.440]   Because you're going to be a billionaire.
[00:37:00.440 --> 00:37:04.580]   Because you're going to be able to sell socks that was used.
[00:37:04.580 --> 00:37:08.300]   You're going to be able to sell ice to Eskimos, right?
[00:37:08.300 --> 00:37:13.440]   If you can somehow, by your effort, convince somebody to turn their life, give up everything
[00:37:13.440 --> 00:37:15.620]   and follow Christ.
[00:37:15.620 --> 00:37:18.780]   And then by your own effort, become a different person.
[00:37:18.780 --> 00:37:19.780]   You were an extrovert.
[00:37:19.780 --> 00:37:21.260]   God calls you to be an introvert.
[00:37:21.260 --> 00:37:23.200]   Now you have to live like an introvert.
[00:37:23.200 --> 00:37:26.700]   That would be easier.
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:32.060]   To do this and will yourself to change and then will others to change.
[00:37:32.060 --> 00:37:37.540]   You would be the best motivational speaker, best apologist, best salesperson that this
[00:37:37.540 --> 00:37:39.700]   world has ever seen.
[00:37:39.700 --> 00:37:41.860]   If that's what He called us to do.
[00:37:41.860 --> 00:37:45.220]   See, that's what He was indicting the nation of Israel.
[00:37:45.220 --> 00:37:48.220]   You are working hard.
[00:37:48.220 --> 00:37:52.860]   You're giving yourself to godliness and prayer and even proselytizing.
[00:37:52.860 --> 00:37:58.060]   But by your own might, it is absolutely useless.
[00:37:58.060 --> 00:38:01.720]   It is without knowledge.
[00:38:01.720 --> 00:38:05.040]   But that's not what He called us to do.
[00:38:05.040 --> 00:38:08.220]   Even proselytizing, He didn't say, "Go and make disciples.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:09.740]   Find the best strategy.
[00:38:09.740 --> 00:38:10.820]   Focus on the right people.
[00:38:10.820 --> 00:38:12.000]   Give them the right tools.
[00:38:12.000 --> 00:38:15.540]   If you go and train them and give them the right knowledge, they'll be able to go and
[00:38:15.540 --> 00:38:17.180]   convert people.
[00:38:17.180 --> 00:38:18.600]   They'll be able to make disciples."
[00:38:18.600 --> 00:38:23.860]   I mean, think about the task of that, humanly speaking.
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.380]   He didn't say that, did He?
[00:38:25.380 --> 00:38:30.460]   He said, "You will be my witnesses.
[00:38:30.460 --> 00:38:35.020]   You will receive power, not because of your effort, not because of your education, not
[00:38:35.020 --> 00:38:39.620]   because of your many years of experience, not because of your education, not because
[00:38:39.620 --> 00:38:42.880]   of your talent or because you're articulate.
[00:38:42.880 --> 00:38:44.620]   You will receive power when?
[00:38:44.620 --> 00:38:47.520]   When the Holy Spirit comes out inside of you.
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.080]   Something completely foreign that you know nothing about because of what Christ has done
[00:38:52.080 --> 00:38:54.080]   on the cross.
[00:38:54.080 --> 00:38:58.140]   That He took an empty vessel and made it a new wineskin that the Holy Spirit, something
[00:38:58.140 --> 00:39:03.500]   completely foreign that you had nothing to do about, when that comes upon you, you will
[00:39:03.500 --> 00:39:08.620]   receive power and you will be my witnesses in Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria, to the remotest
[00:39:08.620 --> 00:39:11.500]   part of the world."
[00:39:11.500 --> 00:39:16.180]   That was the only way that the gospel was going to spread.
[00:39:16.180 --> 00:39:21.700]   That was the only way that you and I could ever change.
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:29.780]   That's why zeal without knowledge is absolutely frustrating.
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:37.700]   What we lack today isn't strategy, it isn't better funding, it isn't better organization
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:40.260]   or better education or better training.
[00:39:40.260 --> 00:39:45.780]   All of these things have its place, but that is not what we lack.
[00:39:45.780 --> 00:39:50.260]   Second Peter 1.3, it says, "His divine power has granted to us all things that pertain
[00:39:50.260 --> 00:39:57.620]   to life and godliness through the knowledge of Him who called us to His own glory and
[00:39:57.620 --> 00:40:00.400]   excellence."
[00:40:00.400 --> 00:40:06.940]   At the core of our salvation is encountering Christ.
[00:40:06.940 --> 00:40:09.800]   That's when justification happens.
[00:40:09.800 --> 00:40:12.500]   And that's how sanctification happens.
[00:40:12.500 --> 00:40:16.100]   That's how ultimately glorification will happen.
[00:40:16.100 --> 00:40:23.700]   When we encounter this Christ of the Bible at Paganosco, and He changes us.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:30.620]   So our goal in our worship isn't simply to know what the Bible says, it's to encounter
[00:40:30.620 --> 00:40:33.180]   this Christ of the Bible.
[00:40:33.180 --> 00:40:37.940]   Our goal in the book of Revelation is not to simply know how the end time is going to
[00:40:37.940 --> 00:40:39.480]   roll out.
[00:40:39.480 --> 00:40:41.180]   It is a revelation of what?
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:42.180]   Jesus Christ.
[00:40:42.180 --> 00:40:45.020]   We learned this this Wednesday.
[00:40:45.020 --> 00:40:48.060]   The goal of prayer meeting is not to get it done.
[00:40:48.060 --> 00:40:51.540]   It is to encounter this Christ of the Bible.
[00:40:51.540 --> 00:40:56.740]   So all that we are doing, all that we are singing, all the fellowship that we have,
[00:40:56.740 --> 00:41:03.820]   really, is to bring and gather people to encounter Christ.
[00:41:03.820 --> 00:41:07.740]   We can be the best theologian, we can be the best organized, we can have the best funding
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:14.500]   with the nicest people, and we can become the biggest church and be absolutely empty
[00:41:14.500 --> 00:41:22.180]   and hollow if it is zeal without knowledge.
[00:41:22.180 --> 00:41:31.380]   I pray with all my heart, and again, I told you in the beginning why this is so crucial.
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:35.060]   I mean, just speak from my heart.
[00:41:35.060 --> 00:41:42.540]   I don't know, on the day of judgment, how many people in Orange County are really going
[00:41:42.540 --> 00:41:49.940]   to be saved, according to what I see in Scripture.
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:54.220]   I know there are a lot of people who haven't heard the gospel.
[00:41:54.220 --> 00:41:56.780]   There are people in India, there are people in China, there are people all over the place
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.780]   who have never heard the gospel.
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:06.980]   But my concern, at least as of now, is that I don't know how many people who are in
[00:42:06.980 --> 00:42:14.140]   the churches who really know Christ, who really encountered Christ.
[00:42:14.140 --> 00:42:18.220]   I am not talking about people who are attending church regularly, people who go to Bible study,
[00:42:18.220 --> 00:42:19.220]   attend prayer meetings.
[00:42:19.220 --> 00:42:25.180]   I am talking about people who have zeal because they met Christ, the Christ of the Scripture,
[00:42:25.180 --> 00:42:26.860]   and it changed them.
[00:42:26.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   And that is why they are coming to worship God.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:29.860]   That is why they are giving.
[00:42:29.860 --> 00:42:32.740]   That is why they are sacrificing.
[00:42:32.740 --> 00:42:38.220]   The whole nation of Israel completely missed Him.
[00:42:38.220 --> 00:42:49.500]   They are busy sacrificing, proselytizing, making disciples, giving, organizing, and
[00:42:49.500 --> 00:42:57.620]   yet when the author of life was standing right before them, they did not recognize Him.
[00:42:57.620 --> 00:43:02.400]   Let's take the Word of God and take heed.
[00:43:02.400 --> 00:43:04.740]   Come before the Lord.
[00:43:04.740 --> 00:43:09.260]   Search me and know me, see if there are any hurtful ways in me.
[00:43:09.260 --> 00:43:13.120]   Don't just, "Oh, that's not about me."
[00:43:13.120 --> 00:43:14.620]   See if there is any hurtful way in me.
[00:43:14.620 --> 00:43:16.860]   Do I have real faith?
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:19.220]   Do I know this Christ?
[00:43:19.220 --> 00:43:25.620]   Can I say, "I love you, Jesus," and mean it from the bottom of my heart?
[00:43:25.620 --> 00:43:29.300]   Where are you?
[00:43:29.300 --> 00:43:31.220]   This passage is not just for Israel.
[00:43:31.220 --> 00:43:38.460]   It's for every single person who has devoted themselves to religious life superficially,
[00:43:38.460 --> 00:43:47.580]   who are frustrated, and they feel like they are going in circles.
[00:43:47.580 --> 00:43:55.460]   Let's fix our eyes upon Jesus, the only one who is the author and the perfecter of our
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:56.460]   faith.
[00:43:56.460 --> 00:44:03.540]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team comes up.
[00:44:03.540 --> 00:44:11.180]   And I know that some of you may think this is a broken record, and I know because I hear
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:21.120]   it, but I'm also very aware that superficial worship does absolutely nothing other than
[00:44:21.120 --> 00:44:24.180]   make us more deceived.
[00:44:24.180 --> 00:44:30.620]   Let's take some time to come before the Lord and honestly pray that whether we are many
[00:44:30.620 --> 00:44:38.380]   or a few, whether we're by ourselves or whether we're in groups, that what we pursue, what
[00:44:38.380 --> 00:44:43.540]   we give, and the worship that we give is sincere in spirit and in truth.
[00:44:43.540 --> 00:44:45.380]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
