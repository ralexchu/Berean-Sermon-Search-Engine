[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.160]   (audience chattering)
[00:00:03.160 --> 00:00:07.660]   - Hello, hello, okay.
[00:00:07.660 --> 00:00:11.980]   All right, apologies for if you guys didn't get to finish
[00:00:11.980 --> 00:00:14.240]   talking about the passage.
[00:00:14.240 --> 00:00:16.440]   Let's all take a moment to go before the Lord
[00:00:16.440 --> 00:00:20.560]   and ask him to bless our review of the passage.
[00:00:20.560 --> 00:00:26.680]   Heavenly Father, we again want to express our gratitude.
[00:00:26.680 --> 00:00:28.120]   We thank you so much, God,
[00:00:28.120 --> 00:00:32.680]   and we really do pray that as we continue to discuss
[00:00:32.680 --> 00:00:36.460]   and study your word, help us, Father God, to grow.
[00:00:36.460 --> 00:00:38.800]   Lord, I pray that we would, yes,
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:40.540]   grow in knowledge and truth,
[00:00:40.540 --> 00:00:42.560]   but I pray that we would not be those
[00:00:42.560 --> 00:00:46.500]   who are ever growing in simple propositions
[00:00:46.500 --> 00:00:48.340]   and yet not maturing.
[00:00:48.340 --> 00:00:51.880]   I pray, God, that the maturity of our thought,
[00:00:51.880 --> 00:00:55.140]   maturity of our even feelings,
[00:00:55.140 --> 00:00:56.320]   and of course, Lord God,
[00:00:56.320 --> 00:01:00.000]   the maturity of our obedience to you would be growing.
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:03.120]   And God, that as you are guiding us along
[00:01:03.120 --> 00:01:04.720]   in being sanctified,
[00:01:04.720 --> 00:01:07.200]   being conformed to the image of your son,
[00:01:07.200 --> 00:01:09.600]   I ask, God, that you continue to bless our path.
[00:01:09.600 --> 00:01:11.520]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.
[00:01:11.520 --> 00:01:15.320]   Okay, so what I like to do is just begin
[00:01:15.320 --> 00:01:16.780]   by reading our passage.
[00:01:16.780 --> 00:01:22.240]   And so starting from verse three, I'll begin,
[00:01:22.240 --> 00:01:23.840]   and it says, "I thank my God
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   "in all my remembrance of you,
[00:01:26.240 --> 00:01:28.140]   "always offering prayer with joy
[00:01:28.140 --> 00:01:31.660]   "in my every prayer for you all,
[00:01:31.660 --> 00:01:33.940]   "in view of your participation in the gospel
[00:01:33.940 --> 00:01:36.120]   "from the first day until now.
[00:01:36.120 --> 00:01:38.220]   "For I am confident of this very thing,
[00:01:38.220 --> 00:01:40.700]   "that he who began a good work in you
[00:01:40.700 --> 00:01:43.920]   "will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:01:43.920 --> 00:01:45.980]   "For it is only right for me to feel this way
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:49.400]   "about you all, because I have you in my heart.
[00:01:49.400 --> 00:01:51.760]   "Since both in my imprisonment and in the defense
[00:01:51.760 --> 00:01:53.120]   "and confirmation of the gospel,
[00:01:53.120 --> 00:01:56.520]   "you are all partakers of grace with me.
[00:01:56.520 --> 00:01:59.420]   "For God is my witness, how I long for you,
[00:01:59.420 --> 00:02:04.040]   "how I long for you all with the affection of Christ Jesus.
[00:02:04.040 --> 00:02:06.840]   "And this I pray, that your love may abound
[00:02:06.840 --> 00:02:10.260]   "still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[00:02:10.260 --> 00:02:12.960]   "so that you may approve the things that are excellent
[00:02:12.960 --> 00:02:14.900]   "in order to be sincere and blameless
[00:02:14.900 --> 00:02:16.500]   "until the day of Christ,
[00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:18.880]   "having been filled with the fruit of righteousness,
[00:02:18.880 --> 00:02:21.160]   "which comes through Jesus Christ,
[00:02:21.160 --> 00:02:25.040]   "to the glory and praise of God, amen."
[00:02:25.040 --> 00:02:28.160]   Now, I wanna make mention again that because
[00:02:28.160 --> 00:02:30.800]   the purpose of me going over the passage
[00:02:30.800 --> 00:02:32.760]   is to really highlight for you
[00:02:32.760 --> 00:02:35.340]   what are the essential portions,
[00:02:35.340 --> 00:02:37.760]   or I guess the major themes of the passage.
[00:02:37.760 --> 00:02:40.600]   We're not gonna be able to cover every segment,
[00:02:40.600 --> 00:02:42.960]   but those observations are things for you to discuss,
[00:02:42.960 --> 00:02:44.680]   so I hope you guys had a good time
[00:02:44.680 --> 00:02:46.640]   of discussing with each other.
[00:02:46.640 --> 00:02:48.600]   What I'd like to do first is take a moment
[00:02:48.600 --> 00:02:53.600]   to really feel the thrust of this beginning paragraph.
[00:02:53.600 --> 00:02:57.040]   And typically, as Apostle Paul is addressing the church,
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:02:59.960]   he describes and expresses his heart.
[00:02:59.960 --> 00:03:02.720]   And so in this very first section,
[00:03:02.720 --> 00:03:05.400]   I put a line in the paragraph
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.360]   and started to outline, or I guess break down,
[00:03:08.360 --> 00:03:10.500]   the passage into two segments.
[00:03:10.500 --> 00:03:14.160]   The first segment being verses three through eight.
[00:03:14.160 --> 00:03:17.160]   And what I'm gonna do here is every aspect
[00:03:17.160 --> 00:03:20.480]   of what Apostle Paul feels in his heart,
[00:03:20.480 --> 00:03:23.880]   in every aspect of his attitude towards his church,
[00:03:23.880 --> 00:03:26.400]   I wanna make sure to highlight because clearly,
[00:03:26.400 --> 00:03:30.440]   he is expressing very vulnerably and openly
[00:03:30.440 --> 00:03:32.520]   how he feels about this church.
[00:03:32.520 --> 00:03:37.200]   So as I read this, I'm gonna highlight as I go.
[00:03:37.200 --> 00:03:39.000]   Apostle Paul says this.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:43.040]   "I thank my God in all my remembrance of you."
[00:03:43.040 --> 00:03:46.440]   So clearly, he is having this,
[00:03:46.440 --> 00:03:49.440]   you know, I guess you can call it a nostalgic moment.
[00:03:49.440 --> 00:03:52.080]   But he is, again, either chained to a guard
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.400]   or he is in prison.
[00:03:54.400 --> 00:03:56.760]   And as he's thinking about them,
[00:03:56.760 --> 00:03:58.960]   he is incredibly grateful, right?
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:00.280]   He is very thankful.
[00:04:00.280 --> 00:04:03.640]   And then he says, "Always offering prayer with joy."
[00:04:03.640 --> 00:04:06.680]   So he is prayerful and joyful.
[00:04:06.680 --> 00:04:08.760]   "In my every prayer for you all,
[00:04:08.760 --> 00:04:10.800]   "in view of your participation in the gospel
[00:04:10.800 --> 00:04:12.920]   "from the first day until now."
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:15.860]   And then he says, "For I am confident."
[00:04:15.860 --> 00:04:18.720]   So Apostle Paul in his attitude has a great confidence
[00:04:18.720 --> 00:04:20.200]   of this very thing.
[00:04:20.200 --> 00:04:21.040]   What is that?
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:23.200]   "That he who began a good work in you
[00:04:23.200 --> 00:04:26.780]   "will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:04:26.780 --> 00:04:30.640]   "For it is only right for me to feel this way about you."
[00:04:30.640 --> 00:04:33.340]   So what he expresses is this feeling he has
[00:04:33.340 --> 00:04:36.440]   and what that is is I have you in my heart.
[00:04:36.440 --> 00:04:38.000]   "Since both in my imprisonment,
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.600]   "in the defense and confirmation of the gospel,
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:43.640]   "you are all partakers of grace with me.
[00:04:43.640 --> 00:04:46.780]   "For God is my witness how I long for you."
[00:04:46.780 --> 00:04:49.060]   So there he expresses his heart again,
[00:04:49.060 --> 00:04:52.900]   "With the affection of Jesus Christ."
[00:04:52.900 --> 00:04:57.900]   All right, now as we think about this then,
[00:04:57.900 --> 00:05:01.000]   what I highlighted is Apostle Paul's
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:02.620]   heart towards the church.
[00:05:02.620 --> 00:05:04.160]   And that's the first observation
[00:05:04.160 --> 00:05:06.580]   I wanna basically highlight to you.
[00:05:06.580 --> 00:05:08.740]   I'm gonna take a moment to write that down.
[00:05:12.540 --> 00:05:15.960]   Okay, so as we think about this though,
[00:05:15.960 --> 00:05:19.920]   I wanna highlight several aspects of what I notice here.
[00:05:19.920 --> 00:05:22.260]   Just so that we can really learn and glean
[00:05:22.260 --> 00:05:24.420]   from Apostle Paul's mentality,
[00:05:24.420 --> 00:05:27.780]   so that we would also follow in the same mentality.
[00:05:27.780 --> 00:05:32.660]   As I observe this, there is definitely this gratitude,
[00:05:32.660 --> 00:05:35.820]   there is a joy, there is a confidence,
[00:05:35.820 --> 00:05:37.740]   but what he highlights, right,
[00:05:37.740 --> 00:05:39.460]   is his feeling towards them.
[00:05:39.460 --> 00:05:41.460]   And he says, "I have you in my heart.
[00:05:41.460 --> 00:05:44.580]   "I long for you all with the affection of Christ."
[00:05:44.580 --> 00:05:47.500]   So there are a couple things I wanna highlight here, okay,
[00:05:47.500 --> 00:05:48.360]   are these.
[00:05:48.360 --> 00:05:51.860]   I wanna highlight those things.
[00:05:51.860 --> 00:05:54.180]   Now, we could actually spend a lot of time
[00:05:54.180 --> 00:05:56.060]   talking about all of those,
[00:05:56.060 --> 00:05:57.940]   whether it be the feelings of gratitude
[00:05:57.940 --> 00:06:00.220]   or the devotion in prayer, how, you know,
[00:06:00.220 --> 00:06:02.780]   we think about are there people in your life
[00:06:02.780 --> 00:06:04.480]   where you care for them so much
[00:06:04.480 --> 00:06:07.420]   that in terms of everyday prayer,
[00:06:07.420 --> 00:06:10.240]   like those are the individuals that come to mind, right?
[00:06:10.240 --> 00:06:12.060]   The people you love the most,
[00:06:12.060 --> 00:06:14.400]   most often it's probably your family members,
[00:06:14.400 --> 00:06:16.780]   maybe family members who aren't saved or whatnot,
[00:06:16.780 --> 00:06:18.300]   that you pray for often,
[00:06:18.300 --> 00:06:19.900]   that you pray for whenever you get a chance,
[00:06:19.900 --> 00:06:21.700]   when you think about someone to lift up to the Lord,
[00:06:21.700 --> 00:06:23.420]   that's who you go to, right?
[00:06:23.420 --> 00:06:26.240]   Now, as I think about that then,
[00:06:26.240 --> 00:06:28.060]   here's what I would like to say.
[00:06:28.060 --> 00:06:28.900]   Couple things.
[00:06:28.900 --> 00:06:32.780]   One, Apostle Paul has these interesting terminology
[00:06:32.780 --> 00:06:35.740]   where he says, "I long for you," right?
[00:06:35.740 --> 00:06:37.680]   He says, "I long for you."
[00:06:37.680 --> 00:06:40.420]   Now, I kind of mentioned to our group
[00:06:40.420 --> 00:06:42.860]   that's not normal dude talk, right?
[00:06:42.860 --> 00:06:44.180]   When a guy is writing to people,
[00:06:44.180 --> 00:06:47.020]   he doesn't say it like, "I long for you," okay?
[00:06:47.020 --> 00:06:49.580]   Now, it is exactly as that sounds.
[00:06:49.580 --> 00:06:51.820]   In other passages, for example,
[00:06:51.820 --> 00:06:54.280]   within the same book, chapter four, verse one,
[00:06:54.280 --> 00:06:56.300]   Apostle Paul says, "My brethren,
[00:06:56.300 --> 00:07:01.140]   "whom I long to see my joy and crown," right?
[00:07:01.140 --> 00:07:03.460]   He is literally talking about
[00:07:03.460 --> 00:07:05.620]   a strong longing to see somebody.
[00:07:05.620 --> 00:07:08.800]   He misses them, he wants to be in their presence.
[00:07:08.800 --> 00:07:10.780]   That's a really emphatic way of talking about
[00:07:10.780 --> 00:07:13.980]   how he feels about this church.
[00:07:13.980 --> 00:07:17.520]   What's more, he gets really descriptive.
[00:07:17.520 --> 00:07:20.140]   I would like to say he gets super emotional.
[00:07:20.140 --> 00:07:21.700]   Why am I saying that?
[00:07:21.700 --> 00:07:24.360]   Because there's an interesting terminology he uses.
[00:07:24.360 --> 00:07:26.240]   Not only does he say, "I long for you,"
[00:07:26.240 --> 00:07:30.200]   he says, "with the affection of Jesus Christ," okay?
[00:07:30.200 --> 00:07:32.960]   As you guys know, the Greek language
[00:07:32.960 --> 00:07:35.920]   is much more descriptive and also expansive
[00:07:35.920 --> 00:07:37.220]   than the English language.
[00:07:37.220 --> 00:07:39.400]   It has thousands more vocabularies,
[00:07:39.400 --> 00:07:42.880]   so there's different ways of articulating the same thought.
[00:07:42.880 --> 00:07:46.040]   What's very interesting is this idea of affection
[00:07:46.040 --> 00:07:50.680]   literally means the inside organs, the bowels,
[00:07:50.680 --> 00:07:55.520]   the kind of feels that moves the insides, right?
[00:07:55.520 --> 00:07:56.920]   If you were to think about a moment
[00:07:56.920 --> 00:07:58.360]   where there was such emotion,
[00:07:58.360 --> 00:08:01.580]   you literally had a physical response,
[00:08:01.580 --> 00:08:03.160]   whether you were breathing hard,
[00:08:03.160 --> 00:08:05.440]   whether you got hot and you started sweating,
[00:08:05.440 --> 00:08:07.800]   whether you felt like you were gonna vomit, right,
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:09.720]   and your stomach was about to turn,
[00:08:09.720 --> 00:08:11.260]   typically those are the feelings of like
[00:08:11.260 --> 00:08:13.000]   when you get shocked and scared
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:15.640]   and when you get moved because of something you saw.
[00:08:15.640 --> 00:08:20.400]   Here, Paul's talking about his affection,
[00:08:20.400 --> 00:08:22.800]   and then the term is, here, I actually have a
[00:08:22.800 --> 00:08:26.320]   excerpt, okay?
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:27.800]   It's an interesting term.
[00:08:27.800 --> 00:08:30.280]   It's splachnon, okay?
[00:08:30.280 --> 00:08:33.180]   It means the intestines bows, right?
[00:08:33.180 --> 00:08:36.060]   It is this visceral reaction to something.
[00:08:36.060 --> 00:08:37.500]   Now, as we think about that,
[00:08:37.500 --> 00:08:39.380]   I want us to take a moment to think about
[00:08:39.380 --> 00:08:42.480]   the way Apostle Paul is writing to his church.
[00:08:42.480 --> 00:08:46.860]   Man, when he says, when I think of you,
[00:08:46.860 --> 00:08:50.020]   I'm like joyful, I'm thankful.
[00:08:50.020 --> 00:08:52.900]   I want you to see how much he's heightening that.
[00:08:52.900 --> 00:08:54.980]   And then we ask ourselves immediately this question,
[00:08:54.980 --> 00:08:58.540]   oh man, are there people in our lives
[00:08:58.540 --> 00:09:01.820]   whom we want to bless and minister to
[00:09:01.820 --> 00:09:06.700]   where we have that kind of range of emotion, right?
[00:09:06.700 --> 00:09:09.200]   Now, let's take it another step, okay?
[00:09:09.200 --> 00:09:11.820]   If you take a moment to think about
[00:09:11.820 --> 00:09:14.100]   what the way Apostle Paul is describing this,
[00:09:14.100 --> 00:09:16.740]   he says not only does he feel this way,
[00:09:16.740 --> 00:09:20.520]   but he longs for them with the affection of Jesus Christ,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:21.620]   of Christ Jesus.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:25.020]   Now, if you're gonna say something like that,
[00:09:25.020 --> 00:09:26.820]   it's like I love you,
[00:09:26.820 --> 00:09:29.820]   now is he saying the same way Jesus does, right?
[00:09:29.820 --> 00:09:33.300]   That would be crazy because Jesus sacrificed himself.
[00:09:33.300 --> 00:09:35.580]   The depth of his love where he goes
[00:09:35.580 --> 00:09:37.820]   from the heights of heaven to the bottoms,
[00:09:37.820 --> 00:09:40.860]   the earth below, the creation that he made.
[00:09:40.860 --> 00:09:44.980]   How can anyone say I love you the same way, right?
[00:09:44.980 --> 00:09:47.060]   That would be pretty intense.
[00:09:47.060 --> 00:09:50.140]   Now, I don't have the opportunity to ask Apostle Paul,
[00:09:50.140 --> 00:09:52.140]   Paul, what did you mean, right?
[00:09:52.140 --> 00:09:54.900]   But very clearly, with the empowering love
[00:09:54.900 --> 00:09:57.220]   that he knows of Christ,
[00:09:57.220 --> 00:09:59.180]   with the kind of sacrificial,
[00:09:59.180 --> 00:10:01.260]   with the kind of brotherly,
[00:10:01.260 --> 00:10:02.940]   the kind of brotherly where he's willing
[00:10:02.940 --> 00:10:05.360]   to lay down his life for these individuals,
[00:10:05.360 --> 00:10:06.680]   could Apostle Paul say that?
[00:10:06.680 --> 00:10:07.980]   Absolutely.
[00:10:07.980 --> 00:10:09.580]   Think again about where he is.
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:12.780]   Apostle Paul loves these people
[00:10:12.780 --> 00:10:14.740]   with an incredible, incredible love,
[00:10:14.740 --> 00:10:17.580]   and then he heightens that even more, how?
[00:10:17.580 --> 00:10:21.480]   If you notice, he says, "For God is my witness," right?
[00:10:21.480 --> 00:10:24.260]   Have you guys ever done that?
[00:10:25.100 --> 00:10:26.340]   Nobody was questioning him.
[00:10:26.340 --> 00:10:27.180]   Nobody was sitting there like,
[00:10:27.180 --> 00:10:29.380]   "Paul, do you love us?"
[00:10:29.380 --> 00:10:31.880]   At least the Philippians weren't, maybe other people,
[00:10:31.880 --> 00:10:33.380]   but at least the Philippians weren't.
[00:10:33.380 --> 00:10:35.220]   The Philippians actually received this word
[00:10:35.220 --> 00:10:36.140]   from the beginning.
[00:10:36.140 --> 00:10:38.660]   The Philippians actually were really, really receptive
[00:10:38.660 --> 00:10:42.940]   to Apostle Paul, but he says to even heighten the degree
[00:10:42.940 --> 00:10:44.680]   and just expression of his love,
[00:10:44.680 --> 00:10:47.860]   "God is my witness," right?
[00:10:47.860 --> 00:10:50.980]   My conscience is absolutely clear.
[00:10:50.980 --> 00:10:52.420]   I absolutely love you.
[00:10:53.380 --> 00:10:56.900]   Now, not only then does he get emotional,
[00:10:56.900 --> 00:10:59.580]   not only does he long for them,
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:01.220]   in such descriptive ways,
[00:11:01.220 --> 00:11:06.220]   Apostle Paul's heart is deeply, deeply in care,
[00:11:06.220 --> 00:11:09.700]   concern, and love for these people.
[00:11:09.700 --> 00:11:12.900]   And as a quick way of just kind of challenging us,
[00:11:12.900 --> 00:11:17.900]   man, I was thinking, like, man, outside of my family,
[00:11:17.900 --> 00:11:21.580]   outside of my wife, my children,
[00:11:21.580 --> 00:11:23.540]   people who are blood relatives,
[00:11:23.540 --> 00:11:27.140]   do I love people in this fashion?
[00:11:27.140 --> 00:11:29.660]   Where I would devote that kind of extensive time,
[00:11:29.660 --> 00:11:32.100]   that kind of investment in prayer,
[00:11:32.100 --> 00:11:34.700]   where I wouldn't feel crazy awkward saying,
[00:11:34.700 --> 00:11:36.020]   "I miss you, man," you know?
[00:11:36.020 --> 00:11:38.580]   Like, "I wanna see you, it's been too long," you know?
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:43.340]   Like, am I in that kind of an expressive love
[00:11:43.340 --> 00:11:45.140]   to an individual that I could say all of that
[00:11:45.140 --> 00:11:48.140]   and be like, "God is my witness, I love you,
[00:11:48.140 --> 00:11:51.140]   "and look at the degree to which I wanna sacrifice for you."
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:54.620]   And the crazy thing about it is, yeah,
[00:11:54.620 --> 00:11:58.620]   this isn't like his literal children,
[00:11:58.620 --> 00:12:01.140]   these are full-grown adults.
[00:12:01.140 --> 00:12:03.940]   These aren't people that lived 30 years with him,
[00:12:03.940 --> 00:12:06.340]   these are people he spent a season with.
[00:12:06.340 --> 00:12:08.260]   These are people he spent a time with
[00:12:08.260 --> 00:12:10.020]   as he moved along, right?
[00:12:10.020 --> 00:12:14.180]   But remember, the power of the kind of love
[00:12:14.180 --> 00:12:16.300]   that we receive in the gospel,
[00:12:16.300 --> 00:12:20.180]   the kind of divine love we receive through Jesus Christ,
[00:12:20.180 --> 00:12:22.300]   it is so powerful, it is not confined
[00:12:22.300 --> 00:12:26.340]   just because we spent tons of quality time together.
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:29.060]   It is not confined just because we have all kinds
[00:12:29.060 --> 00:12:32.020]   of similarities and same ethnic group
[00:12:32.020 --> 00:12:34.780]   or same demographics and same all of this,
[00:12:34.780 --> 00:12:38.460]   it is superseding all of that, right?
[00:12:38.460 --> 00:12:40.500]   Can two believers come together
[00:12:40.500 --> 00:12:42.940]   and have incredible love for each other,
[00:12:42.940 --> 00:12:44.860]   even in a short amount of time?
[00:12:44.860 --> 00:12:46.860]   Absolutely.
[00:12:46.860 --> 00:12:49.580]   Can two believers come together
[00:12:49.580 --> 00:12:51.860]   and express this kind of love,
[00:12:51.860 --> 00:12:53.500]   even amongst full-grown men
[00:12:53.500 --> 00:12:55.660]   who never ever communicated this way?
[00:12:55.660 --> 00:12:59.020]   Absolutely, right?
[00:12:59.020 --> 00:13:01.460]   And I just wanna challenge every single one of you.
[00:13:01.460 --> 00:13:03.100]   Perhaps you come from backgrounds
[00:13:03.100 --> 00:13:05.660]   that don't practice love like this, you know?
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:08.740]   You never say stuff like, "I miss you,
[00:13:08.740 --> 00:13:10.900]   "I really wanna see you," right?
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:13.300]   Maybe you just never grew up that way,
[00:13:13.300 --> 00:13:15.540]   maybe you just never heard that in your home.
[00:13:16.700 --> 00:13:20.420]   But we're being challenged by Apostle Paul's love
[00:13:20.420 --> 00:13:23.260]   because this is the kind of love God desires
[00:13:23.260 --> 00:13:26.980]   every single one of us to show the people around us,
[00:13:26.980 --> 00:13:30.380]   especially those within our church, okay?
[00:13:30.380 --> 00:13:33.660]   So that's the first observation that I saw.
[00:13:33.660 --> 00:13:36.700]   Man, what an incredible kind of heart
[00:13:36.700 --> 00:13:39.620]   Apostle Paul has for this church.
[00:13:39.620 --> 00:13:43.300]   Okay, oh man, that went kinda long on that one.
[00:13:43.300 --> 00:13:45.780]   All right, observation number two.
[00:13:45.780 --> 00:13:47.900]   Okay, observation number two.
[00:13:47.900 --> 00:13:49.340]   We have to ask this question,
[00:13:49.340 --> 00:13:52.900]   okay, Apostle Paul describes his heart,
[00:13:52.900 --> 00:13:57.580]   but he also describes what he sees within the church, okay?
[00:13:57.580 --> 00:14:00.700]   So my main question really is,
[00:14:00.700 --> 00:14:03.300]   when Apostle Paul says, "I am so thankful
[00:14:03.300 --> 00:14:07.100]   "when I think of you," what is he thinking about?
[00:14:07.100 --> 00:14:10.180]   "I'm so joyous when I pray for you,"
[00:14:10.180 --> 00:14:11.900]   what was he thinking about?
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:13.140]   And he actually says, right?
[00:14:13.140 --> 00:14:14.780]   So I'm gonna read it again,
[00:14:14.780 --> 00:14:16.820]   it's really helpful practice for us
[00:14:16.820 --> 00:14:19.300]   to read the passage over and over again,
[00:14:19.300 --> 00:14:20.900]   to soak in it, right?
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:22.700]   And he says this, "I thank my God
[00:14:22.700 --> 00:14:24.900]   "in all my remembrance of you," okay?
[00:14:24.900 --> 00:14:26.380]   So he's just thinking about the church,
[00:14:26.380 --> 00:14:28.620]   and he says, "Always offering up prayers with joy
[00:14:28.620 --> 00:14:30.580]   "in my prayer for you all."
[00:14:30.580 --> 00:14:32.860]   He's thinking about the whole church,
[00:14:32.860 --> 00:14:35.180]   and then more specifically he says this,
[00:14:35.180 --> 00:14:40.180]   which is the giveaway, "In view of your participation," okay?
[00:14:40.180 --> 00:14:43.700]   So here is a highlight.
[00:14:43.700 --> 00:14:45.060]   Now what's more, it says, "In the gospel
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:46.940]   "from the first day until now,
[00:14:46.940 --> 00:14:49.500]   "I am confident in this very thing,"
[00:14:49.500 --> 00:14:51.580]   what is Apostle Paul thinking about?
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.820]   That there is a good work,
[00:14:53.820 --> 00:14:57.220]   that there is a process that Jesus Christ is working in you,
[00:14:57.220 --> 00:15:00.780]   and he will perfect it until the day of Christ Jesus.
[00:15:00.780 --> 00:15:02.580]   What's more, "It is only right for me
[00:15:02.580 --> 00:15:04.060]   "to feel this way about you all
[00:15:04.060 --> 00:15:06.900]   "because I have you in my heart since,
[00:15:06.900 --> 00:15:10.380]   "both in my imprisonment and in my defense
[00:15:10.380 --> 00:15:12.660]   "and the confirmation of the gospel,
[00:15:12.660 --> 00:15:16.180]   "you are all partakers of grace with me."
[00:15:16.180 --> 00:15:18.060]   So we ask this question,
[00:15:18.060 --> 00:15:22.340]   man, what is causing Apostle Paul to be super thankful?
[00:15:22.340 --> 00:15:26.700]   What is causing Apostle Paul to be super joyful, okay?
[00:15:26.700 --> 00:15:30.860]   And this is my observation too, okay?
[00:15:30.860 --> 00:15:34.100]   Whoops, I put a dot there,
[00:15:34.100 --> 00:15:35.620]   and then didn't really write it down,
[00:15:35.620 --> 00:15:37.100]   just for quick review.
[00:15:37.100 --> 00:15:40.340]   He said, "I long for you," which is one of the thing.
[00:15:40.340 --> 00:15:42.660]   The other thing is his affection,
[00:15:42.660 --> 00:15:48.300]   and then the last thing is of Christ, okay?
[00:15:48.300 --> 00:15:51.820]   But the observation too is what is he looking at,
[00:15:51.820 --> 00:15:54.740]   and very clearly and specifically he says
[00:15:54.740 --> 00:15:58.700]   it is the participation, right?
[00:15:58.700 --> 00:16:02.740]   It is being partakers of the same grace.
[00:16:02.740 --> 00:16:05.100]   This term is koinonia.
[00:16:05.100 --> 00:16:07.660]   This term is fellowship.
[00:16:07.660 --> 00:16:09.580]   When he's thinking about them,
[00:16:09.580 --> 00:16:11.660]   yes, he is absolutely confident
[00:16:11.660 --> 00:16:13.900]   that Jesus is working in them.
[00:16:13.900 --> 00:16:16.620]   Yes, he's absolutely confident that these individuals
[00:16:16.620 --> 00:16:19.980]   are in that faithful, believing process
[00:16:19.980 --> 00:16:22.700]   of being sanctified by Christ,
[00:16:22.700 --> 00:16:27.500]   but what he emphasizes is that there is a fellowship here.
[00:16:27.500 --> 00:16:30.940]   What he emphasizes is that there is a mutual participation
[00:16:30.940 --> 00:16:32.700]   in the gospel ministry,
[00:16:32.700 --> 00:16:37.700]   and what's crazy about that is he calls it grace, right?
[00:16:37.820 --> 00:16:41.580]   His perspective on what they're experiencing together
[00:16:41.580 --> 00:16:44.220]   is a grace toward all of them.
[00:16:44.220 --> 00:16:46.900]   Now, as we think about this then,
[00:16:46.900 --> 00:16:49.940]   I want us to think about this idea.
[00:16:49.940 --> 00:16:54.140]   Is there joy in church fellowship?
[00:16:54.140 --> 00:16:59.340]   Is there joy between the relationships that you have
[00:16:59.340 --> 00:17:02.740]   amongst fellow sisters and fellow brothers in Christ?
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:06.140]   Now, as we think about that question,
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:11.140]   we have to understand that this idea of a mutual feeling,
[00:17:11.140 --> 00:17:14.980]   like we're being blessed,
[00:17:14.980 --> 00:17:16.660]   is currently being experienced
[00:17:16.660 --> 00:17:18.300]   by Apostle Paul and the church.
[00:17:18.300 --> 00:17:19.540]   Why?
[00:17:19.540 --> 00:17:24.540]   Because they're participating in the gospel together, right?
[00:17:24.540 --> 00:17:26.340]   So as we think about this fellowship,
[00:17:26.340 --> 00:17:27.540]   we have to kind of think about
[00:17:27.540 --> 00:17:29.220]   our current state of fellowship
[00:17:29.220 --> 00:17:31.940]   and ask a really important question.
[00:17:31.940 --> 00:17:35.540]   Is the kind of fellowship that we're practicing
[00:17:35.540 --> 00:17:36.500]   watered down?
[00:17:36.500 --> 00:17:39.980]   Is the kind of fellowship that we're practicing
[00:17:39.980 --> 00:17:41.580]   a little distracted?
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.340]   Because if we have a distracted or watered down fellowship,
[00:17:45.340 --> 00:17:49.420]   that means that the degree and the range of joy,
[00:17:49.420 --> 00:17:51.580]   gratitude, and the mutual experience
[00:17:51.580 --> 00:17:54.020]   is also going to be watered down.
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:55.540]   What am I saying?
[00:17:55.540 --> 00:17:58.340]   Apostle Paul's gratitude and thankfulness and joy
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:17:59.820]   is up here right now, right?
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:01.980]   He's like, "Oh, I'm so thankful to God.
[00:18:01.980 --> 00:18:05.300]   "I am praying with joy all the time."
[00:18:05.300 --> 00:18:06.420]   Part of that is why.
[00:18:06.420 --> 00:18:10.300]   It's because of the kind of fellowship
[00:18:10.300 --> 00:18:13.060]   he's having with these brothers and sisters in Christ.
[00:18:13.060 --> 00:18:16.060]   Think about that.
[00:18:16.060 --> 00:18:17.940]   That means if within the church
[00:18:17.940 --> 00:18:20.700]   we're having watered down community time,
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:23.100]   where we're just here in the same place,
[00:18:23.100 --> 00:18:26.100]   but there isn't actually a investment
[00:18:26.100 --> 00:18:28.060]   in the gospel together,
[00:18:28.060 --> 00:18:33.060]   there isn't actually a mutual experience of fellowship,
[00:18:33.100 --> 00:18:35.700]   of working towards exalting Christ,
[00:18:35.700 --> 00:18:39.300]   then honestly speaking, the range of emotions
[00:18:39.300 --> 00:18:42.260]   is also going to be here, right?
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:46.540]   So as we think about this observation number two,
[00:18:46.540 --> 00:18:50.820]   we think about the kind of participation and fellowship has,
[00:18:50.820 --> 00:18:53.260]   and in all honesty, we want that.
[00:18:53.260 --> 00:18:56.180]   We wanna have a kind of fellowship
[00:18:56.180 --> 00:18:59.180]   that produces an incredible amount of encouragement,
[00:18:59.180 --> 00:19:02.060]   that produces incredible amount of thankfulness,
[00:19:02.060 --> 00:19:04.340]   and so we have to ask the question,
[00:19:04.340 --> 00:19:08.460]   are we then participating together in the gospel?
[00:19:08.460 --> 00:19:09.460]   Okay?
[00:19:09.460 --> 00:19:10.540]   All right.
[00:19:10.540 --> 00:19:13.100]   Moving to the third observation.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:13.940]   Oops.
[00:19:13.940 --> 00:19:17.900]   Moving to observation number three.
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:22.180]   What I'd like to observe here
[00:19:22.180 --> 00:19:25.020]   is to move to the next portion of the passage and say,
[00:19:25.020 --> 00:19:27.980]   okay, we've really seen Apostle Paul's heart
[00:19:27.980 --> 00:19:29.620]   and what he's viewing.
[00:19:29.620 --> 00:19:31.700]   Then let's move to the next section
[00:19:31.700 --> 00:19:34.180]   where he is talking about his prayer.
[00:19:34.180 --> 00:19:36.860]   So today, I called it his heart and his prayer,
[00:19:36.860 --> 00:19:39.180]   the two parts of this paragraph.
[00:19:39.180 --> 00:19:41.540]   In verse nine through 11, he says this,
[00:19:41.540 --> 00:19:44.300]   "In this I pray, that your love may abound
[00:19:44.300 --> 00:19:48.220]   "still more and more in real knowledge and all discernment,
[00:19:48.220 --> 00:19:51.160]   "so that you may approve the things that are excellent,
[00:19:51.160 --> 00:19:53.260]   "in order to be sincere and blameless
[00:19:53.260 --> 00:19:55.120]   "until the day of Christ,
[00:19:55.120 --> 00:19:59.020]   "having been filled with the fruit of the righteousness
[00:19:59.020 --> 00:20:00.940]   "which comes through Jesus Christ,
[00:20:00.940 --> 00:20:03.660]   "to the glory and praise of God."
[00:20:03.660 --> 00:20:04.660]   Okay?
[00:20:04.660 --> 00:20:06.180]   There's a lot there,
[00:20:06.180 --> 00:20:09.620]   but we simply just have to ask the question, right?
[00:20:09.620 --> 00:20:13.940]   What's his prayer?
[00:20:13.940 --> 00:20:15.380]   I know sometimes it's just like
[00:20:15.380 --> 00:20:18.540]   a way too obvious of a question, what's there?
[00:20:18.540 --> 00:20:21.340]   But really, we should soak that in, right?
[00:20:21.340 --> 00:20:23.500]   What is he praying for?
[00:20:23.500 --> 00:20:25.080]   And what's really clear and evident
[00:20:25.080 --> 00:20:27.240]   is just simply this fact, number one,
[00:20:27.240 --> 00:20:30.640]   that your love may abound still more
[00:20:30.640 --> 00:20:33.340]   in real knowledge and discernment, okay?
[00:20:33.340 --> 00:20:35.300]   And then it continues to move
[00:20:35.300 --> 00:20:37.580]   in this kind of chain-link fashion
[00:20:37.580 --> 00:20:39.220]   that they may be able to prove,
[00:20:39.220 --> 00:20:41.020]   that they may be sincere and blameless,
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.820]   and that this would all be to the glory and praise of God.
[00:20:44.820 --> 00:20:46.740]   So I'm gonna highlight a couple of those things,
[00:20:46.740 --> 00:20:48.900]   that they may be able to prove,
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:51.540]   they may be sincere and blameless,
[00:20:51.540 --> 00:20:53.100]   or filled with the Spirit,
[00:20:53.100 --> 00:20:56.260]   and then ultimately to the praise and glory of God, okay?
[00:20:56.260 --> 00:20:58.940]   So we're seeing this progressive result
[00:20:58.940 --> 00:21:03.100]   of them growing more and more, okay?
[00:21:03.100 --> 00:21:06.480]   But let's take a moment to think about this.
[00:21:06.480 --> 00:21:10.220]   I hope you guys got a chance to ask this question.
[00:21:10.220 --> 00:21:14.460]   Hmm, what kind of love is this, right?
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:18.420]   Apostle Paul is praying that all these individuals
[00:21:18.420 --> 00:21:21.860]   would be growing even more than where they're at now.
[00:21:21.860 --> 00:21:24.100]   I want you to take a moment to think about that.
[00:21:24.100 --> 00:21:28.380]   These individuals already love to a degree,
[00:21:28.380 --> 00:21:30.700]   but remember 2 Corinthians chapter eight,
[00:21:30.700 --> 00:21:33.980]   they are willing to sacrifice their finances
[00:21:33.980 --> 00:21:36.260]   even beyond what seems natural,
[00:21:36.260 --> 00:21:40.060]   even beyond what seems manageable,
[00:21:40.060 --> 00:21:43.340]   even beyond what seems safe, right?
[00:21:43.340 --> 00:21:46.020]   These are individuals who have participated
[00:21:46.020 --> 00:21:48.100]   by actually sending somebody to make sure
[00:21:48.100 --> 00:21:51.500]   that they're caring for Apostle Paul.
[00:21:51.500 --> 00:21:56.500]   What's more, while Apostle Paul was ministering in Philippi,
[00:21:56.840 --> 00:22:01.580]   it's safe to assume that individuals from this church now,
[00:22:01.580 --> 00:22:03.600]   the people who are hearing the gospel,
[00:22:03.600 --> 00:22:05.840]   they weren't afraid to associate with him.
[00:22:05.840 --> 00:22:08.440]   They weren't thinking, oh shoot, look, he's getting arrested.
[00:22:08.440 --> 00:22:11.000]   Hey, hey, just stay quiet, right?
[00:22:11.000 --> 00:22:12.940]   Some of them were calling to say, hey, wait a minute,
[00:22:12.940 --> 00:22:15.440]   we're with that guy, you know?
[00:22:15.440 --> 00:22:16.960]   I'm kind of reading between the lines here,
[00:22:16.960 --> 00:22:20.120]   but I'm assuming they weren't just stiff-arming him
[00:22:20.120 --> 00:22:22.400]   and pushing him off and pushing him off to a degree
[00:22:22.400 --> 00:22:24.220]   and just watching from a safe distance
[00:22:24.220 --> 00:22:28.020]   when Apostle Paul says, you are partakers with me, right?
[00:22:28.020 --> 00:22:31.020]   Okay, what I'm saying is these are individuals
[00:22:31.020 --> 00:22:35.220]   who already had a certain level of commitment and devotion
[00:22:35.220 --> 00:22:37.640]   that showed their love for Apostle Paul
[00:22:37.640 --> 00:22:39.100]   and ultimately for God.
[00:22:39.100 --> 00:22:45.260]   Now, Apostle Paul says, I want you to grow even more, right?
[00:22:45.260 --> 00:22:47.740]   I want you to grow even more.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:49.580]   So we think about this,
[00:22:49.580 --> 00:22:52.740]   and I kind of want to highlight this idea.
[00:22:53.620 --> 00:22:57.180]   Apostle Paul said, I am really, really confident
[00:22:57.180 --> 00:22:58.980]   and convinced of this.
[00:22:58.980 --> 00:23:01.260]   Clearly, Christ is working in you,
[00:23:01.260 --> 00:23:04.300]   and I am confident that he's going to bring it to completion.
[00:23:04.300 --> 00:23:08.800]   Apostle Paul all the more desires
[00:23:08.800 --> 00:23:10.920]   that even if they're a healthy church,
[00:23:10.920 --> 00:23:13.860]   even if they're showing fruits of the Spirit,
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.820]   that they need to dig deeper and grow even more.
[00:23:17.820 --> 00:23:21.540]   He is encouraging a church that has good qualities already,
[00:23:21.540 --> 00:23:23.700]   but he's saying, remember,
[00:23:23.700 --> 00:23:26.060]   our standard is not better than others.
[00:23:26.060 --> 00:23:29.140]   Our standard is not simply better than I was before.
[00:23:29.140 --> 00:23:33.060]   Our standard is the full measure of Christ.
[00:23:33.060 --> 00:23:35.140]   And if you guys remember in the book of Colossians,
[00:23:35.140 --> 00:23:38.420]   when Apostle Paul talks about his vision for that church,
[00:23:38.420 --> 00:23:42.540]   he said, I devote myself to teaching, admonishing,
[00:23:42.540 --> 00:23:45.340]   every single individual, constantly teaching about Christ
[00:23:45.340 --> 00:23:49.060]   to present you complete in Christ,
[00:23:49.060 --> 00:23:51.520]   that the image of Christ will be perfected in you.
[00:23:51.520 --> 00:23:55.320]   And I want to make a quick challenge to you.
[00:23:55.320 --> 00:23:57.900]   When you hear the Bible tell you,
[00:23:57.900 --> 00:24:01.100]   still, more and more,
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:03.540]   I want you to abound even more,
[00:24:03.540 --> 00:24:06.460]   how do you receive that?
[00:24:06.460 --> 00:24:08.440]   For those of you who are already working hard,
[00:24:08.440 --> 00:24:12.100]   serving hard, loving, how do you receive that?
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.860]   Do you think like, yeah, man,
[00:24:14.860 --> 00:24:17.300]   you need to go and do this, you know?
[00:24:17.300 --> 00:24:19.140]   Are you immediately thinking about the people
[00:24:19.140 --> 00:24:20.820]   who need to hear it, or are you receiving it
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.460]   as a convicting passage for you?
[00:24:23.460 --> 00:24:27.380]   That even though you are already laboring,
[00:24:27.380 --> 00:24:30.700]   that God desires for you to grow even more.
[00:24:30.700 --> 00:24:32.980]   And what's very interesting about this, he says,
[00:24:32.980 --> 00:24:37.980]   I want you to grow in love, and the term there is agape.
[00:24:37.980 --> 00:24:40.900]   I want you to grow in that kind of relational,
[00:24:40.900 --> 00:24:43.620]   covenantal, unconditional love,
[00:24:43.620 --> 00:24:47.660]   which is the distinguishing mark of a true believer.
[00:24:47.660 --> 00:24:52.140]   Remember that if a Christian, if we were to think,
[00:24:52.140 --> 00:24:54.040]   what do we have to offer to the world?
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:57.140]   What do we have to give?
[00:24:57.140 --> 00:24:58.780]   If you're sitting there thinking,
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:00.620]   I don't know, I've got no skills,
[00:25:00.620 --> 00:25:02.180]   we're talking about serving,
[00:25:02.180 --> 00:25:03.740]   and we're talking about loving and stuff,
[00:25:03.740 --> 00:25:05.980]   I'm just, I don't know what I've got to give.
[00:25:05.980 --> 00:25:11.020]   Remember that we, by nature of our salvation,
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:13.460]   and the love that we receive from God,
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:17.540]   have something so divinely powerful,
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:21.460]   it radically, radically changes who we are, right?
[00:25:21.460 --> 00:25:24.700]   And scripture says this is the defining thing about you.
[00:25:24.700 --> 00:25:27.700]   How do you know that you have passed from death to life?
[00:25:27.700 --> 00:25:29.860]   Because you have love for the brethren.
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:32.220]   How does the world know that you are a Christian
[00:25:32.220 --> 00:25:33.380]   and a disciple of Christ?
[00:25:33.380 --> 00:25:35.380]   Because you love the brethren.
[00:25:35.380 --> 00:25:38.000]   This is the defining mark of a believer.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:42.700]   So, I want to ask, for you,
[00:25:42.700 --> 00:25:46.700]   when you think about your love for the people around you,
[00:25:46.700 --> 00:25:52.420]   have you fallen into the generational standard
[00:25:52.420 --> 00:25:53.860]   of what's normal?
[00:25:53.860 --> 00:25:55.240]   What do I mean by that?
[00:25:55.240 --> 00:25:57.420]   I believe we live, I'm sorry,
[00:25:57.420 --> 00:26:02.420]   I believe that we live in a very safe distance environment.
[00:26:02.420 --> 00:26:04.500]   Right?
[00:26:04.500 --> 00:26:06.640]   We don't want people to call us anymore, why?
[00:26:06.640 --> 00:26:08.740]   Because I gotta have time to think about
[00:26:08.740 --> 00:26:10.460]   what I want to say, right?
[00:26:10.460 --> 00:26:12.100]   I don't want to be too invasive.
[00:26:12.900 --> 00:26:16.420]   We kind of live in a safe distance environment
[00:26:16.420 --> 00:26:20.180]   where we don't let people that close, right?
[00:26:20.180 --> 00:26:22.020]   The kind of love that we practice,
[00:26:22.020 --> 00:26:25.380]   we want to practice where we have control
[00:26:25.380 --> 00:26:27.380]   over how vulnerable we are.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:29.440]   The kind of love that this generation practice
[00:26:29.440 --> 00:26:33.900]   is a very digital, like I want to be able to say,
[00:26:33.900 --> 00:26:35.740]   I want to be able to see what you're doing,
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:38.140]   da da da da da, but at a safe distance.
[00:26:38.140 --> 00:26:39.940]   You guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:26:41.220 --> 00:26:42.740]   Have you settled for that?
[00:26:42.740 --> 00:26:46.060]   And the love for the people around you,
[00:26:46.060 --> 00:26:47.860]   are you just so afraid of awkwardness?
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:49.820]   Are you so afraid of getting into certain things
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:52.060]   that you don't want to get into?
[00:26:52.060 --> 00:26:55.100]   Or are you going to practice the love
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:57.860]   that you see the disciples practicing,
[00:26:57.860 --> 00:27:01.720]   the apostles practicing, and our Lord Jesus Christ?
[00:27:01.720 --> 00:27:06.220]   So, with that said, I do want to highlight
[00:27:06.220 --> 00:27:07.980]   one more thing, which is this.
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:11.660]   Apostle Paul describes this love
[00:27:11.660 --> 00:27:15.380]   in a context that's kind of unique, right?
[00:27:15.380 --> 00:27:18.260]   He not only says, I want you to abound
[00:27:18.260 --> 00:27:20.420]   in this love still more and more,
[00:27:20.420 --> 00:27:24.580]   he says, he says, in all, sorry,
[00:27:24.580 --> 00:27:28.380]   in real knowledge and all discernment, right?
[00:27:28.380 --> 00:27:31.140]   Did you guys talk a little bit about what does that mean?
[00:27:31.140 --> 00:27:35.500]   How does love, this agape love, knowledge and truth,
[00:27:35.500 --> 00:27:38.820]   and discernment all kind of mesh together?
[00:27:38.820 --> 00:27:40.460]   How does it plan to each other, right?
[00:27:40.460 --> 00:27:42.940]   Which is a good question to ask.
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:45.300]   I want us to think about this a little bit.
[00:27:45.300 --> 00:27:49.740]   What would happen if your love didn't have real knowledge?
[00:27:49.740 --> 00:27:53.140]   If it didn't have as its agenda, truth?
[00:27:53.140 --> 00:27:55.860]   If it didn't have as its agenda, reality?
[00:27:55.860 --> 00:27:58.040]   What if your love didn't have discernment?
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:00.380]   What if it didn't have discretion of this is righteous,
[00:28:00.380 --> 00:28:03.080]   this is bad, this is healthy, this is not?
[00:28:03.080 --> 00:28:05.420]   What would happen, right?
[00:28:05.420 --> 00:28:08.620]   Well, if you take a moment to think about it,
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.180]   love absolutely operates in the context of truth,
[00:28:13.180 --> 00:28:15.420]   and it needs, it needs to operate
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:17.700]   in the righteousness of God, why?
[00:28:17.700 --> 00:28:19.300]   Because love without those things
[00:28:19.300 --> 00:28:22.580]   would simply be uncontrolled emotion.
[00:28:22.580 --> 00:28:24.620]   It would be impulse and reactions
[00:28:24.620 --> 00:28:26.220]   to the things that you see.
[00:28:26.220 --> 00:28:28.500]   And in a most perverted way,
[00:28:28.500 --> 00:28:31.780]   love that does not have as its context
[00:28:31.780 --> 00:28:33.900]   the righteousness of God, the truth of the Lord,
[00:28:33.900 --> 00:28:37.600]   or the reality and discernment of what is pleasing to God,
[00:28:37.600 --> 00:28:41.140]   would be adultery, right?
[00:28:41.140 --> 00:28:45.020]   An individual who is given to loving,
[00:28:45.020 --> 00:28:50.020]   wanting, desiring, affection without truth
[00:28:50.020 --> 00:28:52.300]   is going to be the individual who says,
[00:28:52.300 --> 00:28:54.260]   "But I love her, but I love him,"
[00:28:54.260 --> 00:28:58.160]   even besides all the truth and standards of God, right?
[00:28:58.160 --> 00:28:59.780]   An individual who has that kind of love
[00:28:59.780 --> 00:29:04.780]   can be perverted in all sorts of different fashion.
[00:29:04.780 --> 00:29:07.300]   What's more, on the flip side,
[00:29:07.300 --> 00:29:09.820]   it could lead to absolute domination.
[00:29:09.820 --> 00:29:11.420]   Love's supposed to be action.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:14.140]   Love's supposed to be, "I do what's in your best interest."
[00:29:14.140 --> 00:29:16.580]   So you grab the back of their neck and you say, "Do it!"
[00:29:16.580 --> 00:29:17.580]   Right?
[00:29:17.580 --> 00:29:19.340]   And some people think that's love.
[00:29:19.340 --> 00:29:25.580]   If love does not have reality, discretion, truth of God,
[00:29:25.580 --> 00:29:29.580]   and it's not pursuing the righteousness of the Lord,
[00:29:29.580 --> 00:29:31.580]   it's gonna fall to those two extremes,
[00:29:31.580 --> 00:29:34.700]   absolute perversion and some kind of permissiveness
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.940]   that leads to all kinds of unrighteousness,
[00:29:36.940 --> 00:29:39.460]   or it's going to lead to domination.
[00:29:39.460 --> 00:29:41.380]   This is good for you, right?
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:44.700]   So what Apostle Paul says is,
[00:29:44.700 --> 00:29:47.340]   "Your love needs to abound
[00:29:47.340 --> 00:29:50.260]   "in real knowledge and all discernment."
[00:29:50.260 --> 00:29:52.200]   This world will say, "You know what?
[00:29:52.200 --> 00:29:54.100]   "Love is blind."
[00:29:54.100 --> 00:29:55.460]   False, right?
[00:29:55.460 --> 00:29:57.340]   Well, but we know what they're saying.
[00:29:57.340 --> 00:29:58.340]   Love is not blind.
[00:29:58.340 --> 00:30:00.900]   As a matter of fact, love sees everything.
[00:30:00.900 --> 00:30:05.880]   Love, and I want to just take a moment to describe this.
[00:30:05.880 --> 00:30:08.900]   Love cares enough to perceive.
[00:30:08.900 --> 00:30:12.260]   Love cares enough to perceive where you're wrong.
[00:30:12.260 --> 00:30:14.580]   Love cares enough to perceive where you're in need.
[00:30:14.580 --> 00:30:16.860]   Love cares enough to perceive where you're hurt.
[00:30:16.860 --> 00:30:20.940]   Love should be the most informed, the most understanding,
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:24.380]   the most perceptive of all things, right?
[00:30:24.380 --> 00:30:27.580]   And ladies, you can speak to this, right?
[00:30:27.580 --> 00:30:30.900]   Ladies, if you guys have ever been into a relationship
[00:30:30.900 --> 00:30:33.500]   and your guy is very, you know,
[00:30:33.500 --> 00:30:35.560]   doesn't have that kind of sense,
[00:30:35.560 --> 00:30:39.600]   doesn't have that kind of intuition,
[00:30:39.600 --> 00:30:41.240]   and they can't tell whether you're upset,
[00:30:41.240 --> 00:30:42.480]   they can't tell whether you're happy,
[00:30:42.480 --> 00:30:43.560]   they can't tell whether you're mad.
[00:30:43.560 --> 00:30:44.680]   They're like, "Everything's cool, right?"
[00:30:44.680 --> 00:30:47.840]   And you're just like, "Do you even care?"
[00:30:47.840 --> 00:30:50.040]   No, you guys have never felt that way?
[00:30:50.040 --> 00:30:52.720]   Of course you have, to some degree.
[00:30:52.720 --> 00:30:53.680]   Why?
[00:30:53.680 --> 00:30:56.400]   Because yes, true love will know.
[00:30:56.400 --> 00:30:59.880]   Doesn't have the same kind of ring to it
[00:30:59.880 --> 00:31:02.760]   when the world says, "Love is blind."
[00:31:02.760 --> 00:31:06.160]   Okay, that sounds great, but as a matter of fact,
[00:31:06.160 --> 00:31:08.680]   no, love is most perceptive.
[00:31:08.680 --> 00:31:10.260]   And this past weekend, if you guys were here
[00:31:10.260 --> 00:31:12.800]   for Pastor Peter's sermon, oh my gosh,
[00:31:12.800 --> 00:31:13.680]   it just like killed me.
[00:31:13.680 --> 00:31:16.160]   I was just sitting there crying because,
[00:31:16.160 --> 00:31:18.260]   think about that.
[00:31:18.260 --> 00:31:20.280]   Think about the love of God.
[00:31:20.280 --> 00:31:24.640]   The love of God that sympathizes with you.
[00:31:24.640 --> 00:31:28.820]   Just take a moment to think about that.
[00:31:28.820 --> 00:31:31.600]   The love of God is not blind to you.
[00:31:31.600 --> 00:31:32.960]   The love of God is like, "You know what?
[00:31:32.960 --> 00:31:33.880]   "I just don't care."
[00:31:33.880 --> 00:31:37.280]   No, he sees all of it.
[00:31:37.280 --> 00:31:40.040]   He sees the filth, he sees the anger, the sin,
[00:31:40.040 --> 00:31:41.680]   he sees all of it.
[00:31:41.680 --> 00:31:45.640]   And then he loves you and then cares
[00:31:45.640 --> 00:31:49.160]   to that meticulous, detailed fashion
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:52.880]   to address every single need you have
[00:31:52.880 --> 00:31:56.080]   through the amazing power of the love of Christ.
[00:31:56.080 --> 00:31:58.720]   And then what's more, the love of God
[00:31:58.720 --> 00:32:00.300]   does not just simply leave it there,
[00:32:00.300 --> 00:32:02.240]   but the love of God is sanctifying.
[00:32:02.240 --> 00:32:07.160]   The love of God that doesn't say, "I feel you, man,"
[00:32:07.160 --> 00:32:08.400]   and then all of a sudden you feel bitter.
[00:32:08.400 --> 00:32:11.760]   No, the love of God walks into your life
[00:32:11.760 --> 00:32:15.600]   and it washes you, it sanctifies you.
[00:32:15.600 --> 00:32:17.280]   And so I wanna read to you a passage,
[00:32:17.280 --> 00:32:18.640]   one of the passages that hit me
[00:32:18.640 --> 00:32:21.280]   from the last session of Colossians,
[00:32:21.280 --> 00:32:25.320]   was he said this, Colossians chapter 1, 21 through 22.
[00:32:25.320 --> 00:32:27.480]   Colossians 1, 21 through 22.
[00:32:27.480 --> 00:32:30.700]   And although you were formerly alienated,
[00:32:30.700 --> 00:32:32.980]   you were hostile in your mind,
[00:32:32.980 --> 00:32:35.340]   you were engaged in evil deeds,
[00:32:35.340 --> 00:32:37.180]   yet he has now reconciled you
[00:32:37.180 --> 00:32:39.940]   in his fleshly body through death.
[00:32:39.940 --> 00:32:41.220]   It doesn't stop there.
[00:32:41.220 --> 00:32:44.620]   He says, "In order to present you before him
[00:32:44.620 --> 00:32:49.020]   "wholly blameless and beyond reproach."
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.960]   Oh my goodness.
[00:32:51.960 --> 00:32:55.240]   The amazing love of God.
[00:32:56.260 --> 00:32:59.600]   Just simply for him to listen to us
[00:32:59.600 --> 00:33:01.740]   would be grace upon grace.
[00:33:01.740 --> 00:33:04.460]   But for him to step down and walk our place,
[00:33:04.460 --> 00:33:07.380]   for him to step down and sympathize and empathize with us,
[00:33:07.380 --> 00:33:10.120]   that's grace upon grace upon grace.
[00:33:10.120 --> 00:33:14.300]   But then to desire to make us wholly blameless
[00:33:14.300 --> 00:33:15.560]   and beyond reproach.
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:17.980]   We can't even describe that.
[00:33:17.980 --> 00:33:22.300]   The intention and love of God.
[00:33:22.300 --> 00:33:27.300]   And so, as we follow in the likeness of Christ
[00:33:27.300 --> 00:33:30.540]   and abound in that kind of love,
[00:33:30.540 --> 00:33:33.280]   we're going to be all the more godly, righteous,
[00:33:33.280 --> 00:33:35.460]   conformed to the image of his son.
[00:33:35.460 --> 00:33:37.900]   And that's going to be glorifying to him, amen?
[00:33:37.900 --> 00:33:41.860]   All right, so today we highlighted,
[00:33:41.860 --> 00:33:44.660]   A, we have Apostle Paul's heart
[00:33:44.660 --> 00:33:47.100]   and expressed love and concern,
[00:33:47.100 --> 00:33:49.260]   thankfulness and joy over this church
[00:33:49.260 --> 00:33:51.500]   that he just sees this like precious,
[00:33:51.500 --> 00:33:53.580]   precious baby of his, right?
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.220]   And then we see his prayer.
[00:33:55.220 --> 00:33:56.740]   I am praying for you,
[00:33:56.740 --> 00:33:58.900]   not that none of this stuff happens to you.
[00:33:58.900 --> 00:34:01.140]   I'm not praying that you would run away
[00:34:01.140 --> 00:34:02.660]   and not be jailed like me.
[00:34:02.660 --> 00:34:05.300]   I'm not asking for all your circumstances to work out.
[00:34:05.300 --> 00:34:08.420]   I'm not asking for a hedge of protection around you, right?
[00:34:08.420 --> 00:34:11.020]   I am praying for your faith,
[00:34:11.020 --> 00:34:13.220]   for your love to abound,
[00:34:13.220 --> 00:34:17.900]   for you to glorify God by loving like he does, amen?
[00:34:17.900 --> 00:34:19.540]   All right, let's take a moment to pray
[00:34:19.540 --> 00:34:21.940]   and then we can jump into our application time.
[00:34:21.940 --> 00:34:26.020]   Lord God, we want to thank you.
[00:34:26.020 --> 00:34:31.540]   Father, we know that your love
[00:34:31.540 --> 00:34:35.340]   goes so much beyond just this period of time
[00:34:35.340 --> 00:34:37.900]   and it goes so much beyond our period of time.
[00:34:37.900 --> 00:34:42.820]   Father God, your love has extended
[00:34:42.820 --> 00:34:45.300]   throughout the generations of your people
[00:34:45.300 --> 00:34:47.420]   and through the generations of your people,
[00:34:47.420 --> 00:34:49.180]   you have sent your messengers,
[00:34:49.180 --> 00:34:52.420]   you have sent the revelation of who you are.
[00:34:52.420 --> 00:34:55.380]   And now, Father God, for us, we're privileged
[00:34:55.380 --> 00:35:00.380]   because Lord, we can see this in your son,
[00:35:00.380 --> 00:35:04.700]   in your truth, that God, your love is truly poured out
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:06.020]   upon us.
[00:35:06.020 --> 00:35:09.700]   I pray, Father God, that we would respond to you
[00:35:09.700 --> 00:35:12.540]   with great thankfulness and joy likewise
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:15.980]   and God, that we would all the more be so eager,
[00:35:15.980 --> 00:35:18.420]   Lord, to grow as you want us to.
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:20.960]   That Father God, we would not ask you to settle
[00:35:20.960 --> 00:35:23.500]   for whatever we're already doing.
[00:35:23.500 --> 00:35:24.900]   We would not ask you to settle
[00:35:24.900 --> 00:35:27.500]   for what's normal to our society,
[00:35:27.500 --> 00:35:30.880]   but God, that we would be fully, fully thankful.
[00:35:30.880 --> 00:35:32.580]   Lord, that you would cause us to grow
[00:35:32.580 --> 00:35:35.020]   and that you would complete your process, Lord.
[00:35:35.020 --> 00:35:36.500]   We want to thank you again, it's in Christ.
[00:35:36.500 --> 00:35:37.620]   In you pray, amen.
[00:35:37.620 --> 00:35:40.620]   Thanks for watching!
