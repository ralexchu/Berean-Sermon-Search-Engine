[00:07:52.140 --> 00:07:53.380]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:07:53.380 --> 00:07:55.580]   Hope you had a wonderful Christmas,
[00:07:55.580 --> 00:07:57.080]   celebrating the birth and the gift
[00:07:57.080 --> 00:07:59.640]   that that is our savior, Jesus Christ.
[00:07:59.640 --> 00:08:01.280]   And as this year comes to a close,
[00:08:01.280 --> 00:08:04.920]   let us worship our God for his unending faithfulness to us
[00:08:04.920 --> 00:08:07.980]   and his sufficient grace.
[00:08:07.980 --> 00:08:09.440]   I'm sure that this year,
[00:08:09.440 --> 00:08:11.680]   we've all experienced some form of hardship,
[00:08:11.680 --> 00:08:15.400]   of loss, of suffering.
[00:08:15.400 --> 00:08:18.640]   Yet our hope remains that even in the darkest of storms,
[00:08:18.640 --> 00:08:21.600]   our God is faithful and that he strengthens
[00:08:21.600 --> 00:08:23.000]   and protects us from the evil one
[00:08:23.000 --> 00:08:27.200]   as it's promised to us in 2 Thessalonians 3, 3.
[00:08:27.200 --> 00:08:29.800]   So this morning, would you join us to worship
[00:08:29.800 --> 00:08:32.040]   and to sing joyfully to our God,
[00:08:32.040 --> 00:08:34.040]   great is thy faithfulness.

[00:12:55.100 --> 00:13:04.900]   - Good morning, everybody.
[00:13:04.900 --> 00:13:07.340]   I wanna welcome you to this morning's service.
[00:13:07.340 --> 00:13:09.660]   We do have a good number of announcements
[00:13:09.660 --> 00:13:11.940]   and important announcements at that.
[00:13:11.940 --> 00:13:14.580]   The first is what we have been preparing for
[00:13:14.580 --> 00:13:18.540]   and announcing is gonna go into effect next week.
[00:13:18.540 --> 00:13:21.140]   So please make sure you keep in mind
[00:13:21.140 --> 00:13:24.460]   the scheduled times for our three services.
[00:13:24.460 --> 00:13:29.140]   It's going to be 8 a.m., 9.30, and 11.30 a.m.
[00:13:29.140 --> 00:13:32.220]   Please also make sure, just as it is the first week,
[00:13:32.220 --> 00:13:35.020]   we typically try and come to prepare our hearts
[00:13:35.020 --> 00:13:36.980]   by praying for about 10 minutes or so
[00:13:36.980 --> 00:13:38.620]   prior to the service.
[00:13:38.620 --> 00:13:42.180]   So keep that in mind and then come ready to worship.
[00:13:42.180 --> 00:13:46.100]   As a reminder, our Children's Ministry Seeds
[00:13:46.100 --> 00:13:49.580]   and then Sprouts K through 2nd will be 9.30
[00:13:49.580 --> 00:13:51.980]   and then all the grades for Education Department
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:56.020]   will be available at the 11.30 service, okay?
[00:13:56.020 --> 00:14:00.020]   With that said, today is going to be a full day.
[00:14:00.020 --> 00:14:02.100]   The church essentially will be kind of open
[00:14:02.100 --> 00:14:03.840]   throughout the entirety of the day.
[00:14:03.840 --> 00:14:05.740]   There is gonna be a ping pong tournament
[00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.980]   and you are allowed to come and spectate and watch as well.
[00:14:08.980 --> 00:14:13.180]   And then our service in the evening will be 11 p.m. sharp.
[00:14:13.180 --> 00:14:15.860]   So please make sure to come ready.
[00:14:15.860 --> 00:14:18.260]   We'll be worshiping, hearing Pastor Peter Kim
[00:14:18.260 --> 00:14:21.020]   deliver the word from the scripture,
[00:14:21.020 --> 00:14:23.300]   and we'll also watch an end-of-the-year video.
[00:14:23.300 --> 00:14:25.800]   It's a special video that the media team is preparing.
[00:14:25.800 --> 00:14:28.200]   So please make sure to all attend that.
[00:14:28.200 --> 00:14:31.900]   The other announcement is for our membership class
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.240]   which is starting soon on January 14th.
[00:14:35.240 --> 00:14:37.160]   If you are newer to the church
[00:14:37.160 --> 00:14:38.520]   and you wanna become a member,
[00:14:38.520 --> 00:14:40.360]   please sign up for this class.
[00:14:40.360 --> 00:14:42.740]   It's eight weeks long covering the foundations
[00:14:42.740 --> 00:14:44.160]   of the Christian faith,
[00:14:44.160 --> 00:14:47.000]   but also covering the core doctrines that build this church
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:49.240]   and why we do ministry the way we do.
[00:14:49.240 --> 00:14:51.640]   You can sign up for that by visiting our website.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:53.680]   You can even visit the welcome booth.
[00:14:53.680 --> 00:14:56.560]   Our welcome members will be able to just direct you
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:58.680]   to sign up for that link.
[00:14:58.680 --> 00:15:00.500]   And then for all the members,
[00:15:00.500 --> 00:15:03.900]   we have a mandatory meeting Sunday afternoon
[00:15:03.900 --> 00:15:05.900]   on January 14th.
[00:15:05.900 --> 00:15:08.020]   If you aren't able to participate,
[00:15:08.020 --> 00:15:10.940]   there is going to be a email,
[00:15:10.940 --> 00:15:12.580]   bereanmembers@gmail.com.
[00:15:12.580 --> 00:15:15.380]   That's also on our app and website as well.
[00:15:15.380 --> 00:15:17.820]   You can notify us of your absence.
[00:15:17.820 --> 00:15:20.540]   And the final thing I wanna highlight to you
[00:15:20.540 --> 00:15:24.240]   is that the Jubilee ministry is gonna kick off
[00:15:24.240 --> 00:15:25.980]   a Bible reading fellowship.
[00:15:25.980 --> 00:15:27.180]   So for those of you who don't know,
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:31.420]   again, the Jubilee fellowship is for those 50 years and over
[00:15:31.420 --> 00:15:34.860]   and this is gonna be starting from the 1st of February
[00:15:34.860 --> 00:15:37.300]   to read through the Gospels together,
[00:15:37.300 --> 00:15:39.260]   fellowshipping going hand-in-hand that way,
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:42.100]   reading through the Gospels as a way to encourage
[00:15:42.100 --> 00:15:43.580]   and keep each other accountable.
[00:15:43.580 --> 00:15:46.020]   The sign-up link, again, is on the app and website.
[00:15:46.020 --> 00:15:48.100]   If you have any questions about that,
[00:15:48.100 --> 00:15:49.900]   you can message Elder Philip.
[00:15:49.900 --> 00:15:52.900]   Okay, well with that said,
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:54.980]   this morning we have the privilege of hearing
[00:15:54.980 --> 00:15:57.980]   the testimony of our brother Brian Kim
[00:15:57.980 --> 00:15:59.500]   after the worship set.
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.380]   We'll now enter into time of offering.
[00:16:01.380 --> 00:16:03.740]   So again, if you have a physical check,
[00:16:03.740 --> 00:16:05.980]   there is a dropbox there by the entrance
[00:16:05.980 --> 00:16:07.540]   that you can submit it there
[00:16:07.540 --> 00:16:09.760]   or you can submit it through the digital form.
[00:16:09.760 --> 00:16:11.400]   Let's bow together in prayer.
[00:16:11.400 --> 00:16:18.940]   Heavenly Father, we are so grateful to you
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.680]   as we come to this service at the end of the year.
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:24.700]   Our hearts are filled with gratitude
[00:16:24.700 --> 00:16:27.740]   for all the ways that you have given to us,
[00:16:27.740 --> 00:16:31.020]   provided for us, held us, encouraged us,
[00:16:31.020 --> 00:16:33.260]   and led us through the entirety of the year
[00:16:33.260 --> 00:16:35.340]   and we wanna give you thanks.
[00:16:35.340 --> 00:16:36.980]   And Lord, as we worship today,
[00:16:36.980 --> 00:16:39.140]   may our hearts then be filled with gratitude
[00:16:39.140 --> 00:16:41.460]   to lift to you on high
[00:16:41.460 --> 00:16:43.700]   and also as we give our offering,
[00:16:43.700 --> 00:16:45.460]   let our attitude be the same,
[00:16:45.460 --> 00:16:49.500]   expressing to you just our sweet, sweet appreciation
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:51.020]   for your love and care.
[00:16:51.020 --> 00:16:52.800]   And I pray, Father, that more and more
[00:16:52.800 --> 00:16:56.240]   as we render to you our service and our worship,
[00:16:56.240 --> 00:16:58.720]   our heart's desire is to express, God,
[00:16:58.720 --> 00:17:01.840]   that we wanna be for you to your good pleasure,
[00:17:01.840 --> 00:17:04.500]   to the work of your kingdom and your glory.
[00:17:04.500 --> 00:17:06.400]   We thank you for this service, Lord,
[00:17:06.400 --> 00:17:09.600]   and we pray, God, that as we hear your word,
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:11.760]   as we sing the worship songs,
[00:17:11.760 --> 00:17:13.180]   and even as we give,
[00:17:13.180 --> 00:17:15.040]   this would all turn to you in praise and glory.
[00:17:15.040 --> 00:17:16.860]   We thank you in Christ's name, amen.

[00:26:59.060 --> 00:27:01.640]   (gong ringing)
[00:27:01.640 --> 00:27:21.580]   - Good morning, or good afternoon, almost.
[00:27:21.580 --> 00:27:24.900]   I was born into a home where my parents were Christian.
[00:27:24.900 --> 00:27:26.380]   I went to church with my parents
[00:27:26.380 --> 00:27:28.680]   where we commuted 30 minutes.
[00:27:28.680 --> 00:27:31.500]   All of the kids at church lived in the same city
[00:27:31.500 --> 00:27:35.100]   and were friends already, so I felt I really never fit in.
[00:27:35.100 --> 00:27:37.940]   I went to church all the way through my junior year
[00:27:37.940 --> 00:27:41.500]   of high school, and I never really heard the gospel.
[00:27:41.500 --> 00:27:44.140]   Pastors were preaching, and I can remember hearing
[00:27:44.140 --> 00:27:46.540]   how Jesus died on the cross to forgive sin,
[00:27:46.540 --> 00:27:48.380]   but it never made any sense.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:50.300]   I wondered how could the death of a man
[00:27:50.300 --> 00:27:52.400]   on a wooden post forgive sin?
[00:27:52.400 --> 00:27:55.420]   I grew up in a low socioeconomic area,
[00:27:55.420 --> 00:27:57.180]   and our family didn't have much growing up.
[00:27:57.180 --> 00:27:59.560]   Where I lived, the school boundaries were set
[00:27:59.560 --> 00:28:04.560]   to mix in kids from my area with other areas
[00:28:04.560 --> 00:28:06.400]   which were predominantly white,
[00:28:06.400 --> 00:28:08.440]   and this resulted in getting bullied a lot,
[00:28:08.440 --> 00:28:11.520]   getting into fights, and then what started
[00:28:11.520 --> 00:28:14.480]   a deep-seated desire to fit in and be accepted.
[00:28:14.480 --> 00:28:16.600]   Whether it was at school or at church,
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.200]   I was always looking to fit in.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:22.400]   Once I got to high school, all my friends
[00:28:22.400 --> 00:28:24.280]   kind of ditched me in my freshman year in school,
[00:28:24.280 --> 00:28:25.680]   and I quickly learned to perform
[00:28:25.680 --> 00:28:28.320]   and be like others to be accepted.
[00:28:28.320 --> 00:28:30.560]   I also had the built-in chip on my shoulder
[00:28:30.560 --> 00:28:33.160]   with lots of buried anger due to the bullying,
[00:28:33.160 --> 00:28:36.240]   so this led me to join a gang, get into trouble,
[00:28:36.240 --> 00:28:39.040]   and just live a life in opposition to God.
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:40.920]   I also got into some legal issues
[00:28:40.920 --> 00:28:44.200]   and ended up being prohibited from driving a car,
[00:28:44.200 --> 00:28:47.740]   and as other events unfolded, God opened a door
[00:28:47.740 --> 00:28:50.040]   for me to exit the gang, and he moved me
[00:28:50.040 --> 00:28:51.280]   in another direction.
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:54.520]   I eventually ended up back in school at community college,
[00:28:54.520 --> 00:28:57.840]   and then I transferred out to a college in the Midwest.
[00:28:57.840 --> 00:29:00.880]   I fully engrossed myself with partying, drinking,
[00:29:00.880 --> 00:29:03.120]   girls, drugs, and all the like.
[00:29:03.120 --> 00:29:06.220]   My desire now shifted just to make a lot of money for myself,
[00:29:06.220 --> 00:29:08.600]   and again, I tried to find a place to fit in
[00:29:08.600 --> 00:29:10.120]   in the Midwest where I didn't really feel
[00:29:10.120 --> 00:29:11.740]   like I really belonged.
[00:29:11.740 --> 00:29:16.480]   My peers were preparing, were pulling really great grades,
[00:29:16.480 --> 00:29:17.820]   lining up job opportunities,
[00:29:17.820 --> 00:29:19.960]   and progressing toward graduation.
[00:29:19.960 --> 00:29:22.560]   While everyone else was preparing for new jobs
[00:29:22.560 --> 00:29:24.900]   after graduation, I really had nothing.
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.480]   I believed that I was worthless,
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:28.340]   and I felt so ashamed for having nothing,
[00:29:28.340 --> 00:29:31.320]   and desired in my heart for the riches of this world,
[00:29:31.320 --> 00:29:33.880]   and I also felt that I had to lie and hide all of this
[00:29:33.880 --> 00:29:36.160]   in order to be accepted by my peers.
[00:29:36.160 --> 00:29:38.000]   I graduated, and I came back home,
[00:29:38.000 --> 00:29:39.920]   and was still living out lies.
[00:29:39.920 --> 00:29:41.640]   I finally hit my breaking point
[00:29:41.640 --> 00:29:43.160]   where I wanted to take my life
[00:29:43.160 --> 00:29:46.660]   because it got so mentally and emotionally exhausting,
[00:29:46.660 --> 00:29:48.620]   and my brother, who has always been there
[00:29:48.620 --> 00:29:49.620]   through my entire life,
[00:29:49.620 --> 00:29:52.460]   answering my random spiritual questions I had,
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:53.720]   was living at home at the time.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:29:56.440]   He was in seminary, so he had a lot of resources,
[00:29:56.440 --> 00:29:58.520]   so he gave me Desiring God by John Piper,
[00:29:58.520 --> 00:30:00.600]   and he just suggested me to read the book.
[00:30:00.600 --> 00:30:03.000]   Then one evening in the summer of 2005,
[00:30:03.000 --> 00:30:04.720]   I began reading the book,
[00:30:04.720 --> 00:30:07.580]   and it was this night God had planned my conversion.
[00:30:07.580 --> 00:30:10.240]   I vividly remember that I had to reread chapter two
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:12.040]   because this was the first time I actually heard
[00:30:12.040 --> 00:30:14.640]   and cognitively understood the gospel,
[00:30:14.640 --> 00:30:16.440]   but when I began rereading chapter two,
[00:30:16.440 --> 00:30:18.560]   the verse noted at the beginning of the chapter,
[00:30:18.560 --> 00:30:20.320]   "For the gate is narrow, and the way is hard,
[00:30:20.320 --> 00:30:21.380]   "and that leads to life,
[00:30:21.380 --> 00:30:23.680]   "and those who find it are few."
[00:30:23.680 --> 00:30:25.920]   Though strange was where the Holy Spirit came
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:28.080]   and convicted me of my sin.
[00:30:28.080 --> 00:30:30.040]   I was on that wide path of destruction,
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:32.440]   and in that moment, all the sin that I had committed
[00:30:32.440 --> 00:30:34.880]   in my youth, in the gang, in my time in college,
[00:30:34.880 --> 00:30:35.960]   and all the lying,
[00:30:35.960 --> 00:30:38.120]   all the sin that my mind could conjure up
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.080]   just came rushing back to my mind,
[00:30:40.080 --> 00:30:41.560]   and I saw how all my sin,
[00:30:41.560 --> 00:30:44.600]   including what I was not even aware of or recollecting,
[00:30:44.600 --> 00:30:45.640]   had offended God,
[00:30:45.640 --> 00:30:48.240]   and that I had deserved the full wrath of God.
[00:30:48.240 --> 00:30:51.940]   I felt so sorry for living my entire life
[00:30:51.940 --> 00:30:55.300]   in rebellion and directly opposing God through all of it.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.500]   I felt so sorry to God
[00:30:56.500 --> 00:30:59.420]   that I had wasted the life he had given me.
[00:30:59.420 --> 00:31:01.740]   I confessed my sin, asked God to forgive me,
[00:31:01.740 --> 00:31:03.740]   and believed that Jesus died and rose again
[00:31:03.740 --> 00:31:05.640]   to provide me with this forgiveness.
[00:31:05.640 --> 00:31:09.620]   He accepted me despite how sinful and messed up I was
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:12.460]   and how offensive my life was to him.
[00:31:12.460 --> 00:31:13.900]   I no longer needed to seek
[00:31:13.900 --> 00:31:15.880]   and obtain the acceptance of others.
[00:31:17.240 --> 00:31:19.420]   I no longer needed the riches and place,
[00:31:19.420 --> 00:31:21.900]   value, and the things of this world.
[00:31:21.900 --> 00:31:23.700]   The God of the entire world loved me
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:25.500]   and gave his life up for me.
[00:31:25.500 --> 00:31:27.820]   I believed Christ to be the Lord and King over all,
[00:31:27.820 --> 00:31:28.980]   including my own life,
[00:31:28.980 --> 00:31:30.700]   and I submitted the entirety of my life
[00:31:30.700 --> 00:31:32.580]   to Christ that evening.
[00:31:32.580 --> 00:31:35.980]   Immediately after that evening, God transformed me.
[00:31:35.980 --> 00:31:37.980]   I began to read and meditate on the word daily
[00:31:37.980 --> 00:31:39.980]   and stopped drinking, quit smoking,
[00:31:39.980 --> 00:31:41.540]   stopped partying, stopped lying.
[00:31:41.540 --> 00:31:42.540]   My anger vanished.
[00:31:42.540 --> 00:31:45.100]   I had a deep urge to make all the wrong things
[00:31:45.100 --> 00:31:47.200]   that I had done through my life right.
[00:31:47.200 --> 00:31:50.180]   I didn't stop these things or just modify my behavior
[00:31:50.180 --> 00:31:52.120]   because I owed God something.
[00:31:52.120 --> 00:31:55.720]   Rather, I believed and saw how much God loved me
[00:31:55.720 --> 00:31:57.780]   and how much he had forgiven me.
[00:31:57.780 --> 00:31:59.460]   I wanted to follow Christ wholeheartedly.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.580]   God gave me life and changed me
[00:32:01.580 --> 00:32:04.320]   and all of my desires from the inside out.
[00:32:04.320 --> 00:32:05.860]   One of the things that I hated the most
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:07.260]   was lying to those around me,
[00:32:07.260 --> 00:32:09.220]   and to make these things right,
[00:32:09.220 --> 00:32:11.180]   I went on this tour to meet up
[00:32:11.180 --> 00:32:12.820]   with all of my really close friends,
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:15.700]   and I confessed all of the things I had lied about.
[00:32:15.700 --> 00:32:19.000]   God gave me this opportunity to share how he changed me,
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:21.400]   saved me, and shared the gospel to everyone
[00:32:21.400 --> 00:32:23.760]   in those moments of my confession of sin,
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:25.240]   and since then, four of my friends
[00:32:25.240 --> 00:32:27.720]   came to a saving knowledge of Christ.
[00:32:27.720 --> 00:32:31.080]   You might be thinking, 2005 is so long ago.
[00:32:31.080 --> 00:32:33.200]   Why is he getting baptized now?
[00:32:33.200 --> 00:32:34.780]   I thought the same thing.
[00:32:34.780 --> 00:32:36.120]   I got sprinkled as a baby,
[00:32:36.120 --> 00:32:39.660]   but my desire is to be obedient to Christ, so here I am.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:41.720]   I've come to believe that baptism should express
[00:32:41.720 --> 00:32:44.560]   my conversion and union with Christ.
[00:32:44.560 --> 00:32:46.660]   I also know that God ordained this time
[00:32:46.660 --> 00:32:49.180]   to express how intricately he knows me
[00:32:49.180 --> 00:32:51.780]   and how closely he has been walking with me.
[00:32:51.780 --> 00:32:53.220]   The last four years of my life
[00:32:53.220 --> 00:32:56.300]   have been the most spiritually challenging time,
[00:32:56.300 --> 00:32:58.940]   and God is confirming to me once again
[00:32:58.940 --> 00:33:01.540]   that he knows what I've been deeply considering.
[00:33:01.540 --> 00:33:04.660]   He knows the inside parts of my heart,
[00:33:04.660 --> 00:33:05.900]   and he's been saying to me,
[00:33:05.900 --> 00:33:08.860]   "Remember your first love and return to me,"
[00:33:08.860 --> 00:33:10.860]   so in a way that only God can orchestrate,
[00:33:10.860 --> 00:33:13.100]   I'm going back to the beginning,
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.360]   the union that God has forged through the blood of Christ,
[00:33:15.360 --> 00:33:18.360]   sealed by Christ, is so much more sweet and real to me
[00:33:18.360 --> 00:33:20.760]   as these past four years was confirmation
[00:33:20.760 --> 00:33:23.520]   that nothing will ever separate me from Christ.
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:26.440]   This world is withering, perishing, and it won't last,
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:29.120]   but God has given me what will endure forever.
[00:33:29.120 --> 00:33:30.760]   I hope that my last days here on Earth
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.960]   will be characterized by a sincere and maturing love
[00:33:32.960 --> 00:33:34.360]   for Christ and others,
[00:33:34.360 --> 00:33:37.000]   and a daily faithful obedience to Christ and his word.
[00:33:37.000 --> 00:33:38.620]   To God be the glory forever.
[00:33:38.620 --> 00:33:42.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:33:42.720 --> 00:33:45.560]   (water trickling)
[00:33:45.560 --> 00:33:56.460]   - Please take my hand.
[00:33:56.460 --> 00:33:58.620]   Thank you for that testimony, Brian.
[00:33:58.620 --> 00:34:01.620]   Brian, do you understand that through this baptism,
[00:34:01.620 --> 00:34:03.220]   you express your union with Christ
[00:34:03.220 --> 00:34:04.700]   in his death and resurrection?
[00:34:04.700 --> 00:34:05.940]   - Yes.
[00:34:05.940 --> 00:34:08.740]   - I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:34:08.740 --> 00:34:11.100]   in the name of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:14.000]   (water trickling)
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.160]   (audience applauding)
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:31.880]   - Amen.
[00:34:31.880 --> 00:34:34.000]   Praise God for that testimony
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:36.680]   and the work he has done in Brian's life.
[00:34:36.680 --> 00:34:39.200]   As we continue in the service,
[00:34:39.200 --> 00:34:42.540]   let's all take our Bibles and turn over to Hebrews 12.
[00:34:42.540 --> 00:34:58.380]   And as it is the final service of the year,
[00:34:58.380 --> 00:35:01.100]   I wanna take a moment to encourage us
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:02.540]   as it relates to our faith
[00:35:02.540 --> 00:35:05.540]   and how we can go into the next year
[00:35:05.540 --> 00:35:09.060]   with a great amount of courage, motivation,
[00:35:09.060 --> 00:35:10.300]   and a word from the Lord.
[00:35:10.300 --> 00:35:13.600]   So let me take a moment to read to us from the text.
[00:35:13.600 --> 00:35:15.480]   And it says, therefore,
[00:35:15.480 --> 00:35:19.260]   since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
[00:35:19.260 --> 00:35:21.620]   let us also lay aside every encumbrance
[00:35:21.620 --> 00:35:24.920]   and the sin which so easily entangles us.
[00:35:24.920 --> 00:35:27.320]   And let us run with endurance the race
[00:35:27.320 --> 00:35:30.640]   that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus,
[00:35:30.640 --> 00:35:33.240]   the author and perfecter of our faith,
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:36.320]   who for the joy set before him endured the cross,
[00:35:36.320 --> 00:35:37.880]   despising the shame,
[00:35:37.880 --> 00:35:40.820]   and has sat down at the right hand of the throne of God.
[00:35:40.820 --> 00:35:44.140]   For consider him who has endured such hostility
[00:35:44.140 --> 00:35:46.140]   by sinners against himself,
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.740]   so that you will not grow weary and lose heart.
[00:35:49.740 --> 00:35:51.140]   Let's take a moment to pray.
[00:35:51.140 --> 00:35:54.880]   Heavenly Father, we thank you.
[00:35:54.880 --> 00:35:58.040]   You know us well, and you know, God,
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:36:00.720]   that not only that sometimes we struggle,
[00:36:00.720 --> 00:36:03.200]   but sometimes, Lord, we lose heart.
[00:36:03.200 --> 00:36:05.380]   And what's more, in our fatigue, Lord God,
[00:36:05.380 --> 00:36:10.280]   we have difficulty continuing to run and follow after you.
[00:36:10.280 --> 00:36:13.060]   Thank you, God, from the encouragement from scripture.
[00:36:13.060 --> 00:36:14.620]   And I pray every single one of us
[00:36:14.620 --> 00:36:17.940]   would receive the encouragement you have for us,
[00:36:17.940 --> 00:36:19.460]   receive this word.
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:21.300]   We thank you, it's in Christ's name.
[00:36:21.300 --> 00:36:22.140]   Amen.
[00:36:22.140 --> 00:36:27.220]   This morning, I want us to think about our faith,
[00:36:27.220 --> 00:36:28.500]   because at the end of the year,
[00:36:28.500 --> 00:36:31.220]   we can think about a lot of things.
[00:36:31.220 --> 00:36:34.340]   We can think about things we wish we would have done better.
[00:36:34.340 --> 00:36:36.420]   We can think about how the year went,
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:41.100]   just in terms of the resolutions we made the previous year.
[00:36:41.100 --> 00:36:43.260]   We can think about all the fun events.
[00:36:43.260 --> 00:36:45.460]   We can even think about just how the world does it,
[00:36:45.460 --> 00:36:49.260]   which is they have a countdown of the major news, right?
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:51.420]   Major events in history, fires,
[00:36:51.420 --> 00:36:53.660]   and we had so many things, wars.
[00:36:53.660 --> 00:36:56.480]   And then they just recount the stuff that happened.
[00:36:56.480 --> 00:36:58.300]   But for us Christians,
[00:36:58.300 --> 00:37:03.220]   we want to think about more poignantly our faith,
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.580]   because what we know from God Almighty
[00:37:06.580 --> 00:37:09.180]   is that He wants our faith.
[00:37:09.180 --> 00:37:11.540]   He wants our faith to grow.
[00:37:11.540 --> 00:37:16.120]   He wants our faith to mature, to grow in sincerity,
[00:37:16.120 --> 00:37:19.580]   to grow deeper in the breath of knowledge of God
[00:37:19.580 --> 00:37:21.900]   and His will and more, right?
[00:37:21.900 --> 00:37:26.700]   And therefore, that faith being so important in God's eyes,
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:29.660]   the faith will always be tested.
[00:37:29.660 --> 00:37:34.560]   Your personal faith is at the number one priority
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:36.480]   of Satan's attack.
[00:37:36.480 --> 00:37:38.700]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:37:38.700 --> 00:37:40.540]   Your faith is so important.
[00:37:40.540 --> 00:37:44.940]   Yes, in the past, Satan, in other saints,
[00:37:44.940 --> 00:37:47.860]   even in the Old Testament, for example, Job,
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:52.140]   Satan attacked his body, struck him with ailments.
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:55.900]   Satan attacked his flock, his possessions, his house.
[00:37:55.900 --> 00:38:00.220]   Satan attacked his children, his family, and more.
[00:38:00.220 --> 00:38:02.660]   But what Satan was going after
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:07.060]   was he was pushing Job to say, "God is not good."
[00:38:07.060 --> 00:38:10.700]   Satan was going after his faith.
[00:38:10.700 --> 00:38:13.780]   Likewise, even when our own Father, God Almighty,
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:18.500]   is tending to us, He is going to be pruning our faith.
[00:38:18.500 --> 00:38:22.500]   He is going to be ministering to us by emboldening our faith,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:25.260]   challenging our faith, encouraging our faith
[00:38:25.260 --> 00:38:28.860]   at the agenda of God in this time, in this generation,
[00:38:28.860 --> 00:38:33.340]   for you and me, God is after our faith, amen?
[00:38:33.340 --> 00:38:36.540]   And so, when we come to the end of the year,
[00:38:36.540 --> 00:38:39.340]   we shouldn't be just doing a nostalgic recount
[00:38:39.340 --> 00:38:41.260]   of all the stuff that happened.
[00:38:41.260 --> 00:38:43.340]   We shouldn't be doing best of YouTube.
[00:38:43.340 --> 00:38:47.140]   We shouldn't be doing best of Netflix, top 20 movies.
[00:38:47.140 --> 00:38:49.340]   That's so superficial.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:51.260]   We should be asking the question,
[00:38:51.260 --> 00:38:53.940]   how has God ministered to my faith?
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:58.100]   In what way has my faith grown?
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:01.820]   And how can it grow even more in the next year?
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:05.540]   And with that said, the passage to us tells us,
[00:39:05.540 --> 00:39:08.260]   I'm gonna read again verse one and two,
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:10.500]   that therefore, since we have so great a cloud
[00:39:10.500 --> 00:39:11.900]   of witnesses surrounding us,
[00:39:11.900 --> 00:39:16.580]   let us lay aside every encumbrance and the sin,
[00:39:16.580 --> 00:39:18.620]   which so easily entangles us,
[00:39:18.620 --> 00:39:20.580]   and let us run with endurance the race
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:25.580]   that is set before us, fixing our eyes on Jesus.
[00:39:25.580 --> 00:39:29.660]   What an exhortation and command for us in the upcoming year.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:31.500]   And I wanna reiterate this idea
[00:39:31.500 --> 00:39:34.620]   that the thrust of the sermon, the thrust of this passage,
[00:39:34.620 --> 00:39:38.620]   is a charge for us to run with endurance.
[00:39:38.620 --> 00:39:42.780]   It is a charge for us to keep going at it,
[00:39:42.780 --> 00:39:47.100]   to stay faithful, to stay loyal, to not get distracted,
[00:39:47.100 --> 00:39:49.820]   and all the analogies that come with running a race,
[00:39:49.820 --> 00:39:51.940]   I want you to think about.
[00:39:51.940 --> 00:39:54.460]   Don't get lost and take the wrong turn.
[00:39:54.460 --> 00:39:56.140]   Don't get distracted by the cameras
[00:39:56.140 --> 00:39:57.100]   and the people watching,
[00:39:57.100 --> 00:39:59.980]   and maybe the mockers who are standing by.
[00:39:59.980 --> 00:40:02.980]   Don't be silly and show up in huge sweatsuits
[00:40:02.980 --> 00:40:06.180]   and big down coat jacket because it's cold outside.
[00:40:06.180 --> 00:40:11.180]   Run, run free, run hard, run for the long haul, yes?
[00:40:11.180 --> 00:40:14.580]   But I want to paint a picture for you.
[00:40:14.580 --> 00:40:17.660]   Sometimes when we hear these commandments,
[00:40:17.660 --> 00:40:20.380]   because of our own just weaknesses,
[00:40:20.380 --> 00:40:23.220]   we can accept a less than picture,
[00:40:23.220 --> 00:40:27.660]   which is, well, so long as I'm in the race, I'm okay.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:29.780]   And so one picture is in a marathon,
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.980]   you have those people who just,
[00:40:31.980 --> 00:40:34.940]   all they wanna do is finish.
[00:40:34.940 --> 00:40:37.660]   If they put on the sticker on the chest
[00:40:37.660 --> 00:40:39.700]   and they finish, they're happy,
[00:40:39.700 --> 00:40:42.300]   which in some sense, we understand.
[00:40:42.300 --> 00:40:46.180]   But if your picture of your Christian life is,
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:48.740]   my lungs are burning, my legs are tired,
[00:40:48.740 --> 00:40:51.820]   and so long as I'm finished, I'm good,
[00:40:51.820 --> 00:40:54.340]   versus is that what this passage
[00:40:54.340 --> 00:40:56.660]   wants us to imagine for ourselves?
[00:40:56.660 --> 00:40:59.900]   When Scripture wants us to run,
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.220]   when God wants us to finish the race,
[00:41:02.220 --> 00:41:05.020]   when Apostle Paul in other passages of Scripture says,
[00:41:05.020 --> 00:41:06.980]   I don't just buffet my body for no reason,
[00:41:06.980 --> 00:41:08.180]   I don't beat the air,
[00:41:08.180 --> 00:41:10.740]   but with purpose, with vitality,
[00:41:10.740 --> 00:41:13.820]   I wanna finish and I don't wanna be disqualified.
[00:41:14.780 --> 00:41:16.180]   There's another picture of somebody
[00:41:16.180 --> 00:41:19.260]   who is running with great stride.
[00:41:19.260 --> 00:41:22.620]   Now, my body, for me, when I picture myself running,
[00:41:22.620 --> 00:41:25.140]   I actually picture myself very awkward.
[00:41:25.140 --> 00:41:28.220]   Just recently, I was hanging out with my nephews.
[00:41:28.220 --> 00:41:30.740]   These are just 14, 15-year-old nephews.
[00:41:30.740 --> 00:41:31.660]   And I looked at them and I said,
[00:41:31.660 --> 00:41:34.460]   man, I'm so jealous, your body is so athletic.
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:35.900]   And they were like, huh?
[00:41:35.900 --> 00:41:37.620]   I was like, yeah, your arms are all long
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:40.740]   and your wingspan big for like, good for basketball.
[00:41:40.740 --> 00:41:41.860]   Your legs are all long.
[00:41:41.860 --> 00:41:43.060]   And they're like, what are you talking about?
[00:41:43.060 --> 00:41:45.060]   So we measured. (laughs)
[00:41:45.060 --> 00:41:47.700]   My wingspan's only 5'3".
[00:41:47.700 --> 00:41:50.220]   I have T-Rex arms. (laughs)
[00:41:50.220 --> 00:41:52.660]   And therefore, also my legs are super short.
[00:41:52.660 --> 00:41:54.780]   We sat down and measured our legs
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.820]   and these young guys at 14 years old,
[00:41:56.820 --> 00:41:58.580]   their legs are longer.
[00:41:58.580 --> 00:42:02.100]   I don't picture myself in some kind of majestic stride.
[00:42:02.100 --> 00:42:05.340]   I picture myself doing the do-do-do-do-do-do-do, right?
[00:42:05.340 --> 00:42:07.020]   That's me.
[00:42:07.020 --> 00:42:11.340]   But I want you to picture somebody in full stride.
[00:42:11.340 --> 00:42:13.100]   You know they're a runner.
[00:42:13.100 --> 00:42:15.380]   They don't have whatever sweatpants.
[00:42:15.380 --> 00:42:18.420]   They've got those lightweight running shorts.
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:19.940]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:42:19.940 --> 00:42:23.700]   They've got those, you know, sweat-wicking shirts,
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:25.260]   whatever you may call it.
[00:42:25.260 --> 00:42:29.420]   I want you to picture somebody in full stride,
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:34.420]   running hard, because we shouldn't settle for less, amen?
[00:42:34.420 --> 00:42:36.220]   And so in order to do so,
[00:42:36.220 --> 00:42:38.420]   scripture has for us these exhortations.
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.220]   And the first of it is, God wants us,
[00:42:41.220 --> 00:42:43.780]   God has designed us to be in this community,
[00:42:43.780 --> 00:42:47.660]   but also to think about the host of witnesses before us
[00:42:47.660 --> 00:42:51.420]   that we would find encouragement of faith.
[00:42:51.420 --> 00:42:54.380]   So the first exhortation is, in order to run hard
[00:42:54.380 --> 00:42:56.180]   and in order to run with endurance,
[00:42:56.180 --> 00:42:58.020]   find encouragement from the faith
[00:42:58.020 --> 00:43:01.740]   that is before us and around us, yes?
[00:43:01.740 --> 00:43:07.260]   We are encouraged as fellow witnesses of God.
[00:43:08.740 --> 00:43:13.740]   This passage, chapter 12, comes actually as a big section,
[00:43:13.740 --> 00:43:17.020]   starting from chapter 10, where it talks about,
[00:43:17.020 --> 00:43:19.060]   we need endurance because of the suffering
[00:43:19.060 --> 00:43:20.820]   that we're gonna experience.
[00:43:20.820 --> 00:43:23.460]   And the author says, and God says to us,
[00:43:23.460 --> 00:43:25.700]   we are not like those who shrink back,
[00:43:25.700 --> 00:43:28.420]   but rather we endure even through the hardship.
[00:43:28.420 --> 00:43:31.560]   And then chapter 11, please turn your Bibles over there,
[00:43:31.560 --> 00:43:36.220]   chapter 11 gives to us the examples of the faith
[00:43:36.220 --> 00:43:38.900]   in the patriarchs, the prophets, and the mighty people
[00:43:38.900 --> 00:43:41.460]   who have gone before us, yes?
[00:43:41.460 --> 00:43:44.060]   Question, how do you see them?
[00:43:44.060 --> 00:43:49.060]   When you think about their faith, how do you see them?
[00:43:49.060 --> 00:43:51.940]   Well, as you turn there, I wanna remind to us
[00:43:51.940 --> 00:43:55.580]   that scripture says this, okay, verse one.
[00:43:55.580 --> 00:43:58.820]   Faith is the assurance of things hoped for
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.680]   and the conviction of things not seen.
[00:44:01.680 --> 00:44:05.980]   For by it, the men of old gain their approval,
[00:44:05.980 --> 00:44:08.980]   by faith we understand that the worlds were prepared
[00:44:08.980 --> 00:44:13.280]   by the word of God, so that what is seen was not made
[00:44:13.280 --> 00:44:16.060]   out of the things which are visible.
[00:44:16.060 --> 00:44:20.000]   The people before us that are going to be listed
[00:44:20.000 --> 00:44:23.140]   in chapter 11, they are not called,
[00:44:23.140 --> 00:44:28.140]   and these are the mighty cloud of heroes, superheroes.
[00:44:28.140 --> 00:44:33.580]   These are the mighty cloud of the generals.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:38.580]   These are the mighty cloud of the mighty men of God, why?
[00:44:38.580 --> 00:44:41.660]   Because these individuals were not built different
[00:44:41.660 --> 00:44:46.060]   from you and me, but rather we should be encouraged
[00:44:46.060 --> 00:44:50.820]   that all of them are just like us, amen?
[00:44:50.820 --> 00:44:55.820]   Because the scriptures calls them the cloud of witnesses.
[00:44:55.820 --> 00:44:57.860]   The Greek term for that is martis,
[00:44:57.860 --> 00:44:59.580]   is where we get the word martyr.
[00:45:00.760 --> 00:45:04.760]   Martyrs are not just simply ones who died for the faith,
[00:45:04.760 --> 00:45:06.340]   were willing to go to the far end,
[00:45:06.340 --> 00:45:10.320]   but rather the literal term for martyrs actually means
[00:45:10.320 --> 00:45:14.420]   one who has a witness because they have information to tell.
[00:45:14.420 --> 00:45:18.660]   If we have a trial, we have witnesses.
[00:45:18.660 --> 00:45:22.140]   If we have a witnesses, that individual better have
[00:45:22.140 --> 00:45:22.980]   a story to tell.
[00:45:22.980 --> 00:45:24.940]   He can't show up to the trial and be like,
[00:45:24.940 --> 00:45:26.640]   "I don't know, I wasn't there."
[00:45:26.640 --> 00:45:28.240]   That's not a witness.
[00:45:30.140 --> 00:45:32.580]   These individuals, they were commended
[00:45:32.580 --> 00:45:35.980]   not because they moved mountains
[00:45:35.980 --> 00:45:40.980]   or because they had biceps and muscles made of gold.
[00:45:40.980 --> 00:45:43.180]   They were just convinced of what they saw
[00:45:43.180 --> 00:45:45.660]   and what they saw was the goodness of God.
[00:45:45.660 --> 00:45:50.500]   What they saw was the power of God.
[00:45:50.500 --> 00:45:53.020]   And that is not something that is so far and different
[00:45:53.020 --> 00:45:55.700]   from the convictions we have today.
[00:45:55.700 --> 00:45:57.740]   And so as we walk through this,
[00:45:57.740 --> 00:46:02.740]   the emphasis should be by faith,
[00:46:02.740 --> 00:46:05.880]   Abel offered a sacrifice, verse four.
[00:46:05.880 --> 00:46:11.140]   By faith, Enoch was taken,
[00:46:11.140 --> 00:46:12.900]   which is strange to think about.
[00:46:12.900 --> 00:46:17.220]   Enoch never faced death, but he was martis
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.340]   because he walked with the Lord daily.
[00:46:20.340 --> 00:46:23.580]   By faith, Noah, he was worn by God.
[00:46:23.580 --> 00:46:27.060]   This is verse seven, and he started to build
[00:46:27.060 --> 00:46:30.580]   for year upon year and his faith had to keep at it,
[00:46:30.580 --> 00:46:33.820]   keep going, because every year,
[00:46:33.820 --> 00:46:36.420]   it just looked that much more foolish.
[00:46:36.420 --> 00:46:39.260]   And then verse eight, by faith,
[00:46:39.260 --> 00:46:42.980]   Abraham, who was called out of the Uruk-Haldeans,
[00:46:42.980 --> 00:46:44.320]   he said, "I want you to come out."
[00:46:44.320 --> 00:46:46.380]   "Abraham, where are you going?"
[00:46:46.380 --> 00:46:47.940]   "It's up to God."
[00:46:47.940 --> 00:46:49.860]   He ended up becoming a traveler.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:52.980]   What great risks he took.
[00:46:52.980 --> 00:46:53.820]   Why?
[00:46:53.820 --> 00:46:55.500]   Because he was so sure exactly where he was headed.
[00:46:55.500 --> 00:46:58.280]   He was so sure about the land.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:03.280]   No, no, he was so sure about the one who called him.
[00:47:03.280 --> 00:47:06.260]   That's great faith.
[00:47:06.260 --> 00:47:09.620]   Likewise, down at verse 24, Moses,
[00:47:09.620 --> 00:47:11.820]   he gave up the life of the billionaire,
[00:47:11.820 --> 00:47:15.500]   and I'm gonna read this one, by faith.
[00:47:15.500 --> 00:47:17.580]   Moses, when he had grown up,
[00:47:17.580 --> 00:47:21.180]   he refused to be called the son of the Pharaoh's daughter,
[00:47:21.180 --> 00:47:23.640]   choosing, that's a decision right there,
[00:47:23.640 --> 00:47:27.020]   rather to endure ill treatment with the people of God
[00:47:27.020 --> 00:47:29.660]   than to enjoy the passing pleasures of sin,
[00:47:29.660 --> 00:47:32.820]   considering the reproach of Christ greater riches
[00:47:32.820 --> 00:47:34.320]   than the treasures of Egypt,
[00:47:34.320 --> 00:47:37.600]   for he was looking to the reward.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.780]   Now, pausing there, those are all stories
[00:47:40.780 --> 00:47:42.100]   you are well familiar with,
[00:47:42.100 --> 00:47:45.520]   but the point that I'm making is see and consider
[00:47:45.520 --> 00:47:49.060]   how powerful not is the man, but the faith.
[00:47:49.060 --> 00:47:53.180]   And that faith is something every single one of us
[00:47:53.180 --> 00:47:55.900]   can exercise today.
[00:47:55.900 --> 00:47:59.160]   These men cannot stand up here and say,
[00:47:59.160 --> 00:48:01.780]   you know what, I was just built different.
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:03.380]   I'm a leader.
[00:48:03.380 --> 00:48:05.900]   That is not how the story goes.
[00:48:05.900 --> 00:48:12.540]   This cloud of witnesses is an encouragement to us
[00:48:12.540 --> 00:48:16.360]   because that is exactly what is capable for us.
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:19.900]   That's what we're capable of.
[00:48:19.900 --> 00:48:21.460]   And in order to push that a little bit,
[00:48:21.460 --> 00:48:24.580]   one of the things that I find myself saying,
[00:48:24.580 --> 00:48:26.940]   and I realize other people say it too,
[00:48:26.940 --> 00:48:29.180]   that we should kind of stop because it gives,
[00:48:29.180 --> 00:48:32.260]   rather than this faith confidence,
[00:48:32.260 --> 00:48:35.620]   that the faith that God has given to us is so powerful,
[00:48:35.620 --> 00:48:37.960]   but rather the opposite,
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:41.660]   that we've just become comfortable with failure,
[00:48:41.660 --> 00:48:45.260]   is when we get so encouraged by people's failure
[00:48:45.260 --> 00:48:47.360]   as opposed to their faith.
[00:48:47.360 --> 00:48:48.860]   You know, one of the memories that I have
[00:48:48.860 --> 00:48:53.100]   in our Bible study in Galatians is studying and thinking,
[00:48:53.100 --> 00:48:56.540]   you know, Apostle Peter,
[00:48:56.540 --> 00:48:59.540]   he is like the leader of the Jerusalem church
[00:48:59.540 --> 00:49:01.340]   and he is an apostle of God,
[00:49:01.340 --> 00:49:05.060]   but he too, he too succumbed to the pressures
[00:49:05.060 --> 00:49:06.780]   of man-pleasing.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:09.540]   The Jewish people, the false teachers were like,
[00:49:09.540 --> 00:49:11.760]   we can't fellowship with Gentiles.
[00:49:11.760 --> 00:49:13.180]   We can't eat with them.
[00:49:13.180 --> 00:49:15.100]   And we need to follow the laws of Moses.
[00:49:15.100 --> 00:49:16.720]   And Apostle Peter was like, yeah,
[00:49:16.720 --> 00:49:18.800]   and he started to withdraw.
[00:49:18.800 --> 00:49:20.040]   You know what's so funny?
[00:49:20.040 --> 00:49:22.280]   I remember actually writing on my notes like,
[00:49:22.280 --> 00:49:24.360]   I'm so encouraged that even he failed.
[00:49:24.360 --> 00:49:27.760]   How many of you guys have said that?
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:28.800]   Right?
[00:49:28.800 --> 00:49:32.360]   I'm so encouraged that he's crazy just like me, you know?
[00:49:32.360 --> 00:49:35.200]   I'm so encouraged that these are all just men,
[00:49:35.200 --> 00:49:36.880]   brothers and sisters.
[00:49:36.880 --> 00:49:39.580]   That's not how encouragement works.
[00:49:39.580 --> 00:49:42.680]   You're not supposed to sit there and be like,
[00:49:42.680 --> 00:49:46.340]   I'm so encouraged that that guy can't do it.
[00:49:46.340 --> 00:49:48.740]   You know what that is?
[00:49:48.740 --> 00:49:50.020]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[00:49:50.020 --> 00:49:52.940]   I'm not saying that you shouldn't share your failures
[00:49:52.940 --> 00:49:54.180]   because you're being real
[00:49:54.180 --> 00:49:57.460]   and you're opening up the opportunity for sympathy,
[00:49:57.460 --> 00:49:59.060]   for humility, yes?
[00:49:59.060 --> 00:50:01.060]   Confess your sins, confess your limitations,
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.100]   confess your deficiencies,
[00:50:03.100 --> 00:50:04.780]   but that's not how encouragement works.
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:06.860]   The encouragement works the other way.
[00:50:06.860 --> 00:50:09.100]   What we see in the hall of faith
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:11.880]   are decisions made for God, amen?
[00:50:12.740 --> 00:50:16.420]   I'm gonna walk out because he who promised me is faithful.
[00:50:16.420 --> 00:50:17.980]   Amen.
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.580]   I'm gonna not participate in the luxuries of Egypt
[00:50:21.580 --> 00:50:23.740]   because he said there's something better for me.
[00:50:23.740 --> 00:50:24.580]   Amen.
[00:50:24.580 --> 00:50:28.540]   And there's faith around us.
[00:50:28.540 --> 00:50:31.740]   This year, I am so encouraged by your faith.
[00:50:31.740 --> 00:50:34.540]   Some of you guys have good paying jobs,
[00:50:34.540 --> 00:50:35.860]   but you said, you know what?
[00:50:35.860 --> 00:50:38.940]   This job is killing me and it's totally taking away
[00:50:38.940 --> 00:50:41.700]   from a sustainable relationship with God and my family.
[00:50:41.700 --> 00:50:45.000]   I'm gonna shift everything around, amen.
[00:50:45.000 --> 00:50:48.320]   Some of you guys were in a compromising relationship.
[00:50:48.320 --> 00:50:50.080]   You were failing and you're crossing boundaries
[00:50:50.080 --> 00:50:51.600]   you never should have and you said, you know what?
[00:50:51.600 --> 00:50:56.600]   Forget that, I'm gonna stay pure for God, amen.
[00:50:56.600 --> 00:50:59.420]   That's encouraging, isn't it?
[00:50:59.420 --> 00:51:04.920]   It's not encouraging to sit there and calculate everything.
[00:51:04.920 --> 00:51:07.840]   It's like, oh, but what if I this
[00:51:07.840 --> 00:51:10.300]   and what if this is gonna turn out for our worse
[00:51:10.300 --> 00:51:11.880]   and what if I never find somebody else
[00:51:11.880 --> 00:51:14.160]   and what if this and then how is that gonna provide me?
[00:51:14.160 --> 00:51:16.280]   And then you sit there overthinking everything
[00:51:16.280 --> 00:51:19.400]   and then you squat on a decision for the Lord.
[00:51:19.400 --> 00:51:20.680]   How is that encouraging?
[00:51:20.680 --> 00:51:25.080]   No, no, we find great encouragement
[00:51:25.080 --> 00:51:30.080]   when somebody simply goes from God said I was convicted
[00:51:30.080 --> 00:51:32.640]   and then he led me to the decision.
[00:51:32.640 --> 00:51:35.040]   This was gonna please the Lord.
[00:51:36.160 --> 00:51:39.540]   So I know that the scripture is saying run,
[00:51:39.540 --> 00:51:42.740]   run hard, run long and endure and stuff like that
[00:51:42.740 --> 00:51:45.700]   but that also translates into be convinced
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:47.700]   and just take that step and take that step
[00:51:47.700 --> 00:51:49.180]   and take that step and take that step
[00:51:49.180 --> 00:51:50.220]   and what does that look like?
[00:51:50.220 --> 00:51:51.740]   You're just running with God.
[00:51:51.740 --> 00:51:55.460]   And each decision we make that simply,
[00:51:55.460 --> 00:51:58.860]   that profoundly, that decisively for the Lord
[00:51:58.860 --> 00:52:01.900]   is so encouraging for everybody else.
[00:52:01.900 --> 00:52:04.420]   And I wanna say I'm very encouraged.
[00:52:04.420 --> 00:52:07.000]   I've seen so many of those decisions.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:08.720]   Even with baptism, some people struggling
[00:52:08.720 --> 00:52:11.560]   like I don't wanna speak in front of 400 people.
[00:52:11.560 --> 00:52:12.620]   I get it.
[00:52:12.620 --> 00:52:15.960]   I still get nervous standing in front of you guys.
[00:52:15.960 --> 00:52:18.200]   But they said I'm just gonna be obedient
[00:52:18.200 --> 00:52:20.580]   and I'm gonna do it, amen.
[00:52:20.580 --> 00:52:23.500]   I'm so encouraged by you, I really am.
[00:52:23.500 --> 00:52:26.880]   And I pray that when we think about running forward
[00:52:26.880 --> 00:52:30.920]   that you think more and more how can I simply move
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.160]   from conviction to action because the Lord has said
[00:52:34.160 --> 00:52:36.600]   our faith will move like that.
[00:52:36.600 --> 00:52:39.820]   And that's why we can even say it's also good
[00:52:39.820 --> 00:52:43.160]   for you to look back and see the work that God has done
[00:52:43.160 --> 00:52:47.800]   in your life for your faith, even for you.
[00:52:47.800 --> 00:52:50.680]   As a second point to that, I want you guys
[00:52:50.680 --> 00:52:51.760]   sometimes to think back.
[00:52:51.760 --> 00:52:54.720]   I loved and we were so encouraged by the testimony
[00:52:54.720 --> 00:52:56.480]   given here by Brian.
[00:52:56.480 --> 00:52:59.840]   He said when I was convinced, I said forget that,
[00:52:59.840 --> 00:53:00.980]   I'm not drinking.
[00:53:00.980 --> 00:53:02.480]   Forget that, I'm not lying.
[00:53:02.480 --> 00:53:05.080]   And it just started to move, right?
[00:53:05.080 --> 00:53:06.760]   Well what about your friends?
[00:53:06.760 --> 00:53:10.160]   I didn't think about it, I just did what the Lord desired.
[00:53:10.160 --> 00:53:11.680]   Amen.
[00:53:11.680 --> 00:53:13.160]   It challenges us.
[00:53:13.160 --> 00:53:15.180]   What do you think mature faith is?
[00:53:15.180 --> 00:53:19.720]   It challenges us, what do you think strong faith is?
[00:53:19.720 --> 00:53:21.680]   Is it so complicated that you have to have
[00:53:21.680 --> 00:53:24.120]   the wealth of knowledge from a man who is,
[00:53:24.120 --> 00:53:26.080]   let's say 90 years old and you have to have
[00:53:26.080 --> 00:53:27.300]   the experience of the world?
[00:53:27.300 --> 00:53:29.560]   Sometimes actually the experience of the world
[00:53:29.560 --> 00:53:31.720]   messes you up because you have worldly wisdom
[00:53:31.720 --> 00:53:33.840]   competing with God's word.
[00:53:33.840 --> 00:53:35.840]   Ain't that true?
[00:53:35.840 --> 00:53:42.480]   But strong faith says, no I hear what the Lord has said
[00:53:42.480 --> 00:53:46.680]   and if this pleases my God, he's gonna take care of
[00:53:46.680 --> 00:53:50.000]   any questions I have to ask after this.
[00:53:50.000 --> 00:53:53.320]   And so likewise in Hebrews chapter 10 verse 32,
[00:53:53.320 --> 00:53:56.040]   in this segment on challenging our faith,
[00:53:56.040 --> 00:53:57.880]   this is what the scripture says.
[00:53:57.880 --> 00:54:01.680]   Hebrews 10, 32, but remember that the former days
[00:54:01.680 --> 00:54:04.400]   when after being enlightened you endured
[00:54:04.400 --> 00:54:07.000]   a great conflict of suffering.
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:11.960]   Do you have to be a 15 year old veteran Christian
[00:54:11.960 --> 00:54:14.080]   who's done missions to experience suffering?
[00:54:14.080 --> 00:54:17.600]   No, it can happen the moment you become Christian.
[00:54:17.600 --> 00:54:19.560]   And as a matter of fact, it will.
[00:54:19.560 --> 00:54:22.480]   I remember a young Christian saying the moment
[00:54:22.480 --> 00:54:24.320]   they became Christian, within the first six months
[00:54:24.320 --> 00:54:27.360]   they said this is so hard, I'm so busy.
[00:54:27.360 --> 00:54:29.160]   All of a sudden there's all these things
[00:54:29.160 --> 00:54:31.480]   and I said, yeah, we're running.
[00:54:31.480 --> 00:54:34.720]   We're running towards Christ and it's gonna feel like,
[00:54:34.720 --> 00:54:37.520]   whoa, there's a host of things that God
[00:54:37.520 --> 00:54:39.000]   would want you to do.
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.920]   But take a look, it says, there was a great conflict
[00:54:41.920 --> 00:54:44.840]   of suffering partly by being made a public spectacle
[00:54:44.840 --> 00:54:46.840]   through reproaches and tribulations
[00:54:46.840 --> 00:54:49.240]   and partly by becoming shares with those
[00:54:49.240 --> 00:54:51.280]   who were so treated.
[00:54:51.280 --> 00:54:54.240]   All they had to do was like, mm, I don't wanna be
[00:54:54.240 --> 00:54:56.400]   associated with you guys.
[00:54:56.400 --> 00:54:57.760]   But the moment they were enlightened,
[00:54:57.760 --> 00:55:00.040]   they said, no, I'm part of this.
[00:55:00.040 --> 00:55:01.840]   I'm a part of this march.
[00:55:01.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   I'm a part of this marathon.
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.840]   And they were willing to share in all
[00:55:05.840 --> 00:55:07.640]   of the hardships that came.
[00:55:07.640 --> 00:55:10.520]   And so with that said, the host of witnesses,
[00:55:10.520 --> 00:55:12.480]   the faith that is around you and sometimes
[00:55:12.480 --> 00:55:15.200]   even your own history, you know God
[00:55:15.200 --> 00:55:16.480]   will work in you that way.
[00:55:16.480 --> 00:55:18.960]   And the theme has been when the Lord works,
[00:55:18.960 --> 00:55:21.120]   that allowed them to be free.
[00:55:21.120 --> 00:55:24.880]   Free to sacrifice, free to run, free to leave the world
[00:55:24.880 --> 00:55:29.400]   and free to run in the kingdom of the Lord doing his work.
[00:55:29.400 --> 00:55:31.960]   So with that, we move to point two,
[00:55:31.960 --> 00:55:34.680]   that in order to do that, to run freely,
[00:55:34.680 --> 00:55:37.800]   to run with endurance, we do need to lay aside
[00:55:37.800 --> 00:55:40.480]   every encumbrance and sin that is in this world.
[00:55:40.480 --> 00:55:45.520]   All the things that feels fleshly, earthly,
[00:55:45.520 --> 00:55:49.560]   carnal and just not fruitful,
[00:55:49.560 --> 00:55:52.160]   we need to learn to put it aside.
[00:55:52.160 --> 00:55:54.000]   And that's not something that God is going
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:57.160]   to force your hand to do.
[00:55:57.160 --> 00:56:01.200]   That's something God expects you to wisely think
[00:56:01.200 --> 00:56:03.880]   and cut it off, yes?
[00:56:03.880 --> 00:56:06.520]   He wants you to lay aside whatever it is
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:07.960]   that is an encumbrance to you.
[00:56:07.960 --> 00:56:10.200]   And that's why in this first point,
[00:56:10.200 --> 00:56:13.280]   I say, what is an encumbrance?
[00:56:13.280 --> 00:56:14.880]   Okay, what is an encumbrance?
[00:56:14.880 --> 00:56:17.680]   An encumbrance is something that's just simply a hurdle,
[00:56:17.680 --> 00:56:20.600]   some kind of impediment to you running freely.
[00:56:20.600 --> 00:56:21.760]   Well, put it aside.
[00:56:21.760 --> 00:56:25.240]   As a matter of fact, it's a little hard for me
[00:56:25.240 --> 00:56:27.080]   to stand up here and tell you
[00:56:27.080 --> 00:56:29.840]   what you exactly need to cut out.
[00:56:29.840 --> 00:56:31.080]   I'm gonna give you examples,
[00:56:31.080 --> 00:56:33.840]   but you know that I can't be so specific
[00:56:33.840 --> 00:56:36.080]   as to be like, you know, you and your sports,
[00:56:36.080 --> 00:56:38.680]   your football on Sunday, cut it out.
[00:56:38.680 --> 00:56:40.160]   And I can't be like, you know, your job,
[00:56:40.160 --> 00:56:41.440]   you're putting in extra hours
[00:56:41.440 --> 00:56:44.080]   for that little extra PTO, cut it out.
[00:56:44.080 --> 00:56:45.600]   And you, I don't know what else,
[00:56:45.600 --> 00:56:46.440]   but just cut it out.
[00:56:46.440 --> 00:56:48.280]   I can't do that, right?
[00:56:48.280 --> 00:56:49.120]   Why?
[00:56:49.120 --> 00:56:51.960]   Because you have to feel the weight of what's happening
[00:56:51.960 --> 00:56:53.680]   and you have to lay it aside.
[00:56:53.680 --> 00:56:54.720]   You know, what's very interesting
[00:56:54.720 --> 00:56:56.680]   is this idea of encumbrance,
[00:56:56.680 --> 00:56:59.160]   it's used in many different senses.
[00:56:59.160 --> 00:57:01.640]   In one sense, all it means is a weight.
[00:57:01.640 --> 00:57:06.120]   So it's really, really silly for a marathon runner
[00:57:06.120 --> 00:57:10.120]   to be like, ooh, I wanna be the crazy guy
[00:57:10.120 --> 00:57:12.040]   who wears weights on his legs,
[00:57:12.040 --> 00:57:15.800]   the weight vest so that I work extra hard.
[00:57:15.800 --> 00:57:17.280]   Why?
[00:57:17.280 --> 00:57:18.680]   But it's also crazy to be like,
[00:57:18.680 --> 00:57:20.060]   you know what, I'm a marathon runner,
[00:57:20.060 --> 00:57:22.000]   but I'm gonna take this camp chair with me
[00:57:22.000 --> 00:57:23.740]   just in case I get tired.
[00:57:23.740 --> 00:57:25.680]   And he's running with a camp chair.
[00:57:25.680 --> 00:57:27.800]   That's just silly, right?
[00:57:27.800 --> 00:57:29.440]   So it's just literally weight,
[00:57:29.440 --> 00:57:34.200]   but another use of this term is like a tumor.
[00:57:34.200 --> 00:57:37.080]   I want you to picture with me a gross injury
[00:57:37.080 --> 00:57:38.960]   that turns into an infection
[00:57:38.960 --> 00:57:41.340]   and it develops a sack of pus.
[00:57:41.340 --> 00:57:43.920]   Because the literal way it was used
[00:57:43.920 --> 00:57:46.500]   was something that was swollen after injury.
[00:57:47.460 --> 00:57:49.800]   If you guys have ever had a really gross cyst,
[00:57:49.800 --> 00:57:50.900]   when I was a high school student,
[00:57:50.900 --> 00:57:52.900]   I had one right here behind my ear
[00:57:52.900 --> 00:57:55.860]   and I still have a big scar because I was stubborn
[00:57:55.860 --> 00:57:57.940]   and I know you guys are too.
[00:57:57.940 --> 00:57:59.300]   You guys have this cyst
[00:57:59.300 --> 00:58:00.940]   and you know you should get it checked out
[00:58:00.940 --> 00:58:03.300]   and then you go, nope, I'm not going to the doctor.
[00:58:03.300 --> 00:58:05.640]   Until what?
[00:58:05.640 --> 00:58:07.500]   It bursts, okay?
[00:58:07.500 --> 00:58:09.140]   It's nasty.
[00:58:09.140 --> 00:58:10.660]   You need to go get that checked out
[00:58:10.660 --> 00:58:13.260]   and you know you should get that cut off.
[00:58:13.260 --> 00:58:15.540]   Likewise, don't be stubborn.
[00:58:15.540 --> 00:58:18.700]   Once you start to feel the weight,
[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:21.500]   once you see it starting to grow,
[00:58:21.500 --> 00:58:22.820]   you need to take care of it.
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.100]   You need to tend to it.
[00:58:24.100 --> 00:58:25.540]   What is a fixation for you?
[00:58:25.540 --> 00:58:26.980]   What is a distraction for you?
[00:58:26.980 --> 00:58:29.780]   What is a go-to thing that you regularly go to
[00:58:29.780 --> 00:58:32.700]   where it's become such a pattern that it's a time killer?
[00:58:32.700 --> 00:58:34.100]   It's a focus suck.
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:37.700]   It's all kinds of not so good for the runner.
[00:58:37.700 --> 00:58:40.900]   I took some time to meditate on this for myself
[00:58:40.900 --> 00:58:43.060]   and I found out it was very interesting
[00:58:43.060 --> 00:58:44.100]   in preparing the sermon.
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:46.060]   I sat there and I prayed and I said,
[00:58:46.060 --> 00:58:48.780]   Lord, what is something heavy,
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:50.780]   something weighty that is pulling me down
[00:58:50.780 --> 00:58:52.860]   from running freely with you?
[00:58:52.860 --> 00:58:55.780]   And the Lord was convicting me deeply inside
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:58.620]   that my heart and my mind is filled
[00:58:58.620 --> 00:59:00.260]   with regret and embitterment.
[00:59:00.260 --> 00:59:03.440]   And I thought, that's true.
[00:59:03.440 --> 00:59:05.100]   (laughs)
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:07.980]   It's true and you know why?
[00:59:07.980 --> 00:59:09.960]   It's because I would be driving
[00:59:09.960 --> 00:59:11.600]   and I would just get lost in my thoughts
[00:59:11.600 --> 00:59:13.060]   and my wife would just scream like,
[00:59:13.060 --> 00:59:14.380]   it's a red light, it's a red light.
[00:59:14.380 --> 00:59:15.620]   I'm like, oh shoot.
[00:59:15.620 --> 00:59:18.880]   Because my mind was just elsewhere.
[00:59:18.880 --> 00:59:20.820]   And sometimes I would be driving
[00:59:20.820 --> 00:59:22.380]   and I'd have a scowl on my face
[00:59:22.380 --> 00:59:24.300]   and I would just start mouthing things.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:29.460]   And my wife would look at me like, what are you saying?
[00:59:29.460 --> 00:59:30.600]   And I'm like, huh?
[00:59:30.600 --> 00:59:34.020]   I didn't realize I was mouthing it
[00:59:34.020 --> 00:59:35.780]   and then I feel really embarrassed
[00:59:35.780 --> 00:59:37.340]   and I'm like, I can't tell you.
[00:59:37.340 --> 00:59:40.480]   Because I was actually replaying fights
[00:59:40.480 --> 00:59:42.700]   I had five, 10 years ago.
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:45.060]   I was like, redoing my counseling sessions
[00:59:45.060 --> 00:59:46.220]   of what I would say.
[00:59:46.220 --> 00:59:48.240]   You know how, you guys probably do it too.
[00:59:48.240 --> 00:59:50.240]   If you've ever had some kind of argument,
[00:59:50.240 --> 00:59:51.500]   you're trying to say something
[00:59:51.500 --> 00:59:54.260]   but the witty words come a month later
[00:59:54.260 --> 00:59:55.260]   and you're like, oh.
[00:59:55.260 --> 00:59:57.780]   And then you imagine yourself saying the words
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.620]   and you're like, that's right.
[00:59:59.620 --> 01:00:01.800]   And then in your dream and fantasy,
[01:00:01.800 --> 01:00:03.140]   the person's like, oh.
[01:00:03.140 --> 01:00:07.920]   And then, and it all goes right from there, right?
[01:00:07.920 --> 01:00:09.240]   And the reason why that's a burden
[01:00:09.240 --> 01:00:11.420]   is because I keep living there.
[01:00:12.420 --> 01:00:14.940]   But brothers and sisters,
[01:00:14.940 --> 01:00:18.020]   my mind, my heart, and my emotions belong to God.
[01:00:18.020 --> 01:00:20.120]   Those thoughts do not get to live there
[01:00:20.120 --> 01:00:21.380]   in God's real estate.
[01:00:21.380 --> 01:00:24.460]   If I'm running freely,
[01:00:24.460 --> 01:00:27.100]   then I have to be free to be sober,
[01:00:27.100 --> 01:00:29.980]   to pray, and to think, and to consider,
[01:00:29.980 --> 01:00:31.800]   and to even think about further ministry,
[01:00:31.800 --> 01:00:32.900]   to think about people,
[01:00:32.900 --> 01:00:35.160]   to pray for the things that God's heart is for.
[01:00:35.160 --> 01:00:37.140]   Why am I setting my agenda?
[01:00:37.140 --> 01:00:38.740]   And I realize this, okay?
[01:00:38.740 --> 01:00:40.300]   I could, in one sense,
[01:00:40.300 --> 01:00:41.420]   imagine if this is a car,
[01:00:41.420 --> 01:00:42.900]   be like, God, I want this car.
[01:00:42.900 --> 01:00:43.940]   I have a picture of it.
[01:00:43.940 --> 01:00:45.700]   Give it to me, right?
[01:00:45.700 --> 01:00:47.080]   What else I could be doing is,
[01:00:47.080 --> 01:00:50.020]   God, this scenario, I want you to make it right.
[01:00:50.020 --> 01:00:50.860]   Fix it.
[01:00:50.860 --> 01:00:54.360]   This person, you have to give them their just desserts.
[01:00:54.360 --> 01:00:55.660]   You have to make it right.
[01:00:55.660 --> 01:00:57.020]   Make them understand.
[01:00:57.020 --> 01:00:59.340]   Fix it, fix it, fix it, fix it.
[01:00:59.340 --> 01:01:00.700]   How different is that from saying,
[01:01:00.700 --> 01:01:01.660]   God, I want this car.
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:03.620]   Gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[01:01:03.620 --> 01:01:04.620]   It's the same thing.
[01:01:04.620 --> 01:01:07.340]   What a weight and burden.
[01:01:08.740 --> 01:01:12.580]   And so, I was doing my devotions in 1 Samuel,
[01:01:12.580 --> 01:01:16.120]   and I was genuinely encouraged by the saints of old.
[01:01:16.120 --> 01:01:17.340]   King David was a man
[01:01:17.340 --> 01:01:19.460]   who could have been filled with embitterment.
[01:01:19.460 --> 01:01:20.620]   Why?
[01:01:20.620 --> 01:01:22.780]   The king, the king Saul,
[01:01:22.780 --> 01:01:24.980]   was literally after his head.
[01:01:24.980 --> 01:01:27.280]   What did King David do wrong?
[01:01:27.280 --> 01:01:28.120]   Nothing.
[01:01:28.120 --> 01:01:31.660]   Young David, the only thing he did was he succeeded.
[01:01:31.660 --> 01:01:33.260]   By the mercies and grace of God,
[01:01:33.260 --> 01:01:34.620]   he kept winning and winning,
[01:01:34.620 --> 01:01:37.140]   and then he was killing the thousands and 10,000s,
[01:01:37.140 --> 01:01:39.620]   and then he also happened to be very handsome,
[01:01:39.620 --> 01:01:41.020]   and then he had to be winsome,
[01:01:41.020 --> 01:01:42.060]   and people loved him,
[01:01:42.060 --> 01:01:43.820]   and just for that, King Saul said,
[01:01:43.820 --> 01:01:44.660]   "You're dead,"
[01:01:44.660 --> 01:01:47.420]   and he wanted to spear him and put him on the stake.
[01:01:47.420 --> 01:01:50.900]   But what was amazing was,
[01:01:50.900 --> 01:01:53.140]   David at a young age,
[01:01:53.140 --> 01:01:54.780]   everything was about God.
[01:01:54.780 --> 01:01:58.840]   He said, "The Lord delivered you, Saul.
[01:01:58.840 --> 01:02:00.860]   "The Lord put you in the cave I was hiding.
[01:02:00.860 --> 01:02:02.900]   "The Lord put you in a vulnerable spot,
[01:02:02.900 --> 01:02:04.760]   "but you're also the Lord's anointed.
[01:02:04.760 --> 01:02:07.560]   "The Lord is gonna judge me if I put my hand on you,
[01:02:07.560 --> 01:02:09.940]   "but the Lord will also judge you,
[01:02:09.940 --> 01:02:13.520]   "so between you and me, God will judge."
[01:02:13.520 --> 01:02:15.600]   And I thought, wow, thank you, Lord.
[01:02:15.600 --> 01:02:18.460]   That was the Lord's mercy to me.
[01:02:18.460 --> 01:02:23.320]   Whatever ill feeling I had about the past,
[01:02:23.320 --> 01:02:24.720]   I wanted to say the same thing
[01:02:24.720 --> 01:02:27.240]   to be able to run and be free.
[01:02:27.240 --> 01:02:29.040]   Lord, you'll judge between me and him,
[01:02:29.040 --> 01:02:31.900]   or her, or whoever it is I'm talking to.
[01:02:31.900 --> 01:02:34.460]   Why do I need to redo a fight in my own head?
[01:02:34.460 --> 01:02:37.940]   Why do I need to live in any kind of regret of like,
[01:02:37.940 --> 01:02:39.660]   "Oh, I shoulda said this."
[01:02:39.660 --> 01:02:43.980]   Lord, you will speak what they need to hear.
[01:02:43.980 --> 01:02:45.660]   I trust you with everything,
[01:02:45.660 --> 01:02:48.820]   and I wanna give you that encouragement.
[01:02:48.820 --> 01:02:52.020]   Whatever you experienced this past year,
[01:02:52.020 --> 01:02:54.380]   and if you, like me, carry a burden of weight,
[01:02:54.380 --> 01:02:56.620]   like, "Oh, this has to be made right,"
[01:02:56.620 --> 01:02:58.660]   and, "Damn, you don't understand what they did,"
[01:02:58.660 --> 01:03:01.140]   and anything like that,
[01:03:01.140 --> 01:03:03.780]   trust the Lord, trust the Lord, trust the Lord, amen.
[01:03:03.780 --> 01:03:06.740]   You can unload that weight.
[01:03:06.740 --> 01:03:09.420]   You should.
[01:03:09.420 --> 01:03:11.720]   It's gonna grow like a cyst.
[01:03:11.720 --> 01:03:14.240]   And what's more, Scripture tells us,
[01:03:14.240 --> 01:03:18.660]   there's a passage in Hebrews 12, verse 15 through 16,
[01:03:18.660 --> 01:03:21.780]   "See to it that no one comes short of the grace of God."
[01:03:21.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   Coming short of the grace of God, what do you mean?
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:30.180]   That no root of bitterness springs up and causes trouble.
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.660]   That is a burden and a weight that you carry
[01:03:33.660 --> 01:03:35.700]   that prevents you from running.
[01:03:35.700 --> 01:03:39.580]   And I want us to be able to see and catch those things.
[01:03:39.580 --> 01:03:42.060]   So I ask you this question again as a focal point
[01:03:42.060 --> 01:03:43.340]   of one of the things we have to do
[01:03:43.340 --> 01:03:44.860]   in preparation for the run,
[01:03:44.860 --> 01:03:47.060]   to be ready for the run and sober to run,
[01:03:47.060 --> 01:03:48.900]   to run in prayer, run in evangelism,
[01:03:48.900 --> 01:03:50.620]   run in service, in anything.
[01:03:50.620 --> 01:03:53.660]   What is it to you that is a fixation?
[01:03:53.660 --> 01:03:55.580]   Is it possessions?
[01:03:55.580 --> 01:03:57.020]   Are you a collector of things?
[01:03:57.020 --> 01:03:58.460]   You're just collecting and collecting,
[01:03:58.460 --> 01:04:01.180]   and then for you, it's the next item you wanna collect
[01:04:01.180 --> 01:04:02.660]   and you're just fixated on it?
[01:04:02.660 --> 01:04:06.660]   Know by faith that Christ has said,
[01:04:06.660 --> 01:04:09.020]   the more you collect, there's more to burn.
[01:04:09.020 --> 01:04:12.420]   The more you collect, the more you are exactly
[01:04:12.420 --> 01:04:14.700]   the guy Jesus said in his parable.
[01:04:14.700 --> 01:04:16.700]   There was a man who collected many items
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:19.620]   and decided, "I need a barn for all my stuff."
[01:04:19.620 --> 01:04:21.140]   And then once his barn was full,
[01:04:21.140 --> 01:04:24.500]   he decided, "I need a bigger barn for all my stuff."
[01:04:24.500 --> 01:04:27.460]   But he didn't know that his life would be required of him.
[01:04:28.460 --> 01:04:31.620]   By faith, we recognize these possessions
[01:04:31.620 --> 01:04:34.140]   are literal weights for us in our journey.
[01:04:34.140 --> 01:04:38.780]   What's more, for you, are your regular distractions
[01:04:38.780 --> 01:04:39.620]   the social media?
[01:04:39.620 --> 01:04:42.620]   You thought, you know, I'm just gonna watch a few shorts,
[01:04:42.620 --> 01:04:45.700]   short videos, as they say, and it's so quick, so easy,
[01:04:45.700 --> 01:04:47.700]   and then you realize, oh, it's been an hour.
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:49.940]   You know, like, the time goes so fast
[01:04:49.940 --> 01:04:53.460]   and this is your regular habit of distraction and rest?
[01:04:53.460 --> 01:04:56.900]   Don't you know by faith that the rest that you seek
[01:04:56.900 --> 01:04:59.060]   in the distraction, and sometimes you just wanna
[01:04:59.060 --> 01:05:01.660]   turn off your brain and rest after a hard day's work,
[01:05:01.660 --> 01:05:04.860]   that rest for you comes in Christ?
[01:05:04.860 --> 01:05:08.900]   That any kind of rest you seek?
[01:05:08.900 --> 01:05:11.340]   Sometimes for me, there are statements in my mind
[01:05:11.340 --> 01:05:13.540]   where I literally think, like, you know,
[01:05:13.540 --> 01:05:15.820]   it'd be so nice to grab my camping chair
[01:05:15.820 --> 01:05:18.380]   and just go to the mountains and get lost.
[01:05:18.380 --> 01:05:21.420]   True, sometimes we need those times.
[01:05:21.420 --> 01:05:25.860]   But is it better there or by faith?
[01:05:25.860 --> 01:05:28.700]   Scripture says one day with the Lord
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:30.700]   is better than 1,000 years elsewhere.
[01:05:30.700 --> 01:05:34.500]   You see, one of the things I wanna say to you
[01:05:34.500 --> 01:05:38.100]   is this passage tells to us lay aside the encumbrances
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:39.700]   and the sins.
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:43.340]   Well, the sins that entangle us are our disbelief.
[01:05:43.340 --> 01:05:45.860]   Let me say that again, okay?
[01:05:45.860 --> 01:05:50.300]   The sins that entangle us are our disbelief,
[01:05:50.300 --> 01:05:52.060]   and the disbelief are really subtle,
[01:05:52.060 --> 01:05:54.780]   but they make statements.
[01:05:54.780 --> 01:05:56.700]   What do I mean by statements?
[01:05:56.700 --> 01:06:00.660]   If you live the year, if you have lived the past years
[01:06:00.660 --> 01:06:03.780]   beginning, getting to be more and more pessimistic,
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.020]   there are certain evaluations about life
[01:06:06.020 --> 01:06:08.540]   that you will conclude.
[01:06:08.540 --> 01:06:11.380]   And some of the things I realize in my embitterment,
[01:06:11.380 --> 01:06:14.980]   in my resentment, or in my just regrets,
[01:06:14.980 --> 01:06:17.020]   there are just these thoughts that start to well up,
[01:06:17.020 --> 01:06:18.620]   and there are certain thoughts like this.
[01:06:18.620 --> 01:06:22.100]   For example, I may say, you know what?
[01:06:22.100 --> 01:06:23.940]   People are the same.
[01:06:23.940 --> 01:06:26.060]   People will never change.
[01:06:26.060 --> 01:06:28.620]   If some guy is angry and violent,
[01:06:28.620 --> 01:06:30.980]   he will always be angry and violent.
[01:06:30.980 --> 01:06:32.500]   What's the use?
[01:06:32.500 --> 01:06:36.780]   See, that's worldly wisdom.
[01:06:36.780 --> 01:06:38.940]   God says a man can be born again.
[01:06:38.940 --> 01:06:44.340]   An angry man can be transformed into a saint
[01:06:44.340 --> 01:06:47.700]   who is patient because of Christ, amen?
[01:06:47.700 --> 01:06:52.620]   But by my disbelief,
[01:06:52.620 --> 01:06:54.940]   that's the sin that so easily entangles us.
[01:06:54.940 --> 01:06:57.300]   That's the sin that so easily causes us
[01:06:57.300 --> 01:07:00.580]   to live a life that's entirely different from the race,
[01:07:00.580 --> 01:07:04.060]   from the ongoing, enduring, hopeful pursuit
[01:07:04.060 --> 01:07:05.500]   of His righteousness.
[01:07:05.500 --> 01:07:11.220]   So all of these thoughts that we have in the past year,
[01:07:11.220 --> 01:07:14.420]   when I say, let's evaluate them according to our faith,
[01:07:14.420 --> 01:07:15.820]   I hope we can do so.
[01:07:15.820 --> 01:07:20.020]   And so, I wanna share to us again,
[01:07:20.020 --> 01:07:23.100]   if you here today,
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.220]   I know it's not all of you,
[01:07:25.220 --> 01:07:26.380]   but some of you guys,
[01:07:26.380 --> 01:07:29.700]   the past year has been very, very hard.
[01:07:29.700 --> 01:07:33.820]   And because 2020, 2021, 2022 were really oddball years
[01:07:33.820 --> 01:07:36.380]   with a lot of discouraging things happening in the world,
[01:07:36.380 --> 01:07:40.500]   and yes, if we start to recount and do a video montage,
[01:07:40.500 --> 01:07:42.420]   it's been rumors of wars,
[01:07:42.420 --> 01:07:44.620]   it's been infirmities and sickness,
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:46.700]   and this past year and the last year,
[01:07:46.700 --> 01:07:48.740]   in our church, we actually had a lot of people
[01:07:48.740 --> 01:07:51.100]   lose their parents, right?
[01:07:51.100 --> 01:07:53.060]   A lot of people lose loved ones.
[01:07:53.060 --> 01:07:57.060]   But if your mind starts to be so pessimistic
[01:07:57.060 --> 01:08:01.140]   that you lose sight of the great God who is good,
[01:08:01.140 --> 01:08:03.620]   then you're starting to make
[01:08:03.620 --> 01:08:09.580]   these maybe even subconscious conclusions of disbelief, yes?
[01:08:09.580 --> 01:08:14.300]   But the hall of faith that's been given us, told us,
[01:08:14.300 --> 01:08:17.700]   even Sarah, she was in her old age,
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.260]   but what she did was, yes, she was led to bear a child,
[01:08:21.260 --> 01:08:25.820]   but she trusted the one who is faithful, who he promised.
[01:08:25.820 --> 01:08:29.860]   And that's the encouragement for us to run,
[01:08:29.860 --> 01:08:32.940]   for you to trust the one who is promised, amen?
[01:08:32.940 --> 01:08:35.180]   So finally, as a final exhortation,
[01:08:35.180 --> 01:08:36.860]   then fix your eyes on Jesus
[01:08:36.860 --> 01:08:39.140]   and let us run this race with endurance
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:41.220]   that is set before us.
[01:08:41.220 --> 01:08:43.580]   This passage says, let us run with endurance
[01:08:43.580 --> 01:08:45.860]   this race that is before us, fixing our eyes,
[01:08:45.860 --> 01:08:47.700]   the author and perfecter of our faith,
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:51.780]   who for the joys that before him endured the cross.
[01:08:51.780 --> 01:08:53.220]   And what I wanna share with you is,
[01:08:53.220 --> 01:08:56.300]   just get into this mindset, get into this vision,
[01:08:56.300 --> 01:08:57.700]   that yes, if you're running,
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:09:00.860]   then all the things that feels like you're running,
[01:09:00.860 --> 01:09:03.300]   you should do according to your faith.
[01:09:03.300 --> 01:09:05.900]   I want you to imagine being a runner.
[01:09:05.900 --> 01:09:08.180]   You are the delivery guy.
[01:09:08.180 --> 01:09:11.900]   And a doctor has said, I have this vital organ,
[01:09:11.900 --> 01:09:13.420]   it's the heart.
[01:09:13.420 --> 01:09:15.540]   And that hospital with that patient needs it,
[01:09:15.540 --> 01:09:18.820]   you go run, yes?
[01:09:18.820 --> 01:09:20.900]   Then everything that you're kind of thinking
[01:09:20.900 --> 01:09:22.340]   should start applying.
[01:09:22.340 --> 01:09:24.620]   Before, you were a distracted driver,
[01:09:24.620 --> 01:09:25.700]   you're a distracted runner,
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.620]   but now you're checking the GPS like 15 times over.
[01:09:28.620 --> 01:09:29.780]   Do I have the right address?
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:30.700]   Where is the entrance?
[01:09:30.700 --> 01:09:32.500]   Am I gonna, if when I land there,
[01:09:32.500 --> 01:09:34.980]   how is the, what's the fastest way
[01:09:34.980 --> 01:09:37.740]   to get it to the patient, right?
[01:09:37.740 --> 01:09:39.540]   You're not gonna just get distracted with like,
[01:09:39.540 --> 01:09:43.340]   ooh, but that Netflix show was on at that time.
[01:09:43.340 --> 01:09:45.260]   You're not gonna get distracted with people
[01:09:45.260 --> 01:09:47.300]   yelling at you, screaming at you,
[01:09:47.300 --> 01:09:48.900]   and all that kind of stuff.
[01:09:48.900 --> 01:09:51.460]   You're gonna make sure that even your car,
[01:09:51.460 --> 01:09:53.220]   whatever it is, that it's prepared,
[01:09:53.220 --> 01:09:55.420]   you've got gas, and you're ready.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:09:58.980]   All the analogy makes sense.
[01:09:58.980 --> 01:09:59.820]   Yes?
[01:09:59.820 --> 01:10:02.860]   And so that's what I'm saying here,
[01:10:02.860 --> 01:10:06.100]   is that God told us to run.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:12.380]   God told us to run with endurance.
[01:10:12.380 --> 01:10:14.060]   And if there's any complaint,
[01:10:14.060 --> 01:10:18.220]   if there's any kind of like defensiveness,
[01:10:18.220 --> 01:10:19.740]   we should put all those things aside
[01:10:19.740 --> 01:10:22.060]   because the picture that God has given to us
[01:10:22.060 --> 01:10:24.820]   is we are, yes, in the last days.
[01:10:24.820 --> 01:10:27.700]   We are, yes, think about all the analogies of the Bible.
[01:10:27.700 --> 01:10:29.340]   We are, yes, in the battle.
[01:10:29.340 --> 01:10:30.860]   We're in the spiritual battle.
[01:10:30.860 --> 01:10:34.900]   We're, yes, in the enemy territory here on this earth.
[01:10:34.900 --> 01:10:40.420]   We are servants of God being used for his mighty cause.
[01:10:40.420 --> 01:10:43.180]   All the analogies of scripture has with us
[01:10:43.180 --> 01:10:47.900]   this urgent and very, very serious reality.
[01:10:47.900 --> 01:10:54.140]   I will tell you, though, as I reflected on this passage,
[01:10:54.140 --> 01:10:57.900]   that my heart, in some sense, was filled with defensiveness.
[01:10:57.900 --> 01:10:59.780]   I gotta be honest with you.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:01.260]   For me, if someone told me like,
[01:11:01.260 --> 01:11:04.100]   "Pastor Mark, you need to run with endurance,"
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.820]   do you know what my first response would be?
[01:11:06.820 --> 01:11:08.220]   "Fool, I already am."
[01:11:08.220 --> 01:11:10.860]   I think that's what I would say.
[01:11:11.700 --> 01:11:12.540]   You know?
[01:11:12.540 --> 01:11:16.420]   Now, if somebody who is, you know, my senior,
[01:11:16.420 --> 01:11:17.980]   let's say, Elder Philip, came and said,
[01:11:17.980 --> 01:11:20.580]   "Mark, you need to run a little harder,"
[01:11:20.580 --> 01:11:22.460]   I think my second defense would be like,
[01:11:22.460 --> 01:11:24.180]   "I know, but I'm tired."
[01:11:24.180 --> 01:11:26.700]   Right?
[01:11:26.700 --> 01:11:28.380]   I'm just being honest, I think.
[01:11:28.380 --> 01:11:30.900]   And then I would give something like a,
[01:11:30.900 --> 01:11:32.300]   God, you know, Elder Philip, like,
[01:11:32.300 --> 01:11:34.180]   "You know how busy I am."
[01:11:34.180 --> 01:11:35.820]   Right?
[01:11:35.820 --> 01:11:37.660]   I wanna ask you this question, you know?
[01:11:37.660 --> 01:11:40.380]   This passage to people who are already suffering,
[01:11:40.380 --> 01:11:42.340]   God essentially saying,
[01:11:42.340 --> 01:11:47.340]   "In this run, not only do I not want you to give up,
[01:11:47.340 --> 01:11:49.540]   "but I want you to run with endurance."
[01:11:49.540 --> 01:11:51.580]   That's the challenge.
[01:11:51.580 --> 01:11:52.540]   That's the command.
[01:11:52.540 --> 01:11:58.220]   And we should realize, like, this is God's will for me.
[01:11:58.220 --> 01:12:01.180]   And I accept the fact that I'm going to regularly feel,
[01:12:01.180 --> 01:12:02.780]   then, expended at the end of the day.
[01:12:02.780 --> 01:12:03.620]   Why?
[01:12:03.620 --> 01:12:04.580]   Because I'm His servant.
[01:12:04.580 --> 01:12:06.180]   I'm supposed to be used.
[01:12:06.180 --> 01:12:07.140]   And at the end of the day,
[01:12:07.140 --> 01:12:09.020]   I'm gonna have some bruises and injuries
[01:12:09.020 --> 01:12:11.180]   because I'm His soldier.
[01:12:11.180 --> 01:12:14.380]   And Christ is my commanding officer.
[01:12:14.380 --> 01:12:15.420]   Yes?
[01:12:15.420 --> 01:12:17.060]   And because I'm His runner,
[01:12:17.060 --> 01:12:19.700]   there's a lot of stuff I can't do.
[01:12:19.700 --> 01:12:21.420]   I've accepted that fact.
[01:12:21.420 --> 01:12:25.020]   None of the analogies and metaphors of our Christian life
[01:12:25.020 --> 01:12:28.380]   in the Bible has with it some idea that, like,
[01:12:28.380 --> 01:12:31.540]   "Oh, everything's gonna be manageable.
[01:12:31.540 --> 01:12:33.140]   "We're always gonna have enough energy
[01:12:33.140 --> 01:12:35.820]   "for everything God wants us to do."
[01:12:35.820 --> 01:12:39.420]   But truth be told, God did give us, in His sovereignty,
[01:12:39.420 --> 01:12:41.540]   the exact amount of time
[01:12:41.540 --> 01:12:43.860]   that He wanted for us to do His will.
[01:12:43.860 --> 01:12:48.220]   And should you feel incredibly busy,
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:49.860]   then it's an issue of,
[01:12:49.860 --> 01:12:52.340]   are you running the race God set before you?
[01:12:52.340 --> 01:12:54.580]   Are you running the race
[01:12:54.580 --> 01:12:57.740]   that God has determined for you to do?
[01:12:57.740 --> 01:13:00.260]   Are you busy running around doing, incredibly,
[01:13:00.260 --> 01:13:02.780]   a lot of things that are so, so urgent
[01:13:02.780 --> 01:13:06.140]   and so, so demanding and so, so taxing,
[01:13:06.140 --> 01:13:08.140]   and yet that doesn't have a lot to do
[01:13:08.140 --> 01:13:10.940]   with the race God wants you to run?
[01:13:10.940 --> 01:13:12.540]   That's the question.
[01:13:12.540 --> 01:13:14.420]   And I have been challenged with this.
[01:13:14.420 --> 01:13:16.820]   I'm gonna be honest with you guys.
[01:13:16.820 --> 01:13:19.900]   Being a pastor at Berean is amazing.
[01:13:19.900 --> 01:13:22.020]   It's been such a blessing.
[01:13:22.020 --> 01:13:24.180]   The moment when it is not is when I'm not sober
[01:13:24.180 --> 01:13:26.100]   and I'm just running around
[01:13:26.100 --> 01:13:28.380]   like a chicken with its head cut off.
[01:13:28.380 --> 01:13:31.060]   I'm just doing stuff because I just like doing stuff.
[01:13:32.180 --> 01:13:35.140]   But when I'm engaged in the ministry,
[01:13:35.140 --> 01:13:39.540]   when I go and I evangelize,
[01:13:39.540 --> 01:13:41.660]   I'm praying for the church members,
[01:13:41.660 --> 01:13:43.980]   I'm focused in on the spiritual needs of the flock,
[01:13:43.980 --> 01:13:47.100]   and I'm also focused in my own spiritual need.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:49.140]   Do you have any idea what a blessing that is?
[01:13:49.140 --> 01:13:50.420]   It's incredible.
[01:13:50.420 --> 01:13:54.020]   I feel like this weird sense of like,
[01:13:54.020 --> 01:13:57.380]   wow, what a worthy cause.
[01:13:57.380 --> 01:13:59.340]   What a lasting work.
[01:13:59.340 --> 01:14:01.540]   What a blessedness of God.
[01:14:01.540 --> 01:14:04.100]   And I want you guys to have that exact same sentiment,
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:05.940]   the exact same nature.
[01:14:05.940 --> 01:14:07.420]   For the scripture says,
[01:14:07.420 --> 01:14:10.300]   I'm gonna give you a couple passages here.
[01:14:10.300 --> 01:14:13.580]   In Philippians chapter three, verse 12 through 16,
[01:14:13.580 --> 01:14:15.100]   "Not that I have already attained it
[01:14:15.100 --> 01:14:16.700]   "or have already become perfect,
[01:14:16.700 --> 01:14:20.860]   "but I press on so that I may lay hold of that for which
[01:14:20.860 --> 01:14:24.100]   "also I laid hold of by Christ Jesus.
[01:14:24.100 --> 01:14:26.260]   "Brethren, I do not regard myself
[01:14:26.260 --> 01:14:27.820]   "as having laid hold of it yet,
[01:14:27.820 --> 01:14:30.220]   "but one thing I do, forgetting what lies behind
[01:14:30.220 --> 01:14:33.420]   "and reaching forward to that what lies ahead.
[01:14:33.420 --> 01:14:36.100]   "I press on toward the goal for the prize
[01:14:36.100 --> 01:14:39.020]   "of the upward call of God in Christ Jesus.
[01:14:39.020 --> 01:14:41.620]   "Let us, therefore, as many as are perfect,
[01:14:41.620 --> 01:14:43.260]   "have this attitude,
[01:14:43.260 --> 01:14:45.260]   "that if in anything you have a different attitude,
[01:14:45.260 --> 01:14:47.660]   "God will reveal that also to you.
[01:14:47.660 --> 01:14:51.740]   "However, let us keep living by that same standard
[01:14:51.740 --> 01:14:54.460]   "to which we have attained.
[01:14:54.460 --> 01:14:55.300]   "Amen."
[01:14:56.620 --> 01:14:57.460]   You know,
[01:14:57.460 --> 01:15:00.900]   if you heard me preach the last couple times
[01:15:00.900 --> 01:15:01.780]   and put it all together,
[01:15:01.780 --> 01:15:04.140]   you're gonna hear an interesting theme.
[01:15:04.140 --> 01:15:08.860]   And that theme kinda sounds like a motivational speaker.
[01:15:08.860 --> 01:15:12.260]   A lot of it has to do with a, like a, in summary,
[01:15:12.260 --> 01:15:16.660]   like you can do it kind of tone, okay?
[01:15:16.660 --> 01:15:19.020]   And the reason why I did that was because
[01:15:19.020 --> 01:15:22.740]   I felt this weird sentiment
[01:15:22.740 --> 01:15:25.580]   that a lot of people would say things like,
[01:15:25.580 --> 01:15:27.860]   you know, we can't on our own.
[01:15:27.860 --> 01:15:29.780]   True that.
[01:15:29.780 --> 01:15:31.300]   People were like, you know,
[01:15:31.300 --> 01:15:33.540]   our efforts doesn't really amount to nothing.
[01:15:33.540 --> 01:15:36.300]   Hmm, is that the right way to say it?
[01:15:36.300 --> 01:15:39.620]   You know, we know that we can't and we can't and we can't.
[01:15:39.620 --> 01:15:42.660]   That kinda sentiment was really evident, okay?
[01:15:42.660 --> 01:15:45.860]   And I don't want us to talk that way.
[01:15:45.860 --> 01:15:48.380]   I don't want us to get used to disappointment,
[01:15:48.380 --> 01:15:51.340]   used to failure, be encouraged by sin,
[01:15:51.340 --> 01:15:55.380]   by discouraged, by people not being able to,
[01:15:55.380 --> 01:15:58.100]   and then also concluding, therefore we can't, why?
[01:15:58.100 --> 01:16:00.540]   Because the scripture says, literally,
[01:16:00.540 --> 01:16:03.300]   when you abide in Christ, you can.
[01:16:03.300 --> 01:16:06.700]   We shall not muddy the waters.
[01:16:06.700 --> 01:16:11.700]   Your justification is a work of Christ done, period, yes?
[01:16:11.700 --> 01:16:15.060]   But your walk with God, God said, run.
[01:16:15.060 --> 01:16:17.700]   And God said, run with endurance.
[01:16:17.700 --> 01:16:19.700]   And that's not something where we can say,
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:23.380]   hmm, but if I don't, will you still love me?
[01:16:23.380 --> 01:16:25.300]   Hmm, I don't know if I can.
[01:16:25.300 --> 01:16:26.980]   Did you give me enough?
[01:16:26.980 --> 01:16:28.980]   Hmm, or what about the other people?
[01:16:28.980 --> 01:16:30.460]   Hmm, I've already tried.
[01:16:30.460 --> 01:16:32.780]   Hmm, and then you have all these excuses.
[01:16:32.780 --> 01:16:34.940]   We shall not be like them.
[01:16:34.940 --> 01:16:37.260]   Why?
[01:16:37.260 --> 01:16:39.220]   Because God has given us faith.
[01:16:39.220 --> 01:16:43.180]   And faith is powerful, amen?
[01:16:43.180 --> 01:16:48.540]   Now, know that the scriptures is not telling you
[01:16:48.540 --> 01:16:50.820]   to go run someone else's race.
[01:16:50.820 --> 01:16:53.700]   You don't have to be as strong, as fast as somebody else.
[01:16:54.660 --> 01:16:56.820]   God has said, but I want you
[01:16:56.820 --> 01:17:00.220]   in what God has given you to be faithful.
[01:17:00.220 --> 01:17:03.660]   Apostle Paul says in 2 Timothy chapter four,
[01:17:03.660 --> 01:17:05.580]   verse five through eight,
[01:17:05.580 --> 01:17:09.420]   but you be sober in the things and endure hardship.
[01:17:09.420 --> 01:17:12.780]   Do the work of an evangelist and fulfill your ministry.
[01:17:12.780 --> 01:17:16.180]   For I am already being poured out as a drink offering.
[01:17:16.180 --> 01:17:18.700]   And the time of my departure has come.
[01:17:18.700 --> 01:17:19.980]   I have fought the good fight.
[01:17:19.980 --> 01:17:21.140]   I have finished the course.
[01:17:21.140 --> 01:17:22.500]   I have kept the faith.
[01:17:22.500 --> 01:17:24.140]   In the future, there is laid up for me
[01:17:24.140 --> 01:17:26.100]   the crown of righteousness,
[01:17:26.100 --> 01:17:27.940]   which the Lord, the righteous judge,
[01:17:27.940 --> 01:17:29.980]   will award me on that day.
[01:17:29.980 --> 01:17:32.740]   And not only to me,
[01:17:32.740 --> 01:17:37.340]   but also to all who loved his appearing.
[01:17:37.340 --> 01:17:38.740]   Amen.
[01:17:38.740 --> 01:17:43.740]   So, you may not, you may not be in a position
[01:17:43.740 --> 01:17:46.620]   where you have to do something specific.
[01:17:46.620 --> 01:17:48.780]   God did not call every single one of us
[01:17:48.780 --> 01:17:51.380]   to be a youth group teacher or to work with children.
[01:17:51.380 --> 01:17:52.980]   God did not call every single one of us
[01:17:52.980 --> 01:17:54.420]   to be on stage singing.
[01:17:54.420 --> 01:17:55.940]   God did not call every single one of us
[01:17:55.940 --> 01:17:59.060]   to go lead an event and be an administrator.
[01:17:59.060 --> 01:18:01.060]   But as you guys know,
[01:18:01.060 --> 01:18:06.060]   God called every single one of us to be a witness.
[01:18:06.060 --> 01:18:09.020]   The things that we have you do as a member,
[01:18:09.020 --> 01:18:12.500]   to pray, to devote your life to praying for the leaders,
[01:18:12.500 --> 01:18:14.580]   the members, and every saint.
[01:18:14.580 --> 01:18:18.460]   For you to study your Bible
[01:18:18.460 --> 01:18:21.260]   and just simply apply what you're convicted of.
[01:18:21.260 --> 01:18:23.620]   For you to serve the people next to you.
[01:18:23.620 --> 01:18:25.660]   For you to evangelize.
[01:18:25.660 --> 01:18:28.100]   We're all in that race, amen?
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:30.660]   And I pray that our vision would not be,
[01:18:30.660 --> 01:18:35.020]   well, I hope at least I'm here,
[01:18:35.020 --> 01:18:37.020]   but that we would be willing,
[01:18:37.020 --> 01:18:40.860]   desiring to run hard and with endurance.
[01:18:40.860 --> 01:18:41.700]   Let's pray.
[01:18:41.700 --> 01:18:50.260]   Lord, help me, Father.
[01:18:50.260 --> 01:18:53.860]   I pray, Father God, that you would tend to us
[01:18:53.860 --> 01:18:56.620]   for we recognize our weakness.
[01:18:56.620 --> 01:19:00.060]   Sometimes, God, because of our feeble bodies,
[01:19:00.060 --> 01:19:02.820]   just our fatigue will discourage us.
[01:19:02.820 --> 01:19:05.340]   And sometimes, Lord, our own setback,
[01:19:05.340 --> 01:19:08.140]   our own sin will discourage us.
[01:19:08.140 --> 01:19:10.780]   And sometimes, God, just the disappointments,
[01:19:10.780 --> 01:19:13.460]   maybe even harm inflicted by others,
[01:19:13.460 --> 01:19:15.820]   we can be shaken off our path.
[01:19:15.820 --> 01:19:18.340]   Thank you so much, God, for your word today.
[01:19:18.340 --> 01:19:19.980]   That challenges us.
[01:19:19.980 --> 01:19:23.260]   What encourages us to move past that
[01:19:23.260 --> 01:19:26.780]   is not having everything fixed, everything rectified,
[01:19:26.780 --> 01:19:29.020]   for that day will come.
[01:19:29.020 --> 01:19:30.260]   And we trust you with it.
[01:19:30.260 --> 01:19:34.340]   But Lord, the faith you have given us in you,
[01:19:34.340 --> 01:19:37.380]   the Lord Jesus Christ who runs before us,
[01:19:37.380 --> 01:19:39.740]   all that he has done and endured,
[01:19:39.740 --> 01:19:42.620]   all of that, God, is such an encouragement to us.
[01:19:42.620 --> 01:19:45.900]   So I pray to your glory and to your exaltation,
[01:19:45.900 --> 01:19:48.020]   we will run by faith.
[01:19:48.020 --> 01:19:48.860]   We thank you.
[01:19:48.860 --> 01:19:50.620]   It's in Christ's name we pray, amen.
[01:19:50.620 --> 01:19:54.620]   - Let us stand together for a little closing praise.

[01:24:02.620 --> 01:24:06.220]   God, this is our prayer.
[01:24:06.220 --> 01:24:08.420]   That Lord, by the way we live our lives,
[01:24:08.420 --> 01:24:10.620]   even this week, day to day,
[01:24:10.620 --> 01:24:13.940]   the way that we make decisions about even the mundane,
[01:24:13.940 --> 01:24:17.700]   our work, our schedule, our priorities,
[01:24:17.700 --> 01:24:20.620]   may it be done in faith to your glory.
[01:24:20.620 --> 01:24:23.620]   We ask God that our character as it grows
[01:24:23.620 --> 01:24:25.640]   would bring glory to your name.
[01:24:25.640 --> 01:24:28.220]   We ask God in the way that we speak,
[01:24:28.220 --> 01:24:31.060]   especially in the proclamation of the gospel,
[01:24:31.060 --> 01:24:32.700]   may it exalt you.
[01:24:32.700 --> 01:24:34.060]   And so this is our prayer, Lord,
[01:24:34.060 --> 01:24:36.380]   that in our walking and in our running
[01:24:36.380 --> 01:24:38.220]   and the way that we're living,
[01:24:38.220 --> 01:24:40.820]   that God, it would be done not just simply
[01:24:40.820 --> 01:24:45.820]   as the time goes by, but so purposefully unto you.
[01:24:45.820 --> 01:24:48.520]   And so we pray that you will challenge us,
[01:24:48.520 --> 01:24:51.060]   you will empower us to live for you.
[01:24:51.060 --> 01:24:54.980]   And now, may the love of God the Father,
[01:24:54.980 --> 01:24:56.980]   grace of the Lord Jesus Christ,
[01:24:56.980 --> 01:24:59.020]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
[01:24:59.020 --> 01:25:01.260]   be with you now and forever, amen.
