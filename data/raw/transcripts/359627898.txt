[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   Welcome to Cybersecurity and Internet Safety for Kids.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.000]   Why don't we go ahead and pray and then we'll jump into the seminar today.
[00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   Father, we thank you for just the opportunity to talk about some practical things that parents
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000]   deal with, that we deal with for God's sake in this world.
[00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Lord, as we've been encouraged by anchoring to Christ, I pray Lord God that you continue
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:39.000]   to motivate us to look at things Lord God would spiritualize, that you give us much
[00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:46.000]   wisdom as we try to raise our kids in awareness, but most importantly Lord God that we pray
[00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:52.000]   that we can have just the opportunity to share the gospel with them that they can come to
[00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:54.000]   know you from an early age.
[00:00:54.000 --> 00:01:00.000]   So with all the challenges that we face in this world I pray that we glean some wisdom
[00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   from today's seminar and may you use it for your glory as in all things that we do.
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:06.000]   In Christ's name we pray.
[00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   Amen.
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   Come on in, come on in.
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:10.000]   This is the only way in.
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.000]   Yeah.
[00:01:11.000 --> 00:01:19.000]   Alright, so the genesis of how this class kind of happened, you might be thinking like
[00:01:19.000 --> 00:01:24.000]   how did this come out of a seminar for anchoring to Christ?
[00:01:24.000 --> 00:01:31.000]   So there were some moms in our Sprouts ministry that wanted some kind of information on how
[00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000]   to make the internet usage for their kids safer.
[00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   So that was the genesis, that was talked about months ago and then the opportunity came where
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   a seminar topic was discussed, hey maybe Elder Joe can talk about cyber security.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:51.000]   Now you might wonder like Elder Joseph Jett, how's that have anything to do with cyber?
[00:01:51.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   So if you don't know, this is my background.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   I'm a detective with the Oregon Police Department.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   Another title is a forensic examiner.
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   I basically, I'm on a FBI cyber crime task force for the last five years.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   So this is what I do daily.
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:10.000]   This is my day job.
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:18.000]   Maybe not specifically dealing with some of this, but for the most part, everything technology
[00:02:18.000 --> 00:02:22.000]   related to computers, internet, that's what I do.
[00:02:22.000 --> 00:02:27.000]   This is an interesting quote, technology is only technology to those who were born before.
[00:02:27.000 --> 00:02:35.000]   So case in point, maybe some of you guys are old enough to understand this video.
[00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:40.000]   Okay, so go ahead and lift up the box.
[00:02:40.000 --> 00:02:47.000]   You have four minutes to dial that phone number.
[00:02:47.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   Wait, that phone.
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:50.000]   Kyle, you go.
[00:02:50.000 --> 00:02:52.000]   I'll be running that later.
[00:02:52.000 --> 00:02:58.000]   It's all up in here.
[00:02:58.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   I'm sorry.
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:07.000]   We are arresting you.
[00:03:07.000 --> 00:03:31.000]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:03:31.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   [ Laughter ]
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:20.000]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:04:20.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   So this goes on for four minutes.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:34.000]   If you look confused, you have to lift the phone if you're too young to understand.
[00:04:34.000 --> 00:04:36.000]   I'm not going to call you out.
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:38.000]   I can see it in your face.
[00:04:38.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   All right.
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:42.000]   So the agenda.
[00:04:42.000 --> 00:04:44.000]   So how does this relate to Christianity?
[00:04:44.000 --> 00:04:51.000]   Some current trends, some risks of devices and social media, and then what to do with those things.
[00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   So the Christian perspective.
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.000]   So being naive is not your calling as a believer.
[00:04:56.000 --> 00:05:04.000]   We're not expected to just let the world kind of dictate how we process the Internet and cybersecurity.
[00:05:04.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   So Matthew 10, 16, 17 says, "I'm sending you out like sheep among wolves.
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:14.000]   Therefore, be as shrewd as snakes and as innocent as devils.
[00:05:14.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Be on your guard and you'll be handed over to local councils and be flogged and sent to the guards."
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   So obviously not directly related to cybersecurity for the disciples back then,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:28.000]   but this is the principle that the world is after us.
[00:05:28.000 --> 00:05:30.000]   We're its enemy.
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:32.000]   So know your enemy.
[00:05:32.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   Ephesians 2.2, we did that this morning.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   "In the way you used to live, when you followed the ways of this world and of the ruler of the kingdom of the air,
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:47.000]   the spirit who is now at work and those who are disobedient, remember, we have an enemy."
[00:05:47.000 --> 00:05:52.000]   Spiritual insight and where we're taught connects us to evaluating physical world applications.
[00:05:52.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   So when we think of how we function in the world, we've got to think with a biblical worldview.
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:07.000]   So how does a biblical worldview dictate how we respond and how we protect and how we use the Internet?
[00:06:07.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   So why do we need to talk about cybersecurity?
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   You guys, who doesn't watch the news?
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:22.000]   So everyone recently, the Capital One, the hack, I think it was a billion or 200 million accounts were exposed.
[00:06:22.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   So we're more connected every day.
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:31.000]   This is just an example of just what's going on, not even in the Christian world, everybody.
[00:06:31.000 --> 00:06:34.000]   People are getting hacked.
[00:06:34.000 --> 00:06:38.000]   Attacks are increasing.
[00:06:38.000 --> 00:06:44.000]   So this is a good example of just the background of what the Internet is.
[00:06:44.000 --> 00:06:48.000]   Anyone know what the dark web is? You've heard of it, right?
[00:06:48.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So anyone know what the deep web is? Have you heard that term?
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:56.000]   So just a quick explanation.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:07:00.000]   Surface web, like the example says, is an iceberg, the tip of the iceberg.
[00:07:00.000 --> 00:07:03.000]   Google, what you can see on regular websites.
[00:07:03.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   Deep web is kind of like everything you log into, your Gmail account, everything with a password and user, a username and password.
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   And then if you've watched the news, you know about the dark web.
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   That's where bad stuff happens.
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   Illegal stuff, drug trafficking, all the bad stuff we don't even talk about.
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   So a lot of money is being lost.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   If you think about how much drugs are being purchased on the Internet through the dark web, the scale is pretty big.
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   And me and law enforcement, we're way behind the curve for that.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   And then obviously, they'll sell your information on the dark web.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:44.000]   These are the keys to the kingdom.
[00:07:44.000 --> 00:07:46.000]   This is your identity.
[00:07:46.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   Name, social security, date of birth. That's the three keys.
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   If I have that, I can open lines of credit in your name.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   That's basically the gateway to your identity.
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:02.000]   So obviously, this is something that's very prevalent in the news.
[00:08:02.000 --> 00:08:06.000]   And who's ever had their credit card compromised?
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:08.000]   Yeah?
[00:08:08.000 --> 00:08:10.000]   Pretty much everyone.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:15.000]   So when we talk about phishing, so obviously, this is a church retreat.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   But you guys work in the workforce.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:22.000]   How many of you guys from your companies know about phishing?
[00:08:22.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   So don't click on attachments.
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   Beware of different kind of e-mails.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   So the difficult part is if you see this on a link, what do you notice?
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   That's a Google sign-in.
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   So you're just doing your thing.
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:43.000]   Oh, Google wants me to sign in.
[00:08:43.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   You sign in with your username and password.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   Basically, they've got your information.
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:58.000]   So all of these websites are legitimate, but they can be illegitimized easily.
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   Social engineering.
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:06.000]   So this is something that a warning you might get when someone's accessing your passcode.
[00:09:06.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   If you follow our Facebook page, this is an e-mail from Jason Choi.
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:22.000]   Google is trying its best to try to figure out, okay, this might be a phishing scam.
[00:09:22.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   But you have to understand, any kind of link, there's a possibility it's going to take you,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:32.000]   and there's multiple different problems with that.
[00:09:32.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   It can take you to a legitimate website.
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   It can be the new one I just heard.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   American Airlines sends you an e-mail saying, "Oh, can you confirm this travel ticket you have?"
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:44.000]   "Oh, can I purchase a ticket?"
[00:09:44.000 --> 00:09:50.000]   It goes to the American Airlines website, log in, and then put in your information.
[00:09:50.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   There you go, compromised.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:55.000]   So this stuff is very prevalent.
[00:09:55.000 --> 00:09:58.000]   So these are some broad topics.
[00:09:58.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So the challenge with what I had to kind of whittle down what to talk about.
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   But obviously, we can talk.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   There's a lot of time after this if you want to ask questions.
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   Ransomware is a big one.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:15.000]   Who doesn't know what ransomware is?
[00:10:15.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   Okay, ransomware is basically you click on a link, and it encrypts all your drives.
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   So it's basically--they want ransom because you don't get your data.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   All your pictures, they've encrypted it, and they have the key.
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:31.000]   They won't give you the key unless you pay them.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:36.000]   So all your family photos--this is more on the commercial side in businesses.
[00:10:36.000 --> 00:10:43.000]   All this critical data gets encrypted for functioning of business, and they can't function.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   So a lot of businesses will wind up paying thousands of dollars for that key.
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   That's ransomware.
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   Spear phishing is basically the idea of sending the CEO of a company or an employee an email,
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:00.000]   hoping that person puts on an email.
[00:11:00.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   Doxing is the idea of basically politicians right now, they basically get doxed,
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   meaning hackers will go in and release all of their personal information on the Internet,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:16.000]   where they live, who their family members are, and all that.
[00:11:16.000 --> 00:11:20.000]   So there's a bunch of these things.
[00:11:20.000 --> 00:11:23.000]   Probably some of you got robocalls.
[00:11:23.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   It's huge right now.
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:26.000]   There are too many, yes.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Identity theft, and then obviously your data is already out there.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   If you're a part of the Equifax, that's a billion.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   So all of these things are out there in the open.
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   So who's the target?
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   So when you think about cyber threats, these are typically--you have the activism,
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   that's basically activists who are hackers.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:56.000]   The criminal, the insider attacking inside.
[00:11:56.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   What was I going to say?
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:02.000]   Oh, that's the secret, like spy stuff, terrorism, and then nation states.
[00:12:02.000 --> 00:12:04.000]   So these are the threats.
[00:12:04.000 --> 00:12:10.000]   For us normal people who are living day to day, we don't get most of this.
[00:12:10.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   It might just probably be the crime, the guy who's hoping to send you an email and you click on it.
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:22.000]   So why is cyber security so hard?
[00:12:22.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   The user is going to want to click on that video.
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:28.000]   They want to see that instant thing.
[00:12:28.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   So that's the challenge.
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:34.000]   We are inquisitive in nature of how we do things.
[00:12:34.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   So we won't press, "Oh, what's this big--it has a little Play logo.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:39.000]   I want to see that."
[00:12:39.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And you'll press it.
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:43.000]   That's the problem.
[00:12:43.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   That's the challenge.
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   So how do you--
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   First step, I live in a world of cynicism and skepticism because people lie to me when I work.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:13:03.000]   So whenever you deal with any kind of what we call PII, you have to be skeptical.
[00:13:03.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   People who answer the robo calls and say, "Hey, you need to send money," or the IRS is going to come after you.
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:14.000]   "Okay, how do I send money?"
[00:13:14.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   "Go to 7-Eleven, go buy some gift cards, and scratch it off and tell me over the phone."
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   Does that sound ridiculous to you?
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   Maybe.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   Hopefully you haven't done it, but people fall for it daily.
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:32.000]   They go to 7-Eleven on the phone.
[00:13:32.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Like, "Oh, what?"
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:39.000]   They're talking to the--to basically the criminal, saying, "Which one should I buy?"
[00:13:39.000 --> 00:13:44.000]   And they're taking it from the 7-Eleven or Target or wherever.
[00:13:44.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   So this is real-life stuff.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:51.000]   Typically, people who fall for that really don't know anything about technology.
[00:13:51.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   Senior citizen communities typically do.
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:14:00.000]   So that same password--who uses the same password?
[00:14:00.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   I do.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:02.000]   I do.
[00:14:02.000 --> 00:14:04.000]   I do, too.
[00:14:04.000 --> 00:14:07.000]   Just be honest.
[00:14:07.000 --> 00:14:12.000]   Okay, so laziness is your problem.
[00:14:12.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   Right?
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:16.000]   Yeah, it is.
[00:14:16.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   It is.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   Thank you for that.
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   So basically, one of those passwords is probably floating out there.
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:31.000]   So part of my job right now is to hack into computers of criminals, right?
[00:14:31.000 --> 00:14:34.000]   And hopefully their passwords are floating around.
[00:14:34.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   So right now, I have a--I'm actually working on one right now that's--we're trying to get 900 billion passwords right now.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   So it takes--900 billion, it'll take 15 days to try 900 billion.
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:52.000]   So these passwords are floating out there.
[00:14:52.000 --> 00:14:56.000]   So how do you deal with that?
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   You know what a password manager is?
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:00.000]   Anyone?
[00:15:00.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   Last pass, one shot?
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:07.000]   Basically, it's a program that you--basically, it's a vault, right?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   All you need is one master password that is too strong, and then it builds passwords for you, like long 15-character ones with uppercase, lowercase, symbols, and whatnot.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:20.000]   So it's cheap.
[00:15:20.000 --> 00:15:21.000]   Some of them are free.
[00:15:21.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   But these are good for just your security overall.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:36.000]   If you use the same password for all your banging, then that gets compromised, and the likeliness of it might be higher for you because it's compromising your--in your bangs and whatnot.
[00:15:36.000 --> 00:15:37.000]   Two-factor authentication.
[00:15:37.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   Anyone have this?
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:45.000]   So this is--this is probably even more secure than hard passwords, right?
[00:15:45.000 --> 00:15:53.000]   When you log into Google, you get a text message, like, "Hey, what--I think Chase does it right now," if you have that on, right?
[00:15:53.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   So that--basically, you need a password, and you need a physical device.
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   So authentication is the problem in cybersecurity.
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:05.000]   So they want to be able to authenticate that way.
[00:16:05.000 --> 00:16:07.000]   And then Internet of Things.
[00:16:07.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   So let me tell you what Internet of Things is.
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:27.000]   Basically, everything that's not a computer or your phone or a tablet, basically your washing machine, your refrigerator, your IP cameras, your thermostats, all of those devices are called Internet of Things.
[00:16:27.000 --> 00:16:30.000]   So this is the next generation of what's going to get hacked.
[00:16:30.000 --> 00:16:35.000]   So because the security is not tight on this stuff.
[00:16:35.000 --> 00:16:40.000]   Because there hasn't been a--like, you've heard of those baby monitors getting hacked, right?
[00:16:40.000 --> 00:16:47.000]   And the male's voice starts speaking into this--like, if you watch the news, don't watch the news.
[00:16:47.000 --> 00:16:50.000]   But they can hack those things, so be careful with those.
[00:16:50.000 --> 00:16:53.000]   And put strong passwords on it if you can.
[00:16:53.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   Internet devices, obviously.
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:00.000]   These are the things we typically think of when we're talking about Internet devices.
[00:17:00.000 --> 00:17:05.000]   So, the crucial question, when is the right time for a phone for your kids?
[00:17:05.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   Never.
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:15.000]   What age did you give a mobile device, for those of you who have given, and why?
[00:17:15.000 --> 00:17:19.000]   What justified the giving of that device?
[00:17:19.000 --> 00:17:22.000]   Probably location and connection, right?
[00:17:22.000 --> 00:17:25.000]   Like, back in the day, there was no phones.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:29.000]   Our parents had to just, like, go out and play for the best, right?
[00:17:29.000 --> 00:17:32.000]   Nowadays, it's like, you've got to have your phone on you.
[00:17:32.000 --> 00:17:34.000]   And where are they, right?
[00:17:34.000 --> 00:17:37.000]   Check in now. Like, where are you, right?
[00:17:37.000 --> 00:17:40.000]   So, those are the things, the challenges that we have.
[00:17:40.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   Why? Because our world's different.
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:47.000]   It's--are there more predators out there?
[00:17:47.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   Some would argue, yeah.
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:53.000]   But those are the worst-case scenarios, right?
[00:17:53.000 --> 00:17:58.000]   So, these--and there's hundreds more.
[00:17:58.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   You've got to think of social media like a public restroom.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   You don't just, you know, you don't put out information that's private in a public restroom, okay?
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:11.000]   So, this is a video.
[00:18:11.000 --> 00:18:14.000]   So, it's a viewer discretionary device.
[00:18:14.000 --> 00:18:17.000]   There's, like, people reacting to this, so I've got to kind of qualify it.
[00:18:17.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   They do bleep it out, but, you know, we're at a church retreat, so there's nothing, like, too hard.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:25.000]   It's just--it's just--
[00:18:25.000 --> 00:18:31.000]   Hi, I'm Jack Vale, and I want to see how easy it would be to get personal information from complete strangers.
[00:18:31.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   And while I'm at it, of course, freak them out a little bit.
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:40.000]   Keep in mind, when you watch this video, I got all of this information just by searching their personal social media posts.
[00:18:40.000 --> 00:18:46.000]   And I got it by searching for the closest Twitter, Instagram, and other social media posts to my current location.
[00:18:46.000 --> 00:18:48.000]   Let's go.
[00:18:48.000 --> 00:18:52.000]   So, everybody, are you enjoying Jessica?
[00:18:52.000 --> 00:18:55.000]   I'm Jack.
[00:18:55.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   Hi, nice to meet you. How are you?
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:02.000]   I'm Ashley.
[00:19:02.000 --> 00:19:04.000]   Whenever it comes to me, I know who it is.
[00:19:04.000 --> 00:19:11.000]   I know it's weird, but I have to shout it out to see if I'm right, and in that case, I was right, so.
[00:19:11.000 --> 00:19:13.000]   What the bleep are you doing?
[00:19:13.000 --> 00:19:15.000]   Are you stepping?
[00:19:15.000 --> 00:19:17.000]   How you doing? I'm Jack.
[00:19:17.000 --> 00:19:19.000]   Did you say that?
[00:19:19.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   No, I'm Elena, right?
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:25.000]   Yeah, I know. I was just going to say happy birthday.
[00:19:25.000 --> 00:19:27.000]   Someone in your family is referred to as pop.
[00:19:27.000 --> 00:19:29.000]   Is it a dad or a grandpa?
[00:19:29.000 --> 00:19:31.000]   You're a god right now.
[00:19:31.000 --> 00:19:33.000]   Really? Happy birthday.
[00:19:33.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   Happy birthday to you too, because I know you were actually, I should have said it to you because you're 80 before.
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   I know, I'm just like, hey, it's been like seven weeks now or something.
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:42.000]   But anyway, good to see you.
[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:46.000]   What's with it?
[00:19:46.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   Like a little white curly dog. Sort of like a little white dog.
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:56.000]   Are you a dog?
[00:19:56.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   It goes on for a long time. You guys have a lot of, basically, most of you use Instagram, Facebook, log it down to friends only, right?
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   But your kids, when they get older, when they start social media, if you don't talk to them, they might make you public.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:16.000]   So social engineering. What is social engineering?
[00:20:16.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   Basically, it's basically tricking people into giving your information.
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:24.000]   These robocalls, that's what social engineering is.
[00:20:24.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   They're tricking you to worry about something.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   Hey, we kidnapped your kid.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   If you hang up the phone, your kid's dead.
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:37.000]   Okay, so I can't call my kid, so do I trust this?
[00:20:37.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   These are all the toys that they use.
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   Kids use social media, so they post about personal information, vacation.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   Maybe some of you do that, right?
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:53.000]   It's okay if they're all your friends, but if it's on public, then what?
[00:20:53.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   You escape the location of your backpacker, right?
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:01.000]   You're giving too much personal information out to the internet.
[00:21:01.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   So beware of that when they're using social media.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:12.000]   The challenge is, if your kids are more technical than you, raise your hand.
[00:21:12.000 --> 00:21:14.000]   Okay.
[00:21:14.000 --> 00:21:20.000]   The parents who have older children who are dealing with this, they are more technical than you.
[00:21:20.000 --> 00:21:22.000]   So it's challenging.
[00:21:22.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   So this is just to scare you.
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:26.000]   What's up guys, I'm Kofi Preston.
[00:21:26.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   How easy is it for a pedophile to pick up an underage child using social media?
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   Well, today we're going to find that out.
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:35.000]   I made a fake profile on Facebook posing as a 15-year-old boy.
[00:21:35.000 --> 00:21:40.000]   With the parents' permission, I friend requested three girls ages 14, 13, and 12 years old.
[00:21:40.000 --> 00:21:44.000]   I've been talking to these girls for the last three or four days, and today we're supposed to meet up.
[00:21:44.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   What we found in this video is shocking and something everyone should see.
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:53.000]   Be sure to watch until the end and use what we've learned in this video to better educate your friends and family.
[00:21:53.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   I hope you guys enjoy the video.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   [Video]
