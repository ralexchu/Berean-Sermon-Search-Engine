[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:10.300]   Heavenly Father, we thank you so much for the blessing that we have in you.
[00:00:10.300 --> 00:00:15.940]   Help us to search your word deeply, Lord, that we would not simply know it superficially,
[00:00:15.940 --> 00:00:20.820]   but all of these things, Lord, that serves as a foundation to prepare for Christ, to
[00:00:20.820 --> 00:00:26.740]   know his offering, understanding of our sin, to know your character, that all of these
[00:00:26.740 --> 00:00:33.180]   things that you've purposely placed, Lord, in Israel's history, that we may be able to
[00:00:33.180 --> 00:00:40.020]   have a greater understanding of what Christ has done and what it is that we have in you.
[00:00:40.020 --> 00:00:44.460]   Help us to appreciate the gift of salvation in a greater way, Lord, as we study your word.
[00:00:44.460 --> 00:00:46.940]   We thank you, Jesus, and we pray.
[00:00:46.940 --> 00:00:47.940]   Amen.
[00:00:47.940 --> 00:00:48.940]   All right.
[00:00:48.940 --> 00:00:50.300]   Let's just jump right in.
[00:00:50.300 --> 00:00:53.740]   So today is the peace offering.
[00:00:53.740 --> 00:01:00.060]   Let's see.
[00:01:00.060 --> 00:01:05.060]   Okay.
[00:01:05.060 --> 00:01:31.620]   All right, there you go.
[00:01:31.620 --> 00:01:34.700]   All right.
[00:01:34.700 --> 00:01:40.100]   So the peace offering, the uniqueness of the peace offering, the peace offering is unlike
[00:01:40.100 --> 00:01:45.100]   the burnt offering and grain offering because it was an optional offering, meaning it was
[00:01:45.100 --> 00:01:46.260]   a free will offering.
[00:01:46.260 --> 00:01:50.780]   So God did not mandate this, that you need to bring this at a certain time of the year
[00:01:50.780 --> 00:01:54.540]   or whenever you gave burnt offering, that you ought to give this, but it was a free
[00:01:54.540 --> 00:01:56.780]   will offering.
[00:01:56.780 --> 00:02:02.860]   And it was brought as they willed.
[00:02:02.860 --> 00:02:05.660]   And so it was to fulfill two separate motivations.
[00:02:05.660 --> 00:02:09.820]   One was for gratitude of mercy, so something that was happening in their life that caused
[00:02:09.820 --> 00:02:14.620]   them to be thankful and they brought this peace offering, or it was to fulfill a vow.
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:18.740]   So they made a vow before God and then at the end of their vow, so let's say if they're
[00:02:18.740 --> 00:02:24.340]   going to fast for 40 days or they made a dedication to the Lord for something and at the end of
[00:02:24.340 --> 00:02:30.900]   the vow, they would fulfill the vow by giving this offering.
[00:02:30.900 --> 00:02:35.460]   So this offering was uniquely different than all the other offerings in that the larger
[00:02:35.460 --> 00:02:39.500]   portion of the animal was to be eaten after the fat and entrails of the animals were taken
[00:02:39.500 --> 00:02:41.360]   out and offered.
[00:02:41.360 --> 00:02:46.900]   So if you read the passages carefully, it doesn't spell out, at least in the text that
[00:02:46.900 --> 00:02:50.560]   you looked at in chapter three and parts of chapter seven, it just says that these are
[00:02:50.560 --> 00:02:57.460]   to be offered to the Lord and then certain portions of it was to be cut out and was to
[00:02:57.460 --> 00:03:01.740]   be burned and then the breast and the thigh was to be given to the priest for their portion
[00:03:01.740 --> 00:03:05.900]   to eat and then it doesn't say rest of it you go out to the side and have a picnic,
[00:03:05.900 --> 00:03:10.700]   but it does say in a passage, I don't know if I have that verse here, I don't, okay.
[00:03:10.700 --> 00:03:16.700]   So if you look at Deuteronomy chapter 12 verse 7, and you can just write it down to keep
[00:03:16.700 --> 00:03:21.100]   it there, it just describes all the different offerings and in these offerings, so let me
[00:03:21.100 --> 00:03:44.380]   see if I can do that here, we're on a high tech today.
[00:03:44.380 --> 00:03:46.380]   Yeah this is not connected.
[00:03:46.380 --> 00:03:51.180]   Wow technology stinks.
[00:03:51.180 --> 00:03:57.260]   All right, I'm going to take a chance.
[00:03:57.260 --> 00:04:08.260]   Hold on, I have to reconnect this.
[00:04:08.260 --> 00:04:17.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:04:17.260 --> 00:04:45.260]   [ Silence ]
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.700]   >> Okay, all right.
[00:04:47.700 --> 00:04:53.000]   So, Deuteronomy 12.7, okay?
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:56.100]   So, that's one of the passage where I --
[00:04:56.100 --> 00:04:58.940]   one of the -- the new slide I put up has it,
[00:04:58.940 --> 00:05:00.860]   but for some reason mine doesn't.
[00:05:00.860 --> 00:05:02.600]   But Deuteronomy 12.7 is one of the passage
[00:05:02.600 --> 00:05:05.060]   where it describes the various offerings, and at the end
[00:05:05.060 --> 00:05:07.160]   of it it describes that this is the place
[00:05:07.160 --> 00:05:09.800]   where you ought to go, right?
[00:05:09.800 --> 00:05:11.060]   This is the place where you ought to go
[00:05:11.060 --> 00:05:14.900]   and to have basically a meal together,
[00:05:14.900 --> 00:05:16.660]   to have food together.
[00:05:16.660 --> 00:05:22.060]   But the passage that is more relevant is Leviticus 19.5
[00:05:22.060 --> 00:05:24.300]   through 8, okay?
[00:05:24.300 --> 00:05:25.640]   Can somebody turn your Bibles there
[00:05:25.640 --> 00:05:29.000]   to Leviticus chapter 19.5 through 8?
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:30.100]   Okay.
[00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.600]   [ Silence ]
[00:05:33.600 --> 00:05:34.900]   Let me see.
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:37.660]   I'm going to pick on somebody.
[00:05:37.660 --> 00:05:40.340]   Everest. You have your computer open.
[00:05:40.340 --> 00:05:42.900]   Can you read it out loud for us, 5 through 8?
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:06:10.140]   [ Inaudible ]
[00:06:10.140 --> 00:06:13.240]   Okay. So, if you look at Leviticus 19.5 through 8,
[00:06:13.240 --> 00:06:16.740]   it gives the regulation on what to do with the food,
[00:06:16.740 --> 00:06:19.300]   and that they were supposed to eat it afterwards,
[00:06:19.300 --> 00:06:21.300]   and that you're supposed to eat it that day, right?
[00:06:21.300 --> 00:06:25.060]   And you're not supposed to save anything afterwards, okay?
[00:06:25.060 --> 00:06:27.540]   So, again, the uniqueness of this particular offering was,
[00:06:27.540 --> 00:06:28.800]   it was meant to be eaten.
[00:06:28.800 --> 00:06:31.140]   A portion was given, but the rest
[00:06:31.140 --> 00:06:32.660]   of it was to be eaten together.
[00:06:32.660 --> 00:06:36.000]   And that's why it's called a peace offering,
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:40.100]   but oftentimes it's also called fellowship offering, right?
[00:06:40.100 --> 00:06:45.100]   Because it was meant to introduce to the community an
[00:06:45.100 --> 00:06:48.300]   opportunity to have picnic and eat together.
[00:06:48.300 --> 00:06:51.560]   So, usually when the worshiper came to give this offering,
[00:06:51.560 --> 00:06:53.260]   they didn't come by themselves.
[00:06:53.260 --> 00:06:58.000]   They would come with family, friends, and whoever
[00:06:58.000 --> 00:06:59.400]   that they wanted a fellowship with.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:00.860]   They would bring them together.
[00:07:00.860 --> 00:07:03.040]   So, the worshiper would give the offering, and they would set it
[00:07:03.040 --> 00:07:04.540]   aside with their family and friends,
[00:07:04.540 --> 00:07:07.400]   and then have this picnic afterwards.
[00:07:07.400 --> 00:07:12.600]   Okay. Cattle, sheep, and goats were the animals
[00:07:12.600 --> 00:07:15.840]   that were given to sacrifice.
[00:07:15.840 --> 00:07:17.640]   There was no specific provision made
[00:07:17.640 --> 00:07:19.160]   for the poor for this offering.
[00:07:19.160 --> 00:07:22.560]   Can anybody guess without looking?
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:25.100]   I shouldn't have put it up there.
[00:07:25.100 --> 00:07:26.500]   All right.
[00:07:26.500 --> 00:07:30.060]   Why do you think that there was no provision given to the poor?
[00:07:30.060 --> 00:07:32.800]   Where the other offerings were, he said, if you're poor,
[00:07:32.800 --> 00:07:35.560]   you had an opportunity to give a small bird or a pigeon
[00:07:35.560 --> 00:07:37.860]   or something, but this particular offering,
[00:07:37.860 --> 00:07:40.240]   there is no provision for the poor.
[00:07:40.240 --> 00:07:44.040]   It was already up there,
[00:07:44.040 --> 00:07:47.200]   so if you already read it, you already know it.
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:54.040]   Because the purpose of it was to be eaten.
[00:07:54.040 --> 00:07:57.000]   So, if you brought a tiny little animal,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:07:59.140]   there's nothing to eat, right?
[00:07:59.140 --> 00:08:01.640]   So, there's no point of giving provision, because the whole
[00:08:01.640 --> 00:08:04.440]   point of this is to have a banquet with it, right?
[00:08:04.440 --> 00:08:07.440]   So, if you're a fast reader, you should have read it already.
[00:08:07.440 --> 00:08:11.700]   Okay. But it didn't stop you from bringing the poor,
[00:08:11.700 --> 00:08:14.200]   because the poor could be brought with you
[00:08:14.200 --> 00:08:17.240]   and enjoy the offering that you gave.
[00:08:17.240 --> 00:08:21.240]   All right.
[00:08:21.240 --> 00:08:23.800]   Either the case, even in this offering,
[00:08:23.800 --> 00:08:26.160]   the animal had to be without defects.
[00:08:26.160 --> 00:08:28.100]   So, there was never an instance
[00:08:28.100 --> 00:08:31.260]   where God would receive anything of defect.
[00:08:31.260 --> 00:08:34.820]   Not the offering or the offerer.
[00:08:34.820 --> 00:08:38.580]   So, the offerer had to also go through a ritual cleansing.
[00:08:38.580 --> 00:08:44.520]   Right? So, the ritual itself, it was very similar.
[00:08:44.520 --> 00:08:46.760]   Not similar, it's identical to the burnt offering.
[00:08:46.760 --> 00:08:48.360]   So, I'm not going to go through it.
[00:08:48.360 --> 00:08:49.520]   I'm just going to go through it real quick,
[00:08:49.520 --> 00:08:52.680]   because the other offerings where the animal is sacrificed,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:54.480]   and you'll notice that the beginning portion
[00:08:54.480 --> 00:08:56.620]   of it is identical, right?
[00:08:56.620 --> 00:08:58.380]   So, some of you guys may remember,
[00:08:58.380 --> 00:09:00.460]   the worshiper would bring the animal to the entrance
[00:09:00.460 --> 00:09:03.520]   of the tent of meeting of the tabernacle,
[00:09:03.520 --> 00:09:04.980]   and then it would be,
[00:09:04.980 --> 00:09:07.180]   they would lay their hands on the animal.
[00:09:07.180 --> 00:09:10.180]   And what did the laying of hands on the animal signify?
[00:09:10.180 --> 00:09:14.780]   Union, right?
[00:09:14.780 --> 00:09:18.320]   You're basically saying that you and this animal is one.
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.720]   So, the animal is taking your place in sacrifice.
[00:09:20.720 --> 00:09:24.720]   So, the meaning itself wasn't lost on the worshipers.
[00:09:24.720 --> 00:09:27.660]   They understood that this animal being slaughtered
[00:09:27.660 --> 00:09:29.160]   is being slaughtered on my behalf.
[00:09:29.160 --> 00:09:31.320]   And that's what that signified, when they put their animal.
[00:09:31.320 --> 00:09:33.660]   So, every time they came to sacrifice,
[00:09:33.660 --> 00:09:37.360]   they understood that I needed blood atonement.
[00:09:37.360 --> 00:09:40.980]   I need blood atonement for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:09:40.980 --> 00:09:42.680]   So, this was embedded into their culture.
[00:09:42.680 --> 00:09:46.360]   There's not a single Jew who would not have understood that.
[00:09:46.360 --> 00:09:48.660]   Right? And after the initial inspection of the priest,
[00:09:48.660 --> 00:09:49.860]   he would kill them.
[00:09:49.860 --> 00:09:51.220]   Who's the he?
[00:09:51.220 --> 00:09:53.680]   Does the priest kill or the worshiper?
[00:09:53.680 --> 00:09:56.720]   Remember? The worshiper himself had to do it.
[00:09:56.720 --> 00:09:58.180]   So, this was not like they just brought it,
[00:09:58.180 --> 00:09:59.660]   and then they just kind of watched it.
[00:09:59.660 --> 00:10:01.680]   They participated in the ceremony.
[00:10:01.680 --> 00:10:03.580]   So, the only part that the priest did was,
[00:10:03.580 --> 00:10:06.520]   they would take whatever you cut up and put it on the altar,
[00:10:06.520 --> 00:10:08.160]   and then the rest of the blood, what did they do?
[00:10:08.160 --> 00:10:09.920]   They sprinkled it everywhere.
[00:10:09.920 --> 00:10:11.780]   Right? So, it was a very bloody scene.
[00:10:11.780 --> 00:10:14.360]   So, it wasn't just the priest that got their hands dirty.
[00:10:14.360 --> 00:10:15.620]   It was the worshipers themselves,
[00:10:15.620 --> 00:10:17.420]   because they had to do the slaughtering.
[00:10:17.420 --> 00:10:21.180]   Okay? And God did that on purpose, because, you know,
[00:10:21.180 --> 00:10:23.860]   again, if the whole point of it is to teach the nation
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:26.520]   of Israel the need for blood sacrifice,
[00:10:26.520 --> 00:10:28.400]   that they needed to visually see it.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:31.000]   They were smelling it, and they were touching it.
[00:10:31.000 --> 00:10:34.920]   So, every part of the lesson that God is giving them, again,
[00:10:34.920 --> 00:10:36.220]   it was not just a visual.
[00:10:36.220 --> 00:10:37.760]   It was not just hearing.
[00:10:37.760 --> 00:10:39.160]   It was everything.
[00:10:39.160 --> 00:10:40.760]   Everything was a part of this.
[00:10:40.760 --> 00:10:43.000]   Right? Just like a good teacher would do.
[00:10:43.000 --> 00:10:47.000]   And then the priest would sprinkle the animal's blood all
[00:10:47.000 --> 00:10:51.400]   over the altar, and again, what does the sprinkling signify?
[00:10:51.400 --> 00:10:55.020]   Cleansing. Right?
[00:10:55.020 --> 00:10:56.320]   Cleansing.
[00:10:56.320 --> 00:10:57.620]   So, the blood needed to be sprinkled
[00:10:57.620 --> 00:10:59.120]   with the blood for cleansing.
[00:10:59.120 --> 00:11:01.060]   So, the altar needed to be cleansed,
[00:11:01.060 --> 00:11:02.700]   and so that's what was happening.
[00:11:02.700 --> 00:11:05.500]   And this is identical with the burnt offering.
[00:11:05.500 --> 00:11:08.360]   Right? And then the animal would be skinned, and then cut up,
[00:11:08.360 --> 00:11:10.000]   and then it would be sacrificed.
[00:11:10.000 --> 00:11:14.200]   Right? But the distinction between the burnt offering
[00:11:14.200 --> 00:11:15.760]   and this particular offering --
[00:11:15.760 --> 00:11:17.060]   grain offering we know is different,
[00:11:17.060 --> 00:11:19.420]   because there's no animal being sacrificed.
[00:11:19.420 --> 00:11:21.460]   But this particular offering is different,
[00:11:21.460 --> 00:11:25.500]   because the whole animal is not being offered.
[00:11:25.500 --> 00:11:28.460]   The burnt offering is also called what kind of offering?
[00:11:28.460 --> 00:11:30.720]   Whole offering, because everything was burnt.
[00:11:30.720 --> 00:11:33.620]   But this one, only the portions that they wouldn't eat,
[00:11:33.620 --> 00:11:37.360]   the fat portion, the kidney, and then the breast
[00:11:37.360 --> 00:11:42.000]   and the thigh part, who did it go to?
[00:11:42.000 --> 00:11:43.200]   The priest.
[00:11:43.200 --> 00:11:45.920]   So, they would have their portion, and then the rest
[00:11:45.920 --> 00:11:48.700]   of it, they would eat it as a picnic.
[00:11:48.700 --> 00:11:52.860]   Okay? So, they would give the breast
[00:11:52.860 --> 00:11:56.520]   and the thighs to the priest, okay?
[00:11:56.520 --> 00:11:59.720]   And then the worshipers would get together and eat it.
[00:11:59.720 --> 00:12:04.620]   Again, that passed in Deuteronomy 12.7.
[00:12:04.620 --> 00:12:15.460]   And then Leviticus 7.20, that not only did the animals
[00:12:15.460 --> 00:12:17.860]   that themselves had to be purified,
[00:12:17.860 --> 00:12:19.520]   anyone who participated in this --
[00:12:19.520 --> 00:12:21.920]   so, even though they came and all they did was eat,
[00:12:21.920 --> 00:12:23.960]   they had to go through a ritual cleansing to be able
[00:12:23.960 --> 00:12:27.160]   to participate in this offering, right?
[00:12:27.160 --> 00:12:30.720]   So, even though you may not have been the one offering for you
[00:12:30.720 --> 00:12:34.300]   to participate in the celebration afterwards,
[00:12:34.300 --> 00:12:36.560]   they also had to go through ritual cleansing.
[00:12:36.560 --> 00:12:38.760]   So, everyone had to be purified.
[00:12:38.760 --> 00:12:43.600]   And again, even without me mentioning anything,
[00:12:43.600 --> 00:12:46.120]   you can kind of see the connection, right?
[00:12:46.120 --> 00:12:47.520]   You can kind of see the connection
[00:12:47.520 --> 00:12:49.360]   to the New Testament teaching
[00:12:49.360 --> 00:12:52.700]   of fellowship about the church, right?
[00:12:52.700 --> 00:12:56.200]   No? Well, I'll mention it later on, but you can kind of see,
[00:12:56.200 --> 00:12:59.900]   even without me saying, like, can you see how this is a shadow
[00:12:59.900 --> 00:13:02.760]   of the reality that's coming in the church and membership
[00:13:02.760 --> 00:13:04.300]   in the church and, you know,
[00:13:04.300 --> 00:13:07.320]   that they have fellowship in the Holy Spirit, right?
[00:13:07.320 --> 00:13:10.900]   There is no true fellowship until there is atonement, right?
[00:13:10.900 --> 00:13:12.720]   We become brothers and sisters when we enter
[00:13:12.720 --> 00:13:14.760]   into this cleansing in the blood of Christ.
[00:13:14.760 --> 00:13:17.160]   And so, all of this was a foundation
[00:13:17.160 --> 00:13:20.600]   for a proper understanding of true fellowship
[00:13:20.600 --> 00:13:23.000]   in the new covenant.
[00:13:23.000 --> 00:13:27.000]   Okay? The purpose of the peace offering.
[00:13:27.000 --> 00:13:30.320]   Just as a review, the burnt offering focused
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:32.660]   on the general atonement for Israel's sins.
[00:13:32.660 --> 00:13:35.760]   It was to satisfy God's righteousness and his wrath.
[00:13:35.760 --> 00:13:39.760]   It was the only way a sinful people can have a holy God dwell
[00:13:39.760 --> 00:13:40.200]   in their midst.
[00:13:40.200 --> 00:13:45.160]   So, remember how, if you remember the Book of Exodus ends
[00:13:45.160 --> 00:13:48.300]   with God's spirit up in the mountain, and then he comes
[00:13:48.300 --> 00:13:51.100]   and he makes his dwelling at the tent.
[00:13:51.100 --> 00:13:55.360]   But before he can invite the Israelites into the tent,
[00:13:55.360 --> 00:13:58.900]   they have to go through this atonement, right?
[00:13:58.900 --> 00:14:03.160]   So, the only way that a sinful people can have a holy God dwell
[00:14:03.160 --> 00:14:06.520]   among them was a constant atonement of their sins.
[00:14:06.520 --> 00:14:08.000]   And that was the burnt offering.
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:08.800]   And the burnt offering,
[00:14:08.800 --> 00:14:11.800]   how often did the burnt offering happen?
[00:14:11.800 --> 00:14:13.800]   Every single day, morning and night.
[00:14:13.800 --> 00:14:16.660]   So, the altar was being burnt all the time, constantly.
[00:14:16.660 --> 00:14:18.960]   And then each time they did a burnt offering,
[00:14:18.960 --> 00:14:22.200]   what offering was given with it, typically?
[00:14:22.200 --> 00:14:24.860]   The grain offering, right, as a dedication.
[00:14:24.860 --> 00:14:28.300]   So, once your sins are atoned for, right, the second part
[00:14:28.300 --> 00:14:30.300]   of that is an act of dedication,
[00:14:30.300 --> 00:14:32.420]   which was the second part, right?
[00:14:32.420 --> 00:14:36.120]   The grain offering focused on Israel's dependence upon God,
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:37.820]   not only for forgiveness and spiritual life,
[00:14:37.820 --> 00:14:39.920]   but for the physical life.
[00:14:39.920 --> 00:14:41.460]   It was an expression of tribute.
[00:14:41.460 --> 00:14:42.900]   Remember that last week?
[00:14:42.900 --> 00:14:44.960]   That ultimately belonged to God to express lordship.
[00:14:44.960 --> 00:14:50.900]   So, we talked about how if burnt offering is justification,
[00:14:50.900 --> 00:14:54.660]   the grain offering, in a sense, is sanctification,
[00:14:54.660 --> 00:15:00.720]   where you're offering your life as a living sacrifice, right?
[00:15:00.720 --> 00:15:03.200]   So, again, this was done, like,
[00:15:03.200 --> 00:15:06.120]   morning and night every single day.
[00:15:06.120 --> 00:15:09.060]   The burnt offering and grain offering was offered almost
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:09.900]   every single day.
[00:15:09.900 --> 00:15:10.600]   Not almost everything.
[00:15:10.600 --> 00:15:12.000]   It was offered morning and night.
[00:15:12.000 --> 00:15:14.400]   So, it was constantly burning, constantly giving.
[00:15:14.400 --> 00:15:16.820]   And so, this was to signify to the nation of Israel
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.920]   that this is how -- this is the only way a sinful people can
[00:15:20.920 --> 00:15:23.020]   have a relationship with the holy God,
[00:15:23.020 --> 00:15:26.960]   through the blood atonement and through the sacrifice, okay?
[00:15:26.960 --> 00:15:31.960]   But the peace offering focuses on Israel's peace with God,
[00:15:31.960 --> 00:15:35.560]   right, the result of these offerings that resulted
[00:15:35.560 --> 00:15:38.360]   in peace with God, right?
[00:15:38.360 --> 00:15:40.860]   The joys and peace of mind, which comes from knowing
[00:15:40.860 --> 00:15:43.560]   that God is at peace with his people.
[00:15:43.560 --> 00:15:45.300]   So, the purpose of this is --
[00:15:45.300 --> 00:15:46.760]   was for the purpose of celebration.
[00:15:46.760 --> 00:15:48.900]   So, you give the burnt offering,
[00:15:48.900 --> 00:15:53.020]   and then you give the grain offering as a tribute,
[00:15:53.020 --> 00:15:56.220]   as an act of dedication and thanksgiving to God.
[00:15:56.220 --> 00:15:58.320]   And then the peace offering basically was a celebration,
[00:15:58.320 --> 00:16:01.460]   a freewill offering that you brought to God to thank him
[00:16:01.460 --> 00:16:04.400]   for the relationship that they were to have with him
[00:16:04.400 --> 00:16:07.900]   because of the sacrifice, right?
[00:16:07.900 --> 00:16:14.540]   The Hebrew word for peace offering, or peace,
[00:16:14.540 --> 00:16:15.900]   is shalamim, okay?
[00:16:15.900 --> 00:16:18.760]   That's the word that is used here.
[00:16:18.760 --> 00:16:22.740]   And this is -- this is the part that really kind of shines light
[00:16:22.740 --> 00:16:25.340]   on the significance of this offering.
[00:16:25.340 --> 00:16:33.340]   The word literally means to be complete or whole,
[00:16:33.340 --> 00:16:36.200]   to be complete or whole.
[00:16:36.200 --> 00:16:40.360]   So, a Jew who would have understood the peace offering
[00:16:40.360 --> 00:16:44.440]   would have understood that this was the complete offering,
[00:16:44.440 --> 00:16:49.340]   that this offering signified that they were made well, right?
[00:16:49.340 --> 00:16:54.000]   I think the -- maybe the best way for us to understand it is
[00:16:54.000 --> 00:16:56.760]   if somebody was sick and that they were made well,
[00:16:56.760 --> 00:16:59.960]   that that would be like, oh, they've been made complete.
[00:16:59.960 --> 00:17:06.000]   Right? The idea of peace in Hebrew is more than absence
[00:17:06.000 --> 00:17:08.540]   of war, right?
[00:17:08.540 --> 00:17:11.600]   To be complete, a Jew would not have understood.
[00:17:11.600 --> 00:17:12.860]   It's like, oh, okay, there's no war.
[00:17:12.860 --> 00:17:15.660]   There's no turmoil.
[00:17:15.660 --> 00:17:18.500]   The Hebrew word for shalom signified completeness
[00:17:18.500 --> 00:17:19.900]   or wholeness in God.
[00:17:19.900 --> 00:17:22.360]   So, you know that that was the most common greeting
[00:17:22.360 --> 00:17:24.000]   that they had among the Jews.
[00:17:24.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   They would say, shalom, shalom.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.660]   And so, shalom literally means peace, but the idea of peace
[00:17:29.660 --> 00:17:34.500]   to a Jew was more than -- more than just not being in war.
[00:17:34.500 --> 00:17:35.960]   Right? So, when they greeted
[00:17:35.960 --> 00:17:37.460]   each other with shalom,
[00:17:37.460 --> 00:17:39.940]   it meant that the Lord's blessing be upon you.
[00:17:39.940 --> 00:17:42.760]   May God's favor be upon you.
[00:17:42.760 --> 00:17:46.400]   Right? May God be on your side.
[00:17:46.400 --> 00:17:49.860]   And so, this offering was a constant reminder to the nation
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:53.060]   of Israel that the only way that they could be whole
[00:17:53.060 --> 00:17:54.940]   with God is through the blood sacrifice.
[00:17:54.940 --> 00:17:57.840]   And so, it was an act of thanksgiving to God.
[00:17:57.840 --> 00:18:01.060]   And so, this was not a solemn occasion.
[00:18:01.060 --> 00:18:05.660]   Right? The burnt offering was for the forgiveness of sins.
[00:18:05.660 --> 00:18:07.860]   Right? The grain offering at times is celebration.
[00:18:07.860 --> 00:18:10.240]   At times, it's at the end of a vow.
[00:18:10.240 --> 00:18:14.160]   But this offering was almost -- it's equated with joy
[00:18:14.160 --> 00:18:17.900]   because it's meant to be taken aside,
[00:18:17.900 --> 00:18:19.800]   and it is not a solemn celebration,
[00:18:19.800 --> 00:18:21.260]   but a joyous celebration.
[00:18:21.260 --> 00:18:22.960]   Right? It's like a picnic.
[00:18:22.960 --> 00:18:24.400]   Kind of like when the churches get together
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.240]   and they have a picnic, you don't have a solemn picnic.
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.000]   Right? The idea of picnic is to go out
[00:18:29.000 --> 00:18:30.760]   and have fun and to celebrate.
[00:18:30.760 --> 00:18:34.060]   And so, that was the idea behind this particular offering,
[00:18:34.060 --> 00:18:35.200]   to be made whole.
[00:18:35.200 --> 00:18:39.940]   And I think a best illustration of this idea of wholeness
[00:18:39.940 --> 00:18:42.660]   is in the relationship with Adam and Eve.
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:46.800]   Remember when God creates Adam, he looks at Adam and he says,
[00:18:46.800 --> 00:18:49.400]   "What? It is not good for him to be alone."
[00:18:49.400 --> 00:18:53.740]   So, the concept of it is that he wasn't complete yet.
[00:18:53.740 --> 00:18:56.500]   Right? I know it's Valentine's Day.
[00:18:56.500 --> 00:18:58.560]   Don't equate this with Valentine's, okay?
[00:18:58.560 --> 00:19:02.100]   Because I'm going to knock it down afterwards,
[00:19:02.100 --> 00:19:03.840]   so don't get your hopes up.
[00:19:03.840 --> 00:19:08.660]   Right? But the idea is that Adam wasn't complete yet.
[00:19:08.660 --> 00:19:14.600]   Right? So, he makes a suitable helper to complement him,
[00:19:14.600 --> 00:19:18.040]   to help him along with his work, to be a companion.
[00:19:18.040 --> 00:19:22.700]   Right? So, Adam was not made whole until he sees Eve
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:25.140]   and says, "Bone of my bone, flesh of my flesh,"
[00:19:25.140 --> 00:19:26.440]   and then he is complete.
[00:19:26.440 --> 00:19:28.360]   So, the idea when God looks at Adam and said,
[00:19:28.360 --> 00:19:30.100]   "It is not good for him to be alone."
[00:19:30.100 --> 00:19:33.340]   God didn't create Adam to be not good.
[00:19:33.340 --> 00:19:34.540]   Right? That's not what he means.
[00:19:34.540 --> 00:19:38.140]   When we say the way we use the word good or bad is morally good
[00:19:38.140 --> 00:19:42.800]   or morally bad or something that is tainted.
[00:19:42.800 --> 00:19:45.600]   That's what we think is something good and something bad.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:49.400]   The idea of the word when God said it is not good,
[00:19:49.400 --> 00:19:51.860]   the idea is he is not complete.
[00:19:51.860 --> 00:19:55.760]   Right? Because he needs a counterpart that he can commune
[00:19:55.760 --> 00:19:57.700]   with, fellowship and work with.
[00:19:57.700 --> 00:20:01.260]   So, that's the idea of completeness or peace.
[00:20:01.260 --> 00:20:05.260]   And it is that peace or that completeness that God gave Adam
[00:20:05.260 --> 00:20:08.860]   through Eve that was broken at the fall.
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:14.200]   Right? So, this union that God gave Adam and Eve, right,
[00:20:14.200 --> 00:20:18.000]   because Adam was not complete, because he was alone,
[00:20:18.000 --> 00:20:20.600]   he couldn't bear fruit.
[00:20:20.600 --> 00:20:22.200]   God told him to be fruitful and multiply,
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:24.600]   but he couldn't do that until Eve shows up.
[00:20:24.600 --> 00:20:27.120]   So, the counterpart shows up and he's made complete.
[00:20:27.120 --> 00:20:31.820]   And so, again, the picture of the fall is the brokenness
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:34.360]   of that peace between husband and wife.
[00:20:34.360 --> 00:20:37.320]   Right? So, because peace with God is broken,
[00:20:37.320 --> 00:20:39.360]   peace with husband and wife is broken.
[00:20:39.360 --> 00:20:42.800]   And as a result of that, they're having children,
[00:20:42.800 --> 00:20:46.160]   they're laboring, but what does it result in?
[00:20:46.160 --> 00:20:49.060]   Heartache, division, right?
[00:20:49.060 --> 00:20:50.620]   Thorns and thistles.
[00:20:50.620 --> 00:20:53.620]   They're laboring and they're sweating their brow
[00:20:53.620 --> 00:20:55.500]   and nothing is coming of it.
[00:20:55.500 --> 00:20:59.200]   Right? And so, on the surface, everything looks the same,
[00:20:59.200 --> 00:21:03.660]   but the peace, the shalom of God has been broken.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:07.360]   Right? And so, that's where we get the idea of the Sabbath,
[00:21:07.360 --> 00:21:11.220]   where God's Sabbath, Sabbath basically means rest
[00:21:11.220 --> 00:21:14.560]   or again, the equivalent idea is peace.
[00:21:14.560 --> 00:21:17.020]   So, God enters into the Sabbath, God enters
[00:21:17.020 --> 00:21:21.420]   into his eternal peace, but that peace is broken.
[00:21:21.420 --> 00:21:25.100]   And so, all throughout redemptive history,
[00:21:25.100 --> 00:21:27.800]   God is trying to restore that Sabbath back
[00:21:27.800 --> 00:21:30.000]   into human history.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.400]   Right? Do you follow?
[00:21:33.400 --> 00:21:36.300]   So, the illustration that God uses between a relationship
[00:21:36.300 --> 00:21:38.900]   with the holy God that's broken, immediately results
[00:21:38.900 --> 00:21:41.360]   in a broken relationship between husband and wife,
[00:21:41.360 --> 00:21:44.100]   and then the Sabbath that God brought mankind
[00:21:44.100 --> 00:21:46.000]   into gets broken.
[00:21:46.000 --> 00:21:48.860]   So, the pursuit of salvation
[00:21:48.860 --> 00:21:52.320]   in redemptive history is the pursuit of restoring
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:55.600]   that peace, restoring that shalom.
[00:21:55.600 --> 00:21:56.520]   You follow?
[00:21:56.520 --> 00:22:01.900]   So, this peace offering is the result of the atonement.
[00:22:01.900 --> 00:22:06.860]   So, the constant atonement of sacrifice is a picture
[00:22:06.860 --> 00:22:10.460]   of the atonement and the result of what God does on the cross
[00:22:10.460 --> 00:22:12.060]   that restores our relationship with God.
[00:22:12.060 --> 00:22:14.220]   As a result of it, it restores what?
[00:22:14.220 --> 00:22:16.120]   Our relationship with each other.
[00:22:16.120 --> 00:22:19.060]   Right? That's what it ultimately points to,
[00:22:19.060 --> 00:22:20.920]   that there is no peace with one another
[00:22:20.920 --> 00:22:22.860]   until there is peace with God.
[00:22:22.860 --> 00:22:28.300]   Right? So, the offering was given as a free will offering
[00:22:28.300 --> 00:22:32.620]   in an act of thanksgiving for God's mercies and blessings.
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:37.200]   So, the sharing of the meal only heightened the joyous occasion
[00:22:37.200 --> 00:22:39.500]   that this offering represented.
[00:22:39.500 --> 00:22:44.220]   And eating meat, and I share this
[00:22:44.220 --> 00:22:47.260]   with the burnt offering, was a very rare occasion.
[00:22:47.260 --> 00:22:52.360]   So, whenever they had meat, you know, in our generation,
[00:22:52.360 --> 00:22:54.460]   we eat whatever we want, whatever we want.
[00:22:54.460 --> 00:22:56.900]   So, nothing is that special.
[00:22:56.900 --> 00:23:00.800]   Right? Americans in particular.
[00:23:00.800 --> 00:23:05.200]   But I don't know if anybody would know.
[00:23:05.200 --> 00:23:07.600]   I mean, when I was younger, you know, my parents immigrated
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:13.400]   to the U.S. in 1975, and it was no more than 20 years,
[00:23:13.400 --> 00:23:15.760]   or less than 20 years removed from the war.
[00:23:15.760 --> 00:23:17.800]   And so, Korea was not a very developed country.
[00:23:17.800 --> 00:23:20.840]   And I remember eating meat was huge.
[00:23:20.840 --> 00:23:23.960]   And I can only remember maybe a couple times a year, if that,
[00:23:23.960 --> 00:23:27.160]   only when there was a special guest that came into town.
[00:23:27.160 --> 00:23:29.940]   You know, and then my parents would announce
[00:23:29.940 --> 00:23:31.760]   that we're going to have meat.
[00:23:31.760 --> 00:23:34.800]   Right? Next Thursday, or next month on Tuesday,
[00:23:34.800 --> 00:23:36.240]   we have a guest coming, we're going to have meat.
[00:23:36.240 --> 00:23:39.040]   And usually it's not like the Korean barbecue.
[00:23:39.040 --> 00:23:42.160]   Usually you just get a -- you have meat, and a big chunk
[00:23:42.160 --> 00:23:43.440]   of it is left for the guest,
[00:23:43.440 --> 00:23:45.900]   and then we would have a little tiny piece of meat.
[00:23:45.900 --> 00:23:47.500]   And that was a big deal.
[00:23:47.500 --> 00:23:52.260]   Right? And it wasn't that our family was especially poor.
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:53.860]   You know, because my grandfather,
[00:23:53.860 --> 00:23:56.260]   my mother's side was actually pretty wealthy.
[00:23:56.260 --> 00:23:58.800]   It was just -- that's how poor the country was at that time.
[00:23:58.800 --> 00:24:01.040]   So, I remember very distinctly, like,
[00:24:01.040 --> 00:24:03.760]   what a big deal it was to eat meat.
[00:24:03.760 --> 00:24:05.200]   Back in the '70s.
[00:24:05.200 --> 00:24:07.160]   Right? I mean, now, I mean, everybody eats meat,
[00:24:07.160 --> 00:24:09.060]   and now you're looking for quality meat.
[00:24:09.060 --> 00:24:12.300]   Right? So, eating meat
[00:24:12.300 --> 00:24:15.400]   for fellowship for the Jews was not a common occurrence.
[00:24:15.400 --> 00:24:18.200]   So, the fact that whenever somebody gave the peace
[00:24:18.200 --> 00:24:22.500]   offering, you know, my guess is if their family and friends knew
[00:24:22.500 --> 00:24:24.800]   that they were giving this peace offering, that all
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.400]   of a sudden they had a lot of friends around.
[00:24:26.400 --> 00:24:28.360]   Like, that's what I imagine.
[00:24:28.360 --> 00:24:31.340]   You know? Like, where are you going to give offering?
[00:24:31.340 --> 00:24:32.800]   What kind of offering?
[00:24:32.800 --> 00:24:34.900]   Right? Burnt offerings.
[00:24:34.900 --> 00:24:36.060]   Ah, forget it.
[00:24:36.060 --> 00:24:38.640]   Right? Great offering.
[00:24:38.640 --> 00:24:39.800]   Peace offering.
[00:24:39.800 --> 00:24:41.800]   Right? And they said, can we go?
[00:24:41.800 --> 00:24:45.240]   So, I would imagine that that was kind of like the environment
[00:24:45.240 --> 00:24:47.840]   every time they gave this peace offering, fellowship offering,
[00:24:47.840 --> 00:24:50.800]   that everybody got excited, and they all wanted to participate,
[00:24:50.800 --> 00:24:52.500]   because that's what it signified.
[00:24:52.500 --> 00:24:53.800]   Right? And they got to eat meat.
[00:24:53.800 --> 00:24:56.040]   And we don't know how often this happened,
[00:24:56.040 --> 00:24:58.500]   but whenever it did happen, it was meant
[00:24:58.500 --> 00:25:00.760]   to be a time of celebration.
[00:25:00.760 --> 00:25:06.660]   Right? The significance of this in the New Testament is all over.
[00:25:06.660 --> 00:25:08.960]   I mean, I think we could have spent just two days just talking
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:11.040]   about the significance of this,
[00:25:11.040 --> 00:25:13.240]   because this is peppered throughout all
[00:25:13.240 --> 00:25:14.940]   in the New Testament.
[00:25:14.940 --> 00:25:20.260]   Right? Again, as I mentioned, eating meals, again,
[00:25:20.260 --> 00:25:21.740]   in the Jewish culture, and you see it
[00:25:21.740 --> 00:25:24.300]   in the New Testament, was significant.
[00:25:24.300 --> 00:25:26.700]   So, that's why over and over again you see the Pharisees
[00:25:26.700 --> 00:25:30.500]   constantly having problems with Jesus eating
[00:25:30.500 --> 00:25:33.200]   with the tax collectors.
[00:25:33.200 --> 00:25:36.200]   Right? Or the Gentiles, or with the sinners.
[00:25:36.200 --> 00:25:37.340]   Like, oh, you're having a banquet.
[00:25:37.340 --> 00:25:38.160]   You're eating with them.
[00:25:38.160 --> 00:25:40.860]   So, there's a lot of parables.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:42.540]   There's a lot of teachings and grumblings
[00:25:42.540 --> 00:25:46.760]   about who Jesus was eating with, who Jesus was inviting
[00:25:46.760 --> 00:25:47.560]   to the banquet table.
[00:25:47.560 --> 00:25:49.440]   There's a lot of parables.
[00:25:49.440 --> 00:25:50.440]   Right? I didn't list them here,
[00:25:50.440 --> 00:25:52.460]   but you could probably think of them yourselves.
[00:25:52.460 --> 00:25:56.560]   A lot of Jesus' teachings and parables centers around eating.
[00:25:56.560 --> 00:25:59.300]   Right? Because the eating, to a Jewish mind,
[00:25:59.300 --> 00:26:01.540]   was more than just eating.
[00:26:01.540 --> 00:26:02.440]   It was communing.
[00:26:02.440 --> 00:26:03.500]   It was fellowship.
[00:26:03.500 --> 00:26:05.040]   Right? And that's why the Pharisees were saying,
[00:26:05.040 --> 00:26:06.200]   how can you eat with these people?
[00:26:06.200 --> 00:26:08.540]   Because eating with them basically meant
[00:26:08.540 --> 00:26:11.340]   that you were one with them.
[00:26:11.340 --> 00:26:14.100]   Right? It doesn't mean that today.
[00:26:14.100 --> 00:26:15.600]   If you sat and just had a meal with somebody,
[00:26:15.600 --> 00:26:17.940]   it doesn't mean anything in particular.
[00:26:17.940 --> 00:26:21.260]   But in this culture, you didn't just eat with anybody.
[00:26:21.260 --> 00:26:25.100]   Right? So, in Mark 2, 16, again, and it's not the only place
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.000]   where the Pharisees are grumbling against Jesus.
[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:28.840]   How can you be eating with these people?
[00:26:28.840 --> 00:26:31.340]   How can you identify yourself with these people?
[00:26:31.340 --> 00:26:31.940]   Right? Right?
[00:26:31.940 --> 00:26:35.540]   The first thing he does, he slaughters an animal,
[00:26:35.540 --> 00:26:37.260]   and then they have a banquet.
[00:26:37.260 --> 00:26:39.800]   Right? And again, in a Jewish mind,
[00:26:39.800 --> 00:26:41.540]   they would have immediately thought of the peace offering,
[00:26:41.540 --> 00:26:44.040]   because when you slaughter the animal to eat,
[00:26:44.040 --> 00:26:45.300]   it was the peace offering.
[00:26:45.300 --> 00:26:48.000]   Right? They're reconciling.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:49.100]   God is bringing them back,
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:53.300]   and that was the significance of this peace offering.
[00:26:53.300 --> 00:26:55.340]   Even the last Passover meal.
[00:26:55.340 --> 00:26:57.640]   Right? I think the clearest significance
[00:26:57.640 --> 00:27:00.100]   of the peace offering is the Passover meal.
[00:27:00.100 --> 00:27:03.000]   After they give the sacrifice, they would sit and eat together,
[00:27:03.000 --> 00:27:04.900]   and they would remember what God did
[00:27:04.900 --> 00:27:07.640]   and how he delivered them from the nation of Israel,
[00:27:07.640 --> 00:27:09.160]   but this was meant to be done
[00:27:09.160 --> 00:27:11.740]   in the context of people that you loved.
[00:27:11.740 --> 00:27:16.200]   Right? I'm just going to give a real, like, short plug here.
[00:27:16.200 --> 00:27:21.200]   Okay? This year, for Easter, for Passion Week,
[00:27:21.200 --> 00:27:23.940]   you know how we used to have every morning,
[00:27:23.940 --> 00:27:26.400]   we'd get together and have morning devotions,
[00:27:26.400 --> 00:27:28.740]   and then some of you guys would go to work and things like that.
[00:27:28.740 --> 00:27:31.300]   We decided this year that we're going to do something different.
[00:27:31.300 --> 00:27:33.200]   Instead of having that in the morning,
[00:27:33.200 --> 00:27:34.940]   that on Thursday night,
[00:27:34.940 --> 00:27:38.000]   we're going to practice the Passover meal.
[00:27:38.000 --> 00:27:40.500]   Okay? So Thursday night, again, this is, you know,
[00:27:40.500 --> 00:27:42.940]   whoever can come, and we're going to take sign-ups,
[00:27:42.940 --> 00:27:46.400]   and we're going to ask you to pay your portion of the meal.
[00:27:46.400 --> 00:27:49.300]   Okay? So that you don't sign up and not show up.
[00:27:49.300 --> 00:27:52.040]   We want to make sure that if you're going to sign up.
[00:27:52.040 --> 00:27:54.000]   So on Thursday night, before the Passion Week,
[00:27:54.000 --> 00:27:55.200]   where Thursday night,
[00:27:55.200 --> 00:27:57.200]   where Jesus gets together with his disciples
[00:27:57.200 --> 00:27:59.160]   and they eat the Passover meal,
[00:27:59.160 --> 00:28:03.060]   and then they -- we're going to basically not reenact.
[00:28:03.060 --> 00:28:05.100]   I'm not planning to dress up.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:09.260]   Okay? So we're just going to go over the Passover meal
[00:28:09.260 --> 00:28:10.540]   and what they did,
[00:28:10.540 --> 00:28:12.940]   and then we're going to actually partake in it.
[00:28:12.940 --> 00:28:16.500]   Okay? So -- and then Thursday, and then take some time to pray
[00:28:16.500 --> 00:28:19.200]   to prepare for the next day.
[00:28:19.200 --> 00:28:21.800]   So instead of doing the day-to-day thing in the morning,
[00:28:21.800 --> 00:28:23.640]   we're going to have one day Thursday,
[00:28:23.640 --> 00:28:26.840]   and then we'll have the communion on Good Friday,
[00:28:26.840 --> 00:28:28.140]   on Friday night.
[00:28:28.140 --> 00:28:29.440]   So instead of every day,
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:30.240]   we're going to have Thursday and Friday night.
[00:28:30.240 --> 00:28:32.700]   Okay? So that's just a plug.
[00:28:32.700 --> 00:28:33.700]   We'll make the announcement,
[00:28:33.700 --> 00:28:36.040]   and we'll start taking sign-ups pretty soon.
[00:28:36.040 --> 00:28:39.160]   But again, the clear picture of this Passover peace meal,
[00:28:39.160 --> 00:28:41.700]   fellowship meal, is with the communion.
[00:28:41.700 --> 00:28:45.960]   Right? And 1 Corinthians chapter 11, remember, it says,
[00:28:45.960 --> 00:28:48.160]   "He who does not acknowledge the body of Christ
[00:28:48.160 --> 00:28:49.560]   and eats and drinks the blood,
[00:28:49.560 --> 00:28:52.500]   eats and drinks judgment upon himself."
[00:28:52.500 --> 00:28:55.600]   So, you know, again, you know, people ask --
[00:28:55.600 --> 00:28:58.040]   it seems like it's kind of a trend today
[00:28:58.040 --> 00:28:59.740]   that they want to have communion
[00:28:59.740 --> 00:29:02.340]   at the wedding ceremony or something else,
[00:29:02.340 --> 00:29:04.260]   and I know some churches do that.
[00:29:04.260 --> 00:29:06.040]   At our church, we don't do that.
[00:29:06.040 --> 00:29:07.960]   Right? And the reason why we don't do that
[00:29:07.960 --> 00:29:10.960]   is because communion was meant to be done
[00:29:10.960 --> 00:29:13.760]   in the context of the whole body of Christ.
[00:29:13.760 --> 00:29:15.560]   Right? It was to acknowledge the body.
[00:29:15.560 --> 00:29:17.500]   It was not meant to be something personal
[00:29:17.500 --> 00:29:20.500]   between you and God and between you and your husband.
[00:29:20.500 --> 00:29:21.860]   It's meant to be done in the context
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:23.200]   of the whole body of Christ.
[00:29:23.200 --> 00:29:27.500]   Right? And so the communion is a time where we remember.
[00:29:27.500 --> 00:29:29.560]   It says if you have a relationship
[00:29:29.560 --> 00:29:31.560]   that you haven't reconciled, or you're holding a grudge,
[00:29:31.560 --> 00:29:33.440]   somebody holds a grudge against you,
[00:29:33.440 --> 00:29:35.600]   that every time you come into the communion table
[00:29:35.600 --> 00:29:37.600]   and you don't deal with that,
[00:29:37.600 --> 00:29:39.900]   it says you drink and eat judgment upon yourself,
[00:29:39.900 --> 00:29:41.840]   that you completely ignore the body of Christ.
[00:29:41.840 --> 00:29:44.200]   So it's a reminder to us
[00:29:44.200 --> 00:29:45.840]   that because of the blood of Christ,
[00:29:45.840 --> 00:29:48.000]   he commands us to be reconciled
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:49.840]   with our brothers and sisters. Right?
[00:29:49.840 --> 00:29:52.140]   So that's -- every time we have communion,
[00:29:52.140 --> 00:29:53.160]   we're reminded of that.
[00:29:53.160 --> 00:29:55.200]   Again, this is the peace offering.
[00:29:55.200 --> 00:29:56.500]   Right?
[00:29:56.500 --> 00:29:58.440]   The offering not only signified peace with God,
[00:29:58.440 --> 00:30:02.640]   but also peace with others as a result,
[00:30:02.640 --> 00:30:04.880]   that the only reason why we're able to have fellowship
[00:30:04.880 --> 00:30:07.320]   is because of what Christ has done on the cross.
[00:30:07.320 --> 00:30:08.540]   Right?
[00:30:08.540 --> 00:30:12.120]   So in Acts 10, 13 to 16,
[00:30:12.120 --> 00:30:16.040]   remember that incident with Peter where he has a dream.
[00:30:16.040 --> 00:30:19.220]   He gets -- goes into a trance, and Jesus says --
[00:30:19.220 --> 00:30:20.940]   he looks at all these unclean animals
[00:30:20.940 --> 00:30:22.220]   that are coming down from heaven,
[00:30:22.220 --> 00:30:23.440]   and he says, "Eat."
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:25.440]   And here's a faithful Jew all his life.
[00:30:25.440 --> 00:30:26.740]   He never ate anything unclean.
[00:30:26.740 --> 00:30:28.280]   He says, "I can't do that."
[00:30:28.280 --> 00:30:29.920]   Jesus himself tells him to eat,
[00:30:29.920 --> 00:30:32.480]   and he's -- again, Peter is telling him,
[00:30:32.480 --> 00:30:34.240]   "I can't do that." Right?
[00:30:34.240 --> 00:30:37.140]   Peter has a tendency to put his foot in his mouth.
[00:30:37.140 --> 00:30:39.840]   He forgot what he did before. Right?
[00:30:39.840 --> 00:30:42.580]   Then Jesus basically says, "Rise and eat."
[00:30:42.580 --> 00:30:45.080]   "By no means, Lord," verse 14,
[00:30:45.080 --> 00:30:47.480]   "for I have never eaten anything that is uncommon or unclean."
[00:30:47.480 --> 00:30:50.880]   And the voice came to him again, said a second time,
[00:30:50.880 --> 00:30:52.980]   "What God has made clean, do not call common.
[00:30:52.980 --> 00:30:54.420]   This happened three times,
[00:30:54.420 --> 00:30:56.340]   and the thing was taken up at once to heaven."
[00:30:56.340 --> 00:31:00.080]   So this dream wasn't about the animals.
[00:31:00.080 --> 00:31:03.380]   What did this apply to?
[00:31:03.380 --> 00:31:04.840]   Remember?
[00:31:04.840 --> 00:31:06.180]   The very next scene,
[00:31:06.180 --> 00:31:10.080]   he gets called to Cornelius' house, right,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:11.840]   which was a Gentile.
[00:31:11.840 --> 00:31:14.540]   And so he goes there, and so the application of that
[00:31:14.540 --> 00:31:18.380]   was that the Gentiles are no longer unclean.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:20.380]   They have been made clean by the blood of Christ.
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:21.800]   So if you're a brother in Christ,
[00:31:21.800 --> 00:31:22.880]   you have been made clean.
[00:31:22.880 --> 00:31:26.620]   So God calls Peter to go, basically, right,
[00:31:26.620 --> 00:31:28.720]   and lay hands on him, and then he becomes a believer,
[00:31:28.720 --> 00:31:32.280]   and he gets baptized, him and his household, right?
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:36.780]   So again, the significance of these Jews and Gentiles
[00:31:36.780 --> 00:31:38.240]   could never have a meal together
[00:31:38.240 --> 00:31:40.420]   because they would have been considered unclean.
[00:31:40.420 --> 00:31:42.720]   Jew would have been defiled.
[00:31:42.720 --> 00:31:45.740]   But Jesus says because of his blood sacrifice,
[00:31:45.740 --> 00:31:47.220]   they are no longer considered unclean.
[00:31:47.220 --> 00:31:51.980]   What Jesus calls clean no longer calls unclean, right?
[00:31:51.980 --> 00:31:53.880]   That's what this signified.
[00:31:53.880 --> 00:31:55.620]   Again, Ephesians 2, 14 to 19.
[00:31:55.620 --> 00:31:58.880]   "For he himself is our peace, who has made us both one
[00:31:58.880 --> 00:32:00.440]   and has broken down in his flesh
[00:32:00.440 --> 00:32:02.480]   the dividing wall of hostility.
[00:32:02.480 --> 00:32:04.880]   By abolishing the law of commandments and ordinances,
[00:32:04.880 --> 00:32:06.920]   that he might create in himself one new man
[00:32:06.920 --> 00:32:09.540]   in place of two, so making peace,
[00:32:09.540 --> 00:32:11.820]   and might reconcile us both to God in one body
[00:32:11.820 --> 00:32:14.320]   through the cross, thereby killing the hostility.
[00:32:14.320 --> 00:32:16.720]   And he came and preached peace to you who are far off
[00:32:16.720 --> 00:32:18.580]   and peace to those who are near.
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:20.620]   For through him, we both have access
[00:32:20.620 --> 00:32:21.780]   in one spirit to the Father.
[00:32:21.780 --> 00:32:24.240]   So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:32:24.240 --> 00:32:25.980]   but you are fellow citizens with the saints
[00:32:25.980 --> 00:32:28.980]   and members of the household of God."
[00:32:28.980 --> 00:32:30.380]   And let me reiterate.
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:35.180]   You cannot come to God in prayer
[00:32:35.180 --> 00:32:37.680]   if you refuse to be reconciled to your brother.
[00:32:37.680 --> 00:32:41.380]   Because at the core of the Lord's prayer,
[00:32:41.380 --> 00:32:44.180]   it says, "Forgive us our debts as what?
[00:32:44.180 --> 00:32:47.040]   We forgive our debtors."
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.720]   So you cannot come to God and ask for forgiveness
[00:32:49.720 --> 00:32:51.340]   if you refuse to forgive.
[00:32:52.340 --> 00:32:55.040]   It is at the core of our salvation.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:32:57.680]   Because he forgave us, he commands us
[00:32:57.680 --> 00:32:58.500]   to forgive our brothers.
[00:32:58.500 --> 00:33:00.340]   He said, "Before you go to the altar,
[00:33:00.340 --> 00:33:02.440]   if you notice that somebody has something against you,
[00:33:02.440 --> 00:33:03.880]   what does he say?
[00:33:03.880 --> 00:33:07.580]   Drop and go reconcile with that brother first,
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:09.240]   and then come back to the altar."
[00:33:09.240 --> 00:33:11.440]   So in other words, you can't come to the altar
[00:33:11.440 --> 00:33:14.140]   until you've been reconciled, right?
[00:33:14.140 --> 00:33:18.180]   So our horizontal relationship
[00:33:18.180 --> 00:33:20.080]   affects our vertical relationship.
[00:33:20.080 --> 00:33:21.280]   Our vertical relationship
[00:33:21.280 --> 00:33:24.280]   affects our horizontal relationship, right?
[00:33:24.280 --> 00:33:27.800]   So the expression of our devotion to God
[00:33:27.800 --> 00:33:30.280]   is expressed through love,
[00:33:30.280 --> 00:33:32.440]   brothers and sisters, right?
[00:33:32.440 --> 00:33:34.580]   Now it may not spell this out.
[00:33:34.580 --> 00:33:36.700]   Like in this offering, God doesn't spell out
[00:33:36.700 --> 00:33:38.340]   that this is what I mean by it.
[00:33:38.340 --> 00:33:39.540]   But you can clearly see,
[00:33:39.540 --> 00:33:42.280]   if this is what the Israelites were acting out,
[00:33:42.280 --> 00:33:43.880]   every time they had a peace offering,
[00:33:43.880 --> 00:33:46.740]   they offer this to God, and as a celebration,
[00:33:46.740 --> 00:33:48.100]   they would have a picnic.
[00:33:48.100 --> 00:33:50.400]   And they would know, right?
[00:33:50.400 --> 00:33:55.400]   Just by acting it out, just by eating at the tabernacle,
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:59.100]   that they're doing this because of that animal sacrifice.
[00:33:59.100 --> 00:34:02.200]   And so when Christ comes,
[00:34:02.200 --> 00:34:05.100]   and he gives his life as a living sacrifice,
[00:34:05.100 --> 00:34:08.000]   the Jewish community automatically understood
[00:34:08.000 --> 00:34:10.100]   that we've become one because of this.
[00:34:10.100 --> 00:34:13.440]   Because they acted it out.
[00:34:13.440 --> 00:34:15.600]   They ate it, they tasted it.
[00:34:16.600 --> 00:34:19.600]   But ultimately, it points to the marriage supper of the Lamb.
[00:34:19.600 --> 00:34:22.900]   Isaiah 9, 7, it says,
[00:34:22.900 --> 00:34:24.500]   "Of the increase of his government and peace,
[00:34:24.500 --> 00:34:25.400]   "there will be no end.
[00:34:25.400 --> 00:34:27.300]   "On the throne of David and over his kingdom,
[00:34:27.300 --> 00:34:30.000]   "to establish it, to uphold it with justice,
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   "and with the righteousness from this time forth
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.400]   "and forevermore, the zeal of the Lord of hosts
[00:34:34.400 --> 00:34:36.300]   "will do this."
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.000]   Now we have a lot of weddings at our church,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.500]   and one of the significance of this wedding is
[00:34:41.500 --> 00:34:43.300]   when two Christians get together,
[00:34:43.300 --> 00:34:45.600]   and they have a covenant relationship,
[00:34:45.600 --> 00:34:47.100]   what happens afterwards?
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:51.600]   What happens afterwards?
[00:34:51.600 --> 00:34:54.600]   You just pack up your bags and go home?
[00:34:54.600 --> 00:34:57.300]   There's a reception, right?
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:34:58.600]   There's a banquet.
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:34:59.700]   So every wedding, I don't know,
[00:34:59.700 --> 00:35:01.100]   I've never been to a wedding
[00:35:01.100 --> 00:35:03.200]   that doesn't have a banquet afterwards.
[00:35:03.200 --> 00:35:05.500]   If you don't, you're gonna get cussed out, right?
[00:35:05.500 --> 00:35:08.600]   'Cause you expect, you expect,
[00:35:08.600 --> 00:35:10.400]   oh, is that, oh, I'm sorry,
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:14.300]   you expect, oh, was that offensive?
[00:35:14.300 --> 00:35:17.700]   'Cause you expect it, right?
[00:35:17.700 --> 00:35:18.800]   Have you ever been to a wedding
[00:35:18.800 --> 00:35:20.400]   where there wasn't a banquet afterwards?
[00:35:20.400 --> 00:35:22.600]   I mean, the kind of banquet obviously
[00:35:22.600 --> 00:35:25.400]   may be different from group to group,
[00:35:25.400 --> 00:35:27.600]   but there is an understanding
[00:35:27.600 --> 00:35:29.100]   with this covenant relationship,
[00:35:29.100 --> 00:35:32.400]   there is a celebration, some kind of celebration, right?
[00:35:32.400 --> 00:35:34.000]   Again, that celebration may look different
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:35.500]   from culture to culture,
[00:35:35.500 --> 00:35:38.400]   but in particularly in a Christian wedding, right,
[00:35:38.400 --> 00:35:40.300]   when the covenant is made,
[00:35:40.300 --> 00:35:45.700]   the whole thing of the Christian ceremony, right,
[00:35:45.700 --> 00:35:47.600]   and a lot of times when we think of the Christian ceremony,
[00:35:47.600 --> 00:35:49.600]   we think it stops with the worship.
[00:35:49.600 --> 00:35:53.100]   You know, when we say amen and here's husband and wife,
[00:35:53.100 --> 00:35:54.000]   and then they walk down,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   okay, now we're done with the holy stuff, let's party.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:35:57.900]   You know what I mean?
[00:35:57.900 --> 00:35:59.800]   It was almost kind of like there's a separation
[00:35:59.800 --> 00:36:04.600]   between the holy time and then the unholy time, right?
[00:36:04.600 --> 00:36:07.400]   (congregation laughing)
[00:36:07.400 --> 00:36:08.500]   But the Christian wedding,
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.000]   the whole thing is a Christian celebration
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.100]   because of what happens in the ceremony
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:18.400]   that we're able to have this fellowship, right?
[00:36:18.400 --> 00:36:20.600]   And it was meant to be fellowship,
[00:36:20.600 --> 00:36:24.000]   not, okay, now I'm done, the covenant is done,
[00:36:24.000 --> 00:36:26.400]   so let's go have some fun, right?
[00:36:26.400 --> 00:36:29.100]   So the marriage ceremony itself really points
[00:36:29.100 --> 00:36:34.500]   to what the Israelites were doing for hundreds of years,
[00:36:34.500 --> 00:36:39.000]   right, restoration with God needs to banquet with mankind,
[00:36:39.000 --> 00:36:41.500]   and then we see that in Revelations 19, 6 through 10.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:43.200]   "Then I heard what seemed to be the voice
[00:36:43.200 --> 00:36:46.700]   "of a great multitude, like the roar of many waters,
[00:36:46.700 --> 00:36:48.700]   "like the sound of mighty peals of thunder,
[00:36:48.700 --> 00:36:51.800]   "crying out hallelujah for the Lord our God Almighty reigns.
[00:36:51.800 --> 00:36:53.800]   "Let us rejoice and exalt and give him the glory,
[00:36:53.800 --> 00:36:55.700]   "for the marriage of the Lamb has come,
[00:36:55.700 --> 00:36:58.000]   "and his bride has made herself ready.
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:37:00.600]   "It has granted her to clothe herself with fine linen,
[00:37:00.600 --> 00:37:02.600]   "bright and pure, for the fine linen
[00:37:02.600 --> 00:37:04.200]   "is the righteous deeds of the saints,
[00:37:04.200 --> 00:37:06.300]   "and the angel said to me, write this,
[00:37:06.300 --> 00:37:08.100]   "'Blessed are those who are invited
[00:37:08.100 --> 00:37:10.000]   "'to the marriage supper of the Lamb.'
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:12.600]   "And he said to me, 'These are the true words of God.'
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:14.800]   "Then I fell down at his feet to worship him,
[00:37:14.800 --> 00:37:16.500]   "but he said to me, 'You must not do that.
[00:37:16.500 --> 00:37:18.300]   "'I am a fellow servant with you
[00:37:18.300 --> 00:37:20.100]   "'and your brothers who told you the testimony of Jesus.
[00:37:20.100 --> 00:37:22.900]   "'Worship God, for the testimony of Jesus
[00:37:22.900 --> 00:37:24.500]   "'is the spirit of prophecy.'"
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:27.200]   So again, in Revelations 19, 6 through 10,
[00:37:27.200 --> 00:37:30.100]   it points to the very end when Christ comes
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:32.700]   to redeem his church, right?
[00:37:32.700 --> 00:37:34.900]   So the scripture talks about how we are saved,
[00:37:34.900 --> 00:37:38.200]   we are being saved, we will ultimately be saved,
[00:37:38.200 --> 00:37:40.800]   where the final conclusion of everything
[00:37:40.800 --> 00:37:43.700]   that he's done on the cross is going to be actualized
[00:37:43.700 --> 00:37:46.400]   when Christ comes and he establishes kingdom.
[00:37:46.400 --> 00:37:48.400]   And so his establishing of the kingdom
[00:37:48.400 --> 00:37:50.900]   is described as what?
[00:37:50.900 --> 00:37:55.700]   The supper of the Lamb, right?
[00:37:55.700 --> 00:37:58.800]   It's described as a supper of the Lamb.
[00:37:58.800 --> 00:38:01.000]   That's how restoration and salvation
[00:38:01.000 --> 00:38:03.500]   is ultimately described in the scripture,
[00:38:03.500 --> 00:38:04.900]   that that's where he's taken us,
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:07.300]   to this banqueting table, right?
[00:38:07.300 --> 00:38:09.000]   I don't know, we don't sing that song anymore,
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:10.400]   but what is it called?
[00:38:10.400 --> 00:38:12.700]   Something, something, banqueting table.
[00:38:12.700 --> 00:38:14.400]   You guys know that song?
[00:38:14.400 --> 00:38:15.700]   Really, you don't know that song?
[00:38:15.700 --> 00:38:18.700]   Okay, we should sing it.
[00:38:18.700 --> 00:38:20.400]   But anyway, we used to sing that song all the time.
[00:38:20.400 --> 00:38:23.700]   It's like, "Brought us to the banqueting table."
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.000]   Anyway, anyway, there's a song that talks about that,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.200]   but basically the scripture describes
[00:38:29.200 --> 00:38:31.600]   the end conclusion of our salvation
[00:38:31.600 --> 00:38:33.800]   is to bring us to the banqueting table,
[00:38:33.800 --> 00:38:38.000]   and that's what this peace offering ultimately pointed to.
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:43.800]   It's not just talking about how we're not going to hell.
[00:38:43.800 --> 00:38:47.200]   And a lot of people who understand salvation
[00:38:47.200 --> 00:38:49.400]   in a very elementary way of,
[00:38:49.400 --> 00:38:52.700]   "Okay, now we're not just going to hell."
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:56.200]   And then that's how they live their Christian life, right?
[00:38:56.200 --> 00:38:58.500]   That all they understand about their salvation
[00:38:58.500 --> 00:38:59.400]   is, "I'm not going to hell.
[00:38:59.400 --> 00:39:01.700]   I'm not being judged by God."
[00:39:01.700 --> 00:39:04.500]   But when scripture says that he came to give us life
[00:39:04.500 --> 00:39:06.500]   and to give us life abundantly,
[00:39:06.500 --> 00:39:09.200]   that he brought us from darkness into light,
[00:39:09.200 --> 00:39:10.900]   and the fact that we are in light
[00:39:10.900 --> 00:39:13.300]   is to bring us into celebration.
[00:39:13.300 --> 00:39:16.900]   So if Christian life isn't characterized by celebration
[00:39:16.900 --> 00:39:21.100]   and a banquet, that's why it becomes a dread, right?
[00:39:21.100 --> 00:39:23.100]   And all the commandments of God and all the dues
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:25.000]   and all the things that we're called to do,
[00:39:25.000 --> 00:39:27.400]   that somebody who doesn't understand
[00:39:27.400 --> 00:39:30.700]   that our salvation ultimately is bringing us
[00:39:30.700 --> 00:39:32.200]   to the banqueting table,
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:38.400]   will consider any restrictions in their life as a dread.
[00:39:38.400 --> 00:39:43.700]   Because you look at joy as the world, right?
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:47.600]   And if you look at salvation as just not being judged,
[00:39:47.600 --> 00:39:50.600]   and then you find life and joy in the world,
[00:39:50.600 --> 00:39:53.000]   anything that restricts you from the world
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.700]   is going to be a dread, right?
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:58.700]   But the proper understanding of salvation is
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.300]   he saves us from darkness to bring us to light,
[00:40:02.300 --> 00:40:06.300]   to bring us to the celebration table, right?
[00:40:06.300 --> 00:40:07.700]   And to do this together,
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:09.200]   and that's what the church is meant to be.
[00:40:09.200 --> 00:40:12.300]   That's why worship is central, right?
[00:40:12.300 --> 00:40:14.100]   It is not just a part of our walk with God.
[00:40:14.100 --> 00:40:16.900]   It is central because this is where we find sustenance.
[00:40:16.900 --> 00:40:18.400]   This is where we find life.
[00:40:18.400 --> 00:40:20.300]   And anything that prevents us
[00:40:20.300 --> 00:40:22.800]   from worshiping God in spirit and in truth,
[00:40:22.800 --> 00:40:28.500]   that's where, right, that's where your dread should be, right?
[00:40:28.500 --> 00:40:29.800]   Because if you find life in Christ,
[00:40:29.800 --> 00:40:32.300]   anything that prevents you from coming to Christ
[00:40:32.300 --> 00:40:35.700]   should be the very thing that you dread, right?
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:38.800]   If we understand our salvation correctly.
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.900]   So as you mature in your faith, sin, right?
[00:40:43.900 --> 00:40:49.300]   Sin is what keeps you from Christ, right?
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:50.800]   So anything that prevents you
[00:40:50.800 --> 00:40:53.000]   from wholeheartedly loving Christ
[00:40:53.000 --> 00:40:55.500]   is the very reason why you feel this dread,
[00:40:55.500 --> 00:40:57.300]   you feel this guilt, you feel this,
[00:40:57.300 --> 00:40:58.800]   whatever it is that you feel,
[00:40:58.800 --> 00:41:01.600]   is because, again, you have an incomplete
[00:41:01.600 --> 00:41:03.900]   and immature understanding of your salvation.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:06.700]   So this peace offering, every time they got together
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:09.500]   and they celebrated, they understood
[00:41:09.500 --> 00:41:13.700]   that God's mercy led them to this banqueting table, right?
[00:41:13.700 --> 00:41:16.900]   Hopefully, again, as we understand it more and more,
[00:41:16.900 --> 00:41:20.300]   that that would really sink in, right?
[00:41:20.300 --> 00:41:22.600]   God brought life, right?
[00:41:22.600 --> 00:41:26.100]   He meant to bring life, not dread, right?
[00:41:26.100 --> 00:41:28.800]   And if that's how you feel about your walk with God,
[00:41:28.800 --> 00:41:30.500]   it's because you don't fully understand
[00:41:30.500 --> 00:41:32.800]   what it is that you have, right?
[00:41:32.800 --> 00:41:34.000]   And you need to take a step back
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.200]   and really take a close look at
[00:41:36.200 --> 00:41:39.200]   why you are running to the world rather than to Christ.
[00:41:39.200 --> 00:41:42.400]   What do you think, what do you believe about the world
[00:41:42.400 --> 00:41:44.000]   and what do you believe about God
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:46.600]   that causes you, when you have free time,
[00:41:46.600 --> 00:41:48.500]   to run to the world rather than to Christ?
[00:41:48.500 --> 00:41:52.800]   If you believe that true life is in Christ, right?
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.500]   So the discussion questions today,
[00:41:55.500 --> 00:41:57.600]   it's more of an application.
[00:41:57.600 --> 00:41:59.700]   Number one, do you think you are being intentional
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:02.600]   in fellowshipping with brothers and sisters at church
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:04.500]   or just hoping that someone else would initiate?
[00:42:04.500 --> 00:42:06.000]   Okay, and this is something that,
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:08.600]   even though Christ has made us one, right,
[00:42:08.600 --> 00:42:11.200]   just like in a marriage, you know,
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:13.500]   when they get together, he said, you know,
[00:42:13.500 --> 00:42:16.600]   you become one because of the covenant, legally.
[00:42:16.600 --> 00:42:17.800]   And for the rest of your life,
[00:42:17.800 --> 00:42:20.500]   you're working to become one, right?
[00:42:20.500 --> 00:42:22.400]   Sharing your finances, sharing your space,
[00:42:22.400 --> 00:42:26.600]   sharing, you know, your time, whatever decisions you make.
[00:42:26.600 --> 00:42:28.000]   So you're learning to become one.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   So it's no different in the church.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.600]   We've become one because of the blood of Christ
[00:42:32.600 --> 00:42:34.500]   and part of sanctification is learning
[00:42:34.500 --> 00:42:38.000]   to become one in every way, right?
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:39.900]   How do you function in a church
[00:42:39.900 --> 00:42:41.700]   where you have different personalities
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.100]   and different opinions and people who are passive
[00:42:45.100 --> 00:42:46.400]   and people who are aggressive
[00:42:46.400 --> 00:42:49.100]   and, you know, people have different hobbies
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.000]   and different background, different education,
[00:42:51.000 --> 00:42:53.200]   different finances, and yet we're all
[00:42:53.200 --> 00:42:55.300]   in the same church sharing lives together,
[00:42:55.300 --> 00:42:57.400]   working together for the kingdom of God.
[00:42:57.400 --> 00:43:00.000]   It requires a lot of work.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.300]   It requires humbling.
[00:43:02.300 --> 00:43:04.000]   It requires communication.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:05.100]   It requires talking.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:06.800]   It requires humility.
[00:43:06.800 --> 00:43:09.500]   It requires sanctification, right?
[00:43:09.500 --> 00:43:13.200]   You can't come into church and remain the way you are
[00:43:13.200 --> 00:43:15.900]   and expect fellowship to be good.
[00:43:15.900 --> 00:43:17.900]   Fellowship, just like a good marriage,
[00:43:17.900 --> 00:43:20.700]   requires sanctification, right?
[00:43:20.700 --> 00:43:23.400]   So fellowship requires work.
[00:43:23.400 --> 00:43:27.500]   Like God made us one and then we are working to become one.
[00:43:27.500 --> 00:43:30.000]   So that's number one question is,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:31.800]   is fellowship something when you look at
[00:43:31.800 --> 00:43:34.000]   that you're hoping that would happen
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:36.600]   or is it something that you're actually pursuing?
[00:43:36.600 --> 00:43:39.200]   Okay, number two, are there any broken relationship
[00:43:39.200 --> 00:43:41.900]   that you need to be reconciled with?
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:45.500]   What steps have you taken to reconcile with them?
[00:43:45.500 --> 00:43:47.100]   What is the responsibility of a Christian
[00:43:47.100 --> 00:43:48.600]   if the offended or offending party
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:51.400]   does not wish to reconcile?
[00:43:51.400 --> 00:43:53.800]   Okay, so we may look at that.
[00:43:53.800 --> 00:43:58.200]   Again, hopefully you guys have some good discussions on this.
[00:43:58.200 --> 00:43:59.600]   Like what is the response?
[00:43:59.600 --> 00:44:02.400]   I'm sure a lot of you guys have very specific application
[00:44:02.400 --> 00:44:04.400]   of this that you want to reconcile,
[00:44:04.400 --> 00:44:06.300]   but the other person does not make any effort
[00:44:06.300 --> 00:44:08.600]   and you've given it a try and it doesn't.
[00:44:08.600 --> 00:44:12.200]   So do you just kind of say, "Forget it, right?
[00:44:12.200 --> 00:44:13.700]   It's not my responsibility anymore."
[00:44:13.700 --> 00:44:16.600]   So what is the responsibility of a Christian
[00:44:16.600 --> 00:44:18.600]   if it is not being reciprocated?
[00:44:18.600 --> 00:44:22.000]   Okay, are there any specific things that you can think of?
[00:44:22.000 --> 00:44:24.800]   Right, number three, is there someone you can think of
[00:44:24.800 --> 00:44:27.200]   that you can individually and as a group
[00:44:27.200 --> 00:44:29.500]   help them be brought into more intimate fellowship
[00:44:29.500 --> 00:44:31.900]   of the church?
[00:44:31.900 --> 00:44:33.600]   Some of you guys who've been here longer,
[00:44:33.600 --> 00:44:36.600]   some of you guys who are better connected than others,
[00:44:36.600 --> 00:44:39.800]   you may observe that again as a church is growing,
[00:44:39.800 --> 00:44:41.500]   there's always going to be people on the outskirts.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.000]   Are there people that you're looking at, right,
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:48.000]   that may need your help to help in fellowship?
[00:44:48.000 --> 00:44:50.700]   Just like if you see your brother or sister,
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.900]   blood brother, blood sister who are struggling,
[00:44:52.900 --> 00:44:55.300]   being intentional about helping them out.
[00:44:55.300 --> 00:44:58.200]   If we are brothers and sisters in the church,
[00:44:58.200 --> 00:45:00.000]   do we just watch them from a distance and say,
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:02.700]   "Well, that's the welcome team's responsibility,"
[00:45:02.700 --> 00:45:04.600]   or, "That's the responsibility of these people
[00:45:04.600 --> 00:45:06.400]   or those people," right?
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:08.400]   Is there anybody specifically that you can think of
[00:45:08.400 --> 00:45:10.900]   that you can individually and as a group
[00:45:10.900 --> 00:45:14.100]   be intentional about reaching out to them?
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:19.000]   I can tell you that our church has a lot of unbelievers
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:21.500]   who are entering into the church right now, right?
[00:45:21.500 --> 00:45:23.100]   And the reason why that's happening is because
[00:45:23.100 --> 00:45:26.100]   many of you are being active in your faith, you know?
[00:45:26.100 --> 00:45:27.200]   And so I'm encouraged to see that.
[00:45:27.200 --> 00:45:29.200]   I'm encouraged, like, we have so many people
[00:45:29.200 --> 00:45:31.300]   who are bringing their coworkers,
[00:45:31.300 --> 00:45:35.000]   brothers and sisters, and various relationships.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:36.600]   And so there's a lot of non-Christians.
[00:45:36.600 --> 00:45:42.200]   So we actually started an outreach group in the church
[00:45:42.200 --> 00:45:44.600]   just to focus our attention on the non-Christians
[00:45:44.600 --> 00:45:45.500]   who are coming into the church.
[00:45:45.500 --> 00:45:47.300]   So they started a prayer meeting recently,
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.600]   and then the next step is to actively reach out to them.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:53.000]   So we're thankful that that is happening.
[00:45:53.000 --> 00:45:55.900]   But as a result of that, that's not something
[00:45:55.900 --> 00:45:57.400]   that a few people in the church, like,
[00:45:57.400 --> 00:46:00.000]   "Oh, we have six, seven people who are responsible for that.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:01.500]   We just give it to them."
[00:46:01.500 --> 00:46:03.700]   Everybody in the church has to be aware
[00:46:03.700 --> 00:46:05.200]   that there are non-Christians coming to the church.
[00:46:05.200 --> 00:46:06.800]   And then there's very young Christians
[00:46:06.800 --> 00:46:11.100]   walking into the church who've never studied the Bible, right?
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:13.500]   Some of you guys have been at the church long enough
[00:46:13.500 --> 00:46:17.700]   where you know how to do inductive Bible study, right?
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:21.000]   And I know that even in this room, you know,
[00:46:21.000 --> 00:46:22.100]   some of you guys are sitting here,
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:26.000]   you've never, like, systematically studied the Bible,
[00:46:26.000 --> 00:46:27.900]   and then the first book you study is Revelation,
[00:46:27.900 --> 00:46:30.300]   and then the next book you study is the book of Leviticus.
[00:46:30.300 --> 00:46:32.900]   So, like, "Oh, my gosh, this is hard."
[00:46:32.900 --> 00:46:34.200]   And I don't blame you, right?
[00:46:34.200 --> 00:46:37.800]   If I started seminary with Leviticus and Revelation,
[00:46:37.800 --> 00:46:40.700]   I might have quit, right?
[00:46:40.700 --> 00:46:43.200]   But those of you guys who've been at church
[00:46:43.200 --> 00:46:46.700]   or been trained and you know how to do that,
[00:46:46.700 --> 00:46:47.900]   I know some of you guys may be thinking,
[00:46:47.900 --> 00:46:49.900]   "Oh, it'd be great if the leaders did this."
[00:46:49.900 --> 00:46:52.300]   I mean, we're doing as much as we can.
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:54.700]   We need you guys to be active.
[00:46:54.700 --> 00:46:56.800]   If you have people around you that you are aware of,
[00:46:56.800 --> 00:46:58.200]   and I'm encouraged to see that.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:02.200]   I see at the cafe, I see some of you guys
[00:47:02.200 --> 00:47:05.500]   who are actually meeting up with people on a regular basis
[00:47:05.500 --> 00:47:07.900]   just to teach them how to do quiet time, right?
[00:47:07.900 --> 00:47:09.700]   Teach them how to do inductive study and go into it.
[00:47:09.700 --> 00:47:11.500]   I'm really encouraged to see that.
[00:47:11.500 --> 00:47:12.900]   So, I want to encourage you guys,
[00:47:12.900 --> 00:47:14.800]   when you see people like that, instead of waiting,
[00:47:14.800 --> 00:47:18.100]   "Why don't the church do something?"
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:19.700]   Bring them aside, right?
[00:47:19.700 --> 00:47:21.700]   Meet with them before Bible study,
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:23.900]   or meet with them, you know, at some time
[00:47:23.900 --> 00:47:25.700]   and sit down with them and do quiet time with them
[00:47:25.700 --> 00:47:27.400]   in the morning, right?
[00:47:27.400 --> 00:47:28.300]   Show them how to do it.
[00:47:28.300 --> 00:47:30.700]   Show them what you know, right?
[00:47:30.700 --> 00:47:34.000]   Because if you wait for the church, the leaders to do it,
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:37.000]   I mean, when will we do this, right?
[00:47:37.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   I mean, we're kind of at capacity,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   even with the new pastors coming on.
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   So, those of you guys who know how to do it,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:44.400]   I really want to strongly encourage you
[00:47:44.400 --> 00:47:46.000]   to be deliberate about reaching out to people
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:48.700]   because we have a lot of people coming into church,
[00:47:48.700 --> 00:47:51.500]   and we can't do this discipleship ourselves.
[00:47:51.500 --> 00:47:54.000]   The church has to be actively involved, okay?
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:54.800]   So, that's what that is.
[00:47:54.800 --> 00:47:57.600]   I'm asking you guys to be deliberate in your small groups
[00:47:57.600 --> 00:48:01.200]   to discuss and to reach out and identify who they are,
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.700]   pray for them, and to be active and reach out
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.100]   individually and together, okay?
[00:48:06.100 --> 00:48:07.900]   So, today's discussion is going to be
[00:48:07.900 --> 00:48:09.200]   primarily centered around that.
[00:48:09.200 --> 00:48:10.000]   It's about fellowship.
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:11.900]   So, again, if you've been sitting around
[00:48:11.900 --> 00:48:14.500]   waiting for somebody else to reach out to you,
[00:48:14.500 --> 00:48:16.700]   I guarantee you there's other people sitting around you
[00:48:16.700 --> 00:48:19.200]   hoping that you would do the same, right?
[00:48:19.200 --> 00:48:21.300]   We have communion with God.
[00:48:21.300 --> 00:48:24.100]   So, every single person who has communion with God
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.200]   has whatever it is that you need
[00:48:26.200 --> 00:48:28.700]   to actively reach out to other people.
[00:48:28.700 --> 00:48:30.700]   So, I hope that you guys can take some time
[00:48:30.700 --> 00:48:35.500]   to spur one another on to have a lively discussion on this
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:38.500]   and apply this in an active way.
[00:48:38.500 --> 00:48:39.300]   So, let me pray first,
[00:48:39.300 --> 00:48:42.000]   and then I'll have you guys get into your groups.
[00:48:42.000 --> 00:48:50.700]   Heavenly Father, we want to thank you again.
[00:48:50.700 --> 00:48:51.700]   We thank you, Father God,
[00:48:51.700 --> 00:48:54.600]   that because of the blood of Christ,
[00:48:54.600 --> 00:48:59.600]   that even in our weaknesses
[00:48:59.600 --> 00:49:03.000]   and times of pride and selfishness
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.100]   and having a hard time at times, Lord God,
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:10.400]   even understanding between husband and wife,
[00:49:10.400 --> 00:49:13.500]   to participate in a large group of people
[00:49:13.500 --> 00:49:20.100]   where we have different personalities and interests.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:21.300]   Humanly speaking, Lord God,
[00:49:21.300 --> 00:49:24.400]   it is a task beyond us.
[00:49:24.400 --> 00:49:28.100]   But we thank you that because of the blood of Christ,
[00:49:28.100 --> 00:49:30.100]   that you call us, command us,
[00:49:30.100 --> 00:49:33.000]   encourage us to become one,
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.300]   that we would practice the love that you practice on us,
[00:49:37.300 --> 00:49:41.600]   that the curse of mankind may be reversed
[00:49:41.600 --> 00:49:43.100]   as the power of the gospel
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:47.900]   takes deep root in our hearts and in our community.
[00:49:47.900 --> 00:49:50.700]   I pray, Father, that in our small groups,
[00:49:50.700 --> 00:49:52.900]   that whether we are weak or whether we are strong,
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:55.300]   whether we are in need of encouragement,
[00:49:55.300 --> 00:49:58.500]   that each one of us, as we look to Christ,
[00:49:58.500 --> 00:50:00.900]   the author and the perfecter of our faith,
[00:50:00.900 --> 00:50:02.300]   would give us the strength, Lord God,
[00:50:02.300 --> 00:50:04.900]   to see the larger world,
[00:50:04.900 --> 00:50:07.700]   the people who are in dire need of you,
[00:50:07.700 --> 00:50:10.100]   who do not yet know you,
[00:50:10.100 --> 00:50:11.600]   that they cannot pray for themselves
[00:50:11.600 --> 00:50:14.700]   because they haven't been reconciled to you.
[00:50:14.700 --> 00:50:17.900]   Help us to be strong for their sake.
[00:50:17.900 --> 00:50:19.300]   So, I pray, especially tonight,
[00:50:19.300 --> 00:50:21.300]   as we have discussions,
[00:50:21.300 --> 00:50:23.500]   that you would bless the time
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:25.300]   and bless the application, Lord,
[00:50:25.300 --> 00:50:26.700]   that they will be able to make.
[00:50:26.700 --> 00:50:28.200]   We thank you in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:50:28.200 --> 00:50:29.200]   Amen.
[00:50:29.200 --> 00:50:39.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
