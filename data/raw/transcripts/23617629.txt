[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   down to them or serve them for I the Lord your God
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:05.160]   am a jealous God, visiting the iniquity of the fathers
[00:00:05.160 --> 00:00:07.360]   and the children to the third and the fourth generation
[00:00:07.360 --> 00:00:09.040]   of those who hate me.
[00:00:09.040 --> 00:00:11.160]   But showing steadfast love to the thousands of those
[00:00:11.160 --> 00:00:13.160]   who love me and keep my commandments.
[00:00:13.160 --> 00:00:15.300]   You should not take the name of the Lord your God in vain
[00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.220]   for the Lord will not hold him guiltless
[00:00:17.220 --> 00:00:18.880]   who takes his name in vain.
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:20.840]   Remember the Sabbath day to keep it holy.
[00:00:20.840 --> 00:00:23.440]   Six days you shall labor and do all your work
[00:00:23.440 --> 00:00:26.200]   but the seventh day is a Sabbath to the Lord your God.
[00:00:26.200 --> 00:00:28.800]   On it you shall not do any work, you or your son
[00:00:28.800 --> 00:00:30.280]   or your daughter or your male servant
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:32.440]   or your female servant or your livestock
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:34.960]   or the sojourners who is within your gates.
[00:00:34.960 --> 00:00:37.160]   For in six days the Lord made heaven and earth and sea
[00:00:37.160 --> 00:00:39.920]   and all that is in them and rested on the seventh day.
[00:00:39.920 --> 00:00:42.820]   Therefore the Lord blessed the Sabbath day and made it holy.
[00:00:42.820 --> 00:00:45.600]   Honor your father and your mother that your days may be long
[00:00:45.600 --> 00:00:48.240]   in the land that the Lord your God is giving you.
[00:00:48.240 --> 00:00:50.440]   You shall not murder, you shall not commit adultery,
[00:00:50.440 --> 00:00:52.800]   you shall not steal, you shall not bear false witness
[00:00:52.800 --> 00:00:54.100]   against your neighbor.
[00:00:54.100 --> 00:00:55.720]   You shall not covet your neighbor's house,
[00:00:55.720 --> 00:00:57.520]   you shall not covet your neighbor's wife
[00:00:57.520 --> 00:00:59.800]   or his male servant or his female servant
[00:00:59.800 --> 00:01:03.360]   or his ox or his donkey or anything that is your neighbor's.
[00:01:03.360 --> 00:01:04.180]   Let's pray.
[00:01:04.180 --> 00:01:10.480]   Gracious Father we wanna thank you
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.400]   for giving us this day where we can honor you
[00:01:15.400 --> 00:01:17.640]   by honoring our mothers.
[00:01:17.640 --> 00:01:21.840]   We thank you Father God that you've given us your grace.
[00:01:21.840 --> 00:01:26.240]   Christ Lord God who forsook his position
[00:01:27.080 --> 00:01:30.840]   and became one of us Lord God and walked this earth.
[00:01:30.840 --> 00:01:32.680]   We thank you Father God that we have mothers
[00:01:32.680 --> 00:01:37.680]   who guide us and teach us to know about who Christ is.
[00:01:37.680 --> 00:01:39.520]   And so we pray for this morning
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:41.360]   that you would strengthen our church
[00:01:41.360 --> 00:01:44.160]   by strengthening the family.
[00:01:44.160 --> 00:01:46.040]   And ultimately Lord God that our mothers
[00:01:46.040 --> 00:01:47.760]   would feel appreciated and strengthened
[00:01:47.760 --> 00:01:49.280]   because of this day.
[00:01:49.280 --> 00:01:50.840]   In Jesus name we pray, amen.
[00:01:50.840 --> 00:01:54.240]   I was talking with Esther this week
[00:01:54.920 --> 00:01:56.840]   and I was talking with Pastor Henry also
[00:01:56.840 --> 00:01:58.320]   that when Mother's Day comes around
[00:01:58.320 --> 00:02:00.400]   I would have to say personally
[00:02:00.400 --> 00:02:02.300]   that one of the hardest sermons to give
[00:02:02.300 --> 00:02:03.440]   is Mother's Day sermon.
[00:02:03.440 --> 00:02:05.040]   So it's always difficult because
[00:02:05.040 --> 00:02:08.280]   every time we get onto this subject
[00:02:08.280 --> 00:02:09.500]   it's like what can I possibly say
[00:02:09.500 --> 00:02:11.560]   that I haven't said already?
[00:02:11.560 --> 00:02:13.340]   And it's hard to look for a text
[00:02:13.340 --> 00:02:14.720]   where it just kind of stands out and say
[00:02:14.720 --> 00:02:17.240]   this is, you should honor your mother.
[00:02:17.240 --> 00:02:19.220]   There are a few texts that we can look at
[00:02:19.220 --> 00:02:22.240]   but again it's a general teaching
[00:02:22.240 --> 00:02:25.920]   about obedience to parents and to honor them.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:27.840]   So every year I kind of wrestle with like
[00:02:27.840 --> 00:02:29.800]   okay what am I gonna say this year?
[00:02:29.800 --> 00:02:31.460]   And so the temptation is to kind of like
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.520]   you know what let's forget this.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:35.280]   I'm just gonna go and plow through the Thessalonians
[00:02:35.280 --> 00:02:37.520]   and talk about the second coming of Christ
[00:02:37.520 --> 00:02:39.760]   and how mothers should look to Christ.
[00:02:39.760 --> 00:02:42.280]   You know, I'm gonna work this in
[00:02:42.280 --> 00:02:43.520]   so I don't have to talk about this.
[00:02:43.520 --> 00:02:47.040]   But again even though there's a temptation to do that
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:48.400]   the reason why I plow through it
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:51.680]   because it is very important for the church.
[00:02:51.680 --> 00:02:53.800]   For the health of the church,
[00:02:53.800 --> 00:02:56.240]   for the ministry of the gospel.
[00:02:56.240 --> 00:02:57.840]   For everything that we're doing in the church
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:00.500]   that we set apart this day to honor our mom.
[00:03:00.500 --> 00:03:03.340]   It's not simply because somebody in American history
[00:03:03.340 --> 00:03:05.920]   decided to do this and we wanna be consistent
[00:03:05.920 --> 00:03:07.920]   with what everybody else is doing.
[00:03:07.920 --> 00:03:09.420]   But what we're doing this morning
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.040]   is consistent with what we see in scripture.
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:14.200]   But I wanna qualify before I start this
[00:03:14.200 --> 00:03:17.240]   because we're not setting apart this day
[00:03:17.240 --> 00:03:19.000]   to honor our mothers.
[00:03:19.000 --> 00:03:21.180]   And I don't know if this was mentioned or not
[00:03:21.180 --> 00:03:22.960]   but if you are a mother just kind of
[00:03:22.960 --> 00:03:23.960]   making sure that you understand.
[00:03:23.960 --> 00:03:26.960]   Afterwards we have a lunch provided for you
[00:03:26.960 --> 00:03:29.900]   even if you are, the baby is not born yet
[00:03:29.900 --> 00:03:31.840]   you're welcome to come and sit with us
[00:03:31.840 --> 00:03:35.520]   and our church family has prepared a nice meal for you.
[00:03:35.520 --> 00:03:40.400]   So please do not go and help us to serve you, okay?
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:41.920]   We're setting aside this day
[00:03:41.920 --> 00:03:44.000]   not simply because it's Mother's Day
[00:03:44.000 --> 00:03:47.080]   and again not simply because the world is doing this
[00:03:47.080 --> 00:03:49.680]   but it's because it's very important
[00:03:49.680 --> 00:03:53.740]   that we establish honor for our mothers and our fathers
[00:03:53.740 --> 00:03:55.660]   but in particular today because it's Mother's Day
[00:03:55.660 --> 00:03:58.940]   our mothers because it has everything to do
[00:03:58.940 --> 00:04:01.660]   with what it means to be a Christian and follower of Christ.
[00:04:01.660 --> 00:04:05.140]   It is directly linked to the message of the cross
[00:04:05.140 --> 00:04:08.160]   and hopefully we can kind of look at this
[00:04:08.160 --> 00:04:09.680]   and get that understanding.
[00:04:09.680 --> 00:04:11.960]   But again I wanted to qualify
[00:04:11.960 --> 00:04:13.380]   that what we're doing this morning
[00:04:13.380 --> 00:04:17.340]   is we're not elevating the mother with Jesus.
[00:04:17.340 --> 00:04:19.620]   You know, it's like well we all these other weeks
[00:04:19.620 --> 00:04:21.840]   we talk about Jesus so we wanna spend one day
[00:04:21.840 --> 00:04:24.180]   and set aside and honor our mothers.
[00:04:24.180 --> 00:04:27.580]   You know, that's not what we're doing this morning.
[00:04:27.580 --> 00:04:29.180]   We're not doing that because you know
[00:04:29.180 --> 00:04:32.580]   we wanna take this day just specifically aside from Christ
[00:04:32.580 --> 00:04:34.660]   remember our mothers.
[00:04:34.660 --> 00:04:37.060]   But remembering and honoring our mothers
[00:04:37.060 --> 00:04:41.500]   is directly linked to honoring our Father in heaven
[00:04:41.500 --> 00:04:44.080]   and the scripture makes that very clear.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:46.040]   So hopefully you understand
[00:04:46.040 --> 00:04:47.120]   that what we're doing this morning
[00:04:47.120 --> 00:04:49.080]   is not simply about motherhood.
[00:04:49.080 --> 00:04:50.820]   It's about worshiping God.
[00:04:50.820 --> 00:04:54.100]   It's about a proper response to what God has done for us.
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:57.020]   I think it's extremely important
[00:04:57.020 --> 00:04:58.220]   especially in our culture,
[00:04:58.220 --> 00:05:02.060]   especially for a church that desires to proclaim Christ
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:04.540]   and be a light in this dark world
[00:05:04.540 --> 00:05:07.520]   because we live in an age where parenting
[00:05:07.520 --> 00:05:09.980]   is not highly valued.
[00:05:09.980 --> 00:05:11.780]   You know, automatically when you have a child
[00:05:11.780 --> 00:05:14.980]   it's a disruption to what we want in life.
[00:05:14.980 --> 00:05:16.380]   And if you look in the media
[00:05:17.700 --> 00:05:20.880]   parents are always portrayed as fools.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:22.200]   You know, especially the dad.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:25.080]   Dad's always the idiot in the family, you know
[00:05:25.080 --> 00:05:26.200]   and mom kind of rescues.
[00:05:26.200 --> 00:05:28.440]   But as a whole in the family structure
[00:05:28.440 --> 00:05:32.700]   the cool, cool person, the wise one is the teenager.
[00:05:32.700 --> 00:05:35.020]   You know, who's rebelling and he doesn't listen to anybody.
[00:05:35.020 --> 00:05:37.000]   He just, you know, makes his own decision,
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:38.400]   does his own thing.
[00:05:38.400 --> 00:05:39.840]   And I noticed that more and more
[00:05:39.840 --> 00:05:43.000]   because now we're raising a teenager
[00:05:43.000 --> 00:05:44.760]   and just this week or last week
[00:05:44.760 --> 00:05:46.700]   we had to take our oldest son, Jeremy
[00:05:46.700 --> 00:05:50.120]   to his high school registration and just the environment.
[00:05:50.120 --> 00:05:52.240]   You know, as soon as we step into the school
[00:05:52.240 --> 00:05:54.680]   he needs to have about five foot distance.
[00:05:54.680 --> 00:05:55.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:05:55.520 --> 00:05:56.880]   'Cause all his friends are around
[00:05:56.880 --> 00:05:59.960]   and we're in his environment now
[00:05:59.960 --> 00:06:02.540]   and parents just don't fit in, you know,
[00:06:02.540 --> 00:06:04.220]   into that environment.
[00:06:04.220 --> 00:06:07.120]   And I understand that there is a tremendous pressure
[00:06:07.120 --> 00:06:09.540]   for teenagers, you know, to be cool.
[00:06:09.540 --> 00:06:10.960]   And I think for teenagers, you know,
[00:06:10.960 --> 00:06:13.840]   to be uncool is like the biggest, you know,
[00:06:13.840 --> 00:06:15.400]   tragedy in life.
[00:06:16.480 --> 00:06:20.640]   But all the more why the church needs to take this time
[00:06:20.640 --> 00:06:23.740]   to establish what God has established
[00:06:23.740 --> 00:06:25.260]   in the community of his believers.
[00:06:25.260 --> 00:06:27.640]   The scripture says, "Honor your father and your mother
[00:06:27.640 --> 00:06:29.880]   "that your days may be long in the land
[00:06:29.880 --> 00:06:31.800]   "which the Lord your God gives you."
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:35.020]   Out of all the commandments for God
[00:06:35.020 --> 00:06:37.160]   to set aside this particular commandment,
[00:06:37.160 --> 00:06:38.940]   say if you wanna live long
[00:06:38.940 --> 00:06:40.300]   and you wanna live prosperously
[00:06:40.300 --> 00:06:42.260]   in the land that you're about to enter,
[00:06:42.260 --> 00:06:45.180]   make sure that you honor your father and mother.
[00:06:45.180 --> 00:06:47.860]   You know, at first glance, it looks kinda strange
[00:06:47.860 --> 00:06:52.100]   because out of all the commandments that God gave, right?
[00:06:52.100 --> 00:06:53.500]   Every commandment that God gives,
[00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:55.980]   there is a practical ramification.
[00:06:55.980 --> 00:06:58.380]   Whether it is dietary loss, you know,
[00:06:58.380 --> 00:07:00.020]   when God first gave those commandments,
[00:07:00.020 --> 00:07:01.900]   people didn't know that certain animals
[00:07:01.900 --> 00:07:02.740]   were not good for them,
[00:07:02.740 --> 00:07:05.360]   certain kind of fish were not good for them.
[00:07:05.360 --> 00:07:07.960]   Way hundreds of years down the line,
[00:07:07.960 --> 00:07:09.940]   as the scientists were examining these animals,
[00:07:09.940 --> 00:07:11.180]   realized that a lot of these things
[00:07:11.180 --> 00:07:13.540]   were physically not good for you.
[00:07:13.540 --> 00:07:16.060]   You know, God's command for us to rest
[00:07:16.060 --> 00:07:18.220]   and how important rest is for human beings,
[00:07:18.220 --> 00:07:21.140]   for our health, whether it is
[00:07:21.140 --> 00:07:22.900]   when you went into the Canaanite land
[00:07:22.900 --> 00:07:25.020]   and not to intermarry with the Canaanites
[00:07:25.020 --> 00:07:27.620]   or the Midianites, because how that was going
[00:07:27.620 --> 00:07:30.640]   to introduce pagan worship.
[00:07:30.640 --> 00:07:32.780]   And so every command that God gave us,
[00:07:32.780 --> 00:07:35.060]   God didn't just kinda pull that out of the air.
[00:07:35.060 --> 00:07:35.980]   He didn't just simply say,
[00:07:35.980 --> 00:07:37.340]   okay, I'm gonna draw this line here,
[00:07:37.340 --> 00:07:39.380]   and just to test your obedience,
[00:07:39.380 --> 00:07:42.220]   just to see if you're gonna do this,
[00:07:42.220 --> 00:07:44.220]   I'm gonna say you should do this
[00:07:44.220 --> 00:07:45.200]   or you shouldn't do this.
[00:07:45.200 --> 00:07:47.780]   Nothing that God tells his people
[00:07:47.780 --> 00:07:49.020]   is just pulled out of the air.
[00:07:49.020 --> 00:07:52.980]   There is practical ramifications if we don't obey it.
[00:07:52.980 --> 00:07:55.940]   So when we look at the commandments,
[00:07:55.940 --> 00:07:57.540]   the commandment that we're looking at
[00:07:57.540 --> 00:07:59.820]   is the fifth commandment out of the 10 commandments.
[00:07:59.820 --> 00:08:02.840]   The first four commandments is about loving God,
[00:08:02.840 --> 00:08:05.800]   to worship him only, to not to use his name in vain,
[00:08:05.800 --> 00:08:08.500]   to not to make carved images of him,
[00:08:08.500 --> 00:08:09.500]   you know, keep the Sabbath holy.
[00:08:09.500 --> 00:08:11.380]   It's all about proper worship to God.
[00:08:11.380 --> 00:08:12.780]   And then the next sixth commandment
[00:08:12.780 --> 00:08:15.580]   is about loving our neighbors.
[00:08:15.580 --> 00:08:17.000]   Now, out of these commandments,
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:18.200]   we would think, you know,
[00:08:18.200 --> 00:08:19.580]   if there's gonna be a promise
[00:08:19.580 --> 00:08:21.420]   that's gonna come with a commandment
[00:08:21.420 --> 00:08:22.860]   that's gonna come with a promise,
[00:08:22.860 --> 00:08:27.060]   you would think it would be do not murder, right?
[00:08:27.060 --> 00:08:28.660]   If you disobey that commandment,
[00:08:28.660 --> 00:08:30.800]   you're not gonna live long, obviously.
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:32.820]   You commit murder, you die, people are gonna die,
[00:08:32.820 --> 00:08:34.140]   you're not gonna live long.
[00:08:34.140 --> 00:08:36.140]   That's practical ramification.
[00:08:36.140 --> 00:08:38.880]   Or if you commit adultery, right?
[00:08:38.880 --> 00:08:41.400]   You're gonna die from that too, right?
[00:08:41.400 --> 00:08:42.980]   Somebody's gonna kill you.
[00:08:42.980 --> 00:08:44.000]   You commit adultery.
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:45.160]   Or how about coveting?
[00:08:45.160 --> 00:08:46.640]   If you covet other people
[00:08:46.640 --> 00:08:49.640]   and it causes discord in the culture
[00:08:49.640 --> 00:08:53.020]   or bearing false witness and out of greed,
[00:08:53.020 --> 00:08:54.600]   you're putting people into prison
[00:08:54.600 --> 00:08:56.440]   and maybe even execution out of, you know,
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.040]   lying for selfishness.
[00:08:58.040 --> 00:08:59.620]   You would think any one of those commandments,
[00:08:59.620 --> 00:09:04.120]   we say we can see the obvious ramifications
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.360]   of not obeying those commandments in the culture.
[00:09:06.360 --> 00:09:09.600]   So if you disobey any of that in the new land,
[00:09:09.600 --> 00:09:10.720]   you're not gonna live long.
[00:09:10.720 --> 00:09:13.520]   There's not gonna be prosperity to you.
[00:09:13.520 --> 00:09:16.040]   But the commandment that he chose to set aside
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:19.840]   was the first one, honor your father and your mother,
[00:09:19.840 --> 00:09:22.920]   that you may live long in the land.
[00:09:22.920 --> 00:09:26.480]   What practical ramifications does it have
[00:09:26.480 --> 00:09:29.760]   that that would be said above do not murder,
[00:09:29.760 --> 00:09:33.200]   do not commit adultery, do not bear false witness?
[00:09:33.200 --> 00:09:35.200]   What is it about that?
[00:09:36.040 --> 00:09:41.040]   Well, you look at it in Paul's writings
[00:09:41.040 --> 00:09:44.080]   in 1 Timothy 5.8, Paul tells the church,
[00:09:44.080 --> 00:09:46.880]   he says if an individual does not take care
[00:09:46.880 --> 00:09:50.880]   of his widowed mother, he is worse than an unbeliever.
[00:09:50.880 --> 00:09:53.320]   He said that a believer, one of the first things
[00:09:53.320 --> 00:09:55.160]   that we need to be responsible for
[00:09:55.160 --> 00:09:57.140]   in loving God and worshiping God
[00:09:57.140 --> 00:09:59.800]   is to take care of our widowed mothers
[00:09:59.800 --> 00:10:01.400]   when they are in need.
[00:10:01.400 --> 00:10:04.600]   Jesus rebukes the Pharisees in Matthew 15, 3 to 6.
[00:10:04.600 --> 00:10:07.240]   And he says, why do you break the commandments of God
[00:10:07.240 --> 00:10:08.480]   for the sake of your tradition?
[00:10:08.480 --> 00:10:11.360]   For God commanded, honor your father and your mother,
[00:10:11.360 --> 00:10:15.140]   and whoever reviles father or mother must surely die.
[00:10:15.140 --> 00:10:17.900]   But you say, if anyone tells his father or his mother
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:21.400]   what you would have gained from me is given to God,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:22.920]   he need not honor his father.
[00:10:22.920 --> 00:10:24.080]   For the sake of your tradition,
[00:10:24.080 --> 00:10:25.640]   you have made void the word of God.
[00:10:25.640 --> 00:10:28.840]   And God, Jesus keeps on bringing this up to the Pharisees,
[00:10:28.840 --> 00:10:31.280]   saying that for the sake of your tradition,
[00:10:31.280 --> 00:10:33.860]   you are breaking this commandment.
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:37.060]   So not only is this commandment true in the Old Testament,
[00:10:37.060 --> 00:10:38.540]   but even in the New Testament.
[00:10:38.540 --> 00:10:40.940]   It wasn't just given to the Israelites.
[00:10:40.940 --> 00:10:42.660]   We see it of the new covenant people.
[00:10:42.660 --> 00:10:45.320]   In fact, that same phrase, that same commandment
[00:10:45.320 --> 00:10:48.580]   is repeated again in Ephesians chapter six.
[00:10:48.580 --> 00:10:52.240]   So why this commandment is set aside
[00:10:52.240 --> 00:10:54.560]   above other commandments, say if you want to live long.
[00:10:54.560 --> 00:10:57.640]   Well, the practical ramification of obedience
[00:10:57.640 --> 00:11:00.860]   and honoring our parents is directly linked
[00:11:00.860 --> 00:11:05.520]   to how God has designed our family structure
[00:11:05.520 --> 00:11:06.720]   to be built up.
[00:11:06.720 --> 00:11:11.120]   So if we are truly committed to building,
[00:11:11.120 --> 00:11:13.260]   not just an individual worships God,
[00:11:13.260 --> 00:11:15.560]   but a community of people that worships God,
[00:11:15.560 --> 00:11:18.840]   we need to first be able to honor and obey
[00:11:18.840 --> 00:11:20.440]   how God has designed it.
[00:11:20.440 --> 00:11:21.800]   You know, we talked about, you know,
[00:11:21.800 --> 00:11:23.840]   if you want to build a healthy marriage,
[00:11:23.840 --> 00:11:25.120]   anytime there's marriage counseling,
[00:11:25.120 --> 00:11:27.120]   we always talk about the role of the father
[00:11:27.120 --> 00:11:29.280]   and the role of the wife,
[00:11:29.280 --> 00:11:31.140]   and how these are building blocks
[00:11:31.140 --> 00:11:33.220]   of a healthy Christian marriage,
[00:11:33.220 --> 00:11:37.420]   and how Jesus and the church is the reflection,
[00:11:37.420 --> 00:11:39.420]   and that's the model that we are to follow,
[00:11:39.420 --> 00:11:41.420]   how Jesus loved the church unconditionally
[00:11:41.420 --> 00:11:42.900]   and gave himself for the church,
[00:11:42.900 --> 00:11:46.140]   and how the church should submit to Christ, right?
[00:11:46.140 --> 00:11:48.540]   And how the wives should follow that as a model
[00:11:48.540 --> 00:11:50.380]   to submit to their husband.
[00:11:50.380 --> 00:11:52.500]   Well, that's in the family structure,
[00:11:52.500 --> 00:11:55.160]   but as the structure that goes beyond that
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.980]   is the relationship between the parents and their children.
[00:11:57.980 --> 00:12:01.520]   If the family structure is to be honored by God,
[00:12:01.520 --> 00:12:04.240]   if it is to reflect the gospel,
[00:12:04.240 --> 00:12:07.400]   it needs to follow what Christ teaches us in the scriptures.
[00:12:07.400 --> 00:12:10.700]   He said, "To honor our father and mother
[00:12:10.700 --> 00:12:13.700]   "has practical ramification in building the kingdom of God,"
[00:12:13.700 --> 00:12:15.100]   building a healthy church.
[00:12:15.100 --> 00:12:19.280]   When parents begin to devalue children
[00:12:19.280 --> 00:12:21.880]   and children begin to rebel against their parents,
[00:12:21.880 --> 00:12:25.560]   the very fabric of what God intended in the church
[00:12:25.560 --> 00:12:27.320]   begins to break down.
[00:12:27.320 --> 00:12:30.560]   If you see the Old Testament law,
[00:12:30.560 --> 00:12:32.780]   this is something that is very, very difficult
[00:12:32.780 --> 00:12:37.040]   for modern thinkers to accept in our way of thinking,
[00:12:37.040 --> 00:12:38.560]   because in the Old Testament law,
[00:12:38.560 --> 00:12:41.360]   one of the law that may sound strange
[00:12:41.360 --> 00:12:43.920]   and probably many people would be repulsed by
[00:12:43.920 --> 00:12:46.360]   is if a teenage son, if a son rebels
[00:12:46.360 --> 00:12:48.140]   and curses his father and mother,
[00:12:48.140 --> 00:12:52.800]   the penalty for that was capital punishment.
[00:12:52.800 --> 00:12:56.480]   They were to take the child out and stone them publicly.
[00:12:56.480 --> 00:12:57.640]   Now, you look at that and say,
[00:12:57.640 --> 00:13:02.640]   "How can you possibly think that that is okay?"
[00:13:02.640 --> 00:13:05.120]   Especially in our culture where we are taught
[00:13:05.120 --> 00:13:07.400]   even spanking is wrong, right?
[00:13:07.400 --> 00:13:08.560]   You can't spank your kids.
[00:13:08.560 --> 00:13:10.320]   It's gonna make them violent children.
[00:13:10.320 --> 00:13:12.880]   That's not grace, that's not love.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:15.160]   Yet in the Old Testament, it was capital punishment.
[00:13:15.160 --> 00:13:16.960]   So on the surface, when we look at that,
[00:13:16.960 --> 00:13:18.260]   we say, "That's difficult to understand.
[00:13:18.260 --> 00:13:21.500]   "That must be one of those ancient barbaric things
[00:13:21.500 --> 00:13:24.320]   "that they did, but now that we know a gracious God,
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:25.640]   "He has changed."
[00:13:25.640 --> 00:13:29.240]   I think the reason why God gave such a harsh punishment
[00:13:29.240 --> 00:13:32.800]   for that is because those are the beginning signs
[00:13:32.800 --> 00:13:36.260]   of the unraveling of the people of God.
[00:13:36.260 --> 00:13:39.740]   When we do not honor our fathers and mothers,
[00:13:39.740 --> 00:13:43.200]   that is the beginning signs that creeps in
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:46.460]   and eventually the rebellion against father and mother
[00:13:46.460 --> 00:13:48.220]   is only a reflection of the rebellion
[00:13:48.220 --> 00:13:49.640]   against what is above them.
[00:13:49.640 --> 00:13:52.760]   Typically, when we rebel and do not honor our father
[00:13:52.760 --> 00:13:54.720]   and our mother, that's a reflection against
[00:13:54.720 --> 00:13:56.880]   all the authority that is above us.
[00:13:56.880 --> 00:14:04.080]   Our culture values independence and it values rebellion.
[00:14:04.080 --> 00:14:07.120]   Like I said, in order to be cool,
[00:14:07.120 --> 00:14:08.900]   look at the songs that they sing.
[00:14:08.900 --> 00:14:11.960]   I don't know the modern songs today
[00:14:11.960 --> 00:14:13.680]   because I don't know what the kids listen to,
[00:14:13.680 --> 00:14:16.560]   but I remember when I was younger in high school,
[00:14:16.560 --> 00:14:19.720]   there was a song called "We Don't Need No Education."
[00:14:19.720 --> 00:14:22.320]   We don't need no teachers and their dirty rules.
[00:14:22.320 --> 00:14:25.040]   We used to sing that and say, "Yeah, we don't need that."
[00:14:25.040 --> 00:14:25.880]   You know what I mean?
[00:14:25.880 --> 00:14:26.720]   I don't know what they sing today,
[00:14:26.720 --> 00:14:30.400]   but I'm pretty sure it's gotten much worse than that.
[00:14:30.400 --> 00:14:31.720]   Teenagers, this is what they value.
[00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:34.120]   This is what our culture teaches.
[00:14:34.120 --> 00:14:36.040]   So if the church doesn't stand up
[00:14:36.040 --> 00:14:39.600]   and stand up with what the scripture says
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:42.400]   and stand up and say, "This is what God,
[00:14:42.400 --> 00:14:45.400]   "this is the practical way for us to honor God,"
[00:14:45.400 --> 00:14:47.580]   then it'll be impossible for us to build a church
[00:14:47.580 --> 00:14:51.320]   that ultimately values true worship of God.
[00:14:51.320 --> 00:14:55.160]   Some of you guys may have read or heard of this poem.
[00:14:55.160 --> 00:14:59.160]   This man wrote about everything I learned,
[00:14:59.160 --> 00:15:00.400]   I learned in kindergarten.
[00:15:00.400 --> 00:15:02.500]   Any of you read that or heard that before?
[00:15:02.500 --> 00:15:06.800]   I've read it in service, so you must have heard it.
[00:15:06.800 --> 00:15:10.840]   Let me read a portion of it for you where it says,
[00:15:10.840 --> 00:15:13.520]   "Everything I learned, I learned in kindergarten.
[00:15:13.520 --> 00:15:17.680]   "Share everything, play fair, don't hit people.
[00:15:17.680 --> 00:15:19.460]   "Put things back where you found them.
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:21.160]   "Clean up your own mess.
[00:15:21.160 --> 00:15:23.040]   "Don't take things that aren't yours.
[00:15:23.040 --> 00:15:26.580]   "Say you're sorry when you hurt somebody.
[00:15:26.580 --> 00:15:28.520]   "Wash your hands before you eat.
[00:15:28.520 --> 00:15:29.840]   "Flush.
[00:15:29.840 --> 00:15:32.900]   "Warm cookies and cold milk are good for you.
[00:15:32.900 --> 00:15:34.160]   "Live a balanced life.
[00:15:34.160 --> 00:15:36.560]   "Learn some and think some and draw and paint
[00:15:36.560 --> 00:15:39.340]   "and sing and dance and play and work every day some.
[00:15:39.340 --> 00:15:41.540]   "Take a nap every afternoon.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:43.640]   "When you go out into the world, watch out for traffic.
[00:15:43.640 --> 00:15:45.120]   "Hold hands and stick together."
[00:15:45.120 --> 00:15:45.960]   And he goes on.
[00:15:45.960 --> 00:15:49.080]   You look at that and say, "Oh, what a cute story.
[00:15:49.080 --> 00:15:51.760]   "Everything that we learned, how to be a good citizen,
[00:15:51.760 --> 00:15:54.200]   "how to be a good person, we learn in kindergarten."
[00:15:54.200 --> 00:15:56.040]   I say, "Absolutely bogus."
[00:15:56.040 --> 00:15:58.860]   If you are a mother sitting in this room,
[00:15:58.860 --> 00:16:00.660]   you should be offended by this poem.
[00:16:00.660 --> 00:16:04.520]   Kindergarten didn't teach you to flush the toilet.
[00:16:04.520 --> 00:16:06.280]   You mean until you were five years old,
[00:16:06.280 --> 00:16:08.760]   you didn't know how to flush the toilet?
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:10.720]   Your mother taught you that.
[00:16:10.720 --> 00:16:12.480]   Hold hands when you walk across the street.
[00:16:12.480 --> 00:16:13.660]   You think until five years old,
[00:16:13.660 --> 00:16:15.780]   you just ran straight into traffic
[00:16:15.780 --> 00:16:18.200]   because you weren't in kindergarten yet?
[00:16:18.200 --> 00:16:19.040]   That's ridiculous.
[00:16:19.040 --> 00:16:22.320]   You didn't learn this from kindergarten.
[00:16:22.320 --> 00:16:25.720]   You went to kindergarten for what, four hours each day
[00:16:25.720 --> 00:16:27.680]   and all of this stuff, all of a sudden,
[00:16:27.680 --> 00:16:32.200]   you couldn't do any of this stuff, right?
[00:16:32.200 --> 00:16:35.080]   No, all of this, all the fundamental things
[00:16:35.080 --> 00:16:39.820]   that make you a human being was taught by your mother
[00:16:39.820 --> 00:16:42.280]   with the help of the father, right?
[00:16:42.280 --> 00:16:45.720]   So we need to give credit where credit is due.
[00:16:45.720 --> 00:16:46.620]   Our mothers did that.
[00:16:46.620 --> 00:16:48.260]   Our mothers labored.
[00:16:48.260 --> 00:16:51.080]   The theologians say that Christians,
[00:16:51.080 --> 00:16:54.540]   we have special grace because we have been given
[00:16:54.540 --> 00:16:56.600]   the knowledge of Jesus Christ
[00:16:56.600 --> 00:16:59.440]   through the special revelation of the word of God.
[00:16:59.440 --> 00:17:00.500]   But all human beings,
[00:17:00.500 --> 00:17:02.040]   whether you are Christian or non-Christian,
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:04.920]   is under common grace until the judgment day.
[00:17:04.920 --> 00:17:06.800]   And common grace basically means
[00:17:06.800 --> 00:17:09.440]   that because God is withholding his judgment,
[00:17:09.440 --> 00:17:12.720]   that there are still reflections of his goodness,
[00:17:12.720 --> 00:17:15.600]   of his righteousness, that everybody enjoys
[00:17:15.600 --> 00:17:16.820]   until the day of judgment.
[00:17:16.820 --> 00:17:20.360]   And one of the greatest of the common grace
[00:17:20.360 --> 00:17:23.120]   is that every Christian, every non-Christian
[00:17:23.120 --> 00:17:26.000]   has a mother watching out for them.
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:29.020]   And that's by the grace of God.
[00:17:29.020 --> 00:17:32.900]   We would not be here without somebody laboring in our lives.
[00:17:32.900 --> 00:17:33.760]   We would not be here.
[00:17:33.760 --> 00:17:35.920]   We would not be able to eat.
[00:17:35.920 --> 00:17:37.280]   We would know how to put socks on.
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.400]   We would know when to flush the toilet.
[00:17:39.400 --> 00:17:41.340]   You would still be wearing diapers.
[00:17:41.340 --> 00:17:42.960]   Somebody taught you that, right?
[00:17:42.960 --> 00:17:45.080]   And it was not kindergarten.
[00:17:45.080 --> 00:17:46.640]   You learned that way before you turned five.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:48.620]   I hope you did, right?
[00:17:48.620 --> 00:17:54.080]   We need to give thanks where thanks is due.
[00:17:54.080 --> 00:17:56.640]   That's what, isn't that what it says in Romans 1?
[00:17:56.640 --> 00:17:59.560]   It says judgment is coming because they gave thanks
[00:17:59.560 --> 00:18:02.280]   to the creation rather than the creator.
[00:18:02.280 --> 00:18:06.000]   So again, I wanna emphasize that our thanking
[00:18:06.000 --> 00:18:09.520]   of our mothers ultimately is not about the mom, really,
[00:18:09.520 --> 00:18:14.060]   because even the moms are stewards.
[00:18:14.060 --> 00:18:15.320]   But we don't bypass the stewards.
[00:18:15.320 --> 00:18:16.440]   We need to thank them.
[00:18:16.440 --> 00:18:17.280]   We need to honor them.
[00:18:17.280 --> 00:18:19.760]   But ultimately, if our thanksgiving stops there,
[00:18:19.760 --> 00:18:22.120]   we're no different than Romans 1,
[00:18:22.120 --> 00:18:25.080]   giving thanks to the stewards rather than the person
[00:18:25.080 --> 00:18:27.680]   who put the steward there in our lives.
[00:18:27.680 --> 00:18:29.300]   Nonetheless, we need to be thankful.
[00:18:29.300 --> 00:18:30.600]   We need to honor them.
[00:18:30.600 --> 00:18:31.440]   It is our duty.
[00:18:31.440 --> 00:18:32.940]   It is our responsibility.
[00:18:32.940 --> 00:18:37.540]   Ultimately, it is a reflection of genuine worship to God.
[00:18:37.540 --> 00:18:41.040]   By honoring our mothers, we are taught from early on
[00:18:41.040 --> 00:18:43.560]   to respect those who are elderly.
[00:18:43.560 --> 00:18:47.900]   And it is a huge part of what it means to be mature,
[00:18:47.900 --> 00:18:52.180]   not only to respect those that you can gain something from,
[00:18:52.180 --> 00:18:54.620]   but respecting those who labor in your life,
[00:18:54.620 --> 00:18:56.260]   respecting authority.
[00:18:56.260 --> 00:19:00.920]   These are huge, huge things that we need to learn.
[00:19:00.920 --> 00:19:03.420]   When you get a job, of course, you have a resume.
[00:19:03.420 --> 00:19:04.860]   But one of the things that they ask you
[00:19:04.860 --> 00:19:06.460]   when you go to an interview is,
[00:19:06.460 --> 00:19:08.780]   can you work with authority, right?
[00:19:08.780 --> 00:19:10.660]   One of the things, are you a good team player?
[00:19:10.660 --> 00:19:12.520]   Can you work with your peers?
[00:19:12.520 --> 00:19:14.300]   But another important question that they ask you is,
[00:19:14.300 --> 00:19:16.100]   do you have problem with authority?
[00:19:16.100 --> 00:19:19.400]   Meaning that, can you take orders?
[00:19:19.400 --> 00:19:20.700]   Can you work under a manager?
[00:19:20.700 --> 00:19:23.940]   And said, no, you know, it's like, I do whatever I want.
[00:19:23.940 --> 00:19:26.980]   Right, you're not gonna get hired.
[00:19:26.980 --> 00:19:30.140]   See, practical ramification of honoring our father and mother
[00:19:30.140 --> 00:19:34.840]   is that God has given us, whether it is the government,
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:36.420]   which God tells us to submit to,
[00:19:36.420 --> 00:19:39.340]   because God's the one who establishes all authority,
[00:19:39.340 --> 00:19:41.980]   and the most practical authority in our lives
[00:19:41.980 --> 00:19:43.740]   is our mother and father.
[00:19:43.740 --> 00:19:47.140]   And this morning, we are dealing with our mothers.
[00:19:47.140 --> 00:19:49.420]   In Ephesians chapter six, verse one,
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.940]   when we are called, said, "Children, obey your parents."
[00:19:53.940 --> 00:19:57.200]   That word children there is not referring to little kids
[00:19:57.200 --> 00:19:58.660]   that we saw in the video.
[00:19:58.660 --> 00:20:00.060]   There are two different words for children.
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:03.420]   One is paidio, which is talking about young little children,
[00:20:03.420 --> 00:20:05.620]   and the other word is technon,
[00:20:05.620 --> 00:20:07.340]   and the technon is referring to anybody
[00:20:07.340 --> 00:20:09.060]   who has a mother and father.
[00:20:09.060 --> 00:20:10.860]   So that passage in Ephesians 6, one
[00:20:10.860 --> 00:20:13.140]   is not referring to just little kids.
[00:20:13.140 --> 00:20:15.100]   He's talking to the grown-up church.
[00:20:15.100 --> 00:20:18.780]   He uses the word technon, and he tells the technon
[00:20:18.780 --> 00:20:22.280]   to obey your mother and father, your parents.
[00:20:22.280 --> 00:20:26.020]   Some people think that because now that I'm married,
[00:20:26.020 --> 00:20:29.740]   and the scripture tells us to leave and to cleave,
[00:20:29.740 --> 00:20:32.380]   to leave means that we're no longer obligated
[00:20:32.380 --> 00:20:33.320]   to obey our parents.
[00:20:33.320 --> 00:20:34.820]   That is not true.
[00:20:34.820 --> 00:20:36.860]   That passage in Ephesians chapter six
[00:20:36.860 --> 00:20:40.700]   clearly says to adult children that our responsibility
[00:20:40.700 --> 00:20:43.260]   to honor our father and mother remains,
[00:20:43.260 --> 00:20:45.180]   whether you are married or not married.
[00:20:45.180 --> 00:20:47.300]   It's just a matter of priority,
[00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:49.140]   that this is now your first family,
[00:20:49.140 --> 00:20:52.340]   but our responsibility to care for our parents
[00:20:52.340 --> 00:20:55.100]   and to honor them never leaves us,
[00:20:55.100 --> 00:20:58.260]   just as the responsibility for parents
[00:20:58.260 --> 00:20:59.860]   will never leave them.
[00:20:59.860 --> 00:21:04.260]   Then those of you guys who are in your 20s,
[00:21:05.140 --> 00:21:07.540]   that's the period when a lot of people
[00:21:07.540 --> 00:21:09.140]   have a hard time with their parents
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.340]   because you see yourself as an adult,
[00:21:11.340 --> 00:21:14.460]   but the parents have a hard time seeing you as an adult,
[00:21:14.460 --> 00:21:16.980]   so there's a lot of tension during your 20s.
[00:21:16.980 --> 00:21:19.520]   A lot of times you think that that rebellion
[00:21:19.520 --> 00:21:23.180]   ends with teenage year, but what I've noticed
[00:21:23.180 --> 00:21:26.380]   is that in your 20s is where the transition takes place,
[00:21:26.380 --> 00:21:30.140]   where you're not a child, but it's hard for parents
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:31.620]   to just kind of let go.
[00:21:31.620 --> 00:21:35.100]   And I can honestly say, now from a parent's point
[00:21:35.100 --> 00:21:40.100]   of view, that I wiped this kid's butt.
[00:21:40.100 --> 00:21:41.300]   You know what I mean?
[00:21:41.300 --> 00:21:44.500]   This guy, I raised this kid since he couldn't do anything,
[00:21:44.500 --> 00:21:47.300]   and all of a sudden now he wants to make his own decision
[00:21:47.300 --> 00:21:48.140]   and do everything.
[00:21:48.140 --> 00:21:50.100]   That's very unsettling to me.
[00:21:50.100 --> 00:21:51.540]   And so I can imagine from parents,
[00:21:51.540 --> 00:21:54.220]   I don't have kids who are in their 20s yet,
[00:21:54.220 --> 00:21:57.340]   but I can imagine parents having a hard time
[00:21:57.340 --> 00:21:58.180]   just letting go like that.
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:22:00.660]   And one of these days when you're parents at that point,
[00:22:00.660 --> 00:22:02.620]   you're probably gonna understand much better
[00:22:02.620 --> 00:22:04.380]   some of the conflicts that you may be going through
[00:22:04.380 --> 00:22:06.620]   right now because you are in your 20s.
[00:22:06.620 --> 00:22:09.900]   It's absolutely essential and important for us
[00:22:09.900 --> 00:22:11.540]   that we are to honor our mothers.
[00:22:11.540 --> 00:22:14.980]   When I think about honoring mothers,
[00:22:14.980 --> 00:22:17.980]   their very first person example that I think of
[00:22:17.980 --> 00:22:22.340]   in the New Testament is Mary, the mother of Jesus.
[00:22:22.340 --> 00:22:26.500]   Now, the Protestant church is very hesitant
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:28.500]   to talk about Mary because whenever the subject
[00:22:28.500 --> 00:22:32.340]   of Mary comes up, it's usually about how we ought
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:36.020]   to not worship her because of the Catholic church.
[00:22:36.020 --> 00:22:38.660]   The Catholic church venerates her to the point
[00:22:38.660 --> 00:22:41.140]   where they call her co-redemptress,
[00:22:41.140 --> 00:22:44.300]   that Jesus is the only mediator between us and God,
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.380]   but we have a mediator between us and Jesus,
[00:22:47.380 --> 00:22:48.420]   the mother Mary.
[00:22:48.420 --> 00:22:50.980]   And so because of that, that wrong doctrine,
[00:22:50.980 --> 00:22:53.020]   that heresy, that Protestant church,
[00:22:53.020 --> 00:22:55.020]   whenever we mention Mary, we have a tendency
[00:22:55.020 --> 00:22:57.160]   to kind of say what you should not do.
[00:22:57.160 --> 00:23:00.460]   But I wanna see Mary as a human being
[00:23:00.460 --> 00:23:04.660]   and to sympathize with her and see what God has done
[00:23:04.660 --> 00:23:06.420]   and through her.
[00:23:06.420 --> 00:23:09.020]   She shows up in Luke chapter one and the angel says,
[00:23:09.020 --> 00:23:12.260]   "You are graced, you are highly favored."
[00:23:12.260 --> 00:23:13.380]   And that word literally means
[00:23:13.380 --> 00:23:15.060]   that you've been graced by God.
[00:23:15.060 --> 00:23:19.820]   Mary knew from early on that she was not carrying
[00:23:19.820 --> 00:23:22.780]   an ordinary child, obviously, she was immaculate conception
[00:23:22.780 --> 00:23:24.460]   so that does not happen.
[00:23:24.460 --> 00:23:28.740]   If you have a child and you didn't have the intercourse
[00:23:28.740 --> 00:23:31.140]   or whatever that normally comes by that way,
[00:23:31.140 --> 00:23:32.300]   you know something is special.
[00:23:32.300 --> 00:23:34.600]   But not only the way that she got pregnant,
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:38.020]   but the angels came, made it very clear.
[00:23:38.020 --> 00:23:42.100]   Then Luke chapter two, she meets certain prophets
[00:23:42.100 --> 00:23:44.660]   that prophesize for her that your child
[00:23:44.660 --> 00:23:46.340]   is gonna come into this world
[00:23:46.340 --> 00:23:47.660]   and he's gonna be the Messiah,
[00:23:47.660 --> 00:23:50.320]   who's gonna deliver the nation of Israel.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.260]   So Mary knew from the very beginning
[00:23:52.260 --> 00:23:55.020]   that she didn't have an ordinary child.
[00:23:56.240 --> 00:23:59.180]   Can you imagine raising a perfect kid?
[00:23:59.180 --> 00:24:02.880]   The parents always talk about how our kids,
[00:24:02.880 --> 00:24:04.920]   he's so rambunctious, doesn't listen
[00:24:04.920 --> 00:24:07.420]   and how difficult it is because so strong willed.
[00:24:07.420 --> 00:24:09.600]   But I would rather raise a difficult child
[00:24:09.600 --> 00:24:10.780]   than a perfect kid.
[00:24:10.780 --> 00:24:13.240]   And that's what Mary had to do.
[00:24:13.240 --> 00:24:18.240]   Mary raised a perfect child 'cause he's the son of God.
[00:24:18.240 --> 00:24:21.440]   In Luke chapter two, 48 through 49,
[00:24:21.440 --> 00:24:24.600]   we see a scene where he's 12 years old
[00:24:24.600 --> 00:24:27.600]   and Joseph and Mary are taking him to the temple
[00:24:27.600 --> 00:24:30.800]   to dedicate and to worship.
[00:24:30.800 --> 00:24:34.280]   And in the hustle and bustle, they lost him.
[00:24:34.280 --> 00:24:36.560]   And they said they lost him for three days.
[00:24:36.560 --> 00:24:38.720]   Now, any of you who are a parent
[00:24:38.720 --> 00:24:40.080]   know exactly what that feels like
[00:24:40.080 --> 00:24:41.960]   if you've ever lost your child.
[00:24:41.960 --> 00:24:45.840]   I think Esther and I lost our kid maybe once or twice
[00:24:45.840 --> 00:24:47.700]   and both times was Zachary.
[00:24:47.700 --> 00:24:51.040]   He was just, our second kid,
[00:24:51.040 --> 00:24:53.000]   I mean he just was full of energy.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:55.320]   And I remember we were, this one particular time,
[00:24:55.320 --> 00:24:58.040]   we went to the INS office and my mom was watching him.
[00:24:58.040 --> 00:25:00.120]   Just for a second, he turned around.
[00:25:00.120 --> 00:25:01.800]   He was probably no more than about two, two and a half,
[00:25:01.800 --> 00:25:03.280]   about Isaiah's age now.
[00:25:03.280 --> 00:25:06.560]   He ran into the elevator, we weren't paying attention
[00:25:06.560 --> 00:25:08.320]   and he just disappeared on us.
[00:25:08.320 --> 00:25:10.840]   We turned around, my mom didn't know where he was,
[00:25:10.840 --> 00:25:11.920]   Esther didn't know where he was
[00:25:11.920 --> 00:25:13.280]   and I didn't know where he was.
[00:25:13.280 --> 00:25:14.480]   So that was probably about a good,
[00:25:14.480 --> 00:25:16.040]   maybe about six or seven minutes.
[00:25:16.040 --> 00:25:17.360]   We were frantic.
[00:25:17.360 --> 00:25:19.320]   And you have to remember, this is not an empty building.
[00:25:19.320 --> 00:25:22.480]   This is a building full of people that we don't know.
[00:25:22.480 --> 00:25:24.560]   So we're thinking, oh my gosh, what happened?
[00:25:24.560 --> 00:25:26.520]   And then in the middle of all of this,
[00:25:26.520 --> 00:25:28.080]   we see the elevator door opening
[00:25:28.080 --> 00:25:32.560]   and the security guard basically found him at the basement
[00:25:32.560 --> 00:25:34.680]   'cause he ran out and he was running all over
[00:25:34.680 --> 00:25:36.440]   and said, this kid doesn't belong here.
[00:25:36.440 --> 00:25:38.760]   So he said, this must be from that floor.
[00:25:38.760 --> 00:25:40.320]   So he brought him up.
[00:25:40.320 --> 00:25:42.440]   So I can imagine, and again, any parent
[00:25:42.440 --> 00:25:45.120]   who's lost their child, even for five minutes,
[00:25:45.120 --> 00:25:46.200]   they know what that feels like.
[00:25:46.200 --> 00:25:50.560]   Well, the scripture says they lost him for three days.
[00:25:50.560 --> 00:25:52.600]   They couldn't find him for three days.
[00:25:52.600 --> 00:25:54.800]   And then they finally go back to the temple
[00:25:54.800 --> 00:25:57.240]   and this is the response in verse 48.
[00:25:57.240 --> 00:26:00.840]   And when his parents saw him, they were astonished.
[00:26:00.840 --> 00:26:04.560]   And his mother said to him, son, why have you treated us so?
[00:26:04.560 --> 00:26:06.040]   And again, any parent would say that.
[00:26:06.040 --> 00:26:07.580]   I think that's an understatement.
[00:26:07.580 --> 00:26:10.040]   Son, why have you treated us so?
[00:26:10.040 --> 00:26:14.200]   Maybe that's the cleaner version.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.040]   'Cause I would have said, what is wrong with you?
[00:26:17.040 --> 00:26:18.760]   Three days.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:21.080]   You told your father and I have been searching for you
[00:26:21.080 --> 00:26:23.500]   in great distress.
[00:26:23.500 --> 00:26:25.200]   And you would expect the child to be like,
[00:26:25.200 --> 00:26:27.400]   oh, I'm sorry, I was playing with my friends,
[00:26:27.400 --> 00:26:29.320]   I lost track of time.
[00:26:29.320 --> 00:26:31.520]   But Jesus turned around and he said to them,
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:33.160]   why were you looking for me?
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:36.060]   Because you were gone for three days.
[00:26:36.060 --> 00:26:41.040]   Did you not know that I must be in my father's house?
[00:26:41.040 --> 00:26:44.600]   And only Jesus, don't ever say that.
[00:26:44.600 --> 00:26:47.160]   You would never train a child to turn around and say,
[00:26:47.160 --> 00:26:48.720]   why were you looking for me?
[00:26:48.720 --> 00:26:53.560]   Did you not know that I needed to be with my friends?
[00:26:53.560 --> 00:26:58.160]   Only Jesus can say this, right?
[00:26:58.160 --> 00:27:01.800]   Did you not know that I need to be in my father's house?
[00:27:01.800 --> 00:27:05.500]   And what the response is interesting after that
[00:27:05.500 --> 00:27:09.220]   is that it says Joseph and Mary did not, at that time,
[00:27:09.220 --> 00:27:12.160]   understand what Jesus was saying.
[00:27:12.160 --> 00:27:13.880]   So we don't know what happened after that
[00:27:13.880 --> 00:27:15.040]   'cause it doesn't say.
[00:27:15.040 --> 00:27:16.720]   'Cause Joseph and Mary did not understand
[00:27:16.720 --> 00:27:17.540]   what he was saying.
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:20.940]   Now, remember that this was clearly prophesied
[00:27:20.940 --> 00:27:23.960]   to Joseph and to Mary who Jesus was.
[00:27:23.960 --> 00:27:26.560]   And so Jesus is only repeating what they should have known.
[00:27:26.560 --> 00:27:28.360]   He said, did you not know?
[00:27:28.360 --> 00:27:30.560]   This is who I am, that I needed to be at my father's house,
[00:27:30.560 --> 00:27:31.920]   but they didn't understand.
[00:27:31.920 --> 00:27:35.140]   But you know what that teaches me
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.020]   is that Jesus and Mary raised Jesus like any other child.
[00:27:39.020 --> 00:27:42.840]   Even though he was the prophesied Messiah,
[00:27:42.840 --> 00:27:44.500]   they weren't thinking like, the Messiah,
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:45.600]   he's gonna be at the temple.
[00:27:45.600 --> 00:27:48.020]   They were looking for their 12-year-old kid
[00:27:48.020 --> 00:27:49.200]   that disappeared.
[00:27:49.200 --> 00:27:50.960]   And then when he says this, they say,
[00:27:50.960 --> 00:27:52.560]   hmm, what are you talking about?
[00:27:52.560 --> 00:27:55.680]   In John chapter two, three to five,
[00:27:55.680 --> 00:27:57.780]   we see another intimate scene with Jesus
[00:27:57.780 --> 00:27:59.840]   and his mother Mary.
[00:27:59.840 --> 00:28:02.800]   Where they're at the wedding and the wine disappeared.
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:05.480]   And this is a huge disgrace to them
[00:28:05.480 --> 00:28:08.560]   who were throwing this party 'cause they ran out of wine.
[00:28:08.560 --> 00:28:12.720]   So Mary calls Jesus and says, hey, Jesus,
[00:28:12.720 --> 00:28:13.760]   we're out of wine.
[00:28:13.760 --> 00:28:15.980]   Can you do something about this?
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.500]   And Jesus' response in verse four, chapter two,
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:22.780]   says, woman, what does this have to do with me?
[00:28:22.780 --> 00:28:25.340]   My hour has not yet come.
[00:28:25.340 --> 00:28:27.240]   We know what Jesus is talking about.
[00:28:27.240 --> 00:28:30.220]   Jesus' mission was very clear.
[00:28:30.220 --> 00:28:31.740]   It was prophesied.
[00:28:31.740 --> 00:28:34.020]   It was made clear to Mary and Joseph.
[00:28:34.020 --> 00:28:35.700]   And it was prophesied for hundreds of years
[00:28:35.700 --> 00:28:37.100]   even before Jesus showed up.
[00:28:37.100 --> 00:28:39.780]   So when Jesus says, it's not my time,
[00:28:39.780 --> 00:28:42.980]   meaning that it's not my time to be doing this
[00:28:42.980 --> 00:28:45.400]   because the reason why he's performing miracles
[00:28:45.400 --> 00:28:47.260]   was to prepare himself to go to the cross.
[00:28:47.260 --> 00:28:48.700]   He says, not my time yet.
[00:28:48.700 --> 00:28:50.680]   Again, what this teaches me is
[00:28:50.680 --> 00:28:53.140]   Mary is responding like any other mother.
[00:28:53.140 --> 00:28:59.180]   And I'm thinking, Jesus probably performed some miracles.
[00:28:59.180 --> 00:29:02.660]   He probably did some stuff that Mary knew about.
[00:29:02.660 --> 00:29:05.780]   And he said, wow, my son, he has a special gift.
[00:29:05.780 --> 00:29:06.900]   And so that's probably why he's saying,
[00:29:06.900 --> 00:29:09.140]   if anybody can fix this, my son Jesus can fix this.
[00:29:09.140 --> 00:29:11.420]   And that kind of reminds me of any mother.
[00:29:11.420 --> 00:29:12.900]   If your son's a doctor or a lawyer
[00:29:12.900 --> 00:29:14.820]   and you have a close friend who has problems,
[00:29:14.820 --> 00:29:16.540]   say, oh, my son will take care of you.
[00:29:16.540 --> 00:29:17.780]   Don't worry about it.
[00:29:17.780 --> 00:29:18.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:29:18.620 --> 00:29:21.020]   And that's the scene that I see in John chapter two
[00:29:21.020 --> 00:29:22.140]   in the very first miracle.
[00:29:22.140 --> 00:29:24.940]   Jesus, Jesus' mom just being mom.
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:27.020]   That's my son.
[00:29:27.020 --> 00:29:29.460]   Oh, you don't have wine?
[00:29:29.460 --> 00:29:30.460]   My son could take care of it.
[00:29:30.460 --> 00:29:32.900]   And Jesus is like, wait, wait, wait.
[00:29:32.900 --> 00:29:35.460]   All these things, ultimately,
[00:29:35.460 --> 00:29:36.660]   is to lead me to the cross.
[00:29:36.780 --> 00:29:39.300]   Again, the picture that I see with Mary,
[00:29:39.300 --> 00:29:43.300]   and when the angel said to Mary that you are blessed,
[00:29:43.300 --> 00:29:45.620]   that you are particularly chosen,
[00:29:45.620 --> 00:29:50.620]   and I know birthing the son of God is a special privilege
[00:29:50.620 --> 00:29:56.300]   that no one else but her was able to experience.
[00:29:56.300 --> 00:29:59.940]   But I think the true blessing of Mary with her
[00:29:59.940 --> 00:30:03.380]   is that her affections for Christ went way beyond
[00:30:03.380 --> 00:30:06.060]   him being the Messiah and the Savior.
[00:30:06.060 --> 00:30:09.180]   That was her son that she raised.
[00:30:09.180 --> 00:30:12.500]   And yet, the reason why we venerate her,
[00:30:12.500 --> 00:30:13.820]   and the reason why the Catholic Church,
[00:30:13.820 --> 00:30:17.700]   again, in confusion, decided to venerate her
[00:30:17.700 --> 00:30:22.700]   was because from the very get-go, when Mary died,
[00:30:22.700 --> 00:30:25.660]   and this is according to church history,
[00:30:25.660 --> 00:30:27.700]   that as early as Mary's death,
[00:30:27.700 --> 00:30:29.300]   the people began to venerate her and say,
[00:30:29.300 --> 00:30:31.020]   wow, she must have been a special woman,
[00:30:31.020 --> 00:30:33.340]   and then that kind of evolved in the fourth century
[00:30:33.340 --> 00:30:36.540]   in Arabia, turned into an actual worship of Mary,
[00:30:36.540 --> 00:30:39.500]   and then that kind of crept into the church gradually,
[00:30:39.500 --> 00:30:40.980]   where it is what it is today,
[00:30:40.980 --> 00:30:42.980]   where they call her co-redemptress.
[00:30:42.980 --> 00:30:45.660]   So that part of it, we need to be very careful.
[00:30:45.660 --> 00:30:50.380]   But the fact that Mary was chosen to raise a child,
[00:30:50.380 --> 00:30:55.380]   and at the end had to give him up and sacrifice,
[00:30:55.380 --> 00:30:58.420]   even though it was the Father who sent him,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.180]   Mary was at the cross.
[00:31:00.180 --> 00:31:02.960]   Mary saw him being crucified.
[00:31:03.960 --> 00:31:06.360]   And was with him to the very end.
[00:31:06.360 --> 00:31:07.560]   When we look at all the mothers,
[00:31:07.560 --> 00:31:09.740]   when I look at the scripture and look at all the mothers
[00:31:09.740 --> 00:31:13.000]   that we would choose as examples,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:14.040]   any one of these mothers,
[00:31:14.040 --> 00:31:15.560]   I could spend this whole day talking about
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:17.360]   how this is a great mother,
[00:31:17.360 --> 00:31:20.920]   and how we ought to venerate them and honor them.
[00:31:20.920 --> 00:31:22.960]   There's a unifying factor in every single one
[00:31:22.960 --> 00:31:25.640]   of these mothers that is mentioned in scripture.
[00:31:25.640 --> 00:31:27.180]   We don't normally talk about them
[00:31:27.180 --> 00:31:29.160]   because they're always in the background.
[00:31:29.160 --> 00:31:30.880]   We talk about their son.
[00:31:30.880 --> 00:31:32.640]   We talk about their children.
[00:31:32.640 --> 00:31:35.360]   Because God used them to bring them about,
[00:31:35.360 --> 00:31:37.520]   so the main character is the son.
[00:31:37.520 --> 00:31:40.400]   But there's always a mother in the background.
[00:31:40.400 --> 00:31:43.100]   And one of these ladies that stand out is Hannah.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:48.520]   Hannah didn't have a child until she was way late in years.
[00:31:48.520 --> 00:31:49.680]   She cried out to God and said,
[00:31:49.680 --> 00:31:52.480]   "If you give me a child, I will sacrifice him,
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.120]   "and I will dedicate him for your service."
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.840]   So God hears her prayers.
[00:31:57.840 --> 00:32:01.000]   So she's able to have a child in her old age.
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.400]   And then the scripture says that when he was strong enough,
[00:32:05.400 --> 00:32:07.640]   that he delivered, he had to drop off this child
[00:32:07.640 --> 00:32:11.840]   at the temple to the priest Eli, and then go back home.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:13.640]   Can you imagine that?
[00:32:13.640 --> 00:32:15.840]   Having a child and then raising him,
[00:32:15.840 --> 00:32:19.160]   going through the hardship of weaning this child,
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:20.480]   and as soon as he's strong enough,
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:21.840]   you take him to the temple?
[00:32:21.840 --> 00:32:23.520]   Well, that's what Hannah did.
[00:32:23.520 --> 00:32:24.960]   And that's what we remember about Hannah.
[00:32:24.960 --> 00:32:27.980]   And one of the most touching scenes, to me,
[00:32:27.980 --> 00:32:30.160]   that I see in scripture about the mother's love
[00:32:30.160 --> 00:32:33.240]   is mentioned in 1 Samuel 2, 18-19.
[00:32:33.240 --> 00:32:37.160]   Because she dedicated Samuel to the service of God,
[00:32:37.160 --> 00:32:40.600]   and God raises this prophet up in a period of Israel
[00:32:40.600 --> 00:32:43.840]   that was in desperate need of prophets
[00:32:43.840 --> 00:32:46.740]   who were gonna speak up for God and not be afraid of man.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:51.600]   Well, she delivers him up to the temple,
[00:32:51.600 --> 00:32:53.160]   and it says she never forgot about him.
[00:32:53.160 --> 00:32:55.320]   Every year, she would go up and visit him.
[00:32:55.320 --> 00:32:58.520]   And this is what it says in 1 Samuel 2, 18-19.
[00:32:58.520 --> 00:33:00.400]   Samuel was ministering before the Lord,
[00:33:00.400 --> 00:33:03.320]   a boy clothed with a linen ephod.
[00:33:03.320 --> 00:33:08.120]   And his mother, Hannah, used to make for him a little robe
[00:33:08.120 --> 00:33:10.480]   and take it to him each year when she went up
[00:33:10.480 --> 00:33:12.960]   with her husband to offer the yearly sacrifice.
[00:33:12.960 --> 00:33:16.560]   You say, "Oh." (laughs)
[00:33:16.560 --> 00:33:17.600]   Right?
[00:33:17.600 --> 00:33:19.680]   You see a picture of Hannah,
[00:33:19.680 --> 00:33:22.440]   never forgot about her son, Samuel.
[00:33:22.440 --> 00:33:24.600]   And Samuel's ministering in his little robe,
[00:33:24.600 --> 00:33:27.760]   and his mom is at home every year making this little robe
[00:33:27.760 --> 00:33:29.240]   so that Samuel can wear.
[00:33:29.240 --> 00:33:30.960]   And every year, she says she went
[00:33:30.960 --> 00:33:32.800]   and she made this little robe to give to him.
[00:33:32.800 --> 00:33:34.940]   Can you imagine the sacrifice for Hannah?
[00:33:34.940 --> 00:33:36.760]   Again, it's biblical history, and we look at it,
[00:33:36.760 --> 00:33:38.360]   and we just kind of skim over it.
[00:33:38.360 --> 00:33:41.240]   But put yourself in that situation, right?
[00:33:41.240 --> 00:33:44.820]   Hannah sacrificed for the service of the Lord.
[00:33:44.820 --> 00:33:46.640]   We look at Elizabeth.
[00:33:46.640 --> 00:33:48.760]   Elizabeth's another lady who was in old age,
[00:33:48.760 --> 00:33:50.240]   and God hears her prayers.
[00:33:50.240 --> 00:33:53.340]   And so John the Baptist comes from her,
[00:33:53.340 --> 00:33:56.620]   and she raises this prophet up.
[00:33:56.620 --> 00:33:58.360]   And when the right time comes,
[00:33:58.360 --> 00:34:00.920]   he prepares a way for his cousin Jesus,
[00:34:00.920 --> 00:34:02.640]   and then when his work is done,
[00:34:02.640 --> 00:34:04.720]   he's beheaded and he's gone.
[00:34:04.720 --> 00:34:07.120]   And behind this great man, according to Jesus,
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.360]   the greatest man who was born of a woman, John the Baptist,
[00:34:11.360 --> 00:34:12.920]   there was a mother behind him
[00:34:12.920 --> 00:34:15.180]   who raised him, took care of him.
[00:34:15.180 --> 00:34:18.980]   You look at Salome, the mother of James and John.
[00:34:18.980 --> 00:34:23.200]   This is the mother who was following Jesus from Galilee
[00:34:23.200 --> 00:34:26.480]   and was begging Jesus, "When you go to your kingdom,
[00:34:26.480 --> 00:34:29.880]   "you make sure you sit on the left or to the right."
[00:34:29.880 --> 00:34:31.760]   And Jesus kind of gently rebukes her and says,
[00:34:31.760 --> 00:34:34.780]   "Well, I don't have the power to do that.
[00:34:34.780 --> 00:34:36.860]   "My father will do that, but what I can give you
[00:34:36.860 --> 00:34:39.660]   "is that can you drink the cup that I drink?"
[00:34:39.660 --> 00:34:42.660]   And not knowing what he was talking about,
[00:34:42.660 --> 00:34:44.340]   he said, "Yes, we can do that."
[00:34:44.340 --> 00:34:46.980]   Well, we can be harsh on them,
[00:34:46.980 --> 00:34:50.220]   but later on we see when Jesus is hanging on the cross,
[00:34:50.220 --> 00:34:52.980]   Salome was one of the mothers who stuck with Jesus
[00:34:52.980 --> 00:34:56.060]   to the very end, ministering to them.
[00:34:56.060 --> 00:34:58.160]   All those times that they were traveling for three years,
[00:34:58.160 --> 00:35:00.440]   there were mothers traveling with them,
[00:35:00.440 --> 00:35:04.740]   cooking for them, cleaning for them, picking up after them.
[00:35:04.740 --> 00:35:06.320]   See, mothers were there from the beginning
[00:35:06.320 --> 00:35:08.720]   until the very end, and then later on,
[00:35:08.720 --> 00:35:11.420]   we see those two sons, they're the one
[00:35:11.420 --> 00:35:14.740]   that she wanted to sit on the left and the right, right?
[00:35:14.740 --> 00:35:18.460]   And John is cast out into the island of Patmos
[00:35:18.460 --> 00:35:20.780]   for the rest of his life, and James becomes
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.400]   the first martyr among all the disciples.
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:24.960]   Not the first martyr to mention in Acts,
[00:35:24.960 --> 00:35:27.440]   but the first martyr among the disciples.
[00:35:27.440 --> 00:35:30.340]   And behind these great men, there's these women.
[00:35:30.340 --> 00:35:35.080]   The last person I wanna mention is Eunice.
[00:35:35.080 --> 00:35:39.980]   Eunice is Timothy's mom, and then the grandma is Lois,
[00:35:39.980 --> 00:35:44.480]   and we see Timothy shows up on the scene in Acts 16.
[00:35:44.480 --> 00:35:48.320]   In Acts 16, Paul comes to the city of Lystra
[00:35:48.320 --> 00:35:52.560]   and recognizes this young man who is great of faith
[00:35:52.560 --> 00:35:54.780]   and chooses to take him with him on his journeys
[00:35:54.780 --> 00:35:55.800]   from that point on.
[00:35:55.800 --> 00:35:59.300]   Most commentators believe that Timothy
[00:35:59.300 --> 00:36:02.980]   was probably no more than about 15 years old at that time.
[00:36:02.980 --> 00:36:06.540]   Can you imagine letting your 15-year-old child
[00:36:06.540 --> 00:36:07.740]   go with this apostle?
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:10.460]   And I know he's an apostle, and he's already famous,
[00:36:10.460 --> 00:36:13.860]   but everywhere he went, if for every one person
[00:36:13.860 --> 00:36:16.720]   that loved Paul and followed Paul,
[00:36:16.720 --> 00:36:19.860]   there probably was 100 other people that wanted him dead.
[00:36:19.860 --> 00:36:21.540]   And Paul didn't have a good track record.
[00:36:21.540 --> 00:36:24.020]   He was already beaten, imprisoned, persecuted,
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:25.500]   chased out of every city.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.380]   Can you imagine a mother offering your child
[00:36:28.380 --> 00:36:30.420]   to follow this man?
[00:36:30.420 --> 00:36:32.560]   There's a good chance that this man is going to die,
[00:36:32.560 --> 00:36:37.300]   just like Jesus died, and offered him up to him.
[00:36:37.300 --> 00:36:40.140]   And we see in 2 Timothy, as Paul is dying,
[00:36:40.140 --> 00:36:45.140]   and he's giving the baton to his disciple, it's Timothy.
[00:36:45.140 --> 00:36:49.500]   Most people believe that Timothy probably
[00:36:49.500 --> 00:36:52.300]   didn't have his dad from early on.
[00:36:52.300 --> 00:36:54.180]   That's why his name is not mentioned.
[00:36:54.180 --> 00:36:57.700]   So most likely, Eunice raised him as a single mother,
[00:36:57.700 --> 00:36:59.620]   and then Lois, that's why the grandmother
[00:36:59.620 --> 00:37:01.560]   is so prominent in his life,
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:03.360]   because the father probably was not there.
[00:37:03.360 --> 00:37:06.340]   So imagine being a single mom, raising this child,
[00:37:06.340 --> 00:37:09.140]   maybe thinking that after he gets old enough
[00:37:09.140 --> 00:37:11.500]   that he's going to take care of you or something,
[00:37:11.500 --> 00:37:14.720]   and then because of the love for Christ,
[00:37:14.720 --> 00:37:17.300]   because they were so deeply affected by the gospel,
[00:37:17.300 --> 00:37:21.140]   not only were they willing to follow Paul
[00:37:21.140 --> 00:37:23.020]   and to be a disciple of Jesus Christ,
[00:37:23.020 --> 00:37:26.220]   they gave up their son that he may also follow.
[00:37:26.220 --> 00:37:29.780]   The unifying thing that we see with all of these moms
[00:37:29.780 --> 00:37:32.820]   is that their faith was great enough
[00:37:32.820 --> 00:37:34.380]   that they would give their children,
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:38.620]   they dedicated their children for the sake of God's service.
[00:37:38.620 --> 00:37:43.480]   Now I would say this to all the young moms in this room.
[00:37:43.480 --> 00:37:48.780]   There is a great temptation when you become a mother
[00:37:48.780 --> 00:37:50.980]   or father for the first time.
[00:37:50.980 --> 00:37:53.500]   And you get to that point in the road in your life
[00:37:53.500 --> 00:37:55.740]   where you have to make a decision.
[00:37:55.740 --> 00:37:58.220]   And when you first meet Christ, you make that decision.
[00:37:58.220 --> 00:38:00.640]   I want to follow Christ, and I don't care if I become rich,
[00:38:00.640 --> 00:38:02.320]   I want to pick up my cross.
[00:38:02.320 --> 00:38:04.120]   But when that child comes into your life,
[00:38:04.120 --> 00:38:07.800]   all of a sudden you have another reason to become worldly.
[00:38:07.800 --> 00:38:11.380]   And I must honestly say, every temptation
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.440]   that I have in life is directly related
[00:38:13.440 --> 00:38:15.820]   to my kids and my family.
[00:38:15.820 --> 00:38:20.300]   I've never desired to have nice things until I had kids,
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.700]   because I wanted what's best for them.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.860]   I want to provide what's best for them,
[00:38:23.860 --> 00:38:25.540]   I want to give them the best education.
[00:38:25.540 --> 00:38:27.500]   I don't want them to feel left out at school.
[00:38:27.500 --> 00:38:29.300]   So there is a great temptation.
[00:38:29.300 --> 00:38:32.900]   And the warning and encouragement that I give you
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:36.160]   is a lot of times the temptation that we have
[00:38:36.160 --> 00:38:38.820]   is because it's our kids, it's for our kids.
[00:38:38.820 --> 00:38:40.740]   And our kids become our idol.
[00:38:40.740 --> 00:38:43.020]   And you live the rest of your life,
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:44.580]   everything that you wouldn't do for yourself,
[00:38:44.580 --> 00:38:46.420]   you're doing it with the excuse for this kid.
[00:38:46.420 --> 00:38:49.740]   And all of a sudden, you're living for your child.
[00:38:49.740 --> 00:38:51.060]   And everything that you're buying,
[00:38:51.060 --> 00:38:52.060]   everything that you're doing,
[00:38:52.060 --> 00:38:54.340]   every decision you're making is justified
[00:38:54.340 --> 00:38:56.060]   because you say you're being a good dad,
[00:38:56.060 --> 00:38:57.560]   or you're being a good mother.
[00:38:57.560 --> 00:39:01.120]   Scripture says, what good is it if you profit,
[00:39:01.120 --> 00:39:04.220]   if you gain the whole world, and you forfeit your soul?
[00:39:04.220 --> 00:39:07.260]   Any mother in this room,
[00:39:07.260 --> 00:39:08.940]   no matter how strong of a Christian you are,
[00:39:08.940 --> 00:39:11.940]   however you are struggling with your faith,
[00:39:11.940 --> 00:39:14.180]   every mother would say, what good is it
[00:39:14.180 --> 00:39:16.100]   if you provide everything that you can provide
[00:39:16.100 --> 00:39:19.620]   for this child, and yet he does not know Christ?
[00:39:20.220 --> 00:39:25.220]   Let me wrap up with this illustration.
[00:39:25.220 --> 00:39:28.680]   Parenting is kind of like daycare.
[00:39:28.680 --> 00:39:30.880]   If you take your child to a daycare,
[00:39:30.880 --> 00:39:33.740]   you don't drop the kid off and say, hey, my work is done.
[00:39:33.740 --> 00:39:39.140]   Now is your responsibility, hopefully things will work out.
[00:39:39.140 --> 00:39:41.300]   You drop off the kid, and what you would tell
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:44.920]   the daycare leaders is that, hey,
[00:39:44.920 --> 00:39:47.060]   the best that you can hope for the daycare
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:51.060]   is to represent you in that situation
[00:39:51.060 --> 00:39:53.020]   because you can't physically be there,
[00:39:53.020 --> 00:39:55.860]   to love that child as you would love that child,
[00:39:55.860 --> 00:39:58.420]   to teach that child as you would teach that child,
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:40:00.440]   to take care of that child
[00:40:00.440 --> 00:40:02.640]   as you would take care of that child.
[00:40:02.640 --> 00:40:05.140]   And you wouldn't want to put him in any situation
[00:40:05.140 --> 00:40:08.900]   that that daycare person is gonna contradict
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.620]   what you're gonna tell him because you're a steward.
[00:40:13.700 --> 00:40:17.820]   And in the same way, that's what parenting is.
[00:40:17.820 --> 00:40:20.360]   You and I are only stewards.
[00:40:20.360 --> 00:40:24.380]   The real Father is up in heaven.
[00:40:24.380 --> 00:40:27.940]   We have these children for a brief period of time,
[00:40:27.940 --> 00:40:30.220]   and the best job that you and I can do
[00:40:30.220 --> 00:40:34.020]   is to reflect their heavenly Father
[00:40:34.020 --> 00:40:36.420]   so that when they are thankful to me,
[00:40:36.420 --> 00:40:38.260]   the greatest thing that they will be thankful to me
[00:40:38.260 --> 00:40:41.340]   is that they were able to meet their heavenly Father
[00:40:41.340 --> 00:40:42.820]   up in heaven for eternity.
[00:40:42.820 --> 00:40:46.180]   We only have these children for a short period of time,
[00:40:46.180 --> 00:40:47.740]   and during this short period of time
[00:40:47.740 --> 00:40:52.140]   is to prepare them so that they can meet their Father.
[00:40:52.140 --> 00:40:56.260]   Our greatest responsibility as parents and as mothers
[00:40:56.260 --> 00:40:58.500]   is to introduce the love of Christ,
[00:40:58.500 --> 00:41:00.020]   what you and I cannot possibly do.
[00:41:00.020 --> 00:41:04.340]   As great as your love may be,
[00:41:04.340 --> 00:41:07.580]   you will never come close to the love of Christ.
[00:41:07.580 --> 00:41:11.500]   And if all they see in life is that they're thankful to you,
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.940]   but they're not thankful beyond you,
[00:41:13.940 --> 00:41:16.700]   then at the end of your life, you have not done them service.
[00:41:16.700 --> 00:41:18.220]   It's no different than a daycare
[00:41:18.220 --> 00:41:21.540]   who pulls this child away from his parents,
[00:41:21.540 --> 00:41:23.660]   said, "I'm doing a great job caring for them,"
[00:41:23.660 --> 00:41:25.520]   but they never know their parents.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:29.060]   See, every one of these great moms in the Bible,
[00:41:29.060 --> 00:41:33.020]   there's a unifying theme of each one.
[00:41:33.020 --> 00:41:37.220]   They were behind the scene, and they sacrificed greatly
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:40.220]   in order that their children,
[00:41:40.220 --> 00:41:44.940]   whether it was Jesus, John the Baptist, Samuel, or Timothy,
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:48.800]   that every single one of them gave sacrificially
[00:41:48.800 --> 00:41:51.780]   in order for that they may be used for God's glory.
[00:41:51.780 --> 00:41:54.780]   Again, so I wanna encourage all of us this morning,
[00:41:54.780 --> 00:41:56.980]   especially because there are so many young families
[00:41:56.980 --> 00:41:58.780]   popping up left and right.
[00:41:58.780 --> 00:42:02.660]   And the trend is that when you have your first child,
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:05.180]   that that child can easily become your idol,
[00:42:05.180 --> 00:42:08.380]   and that your life and your walk with God
[00:42:08.380 --> 00:42:11.940]   begins to drift, and all of it justified
[00:42:11.940 --> 00:42:13.780]   because of this child.
[00:42:13.780 --> 00:42:17.180]   So my encouragement to you, my challenge to you this morning
[00:42:17.180 --> 00:42:20.340]   is that make sure that Christ
[00:42:20.340 --> 00:42:22.540]   is what you are representing to this child.
[00:42:22.540 --> 00:42:26.680]   And it doesn't matter how many Sunday school lessons
[00:42:26.680 --> 00:42:29.420]   you give, it doesn't matter how many Bible memory verses,
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:30.880]   and a lot of times parents get angry
[00:42:30.880 --> 00:42:32.220]   because the children are a certain way,
[00:42:32.220 --> 00:42:33.680]   and they blame the Sunday school.
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:37.140]   They only spend Sunday school one hour a week.
[00:42:37.140 --> 00:42:40.200]   They're with you the rest of the time during the week.
[00:42:40.200 --> 00:42:43.980]   They will learn more from what you are doing
[00:42:43.980 --> 00:42:45.240]   than what you are saying.
[00:42:45.240 --> 00:42:48.620]   So again, this is a tough job.
[00:42:48.620 --> 00:42:52.020]   This is an extremely tough job.
[00:42:52.020 --> 00:42:54.820]   I stayed home with Jeremy for about a year and a half
[00:42:54.820 --> 00:42:58.860]   when he was a little kid, and I honestly say,
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:02.180]   I've had all kinds of jobs, cleaning toilets,
[00:43:02.180 --> 00:43:05.100]   washing cars, digging ditches, I've had all kinds of jobs.
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.040]   And I have to honestly say from the bottom of my heart,
[00:43:07.040 --> 00:43:08.780]   that was the toughest thing I've done.
[00:43:08.780 --> 00:43:11.500]   A year and a half, I was home with Jeremy.
[00:43:11.500 --> 00:43:13.860]   And we just financially, we just couldn't handle it.
[00:43:13.860 --> 00:43:17.860]   And so Esther was at work, and I remember very specifically,
[00:43:17.860 --> 00:43:20.620]   3.30 came around, 'cause that's when she got off work.
[00:43:20.620 --> 00:43:24.460]   We were by the front door, and I had Jeremy with me
[00:43:24.460 --> 00:43:27.980]   in my arms, when that door opened, hello, Mommy.
[00:43:27.980 --> 00:43:31.060]   And it was that draining.
[00:43:31.060 --> 00:43:33.180]   I mean, especially for a father,
[00:43:33.180 --> 00:43:36.580]   it's just not second nature to me.
[00:43:36.580 --> 00:43:40.120]   So the work for the mothers is extremely difficult,
[00:43:40.120 --> 00:43:42.800]   and that is why the church needs to honor them.
[00:43:42.800 --> 00:43:45.940]   'Cause if our mothers are not honored,
[00:43:45.940 --> 00:43:49.460]   and they cannot do their job that God called them to do,
[00:43:49.460 --> 00:43:51.740]   then it is not just the mothers who will be discouraged.
[00:43:51.740 --> 00:43:53.820]   When the mothers are discouraged,
[00:43:53.820 --> 00:43:55.460]   then the families will fall apart.
[00:43:55.460 --> 00:43:57.980]   When the family falls apart, the church falls apart.
[00:43:57.980 --> 00:44:01.200]   When the church falls apart, God is not glorified.
[00:44:01.200 --> 00:44:04.600]   So this is not just about mothers.
[00:44:04.600 --> 00:44:08.380]   This is about being true worshipers, honoring God,
[00:44:08.380 --> 00:44:12.060]   spreading the gospel, exalting Christ.
[00:44:12.060 --> 00:44:14.180]   And that's why this day has to be set apart,
[00:44:14.180 --> 00:44:15.800]   where we are honoring our mothers.
[00:44:15.800 --> 00:44:16.640]   Let's pray.
[00:44:16.640 --> 00:44:23.020]   Gracious Father, we wanna continue to bless and thank you
[00:44:23.020 --> 00:44:25.040]   for who you are and what you give us.
[00:44:25.040 --> 00:44:29.980]   And I pray, Lord God, that you would use this day
[00:44:29.980 --> 00:44:32.900]   to encourage the discouraged,
[00:44:32.900 --> 00:44:34.600]   to strengthen those who are weak,
[00:44:34.600 --> 00:44:37.340]   to remember those, Lord,
[00:44:37.340 --> 00:44:40.140]   who are laboring the most in our lives.
[00:44:40.140 --> 00:44:41.580]   We thank you for them, Lord God,
[00:44:41.580 --> 00:44:45.220]   who we are able to see the tangible love of Christ
[00:44:45.220 --> 00:44:47.340]   because of their tangible work for us.
