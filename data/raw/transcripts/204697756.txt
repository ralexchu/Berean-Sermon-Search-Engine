[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:14.760]   So, we want to start tonight's study by reading a bigger chunk of the scripture by way of
[00:00:14.760 --> 00:00:17.000]   following through the flow of thought.
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.280]   So it's going to take about four minutes or so, but I'm going to read all of chapter two.
[00:00:21.280 --> 00:00:27.520]   I'm reading out of the NASB, but how many of you guys, just a quick question, how many
[00:00:27.520 --> 00:00:30.120]   of you guys have ESV?
[00:00:30.120 --> 00:00:31.120]   Vast majority of you.
[00:00:31.120 --> 00:00:32.120]   Okay.
[00:00:32.120 --> 00:00:37.100]   I'm just going to, for the sake of, then I'll read out of the ESV too, although the study
[00:00:37.100 --> 00:00:39.200]   is kind of done in the NASB.
[00:00:39.200 --> 00:00:40.200]   Okay.
[00:00:40.200 --> 00:00:47.580]   So, taking a look at 1 Peter chapter two, it says, "So put away all malice and all deceit
[00:00:47.580 --> 00:00:52.960]   and hypocrisy and envy and all slander, like newborn infants long for the pure spiritual
[00:00:52.960 --> 00:00:56.720]   milk that by it you may grow up into salvation.
[00:00:56.720 --> 00:01:01.640]   If indeed you have tasted that the Lord is good, as you come to him a living stone rejected
[00:01:01.640 --> 00:01:06.480]   by men, but in the sight of God chosen and precious, you yourselves like living stones
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:12.800]   are being built up as a spiritual house to be a holy priesthood, to offer spiritual sacrifices
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:15.800]   acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[00:01:15.800 --> 00:01:21.640]   For it stands in scripture, behold, I am laying in Zion a stone, a cornerstone chosen and
[00:01:21.640 --> 00:01:25.700]   precious and whoever believes in him will not be put to shame.
[00:01:25.700 --> 00:01:30.260]   So the honor is for you who believe, but for those who do not believe the stone that the
[00:01:30.260 --> 00:01:36.780]   builders rejected has become the cornerstone and a stone of stumbling and a rock of offense.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:40.960]   They stumble because they disobey the word as they were destined to do.
[00:01:40.960 --> 00:01:47.380]   But you are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation, a people for his own possession
[00:01:47.380 --> 00:01:51.780]   that you may proclaim the excellencies of him who called you out of darkness into his
[00:01:51.780 --> 00:01:53.700]   marvelous light.
[00:01:53.700 --> 00:01:56.940]   Once you are not a people, but now you are God's people.
[00:01:56.940 --> 00:02:00.820]   Once you had not received mercy, but now you have received mercy.
[00:02:00.820 --> 00:02:05.860]   Beloved, I urge you as sojourners and exiles to abstain from the passions of the flesh,
[00:02:05.860 --> 00:02:08.220]   which wage war against your soul.
[00:02:08.220 --> 00:02:12.340]   Keep your conduct among the Gentiles honorable so that when they speak against you as evil
[00:02:12.340 --> 00:02:17.700]   doers, they may see your good deeds and glorify God on the day of visitation.
[00:02:17.700 --> 00:02:21.820]   Be subject for the Lord's sake to every human institution, whether it be the emperor as
[00:02:21.820 --> 00:02:27.460]   supreme or to governors as sent by him to punish those who do evil and to praise those
[00:02:27.460 --> 00:02:28.460]   who do good.
[00:02:28.460 --> 00:02:33.440]   For this is the will of God, that by doing good, you should put to silence the ignorance
[00:02:33.440 --> 00:02:35.400]   of the foolish people.
[00:02:35.400 --> 00:02:40.060]   Live as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover up for evil, but living
[00:02:40.060 --> 00:02:42.020]   as servants of God.
[00:02:42.020 --> 00:02:47.500]   Honor everyone, love the brotherhood, fear God, honor the emperor.
[00:02:47.500 --> 00:02:51.540]   Servants be subject to your masters with all respect, not only to the good and gentle,
[00:02:51.540 --> 00:02:53.140]   but also to the unjust.
[00:02:53.140 --> 00:02:58.060]   For this is a gracious thing, when mindful of God, one endures sorrows while suffering
[00:02:58.060 --> 00:02:59.520]   unjustly.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:03.900]   For what credit is it if when you sin and are beaten for it, you endure?
[00:03:03.900 --> 00:03:08.020]   But if when you do good and suffer for it, you endure, this is a gracious thing in the
[00:03:08.020 --> 00:03:09.820]   sight of God.
[00:03:09.820 --> 00:03:14.100]   For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, giving you an
[00:03:14.100 --> 00:03:16.980]   example so that you might follow in his steps.
[00:03:16.980 --> 00:03:20.540]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:03:20.540 --> 00:03:23.060]   When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:03:23.060 --> 00:03:27.940]   When he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges
[00:03:27.940 --> 00:03:29.140]   justly.
[00:03:29.140 --> 00:03:34.060]   He himself bore our sins in his body on the tree, that he might die to sin and live to
[00:03:34.060 --> 00:03:35.340]   righteousness.
[00:03:35.340 --> 00:03:37.300]   By his wounds, you have been healed.
[00:03:37.300 --> 00:03:44.660]   For you are straying like sheep, but now return to the shepherd and overseer of your souls.
[00:03:44.660 --> 00:03:46.300]   Amen.
[00:03:46.300 --> 00:03:51.900]   As we looked at this section, I asked the question for homework, how does this flow
[00:03:51.900 --> 00:03:53.300]   in terms of thought?
[00:03:53.300 --> 00:03:58.180]   How does this flow in terms of the progression of the commands and exhortations that he's
[00:03:58.180 --> 00:03:59.600]   been making?
[00:03:59.600 --> 00:04:05.500]   For your ESV Bible, it almost appears as though I cut off right in the middle of the paragraph.
[00:04:05.500 --> 00:04:10.120]   If you have the NIV or the NASB, they actually separate it in terms of paragraph between
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:13.540]   chapter five, verse 20 and verse 21.
[00:04:13.540 --> 00:04:14.540]   Okay.
[00:04:14.540 --> 00:04:20.140]   So, by way of answering that question, how does the flow of thought work, I read to you
[00:04:20.140 --> 00:04:21.860]   chapter two.
[00:04:21.860 --> 00:04:26.700]   The whole thing actually goes together starting from, remember the end of chapter one.
[00:04:26.700 --> 00:04:31.020]   I wanted to read all of it, but I don't want to take the whole time just reading straight,
[00:04:31.020 --> 00:04:32.020]   right?
[00:04:32.020 --> 00:04:33.660]   All of it flows in thought.
[00:04:33.660 --> 00:04:37.780]   So it's a good and regular pattern for us once we started through the Bible, once you
[00:04:37.780 --> 00:04:41.860]   get towards the middle, to start reading from the beginning to where you're at, okay?
[00:04:41.860 --> 00:04:43.260]   Because it helps you retain the thought.
[00:04:43.260 --> 00:04:48.340]   Well, the thought that we've been at is that God had challenged us through the scriptures
[00:04:48.340 --> 00:04:53.540]   and the apostle Peter is challenging his readers that for the Lord's sake, you need to learn
[00:04:53.540 --> 00:04:57.940]   to surrender and submit, right?
[00:04:57.940 --> 00:05:02.460]   That you're experiencing a vast array of various trials and all this kind of stuff.
[00:05:02.460 --> 00:05:05.740]   And he says, you know what though, you're this chosen race.
[00:05:05.740 --> 00:05:12.220]   God has a very incredibly long waited and incredibly significant purpose for you.
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.900]   And all the suffering and all the things that you're experiencing fall just in line with
[00:05:15.900 --> 00:05:17.460]   God's plan.
[00:05:17.460 --> 00:05:23.860]   And so for the Lord's sake, okay, and let's start filling in your blanks by way of review.
[00:05:23.860 --> 00:05:29.300]   Verse 13, he said, be subject for the Lord's sake.
[00:05:29.300 --> 00:05:33.900]   In terms of the rationale and reasons for your submission to even authorities and your
[00:05:33.900 --> 00:05:38.140]   general attitude of submission, there was the Lord's sake.
[00:05:38.140 --> 00:05:43.220]   Verse 14, number two, this is designed by God.
[00:05:43.220 --> 00:05:50.900]   Verse 14 read that for governors, emperor is supreme or to governors as sent by him.
[00:05:50.900 --> 00:05:57.060]   To think and believe now by faith that even yes, those who would what, not only persecute
[00:05:57.060 --> 00:06:03.260]   the Jews, but even from generations before those who would come to judge, overthrow and
[00:06:03.260 --> 00:06:08.220]   oppress the Jews, God sent every nation.
[00:06:08.220 --> 00:06:11.340]   Number three, this is the will of God.
[00:06:11.340 --> 00:06:15.140]   That's what it says in verse 15 verbatim for this is the will of God.
[00:06:15.140 --> 00:06:16.140]   Right?
[00:06:16.140 --> 00:06:20.140]   That's another reason and rationale as to why we should submit.
[00:06:20.140 --> 00:06:24.420]   In your ESV it reads that this is gracious, it's a gracious thing.
[00:06:24.420 --> 00:06:27.460]   In other words, this is God's been so ingrace on you.
[00:06:27.460 --> 00:06:33.060]   The NIV and the NASB talk about as this is what God favors.
[00:06:33.060 --> 00:06:34.380]   Okay.
[00:06:34.380 --> 00:06:38.060]   Number four, to silence the foolish.
[00:06:38.060 --> 00:06:43.820]   By doing so you silence those who are foolish, who continue to revile and say all kinds of
[00:06:43.820 --> 00:06:46.020]   ignorant things.
[00:06:46.020 --> 00:06:51.460]   And then number five, he says for the sake of your conscience, right?
[00:06:51.460 --> 00:06:53.220]   For the sake of your conscience.
[00:06:53.220 --> 00:06:59.580]   In verse 19 he talks about how when you are mindful of God, this is your conscience before
[00:06:59.580 --> 00:07:01.020]   the Lord.
[00:07:01.020 --> 00:07:02.260]   Okay.
[00:07:02.260 --> 00:07:10.540]   So by way of kind of seeing the progression with this, what we're saying is this goes
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:14.740]   in line with the thought of asking the question, why should we surrender?
[00:07:14.740 --> 00:07:19.540]   Why should we submit and subject ourselves to these circumstances and situation where
[00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:23.980]   we so eagerly want to get out of?
[00:07:23.980 --> 00:07:28.260]   For a lot of us, we're a lot like students who want to get out of quizzes and exams.
[00:07:28.260 --> 00:07:32.020]   If we can, we can just weasel our way through classes or whatever it may be.
[00:07:32.020 --> 00:07:37.560]   These difficult circumstances are not things we sit and say, ah joy, right?
[00:07:37.560 --> 00:07:39.860]   But he wants us to have a greater perspective.
[00:07:39.860 --> 00:07:42.100]   They're not always things you have to revolt.
[00:07:42.100 --> 00:07:47.740]   They're not always things you have to retaliate and say, I can't stand this anymore.
[00:07:47.740 --> 00:07:49.180]   No.
[00:07:49.180 --> 00:07:54.020]   There are moments he says like this that are necessary for us to submit and subject
[00:07:54.020 --> 00:07:55.840]   ourselves underneath these things.
[00:07:55.840 --> 00:08:04.580]   And then he says in this last portion, some of the greatest reasons why you need to submit.
[00:08:04.580 --> 00:08:06.140]   Okay.
[00:08:06.140 --> 00:08:12.820]   Now in verse 21, which we begin our section in our study, he connects the previous thoughts
[00:08:12.820 --> 00:08:17.860]   and he says, for to this you have been called.
[00:08:17.860 --> 00:08:21.660]   And the NASB it says to this purpose.
[00:08:21.660 --> 00:08:26.020]   And I ask you the question, what is this referring to?
[00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.220]   Take a moment to think about that.
[00:08:28.220 --> 00:08:29.720]   Okay.
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:36.700]   What is this referring to when he says for this you have been called, right?
[00:08:36.700 --> 00:08:42.620]   Now it's kind of ante up like, man, not only am I just supposed to be like, oh well, whatever
[00:08:42.620 --> 00:08:44.740]   may be, so let it be.
[00:08:44.740 --> 00:08:45.740]   It is what it is.
[00:08:45.740 --> 00:08:49.860]   You know, that's like the kind of idiom that we like to say.
[00:08:49.860 --> 00:08:51.100]   Is that simply what he's saying?
[00:08:51.100 --> 00:08:55.660]   No, I think saying even more so, you were called for this.
[00:08:55.660 --> 00:08:58.140]   Now here's my question again.
[00:08:58.140 --> 00:09:00.140]   What is this?
[00:09:00.140 --> 00:09:03.100]   Oh, sorry.
[00:09:03.100 --> 00:09:08.420]   This one you can volunteer and then reply.
[00:09:08.420 --> 00:09:23.620]   What's this purpose?
[00:09:23.620 --> 00:09:27.020]   This was one of the easier ones, so you guys got to volunteer to do it.
[00:09:27.020 --> 00:09:28.500]   Yes, Aaron?
[00:09:28.500 --> 00:09:37.780]   I thought it was referring to verse 19 where it says that you endure sorrow, and sorrow
[00:09:37.780 --> 00:09:38.780]   is suffering.
[00:09:38.780 --> 00:09:39.780]   Okay, good.
[00:09:39.780 --> 00:09:44.620]   So when you think about that, he's saying, you know, just in the previous section, he
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.700]   was like, why should you suffer for doing silly stuff, right?
[00:09:49.700 --> 00:09:52.980]   You should suffer for doing right and what is good.
[00:09:52.980 --> 00:10:00.300]   So I have for you in your lesson plan, underneath it, it says the simple answer really, okay,
[00:10:00.300 --> 00:10:03.460]   the simple answer really is suffering, right?
[00:10:03.460 --> 00:10:06.540]   That you're called to this experience of suffering.
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:11.420]   However, you are also called to suffer for what is right.
[00:10:11.420 --> 00:10:13.420]   Okay?
[00:10:13.420 --> 00:10:18.420]   You weren't just called to suffer pointlessly, you were called to suffer for what is good,
[00:10:18.420 --> 00:10:25.540]   what is precious in the eyes of God, what is favorable in the eyes of God, right?
[00:10:25.540 --> 00:10:29.980]   But what's more, if we can elaborate on that a little more, so we get the simple answer
[00:10:29.980 --> 00:10:34.940]   of you were called for this from just the previous section, but then once we take a
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:41.260]   look at the passage, our passage for today, verse 21 through 25, we get this greater thought
[00:10:41.260 --> 00:10:46.780]   of what we're called to do, which is not only suffer for the right thing, but to suffer
[00:10:46.780 --> 00:10:48.780]   in the right way.
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:50.060]   Okay?
[00:10:50.060 --> 00:10:54.100]   So the answer to that question of what is this purpose we've been called to, if we want
[00:10:54.100 --> 00:10:56.760]   to just make it simple, yes, we were called to suffer.
[00:10:56.760 --> 00:11:00.260]   If we want to elaborate on that, we want to say we want to suffer for what is right and
[00:11:00.260 --> 00:11:05.260]   we want to suffer for what is, we want to suffer in the right way.
[00:11:05.260 --> 00:11:10.580]   And I want to review with you just the previous section, a couple of the things that he said.
[00:11:10.580 --> 00:11:16.860]   If you look at verse 16, which I apologize, I completely skipped last week, he says, "Live
[00:11:16.860 --> 00:11:22.940]   as people who are free, not using your freedom as a cover for evil, but living as servants
[00:11:22.940 --> 00:11:23.940]   of God."
[00:11:23.940 --> 00:11:27.980]   And just like Aaron said at verse 19, he says, "For this is a gracious thing, when mindful
[00:11:27.980 --> 00:11:31.260]   of God, one endures sorrow while suffering unjustly."
[00:11:31.260 --> 00:11:32.260]   Okay?
[00:11:32.260 --> 00:11:38.780]   I'm going to lump those two things together and kind of explain what does God expect here?
[00:11:38.780 --> 00:11:40.040]   You know?
[00:11:40.040 --> 00:11:42.420]   What is this thing God finds favorable?
[00:11:42.420 --> 00:11:45.420]   What is this purpose that you've been called to?
[00:11:45.420 --> 00:11:49.700]   And I want to summarize again, it is suffering for the right thing and it's suffering in
[00:11:49.700 --> 00:11:51.260]   the right way.
[00:11:51.260 --> 00:11:55.820]   Now, when you look at verse 16, he says, "Live as people who are free."
[00:11:55.820 --> 00:11:59.820]   What is he talking about right there?
[00:11:59.820 --> 00:12:04.460]   How can he say, "Live as people who are free," when in reality they're oppressed?
[00:12:04.460 --> 00:12:09.580]   And what's more, in the very next half of the sentence, he says, "And be good bond servants."
[00:12:09.580 --> 00:12:10.580]   Right?
[00:12:10.580 --> 00:12:14.900]   Well, I want to use an example to explain that a little bit.
[00:12:14.900 --> 00:12:17.100]   Yesterday was Valentine's Day.
[00:12:17.100 --> 00:12:18.100]   Okay?
[00:12:18.100 --> 00:12:21.820]   I want to ask you guys to think of a hypothetical scenario.
[00:12:21.820 --> 00:12:26.060]   Specifically for those of you who are married, for you ladies, think of this hypothetical
[00:12:26.060 --> 00:12:34.140]   scenario that, let's say, Valentine's coming up, you're expecting your significant other
[00:12:34.140 --> 00:12:40.100]   to do something good for you, to have prepared and planned, maybe made reservations in advance,
[00:12:40.100 --> 00:12:43.940]   I don't know, take you somewhere nice, all that kind of stuff.
[00:12:43.940 --> 00:12:48.980]   But on Valentine's Day, instead of your husband, some other guy at church, or maybe some other
[00:12:48.980 --> 00:12:52.180]   guy at your work, let's just call him Billy Bob, you know?
[00:12:52.180 --> 00:12:57.140]   Billy Bob comes up to you and is like, "I planned something amazing for us."
[00:12:57.140 --> 00:12:59.940]   And you're just like, "What?"
[00:12:59.940 --> 00:13:00.940]   You know?
[00:13:00.940 --> 00:13:05.260]   He's like, "I hope you cleared the whole night, because this is going to be the whole day."
[00:13:05.260 --> 00:13:09.500]   And you're just like, "What in the world is going on?"
[00:13:09.500 --> 00:13:10.500]   Right?
[00:13:10.500 --> 00:13:12.820]   Obviously, that just strikes you as completely wrong.
[00:13:12.820 --> 00:13:13.820]   Why?
[00:13:13.820 --> 00:13:18.940]   Because you and that individual has no relationship for that man to be planning anything for you.
[00:13:18.940 --> 00:13:19.940]   Right?
[00:13:19.940 --> 00:13:25.300]   Well, the fact of the matter is, in the context of a covenant relationship, you are what?
[00:13:25.300 --> 00:13:27.580]   Free to do that kind of stuff.
[00:13:27.580 --> 00:13:31.660]   When you have a covenant relationship, you are now free to kiss your bride.
[00:13:31.660 --> 00:13:34.520]   You're now free to do all that you covenanted to do.
[00:13:34.520 --> 00:13:36.780]   You're now free to do all that you vowed to do.
[00:13:36.780 --> 00:13:41.660]   You're free to engage in that kind of relationship, because you're free.
[00:13:41.660 --> 00:13:44.220]   You're in that relationship.
[00:13:44.220 --> 00:13:46.260]   It's the same with us and God.
[00:13:46.260 --> 00:13:54.540]   When He says, "So live as free," rather than an excuse to do all sorts of other stuff,
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:13:56.380]   be good bond servants.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:14:00.220]   You're free to operate and function the way God is expecting you in your relationship
[00:14:00.220 --> 00:14:01.220]   with Him.
[00:14:01.220 --> 00:14:02.220]   Right?
[00:14:02.220 --> 00:14:07.340]   And what's more, when we think about this, it all kind of joins together.
[00:14:07.340 --> 00:14:12.960]   To think that for our conscience sake before God, this is a precious thing, this is a favorable
[00:14:12.960 --> 00:14:16.540]   thing in God, that we need to be doing this.
[00:14:16.540 --> 00:14:20.780]   And on the flip side, for you guys, I want to make another point.
[00:14:20.780 --> 00:14:25.660]   If I asked one of you who are dating or who are married, and I said, "Hey, Valentine's
[00:14:25.660 --> 00:14:26.660]   coming up.
[00:14:26.660 --> 00:14:27.660]   What'd you plan?"
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.660]   And you're like, "Ahh, nothing."
[00:14:30.660 --> 00:14:35.520]   And obviously I'd be like, "Oh, shoot, last minute planning."
[00:14:35.520 --> 00:14:37.940]   But then you tell me, "I'm not going to do anything."
[00:14:37.940 --> 00:14:38.940]   I'm like, "Really?
[00:14:38.940 --> 00:14:39.940]   Everyone's doing something."
[00:14:39.940 --> 00:14:44.740]   And you say to me, "Ah, she probably won't care."
[00:14:44.740 --> 00:14:48.700]   You know, like, "That's what you think, man."
[00:14:48.700 --> 00:14:51.660]   They always say, "It's okay, we don't have to go out and stuff."
[00:14:51.660 --> 00:14:57.140]   But you know, you know that there's going to be some level of disappointment.
[00:14:57.140 --> 00:14:58.780]   They might say like, "It's all right.
[00:14:58.780 --> 00:15:01.060]   I don't have these huge expectations.
[00:15:01.060 --> 00:15:02.060]   We can just do whatever."
[00:15:02.060 --> 00:15:06.100]   But you know, I mean, you'd be lying if you said, "It's going to be fine.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:07.660]   I'm not going to do anything.
[00:15:07.660 --> 00:15:09.020]   I'm not going to get her anything.
[00:15:09.020 --> 00:15:10.020]   I'm not going to take her out anywhere.
[00:15:10.020 --> 00:15:14.180]   I'm just not going to do anything because she's going to be okay with it."
[00:15:14.180 --> 00:15:18.020]   Your conscience is not clear.
[00:15:18.020 --> 00:15:23.580]   The reason why I bring this up is because he makes this challenge.
[00:15:23.580 --> 00:15:24.580]   What's the...
[00:15:24.580 --> 00:15:27.580]   Did some of you guys do that?
[00:15:27.580 --> 00:15:30.420]   Why are you guys laughing?
[00:15:30.420 --> 00:15:34.060]   Your conscience needs to be informed.
[00:15:34.060 --> 00:15:39.660]   Because the way he's talking here is, it's not just a suffer.
[00:15:39.660 --> 00:15:42.020]   Suck it up, right?
[00:15:42.020 --> 00:15:48.620]   He's challenging us to be free, to have a conscience and awareness of God, and to suffer
[00:15:48.620 --> 00:15:55.140]   not just for anything, but for the right thing, and the right way, for the favor of God.
[00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:59.500]   Your conscience tells you when your wife or your significant other is not going to be
[00:15:59.500 --> 00:16:01.060]   pleased.
[00:16:01.060 --> 00:16:04.460]   If you don't have a sense of that, yeah, you're like dense, right?
[00:16:04.460 --> 00:16:05.460]   You have no...
[00:16:05.460 --> 00:16:06.460]   What do they call that?
[00:16:06.460 --> 00:16:07.460]   I forget what they call that.
[00:16:07.460 --> 00:16:09.300]   But anyway, yes, I'm thinking in Korean.
[00:16:09.300 --> 00:16:10.300]   I'm trying not to use the Korean.
[00:16:10.300 --> 00:16:14.380]   But you're just dull and dense, okay?
[00:16:14.380 --> 00:16:18.940]   If you don't have a sense of that, like, "My wife is not going to be pleased by this."
[00:16:18.940 --> 00:16:22.680]   But instead, we should have that sense with God, and when we suffer, those things should
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.380]   actually be active and working, even when we go through hard stuff, right?
[00:16:27.380 --> 00:16:29.380]   "This is to my God's good pleasure.
[00:16:29.380 --> 00:16:35.940]   I'm doing this as a free offering, almost, as a sacrifice to go through this kind of
[00:16:35.940 --> 00:16:36.940]   suffering."
[00:16:36.940 --> 00:16:40.300]   So, to just simply say, "Hey, you've been called to this purpose."
[00:16:40.300 --> 00:16:42.780]   Don't take that as like, "The Bible says suck it up, man.
[00:16:42.780 --> 00:16:43.780]   I just need to take it."
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:45.420]   Well, to some degree, yes.
[00:16:45.420 --> 00:16:49.780]   We need to be courageous and manly about, or like, you know, strong and bold about suffering.
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:51.460]   But that's not it.
[00:16:51.460 --> 00:16:55.740]   Again, right for the right reason, with the right attitude.
[00:16:55.740 --> 00:17:01.700]   And this is what we're going to talk about mainly today, is the attitude behind the suffering.
[00:17:01.700 --> 00:17:06.140]   Is the heart behind suffering that makes it such a challenge to us?
[00:17:06.140 --> 00:17:13.220]   Now, as an, like, that was like a kind of introductory way of getting into our study.
[00:17:13.220 --> 00:17:19.740]   Turn your Bibles to, sorry, Isaiah 53, verse 4 through 12.
[00:17:19.740 --> 00:17:24.500]   You're going to notice that as we read our passage, you're going to see so many corollary
[00:17:24.500 --> 00:17:30.260]   between Isaiah 53 and the passage that we're looking at tonight.
[00:17:30.260 --> 00:17:38.020]   So, and you guys are probably familiar with the chapter.
[00:17:38.020 --> 00:17:41.460]   It's the chapter on the suffering servant of God.
[00:17:41.460 --> 00:17:42.800]   Okay?
[00:17:42.800 --> 00:17:46.580]   I'm going to read from verse 3, actually, and go down to verse 12.
[00:17:46.580 --> 00:17:48.940]   It's a little bit longer, but let's read that.
[00:17:48.940 --> 00:17:53.540]   He says here, "He was despised and rejected by men, a man of sorrows, acquainted with
[00:17:53.540 --> 00:17:59.820]   grief, and as one from whom men hide their faces, he was despised and we esteemed him
[00:17:59.820 --> 00:18:00.820]   not.
[00:18:00.820 --> 00:18:09.060]   Surely, he has borne our griefs and carried our sorrows, yet we esteemed him stricken,
[00:18:09.060 --> 00:18:11.180]   smitten of God and afflicted.
[00:18:11.180 --> 00:18:15.020]   But he was pierced for our transgressions, he was crushed for our iniquities.
[00:18:15.020 --> 00:18:21.220]   Upon him was a chastisement that bought us peace, and with his wounds we are healed.
[00:18:21.220 --> 00:18:24.580]   All we like sheep have gone astray, we have turned everyone to his own way.
[00:18:24.580 --> 00:18:26.900]   The Lord has laid on him the iniquity of us all.
[00:18:26.900 --> 00:18:30.740]   He was oppressed and he was afflicted, yet he opened not his mouth.
[00:18:30.740 --> 00:18:34.660]   Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like a sheep that before its shears is
[00:18:34.660 --> 00:18:37.580]   silenced, so he opened not his mouth.
[00:18:37.580 --> 00:18:41.940]   By oppression and judgment he was taken away, and as for his generation, who considered
[00:18:41.940 --> 00:18:45.620]   that he was cut off out of the land of the living, stricken for the transgression of
[00:18:45.620 --> 00:18:47.240]   my people?
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:51.720]   And they made his grave with the wicked, and with the rich man is in his death.
[00:18:51.720 --> 00:18:56.400]   Although he had done no violence, and there was no deceit in his mouth, yet it was the
[00:18:56.400 --> 00:19:00.000]   will of the Lord to crush him.
[00:19:00.000 --> 00:19:03.640]   He has put him to grief when his soul makes an offering for guilt.
[00:19:03.640 --> 00:19:06.840]   He shall see his offspring, he shall prolong his days.
[00:19:06.840 --> 00:19:10.040]   The will of the Lord will prosper in his hand.
[00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.840]   Out of the anguish of his soul he shall see and be satisfied.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:18.640]   By his knowledge shall the righteous one, my servant, make many to be accounted righteous,
[00:19:18.640 --> 00:19:21.640]   and he shall bear their iniquities.
[00:19:21.640 --> 00:19:26.200]   Therefore, I will divide him a portion with the many, and he shall divide the spoiled
[00:19:26.200 --> 00:19:31.280]   with the strong, because he poured out his soul to death, and was numbered with the transgressors.
[00:19:31.280 --> 00:19:38.600]   Yet he bore the sin of many, and makes intercession for the transgressors.
[00:19:38.600 --> 00:19:42.960]   That passage is one that's quite amazing, and if we would then quickly jump back to
[00:19:42.960 --> 00:19:50.120]   our passage in 1 Peter, we're gonna read that section and see the corollary between them.
[00:19:50.120 --> 00:19:52.400]   So I'll read our verse again.
[00:19:52.400 --> 00:19:56.840]   Chapter 2, starting from verse 21 and down.
[00:19:56.840 --> 00:20:02.880]   For to this you have been called, because Christ also suffered for you, leaving you
[00:20:02.880 --> 00:20:07.120]   an example so that you might follow in his steps.
[00:20:07.120 --> 00:20:12.760]   He committed no sin, neither was deceit found in his mouth, yet he was reviled, he did not
[00:20:12.760 --> 00:20:14.360]   revile in return.
[00:20:14.360 --> 00:20:19.680]   When he suffered, he did not threaten, but continued entrusting himself to him who judges
[00:20:19.680 --> 00:20:20.760]   justly.
[00:20:20.760 --> 00:20:26.160]   He himself bore our sins in his body on that tree, that we might die to sin and live for
[00:20:26.160 --> 00:20:27.160]   righteousness.
[00:20:27.160 --> 00:20:32.640]   By his wound you have been healed, for you were straying like sheep, but have now returned
[00:20:32.640 --> 00:20:37.120]   to the shepherd and overseer of your soul.
[00:20:37.120 --> 00:20:38.120]   Pretty amazing, right?
[00:20:38.120 --> 00:20:40.400]   You see the corollary between the two.
[00:20:40.400 --> 00:20:46.080]   1 Peter is well versed in scripture, and in terms of the reason and rationale why you
[00:20:46.080 --> 00:20:50.640]   should subject yourself, why you should suffer for the right thing, and in the right way,
[00:20:50.640 --> 00:20:58.600]   he points to the Messiah, the suffering servant, and says, "Look how he suffered for you."
[00:20:58.600 --> 00:21:05.720]   This is his ultimate reason why we should learn to submit, why we should learn to surrender.
[00:21:05.720 --> 00:21:11.240]   Now, we talked about this a bit already, this purpose that we have, but I want to talk about
[00:21:11.240 --> 00:21:17.320]   this reason and rationale for our surrender and submission, when he says, "Christ suffered
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:22.960]   for you, leaving you an example so that you might follow in his steps."
[00:21:22.960 --> 00:21:29.840]   And I ask you to think about that a little bit.
[00:21:29.840 --> 00:21:31.400]   It's interesting.
[00:21:31.400 --> 00:21:41.400]   Theologically, can Christ's substitutionary atonement sacrifice be mimicked?
[00:21:41.400 --> 00:21:48.200]   Can his salvation suffering, as you could say, his sacrifice and his work of substitution
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:52.320]   for us, can that be mimicked by us?
[00:21:52.320 --> 00:21:56.480]   What are we actually supposed to be copying here?
[00:21:56.480 --> 00:21:58.480]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:21:58.480 --> 00:22:04.080]   When he says, "Christ suffered for you," and he says, "leaving you an example to follow,"
[00:22:04.080 --> 00:22:06.400]   what example is that?
[00:22:06.400 --> 00:22:09.480]   And then as we think about it a little bit more, I wonder if some people are thinking,
[00:22:09.480 --> 00:22:11.480]   "Man, this is strange.
[00:22:11.480 --> 00:22:12.480]   Really?
[00:22:12.480 --> 00:22:18.720]   I didn't expect this, because the idea of substitution is Christ takes care of it for
[00:22:18.720 --> 00:22:19.720]   me.
[00:22:19.720 --> 00:22:21.720]   I mean, I'm grateful."
[00:22:21.720 --> 00:22:27.360]   You know, if you guys have ever been in a dire situation, at a lost moment, where you're
[00:22:27.360 --> 00:22:31.640]   like, "Man, I can't do this," and you just need somebody to step in for you, and if someone
[00:22:31.640 --> 00:22:33.720]   does, it's like, "Oh, thank you."
[00:22:33.720 --> 00:22:37.120]   So you're thankful for that, but you knew you couldn't do it.
[00:22:37.120 --> 00:22:39.440]   So we think about the penalty for sin.
[00:22:39.440 --> 00:22:40.440]   Christ died for sin.
[00:22:40.440 --> 00:22:41.440]   I don't pay for sin.
[00:22:41.440 --> 00:22:46.000]   None of my works of righteousness, none of my suffering pays for sin.
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Christ does that.
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:53.120]   And yet, we still suffer and go through the consequences of sin.
[00:22:53.120 --> 00:22:57.200]   Christ died for sin in the sense that he's put an end to the bondage of sin, and yet
[00:22:57.200 --> 00:22:59.160]   as a Christian, I still sin.
[00:22:59.160 --> 00:23:00.160]   Right?
[00:23:00.160 --> 00:23:02.520]   There are other things.
[00:23:02.520 --> 00:23:04.680]   Christ conquers death, but we still die.
[00:23:04.680 --> 00:23:10.240]   Christ overcomes pain and sickness, yet we're still weak as men and women.
[00:23:10.240 --> 00:23:13.360]   What's more, the passage says, "He suffered on my behalf," but then he says, "But you
[00:23:13.360 --> 00:23:14.360]   still suffer."
[00:23:14.360 --> 00:23:18.360]   Why?
[00:23:18.360 --> 00:23:19.360]   Think about that for a moment.
[00:23:19.360 --> 00:23:20.360]   You know?
[00:23:20.360 --> 00:23:23.760]   And what I'd like you guys to do is take some time to discuss that.
[00:23:23.760 --> 00:23:26.320]   So I asked this two-part question.
[00:23:26.320 --> 00:23:31.440]   One is, what's the example that Christ set for us to follow?
[00:23:31.440 --> 00:23:37.200]   The second follow-up question is, why are we expected to follow that example when Christ,
[00:23:37.200 --> 00:23:40.560]   in substitution, was supposed to take care of it all?
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:41.560]   Okay?
[00:23:41.560 --> 00:23:42.560]   Go.
[00:23:42.560 --> 00:23:44.560]   I'll give you guys a couple minutes.
[00:23:44.560 --> 00:23:50.320]   Okay, so we'll bring it back together.
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:55.720]   Okay, so we asked the question, two-part question.
[00:23:55.720 --> 00:23:58.120]   What example are we supposed to follow?
[00:23:58.120 --> 00:24:00.800]   And why are we still expected to follow that example?
[00:24:00.800 --> 00:24:01.800]   You know?
[00:24:01.800 --> 00:24:06.320]   Do you guys, from your tables, anybody want to share some of the things you discussed?
[00:24:06.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   Yes.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   Our table said, "Suffering is justly."
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:11.320]   Okay.
[00:24:11.320 --> 00:24:22.320]   And you said, "The reasons are evangelism, obedience to God, Christ-prompted sanctification."
[00:24:22.320 --> 00:24:25.680]   Okay, excellent.
[00:24:25.680 --> 00:24:29.440]   Well, this covers it all.
[00:24:29.440 --> 00:24:30.440]   That's good.
[00:24:30.440 --> 00:24:31.680]   Thank you, James, for doing that.
[00:24:31.680 --> 00:24:32.680]   Let's think about that for a little bit.
[00:24:32.680 --> 00:24:33.680]   Okay.
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:34.680]   More.
[00:24:34.680 --> 00:24:35.680]   You want to share more?
[00:24:35.680 --> 00:24:36.680]   Yeah, God wants us to suffer as Christ because, in verse 20, he says, "God finds favor with
[00:24:36.680 --> 00:24:37.680]   God."
[00:24:37.680 --> 00:24:38.680]   So if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:38.680 --> 00:24:39.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:39.680 --> 00:24:40.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:40.680 --> 00:24:41.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:41.680 --> 00:24:42.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:42.680 --> 00:24:43.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:43.680 --> 00:24:44.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:44.680 --> 00:24:45.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:45.680 --> 00:24:52.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:52.680 --> 00:24:53.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:53.680 --> 00:24:54.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:55.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:55.680 --> 00:24:56.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:56.680 --> 00:24:57.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:24:58.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:24:58.680 --> 00:24:59.680]   favored by God.
[00:24:59.680 --> 00:25:00.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:25:00.680 --> 00:25:01.680]   favored by God.
[00:25:01.680 --> 00:25:02.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:25:02.680 --> 00:25:03.680]   favored by God.
[00:25:03.680 --> 00:25:04.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:25:04.680 --> 00:25:05.680]   favored by God.
[00:25:05.680 --> 00:25:26.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:25:26.680 --> 00:25:50.680]   favored by God.
[00:25:50.680 --> 00:25:57.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:25:57.680 --> 00:25:58.680]   favored by God.
[00:25:58.680 --> 00:25:59.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:25:59.680 --> 00:26:00.680]   favored by God.

[00:26:01.680 --> 00:26:02.680]   favored by God.
[00:26:02.680 --> 00:26:03.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:26:03.680 --> 00:26:04.680]   favored by God.
[00:26:04.680 --> 00:26:05.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   favored by God.
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:07.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:08.680]   favored by God.
[00:26:08.680 --> 00:26:09.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:26:09.680 --> 00:26:10.680]   favored by God.
[00:26:10.680 --> 00:26:31.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:26:31.680 --> 00:26:55.680]   favored by God.
[00:26:55.680 --> 00:27:21.680]   So, if we suffer as Christ under the same kind of situation, suffering is justly, we're
[00:27:21.680 --> 00:27:50.680]   favored by God.
[00:27:50.680 --> 00:27:53.100]   as one outside the law, not being outside the law of God,
[00:27:53.100 --> 00:27:54.460]   but under the law of Christ,
[00:27:54.460 --> 00:27:56.580]   that I might win those outside the law.
[00:27:56.580 --> 00:27:59.940]   To the weak I became weak that I might win the weak.
[00:27:59.940 --> 00:28:02.340]   I've become all things to all people,
[00:28:02.340 --> 00:28:05.100]   that by all means I might save some.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.420]   I do it all for the sake of the gospel
[00:28:07.420 --> 00:28:11.960]   that I may share with them in its blessing, right.
[00:28:11.960 --> 00:28:15.300]   As you think about this passage,
[00:28:15.300 --> 00:28:17.260]   this question of oh, why are we supposed
[00:28:17.260 --> 00:28:20.140]   to follow his example, because maybe
[00:28:20.140 --> 00:28:21.900]   we have this preconceived notion
[00:28:21.900 --> 00:28:24.420]   that by the salvation now I'm afforded
[00:28:24.420 --> 00:28:26.700]   peace from all suffering.
[00:28:26.700 --> 00:28:28.460]   Let's completely scrap that notion
[00:28:28.460 --> 00:28:29.980]   and say what we've been afforded
[00:28:29.980 --> 00:28:33.100]   is a calling into his kingdom as his servants.
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.060]   He says you are a royal nation,
[00:28:35.060 --> 00:28:37.500]   you're a royal priesthood, you're kingdom priests,
[00:28:37.500 --> 00:28:39.300]   and he says I expect you to proclaim
[00:28:39.300 --> 00:28:44.300]   the excellencies of him who called you, right.
[00:28:44.300 --> 00:28:46.940]   There's an incredible purpose of servanthood
[00:28:46.940 --> 00:28:49.380]   that God has called us to, and a main reason
[00:28:49.380 --> 00:28:52.120]   why he's left us here is to follow
[00:28:52.120 --> 00:28:53.820]   the footsteps of our savior.
[00:28:53.820 --> 00:28:55.620]   This is an example that he's laid.
[00:28:55.620 --> 00:28:56.940]   The scripture says in the passage
[00:28:56.940 --> 00:28:58.820]   that we've been reading that he laid
[00:28:58.820 --> 00:29:02.220]   this example for us to follow in his steps.
[00:29:02.220 --> 00:29:05.660]   What's really vivid about that is the Greek says,
[00:29:05.660 --> 00:29:07.900]   when it says to follow that example,
[00:29:07.900 --> 00:29:09.980]   it's like placing a thin piece of paper
[00:29:09.980 --> 00:29:12.460]   on a drawing and tracing it.
[00:29:12.460 --> 00:29:17.180]   God expects us to trace our savior's footsteps,
[00:29:17.180 --> 00:29:18.940]   trace our savior's heart.
[00:29:19.780 --> 00:29:21.620]   If we're gonna suffer for anything,
[00:29:21.620 --> 00:29:24.900]   suffer for the sake of sharing the gospel
[00:29:24.900 --> 00:29:26.840]   that some might be saved.
[00:29:26.840 --> 00:29:29.980]   And if in terms of attitude that we're suffering,
[00:29:29.980 --> 00:29:32.140]   we're all of a sudden all bittered,
[00:29:32.140 --> 00:29:37.020]   if we're all resentful, how are we going
[00:29:37.020 --> 00:29:38.820]   to make that an opportunity to show
[00:29:38.820 --> 00:29:41.220]   the character of God, right?
[00:29:41.220 --> 00:29:45.300]   And so he says this is the kind of thing
[00:29:45.300 --> 00:29:46.700]   that you want to sign up for,
[00:29:46.700 --> 00:29:48.700]   this is the kind of purpose that you're to have,
[00:29:48.700 --> 00:29:50.740]   this is the kind of vision and conviction
[00:29:50.740 --> 00:29:53.700]   that you want to make sure you're redeeming
[00:29:53.700 --> 00:29:56.940]   that moment of suffering and difficulty in your life.
[00:29:56.940 --> 00:30:01.700]   So I want to highlight that more by the next question.
[00:30:01.700 --> 00:30:03.140]   On your packet I ask this question,
[00:30:03.140 --> 00:30:05.860]   he says, what has he suffered?
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.820]   Well when we take a look at our passage,
[00:30:08.820 --> 00:30:17.780]   verse 22, he describes, he committed no sin,
[00:30:18.140 --> 00:30:20.900]   neither was deceit found in his mouth.
[00:30:20.900 --> 00:30:23.740]   When he was reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:30:23.740 --> 00:30:25.340]   When he suffered, he did not threaten,
[00:30:25.340 --> 00:30:27.420]   but continued entrusting himself
[00:30:27.420 --> 00:30:30.780]   to him who judges justly, right?
[00:30:30.780 --> 00:30:33.700]   Well I want to highlight two things from that.
[00:30:33.700 --> 00:30:35.820]   In terms of what he suffered,
[00:30:35.820 --> 00:30:38.660]   it's clear he suffered unjustly.
[00:30:38.660 --> 00:30:43.660]   So for letter A, please just write complete injustice, okay?
[00:30:43.660 --> 00:30:47.020]   Now if you guys have ever been accused
[00:30:47.020 --> 00:30:48.780]   of something you have not done,
[00:30:48.780 --> 00:30:50.020]   you guys know how it feels,
[00:30:50.020 --> 00:30:51.660]   that like burning sensation in you
[00:30:51.660 --> 00:30:56.140]   where you want to justify, defend, right?
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:31:01.140]   Make clear, like, there's this kind of feeling of like,
[00:31:01.140 --> 00:31:04.140]   man you better recognize, you know?
[00:31:04.140 --> 00:31:06.420]   When people have the misconception of you,
[00:31:06.420 --> 00:31:09.900]   when people, you know, falsely accuse you,
[00:31:09.900 --> 00:31:12.300]   we want to immediately retaliate.
[00:31:12.300 --> 00:31:13.660]   But the fact of the matter is,
[00:31:13.660 --> 00:31:16.540]   Christ was accused, he was tried,
[00:31:16.540 --> 00:31:19.860]   he was blasphemed and slandered as a criminal.
[00:31:19.860 --> 00:31:23.700]   And what makes it worse is that he was the purest,
[00:31:23.700 --> 00:31:28.140]   most sinless, most innocent person ever, right?
[00:31:28.140 --> 00:31:30.100]   For us, even if we defend ourselves,
[00:31:30.100 --> 00:31:32.220]   it's like there's a part of us that's like,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:34.820]   oh, but sometimes I do that, you know what I mean?
[00:31:34.820 --> 00:31:36.060]   There isn't a pure sense of,
[00:31:36.060 --> 00:31:39.420]   yeah, am I really gonna go out and defend myself?
[00:31:39.420 --> 00:31:40.860]   But for Christ, he could have.
[00:31:41.940 --> 00:31:43.020]   The fact of the matter is,
[00:31:43.020 --> 00:31:46.340]   he experienced the greatest injustice of all time.
[00:31:46.340 --> 00:31:49.840]   But, this is what I want to highlight.
[00:31:49.840 --> 00:31:51.780]   The second part of that,
[00:31:51.780 --> 00:31:53.220]   when he starts talking in that verse
[00:31:53.220 --> 00:31:56.180]   about when he was reviled and he did not revile in return,
[00:31:56.180 --> 00:31:58.420]   when he suffered, he did not threaten,
[00:31:58.420 --> 00:32:02.380]   but continued entrusting himself to him who judges justly,
[00:32:02.380 --> 00:32:03.540]   and in verse 24 it says,
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.300]   he himself bore our sins in his body on the tree
[00:32:07.300 --> 00:32:10.860]   that we might die to sins and live to righteousness.
[00:32:10.860 --> 00:32:14.220]   By his wounds, you have been healed.
[00:32:14.220 --> 00:32:18.460]   I want to talk about not just simply
[00:32:18.460 --> 00:32:21.140]   suffering for injustice,
[00:32:21.140 --> 00:32:23.580]   but the next part, complete servanthood.
[00:32:23.580 --> 00:32:28.940]   There is an injustice you experience
[00:32:28.940 --> 00:32:30.980]   as people who are malicious around you.
[00:32:30.980 --> 00:32:35.260]   There is a suffering under that.
[00:32:35.260 --> 00:32:38.380]   But then there is a suffering where it's all volitional.
[00:32:39.500 --> 00:32:43.420]   There is a suffering where you go into it
[00:32:43.420 --> 00:32:45.660]   knowing this is gonna happen.
[00:32:45.660 --> 00:32:48.100]   Where because you care for somebody,
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.460]   you are willing to take responsibility,
[00:32:50.460 --> 00:32:52.700]   you're willing to take liability,
[00:32:52.700 --> 00:32:54.780]   you're willing to take burden.
[00:32:54.780 --> 00:32:59.620]   When we read that passage in Isaiah 53,
[00:32:59.620 --> 00:33:03.580]   you saw how many times it used the word bore.
[00:33:03.580 --> 00:33:07.100]   He bore our sins, he bore our wounds.
[00:33:07.100 --> 00:33:10.420]   In this passage the same, he is repeating this idea
[00:33:10.420 --> 00:33:14.780]   that Christ took upon, there is that theme of substitution.
[00:33:14.780 --> 00:33:19.780]   He himself bore the sins on his body on that cross.
[00:33:19.780 --> 00:33:23.700]   He bore the penalty, he bore the consequences,
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.260]   and there's a sense where one might think
[00:33:27.260 --> 00:33:29.700]   to the people who are suffering in that time,
[00:33:29.700 --> 00:33:35.860]   they have to recognize if they didn't have Christ,
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:38.220]   they would have suffered even greater pain
[00:33:38.220 --> 00:33:42.300]   by the wrath of God for the punishment of sin.
[00:33:42.300 --> 00:33:46.340]   If they're wanting to avoid pain,
[00:33:46.340 --> 00:33:48.220]   there was an incredible amount of pain to come
[00:33:48.220 --> 00:33:50.980]   that they've already dodged
[00:33:50.980 --> 00:33:54.140]   by the safety that's afforded to them in Christ.
[00:33:54.140 --> 00:33:57.620]   This is the kind of love, this is the kind of servanthood
[00:33:57.620 --> 00:34:00.620]   that Christ desires us to follow in his steps,
[00:34:00.620 --> 00:34:03.180]   to trace in terms of what he suffered.
[00:34:03.180 --> 00:34:05.980]   It's not just a matter of being able to face injustice
[00:34:05.980 --> 00:34:08.620]   with a straight face and say, that's okay, no.
[00:34:08.620 --> 00:34:10.500]   He wants us to have a hard attitude
[00:34:10.500 --> 00:34:13.500]   where we have an attitude of servanthood,
[00:34:13.500 --> 00:34:14.740]   where just like the Apostle Paul,
[00:34:14.740 --> 00:34:17.420]   we're willing to take the burden of others
[00:34:17.420 --> 00:34:19.940]   upon our shoulders.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:22.460]   That is an attitude far beyond this world.
[00:34:22.460 --> 00:34:26.500]   You know, just to appreciate this,
[00:34:26.500 --> 00:34:28.060]   I was kind of thinking, what's recently
[00:34:28.060 --> 00:34:32.500]   one of the greater scenes of self-sacrifice that I've seen?
[00:34:32.500 --> 00:34:35.140]   I watched that movie, Guardians of the Galaxy,
[00:34:35.140 --> 00:34:37.780]   kind of late, so I watched it not too long ago.
[00:34:37.780 --> 00:34:41.260]   I'm not sure if you guys have seen that movie.
[00:34:41.260 --> 00:34:43.180]   It's one of these kind of light-hearted,
[00:34:43.180 --> 00:34:44.560]   just action movies.
[00:34:44.560 --> 00:34:47.260]   Some of it's kind of cute, too.
[00:34:47.260 --> 00:34:50.740]   Well, there's this scene near the end.
[00:34:50.740 --> 00:34:53.180]   There's a crazy villain that seems so powerful
[00:34:53.180 --> 00:34:54.460]   that he's gonna destroy everything.
[00:34:54.460 --> 00:34:56.500]   He's gonna destroy worlds.
[00:34:56.500 --> 00:34:59.900]   And he comes down in this weird, twisty hunk of metal
[00:34:59.900 --> 00:35:03.140]   on a ship that looks like a ginormous cinnamon twist.
[00:35:03.140 --> 00:35:06.700]   And he has these, you guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:35:06.700 --> 00:35:10.020]   He's got these drones that are coming down, you know?
[00:35:10.020 --> 00:35:12.620]   And out of desperation, they're all fighting him,
[00:35:12.620 --> 00:35:14.220]   but they're all getting beat up.
[00:35:14.220 --> 00:35:16.780]   And that little raccoon, or whatever he is,
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:18.420]   jackal, I don't know, he takes the ship
[00:35:18.420 --> 00:35:22.060]   and he runs it into the helm,
[00:35:22.060 --> 00:35:23.980]   and then he knocks him over.
[00:35:23.980 --> 00:35:27.180]   And at some point, everybody's hurt and wounded.
[00:35:27.180 --> 00:35:28.780]   You guys remember that scene?
[00:35:28.780 --> 00:35:30.180]   The little raccoon's all hurt,
[00:35:30.180 --> 00:35:32.180]   and then the buff guy's all hurt and down,
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:34.180]   and they're all huddled together.
[00:35:34.180 --> 00:35:35.580]   And then Groot, all of a sudden,
[00:35:35.580 --> 00:35:36.940]   Groot's the wooden figure.
[00:35:36.940 --> 00:35:40.140]   He's the one who all he says is, "Groot," right?
[00:35:40.140 --> 00:35:42.300]   All of a sudden, Groot starts to grow.
[00:35:42.300 --> 00:35:45.260]   He's like, "Blah, grrr."
[00:35:45.260 --> 00:35:47.060]   And he grows into this ginormous ball,
[00:35:47.060 --> 00:35:49.180]   and he encapsulates his friends.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:50.940]   And little raccoon starts crying.
[00:35:50.940 --> 00:35:52.820]   He's like, "Why, Groot?
[00:35:52.820 --> 00:35:54.020]   "Why?"
[00:35:54.020 --> 00:35:57.220]   And then Groot goes, "We are Groot."
[00:35:57.220 --> 00:35:58.700]   (audience laughing)
[00:35:58.700 --> 00:36:01.380]   And he has this solidarity with the group,
[00:36:01.380 --> 00:36:03.540]   and he feels them, you know?
[00:36:03.540 --> 00:36:04.900]   And he starts like wrapping them,
[00:36:04.900 --> 00:36:07.420]   and then as they fall, it's just like this blaze of light,
[00:36:07.420 --> 00:36:08.820]   and it's like, "Blah!"
[00:36:08.820 --> 00:36:10.100]   And then he's destroyed.
[00:36:10.100 --> 00:36:14.060]   Wow, what self-sacrifice.
[00:36:14.060 --> 00:36:16.660]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:16.660 --> 00:36:19.980]   But I almost wondered whether I should share
[00:36:19.980 --> 00:36:24.020]   this example or not, because although that was really moving
[00:36:24.020 --> 00:36:26.420]   and touching, the tear that the raccoon was shedding
[00:36:26.420 --> 00:36:28.540]   and everything, it pales in comparison
[00:36:28.540 --> 00:36:29.940]   to what our Savior has done.
[00:36:29.940 --> 00:36:32.420]   Why?
[00:36:32.420 --> 00:36:35.220]   They end up having to fight the bad guy after anyway.
[00:36:35.220 --> 00:36:38.060]   (audience laughing)
[00:36:38.060 --> 00:36:39.140]   Why?
[00:36:39.140 --> 00:36:41.620]   Because in terms of what Christ has done for us,
[00:36:41.620 --> 00:36:44.420]   there is absolutely no comparison.
[00:36:44.420 --> 00:36:45.900]   Does Groot change who they are?
[00:36:45.900 --> 00:36:47.700]   No, when Christ suffers for us,
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:50.980]   he completely not only allows us to escape the wrath,
[00:36:50.980 --> 00:36:52.460]   he changes us by nature.
[00:36:52.460 --> 00:36:54.100]   He transforms us.
[00:36:55.220 --> 00:36:57.340]   I don't know what earthly comparison there is
[00:36:57.340 --> 00:37:00.540]   for the kind of sacrifice Christ has done.
[00:37:00.540 --> 00:37:03.220]   Christ says in Scripture, "There is no kind of love
[00:37:03.220 --> 00:37:06.660]   "like a friend who has laid down his life for a brother."
[00:37:06.660 --> 00:37:07.900]   Well, the fact of the matter is,
[00:37:07.900 --> 00:37:12.460]   Christ is the epitome of that sacrifice, right?
[00:37:12.460 --> 00:37:15.060]   He is the epitome of that heart
[00:37:15.060 --> 00:37:17.220]   that lends himself to being so generous,
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:19.300]   he would lay down his everything,
[00:37:19.300 --> 00:37:23.100]   or he would empty to a degree
[00:37:23.100 --> 00:37:24.500]   which we will never fathom.
[00:37:24.500 --> 00:37:26.180]   We will never get it.
[00:37:26.180 --> 00:37:28.460]   We will never understand the depth of his sacrifice.
[00:37:28.460 --> 00:37:31.980]   We will never understand how far he had to come down.
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.540]   We will never understand the depth
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:36.300]   from which he has brought us up through the sacrifice.
[00:37:36.300 --> 00:37:38.340]   We will never understand the magnitude
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:43.340]   of the pain he had to experience for our salvation, right?
[00:37:43.340 --> 00:37:46.860]   This is what Christ has done for us.
[00:37:46.860 --> 00:37:51.540]   And so, I say again, for the people who are around us,
[00:37:51.540 --> 00:37:53.460]   when we think about what we're doing right now
[00:37:53.460 --> 00:37:56.020]   and the experiences that we have,
[00:37:56.020 --> 00:37:58.780]   we have to make sure we're trying to get into this mode
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.580]   and zone like Christ.
[00:38:00.580 --> 00:38:02.660]   We might be suffering,
[00:38:02.660 --> 00:38:04.020]   we might be going through difficult times
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:05.820]   and be like, "Ah, why?"
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:08.540]   But we have to redeem those moments.
[00:38:08.540 --> 00:38:11.740]   Let these moments be suffering for the glory of God.
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.460]   Let these moments be suffering for the redemption
[00:38:14.460 --> 00:38:17.260]   and salvation of the lost, you know?
[00:38:17.260 --> 00:38:20.140]   If you are experiencing hardship at work, school,
[00:38:20.140 --> 00:38:22.500]   whatever it is, home,
[00:38:22.500 --> 00:38:26.620]   let these moments to be to the glory of our Savior, amen?
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:31.700]   Now, we wanna get to the next part
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.020]   because this is the part that's going to really continue
[00:38:34.020 --> 00:38:35.500]   to challenge our hearts.
[00:38:35.500 --> 00:38:40.260]   Because we see the heart of our Savior,
[00:38:40.260 --> 00:38:43.020]   we understand that he suffered in such a different way.
[00:38:43.020 --> 00:38:47.900]   Apostle Peter saw all of it.
[00:38:47.900 --> 00:38:49.700]   He saw how Christ suffered,
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.100]   and what's more, he experienced firsthand
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:54.900]   how perhaps the fellow believers, when they suffered,
[00:38:54.900 --> 00:38:57.340]   the temptation they would have
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:39:00.220]   to whether it be retaliate, to avoid the suffering,
[00:39:00.220 --> 00:39:01.460]   to run away and hide.
[00:39:01.460 --> 00:39:05.500]   Apostle Peter went through the full gamut experience.
[00:39:05.500 --> 00:39:08.700]   And what he does is he points to the Savior that he saw.
[00:39:08.700 --> 00:39:10.420]   And he talks about the different ways
[00:39:10.420 --> 00:39:11.660]   by which the Savior suffered
[00:39:11.660 --> 00:39:15.020]   that so challenges the way we suffer.
[00:39:15.020 --> 00:39:17.020]   Let's run down this list.
[00:39:17.020 --> 00:39:21.420]   Letter A, Christ, when he suffered, he did not sin.
[00:39:22.420 --> 00:39:23.780]   He did not sin.
[00:39:23.780 --> 00:39:26.300]   Sorry.
[00:39:26.300 --> 00:39:29.420]   When paralleling Isaiah 53 verse nine,
[00:39:29.420 --> 00:39:31.900]   the scripture says he committed no sin,
[00:39:31.900 --> 00:39:36.060]   nor was there any deceit found in his mouth.
[00:39:36.060 --> 00:39:38.780]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:39:38.780 --> 00:39:41.020]   When you feel wronged, when you feel a sense
[00:39:41.020 --> 00:39:44.180]   of like somebody just dissed you,
[00:39:44.180 --> 00:39:47.020]   typically the first way we sin is through our mouth.
[00:39:47.020 --> 00:39:49.740]   Whether it's we curse them, whether it's we go off,
[00:39:49.740 --> 00:39:52.380]   whether it's we revent, typically the way
[00:39:52.380 --> 00:39:54.940]   that we sin is through our words, right?
[00:39:54.940 --> 00:40:01.180]   What restraint, what strength our Savior exhibited,
[00:40:01.180 --> 00:40:05.380]   he did not slander in return, nor was there any deceit.
[00:40:05.380 --> 00:40:08.620]   There was no hint of trying to dodge the situation by lying.
[00:40:08.620 --> 00:40:10.340]   There was no hint of, you know,
[00:40:10.340 --> 00:40:12.740]   like making the truth all muddy and saying,
[00:40:12.740 --> 00:40:14.300]   oh, that's not kind of what I said.
[00:40:14.300 --> 00:40:16.420]   I didn't really say I was like the son, son of God.
[00:40:16.420 --> 00:40:17.500]   We're all sons of God.
[00:40:17.500 --> 00:40:22.500]   He did not have any kind of dodging the truth and reality.
[00:40:22.500 --> 00:40:25.460]   There was no deceit in his mouth.
[00:40:25.460 --> 00:40:26.500]   Let her be.
[00:40:26.500 --> 00:40:27.660]   He did not retaliate.
[00:40:27.660 --> 00:40:32.340]   While being reviled, he did not revile in return.
[00:40:32.340 --> 00:40:35.540]   While suffering, he uttered no threats.
[00:40:35.540 --> 00:40:38.220]   You think about that kind of, that's the kind of scene,
[00:40:38.220 --> 00:40:41.180]   again, the kind of strength that Christ had to exhibit
[00:40:41.180 --> 00:40:44.580]   to hold and maintain his composure and character
[00:40:44.580 --> 00:40:46.260]   underneath all that pressure.
[00:40:46.260 --> 00:40:48.460]   You know, it's one thing to kind of go through
[00:40:48.460 --> 00:40:51.140]   those injustices, it's another thing to be the object
[00:40:51.140 --> 00:40:54.060]   and the focal point of everyone's testing.
[00:40:54.060 --> 00:40:55.260]   The lawyers came by and was like,
[00:40:55.260 --> 00:40:57.260]   hey, what do you say when this happens?
[00:40:57.260 --> 00:40:58.700]   And what do you say according to this law?
[00:40:58.700 --> 00:41:01.000]   And you know they were trying to set him a trap.
[00:41:01.000 --> 00:41:02.620]   They were trying to push his buttons.
[00:41:02.620 --> 00:41:04.440]   They were trying to test his disciples.
[00:41:04.440 --> 00:41:07.140]   They were trying to push him to the point of breaking.
[00:41:07.140 --> 00:41:11.340]   Where maybe Christ would have been like, forget it!
[00:41:11.340 --> 00:41:13.580]   Just bring the cross over here, I'm gonna kill you all,
[00:41:13.580 --> 00:41:16.980]   I'm just gonna go to the crossing, night over with, you know?
[00:41:16.980 --> 00:41:20.380]   And that idea of, you know, like, maybe, just maybe,
[00:41:20.380 --> 00:41:22.020]   when Christ was angry or something,
[00:41:22.020 --> 00:41:23.420]   that he would have just lashed out and said,
[00:41:23.420 --> 00:41:24.980]   you know who I am?
[00:41:24.980 --> 00:41:26.980]   Let me show you who I am.
[00:41:26.980 --> 00:41:29.140]   And then, poof, you know?
[00:41:29.140 --> 00:41:32.540]   Made everybody's knees break and all their legs be broken
[00:41:32.540 --> 00:41:35.340]   and everybody just bowed down on their faces or something.
[00:41:35.340 --> 00:41:37.100]   But Christ did not.
[00:41:37.100 --> 00:41:40.360]   I wanna, you know, challenge you guys
[00:41:40.360 --> 00:41:41.620]   with this idea of strength.
[00:41:41.620 --> 00:41:44.540]   There are times when you sometimes get into, like,
[00:41:44.540 --> 00:41:46.500]   a fight or conflict with people,
[00:41:46.500 --> 00:41:48.300]   and there's this deception in your mind
[00:41:48.300 --> 00:41:51.360]   where you think strength means to overpower them.
[00:41:51.360 --> 00:41:53.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.000]   Strength means to have the last word.
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:41:57.420]   Strength means to win.
[00:41:57.420 --> 00:42:01.380]   Now, there are moments when we need to hold our ground,
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:03.300]   when we need to say what we need to say
[00:42:03.300 --> 00:42:05.460]   and do what we need to do.
[00:42:05.460 --> 00:42:07.160]   But in these moments when Christ knew
[00:42:07.160 --> 00:42:09.460]   that his purpose was to come and suffer,
[00:42:09.460 --> 00:42:12.140]   and that through his suffering we would be healed,
[00:42:12.140 --> 00:42:14.180]   Christ exhibited such a strength
[00:42:14.180 --> 00:42:17.140]   where although he had the power to quiet storms,
[00:42:17.140 --> 00:42:21.180]   he did not exert that power to quiet these foes.
[00:42:21.180 --> 00:42:25.300]   Why did our Savior, who had so much power, right,
[00:42:25.300 --> 00:42:28.420]   have to go through this kind of abuse?
[00:42:28.420 --> 00:42:30.780]   He was exhibiting a kind of strength
[00:42:30.780 --> 00:42:34.020]   where he had the power to forgive them.
[00:42:34.020 --> 00:42:37.640]   Remember that rather than just annihilating them,
[00:42:37.640 --> 00:42:39.840]   he asked of his Father,
[00:42:39.840 --> 00:42:42.960]   Father, forgive them for they do not know what they do.
[00:42:42.960 --> 00:42:46.220]   That is a strength beyond what we understand
[00:42:46.220 --> 00:42:47.620]   on the flesh side.
[00:42:47.620 --> 00:42:50.060]   On the flesh side, we understand power and might
[00:42:50.060 --> 00:42:52.860]   and the power of our hands and fists and our intellect.
[00:42:52.860 --> 00:42:55.980]   But there's a power in Christ
[00:42:55.980 --> 00:42:58.860]   where he completely overcomes that situation
[00:42:58.860 --> 00:43:03.580]   with grace, control, and absolute certainty in God.
[00:43:04.620 --> 00:43:08.520]   And so letter D, he goes through his suffering
[00:43:08.520 --> 00:43:10.240]   by trusting the Father.
[00:43:10.240 --> 00:43:11.440]   He's trusted the Father.
[00:43:11.440 --> 00:43:14.600]   The scripture says
[00:43:14.600 --> 00:43:23.320]   in verse 23 that he continued in trusting himself
[00:43:23.320 --> 00:43:26.220]   to him who judges justly.
[00:43:26.220 --> 00:43:29.880]   He drew his strength from the Father
[00:43:29.880 --> 00:43:31.680]   and ultimately drew his strength from knowing
[00:43:31.680 --> 00:43:36.260]   that the Father would judge according to his character.
[00:43:36.260 --> 00:43:38.380]   And what's really crazy about this idea of entrusting
[00:43:38.380 --> 00:43:40.260]   is that the Greek term is quite vivid
[00:43:40.260 --> 00:43:42.640]   where the term is to hand over something.
[00:43:42.640 --> 00:43:46.700]   When you commit something to somebody and say,
[00:43:46.700 --> 00:43:48.180]   hey, I'm gonna put it in the bank,
[00:43:48.180 --> 00:43:50.120]   I'm gonna put it under your care,
[00:43:50.120 --> 00:43:52.680]   that's the whole idea of entrusting.
[00:43:52.680 --> 00:43:56.020]   That when Jesus entrusted himself over everything
[00:43:56.020 --> 00:43:59.260]   about the situation, the outcome, whatever it may be,
[00:43:59.260 --> 00:44:02.740]   he entrusted over to the Father to the degree,
[00:44:02.740 --> 00:44:05.340]   remember in Luke chapter 23, sorry, yeah,
[00:44:05.340 --> 00:44:08.960]   Luke chapter 23, on his death at the cross,
[00:44:08.960 --> 00:44:12.980]   he said, Father, into your hands I commit my spirit.
[00:44:12.980 --> 00:44:15.340]   It's the same word used there.
[00:44:15.340 --> 00:44:19.580]   Guys, this is different from let go and let God.
[00:44:19.580 --> 00:44:22.140]   This is different from like, hey, you know,
[00:44:22.140 --> 00:44:24.420]   just trust and it'll happen.
[00:44:24.420 --> 00:44:26.700]   Just wait and see.
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:27.800]   How is that different?
[00:44:29.060 --> 00:44:30.940]   Because when you are truly trusting,
[00:44:30.940 --> 00:44:35.180]   you are completely relinquishing your will
[00:44:35.180 --> 00:44:37.700]   and your expectation to that of the Father
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:41.060]   knowing it's in good hands.
[00:44:41.060 --> 00:44:44.260]   You see, this whole modern concept of let go and let God
[00:44:44.260 --> 00:44:47.420]   to me just sounds like he'll still give you what you want.
[00:44:47.420 --> 00:44:49.780]   A lot of it is just wishful anticipation.
[00:44:49.780 --> 00:44:51.620]   I'm trying so hard to get what I want,
[00:44:51.620 --> 00:44:54.740]   but if I just get out of the way, God will do it for me.
[00:44:54.740 --> 00:44:55.580]   No.
[00:44:55.580 --> 00:44:58.900]   When you really are entrusting yourself,
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:02.660]   you're relinquishing your will, your tight-fistedness,
[00:45:02.660 --> 00:45:05.540]   and your conviction and commitment
[00:45:05.540 --> 00:45:06.900]   to still get what you want,
[00:45:06.900 --> 00:45:10.060]   and allowing all the outcome,
[00:45:10.060 --> 00:45:12.200]   allowing all the process,
[00:45:12.200 --> 00:45:15.740]   and every result that you expect to be in the hands of God.
[00:45:15.740 --> 00:45:18.180]   'Cause you know what?
[00:45:18.180 --> 00:45:20.580]   He's going to do justly.
[00:45:20.580 --> 00:45:22.260]   He's going to be your great shepherd.
[00:45:22.260 --> 00:45:24.260]   He's going to be your great guardian.
[00:45:24.260 --> 00:45:26.700]   He is the one who's going to cover over you.
[00:45:28.300 --> 00:45:31.700]   And so no matter what sad situation you find yourself in,
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:33.300]   you know that you can trust him.
[00:45:33.300 --> 00:45:37.340]   So what an encouragement to those who are suffering.
[00:45:37.340 --> 00:45:38.860]   You know, we kind of draw back to the idea
[00:45:38.860 --> 00:45:42.740]   that Apostle Peter is talking to those who are suffering
[00:45:42.740 --> 00:45:46.380]   in situations and circumstances that really, again,
[00:45:46.380 --> 00:45:50.300]   are dire moments that maybe we can't relate to as much,
[00:45:50.300 --> 00:45:53.980]   but still, nonetheless, we have this challenge for us
[00:45:53.980 --> 00:45:57.880]   to adopt the expectation of our Savior,
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   to adopt the kind of experiences that our Savior had,
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:04.980]   and what's more, to go through these experiences
[00:46:04.980 --> 00:46:06.860]   with the same attitude,
[00:46:06.860 --> 00:46:10.500]   with the same perspective that our Savior exhibited.
[00:46:10.500 --> 00:46:12.420]   And I give you this conclusion, again,
[00:46:12.420 --> 00:46:14.340]   by way of challenge.
[00:46:14.340 --> 00:46:16.900]   The chief reason, right,
[00:46:16.900 --> 00:46:19.940]   why God has allowed us to have these opportunities
[00:46:19.940 --> 00:46:21.140]   and time here,
[00:46:21.140 --> 00:46:24.700]   is that in God's timetable,
[00:46:24.700 --> 00:46:28.840]   God has given by grace and patience,
[00:46:28.840 --> 00:46:32.160]   opportunity for people to be saved.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:36.000]   And for those of us who are thinking,
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:38.120]   maybe if you're suffering now and just wondering,
[00:46:38.120 --> 00:46:39.920]   why doesn't God just end it now?
[00:46:39.920 --> 00:46:42.080]   Why doesn't he just take me now?
[00:46:42.080 --> 00:46:45.040]   Think about this.
[00:46:45.040 --> 00:46:49.280]   The way you have come to this point in your salvation
[00:46:49.280 --> 00:46:51.320]   is that there were beautiful feet before you
[00:46:51.320 --> 00:46:54.400]   who had gone to many lengths, many measures,
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:46:59.400]   and perhaps many sacrifices for you to hear the truth.
[00:46:59.400 --> 00:47:03.960]   Likewise, this is the truth we're supposed to carry.
[00:47:03.960 --> 00:47:05.220]   Right?
[00:47:05.220 --> 00:47:07.280]   This is the truth we're supposed to be willing
[00:47:07.280 --> 00:47:10.160]   to sacrifice for, and to care so deeply,
[00:47:10.160 --> 00:47:13.000]   and to ache for those who do not have it,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.640]   that from this point until we die,
[00:47:15.640 --> 00:47:19.280]   we're more than willing to sign up
[00:47:19.280 --> 00:47:21.520]   for whatever experiences may come,
[00:47:21.520 --> 00:47:23.480]   that those might be saved.
[00:47:23.480 --> 00:47:24.320]   Amen?
[00:47:24.520 --> 00:47:25.360]   Let's pray.
[00:47:25.360 --> 00:47:33.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for the challenge tonight.
[00:47:33.000 --> 00:47:35.920]   And first, we wanna thank you, Lord.
[00:47:35.920 --> 00:47:37.940]   God, we thank you that although our lives
[00:47:37.940 --> 00:47:39.720]   are so riddled with sin,
[00:47:39.720 --> 00:47:44.160]   you look upon us with such mercy and grace.
[00:47:44.160 --> 00:47:47.340]   And God, that not only do you look upon us,
[00:47:47.340 --> 00:47:50.040]   but you have taken such initiative and care
[00:47:50.040 --> 00:47:54.400]   to provide for all that we need for our salvation.
[00:47:54.400 --> 00:47:57.080]   We thank you, Father, and we also thank you
[00:47:57.080 --> 00:48:01.600]   for the privilege to be called to labor in your kingdom.
[00:48:01.600 --> 00:48:03.560]   And I ask that for all of us,
[00:48:03.560 --> 00:48:06.280]   we would buy into this conviction
[00:48:06.280 --> 00:48:08.160]   that in this generation is the time
[00:48:08.160 --> 00:48:10.040]   for your kingdom to advance,
[00:48:10.040 --> 00:48:12.760]   that you have called us to be soldiers in your kingdom,
[00:48:12.760 --> 00:48:15.480]   for the priest and servants in your kingdom,
[00:48:15.480 --> 00:48:18.760]   to serve the needs of those who you have called.
[00:48:18.760 --> 00:48:20.920]   And I pray, Father God, that this conviction
[00:48:20.920 --> 00:48:24.100]   would lead all of us, every single one of us,
[00:48:24.100 --> 00:48:26.040]   no matter where we stand.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:28.360]   Father, we wanna thank you again for your truth
[00:48:28.360 --> 00:48:30.880]   and your spirit that protects and guides us.
[00:48:30.880 --> 00:48:34.000]   I pray, Father God, that you continue to grant us faith
[00:48:34.000 --> 00:48:35.840]   as we experience the full gamut of things
[00:48:35.840 --> 00:48:37.660]   that we run into from day to day.
[00:48:37.660 --> 00:48:40.060]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ's name, amen.
