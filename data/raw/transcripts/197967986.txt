[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.120]   Alright, if you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans chapter 8.
[00:00:09.120 --> 00:00:14.880]   Our main focus is going to be verse 28, but I want to read it in context, verse 26 through
[00:00:14.880 --> 00:00:15.880]   30.
[00:00:15.880 --> 00:00:19.720]   Romans chapter 8, 26 through 30.
[00:00:19.720 --> 00:00:24.740]   "Likewise, the Spirit helps us in our weakness, for we do not know what to pray for as we
[00:00:24.740 --> 00:00:30.320]   ought, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings too deep for words.
[00:00:30.320 --> 00:00:34.480]   And he who searches hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because the Spirit intercedes
[00:00:34.480 --> 00:00:37.000]   for the saints according to the will of God.
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.020]   And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good.
[00:00:41.020 --> 00:00:45.480]   For those who are called according to His purpose, for those whom He foreknew, He also
[00:00:45.480 --> 00:00:50.000]   predestined to be conformed to the image of His Son, in order that He might be the firstborn
[00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:51.800]   among many brothers.
[00:00:51.800 --> 00:00:56.840]   And those whom He predestined, He also called, and those whom He called, He also justified.
[00:00:56.840 --> 00:00:59.480]   And those whom He justified, He also glorified."
[00:00:59.480 --> 00:01:05.120]   Let's pray.
[00:01:05.120 --> 00:01:11.340]   Heavenly Father, we pray that as we've been studying through Romans and refreshing and
[00:01:11.340 --> 00:01:17.080]   renewing our perspective and understanding of Your grace in our lives, I pray that it
[00:01:17.080 --> 00:01:23.280]   would more than just renew our minds, but our hearts, and more than just our hearts,
[00:01:23.280 --> 00:01:25.400]   but our very lives.
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:29.440]   I pray that You would give us help by the Holy Spirit to apply all of these things,
[00:01:29.440 --> 00:01:34.400]   Lord God, that our life may truly be a living sacrifice.
[00:01:34.400 --> 00:01:39.760]   We ask for Your grace this morning as we understand Your grace and Your sovereignty, that it really
[00:01:39.760 --> 00:01:44.360]   would make the impact that You desire and that You have ordained in Your Word.
[00:01:44.360 --> 00:01:45.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:45.360 --> 00:01:46.360]   Amen.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:55.960]   I think one of the most important doctrines, at least the fundamental doctrines, that we
[00:01:55.960 --> 00:01:59.760]   need to be convinced about is the sovereignty of God.
[00:01:59.760 --> 00:02:06.760]   Because our security in Christ is absolutely dependent, it's linked to His sovereignty.
[00:02:06.760 --> 00:02:12.800]   Apostle Paul has been reassuring us that the reason why we can be secure in our salvation
[00:02:12.800 --> 00:02:14.520]   is that the Holy Spirit has been implanted.
[00:02:14.520 --> 00:02:18.760]   He didn't just justify us, He also gave us the Holy Spirit that even in things that we
[00:02:18.760 --> 00:02:24.960]   are weak in, the Holy Spirit is groaning on our behalf, praying and interceding constantly.
[00:02:24.960 --> 00:02:29.880]   But even beyond just the Holy Spirit, the Scripture tells us that we have absolute security
[00:02:29.880 --> 00:02:34.240]   because our God is sovereign, absolutely sovereign.
[00:02:34.240 --> 00:02:37.640]   He is absolutely in control.
[00:02:37.640 --> 00:02:43.680]   I have oftentimes get into discussions with people who have issues with predestination,
[00:02:43.680 --> 00:02:49.840]   and I think I shared this before, in the earlier years of our church when Calvinism or predestination
[00:02:49.840 --> 00:02:51.560]   wasn't a very popular term.
[00:02:51.560 --> 00:02:55.960]   It was, you kind of had pockets of people who were Calvinists.
[00:02:55.960 --> 00:02:59.160]   But I had people straight up come and tell me, "If you're a Calvinist, I can't come to
[00:02:59.160 --> 00:03:00.160]   this church.
[00:03:00.160 --> 00:03:01.480]   I don't believe in predestination."
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:07.600]   Well, sad thing is the Scripture actually uses the term predestination.
[00:03:07.600 --> 00:03:11.520]   So if you don't believe in predestination, you have to reinterpret what the Scripture
[00:03:11.520 --> 00:03:12.520]   says.
[00:03:12.520 --> 00:03:18.560]   And I think the reason why people have a hard time with predestination is because if God
[00:03:18.560 --> 00:03:23.320]   has predetermined salvation, that means we don't have any control.
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:26.760]   And somehow it seems unfair if God didn't leave it up to us.
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:29.720]   He just said, "Here's the truth, and here's the way of salvation.
[00:03:29.720 --> 00:03:32.360]   It's up to you to come and get it."
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.080]   And thinking somehow that seems more fair and just than for Him to sovereignly elect
[00:03:37.080 --> 00:03:39.120]   and choose and predestine.
[00:03:39.120 --> 00:03:46.760]   Well, in human logic, it may sound legitimate, but to say that God is not sovereign, that
[00:03:46.760 --> 00:03:52.680]   God has not elected us, is no different than saying to tell an individual who's colorblind,
[00:03:52.680 --> 00:03:55.760]   and tell them that if you don't match all the colors in the right places, that you can't
[00:03:55.760 --> 00:03:57.860]   be saved.
[00:03:57.860 --> 00:03:59.360]   And somehow that's fair.
[00:03:59.360 --> 00:04:04.000]   Or you tell a young toddler, say, "Here, I'm going to give you a hundred bucks, and I'll
[00:04:04.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   give you some instructions.
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.520]   Hopefully I can meet you on the other side of the country.
[00:04:07.520 --> 00:04:10.400]   And I've given you the free choice to do that.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:13.960]   So if I give you the free choice to do that, and if you make it, you're saved."
[00:04:13.960 --> 00:04:16.000]   That somehow that is more fair.
[00:04:16.000 --> 00:04:23.280]   See, the scripture describes that we are dead in our trespasses.
[00:04:23.280 --> 00:04:28.040]   That we are dead in our, our ability to discern what is right or wrong, what is truth, what
[00:04:28.040 --> 00:04:31.720]   is good, has been tainted by sin.
[00:04:31.720 --> 00:04:36.720]   So to give that option, saying, "Oh, here's the truth, and you come and get it by your
[00:04:36.720 --> 00:04:42.560]   own volition," is no different than telling a toddler, "Here, I'm giving you the choice.
[00:04:42.560 --> 00:04:46.520]   I'm going to be a good parent, and I'm going to be a fair and just parent, and I'm going
[00:04:46.520 --> 00:04:49.960]   to tell you all the right thing to do, but it's up to you to choose it and do the right
[00:04:49.960 --> 00:04:50.960]   thing."
[00:04:50.960 --> 00:04:53.320]   See, that is not how salvation is described.
[00:04:53.320 --> 00:04:58.240]   The Bible describes that all have sinned and fall short of the glory of God.
[00:04:58.240 --> 00:05:04.320]   That we've lost the ability in our natural being to be able to discern right and wrong.
[00:05:04.320 --> 00:05:11.200]   So by our own effort here in the Gospel, we don't have the ability in our fallen nature
[00:05:11.200 --> 00:05:15.880]   to discern what is good and what is right, to even pursue Him, to have an appetite for
[00:05:15.880 --> 00:05:17.740]   Him.
[00:05:17.740 --> 00:05:20.760]   So the Bible describes it, and that's what we've been studying in the Book of Romans.
[00:05:20.760 --> 00:05:25.560]   The whole reason why we even had an appetite, why we even repented, is because the scripture
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:30.160]   says it's His kindness that led us to repentance.
[00:05:30.160 --> 00:05:34.000]   Why were you able to hear the Gospel and understand it and believe it?
[00:05:34.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   It is His kindness.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:37.640]   The Holy Spirit opened your eyes.
[00:05:37.640 --> 00:05:40.560]   The Holy Spirit drew you to Him.
[00:05:40.560 --> 00:05:42.760]   God's sovereign plan was to elect us.
[00:05:42.760 --> 00:05:47.040]   Now, I know when we talk about that, you know, there's always going to be a question, "Well,
[00:05:47.040 --> 00:05:48.560]   that doesn't answer all the questions."
[00:05:48.560 --> 00:05:50.460]   You're right.
[00:05:50.460 --> 00:05:53.440]   We don't have the answers to all the questions.
[00:05:53.440 --> 00:05:59.720]   But the scripture clearly defines and identifies, and the reason why we have absolute security
[00:05:59.720 --> 00:06:02.000]   is because our God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:08.880]   The God who justified us, that same energy that justifies us, will also sanctify us,
[00:06:08.880 --> 00:06:14.000]   and that same passion that sanctified us will also glorify us.
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:22.440]   If our God is not absolutely sovereign, absolutely sovereign, we can't have security.
[00:06:22.440 --> 00:06:27.240]   If it's just a, you know, God left that up to us, and He does His part and we do our
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.880]   part and our sovereignty is contingent upon two parts meeting at the center, we can't
[00:06:32.880 --> 00:06:35.200]   have security.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:36.720]   We're just hoping.
[00:06:36.720 --> 00:06:42.960]   The reason why we have absolute security is because our God, who promises, has absolute
[00:06:42.960 --> 00:06:45.760]   control.
[00:06:45.760 --> 00:06:50.400]   The text that we're looking at in Romans chapter 8, 28, is a passage that we often quote.
[00:06:50.400 --> 00:06:53.420]   My guess is a lot of you have already memorized it.
[00:06:53.420 --> 00:06:59.900]   You probably use it to encourage other people who are going through hard times and suffering.
[00:06:59.900 --> 00:07:05.760]   But this is one of those texts that is a great passage and is a great source of encouragement.
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:09.620]   And just like a lot of other texts in the Bible, that if we're not careful, we can actually
[00:07:09.620 --> 00:07:14.080]   misunderstand and misapply what Paul means by this text.
[00:07:14.080 --> 00:07:18.540]   So we want to make sure that we understand what it says so that our application is consistent
[00:07:18.540 --> 00:07:20.640]   with what God means by it.
[00:07:20.640 --> 00:07:24.720]   So I want to read that passage again because that's going to be our main focus this morning.
[00:07:24.720 --> 00:07:30.540]   Verse 28, "And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good,
[00:07:30.540 --> 00:07:33.560]   for those who are called according to His purpose."
[00:07:33.560 --> 00:07:37.160]   So there's three things that I want to highlight just in this verse.
[00:07:37.160 --> 00:07:44.560]   First of all, he says, "We know," and in summary, he said, "We know that God is sovereign."
[00:07:44.560 --> 00:07:50.740]   If you, again, the text that I read previously, Paul says, "The reason why the Holy Spirit
[00:07:50.740 --> 00:07:54.100]   is given to us is because we don't know what to pray for."
[00:07:54.100 --> 00:07:56.020]   There's a lot of things that we don't understand.
[00:07:56.020 --> 00:08:00.860]   Again, even the things about predestination, we don't fully understand them.
[00:08:00.860 --> 00:08:01.860]   Why did God create us?
[00:08:01.860 --> 00:08:03.460]   Why is there evil in the world?
[00:08:03.460 --> 00:08:07.480]   And we have all of these questions that we don't fully get.
[00:08:07.480 --> 00:08:10.620]   But Paul says, "In contrast to the things that we don't get, even though we don't know
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:14.980]   what to pray for, the Holy Spirit intercedes and cries out on our behalf."
[00:08:14.980 --> 00:08:17.580]   But here's what we do know.
[00:08:17.580 --> 00:08:24.460]   What we do know is that our God is absolutely sovereign, that He works all things for good,
[00:08:24.460 --> 00:08:28.300]   for those who love and who have been called according to His purpose.
[00:08:28.300 --> 00:08:29.300]   That we know.
[00:08:29.300 --> 00:08:35.780]   In fact, that's a confession not only of some Christians, but every Christian, that we know
[00:08:35.780 --> 00:08:36.780]   this.
[00:08:36.780 --> 00:08:44.260]   See, sovereignty of God, believing in His absolute sovereign power, is directly connected
[00:08:44.260 --> 00:08:47.140]   to our eternal security.
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.820]   If God is not absolutely sovereign, and if there is even 1% chance that even after He
[00:08:52.820 --> 00:08:57.500]   said everything, that there's even a 1% chance that that is not going to happen, then God
[00:08:57.500 --> 00:09:00.020]   is not completely sovereign.
[00:09:00.020 --> 00:09:03.240]   Then we can't be completely secure.
[00:09:03.240 --> 00:09:09.500]   The reason why God is able to tell the nation of Israel, "Do not turn from My Word to the
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:13.020]   left or to the right, if you want to be successful."
[00:09:13.020 --> 00:09:20.700]   This is as they're entering into the Promised Land, and about to go into a battle with a
[00:09:20.700 --> 00:09:24.620]   city, with a nation of people who completely slaughtered them.
[00:09:24.620 --> 00:09:29.540]   By any human reason, they should have been absolutely slaughtered by the Canaanites.
[00:09:29.540 --> 00:09:33.260]   And the only instruction He gives them is, "Trust Me, do not turn from Me to the left
[00:09:33.260 --> 00:09:34.260]   or to the right.
[00:09:34.260 --> 00:09:37.900]   Carry this box and go in circles.
[00:09:37.900 --> 00:09:40.160]   Just do what I say."
[00:09:40.160 --> 00:09:43.280]   That would be a ridiculous command, humanly speaking.
[00:09:43.280 --> 00:09:48.860]   The only reason why God is able to say that is because He's absolutely sovereign.
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.240]   The only reason why we're able to have any confidence in the Word of God is because God
[00:09:52.240 --> 00:09:55.220]   is absolutely in control.
[00:09:55.220 --> 00:10:01.280]   He's not predicting the future as something that the Bible teaches.
[00:10:01.280 --> 00:10:03.300]   That is not what the Bible teaches.
[00:10:03.300 --> 00:10:12.400]   See, His promise and comfort would be absolutely nullified if our God is an absolutely sovereign.
[00:10:12.400 --> 00:10:13.400]   If we're saying, "You know what?
[00:10:13.400 --> 00:10:17.300]   Of all the other things that I can rely on, God is probably better."
[00:10:17.300 --> 00:10:18.460]   No, He's not better.
[00:10:18.460 --> 00:10:20.900]   He's the only one that we can rely on.
[00:10:20.900 --> 00:10:23.980]   I can make promise to my children and say, "You know what?
[00:10:23.980 --> 00:10:24.980]   Don't worry.
[00:10:24.980 --> 00:10:26.260]   I will always take care of you."
[00:10:26.260 --> 00:10:28.540]   Now, I mean that in my heart.
[00:10:28.540 --> 00:10:33.540]   That's my intention, and I will give my best effort to take care of my children, but I
[00:10:33.540 --> 00:10:36.540]   don't have control.
[00:10:36.540 --> 00:10:38.780]   I don't have control of even my own will.
[00:10:38.780 --> 00:10:43.420]   I don't have control of finances, my own emotions.
[00:10:43.420 --> 00:10:44.540]   That's my intent.
[00:10:44.540 --> 00:10:47.340]   I don't have the power to carry that out.
[00:10:47.340 --> 00:10:52.180]   So it is good advice, or it is good intention.
[00:10:52.180 --> 00:10:56.940]   But God's promises are not just simply good intentions.
[00:10:56.940 --> 00:11:01.880]   God says it, and He's able to fulfill it because God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:11:01.880 --> 00:11:07.580]   Or else, it's no different than me saying, "You know, I'm going to take care of you."
[00:11:07.580 --> 00:11:12.280]   Our hope, our hope would be nothing more than wishful thinking.
[00:11:12.280 --> 00:11:17.720]   If the book of Revelation is just a book where God has kind of written because He's looking
[00:11:17.720 --> 00:11:21.900]   into a glass, and He's looking into the future, and He sees it.
[00:11:21.900 --> 00:11:26.380]   He's just a better fortune teller than any other fortune teller, right?
[00:11:26.380 --> 00:11:27.380]   Because He gets it right.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:33.540]   If that's all prophecy is, we can't have absolute security.
[00:11:33.540 --> 00:11:35.820]   See, God is sovereign.
[00:11:35.820 --> 00:11:38.820]   He says God is working all things for good.
[00:11:38.820 --> 00:11:43.060]   He can say that because God is sovereign over all things.
[00:11:43.060 --> 00:11:46.260]   If He's not sovereign over all things, there's things that are happening in your life that
[00:11:46.260 --> 00:11:52.140]   is completely random, that God has absolutely no control over.
[00:11:52.140 --> 00:11:57.900]   He can say what He is saying in Romans 8, 28, because God is completely in control.
[00:11:57.900 --> 00:12:01.300]   He's not only sovereign over some things and have no sovereignty over us.
[00:12:01.300 --> 00:12:02.900]   And that's how some people think.
[00:12:02.900 --> 00:12:05.140]   That God can sovereignly move the earth.
[00:12:05.140 --> 00:12:07.500]   God can sovereignly create the universe.
[00:12:07.500 --> 00:12:11.580]   But God doesn't have any sovereignty over us.
[00:12:11.580 --> 00:12:16.920]   He doesn't control us because it wouldn't be fair.
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:18.260]   That's not how the Bible describes it.
[00:12:18.260 --> 00:12:23.000]   In Job 42, 2, it says, "I know that you can do all things, and that no purpose of yours
[00:12:23.000 --> 00:12:26.000]   can be thwarted."
[00:12:26.000 --> 00:12:30.900]   The reason why no purpose of His can be thwarted is because no one can resist God.
[00:12:30.900 --> 00:12:33.900]   Irresistible grace.
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:40.700]   Psalm 135, 6, "Whatever the Lord pleases, He does in heaven and on earth, in the seas
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:44.100]   and all the deeps."
[00:12:44.100 --> 00:12:46.480]   He is not frustrated.
[00:12:46.480 --> 00:12:49.940]   He doesn't have a plan that somehow we're getting in the way.
[00:12:49.940 --> 00:12:54.580]   The Scripture says, "He does what He pleases because our God is absolutely sovereign."
[00:12:54.580 --> 00:13:00.020]   Numbers 23, 19, "God is not man that He should lie, nor the Son of Man that He should change
[00:13:00.020 --> 00:13:01.900]   His mind."
[00:13:01.900 --> 00:13:05.340]   He doesn't plan one thing and then say, "Well, we're going to go to plan B because my plan
[00:13:05.340 --> 00:13:07.860]   A didn't work."
[00:13:07.860 --> 00:13:09.060]   He doesn't have to change His mind.
[00:13:09.060 --> 00:13:10.740]   He is absolutely sovereign.
[00:13:10.740 --> 00:13:12.340]   Has He said and will He not do it?
[00:13:12.340 --> 00:13:15.100]   Or has He spoken and will He not fulfill it?
[00:13:15.100 --> 00:13:20.740]   If our God is not sovereign, absolutely sovereign, these are good sayings.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:27.860]   It may comfort our hearts, but it has no practical application because He's not in control.
[00:13:27.860 --> 00:13:35.060]   The reason why we have absolute security and we read the Scripture as fact, not just encouraging
[00:13:35.060 --> 00:13:43.340]   words but as facts, is because the God who wrote them is in absolute control.
[00:13:43.340 --> 00:13:47.940]   God is not standing by the sideline watching human history, watching your life and my life
[00:13:47.940 --> 00:13:52.060]   unravel and just watching and making predictions.
[00:13:52.060 --> 00:13:54.300]   Scripture says He's actively involved.
[00:13:54.300 --> 00:13:56.380]   We don't know how it works.
[00:13:56.380 --> 00:13:57.620]   We don't know what to pray for.
[00:13:57.620 --> 00:14:04.700]   What we do know is that all things work together for good for those who love Him according
[00:14:04.700 --> 00:14:06.180]   to His purpose.
[00:14:06.180 --> 00:14:09.020]   That we do know.
[00:14:09.020 --> 00:14:12.860]   We don't know how it works, but we do know that our God is in control.
[00:14:12.860 --> 00:14:19.540]   Isaiah 46.10, declaring the end from the beginning.
[00:14:19.540 --> 00:14:22.020]   Even from the very beginning, He declared the end.
[00:14:22.020 --> 00:14:23.020]   How are you doing that?
[00:14:23.020 --> 00:14:26.420]   Well, He's a really good fortune teller.
[00:14:26.420 --> 00:14:28.900]   That's because He's God.
[00:14:28.900 --> 00:14:33.020]   There's things that He's not in control of that He can see way down the line, millions
[00:14:33.020 --> 00:14:37.540]   of years down the line, and that's why He's able to say from the beginning what is at
[00:14:37.540 --> 00:14:38.540]   the end.
[00:14:38.540 --> 00:14:43.860]   No, He's able to declare the end from the beginning because He is in control over the
[00:14:43.860 --> 00:14:45.220]   end and the beginning.
[00:14:45.220 --> 00:14:48.420]   He's the Alpha and the Omega.
[00:14:48.420 --> 00:14:53.140]   Declaring the end from the beginning and from ancient times, things not yet done.
[00:14:53.140 --> 00:14:59.820]   Saying my counsel shall stand and I will accomplish my purpose.
[00:14:59.820 --> 00:15:04.740]   He declares the end from the beginning because He says my purpose cannot be thwarted.
[00:15:04.740 --> 00:15:07.380]   In other words, He's in control.
[00:15:07.380 --> 00:15:11.180]   He fulfills His own promises.
[00:15:11.180 --> 00:15:16.820]   That's why Romans 11.36, it says, "For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things.
[00:15:16.820 --> 00:15:20.580]   To Him be glory forever.
[00:15:20.580 --> 00:15:22.860]   Amen."
[00:15:22.860 --> 00:15:28.900]   Christianity, it hinges upon the sovereignty of God.
[00:15:28.900 --> 00:15:37.180]   If God is not sovereign, then every promise that He made is a maybe.
[00:15:37.180 --> 00:15:39.260]   It's a maybe.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.940]   It might save you.
[00:15:41.940 --> 00:15:44.940]   There might be a heaven.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:47.540]   There might be glory.
[00:15:47.540 --> 00:15:52.900]   If He's not absolutely sovereign and He doesn't have control and there's some outside force
[00:15:52.900 --> 00:15:59.580]   that can stop Him or thwart His purpose, then every promise in Scripture becomes a maybe,
[00:15:59.580 --> 00:16:02.500]   not a yes.
[00:16:02.500 --> 00:16:09.020]   Every security that we have hinges upon this doctrine of His sovereignty.
[00:16:09.020 --> 00:16:12.340]   In fact, there's a lot of practical application to this.
[00:16:12.340 --> 00:16:17.580]   Not just about the big picture in history, but it's even just our daily lives.
[00:16:17.580 --> 00:16:19.960]   What causes you to have security each day?
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:22.620]   Because we believe God is sovereign.
[00:16:22.620 --> 00:16:28.500]   When things go completely out of whack and you don't understand, what causes you to continue
[00:16:28.500 --> 00:16:30.220]   to follow Christ?
[00:16:30.220 --> 00:16:32.500]   Because of His sovereignty.
[00:16:32.500 --> 00:16:38.580]   We wrestle with believing, but what we believe does not change.
[00:16:38.580 --> 00:16:43.780]   We may not understand, but what we do know is that our God is in charge.
[00:16:43.780 --> 00:16:50.900]   See, this promise that He made, this we know.
[00:16:50.900 --> 00:16:55.020]   But the second observation I want to make with you is that this promise is not a universal
[00:16:55.020 --> 00:16:57.860]   promise that covers everything.
[00:16:57.860 --> 00:17:02.500]   It is a very specific promise that is made to those who love Him, who have been called
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   according to His purpose.
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:07.020]   Now, He's not distinguishing between two separate people.
[00:17:07.020 --> 00:17:11.100]   He's not saying that God is sovereign or here's a group of people who love Him and here's
[00:17:11.100 --> 00:17:13.460]   a group of people who've been chosen.
[00:17:13.460 --> 00:17:14.900]   It's the same group.
[00:17:14.900 --> 00:17:18.400]   You know what that tells us?
[00:17:18.400 --> 00:17:22.380]   Those who have been chosen are the ones who love Him.
[00:17:22.380 --> 00:17:28.140]   John 6, 65, He says, "And He said, 'This is why I told you that no one can come to Me
[00:17:28.140 --> 00:17:33.100]   unless it is granted to him by the Father.'"
[00:17:33.100 --> 00:17:39.660]   The whole reason why we heard the Gospel and repented is because God chose us.
[00:17:39.660 --> 00:17:40.940]   God initiated it.
[00:17:40.940 --> 00:17:43.900]   Not you, not me, not the church.
[00:17:43.900 --> 00:17:44.900]   God initiated it.
[00:17:44.900 --> 00:17:49.160]   The reason why you are in a certain situation, that why you had certain friends, why you
[00:17:49.160 --> 00:17:52.880]   were born in a certain family, all of these things that God orchestrated and analyzed
[00:17:52.880 --> 00:17:58.280]   because God's sovereign plan was being revealed in your life.
[00:17:58.280 --> 00:18:03.680]   Matthew 11, 27, "All things have been handed over to Me by My Father and no one knows the
[00:18:03.680 --> 00:18:08.760]   Son except the Father and no one knows the Father except the Son and anyone to whom the
[00:18:08.760 --> 00:18:11.480]   Son chooses to reveal Him."
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:13.200]   How did you come to know Him?
[00:18:13.200 --> 00:18:19.460]   Now, we may say, you know, "I met this person and I did that and I did this and that," and
[00:18:19.460 --> 00:18:20.460]   all of these things.
[00:18:20.460 --> 00:18:28.860]   We may have chosen to do that, but what caused you to hear that and to believe?
[00:18:28.860 --> 00:18:33.080]   We can't even change our appetite.
[00:18:33.080 --> 00:18:37.140]   If you like brownies, you didn't wake up and say, "I'm going to like it today."
[00:18:37.140 --> 00:18:38.140]   Right?
[00:18:38.140 --> 00:18:42.500]   No, you put it in your mouth like, "Mmm, delicious."
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.740]   And somebody else puts it in their mouth like, "Mmm, I don't like it."
[00:18:45.740 --> 00:18:46.740]   Right?
[00:18:46.740 --> 00:18:49.780]   You know, when I was a little kid, I didn't like chocolate.
[00:18:49.780 --> 00:18:51.460]   And some of you guys are like, "What?
[00:18:51.460 --> 00:18:52.460]   How can you?"
[00:18:52.460 --> 00:18:53.460]   I just didn't.
[00:18:53.460 --> 00:18:56.780]   It just tasted bitter to me because God didn't give me a sweet tongue.
[00:18:56.780 --> 00:18:59.060]   Some of you guys have a sweet tongue.
[00:18:59.060 --> 00:19:02.020]   Anything sweet, you're tempted.
[00:19:02.020 --> 00:19:03.100]   Right?
[00:19:03.100 --> 00:19:06.220]   Anything sweet, you can eat a gallon of, whatever it is.
[00:19:06.220 --> 00:19:07.220]   Right?
[00:19:07.220 --> 00:19:08.220]   That's just not me.
[00:19:08.220 --> 00:19:14.900]   I mean, my taste buds is more sweet and sour, you know, beef jerky, like that kind of stuff.
[00:19:14.900 --> 00:19:15.900]   Right?
[00:19:15.900 --> 00:19:16.900]   But I didn't choose that.
[00:19:16.900 --> 00:19:17.900]   Right?
[00:19:17.900 --> 00:19:19.420]   I didn't choose that.
[00:19:19.420 --> 00:19:21.340]   We can't even change our appetite.
[00:19:21.340 --> 00:19:24.140]   Your appetite, you just had.
[00:19:24.140 --> 00:19:28.500]   I mean, you can learn to change it, but you put it in your mouth like, "Oh, I like it."
[00:19:28.500 --> 00:19:30.380]   Or, "I don't like it."
[00:19:30.380 --> 00:19:32.660]   To think that we woke up one day and said, "You know what?
[00:19:32.660 --> 00:19:33.660]   I'm going to love God."
[00:19:34.660 --> 00:19:41.460]   See, the Scripture says the whole reason why even your appetite for the things of God changed,
[00:19:41.460 --> 00:19:45.340]   why you all of a sudden heard the Gospel and believed and repented and decided to follow
[00:19:45.340 --> 00:19:49.100]   Him was because God called you.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.220]   The Son of God chose to reveal Himself to you.
[00:19:54.220 --> 00:20:00.580]   And again, Ephesians 1, 4-5, "Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world,
[00:20:00.580 --> 00:20:07.240]   that we should be holy and blameless before Him in love, He predestined us for the adoption
[00:20:07.240 --> 00:20:10.300]   through Jesus Christ according to the purpose of His will."
[00:20:10.300 --> 00:20:13.860]   You know, in the earlier part of the church where, again, Calvinism and predestination
[00:20:13.860 --> 00:20:18.580]   was not popular, it is kind of like in this generation now, I've had so many conversations,
[00:20:18.580 --> 00:20:20.780]   "Oh, I can't believe in predestination."
[00:20:20.780 --> 00:20:26.780]   And I would always take him to this text and say, "Well, He says, 'He predestined us.'"
[00:20:26.780 --> 00:20:31.660]   In Ephesians 1, 11, "In Him we have obtained an inheritance, having been predestined according
[00:20:31.660 --> 00:20:35.820]   to the purpose of Him who works all things according to the counsel of His will."
[00:20:35.820 --> 00:20:37.980]   So He predestined us.
[00:20:37.980 --> 00:20:43.620]   In fact, if you wrestle with this doctrine of election and predestination, I encourage
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:49.020]   you to take time to comb through the first three chapters of Ephesians.
[00:20:49.020 --> 00:20:55.700]   The first three chapters of Ephesians is basically the doctrine of election that he goes in depth.
[00:20:55.700 --> 00:21:00.660]   And over and over again, he says, "He called us, He elected us, He chose us according to
[00:21:00.660 --> 00:21:05.900]   His purpose, according to His pleasure, according to His will."
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:08.140]   Over and over and over again.
[00:21:08.140 --> 00:21:09.140]   When did He do this?
[00:21:09.140 --> 00:21:11.040]   Before the foundation of the world.
[00:21:11.040 --> 00:21:12.620]   He had us in mind.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.620]   And He pursued us.
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.580]   And so human history unraveled in order for this to happen.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:19.580]   Now I know, as soon as I say that, "Well, then what about this?
[00:21:19.580 --> 00:21:20.660]   And what about the fall?
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:24.980]   What about this?"
[00:21:24.980 --> 00:21:28.860]   We don't understand how it fully works.
[00:21:28.860 --> 00:21:33.900]   God did not reveal to us the intricate details of how predestination and human responsibility
[00:21:33.900 --> 00:21:34.900]   come together.
[00:21:34.900 --> 00:21:36.540]   And here's a perfect example.
[00:21:36.540 --> 00:21:37.540]   And here it is.
[00:21:37.540 --> 00:21:41.880]   Because it's not revealed.
[00:21:41.880 --> 00:21:45.540]   Maybe it is revealed and we just don't get it.
[00:21:45.540 --> 00:21:51.620]   But what He did reveal is His absolute sovereignty.
[00:21:51.620 --> 00:21:56.100]   And sometimes we get so caught up in trying to understand this predestination that we
[00:21:56.100 --> 00:21:58.460]   end up nullifying predestination.
[00:21:58.460 --> 00:22:00.860]   That here's what I understand, here's what I don't understand.
[00:22:00.860 --> 00:22:01.860]   What I understand, I accept.
[00:22:01.860 --> 00:22:04.060]   What I don't understand, I reject.
[00:22:04.060 --> 00:22:09.340]   And as a result of that, we miss the whole point of what God is trying to say.
[00:22:09.340 --> 00:22:14.020]   The whole point of why He talks about election and His predestination and His sovereign will
[00:22:14.020 --> 00:22:21.140]   and purpose is to remind us that you have absolute security.
[00:22:21.140 --> 00:22:26.060]   That you can bank on the promises of God.
[00:22:26.060 --> 00:22:30.220]   You can bank on even more than your bank statements.
[00:22:30.220 --> 00:22:33.140]   Even more than your friends and whatever circumstances that you have.
[00:22:33.140 --> 00:22:36.300]   Your personal experiences.
[00:22:36.300 --> 00:22:39.780]   Your understanding of right and wrong.
[00:22:39.780 --> 00:22:47.740]   You can bank on the promises of God because our God is absolutely sovereign.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:52.100]   That's His main purpose of why He teaches us Romans 8.28.
[00:22:52.100 --> 00:22:58.180]   That no matter how chaotic, no matter how our life just goes out of spin and we don't
[00:22:58.180 --> 00:23:01.860]   understand it, He says we don't know what to pray for.
[00:23:01.860 --> 00:23:05.860]   But what we do know is that our God is working.
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:09.180]   He's not just passively watching.
[00:23:09.180 --> 00:23:10.820]   Our God is in control.
[00:23:10.820 --> 00:23:14.740]   Whatever circumstances that you may be in that you don't fully understand, we don't
[00:23:14.740 --> 00:23:16.060]   know what to pray for.
[00:23:16.060 --> 00:23:18.580]   We don't know exactly how this is going to fit together.
[00:23:18.580 --> 00:23:25.380]   But we do know that God who loves us, who is almighty and all powerful and all sovereign,
[00:23:25.380 --> 00:23:30.520]   is working all of this together for good.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:38.540]   Because He called us and those He called are the ones He says that love.
[00:23:38.540 --> 00:23:47.780]   So you see how He uses the term, the called and those who love God interchangeably?
[00:23:47.780 --> 00:23:51.900]   Romans 5.5 it says, "And hope does not put us to shame because God's love has been poured
[00:23:51.900 --> 00:23:55.420]   into our hearts through the Holy Spirit who has been given to us."
[00:23:55.420 --> 00:24:02.560]   And again, you know this past 1 John 4.19, "We love because He first loved us."
[00:24:02.560 --> 00:24:11.300]   So a Christian, a Christian simply is somebody who loves God.
[00:24:11.300 --> 00:24:13.580]   A Christian is somebody who loves God.
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:15.780]   And it is because you love God you come to church.
[00:24:15.780 --> 00:24:21.100]   It is because you love God you go to missions and you share the gospel and you pray because
[00:24:21.100 --> 00:24:22.200]   of that.
[00:24:22.200 --> 00:24:24.300]   But coming to church doesn't mean you love God.
[00:24:24.300 --> 00:24:26.300]   Going to missions doesn't mean you love God.
[00:24:26.300 --> 00:24:32.420]   That's why the scripture says you can pray tongues with men and of angels if you don't
[00:24:32.420 --> 00:24:33.420]   have love.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:37.500]   It is nothing more than a clanging cymbal or empty gong.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   It means nothing.
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.780]   In fact, He goes so far as to say even if I give my body to be burned and have not love
[00:24:42.780 --> 00:24:45.700]   it means nothing.
[00:24:45.700 --> 00:24:51.740]   Because at the core of what Christianity is and who we are as a Christian is one who loves
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:52.740]   God.
[00:24:52.740 --> 00:24:55.540]   It is not one of many qualities of a Christian.
[00:24:55.540 --> 00:24:58.220]   It is the quality of a Christian.
[00:24:58.220 --> 00:25:02.000]   Basically to call a Christian basically is to say he's a lover of God.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.580]   Maybe we should say that again instead of saying we're Christians.
[00:25:04.580 --> 00:25:05.940]   You know, who are you?
[00:25:05.940 --> 00:25:08.220]   I'm a lover of God.
[00:25:08.220 --> 00:25:12.180]   Because that's how the Bible describes us.
[00:25:12.180 --> 00:25:17.660]   In 1 Corinthians 2.9 it says, "But as it is written, 'No eye has seen, no ear has heard,
[00:25:17.660 --> 00:25:22.020]   nor the heart of man imagined what God has prepared for those who love him.'"
[00:25:22.020 --> 00:25:25.340]   Is he talking about a select group of Christians?
[00:25:25.340 --> 00:25:29.220]   Here's the elect and then here's a group of people who really love God.
[00:25:29.220 --> 00:25:31.940]   No, he's talking to all Christians.
[00:25:31.940 --> 00:25:37.640]   Ephesians 6.24, "Grace be with all of you, all who love our Lord Jesus Christ with love
[00:25:37.640 --> 00:25:38.640]   incorruptible."
[00:25:38.640 --> 00:25:45.380]   Is he talking about grace to some people who are elected who happen to love God and then
[00:25:45.380 --> 00:25:48.260]   those who don't love God, no grace to you?
[00:25:48.260 --> 00:25:53.740]   No, he's talking to all Christians and he describes them as lovers of God.
[00:25:53.740 --> 00:25:58.060]   James 1.12, "Blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he has stood
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.980]   the test he will receive the crown of life which God has promised to those who love him."
[00:26:04.980 --> 00:26:11.420]   So loving God and believing in God is equated as same thing.
[00:26:11.420 --> 00:26:15.020]   A Christian is somebody who loves God.
[00:26:15.020 --> 00:26:20.820]   So you know, you hear this, the first thing that you're going to start thinking to yourself
[00:26:20.820 --> 00:26:24.820]   is like, "Do I love God then?
[00:26:24.820 --> 00:26:26.380]   I sing to God.
[00:26:26.380 --> 00:26:27.380]   I give to God.
[00:26:27.380 --> 00:26:30.380]   I may even serve God.
[00:26:30.380 --> 00:26:34.860]   But do you love God?"
[00:26:34.860 --> 00:26:39.500]   Now all of us, you know, at some points we wrestle with this, but the most fundamental
[00:26:39.500 --> 00:26:42.580]   question we should ask is, "Am I doing enough?"
[00:26:42.580 --> 00:26:44.860]   That shouldn't be the question we ask.
[00:26:44.860 --> 00:26:46.900]   "Oh, did I do my quiet time?"
[00:26:46.900 --> 00:26:48.100]   That shouldn't be the question we ask.
[00:26:48.100 --> 00:26:49.880]   "Oh, how are you doing spiritually?"
[00:26:49.880 --> 00:26:53.620]   And oftentimes we get the answer, "Oh, I've been doing quiet time," or "I haven't been
[00:26:53.620 --> 00:26:55.020]   doing quiet time."
[00:26:55.020 --> 00:26:59.320]   You can do all of that the rest of your life and still not be a lover of God.
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:03.940]   If you can give your body to be burned and have not love and be nothing, you can do quiet
[00:27:03.940 --> 00:27:08.340]   time and have not love and absolutely be nothing.
[00:27:08.340 --> 00:27:13.340]   So when we ask ourselves how we're doing spiritually, the question that we need to be asking is,
[00:27:13.340 --> 00:27:17.780]   "Am I a lover of God?"
[00:27:17.780 --> 00:27:23.300]   I remember as a young Christian reading through the scripture and I realized just how central
[00:27:23.300 --> 00:27:25.420]   this was.
[00:27:25.420 --> 00:27:29.900]   If the greatest commandment, if all of the commandment can be summed up in, "Love the
[00:27:29.900 --> 00:27:34.500]   Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength," it's not one of many qualities,
[00:27:34.500 --> 00:27:39.580]   it's the quality that determines whether you are a follower of Christ or not.
[00:27:39.580 --> 00:27:44.500]   It is the quality that determines if you've given right worship or not.
[00:27:44.500 --> 00:27:49.260]   It's the quality that causes you to see scripture differently, why you evangelize, why you pray.
[00:27:49.260 --> 00:27:53.060]   It is the motivation behind everything that we do.
[00:27:53.060 --> 00:27:57.860]   It is not one of many qualities, it is the quality that identifies a Christian, a lover
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:02.260]   of God.
[00:28:02.260 --> 00:28:06.020]   I remember as a young Christian I was wrestling with this and I think, "Well, if it's the
[00:28:06.020 --> 00:28:14.980]   quality, I can say I believe in God, but do I love God with all my heart, mind, and soul,
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   strength?"
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.380]   And at that time, I wasn't married, I didn't have children, the only thing I can compare
[00:28:19.380 --> 00:28:23.620]   it with, I love my parents, I love my mom.
[00:28:23.620 --> 00:28:26.020]   So I would always compare it with that love.
[00:28:26.020 --> 00:28:29.380]   Do I love God the way I love my mom?
[00:28:29.380 --> 00:28:34.380]   I said, "I don't think I can say that confidently."
[00:28:34.380 --> 00:28:37.460]   And I remember wrestling with that and I would ask people, "What does it mean to love God?"
[00:28:37.460 --> 00:28:42.860]   And I would get all kinds of advice, "Just say it.
[00:28:42.860 --> 00:28:43.860]   Say it a hundred times.
[00:28:43.860 --> 00:28:46.340]   I love you God, I love you God, I love you God.
[00:28:46.340 --> 00:28:47.340]   Eventually you'll love God."
[00:28:48.340 --> 00:28:51.460]   So I don't know how many times I would sit in prayer and I would just say, "I love you
[00:28:51.460 --> 00:28:53.180]   God, I love you God, I love you God."
[00:28:53.180 --> 00:28:57.780]   He said a hundred times, so I had to be a hundred, not 99 times, but a hundred times.
[00:28:57.780 --> 00:28:58.780]   But it never worked.
[00:28:58.780 --> 00:29:00.780]   It just, "This can't be right.
[00:29:00.780 --> 00:29:04.820]   I know I'm young, but this doesn't make sense."
[00:29:04.820 --> 00:29:14.740]   I remember when it really hit me, and again, this commandment to love God, it was during
[00:29:14.740 --> 00:29:19.300]   a period when I was trying to move away from my secular friends because they were a bad
[00:29:19.300 --> 00:29:23.020]   influence on my life, and I was probably a bad influence on them.
[00:29:23.020 --> 00:29:27.220]   And I was trying to make Christian friends, but I wasn't in the Christian world yet.
[00:29:27.220 --> 00:29:30.940]   I was moving away from my old life and trying to embrace a new life, and I was kind of caught
[00:29:30.940 --> 00:29:31.940]   right in the middle.
[00:29:31.940 --> 00:29:35.740]   And it was during that time when I was working full time, going to school full time, and
[00:29:35.740 --> 00:29:37.500]   so I had no time to spend with anybody.
[00:29:37.500 --> 00:29:40.740]   I remember one day, I wasn't living at my parents' house at the time, I was living by
[00:29:40.740 --> 00:29:47.420]   myself, and I happened to be in the closet praying and doing my quiet time.
[00:29:47.420 --> 00:29:49.420]   And I just had a really depressing thought.
[00:29:49.420 --> 00:29:54.860]   I said, "If I died today, how long would it take for somebody to notice that I was gone?"
[00:29:54.860 --> 00:29:57.220]   What a depressing thought, you know?
[00:29:57.220 --> 00:29:59.700]   But it just kind of gripped me that morning.
[00:29:59.700 --> 00:30:02.700]   And then, as I was thinking that, I was thinking, "Ah, maybe three months.
[00:30:02.700 --> 00:30:03.700]   It would take three months."
[00:30:03.700 --> 00:30:05.700]   And the first person who would notice is probably my mom.
[00:30:05.700 --> 00:30:09.700]   "Hey, I haven't seen Peter in a while."
[00:30:09.700 --> 00:30:13.060]   And she would usually send my older brother to come look for me.
[00:30:13.060 --> 00:30:14.780]   So Paul would come and look for me.
[00:30:14.780 --> 00:30:17.780]   So it would take, my guess was about two to three months.
[00:30:17.780 --> 00:30:21.980]   But it was so depressing to think, right?
[00:30:21.980 --> 00:30:24.900]   To think that you could be gone for that long and it would take that long for somebody in
[00:30:24.900 --> 00:30:27.660]   your life to even realize.
[00:30:27.660 --> 00:30:36.140]   But at the same time, as I was having this depressing thought, this moody moment, a thought
[00:30:36.140 --> 00:30:40.060]   came to me, "You know, God knows I'm here."
[00:30:40.060 --> 00:30:45.180]   And then I started thinking, "Not only does God know that I'm here, He sent His only begotten
[00:30:45.180 --> 00:30:50.500]   Son to save me."
[00:30:50.500 --> 00:30:54.580]   I mean, a God who knows, I mean, I can pray and He's hearing my prayers.
[00:30:54.580 --> 00:30:55.900]   He knows I'm in this closet.
[00:30:55.900 --> 00:31:00.680]   I mean, God would know, He even knows what I'm thinking at this moment.
[00:31:00.680 --> 00:31:05.460]   And I started thinking, and no thought I had at that moment was any different than what
[00:31:05.460 --> 00:31:06.460]   I knew before.
[00:31:06.460 --> 00:31:08.140]   But all of a sudden, it made so much sense.
[00:31:08.140 --> 00:31:11.740]   It became real to me.
[00:31:11.740 --> 00:31:18.700]   That the gospel that I've been embracing and I've been singing about, that changed me.
[00:31:18.700 --> 00:31:19.700]   It became personal.
[00:31:19.700 --> 00:31:25.060]   That He didn't just love the world, He loved me.
[00:31:25.060 --> 00:31:29.820]   He didn't just die for the sins of the world, He died for me.
[00:31:29.820 --> 00:31:38.540]   And I remember just thinking, "Wow, I'm having all these moody thoughts."
[00:31:38.540 --> 00:31:43.300]   And yet God used that to remind me why He came.
[00:31:43.300 --> 00:31:48.820]   And as the scripture says, "My love for Him grew because He first loved me, because His
[00:31:48.820 --> 00:31:51.640]   love became real to me."
[00:31:51.640 --> 00:31:55.740]   It wasn't just some theology, it wasn't just something we were studying, it became real
[00:31:55.740 --> 00:31:58.380]   to me.
[00:31:58.380 --> 00:32:05.860]   And it is difficult to love something or someone that loves you that much.
[00:32:05.860 --> 00:32:10.780]   Even a dog, those of you guys who own pets, if your dog came and bit you every day, you
[00:32:10.780 --> 00:32:11.780]   wouldn't love that dog.
[00:32:11.780 --> 00:32:13.660]   I don't care how cute that dog is.
[00:32:13.660 --> 00:32:14.660]   "Oh, isn't he cute?"
[00:32:14.660 --> 00:32:17.540]   And then you go by him and then boom.
[00:32:17.540 --> 00:32:18.540]   Every morning, bite you.
[00:32:18.540 --> 00:32:24.940]   I mean, I think a lot of people like pets and dogs because supposedly they give you
[00:32:24.940 --> 00:32:25.940]   unconditional love.
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:28.500]   I don't think so.
[00:32:28.500 --> 00:32:32.420]   Stop feeding that dog for a while, they don't give you unconditional love.
[00:32:32.420 --> 00:32:33.420]   It's very conditioned.
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:40.280]   But whatever the case, it's hard not to love something or someone that loves you that much.
[00:32:40.280 --> 00:32:42.860]   You love your parents.
[00:32:42.860 --> 00:32:48.020]   You remember, now that even though you're older, despite everything that you've said
[00:32:48.020 --> 00:32:50.740]   to them and done to them, they stuck with you and they were patient.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.380]   Who's been the most patient in your life?
[00:32:52.380 --> 00:32:55.040]   Then your mom or your dad.
[00:32:55.040 --> 00:33:00.900]   Your love for them is a response to what they did for you.
[00:33:00.900 --> 00:33:06.820]   Husband and wife, after all these years, all the dumb things you'd said and did and selfishness
[00:33:06.820 --> 00:33:12.140]   and despite all of that, all these years, they stuck with you.
[00:33:12.140 --> 00:33:16.460]   And they love you, they serve you, they protect you.
[00:33:16.460 --> 00:33:21.380]   Try really hard not to love them.
[00:33:21.380 --> 00:33:26.620]   It's hard not to love somebody that loves you that much.
[00:33:26.620 --> 00:33:33.620]   And then to think that this love that we sing about and profess every single Sunday is beyond
[00:33:33.620 --> 00:33:38.460]   anything that you and I have ever imagined, we can articulate.
[00:33:38.460 --> 00:33:42.900]   The only reason that doesn't affect us is because we've been distracted and our faith
[00:33:42.900 --> 00:33:45.460]   has become small.
[00:33:45.460 --> 00:33:51.040]   But the moment that becomes real to you, we're always searching for something new.
[00:33:51.040 --> 00:33:52.420]   It's not something new.
[00:33:52.420 --> 00:33:56.120]   It's what's old that needs to become real.
[00:33:56.120 --> 00:34:01.340]   If you've lost your first love, he says, remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:34:01.340 --> 00:34:04.500]   Remember it doesn't say go look for something new.
[00:34:04.500 --> 00:34:08.900]   It's the fundamental things that cause you to be a believer of Christ you strayed from.
[00:34:08.900 --> 00:34:13.740]   He says, so remember the height from which you had fallen.
[00:34:13.740 --> 00:34:17.740]   Maybe the reason why it's harder for us to respond in love is because it's just become
[00:34:17.740 --> 00:34:20.080]   a theory.
[00:34:20.080 --> 00:34:24.000]   It's just become theology, but it's not real.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:26.780]   That we need to renew our love.
[00:34:26.780 --> 00:34:30.520]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:34:30.520 --> 00:34:35.580]   And that's why he equates somebody who has been chosen by God is a one who loves God.
[00:34:35.580 --> 00:34:40.100]   You've been chosen because God loves you.
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.220]   The motivation behind why he sent his only begotten son is unimaginable.
[00:34:44.220 --> 00:34:51.660]   I mean, isn't that the reason even when you have a tendency to drift that always God brings
[00:34:51.660 --> 00:34:57.580]   you back is when God reminds you of his grace and love for you.
[00:34:57.580 --> 00:35:00.140]   Even when you rebel, what caused you to repent?
[00:35:00.140 --> 00:35:02.780]   What caused you to come back?
[00:35:02.780 --> 00:35:08.540]   Wasn't it when the love of God just gripped your heart?
[00:35:08.540 --> 00:35:15.260]   That's why he says all things work together for good for those who love him, who have
[00:35:15.260 --> 00:35:20.820]   been called according to his purpose.
[00:35:20.820 --> 00:35:25.180]   James 1 12, blessed is the man who remains steadfast under trial for when he has stood
[00:35:25.180 --> 00:35:29.660]   the test, he will receive the crown of life to which God has promised to those who love
[00:35:29.660 --> 00:35:31.580]   him.
[00:35:31.580 --> 00:35:33.260]   We know that God is working together.
[00:35:33.260 --> 00:35:34.740]   All things are working together.
[00:35:34.740 --> 00:35:41.300]   The word working together is synergy where we get the word synergy.
[00:35:41.300 --> 00:35:46.620]   It means that all of these things God is orchestrating to bring it together.
[00:35:46.620 --> 00:35:49.700]   Now whenever we talk about the sovereignty of God and predestination, it's really hard
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:54.820]   to understand because I just raised my hand, right?
[00:35:54.820 --> 00:35:55.820]   I wasn't a robot.
[00:35:55.820 --> 00:35:56.900]   I did it.
[00:35:56.900 --> 00:35:58.380]   You came to church this morning.
[00:35:58.380 --> 00:36:00.100]   You took the shower.
[00:36:00.100 --> 00:36:02.180]   You invited your friends.
[00:36:02.180 --> 00:36:05.200]   So we always wrestle with how does this work?
[00:36:05.200 --> 00:36:11.300]   But even non-Calvinist, when they describe their salvation, always becomes a Calvinist,
[00:36:11.300 --> 00:36:12.460]   right?
[00:36:12.460 --> 00:36:17.100]   They always talk about how God orchestrated their life to bring them to a certain point.
[00:36:17.100 --> 00:36:21.500]   Even though they have a hard time and they reject predestination going forward, they
[00:36:21.500 --> 00:36:25.500]   always become a predestination person when they talk about their past life.
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:28.100]   Well, how did you become a Christian?
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:36.140]   Oh, you know, my parents moved here and God somehow allowed me to run into this person
[00:36:36.140 --> 00:36:41.500]   and God somehow opened the door for me to come to this church.
[00:36:41.500 --> 00:36:48.460]   And so we become a Calvinist when we talk about our past and how we got here.
[00:36:48.460 --> 00:36:53.820]   Whatever your testimony is, every single one of us will confess that we can see God's
[00:36:53.820 --> 00:36:58.420]   sovereign hands upon your life that caused you to come to a certain point to hear the
[00:36:58.420 --> 00:37:02.540]   gospel and understand and accept and repent and come.
[00:37:02.540 --> 00:37:03.860]   Every single one of us.
[00:37:03.860 --> 00:37:07.660]   Whether you like the term predestination or not.
[00:37:07.660 --> 00:37:11.180]   Because you know it wasn't you.
[00:37:11.180 --> 00:37:14.860]   You know that God orchestrated certain things.
[00:37:14.860 --> 00:37:23.140]   I remember before I became a Christian, I was one angry kid.
[00:37:23.140 --> 00:37:26.940]   And I didn't realize this when I was, when we first came to the United States, I was
[00:37:26.940 --> 00:37:31.100]   just excited about coming to the US and having all the bananas in the world.
[00:37:31.100 --> 00:37:34.660]   You know, like I love bananas and Korea bananas was too expensive.
[00:37:34.660 --> 00:37:38.300]   And so I was looking forward to having bananas.
[00:37:38.300 --> 00:37:41.100]   And so that's all I remember the first time coming to the United States.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:45.820]   My parents decided to go back about four or five years after we were here.
[00:37:45.820 --> 00:37:51.260]   And by that time, you know, that the honeymoon of coming to the US has already died down.
[00:37:51.260 --> 00:37:55.860]   You know, I'm being called a dumb chink, you know, so many times I thought that was my
[00:37:55.860 --> 00:37:59.860]   middle name, you know, and then going back to Korea, I said, Oh, I'm going back to my
[00:37:59.860 --> 00:38:01.380]   home country.
[00:38:01.380 --> 00:38:05.820]   And then hearing from, from my Korean friends to go back to your country.
[00:38:05.820 --> 00:38:06.820]   I was like, what?
[00:38:06.820 --> 00:38:08.700]   I thought I was at my country.
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.380]   And I got confused and going, you know, you're about to hit puberty.
[00:38:11.380 --> 00:38:13.100]   And like, I don't belong in Korea.
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:14.340]   I don't belong in the United States.
[00:38:14.340 --> 00:38:15.340]   Like, who am I?
[00:38:15.340 --> 00:38:19.100]   And so second time my parents decided to come back to the United States, I was bitter and
[00:38:19.100 --> 00:38:20.100]   I was angry.
[00:38:20.100 --> 00:38:24.180]   And on top of that, my parents moved around so much.
[00:38:24.180 --> 00:38:28.780]   And so by the time I was 15, 16 years old, I was, my behavior was so destructive.
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.660]   I was literally on the edge.
[00:38:30.660 --> 00:38:33.060]   Anything could have set me off.
[00:38:33.060 --> 00:38:36.260]   I was already getting into trouble with the police.
[00:38:36.260 --> 00:38:40.780]   And literally, I mean, I could care less if I lived or died at that moment.
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:43.220]   I was that angry.
[00:38:43.220 --> 00:38:47.660]   And I remember when I met the Lord at the retreat.
[00:38:47.660 --> 00:38:54.820]   All of a sudden, that instantaneously, all of a sudden, everything made sense.
[00:38:54.820 --> 00:39:00.860]   Because all of that stuff, all of the anger that I had, all the pain that I was experiencing,
[00:39:00.860 --> 00:39:02.500]   all was for a purpose.
[00:39:02.500 --> 00:39:07.180]   God orchestrated all of that to bring me to a point so that I could listen to Him and
[00:39:07.180 --> 00:39:10.060]   understand Him and desire Him.
[00:39:10.060 --> 00:39:15.700]   And so all of that, all this stuff, all this thing that made me angry, all of a sudden,
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:21.860]   knowing that God was behind it, made sense to me.
[00:39:21.860 --> 00:39:24.740]   And that's why, from that moment on, I said, "You know, I'm going to spend the rest of
[00:39:24.740 --> 00:39:25.740]   my life telling people."
[00:39:25.740 --> 00:39:28.500]   I mean, I was at the verge of just jumping off a bridge.
[00:39:28.500 --> 00:39:30.500]   And all of a sudden, God gives me this new life.
[00:39:30.500 --> 00:39:33.380]   And everything that I've experienced up to this point made sense.
[00:39:33.380 --> 00:39:36.460]   I didn't understand the predestination at that time.
[00:39:36.460 --> 00:39:39.820]   I didn't understand the sovereignty and how this works.
[00:39:39.820 --> 00:39:46.420]   All I knew was that all of it was a purpose, and I clearly saw it.
[00:39:46.420 --> 00:39:52.260]   Every single one of us, whether your testimony was dramatic or whether you think it's mundane,
[00:39:52.260 --> 00:39:57.460]   God orchestrated your life in such a way so that you would hear the Gospel and that you
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:40:01.260]   would believe and repent and come to Him.
[00:40:01.260 --> 00:40:08.900]   So you can clearly see that all things up to this point have been working towards what
[00:40:08.900 --> 00:40:12.260]   God desires in your life.
[00:40:12.260 --> 00:40:19.180]   This church, oftentimes, now that a church is certain size, we have young pastors coming
[00:40:19.180 --> 00:40:21.580]   into town saying, "You're going to plant a church."
[00:40:21.580 --> 00:40:24.780]   And I would meet up with them, and they would ask me, "Oh, you've been, your church has
[00:40:24.780 --> 00:40:26.100]   been around almost 20 years.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:27.100]   What was it like?
[00:40:27.100 --> 00:40:30.660]   And can you give me some advice for church planting?"
[00:40:30.660 --> 00:40:34.460]   And my usual advice is, "Hang on for dear life."
[00:40:34.460 --> 00:40:36.860]   That's usually what I tell them.
[00:40:36.860 --> 00:40:40.660]   Because our church was not a normal church plant.
[00:40:40.660 --> 00:40:41.660]   We didn't plant this church.
[00:40:41.660 --> 00:40:43.820]   I didn't have this great idea, "We're going to plant this church.
[00:40:43.820 --> 00:40:48.140]   We're going to reach or remind students, and we're going to use this strategy, so we need
[00:40:48.140 --> 00:40:50.980]   this much funding, and we need these many people."
[00:40:50.980 --> 00:40:52.940]   That's not how it happened.
[00:40:52.940 --> 00:40:54.580]   I was completely burnt out.
[00:40:54.580 --> 00:40:58.780]   I was almost done with ministry, on the verge of quitting.
[00:40:58.780 --> 00:41:03.980]   And then I heard, I got a phone call from a former student of mine who was a college
[00:41:03.980 --> 00:41:09.300]   freshman or sophomore, saying that this church, this church, at that time it was called Harvest
[00:41:09.300 --> 00:41:10.300]   Community Church.
[00:41:10.300 --> 00:41:15.900]   He said, "The Harvest Community Church got planted, and the pastor who planted the church
[00:41:15.900 --> 00:41:17.820]   ended up taking off after two months."
[00:41:17.820 --> 00:41:19.880]   And to this day, I don't know why.
[00:41:19.880 --> 00:41:23.900]   And I got a phone call saying, "Hey, Peter, we heard that you're in between church."
[00:41:23.900 --> 00:41:27.140]   So I was at another church, and that church ended up splitting in half.
[00:41:27.140 --> 00:41:31.220]   So I ended up coming out in between church, and I was really contemplating just going
[00:41:31.220 --> 00:41:32.460]   into business.
[00:41:32.460 --> 00:41:37.780]   And I get a phone call, "Hey, we need your help, because the church is about to dissolve."
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:42.780]   And it was an English ministry of a Korean church that became independent.
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:44.600]   So it was a church within a church.
[00:41:44.600 --> 00:41:50.580]   So the only reason why I ended up going back is because, one, I was burnt out, and I wasn't
[00:41:50.580 --> 00:41:52.900]   ready for any kind of ministry.
[00:41:52.900 --> 00:41:57.140]   So I thought that would be a safe place for me to be, just kind of go there, and just
[00:41:57.140 --> 00:42:01.500]   kind of watch over them, because I already know these kids, and I felt like they're
[00:42:01.500 --> 00:42:02.940]   going to dissolve if I don't go.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:07.300]   So it was more to kind of do a supporting work, and hopefully they would stabilize
[00:42:07.300 --> 00:42:08.300]   enough.
[00:42:08.300 --> 00:42:12.660]   I had no desire, no plans to do church planting.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:17.860]   Once we got there, we found out the senior pastor who came in as an interim had a completely
[00:42:17.860 --> 00:42:19.640]   different idea.
[00:42:19.640 --> 00:42:23.380]   He wanted us to be more Koreanized, speak Korean, sing Korean songs.
[00:42:23.380 --> 00:42:26.580]   It's like, we have people who aren't Korean in our congregation.
[00:42:26.580 --> 00:42:28.140]   We can't do that.
[00:42:28.140 --> 00:42:32.060]   And he was very charismatic, and theologically that just didn't fit.
[00:42:32.060 --> 00:42:38.420]   So he was making certain demands, and so we begged him, I begged him to allow us to stay,
[00:42:38.420 --> 00:42:41.700]   because this church, if we go out, we're going to die.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:45.420]   You know, we have college freshmen are the oldest people in our church.
[00:42:45.420 --> 00:42:47.340]   You know, we have one or two working people.
[00:42:47.340 --> 00:42:50.460]   And I just had a kid, you know, I have a young family.
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:53.220]   Like, we're not ready to plant a church.
[00:42:53.220 --> 00:42:57.680]   We tried for about a whole year, and it just didn't work out.
[00:42:57.680 --> 00:43:01.700]   So they asked us to go, and so we ended up leaving.
[00:43:01.700 --> 00:43:05.980]   Long story short, a lot of things happened the first six, seven years of the church,
[00:43:05.980 --> 00:43:07.380]   but it was not a church plant.
[00:43:07.380 --> 00:43:12.180]   The only reason why we stuck together is because I was afraid that the early members of the
[00:43:12.180 --> 00:43:14.060]   church would not survive if I left.
[00:43:14.060 --> 00:43:16.740]   That was the only reason.
[00:43:16.740 --> 00:43:21.180]   It wasn't because we had this vision of a church, or we want to reach Irvine, and had
[00:43:21.180 --> 00:43:22.500]   this great vision.
[00:43:22.500 --> 00:43:27.160]   I may have had that about six, seven years before the church plant, but by the time this
[00:43:27.160 --> 00:43:29.500]   church plant was happening, I was burnt out.
[00:43:29.500 --> 00:43:32.380]   I was one leg in, one leg out.
[00:43:32.380 --> 00:43:36.620]   And I had a bunch of young guys who had no idea what they were doing, and I didn't think
[00:43:36.620 --> 00:43:37.700]   they were going to make it.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:41.900]   And so we just stuck together, and just had worship on Sunday, and had Bible study on
[00:43:41.900 --> 00:43:44.100]   Friday, and that was it.
[00:43:44.100 --> 00:43:51.180]   And then we had another kid, and another kid, and added more financial burdens to the church.
[00:43:51.180 --> 00:43:56.440]   I look back at the first six, seven years of our church history, we shouldn't be here.
[00:43:56.440 --> 00:44:03.500]   And trust me, I had every friend that I had in my life who was concerned for me, give
[00:44:03.500 --> 00:44:05.820]   me wise counsel to quit.
[00:44:05.820 --> 00:44:09.500]   "Peter, why are you doing that?
[00:44:09.500 --> 00:44:11.180]   Come to my church, they'll take care of your needs.
[00:44:11.180 --> 00:44:12.620]   You have small children at home."
[00:44:12.620 --> 00:44:19.500]   And again, the reason why I share with you all of this stuff is because whatever benefit
[00:44:19.500 --> 00:44:28.660]   that you may have benefited from this ministry, human perspective was completely random.
[00:44:28.660 --> 00:44:32.000]   But obviously we don't believe it was random.
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:33.580]   God orchestrated all of that.
[00:44:33.580 --> 00:44:39.940]   I couldn't have foreseen that six, seven years into the church.
[00:44:39.940 --> 00:44:45.180]   So we can see God's sovereign plan, why He did what He did.
[00:44:45.180 --> 00:44:49.500]   Why He made us go through all of that, and how He used that to bring us where we are
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:50.500]   today.
[00:44:50.500 --> 00:44:55.420]   It wasn't orchestrated, it wasn't planned, it wasn't because we had this lofty vision,
[00:44:55.420 --> 00:44:59.500]   or we implemented the right strategy.
[00:44:59.500 --> 00:45:03.860]   And the moment that we forget that our God is sovereign is when we are weak.
[00:45:03.860 --> 00:45:08.180]   When we think that if we're smart enough, if we're clever enough, so somehow we can
[00:45:08.180 --> 00:45:10.980]   bear better fruit for God.
[00:45:10.980 --> 00:45:16.660]   See, the scripture reminds us that God is the one who's working.
[00:45:16.660 --> 00:45:18.980]   He's the one synergizing.
[00:45:18.980 --> 00:45:22.460]   He's the one who's putting all of this, even the things that you don't understand, especially
[00:45:22.460 --> 00:45:25.740]   the things that you don't fully understand.
[00:45:25.740 --> 00:45:29.380]   You know why we started going out to China for missions?
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:35.860]   During that period, I had to pay bills, and so I became an ESL teacher.
[00:45:35.860 --> 00:45:39.300]   And I was teaching ESL for about five years.
[00:45:39.300 --> 00:45:44.540]   And the whole time I was teaching ESL, I was, "What am I doing?"
[00:45:44.540 --> 00:45:49.260]   I was spending about four or five hours teaching ESL, and another about hour and a half preparing
[00:45:49.260 --> 00:45:50.260]   for ESL.
[00:45:50.260 --> 00:45:53.220]   So basically all my day was filled with teaching ESL.
[00:45:53.220 --> 00:45:54.620]   You know, it's just to pay bills.
[00:45:54.620 --> 00:45:58.660]   And while the church was struggling, and so for five years I was doing this, I'm like,
[00:45:58.660 --> 00:46:02.940]   "Wow, God, you called me into ministry, and I'm doing all this, and I'm spending basically
[00:46:02.940 --> 00:46:08.620]   morning till night thinking about how to teach English."
[00:46:08.620 --> 00:46:14.180]   And then in the midst of that, I got news that China's beginning to open up and allowing
[00:46:14.180 --> 00:46:19.820]   foreigners to come in, and our in is to come and teach English to the students.
[00:46:19.820 --> 00:46:25.400]   At that time, foreigners weren't coming in and out of China like that in 1999, 2000.
[00:46:25.400 --> 00:46:29.360]   So because we were able to teach English, and I had the English credential, I contacted
[00:46:29.360 --> 00:46:34.660]   our Southern Baptist Mission Board and told them, "Hey, I'm an ESL teacher, and I can
[00:46:34.660 --> 00:46:37.920]   train our guys to come and teach English where you need us."
[00:46:37.920 --> 00:46:41.900]   And so that's what caused us to come into China.
[00:46:41.900 --> 00:46:47.100]   During the five years, all I was thinking was, "Why?
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:49.980]   Why am I doing this?
[00:46:49.980 --> 00:46:52.300]   Why is this so hard?"
[00:46:52.300 --> 00:46:58.100]   See, it's hard to understand looking from here and looking forward, but when you see
[00:46:58.100 --> 00:47:04.180]   behind you, you can clearly see the sovereignty of God.
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:08.380]   Now, we may not know everything.
[00:47:08.380 --> 00:47:11.620]   The Holy Spirit is praying on our behalf on the things that we don't know, but what we
[00:47:11.620 --> 00:47:18.940]   do know is that all things are working together for good, for those who love Him, who have
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.300]   been called according to His purpose.
[00:47:21.300 --> 00:47:28.100]   And that's why we can say with confidence in Matthew 10, 29, "Are not two sparrows sold
[00:47:28.100 --> 00:47:32.540]   for a penny, and not one of them fall to the ground apart from your Father?
[00:47:32.540 --> 00:47:37.300]   Yet even the hairs of your head are all numbered."
[00:47:37.300 --> 00:47:39.580]   That's the God that we worship.
[00:47:39.580 --> 00:47:41.660]   That's why that verse comforts us.
[00:47:41.660 --> 00:47:45.500]   And again, I want to read one more passage in 1 Peter 5, 6-7.
[00:47:45.500 --> 00:47:50.500]   "Humble yourselves, therefore, unto the mighty hand of God, so that at the proper time He
[00:47:50.500 --> 00:47:56.300]   may exalt you, casting all your anxieties on Him, because He cares for you."
[00:47:56.300 --> 00:48:01.340]   If our God is not sovereign, that wouldn't be a source of encouragement.
[00:48:01.340 --> 00:48:03.980]   It'd just be nice words.
[00:48:03.980 --> 00:48:07.460]   But the reason why it's an encouragement, the reason why it changes us, is because a
[00:48:07.460 --> 00:48:13.660]   sovereign God who controls human history is in control.
[00:48:13.660 --> 00:48:16.460]   But He's not just in control.
[00:48:16.460 --> 00:48:18.620]   He says He cares.
[00:48:18.620 --> 00:48:20.700]   He cares.
[00:48:20.700 --> 00:48:27.340]   Even the strands on your head, He cares.
[00:48:27.340 --> 00:48:32.220]   This God is worth worshiping, and following, and trusting.
[00:48:32.220 --> 00:48:37.580]   I don't know what's happening in your life right now, and I know that there's things
[00:48:37.580 --> 00:48:42.340]   that may be happening in your life that you don't fully understand.
[00:48:42.340 --> 00:48:44.860]   Why is this happening?
[00:48:44.860 --> 00:48:49.540]   Why did God allow this to happen?
[00:48:49.540 --> 00:48:55.460]   And I want to encourage you, as we remember the suffering of Christ and His incarnation,
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:49:01.180]   as you think about His incarnation, think about why He came.
[00:49:01.180 --> 00:49:06.180]   He didn't just come to save the world, or to give an example.
[00:49:06.180 --> 00:49:12.580]   His incarnation was coming after you.
[00:49:12.580 --> 00:49:16.140]   He came after you.
[00:49:16.140 --> 00:49:18.260]   Where you're sitting.
[00:49:18.260 --> 00:49:21.260]   Because He saw your suffering.
[00:49:21.260 --> 00:49:24.420]   He saw the pain caused by your sins.
[00:49:24.420 --> 00:49:27.580]   He saw the judgment that's waiting for mankind.
[00:49:27.580 --> 00:49:28.740]   He saw your pain.
[00:49:28.740 --> 00:49:30.180]   He heard your groaning.
[00:49:30.180 --> 00:49:35.340]   And so He stepped off of His throne, and He came after you.
[00:49:35.340 --> 00:49:37.820]   That's what Christmas is about.
[00:49:37.820 --> 00:49:43.180]   So I pray that as we gear up to celebrate Christmas, that it would not simply be about
[00:49:43.180 --> 00:49:50.100]   the theology of Christmas, of Emmanuel, and the meaning behind all of that.
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:55.020]   But that you would remember that He first loved you.
[00:49:55.020 --> 00:49:59.580]   That we would be able to confess with all honesty, "We love you too."
[00:49:59.580 --> 00:50:00.580]   Let's pray.
[00:50:00.580 --> 00:50:19.380]   And I want to invite you to take some time to pray and reflect upon Romans 8.28.
[00:50:19.380 --> 00:50:23.060]   And I don't know what kind of difficulties or suffering that you, or maybe somebody you
[00:50:23.060 --> 00:50:26.940]   love are going through.
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:32.300]   And maybe you've filled your mind with things that have nothing to do with God, and you've
[00:50:32.300 --> 00:50:39.900]   left very little room for God's love to affect you.
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:42.300]   Let's take this time to call you for the Lord.
[00:50:42.300 --> 00:50:43.660]   "Lord, I believe.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.460]   Help my unbelief.
[00:50:45.460 --> 00:50:51.260]   Help me to move away from these distractions and hopefully take some time during this Christmas
[00:50:51.260 --> 00:50:57.260]   season to really think upon the sacrifice that He made for us.
[00:50:57.260 --> 00:51:01.820]   That our worship and love and confession may simply be a reasonable response.
[00:51:01.820 --> 00:51:04.900]   So let's take some time to think and to pray as our worship team needs us."
[00:51:04.900 --> 00:51:06.960]   you
