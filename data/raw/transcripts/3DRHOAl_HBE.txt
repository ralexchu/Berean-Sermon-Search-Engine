[00:07:47.080 --> 00:08:04.860]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:08:04.860 --> 00:08:06.500]   Let's all rise together.
[00:08:06.500 --> 00:08:11.500]   And just in the climate, if you are able to,
[00:08:11.800 --> 00:08:14.040]   we wanna practice some kind of distancing.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:16.440]   If you want, you could spread out a little bit more
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.680]   if you'd like, not required,
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:22.160]   but just a suggestion if you can.
[00:08:22.160 --> 00:08:24.840]   So with that, let's go ahead and pray together.
[00:08:24.840 --> 00:08:31.480]   Father, we thank you that we have a hope in Christ.
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:35.000]   We thank you, Lord, that we have an inheritance
[00:08:35.000 --> 00:08:37.840]   that will never fade, rot, or spoil.
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.680]   Lord, in these trying times, in these interesting times,
[00:08:43.680 --> 00:08:45.880]   help us, Lord, reflect on who you are,
[00:08:45.880 --> 00:08:48.800]   for you are sovereign.
[00:08:48.800 --> 00:08:50.640]   You sit on your throne.
[00:08:50.640 --> 00:08:51.900]   You are in control.
[00:08:51.900 --> 00:08:55.960]   So I pray that as we see fear and panic
[00:08:55.960 --> 00:08:58.000]   around us in the world,
[00:08:58.000 --> 00:09:03.000]   help us, Lord, be grounded in who we know, and that is you.
[00:09:03.000 --> 00:09:07.120]   Help us, Lord God, as we come,
[00:09:07.120 --> 00:09:10.780]   as we've desired to make your name known.
[00:09:10.780 --> 00:09:16.040]   Help us, Lord God, in the gathering of the body of Christ
[00:09:16.040 --> 00:09:21.000]   to exalt you, for you are worthy of praise and adoration.
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.140]   Lord, I pray that as we sing,
[00:09:25.140 --> 00:09:29.200]   as we think about our current circumstance,
[00:09:29.200 --> 00:09:30.620]   as we hear your word,
[00:09:30.620 --> 00:09:36.320]   help us be renewed, help us be empowered
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:39.640]   to use the opportunities and this season
[00:09:39.640 --> 00:09:45.280]   to be sober, to think clearly, to be wise,
[00:09:45.280 --> 00:09:49.520]   that, Lord, our witness may be powerful,
[00:09:49.520 --> 00:09:51.240]   that our light may shine brightly,
[00:09:51.240 --> 00:09:54.380]   that ultimately you may receive more glory.
[00:09:54.380 --> 00:09:58.720]   So, God, I pray for our service today.
[00:09:58.720 --> 00:10:00.280]   I pray for our hearts.
[00:10:00.280 --> 00:10:03.280]   I pray, Lord, that we may be softened
[00:10:04.560 --> 00:10:08.200]   and that your name may be extolled through the songs,
[00:10:08.200 --> 00:10:13.200]   that we may glean much wisdom, encouragement,
[00:10:13.200 --> 00:10:14.800]   and challenge through your word.
[00:10:14.800 --> 00:10:17.440]   And ultimately, Lord, we want to,
[00:10:17.440 --> 00:10:20.120]   the reason why we're here is for you
[00:10:20.120 --> 00:10:22.440]   and to give you the glory that you deserve.
[00:10:22.440 --> 00:10:25.480]   So I pray, Lord, that that may take place
[00:10:25.480 --> 00:10:30.160]   and you may be pleased with the worship we bring,
[00:10:30.160 --> 00:10:33.080]   praying, Lord, that we may be spirit-filled
[00:10:33.080 --> 00:10:36.880]   and that it may be worship in spirit and in truth.
[00:10:36.880 --> 00:10:39.280]   We thank you for this time, it's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:10:39.280 --> 00:10:40.120]   Amen.

[00:17:07.900 --> 00:17:22.040]   - As I was thinking through this week,
[00:17:22.040 --> 00:17:25.000]   this song kinda, I was reflecting on this song.
[00:17:25.000 --> 00:17:26.560]   I wanna, if you could put that up,
[00:17:26.560 --> 00:17:28.160]   go over the lyrics with you.
[00:17:28.160 --> 00:17:31.760]   It says, "Oh, Lord, my rock and my redeemer,
[00:17:31.760 --> 00:17:34.880]   greatest treasure of my longing soul.
[00:17:34.880 --> 00:17:37.200]   My God, like you, there is no other.
[00:17:37.200 --> 00:17:40.360]   True delight is found in you alone.
[00:17:40.360 --> 00:17:43.640]   Your grace, a well too deep to fathom.
[00:17:43.640 --> 00:17:46.560]   Your love exceeds the heavens reach.
[00:17:46.560 --> 00:17:50.120]   Your truth, a fount of perfect wisdom,
[00:17:50.120 --> 00:17:52.720]   my highest good and my unending need."
[00:17:52.720 --> 00:17:55.720]   So as we reflect on and sing the song
[00:17:55.720 --> 00:17:59.520]   that we have nothing to worry about
[00:17:59.520 --> 00:18:02.480]   because God is a rock, he's our foundation,
[00:18:02.480 --> 00:18:03.560]   he's our redeemer.
[00:18:03.560 --> 00:18:11.100]   (upbeat music)

[00:22:02.600 --> 00:22:13.100]   - Before I have you have a seat and greet one another,
[00:22:13.100 --> 00:22:15.100]   I'm gonna ask that as you greet,
[00:22:15.100 --> 00:22:19.100]   you can either do a wave, head nod, or a salute.
[00:22:19.100 --> 00:22:22.100]   So before you have a seat, why don't we greet each other?
[00:22:22.100 --> 00:22:26.100]   (audience cheering)
[00:22:27.100 --> 00:22:30.260]   (audience chattering)
[00:22:30.260 --> 00:22:40.100]   - Good morning, everybody.
[00:22:40.100 --> 00:22:42.100]   Well, it's a blessing to be able to sing
[00:22:42.100 --> 00:22:45.100]   those powerful words and to give our Lord
[00:22:45.100 --> 00:22:47.100]   just some worship together.
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:49.100]   For those of you who are joining us for the very first time,
[00:22:49.100 --> 00:22:51.100]   I wanna welcome you warmly.
[00:22:51.100 --> 00:22:54.100]   After the service is done, please do visit.
[00:22:54.100 --> 00:22:56.100]   Right outside there is a welcome table,
[00:22:56.100 --> 00:22:59.100]   and our welcome team members would love to greet you,
[00:22:59.100 --> 00:23:01.100]   answer some questions that you may have,
[00:23:01.100 --> 00:23:04.100]   and I'll tell you just more about our church.
[00:23:04.100 --> 00:23:06.100]   So please, again, after the service is done,
[00:23:06.100 --> 00:23:07.100]   please stop by.
[00:23:07.100 --> 00:23:11.100]   So as you guys are well aware,
[00:23:11.100 --> 00:23:13.100]   pertaining to what's happening at church,
[00:23:13.100 --> 00:23:17.100]   there are things that have been postponed definitively,
[00:23:17.100 --> 00:23:19.100]   and then there are a lot of things that are tentative.
[00:23:19.100 --> 00:23:22.100]   And so I'll be going over some of those things.
[00:23:22.100 --> 00:23:24.100]   Importantly for today's service,
[00:23:24.100 --> 00:23:27.100]   as we continue to just practice the things
[00:23:27.100 --> 00:23:28.100]   that are recommended,
[00:23:28.100 --> 00:23:30.100]   whether it be the distance, the washing of hands,
[00:23:30.100 --> 00:23:33.100]   there are sanitizer bottles right at the entrance.
[00:23:33.100 --> 00:23:36.100]   Today for offering time, we're going to be having
[00:23:36.100 --> 00:23:38.100]   two ways that you could be doing your offering.
[00:23:38.100 --> 00:23:41.100]   So the first is to submit your offering
[00:23:41.100 --> 00:23:43.100]   via the online format,
[00:23:43.100 --> 00:23:45.100]   and we have various ways that you can do that.
[00:23:45.100 --> 00:23:48.100]   And the second is to come up to the front
[00:23:48.100 --> 00:23:50.100]   at the end of the service when the service is done.
[00:23:50.100 --> 00:23:52.100]   We have two boxes at the front for those of you
[00:23:52.100 --> 00:23:53.100]   who have prepared your checks.
[00:23:53.100 --> 00:23:55.100]   So again, up on the screen,
[00:23:55.100 --> 00:23:58.100]   there are the account information for both Venmo,
[00:23:58.100 --> 00:24:01.100]   that's also the Chase QuickPay there.
[00:24:01.100 --> 00:24:04.100]   And so again, please refer to those things, okay?
[00:24:04.100 --> 00:24:07.100]   Importantly for midweek Bible study,
[00:24:07.100 --> 00:24:10.100]   our Wednesday meeting that we normally have
[00:24:10.100 --> 00:24:12.100]   is going to be moved online.
[00:24:12.100 --> 00:24:14.100]   And so likewise for the home groups,
[00:24:14.100 --> 00:24:17.100]   the recording will happen on Tuesday,
[00:24:17.100 --> 00:24:19.100]   so I'm going to be recording the actual Bible study
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:22.100]   with various questions and preparing a handout
[00:24:22.100 --> 00:24:24.100]   that will be distributed online.
[00:24:24.100 --> 00:24:27.100]   And then the groups and small groups
[00:24:27.100 --> 00:24:30.100]   can choose to meet together if possible,
[00:24:30.100 --> 00:24:32.100]   even in pairs if possible.
[00:24:32.100 --> 00:24:35.100]   But the whole idea is just to continue the efforts
[00:24:35.100 --> 00:24:37.100]   to make sure we're going through Scripture together,
[00:24:37.100 --> 00:24:39.100]   discussing together our reflections
[00:24:39.100 --> 00:24:42.100]   and just our reflections of application as well.
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:44.100]   So please just put forth your best effort
[00:24:44.100 --> 00:24:46.100]   to whether it be to discuss,
[00:24:46.100 --> 00:24:49.100]   again in a much smaller pocket or whatnot,
[00:24:49.100 --> 00:24:53.100]   to again move our Bible study on to the online, okay?
[00:24:53.100 --> 00:24:54.100]   Coming up next Saturday,
[00:24:54.100 --> 00:24:56.100]   we're going to be doing a spring cleaning.
[00:24:56.100 --> 00:24:57.100]   We're very grateful for all of you guys
[00:24:57.100 --> 00:25:00.100]   who showed up yesterday to sanitize the church,
[00:25:00.100 --> 00:25:02.100]   all the door handles, the switches,
[00:25:02.100 --> 00:25:03.100]   they were all wiped down with Lysol,
[00:25:03.100 --> 00:25:05.100]   our cleaning solution.
[00:25:05.100 --> 00:25:07.100]   But we're going to be doing a cleaning next Saturday
[00:25:07.100 --> 00:25:08.100]   and that's going to be held
[00:25:08.100 --> 00:25:10.100]   and we're going to do a second round of that.
[00:25:10.100 --> 00:25:12.100]   In terms of the other events, for example,
[00:25:12.100 --> 00:25:15.100]   there is supposed to be a baptism info session
[00:25:15.100 --> 00:25:16.100]   at the end of the month.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:18.100]   That's going to be postponed.
[00:25:18.100 --> 00:25:20.100]   Likewise, unfortunately, the gospel night
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:22.100]   that was scheduled for April 4th,
[00:25:22.100 --> 00:25:25.100]   that is also being postponed until further notice.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:27.100]   So please continue to stay up to speed
[00:25:27.100 --> 00:25:29.100]   on our various announcements and sites
[00:25:29.100 --> 00:25:32.100]   so that you can know what events are happening.
[00:25:32.100 --> 00:25:33.100]   At this time, Pastor Peter Kim will come
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:35.100]   to deliver us the word.
[00:25:35.100 --> 00:25:40.100]   All right, good morning.
[00:25:40.100 --> 00:25:42.100]   Let me pray for us before we begin.
[00:25:42.100 --> 00:25:47.100]   Heavenly Father, we pray,
[00:25:47.100 --> 00:25:51.100]   especially in these special times
[00:25:51.100 --> 00:25:53.100]   for wisdom and guidance.
[00:25:53.100 --> 00:25:57.100]   Lord, we need to hear your wisdom, your guidance,
[00:25:57.100 --> 00:26:00.100]   your Holy Spirit to lead us in our thinking,
[00:26:00.100 --> 00:26:03.100]   in our feelings, in our lives,
[00:26:03.100 --> 00:26:05.100]   in decision making, especially now.
[00:26:05.100 --> 00:26:07.100]   So we pray, Father, that you would help us
[00:26:07.100 --> 00:26:09.100]   to cut through the clutter in our lives
[00:26:09.100 --> 00:26:13.100]   and to focus our hearts and minds on you and you alone.
[00:26:13.100 --> 00:26:15.100]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:26:15.100 --> 00:26:22.100]   We are very aware that there are probably
[00:26:22.100 --> 00:26:25.100]   more churches closed today than are open.
[00:26:25.100 --> 00:26:27.100]   And I know a handful of churches
[00:26:27.100 --> 00:26:29.100]   that are having services today,
[00:26:29.100 --> 00:26:31.100]   but most of the churches that I'm aware of
[00:26:31.100 --> 00:26:34.100]   have already made a decision to close.
[00:26:34.100 --> 00:26:37.100]   I want to give you some background information
[00:26:37.100 --> 00:26:39.100]   because there's a lot of talk,
[00:26:39.100 --> 00:26:41.100]   a lot of stuff going on online,
[00:26:41.100 --> 00:26:43.100]   just to kind of let you know our thinking process
[00:26:43.100 --> 00:26:45.100]   and what pattern that we're following.
[00:26:45.100 --> 00:26:47.100]   And there is a possibility, again,
[00:26:47.100 --> 00:26:49.100]   because this is progressing pretty quickly,
[00:26:49.100 --> 00:26:51.100]   that we may make a decision, again,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:53.100]   to not have the service next Sunday.
[00:26:53.100 --> 00:26:55.100]   So it's week to week.
[00:26:55.100 --> 00:26:58.100]   So please stay online and check your emails
[00:26:58.100 --> 00:26:59.100]   as often as you can.
[00:26:59.100 --> 00:27:01.100]   If you can put up that...
[00:27:04.100 --> 00:27:07.100]   Okay, so if you don't have Facebook,
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.100]   for whatever the reason, I ask you to get it.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.100]   All right, if you...
[00:27:12.100 --> 00:27:14.100]   But if you... Yeah.
[00:27:14.100 --> 00:27:16.100]   But if you do, I mean, obviously, if you don't have it,
[00:27:16.100 --> 00:27:19.100]   we have emails and smoked snacks.
[00:27:19.100 --> 00:27:21.100]   It's different stuff that we can use to communicate with you.
[00:27:21.100 --> 00:27:23.100]   But those of you who do have Facebook,
[00:27:23.100 --> 00:27:25.100]   you probably saw this already.
[00:27:25.100 --> 00:27:28.100]   And this is the reasoning behind what we're doing.
[00:27:28.100 --> 00:27:31.100]   If you look at it, the first stage...
[00:27:31.100 --> 00:27:33.100]   And again, let me tell you where this is from.
[00:27:33.100 --> 00:27:36.100]   This is from a missionary doctor
[00:27:36.100 --> 00:27:39.100]   who was actually very intimately involved
[00:27:39.100 --> 00:27:41.100]   with the SARS outbreak.
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:43.100]   And he was in Beijing.
[00:27:43.100 --> 00:27:46.100]   And so he was in the context of not only dealing
[00:27:46.100 --> 00:27:48.100]   with the information and the spread of SARS,
[00:27:48.100 --> 00:27:50.100]   but which was, at that time,
[00:27:50.100 --> 00:27:52.100]   was a lot more deadly than what's going on right now,
[00:27:52.100 --> 00:27:54.100]   at least if you did get it.
[00:27:54.100 --> 00:27:57.100]   But to apply that in the church,
[00:27:57.100 --> 00:27:59.100]   like how we ought to respond to that.
[00:27:59.100 --> 00:28:01.100]   And so he made this chart.
[00:28:01.100 --> 00:28:03.100]   And this was, of all the things that I saw,
[00:28:03.100 --> 00:28:05.100]   this was the most helpful.
[00:28:05.100 --> 00:28:07.100]   The first stage was, "There's no cases in my community,"
[00:28:07.100 --> 00:28:09.100]   which is not where we are.
[00:28:09.100 --> 00:28:11.100]   We passed that several weeks ago.
[00:28:11.100 --> 00:28:13.100]   The second stage is, "There are cases in my community,
[00:28:13.100 --> 00:28:16.100]   "but cases are all imported from another area
[00:28:16.100 --> 00:28:19.100]   "or contracts, again, imported from other,"
[00:28:19.100 --> 00:28:22.100]   which means that somebody from the outside who had it
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:24.100]   came into the community,
[00:28:24.100 --> 00:28:26.100]   which was the case until recently.
[00:28:26.100 --> 00:28:29.100]   The third is, "There are one or more cases
[00:28:29.100 --> 00:28:33.100]   "that do not have contacts to a known case,
[00:28:33.100 --> 00:28:35.100]   "multiple generations of transmissions,"
[00:28:35.100 --> 00:28:38.100]   meaning that somebody who contracted it
[00:28:38.100 --> 00:28:40.100]   was independent of somebody that came,
[00:28:40.100 --> 00:28:42.100]   or at least they can't directly connect it,
[00:28:42.100 --> 00:28:44.100]   and there's multiple layers of generations,
[00:28:44.100 --> 00:28:46.100]   that they gave it to somebody,
[00:28:46.100 --> 00:28:48.100]   and then they gave it to somebody else,
[00:28:48.100 --> 00:28:50.100]   and there's generations of this.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:52.100]   The first case that they found of somebody
[00:28:52.100 --> 00:28:55.100]   that they can't trace from outside was found Thursday.
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:57.100]   So meaning that, according to this chart,
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:28:59.100]   we're at not green, not yellow,
[00:28:59.100 --> 00:29:01.100]   but the beginning of the red.
[00:29:01.100 --> 00:29:03.100]   According to all the facts,
[00:29:03.100 --> 00:29:05.100]   most likely this is going to grow exponentially
[00:29:05.100 --> 00:29:07.100]   within the next days or weeks.
[00:29:07.100 --> 00:29:10.100]   So we're not naive to think that this is not going to happen,
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:12.100]   but we are at stage three.
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:14.100]   And so we have moved from stage three
[00:29:14.100 --> 00:29:16.100]   in caution to stage four,
[00:29:16.100 --> 00:29:18.100]   which is what we're doing right now.
[00:29:18.100 --> 00:29:20.100]   We are asking people to take precautions.
[00:29:20.100 --> 00:29:22.100]   The Bible studies that, again, you know,
[00:29:22.100 --> 00:29:25.100]   that we're going to try to go online as much as possible
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.100]   and distance ourselves, sanitize everything,
[00:29:27.100 --> 00:29:29.100]   giving instructions.
[00:29:29.100 --> 00:29:31.100]   We're doing everything that we can.
[00:29:31.100 --> 00:29:35.100]   And then if by chance that this does progress,
[00:29:35.100 --> 00:29:37.100]   we need to go to stage five,
[00:29:37.100 --> 00:29:39.100]   which is basically shut down everything,
[00:29:39.100 --> 00:29:41.100]   everything's going online, right?
[00:29:41.100 --> 00:29:43.100]   We will give that information
[00:29:43.100 --> 00:29:45.100]   as soon as we feel the need to do that.
[00:29:45.100 --> 00:29:47.100]   The question is,
[00:29:47.100 --> 00:29:50.100]   why didn't we just completely go online to begin with?
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.100]   Why didn't we go from stage one to stage five
[00:29:53.100 --> 00:29:55.100]   just out of precaution?
[00:29:55.100 --> 00:29:58.100]   Because there are more things to consider
[00:29:58.100 --> 00:30:01.100]   than just our safety.
[00:30:01.100 --> 00:30:04.100]   According to Orange County Health,
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:08.100]   not what's going on in Wuhan and Italy and even San Francisco,
[00:30:08.100 --> 00:30:12.100]   but according to Orange County Health Organization,
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:16.100]   they say that our risk at this time today is pretty low.
[00:30:16.100 --> 00:30:18.100]   The number of people who have contracted it
[00:30:18.100 --> 00:30:21.100]   versus the number of people who live in Orange County
[00:30:21.100 --> 00:30:24.100]   is 1 to 500,000.
[00:30:24.100 --> 00:30:26.100]   Obviously that number is going to grow.
[00:30:26.100 --> 00:30:29.100]   So we need to be careful that we are not panicking,
[00:30:29.100 --> 00:30:32.100]   that we highly value the gathering of the people,
[00:30:32.100 --> 00:30:37.100]   that we are not just reacting to the information that we are hearing,
[00:30:37.100 --> 00:30:40.100]   and we are not naive to think that,
[00:30:40.100 --> 00:30:43.100]   "Oh, this is nothing. It's like a common flu
[00:30:43.100 --> 00:30:45.100]   and that we're kind of treating it like it's nothing."
[00:30:45.100 --> 00:30:47.100]   That is not the case.
[00:30:47.100 --> 00:30:51.100]   Our believers are in communication as often as we can,
[00:30:51.100 --> 00:30:53.100]   multiple times during the day,
[00:30:53.100 --> 00:30:55.100]   every information that we get,
[00:30:55.100 --> 00:30:58.100]   every article that is sent to us, we read it thoroughly,
[00:30:58.100 --> 00:31:00.100]   and we are examining carefully,
[00:31:00.100 --> 00:31:03.100]   how do we balance between the high call of the gathering of the believers
[00:31:03.100 --> 00:31:06.100]   with what's going on around us?
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.100]   Again, as it progresses, we will let you know.
[00:31:10.100 --> 00:31:12.100]   But those of you who are sitting in these seats,
[00:31:12.100 --> 00:31:15.100]   these seats are interlocked for a reason.
[00:31:15.100 --> 00:31:17.100]   When our church was being built,
[00:31:17.100 --> 00:31:19.100]   the fire department came in.
[00:31:19.100 --> 00:31:23.100]   One of the requirements were that the aisles needed to be a certain size,
[00:31:23.100 --> 00:31:26.100]   a distance,
[00:31:26.100 --> 00:31:29.100]   and every seat in the sanctuary had to have a certain distance
[00:31:29.100 --> 00:31:31.100]   to an exit that goes directly outside.
[00:31:31.100 --> 00:31:34.100]   So they had all these rules that we had to follow.
[00:31:34.100 --> 00:31:36.100]   I was able to understand all of that,
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:38.100]   except for the interlocking of the chairs.
[00:31:38.100 --> 00:31:40.100]   I said, "If there's an emergency,
[00:31:40.100 --> 00:31:42.100]   wouldn't it be easier if the chairs didn't interlock,
[00:31:42.100 --> 00:31:46.100]   and we're able to immediately move it, and everybody can run?"
[00:31:46.100 --> 00:31:49.100]   And he said, "That's exactly the reason why they need to interlock,
[00:31:49.100 --> 00:31:52.100]   because according to their experience,
[00:31:52.100 --> 00:31:55.100]   when fire breaks out, people panic.
[00:31:55.100 --> 00:31:58.100]   And when they panic, they don't act irrationally.
[00:31:58.100 --> 00:32:01.100]   So they end up jumping over chairs.
[00:32:01.100 --> 00:32:04.100]   They're not going to get in a neat line and then march their way outside.
[00:32:04.100 --> 00:32:08.100]   So they're going to be pushing themselves and trying to get over the chairs.
[00:32:08.100 --> 00:32:10.100]   And in that process, what ends up happening
[00:32:10.100 --> 00:32:13.100]   is all the chairs that fall down, and it blocks the entrances,
[00:32:13.100 --> 00:32:19.100]   and more people die from the stampede than they do from the fire itself.
[00:32:19.100 --> 00:32:22.100]   That's natural human behavior.
[00:32:22.100 --> 00:32:25.100]   And so we're trying to be careful
[00:32:25.100 --> 00:32:29.100]   that we are not reacting to all the information that we are hearing.
[00:32:29.100 --> 00:32:31.100]   According to what we have heard,
[00:32:31.100 --> 00:32:36.100]   that it's still a low risk that's most likely going to move to a higher risk.
[00:32:36.100 --> 00:32:38.100]   If you go to Costco, it is still open.
[00:32:38.100 --> 00:32:40.100]   The City Hall is still open.
[00:32:40.100 --> 00:32:43.100]   Most of the restaurants are still open.
[00:32:43.100 --> 00:32:45.100]   And so Disneyland just closed.
[00:32:45.100 --> 00:32:48.100]   From what I heard yesterday, it closed.
[00:32:48.100 --> 00:32:50.100]   So slowly we are getting there,
[00:32:50.100 --> 00:32:56.100]   but we didn't want to overreact and go from level 2 to level 5
[00:32:56.100 --> 00:32:59.100]   because we wanted to make sure that we highly value
[00:32:59.100 --> 00:33:01.100]   what it is that you and I are doing.
[00:33:01.100 --> 00:33:05.100]   So we made it an option to have the families with small children
[00:33:05.100 --> 00:33:09.100]   go to the park, and we wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:09.100 --> 00:33:11.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:11.100 --> 00:33:13.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:13.100 --> 00:33:15.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:15.100 --> 00:33:17.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:17.100 --> 00:33:19.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:19.100 --> 00:33:21.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:21.100 --> 00:33:23.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:23.100 --> 00:33:25.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:25.100 --> 00:33:27.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:27.100 --> 00:33:29.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:29.100 --> 00:33:31.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:31.100 --> 00:33:33.100]   We wanted to make sure that they were safe.
[00:33:33.100 --> 00:33:35.100]   And all the stuff that we can't even do that,
[00:33:35.100 --> 00:33:37.100]   we will cancel for the time being.
[00:33:37.100 --> 00:33:39.100]   We don't know how long this is going to take.
[00:33:39.100 --> 00:33:42.100]   It might take a month. It might take two months.
[00:33:42.100 --> 00:33:46.100]   But my guess is in about a month, we will be much worse off than we are today.
[00:33:46.100 --> 00:33:50.100]   So our concern is if we go too quickly to the end part,
[00:33:50.100 --> 00:33:55.100]   we're going to be at that point from possibly two months, three months, four months, and on.
[00:33:55.100 --> 00:33:58.100]   And so we want to be careful that we are taking proper steps,
[00:33:58.100 --> 00:34:01.100]   that we are not reacting to what's going on around us.
[00:34:01.100 --> 00:34:08.100]   There is tremendous pressure on all of us in the leadership to follow the herd and go.
[00:34:08.100 --> 00:34:12.100]   But we want to make sure that we are communicating properly.
[00:34:12.100 --> 00:34:19.100]   I want to start off by looking at this text in Mark 4, 35-41.
[00:34:19.100 --> 00:34:23.100]   I'm going to be giving an overview of the book of Hebrews.
[00:34:23.100 --> 00:34:25.100]   And I told you that we're at chapter 7.
[00:34:25.100 --> 00:34:27.100]   We're going to be talking about Melchizedek.
[00:34:27.100 --> 00:34:31.100]   But I'm not sure if I'm going to be getting to the Melchizedek next week.
[00:34:31.100 --> 00:34:36.100]   And the reason why is because there are many people at home with their children having service together.
[00:34:36.100 --> 00:34:40.100]   And my guess is they have no idea who Melchizedek is, right?
[00:34:40.100 --> 00:34:44.100]   Unless you've done a fantastic job,
[00:34:44.100 --> 00:34:49.100]   and they want to know the intricacies of the Trinity and Melchizedek, like, right away.
[00:34:49.100 --> 00:34:52.100]   But my guess is most of your children will not be.
[00:34:52.100 --> 00:34:57.100]   So because we want to be sensitive to the families at our home watching the videos together,
[00:34:57.100 --> 00:35:02.100]   that hopefully our services will be, you know, like, it'll be relevant to them as well.
[00:35:02.100 --> 00:35:04.100]   So we want to be sensitive to that.
[00:35:04.100 --> 00:35:07.100]   No guarantee. We could still be jumping into Melchizedek.
[00:35:07.100 --> 00:35:13.100]   But again, we might just wait a few more weeks, and we'll see how things go.
[00:35:13.100 --> 00:35:15.100]   Mark 4, 35.
[00:35:15.100 --> 00:35:21.100]   This is the scene where the disciples and Jesus are on the Sea of Galilee.
[00:35:21.100 --> 00:35:25.100]   And Jesus is so fatigued and tired that he falls asleep on this boat.
[00:35:25.100 --> 00:35:31.100]   And while he is on the boat, a tremendous storm comes, and they freak out, right?
[00:35:31.100 --> 00:35:33.100]   But I want to go over the text with you.
[00:35:33.100 --> 00:35:35.100]   It's verse 35.
[00:35:35.100 --> 00:35:37.100]   [reading]
[00:35:37.100 --> 00:35:52.100]   [reading]
[00:35:52.100 --> 00:35:55.100]   Let me stop right there.
[00:35:55.100 --> 00:36:01.100]   Before we jump to conclusion that these disciples are weak and that they were fearful,
[00:36:01.100 --> 00:36:05.100]   you have to realize that this is happening at the Sea of Galilee.
[00:36:05.100 --> 00:36:11.100]   The Sea of Galilee is where Paul, John, Andrew, you know, those four brothers,
[00:36:11.100 --> 00:36:13.100]   this is their hometown.
[00:36:13.100 --> 00:36:15.100]   They're professional fishermen.
[00:36:15.100 --> 00:36:19.100]   And at that time, professional fishermen usually were inherited.
[00:36:19.100 --> 00:36:23.100]   Their job was usually inherited by their parents, probably maybe their grandparents.
[00:36:23.100 --> 00:36:25.100]   I don't know how many generations it goes.
[00:36:25.100 --> 00:36:28.100]   But these guys are lifelong fishermen.
[00:36:28.100 --> 00:36:33.100]   And the Sea of Galilee is where they did most of their work.
[00:36:33.100 --> 00:36:39.100]   So the fact that the storm came in and that they were afraid because the water was coming into the boat,
[00:36:39.100 --> 00:36:43.100]   it is understandable that they are freaking out.
[00:36:43.100 --> 00:36:47.100]   Because if anybody would know if this storm was going to lead to death or not,
[00:36:47.100 --> 00:36:49.100]   it would have been them.
[00:36:49.100 --> 00:36:52.100]   So the fact that they were freaking out and they were scared,
[00:36:52.100 --> 00:36:59.100]   and they looked to Jesus, who happens to be sleeping at the end, at the stern.
[00:36:59.100 --> 00:37:03.100]   The stern is basically at the end of the boat.
[00:37:03.100 --> 00:37:07.100]   And most likely in a small boat, that's where the rudder was.
[00:37:07.100 --> 00:37:13.100]   The boat, traditionally at that time, they said it's about probably about 30 feet and about 7 1/2 feet wide.
[00:37:13.100 --> 00:37:16.100]   So it wasn't a huge boat, just enough to fit the disciples and Jesus.
[00:37:16.100 --> 00:37:21.100]   And Jesus, in the midst of the storm, is sitting back there, and he's sleeping.
[00:37:21.100 --> 00:37:26.100]   And they're freaking out, and they go to Jesus, "Jesus, how can you do this?"
[00:37:26.100 --> 00:37:30.100]   Again, verse 38, "Jesus himself was in the stern, asleep in the cushion.
[00:37:30.100 --> 00:37:36.100]   And they woke him and said to him, 'Teacher, do you not care that we are perishing?'"
[00:37:36.100 --> 00:37:38.100]   Now they are saying this for two reasons.
[00:37:38.100 --> 00:37:41.100]   One, because Jesus is their leader.
[00:37:41.100 --> 00:37:46.100]   So they're asking their leader, "How can you be sleeping while we might die?"
[00:37:46.100 --> 00:37:48.100]   But the other reason is Jesus is at the stern.
[00:37:48.100 --> 00:37:51.100]   He may have been in control of the rudder.
[00:37:51.100 --> 00:37:55.100]   "What are you doing? We're about to die."
[00:37:55.100 --> 00:38:01.100]   But when Jesus wakes up from this, I mean, there isn't a meeting.
[00:38:01.100 --> 00:38:03.100]   There isn't like a teaching.
[00:38:03.100 --> 00:38:05.100]   He just gets up, and he says, "Hush!"
[00:38:05.100 --> 00:38:09.100]   Verse 39, "He rebuked the wind, and he said to the sea, 'Hush, be still.'
[00:38:09.100 --> 00:38:13.100]   And the wind died down, and it became perfectly calm."
[00:38:13.100 --> 00:38:16.100]   So there was no work being done.
[00:38:16.100 --> 00:38:21.100]   All Jesus did was, done! Instantaneously gone.
[00:38:21.100 --> 00:38:26.100]   Instead of apologizing to the disciples, "Oh, I was so tired."
[00:38:26.100 --> 00:38:33.100]   I mean, imagine how tired Jesus was that in the midst of a storm that may cause him to drown,
[00:38:33.100 --> 00:38:36.100]   and everybody else is freaking out, and Jesus is tired.
[00:38:36.100 --> 00:38:39.100]   That's how human he was.
[00:38:39.100 --> 00:38:40.100]   That's what his ministry looked like.
[00:38:40.100 --> 00:38:43.100]   We get a glimpse into his humanity.
[00:38:43.100 --> 00:38:49.100]   But instead of apologizing, he turns the table around, and he says, "Why are you afraid?
[00:38:49.100 --> 00:38:52.100]   Do you still have no faith?"
[00:38:52.100 --> 00:38:58.100]   Now again, humanly speaking, who wouldn't be afraid?
[00:38:58.100 --> 00:39:05.100]   I mean, these are professional fishermen in the Sea of Galilee, in their own boat.
[00:39:05.100 --> 00:39:08.100]   They know what they can handle, what they cannot handle.
[00:39:08.100 --> 00:39:13.100]   Clearly, this was a danger that they needed to deal with.
[00:39:13.100 --> 00:39:19.100]   But instead, Jesus says, "Why are you afraid?"
[00:39:19.100 --> 00:39:23.100]   Verse 41 says, "They became very much afraid and said to one another,
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:28.100]   'Who then is this that even the wind and the sea obey him?'"
[00:39:28.100 --> 00:39:36.100]   See, what we see here, and the reason why he turns it around and says to them,
[00:39:36.100 --> 00:39:40.100]   and rebukes them, "Why were you afraid? Do you not have faith?"
[00:39:40.100 --> 00:39:46.100]   What he was asking was, "Do you not recognize who is at the rudder?"
[00:39:46.100 --> 00:39:51.100]   The problem was not the storm. The problem was not them. The problem was not the boat.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:56.100]   This was no ordinary storm. This was no ordinary leader sitting at the rudder.
[00:39:56.100 --> 00:39:59.100]   So what they were questioning, and what he was asking was,
[00:39:59.100 --> 00:40:03.100]   "In the midst of all of this, do you not know who I am?"
[00:40:03.100 --> 00:40:05.100]   That's what he was asking.
[00:40:05.100 --> 00:40:09.100]   The difference between this storm, the difference between this danger,
[00:40:09.100 --> 00:40:12.100]   is that Jesus was in control.
[00:40:12.100 --> 00:40:17.100]   And that's why he turned the tables and he rebuked them.
[00:40:17.100 --> 00:40:21.100]   Now, you know, when we're living in a time of peace,
[00:40:21.100 --> 00:40:26.100]   you know, we can imagine, right? But the world is freaking out right now.
[00:40:26.100 --> 00:40:33.100]   I mean, there's all kinds of news. I mean, obviously, we have two very extreme responses,
[00:40:33.100 --> 00:40:35.100]   and less and less people are responding on one end.
[00:40:35.100 --> 00:40:39.100]   We have one end that if we change anything, we're foolish.
[00:40:39.100 --> 00:40:41.100]   And I think less and less people feel that way.
[00:40:41.100 --> 00:40:47.100]   But we have a growing number of people that think that we're in the midst of Armageddon.
[00:40:47.100 --> 00:40:50.100]   That if we don't stockpile seven years of toilet paper,
[00:40:50.100 --> 00:40:54.100]   that you don't get enough Purell for the rest of your life,
[00:40:54.100 --> 00:41:01.100]   that you're never going to survive. We have that end.
[00:41:01.100 --> 00:41:05.100]   We have to be careful that in the midst, especially in the midst of turmoil,
[00:41:05.100 --> 00:41:09.100]   that we don't react like the rest of the world.
[00:41:09.100 --> 00:41:15.100]   Because our greatest fear should not be catching this disease.
[00:41:15.100 --> 00:41:21.100]   Our greatest fear should not be if you caught it, that you're going to die from it.
[00:41:21.100 --> 00:41:24.100]   If you notice that when Jesus wakes up and he calms the storm,
[00:41:24.100 --> 00:41:32.100]   the tremendous fear that they had of this storm turned into fear of who?
[00:41:32.100 --> 00:41:35.100]   Of Christ. Fear of God.
[00:41:35.100 --> 00:41:40.100]   And the Bible says that beginning of wisdom is fear of the Lord.
[00:41:40.100 --> 00:41:42.100]   Beginning of wisdom.
[00:41:42.100 --> 00:41:46.100]   We want to be wise. We want to be careful.
[00:41:46.100 --> 00:41:48.100]   We don't want to be naive.
[00:41:48.100 --> 00:41:51.100]   We want to take what's happening around the world.
[00:41:51.100 --> 00:41:55.100]   But we want to be wise in making sure that the fear of the Lord
[00:41:55.100 --> 00:42:01.100]   is the foundation upon which we are building and which we are making decisions.
[00:42:01.100 --> 00:42:07.100]   The book of Hebrews is written to a group of people who are in dire situation.
[00:42:07.100 --> 00:42:11.100]   It was written around 65 to 69 AD.
[00:42:11.100 --> 00:42:14.100]   Some of you guys who know Roman history know that the Christian persecution
[00:42:14.100 --> 00:42:16.100]   happened right around that time.
[00:42:16.100 --> 00:42:19.100]   All those things that you see on movies where Christians are taken to Colosseum
[00:42:19.100 --> 00:42:23.100]   and lions are tearing them apart.
[00:42:23.100 --> 00:42:27.100]   This happened during that period, 65 to 69 AD.
[00:42:27.100 --> 00:42:29.100]   If you were with us in the study of the book of Romans,
[00:42:29.100 --> 00:42:34.100]   you know that Paul was captured in Jerusalem in AD 59.
[00:42:34.100 --> 00:42:39.100]   He was in Jerusalem for two years, and then he was taken to Rome as a prisoner
[00:42:39.100 --> 00:42:43.100]   between AD 61 to AD 63.
[00:42:43.100 --> 00:42:49.100]   Meaning for that period of time, the Romans were the ones who were guarding Paul.
[00:42:49.100 --> 00:42:51.100]   Do you remember that?
[00:42:51.100 --> 00:42:55.100]   Paul came into Jerusalem to preach the gospel, and the Jews were so angered
[00:42:55.100 --> 00:42:57.100]   they wanted to stone him to death.
[00:42:57.100 --> 00:43:01.100]   It was the Roman guards that came in to protect him.
[00:43:01.100 --> 00:43:05.100]   And under their protection, he was under house arrest,
[00:43:05.100 --> 00:43:07.100]   and his friends were able to come.
[00:43:07.100 --> 00:43:10.100]   He was writing letters, and he was preaching the gospel.
[00:43:10.100 --> 00:43:13.100]   Do you remember as he was writing the book of Philippians,
[00:43:13.100 --> 00:43:16.100]   he says, "This has turned out for the spreading of the gospel."
[00:43:16.100 --> 00:43:20.100]   Other people are more emboldened because of his chains.
[00:43:20.100 --> 00:43:25.100]   But that was between AD 59 to AD 63.
[00:43:25.100 --> 00:43:31.100]   What these believers are experiencing now was much different.
[00:43:31.100 --> 00:43:36.100]   In fact, when the persecution initially came, they were very strong,
[00:43:36.100 --> 00:43:39.100]   just like in the book of Philippians.
[00:43:39.100 --> 00:43:43.100]   They were more emboldened to preach the gospel because the Romans were actually protecting them.
[00:43:43.100 --> 00:43:49.100]   But by the time Paul writes 2 Timothy, the atmosphere has changed.
[00:43:49.100 --> 00:43:52.100]   The Nero's persecution had become intense.
[00:43:52.100 --> 00:43:56.100]   And that's the background behind the writing of the book of Hebrews.
[00:43:56.100 --> 00:44:03.100]   In fact, Tacitus--if you can put up the next section--Tacitus, who is a Roman official,
[00:44:03.100 --> 00:44:08.100]   and he's one of the most revered Roman historians, who was not a Christian.
[00:44:08.100 --> 00:44:11.100]   He was a contemporary of the emperor Nero,
[00:44:11.100 --> 00:44:15.100]   and he was writing his observation of what was going on with the Christians.
[00:44:15.100 --> 00:44:18.100]   And this gives us insight as to the intensity of the persecution
[00:44:18.100 --> 00:44:22.100]   that these Roman Christians were experiencing at this time.
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:28.100]   He says, "Yet no human effort, no princely largesse, nor offerings of the gods
[00:44:28.100 --> 00:44:33.100]   could make that infamous rumor disappear that Nero had somehow ordered the fire."
[00:44:33.100 --> 00:44:37.100]   There was a big fire that broke out in Rome, and in order to escape blame,
[00:44:37.100 --> 00:44:39.100]   he said that the Christians did it.
[00:44:39.100 --> 00:44:44.100]   And so Tacitus already was suspecting that maybe Nero did it himself.
[00:44:44.100 --> 00:44:48.100]   Therefore, in order to abolish that rumor, Nero falsely accused and executed
[00:44:48.100 --> 00:44:52.100]   with the most exquisite punishment those people called Christians,
[00:44:52.100 --> 00:44:55.100]   who were infamous for their abominations.
[00:44:55.100 --> 00:44:58.100]   The originator of the name, Christ, was executed as a criminal
[00:44:58.100 --> 00:45:02.100]   by procurator Pontius Pilate during the reign of Tiberius.
[00:45:02.100 --> 00:45:06.100]   And though repressed, this destructive superstition erupted again,
[00:45:06.100 --> 00:45:10.100]   not only through Judea, which was the origin of this evil,
[00:45:10.100 --> 00:45:13.100]   but also through the city of Rome, to which all that is horrible
[00:45:13.100 --> 00:45:16.100]   and shameful floods together and is celebrated.
[00:45:16.100 --> 00:45:20.100]   In other words, Tacitus is already saying that if any horrible things
[00:45:20.100 --> 00:45:24.100]   are going to happen, it would happen in Rome, because they have a reputation for this.
[00:45:24.100 --> 00:45:29.100]   Therefore, first, those were seized who admitted their faith.
[00:45:29.100 --> 00:45:31.100]   Let me stop right there.
[00:45:31.100 --> 00:45:34.100]   He's describing the persecution, and he said the first group of people
[00:45:34.100 --> 00:45:38.100]   were people who are openly sharing their faith.
[00:45:38.100 --> 00:45:41.100]   That's usually how persecution begins.
[00:45:41.100 --> 00:45:46.100]   If you stay quiet, stay in your house, and you're not outside doing God's work,
[00:45:46.100 --> 00:45:48.100]   there is no need for persecution.
[00:45:48.100 --> 00:45:51.100]   So the first group of people were most likely missionaries
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.100]   who were outside sharing their faith, and he says they were the ones
[00:45:55.100 --> 00:46:00.100]   who were first seized, and then using the information they provided,
[00:46:00.100 --> 00:46:04.100]   a vast multitude were convicted.
[00:46:04.100 --> 00:46:07.100]   So right now, all the missionaries out in China who's been there
[00:46:07.100 --> 00:46:11.100]   for five to ten years, they're the ones who are in greatest danger,
[00:46:11.100 --> 00:46:15.100]   and they are being protected because once they get in and they get interrogated,
[00:46:15.100 --> 00:46:18.100]   they're concerned that they're going to end up finding other people
[00:46:18.100 --> 00:46:20.100]   that are connected to them.
[00:46:20.100 --> 00:46:22.100]   So that's exactly how persecution works.
[00:46:22.100 --> 00:46:25.100]   That's what's going on in China and different parts of the world.
[00:46:25.100 --> 00:46:29.100]   And he says the first intense persecution happened the same way.
[00:46:29.100 --> 00:46:32.100]   It was through the people who are openly admitting their faith.
[00:46:32.100 --> 00:46:35.100]   They used the information they provided, and they went after the people
[00:46:35.100 --> 00:46:37.100]   who were connected to them.
[00:46:37.100 --> 00:46:43.100]   Not so much for the crime of burning the city, but for hatred of human race.
[00:46:43.100 --> 00:46:47.100]   And perishing, they were additionally made into sports.
[00:46:47.100 --> 00:46:52.100]   Their persecution was made an entertainment to the Romans.
[00:46:52.100 --> 00:46:56.100]   They were killed by dogs by having the hides of beasts attached to them,
[00:46:56.100 --> 00:47:00.100]   or they were nailed to crosses or set aflame.
[00:47:00.100 --> 00:47:04.100]   And when the daylight passed away, they were used as nighttime lamps.
[00:47:04.100 --> 00:47:07.100]   Let me stop right there.
[00:47:07.100 --> 00:47:11.100]   They made the persecution an entertainment for the Roman citizens.
[00:47:11.100 --> 00:47:15.100]   They would crucify them, allow dogs and beasts to tear them apart,
[00:47:15.100 --> 00:47:18.100]   and people would pay money to come and see this.
[00:47:18.100 --> 00:47:21.100]   And then when they were crucified, they would set them aflame,
[00:47:21.100 --> 00:47:24.100]   and not only did they die because of this,
[00:47:24.100 --> 00:47:29.100]   Nero decided that he was going to light his garden
[00:47:29.100 --> 00:47:31.100]   with these people who are burning.
[00:47:31.100 --> 00:47:33.100]   This is how ridiculous.
[00:47:33.100 --> 00:47:36.100]   This is the background behind the Letter or Book of Hebrews.
[00:47:36.100 --> 00:47:40.100]   And when the daylight passed away, they were used as nighttime lamps.
[00:47:40.100 --> 00:47:44.100]   Nero gave his own gardens for his spectacle and performed a circus game.
[00:47:44.100 --> 00:47:50.100]   In the habit of charioteer, mixing with the plebes or driving about the race course.
[00:47:50.100 --> 00:47:53.100]   Even though they were clearly guilty and merited being made
[00:47:53.100 --> 00:47:56.100]   the most recent example of consequences of crime,
[00:47:56.100 --> 00:47:59.100]   people began to pity these sufferers.
[00:47:59.100 --> 00:48:02.100]   Part of the reason why revival broke out in the first century
[00:48:02.100 --> 00:48:05.100]   is because the sentiment toward the Christians began to change
[00:48:05.100 --> 00:48:10.100]   because the Romans were so cruel to the Christians.
[00:48:10.100 --> 00:48:12.100]   Because they were consumed not for public good,
[00:48:12.100 --> 00:48:14.100]   but on account of the fierceness of one man.
[00:48:14.100 --> 00:48:17.100]   Again, it's an indictment against Nero.
[00:48:17.100 --> 00:48:20.100]   That gives us a background behind what was historically being observed
[00:48:20.100 --> 00:48:23.100]   by even other Romans.
[00:48:23.100 --> 00:48:27.100]   That's the background behind the Book of Hebrews.
[00:48:27.100 --> 00:48:31.100]   So when he tells them, the author of Hebrews tells them,
[00:48:31.100 --> 00:48:34.100]   "Do not neglect gathering together."
[00:48:34.100 --> 00:48:36.100]   That was the background.
[00:48:36.100 --> 00:48:39.100]   Now, our present circumstance is not the same.
[00:48:39.100 --> 00:48:41.100]   And I'm not making that connection.
[00:48:41.100 --> 00:48:46.100]   Because the churches are not shutting down for that reason.
[00:48:46.100 --> 00:48:49.100]   It's for safety reasons, making sure that the virus does not spread.
[00:48:49.100 --> 00:48:55.100]   But we want to make sure that whatever decision that we make,
[00:48:55.100 --> 00:48:59.100]   that we place the high value of gathering together
[00:48:59.100 --> 00:49:02.100]   for those who are able to come.
[00:49:02.100 --> 00:49:04.100]   That we want to make sure that when it is necessary,
[00:49:04.100 --> 00:49:07.100]   which it seems like we are headed toward that direction,
[00:49:07.100 --> 00:49:11.100]   that when that decision is made, that there is no confusion,
[00:49:11.100 --> 00:49:14.100]   the high priority of what we are doing.
[00:49:14.100 --> 00:49:17.100]   Because even the government has the warning that they gave was
[00:49:17.100 --> 00:49:20.100]   250 people or more.
[00:49:20.100 --> 00:49:23.100]   That is not essential.
[00:49:23.100 --> 00:49:27.100]   And we consider the gathering of the believers essential.
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:33.100]   That the closing of Disneyland should not equate to what we are doing.
[00:49:33.100 --> 00:49:36.100]   Again, we are headed there.
[00:49:36.100 --> 00:49:39.100]   And maybe as early as this week, we may have to do so.
[00:49:39.100 --> 00:49:43.100]   Because we want to abide by the government and what is happening around us.
[00:49:43.100 --> 00:49:45.100]   But we don't want to panic.
[00:49:45.100 --> 00:49:47.100]   We don't want to knock over chairs.
[00:49:47.100 --> 00:49:50.100]   We don't want people to go to supermarkets and buy stuff
[00:49:50.100 --> 00:49:53.100]   that the elderly is in need of.
[00:49:53.100 --> 00:49:56.100]   We want to make sure that we are being prayerful,
[00:49:56.100 --> 00:49:58.100]   that we are anchored in Christ,
[00:49:58.100 --> 00:50:01.100]   that at the end of all of this, whether it's two months, three months,
[00:50:01.100 --> 00:50:09.100]   or five months from now, that our values are going to stay intact.
[00:50:09.100 --> 00:50:13.100]   It was written.
[00:50:13.100 --> 00:50:15.100]   This letter was written, and he says,
[00:50:15.100 --> 00:50:19.100]   the letter itself describes them, Hebrews 10.32,
[00:50:19.100 --> 00:50:22.100]   "But remember the former days when after being enlightened,
[00:50:22.100 --> 00:50:24.100]   you endured a great conflict of suffering,
[00:50:24.100 --> 00:50:28.100]   partly by being made a public spectacle through reproaches and tribulations,
[00:50:28.100 --> 00:50:31.100]   and partly by becoming shares with those who were so treated.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.100]   For you showed sympathy to the prisoners and accepted joyfully
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:37.100]   the seizure of your property."
[00:50:37.100 --> 00:50:40.100]   If this was written by Paul, he may be referring to them coming
[00:50:40.100 --> 00:50:43.100]   and visiting Paul, giving him stuff, giving gifts.
[00:50:43.100 --> 00:50:47.100]   Even if it wasn't written by Paul, Paul says that this group
[00:50:47.100 --> 00:50:49.100]   was a very good group.
[00:50:49.100 --> 00:50:54.100]   They were committed Christians, but when the heat got turned up,
[00:50:54.100 --> 00:50:57.100]   they began to run.
[00:50:57.100 --> 00:51:01.100]   So he is reminding them, the whole letter is reminding them,
[00:51:01.100 --> 00:51:05.100]   in the midst of this intense situation,
[00:51:05.100 --> 00:51:10.100]   to make sure that you are anchored in Christ.
[00:51:10.100 --> 00:51:13.100]   We need to be anchored in Christ in every situation,
[00:51:13.100 --> 00:51:15.100]   whether it is in peace, whether it's in turmoil,
[00:51:15.100 --> 00:51:20.100]   but especially in times when we are surrounded by people
[00:51:20.100 --> 00:51:25.100]   who are in dire need of security,
[00:51:25.100 --> 00:51:27.100]   that we do not act like the world,
[00:51:27.100 --> 00:51:31.100]   that our security doesn't come from having a stockpile of Purell
[00:51:31.100 --> 00:51:33.100]   in our garage,
[00:51:33.100 --> 00:51:35.100]   that if we just keep the distance from everybody,
[00:51:35.100 --> 00:51:40.100]   if we just don't get the coronavirus, we are safe.
[00:51:40.100 --> 00:51:42.100]   That is not our safety.
[00:51:42.100 --> 00:51:44.100]   That is not our hope.
[00:51:44.100 --> 00:51:46.100]   That is not our peace.
[00:51:46.100 --> 00:51:50.100]   We need to do everything that we should do as good citizens,
[00:51:50.100 --> 00:51:52.100]   as good neighbors, to love the people around us,
[00:51:52.100 --> 00:51:56.100]   to submit to the authority.
[00:51:56.100 --> 00:52:00.100]   But our greatest hope is always in Christ.
[00:52:00.100 --> 00:52:05.100]   If there's any time where that needs to be emphasized, it is now.
[00:52:05.100 --> 00:52:09.100]   Are we anchored in Christ as a church?
[00:52:09.100 --> 00:52:11.100]   Are we anchored in Christ in our homes?
[00:52:11.100 --> 00:52:13.100]   Are we anchored in Christ individually?
[00:52:13.100 --> 00:52:15.100]   Are we anchored in Christ in our friendship?
[00:52:15.100 --> 00:52:20.100]   Are we anchored in Christ in the way we treat our neighbors?
[00:52:20.100 --> 00:52:26.100]   While it is our natural instinct to be concerned over ourselves and our children,
[00:52:26.100 --> 00:52:31.100]   is the anchoring of Christ causing us to act differently than the world?
[00:52:31.100 --> 00:52:34.100]   The author constantly encourages us all throughout the book of Hebrews
[00:52:34.100 --> 00:52:37.100]   to not to drift, to be anchored in Christ.
[00:52:37.100 --> 00:52:42.100]   Hebrews 2, verse 1, "For this reason, we must pay much closer attention
[00:52:42.100 --> 00:52:44.100]   to what we have heard."
[00:52:44.100 --> 00:52:46.100]   Why do we need to pay much closer attention?
[00:52:46.100 --> 00:52:48.100]   Because of what was going on.
[00:52:48.100 --> 00:52:52.100]   Because of the persecution, because of the threat of death.
[00:52:52.100 --> 00:52:57.100]   So you were paying attention, but now you must pay much closer attention.
[00:52:57.100 --> 00:53:00.100]   Christ was always important to us.
[00:53:00.100 --> 00:53:02.100]   He was always our foundation.
[00:53:02.100 --> 00:53:06.100]   The gospel was always precious, but much more now.
[00:53:06.100 --> 00:53:09.100]   He says, "Much more now, pay much closer attention to what you have heard
[00:53:09.100 --> 00:53:13.100]   so that we do not drift away from it."
[00:53:13.100 --> 00:53:16.100]   How is the gospel that we profess?
[00:53:16.100 --> 00:53:20.100]   How are the values that we profess, the heaven that we talk about
[00:53:20.100 --> 00:53:23.100]   that we're going to go to, that we're eagerly waiting for?
[00:53:23.100 --> 00:53:26.100]   Out of all of that information that we profess,
[00:53:26.100 --> 00:53:29.100]   how does it affect the way that we make decisions?
[00:53:29.100 --> 00:53:36.100]   The way we treat our neighbors, what we do in the midst of all of this?
[00:53:36.100 --> 00:53:41.100]   Hebrews 2, 3, "How will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?"
[00:53:41.100 --> 00:53:43.100]   You know what he means by neglect?
[00:53:43.100 --> 00:53:45.100]   Neglect can happen in two ways.
[00:53:45.100 --> 00:53:48.100]   One, simply by doing nothing, just sit on the boat
[00:53:48.100 --> 00:53:50.100]   and take the boat wherever it goes.
[00:53:50.100 --> 00:53:55.100]   But another way that we end up drifting is by making small compromises.
[00:53:55.100 --> 00:53:59.100]   In this particular situation, just, "Is that really that important?
[00:53:59.100 --> 00:54:02.100]   Do we really need to do that? What about this?"
[00:54:02.100 --> 00:54:06.100]   And we have a tendency to rationalize disobedience if we're not careful.
[00:54:06.100 --> 00:54:11.100]   And so when he says, "Make sure that we are not neglecting,
[00:54:11.100 --> 00:54:15.100]   that compromising and justification isn't happening in our mind
[00:54:15.100 --> 00:54:20.100]   for the purpose of our own protection."
[00:54:20.100 --> 00:54:24.100]   Hebrews 3, 12, "Take care, brethren, that there not be in any one of you
[00:54:24.100 --> 00:54:28.100]   an evil, unbelieving heart that falls away from the living God."
[00:54:28.100 --> 00:54:31.100]   Over and over again, he says, "Do not neglect, do not neglect, do not neglect.
[00:54:31.100 --> 00:54:35.100]   Do not let yourself drift."
[00:54:35.100 --> 00:54:37.100]   So we need to be anchored in Christ.
[00:54:37.100 --> 00:54:40.100]   Being anchored in Christ doesn't mean that you have to show up at church.
[00:54:40.100 --> 00:54:41.100]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:54:41.100 --> 00:54:44.100]   I think it's a great opportunity, especially for those of you families
[00:54:44.100 --> 00:54:47.100]   who are at home with your children, to share the gospel with your kids.
[00:54:47.100 --> 00:54:50.100]   So talk about the worship. Talk about the songs.
[00:54:50.100 --> 00:54:54.100]   It's a great opportunity to establish that if that wasn't there.
[00:54:54.100 --> 00:54:56.100]   Talk about Melchizedek.
[00:54:56.100 --> 00:54:59.100]   Disciple your children. It's a great opportunity.
[00:54:59.100 --> 00:55:02.100]   But it's Christ at the center of all of this.
[00:55:02.100 --> 00:55:06.100]   When we tend to neglect our salvation and we allow ourselves to drift,
[00:55:06.100 --> 00:55:10.100]   the first place where that shows is the way that we treat our neighbors.
[00:55:10.100 --> 00:55:13.100]   And that's why he says in Hebrews 13, 2,
[00:55:13.100 --> 00:55:17.100]   "Do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers.
[00:55:17.100 --> 00:55:21.100]   For by this some have entertained angels without knowing it."
[00:55:21.100 --> 00:55:23.100]   And again, Hebrews 13, 16,
[00:55:23.100 --> 00:55:29.100]   "And do not neglect doing good and sharing, for with such sacrifices God is pleased."
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:31.100]   Remember.
[00:55:31.100 --> 00:55:34.100]   Remember what he said about this church previously.
[00:55:34.100 --> 00:55:37.100]   How they endured great conflict.
[00:55:37.100 --> 00:55:39.100]   That even made public spectacles.
[00:55:39.100 --> 00:55:41.100]   They showed sympathy, visited prisoners.
[00:55:41.100 --> 00:55:44.100]   They did all of this at one point.
[00:55:44.100 --> 00:55:48.100]   But they're telling them, "Don't neglect it now,
[00:55:48.100 --> 00:55:52.100]   while this persecution is going on.
[00:55:52.100 --> 00:55:57.100]   While our natural inclination is to be in our shell,
[00:55:57.100 --> 00:55:59.100]   me and my family only."
[00:55:59.100 --> 00:56:02.100]   And that's why he's telling them in that context,
[00:56:02.100 --> 00:56:06.100]   "Do not neglect to show hospitality towards strangers."
[00:56:06.100 --> 00:56:10.100]   The most vulnerable people in our society right now are the elderly.
[00:56:10.100 --> 00:56:13.100]   Because if you look at the chart of people who contracted
[00:56:13.100 --> 00:56:16.100]   and who are getting seriously ill and possibly even dying,
[00:56:16.100 --> 00:56:20.100]   the chart goes from almost negligible to young people
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:22.100]   to very dangerous to old people.
[00:56:22.100 --> 00:56:25.100]   People who are 70 and older in our society.
[00:56:25.100 --> 00:56:30.100]   People who are 70 and older in our society don't usually use internet.
[00:56:30.100 --> 00:56:33.100]   In fact, I know some people in their 50s that don't use it.
[00:56:33.100 --> 00:56:35.100]   But people in their 70s and 80s usually don't know.
[00:56:35.100 --> 00:56:37.100]   So they don't know what's going on.
[00:56:37.100 --> 00:56:39.100]   They're hearing it through the grapevine or through television.
[00:56:39.100 --> 00:56:42.100]   And we are hearing more and more stories of the elderly
[00:56:42.100 --> 00:56:46.100]   who are showing up to supermarkets with nothing.
[00:56:46.100 --> 00:56:48.100]   They can't find toilet paper.
[00:56:48.100 --> 00:56:52.100]   They can't find just daily necessities.
[00:56:52.100 --> 00:56:57.100]   To love our neighbors shouldn't just be to isolate ourselves.
[00:56:57.100 --> 00:56:59.100]   Obviously, we need to be wise.
[00:56:59.100 --> 00:57:01.100]   We need to do what we need to do to take care of our families,
[00:57:01.100 --> 00:57:03.100]   make sure that this doesn't spread.
[00:57:03.100 --> 00:57:06.100]   But loving our neighbors in the context of struggle
[00:57:06.100 --> 00:57:10.100]   shouldn't just be protecting our families.
[00:57:10.100 --> 00:57:14.100]   It's a great opportunity to practice this agape love.
[00:57:14.100 --> 00:57:17.100]   While everybody else is running from danger,
[00:57:17.100 --> 00:57:22.100]   God may be calling the church to run to danger in certain contexts
[00:57:22.100 --> 00:57:24.100]   to see who are in need.
[00:57:24.100 --> 00:57:27.100]   Those of you who have seven years of toilet paper,
[00:57:27.100 --> 00:57:31.100]   I encourage you to give up some.
[00:57:31.100 --> 00:57:36.100]   If these senior homes that are around us are running out,
[00:57:36.100 --> 00:57:40.100]   if you have enough Purell to last until Jesus comes,
[00:57:40.100 --> 00:57:41.100]   look around you.
[00:57:41.100 --> 00:57:45.100]   Maybe there are neighbors who don't have any.
[00:57:45.100 --> 00:57:48.100]   If you have more food than you can handle,
[00:57:48.100 --> 00:57:52.100]   that if this virus goes for another 10 years, you're safe,
[00:57:52.100 --> 00:57:54.100]   then maybe you can look around and see
[00:57:54.100 --> 00:57:57.100]   if there are some people who don't have access to this,
[00:57:57.100 --> 00:58:00.100]   that this is the perfect time to use the resources that we have
[00:58:00.100 --> 00:58:03.100]   to share the love of Christ with them.
[00:58:03.100 --> 00:58:05.100]   That's what he is saying, that in the context of all of this,
[00:58:05.100 --> 00:58:09.100]   do not neglect to show hospitality to strangers,
[00:58:09.100 --> 00:58:11.100]   do not neglect to doing good and sharing,
[00:58:11.100 --> 00:58:14.100]   do not neglect the very core of our identity,
[00:58:14.100 --> 00:58:21.100]   be put in the back burner because we are concerned about our own safety.
[00:58:21.100 --> 00:58:23.100]   This is the time to really glorify Christ.
[00:58:23.100 --> 00:58:27.100]   We're talking about the agape love, the end result of all of this.
[00:58:27.100 --> 00:58:31.100]   In fact, Chapter 13 ends with, if you believe this,
[00:58:31.100 --> 00:58:34.100]   and you practice faith, and you look upon Christ,
[00:58:34.100 --> 00:58:36.100]   who is the authentic perfecter of our faith,
[00:58:36.100 --> 00:58:40.100]   Chapter 13 ends with, therefore, practice this agape love.
[00:58:40.100 --> 00:58:44.100]   If there's any time where that needs to come to the forefront of our lives,
[00:58:44.100 --> 00:58:47.100]   it is now.
[00:58:47.100 --> 00:58:49.100]   We've been working hard.
[00:58:49.100 --> 00:58:53.100]   We have our outreach team who has been working hard to set up the gospel night,
[00:58:53.100 --> 00:58:55.100]   and I know that many are disappointed because they've been praying,
[00:58:55.100 --> 00:58:58.100]   they've been preparing, they've been going out in the streets.
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:59:01.100]   As much as we have been preparing to share the gospel,
[00:59:01.100 --> 00:59:05.100]   and Easter is coming up, and timing, humanly speaking, may be really bad
[00:59:05.100 --> 00:59:08.100]   because Easter typically is the most attended Sunday service,
[00:59:08.100 --> 00:59:10.100]   and the gospel is being preached.
[00:59:10.100 --> 00:59:13.100]   Many people come to Christ as a result of all of this.
[00:59:13.100 --> 00:59:20.100]   But know that as much as we have been preparing to bring the gospel to the world,
[00:59:20.100 --> 00:59:25.100]   God has been preparing behind the scene from the moment Adam and Eve fell.
[00:59:25.100 --> 00:59:32.100]   That even in this, God may be doing something to prepare the preaching of the gospel.
[00:59:32.100 --> 00:59:36.100]   We have a greater platform than we would have ever had
[00:59:36.100 --> 00:59:39.100]   if all we did was just gather together.
[00:59:39.100 --> 00:59:41.100]   We have a greater platform to preach the gospel.
[00:59:41.100 --> 00:59:44.100]   We have a greater platform to show the glory of God.
[00:59:44.100 --> 00:59:48.100]   We have a greater platform to demonstrate what agape love looks like
[00:59:48.100 --> 00:59:53.100]   in the context where everybody else is bunkering down in their shelters.
[00:59:53.100 --> 00:59:59.100]   Let us not neglect showing hospitality and doing good to those around us.
[00:59:59.100 --> 01:00:04.100]   The broad outline of the book of Hebrews, he begins by saying in chapter 1,
[01:00:04.100 --> 01:00:05.100]   "Jesus is better than the angels."
[01:00:05.100 --> 01:00:10.100]   And the point of that is, "Therefore pay attention to him."
[01:00:10.100 --> 01:00:13.100]   Right now we're online, and I'm online almost daily, hourly,
[01:00:13.100 --> 01:00:17.100]   looking at the news, making sure, and we're online chatting with the leaders.
[01:00:17.100 --> 01:00:20.100]   What are we practicing? What do we do? We need to communicate.
[01:00:20.100 --> 01:00:25.100]   But in the midst of all of this, the point of why it begins by saying,
[01:00:25.100 --> 01:00:32.100]   "Jesus is greater than the angels," he says, "Therefore you must pay close attention to him."
[01:00:32.100 --> 01:00:37.100]   First and foremost, that we need to be careful that in the midst of all these information
[01:00:37.100 --> 01:00:40.100]   that's being disseminated through all these social medias,
[01:00:40.100 --> 01:00:44.100]   are we founded in the word of God first?
[01:00:44.100 --> 01:00:47.100]   Is the paradigm in which we look at the world and how we make decisions,
[01:00:47.100 --> 01:00:51.100]   is that founded upon the gospel that you and I profess?
[01:00:51.100 --> 01:00:54.100]   So first and foremost, are we paying attention to Christ
[01:00:54.100 --> 01:00:58.100]   before we pay attention to the media and whatever it is that we're paying attention to?
[01:00:58.100 --> 01:01:01.100]   So that whatever we do in response to the information that we're getting,
[01:01:01.100 --> 01:01:06.100]   we're founded upon the paradigm that is created by Christ.
[01:01:06.100 --> 01:01:10.100]   Do not be conformed to this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind
[01:01:10.100 --> 01:01:15.100]   so that you may be able to test the perfect will of God.
[01:01:15.100 --> 01:01:19.100]   Is the word of God first and foremost before anything else?
[01:01:19.100 --> 01:01:23.100]   Second of all, chapter 3, Jesus is greater than Moses.
[01:01:23.100 --> 01:01:25.100]   Moses was the greatest leader.
[01:01:25.100 --> 01:01:30.100]   In times like this, our natural instinct is to look to leaders for guidance.
[01:01:30.100 --> 01:01:33.100]   What is President Trump saying? What is the governor saying?
[01:01:33.100 --> 01:01:36.100]   In fact, what is the church leader saying?
[01:01:36.100 --> 01:01:41.100]   And we have been bombarded with emails and texts and social medias.
[01:01:41.100 --> 01:01:44.100]   What are we doing? What's happening?
[01:01:44.100 --> 01:01:48.100]   And it's understandable because our natural instinct is to look to leadership.
[01:01:48.100 --> 01:01:52.100]   Moses was their greatest leader, but he reminds them,
[01:01:52.100 --> 01:01:55.100]   as great as Moses was, he was just a servant.
[01:01:55.100 --> 01:01:58.100]   Jesus was the son.
[01:01:58.100 --> 01:02:01.100]   And the point of all of this is, if you're going to look for any leader,
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:04.100]   don't look for a higher hand.
[01:02:04.100 --> 01:02:06.100]   Because higher hand, when the wolves come,
[01:02:06.100 --> 01:02:09.100]   they pack up and they leave because they have to protect themselves.
[01:02:09.100 --> 01:02:15.100]   But the good shepherd, Christ Jesus, he lays down his life for his sheep.
[01:02:15.100 --> 01:02:19.100]   So if there's anybody that we're going to look to, we're going to look to Christ first.
[01:02:19.100 --> 01:02:22.100]   That he's in our boat. He's the one who's in charge.
[01:02:22.100 --> 01:02:26.100]   And the moment that we forget that is when panic happens,
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:29.100]   when the chairs get knocked over.
[01:02:29.100 --> 01:02:33.100]   Thirdly, chapter 4, he is greater than Joshua.
[01:02:33.100 --> 01:02:39.100]   Chapter 4 leads us into Joshua because Joshua is the one who led them into rest.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:42.100]   The true rest is found in Christ.
[01:02:42.100 --> 01:02:46.100]   If Joshua was able to lead them into rest, that would have been it.
[01:02:46.100 --> 01:02:50.100]   But he says, no, all of that was pointing to the true rest that Jesus comes,
[01:02:50.100 --> 01:02:52.100]   that Jesus is going to take us into.
[01:02:52.100 --> 01:02:55.100]   And he says, so therefore, let us fear that we do not enter this,
[01:02:55.100 --> 01:02:58.100]   that we fall short of entering this rest.
[01:02:58.100 --> 01:03:01.100]   In other words, look to Christ as our rest.
[01:03:01.100 --> 01:03:06.100]   Our comfort is not found in maybe some of you guys were diligent
[01:03:06.100 --> 01:03:09.100]   and went to the market way ahead of time, and you have plenty of toilet paper,
[01:03:09.100 --> 01:03:13.100]   plenty of Purell, you got enough food if Armageddon happens.
[01:03:13.100 --> 01:03:16.100]   That is not our rest.
[01:03:16.100 --> 01:03:19.100]   We're not waiting for President Trump to say everything is good.
[01:03:19.100 --> 01:03:22.100]   If he says it's good, is it good?
[01:03:22.100 --> 01:03:25.100]   If our local leaders say, you know what, there's no danger,
[01:03:25.100 --> 01:03:28.100]   now go out and live like the way that everybody else is living.
[01:03:28.100 --> 01:03:32.100]   Is it good?
[01:03:32.100 --> 01:03:35.100]   Where do we truly find our rest?
[01:03:35.100 --> 01:03:37.100]   Christ is our rest.
[01:03:37.100 --> 01:03:40.100]   Come to me, all who are weary and heavy laden.
[01:03:40.100 --> 01:03:42.100]   Are you burdened? Are you scared?
[01:03:42.100 --> 01:03:45.100]   Are you looking for leadership? Are you looking for guidance?
[01:03:45.100 --> 01:03:49.100]   Come to me, he says.
[01:03:49.100 --> 01:03:52.100]   All you who are weary and heavy laden.
[01:03:52.100 --> 01:03:55.100]   And he says, I will give you rest.
[01:03:55.100 --> 01:03:58.100]   My peace I give unto you.
[01:03:58.100 --> 01:04:01.100]   And this is a peace that the world does not know.
[01:04:01.100 --> 01:04:05.100]   Is this the peace that we have in Christ?
[01:04:05.100 --> 01:04:08.100]   And then finally, chapter 5 through 7, the true mediator.
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:10.100]   That's where Melchizedek comes in.
[01:04:10.100 --> 01:04:13.100]   And we started in chapter 5, and then he takes a break in chapter 6,
[01:04:13.100 --> 01:04:16.100]   says he's our true mediator, but if Christ is not your mediator,
[01:04:16.100 --> 01:04:22.100]   and you begin to drift away to the world, there is no other salvation.
[01:04:22.100 --> 01:04:25.100]   And he reminds us that, how important this is,
[01:04:25.100 --> 01:04:29.100]   and then he moves on to chapter 7, which we will be jumping into at some point.
[01:04:29.100 --> 01:04:31.100]   That's a broad outline.
[01:04:31.100 --> 01:04:36.100]   And then chapter 8, 9, and 10 leads us into the covenant.
[01:04:36.100 --> 01:04:38.100]   The new covenant versus the old covenant.
[01:04:38.100 --> 01:04:42.100]   And then he leads us to chapter 11, that this is the examples of these men
[01:04:42.100 --> 01:04:45.100]   who had genuine faith in God, and this is what their life looked like,
[01:04:45.100 --> 01:04:48.100]   which leads us to chapter 12 and 13.
[01:04:48.100 --> 01:04:54.100]   "Therefore, fix your eyes upon Jesus, the author and perfecter of our faith."
[01:04:54.100 --> 01:05:00.100]   And the greatest application of that, chapter 13, is this agape love.
[01:05:00.100 --> 01:05:05.100]   But the point of all of this is not simply to get our minds to think about Jesus,
[01:05:05.100 --> 01:05:07.100]   because that's just a beginning point.
[01:05:07.100 --> 01:05:10.100]   The reason why we need to think about Jesus is so that thinking about Jesus,
[01:05:10.100 --> 01:05:14.100]   that we would apply what it means to be anchored in Christ.
[01:05:14.100 --> 01:05:17.100]   And that's exactly--there is more "let us" statements in the book of Hebrews
[01:05:17.100 --> 01:05:19.100]   than any other book.
[01:05:19.100 --> 01:05:22.100]   Because the point of this isn't simply Christology.
[01:05:22.100 --> 01:05:27.100]   That if you know who Jesus is compared to angels and Moses and the prophets
[01:05:27.100 --> 01:05:31.100]   and Melchizedek, and you got that all down, but that's where it ends,
[01:05:31.100 --> 01:05:34.100]   you missed the whole point, because the whole point of the book of Hebrews is "therefore."
[01:05:34.100 --> 01:05:38.100]   If you know who that Jesus is, our anchor, if you know that Jesus is our hope,
[01:05:38.100 --> 01:05:43.100]   He's our peace, He's our leader, He's the one that we need to pay attention to,
[01:05:43.100 --> 01:05:47.100]   then "let us therefore."
[01:05:47.100 --> 01:05:50.100]   So I want to highlight a few of these as I wrap up.
[01:05:50.100 --> 01:05:57.100]   In chapter 4, verse 1, "Therefore let us fear while promise remains of entering His rest."
[01:05:57.100 --> 01:06:00.100]   The first thing that he tells us, the beginning of wisdom.
[01:06:00.100 --> 01:06:04.100]   Right now, we are all praying for wisdom.
[01:06:04.100 --> 01:06:08.100]   The world is praying for--even non-Christians are praying and hoping for wisdom.
[01:06:08.100 --> 01:06:11.100]   What should we do? When should we shut down?
[01:06:11.100 --> 01:06:14.100]   When should we open? What is okay to do? What is not okay to do?
[01:06:14.100 --> 01:06:18.100]   Everybody is seeking wisdom. The Bible says the beginning of wisdom is what?
[01:06:18.100 --> 01:06:21.100]   Fear of the Lord.
[01:06:21.100 --> 01:06:25.100]   And so we want to be prayerful as leadership,
[01:06:25.100 --> 01:06:31.100]   that whatever decision is being made, that it is first founded upon our reverence for Him.
[01:06:31.100 --> 01:06:33.100]   That we are anchored in Christ.
[01:06:33.100 --> 01:06:35.100]   And we're asking the church to do the same.
[01:06:35.100 --> 01:06:40.100]   Whether you are having worship at home, whether you are having worship here,
[01:06:40.100 --> 01:06:45.100]   wherever you are, our first and foremost is to check our own hearts.
[01:06:45.100 --> 01:06:48.100]   Is the fear of the Lord driving us?
[01:06:48.100 --> 01:06:54.100]   In Matthew 10, 28-31, "Do not fear those who kill the body, but are unable to kill the soul.
[01:06:54.100 --> 01:06:59.100]   But rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in hell.
[01:06:59.100 --> 01:07:04.100]   Are not two sparrows sold for a cent, and yet not one of them will fall to the ground apart from your Father?
[01:07:04.100 --> 01:07:07.100]   But the very hairs of your head are all numbered."
[01:07:07.100 --> 01:07:09.100]   Let me stop right there.
[01:07:09.100 --> 01:07:12.100]   He says to fear the Lord.
[01:07:12.100 --> 01:07:16.100]   But the reason why we ought to fear the Lord is because He loves us.
[01:07:16.100 --> 01:07:20.100]   The reason why that needs to be the foundation upon which we stand
[01:07:20.100 --> 01:07:23.100]   is because all other men are fleeing for safety.
[01:07:23.100 --> 01:07:25.100]   Just like we are.
[01:07:25.100 --> 01:07:30.100]   But the only one who can actually protect us,
[01:07:30.100 --> 01:07:33.100]   the only one who knows what's coming tomorrow,
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:37.100]   the only one who knows where it's going, only God knows.
[01:07:37.100 --> 01:07:42.100]   And that sovereign God that we fear, He counts every hair on our head.
[01:07:42.100 --> 01:07:47.100]   So do not fear. You are more valuable than the sparrows.
[01:07:47.100 --> 01:07:52.100]   And that's why we need to, especially at this time, ask ourselves,
[01:07:52.100 --> 01:07:57.100]   "Is the fear of the Lord in which I stand today?
[01:07:57.100 --> 01:08:00.100]   Or is it the fear of this virus?"
[01:08:00.100 --> 01:08:04.100]   Our greatest fear should not be catching this virus.
[01:08:04.100 --> 01:08:09.100]   Our greatest fear is if we catch this virus, that am I going to die?
[01:08:09.100 --> 01:08:14.100]   That shouldn't be our greatest fear, even though it's our natural human response.
[01:08:14.100 --> 01:08:17.100]   Our greatest fear is to be separated from God.
[01:08:17.100 --> 01:08:22.100]   Our greatest fear is that our loved ones would pass without knowing Him.
[01:08:22.100 --> 01:08:26.100]   Our greatest fear is not death.
[01:08:26.100 --> 01:08:30.100]   Ultimately, death is a release from this broken body,
[01:08:30.100 --> 01:08:32.100]   that we may be with the Lord.
[01:08:32.100 --> 01:08:35.100]   To be absent in the flesh is to be with the Lord.
[01:08:35.100 --> 01:08:39.100]   Is the fear of the Lord foundation upon which we are doing and making all decisions?
[01:08:39.100 --> 01:08:42.100]   Hebrews 4.14, "Therefore, since we have a great high priest
[01:08:42.100 --> 01:08:45.100]   who has passed through the heavens, Jesus the Son of God,
[01:08:45.100 --> 01:08:48.100]   let us hold fast our confession."
[01:08:48.100 --> 01:08:52.100]   Let us not passively allow this to happen
[01:08:52.100 --> 01:08:55.100]   and just kind of hunker down until this passes over.
[01:08:55.100 --> 01:08:58.100]   Let us hold fast.
[01:08:58.100 --> 01:09:03.100]   Let us practice our faith in confidence and in courage.
[01:09:03.100 --> 01:09:07.100]   This is a great opportunity to magnify Christ.
[01:09:07.100 --> 01:09:11.100]   My prayer is that revival will break out because of this,
[01:09:11.100 --> 01:09:15.100]   because of the way the Christians are responding to this.
[01:09:15.100 --> 01:09:18.100]   Hebrews 10.24, "And let us consider how to stimulate one another
[01:09:18.100 --> 01:09:21.100]   to love and good deeds."
[01:09:21.100 --> 01:09:25.100]   To consider carefully, to think and calculate.
[01:09:25.100 --> 01:09:27.100]   A couple of weeks ago, we talked about that.
[01:09:27.100 --> 01:09:31.100]   We talked about this text, to consider how to provoke one another.
[01:09:31.100 --> 01:09:34.100]   A couple of weeks ago, this was around,
[01:09:34.100 --> 01:09:39.100]   but now I think that our emotional state is a lot more fertile to receive this word.
[01:09:39.100 --> 01:09:42.100]   It's agape love.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:47.100]   Consider carefully not just your family, not just are you safe,
[01:09:47.100 --> 01:09:51.100]   but the people around us,
[01:09:51.100 --> 01:09:54.100]   especially the elderly who are confused.
[01:09:54.100 --> 01:09:56.100]   Maybe next time you go to the supermarket,
[01:09:56.100 --> 01:10:00.100]   watch for people who couldn't get what they needed to get.
[01:10:00.100 --> 01:10:02.100]   Do you have too many?
[01:10:02.100 --> 01:10:06.100]   Maybe you have neighbors who are not connected to the Internet.
[01:10:06.100 --> 01:10:08.100]   Maybe there's an elderly person.
[01:10:08.100 --> 01:10:12.100]   Maybe there's an elderly home filled with dozens,
[01:10:12.100 --> 01:10:15.100]   maybe possibly hundreds of elderly
[01:10:15.100 --> 01:10:18.100]   who do not have the ability to run to the supermarket
[01:10:18.100 --> 01:10:21.100]   and go get food if they wanted to.
[01:10:21.100 --> 01:10:24.100]   To consider carefully how to stimulate, provoke one another
[01:10:24.100 --> 01:10:26.100]   on toward loving good deeds,
[01:10:26.100 --> 01:10:30.100]   not forsaking our own assembly together as is a habit of some.
[01:10:30.100 --> 01:10:32.100]   Remember the context.
[01:10:32.100 --> 01:10:34.100]   Again, this is not the same context
[01:10:34.100 --> 01:10:37.100]   because we're not under persecution.
[01:10:37.100 --> 01:10:39.100]   There's no sin in going online.
[01:10:39.100 --> 01:10:41.100]   We're doing everything.
[01:10:41.100 --> 01:10:45.100]   In fact, many are doing this so that it doesn't spread faster than it needs to.
[01:10:45.100 --> 01:10:48.100]   So it's not the exact same situation,
[01:10:48.100 --> 01:10:53.100]   but the principle behind it is to place a high value
[01:10:53.100 --> 01:10:55.100]   on the gathering of believers.
[01:10:55.100 --> 01:10:58.100]   When it is time, when it is the wisest thing to do,
[01:10:58.100 --> 01:11:01.100]   we will make that decision.
[01:11:01.100 --> 01:11:04.100]   But we don't want to knock over the chairs in that process.
[01:11:04.100 --> 01:11:06.100]   We don't want to panic.
[01:11:06.100 --> 01:11:08.100]   We want to respond to what's going on,
[01:11:08.100 --> 01:11:11.100]   and we want to make sure that whether we are out
[01:11:11.100 --> 01:11:15.100]   or whether we are home, we are responding and not reacting.
[01:11:15.100 --> 01:11:19.100]   But meanwhile, let's be careful.
[01:11:19.100 --> 01:11:27.100]   Let's be careful to realize what we have been given.
[01:11:27.100 --> 01:11:30.100]   We've been praying for people to come to Christ.
[01:11:30.100 --> 01:11:33.100]   The ground is more fertile now.
[01:11:33.100 --> 01:11:36.100]   We are praying for opportunities to share the gospel.
[01:11:36.100 --> 01:11:39.100]   People are more open now.
[01:11:39.100 --> 01:11:42.100]   We're praying for opportunities to show agape love.
[01:11:42.100 --> 01:11:45.100]   More opportunities have been created now.
[01:11:45.100 --> 01:11:50.100]   Let's stay sober and redeem the opportunity that God has given us
[01:11:50.100 --> 01:11:53.100]   and not react like the rest of the world.
[01:11:53.100 --> 01:11:57.100]   Hebrews 12, "Therefore, since we have so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us,
[01:11:57.100 --> 01:12:03.100]   let us also lay aside every encumbrance and sin which so easily entangles."
[01:12:03.100 --> 01:12:06.100]   There are certain things that we have to put down,
[01:12:06.100 --> 01:12:09.100]   our temporary Bible study going online, meeting together, fellowship,
[01:12:09.100 --> 01:12:14.100]   the gospel night, all of this at some point will be picked back up when this passes.
[01:12:14.100 --> 01:12:17.100]   But there are also things that we cannot do right now
[01:12:17.100 --> 01:12:21.100]   that maybe we should put down and not pick up.
[01:12:21.100 --> 01:12:23.100]   What are some of these encumbrances?
[01:12:23.100 --> 01:12:26.100]   So when these things happen, it forces us to examine what we value,
[01:12:26.100 --> 01:12:28.100]   what is important, what is not important.
[01:12:28.100 --> 01:12:33.100]   Anything that is not essential has been shut down.
[01:12:33.100 --> 01:12:36.100]   Some of these things probably should not be picked up.
[01:12:36.100 --> 01:12:41.100]   What are these things that we need to carefully consider?
[01:12:41.100 --> 01:12:48.100]   Chapter 13, verse 3, "So let us go out to him outside the camp bearing his reproach."
[01:12:48.100 --> 01:12:55.100]   Since Jesus was crucified outside the camp, meaning that's where anybody who is shunned by the society,
[01:12:55.100 --> 01:12:58.100]   that they will be taken outside the camp to be stoned.
[01:12:58.100 --> 01:13:00.100]   If you were a leper, you were sent outside the camp.
[01:13:00.100 --> 01:13:03.100]   So when he says, "Let us go outside the camp with Christ,"
[01:13:03.100 --> 01:13:07.100]   he means let's leave behind the comforts of this world.
[01:13:07.100 --> 01:13:13.100]   Let's leave behind wanting to be accepted.
[01:13:13.100 --> 01:13:16.100]   Follow Christ outside the camp.
[01:13:16.100 --> 01:13:19.100]   That we are aliens and strangers just passing through.
[01:13:19.100 --> 01:13:24.100]   That maybe this virus is a reminder to us that all who are united with Christ
[01:13:24.100 --> 01:13:28.100]   is united with Christ already outside the camp.
[01:13:28.100 --> 01:13:32.100]   So maybe this is a good opportunity for us to reflect and examine our lives
[01:13:32.100 --> 01:13:35.100]   and to join him willfully outside.
[01:13:35.100 --> 01:13:43.100]   And then finally, chapter 13, verse 15, "Through him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God."
[01:13:43.100 --> 01:13:47.100]   Remember the context that this is written.
[01:13:47.100 --> 01:13:50.100]   People are afraid of death.
[01:13:50.100 --> 01:13:54.100]   Some of them may have seen their friends crucified.
[01:13:54.100 --> 01:13:59.100]   Maybe their brother, their child, their mother, their uncle, grandparents.
[01:13:59.100 --> 01:14:04.100]   They may have already seen them in the Colosseum being torn apart by wild animals.
[01:14:04.100 --> 01:14:06.100]   He's talking to that group.
[01:14:06.100 --> 01:14:11.100]   He's talking to people who may have even smelled the flesh of their own loved ones burning
[01:14:11.100 --> 01:14:14.100]   because of the cruelty of Nero.
[01:14:14.100 --> 01:14:17.100]   That's who he's speaking to.
[01:14:17.100 --> 01:14:22.100]   "In the midst of that, through him then, let us continually offer up a sacrifice of praise to God."
[01:14:22.100 --> 01:14:29.100]   Because even in that, God is on his throne.
[01:14:29.100 --> 01:14:33.100]   There is a kind of worship that we give to God in time of peace,
[01:14:33.100 --> 01:14:39.100]   and even then it is sweet, even then it is necessary.
[01:14:39.100 --> 01:14:45.100]   But sometimes there are circumstances in our lives, whether it is private or whether it is public,
[01:14:45.100 --> 01:14:49.100]   whether it is small or whether it is large,
[01:14:49.100 --> 01:14:57.100]   there are certain periods of our life where the worship of our Savior becomes that much sweeter.
[01:14:57.100 --> 01:15:06.100]   Our greatest witness to the world is to declare the glory of God in the midst of this darkness
[01:15:06.100 --> 01:15:12.100]   because the light shines much brighter when the world does not see light.
[01:15:12.100 --> 01:15:18.100]   So let us not neglect the opportunity that God has given us and be anchored in Christ.
[01:15:18.100 --> 01:15:25.100]   So just as an--again, just we're asking you that things are rapidly changing,
[01:15:25.100 --> 01:15:32.100]   and the Orange County Health Offices are telling us that at least as of now it is still low,
[01:15:32.100 --> 01:15:36.100]   and that may change overnight, you know, with more testing that are coming.
[01:15:36.100 --> 01:15:40.100]   So we are not being naive, and we are being pressed on both sides.
[01:15:40.100 --> 01:15:45.100]   We have "Don't ever close your door," and those people are slowly dissipating,
[01:15:45.100 --> 01:15:49.100]   and then more and more of "We should have closed it three months ago," you know,
[01:15:49.100 --> 01:15:55.100]   and we are under tremendous pressure, and the easiest thing that we could do is just shut it, you know,
[01:15:55.100 --> 01:16:00.100]   and go online, which we may end up doing even as early as this week.
[01:16:00.100 --> 01:16:05.100]   But we want to make sure that whatever we do that we are not reacting,
[01:16:05.100 --> 01:16:13.100]   that we are responding, and we are responding carefully, wisely, prayerfully, firmly anchored in Christ.
[01:16:13.100 --> 01:16:16.100]   So that is our request for you to do the same.
[01:16:16.100 --> 01:16:21.100]   Watch, listen, pray, and I hope that the message this morning,
[01:16:21.100 --> 01:16:24.100]   a reminder of the overview of the book of Hebrews,
[01:16:24.100 --> 01:16:27.100]   will serve as a foundation upon everything that we do going forward.
[01:16:27.100 --> 01:16:30.100]   Let me pray for us, and then I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray.
[01:16:30.100 --> 01:16:36.100]   And as we said, we're not going to have an official offering time for the sake of sanitation.
[01:16:36.100 --> 01:16:41.100]   So when you are done, when the service is over, if you are planning to physically bring the offering,
[01:16:41.100 --> 01:16:47.100]   then it will be in those two houses, okay, that's prepared in the front.
[01:16:47.100 --> 01:16:49.100]   Okay, then please do that after the service.
[01:16:49.100 --> 01:16:55.100]   All right, let's pray.
[01:16:55.100 --> 01:16:59.100]   Gracious Father, we pray for wisdom.
[01:16:59.100 --> 01:17:03.100]   We pray for protection.
[01:17:03.100 --> 01:17:06.100]   But more than anything else, we pray for soberness.
[01:17:06.100 --> 01:17:09.100]   We pray for courage, Lord God.
[01:17:09.100 --> 01:17:16.100]   Help us, Lord, to open our eyes to see the opportunities that have been created because of this situation.
[01:17:16.100 --> 01:17:19.100]   Lord, we pray for revival.
[01:17:19.100 --> 01:17:23.100]   There are people in our lives that we've been praying for,
[01:17:23.100 --> 01:17:29.100]   that they would soften their hearts to hear you.
[01:17:29.100 --> 01:17:33.100]   And I pray, Father, that this would cause them to think of you.
[01:17:33.100 --> 01:17:37.100]   I pray that the whole world would come to the knowledge
[01:17:37.100 --> 01:17:41.100]   that we are just a mist that comes and disappears,
[01:17:41.100 --> 01:17:47.100]   that as fear of this virus and fear of death grips the world,
[01:17:47.100 --> 01:17:51.100]   I pray that you would allow Christians to rise up
[01:17:51.100 --> 01:17:56.100]   and to be able to point to you that there is hope,
[01:17:56.100 --> 01:18:01.100]   that things are not hopeless, that this is the very reason why Christ came.
[01:18:01.100 --> 01:18:05.100]   So we pray that you would give courage to the Christian leaders.
[01:18:05.100 --> 01:18:10.100]   We pray for much wisdom, Lord God, to when to do what and when not to do what.
[01:18:10.100 --> 01:18:14.100]   But above all, may Christ and what he has done
[01:18:14.100 --> 01:18:19.100]   be magnified beyond what we can possibly muster up with our own strength,
[01:18:19.100 --> 01:18:24.100]   and that what you are doing may be clearly seen, Father God, through all of this.
[01:18:24.100 --> 01:18:28.100]   We thank you. Thank you for your love.
[01:18:28.100 --> 01:18:31.100]   We thank you for your grace.
[01:18:31.100 --> 01:18:34.100]   I pray, Lord God, that the church may be strengthened through all of it.
[01:18:34.100 --> 01:18:37.100]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:18:37.100 --> 01:18:41.100]   As our worship team comes up to lead us, let's take some time to pray.
[01:18:41.100 --> 01:18:45.100]   And then afterwards we'll sing our final song.
[01:18:45.100 --> 01:18:47.100]   And I'll just give you an instruction.
[01:18:47.100 --> 01:18:52.100]   Because this is our second service, we are going to shut down the church sooner than later.
[01:18:52.100 --> 01:18:55.100]   So we're going to ask you, as soon as the service is over,
[01:18:55.100 --> 01:18:58.100]   try to--if you're going to congregate, to do it outside,
[01:18:58.100 --> 01:19:00.100]   so that the people who need to lock up, they can lock up.
[01:19:00.100 --> 01:19:02.100]   And then if you're going to visit, you can do it outside.
[01:19:02.100 --> 01:19:05.100]   So you're not going to freeze to death out there.
[01:19:05.100 --> 01:19:08.100]   So if you guys can help us to do that as soon as the service is over.

[01:25:51.760 --> 01:25:54.760]   - All right, let's pray.
[01:25:54.760 --> 01:25:56.760]   Gracious and loving Father,
[01:25:56.760 --> 01:25:59.760]   we pray that in season and out of season
[01:25:59.760 --> 01:26:02.760]   that we may be ready to share with the world
[01:26:02.760 --> 01:26:04.760]   the hope that we have in Christ.
[01:26:04.760 --> 01:26:07.340]   And I especially pray for the most vulnerable
[01:26:07.340 --> 01:26:09.340]   in our church, in our community,
[01:26:09.340 --> 01:26:12.340]   the elderly, Lord God, that you would watch over them.
[01:26:12.340 --> 01:26:15.340]   I pray, Father, that you would protect them.
[01:26:15.340 --> 01:26:18.340]   And I pray that, again, that it's a great reminder, Lord God,
[01:26:18.340 --> 01:26:21.340]   to seek you and you alone.
[01:26:21.340 --> 01:26:23.340]   We pray for our healthcare workers, Lord,
[01:26:23.340 --> 01:26:25.340]   as they are in the front line.
[01:26:25.340 --> 01:26:27.340]   I pray that you would give them courage, Lord,
[01:26:27.340 --> 01:26:29.340]   to see the opportunities, Lord God,
[01:26:29.340 --> 01:26:32.340]   that in their work that you would protect them.
[01:26:32.760 --> 01:26:34.340]   But even more importantly, Lord God,
[01:26:34.340 --> 01:26:37.340]   that the aroma of Christ may be clearly evident, Lord God,
[01:26:37.340 --> 01:26:40.340]   in your children in these vulnerable places.
[01:26:40.340 --> 01:26:44.340]   We pray that you would guide and protect our children.
[01:26:44.340 --> 01:26:46.340]   We pray for fathers, Lord God,
[01:26:46.340 --> 01:26:48.340]   that you would give them courage and wisdom
[01:26:48.340 --> 01:26:50.340]   as they leave their homes.
[01:26:50.340 --> 01:26:53.340]   Pray for mothers, Lord, who need to spend extra time
[01:26:53.340 --> 01:26:55.340]   because their children are at home.
[01:26:55.340 --> 01:26:57.340]   Give them the energy that they need, Lord God,
[01:26:57.340 --> 01:26:59.340]   that they would make the most of the opportunity.
[01:26:59.340 --> 01:27:02.340]   We pray for wisdom for our leadership, Lord God,
[01:27:02.340 --> 01:27:04.920]   that you would give us courage,
[01:27:04.920 --> 01:27:07.920]   but at the same time, sensitivity,
[01:27:07.920 --> 01:27:09.920]   and to have wisdom, Lord God,
[01:27:09.920 --> 01:27:12.920]   to make sure that all that we do,
[01:27:12.920 --> 01:27:15.920]   that we would do wisely according to your word.
[01:27:15.920 --> 01:27:18.920]   We pray for our congregation as we go our own way.
[01:27:18.920 --> 01:27:22.920]   And we don't know how long you may have ordained this,
[01:27:22.920 --> 01:27:25.920]   but may the time that you have given us
[01:27:25.920 --> 01:27:29.920]   be redeemed for the sake of your gospel and your glory.
[01:27:30.340 --> 01:27:32.920]   We pray that you would give us the strength
[01:27:32.920 --> 01:27:35.920]   to be a part of the world, Lord God,
[01:27:35.920 --> 01:27:39.920]   that is under control and influence of the God of this age.
[01:27:39.920 --> 01:27:43.920]   That it be a time for the church to open our eyes to see
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:45.920]   that if we have been drifting,
[01:27:45.920 --> 01:27:48.920]   if we haven't been anchored in Christ,
[01:27:48.920 --> 01:27:51.920]   I pray, Father, that you would first bring revival
[01:27:51.920 --> 01:27:54.920]   in our churches for the sake of your name.
[01:27:54.920 --> 01:27:57.920]   So we pray for the coming days and weeks.
[01:27:58.340 --> 01:28:00.920]   Now the grace of our Lord Jesus Christ
[01:28:00.920 --> 01:28:03.920]   and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit,
[01:28:03.920 --> 01:28:06.920]   eternal love and power of God our Father,
[01:28:06.920 --> 01:28:11.920]   consume our thoughts, our will, our emotions, and our life.
[01:28:11.920 --> 01:28:14.920]   For the sake of your glory, amen.
[01:28:14.920 --> 01:28:18.920]   God sent his son
[01:28:18.920 --> 01:28:24.920]   They called him Jesus
[01:28:25.340 --> 01:28:29.920]   He came to love
[01:28:29.920 --> 01:28:34.920]   Heal and forgive
[01:28:34.920 --> 01:28:40.920]   He lived and died
[01:28:40.920 --> 01:28:45.920]   To buy my pardon
[01:28:45.920 --> 01:28:51.920]   An empty grave is there to prove
[01:28:52.340 --> 01:28:56.920]   My Savior lives
[01:28:56.920 --> 01:29:01.920]   Because he lives
[01:29:01.920 --> 01:29:06.920]   I can face tomorrow
[01:29:06.920 --> 01:29:11.920]   Because he lives
[01:29:11.920 --> 01:29:16.920]   All fear is gone
[01:29:17.340 --> 01:29:22.920]   Because I know
[01:29:22.920 --> 01:29:26.920]   He holds the future
[01:29:26.920 --> 01:29:31.920]   And life is worth the living
[01:29:31.920 --> 01:29:38.920]   Just because he lives
[01:29:38.920 --> 01:29:40.920]   Amen
