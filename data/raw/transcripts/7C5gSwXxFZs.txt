[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.400]   We can feel trust in a God who is sovereign,
[00:00:02.400 --> 00:00:06.480]   that we can approach Him with fear and reverence,

[00:00:09.640 --> 00:00:13.200]   we can reflect on His great mercy towards us as well.

[00:03:21.760 --> 00:03:36.060]   - Good morning, everybody.
[00:03:36.060 --> 00:03:37.980]   Hope everyone had a great Christmas,
[00:03:37.980 --> 00:03:40.280]   reflecting on our Savior's birth.
[00:03:40.280 --> 00:03:42.580]   And if any of you are here for the first time,
[00:03:42.580 --> 00:03:44.580]   I wanna extend a warm welcome to you.
[00:03:44.580 --> 00:03:46.900]   Please do stop by and visit our welcome table,
[00:03:46.900 --> 00:03:49.060]   which is right at the entry of the parking lot.
[00:03:49.060 --> 00:03:50.180]   We'd love to connect with you,

[00:03:52.500 --> 00:03:54.820]   and fill out a welcome card too.
[00:03:54.820 --> 00:03:57.180]   Couple announcements for us this morning.
[00:03:57.180 --> 00:03:59.300]   This Thursday is December 31st.
[00:03:59.300 --> 00:04:03.960]   We're gonna be having our New Year service online at 11 p.m.
[00:04:03.960 --> 00:04:06.380]   We're gonna open up that Zoom room a little bit early
[00:04:06.380 --> 00:04:08.820]   so that people can jump on in, say hi,
[00:04:08.820 --> 00:04:10.400]   and then we'll promptly start our service.
[00:04:10.400 --> 00:04:12.920]   So please make sure you're there.
[00:04:12.920 --> 00:04:14.340]   For the link and the password,
[00:04:14.340 --> 00:04:16.360]   there's gonna be a password protection on that.
[00:04:16.360 --> 00:04:17.740]   Please make sure you look at the app
[00:04:17.740 --> 00:04:20.380]   and Facebook site for those links.
[00:04:20.380 --> 00:04:23.000]   The second announcement is for our Bible study.
[00:04:23.000 --> 00:04:25.160]   Please make sure to sign up for the next session,
[00:04:25.160 --> 00:04:26.280]   which is going to be covering
[00:04:26.280 --> 00:04:30.020]   the book of 2 Thessalonians, called Future Hope.
[00:04:30.020 --> 00:04:32.220]   Please do sign up by January 15th.
[00:04:32.220 --> 00:04:34.260]   We're asking just for a little bit earlier sign up
[00:04:34.260 --> 00:04:37.540]   so that we can allot people to the right groups.
[00:04:37.540 --> 00:04:39.080]   Again, also for the home groups wise,
[00:04:39.080 --> 00:04:41.220]   even for those of you who've been going to home groups
[00:04:41.220 --> 00:04:43.300]   for a long time for multiple sessions,
[00:04:43.300 --> 00:04:45.260]   we ask that you do sign up so we have a good,
[00:04:45.260 --> 00:04:47.300]   accurate picture of who's in which group.
[00:04:47.300 --> 00:04:50.780]   Lastly, I wanna highlight again that our membership class
[00:04:50.780 --> 00:04:53.180]   is gonna be starting January 17th.
[00:04:53.180 --> 00:04:54.660]   So if you have been attending
[00:04:54.660 --> 00:04:56.700]   and you're interested in becoming a member,
[00:04:56.700 --> 00:04:57.980]   please make sure to sign up for that.
[00:04:57.980 --> 00:05:01.380]   It takes place Sunday morning from 9 a.m. to 10.30.
[00:05:01.380 --> 00:05:02.860]   It's an eight week course,
[00:05:02.860 --> 00:05:05.520]   and it's gonna be starting again on January 17th.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:06.460]   If you have any question,
[00:05:06.460 --> 00:05:08.580]   you can reach out to Pastor Nate for that.
[00:05:08.580 --> 00:05:10.020]   All right, at this time,
[00:05:10.020 --> 00:05:11.580]   we're gonna be praying for our offering.
[00:05:11.580 --> 00:05:14.380]   And again, if you wanna submit a physical check,
[00:05:14.380 --> 00:05:16.300]   our offering box is there right in the back
[00:05:16.300 --> 00:05:18.380]   in front of the cry room window.
[00:05:18.380 --> 00:05:20.020]   Let's take a moment to pray together
[00:05:20.020 --> 00:05:21.920]   as we enter into our time of offering.
[00:05:21.920 --> 00:05:26.660]   Heavenly Father, we wanna say to you, God, in prayer
[00:05:26.660 --> 00:05:29.540]   that you are truly worthy of all of our worship
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.640]   and all of our adoration.
[00:05:31.640 --> 00:05:34.900]   And it is our prayer, God, that whether we are singing,
[00:05:34.900 --> 00:05:38.040]   whether we are attentively listening to your word,
[00:05:38.040 --> 00:05:40.820]   whatever we're doing, Lord, we wanna be worshiping you.
[00:05:40.820 --> 00:05:42.100]   And even in our giving, Father,
[00:05:42.100 --> 00:05:44.940]   we wanna be rendering our service to you.
[00:05:44.940 --> 00:05:47.960]   And so we pray, Father God, that you receive our gifts
[00:05:47.960 --> 00:05:49.940]   from a heart of servanthood.
[00:05:49.940 --> 00:05:51.560]   And we pray, God, that you would continue
[00:05:51.560 --> 00:05:54.060]   to use all things to your glory,
[00:05:54.060 --> 00:05:55.700]   to your spiritual work, Father,
[00:05:55.700 --> 00:05:58.020]   and that you would continue to advance your kingdom.
[00:05:58.020 --> 00:06:00.620]   We pray, Father Lord, for this morning's service,
[00:06:00.620 --> 00:06:03.800]   God, that ultimately it would be something honoring to you,
[00:06:03.800 --> 00:06:05.220]   but that, God, we would be blessed
[00:06:05.220 --> 00:06:07.580]   and convicted from hearing your truth.
[00:06:07.580 --> 00:06:10.020]   And God, that as we are here gathered to worship you, Lord,
[00:06:10.020 --> 00:06:11.860]   it would be a blessing to us as well.
[00:06:11.860 --> 00:06:14.500]   We thank you, Lord, it's in Christ and we pray, amen.
[00:06:14.500 --> 00:06:16.920]   (soft music)
[00:06:16.920 --> 00:06:19.340]   (soft music)
[00:06:19.340 --> 00:06:21.760]   (soft music)
[00:06:49.020 --> 00:06:51.260]   Church family, let's all rise together
[00:06:51.260 --> 00:06:53.860]   for those outside as well as online.
[00:06:53.860 --> 00:06:55.860]   We're gonna sing this song, it's a fast song,
[00:06:55.860 --> 00:06:58.620]   which we don't often do.
[00:06:58.620 --> 00:07:02.060]   And I want to encourage you to follow our sister, Kat, here.
[00:07:02.060 --> 00:07:04.300]   She'll be on the tambourine.
[00:07:04.300 --> 00:07:07.980]   And just a reminder that as we come before our God,
[00:07:07.980 --> 00:07:11.460]   that obviously we're singing these songs with our heads
[00:07:11.460 --> 00:07:14.500]   and our knowledge that these things are true,
[00:07:14.500 --> 00:07:16.260]   but as well, God is looking at our hearts
[00:07:16.260 --> 00:07:18.300]   and worship is an emotional time.
[00:07:18.300 --> 00:07:21.860]   It's hard for us to see your emotions through your mask,
[00:07:21.860 --> 00:07:23.440]   but we'll deal with that.
[00:07:23.440 --> 00:07:26.580]   But just as an encouragement that as we sing these songs,
[00:07:26.580 --> 00:07:29.980]   that our emotions will come through as well.
[00:07:29.980 --> 00:07:31.700]   So I encourage you as well.
[00:07:31.700 --> 00:07:36.920]   (upbeat music)

[00:21:11.320 --> 00:21:14.980]   - Amen, you may be seated.
[00:21:23.220 --> 00:21:24.940]   Okay, well good morning everyone.
[00:21:24.940 --> 00:21:27.780]   Now if you could turn with me to Matthew chapter 24.
[00:21:27.780 --> 00:21:30.140]   I will be reading verses eight through 13 here.
[00:21:30.140 --> 00:21:41.440]   Starting from verse eight.
[00:21:41.440 --> 00:21:44.140]   The foolish said to the prudent,
[00:21:44.140 --> 00:21:47.500]   "Give us some of your oil, for our lamps are going out."
[00:21:47.500 --> 00:21:48.340]   But the prudent answered,
[00:21:48.340 --> 00:21:51.340]   "No, there will not be enough for us and you too.
[00:21:51.340 --> 00:21:54.540]   "Go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves."
[00:21:54.540 --> 00:21:56.500]   And while they were going away to make the purchase,
[00:21:56.500 --> 00:21:58.180]   the bridegroom came and those who were ready
[00:21:58.180 --> 00:21:59.940]   went in with him to the wedding feast,
[00:21:59.940 --> 00:22:01.760]   and the door was shut.
[00:22:01.760 --> 00:22:04.120]   Later, the other virgins also came saying,
[00:22:04.120 --> 00:22:06.220]   "Lord, Lord, open up for us."
[00:22:06.220 --> 00:22:09.840]   But he answered, "Truly I say to you, I do not know you.
[00:22:09.840 --> 00:22:11.280]   "Be on the alert then,
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:14.180]   "for you do not know the day nor the hour."
[00:22:14.180 --> 00:22:16.300]   All right, I'll pray for us.
[00:22:16.300 --> 00:22:20.060]   Heavenly Father, after a year like 2020,
[00:22:20.060 --> 00:22:21.980]   we've arrived here at our last Sunday,
[00:22:21.980 --> 00:22:24.260]   and we thank you.
[00:22:24.260 --> 00:22:27.260]   God, we can't help but give you worship and praise.
[00:22:27.260 --> 00:22:30.420]   Thank you that we can trust in a faithful God
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.680]   who never changes.
[00:22:31.680 --> 00:22:35.260]   And Lord, I pray that as we look into your word,
[00:22:35.260 --> 00:22:37.460]   we would remember who you are,
[00:22:37.460 --> 00:22:40.520]   we would remember the power of your word,
[00:22:40.520 --> 00:22:42.160]   and Father, we would allow it,
[00:22:42.160 --> 00:22:46.540]   God, past all the rebellion and stubbornness of our hearts,
[00:22:46.540 --> 00:22:49.260]   to soak and sanctify into our hearts.
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.780]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:22:50.780 --> 00:22:57.300]   All right, well, this is the last Sunday of 2020.
[00:22:57.300 --> 00:23:00.120]   And I was curious, I couldn't remember,
[00:23:00.120 --> 00:23:02.900]   but last year, the last Sunday of 2020,
[00:23:02.900 --> 00:23:04.060]   I actually preached as well,
[00:23:04.060 --> 00:23:06.340]   and I didn't realize it until I looked back
[00:23:06.340 --> 00:23:08.860]   to see what the topic was on last year.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:10.540]   And it was pretty fascinating,
[00:23:10.540 --> 00:23:13.420]   because it's the last Sunday of 2020,
[00:23:13.420 --> 00:23:15.620]   so what you can do is look back at the year
[00:23:15.620 --> 00:23:18.260]   and think through, man, what was the year like?
[00:23:18.260 --> 00:23:20.140]   In 2019, there wasn't much,
[00:23:20.140 --> 00:23:21.800]   but you kind of had to dig to look into
[00:23:21.800 --> 00:23:24.020]   some of the world events that happened.
[00:23:24.020 --> 00:23:27.500]   This year, you know, it's pretty self-explanatory.
[00:23:27.500 --> 00:23:29.500]   There was a lot that happened.
[00:23:29.500 --> 00:23:31.660]   And I'm gonna do the obligatory thing.
[00:23:31.660 --> 00:23:33.720]   I'm gonna kind of draw our attention again
[00:23:33.720 --> 00:23:36.200]   to some of the things, I'm not gonna go very long,
[00:23:36.200 --> 00:23:39.260]   some of the things that happened this past year.
[00:23:39.260 --> 00:23:43.500]   It was a year filled with protests, political turmoil.
[00:23:43.500 --> 00:23:46.020]   We turned on the TV to see cities on fire.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:49.180]   Saw notable deaths of famous people,
[00:23:49.180 --> 00:23:52.700]   among which were a few Christian giants.
[00:23:52.700 --> 00:23:55.900]   Wildfires, many of you were displaced from your homes
[00:23:55.900 --> 00:23:58.180]   because of these wildfires.
[00:23:58.180 --> 00:24:00.820]   There's explosions and killings.
[00:24:00.820 --> 00:24:03.780]   And obviously, the thing that probably rises
[00:24:03.780 --> 00:24:06.700]   to the surface of all of this is the global pandemic,
[00:24:06.700 --> 00:24:09.900]   COVID-19, that's the craziest thing.
[00:24:09.900 --> 00:24:12.820]   2020 really, really has been a crazy year, right?
[00:24:14.220 --> 00:24:17.660]   It's been so crazy that it's become a meme.
[00:24:17.660 --> 00:24:20.420]   For those of you who don't know what a meme is,
[00:24:20.420 --> 00:24:22.420]   it's this thing where it's a picture
[00:24:22.420 --> 00:24:26.380]   and then people describe something with this picture.
[00:24:26.380 --> 00:24:29.680]   And 2020 has become a description of sorts.
[00:24:29.680 --> 00:24:32.900]   When people think about the year 2020,
[00:24:32.900 --> 00:24:35.260]   if you haven't noticed, people kind of get angry.
[00:24:35.260 --> 00:24:38.180]   Or if something bad happens, people yell out, "2020!"
[00:24:38.180 --> 00:24:40.420]   It's kind of funny, right?
[00:24:40.420 --> 00:24:41.560]   It doesn't really make sense, but people are like,
[00:24:41.560 --> 00:24:44.740]   "Oh my gosh, only in 2020 this will happen."
[00:24:44.740 --> 00:24:48.820]   It's because this year has been so wild.
[00:24:48.820 --> 00:24:51.740]   Because of this, though, I think,
[00:24:51.740 --> 00:24:55.500]   knowingly or unknowingly, we're looking forward
[00:24:55.500 --> 00:24:57.940]   to the turn of the calendar year.
[00:24:57.940 --> 00:24:58.780]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:58.780 --> 00:25:02.660]   As if 2020 coming in is going to actually change something.
[00:25:02.660 --> 00:25:04.700]   It's not, right?
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:06.300]   It's not gonna change anything.
[00:25:06.300 --> 00:25:08.060]   It's an arbitrary date in the calendar.
[00:25:08.060 --> 00:25:10.300]   It's something that's there.
[00:25:10.300 --> 00:25:11.780]   And then once 2021 comes,
[00:25:11.780 --> 00:25:13.300]   it doesn't mean that anything's going to change.
[00:25:13.300 --> 00:25:16.100]   Everything will continue to tick on.
[00:25:16.100 --> 00:25:17.620]   But I understand.
[00:25:17.620 --> 00:25:20.440]   2020 was just so difficult.
[00:25:20.440 --> 00:25:22.320]   There are so many hard things going on
[00:25:22.320 --> 00:25:24.140]   that from a worldly perspective,
[00:25:24.140 --> 00:25:27.340]   we want things to change.
[00:25:27.340 --> 00:25:31.300]   If you think back, especially at the month of March,
[00:25:31.300 --> 00:25:34.700]   when it felt like the whole world flipped upside down,
[00:25:34.700 --> 00:25:38.700]   when everything was beginning to shut down,
[00:25:38.700 --> 00:25:40.480]   we're all sheltering in place,
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:43.340]   a word that comes to mind, a favorite of Berean,
[00:25:43.340 --> 00:25:45.300]   is this word soberness.
[00:25:45.300 --> 00:25:47.340]   And what a sobering time it actually was.
[00:25:47.340 --> 00:25:48.720]   It was so sobering.
[00:25:48.720 --> 00:25:52.580]   It put life into perspective.
[00:25:52.580 --> 00:25:55.620]   Really, just one swing of things,
[00:25:55.620 --> 00:25:58.500]   and the entire world was brought to its knees.
[00:25:58.500 --> 00:26:05.340]   This virus, it's unseen by the naked eye, right?
[00:26:05.340 --> 00:26:06.740]   It's so small.
[00:26:07.680 --> 00:26:09.820]   And really, it just brought devastation.
[00:26:09.820 --> 00:26:11.980]   It flipped everything upside down.
[00:26:11.980 --> 00:26:17.020]   For many of us, as we sat in our rooms
[00:26:17.020 --> 00:26:18.300]   trying to work from home,
[00:26:18.300 --> 00:26:19.460]   we had our frontline workers,
[00:26:19.460 --> 00:26:20.900]   we had our healthcare workers,
[00:26:20.900 --> 00:26:23.420]   among whom, I mean, we need many prayers for them now,
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:25.340]   but besides them,
[00:26:25.340 --> 00:26:27.580]   many of us found ourselves working from home.
[00:26:27.580 --> 00:26:32.420]   And I remember talking to people
[00:26:33.340 --> 00:26:38.340]   and thinking, wow, people sound very sober right now.
[00:26:38.340 --> 00:26:40.720]   And people would talk about their lives
[00:26:40.720 --> 00:26:43.360]   and how everything has slowed down,
[00:26:43.360 --> 00:26:46.080]   and how everything was a little quieter,
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.080]   and the time with the Lord,
[00:26:48.080 --> 00:26:49.920]   for the first time in many, many months,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:53.460]   maybe even years, it was so sweet.
[00:26:53.460 --> 00:26:57.000]   I mean, I don't know if you kind of relate with that,
[00:26:57.000 --> 00:26:59.680]   but that time, that March, April, May,
[00:26:59.680 --> 00:27:03.500]   there were a lot of people who had just sweet times
[00:27:03.500 --> 00:27:07.780]   in the Word, in prayer, in trust, in faith.
[00:27:07.780 --> 00:27:09.860]   I mean, life is so crazy, it's so hectic,
[00:27:09.860 --> 00:27:11.060]   that finally you get to this point
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:12.420]   where everything slows down,
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:14.500]   and you can't meet with people.
[00:27:14.500 --> 00:27:17.380]   It felt kind of good.
[00:27:17.380 --> 00:27:20.740]   I had a friend, he had a phrase that he used to use a lot.
[00:27:20.740 --> 00:27:22.100]   It was like, it hurts so good.
[00:27:22.100 --> 00:27:23.780]   I think that was very good, you know?
[00:27:23.780 --> 00:27:24.940]   It hurts so good.
[00:27:24.940 --> 00:27:28.940]   It felt good to feel that sobriety
[00:27:28.940 --> 00:27:31.760]   and that awareness and that perspective change
[00:27:31.760 --> 00:27:35.240]   and that sharp kind of jab of the reality of the world.
[00:27:35.240 --> 00:27:36.080]   It felt good, right?
[00:27:36.080 --> 00:27:39.540]   And so for Christians, it was actually a great time.
[00:27:39.540 --> 00:27:41.980]   It was really good.
[00:27:41.980 --> 00:27:46.340]   To feel the brittleness and the feebleness
[00:27:46.340 --> 00:27:49.240]   of our own existence was good.
[00:27:49.240 --> 00:27:50.080]   It felt good.
[00:27:50.080 --> 00:27:57.880]   The reality of a sovereign God who reigns over the world
[00:27:57.880 --> 00:27:59.520]   was brought into spotlight.
[00:27:59.520 --> 00:28:02.880]   And so something that we can espouse so easily
[00:28:02.880 --> 00:28:05.980]   and so quickly about, oh, God is sovereign,
[00:28:05.980 --> 00:28:07.880]   God is good, God is in control,
[00:28:07.880 --> 00:28:11.760]   he is the king, he is authoritative over all things.
[00:28:11.760 --> 00:28:14.320]   Nothing comes to pass but by his Word.
[00:28:14.320 --> 00:28:20.420]   But when we stare at something so life-changing,
[00:28:20.420 --> 00:28:23.600]   and we realize how far we are from the things
[00:28:23.600 --> 00:28:26.640]   that we would espouse, and it was good.
[00:28:26.640 --> 00:28:30.000]   (pages flipping)
[00:28:30.000 --> 00:28:31.720]   Now before, we lived under the illusion
[00:28:31.720 --> 00:28:33.500]   that we are actually somewhat in control
[00:28:33.500 --> 00:28:35.140]   of our own destinies.
[00:28:35.140 --> 00:28:39.480]   And talk of a sovereign God became very lip service.
[00:28:39.480 --> 00:28:43.320]   And I think during that time, many of us began again
[00:28:43.320 --> 00:28:46.620]   to truly desire the coming kingdom.
[00:28:46.620 --> 00:28:50.100]   Wow, this world is broken.
[00:28:50.100 --> 00:28:56.300]   I think many of our prayer lives were restored
[00:28:56.300 --> 00:28:57.420]   and rejuvenated.
[00:28:57.420 --> 00:29:00.560]   We were taking time to behold the Lord.
[00:29:00.560 --> 00:29:05.640]   And it was really just a good time.
[00:29:05.640 --> 00:29:08.960]   And so as we think back at 2020,
[00:29:08.960 --> 00:29:11.640]   and as we think about everything that's been happening,
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:15.800]   my hope is that today, as we go to a couple passages,
[00:29:15.800 --> 00:29:18.760]   or I mean a couple points, we're gonna be jumping around
[00:29:18.760 --> 00:29:21.320]   in a lot of passages, but that it would be an opportunity
[00:29:21.320 --> 00:29:25.240]   for us to think again about whether the soberness
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:28.060]   that came with the pandemic is still with us,
[00:29:28.060 --> 00:29:30.820]   or now, where are our eyes?
[00:29:30.820 --> 00:29:34.580]   Or to think about now, where have our attentions again gone?
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:36.740]   Where before it brought soberness and clarity
[00:29:36.740 --> 00:29:39.560]   and a desire again for God to return,
[00:29:39.560 --> 00:29:40.700]   is that the case?
[00:29:40.700 --> 00:29:42.820]   Even just this morning, when you think about yourself
[00:29:42.820 --> 00:29:45.800]   right now, is that the case?
[00:29:45.800 --> 00:29:50.020]   So I'm gonna take us through two points.
[00:29:50.020 --> 00:29:52.280]   And these two points are gonna be pretty simple ones.
[00:29:52.280 --> 00:29:54.760]   The first point is that the Old Testament people
[00:29:54.760 --> 00:29:57.080]   were waiting for the coming King.
[00:29:57.080 --> 00:29:59.220]   The Old Testament people were waiting for the coming King.
[00:29:59.220 --> 00:30:01.180]   And then the second point is very similar to that,
[00:30:01.180 --> 00:30:04.940]   is we similarly are waiting for the coming King.
[00:30:04.940 --> 00:30:09.380]   So as this pandemic, that broke us out of the pedestrian
[00:30:09.380 --> 00:30:11.060]   type of thinking and living,
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:13.380]   now, if you think about how we're living now,
[00:30:13.380 --> 00:30:15.580]   I think we've gone back into that.
[00:30:15.580 --> 00:30:17.260]   Like normalcy kind of occurs.
[00:30:17.260 --> 00:30:20.220]   And so there was a time when these things weren't a thing.
[00:30:20.220 --> 00:30:22.360]   You go into a supermarket and see everyone wearing a mask,
[00:30:22.360 --> 00:30:23.380]   and you'd be like, what is this?
[00:30:23.380 --> 00:30:24.860]   What world have we come into?
[00:30:24.860 --> 00:30:26.300]   Now you go into a supermarket, it's just,
[00:30:26.300 --> 00:30:28.020]   oh, everyone's just doing it, right?
[00:30:28.020 --> 00:30:29.820]   And everything just kind of goes back
[00:30:29.820 --> 00:30:32.020]   to normal way of life.
[00:30:32.020 --> 00:30:34.680]   So our eyes just kind of go back to like,
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:35.900]   oh, this is life.
[00:30:35.900 --> 00:30:37.780]   And we try to make this world again,
[00:30:37.780 --> 00:30:40.760]   something palatable to us.
[00:30:40.760 --> 00:30:42.960]   And so this first point,
[00:30:42.960 --> 00:30:45.060]   the things that we think about,
[00:30:45.060 --> 00:30:46.660]   the soberness that we're called to,
[00:30:46.660 --> 00:30:49.480]   and the coming of a King, and the coming of a kingdom,
[00:30:49.480 --> 00:30:51.340]   is actually something that's been happening
[00:30:51.340 --> 00:30:52.820]   all through the Bible.
[00:30:52.820 --> 00:30:56.900]   And so if you look at Christmas, for example,
[00:30:56.900 --> 00:30:59.400]   I mean, that's the whole point of Christmas,
[00:30:59.400 --> 00:31:02.060]   is that there was a people called the Israelites
[00:31:02.060 --> 00:31:05.320]   who were waiting for the Messiah King to come,
[00:31:05.320 --> 00:31:07.060]   the promised King.
[00:31:07.060 --> 00:31:09.180]   And this Messiah King was supposed to bring in
[00:31:09.180 --> 00:31:10.160]   a coming kingdom.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:14.120]   The Israelite history is so fascinating
[00:31:14.120 --> 00:31:15.900]   because there are all these prophecies
[00:31:15.900 --> 00:31:17.380]   of this Messiah to come.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:20.380]   It's just chapter after verse after passage,
[00:31:20.380 --> 00:31:22.080]   you know, it's all over the place.
[00:31:23.080 --> 00:31:25.800]   Starting with Adam and Eve,
[00:31:25.800 --> 00:31:27.440]   God promises that a singular seed,
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:30.240]   which is the Messiah, would come from Eve.
[00:31:30.240 --> 00:31:32.440]   With Abraham, he promised that a singular seed
[00:31:32.440 --> 00:31:34.880]   would come up out of his lineage,
[00:31:34.880 --> 00:31:37.320]   which is Jesus, the Messiah.
[00:31:37.320 --> 00:31:39.180]   And God actually promised Abraham
[00:31:39.180 --> 00:31:41.360]   that there would be a great people that come out of you,
[00:31:41.360 --> 00:31:42.840]   there's gonna be a great king,
[00:31:42.840 --> 00:31:44.840]   and he's gonna usher in a great kingdom.
[00:31:44.840 --> 00:31:49.120]   So when King David comes into the picture,
[00:31:49.120 --> 00:31:52.800]   it looks like maybe this is it.
[00:31:52.800 --> 00:31:55.080]   It looks like maybe God is,
[00:31:55.080 --> 00:31:57.320]   maybe this is actually the Messiah.
[00:31:57.320 --> 00:32:00.080]   Not from the line of Judah.
[00:32:00.080 --> 00:32:03.600]   Coming in to help us conquer the promised land.
[00:32:03.600 --> 00:32:06.840]   But even during the heyday of Israel,
[00:32:06.840 --> 00:32:08.380]   the golden age of Israel,
[00:32:08.380 --> 00:32:11.080]   during the time of King David, King Solomon,
[00:32:11.080 --> 00:32:12.440]   now you know it can't be it
[00:32:12.440 --> 00:32:14.240]   because there's so much sin.
[00:32:14.240 --> 00:32:17.380]   There's so much brokenness during this time.
[00:32:17.900 --> 00:32:22.900]   And this current of constantly wanting
[00:32:22.900 --> 00:32:25.940]   to make this world it,
[00:32:25.940 --> 00:32:29.380]   wanting to look for a savior that's going to come
[00:32:29.380 --> 00:32:33.020]   and make this kingdom the one that we're living for,
[00:32:33.020 --> 00:32:34.820]   it's just been all over the place.
[00:32:34.820 --> 00:32:37.980]   But quickly we know that that can't be it
[00:32:37.980 --> 00:32:39.780]   during the time of David.
[00:32:39.780 --> 00:32:42.620]   Because Assyria comes in and conquers the northern kingdom,
[00:32:42.620 --> 00:32:45.300]   Babylon comes in, conquers the southern kingdom,
[00:32:45.300 --> 00:32:48.780]   and these kingdom after kingdom after kingdom comes in
[00:32:48.780 --> 00:32:50.940]   and takes over and we're like, oh, that wasn't it.
[00:32:50.940 --> 00:32:52.640]   King David wasn't it.
[00:32:52.640 --> 00:32:54.380]   That wasn't the Messiah.
[00:32:54.380 --> 00:32:56.780]   That wasn't the Messiah who was supposed to come in
[00:32:56.780 --> 00:32:58.260]   and usher in the kingdom.
[00:32:58.260 --> 00:33:02.740]   And so Israelites, again, are brought to that place
[00:33:02.740 --> 00:33:04.780]   where it's just, he's coming.
[00:33:04.780 --> 00:33:05.700]   The king is coming.
[00:33:05.700 --> 00:33:08.640]   He's gonna usher in the kingdom.
[00:33:08.640 --> 00:33:09.660]   Wait for him.
[00:33:09.660 --> 00:33:10.560]   Look for him.
[00:33:10.560 --> 00:33:14.240]   Don't establish yourself where you are,
[00:33:14.240 --> 00:33:16.020]   especially when they're in the exile, right?
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.820]   Don't establish yourself where you are.
[00:33:18.820 --> 00:33:21.800]   Wait and look to his coming,
[00:33:21.800 --> 00:33:24.860]   to the salvation that he'll bring to the people.
[00:33:24.860 --> 00:33:29.200]   Don't get tempted by the world.
[00:33:29.200 --> 00:33:31.060]   Turn away from sin and idolatry.
[00:33:31.060 --> 00:33:32.460]   Remain faithful to God.
[00:33:32.460 --> 00:33:33.740]   Put your trust in him.
[00:33:33.740 --> 00:33:37.420]   All of that stuff was for the Israelites.
[00:33:37.420 --> 00:33:41.100]   But this is very applicable to us
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:44.100]   because these promises of a coming king
[00:33:44.100 --> 00:33:47.620]   continued, right?
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:51.100]   I mean, these promises of a king that's supposed to come,
[00:33:51.100 --> 00:33:52.820]   we find it in multiple passages.
[00:33:52.820 --> 00:33:54.660]   If you look at Isaiah 7, 14, it says,
[00:33:54.660 --> 00:33:56.960]   "Therefore the Lord himself will give you a sign.
[00:33:56.960 --> 00:33:59.860]   "Behold, a virgin will be with child and bear a son,
[00:33:59.860 --> 00:34:01.720]   "and she will call his name Immanuel.
[00:34:01.720 --> 00:34:03.340]   "For a child will be born to us,
[00:34:03.340 --> 00:34:04.480]   "a son will be given,
[00:34:04.480 --> 00:34:06.460]   "and the government will rest on his shoulders,
[00:34:06.460 --> 00:34:08.880]   "and his name will be called Wonderful Counselor,
[00:34:08.880 --> 00:34:12.940]   "Mighty God, Eternal Father, Prince of Peace."
[00:34:13.780 --> 00:34:17.280]   Micah 5, 2, "But as for you, Bethlehem Epiphthah,
[00:34:17.280 --> 00:34:19.940]   "too little to be among the clans of Judah.
[00:34:19.940 --> 00:34:23.060]   "From you one will go forth from you to be ruler in Israel.
[00:34:23.060 --> 00:34:24.860]   "His goings forth are from long ago,
[00:34:24.860 --> 00:34:26.580]   "from the days of eternity."
[00:34:26.580 --> 00:34:27.940]   And so it's promise after promise.
[00:34:27.940 --> 00:34:30.300]   These are just three prophecies, three passages,
[00:34:30.300 --> 00:34:32.980]   but it's given to Israel saying he's coming.
[00:34:32.980 --> 00:34:33.820]   The Messiah's coming.
[00:34:33.820 --> 00:34:34.660]   The king is going to come,
[00:34:34.660 --> 00:34:36.300]   and he's gonna bring in a kingdom.
[00:34:36.300 --> 00:34:39.380]   See, these Israelites are waiting,
[00:34:39.380 --> 00:34:41.420]   and they're waiting, and they're waiting.
[00:34:42.420 --> 00:34:44.620]   And so during this time of Christmas,
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:46.940]   it's really awesome, it's a beautiful time
[00:34:46.940 --> 00:34:49.420]   to remember that he actually came,
[00:34:49.420 --> 00:34:52.180]   that the prophecies were actually fulfilled,
[00:34:52.180 --> 00:34:54.180]   that the Messiah actually came
[00:34:54.180 --> 00:34:57.340]   to do what he was purposed to do.
[00:34:57.340 --> 00:35:01.820]   See, these Israelites weren't too different from us.
[00:35:01.820 --> 00:35:03.740]   They too were waiting for a king,
[00:35:03.740 --> 00:35:06.740]   a promised Messiah who would bring the salvation,
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:08.500]   who was supposed to take them home.
[00:35:10.540 --> 00:35:13.020]   I mean, when we see how the Israelites were living,
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:15.300]   it's very, very applicable to us.
[00:35:15.300 --> 00:35:19.820]   But I think that's what's terrifying.
[00:35:19.820 --> 00:35:23.060]   This is what's really scary about that,
[00:35:23.060 --> 00:35:25.900]   is that the Israelites were waiting for the king.
[00:35:25.900 --> 00:35:32.780]   Are you catching where we're going with this?
[00:35:32.780 --> 00:35:33.700]   They were waiting.
[00:35:33.700 --> 00:35:39.740]   Their entire culture was about waiting
[00:35:39.740 --> 00:35:42.100]   for the Messiah to bring in the coming kingdom.
[00:35:42.100 --> 00:35:48.000]   I mean, they were serving, they were sacrificing,
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:51.720]   they were worshipers, they were the chosen people of God.
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:52.900]   They knew that.
[00:35:52.900 --> 00:35:58.040]   These Israelites, many of them are crying out to God
[00:35:58.040 --> 00:35:59.060]   for him to come.
[00:35:59.060 --> 00:36:03.360]   This is scary, because why?
[00:36:03.360 --> 00:36:07.820]   When Jesus comes, they kill him.
[00:36:08.500 --> 00:36:12.140]   How does that happen?
[00:36:12.140 --> 00:36:13.820]   Like, how do you make that jump?
[00:36:13.820 --> 00:36:16.180]   An entire civilization of people
[00:36:16.180 --> 00:36:17.820]   waiting for the coming Messiah,
[00:36:17.820 --> 00:36:21.580]   waiting for the kingdom of God to come, Yahweh worshipers,
[00:36:21.580 --> 00:36:24.900]   that when the Messiah that they're waiting for,
[00:36:24.900 --> 00:36:26.780]   prophecy after prophecy after prophecy,
[00:36:26.780 --> 00:36:28.220]   text after text after text,
[00:36:28.220 --> 00:36:31.020]   waiting, waiting, waiting, that when he comes,
[00:36:31.020 --> 00:36:32.940]   they kill him.
[00:36:32.940 --> 00:36:35.740]   That jump is just astronomical, right?
[00:36:36.640 --> 00:36:37.920]   How does that happen?
[00:36:37.920 --> 00:36:41.540]   In John chapter five, verse 39, it says,
[00:36:41.540 --> 00:36:42.880]   Jesus says, "You search the Scriptures,
[00:36:42.880 --> 00:36:44.660]   "because you think that in them you have eternal life.
[00:36:44.660 --> 00:36:47.460]   "It is these that testify about me,
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:49.860]   "and you are unwilling to come to me,
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:51.840]   "so that you may have life."
[00:36:51.840 --> 00:36:53.640]   Like, how is it that they can't recognize
[00:36:53.640 --> 00:36:54.860]   the one they're living for?
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:58.060]   Their entire lifestyle, everything about their life
[00:36:58.060 --> 00:37:00.560]   was supposed to be waiting for this king to come.
[00:37:00.560 --> 00:37:03.260]   What happened?
[00:37:03.260 --> 00:37:06.920]   (audience laughing)
[00:37:06.920 --> 00:37:09.580]   Furthermore, when Jesus comes,
[00:37:09.580 --> 00:37:13.180]   after years and years and years of anticipation
[00:37:13.180 --> 00:37:17.220]   and expectation and suspense and a hope,
[00:37:17.220 --> 00:37:18.820]   when he finally comes,
[00:37:18.820 --> 00:37:26.340]   yeah, it's murder, crucifixion.
[00:37:26.340 --> 00:37:32.340]   This happens because it reveals something
[00:37:32.340 --> 00:37:33.540]   about the human heart.
[00:37:33.540 --> 00:37:35.300]   This isn't just the Israelites.
[00:37:35.300 --> 00:37:37.620]   This reveals something about the human heart.
[00:37:37.620 --> 00:37:40.220]   See, these Israelites are waiting
[00:37:40.220 --> 00:37:43.200]   and looking for a Messiah king of their own making.
[00:37:43.200 --> 00:37:47.940]   These Israelites, they were looking for a Messiah king
[00:37:47.940 --> 00:37:51.380]   who would deliver them to everything their hearts desired,
[00:37:51.380 --> 00:37:53.700]   and when the Messiah king did not look
[00:37:53.700 --> 00:37:57.020]   like the king they wanted or the king they expected,
[00:37:57.020 --> 00:37:59.820]   they didn't just grumble and complain
[00:37:59.820 --> 00:38:04.500]   and unwillingly, grumblingly follow God or follow Jesus.
[00:38:04.500 --> 00:38:07.460]   They didn't just say, "Oh, man, this wasn't what I expected."
[00:38:07.460 --> 00:38:10.200]   They didn't just push Jesus aside and ignore him.
[00:38:10.200 --> 00:38:11.740]   What was the response?
[00:38:11.740 --> 00:38:14.540]   It was murder.
[00:38:14.540 --> 00:38:19.420]   Because that's what the human heart does.
[00:38:19.420 --> 00:38:21.540]   That's what the sinful person does.
[00:38:21.540 --> 00:38:26.620]   When the promised Messiah king finally arrived
[00:38:26.620 --> 00:38:29.260]   into the world, their reaction completely exposed
[00:38:29.260 --> 00:38:32.620]   the desires of their hearts and how far they were from God.
[00:38:32.620 --> 00:38:37.020]   A simple definition of sin means to miss the mark.
[00:38:37.020 --> 00:38:39.680]   Now, the Israelites missed the mark.
[00:38:39.680 --> 00:38:43.700]   I mean, what they did to Jesus was this tangible,
[00:38:43.700 --> 00:38:48.700]   a concrete example of what sin is and what sin does
[00:38:48.700 --> 00:38:50.860]   and what sin accomplishes.
[00:38:50.860 --> 00:38:53.860]   Oh, you missed the mark.
[00:38:58.940 --> 00:39:01.820]   Look at this prophecy of Jesus in Isaiah 53.2.
[00:39:01.820 --> 00:39:04.380]   It says, "For he grew up before him like a tender shoot
[00:39:04.380 --> 00:39:06.260]   "and like a root out of parched ground.
[00:39:06.260 --> 00:39:08.640]   "He had no stately form or majesty
[00:39:08.640 --> 00:39:09.920]   "that we should look upon him,
[00:39:09.920 --> 00:39:12.540]   "nor appearance that we should be attracted to him.
[00:39:12.540 --> 00:39:14.800]   "He was despised and forsaken of men,
[00:39:14.800 --> 00:39:17.140]   "a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief,
[00:39:17.140 --> 00:39:20.060]   "and like one from whom men hide their face,
[00:39:20.060 --> 00:39:23.020]   "he was despised and we did not esteem him."
[00:39:23.020 --> 00:39:28.300]   I mean, this picture of Jesus being unattractive
[00:39:29.220 --> 00:39:31.440]   is not just like being like, oh.
[00:39:31.440 --> 00:39:33.860]   First of all, it's not just talking about
[00:39:33.860 --> 00:39:34.680]   his physical appearance.
[00:39:34.680 --> 00:39:35.860]   That's not what this is talking about.
[00:39:35.860 --> 00:39:39.040]   It's that people are just unattracted to the man.
[00:39:39.040 --> 00:39:41.300]   But when you think about that, you're like, okay.
[00:39:41.300 --> 00:39:42.440]   But when you think about that,
[00:39:42.440 --> 00:39:45.760]   what about Jesus was particularly unattractive?
[00:39:45.760 --> 00:39:51.700]   He isn't unattractive, right?
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:54.940]   He healed people.
[00:39:56.620 --> 00:39:58.420]   He miraculously fed people.
[00:39:58.420 --> 00:39:59.620]   He loved people so much,
[00:39:59.620 --> 00:40:01.860]   and he preached others to love people.
[00:40:01.860 --> 00:40:04.060]   He was gentle and kind to the poor.
[00:40:04.060 --> 00:40:05.700]   He helped the disenfranchised.
[00:40:05.700 --> 00:40:06.900]   He was a great teacher.
[00:40:06.900 --> 00:40:08.660]   He taught to love.
[00:40:08.660 --> 00:40:10.300]   Like when people think of Gandhi,
[00:40:10.300 --> 00:40:12.420]   I don't think of anyone hating the guy.
[00:40:12.420 --> 00:40:13.580]   I don't think of anyone saying like,
[00:40:13.580 --> 00:40:15.360]   what an unattractive dude.
[00:40:15.360 --> 00:40:17.600]   I don't like his message.
[00:40:17.600 --> 00:40:19.540]   No, actually, you know, when we go evangelizing
[00:40:19.540 --> 00:40:21.740]   around the campus at UCI and different places,
[00:40:21.740 --> 00:40:23.100]   you talk to people, and people say,
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:24.700]   oh, who's Jesus?
[00:40:24.700 --> 00:40:26.540]   He's a good teacher.
[00:40:26.540 --> 00:40:28.660]   He's a pretty like, I mean, I know he's a loving guy,
[00:40:28.660 --> 00:40:29.600]   good morals.
[00:40:29.600 --> 00:40:34.660]   But this passage in Isaiah 53 is talking about like,
[00:40:34.660 --> 00:40:36.500]   man, he's unattractive.
[00:40:36.500 --> 00:40:39.000]   There's actually something repelling about the man.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:41.640]   So what is it?
[00:40:41.640 --> 00:40:45.660]   Like what causes a person to look upon Jesus
[00:40:45.660 --> 00:40:47.060]   and be repelled?
[00:40:47.060 --> 00:40:53.380]   Well, if it's a Jesus of your own making,
[00:40:53.380 --> 00:40:54.340]   it's not repelling.
[00:40:56.460 --> 00:40:59.900]   But if it's Jesus as who he is,
[00:40:59.900 --> 00:41:02.300]   it's incredibly threatening to the sinful heart.
[00:41:02.300 --> 00:41:06.420]   There is something inherent about Jesus
[00:41:06.420 --> 00:41:10.260]   that sinful man hates through and through.
[00:41:10.260 --> 00:41:14.380]   You know why?
[00:41:14.380 --> 00:41:17.220]   When Jesus comes, he's the king.
[00:41:17.220 --> 00:41:19.700]   You know how threatening that is?
[00:41:19.700 --> 00:41:23.700]   He's the Lord.
[00:41:23.700 --> 00:41:25.780]   He's God.
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.980]   Everything centers around him.
[00:41:28.980 --> 00:41:31.340]   You know how threatening that is to the sinner?
[00:41:31.340 --> 00:41:34.940]   When he stepped into the world,
[00:41:34.940 --> 00:41:37.620]   it demanded recognition that everything is about God,
[00:41:37.620 --> 00:41:39.900]   and life can only be found in God,
[00:41:39.900 --> 00:41:41.980]   that everything is about God's glory.
[00:41:41.980 --> 00:41:44.780]   You see, sinners cannot accept Jesus Christ,
[00:41:44.780 --> 00:41:47.980]   who is here to make our lives better, right?
[00:41:47.980 --> 00:41:49.940]   Sinners cannot accept the Jesus Christ,
[00:41:49.940 --> 00:41:53.460]   who says that life is not about me, but that it's about him.
[00:41:53.460 --> 00:41:56.060]   Sinners can't accept someone who says
[00:41:56.060 --> 00:41:58.660]   that life is about his glory and not my glory.
[00:41:58.660 --> 00:42:00.940]   That's, I mean, we can sit here
[00:42:00.940 --> 00:42:02.940]   and use Christian terms all we want.
[00:42:02.940 --> 00:42:08.420]   But man, the glory that we desire in sinfulness.
[00:42:08.420 --> 00:42:15.060]   Sinners will murder the one that threatens that,
[00:42:15.060 --> 00:42:19.140]   even ultimately God himself.
[00:42:19.140 --> 00:42:22.740]   Sinful man will be repelled by Jesus.
[00:42:22.740 --> 00:42:25.540]   Sinful man will hate him, see him as an enemy,
[00:42:25.540 --> 00:42:29.220]   a threat, and a danger to the very way they want to live.
[00:42:29.220 --> 00:42:30.540]   And we all have definite shapes
[00:42:30.540 --> 00:42:32.460]   of what we want our life to look like.
[00:42:32.460 --> 00:42:35.140]   We all have ambitions, we all have goals.
[00:42:35.140 --> 00:42:37.380]   When we come in here and we say,
[00:42:37.380 --> 00:42:38.780]   "Man, where are my eyes fixed?
[00:42:38.780 --> 00:42:42.060]   "I want them to be fixed up in heaven where Jesus is,
[00:42:42.060 --> 00:42:43.300]   "and not on the things of this world.
[00:42:43.300 --> 00:42:44.660]   "I wanna seek the things above
[00:42:44.660 --> 00:42:45.900]   "and not the things of this world.
[00:42:45.900 --> 00:42:48.020]   "I wanna seek the heavenly things and the kingdom things,
[00:42:48.020 --> 00:42:49.340]   "and not the things of this kingdom
[00:42:49.340 --> 00:42:50.180]   "and the things of this world
[00:42:50.180 --> 00:42:51.780]   "because we know they're passing away."
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.900]   Nice.
[00:42:52.900 --> 00:43:00.500]   But when we really look at where our eyes are,
[00:43:00.500 --> 00:43:04.380]   when we really look at where our ambitions are,
[00:43:04.380 --> 00:43:06.100]   and our desires, where they lay,
[00:43:06.100 --> 00:43:10.780]   I mean, it doesn't have to be,
[00:43:10.780 --> 00:43:12.820]   I want a mansion and a Lamborghini.
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.300]   It looks probably more like
[00:43:15.300 --> 00:43:17.860]   I want my student loans paid off and a girlfriend.
[00:43:20.220 --> 00:43:22.900]   But it's still just everything revolving around me.
[00:43:22.900 --> 00:43:29.900]   And while desires themselves are not always wrong,
[00:43:29.900 --> 00:43:31.620]   while they are not always the culprit,
[00:43:31.620 --> 00:43:34.820]   many times if you take a good stare at your desires,
[00:43:34.820 --> 00:43:37.460]   if you evaluate what's going on in your heart,
[00:43:37.460 --> 00:43:41.020]   you can see how quick we are to ascend to that throne
[00:43:41.020 --> 00:43:43.260]   and to kick God off that throne.
[00:43:43.260 --> 00:43:47.140]   See, that kind of sinful living is not me
[00:43:47.140 --> 00:43:48.500]   just grumbling and complaining
[00:43:48.500 --> 00:43:50.100]   and just going along with God.
[00:43:50.860 --> 00:43:54.700]   That's not just pushing him aside or ignoring him.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:58.660]   That kind of sinful heart is closer and more representative
[00:43:58.660 --> 00:44:01.420]   of what sinners were doing to Jesus on the cross.
[00:44:01.420 --> 00:44:08.460]   We don't like to think that pushing God
[00:44:08.460 --> 00:44:12.700]   off the throne of my little heart is that bad.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:19.420]   I'm here to humbly say that what humanity does in sin
[00:44:19.420 --> 00:44:21.780]   is more than pushing God off the throne.
[00:44:21.780 --> 00:44:26.060]   The desire is actually for murder.
[00:44:26.060 --> 00:44:30.020]   It's for God's nonexistence.
[00:44:30.020 --> 00:44:34.980]   I call attention back to Isaiah 53.
[00:44:34.980 --> 00:44:38.860]   I mean, just one simple thing of hermeneutics,
[00:44:38.860 --> 00:44:40.900]   just look at the pronouns.
[00:44:40.900 --> 00:44:43.620]   And that word we is actually very heavy.
[00:44:43.620 --> 00:44:48.300]   It says in Isaiah 53, we did not esteem him.
[00:44:49.140 --> 00:44:50.580]   Not they, but we.
[00:44:50.580 --> 00:44:52.180]   This is Isaiah talking here.
[00:44:52.180 --> 00:44:54.620]   It's we did not esteem him.
[00:44:54.620 --> 00:45:00.500]   When we read this, understanding that this is talking
[00:45:00.500 --> 00:45:02.420]   about the cross, and that's what happens
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:04.460]   right after this passage, right?
[00:45:04.460 --> 00:45:06.860]   The Messiah on the cross.
[00:45:06.860 --> 00:45:09.780]   This is talking about the crucifixion
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:14.100]   through which Jesus would go on our behalf.
[00:45:14.100 --> 00:45:16.820]   And so when we read this passage, rightfully,
[00:45:16.820 --> 00:45:19.940]   we look at it and it's very intimate to us.
[00:45:19.940 --> 00:45:21.820]   Yes, it's for the Israelite first,
[00:45:21.820 --> 00:45:24.380]   but then it is also for us.
[00:45:24.380 --> 00:45:26.060]   We did not esteem him.
[00:45:26.060 --> 00:45:31.820]   We sing about it, we sing about it this morning.
[00:45:31.820 --> 00:45:33.660]   Behold the man upon the cross,
[00:45:33.660 --> 00:45:35.580]   my sin upon his shoulders,
[00:45:35.580 --> 00:45:37.420]   ashamed I heard my mocking voice
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:38.660]   call out among the scoffers.
[00:45:38.660 --> 00:45:40.940]   It was my sin that held him there
[00:45:40.940 --> 00:45:43.100]   until it was accomplished.
[00:45:43.100 --> 00:45:45.340]   See, this is the desire of every sinful heart,
[00:45:45.340 --> 00:45:49.500]   not just to turn and to grumble and push God aside,
[00:45:49.500 --> 00:45:53.340]   but it's to nail him to a cross.
[00:45:53.340 --> 00:45:55.940]   Every sinful heart, that's what that is.
[00:45:55.940 --> 00:46:00.980]   That's why the Israelites, they were living for the Messiah.
[00:46:00.980 --> 00:46:02.540]   They were waiting for the Messiah,
[00:46:02.540 --> 00:46:05.300]   crying out for the Messiah, and when he came,
[00:46:05.300 --> 00:46:07.900]   he did not look like what they wanted.
[00:46:07.900 --> 00:46:10.580]   He came in declaring, I am God.
[00:46:10.580 --> 00:46:13.820]   That was incredibly threatening to them.
[00:46:14.820 --> 00:46:17.220]   The Messiah did not fulfill their deepest desire
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:18.580]   to make life better for them,
[00:46:18.580 --> 00:46:21.620]   for them to ascend to the supremacy of the throne.
[00:46:21.620 --> 00:46:25.540]   And so they killed him.
[00:46:25.540 --> 00:46:28.420]   And so this brings us into the pivot of our second point.
[00:46:28.420 --> 00:46:30.700]   Similarly, we are waiting for the coming king.
[00:46:30.700 --> 00:46:31.900]   Now, we've been talking about Israel,
[00:46:31.900 --> 00:46:34.300]   but obviously, this is so close to us.
[00:46:34.300 --> 00:46:35.820]   Just like the Israelites were waiting
[00:46:35.820 --> 00:46:36.980]   for the Messiah to come,
[00:46:36.980 --> 00:46:39.180]   we're similarly doing the same thing.
[00:46:39.180 --> 00:46:41.380]   And this is where our passage today comes in.
[00:46:41.380 --> 00:46:43.780]   We're gonna start from verse one here, Matthew 25.
[00:46:43.780 --> 00:46:46.340]   So if you could turn there, Matthew 25, verse one.
[00:46:46.340 --> 00:46:48.300]   It says there, "The kingdom of heaven
[00:46:48.300 --> 00:46:49.780]   "will be comparable to 10 virgins
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.980]   "who took their lamps and went out to meet the bridegroom.
[00:46:51.980 --> 00:46:54.580]   "Five of them were foolish, and five were prudent.
[00:46:54.580 --> 00:46:55.980]   "For when the foolish took their lamps,
[00:46:55.980 --> 00:46:57.820]   "they took no oil with them,
[00:46:57.820 --> 00:47:02.380]   "but the prudent took oil and flasks along with their lamps."
[00:47:02.380 --> 00:47:04.180]   So in this story, there are 10 virgins,
[00:47:04.180 --> 00:47:06.300]   and you could think about them as bridesmaids.
[00:47:06.300 --> 00:47:09.460]   That's probably the best way to describe them.
[00:47:09.460 --> 00:47:12.740]   Bridesmaids, that's probably the best parallel
[00:47:12.740 --> 00:47:13.580]   we have with that.
[00:47:13.580 --> 00:47:15.980]   It was customary to have a pretty extended
[00:47:15.980 --> 00:47:19.180]   like patrol the period before the actual wedding
[00:47:19.180 --> 00:47:20.460]   was supposed to happen.
[00:47:20.460 --> 00:47:23.180]   And so later on, the groom would come,
[00:47:23.180 --> 00:47:24.800]   and people would be waiting for the groom to come
[00:47:24.800 --> 00:47:27.380]   to receive him so that the groom could go to the bride
[00:47:27.380 --> 00:47:28.220]   and take her.
[00:47:28.220 --> 00:47:30.980]   That was the custom of the day.
[00:47:30.980 --> 00:47:32.460]   These bridesmaids would line up
[00:47:32.460 --> 00:47:34.620]   in anticipation of this groom to come,
[00:47:34.620 --> 00:47:37.600]   but they would not know when he was supposed to come.
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:40.660]   They just knew he was supposed to come soon, and that's it.
[00:47:40.660 --> 00:47:42.920]   It could take a long time.
[00:47:42.920 --> 00:47:45.700]   The road could be pretty perilous.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:48.460]   There could be natural disasters that occurred
[00:47:48.460 --> 00:47:51.380]   or storms that happened so that it would impede
[00:47:51.380 --> 00:47:55.720]   their path and things like that, and so they didn't know.
[00:47:55.720 --> 00:47:59.500]   So this is the setting in verse five.
[00:47:59.500 --> 00:48:01.620]   It says, "Now while the bridegroom was delaying,
[00:48:01.620 --> 00:48:04.120]   "they all got drowsy and began to sleep.
[00:48:04.120 --> 00:48:05.880]   "But at midnight there was a shout.
[00:48:05.880 --> 00:48:08.840]   "Behold, the bridegroom, come out to meet him.
[00:48:08.840 --> 00:48:12.220]   "Then all those virgins rose and trimmed their lamps."
[00:48:12.220 --> 00:48:14.740]   So what happens here is all 10 fall asleep.
[00:48:14.740 --> 00:48:18.560]   And there's no judgment pronounced on the women
[00:48:18.560 --> 00:48:19.400]   for falling asleep.
[00:48:19.400 --> 00:48:20.220]   That's important.
[00:48:20.220 --> 00:48:22.060]   We're in First Thessalonians as a church right now, right?
[00:48:22.060 --> 00:48:23.740]   The falling, we're not supposed to fall asleep.
[00:48:23.740 --> 00:48:25.000]   That's not the point of this passage.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:26.120]   They all fell asleep.
[00:48:26.120 --> 00:48:29.760]   They don't harp on the 10 saying they should have been
[00:48:29.760 --> 00:48:31.020]   awake the entire time.
[00:48:31.020 --> 00:48:35.420]   The reality is, even though we know Jesus
[00:48:35.420 --> 00:48:37.180]   is supposed to come soon, it doesn't mean
[00:48:37.180 --> 00:48:38.940]   that we're supposed to sell everything
[00:48:38.940 --> 00:48:41.740]   and then quit our jobs and then we all sit out there
[00:48:41.740 --> 00:48:43.460]   in the courtyard and wait for Jesus to come.
[00:48:43.460 --> 00:48:44.700]   We're not gonna do that, right?
[00:48:44.700 --> 00:48:46.780]   Because we don't know when he's going to come.
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.540]   We're called to continue to live our lives.
[00:48:48.540 --> 00:48:50.500]   And so it was similar to them.
[00:48:50.500 --> 00:48:56.180]   The point was that they were supposed to be prepared
[00:48:56.180 --> 00:48:57.020]   for the coming.
[00:48:57.020 --> 00:49:00.700]   And so when the bridegroom comes in the middle of the night,
[00:49:00.700 --> 00:49:03.260]   all of them wake up, all 10 of them.
[00:49:03.260 --> 00:49:04.860]   And they all go out to meet him.
[00:49:05.620 --> 00:49:08.620]   And then as they're going, they're all trimming their lamps.
[00:49:08.620 --> 00:49:13.740]   But we know from verse two, even though it's all, all, all.
[00:49:13.740 --> 00:49:15.380]   These words, if you look at the text,
[00:49:15.380 --> 00:49:16.780]   it's all, all of them are doing this,
[00:49:16.780 --> 00:49:18.220]   all of them are doing that.
[00:49:18.220 --> 00:49:20.180]   But verse two, it showed us that there are two groups
[00:49:20.180 --> 00:49:21.020]   of people, right?
[00:49:21.020 --> 00:49:22.620]   Five were foolish, five were prudent.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:30.160]   When I would think of this parable, I would think,
[00:49:30.160 --> 00:49:32.420]   like my mind would try to fill in the blank.
[00:49:32.420 --> 00:49:34.020]   Because we try to identify.
[00:49:34.020 --> 00:49:35.540]   That's what it automatically does.
[00:49:35.540 --> 00:49:38.700]   We try to identify what made the prudent the prudent,
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:41.020]   what made the foolish the foolish.
[00:49:41.020 --> 00:49:42.580]   And there were a couple ways I went.
[00:49:42.580 --> 00:49:45.820]   First, I thought maybe it's because they all fell asleep.
[00:49:45.820 --> 00:49:47.780]   Well, but that can't be it, because they all fell asleep.
[00:49:47.780 --> 00:49:49.700]   And even the five wise fell asleep.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.540]   And so it can't be them, it can't be that.
[00:49:52.540 --> 00:49:53.940]   And secondly, I thought maybe it's because
[00:49:53.940 --> 00:49:56.500]   they let the lamp go out, or close to going out.
[00:49:56.500 --> 00:49:58.300]   But it can't be that either, because they all got up
[00:49:58.300 --> 00:50:00.060]   and they all realized their lamps were running low,
[00:50:00.060 --> 00:50:01.900]   and they all trimmed their lamps.
[00:50:01.900 --> 00:50:06.900]   In verse three, is where it helps us to identify
[00:50:06.900 --> 00:50:13.020]   why five were wise, and why five were foolish.
[00:50:13.020 --> 00:50:14.900]   And the conjunction four is very helpful there,
[00:50:14.900 --> 00:50:15.900]   if you look at verse three.
[00:50:15.900 --> 00:50:19.700]   It says, four, when the foolish took their lamps,
[00:50:19.700 --> 00:50:21.700]   they took no oil with them, but the prudent took oil
[00:50:21.700 --> 00:50:23.500]   and flasks along with their lamps.
[00:50:23.500 --> 00:50:26.940]   That four gives us the evidence judging
[00:50:26.940 --> 00:50:30.100]   why some were called foolish, and why some were called wise.
[00:50:31.100 --> 00:50:34.100]   They weren't foolish because they fell asleep.
[00:50:34.100 --> 00:50:36.180]   They weren't foolish because they let the lamp go out.
[00:50:36.180 --> 00:50:38.860]   They were called foolish because they did not
[00:50:38.860 --> 00:50:42.020]   prepare extra oil, that's why.
[00:50:42.020 --> 00:50:46.280]   The wise ones had prepared extra oil,
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:49.140]   the foolish ones did not prepare extra oil, that's it.
[00:50:49.140 --> 00:50:51.440]   It was preparation.
[00:50:51.440 --> 00:50:57.660]   That's what differentiates the wise and the foolish,
[00:50:57.660 --> 00:50:58.740]   preparation.
[00:50:58.740 --> 00:51:01.380]   And what is the significance of this?
[00:51:01.380 --> 00:51:02.900]   Well, it's that the prudent were prepared
[00:51:02.900 --> 00:51:04.060]   to meet the bridegroom.
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:09.300]   The foolish were not prepared to meet the bridegroom.
[00:51:09.300 --> 00:51:14.300]   And what this does is it brings exposure to the heart.
[00:51:14.300 --> 00:51:16.140]   That's what this does.
[00:51:16.140 --> 00:51:19.020]   Preparation brings exposure to the heart.
[00:51:19.020 --> 00:51:22.540]   Remember, they look exactly the same.
[00:51:22.540 --> 00:51:27.260]   They dressed in proper clothing,
[00:51:27.260 --> 00:51:29.140]   they're anticipating the same bridegroom,
[00:51:29.140 --> 00:51:30.420]   they're holding their lamps,
[00:51:30.420 --> 00:51:32.660]   they're ready to receive him and light the way.
[00:51:32.660 --> 00:51:34.540]   They all fall asleep because it takes a while,
[00:51:34.540 --> 00:51:36.580]   and when he comes, they all get up,
[00:51:36.580 --> 00:51:38.940]   trim their lamps, and rush over.
[00:51:38.940 --> 00:51:42.260]   But it says that five were not ready.
[00:51:42.260 --> 00:51:46.860]   What does that say about their heart?
[00:51:46.860 --> 00:51:48.620]   I think this is the point right here, okay?
[00:51:48.620 --> 00:51:50.460]   What does this say about their heart?
[00:51:50.460 --> 00:51:53.220]   They didn't care.
[00:51:53.220 --> 00:51:57.160]   I think that's the whole point.
[00:51:57.680 --> 00:52:02.680]   They're not being prepared showed that they did not care
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:05.880]   about the coming of the bridegroom.
[00:52:05.880 --> 00:52:10.040]   The problem wasn't their action at his arrival,
[00:52:10.040 --> 00:52:11.680]   or rather their inaction.
[00:52:11.680 --> 00:52:18.360]   It was that long before his arrival,
[00:52:18.360 --> 00:52:21.440]   he didn't prepare.
[00:52:21.440 --> 00:52:25.880]   See, unpreparedness is the mark of a person
[00:52:25.880 --> 00:52:27.160]   who doesn't care.
[00:52:27.160 --> 00:52:31.200]   They had no desire for the bridegroom's arrival.
[00:52:31.200 --> 00:52:33.840]   You know how you know?
[00:52:33.840 --> 00:52:35.000]   Just look at your life.
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:38.920]   When you care about something,
[00:52:38.920 --> 00:52:41.120]   think about how much you prepare.
[00:52:41.120 --> 00:52:42.400]   And when you don't care about something,
[00:52:42.400 --> 00:52:43.800]   think about how you prepare.
[00:52:43.800 --> 00:52:49.240]   I took out most of my examples for today
[00:52:49.240 --> 00:52:50.640]   because the sermon was gonna go too long.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:51.840]   I'm gonna keep this one.
[00:52:53.680 --> 00:52:56.000]   I still play fantasy basketball with my old students
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:56.900]   from my old church.
[00:52:56.900 --> 00:52:58.000]   (laughs)
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:52:59.700]   And they prepare.
[00:52:59.700 --> 00:53:01.600]   Man, they have draft boards.
[00:53:01.600 --> 00:53:05.680]   One of my old students had six different boards.
[00:53:05.680 --> 00:53:08.720]   I'm sorry if you don't know basketball,
[00:53:08.720 --> 00:53:11.920]   but if one person gets taken at the top of the draft board,
[00:53:11.920 --> 00:53:14.920]   then what happens is they move on to their next draft board.
[00:53:14.920 --> 00:53:16.900]   It changes their entire plan.
[00:53:16.900 --> 00:53:18.160]   And if another guy gets taken,
[00:53:18.160 --> 00:53:19.680]   then they'll move to the next draft board.
[00:53:19.680 --> 00:53:20.960]   And their minds are thinking,
[00:53:20.960 --> 00:53:21.920]   if this person gets taken,
[00:53:21.920 --> 00:53:23.840]   I'm gonna choose this person and things like that.
[00:53:23.840 --> 00:53:25.880]   And I love it because I don't prepare at all
[00:53:25.880 --> 00:53:27.520]   and I still beat them every year.
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:31.080]   But it shows how much they care.
[00:53:31.080 --> 00:53:37.200]   If you don't care, you just kinda stroll in
[00:53:37.200 --> 00:53:38.760]   and you just do your thing, right?
[00:53:38.760 --> 00:53:39.700]   But some of you guys,
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:42.000]   I heard that fantasy basketball became an idol
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.500]   to some people at our church.
[00:53:44.500 --> 00:53:47.900]   Joking, kinda not joking, right?
[00:53:47.900 --> 00:53:48.740]   But when you look at it, you're like,
[00:53:48.740 --> 00:53:51.360]   man, that preparation you put into that.
[00:53:51.360 --> 00:53:53.760]   Why? Because you care.
[00:53:53.760 --> 00:53:54.600]   If you didn't care,
[00:53:54.600 --> 00:53:56.560]   then there's no preparation that happened.
[00:53:56.560 --> 00:54:02.200]   Have you ever seen someone get ready
[00:54:02.200 --> 00:54:06.600]   when they're gonna be in contact with somebody they like?
[00:54:06.600 --> 00:54:11.240]   Sometimes I think about,
[00:54:11.240 --> 00:54:12.440]   oh, maybe this isn't good to say.
[00:54:12.440 --> 00:54:14.480]   Well, it's okay, bam for six.
[00:54:14.480 --> 00:54:15.320]   There's bam for six.
[00:54:15.320 --> 00:54:16.560]   And I just think, it'd be funny, right?
[00:54:16.560 --> 00:54:17.920]   Like your roommate,
[00:54:17.920 --> 00:54:20.600]   you know your roommate is going out to a bam for six
[00:54:20.600 --> 00:54:23.200]   and this roommate of yours likes this one other person.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:24.160]   (laughs)
[00:54:24.160 --> 00:54:25.800]   Oh, maybe this is not good to do.
[00:54:25.800 --> 00:54:29.920]   Anyway, but when you see this person
[00:54:29.920 --> 00:54:32.400]   like taking care of themselves
[00:54:32.400 --> 00:54:33.720]   and putting every hair in place,
[00:54:33.720 --> 00:54:34.560]   you're like, what's the matter with you?
[00:54:34.560 --> 00:54:35.400]   What are you doing?
[00:54:35.400 --> 00:54:36.240]   You never do that.
[00:54:36.240 --> 00:54:37.120]   It's because they're preparing.
[00:54:37.120 --> 00:54:39.360]   Why? Because they care.
[00:54:39.360 --> 00:54:46.360]   You seen someone like really desire a job
[00:54:46.360 --> 00:54:47.480]   and get ready for a job interview?
[00:54:47.480 --> 00:54:48.840]   Have you ever seen someone?
[00:54:49.840 --> 00:54:51.520]   Man, they're like in front of the mirror
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:55.240]   and they're like getting themselves all ready.
[00:54:55.240 --> 00:54:58.680]   They have like paper after paper after paper
[00:54:58.680 --> 00:55:02.400]   all written down in these like collated notes.
[00:55:02.400 --> 00:55:04.600]   It's like, if they say this, I'm gonna do this.
[00:55:04.600 --> 00:55:06.600]   Oh, I know they're gonna come up with this question.
[00:55:06.600 --> 00:55:08.360]   And then here's 10 possible questions
[00:55:08.360 --> 00:55:09.320]   they might come up with,
[00:55:09.320 --> 00:55:11.200]   even though none of them might come out in the interview.
[00:55:11.200 --> 00:55:12.920]   They're so prepared.
[00:55:12.920 --> 00:55:14.640]   Versus the person who just kind of saunters
[00:55:14.640 --> 00:55:16.320]   into the job interview.
[00:55:16.320 --> 00:55:17.440]   And you know, they just sit down
[00:55:17.440 --> 00:55:18.280]   and you know they're not prepared.
[00:55:18.280 --> 00:55:19.200]   Why?
[00:55:19.200 --> 00:55:21.040]   Hey, do you even care about this job?
[00:55:21.040 --> 00:55:26.760]   I mean, that correlation between preparedness
[00:55:26.760 --> 00:55:29.600]   and caring is very intimate, it's very close.
[00:55:29.600 --> 00:55:34.440]   When you care about something, you always prepare.
[00:55:34.440 --> 00:55:35.920]   And when someone doesn't prepare,
[00:55:35.920 --> 00:55:37.920]   it brings exposure to their heart.
[00:55:37.920 --> 00:55:42.600]   That they don't care.
[00:55:42.600 --> 00:55:47.760]   So these five foolish women, they're exposed.
[00:55:48.880 --> 00:55:51.920]   When Jesus arrives, they're exposed.
[00:55:51.920 --> 00:55:58.400]   They weren't prepared.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:56:00.880]   Would it have been that difficult
[00:56:00.880 --> 00:56:03.000]   to procure the oil earlier on in the day?
[00:56:03.000 --> 00:56:04.880]   Would it have been that difficult for them
[00:56:04.880 --> 00:56:08.480]   to go into town and like purchase it and have it ready?
[00:56:08.480 --> 00:56:11.440]   The answer's no.
[00:56:11.440 --> 00:56:16.200]   And so these five foolish ones, exposed at the moment
[00:56:16.200 --> 00:56:18.600]   when it says, the bridegroom has arrived.
[00:56:19.160 --> 00:56:21.800]   They turn quickly to the five wise.
[00:56:21.800 --> 00:56:22.640]   Look at verse eight.
[00:56:22.640 --> 00:56:23.760]   The foolish said to the prudent,
[00:56:23.760 --> 00:56:27.200]   give us some of your oil for our lamps are going out.
[00:56:27.200 --> 00:56:28.040]   But the prudent answered,
[00:56:28.040 --> 00:56:30.400]   no, there will not be enough for us and you too.
[00:56:30.400 --> 00:56:33.160]   Go instead to the dealers and buy some for yourselves.
[00:56:33.160 --> 00:56:35.000]   And while they were going away to make the purchase,
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:37.080]   the bridegroom came and those who were ready
[00:56:37.080 --> 00:56:41.680]   went in with him to the wedding feast and the door was shut.
[00:56:41.680 --> 00:56:45.520]   Later, the other virgins also came saying,
[00:56:45.520 --> 00:56:47.160]   Lord, Lord, open up for us.
[00:56:47.160 --> 00:56:50.080]   But he answered, truly I say to you, I do not know you.
[00:56:50.080 --> 00:56:54.960]   And here's the exhortation, be on the alert then.
[00:56:54.960 --> 00:56:57.420]   For you do not know the day nor the hour.
[00:56:57.420 --> 00:57:03.080]   See, the five foolish can't take the oil from the five wise.
[00:57:03.080 --> 00:57:05.960]   The five wise are like, hey, you gotta get your own.
[00:57:05.960 --> 00:57:07.520]   And rightfully so, right?
[00:57:07.520 --> 00:57:11.680]   They need enough to receive the groom.
[00:57:11.680 --> 00:57:13.320]   They need all of it.
[00:57:13.320 --> 00:57:14.160]   It's for him.
[00:57:17.040 --> 00:57:20.360]   And so we understand it is on each individual's plate.
[00:57:20.360 --> 00:57:23.960]   It is each personal person's responsibility
[00:57:23.960 --> 00:57:28.240]   to account for their own hearts.
[00:57:28.240 --> 00:57:32.080]   And these five, the moment they realized they needed oil,
[00:57:32.080 --> 00:57:33.680]   it was already too late for them.
[00:57:33.680 --> 00:57:35.640]   It was done.
[00:57:35.640 --> 00:57:39.760]   It already exposed something of the past
[00:57:39.760 --> 00:57:41.620]   and the door closed.
[00:57:41.620 --> 00:57:46.480]   If you're familiar with the book of Matthew,
[00:57:46.480 --> 00:57:48.120]   it's all about the kingdom.
[00:57:48.120 --> 00:57:49.560]   It's all about the coming king.
[00:57:49.560 --> 00:57:51.880]   Talks about this is what the kingdom looks like
[00:57:51.880 --> 00:57:54.920]   and so everything else is not that.
[00:57:54.920 --> 00:57:57.060]   And so this is what kingdom people look like.
[00:57:57.060 --> 00:57:58.760]   Matthew five, the sermon on the mount,
[00:57:58.760 --> 00:57:59.680]   when it starts with beatitudes,
[00:57:59.680 --> 00:58:02.080]   is telling you what the kingdom people look like.
[00:58:02.080 --> 00:58:07.000]   This is what the kingdom of God looks like.
[00:58:07.000 --> 00:58:11.660]   You will be either prepared or you will be unprepared.
[00:58:11.660 --> 00:58:12.500]   That's it.
[00:58:14.880 --> 00:58:16.960]   That's how you can identify.
[00:58:16.960 --> 00:58:20.400]   That's how you can see where you are.
[00:58:20.400 --> 00:58:24.960]   And I'll show your heart.
[00:58:24.960 --> 00:58:27.160]   So when we look back at the OT Israelites
[00:58:27.160 --> 00:58:29.680]   and we think, man, they completely missed it.
[00:58:29.680 --> 00:58:33.860]   When he came, they killed him.
[00:58:33.860 --> 00:58:38.840]   There is a danger of us being in a similar place
[00:58:38.840 --> 00:58:40.240]   where we look like the wise
[00:58:40.240 --> 00:58:42.560]   but we ourselves are actually foolish.
[00:58:43.520 --> 00:58:44.920]   As you might say that you're waiting
[00:58:44.920 --> 00:58:46.760]   for the coming Messiah king.
[00:58:46.760 --> 00:58:49.800]   You might say that you're prepared to go,
[00:58:49.800 --> 00:58:51.600]   that this world is passing away.
[00:58:51.600 --> 00:58:55.280]   You can say so many things that look so similar
[00:58:55.280 --> 00:58:57.800]   to what Christians ought to say.
[00:58:57.800 --> 00:59:00.480]   All of us would say we're waiting for the coming king
[00:59:00.480 --> 00:59:05.160]   but when he comes, we will be exposed.
[00:59:05.160 --> 00:59:09.520]   There will be no hiding on that day.
[00:59:10.600 --> 00:59:14.840]   And those who aren't ready will be exposed.
[00:59:14.840 --> 00:59:19.640]   That they actually have no desire for the king
[00:59:19.640 --> 00:59:21.800]   and they never had any desire for the king.
[00:59:21.800 --> 00:59:24.240]   They're unprepared.
[00:59:24.240 --> 00:59:28.420]   So when Jesus comes again, many will be in panic mode.
[00:59:28.420 --> 00:59:32.920]   Many will try to do the action
[00:59:32.920 --> 00:59:36.200]   of what they were supposed to do but it will be too late.
[00:59:38.800 --> 00:59:41.400]   Because it's not that moment that matters.
[00:59:41.400 --> 00:59:45.680]   It's the heart that's presented in that moment.
[00:59:45.680 --> 00:59:51.640]   If there's an uncaring heart that has no love
[00:59:51.640 --> 00:59:54.280]   for the coming king way prior to his arrival,
[00:59:54.280 --> 00:59:56.360]   it was just a matter of time.
[00:59:56.360 --> 00:59:58.000]   Jesus could have come a month earlier,
[00:59:58.000 --> 00:59:58.820]   it would have been the same.
[00:59:58.820 --> 01:00:00.160]   Jesus could have come a month later,
[01:00:00.160 --> 01:00:01.040]   it would have been the same.
[01:00:01.040 --> 01:00:04.440]   It's not for if I had just a little bit more time.
[01:00:04.440 --> 01:00:07.700]   We see that with the story of this Lazarus, right?
[01:00:07.700 --> 01:00:10.000]   This guy, if I just had more time,
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.600]   man, maybe I would have but it's too late.
[01:00:11.600 --> 01:00:14.360]   He finds himself in a place where it's too late.
[01:00:14.360 --> 01:00:18.540]   The time when he comes will only be an exposure
[01:00:18.540 --> 01:00:20.360]   to what already exists in our hearts.
[01:00:20.360 --> 01:00:23.520]   Unprepared people have no love for God.
[01:00:23.520 --> 01:00:27.360]   And so when he comes, they will panic,
[01:00:27.360 --> 01:00:30.040]   they will run around, they'll look for excuses.
[01:00:34.560 --> 01:00:37.700]   In actuality, he is unattractive to them.
[01:00:37.700 --> 01:00:41.600]   They want him off the throne.
[01:00:41.600 --> 01:00:44.780]   They want to be on that throne and judgment awaits.
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:49.120]   We're gonna take a look at 2 Peter 3 here, verse eight.
[01:00:49.120 --> 01:00:51.320]   It says, "But do not let this one fact
[01:00:51.320 --> 01:00:52.400]   "escape your notice, beloved,
[01:00:52.400 --> 01:00:54.820]   "that with the Lord one day is like a thousand years
[01:00:54.820 --> 01:00:56.620]   "and a thousand years like one day.
[01:00:56.620 --> 01:00:58.520]   "The Lord is not slow about his promises.
[01:00:58.520 --> 01:01:00.580]   "Some count slowness, but is patient toward you,
[01:01:00.580 --> 01:01:01.660]   "not wishing for any to perish,
[01:01:01.660 --> 01:01:04.080]   "but for all to come to repentance."
[01:01:05.080 --> 01:01:07.960]   See, this time period that we're living in right now
[01:01:07.960 --> 01:01:09.220]   is a time of grace.
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:13.840]   But it was never meant to be eternal.
[01:01:13.840 --> 01:01:17.920]   And we sing these songs like, man,
[01:01:17.920 --> 01:01:20.040]   God's loving kindness and never fails,
[01:01:20.040 --> 01:01:22.660]   his enduring love, all this kind of stuff.
[01:01:22.660 --> 01:01:25.000]   And for the believer, it's true.
[01:01:25.000 --> 01:01:26.900]   But for this world, it is not true.
[01:01:26.900 --> 01:01:31.760]   This world, we're existing in a ticking time bomb.
[01:01:31.760 --> 01:01:34.440]   If you've ever seen an hourglass with sand,
[01:01:34.440 --> 01:01:37.040]   it's already numbered how many, it's going.
[01:01:37.040 --> 01:01:40.400]   And when that thing is done, it's up.
[01:01:40.400 --> 01:01:42.180]   That's it.
[01:01:42.180 --> 01:01:46.880]   And so it says here that this time is actually meant
[01:01:46.880 --> 01:01:48.820]   to bring people to repentance.
[01:01:48.820 --> 01:01:54.400]   I mean, it has a sense of this urgency
[01:01:54.400 --> 01:01:56.000]   that when we're talking to people about this,
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:58.000]   it's not like, wow, God is good and gracious
[01:01:58.000 --> 01:02:00.240]   and loving and merciful and that's it.
[01:02:00.240 --> 01:02:04.400]   It's like, all this stuff, yes, but hurry.
[01:02:04.400 --> 01:02:13.480]   That's why in the verse right after this in verse 10,
[01:02:13.480 --> 01:02:17.240]   it says, "But the day of the Lord will come like a thief."
[01:02:17.240 --> 01:02:19.200]   Yeah, it's slow right now.
[01:02:19.200 --> 01:02:21.320]   God's patience is long-lasting right now,
[01:02:21.320 --> 01:02:24.440]   but then when he comes, thief.
[01:02:24.440 --> 01:02:26.280]   It'll be right away, it'll be sudden.
[01:02:26.280 --> 01:02:29.560]   In which the heavens will pass away like a roar
[01:02:29.560 --> 01:02:31.600]   and the elements will be destroyed with intense heat
[01:02:31.600 --> 01:02:33.640]   and the earth and its work will be burned up.
[01:02:33.640 --> 01:02:36.080]   That means everything that we see, gone.
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:41.400]   Everything that we're working for, just gone.
[01:02:41.400 --> 01:02:44.080]   And it'll be sudden.
[01:02:44.080 --> 01:02:48.560]   I mean, this is what God has always,
[01:02:48.560 --> 01:02:51.280]   you know, when we say God or Christ,
[01:02:51.280 --> 01:02:52.720]   he's the same yesterday, today, and forever.
[01:02:52.720 --> 01:02:54.640]   He never changes, he is an unchanging God.
[01:02:54.640 --> 01:02:56.920]   And we say, how could God's kindness and grace
[01:02:56.920 --> 01:02:59.920]   and mercy upon this humanity ever change?
[01:02:59.920 --> 01:03:02.040]   It's not that it ever changed, he never changed.
[01:03:02.040 --> 01:03:05.040]   He's always said, I am going to return.
[01:03:05.040 --> 01:03:07.120]   He's always said, judgment will come.
[01:03:07.120 --> 01:03:09.160]   Judgment was always the end.
[01:03:09.160 --> 01:03:20.680]   Today, we can be so certain that tomorrow will come,
[01:03:20.680 --> 01:03:21.960]   but we can't be mistaken.
[01:03:21.960 --> 01:03:24.440]   No one knows the time or the hour.
[01:03:24.440 --> 01:03:26.600]   2 Peter chapter three continues in verse 11.
[01:03:26.600 --> 01:03:29.280]   Since all these things are to be destroyed in this way,
[01:03:29.280 --> 01:03:31.120]   what sort of people ought you to be
[01:03:31.120 --> 01:03:32.960]   in holy conduct and godliness,
[01:03:32.960 --> 01:03:35.320]   looking for and hastening the coming of the day of God,
[01:03:35.320 --> 01:03:37.640]   because of which the heavens will be destroyed by burning
[01:03:37.640 --> 01:03:39.840]   and the elements will melt with intense heat,
[01:03:39.840 --> 01:03:41.000]   but according to his promise,
[01:03:41.000 --> 01:03:44.360]   we are looking for new heavens and a new earth
[01:03:44.360 --> 01:03:46.000]   in which righteousness dwells.
[01:03:46.000 --> 01:03:50.080]   I love this.
[01:03:50.080 --> 01:03:52.320]   You know what word I love a lot in this passage,
[01:03:52.320 --> 01:03:54.480]   in verse 12, looking for and hastening.
[01:03:54.480 --> 01:03:55.600]   I love the word hastening
[01:03:55.600 --> 01:03:58.080]   because I feel like it has more oomph
[01:03:58.080 --> 01:03:59.680]   than just looking for something.
[01:03:59.680 --> 01:04:02.160]   It's kind of the way my kids,
[01:04:02.160 --> 01:04:04.960]   my five-year-old and my three-year-old
[01:04:04.960 --> 01:04:07.640]   are more aware of Christmas and all that kind of stuff.
[01:04:07.640 --> 01:04:12.640]   So for the first time, my firstborn was trying to hype up
[01:04:12.640 --> 01:04:16.280]   and get my secondborn all excited about Christmas.
[01:04:16.280 --> 01:04:17.120]   And she would do that.
[01:04:17.120 --> 01:04:19.840]   She'd be like, four more days, three more days.
[01:04:19.840 --> 01:04:21.440]   We went to Home Depot a long time ago,
[01:04:21.440 --> 01:04:23.320]   and then we made that thing where those blocks,
[01:04:23.320 --> 01:04:25.480]   they change and count down the days till Christmas.
[01:04:25.480 --> 01:04:27.200]   And they were doing that every single day,
[01:04:27.200 --> 01:04:28.280]   like three more days.
[01:04:28.280 --> 01:04:30.280]   And then two days before Christmas,
[01:04:30.280 --> 01:04:31.400]   she got up and she's like, "Daddy,"
[01:04:31.400 --> 01:04:32.520]   and she was laughing by herself.
[01:04:32.520 --> 01:04:33.840]   I'm like, "What's the matter with you?"
[01:04:33.840 --> 01:04:36.040]   And then she'll say, "I'm so excited
[01:04:36.040 --> 01:04:37.600]   "because tomorrow I'm gonna wake up
[01:04:37.600 --> 01:04:39.240]   "and say tomorrow is Christmas."
[01:04:39.240 --> 01:04:40.240]   I'm like, what?
[01:04:40.240 --> 01:04:42.120]   That's so weird.
[01:04:42.120 --> 01:04:44.960]   I'm like, wow, that anticipation though.
[01:04:44.960 --> 01:04:47.600]   I mean, that's like hastening.
[01:04:47.600 --> 01:04:48.880]   I can't wait.
[01:04:48.880 --> 01:04:51.080]   It's like someone that's like, dude, chill out.
[01:04:51.080 --> 01:04:53.680]   Yeah, I wanted to say that so many times.
[01:04:53.680 --> 01:04:54.800]   Like, calm down.
[01:04:54.800 --> 01:04:56.680]   Those of you guys who have young children
[01:04:56.680 --> 01:04:58.640]   or have had young children, you remember,
[01:04:58.640 --> 01:05:01.400]   like, dude, calm down, you know?
[01:05:01.400 --> 01:05:03.000]   For no reason, they're so excited,
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.040]   they just start running around the house.
[01:05:05.040 --> 01:05:06.680]   Like, man, why do kids run?
[01:05:06.680 --> 01:05:07.520]   It's so weird.
[01:05:07.520 --> 01:05:08.360]   You don't see adults doing that.
[01:05:08.360 --> 01:05:10.200]   They're just running around the house.
[01:05:10.200 --> 01:05:13.200]   I just can't wait.
[01:05:13.200 --> 01:05:14.200]   I can't wait.
[01:05:14.200 --> 01:05:17.960]   And this passage is talking about this desire.
[01:05:17.960 --> 01:05:21.040]   It's not just like, oh my gosh, the end is gonna come.
[01:05:21.040 --> 01:05:22.600]   I'm scared, you know?
[01:05:22.600 --> 01:05:24.760]   It's like, I can't wait for it to come.
[01:05:24.760 --> 01:05:31.040]   And there's this note of finality in this.
[01:05:31.040 --> 01:05:32.440]   When it comes, it's done.
[01:05:32.440 --> 01:05:35.040]   Pastor Peter, as he's been preaching through Hebrews 9,
[01:05:35.040 --> 01:05:36.720]   in verse 27, he read this.
[01:05:36.720 --> 01:05:38.880]   "Inasmuch as it's appointed for men to die once,
[01:05:38.880 --> 01:05:40.040]   "and after this comes judgment,
[01:05:40.040 --> 01:05:41.700]   "so Christ also, having been offered once
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:42.840]   "to bear the sins of many,
[01:05:42.840 --> 01:05:45.220]   "will appear a second time for salvation
[01:05:45.220 --> 01:05:46.720]   "without reference to sin,
[01:05:46.720 --> 01:05:48.400]   "to those who eagerly await them."
[01:05:48.400 --> 01:05:50.360]   Again, there's a lot to unpack there,
[01:05:50.360 --> 01:05:53.600]   but just to highlight, those who eagerly await them.
[01:05:53.600 --> 01:05:54.800]   I love the word eagerly.
[01:05:54.800 --> 01:05:58.200]   You're eager.
[01:05:58.200 --> 01:06:03.200]   But the point is here, it's just once.
[01:06:03.200 --> 01:06:05.200]   And once you're there, there is no second chance.
[01:06:05.200 --> 01:06:06.200]   That's it.
[01:06:06.200 --> 01:06:07.040]   It's like the parable.
[01:06:07.040 --> 01:06:09.120]   You go to buy the oil and it's too late.
[01:06:09.120 --> 01:06:10.360]   You miss his coming.
[01:06:10.360 --> 01:06:12.720]   J.C. Ryle says this.
[01:06:12.720 --> 01:06:15.680]   "Tomorrow is the devil's day, but today is God's.
[01:06:15.680 --> 01:06:18.400]   "Satan does not care how spiritual your intentions are
[01:06:18.400 --> 01:06:20.460]   "or how holy your resolutions,
[01:06:20.460 --> 01:06:22.480]   "if only they are determined to be done tomorrow,
[01:06:22.480 --> 01:06:24.080]   "because tomorrow may not come.
[01:06:24.080 --> 01:06:27.960]   "And it's exposing something about your heart today anyway."
[01:06:27.960 --> 01:06:30.200]   And that day is final.
[01:06:30.200 --> 01:06:32.080]   In Ecclesiastes chapter nine, verse 12,
[01:06:32.080 --> 01:06:33.440]   I thought this was a good picture.
[01:06:33.440 --> 01:06:35.500]   "Moreover, man does not know his time.
[01:06:35.500 --> 01:06:37.180]   "Like fish caught in a treacherous net
[01:06:37.180 --> 01:06:38.520]   "and birds trapped in a snare,
[01:06:38.520 --> 01:06:41.720]   "so the sons of men are ensnared in an evil time
[01:06:41.720 --> 01:06:43.000]   "when it suddenly falls on them."
[01:06:43.000 --> 01:06:44.120]   That word suddenly.
[01:06:44.120 --> 01:06:46.720]   It's this fish that's swimming around, eating
[01:06:46.720 --> 01:06:48.800]   whatever food it could find floating around in the ocean,
[01:06:48.800 --> 01:06:51.920]   but one day it eats the wrong one and then it's caught
[01:06:51.920 --> 01:06:53.920]   and then his life is over.
[01:06:53.920 --> 01:06:55.240]   There is no second chance.
[01:06:55.240 --> 01:06:57.400]   There's a finality to it, and the fish knows
[01:06:57.400 --> 01:06:59.800]   when he's sitting there on the fisherman's boat.
[01:06:59.800 --> 01:07:03.600]   That's it.
[01:07:03.600 --> 01:07:04.480]   The word suddenly.
[01:07:04.480 --> 01:07:05.840]   It means unexpected.
[01:07:05.840 --> 01:07:10.440]   Back to 2 Peter three.
[01:07:10.440 --> 01:07:12.000]   Look at verse one.
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.380]   "This is now, beloved, the second letter I'm writing to you
[01:07:14.380 --> 01:07:16.340]   "in which I'm stirring up your sincere mind
[01:07:16.340 --> 01:07:19.600]   "by way of reminder that you should remember the words,"
[01:07:19.600 --> 01:07:21.480]   listen to that, "you should remember the words
[01:07:21.480 --> 01:07:23.280]   "spoken beforehand by the holy prophets
[01:07:23.280 --> 01:07:25.440]   "and the commandment of the Lord and Savior
[01:07:25.440 --> 01:07:27.620]   "spoken by your apostles.
[01:07:27.620 --> 01:07:29.480]   "Know this, first of all, that in the last days
[01:07:29.480 --> 01:07:31.060]   "mockers will come with their mocking,
[01:07:31.060 --> 01:07:33.100]   "following after their own lusts, and saying,
[01:07:33.100 --> 01:07:35.560]   "'Where is the promise of his coming?
[01:07:35.560 --> 01:07:37.120]   "'For ever since the fathers fell asleep
[01:07:37.120 --> 01:07:38.540]   "'and all continues just as it was
[01:07:38.540 --> 01:07:39.560]   "'from the beginning of creation.'"
[01:07:39.560 --> 01:07:41.640]   It kind of like, it's not the same,
[01:07:41.640 --> 01:07:44.600]   but I kind of get the feel of when the people
[01:07:44.600 --> 01:07:47.280]   are killing Jesus on Calvary,
[01:07:47.280 --> 01:07:50.440]   and they're saying like, "Who's going to save you?
[01:07:50.440 --> 01:07:52.980]   "Save yourself," like challenging him.
[01:07:52.980 --> 01:07:56.360]   I mean, it says, "In the last days, they're gonna,"
[01:07:56.360 --> 01:07:58.240]   he's not around, he's not coming.
[01:07:58.240 --> 01:08:01.340]   "All is continuing," in verse five,
[01:08:01.340 --> 01:08:03.260]   "for when they maintain this, it escapes their notice
[01:08:03.260 --> 01:08:05.540]   "that by the word of God, the heavens existed long ago,
[01:08:05.540 --> 01:08:09.180]   "and the earth was formed out of water and by water,
[01:08:09.180 --> 01:08:11.200]   "through which the world at that time was destroyed,
[01:08:11.200 --> 01:08:12.600]   "being flooded with water.
[01:08:12.600 --> 01:08:14.420]   "But by his word, the present heavens and earth
[01:08:14.420 --> 01:08:17.600]   "are being reserved for fire, kept for the day of judgment
[01:08:17.600 --> 01:08:19.600]   "and destruction of ungodly men."
[01:08:19.600 --> 01:08:23.480]   I mean, the people just look and laugh.
[01:08:23.480 --> 01:08:25.500]   The scary thing about this passage is that these people
[01:08:25.500 --> 01:08:27.280]   are people who believe in God,
[01:08:27.280 --> 01:08:29.800]   and they're saying, "Where is he?"
[01:08:29.800 --> 01:08:36.160]   You know, I was watching this movie,
[01:08:36.160 --> 01:08:39.140]   I highly don't recommend it, it's called 2012.
[01:08:39.140 --> 01:08:40.600]   It's a movie about the end of the world,
[01:08:40.600 --> 01:08:42.160]   but there's this one picture in the middle of it
[01:08:42.160 --> 01:08:43.920]   that was kind of funny.
[01:08:43.920 --> 01:08:46.080]   It's a homeless man saying the end is near.
[01:08:46.080 --> 01:08:50.160]   And then it's in the beginning of the movie
[01:08:50.160 --> 01:08:52.720]   before anybody really, I think this was 2012,
[01:08:52.720 --> 01:08:54.160]   anyway, it's in the beginning of the movie
[01:08:54.160 --> 01:08:56.760]   before anyone realizes that the world is coming to an end.
[01:08:56.760 --> 01:08:58.320]   So everyone, you know the beginning of a movie
[01:08:58.320 --> 01:08:59.840]   where they do character development?
[01:08:59.840 --> 01:09:01.720]   It's that, and you're like, the foreboding,
[01:09:01.720 --> 01:09:04.200]   the eeriness of it, like, everything seems so normal,
[01:09:04.200 --> 01:09:06.440]   but you know that the movie's called 2012,
[01:09:06.440 --> 01:09:08.760]   it's the end of the world then, and so you know, right?
[01:09:08.760 --> 01:09:11.080]   And so they're just walking by this homeless man,
[01:09:11.080 --> 01:09:13.480]   the end is near, prepare to meet thy maker,
[01:09:13.480 --> 01:09:15.480]   you know, that kind of thing.
[01:09:15.480 --> 01:09:19.800]   And he's being shown as a crazy man, right?
[01:09:19.800 --> 01:09:23.520]   Holding up this sign, like, prepare to meet thy maker.
[01:09:23.520 --> 01:09:24.720]   Like, what's so wrong with that sign?
[01:09:24.720 --> 01:09:25.920]   Isn't that a great sign?
[01:09:25.920 --> 01:09:28.840]   Isn't that such a truthful sign?
[01:09:28.840 --> 01:09:33.120]   But the reality is, later on,
[01:09:33.120 --> 01:09:34.920]   like, when everything starts going crazy,
[01:09:34.920 --> 01:09:36.880]   it's like all these storms, waters come,
[01:09:36.880 --> 01:09:39.280]   tsunamis and earthquakes and stuff, you see that?
[01:09:39.280 --> 01:09:40.680]   You see in the middle of all the chaos
[01:09:40.680 --> 01:09:42.800]   a homeless man just standing right there in the middle,
[01:09:42.800 --> 01:09:43.800]   just holding that sign.
[01:09:43.800 --> 01:09:46.600]   And you're like, dude, I shouldn't be laughing at it,
[01:09:46.600 --> 01:09:48.240]   but it's kind of funny, you know?
[01:09:48.240 --> 01:09:50.880]   I don't, oh.
[01:09:50.880 --> 01:09:59.560]   Because when we see clearly, like, yeah.
[01:09:59.560 --> 01:10:04.440]   Like, when we see the world being torn apart,
[01:10:04.440 --> 01:10:06.360]   it's like, oh.
[01:10:09.200 --> 01:10:11.240]   That's what we see in the book of Revelation.
[01:10:11.240 --> 01:10:16.960]   But you know what's so crazy about the stubbornness
[01:10:16.960 --> 01:10:19.000]   and the rebellion of sinful hearts
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:20.080]   is that in the middle of that,
[01:10:20.080 --> 01:10:23.800]   they still refuse to bow the knee before God.
[01:10:23.800 --> 01:10:26.040]   It's not worth time.
[01:10:26.040 --> 01:10:30.760]   That would have changed anything about unbelieving hearts.
[01:10:30.760 --> 01:10:35.280]   This day will come suddenly.
[01:10:35.280 --> 01:10:37.640]   Matthew 25 is in the middle of the Olivet Discourse
[01:10:37.640 --> 01:10:39.640]   and Jesus is talking about the end time.
[01:10:39.640 --> 01:10:43.440]   And the point is clear because of the repetition
[01:10:43.440 --> 01:10:45.160]   in the Olivet Discourse.
[01:10:45.160 --> 01:10:46.440]   In chapter 24, verse 36,
[01:10:46.440 --> 01:10:48.160]   but of that day and hour no one knows,
[01:10:48.160 --> 01:10:49.360]   not even the angels of heaven,
[01:10:49.360 --> 01:10:51.000]   nor the Son, but the Father alone.
[01:10:51.000 --> 01:10:52.560]   Verse 42, therefore be on the alert,
[01:10:52.560 --> 01:10:54.920]   for you do not know which day your Lord is coming.
[01:10:54.920 --> 01:10:56.840]   Verse 44, for this reason you also must be ready,
[01:10:56.840 --> 01:10:58.480]   for the Son of Man is coming at an hour
[01:10:58.480 --> 01:10:59.800]   when you do not think you will.
[01:10:59.800 --> 01:11:02.160]   Verse 50, the master of that slave will come on a day
[01:11:02.160 --> 01:11:03.920]   when he does not expect him at an hour
[01:11:03.920 --> 01:11:05.000]   which he does not know.
[01:11:05.000 --> 01:11:09.680]   So the word I think we can captivate here is suddenly.
[01:11:09.680 --> 01:11:11.400]   We don't know when it's gonna come.
[01:11:11.400 --> 01:11:16.320]   I realized coming up out of that initial time
[01:11:16.320 --> 01:11:17.640]   of quarantine back in April,
[01:11:17.640 --> 01:11:19.440]   a lot more people seemed ready.
[01:11:19.440 --> 01:11:21.960]   It felt, I was very encouraged.
[01:11:21.960 --> 01:11:24.560]   Until I realized a couple months later,
[01:11:24.560 --> 01:11:28.360]   oh, things go back to normal.
[01:11:28.360 --> 01:11:31.000]   I mean we know that about our lives, right?
[01:11:31.000 --> 01:11:32.640]   When something crazy happens in our life,
[01:11:32.640 --> 01:11:35.960]   we get stricken with some illness or disease,
[01:11:35.960 --> 01:11:38.760]   and you're like, whoa, and you start living soberly.
[01:11:38.760 --> 01:11:41.080]   But soon after that, things go back to normal.
[01:11:41.080 --> 01:11:41.920]   We know that.
[01:11:41.920 --> 01:11:43.120]   We go to a funeral and we're like,
[01:11:43.120 --> 01:11:44.720]   oh my gosh, I have to change the way I live.
[01:11:44.720 --> 01:11:46.600]   And we leave the funeral, and after a while,
[01:11:46.600 --> 01:11:48.520]   we're like, we're going right back to what we were doing.
[01:11:48.520 --> 01:11:49.520]   It just happens.
[01:11:49.520 --> 01:11:53.680]   And it's crazy that a worldwide pandemic hit us,
[01:11:53.680 --> 01:11:56.660]   and months later, we're like, it became normal again.
[01:11:56.660 --> 01:11:59.960]   We just have to wear a mask and be careful.
[01:12:00.960 --> 01:12:03.280]   And when we lose clarity, we again begin
[01:12:03.280 --> 01:12:05.880]   to put our sights on things where we once again,
[01:12:05.880 --> 01:12:07.160]   we're like, man, this is sweet time.
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:09.000]   I can't wait for Jesus to return.
[01:12:09.000 --> 01:12:10.200]   And now again, we're thinking like,
[01:12:10.200 --> 01:12:12.000]   man, I can't wait for the restaurants to open
[01:12:12.000 --> 01:12:12.840]   so I can eat.
[01:12:12.840 --> 01:12:20.160]   I've heard this term, light at the end of the tunnel,
[01:12:20.160 --> 01:12:21.680]   so many times.
[01:12:21.680 --> 01:12:24.640]   Like, what light?
[01:12:24.640 --> 01:12:28.120]   I've seen pictures of people
[01:12:29.120 --> 01:12:31.440]   I've seen pictures of people getting vaccines
[01:12:31.440 --> 01:12:35.040]   and the whole room sobbing as if this is their salvation.
[01:12:35.040 --> 01:12:39.640]   To the unbeliever, this thing will not save them.
[01:12:39.640 --> 01:12:41.920]   Like, what light?
[01:12:41.920 --> 01:12:44.800]   Like, the end will come, and the end comes.
[01:12:44.800 --> 01:12:50.560]   And people think like, oh, like, where's God?
[01:12:50.560 --> 01:12:53.400]   Or I'll do it tomorrow, or I don't know, you know?
[01:12:53.400 --> 01:12:55.600]   Like, I'll just continue to living in the, I don't know.
[01:12:55.600 --> 01:12:57.480]   I don't think the bridesmaids are waiting
[01:12:57.480 --> 01:13:00.160]   for the groom to come or like, living all like,
[01:13:00.160 --> 01:13:02.840]   you know, like, what do you call that?
[01:13:02.840 --> 01:13:05.840]   Like, with malicious intent and all that kind of stuff.
[01:13:05.840 --> 01:13:07.440]   I think they were just kind of living their lives
[01:13:07.440 --> 01:13:08.760]   going like, ah, I should be ready.
[01:13:08.760 --> 01:13:11.640]   And as they went, like, it just hit them.
[01:13:11.640 --> 01:13:17.080]   For any unbelieving person that's listening today,
[01:13:17.080 --> 01:13:18.680]   it will come, and what are you gonna do
[01:13:18.680 --> 01:13:19.920]   when you meet your maker?
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:26.000]   There is no light at the end of the tunnel at that point.
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   (audience laughing)
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:32.680]   We cannot live in simple anticipation for our world
[01:13:32.680 --> 01:13:35.040]   to go back to the way it was, because at the end,
[01:13:35.040 --> 01:13:37.400]   the world is promised to be consumed.
[01:13:37.400 --> 01:13:45.160]   To conclude, I realized as I studied this passage,
[01:13:45.160 --> 01:13:48.440]   the final, for a final application point, just one,
[01:13:48.440 --> 01:13:50.720]   because this is the last sermon
[01:13:50.720 --> 01:13:52.800]   of the Sunday sermon of the year.
[01:13:52.800 --> 01:13:54.200]   I'm sorry that it's a little bit heavier,
[01:13:54.200 --> 01:13:55.600]   but I thought like, it was just so like,
[01:13:55.600 --> 01:13:57.800]   good thinking about the past year.
[01:13:57.800 --> 01:13:59.320]   Here's the final application point.
[01:13:59.320 --> 01:14:02.560]   I think the temptation is going to be
[01:14:02.560 --> 01:14:05.280]   to look at this and try to identify who I am.
[01:14:05.280 --> 01:14:07.200]   Am I the wise or the foolish?
[01:14:07.200 --> 01:14:08.800]   I think that's gonna be the temptation.
[01:14:08.800 --> 01:14:11.640]   But can I ask you today, not to try to just sit there
[01:14:11.640 --> 01:14:14.240]   and as a final application to identify who you are,
[01:14:14.240 --> 01:14:17.320]   but actually to take this as an exhortation.
[01:14:17.320 --> 01:14:21.320]   So not identification, but exhortation.
[01:14:21.320 --> 01:14:25.400]   Do you know what I mean by this?
[01:14:25.400 --> 01:14:28.440]   Not to sit there and say like, man, I'm living like,
[01:14:28.440 --> 01:14:30.320]   I think I might be a foolish person,
[01:14:30.320 --> 01:14:32.200]   or I think I'm a wise person,
[01:14:32.200 --> 01:14:34.120]   you're trying to convince yourself one way or the other.
[01:14:34.120 --> 01:14:37.980]   Instead of doing that, the whole point is, he's coming soon.
[01:14:37.980 --> 01:14:40.400]   So prepare.
[01:14:40.400 --> 01:14:44.880]   There's no reason to live in guilt here.
[01:14:44.880 --> 01:14:46.840]   There's no reason to look back and go like, oh my gosh,
[01:14:46.840 --> 01:14:48.760]   I'm so terrible because of this and that.
[01:14:48.760 --> 01:14:50.600]   And like, no, no, no, the point is here,
[01:14:50.600 --> 01:14:53.360]   like if you hear his voice today,
[01:14:54.760 --> 01:14:55.600]   then listen.
[01:14:55.600 --> 01:14:59.320]   Let this week be different.
[01:14:59.320 --> 01:15:03.880]   Wake up tomorrow and say, this world is passing away,
[01:15:03.880 --> 01:15:05.920]   I'm not going to live for it.
[01:15:05.920 --> 01:15:08.240]   I can't wait for Christ to come.
[01:15:08.240 --> 01:15:09.480]   Just do that.
[01:15:09.480 --> 01:15:12.880]   In Hebrews two and three, when it talks about today,
[01:15:12.880 --> 01:15:14.600]   if you hear his voice, do not harden your hearts
[01:15:14.600 --> 01:15:15.800]   as in the time of the wilderness.
[01:15:15.800 --> 01:15:17.360]   It's that, it's like, you don't have to sit there
[01:15:17.360 --> 01:15:19.240]   and be like, oh, just continue to live in the past.
[01:15:19.240 --> 01:15:22.340]   Just like today, if you hear the voice, listen.
[01:15:22.340 --> 01:15:23.680]   It's a lot simpler than we make it,
[01:15:23.680 --> 01:15:25.080]   where sometimes we think like,
[01:15:25.080 --> 01:15:26.760]   we have to do something to our hearts.
[01:15:26.760 --> 01:15:28.760]   Like, no, no, no, it's just obey.
[01:15:28.760 --> 01:15:30.080]   It's just surrender.
[01:15:30.080 --> 01:15:33.960]   I wanted to leave that as the final exhortation.
[01:15:33.960 --> 01:15:37.360]   'Cause at the end, as we usher in,
[01:15:37.360 --> 01:15:39.920]   I'm really excited for the New Year's Eve service.
[01:15:39.920 --> 01:15:41.040]   Even though it's gonna be online,
[01:15:41.040 --> 01:15:43.900]   I'm very excited for the coming year,
[01:15:43.900 --> 01:15:46.840]   even though the arbitrary calendar date changing,
[01:15:46.840 --> 01:15:48.000]   whatever's right.
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.080]   But still, it's a time to really reflect together.
[01:15:51.080 --> 01:15:51.920]   I love that.
[01:15:51.920 --> 01:15:54.440]   I love New Year's because we can reflect together.
[01:15:54.440 --> 01:15:57.600]   And I think there's power when Christians,
[01:15:57.600 --> 01:16:00.420]   collectively as a body, unified,
[01:16:00.420 --> 01:16:04.020]   do it together.
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:07.200]   Let's live for that kingdom.
[01:16:07.200 --> 01:16:09.040]   As opposed to all of us just living our own lives,
[01:16:09.040 --> 01:16:10.920]   trying our best to, you know.
[01:16:10.920 --> 01:16:15.280]   Okay, all right, let me pray first.
[01:16:15.280 --> 01:16:18.600]   Heavenly Father, I thank you for your word
[01:16:18.600 --> 01:16:21.960]   that is always so challenging to us,
[01:16:21.960 --> 01:16:24.320]   that when we read this simple parable,
[01:16:24.320 --> 01:16:29.320]   we realize what an unprepared heart actually shows about us.
[01:16:29.320 --> 01:16:35.960]   Father, for those of us who have grown so accustomed
[01:16:35.960 --> 01:16:38.120]   to just abiding in your grace,
[01:16:38.120 --> 01:16:40.520]   I pray, Lord, that we would remember
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:44.320]   that we can't continue to live in a love of this world.
[01:16:44.320 --> 01:16:47.680]   Father, would you help us to surrender our lives to you?
[01:16:48.520 --> 01:16:53.520]   Help us to remember that the all 100% surrendering
[01:16:53.520 --> 01:16:55.920]   that we did at the time of conversion
[01:16:55.920 --> 01:16:58.160]   is what we are called to every single moment
[01:16:58.160 --> 01:17:00.240]   of every day of our lives.
[01:17:00.240 --> 01:17:02.680]   Father, take it all because that is indeed
[01:17:02.680 --> 01:17:04.800]   how every believer actually desires
[01:17:04.800 --> 01:17:06.140]   to live deep down inside.
[01:17:06.140 --> 01:17:09.960]   So God, I pray that there would be no more lip service.
[01:17:09.960 --> 01:17:13.880]   Please, God, help us to live in accordance
[01:17:13.880 --> 01:17:15.440]   to our beliefs and our convictions.
[01:17:15.440 --> 01:17:16.880]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:17:17.880 --> 01:17:20.040]   - Church family, let's all rise together.
[01:17:20.040 --> 01:17:23.080]   I think Pastor Nate asked us to sing the song
[01:17:23.080 --> 01:17:25.720]   Christ, Our Hope in Life and Death.
[01:17:25.720 --> 01:17:28.040]   First verse is what is our hope in life and death?
[01:17:28.040 --> 01:17:30.880]   Christ alone, Christ alone.
[01:17:30.880 --> 01:17:33.840]   What is our only confidence?
[01:17:33.840 --> 01:17:35.640]   That our souls to him belong.
[01:17:35.640 --> 01:17:38.240]   Who holds our days within his hand?
[01:17:38.240 --> 01:17:40.740]   What comes apart from his command?
[01:17:40.740 --> 01:17:42.480]   And what will keep us to the end?
[01:17:42.480 --> 01:17:44.840]   The love of Christ in which we stand.
[01:17:44.840 --> 01:17:47.920]   So as we sing this, I pray that we find encouragement.
[01:17:47.920 --> 01:17:52.980]   (upbeat music)
