[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.760]   It says, "And I, brethren, could not speak to you as to spiritual men, but as to men
[00:00:06.760 --> 00:00:09.280]   of flesh, as to infants in Christ.
[00:00:09.280 --> 00:00:14.640]   I gave you milk to drink, not solid food, for you were not yet able to receive it.
[00:00:14.640 --> 00:00:20.800]   Indeed, even now you are not yet able, for you are still fleshly.
[00:00:20.800 --> 00:00:26.120]   For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly, and are you not
[00:00:26.120 --> 00:00:28.320]   walking like mere men?
[00:00:28.320 --> 00:00:32.600]   For when one says, 'I am of Paul,' and another, 'I am of Apollos,' are you not
[00:00:32.600 --> 00:00:34.680]   mere men?
[00:00:34.680 --> 00:00:40.000]   What then is Apollos, and what is Paul, servants through whom you believed, even as the Lord
[00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:42.480]   gave opportunity to each one?
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:47.180]   I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.
[00:00:47.180 --> 00:00:51.520]   So then neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything but God who causes
[00:00:51.520 --> 00:00:52.520]   the growth.
[00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:59.040]   Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according
[00:00:59.040 --> 00:01:00.800]   to his own labor.
[00:01:00.800 --> 00:01:05.280]   For we are God's fellow workers, you are God's field, God's building."
[00:01:05.280 --> 00:01:06.520]   Let's pray.
[00:01:06.520 --> 00:01:09.640]   God, we pray for wisdom insight.
[00:01:09.640 --> 00:01:13.640]   We pray, Lord, for attentive ears.
[00:01:13.640 --> 00:01:16.720]   That, God, we might hear what you have to say.
[00:01:16.720 --> 00:01:22.880]   Help us in our study to have just fruitful, Lord, both inspiration and conviction.
[00:01:22.880 --> 00:01:30.200]   God, that we might truly apply your teaching about unity within the church, about the existence
[00:01:30.200 --> 00:01:34.240]   of division and carnality within, amongst the body.
[00:01:34.240 --> 00:01:38.840]   I pray, Father, God, that all of us would be able to apply into those aspects of our
[00:01:38.840 --> 00:01:39.840]   lives.
[00:01:39.840 --> 00:01:42.520]   We thank you for your word in Christ's name.
[00:01:42.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   Amen.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:44.520]   Okay.
[00:01:44.520 --> 00:01:52.560]   So I want to begin by just simply focusing on this beginning portion, verse one of chapter
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:53.560]   three.
[00:01:53.560 --> 00:01:59.160]   And he says, "And I, brethren, could not speak to you as spiritual men, but as to men
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:02.360]   of flesh, as to infants in Christ."
[00:02:02.360 --> 00:02:03.360]   Okay.
[00:02:03.360 --> 00:02:08.120]   So Paul is expressing a sense of frustration.
[00:02:08.120 --> 00:02:15.520]   He's expressing a sense of, "I want to speak to you as spiritual people, but I can't."
[00:02:15.520 --> 00:02:16.720]   Right?
[00:02:16.720 --> 00:02:21.800]   But it's really interesting that he uses several terms to describe how they are.
[00:02:21.800 --> 00:02:26.480]   He describes them as men of flesh, and he describes them as infants of Christ, or in
[00:02:26.480 --> 00:02:27.480]   Christ.
[00:02:27.480 --> 00:02:31.840]   I want to ask you this beginning question, since it's the first verse is more so focused
[00:02:31.840 --> 00:02:41.520]   on Apostle Paul describing who they are, when you think of infants, what comes to mind?
[00:02:41.520 --> 00:02:46.720]   Or if you've kind of did the homework a little bit, what do you think is the description
[00:02:46.720 --> 00:02:48.680]   here of this infant?
[00:02:48.680 --> 00:02:50.360]   This infant in Christ?
[00:02:50.360 --> 00:02:56.520]   I thought you were raising your hand.
[00:02:56.520 --> 00:02:59.520]   Just scratching your head.
[00:02:59.520 --> 00:03:06.520]   How about Lone Ranger Matt?
[00:03:06.520 --> 00:03:09.520]   You don't have your team today.
[00:03:09.520 --> 00:03:19.520]   I think he's talking about a young fever, so that's just, you know, not from the darkness
[00:03:19.520 --> 00:03:24.520]   of the light, but still has a lot of fleshly struggles that are still in his life.
[00:03:24.520 --> 00:03:25.520]   Okay.
[00:03:25.520 --> 00:03:26.520]   So it could involve that.
[00:03:26.520 --> 00:03:27.520]   Yeah.
[00:03:27.520 --> 00:03:30.840]   I think that's what, you know, kind of clearly he's talking about.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:38.560]   He's like, you're like an infant in Christ, so maybe you are like a recent convert.
[00:03:38.560 --> 00:03:40.980]   You kind of don't know any better.
[00:03:40.980 --> 00:03:45.600]   Maybe you have some old habits that you're accustomed to.
[00:03:45.600 --> 00:03:52.240]   Maybe what you know to do and only know to do is certain things that pertain to the kind
[00:03:52.240 --> 00:03:57.200]   of, or you know, kind of contribute to the division that exists in the church.
[00:03:57.200 --> 00:04:02.880]   Anybody else have other thoughts of what it means to be an infancy?
[00:04:02.880 --> 00:04:06.720]   There are just some things maybe that come to mind when I say infant.
[00:04:06.720 --> 00:04:09.520]   Okay, cool.
[00:04:09.520 --> 00:04:12.800]   That's what it says here.
[00:04:12.800 --> 00:04:16.680]   They can't eat solid food and stuff like that.
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.480]   Infants require a lot of what?
[00:04:18.480 --> 00:04:19.480]   Spoon feeding.
[00:04:19.480 --> 00:04:22.120]   Infants require a lot of hands-on attention.
[00:04:22.120 --> 00:04:25.280]   Infants need to basically care in detail to every single thing they do.
[00:04:25.280 --> 00:04:28.200]   Are there any other things that kind of come to mind?
[00:04:28.200 --> 00:04:29.200]   Yes.
[00:04:29.200 --> 00:04:35.200]   I've heard that it's used differently for other religions.
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:42.200]   And so that it's important not to have one to mean anything, because that can be a big
[00:04:42.200 --> 00:04:43.200]   deal.
[00:04:43.200 --> 00:04:49.200]   I was studying the Bible, that passage that people translate into the Hebrew Bible.
[00:04:49.200 --> 00:04:50.200]   The Hebrew 6-1?
[00:04:50.200 --> 00:04:53.200]   And it's about the Spirit.
[00:04:53.200 --> 00:04:55.520]   It's different, yeah.
[00:04:55.520 --> 00:04:56.520]   It is different.
[00:04:56.520 --> 00:05:02.160]   So she was saying that you shouldn't, I guess, limit yourself to one idea of a term because
[00:05:02.160 --> 00:05:04.200]   it's used differently in the Bible.
[00:05:04.200 --> 00:05:05.200]   Absolutely.
[00:05:05.200 --> 00:05:09.320]   What I'm trying to do right now is kind of get your, what we would normally think to
[00:05:09.320 --> 00:05:15.240]   be infancy, and then contrast that with what in this context, this passage is saying.
[00:05:15.240 --> 00:05:17.840]   Thank you though, because you're absolutely right.
[00:05:17.840 --> 00:05:23.760]   The principle is look at the context for what it is, how it is using that term here in this
[00:05:23.760 --> 00:05:26.160]   passage, right?
[00:05:26.160 --> 00:05:29.920]   But some of the things that we think of are pertaining to that stuff.
[00:05:29.920 --> 00:05:32.600]   We just, that kind of stuff we talked about.
[00:05:32.600 --> 00:05:39.060]   Well, as we look at those details then, he's calling them infants, and we just mentioned
[00:05:39.060 --> 00:05:43.600]   that maybe, maybe perhaps, he's talking about the fact that they're acting like brand new
[00:05:43.600 --> 00:05:46.120]   Christians, like they just converted.
[00:05:46.120 --> 00:05:50.280]   Maybe he's talking about the fact that Apostle Paul has to spoon feed them everything.
[00:05:50.280 --> 00:05:56.440]   So we're kind of honing in on what he's intending to say by calling them infants.
[00:05:56.440 --> 00:06:00.400]   Because you've got to realize, that's pretty significant, you know, when you write a letter
[00:06:00.400 --> 00:06:06.360]   to somebody and you're telling them, you're just like a baby, big baby, you know.
[00:06:06.360 --> 00:06:09.560]   It's, you know, let's try to figure out what he's trying to say.
[00:06:09.560 --> 00:06:15.200]   Well, we want to ask, he does say in verse two, look, I gave you milk to drink and not
[00:06:15.200 --> 00:06:16.880]   solid food.
[00:06:16.880 --> 00:06:20.360]   This is part of what makes them infants, right?
[00:06:20.360 --> 00:06:27.600]   And so, what could he be referring to when he talks about milk, when he talks about solids?
[00:06:27.600 --> 00:06:31.720]   What is he referring to as he uses this metaphor?
[00:06:31.720 --> 00:06:39.200]   What do you guys think?
[00:06:39.200 --> 00:06:44.160]   Okay.
[00:06:44.160 --> 00:06:45.840]   So spiritual truths.
[00:06:45.840 --> 00:06:50.720]   So would you say solid food, like they're both in the category of spiritual truth or
[00:06:50.720 --> 00:06:59.200]   is solid foods like spiritual truths and doctrines and milk is something else?
[00:06:59.200 --> 00:07:19.560]   Okay.
[00:07:19.560 --> 00:07:20.560]   Be confident, Karen.
[00:07:20.560 --> 00:07:21.560]   Yes.
[00:07:21.560 --> 00:07:22.560]   Okay.
[00:07:22.560 --> 00:07:23.560]   Cool.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.560]   Okay.
[00:07:24.560 --> 00:07:29.560]   You guys hear what he was saying?
[00:07:29.560 --> 00:07:34.560]   All right.
[00:07:34.560 --> 00:07:43.280]   Good.
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:47.800]   Those are all like, both of what you're saying, he's not obviously explicit here, right?
[00:07:47.800 --> 00:07:52.120]   He doesn't expound on it and say milk is this and solid food is this.
[00:07:52.120 --> 00:07:55.760]   And I agree with you, Karen, that I think milk and obviously solid food belong to the
[00:07:55.760 --> 00:07:58.600]   same category of spiritual truth.
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:04.600]   And I like what you said about there's a difference between the depth, the difficulty to which
[00:08:04.600 --> 00:08:09.000]   you're able to understand, comprehend, right?
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:15.840]   Because and the reason why I'm having you guys think about this is because for us as
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:24.760]   an observation, typically when you think of stuff like this, say milk and solid food,
[00:08:24.760 --> 00:08:27.560]   sometimes we think purely on the level of intellectual knowledge.
[00:08:27.560 --> 00:08:30.100]   What do I mean by that?
[00:08:30.100 --> 00:08:34.800]   If you say, oh, this person's really kind of babyish in the way they think, they're
[00:08:34.800 --> 00:08:41.120]   not thinking deeply or, you know, when you talk about milk and when you talk about solid
[00:08:41.120 --> 00:08:45.480]   food, some of the people who like heavy theologies are like, oh, let's leave the milk and get
[00:08:45.480 --> 00:08:47.160]   into eschatology.
[00:08:47.160 --> 00:08:51.360]   Let's get into, you know, debates about, you know, the, the character of Jesus.
[00:08:51.360 --> 00:08:55.240]   Let's get into debates about Arianism and all this kind of stuff.
[00:08:55.240 --> 00:08:59.160]   Is that what solid food is, you know?
[00:08:59.160 --> 00:09:03.440]   And when you think baby, is that simply a lack of knowledge?
[00:09:03.440 --> 00:09:10.280]   The fact of the matter is we know from context that Apostle Paul, he addresses the Corinthians
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.480]   church, not as people who are ignorant.
[00:09:13.480 --> 00:09:17.720]   He addresses them not as people who intellectually are kind of slow and dumb.
[00:09:17.720 --> 00:09:21.760]   As a matter of fact, these people pride themselves on what knowledge.
[00:09:21.760 --> 00:09:23.320]   These people actually are very smart.
[00:09:23.320 --> 00:09:27.120]   They come from a culture where they love knowledge, right?
[00:09:27.120 --> 00:09:34.840]   So the issue here is he kind of introduces this idea or not an idea, a rebuke of them,
[00:09:34.840 --> 00:09:39.720]   their behavior and their attitude by addressing the fact that they are babies, not for a lack
[00:09:39.720 --> 00:09:48.040]   of knowledge, but because by, by their spiritual condition, they can't take spiritual truth.
[00:09:48.040 --> 00:09:49.220]   Right?
[00:09:49.220 --> 00:09:54.840]   He says the problem here in verse two, in the second half of verse two, he says, I gave
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:09:56.760]   you milk and not solid food.
[00:09:56.760 --> 00:09:57.760]   Why?
[00:09:57.760 --> 00:10:00.440]   For you are not yet able to receive it.
[00:10:00.440 --> 00:10:03.800]   Indeed, even now you are not able to receive it.
[00:10:03.800 --> 00:10:04.800]   Right?
[00:10:04.800 --> 00:10:05.800]   Even now you're not able.
[00:10:06.000 --> 00:10:12.360]   If you guys remember from week one in the Corinthians church and the church in Corinth,
[00:10:12.360 --> 00:10:18.400]   how long did apostle Paul stay at this church?
[00:10:18.400 --> 00:10:21.400]   If you don't know, if you don't remember, remember the like exact years or whatever,
[00:10:21.400 --> 00:10:25.800]   the months you can either say short time as in sometimes he stayed at certain churches
[00:10:25.800 --> 00:10:31.040]   only three months, six months longer would be like a year, year and a half, two years
[00:10:31.040 --> 00:10:35.140]   shorter long, long.
[00:10:35.140 --> 00:10:41.040]   As a matter of fact, he has, he has served and he has ministered in the church of Corinth,
[00:10:41.040 --> 00:10:43.840]   the longest out of all the churches.
[00:10:43.840 --> 00:10:45.400]   So you can imagine why he's getting frustrated.
[00:10:45.400 --> 00:10:51.480]   It's like you're like babies, but I've been teaching you for so long, right?
[00:10:51.480 --> 00:10:54.240]   The thing that he's getting at again is not because they were ignorant.
[00:10:54.240 --> 00:10:58.680]   It's not because a lack of knowledge, he's getting at something much deeper.
[00:10:58.680 --> 00:11:04.200]   And this is when for us, I kind of, I should have had you guys do it, but at the beginning
[00:11:04.200 --> 00:11:08.480]   of the section, I wanted you guys to note the conjunction words because what he's doing
[00:11:08.480 --> 00:11:10.480]   is he's building up a case.
[00:11:10.480 --> 00:11:11.920]   So do you guys notice it?
[00:11:11.920 --> 00:11:18.940]   He says, um, in verse two he says, I gave you milk to drink, not solid food for you
[00:11:18.940 --> 00:11:20.280]   are not yet able to receive.
[00:11:20.280 --> 00:11:24.780]   And then verse three, four, since there is jealousy and strife among you.
[00:11:24.780 --> 00:11:29.400]   So those reasons, remember the four can mean various things as well.
[00:11:29.400 --> 00:11:35.880]   Here he kind of uses the four as supporting evidences for what he just said, right?
[00:11:35.880 --> 00:11:38.360]   Supporting evidences for what he just said.
[00:11:38.360 --> 00:11:40.640]   And in verse three, what does he say?
[00:11:40.640 --> 00:11:46.920]   For since there is jealousy and strife among you, are you not fleshly?
[00:11:46.920 --> 00:11:48.280]   Okay.
[00:11:48.280 --> 00:11:57.160]   So if you go to letter C, I ask, he's been unpacking this rebuke, your babies, big babies.
[00:11:57.160 --> 00:12:04.360]   And in this rebuke of them being in infancy, he describes, or he tries to not tries, he
[00:12:04.360 --> 00:12:08.380]   calls them mere men or a fleshly man.
[00:12:08.380 --> 00:12:14.360]   Let me ask you just in your reading of verses one through four, okay.
[00:12:14.360 --> 00:12:19.040]   Verses one through four, the first half of that section, what are some of these descriptions?
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:37.800]   What kind of picture do we get of the infant person, the fleshly man?
[00:12:37.800 --> 00:12:38.800]   He's jealous.
[00:12:38.800 --> 00:12:41.200]   What else?
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:42.760]   Okay.
[00:12:42.760 --> 00:12:46.560]   Not spiritual.
[00:12:46.560 --> 00:12:49.480]   And he's in strife, right?
[00:12:49.480 --> 00:12:55.360]   So I left some blanks for you there and you guys can plug in the two, jealousy and strife.
[00:12:55.360 --> 00:12:56.400]   Okay.
[00:12:56.400 --> 00:13:00.840]   He says, jealousy is your carnality.
[00:13:00.840 --> 00:13:04.060]   Your jealousy is your fleshliness.
[00:13:04.060 --> 00:13:07.880]   It's your like base humanness.
[00:13:07.880 --> 00:13:10.480]   Do you find that a bit interesting at all?
[00:13:10.480 --> 00:13:15.240]   You know, because when we think of, oh, that guy is really fleshly.
[00:13:15.240 --> 00:13:19.720]   We think of real carnal appetites and typically it's sexual morality.
[00:13:19.720 --> 00:13:20.720]   Typically it's money.
[00:13:20.720 --> 00:13:23.280]   Typically it's power, right?
[00:13:23.280 --> 00:13:29.360]   It's really interesting to me that he highlights this idea of jealousy.
[00:13:29.360 --> 00:13:33.880]   And for us to think about that a little bit, I know this Bible study I'm doing a lot of
[00:13:33.880 --> 00:13:36.160]   like, well, what comes to your mind and what do you think?
[00:13:36.160 --> 00:13:38.920]   I'm going to do a bit more of that.
[00:13:38.920 --> 00:13:47.080]   When you think of a person who's jealous, how would you describe that person?
[00:13:47.080 --> 00:14:05.000]   What kind of things would he say, do and think this jealous man?
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:13.560]   How about some guys on that end?
[00:14:13.560 --> 00:14:14.880]   I wish I had what he had.
[00:14:14.880 --> 00:14:16.600]   That's a great definition.
[00:14:16.600 --> 00:14:22.880]   This kind of begrudging desire to have what someone else possesses, right?
[00:14:22.880 --> 00:14:31.120]   And if you think about, um, think about this for a moment, the 10 commandments.
[00:14:31.120 --> 00:14:37.120]   Within the 10 commandments, you realize God from the really early beginning addressed
[00:14:37.120 --> 00:14:38.400]   issues of jealousy.
[00:14:38.400 --> 00:14:41.480]   You shall not covet your neighbor's wife.
[00:14:41.480 --> 00:14:45.040]   You shall not covet this and that, right?
[00:14:45.040 --> 00:14:47.520]   What else comes to mind when you think of a jealous person?
[00:14:47.520 --> 00:14:48.520]   Is that it?
[00:14:48.520 --> 00:14:54.720]   Jealous person just, you know, just wants what that guy has.
[00:14:54.720 --> 00:14:56.560]   Probably anger, frustration.
[00:14:56.560 --> 00:14:59.840]   If he finds himself in a position where he thinks, I don't have.
[00:14:59.840 --> 00:15:09.880]   He can get extremely bitter, discontent, just not happy, not happy with his plot in life
[00:15:09.880 --> 00:15:12.480]   and can't be happy for other people either.
[00:15:12.480 --> 00:15:19.520]   How can you be happy when you're sitting there looking at the person with jealous eyes?
[00:15:19.520 --> 00:15:20.520]   Anything else?
[00:15:20.520 --> 00:15:21.520]   Divisive.
[00:15:21.520 --> 00:15:22.520]   Yeah.
[00:15:22.520 --> 00:15:35.360]   There's a sense in which jealousy, that kind of, um, attitude in the heart that says, I
[00:15:35.360 --> 00:15:38.640]   can't bear to see that guy have more than me.
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:40.520]   So he always had to win.
[00:15:40.520 --> 00:15:43.540]   The kind of jealousy where you can't lose.
[00:15:43.540 --> 00:15:46.680]   So don't ever, you know, touch my possessions.
[00:15:46.680 --> 00:15:49.980]   Don't ever, you know, they're very overly protective.
[00:15:49.980 --> 00:15:55.500]   The stuff that we said earlier where they're, you know, like wanting the possessions of
[00:15:55.500 --> 00:15:57.960]   others and all that kind of stuff.
[00:15:57.960 --> 00:16:00.800]   These things naturally lead to what?
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:01.800]   Divisiveness.
[00:16:01.800 --> 00:16:02.800]   Divisiveness.
[00:16:02.800 --> 00:16:05.840]   In jealousy, they're willing to what?
[00:16:05.840 --> 00:16:06.840]   Hurt others.
[00:16:06.840 --> 00:16:07.840]   They're willing to step on others.
[00:16:07.840 --> 00:16:10.800]   They're willing to do what it takes so that I might gain.
[00:16:10.800 --> 00:16:12.760]   In their discontentment.
[00:16:12.760 --> 00:16:14.760]   That's what they would do.
[00:16:14.760 --> 00:16:19.020]   So what I'm saying is this, is there is a trail of thought, right?
[00:16:19.020 --> 00:16:21.040]   He says, you guys are infants.
[00:16:21.040 --> 00:16:25.840]   He says, you're infants because you're not able to receive spiritually what the spirit
[00:16:25.840 --> 00:16:27.760]   of God has to say to you.
[00:16:27.760 --> 00:16:32.360]   And he unpacks it and says, this infancy is marked by fleshliness, carnality.
[00:16:32.360 --> 00:16:33.960]   And what is this fleshless?
[00:16:33.960 --> 00:16:38.680]   It's not what we think typically, which is just this kind of abhorrent, base, sexual
[00:16:38.680 --> 00:16:40.680]   desire or whatnot.
[00:16:40.680 --> 00:16:43.560]   It's broadly speaking, your jealous heart.
[00:16:43.560 --> 00:16:44.560]   Right?
[00:16:45.100 --> 00:16:50.540]   And he says, this jealous heart in you has caused strife, has caused division within
[00:16:50.540 --> 00:16:52.860]   the church.
[00:16:52.860 --> 00:17:00.020]   People then in their jealousy competing probably for leadership positions, probably for power,
[00:17:00.020 --> 00:17:01.780]   probably for clout and authority.
[00:17:01.780 --> 00:17:06.340]   If I say I've got the teachings of Paulus, that's one thing.
[00:17:06.340 --> 00:17:12.900]   If I say I've got the teaching of a Paulus and you don't, now who has a position of authority?
[00:17:12.900 --> 00:17:13.900]   Me.
[00:17:13.900 --> 00:17:15.820]   You see what I'm saying?
[00:17:15.820 --> 00:17:20.100]   So the people, the men in the church were using their allegiance to leaders in the church
[00:17:20.100 --> 00:17:25.460]   to gain greater leadership, greater notoriety, greater titles.
[00:17:25.460 --> 00:17:26.460]   Okay?
[00:17:26.460 --> 00:17:28.700]   That we covered a bit earlier.
[00:17:28.700 --> 00:17:34.540]   So all I'm saying is there is this contrast he's building up and he's saying, Paulus
[00:17:34.540 --> 00:17:37.260]   and Paulus has been expecting them.
[00:17:37.260 --> 00:17:43.420]   After what I believe is, you know, well over a year, probably like 18 months or so, spending
[00:17:43.420 --> 00:17:48.220]   time with this church, investing into them, dealing with their problems.
[00:17:48.220 --> 00:17:53.780]   He expects them to be more mature, but he says, but you're not spiritual right now.
[00:17:53.780 --> 00:17:55.340]   You know?
[00:17:55.340 --> 00:18:03.720]   And so we have to take a, you know, take a moment to kind of encapsulate this point from
[00:18:03.720 --> 00:18:05.580]   verses one through four.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:11.420]   And I asked this question, in verses one through four, what is he trying to prove to the men?
[00:18:11.420 --> 00:18:14.140]   What is he trying to argue to them?
[00:18:14.140 --> 00:18:15.900]   Right?
[00:18:15.900 --> 00:18:20.140]   Because in trying to do this, he's making a direct rebuke, but what is he convincing
[00:18:20.140 --> 00:18:24.540]   them of?
[00:18:24.540 --> 00:18:30.020]   Okay.
[00:18:30.020 --> 00:18:34.420]   So my hint is, takeaway point number one.
[00:18:34.420 --> 00:18:42.460]   There is a sense in which before in the previous sections, Apostle Paul was talking about the
[00:18:42.460 --> 00:18:48.300]   worldly principles in the environment, in the world.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:54.260]   So he was saying, you know, there is a worldly philosophy, there's worldly wisdom, right?
[00:18:54.260 --> 00:19:09.860]   However, now in this passage, we're talking about, let me phrase it this way.
[00:19:09.860 --> 00:19:12.540]   Sometimes we like to blame stuff.
[00:19:12.540 --> 00:19:16.940]   Before we're talking about the wisdom of the world, the wisdom of this age, the wisdom
[00:19:16.940 --> 00:19:18.020]   of the rulers.
[00:19:18.020 --> 00:19:22.340]   That's all what?
[00:19:22.340 --> 00:19:24.020]   Out there, external.
[00:19:24.020 --> 00:19:28.780]   But here now, what is Apostle Paul really trying to convince them?
[00:19:28.780 --> 00:19:30.740]   That the problem is?
[00:19:30.740 --> 00:19:32.220]   Yeah.
[00:19:32.220 --> 00:19:37.260]   So he says, he's essentially saying, your attitude is jealous.
[00:19:37.260 --> 00:19:38.740]   That's your heart issue.
[00:19:38.740 --> 00:19:43.580]   So now we're talking about the pressures and enticements of their own heart.
[00:19:43.580 --> 00:19:45.540]   So that's the blank there.
[00:19:45.540 --> 00:19:50.300]   Before Apostle Paul's rebuked them and said, you're just buying into all this worldly philosophy.
[00:19:50.300 --> 00:19:55.340]   Your Greek philosopher told you you were stupid, so you didn't want to be stupid anymore.
[00:19:55.340 --> 00:19:57.820]   So now you're buying into his philosophy.
[00:19:57.820 --> 00:20:04.460]   And the world rulers have what they define as authority and power, and now you want it.
[00:20:04.460 --> 00:20:08.740]   So on that end, it's kind of like you have external enticements that keep saying, buy
[00:20:08.740 --> 00:20:13.100]   into our world system, buy into our world system.
[00:20:13.100 --> 00:20:19.460]   But there's something that Apostle Paul wants every person there to admit.
[00:20:19.460 --> 00:20:25.620]   More so than anything, those external enticements work because there is an internal pressure.
[00:20:25.620 --> 00:20:31.460]   There is a heart issue of jealousy, and that's an attitude of the heart.
[00:20:31.460 --> 00:20:32.460]   Okay?
[00:20:32.460 --> 00:20:36.980]   You guys see that?
[00:20:36.980 --> 00:20:43.560]   Now there's a second takeaway point from verses one through four, and it's an obvious one.
[00:20:43.560 --> 00:20:48.200]   So I asked this question, okay, like, what is Paul really frustrated about?
[00:20:48.200 --> 00:20:52.180]   What does it reveal about what he expects from the church?
[00:20:52.180 --> 00:20:56.860]   Now what I'm saying is, Apostle Paul knows the flesh, you know?
[00:20:56.860 --> 00:21:03.060]   In Romans chapter seven, he knows what it means to battle with his flesh, his humanness.
[00:21:03.060 --> 00:21:05.900]   And in many parts of scripture, he acknowledges, I'm a sinner.
[00:21:05.900 --> 00:21:07.220]   I'm the foremost of sinners.
[00:21:07.220 --> 00:21:09.100]   I know what it means to sin.
[00:21:09.100 --> 00:21:10.760]   I know what it means to have sinful desires.
[00:21:10.760 --> 00:21:16.580]   So there's a sense for me as I think about this passage, he's not necessarily frustrated
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:23.940]   that there exists flesh, because he's the one who teaches us, right?
[00:21:23.940 --> 00:21:29.340]   That although we're saved, there exists sinful flesh in this day and age.
[00:21:29.340 --> 00:21:33.860]   And until glorification, we're going to wrestle with it every day.
[00:21:33.860 --> 00:21:46.340]   What is his main frustration though, with them?
[00:21:46.340 --> 00:21:48.700]   I'll give you a hint.
[00:21:48.700 --> 00:21:54.460]   I think it's found in verse two.
[00:21:54.460 --> 00:22:02.740]   Yeah, absolutely.
[00:22:02.740 --> 00:22:07.000]   The lack of growth, the lack of growth.
[00:22:07.000 --> 00:22:11.280]   So takeaway point number two.
[00:22:11.280 --> 00:22:18.320]   Although sin and flesh continue to exist, and they are expected, maturity and tangible
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:22.960]   change are the norm for Christians.
[00:22:22.960 --> 00:22:27.640]   Maturity and tangible change are the norm for Christians.
[00:22:27.640 --> 00:22:30.560]   I guess you can say not maturity, but maturation.
[00:22:30.560 --> 00:22:35.960]   The growth and tangible changing.
[00:22:35.960 --> 00:22:37.680]   That's the norm for Christians.
[00:22:37.680 --> 00:22:44.300]   You might have started off as like persecuted the church, pagan to the core, but no matter
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:48.560]   where you start, what does God expect of you?
[00:22:48.560 --> 00:22:50.840]   To slowly change, right?
[00:22:50.840 --> 00:22:51.840]   It's totally honest.
[00:22:51.840 --> 00:22:54.840]   You know that song that goes, "He's changed, me."
[00:22:54.840 --> 00:22:59.400]   And then there's that little part that goes, "Although it's slow going, but there's the
[00:22:59.400 --> 00:23:00.400]   knowing."
[00:23:00.400 --> 00:23:02.720]   I was like, one day I was just like thinking about that.
[00:23:02.720 --> 00:23:03.720]   It's like, it's so true.
[00:23:03.720 --> 00:23:10.280]   You know, like change is a little slow and you know, all that stuff, but he's like, he's
[00:23:10.280 --> 00:23:16.160]   changing us and it might be different paces, but the expectation is there still has to
[00:23:16.160 --> 00:23:19.080]   be change.
[00:23:19.080 --> 00:23:26.280]   And I want to use this as a point here is like, you know, the other day, like I was
[00:23:26.280 --> 00:23:30.720]   spoon feeding Emmett and Bia just looked at me and said, "Let him feed himself."
[00:23:30.720 --> 00:23:32.680]   And I was like, "Whoa."
[00:23:32.680 --> 00:23:34.600]   And then she's like, "Yeah, he's already over two."
[00:23:34.600 --> 00:23:36.960]   And I was like, "You're right.
[00:23:36.960 --> 00:23:37.960]   Feed yourself, man."
[00:23:37.960 --> 00:23:42.600]   The thing about it is he knows how.
[00:23:42.600 --> 00:23:48.880]   He's actually, Emmett is more, I guess, coordinated than Yoshi is, but he totally knows how to
[00:23:48.880 --> 00:23:49.880]   manipulate you.
[00:23:49.880 --> 00:23:50.880]   He's like, "But I'm tired, Appa.
[00:23:50.880 --> 00:23:51.880]   Feed me."
[00:23:51.880 --> 00:23:52.880]   And I was like, "Your mother's right.
[00:23:52.880 --> 00:23:53.880]   You're over two.
[00:23:53.880 --> 00:23:54.880]   Feed yourself."
[00:23:54.880 --> 00:23:59.720]   Well, here's the thing though.
[00:23:59.720 --> 00:24:02.440]   Right now, kids do stuff that's cute.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:06.720]   You know, so there's other kids, you know, when they do stuff like hit the baseball off
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:08.400]   the tee, it's great.
[00:24:08.400 --> 00:24:12.480]   When they do stuff like say string together sentences, it's great.
[00:24:12.480 --> 00:24:17.360]   Even if they have that, like they can't pronounce the R's and it sounds like W's and all that
[00:24:17.360 --> 00:24:20.640]   stuff, it's all cute.
[00:24:20.640 --> 00:24:24.200]   But if a 20 year old guy pronounces R's like W's, they're not going to say, "Oh, that's
[00:24:24.200 --> 00:24:25.200]   so cute.
[00:24:25.200 --> 00:24:26.200]   I want to date him.
[00:24:26.200 --> 00:24:27.200]   Hello."
[00:24:27.200 --> 00:24:32.640]   It's not cute.
[00:24:32.640 --> 00:24:33.640]   It's sad.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:38.080]   It's like, "Uh, no one talked to you about that?"
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.520]   And if they're still hitting off the tee, it's not cute.
[00:24:41.520 --> 00:24:44.820]   If they're still running to second base rather than first base, it's not cute.
[00:24:44.820 --> 00:24:47.040]   If they still don't know how to feed themselves, it's not cute.
[00:24:47.040 --> 00:24:49.920]   It's sad.
[00:24:49.920 --> 00:24:53.000]   The expectation is you need to grow.
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:56.080]   And he expected these people to grow.
[00:24:56.080 --> 00:24:57.840]   He expected them to grow.
[00:24:57.840 --> 00:24:59.040]   And what was he frustrated about?
[00:24:59.040 --> 00:25:01.560]   It wasn't so much just a simple existence of flesh.
[00:25:01.560 --> 00:25:03.080]   That's my point.
[00:25:03.080 --> 00:25:05.700]   Because we all struggle with our flesh.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:07.800]   We all struggle with sin.
[00:25:07.800 --> 00:25:11.160]   We all struggle with the stains of our previous life.
[00:25:11.160 --> 00:25:14.280]   And God is changing us, but that's the key.
[00:25:14.280 --> 00:25:19.080]   Apostle Paul says in verse two, "Even now."
[00:25:19.080 --> 00:25:23.320]   That's where I think, okay, Apostle Paul's a bit frustrated.
[00:25:23.320 --> 00:25:25.880]   Even now you still can't take it.
[00:25:25.880 --> 00:25:28.840]   You can't be babies anymore.
[00:25:28.840 --> 00:25:31.280]   And we have to hear that sometimes, you know?
[00:25:31.280 --> 00:25:36.600]   I hear guys when I ask them questions, I just don't like this statement.
[00:25:36.600 --> 00:25:38.240]   It's like when I ask them, "How are you doing?"
[00:25:38.240 --> 00:25:39.240]   They're like, "Things are good."
[00:25:39.240 --> 00:25:41.240]   I say, "What do you mean things are good?"
[00:25:41.240 --> 00:25:43.200]   And they're like, "It's just the same old.
[00:25:43.200 --> 00:25:45.320]   Just keeps plateauing a little bit."
[00:25:45.320 --> 00:25:50.640]   And I'm just like, "That's not reality."
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:51.640]   You know?
[00:25:51.640 --> 00:25:53.720]   You don't ever just plateau.
[00:25:53.720 --> 00:25:55.740]   You don't ever just stay the same.
[00:25:55.740 --> 00:25:59.960]   If I don't talk to my wife, Bia, for three months, I don't say, "Oh yeah, our relationship's
[00:25:59.960 --> 00:26:01.120]   just staying the same."
[00:26:01.120 --> 00:26:05.680]   No, our relationship's about to crash and go to the pits and she's gonna leave me, you
[00:26:05.680 --> 00:26:06.680]   know?
[00:26:06.680 --> 00:26:10.880]   As time goes by, things just don't stay the same.
[00:26:10.880 --> 00:26:13.200]   And that's a misconception.
[00:26:13.200 --> 00:26:14.200]   It's a lie.
[00:26:14.200 --> 00:26:17.360]   Your relationship with God does not stay the same.
[00:26:17.360 --> 00:26:20.100]   God expects growth.
[00:26:20.100 --> 00:26:22.720]   God expects continual interaction.
[00:26:22.720 --> 00:26:25.040]   God expects continual maturity.
[00:26:25.040 --> 00:26:29.760]   And I think that's what Apostle Paul is frustrated with these men.
[00:26:29.760 --> 00:26:33.840]   And I want you guys to just think about that a little bit, you know?
[00:26:33.840 --> 00:26:41.120]   The expectation for us, I feel like in recent days, there has been this kind of like wide-scale
[00:26:41.120 --> 00:26:44.200]   acceptance of failure.
[00:26:44.200 --> 00:26:47.600]   And there was this commentator on the blogs who said, "You know, there exists in this
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:54.640]   day and age of failureism where they almost like just kind of acknowledge and then accept
[00:26:54.640 --> 00:26:57.880]   the fact there's just gonna be a whole lot of failure.
[00:26:57.880 --> 00:27:02.200]   And so the only thing we can say about it is it's okay because you're in Christ."
[00:27:02.200 --> 00:27:10.120]   For me, Apostle Paul is not convincing them of their position in Christ to say, "Oh, you're
[00:27:10.120 --> 00:27:12.920]   in Christ and so therefore everything's okay."
[00:27:12.920 --> 00:27:17.240]   Apostle Paul's not talking about position, he's talking about practice.
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:19.600]   In practice, you're a baby.
[00:27:19.600 --> 00:27:21.480]   Are these people Christians that he's talking to?
[00:27:21.480 --> 00:27:27.880]   I think so because he says, "Brethren," and he says, "in Christ."
[00:27:27.880 --> 00:27:35.400]   So the point being here again is what Apostle Paul expects is maturity from the Christian.
[00:27:35.400 --> 00:27:40.200]   Expression of growth needs to exist.
[00:27:40.200 --> 00:27:47.800]   Any questions about verses one through four, the first paragraph?
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:53.640]   Okay, then verses five through nine.
[00:27:53.640 --> 00:27:58.040]   Let's read it first and it says, "What then is Apollos?"
[00:27:58.040 --> 00:28:04.280]   So you can see from here that he connects this section with the verses in chapter one,
[00:28:04.280 --> 00:28:05.280]   right?
[00:28:05.280 --> 00:28:06.440]   Because he mentions the same thing.
[00:28:06.440 --> 00:28:10.560]   "What then is Apollos and what is Paul?"
[00:28:10.560 --> 00:28:15.240]   He asks this question and then he answers, "Servants through whom you believed, even
[00:28:15.240 --> 00:28:17.920]   as the Lord gave opportunity to each one.
[00:28:17.920 --> 00:28:22.100]   I planted, Apollos watered, but God was causing the growth.
[00:28:22.100 --> 00:28:26.880]   So then, neither the one who plants nor the one who waters is anything, but God who causes
[00:28:26.880 --> 00:28:27.880]   the growth.
[00:28:27.880 --> 00:28:33.760]   Now, he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according
[00:28:33.760 --> 00:28:35.240]   to his own labor.
[00:28:35.240 --> 00:28:39.240]   For we are God's fellow workers, you are God's field, God's building."
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:45.880]   All right, we're going to ask a question, a broad question, and we're going to leave
[00:28:45.880 --> 00:28:51.560]   it to B. And the question is, what's the main point he's making?
[00:28:51.560 --> 00:28:56.920]   And then secondly, how is this point connecting with the first paragraph, verses one through
[00:28:56.920 --> 00:28:57.920]   four?
[00:28:57.920 --> 00:28:58.920]   Okay?
[00:28:58.920 --> 00:29:02.800]   In order to answer that question, let's look at just the details.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.360]   All right?
[00:29:04.360 --> 00:29:07.840]   So verse five says, "What is Apollos and what is Paul?"
[00:29:07.840 --> 00:29:12.280]   I know this again is kind of a more obvious question, but I want you guys to think about
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:13.800]   it for a second.
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:22.920]   How does Paul view himself and his fellow teachers like Apollos?
[00:29:22.920 --> 00:29:31.640]   Good.
[00:29:31.640 --> 00:29:36.040]   If I didn't leave three blanks in there, Kevin just added another one.
[00:29:36.040 --> 00:29:37.040]   Equally.
[00:29:37.040 --> 00:29:38.040]   Okay?
[00:29:38.040 --> 00:29:40.560]   How does Apostle Paul view himself and the fellow teachers?
[00:29:40.560 --> 00:29:41.560]   He does.
[00:29:41.560 --> 00:29:49.480]   He views himself and Apollos, who is Apostle Paul's understudy.
[00:29:49.480 --> 00:29:50.920]   Okay?
[00:29:50.920 --> 00:29:54.000]   He views it all equally.
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:57.240]   What else?
[00:29:57.240 --> 00:29:58.600]   Just as servants.
[00:29:58.600 --> 00:29:59.600]   Okay?
[00:29:59.600 --> 00:30:06.760]   Whereas perhaps the church people were looking at them like, "Oh, he's my leader.
[00:30:06.760 --> 00:30:08.960]   He's our representative."
[00:30:08.960 --> 00:30:12.760]   Apostle Paul looked at himself like, "I am your servant.
[00:30:12.760 --> 00:30:13.760]   I am God's servant."
[00:30:13.760 --> 00:30:15.800]   Okay?
[00:30:15.800 --> 00:30:17.560]   Anything else that you can kind of glean?
[00:30:17.560 --> 00:30:21.200]   I don't want you to necessarily milk it, but there's some other stuff you can draw from
[00:30:21.200 --> 00:30:25.760]   how he views himself and his fellow teachers.
[00:30:25.760 --> 00:30:28.240]   Great.
[00:30:28.240 --> 00:30:30.760]   Insignificant.
[00:30:30.760 --> 00:30:33.120]   Okay?
[00:30:33.120 --> 00:30:35.000]   That's an important one.
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:38.440]   Anything else?
[00:30:38.440 --> 00:30:40.720]   Who said that?
[00:30:40.720 --> 00:30:43.240]   He said gardeners.
[00:30:43.240 --> 00:30:45.160]   Maybe just like role players or something.
[00:30:45.160 --> 00:30:48.560]   Or like just, you know, just a worker.
[00:30:48.560 --> 00:30:50.280]   Just a task guy.
[00:30:50.280 --> 00:30:54.720]   You know?
[00:30:54.720 --> 00:30:56.120]   Now good.
[00:30:56.120 --> 00:31:01.240]   So I think for me, the point here, the reason why I asked that question is because the point
[00:31:01.240 --> 00:31:07.120]   in verse five through nine, he's giving them how he is viewing the scenario.
[00:31:07.120 --> 00:31:08.120]   Okay?
[00:31:08.120 --> 00:31:13.520]   The problem was these church guys had a really worldly way of viewing their involvement in
[00:31:13.520 --> 00:31:15.520]   the church and the involvement of leaders.
[00:31:15.520 --> 00:31:17.800]   Now he's giving his perspective.
[00:31:17.800 --> 00:31:23.640]   And in so doing, we gain that his perspective on himself and the fellow coworkers is very
[00:31:23.640 --> 00:31:26.040]   different from what's normal.
[00:31:26.040 --> 00:31:27.640]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:31:27.640 --> 00:31:35.320]   Like I'm going to confess, it's hard.
[00:31:35.320 --> 00:31:39.560]   Sometimes my nature wants to run things like a business at the church.
[00:31:39.560 --> 00:31:41.480]   So I want structure, levels of authority.
[00:31:41.480 --> 00:31:43.840]   This guy's like this and this guy has this and this guy has that.
[00:31:43.840 --> 00:31:48.320]   And then when this guy gives an order, just execute, you know?
[00:31:48.320 --> 00:31:53.320]   And not only that, but a lot of people in ministry, they do want a title because title
[00:31:53.320 --> 00:31:54.560]   makes a huge difference.
[00:31:54.560 --> 00:31:55.560]   Right?
[00:31:55.560 --> 00:32:00.000]   You know, you get treated when you have a title pastor or have a title deacon or have
[00:32:00.000 --> 00:32:03.300]   a title of this and that, servant team leader, whatever.
[00:32:03.300 --> 00:32:07.040]   It does make a practical difference on how people treat and view you.
[00:32:07.040 --> 00:32:09.920]   That's reality, right?
[00:32:09.920 --> 00:32:16.160]   So by way of confession, all of those intricate kind of balances exist, right?
[00:32:16.160 --> 00:32:24.400]   Now what's challenging is apostle Paul has a very counterintuitive, has a very clear
[00:32:24.400 --> 00:32:26.760]   vision of how he views himself.
[00:32:26.760 --> 00:32:30.200]   But more importantly, he has a clear view of God.
[00:32:30.200 --> 00:32:35.160]   My question to you is, how does apostle Paul view God in this scenario?
[00:32:35.160 --> 00:32:36.160]   How would you sum it up?
[00:32:36.160 --> 00:32:48.360]   If you had to choose one word, how is God seen in this scenario?
[00:32:48.360 --> 00:32:53.960]   Looking at the passage, you can even use the gardening example metaphor.
[00:32:53.960 --> 00:32:56.400]   Master?
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.920]   Okay, good.
[00:33:00.920 --> 00:33:03.640]   Master.
[00:33:03.640 --> 00:33:06.920]   For me, I just put big boss.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:09.960]   He's the boss.
[00:33:09.960 --> 00:33:14.200]   Because he's the one who gives the people the task.
[00:33:14.200 --> 00:33:16.880]   He gives the people the opportunity.
[00:33:16.880 --> 00:33:21.480]   It's kind of like, when we say, "Oh, someone so and so gave me an opportunity," we're saying
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:23.480]   they hired us.
[00:33:23.480 --> 00:33:26.440]   This person gave us this networking thing and he gave us a way in.
[00:33:26.440 --> 00:33:28.320]   That person probably is in a hiring position.
[00:33:28.320 --> 00:33:30.720]   He's the boss, right?
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:38.580]   What's more than that too though, is letter C, God caused the growth.
[00:33:38.580 --> 00:33:45.000]   To do that, basically this is, perhaps this doesn't feel or doesn't sound like, "Oh wow,"
[00:33:45.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   to you.
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:53.400]   But how many people do you know who can guarantee success?
[00:33:53.400 --> 00:33:54.920]   Business people can promise it.
[00:33:54.920 --> 00:33:59.240]   They'll promise you, "Oh, if you make this investment, I think it's going to be double
[00:33:59.240 --> 00:34:00.240]   the investment.
[00:34:00.240 --> 00:34:02.120]   You'll double your money."
[00:34:02.120 --> 00:34:04.560]   Or they'll say, "I promise you this is going to be a win-win.
[00:34:04.560 --> 00:34:05.920]   I promise you this and this and that."
[00:34:05.920 --> 00:34:07.840]   That's the best they can do.
[00:34:07.840 --> 00:34:10.880]   Who do you know who can promise results?
[00:34:10.880 --> 00:34:12.440]   Success?
[00:34:12.440 --> 00:34:14.000]   Growth?
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:15.800]   God.
[00:34:15.800 --> 00:34:18.840]   He's in absolute control.
[00:34:18.840 --> 00:34:20.840]   Absolute control.
[00:34:20.840 --> 00:34:24.400]   And I love that about Apostle Paul's perspective.
[00:34:24.400 --> 00:34:29.640]   For us, although we know in reality we're not in control of the results, we always think
[00:34:29.640 --> 00:34:30.640]   it is.
[00:34:30.640 --> 00:34:33.280]   We have a one-to-one linear thinking.
[00:34:33.280 --> 00:34:36.360]   If I put in the time, the results will happen.
[00:34:36.360 --> 00:34:40.600]   If I exert this kind of energy, if I invest that, then the results will come.
[00:34:40.600 --> 00:34:43.800]   And then, when the results aren't there, you know what we're prone to do?
[00:34:43.800 --> 00:34:44.960]   And therefore I'm doing something wrong.
[00:34:44.960 --> 00:34:47.400]   Now I need to change it.
[00:34:47.400 --> 00:34:49.200]   That's typically how we think.
[00:34:49.200 --> 00:34:50.760]   It's hard not to think like that.
[00:34:50.760 --> 00:34:53.720]   Because we're so short-sighted.
[00:34:53.720 --> 00:34:55.040]   Apostle Paul has this perspective.
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:34:58.560]   He says basically, look, verse 7.
[00:34:58.560 --> 00:35:00.800]   Somebody said over here, "They're nothing."
[00:35:00.800 --> 00:35:01.800]   That's so important.
[00:35:01.800 --> 00:35:06.800]   He says, "So then neither the one who plants or the one who waters is anything but God
[00:35:06.800 --> 00:35:08.320]   who causes the growth."
[00:35:08.320 --> 00:35:11.200]   God then is everything.
[00:35:11.200 --> 00:35:12.200]   We're nothing.
[00:35:12.200 --> 00:35:13.200]   God is what?
[00:35:13.200 --> 00:35:14.200]   Everything.
[00:35:14.200 --> 00:35:18.680]   I think that's so key in this passage.
[00:35:18.680 --> 00:35:23.360]   So the takeaway point really, again, is verse 7.
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:28.160]   And in defining it, he says that they're truly nothing.
[00:35:28.160 --> 00:35:29.880]   Only people who've been given an opportunity.
[00:35:29.880 --> 00:35:32.360]   I want to highlight something for you, which is really interesting.
[00:35:32.360 --> 00:35:38.640]   Is when he defines him and his fellow teachers as servants, it is a different term that you
[00:35:38.640 --> 00:35:41.840]   see perhaps for deacons and for slaves.
[00:35:41.840 --> 00:35:45.780]   And you know how college has a doulos team, which is basically the literal translation
[00:35:45.780 --> 00:35:48.700]   is servant team.
[00:35:48.700 --> 00:35:50.160]   It's a different term here.
[00:35:50.160 --> 00:35:51.720]   You know what the term is?
[00:35:51.720 --> 00:35:55.400]   The term is diakonai.
[00:35:55.400 --> 00:36:00.140]   And the term means literally server boy.
[00:36:00.140 --> 00:36:05.860]   If you were in a house and you had a boy who served you food, that would be his title.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.360]   If you had a restaurant and there was a guy bossing the dishes and cleaning the tables
[00:36:09.360 --> 00:36:14.640]   and washing it in the back, his title would be diakonai.
[00:36:14.640 --> 00:36:15.640]   Diakoni.
[00:36:15.640 --> 00:36:20.440]   And literally it's just a person who's serving the thing.
[00:36:20.440 --> 00:36:25.500]   And I think this is getting at now, for me, the question of how does all this teaching
[00:36:25.500 --> 00:36:32.920]   about Apostle Paul and Paulus and being servants, how does it connect with before?
[00:36:32.920 --> 00:36:36.480]   Here are these people struggling with pride and jealousy.
[00:36:36.480 --> 00:36:39.720]   Struggling to make more of themselves, to have more for themselves.
[00:36:39.720 --> 00:36:40.720]   Right?
[00:36:40.720 --> 00:36:44.280]   And he says, "All we are are servant boys.
[00:36:44.280 --> 00:36:48.320]   Do you go to a restaurant and be like, 'Hey, we want to name this restaurant after you.'
[00:36:48.320 --> 00:36:54.440]   Like if Mark Lim was the servant and then John Kim was the master chef, you don't name
[00:36:54.440 --> 00:36:58.200]   the restaurant Mark Cafe.
[00:36:58.200 --> 00:36:59.460]   You don't.
[00:36:59.460 --> 00:37:00.900]   Who do you name it after?
[00:37:00.900 --> 00:37:03.420]   The master chef, who typically is the what?
[00:37:03.420 --> 00:37:04.860]   The owner of the restaurant.
[00:37:04.860 --> 00:37:06.180]   You don't make a big hoopla.
[00:37:06.180 --> 00:37:07.380]   You don't put him on the menu.
[00:37:07.380 --> 00:37:08.380]   You don't highlight him.
[00:37:08.380 --> 00:37:13.880]   The restaurant, the foodies and stuff, they don't go over and shake the hand of the servant
[00:37:13.880 --> 00:37:14.880]   boy.
[00:37:14.880 --> 00:37:16.840]   It was so nice to be served by you.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:21.120]   No, they say to the master chef, it was so nice to come into your restaurant and eat
[00:37:21.120 --> 00:37:23.260]   your food."
[00:37:23.260 --> 00:37:28.040]   And so Apostle Paul is giving them a perspective that's truly humble.
[00:37:28.040 --> 00:37:32.840]   As opposed to the way that they were thinking, Apostle Paul is giving them what was truly
[00:37:32.840 --> 00:37:35.680]   a humble perspective.
[00:37:35.680 --> 00:37:39.600]   And so a couple of the things that are humble perspective.
[00:37:39.600 --> 00:37:45.640]   Apostle Paul's humble perspective about his work.
[00:37:45.640 --> 00:37:47.560]   I think men struggle with it.
[00:37:47.560 --> 00:37:50.400]   Everybody struggles with it.
[00:37:50.400 --> 00:37:56.120]   You know guys who do something and they're so like mega, mega, mega insecure whether it'll
[00:37:56.120 --> 00:37:58.400]   be received well.
[00:37:58.400 --> 00:38:04.460]   Typically that's just, again, the way the view their work is they weight it very heavily
[00:38:04.460 --> 00:38:07.260]   as it defines them and men struggle with it a lot.
[00:38:07.260 --> 00:38:13.120]   Their work is a measure of their accomplishment, success and therefore everything about them.
[00:38:13.120 --> 00:38:18.160]   Well Apostle Paul has a very humble perspective about his work.
[00:38:18.160 --> 00:38:24.400]   When he talks about his planting and his watering, I mean humanistically speaking, is that all
[00:38:24.400 --> 00:38:27.520]   Paul did?
[00:38:27.520 --> 00:38:29.120]   He makes it seem so minimal.
[00:38:29.120 --> 00:38:34.520]   I just went over there, planted a seed and just packed the soil.
[00:38:34.520 --> 00:38:36.520]   Is that what Apostle Paul did?
[00:38:36.520 --> 00:38:40.200]   No, he sacrificed everything.
[00:38:40.200 --> 00:38:43.320]   He sacrificed all his possessions, his health.
[00:38:43.320 --> 00:38:44.680]   He stuck with people.
[00:38:44.680 --> 00:38:45.720]   He was imprisoned.
[00:38:45.720 --> 00:38:49.880]   He was chastised and persecuted and cast out from his society.
[00:38:49.880 --> 00:38:52.280]   He was treated like all this kind of stuff.
[00:38:52.280 --> 00:38:54.840]   To say like all I did was plant the thing.
[00:38:54.840 --> 00:39:00.760]   Doesn't that seem like a really, really understatement of what he has done?
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:05.280]   But Apostle Paul's perspective is very humble, is it not?
[00:39:05.280 --> 00:39:14.440]   What's more, I want to ask you this question.
[00:39:14.440 --> 00:39:16.360]   That doesn't fit necessarily really well.
[00:39:16.360 --> 00:39:23.880]   What's more though, really is the way that he thinks about his work.
[00:39:23.880 --> 00:39:30.440]   We typically think about our work as our work is our contribution.
[00:39:30.440 --> 00:39:32.440]   It's our value.
[00:39:32.440 --> 00:39:38.200]   So if I give you 10 hours, I better get paid for 10 hours.
[00:39:38.200 --> 00:39:39.200]   Aren't we like that a little bit?
[00:39:39.200 --> 00:39:43.360]   I don't know how many people are willing to go into their office and be like, "You can
[00:39:43.360 --> 00:39:44.360]   pay me for 10.
[00:39:44.360 --> 00:39:45.360]   I'll give you 20 hours."
[00:39:45.360 --> 00:39:47.160]   You know what I mean?
[00:39:47.160 --> 00:39:48.600]   Nobody does that.
[00:39:48.600 --> 00:39:49.600]   Nobody does that.
[00:39:49.600 --> 00:39:53.000]   As a matter of fact, if they don't pay you for that extra hour you stay in the day, you're
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:56.400]   going to be like, "Time to look for another job."
[00:39:56.400 --> 00:39:58.400]   That's the way we would think.
[00:39:58.400 --> 00:40:03.960]   But Apostle Paul, when he thinks about his work, he's not demanding to get paid then
[00:40:03.960 --> 00:40:04.960]   and there.
[00:40:04.960 --> 00:40:07.080]   He's not demanding to get paid on earth.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:11.240]   He's looking for God's simple approval.
[00:40:11.240 --> 00:40:12.840]   He's looking not for men's approval.
[00:40:12.840 --> 00:40:15.320]   He's not looking for compensation, kickback.
[00:40:15.320 --> 00:40:19.760]   And as a matter of fact, Apostle Paul says to many, many churches, "I could have asked
[00:40:19.760 --> 00:40:20.880]   you to contribute to me.
[00:40:20.880 --> 00:40:22.280]   I could have asked you for a wage.
[00:40:22.280 --> 00:40:25.880]   But I did none of that."
[00:40:25.880 --> 00:40:30.440]   To me, it's not just a simple like, "Oh, of course, planting pasture has to be like that."
[00:40:30.440 --> 00:40:32.400]   I don't think so.
[00:40:32.400 --> 00:40:39.280]   I think it indicated his humility and perspective towards his own work.
[00:40:39.280 --> 00:40:50.960]   Next, when you think about this next phrase in verse 9, "For we are God's fellow workers.
[00:40:50.960 --> 00:40:53.360]   You are God's field, God's building."
[00:40:53.360 --> 00:40:55.920]   Okay?
[00:40:55.920 --> 00:41:01.040]   Or, let me give you this one.
[00:41:01.040 --> 00:41:06.520]   The next blank I have is Apostle Paul's humble perspective about his success.
[00:41:06.520 --> 00:41:10.400]   About his success.
[00:41:10.400 --> 00:41:16.720]   Earlier someone mentioned that Apostle Paul views himself in the same light as his fellow
[00:41:16.720 --> 00:41:18.000]   teachers, right?
[00:41:18.000 --> 00:41:23.160]   Well, for me, when I read verse 8, it says, "Now he who plants and he who waters are one."
[00:41:23.160 --> 00:41:24.160]   Okay?
[00:41:24.160 --> 00:41:28.720]   Commentators have so many different views about this.
[00:41:28.720 --> 00:41:29.840]   And I was like, "Really?
[00:41:29.840 --> 00:41:30.840]   About that one statement?"
[00:41:30.840 --> 00:41:32.920]   And I do realize it's kind of nebulous.
[00:41:32.920 --> 00:41:34.480]   How are they one?
[00:41:34.480 --> 00:41:36.560]   Are they one in equal value?
[00:41:36.560 --> 00:41:38.080]   Are they one in purpose?
[00:41:38.080 --> 00:41:44.040]   Are they one simply because by nature of being part of one team, Jesus' team, being all a
[00:41:44.040 --> 00:41:50.280]   part of Jesus' master, boss, and then his workers' team?
[00:41:50.280 --> 00:41:52.120]   Is that how it's going to be?
[00:41:52.120 --> 00:41:55.960]   But for me, what's really interesting is I thought about this passage as thinking about
[00:41:55.960 --> 00:42:00.280]   his humble perspective about his success.
[00:42:00.280 --> 00:42:02.600]   Right?
[00:42:02.600 --> 00:42:10.200]   Because for him, he completely recognizes that each individual is only contributing
[00:42:10.200 --> 00:42:13.280]   to the greater goal under Christ.
[00:42:13.280 --> 00:42:18.080]   And so in so doing, the results, how it plays out, what they're contributing to, the success
[00:42:18.080 --> 00:42:22.080]   that they have, they all share in the exact same way.
[00:42:22.080 --> 00:42:23.080]   Okay?
[00:42:23.080 --> 00:42:25.240]   But now, I want to get to the main point.
[00:42:25.240 --> 00:42:29.160]   I'm going to get to the main point here.
[00:42:29.160 --> 00:42:33.680]   When I just read a moment ago verse 9, "For we are God's fellow workers, you are God's
[00:42:33.680 --> 00:42:39.960]   field, you are God's building," you realize now all of a sudden, there's like metaphors
[00:42:39.960 --> 00:42:41.680]   galore.
[00:42:41.680 --> 00:42:45.680]   So he started describing the whole gardening scene, he started describing the field scene,
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:51.080]   he started describing that, and then he says also building, like construction scene.
[00:42:51.080 --> 00:42:53.280]   I want to ask you this question.
[00:42:53.280 --> 00:42:59.920]   What do these metaphors really highlight?
[00:42:59.920 --> 00:43:18.640]   What are these metaphors meant to place in view for us?
[00:43:18.640 --> 00:43:48.600]   How about this table to my right?
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.360]   With Michelle, Jenny, and Jenny.
[00:43:54.360 --> 00:43:55.960]   Just take a stab.
[00:43:55.960 --> 00:43:59.440]   Be confident.
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:03.680]   What truth are these metaphors all trying to highlight?
[00:44:03.680 --> 00:44:05.800]   Nice.
[00:44:05.800 --> 00:44:14.760]   So she said God is the one who grows a church, God is the one who basically gives a church
[00:44:14.760 --> 00:44:15.760]   its success, right?
[00:44:15.760 --> 00:44:19.040]   God is the one who gives a church its growth.
[00:44:19.040 --> 00:44:21.160]   Absolutely.
[00:44:21.160 --> 00:44:22.720]   God is the focal point.
[00:44:22.720 --> 00:44:27.920]   And not only just generally about God, but the fact that God, in verse 9, what do you
[00:44:27.920 --> 00:44:32.160]   see as the three repetition?
[00:44:32.160 --> 00:44:36.880]   We're God's fellow workers, we're God's field, God's building.
[00:44:36.880 --> 00:44:46.720]   What do you notice?
[00:44:46.720 --> 00:44:52.880]   I heard a mumble so I'm looking over there, but I don't know who mumbled it.
[00:44:52.880 --> 00:44:54.040]   Absolutely.
[00:44:54.040 --> 00:44:56.960]   We belong to God.
[00:44:56.960 --> 00:44:58.040]   Okay?
[00:44:58.040 --> 00:45:00.600]   We belong to God.
[00:45:00.600 --> 00:45:11.200]   And so for that little Apostle Paul's humble perspective about God, there is a humble perspective
[00:45:11.200 --> 00:45:15.560]   you have, and in my mind, the most humble perspective is the perspective that's true
[00:45:15.560 --> 00:45:16.560]   to reality.
[00:45:16.560 --> 00:45:20.880]   The reality is we own nothing.
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:23.920]   What do you have that you do not receive from the Lord?
[00:45:23.920 --> 00:45:24.920]   What did you work for?
[00:45:24.920 --> 00:45:28.160]   What did you do with your hands that you create?
[00:45:28.160 --> 00:45:30.280]   Nothing.
[00:45:30.280 --> 00:45:35.280]   But I am God's, the field is God's, the building is God's, all of this is God's.
[00:45:35.280 --> 00:45:39.520]   If you're sitting here and trying to give credit, and by giving credit to a man, you
[00:45:39.520 --> 00:45:45.000]   also get to enjoy that credit, you just have reality all wrong.
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:47.840]   I think that's the point.
[00:45:47.840 --> 00:45:54.840]   If by elevating this man, if by joining that clan, you hope to somehow share in that glory
[00:45:54.840 --> 00:46:00.200]   of what they've built, what they've done, who they've taught, you've got reality all
[00:46:00.200 --> 00:46:01.200]   wrong.
[00:46:01.200 --> 00:46:07.520]   According to the Apostle Paul, all glory belongs to God because everything is his.
[00:46:07.520 --> 00:46:16.200]   So I think this is a good tie into what he's been teaching ever since chapter one.
[00:46:16.200 --> 00:46:17.200]   Right?
[00:46:17.200 --> 00:46:24.720]   By way of review, by way of review, in verse one through four, he was again battling and
[00:46:24.720 --> 00:46:30.640]   reiterating the idea that the men are struggling with the sin of division, both because of
[00:46:30.640 --> 00:46:36.440]   the external pressures of worldly wisdom and their internal flesh.
[00:46:36.440 --> 00:46:38.200]   Right?
[00:46:38.200 --> 00:46:40.560]   And so how does he combat that?
[00:46:40.560 --> 00:46:45.720]   The basic point in verses five through nine is, we are nothing, God is boss.
[00:46:45.720 --> 00:46:46.720]   Yeah?
[00:46:46.720 --> 00:46:53.160]   If you find jealousy in your heart, the sense in which you have to remind yourself, who
[00:46:53.160 --> 00:46:58.080]   am I that I think I deserve what that guy has?
[00:46:58.080 --> 00:47:00.840]   That's a good question, you know?
[00:47:00.840 --> 00:47:06.600]   Who do I think I am that I can demand of God and be unhappy that he didn't give me?
[00:47:06.600 --> 00:47:10.360]   When you find a jealous heart, we have to remember this truth.
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.280]   We are nothing, God is boss.
[00:47:13.280 --> 00:47:18.000]   I want to conclude by a little encouragement here.
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:28.600]   I do like the fact, and I'm encouraged by the fact, that in verse one of chapter three,
[00:47:28.600 --> 00:47:34.240]   he does say, "And I, brethren, could not speak to you as spiritual men, but as to men of
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:37.600]   the flesh, as to infants in Christ."
[00:47:37.600 --> 00:47:44.120]   The reason why I'm encouraged by that verse is because, although Apostle Paul could not
[00:47:44.120 --> 00:47:52.000]   speak to the men like mature adults, it seems that Apostle Paul spoke as a mature adult.
[00:47:52.000 --> 00:47:56.560]   Because he didn't speak as Lord over them, he spoke as a brother.
[00:47:56.560 --> 00:47:58.400]   He calls them brethren.
[00:47:58.400 --> 00:48:04.440]   And he recognizes that they are in Christ, but nonetheless, they're acting and behaving
[00:48:04.440 --> 00:48:05.920]   fleshly.
[00:48:05.920 --> 00:48:07.320]   Okay?
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:13.400]   In my mind, I'm encouraged by that because I'm reminded we are a work in progress.
[00:48:13.400 --> 00:48:17.840]   I'm reminded that God is changing us, but that change is going to take time.
[00:48:17.840 --> 00:48:23.440]   It's going to take constant reflection, village and prayer, and all of that, sobriety, and
[00:48:23.440 --> 00:48:26.040]   going to the Word.
[00:48:26.040 --> 00:48:32.600]   But Apostle Paul, again, in the way that he rebukes them, he has this interesting balance.
[00:48:32.600 --> 00:48:35.080]   Can he legitimately be frustrated with the people?
[00:48:35.080 --> 00:48:36.080]   Yeah.
[00:48:36.080 --> 00:48:40.720]   You know, he invested so much into them, but nonetheless, he doesn't come off like, "And
[00:48:40.720 --> 00:48:42.240]   therefore, be gone with you.
[00:48:42.240 --> 00:48:45.200]   I don't want to deal with you people anymore."
[00:48:45.200 --> 00:48:49.400]   He calls them brethren, he appeals to them, and he encourages them.
[00:48:49.400 --> 00:48:50.400]   You need to grow.
[00:48:50.400 --> 00:48:51.400]   Okay?
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:54.160]   So, I hope we're encouraged to do the same.
[00:48:54.160 --> 00:48:58.160]   You guys can jump into your small groups for discussion.
[00:48:58.160 --> 00:49:02.680]   You know, typical questions, were there anything that stood out to you?
[00:49:02.680 --> 00:49:07.960]   I have an interesting question here, letter D. How can you strive to have a legitimately
[00:49:07.960 --> 00:49:16.880]   strong and consistently mature practice of faith without being all arrogant about it?
[00:49:16.880 --> 00:49:18.880]   And I find that some people have a hard time with that.
[00:49:18.880 --> 00:49:23.260]   It's kind of like, they have a hard time, let's say, rebuking or correcting somebody
[00:49:23.260 --> 00:49:27.800]   the way Apostle Paul would, because they're always kind of on the lines of saying, "I
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:33.200]   know too, and we all struggle," and they almost always have to preface with like, "I'm the
[00:49:33.200 --> 00:49:34.720]   same boat you are.
[00:49:34.720 --> 00:49:38.200]   You know, we're just brothers, both like at the bottom of the wall, and we're climbing
[00:49:38.200 --> 00:49:39.200]   together."
[00:49:39.200 --> 00:49:40.200]   You know?
[00:49:40.200 --> 00:49:42.320]   But I don't necessarily think that has to be true either.
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.760]   There are people who are legitimately stronger in the faith than others, and there are people
[00:49:46.760 --> 00:49:54.440]   who legitimately have practiced righteousness, and so they have a practical, just, you know,
[00:49:54.440 --> 00:49:58.120]   greater application of living out of the faith.
[00:49:58.120 --> 00:50:01.280]   But how do you do that without getting all prideful?
[00:50:01.280 --> 00:50:06.840]   The other question that's not on here that you guys can talk about is, you know, in line
[00:50:06.840 --> 00:50:12.200]   with this, there's this concept of, if someone were to ask you, "So these people are described
[00:50:12.200 --> 00:50:16.400]   as carnal, like fleshly, but you're saying that they're still Christian.
[00:50:16.400 --> 00:50:19.400]   How can that be?"
[00:50:19.400 --> 00:50:25.080]   We know that, okay, that kind of anomaly and paradox exists in the Christian life.
[00:50:25.080 --> 00:50:28.480]   You're still in the flesh, but your spirit is new, and the Holy Spirit is in you, but
[00:50:28.480 --> 00:50:33.960]   you're still flesh, so it's like, you know, joining of the holy and the flesh and whatnot.
[00:50:33.960 --> 00:50:36.280]   How would you explain that to somebody?
[00:50:36.280 --> 00:50:38.320]   How would you explain the existence?
[00:50:38.320 --> 00:50:41.520]   And I know at our church, Pastor Peter, I've said so many times, like, "Yes, some people
[00:50:41.520 --> 00:50:45.080]   say there's nominal Christians, and there's plateauing Christians, and there's carnal
[00:50:45.080 --> 00:50:46.080]   Christians."
[00:50:46.280 --> 00:50:50.000]   You know, he's preached many times before, like, "That doesn't exist!
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:53.040]   You can't be carnal for all your life and then still call yourself Christian.
[00:50:53.040 --> 00:50:55.760]   How do you reconcile those thoughts is basically what I'm saying."
[00:50:55.760 --> 00:50:56.840]   You know what I mean?
[00:50:56.840 --> 00:50:59.080]   So, okay?
[00:50:59.080 --> 00:51:02.960]   Any questions about today's passage?
[00:51:02.960 --> 00:51:07.160]   About the summary is, "You are nothing, God is boss."
[00:51:07.160 --> 00:51:12.200]   Alright, let's pray, and then you guys can jump into your small group discussions.
