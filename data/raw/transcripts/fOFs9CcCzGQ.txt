[00:14:52.000 --> 00:15:04.000]   All right, good morning church family.
[00:15:04.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   It's been a busy week in the Lord.
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:09.000]   We're going to go ahead and get started with our service this morning.
[00:15:09.000 --> 00:15:16.000]   As we get started, let's just take a moment to pray,
[00:15:16.000 --> 00:15:18.000]   to prepare our hearts for worship.
[00:15:18.000 --> 00:15:22.000]   Ask the Spirit to guide us,
[00:15:22.000 --> 00:15:25.000]   to fix our gaze and our attention on Christ.
[00:15:25.000 --> 00:15:28.000]   That even in the midst of distractions,
[00:15:28.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   in the midst of the worries and the cares of this world,
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:34.000]   whatever it is that you are going through,
[00:15:34.000 --> 00:15:39.000]   that we would still be able to come and to give God the worship that He truly deserves.
[00:15:39.000 --> 00:15:41.000]   So let's take a moment to do that.

[00:19:45.000 --> 00:19:57.000]   Hello, good morning.
[00:19:57.000 --> 00:20:00.000]   If you're brand new to Berean Community Church,
[00:20:00.000 --> 00:20:02.000]   we want to extend a warm, warm welcome to you.
[00:20:02.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   When the service is done, please do visit our welcome booth.
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   As you enter, you saw the blue canopy and our team members there.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   Please swing by, we'd love to get to know you.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And if you have any questions about the church,
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:17.000]   we'd gladly answer the questions there.
[00:20:17.000 --> 00:20:20.000]   For a couple announcements, for those of you who are newer,
[00:20:20.000 --> 00:20:25.000]   we do have a membership class that's going to be taking place starting next Sunday.
[00:20:25.000 --> 00:20:29.000]   And that is a class that takes place from 9 a.m.
[00:20:29.000 --> 00:20:33.000]   And it goes over the fundamental doctrines of the Christian faith,
[00:20:33.000 --> 00:20:35.000]   laying the foundations for what we believe,
[00:20:35.000 --> 00:20:40.000]   but also will explain how that translates into the church life and the Christian life,
[00:20:40.000 --> 00:20:43.000]   showing forth what is the ministry philosophy
[00:20:43.000 --> 00:20:46.000]   so that you can make a decision about becoming a member.
[00:20:46.000 --> 00:20:48.000]   So please sign up for that.
[00:20:48.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   It's going to be on both the website,
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   and you can even visit our welcome booth to register for that.
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   For the members of the church,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   there is going to be a members' meeting on Sunday the 23rd.
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:02.000]   Please mark your calendar.
[00:21:02.000 --> 00:21:04.000]   And if you know that you're going to be absent,
[00:21:04.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   we sent an email where you can just quickly fill out a form letting us know.
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   And then that way you can also update any information, etc., etc.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:17.000]   The last announcement is going to be about our inductive Bible study.
[00:21:17.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   The next session of the Bible study will begin August 31st, so end of August.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   And this sign-up is for those of you who will be participating in our main Wednesday study here at church,
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   or anybody new who wants to--
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   again, the small--sorry, the home groups are reserved for those in process of being a member or a member.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:42.000]   But if you're new and wanted to jump into that,
[00:21:42.000 --> 00:21:45.000]   either transitioning from the Wednesday group to a home group,
[00:21:45.000 --> 00:21:47.000]   you use that form to sign up,
[00:21:47.000 --> 00:21:50.000]   meaning anybody who's already involved in a home group.
[00:21:50.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   This sign-up is not for you because you will just confirm with your home group leader,
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:21:59.000]   and that way we'll just renew the roster and you'll be set up for that, okay?
[00:21:59.000 --> 00:22:02.000]   So again, please do sign up for the Bible study.
[00:22:02.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   We hope to make the groups early on and get that squared away.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:08.000]   So we will enter into time of offering.
[00:22:08.000 --> 00:22:12.000]   And as a reminder, for those of you who has a physical check,
[00:22:12.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   there is an offering box right by the entry.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:17.000]   Otherwise, we can give our offering through the digital form.
[00:22:17.000 --> 00:22:22.000]   Let's pray.
[00:22:22.000 --> 00:22:26.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you, God, for your grace and your mercies.
[00:22:26.000 --> 00:22:30.000]   We thank you, Lord, for your abounding love.
[00:22:30.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   And God, it's a unique privilege for us to be able to gather,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:38.000]   to join so that we can unite our hearts and our voices to worship you.
[00:22:38.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   And collectively, God, we are so thankful for the salvation you give to us.
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:48.000]   And God, through your son, Jesus Christ, you make all these things possible.
[00:22:48.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   We do pray, Lord, that our hearts of faith would ever grow in appreciation for you
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:57.000]   and your very presence in our lives.
[00:22:57.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   And God, as we gather, the content of our faith, the meditation of our heart,
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:03.000]   may it be pleasing unto you.
[00:23:03.000 --> 00:23:05.000]   And likewise, we pray for the offering,
[00:23:05.000 --> 00:23:09.000]   that that too would be something honoring and pleasing in your sight,
[00:23:09.000 --> 00:23:15.000]   as we desire, Lord, to render to you our works of service, our hearts, and more.
[00:23:15.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   And we pray that the offering will be used, God, for the furthering of your gospel,
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:21.000]   the furthering of your kingdom.
[00:23:21.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   We thank you, Lord, it is in Christ's name. Amen.

[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:18.000]   All right, let us all stand together as we continue our worship.
[00:24:18.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   [music]
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:34.000]   In the name of the Father,
[00:24:34.000 --> 00:24:37.000]   in the name of the Son,
[00:24:37.000 --> 00:24:40.000]   in the name of the Spirit,
[00:24:40.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   Lord, be in Christ.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:45.000]   We gather together
[00:24:45.000 --> 00:24:47.000]   to lift up your name,
[00:24:47.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   to call on your Savior,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:52.000]   to call on your grace.
[00:24:52.000 --> 00:25:00.000]   In the name of the Father,
[00:25:00.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   in the name of the Son,
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:05.000]   in the name of the Spirit,

[00:25:07.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   We gather together
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:12.000]   to lift up your name,
[00:25:12.000 --> 00:25:15.000]   to call on your Savior,
[00:25:15.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   to call on your grace.
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:22.000]   Hear the joyful sound of our offering,
[00:25:22.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   as your sins bow down,
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   as your people sing.
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   We will rise with you,
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   lifting our glory,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:36.000]   and our proudness in the air.
[00:25:36.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   Our God's name,
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   our God's name,
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:51.000]   in His blood,
[00:25:51.000 --> 00:25:56.000]   in Your name.
[00:25:56.000 --> 00:25:59.000]   In the name of the Father,
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   in the name of the Son,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:05.000]   in the name of the Spirit,
[00:26:05.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   Lord, be in Christ.
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:09.000]   We gather together
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   to lift up your name,
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   to call on your Savior,
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   to call on your grace.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   Hear the joyful sound of our offering,
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   as your sins bow down,

[00:26:27.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   We will rise with you,
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:32.000]   lifting our glory,
[00:26:32.000 --> 00:26:36.000]   and our proudness in the air.
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Our God's name,
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:46.000]   our God's name,
[00:26:46.000 --> 00:26:51.000]   in His blood,
[00:26:51.000 --> 00:26:55.000]   in Your name.
[00:26:56.000 --> 00:27:00.000]   For the time
[00:27:00.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   to come again,
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   our God's name,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:16.000]   our God's name.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:37.000]   [instrumental]
[00:27:37.000 --> 00:27:42.000]   Hear the joyful sound of our offering,
[00:27:42.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   as your sins bow down,
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   as your people sing.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:50.000]   We will rise with you,
[00:27:50.000 --> 00:27:52.000]   lifted on your wings,
[00:27:52.000 --> 00:27:56.000]   and the world will see that.
[00:27:56.000 --> 00:28:01.000]   Yes, the world will see that.
[00:28:01.000 --> 00:28:06.000]   Our God's name,
[00:28:06.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   our God's name,
[00:28:12.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   in His blood,
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:21.000]   in Your name.
[00:28:21.000 --> 00:28:26.000]   For the time
[00:28:26.000 --> 00:28:31.000]   to come again,
[00:28:31.000 --> 00:28:36.000]   our God's name,
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:45.000]   our God's name.
[00:28:45.000 --> 00:28:47.000]   Amen.
[00:28:47.000 --> 00:29:00.000]   [instrumental]
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   Oh, I love the voice of Jesus
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:08.000]   on the cross of Calvary.
[00:29:08.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   He declares His work is finished.
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:17.000]   He has spoken this all to me.
[00:29:17.000 --> 00:29:22.000]   Though the sun had ceased its shining,
[00:29:22.000 --> 00:29:27.000]   though the war appeared as lost,
[00:29:27.000 --> 00:29:31.000]   Christ, a triumphant believer,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:37.000]   here was finished upon that cross.
[00:29:37.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   [instrumental]
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:58.000]   Though the cursive has been broken,
[00:29:58.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   Jesus paid the price for me.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:07.000]   All the pardon He has ever given,
[00:30:07.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   the welcome that I've received.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   Hopefully I approach my final,
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   called in Jesus' righteousness.
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:26.000]   There is no one guilty here.
[00:30:26.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Here was finished upon that cross.
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   [instrumental]
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   Death was once my great opponent.
[00:30:53.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   But the Son who died to save us
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   rose that we would be free indeed.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   [instrumental]
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:19.000]   Death was once my great opponent.
[00:31:19.000 --> 00:31:23.000]   Fear once had a hold on me.
[00:31:23.000 --> 00:31:28.000]   But the Son who died to save us
[00:31:28.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   rose that we would be free indeed.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   Yes, He rose that we would be free indeed.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   Free from every plan of darkness,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:46.000]   free to live and free to love.
[00:31:47.000 --> 00:31:51.000]   Death is dead in Christ's name.
[00:31:51.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   Here was finished upon that cross.
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   Onward to eternal glory,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:05.000]   to my Savior and my God.
[00:32:05.000 --> 00:32:10.000]   I rejoice in Jesus' name.
[00:32:10.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   Here was finished upon that cross.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:19.000]   Here was finished upon that cross.
[00:32:19.000 --> 00:32:24.000]   Here was finished upon that cross.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:34.000]   [instrumental]
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:36.000]   Amen. You may be seated.
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:44.000]   Okay, amen.
[00:32:44.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   Please turn your Bible over to Romans chapter 9.
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   Take a moment to read a verse from verse 22
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:32:57.000]   down to verse 24.
[00:32:57.000 --> 00:33:03.000]   Romans chapter 9.
[00:33:03.000 --> 00:33:08.000]   In this passage it says, "What if God,
[00:33:08.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   although willing to demonstrate His wrath
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   and to make His power known,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:16.000]   endured with much patience vessels of wrath
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   prepared for destruction,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and He did so to make known the riches of His glory
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:24.000]   upon the vessels of mercy
[00:33:24.000 --> 00:33:27.000]   which He prepared beforehand for glory,
[00:33:27.000 --> 00:33:29.000]   even us whom He also called,
[00:33:29.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   not from among Jews only,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:33.000]   but also from among the Gentiles."
[00:33:33.000 --> 00:33:35.000]   Let's bow our heads in prayer.
[00:33:35.000 --> 00:33:38.000]   Our Heavenly Father, we thank You, God,
[00:33:38.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   for Your loving kindness,
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:43.000]   which also includes, Lord,
[00:33:43.000 --> 00:33:46.000]   Your holy revelation given to us,
[00:33:46.000 --> 00:33:48.000]   that God, in Your grace,
[00:33:48.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   You would show to us the things
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:53.000]   that are truly unattainable by man,
[00:33:53.000 --> 00:33:56.000]   the things we cannot perceive with our human eyes,
[00:33:56.000 --> 00:33:58.000]   but are things that belong to You.
[00:33:58.000 --> 00:34:01.000]   We thank You, God, for this text in Romans 9.
[00:34:01.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   We pray You grant to us conviction of faith.
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   We pray You grant to us receptive hearts
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:09.000]   and spirits moved,
[00:34:09.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   God, that we would be so warmed,
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:14.000]   so amazed by the salvation You give.
[00:34:14.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   We thank You in Christ's name. Amen.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:21.000]   I apologize. As you can tell,
[00:34:21.000 --> 00:34:24.000]   my voice is already kind of going away.
[00:34:24.000 --> 00:34:27.000]   You'll have to excuse me.
[00:34:27.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   I end up taking a good amount of chugs of water.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:32.000]   I got sick at the beginning of the week.
[00:34:32.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And so I'm recovering.
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:37.000]   So after the service, if I don't give my normal hugs
[00:34:37.000 --> 00:34:41.000]   or handshakes, please know it's because I'm ceremonially unclean.
[00:34:41.000 --> 00:34:44.000]   But I will give you the head nod,
[00:34:44.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   and you know I love you, okay?
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   We're in Romans 9 because I had the privilege
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   of joining our youth group Sunday services,
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:57.000]   and they were studying through the book of Romans.
[00:34:57.000 --> 00:34:59.000]   And when I walked in, I got to preach
[00:34:59.000 --> 00:35:02.000]   from the end of Romans 8, as you guys know.
[00:35:02.000 --> 00:35:05.000]   It's a beautiful passage on the securities of salvation.
[00:35:05.000 --> 00:35:08.000]   If God is for us, who can be against us, right?
[00:35:08.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   And then I preached through Romans 9,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   which is an incredibly difficult passage
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   to preach through for youth group students
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   because there's a lot of questions.
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   Wait a minute. Is God's Word, like, failing?
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:22.000]   Is He just, you know?
[00:35:22.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And simply state, obviously, God's Word is so powerful.
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   God is 100% just,
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   and the topic at hand is
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   God predestines to save.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:36.000]   So that reminded me about my salvation
[00:35:36.000 --> 00:35:38.000]   and youth group era.
[00:35:38.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   I got saved at a, you know, later in high school.
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   I think it was my junior or senior year.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:44.000]   I thanked the Lord I was saved
[00:35:44.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   at a really sweet United Methodist church
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:48.000]   down in San Diego.
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   And if you guys know a little bit
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:52.000]   about the United Methodist church,
[00:35:52.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   they have a Wesleyan background,
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:56.000]   which they deny predestination,
[00:35:56.000 --> 00:35:58.000]   as Calvin would put it,
[00:35:58.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   because there is a, you can say, tension
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:04.000]   between is it all God,
[00:36:04.000 --> 00:36:08.000]   where He chooses and predetermines everything?
[00:36:08.000 --> 00:36:10.000]   Or is there an element in which we retain
[00:36:10.000 --> 00:36:12.000]   our agency, our free will,
[00:36:12.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   and God graciously gives that to us?
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:17.000]   Okay. Interestingly enough,
[00:36:17.000 --> 00:36:18.000]   in a youth group discussion,
[00:36:18.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   one of the young girls in youth group asked me,
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   "Hey, Mark, do you believe in election?"
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   And so I started looking around to see
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:27.000]   what should I say, because I was a baby believer,
[00:36:27.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   you know?
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:30.000]   But in my head, I was like,
[00:36:30.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   "Well, if we're talking about
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   does God sovereignly choose,
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:36.000]   I just assumed, 'Oh, yeah, 100 percent.
[00:36:36.000 --> 00:36:38.000]   I believe,' you know?"
[00:36:38.000 --> 00:36:41.000]   And she gave me this like, "But why?"
[00:36:41.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   And I realized, number one,
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:46.000]   "Oh, man, I guess I answered that wrong."
[00:36:46.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   And then number two,
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   I obviously as a young believer,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:50.000]   I didn't know.
[00:36:50.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   All I could say was,
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:56.000]   "Ah, I guess you kind of have your choice,
[00:36:56.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   but do we really?"
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:36:58.000]   You know?
[00:36:58.000 --> 00:36:59.000]   And then two,
[00:36:59.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   "Because it just makes sense that if God's God,
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:04.000]   then He's sovereign."
[00:37:04.000 --> 00:37:05.000]   Right?
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:07.000]   And I didn't know what else to say about that.
[00:37:07.000 --> 00:37:09.000]   Well, as you guys know,
[00:37:09.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   part of the reason why
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:11.000]   the doctrine of election
[00:37:11.000 --> 00:37:13.000]   is difficult for a lot of people is
[00:37:13.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   the doctrine of election,
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:17.000]   does God predestine,
[00:37:17.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   simply says it is 100 percent God's choice to save.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And this specifically, apart from you.
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   There is no consideration of what you would do.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   There is no consideration about your own capacity
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   to choose right from wrong.
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And no, there is no consideration
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   even of the faith that you will be
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:40.000]   preveniently, or I guess graciously,
[00:37:40.000 --> 00:37:43.000]   allowed to exercise.
[00:37:43.000 --> 00:37:44.000]   Let me repeat that.
[00:37:44.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   The doctrine of election is in some sense
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   very, very simple
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   because what it says is
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   God is 100 percent sovereign
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:54.000]   to choose whom He will save.
[00:37:54.000 --> 00:37:58.000]   And that is specifically, apart from you.
[00:37:58.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   There are those who have very, very,
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.000]   I guess, difficult time accepting that
[00:38:03.000 --> 00:38:07.000]   because yes, although the verbiage sounds right,
[00:38:07.000 --> 00:38:09.000]   that doesn't make sense
[00:38:09.000 --> 00:38:13.000]   because in our day, we have to surrender.
[00:38:13.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   I have to come to the altar.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   I have to repent.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:19.000]   And what's more, Scripture does say,
[00:38:19.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   John chapter 1, verse 12,
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:23.000]   "To all who receive Him,
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   to those who believe on His name,
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   He gave the right to become children of God."
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:31.000]   But here's another reason why sometimes
[00:38:31.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   the problem of election
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:35.000]   is difficult to accept or swallow
[00:38:35.000 --> 00:38:38.000]   is because if we imagine it,
[00:38:38.000 --> 00:38:42.000]   election seems so cold.
[00:38:42.000 --> 00:38:45.000]   It seems too mechanical.
[00:38:45.000 --> 00:38:47.000]   We could only imagine
[00:38:47.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   some arbitrary fashion
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:51.000]   in which God looks at
[00:38:51.000 --> 00:38:54.000]   a host of mankind
[00:38:54.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   and maybe blindly goes,
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   "You, you, you, you, you, you, you."
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   And that can't be because that seems unloving.
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:06.000]   And so people wonder,
[00:39:06.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   not only is it unloving,
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:11.000]   but does it even uphold our humanity?
[00:39:11.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   Does it uphold our own volition,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   our own agency?
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   And so they say,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:20.000]   "It can't be that God elects in that way."
[00:39:20.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   And so there are people who have said,
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:26.000]   "God, He has foreknowledge,
[00:39:26.000 --> 00:39:28.000]   not predestination,
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:30.000]   but just foreknowledge.
[00:39:30.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   He knows that you will exercise faith.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   And He knows who will be His,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   but He does not predetermine
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:41.000]   the fate of our lives."
[00:39:41.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   Well, the passage in Romans chapter 8 through 9,
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:49.000]   and then all of chapter 10,
[00:39:49.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   all of chapter 11,
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:53.000]   it emphatically tells us,
[00:39:53.000 --> 00:39:57.000]   "No, stop trying to rationalize election.
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   Stop trying to rationalize how God saves
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   according to what you think
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   should be, ought to be,
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   or make sense to you."
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:11.000]   God is revealing something to us
[00:40:11.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   that we cannot attain to
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:16.000]   by our human observation.
[00:40:16.000 --> 00:40:18.000]   This is something God says,
[00:40:18.000 --> 00:40:20.000]   "Here is something that's mine."
[00:40:20.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   Right? The secret thing belongs to the Lord.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   "Here is something that I did."
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:27.000]   And He graciously reveals it to us and says,
[00:40:27.000 --> 00:40:30.000]   "I choose sovereignly."
[00:40:30.000 --> 00:40:34.000]   All of salvation is so, so God's,
[00:40:34.000 --> 00:40:36.000]   it belongs to Him,
[00:40:36.000 --> 00:40:39.000]   that yes, as you, as in this specific passage,
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:43.000]   worry about even the people of Israel,
[00:40:43.000 --> 00:40:46.000]   their salvation is so secure.
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:48.000]   I guarantee it.
[00:40:48.000 --> 00:40:50.000]   It's as though it's done.
[00:40:50.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   So what I'd like to do
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:55.000]   is walk through this kind of lengthy passages
[00:40:55.000 --> 00:40:57.000]   of Romans 8 through 9
[00:40:57.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   to think about how God has revealed to us
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:03.000]   this idea of the sovereign choice of God.
[00:41:03.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   And what I want to communicate to you,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:07.000]   that the prevailing theme
[00:41:07.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   in the way that He communicated it
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:13.000]   is not, "This is a theological doctrine
[00:41:13.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   that you must sign off on."
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   The prevailing way and theme
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   that He has communicated to us
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:21.000]   is, "You don't understand
[00:41:21.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   the glory of my mercy in election."
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:27.000]   I want to show you just
[00:41:27.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   the kindness of my intention,
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   the compassion of my heart
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   goes long before you ever existed.
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:39.000]   And in that way, I want us to appreciate our salvation.
[00:41:39.000 --> 00:41:42.000]   In that way, I want us to be warmed in our heart,
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   glorify God, and just be amazed
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:48.000]   at the salvation that God has accomplished.
[00:41:48.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   Point number one, then as we look,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   point number one is just a simple statement
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   that God has given to us
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   this election that is all-inclusive,
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   and we have to appreciate this all-inclusive nature
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:06.000]   of the election that He gives.
[00:42:06.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   I wish there was a better word than "all-inclusive,"
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:11.000]   because then you start thinking, like,
[00:42:11.000 --> 00:42:14.000]   your trip to Cancun is all-inclusive, right?
[00:42:14.000 --> 00:42:16.000]   You have meals, you have entertainment,
[00:42:16.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   you have drinks, and then you also have your lodging, right?
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   But what I mean by the all-conclusive is,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:24.000]   actually, yes, you have everything.
[00:42:24.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   In election, it is an election of what?
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   And our human minds have a hard time
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:37.000]   comprehending the all-inclusive nature of it
[00:42:37.000 --> 00:42:40.000]   because we are limited.
[00:42:40.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   To us, we are limited by time.
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   To us, we are limited by sequence.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   Things to us have to be given in step one,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:49.000]   step two, step three.
[00:42:49.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   We can't guarantee step one through 100
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:54.000]   because we are limited.
[00:42:54.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And it's hard for me to imagine things out of sequence
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:42:58.000]   because we are limited.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   Remember, yesterday is like today for God.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   A thousand years is like one moment to God.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:07.000]   There is such a difference between us and God.
[00:43:07.000 --> 00:43:11.000]   His election is all-inclusive.
[00:43:11.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   What do I mean by that?
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:16.000]   Well, number one, is there a time feature to election?
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   Yes.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:20.000]   Ephesians 1, verse 3-4 tells us
[00:43:20.000 --> 00:43:23.000]   that the election is a part of the incredible blessings
[00:43:23.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   all in Christ.
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:26.000]   But take a look.
[00:43:26.000 --> 00:43:30.000]   "Blessed be the God, the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,
[00:43:30.000 --> 00:43:34.000]   who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing."
[00:43:34.000 --> 00:43:38.000]   It's an all-inclusive blessing, and no part can actually
[00:43:38.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   be separated from one another.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   We have been given all the blessings in the heavenly places
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   in Christ, just as He chose us in Him
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   When?
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:56.000]   The time feature is before He laid the foundation
[00:43:56.000 --> 00:43:59.000]   of this created universe.
[00:43:59.000 --> 00:44:01.000]   Poof! Right?
[00:44:01.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   Explain that one.
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:05.000]   We can't.
[00:44:05.000 --> 00:44:09.000]   Our limited, finite human minds cannot explain
[00:44:09.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   God choosing in Christ His Son
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   before the foundation of the world.
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:17.000]   But that is what's given to us.
[00:44:17.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   Okay?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:24.000]   And therefore, we cannot deny that election,
[00:44:24.000 --> 00:44:29.000]   predestination, is a part of the whole of salvation.
[00:44:29.000 --> 00:44:32.000]   And maybe it's better for us to stop using things
[00:44:32.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   just simply like "election," but it's a biblical term,
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:36.000]   so we keep it.
[00:44:36.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   But the idea is God chooses.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   And then He says, "That we would be holy,
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   blame this before Him."
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   Okay?
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:51.000]   Just going to keep it right there.
[00:44:51.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   But I may knock it over because--
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   Okay.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   So then, let's think about this.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:44:59.000]   What am I trying to say to you?
[00:44:59.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   I find that one of the subtle flaws of my thinking
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:09.000]   is because I try to imagine how election plays out,
[00:45:09.000 --> 00:45:12.000]   which is a dangerous thing to do as a human,
[00:45:12.000 --> 00:45:15.000]   trying to see how did God work this out.
[00:45:15.000 --> 00:45:19.000]   I find that I fall into this trap of thinking of election
[00:45:19.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   only sequentially as just the beginning portion.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:25.000]   But what's more, here is my flaw.
[00:45:25.000 --> 00:45:30.000]   I think about it as an ancient edict.
[00:45:30.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   I think about it as a decree that this sovereign creator,
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:41.000]   right, He foreordained and predestined each one of you,
[00:45:41.000 --> 00:45:45.000]   and therefore you have a specific destiny,
[00:45:45.000 --> 00:45:48.000]   an allotment in your life.
[00:45:48.000 --> 00:45:50.000]   You know what that is?
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   That's fatalism.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:54.000]   There is this ancient--as far as you can think about it,
[00:45:54.000 --> 00:45:58.000]   there is this decree, and you can do no none of that.
[00:45:58.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   You have no say.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   It doesn't even matter what you do.
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:04.000]   Why?
[00:46:04.000 --> 00:46:06.000]   Because there is an edict from long ago,
[00:46:06.000 --> 00:46:08.000]   and you're but this piece moving along.
[00:46:08.000 --> 00:46:10.000]   You know what that is?
[00:46:10.000 --> 00:46:12.000]   It's the false religion of deism.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:14.000]   If you look up deism during the time of enlightenment,
[00:46:14.000 --> 00:46:17.000]   they said there is this sovereign maker
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.000]   who, like a game master, winds up the top,
[00:46:20.000 --> 00:46:23.000]   and he spins it, and it goes.
[00:46:23.000 --> 00:46:25.000]   Right?
[00:46:25.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   But the false feature of deism
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:30.000]   is that this sovereign creator
[00:46:30.000 --> 00:46:34.000]   is actually uninvolved in your daily life.
[00:46:34.000 --> 00:46:36.000]   That's false.
[00:46:36.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   The way God describes His choice
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:44.000]   is not simply a choice to free you
[00:46:44.000 --> 00:46:46.000]   and then now go make your way.
[00:46:46.000 --> 00:46:48.000]   And even more, it's not just simply--
[00:46:48.000 --> 00:46:51.000]   it's choice to set you on a route.
[00:46:51.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   It's not just simply He elects you,
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:46:56.000]   and then now you're going to play out--
[00:46:56.000 --> 00:46:58.000]   He is the script maker.
[00:46:58.000 --> 00:47:00.000]   He is the play maker.
[00:47:00.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   And now you just play out the script as some robot.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:06.000]   See, that's the falsehood, subtle falsehood.
[00:47:06.000 --> 00:47:08.000]   It's not like that at all.
[00:47:08.000 --> 00:47:10.000]   What does He say?
[00:47:10.000 --> 00:47:13.000]   Turn your eyes to Romans 8 and reflect on this matter,
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.000]   like Apostle Paul does.
[00:47:15.000 --> 00:47:18.000]   He says in Romans 8, again,
[00:47:18.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   this passage is so beautiful.
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   It's so choc--we can camp out here forever.
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:26.000]   But he says in Romans 8,
[00:47:26.000 --> 00:47:30.000]   "We know that God causes all things
[00:47:30.000 --> 00:47:32.000]   by His sovereign choice
[00:47:32.000 --> 00:47:36.000]   to work together for the good of those who love God.
[00:47:36.000 --> 00:47:39.000]   And to those who are called by His choice,
[00:47:39.000 --> 00:47:41.000]   according to His purpose,
[00:47:41.000 --> 00:47:43.000]   for those whom He foreknew,
[00:47:43.000 --> 00:47:45.000]   He also predestined."
[00:47:45.000 --> 00:47:46.000]   It's there.
[00:47:46.000 --> 00:47:49.000]   "To become conformed to the image of His Son,
[00:47:49.000 --> 00:47:51.000]   all by His choice,
[00:47:51.000 --> 00:47:54.000]   so that He would be the firstborn among many brethren.
[00:47:54.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   And these whom He predestined,
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   He also called.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:47:59.000]   And these whom He called,
[00:47:59.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   He also justified.
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:03.000]   And these whom He justified,
[00:48:03.000 --> 00:48:05.000]   He also glorified."
[00:48:05.000 --> 00:48:09.000]   The choice was to call you,
[00:48:09.000 --> 00:48:11.000]   to love upon you that you would be a child
[00:48:11.000 --> 00:48:13.000]   and therefore called a brethren?
[00:48:13.000 --> 00:48:16.000]   I mean, talk about mind-blowing.
[00:48:16.000 --> 00:48:19.000]   To consider ourselves elevated to the stature
[00:48:19.000 --> 00:48:21.000]   of a brother of Christ?
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:22.000]   Incredible.
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   To be sanctified in Christ, His choice.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:28.000]   To then be glorified, His choice.
[00:48:28.000 --> 00:48:31.000]   And all of these things are all-inclusive,
[00:48:31.000 --> 00:48:33.000]   and we cannot separate it
[00:48:33.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   just because we don't know how to keep it all together
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:38.000]   in our minds.
[00:48:38.000 --> 00:48:40.000]   Any accusation that says,
[00:48:40.000 --> 00:48:43.000]   "You know, election just seems so arbitrary.
[00:48:43.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   It seems so fatalistic."
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:49.000]   No.
[00:48:49.000 --> 00:48:51.000]   This is the kind of choice that God gives
[00:48:51.000 --> 00:48:54.000]   in which He is choosing
[00:48:54.000 --> 00:48:58.000]   to do all and every piece of salvation
[00:48:58.000 --> 00:49:02.000]   to such a degree that Apostle Paul's complaint isn't,
[00:49:02.000 --> 00:49:04.000]   "Well, wait a minute. What about my own agency?"
[00:49:04.000 --> 00:49:06.000]   Or, "Wait a minute. What about my own input?"
[00:49:06.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Or, "Wait a minute. What about..."
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:09.000]   No, Paul's response is like this.
[00:49:09.000 --> 00:49:11.000]   We turn our eyes to verse 38,
[00:49:11.000 --> 00:49:13.000]   and what he says is,
[00:49:13.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   For Apostle Paul, thinking about election
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:39.000]   gives him incredible security,
[00:49:39.000 --> 00:49:43.000]   knowing the very presence of God is with him now,
[00:49:43.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   was with him before,
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:48.000]   and will be with him forevermore.
[00:49:48.000 --> 00:49:51.000]   That's eternal security, amen?
[00:49:51.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   That's comfort for the soul, amen?
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:55.000]   To know in our hearts
[00:49:55.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   that no earthly created thing,
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:49:59.000]   no experience or circumstance,
[00:49:59.000 --> 00:50:04.000]   not even time itself,
[00:50:04.000 --> 00:50:07.000]   will separate us from the love of God. Why?
[00:50:07.000 --> 00:50:10.000]   Every single piece of that was by God's choice.
[00:50:10.000 --> 00:50:14.000]   Every single piece of that chain is all-inclusive.
[00:50:14.000 --> 00:50:17.000]   None of that is going to break.
[00:50:17.000 --> 00:50:20.000]   And so I want to encourage you guys.
[00:50:20.000 --> 00:50:21.000]   There are some of us in the room
[00:50:21.000 --> 00:50:24.000]   who do struggle with a sense of assurance.
[00:50:24.000 --> 00:50:25.000]   Why?
[00:50:25.000 --> 00:50:28.000]   You have your fair share of failures.
[00:50:28.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Look upon yourself,
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:32.000]   and you have tons of deficiencies.
[00:50:32.000 --> 00:50:35.000]   You lack so much.
[00:50:35.000 --> 00:50:37.000]   The doctrine of election,
[00:50:37.000 --> 00:50:40.000]   when was the last time you said to yourself,
[00:50:40.000 --> 00:50:43.000]   "Whoa, wait a minute.
[00:50:43.000 --> 00:50:46.000]   Because of salvation that God gives,
[00:50:46.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   the person that I am is not,
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:50.000]   'I am a Christian, and therefore,
[00:50:50.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   I'm just going to be a struggling Christian.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:53.000]   I should be a striving Christian.
[00:50:53.000 --> 00:50:55.000]   I should be a working Christian.'"
[00:50:55.000 --> 00:50:58.000]   The scriptures call you elect.
[00:50:58.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   That's your title.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:04.000]   And that gives us so much confidence,
[00:51:04.000 --> 00:51:08.000]   joy, assurance.
[00:51:08.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Yes, does the scripture talk about
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.000]   you need to examine yourself
[00:51:11.000 --> 00:51:14.000]   to see if you're of the faith? Yes.
[00:51:14.000 --> 00:51:15.000]   But when was the last time
[00:51:15.000 --> 00:51:17.000]   you verbally expressed to God,
[00:51:17.000 --> 00:51:20.000]   "Aside from all the things I see happening in life,
[00:51:20.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   aside also from seeing my track record,
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   I am convinced
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:29.000]   nothing will separate me from the love of Christ."
[00:51:29.000 --> 00:51:30.000]   Why?
[00:51:30.000 --> 00:51:32.000]   Because those he foreknew,
[00:51:32.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   he has predestined.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:36.000]   Those he predestined, he has justified.
[00:51:36.000 --> 00:51:40.000]   And those he justifies, he will glorify.
[00:51:40.000 --> 00:51:43.000]   The glorification is as good as done for a Christian
[00:51:43.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   because every bit of salvation
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:49.000]   has been by God's choice. Amen?
[00:51:49.000 --> 00:51:51.000]   As an example,
[00:51:51.000 --> 00:51:54.000]   the greatest example and story,
[00:51:54.000 --> 00:51:56.000]   one of the questions I posted on Facebook was,
[00:51:56.000 --> 00:51:58.000]   "What's a good story of election?
[00:51:58.000 --> 00:51:59.000]   What's the good analogy?
[00:51:59.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   What's the picture of election
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   that God has given to us from the scriptures?"
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   And that picture is none other than
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:10.000]   His choice nation, the nation of Israel.
[00:52:10.000 --> 00:52:12.000]   Another way to highlight this idea
[00:52:12.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   of the all-inclusive nature of God's election
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   is the all-inclusive blessings He gives
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:20.000]   when He promises. Right?
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.000]   When He gives promises,
[00:52:22.000 --> 00:52:24.000]   another way to think about election.
[00:52:24.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   And that's what I mean by
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   the all-inclusive nature of a promise.
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   Why? Because when He thinks about
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   the nation of Israel, this is what He says.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:34.000]   Turn your eyes now to Romans 4.
[00:52:34.000 --> 00:52:36.000]   Okay? Romans 4.
[00:52:36.000 --> 00:52:38.000]   Oh, my bad, my bad.
[00:52:38.000 --> 00:52:39.000]   I made a mistake.
[00:52:39.000 --> 00:52:41.000]   Romans 9, verse 4. Okay?
[00:52:41.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Romans 9, verse 4.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:45.000]   In Romans 9, verse 4,
[00:52:45.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   Apostle Paul is grieving over the fact
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   that he is praying for his own people,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:51.000]   his own kinsmen,
[00:52:51.000 --> 00:52:53.000]   but he recounts the incredible blessing
[00:52:53.000 --> 00:52:56.000]   that includes just about everything.
[00:52:56.000 --> 00:52:58.000]   And this is what he says.
[00:52:58.000 --> 00:53:01.000]   "The Israelites, who, to whom belongs
[00:53:01.000 --> 00:53:04.000]   the adoption as sons,
[00:53:04.000 --> 00:53:07.000]   and the glory, and the covenants,
[00:53:07.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   and the giving of the law,
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:10.000]   and the temple service,
[00:53:10.000 --> 00:53:11.000]   and the promises,
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   whose are the fathers,
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   and from whom is Christ
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:17.000]   according to the flesh."
[00:53:17.000 --> 00:53:18.000]   When did the nation of Israel
[00:53:18.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   ask for any of that?
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   If you have ever heard the picture
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:26.000]   of some idea that your salvation
[00:53:26.000 --> 00:53:29.000]   is kind of like you're drowning in the ocean,
[00:53:29.000 --> 00:53:30.000]   and then because you're drowning in the ocean,
[00:53:30.000 --> 00:53:32.000]   you can't make it to the sea,
[00:53:32.000 --> 00:53:33.000]   God comes in a helicopter,
[00:53:33.000 --> 00:53:34.000]   and He comes on a ladder,
[00:53:34.000 --> 00:53:35.000]   and you have to grab it.
[00:53:35.000 --> 00:53:37.000]   Let me ask you a question.
[00:53:37.000 --> 00:53:40.000]   When was any of this stuff
[00:53:40.000 --> 00:53:42.000]   something that the nation of Israel said,
[00:53:42.000 --> 00:53:44.000]   "Help me, come, give me the ladder.
[00:53:44.000 --> 00:53:45.000]   Come, give me the covenants.
[00:53:45.000 --> 00:53:47.000]   Give me the law."
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   None of this stuff
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:51.000]   are things that humankind
[00:53:51.000 --> 00:53:54.000]   could even imagine asking for.
[00:53:54.000 --> 00:53:55.000]   Every one of these blessings
[00:53:55.000 --> 00:53:57.000]   were given by God by His choice
[00:53:57.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   and His purpose.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:00.000]   And that's what I'm saying.
[00:54:00.000 --> 00:54:03.000]   Appreciate about the all-inclusive
[00:54:03.000 --> 00:54:04.000]   purpose of God,
[00:54:04.000 --> 00:54:07.000]   that His choice was not just simply
[00:54:07.000 --> 00:54:09.000]   a moment of time,
[00:54:09.000 --> 00:54:11.000]   a decree from old,
[00:54:11.000 --> 00:54:12.000]   but it was all-inclusive
[00:54:12.000 --> 00:54:14.000]   of every nature of salvation.
[00:54:14.000 --> 00:54:15.000]   Amen?
[00:54:15.000 --> 00:54:17.000]   But the part of it is,
[00:54:17.000 --> 00:54:19.000]   point two,
[00:54:19.000 --> 00:54:21.000]   the hard part actually is that
[00:54:21.000 --> 00:54:24.000]   this blessing was very exclusive.
[00:54:24.000 --> 00:54:25.000]   But it's on us now
[00:54:25.000 --> 00:54:27.000]   to receive this teaching
[00:54:27.000 --> 00:54:31.000]   that this blessing is very exclusive,
[00:54:31.000 --> 00:54:32.000]   and appreciate the fact
[00:54:32.000 --> 00:54:34.000]   that it was intentionally so.
[00:54:34.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   So I highlight this element of election
[00:54:36.000 --> 00:54:39.000]   revealed to us in Romans 9,
[00:54:39.000 --> 00:54:41.000]   that the election of God
[00:54:41.000 --> 00:54:44.000]   is intentionally exclusive.
[00:54:44.000 --> 00:54:45.000]   We must appreciate
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   the intentionally exclusive nature
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:50.000]   of God's choice.
[00:54:50.000 --> 00:54:52.000]   So what I'm making the point about it is,
[00:54:52.000 --> 00:54:55.000]   there is obviously an exclusive nature to it.
[00:54:55.000 --> 00:54:58.000]   God said this is the way it was.
[00:54:58.000 --> 00:54:59.000]   And there may be a complaint like,
[00:54:59.000 --> 00:55:01.000]   "Wait a minute.
[00:55:01.000 --> 00:55:02.000]   You're saying all these promises
[00:55:02.000 --> 00:55:04.000]   God planned and He decreed,
[00:55:04.000 --> 00:55:06.000]   and He chose the nation of Israel,
[00:55:06.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   and one of the accusations is,
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:08.000]   'Look, the nation of Israel,
[00:55:08.000 --> 00:55:10.000]   the vast majority of them
[00:55:10.000 --> 00:55:11.000]   rejected Christ.
[00:55:11.000 --> 00:55:12.000]   The vast majority of them
[00:55:12.000 --> 00:55:14.000]   constantly fell to their sin.
[00:55:14.000 --> 00:55:15.000]   And look at them.
[00:55:15.000 --> 00:55:17.000]   They're experiencing the consequences
[00:55:17.000 --> 00:55:19.000]   of their rejection.
[00:55:19.000 --> 00:55:21.000]   What gives?
[00:55:21.000 --> 00:55:24.000]   Why is the blessing not secure?"
[00:55:24.000 --> 00:55:25.000]   And the apostle Paul says,
[00:55:25.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   "Wait a minute.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:29.000]   You have this weird presumption.
[00:55:29.000 --> 00:55:31.000]   Not everybody in Israel
[00:55:31.000 --> 00:55:35.000]   was a child of promise."
[00:55:35.000 --> 00:55:37.000]   Let me read you the passage.
[00:55:37.000 --> 00:55:39.000]   It says here in Romans 9,
[00:55:39.000 --> 00:55:40.000]   verse 6-13,
[00:55:40.000 --> 00:55:41.000]   which is the center crux
[00:55:41.000 --> 00:55:43.000]   of our sermon today,
[00:55:43.000 --> 00:55:45.000]   he says, starting from verse 6,
[00:55:45.000 --> 00:55:46.000]   "It is not as though
[00:55:46.000 --> 00:55:48.000]   the word of God has failed,
[00:55:48.000 --> 00:55:50.000]   for they are not all Israel
[00:55:50.000 --> 00:55:53.000]   who are descendants from Israel,
[00:55:53.000 --> 00:55:54.000]   nor are they all children
[00:55:54.000 --> 00:55:55.000]   because they are not
[00:55:55.000 --> 00:55:57.000]   Abraham's descendants.
[00:55:57.000 --> 00:55:58.000]   But through Isaac,
[00:55:58.000 --> 00:56:00.000]   your descendants will be named."
[00:56:00.000 --> 00:56:02.000]   God said, "Remember,
[00:56:02.000 --> 00:56:05.000]   you have this weird presumption
[00:56:05.000 --> 00:56:06.000]   that every single person
[00:56:06.000 --> 00:56:08.000]   who has a drop of Abraham's blood
[00:56:08.000 --> 00:56:09.000]   is going to be saved.
[00:56:09.000 --> 00:56:11.000]   But I always told you
[00:56:11.000 --> 00:56:12.000]   that it was going to be
[00:56:12.000 --> 00:56:13.000]   through a specific person
[00:56:13.000 --> 00:56:17.000]   of my choice, namely Isaac."
[00:56:17.000 --> 00:56:18.000]   And he says, "That is,
[00:56:18.000 --> 00:56:20.000]   it is not the children of the flesh."
[00:56:20.000 --> 00:56:21.000]   Again, it's not flesh,
[00:56:21.000 --> 00:56:22.000]   it's not blood,
[00:56:22.000 --> 00:56:25.000]   but it's the children of promise.
[00:56:25.000 --> 00:56:26.000]   You can insert the idea
[00:56:26.000 --> 00:56:28.000]   of sovereign choice there.
[00:56:28.000 --> 00:56:30.000]   "Who are regarded as descendants,
[00:56:30.000 --> 00:56:33.000]   for this is the word of promise.
[00:56:33.000 --> 00:56:35.000]   At this time I will come
[00:56:35.000 --> 00:56:38.000]   and Sarah shall have a son."
[00:56:38.000 --> 00:56:40.000]   Again, even after Isaac,
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:43.000]   God chose a specific son.
[00:56:43.000 --> 00:56:45.000]   Verse 10, "Not only this,
[00:56:45.000 --> 00:56:47.000]   but there was Rebekah also
[00:56:47.000 --> 00:56:49.000]   when she had conceived twins
[00:56:49.000 --> 00:56:51.000]   by one man, father Isaac,
[00:56:51.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   for though the twins
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:56:53.000]   were not yet born
[00:56:53.000 --> 00:56:57.000]   and had not done anything good or bad,
[00:56:57.000 --> 00:56:59.000]   so that God's purpose
[00:56:59.000 --> 00:57:04.000]   according to His choice would stand.
[00:57:04.000 --> 00:57:06.000]   Not because of works,
[00:57:06.000 --> 00:57:08.000]   but because of Him who calls."
[00:57:08.000 --> 00:57:09.000]   That verse right there
[00:57:09.000 --> 00:57:11.000]   disproves this idea
[00:57:11.000 --> 00:57:12.000]   that God looked through
[00:57:12.000 --> 00:57:14.000]   the corridors of time,
[00:57:14.000 --> 00:57:17.000]   saw who would exercise faith.
[00:57:17.000 --> 00:57:20.000]   He says, "No, before you even exist
[00:57:20.000 --> 00:57:21.000]   or have any opportunity
[00:57:21.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   to exercise anything,
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:26.000]   I've already chosen."
[00:57:26.000 --> 00:57:28.000]   And then he says, verse 12,
[00:57:28.000 --> 00:57:30.000]   "It was said to her,
[00:57:30.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   'The older will serve the younger,'
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:34.000]   just as it is written,
[00:57:34.000 --> 00:57:38.000]   'Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated.'"
[00:57:38.000 --> 00:57:42.000]   This is a very, very interesting
[00:57:42.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   portion of scripture,
[00:57:44.000 --> 00:57:45.000]   and you could already tell
[00:57:45.000 --> 00:57:46.000]   why many people
[00:57:46.000 --> 00:57:48.000]   would have trouble with that.
[00:57:48.000 --> 00:57:50.000]   How can God say,
[00:57:50.000 --> 00:57:54.000]   "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated"?
[00:57:54.000 --> 00:57:57.000]   It's a very difficult thing to overcome.
[00:57:57.000 --> 00:57:59.000]   And just to emphatically, I guess,
[00:57:59.000 --> 00:58:00.000]   highlight that a little more,
[00:58:00.000 --> 00:58:04.000]   I would like you to turn to Malachi 1,
[00:58:04.000 --> 00:58:06.000]   and I want you to understand
[00:58:06.000 --> 00:58:09.000]   that's not even just one person.
[00:58:09.000 --> 00:58:11.000]   Meaning, when he says,
[00:58:11.000 --> 00:58:13.000]   "Jacob I loved, but Esau I hated,"
[00:58:13.000 --> 00:58:16.000]   is he just talking about Jacob and Esau?
[00:58:16.000 --> 00:58:18.000]   No, he's talking about
[00:58:18.000 --> 00:58:20.000]   their entire lineage.
[00:58:20.000 --> 00:58:22.000]   Take a look in Malachi 1,
[00:58:22.000 --> 00:58:24.000]   verse 1 through 5, he says,
[00:58:24.000 --> 00:58:26.000]   "The oracle of the word of the Lord
[00:58:26.000 --> 00:58:28.000]   to Israel through Malachi,
[00:58:28.000 --> 00:58:31.000]   'I have loved you,' says the Lord.
[00:58:31.000 --> 00:58:33.000]   But you say, 'How?
[00:58:33.000 --> 00:58:35.000]   How have you loved us?
[00:58:35.000 --> 00:58:37.000]   Was not Esau Jacob's brother?'
[00:58:37.000 --> 00:58:38.000]   declares the Lord.
[00:58:38.000 --> 00:58:40.000]   Yet I have loved Jacob,
[00:58:40.000 --> 00:58:42.000]   but I have hated Esau,
[00:58:42.000 --> 00:58:45.000]   and I have made his mountains a desolation,
[00:58:45.000 --> 00:58:46.000]   appointed his inheritance
[00:58:46.000 --> 00:58:48.000]   for the jackals of the wilderness.
[00:58:48.000 --> 00:58:50.000]   And though Edom says,
[00:58:50.000 --> 00:58:52.000]   'We have been beaten down,
[00:58:52.000 --> 00:58:54.000]   but we will return and build up the ruins.'"
[00:58:54.000 --> 00:58:57.000]   So the Edomites are all the lineage of Esau,
[00:58:57.000 --> 00:58:59.000]   and they keep saying,
[00:58:59.000 --> 00:59:00.000]   "Oh my gosh, we're going to,
[00:59:00.000 --> 00:59:01.000]   you know, we've suffered,
[00:59:01.000 --> 00:59:03.000]   and yes, we've lost battles,
[00:59:03.000 --> 00:59:04.000]   and we've been conquered,
[00:59:04.000 --> 00:59:05.000]   but don't worry,
[00:59:05.000 --> 00:59:06.000]   we'll rebuild ourselves."
[00:59:06.000 --> 00:59:08.000]   And God says, "No."
[00:59:08.000 --> 00:59:10.000]   "Thus says the Lord of hosts,
[00:59:10.000 --> 00:59:13.000]   'They may build, but I will tear down.'
[00:59:13.000 --> 00:59:15.000]   And men will call them
[00:59:15.000 --> 00:59:17.000]   the wicked territory,
[00:59:17.000 --> 00:59:18.000]   and the people toward whom
[00:59:18.000 --> 00:59:20.000]   the Lord is indignant forever.
[00:59:20.000 --> 00:59:22.000]   Your eyes will see this,
[00:59:22.000 --> 00:59:23.000]   and you will say,
[00:59:23.000 --> 00:59:25.000]   'The Lord be magnified
[00:59:25.000 --> 00:59:28.000]   beyond the border of Israel.'"
[00:59:28.000 --> 00:59:31.000]   This is pretty hard for us to take,
[00:59:31.000 --> 00:59:33.000]   but I want you to remember
[00:59:33.000 --> 00:59:35.000]   that what God is saying here
[00:59:35.000 --> 00:59:37.000]   is number one,
[00:59:37.000 --> 00:59:39.000]   the choice that I give,
[00:59:39.000 --> 00:59:41.000]   it's mine to give,
[00:59:41.000 --> 00:59:44.000]   and intentionally so.
[00:59:44.000 --> 00:59:47.000]   And though, yes, you might complain,
[00:59:47.000 --> 00:59:49.000]   "Wait, that doesn't make sense."
[00:59:49.000 --> 00:59:52.000]   It does not make sense
[00:59:52.000 --> 00:59:55.000]   that God would take an entire nation,
[00:59:55.000 --> 00:59:57.000]   and then he would hate them
[00:59:57.000 --> 00:59:59.000]   to such a degree
[00:59:59.000 --> 01:00:01.000]   that he keeps pushing them
[01:00:01.000 --> 01:00:05.000]   to experience ruin.
[01:00:05.000 --> 01:00:06.000]   Charles Spurgeon,
[01:00:06.000 --> 01:00:08.000]   he was describing this,
[01:00:08.000 --> 01:00:10.000]   and he talked about how
[01:00:10.000 --> 01:00:11.000]   one of his students,
[01:00:11.000 --> 01:00:12.000]   this comes from one of his sermons
[01:00:12.000 --> 01:00:13.000]   and the lectures to my students,
[01:00:13.000 --> 01:00:14.000]   students said,
[01:00:14.000 --> 01:00:15.000]   "I have great, great trouble
[01:00:15.000 --> 01:00:17.000]   with this verse.
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:20.000]   How can God just say, 'Esau, I hated'?"
[01:00:20.000 --> 01:00:22.000]   And Spurgeon responded,
[01:00:22.000 --> 01:00:23.000]   "Rather than asking,
[01:00:23.000 --> 01:00:26.000]   'How can God say, 'Esau, I hated,'
[01:00:26.000 --> 01:00:27.000]   I asked the question,
[01:00:27.000 --> 01:00:32.000]   'How can he say, 'Jacob, I loved'?"
[01:00:32.000 --> 01:00:35.000]   That pretty much starts to dig at
[01:00:35.000 --> 01:00:37.000]   what are the presumptions,
[01:00:37.000 --> 01:00:39.000]   the false assumptions
[01:00:39.000 --> 01:00:42.000]   that we have in our mind.
[01:00:42.000 --> 01:00:43.000]   Question,
[01:00:43.000 --> 01:00:47.000]   do we see God as the government?
[01:00:47.000 --> 01:00:49.000]   Does God run programs
[01:00:49.000 --> 01:00:53.000]   by which everybody should be able to apply?
[01:00:53.000 --> 01:00:56.000]   Do we see God as an institution?
[01:00:56.000 --> 01:00:58.000]   He is the great, great school
[01:00:58.000 --> 01:00:59.000]   by which everybody should have
[01:00:59.000 --> 01:01:02.000]   the opportunity to apply.
[01:01:02.000 --> 01:01:06.000]   Do we see him as some kind of program?
[01:01:06.000 --> 01:01:08.000]   Do we see him essentially as
[01:01:08.000 --> 01:01:09.000]   maybe like a policy
[01:01:09.000 --> 01:01:10.000]   that we should hold at church?
[01:01:10.000 --> 01:01:12.000]   We have this policy.
[01:01:12.000 --> 01:01:15.000]   We reject nobody.
[01:01:15.000 --> 01:01:17.000]   Those are false assumptions
[01:01:17.000 --> 01:01:20.000]   we have embedded into our mind
[01:01:20.000 --> 01:01:22.000]   in the way that we see God.
[01:01:22.000 --> 01:01:24.000]   But a better picture of this
[01:01:24.000 --> 01:01:27.000]   is to say no individual
[01:01:27.000 --> 01:01:29.000]   can go to God and apply to him
[01:01:29.000 --> 01:01:32.000]   and say, "Yes, I know I'm a wretched sinner.
[01:01:32.000 --> 01:01:34.000]   Yes, I know I'm living in filth,
[01:01:34.000 --> 01:01:40.000]   but make me your wife."
[01:01:40.000 --> 01:01:42.000]   There is no right we have
[01:01:42.000 --> 01:01:44.000]   to go to God and say,
[01:01:44.000 --> 01:01:46.000]   "That's not fair.
[01:01:46.000 --> 01:01:49.000]   Why don't you make me your child?"
[01:01:49.000 --> 01:01:51.000]   We're thinking about it the wrong way
[01:01:51.000 --> 01:01:53.000]   when we all of a sudden think
[01:01:53.000 --> 01:01:56.000]   that it's wrong for God to choose.
[01:01:56.000 --> 01:01:59.000]   There's a lot of false assumptions,
[01:01:59.000 --> 01:02:02.000]   but I want to also highlight to us
[01:02:02.000 --> 01:02:05.000]   God highlights to challenge our assumptions,
[01:02:05.000 --> 01:02:07.000]   to go against cultural norms.
[01:02:07.000 --> 01:02:09.000]   It's cultural to pick the firstborn,
[01:02:09.000 --> 01:02:12.000]   and God says, "I'm not going to do that."
[01:02:12.000 --> 01:02:13.000]   It's cultural to make sure
[01:02:13.000 --> 01:02:15.000]   we pick these individuals who have this
[01:02:15.000 --> 01:02:18.000]   because for us, we always somehow
[01:02:18.000 --> 01:02:21.000]   work by merit.
[01:02:21.000 --> 01:02:24.000]   God says, "No, not my choice."
[01:02:24.000 --> 01:02:27.000]   My choice is mercy.
[01:02:27.000 --> 01:02:30.000]   That's what we move to in number three.
[01:02:30.000 --> 01:02:32.000]   The third point of it is what we need
[01:02:32.000 --> 01:02:34.000]   to appreciate is God says,
[01:02:34.000 --> 01:02:35.000]   "Yes, it's my choice.
[01:02:35.000 --> 01:02:37.000]   Yes, it's my prerogative."
[01:02:37.000 --> 01:02:39.000]   That's what the passage says.
[01:02:39.000 --> 01:02:42.000]   You have any idea how little
[01:02:42.000 --> 01:02:45.000]   you have in your salvation.
[01:02:45.000 --> 01:02:47.000]   Again, not to take away from the fact
[01:02:47.000 --> 01:02:48.000]   that we have to repent,
[01:02:48.000 --> 01:02:49.000]   we have to receive,
[01:02:49.000 --> 01:02:51.000]   we have to submit ourselves to the Word of God.
[01:02:51.000 --> 01:02:54.000]   All of that is true,
[01:02:54.000 --> 01:02:57.000]   but God says, "Not by man who runs,
[01:02:57.000 --> 01:02:59.000]   but my choice will stand."
[01:02:59.000 --> 01:03:01.000]   It's so emphatic.
[01:03:01.000 --> 01:03:02.000]   What he says, though, is,
[01:03:02.000 --> 01:03:04.000]   "But I want you to understand
[01:03:04.000 --> 01:03:06.000]   this choice is not arbitrary.
[01:03:06.000 --> 01:03:08.000]   It's not cold. It's not mechanical,
[01:03:08.000 --> 01:03:11.000]   and I don't operate by policy."
[01:03:11.000 --> 01:03:12.000]   Praise the Lord.
[01:03:12.000 --> 01:03:15.000]   God does not operate by policy.
[01:03:15.000 --> 01:03:19.000]   God operates by personal mercy.
[01:03:19.000 --> 01:03:21.000]   Take a look at verse 14 of chapter 9,
[01:03:21.000 --> 01:03:24.000]   Romans 9.14.
[01:03:24.000 --> 01:03:26.000]   Romans 9.14, it says this,
[01:03:26.000 --> 01:03:28.000]   "What shall we say then?
[01:03:28.000 --> 01:03:30.000]   There is no injustice with God, is there?
[01:03:30.000 --> 01:03:34.000]   May it never be," strongest negative.
[01:03:34.000 --> 01:03:36.000]   "May it never be that God is unjust
[01:03:36.000 --> 01:03:38.000]   for being exclusive,
[01:03:38.000 --> 01:03:40.000]   for being intentionally exclusive.
[01:03:40.000 --> 01:03:42.000]   For he says to Moses,
[01:03:42.000 --> 01:03:45.000]   'I will have mercy on whom I have mercy,
[01:03:45.000 --> 01:03:47.000]   and I will have compassion
[01:03:47.000 --> 01:03:49.000]   on whom I have compassion.'"
[01:03:49.000 --> 01:03:52.000]   So then, it does not depend on man who wills
[01:03:52.000 --> 01:03:53.000]   or man who runs,
[01:03:53.000 --> 01:03:57.000]   but on God who has mercy.
[01:03:57.000 --> 01:04:01.000]   Skipping down to verse 19,
[01:04:01.000 --> 01:04:02.000]   or actually I'll pause there
[01:04:02.000 --> 01:04:06.000]   and then meditate on this for a little bit.
[01:04:06.000 --> 01:04:11.000]   God says that His sovereign election
[01:04:11.000 --> 01:04:16.000]   is not by anybody who runs, who toils.
[01:04:16.000 --> 01:04:19.000]   Obviously, I'm going to do this side
[01:04:19.000 --> 01:04:20.000]   versus that side.
[01:04:20.000 --> 01:04:21.000]   Okay?
[01:04:21.000 --> 01:04:24.000]   Excuse me.
[01:04:24.000 --> 01:04:26.000]   On this side,
[01:04:26.000 --> 01:04:27.000]   I want you to imagine
[01:04:27.000 --> 01:04:30.000]   one way of thinking about salvation,
[01:04:30.000 --> 01:04:32.000]   survivor island.
[01:04:32.000 --> 01:04:33.000]   Okay?
[01:04:33.000 --> 01:04:35.000]   Deprivation of resources.
[01:04:35.000 --> 01:04:37.000]   You know you're lost.
[01:04:37.000 --> 01:04:38.000]   Okay?
[01:04:38.000 --> 01:04:40.000]   I.e., you're depraved and all of that.
[01:04:40.000 --> 01:04:41.000]   But nevertheless,
[01:04:41.000 --> 01:04:43.000]   there's a survival that we must.
[01:04:43.000 --> 01:04:44.000]   We must go seek out.
[01:04:44.000 --> 01:04:45.000]   Right?
[01:04:45.000 --> 01:04:46.000]   We must go seek out resources.
[01:04:46.000 --> 01:04:47.000]   We must go seek out rescue.
[01:04:47.000 --> 01:04:49.000]   We must go da-da-da-da-da.
[01:04:49.000 --> 01:04:50.000]   Or another way to picture it.
[01:04:50.000 --> 01:04:51.000]   Earlier, I described
[01:04:51.000 --> 01:04:54.000]   one of the famous pictures of salvation.
[01:04:54.000 --> 01:04:55.000]   Because people would say,
[01:04:55.000 --> 01:04:57.000]   you're in a vast, vast ocean, so big,
[01:04:57.000 --> 01:05:00.000]   you could not possibly swim to shore.
[01:05:00.000 --> 01:05:02.000]   You're drowning there.
[01:05:02.000 --> 01:05:03.000]   And so, upon calling for help,
[01:05:03.000 --> 01:05:05.000]   God comes with this rescue boat
[01:05:05.000 --> 01:05:07.000]   and is now up to you
[01:05:07.000 --> 01:05:10.000]   to grab on to his life,
[01:05:10.000 --> 01:05:12.000]   you know, little circle thingy, buoy.
[01:05:12.000 --> 01:05:14.000]   Cling to it.
[01:05:14.000 --> 01:05:15.000]   Right?
[01:05:15.000 --> 01:05:17.000]   That is not the way
[01:05:17.000 --> 01:05:22.000]   that God has envisioned His mercy.
[01:05:22.000 --> 01:05:24.000]   Throwing to us the lifeline
[01:05:24.000 --> 01:05:27.000]   is not God's mercy.
[01:05:27.000 --> 01:05:29.000]   That's a gross injustice
[01:05:29.000 --> 01:05:30.000]   to the level of mercy
[01:05:30.000 --> 01:05:32.000]   He chose to give.
[01:05:32.000 --> 01:05:34.000]   Amen?
[01:05:34.000 --> 01:05:36.000]   What's the right picture?
[01:05:36.000 --> 01:05:38.000]   I mentioned to you the nation of Israel
[01:05:38.000 --> 01:05:40.000]   is the analogy, is the picture
[01:05:40.000 --> 01:05:42.000]   that God wants us to think about.
[01:05:42.000 --> 01:05:44.000]   And He actually describes it
[01:05:44.000 --> 01:05:45.000]   from His perspective
[01:05:45.000 --> 01:05:47.000]   in Ezekiel chapter 16.
[01:05:47.000 --> 01:05:48.000]   It's a longer passage,
[01:05:48.000 --> 01:05:50.000]   so walk through with me.
[01:05:50.000 --> 01:06:03.000]   Ezekiel 16, verses 1 through 15.
[01:06:03.000 --> 01:06:04.000]   And we're trying to appreciate the fact
[01:06:04.000 --> 01:06:08.000]   that when God says, "I have chosen you,"
[01:06:08.000 --> 01:06:10.000]   if we think of it
[01:06:10.000 --> 01:06:12.000]   as any kind of picture
[01:06:12.000 --> 01:06:14.000]   we can think of on earth,
[01:06:14.000 --> 01:06:16.000]   where we throw lifelines,
[01:06:16.000 --> 01:06:18.000]   we give people a break,
[01:06:18.000 --> 01:06:19.000]   we give second chances.
[01:06:19.000 --> 01:06:21.000]   I've heard so many times,
[01:06:21.000 --> 01:06:23.000]   like, "God is a God of second chances."
[01:06:23.000 --> 01:06:24.000]   And I realize, yeah,
[01:06:24.000 --> 01:06:25.000]   that what we're doing
[01:06:25.000 --> 01:06:27.000]   is we're trying to envision
[01:06:27.000 --> 01:06:30.000]   the level and depth of His mercy.
[01:06:30.000 --> 01:06:32.000]   And that's good.
[01:06:32.000 --> 01:06:36.000]   But oftentimes it's still too little.
[01:06:36.000 --> 01:06:38.000]   Take a look at this in verse 1.
[01:06:38.000 --> 01:06:40.000]   It says, "Then the word of the Lord
[01:06:40.000 --> 01:06:42.000]   came to me, saying,
[01:06:42.000 --> 01:06:44.000]   'Son of man, make known to Jerusalem
[01:06:44.000 --> 01:06:46.000]   her abominations,
[01:06:46.000 --> 01:06:48.000]   and say,
[01:06:48.000 --> 01:06:51.000]   'Thus says the Lord of Jerusalem,
[01:06:51.000 --> 01:06:52.000]   "Your origin and your birth
[01:06:52.000 --> 01:06:54.000]   are from the land of the Canaanites.
[01:06:54.000 --> 01:06:55.000]   Your father was an Amorite,
[01:06:55.000 --> 01:06:57.000]   and your mother a Hittite.
[01:06:57.000 --> 01:06:59.000]   As for your birth,
[01:06:59.000 --> 01:07:00.000]   on the day you were born,
[01:07:00.000 --> 01:07:02.000]   your navel cord was not cut,
[01:07:02.000 --> 01:07:05.000]   nor were you washed with water for cleansing.
[01:07:05.000 --> 01:07:07.000]   You were not rubbed with salt
[01:07:07.000 --> 01:07:09.000]   or even wrapped in cloth.
[01:07:09.000 --> 01:07:12.000]   No eye looked with pity on you
[01:07:12.000 --> 01:07:14.000]   to do any of the things for you,
[01:07:14.000 --> 01:07:17.000]   to have compassion on you.
[01:07:17.000 --> 01:07:18.000]   Rather, you were thrown out
[01:07:18.000 --> 01:07:20.000]   into the open field,
[01:07:20.000 --> 01:07:21.000]   for you were abhorred
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:23.000]   on the day you were born.
[01:07:23.000 --> 01:07:24.000]   When I passed by you
[01:07:24.000 --> 01:07:26.000]   and saw you squirming in your blood,
[01:07:26.000 --> 01:07:28.000]   I said to you,
[01:07:28.000 --> 01:07:30.000]   'While you were in your blood,
[01:07:30.000 --> 01:07:32.000]   live.'"
[01:07:32.000 --> 01:07:33.000]   Yes, I said to you,
[01:07:33.000 --> 01:07:35.000]   "While you were in your blood,
[01:07:35.000 --> 01:07:37.000]   live."
[01:07:37.000 --> 01:07:38.000]   You have to picture
[01:07:38.000 --> 01:07:42.000]   the incredible devastation.
[01:07:42.000 --> 01:07:46.000]   To think we are even in the ocean,
[01:07:46.000 --> 01:07:48.000]   trying to float,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:50.000]   is not enough
[01:07:50.000 --> 01:07:52.000]   to look at our demise,
[01:07:52.000 --> 01:07:55.000]   to look at the sad state of man.
[01:07:55.000 --> 01:07:56.000]   We are as good as dead.
[01:07:56.000 --> 01:07:57.000]   Verse 7,
[01:07:57.000 --> 01:07:58.000]   "I made you numerous
[01:07:58.000 --> 01:08:00.000]   like the plants of the field.
[01:08:00.000 --> 01:08:01.000]   Then you grew up,
[01:08:01.000 --> 01:08:02.000]   became tall,
[01:08:02.000 --> 01:08:03.000]   and reached the age
[01:08:03.000 --> 01:08:04.000]   for fine ornaments.
[01:08:04.000 --> 01:08:05.000]   Your breasts were formed
[01:08:05.000 --> 01:08:06.000]   and your hair had grown,
[01:08:06.000 --> 01:08:08.000]   yet you were naked and bare,
[01:08:08.000 --> 01:08:11.000]   still full of shame."
[01:08:11.000 --> 01:08:12.000]   Verse 8,
[01:08:12.000 --> 01:08:13.000]   "Then I passed by you
[01:08:13.000 --> 01:08:14.000]   and saw you,
[01:08:14.000 --> 01:08:15.000]   and behold,
[01:08:15.000 --> 01:08:16.000]   you were at that time for love.
[01:08:16.000 --> 01:08:17.000]   So I spread my Spirit over you,
[01:08:17.000 --> 01:08:18.000]   covered your nakedness.
[01:08:18.000 --> 01:08:20.000]   I also swore to you,
[01:08:20.000 --> 01:08:21.000]   entered into a covenant with you,
[01:08:21.000 --> 01:08:24.000]   so that you became mine,
[01:08:24.000 --> 01:08:27.000]   declares the Lord God.
[01:08:27.000 --> 01:08:28.000]   Then I bathed you with water,
[01:08:28.000 --> 01:08:30.000]   washed off your blood from you,
[01:08:30.000 --> 01:08:31.000]   anointed you with oil.
[01:08:31.000 --> 01:08:32.000]   I also clothed you
[01:08:32.000 --> 01:08:34.000]   with embroidered cloth.
[01:08:34.000 --> 01:08:35.000]   I put sandals
[01:08:35.000 --> 01:08:37.000]   of porpoise skin on your feet,
[01:08:37.000 --> 01:08:38.000]   and I wrapped you with fine linen,
[01:08:38.000 --> 01:08:41.000]   covered you with silk.
[01:08:41.000 --> 01:08:43.000]   I adorned you with ornaments,
[01:08:43.000 --> 01:08:45.000]   put bracelets on your hands,
[01:08:45.000 --> 01:08:46.000]   a necklace around your neck.
[01:08:46.000 --> 01:08:48.000]   I put a ring in your nostril,
[01:08:48.000 --> 01:08:49.000]   earrings in your ears,
[01:08:49.000 --> 01:08:51.000]   beautiful crown on your head.
[01:08:51.000 --> 01:08:53.000]   Thus you were adorned
[01:08:53.000 --> 01:08:55.000]   with gold and silver,
[01:08:55.000 --> 01:08:56.000]   and your dress was of fine linen,
[01:08:56.000 --> 01:08:58.000]   silk and embroidered cloth.
[01:08:58.000 --> 01:09:00.000]   You ate fine flour, honey and oil,
[01:09:00.000 --> 01:09:02.000]   so you were exceedingly beautiful,
[01:09:02.000 --> 01:09:04.000]   advanced in royalty."
[01:09:04.000 --> 01:09:05.000]   Listen to this,
[01:09:05.000 --> 01:09:07.000]   "Then your fame went forth
[01:09:07.000 --> 01:09:08.000]   among the nations
[01:09:08.000 --> 01:09:09.000]   on account of your beauty,
[01:09:09.000 --> 01:09:11.000]   for it was perfect
[01:09:11.000 --> 01:09:13.000]   because of my splendor,"
[01:09:13.000 --> 01:09:14.000]   insert,
[01:09:14.000 --> 01:09:16.000]   "which I chose
[01:09:16.000 --> 01:09:19.000]   to bestow on you."
[01:09:19.000 --> 01:09:23.000]   The election is incredible mercy of God
[01:09:23.000 --> 01:09:26.000]   to bestow Himself
[01:09:26.000 --> 01:09:27.000]   and His own glories
[01:09:27.000 --> 01:09:31.000]   upon His simple created beings.
[01:09:31.000 --> 01:09:33.000]   However, the story, as you know,
[01:09:33.000 --> 01:09:35.000]   is one of tragedy
[01:09:35.000 --> 01:09:36.000]   because in verse 15, He says,
[01:09:36.000 --> 01:09:37.000]   "But you,
[01:09:37.000 --> 01:09:39.000]   you trusted in your beauty,
[01:09:39.000 --> 01:09:40.000]   played the harlot
[01:09:40.000 --> 01:09:42.000]   because of your fame,
[01:09:42.000 --> 01:09:44.000]   and you poured out your holler trees
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.000]   on every pastor by
[01:09:46.000 --> 01:09:49.000]   who might be willing."
[01:09:49.000 --> 01:09:51.000]   Did God not know
[01:09:51.000 --> 01:09:54.000]   that those individuals
[01:09:54.000 --> 01:09:57.000]   upon which He lavished Himself,
[01:09:57.000 --> 01:10:00.000]   His love, His care,
[01:10:00.000 --> 01:10:02.000]   incredibly precise,
[01:10:02.000 --> 01:10:05.000]   incredibly intimate mercies upon
[01:10:05.000 --> 01:10:08.000]   would then play the harlot?
[01:10:08.000 --> 01:10:10.000]   Did He not know that the people
[01:10:10.000 --> 01:10:11.000]   to which whom He has given
[01:10:11.000 --> 01:10:13.000]   His mercy and grace to reveal,
[01:10:13.000 --> 01:10:15.000]   "I have chosen you from long ago
[01:10:15.000 --> 01:10:17.000]   before the foundations of the world,
[01:10:17.000 --> 01:10:18.000]   I thought of you,"
[01:10:18.000 --> 01:10:19.000]   would look at Him and say,
[01:10:19.000 --> 01:10:23.000]   "That doesn't seem fair."
[01:10:23.000 --> 01:10:27.000]   God in His willing, kind heart
[01:10:27.000 --> 01:10:31.000]   was so willing to endure all things.
[01:10:31.000 --> 01:10:34.000]   That's His choice of us.
[01:10:34.000 --> 01:10:37.000]   That is not something we can say
[01:10:37.000 --> 01:10:39.000]   we have a part in.
[01:10:39.000 --> 01:10:41.000]   And what I realize is
[01:10:41.000 --> 01:10:42.000]   the definitions of mercy
[01:10:42.000 --> 01:10:44.000]   that I used to think about.
[01:10:44.000 --> 01:10:45.000]   If you guys have heard probably
[01:10:45.000 --> 01:10:47.000]   in sermons before,
[01:10:47.000 --> 01:10:49.000]   I have probably said it multiple times.
[01:10:49.000 --> 01:10:50.000]   You know what mercy is?
[01:10:50.000 --> 01:10:52.000]   It's when God says,
[01:10:52.000 --> 01:10:54.000]   "You deserve my wrath.
[01:10:54.000 --> 01:10:55.000]   I'm not going to give it to you."
[01:10:55.000 --> 01:10:56.000]   Because mercy means
[01:10:56.000 --> 01:10:58.000]   you don't get what you deserve.
[01:10:58.000 --> 01:10:59.000]   Grace means you receive
[01:10:59.000 --> 01:11:01.000]   far more than you deserve.
[01:11:01.000 --> 01:11:03.000]   I'm going to lavish you with love.
[01:11:03.000 --> 01:11:06.000]   But I read a passage like this,
[01:11:06.000 --> 01:11:08.000]   mercy means so much more,
[01:11:08.000 --> 01:11:11.000]   doesn't it?
[01:11:11.000 --> 01:11:12.000]   In God's election,
[01:11:12.000 --> 01:11:14.000]   it's full of His heart.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:17.000]   In His perfect, all-sovereign sight
[01:11:17.000 --> 01:11:19.000]   of each and every one of you,
[01:11:19.000 --> 01:11:22.000]   He looks upon with pity.
[01:11:22.000 --> 01:11:25.000]   He's moved in His soul.
[01:11:25.000 --> 01:11:28.000]   And no, it is not an arbitrary,
[01:11:28.000 --> 01:11:30.000]   heartless, mechanical way of saying,
[01:11:30.000 --> 01:11:33.000]   "You, you, you, you, you."
[01:11:33.000 --> 01:11:35.000]   It is an incredibly personal
[01:11:35.000 --> 01:11:37.000]   display of mercy.
[01:11:37.000 --> 01:11:39.000]   That's what I'm trying to say.
[01:11:39.000 --> 01:11:40.000]   And every other picture
[01:11:40.000 --> 01:11:41.000]   by which we think,
[01:11:41.000 --> 01:11:42.000]   "Oh yeah, our election
[01:11:42.000 --> 01:11:44.000]   must be like this,"
[01:11:44.000 --> 01:11:46.000]   is probably going to fall short.
[01:11:46.000 --> 01:11:48.000]   So stop it.
[01:11:48.000 --> 01:11:51.000]   But rather, relish in the fact
[01:11:51.000 --> 01:11:54.000]   that we have been given this mercy
[01:11:54.000 --> 01:11:56.000]   to see this election of God
[01:11:56.000 --> 01:11:58.000]   and to receive it not as a theological point,
[01:11:58.000 --> 01:12:02.000]   but a show of His love,
[01:12:02.000 --> 01:12:04.000]   a show of His care,
[01:12:04.000 --> 01:12:05.000]   a show of the kindness
[01:12:05.000 --> 01:12:08.000]   He wants to show you.
[01:12:08.000 --> 01:12:11.000]   God has given you something
[01:12:11.000 --> 01:12:14.000]   completely unimaginable.
[01:12:14.000 --> 01:12:16.000]   We could not have devised it.
[01:12:16.000 --> 01:12:19.000]   We could not have brainstormed it.
[01:12:19.000 --> 01:12:20.000]   He has given us
[01:12:20.000 --> 01:12:22.000]   His sovereign election of mercy.
[01:12:22.000 --> 01:12:23.000]   Amen?
[01:12:23.000 --> 01:12:25.000]   And that's why God says,
[01:12:25.000 --> 01:12:27.000]   "What I'm trying to reveal to you
[01:12:27.000 --> 01:12:28.000]   is to my glory.
[01:12:28.000 --> 01:12:30.000]   My election is to show you
[01:12:30.000 --> 01:12:32.000]   the riches of my mercy."
[01:12:32.000 --> 01:12:35.000]   Point four, we must give glory to God
[01:12:35.000 --> 01:12:38.000]   for choosing to show us His mercy.
[01:12:38.000 --> 01:12:40.000]   The election, the doctrine of predestination
[01:12:40.000 --> 01:12:46.000]   is to us a great, great glory of God.
[01:12:46.000 --> 01:12:49.000]   An incredible display of His glory to us.
[01:12:49.000 --> 01:12:52.000]   Romans 9, starting from verse 19,
[01:12:52.000 --> 01:12:55.000]   He says, "You will say to me then,
[01:12:55.000 --> 01:12:57.000]   'Why does he still find fault
[01:12:57.000 --> 01:12:59.000]   for who resists his will?'"
[01:12:59.000 --> 01:13:01.000]   There's still a little bit of a,
[01:13:01.000 --> 01:13:02.000]   "Wait a minute."
[01:13:02.000 --> 01:13:03.000]   Right?
[01:13:03.000 --> 01:13:05.000]   If you're so sovereign and you choose,
[01:13:05.000 --> 01:13:07.000]   and you're so sovereign
[01:13:07.000 --> 01:13:09.000]   that you affect the mind of man,
[01:13:09.000 --> 01:13:10.000]   you affect the heart of man,
[01:13:10.000 --> 01:13:12.000]   and there's no recess,
[01:13:12.000 --> 01:13:13.000]   there's no little bit of my heart
[01:13:13.000 --> 01:13:15.000]   by which my freedom to choose
[01:13:15.000 --> 01:13:17.000]   is untouched by the hand of God,
[01:13:17.000 --> 01:13:19.000]   false.
[01:13:19.000 --> 01:13:21.000]   God can harden the mind,
[01:13:21.000 --> 01:13:22.000]   the heart hardens itself,
[01:13:22.000 --> 01:13:25.000]   but God can completely encrust it.
[01:13:25.000 --> 01:13:26.000]   God can give us over
[01:13:26.000 --> 01:13:28.000]   to the depraved desires of our heart.
[01:13:28.000 --> 01:13:29.000]   God can do all things,
[01:13:29.000 --> 01:13:30.000]   both in the physical world,
[01:13:30.000 --> 01:13:32.000]   both in the metaphysical world,
[01:13:32.000 --> 01:13:33.000]   all things spiritual,
[01:13:33.000 --> 01:13:34.000]   whatever it may be,
[01:13:34.000 --> 01:13:36.000]   we think we have a realm in,
[01:13:36.000 --> 01:13:39.000]   God says, "No, I have sovereignty."
[01:13:39.000 --> 01:13:41.000]   The mind says, "Well, wait a minute.
[01:13:41.000 --> 01:13:43.000]   That doesn't make sense."
[01:13:43.000 --> 01:13:45.000]   Verse 20, "Rather than answering our questions
[01:13:45.000 --> 01:13:47.000]   based on our questions," He says,
[01:13:47.000 --> 01:13:51.000]   "but on the contrary, who are you?
[01:13:51.000 --> 01:13:52.000]   Who are you, O man,
[01:13:52.000 --> 01:13:54.000]   who answers back to God,
[01:13:54.000 --> 01:13:56.000]   'The thing molded will not say to the molder,
[01:13:56.000 --> 01:13:58.000]   'Why did you make me like this?'
[01:13:58.000 --> 01:14:00.000]   Will it?
[01:14:00.000 --> 01:14:04.000]   Or does not the potter have the right over the clay
[01:14:04.000 --> 01:14:06.000]   to make from the same lump one vessel
[01:14:06.000 --> 01:14:09.000]   for honorable use and another for common use?
[01:14:09.000 --> 01:14:11.000]   What if God,
[01:14:11.000 --> 01:14:13.000]   although willing to demonstrate His wrath,
[01:14:13.000 --> 01:14:15.000]   to make His power known,
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.000]   endured with much patience
[01:14:17.000 --> 01:14:21.000]   vessels of wrath prepared for destruction?
[01:14:21.000 --> 01:14:23.000]   And He did so to make known,
[01:14:23.000 --> 01:14:24.000]   look at this,
[01:14:24.000 --> 01:14:28.000]   the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy,
[01:14:28.000 --> 01:14:32.000]   which He prepared beforehand for glory."
[01:14:32.000 --> 01:14:34.000]   Verse 24, "Yes, even us,
[01:14:34.000 --> 01:14:36.000]   whom He also called,
[01:14:36.000 --> 01:14:38.000]   not from among Jews only,
[01:14:38.000 --> 01:14:40.000]   but also from among the Gentiles,
[01:14:40.000 --> 01:14:42.000]   as He says also in Hosea,
[01:14:42.000 --> 01:14:44.000]   'I will call those who are not My people,
[01:14:44.000 --> 01:14:45.000]   My people,
[01:14:45.000 --> 01:14:48.000]   and her who was not beloved, beloved.'
[01:14:48.000 --> 01:14:49.000]   And it shall be that in the place
[01:14:49.000 --> 01:14:51.000]   where it was said to them,
[01:14:51.000 --> 01:14:52.000]   'You are not My people,'
[01:14:52.000 --> 01:14:54.000]   there they shall be called
[01:14:54.000 --> 01:14:56.000]   sons of the living God."
[01:14:56.000 --> 01:14:58.000]   So she called the incredible mercy of God
[01:14:58.000 --> 01:14:59.000]   to the prophet Hosea.
[01:14:59.000 --> 01:15:00.000]   He told Hosea,
[01:15:00.000 --> 01:15:02.000]   "Go find yourself a woman of harlotry."
[01:15:02.000 --> 01:15:04.000]   Her name was Gomer,
[01:15:04.000 --> 01:15:06.000]   and she was unfaithful,
[01:15:06.000 --> 01:15:09.000]   repeatedly unfaithful.
[01:15:09.000 --> 01:15:12.000]   Hosea was called to love her,
[01:15:12.000 --> 01:15:14.000]   and yet she would continue
[01:15:14.000 --> 01:15:16.000]   to give herself away.
[01:15:16.000 --> 01:15:17.000]   And they had children,
[01:15:17.000 --> 01:15:18.000]   and amongst the children,
[01:15:18.000 --> 01:15:19.000]   one of the names of the children
[01:15:19.000 --> 01:15:20.000]   was Lo-Ramah,
[01:15:20.000 --> 01:15:21.000]   which means,
[01:15:21.000 --> 01:15:24.000]   "You are not My people."
[01:15:24.000 --> 01:15:25.000]   But by the incredible mercy of God,
[01:15:25.000 --> 01:15:27.000]   He displayed,
[01:15:27.000 --> 01:15:30.000]   "I have the choice
[01:15:30.000 --> 01:15:33.000]   to be so counterintuitive,
[01:15:33.000 --> 01:15:36.000]   counter logic, you could say,
[01:15:36.000 --> 01:15:38.000]   counter to what makes sense to you.
[01:15:38.000 --> 01:15:42.000]   Why would I ever show faithfulness
[01:15:42.000 --> 01:15:44.000]   to a bride who's so unfaithful?
[01:15:44.000 --> 01:15:48.000]   Because it's My choice."
[01:15:48.000 --> 01:15:51.000]   Does that not move us?
[01:15:51.000 --> 01:15:53.000]   Does this passage not scream, like,
[01:15:53.000 --> 01:15:55.000]   "Whoa!
[01:15:55.000 --> 01:15:59.000]   Our salvation is beyond comprehension."
[01:15:59.000 --> 01:16:00.000]   And He says,
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:02.000]   "According to His will,
[01:16:02.000 --> 01:16:04.000]   He has desired that, yes,
[01:16:04.000 --> 01:16:05.000]   although I could make you
[01:16:05.000 --> 01:16:07.000]   an object of wrath,"
[01:16:07.000 --> 01:16:09.000]   I want you to think about this,
[01:16:09.000 --> 01:16:10.000]   "we may complain,
[01:16:10.000 --> 01:16:11.000]   'Wait a minute,
[01:16:11.000 --> 01:16:12.000]   it seems so twisted.
[01:16:12.000 --> 01:16:15.000]   If you knew that I was going to suffer,
[01:16:15.000 --> 01:16:16.000]   are you trying to tell me
[01:16:16.000 --> 01:16:18.000]   that before I was even born,
[01:16:18.000 --> 01:16:20.000]   you were going to inflict me with harm,
[01:16:20.000 --> 01:16:21.000]   that I was going to experience
[01:16:21.000 --> 01:16:22.000]   suffering in this life?
[01:16:22.000 --> 01:16:24.000]   Maybe I'd even have a deformity,
[01:16:24.000 --> 01:16:25.000]   a deficiency?
[01:16:25.000 --> 01:16:27.000]   I was going to have hardships in my life?
[01:16:27.000 --> 01:16:30.000]   I would endure pains
[01:16:30.000 --> 01:16:32.000]   just so that I could be
[01:16:32.000 --> 01:16:34.000]   an object of your mercy?'
[01:16:34.000 --> 01:16:38.000]   The answer is, 'Yes!'
[01:16:38.000 --> 01:16:41.000]   That's to God's glory,
[01:16:41.000 --> 01:16:44.000]   and it's to your love and grace."
[01:16:44.000 --> 01:16:45.000]   God could have made
[01:16:45.000 --> 01:16:47.000]   every single one of us clay,
[01:16:47.000 --> 01:16:49.000]   clay targets for destruction.
[01:16:49.000 --> 01:16:50.000]   If God was a shooting man,
[01:16:50.000 --> 01:16:51.000]   He could say,
[01:16:51.000 --> 01:16:53.000]   "I'm going to shoot you into the sky,
[01:16:53.000 --> 01:16:54.000]   and I will show you glory
[01:16:54.000 --> 01:16:55.000]   of how good my aim is
[01:16:55.000 --> 01:16:58.000]   by killing all of you.
[01:16:58.000 --> 01:17:02.000]   Why do I have to choose any of you?"
[01:17:02.000 --> 01:17:03.000]   Because He says,
[01:17:03.000 --> 01:17:07.000]   "I could have vessels of destruction
[01:17:07.000 --> 01:17:10.000]   to show you the power of my wrath,
[01:17:10.000 --> 01:17:12.000]   and in an instant,
[01:17:12.000 --> 01:17:15.000]   every single clay target in the sky,
[01:17:15.000 --> 01:17:18.000]   every single clay on earth,
[01:17:18.000 --> 01:17:22.000]   will be destroyed by my precise wrath."
[01:17:22.000 --> 01:17:24.000]   And He says, "No,
[01:17:24.000 --> 01:17:26.000]   but that's not my heart.
[01:17:26.000 --> 01:17:28.000]   That's the point."
[01:17:28.000 --> 01:17:31.000]   He says, "I look upon you with pity.
[01:17:31.000 --> 01:17:33.000]   I move with compassion.
[01:17:33.000 --> 01:17:36.000]   I love you from the beginning to the end.
[01:17:36.000 --> 01:17:37.000]   I am your author
[01:17:37.000 --> 01:17:41.000]   and the perfecter of your faith.
[01:17:41.000 --> 01:17:43.000]   Some of you wrestle
[01:17:43.000 --> 01:17:45.000]   with the assurance of salvation.
[01:17:45.000 --> 01:17:49.000]   No, with full certainty,
[01:17:49.000 --> 01:17:51.000]   God's love is so great,
[01:17:51.000 --> 01:17:54.000]   grand, and beyond comprehension,
[01:17:54.000 --> 01:17:57.000]   that when He places His mercy upon you,
[01:17:57.000 --> 01:18:00.000]   He places everything upon you,
[01:18:00.000 --> 01:18:01.000]   and you will not lose it.
[01:18:01.000 --> 01:18:03.000]   Why?
[01:18:03.000 --> 01:18:06.000]   Because it wasn't your choice to begin with.
[01:18:06.000 --> 01:18:11.000]   It was for His glory.
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:12.000]   The mercy He's shown you
[01:18:12.000 --> 01:18:14.000]   was for His glory.
[01:18:14.000 --> 01:18:16.000]   You will not lose it,
[01:18:16.000 --> 01:18:19.000]   because God will never lose His glory,
[01:18:19.000 --> 01:18:21.000]   and you have been to your privilege
[01:18:21.000 --> 01:18:25.000]   now the object of the glory of God.
[01:18:25.000 --> 01:18:28.000]   You're a vessel of His mercy."
[01:18:28.000 --> 01:18:31.000]   I wanted us today just to experience
[01:18:31.000 --> 01:18:36.000]   a fresh appreciation for our salvation,
[01:18:36.000 --> 01:18:38.000]   that from the beginning portions
[01:18:38.000 --> 01:18:39.000]   to the middle portions
[01:18:39.000 --> 01:18:40.000]   and the end portions,
[01:18:40.000 --> 01:18:43.000]   God has ordained all of it.
[01:18:43.000 --> 01:18:44.000]   And yes, you will suffer,
[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:45.000]   and it will make you,
[01:18:45.000 --> 01:18:46.000]   with your human eyes, be like,
[01:18:46.000 --> 01:18:48.000]   "I don't see it. I don't get it.
[01:18:48.000 --> 01:18:50.000]   What is He doing?"
[01:18:50.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   But I want you to remember,
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:52.000]   with our human eyes,
[01:18:52.000 --> 01:18:55.000]   we look on Jesus, He's just a man.
[01:18:55.000 --> 01:18:56.000]   He grew up. He matured.
[01:18:56.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   He was a teen, then He was an adult,
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:18:58.000]   then He was a rabbi,
[01:18:58.000 --> 01:18:59.000]   and everybody said,
[01:18:59.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   "Come see the rabbi."
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:04.000]   But God, through His mercy, told you,
[01:19:04.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   "That's my Son.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:08.000]   There's glory in Him."
[01:19:08.000 --> 01:19:10.000]   And by mercy, we said,
[01:19:10.000 --> 01:19:13.000]   "Praise the Lord, the Son of God."
[01:19:13.000 --> 01:19:14.000]   The disciples of Christ--
[01:19:14.000 --> 01:19:15.000]   Pastor Peter has been talking
[01:19:15.000 --> 01:19:17.000]   about the disciples,
[01:19:17.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   and again, intentionally so,
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:21.000]   Christ chose the lowly,
[01:19:21.000 --> 01:19:26.000]   the unsuspecting, for His glory.
[01:19:26.000 --> 01:19:27.000]   And the disciples said,
[01:19:27.000 --> 01:19:29.000]   "Come see the miracle worker."
[01:19:29.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   And Jesus, by His mercy,
[01:19:30.000 --> 01:19:31.000]   revealed to them,
[01:19:31.000 --> 01:19:33.000]   "Poof! You think you chose me?
[01:19:33.000 --> 01:19:36.000]   I chose you."
[01:19:36.000 --> 01:19:38.000]   And then to us,
[01:19:38.000 --> 01:19:40.000]   it looks like, "I have to strive.
[01:19:40.000 --> 01:19:41.000]   I have to work.
[01:19:41.000 --> 01:19:43.000]   I have to choose this day.
[01:19:43.000 --> 01:19:44.000]   I have to labor.
[01:19:44.000 --> 01:19:45.000]   I have to repent,
[01:19:45.000 --> 01:19:48.000]   and I have to exercise my faith."
[01:19:48.000 --> 01:19:51.000]   True.
[01:19:51.000 --> 01:19:54.000]   God says, "Your faith is secure
[01:19:54.000 --> 01:19:56.000]   because I am the perfecter
[01:19:56.000 --> 01:20:00.000]   of your faith."
[01:20:00.000 --> 01:20:03.000]   Don't try for your own sense
[01:20:03.000 --> 01:20:06.000]   of nobility or any sense of identity
[01:20:06.000 --> 01:20:09.000]   or any sense of your value
[01:20:09.000 --> 01:20:13.000]   to hang on to your own agency
[01:20:13.000 --> 01:20:14.000]   because the beginning place
[01:20:14.000 --> 01:20:17.000]   for every Christian is,
[01:20:17.000 --> 01:20:19.000]   "I am just an abject death
[01:20:19.000 --> 01:20:21.000]   before you.
[01:20:21.000 --> 01:20:22.000]   You have told me,
[01:20:22.000 --> 01:20:25.000]   if any part of this is up to me,
[01:20:25.000 --> 01:20:28.000]   no man seeks God, not even one."
[01:20:28.000 --> 01:20:30.000]   Romans 3.
[01:20:30.000 --> 01:20:31.000]   "You have told me,
[01:20:31.000 --> 01:20:33.000]   we're dead in our transgressions.
[01:20:33.000 --> 01:20:34.000]   We're objects of wrath.
[01:20:34.000 --> 01:20:36.000]   Thanks be to God."
[01:20:36.000 --> 01:20:38.000]   When you rescue,
[01:20:38.000 --> 01:20:41.000]   you rescue fully.
[01:20:41.000 --> 01:20:42.000]   When you heal,
[01:20:42.000 --> 01:20:45.000]   you feel fully.
[01:20:45.000 --> 01:20:46.000]   And when you save,
[01:20:46.000 --> 01:20:48.000]   you save to perfection.
[01:20:48.000 --> 01:20:49.000]   And in this way,
[01:20:49.000 --> 01:20:50.000]   what we have is a unique,
[01:20:50.000 --> 01:20:53.000]   exclusive privilege
[01:20:53.000 --> 01:20:54.000]   that has been given to us
[01:20:54.000 --> 01:20:57.000]   by the mercies and compassions of God,
[01:20:57.000 --> 01:20:59.000]   and it includes every part of salvation.
[01:20:59.000 --> 01:21:01.000]   Amen?
[01:21:01.000 --> 01:21:03.000]   Let's glorify God by remembering,
[01:21:03.000 --> 01:21:05.000]   as it says in Ephesians 1,
[01:21:05.000 --> 01:21:07.000]   verse 4 through 9,
[01:21:07.000 --> 01:21:09.000]   "Just as he chose us in him
[01:21:09.000 --> 01:21:11.000]   before the foundation of the world,
[01:21:11.000 --> 01:21:13.000]   that we would be holy and blameless
[01:21:13.000 --> 01:21:15.000]   before him,
[01:21:15.000 --> 01:21:16.000]   in love he predestined us
[01:21:16.000 --> 01:21:17.000]   to adoption as sons
[01:21:17.000 --> 01:21:19.000]   through Jesus Christ to himself,
[01:21:19.000 --> 01:21:23.000]   according to the kind intention of his will,
[01:21:23.000 --> 01:21:28.000]   to the praise of the glory of his grace."
[01:21:28.000 --> 01:21:31.000]   You and I are vessels.
[01:21:31.000 --> 01:21:34.000]   God created us to be recipients,
[01:21:34.000 --> 01:21:36.000]   and we can do none other than to say,
[01:21:36.000 --> 01:21:40.000]   "Thank you, thank you, thank you."
[01:21:40.000 --> 01:21:44.000]   We want to be filled with the mercies of God
[01:21:44.000 --> 01:21:45.000]   so that when we understand
[01:21:45.000 --> 01:21:46.000]   his grand election,
[01:21:46.000 --> 01:21:47.000]   we're not thinking,
[01:21:47.000 --> 01:21:49.000]   "Oh yeah, do you believe in election?
[01:21:49.000 --> 01:21:51.000]   What? How dare you?"
[01:21:51.000 --> 01:21:53.000]   Or, "What? How dare you not?"
[01:21:53.000 --> 01:21:54.000]   And then it becomes a theological point
[01:21:54.000 --> 01:21:55.000]   of argumentation.
[01:21:55.000 --> 01:21:58.000]   No.
[01:21:58.000 --> 01:21:59.000]   It becomes for us
[01:21:59.000 --> 01:22:02.000]   this great, great joyous occasion to say,
[01:22:02.000 --> 01:22:03.000]   "Praise the Lord.
[01:22:03.000 --> 01:22:04.000]   I'm not bragging about,
[01:22:04.000 --> 01:22:06.000]   'I got into college.
[01:22:06.000 --> 01:22:07.000]   I got into Harvard.
[01:22:07.000 --> 01:22:09.000]   I got into X, Y, and Z
[01:22:09.000 --> 01:22:11.000]   profession, school, institution.'"
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:13.000]   No.
[01:22:13.000 --> 01:22:16.000]   I got mercied.
[01:22:16.000 --> 01:22:17.000]   And this is the balance
[01:22:17.000 --> 01:22:19.000]   that Apostle Paul knew.
[01:22:19.000 --> 01:22:21.000]   In 1 Timothy chapter 1,
[01:22:21.000 --> 01:22:23.000]   verse 15 through 16,
[01:22:23.000 --> 01:22:25.000]   Apostle Paul resoundingly says,
[01:22:25.000 --> 01:22:27.000]   "You have no idea
[01:22:27.000 --> 01:22:31.000]   how much I got mercied."
[01:22:31.000 --> 01:22:33.000]   He says in 1 Timothy 1, 15,
[01:22:33.000 --> 01:22:35.000]   it is a trustworthy statement,
[01:22:35.000 --> 01:22:37.000]   deserving full acceptance
[01:22:37.000 --> 01:22:39.000]   and appreciation
[01:22:39.000 --> 01:22:41.000]   that Christ Jesus came into the world
[01:22:41.000 --> 01:22:44.000]   to save sinners,
[01:22:44.000 --> 01:22:47.000]   among whom I am the foremost of all.
[01:22:47.000 --> 01:22:48.000]   Yet for this reason,
[01:22:48.000 --> 01:22:50.000]   I found mercy
[01:22:50.000 --> 01:22:51.000]   so that in me,
[01:22:51.000 --> 01:22:52.000]   as the foremost Jesus Christ,
[01:22:52.000 --> 01:22:53.000]   might demonstrate
[01:22:53.000 --> 01:22:55.000]   his perfect patience
[01:22:55.000 --> 01:22:56.000]   as an example for those
[01:22:56.000 --> 01:22:58.000]   who would believe in him
[01:22:58.000 --> 01:22:59.000]   for eternal life.
[01:22:59.000 --> 01:23:05.000]   Let's pray.
[01:23:05.000 --> 01:23:07.000]   Heavenly Father,
[01:23:07.000 --> 01:23:09.000]   our gracious Lord,
[01:23:09.000 --> 01:23:12.000]   we thank you.
[01:23:12.000 --> 01:23:15.000]   We thank you so much, God,
[01:23:15.000 --> 01:23:18.000]   that you do not leave us in the dark
[01:23:18.000 --> 01:23:20.000]   and we're left to wonder,
[01:23:20.000 --> 01:23:21.000]   truly are we secure
[01:23:21.000 --> 01:23:23.000]   when the world rages,
[01:23:23.000 --> 01:23:25.000]   when the reprobate and pagans,
[01:23:25.000 --> 01:23:28.000]   the wicked generation is thriving,
[01:23:28.000 --> 01:23:31.000]   when we feel like the minority?

[01:27:45.000 --> 01:27:49.000]   Our God, we are refreshed today to remember
[01:27:49.000 --> 01:27:51.000]   that you are sovereign in salvation,
[01:27:51.000 --> 01:27:53.000]   and we again thank you
[01:27:53.000 --> 01:27:55.000]   that then you freely gave it to us.
[01:27:55.000 --> 01:27:59.000]   Lord, we know that to us it costs us nothing,
[01:27:59.000 --> 01:28:02.000]   but to you it costs everything, including your Son.
[01:28:02.000 --> 01:28:04.000]   So we thank you.
[01:28:04.000 --> 01:28:07.000]   We also know that as we're reminded of your sovereignty,
[01:28:07.000 --> 01:28:11.000]   Lord, when we go forth to preach the gospel
[01:28:11.000 --> 01:28:14.000]   and to speak of the mercy you receive,
[01:28:14.000 --> 01:28:17.000]   we know, God, that it will bear its fruit.
[01:28:17.000 --> 01:28:19.000]   And so, God, as we know that even here and abroad
[01:28:19.000 --> 01:28:21.000]   there are those who are yours,
[01:28:21.000 --> 01:28:23.000]   we pray that we could see
[01:28:23.000 --> 01:28:26.000]   your wondrous and sovereign work be done.

[01:28:28.000 --> 01:28:30.000]   we pray that you would divinely appoint them
[01:28:30.000 --> 01:28:32.000]   to be able to speak and proclaim
[01:28:32.000 --> 01:28:35.000]   of the mercies and the grace of Christ,
[01:28:35.000 --> 01:28:38.000]   and, God, that you would bring the lost to yourself.
[01:28:38.000 --> 01:28:40.000]   And even here, Lord, would you use us
[01:28:40.000 --> 01:28:42.000]   as a mighty beacon of light,
[01:28:42.000 --> 01:28:45.000]   that, God, we would share in the love of Christ.
