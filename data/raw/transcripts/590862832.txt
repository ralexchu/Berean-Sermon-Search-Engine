[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.640]   Good morning, everybody.
[00:00:07.640 --> 00:00:13.960]   As most of you know, summer is almost over, and midweek Bible studies resume in about
[00:00:13.960 --> 00:00:15.800]   a week.
[00:00:15.800 --> 00:00:19.760]   From September to December, our entire church, including the youth and all the way down to
[00:00:19.760 --> 00:00:25.360]   the children's ministry, will be doing an inductive Bible study through Paul's epistle
[00:00:25.360 --> 00:00:27.040]   to Titus.
[00:00:27.040 --> 00:00:31.680]   So in the book of Titus, we're going to find instructions on how to do church, what to
[00:00:31.680 --> 00:00:37.200]   expect of church leadership, how to combat false teachers and false teachings.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:43.200]   We will learn God's blueprint for building strong churches that are effective in evangelism.
[00:00:43.200 --> 00:00:46.740]   And we will learn about how Christians are to conduct themselves in the pagan world that
[00:00:46.740 --> 00:00:48.400]   surrounds them.
[00:00:48.400 --> 00:00:53.400]   So Titus has a lot to say about how we're going to engage the world around us.
[00:00:53.400 --> 00:00:58.040]   And I know that many of you are excited to dive into the study.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:02.080]   And the sermon today will serve in some ways as an introduction to the series and to the
[00:01:02.080 --> 00:01:03.280]   book.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:06.480]   And hopefully it whets your appetite for more.
[00:01:06.480 --> 00:01:10.160]   I'm going to start by reading the first five verses of Titus for you, and then we're going
[00:01:10.160 --> 00:01:14.720]   to ask the Lord really to speak this morning to our hearts.
[00:01:14.720 --> 00:01:17.760]   Titus 1, 1 through 5.
[00:01:17.760 --> 00:01:23.880]   "Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen
[00:01:23.880 --> 00:01:28.940]   of God and the knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness.
[00:01:28.940 --> 00:01:34.680]   In the hope of eternal life, which God who cannot lie promised long ages ago, but at
[00:01:34.680 --> 00:01:40.720]   the proper time manifested, even his word, in the proclamation with which I was entrusted
[00:01:40.720 --> 00:01:44.240]   according to the commandment of God our Savior.
[00:01:44.240 --> 00:01:50.240]   To Titus, my true child in a common faith, grace and peace from God the Father, in Christ
[00:01:50.240 --> 00:01:52.680]   Jesus our Savior.
[00:01:52.680 --> 00:01:58.120]   For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint
[00:01:58.120 --> 00:02:02.080]   elders in every city as I directed you."
[00:02:02.080 --> 00:02:05.520]   Let's pray together.
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:18.600]   Lord, we are very thankful just that you give us a freedom to worship, to hear your truths,
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:24.520]   and by your grace would you allow us to respond appropriately this morning, to have our souls
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:32.720]   fed that we would be filled with joy, that we would be filled with power, that we would
[00:02:32.720 --> 00:02:38.400]   know how best to display the reflection of your glory to the world that is lost around
[00:02:38.400 --> 00:02:40.680]   us.
[00:02:40.680 --> 00:02:46.520]   Would you hide your servant behind this pulpit and would you speak and minister to your sheep?
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.160]   We thank you for this time.
[00:02:49.160 --> 00:02:54.040]   We ask for your blessing and we pray these things in Jesus' name.
[00:02:54.040 --> 00:02:58.320]   Up to about 15 years ago, when the majority of our church members were still in their
[00:02:58.320 --> 00:03:03.000]   early 20s, we had about one wedding a year.
[00:03:03.000 --> 00:03:06.800]   And it was a big deal, not just for the couple, but for the entire church.
[00:03:06.800 --> 00:03:12.620]   So every engagement was announced and the wedding was an all-church event.
[00:03:12.620 --> 00:03:17.280]   If there was a church member's wedding in any particular month, that bridal shower,
[00:03:17.280 --> 00:03:23.600]   the bachelor party, the rehearsal, and obviously the wedding were all included into the church
[00:03:23.600 --> 00:03:25.880]   schedule, into the church calendar.
[00:03:25.880 --> 00:03:30.040]   And if you were a Berean, you didn't need an invite.
[00:03:30.040 --> 00:03:33.420]   You just assumed you were invited.
[00:03:33.420 --> 00:03:39.680]   And it was also assumed that you would stick around after the wedding to help clean up.
[00:03:39.680 --> 00:03:44.680]   And obviously those days are long gone and far behind us and we are no longer at that
[00:03:44.680 --> 00:03:47.300]   stage in our church.
[00:03:47.300 --> 00:03:50.640]   Now we have lots of weddings going on throughout the year.
[00:03:50.640 --> 00:03:54.840]   All four of the pastors were at a wedding just yesterday.
[00:03:54.840 --> 00:04:00.960]   In the five-week stretch from October 16th to November 13th, in those five weeks, we
[00:04:00.960 --> 00:04:06.600]   have six Berean weddings scheduled and every single weekend, at least one of our pastors
[00:04:06.600 --> 00:04:09.880]   will be officiating a wedding somewhere.
[00:04:09.880 --> 00:04:11.540]   Six weddings in five weeks.
[00:04:11.540 --> 00:04:16.680]   So at present, we have a bunch of engaged couples and lots of pre-marital counseling
[00:04:16.680 --> 00:04:18.840]   sessions going on.
[00:04:18.840 --> 00:04:21.920]   Many of you in this room have been engaged.
[00:04:21.920 --> 00:04:27.280]   So you know that the engagement period can be a strange and challenging one.
[00:04:27.280 --> 00:04:31.920]   There's a degree of struggle and tension as a couple prepares for a life of oneness, but
[00:04:31.920 --> 00:04:35.740]   they still need to function as two separate individuals.
[00:04:35.740 --> 00:04:40.360]   The couple is growing in knowledge of each other as a future life partner, but they're
[00:04:40.360 --> 00:04:42.820]   still not technically married.
[00:04:42.820 --> 00:04:48.080]   They want so badly to be fully together, but for all intents and purposes, there is still
[00:04:48.080 --> 00:04:51.680]   much need to do things separately.
[00:04:51.680 --> 00:04:55.420]   So the engagement period is not easy, but it is important.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:56.420]   It's necessary.
[00:04:56.420 --> 00:05:00.040]   And there are things to be planned and prepared during the engagement, and there is work to
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:01.720]   be done.
[00:05:01.720 --> 00:05:04.460]   A wedding needs to be planned.
[00:05:04.460 --> 00:05:10.540]   And if you skip the engagement, no one's going to come to your party, your wedding, if you're
[00:05:10.540 --> 00:05:13.320]   even going to have a wedding at all.
[00:05:13.320 --> 00:05:19.320]   And there's one thing that all engaged couples have in common, and it's this.
[00:05:19.320 --> 00:05:23.600]   They want the engagement to end.
[00:05:23.600 --> 00:05:25.680]   They want it done.
[00:05:25.680 --> 00:05:28.120]   They don't want to plan a wedding anymore.
[00:05:28.120 --> 00:05:30.600]   They just want to be married.
[00:05:30.600 --> 00:05:36.040]   I haven't met a single person who wants to stay engaged forever.
[00:05:36.040 --> 00:05:39.960]   The Christian life on this side of eternity is very similar to an engagement.
[00:05:39.960 --> 00:05:46.240]   A pledge has been made, but it has not yet been actualized or consummated.
[00:05:46.240 --> 00:05:51.680]   We now belong to the Lord, but are not quite yet with the Lord.
[00:05:51.680 --> 00:05:57.160]   We have access to the bridegroom, and we are called to grow in the knowledge of him.
[00:05:57.160 --> 00:06:01.100]   But for now, this knowledge is in part, and not yet in full.
[00:06:01.100 --> 00:06:06.080]   So just as there is an already-but-not-yet tension in an engagement period, the same
[00:06:06.080 --> 00:06:09.000]   is true of the Christian life.
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:15.820]   I've been memorizing through Titus and chewing on the book of Titus for the last few months.
[00:06:15.820 --> 00:06:21.080]   And the more I recite this book in my head, the more I meditate on these verses, the more
[00:06:21.080 --> 00:06:27.240]   my mind keeps picturing an engaged couple preparing for a wedding.
[00:06:27.240 --> 00:06:32.540]   I see many guiding principles in the book of Titus that parallel a Christian engagement.
[00:06:32.540 --> 00:06:38.320]   The central figure in the book of Titus is the bridegroom, Christ Jesus, and the church
[00:06:38.320 --> 00:06:42.400]   looks forward to the coming of the bridegroom.
[00:06:42.400 --> 00:06:49.120]   And the church faithfully stewards this engagement period in which she finds herself.
[00:06:49.120 --> 00:06:53.720]   There are instructions detailing how she is to conduct herself while she waits.
[00:06:53.720 --> 00:06:56.600]   And that is the heartbeat of Titus.
[00:06:56.600 --> 00:07:01.760]   So for a legitimate few seconds, I actually was contemplating naming our Bible study series
[00:07:01.760 --> 00:07:04.160]   Rules of Engagement.
[00:07:04.160 --> 00:07:08.040]   But I just ended up with the more conservative life in the Father's house, so you guys wouldn't
[00:07:08.040 --> 00:07:10.940]   be shocked or freaked out or confused.
[00:07:10.940 --> 00:07:16.460]   But keep this engagement imagery in mind, and hopefully you too will come to observe
[00:07:16.460 --> 00:07:19.200]   and appreciate the similarities.
[00:07:19.200 --> 00:07:22.800]   So I read the first five verses of Titus a few moments ago, and the sermon today will
[00:07:22.800 --> 00:07:25.560]   be a preview to the study.
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:28.960]   And today's sermon outline is as follows.
[00:07:28.960 --> 00:07:33.920]   First I'm going to start with the premise of the letter, chapters 1, verses 2 and 3.
[00:07:33.920 --> 00:07:34.920]   Okay?
[00:07:34.920 --> 00:07:39.120]   Chapter 1, verse 2 and 3, it's the premise.
[00:07:39.120 --> 00:07:43.140]   And then we're going to be looking at the practice of the letter, how it's meant to
[00:07:43.140 --> 00:07:45.720]   be applied.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:50.480]   And then I'm going to backtrack, and in verse 1 we're going to look at the purpose of the
[00:07:50.480 --> 00:07:51.580]   letter.
[00:07:51.580 --> 00:07:54.320]   The premise, practice, and purpose.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:07:57.340]   And now I'm guessing that the order of this outline is already rubbing some of you the
[00:07:57.340 --> 00:07:58.340]   wrong way.
[00:07:58.340 --> 00:08:01.780]   Some of you guys were more anal, because I'm doing the 1 at the end.
[00:08:01.780 --> 00:08:06.820]   And in your inductive study, the order of the points is going to be different.
[00:08:06.820 --> 00:08:10.140]   If I were teaching this as a Bible study, the order would be different.
[00:08:10.140 --> 00:08:11.140]   Okay?
[00:08:11.140 --> 00:08:16.100]   But because I'll be spending the bulk of my time on verse 1 this morning, this is how
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:17.100]   I've organized it.
[00:08:17.100 --> 00:08:21.220]   So hopefully this will make more sense as we move through the text and the message.
[00:08:21.220 --> 00:08:27.220]   The premise of the epistle to Titus, the practice of the epistle to Titus, and then we're going
[00:08:27.220 --> 00:08:28.580]   to be talking about the purpose.
[00:08:28.580 --> 00:08:29.580]   Okay?
[00:08:29.580 --> 00:08:34.520]   So the premise of the letter, verses 2 and 3, verse 2 starts grammatically mid-sentence.
[00:08:34.520 --> 00:08:38.060]   So in order to avoid further aggravating you, I'm going to just read from verse 1.
[00:08:38.060 --> 00:08:39.060]   All right?
[00:08:39.060 --> 00:08:41.820]   So let me read the three opening verses again for you.
[00:08:41.820 --> 00:08:47.140]   "Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith of those chosen
[00:08:47.140 --> 00:08:52.060]   to God and the knowledge of the truth, which is according to godliness, in the hope of
[00:08:52.060 --> 00:08:58.940]   eternal life, which God, who cannot lie, promised long ages ago, but at the proper time manifested
[00:08:58.940 --> 00:09:03.960]   even his word in the proclamation with which I was entrusted, according to the commandment
[00:09:03.960 --> 00:09:08.580]   of God our Savior, in the hope of eternal life."
[00:09:08.580 --> 00:09:13.860]   So here in the opening verses, the apostle Paul says that he has been preaching because
[00:09:13.860 --> 00:09:16.180]   there's a future hope.
[00:09:16.180 --> 00:09:19.700]   He's been commanded to preach because of this future hope.
[00:09:19.700 --> 00:09:26.600]   The bridegroom will return and that those chosen of God will be betrothed to him forever.
[00:09:26.600 --> 00:09:28.940]   And this is guaranteed.
[00:09:28.940 --> 00:09:33.840]   God has promised this and God always makes good on his promises.
[00:09:33.840 --> 00:09:39.060]   So when I proposed to my wife Becky about 15 and a half years ago, I wrote a song and
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:41.020]   I proposed to her in the song.
[00:09:41.020 --> 00:09:46.660]   And I'm going to read a very, very cheesy line for you in this dumb song.
[00:09:46.660 --> 00:09:47.660]   Okay?
[00:09:47.660 --> 00:09:51.380]   "I'll make all your dreams come true.
[00:09:51.380 --> 00:09:55.780]   I'll cook, clean, do the dishes, and diapers too."
[00:09:55.780 --> 00:09:57.380]   That was a line.
[00:09:57.380 --> 00:09:58.380]   Okay?
[00:09:58.380 --> 00:10:01.380]   And I set myself up for failure.
[00:10:01.380 --> 00:10:05.640]   So when you go, you know, when guys go down on a knee and do their little speech before
[00:10:05.640 --> 00:10:09.820]   their proposal, we say all kinds of stuff.
[00:10:09.820 --> 00:10:15.020]   And we say fluffy things and make all kinds of lofty promises and we are doing our best
[00:10:15.020 --> 00:10:22.320]   to be sincere, but some of the stuff we say doesn't quite work out.
[00:10:22.320 --> 00:10:27.200]   Human promises are all too often broken, even with the best of intentions.
[00:10:27.200 --> 00:10:31.120]   And human engagements can be broken.
[00:10:31.120 --> 00:10:39.600]   But when God makes a pledge or a promise, he speaks absolute and certain truth.
[00:10:39.600 --> 00:10:42.440]   So he makes good on what he says.
[00:10:42.440 --> 00:10:43.720]   He always has.
[00:10:43.720 --> 00:10:45.460]   He always will.
[00:10:45.460 --> 00:10:52.920]   He is all-powerful and he cannot and does not lie.
[00:10:52.920 --> 00:10:55.800]   When he says, he does.
[00:10:55.800 --> 00:10:59.760]   So Ephesians 1, 13 to 14 says that we were sealed in him with the Holy Spirit of promise
[00:10:59.760 --> 00:11:03.880]   and he is a pledge, a guarantee of our inheritance.
[00:11:03.880 --> 00:11:07.160]   So eternal life awaits.
[00:11:07.160 --> 00:11:10.200]   Eternal life is guaranteed.
[00:11:10.200 --> 00:11:12.440]   And what is eternal life?
[00:11:12.440 --> 00:11:18.560]   The Bible defines it as an eternity spent growing in intimate knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:18.560 --> 00:11:27.320]   If your picture of eternity has no Jesus, chances are you don't have the Spirit of God
[00:11:27.320 --> 00:11:30.080]   leading your heart.
[00:11:30.080 --> 00:11:36.320]   Eternal life is focused on a growing intimate knowledge of Jesus Christ.
[00:11:36.320 --> 00:11:43.680]   John 17, 3 reads, "This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God
[00:11:43.680 --> 00:11:46.560]   and Jesus Christ whom you have sent."
[00:11:46.560 --> 00:11:50.480]   So I met my wife, Becky, in 1999.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.200]   We started dating in 2003.
[00:11:53.200 --> 00:11:55.120]   We got married in 2007.
[00:11:55.120 --> 00:11:58.400]   So we became husband and wife in 2007.
[00:11:58.400 --> 00:12:03.680]   But our relationship began long before that.
[00:12:03.680 --> 00:12:08.360]   Eternal life does not begin when your heart stops beating and you physically expire.
[00:12:08.360 --> 00:12:12.880]   For the Christian, it starts at the moment when God opens the eyes of an unbeliever,
[00:12:12.880 --> 00:12:16.520]   changes his heart of stone into a heart of flesh, and the person puts his faith in the
[00:12:16.520 --> 00:12:18.400]   saving work of Christ.
[00:12:18.400 --> 00:12:21.440]   And there is a growing love.
[00:12:21.440 --> 00:12:27.360]   There is a promise of a betrothal, and an eternal relationship has begun.
[00:12:27.360 --> 00:12:30.760]   So eternal life is knowing God.
[00:12:30.760 --> 00:12:35.640]   And this knowledge of God begins on this side of the heavenly wedding feast.
[00:12:35.640 --> 00:12:41.080]   So eternal life for you and me has already begun.
[00:12:41.080 --> 00:12:45.800]   And for fuller context, I'm going to read verses 17, or chapter 17, verses 1 through
[00:12:45.800 --> 00:12:46.800]   4.
[00:12:46.800 --> 00:12:52.440]   "Jesus spoke these things, and lifting up his eyes to heaven, he said, 'Father, the
[00:12:52.440 --> 00:12:54.840]   hour has come.
[00:12:54.840 --> 00:12:59.080]   Glorify your Son that the Son may glorify you.
[00:12:59.080 --> 00:13:03.760]   Even as you gave him authority over all flesh, that to all whom you have given him he may
[00:13:03.760 --> 00:13:06.280]   give eternal life.
[00:13:06.280 --> 00:13:10.960]   This is eternal life, that they may know you, the only true God, and Jesus Christ whom you
[00:13:10.960 --> 00:13:12.880]   have sent.
[00:13:12.880 --> 00:13:19.860]   I glorify you on the earth, having accomplished the work which you have given me to do.'"
[00:13:19.860 --> 00:13:22.320]   This is the last recorded prayer.
[00:13:22.320 --> 00:13:26.480]   Jesus prays before his trial and eventual crucifixion.
[00:13:26.480 --> 00:13:31.380]   So what was that work, past tense, that Jesus accomplished on the earth?
[00:13:31.380 --> 00:13:37.860]   It was to give sinful man access to holy God through the cross.
[00:13:37.860 --> 00:13:43.780]   So the earth and this life on earth still remains in judgment.
[00:13:43.780 --> 00:13:45.580]   It is still corrupted.
[00:13:45.580 --> 00:13:51.820]   It still stands condemned, but access to the knowledge of God has now been granted and
[00:13:51.820 --> 00:13:57.340]   initiated and the bride of Christ now waits with eager expectation for the bridegroom's
[00:13:57.340 --> 00:13:58.720]   return.
[00:13:58.720 --> 00:14:02.300]   So eternal life is already, but not yet.
[00:14:02.300 --> 00:14:06.420]   The engagement ceremony is past.
[00:14:06.420 --> 00:14:11.040]   But the wedding for the bride of Christ is still future.
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:14.020]   So what are the contents of Titus founded upon?
[00:14:14.020 --> 00:14:16.700]   What is the premise of the book of Titus?
[00:14:16.700 --> 00:14:17.700]   J.P.
[00:14:17.700 --> 00:14:25.460]   Green writes, "Confident expectation based on the promise of the unlying God."
[00:14:25.460 --> 00:14:32.280]   There's going to be a wedding, y'all, is what he's saying, is guaranteed.
[00:14:32.280 --> 00:14:36.620]   So the church is now eagerly waiting for the great wedding feast.
[00:14:36.620 --> 00:14:42.560]   And if you want a description of this wedding feast, look at Revelation 19.
[00:14:42.560 --> 00:14:47.860]   But for now, at present, the church is in this already, but not yet engagement, tension,
[00:14:47.860 --> 00:14:50.020]   and struggle.
[00:14:50.020 --> 00:14:53.540]   But while she waits, she has work to do.
[00:14:53.540 --> 00:14:56.000]   So the promise is the premise.
[00:14:56.000 --> 00:15:01.400]   The promise of eternal life is the premise on which this church exists.
[00:15:01.400 --> 00:15:06.100]   The promise of eternal life is the premise on which Paul is commanded to preach.
[00:15:06.100 --> 00:15:12.340]   And the promise is the premise for which Titus finds himself in Crete.
[00:15:12.340 --> 00:15:15.100]   So which brings us to our second point.
[00:15:15.100 --> 00:15:18.900]   The premise is the promise, okay?
[00:15:18.900 --> 00:15:23.380]   So here is the expected practice of the letter.
[00:15:23.380 --> 00:15:24.380]   The practice of the letter.
[00:15:24.380 --> 00:15:27.620]   So what was Paul's expectation of Titus?
[00:15:27.620 --> 00:15:29.660]   What were his expectations of the churches in Crete?
[00:15:29.660 --> 00:15:33.060]   And what are the Lord's expectations of a church like ours?
[00:15:33.060 --> 00:15:38.140]   Okay, I'm going to read verses four and five again for you.
[00:15:38.140 --> 00:15:43.780]   To Titus, my true child in a common faith, grace and peace from God the Father and Christ
[00:15:43.780 --> 00:15:46.380]   Jesus our Savior.
[00:15:46.380 --> 00:15:52.560]   For this reason I left you in Crete, that you would set in order what remains and appoint
[00:15:52.560 --> 00:15:55.740]   elders in every city as I directed you.
[00:15:55.740 --> 00:16:01.180]   So for this reason, okay, Paul left Titus in Crete.
[00:16:01.180 --> 00:16:04.500]   There is an expected application.
[00:16:04.500 --> 00:16:10.540]   The this and for this reason is the premise that we just looked at in verses two and three.
[00:16:10.540 --> 00:16:15.620]   The practice begins in verse five and continues throughout the rest of the letter with very
[00:16:15.620 --> 00:16:21.200]   specific instructions for the church, the bride of Christ.
[00:16:21.200 --> 00:16:25.500]   So the all-important engagement period has been initiated.
[00:16:25.500 --> 00:16:27.420]   There will be a wedding feast.
[00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.300]   All are invited.
[00:16:29.300 --> 00:16:33.500]   Proper wedding garments have been supplied already by the bridegroom.
[00:16:33.500 --> 00:16:40.140]   And a seat at the table is guaranteed for all who are dressed in those garments.
[00:16:40.140 --> 00:16:45.340]   So what is this bride to do while she waits?
[00:16:45.340 --> 00:16:47.980]   Beautify herself.
[00:16:47.980 --> 00:16:50.660]   We are to build up the church.
[00:16:50.660 --> 00:16:52.820]   That's the practice.
[00:16:52.820 --> 00:17:00.400]   So Titus was to do his best to build the church in the way God would want it built.
[00:17:00.400 --> 00:17:04.380]   And the specifics we'll see in the rest of the letter.
[00:17:04.380 --> 00:17:07.740]   God's way of doing life in God's church.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:10.780]   Leaders leading the way God would have them lead.
[00:17:10.780 --> 00:17:16.300]   Older men in the church conducting themselves in ways that are appropriate.
[00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:20.180]   Younger men and women behaving properly in God's church.
[00:17:20.180 --> 00:17:25.420]   Non-slaves being exemplary in God's church.
[00:17:25.420 --> 00:17:28.260]   What to drive out of God's church.
[00:17:28.260 --> 00:17:31.920]   What to defend God's church from.
[00:17:31.920 --> 00:17:38.120]   And how God's church is to interact with the outside pagan world.
[00:17:38.120 --> 00:17:41.580]   So the church of God is very important.
[00:17:41.580 --> 00:17:45.320]   It's the primary vehicle through which the invitations to the kingdom of God are going
[00:17:45.320 --> 00:17:47.540]   to go out.
[00:17:47.540 --> 00:17:51.920]   It's the means through which disciples of Jesus will be made and grown.
[00:17:51.920 --> 00:17:58.340]   And the building of God's church was the priority for Jesus' early followers.
[00:17:58.340 --> 00:18:03.180]   So if you guys think through how did the early apostles, how did the apostles, what did they
[00:18:03.180 --> 00:18:04.180]   engage in?
[00:18:04.180 --> 00:18:08.880]   Did the 12 of them make 12 disciples and instruct them to make 12 disciples more in some kind
[00:18:08.880 --> 00:18:11.020]   of like multi-level pyramid strategy?
[00:18:11.020 --> 00:18:12.020]   No.
[00:18:12.020 --> 00:18:17.780]   They all folked, they went all in on the church.
[00:18:17.780 --> 00:18:19.540]   They built churches.
[00:18:19.540 --> 00:18:21.780]   They poured all their energies into the churches.
[00:18:21.780 --> 00:18:22.780]   Why?
[00:18:22.780 --> 00:18:28.420]   First Timothy 3.15, the latter part reads, "I write so that you will know how one ought
[00:18:28.420 --> 00:18:33.740]   to conduct himself in the household of God, which is the church of the living God, the
[00:18:33.740 --> 00:18:37.460]   pillar and support of the truth."
[00:18:37.460 --> 00:18:41.260]   So the church of the living God is the pillar and support of the truth.
[00:18:41.260 --> 00:18:44.820]   The ESV translate this buttress.
[00:18:44.820 --> 00:18:48.300]   The King James translates it like ground.
[00:18:48.300 --> 00:18:52.820]   The dynamic translations like the NIV will call it a foundation.
[00:18:52.820 --> 00:18:56.600]   So the church is the pillar and foundation of the truth.
[00:18:56.600 --> 00:19:03.300]   It's the platform through which the truth of God is magnified and displayed.
[00:19:03.300 --> 00:19:08.840]   And because the church of God is going to be on full display for the world, what she
[00:19:08.840 --> 00:19:18.180]   puts on display needs to be reflective of the bridegroom to whom she is pledged.
[00:19:18.180 --> 00:19:24.620]   And the two things that are being put on display are one, the teaching of the church, and two,
[00:19:24.620 --> 00:19:27.060]   the deeds of the church.
[00:19:27.060 --> 00:19:28.380]   Teaching and deeds.
[00:19:28.380 --> 00:19:32.980]   Paul had similar instructions for Timothy, that he was to watch his doctrine and his
[00:19:32.980 --> 00:19:34.840]   life closely.
[00:19:34.840 --> 00:19:37.220]   Teaching and deeds.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:44.580]   So in Titus 1 through 5 and following, Paul starts with instructions for church leaders,
[00:19:44.580 --> 00:19:49.100]   for elders, and that's how you get those little sections of qualifications.
[00:19:49.100 --> 00:19:54.660]   The elders of the church are to be at the very front, modeling correct teaching and
[00:19:54.660 --> 00:19:59.280]   correct behavior for the rest of the church to see.
[00:19:59.280 --> 00:20:04.520]   So verse 9 of Titus 1 emphasizes that the leaders of the church need to hold fast the
[00:20:04.520 --> 00:20:08.380]   faithful word which is in accordance with the teaching.
[00:20:08.380 --> 00:20:13.880]   So church leaders need to make sure that their doctrine is sound, that they are teaching
[00:20:13.880 --> 00:20:16.060]   accurately.
[00:20:16.060 --> 00:20:24.820]   And as an aside, and that's why our church stresses expository verse-by-verse preaching.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:31.000]   The culture around us doesn't tell us what we preach and teach.
[00:20:31.000 --> 00:20:38.820]   The affairs of the world, national crises, don't dictate what we teach and preach.
[00:20:38.820 --> 00:20:43.900]   The scriptures dictate what we preach and teach, and because God's word is living and
[00:20:43.900 --> 00:20:50.180]   active, when we preach accurately from the scriptures, the spirit of God will go forth
[00:20:50.180 --> 00:20:56.180]   from this pulpit and instruct and feed and guide his people into all truth, we read in
[00:20:56.180 --> 00:20:57.980]   John 16, 13.
[00:20:57.980 --> 00:21:01.240]   And his word will not return void.
[00:21:01.240 --> 00:21:07.200]   So teaching is the first important practice for the church while she awaits the bridegroom's
[00:21:07.200 --> 00:21:08.880]   return.
[00:21:08.880 --> 00:21:12.320]   And through that teaching, the invitations come.
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:19.160]   The second practice involves the church's deeds, her good works.
[00:21:19.160 --> 00:21:24.400]   The apostle Paul writes at length to Titus about the importance of the deeds of the church
[00:21:24.400 --> 00:21:26.240]   and her members.
[00:21:26.240 --> 00:21:30.020]   So this is emphasized again and again.
[00:21:30.020 --> 00:21:34.780]   Godliness is to be measurable.
[00:21:34.780 --> 00:21:36.940]   Godliness is to be measurable.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:45.500]   The doctrine of God in and of itself is beautiful, but it needs to be adorned, cosmeo, by the
[00:21:45.500 --> 00:21:46.500]   members of the church.
[00:21:46.500 --> 00:21:53.300]   And we get the word cosmetic from this word cosmeo, to adorn.
[00:21:53.300 --> 00:21:59.380]   A beautiful woman without makeup, she's still beautiful.
[00:21:59.380 --> 00:22:02.580]   I guess, follow me?
[00:22:02.580 --> 00:22:03.580]   Okay.
[00:22:03.580 --> 00:22:11.020]   But when you apply the proper cosmetics on an already beautiful woman, she becomes next
[00:22:11.020 --> 00:22:16.140]   level radiant and she catches the eye of everybody.
[00:22:16.140 --> 00:22:21.280]   So the doctrines of God are beautiful in and of themselves, but how much more radiant would
[00:22:21.280 --> 00:22:26.420]   they be when the church adorns itself with godly deeds?
[00:22:26.420 --> 00:22:32.380]   So the church, Titus is hearing, needs to be characterized by good deeds.
[00:22:32.380 --> 00:22:33.940]   Why?
[00:22:33.940 --> 00:22:37.820]   Because the church is on display for all the world to see.
[00:22:37.820 --> 00:22:41.980]   The church's faith must lead to visible good works.
[00:22:41.980 --> 00:22:47.100]   Good deeds or good works, if you're using the ESV, are repeated again and again and
[00:22:47.100 --> 00:22:48.460]   again and again in Titus.
[00:22:48.460 --> 00:22:51.000]   And I just compiled a list for you here.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:55.880]   116, by their deeds they deny him, worthless for any good deed.
[00:22:55.880 --> 00:22:58.320]   27, example of good deeds.
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:01.000]   214, redeem us from every lawless deed.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.080]   214, a people zealous for good deeds.
[00:23:04.080 --> 00:23:07.440]   311, be ready for every good deed.
[00:23:07.440 --> 00:23:10.520]   315, he saved us not on the basis of deeds.
[00:23:10.520 --> 00:23:13.720]   318, careful to engage in good deeds.
[00:23:13.720 --> 00:23:18.440]   314, at the end of the letter, just in case Titus didn't catch it, Paul writes it again.
[00:23:18.440 --> 00:23:25.360]   Our people must also learn to engage in good deeds.
[00:23:25.360 --> 00:23:28.640]   You know what happens when church members are properly adorning themselves and accurately
[00:23:28.640 --> 00:23:31.600]   displaying the glory of God?
[00:23:31.600 --> 00:23:34.560]   Opponents are put to shame.
[00:23:34.560 --> 00:23:40.560]   Blaspheming and ridiculing mouths are silenced.
[00:23:40.560 --> 00:23:45.520]   All they can say is, "You guys are weird."
[00:23:45.520 --> 00:23:55.560]   Titus 2.7.8, "In all things, show yourself to be an example of good deeds, with purity
[00:23:55.560 --> 00:24:03.360]   in doctrine, dignified, sound in speech which is beyond reproach, so that the opponent will
[00:24:03.360 --> 00:24:08.300]   be put to shame, having nothing bad to say about us."
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:12.340]   So over the next three months, we will be diving into a deep study of how God would
[00:24:12.340 --> 00:24:15.080]   have us build this church.
[00:24:15.080 --> 00:24:19.600]   And may this study produce in our church many good deeds for his glory.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:20.920]   Amen?
[00:24:20.920 --> 00:24:24.800]   So we looked at the premise of the letter, the promise.
[00:24:24.800 --> 00:24:26.060]   That was the premise.
[00:24:26.060 --> 00:24:31.800]   We noted the practice or application of this premise is to focus, go all in on the building
[00:24:31.800 --> 00:24:35.440]   up of his church.
[00:24:35.440 --> 00:24:39.280]   What is the purpose of the letter?
[00:24:39.280 --> 00:24:44.080]   And we'll see it in the opening verse, the greeting and introduction to Titus.
[00:24:44.080 --> 00:24:50.320]   Verse one, "Paul, a bondservant of God and an apostle of Jesus Christ, for the faith
[00:24:50.320 --> 00:24:57.680]   of those chosen of God and the knowledge of the truth which is according to godliness."
[00:24:57.680 --> 00:25:04.200]   I hear something that I hope you will see when we study through the epistle to Titus.
[00:25:04.200 --> 00:25:12.520]   Building the church God's way is not humanly possible.
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:16.640]   Building the church God's way is not humanly possible.
[00:25:16.640 --> 00:25:20.120]   So if you were writing down an application, "Okay, I need to focus on building the church,"
[00:25:20.120 --> 00:25:23.080]   it's not done through human effort.
[00:25:23.080 --> 00:25:28.020]   So you and I in our own strength cannot build his church.
[00:25:28.020 --> 00:25:35.960]   You and I, no matter how eager we are or how devoted we are, cannot beautify or cosmeo
[00:25:35.960 --> 00:25:39.560]   ourselves through human effort.
[00:25:39.560 --> 00:25:46.960]   So good deeds or good works does not come from our determination or our planning.
[00:25:46.960 --> 00:25:51.320]   Resolutions do not produce good deeds.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:57.840]   Human strategy, human ability, human ingenuity, clever management of the church, studly leaders,
[00:25:57.840 --> 00:26:08.200]   just wealthy members, skilled people are not enough to build a God-honoring church.
[00:26:08.200 --> 00:26:11.600]   And this is touched upon from the very opening of the letter.
[00:26:11.600 --> 00:26:14.840]   First, God is the one who is doing the choosing.
[00:26:14.840 --> 00:26:16.120]   Okay, so you see that?
[00:26:16.120 --> 00:26:18.760]   The faith of those chosen of God.
[00:26:18.760 --> 00:26:25.760]   Second, godliness also comes from something outside of human effort, something beyond
[00:26:25.760 --> 00:26:29.040]   the determination of man.
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:36.000]   So the Greek preposition kata, it's translated "for."
[00:26:36.000 --> 00:26:40.640]   In the English word "for," it can mean all kinds of different things, okay?
[00:26:40.640 --> 00:26:45.000]   But the "for" usually indicates purpose.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:46.960]   And it appears twice in this opening verse.
[00:26:46.960 --> 00:26:51.940]   And at both times, kata is followed by accusative singular feminine nouns, okay?
[00:26:51.940 --> 00:26:54.520]   So they're direct objects.
[00:26:54.520 --> 00:26:59.140]   So faith, kata faith, and kata godliness.
[00:26:59.140 --> 00:27:03.920]   So Paul is writing this letter to Titus to primarily address and encourage, one, the
[00:27:03.920 --> 00:27:09.280]   faith of the elect of God, and two, the godliness of the elect.
[00:27:09.280 --> 00:27:12.320]   That's the purpose of the letter.
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.400]   But verse one is a little tricky.
[00:27:14.400 --> 00:27:16.380]   It's a little difficult to translate.
[00:27:16.380 --> 00:27:20.840]   And that's why if you do a comparison of different translations, the rendering of the verses
[00:27:20.840 --> 00:27:22.760]   differ slightly.
[00:27:22.760 --> 00:27:30.640]   And the biggest question here is, what is the relationship of the knowledge of the truth
[00:27:30.640 --> 00:27:33.480]   to godliness?
[00:27:33.480 --> 00:27:38.840]   If we're supposed to be known by good deeds, godliness is measurable, then what's this
[00:27:38.840 --> 00:27:46.920]   relationship with knowledge as it relates to godliness?
[00:27:46.920 --> 00:27:48.760]   So that's a very important question.
[00:27:48.760 --> 00:27:53.880]   Does a knowledge of the truth lead to godliness, as NIV seems to suggest?
[00:27:53.880 --> 00:27:56.280]   Is godliness a measuring stick for truth?
[00:27:56.280 --> 00:27:57.280]   Can it be both?
[00:27:57.280 --> 00:27:58.900]   Is it both?
[00:27:58.900 --> 00:28:01.600]   Does godliness lead to greater understanding of truth?
[00:28:01.600 --> 00:28:05.080]   Because sometimes when I'm in a sin, I kind of forget things.
[00:28:05.080 --> 00:28:07.940]   When I'm ungodly, the truth is blurred.
[00:28:07.940 --> 00:28:12.880]   But when I am being more godly, does that mean the truth is highlighted in my life?
[00:28:12.880 --> 00:28:15.920]   That's an important question you're going to wrestle with in about a week and a half.
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:17.420]   And after that, it becomes easy.
[00:28:17.420 --> 00:28:19.600]   The next 45 verses aren't as bad.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:20.600]   They're more clear-cut.
[00:28:20.600 --> 00:28:22.620]   So here's a forewarning.
[00:28:22.620 --> 00:28:26.920]   If you start with it and verse one is really difficult, it gets better.
[00:28:26.920 --> 00:28:27.920]   So just don't quit.
[00:28:27.920 --> 00:28:28.920]   All right?
[00:28:28.920 --> 00:28:32.840]   So here's the point throughout the flow of the whole letter.
[00:28:32.840 --> 00:28:37.160]   Right belief and right behavior are inseparable.
[00:28:37.160 --> 00:28:39.240]   You are what you know, okay?
[00:28:39.240 --> 00:28:43.160]   Right belief and right behavior are inseparable.
[00:28:43.160 --> 00:28:50.560]   My understanding of the opening of this passage is that truly right belief leads to right
[00:28:50.560 --> 00:28:53.040]   behavior.
[00:28:53.040 --> 00:28:57.320]   Right behavior is evidence of your right belief.
[00:28:57.320 --> 00:29:02.080]   If you have knowledge of God but your life is not consistent with your knowledge, you
[00:29:02.080 --> 00:29:07.920]   prove that you actually don't have knowledge, that you are a buffoon, and that you are in
[00:29:07.920 --> 00:29:11.080]   denial and rebellion toward God.
[00:29:11.080 --> 00:29:18.740]   Titus 1:16, "They profess to know God, but by their deeds they deny him, being detestable
[00:29:18.740 --> 00:29:23.220]   and disobedient and worthless for any good deed."
[00:29:23.220 --> 00:29:28.920]   So right belief and right behavior are inseparable.
[00:29:28.920 --> 00:29:38.240]   And in Titus, you find people of the circumcision and you find lazy gluttons in Crete, okay?
[00:29:38.240 --> 00:29:44.600]   They all profess to know God, but they have no idea what it is that they're professing.
[00:29:44.600 --> 00:29:49.440]   They're professing to be wise, but they are fools.
[00:29:49.440 --> 00:29:56.160]   Romans 1:22 says something very similar, "Professing to be wise, they became fools."
[00:29:56.160 --> 00:30:04.100]   So the Bible makes it clear that genuine knowledge of the truth always produces godliness.
[00:30:04.100 --> 00:30:12.720]   So this begs an important question, what then is the knowledge of the truth?
[00:30:12.720 --> 00:30:19.380]   The godly deeds are expected from me, from the church, and there's a relationship between
[00:30:19.380 --> 00:30:22.120]   godly deeds and knowledge of the truth.
[00:30:22.120 --> 00:30:24.540]   I need some more of that.
[00:30:24.540 --> 00:30:26.200]   How do I apply this?
[00:30:26.200 --> 00:30:28.660]   So what is knowledge of the truth?
[00:30:28.660 --> 00:30:32.960]   And that is a very important question, and I'm going to start with some things that are
[00:30:32.960 --> 00:30:37.540]   mistaken for the knowledge of the truth, okay?
[00:30:37.540 --> 00:30:44.180]   First one is having correct or extensive theological proficiency.
[00:30:44.180 --> 00:30:48.500]   Having correct or extensive theological proficiency.
[00:30:48.500 --> 00:30:54.900]   You can be well-read in your theology and still not know God, and still not know the
[00:30:54.900 --> 00:30:56.820]   truth.
[00:30:56.820 --> 00:31:04.820]   You can be a biblical scholar and still not know the truth.
[00:31:04.820 --> 00:31:09.620]   Being raised in Sunday school and being familiar with all the stories, is that knowledge of
[00:31:09.620 --> 00:31:11.300]   the truth?
[00:31:11.300 --> 00:31:15.760]   Being at church for three decades, four decades, five decades out of my life, we do church
[00:31:15.760 --> 00:31:21.140]   every Sunday, is that knowledge of the truth?
[00:31:21.140 --> 00:31:27.220]   As an aside, one of the problems of my generation is that many of us have only grown up on children's
[00:31:27.220 --> 00:31:29.180]   Bible theology.
[00:31:29.180 --> 00:31:31.020]   What is that?
[00:31:31.020 --> 00:31:37.620]   Where 40% of all my Christianity is Genesis, 50% of all my Christianity is Jesus' miracles
[00:31:37.620 --> 00:31:42.860]   and his road to the cross, and the 10% is Jonah, David, Samson, Goliath, and some Elijah
[00:31:42.860 --> 00:31:43.860]   and Elisha.
[00:31:43.860 --> 00:31:44.940]   That's my faith.
[00:31:44.940 --> 00:31:46.380]   One saved, always saved.
[00:31:46.380 --> 00:31:47.380]   Don't mess with me.
[00:31:47.380 --> 00:31:48.740]   My eternity is secure.
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:54.100]   That's children's Bible theology.
[00:31:54.100 --> 00:31:58.560]   Another thing that's often mistaken for the knowledge of the truth is having a strong
[00:31:58.560 --> 00:32:03.340]   moral compass or a tender conscience.
[00:32:03.340 --> 00:32:08.820]   You know that guy, every time he sees a poor person on the street, he gets teary.
[00:32:08.820 --> 00:32:10.420]   He's moved to compassion.
[00:32:10.420 --> 00:32:11.980]   He's moved to give.
[00:32:11.980 --> 00:32:13.700]   That guy has something that I don't have.
[00:32:13.700 --> 00:32:14.900]   Maybe he knows God.
[00:32:14.900 --> 00:32:18.520]   He's closer to God because he's so generous with people.
[00:32:18.520 --> 00:32:20.500]   This person never loses her temper.
[00:32:20.500 --> 00:32:22.600]   She's such a good listener.
[00:32:22.600 --> 00:32:29.560]   She is so nice when our pastor is very mean.
[00:32:29.560 --> 00:32:30.880]   Maybe she knows something.
[00:32:30.880 --> 00:32:33.540]   There's a knowledge of God in her.
[00:32:33.540 --> 00:32:38.180]   That's also sometimes mistaken as knowledge of the truth.
[00:32:38.180 --> 00:32:44.740]   Having a passion for strong Christian values is often mistaken for knowledge of the truth.
[00:32:44.740 --> 00:32:45.740]   Don't drink.
[00:32:45.740 --> 00:32:46.740]   Don't cuss.
[00:32:46.740 --> 00:32:47.740]   Don't gamble.
[00:32:47.740 --> 00:32:48.740]   Don't cheat.
[00:32:48.740 --> 00:32:49.740]   Don't watch inappropriate things.
[00:32:49.740 --> 00:32:50.740]   Don't do.
[00:32:50.740 --> 00:32:52.240]   Don't do.
[00:32:52.240 --> 00:32:57.220]   And I value those things.
[00:32:57.220 --> 00:33:00.780]   That's not knowledge of the truth.
[00:33:00.780 --> 00:33:08.900]   Being active in a church, being active in a Bible church does not equate to knowledge
[00:33:08.900 --> 00:33:10.540]   of the truth.
[00:33:10.540 --> 00:33:15.540]   And these are things that are often mistaken for knowledge of the truth.
[00:33:15.540 --> 00:33:19.180]   Knowledge of the truth will always lead to these things.
[00:33:19.180 --> 00:33:26.540]   Having better theology, having a tender, compassionate heart, being active in church, having strong
[00:33:26.540 --> 00:33:28.640]   Christian principles and values.
[00:33:28.640 --> 00:33:32.500]   Knowledge of the truth always leads to those things, but it's possible for the habitual
[00:33:32.500 --> 00:33:38.300]   church attender to have all of these things and have no knowledge of the truth.
[00:33:38.300 --> 00:33:43.100]   Knowing a lot about God is not the same as knowing God.
[00:33:43.100 --> 00:33:48.700]   Getting a dating app, finding a girl that seems attractive on paper, pursuing her just
[00:33:48.700 --> 00:33:56.500]   from that through text, engaging in an email is not a relationship.
[00:33:56.500 --> 00:33:59.740]   Knowing a lot about God is not the same as knowing God.
[00:33:59.740 --> 00:34:03.640]   I want to share with you a couple of Jesus' own definitions to describe what the knowledge
[00:34:03.640 --> 00:34:07.660]   of the truth entails.
[00:34:07.660 --> 00:34:15.660]   There's a belief, there's a discerning of the shepherd's voice, and a following.
[00:34:15.660 --> 00:34:18.580]   Okay, John 10, 26-28.
[00:34:18.580 --> 00:34:22.340]   There's a belief, a discerning of the shepherd's voice, and a following.
[00:34:22.340 --> 00:34:26.100]   You do not believe because you are not of my sheep.
[00:34:26.100 --> 00:34:31.960]   My sheep hear my voice, and I know them, and they follow me.
[00:34:31.960 --> 00:34:35.860]   And I give eternal life to them, and they will never perish.
[00:34:35.860 --> 00:34:39.140]   And no one will snatch them out of my hand.
[00:34:39.140 --> 00:34:42.980]   That's one aspect of it.
[00:34:42.980 --> 00:34:46.540]   Knowledge of the truth is also what sanctifies a believer of Christ.
[00:34:46.540 --> 00:34:50.180]   John 17, 17.
[00:34:50.180 --> 00:34:52.540]   Sanctify them in the truth.
[00:34:52.540 --> 00:34:56.180]   Your word is truth.
[00:34:56.180 --> 00:35:00.180]   So what is this?
[00:35:00.180 --> 00:35:04.980]   What does it mean to know the truth?
[00:35:04.980 --> 00:35:11.500]   This is my definition, an intimate and growing understanding of the heart of God through
[00:35:11.500 --> 00:35:16.080]   feeding from the word of God.
[00:35:16.080 --> 00:35:22.420]   An intimate and growing understanding of the heart of God through feeding from the
[00:35:22.420 --> 00:35:25.420]   word of God.
[00:35:25.420 --> 00:35:32.180]   And knowledge of the truth always leads to the godliness of the believer.
[00:35:32.180 --> 00:35:38.060]   So here are two questions that I want to throw at you.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:40.980]   Are you a godly person?
[00:35:40.980 --> 00:35:46.600]   And here's another question.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:50.040]   How do you become more godly?
[00:35:50.040 --> 00:35:51.040]   Morning prayer?
[00:35:51.040 --> 00:35:52.040]   Memorize Titus?
[00:35:52.040 --> 00:35:54.420]   How do you become more godly?
[00:35:54.420 --> 00:35:56.740]   Give money to the poor?
[00:35:56.740 --> 00:36:03.040]   Be patient with those who wrong you?
[00:36:03.040 --> 00:36:06.800]   I've been a Christian for 28 years now.
[00:36:06.800 --> 00:36:13.780]   This is my 21st year of pastoral ministry, and the older I get, the more I grow in pastoral
[00:36:13.780 --> 00:36:19.820]   ministry with each passing year of being a Christian.
[00:36:19.820 --> 00:36:29.780]   It's strange because the more inadequate, the more hypocritical, and the dirtier I feel.
[00:36:29.780 --> 00:36:37.420]   When I was a pastor in my 20s, I would tell myself and psych myself up, "Dude, you're
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:40.220]   God's gift to Christendom.
[00:36:40.220 --> 00:36:42.280]   Change the world for Jesus.
[00:36:42.280 --> 00:36:44.580]   You can do it.
[00:36:44.580 --> 00:36:49.260]   You can do all things through Christ who strengthens you.
[00:36:49.260 --> 00:36:54.500]   God needs you!" was what I thought.
[00:36:54.500 --> 00:37:00.060]   And then I hit my 30s, and I matured a little.
[00:37:00.060 --> 00:37:04.840]   It was, "Okay, accurately handle God's Word.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:08.220]   Be faithful to God's Word."
[00:37:08.220 --> 00:37:14.200]   But now I'm a few years into my 40s, and you know what my mantra is now?
[00:37:14.200 --> 00:37:19.040]   Don't do something so stupid and get disqualified from ministry.
[00:37:19.040 --> 00:37:24.340]   Don't be stupid and get disqualified from ministry.
[00:37:24.340 --> 00:37:33.380]   With each passing year, I'm becoming more increasingly aware of who I'm not.
[00:37:33.380 --> 00:37:38.340]   There is nothing good in me outside of Christ, and I'm becoming more and more aware of my
[00:37:38.340 --> 00:37:44.580]   hopelessness without the grace of God sustaining me day to day.
[00:37:44.580 --> 00:37:53.300]   There is so much in my heart that desires comfort, pleasure, glory.
[00:37:53.300 --> 00:38:01.500]   In my heart, there are areas of it that are still so fond of sin.
[00:38:01.500 --> 00:38:09.040]   And I, in my effort, always mess things up, and I taint everything.
[00:38:09.040 --> 00:38:14.820]   When I work hard for something spiritual and it goes well, you know who I want to give
[00:38:14.820 --> 00:38:16.540]   credit to?
[00:38:16.540 --> 00:38:22.960]   I can package it before you in a nice way, but when I do something spiritually well,
[00:38:22.960 --> 00:38:26.580]   I try to take the credit.
[00:38:26.580 --> 00:38:36.900]   If I teach or preach or lead well, I naturally attribute it to my preparation, my hard work,
[00:38:36.900 --> 00:38:40.760]   my skill.
[00:38:40.760 --> 00:38:49.340]   The harder I work, the more I corrupt, the more I taint, the more I just make things
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:52.940]   foul and dirty.
[00:38:52.940 --> 00:39:00.420]   So I'm discovering that my hard work has done nothing but to frustrate and only make me
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:06.280]   more outwardly religious.
[00:39:06.280 --> 00:39:13.820]   No amount of hard work has made me any godlier in the last 28 years as a Christian or 21
[00:39:13.820 --> 00:39:17.820]   years as a pastor.
[00:39:17.820 --> 00:39:23.100]   And I've realized something through the years.
[00:39:23.100 --> 00:39:30.620]   There's actually only one thing I can control, one thing I can pursue to become godlier and
[00:39:30.620 --> 00:39:38.300]   more Christ-like, repentance.
[00:39:38.300 --> 00:39:45.020]   You know, the more I study the scriptures, the ungodlier I feel.
[00:39:45.020 --> 00:39:50.860]   The more hypocritical I sound in my head as I preach.
[00:39:50.860 --> 00:39:55.380]   The more I study God's word, the more the blemishes and the blotches and the dirty things
[00:39:55.380 --> 00:39:58.540]   that I see.
[00:39:58.540 --> 00:40:06.140]   The more I study the scriptures, I'm reminded that not only do I not measure up, there's
[00:40:06.140 --> 00:40:14.220]   a lot still in me that just stands in outright rebellion toward the God of the universe.
[00:40:14.220 --> 00:40:23.660]   So the only thing that I can pursue and control really is not to resist when His word washes
[00:40:23.660 --> 00:40:32.420]   me, when His word purifies me, when His word cuts me and carves me up, not to resist and
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:37.060]   just surrender.
[00:40:37.060 --> 00:40:47.500]   I can't work any harder to become godlier, but I can stay exposing my heart before the
[00:40:47.500 --> 00:40:55.300]   word of God, and He sanctifies and purifies and washes me.
[00:40:55.300 --> 00:41:06.260]   And whenever the areas of sin are revealed, don't justify it, don't make excuses, just
[00:41:06.260 --> 00:41:11.820]   acknowledge, don't compare, and just repent.
[00:41:11.820 --> 00:41:20.260]   You know, the interesting thing is, is as I'm interacting with God's word and my heart
[00:41:20.260 --> 00:41:30.660]   is moved to repentance, I find myself to be a more zealous worshiper.
[00:41:30.660 --> 00:41:36.700]   As I'm sitting there humiliated and humbled, a few things happen.
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:42.480]   The grace of God, the cross of Christ, becomes that much more beautiful.
[00:41:42.480 --> 00:41:47.340]   The forgiveness and the patience of God becomes that much more sweet.
[00:41:47.340 --> 00:41:53.560]   The forest in my eyes get exposed, so when I see a little speck in someone else, I have
[00:41:53.560 --> 00:42:01.380]   compassion and love and patience.
[00:42:01.380 --> 00:42:08.740]   Repenting before the word, before the Lord, leads me to have a greater appreciation of
[00:42:08.740 --> 00:42:09.740]   my Savior.
[00:42:09.740 --> 00:42:12.660]   I grow more loving.
[00:42:12.660 --> 00:42:19.580]   You know, funny thing is, true biblical knowledge never leads to legalism.
[00:42:19.580 --> 00:42:22.940]   Does that make sense?
[00:42:22.940 --> 00:42:28.540]   True biblical knowledge never leads to legalism.
[00:42:28.540 --> 00:42:32.300]   Legalism comes from biblical illiteracy.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:36.100]   It's spiritual ignorance on fire.
[00:42:36.100 --> 00:42:45.020]   True biblical literacy, where you know the truth of God, will always bring forth terror,
[00:42:45.020 --> 00:42:48.500]   humility, and compassion.
[00:42:48.500 --> 00:42:55.060]   That always happens because the knowledge of the truth sanctifies and beautifies the
[00:42:55.060 --> 00:42:56.060]   believer.
[00:42:56.060 --> 00:42:59.700]   Godliness does not come from effort or hard work.
[00:42:59.700 --> 00:43:05.020]   It's the bridegroom who washes and sanctifies.
[00:43:05.020 --> 00:43:07.740]   You know, you and I are like sponges.
[00:43:07.740 --> 00:43:12.980]   Sponges, a lot of times, you look at it from the surface, it doesn't look dirty.
[00:43:12.980 --> 00:43:16.500]   But when you squeeze the thing, what happens?
[00:43:16.500 --> 00:43:22.960]   Sometimes, when I am squose, I'm shocked by what comes out.
[00:43:22.960 --> 00:43:28.780]   You put me in a circumstance and squeeze me, stuff comes out, and then I'm embarrassed,
[00:43:28.780 --> 00:43:32.020]   and I'm shocked.
[00:43:32.020 --> 00:43:35.740]   But how do you clean a sponge?
[00:43:35.740 --> 00:43:38.020]   You dunk it.
[00:43:38.020 --> 00:43:39.020]   Squeeze it.
[00:43:39.020 --> 00:43:46.140]   Dunk, squeeze, dunk, squeeze, dunk, squeeze, dunk, squeeze, until all that is left after.
[00:43:46.140 --> 00:43:52.180]   Left after every squeeze is clean water.
[00:43:52.180 --> 00:44:02.860]   Ephesians 5, 26 to 27, and this is often used at weddings, husbands love your wives.
[00:44:02.860 --> 00:44:11.020]   This is speaking of Jesus, "So that he might sanctify her, having cleansed her by the washing
[00:44:11.020 --> 00:44:21.340]   of water with the word, that he might present to himself the church in all her glory, having
[00:44:21.340 --> 00:44:29.580]   no spot or wrinkle or any such thing, that she would be holy and blameless."
[00:44:29.580 --> 00:44:33.900]   So godliness does not come through effort or hard work.
[00:44:33.900 --> 00:44:40.000]   It comes from an ever-increasing, intimate knowledge of the truth.
[00:44:40.000 --> 00:44:45.500]   It comes from being daily sanctified by the word of God.
[00:44:45.500 --> 00:44:50.260]   And that process always produces good deeds.
[00:44:50.260 --> 00:44:51.420]   Why?
[00:44:51.420 --> 00:44:59.300]   Because a bridegroom takes very seriously the purification of the church, the godliness
[00:44:59.300 --> 00:45:01.660]   of the believer.
[00:45:01.660 --> 00:45:07.720]   His word will not return void.
[00:45:07.720 --> 00:45:13.180]   The bridegroom takes responsibility for the purification of his bride, and as he purifies,
[00:45:13.180 --> 00:45:22.340]   he makes beautiful and godly, and he sets free from the bondage to slavery and to decay
[00:45:22.340 --> 00:45:23.980]   and to corruption.
[00:45:23.980 --> 00:45:27.860]   John 8, 32, "You will know the truth."
[00:45:27.860 --> 00:45:31.340]   And what does that do?
[00:45:31.340 --> 00:45:33.840]   It sets you free.
[00:45:33.840 --> 00:45:40.900]   So the premise of the letter to Titus is God made a promise, and he always delivers.
[00:45:40.900 --> 00:45:43.000]   Eternal life is already, but not yet.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:47.740]   So while we're waiting, there's things we need to do as a church.
[00:45:47.740 --> 00:45:52.020]   There's a wedding feast that's waiting ahead, and we just need to get the word out.
[00:45:52.020 --> 00:45:55.860]   That's the practice of the book of Titus.
[00:45:55.860 --> 00:46:04.360]   But the purpose of the letter to Titus is to emphasize the growth in the faith of the
[00:46:04.360 --> 00:46:09.640]   community, and the growth in the godliness, and the beautification of the bride of Christ
[00:46:09.640 --> 00:46:15.820]   during this already, but not yet.
[00:46:15.820 --> 00:46:21.360]   The premise was the promise, and because of this premise, we build a church.
[00:46:21.360 --> 00:46:26.280]   But the point of all of this is that we can only truly build a church God's way when he's
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:30.880]   the one who's doing the building in and through us.
[00:46:30.880 --> 00:46:32.680]   Amen?
[00:46:32.680 --> 00:46:39.880]   This church and this church's growth is not because of the efforts of the seven men who
[00:46:39.880 --> 00:46:43.280]   lead this church.
[00:46:43.280 --> 00:46:48.960]   His word, when it's honored, it grows the church.
[00:46:48.960 --> 00:46:54.960]   I'm going to leave you with my only application.
[00:46:54.960 --> 00:47:02.240]   Expose your heart to the word of God as often as you can.
[00:47:02.240 --> 00:47:10.600]   Expose your heart to the word of God as often as you can, and you're not going to like it.
[00:47:10.600 --> 00:47:14.480]   You're going to hate what you find.
[00:47:14.480 --> 00:47:18.440]   You're going to hate what you find in you so much more than what you hate in what you
[00:47:18.440 --> 00:47:20.960]   find in other people.
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:26.960]   But it's going to break you, and the only real response that you can give is repentance.
[00:47:26.960 --> 00:47:31.400]   But as you're repenting, your thankfulness grows.
[00:47:31.400 --> 00:47:37.040]   The purity of your praise goes up.
[00:47:37.040 --> 00:47:46.760]   And for some strange, mysterious reason, you can finally love and finally see people through
[00:47:46.760 --> 00:47:52.080]   the eyes of Christ, and you can be long-suffering.
[00:47:52.080 --> 00:47:54.560]   So expose your heart to his word as often as you can.
[00:47:54.560 --> 00:47:55.920]   Don't resist.
[00:47:55.920 --> 00:48:04.960]   Repent, and as he purifies you, observe the growth in godly deeds.
[00:48:04.960 --> 00:48:07.760]   Observe the fruit.
[00:48:07.760 --> 00:48:15.040]   Rejoice in these good fruits that come out and give glory to the God, and teach others
[00:48:15.040 --> 00:48:17.200]   to do the same.
[00:48:17.200 --> 00:48:21.000]   That's the only application.
[00:48:21.000 --> 00:48:25.620]   Get your hands, like, your dirty hands clean.
[00:48:25.620 --> 00:48:28.400]   Get broken before the Lord.
[00:48:28.400 --> 00:48:31.320]   And I'm going to leave you a nice little summary of everything we studied together this morning.
[00:48:31.320 --> 00:48:39.440]   It comes from Titus 2, 11 to 15.
[00:48:39.440 --> 00:48:47.680]   For the grace of God has appeared, bringing salvation to all men, instructing us to deny
[00:48:47.680 --> 00:48:53.880]   ungodliness and worldly desires, and to live sensibly, righteously, and godly in the present
[00:48:53.880 --> 00:49:01.000]   age, looking for the blessed hope and the appearing of the glory of our great God and
[00:49:01.000 --> 00:49:02.920]   Savior Christ Jesus.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:07.520]   We are looking forward to the wedding feast.
[00:49:07.520 --> 00:49:19.200]   Verse 14, this is the bridegroom, who gave himself for us to redeem us from every lawless
[00:49:19.200 --> 00:49:33.480]   deed and to purify for himself a people for his own possession, zealous for good deeds.
[00:49:33.480 --> 00:49:47.080]   These things speak, exhort, reprove with all authority, and let no one disregard you.
[00:49:47.080 --> 00:49:52.480]   I look forward to our study together, which starts in about a week and a half.
[00:49:52.480 --> 00:49:59.160]   And may the Lord bless us with an increase of the knowledge of the truth.
[00:49:59.160 --> 00:50:01.400]   Amen.
[00:50:01.400 --> 00:50:10.760]   May he make us more godly and broken and loving.
[00:50:10.760 --> 00:50:19.480]   So I'm hoping you guys are excited about the book of Titus and that we grow, just delight
[00:50:19.480 --> 00:50:22.440]   in his word more and more as a church.
[00:50:22.440 --> 00:50:31.960]   I'm going to give you a minute to pray as a praise team comes up.
[00:50:31.960 --> 00:50:38.680]   And I encourage you to just ask the Lord, "Lord, am I godly?
[00:50:38.680 --> 00:50:42.600]   Do I reflect your glory well?
[00:50:42.600 --> 00:50:46.400]   Help me to reflect it well."
[00:50:46.400 --> 00:50:52.320]   Pray and then the praise team is going to lead us in our closing praise.
