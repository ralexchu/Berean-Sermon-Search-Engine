[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000]   [no audio]
[00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   ... devotions. Okay? Alright, I'll make less.
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   [laughter]
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:15.000]   No, the homework, homework or, um, the devotions, I'll make more copy.
[00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   But the ones that you're filling out while we're going at it, like, a lot of you guys aren't using that.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000]   You're putting it into your cell phone or whatever you're using.
[00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:26.000]   Anyway, alright.
[00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:29.000]   Let me pray first and we'll start.
[00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for today.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000]   We thank you, Lord God, for constant reminders and
[00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000]   little blessings, Lord, that cause us to know
[00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:45.000]   that it is because you are watching over us, that you care for your people.
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   And as you express your love toward the nation of Israel,
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:00:53.000]   despite their weakness, despite their shortcomings,
[00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:57.000]   Lord, it's a constant reminder to us how faithful you are
[00:00:57.000 --> 00:01:01.000]   to your own promise, to your own glory, and as a result, how we benefit from it.
[00:01:01.000 --> 00:01:05.000]   We pray, Father God, that as we see and observe and study
[00:01:05.000 --> 00:01:09.000]   how you've dealt with the nation of Israel, and how you will ultimately
[00:01:09.000 --> 00:01:13.000]   deal with all your people, help us to find confidence in you,
[00:01:13.000 --> 00:01:17.000]   that we would give you true worship, that you would be our refuge,
[00:01:17.000 --> 00:01:21.000]   that you would be the one that we find our joy and our peace in.
[00:01:21.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   And so we ask for your grace this evening as we study your word,
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:29.000]   that all of these things would have its effect in our hearts. In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:29.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Okay, so as we're looking on chapter 42 and 43,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:37.000]   I'm sure you've noticed that God is going back and forth.
[00:01:37.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   His argument of him sending
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   the promised Messiah, obviously Christ, coming to save the nation of Israel.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   But then in between his promises, you'll notice that
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:53.000]   he's constantly reminding them that despite all the things that he's done,
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:57.000]   that they have a tendency to continue to strive or continue to drift away from God.
[00:01:57.000 --> 00:02:01.000]   And so, primary theme
[00:02:01.000 --> 00:02:05.000]   in chapter 42 and 43 is God's faithfulness and his redeeming grace.
[00:02:05.000 --> 00:02:09.000]   But again, it's always kind of in the context of
[00:02:09.000 --> 00:02:13.000]   reminding them what this grace is for, why they needed grace,
[00:02:13.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   and why God needed to redeem them. And again,
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:21.000]   I think it's important for us, whenever we talk about grace, whenever we forget
[00:02:21.000 --> 00:02:25.000]   that God's primary gift isn't a great job
[00:02:25.000 --> 00:02:29.000]   or health or safety or comfort, but God's greatest
[00:02:29.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   gift is redemption from our sins, our joy in our life
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:37.000]   just goes up and down based upon whatever our circumstances may be.
[00:02:37.000 --> 00:02:41.000]   Our joy is solidly grounded upon the fact that he saved us
[00:02:41.000 --> 00:02:45.000]   from our own sins. And so I think that's why over and over again
[00:02:45.000 --> 00:02:49.000]   his primary theme is Christ our Redeemer, but what did
[00:02:49.000 --> 00:02:53.000]   he redeem us from? Their false worship. They redeemed us from
[00:02:53.000 --> 00:02:57.000]   confidence in Egypt, in other things.
[00:02:57.000 --> 00:03:01.000]   You know, coming to him or being blind. Over and over again.
[00:03:01.000 --> 00:03:05.000]   So he kind of reminds us of that. So we'll go through this section
[00:03:05.000 --> 00:03:09.000]   again just as God is prophesying about his Messiah
[00:03:09.000 --> 00:03:13.000]   coming. I apologize for the small letter.
[00:03:13.000 --> 00:03:17.000]   I used a different format and on my computer it looked huge.
[00:03:17.000 --> 00:03:21.000]   Okay, but it's not coming. Can you see?
[00:03:21.000 --> 00:03:25.000]   No? Okay. Alright. It looked big on my computer.
[00:03:25.000 --> 00:03:29.000]   Alright. So, who is my servant? I think it's pretty
[00:03:29.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   obvious. The servant that he's referring to is Jesus, the Messiah.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   This whole section in chapter 42 is about the coming of the Messiah.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   If you remember we talked about that in chapter 1 through 39
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   that there was a lot of prophecies about Christ, but again the
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   primary theme is that Israel will understand why judgment
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   was coming upon them. Chapter 39 to chapter 40
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   there is a huge gap, maybe about 150 years. And during those 150
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:01.000]   years the Assyrians fall, the Babylonians come in, the
[00:04:01.000 --> 00:04:05.000]   Babylonians fall, and then the Persians have come in. And King Cyrus
[00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   gave them the permission to go back into Jerusalem and
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   to reestablish Israel. So all of that has happened between chapter 39
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   and chapter 40. And so chapter 40 to chapter 66
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   the primary theme is Jesus our Redeemer.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:25.000]   Now, it doesn't mean that--he doesn't talk about judgment. He still talks about judgment.
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   He will every once in a while revert back and remind the nation of Israel
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:33.000]   why the Babylonians came and why the judgment came. But again
[00:04:33.000 --> 00:04:37.000]   you'll see a greater prophecy in chapter 40 through 66
[00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:41.000]   about Jesus. So again, right off the bat we see
[00:04:41.000 --> 00:04:45.000]   in chapter 42 that His prophecy about His servant, Jesus
[00:04:45.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   is coming. So if you look at
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:53.000]   chapter 42 verse 1 it says, "My chosen in whom my soul delights, I have put
[00:04:53.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   my Spirit upon him." And the Spirit is--most of your Bibles
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:01.000]   is capitalized "S" right? Right? Look at
[00:05:01.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   verse 1 of chapter 42. It's capitalized
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:09.000]   meaning that the interpreters believe that it is talking about the Holy Spirit. Why
[00:05:09.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   does Jesus need to have the Holy Spirit be placed upon Him
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:17.000]   when He is the second person of the Trinity?
[00:05:17.000 --> 00:05:25.000]   If my servant is in reference to Jesus
[00:05:25.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   and He is Christ, the second person of the Trinity, everything
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   was created by Him and for Him, why does God say
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:37.000]   that I will place my Spirit upon Him?
[00:05:37.000 --> 00:05:41.000]   Because He's man. Right? 100% man.
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:45.000]   When does that happen in Jesus' life?
[00:05:45.000 --> 00:05:49.000]   At the baptism. He gets baptized, the Holy Spirit comes and descends upon Him.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   And again I think
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:57.000]   Dr. Proud, remember when he came here and he was talking about the life of Christ and he was
[00:05:57.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   preaching about the Gospel? How sometimes we kind of separate the life of
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   Jesus because He's God? We can't possibly do that. But Jesus said, remember
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:09.000]   when I leave you will do even greater things? How can His
[00:06:09.000 --> 00:06:13.000]   disciples do even greater things? He says because the Holy Spirit is coming. And
[00:06:13.000 --> 00:06:17.000]   instead of just being upon them, the Holy Spirit is going to be indwelling them.
[00:06:17.000 --> 00:06:21.000]   Right? And so everything that Jesus did, He did as a
[00:06:21.000 --> 00:06:25.000]   man who had the Spirit of God upon Him. Right?
[00:06:25.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   So everything He did was an example for all mankind. Not just like, oh look at
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   Jesus. That's why He suffers. That's why He cries. That's why He's tired.
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:37.000]   That's why He grieves. Because He put on humanity completely.
[00:06:37.000 --> 00:06:41.000]   He didn't just taste it. He didn't just kind of put on a mask.
[00:06:41.000 --> 00:06:45.000]   When He came and became a man, He became 100% man.
[00:06:45.000 --> 00:06:49.000]   So even in His weakness, He took on man's weakness.
[00:06:49.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   So that's why He says the Holy Spirit, He's going to send My
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   servant because He came at, even though He was the second person of the
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   Trinity, He came and put on the servant's body.
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:05.000]   Even the Son of Man did not come to be served but to serve and to give His life
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:09.000]   as a ransom for many. Right? And so it was a,
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:13.000]   He didn't just taste it. He completely became man.
[00:07:13.000 --> 00:07:17.000]   Right? Though Jesus was fully God, He came fully,
[00:07:17.000 --> 00:07:21.000]   became a full man, experienced all that man is able to experience.
[00:07:21.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   Okay? Just like we just talked about.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:29.000]   He will bring not just grace but also justice through His sacrifice.
[00:07:29.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   You notice how in the first section when He talks about Jesus coming,
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   He mentions three or four separate times in verse one, He will bring forth
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:41.000]   justice to the nations. Verse three, He will faithfully
[00:07:41.000 --> 00:07:45.000]   bring forth justice. Verse four, He will not grow faint or
[00:07:45.000 --> 00:07:49.000]   discouraged till He has established justice on earth. Okay?
[00:07:49.000 --> 00:07:53.000]   So if this is in reference to Jesus coming, we
[00:07:53.000 --> 00:07:57.000]   typically think of Jesus coming to bring salvation, redemption, grace, mercy,
[00:07:57.000 --> 00:08:01.000]   but here it's described as justice. Right? Why do you think it's
[00:08:01.000 --> 00:08:05.000]   described as justice?
[00:08:05.000 --> 00:08:09.000]   When's the last time you thought
[00:08:09.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   about the work of Christ as bringing justice?
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:17.000]   Because when we think of justice, we think of punishment. Right?
[00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   Judgment.
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:25.000]   Mm-hmm?
[00:08:25.000 --> 00:08:29.000]   [inaudible]
[00:08:29.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   [inaudible]
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:37.000]   So for us to be...if He's going to come
[00:08:37.000 --> 00:08:41.000]   and put us in His grace, then
[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:45.000]   punishment and justice come from Him. >>Right.
[00:08:45.000 --> 00:08:49.000]   I think we all know it, but we don't really
[00:08:49.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   think about it in that light until it's like we deliberately
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   meditate on that. That the cross is justice and
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   mercy all at the same time. And if you take one away, the other doesn't make any sense.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   But we tend to talk about it so much one-sidedly
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:09.000]   about the grace, about love, about forgiveness, that we forget that
[00:09:09.000 --> 00:09:13.000]   the whole purpose of the cross was to justify His wrath.
[00:09:13.000 --> 00:09:17.000]   Right? To propitiate His wrath. So, the reason
[00:09:17.000 --> 00:09:21.000]   why Jesus had to come was to compensate
[00:09:21.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   for what was broken. Right? The wrath that mankind rightfully
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   deserved, Jesus absorbed it upon Himself. So, He came. So,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   the fullest display of His justice was at the cross.
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:37.000]   Right? Because every judgment that God
[00:09:37.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   had placed upon mankind and nation was for their sins.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:45.000]   So, whatever, like even the flood that came and wiped
[00:09:45.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   out the earth, that was an expression of His wrath toward those people.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   They weren't paying for our sins. Only on the cross do you see
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   complete justice. Right? For all
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:01.000]   our sins, past, present, and future. And so, the wrath of God
[00:10:01.000 --> 00:10:05.000]   that is revealed on the cross is much greater than any wrath that we've seen
[00:10:05.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   up to that point. Right? So, when He says He's come to
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:13.000]   bring justice, I think that's why it's tied in. If you remember, if you're
[00:10:13.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   studying through chapter 42 and 43, and again, like in between
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:21.000]   His expression of His love and redemption, He reminds them,
[00:10:21.000 --> 00:10:25.000]   right, "Despite I did all of this, you didn't come to me.
[00:10:25.000 --> 00:10:29.000]   You gave me false worship. You kept on turning to idols, because that's what you are
[00:10:29.000 --> 00:10:33.000]   deserving of this justice. But God had mercy on you. Right? Because I love
[00:10:33.000 --> 00:10:37.000]   you." And so, it's mixed in back and forth, back and forth. Right?
[00:10:37.000 --> 00:10:41.000]   So, I think it's important for us that when we think about the cross, that we think we always
[00:10:41.000 --> 00:10:45.000]   remember both sides. That He absorbed that wrath. And that
[00:10:45.000 --> 00:10:49.000]   is just as important as us understanding that that's also
[00:10:49.000 --> 00:10:53.000]   expression of His grace. But it's both. Right? Because what happens when we
[00:10:53.000 --> 00:10:57.000]   forget that that's an expression of His wrath?
[00:10:57.000 --> 00:11:01.000]   Yeah, I mean,
[00:11:01.000 --> 00:11:05.000]   it could easily become cheap grace. Right? It could easily become
[00:11:05.000 --> 00:11:09.000]   kind of like a grandfather passing out candy. Like, "Oh, you know,
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:13.000]   we love you. Here's some candy to eat." Not realizing exactly what it is that He did.
[00:11:13.000 --> 00:11:17.000]   Remember, again, Dr. Harris, when he talked about when the earth went dark
[00:11:17.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   and God actually shows up, because He had
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   to place His wrath upon His Son. That scene that
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   we needed, we should have been in that darkness.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:33.000]   But it was an intimate scene between the Father and the Son. Because no one else
[00:11:33.000 --> 00:11:37.000]   could be in that when the covenant was being ratified, because the wrath was being absorbed by
[00:11:37.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   the Son. Right? So, without that aspect of it, grace isn't
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   amazing. It's just like, "Ah, somebody remembered my birthday,
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:49.000]   and somebody loves me." And it just becomes cheap. Right?
[00:11:49.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   And I think when we recognize what it is that we have in Christ, that's
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   a reasonable response. Like it says in Romans 12, 1. Right? Reasonable
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   response in view of the mercy that we have in Christ. Right?
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   He said,
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:09.000]   "When He carries this justice out," again, these are all linked together,
[00:12:09.000 --> 00:12:13.000]   "He will not cry out loud or lift up His voice," as also
[00:12:13.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   prophesied in Isaiah 53. So, what does that tell you? When He
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   carries out His justice, He's not crying out.
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   [pause]
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:29.000]   [inaudible]
[00:12:29.000 --> 00:12:33.000]   [inaudible]
[00:12:33.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   Right. It was voluntary. So, of course,
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:41.000]   He humanly cried out in agony. Right?
[00:12:41.000 --> 00:12:45.000]   [inaudible] "Why have you forsaken Me?" But when He says He didn't
[00:12:45.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   cry out, meaning that it was done voluntarily. He didn't try to fight and run
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:53.000]   away from it. He came and voluntarily laid down His life. Right?
[00:12:53.000 --> 00:12:57.000]   It's like Isaiah 53.7, "He was oppressed and He was afflicted, and yet
[00:12:57.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   He opened not His mouth, like a lamb that is led to the slaughter, and like
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   a sheep that is before its shearers is silent. So He opened not
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:09.000]   His mouth." Right? And that's exactly what was prophesied. He's going to bring about
[00:13:09.000 --> 00:13:13.000]   justice voluntarily, and He will do it willingly.
[00:13:13.000 --> 00:13:17.000]   [pause]
[00:13:17.000 --> 00:13:21.000]   So, what does a bruised reed represent, and why
[00:13:21.000 --> 00:13:25.000]   does God promise not to break it? Who's the bruised reed
[00:13:25.000 --> 00:13:29.000]   and the flickering wick? Who's that?
[00:13:29.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   Israelites, right? Israel, God's people,
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   in general. Right? What is a bruised reed?
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   I mean, there's a bruised reed
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:45.000]   right there. Can you see it? Can you see it?
[00:13:45.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   It's just basically grass that's dried up and broken.
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:53.000]   Absolutely useless. Right?
[00:13:53.000 --> 00:13:57.000]   You're good for nothing. And who would think twice about tearing that out
[00:13:57.000 --> 00:14:01.000]   and using it as fire? Right? A burning wick.
[00:14:01.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   Here's that little piece of wick, and there's oil in here, and the thing that burns out.
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:09.000]   This thing burns out. What is this good for? You can't tie shoelaces. You can't
[00:14:09.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   use it as a--what is this thing good for? Right? So He uses two
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:17.000]   objects that are completely trash.
[00:14:17.000 --> 00:14:21.000]   Absolutely worth nothing. There's nothing you can salvage from this, but trash.
[00:14:21.000 --> 00:14:25.000]   Throw it in to be burned and getting rid of. And He says--so He
[00:14:25.000 --> 00:14:29.000]   uses this imagery. A bruised reed and a burning wick.
[00:14:29.000 --> 00:14:33.000]   He will not--what did He say? He will not forsake.
[00:14:33.000 --> 00:14:37.000]   He's talking about His people. This is the state of mankind in their sin.
[00:14:37.000 --> 00:14:41.000]   This is the state of Israel in their sin.
[00:14:41.000 --> 00:14:45.000]   Absolutely useless. Good for nothing. It's like salt without its flavor.
[00:14:45.000 --> 00:14:49.000]   Good for nothing other than to be trampled on the ground. And He says
[00:14:49.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   Jesus is going to come. He's going to bring about justice. And He's going to do
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:57.000]   it voluntarily, even for the least
[00:14:57.000 --> 00:15:01.000]   and the worthless, which is all of us in our sins.
[00:15:01.000 --> 00:15:05.000]   [shuffling]
[00:15:05.000 --> 00:15:34.880]   Oh did I go too fast?
[00:15:34.880 --> 00:15:38.520]   Done?
[00:15:38.520 --> 00:15:55.920]   Use your camera, take a picture.
[00:15:55.920 --> 00:16:00.920]   You guys done?
[00:16:00.920 --> 00:16:03.880]   Okay.
[00:16:03.880 --> 00:16:06.960]   So who will be a light for the nations and open eyes to the blind?
[00:16:06.960 --> 00:16:08.440]   Verse 6 and 7.
[00:16:08.440 --> 00:16:09.440]   Right?
[00:16:09.440 --> 00:16:15.200]   So I am the Lord, I have called you in righteousness, I will take you by the hand and keep you,
[00:16:15.200 --> 00:16:19.960]   I will give you as a covenant for the people, a light for the nations, to open the eyes
[00:16:19.960 --> 00:16:23.520]   that are blind, to bring out the prisoners from the dungeon.
[00:16:23.520 --> 00:16:24.520]   Right?
[00:16:24.520 --> 00:16:32.880]   It says the Lord is described as a creator in verse 5, but in 6 and 7, He's the caretaker.
[00:16:32.880 --> 00:16:43.120]   So this, this servant, so imagine like, now we know who Jesus is, like we're on this side
[00:16:43.120 --> 00:16:47.520]   of the covenant, we know who He is, we know how He talked, we know what He ate, we know
[00:16:47.520 --> 00:16:53.840]   His humanity, but imagine for a Jew, right, who doesn't have a clear picture of who Jesus
[00:16:53.840 --> 00:16:59.280]   is, and the only picture that they have of the Savior that's going to come is coming
[00:16:59.280 --> 00:17:01.040]   from passages like this.
[00:17:01.040 --> 00:17:02.040]   Right?
[00:17:02.040 --> 00:17:05.960]   So imagine in their head, they're thinking, He's going to send somebody, He's going to
[00:17:05.960 --> 00:17:10.520]   bring about justice, and this justice is going to free mankind from their sins, He's going
[00:17:10.520 --> 00:17:12.680]   to be the Redeemer, right?
[00:17:12.680 --> 00:17:17.160]   And He's going to be gentle and caring, because a bruised reed and burning wick He's not going
[00:17:17.160 --> 00:17:18.160]   to forsake, right?
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:24.360]   And He's going to come and He's going to care for them, you know, genuinely.
[00:17:24.360 --> 00:17:30.380]   So think about everything that is promised that's going to happen when this Messiah comes.
[00:17:30.380 --> 00:17:36.700]   So imagine the frenzy, so connect all of this, imagine the frenzy that the Jews must have
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:40.420]   had when Jesus was riding in on a donkey, right?
[00:17:40.420 --> 00:17:44.380]   So all of this stuff, that they, like could He be it, could He be it, and then finally
[00:17:44.380 --> 00:17:48.140]   they think He is it, and then think about the disappointment when He was crucified on
[00:17:48.140 --> 00:17:50.420]   the cross, okay?
[00:17:50.420 --> 00:17:54.020]   Not knowing that everything that He was saying was going to happen on the cross, that He
[00:17:54.020 --> 00:17:56.620]   was actually talking about the cross.
[00:17:56.620 --> 00:18:00.580]   But they were thinking, all this is going to happen, He's going to, imagine, so if you
[00:18:00.580 --> 00:18:05.340]   didn't understand the cross, how would you have interpreted all of this?
[00:18:05.340 --> 00:18:08.140]   More money, maybe?
[00:18:08.140 --> 00:18:10.220]   Conquer the Romans?
[00:18:10.220 --> 00:18:11.220]   Better health, right?
[00:18:11.220 --> 00:18:15.860]   I mean, if you didn't understand the cross, and you're thinking the Messiah is going to
[00:18:15.860 --> 00:18:19.260]   come and fulfill all of this, you probably would have thought that.
[00:18:19.260 --> 00:18:23.540]   If you're a fisherman, you're going to catch fish, you know, a boatload of fish every single
[00:18:23.540 --> 00:18:26.020]   time you go out, right?
[00:18:26.020 --> 00:18:30.300]   If you're a soldier, you're going to become the general, I mean, everybody probably projected
[00:18:30.300 --> 00:18:34.700]   what they thought that this meant, right?
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:37.820]   And even the disciples didn't understand it, because they thought, oh, when the Kingdom
[00:18:37.820 --> 00:18:42.260]   comes, when the Kingdom comes, since we're the closest to the Messiah, like, how are
[00:18:42.260 --> 00:18:44.440]   we going to benefit, to the left or to the right?
[00:18:44.440 --> 00:18:48.620]   And so when He went to the cross, even though Jesus clearly said, I'm going to the cross,
[00:18:48.620 --> 00:18:51.100]   they didn't understand it, right?
[00:18:51.100 --> 00:18:52.540]   They clearly didn't understand it.
[00:18:52.540 --> 00:18:58.020]   It wasn't until after He was resurrected, it's like, oh my gosh, even in death, right?
[00:18:58.020 --> 00:19:00.540]   Even in death.
[00:19:00.540 --> 00:19:06.820]   So again, I think this is so important, because even us on this side of the cross, we still
[00:19:06.820 --> 00:19:08.960]   think that.
[00:19:08.960 --> 00:19:13.620]   You know, the cross is something we hang on a church, and we think about, we meditate,
[00:19:13.620 --> 00:19:20.020]   we repeat verses to each other, but when do you really think about the cross as the hope,
[00:19:20.020 --> 00:19:23.700]   the fulfillment of all of this, right?
[00:19:23.700 --> 00:19:30.340]   When we feel like we're bruised, what was it?
[00:19:30.340 --> 00:19:32.140]   Read, right?
[00:19:32.140 --> 00:19:37.220]   Or burning wick, you know, sometimes you feel like that in life.
[00:19:37.220 --> 00:19:43.620]   Like when do we really turn to God and think the cross is the answer to that?
[00:19:43.620 --> 00:19:50.460]   Or do we turn to our friends or family or something, right?
[00:19:50.460 --> 00:19:51.460]   We do the same thing.
[00:19:51.460 --> 00:19:58.180]   We make the same mistake when we forget that all of this was to be fulfilled in Christ,
[00:19:58.180 --> 00:19:59.180]   right?
[00:19:59.180 --> 00:20:03.520]   That's why the Old Testament believers didn't clearly understand, but we have the benefit
[00:20:03.520 --> 00:20:07.860]   of looking back and saying, we know that Jesus is the fulfillment of all of this.
[00:20:07.860 --> 00:20:13.900]   So it's a constant reminder to us that our hope and all the answers, all the promises
[00:20:13.900 --> 00:20:17.060]   are fulfilled because of what Christ has done on the cross, right?
[00:20:17.060 --> 00:20:22.340]   And the moment we forget that is when we get frustrated.
[00:20:22.340 --> 00:20:25.580]   The servant will be the one giving the world a new covenant for the people, light to the
[00:20:25.580 --> 00:20:30.140]   nations.
[00:20:30.140 --> 00:20:35.700]   And then it says, God is jealous for His glory and will not share it with any idol or anything
[00:20:35.700 --> 00:20:38.260]   else, right?
[00:20:38.260 --> 00:20:42.100]   So remember, Jesus came and He says, when He's about to go to the cross, what does He
[00:20:42.100 --> 00:20:43.100]   say?
[00:20:43.100 --> 00:20:47.580]   It's time to glorify your son and for the son to glorify the father, right?
[00:20:47.580 --> 00:20:51.500]   And He said, I will share my glory with nobody else.
[00:20:51.500 --> 00:20:56.780]   So if the cross is where God is glorified the most, He said, I will not share, right,
[00:20:56.780 --> 00:20:58.860]   what He fulfilled on the cross with anything else.
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:05.060]   If we turn to anything else but the cross, right, we taint His glory.
[00:21:05.060 --> 00:21:10.340]   And He clearly says, He is jealously guarding His glory, right?
[00:21:10.340 --> 00:21:18.740]   So in other words, we can interpret that as He's jealously guarding the cross.
[00:21:18.740 --> 00:21:33.220]   Okay, this is one of the application questions I have.
[00:21:33.220 --> 00:21:37.860]   You guys can discuss this later.
[00:21:37.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   What is the cause of joy?
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:43.940]   So we move to verse 7, or 10 to 17, where the people break out into song.
[00:21:43.940 --> 00:21:49.860]   But what is the cause of this joy in singing in verse 10 through 12?
[00:21:49.860 --> 00:21:55.940]   Up to this point, it says the Lord restrained Himself, right, in responding to injustices.
[00:21:55.940 --> 00:21:59.500]   He's been observing and watching, but now finally, He's going to act.
[00:21:59.500 --> 00:22:03.500]   He's going to stir up His zeal.
[00:22:03.500 --> 00:22:07.360]   The Lord, in verse 13, the Lord goes out like a mighty man, like a man of war.
[00:22:07.360 --> 00:22:08.720]   He stirs up His zeal.
[00:22:08.720 --> 00:22:12.720]   He cries out, He shouts aloud, He shows Himself mighty against His foes.
[00:22:12.720 --> 00:22:17.900]   So people will know that God is acting, right?
[00:22:17.900 --> 00:22:21.760]   The devil, you know, when he works, he's always scheming.
[00:22:21.760 --> 00:22:24.700]   It's almost kind of like, you don't know he's there.
[00:22:24.700 --> 00:22:26.640]   When he's working, people are not paying attention.
[00:22:26.640 --> 00:22:29.560]   His name is not on the lips of the people.
[00:22:29.560 --> 00:22:34.960]   But when God works, He says He does nothing without proclaiming to His servants first,
[00:22:34.960 --> 00:22:36.080]   right?
[00:22:36.080 --> 00:22:40.960]   He said when He works, people know that God is coming, right?
[00:22:40.960 --> 00:22:41.960]   So He's in the light.
[00:22:41.960 --> 00:22:42.960]   He's not in darkness.
[00:22:42.960 --> 00:22:43.960]   He's not scheming.
[00:22:43.960 --> 00:22:47.160]   You know, He's not behind the scene, but He makes it very clear.
[00:22:47.160 --> 00:22:49.200]   So look at all the miracles that He performs.
[00:22:49.200 --> 00:22:54.640]   When He performs miracles, the end result is in, did God do that?
[00:22:54.640 --> 00:22:55.640]   Right?
[00:22:55.640 --> 00:23:00.960]   So even people who don't want to believe Him can't deny His miracles, right?
[00:23:00.960 --> 00:23:05.120]   So when God shows up, there is no ambiguity.
[00:23:05.120 --> 00:23:07.600]   That's basically what He says, right?
[00:23:07.600 --> 00:23:12.320]   He's going to declare it, because His whole purpose is to declare His glory.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.200]   So He's not going to hide and give that glory to somebody else.
[00:23:15.200 --> 00:23:20.280]   When it happens, people will know that was Him, right?
[00:23:20.280 --> 00:23:22.680]   And I, again, let me go off track a little bit.
[00:23:22.680 --> 00:23:28.880]   That's why the church, when we rely upon our method, our scheming, and our intelligence,
[00:23:28.880 --> 00:23:31.720]   we kind of take away from His glory, right?
[00:23:31.720 --> 00:23:36.040]   We take away from His glory, because at the end, if we become successful, we're going
[00:23:36.040 --> 00:23:37.680]   to say we did it.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:40.400]   In the name of Jesus, but we're going to say we did it, right?
[00:23:40.400 --> 00:23:45.000]   There's a reason why God chose the dumb, right?
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:46.680]   The foolish.
[00:23:46.680 --> 00:23:50.240]   Because and the worst of sinners.
[00:23:50.240 --> 00:23:54.680]   Because when God moves, no one can touch the glory, right?
[00:23:54.680 --> 00:24:01.480]   And so I think in the end, the call of the church is to become as dumb as possible.
[00:24:01.480 --> 00:24:06.720]   I mean, in some sense, you know what I'm saying, right?
[00:24:06.720 --> 00:24:12.960]   I'm not saying like, you know, not to know how to do anything, but dumb as possible in
[00:24:12.960 --> 00:24:15.840]   the sense that, yeah, like what's your strategy?
[00:24:15.840 --> 00:24:20.960]   We're going to pray, we're going to read the Bible, and we're going to obey.
[00:24:20.960 --> 00:24:25.040]   And then let God do what He said He's going to do, right?
[00:24:25.040 --> 00:24:27.520]   Don't complicate God's Word.
[00:24:27.520 --> 00:24:33.680]   To even the smartest of people, it's the lowest common denominator, we're going to pray, we're
[00:24:33.680 --> 00:24:36.320]   going to humble ourselves, and we're going to obey.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:45.480]   And then let God do the work, so that when something happens, that He gets the credit.
[00:24:45.480 --> 00:24:47.880]   He will lead, and He will guide the blind.
[00:24:47.880 --> 00:24:54.680]   Again, the term blindness is always, oftentimes in the Bible, in reference to spiritual blindness,
[00:24:54.680 --> 00:24:59.960]   the people who have not recognized Him in the past, who were not able to see Him, God's
[00:24:59.960 --> 00:25:03.160]   going to show up, and they're going to see Him, right?
[00:25:03.160 --> 00:25:07.160]   And when He brings restoration to His people, there's always the other side, judgment and
[00:25:07.160 --> 00:25:11.020]   shame for those who trust in idols, right?
[00:25:11.020 --> 00:25:12.200]   So we talked about that before.
[00:25:12.200 --> 00:25:14.640]   The second coming, there's a two-edged sword.
[00:25:14.640 --> 00:25:22.280]   There's one who comes to redeem His church, His bride, and the other one comes to judge.
[00:25:22.280 --> 00:25:35.640]   Again, an application question, I'll leave that to you guys.
[00:25:35.640 --> 00:25:36.640]   How do you hear?
[00:25:36.640 --> 00:25:44.800]   Verse 18 of chapter 42, it says, "Hear you deaf, and look you blind, that you may see."
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:50.400]   I mean, it'd be a cruel joke to go to somebody who's deaf and say, "Hey, listen to me!"
[00:25:50.400 --> 00:25:51.400]   Right?
[00:25:51.400 --> 00:25:54.200]   Somebody who's blind and say, "Hey, see!"
[00:25:54.200 --> 00:25:55.280]   Right?
[00:25:55.280 --> 00:26:00.280]   That's exactly what God is doing.
[00:26:00.280 --> 00:26:05.520]   What does that tell us about their blindness and their deafness?
[00:26:05.520 --> 00:26:08.040]   Oops.
[00:26:08.040 --> 00:26:13.480]   Is there no answer to this?
[00:26:13.480 --> 00:26:19.780]   All right, I didn't put the answer.
[00:26:19.780 --> 00:26:20.780]   What does that teach us?
[00:26:20.780 --> 00:26:26.160]   The fact that God is telling them to see and to hear, what does that tell us about their
[00:26:26.160 --> 00:26:29.160]   deafness and their blindness?
[00:26:29.160 --> 00:26:30.160]   Huh?
[00:26:30.160 --> 00:26:31.160]   Self-inflicted.
[00:26:31.160 --> 00:26:32.160]   Self-inflicted.
[00:26:32.160 --> 00:26:33.160]   Right?
[00:26:33.160 --> 00:26:37.200]   They chose it.
[00:26:37.200 --> 00:26:38.200]   They chose it.
[00:26:38.200 --> 00:26:42.440]   Just like Romans chapter 1, they rather be in darkness than in the light, so they chose
[00:26:42.440 --> 00:26:43.440]   the darkness.
[00:26:43.440 --> 00:26:44.440]   Right?
[00:26:44.440 --> 00:26:46.040]   So that's what God is saying.
[00:26:46.040 --> 00:26:48.160]   So it wasn't like, "Hey, God made me this way."
[00:26:48.160 --> 00:26:49.160]   Right?
[00:26:49.160 --> 00:26:54.800]   It said, "No, you love darkness better than light, and that's why you choose to not listen."
[00:26:54.800 --> 00:26:58.280]   Right?
[00:26:58.280 --> 00:27:03.720]   You ever try to counsel somebody who is committed to do something that is clearly wrong, and
[00:27:03.720 --> 00:27:07.120]   you try so hard to reason with them, but there is no reasoning?
[00:27:07.120 --> 00:27:09.800]   Ever happen to you?
[00:27:09.800 --> 00:27:11.480]   That happens to me every once in a while.
[00:27:11.480 --> 00:27:12.480]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:12.480 --> 00:27:17.240]   You talk to somebody, and it's just, and they would have agreed with me before, and they
[00:27:17.240 --> 00:27:18.880]   would have agreed with me after.
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:24.160]   But when they're in that context where they're just like, they want this so bad, there's
[00:27:24.160 --> 00:27:26.360]   no reasoning with them.
[00:27:26.360 --> 00:27:29.720]   And it's frustrating because anybody can see it.
[00:27:29.720 --> 00:27:30.720]   Right?
[00:27:30.720 --> 00:27:33.880]   And they're putting all kinds of logic, all kinds of reasoning.
[00:27:33.880 --> 00:27:35.680]   It doesn't make any sense, you know?
[00:27:35.680 --> 00:27:41.160]   And a brand new believer would know, would be able to discern, you know?
[00:27:41.160 --> 00:27:43.920]   And it's like, you come back and say, "There's no way that you're blind.
[00:27:43.920 --> 00:27:45.760]   You're blind because you want to be blind."
[00:27:45.760 --> 00:27:46.760]   Right?
[00:27:46.760 --> 00:27:50.160]   You're looking for reasons to justify what you want to do.
[00:27:50.160 --> 00:27:52.600]   And it causes you to be blind.
[00:27:52.600 --> 00:27:54.680]   Right?
[00:27:54.680 --> 00:28:02.840]   What does it mean to see many things but do not observe, and to have his ears open
[00:28:02.840 --> 00:28:03.840]   but not hear?
[00:28:03.840 --> 00:28:04.840]   Okay?
[00:28:04.840 --> 00:28:10.160]   It's related to what we just talked about, right?
[00:28:10.160 --> 00:28:13.920]   The rebuke is against the Israel who convey the message of the Lord without following
[00:28:13.920 --> 00:28:14.920]   it themselves.
[00:28:14.920 --> 00:28:15.920]   Right?
[00:28:15.920 --> 00:28:19.040]   What does this tell us about the calling of Israel?
[00:28:19.040 --> 00:28:20.440]   Right?
[00:28:20.440 --> 00:28:25.920]   Israel was called to be a light to the other nations, but because they themselves were
[00:28:25.920 --> 00:28:29.000]   not living in the light, right?
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:31.360]   They just had the title of God's people.
[00:28:31.360 --> 00:28:34.680]   But they weren't functioning as God's people.
[00:28:34.680 --> 00:28:36.560]   Right?
[00:28:36.560 --> 00:28:41.520]   Just like the church can have the title of the church, the body of Christ.
[00:28:41.520 --> 00:28:44.720]   Right?
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:49.600]   So God gave them ears, God gave them eyes, but they couldn't see.
[00:28:49.600 --> 00:28:50.600]   Right?
[00:28:50.600 --> 00:28:53.400]   Because they chose to.
[00:28:53.400 --> 00:28:56.320]   And then they become like plunder for the leaders to take advantage of.
[00:28:56.320 --> 00:28:58.880]   In other words, they're sitting ducks.
[00:28:58.880 --> 00:29:00.440]   Right?
[00:29:00.440 --> 00:29:05.840]   Because they strayed away from their shepherd, they're open to any wolf coming in and taking
[00:29:05.840 --> 00:29:07.400]   advantage of them.
[00:29:07.400 --> 00:29:12.040]   So that's why when the false prophets came, they clung to them.
[00:29:12.040 --> 00:29:14.360]   They were so easy to deceive.
[00:29:14.360 --> 00:29:15.760]   Right?
[00:29:15.760 --> 00:29:21.840]   So during the time of Isaiah, false prophets were rampant.
[00:29:21.840 --> 00:29:25.700]   They're contradicting what Isaiah's saying, contradicting what Hosea's saying, contradicting
[00:29:25.700 --> 00:29:30.080]   what Amos is saying, because all of them had the message that they didn't want.
[00:29:30.080 --> 00:29:31.080]   Right?
[00:29:31.080 --> 00:29:35.160]   So false teaching, false prophecy was rampant, and there was confusion as to what the truth
[00:29:35.160 --> 00:29:40.680]   was because they strayed away from their shepherd, so they were vulnerable to any kind of wolf
[00:29:40.680 --> 00:29:41.680]   coming in.
[00:29:41.680 --> 00:29:42.680]   Right?
[00:29:42.680 --> 00:29:48.440]   That's why I think whenever you take the Word of God away from the church, like anything,
[00:29:48.440 --> 00:29:49.520]   what is that saying?
[00:29:49.520 --> 00:29:52.120]   If you don't stand for anything, you'll fall for anything.
[00:29:52.120 --> 00:29:54.320]   If you don't stand for something, you're, yeah.
[00:29:54.320 --> 00:29:56.720]   But that something isn't just anything, obviously.
[00:29:56.720 --> 00:29:57.720]   Right?
[00:29:57.720 --> 00:29:59.160]   As Christians.
[00:29:59.160 --> 00:30:04.240]   If we're not grounded upon Christ and we're drifting, right, you can drift to anything.
[00:30:04.240 --> 00:30:05.320]   You're vulnerable to anything.
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:10.200]   Any new thought, any new theology, any new type of whatever trend comes in, the next
[00:30:10.200 --> 00:30:12.320]   generation, you become successful to that.
[00:30:12.320 --> 00:30:19.800]   So the church that is drifting will look different today, ten years later it'll look different
[00:30:19.800 --> 00:30:24.220]   ten years later, ten years after that it'll look something different, because it's always
[00:30:24.220 --> 00:30:27.400]   shifting from whatever happens to be coming in.
[00:30:27.400 --> 00:30:29.360]   Whatever happens to be trendy.
[00:30:29.360 --> 00:30:30.360]   Right?
[00:30:30.360 --> 00:30:34.440]   But a church that is grounded upon the Word of God shouldn't look different from generation
[00:30:34.440 --> 00:30:35.440]   to generation.
[00:30:35.440 --> 00:30:36.440]   Right?
[00:30:36.440 --> 00:30:40.360]   It shouldn't look different from the early church to the Middle Ages to now.
[00:30:40.360 --> 00:30:42.400]   The true church.
[00:30:42.400 --> 00:30:43.920]   Right?
[00:30:43.920 --> 00:30:49.040]   He said, "The Lord burned with anger against the leaders, but they did not understand."
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:54.800]   In other words, verse 25, he says, "So He poured on him the heat of His anger and the
[00:30:54.800 --> 00:30:56.140]   might of battle.
[00:30:56.140 --> 00:30:58.720]   It set him on fire all around, but he did not understand.
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.960]   It burned him up, but he did not take it to heart."
[00:31:01.960 --> 00:31:05.960]   What does that mean?
[00:31:05.960 --> 00:31:10.080]   All of the judgment that he brought upon the nation of Israel, the leaders of Israel,
[00:31:10.080 --> 00:31:15.320]   the captivity to Babylon, Assyrians coming and attacking them, all of that was for what
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:19.380]   purpose?
[00:31:19.380 --> 00:31:21.920]   To discipline them, to bring them to repentance.
[00:31:21.920 --> 00:31:23.280]   But they didn't see it.
[00:31:23.280 --> 00:31:24.280]   Right?
[00:31:24.280 --> 00:31:27.880]   So they clung to God when they were in need, but as soon as they were in safety, they went
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:37.800]   right back to where they were.
[00:31:37.800 --> 00:31:41.880]   So Israel may have been asking questions of why.
[00:31:41.880 --> 00:31:45.440]   Like why did all this happen?
[00:31:45.440 --> 00:31:46.760]   Why did we go into captivity?
[00:31:46.760 --> 00:31:49.640]   Why were we conquered over and over again?
[00:31:49.640 --> 00:31:54.480]   But the answer that he gives in verse 24 is not why, but who.
[00:31:54.480 --> 00:31:55.480]   Verse 24.
[00:31:55.480 --> 00:32:00.120]   "Who gave up Jacob to the looters and Israel to the plunderers?
[00:32:00.120 --> 00:32:03.560]   Was it not the Lord against whom he has sinned?
[00:32:03.560 --> 00:32:09.380]   In whose ways they would not walk and whose law they would not obey?"
[00:32:09.380 --> 00:32:12.320]   So the question was why, but he says who.
[00:32:12.320 --> 00:32:13.720]   The answer was who.
[00:32:13.720 --> 00:32:18.400]   Once you realize who did it, then you know why he did it.
[00:32:18.400 --> 00:32:20.440]   Right?
[00:32:20.440 --> 00:32:21.640]   It wasn't Cyrus.
[00:32:21.640 --> 00:32:22.800]   It wasn't Assyria.
[00:32:22.800 --> 00:32:24.000]   It wasn't the Babylonians.
[00:32:24.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   It wasn't the Egyptians.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:26.000]   It was God.
[00:32:26.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   Right?
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:31.640]   God didn't temporarily lose control, and that's why the Assyrians came into power.
[00:32:31.640 --> 00:32:35.600]   Like God didn't all of a sudden was fighting the Babylonians, and then they overpowered
[00:32:35.600 --> 00:32:38.840]   Him, so the Babylonians took control for a period.
[00:32:38.840 --> 00:32:39.840]   Right?
[00:32:39.840 --> 00:32:43.160]   It wasn't because He was weak and He couldn't keep them at bay.
[00:32:43.160 --> 00:32:47.160]   It wasn't because He lost battle with the Romans that they were in power.
[00:32:47.160 --> 00:32:50.880]   So what he's saying is all the things that have happened to the nation is because He
[00:32:50.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   did it.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:52.880]   It wasn't the Romans.
[00:32:52.880 --> 00:32:53.880]   Right?
[00:32:53.880 --> 00:32:54.880]   It wasn't the Egyptians.
[00:32:54.880 --> 00:32:57.160]   In the end, it wasn't even the devil.
[00:32:57.160 --> 00:32:58.840]   Right?
[00:32:58.840 --> 00:33:03.440]   If you really think about it, and you believe in a sovereign God, look at Lot.
[00:33:03.440 --> 00:33:06.460]   Devil's the one who initiated, and God said, "Have you considered My servant?"
[00:33:06.460 --> 00:33:08.880]   And then he doesn't even appear anymore.
[00:33:08.880 --> 00:33:12.080]   At the end of Lot's life, he doesn't say, "Why did the devil do this?"
[00:33:12.080 --> 00:33:14.680]   Well, who did I say?
[00:33:14.680 --> 00:33:17.480]   Yeah, you know what I meant.
[00:33:17.480 --> 00:33:18.480]   Right?
[00:33:18.480 --> 00:33:19.480]   Job.
[00:33:19.480 --> 00:33:20.480]   Right?
[00:33:20.480 --> 00:33:21.480]   Thank you for correcting me.
[00:33:21.480 --> 00:33:24.760]   There's got to be one person in here that could leave this video and say, "Yeah, Lot
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:25.760]   went through a lot."
[00:33:25.760 --> 00:33:30.760]   Yeah, we're talking about Job.
[00:33:30.760 --> 00:33:32.120]   Okay?
[00:33:32.120 --> 00:33:34.680]   So in other words, he's saying that the sovereign God was in control.
[00:33:34.680 --> 00:33:38.240]   In other words, He was in control of all of it.
[00:33:38.240 --> 00:33:40.080]   He was in control when redemption was coming.
[00:33:40.080 --> 00:33:42.640]   He was in control when the Babylonians were there.
[00:33:42.640 --> 00:33:44.720]   He was in control when the famine was there.
[00:33:44.720 --> 00:33:46.160]   He was in control of all of it.
[00:33:46.160 --> 00:33:47.160]   Right?
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:48.160]   Why did He do it?
[00:33:48.160 --> 00:33:49.160]   He went to repentance.
[00:33:49.160 --> 00:33:50.160]   Right?
[00:33:50.160 --> 00:33:59.440]   And again, this is an application question.
[00:33:59.440 --> 00:34:02.320]   I'll just leave that for you for the end.
[00:34:02.320 --> 00:34:04.440]   Okay?
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:09.440]   Despite the many sins of Israel, what does God promise Israel in verse 1 and 2, and why
[00:34:09.440 --> 00:34:10.440]   in verse 4?
[00:34:10.440 --> 00:34:17.040]   He says, "One, that He will redeem them."
[00:34:17.040 --> 00:34:19.640]   How many times has He done this?
[00:34:19.640 --> 00:34:22.040]   Right?
[00:34:22.040 --> 00:34:25.160]   How many times has He forgiven you, forgiven me?
[00:34:25.160 --> 00:34:26.160]   Right?
[00:34:26.160 --> 00:34:28.360]   I mean, think about it.
[00:34:28.360 --> 00:34:35.040]   If salvation was by works, just practically speaking, we wouldn't be here.
[00:34:35.040 --> 00:34:37.280]   Right?
[00:34:37.280 --> 00:34:42.480]   I don't know how long it would have taken, but we wouldn't be here.
[00:34:42.480 --> 00:34:46.920]   Only reason why you're still here, are able to listen, able to study the Word of God,
[00:34:46.920 --> 00:34:50.400]   is because, like we said on Sunday, because God promised it.
[00:34:50.400 --> 00:34:52.360]   He made a covenant with Himself.
[00:34:52.360 --> 00:34:53.360]   Right?
[00:34:53.360 --> 00:34:57.600]   So despite Israel's sin, He's still, He's still patient with them.
[00:34:57.600 --> 00:34:58.600]   Right?
[00:34:58.600 --> 00:35:00.160]   So He's kind of come to redeem them.
[00:35:00.160 --> 00:35:02.920]   He's not only going to redeem them, forgive them of their sins, He says He's going to
[00:35:02.920 --> 00:35:06.520]   protect them in verse 2.
[00:35:06.520 --> 00:35:09.040]   Right?
[00:35:09.040 --> 00:35:15.000]   And ultimately, in verse 4, "Because you are precious in my eyes, and honored, and
[00:35:15.000 --> 00:35:16.800]   I love you."
[00:35:16.800 --> 00:35:19.960]   I give men in return for you, people in exchange for your life.
[00:35:19.960 --> 00:35:21.960]   He says, "I love you."
[00:35:21.960 --> 00:35:23.400]   Right?
[00:35:23.400 --> 00:35:27.720]   I remember as a young Christian, I was reading this for the first time, and this is the first
[00:35:27.720 --> 00:35:33.240]   time I remember where God Himself just directly says, "I love you."
[00:35:33.240 --> 00:35:35.560]   And I memorized this verse.
[00:35:35.560 --> 00:35:36.560]   Right?
[00:35:36.560 --> 00:35:41.040]   "I love you."
[00:35:41.040 --> 00:35:47.240]   I mean, I think people are changed, like when you feel loved.
[00:35:47.240 --> 00:35:48.240]   Right?
[00:35:48.240 --> 00:35:50.880]   By anybody.
[00:35:50.880 --> 00:35:56.800]   But to be loved by God, to be an object of the love of God, and if you really believe
[00:35:56.800 --> 00:36:02.720]   that, that God who created the universe loves you, you know, what does that mean?
[00:36:02.720 --> 00:36:03.720]   You're safe.
[00:36:03.720 --> 00:36:04.720]   Right?
[00:36:04.720 --> 00:36:07.640]   Psalm 23, "For I walk through the valley of the shadow of evil."
[00:36:07.640 --> 00:36:08.640]   Right?
[00:36:09.240 --> 00:36:12.080]   "Valley of the shadow of death, I shall feel no evil."
[00:36:12.080 --> 00:36:14.720]   Because why would you not fear evil?
[00:36:14.720 --> 00:36:15.840]   Right?
[00:36:15.840 --> 00:36:17.840]   Because God loves you.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:18.840]   Right?
[00:36:18.840 --> 00:36:24.480]   I don't think we're being too touchy-feely when we talk about this, because I think it's
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:28.840]   extremely important that we realize that God doesn't just care about you, He doesn't just
[00:36:28.840 --> 00:36:33.680]   count your hair, He doesn't just like, you know, feel obligated because of His covenant.
[00:36:33.680 --> 00:36:36.160]   He says, "You're precious in my eyes."
[00:36:36.160 --> 00:36:39.040]   He says, "I love you."
[00:36:39.040 --> 00:36:40.040]   Right?
[00:36:40.040 --> 00:36:43.640]   I mean, that's important.
[00:36:43.640 --> 00:36:45.800]   That's really, really important.
[00:36:45.800 --> 00:36:47.280]   Who do you say I am?
[00:36:47.280 --> 00:36:48.280]   Right?
[00:36:48.280 --> 00:36:52.200]   Because I know who you are to me.
[00:36:52.200 --> 00:36:57.940]   And I think if you're not convinced of this, if you're not convinced that you're precious
[00:36:57.940 --> 00:37:05.000]   in God's eyes and that He loves you, you know, this is the reason why we run from Him.
[00:37:05.000 --> 00:37:10.160]   You know, when we make mistakes, or, you know, not realizing how much we mean to Him.
[00:37:10.160 --> 00:37:11.600]   Right?
[00:37:11.600 --> 00:37:22.640]   If it was up to me, I'd just linger here for a while.
[00:37:22.640 --> 00:37:25.680]   Yeah.
[00:37:25.680 --> 00:37:28.480]   According to verse 7, why were we created?
[00:37:28.480 --> 00:37:32.120]   How does that affect the way we think of our jobs, or leisure, or money?
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:33.120]   Like what was the purpose?
[00:37:33.240 --> 00:37:34.920]   He says, "He created us for His glory."
[00:37:34.920 --> 00:37:40.600]   Right?
[00:37:40.600 --> 00:37:46.080]   It's interesting how in verse 8, He says, "Bring out the people who are blind, yet have
[00:37:46.080 --> 00:37:48.280]   eyes, who are deaf, yet have ears."
[00:37:48.280 --> 00:37:49.280]   Right?
[00:37:49.280 --> 00:37:52.400]   People who are physically, they're blind, but they can see.
[00:37:52.400 --> 00:37:53.400]   Right?
[00:37:53.400 --> 00:37:54.480]   Deaf, but they can hear.
[00:37:54.480 --> 00:37:56.560]   The exact opposite of verse 18 and 20.
[00:37:56.560 --> 00:37:59.080]   It's saying they have eyes, but they do not see.
[00:37:59.080 --> 00:38:00.880]   They have ears, but they do not hear.
[00:38:00.880 --> 00:38:03.880]   But when God brings redemption, it's exactly the opposite.
[00:38:03.880 --> 00:38:05.760]   Even the people who don't see, will see.
[00:38:05.760 --> 00:38:08.320]   Even the people who don't hear, will hear.
[00:38:08.320 --> 00:38:09.320]   Right?
[00:38:09.320 --> 00:38:21.800]   Probably my favorite, favorite song ever is a Korean song written by a paraplegic in Korean.
[00:38:21.800 --> 00:38:28.520]   And basically, just a summary of the song is how God is so fair.
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.160]   And how she writes, I'm not going to say it in Korean.
[00:38:32.160 --> 00:38:33.400]   I'm going to try to translate it.
[00:38:33.400 --> 00:38:39.200]   It says, "God is so fair because God has given me what other people don't have."
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:45.480]   Because of her disabilities, that she's able to see Christ and see, hear more deeply, and
[00:38:45.480 --> 00:38:47.400]   see more clearly because of her.
[00:38:47.400 --> 00:38:48.800]   And she's like, "How God is so fair.
[00:38:48.800 --> 00:38:49.800]   God is so fair."
[00:38:49.800 --> 00:38:50.800]   Right?
[00:38:50.800 --> 00:38:55.000]   One of these days, I'll translate it for you.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:56.000]   The whole song.
[00:38:56.000 --> 00:38:57.000]   Right?
[00:38:57.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   God's favorite, favorite song.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:00.360]   And that's what he says.
[00:39:00.360 --> 00:39:03.920]   When he appears, and even the people who cannot see, will see.
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:09.560]   He does exactly the opposite.
[00:39:09.560 --> 00:39:10.560]   So what does he say?
[00:39:10.560 --> 00:39:13.600]   Now, he calls the nation of Israel to be his light.
[00:39:13.600 --> 00:39:16.400]   And he says, "What do they first must do?"
[00:39:16.400 --> 00:39:21.320]   He says, "They must first come and see and witness before they can declare his glory."
[00:39:21.320 --> 00:39:22.800]   Verse 9 and 10.
[00:39:22.800 --> 00:39:28.000]   "All the nations gather together in a people's assemble who among them can declare this and
[00:39:28.000 --> 00:39:29.660]   show us the former things.
[00:39:29.660 --> 00:39:35.040]   Let them bring their witness to prove them right and let them hear and say, 'It is true.
[00:39:35.040 --> 00:39:38.960]   You are my witnesses, declares the Lord, and my servant whom I have chosen, that you may
[00:39:38.960 --> 00:39:41.320]   know and believe me and understand that I am he.
[00:39:41.320 --> 00:39:45.120]   Before me no God was formed, nor shall there be any after me."
[00:39:45.120 --> 00:39:49.040]   In other words, you know, it says, "Be still and know that I am Lord."
[00:39:49.040 --> 00:39:50.040]   Right?
[00:39:50.040 --> 00:39:53.800]   So, it's like, before he sends his disciples out, what does he tell them to do?
[00:39:53.800 --> 00:39:54.800]   "Come follow me."
[00:39:54.800 --> 00:39:55.800]   Right?
[00:39:55.800 --> 00:39:59.200]   So, in the three years, yes, he did train them.
[00:39:59.200 --> 00:40:00.200]   He sent them out.
[00:40:00.200 --> 00:40:05.600]   He showed them how to pray for people and to heal the sick and all that.
[00:40:05.600 --> 00:40:09.180]   But above everything that he's done, the greatest thing that he did in those three years was
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:12.480]   he revealed himself to them.
[00:40:12.480 --> 00:40:13.480]   That's what he did.
[00:40:13.480 --> 00:40:14.860]   More than anything else, he revealed himself.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:18.240]   Because the greatest thing that they were going to do is to be their witness.
[00:40:18.240 --> 00:40:19.960]   Be his witness.
[00:40:19.960 --> 00:40:22.320]   Not simply to do what he did.
[00:40:22.320 --> 00:40:23.320]   Right?
[00:40:23.320 --> 00:40:24.320]   Which he did.
[00:40:24.320 --> 00:40:27.040]   He said, "I'm going to show you how to make fishers of men."
[00:40:27.040 --> 00:40:31.880]   But the greatest thing that they received in the years that they were with Jesus was
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:34.120]   they saw Jesus up close.
[00:40:34.120 --> 00:40:35.480]   Right?
[00:40:35.480 --> 00:40:36.840]   And so what was their primary job?
[00:40:36.840 --> 00:40:38.360]   It's to declare his glory.
[00:40:38.360 --> 00:40:42.240]   So if you're going to declare his glory, you have to see his glory.
[00:40:42.240 --> 00:40:44.040]   Right?
[00:40:44.040 --> 00:40:49.920]   So whether you go into ministry, whether you make disciples, whether you serve the church,
[00:40:49.920 --> 00:40:56.280]   the greatest preparation for God's ministry is to behold his glory.
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:57.720]   Right?
[00:40:57.720 --> 00:41:01.720]   Because the primary work that he calls us to do is to declare his glory.
[00:41:01.720 --> 00:41:05.560]   So how can somebody who doesn't behold his glory declare his glory?
[00:41:05.560 --> 00:41:06.560]   Right?
[00:41:06.560 --> 00:41:10.760]   So the greatest thing that God calls every Christian to do is to come and behold his
[00:41:10.760 --> 00:41:11.760]   glory.
[00:41:11.760 --> 00:41:12.760]   Right?
[00:41:12.760 --> 00:41:19.800]   So if we're not affected by his glory, by his mercy, how can we be a witness?
[00:41:19.800 --> 00:41:22.140]   We can regurgitate information.
[00:41:22.140 --> 00:41:25.120]   We can take the things that we've studied and just present it to them.
[00:41:25.120 --> 00:41:29.880]   So if you are a good communicator, if you like to read, you know.
[00:41:29.880 --> 00:41:31.320]   But that's not what God called us to do.
[00:41:31.320 --> 00:41:33.640]   God called us to be a witness, to be a light.
[00:41:33.640 --> 00:41:34.640]   Right?
[00:41:34.640 --> 00:41:36.800]   A smaller light of the greater light.
[00:41:36.800 --> 00:41:39.760]   So that's why first and foremost he tells us to come.
[00:41:39.760 --> 00:41:40.760]   Right?
[00:41:40.760 --> 00:41:43.520]   Isn't that the story about Mary and Martha?
[00:41:43.520 --> 00:41:44.520]   Right?
[00:41:44.520 --> 00:41:49.600]   It's not, I mean, Martha would be the one praised in the church because she's the one
[00:41:49.600 --> 00:41:51.560]   doing all the work.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:52.640]   Right?
[00:41:52.640 --> 00:41:54.760]   So he's not, does God call us to work?
[00:41:54.760 --> 00:41:57.000]   Of course he calls us to work.
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:00.880]   You know, would Jesus be okay if all Mary did was sat there and she never helped with
[00:42:00.880 --> 00:42:02.360]   the dishes?
[00:42:02.360 --> 00:42:03.360]   Never did anything?
[00:42:03.360 --> 00:42:04.960]   Of course that's not what he's saying.
[00:42:04.960 --> 00:42:09.360]   He said she chose what's best.
[00:42:09.360 --> 00:42:14.520]   The best was sitting at Jesus' feet, soaking up everything that Jesus was saying.
[00:42:14.520 --> 00:42:15.520]   Right?
[00:42:15.520 --> 00:42:21.920]   Because the one who beholds his glory is going to be the greatest witness for Jesus.
[00:42:21.920 --> 00:42:23.560]   Right?
[00:42:23.560 --> 00:42:28.200]   So consider each description of Jesus.
[00:42:28.200 --> 00:42:32.520]   Again, he's the Redeemer, the Holy One of Israel.
[00:42:32.520 --> 00:42:36.680]   He's the one who created Israel.
[00:42:36.680 --> 00:42:42.440]   Because he's the one who created Israel, verse 15, he's the King of Israel.
[00:42:42.440 --> 00:42:48.920]   And this King isn't just the King of Israel, he's sovereign over all creation.
[00:42:48.920 --> 00:42:51.160]   And all of these things are very personal.
[00:42:51.160 --> 00:42:55.120]   He's not giving some generic title.
[00:42:55.120 --> 00:42:58.000]   He's saying all of this personally because he's redeeming them.
[00:42:58.000 --> 00:42:59.320]   He's their Redeemer.
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:00.360]   He's their Creator.
[00:43:00.360 --> 00:43:01.640]   He's their King.
[00:43:01.640 --> 00:43:04.200]   And that King is the King of all creation.
[00:43:04.200 --> 00:43:05.200]   Right?
[00:43:05.200 --> 00:43:09.200]   In other words, to have confidence in him.
[00:43:09.200 --> 00:43:11.040]   Right?
[00:43:11.040 --> 00:43:13.040]   Because he cares.
[00:43:13.040 --> 00:43:19.040]   Like, cast all your anxiety upon him because he cares for you.
[00:43:19.040 --> 00:43:21.040]   Right?
[00:43:21.040 --> 00:43:27.280]   Isn't that the first thing that happens when we feel like, you know, things are going out
[00:43:27.280 --> 00:43:29.840]   of control and it's in our hands?
[00:43:29.840 --> 00:43:33.080]   We become anxious when things don't go according to plan.
[00:43:33.080 --> 00:43:34.160]   Right?
[00:43:34.160 --> 00:43:35.160]   That's the first thing that happens.
[00:43:35.160 --> 00:43:36.160]   We become anxious.
[00:43:36.160 --> 00:43:40.920]   So, think about that in a larger scale as a nation.
[00:43:40.920 --> 00:43:43.680]   When the enemies start coming in, right?
[00:43:43.680 --> 00:43:44.800]   And things are out of control.
[00:43:44.800 --> 00:43:45.800]   What if they come?
[00:43:45.800 --> 00:43:46.800]   What if they take us?
[00:43:46.800 --> 00:43:52.760]   And so, we can understand, humanly speaking, why they would align themselves with the Egyptians.
[00:43:52.760 --> 00:43:55.160]   And with the Syrians, and the Assyrians, and the Babylonians.
[00:43:55.160 --> 00:43:58.440]   We can understand that because we struggle with the same thing.
[00:43:58.440 --> 00:43:59.440]   Right?
[00:43:59.440 --> 00:44:02.800]   When trials come and things get out of hand, like, what do we run to?
[00:44:02.800 --> 00:44:07.560]   So, the whole reason why he's saying all of this is because he's the, he's, like, I'm
[00:44:07.560 --> 00:44:08.560]   your Redeemer.
[00:44:08.560 --> 00:44:09.560]   I'm your Creator.
[00:44:09.560 --> 00:44:10.560]   I'm your King.
[00:44:10.560 --> 00:44:11.560]   Right?
[00:44:11.560 --> 00:44:14.440]   And ultimately, because I care about you.
[00:44:14.440 --> 00:44:17.840]   Right?
[00:44:17.840 --> 00:44:19.640]   And ultimately, how did he respond?
[00:44:19.640 --> 00:44:22.760]   Like, despite all of that, they didn't come to him.
[00:44:22.760 --> 00:44:26.560]   They didn't sacrifice to him.
[00:44:26.560 --> 00:44:28.840]   And their sins burdened him.
[00:44:28.840 --> 00:44:29.840]   Right?
[00:44:29.880 --> 00:44:34.720]   Again, remember, he was saying, he was going back and forth, back and forth.
[00:44:34.720 --> 00:44:37.280]   How he cares, he's going to redeem them.
[00:44:37.280 --> 00:44:38.280]   Right?
[00:44:38.280 --> 00:44:40.160]   But, despite that, you keep running.
[00:44:40.160 --> 00:44:41.160]   Right?
[00:44:41.160 --> 00:44:42.760]   You don't come and worship me.
[00:44:42.760 --> 00:44:47.040]   Your sins are starting to pile up, becoming a huge burden, because you refuse to come
[00:44:47.040 --> 00:44:48.040]   and sacrifice.
[00:44:48.040 --> 00:44:53.520]   But what was his answer to this?
[00:44:53.520 --> 00:44:58.160]   Our human logic would say, "Enough!"
[00:44:58.160 --> 00:44:59.800]   Right?
[00:44:59.800 --> 00:45:01.720]   How many times?
[00:45:01.720 --> 00:45:06.400]   How many times does Israel have to go through this cycle before God says, "Enough!"
[00:45:06.400 --> 00:45:07.400]   Right?
[00:45:07.400 --> 00:45:10.680]   You know what the answer is?
[00:45:10.680 --> 00:45:13.000]   Seven times seventy.
[00:45:13.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   Seven times seventy.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:17.200]   So, at the end, what's the ultimate reason?
[00:45:17.200 --> 00:45:18.200]   What does he do?
[00:45:18.200 --> 00:45:21.000]   Because he promises them, "I will blot out your sins."
[00:45:21.000 --> 00:45:23.760]   This burden that he felt for their sins.
[00:45:23.760 --> 00:45:24.760]   Right?
[00:45:24.760 --> 00:45:28.200]   What did he do with that burden?
[00:45:28.200 --> 00:45:30.560]   He placed it upon Christ.
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:31.920]   Right?
[00:45:31.920 --> 00:45:37.040]   This burden that was piling up, despite his grace and mercy.
[00:45:37.040 --> 00:45:38.040]   What did he do with that burden?
[00:45:38.040 --> 00:45:39.280]   He placed it upon Christ.
[00:45:39.280 --> 00:45:47.480]   He who knew no sin became sin, so that we might become the righteousness of God.
[00:45:47.480 --> 00:45:50.080]   Does that motivate you to worship Him?
[00:45:50.080 --> 00:45:51.080]   Right?
[00:45:51.080 --> 00:45:54.600]   Does that make you want to follow Jesus?
[00:45:54.600 --> 00:45:55.600]   Right?
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:56.600]   To proclaim Him?
[00:45:56.600 --> 00:45:57.880]   To honor Him?
[00:45:57.880 --> 00:46:00.280]   Not to disappoint Him?
[00:46:00.280 --> 00:46:02.120]   Right?
[00:46:02.120 --> 00:46:03.840]   I think it does, if we really believe.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:04.840]   Right?
[00:46:04.840 --> 00:46:09.560]   It's just that sometimes, all that we know, sometimes we become so hardened that it just
[00:46:09.560 --> 00:46:12.000]   becomes theology, but not truth.
[00:46:12.000 --> 00:46:17.240]   But when this has flesh, when this is truth, it changes us.
[00:46:17.240 --> 00:46:18.240]   Right?
[00:46:18.240 --> 00:46:19.840]   Because it's very personal.
[00:46:19.840 --> 00:46:22.200]   We're not just talking about some doctrinal statement.
[00:46:22.200 --> 00:46:25.760]   We're talking about this God who loves us.
[00:46:25.760 --> 00:46:27.520]   Right?
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:31.920]   We burdened Him with our sin, and what did He do with that burden?
[00:46:31.920 --> 00:46:35.240]   He took it upon Himself.
[00:46:35.240 --> 00:46:38.920]   So again, true worship is always a response to this.
[00:46:38.920 --> 00:46:40.320]   It's a response to this.
[00:46:40.320 --> 00:46:41.320]   Right?
[00:46:41.320 --> 00:46:42.880]   When we recognize what we have in Christ.
[00:46:42.880 --> 00:46:50.120]   So again, we're not done, but Isaiah is going to just pound it upon us, so that hopefully,
[00:46:50.120 --> 00:46:54.520]   if your hearts have become hardened for whatever the reason, in the last few months, or last
[00:46:54.520 --> 00:47:02.160]   few years, I pray, my hope and prayer is that as we go through these sections of promises
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:06.240]   of the Messiah, the details of the Gospel, you know, hopefully by the time we get to
[00:47:06.240 --> 00:47:10.880]   Isaiah 53, right, revival will break out.
[00:47:10.880 --> 00:47:11.880]   Right?
[00:47:11.880 --> 00:47:12.880]   In our hearts.
[00:47:12.880 --> 00:47:17.440]   That the ultimate reason why we're doing what we're doing is so that when we say, "We love
[00:47:17.440 --> 00:47:19.680]   You, Jesus," that we mean it from our hearts.
[00:47:19.680 --> 00:47:20.680]   Right?
[00:47:20.680 --> 00:47:21.680]   A genuine response.
[00:47:21.680 --> 00:47:23.000]   We love because He first loved us.
[00:47:23.000 --> 00:47:24.000]   Right?
[00:47:24.000 --> 00:47:27.240]   So let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys get into your groups, and take some
[00:47:27.240 --> 00:47:28.240]   time for a small group.
[00:47:28.240 --> 00:47:29.240]   Who's doing snacks today?
[00:47:29.240 --> 00:47:30.240]   Okay.
[00:47:30.240 --> 00:47:31.240]   Who's doing snacks next week?
[00:47:31.240 --> 00:47:32.240]   And Philip's group.
[00:47:32.240 --> 00:47:33.240]   Okay, that group.
[00:47:33.240 --> 00:47:34.240]   Okay.
[00:47:34.240 --> 00:47:43.720]   Alright, let me pray for us, and then I'll let you guys get to your groups.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.800]   Heavenly Father, we thank You so much for being so patient with us.
[00:47:48.800 --> 00:47:52.440]   You know how prone we are to wander and to be entangled.
[00:47:52.440 --> 00:47:59.140]   We look at the rest of the world, and sometimes we envy what they have, because we forget
[00:47:59.140 --> 00:48:03.600]   the hope that we have in Jesus, and what it is that we already have.
[00:48:03.600 --> 00:48:11.460]   The privilege that we have to call You our Abba Father, because You loved us, and You
[00:48:11.460 --> 00:48:14.000]   pursued us.
[00:48:14.000 --> 00:48:20.120]   You were patient with us, and You forgave us, no matter how many times we've drifted.
[00:48:20.120 --> 00:48:26.920]   No matter how many times we've disappointed, because of Your unending grace, we're able
[00:48:26.920 --> 00:48:28.960]   to be here.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:34.920]   I pray, Father God, that You would cause all of us, each one of us, to respond in such
[00:48:34.920 --> 00:48:39.320]   a way that our confession of love to You may be genuine.
[00:48:39.320 --> 00:48:44.200]   That our worship would never be a burden, but it would be an expression of that gratitude,
[00:48:44.200 --> 00:48:46.720]   Lord, that You place in our own hearts.
[00:48:46.720 --> 00:48:52.520]   I pray that our fellowship, our small groups, would lead to greater challenge, greater sharpening,
[00:48:52.520 --> 00:48:54.520]   as iron sharpening iron.
[00:48:54.520 --> 00:48:59.000]   That wherever we are, whatever it is that we have experienced this week, that our burdens
[00:48:59.000 --> 00:49:02.920]   would be unburdened, Lord God, and to place it upon Christ.
[00:49:02.920 --> 00:49:08.280]   And that as You have called Israel to Yourself, that we would go to You, Father God, with
[00:49:08.280 --> 00:49:10.760]   confidence in the blood, in the name of Jesus.
[00:49:10.760 --> 00:49:12.000]   We thank You in Jesus' name we pray.
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:12.500]   Amen.
