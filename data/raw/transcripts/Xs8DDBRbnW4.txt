[00:16:01.700 --> 00:16:05.700]   First of all, the Christmas outreach program
[00:16:05.700 --> 00:16:06.700]   that the sisters are doing,

[00:16:11.700 --> 00:16:13.700]   or go on our Facebook, our website,

[00:16:52.700 --> 00:16:55.700]   about what we are planning to do going forward.
[00:16:55.700 --> 00:16:58.700]   Again, we just wanna clarify,
[00:16:58.700 --> 00:16:59.700]   we're not gonna go into too much detail,
[00:16:59.700 --> 00:17:02.700]   but nothing at the church is really gonna change.
[00:17:02.700 --> 00:17:06.700]   We are, again, this is an essential part
[00:17:06.700 --> 00:17:07.700]   of what it means to be a believer
[00:17:07.700 --> 00:17:09.700]   and to corporately gather together,
[00:17:09.700 --> 00:17:12.700]   and so we're gonna do our best to keep the church safe.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:13.700]   We're gonna do all the sanitation,
[00:17:13.700 --> 00:17:15.700]   ask you guys to keep your masks on,
[00:17:15.700 --> 00:17:18.700]   and the COVID is spreading.
[00:17:18.700 --> 00:17:19.700]   You know, the numbers are going up.
[00:17:19.700 --> 00:17:22.700]   We can actually see that that's what's going on,
[00:17:22.700 --> 00:17:24.700]   so we wanna be as careful as possible,
[00:17:24.700 --> 00:17:27.700]   and we want to encourage you to be responsible
[00:17:27.700 --> 00:17:29.700]   and do as much as you can.
[00:17:29.700 --> 00:17:31.700]   If you are uncomfortable,
[00:17:31.700 --> 00:17:33.700]   you are more than welcome to be outside.
[00:17:33.700 --> 00:17:36.700]   We'll try to set up more chairs outside if we need to,
[00:17:36.700 --> 00:17:37.700]   and so we're gonna try to accommodate that,
[00:17:37.700 --> 00:17:39.700]   but as far as the ministry is concerned,
[00:17:39.700 --> 00:17:41.700]   we're gonna continue what we're doing.
[00:17:41.700 --> 00:17:44.700]   Again, as we said, it is not wise
[00:17:44.700 --> 00:17:47.700]   for the non-believing world to tell us
[00:17:47.700 --> 00:17:49.700]   what is and is not essential,
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:51.700]   to have the entertainment industry
[00:17:51.700 --> 00:17:53.700]   to be declared that it's essential,
[00:17:53.700 --> 00:17:55.700]   to say Planned Parenthood is essential.
[00:17:55.700 --> 00:17:57.700]   There's certain gatherings
[00:17:57.700 --> 00:17:58.700]   that the world think is important,
[00:17:58.700 --> 00:18:00.700]   but because they're non-believers,
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:02.700]   what we are doing is not essential.
[00:18:02.700 --> 00:18:04.700]   So it's understandable that the non-believing world
[00:18:04.700 --> 00:18:07.700]   will say, "Since this is just superstition,
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:09.700]   "this is just for your peace of mind,
[00:18:09.700 --> 00:18:11.700]   "so you guys can handle not having it,"
[00:18:11.700 --> 00:18:14.700]   but we believe that what we are doing
[00:18:14.700 --> 00:18:16.700]   is not only important,
[00:18:16.700 --> 00:18:18.700]   but it is at the core of who we are,
[00:18:18.700 --> 00:18:20.700]   and so we're gonna continue to do what we are doing,
[00:18:20.700 --> 00:18:22.700]   and as things progress,
[00:18:22.700 --> 00:18:24.700]   we're gonna try to do our best
[00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:25.700]   to take care of our church,
[00:18:25.700 --> 00:18:28.700]   but again, as far as the programs and what we're doing,
[00:18:28.700 --> 00:18:30.700]   we're gonna just take more caution,
[00:18:30.700 --> 00:18:32.700]   but as far as what we're doing,
[00:18:32.700 --> 00:18:33.700]   things aren't going to change,
[00:18:33.700 --> 00:18:36.700]   just kind of keeping that in mind, okay?
[00:18:36.700 --> 00:18:38.700]   If you have any further questions on that,
[00:18:38.700 --> 00:18:39.700]   and you want more clarity,
[00:18:39.700 --> 00:18:40.700]   you can come and ask us,
[00:18:40.700 --> 00:18:41.700]   and we'll talk to you directly,
[00:18:41.700 --> 00:18:42.700]   but outside of that,
[00:18:42.700 --> 00:18:44.700]   that's what we're gonna be going,
[00:18:44.700 --> 00:18:46.700]   that's the principle that we're gonna be working toward
[00:18:46.700 --> 00:18:47.700]   as we go forward, okay?
[00:18:47.700 --> 00:18:48.700]   So at this time,
[00:18:48.700 --> 00:18:50.700]   we're gonna take a time of offering.
[00:18:50.700 --> 00:18:52.700]   Again, just give you a minute to do that,
[00:18:52.700 --> 00:18:53.700]   and then physical offering,
[00:18:53.700 --> 00:18:55.700]   box will be in the back.
[00:18:55.700 --> 00:18:56.700]   All right, let's pray.
[00:18:57.700 --> 00:18:59.700]   Heavenly Father,
[00:18:59.700 --> 00:19:01.700]   we want to continue to give you praise
[00:19:01.700 --> 00:19:03.700]   and thanks for who you are.
[00:19:03.700 --> 00:19:06.700]   We pray that in our giving,
[00:19:06.700 --> 00:19:09.700]   that we would give truly as an act of worship.
[00:19:09.700 --> 00:19:13.700]   Help us to be good stewards as leaders in the church.
[00:19:13.700 --> 00:19:15.700]   Help us, Lord God,
[00:19:15.700 --> 00:19:18.700]   to use it in a way that honors and glorifies you.
[00:19:18.700 --> 00:19:22.700]   I pray that those who give may give, Lord God,
[00:19:22.700 --> 00:19:24.700]   trusting in your sovereignty,
[00:19:24.700 --> 00:19:27.700]   that it may be multiplied for your use.
[00:19:27.700 --> 00:19:30.700]   We pray, Father God, that our worship truly,
[00:19:30.700 --> 00:19:32.700]   whether it's financial, whether it's word,
[00:19:32.700 --> 00:19:34.700]   whether it's fellowship,
[00:19:34.700 --> 00:19:36.700]   may be given to you with a cheerful heart,
[00:19:36.700 --> 00:19:38.700]   not grudgingly.
[00:19:38.700 --> 00:19:41.700]   May it be an act of worship that honors and glorifies you.
[00:19:41.700 --> 00:19:43.700]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.

[00:32:35.700 --> 00:32:41.700]   We will hold fast to the anchor.
[00:32:41.700 --> 00:32:45.700]   It shall never be removed.
[00:32:45.700 --> 00:32:50.700]   And now you may be seated.
[00:32:50.700 --> 00:32:58.700]   All right, good morning.
[00:32:58.700 --> 00:33:02.700]   We're going to take a break from the study of Hebrews.
[00:33:02.700 --> 00:33:06.700]   And we're going to be jumping into Philippians chapter 2,
[00:33:06.700 --> 00:33:07.700]   verse 14 to 18.
[00:33:07.700 --> 00:33:13.700]   Philippians chapter 2, verse 14 to 18.
[00:33:13.700 --> 00:33:17.700]   Reading out of the NASB.
[00:33:17.700 --> 00:33:19.700]   Do all things without grumbling or disputing,
[00:33:19.700 --> 00:33:23.700]   so that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent.
[00:33:23.700 --> 00:33:27.700]   Children of God, above reproach in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
[00:33:27.700 --> 00:33:30.700]   among whom you appear as lights in the world,
[00:33:30.700 --> 00:33:33.700]   holding fast the word of life, so that in the day of Christ,
[00:33:33.700 --> 00:33:38.700]   I will have reason to glory, because I did not run in vain, nor toil in vain.
[00:33:38.700 --> 00:33:43.700]   But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering upon the sacrifice and service of your faith,
[00:33:43.700 --> 00:33:46.700]   I rejoice and share my joy with you all.
[00:33:46.700 --> 00:33:50.700]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way and share your joy with me.
[00:33:50.700 --> 00:33:51.700]   Let's pray.
[00:33:51.700 --> 00:33:58.700]   Heavenly Father, we ask for your guidance.
[00:33:58.700 --> 00:34:02.700]   Let your word go forth and nothing else.
[00:34:02.700 --> 00:34:05.700]   Help us, Lord God, to be discerning hearers,
[00:34:05.700 --> 00:34:09.700]   that we would test the scriptures, Lord God,
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:13.700]   and make sure that it is your voice that we hear.
[00:34:13.700 --> 00:34:16.700]   So we pray that you would protect our pulpit,
[00:34:16.700 --> 00:34:18.700]   that you would protect the hearers,
[00:34:18.700 --> 00:34:22.700]   that all that we believe and all that we apply,
[00:34:22.700 --> 00:34:25.700]   that it may be coming with your authority and your word.
[00:34:25.700 --> 00:34:27.700]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:34:28.700 --> 00:34:31.700]   Well, Merry Thanksgiving, everybody.
[00:34:31.700 --> 00:34:36.700]   So, did you know Thanksgiving is this Thursday?
[00:34:36.700 --> 00:34:39.700]   You would never know by what's going on,
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:43.700]   because less and less, every single year we hear less of Thanksgiving.
[00:34:43.700 --> 00:34:45.700]   There's already talks of Christmas.
[00:34:45.700 --> 00:34:49.700]   You know, previous years, Christmas lights and Christmas trees
[00:34:49.700 --> 00:34:51.700]   don't get put up until after Black Friday.
[00:34:51.700 --> 00:34:56.700]   But I've heard more about Black Friday this year than I've done Thanksgiving.
[00:34:56.700 --> 00:34:58.700]   Have you heard of Thanksgiving?
[00:34:58.700 --> 00:35:01.700]   I'm trying to look for who's actually talking about Thanksgiving.
[00:35:01.700 --> 00:35:04.700]   All I've heard is what you can't do on Thanksgiving.
[00:35:04.700 --> 00:35:07.700]   You're not supposed to do this, you're not supposed to do that.
[00:35:07.700 --> 00:35:10.700]   But Thanksgiving is a uniquely Christian holiday,
[00:35:10.700 --> 00:35:13.700]   and I think part of the reason, it may not be all the reason,
[00:35:13.700 --> 00:35:16.700]   but part of the reason why Thanksgiving is kind of slowly dying out
[00:35:16.700 --> 00:35:20.700]   is because I don't think the secular knows what to do with this,
[00:35:20.700 --> 00:35:24.700]   because it's a unique holiday that was set apart for worship,
[00:35:24.700 --> 00:35:27.700]   to give thanks to God for what God has done.
[00:35:27.700 --> 00:35:30.700]   And I think it's important for us as Christians that, again,
[00:35:30.700 --> 00:35:34.700]   not just once a year, but celebrating Thanksgiving is a reminder to us
[00:35:34.700 --> 00:35:39.700]   that this is something that we ought to be doing regularly, all the time.
[00:35:39.700 --> 00:35:43.700]   You know, before we even jump into that, I want to get some stuff off my chest,
[00:35:43.700 --> 00:35:46.700]   because before we get into Thanksgiving, I want to share with you
[00:35:46.700 --> 00:35:49.700]   some of the things that's been bothering me, okay?
[00:35:49.700 --> 00:35:53.700]   Just this week, you know, I got new neighbors.
[00:35:53.700 --> 00:35:56.700]   We're living in a cul-de-sac, and before they moved in,
[00:35:56.700 --> 00:36:00.700]   we had the reign of parking in our cul-de-sac.
[00:36:00.700 --> 00:36:03.700]   And so we're able to park anywhere we want, and then all of a sudden,
[00:36:03.700 --> 00:36:06.700]   this--it looked like some kind of daycare center moved in,
[00:36:06.700 --> 00:36:09.700]   because they got all kinds of cars sitting outside.
[00:36:09.700 --> 00:36:13.700]   Now whenever we park, we have to maneuver with them, you know?
[00:36:13.700 --> 00:36:15.700]   So we have to have a strategy.
[00:36:15.700 --> 00:36:19.700]   When you come home, park your car, and if we park on the street first.
[00:36:19.700 --> 00:36:22.700]   So we're going to dominate this, and then park.
[00:36:22.700 --> 00:36:25.700]   So every time I come out, I check the city, and it's like, "Oh my gosh,
[00:36:25.700 --> 00:36:27.700]   they got like five cars out here," right?
[00:36:27.700 --> 00:36:30.700]   Anyway, I'm getting some of that off my chest.
[00:36:30.700 --> 00:36:32.700]   Ever since the pandemic, some of you guys know,
[00:36:32.700 --> 00:36:36.700]   we live right by the train station, and then behind there's like a walkway.
[00:36:36.700 --> 00:36:40.700]   And usually it's not used well, but ever since the pandemic,
[00:36:40.700 --> 00:36:43.700]   people have been exercising there, hanging out there.
[00:36:43.700 --> 00:36:47.700]   The teenagers are riding their skateboards up and down,
[00:36:47.700 --> 00:36:49.700]   and so it's always busy.
[00:36:49.700 --> 00:36:51.700]   So every morning, I'm doing quiet time reading the Bible,
[00:36:51.700 --> 00:36:54.700]   and I hear them yelling and screaming.
[00:36:54.700 --> 00:36:56.700]   Anyway, I'm getting some of that off my chest, okay?
[00:36:56.700 --> 00:37:00.700]   So this is what's been going on in my life.
[00:37:00.700 --> 00:37:04.700]   You know, this week, I was driving from--
[00:37:04.700 --> 00:37:08.700]   I went to Carl's Jr. to pick a hamburger for lunch,
[00:37:08.700 --> 00:37:13.700]   and I asked them to give me extra lettuce on my Famous Star,
[00:37:13.700 --> 00:37:16.700]   and by the time I got back, instead of giving me extra lettuce,
[00:37:16.700 --> 00:37:20.700]   they gave me a lettuce wrap.
[00:37:20.700 --> 00:37:22.700]   I've never eaten lettuce wrap before.
[00:37:22.700 --> 00:37:26.700]   I was thinking, if I wanted salad, I would have ordered salad, right?
[00:37:26.700 --> 00:37:30.700]   And so that same day, I was coming back from Carl's Jr.,
[00:37:30.700 --> 00:37:34.700]   you know, it was like a right turn right off of coming into,
[00:37:34.700 --> 00:37:36.700]   I think, Red Hill in--what is that?
[00:37:36.700 --> 00:37:40.700]   Red Hill in Maine, and, you know, I'm making a right turn,
[00:37:40.700 --> 00:37:42.700]   but you know one of those people that always like--
[00:37:42.700 --> 00:37:44.700]   they're kind of--they're intending to go straight,
[00:37:44.700 --> 00:37:47.700]   but they park right in the middle?
[00:37:47.700 --> 00:37:48.700]   You know what I'm talking about?
[00:37:48.700 --> 00:37:49.700]   You guys know what I'm talking about.
[00:37:49.700 --> 00:37:51.700]   You know how frustrating that is?
[00:37:51.700 --> 00:37:52.700]   They're not trying to make a right turn.
[00:37:52.700 --> 00:37:54.700]   They're going to go straight, but they're taking up both lanes.
[00:37:54.700 --> 00:37:56.700]   So this guy--I was about to make a right turn,
[00:37:56.700 --> 00:37:58.700]   and then he wouldn't budge.
[00:37:58.700 --> 00:38:01.700]   So I said, "Okay, I'm a pastor, so I better--"
[00:38:01.700 --> 00:38:05.700]   So I just sat there waiting for the red light to turn,
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:08.700]   but he looked, and we made eye contact,
[00:38:08.700 --> 00:38:11.700]   and the first thing I see, his middle finger goes up.
[00:38:11.700 --> 00:38:13.700]   And I said, "What did I do?"
[00:38:13.700 --> 00:38:17.700]   And he said, "Yeah, I don't have a pleasant resting face."
[00:38:17.700 --> 00:38:21.700]   So maybe he looked at me, and he thought I was angry,
[00:38:21.700 --> 00:38:22.700]   and he just flipped me off.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.700]   He's like, "Wow."
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:26.700]   And that's with the lettuce wrap in the car,
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.700]   which I didn't know.
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.700]   And then here's the worst.
[00:38:31.700 --> 00:38:34.700]   So I've been trying to deal with something
[00:38:34.700 --> 00:38:36.700]   that's been going on with Amazon.
[00:38:36.700 --> 00:38:38.700]   They said that I owed back taxes
[00:38:38.700 --> 00:38:40.700]   for something that happened on Amazon,
[00:38:40.700 --> 00:38:42.700]   and so I've been on the phone with them
[00:38:42.700 --> 00:38:45.700]   for the last three days for hours and hours,
[00:38:45.700 --> 00:38:47.700]   and I've talked to them over 10 people,
[00:38:47.700 --> 00:38:49.700]   and I've been trying to contact them through the phone,
[00:38:49.700 --> 00:38:52.700]   through the internet, I've gone to Amazon.com,
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:55.700]   and only time they'd give any kind of response
[00:38:55.700 --> 00:38:57.700]   is if I put something on Amazon.
[00:38:57.700 --> 00:38:59.700]   So I was on the phone that day with Amazon
[00:38:59.700 --> 00:39:02.700]   going back and forth to the callers in India,
[00:39:02.700 --> 00:39:05.700]   to America, back and forth, back and forth,
[00:39:05.700 --> 00:39:07.700]   and then I just was so tired,
[00:39:07.700 --> 00:39:10.700]   and I was on the phone for about two hours,
[00:39:10.700 --> 00:39:12.700]   and during the two hours, there's long breaks in between.
[00:39:12.700 --> 00:39:14.700]   So I said, "Wait a second, let me look this up.
[00:39:14.700 --> 00:39:15.700]   "Let me look this up."
[00:39:15.700 --> 00:39:17.700]   And I've already gone through hours of this,
[00:39:17.700 --> 00:39:19.700]   and this is the ninth or 10th person,
[00:39:19.700 --> 00:39:21.700]   and so as I was grumbling inside,
[00:39:21.700 --> 00:39:25.700]   I was preparing this sermon about not grumbling.
[00:39:25.700 --> 00:39:26.700]   All right?
[00:39:26.700 --> 00:39:28.700]   So I just wanted to get this off my chest
[00:39:28.700 --> 00:39:31.700]   because when I think about Thanksgiving,
[00:39:31.700 --> 00:39:34.700]   it's like, what are you thankful for?
[00:39:34.700 --> 00:39:35.700]   Every year during Thanksgiving,
[00:39:35.700 --> 00:39:37.700]   tell me, what are you thankful for?
[00:39:37.700 --> 00:39:39.700]   Thank you for the family, thank you for this job,
[00:39:39.700 --> 00:39:40.700]   thank you for salvation,
[00:39:40.700 --> 00:39:43.700]   and we have this road thing that we go through.
[00:39:43.700 --> 00:39:45.700]   And I'm like, "Oh, I should be thankful for that."
[00:39:45.700 --> 00:39:48.700]   And they said, "So what's bothering you?"
[00:39:48.700 --> 00:39:51.700]   That's a much easier question to answer.
[00:39:51.700 --> 00:39:52.700]   What's bothering you?
[00:39:52.700 --> 00:39:55.700]   For most people, it doesn't really take long.
[00:39:55.700 --> 00:39:56.700]   We have to force ourselves.
[00:39:56.700 --> 00:39:59.700]   Like, "I'm gonna be thankful, I'm gonna be thankful."
[00:39:59.700 --> 00:40:01.700]   But what's bothering us is like
[00:40:01.700 --> 00:40:04.700]   always sitting at the tip of our tongue,
[00:40:04.700 --> 00:40:06.700]   and the application, right?
[00:40:06.700 --> 00:40:07.700]   We always have to apply,
[00:40:07.700 --> 00:40:08.700]   say, "Oh, I'm gonna be more positive.
[00:40:08.700 --> 00:40:10.700]   "I'm gonna be more thankful."
[00:40:10.700 --> 00:40:14.700]   But our heart condition naturally is to grumble.
[00:40:14.700 --> 00:40:17.700]   Our natural condition is naturally to be grumbled.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:21.700]   Today's sermon is about grumbling, right?
[00:40:21.700 --> 00:40:23.700]   The opposite of Thanksgiving, it's about grumbling.
[00:40:23.700 --> 00:40:26.700]   So I'm gonna be grumbling about grumbling this morning, okay?
[00:40:26.700 --> 00:40:28.700]   So the text that we're looking at,
[00:40:28.700 --> 00:40:29.700]   Apostle Paul is writing,
[00:40:29.700 --> 00:40:32.700]   even though he's writing this letter of joy,
[00:40:32.700 --> 00:40:35.700]   if you study Philippians well enough,
[00:40:35.700 --> 00:40:36.700]   you know that at the end of Philippians,
[00:40:36.700 --> 00:40:38.700]   he's asking because there's a division
[00:40:38.700 --> 00:40:41.700]   that's taking place between these two prominent sisters.
[00:40:41.700 --> 00:40:44.700]   Say, "Hey, can you guys please help them out?"
[00:40:44.700 --> 00:40:47.700]   And obviously that theme of division in this church,
[00:40:47.700 --> 00:40:50.700]   if you restudy the book of Philippians,
[00:40:50.700 --> 00:40:53.700]   even though there's a larger theme of rejoicing the Lord,
[00:40:53.700 --> 00:40:55.700]   but the reason why he keeps reminding them to rejoice
[00:40:55.700 --> 00:40:57.700]   is because there's an underlying division
[00:40:57.700 --> 00:41:00.700]   that's taking place in the church.
[00:41:00.700 --> 00:41:02.700]   And if you go back and study Philippians,
[00:41:02.700 --> 00:41:06.700]   you'll see that that's kind of what he's touching upon,
[00:41:06.700 --> 00:41:08.700]   and then he brings the main point at the end.
[00:41:08.700 --> 00:41:10.700]   "Please help these sisters to get along."
[00:41:10.700 --> 00:41:12.700]   That's why he writes Philippians chapter one,
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.700]   chapter two, "Don't be selfish.
[00:41:14.700 --> 00:41:15.700]   "Look up for other people.
[00:41:15.700 --> 00:41:17.700]   "Consider them better than yourselves
[00:41:17.700 --> 00:41:18.700]   "and have the attitude of Jesus."
[00:41:18.700 --> 00:41:21.700]   All that is written, not randomly,
[00:41:21.700 --> 00:41:24.700]   just so that we can understand Christianity,
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:27.700]   is because there was an underlying division
[00:41:27.700 --> 00:41:29.700]   taking place in the church.
[00:41:29.700 --> 00:41:32.700]   And it is in that context, after he says,
[00:41:32.700 --> 00:41:34.700]   "Look at the example of Jesus Christ,"
[00:41:34.700 --> 00:41:36.700]   and then he says in verse 14,
[00:41:36.700 --> 00:41:39.700]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing."
[00:41:39.700 --> 00:41:41.700]   And the reason why he's saying that
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:43.700]   is because that was the underlying reason
[00:41:43.700 --> 00:41:46.700]   why there was division in the church.
[00:41:46.700 --> 00:41:48.700]   "Do all things without grumbling or disputing."
[00:41:48.700 --> 00:41:53.700]   The word for grumbling, another word is murmuring.
[00:41:53.700 --> 00:41:57.700]   All the times grumbling is just, "Ugh!"
[00:41:57.700 --> 00:41:58.700]   You know, you don't like something,
[00:41:58.700 --> 00:41:59.700]   and if you're an extrovert,
[00:41:59.700 --> 00:42:01.700]   you'll articulate what you don't like.
[00:42:01.700 --> 00:42:02.700]   "I don't like this 'cause of that.
[00:42:02.700 --> 00:42:03.700]   "I don't like this 'cause of that."
[00:42:03.700 --> 00:42:06.700]   If you're an introvert, there's, "Ugh!"
[00:42:06.700 --> 00:42:07.700]   Right?
[00:42:07.700 --> 00:42:09.700]   And that's the sound that you hear internally.
[00:42:09.700 --> 00:42:11.700]   "Ugh!"
[00:42:11.700 --> 00:42:14.700]   You don't like something, it's, "Hmm."
[00:42:14.700 --> 00:42:16.700]   So that's what this means.
[00:42:16.700 --> 00:42:17.700]   "Do not grumble or murmur."
[00:42:17.700 --> 00:42:19.700]   1 Peter 4:9,
[00:42:19.700 --> 00:42:23.700]   "Be hospitable to one another without complaint."
[00:42:23.700 --> 00:42:24.700]   Right?
[00:42:24.700 --> 00:42:27.700]   If you're complaining, why would you be hospitable?
[00:42:27.700 --> 00:42:29.700]   See, he's talking about Christians
[00:42:29.700 --> 00:42:31.700]   who are trying to live their Christian life,
[00:42:31.700 --> 00:42:34.700]   but they're doing it grudgingly.
[00:42:34.700 --> 00:42:37.700]   That's why he says, "Be hospitable without complaining."
[00:42:37.700 --> 00:42:41.700]   Do what you're supposed to do without murmuring.
[00:42:41.700 --> 00:42:44.700]   Israelites, the 40 years out in the desert,
[00:42:44.700 --> 00:42:46.700]   if there's one characteristic about the Israelites
[00:42:46.700 --> 00:42:49.700]   that's highlighted, is their grumbling.
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:52.700]   They had problems with idolatry.
[00:42:52.700 --> 00:42:54.700]   They had all kinds of problems during the 40 years.
[00:42:54.700 --> 00:42:57.700]   In fact, they got into, one tribe, the Simeonites,
[00:42:57.700 --> 00:43:00.700]   got into idolatry and sexual immorality.
[00:43:00.700 --> 00:43:02.700]   The half of their tribes get wiped out
[00:43:02.700 --> 00:43:05.700]   out of judgment of God.
[00:43:05.700 --> 00:43:08.700]   But instead, the primary sin that is pointed out
[00:43:08.700 --> 00:43:10.700]   in 1 Corinthians 10, 10-11,
[00:43:10.700 --> 00:43:13.700]   is that they were constantly grumbling.
[00:43:13.700 --> 00:43:17.700]   And it was their grumbling that led to the judgment of God.
[00:43:17.700 --> 00:43:19.700]   When we think about grumbling,
[00:43:19.700 --> 00:43:22.700]   usually if we have all the list of sins
[00:43:22.700 --> 00:43:23.700]   that we should be concerned about,
[00:43:23.700 --> 00:43:26.700]   sexual immorality, murder, slander,
[00:43:26.700 --> 00:43:29.700]   you've got a bunch of things that we would think,
[00:43:29.700 --> 00:43:30.700]   like these are highlighted,
[00:43:30.700 --> 00:43:33.700]   we wouldn't think murmuring or grumbling
[00:43:33.700 --> 00:43:35.700]   to be one of those things that we should put
[00:43:35.700 --> 00:43:37.700]   on the top of the list.
[00:43:37.700 --> 00:43:39.700]   Yet, when the Bible warns us about
[00:43:39.700 --> 00:43:42.700]   why the judgment came to the nation of Israel,
[00:43:42.700 --> 00:43:44.700]   one of the primary sins that he points out
[00:43:44.700 --> 00:43:47.700]   is that they were constantly grumbling.
[00:43:47.700 --> 00:43:51.700]   In fact, the history of Israel starts with them grumbling.
[00:43:51.700 --> 00:43:54.700]   Where is God? Why they were enslaved.
[00:43:54.700 --> 00:43:56.700]   And they were crying out, and God had mercy on them.
[00:43:56.700 --> 00:43:58.700]   So he sends Moses.
[00:43:58.700 --> 00:44:01.700]   Moses challenges Pharaoh with the miracles,
[00:44:01.700 --> 00:44:04.700]   and because of that, Moses doesn't immediately respond.
[00:44:04.700 --> 00:44:06.700]   And so he makes it even harder for the slaves.
[00:44:06.700 --> 00:44:09.700]   And they start murmuring and grumbling about that.
[00:44:09.700 --> 00:44:11.700]   When God delivers them and takes them to the Red Sea,
[00:44:11.700 --> 00:44:12.700]   it's like, "Whoa, we're trapped.
[00:44:12.700 --> 00:44:15.700]   "Why did he do all of that to bring us out here to kill us?"
[00:44:15.700 --> 00:44:16.700]   And they started grumbling.
[00:44:16.700 --> 00:44:18.700]   So God opens up the sea, and they go to the other side,
[00:44:18.700 --> 00:44:19.700]   they sing and celebrate.
[00:44:19.700 --> 00:44:21.700]   As soon as they get to the other side,
[00:44:21.700 --> 00:44:22.700]   Moses goes up to the mountain.
[00:44:22.700 --> 00:44:24.700]   How come he's taking so long?
[00:44:24.700 --> 00:44:26.700]   He came out here to abandon us?
[00:44:26.700 --> 00:44:29.700]   So they make the golden calf, they start worshiping God,
[00:44:29.700 --> 00:44:31.700]   divides the whole community in half.
[00:44:31.700 --> 00:44:34.700]   And then you would think they learned their lesson.
[00:44:34.700 --> 00:44:37.700]   Soon after--we're talking about days--
[00:44:37.700 --> 00:44:39.700]   they walk out into the desert.
[00:44:39.700 --> 00:44:41.700]   It's like, "I'm so thirsty.
[00:44:41.700 --> 00:44:44.700]   "Why did he bring us out here so that we could die of thirst?"
[00:44:44.700 --> 00:44:46.700]   So they start grumbling.
[00:44:46.700 --> 00:44:48.700]   And then so God gives them water,
[00:44:48.700 --> 00:44:50.700]   and then they move out a little bit further.
[00:44:50.700 --> 00:44:52.700]   It's like, "That's it? Water? What about food?
[00:44:52.700 --> 00:44:55.700]   "We're going to die out here."
[00:44:55.700 --> 00:44:58.700]   So God gives them miraculous bread, manna, from heaven,
[00:44:58.700 --> 00:45:00.700]   literally falling down from heaven.
[00:45:00.700 --> 00:45:03.700]   And they start eating that, and then soon after that,
[00:45:03.700 --> 00:45:05.700]   they're like, "That's it? Bread?
[00:45:05.700 --> 00:45:08.700]   "What about some protein?"
[00:45:08.700 --> 00:45:10.700]   And they start murmuring and complaining about that.
[00:45:10.700 --> 00:45:12.700]   So God gives them quail.
[00:45:12.700 --> 00:45:15.700]   Then after that, it's like, "Okay, we got meat, we got bread,
[00:45:15.700 --> 00:45:18.700]   "we got miraculous water, right?
[00:45:18.700 --> 00:45:20.700]   "And God's in our midst."
[00:45:20.700 --> 00:45:24.700]   And this cycle happened all along the 40 years,
[00:45:24.700 --> 00:45:28.700]   constantly grumbling and complaining.
[00:45:28.700 --> 00:45:31.700]   And the Bible teaches us that that was at the root
[00:45:31.700 --> 00:45:34.700]   of what caused them to seek idleship.
[00:45:34.700 --> 00:45:36.700]   That's a word.
[00:45:36.700 --> 00:45:40.700]   It's the constant grumbling and complaining and murmuring
[00:45:40.700 --> 00:45:43.700]   that caused them to be discontent and covet
[00:45:43.700 --> 00:45:47.700]   what other people had that leads to other sins.
[00:45:47.700 --> 00:45:49.700]   And the Bible says the reason why there's murder
[00:45:49.700 --> 00:45:52.700]   is because there's coveting, and because the coveting
[00:45:52.700 --> 00:45:54.700]   comes from murmuring,
[00:45:54.700 --> 00:45:57.700]   because they're constantly discontent.
[00:45:57.700 --> 00:46:01.700]   In Proverbs 23, 6-7, "Do not eat the bread of a selfish man
[00:46:01.700 --> 00:46:06.700]   "or desire his delicacy," even when he's being generous.
[00:46:06.700 --> 00:46:10.700]   He says, "For as he thinks within himself, so he is."
[00:46:10.700 --> 00:46:14.700]   He says to you, "Eat and drink, but his heart is not with you.
[00:46:14.700 --> 00:46:17.700]   "You will vomit up the more so you have eaten
[00:46:17.700 --> 00:46:19.700]   "and waste your compliments."
[00:46:19.700 --> 00:46:21.700]   He said even if a man who is constantly grumbling
[00:46:21.700 --> 00:46:23.700]   in his heart, he has a selfishness in his heart,
[00:46:23.700 --> 00:46:26.700]   and even when he is being generous, he said, "Don't eat it."
[00:46:26.700 --> 00:46:28.700]   Because that's not really a gift.
[00:46:28.700 --> 00:46:31.700]   It's going to turn out where you're going to end up vomiting.
[00:46:31.700 --> 00:46:34.700]   So when an individual is constantly murmuring
[00:46:34.700 --> 00:46:38.700]   and complaining, it rises up to other sins.
[00:46:38.700 --> 00:46:41.700]   Even his generosity says to question that.
[00:46:41.700 --> 00:46:45.700]   See, an individual who is constantly murmuring,
[00:46:45.700 --> 00:46:48.700]   it leads to disputing.
[00:46:48.700 --> 00:46:51.700]   The word disputing in NIV is questioning, dialoguing.
[00:46:51.700 --> 00:46:53.700]   That's a literal word for that.
[00:46:53.700 --> 00:46:58.700]   Where an individual who is constantly discontent
[00:46:58.700 --> 00:47:00.700]   begins to question everything, and there's a difference
[00:47:00.700 --> 00:47:03.700]   between asking questions and questioning.
[00:47:03.700 --> 00:47:05.700]   Asking questions is trying to figure out what is going on,
[00:47:05.700 --> 00:47:07.700]   why is this happening, versus questioning is,
[00:47:07.700 --> 00:47:12.700]   I know what's right, why are you doing it that way?
[00:47:12.700 --> 00:47:15.700]   And when an individual is constantly questioning,
[00:47:15.700 --> 00:47:18.700]   there is no real answer unless you submit to me.
[00:47:18.700 --> 00:47:21.700]   In Psalm 1 verse 1 it says, "How blessed is the man
[00:47:21.700 --> 00:47:24.700]   who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked,
[00:47:24.700 --> 00:47:28.700]   nor stand in the path of sinners, nor sit in the seat of scoffers."
[00:47:28.700 --> 00:47:31.700]   Do you notice how he says an individual who is walking
[00:47:31.700 --> 00:47:34.700]   according to the principles of this world,
[00:47:34.700 --> 00:47:36.700]   he will eventually be identified with the sinners,
[00:47:36.700 --> 00:47:38.700]   stand in the way of sinners, and then he will seat
[00:47:38.700 --> 00:47:42.700]   in the seat of scoffers, who is constantly questioning,
[00:47:42.700 --> 00:47:45.700]   murmuring, questioning.
[00:47:45.700 --> 00:47:49.700]   In Isaiah 49 verse 5, this constantly murmuring
[00:47:49.700 --> 00:47:52.700]   and questioning eventually rises up to God,
[00:47:52.700 --> 00:47:55.700]   because your circumstance, ultimately God is sovereign.
[00:47:55.700 --> 00:47:59.700]   So if God is sovereign, why is he allowing this to happen?
[00:47:59.700 --> 00:48:01.700]   Why are they the way that they are?
[00:48:01.700 --> 00:48:03.700]   How come these things are happening,
[00:48:03.700 --> 00:48:06.700]   and when we begin to question that, who are we questioning?
[00:48:06.700 --> 00:48:09.700]   The only person who has any control over that,
[00:48:09.700 --> 00:48:11.700]   and it eventually rises up to God.
[00:48:11.700 --> 00:48:15.700]   Isaiah 45 verse 9, "Woe to the one who quarrels with his maker,
[00:48:15.700 --> 00:48:18.700]   and earthenware, vessel among the vessels of earth.
[00:48:18.700 --> 00:48:22.700]   Will the clay say to the potter, 'What are you doing?'
[00:48:22.700 --> 00:48:26.700]   Or the thing you are making say, 'He has no hands.'"
[00:48:26.700 --> 00:48:29.700]   Much of the complaining and murmuring that happens
[00:48:29.700 --> 00:48:32.700]   in our heart is ultimately questioning,
[00:48:32.700 --> 00:48:35.700]   why is God doing this?
[00:48:35.700 --> 00:48:37.700]   Why did God allow this?
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:40.700]   Why did God put that guy in my life, or this person in my life?
[00:48:40.700 --> 00:48:42.700]   Why is he doing this?
[00:48:42.700 --> 00:48:45.700]   Because we don't understand.
[00:48:45.700 --> 00:48:48.700]   So therefore, we're not asking, we're questioning.
[00:48:48.700 --> 00:48:53.700]   Sinclair Ferguson, a professor at Westminster Seminary, says this,
[00:48:53.700 --> 00:48:56.700]   "A complaining or arguing spirit is an expression
[00:48:56.700 --> 00:49:01.700]   of ingratitude to God's providence."
[00:49:01.700 --> 00:49:07.700]   Everybody knows how to be happy when God does what we want.
[00:49:07.700 --> 00:49:10.700]   I want this, I want that, and when he answers my prayer,
[00:49:10.700 --> 00:49:12.700]   God is awesome, he's great.
[00:49:12.700 --> 00:49:16.700]   But when it doesn't fit what we think has to happen,
[00:49:16.700 --> 00:49:20.700]   he says it's an expression of ingratitude toward God's providence,
[00:49:20.700 --> 00:49:24.700]   and lovelessness and pride toward others.
[00:49:24.700 --> 00:49:26.700]   It is a denial of grace.
[00:49:26.700 --> 00:49:29.700]   It is working against salvation, rather than working salvation
[00:49:29.700 --> 00:49:32.700]   in the aspect of our lives.
[00:49:32.700 --> 00:49:33.700]   He said all of this.
[00:49:33.700 --> 00:49:37.700]   Again, we wouldn't normally think of murmuring and asking questions
[00:49:37.700 --> 00:49:41.700]   and disputing as a rebellion against God.
[00:49:41.700 --> 00:49:45.700]   But the Bible says that when we question the providence of God,
[00:49:45.700 --> 00:49:46.700]   that's exactly what we're doing.
[00:49:46.700 --> 00:49:49.700]   It rises up, ultimately, to question God.
[00:49:49.700 --> 00:49:52.700]   Why are you doing this?
[00:49:52.700 --> 00:49:55.700]   Even when God asked Adam, "Why did you do that?"
[00:49:55.700 --> 00:49:58.700]   He said, "Well, why did you put the woman here?"
[00:49:58.700 --> 00:50:03.700]   So ultimately, it's your fault.
[00:50:03.700 --> 00:50:08.700]   He says we ought not to do anything without grumbling or disputing.
[00:50:08.700 --> 00:50:12.700]   Because ultimately, that's what identifies as a Christian.
[00:50:12.700 --> 00:50:20.700]   Thanksgiving, thankfulness, is exactly what you and I have been called to be.
[00:50:20.700 --> 00:50:25.700]   In verse 15, he says, "So that you will prove yourselves to be blameless and innocent,
[00:50:25.700 --> 00:50:29.700]   children of God, above reproach, in the midst of a crooked and perverse generation,
[00:50:29.700 --> 00:50:33.700]   among whom you appear as lights in the world."
[00:50:33.700 --> 00:50:37.700]   The Bible describes our rebellion against God as not acknowledging Him
[00:50:37.700 --> 00:50:39.700]   or giving thanks as our Creator.
[00:50:39.700 --> 00:50:42.700]   In Romans 1:21, "For even though they knew God,
[00:50:42.700 --> 00:50:47.700]   they did not honor Him as God or give thanks.
[00:50:47.700 --> 00:50:52.700]   But they became futile in their speculations, and foolish heart was darkened.
[00:50:52.700 --> 00:50:55.700]   And professing to be wise, they became fools.
[00:50:55.700 --> 00:50:59.700]   Exchange the glory of the incorruptible God and an image in the form of corruptible men
[00:50:59.700 --> 00:51:02.700]   and of birds and of four-footed animals and crawling creatures."
[00:51:02.700 --> 00:51:08.700]   You notice here that the downward spiral of mankind's rebellion
[00:51:08.700 --> 00:51:15.700]   begins by not acknowledging and honoring God or giving thanks.
[00:51:15.700 --> 00:51:21.700]   They chose to give thanks to the Creator rather than the Creator.
[00:51:21.700 --> 00:51:25.700]   You know, oftentimes when the Bible introduces God,
[00:51:25.700 --> 00:51:29.700]   they don't start with "He saved us."
[00:51:29.700 --> 00:51:33.700]   Usually when God is introduced, He's introduced as our Creator.
[00:51:33.700 --> 00:51:39.700]   So even before we get to the cross, the fact that He created us,
[00:51:39.700 --> 00:51:42.700]   our natural relationship between the creation and the Creator
[00:51:42.700 --> 00:51:45.700]   is to acknowledge our Creator and to give thanks to Him.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:50.700]   Even before we get to the cross, the cross is that that Creator
[00:51:50.700 --> 00:51:54.700]   that gave us breath, the very reason why you and I are here.
[00:51:54.700 --> 00:52:00.700]   You and I are even able to think and have conversation that Yahweh is our Creator.
[00:52:00.700 --> 00:52:07.700]   And that Creator happens to love us and gave His only begotten Son.
[00:52:07.700 --> 00:52:10.700]   So He says everything that we need to know,
[00:52:10.700 --> 00:52:13.700]   He revealed Himself as the Creator has been given to us,
[00:52:13.700 --> 00:52:18.700]   and mankind rather worship the creation rather than the Creator.
[00:52:18.700 --> 00:52:20.700]   And as a result of that, what happened?
[00:52:20.700 --> 00:52:22.700]   They became futile in their speculation.
[00:52:22.700 --> 00:52:27.700]   Speculation meaning their thinking, in their contemplation.
[00:52:27.700 --> 00:52:32.700]   Because when an individual has a heart that is murmuring and grumbling and complaining,
[00:52:32.700 --> 00:52:35.700]   he says it affects the way that they think.
[00:52:35.700 --> 00:52:38.700]   Their whole perspective is affected.
[00:52:38.700 --> 00:52:41.700]   And their foolish heart became darkened.
[00:52:41.700 --> 00:52:45.700]   Because of their wrong thinking, their hearts became darkened.
[00:52:45.700 --> 00:52:48.700]   They professed to be wise, but they became fools.
[00:52:48.700 --> 00:52:51.700]   You ever meet somebody who is constantly murmuring and complaining,
[00:52:51.700 --> 00:52:55.700]   and their primary thing is that you don't know.
[00:52:55.700 --> 00:52:58.700]   You don't know what I know. You don't think the way I think.
[00:52:58.700 --> 00:53:01.700]   Well, the Bible says the reason why people don't think the way you think
[00:53:01.700 --> 00:53:05.700]   may be because in your constant murmuring and grumbling,
[00:53:05.700 --> 00:53:10.700]   just as the Scripture says, it has affected your perspective.
[00:53:10.700 --> 00:53:13.700]   And your perspective has affected your heart.
[00:53:13.700 --> 00:53:17.700]   And because your heart was darkened and your speculation had become futile,
[00:53:17.700 --> 00:53:21.700]   it says you think you're wise because you know something that other people don't know,
[00:53:21.700 --> 00:53:24.700]   but in reality, you're the one who became a fool.
[00:53:24.700 --> 00:53:32.700]   And it is that all of this downward spiral came because you refused to acknowledge and give thanks to God.
[00:53:32.700 --> 00:53:37.700]   If you want to fit into this world, just be a good grumbler.
[00:53:37.700 --> 00:53:39.700]   If you want to really fit in, right?
[00:53:39.700 --> 00:53:44.700]   Because the world is more united on things that they hate.
[00:53:44.700 --> 00:53:47.700]   You know, we try to have fellowships like what we love,
[00:53:47.700 --> 00:53:51.700]   but you want to see a tight-knit group who's passionate about something?
[00:53:51.700 --> 00:53:54.700]   It's usually about what they hate.
[00:53:54.700 --> 00:54:01.700]   You say, "I hate the Republicans. I hate the Democrats. I hate them.
[00:54:01.700 --> 00:54:08.700]   I hate these people. You too? Oh yeah, you too?"
[00:54:08.700 --> 00:54:10.700]   The world is united by what they hate.
[00:54:10.700 --> 00:54:16.700]   If you have a full-time job, you know, I don't know if you go to water coolers,
[00:54:16.700 --> 00:54:21.700]   I don't know if they have that anymore, or boba shops, wherever you go to congregate, right?
[00:54:21.700 --> 00:54:26.700]   If you want to fit in, just tell them everything that's bothering you.
[00:54:26.700 --> 00:54:30.700]   "Your boss is unfair. You know, the government."
[00:54:30.700 --> 00:54:34.700]   I mean, just start talking about what's bothering you.
[00:54:34.700 --> 00:54:40.700]   Soon enough, people will join in. It's like, "Oh, you too? You too? You too?"
[00:54:40.700 --> 00:54:43.700]   And then you have these people who hate this group on one side,
[00:54:43.700 --> 00:54:45.700]   the other group who hates the other group on the other side,
[00:54:45.700 --> 00:54:51.700]   and then they hate each other, and you sense fellowship.
[00:54:51.700 --> 00:54:53.700]   Because you feel connected.
[00:54:53.700 --> 00:54:58.700]   And the way that you're connected is the things that you hate.
[00:54:58.700 --> 00:55:00.700]   That's how the world functions.
[00:55:00.700 --> 00:55:03.700]   If you want to fit in, keep grumbling, keep complaining.
[00:55:03.700 --> 00:55:07.700]   Let that be the primary thing that you talk about.
[00:55:07.700 --> 00:55:12.700]   But he says we are to be light. Our very identity as a Christian,
[00:55:12.700 --> 00:55:15.700]   he calls us to be a light in this dark world.
[00:55:15.700 --> 00:55:21.700]   Because the world is in rebellion against God, constantly grumbling and complaining
[00:55:21.700 --> 00:55:25.700]   about God, about the world, about politics, about everything.
[00:55:25.700 --> 00:55:31.700]   And yet, there's no Thanksgiving, because at the root of what it means to be a Christian
[00:55:31.700 --> 00:55:36.700]   is to give worship. And at the heart of a person who worships is a thankful heart.
[00:55:36.700 --> 00:55:42.700]   In Matthew 5, 14-16, "You are the light of the world. The city set on a hill cannot be hidden.
[00:55:42.700 --> 00:55:46.700]   Nor does anyone light a lamp and put it under a basket, but on a lampstand,
[00:55:46.700 --> 00:55:49.700]   and it gives light to all who are in the house.
[00:55:49.700 --> 00:55:52.700]   Let your light shine before men in such a way that they may see your good works
[00:55:52.700 --> 00:55:57.700]   and glorify your Father who is in heaven."
[00:55:57.700 --> 00:56:01.700]   God said we are the light, and the purpose of why he put us to light is so that in darkness
[00:56:01.700 --> 00:56:06.700]   he may put us on a pedestal and say, "That's what God intended, to give glory to God."
[00:56:06.700 --> 00:56:10.700]   Imagine if we were the light and we sat on the table, and the whole time we're talking about is,
[00:56:10.700 --> 00:56:16.700]   "Those guys suck! They suck, and those people suck, and those people suck too!
[00:56:16.700 --> 00:56:19.700]   And then they suck, and they suck, and then what about these guys?
[00:56:19.700 --> 00:56:26.700]   These guys suck, and they suck too! Believe Jesus with me!"
[00:56:26.700 --> 00:56:32.700]   He says we were made to be the light to give glory to God,
[00:56:32.700 --> 00:56:36.700]   to declare His glory and who He is and what He has done.
[00:56:36.700 --> 00:56:41.700]   And that's why he says as Christians, as a light,
[00:56:41.700 --> 00:56:46.700]   our primary thing that we are to declare to the world is of who He is,
[00:56:46.700 --> 00:56:50.700]   not what the world is not.
[00:56:50.700 --> 00:56:54.700]   2 Corinthians 4, 15, "For all things are for your sake,
[00:56:54.700 --> 00:57:00.700]   so that the grace which is spreading to more and more people may cause the giving thanks to abound to the glory of God."
[00:57:00.700 --> 00:57:04.700]   Look what Paul says. Paul says the gospel is continuing to go out.
[00:57:04.700 --> 00:57:06.700]   More and more people are converting. For what purpose?
[00:57:06.700 --> 00:57:13.700]   "So that more people may cause the giving of thanks to abound to the glory of God."
[00:57:13.700 --> 00:57:19.700]   So he describes conversion as people who were not thankful to be thankful,
[00:57:19.700 --> 00:57:22.700]   to have thanksgiving in their heart to give glory to God.
[00:57:22.700 --> 00:57:27.700]   If you have a murmuring heart, we're not saying that we should never ask questions,
[00:57:27.700 --> 00:57:30.700]   that we should never have disagreements. That's not what he's saying.
[00:57:30.700 --> 00:57:34.700]   He's talking about a spirit of constantly murmuring.
[00:57:34.700 --> 00:57:37.700]   [Murmuring]
[00:57:37.700 --> 00:57:41.700]   That's the sound. That's the secret sound of a complainer.
[00:57:41.700 --> 00:57:44.700]   Because that's what I hear behind this thing.
[00:57:44.700 --> 00:57:46.700]   I have extra ears.
[00:57:46.700 --> 00:57:49.700]   [Murmuring]
[00:57:49.700 --> 00:57:52.700]   I'll give you an announcement, and I can look at your faces.
[00:57:52.700 --> 00:57:55.700]   Some of you guys are like, "Huh? What's going on?"
[00:57:55.700 --> 00:57:57.700]   I see some of your faces. "Mmmmmmm."
[00:57:57.700 --> 00:58:05.700]   I see it. I may be wrong, but there's constant murmuring.
[00:58:05.700 --> 00:58:10.700]   And he says as Christians, our core being of who we are is to give thanks.
[00:58:10.700 --> 00:58:15.700]   You cannot give thanks. You cannot spend all week just murmuring, complaining,
[00:58:15.700 --> 00:58:18.700]   talking about what's wrong, and then come into worship and say,
[00:58:18.700 --> 00:58:21.700]   "You're so good, God."
[00:58:21.700 --> 00:58:24.700]   You may be saying that, but internally you're saying,
[00:58:24.700 --> 00:58:26.700]   "What's wrong with them?"
[00:58:26.700 --> 00:58:29.700]   That's actually what's going on in your head and your heart.
[00:58:29.700 --> 00:58:33.700]   "What's wrong with these people, Lord?"
[00:58:33.700 --> 00:58:39.700]   At the core of who we are, people who refuse to acknowledge God and give thanks,
[00:58:39.700 --> 00:58:45.700]   that he made us worshipers of God, because he fills our hearts with no other response,
[00:58:45.700 --> 00:58:50.700]   no other logical response, than to give our lives as a living sacrifice.
[00:58:50.700 --> 00:58:54.700]   It's a reasonable act of worship.
[00:58:54.700 --> 00:59:02.700]   But he also says, "If I just said, 'Stop it,' we'd all leave kind of frustrated."
[00:59:02.700 --> 00:59:07.700]   Well, how do we do that? If our natural instinct is to grumble.
[00:59:07.700 --> 00:59:11.700]   I gave you a short list of things that I was struggling with this week.
[00:59:11.700 --> 00:59:18.700]   I could probably fill that page with about three or four pages of problems.
[00:59:18.700 --> 00:59:20.700]   Because it's natural.
[00:59:20.700 --> 00:59:23.700]   If you guys have Thanksgiving dinner, you might sit around and talk about,
[00:59:23.700 --> 00:59:25.700]   "What are you thankful for?"
[00:59:25.700 --> 00:59:28.700]   And then you're just like, "Hmm."
[00:59:28.700 --> 00:59:32.700]   Not just this rote answer, "I'm thankful for my parents."
[00:59:32.700 --> 00:59:35.700]   I'm thankful for what you're really thankful for.
[00:59:35.700 --> 00:59:38.700]   You kind of have to take some time to actually think through.
[00:59:38.700 --> 00:59:42.700]   What's bothering you? How much time you got?
[00:59:42.700 --> 00:59:46.700]   Because that's our natural state. So if we just say, "Hey, stop it!"
[00:59:46.700 --> 00:59:50.700]   We'd leave thinking, "Oh, that was good. Thank you for reminding me."
[00:59:50.700 --> 00:59:54.700]   But then to actually practice that, starting from lunch,
[00:59:54.700 --> 00:59:57.700]   you're going to start feeling guilty.
[00:59:57.700 --> 01:00:00.700]   Until next Thanksgiving, you say, "Hey, stop it!"
[01:00:00.700 --> 01:00:04.700]   Well, he's very practical. He says, "Well, not doing that."
[01:00:04.700 --> 01:00:08.700]   And verse 16, "Holding fast the word of life."
[01:00:08.700 --> 01:00:11.700]   "Holding fast, so that in the day of Christ I will have reason to glory,
[01:00:11.700 --> 01:00:14.700]   because I did not run in vain, nor toil in vain."
[01:00:14.700 --> 01:00:17.700]   What does it mean to hold fast the word of life?
[01:00:17.700 --> 01:00:21.700]   If he doesn't want us to grumble and complain, then that's our natural response.
[01:00:21.700 --> 01:00:24.700]   And the remedy for that is to hold fast the word of life.
[01:00:24.700 --> 01:00:26.700]   1 Corinthians 15, 1-3,
[01:00:26.700 --> 01:00:30.700]   "Now I make known to you, brethren, the gospel which I preach to you,
[01:00:30.700 --> 01:00:34.700]   which also you received, in which also you stand."
[01:00:34.700 --> 01:00:36.700]   Not only does the gospel justify you,
[01:00:36.700 --> 01:00:39.700]   the gospel is the reason why you're able to stand and be sanctified.
[01:00:39.700 --> 01:00:44.700]   "By which you also are saved, if you hold fast the word which I preach to you,
[01:00:44.700 --> 01:00:49.700]   that you don't drift from that, unless you believed in vain.
[01:00:49.700 --> 01:00:53.700]   For I delivered to you, as of first importance, what I also received,
[01:00:53.700 --> 01:00:56.700]   that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures."
[01:00:56.700 --> 01:01:02.700]   What he is saying is to hold fast to the gospel that you first believed.
[01:01:02.700 --> 01:01:08.700]   And not just to say, "Well, you know what? I was justified, and tell me something more deep."
[01:01:08.700 --> 01:01:10.700]   You know our communion table?
[01:01:10.700 --> 01:01:14.700]   Jesus, very last activity that he had before he went to pray with them,
[01:01:14.700 --> 01:01:17.700]   he says, "Do this in remembrance of me."
[01:01:17.700 --> 01:01:20.700]   And in different places they have different words.
[01:01:20.700 --> 01:01:24.700]   You have the Lord's table, you have the sacrament, you have communion.
[01:01:24.700 --> 01:01:28.700]   But one of the words that is used for the Lord's table is "Eucharist."
[01:01:28.700 --> 01:01:30.700]   Some of you guys may have heard that before.
[01:01:30.700 --> 01:01:35.700]   The Eucharist is literally the word in Greek, "Euchariste,"
[01:01:35.700 --> 01:01:38.700]   which means "giving thanks."
[01:01:38.700 --> 01:01:41.700]   So part of the core meaning of the communion table
[01:01:41.700 --> 01:01:46.700]   is to come and when we receive the elements, to give thanks.
[01:01:46.700 --> 01:01:49.700]   And that's exactly what Paul is trying to get at.
[01:01:49.700 --> 01:01:53.700]   The reason why there is constant murmuring and questioning
[01:01:53.700 --> 01:01:58.700]   is that we have drifted away from a thankful heart for what God has done.
[01:01:58.700 --> 01:02:02.700]   And so we tend to focus on what is not going right,
[01:02:02.700 --> 01:02:05.700]   and we rarely talk about thankfulness of God.
[01:02:05.700 --> 01:02:08.700]   So when you examine your life and your speech,
[01:02:08.700 --> 01:02:13.700]   how often are you genuinely thankful for your salvation and what God has done?
[01:02:13.700 --> 01:02:16.700]   I know we talk about it in Bible study,
[01:02:16.700 --> 01:02:20.700]   we talk about it in a certain given time of fellowship
[01:02:20.700 --> 01:02:22.700]   when you have questions that you have to ask,
[01:02:22.700 --> 01:02:25.700]   but how often when you look at your conversation
[01:02:25.700 --> 01:02:28.700]   are you actually responding to the grace of God?
[01:02:28.700 --> 01:02:32.700]   "Man, I don't deserve this grace. God is so good to me."
[01:02:32.700 --> 01:02:35.700]   How much of your conversation is that, and how much of it is like,
[01:02:35.700 --> 01:02:37.700]   "Yeah, yeah, God is so good. He's so awesome.
[01:02:37.700 --> 01:02:43.700]   But man, what is wrong with this? What is wrong with that?"
[01:02:43.700 --> 01:02:44.700]   That's what he means by "hold fast."
[01:02:44.700 --> 01:02:47.700]   In fact, our whole study of the book of Hebrews,
[01:02:47.700 --> 01:02:50.700]   when it says, "Do not drift,"
[01:02:50.700 --> 01:02:52.700]   he keeps saying over and over again,
[01:02:52.700 --> 01:02:57.700]   "Hold fast, hold fast, hold fast, hold fast, what you profess to believe."
[01:02:57.700 --> 01:02:59.700]   Don't make it just a song that you sing.
[01:02:59.700 --> 01:03:01.700]   Don't make it just a verse that you memorize.
[01:03:01.700 --> 01:03:05.700]   Don't make it just a doctrinal statement that you believe.
[01:03:05.700 --> 01:03:07.700]   He says that's what he means by "hold fast."
[01:03:07.700 --> 01:03:10.700]   May it affect your heart, may it affect your speech,
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.700]   may it affect everything that you do.
[01:03:12.700 --> 01:03:17.700]   That's what he means by "hold fast."
[01:03:17.700 --> 01:03:22.700]   You know, at the core, when we say, "Hold fast to the gospel that was preached,
[01:03:22.700 --> 01:03:26.700]   that we profess," first, why it deals with our grumbling is,
[01:03:26.700 --> 01:03:29.700]   first and foremost, holding on to the gospel,
[01:03:29.700 --> 01:03:31.700]   holding fast to the gospel,
[01:03:31.700 --> 01:03:37.700]   causes us to remember that we have absolute eternal security.
[01:03:37.700 --> 01:03:41.700]   No genuine Christian is constantly living in nervousness.
[01:03:41.700 --> 01:03:43.700]   "Am I going to make it? Am I not going to make it?"
[01:03:43.700 --> 01:03:45.700]   We're talking about, like, eternal heaven,
[01:03:45.700 --> 01:03:48.700]   like, eternal bliss versus eternal damnation, eternal.
[01:03:48.700 --> 01:03:53.700]   Hell and fire versus euphoria, you know, forever.
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:56.700]   Imagine living in between these two things.
[01:03:56.700 --> 01:03:59.700]   Otter poverty and disease for eternity
[01:03:59.700 --> 01:04:03.700]   versus winning the biggest lottery and you're living day to day,
[01:04:03.700 --> 01:04:05.700]   like, "Oh, am I going to get this or am I going to get that?"
[01:04:05.700 --> 01:04:09.700]   He says, "No, the gospel teaches us that we have absolute security in Christ
[01:04:09.700 --> 01:04:12.700]   because we did not earn it, we cannot lose it."
[01:04:12.700 --> 01:04:16.700]   So holding fast to the gospel that we profess,
[01:04:16.700 --> 01:04:20.700]   it gives us a solid ground that can never be shaken.
[01:04:20.700 --> 01:04:24.700]   And so we celebrate what he has done.
[01:04:24.700 --> 01:04:26.700]   We celebrate the eternal security that we have in Christ.
[01:04:26.700 --> 01:04:31.700]   So holding on to the gospel message that we profess
[01:04:31.700 --> 01:04:34.700]   gives us the foundation that we need to build this house.
[01:04:34.700 --> 01:04:37.700]   Secondly, it assures us of his sovereignty,
[01:04:37.700 --> 01:04:40.700]   that no matter what happens, he works all things together
[01:04:40.700 --> 01:04:43.700]   for those who have been called according to his purpose.
[01:04:43.700 --> 01:04:47.700]   So he orchestrated everything to get us here,
[01:04:47.700 --> 01:04:50.700]   and he's also orchestrating everything to make us make sure
[01:04:50.700 --> 01:04:53.700]   that he who began a good work in us will carry it on to completion
[01:04:53.700 --> 01:04:55.700]   in his sovereign hands.
[01:04:55.700 --> 01:04:57.700]   That no matter what may be happening in your life,
[01:04:57.700 --> 01:05:00.700]   no matter what may have happened, no matter how tragic,
[01:05:00.700 --> 01:05:05.700]   no matter how confusing it is, why he is doing what he is doing,
[01:05:05.700 --> 01:05:07.700]   he says, "You are in his sovereign hands."
[01:05:07.700 --> 01:05:10.700]   He who did not spare his own son,
[01:05:10.700 --> 01:05:14.700]   how will he not along with him give all things?
[01:05:14.700 --> 01:05:17.700]   If he loved you enough, if this sovereign God loved you enough
[01:05:17.700 --> 01:05:22.700]   to give his only begotten son, why would he spare what you need?
[01:05:22.700 --> 01:05:25.700]   Why wouldn't he protect you from what harms you?
[01:05:25.700 --> 01:05:28.700]   Why would he allow these things to happen
[01:05:28.700 --> 01:05:31.700]   if he gave the most and most precious thing?
[01:05:31.700 --> 01:05:34.700]   So we believe in his sovereignty,
[01:05:34.700 --> 01:05:38.700]   that despite whatever may be happening in our life,
[01:05:38.700 --> 01:05:41.700]   God is completely sovereign, and we trust him.
[01:05:41.700 --> 01:05:44.700]   And third and finally, the word of truth, the gospel,
[01:05:44.700 --> 01:05:48.700]   reminds us of the reward that's coming in Christ,
[01:05:48.700 --> 01:05:54.700]   that ultimately the gift is not what is external.
[01:05:54.700 --> 01:05:59.700]   You know, very thankful for the families who are adopting children.
[01:05:59.700 --> 01:06:02.700]   Obviously, before they're adopted, they're in foster care,
[01:06:02.700 --> 01:06:04.700]   and you have people who are temporarily taking care of them,
[01:06:04.700 --> 01:06:06.700]   and then when they come to the United States,
[01:06:06.700 --> 01:06:08.700]   or wherever they're coming from,
[01:06:08.700 --> 01:06:11.700]   the home that they go to usually is better.
[01:06:11.700 --> 01:06:13.700]   You have a nice home, you have loving parents,
[01:06:13.700 --> 01:06:15.700]   you have living in Orange County,
[01:06:15.700 --> 01:06:17.700]   you get to come to church and be loved by community.
[01:06:17.700 --> 01:06:20.700]   I mean, it's so much better.
[01:06:20.700 --> 01:06:22.700]   But when the kids come, when they're young,
[01:06:22.700 --> 01:06:24.700]   they may look at the external circumstance
[01:06:24.700 --> 01:06:28.700]   and the food that they have and say, "Wow, this is great!"
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:31.700]   But at some point in their maturity, they're going to realize
[01:06:31.700 --> 01:06:35.700]   that the real gift that they have is the parents who love them.
[01:06:35.700 --> 01:06:37.700]   And the reason why they have everything they have
[01:06:37.700 --> 01:06:41.700]   is because they were adopted by these loving parents.
[01:06:41.700 --> 01:06:44.700]   And that the scripture says that the gift of the gospel
[01:06:44.700 --> 01:06:46.700]   is not the external things.
[01:06:46.700 --> 01:06:48.700]   Sometimes we may have it, sometimes we may not have it.
[01:06:48.700 --> 01:06:53.700]   But ultimately, the ultimate gift is Christ himself.
[01:06:53.700 --> 01:06:56.700]   And that's why he means, when Paul says in Philippians 3, 8,
[01:06:56.700 --> 01:06:59.700]   "In view of the surpassing knowledge of knowing Jesus Christ,"
[01:06:59.700 --> 01:07:04.700]   everything else became rubbish in comparison.
[01:07:04.700 --> 01:07:08.700]   So when we hold fast to these truths,
[01:07:08.700 --> 01:07:11.700]   and it affects our heart, and it affects our thinking,
[01:07:11.700 --> 01:07:14.700]   and it affects our words,
[01:07:14.700 --> 01:07:18.700]   it tends to drive out murmuring.
[01:07:18.700 --> 01:07:22.700]   And it causes people to worship.
[01:07:22.700 --> 01:07:28.700]   And so that's what he means by constantly holding fast.
[01:07:28.700 --> 01:07:30.700]   And that's why we have the communion table.
[01:07:30.700 --> 01:07:32.700]   And that's why we sing these songs.
[01:07:32.700 --> 01:07:33.700]   That's why we gather together.
[01:07:33.700 --> 01:07:39.700]   If you have a room full of murmuring people, stay away.
[01:07:39.700 --> 01:07:41.700]   People always say, "Oh, we're not united.
[01:07:41.700 --> 01:07:44.700]   We should have more activities to get people united."
[01:07:44.700 --> 01:07:47.700]   If you have a room full of complaining people,
[01:07:47.700 --> 01:07:51.700]   oh my gosh, don't go there. Avoid that.
[01:07:51.700 --> 01:07:53.700]   Just because you get a lot of people together
[01:07:53.700 --> 01:07:56.700]   doesn't mean there's going to be unity.
[01:07:56.700 --> 01:07:58.700]   You got a lot of people who are discontent with murmuring,
[01:07:58.700 --> 01:08:00.700]   complaining, and questioning,
[01:08:00.700 --> 01:08:02.700]   and you think somehow all of a sudden you're going to go there
[01:08:02.700 --> 01:08:04.700]   and things are going to change.
[01:08:04.700 --> 01:08:07.700]   No, they spread like gangrene.
[01:08:07.700 --> 01:08:10.700]   A murmuring, complaining spirit tends to spread.
[01:08:10.700 --> 01:08:13.700]   And that's why the Bible says to deal with divisive people,
[01:08:13.700 --> 01:08:17.700]   because it has a tendency to spread.
[01:08:17.700 --> 01:08:21.700]   But if you have a room full of people worshiping God,
[01:08:21.700 --> 01:08:23.700]   thankful in their heart--
[01:08:23.700 --> 01:08:24.700]   have you ever had a fellowship,
[01:08:24.700 --> 01:08:26.700]   whether it's four people or five people,
[01:08:26.700 --> 01:08:30.700]   they're just happy to be there.
[01:08:30.700 --> 01:08:31.700]   And you may have had a bad day,
[01:08:31.700 --> 01:08:34.700]   all of a sudden you show up and you just forget.
[01:08:34.700 --> 01:08:37.700]   And you're like, "Oh, wow, that's right. Things are good."
[01:08:37.700 --> 01:08:40.700]   And a fellowship of the church is meant to be a gathering
[01:08:40.700 --> 01:08:42.700]   of people who've been affected by the truth,
[01:08:42.700 --> 01:08:44.700]   who have come to worship God.
[01:08:44.700 --> 01:08:47.700]   So it's kind of like coming to a chiropractor.
[01:08:47.700 --> 01:08:49.700]   Any of you who've had a bad back or something,
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:53.700]   you go to a chiropractor and they go, "Click, click, click."
[01:08:53.700 --> 01:08:57.700]   And you say, "Oh, my gosh, that feels so good."
[01:08:57.700 --> 01:08:59.700]   And then you're able to walk, the pain goes away,
[01:08:59.700 --> 01:09:00.700]   and that just felt so good.
[01:09:00.700 --> 01:09:04.700]   See, the gathering of the believers in the corporate body
[01:09:04.700 --> 01:09:07.700]   is kind of like a chiropractor,
[01:09:07.700 --> 01:09:09.700]   because our natural tendency as we walk on this earth
[01:09:09.700 --> 01:09:11.700]   is like, "Oh, my gosh, that guy flipped me off again.
[01:09:11.700 --> 01:09:14.700]   Salad for lunch, come on.
[01:09:14.700 --> 01:09:17.700]   Come on, Amazon, pick up the phone."
[01:09:17.700 --> 01:09:19.700]   And then we gather together to worship.
[01:09:20.700 --> 01:09:22.700]   That's right.
[01:09:22.700 --> 01:09:25.700]   My eternity is secure.
[01:09:25.700 --> 01:09:28.700]   I don't understand what's going on, but he is sovereign.
[01:09:28.700 --> 01:09:31.700]   Oh, my gosh, thank you, Jesus.
[01:09:31.700 --> 01:09:34.700]   That's what the corporate gathering was meant to be.
[01:09:34.700 --> 01:09:37.700]   To recalibrate, constantly recalibrate,
[01:09:37.700 --> 01:09:39.700]   and to give thanks to God.
[01:09:39.700 --> 01:09:41.700]   And that's why he says, "Do not murmur."
[01:09:41.700 --> 01:09:44.700]   It is unfitting for Christians.
[01:09:44.700 --> 01:09:46.700]   But fourth and finally, he says,
[01:09:46.700 --> 01:09:48.700]   we need to learn to be thankful.
[01:09:48.700 --> 01:09:50.700]   That's not something that we just turn on and off.
[01:09:50.700 --> 01:09:54.700]   Verse 17, "But even if I am being poured out as a drink offering."
[01:09:54.700 --> 01:09:56.700]   Let me stop right there.
[01:09:56.700 --> 01:09:59.700]   The book of Philippians is oftentimes titled
[01:09:59.700 --> 01:10:02.700]   as the book of rejoicing, book of joy.
[01:10:02.700 --> 01:10:04.700]   Paul is writing this sitting in prison,
[01:10:04.700 --> 01:10:07.700]   chained to a Roman guard.
[01:10:07.700 --> 01:10:09.700]   And it's not a pleasant place to be.
[01:10:09.700 --> 01:10:12.700]   And he's writing to the people who are sitting on the outside,
[01:10:12.700 --> 01:10:15.700]   telling them to rejoice.
[01:10:15.700 --> 01:10:18.700]   When he says, "I am being poured out as a drink offering,"
[01:10:18.700 --> 01:10:22.700]   drink offering in the Old Testament was kind of like a benediction.
[01:10:22.700 --> 01:10:26.700]   You gave all your burnt offerings, or thank offering,
[01:10:26.700 --> 01:10:29.700]   and guilt offering, and at the very end,
[01:10:29.700 --> 01:10:33.700]   they would give a pour out offering, or drink offering.
[01:10:33.700 --> 01:10:35.700]   Drink offering was kind of like a benediction.
[01:10:35.700 --> 01:10:37.700]   It was the very last thing that they did.
[01:10:37.700 --> 01:10:40.700]   So what Paul means by, "I am being poured out as a drink offering,"
[01:10:40.700 --> 01:10:42.700]   he's facing death.
[01:10:42.700 --> 01:10:45.700]   He said, "I'm sitting in prison, and I could possibly die."
[01:10:45.700 --> 01:10:48.700]   But he says, "Even though I'm being poured out as a drink offering,
[01:10:48.700 --> 01:10:52.700]   upon the sacrifice and service of your faith."
[01:10:52.700 --> 01:10:55.700]   He's not dying because he believed Jesus
[01:10:55.700 --> 01:10:57.700]   and he was quietly trying to take care of his family.
[01:10:57.700 --> 01:11:00.700]   He said, "No, he was risking his life to go to these dangerous places
[01:11:00.700 --> 01:11:03.700]   and preach the gospel."
[01:11:03.700 --> 01:11:05.700]   He's being stoned, he's being beaten.
[01:11:05.700 --> 01:11:08.700]   And in the end, he actually gets beheaded and he dies.
[01:11:08.700 --> 01:11:10.700]   So he recognizes this, and he says,
[01:11:10.700 --> 01:11:12.700]   "Even though I'm being poured out as a drink offering,
[01:11:12.700 --> 01:11:16.700]   for the sake of your faith, I rejoice
[01:11:16.700 --> 01:11:18.700]   and share my joy with you all.
[01:11:18.700 --> 01:11:21.700]   You too, I urge you, rejoice in the same way
[01:11:21.700 --> 01:11:25.700]   and share your joy with me."
[01:11:25.700 --> 01:11:28.700]   I have to be honest.
[01:11:28.700 --> 01:11:32.700]   I mean, I don't know how many times in the years that I've been in ministry,
[01:11:32.700 --> 01:11:35.700]   I've thought to myself inwardly,
[01:11:35.700 --> 01:11:39.700]   "These people don't deserve me."
[01:11:39.700 --> 01:11:43.700]   You can judge me, because I judge myself.
[01:11:43.700 --> 01:11:47.700]   "They don't deserve me, you selfish people.
[01:11:47.700 --> 01:11:49.700]   I don't want to keep doing this.
[01:11:49.700 --> 01:11:53.700]   Why does God save sinners anyway?"
[01:11:53.700 --> 01:11:59.700]   Esther knows, because I usually grumble to her.
[01:11:59.700 --> 01:12:03.700]   The greatest mystery that I have found,
[01:12:03.700 --> 01:12:07.700]   the longer I live, I understand hell.
[01:12:07.700 --> 01:12:10.700]   I really understand hell.
[01:12:10.700 --> 01:12:13.700]   Because we don't deserve it.
[01:12:13.700 --> 01:12:16.700]   I understand why an angry God who is almighty and powerful, who is holy,
[01:12:16.700 --> 01:12:18.700]   would wipe us out and punish us for our sins.
[01:12:18.700 --> 01:12:20.700]   I understand that.
[01:12:20.700 --> 01:12:24.700]   I don't understand why a holy God who doesn't need us
[01:12:24.700 --> 01:12:26.700]   goes through what he goes through
[01:12:26.700 --> 01:12:29.700]   with the constant grumbling and complaining that we do
[01:12:29.700 --> 01:12:33.700]   and is continuing to be patient with us.
[01:12:33.700 --> 01:12:37.700]   I don't understand. I don't get it.
[01:12:37.700 --> 01:12:43.700]   I'm so frustrated with Amazon right now.
[01:12:43.700 --> 01:12:48.700]   I don't know how God is patient with the world for this long.
[01:12:48.700 --> 01:12:51.700]   I don't get it.
[01:12:51.700 --> 01:12:54.700]   I'm being poured out as a drinker. I'm going to die for your faith.
[01:12:54.700 --> 01:12:57.700]   But he says, "I rejoice."
[01:12:57.700 --> 01:12:59.700]   How did you do that?
[01:12:59.700 --> 01:13:02.700]   How did that just happen?
[01:13:02.700 --> 01:13:05.700]   In 1 Thessalonians 5.18, he says, "In everything, give thanks,
[01:13:05.700 --> 01:13:07.700]   for this is God's will for you."
[01:13:07.700 --> 01:13:09.700]   Everything?
[01:13:09.700 --> 01:13:12.700]   Hey, Pastor Peter, you don't know my situation.
[01:13:12.700 --> 01:13:14.700]   You don't know what I've been through.
[01:13:14.700 --> 01:13:16.700]   You don't know the kind of stuff that I've seen.
[01:13:16.700 --> 01:13:19.700]   And you're absolutely right. I don't know.
[01:13:19.700 --> 01:13:22.700]   But the one who wrote this does know.
[01:13:22.700 --> 01:13:25.700]   The one who says this knows who you are.
[01:13:25.700 --> 01:13:28.700]   In fact, probably better than you.
[01:13:28.700 --> 01:13:31.700]   So when he says, "Give thanks for everything,"
[01:13:31.700 --> 01:13:33.700]   he means everything.
[01:13:33.700 --> 01:13:35.700]   Not just for the things that you understand.
[01:13:35.700 --> 01:13:37.700]   Not just for the things that make sense.
[01:13:37.700 --> 01:13:40.700]   Not just for the things that's going to lead to something better.
[01:13:40.700 --> 01:13:43.700]   But he says, "Everything."
[01:13:43.700 --> 01:13:46.700]   Because our salvation is secure, our God is sovereign.
[01:13:46.700 --> 01:13:49.700]   And because Jesus is good.
[01:13:49.700 --> 01:13:52.700]   He says to give thanks.
[01:13:52.700 --> 01:13:56.700]   Philippians 4.11-13, he says, "Not that I speak from want,
[01:13:56.700 --> 01:14:02.700]   for I have learned to be content in whatever circumstances I am in."
[01:14:02.700 --> 01:14:05.700]   He said, "I learned it."
[01:14:05.700 --> 01:14:09.700]   This is a guy who was handpicked by Jesus.
[01:14:09.700 --> 01:14:11.700]   Supernaturally converted.
[01:14:11.700 --> 01:14:14.700]   Holy Spirit is speaking to him, explaining the gospel to him.
[01:14:14.700 --> 01:14:18.700]   And he's explaining to the rest of the world, writing the New Testament,
[01:14:18.700 --> 01:14:21.700]   about the grace of God, the mercy of God, the love of God.
[01:14:21.700 --> 01:14:24.700]   I mean, this is a guy who was stoned in Lystra,
[01:14:24.700 --> 01:14:27.700]   dragged out of the city, shook off the dust,
[01:14:27.700 --> 01:14:31.700]   went back, and kept preaching.
[01:14:31.700 --> 01:14:33.700]   I mean, this is not a normal human being.
[01:14:33.700 --> 01:14:35.700]   At least, I don't, you know, we hear stories about it.
[01:14:35.700 --> 01:14:39.700]   But this guy literally was stoned and walked back in.
[01:14:39.700 --> 01:14:42.700]   He was ready to die.
[01:14:42.700 --> 01:14:46.700]   And he actually died.
[01:14:46.700 --> 01:14:50.700]   And yet he says, "I learned to be content."
[01:14:50.700 --> 01:14:52.700]   "I learned to be content."
[01:14:52.700 --> 01:14:55.700]   Because that's what sanctification is.
[01:14:55.700 --> 01:15:01.700]   We hear the gospel of Jesus Christ, and we convert it.
[01:15:01.700 --> 01:15:05.700]   We saw the glory of what that is, and we believe, and we convert it.
[01:15:05.700 --> 01:15:08.700]   And then for whatever the reason, we want to be more sophisticated,
[01:15:08.700 --> 01:15:11.700]   and then we want to learn systematic theology,
[01:15:11.700 --> 01:15:12.700]   we want to learn all this stuff.
[01:15:12.700 --> 01:15:14.700]   He's like, "Oh, those were young Christians.
[01:15:14.700 --> 01:15:17.700]   You haven't been a Christian as long as I have.
[01:15:17.700 --> 01:15:20.700]   You haven't read as much, you haven't experienced as much as I have."
[01:15:20.700 --> 01:15:26.700]   But the most mature Christian is the one who is the most deeply affected by the cross.
[01:15:26.700 --> 01:15:29.700]   Not the one who has a PhD in scholarship.
[01:15:29.700 --> 01:15:32.700]   So I'm not saying that none of that is necessary.
[01:15:32.700 --> 01:15:35.700]   The more we learn about Christ, the more we should be affected.
[01:15:35.700 --> 01:15:39.700]   But learning itself doesn't make you mature.
[01:15:39.700 --> 01:15:42.700]   Experience itself doesn't make you mature.
[01:15:42.700 --> 01:15:46.700]   You can have a PhD, and you can bear a lot of fruit,
[01:15:46.700 --> 01:15:49.700]   constantly murmuring in your heart,
[01:15:49.700 --> 01:15:51.700]   and we're not really giving worship.
[01:15:51.700 --> 01:15:54.700]   We're opening up our mouth, we're singing the songs, we're attending Bible study,
[01:15:54.700 --> 01:15:56.700]   but we're not giving worship.
[01:15:56.700 --> 01:15:59.700]   Because worship is something that happens when we're genuinely thankful,
[01:15:59.700 --> 01:16:02.700]   and it's rising up from us.
[01:16:02.700 --> 01:16:07.700]   And it's encouraging to me to hear that Apostle Paul had to learn this.
[01:16:07.700 --> 01:16:10.700]   He learned the secret of being content in every and all situation,
[01:16:10.700 --> 01:16:16.700]   where Christ became more valuable to him as time passed than the beginning.
[01:16:16.700 --> 01:16:18.700]   And that's a challenge that you and I have.
[01:16:19.700 --> 01:16:24.700]   Where we have a tendency to have him be so precious in the beginning,
[01:16:24.700 --> 01:16:28.700]   and then not so much as we go along.
[01:16:28.700 --> 01:16:31.700]   He learned. So we also need to learn to be content.
[01:16:31.700 --> 01:16:35.700]   Not just once a year, but every day.
[01:16:35.700 --> 01:16:38.700]   To learn to be true worshipers in spirit and in truth.
[01:16:38.700 --> 01:16:43.700]   So let me finish with this one story that's always a reminder to me as encouragement.
[01:16:43.700 --> 01:16:46.700]   You know, yesterday we had Ryan and Mel's wedding.
[01:16:46.700 --> 01:16:49.700]   I know that Cindy and Alex also got married in the Valley.
[01:16:49.700 --> 01:16:53.700]   Ryan and Mel, I was intimately involved with that.
[01:16:53.700 --> 01:16:56.700]   And so they were going back and forth, and some of you guys who know the story,
[01:16:56.700 --> 01:17:01.700]   because of the COVID situation, was not able to have their wedding where they originally planned.
[01:17:01.700 --> 01:17:06.700]   And so up until even Saturday morning, like 3 a.m., they were scrambling,
[01:17:06.700 --> 01:17:07.700]   "What are we going to do? What are we going to do?"
[01:17:07.700 --> 01:17:11.700]   I said, "Well, at least maybe just have it at church, you know, and outside."
[01:17:11.700 --> 01:17:15.700]   And so very last minute, they were putting things together,
[01:17:15.700 --> 01:17:20.700]   and so we just kind of did that, and outside for people, the guests to come and to visit.
[01:17:20.700 --> 01:17:24.700]   And so a lot of us were able to come and see them and participate in all of that.
[01:17:24.700 --> 01:17:28.700]   And obviously, you know, I've known Mel since she was a freshman in college.
[01:17:28.700 --> 01:17:30.700]   I've known Ryan since he was a kid.
[01:17:30.700 --> 01:17:34.700]   So, you know, like we're kind of burdened, because I wanted them to have a good wedding.
[01:17:34.700 --> 01:17:37.700]   I don't want the wedding to be something that they're going to look back years later and say,
[01:17:37.700 --> 01:17:40.700]   "Oh my gosh, this COVID ruined our wedding."
[01:17:40.700 --> 01:17:44.700]   So I feel for, you know, many of our members in our church who are going through that,
[01:17:44.700 --> 01:17:47.700]   you know, being concerned.
[01:17:47.700 --> 01:17:51.700]   But those of you guys who participated, I mean, it went well.
[01:17:51.700 --> 01:17:56.700]   And I'm not going into the details of--and I really feel, and I think they would agree,
[01:17:56.700 --> 01:18:01.700]   that it was an answered prayer, because what we really wanted from the wedding
[01:18:01.700 --> 01:18:03.700]   actually benefited from what happened.
[01:18:03.700 --> 01:18:05.700]   Again, I'm not going to go into the details of that.
[01:18:05.700 --> 01:18:09.700]   And I'm just very thankful for what happened.
[01:18:09.700 --> 01:18:12.700]   But, you know, one of the weddings that I always remember,
[01:18:12.700 --> 01:18:16.700]   years ago there was a couple in our church who was getting married.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:18.700]   And it was a disaster from the beginning.
[01:18:18.700 --> 01:18:22.700]   You know, we're doing counseling, you have two parents who were going back and forth
[01:18:22.700 --> 01:18:25.700]   of what they wanted, what venue they wanted.
[01:18:25.700 --> 01:18:28.700]   And they didn't really seem to care, but it was the two parents, you know,
[01:18:28.700 --> 01:18:31.700]   like they have a lot of opinions going back and forth.
[01:18:31.700 --> 01:18:33.700]   And they were deciding to do it at this one venue.
[01:18:33.700 --> 01:18:36.700]   And at the very last minute, they said, "Oh, they didn't like it."
[01:18:36.700 --> 01:18:38.700]   And so they had to change.
[01:18:38.700 --> 01:18:40.700]   So it's like, "Okay, okay, we'll just do whatever you want."
[01:18:40.700 --> 01:18:43.700]   And so the dad of the groom said, "You're going to have it at our church,
[01:18:43.700 --> 01:18:45.700]   but they don't have a nice facility.
[01:18:45.700 --> 01:18:48.700]   Their outside courtyard is uglier than ours."
[01:18:48.700 --> 01:18:49.700]   You know what I mean?
[01:18:49.700 --> 01:18:51.700]   And so that's where they're going to have the reception.
[01:18:51.700 --> 01:18:53.700]   We're going to have--okay, let's just do it.
[01:18:53.700 --> 01:18:55.700]   And so they changed it in the last minute.
[01:18:55.700 --> 01:18:59.700]   And then the senior pastor of the church just decided on his own
[01:18:59.700 --> 01:19:01.700]   to invite the whole church.
[01:19:01.700 --> 01:19:04.700]   So he invited about 250 people, and it must have been like 400 or 500 people
[01:19:04.700 --> 01:19:05.700]   who showed up.
[01:19:05.700 --> 01:19:07.700]   So some of you guys know what I'm talking about.
[01:19:07.700 --> 01:19:10.700]   And so by the time we finished and went out,
[01:19:10.700 --> 01:19:12.700]   the real guest didn't have food to eat afterwards
[01:19:12.700 --> 01:19:16.700]   because after we took the pictures, the church people came out,
[01:19:16.700 --> 01:19:18.700]   and they just happened to have an event that Saturday at church.
[01:19:18.700 --> 01:19:21.700]   So anybody who was there ended up eating all the wedding food.
[01:19:21.700 --> 01:19:25.700]   On top of that, right before they went into the wedding,
[01:19:25.700 --> 01:19:27.700]   the people were supposed to set up a little platform and a cover,
[01:19:27.700 --> 01:19:29.700]   like a canopy.
[01:19:29.700 --> 01:19:32.700]   The people who hired just brought it and just dumped it on the ground
[01:19:32.700 --> 01:19:35.700]   and said, "If you want to set it up, it's going to cost you $500."
[01:19:35.700 --> 01:19:37.700]   So they were blackmailing them.
[01:19:37.700 --> 01:19:39.700]   So they said, "Well, you didn't pay for the setup.
[01:19:39.700 --> 01:19:41.700]   You just paid for the rental."
[01:19:41.700 --> 01:19:45.700]   And so we're about to enter the wedding, you know,
[01:19:45.700 --> 01:19:48.700]   and obviously it's like, "Oh, my gosh," and I was upset for them.
[01:19:48.700 --> 01:19:50.700]   And so what are we going to do?
[01:19:50.700 --> 01:19:53.700]   So he basically got blackmailed, paid him $500 to set it up.
[01:19:53.700 --> 01:19:55.700]   And then right before the wedding started,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:58.700]   one of the moms came up to me and said, "You've got to speak in Korean."
[01:19:58.700 --> 01:20:00.700]   [laughter]
[01:20:00.700 --> 01:20:04.700]   And so I said, "I can speak Korean, but not to that extent
[01:20:04.700 --> 01:20:06.700]   because I just impromptu give a message in Korean,
[01:20:06.700 --> 01:20:08.700]   so I just do what I can."
[01:20:08.700 --> 01:20:11.700]   So I went and I just kind of fumbled through this and that.
[01:20:11.700 --> 01:20:14.700]   I tried to translate what I was saying back and forth.
[01:20:14.700 --> 01:20:16.700]   And I was saying, "Oh, my gosh, this was horrible,"
[01:20:16.700 --> 01:20:18.700]   from the beginning to the very end.
[01:20:18.700 --> 01:20:22.700]   Years later, I was talking to the groom, you know, years later,
[01:20:22.700 --> 01:20:26.700]   and I said, "Hey, what's the happiest day that you remember?"
[01:20:26.700 --> 01:20:29.700]   And he said, "Oh, my wedding day."
[01:20:29.700 --> 01:20:33.700]   I'm like, "Your wedding day? Did you forget?"
[01:20:33.700 --> 01:20:35.700]   You know, I wanted to sit down.
[01:20:35.700 --> 01:20:37.700]   "Did you forget what happened at your wedding?"
[01:20:37.700 --> 01:20:40.700]   And he said, "Oh, yeah, yeah, it was difficult."
[01:20:40.700 --> 01:20:43.700]   I said, "So why do you say that was your happiest day?"
[01:20:43.700 --> 01:20:47.700]   He says, "Because I got to marry my best friend."
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:51.700]   And he said, "Man, I was so happy that day.
[01:20:51.700 --> 01:20:54.700]   I was murmuring for him.
[01:20:54.700 --> 01:20:58.700]   I was upset for him. How dare they?"
[01:20:58.700 --> 01:21:02.700]   But he said it was the happiest day of his life.
[01:21:02.700 --> 01:21:05.700]   We get so caught up in the external things,
[01:21:05.700 --> 01:21:09.700]   about the reception, the food, the flowers, and all the stuff.
[01:21:09.700 --> 01:21:11.700]   And sometimes the way that we have weddings,
[01:21:11.700 --> 01:21:13.700]   like that becomes the primary thing,
[01:21:13.700 --> 01:21:18.700]   and the actual marriage becomes a side issue.
[01:21:18.700 --> 01:21:21.700]   That's what we do as Christians sometimes.
[01:21:21.700 --> 01:21:23.700]   We forget what it is that we have in Christ.
[01:21:23.700 --> 01:21:26.700]   We get so worried about church, about our children,
[01:21:26.700 --> 01:21:31.700]   about our plans, our goals, and we get so caught up in this thing,
[01:21:31.700 --> 01:21:36.700]   and then it just sucks us dry in our worship.
[01:21:36.700 --> 01:21:39.700]   So we are busy doing things,
[01:21:39.700 --> 01:21:43.700]   and we're neglecting what's at the core of why he saved us,
[01:21:43.700 --> 01:21:47.700]   so that we would worship him in spirit and in truth.
[01:21:47.700 --> 01:21:50.700]   So this constant murmuring and grumbling
[01:21:50.700 --> 01:21:53.700]   is sucking the Christians dry
[01:21:53.700 --> 01:21:56.700]   for what the church was meant to be, to worship.
[01:21:56.700 --> 01:21:59.700]   So I pray that as we face Thanksgiving,
[01:21:59.700 --> 01:22:02.700]   before Christmas, okay?
[01:22:02.700 --> 01:22:06.700]   We'll give plenty of attention to Christmas after Black Friday,
[01:22:06.700 --> 01:22:10.700]   but at least this week, take some time to consider deeply,
[01:22:10.700 --> 01:22:13.700]   not the external things like, "Oh, I thank you for the job,"
[01:22:13.700 --> 01:22:15.700]   and "God answered my prayer for this,"
[01:22:15.700 --> 01:22:18.700]   but about what we all-- every Christian has.
[01:22:18.700 --> 01:22:21.700]   This God of the universe knows me,
[01:22:21.700 --> 01:22:25.700]   and he loves me, and he saves me.
[01:22:25.700 --> 01:22:28.700]   And the worst possible case,
[01:22:28.700 --> 01:22:31.700]   the worst possible case that you and I can think of right now
[01:22:31.700 --> 01:22:34.700]   is that we get COVID and we die.
[01:22:34.700 --> 01:22:36.700]   I mean, we don't want that,
[01:22:36.700 --> 01:22:39.700]   but it's probably the worst-case scenario.
[01:22:39.700 --> 01:22:42.700]   But even in the worst-case scenario for a Christian,
[01:22:42.700 --> 01:22:45.700]   we get to go home early.
[01:22:45.700 --> 01:22:48.700]   Even though there's sadness,
[01:22:48.700 --> 01:22:51.700]   that's the worst-case scenario for a Christian.
[01:22:51.700 --> 01:22:54.700]   So I pray that that reminder would cause us to worship him
[01:22:54.700 --> 01:22:57.700]   in spirit and in truth. Let's pray.
[01:22:58.700 --> 01:23:01.700]   (footsteps)
[01:23:01.700 --> 01:23:04.700]   Gracious Father,
[01:23:04.700 --> 01:23:08.700]   your goodness is beyond what we could possibly imagine.
[01:23:08.700 --> 01:23:11.700]   I pray that a deeper contemplation
[01:23:11.700 --> 01:23:14.700]   of what it is that we have in you
[01:23:14.700 --> 01:23:17.700]   would cause our murmuring
[01:23:17.700 --> 01:23:20.700]   to be radically changed to thanksgiving
[01:23:20.700 --> 01:23:23.700]   and praise of your name.
[01:23:23.700 --> 01:23:26.700]   I pray, Lord God, that in this thanksgiving season,
[01:23:26.700 --> 01:23:29.700]   we would be able to use your grace to marginalize it more and more,
[01:23:29.700 --> 01:23:32.700]   that as your children help us, Lord God,
[01:23:32.700 --> 01:23:35.700]   that we may be a light to this world,
[01:23:35.700 --> 01:23:38.700]   so that the world may look at us and wonder,
[01:23:38.700 --> 01:23:41.700]   "Why are these people so thankful?"
[01:23:41.700 --> 01:23:44.700]   That you would give us a platform
[01:23:44.700 --> 01:23:47.700]   to share that hope that we have in you.
[01:23:47.700 --> 01:23:50.700]   So we pray for your grace, we pray for your blessing.
[01:23:50.700 --> 01:23:53.700]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:23:53.700 --> 01:23:56.700]   Let's sing our closing praise.
[01:23:56.700 --> 01:23:59.700]   (piano music)
[01:24:22.700 --> 01:24:25.700]   Give thanks
[01:24:25.700 --> 01:24:28.700]   with a grateful heart

[01:24:44.700 --> 01:24:47.700]   His Son

[01:25:14.700 --> 01:25:17.700]   And now
[01:25:17.700 --> 01:25:20.700]   let the weak say
[01:25:20.700 --> 01:25:24.700]   I am strong

[01:25:37.700 --> 01:25:41.700]   for us
[01:25:41.700 --> 01:25:44.700]   And now

[01:26:08.700 --> 01:26:11.700]   Give thanks
[01:26:11.700 --> 01:26:14.700]   with a grateful heart
[01:26:14.700 --> 01:26:17.700]   Give thanks
[01:26:17.700 --> 01:26:20.700]   to the Holy One

[01:27:46.700 --> 01:27:54.700]   Now to Him who is able to keep you from stumbling
[01:27:54.700 --> 01:27:57.700]   and to make you stand in the presence of His glory
[01:27:57.700 --> 01:28:00.700]   blameless with great joy
[01:28:00.700 --> 01:28:02.700]   to the only God our Savior
[01:28:02.700 --> 01:28:04.700]   through Jesus Christ our Lord
[01:28:04.700 --> 01:28:08.700]   be glory, majesty, dominion, and authority
[01:28:08.700 --> 01:28:10.700]   before all time and now and forever
[01:28:10.700 --> 01:28:12.700]   Amen
[01:28:12.700 --> 01:28:17.700]   God sent His Son
[01:28:17.700 --> 01:28:22.700]   They called Him Jesus
[01:28:22.700 --> 01:28:27.700]   He came to love
[01:28:27.700 --> 01:28:32.700]   heal and forgive
[01:28:32.700 --> 01:28:37.700]   kneel and die
[01:28:37.700 --> 01:28:42.700]   to buy my pardon
[01:28:42.700 --> 01:28:47.700]   An empty grave is there to be
[01:28:47.700 --> 01:28:51.700]   a Savior in
[01:28:51.700 --> 01:28:56.700]   Because He lives
[01:28:56.700 --> 01:29:01.700]   I can face tomorrow
[01:29:01.700 --> 01:29:06.700]   Because He lives
[01:29:06.700 --> 01:29:11.700]   All fear is gone
[01:29:11.700 --> 01:29:15.700]   Because I know
[01:29:15.700 --> 01:29:20.700]   He holds the future
[01:29:20.700 --> 01:29:25.700]   And life is worth the living
[01:29:25.700 --> 01:29:30.700]   Just because He lives
[01:29:30.700 --> 01:29:32.700]   Amen
[01:29:32.700 --> 01:29:35.700]   Again, if we can have the group on this side to leave that side
[01:29:35.700 --> 01:29:39.700]   and then just give it a minute before we exit to the other way
[01:29:39.700 --> 01:29:45.700]   (footsteps)
[01:29:45.700 --> 01:29:49.700]   (music)
