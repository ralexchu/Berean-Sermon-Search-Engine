[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.360]   Alright, what am I thankful for?
[00:00:09.360 --> 00:00:12.200]   I guess I'll say I'm thankful for this church, for Berean.
[00:00:12.200 --> 00:00:14.480]   I'm thankful for Berean Community Church.
[00:00:14.480 --> 00:00:15.480]   I think just Berean.
[00:00:15.480 --> 00:00:20.120]   I'm thankful for the community of believers that are at Berean.
[00:00:20.120 --> 00:00:22.120]   How it's just really God-centered.
[00:00:22.120 --> 00:00:25.920]   Taught me to love and grow in my faith more.
[00:00:25.920 --> 00:00:30.280]   Really pushed me and challenged me to grow in my faith.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:33.480]   I'm thankful for all the pastors and all their service.
[00:00:33.480 --> 00:00:36.400]   I'm very thankful for Pastor Peter.
[00:00:36.400 --> 00:00:38.800]   Our faithful teacher, Pastor Peter.
[00:00:38.800 --> 00:00:44.040]   Being the father figure for all of us at this church family.
[00:00:44.040 --> 00:00:51.960]   I'm thankful that I have examples like him and examples like Pastor Mark and his dedication
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:58.280]   to the word and not being afraid to say what needs to be said.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.280]   I'm thankful for all the brothers and sisters.
[00:01:00.280 --> 00:01:03.280]   You guys are all great, great people.
[00:01:03.280 --> 00:01:07.920]   I'm just thankful for the community that God's just provided for me over the past few years.
[00:01:07.920 --> 00:01:12.880]   For all of the brothers and sisters who are so dedicated not only to growing in their
[00:01:12.880 --> 00:01:19.960]   own faith but also dedicated to encouraging one another and to really spur each other
[00:01:19.960 --> 00:01:22.480]   on towards faith and good works.
[00:01:22.480 --> 00:01:23.480]   Yeah.
[00:01:23.480 --> 00:01:24.480]   I'm really thankful for everything.
[00:01:24.480 --> 00:01:27.240]   And I'm just thankful for everything.
[00:01:27.240 --> 00:01:29.600]   I'm thankful for Berean Lunches.
[00:01:29.600 --> 00:01:33.640]   This guy, God has blessed us with a son this year.
[00:01:33.640 --> 00:01:35.400]   Thankful for my wonderful wife.
[00:01:35.400 --> 00:01:36.400]   My fiancee Leah.
[00:01:36.400 --> 00:01:37.400]   My roommates.
[00:01:37.400 --> 00:01:41.520]   Family, friends, the people here at Berean.
[00:01:41.520 --> 00:01:43.520]   People that have prayed for me and sharing.
[00:01:43.520 --> 00:01:52.520]   Just the privilege that we have to be able to be in the Lord's army and to be able to
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:59.160]   be herald of the gospel because it is truly a miracle, an amazing thing to see someone
[00:01:59.160 --> 00:02:00.440]   come from death to life.
