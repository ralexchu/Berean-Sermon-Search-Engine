[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.760]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Romans Chapter 8, I'm going to be reading from verse
[00:00:07.760 --> 00:00:10.040]   28 down to 30.
[00:00:10.040 --> 00:00:19.200]   Reading the ESV, Romans Chapter 8, 28 through 30.
[00:00:19.200 --> 00:00:23.240]   And we know that for those who love God, all things work together for good.
[00:00:23.240 --> 00:00:26.080]   For those who are called according to His purpose.
[00:00:26.080 --> 00:00:30.680]   For those whom He foreknew, He also predestined to be conformed to the image of the Son, in
[00:00:30.680 --> 00:00:33.320]   order that He might be the firstborn among many brothers.
[00:00:33.320 --> 00:00:35.440]   And those whom He predestined, He also called.
[00:00:35.440 --> 00:00:37.800]   And those whom He called, He also justified.
[00:00:37.800 --> 00:00:40.360]   And those whom He justified, He also glorified.
[00:00:40.360 --> 00:00:41.360]   Let's pray.
[00:00:41.360 --> 00:00:51.360]   Gracious and loving Father, we pray that Your Word would impact, that it would guide, lead,
[00:00:51.360 --> 00:00:53.680]   feed, strengthen Your church.
[00:00:53.680 --> 00:00:57.960]   We pray that this time may be anointed by Your Spirit, and again, allow us, Lord God,
[00:00:57.960 --> 00:01:01.320]   to see You and to hear from You and nothing else.
[00:01:01.320 --> 00:01:03.680]   So we pray that You would guard this time for the sake of Your name.
[00:01:03.680 --> 00:01:05.360]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:01:05.360 --> 00:01:06.360]   Amen.
[00:01:06.360 --> 00:01:10.280]   All right, as you guys know, we've been studying through the book of Romans, and Paul has been
[00:01:10.280 --> 00:01:16.080]   just expounding and going into the details of the doctrine of justification.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:21.240]   Justification is basically, simply put, where God, when we talk about the essence of the
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:25.400]   gospel, where Christ was crucified, He who knew no sin became sin so that we might become
[00:01:25.400 --> 00:01:27.360]   the righteousness of God.
[00:01:27.360 --> 00:01:32.000]   He's been expounding that basically the whole book of Romans up to this point.
[00:01:32.000 --> 00:01:33.840]   He's going to continue to do that.
[00:01:33.840 --> 00:01:40.320]   But in justification, in chapter 6 and 7 and part of chapter 8, he's been talking about
[00:01:40.320 --> 00:01:41.320]   sanctification.
[00:01:41.320 --> 00:01:47.480]   All right, so if you've been genuinely justified by grace, by faith alone, it doesn't lead
[00:01:47.480 --> 00:01:50.280]   to licentious life, because that was the big question.
[00:01:50.280 --> 00:01:54.680]   If you say that works, it doesn't add to our salvation, isn't that going to lead a bunch
[00:01:54.680 --> 00:01:57.200]   of people saying, "Well, then we can do whatever we want."
[00:01:57.200 --> 00:02:01.380]   And Paul says, "No, that's not it at all, by no means."
[00:02:01.380 --> 00:02:05.800]   To be justified and to be saved means that you have been united with Christ in His death
[00:02:05.800 --> 00:02:07.840]   and His resurrection.
[00:02:07.840 --> 00:02:11.880]   Not only that, the Holy Spirit is indwelling in you, so the Holy Spirit will constantly
[00:02:11.880 --> 00:02:15.160]   be groaning and interceding on our behalf.
[00:02:15.160 --> 00:02:21.240]   So it is a contradiction for a Christian to feel safe and feel comfortable continuing
[00:02:21.240 --> 00:02:25.240]   to live in this world, because the Holy Spirit is constantly with us.
[00:02:25.240 --> 00:02:30.600]   So he's talking about justification, and then he's been expounding in chapter 6 and 7 about
[00:02:30.600 --> 00:02:32.600]   sanctification.
[00:02:32.600 --> 00:02:36.520]   The text that we're looking at, and then on to probably chapter 9, maybe even all the
[00:02:36.520 --> 00:02:42.600]   way to chapter 11, he's going to give us a little bit more detail about glorification.
[00:02:42.600 --> 00:02:48.840]   Why we are absolutely certain that those who are justified will be sanctified, and those
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:56.800]   who are justified and sanctified, that we have absolute assurance that we will be glorified.
[00:02:56.800 --> 00:03:03.200]   You know, the longer you live, if there's any one thing that absolutely becomes certain,
[00:03:03.200 --> 00:03:05.760]   is that nothing is certain.
[00:03:05.760 --> 00:03:06.760]   Nothing is certain.
[00:03:07.080 --> 00:03:12.040]   You know, whether it is your health, your job, you know, when you're younger, you know,
[00:03:12.040 --> 00:03:15.640]   any little change that happens in your life is like a big deal, but after a while, you
[00:03:15.640 --> 00:03:19.960]   just kind of get accustomed to whatever may come and go.
[00:03:19.960 --> 00:03:26.480]   That's true in jobs, that's true in health, economy, politics, even relationships.
[00:03:26.480 --> 00:03:30.320]   There's nothing that is absolutely certain.
[00:03:30.320 --> 00:03:35.920]   And Paul has been telling us that, reminding us that, that even in our salvation, there
[00:03:35.920 --> 00:03:39.040]   are things that we don't know.
[00:03:39.040 --> 00:03:40.600]   We don't know how to reach out to God.
[00:03:40.600 --> 00:03:43.800]   We don't even know what to pray for at times.
[00:03:43.800 --> 00:03:46.120]   We don't know how to make sense of the world.
[00:03:46.120 --> 00:03:49.280]   We don't know how to make sense of a lot of things that happen in our life.
[00:03:49.280 --> 00:03:52.880]   And so the scripture tells us that that's the reason why the Holy Spirit has been given
[00:03:52.880 --> 00:03:58.640]   to us as a seal, guaranteeing our salvation, because God knows that we don't know.
[00:03:58.640 --> 00:04:04.200]   So even when we don't know, he says, the Holy Spirit knows, and he's groaning on our behalf.
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:08.880]   He knows the mind of the Lord, and he's groaning on our behalf, interceding on our behalf,
[00:04:08.880 --> 00:04:14.200]   and that's what guarantees our sanctification and ultimately our salvation.
[00:04:14.200 --> 00:04:17.680]   But the text that we started looking at in verse 28, we don't know.
[00:04:17.680 --> 00:04:21.160]   There's a lot of things that we don't know, but here's one thing that we absolutely do
[00:04:21.160 --> 00:04:28.440]   know, that we know, in verse 28, that for those who are loved by God, all things work
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:30.780]   together for good.
[00:04:30.780 --> 00:04:36.000]   In other words, he says, we may not know how it works, we may not know how it fits together,
[00:04:36.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   we may not even know at times what to pray for, what is your will, but one thing that
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:44.800]   we do know is that our salvation is absolutely secure.
[00:04:44.800 --> 00:04:48.840]   That no matter what happens in our walk with God, no matter what happens in our life, he
[00:04:48.840 --> 00:04:51.800]   says, we know that our God is sovereign.
[00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:52.800]   Absolutely.
[00:04:52.800 --> 00:04:53.800]   Right?
[00:04:53.800 --> 00:05:00.080]   And the confidence that we have in that is that the scripture clearly tells us that God
[00:05:00.080 --> 00:05:04.800]   is the altar of salvation from past, present, and future.
[00:05:04.800 --> 00:05:08.880]   I don't know if you've ever had a conversation with someone in sharing the gospel, and one
[00:05:08.880 --> 00:05:14.120]   of the common objections that they have about the word of God is that, well, how can you
[00:05:14.120 --> 00:05:15.120]   trust that?
[00:05:15.120 --> 00:05:16.120]   That was written by man.
[00:05:16.120 --> 00:05:20.580]   You know, these are fishermen, tax collectors.
[00:05:20.580 --> 00:05:23.560]   They wrote it, and then the church decided one day to say, hey, you know what, we're
[00:05:23.560 --> 00:05:29.220]   going to accept these as God's word, so it's filled with errors.
[00:05:29.220 --> 00:05:36.140]   You and I know that this partially true, yes, God used men.
[00:05:36.140 --> 00:05:37.880]   So we say Paul wrote Romans.
[00:05:37.880 --> 00:05:40.840]   We say Peter wrote Peter, and Matthew wrote Matthew.
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:45.160]   So we say there are specific human authors, but the reason why we have confidence in the
[00:05:45.160 --> 00:05:49.000]   word of God, because it was the Holy Spirit behind it.
[00:05:49.000 --> 00:05:54.280]   First Peter 1, second Peter 1, 21, it says, for no prophecy was ever produced by the will
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:55.280]   of man.
[00:05:55.280 --> 00:05:56.280]   Right?
[00:05:56.280 --> 00:06:03.660]   So even though Paul wrote it in his words, in his personality, specific concerns that
[00:06:03.660 --> 00:06:05.860]   he had, he said, no prophecy.
[00:06:05.860 --> 00:06:09.500]   Nothing that we have in the Bible was simply by the will of man, but men spoke from God
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:13.540]   as they were carried along by the Holy Spirit.
[00:06:13.540 --> 00:06:16.940]   So the confidence that we have in God's word is not on Peter.
[00:06:16.940 --> 00:06:21.420]   It's not that the church somehow preserved the word of God, and so we have the perfect
[00:06:21.420 --> 00:06:22.420]   word of God.
[00:06:22.420 --> 00:06:27.280]   It's the confidence that we have that even though men were involved, it says it was the
[00:06:27.280 --> 00:06:29.120]   Holy Spirit carrying them along.
[00:06:29.120 --> 00:06:31.800]   That's why we have confidence in the word.
[00:06:31.800 --> 00:06:33.680]   And it is no different with our salvation.
[00:06:33.680 --> 00:06:38.840]   The confidence that we have in our salvation is not because we made a decision, that we
[00:06:38.840 --> 00:06:42.480]   heard and said, that made a lot of sense to me, so I chose to do this.
[00:06:42.480 --> 00:06:47.560]   The scripture tells us, even though you and I may have responded to the calling, that
[00:06:47.560 --> 00:06:53.200]   this salvation happened long before you and I ever heard the gospel, that you and I were
[00:06:53.200 --> 00:06:57.160]   ever even aware of who he was.
[00:06:57.160 --> 00:07:04.320]   Paul talks about, in verse 29 and 30, five separate things, five separate things that
[00:07:04.320 --> 00:07:06.120]   encapsulates justification.
[00:07:06.120 --> 00:07:11.060]   So justification is a part of these five things, but before we even understand justification,
[00:07:11.060 --> 00:07:14.440]   we have to understand where justification started.
[00:07:14.440 --> 00:07:18.480]   It didn't start when we heard the gospel.
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:22.720]   He says first, the first thing that he says in verse 39, "For those whom he foreknew,
[00:07:22.720 --> 00:07:25.940]   he also predestined to be conformed to the image of his Son."
[00:07:25.940 --> 00:07:29.240]   Those he foreknew, the doctrine of foreknowledge.
[00:07:29.240 --> 00:07:35.440]   The doctrine of foreknowledge isn't simply that God looking down history and saw, he
[00:07:35.440 --> 00:07:39.640]   knew that what you were going to do, so he determined based upon what you were going
[00:07:39.640 --> 00:07:42.720]   to do, that he was going to save us.
[00:07:42.720 --> 00:07:44.240]   That is not the doctrine of foreknowledge.
[00:07:44.240 --> 00:07:47.720]   That's not the way the word foreknowledge is used in scripture.
[00:07:47.720 --> 00:07:52.080]   And I think the reason why some people try to explain it that way is trying to answer
[00:07:52.080 --> 00:07:55.600]   the question, "Well, how can God be fair?"
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:59.400]   If he doesn't, if it wasn't based upon us, we're almost kind of like trying to get God
[00:07:59.400 --> 00:08:00.400]   off the hook, right?
[00:08:00.400 --> 00:08:04.820]   "Oh, it wasn't him, it was you."
[00:08:04.820 --> 00:08:10.520]   So somehow it seems to justify, well, because it wasn't him and it's you, so God didn't
[00:08:10.520 --> 00:08:14.040]   actually determine, he was just determining based upon what you were going to do.
[00:08:14.040 --> 00:08:18.080]   It's kind of like a fortune teller.
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:21.200]   And that's absolute heresy.
[00:08:21.200 --> 00:08:25.480]   Not too long ago, there was a false doctrine called the openness of God theology that was
[00:08:25.480 --> 00:08:30.140]   kind of spreading across the country.
[00:08:30.140 --> 00:08:34.360]   And basically that openness of God theology is, well, how do we explain evil?
[00:08:34.360 --> 00:08:36.520]   How do we explain people who've never heard the gospel?
[00:08:36.520 --> 00:08:39.520]   How do we explain these bad things that are happening?
[00:08:39.520 --> 00:08:43.640]   Well, maybe it's because God isn't sovereign.
[00:08:43.640 --> 00:08:44.960]   Maybe it wasn't initiated by God.
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:47.360]   Maybe God doesn't have the power to do anything about it.
[00:08:47.360 --> 00:08:52.120]   So the doctrine is, or openness of God is, he's completely open.
[00:08:52.120 --> 00:08:56.300]   He's just kind of waiting to see what we're going to do, and he's just acting upon what
[00:08:56.300 --> 00:08:57.300]   we do.
[00:08:57.300 --> 00:08:59.600]   So if we do this, and God does this.
[00:08:59.600 --> 00:09:04.920]   And that's basically, in essence, what the openness of God theology was, an absolute
[00:09:04.920 --> 00:09:10.280]   heresy, refuted in every conservative seminary.
[00:09:10.280 --> 00:09:13.420]   That is not the doctrine of foreknowledge.
[00:09:13.420 --> 00:09:21.360]   The word foreknowledge in scripture basically means that God knew us before.
[00:09:21.360 --> 00:09:22.560]   We didn't initiate it.
[00:09:22.560 --> 00:09:23.960]   He initiated it.
[00:09:23.960 --> 00:09:30.160]   The idea that you and I somehow initiated our salvation, and we thought one day, we
[00:09:30.160 --> 00:09:31.640]   heard the gospel and said, "You know what?
[00:09:31.640 --> 00:09:32.640]   That makes sense.
[00:09:32.640 --> 00:09:37.840]   And so I'm going to be saved," contradicts everything that we know about how we are described
[00:09:37.840 --> 00:09:40.240]   before we met Christ.
[00:09:40.240 --> 00:09:45.580]   Romans 3, 23, it says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God."
[00:09:45.580 --> 00:09:51.660]   Jeremiah 17, 9, it says, "Our hearts are deceitful, above all things, desperately corrupt."
[00:09:51.660 --> 00:09:56.520]   Even our ability to determine right or wrong has been corrupt.
[00:09:56.520 --> 00:09:59.300]   We couldn't discern what was right and what was wrong.
[00:09:59.300 --> 00:10:01.460]   And he says, "Don't trust your heart."
[00:10:01.460 --> 00:10:05.940]   2 Corinthians 4, 4, "We were blinded by the God of this age."
[00:10:05.940 --> 00:10:09.220]   We're completely blind to see his glory.
[00:10:09.220 --> 00:10:13.540]   Ephesians 2, 1 and 5, "We are dead in our trespasses and sins."
[00:10:13.540 --> 00:10:14.540]   We weren't just blind.
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:15.540]   We weren't just sick.
[00:10:15.540 --> 00:10:16.880]   We weren't just deceived.
[00:10:16.880 --> 00:10:19.200]   We were completely dead.
[00:10:19.200 --> 00:10:23.180]   Not weak, not sick, but dead in our trespasses.
[00:10:23.180 --> 00:10:28.000]   In Ephesians 4, 17, "We became futile in our mind, darkened in understanding, alienated
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:30.620]   from the life of God, and hardened in heart."
[00:10:30.620 --> 00:10:36.820]   So over and over again, the Bible just, it doesn't describe our pre-Christ stage as somebody
[00:10:36.820 --> 00:10:38.820]   who's sick, who's weak, who's just kind of drifted.
[00:10:38.820 --> 00:10:41.380]   He says, "No, we are dead."
[00:10:41.380 --> 00:10:42.380]   Dead in our trespasses.
[00:10:42.380 --> 00:10:43.380]   Completely blind.
[00:10:43.380 --> 00:10:48.660]   We have no ability to be able to discern what is right or wrong.
[00:10:48.660 --> 00:10:52.460]   So to think that we were in that state and all of a sudden, one day, we decided by our
[00:10:52.460 --> 00:10:54.820]   own will that, "You know what?
[00:10:54.820 --> 00:10:55.820]   I'm going to live."
[00:10:55.820 --> 00:10:56.820]   Right?
[00:10:56.820 --> 00:11:02.300]   That's no more, no more, does that make any sense than a blind person one day wakes up
[00:11:02.300 --> 00:11:03.500]   and says, "I'm tired of being blind."
[00:11:03.500 --> 00:11:04.500]   Right?
[00:11:04.500 --> 00:11:06.860]   "I'm going to see today."
[00:11:06.860 --> 00:11:09.060]   Or somebody who's dead just decides, "I'm tired.
[00:11:09.060 --> 00:11:10.060]   I'm going to wake up today."
[00:11:10.060 --> 00:11:16.580]   See, that's how the Bible describes who we were before we met Christ.
[00:11:16.580 --> 00:11:22.580]   So the doctrine of foreknowledge basically means that before, before you were ever even
[00:11:22.580 --> 00:11:28.140]   aware of who he was, before you even ever heard the gospel, he says, "He knew us."
[00:11:28.140 --> 00:11:32.980]   In fact, that's exactly how the Bible uses the word to know.
[00:11:32.980 --> 00:11:35.860]   In the book of Genesis, it says Adam and Eve knew each other.
[00:11:35.860 --> 00:11:36.860]   Right?
[00:11:36.860 --> 00:11:39.500]   We're not in elementary school, so you know what "knew" means.
[00:11:39.500 --> 00:11:40.500]   Right?
[00:11:40.500 --> 00:11:43.500]   It doesn't mean that he found out her address and found out where she lives.
[00:11:43.500 --> 00:11:45.020]   "Oh, and now I know her."
[00:11:45.020 --> 00:11:47.740]   He's talking about sexual relationship.
[00:11:47.740 --> 00:11:50.100]   They had intimate relationship.
[00:11:50.100 --> 00:11:56.040]   When the scripture says, God says of Israel, Amos 3.2, "You only have I known of all the
[00:11:56.040 --> 00:11:58.180]   families of the earth."
[00:11:58.180 --> 00:12:01.900]   Is he saying that, "Well, Canaanites, I've never heard of these people.
[00:12:01.900 --> 00:12:04.540]   I only know Israel."
[00:12:04.540 --> 00:12:09.540]   What does he mean when he says he knew them or he foreknew them?
[00:12:09.540 --> 00:12:11.900]   That he had intimate knowledge of them.
[00:12:11.900 --> 00:12:18.520]   When the scripture says, the psalmist says that, "God knew me in my mother's womb."
[00:12:18.520 --> 00:12:20.140]   What does that mean?
[00:12:20.140 --> 00:12:25.980]   The psalmist means that even before I was born, God had his attention on me.
[00:12:25.980 --> 00:12:28.860]   He chose me before I was even born.
[00:12:28.860 --> 00:12:33.460]   That's what it means, the doctrine of foreknowledge.
[00:12:33.460 --> 00:12:42.500]   You know, the doctrine of foreknowledge basically is telling us, is reminding us that long before
[00:12:42.500 --> 00:12:48.460]   you ever were even aware of God, God was leading you to the path of justification.
[00:12:48.460 --> 00:12:53.100]   He was orchestrating certain things in your life because he knew us.
[00:12:53.100 --> 00:12:57.900]   And that's really another way of saying that he loved us.
[00:12:57.900 --> 00:13:03.660]   He fixated his thoughts, he fixated his plan and his will long before we were ever aware
[00:13:03.660 --> 00:13:04.660]   of him.
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:05.660]   He had foreknowledge.
[00:13:05.660 --> 00:13:10.280]   Based upon his foreknowledge, it says we were predestined.
[00:13:10.280 --> 00:13:14.300]   And that's the reason why we know that we have absolute security in God.
[00:13:14.300 --> 00:13:18.020]   That his love for us was not just random, one day decided.
[00:13:18.020 --> 00:13:19.900]   He said, "Wow, she's cute, he's cute.
[00:13:19.900 --> 00:13:20.900]   They have potential.
[00:13:20.900 --> 00:13:22.780]   I'm going to love him."
[00:13:22.780 --> 00:13:30.020]   The Bible describes it as long before we were even created, we even knew he existed.
[00:13:30.020 --> 00:13:37.460]   He determined, he predestined, he called and justified, and then he glorified.
[00:13:37.460 --> 00:13:41.040]   Years ago, I attended a mission conference and the pastor was talking about this doctrine
[00:13:41.040 --> 00:13:46.180]   of election and he said, "You know, a long time ago we used to call cars that had been
[00:13:46.180 --> 00:13:47.780]   used, used cars."
[00:13:47.780 --> 00:13:51.980]   And then there was a period when they stopped using the word used cars because that sounds
[00:13:51.980 --> 00:13:52.980]   cheap.
[00:13:52.980 --> 00:13:55.940]   And so they started calling it pre-owned cars.
[00:13:55.940 --> 00:13:57.260]   And that sounds a little bit better.
[00:13:57.260 --> 00:13:58.260]   It doesn't sound as cheap.
[00:13:58.260 --> 00:14:00.420]   And they said, "Australia went another step.
[00:14:00.420 --> 00:14:04.260]   Instead of calling it pre-owned, they started calling it pre-loved."
[00:14:04.260 --> 00:14:05.260]   Pre-loved.
[00:14:05.260 --> 00:14:08.700]   In other words, it's a great car.
[00:14:08.700 --> 00:14:10.380]   It's been loved.
[00:14:10.380 --> 00:14:11.820]   Now you're going to love it.
[00:14:11.820 --> 00:14:12.820]   Right?
[00:14:12.820 --> 00:14:20.900]   Well, the doctrine of foreknowledge is basically another way of saying that God pre-loved us.
[00:14:20.900 --> 00:14:24.500]   Before we ever knew him.
[00:14:24.500 --> 00:14:33.060]   You know, when I first met Esther, you know, I started, when I started having, you know,
[00:14:33.060 --> 00:14:36.740]   affections for her, I only told one person.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:38.260]   And I told my Bible study leader.
[00:14:38.260 --> 00:14:40.300]   I didn't tell anybody else but my Bible study leader.
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.380]   And the reason why I told my Bible study leader was because I asked him to keep me accountable.
[00:14:45.380 --> 00:14:48.900]   You know, because we happen to belong to this Bible study where you have to get permission
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:52.300]   from the leaders and they have to tell you yes and no or whatever.
[00:14:52.300 --> 00:14:55.500]   And I was kind of on the verge of leaving, but I wasn't, you know, I didn't want to get
[00:14:55.500 --> 00:14:56.940]   Esther in trouble.
[00:14:56.940 --> 00:15:01.100]   And so I thought, you know, like, okay, we're on the same page.
[00:15:01.100 --> 00:15:02.780]   At least that's what I was thinking.
[00:15:02.780 --> 00:15:03.780]   But we're not at the time.
[00:15:03.780 --> 00:15:04.780]   We're not at that time yet.
[00:15:04.780 --> 00:15:10.500]   So for a year and a half, I didn't, I never said anything to anybody but my small group
[00:15:10.500 --> 00:15:11.500]   leader.
[00:15:11.500 --> 00:15:13.260]   And I asked him to keep me accountable.
[00:15:13.260 --> 00:15:17.100]   If you see me doing like weird things, like jumping in the car because she's there or
[00:15:17.100 --> 00:15:20.500]   we're playing games and I forced myself into her team.
[00:15:20.500 --> 00:15:26.140]   You know, if I do strange things, like keep me, call me out so that you can keep me accountable.
[00:15:26.140 --> 00:15:31.540]   Well, a year and a half passed by and obviously my affections for her was growing.
[00:15:31.540 --> 00:15:33.140]   I was praying, Lord guard my heart.
[00:15:33.140 --> 00:15:38.100]   And then I found out that she was going to go to the East Coast to attend pharmacy school.
[00:15:38.100 --> 00:15:40.180]   So I thought, well, is she going to go to pharmacy school?
[00:15:40.180 --> 00:15:41.180]   This is before Facebook.
[00:15:41.180 --> 00:15:42.180]   This is before internet.
[00:15:42.180 --> 00:15:43.180]   This is before phones.
[00:15:43.180 --> 00:15:49.060]   At least the one that you carry on your pocket.
[00:15:49.060 --> 00:15:50.060]   Okay.
[00:15:50.060 --> 00:15:51.860]   So if she goes, we're lost forever.
[00:15:51.860 --> 00:15:52.860]   Right.
[00:15:52.860 --> 00:15:53.980]   I'm not going to be able to contact him.
[00:15:53.980 --> 00:15:55.780]   So I decided it's time now.
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:57.320]   I got to tell her now.
[00:15:57.320 --> 00:16:02.140]   And then if for four years we can play, you know, you have a long disrelationship.
[00:16:02.140 --> 00:16:03.140]   This works out.
[00:16:03.140 --> 00:16:05.500]   By the time she comes back, I'm going to be in my late twenties.
[00:16:05.500 --> 00:16:09.940]   I would have finished seminary, maybe gone out to missions, come back and decide.
[00:16:09.940 --> 00:16:13.100]   And so I decided to tell her, you know.
[00:16:13.100 --> 00:16:16.700]   And when I decided to tell her the whole time, you know, I was thinking like, I mean, I've
[00:16:16.700 --> 00:16:20.500]   been dropping hints and I thought she was dropping hints to me.
[00:16:20.500 --> 00:16:24.500]   I was like, I get it Esther.
[00:16:24.500 --> 00:16:25.940]   Right.
[00:16:25.940 --> 00:16:28.460]   So we're, we're dropping hints or at least that's what I'm thinking.
[00:16:28.460 --> 00:16:33.660]   So I finally devised this plan after this, this sports day we had.
[00:16:33.660 --> 00:16:34.860]   And I said, Esther, I'll give you a ride.
[00:16:34.860 --> 00:16:36.100]   And she's like, no, don't worry about it.
[00:16:36.100 --> 00:16:39.580]   I said, no, I'll give you a ride.
[00:16:39.580 --> 00:16:40.580]   And she's like, oh, okay.
[00:16:40.580 --> 00:16:45.940]   And so I, I picked her up and it was like 10, 10 PM and she was living in Culver city
[00:16:45.940 --> 00:16:50.340]   and I was in, I think I was in Downey and I went and picked her up and I was driving
[00:16:50.340 --> 00:16:53.780]   and it was just dead silence for the whole car because I was like, I'm going to tell
[00:16:53.780 --> 00:16:56.820]   her, but you know, it was a little bit awkward.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:17:02.500]   So I was driving and then I asked her, so Esther, you know, what do you think about
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   me?
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:09.100]   So I said, you know, you do it first.
[00:17:09.100 --> 00:17:10.100]   Okay.
[00:17:10.100 --> 00:17:14.020]   So, so she says like a brother.
[00:17:14.020 --> 00:17:23.780]   So I was like, that's not what you call it.
[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:24.780]   What kind of brother?
[00:17:24.780 --> 00:17:27.060]   And she's like, well, you know, like a Christian brother.
[00:17:27.060 --> 00:17:31.060]   And I'm like, well, that makes no sense.
[00:17:31.060 --> 00:17:38.340]   So in the context of talking, I realized, oh shoot, we're not on the same page.
[00:17:38.340 --> 00:17:40.900]   And I'm about 10 minutes from dropping her off.
[00:17:40.900 --> 00:17:45.300]   And I'm like, this is going to be awkward if I don't, if I don't say anything, this
[00:17:45.300 --> 00:17:47.220]   is going to be really awkward.
[00:17:47.220 --> 00:17:49.700]   So I just said, okay, you know, I'm just going to have to say it.
[00:17:49.700 --> 00:17:55.500]   And so I just told her, you know, and she, she acted like she got hit by a truck.
[00:17:55.500 --> 00:17:56.500]   Like what?
[00:17:56.500 --> 00:17:57.500]   Like what?
[00:17:57.500 --> 00:18:03.420]   I mean, there's a lot of like backstory that, that, you know, like I won't get into today,
[00:18:03.420 --> 00:18:05.900]   but anyway, she, I told her and I said, can you pray about it?
[00:18:05.900 --> 00:18:07.980]   And then she left.
[00:18:07.980 --> 00:18:12.220]   And then I didn't hear, I didn't hear from her for like two months.
[00:18:12.220 --> 00:18:15.780]   Because remember I told you I was in a Bible study where the leaders, you know, like they
[00:18:15.780 --> 00:18:17.820]   had to kind of get involved.
[00:18:17.820 --> 00:18:21.380]   And my leaders were telling me before this happened, it's like, Hey Peter, you know,
[00:18:21.380 --> 00:18:22.380]   you should date or whatever.
[00:18:22.380 --> 00:18:25.740]   But just, they were kind of like in the middle, you know, and say, Hey, don't talk to that
[00:18:25.740 --> 00:18:27.420]   guy, you know?
[00:18:27.420 --> 00:18:29.460]   And then two months later we finally got together.
[00:18:29.460 --> 00:18:35.740]   And obviously we got married, you know, but after, you know, speed things up.
[00:18:35.740 --> 00:18:39.980]   But after, you know, we finally got together and we were able to talk and I was telling
[00:18:39.980 --> 00:18:40.980]   her about what happened.
[00:18:40.980 --> 00:18:45.420]   I said, you know, for a year and a half, I thought, I thought we were on the same page,
[00:18:45.420 --> 00:18:46.420]   you know?
[00:18:46.420 --> 00:18:49.740]   And then she's like, I had no idea.
[00:18:49.740 --> 00:18:51.740]   And I said, how can you have no idea?
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:55.540]   How can you have, like after a year and a half, I was like dropping hints.
[00:18:55.540 --> 00:18:58.220]   And then she's like, no, I had no idea.
[00:18:58.220 --> 00:19:05.260]   I said, Esther, remember that day at Cerritos College, we went out witnessing and then I,
[00:19:05.260 --> 00:19:13.140]   I gave you, you know, a precious moment, like a heart shaped container.
[00:19:13.140 --> 00:19:16.780]   And then there was Eminem inside.
[00:19:16.780 --> 00:19:20.460]   Remember I gave that to you in the parking lot?
[00:19:20.460 --> 00:19:23.100]   And then she's like, yeah, that was kind of weird.
[00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:28.860]   And I'm like, what?
[00:19:28.860 --> 00:19:36.020]   Like, why would, why would some random guy to give you a heart shaped, you know, I put
[00:19:36.020 --> 00:19:37.300]   so much thought into that.
[00:19:37.300 --> 00:19:42.940]   I was like, precious moment, you know, it's, it's Christian, it's cute, it's heart shaped.
[00:19:42.940 --> 00:19:44.460]   So she's going to know it's for me.
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:46.660]   But then I wanted her to know that I thought about it.
[00:19:46.660 --> 00:19:51.260]   So if I put a little bit of chocolate in there, you know, she knows that I took time to prepare
[00:19:51.260 --> 00:19:52.260]   this.
[00:19:52.260 --> 00:19:53.500]   So, you know, I put so much thought into it.
[00:19:53.500 --> 00:19:56.940]   And then when I gave it to her, she's like, oh, gee, thanks.
[00:19:56.940 --> 00:20:04.180]   You know, so I said, okay, we'll talk later.
[00:20:04.180 --> 00:20:05.180]   Right.
[00:20:05.180 --> 00:20:09.100]   But she said, she said, I had no idea.
[00:20:09.100 --> 00:20:14.020]   And I was thinking about all the little things that, that I thought we were making connection.
[00:20:14.020 --> 00:20:17.020]   Remember I was giving that sermon and then you were looking at me, it's like, I got it.
[00:20:17.020 --> 00:20:19.380]   I got it.
[00:20:19.380 --> 00:20:23.820]   Two years, two years went by, she knew nothing, right?
[00:20:23.820 --> 00:20:24.820]   Nothing.
[00:20:24.820 --> 00:20:29.780]   Now I share all of this because when we talk about the doctrine of foreknowledge, doctrine
[00:20:29.780 --> 00:20:33.660]   of foreknowledge basically is God telling us, I knew you.
[00:20:33.660 --> 00:20:40.540]   When we think about how we got here, you know, we're always thinking about the future.
[00:20:40.540 --> 00:20:43.620]   God is always taking us backwards.
[00:20:43.620 --> 00:20:47.500]   He always telling us, remember, remember how you got here.
[00:20:47.500 --> 00:20:48.900]   I ordained all of this.
[00:20:48.900 --> 00:20:53.380]   The whole reason why you're here is because God orchestrated certain things in your life.
[00:20:53.380 --> 00:20:58.980]   There were hints of God's presence in your life before you were ever even aware.
[00:20:58.980 --> 00:21:02.660]   Until after you become a Christian, you realize, you look back and say, wow, yeah, I remember
[00:21:02.660 --> 00:21:03.660]   that Christian.
[00:21:03.660 --> 00:21:06.780]   You know, when I was in high school and he would always pray for meals.
[00:21:06.780 --> 00:21:10.180]   And I remember that guy, he was always asking me to come to church.
[00:21:10.180 --> 00:21:13.700]   That missionary, when I was a little kid who came and shared, he's like, yeah, you forgot
[00:21:13.700 --> 00:21:16.020]   about all of that.
[00:21:16.020 --> 00:21:21.140]   But there were glimpses of God's presence in your life because he foreknew you and me
[00:21:21.140 --> 00:21:23.540]   way before we were aware of him.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:25.300]   And that's what the doctrine of foreknowledge is.
[00:21:25.300 --> 00:21:29.740]   God simply is saying, I knew you.
[00:21:29.740 --> 00:21:32.100]   I knew you before you ever even thought about me.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:36.580]   That's why your salvation is so secure in my hands.
[00:21:36.580 --> 00:21:42.460]   He says, based upon his foreknowledge, he predetermined, he predestined us.
[00:21:42.460 --> 00:21:45.940]   In Ephesians chapter one, he says, we were elected, predestined.
[00:21:45.940 --> 00:21:50.500]   And over and over again, it says in Ephesians, because of his pleasure, it was his plan.
[00:21:50.500 --> 00:21:52.100]   It was his purpose.
[00:21:52.100 --> 00:21:57.380]   Over and over and over again, he says it was premeditated.
[00:21:57.380 --> 00:22:02.840]   You know, in the legal system, you know, the way they determine the level of guilt that
[00:22:02.840 --> 00:22:08.940]   you have is the level of premeditation that went into whatever it is that you did.
[00:22:08.940 --> 00:22:12.280]   So there's this murder that you commit just kind of at the heat of the moment.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:15.060]   You got angry and you shot somebody or you did something.
[00:22:15.060 --> 00:22:16.420]   But there's premeditated murder.
[00:22:16.420 --> 00:22:18.260]   It's the worst kind of murder.
[00:22:18.260 --> 00:22:21.340]   Because you took time to think it out.
[00:22:21.340 --> 00:22:23.260]   You took time to plan.
[00:22:23.260 --> 00:22:28.420]   You knew the consequences and you actually tried to get rid of the weapon and bury the
[00:22:28.420 --> 00:22:29.420]   body.
[00:22:29.420 --> 00:22:30.420]   You did all of that.
[00:22:30.420 --> 00:22:31.420]   All of that was planned.
[00:22:31.420 --> 00:22:32.420]   That when was it planned?
[00:22:32.420 --> 00:22:33.420]   It says two years ago.
[00:22:33.420 --> 00:22:34.620]   What?
[00:22:34.620 --> 00:22:36.220]   For two years ago, you've been planning this out.
[00:22:36.220 --> 00:22:39.700]   Your heart is that evil?
[00:22:39.700 --> 00:22:46.620]   So culpability is directly linked to premeditation.
[00:22:46.620 --> 00:22:51.060]   So when the scripture tells us that he predestined, you know, we get so caught up as how does
[00:22:51.060 --> 00:22:52.060]   this work?
[00:22:52.060 --> 00:22:53.300]   What about man's free will?
[00:22:53.300 --> 00:22:58.020]   And you missed the whole point of why he says it was predetermined.
[00:22:58.020 --> 00:23:02.220]   Based upon his foreknowledge, he predetermined, he premeditated.
[00:23:02.220 --> 00:23:03.220]   When?
[00:23:03.220 --> 00:23:06.620]   According to Ephesians, before the creation of the world.
[00:23:06.620 --> 00:23:09.740]   Again, I don't know how that works.
[00:23:09.740 --> 00:23:16.540]   But he says that's how deep and that's how far my foreknowledge and predestination goes.
[00:23:16.540 --> 00:23:19.860]   We were predestined according to his love.
[00:23:19.860 --> 00:23:24.980]   And that's why Paul says in Galatians 6, 17, that in the midst of persecution, risking
[00:23:24.980 --> 00:23:33.860]   his life, he says, "Let no one cause me trouble for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus."
[00:23:33.860 --> 00:23:37.460]   You may read that passage and Paul say, "Don't mess with me.
[00:23:37.460 --> 00:23:38.460]   I'll kill you."
[00:23:38.460 --> 00:23:39.460]   Right?
[00:23:39.460 --> 00:23:43.180]   That's not what Paul is saying.
[00:23:43.180 --> 00:23:45.040]   He's already been beaten.
[00:23:45.040 --> 00:23:47.220]   He's already been in prison.
[00:23:47.220 --> 00:23:51.300]   He's been threatened with imprisonment and beheading over and over again.
[00:23:51.300 --> 00:23:54.980]   And he says, they were even prophesied saying if you go to Jerusalem, you're going to be
[00:23:54.980 --> 00:23:56.140]   bound and beaten.
[00:23:56.140 --> 00:23:58.580]   You may not come back.
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:24:01.380]   So when he writes the book of Galatians, he's not saying, "Don't mess with me.
[00:24:01.380 --> 00:24:04.300]   Jesus is on my side."
[00:24:04.300 --> 00:24:07.700]   When he says, "Let no one cause trouble for me for I bear on my body the marks of Jesus
[00:24:07.700 --> 00:24:14.620]   Christ," meaning that his crucifixion, his blood, his pain, I've been tagged by the blood
[00:24:14.620 --> 00:24:17.020]   of Christ.
[00:24:17.020 --> 00:24:24.020]   You can punch me, kick me, put me in prison, behead me, but you can't hurt me because I've
[00:24:24.020 --> 00:24:27.020]   been tagged by the love of God.
[00:24:27.020 --> 00:24:29.180]   And that's what we're going to be getting into in verse 31.
[00:24:29.180 --> 00:24:31.700]   He says, "Then what then shall we say to these things?
[00:24:31.700 --> 00:24:33.780]   If God is for us, who can be against us?"
[00:24:33.780 --> 00:24:37.380]   See, that's the point of predestination.
[00:24:37.380 --> 00:24:42.000]   If God is for us, nothing can separate us from the love of God.
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:44.860]   Not even life, not even death.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:47.180]   See, that's the point of foreknowledge.
[00:24:47.180 --> 00:24:49.660]   That's the point of predestination.
[00:24:49.660 --> 00:24:57.920]   And based upon that, right, based upon that, this is where we finally show up in the calling.
[00:24:57.920 --> 00:25:08.340]   Those who have been foreknown, they were under the scrutiny of my predetermination, premeditation.
[00:25:08.340 --> 00:25:12.460]   Those who are predestined, he says he called.
[00:25:12.460 --> 00:25:13.460]   He called.
[00:25:13.460 --> 00:25:19.980]   You know, a common complaint that people have of Calvinism is that, "Well, if you're Calvinist
[00:25:19.980 --> 00:25:24.760]   and you believe in predestination, doesn't that make you passive?
[00:25:24.760 --> 00:25:27.560]   Doesn't that cause you to say, 'Well, I mean, if God is in full control, you know, I don't
[00:25:27.560 --> 00:25:29.580]   need to really need to do anything.'"
[00:25:29.580 --> 00:25:32.540]   That's exactly contrary.
[00:25:32.540 --> 00:25:37.420]   A nominal Christian, whether they're an Armenian or Calvinist, whether they're charismatic
[00:25:37.420 --> 00:25:41.700]   or non-charismatic, a nominal Christian will find nominal reason to do, to be a nominal
[00:25:41.700 --> 00:25:43.900]   Christian, right?
[00:25:43.900 --> 00:25:49.780]   So we can't determine right doctrine, wrong doctrine, simply be based upon some nominal
[00:25:49.780 --> 00:25:50.780]   Christian's response.
[00:25:50.780 --> 00:25:56.660]   A genuine Christian who's genuinely been saved, the doctrine of God's sovereignty actually
[00:25:56.660 --> 00:26:00.700]   empowers and strengthens us.
[00:26:00.700 --> 00:26:04.260]   Because the calling that you and I have received wasn't based upon the cleverness of other
[00:26:04.260 --> 00:26:05.260]   people.
[00:26:05.260 --> 00:26:08.620]   You know, a lot of times people think, "Well, I don't want to preach the gospel because
[00:26:08.620 --> 00:26:13.700]   if I preach the gospel, if I do it wrong, you know, I get one crack at it and if I mess
[00:26:13.700 --> 00:26:17.540]   it up and because I mess it up, they can't go to heaven, so I can't take that risk.
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:23.420]   So I'm going to bring him to the professionals at church and let the pastors preach the gospel.
[00:26:23.420 --> 00:26:24.420]   And I don't want to be that guy.
[00:26:24.420 --> 00:26:25.780]   I don't want that responsibility."
[00:26:25.780 --> 00:26:26.780]   Well, guess what?
[00:26:26.780 --> 00:26:29.380]   God didn't give you that responsibility.
[00:26:29.380 --> 00:26:34.620]   The way that somebody comes to Christ is because God has ordained the preaching of the gospel.
[00:26:34.620 --> 00:26:35.880]   Some people may do it better.
[00:26:35.880 --> 00:26:39.820]   Some people may be more logical or articulate.
[00:26:39.820 --> 00:26:46.080]   But it was the foolishness of the preaching of the gospel that downfounded the wisdom
[00:26:46.080 --> 00:26:48.180]   of this world.
[00:26:48.180 --> 00:26:56.140]   See, the reason why he empowers us is because God uses our foolishness and he ordains that.
[00:26:56.140 --> 00:27:00.020]   And the Holy Spirit is the one who convicts the world of sin, not me or you.
[00:27:00.020 --> 00:27:03.980]   Not because we did such a great job.
[00:27:03.980 --> 00:27:07.100]   And I know that some people think, you know, when we talk about the doctrine of predestination,
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:14.340]   they say, "Wow, what if my mom or dad, you know, and it's kind of sad if they were predetermined
[00:27:14.340 --> 00:27:19.700]   not to be saved, you know, I just can't live with that.
[00:27:19.700 --> 00:27:24.700]   So the doctrine of predestination just kind of, you know, causes me to be concerned.
[00:27:24.700 --> 00:27:26.740]   I mean, I can do nothing."
[00:27:26.740 --> 00:27:32.060]   Well, think about the flip side of that.
[00:27:32.060 --> 00:27:35.700]   So can you live with the fact that maybe because you went home and you got an argument with
[00:27:35.700 --> 00:27:41.900]   your dad or your brother or sister and because of that, that somebody that you love, because
[00:27:41.900 --> 00:27:46.660]   you made a mistake, because you weren't doing your quiet time, because you didn't pray enough,
[00:27:46.660 --> 00:27:50.180]   because you didn't do the right things and say it the right way, that because of that
[00:27:50.180 --> 00:27:51.940]   they're going to be going to hell forever?
[00:27:51.940 --> 00:27:52.940]   You can live with that?
[00:27:52.940 --> 00:27:55.540]   Somehow you feel more secure with that?
[00:27:55.540 --> 00:28:01.820]   I mean, think about anxiety.
[00:28:01.820 --> 00:28:04.940]   Think about the anxiousness that that would create.
[00:28:04.940 --> 00:28:12.260]   Instead of the people in your life that you love because you didn't do a good job, you
[00:28:12.260 --> 00:28:15.860]   know, you weren't perfect, that as a result of that they responded and they say they rejected
[00:28:15.860 --> 00:28:18.100]   God and that's your fault.
[00:28:18.100 --> 00:28:24.220]   See, this doctrine of security, election, predestination, and foreknowledge actually
[00:28:24.220 --> 00:28:30.500]   frees us because all God called us to do is to be faithful.
[00:28:30.500 --> 00:28:33.980]   To be faithful.
[00:28:33.980 --> 00:28:39.180]   I remember the guy who caused me to open my eyes and think about Christianity because
[00:28:39.180 --> 00:28:42.540]   prior to meeting Christ, I grew up in a Christian home.
[00:28:42.540 --> 00:28:46.740]   I never missed Sunday, you know, memorize scripture, the Lord's Prayer in Korean, English,
[00:28:46.740 --> 00:28:49.180]   and I knew all of that before.
[00:28:49.180 --> 00:28:52.700]   But I never really gave it a second thought until I went up to this retreat and this guy
[00:28:52.700 --> 00:28:55.380]   was cussing his head off.
[00:28:55.380 --> 00:28:58.700]   He was my smogger bleeder, you know, at the retreat.
[00:28:58.700 --> 00:29:03.300]   He was cussing his head off and he was telling me about his background and how he used to
[00:29:03.300 --> 00:29:09.500]   traffic trucks from Texas to California and then he, I'm thinking back at it, like he
[00:29:09.500 --> 00:29:17.740]   said all kinds of heresy and I think that guy should not have been a smogger bleeder.
[00:29:17.740 --> 00:29:20.260]   But God somehow used that.
[00:29:20.260 --> 00:29:24.940]   He didn't know, brand new Christian, but he was just excited about his faith and he was
[00:29:24.940 --> 00:29:32.780]   just telling us what happened to him and that caused me to, huh, maybe God is real.
[00:29:32.780 --> 00:29:34.500]   I never even gave it a second thought before.
[00:29:34.500 --> 00:29:36.060]   It's like maybe he really is real.
[00:29:36.060 --> 00:29:37.620]   Maybe I don't really know him.
[00:29:37.620 --> 00:29:43.220]   And that's what sparked my interest and caused me to pray and to seek him out.
[00:29:43.220 --> 00:29:47.380]   I'm not saying that preaching heresy is good or cussing, I'm not saying any of that, but
[00:29:47.380 --> 00:29:54.700]   how God uses foolishness of our faithfulness and our weakness to bring about his sovereign
[00:29:54.700 --> 00:29:57.140]   plan.
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:30:01.140]   That because God has ordained, because he foreknew you, he loved you, he predestined
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.660]   you, that God has orchestrated certain things in your life so that when you heard the gospel,
[00:30:05.660 --> 00:30:10.060]   it was his kindness, the Holy Spirit that was already working in you that led you to
[00:30:10.060 --> 00:30:11.060]   repentance.
[00:30:11.060 --> 00:30:16.140]   It wasn't because of the perfect presentation, it wasn't because somebody talented showed
[00:30:16.140 --> 00:30:21.300]   up, somebody who knew all their theology, it was just somebody who was just faithful,
[00:30:21.300 --> 00:30:22.300]   just telling you.
[00:30:22.300 --> 00:30:28.100]   You know, I bet you most of you didn't come to Christ because of a great theologian.
[00:30:28.100 --> 00:30:31.900]   Most of you did not come to Christ and gave your life to Jesus because somebody who has
[00:30:31.900 --> 00:30:36.700]   a PhD in theology expounded the depth of the word of God.
[00:30:36.700 --> 00:30:40.840]   I bet you it was your brother or sister or mom or dad or Sunday school teacher that really
[00:30:40.840 --> 00:30:47.600]   was just struggling themselves with their faith and in their weakness, they shared something
[00:30:47.600 --> 00:30:52.580]   with you that made sense and that caused you to come and continue to seek.
[00:30:52.580 --> 00:30:59.000]   See, we weren't aware of him, but it says in Romans 10, 13, it says, "For everyone
[00:30:59.000 --> 00:31:04.000]   who calls in the name of the Lord, they will be saved."
[00:31:04.000 --> 00:31:08.640]   Everyone who calls in the name of the Lord, they will be saved.
[00:31:08.640 --> 00:31:12.420]   The church is a gathering of called out people.
[00:31:12.420 --> 00:31:17.380]   That's literally, that's what the word, ecclesia means, gathering of called out people.
[00:31:17.380 --> 00:31:18.380]   That's me and you.
[00:31:18.380 --> 00:31:23.880]   In Acts 13, 48, Paul says, "And when the Gentiles heard this, they began rejoicing
[00:31:23.880 --> 00:31:25.600]   and glorifying the word of the Lord.
[00:31:25.600 --> 00:31:32.220]   And as many as were appointed to eternal life believed."
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:36.100]   You and I believe because we were appointed to believe.
[00:31:36.100 --> 00:31:42.980]   You and I believe because God foreknew us way before we were aware of him.
[00:31:42.980 --> 00:31:45.780]   And that's why we have eternal security.
[00:31:45.780 --> 00:31:48.740]   Not because you're at the right church, not because you have the right theology or you're
[00:31:48.740 --> 00:31:53.540]   more disciplined or smarter or more moral than the next person, but because God determined
[00:31:53.540 --> 00:31:54.540]   it.
[00:31:54.540 --> 00:31:57.540]   He was faithful to himself.
[00:31:57.540 --> 00:32:01.980]   Second Timothy 1, 8, "Therefore, do not be ashamed of the testimony about our Lord, nor
[00:32:01.980 --> 00:32:07.560]   of me, his prisoner, but share in suffering for the gospel by the power of God, who saved
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.820]   us and called us to a holy calling, not because of our works, but because of his own purpose
[00:32:12.820 --> 00:32:19.140]   and grace, which he gave us in Christ Jesus before the ages begun."
[00:32:19.140 --> 00:32:22.740]   That's why we have security.
[00:32:22.740 --> 00:32:23.740]   We have absolute security.
[00:32:23.740 --> 00:32:26.820]   And they said, "Those who foreknew, he predestined.
[00:32:26.820 --> 00:32:27.820]   Those who predestined, he called.
[00:32:27.820 --> 00:32:30.380]   And those he called, he justified."
[00:32:30.380 --> 00:32:33.740]   And I'm not going to go too deep into justification because we've been talking about that for
[00:32:33.740 --> 00:32:35.940]   the last maybe about a year.
[00:32:35.940 --> 00:32:39.660]   But that's how our justification came.
[00:32:39.660 --> 00:32:40.660]   It wasn't random.
[00:32:40.660 --> 00:32:43.260]   It didn't just show up all of a sudden.
[00:32:43.260 --> 00:32:45.500]   It was just randomly, just certain things happened.
[00:32:45.500 --> 00:32:49.020]   It was not random at all.
[00:32:49.020 --> 00:32:51.980]   It was sovereignly orchestrated.
[00:32:51.980 --> 00:32:53.740]   Maybe even where you were born.
[00:32:53.740 --> 00:32:57.120]   Even the things that you suffered.
[00:32:57.120 --> 00:32:59.940]   Even the pain you experienced.
[00:32:59.940 --> 00:33:06.580]   It was all sovereignly orchestrated to lead you to want Christ.
[00:33:06.580 --> 00:33:07.580]   Even the good things.
[00:33:07.580 --> 00:33:08.580]   Even the bad things.
[00:33:08.580 --> 00:33:09.580]   That's what he means by Romans 5.28.
[00:33:09.580 --> 00:33:10.580]   Romans 8.28.
[00:33:10.580 --> 00:33:14.340]   "Those who have been called according to his purpose."
[00:33:14.340 --> 00:33:15.780]   All things.
[00:33:15.780 --> 00:33:16.780]   All things.
[00:33:16.780 --> 00:33:22.460]   When we think about the suffering, think about the pain, think about the loneliness.
[00:33:22.460 --> 00:33:32.380]   Think about all of these things that God had orchestrated in your life to desire him more.
[00:33:32.380 --> 00:33:34.740]   It was not random.
[00:33:34.740 --> 00:33:36.780]   It was not random.
[00:33:36.780 --> 00:33:37.780]   It was predestined.
[00:33:37.780 --> 00:33:41.100]   And those he predestined, he says he called.
[00:33:41.100 --> 00:33:42.980]   Those he called, he justified.
[00:33:42.980 --> 00:33:46.660]   And then those he justified, he glorified.
[00:33:46.660 --> 00:33:49.300]   You notice that it's in the past tense.
[00:33:49.300 --> 00:33:53.580]   Typically, when we think about glorification, we think of it as a future tense.
[00:33:53.580 --> 00:33:55.340]   We will be glorified.
[00:33:55.340 --> 00:33:57.220]   One day we will be there.
[00:33:57.220 --> 00:33:59.380]   But Paul describes it as past tense.
[00:33:59.380 --> 00:34:00.820]   As if it just happened.
[00:34:00.820 --> 00:34:04.540]   It's done.
[00:34:04.540 --> 00:34:08.460]   He can say that because everything that he says will happen.
[00:34:08.460 --> 00:34:14.260]   The book of Revelation is not a book of really good guesses.
[00:34:14.260 --> 00:34:19.660]   The book of Revelation is revealing to us what is going to happen at the end.
[00:34:19.660 --> 00:34:25.260]   Now if God is not absolutely sovereign and he doesn't have control over history, he can't
[00:34:25.260 --> 00:34:26.900]   write the book of Revelation.
[00:34:26.900 --> 00:34:31.900]   Revelation should be a good guess.
[00:34:31.900 --> 00:34:34.820]   I hope this happens because you haven't done anything yet.
[00:34:34.820 --> 00:34:36.740]   So we're waiting to see what you're going to do.
[00:34:36.740 --> 00:34:40.300]   So Revelation shouldn't have never been written.
[00:34:40.300 --> 00:34:44.620]   But the reason why Revelation is written is because to God, past, present and future is
[00:34:44.620 --> 00:34:47.100]   the same.
[00:34:47.100 --> 00:34:50.380]   God is not a man that he should lie, nor the Son of Man that he should repent.
[00:34:50.380 --> 00:34:54.140]   Has he not said and will he not do it?
[00:34:54.140 --> 00:35:00.220]   He can say that because he's the only one who has absolute control.
[00:35:00.220 --> 00:35:04.040]   I know a lot of you guys already made New Year's resolutions and you probably broke
[00:35:04.040 --> 00:35:11.540]   some of it already because we're almost, what, eight days removed?
[00:35:11.540 --> 00:35:12.540]   I'm going to read the Bible.
[00:35:12.540 --> 00:35:18.700]   You read the first day and then the second day it's like, this is hard.
[00:35:18.700 --> 00:35:21.820]   The gym starts to clear out around February.
[00:35:21.820 --> 00:35:28.940]   Then March is when they start having sales because they need to get you back.
[00:35:28.940 --> 00:35:34.820]   We determine but we don't even know how we're going to feel tomorrow.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.060]   We make promises but we don't know if we're going to be able to carry that out.
[00:35:38.060 --> 00:35:43.460]   The longer we live, the less we are prone to believe in promises nor even give promises
[00:35:43.460 --> 00:35:47.700]   because we can't keep it.
[00:35:47.700 --> 00:35:51.300]   But our salvation is not random like that.
[00:35:51.300 --> 00:35:52.300]   It's on solid ground.
[00:35:52.300 --> 00:35:55.240]   That's why he says when you live according to the Word of God, it's like building your
[00:35:55.240 --> 00:35:58.220]   house on rock.
[00:35:58.220 --> 00:36:03.100]   If you just kind of live according to your will and your purpose, like sand.
[00:36:03.100 --> 00:36:07.740]   All it requires is a little bit of water coming and it just crumbles.
[00:36:07.740 --> 00:36:09.820]   That's how uncertain this life is.
[00:36:09.820 --> 00:36:14.420]   But our salvation is absolutely secure.
[00:36:14.420 --> 00:36:20.700]   You know, obviously you guys know I have a daughter, Faith.
[00:36:20.700 --> 00:36:24.620]   When she was born, the curse in our home was broken.
[00:36:24.620 --> 00:36:30.660]   It was just all boys of 40 years, first time we had a girl and we were so happy that we
[00:36:30.660 --> 00:36:31.940]   had a girl.
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:36.500]   And then the next thought we have is if one of these days some joker is going to show
[00:36:36.500 --> 00:36:42.820]   up, Mr. Kim, Pastor Peter, I would like to date your daughter.
[00:36:42.820 --> 00:36:47.460]   Esther and I always talk about that and say, well, when I talk to the young guy, I always
[00:36:47.460 --> 00:36:54.600]   tell him, now I'm speaking as a father, thinking about somebody is going to come to court and
[00:36:54.600 --> 00:36:56.260]   good luck.
[00:36:56.260 --> 00:37:02.380]   You know, we have so many men in her life looking out for her.
[00:37:02.380 --> 00:37:06.940]   But as a father, I'm saying, if you're going to come to my house and say, I want your daughter
[00:37:06.940 --> 00:37:07.940]   and I want to date her.
[00:37:07.940 --> 00:37:08.940]   And I said, why?
[00:37:08.940 --> 00:37:09.940]   Why do you want to date her?
[00:37:09.940 --> 00:37:16.420]   And it's like, you know, playing in the playground and when she runs, her ponytail jumps up and
[00:37:16.420 --> 00:37:19.420]   down and say, she's so cute.
[00:37:19.420 --> 00:37:22.420]   Boom, get out.
[00:37:22.420 --> 00:37:28.020]   It's like, I like the way she had the dimple in her house.
[00:37:28.020 --> 00:37:29.020]   Boom, get out.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:32.460]   I said, don't come to my house.
[00:37:32.460 --> 00:37:36.740]   And you just walked around and say, oh, you know, I like the way the sun shines off of
[00:37:36.740 --> 00:37:37.740]   her forehead.
[00:37:37.740 --> 00:37:42.500]   It's like, no, I'm not going to give you my precious daughter because you like the way
[00:37:42.500 --> 00:37:43.720]   she ties her hair.
[00:37:43.720 --> 00:37:44.720]   Get out of here.
[00:37:44.720 --> 00:37:45.720]   Right.
[00:37:45.720 --> 00:37:49.260]   I want to hear your plan.
[00:37:49.260 --> 00:37:51.220]   I want to hear your plan.
[00:37:51.220 --> 00:37:54.740]   You know, I've given my life to take care of my kids and my daughter.
[00:37:54.740 --> 00:38:00.140]   And I'm not going to just hand my daughter over to some guy just coming and say, yeah,
[00:38:00.140 --> 00:38:02.460]   you know, play with her for a while.
[00:38:02.460 --> 00:38:05.220]   And then if I change my mind, you know, I'll give her back.
[00:38:05.220 --> 00:38:07.220]   I said, get out.
[00:38:07.220 --> 00:38:08.220]   Right.
[00:38:08.220 --> 00:38:11.860]   I want to know that you're committed.
[00:38:11.860 --> 00:38:13.680]   I want to know you're serious.
[00:38:13.680 --> 00:38:16.940]   I want to know that you thought this out.
[00:38:16.940 --> 00:38:20.300]   I want to know what your plan is.
[00:38:20.300 --> 00:38:22.700]   So come to my house with a plan.
[00:38:22.700 --> 00:38:23.700]   OK.
[00:38:23.700 --> 00:38:25.220]   I'm giving you a heads up.
[00:38:25.220 --> 00:38:26.220]   Say, anybody in here.
[00:38:26.220 --> 00:38:31.540]   Come to my house with a plan.
[00:38:31.540 --> 00:38:32.540]   Like a man.
[00:38:32.540 --> 00:38:34.140]   Don't show up as a boy.
[00:38:34.140 --> 00:38:35.140]   Right.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:36.140]   Show up as a man.
[00:38:36.140 --> 00:38:37.140]   Right.
[00:38:37.140 --> 00:38:45.860]   Reason, again, the reason why I say all of this is because all of this is a description
[00:38:45.860 --> 00:38:49.340]   of his love for us.
[00:38:49.340 --> 00:38:50.500]   He was planned.
[00:38:50.500 --> 00:38:51.700]   He was determined.
[00:38:51.700 --> 00:38:52.700]   He knew us.
[00:38:52.700 --> 00:38:53.700]   He loved us.
[00:38:53.700 --> 00:38:55.420]   He chose us.
[00:38:55.420 --> 00:38:56.420]   He foreknew us.
[00:38:56.420 --> 00:38:57.420]   He predestined us.
[00:38:57.420 --> 00:38:58.420]   He called us.
[00:38:58.420 --> 00:39:00.420]   And that's why he justified us.
[00:39:00.420 --> 00:39:05.020]   And because he justified us, he glorified us.
[00:39:05.020 --> 00:39:08.260]   Period.
[00:39:08.260 --> 00:39:15.180]   If that doesn't inspire you to respond to him in love, I don't know what will.
[00:39:15.180 --> 00:39:22.500]   If that doesn't inspire you to trust him, to worship him, to follow him, to respond
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.940]   to this great mercy, according, again, in Romans chapter 12, in view of this great mercy,
[00:39:26.940 --> 00:39:33.300]   offer your bodies a living sacrifice, which is your reasonable response of worship.
[00:39:33.300 --> 00:39:35.400]   Reasonable.
[00:39:35.400 --> 00:39:39.580]   Sometimes we forget what it is that we have in Christ.
[00:39:39.580 --> 00:39:48.260]   And we complain about such trivial things, forgetting that you and I have been tagged
[00:39:48.260 --> 00:39:51.020]   by the love of Christ.
[00:39:51.020 --> 00:39:52.540]   Hebrews 6, 17 to 20.
[00:39:52.540 --> 00:39:57.680]   So when God desired to show more convincingly to the heirs of the promise the unchangeable
[00:39:57.680 --> 00:40:03.260]   character of his purpose, he guaranteed it with an oath so that by two unchangeable things
[00:40:03.260 --> 00:40:09.180]   in which it is impossible for God to lie, we who have fled for refuge might have strong
[00:40:09.180 --> 00:40:13.180]   encouragement to hold fast to the hope set before us.
[00:40:13.180 --> 00:40:18.020]   We have this as a sure and steadfast anchor of the soul, a hope that enters into the inner
[00:40:18.020 --> 00:40:23.100]   place behind the curtain where Jesus has gone as a forerunner on our behalf, having become
[00:40:23.100 --> 00:40:28.140]   high priest forever after the order of Melchizedek.
[00:40:28.140 --> 00:40:31.060]   Let's pray.
[00:40:31.060 --> 00:40:37.700]   Again, as we invite our praise team to come up, let's take some time to really come in
[00:40:37.700 --> 00:40:43.620]   for the Lord and meditation.
[00:40:43.620 --> 00:40:49.300]   And I don't know where you are right now in your walk with God, wherever you may be.
[00:40:49.300 --> 00:40:56.820]   I pray that these passages would serve as an absolute rock foundation for whatever it
[00:40:56.820 --> 00:40:59.360]   is that you do this week.
[00:40:59.360 --> 00:41:05.460]   You would respond to this love to live up to the calling that God has given and to meditate
[00:41:05.460 --> 00:41:08.100]   deeply.
[00:41:08.100 --> 00:41:12.700]   Let's take some time to pray, but when you pray, don't try so hard to be biblical.
[00:41:12.700 --> 00:41:14.620]   Don't try so hard to say the right things.
[00:41:14.620 --> 00:41:16.140]   Be honest.
[00:41:16.140 --> 00:41:19.120]   If you're weak, say, "I'm weak, Lord."
[00:41:19.120 --> 00:41:22.940]   If you're struggling in your faith, say, "Just admit that before God."
[00:41:22.940 --> 00:41:26.860]   Most powerful prayer is always the most honest one.
[00:41:26.860 --> 00:41:29.820]   So let's take some time as we come before the Lord in prayer as our worship team leads
