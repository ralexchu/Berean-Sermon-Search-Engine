[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000]   [Music]
[00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.520]   Well, why are we so content to go prayerless?
[00:00:07.520 --> 00:00:12.120]   To ask it another way, what is it that motivates our prayer lives?
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.160]   What can sustain us here? What breathes urgency and jump-starts our inner session?
[00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:23.360]   This seems like such a relevant topic for every Christian to ponder. And with that topic on the table today,
[00:00:23.360 --> 00:00:27.920]   we turn to a classic John Piper clip from a sermon he preached in the late
[00:00:28.520 --> 00:00:33.720]   1980s. It was sent in to us by Sommer who lives in Niceville, Florida.
[00:00:33.720 --> 00:00:39.280]   Thank you very much Sommer for sending this in. Here's Pastor John now addressing prayer neglect.
[00:00:39.280 --> 00:00:47.040]   Move a step farther when he talks about his ministry further. That was 1st Corinthians 9 26.
[00:00:47.040 --> 00:00:51.960]   This is 2nd Corinthians 10 3. Though we live in the world,
[00:00:51.960 --> 00:00:55.960]   we are not carrying on a worldly war.
[00:00:56.760 --> 00:01:01.840]   For the weapons of our warfare are not worldly, but have divine
[00:01:01.840 --> 00:01:03.600]   power.
[00:01:03.600 --> 00:01:05.600]   So ministry is war.
[00:01:05.600 --> 00:01:08.040]   Fighting for faith in my heart is war.
[00:01:08.040 --> 00:01:12.120]   Fighting for the souls of men is war. All
[00:01:12.120 --> 00:01:19.240]   aspects of the Christian life are war. And if I were to ask you, what's the most crucial text on warfare,
[00:01:19.240 --> 00:01:21.240]   you would all say what?
[00:01:21.240 --> 00:01:23.680]   Ephesians 6.
[00:01:23.680 --> 00:01:29.520]   Let's read a little bit of it. Ephesians 6 12. We are not contending against flesh and blood.
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.120]   We are contending against
[00:01:33.120 --> 00:01:39.520]   principalities and powers and the world rulers of this present darkness and
[00:01:39.520 --> 00:01:43.880]   spiritual forces, hosts in the heavenly places.
[00:01:43.880 --> 00:01:45.760]   Therefore,
[00:01:45.760 --> 00:01:51.960]   clothe yourself or put on the armor of God that you might be able to withstand and stand.
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:54.560]   And then comes the list of the armor.
[00:01:54.560 --> 00:01:59.400]   Life is war. The enemy is awesome.
[00:01:59.400 --> 00:02:03.080]   And you can't see him.
[00:02:03.080 --> 00:02:07.120]   Most people do not believe this.
[00:02:07.120 --> 00:02:12.600]   How you ever gonna get them to pray when they don't believe it?
[00:02:12.600 --> 00:02:16.480]   I mean, they'll say they believe it,
[00:02:16.480 --> 00:02:19.320]   but watch their lives.
[00:02:20.360 --> 00:02:25.280]   And there is a peacetime casualness in the church.
[00:02:25.280 --> 00:02:29.360]   A casualness about spiritual things.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:32.520]   There are no bombs falling in their lives.
[00:02:32.520 --> 00:02:39.920]   No bullets whizzing overhead. No mines to be avoided. No roars on the horizon.
[00:02:39.920 --> 00:02:44.920]   It's all well in America, the Disneyland of the universe.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:49.520]   Why pray?
[00:02:50.520 --> 00:02:52.280]   In wartime,
[00:02:52.280 --> 00:02:56.480]   newspapers carry headlines about how the troops are doing. In wartime,
[00:02:56.480 --> 00:03:01.720]   families get together and they talk about the sons and the daughters on the front lines and they pray with
[00:03:01.720 --> 00:03:08.520]   wrenching concern for their safety. In wartime, they're alert, they're armed, they're vigilant. In wartime,
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:11.920]   they spend their money so differently than in peacetime.
[00:03:11.920 --> 00:03:19.080]   There's austerity and simplicity of life, not because those are valuable in themselves, but because there's something so grand,
[00:03:19.080 --> 00:03:23.920]   there's such a great cause to spend your money on rather than padding your den.
[00:03:23.920 --> 00:03:27.680]   In wartime,
[00:03:27.680 --> 00:03:32.320]   everybody is touched. We all cut back. The luxury liner,
[00:03:32.320 --> 00:03:39.080]   you've read that great story that Ralph Winter has in the Perspectives book, the luxury liner becomes the troop carrier and once where they slept
[00:03:39.080 --> 00:03:43.240]   three, they sleep nine. Once where they had place settings of 15, they're 10 plates.
[00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:45.760]   Everything changes in wartime.
[00:03:47.360 --> 00:03:49.960]   And so it's clear people don't believe we're in a war.
[00:03:49.960 --> 00:03:59.240]   Every house has a candle till the boys come home in wartime.
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:07.840]   People don't believe that we're in a war that's worse than World War II, that is worse than any
[00:04:07.840 --> 00:04:11.480]   imaginable nuclear World War III.
[00:04:11.480 --> 00:04:15.160]   The casualties don't just lose an arm,
[00:04:16.960 --> 00:04:21.040]   they don't just lose a leg, they don't just lose one life,
[00:04:21.040 --> 00:04:24.440]   they lose everything forever
[00:04:24.440 --> 00:04:27.320]   in hell.
[00:04:27.320 --> 00:04:34.240]   I mean, if we believed that life is war, how different
[00:04:34.240 --> 00:04:37.080]   things would be.
[00:04:37.080 --> 00:04:42.800]   Now the connection with prayer and war is not left to our guesswork.
[00:04:44.080 --> 00:04:51.840]   Ephesians 617, listen to this connection. Sometimes the translations break the sentence up, miss the flow, but I'll read it the way it really is.
[00:04:51.840 --> 00:04:56.480]   Ephesians 617, take the helmet of salvation,
[00:04:56.480 --> 00:05:01.040]   the sword of the Spirit, which is the Word of God with all prayer,
[00:05:01.040 --> 00:05:08.480]   don't start a new sentence there, with all prayer and supplication, praying on every occasion in the Spirit, keeping awake
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.160]   with all perseverance. Now, it doesn't take any exegetical ability at all to see.
[00:05:14.160 --> 00:05:17.520]   Prayer is the power that wields the weapon.
[00:05:17.520 --> 00:05:23.240]   The sword of the Spirit, take it praying, take it praying, right?
[00:05:23.240 --> 00:05:26.920]   It's the power that wields the weapons of warfare.
[00:05:26.920 --> 00:05:29.720]   Prayer is not a
[00:05:29.720 --> 00:05:32.560]   civilian device.
[00:05:32.560 --> 00:05:34.800]   Now here's a text from John,
[00:05:35.280 --> 00:05:39.600]   chapter 15, verse 16, that takes a little bit of exegetical finesse,
[00:05:39.600 --> 00:05:44.160]   because not everybody is used to attending to conjunctions.
[00:05:44.160 --> 00:05:49.880]   I'm gonna read it very slowly, and I want you to listen for the word "so that,"
[00:05:49.880 --> 00:05:56.840]   and if you've got an NIV, they break the sentence and start with "then." Take that "then" as a logical, not a temporal "then."
[00:05:56.840 --> 00:06:04.480]   This is an absolutely crucial, logical connection if you're to understand the point of prayer in a life of war.
[00:06:04.960 --> 00:06:08.560]   John 15, 16, "You did not choose me,
[00:06:08.560 --> 00:06:11.320]   but I chose you and
[00:06:11.320 --> 00:06:16.720]   appointed you, that you go and bear fruit, and that your fruit would remain,
[00:06:16.720 --> 00:06:19.560]   so that
[00:06:19.560 --> 00:06:27.440]   whatever you ask the Father in my name, He may give it to you." Now, think, put on your thinking caps. Do you get it?
[00:06:27.440 --> 00:06:34.360]   Why is the Father going to answer the prayers that we make in Jesus' name?
[00:06:35.160 --> 00:06:41.200]   Answer? Because Jesus has given a mission to go bear fruit, or turn it around.
[00:06:41.200 --> 00:06:46.600]   Why did Jesus give us a mission to go bear fruit that would remain?
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:51.000]   So that we could enjoy getting answers to prayer.
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:53.760]   Therefore, why is there prayer?
[00:06:53.760 --> 00:06:56.120]   For war!
[00:06:56.120 --> 00:06:59.280]   For wartime, not for civilian times.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.000]   So I never tire of telling Bethlehem Baptist Church
[00:07:05.000 --> 00:07:08.760]   the number one reason why
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:13.200]   prayer
[00:07:13.200 --> 00:07:18.480]   malfunctions in the hands of believers is because they try to take a wartime
[00:07:18.480 --> 00:07:26.000]   walkie-talkie and turn it into a domestic intercom by which they ring up the maid to bring another pillow.
[00:07:26.000 --> 00:07:28.040]   It
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:30.040]   malfunctions. It's made for
[00:07:30.360 --> 00:07:37.480]   tanks. It's made for trenches. It's made for war. It won't work when you install it in your yacht.
[00:07:37.480 --> 00:07:47.280]   It won't work at the lake cabin. It won't work in the second and third and fourth car.
[00:07:47.280 --> 00:07:54.360]   So I want to give you a little rhyme. I didn't know it was a rhyme until I read my manuscript the second time.
[00:07:54.360 --> 00:07:57.120]   Just like that sentence.
[00:07:58.120 --> 00:08:05.720]   "Until we believe that life is war, we will not know what prayer is for."
[00:08:05.720 --> 00:08:07.800]   Will that stick?
[00:08:07.800 --> 00:08:12.480]   Until we believe that life is war, we will not know
[00:08:12.480 --> 00:08:15.280]   what prayer is for.
[00:08:15.280 --> 00:08:19.560]   Here's what I believe has happened.
[00:08:19.560 --> 00:08:22.880]   God sent his Son into the world on a mission.
[00:08:23.720 --> 00:08:28.000]   The Son comes to us and says, "My father wants me to extend my mission to you."
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:30.400]   It's dangerous.
[00:08:30.400 --> 00:08:32.320]   You can't lose.
[00:08:32.320 --> 00:08:34.320]   The mission will succeed.
[00:08:34.320 --> 00:08:38.240]   He's given me these transmitters here. I'll give each one of you a transmitter.
[00:08:38.240 --> 00:08:43.520]   They're coded to the General's frequency. As long as you stay in battle,
[00:08:43.520 --> 00:08:51.960]   fighting his war in his ways, you will always have free access by the transmitter to the General.
[00:08:53.280 --> 00:08:55.880]   Now go and use them.
[00:08:55.880 --> 00:09:00.640]   And I'll do whatever you ask for the war, for the cause.
[00:09:00.640 --> 00:09:04.400]   But what have millions of Americans done?
[00:09:04.400 --> 00:09:12.080]   They've stopped believing in war. Life is peace, not war. There's no urgency. There's no watching. There's no vigilance.
[00:09:12.080 --> 00:09:14.080]   There's no strategic planning.
[00:09:14.080 --> 00:09:16.120]   Just easy peacetime prosperity.
[00:09:16.120 --> 00:09:22.680]   And they take the walkie-talkie and they try to install it in domestic places, in luxurious places,
[00:09:22.680 --> 00:09:29.480]   and it won't work. They can't figure out why it's not working. It malfunctions. They're not getting any signals.
[00:09:29.480 --> 00:09:35.600]   And so my first point this morning is, if we're going to mobilize a
[00:09:35.600 --> 00:09:41.920]   movement of prayer in our churches and our cities, if we're going to just sustain a heart for prayer,
[00:09:41.920 --> 00:09:45.440]   we've just got to believe and feel
[00:09:45.440 --> 00:09:49.480]   that life
[00:09:49.480 --> 00:09:51.040]   is war.
[00:09:51.040 --> 00:09:58.480]   We must get into our minds a wartime mentality and get out of our minds the peacetime
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:05.720]   mentality that is driven into our minds all day long by television and radio and the newspapers and the magazines.
[00:10:05.720 --> 00:10:09.000]   They all say, "Don't you believe it?
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:11.880]   Pad your life.
[00:10:11.880 --> 00:10:15.680]   Peace. Peace when there is no peace."
[00:10:17.800 --> 00:10:22.640]   Until we feel the desperation of a bombing raid and the thrill of a new strategic offensive,
[00:10:22.640 --> 00:10:26.440]   we'll never pray with the Spirit of Jesus. That's point number one.
[00:10:26.440 --> 00:10:30.640]   Powerful clip. Classic Piper. And as you can tell, he was just getting started.
[00:10:30.640 --> 00:10:38.040]   The clip was taken from the message "Prayer, the Work of Missions," delivered at a missions conference in Denver on July 29th,
[00:10:38.040 --> 00:10:42.320]   1988. The entire message is available at DesiringGod.org.
[00:10:42.320 --> 00:10:45.840]   And of course, over the years, Pastor John has talked about the goodness of
[00:10:46.040 --> 00:10:51.240]   possessions and what they say about the generosity of the giver. That should also be factored in here.
[00:10:51.240 --> 00:10:56.560]   You can hear him explain this over and over throughout the years on this podcast in episodes
[00:10:56.560 --> 00:11:03.360]   55, 453, 849, 1135, and 1289.
[00:11:03.360 --> 00:11:07.440]   Nevertheless, this is a great clip sent in from Summer in Niceville, Florida.
[00:11:07.440 --> 00:11:12.920]   "Greetings, Pastor John and Tony," she wrote us. "I'm exceedingly grateful for your ministry and for this podcast.
[00:11:12.920 --> 00:11:17.600]   I don't recall when or where I first heard this clip on prayer, but it profoundly influenced me.
[00:11:17.600 --> 00:11:23.520]   It has become one of my favorite things to share with other women in discipleship settings to encourage them to pray.
[00:11:23.520 --> 00:11:31.840]   I am a military chaplain's wife and the war theme particularly resonates with military spouses in our current cultural climate.
[00:11:31.840 --> 00:11:36.400]   I think these words from Pastor John will be a bold and timely reminder of the spiritual war
[00:11:36.400 --> 00:11:40.280]   we wage and of the necessity of prayer to withstand the evil one.
[00:11:40.960 --> 00:11:46.960]   Amen." It is such a bold and timely reminder. Thank you, Summer. And thanks for listening to today's sermon clip.
[00:11:46.960 --> 00:11:48.360]   Our clips are crowdsourced.
[00:11:48.360 --> 00:11:53.240]   You tell us what bits of Piper's sermon has changed your life, and we will share that clip with the APJ audience.
[00:11:53.240 --> 00:11:59.920]   If you got one, email me. Give me your name, your hometown, the sermon title, the time stamp of where the clip happens in the audio,
[00:11:59.920 --> 00:12:05.560]   and tell me how it impacted you. Put the word "clip" in the subject line of an email and send it to me at
[00:12:05.560 --> 00:12:12.240]   askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org. That's an email address. Askpastorjohn@desiringgod.org.
[00:12:12.240 --> 00:12:18.960]   Well, of course, it's fitting for us to talk about praising and glorifying God. That is our calling and our great delight.
[00:12:18.960 --> 00:12:24.280]   But can we turn the tables and talk about God praising and glorifying us?
[00:12:24.280 --> 00:12:30.240]   This is a much more awkward question, but is it biblical to say that God will praise us?
[00:12:30.240 --> 00:12:34.280]   This is a fascinating question, and it's up next when we return on Friday.
[00:12:34.280 --> 00:12:39.080]   I'm here with Tony Reinke, and we are rejoined in studio with Pastor John next time. We'll see you then.
