[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:05.000]   - Hi, my name is Samantha Lee and I'm Tyler's sister.
[00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:11.620]   I'm currently a fourth year in college studying business.
[00:00:11.620 --> 00:00:14.720]   I grew up in a Christian household with Christian parents
[00:00:14.720 --> 00:00:18.440]   who brought me to church faithfully ever since I was a baby.
[00:00:18.440 --> 00:00:20.500]   I heard the Bible stories hundreds of times
[00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:24.580]   and at age five, proclaimed Jesus Christ as my savior.
[00:00:24.580 --> 00:00:25.780]   The words came out,
[00:00:25.780 --> 00:00:28.160]   but I didn't know what they truly meant.
[00:00:28.160 --> 00:00:30.000]   Then it seemed like every Sunday school after,
[00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:32.440]   I would pray the salvation prayer with my teacher
[00:00:32.440 --> 00:00:35.060]   just to make sure I wouldn't go to hell.
[00:00:35.060 --> 00:00:36.840]   Continuing into high school,
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:39.080]   outwardly I looked like a great Christian,
[00:00:39.080 --> 00:00:40.640]   serving in children's ministry,
[00:00:40.640 --> 00:00:43.000]   food pantries, and refreshments.
[00:00:43.000 --> 00:00:45.380]   At school, I worked hard and never partied,
[00:00:45.380 --> 00:00:47.700]   defining myself as a good worker for God,
[00:00:47.700 --> 00:00:50.060]   but never sharing the gospel.
[00:00:50.060 --> 00:00:52.160]   In reality, my actions were aimed
[00:00:52.160 --> 00:00:54.160]   to build and protect my own kingdom,
[00:00:54.160 --> 00:00:56.420]   not realizing that I was rotting in the comfort
[00:00:56.420 --> 00:00:59.720]   of my bitter thoughts, self-pity, and pride.
[00:00:59.720 --> 00:01:03.200]   All along, I justified sin by the flawed logic,
[00:01:03.200 --> 00:01:04.480]   allowing me to sincing fare
[00:01:04.480 --> 00:01:07.480]   for any horrible adversities thrown at me.
[00:01:07.480 --> 00:01:10.000]   Plus, I would even out my sin debt with good deeds,
[00:01:10.000 --> 00:01:11.640]   making me an A-plus Christian
[00:01:11.640 --> 00:01:14.760]   who would in turn receive a ticket out of hell.
[00:01:14.760 --> 00:01:16.600]   My faith had become solely work-based,
[00:01:16.600 --> 00:01:20.800]   independent of any need for Christ's sacrifice on the cross.
[00:01:20.800 --> 00:01:23.040]   Going into college, church became a place
[00:01:23.040 --> 00:01:26.280]   where I could just fulfill my Christianly social needs.
[00:01:26.280 --> 00:01:29.220]   My worth was in my own strength to follow God's laws
[00:01:29.220 --> 00:01:31.020]   in my friends and future,
[00:01:31.020 --> 00:01:33.580]   but when these were abruptly stripped away from me
[00:01:33.580 --> 00:01:36.780]   and I was left to sustain my own faith, I failed.
[00:01:36.780 --> 00:01:39.700]   The more that I forced myself to follow God's commandments,
[00:01:39.700 --> 00:01:41.400]   the deeper into sin I would fall,
[00:01:41.400 --> 00:01:44.940]   to the point where I couldn't even uphold my own standards.
[00:01:44.940 --> 00:01:46.780]   I saw the true ugliness of sin
[00:01:46.780 --> 00:01:49.940]   and how it has destroyed this world from the inside out.
[00:01:49.940 --> 00:01:51.500]   I was broken and wondered
[00:01:51.500 --> 00:01:53.500]   what I'd been believing my whole life.
[00:01:53.500 --> 00:01:55.500]   For months after, I desperately searched
[00:01:55.500 --> 00:01:59.580]   for the truth of my existence and I awed it back to God.
[00:01:59.580 --> 00:02:02.020]   Yet, I didn't understand how loving He is
[00:02:02.020 --> 00:02:04.300]   until one day I heard that believers
[00:02:04.300 --> 00:02:07.700]   are to be co-heirs with Christ in heaven forever.
[00:02:07.700 --> 00:02:10.360]   What did mankind do to deserve a glorified place
[00:02:10.360 --> 00:02:11.740]   with a holy God?
[00:02:11.740 --> 00:02:13.060]   Nothing.
[00:02:13.060 --> 00:02:16.020]   It was at the beginning of this year when I was saved.
[00:02:16.020 --> 00:02:19.540]   I was bounded for hell and had no ability
[00:02:19.540 --> 00:02:22.340]   to pay back even a fraction of my sin,
[00:02:22.340 --> 00:02:24.780]   but the Prince of Heaven could and did.
[00:02:24.780 --> 00:02:27.500]   He who never sinned was executed in my place
[00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:29.420]   to wash away my sins.
[00:02:29.420 --> 00:02:30.260]   From the beginning,
[00:02:30.260 --> 00:02:33.100]   Jesus knew how painful His journey to earth would be,
[00:02:33.100 --> 00:02:35.300]   yet out of an incomprehensible love,
[00:02:35.300 --> 00:02:38.420]   He still came and died for those who murdered Him.
[00:02:38.420 --> 00:02:40.480]   But His power over the universe was proven
[00:02:40.480 --> 00:02:43.180]   as He rose victoriously alive three days later,
[00:02:43.180 --> 00:02:44.980]   defeating death.
[00:02:44.980 --> 00:02:46.860]   The sin I once ran towards is a sin
[00:02:46.860 --> 00:02:48.580]   which Christ saved me from.
[00:02:48.580 --> 00:02:50.740]   I can no longer justify my wrongdoings,
[00:02:50.740 --> 00:02:53.260]   but come to God for forgiveness.
[00:02:53.260 --> 00:02:55.940]   Christ has changed me to become more genuine,
[00:02:55.940 --> 00:02:58.100]   helping me work through my struggles with others
[00:02:58.100 --> 00:03:01.940]   instead of secretly wallowing in self-pity and bitterness.
[00:03:01.940 --> 00:03:04.480]   I can live each day freely building a relationship
[00:03:04.480 --> 00:03:07.820]   with my Creator because I'm secured by His gift.
[00:03:07.820 --> 00:03:09.420]   There is nothing I could do to earn it,
[00:03:09.420 --> 00:03:12.980]   and there is no power in man or hell that can take it away.
[00:03:12.980 --> 00:03:16.480]   I will gladly consider my own kingdom and life as foolish
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:19.340]   in comparison to receiving an everlasting relationship
[00:03:19.340 --> 00:03:22.500]   with God who's prepared a beautiful place for His people,
[00:03:22.500 --> 00:03:25.700]   asking nothing in return but their broken hearts.
[00:03:25.700 --> 00:03:28.540]   As Paul said in Philippians 3, 8-9,
[00:03:28.540 --> 00:03:30.700]   "More than that, I count all things to be lost
[00:03:30.700 --> 00:03:32.860]   in the view of these surpassing value
[00:03:32.860 --> 00:03:34.740]   of knowing Christ Jesus my Lord,
[00:03:34.740 --> 00:03:37.440]   for whom I have suffered the loss of all things,
[00:03:37.440 --> 00:03:40.700]   and count them but rubbish so that I may gain Christ.
[00:03:40.700 --> 00:03:41.960]   And may be found in Him,
[00:03:41.960 --> 00:03:45.360]   not having a righteousness of my own derived from the law,
[00:03:45.360 --> 00:03:47.580]   but that which is their faith in Christ,
[00:03:47.580 --> 00:03:50.380]   the righteousness which comes from God
[00:03:50.380 --> 00:03:52.420]   on the basis of faith."
[00:03:52.420 --> 00:03:53.920]   I accept Christ as my Lord,
[00:03:53.920 --> 00:03:55.940]   not because I grew up hearing that,
[00:03:55.940 --> 00:03:58.260]   but because I'm too scared to go to hell.
[00:03:58.260 --> 00:04:01.100]   I accept Christ as my eternal King and Savior
[00:04:01.100 --> 00:04:03.080]   because He gently loves me to the point
[00:04:03.080 --> 00:04:05.060]   where He will pull me from death
[00:04:05.060 --> 00:04:07.560]   so that I might be His treasured daughter forever.
[00:04:07.560 --> 00:04:12.140]   (audience applauding)
