[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.960]   In front of many of us, many of us were so encouraged by witnessing his love for the
[00:00:09.960 --> 00:00:18.280]   word and his seriousness that he takes the call of elder to shepherd and to oversee this
[00:00:18.280 --> 00:00:19.280]   church.
[00:00:19.280 --> 00:00:21.400]   And so this is a part of what he does.
[00:00:21.400 --> 00:00:26.040]   He will do that also by feeding the sheep and helping us and training us and equipping
[00:00:26.040 --> 00:00:30.200]   us so that we might be able to go and do the work of ministry.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:35.000]   And so if you don't know Elder James, you at the very least know very well his wife,
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:37.440]   Diane Hong.
[00:00:37.440 --> 00:00:39.360]   She has been married to him for how long?
[00:00:39.360 --> 00:00:40.600]   How long have you guys been married?
[00:00:40.600 --> 00:00:41.600]   Five years?
[00:00:41.600 --> 00:00:43.980]   They've been married for five years.
[00:00:43.980 --> 00:00:49.720]   So they have been here at Berean, especially Elder James has been here for a very long
[00:00:49.720 --> 00:00:50.720]   time.
[00:00:50.720 --> 00:00:56.280]   And Diane, did you guys get married and then you came out, Diane?
[00:00:56.280 --> 00:00:57.280]   Right before?
[00:00:57.280 --> 00:00:58.280]   Okay.
[00:00:58.280 --> 00:01:00.360]   So it's not that you were coming out to Berean and then, okay.
[00:01:00.360 --> 00:01:04.760]   So I don't know what came first, if she loves Berean more or her husband more.
[00:01:04.760 --> 00:01:11.880]   So they are a great example of faith and even just the heart that they have, they pour their
[00:01:11.880 --> 00:01:13.840]   lives out for this church.
[00:01:13.840 --> 00:01:17.720]   And they have been a constant source of encouragement to me, both of them.
[00:01:17.720 --> 00:01:21.520]   And so with that said, we're going to actually just be inviting Elder James to come up and
[00:01:21.520 --> 00:01:23.380]   he's going to be teaching.
[00:01:23.380 --> 00:01:27.760]   And then after a little break, we're going to be having a Q&A after that he as well will
[00:01:27.760 --> 00:01:28.760]   be answering.
[00:01:28.760 --> 00:01:31.960]   So let's give him a round of applause as he comes on up.
[00:01:31.960 --> 00:01:36.160]   Is this on?
[00:01:36.160 --> 00:01:39.600]   Okay, sweet.
[00:01:39.600 --> 00:01:46.360]   So to answer that question, Diane definitely loves Berean more, but that's okay.
[00:01:46.360 --> 00:01:54.760]   So as we begin this seminar, I want you to know that this is a very dense topic.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.800]   I'm going to do my best to break this down into elements.
[00:01:58.800 --> 00:02:03.840]   I'm going to make it as elemental as possible so that it's easily digestible.
[00:02:03.840 --> 00:02:07.640]   But I got to tell you, I can only do so much.
[00:02:07.640 --> 00:02:14.680]   You are going to have to listen carefully and absorb what I'm telling you, digest it,
[00:02:14.680 --> 00:02:18.520]   and then at that point, you'll glean from it.
[00:02:18.520 --> 00:02:28.560]   But this is not something that will be understood unless you put your thinking cap on.
[00:02:28.560 --> 00:02:31.800]   It's just the way it is and you'll see why.
[00:02:31.800 --> 00:02:36.560]   So based on that, I'm going to pray and I'm going to give you a little introduction.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:45.840]   Father God, as we tackle this subject, Lord, we know that this is foundational, Lord, to
[00:02:45.840 --> 00:02:49.780]   how we view you and how we view the Word.
[00:02:49.780 --> 00:02:54.520]   My prayer, Lord God, is that for every brother and sister here who hears your voice, that
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:03:02.840]   it will be clear that they would have conviction in your Word, that there will be an internal
[00:03:02.840 --> 00:03:09.680]   renewing, Lord God, and reworking of their worldview if it is contradictory to one that
[00:03:09.680 --> 00:03:11.480]   is of the Bible.
[00:03:11.480 --> 00:03:15.960]   And so as we begin this morning, may you speak to your sheep.
[00:03:15.960 --> 00:03:18.480]   We pray these things in the name of your Son.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:19.480]   Amen.
[00:03:19.480 --> 00:03:25.600]   So when I was in college, right, and I was once in college, a long time ago, I was a
[00:03:25.600 --> 00:03:27.760]   freshman in 1999.
[00:03:27.760 --> 00:03:31.560]   The ARC had just opened.
[00:03:31.560 --> 00:03:38.200]   We had gotten T1 cable, but no Wi-Fi, so I carried a cable around.
[00:03:38.200 --> 00:03:40.400]   So it was a long time ago.
[00:03:40.400 --> 00:03:44.520]   But that's when I began to take my faith seriously.
[00:03:44.520 --> 00:03:49.320]   And one thing that I thought to myself was, "How do I know the Bible is true?
[00:03:49.320 --> 00:03:51.320]   How do I know?
[00:03:51.320 --> 00:03:53.720]   Why are there certain books in the Bible and not other books?
[00:03:53.720 --> 00:03:57.360]   Who got to decide?"
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:03:59.960]   Was someone just there and said, "That's Bible, that's not?"
[00:03:59.960 --> 00:04:01.880]   How did this work?
[00:04:01.880 --> 00:04:06.320]   And I'm sure many of you guys had that same question too.
[00:04:06.320 --> 00:04:08.400]   And this is the thing.
[00:04:08.400 --> 00:04:12.860]   As we go through this material, if you have questions, I want you to write them down and
[00:04:12.860 --> 00:04:14.960]   ask me at the end.
[00:04:14.960 --> 00:04:18.040]   Not in the middle, because I might answer some of your questions as I'm going through
[00:04:18.040 --> 00:04:19.500]   this.
[00:04:19.500 --> 00:04:25.000]   But I want your questions to be answered because I want your faith to be something that is
[00:04:25.000 --> 00:04:28.320]   internally held.
[00:04:28.320 --> 00:04:33.320]   Not because you're here and you have friends here and it's just something that we do.
[00:04:33.320 --> 00:04:36.120]   I want your faith to be genuine.
[00:04:36.120 --> 00:04:40.480]   And God is not afraid to answer your questions.
[00:04:40.480 --> 00:04:46.480]   So because God is not afraid to answer your questions, you should feel free to ask questions.
[00:04:46.480 --> 00:04:53.300]   At the same time, like I said before, it's going to take some mental effort.
[00:04:53.300 --> 00:04:55.200]   This is not an easy subject.
[00:04:55.200 --> 00:04:57.200]   It's not two plus two equals four.
[00:04:57.200 --> 00:04:58.840]   It's a little bit more like calculus.
[00:04:58.840 --> 00:05:03.160]   You can't just do calculus, maybe derivation.
[00:05:03.160 --> 00:05:05.160]   You can't do integration just lying on your bed.
[00:05:05.160 --> 00:05:09.600]   You got to sit up in your seat and you got to, wait, what comes second?
[00:05:09.600 --> 00:05:10.600]   Whatever.
[00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:12.120]   BC, Calc BC.
[00:05:12.120 --> 00:05:13.120]   Second semester.
[00:05:13.120 --> 00:05:16.160]   You have to sit there and you have to do the problem.
[00:05:16.160 --> 00:05:19.360]   This is kind of like that.
[00:05:19.360 --> 00:05:23.400]   The other thing I want you guys to think about is this.
[00:05:23.400 --> 00:05:24.400]   Truth.
[00:05:24.400 --> 00:05:25.400]   Truth.
[00:05:25.400 --> 00:05:26.400]   All truth.
[00:05:26.400 --> 00:05:27.400]   All truth.
[00:05:27.400 --> 00:05:37.600]   By nature, an inherent quality of truth is that it withstands the test of scrutiny.
[00:05:37.600 --> 00:05:41.000]   You guys know what the word scrutiny means, right?
[00:05:41.000 --> 00:05:46.800]   Everything that is true can withstand the test of scrutiny.
[00:05:46.800 --> 00:05:51.120]   Let me give you an easy, now if you're taking BCC, you've heard me give this example before,
[00:05:51.120 --> 00:05:52.640]   but I'll give it again.
[00:05:52.640 --> 00:05:54.040]   Two plus two is four.
[00:05:54.040 --> 00:05:55.840]   Very easy.
[00:05:55.840 --> 00:06:00.040]   No matter how much you scrutinize it, it will always be four.
[00:06:00.040 --> 00:06:02.360]   And it's universal.
[00:06:02.360 --> 00:06:04.120]   Laws of logic are universal.
[00:06:04.120 --> 00:06:10.400]   It doesn't matter whether you're here or in Cambodia or in Senegal or in, what's another
[00:06:10.400 --> 00:06:11.400]   part of the world?
[00:06:11.400 --> 00:06:13.400]   Or in Australia, right?
[00:06:13.400 --> 00:06:18.320]   It doesn't, Antarctica, it doesn't matter where you are in the world.
[00:06:18.320 --> 00:06:20.580]   Laws of logic are universal.
[00:06:20.580 --> 00:06:26.820]   In the same way, truth can withstand the test of scrutiny.
[00:06:26.820 --> 00:06:28.940]   And God's word is true.
[00:06:28.940 --> 00:06:34.100]   And because God's word is true, it can withstand the test of scrutiny.
[00:06:34.100 --> 00:06:40.660]   If something can withstand the test of scrutiny, you're more likely to believe it internally.
[00:06:40.660 --> 00:06:43.640]   You're more likely to believe it internally, right?
[00:06:43.640 --> 00:06:48.660]   If something is not true, you might derive some other benefit from it and you might act
[00:06:48.660 --> 00:06:54.820]   like you believe it, but you don't actually believe it.
[00:06:54.820 --> 00:07:00.980]   But God's word is true and it withstands the test of scrutiny.
[00:07:00.980 --> 00:07:02.940]   The canon of scripture.
[00:07:02.940 --> 00:07:04.900]   An overview of BCC Lesson 4.
[00:07:04.900 --> 00:07:10.540]   In BCC Lesson 4, I'm contrasting this with BCC Lesson 4.
[00:07:10.540 --> 00:07:15.260]   In BCC Lesson 4, we tell you the word of God is true because of its textual reliability,
[00:07:15.260 --> 00:07:19.140]   the number of existing manuscripts, the span of time between the original and the copy,
[00:07:19.140 --> 00:07:22.360]   the internal consistency among existing copies.
[00:07:22.360 --> 00:07:27.180]   Because of its extra-biblical witness, because of its archaeological confirmation, fulfilled
[00:07:27.180 --> 00:07:30.780]   prophecies, consistent witness, and because it says so.
[00:07:30.780 --> 00:07:35.140]   I'm not going to expand upon that because that's BCC Lesson 4, okay?
[00:07:35.140 --> 00:07:38.460]   So if you ever want to know, like if you ever want to refresh your course, just come to
[00:07:38.460 --> 00:07:40.100]   BCC Lesson 4.
[00:07:40.100 --> 00:07:44.700]   But we tell you that, that this is the outline, this is the skeletal outline of BCC Lesson
[00:07:44.700 --> 00:07:45.700]   4, okay?
[00:07:45.700 --> 00:07:49.780]   The canon of scripture is something a little different, okay?
[00:07:49.780 --> 00:07:53.220]   Canon is not canon, okay?
[00:07:53.220 --> 00:07:57.820]   C-A-N-O-N goes boom, okay?
[00:07:57.820 --> 00:08:01.460]   C-A-N-O-N does not go boom, okay?
[00:08:01.460 --> 00:08:05.420]   Canon comes from the Greek word kanon, which means rule or rod.
[00:08:05.420 --> 00:08:09.860]   This was specifically used in races where runners were supposed to stay in their lanes.
[00:08:09.860 --> 00:08:16.820]   So in the Greek Olympics, right, the canon is the line separating the other runners.
[00:08:16.820 --> 00:08:18.680]   So it's kind of like the rule.
[00:08:18.680 --> 00:08:20.260]   Canon is the rule, okay?
[00:08:20.260 --> 00:08:22.420]   The rule that judges everything else.
[00:08:22.420 --> 00:08:29.860]   So the canon of scripture refers to the books that are the authoritative word of God.
[00:08:29.860 --> 00:08:36.180]   Which books are the authoritative word of God, and that's what it's referring to, okay?
[00:08:36.180 --> 00:08:41.540]   Now this is easier if we go by Old Testament, and then we go by New Testament.
[00:08:41.540 --> 00:08:42.940]   Old Testament.
[00:08:42.940 --> 00:08:46.040]   Why is the Old Testament canon the canon?
[00:08:46.040 --> 00:08:50.660]   Why are the books that we have right now part of the Old Testament canon?
[00:08:50.660 --> 00:08:54.140]   Why are the books that we have right now in the Old Testament the authoritative word of
[00:08:54.140 --> 00:08:55.140]   God?
[00:08:55.140 --> 00:08:56.540]   Because there are other books that were left out.
[00:08:56.540 --> 00:08:57.980]   Why is that the case?
[00:08:57.980 --> 00:09:02.480]   Well, Christ confirms the Old Testament canon.
[00:09:02.480 --> 00:09:05.160]   He confirms the Old Testament canon, right?
[00:09:05.160 --> 00:09:09.500]   He says, "If he called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the scripture cannot
[00:09:09.500 --> 00:09:14.820]   be broken," he didn't say, "If he called them gods to whom the word of God came, and the
[00:09:14.820 --> 00:09:17.580]   scripture cannot be broken," except for this one book you have here.
[00:09:17.580 --> 00:09:18.620]   This is wrong.
[00:09:18.620 --> 00:09:20.780]   You shouldn't have inserted this book into the Old Testament.
[00:09:20.780 --> 00:09:22.140]   He doesn't say that.
[00:09:22.140 --> 00:09:25.860]   All he says is, "And the scripture cannot be broken," right?
[00:09:25.860 --> 00:09:29.580]   He also says, "Now he said to them, 'These are my words which I spoke to you while I
[00:09:29.580 --> 00:09:34.340]   was still with you, that all the prophets which are written about me in the law of Moses,
[00:09:34.340 --> 00:09:37.180]   prophets, and the Psalms must be fulfilled.'"
[00:09:37.180 --> 00:09:40.300]   Moses, prophets, and the Psalms.
[00:09:40.300 --> 00:09:45.740]   Again, he's not saying, "Hey, you know the books that you consider the Old Testament?
[00:09:45.740 --> 00:09:48.380]   They're right except for this book."
[00:09:48.380 --> 00:09:53.540]   Or he didn't say, "The law of Moses, the prophets, and the Psalms, but you forgot this other
[00:09:53.540 --> 00:09:54.540]   book.
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:56.620]   This is actually also the word of God, and you forgot to include it."
[00:09:56.620 --> 00:09:58.860]   He didn't do that, okay?
[00:09:58.860 --> 00:10:01.060]   And he would have done that if that was the case.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:06.100]   I don't think he's going around healing people, being the Messiah, and there's a book that
[00:10:06.100 --> 00:10:10.340]   actually should have been included that he doesn't tell us about.
[00:10:10.340 --> 00:10:12.540]   That's not how it ... He doesn't do that.
[00:10:12.540 --> 00:10:17.360]   In actuality, he confirms the Old Testament canon, okay?
[00:10:17.360 --> 00:10:22.140]   Another example, "But Jesus answered and said to them, 'You are mistaken, not understanding
[00:10:22.140 --> 00:10:24.860]   the scriptures nor the power of God.'"
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:30.540]   He's again confirming the books that are part of the Old Testament canon.
[00:10:30.540 --> 00:10:40.700]   Matthew 5, 18, 26, 53, 256, John 53, John 5, 39 to 47 say the same thing.
[00:10:40.700 --> 00:10:43.540]   Christ confirmed Old Testament events and authors, right?
[00:10:43.540 --> 00:10:48.780]   Here, he says Abel was real, talked about Noah and the flood, Daniel and Isaiah, that
[00:10:48.780 --> 00:10:53.660]   Moses wrote the Pentateuch, Isaiah wrote Isaiah, Jonah wrote Jonah, Daniel wrote Daniel.
[00:10:53.660 --> 00:10:56.080]   I mean, you get the picture, right?
[00:10:56.080 --> 00:10:59.280]   He didn't say, "Oh, that story about Noah and the flood?
[00:10:59.280 --> 00:11:00.740]   All a myth.
[00:11:00.740 --> 00:11:01.740]   Just kidding about that."
[00:11:01.740 --> 00:11:03.900]   He didn't say, "Well, his name wasn't Abel.
[00:11:03.900 --> 00:11:08.780]   It was actually James," or ... He doesn't say that, right?
[00:11:08.780 --> 00:11:11.980]   He confirms all these events of the Old Testament.
[00:11:11.980 --> 00:11:15.020]   If they were not real, guess what he would have done?
[00:11:15.020 --> 00:11:16.760]   He would have told us, right?
[00:11:16.760 --> 00:11:18.060]   But he doesn't do that.
[00:11:18.060 --> 00:11:23.260]   Instead, he calls it the very Word of God.
[00:11:23.260 --> 00:11:27.380]   Bible discoveries confirm the Old Testament canon.
[00:11:27.380 --> 00:11:32.700]   The Masoretic text, the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Samaritan Pentateuch, the Nash Papyrus,
[00:11:32.700 --> 00:11:35.220]   the Silver Amulets, and the Septuagint.
[00:11:35.220 --> 00:11:36.920]   I want to highlight two.
[00:11:36.920 --> 00:11:38.580]   There's more, but I want to highlight two.
[00:11:38.580 --> 00:11:41.020]   The Masoretic text, okay?
[00:11:41.020 --> 00:11:45.700]   The Masoretes were known to faithfully preserve the Old Testament.
[00:11:45.700 --> 00:11:46.700]   That's who they were.
[00:11:46.700 --> 00:11:55.180]   They were kind of like a tribal clan that were devoted to making sure the scriptures
[00:11:55.180 --> 00:11:56.720]   were accurate.
[00:11:56.720 --> 00:11:59.260]   That is what they were known for, okay?
[00:11:59.260 --> 00:12:07.060]   For a long period of time, the entire Old Testament canon was derived from the Masoretes.
[00:12:07.060 --> 00:12:11.100]   Faithful Jews would use the Masoretic text.
[00:12:11.100 --> 00:12:15.340]   The Masoretic text, though, dated back to about 1000 AD.
[00:12:15.340 --> 00:12:18.580]   900 to 1000 AD, around there, okay?
[00:12:18.580 --> 00:12:25.220]   So kind of like instinctually you think, okay, it doesn't seem like it now.
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:29.740]   There's no reason to not have faith in that for all the reasons that I will get into.
[00:12:29.740 --> 00:12:35.620]   But it spans about a thousand years from the time of Christ.
[00:12:35.620 --> 00:12:37.420]   The Dead Sea Scrolls.
[00:12:37.420 --> 00:12:39.700]   The Dead Sea Scrolls.
[00:12:39.700 --> 00:12:42.660]   Now in 1947, there's this farmer dude, okay?
[00:12:42.660 --> 00:12:46.140]   And this farmer dude went in some caves.
[00:12:46.140 --> 00:12:52.380]   And in caves, he found a treasure trove of scrolls dating back to the Qumran community
[00:12:52.380 --> 00:12:53.860]   of the Essenes, okay?
[00:12:53.860 --> 00:12:58.060]   What's great about that is, what's great about that is, these manuscripts that go back to
[00:12:58.060 --> 00:13:02.740]   the Qumran community, they date to before the time of Christ to right around the time
[00:13:02.740 --> 00:13:04.660]   of Christ, okay?
[00:13:04.660 --> 00:13:11.620]   Which was, and that's great, because remember, Christ confirms the Old Testament canon, right?
[00:13:11.620 --> 00:13:17.380]   So if Christ confirms the Old Testament canon, we just need to know, what was he looking
[00:13:17.380 --> 00:13:18.380]   at at the time?
[00:13:18.380 --> 00:13:22.220]   I hope everyone's following me with that, okay?
[00:13:22.220 --> 00:13:24.620]   Christ confirms the Old Testament canon.
[00:13:24.620 --> 00:13:30.060]   So if he confirms the Old Testament canon, what did he have at the time with respect
[00:13:30.060 --> 00:13:32.020]   to the Old Testament?
[00:13:32.020 --> 00:13:35.660]   We go to the Dead Sea Scrolls, there's about a thousand manuscripts belonging to the Qumran
[00:13:35.660 --> 00:13:39.420]   community, it validates the Masoretic Text.
[00:13:39.420 --> 00:13:42.220]   It just completely validates the Masoretic Text.
[00:13:42.220 --> 00:13:45.260]   So the Masoretic Text was accurate, okay?
[00:13:45.260 --> 00:13:51.340]   We already knew that, but the Dead Sea Scrolls, going back to the time of Christ, confirms
[00:13:51.340 --> 00:13:54.180]   the Masoretic Text, okay?
[00:13:54.180 --> 00:13:57.700]   Now fundamentally, I want you guys to understand this, okay?
[00:13:57.700 --> 00:14:00.900]   I don't want to take this for granted, okay?
[00:14:00.900 --> 00:14:04.200]   Whatever Christ said was true.
[00:14:04.200 --> 00:14:06.740]   Whatever Christ said was true.
[00:14:06.740 --> 00:14:09.140]   That is foundational.
[00:14:09.140 --> 00:14:15.580]   And Christ himself says, "If you don't believe me, at least believe because of the works."
[00:14:15.580 --> 00:14:17.380]   He gave a very logical argument.
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:20.020]   You don't believe I'm the son of God?
[00:14:20.020 --> 00:14:22.460]   Then what am I doing, right?
[00:14:22.460 --> 00:14:24.240]   What am I doing?
[00:14:24.240 --> 00:14:27.660]   This guy couldn't hear, and now he could hear.
[00:14:27.660 --> 00:14:30.440]   This guy couldn't see, and now he could see.
[00:14:30.440 --> 00:14:34.880]   My friend Lazarus over there, the guy you know, Lazarus, he was dead, but I raised him
[00:14:34.880 --> 00:14:36.360]   from the dead.
[00:14:36.360 --> 00:14:44.320]   So if he has shown you, okay, by this arsenal of works, then you can believe him.
[00:14:44.320 --> 00:14:46.660]   Let me give you another example, okay?
[00:14:46.660 --> 00:14:50.460]   Let me give you one that correlates to us, okay?
[00:14:50.460 --> 00:14:53.240]   Common day, like modern day reality, okay?
[00:14:53.240 --> 00:15:00.080]   If I told you that I could fly, if I told you I can fly, nobody would believe me.
[00:15:00.080 --> 00:15:01.140]   You wouldn't believe me?
[00:15:01.140 --> 00:15:04.960]   Or you would think maybe he has a Jetman Dubai pack or something, right?
[00:15:04.960 --> 00:15:07.000]   The Iron Man dude, right?
[00:15:07.000 --> 00:15:08.000]   That's what you would think.
[00:15:08.000 --> 00:15:09.060]   And I say, "No, no, no, no.
[00:15:09.060 --> 00:15:10.480]   I could fly inherently.
[00:15:10.480 --> 00:15:12.280]   I could just intrinsically fly.
[00:15:12.280 --> 00:15:13.740]   Nobody would believe me."
[00:15:13.740 --> 00:15:18.920]   The first best thing would be to show you, would just fly, right?
[00:15:18.920 --> 00:15:21.220]   Then you might be like, "Oh, you can actually fly."
[00:15:21.220 --> 00:15:24.800]   But you know what else I can do that might make you believe me?
[00:15:24.800 --> 00:15:28.840]   I'll go out there, and I'll lift a car with one hand.
[00:15:28.840 --> 00:15:30.000]   I'll lift a car with one hand.
[00:15:30.000 --> 00:15:34.120]   Now, that's not directly related to flying, but you'll be like, "Oh, this guy can lift
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:35.640]   a car with one hand.
[00:15:35.640 --> 00:15:37.640]   Maybe he can fly.
[00:15:37.640 --> 00:15:38.640]   Maybe he can fly."
[00:15:38.640 --> 00:15:42.420]   Things would start, like, loosening up to you, right?
[00:15:42.420 --> 00:15:44.780]   So my point is this, right?
[00:15:44.780 --> 00:15:50.120]   In a similar way, in a similar way, when Jesus says, "I am the Son of God, and if you don't
[00:15:50.120 --> 00:15:55.200]   believe me, at least believe because of the works," his situation was even more precise
[00:15:55.200 --> 00:15:59.960]   because the Messiah was predicted to do what Jesus did.
[00:15:59.960 --> 00:16:03.100]   The Messiah would come, and he would what?
[00:16:03.100 --> 00:16:04.200]   He would heal people.
[00:16:04.200 --> 00:16:06.400]   He would physically heal people.
[00:16:06.400 --> 00:16:10.920]   And it's not like miracles are happening every day in the Middle East.
[00:16:10.920 --> 00:16:12.240]   Just every year, there's a miracle.
[00:16:12.240 --> 00:16:13.680]   No, miracles never happen.
[00:16:13.680 --> 00:16:16.740]   Just like us today, they never happened.
[00:16:16.740 --> 00:16:21.720]   And so the validator, one of the validators of the Messiah was not only the fact that
[00:16:21.720 --> 00:16:27.360]   he was going to be born here, he was going to be of this tribe, and he was going to be
[00:16:27.360 --> 00:16:29.880]   some odd years after Cyrus.
[00:16:29.880 --> 00:16:31.540]   Those are all validators.
[00:16:31.540 --> 00:16:37.440]   But the other validator of the power of the Messiah was he was going to make the mute
[00:16:37.440 --> 00:16:43.540]   speak, make the dumb hear, make the blind see, and raise the dead.
[00:16:43.540 --> 00:16:45.200]   And who does that?
[00:16:45.200 --> 00:16:46.600]   Christ does that.
[00:16:46.600 --> 00:16:50.420]   So when Christ does that, he's exhibiting his power.
[00:16:50.420 --> 00:16:54.620]   So he's making a very logical argument to the Jews of the day, "You don't believe I'm
[00:16:54.620 --> 00:16:55.620]   the Son of God."
[00:16:55.620 --> 00:16:57.720]   Okay, you don't believe I'm the Son of God.
[00:16:57.720 --> 00:16:59.920]   Then how am I doing all these works?
[00:16:59.920 --> 00:17:03.320]   Because as you know, the Messiah was going to do all these works.
[00:17:03.320 --> 00:17:11.540]   And that is the same thing, the same question that he posits to every unbeliever here today.
[00:17:11.540 --> 00:17:14.860]   Everyone in the world, maybe even in this room.
[00:17:14.860 --> 00:17:20.400]   If you don't think that he has the power to do that, then what do you make of every single
[00:17:20.400 --> 00:17:23.520]   miracle that he's ever, ever done?
[00:17:23.520 --> 00:17:25.960]   And you might say, "Well, there's a problem, Mr. James.
[00:17:25.960 --> 00:17:31.040]   The problem is I wasn't around at the time."
[00:17:31.040 --> 00:17:37.020]   But a lot of people that saw the risen Christ perform these miracles recorded them.
[00:17:37.020 --> 00:17:43.680]   Even those who were antagonistic to Christ the Messiah recorded that he did these miracles
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:45.840]   because it was undeniable.
[00:17:45.840 --> 00:17:51.400]   People who saw the risen Christ perform these miracles were put to death because they couldn't
[00:17:51.400 --> 00:17:52.400]   deny that truth.
[00:17:52.400 --> 00:17:53.400]   Okay?
[00:17:53.400 --> 00:17:57.160]   So I don't want to take anything for granted, but when I say Christ confirms the Old Testament
[00:17:57.160 --> 00:18:03.080]   canon, there's a huge underpinning, there's a huge foundational understanding of why that's
[00:18:03.080 --> 00:18:05.040]   important.
[00:18:05.040 --> 00:18:07.700]   That's important because of who he is.
[00:18:07.700 --> 00:18:13.000]   And therefore, knowing who he is, if he confirms the Old Testament canon, then all we need
[00:18:13.000 --> 00:18:17.560]   to do is find out what was the Old Testament at the time.
[00:18:17.560 --> 00:18:22.800]   This tells us, the Masoretic text and the finding of the dead sea scrolls, it tells
[00:18:22.800 --> 00:18:27.400]   us the Masoretic text at the time, excuse me, the Old Testament canon at the time is
[00:18:27.400 --> 00:18:28.960]   the Old Testament that we have today.
[00:18:28.960 --> 00:18:32.680]   It is the same Old Testament the Jews use today.
[00:18:32.680 --> 00:18:33.720]   Okay?
[00:18:33.720 --> 00:18:35.800]   So that's a little dense, okay?
[00:18:35.800 --> 00:18:39.000]   But I wanted to do that so that I take nothing for granted, okay?
[00:18:39.000 --> 00:18:42.280]   That's the Old Testament canon, and I'm done with the Old Testament canon.
[00:18:42.280 --> 00:18:44.560]   Let's move to the New Testament canon.
[00:18:44.560 --> 00:18:50.160]   And the reason the Old Testament canon is a lot easier is this, okay?
[00:18:50.160 --> 00:18:55.680]   The Old Testament canon is confirmed by Christ very explicitly, just like I told you, right?
[00:18:55.680 --> 00:19:01.080]   But Christ dies, resurrects, and then the New Testament is written.
[00:19:01.080 --> 00:19:04.240]   So the analysis is a little bit different, right?
[00:19:04.240 --> 00:19:10.120]   He doesn't resurrect, go to heaven, come back and say, "The New Testament that you have,
[00:19:10.120 --> 00:19:11.120]   it's legit."
[00:19:11.120 --> 00:19:12.680]   He doesn't do that, right?
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:15.960]   With the Old Testament, he said, "It's legit."
[00:19:15.960 --> 00:19:17.760]   But he doesn't do that with the New Testament.
[00:19:17.760 --> 00:19:22.320]   So our analysis is a little bit different in relation to the canon from the Old Testament
[00:19:22.320 --> 00:19:24.080]   and the New Testament, okay?
[00:19:24.080 --> 00:19:27.440]   So the New Testament canon, let's talk about criterion, okay?
[00:19:27.440 --> 00:19:30.240]   An evaluation of the canon must have established criteria.
[00:19:30.240 --> 00:19:32.600]   It must.
[00:19:32.600 --> 00:19:38.000]   But because the criteria is necessarily, in a sense, greater than what is being judged,
[00:19:38.000 --> 00:19:41.160]   the model for the canon must be self-authenticating, okay?
[00:19:41.160 --> 00:19:42.160]   All right.
[00:19:42.160 --> 00:19:46.960]   I want to take some time to break this down, okay?
[00:19:46.960 --> 00:19:53.280]   When you have a criteria, that criteria is usually greater than the thing being judged.
[00:19:53.280 --> 00:19:56.420]   Let me give you another example, okay?
[00:19:56.420 --> 00:19:59.840]   When you have a show like American Idol or whatever, Masked Singer or whatever these
[00:19:59.840 --> 00:20:00.840]   shows, right?
[00:20:00.840 --> 00:20:05.320]   The people that are judging these singers are usually professional singers, right?
[00:20:05.320 --> 00:20:07.880]   And they're usually good professional singers, right?
[00:20:07.880 --> 00:20:14.440]   It would be weird if you had someone who never sang a tune, who knew nothing about singing,
[00:20:14.440 --> 00:20:16.160]   judging these other singers.
[00:20:16.160 --> 00:20:17.640]   That wouldn't make any sense.
[00:20:17.640 --> 00:20:18.640]   So what do you do?
[00:20:18.640 --> 00:20:24.360]   You take a judge who is experienced, because that person can be a faithful judge of what
[00:20:24.360 --> 00:20:26.560]   good singing actually is.
[00:20:26.560 --> 00:20:29.440]   Now, all this is not new to you, right?
[00:20:29.440 --> 00:20:30.960]   But I'm trying to paint the picture.
[00:20:30.960 --> 00:20:36.520]   When I say this, when I make this statement, the criteria is, in a sense, greater than
[00:20:36.520 --> 00:20:39.280]   what is being judged, we all agree on that.
[00:20:39.280 --> 00:20:44.400]   You might not cognizantly understand it, but we all kind of subtly understand it to ourselves
[00:20:44.400 --> 00:20:45.920]   internally, okay?
[00:20:45.920 --> 00:20:53.280]   So because that's the case, because that is the case, the model has to be self-authenticating,
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:55.760]   because what is greater than the Word of God?
[00:20:55.760 --> 00:20:56.760]   What is greater?
[00:20:56.760 --> 00:20:59.800]   There's nothing that's greater than the Word of God, okay?
[00:20:59.800 --> 00:21:03.160]   Now in the past, a canon was validated using the following components.
[00:21:03.160 --> 00:21:06.600]   First, first-perception, historical origins, okay?
[00:21:06.600 --> 00:21:12.680]   What I mean by that is, traditionally, when we looked at the study of the canon, right,
[00:21:12.680 --> 00:21:19.200]   we typically looked at the early church, what did they receive, and/or historically, what
[00:21:19.200 --> 00:21:20.720]   book came first in time.
[00:21:20.720 --> 00:21:25.560]   Now, that's not necessarily wrong, but the problem is, the early church is not greater
[00:21:25.560 --> 00:21:27.880]   than the Word of God.
[00:21:27.880 --> 00:21:33.160]   Coming first in time does not make you greater than the Word of God.
[00:21:33.160 --> 00:21:37.960]   I mean, if heresy sprouted up before the book of Revelation, that doesn't make, the heresy
[00:21:37.960 --> 00:21:40.880]   is not greater than the book of Revelation, right?
[00:21:40.880 --> 00:21:45.140]   So in of itself, that's not how you judge the canon, that shouldn't be how you judge
[00:21:45.140 --> 00:21:49.480]   the canon, because that's not greater than the canon, okay?
[00:21:49.480 --> 00:21:53.480]   The following components seem to emerge, okay?
[00:21:53.480 --> 00:21:57.200]   Divine qualities, apostolic origins, and corporate reception.
[00:21:57.200 --> 00:21:58.800]   I'm gonna go over all this, okay?
[00:21:58.800 --> 00:22:05.400]   So when we are doing a faithful investigation of the canon of Scripture, these are the three
[00:22:05.400 --> 00:22:06.600]   things that you wanna look at.
[00:22:06.600 --> 00:22:11.600]   I'm gonna explain each of them to you, and as I explain them to you, you're going to
[00:22:11.600 --> 00:22:13.320]   understand why, okay?
[00:22:13.320 --> 00:22:15.680]   But I wanna give you a heads up.
[00:22:15.680 --> 00:22:20.560]   Divine qualities, apostolic origins, and corporate reception.
[00:22:20.560 --> 00:22:23.600]   Before I move on to the next slide, okay?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:31.600]   Because something is self-authenticating does not mean it is unfair or cheap.
[00:22:31.600 --> 00:22:32.600]   Does not mean that.
[00:22:32.600 --> 00:22:36.640]   You think, "Oh, something is something because it says so."
[00:22:36.640 --> 00:22:38.040]   That doesn't make something cheap, okay?
[00:22:38.040 --> 00:22:41.560]   Let me give you an example, alright?
[00:22:41.560 --> 00:22:47.040]   If you were, okay, to judge whether or not this phone is actually real, your sensory
[00:22:47.040 --> 00:22:52.240]   perception, you wanna judge whether your sensory perception is actually real.
[00:22:52.240 --> 00:22:54.320]   What would you do?
[00:22:54.320 --> 00:22:56.360]   You would rely on your sensory perception.
[00:22:56.360 --> 00:22:57.660]   You would touch this phone.
[00:22:57.660 --> 00:23:00.380]   You would ask someone else, "Do you see that phone?"
[00:23:00.380 --> 00:23:09.400]   You would employ your senses because everything that is foundational is self-authenticating.
[00:23:09.400 --> 00:23:14.400]   Everything that is foundational is self-authenticating, okay?
[00:23:14.400 --> 00:23:17.280]   You can't get more basic than elements.
[00:23:17.280 --> 00:23:19.800]   Elements are what you start out with, okay?
[00:23:19.800 --> 00:23:27.000]   So not only with respect to the canon of scripture, anything that is true, any element that is
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:32.400]   true will be self-authenticating, okay?
[00:23:32.400 --> 00:23:35.400]   Prove that the number, prove that two is two.
[00:23:35.400 --> 00:23:36.400]   You can't do that.
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:37.800]   Two is just two.
[00:23:37.800 --> 00:23:41.600]   It is a foundational requirement that two is two, right?
[00:23:41.600 --> 00:23:45.700]   If you're an artist in here, primary colors, right?
[00:23:45.700 --> 00:23:50.740]   You can mix other colors, but there are primary colors that are what they are.
[00:23:50.740 --> 00:23:53.380]   You can't get more basic than the primary colors.
[00:23:53.380 --> 00:23:58.580]   The other colors that come after the primary colors are based on the foundational colors,
[00:23:58.580 --> 00:23:59.620]   right?
[00:23:59.620 --> 00:24:04.400]   In life, things that are foundational, not just the canon of scripture, anything in life
[00:24:04.400 --> 00:24:08.940]   that is foundational is self-authenticating, okay?
[00:24:08.940 --> 00:24:13.020]   That doesn't make it any less true, okay?
[00:24:13.020 --> 00:24:14.980]   You'll see why in a second.
[00:24:14.980 --> 00:24:17.980]   Okay, so let's go to divine qualities, okay?
[00:24:17.980 --> 00:24:21.260]   When I say divine qualities, when I say divine qualities, right?
[00:24:21.260 --> 00:24:22.740]   When I say divine, okay?
[00:24:22.740 --> 00:24:25.860]   I don't mean good, I don't mean great, right?
[00:24:25.860 --> 00:24:29.300]   I don't mean like a dessert you eat, oh my gosh, it's so divine, right?
[00:24:29.300 --> 00:24:30.300]   No.
[00:24:30.300 --> 00:24:38.220]   When I say divine, I mean the word divine in its just pure intellectual sense, godlike,
[00:24:38.220 --> 00:24:39.660]   of God.
[00:24:39.660 --> 00:24:46.740]   So when you look at which scriptures are the authoritative word of God, they must exhibit
[00:24:46.740 --> 00:24:49.800]   a godlike nature to them, okay?
[00:24:49.800 --> 00:24:51.600]   That's what I mean when I say divine qualities.
[00:24:51.600 --> 00:24:53.780]   So when you look at scripture, right?
[00:24:53.780 --> 00:24:55.420]   Psalm 19, 1.
[00:24:55.420 --> 00:25:00.580]   The heavens declare the glory of God, and the sky above proclaims his handiwork.
[00:25:00.580 --> 00:25:04.700]   So that the natural attests to God, were not the scriptures, okay?
[00:25:04.700 --> 00:25:05.700]   Romans 1, 20.
[00:25:05.700 --> 00:25:09.860]   Since the creation of the world, his invisible attributes, his eternal power, and divine
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:13.100]   nature would have been clearly seen, being understood through what has been made, so
[00:25:13.100 --> 00:25:14.860]   that they are without excuse.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.820]   If general revelation speaks of God, how much more would special revelation?
[00:25:19.820 --> 00:25:26.620]   If nature speaks of God, how much more his word, his explicit word, okay?
[00:25:26.620 --> 00:25:27.620]   Scripture brings wisdom.
[00:25:27.620 --> 00:25:29.680]   Psalm 1, 19, 98.
[00:25:29.680 --> 00:25:31.380]   It provides light to dark paths.
[00:25:31.380 --> 00:25:33.100]   Psalm 1, 19, 105.
[00:25:33.100 --> 00:25:34.580]   It gives joy to the heart.
[00:25:34.580 --> 00:25:36.180]   It gives understanding to the mind.
[00:25:36.180 --> 00:25:37.540]   It gives peace and comfort.
[00:25:37.540 --> 00:25:39.100]   It exposes sin and guilt.
[00:25:39.100 --> 00:25:42.260]   It leads to prosperity and blessing, okay?
[00:25:42.260 --> 00:25:46.780]   Again, when you look at scripture, it does these things.
[00:25:46.780 --> 00:25:51.580]   There is no other work that does these things, okay?
[00:25:51.580 --> 00:25:55.380]   Now the early church fathers agreed on the divinity of scriptures.
[00:25:55.380 --> 00:25:59.580]   Now I know this might seem to have a little bit less weight, okay?
[00:25:59.580 --> 00:26:04.240]   But the reason why it shouldn't is because when you look at that the early church fathers
[00:26:04.240 --> 00:26:09.220]   are a fancy word for saying, you know, there's the apostles and there are the people who
[00:26:09.220 --> 00:26:12.380]   are discipled by the apostles directly, okay?
[00:26:12.380 --> 00:26:16.540]   And then there are people who are discipled directly by the people right underneath them
[00:26:16.540 --> 00:26:17.540]   and so on, okay?
[00:26:17.540 --> 00:26:21.940]   And you get to a point in time and it cuts off, but generally speaking, those are the
[00:26:21.940 --> 00:26:23.660]   early church fathers, okay?
[00:26:23.660 --> 00:26:26.940]   So for example, if you were an apostle Peter's small group, okay?
[00:26:26.940 --> 00:26:31.660]   You would have been an early church, well, and you met the criterion for being elder,
[00:26:31.660 --> 00:26:34.560]   at the very least you would need to do that and you could theoretically be an early church
[00:26:34.560 --> 00:26:35.560]   father.
[00:26:35.560 --> 00:26:40.680]   Not that there was like a ad in the paper, that's not what I'm saying, but they're disciples,
[00:26:40.680 --> 00:26:41.680]   okay?
[00:26:41.680 --> 00:26:43.840]   These are their disciples, okay?
[00:26:43.840 --> 00:26:47.600]   So understanding the nature of scripture, right?
[00:26:47.600 --> 00:26:51.520]   And being exposed, being the first one, so to speak, to be exposed to it are some of
[00:26:51.520 --> 00:26:52.520]   these people.
[00:26:52.520 --> 00:26:56.040]   So Jerome stated that Philemon was a document which has in it so much of the beauty of the
[00:26:56.040 --> 00:26:57.040]   gospel.
[00:26:57.040 --> 00:27:01.360]   Clement stated that no one will be so impressed by the exhortations of any of the saints as
[00:27:01.360 --> 00:27:04.040]   he is by the words of the Lord himself.
[00:27:04.040 --> 00:27:07.920]   Origen defends Hebrews on the grounds that the ideas of the epistle are magnificent and
[00:27:07.920 --> 00:27:10.400]   say that the gospels are accompanied with divine power.
[00:27:10.400 --> 00:27:14.700]   Irenaeus said the gospels are always breathing out immortality on every side and vivifying
[00:27:14.700 --> 00:27:17.360]   men afresh.
[00:27:17.360 --> 00:27:24.960]   If you have spent time in the scriptures, then you know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:24.960 --> 00:27:31.320]   There is no other document, there is no other work of antiquity that speaks to your soul
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:33.320]   like the scriptures.
[00:27:33.320 --> 00:27:37.080]   If you haven't, then this is just like, well, some men said so to you, okay?
[00:27:37.080 --> 00:27:42.680]   I mean, I can't do much about that, but if you have experienced the power of God through
[00:27:42.680 --> 00:27:48.840]   the scriptures, if they have brought salvation to you, if they have exposed you, right?
[00:27:48.840 --> 00:27:54.560]   Exposed your sin, exposed your guilt, and at the same time healing you, you should understand
[00:27:54.560 --> 00:27:56.800]   that no other document does that.
[00:27:56.800 --> 00:28:02.800]   No man or woman could have written you a letter and have the same effect on you, okay?
[00:28:02.800 --> 00:28:09.040]   Moreover, if you look at the doctrinal unity of scripture, the precise doctrinal unity
[00:28:09.040 --> 00:28:14.840]   it gets right and is consistent with the nature of God, the nature of man, the nature of sin,
[00:28:14.840 --> 00:28:17.680]   the authority of scripture, the nature of the church, the person of Christ, the work
[00:28:17.680 --> 00:28:20.960]   of Christ, the holiness, redemption.
[00:28:20.960 --> 00:28:28.280]   These are topics that are not just broad in scope, but that are easy to be inconsistent
[00:28:28.280 --> 00:28:32.200]   with, because they are so broad in scope.
[00:28:32.200 --> 00:28:39.040]   And not only are they so broad in scope, but man over the course of history, especially
[00:28:39.040 --> 00:28:46.120]   in different time periods and different cultures, would not have doctrinal unity, okay?
[00:28:46.120 --> 00:28:52.520]   What we thought in this culture, even in America, right, now in the 90s is completely different.
[00:28:52.520 --> 00:28:56.360]   And I know, because I was alive at the time, right?
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.480]   Even if you go back to the 80s, it was completely different, right?
[00:29:00.480 --> 00:29:03.880]   And I don't want to get into politics, like, "Oh, it's more like left," or whatever else,
[00:29:03.880 --> 00:29:04.880]   right?
[00:29:04.880 --> 00:29:09.600]   My only point is, it is what was acceptable today is not necessarily what was acceptable
[00:29:09.600 --> 00:29:10.880]   in the 90s.
[00:29:10.880 --> 00:29:14.520]   And the same would have been true if you lived through the 90s, right?
[00:29:14.520 --> 00:29:22.320]   What was acceptable in the 90s is not necessarily what was acceptable in the 70s, and so forth.
[00:29:22.320 --> 00:29:30.040]   The ideals and values seem to change over time, especially across cultures.
[00:29:30.040 --> 00:29:36.920]   The Bible, right, beginning from Genesis to Revelation, was written over a period of about
[00:29:36.920 --> 00:29:39.440]   1500 years.
[00:29:39.440 --> 00:29:40.960]   Different men.
[00:29:40.960 --> 00:29:42.240]   Different time periods.
[00:29:42.240 --> 00:29:44.480]   Different languages.
[00:29:44.480 --> 00:29:50.960]   But there is this precise unity with respect to these topics.
[00:29:50.960 --> 00:29:57.880]   And these topics are not, they're not like mathematical equations.
[00:29:57.880 --> 00:30:03.720]   They are abstract concepts, but yet there is precise unity with them.
[00:30:03.720 --> 00:30:05.320]   Okay?
[00:30:05.320 --> 00:30:08.220]   Now, redemptive historical unity.
[00:30:08.220 --> 00:30:14.280]   From Genesis to Revelation, the Bible is telling the same overarching redemptive story of God.
[00:30:14.280 --> 00:30:16.920]   Reconciling himself to mankind.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:18.720]   There's structural unity, okay?
[00:30:18.720 --> 00:30:23.440]   The Gospels seem to correlate with the historical narratives that recount redemption.
[00:30:23.440 --> 00:30:26.240]   The Epistles and the Prophets seem to have similarities in their expansion upon God's
[00:30:26.240 --> 00:30:27.240]   redemptive work.
[00:30:27.240 --> 00:30:31.680]   Revelation and Deuteronomy both speak of blessings and cursings, and the warning against editing.
[00:30:31.680 --> 00:30:32.680]   Okay.
[00:30:32.680 --> 00:30:36.040]   When I say the Gospels seem to correlate with the historical narratives that recount redemption,
[00:30:36.040 --> 00:30:37.040]   right?
[00:30:37.040 --> 00:30:39.680]   I'm going to talk about this more later, right?
[00:30:39.680 --> 00:30:46.280]   But when you see the nation of Israel come out of Egypt, you have redemption, and then
[00:30:46.280 --> 00:30:50.160]   you have the expansion of that work, right?
[00:30:50.160 --> 00:30:51.560]   Via the other books.
[00:30:51.560 --> 00:30:52.560]   Okay?
[00:30:52.560 --> 00:30:53.840]   The Gospels seem to do that.
[00:30:53.840 --> 00:30:54.840]   Okay?
[00:30:54.840 --> 00:31:00.800]   You have the Gospels, and then you have the expansion of that work via the Epistles.
[00:31:00.800 --> 00:31:02.800]   That's my point.
[00:31:02.800 --> 00:31:04.880]   Okay?
[00:31:04.880 --> 00:31:05.880]   Canonical structure.
[00:31:05.880 --> 00:31:11.160]   Moses, Elijah, David, the Law, the Prophets, and the Psalms.
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.840]   Plus Gospels, the Acts in General Epistles, Pauline Epistles, and Revelation would be
[00:31:15.840 --> 00:31:18.400]   seen as a uniform seven sections.
[00:31:18.400 --> 00:31:19.840]   Okay?
[00:31:19.840 --> 00:31:23.120]   Seven is a number for completeness in the Bible.
[00:31:23.120 --> 00:31:24.600]   Right?
[00:31:24.600 --> 00:31:25.680]   Seven days in a week.
[00:31:25.680 --> 00:31:27.440]   Who created that?
[00:31:27.440 --> 00:31:28.440]   God created that.
[00:31:28.440 --> 00:31:29.440]   Okay?
[00:31:29.440 --> 00:31:32.280]   So when you look at Moses, Elijah, David, right?
[00:31:32.280 --> 00:31:35.960]   Plus the New Testament structure, it adds up to seven, right?
[00:31:35.960 --> 00:31:37.760]   In Genesis, seven plays a key role.
[00:31:37.760 --> 00:31:40.320]   In Revelation, the number seven plays a key role.
[00:31:40.320 --> 00:31:41.920]   Seven is representative of completeness.
[00:31:41.920 --> 00:31:42.920]   Okay?
[00:31:42.920 --> 00:31:45.040]   Let me give you another example of that.
[00:31:45.040 --> 00:31:46.040]   Okay?
[00:31:46.040 --> 00:31:47.320]   In Genesis and Revelation, right?
[00:31:47.320 --> 00:31:49.160]   In Genesis, you have the creation of the earth.
[00:31:49.160 --> 00:31:51.520]   In Revelation, you have the recreation of heaven and earth.
[00:31:51.520 --> 00:31:53.360]   In Genesis, you have paradise and Eden.
[00:31:53.360 --> 00:31:55.120]   In Revelation, you have paradise and heaven.
[00:31:55.120 --> 00:31:57.040]   In Genesis, you have the theme of marriage.
[00:31:57.040 --> 00:31:59.160]   In Revelation, you have the great wedding of the lamb.
[00:31:59.160 --> 00:32:01.280]   In Genesis, you have the serpent's deception.
[00:32:01.280 --> 00:32:03.280]   In Revelation, you have the serpent's destruction.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:05.600]   The curse upon the world, the curse is lifted.
[00:32:05.600 --> 00:32:08.840]   Tree of life, tree of life, God dwells with his people.
[00:32:08.840 --> 00:32:09.840]   God dwells with his people.
[00:32:09.840 --> 00:32:11.840]   You seem to have bookends.
[00:32:11.840 --> 00:32:14.160]   How interesting.
[00:32:14.160 --> 00:32:16.680]   The number seven plays a key role in Genesis.
[00:32:16.680 --> 00:32:19.800]   The number seven plays a key role in Revelation.
[00:32:19.800 --> 00:32:23.760]   There is the beginning with respect to the content of Revelation.
[00:32:23.760 --> 00:32:28.960]   There is the redemption, the fulfillment, the end, whatever you want to call it, contained
[00:32:28.960 --> 00:32:32.880]   within the structure and the content of the book of Revelation.
[00:32:32.880 --> 00:32:36.960]   They seem to be nice bookends to each other.
[00:32:36.960 --> 00:32:39.080]   How did that happen?
[00:32:39.080 --> 00:32:41.920]   How did that happen?
[00:32:41.920 --> 00:32:43.760]   Okay.
[00:32:43.760 --> 00:32:44.760]   Divine qualities.
[00:32:44.760 --> 00:32:47.880]   That was divine qualities, okay?
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:51.120]   I'm going on to apostolic origins.
[00:32:51.120 --> 00:32:53.080]   Apostolic origins.
[00:32:53.080 --> 00:32:58.560]   As I continue to speak about points number two and points number three, okay?
[00:32:58.560 --> 00:33:05.880]   What I'm beginning to show you is, right, the word of God is the word of God because
[00:33:05.880 --> 00:33:08.360]   of these three points.
[00:33:08.360 --> 00:33:12.760]   And these three points are self-impressing on us, okay?
[00:33:12.760 --> 00:33:14.560]   They are self-authenticating.
[00:33:14.560 --> 00:33:16.000]   I'm going to wrap that up at the end.
[00:33:16.000 --> 00:33:17.880]   I'm going to wrap that up at the end.
[00:33:17.880 --> 00:33:21.200]   But I want to kind of get you in that mindset, okay?
[00:33:21.200 --> 00:33:29.720]   The word of God, if the word was God, he's going to impress it upon his people, all right?
[00:33:29.720 --> 00:33:30.720]   Okay.
[00:33:30.720 --> 00:33:34.960]   The old covenant was accepted as having been a compilation of documents.
[00:33:34.960 --> 00:33:35.960]   You don't believe me?
[00:33:35.960 --> 00:33:39.400]   It says right here, Exodus 24, the book of the covenant.
[00:33:39.400 --> 00:33:41.520]   Exodus 34, he wrote the words of the covenant.
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.520]   Deuteronomy 29, the covenant written in this book.
[00:33:44.520 --> 00:33:47.160]   Paul calls the Old Testament the old covenant.
[00:33:47.160 --> 00:33:52.120]   So the old covenant was a compilation of documents.
[00:33:52.120 --> 00:33:54.600]   That's what the old covenant was, right?
[00:33:54.600 --> 00:33:59.480]   So it's not like when we get to the New Testament, it's like this new strange concept.
[00:33:59.480 --> 00:34:04.440]   The skeletal structure for the New Testament canon is already there because in the Old
[00:34:04.440 --> 00:34:08.720]   Testament, they understood it as a compilation of documents.
[00:34:08.720 --> 00:34:12.820]   Second Corinthians 3.14 says this, "But their minds were hardened for until this very day
[00:34:12.820 --> 00:34:17.120]   at the reading of the old covenant, the same veil remains unlifted because it is removed
[00:34:17.120 --> 00:34:18.520]   in Christ."
[00:34:18.520 --> 00:34:25.680]   The Old Testament is the old covenant, and the old covenant was a compilation of documents,
[00:34:25.680 --> 00:34:27.080]   right?
[00:34:27.080 --> 00:34:32.080]   But the apostles were ministers of the new covenant, okay?
[00:34:32.080 --> 00:34:37.320]   So you have the old covenant, it's a compilation of documents, and then you have the old covenant,
[00:34:37.320 --> 00:34:39.280]   and then you have a new covenant, okay?
[00:34:39.280 --> 00:34:43.220]   So if you're a Jew and you know that the Old Testament is a compilation of documents and
[00:34:43.220 --> 00:34:47.600]   you're waiting for this new covenant, it's not gonna be a surprise to you that the New
[00:34:47.600 --> 00:34:52.760]   Testament, right, the new covenant is going to be a compilation of documents, okay?
[00:34:52.760 --> 00:34:57.620]   Jeremiah 31, "Behold, days are coming, declares the Lord, when I will make a new covenant
[00:34:57.620 --> 00:34:59.660]   with the house of Israel and with the house of Judah."
[00:34:59.660 --> 00:35:03.820]   Matthew 26.28, "For this is my blood of the covenant which is poured out for many for
[00:35:03.820 --> 00:35:04.940]   forgiveness of sins."
[00:35:04.940 --> 00:35:11.820]   Second Corinthians 3.6, "Which also made us adequate as servants of a new covenant, not
[00:35:11.820 --> 00:35:16.240]   of the letter but of the spirit, for the letter kills but the spirit gives life."
[00:35:16.240 --> 00:35:18.640]   The old covenant is a compilation of documents.
[00:35:18.640 --> 00:35:23.360]   When you hear about this new covenant, it's going to also be a compilation of documents,
[00:35:23.360 --> 00:35:24.440]   okay?
[00:35:24.440 --> 00:35:27.520]   Consider the redemption motif in the Old Testament, okay?
[00:35:27.520 --> 00:35:28.520]   Consider this, okay?
[00:35:28.520 --> 00:35:30.200]   I am the Lord your God.
[00:35:30.200 --> 00:35:32.300]   I bring you out of Egypt.
[00:35:32.300 --> 00:35:34.480]   And then what happens?
[00:35:34.480 --> 00:35:35.740]   He gives you books.
[00:35:35.740 --> 00:35:36.960]   He gives you commandments.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:37.960]   He tells you what to do.
[00:35:37.960 --> 00:35:39.560]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:35:39.560 --> 00:35:46.000]   So there's redemption and then there's words that are related to this redemption?
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:47.880]   Is that what happened in the Old Testament?
[00:35:47.880 --> 00:35:49.180]   Yes, it did.
[00:35:49.180 --> 00:35:54.240]   He saves you and after he saves you, he gives you instructions.
[00:35:54.240 --> 00:35:56.820]   He expands upon that, right?
[00:35:56.820 --> 00:35:59.760]   That's what happened in the Old Testament.
[00:35:59.760 --> 00:36:02.520]   The promises of blessings and cursings, the copies of the covenant.
[00:36:02.520 --> 00:36:05.080]   Isaiah was directed to write prophecies on scrolls.
[00:36:05.080 --> 00:36:09.200]   The New Testament states that the Jews were entrusted with the oracles of God, right?
[00:36:09.200 --> 00:36:12.420]   So there's a pattern here already, right?
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:16.160]   Once there's redemption, God tells you about this redemption.
[00:36:16.160 --> 00:36:17.480]   He gives you an identity.
[00:36:17.480 --> 00:36:22.080]   He gives you instructions and the prophets remind them of this when they fall, okay?
[00:36:22.080 --> 00:36:24.560]   So this is not anything new.
[00:36:24.560 --> 00:36:28.600]   When we get to the New Testament, what do we have?
[00:36:28.600 --> 00:36:29.880]   We have redemption, right?
[00:36:29.880 --> 00:36:32.760]   Jesus dies on the cross.
[00:36:32.760 --> 00:36:36.320]   There's forgiveness of sins and then we have instructions.
[00:36:36.320 --> 00:36:37.560]   How do you run a church?
[00:36:37.560 --> 00:36:38.980]   Who am I now in Christ?
[00:36:38.980 --> 00:36:41.120]   What is the power that I have in Christ?
[00:36:41.120 --> 00:36:46.080]   It's the same exact pattern, okay?
[00:36:46.080 --> 00:36:48.920]   How would this message go to the nations, right?
[00:36:48.920 --> 00:36:53.200]   Jesus commissioned his apostles so that they might be with him and he might send them out
[00:36:53.200 --> 00:36:57.320]   to preach and have authority to cast out demons, right?
[00:36:57.320 --> 00:37:01.560]   He also said to the apostles that he was sending out his apostles as Jesus was sent out by
[00:37:01.560 --> 00:37:02.680]   the Father.
[00:37:02.680 --> 00:37:06.060]   Peter stated that the apostles were chosen by God as witnesses.
[00:37:06.060 --> 00:37:09.520]   Why is apostolic origins important?
[00:37:09.520 --> 00:37:10.920]   Why?
[00:37:10.920 --> 00:37:12.640]   Why is it important?
[00:37:12.640 --> 00:37:15.080]   Yes, they were with Christ.
[00:37:15.080 --> 00:37:20.400]   Yes, they were with Christ as he's doing ministry.
[00:37:20.400 --> 00:37:26.520]   But very specifically, Jesus is saying of his apostles that he's commissioning them
[00:37:26.520 --> 00:37:31.600]   and he's giving them his authority that they're gonna be chosen by God as witnesses.
[00:37:31.600 --> 00:37:35.720]   That's very directly what Jesus said about the apostles.
[00:37:35.720 --> 00:37:38.760]   That is why apostolic origins is so important.
[00:37:38.760 --> 00:37:43.180]   He didn't say, he didn't say that about everyone across time.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:46.440]   If he did, then we'd all be writing the New Testament.
[00:37:46.440 --> 00:37:47.640]   And guess what?
[00:37:47.640 --> 00:37:49.480]   We're not doing that, right?
[00:37:49.480 --> 00:37:55.760]   The reason we're not doing that is contained within the parameters of scripture, okay?
[00:37:55.760 --> 00:37:59.720]   I'm gonna go on and I'm gonna show you some more passages, okay?
[00:37:59.720 --> 00:38:04.360]   The apostles were likened to the Old Testament prophets, which means they have the authority
[00:38:04.360 --> 00:38:06.080]   to speak God's word.
[00:38:06.080 --> 00:38:07.400]   Second Peter 3.2.
[00:38:07.400 --> 00:38:11.480]   You should remember the predictions of the holy prophets and the commandment of the Lord
[00:38:11.480 --> 00:38:13.040]   and Savior through your apostles.
[00:38:13.040 --> 00:38:14.040]   Well, that's interesting.
[00:38:14.040 --> 00:38:17.720]   What did he just do here?
[00:38:17.720 --> 00:38:18.720]   Remember the holy prophets.
[00:38:18.720 --> 00:38:20.320]   Who's he referring to?
[00:38:20.320 --> 00:38:23.000]   Isaiah, Jeremiah, Daniel, Ezekiel, right?
[00:38:23.000 --> 00:38:25.000]   Haggai, Malachi, Amos, right?
[00:38:25.000 --> 00:38:30.840]   They accepted them as messengers of God, right?
[00:38:30.840 --> 00:38:32.360]   There's no debate there.
[00:38:32.360 --> 00:38:34.200]   There's absolutely no debate.
[00:38:34.200 --> 00:38:36.360]   Those guys were of God.
[00:38:36.360 --> 00:38:40.480]   But what else does Peter say?
[00:38:40.480 --> 00:38:46.340]   And the commandment of the Lord and Savior through your apostles.
[00:38:46.340 --> 00:38:49.280]   He puts the prophets on par with the apostles.
[00:38:49.280 --> 00:38:51.960]   You guys see that?
[00:38:51.960 --> 00:38:55.960]   Right here in this passage, he's putting the prophets on par with the apostles.
[00:38:55.960 --> 00:39:00.760]   He didn't say, "Trust the holy prophets and everyone who has the Holy Spirit that comes
[00:39:00.760 --> 00:39:01.760]   after me."
[00:39:01.760 --> 00:39:03.620]   He doesn't say that, okay?
[00:39:03.620 --> 00:39:08.920]   There's a select group here, a select office here, the holy prophets, which you and I are
[00:39:08.920 --> 00:39:10.440]   not a part of, okay?
[00:39:10.440 --> 00:39:12.760]   That office is done, right?
[00:39:12.760 --> 00:39:15.200]   I'm talking about the Old Testament prophets, okay?
[00:39:15.200 --> 00:39:18.200]   There are no more Old Testament prophets because the Old Testament is done.
[00:39:18.200 --> 00:39:20.040]   That is static, right?
[00:39:20.040 --> 00:39:23.600]   There's Old Testament prophets and they are done, okay?
[00:39:23.600 --> 00:39:27.900]   In the same way, and then he also says apostles.
[00:39:27.900 --> 00:39:29.160]   Apostles are also done.
[00:39:29.160 --> 00:39:32.020]   There is no such thing as I'm an apostle of Christ.
[00:39:32.020 --> 00:39:36.160]   They were a select group of men.
[00:39:36.160 --> 00:39:41.420]   Remember your word through the prophets and through the apostles, okay?
[00:39:41.420 --> 00:39:44.440]   That's why apostolic origins is so important, okay?
[00:39:44.440 --> 00:39:47.760]   The writer of Hebrews likens the Old Testament with the message of the apostles.
[00:39:47.760 --> 00:39:53.440]   In Hebrews 2, 2-3, he talks about the Old Testament and then he talks about the New
[00:39:53.440 --> 00:39:57.600]   Testament being on equal footing.
[00:39:57.600 --> 00:40:01.280]   The apostles say that the message they are conveying is really just a message of Jesus
[00:40:01.280 --> 00:40:04.840]   that is stated in the form of a tradition.
[00:40:04.840 --> 00:40:08.680]   When you and I say the word tradition, you and I mean like I have a tradition.
[00:40:08.680 --> 00:40:13.400]   I go to Krispy Kreme after my finals every single quarter, right?
[00:40:13.400 --> 00:40:14.940]   It's not something that's like sacred.
[00:40:14.940 --> 00:40:16.440]   It's just something that you do.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:19.800]   And then if you don't do it, it's not a big deal, right?
[00:40:19.800 --> 00:40:24.160]   When the apostles refer to something like with respect to a tradition, what they're
[00:40:24.160 --> 00:40:28.840]   saying is I received it from Christ and now I'm giving it to you.
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:31.880]   It's not flippant like going to Krispy Kreme, okay?
[00:40:31.880 --> 00:40:36.600]   This is I got the words of Jesus and now I'm giving it to you.
[00:40:36.600 --> 00:40:42.000]   First Corinthians 11-23, "For I received from the Lord that which I also delivered to you,
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:44.080]   that the Lord Jesus in the night in which he was betrayed took bread."
[00:40:44.080 --> 00:40:46.000]   What is he saying here, right?
[00:40:46.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   I received this from Jesus.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.280]   Who wrote First Corinthians 11?
[00:40:51.280 --> 00:40:54.640]   Yeah, he wasn't there.
[00:40:54.640 --> 00:40:56.160]   Apostle Paul wasn't there.
[00:40:56.160 --> 00:40:59.000]   He got saved later.
[00:40:59.000 --> 00:41:01.500]   But he received this from the Lord.
[00:41:01.500 --> 00:41:05.640]   He received this directly from the Lord and now I'm giving it to you.
[00:41:05.640 --> 00:41:09.840]   Second Thessalonians 3-6, "Now we command you, brethren, in the name of our Lord Jesus
[00:41:09.840 --> 00:41:14.040]   Christ, that you keep away from every brother who leads an unruly life and not according
[00:41:14.040 --> 00:41:16.680]   to the tradition which you received from us."
[00:41:16.680 --> 00:41:20.960]   Keep away from everyone who doesn't abide by the tradition that you received from us.
[00:41:20.960 --> 00:41:25.600]   He's not saying keep away from everyone who doesn't go to Krispy Kreme with us after finals,
[00:41:25.600 --> 00:41:26.600]   right?
[00:41:26.600 --> 00:41:29.720]   What he's saying is keep away from everyone from the tradition you received because that
[00:41:29.720 --> 00:41:34.160]   tradition is the word of God.
[00:41:34.160 --> 00:41:39.400]   That tradition that I'm giving to you, I received it from the Lord Jesus, okay?
[00:41:39.400 --> 00:41:44.120]   Second Corinthians 15, "I deliver it to you as a first importance which I also received."
[00:41:44.120 --> 00:41:49.360]   I delivered it to you and I just received it, right?
[00:41:49.360 --> 00:41:51.560]   The apostles had this kind of office.
[00:41:51.560 --> 00:41:54.440]   We don't, okay?
[00:41:54.440 --> 00:41:59.040]   Luke 1-2, "Just as they were handed down to us by those who from the beginning were eyewitnesses
[00:41:59.040 --> 00:42:01.040]   and servants of the word."
[00:42:01.040 --> 00:42:05.920]   You see this very large importance and I'm understating that, right, when he says large
[00:42:05.920 --> 00:42:08.480]   importance.
[00:42:08.480 --> 00:42:15.400]   This heavy responsibility that the apostles were privileged with having with respect to
[00:42:15.400 --> 00:42:16.400]   the word of God.
[00:42:16.400 --> 00:42:24.280]   They were receiving direct revelation from Christ and they were giving it to us, okay?
[00:42:24.280 --> 00:42:26.360]   Jesus said that that would happen, alright?
[00:42:26.360 --> 00:42:28.480]   Let me keep going, okay?
[00:42:28.480 --> 00:42:33.240]   "The church was built on the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Christ Jesus himself
[00:42:33.240 --> 00:42:34.240]   being the cornerstone."
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:35.240]   Right?
[00:42:35.240 --> 00:42:36.800]   That's Ephesians 2-20.
[00:42:36.800 --> 00:42:41.200]   "Therefore, the apostles were to safeguard and vault the faith that was once for all
[00:42:41.200 --> 00:42:42.720]   delivered to the saints."
[00:42:42.720 --> 00:42:43.720]   Jude 3.
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:46.600]   Jude only has one chapter, so verse 3, right?
[00:42:46.600 --> 00:42:53.760]   In Jude verse 3, chapter 1 verse 3, Jude says, "The faith that was once for all delivered
[00:42:53.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   to the saints."
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:58.680]   Jude didn't say, "The faith that is ongoing and we're going to keep writing scripture."
[00:42:58.680 --> 00:43:00.120]   No, no, no, no.
[00:43:00.120 --> 00:43:04.320]   The faith, it was once for all delivered to the saints.
[00:43:04.320 --> 00:43:08.280]   So this faith, it's done, okay?
[00:43:08.280 --> 00:43:10.640]   This is the faith, okay?
[00:43:10.640 --> 00:43:16.000]   Everyone else that comes after us preserves the faith that we have.
[00:43:16.000 --> 00:43:19.160]   You don't write like, "Oh, I got a revelation from God.
[00:43:19.160 --> 00:43:21.200]   You know, my name is Joseph Smith and I saw God."
[00:43:21.200 --> 00:43:23.880]   No, no, no, no, no, okay?
[00:43:23.880 --> 00:43:28.080]   It is once for all delivered to the saints.
[00:43:28.080 --> 00:43:31.200]   There is no Mohammed, there is no Buddha, there is no one else.
[00:43:31.200 --> 00:43:33.560]   There is no guru, there is no one else.
[00:43:33.560 --> 00:43:36.880]   This faith is once for all delivered to the saints.
[00:43:36.880 --> 00:43:46.720]   The saints that come afterwards safeguard, they vault, they preserve, they get it right.
[00:43:46.720 --> 00:43:50.920]   So given that the apostles were cognizant of writing the Old Testament, writing the
[00:43:50.920 --> 00:43:53.360]   New Testament, they made corollary claims.
[00:43:53.360 --> 00:43:55.600]   What am I saying here?
[00:43:55.600 --> 00:43:57.880]   The apostles knew that they were writing the New Testament.
[00:43:57.880 --> 00:44:01.120]   It wasn't like, you know, they were like walking, right?
[00:44:01.120 --> 00:44:03.240]   And then Peter goes, "I need to use the bathroom."
[00:44:03.240 --> 00:44:04.840]   And then Paul goes, "That's scripture."
[00:44:04.840 --> 00:44:08.040]   "Oh, did I just speak scripture?"
[00:44:08.040 --> 00:44:09.960]   That's not how it happened, okay?
[00:44:09.960 --> 00:44:14.000]   They knew that they were speaking scripture.
[00:44:14.000 --> 00:44:15.000]   How do I know this?
[00:44:15.000 --> 00:44:20.680]   Okay, 1 Timothy 5.18, "For the scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle the ox while it is threshing,
[00:44:20.680 --> 00:44:23.040]   and the laborer is worthy of his wages.'"
[00:44:23.040 --> 00:44:27.880]   That first portion, "You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing," comes in Deuteronomy.
[00:44:27.880 --> 00:44:34.760]   "The laborer is worthy of his wages," comes from Luke 10.7.
[00:44:34.760 --> 00:44:41.080]   So in 1 Timothy 5.18, he's quoting Luke 10.7.
[00:44:41.080 --> 00:44:46.360]   They already know from this point early on what is scripture, okay?
[00:44:46.360 --> 00:44:52.000]   Second Peter 3.16, "As also in all his letters, speaking in them of things in which are some
[00:44:52.000 --> 00:44:58.320]   things hard to understand, which the untaught and unstable distort, as they do also the
[00:44:58.320 --> 00:45:01.840]   rest of scriptures to their own destruction."
[00:45:01.840 --> 00:45:05.400]   You see what he did there, Peter?
[00:45:05.400 --> 00:45:07.000]   He just said Paul's letters are scripture.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:08.000]   You see that?
[00:45:08.000 --> 00:45:13.480]   "As they do also the rest of the scriptures."
[00:45:13.480 --> 00:45:15.520]   So they distort all of that.
[00:45:15.520 --> 00:45:17.080]   They distort God's Word, right?
[00:45:17.080 --> 00:45:21.960]   They're just distorting Paul's letters, just like they do the rest of scriptures.
[00:45:21.960 --> 00:45:25.800]   So he's just nonchalantly.
[00:45:25.800 --> 00:45:29.240]   For them at the time, they understood.
[00:45:29.240 --> 00:45:31.280]   For the most part, they understood.
[00:45:31.280 --> 00:45:35.880]   So it's not like he needs to say, "Oh, this is scripture?"
[00:45:35.880 --> 00:45:37.440]   Not at the time, okay?
[00:45:37.440 --> 00:45:41.680]   So because there was an understanding, at least just generally speaking, he's saying
[00:45:41.680 --> 00:45:45.720]   this kind of almost offhand, "As they do the rest of scriptures."
[00:45:45.720 --> 00:45:50.000]   John 21.24, "This is the disciple who was testifying to these things and wrote these
[00:45:50.000 --> 00:45:55.240]   things, and we know that his testimony is true."
[00:45:55.240 --> 00:46:01.880]   He's testifying to these things, and he wrote these things, and we know that his testimony
[00:46:01.880 --> 00:46:02.880]   is true.
[00:46:02.880 --> 00:46:06.840]   1 Thessalonians 2.13, "For this reason, we also constantly thank God that when you received
[00:46:06.840 --> 00:46:11.800]   the Word of God which you heard from us, you accepted it not as the Word of men, but for
[00:46:11.800 --> 00:46:19.280]   what it really is, the Word of God, which also performs its work in you who believe.
[00:46:19.280 --> 00:46:24.520]   I am glad that when you heard what I told you, you didn't accept it as the Word of men,
[00:46:24.520 --> 00:46:29.640]   but for what it really is, the Word of God."
[00:46:29.640 --> 00:46:34.440]   They were cognizant when they were writing the New Testament that this is God's Word.
[00:46:34.440 --> 00:46:38.320]   Or else how would they know what is God's Word and what is not?
[00:46:38.320 --> 00:46:41.600]   Because again, like I told you before, it's not like they were just walking around and
[00:46:41.600 --> 00:46:45.640]   everything that's like, everything Apostle Paul said is God's Word, right?
[00:46:45.640 --> 00:46:50.400]   That is not true, right?
[00:46:50.400 --> 00:46:54.400]   2 Thessalonians 2.15, "So then, brethren, stand firm and hold to the traditions which
[00:46:54.400 --> 00:47:00.440]   you were taught, whether by word of mouth or by letter from us."
[00:47:00.440 --> 00:47:02.720]   Stand firm and hold to the traditions.
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:07.840]   Again, when he says traditions, I just showed you a whole bunch of verses, right?
[00:47:07.840 --> 00:47:10.480]   Which I received from the Lord Jesus, right?
[00:47:10.480 --> 00:47:14.440]   Not a tradition like, again, like you and me, every year we do this, every quarter we
[00:47:14.440 --> 00:47:15.440]   do this.
[00:47:15.440 --> 00:47:22.040]   But a tradition in this context is what did they receive from the Lord Jesus.
[00:47:22.040 --> 00:47:26.880]   So hold on to the traditions because it is the Word of God.
[00:47:26.880 --> 00:47:31.720]   1 Corinthians 14, "If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize
[00:47:31.720 --> 00:47:34.000]   the things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment.
[00:47:34.000 --> 00:47:38.560]   But if anyone does not recognize this, he is not recognized."
[00:47:38.560 --> 00:47:44.200]   So if you think you're godly, then you should recognize that what I'm saying to you is from
[00:47:44.200 --> 00:47:45.800]   God.
[00:47:45.800 --> 00:47:47.200]   He's saying that right here.
[00:47:47.200 --> 00:47:50.840]   Paul's saying that right here in 1 Corinthians 14, right?
[00:47:50.840 --> 00:47:56.080]   2 Corinthians 12, "Because of the surpassing greatness of the revelations for this reason,
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:59.200]   to keep me from exalting myself, there was given me a thorn in the flesh, a messenger
[00:47:59.200 --> 00:48:02.400]   of Satan to torment me, to keep me from exalting myself.
[00:48:02.400 --> 00:48:05.080]   Concerning this, I implored the Lord three times that I might leave me.
[00:48:05.080 --> 00:48:11.760]   And he has said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.'"
[00:48:11.760 --> 00:48:18.440]   Very specifically, Paul's saying here, "And he said to me, God said to me, 'My grace is
[00:48:18.440 --> 00:48:22.000]   sufficient for you, for power is perfected in weakness.'"
[00:48:22.000 --> 00:48:27.060]   He knew what Scripture was.
[00:48:27.060 --> 00:48:30.960]   And all these thoughts are building upon that, okay?
[00:48:30.960 --> 00:48:35.320]   1 John 1-5, "What was from the beginning?
[00:48:35.320 --> 00:48:38.840]   What we heard, what we have seen with our eyes, what we looked at and touched with our
[00:48:38.840 --> 00:48:42.800]   hands, concerning the word of life, and the life was manifested, and we have seen and
[00:48:42.800 --> 00:48:46.480]   testify and proclaim to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested
[00:48:46.480 --> 00:48:47.480]   to us.
[00:48:47.480 --> 00:48:50.480]   What we have seen and heard, we proclaim to you also, so that you too may have fellowship
[00:48:50.480 --> 00:48:51.480]   with us.
[00:48:51.480 --> 00:48:54.880]   And indeed, our fellowship is with the Father and with his Son, Jesus Christ."
[00:48:54.880 --> 00:49:05.480]   These things, these things, we, apostles, we write.
[00:49:05.480 --> 00:49:10.040]   They were very cognizant that they were writing the new covenant.
[00:49:10.040 --> 00:49:13.540]   Paul said, "We are the ministers of the new covenant."
[00:49:13.540 --> 00:49:17.340]   Paul said, "You accepted it not as the word of man, but as the word of God."
[00:49:17.340 --> 00:49:21.160]   Paul said, "You should recognize it that it's the word of God."
[00:49:21.160 --> 00:49:24.760]   Paul said, "This is the tradition which I got from the Lord Jesus."
[00:49:24.760 --> 00:49:29.240]   Paul said, "The Lord said to me, 'My grace is sufficient for you.'"
[00:49:29.240 --> 00:49:34.960]   The apostolic office was special and different from us.
[00:49:34.960 --> 00:49:42.320]   We're actually receiving words from God and preserving it, vaulting it, putting it in
[00:49:42.320 --> 00:49:46.560]   a safe.
[00:49:46.560 --> 00:49:47.560]   Revelation 1, 1-3.
[00:49:47.560 --> 00:49:55.120]   "The revelation of Jesus Christ, which God gave him to show to his bondservants."
[00:49:55.120 --> 00:50:00.120]   God gave him to show to his bondservants.
[00:50:00.120 --> 00:50:02.520]   Who are his bondservants?
[00:50:02.520 --> 00:50:06.120]   You know his bondservants are.
[00:50:06.120 --> 00:50:10.400]   God gave him to show to his bondservants.
[00:50:10.400 --> 00:50:14.400]   God showed his bondservants.
[00:50:14.400 --> 00:50:17.960]   God didn't show it to you and me, not in this way.
[00:50:17.960 --> 00:50:19.120]   You and I are reading about it.
[00:50:19.120 --> 00:50:21.840]   You and I are obeying it, okay?
[00:50:21.840 --> 00:50:24.400]   But you and I are not apostles.
[00:50:24.400 --> 00:50:25.720]   We come after the fact.
[00:50:25.720 --> 00:50:26.720]   We preserve it.
[00:50:26.720 --> 00:50:27.720]   We fight for it.
[00:50:27.720 --> 00:50:29.600]   But we are not apostles.
[00:50:29.600 --> 00:50:35.560]   Verse 3, "Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy."
[00:50:35.560 --> 00:50:39.640]   How are you going to read something unless it's written down?
[00:50:39.640 --> 00:50:42.200]   How are you going to read something unless it's written down?
[00:50:42.200 --> 00:50:43.920]   Exodus 4, 11-12, okay?
[00:50:43.920 --> 00:50:49.040]   "The Lord said to him, 'Who has made man's mouth?
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:51.760]   Or who makes them mute or deaf or seeing or blind?
[00:50:51.760 --> 00:50:53.720]   Is it not I, the Lord?
[00:50:53.720 --> 00:51:02.400]   Now then go and even I will be with your mouth.'"
[00:51:02.400 --> 00:51:11.920]   If God created the world, he created space, he created time, he can move mouths to make
[00:51:11.920 --> 00:51:14.200]   the New Testament.
[00:51:14.200 --> 00:51:16.120]   This is not going to be hard for him.
[00:51:16.120 --> 00:51:17.120]   Right?
[00:51:17.120 --> 00:51:19.640]   Oh, how do we make sure that we got it right?
[00:51:19.640 --> 00:51:23.360]   If God wants to get it right, he will get it right, okay?
[00:51:23.360 --> 00:51:29.240]   Deuteronomy 18-18, 18 verse 18, "I will raise up a prophet from among their countrymen like
[00:51:29.240 --> 00:51:37.120]   you, and I will put my words in his mouth, and he shall speak to them all that I command
[00:51:37.120 --> 00:51:39.960]   him."
[00:51:39.960 --> 00:51:43.320]   This is a prophecy of Christ.
[00:51:43.320 --> 00:51:44.320]   This is a prophecy of Christ.
[00:51:44.320 --> 00:51:47.480]   If you've never studied Deuteronomy 18, this is referring to Christ.
[00:51:47.480 --> 00:51:50.960]   "I'm going to raise up a prophet from among you.
[00:51:50.960 --> 00:51:54.720]   I'm going to put my words in his mouth."
[00:51:54.720 --> 00:51:56.160]   Okay?
[00:51:56.160 --> 00:52:02.680]   John 14, "These things I have spoken to you while abiding with you, but the Helper, the
[00:52:02.680 --> 00:52:12.320]   Holy Spirit, whom the Father will send in my name, he will teach you all things and
[00:52:12.320 --> 00:52:19.960]   bring to your remembrance all that I said to you."
[00:52:19.960 --> 00:52:23.000]   John 14, who is Jesus speaking to?
[00:52:23.000 --> 00:52:24.960]   That's right.
[00:52:24.960 --> 00:52:27.120]   What is he saying here?
[00:52:27.120 --> 00:52:30.360]   You guys are filled with sin, so you might get this wrong.
[00:52:30.360 --> 00:52:34.280]   You guys are unfaithful, so you might get this wrong.
[00:52:34.280 --> 00:52:41.280]   Apostolic origins is important not because of the greatness of the apostles, but because
[00:52:41.280 --> 00:52:43.760]   of what Jesus said.
[00:52:43.760 --> 00:52:50.840]   He is telling them, "The Holy Spirit is going to teach you all things and bring to your
[00:52:50.840 --> 00:52:52.840]   remembrance all that I said to you."
[00:52:52.840 --> 00:52:58.200]   Now, I know when we read John 14, we think of it as individually, personally.
[00:52:58.200 --> 00:52:59.280]   That's how we interpret it.
[00:52:59.280 --> 00:53:03.880]   We read this passage and we think, "God is going to allow me to understand all things."
[00:53:03.880 --> 00:53:04.880]   Right?
[00:53:04.880 --> 00:53:09.800]   But he didn't promise you that you're going to take an exam and you're going to remember
[00:53:09.800 --> 00:53:10.800]   everything that you studied.
[00:53:10.800 --> 00:53:12.680]   He didn't make that promise to you.
[00:53:12.680 --> 00:53:15.440]   He didn't promise you that you're going to read scripture and that you're going to remember
[00:53:15.440 --> 00:53:17.760]   everything that you read that morning.
[00:53:17.760 --> 00:53:21.280]   You do your devos and then in the afternoon you totally forgot.
[00:53:21.280 --> 00:53:22.400]   How do I know?
[00:53:22.400 --> 00:53:26.400]   You probably read something about anger and then you're ticked off in the afternoon.
[00:53:26.400 --> 00:53:27.520]   Right?
[00:53:27.520 --> 00:53:35.480]   John 14 is primarily not speaking about an individual relationship with God.
[00:53:35.480 --> 00:53:39.480]   Now, I'm not saying that principle isn't there.
[00:53:39.480 --> 00:53:41.880]   Because the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit.
[00:53:41.880 --> 00:53:43.040]   Okay?
[00:53:43.040 --> 00:53:52.240]   But firstly, Jesus is talking to his men and he's saying to them, "He's going to teach
[00:53:52.240 --> 00:53:58.280]   you all things and bring to your remembrance all that I said to you."
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.760]   The things that you forgot that are important, Holy Spirit is going to remind you of those
[00:54:02.760 --> 00:54:03.760]   things.
[00:54:03.760 --> 00:54:08.120]   In fact, there are things that you don't know, Holy Spirit is going to teach you.
[00:54:08.120 --> 00:54:12.200]   John 16, "I have many more things to say to you but you cannot bear them now."
[00:54:12.200 --> 00:54:16.200]   I want to tell you like, you know, the qualities of an elder, the qualities of a deacon, how
[00:54:16.200 --> 00:54:20.560]   to run a church, but you can't bear them now because you're stressing out.
[00:54:20.560 --> 00:54:28.640]   But when he, the Spirit of Truth comes, he will guide you into all the truth.
[00:54:28.640 --> 00:54:32.960]   Oh, this is a promise.
[00:54:32.960 --> 00:54:34.600]   This is a promise here.
[00:54:34.600 --> 00:54:39.160]   He's going to guide you into all the truth, for he will not speak on his own initiative,
[00:54:39.160 --> 00:54:45.000]   but whatever he hears, he will speak and he will disclose to you what is to come.
[00:54:45.000 --> 00:54:48.000]   He will glorify me for he will take of mine and will disclose it to you.
[00:54:48.000 --> 00:54:52.920]   All things that the Father has are mine, therefore I said that he takes of mine and will disclose
[00:54:52.920 --> 00:54:55.200]   it to you.
[00:54:55.200 --> 00:55:01.480]   Everything that the Holy Spirit teaches to you will be from me.
[00:55:01.480 --> 00:55:02.840]   That's what Christ is saying.
[00:55:02.840 --> 00:55:03.840]   Right?
[00:55:03.840 --> 00:55:05.440]   That's what he's saying here.
[00:55:05.440 --> 00:55:06.440]   Okay?
[00:55:06.440 --> 00:55:11.160]   He will guide you into all the truth.
[00:55:11.160 --> 00:55:16.160]   Whatever he hears, he will speak and he will disclose it to you.
[00:55:16.160 --> 00:55:17.820]   This is a promise here.
[00:55:17.820 --> 00:55:20.120]   This is a promise here to his men.
[00:55:20.120 --> 00:55:24.200]   So you see why apostolic origins is so important here.
[00:55:24.200 --> 00:55:25.200]   Right?
[00:55:25.200 --> 00:55:30.520]   This is not a promise to every believer through the history of time that they're going to
[00:55:30.520 --> 00:55:32.880]   write a New Testament.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:34.600]   No.
[00:55:34.600 --> 00:55:39.520]   What he's saying here is he's saying to his men that the Holy Spirit is going to disclose
[00:55:39.520 --> 00:55:41.520]   to you.
[00:55:41.520 --> 00:55:43.200]   He's going to tell you.
[00:55:43.200 --> 00:55:45.680]   He's going to show you.
[00:55:45.680 --> 00:55:50.280]   I want to tell you these things right now, but you can't handle it.
[00:55:50.280 --> 00:55:55.240]   But when the Holy Spirit comes, you'll be able to handle it.
[00:55:55.240 --> 00:55:58.400]   Remember, Jesus was about to die.
[00:55:58.400 --> 00:55:59.400]   He's going away.
[00:55:59.400 --> 00:56:00.400]   Right?
[00:56:00.400 --> 00:56:02.480]   And all they knew for the last three years was Christ.
[00:56:02.480 --> 00:56:03.480]   That's all they knew.
[00:56:03.480 --> 00:56:05.760]   The last three years, all they knew was Christ.
[00:56:05.760 --> 00:56:10.240]   And as long as they're with Christ, they're victorious.
[00:56:10.240 --> 00:56:11.480]   How are we going to feed these people?
[00:56:11.480 --> 00:56:12.480]   Bam.
[00:56:12.480 --> 00:56:13.480]   How are we going to feed these people?
[00:56:13.480 --> 00:56:14.480]   Bam.
[00:56:14.480 --> 00:56:15.480]   Right?
[00:56:15.480 --> 00:56:16.480]   We're about to drown.
[00:56:16.480 --> 00:56:17.480]   Bam.
[00:56:17.480 --> 00:56:18.480]   Right?
[00:56:18.480 --> 00:56:20.920]   As long as they're with Christ, things are good.
[00:56:20.920 --> 00:56:23.800]   But Christ is going away.
[00:56:23.800 --> 00:56:27.520]   So they are kind of stressed out.
[00:56:27.520 --> 00:56:33.040]   So Christ is saying, "I got more things I want to tell you, but you can't bear it right
[00:56:33.040 --> 00:56:34.040]   now.
[00:56:34.040 --> 00:56:35.040]   But it's okay.
[00:56:35.040 --> 00:56:40.000]   The Holy Spirit's going to come, and he's going to guide you, not into some truth, but
[00:56:40.000 --> 00:56:44.320]   into all truth."
[00:56:44.320 --> 00:56:47.760]   So what about the books that were not penned directly by the apostles?
[00:56:47.760 --> 00:56:51.120]   Well, Luke was a close traveling companion of Paul through Acts.
[00:56:51.120 --> 00:56:52.120]   Okay?
[00:56:52.120 --> 00:56:53.400]   And verses are right there.
[00:56:53.400 --> 00:56:57.480]   Mark is mentioned as a son of Peter in 1 Peter 5.13.
[00:56:57.480 --> 00:57:00.680]   James was recognized nearly from the beginning as a leader.
[00:57:00.680 --> 00:57:02.960]   Judah was a brother of James and Jesus.
[00:57:02.960 --> 00:57:05.920]   And Hebrews was actually recognized to have Pauline authorship early on.
[00:57:05.920 --> 00:57:09.960]   I know we debate about that, but at least early on, it was recognized to have Pauline
[00:57:09.960 --> 00:57:10.960]   authorship.
[00:57:10.960 --> 00:57:11.960]   Okay?
[00:57:11.960 --> 00:57:17.760]   So every single book in the New Testament is either penned directly by an apostle or
[00:57:17.760 --> 00:57:20.640]   with someone with close association to an apostle.
[00:57:20.640 --> 00:57:25.080]   You can consider it apostolic literature because of the closeness of their relationship.
[00:57:25.080 --> 00:57:29.160]   That apostle was directly involved.
[00:57:29.160 --> 00:57:32.000]   Okay?
[00:57:32.000 --> 00:57:34.080]   Corporate reception.
[00:57:34.080 --> 00:57:36.080]   Corporate reception.
[00:57:36.080 --> 00:57:37.760]   Okay.
[00:57:37.760 --> 00:57:45.120]   Divine qualities, apostolic origins, and corporate reception.
[00:57:45.120 --> 00:57:50.400]   These have been, so far, our criteria for the canon of Scripture.
[00:57:50.400 --> 00:57:51.480]   Okay?
[00:57:51.480 --> 00:57:55.040]   They are self-authenticating.
[00:57:55.040 --> 00:58:01.360]   They are self-authenticating because God's Word has to be self-authenticating.
[00:58:01.360 --> 00:58:07.080]   The reason God's Word has to be self-authenticating is because there is nothing greater than God's
[00:58:07.080 --> 00:58:08.560]   Word.
[00:58:08.560 --> 00:58:10.560]   There's nothing greater than God's Word.
[00:58:10.560 --> 00:58:19.000]   So if you're going to authenticate God's Word, it's going to come in the fashion of an attribute.
[00:58:19.000 --> 00:58:20.120]   Okay?
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:26.160]   So when I say the criteria of the canon, criteria for the canon of Scripture, a better word
[00:58:26.160 --> 00:58:29.960]   is actually attributes of a canon of Scripture.
[00:58:29.960 --> 00:58:33.680]   The canon of Scripture exhibits these three qualities.
[00:58:33.680 --> 00:58:35.080]   Okay?
[00:58:35.080 --> 00:58:36.080]   These three factors here.
[00:58:36.080 --> 00:58:37.680]   I'm going to use the word criteria.
[00:58:37.680 --> 00:58:38.680]   That's fine.
[00:58:38.680 --> 00:58:47.560]   But I'm trying to press upon you, okay, why it has to be self-authenticating, why being
[00:58:47.560 --> 00:58:52.520]   self-authenticating is remarkably impressive, right?
[00:58:52.520 --> 00:58:55.920]   And with respect to anything, not just God's Word.
[00:58:55.920 --> 00:58:58.280]   Remember, let me say it again.
[00:58:58.280 --> 00:59:00.980]   Anything that is fundamental.
[00:59:00.980 --> 00:59:02.880]   Anything that is foundational.
[00:59:02.880 --> 00:59:05.960]   We're not giving like a separate, "Oh, God's Word gets special treatment."
[00:59:05.960 --> 00:59:07.760]   We're not doing that, okay?
[00:59:07.760 --> 00:59:14.160]   Anything that is fundamental and anything that is foundational is going to be self-authenticating.
[00:59:14.160 --> 00:59:17.400]   And I just used the example of sensory perception to you, right?
[00:59:17.400 --> 00:59:20.040]   I used the example of the laws of logic, okay?
[00:59:20.040 --> 00:59:22.940]   I hope you guys are following me here.
[00:59:22.940 --> 00:59:24.960]   Point number three.
[00:59:24.960 --> 00:59:26.840]   Point number three.
[00:59:26.840 --> 00:59:29.080]   Corporate reception.
[00:59:29.080 --> 00:59:38.040]   If God's Word has divine qualities, if it has apostolic origins, then it's going to
[00:59:38.040 --> 00:59:40.400]   be received as God's Word.
[00:59:40.400 --> 00:59:43.200]   Why is it going to be received as God's Word?
[00:59:43.200 --> 00:59:44.200]   Why?
[00:59:44.200 --> 00:59:46.660]   Because the Holy Spirit dwells in you.
[00:59:46.660 --> 00:59:52.840]   If the Holy Spirit dwells in you, it's not so much you recognizing that it's Scripture,
[00:59:52.840 --> 01:00:00.000]   it's the Holy Spirit within you hearing Scripture and recognizing it, okay?
[01:00:00.000 --> 01:00:02.000]   You know what that's akin to?
[01:00:02.000 --> 01:00:04.160]   Sanctification, right?
[01:00:04.160 --> 01:00:05.160]   You're justified.
[01:00:05.160 --> 01:00:06.160]   Did you do that?
[01:00:06.160 --> 01:00:07.160]   No.
[01:00:07.160 --> 01:00:09.200]   God did that, right?
[01:00:09.200 --> 01:00:13.720]   And then you embark on the road of sanctification.
[01:00:13.720 --> 01:00:14.720]   But is it really you?
[01:00:14.720 --> 01:00:17.000]   Well, it's the Holy Spirit within you, right?
[01:00:17.000 --> 01:00:18.840]   Now, don't get me wrong.
[01:00:18.840 --> 01:00:22.040]   You are accountable for your sins, right?
[01:00:22.040 --> 01:00:26.560]   But outside the power of the Holy Spirit, you would succumb to your flesh.
[01:00:26.560 --> 01:00:31.680]   So it's similar in that sense where God is working all aspects.
[01:00:31.680 --> 01:00:34.440]   Every single aspect, He's working it by Himself, okay?
[01:00:34.440 --> 01:00:37.640]   So New Testament characterization, okay?
[01:00:37.640 --> 01:00:41.440]   And regard the patience of our Lord, 2 Peter 3.15 to 16, right?
[01:00:41.440 --> 01:00:42.800]   So I'm quoting this verse again.
[01:00:42.800 --> 01:00:45.680]   I quoted it earlier, right?
[01:00:45.680 --> 01:00:48.700]   But look at it within the lens of corporate reception.
[01:00:48.700 --> 01:00:55.720]   And Peter says here, "As they do also the rest of the Scriptures," right?
[01:00:55.720 --> 01:01:02.560]   There's the angle in which it is apostolic origins because he's likening Paul, right,
[01:01:02.560 --> 01:01:04.880]   what he's writing to the rest of Scriptures.
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:06.820]   So there is that angle to it.
[01:01:06.820 --> 01:01:15.080]   But the other angle to it is that Peter's audience understands that this is Scripture.
[01:01:15.080 --> 01:01:16.360]   He understands it.
[01:01:16.360 --> 01:01:17.640]   He's not making a defense for it.
[01:01:17.640 --> 01:01:21.440]   Like, by the way, Paul's letters are Scripture for these reasons.
[01:01:21.440 --> 01:01:23.200]   He's not doing that.
[01:01:23.200 --> 01:01:27.800]   He's just kind of saying it casually, like an offhand comment, right?
[01:01:27.800 --> 01:01:30.280]   He's just saying, "As they do the rest of Scriptures."
[01:01:30.280 --> 01:01:35.720]   That only works if they already received it as Scriptures.
[01:01:35.720 --> 01:01:39.580]   That only works if they already received it as Scriptures, right?
[01:01:39.580 --> 01:01:44.160]   If I were to say to you, right, if I were to say it to you, right, yeah, like, you know,
[01:01:44.160 --> 01:01:48.520]   it's like, you know, like, you know, blah, blah, like, you know, blah, blah, is the goat
[01:01:48.520 --> 01:01:51.440]   of Tom Brady.
[01:01:51.440 --> 01:01:52.440]   Just use Tom Brady, okay?
[01:01:52.440 --> 01:01:54.320]   Tom Brady is the goat, right?
[01:01:54.320 --> 01:01:57.320]   He's the goat of football.
[01:01:57.320 --> 01:01:58.400]   He's just the goat.
[01:01:58.400 --> 01:02:01.100]   He's like the Michael Jordan of football.
[01:02:01.100 --> 01:02:07.060]   If I were to say that to you and no one, like, pushes back, it's because we all agree that
[01:02:07.060 --> 01:02:09.520]   Michael Jordan is the goat.
[01:02:09.520 --> 01:02:15.160]   In the same way, greatest of all time, in the same way, when he says, "The rest of the
[01:02:15.160 --> 01:02:18.760]   Scriptures," there's no defense here.
[01:02:18.760 --> 01:02:22.080]   He's not saying, "And let me give you a reason why, like, Paul's letters are--" He's not
[01:02:22.080 --> 01:02:24.040]   doing that, right?
[01:02:24.040 --> 01:02:29.160]   And the reason he doesn't have to do that is because they already accepted it as Scripture.
[01:02:29.160 --> 01:02:34.480]   So you know that the audience, from this very early point on, they've already received it
[01:02:34.480 --> 01:02:36.080]   as Scripture, okay?
[01:02:36.080 --> 01:02:40.120]   Peter claims apostolic authority and calls Paul his brother, right?
[01:02:40.120 --> 01:02:43.920]   This will lend itself to the idea that Peter is also writing Scripture.
[01:02:43.920 --> 01:02:48.120]   First Timothy 5.18, I know I'm quoting the same verses again, or at least some of the
[01:02:48.120 --> 01:02:53.240]   same verses, but I want you to see it in a different angle, okay?
[01:02:53.240 --> 01:02:57.820]   If he's just quoting Scripture, he says, "For the Scripture says," right?
[01:02:57.820 --> 01:02:58.920]   And there's no pushback here.
[01:02:58.920 --> 01:03:02.580]   "For the Scripture says, 'You shall not muzzle the ox while he is threshing.
[01:03:02.580 --> 01:03:04.520]   The labor is worthy of his wages.'"
[01:03:04.520 --> 01:03:09.800]   The audience must have understood this as Scripture because he's not giving a defense
[01:03:09.800 --> 01:03:10.880]   for it.
[01:03:10.880 --> 01:03:17.300]   What that means is that from the earliest point on, from the very earliest point on,
[01:03:17.300 --> 01:03:19.920]   they understood this as God's Word.
[01:03:19.920 --> 01:03:22.520]   They understood it as Scripture.
[01:03:22.520 --> 01:03:29.400]   Second Peter 3.2, prophets and apostles are juxtaposed, right?
[01:03:29.400 --> 01:03:30.400]   There's no defense here.
[01:03:30.400 --> 01:03:33.160]   "Yeah, you know, you should listen to us because Jesus said so."
[01:03:33.160 --> 01:03:35.640]   He doesn't go on this defense here, right?
[01:03:35.640 --> 01:03:41.660]   He just says, "Listen to the holy prophets and listen to us," right?
[01:03:41.660 --> 01:03:47.240]   So then we know that the audience must have understood that and received that because
[01:03:47.240 --> 01:03:49.540]   he doesn't go on a defense here.
[01:03:49.540 --> 01:03:51.320]   He doesn't do that here.
[01:03:51.320 --> 01:03:54.720]   First Corinthians 14, "If anyone thinks he is a prophet or spiritual, let him recognize
[01:03:54.720 --> 01:03:57.320]   that things which I write to you are the Lord's commandment."
[01:03:57.320 --> 01:03:58.980]   Same type of thinking.
[01:03:58.980 --> 01:04:00.640]   Same exact type of thinking.
[01:04:00.640 --> 01:04:05.680]   Hebrews 2.2-3, "For the word spoken through the angels proved unalterable and every transgression
[01:04:05.680 --> 01:04:07.560]   and disobedience received a just penalty."
[01:04:07.560 --> 01:04:10.200]   How will we escape if we neglect so great a salvation?
[01:04:10.200 --> 01:04:15.600]   "After it was at first spoken through the Lord, it was confirmed to us by those who
[01:04:15.600 --> 01:04:20.360]   heard."
[01:04:20.360 --> 01:04:24.120]   The word spoken through the angels, Old Testament.
[01:04:24.120 --> 01:04:28.400]   That's another way of saying the Old Testament, okay?
[01:04:28.400 --> 01:04:33.560]   How are we going to neglect so great a salvation after it was first spoken through the Lord,
[01:04:33.560 --> 01:04:39.840]   that's Jesus, and confirmed to us by those who heard?
[01:04:39.840 --> 01:04:43.200]   How are you going to escape this?
[01:04:43.200 --> 01:04:48.200]   Because this, what the writer of Hebrews is saying is, "This is greater."
[01:04:48.200 --> 01:04:53.280]   If those guys didn't escape judgment, how are we going to escape judgment?
[01:04:53.280 --> 01:04:54.480]   Because we heard it.
[01:04:54.480 --> 01:04:59.920]   So very early on, right, we know that they understood this as Scripture.
[01:04:59.920 --> 01:05:04.240]   First Timothy 3.15, "But in case I am delayed, I write so that you will know how one ought
[01:05:04.240 --> 01:05:05.240]   to conduct himself."
[01:05:05.240 --> 01:05:06.240]   Right?
[01:05:06.240 --> 01:05:09.040]   There's no, again, there's no defense here.
[01:05:09.040 --> 01:05:13.080]   First Peter 2.5, "You also as living stones are being built up as a spiritual house for
[01:05:13.080 --> 01:05:19.400]   holy priesthood to offer spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ."
[01:05:19.400 --> 01:05:22.040]   Think about this here.
[01:05:22.040 --> 01:05:31.560]   Corporately, you and I are being built up by the Holy Spirit.
[01:05:31.560 --> 01:05:33.640]   Okay?
[01:05:33.640 --> 01:05:39.640]   How is that going to work unless the church receives God's Word?
[01:05:39.640 --> 01:05:41.160]   It's not going to work.
[01:05:41.160 --> 01:05:44.120]   The church must receive God's Word.
[01:05:44.120 --> 01:05:49.040]   The church will receive God's Word because you and I are living stones.
[01:05:49.040 --> 01:05:54.960]   First Corinthians 12.13, "For by one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether
[01:05:54.960 --> 01:06:02.200]   Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and we were all made to drink of one Spirit."
[01:06:02.200 --> 01:06:05.480]   All of us, every single one of us, baptized by one Spirit.
[01:06:05.480 --> 01:06:10.720]   Of course, of course the church is going to receive His Word.
[01:06:10.720 --> 01:06:12.600]   Of course.
[01:06:12.600 --> 01:06:15.520]   Because we are all living stones.
[01:06:15.520 --> 01:06:21.340]   all baptized into one body. Let me give you another example of corporate
[01:06:21.340 --> 01:06:25.160]   reception, okay? New Testament public reading can be traced to the public
[01:06:25.160 --> 01:06:29.960]   reading of the Old Testament texts, okay? What do I mean by that? In the old test,
[01:06:29.960 --> 01:06:34.440]   in the synagogue, you know what they would do? They would kind of have, like,
[01:06:34.440 --> 01:06:39.540]   something like sermons. And they would read the Old Testament. They just read it.
[01:06:39.540 --> 01:06:45.680]   They would just read it. Boom, read, read, read, read, read. Oh, but then a special
[01:06:45.680 --> 01:06:52.680]   instruction came about. Oh, what was this? Have my letter read among you. That's
[01:06:52.680 --> 01:06:59.680]   interesting. This began to replace the Old Testament reading of text.
[01:06:59.680 --> 01:07:03.520]   Colossians 4 16. When this letter is read among you, have it also read in the
[01:07:03.520 --> 01:07:07.080]   Church of the Laodiceans, and you, for your part, read my letter that is coming from
[01:07:07.080 --> 01:07:12.120]   Laodicea. I urge you by the Lord to have this letter read to all the brethren.
[01:07:12.120 --> 01:07:15.600]   Blessed is he who reads and those who hear the words of the prophecy, and
[01:07:15.600 --> 01:07:21.120]   heed the things which are written, for the time is near. Until I come, give
[01:07:21.120 --> 01:07:26.920]   attention to the public reading of Scripture, to exhortation and teaching.
[01:07:26.920 --> 01:07:33.520]   That is significant because the Old Testament practice was to read God's
[01:07:33.520 --> 01:07:37.800]   Word. When you and I read this, we just think, "Hey, Paul has an update." You know
[01:07:37.800 --> 01:07:40.240]   like when the missionary comes up and he kind of gives you an update? No, it's
[01:07:40.240 --> 01:07:45.520]   not the same thing. Okay? The public reading of Scripture was reading God's
[01:07:45.520 --> 01:07:54.520]   Word. But something, ouch, something is beginning to replace the reading of Old
[01:07:54.520 --> 01:08:05.320]   Testament texts. That ain't gonna happen unless it's the New Testament. You guys
[01:08:05.320 --> 01:08:11.840]   are following me, right? When public reading of Scripture, okay, it is not like
[01:08:11.840 --> 01:08:18.320]   you and me, missionary comes up, he gives an update, blah blah blah. Okay? Public
[01:08:18.320 --> 01:08:22.280]   reading of Scripture is like, instead of Pastor Peter speaking, have someone else
[01:08:22.280 --> 01:08:27.800]   speak. You're gonna take that as a sermon. That's gonna be a sermon to you,
[01:08:27.800 --> 01:08:33.200]   right? So in here, when there was the Old Testament reading of public
[01:08:33.200 --> 01:08:40.680]   reading, it was of Scripture. But this began to take its place. So corporately,
[01:08:40.680 --> 01:08:49.520]   very early on, they received it as the Word of God. Okay? The apostolic fathers
[01:08:49.520 --> 01:08:52.920]   acknowledge apostolic authority and the authority of the New Testament. Okay,
[01:08:52.920 --> 01:08:58.120]   apostolic fathers is a very fancy way of saying the people who were in the
[01:08:58.120 --> 01:09:03.360]   Apostle small group. Okay? So whoever was in, like, that's, okay, they're disciples.
[01:09:03.360 --> 01:09:13.600]   Okay? So Apostle Peter's disciple. Apostle John's disciple. Paul's disciple. Matthew's,
[01:09:14.640 --> 01:09:20.000]   Nathanael's disciple. Like, they're disciples. Okay? Collectively as a group,
[01:09:20.000 --> 01:09:25.880]   right, were the apostolic fathers. When I say early church fathers, it's like a
[01:09:25.880 --> 01:09:30.040]   time period. There's like generations. Okay? And you can kind of cut it off at some
[01:09:30.040 --> 01:09:34.040]   point, but like, that's what I'm talking about. The early church fathers. So
[01:09:34.040 --> 01:09:38.640]   apostolic fathers go within the group of the early church fathers. But the
[01:09:38.640 --> 01:09:42.840]   apostolic fathers are the ones who learned directly from the Apostles.
[01:09:42.840 --> 01:09:48.080]   Directly. Okay? So Clement says, "Take up the epistles of the blessed Apostle Paul.
[01:09:48.080 --> 01:09:52.280]   To be sure, he sent you a letter in the spirit concerning himself and Cephas and
[01:09:52.280 --> 01:09:57.080]   Apollos. The Apostles received the gospel for us from the Lord Jesus Christ. Jesus
[01:09:57.080 --> 01:10:00.880]   Christ was sent from God. The Christ, therefore, is from God and the Apostles
[01:10:00.880 --> 01:10:08.560]   from Christ." So very early on, they were taught that the Apostles were speaking
[01:10:08.560 --> 01:10:14.560]   the Word of God. And they were taught that because the Apostles taught them
[01:10:14.560 --> 01:10:21.840]   that. The Apostles taught them that because Jesus said it would happen. So
[01:10:21.840 --> 01:10:28.400]   the power doesn't come from the Apostles. The power comes from God. So let me go
[01:10:28.400 --> 01:10:32.880]   back here. Okay? So I don't want anyone to miss this point. We talk about divine
[01:10:32.880 --> 01:10:36.800]   qualities. We talk about apostolic origins. And we talk about corporate
[01:10:36.800 --> 01:10:44.080]   reception. Those three points are important because God has said so. Okay?
[01:10:44.080 --> 01:10:51.280]   Jesus comes on the scene. He confirms the Old Testament. Right? If the Old Testament
[01:10:51.280 --> 01:10:55.800]   at the time wasn't the Old Testament, he would have said, "Take Job out. Take Psalms
[01:10:55.800 --> 01:11:01.640]   out. Take Deuteronomy out." He doesn't do that. Okay? And remember, this is the same
[01:11:01.640 --> 01:11:06.560]   man who made Lazarus rise from the dead. Do you want to know if Jesus is an
[01:11:06.560 --> 01:11:14.480]   actual historical figure as opposed to a myth? Everyone that saw Jesus, okay,
[01:11:14.480 --> 01:11:21.760]   couldn't deny who he was. Historians who hated Christians wrote that Jesus
[01:11:21.760 --> 01:11:26.680]   existed. Do you know why? Because they couldn't deny who he was. Let me give you
[01:11:26.680 --> 01:11:31.120]   an example. If you're a hardcore Republican and you hate Barack Obama, can
[01:11:31.120 --> 01:11:36.200]   you deny that he was the president? No. No. You can't deny that he was a president.
[01:11:36.200 --> 01:11:40.560]   If you're a hardcore Democrat and you hate Donald Trump, can you deny that he's
[01:11:40.560 --> 01:11:44.400]   the president? No. You can't deny it. You can say, "I don't like him," but you can't
[01:11:44.400 --> 01:11:48.920]   deny it. It's the same thing with Jesus. There were historians commissioned by
[01:11:48.920 --> 01:11:55.360]   Rome who hated Jesus, who hated Christians, but they couldn't deny that
[01:11:55.360 --> 01:11:59.840]   he existed. They couldn't deny it. Do you know why? Because he did everything in
[01:11:59.840 --> 01:12:06.040]   public, which is in direct contradiction to every single religious figure that
[01:12:06.040 --> 01:12:12.520]   has existed through time. No one, not all religions are equal, not all ideas are
[01:12:12.520 --> 01:12:17.560]   equal. That is malarkey. All men are created equal because we're all men and
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:21.760]   women, because we're made in the image of God, but not all ideas are equal, not all
[01:12:21.760 --> 01:12:25.560]   religions are equal. The reason Christianity stands in stark contrast to
[01:12:25.560 --> 01:12:31.200]   every other single religion is because of Jesus Christ, okay? So what happened,
[01:12:31.200 --> 01:12:36.600]   okay, what happened was people would see the risen Christ. He's obviously God
[01:12:36.600 --> 01:12:40.680]   because he's raising people from the dead. You guys can't deny it. Rome can't
[01:12:40.680 --> 01:12:46.080]   deny it. After the fact, they want to squash Christians, so they say, "Deny the
[01:12:46.080 --> 01:12:49.800]   fact that Jesus is the Christ or you die," and you know what a lot of people
[01:12:49.800 --> 01:12:56.000]   chose? They chose death. These are historical facts. So a lot of people who
[01:12:56.000 --> 01:12:59.960]   saw the resurrected Christ said, "I'm not gonna deny him," and they just died. Some
[01:12:59.960 --> 01:13:03.800]   of these people were thrown into the Colosseum. Some of them were lit on fire,
[01:13:03.800 --> 01:13:09.880]   okay? Let me further this for you. I say the same thing in
[01:13:09.880 --> 01:13:14.000]   BCC Lesson 4, but let me give you this other example, okay? If you and I saw the
[01:13:14.000 --> 01:13:17.520]   risen Christ, right, if you and I saw the risen Christ and we don't believe in him,
[01:13:17.520 --> 01:13:22.520]   there's no actual faith, okay? If you put a gun to my head and you say, "Deny Christ
[01:13:22.520 --> 01:13:28.120]   or I'm gonna shoot you," I don't care if it's true. I don't care. I'm just gonna
[01:13:28.120 --> 01:13:35.760]   say, I'm just gonna say, "I deny him." You know why? Even though it's true, I don't
[01:13:35.760 --> 01:13:42.080]   want to die. I don't want to die. So I'm gonna be like, "Yeah, I saw him do all
[01:13:42.080 --> 01:13:45.920]   that, but I don't really care. So yeah, Jesus, yeah, he's, I don't, like, whatever
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:51.440]   they're saying, I disavow everything that they're saying." You and I are gonna do
[01:13:51.440 --> 01:13:59.760]   that. But for some reason, this figure, this man, is different. For some reason,
[01:13:59.760 --> 01:14:05.960]   people saw him, right? People saw him. He claimed he was God. He claimed he was the
[01:14:05.960 --> 01:14:10.960]   Messiah. He claimed that he will give you life. He claimed that you should follow
[01:14:10.960 --> 01:14:18.920]   him. And after that, he rose from the dead and people said, "What do you want me to
[01:14:18.920 --> 01:14:25.320]   do?" The man rose from the dead. "So I'm gonna trust him, even though you kill me.
[01:14:25.320 --> 01:14:31.200]   Just kill me." "Well, I'm gonna throw you and your kid into the Coliseum. I'm gonna
[01:14:31.200 --> 01:14:36.920]   light you on fire, and I'm gonna light your kid on fire." "Well, this is kind of hard."
[01:14:36.920 --> 01:14:43.800]   But I saw him rise from the dead. I saw him rise from the dead. And he told me that
[01:14:43.800 --> 01:14:49.560]   you would kill me. He told me that you were gonna do this to me. I don't want to
[01:14:49.560 --> 01:14:54.840]   die. I don't want to see my kid burned. But I can't deny him. And so a lot of
[01:14:54.840 --> 01:14:59.440]   people face that. So when I tell you Christ confirms the Old Testament canon,
[01:14:59.440 --> 01:15:06.120]   that's the power behind it. Okay? He's not just some other guy, "Oh, this is church, so
[01:15:06.120 --> 01:15:10.720]   when he says Jesus, every correct answer is Jesus." That's not what I'm saying. Okay?
[01:15:10.720 --> 01:15:15.760]   There's a lot that goes into Christ confirming the Old Testament canon. Okay?
[01:15:15.760 --> 01:15:21.560]   If you just reduce it to, "Oh, this is church, so he can say Jesus," right? That
[01:15:21.560 --> 01:15:26.960]   is extremely anti-intellectual. That is extremely anti-intellectual. It is
[01:15:26.960 --> 01:15:31.480]   unfaithful to reason, and frankly, you just probably don't want to believe in
[01:15:31.480 --> 01:15:37.480]   God, and that's why you think that. But it is not because you're intellectual. It is
[01:15:37.480 --> 01:15:41.840]   not because you're intellectual. In fact, it is the exact opposite. Okay? That was a
[01:15:41.840 --> 01:15:45.040]   little pause right there, because I felt like I had to do it. Alright? So let me go
[01:15:45.040 --> 01:15:49.880]   on here. Point number two. The Didache was an early Christian manual of church
[01:15:49.880 --> 01:15:55.200]   practice. Okay? So the Didache, right, is like a manual. It's like an instruction
[01:15:55.200 --> 01:16:00.000]   guide, right? And it had all this scripture in it. It had all this
[01:16:00.000 --> 01:16:05.400]   scripture in it. Tons of scripture. From very early on, let me go back to
[01:16:05.400 --> 01:16:10.440]   something Jude said in verse 3. Chapter 1. There's only one chapter. Verse 3. Right?
[01:16:10.440 --> 01:16:14.400]   It is once for all delivered to the saints. Once for all. It's not this
[01:16:14.400 --> 01:16:18.060]   ongoing thing, "Let's all write scripture. You write scripture. I write
[01:16:18.060 --> 01:16:22.520]   scripture." No. It is once for all delivered to the saints. Right? The fact
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:30.840]   that the Didache, going back to about a hundred AD, encapsulates this. Right? Okay.
[01:16:30.840 --> 01:16:36.600]   Ignatius, Bishop of Antioch, said, he quoted various parts of the New Testament as
[01:16:36.600 --> 01:16:41.680]   saying, "It is written." You only say, "It is written," as if it's God's Word. Polycarp,
[01:16:41.680 --> 01:16:46.200]   quoted from various parts of the New Testament. Papias, Bishop of Hierapolis,
[01:16:46.200 --> 01:16:51.240]   also quoted parts of the New Testament. Okay? You see the apostolic fathers, they
[01:16:51.240 --> 01:16:55.200]   quoted the Gospels and the Apollonian Epistles more frequently than any other work.
[01:16:55.200 --> 01:17:03.840]   They rarely quote outside of the New Testament. Rarely. Christianity was
[01:17:03.840 --> 01:17:07.280]   distinguished from other religions in that it was prolific in the production
[01:17:07.280 --> 01:17:13.960]   of manuscripts. Christianity was interesting. Okay? It was very, very
[01:17:13.960 --> 01:17:19.600]   bookish. Very bookish. When you look in Acts 17, when Paul is on Mars Hill and
[01:17:19.600 --> 01:17:23.200]   he's like saying, "Oh, you guys are all religious," and the philosophers of that
[01:17:23.200 --> 01:17:26.920]   day, they love philosophizing, they love hearing new ideas, and they speak, they
[01:17:26.920 --> 01:17:31.080]   speak, they speak, they speak. That's what they do. Right? Christians, for some reason,
[01:17:31.080 --> 01:17:36.160]   they come on the scene, this weird sect of Judaism, they come on the scene, right?
[01:17:36.160 --> 01:17:40.120]   And they're all about writing. Christianity was distinguished from
[01:17:40.120 --> 01:17:46.680]   other religions and other philosophies of that day in that sense. Other people
[01:17:46.680 --> 01:17:51.760]   groups noted that about Christians. Okay? So by about the fourth century, major
[01:17:51.760 --> 01:17:54.880]   biblical codices contain 27 books of the New Testament we have today.
[01:17:54.880 --> 01:17:59.360]   Sinaiticus, Vaticus, Alexandrus. Okay? The Codex was favored among the parchment
[01:17:59.360 --> 01:18:03.040]   because one could contain multiple works bound together. It also allowed certain
[01:18:03.040 --> 01:18:07.600]   books to be grouped together and certain ones to be left out. Parchment. Right?
[01:18:07.600 --> 01:18:11.000]   Kind of like what you see, like in video games, like when you get a scroll, the
[01:18:11.000 --> 01:18:14.920]   scroll of power or whatever you get, like, you know, you get an upgrade, it's like a
[01:18:14.920 --> 01:18:20.240]   scroll, right? Like it's like you roll it up. You guys have seen that before, right?
[01:18:20.240 --> 01:18:27.840]   But Christianity comes on the scene and it favors a codex. A codex is more like a
[01:18:27.840 --> 01:18:32.760]   book that we have. Think of like a photo album. Put stuff in, take stuff out, has a
[01:18:32.760 --> 01:18:39.240]   has a binding here. Christianity seems to favor that. Why is that? On a parchment,
[01:18:39.240 --> 01:18:45.080]   you can carry so many books, right? It's not very efficient, right? Like it
[01:18:45.080 --> 01:18:50.840]   preserves what's inside, so that's great, right? But I mean, how are you gonna carry
[01:18:50.840 --> 01:18:59.040]   like, like 27 parchments? But with a codex, oh, with a codex you can do that. With a
[01:18:59.040 --> 01:19:04.600]   binding, you can actually do that. For some strange reason, Christianity comes
[01:19:04.600 --> 01:19:12.360]   on the scene and immediately favors codices. Immediately. That is consistent
[01:19:12.360 --> 01:19:15.920]   with the compilation of the New Testament. That is consistent with the
[01:19:15.920 --> 01:19:19.120]   compilation of the New Testament.
[01:19:19.120 --> 01:19:25.320]   140 AD, Marcion the Gnostic appears in the scene and states that the canon
[01:19:25.320 --> 01:19:29.840]   consisted of an edited version of Luke and 10 of Paul's epistles. So this
[01:19:29.840 --> 01:19:33.520]   dude named Marcion, right? We'll just call him Mark the Heretic, okay? Mark the
[01:19:33.520 --> 01:19:37.280]   Heretic, he comes on the scene and says, "This is the Bible. This is the Bible."
[01:19:37.280 --> 01:19:43.480]   About 140 AD, right? So around that time, right, generally people already understood
[01:19:43.480 --> 01:19:46.960]   what the New Testament was. But this dude comes on the scene and says, "This is
[01:19:46.960 --> 01:19:51.560]   actually the Bible." So now Christianity is being challenged, right? So because of
[01:19:51.560 --> 01:19:58.120]   this man's heresy, they got to prove that this man's heresy is not truth, right? So
[01:19:58.120 --> 01:20:04.760]   because of that, they engage Marcion, okay? By 200 AD, as a result of, probably as a
[01:20:04.760 --> 01:20:08.160]   result of that, the New Testament was already established and we know that in
[01:20:08.160 --> 01:20:12.880]   the Muratorian Fragment. The Muratorian Fragment contains, it's like a list, right?
[01:20:12.880 --> 01:20:19.960]   So there's this fragment, goes to about 200 AD, and it lists all the books of the
[01:20:19.960 --> 01:20:25.480]   New Testament. Guess what? It validates our New Testament. And it was probably a
[01:20:25.480 --> 01:20:32.880]   result of Marcion's heresy. So because of this guy's heresy, someone's like, "Prove to
[01:20:32.880 --> 01:20:37.040]   me that this isn't the Bible. Prove to me," right? So because of that, they're like,
[01:20:37.040 --> 01:20:42.680]   "Well, let's get organized and let's deal with this knucklehead," right? And so these
[01:20:42.680 --> 01:20:47.700]   lists start to form. In the early 300s, Origen's list also contains our New
[01:20:47.700 --> 01:20:52.600]   Testament, while noting that some of the epistles were debated. Around the same
[01:20:52.600 --> 01:20:56.920]   time as Origen, Eusebius also lists much of our New Testament. In 367,
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:21:01.720]   Athanasian's letter contains our New Testament today, which is corroborated by
[01:21:01.720 --> 01:21:05.880]   Jerome and Augustine. Council of Hippo and Carthage also confirm the New
[01:21:05.880 --> 01:21:09.080]   Testament we have today. And this makes complete sense if one understands the
[01:21:09.080 --> 01:21:14.080]   history of the Church. The first 300 years of the Church, there was intense
[01:21:14.080 --> 01:21:18.160]   persecution. It wasn't like they're doing nothing. They're just like, "Oh, like, hey,
[01:21:18.160 --> 01:21:22.120]   what should we do today?" There's intense persecution. The moment they
[01:21:22.120 --> 01:21:25.960]   get under that, you see this consensus with respect to the New Testament, okay?
[01:21:25.960 --> 01:21:30.560]   Now, when I say consensus, let me say that again. You see this apparent organized
[01:21:30.560 --> 01:21:36.400]   consensus. The consensus already existed, okay? The consensus already existed, right?
[01:21:36.400 --> 01:21:40.880]   We see that with the Didache. We see that with the Apostolic Fathers. So the
[01:21:40.880 --> 01:21:45.400]   consensus already existed, but then the heretics, or the ones that
[01:21:45.400 --> 01:21:51.120]   actually had some juice to them, started to appear. And so you see this
[01:21:51.120 --> 01:22:00.920]   godly reaction to combat the heretics, okay? Okay. So there's this chart that I
[01:22:00.920 --> 01:22:06.840]   just ripped off a book, right? So divine qualities, apostolic origins, and corporate
[01:22:06.840 --> 01:22:11.000]   reception, right? If you see that graphic right there, right? They represent the
[01:22:11.000 --> 01:22:16.120]   attributes of canonicity, right? And it is within the context of the Holy Spirit.
[01:22:16.120 --> 01:22:20.440]   That's why it is self-authenticating, okay? I want you to remember something.
[01:22:20.440 --> 01:22:25.960]   John 1.1, "In the beginning was the Word, the Word was with God, and the Word was
[01:22:25.960 --> 01:22:34.080]   God." If the Word was God, what is greater than God that can authenticate God?
[01:22:34.080 --> 01:22:38.760]   There's nothing greater than God. That's why it has to be self-authenticating,
[01:22:38.760 --> 01:22:44.040]   right? He says it another way. Hebrews 6.3, "Since he could swear by no one greater,
[01:22:44.040 --> 01:22:54.040]   he swore by himself." Himself. What's God gonna swear by when it
[01:22:54.040 --> 01:22:59.240]   comes to his Word? "I swear to you that this is true." There's nothing
[01:22:59.240 --> 01:23:03.280]   else he could swear by. When he says something's gonna happen to give you and
[01:23:03.280 --> 01:23:07.560]   I comfort, he says, "I swear by who?" There's no one greater than God. He has to swear
[01:23:07.560 --> 01:23:15.200]   by himself. If the Word was God, okay, the Logos, right? And he could swear by
[01:23:15.200 --> 01:23:22.000]   himself, of course the attributes of the Canon, of course the criteria of the
[01:23:22.000 --> 01:23:26.360]   Canon, of course it's going to be self-authenticating. There's nothing
[01:23:26.360 --> 01:23:32.920]   greater than God. Let me say this again. It is not cheap. It is not intellectually
[01:23:32.920 --> 01:23:39.200]   cheap. Everything that is foundational is self-authenticating. Everything that is
[01:23:39.200 --> 01:23:46.400]   foundational. Everything is self-authenticating, okay? If you want to
[01:23:46.400 --> 01:23:53.680]   hit me up and get into a philosophical discussion about that, I will, okay?
[01:23:53.680 --> 01:24:00.320]   What is Scripture's position on Scripture? "For no prophecy was ever made
[01:24:00.320 --> 01:24:05.960]   by an act of human will, but men moved by the Holy Spirit spoke from God." That is
[01:24:05.960 --> 01:24:10.800]   Scripture's position on Scripture. Men didn't write it, God wrote it. "I testify
[01:24:10.800 --> 01:24:14.120]   to everyone who hears the words of the prophecy of this book, if anyone adds to
[01:24:14.120 --> 01:24:17.400]   them, God will add to him the plagues which are written in this book. If anyone takes away
[01:24:17.400 --> 01:24:20.160]   from the words of this book of this prophecy, God will take away his part
[01:24:20.160 --> 01:24:24.840]   from the tree of life and from the holy city which are written in this book."
[01:24:27.680 --> 01:24:35.240]   That's four o'clock. John 10 27. "My sheep hear my voice and I know them and they
[01:24:35.240 --> 01:24:40.400]   follow me." That's what Jesus said, right? "My sheep hear my voice, I know them and
[01:24:40.400 --> 01:24:46.800]   they follow me." So wouldn't the people who are going to be Christian validate
[01:24:46.800 --> 01:24:53.240]   God's Word? Jesus said, "My sheep hear my voice, I know them and they follow me. A
[01:24:53.240 --> 01:24:57.240]   stranger they simply will not follow, but will free from him because they do not
[01:24:57.240 --> 01:25:03.840]   know the voice of strangers. The church will receive his Word. They will be able
[01:25:03.840 --> 01:25:10.440]   to deduce what is not God's Word." Okay? Romans 15 4. "For whatever was written in
[01:25:10.440 --> 01:25:13.360]   earlier times was written for our instruction so that through perseverance
[01:25:13.360 --> 01:25:16.320]   and encouragement of the Scriptures we might have hope." Whatever was written in
[01:25:16.320 --> 01:25:24.720]   earlier times was written for our instruction. We will have God's Word. All
[01:25:24.720 --> 01:25:28.280]   Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting, and
[01:25:28.280 --> 01:25:32.720]   training. If all Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking,
[01:25:32.720 --> 01:25:38.080]   correcting, and training, would he not give it to us? Would we somehow mess this
[01:25:38.080 --> 01:25:43.920]   up? We're not gonna mess it up. Not because we're great, but because Christ
[01:25:43.920 --> 01:25:50.960]   promised. John 14 and John chapter 16. Isaiah 55, just to reinforce this point.
[01:25:50.960 --> 01:25:56.720]   "So will my word be which goes forth from my mouth. It will not
[01:25:56.720 --> 01:26:01.280]   return to me empty without accomplishing what I desire and without succeeding in
[01:26:01.280 --> 01:26:06.480]   the matter for which I sent it. All the inhabitants of the earth are accounted
[01:26:06.480 --> 01:26:14.000]   as nothing, but he does according to his will." You think man can stop God from
[01:26:14.000 --> 01:26:21.360]   giving his word to his church? I don't think so. Ephesians 1, "Also we have
[01:26:21.360 --> 01:26:24.400]   obtained inheritance having been predestined according to his purpose, who works all
[01:26:24.400 --> 01:26:30.760]   things after the counsel of his will." He works all things. All the inhabitants of
[01:26:30.760 --> 01:26:37.200]   the earth are accounted as nothing. His word will not return void. It will
[01:26:37.200 --> 01:26:47.640]   succeed. With respect to the canon of Scripture. Okay? With respect to the canon
[01:26:47.640 --> 01:26:54.720]   of Scripture, if it has divine qualities, it will also have apostolic origins and
[01:26:54.720 --> 01:27:00.720]   the church will receive it as such. With respect to the canon of Scripture, I'm
[01:27:00.720 --> 01:27:05.240]   pretty proud of that. If it has apostolic origins, it will have divine qualities
[01:27:05.240 --> 01:27:14.040]   and the church will receive it as such. Because his sheep hear his voice.
[01:27:14.040 --> 01:27:21.800]   Who wrote the first five books? Moses. Was Moses around when he wrote when
[01:27:21.800 --> 01:27:25.120]   God created the world? No, he wasn't around. He wasn't like observing God.
[01:27:25.120 --> 01:27:29.040]   That's cool you like made Adam. That's cool, right? Because Adam was the first
[01:27:29.040 --> 01:27:34.480]   man, right? So it was given to Moses. I'm using this Old Testament example because
[01:27:34.480 --> 01:27:38.120]   it's not anything new in the New Testament, right? So when Christ
[01:27:38.120 --> 01:27:43.920]   commissions his apostles, the Holy Spirit, John chapter 14, John chapter 16, he's
[01:27:43.920 --> 01:27:47.680]   going to teach you all things. He's going to guide you into all truth. He's gonna
[01:27:47.680 --> 01:27:50.760]   make you remember everything I said. I want to tell you more but you can't bear
[01:27:50.760 --> 01:27:55.920]   it now, right? But you're going to do this. The Apostle said, "I received this from
[01:27:55.920 --> 01:28:02.080]   Jesus." Right? You have divine qualities. You have apostolic origins. And then the
[01:28:02.080 --> 01:28:08.560]   church, Jesus said what? "My sheep hear my voice. My sheep hear my voice." Who dwells
[01:28:08.560 --> 01:28:14.760]   in you? God dwells in you. God is going to react to his word. Divine qualities,
[01:28:14.760 --> 01:28:23.480]   apostolic origins, corporate reception. That's that in a nutshell, okay? Because
[01:28:23.480 --> 01:28:30.200]   Christ said it. Because Christ said it, right? And if you don't believe him, this
[01:28:30.200 --> 01:28:34.480]   is a very logical argument from Christ. "At least believe me because of the works
[01:28:34.480 --> 01:28:39.400]   that I do." That's what Jesus said. You don't believe me? Then how in the world
[01:28:39.400 --> 01:28:43.160]   am I doing all this, right? If you don't believe him, at least believe the works.
[01:28:43.160 --> 01:28:47.760]   And go read a book, take a look at history, and take a look at all the
[01:28:47.760 --> 01:28:51.520]   people, all the men and women that died because they saw Christ, right? Okay.
[01:28:51.520 --> 01:28:55.400]   That's enough of that, alright? So that's the canon of
[01:28:55.400 --> 01:29:00.400]   Scripture. Okay. I'm gonna answer one question here, right? What about the
[01:29:00.400 --> 01:29:04.840]   Catholic Bible? What about the Catholic Bible, right? Okay. The Catholic Bible
[01:29:04.840 --> 01:29:07.640]   contains what is known as the Old Testament Apocrypha. There is a New
[01:29:07.640 --> 01:29:10.280]   Testament Apocrypha, but no one accepts the New Testament Apocrypha, okay? Just
[01:29:10.280 --> 01:29:13.600]   throw that out the door, okay? The Catholics have other books within the
[01:29:13.600 --> 01:29:20.640]   Old Testament, okay? Tobit, 1st and 2nd Maccabees, and some others, okay? That's
[01:29:20.640 --> 01:29:27.000]   where they get the idea of purgatory, from the Apocrypha. But you don't see the
[01:29:27.000 --> 01:29:31.560]   idea of purgatory in any other book except the Apocrypha. It fails the test
[01:29:31.560 --> 01:29:36.600]   of doctrinal unity. Number two, did Jesus ever quote from any book of the
[01:29:36.600 --> 01:29:43.760]   Apocrypha? No. No. He never quoted from the Apocrypha. Do you know why? Because
[01:29:43.760 --> 01:29:48.880]   it's not God's Word. Because it's not God's Word, okay?
[01:29:48.880 --> 01:29:56.200]   Number three, okay? Early on, they were not accepted. Now you might find, you might
[01:29:56.200 --> 01:30:00.720]   find, this could be God's Word, but generally speaking, they were not
[01:30:00.720 --> 01:30:06.160]   accepted as God's Word. You know what else? You know what else? Even the
[01:30:06.160 --> 01:30:11.040]   Catholic Church, although they recognized the Apocrypha, they, the Catholic Church,
[01:30:11.040 --> 01:30:14.680]   I'm not talking about the, some council here, some council there, I'm talking
[01:30:14.680 --> 01:30:18.320]   about the Catholic Church at the time did not recognize the Apocrypha as God's
[01:30:18.320 --> 01:30:24.520]   Word. That happened in the 16th century, okay? So from very early on, the Apocrypha
[01:30:24.520 --> 01:30:29.120]   was not counted as God's Word, from very early on, okay? And when you look at the
[01:30:29.120 --> 01:30:33.120]   quotations, that it is written and stuff like that, they come from our New
[01:30:33.120 --> 01:30:36.680]   Testament, from the early Church Fathers or whatever else, okay? The early Church,
[01:30:36.680 --> 01:30:41.880]   so the Apostolic Fathers, and there's ones after that. Is there a
[01:30:41.880 --> 01:30:50.380]   document somewhere that says the Apocrypha is God's Word? Yes. Yes. There
[01:30:50.380 --> 01:30:56.600]   is documents out there, okay? But if you look at it in its totality, right, there's
[01:30:56.600 --> 01:31:00.400]   a lot of forgeries out there, and the way you can siphon out the forgeries from
[01:31:00.400 --> 01:31:03.760]   what's actually God's Word is there's, there's, there's an analysis to this,
[01:31:03.760 --> 01:31:08.160]   right? Does it have doctrinal unity? How many copies are there, and how many times
[01:31:08.160 --> 01:31:12.920]   are they quoted as Scripture? If you do the analysis, it's the New Testament and
[01:31:12.920 --> 01:31:17.600]   the Old Testament that we have today. You know what's another, like the final nail
[01:31:17.600 --> 01:31:25.080]   in the coffin? The Old Testament that the Jews use, Israel uses, is the Old Testament
[01:31:25.080 --> 01:31:31.400]   that we use, not the Catholic one. Alright? So that's, that's, that's the Apocrypha.
[01:31:31.400 --> 01:31:40.360]   Okay. I want to take questions. Don't be afraid. Ask me questions. Yes.
[01:31:40.360 --> 01:31:45.080]   Masoretic.
[01:31:45.080 --> 01:31:49.920]   900 to 1000 AD.
[01:31:49.920 --> 01:31:59.760]   Why did the Masoretes stop reproducing it?
[01:32:00.760 --> 01:32:13.880]   Oh, I see, I see your question. I do know why. They were, I want to make sure I get
[01:32:13.880 --> 01:32:20.040]   this right, they were eventually conquered. And I want to make, I don't
[01:32:20.040 --> 01:32:23.600]   want to give you fake news, and I don't want to, because there's a lot of tribes,
[01:32:23.600 --> 01:32:27.640]   but if I remember correctly, they were, they were conquered. And so that, and
[01:32:27.640 --> 01:32:33.200]   that was, that was the reason why they were eventually dispersed. So the copies
[01:32:33.200 --> 01:32:36.760]   that we have date to around that time.
[01:32:57.280 --> 01:33:03.840]   So which manuscripts does our English Bible use? Is that the question?
[01:33:03.840 --> 01:33:15.200]   Yes. Let me, let me say this, okay? There are two kind of general codices, two
[01:33:15.200 --> 01:33:21.400]   general ones, okay? So these two general ones are slightly different, okay? So then
[01:33:21.400 --> 01:33:25.320]   you have the King James and the New King James kind of using this one, and then
[01:33:25.320 --> 01:33:31.920]   you have like nearly all the other translations using this one, okay? Without
[01:33:31.920 --> 01:33:38.960]   getting into the weeds too much, they're generally identical, but the one that the
[01:33:38.960 --> 01:33:44.960]   King James and New King James uses, right, they have a couple more verses. One
[01:33:44.960 --> 01:33:49.920]   example is in 1st John chapter 5, when it talks about the Trinity, and King James
[01:33:49.920 --> 01:33:53.640]   and New King James, I think it's chapter 5, it directly says there are three that
[01:33:53.640 --> 01:33:58.400]   testify, the Father, God, and the Holy Spirit, right? Now that's, that's like a direct
[01:33:58.400 --> 01:34:03.720]   statement of the Trinity, right? The, the text that we use, it doesn't have that
[01:34:03.720 --> 01:34:10.840]   verse, okay? So the two major codices have like a couple verses that are different,
[01:34:10.840 --> 01:34:16.800]   right? So then the one we use, for various reasons, that, the one we use seem to be a
[01:34:16.800 --> 01:34:21.400]   little bit more accurate. And then if I, to do the analysis of that, we'll take a
[01:34:21.400 --> 01:34:28.400]   little bit of time, but to answer your question, yes. Yes. That, that codicy is
[01:34:28.400 --> 01:34:34.680]   based upon the compilation of the manuscripts that we have, also the copies
[01:34:34.680 --> 01:34:40.040]   of the manuscripts that we have. That makes sense. So there, there aren't any
[01:34:40.040 --> 01:34:45.440]   like original letter, they're all, they're all destroyed. Like, we don't have the
[01:34:45.440 --> 01:34:51.560]   original Colossians. Like, we don't, we don't have that, right? But the fact that
[01:34:51.560 --> 01:34:55.960]   we don't have like an original copy doesn't mean that we don't have the
[01:34:55.960 --> 01:35:00.360]   original content. And the reason that's not true is because we know that this
[01:35:00.360 --> 01:35:04.480]   letter was disseminated and we know that it was copied, and when, remember, when they
[01:35:04.480 --> 01:35:08.960]   copied it, they knew it was the Word of God. So there were all these copies, right?
[01:35:08.960 --> 01:35:15.120]   So theoretically, just keep this in mind, if you have the Word of God and they
[01:35:15.120 --> 01:35:19.520]   understood it to be the Word of God, and there's a hundred copies of this, but we
[01:35:19.520 --> 01:35:23.200]   don't have the original. But everyone's saying there's a hundred copies and
[01:35:23.200 --> 01:35:27.360]   they're all identical, right? Do you think the hundred copies that are like word
[01:35:27.360 --> 01:35:33.000]   for word, letter for letter, identical? Is that a copy of the original? Yeah. Yeah.
[01:35:33.000 --> 01:35:37.320]   It definitely, it's not gonna be like a hundred different copies and they're all
[01:35:37.320 --> 01:35:43.240]   wrong, but the original is now gone, so we're just, we're just toast, right? That's
[01:35:43.240 --> 01:35:49.440]   not the case at all. So we don't have any originals, but we have copies, right? And
[01:35:49.440 --> 01:35:54.280]   then copies upon copies, right? And then there's like, like the earliest ones, they
[01:35:54.280 --> 01:35:58.760]   have them like, they give them like P, P designations, like P52 and the fragments
[01:35:58.760 --> 01:36:02.320]   of John, and that's kind of getting into the weeds. Just, just generally speaking.
[01:36:02.320 --> 01:36:05.280]   That's, that's how it works.
[01:36:05.280 --> 01:36:11.760]   The New England translation claims to use the same codices as in major
[01:36:11.760 --> 01:36:16.120]   translations, but then they add in their own words. They like, they're different.
[01:36:16.120 --> 01:36:20.360]   So they say like, we're using this codicy, right? We're using this
[01:36:20.360 --> 01:36:25.040]   codex, right? We're using this, and then they just add words. It literally comes
[01:36:25.040 --> 01:36:28.960]   from nowhere. Like it straight up comes from nowhere. I'm not just saying that
[01:36:28.960 --> 01:36:32.080]   because I'm not a Jehovah's Witness. I'm saying that because that's intellectually,
[01:36:32.080 --> 01:36:36.280]   factually correct. Like they'll, they'll like, they'll read a text and they'll
[01:36:36.280 --> 01:36:39.560]   just like insert a word in there and say, well that's, that's what the Bible says
[01:36:39.560 --> 01:36:48.200]   and that's not true. Like it's, it's really that simple. Yeah. Yes.
[01:36:48.200 --> 01:37:00.320]   The Dead Sea Scrolls, right? Yeah. The Cumbrian community, so they were, they were
[01:37:00.320 --> 01:37:07.520]   also a, a kind of like, think of like monks. They were kind of like monks and
[01:37:07.520 --> 01:37:11.120]   they were all about like, we're gonna separate ourselves, we're gonna live in
[01:37:11.120 --> 01:37:14.800]   these caves, we're gonna have the Word of God, that, that's the community. And so
[01:37:14.800 --> 01:37:18.240]   they kept all these scrolls. So they were like, we're gonna preserve God's Word,
[01:37:18.240 --> 01:37:22.240]   come out of the world, we're not gonna associate with them. So they're all about
[01:37:22.240 --> 01:37:26.280]   like, you know, keeping God's Word and obeying God's Word, except that they were
[01:37:26.280 --> 01:37:31.600]   kind of like, just did it in a monkish way, right? It is from that community that
[01:37:31.600 --> 01:37:37.200]   we find texts that validate the, that validate the Masoretic text.
[01:37:37.200 --> 01:37:43.760]   Yes.
[01:37:43.760 --> 01:37:51.200]   I'm sorry, the what? Yeah.
[01:37:51.200 --> 01:38:00.640]   Yes. He wrote them because he says, because of what he says. If, if anyone
[01:38:00.640 --> 01:38:06.840]   thinks he's spiritual, let him recognize what I'm writing to is God's Word. Yeah.
[01:38:06.840 --> 01:38:21.800]   Oh, so if you study those books, if you study those books, they speak of
[01:38:21.800 --> 01:38:30.120]   doctrinal disunity. Like, so like, the teaching of purgatory comes from Tobit,
[01:38:30.120 --> 01:38:35.040]   which is a book of the Apocrypha, right? And other books too. I'm pretty sure,
[01:38:35.040 --> 01:38:41.440]   but it comes from the Apocrypha, right? And so when you look at the
[01:38:41.440 --> 01:38:46.160]   Apocrypha and you see what they teach, it doesn't come from any other book. You
[01:38:46.160 --> 01:38:51.960]   don't, you don't see a purgatory in any other book except the Apocrypha. Yeah. So
[01:38:51.960 --> 01:38:56.720]   so that, that's, that's one example. But that's a, that's a huge example, you
[01:38:56.720 --> 01:39:01.520]   know, like, because the Scripture is talking about it's once and for all. You
[01:39:01.520 --> 01:39:05.720]   die, there is no second chance. Like, oh I messed up and now I'm gonna be for real
[01:39:05.720 --> 01:39:10.800]   good. There's nothing like that, right? But the Apocrypha speaks to a different
[01:39:10.800 --> 01:39:16.200]   destination than the rest of the books, right? So with the Apocrypha, you have the
[01:39:16.200 --> 01:39:19.920]   argument from doctrinal disunity, but you also have the argument from the fact
[01:39:19.920 --> 01:39:25.400]   that it's not from apostolic origins, right? And on top, well, it's all times, so
[01:39:25.400 --> 01:39:29.880]   prophetic origins, right? Which is the corollary of apostolic origins. And on
[01:39:29.880 --> 01:39:34.880]   top of that, they didn't receive it as God's Word. The Jews didn't receive it as
[01:39:34.880 --> 01:39:41.040]   God's Word, right? Going back to the fact that the Jews today, they, they also don't
[01:39:41.040 --> 01:39:45.120]   recognize the Apocrypha as part of God's Word. The other interesting factoid about
[01:39:45.120 --> 01:39:50.720]   the Apocrypha is that, I think all of it, yeah, all of it was written within the
[01:39:50.720 --> 01:39:57.060]   intertestamental period, right? That period after Malachi, but before John the
[01:39:57.060 --> 01:40:00.640]   Baptist. Malachi's the last prophet, right guys? Malachi's the last Old Testament
[01:40:00.640 --> 01:40:05.560]   prophet, and then there's radio silence. No one's, there's no, God doesn't send
[01:40:05.560 --> 01:40:10.600]   anyone, right? And then John the Baptist occurs. So the, the Apocrypha is from this
[01:40:10.600 --> 01:40:18.360]   time when God is silent, right? So that's also interesting, because God is silent.
[01:40:18.360 --> 01:40:48.340]   [Pause]
[01:40:48.340 --> 01:40:52.340]   What was the last thing you said?
[01:40:52.340 --> 01:41:12.340]   [Pause]
[01:41:12.340 --> 01:41:17.740]   Well, it is true that there is variance, like, within, like, everyone who calls
[01:41:17.740 --> 01:41:22.900]   themselves a Jew, but generally speaking, they go by the same Old Testament that
[01:41:22.900 --> 01:41:27.900]   we have. Like, just, just, just, like, just generally speaking. They do have other
[01:41:27.900 --> 01:41:31.380]   texts that are, could be seen as authoritative depending on, like, what kind
[01:41:31.380 --> 01:41:37.180]   of Jew you are, like, what kind of, like, like, yeah, like, kind of, like, their own, like,
[01:41:37.180 --> 01:41:44.580]   kind of version of, like, denominations. But as a whole, the Old Testament that we
[01:41:44.580 --> 01:41:49.140]   have is the one they have. So they typically won't necessarily give
[01:41:49.140 --> 01:41:55.300]   credence to texts that are outside, with the caveat that there are some who, like,
[01:41:55.300 --> 01:42:03.580]   really uphold some, like, rabbinical writings, right? In theory, just
[01:42:03.580 --> 01:42:07.440]   cerebrally, they'll say that that's not God's Word, but, like, sometimes in
[01:42:07.440 --> 01:42:18.940]   practice, they, they treat it as such. I mean, yeah, I, I guess my approach would be, I
[01:42:18.940 --> 01:42:25.020]   guess my approach would be, if I were arguing, if I was talking to someone who
[01:42:25.020 --> 01:42:33.780]   treated a non-canonical Old Testament book as canonical, like a Jew, I would
[01:42:33.780 --> 01:42:39.120]   remind him that it was not spoken of by a prophet. That's what I would do.
[01:42:39.120 --> 01:42:42.620]   That, I would just say it's not spoken of by a prophet. That's, that's kind of, like,
[01:42:42.620 --> 01:42:45.780]   how I would leave it as. And it might have been tradition that you guys
[01:42:45.780 --> 01:42:50.180]   accepted as such, with such high regard, but it is not spoken of, it's not in the
[01:42:50.180 --> 01:42:54.380]   same vein as an Isaiah or a Daniel, yeah. But I see your point, though. If you want to, like,
[01:42:54.380 --> 01:42:59.960]   argue with someone about why Christ is the Messiah, you have to look at the
[01:42:59.960 --> 01:43:05.020]   texts from the Old Testament that we share. So I understand why you'd ask that
[01:43:05.020 --> 01:43:17.180]   question, yeah. Okay. I'll take more. I'll take more. Okay, I want, okay, you know,
[01:43:17.180 --> 01:43:24.540]   I want to ask you guys a question. Does anyone, and I don't want you to feel like,
[01:43:24.540 --> 01:43:28.140]   "Oh my gosh, I'm not a good Christian," okay? Don't feel like that, because I want you
[01:43:28.140 --> 01:43:34.060]   to not hide, like, if you have a question and, like, I can answer it, I want to
[01:43:34.060 --> 01:43:37.380]   answer it, because if you have a question, maybe someone else has the same question
[01:43:37.380 --> 01:43:40.220]   but they're afraid to answer. Don't be like, "Well, you know, they're gonna think I'm
[01:43:40.220 --> 01:43:44.940]   not a good Christian." Don't think like that, okay? Does everyone, does
[01:43:44.940 --> 01:43:50.980]   everyone understand why the canon has to be self-authenticating? And if you
[01:43:50.980 --> 01:43:57.020]   understand why the canon has to be self-authenticating, why it is still
[01:43:57.020 --> 01:44:02.020]   extremely powerful that it is self-authenticating? Is everyone
[01:44:02.020 --> 01:44:07.260]   with me on that? Does anyone think, "Well, it's self-authenticating so it's
[01:44:07.260 --> 01:44:11.140]   cheap." Does anyone, like, honestly, if you feel that way, just
[01:44:11.140 --> 01:44:18.580]   let me know and I want to kind of walk you through why. No one feels that way?
[01:44:19.380 --> 01:44:28.460]   Okay, yeah, I'll walk you through why. Thank you. So I want to go back to foundationally,
[01:44:28.460 --> 01:44:33.900]   okay? Foundationally, right? We talk about Jesus Christ being the center, right? And
[01:44:33.900 --> 01:44:39.380]   He is the center, okay? Jesus Christ is the absolute center. What's the
[01:44:39.380 --> 01:44:44.660]   difference between a Jew and a Christian? If Isaiah, the prophet Isaiah, if he were
[01:44:44.660 --> 01:44:50.060]   alive today, if the prophet Daniel were alive today, right, he would believe in
[01:44:50.060 --> 01:44:56.540]   Christ because he is the Messiah. Isaiah, Daniel, Joel, Malachi, they were all Yahweh
[01:44:56.540 --> 01:45:02.340]   believers. They were all God-fearers. If you are a God-fearer, you will believe in
[01:45:02.340 --> 01:45:08.020]   Jesus. There is no difference in philosophy with respect to Judaism and
[01:45:08.020 --> 01:45:14.620]   Christianity. The difference is Jesus Christ. What do you do with Jesus? Jesus
[01:45:14.620 --> 01:45:21.520]   is the central figure. He explained to mankind what is good and what is evil. He
[01:45:21.520 --> 01:45:26.340]   explained to mankind where you are from and where you are going. He explained to
[01:45:26.340 --> 01:45:32.380]   mankind what is meaning in life. And He explained all of that to mankind. He
[01:45:32.380 --> 01:45:39.220]   paved the way. He was the way. He was God. Jesus is the central figure. He proved
[01:45:39.220 --> 01:45:45.860]   that. He proved that by performing miracles. But his last miracle was he
[01:45:45.860 --> 01:45:52.460]   rose from the dead. You want to see power? Rise from the dead, right? That is the
[01:45:52.460 --> 01:45:58.180]   ultimate power. He actually rose from the dead. Nothing beats that, right? You can
[01:45:58.180 --> 01:46:02.080]   you can't even kill a Superman, right? I mean, nothing beats that power, right? He
[01:46:02.080 --> 01:46:08.340]   actually rose from the dead, okay? So Christ rises from the dead, okay? That's
[01:46:08.340 --> 01:46:14.620]   the power that this man had. This man, Jesus, confirms the Old Testament that we
[01:46:14.620 --> 01:46:19.260]   have today. He confirmed it. I went through it. I showed you how he confirmed it. He
[01:46:19.260 --> 01:46:23.540]   confirmed it. Old Testament that you have, that's the Old Testament. Give you the
[01:46:23.540 --> 01:46:27.580]   thumbs up, okay? So the Old Testament we have is the Old Testament, right? And then he says,
[01:46:27.580 --> 01:46:32.140]   "These guys are gonna write the New Testament. You're gonna write the New
[01:46:32.140 --> 01:46:35.220]   Testament. You're gonna write the New Testament." The guys who wrote the New
[01:46:35.220 --> 01:46:39.100]   Testament said, "We received it from the Lord. We received it from the Lord. We
[01:46:39.100 --> 01:46:43.420]   received it from the Lord," right? And then Christ also said, "Those who receive you
[01:46:43.420 --> 01:46:48.600]   receive me," right? When you tell people of what I tell you, they're gonna know
[01:46:48.600 --> 01:46:54.420]   it's from me. And then what happened? The Apostles told the Word. The Church
[01:46:54.420 --> 01:46:59.820]   received it as from Christ, because my sheep hear my voice, right? So you have
[01:46:59.820 --> 01:47:03.140]   Christ saying, "These guys are gonna, you guys are gonna write the New Testament,"
[01:47:03.140 --> 01:47:08.020]   and those other guys that you tell, if they're my sheep, they're gonna hear my
[01:47:08.020 --> 01:47:13.380]   voice. The Apostles, what do they do? They tell. And what do the sheep do? They hear
[01:47:13.380 --> 01:47:20.940]   the voice. Who does the glory go to? Jesus. Jesus. Because he's the key. He's the key
[01:47:20.940 --> 01:47:25.820]   to the canon. No one is greater than Jesus, so it has to be self-authenticating.
[01:47:25.820 --> 01:47:30.260]   It has to be. There isn't some outside source, right? And if you want to get
[01:47:30.260 --> 01:47:33.900]   technical here, yeah, I guess God, because he said, "This is my son in whom I'm
[01:47:33.900 --> 01:47:37.940]   well-pleased," right? But Jesus is God, right? So without like splitting
[01:47:37.940 --> 01:47:42.300]   hairs here, right? Christ is the key to the Old Testament canon. That's why it must be
[01:47:42.300 --> 01:47:46.920]   self-authenticating, because no one is greater than God. And that is why, that is
[01:47:46.920 --> 01:47:52.020]   why it is not intellectually dishonest. It is not intellectually dishonest,
[01:47:52.020 --> 01:47:56.380]   because how are you going to prove sensory perception? By employing your
[01:47:56.380 --> 01:48:02.980]   sensories, your sensory, your senses, excuse me. How would you, how would you
[01:48:02.980 --> 01:48:06.980]   define sense? You have to employ it. And by the virtue of employing it, you see if
[01:48:06.980 --> 01:48:11.420]   it works. That's how you do. How do you prove that two is two? It is
[01:48:11.420 --> 01:48:16.740]   foundational. It's just, it's foundational. How do you prove that two is two? That you
[01:48:16.740 --> 01:48:21.020]   just make a point. When you use the number two as two, did it work? You were
[01:48:21.020 --> 01:48:24.980]   able to make a point, because it corresponds with reality. So anything
[01:48:24.980 --> 01:48:29.700]   that is foundational is self-authenticating. Anything. God is
[01:48:29.700 --> 01:48:35.360]   foundational. So the Word of God must be self-authenticating. Okay? That's super
[01:48:35.360 --> 01:48:41.420]   dense, super dense, but it's in Scripture, right? God swore by himself. It's in
[01:48:41.420 --> 01:48:44.060]   Scripture. He doesn't say it like that. He doesn't, God doesn't say, "This is super
[01:48:44.060 --> 01:48:47.500]   dense, guys, so get ready." He doesn't say it like that, right? But he did tell us.
[01:48:47.500 --> 01:48:55.660]   Just in a different way. Thank you. Okay. Question, yeah?
[01:48:55.660 --> 01:49:00.340]   Mm-hmm.
[01:49:00.340 --> 01:49:06.820]   Mm-hmm.
[01:49:08.940 --> 01:49:16.220]   Where are contemporary commentaries rooted from? Okay. So generally,
[01:49:16.220 --> 01:49:20.020]   contemporary commentaries, okay, so there's like different types of
[01:49:20.020 --> 01:49:24.860]   commentaries, but generally speaking, what a commentator will do, and I don't
[01:49:24.860 --> 01:49:27.500]   want to say all commentators, but generally speaking, what a commentator
[01:49:27.500 --> 01:49:31.700]   will do is he will look at the language, like the original language, but he will
[01:49:31.700 --> 01:49:37.540]   also look at different verses that relate to this verse, right? So for
[01:49:37.540 --> 01:49:42.460]   example, for example, right, a lot of what you see in Revelation, like a lot of what
[01:49:42.460 --> 01:49:47.340]   you see in Revelation is talked about in the book of Daniel. So they will go to
[01:49:47.340 --> 01:49:50.980]   the book of Daniel and try to understand it, and that helps kind of like your
[01:49:50.980 --> 01:49:56.100]   understanding of Revelation, right? So you have the language, you have, you have the
[01:49:56.100 --> 01:50:01.980]   Scripture by Scripture comparison, analogia Scriptura. It's just Scripture
[01:50:01.980 --> 01:50:05.780]   by Scripture, right? And then thirdly, what you will, what they will typically do is,
[01:50:05.780 --> 01:50:11.020]   if it's a good commentator, is how did the audience receive it at the time? So
[01:50:11.020 --> 01:50:15.140]   you go to culture, right? Like, like you and me, we say, "What's up, dog?" Like, we don't
[01:50:15.140 --> 01:50:19.580]   mean like an actual, like, poodle, right? We just say, like, "What's up, friend?" Right? So
[01:50:19.580 --> 01:50:22.860]   like, you know, like, look at the cult, like, you look at the culture, right? So a good
[01:50:22.860 --> 01:50:28.540]   commentator will do that, and then that's it. The commentators, what they speak
[01:50:28.540 --> 01:50:32.060]   is not from God, yeah. But they can, they can give you their insight, and that's,
[01:50:32.060 --> 01:50:38.460]   that's really it. It's the Holy Spirit in you that helps you to understand. Great
[01:50:38.460 --> 01:50:42.540]   question. That's a great question. Do you have a question?
[01:50:42.540 --> 01:50:53.820]   Yes. The 27 books in the New Testament is because it fulfilled the criterion that
[01:50:53.820 --> 01:50:58.900]   we went over, or the attributes that we went over. They had divine qualities. They
[01:50:58.900 --> 01:51:03.140]   had apostolic origins, and they had corporate reception. Those are the books,
[01:51:03.140 --> 01:51:07.540]   those are the books that have the doctrinal unity. Those are the books that
[01:51:07.540 --> 01:51:12.300]   have apostolic origins, right? All those books have apostolic origins. The five
[01:51:12.300 --> 01:51:15.700]   that were not directly penned by an apostle have close association with
[01:51:15.700 --> 01:51:21.140]   apostles, as if they were penned by an apostle, right? Thirdly, thirdly, they were
[01:51:21.140 --> 01:51:25.740]   received as such. As, those are the books that were received as such by the
[01:51:25.740 --> 01:51:29.540]   audience, right? So what that means is that if they were received by such as
[01:51:29.540 --> 01:51:33.900]   the audience of the apostles, they were received as such because the apostles
[01:51:33.900 --> 01:51:38.780]   told them, right? And Jesus said, "These are the guys that are going to tell you.
[01:51:38.780 --> 01:51:43.100]   These are the guys." Now you might say, "Well, well the apostles are sinful. The
[01:51:43.100 --> 01:51:47.980]   apostles could have gotten it wrong, right?" Yes, they're sinful. Yes, they're
[01:51:47.980 --> 01:51:53.540]   sinful, right? But when it comes to the canon of Scripture, you have to remember
[01:51:53.540 --> 01:51:59.540]   who God is, right? God said this was going to happen in this way. So if God said
[01:51:59.540 --> 01:52:03.260]   it's going to happen in this way, it's going to happen in this way, no matter
[01:52:03.260 --> 01:52:08.780]   how sinful I am, right? If God said, "James is gonna be the one to save all you guys,"
[01:52:08.780 --> 01:52:14.660]   and you guys are like, "Oh my gosh, why James? He's not that strong. He's old," right? But
[01:52:14.660 --> 01:52:21.020]   don't look at the man. Don't look at me. Look at the person who said it. God is
[01:52:21.020 --> 01:52:24.900]   the one who said, "I'm gonna save you guys." So it's not James is gonna save us, is
[01:52:24.900 --> 01:52:29.940]   God is the one saving us. James is just the instrument. So those are the books
[01:52:29.940 --> 01:52:33.820]   that fulfill all that criterion. Those are the books. There's no other books
[01:52:33.820 --> 01:52:37.180]   that fulfill that criterion.
[01:52:49.180 --> 01:52:53.820]   Correct. Lodiceans. Correct.
[01:52:53.820 --> 01:53:05.500]   The answer is yes. It did not fulfill the qualities that are being included. That
[01:53:05.500 --> 01:53:09.660]   letter is lost, okay? And the reason it was lost is because it was not a part of
[01:53:09.660 --> 01:53:13.060]   Scripture. And the reason it was not a part of Scripture, the reason it's not a
[01:53:13.060 --> 01:53:17.740]   part of Scripture is because there were many copies of it. When you look at one
[01:53:17.740 --> 01:53:21.500]   of the attributes of what was Scripture, when they knew it was Scripture, they
[01:53:21.500 --> 01:53:27.020]   were like, "OMG, this is Scripture. Everyone needs it. Make copies." That was
[01:53:27.020 --> 01:53:30.340]   what they did. That's just what they did. Like beginning with the Old Testament,
[01:53:30.340 --> 01:53:33.100]   it's not like we get to the New Testament, like there's this new practice,
[01:53:33.100 --> 01:53:37.980]   right? If it's God's Word, copy it accurately and copy a lot of it and give
[01:53:37.980 --> 01:53:42.580]   it to people. That's what they did. With that letter, it didn't happen. And
[01:53:42.580 --> 01:53:48.700]   there were other letters too. Didn't happen, right? So that's how we know.
[01:53:48.700 --> 01:53:51.700]   Mm-hmm.
[01:53:51.700 --> 01:54:06.260]   Mm-hmm.
[01:54:14.180 --> 01:54:21.260]   That all Scripture is God's Word and that it's also spoken by men? Is that...
[01:54:21.260 --> 01:54:28.420]   Okay. That's a good question. I mean, I would answer it like this. The idea of
[01:54:28.420 --> 01:54:33.140]   direct revelation is not new. It's not a new idea. When it comes to the New
[01:54:33.140 --> 01:54:36.460]   Testament, it's not like we got this new idea here, right? Prophets were already
[01:54:36.460 --> 01:54:41.220]   doing it. Isaiah said this, right? Jeremiah said this. Joel said this. So it's not
[01:54:41.220 --> 01:54:44.660]   like new. So when you get to the New Testament, it's not like, "Well, let's try
[01:54:44.660 --> 01:54:48.620]   this new idea of direct revelation." So that's not the case, right? It's already
[01:54:48.620 --> 01:54:53.060]   been done, right? Direct revelation has already been done, right? So Paul says,
[01:54:53.060 --> 01:54:57.580]   "We're ministers of the new covenant." So remember, the Old Covenant, right? You have
[01:54:57.580 --> 01:55:01.780]   redemption. We're free from Egypt. And then after we're free from Egypt, let me
[01:55:01.780 --> 01:55:04.940]   tell you about salvation. Let me tell you about what you're gonna do. Compilation
[01:55:04.940 --> 01:55:09.500]   of documents. Compilation of instructions. Same pattern in the New Testament. Paul
[01:55:09.500 --> 01:55:14.180]   says, "We're ministers of the new covenant." We're ministers of the new covenant, right?
[01:55:14.180 --> 01:55:18.200]   So then he gets direct revelation. Then he has to write the New Testament, and so
[01:55:18.200 --> 01:55:22.740]   do some of the other apostles, right? So this idea of direct revelation, I would
[01:55:22.740 --> 01:55:27.500]   say, kind of like the underpinning of it, the underpinning is that it is not a
[01:55:27.500 --> 01:55:32.580]   novel idea, right? Once you understand that it's not a novel idea, it really
[01:55:32.580 --> 01:55:36.660]   helps to accept the fact that it happened in the New Testament, right? You couple
[01:55:36.660 --> 01:55:41.820]   that with the fact that Jesus said this was going to happen. So it
[01:55:41.820 --> 01:55:47.660]   hinges on Christ. The canon hinges on Christ, right? Like our salvation, I mean,
[01:55:47.660 --> 01:55:52.020]   everything about our salvation hinges on Christ, so does the canon, right? And I am
[01:55:52.020 --> 01:55:57.020]   going to trust the guy who rose from the dead over the scholar over here, right?
[01:55:57.020 --> 01:56:00.540]   G.K. Chesterton said, "We need education to help us from the intellectual elite."
[01:56:00.540 --> 01:56:04.020]   Right? That's very interesting, right? Because you would think that the
[01:56:04.020 --> 01:56:07.660]   intellectual elite will give you truth, but we need education to guard ourselves
[01:56:07.660 --> 01:56:11.960]   from the intellectual elite, right? I look at Christ, he rose from the dead, he said
[01:56:11.960 --> 01:56:16.940]   this is gonna happen. It's not anything new. I'm completely fine with it. One other
[01:56:16.940 --> 01:56:22.300]   thing, well one other thing. I also look at the nature of God. If God said that he
[01:56:22.300 --> 01:56:28.380]   can make anything happen, that's despite sinful man. Despite sinful man, he can
[01:56:28.380 --> 01:56:33.580]   make anything happen. Can he form the New Testament canon? No problem. Easy peasy.
[01:56:33.580 --> 01:56:36.180]   Right?
[01:56:36.180 --> 01:56:51.540]   Well when you say exact, that could be a term of art, right? It is via the Holy
[01:56:51.540 --> 01:56:57.620]   Spirit. It's clear that they were cognizant when they were receiving
[01:56:57.620 --> 01:57:02.220]   tradition or when they were receiving direct revelation. They were
[01:57:02.220 --> 01:57:10.020]   apparently cognizant of that. So that's as exact as I think we can get to.
[01:57:10.020 --> 01:57:16.660]   That they knew and that it was via the Holy Spirit. Yeah. Great question. Great
[01:57:16.660 --> 01:57:18.940]   question.
[01:57:18.940 --> 01:57:30.740]   Tacitus. Tacitus describes Jesus and his miracles. The record of the Christian
[01:57:30.740 --> 01:57:37.300]   martyrs also. Because although no one took down their testimony, it is clear
[01:57:37.300 --> 01:57:40.860]   that they were killed because they were Christians. And it is clear that they
[01:57:40.860 --> 01:57:45.940]   wouldn't die if they denied their faith. Yet they died. So though speaking, they live.
[01:57:45.940 --> 01:57:50.260]   Though killed, they are conquerors.
[01:57:53.500 --> 01:58:02.940]   There's one other one. I forget. Lucian. Lucian.
[01:58:02.940 --> 01:58:10.340]   Anyone else? I love these questions. Yes.
[01:58:21.300 --> 01:58:28.900]   Great question. Great question. Holy Spirit. Holy Spirit. And the reason I know, the
[01:58:28.900 --> 01:58:36.300]   reason, one of the major reasons I know is my study of the Gospels.
[01:58:36.300 --> 01:58:44.980]   After I studied Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, like there is so much design. So
[01:58:44.980 --> 01:58:50.900]   much like just impeccable intentionality and design with each of the Gospels.
[01:58:50.900 --> 01:58:57.260]   Right? You could ask me this. You could ask me this, right? How do I know that
[01:58:57.260 --> 01:59:04.140]   that my my iPhone 11 Pro, this is iPhone 6, I'm just saying iPhone. My iPhone 11, how do I
[01:59:04.140 --> 01:59:07.540]   know that someone made this? How do I know that someone, how do I know that
[01:59:07.540 --> 01:59:11.740]   someone just didn't spill like a bunch of tools and then this just like popped
[01:59:11.740 --> 01:59:17.340]   up out of nowhere? Right? I'd be like, well let me see. I can load apps here. Like I,
[01:59:17.340 --> 01:59:22.180]   you know what I mean? I mean to tell you, right, when I study Matthew, Mark, Luke, and
[01:59:22.180 --> 01:59:31.460]   John, and I study the precision and the design in which each of the Gospels are
[01:59:31.460 --> 01:59:37.580]   written in their respective viewpoints, I see the mark of God. It just kind of
[01:59:37.580 --> 01:59:43.140]   like screams it in the same way Apple designed an iPhone. And like to me, in an
[01:59:43.140 --> 01:59:54.000]   even more, in an even more precise way. Yeah. So I would say firstly, Jesus said
[01:59:54.000 --> 01:59:59.500]   so in John 14 and John chapter 16. And secondarily, the divine qualities that I
[01:59:59.500 --> 02:00:02.820]   get from, that I see from studying the Scriptures. That that would be my answer
[02:00:02.820 --> 02:00:05.020]   to that.
[02:00:05.020 --> 02:00:12.020]   Great questions, by the way. Great questions. I want you to ask me these
[02:00:12.020 --> 02:00:16.660]   questions because I want everyone to leave here with like, God's Word is God's
[02:00:16.660 --> 02:00:21.260]   Word. And I, and if you have a question about something, I guarantee you someone
[02:00:21.260 --> 02:00:25.540]   else has a question. Don't be afraid of man. Don't be like, oh, like they're gonna
[02:00:25.540 --> 02:00:28.060]   think I'm a bad Christian. No one's gonna think you're a bad Christian, okay? If you
[02:00:28.060 --> 02:00:30.780]   don't ask me a question and you have a question, I'm gonna think you're a bad
[02:00:30.780 --> 02:00:36.100]   Christian. So just ask me that question. That's right.
[02:00:36.580 --> 02:00:41.980]   All right. Any other questions? Yes.
[02:00:41.980 --> 02:00:48.500]   Sorry, the non-apostle what?
[02:00:48.500 --> 02:00:57.620]   Okay, so yes. So Hebrew was thought to have Pauline authorship from a very early
[02:00:57.620 --> 02:01:02.580]   point on. Like, the general consensus is now we don't know for sure. Early on, it
[02:01:02.580 --> 02:01:05.580]   was thought to have Pauline authorship. So that takes that out. James was the
[02:01:05.580 --> 02:01:09.940]   brother of Jesus. So he was a leader, right? And when you think like apostles,
[02:01:09.940 --> 02:01:17.100]   when you think like, like it's not necessarily the people that were with
[02:01:17.100 --> 02:01:21.740]   Jesus. Like, James is the brother of Jesus, half-brother. So he was the recognized
[02:01:21.740 --> 02:01:25.580]   leader of Jerusalem from early on, right? So he wasn't necessarily with one of the
[02:01:25.580 --> 02:01:31.620]   twelve. But then he's, depending on how you define it, he fits a definition of a
[02:01:31.620 --> 02:01:39.660]   canonical apostle, okay? Mark was known as a son of Peter in 1st Peter 5. So, and
[02:01:39.660 --> 02:01:45.300]   even if you look at the Gospel of Mark, like, there's kind of this like Peter-like
[02:01:45.300 --> 02:01:50.020]   domination with respect to how he's portrayed and when he's portrayed that
[02:01:50.020 --> 02:01:54.540]   clearly showed his association with the apostle Peter, right? But other than that,
[02:01:54.540 --> 02:02:01.180]   1st Peter 5. I mean, he calls him his son, right? Mark, James. Oh, Jude is also a
[02:02:01.180 --> 02:02:09.940]   brother. Jude is also a brother. So it's Mark, James, Jude. Hebrews. What am I
[02:02:09.940 --> 02:02:12.460]   leaving out here?
[02:02:12.460 --> 02:02:25.700]   Oh, Luke. Sorry, yeah, Luke. I was like, what am I leaving out? Luke was known as a close
[02:02:25.700 --> 02:02:29.980]   traveling companion of Paul. That's, that's in Acts. That's, I think that's on your sheet, yeah.
[02:02:29.980 --> 02:02:40.980]   Colossians 4, 2nd Timothy 4, and Philemon. Yeah. So it's very well likely that, like,
[02:02:40.980 --> 02:02:44.980]   it doesn't have to be even that an apostle like sat there and he wrote it,
[02:02:44.980 --> 02:02:53.460]   right? Even like a Jeremiah, oh gosh, he was, was it Jeremiah Baruch, right? Yeah,
[02:02:53.460 --> 02:03:00.580]   Jeremiah Baruch, right? It wasn't necessarily that. I don't, I won't get this wrong.
[02:03:00.580 --> 02:03:05.380]   Was it Isaiah or Jeremiah? Jeremiah. It was Jeremiah. Yeah, it's Jeremiah. So it wasn't
[02:03:05.380 --> 02:03:09.100]   necessarily that, like, he had to have sat there and then penned it. Like, that, that,
[02:03:09.100 --> 02:03:12.380]   that's not necessarily what has to happen for, to have, like, an apostolic
[02:03:12.380 --> 02:03:15.460]   origin, right? Paul could have even dictated some of this stuff to Luke,
[02:03:15.460 --> 02:03:21.220]   right? Like, so, and so, like, this is, this is what happened. This is what I got
[02:03:21.220 --> 02:03:24.860]   received from the Lord. Could have easily had done that. That, that wouldn't have
[02:03:24.860 --> 02:03:31.380]   been too hard. So, and remember, Paul was a lay convert, but he received from the
[02:03:31.380 --> 02:03:36.020]   Lord Jesus. He received it in the same way that, like, Moses wasn't around for the
[02:03:36.020 --> 02:03:40.660]   creation of the world, but he received Genesis. Like, he wasn't there to witness,
[02:03:40.660 --> 02:03:44.340]   oh God, you're doing all this great stuff, and there's Adam, but he received it. He
[02:03:44.340 --> 02:03:47.500]   wrote about it because he received it from God, right? So you don't have to
[02:03:47.500 --> 02:03:51.660]   necessarily witness the event, right? You don't think this, you just need to be a
[02:03:51.660 --> 02:03:58.020]   part of, like, Jesus's direct, when John 14, and John chapter 14, and John chapter 16,
[02:03:58.020 --> 02:04:02.700]   you need to be a part of that group, right? And obviously, the other two that I
[02:04:02.700 --> 02:04:06.820]   mentioned, the divine qualities and the corporate reception, because his sheep
[02:04:06.820 --> 02:04:10.140]   hear his voice, right?
[02:04:10.140 --> 02:04:15.700]   Yes.
[02:04:15.700 --> 02:04:30.740]   [inaudible]
[02:04:30.740 --> 02:04:35.740]   Oh. Mm-hmm. [inaudible]
[02:04:35.740 --> 02:04:40.260]   [inaudible]
[02:04:40.260 --> 02:04:48.100]   Mm-hmm. I think you take them piece by piece. I think you take them piece by
[02:04:48.100 --> 02:04:53.780]   piece. So, if you want to talk about a tribe that was annihilated, the biblical
[02:04:53.780 --> 02:04:56.740]   definition of annihilated doesn't necessarily mean that every single one
[02:04:56.740 --> 02:05:00.260]   of its, every single one of the persons in the tribe is killed and murdered.
[02:05:00.260 --> 02:05:03.900]   That's not necessarily the case. Annihilation means, for all intensive
[02:05:03.900 --> 02:05:07.740]   purposes of being a people group, you are no longer a people group. That's, that's
[02:05:07.740 --> 02:05:11.300]   what annihilation means. So, you can still have, like, one dude, and then he can, like,
[02:05:11.300 --> 02:05:15.700]   he can still propagate his DNA into, like, you know, and find it, like, way later on.
[02:05:15.700 --> 02:05:22.980]   So, with respect to anything that's, like, a seeming inconsistency, like, that would
[02:05:22.980 --> 02:05:26.980]   be that example, and then depending on which other example that we're talking
[02:05:26.980 --> 02:05:34.580]   about, I would take it piece by piece. With respect to measurements or
[02:05:34.580 --> 02:05:39.540]   geographical regions or anything like that, there were a lot of
[02:05:39.540 --> 02:05:44.140]   things that, in certain points in history, that were thought to be a certain way,
[02:05:44.140 --> 02:05:48.580]   that turned out to be different later on, right? One example that I can think of
[02:05:48.580 --> 02:05:53.620]   that I don't remember the chapter in Psalms right now, but it's, he spins the
[02:05:53.620 --> 02:06:00.020]   earth on its, like, a wheel, like, I'll have to find it, right? But for a long
[02:06:00.020 --> 02:06:06.260]   time, science thought the earth was flat. I mean, that's just all of science, that
[02:06:06.260 --> 02:06:09.580]   the earth was flat, right? Psalms portrayed something differently, right?
[02:06:09.580 --> 02:06:16.060]   Now, later on, we learn that the earth is actually not flat, right? So, there are
[02:06:16.060 --> 02:06:19.380]   things like that I think the Bible has vindicated over time, that I think
[02:06:19.380 --> 02:06:24.140]   certain things that, when you look, like, at a static moment, oh, it seems like the
[02:06:24.140 --> 02:06:27.780]   Bible is incorrect, but later on, the Bible seems to outlive its pallbearers, so to
[02:06:27.780 --> 02:06:32.500]   speak, right? So, the Bible has a history of kind of doing that. So, my answer to
[02:06:32.500 --> 02:06:36.380]   that would be, depending on, like, what we're talking about, I would tackle it
[02:06:36.380 --> 02:06:42.260]   differently. I, you know, it just depends on what we're talking about, so, yeah.
[02:06:42.260 --> 02:07:00.260]   [inaudible]
[02:07:00.260 --> 02:07:06.780]   You know, I actually would, and I actually would, because there is a communion of
[02:07:06.780 --> 02:07:11.060]   consciousness, and I'm not saying it's, like, the greatest factor, but I
[02:07:11.060 --> 02:07:16.140]   definitely think it's a good factor that, throughout time, the saints have seen
[02:07:16.140 --> 02:07:23.500]   these books as the authoritative Word of God, and if His sheep hear His voice, then
[02:07:23.500 --> 02:07:28.300]   having a communion of consciousness is consistent with Jesus saying, "My sheep
[02:07:28.300 --> 02:07:33.220]   hear my voice." So, yes, I would say that that is a great witness to the 27 books
[02:07:33.220 --> 02:07:39.740]   that we have. Great, great witness. Sure.
[02:07:39.740 --> 02:07:47.740]   [inaudible]
[02:07:47.740 --> 02:07:54.740]   Not primarily. Not primarily. Correct, correct.
[02:07:54.740 --> 02:07:57.740]   [inaudible]
[02:07:57.740 --> 02:08:02.340]   Great question. That's a great question. Whenever you get to a passage,
[02:08:02.340 --> 02:08:07.020]   whenever you get to a passage, right, one of the first things that you need to do
[02:08:07.020 --> 02:08:12.820]   is you need to understand what Jesus is actually saying to the hearer, or the
[02:08:12.820 --> 02:08:17.740]   author's, like, what is actually being told to the hearer, right, first, before you
[02:08:17.740 --> 02:08:20.900]   pluck yourself in the situation, right? Because if you pluck yourself in the
[02:08:20.900 --> 02:08:25.820]   situation, right, it's not gonna make the, you're not interpreting it
[02:08:25.820 --> 02:08:31.580]   correctly, right? So, before we understand something individually, the
[02:08:31.580 --> 02:08:36.860]   first thing that we need to understand is what is being said objectively? What is
[02:08:36.860 --> 02:08:42.620]   being said objectively? And objectively, Jesus is speaking to his dudes, I mean,
[02:08:42.620 --> 02:08:47.980]   his men, right, and he's saying, "Look, Holy Spirit's gonna come. The better I go.
[02:08:47.980 --> 02:08:51.380]   Holy Spirit's gonna come. He's gonna teach you all things. He's gonna guide you into
[02:08:51.380 --> 02:08:54.380]   all things. He's gonna teach you all truth." That is the first thing that he's
[02:08:54.380 --> 02:09:01.620]   saying to his men, right? And so, that is the first interpretation. That is, that is
[02:09:01.620 --> 02:09:04.660]   the first thing that we need to glean off, because that is the primary thing
[02:09:04.660 --> 02:09:10.180]   that he's saying, right? After that, after that, there are other verses that speak
[02:09:10.180 --> 02:09:15.760]   about us having the mind of Christ, us understanding all truth, us having this
[02:09:15.760 --> 02:09:19.580]   light. Like, there's passages then that refer to us. So, I look at those
[02:09:19.580 --> 02:09:23.620]   passages that refer to the individual, then when I look back at John chapter 14
[02:09:23.620 --> 02:09:29.060]   and John chapter 16, ah, okay, I can see what he means. The Holy Spirit's gonna
[02:09:29.060 --> 02:09:33.380]   behave this way with his men. It's gonna behave in a similar way with me, right?
[02:09:33.380 --> 02:09:40.020]   But I look also at Jude, who says, "The faith was once for all delivered to the
[02:09:40.020 --> 02:09:44.540]   saints." It's already delivered to the saints. It's already delivered, right? How
[02:09:44.540 --> 02:09:48.380]   does the Holy Spirit behave with me? He doesn't write the New Testament with me.
[02:09:48.380 --> 02:09:54.460]   He wrote it with them. He wrote it with me. So, yeah, great question. That's a
[02:09:54.460 --> 02:09:59.540]   great question. Again, we're analogia scriptura, right? Scripture upon
[02:09:59.540 --> 02:10:03.580]   scripture upon scripture, right? Yes.
[02:10:03.580 --> 02:10:27.500]   Mm-hmm.
[02:10:28.500 --> 02:10:37.020]   Um, yeah. Yeah. So, I'm not gonna say that it's like the devil himself, because the
[02:10:37.020 --> 02:10:43.140]   devil is not, he can't be everywhere at once, right? But is it his influence? Is
[02:10:43.140 --> 02:10:50.980]   it his influence? Yeah, because sin works best because it seems sublime. It seems
[02:10:50.980 --> 02:10:56.860]   morally pure. Sin seems morally pure, right? If the devil appeared to you and
[02:10:56.860 --> 02:11:00.660]   me, like in a pitchfork, like with horns and with like a tail, it's like, "Dude, yeah,
[02:11:00.660 --> 02:11:05.100]   I'm not gonna follow anything you say," right? But if it appears as an angel of
[02:11:05.100 --> 02:11:09.940]   light, okay, then I might believe you. I might actually, because you, you, you, you
[02:11:09.940 --> 02:11:14.300]   looked the part. You looked the part, right? And that's why I go back. That's
[02:11:14.300 --> 02:11:22.040]   why I go back. Subjective experience is not the final criterion for what's the
[02:11:22.040 --> 02:11:28.000]   canon, see? Your friend, he's not stating it in this way, but what he's saying is,
[02:11:28.000 --> 02:11:33.540]   subjectively, because I feel this way, it must be the Word of God. That's what he's
[02:11:33.540 --> 02:11:36.980]   saying. He's not, again, he's not articulating it that way, but that is
[02:11:36.980 --> 02:11:42.820]   essentially what he's saying. The Word of God impresses itself upon its believers,
[02:11:42.820 --> 02:11:47.700]   right? And you know the Word of God is the Word of God when you go back to
[02:11:47.700 --> 02:11:53.380]   Christ. You go back to the person of Christ, right? He never said that Joseph
[02:11:53.380 --> 02:11:58.260]   Smith was gonna write New Testament. Never said that. Search all of his words.
[02:11:58.260 --> 02:12:03.220]   He never said, you know, 1,600 years later or whatever it is, there's gonna be some
[02:12:03.220 --> 02:12:07.780]   dude in like the Zion area that's gonna, I'm gonna give him like more, no, he
[02:12:07.780 --> 02:12:13.380]   never said that, right? In fact, Jude says the opposite. It was once for all
[02:12:13.380 --> 02:12:19.820]   delivered to the saints. So what, like you and I can feel one way, but what matters
[02:12:19.820 --> 02:12:23.500]   is how does God feel? I mean, there are times in my life before I was a Christian
[02:12:23.500 --> 02:12:26.740]   where I thought certain things were okay. I don't think they're okay anymore, right?
[02:12:26.740 --> 02:12:32.660]   Same, I would like, it's, it's a matter of objectivity as opposed to subjectivity.
[02:12:32.660 --> 02:12:40.820]   Yeah, a matter of, quite frankly, a matter of reason versus a matter of emotion.
[02:12:40.820 --> 02:12:43.820]   Yes.
[02:13:08.740 --> 02:13:14.940]   That's a great question. That's a great question. I can't deny someone's feelings,
[02:13:14.940 --> 02:13:19.660]   right? So if someone were to argue with me and say, "Well, I feel this way," right? I
[02:13:19.660 --> 02:13:25.220]   can't deny your feelings, right? But I would ask that person, I would ask that
[02:13:25.220 --> 02:13:30.860]   person, given that you feel the way that you do, given that you, are there people
[02:13:30.860 --> 02:13:33.820]   in the world, not you, I'm not talking about you, this is what I would say to
[02:13:33.820 --> 02:13:37.060]   the Mormon, I'm not talking about you because you, you, you're from God and you
[02:13:37.060 --> 02:13:41.140]   got it, I get it, but are there people in this world who are deceived? Yes. He would
[02:13:41.140 --> 02:13:45.580]   say yes, right? Okay. Are there people in this world who are deceived but who
[02:13:45.580 --> 02:13:50.260]   don't think they are deceived? Answer would be yes, right? And do those people
[02:13:50.260 --> 02:13:54.180]   think I could never be deceived? There are people who think that, like, other
[02:13:54.180 --> 02:14:00.020]   people are deceived but not me, right? The Mormon guy would say yes, right? Okay. So
[02:14:00.020 --> 02:14:03.660]   he, other people are deceived but I'm not deceived, okay. But it's not you, right? No, no,
[02:14:03.660 --> 02:14:09.380]   it's not me, it's not me, okay. How do you know that? Well, because I feel this way. But
[02:14:09.380 --> 02:14:13.100]   this guy feels that way, right? This guy feels that way. This girl feels that way,
[02:14:13.100 --> 02:14:20.540]   right? Okay, okay. So then how do we know? How do we know? You say two things, say
[02:14:20.540 --> 02:14:25.380]   two things, or generally two things. We don't know, then, okay, that's pretty
[02:14:25.380 --> 02:14:30.260]   hopeless, right? We just can't know? Like, it doesn't sound like God to me. The God
[02:14:30.260 --> 02:14:34.520]   I know sounds like he would want his children to know. So this is a new God
[02:14:34.520 --> 02:14:37.260]   that you're preaching, so I, you know, like, if he says we don't know, then
[02:14:37.260 --> 02:14:41.740]   that's, that's, that's, okay, we don't know, right? The other thing he would say, the
[02:14:41.740 --> 02:14:45.700]   other thing that he would say is he would appeal to someone. We know because
[02:14:45.700 --> 02:14:51.220]   some higher authority. Oh, we know because of some higher authority. Who is your
[02:14:51.220 --> 02:14:57.260]   higher authority? Joseph Smith? Who is he gonna say? Jesus? And then this
[02:14:57.260 --> 02:15:00.680]   applies to anyone. Buddha? Like, who is your higher authority, right? If he says
[02:15:00.680 --> 02:15:06.300]   Jesus, then I go down, I go down like history, right? If he says Jesus, right? If
[02:15:06.300 --> 02:15:10.900]   he says Joseph Smith, okay, you believe in Joseph Smith, what can I do? Like,
[02:15:10.900 --> 02:15:16.100]   that's, that's fundamental to you, right? I believe in Jesus. Joseph Smith didn't
[02:15:16.100 --> 02:15:19.220]   rise from the dead. He's dead, isn't he? He's dead, yeah. Did he make anyone else
[02:15:19.220 --> 02:15:22.900]   rise from the dead? No. Okay. I mean, I don't know what to tell you, bro, like,
[02:15:22.900 --> 02:15:26.140]   Jesus rose from the dead, so I'm gonna, I'm gonna go with Jesus. I don't know, I'm
[02:15:26.140 --> 02:15:30.140]   gonna go with the guy that rose from the dead, so, I mean, it really hinges upon
[02:15:30.140 --> 02:15:35.260]   that. It really does hinge upon the person of Christ. Yeah. That's how, I would
[02:15:35.260 --> 02:15:44.700]   roughly go about in that way. I would bring it back to Jesus. Great questions.
[02:15:44.700 --> 02:15:54.420]   If you think of a question, you know where I go to church. Thank you, guys.
[02:15:54.420 --> 02:15:57.420]   Thank you very much.
