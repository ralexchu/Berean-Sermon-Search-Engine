[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:28.640]   [ Background noise ]
[00:00:29.140 --> 00:00:36.180]   >> All right, let's, let me pray for us and then we'll go
[00:00:36.180 --> 00:00:37.120]   into the teaching time.
[00:00:37.120 --> 00:00:42.940]   Lord, would you help us to understand your truths well
[00:00:42.940 --> 00:00:47.360]   and to apply them appropriately in our lives
[00:00:47.360 --> 00:00:52.480]   so that every single one of us really would be able to exhort
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:57.540]   and reprove for the purposes of the building up of your church.
[00:00:58.300 --> 00:00:59.900]   We thank you for our discussion.
[00:00:59.900 --> 00:01:02.540]   We pray that you would help us to have a fruitful time
[00:01:02.540 --> 00:01:05.520]   of gleaning and learning over the next few minutes
[00:01:05.520 --> 00:01:06.260]   and Jesus, let me pray.
[00:01:06.260 --> 00:01:12.800]   So I read this in the beginning and I'll take this passage
[00:01:12.800 --> 00:01:16.920]   and I'll further just carve it up, okay?
[00:01:16.920 --> 00:01:22.940]   So if you've noticed, I've categorized verses five
[00:01:22.940 --> 00:01:27.980]   and six as more private life and then seven to nine as kind
[00:01:27.980 --> 00:01:30.180]   of the publicly measurable stuff there.
[00:01:30.180 --> 00:01:35.780]   And in the middle, that for, it's a Greek word, gar.
[00:01:35.780 --> 00:01:38.060]   It's a very important word, right?
[00:01:38.060 --> 00:01:40.360]   The for is a very, kind of a vague word
[00:01:40.360 --> 00:01:41.540]   but it's a very important word.
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:45.200]   And it tells me right away that an elder
[00:01:45.200 --> 00:01:47.860]   and an overseer are the same thing, okay?
[00:01:47.860 --> 00:01:52.220]   For, this kind of a person is supposed to do A, B, C, and D,
[00:01:52.220 --> 00:01:57.540]   okay? And so I blew up that little phrase,
[00:01:57.540 --> 00:02:00.080]   for the overseer must be above approach,
[00:02:00.080 --> 00:02:02.060]   and I blew up the bottom.
[00:02:02.060 --> 00:02:04.680]   Why must he be above approach?
[00:02:04.680 --> 00:02:08.440]   So that he will be able both to exhort in sound doctrine
[00:02:08.440 --> 00:02:09.740]   and refute those who contradict.
[00:02:09.740 --> 00:02:14.280]   So basically, if you're ministering in the flesh
[00:02:14.280 --> 00:02:16.600]   and if your character is severely flawed,
[00:02:16.600 --> 00:02:18.660]   you're going to corrupt everything you teach.
[00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:19.840]   You're going to get in your own way.
[00:02:19.840 --> 00:02:23.420]   You're going to hinder the message not only
[00:02:23.420 --> 00:02:24.860]   by teaching incorrect things
[00:02:24.860 --> 00:02:28.140]   but by practicing it inappropriately, right?
[00:02:28.140 --> 00:02:29.980]   So that's the thing.
[00:02:29.980 --> 00:02:31.980]   So for me, when I look at this,
[00:02:31.980 --> 00:02:35.360]   the holding fast isn't the part that hinges upon
[00:02:35.360 --> 00:02:36.560]   so that he may be able to teach.
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:39.560]   It's the, he must be above approach
[00:02:39.560 --> 00:02:43.600]   so that he will be able to exhort and reprove, okay?
[00:02:43.600 --> 00:02:47.480]   So that's visually and grammatically, I dug deeper
[00:02:47.480 --> 00:02:49.700]   but just visually I see it like that.
[00:02:49.700 --> 00:02:53.200]   And I have five negative traits there.
[00:02:54.600 --> 00:02:56.900]   And it's interesting, I just immediately thought like,
[00:02:56.900 --> 00:02:59.200]   oh, these are five ways that leaders,
[00:02:59.200 --> 00:03:01.480]   especially as they become more successful, become tempted.
[00:03:01.480 --> 00:03:06.420]   Okay? The woman one was covered already
[00:03:06.420 --> 00:03:07.580]   in the one woman man thing.
[00:03:07.580 --> 00:03:11.240]   But these are ways that this leader can be easily tempted.
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:16.480]   As the church grows, this leader might have his own agenda.
[00:03:16.480 --> 00:03:20.580]   As the church grows and there's people who cause problems,
[00:03:20.580 --> 00:03:23.500]   we might lose patience and be like, let's squash that.
[00:03:23.500 --> 00:03:25.740]   Let's expunge that because that's what God wants us to do
[00:03:25.740 --> 00:03:27.320]   from the church and be very quick.
[00:03:27.320 --> 00:03:32.240]   There's also a temptation to just get my mind off
[00:03:32.240 --> 00:03:35.680]   of the busyness of ministry and just indulge in things
[00:03:35.680 --> 00:03:39.160]   that are not of God, whatever it is.
[00:03:39.160 --> 00:03:42.560]   Pugnacious, if someone challenges me
[00:03:42.560 --> 00:03:44.600]   and attacks my character, I might want to fight.
[00:03:44.600 --> 00:03:49.360]   I might be tempted to be kinder to people
[00:03:49.360 --> 00:03:51.660]   who give more money to the church.
[00:03:51.660 --> 00:03:53.260]   So these are ways that I can be tempted.
[00:03:53.640 --> 00:03:55.180]   And then there's that but in there
[00:03:55.180 --> 00:03:56.860]   and that there's six positive traits.
[00:03:56.860 --> 00:03:59.240]   And if you guys have thought it was seven, okay,
[00:03:59.240 --> 00:04:00.740]   it's actually six.
[00:04:00.740 --> 00:04:03.480]   There are six adjectives and one adverb.
[00:04:03.480 --> 00:04:06.260]   Hopefully you guys can visually see this.
[00:04:06.260 --> 00:04:09.540]   The six adjectives or virtues are all good
[00:04:09.540 --> 00:04:13.580]   and that holding is not an adjective.
[00:04:13.580 --> 00:04:15.320]   It's an adverb.
[00:04:15.320 --> 00:04:18.300]   If you look at the Greek, it's adjective, adjective, adjective,
[00:04:18.300 --> 00:04:20.500]   adjective, adverb, okay?
[00:04:20.500 --> 00:04:22.640]   So that's how I get this, okay,
[00:04:22.640 --> 00:04:24.200]   above approach, why?
[00:04:24.200 --> 00:04:26.060]   So that he can teach effectively
[00:04:26.060 --> 00:04:28.020]   and not get in in his own way, all right?
[00:04:28.020 --> 00:04:29.160]   So that's the first thing that I've done.
[00:04:29.160 --> 00:04:32.640]   Now, some of you guys might have discussed this.
[00:04:32.640 --> 00:04:35.860]   It's like, well, is elder and overseer the same thing?
[00:04:35.860 --> 00:04:38.140]   What's a bishop, right?
[00:04:38.140 --> 00:04:39.500]   We don't use the word bishop.
[00:04:39.500 --> 00:04:41.900]   But my friend who's also Korean,
[00:04:41.900 --> 00:04:43.620]   when she was in her youth group,
[00:04:43.620 --> 00:04:47.060]   her dad was a bishop at their church, okay?
[00:04:47.060 --> 00:04:48.140]   I thought that was so strange.
[00:04:48.140 --> 00:04:48.980]   I was like, what's a bishop?
[00:04:48.980 --> 00:04:51.900]   But that's what she called her dad, okay?
[00:04:52.380 --> 00:04:56.400]   So is overseer synonymous to elder?
[00:04:56.400 --> 00:05:00.040]   The internal structure told me yes.
[00:05:00.040 --> 00:05:02.060]   But here, I'm going to go a little bit further just
[00:05:02.060 --> 00:05:03.220]   for your edification.
[00:05:03.220 --> 00:05:06.800]   The word elder is presbuteros,
[00:05:06.800 --> 00:05:09.440]   which is actually the most frequently used term
[00:05:09.440 --> 00:05:10.460]   for a spiritual leader.
[00:05:10.460 --> 00:05:13.420]   Overseer and bishop are the same word.
[00:05:13.420 --> 00:05:14.760]   It's episkopos.
[00:05:14.760 --> 00:05:17.660]   And if you guys think, oh, it's Episcopalian church,
[00:05:17.660 --> 00:05:19.760]   they have bishops, okay?
[00:05:19.760 --> 00:05:20.980]   So overseer, bishop.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:23.580]   It's used a lot less frequently.
[00:05:23.580 --> 00:05:26.460]   And then you have shepherd, pastor.
[00:05:26.460 --> 00:05:29.820]   It's usually used in the verb form, not the noun form.
[00:05:29.820 --> 00:05:33.300]   Okay, you're shepherding, you're pastoring, okay?
[00:05:33.300 --> 00:05:35.740]   It's only used once in the noun form.
[00:05:35.740 --> 00:05:38.800]   And that's the Greek word poimen, all right?
[00:05:38.800 --> 00:05:41.940]   So presbuteros, episkopos, poimen,
[00:05:41.940 --> 00:05:45.480]   and these are all things that pop up as church leader,
[00:05:45.480 --> 00:05:46.300]   all right?
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:48.600]   A deacon is not a leadership position.
[00:05:48.600 --> 00:05:50.940]   It's an aid position.
[00:05:51.720 --> 00:05:53.220]   Now, oh, so many guys are busy writing.
[00:05:53.220 --> 00:05:54.840]   I'm going to make all of these slides available
[00:05:54.840 --> 00:05:57.340]   so you don't need to scramble, okay?
[00:05:57.340 --> 00:05:59.300]   Now, these are the one in the --
[00:05:59.300 --> 00:06:01.640]   these are one in the same New Testament office.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:04.980]   And I'm just going to read two verses out of Acts
[00:06:04.980 --> 00:06:08.120]   that will show you where it's all used, okay?
[00:06:08.120 --> 00:06:12.820]   From Miletus, he sent to Ephesus and -- this is Paul --
[00:06:12.820 --> 00:06:18.460]   and call to him the presbuteroi of the church, the elders.
[00:06:19.680 --> 00:06:22.300]   And then he has instructions, and in verse 28,
[00:06:22.300 --> 00:06:26.980]   "Be on guard for yourselves and for all the flock among
[00:06:26.980 --> 00:06:31.280]   which the Holy Spirit has made you episkopoi," bishops,
[00:06:31.280 --> 00:06:37.420]   overseers, "to shepherd poimen," the church of God,
[00:06:37.420 --> 00:06:39.140]   which he purchased with his own blood.
[00:06:39.140 --> 00:06:41.380]   So if you're like, "Well, what's all the difference?
[00:06:41.380 --> 00:06:43.940]   How come our church has elders and we don't have overseers?
[00:06:43.940 --> 00:06:46.040]   How come our church has elders and pastors?"
[00:06:46.780 --> 00:06:49.800]   It's -- the lines are fuzzy in modern-day practice
[00:06:49.800 --> 00:06:51.640]   and application, but in the Greek,
[00:06:51.640 --> 00:06:52.720]   it all means the same thing.
[00:06:52.720 --> 00:06:57.040]   So what you expect of me should be expected of the elder,
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:06:59.440]   should be expected of the small group leader,
[00:06:59.440 --> 00:07:02.820]   possibly to a lesser degree, expected of every Christian,
[00:07:02.820 --> 00:07:06.000]   because these are exemplary things, okay?
[00:07:06.000 --> 00:07:10.160]   Hopefully, that clears up some stuff.
[00:07:10.160 --> 00:07:13.080]   And I'm going to just talk about a couple more things
[00:07:13.080 --> 00:07:15.760]   that I found are very significant.
[00:07:16.020 --> 00:07:19.520]   This holding fast, remember, it's not the seventh adjective
[00:07:19.520 --> 00:07:23.080]   or virtue, it's actually a hinge word, okay?
[00:07:23.080 --> 00:07:27.580]   So it literally means holding fast, holding firm,
[00:07:27.580 --> 00:07:29.940]   cleaving to, loyally tending to,
[00:07:29.940 --> 00:07:33.000]   and this is a very important word, because this is --
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:36.820]   this man of God who does all of these things,
[00:07:36.820 --> 00:07:39.920]   husband of one wife, having children who are faithful,
[00:07:39.920 --> 00:07:42.840]   believe, right, self-controlled, loving what is good, hospitable,
[00:07:42.840 --> 00:07:45.080]   just, devout, loving, all of those things,
[00:07:45.960 --> 00:07:49.700]   holding to the faithful word.
[00:07:49.700 --> 00:07:52.800]   So this is actually a very important hinge word, okay?
[00:07:52.800 --> 00:07:55.100]   And when I get to a word I feel
[00:07:55.100 --> 00:07:57.920]   like is extremely important, I might do a word study.
[00:07:57.920 --> 00:08:03.620]   I will compare translations, I will compare usages
[00:08:03.620 --> 00:08:06.620]   of that Greek word in other verses or passages,
[00:08:06.620 --> 00:08:08.780]   and I will just do a basic word study
[00:08:08.780 --> 00:08:10.680]   to whatever I can benefit from,
[00:08:10.680 --> 00:08:13.600]   so I can understand the mood of this word.
[00:08:14.860 --> 00:08:19.400]   If I, as a pastor, am supposed to hold fast to this thing,
[00:08:19.400 --> 00:08:24.160]   how strong is that word, and how fiercely am I supposed
[00:08:24.160 --> 00:08:26.320]   to hold on to this faithful teaching, okay?
[00:08:26.320 --> 00:08:30.800]   So I'm going to -- so I do a little bit of a --
[00:08:30.800 --> 00:08:36.420]   it's hard to see from there, but I will look at all the ways
[00:08:36.420 --> 00:08:39.000]   that it's used, I will look at all the different translations,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:41.420]   and then I'm going to notice that it's only used
[00:08:41.420 --> 00:08:43.740]   in four times in all the New Testament.
[00:08:43.760 --> 00:08:49.720]   Okay, the word is antecho, all right?
[00:08:49.720 --> 00:08:53.320]   Antecho, so how is this used?
[00:08:53.320 --> 00:08:57.260]   Matthew 624, no one can serve two masters,
[00:08:57.260 --> 00:09:01.180]   for either he will hate the one and love the other,
[00:09:01.180 --> 00:09:05.800]   or he will be antecho to the one and despise the other.
[00:09:05.800 --> 00:09:09.460]   You cannot serve God in money, possessions.
[00:09:09.460 --> 00:09:11.840]   That's a pretty strong word then, right?
[00:09:12.940 --> 00:09:15.060]   You either love God or you hate him.
[00:09:15.060 --> 00:09:20.060]   So this holding fast, antecho, is a very, very strong word.
[00:09:20.060 --> 00:09:23.340]   I need to hold on to this thing
[00:09:23.340 --> 00:09:27.400]   as if this is my only obsession in life,
[00:09:27.400 --> 00:09:28.760]   for which I will be judged.
[00:09:28.760 --> 00:09:31.400]   So this is a very strong word.
[00:09:31.400 --> 00:09:32.560]   Luke has the same.
[00:09:32.560 --> 00:09:35.200]   First Thessalonians, now we appeal to you, brothers,
[00:09:35.200 --> 00:09:39.180]   admonish the disorderly, comfort the discouraged,
[00:09:39.520 --> 00:09:44.900]   and antechesthe the weak, cleave yourself to them
[00:09:44.900 --> 00:09:49.380]   and do not leave their side so that they can be helped.
[00:09:49.380 --> 00:09:52.040]   And then Titus.
[00:09:52.040 --> 00:09:56.220]   So is this a strong word just from this word study?
[00:09:56.220 --> 00:09:57.260]   Oh, yeah, it's a very strong word.
[00:09:57.260 --> 00:10:02.160]   So this holding fast, the faithful word,
[00:10:02.160 --> 00:10:03.900]   which is in accordance with the teaching then,
[00:10:03.900 --> 00:10:06.540]   is a very strong statement that I'm going
[00:10:06.540 --> 00:10:09.060]   to have to pay attention to, all right?
[00:10:09.580 --> 00:10:14.540]   As a church leader, there are many voices in this world,
[00:10:14.540 --> 00:10:17.900]   on Facebook, in the media, telling me
[00:10:17.900 --> 00:10:20.720]   as a church leader I have many jobs.
[00:10:20.720 --> 00:10:23.680]   I need to be a social justice advocate.
[00:10:23.680 --> 00:10:26.460]   I need to help the poor.
[00:10:26.460 --> 00:10:30.360]   I need to be the first to speak out against racial issues.
[00:10:30.360 --> 00:10:33.960]   I need to be a resource for political agendas.
[00:10:33.960 --> 00:10:36.260]   I need to do all these things.
[00:10:36.260 --> 00:10:40.440]   I need to be well-read in all the theological things.
[00:10:40.440 --> 00:10:43.560]   I need to be an expert in all of these things.
[00:10:43.560 --> 00:10:47.600]   There are many voices that are around Christendom
[00:10:47.600 --> 00:10:49.640]   that are telling church leaders that they need
[00:10:49.640 --> 00:10:50.720]   to do certain things.
[00:10:50.720 --> 00:10:51.920]   Would you guys agree?
[00:10:51.920 --> 00:10:55.640]   But what is the one thing that I'm supposed
[00:10:55.640 --> 00:10:58.200]   to cleave myself towards or to --
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:10:59.560]   so that like my life depended on it?
[00:10:59.560 --> 00:11:02.120]   It's this, okay?
[00:11:03.160 --> 00:11:06.380]   So this isn't just another virtue in a list of virtues.
[00:11:06.380 --> 00:11:11.100]   This is something that I need to devote myself to doing.
[00:11:11.100 --> 00:11:12.560]   Here we go.
[00:11:12.560 --> 00:11:18.100]   Holding fast the faithful word which is in accordance
[00:11:18.100 --> 00:11:22.540]   with the teaching so that he will be able both to exhort
[00:11:22.540 --> 00:11:29.380]   in sound doctrine and refute those who contradict.
[00:11:30.460 --> 00:11:34.720]   And this is actually the only action test.
[00:11:34.720 --> 00:11:37.040]   Everything else is a character, right?
[00:11:37.040 --> 00:11:42.040]   But this is something that the leader needs to visibly
[00:11:42.040 --> 00:11:45.660]   and measurably be held accountable to, okay?
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:50.200]   So the conclusion that I draw from this is one
[00:11:50.200 --> 00:11:52.780]   of the primary aims of every Christian
[00:11:52.780 --> 00:11:57.560]   and especially the chief duty of those who lead the church.
[00:11:57.560 --> 00:11:59.080]   What is it?
[00:11:59.300 --> 00:12:03.460]   This verse might give me an insight into that.
[00:12:03.460 --> 00:12:13.540]   My job as a representative of God, as a mouthpiece
[00:12:13.540 --> 00:12:19.040]   for the creator of the universe, the faithful teaching
[00:12:19.040 --> 00:12:22.980]   of his word, the faithful dispensation of his word needs
[00:12:22.980 --> 00:12:25.440]   to be an obsession on my end.
[00:12:25.440 --> 00:12:27.600]   Matthew 28, 18 to 20.
[00:12:27.600 --> 00:12:28.540]   You guys know this verse.
[00:12:29.140 --> 00:12:31.340]   Right? All authority in heaven and earth have been given to me.
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:33.680]   Go and make disciples of all nations, baptizing them in the name
[00:12:33.680 --> 00:12:34.920]   of the father and the son of the holy spirit.
[00:12:34.920 --> 00:12:41.300]   Teaching them to do everything that I commanded you.
[00:12:41.300 --> 00:12:43.740]   How long will it take for me to teach you everything
[00:12:43.740 --> 00:12:44.720]   that Jesus taught you to do?
[00:12:44.720 --> 00:12:46.080]   A long time.
[00:12:46.080 --> 00:12:49.980]   I can't waste my time focusing on many other things.
[00:12:49.980 --> 00:12:56.120]   My primary thing has to be teaching every Berean to do,
[00:12:56.120 --> 00:12:59.780]   not just to know, but to do everything that I commanded you.
[00:12:59.780 --> 00:13:01.260]   That's part of the great commission.
[00:13:01.260 --> 00:13:02.540]   John 14, 15.
[00:13:02.540 --> 00:13:03.940]   If you love me, you will what?
[00:13:03.940 --> 00:13:05.920]   Obey what I command.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:07.220]   How do you know you're loving the Lord?
[00:13:07.220 --> 00:13:09.300]   Well, let me teach you.
[00:13:09.300 --> 00:13:11.520]   Let me walk you through what God desires.
[00:13:11.520 --> 00:13:13.460]   First Timothy 4, 16.
[00:13:13.460 --> 00:13:16.120]   Watch your life and doctrine very closely, and I'm going to go
[00:13:16.120 --> 00:13:18.900]   to that verse later, second Timothy 3, 16 to 17.
[00:13:18.900 --> 00:13:20.740]   All scripture is God-breathed.
[00:13:20.740 --> 00:13:25.040]   Right? And it's useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting,
[00:13:25.040 --> 00:13:27.120]   and training in righteousness so that you may be equipped
[00:13:27.120 --> 00:13:29.380]   for every good work for salvation.
[00:13:29.380 --> 00:13:31.440]   Second Timothy 4, 2 to 3.
[00:13:31.440 --> 00:13:32.400]   Preach the word.
[00:13:32.400 --> 00:13:38.540]   So this holding fast is a very strong word, which the pastors
[00:13:38.540 --> 00:13:43.200]   at the church, elders too, are --
[00:13:43.200 --> 00:13:47.860]   that has to be one of our primary aims to guard the pulpit,
[00:13:47.860 --> 00:13:50.040]   to make sure the sheep are being fed.
[00:13:50.040 --> 00:13:53.080]   You guys following this?
[00:13:53.080 --> 00:13:55.020]   Okay. So the world --
[00:13:55.020 --> 00:13:57.640]   and the culture around us does not dictate what we teach.
[00:13:57.640 --> 00:14:00.440]   Obviously, if we're teaching everything correctly,
[00:14:00.440 --> 00:14:02.360]   it will address a lot of things.
[00:14:02.360 --> 00:14:06.840]   Right? Not perfectly, but it will address a lot of things,
[00:14:06.840 --> 00:14:08.540]   and where there are things that are great,
[00:14:08.540 --> 00:14:09.560]   it will give us wisdom.
[00:14:09.560 --> 00:14:14.260]   Okay? So that's the chief aim, primary aim of every Christian
[00:14:14.260 --> 00:14:17.380]   to know God and to make him known through his word,
[00:14:17.380 --> 00:14:19.760]   and especially for those who are in the front.
[00:14:19.760 --> 00:14:24.920]   We need to be biblically literate, astute,
[00:14:24.920 --> 00:14:26.520]   and passionate for this.
[00:14:26.520 --> 00:14:30.180]   So you guys hold our feet to the fire.
[00:14:30.180 --> 00:14:31.080]   All right?
[00:14:31.080 --> 00:14:33.240]   So what is this next thing?
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.700]   The faithful word, which is in accordance with the teaching.
[00:14:36.700 --> 00:14:39.600]   What is that?
[00:14:39.600 --> 00:14:44.860]   Is it like just the Old Testament?
[00:14:44.860 --> 00:14:47.660]   Well, if that's the case, wouldn't those
[00:14:47.660 --> 00:14:49.940]   of the circumcision say that they were the ones holding fast
[00:14:49.940 --> 00:14:51.100]   to the faithful word, which is in accordance
[00:14:51.100 --> 00:14:51.520]   with the teaching?
[00:14:51.520 --> 00:14:54.900]   Right? Hey, look.
[00:14:54.900 --> 00:15:00.520]   What about like the Jehovah's Witnesses, Mormons,
[00:15:00.520 --> 00:15:01.740]   other people that use the Bible?
[00:15:01.740 --> 00:15:03.480]   Wouldn't they say that they have the truth?
[00:15:03.480 --> 00:15:06.020]   What about the Presbyterian churches?
[00:15:06.020 --> 00:15:07.780]   What about the Wesleyan churches, Methodist churches?
[00:15:07.780 --> 00:15:10.460]   Why are we like so snooty and falutey
[00:15:10.460 --> 00:15:12.120]   about like we alone have the truth?
[00:15:12.120 --> 00:15:13.140]   No, that's not what we're saying.
[00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:18.300]   It's every person who says that they're a child of God,
[00:15:18.300 --> 00:15:24.140]   every church that represents Jesus Christ must dig deep
[00:15:24.180 --> 00:15:27.800]   into the scriptures and pour over every page of it
[00:15:27.800 --> 00:15:31.160]   to make sure what they're proclaiming is accurate
[00:15:31.160 --> 00:15:33.360]   to what God desires to be proclaimed.
[00:15:33.360 --> 00:15:36.100]   You guys following that?
[00:15:36.100 --> 00:15:39.300]   And obviously, we are limited in our understanding,
[00:15:39.300 --> 00:15:40.980]   but we can't be lazy.
[00:15:40.980 --> 00:15:47.020]   So we need to hold fast scriptures cover to cover
[00:15:47.020 --> 00:15:51.380]   in the way that God wanted it to be dispensed.
[00:15:51.380 --> 00:15:52.940]   All right?
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:54.500]   You guys following me?
[00:15:54.500 --> 00:15:59.620]   So this is where we get the word sufficiency of scripture.
[00:15:59.620 --> 00:16:01.560]   Okay? And that's something
[00:16:01.560 --> 00:16:03.120]   that is emphasized a lot in our church.
[00:16:03.120 --> 00:16:06.160]   The sufficiency of scripture means
[00:16:06.160 --> 00:16:10.480]   that scripture contained all the words of God he intended his
[00:16:10.480 --> 00:16:13.540]   people to have at each stage of redemptive history
[00:16:13.540 --> 00:16:17.440]   and that it now contains all the words of God we need
[00:16:17.440 --> 00:16:20.460]   for salvation, for trusting him perfectly,
[00:16:20.460 --> 00:16:22.660]   and for obeying him perfectly.
[00:16:23.420 --> 00:16:25.060]   The word of God is enough.
[00:16:25.060 --> 00:16:30.260]   Amen? The word of God is enough.
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:33.780]   It can change your thinking.
[00:16:33.780 --> 00:16:35.800]   It can change all your problems.
[00:16:35.800 --> 00:16:39.660]   It can do away with the very fleshly weaknesses
[00:16:39.660 --> 00:16:40.660]   that are in your life.
[00:16:40.660 --> 00:16:44.060]   It can answer all the questions that are difficult to answer
[00:16:44.060 --> 00:16:45.220]   about all of the things
[00:16:45.220 --> 00:16:46.800]   that are surrounding our lives right now,
[00:16:46.800 --> 00:16:49.780]   whether it's racial things, political things,
[00:16:50.620 --> 00:16:54.460]   ethical moral things, even to who shall I marry?
[00:16:54.460 --> 00:16:56.820]   My loved one has cancer.
[00:16:56.820 --> 00:16:58.380]   How do I deal with that person?
[00:16:58.380 --> 00:17:00.740]   Should I take this job?
[00:17:00.740 --> 00:17:01.420]   Should I not?
[00:17:01.420 --> 00:17:04.120]   How should I raise my kids?
[00:17:04.120 --> 00:17:07.200]   Should women work outside the home?
[00:17:07.200 --> 00:17:08.680]   And we're going to look at that in a few weeks.
[00:17:08.680 --> 00:17:14.180]   Every single thing that God intended us to know
[00:17:14.180 --> 00:17:18.040]   of his heart are in the 66 books that we have.
[00:17:18.580 --> 00:17:24.720]   And our job, not to hold on to like our opinion
[00:17:24.720 --> 00:17:26.600]   or how we feel about the verses.
[00:17:26.600 --> 00:17:30.480]   We're supposed to scrutinize the verses and do our best
[00:17:30.480 --> 00:17:32.980]   to know God's heart through the word of God.
[00:17:32.980 --> 00:17:37.280]   And it's enough to change our lives, to feed our souls,
[00:17:37.280 --> 00:17:39.900]   and to move us in the direction that he would have us go.
[00:17:39.900 --> 00:17:42.160]   You guys following this?
[00:17:42.160 --> 00:17:46.400]   So that's what the sufficiency of scripture means is.
[00:17:46.660 --> 00:17:48.500]   And so we're not supposed to casually,
[00:17:48.500 --> 00:17:49.880]   loosely hold on to these things.
[00:17:49.880 --> 00:17:51.560]   We're supposed to dive in.
[00:17:51.560 --> 00:17:56.840]   And this is to be one of our chief responsibilities.
[00:17:56.840 --> 00:17:59.140]   So if you guys, I know some people,
[00:17:59.140 --> 00:18:02.640]   like this is the only Bible intake that you have.
[00:18:02.640 --> 00:18:04.360]   And that's better than nothing.
[00:18:04.360 --> 00:18:07.220]   But preparing for our Wednesday night Bible study,
[00:18:07.220 --> 00:18:09.120]   it really should be bare minimum.
[00:18:09.120 --> 00:18:11.940]   It's kind of like saying, well, I ate once this week.
[00:18:11.940 --> 00:18:16.300]   Yeah, you try that, you're going to physically like collapse.
[00:18:17.300 --> 00:18:19.920]   Make sure in every facet of your life,
[00:18:19.920 --> 00:18:23.860]   the word of God is filling your spiritual body.
[00:18:23.860 --> 00:18:27.560]   Feeding daily.
[00:18:27.560 --> 00:18:32.900]   Okay? So that's just what I'm gleaning from this.
[00:18:32.900 --> 00:18:37.960]   And this is consistent with Paul's exhortation
[00:18:37.960 --> 00:18:39.180]   to all church leadership.
[00:18:39.180 --> 00:18:41.400]   And I mean, obviously, to Christians as well.
[00:18:41.400 --> 00:18:44.980]   Why do we need to hold fast to faithful word,
[00:18:44.980 --> 00:18:46.320]   which is in accordance with the teaching,
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:51.640]   and have all of these moral characters line up,
[00:18:51.640 --> 00:18:56.240]   so that we can exhort and refute?
[00:18:56.240 --> 00:19:01.060]   We need to feed the sheep and fight off the wolves.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.920]   Okay? So that we can feed the sheep, fight off the wolves,
[00:19:04.920 --> 00:19:08.560]   we need to make sure not only are we intaking the word
[00:19:08.560 --> 00:19:11.800]   of God regularly, we need to make sure our lives are living
[00:19:11.800 --> 00:19:13.840]   up to what we say we believe.
[00:19:13.840 --> 00:19:16.200]   And this also applies to your guys' lives.
[00:19:16.200 --> 00:19:18.220]   If you have non-Christians in your family,
[00:19:18.220 --> 00:19:23.620]   is your life exuding the aroma of Christ?
[00:19:23.620 --> 00:19:27.300]   Are you getting in your own way of evangelism?
[00:19:27.300 --> 00:19:29.440]   It's something I can hold your feet to the fire in.
[00:19:29.440 --> 00:19:33.240]   Right? At work, everyone knows you go to church,
[00:19:33.240 --> 00:19:35.340]   everyone knows you're a Christian, but are you lazy?
[00:19:35.340 --> 00:19:38.480]   That damages your witness.
[00:19:38.480 --> 00:19:41.660]   We're going to look at in Titus chapter 2, as a bond slave,
[00:19:41.660 --> 00:19:42.540]   what you're supposed to be doing.
[00:19:42.780 --> 00:19:48.380]   Right? So 1 Timothy 4, 16, pay close attention to yourself
[00:19:48.380 --> 00:19:49.800]   and to your teaching.
[00:19:49.800 --> 00:19:52.360]   Persevere in these things, for as you do this,
[00:19:52.360 --> 00:19:54.100]   you will ensure salvation both for yourself
[00:19:54.100 --> 00:19:55.080]   and for those who hear you.
[00:19:55.080 --> 00:19:56.580]   I like the NIV on this one.
[00:19:56.580 --> 00:20:01.440]   Watch your life and doctrine closely for the rest
[00:20:01.440 --> 00:20:01.880]   of your life.
[00:20:01.880 --> 00:20:05.960]   Scrutinize every single aspect of your theology
[00:20:05.960 --> 00:20:09.660]   and your doctrine and the way you practice that in your life.
[00:20:10.500 --> 00:20:13.340]   Right? And the more you know God,
[00:20:13.340 --> 00:20:16.360]   the more humble you should become, the more gracious
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:17.260]   and loving you should become.
[00:20:17.260 --> 00:20:19.760]   That's a natural byproduct of being near Christ.
[00:20:19.760 --> 00:20:22.200]   Right? So watch your life and doctrine closely.
[00:20:22.200 --> 00:20:26.240]   Now, the whole passage actually, though,
[00:20:26.240 --> 00:20:27.840]   is about elders and overseers.
[00:20:27.840 --> 00:20:30.720]   Okay? So I'm going to wrap with -- not wrap.
[00:20:30.720 --> 00:20:34.600]   I'm going to wrap this up with just a brief thought
[00:20:34.600 --> 00:20:35.600]   on elders and overseers.
[00:20:35.600 --> 00:20:37.640]   This was a slide that was up here two weeks ago.
[00:20:38.300 --> 00:20:41.000]   So we're looking at what does Titus 1, 4 through 9 have to say?
[00:20:41.000 --> 00:20:42.500]   What does all of Titus have to say?
[00:20:42.500 --> 00:20:44.740]   What do the other pastoral epistles have to say?
[00:20:44.740 --> 00:20:47.600]   What does the whole Bible have to say about what kinds
[00:20:47.600 --> 00:20:49.080]   of men we put up in the front?
[00:20:49.080 --> 00:20:51.100]   Okay? I made a list.
[00:20:51.100 --> 00:20:54.060]   And again, this will be accessible to you online.
[00:20:54.060 --> 00:21:00.480]   A.V., thank you.
[00:21:00.480 --> 00:21:03.960]   So I just wrote it all out.
[00:21:05.200 --> 00:21:10.160]   Okay? So if you notice, first Timothy and Titus,
[00:21:10.160 --> 00:21:13.520]   it's almost like very parallel, very similar.
[00:21:13.520 --> 00:21:17.700]   Except Timothy goes into a little bit more.
[00:21:17.700 --> 00:21:19.660]   All right?
[00:21:19.660 --> 00:21:23.540]   And he mentions only one skill.
[00:21:23.540 --> 00:21:27.360]   Out of all of these things, only one skill is mentioned,
[00:21:27.360 --> 00:21:28.660]   and that's able to teach.
[00:21:28.660 --> 00:21:33.620]   But even that can also be interpreted as a character,
[00:21:33.620 --> 00:21:34.960]   like qualified to teach.
[00:21:35.680 --> 00:21:43.000]   So out of all of these things, only one word that is skill-based.
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:49.720]   And like I said, even that one skill is also a character thing.
[00:21:49.720 --> 00:21:52.580]   Okay? And some other instructions.
[00:21:52.580 --> 00:21:54.240]   He must not be a new convert.
[00:21:54.240 --> 00:21:58.120]   There are a lot of passionate, gifted people who just came
[00:21:58.120 --> 00:22:00.300]   to faith, you should never put them up in the front,
[00:22:00.300 --> 00:22:01.700]   because it will destroy them.
[00:22:01.700 --> 00:22:04.100]   Like the devil.
[00:22:04.860 --> 00:22:06.840]   Okay? And I'll get to that.
[00:22:06.840 --> 00:22:08.260]   They must first be tested.
[00:22:08.260 --> 00:22:10.800]   So deacons are supposed to be tested in chapter 3, verse 10.
[00:22:10.800 --> 00:22:13.340]   And that's not a leadership position.
[00:22:13.340 --> 00:22:16.800]   So if a service position, that person should be tested
[00:22:16.800 --> 00:22:18.400]   in their character, how much more
[00:22:18.400 --> 00:22:20.540]   so should a pastor, elder, et cetera, et cetera.
[00:22:20.540 --> 00:22:21.580]   And how long does it take to get
[00:22:21.580 --> 00:22:23.600]   to really test someone's character?
[00:22:23.600 --> 00:22:24.620]   Two months?
[00:22:24.620 --> 00:22:25.980]   Six months?
[00:22:25.980 --> 00:22:28.980]   One year? I say minimum three.
[00:22:28.980 --> 00:22:31.780]   Because you don't really know what's inside
[00:22:31.780 --> 00:22:32.500]   until you squeeze them.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:35.640]   Right? That first negative comment that they hear,
[00:22:35.640 --> 00:22:38.460]   the first drama that they have to face, how do they respond?
[00:22:38.460 --> 00:22:42.940]   Okay? So accusations are serious business,
[00:22:42.940 --> 00:22:45.560]   worthy of double honor, and you're not supposed
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:46.400]   to ordain hastily.
[00:22:46.400 --> 00:22:49.260]   Okay? So those are the leadership qualities
[00:22:49.260 --> 00:22:50.560]   that we see in 1 Timothy.
[00:22:50.560 --> 00:22:54.920]   1 Peter, they're more like motivations,
[00:22:54.920 --> 00:22:57.700]   but shepherding voluntarily, shepherding according
[00:22:57.700 --> 00:22:59.280]   to the will of God, not for sort of gain.
[00:22:59.280 --> 00:23:02.700]   Eager. Not lording it, not overbearing.
[00:23:03.700 --> 00:23:04.920]   And proving to be examples.
[00:23:04.920 --> 00:23:08.200]   So these are the lists of qualifications.
[00:23:08.200 --> 00:23:13.160]   Nowhere does it say their resume, their degree,
[00:23:13.160 --> 00:23:17.540]   their ability to engage you with clever stories and gimmicks.
[00:23:17.540 --> 00:23:20.600]   Nowhere does it say how much money they give to the church.
[00:23:20.600 --> 00:23:24.200]   Nowhere does it say their personality strengths.
[00:23:24.200 --> 00:23:25.340]   Oh, they're such a people person,
[00:23:25.340 --> 00:23:26.600]   they can draw the masses.
[00:23:26.600 --> 00:23:29.120]   It doesn't say what seminate that they graduated from,
[00:23:29.120 --> 00:23:31.020]   or even if they graduated college.
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:36.400]   So what the world's churches today look
[00:23:36.400 --> 00:23:38.740]   for in a spiritual leader, and what the Bible says we need
[00:23:38.740 --> 00:23:40.240]   to look for, look very different.
[00:23:40.240 --> 00:23:44.520]   Right? So that's just, I put this on there
[00:23:44.520 --> 00:23:47.080]   so you can consult this later
[00:23:47.080 --> 00:23:48.260]   when it gets made available online.
[00:23:48.260 --> 00:23:49.380]   All right?
[00:23:49.380 --> 00:23:51.560]   All of these are character.
[00:23:51.560 --> 00:23:56.020]   Because if your character is flawed, you get in the way
[00:23:56.020 --> 00:23:59.280]   of adorning the gospel, adorning the doctrine of God.
[00:24:00.360 --> 00:24:03.580]   Okay? And this should be of every Christian,
[00:24:03.580 --> 00:24:08.220]   but especially those who are in the front.
[00:24:08.220 --> 00:24:09.800]   Now, just a couple of things.
[00:24:09.800 --> 00:24:13.700]   Not a new convert so that he will not become conceited
[00:24:13.700 --> 00:24:15.660]   and fall into condemnation incurred by the devil.
[00:24:15.660 --> 00:24:19.100]   He must have a good reputation with those outside the church
[00:24:19.100 --> 00:24:21.060]   so that he will not fall into reproach
[00:24:21.060 --> 00:24:22.400]   and the snare of the devil.
[00:24:22.400 --> 00:24:28.620]   So some churches, whoever seems like they have the most fire lit
[00:24:28.620 --> 00:24:32.860]   under their like just spiritual wings, you try to put them
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:33.640]   up in a position.
[00:24:33.640 --> 00:24:35.220]   We don't do that.
[00:24:35.220 --> 00:24:38.080]   Because they can become very arrogant and conceited.
[00:24:38.080 --> 00:24:41.200]   So if you guys are sitting here like, "How come I wasn't asked
[00:24:41.200 --> 00:24:42.100]   to be small group leader?"
[00:24:42.100 --> 00:24:43.280]   Because we have that sometimes.
[00:24:43.280 --> 00:24:46.220]   "How come that person was asked but I didn't get asked?"
[00:24:46.220 --> 00:24:52.080]   Ooh. That's one attitude that you should really examine.
[00:24:52.080 --> 00:24:56.760]   Okay? Why do you want to do this?
[00:24:57.300 --> 00:24:58.740]   Self-willed was one of those words, right?
[00:24:58.740 --> 00:25:00.800]   Above reproach, not self-willed.
[00:25:00.800 --> 00:25:03.640]   Do you want this for yourself and for your recognition
[00:25:03.640 --> 00:25:06.900]   or do you really want to do that to serve the kingdom of God
[00:25:06.900 --> 00:25:07.580]   with fear and trembling?
[00:25:07.580 --> 00:25:08.960]   All right?
[00:25:08.960 --> 00:25:12.520]   So one of the things that we do is we don't just hastily put
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:13.580]   people into positions.
[00:25:13.580 --> 00:25:17.780]   And sometimes, you know, like even if that person was a pastor
[00:25:17.780 --> 00:25:20.100]   and elder or this and that at some other church,
[00:25:20.100 --> 00:25:23.940]   they come in here, we make them do all the membership
[00:25:23.940 --> 00:25:25.360]   and everything, right?
[00:25:25.360 --> 00:25:27.940]   And part of that process is also a good test
[00:25:27.940 --> 00:25:30.280]   to see how they respond when they're not in the front.
[00:25:30.280 --> 00:25:34.320]   First Timothy 3.10, they must be tested.
[00:25:34.320 --> 00:25:38.880]   And again, this is for deacons but it also,
[00:25:38.880 --> 00:25:40.480]   I would assume, applies upward.
[00:25:40.480 --> 00:25:44.800]   And First Timothy 5.22, do not lay hands upon anyone too hastily
[00:25:44.800 --> 00:25:47.660]   and thereby share responsibility for the sin of others.
[00:25:47.660 --> 00:25:50.640]   So one of the reasons we're very slow to put people
[00:25:50.640 --> 00:25:54.640]   up into positions is so that we protect our flock.
[00:25:55.160 --> 00:25:57.060]   Does that make sense?
[00:25:57.060 --> 00:25:59.000]   And you get frustrated sometimes.
[00:25:59.000 --> 00:26:01.000]   We need more leaders.
[00:26:01.000 --> 00:26:01.900]   We know that.
[00:26:01.900 --> 00:26:05.620]   But who should we pick-- put up, right?
[00:26:05.620 --> 00:26:09.620]   Like we want to be very slow because it's easier to wait
[00:26:09.620 --> 00:26:14.360]   for the right person than to hastily put someone in place
[00:26:14.360 --> 00:26:16.520]   and then regret when we take them off.
[00:26:16.520 --> 00:26:19.020]   You guys understand that?
[00:26:19.020 --> 00:26:24.060]   So in the meantime, when our numbers are growing fast,
[00:26:24.060 --> 00:26:27.180]   we have few leaders, everyone needs to do their best
[00:26:27.180 --> 00:26:29.940]   to just help build this church in the way that,
[00:26:29.940 --> 00:26:31.520]   in many ways, only you can.
[00:26:31.520 --> 00:26:37.720]   OK? So here's some applications for you.
[00:26:37.720 --> 00:26:43.200]   These characteristics should be true of all Christians.
[00:26:43.200 --> 00:26:45.240]   What are areas of your life
[00:26:45.240 --> 00:26:47.500]   that your small group members can keep you accountable in?
[00:26:47.500 --> 00:26:49.540]   How can they pray for you?
[00:26:49.540 --> 00:26:52.460]   And you don't want to leave it like, "Oh,
[00:26:52.460 --> 00:26:53.860]   I just need to know God more."
[00:26:54.420 --> 00:26:56.020]   That is very difficult to measure.
[00:26:56.020 --> 00:26:57.360]   All right?
[00:26:57.360 --> 00:26:58.820]   Are you addicted to entertainment?
[00:26:58.820 --> 00:27:02.100]   Are you very pugnacious?
[00:27:02.100 --> 00:27:04.980]   Do you have zero self-control?
[00:27:04.980 --> 00:27:08.900]   Do you struggle just with thought life?
[00:27:08.900 --> 00:27:14.180]   Are you involved in very shady things for financial gain?
[00:27:14.180 --> 00:27:17.120]   These are things that you shouldn't just hold the elders
[00:27:17.120 --> 00:27:17.740]   feet to the fire.
[00:27:17.740 --> 00:27:18.780]   These should be things
[00:27:18.780 --> 00:27:20.100]   that you should examine your own heart.
[00:27:20.100 --> 00:27:22.140]   OK? So what are these things in your life?
[00:27:23.280 --> 00:27:27.280]   And secondly, how fast are you holding to the faithful word?
[00:27:27.280 --> 00:27:31.460]   Is the word of God, the intake of the word of God,
[00:27:31.460 --> 00:27:32.860]   a priority in your life?
[00:27:32.860 --> 00:27:35.440]   And if it is a priority in your life,
[00:27:35.440 --> 00:27:37.980]   are you studying the word of God so you can be known
[00:27:37.980 --> 00:27:39.500]   as someone who studies the word of God?
[00:27:39.500 --> 00:27:41.100]   Or so that you can know the Lord better?
[00:27:41.100 --> 00:27:42.500]   There's a big difference.
[00:27:42.500 --> 00:27:45.840]   OK? There are a lot of people at Bible churches.
[00:27:45.840 --> 00:27:48.980]   It's very -- sometimes it's multifaceted, difficult to tell.
[00:27:48.980 --> 00:27:52.880]   It's easier to fit in when you're actively memorizing,
[00:27:52.880 --> 00:27:53.780]   you're actively studying.
[00:27:53.780 --> 00:27:55.400]   But that's not the motivation.
[00:27:55.400 --> 00:27:56.480]   That should not be the motivation.
[00:27:56.480 --> 00:27:59.640]   Right? And what can you practically do to grow
[00:27:59.640 --> 00:28:02.040]   in your area of Bible knowledge and study?
[00:28:02.040 --> 00:28:05.780]   Is Wednesday the only thing you do for spiritual meat?
[00:28:05.780 --> 00:28:08.620]   Then you're spiritually malnourished.
[00:28:08.620 --> 00:28:13.200]   And you're going to have a hard time spiritually fighting your
[00:28:13.200 --> 00:28:15.740]   spiritual battles if you haven't been eating much.
[00:28:15.740 --> 00:28:19.080]   OK? So let that be just an encouragement to you guys.
[00:28:19.080 --> 00:28:22.180]   And that's what we'll wrap up with in our group.
[00:28:22.180 --> 00:28:22.960]   Just apply.
[00:28:22.960 --> 00:28:26.500]   And this is for next week.
[00:28:26.500 --> 00:28:29.900]   And over the weeks, it's going to be the same stuff.
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:31.460]   This is actually literally copy/paste.
[00:28:31.460 --> 00:28:32.760]   I just changed the date.
[00:28:32.760 --> 00:28:35.160]   OK? And the passage.
[00:28:35.160 --> 00:28:38.900]   So someone asked me, someone from home group,
[00:28:38.900 --> 00:28:40.040]   did you put the questions up?
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:42.220]   I was like -- and I was about to say it's the same ones
[00:28:42.220 --> 00:28:42.840]   from last time.
[00:28:42.840 --> 00:28:48.080]   But because there's a lot of new people, I forgot to put it up.
[00:28:48.080 --> 00:28:48.960]   But I should put it up.
[00:28:48.960 --> 00:28:51.780]   OK? So if you don't see it up, email me like a snob.
[00:28:51.780 --> 00:28:54.460]   And then I'll respond in a gracious way as possible.
[00:28:54.460 --> 00:28:55.100]   All right?
[00:28:55.100 --> 00:28:56.040]   So I'm not pugnacious.
[00:28:56.040 --> 00:28:58.760]   So these are the same questions.
[00:28:58.760 --> 00:29:00.800]   But ultimately, it's just three verses.
[00:29:00.800 --> 00:29:02.100]   You ask questions.
[00:29:02.100 --> 00:29:03.240]   You pour over it.
[00:29:03.240 --> 00:29:05.600]   And then come up with observations.
[00:29:05.600 --> 00:29:08.360]   And then how do these verses fit into the context of the rest
[00:29:08.360 --> 00:29:09.560]   of the section, chapter, letter?
[00:29:09.560 --> 00:29:10.720]   What are some practical,
[00:29:10.720 --> 00:29:12.100]   measurable applications you can draw?
[00:29:12.100 --> 00:29:15.700]   And three weeks in a row, I've gone shorter and shorter.
[00:29:15.700 --> 00:29:18.780]   So by the chapter three, I'm shooting to go
[00:29:18.780 --> 00:29:20.000]   like 10 minutes or less.
[00:29:20.000 --> 00:29:20.780]   All right?
[00:29:21.060 --> 00:29:24.100]   But right now, there's a lot more instructive how-tos
[00:29:24.100 --> 00:29:25.040]   that are happening.
[00:29:25.040 --> 00:29:27.740]   But more and more, the Bible studies are going to be
[00:29:27.740 --> 00:29:29.940]   like your guys' discussion-oriented.
[00:29:29.940 --> 00:29:34.700]   OK? So wrap up with this in your small groups.
[00:29:34.700 --> 00:29:36.900]   And then you finish when you finish.
[00:29:36.900 --> 00:29:39.340]   And then if you guys can, help clean up your area.
[00:29:39.340 --> 00:29:41.660]   And then help us to get ready for Sunday worship.
[00:29:41.660 --> 00:29:42.440]   Let's -- let me pray.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.520]   Father, we want all of these things to be characteristic
[00:29:53.520 --> 00:29:55.720]   of every single member in our church.
[00:29:55.720 --> 00:30:00.100]   That we really just represent you well
[00:30:00.100 --> 00:30:01.800]   to this dark and fallen world.
[00:30:01.800 --> 00:30:05.480]   So in the areas of our weakness, in our areas
[00:30:05.480 --> 00:30:08.180]   where we are very fleshly, in the areas
[00:30:08.180 --> 00:30:10.820]   that are we -- are easily corrupted and sidetracked,
[00:30:10.820 --> 00:30:14.700]   I pray that your grace would sustain us, strengthen us,
[00:30:14.700 --> 00:30:19.260]   and feed us, Lord God, over the course of this next week
[00:30:19.260 --> 00:30:21.620]   until we meet again with your truth, with your word.
[00:30:21.620 --> 00:30:25.520]   We pray for your blessing over the rest of the Bible studies
[00:30:25.520 --> 00:30:26.540]   that are going on this week.
[00:30:26.540 --> 00:30:30.500]   We pray that you would use Pastor Peter in a mighty way
[00:30:30.500 --> 00:30:32.300]   on Sunday as he proclaims your word.
[00:30:32.300 --> 00:30:38.000]   So that every step of just our lives, every day of the week,
[00:30:38.000 --> 00:30:43.340]   we would engage just in feasting off the word of God.
[00:30:43.340 --> 00:30:45.420]   So we pray for your help because the things
[00:30:45.420 --> 00:30:47.660]   of this world do draw our attention away.
[00:30:48.080 --> 00:30:50.460]   So would you encourage, challenge, exhort,
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.380]   and excite us with your word.
[00:30:52.380 --> 00:30:53.580]   And Jesus, let me pray.
[00:30:53.580 --> 00:31:02.580]   Thank you very much.
[00:31:02.580 --> 00:31:12.580]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
