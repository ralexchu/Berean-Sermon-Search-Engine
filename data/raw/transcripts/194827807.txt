[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.400]   And so because it's our last session, the people who are bringing snacks are actually
[00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:10.200]   going to be bringing dinner.
[00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.680]   So dinner will be served between 7 and 7.15.
[00:00:14.680 --> 00:00:17.880]   So if you come at 7.16, there will be no dinner for you.
[00:00:17.880 --> 00:00:18.880]   Okay?
[00:00:18.880 --> 00:00:23.160]   So 7 o'clock, please come on time at 7 o'clock because we are having dinner.
[00:00:23.160 --> 00:00:26.880]   If we start dinner at 7.20 and we don't finish till 8, we're not going to be able to do our
[00:00:26.880 --> 00:00:27.880]   last session.
[00:00:27.880 --> 00:00:30.200]   So please come at 7 o'clock if you want to eat.
[00:00:30.200 --> 00:00:32.200]   I hear it's going to be delicious.
[00:00:32.200 --> 00:00:34.200]   7 to 7.15.
[00:00:34.200 --> 00:00:35.200]   Okay.
[00:00:35.200 --> 00:00:36.200]   All right.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:37.200]   So anyway, just come early.
[00:00:37.200 --> 00:00:38.360]   We're going to have dinner here.
[00:00:38.360 --> 00:00:39.680]   So don't have dinner.
[00:00:39.680 --> 00:00:40.680]   Just come and have dinner.
[00:00:40.680 --> 00:00:44.760]   And then as you guys are eating and having fellowship, we're going to be doing our final
[00:00:44.760 --> 00:00:45.760]   session.
[00:00:45.760 --> 00:00:46.760]   Okay?
[00:00:46.760 --> 00:00:50.240]   And then after that, after next week, we're going to be taking, I think, three weeks,
[00:00:50.240 --> 00:00:55.120]   maybe four weeks off for the Christmas and then the first or second week of January.
[00:00:55.120 --> 00:00:57.840]   And then another session is going to start.
[00:00:57.840 --> 00:00:58.840]   Okay?
[00:00:58.840 --> 00:00:59.840]   All right.
[00:00:59.840 --> 00:01:02.600]   So today the topic, today and next week's topic is going to be on...
[00:01:02.600 --> 00:01:05.240]   Okay, this is not it.
[00:01:05.240 --> 00:01:08.920]   Sorry, I got the wrong notes.
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:11.600]   Oh, shoot.
[00:01:11.600 --> 00:01:16.880]   It's an evil laugh.
[00:01:16.880 --> 00:01:21.400]   Okay, hold on.
[00:01:21.400 --> 00:01:22.400]   I found it.
[00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:23.400]   All right.
[00:01:23.400 --> 00:01:24.400]   Okay.
[00:01:24.400 --> 00:01:28.680]   Today's session is going to be on evangelism.
[00:01:28.680 --> 00:01:34.560]   And again, a lot of this stuff may be review for a lot of you, but again, I think it's
[00:01:34.560 --> 00:01:40.880]   important enough that we understand, you know, where all of our ministry philosophy and theology,
[00:01:40.880 --> 00:01:46.800]   where the rubber meets the road, a lot of times you'll see in the preaching and in evangelism.
[00:01:46.800 --> 00:01:53.000]   You know, depending upon what the church believes and what the theology is, you're not going
[00:01:53.000 --> 00:01:55.800]   to see a whole lot of difference in the way that we sing.
[00:01:55.800 --> 00:01:59.840]   You're not going to see a whole lot of difference from church to church in the way that we pray,
[00:01:59.840 --> 00:02:01.640]   even in the fellowship and the activities.
[00:02:01.640 --> 00:02:02.960]   You're not going to see a whole lot of difference.
[00:02:02.960 --> 00:02:08.320]   But where you will see the distinction is in the preaching and in evangelism and how
[00:02:08.320 --> 00:02:12.840]   you view evangelism, how you practice evangelism is where a lot of the theology kind of gets
[00:02:12.840 --> 00:02:13.840]   played out.
[00:02:13.840 --> 00:02:15.960]   So I want to jump right into it.
[00:02:15.960 --> 00:02:18.560]   So today and next week, we're going to be talking about evangelism.
[00:02:18.560 --> 00:02:23.440]   First of all, this has to work.
[00:02:23.440 --> 00:02:30.160]   I don't know if that dongle is plugged in.
[00:02:30.160 --> 00:02:31.160]   Okay.
[00:02:31.160 --> 00:02:56.840]   Okay, there you go.
[00:02:56.840 --> 00:03:02.360]   So the first, so the way I have it, I don't have, I just kind of left spaces for you to
[00:03:02.360 --> 00:03:04.560]   take notes as we're going along.
[00:03:04.560 --> 00:03:05.560]   Why evangelize?
[00:03:05.560 --> 00:03:08.520]   I mean, it's a pretty straightforward question.
[00:03:08.520 --> 00:03:12.880]   It's one of those, no duh, you know, the Bible tells us so.
[00:03:12.880 --> 00:03:19.360]   But again, understanding the heart of God, understanding all of scripture, evangelism
[00:03:19.360 --> 00:03:21.520]   is directly linked to lordship.
[00:03:21.520 --> 00:03:26.320]   Typically when we think of lordship, we think of time management, we think of finance, right?
[00:03:26.320 --> 00:03:27.880]   And we think of those two things.
[00:03:27.880 --> 00:03:33.720]   But when you take a careful look at the scripture, lordship basically means that somebody else
[00:03:33.720 --> 00:03:37.680]   who is above you is dictating or telling you their priorities.
[00:03:37.680 --> 00:03:41.360]   So whatever they desire, whatever their priority is becomes our priority.
[00:03:41.360 --> 00:03:44.160]   So if he is Lord, what is his priority?
[00:03:44.160 --> 00:03:45.720]   What do we see in scripture?
[00:03:45.720 --> 00:03:46.720]   Right?
[00:03:46.720 --> 00:03:50.000]   So spending of money, time management, all of these things are under the umbrella of
[00:03:50.000 --> 00:03:52.800]   the bigger picture of what God is doing in his history.
[00:03:52.800 --> 00:03:53.800]   Right?
[00:03:53.800 --> 00:03:58.960]   So primary motivation for, dang it.
[00:03:58.960 --> 00:04:05.120]   Okay, maybe it's the battery.
[00:04:05.120 --> 00:04:06.120]   You know what?
[00:04:06.120 --> 00:04:07.120]   It is the battery.
[00:04:07.120 --> 00:04:08.120]   This thing is, yeah.
[00:04:08.120 --> 00:04:09.120]   Do you have battery?
[00:04:09.120 --> 00:04:10.120]   It is the battery.
[00:04:10.120 --> 00:04:11.120]   Because this is not.
[00:04:11.120 --> 00:04:12.120]   Huh?
[00:04:12.120 --> 00:04:13.120]   Triple A.
[00:04:13.120 --> 00:04:14.120]   This is a triple A, right?
[00:04:14.120 --> 00:04:25.600]   Oh, this is double A?
[00:04:25.600 --> 00:04:26.600]   Huh?
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.600]   Yeah, do you have triple A?
[00:04:29.600 --> 00:04:30.600]   Two.
[00:04:30.600 --> 00:04:31.600]   Okay.
[00:04:31.600 --> 00:04:32.600]   It's triple A. That's triple A.
[00:04:33.600 --> 00:04:39.600]   [laughter]
[00:04:40.600 --> 00:04:46.600]   Alright, good. Okay. Alright. So, this is the Bible.
[00:04:46.600 --> 00:05:11.600]   Alright, good. Okay. Alright. Sorry about that.
[00:05:11.600 --> 00:05:15.800]   Alright, so why evangelize?
[00:05:15.800 --> 00:05:20.880]   A, the whole Bible is a recorded history of God pursuing sinners.
[00:05:20.880 --> 00:05:21.960]   Right?
[00:05:21.960 --> 00:05:26.840]   So if you were to understand the theme of the whole Bible, we have to say in one word,
[00:05:26.840 --> 00:05:28.880]   it's a holy God pursuing sinners.
[00:05:28.880 --> 00:05:33.800]   Old Testament all the way to the end of the New Testament.
[00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:37.760]   The Old Testament, just a quick overview of the theme.
[00:05:37.760 --> 00:05:42.800]   It starts, again, obviously in Genesis with the creation and the fall of man and the promise
[00:05:42.800 --> 00:05:44.200]   of a Savior.
[00:05:44.200 --> 00:05:46.320]   The seed of the woman that's going to come.
[00:05:46.320 --> 00:05:50.520]   All of Old Testament history is a fulfillment of that prophecy in Genesis 3.15.
[00:05:50.520 --> 00:05:51.520]   Right?
[00:05:51.520 --> 00:05:53.000]   So how does he fulfill it?
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:56.640]   He establishes the nation of Israel, Genesis chapter 12.
[00:05:56.640 --> 00:05:57.680]   Right?
[00:05:57.680 --> 00:06:00.360]   So where and how is the seed going to come?
[00:06:00.360 --> 00:06:03.440]   It's going to come through the nation of Israel.
[00:06:03.440 --> 00:06:08.600]   And then the giving of the law in the book of Exodus chapter 19 to 24 gives the basic
[00:06:08.600 --> 00:06:11.600]   outline of how this is going to be fulfilled.
[00:06:11.600 --> 00:06:17.880]   So the giving of the law is to set up for the need of what he is going to come and do.
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:18.880]   Right?
[00:06:18.880 --> 00:06:21.280]   So this starts from the very get go.
[00:06:21.280 --> 00:06:23.000]   Man falls.
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.880]   The Bible doesn't describe a whole lot about what happened before they fell.
[00:06:26.880 --> 00:06:29.560]   Because that's not what the Bible records.
[00:06:29.560 --> 00:06:32.200]   It's not a recording of what heaven will be like.
[00:06:32.200 --> 00:06:34.160]   At least not as a whole.
[00:06:34.160 --> 00:06:36.340]   We have bits and pieces of that.
[00:06:36.340 --> 00:06:41.960]   But the reason why creation happens and only two chapters we hear about what happened in
[00:06:41.960 --> 00:06:46.600]   the creation and then right after, Genesis chapter 3, it's the fall because all of the
[00:06:46.600 --> 00:06:50.000]   rest of the Bible is about the fulfillment of this prophecy.
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:51.000]   Okay?
[00:06:51.000 --> 00:06:56.720]   And how is it going to, the nation of Israel, Israel is given the law and law reveals what
[00:06:56.720 --> 00:06:59.400]   this Messiah is going to do.
[00:06:59.400 --> 00:07:05.600]   Creation of the tabernacle, right, basically teaches how does it, what kind of relationship
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:12.920]   does sinners have with the holy God.
[00:07:12.920 --> 00:07:17.960]   And then after the giving of the law and tabernacle, the rest of Israel's history is about the
[00:07:17.960 --> 00:07:21.280]   failure to live up to the commandments of God.
[00:07:21.280 --> 00:07:22.280]   Right?
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.360]   So this is all happening consecutively.
[00:07:25.360 --> 00:07:26.880]   He makes a promise.
[00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:29.200]   God establishes Israel, the channel in which they are going to come.
[00:07:29.200 --> 00:07:34.120]   He gives a law, the tabernacle, all of it to establish the blessings and curses and
[00:07:34.120 --> 00:07:38.400]   the rest of Israel's history is all about how they fail to fulfill the commandment of
[00:07:38.400 --> 00:07:41.720]   God and how now curse is upon them.
[00:07:41.720 --> 00:07:45.520]   And they serve as an example to the rest of mankind.
[00:07:45.520 --> 00:07:46.880]   Right?
[00:07:46.880 --> 00:07:48.240]   After that comes the prophets.
[00:07:48.240 --> 00:07:54.840]   The prophets come and they give warning because of the rebellion against God.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:59.760]   And then the prophets almost always end with a promise of restoration of the remnant of
[00:07:59.760 --> 00:08:01.680]   God's people.
[00:08:01.680 --> 00:08:04.480]   In a nutshell, this is Old Testament.
[00:08:04.480 --> 00:08:08.680]   I just gave you a broad outline of all of the Old Testament.
[00:08:08.680 --> 00:08:12.400]   Any part of the Old Testament you read is going to be under one of these umbrellas.
[00:08:12.400 --> 00:08:13.860]   Okay?
[00:08:13.860 --> 00:08:18.080]   So the point that I'm trying to make in the Old Testament is the whole of Old Testament,
[00:08:18.080 --> 00:08:25.240]   whether it is historical, whether it is the giving of the law or poetry or the prophets,
[00:08:25.240 --> 00:08:30.320]   all of it is about a holy God pursuing sinners.
[00:08:30.320 --> 00:08:33.080]   We come to the New Testament.
[00:08:33.080 --> 00:08:35.120]   Jesus fulfills that prophecy.
[00:08:35.120 --> 00:08:36.120]   Right?
[00:08:36.120 --> 00:08:43.360]   So Genesis begins with the promise of the Messiah coming and New Testament begins with
[00:08:43.360 --> 00:08:46.160]   the fulfillment of that promise.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:47.740]   Right?
[00:08:47.740 --> 00:08:51.880]   Jesus calls his disciples and when he calls them he says, "I will make you fishers of
[00:08:51.880 --> 00:08:54.280]   men."
[00:08:54.280 --> 00:09:01.160]   Because this, again, is in the context, it wasn't the beginning with Jesus' ministry.
[00:09:01.160 --> 00:09:02.800]   This is all of Old Testament.
[00:09:02.800 --> 00:09:06.760]   God's been pursuing to make fishers of men from the very beginning.
[00:09:06.760 --> 00:09:07.840]   Right?
[00:09:07.840 --> 00:09:11.400]   Jesus trains his disciples to preach about the kingdom.
[00:09:11.400 --> 00:09:17.020]   Matthew 10, verse 1, the primary message and primary preparation for the disciples is to
[00:09:17.020 --> 00:09:21.620]   go preach about the kingdom.
[00:09:21.620 --> 00:09:28.880]   Obviously that Jesus' death and resurrection is a fulfillment of all the prophecies.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:30.880]   And then he gives a great commission.
[00:09:30.880 --> 00:09:36.880]   After he has accomplished his work, his ministry purpose for his disciples is to continue the
[00:09:36.880 --> 00:09:39.060]   work that Jesus has been doing.
[00:09:39.060 --> 00:09:44.620]   Jesus came to fulfill the work that God's been doing and then he sends his disciples
[00:09:44.620 --> 00:09:49.440]   to take it further.
[00:09:49.440 --> 00:09:52.640]   The whole book of Acts is a fulfillment of that great commission.
[00:09:52.640 --> 00:09:56.740]   Book of Acts begins by saying, "You will be my witnesses, Jerusalem, Judea, Samaria,
[00:09:56.740 --> 00:09:57.980]   to the remotest part of the world."
[00:09:57.980 --> 00:10:04.460]   So the book of Acts, the 28 chapters are outlined by their period in Jerusalem, a period in
[00:10:04.460 --> 00:10:09.900]   going to Samaria, and then a period of going to the remotest part of the world.
[00:10:09.900 --> 00:10:13.220]   So the whole book of Acts is a fulfillment of the great commission.
[00:10:13.220 --> 00:10:17.780]   The next book, the book of Romans, is a detailed analysis of the gospel message that they are
[00:10:17.780 --> 00:10:19.580]   to go proclaim.
[00:10:19.580 --> 00:10:29.300]   And so rest of the epistles about how the gospel came into the different regions.
[00:10:29.300 --> 00:10:36.300]   So how important is evangelism to lordship?
[00:10:36.300 --> 00:10:37.820]   Shoot.
[00:10:37.820 --> 00:10:39.420]   Sorry.
[00:10:39.420 --> 00:10:43.860]   I messed up.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:11:07.420]   I should have taken this off first.
[00:11:07.420 --> 00:11:12.700]   So how important is evangelism to the great, not only the great commission, but to lordship
[00:11:12.700 --> 00:11:15.260]   is directly linked.
[00:11:15.260 --> 00:11:19.020]   It doesn't matter what kind of steward you are and how great of a time you use and how
[00:11:19.020 --> 00:11:25.740]   giving you are and all of that, but God's primary work is pursuing sinners.
[00:11:25.740 --> 00:11:29.900]   If we're good stewards and good people and good moral people, outside of the context
[00:11:29.900 --> 00:11:35.500]   of pursuing sinners, then we can't properly say that he's our lord because our lord is
[00:11:35.500 --> 00:11:37.340]   doing this work.
[00:11:37.340 --> 00:11:38.700]   Right?
[00:11:38.700 --> 00:11:42.860]   He can't be farming, farming chicken and then you decide to be farming goats.
[00:11:42.860 --> 00:11:43.860]   You know what I mean?
[00:11:43.860 --> 00:11:44.860]   Anyway, that didn't really fit.
[00:11:44.860 --> 00:11:49.740]   It sounded good in my head.
[00:11:49.740 --> 00:11:51.860]   You can't be doing different work.
[00:11:51.860 --> 00:11:53.260]   That was my point, right?
[00:11:53.260 --> 00:11:57.740]   If this is God's work, if this is everything that we know about our God in the old Testament
[00:11:57.740 --> 00:12:03.300]   and new Testament is revealed to us in the context of pursuing sinners, what does it
[00:12:03.300 --> 00:12:05.620]   mean to be joining his kingdom?
[00:12:05.620 --> 00:12:06.620]   Right?
[00:12:06.620 --> 00:12:09.940]   It's to be joining his work, joining what he's doing.
[00:12:09.940 --> 00:12:14.040]   So evangelism is a direct part of lordship.
[00:12:14.040 --> 00:12:19.140]   We can't call him lord and savior if he's just lord saying like, "Well, I give my tenth,
[00:12:19.140 --> 00:12:20.380]   so therefore he's my lord."
[00:12:20.380 --> 00:12:21.380]   Right?
[00:12:21.380 --> 00:12:22.540]   So evangelism is a big part of that.
[00:12:22.540 --> 00:12:31.140]   So not only is that important, if you are not engaged in evangelism at some level, it's
[00:12:31.140 --> 00:12:35.900]   very difficult to understand the Bible, right?
[00:12:35.900 --> 00:12:39.020]   It's very difficult to understand the Bible because the Bible is written in the context
[00:12:39.020 --> 00:12:40.900]   of pursuing sinners.
[00:12:40.900 --> 00:12:45.460]   So it's almost kind of like you don't, you miss the whole point of what the author is
[00:12:45.460 --> 00:12:51.140]   trying to say if you're not engaged, if your mind is not engaged in evangelism.
[00:12:51.140 --> 00:12:55.700]   So all of scripture is written, all the epistles are written in the context of bringing sinners
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:57.820]   to Christ, establishing churches.
[00:12:57.820 --> 00:12:59.620]   Evangelism is talking about suffering.
[00:12:59.620 --> 00:13:02.820]   Suffering is in the context of expanding the kingdom of God.
[00:13:02.820 --> 00:13:06.900]   Persecution is talking about in the context of expanding the kingdom of God.
[00:13:06.900 --> 00:13:11.780]   Purity in the church is written in the context of pursuing sinners in the kingdom of God.
[00:13:11.780 --> 00:13:15.400]   So everything that we know about scripture is in the context of pursuing sinners.
[00:13:15.400 --> 00:13:20.780]   So if we're not actively pursuing sinners, you're trying to understand God outside of
[00:13:20.780 --> 00:13:26.660]   his realm.
[00:13:26.660 --> 00:13:28.620]   If you want to, okay, I had another illustration.
[00:13:28.620 --> 00:13:31.580]   If you want to understand Kobe Bryant, you have to understand basketball.
[00:13:31.580 --> 00:13:33.580]   All right, that's better.
[00:13:33.580 --> 00:13:34.780]   All right.
[00:13:34.780 --> 00:13:38.860]   So you can't know everything about Kobe Bryant and then know nothing about basketball if
[00:13:38.860 --> 00:13:44.020]   you really understand, because that's how closely tied who that person is with basketball,
[00:13:44.020 --> 00:13:45.020]   right?
[00:13:45.020 --> 00:13:48.540]   So if you really say, "Oh, I know everything about basketball and then Kobe Bryant, somebody,
[00:13:48.540 --> 00:13:51.300]   and then somebody says, "Oh, he's a basketball player."
[00:13:51.300 --> 00:13:53.300]   Kobe Bryant's a basketball player?
[00:13:53.300 --> 00:13:57.780]   You don't know anything about him then, because that's his identity, right?
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:13:59.380]   That's my point.
[00:13:59.380 --> 00:14:00.380]   Okay.
[00:14:00.380 --> 00:14:01.580]   All right.
[00:14:01.580 --> 00:14:03.020]   So why do we need to evangelize?
[00:14:03.020 --> 00:14:06.760]   I think that's not anything new to us.
[00:14:06.760 --> 00:14:10.500]   But to what extent this is important, I think that's something that we need to be reminded
[00:14:10.500 --> 00:14:11.500]   of.
[00:14:11.500 --> 00:14:15.500]   The second thing I want to cover is then who should evangelize, right?
[00:14:15.500 --> 00:14:18.620]   Now we know that evangelism is important.
[00:14:18.620 --> 00:14:23.420]   There is, and I think, my guess is most of you are sophisticated enough to know that
[00:14:23.420 --> 00:14:29.260]   you're not going to say evangelism is for the pastors or missionaries or elders or deacons
[00:14:29.260 --> 00:14:30.460]   or just select few people.
[00:14:30.460 --> 00:14:36.740]   I think everybody, if not, most of you will agree that it is for everybody.
[00:14:36.740 --> 00:14:42.320]   But for whatever the reason, even though we say that, we kind of have a lesser degree
[00:14:42.320 --> 00:14:45.020]   of a calling depending on what you are, right?
[00:14:45.020 --> 00:14:48.020]   Well, who should evangelize?
[00:14:48.020 --> 00:14:51.580]   First and foremost, God established the church.
[00:14:51.580 --> 00:14:53.060]   First and foremost.
[00:14:53.060 --> 00:15:00.180]   Now the reason why this is so important is because evangelism has to lead to something,
[00:15:00.180 --> 00:15:01.180]   right?
[00:15:01.180 --> 00:15:05.360]   Remember we talked about that before about the kingdom and we talked about the church,
[00:15:05.360 --> 00:15:10.580]   that salvation is transference of one kingdom to another kingdom, right?
[00:15:10.580 --> 00:15:13.940]   So evangelism has to be connected to the church.
[00:15:13.940 --> 00:15:18.700]   If somebody accepts Christ, and I remember reading a statistics years ago, that Billy
[00:15:18.700 --> 00:15:22.940]   Graham statistic, they said that out of all the people who come down and raise their hand,
[00:15:22.940 --> 00:15:25.740]   only 6% of them ever make it to the church.
[00:15:25.740 --> 00:15:31.820]   And out of the 6% who make it to the church, very few of them remain after a year.
[00:15:31.820 --> 00:15:36.940]   So according to their statistics, less than 1% actually continue to walk with the Lord.
[00:15:36.940 --> 00:15:39.260]   And again, this was a statistic from many, many years ago.
[00:15:39.260 --> 00:15:41.900]   I don't know if that's still true, right?
[00:15:41.900 --> 00:15:46.100]   But if that's the case, that means 99% of the people completely missed the whole point
[00:15:46.100 --> 00:15:47.800]   of the gospel.
[00:15:47.800 --> 00:15:51.540]   If they heard the gospel and say, "Well, I believe in Jesus," and they just walked out,
[00:15:51.540 --> 00:15:52.620]   right?
[00:15:52.620 --> 00:16:01.140]   Because the scripture says in 1 Timothy 3.15, sorry, it's so small.
[00:16:01.140 --> 00:16:02.940]   It looked big on my screen.
[00:16:02.940 --> 00:16:07.260]   Okay, "If I delay, you may know how one ought to behave in a household of God, which is
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:12.660]   the church of the living God, a pillar and buttress of the truth."
[00:16:12.660 --> 00:16:16.300]   So the pillar and buttress of the truth was not an individual or group of people, but
[00:16:16.300 --> 00:16:17.300]   the church.
[00:16:17.300 --> 00:16:23.860]   Matthew 16.18, "And I tell you, you are Peter, and on this rock I will build my church, and
[00:16:23.860 --> 00:16:26.660]   the gates of hell shall not prevail against it."
[00:16:26.660 --> 00:16:30.260]   Again, I've mentioned this before, but when we talk about gates of hell shall not prevail
[00:16:30.260 --> 00:16:35.140]   against it, for years I understood this as kind of like a, you know, you gather in the
[00:16:35.140 --> 00:16:40.100]   church and Satan can't attack it, but if you look at the language, the gates is not the
[00:16:40.100 --> 00:16:43.260]   church, it's hell, right?
[00:16:43.260 --> 00:16:47.420]   That the gates of hell will not be able to withstand the church.
[00:16:47.420 --> 00:16:49.500]   So who's on the offensive?
[00:16:49.500 --> 00:16:50.860]   It's the church.
[00:16:50.860 --> 00:16:54.300]   And hell is on the defensive, at least that's the way Jesus described it.
[00:16:54.300 --> 00:16:57.780]   So the church was established to what?
[00:16:57.780 --> 00:17:00.260]   Reconquer what was lost.
[00:17:00.260 --> 00:17:03.620]   So church was not meant to be a fortress to kind of hide in.
[00:17:03.620 --> 00:17:07.780]   So he says, "I will build my church, and the gates of hell will not be able to withstand
[00:17:07.780 --> 00:17:08.780]   it."
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:09.780]   Right?
[00:17:09.780 --> 00:17:16.620]   Acts chapter 2, you know, the early church, when the first converts come to Christ, it
[00:17:16.620 --> 00:17:21.140]   says, "And day by day, attending the temple together and breaking bread in their homes,
[00:17:21.140 --> 00:17:24.860]   they received their food with glad and generous hearts, praising God and having favor with
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:29.900]   all the people, and the Lord added to their number, day by day, those who were being saved."
[00:17:29.900 --> 00:17:34.020]   You see how people were being saved, and when they're being saved, it's described as, "Oh,
[00:17:34.020 --> 00:17:36.260]   they got saved and they just got added to the kingdom."
[00:17:36.260 --> 00:17:38.460]   It says, "They got added to their number."
[00:17:38.460 --> 00:17:41.880]   The church was growing, right?
[00:17:41.880 --> 00:17:45.900]   So the first thing that we know is that church as a whole, the collective body of Christ
[00:17:45.900 --> 00:17:50.260]   has been called for evangelism, right?
[00:17:50.260 --> 00:17:52.980]   Not just the pastor, not just a few people, but the whole church.
[00:17:52.980 --> 00:18:00.700]   So the church, and I remember having this conversation with a young pastor with a brand
[00:18:00.700 --> 00:18:06.260]   new church, and the church is growing, and one of the things that I was really convicted
[00:18:06.260 --> 00:18:12.580]   by, especially in the last few years, our church has been around almost 20 years.
[00:18:12.580 --> 00:18:17.140]   And some of you guys are new to the church, and some people have been here for 10, 15,
[00:18:17.140 --> 00:18:20.020]   and very few have been here all 20 years.
[00:18:20.020 --> 00:18:25.140]   But just like anything else, after you've been in one place for a long time, everything
[00:18:25.140 --> 00:18:26.140]   gets old.
[00:18:26.140 --> 00:18:27.460]   Like everything gets old.
[00:18:27.460 --> 00:18:29.220]   The fellowship gets old.
[00:18:29.220 --> 00:18:34.980]   Everything sounds similar, and sometimes just because it's different, it sounds better,
[00:18:34.980 --> 00:18:35.980]   right?
[00:18:35.980 --> 00:18:42.660]   And so how do you keep that excitement and that passion and the vision when you have
[00:18:42.660 --> 00:18:48.940]   the same thing, same person, same group for 20 years, right?
[00:18:48.940 --> 00:18:53.100]   And I think the challenge that we have is the church, the calling for the church is
[00:18:53.100 --> 00:18:56.580]   always the Great Commission.
[00:18:56.580 --> 00:18:58.260]   Always the Great Commission.
[00:18:58.260 --> 00:19:01.100]   It's not just in the beginning part where you're church planting.
[00:19:01.100 --> 00:19:05.980]   Now usually when you first church plant, that's when everybody's excited about evangelizing
[00:19:05.980 --> 00:19:08.180]   because they want to see new people come to the church.
[00:19:08.180 --> 00:19:12.020]   But for some reason, after a church gets to a certain point, it's kind of like, "Okay,
[00:19:12.020 --> 00:19:13.020]   that's enough."
[00:19:13.020 --> 00:19:14.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:19:14.020 --> 00:19:16.300]   You don't say that, but you feel that.
[00:19:16.300 --> 00:19:17.300]   We have already people.
[00:19:17.300 --> 00:19:18.900]   I don't even know the people who are already here.
[00:19:18.900 --> 00:19:20.900]   Are we going to add more people to this?
[00:19:20.900 --> 00:19:26.260]   Well, the early church had 3,000, and then another 4,000.
[00:19:26.260 --> 00:19:31.140]   So the purpose of the church is for world evangelization.
[00:19:31.140 --> 00:19:34.140]   So whenever somebody asks me, "How big is okay?
[00:19:34.140 --> 00:19:35.700]   At what point do you stop?"
[00:19:35.700 --> 00:19:38.180]   It's like, "When we reach 7 billion people."
[00:19:38.180 --> 00:19:43.380]   When our church is 7 billion and the whole world is reached, that's when God says, "Okay,
[00:19:43.380 --> 00:19:44.380]   that's enough."
[00:19:44.460 --> 00:19:49.020]   Until then, our vision will always be the Great Commission because that's His vision,
[00:19:49.020 --> 00:19:50.020]   right?
[00:19:50.020 --> 00:19:52.180]   It doesn't mean we're going to have 7 billion people.
[00:19:52.180 --> 00:19:55.820]   I understand what the question is, like how do you manage the church and all that.
[00:19:55.820 --> 00:20:00.060]   But again, as far as the vision is concerned, we have to function like a church, brand new
[00:20:00.060 --> 00:20:02.940]   church plant every single year.
[00:20:02.940 --> 00:20:08.940]   Again, Ephesians, "To me though, I am the very least of the saints.
[00:20:08.940 --> 00:20:13.460]   This grace was given to preach to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ and to bring
[00:20:13.460 --> 00:20:18.260]   to light for everyone what is the plan of mystery hidden for ages in God who create
[00:20:18.260 --> 00:20:23.060]   all things so that through the church the manifold wisdom of God might now be made known
[00:20:23.060 --> 00:20:25.300]   to the rulers and authorities in heavenly places."
[00:20:25.300 --> 00:20:26.460]   So through what?
[00:20:26.460 --> 00:20:29.020]   Through the church, right?
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   Manifold wisdom.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:31.020]   What did you talk about the manifold wisdom?
[00:20:31.020 --> 00:20:32.260]   The gospel.
[00:20:32.260 --> 00:20:34.500]   To make it known when?
[00:20:34.500 --> 00:20:37.700]   This was according to eternal purpose.
[00:20:37.700 --> 00:20:39.500]   This wasn't inaugurated by Jesus Himself.
[00:20:39.500 --> 00:20:42.820]   This was God's intent always through the church, right?
[00:20:42.820 --> 00:20:45.580]   And you see glimpses of the church in Israel's history.
[00:20:45.580 --> 00:20:52.220]   How God breaks the whole body of the Old Testament saints into tribes and then to families and
[00:20:52.220 --> 00:20:53.220]   then groups.
[00:20:53.220 --> 00:21:01.020]   Basically, those were pre-church, right?
[00:21:01.020 --> 00:21:05.260]   Number two, or letter B, under who should evangelize.
[00:21:05.260 --> 00:21:08.780]   B, different gifts were given to build up the church.
[00:21:08.780 --> 00:21:10.140]   The various people in the church.
[00:21:10.140 --> 00:21:14.820]   There are certain things that I'm able to do because I'm the pastor, I have a mouth,
[00:21:14.820 --> 00:21:21.060]   I was trained a certain way and so I can evangelize by preaching and teaching and shepherding
[00:21:21.060 --> 00:21:23.140]   and managing the church.
[00:21:23.140 --> 00:21:28.060]   But I'm only one person, right?
[00:21:28.060 --> 00:21:30.940]   I mean, of course, we have various leaders.
[00:21:30.940 --> 00:21:36.940]   But in the church, there are certain people that are better reached by you.
[00:21:36.940 --> 00:21:38.780]   Much better reached by you.
[00:21:38.780 --> 00:21:43.540]   And this is the honest truth and I'm not just saying this.
[00:21:43.540 --> 00:21:48.940]   If I saw, personally, if I saw somebody like me coming to me to evangelize, I would not
[00:21:48.940 --> 00:21:49.940]   be very receptive.
[00:21:49.940 --> 00:21:53.440]   Because I'm a very skeptical person.
[00:21:53.440 --> 00:21:58.940]   If somebody's good at selling something, I'm automatically turned off by it.
[00:21:58.940 --> 00:22:05.060]   Usually when I meet a salesman who is saying all the wrong things and won't make eye contact
[00:22:05.060 --> 00:22:09.180]   and tell me exactly how much they make and what kind of profit they make off of this
[00:22:09.180 --> 00:22:13.180]   and it sounds like they're not good at their job, I tend to let my guard down a little
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:16.100]   bit and trust them better.
[00:22:16.100 --> 00:22:21.360]   But if somebody is smooth talking, he got his presentation down and this guy sounds
[00:22:21.360 --> 00:22:25.500]   like a salesman, my immediate reaction to him is I don't trust anything that comes out
[00:22:25.500 --> 00:22:26.500]   of this guy's mouth.
[00:22:26.500 --> 00:22:29.700]   Because I don't know if that's genuine or not.
[00:22:29.700 --> 00:22:30.700]   That's me.
[00:22:30.700 --> 00:22:31.700]   I'm not sure if that's how you are.
[00:22:31.700 --> 00:22:32.700]   But that's how I am.
[00:22:32.700 --> 00:22:34.220]   I'm a skeptic by nature.
[00:22:34.220 --> 00:22:37.980]   So somebody like me will not be very effective with somebody like me.
[00:22:37.980 --> 00:22:40.580]   As an example, right?
[00:22:40.580 --> 00:22:45.860]   Evangelism, a lot of people think like, oh if you're a pastor and you know how to talk
[00:22:45.860 --> 00:22:48.980]   and you know how to present, you need somebody like that to be effective.
[00:22:48.980 --> 00:22:54.660]   There's a lot of people like me that wouldn't listen to people like me.
[00:22:54.660 --> 00:22:57.460]   And that's why God has given various gifts to various people.
[00:22:57.460 --> 00:23:01.140]   There's certain kind of personalities that you have and it's not all outgoing.
[00:23:01.140 --> 00:23:04.380]   This is not like high school where you have the cool kids and the non-cool kids.
[00:23:04.380 --> 00:23:09.700]   God has given gifts to everybody to serve a purpose because the whole world needs to
[00:23:09.700 --> 00:23:12.580]   be reached, not a certain type of people.
[00:23:12.580 --> 00:23:18.180]   So if you only let people with my kind of personality to evangelize, you're only going
[00:23:18.180 --> 00:23:21.260]   to reach a portion of the population.
[00:23:21.260 --> 00:23:24.600]   So in order for evangelism to be effective, it has to be the whole church using their
[00:23:24.600 --> 00:23:29.460]   various gifts to reach out to various people.
[00:23:29.460 --> 00:23:32.740]   So again, it says, "And he gave the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, the pastors
[00:23:32.740 --> 00:23:36.060]   and teachers to equip the saints for the work of ministry."
[00:23:36.060 --> 00:23:37.060]   Right?
[00:23:37.060 --> 00:23:40.460]   It's not just simply equip you so that you would know theology, it's to equip you so
[00:23:40.460 --> 00:23:41.780]   that you would do ministry.
[00:23:41.780 --> 00:23:46.100]   So the purpose of all of this is not simply so that we can get on the same page and say,
[00:23:46.100 --> 00:23:48.180]   "Ha, we're all thinking the same way."
[00:23:48.180 --> 00:23:51.740]   It's to equip you so that you can serve better, evangelize better.
[00:23:51.740 --> 00:23:52.740]   Right?
[00:23:52.740 --> 00:23:58.820]   You can reach out to other people better.
[00:23:58.820 --> 00:24:01.900]   To each is given the manifestation of the Spirit for the common good.
[00:24:01.900 --> 00:24:06.900]   So everything that God has given us, he gave us for the purpose of sharing.
[00:24:06.900 --> 00:24:07.900]   Right?
[00:24:07.900 --> 00:24:13.140]   Not simply for us to enjoy, but for other people to enjoy.
[00:24:13.140 --> 00:24:15.300]   So again, this is something that I've noticed.
[00:24:15.300 --> 00:24:21.820]   And I've noticed even with the Welcome Team, that there are certain people who are, and
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:27.540]   I've shared this before, don't be offended, I've noticed that awkward people tend to,
[00:24:27.540 --> 00:24:31.660]   okay, my definition of awkward, awkward people tend to gravitate toward awkward people.
[00:24:31.660 --> 00:24:32.660]   That's what I noticed.
[00:24:32.660 --> 00:24:34.020]   You know what I mean?
[00:24:34.020 --> 00:24:37.500]   Awkward meaning like, they're not the most outgoing people.
[00:24:37.500 --> 00:24:38.500]   Right?
[00:24:38.500 --> 00:24:42.700]   And they got somebody who's like, "Oh, really bubbly and comes to, hey, come sit with us,
[00:24:42.700 --> 00:24:43.700]   come to our party."
[00:24:43.700 --> 00:24:46.700]   Like, "Yeah, yeah, you give me a headache."
[00:24:46.700 --> 00:24:53.340]   But I've noticed that people who tend to be a little bit more shy and not as social, they
[00:24:53.340 --> 00:24:57.660]   tend to be better with other people who are the same way, because they feel more relaxed
[00:24:57.660 --> 00:24:58.660]   with that person.
[00:24:58.660 --> 00:24:59.660]   Right?
[00:24:59.660 --> 00:25:01.220]   And I see that even in the Welcome Team.
[00:25:01.220 --> 00:25:02.220]   Right?
[00:25:02.220 --> 00:25:08.020]   So even evangelism, there are people at your work that would probably, you're probably
[00:25:08.020 --> 00:25:11.380]   the best person to share the gospel with them.
[00:25:11.380 --> 00:25:14.620]   And a lot of times we're thinking, "Well, I'm not gifted in speaking, and I'm not good
[00:25:14.620 --> 00:25:15.620]   at saying this.
[00:25:15.620 --> 00:25:17.540]   What if I, you know, fumble through my words?"
[00:25:17.540 --> 00:25:23.100]   And maybe there's somebody in that group like me, trusts you better because you're not so
[00:25:23.100 --> 00:25:24.100]   good.
[00:25:24.100 --> 00:25:28.300]   I don't know if that came out right.
[00:25:28.300 --> 00:25:29.660]   But you understand what I'm saying, right?
[00:25:29.660 --> 00:25:31.220]   You understand what I'm saying?
[00:25:31.220 --> 00:25:33.580]   So in God's design, God designed it that way.
[00:25:33.580 --> 00:25:42.940]   There's no one particular gift, one particular person that will be effective doing everything.
[00:25:42.940 --> 00:25:48.320]   Every age, for whatever the reason, we have a tendency to think evangelism and mission
[00:25:48.320 --> 00:25:50.380]   is for young people.
[00:25:50.380 --> 00:25:54.860]   You know, and once you have kids and you get a little bit older, that's not for us.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:55.860]   Like this is missions.
[00:25:55.860 --> 00:25:56.860]   Right?
[00:25:56.860 --> 00:26:05.780]   Like I said, you know, if this is the heartbeat of God, until the day we die, it is our calling.
[00:26:05.780 --> 00:26:09.740]   And I've met people, some of the people that I've been the most challenged by in evangelism
[00:26:09.740 --> 00:26:15.220]   are, you know, again, like very early on, right after I became a Christian, I think
[00:26:15.220 --> 00:26:18.820]   it was either second or third time I ever went street evangelism.
[00:26:18.820 --> 00:26:24.580]   I met a man who was about 86 years old, just standing on the bridge with a pocket full
[00:26:24.580 --> 00:26:29.180]   of tracks, Bible tracks, waiting for somebody to come and stand next to him because he doesn't
[00:26:29.180 --> 00:26:31.420]   have the energy to move around.
[00:26:31.420 --> 00:26:33.940]   So I ended up, cause he was standing on the bridge.
[00:26:33.940 --> 00:26:36.420]   I ended up just trying to share the gospel with him.
[00:26:36.420 --> 00:26:41.580]   And then he waited until about, I was about halfway done, you know, and then he took his,
[00:26:41.580 --> 00:26:45.260]   all his tracks out and he showed it to me and he shared with me what he was doing.
[00:26:45.260 --> 00:26:49.220]   He lived in a nursing home nearby and this is about as far as he can walk.
[00:26:49.220 --> 00:26:52.380]   And he would stand there and this was in Oregon.
[00:26:52.380 --> 00:26:56.380]   He would stand there and wait for some young people to come and stand on the bridge because
[00:26:56.380 --> 00:26:58.980]   that's, it has a really nice view on that bridge.
[00:26:58.980 --> 00:27:01.900]   So he would just stand there until people come and then he would start conversation
[00:27:01.900 --> 00:27:02.900]   and share the gospel with them.
[00:27:02.900 --> 00:27:04.260]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:04.260 --> 00:27:09.540]   And I remember that, that was one of the first, you know, first or second time I was out evangelizing
[00:27:09.540 --> 00:27:12.620]   and that just made a deep impression in my heart.
[00:27:12.620 --> 00:27:13.620]   You know what I mean?
[00:27:13.620 --> 00:27:17.460]   So a lot of times it's like, you know, the inability to do it a lot of times is in our
[00:27:17.460 --> 00:27:20.620]   own head, right?
[00:27:20.620 --> 00:27:24.020]   First Timothy five, one and two, do not rebuke an older man, but encourage him as you would
[00:27:24.020 --> 00:27:27.740]   a father, treat younger men like brothers, older women like mothers, younger women like
[00:27:27.740 --> 00:27:29.540]   sisters in all purity.
[00:27:29.540 --> 00:27:34.140]   And again, in the, in the scriptures, there's descriptions, not simply for young people,
[00:27:34.140 --> 00:27:35.140]   but older people.
[00:27:35.140 --> 00:27:39.980]   So there are times in my life when everybody in my life was at least 10 to 12 years older
[00:27:39.980 --> 00:27:40.980]   than me.
[00:27:40.980 --> 00:27:43.440]   When I was in college, all of my roommates, right?
[00:27:43.440 --> 00:27:46.620]   So they're all now in their early sixties.
[00:27:46.620 --> 00:27:48.380]   My roommates back in college.
[00:27:48.380 --> 00:27:51.480]   And then after I graduated, I became a youth pastor.
[00:27:51.480 --> 00:27:56.780]   So the rest of my life, everybody was younger than me, a lot younger, but there are different
[00:27:56.780 --> 00:28:00.580]   periods in life where you're going to be surrounded by a bunch of younger people, a bunch of older
[00:28:00.580 --> 00:28:04.180]   people and a lot of times with your peers, right?
[00:28:04.180 --> 00:28:11.460]   But the danger that we get into is when we are only looking for our peers, right?
[00:28:11.460 --> 00:28:15.420]   We should be looking for partners for ministry.
[00:28:15.420 --> 00:28:21.560]   So whether they are 15 years younger or 20 years older, if our goal in life is to glorify
[00:28:21.560 --> 00:28:27.120]   God, you can't say you can only glorify God with people between, you know, three or four
[00:28:27.120 --> 00:28:31.600]   years in that middle range, right?
[00:28:31.600 --> 00:28:32.600]   It's good.
[00:28:32.600 --> 00:28:34.760]   I mean, there's nothing wrong with having friends.
[00:28:34.760 --> 00:28:39.280]   There's nothing wrong with that, but that can't be your primary goal.
[00:28:39.280 --> 00:28:43.520]   Your primary goal has to be to glorify God and to partner with him.
[00:28:43.520 --> 00:28:45.840]   So I can partner with somebody who's 19.
[00:28:45.840 --> 00:28:51.280]   I can partner with somebody who's 60 or 70 if we're doing the same thing, right?
[00:28:51.280 --> 00:28:56.360]   So we can't have this mentality that I want to first meet my friends between the age of
[00:28:56.360 --> 00:29:00.360]   25 and 30, and then I'll decide what I'm going to do, right?
[00:29:00.360 --> 00:29:05.000]   No, you're going to, I think our priority should be find partners that we're going to
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:08.260]   be running this race together with, right?
[00:29:08.260 --> 00:29:11.540]   And I guarantee you, if they're on the same page, it's a lot easier to fellowship and
[00:29:11.540 --> 00:29:15.660]   connect with people, whether they're 20 years younger or 20 years older, if you're on the
[00:29:15.660 --> 00:29:17.540]   same page, pursuing the same thing.
[00:29:17.540 --> 00:29:21.780]   You can have a bunch of people exactly the same way, same background, you know, same
[00:29:21.780 --> 00:29:25.380]   culture and have nothing in common.
[00:29:25.380 --> 00:29:29.700]   If your pursuit is Christ, if they're not pursuing it, right?
[00:29:29.700 --> 00:29:34.580]   Every age, I'm not going to read this whole thing, but Titus 2, 1 through 7 talks about
[00:29:34.580 --> 00:29:44.100]   older men and older women and our attitudes, and again, a church should always have as
[00:29:44.100 --> 00:29:48.420]   a goal the whole community, right?
[00:29:48.420 --> 00:29:55.140]   So every once in a while, somebody would ask me, "Who's your target group in ministry?"
[00:29:55.140 --> 00:30:00.260]   I always had a problem answering that question because the target group is whoever comes,
[00:30:00.260 --> 00:30:01.340]   right?
[00:30:01.340 --> 00:30:03.300]   So whoever is in Irvine.
[00:30:03.300 --> 00:30:10.300]   I can't say my target group here is collegians at UCI because that's not the church.
[00:30:10.300 --> 00:30:12.100]   That's a portion of the church.
[00:30:12.100 --> 00:30:14.400]   The church is the whole community, right?
[00:30:14.400 --> 00:30:18.780]   The collegians are a small portion of that, but you can't say my target is just collegians.
[00:30:18.780 --> 00:30:26.140]   My target is just, you know, this age group of people, right?
[00:30:26.140 --> 00:30:27.140]   Every stage of believers.
[00:30:27.140 --> 00:30:30.300]   This is another thing that sometimes people get caught up in, it's like, "Well, I'm just
[00:30:30.300 --> 00:30:31.300]   a new believer.
[00:30:31.300 --> 00:30:34.780]   What can I possibly do?"
[00:30:34.780 --> 00:30:40.620]   Sometimes the best person to reach out to non-Christians is the brand new believer because
[00:30:40.620 --> 00:30:44.460]   your testimony is brand new, and you know what it's like to be a non-believer better
[00:30:44.460 --> 00:30:49.460]   than anybody else because you were just there.
[00:30:49.460 --> 00:30:52.540]   And then what happens to a lot of people who become Christians for a long time is they
[00:30:52.540 --> 00:30:55.060]   get disconnected with the world, right?
[00:30:55.060 --> 00:30:59.620]   And even if you want to evangelize, you don't have any non-Christian friends in your life.
[00:30:59.620 --> 00:31:03.140]   First, you shouldn't be like that, right?
[00:31:03.140 --> 00:31:07.460]   Mature believers should make every effort to be in the world, not be of the world, but
[00:31:07.460 --> 00:31:09.580]   to be in the world, right?
[00:31:09.580 --> 00:31:15.060]   So if you're a student and you have an opportunity to do a project together, don't gravitate
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:17.820]   toward other Christians.
[00:31:17.820 --> 00:31:21.580]   You know, take that opportunity to do projects with non-Christians and interact with them
[00:31:21.580 --> 00:31:23.660]   because that's how you're going to evangelize.
[00:31:23.660 --> 00:31:26.540]   I mean, I've tried every form of evangelism.
[00:31:26.540 --> 00:31:30.140]   Street evangelism, street preaching, you know, going whatever.
[00:31:30.140 --> 00:31:34.180]   I mean, I've tried every form of evangelism that you can possibly think of.
[00:31:34.180 --> 00:31:39.820]   The most effective evangelism is lifestyle evangelism with people that you know.
[00:31:39.820 --> 00:31:40.820]   That's the most effective.
[00:31:40.820 --> 00:31:43.100]   It doesn't mean that it's the only way.
[00:31:43.100 --> 00:31:45.820]   I think street evangelism has its place.
[00:31:45.820 --> 00:31:51.020]   Even street preaching in certain places has its place, but the most effective is always
[00:31:51.020 --> 00:31:54.820]   with the people that you rub shoulders with on a regular basis.
[00:31:54.820 --> 00:31:58.460]   Those are the people who are going to be the most open to you, right?
[00:31:58.460 --> 00:32:02.980]   And so, again, for mature believers, it's our responsibility to make every effort to
[00:32:02.980 --> 00:32:05.380]   engage the non-Christian world.
[00:32:05.380 --> 00:32:10.500]   And also for brand new believers, you're in a position that's probably, you know, best
[00:32:10.500 --> 00:32:13.940]   position to be able to reach the non-Christians, right?
[00:32:13.940 --> 00:32:18.580]   And you know, this one thing that a missionary said always stuck with me is like, "The land
[00:32:18.580 --> 00:32:22.660]   of the blind, one-eyed man is king," right?
[00:32:22.660 --> 00:32:24.460]   If you know what I'm saying.
[00:32:24.460 --> 00:32:27.500]   Like, "The land of the blind, one-eyed man is king."
[00:32:27.500 --> 00:32:34.380]   You don't have to be a PhD in theology to teach a bunch of people who just got their
[00:32:34.380 --> 00:32:37.060]   Bible, right?
[00:32:37.060 --> 00:32:38.860]   The whole world doesn't know Christ.
[00:32:38.860 --> 00:32:41.860]   If you know Christ, you're an expert, right?
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:45.860]   You may not be an expert in the church, but you're an expert in the world, right?
[00:32:45.860 --> 00:32:48.420]   So you're not evangelizing the church.
[00:32:48.420 --> 00:32:50.440]   You're evangelizing the world.
[00:32:50.440 --> 00:32:54.060]   So you know better than everybody else outside the church.
[00:32:54.060 --> 00:32:57.180]   So we can't say, "I'm not prepared.
[00:32:57.180 --> 00:33:01.780]   I'm not trained," because you know better than the other person, okay?
[00:33:01.780 --> 00:33:07.340]   And we need, so that, again, the point of all of this is everybody, with every gift,
[00:33:07.340 --> 00:33:08.420]   right?
[00:33:08.420 --> 00:33:10.940]   How should we evangelize?
[00:33:10.940 --> 00:33:15.140]   This we'll get into a little bit further into our ministry philosophy.
[00:33:15.140 --> 00:33:18.020]   Evangelism should not be approached like an event, but a way of life.
[00:33:18.020 --> 00:33:21.700]   Sorry for the tiny words, but that's what it says.
[00:33:21.700 --> 00:33:25.820]   Evangelism should not be approached like an event, but a way of life.
[00:33:25.820 --> 00:33:28.780]   Typically, we ask questions like, "Do we do evangelism?"
[00:33:28.780 --> 00:33:32.700]   I mean, that's a legitimate question, right?
[00:33:32.700 --> 00:33:37.740]   But evangelism shouldn't be an event that we do Thursday night at three o'clock, right?
[00:33:37.740 --> 00:33:44.180]   In fact, the term that we should be using are, "Are you a witness?"
[00:33:44.180 --> 00:33:45.180]   Are you a witness?
[00:33:45.180 --> 00:33:49.940]   And if you're a witness, witnessinging happens 24/7, right?
[00:33:49.940 --> 00:33:51.060]   It happens 24/7.
[00:33:51.060 --> 00:33:53.980]   Every opportunity we get, we try to be a witness.
[00:33:53.980 --> 00:34:01.980]   But when we turn witnessing to an event on campus on Tuesday between 12 and 1, once we
[00:34:01.980 --> 00:34:03.620]   did it, we're done.
[00:34:03.620 --> 00:34:05.820]   I did evangelism, right?
[00:34:05.820 --> 00:34:07.580]   Again, there's a place for that.
[00:34:07.580 --> 00:34:09.700]   I'm not saying that there isn't a place for that.
[00:34:09.700 --> 00:34:15.900]   But primary form of evangelism, the most effective form of evangelism, is lifestyle, right?
[00:34:15.900 --> 00:34:16.900]   That we are a witness.
[00:34:16.900 --> 00:34:18.100]   We're not just witnessing.
[00:34:18.100 --> 00:34:23.340]   We are a witness, right?
[00:34:23.340 --> 00:34:30.260]   The Word of God is the primary avenue in which the Gospel and the Church is established,
[00:34:30.260 --> 00:34:31.260]   right?
[00:34:31.260 --> 00:34:34.620]   I apologize about the small letters.
[00:34:34.620 --> 00:34:39.700]   I even tried to make it bigger, and this is how it came out.
[00:34:39.700 --> 00:34:45.380]   The Word of God must be preached in season and out of season, right?
[00:34:45.380 --> 00:34:49.900]   Romans 10, 17, so faith comes from hearing and the hearing through the Word of Christ.
[00:34:49.900 --> 00:34:56.600]   So if you want to be properly trained in evangelism, the most beneficial thing that you could do
[00:34:56.600 --> 00:34:59.580]   is know the Word of God, right?
[00:34:59.580 --> 00:35:02.340]   Know what the Word of God says, right?
[00:35:02.340 --> 00:35:06.740]   That's the best, because that's the primary avenue in which somebody comes to Christ.
[00:35:06.740 --> 00:35:13.380]   So if you're great at talking to people, but not great at leading them to the Word, then,
[00:35:13.380 --> 00:35:17.260]   you know, I remember in seminary, I heard this story.
[00:35:17.260 --> 00:35:21.340]   This is when the Seeker Friendly Movement was just coming in, and I remember this lady
[00:35:21.340 --> 00:35:28.500]   was sharing a story about a good friend of hers that ended up walking away from her faith.
[00:35:28.500 --> 00:35:31.060]   And the reason why was she accepted Christ.
[00:35:31.060 --> 00:35:34.340]   If somebody doing evangelism, the Church had all these events and outreach things, and
[00:35:34.340 --> 00:35:40.220]   then she became a Christian and came into the Church, and then she heard the evangelism
[00:35:40.220 --> 00:35:46.140]   training that they were having, how to market the Gospel and finding out what their needs
[00:35:46.140 --> 00:35:49.580]   are and meet their felt needs and then target them at that particular time.
[00:35:49.580 --> 00:35:52.580]   And they were doing all these different techniques.
[00:35:52.580 --> 00:35:57.940]   And then she, again, true or not, she felt like she was duped.
[00:35:57.940 --> 00:36:05.060]   If they used that technique to target my heart, then maybe my response wasn't genuine.
[00:36:05.060 --> 00:36:07.940]   That's what she started thinking.
[00:36:07.940 --> 00:36:09.780]   And again, we can't just blame that on the Church.
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.420]   I mean, if her faith wasn't genuine, it wasn't genuine.
[00:36:12.420 --> 00:36:19.460]   But when she found out the techniques that the Church used to get her to accept Christ,
[00:36:19.460 --> 00:36:24.820]   it basically cheapened her experience, that it wasn't genuine.
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:27.940]   And I remember back in seminary, listening to that, thinking, "Yeah, I mean, that's
[00:36:27.940 --> 00:36:31.940]   exactly how people would feel if that's how they came."
[00:36:31.940 --> 00:36:35.380]   It's like, "Oh, we're going to target them and make dinner for them every Tuesday night,
[00:36:35.380 --> 00:36:39.380]   and then if they do that, maybe they'll be more receptive, and then we're going to pounce
[00:36:39.380 --> 00:36:40.380]   when they're suffering."
[00:36:40.380 --> 00:36:41.380]   And then, you know what I mean?
[00:36:41.380 --> 00:36:48.660]   And imagine hearing all of that years later and thinking like, "Huh, it was all just marketing."
[00:36:48.660 --> 00:36:50.420]   You know what I mean?
[00:36:50.420 --> 00:36:53.860]   And then they start questioning whether their faith was genuine.
[00:36:53.860 --> 00:36:58.740]   So primary form is, again, it's foolishness to those who are perishing, but it's a power
[00:36:58.740 --> 00:37:03.580]   of God for those who are being saved.
[00:37:03.580 --> 00:37:07.860]   He said to him, "If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be convinced
[00:37:07.860 --> 00:37:11.980]   if someone should rise from the dead, that even if they see miraculous things, if they
[00:37:11.980 --> 00:37:17.860]   do not pay attention to the ordained Word of God, they won't respond."
[00:37:17.860 --> 00:37:23.980]   This is Jesus' words.
[00:37:23.980 --> 00:37:27.020]   Preach the Word, be ready in season and out of season.
[00:37:27.020 --> 00:37:29.020]   In season and out of season.
[00:37:29.020 --> 00:37:30.500]   That's the part that always sticks with me.
[00:37:30.500 --> 00:37:34.380]   In season, where they respond, out of season, where they don't respond.
[00:37:34.380 --> 00:37:35.980]   Whether they thank you or don't thank you.
[00:37:35.980 --> 00:37:38.980]   Whether it seems to bear fruit, doesn't seem to bear fruit.
[00:37:38.980 --> 00:37:39.980]   Stick with the Word.
[00:37:39.980 --> 00:37:40.980]   Right?
[00:37:40.980 --> 00:37:43.180]   And there's always seasons.
[00:37:43.180 --> 00:37:47.340]   There's nothing that you're going to do in life that if you do that, the same result
[00:37:47.340 --> 00:37:50.140]   is going to happen every single time.
[00:37:50.140 --> 00:37:51.140]   Nothing.
[00:37:51.140 --> 00:37:52.140]   Right?
[00:37:52.140 --> 00:37:57.260]   Nothing you do in life will be—you'll get the exact same result every single time.
[00:37:57.260 --> 00:37:58.740]   You don't.
[00:37:58.740 --> 00:38:00.000]   Right?
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:03.040]   So in preaching, there are seasons.
[00:38:03.040 --> 00:38:04.900]   Sometimes it's winter.
[00:38:04.900 --> 00:38:06.440]   Sometimes it's harvest.
[00:38:06.440 --> 00:38:07.940]   Sometimes it's spring.
[00:38:07.940 --> 00:38:08.940]   Sometimes it's fall.
[00:38:08.940 --> 00:38:15.900]   But if you're preaching and all you're looking for is summer and harvest, and then, "Oh,
[00:38:15.900 --> 00:38:16.900]   maybe it's not preaching."
[00:38:16.900 --> 00:38:17.900]   Right?
[00:38:17.900 --> 00:38:22.820]   "Maybe we should stop watering because I just watered today and there's no fruit.
[00:38:22.820 --> 00:38:27.180]   Maybe what we should be doing is digging or doing something."
[00:38:27.180 --> 00:38:28.180]   You know what I'm saying?
[00:38:28.360 --> 00:38:32.120]   No, you water, you water, and you water because you know that the watering ultimately leads
[00:38:32.120 --> 00:38:34.160]   to the harvest.
[00:38:34.160 --> 00:38:35.380]   Right?
[00:38:35.380 --> 00:38:36.820]   So it may not be in season.
[00:38:36.820 --> 00:38:39.200]   That's why it says in season and out of season.
[00:38:39.200 --> 00:38:46.180]   God has ordained the preaching of His Word to bear fruit.
[00:38:46.180 --> 00:38:50.440]   All scripture is breathed out by God and proffered for teaching, for reproof, for correction,
[00:38:50.440 --> 00:38:51.440]   training, righteousness.
[00:38:51.440 --> 00:38:52.440]   For what?
[00:38:52.440 --> 00:38:55.480]   That the man of God may be competent, equipped for every good work.
[00:38:55.480 --> 00:38:56.480]   Every good work.
[00:38:56.480 --> 00:39:02.360]   And that's referring to evangelism, bringing the gospel to the world.
[00:39:02.360 --> 00:39:03.920]   Right?
[00:39:03.920 --> 00:39:10.160]   So if you want to be trained as an evangelist, right, before you learn apologetics, before
[00:39:10.160 --> 00:39:16.640]   you learn about the latest arguments, the ontological argument, the cause and effect
[00:39:16.640 --> 00:39:19.680]   argument, I'm not saying those have no any place.
[00:39:19.680 --> 00:39:24.720]   I'm saying before that, our primary place that we need to commit to is God's Word.
[00:39:24.720 --> 00:39:25.720]   Right?
[00:39:25.720 --> 00:39:36.200]   Then ultimately, by shining the light of Christ through our lives.
[00:39:36.200 --> 00:39:40.720]   We can be very effective evangelists and sharing the gospel and doing all this stuff if they
[00:39:40.720 --> 00:39:43.160]   see the church as hypocrites.
[00:39:43.160 --> 00:39:44.160]   They don't care.
[00:39:44.160 --> 00:39:45.160]   Right?
[00:39:45.160 --> 00:39:50.880]   I mean, even if they're curious, they'll shut down that curiosity if they don't respect
[00:39:50.880 --> 00:39:51.880]   the church.
[00:39:51.880 --> 00:39:52.880]   Right?
[00:39:52.880 --> 00:39:59.080]   I'm not saying we should fake it, but if our lives don't match the things that we proclaim,
[00:39:59.080 --> 00:40:01.600]   it nullifies everything we have to say.
[00:40:01.600 --> 00:40:02.680]   Right?
[00:40:02.680 --> 00:40:04.800]   So God calls us to be the light.
[00:40:04.800 --> 00:40:05.800]   Right?
[00:40:05.800 --> 00:40:09.400]   In the same way, let your light shine before others so that they may see your good works
[00:40:09.400 --> 00:40:13.920]   and give glory to your Father who is in heaven.
[00:40:13.920 --> 00:40:16.920]   Right?
[00:40:16.920 --> 00:40:20.320]   Do all things without grumbling or questioning that you may be blameless and innocent children
[00:40:20.320 --> 00:40:24.840]   of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and twisted generation among whom you shine
[00:40:24.840 --> 00:40:27.840]   as lights in the world, holding fast to the Word of life.
[00:40:27.840 --> 00:40:28.840]   Right?
[00:40:28.840 --> 00:40:30.880]   So our life does matter.
[00:40:30.880 --> 00:40:34.440]   And I, you know, every once in a while I'll hear somebody say, "Well, God uses donkeys."
[00:40:34.440 --> 00:40:35.440]   Right?
[00:40:35.440 --> 00:40:39.200]   Yeah, he uses donkeys, but God didn't call you to be a donkey.
[00:40:39.200 --> 00:40:40.200]   Right?
[00:40:40.200 --> 00:40:41.880]   God called us to be the light.
[00:40:41.880 --> 00:40:42.880]   Right?
[00:40:42.880 --> 00:40:43.880]   God can use rocks.
[00:40:43.880 --> 00:40:46.600]   God can use anybody if he wanted to.
[00:40:46.600 --> 00:40:49.480]   He even used Judas.
[00:40:49.480 --> 00:40:50.920]   Right?
[00:40:50.920 --> 00:40:53.480]   But does that mean that God is okay with us being Judas?
[00:40:53.480 --> 00:40:54.920]   Of course not.
[00:40:54.920 --> 00:40:56.920]   God wants us to be the light.
[00:40:56.920 --> 00:40:57.920]   Right?
[00:40:57.920 --> 00:41:00.360]   If we want to be used for noble purposes, what does he say?
[00:41:00.360 --> 00:41:01.360]   Right?
[00:41:01.360 --> 00:41:02.680]   Get rid of ignoble things.
[00:41:02.680 --> 00:41:03.680]   Right?
[00:41:03.680 --> 00:41:05.840]   So that we be prepared for every good thing.
[00:41:05.840 --> 00:41:10.480]   Okay, I'm not going to go through this.
[00:41:10.480 --> 00:41:12.840]   I went through this, I think, in the very beginning.
[00:41:12.840 --> 00:41:13.840]   Right?
[00:41:13.840 --> 00:41:14.840]   Man-centered revenge.
[00:41:14.840 --> 00:41:15.840]   I'm just going to read it.
[00:41:15.840 --> 00:41:18.880]   Man-centered evangelism attempts to make the Gospel the most attractive to most people
[00:41:18.880 --> 00:41:21.800]   because their primary goal is to get people in.
[00:41:21.800 --> 00:41:25.680]   God-centered evangelism focuses on representing God and his message accurately.
[00:41:25.680 --> 00:41:26.680]   Right?
[00:41:26.680 --> 00:41:32.080]   Because we believe that true fruit is going to come from careful and accurate presentation
[00:41:32.080 --> 00:41:35.120]   of the Word of God.
[00:41:35.120 --> 00:41:37.360]   Man-centered evangelism ends, justifies, any means.
[00:41:37.360 --> 00:41:42.760]   So if getting them through the door is the primary goal, do whatever it takes to get
[00:41:42.760 --> 00:41:43.760]   them in.
[00:41:43.760 --> 00:41:44.960]   Right?
[00:41:44.960 --> 00:41:46.440]   So that's where the marketing comes in.
[00:41:46.440 --> 00:41:49.720]   How do we get these people to take this product and make it theirs?
[00:41:49.720 --> 00:41:50.720]   That's man-centered.
[00:41:50.720 --> 00:41:55.280]   God-centered evangelism emphasizes the fact that God has ordained the means as well as
[00:41:55.280 --> 00:41:58.480]   the ends to bring about salvation of his elect.
[00:41:58.480 --> 00:42:02.960]   So always remember, even Jesus wasn't fruitful everywhere.
[00:42:02.960 --> 00:42:04.680]   Not by human standard.
[00:42:04.680 --> 00:42:05.760]   Right?
[00:42:05.760 --> 00:42:08.160]   Jesus was rejected.
[00:42:08.160 --> 00:42:12.400]   The three years of ministry, the majority of the people who saw his miracles rejected
[00:42:12.400 --> 00:42:13.400]   him.
[00:42:13.400 --> 00:42:16.640]   So we think that if we follow this pattern, that we're going to bear fruit in this way
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.600]   all the time, he's going to get us in trouble.
[00:42:19.600 --> 00:42:20.600]   Right?
[00:42:20.600 --> 00:42:24.200]   He's ordained the means as well as the ends.
[00:42:24.200 --> 00:42:27.240]   Man-centered evangelism focuses on simply confession.
[00:42:27.240 --> 00:42:28.440]   Right?
[00:42:28.440 --> 00:42:33.000]   God-centered evangelism focuses on conversion.
[00:42:33.000 --> 00:42:34.840]   True followers of Christ.
[00:42:34.840 --> 00:42:37.480]   All right.
[00:42:37.480 --> 00:42:43.720]   When should we evangelize?
[00:42:43.720 --> 00:42:48.240]   There is nothing more we need to carry out God's plan of salvation.
[00:42:48.240 --> 00:42:52.760]   Everything that we need for life of godliness has been given to us in the knowledge of his
[00:42:52.760 --> 00:42:54.760]   son.
[00:42:54.760 --> 00:42:56.400]   Right?
[00:42:56.400 --> 00:42:59.640]   Meaning, the ball's on our end.
[00:42:59.640 --> 00:43:00.640]   Right?
[00:43:00.640 --> 00:43:03.320]   We're not here waiting for God to do something.
[00:43:03.320 --> 00:43:06.200]   He says, "No, God's saying you do something."
[00:43:06.200 --> 00:43:09.240]   Everything that you need to act has been given to you.
[00:43:09.240 --> 00:43:12.280]   You've been given the word, you've been given the Holy Spirit.
[00:43:12.280 --> 00:43:13.280]   Right?
[00:43:13.280 --> 00:43:16.960]   So when we come before God, like, "Give me, like I'm waiting for God to do something so
[00:43:16.960 --> 00:43:17.960]   that I can do something."
[00:43:17.960 --> 00:43:18.960]   Right?
[00:43:18.960 --> 00:43:24.440]   So we say, "Well, everything that you need has been given to you, so what are you waiting
[00:43:24.440 --> 00:43:25.440]   for?"
[00:43:25.440 --> 00:43:32.960]   There's, it might be that our motivation is lacking.
[00:43:32.960 --> 00:43:34.320]   Right?
[00:43:34.320 --> 00:43:38.400]   Not because God didn't answer our prayers or God's not doing something.
[00:43:38.400 --> 00:43:39.400]   Right?
[00:43:39.400 --> 00:43:42.440]   It's because we've given our energy to other things.
[00:43:42.440 --> 00:43:43.440]   Right?
[00:43:43.440 --> 00:43:48.680]   Maybe there's a lack of appetite for God because that appetite that God gave you for him was
[00:43:48.680 --> 00:43:51.160]   satisfied with something else.
[00:43:51.160 --> 00:43:54.560]   And we're waiting for God to do something and God's saying, "No, everything that you
[00:43:54.560 --> 00:43:56.600]   need has been given to you."
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:43:57.800]   Right?
[00:43:57.800 --> 00:44:05.040]   And sometimes, sometimes the best thing that we can do is to obey and act.
[00:44:05.040 --> 00:44:07.720]   Right?
[00:44:07.720 --> 00:44:10.880]   Now is the favorable time, behold now is the day of salvation.
[00:44:10.880 --> 00:44:15.320]   When he says now, okay, and I want you to understand, Paul is not simply talking about
[00:44:15.320 --> 00:44:17.520]   now as in that particular time.
[00:44:17.520 --> 00:44:25.360]   Now meaning everything that God has been preparing to bring salvation to mankind has been finished.
[00:44:25.360 --> 00:44:26.440]   Right?
[00:44:26.440 --> 00:44:29.520]   So we are at the end times.
[00:44:29.520 --> 00:44:31.440]   Right?
[00:44:31.440 --> 00:44:37.040]   So when he says now is the favorable time, meaning that we're not waiting for the Messiah,
[00:44:37.040 --> 00:44:42.440]   we're not waiting for the Son of God to be revealed, for his death, his resurrection,
[00:44:42.440 --> 00:44:44.520]   we're not waiting for the Holy Spirit to be given.
[00:44:44.520 --> 00:44:47.500]   He said everything has been given, it is finished.
[00:44:47.500 --> 00:44:49.600]   So he says now is the favorable time.
[00:44:49.600 --> 00:44:53.680]   There's nothing for us to wait for other than the final judgment.
[00:44:53.680 --> 00:44:56.180]   Right?
[00:44:56.180 --> 00:44:59.600]   He was foreknown before the foundation of the world but was made manifest in the last
[00:44:59.600 --> 00:45:00.880]   times for your sake.
[00:45:00.880 --> 00:45:03.200]   And so we're living in the last times.
[00:45:03.200 --> 00:45:04.440]   Right?
[00:45:04.440 --> 00:45:09.520]   We're not supposed to be waiting for another revival, another thing to come.
[00:45:09.520 --> 00:45:11.320]   Everything has been given to us.
[00:45:11.320 --> 00:45:15.340]   Finally brothers, pray for us that the word of the Lord may speed ahead and be honored
[00:45:15.340 --> 00:45:17.160]   as happened among you.
[00:45:17.160 --> 00:45:18.160]   Right?
[00:45:18.160 --> 00:45:20.920]   That this should be the attitude of every Christian.
[00:45:20.920 --> 00:45:26.080]   To not just kind of, you know what, when I'm not in school anymore, you know, when my children
[00:45:26.080 --> 00:45:30.560]   are a bit older, or when my business is a little bit, you know, settled down, or make
[00:45:30.560 --> 00:45:34.200]   this kind of money, or you know, when I'm not so busy.
[00:45:34.200 --> 00:45:35.200]   Right?
[00:45:35.200 --> 00:45:41.380]   He said, at least in prayer, right, and it is in mentality that we, this is something
[00:45:41.380 --> 00:45:42.840]   that God calls us to do.
[00:45:42.840 --> 00:45:47.300]   This should be our priority.
[00:45:47.300 --> 00:45:50.040]   And ultimately we are called to be good stewards of our time.
[00:45:50.040 --> 00:45:51.520]   Colossians 4.5.
[00:45:51.520 --> 00:45:58.160]   Direct yourselves wisely toward outsiders, making the best use of time.
[00:45:58.160 --> 00:46:04.320]   So the opportunities that you have, you know, sometimes, I know a lot of you guys envy my
[00:46:04.320 --> 00:46:05.320]   job.
[00:46:05.320 --> 00:46:08.040]   It's like, oh, I would like to wake up and read the Bible all day and just fellowship
[00:46:08.040 --> 00:46:09.040]   with people.
[00:46:09.040 --> 00:46:10.040]   Awesome.
[00:46:10.040 --> 00:46:11.040]   It is awesome.
[00:46:11.040 --> 00:46:12.040]   Right?
[00:46:12.040 --> 00:46:13.480]   Sometimes I envy you.
[00:46:13.480 --> 00:46:17.360]   And the reason why I envy you is because you're surrounded by non-Christians all the time.
[00:46:17.360 --> 00:46:18.360]   Right?
[00:46:18.360 --> 00:46:23.480]   You're surrounded by non-Christians all the time, and you have every opportunity, right,
[00:46:23.480 --> 00:46:27.520]   and to be able to share the gospel with them, and go out and lunch with them, interact with
[00:46:27.520 --> 00:46:28.520]   them.
[00:46:28.520 --> 00:46:32.160]   In order for me to do that, I've got to go on campus and get awkward looks from students.
[00:46:32.160 --> 00:46:39.120]   Or go to the coffee shop and be a creeper.
[00:46:39.120 --> 00:46:43.840]   So I, sometimes I envy, you know, that you have, that you're out there and you're with
[00:46:43.840 --> 00:46:45.320]   non-Christians all the time.
[00:46:45.320 --> 00:46:47.680]   But he said, every opportunity that you get.
[00:46:47.680 --> 00:46:51.760]   You know, there's a good part of being a pastor too in evangelism because sometimes they'll
[00:46:51.760 --> 00:46:54.280]   open, they'll just open up to me.
[00:46:54.280 --> 00:46:58.200]   Tell them I'm a pastor and they just kind of like, like, I don't know what it is.
[00:46:58.200 --> 00:47:01.720]   Maybe they grew up Catholic and they just start confessing.
[00:47:01.720 --> 00:47:04.280]   I've had that happen to me on the metro.
[00:47:04.280 --> 00:47:08.040]   You know, this guy looked like he just came out of jail.
[00:47:08.040 --> 00:47:11.400]   And then I, literally, he's the kind of guy that you wouldn't sit next to.
[00:47:11.400 --> 00:47:12.800]   I mean, he's a rough looking guy.
[00:47:12.800 --> 00:47:15.600]   And I went up to him and tried to share the gospel with him.
[00:47:15.600 --> 00:47:16.600]   And he just started bawling.
[00:47:16.600 --> 00:47:20.960]   And he just started, for about an hour and a half, I was on the train with him telling
[00:47:20.960 --> 00:47:25.520]   me about how his wife cheated on him and all this stuff.
[00:47:25.520 --> 00:47:29.080]   But again, that kind of stuff happened because, you know, I'm a pastor.
[00:47:29.080 --> 00:47:30.600]   So there's a benefit of that too.
[00:47:30.600 --> 00:47:33.080]   But again, because I'm not out there all the time.
[00:47:33.080 --> 00:47:34.080]   Right.
[00:47:34.080 --> 00:47:37.440]   But, you know, be wise with what you have.
[00:47:37.440 --> 00:47:41.440]   Probably opportunities are all around you if you are, if you just open your eyes.
[00:47:41.440 --> 00:47:42.440]   Right.
[00:47:42.440 --> 00:47:46.440]   If you have a fertile heart that is eager, you know, you don't need to be going out and
[00:47:46.440 --> 00:47:47.440]   going to coffee shop.
[00:47:47.440 --> 00:47:51.560]   I bet you they're around you.
[00:47:51.560 --> 00:47:56.000]   Look carefully then how you walk, not as unwise, but wise, making the best use of time because
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:47:57.000]   the days are evil.
[00:47:57.000 --> 00:47:58.000]   Right.
[00:47:58.000 --> 00:48:01.880]   Again, the older I get, the more precious time becomes.
[00:48:01.880 --> 00:48:02.880]   Right.
[00:48:02.880 --> 00:48:07.720]   Money, sometimes you get a lot and you lose, it comes and goes.
[00:48:07.720 --> 00:48:09.720]   Sometimes you get a lot, sometimes you don't.
[00:48:09.720 --> 00:48:12.280]   Time, once it passes, it's the end.
[00:48:12.280 --> 00:48:13.560]   Right.
[00:48:13.560 --> 00:48:18.040]   So when you're single, it's like you're always, I mean, it's not just singles, like every
[00:48:18.040 --> 00:48:22.240]   stage in life you're at, you're always looking to the next stage.
[00:48:22.240 --> 00:48:23.240]   Right.
[00:48:23.240 --> 00:48:26.480]   You're always looking to the next stage and then that looking to the next stage causes
[00:48:26.480 --> 00:48:28.960]   you to be ineffective where you are now.
[00:48:28.960 --> 00:48:30.280]   Right.
[00:48:30.280 --> 00:48:33.800]   There's things that you can only do as a single that you can't do.
[00:48:33.800 --> 00:48:37.960]   Ask the married guys that you can't do once you get married.
[00:48:37.960 --> 00:48:40.680]   And that's an opportunity that's never going to come back.
[00:48:40.680 --> 00:48:45.840]   There's things that you can only do as a young couple that don't have kids.
[00:48:45.840 --> 00:48:47.280]   Right.
[00:48:47.280 --> 00:48:51.400]   There's only things that you can do because you don't have kids.
[00:48:51.400 --> 00:48:52.820]   Make every opportunity.
[00:48:52.820 --> 00:48:56.640]   And there's only things that you can do when your children are young.
[00:48:56.640 --> 00:48:59.400]   And when they get past that age, you can't do that.
[00:48:59.400 --> 00:49:00.400]   Right.
[00:49:00.400 --> 00:49:05.100]   So every stage in life, there's things that are uniquely gifted to you.
[00:49:05.100 --> 00:49:10.080]   But if you see that as a burden, just waiting for you to be delivered to the next stage,
[00:49:10.080 --> 00:49:13.760]   that stage is going to have another burden that you're waiting to be delivered by.
[00:49:13.760 --> 00:49:16.520]   And then you're going to end up spending the rest of your life thinking that way.
[00:49:16.520 --> 00:49:17.520]   Right.
[00:49:17.520 --> 00:49:19.600]   Every stage of life has something unique.
[00:49:19.600 --> 00:49:24.680]   And there's people around you that need to, you know, need to hear the gospel that you
[00:49:24.680 --> 00:49:25.760]   may be the best person.
[00:49:25.760 --> 00:49:26.760]   You are in that stage.
[00:49:26.760 --> 00:49:27.760]   Right.
[00:49:27.760 --> 00:49:36.400]   Paul says, "I will stay in Ephesus until Pentecost for a wide door for effective work
[00:49:36.400 --> 00:49:37.800]   is opened to me.
[00:49:37.800 --> 00:49:39.440]   And there are many adversaries."
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:40.440]   Okay.
[00:49:40.440 --> 00:49:45.120]   And I want to share a little bit about our church philosophy in the way we do missions.
[00:49:45.120 --> 00:49:49.520]   People ask me all the time, like, "Did you have a heart for China?
[00:49:49.520 --> 00:49:52.160]   Did God give you a special heart for India?"
[00:49:52.160 --> 00:49:53.160]   No.
[00:49:53.160 --> 00:49:54.160]   Okay.
[00:49:54.160 --> 00:49:59.560]   The reason why we started going to China is because the door was opened and there was
[00:49:59.560 --> 00:50:01.320]   a need.
[00:50:01.320 --> 00:50:04.720]   And I happened to be an ESL teacher at that time for five years and wondering, "What
[00:50:04.720 --> 00:50:05.720]   am I going to do with this?"
[00:50:05.720 --> 00:50:07.080]   And the door opened.
[00:50:07.080 --> 00:50:10.560]   And I remember, those of you who were with us in the very beginning of China, remember
[00:50:10.560 --> 00:50:15.400]   I shared with you guys many times, you know, like, it's not for me to pick and choose,
[00:50:15.400 --> 00:50:17.640]   like, "Well, these people, I don't even, I have a heart for these.
[00:50:17.640 --> 00:50:19.200]   I don't have a heart for those people."
[00:50:19.200 --> 00:50:23.080]   I have a heart for, we should have a heart for whoever God has a heart for.
[00:50:23.080 --> 00:50:24.080]   Right?
[00:50:24.080 --> 00:50:27.600]   India is a very strange place, you know.
[00:50:27.600 --> 00:50:30.240]   And I talk to people and it's like, "Oh, that's, you know, I don't like going to India
[00:50:30.240 --> 00:50:32.040]   because everything's so strange."
[00:50:32.040 --> 00:50:33.760]   Yeah, it is strange.
[00:50:33.760 --> 00:50:38.520]   And really it is very, you know, unlike the United States.
[00:50:38.520 --> 00:50:41.000]   Then why are you still wanting to go to India?
[00:50:41.000 --> 00:50:44.560]   Because there's a lot of unreached people in India.
[00:50:44.560 --> 00:50:45.560]   And that's it.
[00:50:45.560 --> 00:50:46.980]   That's the only reason.
[00:50:46.980 --> 00:50:49.040]   If the door gets shut, we won't be going.
[00:50:49.040 --> 00:50:50.040]   Right?
[00:50:50.040 --> 00:50:53.920]   So we're committed because there's a need and that's the only reason.
[00:50:53.920 --> 00:50:57.640]   And if there's a need and we move forward, since I've been going out, this is like my
[00:50:57.640 --> 00:51:00.760]   fifth time going out, I think this January.
[00:51:00.760 --> 00:51:04.500]   God has been growing my heart for them.
[00:51:04.500 --> 00:51:06.880]   But I didn't go there because I had a heart for them.
[00:51:06.880 --> 00:51:09.000]   I went there because the door was open.
[00:51:09.000 --> 00:51:10.000]   Right?
[00:51:10.000 --> 00:51:11.760]   And I think evangelism is no different.
[00:51:11.760 --> 00:51:15.360]   If we target people we have a heart for, a lot of times you're not going to have a heart
[00:51:15.360 --> 00:51:17.360]   for anybody.
[00:51:17.360 --> 00:51:19.320]   Right?
[00:51:19.320 --> 00:51:22.440]   God will give you the heart as you obey.
[00:51:22.440 --> 00:51:23.840]   God will give you what you need.
[00:51:23.840 --> 00:51:24.840]   Right?
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.760]   God doesn't make you the best parent before you have kids.
[00:51:27.760 --> 00:51:31.880]   God will give you the strength to stay up all night after you have the kids.
[00:51:31.880 --> 00:51:33.040]   Not before.
[00:51:33.040 --> 00:51:35.560]   God will give you the strength when you have the kids.
[00:51:35.560 --> 00:51:36.600]   Right?
[00:51:36.600 --> 00:51:37.960]   So that's typically how it works.
[00:51:37.960 --> 00:51:41.280]   When you obey, God will give you the strength.
[00:51:41.280 --> 00:51:42.280]   Right?
[00:51:42.280 --> 00:51:45.880]   If you're waiting for God to do something for me to move, God's like, "I've already given
[00:51:45.880 --> 00:51:46.880]   you everything.
[00:51:46.880 --> 00:51:48.840]   You need to move so that I can come alongside."
[00:51:48.840 --> 00:51:49.840]   Right?
[00:51:49.840 --> 00:51:50.840]   All right.
[00:51:50.840 --> 00:51:51.840]   Okay.
[00:51:51.840 --> 00:51:54.920]   There's a lot more but I'm just going to end it with this.
[00:51:54.920 --> 00:51:58.160]   And let me just explain the discussion questions real quick.
[00:51:58.160 --> 00:52:03.280]   Is there someone you have been praying for to come to Christ for a long time?
[00:52:03.280 --> 00:52:06.640]   If so, how have you tried to share the gospel with them in the past and what did you learn
[00:52:06.640 --> 00:52:07.640]   from those attempts?
[00:52:07.640 --> 00:52:08.640]   Right?
[00:52:08.640 --> 00:52:09.640]   Were you successful?
[00:52:09.640 --> 00:52:11.280]   Were you not successful?
[00:52:11.280 --> 00:52:14.040]   What are some things that you said or didn't say?
[00:52:14.040 --> 00:52:20.000]   Maybe you can glean wisdom from each other in the way that you approach somebody and
[00:52:20.000 --> 00:52:22.200]   kind of take some time to share about that.
[00:52:22.200 --> 00:52:28.920]   What is the biggest fear in sharing the gospel with people you are familiar with and acquaintances
[00:52:28.920 --> 00:52:29.920]   around you?
[00:52:29.920 --> 00:52:30.920]   Okay.
[00:52:30.920 --> 00:52:34.340]   So this one is for people that, again, typically we have a harder time sharing with people
[00:52:34.340 --> 00:52:36.840]   that we've become familiar with.
[00:52:36.840 --> 00:52:41.080]   And it's almost easier to share the gospel with strangers than with those people, like
[00:52:41.080 --> 00:52:42.920]   family members, coworkers.
[00:52:42.920 --> 00:52:48.960]   So what is the biggest drawback to that and how can we encourage each other to have courage
[00:52:48.960 --> 00:52:49.960]   to do that?
[00:52:49.960 --> 00:52:50.960]   Okay.
[00:52:50.960 --> 00:52:54.360]   And third, who is the one person that you haven't shared the gospel with that you would
[00:52:54.360 --> 00:52:56.760]   like to have an opportunity to share with?
[00:52:56.760 --> 00:53:00.520]   Take some time to consider practical steps that you can take to implement your plans
[00:53:00.520 --> 00:53:02.800]   and pray for each other to keep one another accountable.
[00:53:02.800 --> 00:53:07.960]   So this is somebody that if you had one opportunity to share the gospel, is there somebody that
[00:53:07.960 --> 00:53:08.960]   you're thinking of?
[00:53:08.960 --> 00:53:11.000]   You haven't shared with them yet.
[00:53:11.000 --> 00:53:14.940]   And again, this is not just to think about it, but to make practical plans.
[00:53:14.940 --> 00:53:18.340]   Even if it's just giving them a note, even if it is, you know, I want to invite them
[00:53:18.340 --> 00:53:22.120]   to the Christmas service so that they can hear the gospel.
[00:53:22.120 --> 00:53:27.240]   Make a tangible plan so that you can implement this as an application.
[00:53:27.240 --> 00:53:28.240]   Okay.
[00:53:28.240 --> 00:53:30.200]   So let me pray for us and then I'll leave you to your discussion.
[00:53:30.200 --> 00:53:40.200]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
