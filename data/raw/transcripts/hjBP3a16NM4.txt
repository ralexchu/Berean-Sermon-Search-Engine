[00:04:47.100 --> 00:05:02.940]   - Good morning, church family.
[00:05:02.940 --> 00:05:04.380]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:05:04.380 --> 00:05:06.500]   Hope you all had a fulfilling week.
[00:05:06.500 --> 00:05:10.220]   We will start off our service with an older simple song,
[00:05:10.220 --> 00:05:12.220]   a declaration of God's greatness
[00:05:12.220 --> 00:05:15.660]   and a praise of gratitude for what He's done in our lives.
[00:05:15.660 --> 00:05:17.820]   And I pray for us that through any season,
[00:05:17.820 --> 00:05:20.180]   no matter how easy or difficult,
[00:05:20.180 --> 00:05:22.700]   we would rejoice and remain thankful to the Lord
[00:05:22.700 --> 00:05:26.420]   for our joy and gratitude is not circumstantial,
[00:05:26.420 --> 00:05:29.540]   but rests on our unchanging and unfailing God.
[00:05:29.540 --> 00:05:31.820]   1 Thessalonians 5 reads,
[00:05:31.820 --> 00:05:33.620]   "Rejoice always, pray continually,
[00:05:33.620 --> 00:05:35.380]   "and give thanks in all circumstances,
[00:05:35.380 --> 00:05:38.540]   "for this is God's will for you in Christ Jesus."

[00:09:42.180 --> 00:09:46.900]   - All right, good morning.
[00:09:46.900 --> 00:09:48.780]   Welcome to Brain Community Church.
[00:09:48.780 --> 00:09:51.260]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:09:51.260 --> 00:09:52.580]   First of all, as you guys know,
[00:09:52.580 --> 00:09:54.540]   next Sunday is Mother's Day,
[00:09:54.540 --> 00:09:59.500]   and so our logistics team has photo booths,
[00:09:59.500 --> 00:10:01.060]   and there's some gifts set up for the moms.
[00:10:01.060 --> 00:10:02.220]   So if you are a mom,
[00:10:02.220 --> 00:10:03.820]   make sure that you pick that up
[00:10:03.820 --> 00:10:06.260]   after each of the services, first, second, and third,
[00:10:06.260 --> 00:10:07.820]   and then there will be a photo booth.
[00:10:07.820 --> 00:10:11.340]   So if you're bringing a mom to attend the service,
[00:10:11.340 --> 00:10:12.180]   there will, obviously,
[00:10:12.180 --> 00:10:14.900]   there will be plenty of things and gifts
[00:10:14.900 --> 00:10:16.140]   that will be available,
[00:10:16.140 --> 00:10:18.340]   so make sure that you pick that up next Sunday.
[00:10:18.340 --> 00:10:21.340]   And then a quick announcement for the family ministry.
[00:10:21.340 --> 00:10:24.740]   If you are not part of the FAM245 and Jubilee,
[00:10:24.740 --> 00:10:27.140]   there is a family ministry picnic.
[00:10:27.140 --> 00:10:28.860]   I guess it could be open for everybody.
[00:10:28.860 --> 00:10:30.300]   It didn't make any limit.
[00:10:30.300 --> 00:10:32.020]   So if you're part of the family ministry,
[00:10:32.020 --> 00:10:34.940]   next Sunday from 11, is it next Sunday?
[00:10:34.940 --> 00:10:38.220]   Sorry, next Sunday, okay?
[00:10:38.220 --> 00:10:42.900]   On May 19, 11.30 to 3.30 at Bill Barber Memorial Park,
[00:10:42.900 --> 00:10:45.740]   they're gonna be having a casual fellowship.
[00:10:45.740 --> 00:10:48.420]   So you can go there and meet other family members
[00:10:48.420 --> 00:10:51.940]   and other couples and just kind of fellowship together.
[00:10:51.940 --> 00:10:54.500]   Then you bring your own lunch and then just show up.
[00:10:54.500 --> 00:10:56.460]   It'll be from 11.30 to 3.30.
[00:10:56.460 --> 00:10:59.580]   And then FAM245 ministry on Memorial Day,
[00:10:59.580 --> 00:11:03.380]   on May 25th, Saturday, from 11 to 2 p.m.,
[00:11:03.380 --> 00:11:06.620]   they are also going to be having barbecue fellowship.
[00:11:06.620 --> 00:11:08.100]   So if you're not sure what that ministry is,
[00:11:08.100 --> 00:11:10.460]   if you've been married for three years or less,
[00:11:10.460 --> 00:11:12.860]   that ministry is for you, okay?
[00:11:12.860 --> 00:11:15.340]   India pastor support.
[00:11:15.340 --> 00:11:17.740]   We have an annual commitment for that, $50 a month,
[00:11:17.740 --> 00:11:18.980]   that we'll be going to support
[00:11:18.980 --> 00:11:21.780]   our 40-plus pastors out in India.
[00:11:21.780 --> 00:11:23.340]   And so that is up in June,
[00:11:23.340 --> 00:11:26.220]   so we're asking that you would recommit to that.
[00:11:26.220 --> 00:11:28.940]   So either you wanna continue
[00:11:28.940 --> 00:11:30.660]   or you wanna be added to the list.
[00:11:30.660 --> 00:11:33.180]   And as you guys know of what's going on in India,
[00:11:33.180 --> 00:11:35.780]   they really need our support more than ever.
[00:11:35.780 --> 00:11:39.140]   And so if you can re-sign up for that, $50 a month,
[00:11:39.140 --> 00:11:41.380]   or if you wanna just give a one-time sum
[00:11:41.380 --> 00:11:43.940]   of $600 for the whole year,
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:47.500]   we'll make sure that those funds get out to India.
[00:11:47.500 --> 00:11:48.560]   Okay, a couple more things.
[00:11:48.560 --> 00:11:51.460]   One, a Korean golf tournament is happening on June 8th.
[00:11:51.460 --> 00:11:53.960]   I know we have a lot of fundraisers and tournaments,
[00:11:53.960 --> 00:11:57.820]   but this is for the people who don't like to get physical.
[00:11:57.820 --> 00:12:01.100]   So if you are transitioning to golf, okay,
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:06.200]   if that offended you, it's the truth.
[00:12:06.200 --> 00:12:08.860]   So June, so if you're transitioning to golf
[00:12:08.860 --> 00:12:10.780]   and you wanna play and help raise funds
[00:12:10.780 --> 00:12:12.220]   for our summer missions,
[00:12:12.220 --> 00:12:13.340]   that's happening on June 8th,
[00:12:13.340 --> 00:12:14.620]   so you can go sign up for that.
[00:12:14.620 --> 00:12:16.920]   And then one last announcement is,
[00:12:16.920 --> 00:12:20.060]   August 16th through 19th is our family retreat.
[00:12:20.060 --> 00:12:23.460]   Our guest speaker is Pastor John Street,
[00:12:23.460 --> 00:12:26.460]   who came a couple years ago to talk about reconciliation.
[00:12:26.460 --> 00:12:29.540]   And then the other topic that he is very well-known for,
[00:12:29.540 --> 00:12:30.940]   where he travels the country
[00:12:31.340 --> 00:12:34.260]   and sometimes internationally to speak on the subject,
[00:12:34.260 --> 00:12:37.580]   it's about God's design for marriage.
[00:12:37.580 --> 00:12:39.400]   So if you are part of the family ministry,
[00:12:39.400 --> 00:12:42.560]   whether you're FAM 245 all the way to Jubilee,
[00:12:42.560 --> 00:12:45.200]   if you're part of that ministry, please sign up for that.
[00:12:45.200 --> 00:12:48.880]   The early registration is going to be ending on June 2nd.
[00:12:48.880 --> 00:12:50.620]   So after that, it's gonna be late registration.
[00:12:50.620 --> 00:12:52.100]   So we're trying to ask as many people
[00:12:52.100 --> 00:12:54.420]   to sign up as early as possible
[00:12:54.420 --> 00:12:55.880]   so that they can get the rooms
[00:12:55.880 --> 00:12:58.200]   and various things prepared for that.
[00:12:58.200 --> 00:13:00.380]   So please mark that on your calendar.
[00:13:00.380 --> 00:13:03.860]   It's going to be on August 16th through August 19th,
[00:13:03.860 --> 00:13:07.580]   and that early registration will end on June 2nd, okay?
[00:13:07.580 --> 00:13:10.580]   All right, so after our praise time,
[00:13:10.580 --> 00:13:14.660]   our youth brother, Hezekiah Lee,
[00:13:14.660 --> 00:13:16.660]   is going to be giving his testimony.
[00:13:16.660 --> 00:13:19.080]   And so he's going to be breaking the record in our church
[00:13:19.080 --> 00:13:21.900]   as the youngest member who's going to be baptized today.
[00:13:21.900 --> 00:13:25.620]   And so watching him grow through these years,
[00:13:25.620 --> 00:13:28.260]   through literally infancy to where he is now.
[00:13:28.260 --> 00:13:31.540]   And so we've been praying and walking with this family,
[00:13:31.540 --> 00:13:34.100]   and I know how joyous they are and have guests to come.
[00:13:34.100 --> 00:13:36.540]   And again, every baptism is special,
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:39.300]   but when we have somebody who's been raised in the church
[00:13:39.300 --> 00:13:42.020]   since they were a child to be able to hear their testimony
[00:13:42.020 --> 00:13:44.340]   and to be baptized, become a member of the church,
[00:13:44.340 --> 00:13:47.980]   and obviously this is a prayer that we're having.
[00:13:47.980 --> 00:13:50.180]   One of the things that the older I get,
[00:13:50.180 --> 00:13:53.780]   it's hard not to think about the next generation, right?
[00:13:53.780 --> 00:13:55.620]   The older I get, so what is the next generation
[00:13:55.620 --> 00:13:57.780]   of Christians gonna look like in our church?
[00:13:57.780 --> 00:14:02.500]   And to see young people in our church coming to Christ
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:04.380]   and giving their life to Christ,
[00:14:04.380 --> 00:14:06.260]   it gives more and more assurance
[00:14:06.260 --> 00:14:08.820]   that the Lord has the church in his hands
[00:14:08.820 --> 00:14:12.100]   and that the next generation will be able to take the baton
[00:14:12.100 --> 00:14:14.420]   and everything that we are doing,
[00:14:14.420 --> 00:14:17.540]   that Lord willing, will not end with us.
[00:14:17.540 --> 00:14:20.500]   It will continue on with our children, okay?
[00:14:20.500 --> 00:14:24.720]   So after our offering, Hesi will come up
[00:14:24.720 --> 00:14:26.740]   and he'll give his testimony to be baptized this morning.
[00:14:26.740 --> 00:14:27.580]   Let's pray.
[00:14:27.580 --> 00:14:28.420]   - Amen.
[00:14:28.420 --> 00:14:34.740]   - Father, we thank you so much for your grace.
[00:14:34.740 --> 00:14:39.420]   Lord, there are times when we forget
[00:14:39.420 --> 00:14:41.580]   just how amazing this grace is,
[00:14:41.580 --> 00:14:45.900]   out of habit, out of comfort,
[00:14:45.900 --> 00:14:47.420]   out of just entanglement, Lord God,
[00:14:47.420 --> 00:14:49.180]   just living in this fallen world.
[00:14:49.180 --> 00:14:52.860]   I pray that you would help us this morning
[00:14:52.860 --> 00:14:55.420]   to lift our eyes to Christ,
[00:14:55.420 --> 00:14:58.340]   to know where our help, our comfort,
[00:14:58.340 --> 00:14:59.700]   our refuge comes from,
[00:14:59.700 --> 00:15:02.260]   that our worship that we give you
[00:15:02.260 --> 00:15:04.720]   may be an overflow of gratitude
[00:15:04.720 --> 00:15:07.180]   of the work that you are doing in us.
[00:15:07.180 --> 00:15:08.820]   I pray that even in this giving,
[00:15:08.820 --> 00:15:11.660]   may it be an expression of our worship
[00:15:11.660 --> 00:15:13.460]   and our love and adoration to you,
[00:15:13.460 --> 00:15:16.300]   and may it be multiplied 30, 60, 100 fold
[00:15:16.300 --> 00:15:18.380]   for the sake of your glory and your kingdom.
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:20.420]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:15:21.020 --> 00:15:24.100]   (gentle piano music)

[00:15:43.140 --> 00:16:07.260]   - Let us all rise, and before we continue with the praise,
[00:16:07.260 --> 00:16:08.260]   if we could spend a few moments
[00:16:08.260 --> 00:16:10.060]   to greet the neighbors around us.

[00:25:33.140 --> 00:26:00.020]   - Hi, my name is Hezekiah Lee.
[00:26:00.020 --> 00:26:02.580]   Although I go by my nickname, Hezzy.
[00:26:02.580 --> 00:26:03.940]   I'm 13 years old and I go to
[00:26:03.940 --> 00:26:05.900]   Los Alicos Intermediate School.
[00:26:05.900 --> 00:26:07.660]   Although I am young, through God's grace,
[00:26:07.660 --> 00:26:10.840]   I have accepted Jesus Christ as my Lord and Savior.
[00:26:10.840 --> 00:26:13.300]   I have been attending Berean since I was one year old,
[00:26:13.300 --> 00:26:14.980]   but before I met Christ,
[00:26:14.980 --> 00:26:17.900]   I only attended out of pure obedience to my parents.
[00:26:17.900 --> 00:26:20.700]   Growing up, I was very much a people pleaser.
[00:26:20.700 --> 00:26:23.300]   I was a rule follower and I tried to be a good kid.
[00:26:23.300 --> 00:26:26.280]   I strive for the approval of man and not God.
[00:26:26.280 --> 00:26:27.840]   As a firstborn of five siblings,
[00:26:27.840 --> 00:26:30.100]   there's a lot of responsibility and love required
[00:26:30.100 --> 00:26:31.300]   and I struggled with that.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:33.180]   I was constantly angry with my siblings
[00:26:33.180 --> 00:26:34.940]   and I held grudges against them.
[00:26:34.940 --> 00:26:37.280]   And the worst part was I was okay with that.
[00:26:37.280 --> 00:26:39.300]   I justified my sins, saying that it was their fault
[00:26:39.300 --> 00:26:41.320]   for instigating and making me angry.
[00:26:41.320 --> 00:26:42.860]   I chose not to acknowledge this sin
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:45.060]   and did the same with many other sins.
[00:26:45.060 --> 00:26:47.300]   I hated going to church and it was a burden
[00:26:47.300 --> 00:26:49.820]   and that I wanted to get over with every Sunday.
[00:26:49.820 --> 00:26:51.100]   And as I said, most of the times,
[00:26:51.100 --> 00:26:52.880]   I was considered the good kid,
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:55.740]   but when it came to church, I was very rebellious.
[00:26:55.740 --> 00:26:58.020]   Occasionally, I would insincerely ask my parents
[00:26:58.020 --> 00:26:59.180]   how I could become saved
[00:26:59.180 --> 00:27:01.780]   to make them think I cared about church.
[00:27:01.780 --> 00:27:05.060]   But through it all, God used my parents to draw me to him.
[00:27:05.060 --> 00:27:06.820]   I can remember moments when I was sitting in my bed
[00:27:06.820 --> 00:27:09.820]   with my mom and she would just share the gospel with me
[00:27:09.820 --> 00:27:11.900]   and she would get emotional and cry.
[00:27:11.900 --> 00:27:15.280]   And as God slowly but surely ruled me to him,
[00:27:15.280 --> 00:27:17.700]   I began to ask my parents genuine questions
[00:27:17.700 --> 00:27:20.220]   about God's grace.
[00:27:20.220 --> 00:27:21.980]   My dad would easily answer these questions
[00:27:21.980 --> 00:27:23.840]   from my immature mind with wisdom
[00:27:23.840 --> 00:27:26.660]   that always satisfied my questioning attitude.
[00:27:26.660 --> 00:27:28.220]   Also, my Sunday school teachers
[00:27:28.220 --> 00:27:30.420]   played a big role in my salvation.
[00:27:30.420 --> 00:27:32.820]   They were there to support me and show me the love of God
[00:27:32.820 --> 00:27:34.700]   through the care and compassion they showed me,
[00:27:34.700 --> 00:27:36.740]   even though they weren't my parents.
[00:27:36.740 --> 00:27:39.080]   Another person who had a big impact on my salvation
[00:27:39.080 --> 00:27:41.460]   was my late uncle, Uncle Leland.
[00:27:41.460 --> 00:27:43.700]   He was a man of God who served with all his heart
[00:27:43.700 --> 00:27:45.660]   and he was a prayer warrior.
[00:27:45.660 --> 00:27:47.900]   Since before I was born, he prayed for me every day
[00:27:47.900 --> 00:27:50.340]   and he taught me the effect of prayer and its impact
[00:27:50.340 --> 00:27:52.420]   when it is aligned with God's will.
[00:27:52.420 --> 00:27:54.120]   All of these people, and countless more,
[00:27:54.120 --> 00:27:56.340]   played a huge role in my salvation.
[00:27:56.340 --> 00:27:58.400]   What really shook me was the day the Holy Spirit
[00:27:58.400 --> 00:28:00.760]   entered my heart and revealed to me my sin
[00:28:00.760 --> 00:28:02.680]   and where it was taking me.
[00:28:02.680 --> 00:28:04.960]   I realized the depth and the gravity of hell
[00:28:04.960 --> 00:28:06.800]   and it scared me when I realized
[00:28:06.800 --> 00:28:08.480]   that's where I was going.
[00:28:08.480 --> 00:28:10.320]   But what the Holy Spirit also revealed to me
[00:28:10.320 --> 00:28:12.760]   was there was a Savior who reconciled my sin
[00:28:12.760 --> 00:28:15.840]   and erased my punishment, Jesus Christ.
[00:28:15.840 --> 00:28:17.840]   After that, Christ affirmed my salvation
[00:28:17.840 --> 00:28:19.600]   and I was freed from my punishment.
[00:28:19.600 --> 00:28:22.120]   And more importantly, I was freed to seek a relationship
[00:28:22.120 --> 00:28:23.380]   with God through Christ.
[00:28:23.380 --> 00:28:26.420]   Once Jesus changed my heart of stone,
[00:28:26.420 --> 00:28:27.660]   my whole life changed.
[00:28:27.660 --> 00:28:30.480]   I was more aware of my sin and I started hating it.
[00:28:30.480 --> 00:28:32.580]   Instead of just panicking in times of distress,
[00:28:32.580 --> 00:28:36.340]   I prayed and sought his comfort, forgiveness, or both.
[00:28:36.340 --> 00:28:38.580]   There's a verse that assured me during troubling times.
[00:28:38.580 --> 00:28:41.560]   It is from John 10, 27 to 30.
[00:28:41.560 --> 00:28:43.840]   My sheep hear my voice and I know them
[00:28:43.840 --> 00:28:46.580]   and they follow me and I give eternal life to them.
[00:28:46.580 --> 00:28:48.740]   They will never perish and no one will snatch them
[00:28:48.740 --> 00:28:49.700]   out of my hand.
[00:28:49.700 --> 00:28:52.840]   My Father, who has given them to me, is greater than all
[00:28:52.840 --> 00:28:55.440]   and no one is able to snatch them out of the Father's hand.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:56.700]   I and the Father are one.
[00:28:56.700 --> 00:28:59.960]   It reminded me how since God has saved me
[00:28:59.960 --> 00:29:02.200]   and put me in his hand, the full force of the world
[00:29:02.200 --> 00:29:03.960]   and the devil could never change that.
[00:29:03.960 --> 00:29:06.840]   And it reminds me that even though I struggle and fail,
[00:29:06.840 --> 00:29:09.400]   nothing will shake God's love for me.
[00:29:09.400 --> 00:29:12.080]   Even though I am saved, I still struggle in many ways.
[00:29:12.080 --> 00:29:13.800]   One of them is when kids are bothering me,
[00:29:13.800 --> 00:29:16.560]   I still have a painful and sinful impulse
[00:29:16.560 --> 00:29:17.680]   to lash out in anger.
[00:29:18.560 --> 00:29:20.580]   Another is that sometimes I get caught in the flow
[00:29:20.580 --> 00:29:22.300]   of homework and how cumbersome it is
[00:29:22.300 --> 00:29:25.100]   and I forego prayer for sleep.
[00:29:25.100 --> 00:29:27.060]   I'm so thankful that I now have a church family
[00:29:27.060 --> 00:29:29.180]   to support me and keep me accountable.
[00:29:29.180 --> 00:29:30.640]   Thank you.
[00:29:30.640 --> 00:29:33.800]   (audience applauding)
[00:29:33.800 --> 00:29:48.300]   - Aziz, you need to become the president
[00:29:48.300 --> 00:29:49.460]   of the United States.
[00:29:49.460 --> 00:29:52.460]   (audience laughing)
[00:29:52.460 --> 00:29:56.340]   You understand when you go into the water
[00:29:56.340 --> 00:29:58.220]   that you are being united to Christ's death.
[00:29:58.220 --> 00:29:59.420]   When you come out, you're being united
[00:29:59.420 --> 00:30:01.900]   to Jesus's resurrected life.
[00:30:01.900 --> 00:30:05.260]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:30:05.260 --> 00:30:07.600]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:30:07.600 --> 00:30:13.720]   (audience applauding)
[00:30:13.720 --> 00:30:16.720]   (audience cheering)
[00:30:16.720 --> 00:30:31.480]   Congratulations to the whole family.
[00:30:31.480 --> 00:30:32.880]   Yeah, we're so proud of you.
[00:30:32.880 --> 00:30:34.680]   All right.
[00:30:34.680 --> 00:30:39.400]   We need to have the Lee family give a seminar
[00:30:39.400 --> 00:30:40.600]   on how to raise children.
[00:30:40.600 --> 00:30:43.680]   (audience laughing)
[00:30:43.680 --> 00:30:44.880]   If you can turn your Bibles with me
[00:30:44.880 --> 00:30:46.600]   to Luke chapter eight,
[00:30:46.600 --> 00:30:48.680]   and I'm gonna be just reading verse 14.
[00:30:48.680 --> 00:30:55.160]   Luke chapter eight, verse 14.
[00:30:55.160 --> 00:31:04.720]   The seed which fell among the thorns,
[00:31:04.720 --> 00:31:07.280]   these are the ones who have heard,
[00:31:07.280 --> 00:31:08.800]   and as they go on their way,
[00:31:08.800 --> 00:31:11.160]   they are choked with worries and riches
[00:31:11.160 --> 00:31:15.120]   and pleasures of this life and bring no fruit to maturity.
[00:31:15.120 --> 00:31:15.960]   Let's pray.
[00:31:15.960 --> 00:31:20.200]   Father, we pray for wisdom.
[00:31:20.200 --> 00:31:23.840]   We pray for open ears, softened hearts,
[00:31:23.840 --> 00:31:28.460]   and willingness, Lord God, to not just listen, but to obey.
[00:31:28.460 --> 00:31:30.400]   May your word reveal to us the thoughts
[00:31:30.400 --> 00:31:33.440]   and intentions of our heart and our very lives
[00:31:33.440 --> 00:31:37.240]   that we truly may live a life worthy of the gospel.
[00:31:37.240 --> 00:31:38.080]   We thank you, Father.
[00:31:38.080 --> 00:31:39.720]   In Jesus's name we pray, amen.
[00:31:40.720 --> 00:31:45.720]   - As you guys know, the latest buzz in technology is AI,
[00:31:45.720 --> 00:31:51.160]   and so it's getting so good that now they're using it
[00:31:51.160 --> 00:31:52.480]   and they can alter videos,
[00:31:52.480 --> 00:31:55.240]   and all you need to do is put up a picture,
[00:31:55.240 --> 00:31:58.000]   and it'll look like it's somebody that we know,
[00:31:58.000 --> 00:32:02.440]   a celebrity, that actually looks like they're talking,
[00:32:02.440 --> 00:32:04.600]   but if you listen carefully,
[00:32:04.600 --> 00:32:07.200]   kind of like, hmm, that's weird that they're saying this,
[00:32:07.200 --> 00:32:09.640]   and realizing that it's gotten so good
[00:32:09.640 --> 00:32:10.920]   that now they have to filter,
[00:32:10.920 --> 00:32:13.960]   and you really have to watch what you're listening
[00:32:13.960 --> 00:32:16.000]   and what you're reading.
[00:32:16.000 --> 00:32:17.200]   It's scary how good it is,
[00:32:17.200 --> 00:32:19.160]   and I'm sure some of you guys have encountered that,
[00:32:19.160 --> 00:32:21.560]   and somebody's trying to push an agenda
[00:32:21.560 --> 00:32:25.080]   or trying to push certain thoughts
[00:32:25.080 --> 00:32:27.120]   and people to kind of give in to that,
[00:32:27.120 --> 00:32:29.080]   so they would get a popular celebrity
[00:32:29.080 --> 00:32:32.280]   or somebody who's an athlete that is beloved
[00:32:32.280 --> 00:32:34.560]   and using them to push their agenda.
[00:32:34.560 --> 00:32:38.240]   So all the more why we need to be vigilant to test,
[00:32:38.240 --> 00:32:41.000]   is it true or is it not true?
[00:32:41.000 --> 00:32:42.940]   But as that danger is coming in,
[00:32:42.940 --> 00:32:45.680]   and more and more people are warning
[00:32:45.680 --> 00:32:49.880]   and telling us that we need to be aware of this,
[00:32:49.880 --> 00:32:51.880]   this has always been the case.
[00:32:51.880 --> 00:32:56.400]   Jesus himself warned us that our enemy
[00:32:56.400 --> 00:33:00.220]   is going to come an angel of light,
[00:33:00.220 --> 00:33:02.400]   and he's gonna say he's speaking for God
[00:33:02.400 --> 00:33:05.540]   in order to deliberately delude the church.
[00:33:06.920 --> 00:33:10.340]   In fact, our enemy is called the father of lies.
[00:33:10.340 --> 00:33:14.660]   So this deception didn't start with AI.
[00:33:14.660 --> 00:33:17.000]   The articles that you read,
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:18.680]   the things that are popular in our culture,
[00:33:18.680 --> 00:33:19.960]   the thoughts that you have,
[00:33:19.960 --> 00:33:23.520]   even sometimes the theology that you embrace,
[00:33:23.520 --> 00:33:24.760]   where did that come from?
[00:33:24.760 --> 00:33:28.560]   Is that, did that come from a careful understanding
[00:33:28.560 --> 00:33:29.680]   of the word of God?
[00:33:29.680 --> 00:33:33.600]   Discerning if it truly was God speaking
[00:33:33.600 --> 00:33:36.320]   or was that the general feeling of the culture?
[00:33:36.320 --> 00:33:38.200]   Was that a trend that came in?
[00:33:38.200 --> 00:33:41.520]   Or maybe a charismatic pastor said some things
[00:33:41.520 --> 00:33:44.040]   and you read their books and then you were convinced
[00:33:44.040 --> 00:33:45.040]   that it makes more sense?
[00:33:45.040 --> 00:33:48.600]   Or maybe your meter of right and wrong
[00:33:48.600 --> 00:33:52.160]   is based upon how you feel, what you think balances.
[00:33:52.160 --> 00:33:55.400]   I remember years ago, I was trying to share the gospel
[00:33:55.400 --> 00:33:57.800]   with a Buddhist monk.
[00:33:57.800 --> 00:34:00.640]   I came out of the, the doctor appointment came
[00:34:00.640 --> 00:34:02.680]   and I saw a handful of Buddhist monks coming in
[00:34:02.680 --> 00:34:04.400]   and I said, well, I've never witnessed a monk before,
[00:34:04.400 --> 00:34:05.560]   so let me try.
[00:34:05.560 --> 00:34:08.080]   And so I started speaking to this young man
[00:34:08.080 --> 00:34:12.120]   and we're talking and he knew very little about his faith.
[00:34:12.120 --> 00:34:12.960]   He was already a monk.
[00:34:12.960 --> 00:34:15.000]   He was a young guy, I could tell he was being,
[00:34:15.000 --> 00:34:18.080]   he was like being interned, right?
[00:34:18.080 --> 00:34:20.120]   And so he was talking about heaven and hell
[00:34:20.120 --> 00:34:21.560]   and I was trying to share the gospel with him
[00:34:21.560 --> 00:34:23.960]   and he was telling me how, you know,
[00:34:23.960 --> 00:34:26.640]   he believes possibly there's a heaven and hell
[00:34:26.640 --> 00:34:29.600]   and I said, your Buddhist faith doesn't sound anything
[00:34:29.600 --> 00:34:31.320]   like anything I learned.
[00:34:31.320 --> 00:34:35.920]   So I asked him, so what caused you to want to be a monk?
[00:34:35.920 --> 00:34:38.280]   And he said there was this monk who had a huge impact
[00:34:38.280 --> 00:34:40.400]   on his life when he was young
[00:34:40.400 --> 00:34:43.240]   and he wanted to please him and he wanted to be like him.
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:46.360]   So without much thought, he just went in
[00:34:46.360 --> 00:34:49.240]   and so I caught him early
[00:34:49.240 --> 00:34:52.800]   and eventually as he was sharing with me,
[00:34:52.800 --> 00:34:55.000]   one of the older monks basically just grabbed him
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.540]   and pulled him away because you could tell,
[00:34:56.540 --> 00:34:59.240]   like he had no idea what he was talking about, right?
[00:35:00.600 --> 00:35:03.880]   How many of us are afraid to evangelize
[00:35:03.880 --> 00:35:05.880]   because your faith has not been tested?
[00:35:05.880 --> 00:35:11.960]   How many of you are afraid to encounter hostile,
[00:35:11.960 --> 00:35:13.240]   people who are hostile to the faith
[00:35:13.240 --> 00:35:16.880]   because you're afraid once they begin to poke at your faith
[00:35:16.880 --> 00:35:18.760]   that at the end of it, you might come out saying,
[00:35:18.760 --> 00:35:20.780]   huh, I didn't really think this through.
[00:35:20.780 --> 00:35:23.960]   I'm not exactly sure why I believe what I believe.
[00:35:23.960 --> 00:35:25.240]   And in fear of that,
[00:35:25.240 --> 00:35:27.580]   you stay away from any kind of conflict.
[00:35:30.280 --> 00:35:33.400]   In 2 Corinthians 13, five,
[00:35:33.400 --> 00:35:36.960]   Paul tells the Corinthian church,
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:39.600]   test yourselves to see if you are in the faith.
[00:35:39.600 --> 00:35:43.320]   Examine yourselves or do you not recognize this
[00:35:43.320 --> 00:35:45.440]   about yourself that Jesus Christ is in you
[00:35:45.440 --> 00:35:48.460]   unless indeed you fail the test?
[00:35:48.460 --> 00:35:52.840]   He actually tells him and he's writing this to the church
[00:35:52.840 --> 00:35:54.160]   and the reason why he's writing this
[00:35:54.160 --> 00:35:57.540]   is because they were acting like non-Christians.
[00:35:57.540 --> 00:35:59.640]   They were divided, chaos in the church
[00:35:59.640 --> 00:36:00.940]   and they were one-upping each other,
[00:36:00.940 --> 00:36:02.800]   they were comparing each other
[00:36:02.800 --> 00:36:05.320]   so even their communion table,
[00:36:05.320 --> 00:36:07.880]   they had the rich and the poor separated
[00:36:07.880 --> 00:36:09.640]   and it was causing all kinds of chaos
[00:36:09.640 --> 00:36:12.800]   and so he was not asking them
[00:36:12.800 --> 00:36:15.480]   or telling them to examine yourself
[00:36:15.480 --> 00:36:17.840]   because he wanted to put doubt of their faith.
[00:36:17.840 --> 00:36:19.200]   He's writing to the church saying,
[00:36:19.200 --> 00:36:21.200]   hey, examine yourself carefully.
[00:36:21.200 --> 00:36:24.480]   See if your life is consistent with what you profess.
[00:36:24.480 --> 00:36:26.820]   Not simply that you're at church,
[00:36:26.820 --> 00:36:28.860]   not simply because you grew up in the church,
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:32.120]   but are the things you confess consistent
[00:36:32.120 --> 00:36:34.440]   to the way you're living your life,
[00:36:34.440 --> 00:36:35.720]   the way you're making decisions,
[00:36:35.720 --> 00:36:37.520]   the way you're raising your children,
[00:36:37.520 --> 00:36:39.880]   is it consistent with your faith?
[00:36:39.880 --> 00:36:43.820]   And the hope that Paul has in asking to do that
[00:36:43.820 --> 00:36:46.500]   is so that genuine Christians
[00:36:46.500 --> 00:36:49.480]   would take a long, hard look at themselves
[00:36:49.480 --> 00:36:53.260]   and to correct anything that needs to be corrected.
[00:36:53.260 --> 00:36:58.540]   That if you just accepted a cultural Christianity
[00:36:58.540 --> 00:37:02.960]   in your life and you feel confident
[00:37:02.960 --> 00:37:05.860]   just because everybody else looks like you,
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:07.680]   to take a step back and ask yourself,
[00:37:07.680 --> 00:37:12.680]   test yourself, are you really a follower of Christ?
[00:37:12.680 --> 00:37:16.080]   Years ago, some of you guys who are a little bit older
[00:37:16.080 --> 00:37:19.480]   may remember back in the 1970s,
[00:37:19.480 --> 00:37:20.640]   there was Jesus movement
[00:37:20.640 --> 00:37:22.340]   and Chuck Smith was at the center of that,
[00:37:22.340 --> 00:37:24.320]   Calvary Chapel was blowing up
[00:37:24.320 --> 00:37:25.720]   and during that period,
[00:37:25.720 --> 00:37:27.880]   it almost became popular to be a Christian
[00:37:27.880 --> 00:37:31.980]   so many celebrities came out and professed their faith
[00:37:31.980 --> 00:37:33.900]   and it seems like there's something like that
[00:37:33.900 --> 00:37:35.380]   going on right now.
[00:37:35.380 --> 00:37:36.780]   More and more celebrities are coming out
[00:37:36.780 --> 00:37:40.100]   and saying, "I believe in God, I'm doing this and that,"
[00:37:40.100 --> 00:37:42.860]   and that was true back in the '70s.
[00:37:42.860 --> 00:37:44.460]   So I can name all these people,
[00:37:44.460 --> 00:37:47.540]   but I'm assuming most of you won't even know who they are.
[00:37:47.540 --> 00:37:50.500]   One of the top names of that time was Bob Dylan.
[00:37:50.500 --> 00:37:53.100]   Some of you guys may know him, right?
[00:37:53.100 --> 00:37:55.960]   Bob Dylan was probably one of the top songwriters
[00:37:55.960 --> 00:37:59.060]   of the 1970s and he came out and became a Christian
[00:37:59.060 --> 00:38:01.660]   and he wrote two albums, two whole albums,
[00:38:01.660 --> 00:38:05.700]   one called Saved, another one called Slow Train Coming.
[00:38:05.700 --> 00:38:07.700]   And again, I'm only naming Bob Dylan,
[00:38:07.700 --> 00:38:11.100]   but at that time, if you go and look up 1970s,
[00:38:11.100 --> 00:38:13.960]   Jesus movement, celebrities who came to Christ,
[00:38:13.960 --> 00:38:16.560]   you will see a whole gamut of people.
[00:38:16.560 --> 00:38:19.460]   Well, Bob Dylan was probably the most popular
[00:38:19.460 --> 00:38:21.180]   and most famous of the ones
[00:38:21.180 --> 00:38:24.440]   and soon after, after he wrote this,
[00:38:24.440 --> 00:38:26.700]   he fell away from his faith.
[00:38:26.700 --> 00:38:28.700]   And so people were curious, what happened to you?
[00:38:28.700 --> 00:38:31.200]   And Bob Dylan simply said, "It was just a phase."
[00:38:31.200 --> 00:38:32.900]   And he just moved on,
[00:38:32.900 --> 00:38:35.140]   just like many of the other celebrities who just moved on.
[00:38:35.140 --> 00:38:37.700]   It was just, at that time, it was popular
[00:38:37.700 --> 00:38:39.460]   and they just got caught up in the moment.
[00:38:39.460 --> 00:38:42.620]   The modern day version of that is Kanye West.
[00:38:42.620 --> 00:38:44.660]   Okay, so you guys know who Kanye West is.
[00:38:44.660 --> 00:38:46.700]   If you remember, not that long ago,
[00:38:46.700 --> 00:38:48.300]   he professed that he became a Christian
[00:38:48.300 --> 00:38:50.380]   and he was writing gospel songs
[00:38:50.380 --> 00:38:53.160]   and he was having Sunday services with choirs
[00:38:53.160 --> 00:38:57.340]   and buying towns up so that he can bring revival.
[00:38:57.340 --> 00:38:59.460]   Well, the latest comment that he made about his faith,
[00:38:59.460 --> 00:39:02.540]   and he said, "You know, I have my issues with Jesus.
[00:39:02.540 --> 00:39:04.820]   "There's a lot of stuff I went through that I prayed
[00:39:04.820 --> 00:39:07.140]   "and I ain't see Jesus show up."
[00:39:07.140 --> 00:39:09.940]   And so the conclusion of that is basically,
[00:39:09.940 --> 00:39:11.300]   Jesus disappointed me.
[00:39:11.300 --> 00:39:13.660]   When I needed him, he didn't show up.
[00:39:13.660 --> 00:39:15.140]   And so the follow up to that is,
[00:39:15.140 --> 00:39:17.620]   therefore, I decided to believe myself.
[00:39:17.620 --> 00:39:21.780]   I don't think any of us
[00:39:21.780 --> 00:39:24.080]   who are examining the scriptures carefully
[00:39:24.080 --> 00:39:26.360]   are that surprised, right?
[00:39:26.360 --> 00:39:28.840]   Because even as he was professing his faith,
[00:39:28.840 --> 00:39:30.840]   and like many of the other celebrities,
[00:39:30.840 --> 00:39:34.040]   their life didn't actually coincide
[00:39:34.040 --> 00:39:35.000]   with what they were doing.
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:36.240]   Nothing changed in their lyrics,
[00:39:36.240 --> 00:39:37.440]   nothing changed in their lifestyle,
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:39.460]   nothing changed about fornication.
[00:39:39.460 --> 00:39:42.280]   It was just, now I have Jesus as my comfort.
[00:39:42.280 --> 00:39:46.720]   But I'm not worried about the celebrities.
[00:39:46.720 --> 00:39:49.800]   I'm not worried about what's happening out in our culture.
[00:39:49.800 --> 00:39:52.460]   The primary concern is the church.
[00:39:52.460 --> 00:39:57.460]   In fact, most of scripture is to the church.
[00:39:57.460 --> 00:39:58.700]   It's to the church.
[00:39:58.700 --> 00:40:02.080]   The concern is, we know that the world is in rebellion.
[00:40:02.080 --> 00:40:05.220]   We know that the world is going to hate God
[00:40:05.220 --> 00:40:06.540]   and they're blaspheming his name.
[00:40:06.540 --> 00:40:07.540]   Nothing of that has changed.
[00:40:07.540 --> 00:40:09.420]   Nothing of that should surprise us.
[00:40:09.420 --> 00:40:12.060]   But the church, the primary attack
[00:40:12.060 --> 00:40:14.980]   that Satan has is toward the church
[00:40:14.980 --> 00:40:17.700]   because the world is already his.
[00:40:17.700 --> 00:40:22.040]   So when they rebel, when they do what they do,
[00:40:22.040 --> 00:40:22.880]   it's not a surprise.
[00:40:22.880 --> 00:40:25.840]   And he's not concerned about them because they're his.
[00:40:25.840 --> 00:40:29.320]   But it's the church that he attacks.
[00:40:29.320 --> 00:40:31.780]   He dilutes, he deceives.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:37.740]   And that's exactly why Jesus is telling this parable,
[00:40:37.740 --> 00:40:39.680]   because his popularity is growing,
[00:40:39.680 --> 00:40:42.280]   the numbers are growing from hundreds to thousands.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:45.560]   And so in that midst, he's warning his disciples
[00:40:45.560 --> 00:40:48.220]   just because a large number of people are coming
[00:40:48.220 --> 00:40:50.680]   doesn't mean that that's true fruit.
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:53.920]   So he's warning his disciples,
[00:40:53.920 --> 00:40:56.280]   there's gonna come a time when majority of these people
[00:40:56.280 --> 00:40:58.760]   are gonna reject me, turn away, don't be surprised by that.
[00:40:58.760 --> 00:41:00.760]   Because they never followed me
[00:41:00.760 --> 00:41:02.920]   because they really believed to begin with.
[00:41:02.920 --> 00:41:04.760]   They saw the miracles.
[00:41:04.760 --> 00:41:07.960]   They're gonna eat the miraculous bread and the fish.
[00:41:07.960 --> 00:41:09.880]   They're gonna see his power.
[00:41:09.880 --> 00:41:13.160]   And they, there's a celebrity in town.
[00:41:13.160 --> 00:41:16.360]   So out of curiosity, they were coming to see him.
[00:41:16.360 --> 00:41:19.400]   And he was warning the crowds that were coming.
[00:41:19.400 --> 00:41:23.060]   Many of you are coming to me and you're professing
[00:41:23.060 --> 00:41:25.520]   that maybe you believe that I'm the Messiah.
[00:41:25.520 --> 00:41:27.580]   But the real reason why you're coming
[00:41:27.580 --> 00:41:29.260]   is because you want the benefits
[00:41:29.260 --> 00:41:30.940]   that you think you're gonna get.
[00:41:30.940 --> 00:41:33.040]   By forcing me to be your king,
[00:41:33.040 --> 00:41:35.440]   that I can serve you and heal you
[00:41:35.440 --> 00:41:37.920]   and feed you and protect you.
[00:41:37.920 --> 00:41:42.000]   And so you see me as an avenue for a better life on earth.
[00:41:42.000 --> 00:41:44.240]   And as a result of that, you will also fall away.
[00:41:44.240 --> 00:41:46.320]   That's not true fruit.
[00:41:46.320 --> 00:41:50.240]   So the whole reason why this parable is given to us
[00:41:50.240 --> 00:41:52.680]   is to purify the church.
[00:41:52.680 --> 00:41:56.760]   To make sure that the fruit that we have is true fruit.
[00:41:56.760 --> 00:41:59.280]   That the followers are true followers.
[00:41:59.280 --> 00:42:02.080]   The four souls that we look at,
[00:42:02.080 --> 00:42:03.580]   the first one is the easiest to tell
[00:42:03.580 --> 00:42:06.680]   because they hear, they don't understand, they reject.
[00:42:06.680 --> 00:42:08.000]   So they don't have a problem.
[00:42:08.000 --> 00:42:10.080]   They'll tell you, I don't believe.
[00:42:11.200 --> 00:42:14.080]   Majority of them will usually just walk away.
[00:42:14.080 --> 00:42:15.240]   This is nonsense.
[00:42:15.240 --> 00:42:17.840]   And they don't have a problem telling you,
[00:42:17.840 --> 00:42:19.720]   I'm not a believer, I'm not a follower of Christ.
[00:42:19.720 --> 00:42:22.340]   So they're easy to identify.
[00:42:22.340 --> 00:42:24.080]   The problem with the post-Christian culture
[00:42:24.080 --> 00:42:27.440]   that even that group is in the church.
[00:42:27.440 --> 00:42:29.600]   And the church is bending over backwards
[00:42:29.600 --> 00:42:31.400]   so that they won't leave the church.
[00:42:31.400 --> 00:42:34.600]   But first group is easy to identify.
[00:42:34.600 --> 00:42:36.200]   Second group is a little bit harder
[00:42:36.200 --> 00:42:38.000]   because they fall on rocky soil.
[00:42:38.000 --> 00:42:41.320]   And initially, they receive it with joy.
[00:42:41.320 --> 00:42:44.040]   So this looks like immediate fruit.
[00:42:44.040 --> 00:42:46.560]   So they may raise their hand, come down the aisle,
[00:42:46.560 --> 00:42:49.680]   maybe even be baptized when active for a short period,
[00:42:49.680 --> 00:42:52.200]   but it says that because their roots are not connected.
[00:42:52.200 --> 00:42:54.120]   There's no root.
[00:42:54.120 --> 00:42:55.400]   There's no real faith.
[00:42:55.400 --> 00:42:58.960]   There's no real connection to the living water.
[00:42:58.960 --> 00:43:02.440]   So when the sun comes, it withers and it dies.
[00:43:02.440 --> 00:43:06.020]   They're a little bit more difficult to identify
[00:43:06.020 --> 00:43:07.600]   because you look at it and say,
[00:43:07.600 --> 00:43:09.320]   well, one saved always saved, right?
[00:43:09.320 --> 00:43:11.400]   We're saved by grace, right?
[00:43:11.400 --> 00:43:12.660]   And so there's a lot of confusion
[00:43:12.660 --> 00:43:15.520]   because of the way that the gospel was preached,
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.600]   that if they made a decision, you're saved for life.
[00:43:19.600 --> 00:43:21.640]   Although the scripture says over and over again,
[00:43:21.640 --> 00:43:23.560]   you will know them by their fruit.
[00:43:23.560 --> 00:43:26.920]   The simple word confession is not saving faith.
[00:43:26.920 --> 00:43:29.080]   Even the demons profess that.
[00:43:29.080 --> 00:43:30.300]   And they shudder in fear
[00:43:30.300 --> 00:43:33.100]   because they know that judgment is coming for them.
[00:43:33.100 --> 00:43:36.040]   And yet, because of the gospel was preached
[00:43:36.040 --> 00:43:41.040]   to allow conviction, allow salvation,
[00:43:41.040 --> 00:43:44.040]   to as many people as, so if you just say the words,
[00:43:44.040 --> 00:43:46.680]   if I can just lead you in sinner's prayer,
[00:43:46.680 --> 00:43:48.760]   if I can just get you to get into this water,
[00:43:48.760 --> 00:43:51.760]   if I can just get you to become a member of the church,
[00:43:51.760 --> 00:43:54.480]   and now you're saved for eternity.
[00:43:54.480 --> 00:43:56.400]   And as a result of that, the church is filled
[00:43:56.400 --> 00:43:58.820]   with people who are part of the second soil,
[00:43:58.820 --> 00:44:01.840]   and some of them have left,
[00:44:01.840 --> 00:44:03.960]   and some of them have never left.
[00:44:03.960 --> 00:44:05.680]   But they're a little bit more difficult to tell,
[00:44:05.680 --> 00:44:10.120]   but they're also easier because it's obvious.
[00:44:10.120 --> 00:44:11.240]   It's more obvious.
[00:44:11.240 --> 00:44:13.660]   But the third soil is a difficult one.
[00:44:13.660 --> 00:44:17.680]   It says that they were planted, and if you see it,
[00:44:17.680 --> 00:44:22.680]   that the thorns probably was not there in the beginning.
[00:44:22.680 --> 00:44:28.760]   No old farmer's gonna go and put seed and ground
[00:44:28.760 --> 00:44:30.480]   where there's thorns and there's weeds,
[00:44:30.480 --> 00:44:32.800]   and usually they're gonna have to clear the ground
[00:44:32.800 --> 00:44:33.620]   and think it's safe.
[00:44:33.620 --> 00:44:36.160]   So it says that as the plant started to grow,
[00:44:36.160 --> 00:44:38.520]   the weeds grew with it.
[00:44:38.520 --> 00:44:41.500]   So it's hard to tell.
[00:44:41.500 --> 00:44:44.620]   And then when it tells us that when it grew,
[00:44:44.620 --> 00:44:46.120]   it began to choke.
[00:44:46.120 --> 00:44:50.420]   The second soil, it hurt it, and initially it grew,
[00:44:50.420 --> 00:44:52.540]   but there's no root, so it didn't take long to die.
[00:44:52.540 --> 00:44:56.420]   So it lasted a little bit longer than the first one,
[00:44:56.420 --> 00:44:57.460]   but eventually it dies.
[00:44:57.460 --> 00:45:01.400]   The third one, the third one is the difficult part.
[00:45:03.160 --> 00:45:05.900]   What Christian doesn't have struggles?
[00:45:05.900 --> 00:45:08.540]   What Christian isn't tempted?
[00:45:08.540 --> 00:45:11.300]   What Christian doesn't have worries?
[00:45:11.300 --> 00:45:16.140]   And so this is the group that is hard to discern,
[00:45:16.140 --> 00:45:18.940]   and that's where Jesus says to be careful
[00:45:18.940 --> 00:45:21.040]   when you separate the wheat and the tares.
[00:45:21.040 --> 00:45:24.660]   If we are too quickly judging somebody,
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:26.780]   saying, "Oh, they're not doing this,"
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:27.620]   or, "They're not active,"
[00:45:27.620 --> 00:45:30.860]   or, "They said this," or, "They're doing that,"
[00:45:30.860 --> 00:45:32.760]   tell me a Christian who doesn't struggle
[00:45:32.760 --> 00:45:34.560]   with some of these things.
[00:45:34.560 --> 00:45:39.240]   But clearly, he says, that third soil is not a Christian,
[00:45:39.240 --> 00:45:40.580]   because they get choked.
[00:45:40.580 --> 00:45:43.680]   And as a result of being choked,
[00:45:43.680 --> 00:45:44.960]   they said there's no nutrients,
[00:45:44.960 --> 00:45:47.800]   and eventually it dies, there's no fruit.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:48.960]   And because they have no fruit,
[00:45:48.960 --> 00:45:52.400]   Jesus is saying even those people are not genuine Christians.
[00:45:52.400 --> 00:45:55.600]   The only true Christian is the one who perseveres
[00:45:55.600 --> 00:45:58.020]   and bears fruit 30, 60, 100-fold,
[00:45:58.020 --> 00:45:59.560]   which we'll get to next week.
[00:46:00.500 --> 00:46:03.540]   This morning, I want to take some time looking at this,
[00:46:03.540 --> 00:46:07.580]   and ultimately, you have to ask yourself.
[00:46:07.580 --> 00:46:12.180]   I knew some Christians who were caught in sin,
[00:46:12.180 --> 00:46:15.940]   in difficulty, and from a distance,
[00:46:15.940 --> 00:46:16.780]   you can look at them and say,
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:18.060]   "Man, how can that be a Christian?"
[00:46:18.060 --> 00:46:21.060]   And then I would have lunch with them and talk to them
[00:46:21.060 --> 00:46:23.060]   and have more sympathy toward them.
[00:46:23.060 --> 00:46:25.580]   It's like, this is a struggling Christian.
[00:46:25.580 --> 00:46:26.660]   And so we're going to come alongside,
[00:46:26.660 --> 00:46:28.300]   encourage them, keep them accountable,
[00:46:28.300 --> 00:46:29.460]   maybe even rebuke them,
[00:46:29.460 --> 00:46:31.580]   but they respond and repent and they return.
[00:46:31.580 --> 00:46:33.380]   And then I've met some people who,
[00:46:33.380 --> 00:46:35.160]   "How can that person not be a Christian?
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:36.500]   "Look at what they've done.
[00:46:36.500 --> 00:46:37.940]   "Look at their respect.
[00:46:37.940 --> 00:46:38.940]   "Look at what they're doing."
[00:46:38.940 --> 00:46:41.860]   And then you spend more and more time with them.
[00:46:41.860 --> 00:46:43.760]   It's like, "Huh, is that a Christian?"
[00:46:43.760 --> 00:46:47.060]   So it's hard to discern.
[00:46:47.060 --> 00:46:48.760]   So I'm asking you,
[00:46:48.760 --> 00:46:52.700]   because the difference between a Christian and non-Christian
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.180]   is how you respond to the word of God.
[00:46:55.180 --> 00:46:58.380]   So after this sermon, you're going to hear it,
[00:46:58.380 --> 00:47:00.980]   and maybe if you do not have faith,
[00:47:00.980 --> 00:47:03.920]   you're going to either be irritated by what I say,
[00:47:03.920 --> 00:47:05.580]   "Oh, that guy's questioning me."
[00:47:05.580 --> 00:47:07.180]   Again?
[00:47:07.180 --> 00:47:10.260]   Or you're just going to shut your ear.
[00:47:10.260 --> 00:47:13.500]   Easiest thing to do is pretend like you never heard it.
[00:47:13.500 --> 00:47:15.220]   And you're just going to walk away and just live your life.
[00:47:15.220 --> 00:47:17.620]   It's like, "Ah, he's going crazy again."
[00:47:17.620 --> 00:47:18.860]   Because it's not relevant to you,
[00:47:18.860 --> 00:47:21.060]   because you don't believe.
[00:47:21.060 --> 00:47:23.300]   It's not that relevant what the word of God says
[00:47:23.300 --> 00:47:24.940]   and what it reveals.
[00:47:24.940 --> 00:47:26.500]   Because you don't believe it.
[00:47:26.500 --> 00:47:29.360]   You just need to have other people think you believe it,
[00:47:29.360 --> 00:47:31.220]   but because you don't really believe it,
[00:47:31.220 --> 00:47:34.220]   whatever I say from this pulpit is really not relevant.
[00:47:34.220 --> 00:47:37.180]   But if you are a believer in Christ, examine it.
[00:47:37.180 --> 00:47:38.860]   If there's anything that makes you feel uncomfortable,
[00:47:38.860 --> 00:47:39.760]   examine it.
[00:47:39.760 --> 00:47:42.000]   Look at it.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:43.860]   See what it says.
[00:47:43.860 --> 00:47:45.580]   So I'm asking you, right?
[00:47:45.580 --> 00:47:47.700]   At the end of the sermon, I'm not going to just,
[00:47:47.700 --> 00:47:48.820]   "Okay, you, you, you.
[00:47:48.820 --> 00:47:50.940]   "You're a Christian, you're a Christian, okay."
[00:47:50.940 --> 00:47:52.140]   But I'm asking you,
[00:47:52.140 --> 00:47:55.540]   how will the word of God affect you?
[00:47:55.540 --> 00:47:57.100]   How will you examine yourself?
[00:47:57.100 --> 00:47:59.180]   How will you have assurance of salvation?
[00:47:59.180 --> 00:48:04.100]   What are the thorns, right?
[00:48:04.100 --> 00:48:05.420]   What are the thorns that grew up,
[00:48:05.420 --> 00:48:09.500]   that choked and caused the plant to die, right?
[00:48:09.500 --> 00:48:12.580]   First of all, it says, "Worries of the world."
[00:48:12.580 --> 00:48:14.580]   And that's how it's expressed in Matthew and Mark,
[00:48:14.580 --> 00:48:17.560]   and then in the Gospel of Luke, it just says, "Worries."
[00:48:17.560 --> 00:48:22.420]   Every stage of life, there's concerns, there's worries.
[00:48:22.420 --> 00:48:24.940]   When you get, every time you move on to the next stage,
[00:48:24.940 --> 00:48:27.660]   you kind of look at the concern that you had
[00:48:27.660 --> 00:48:31.060]   in the previous stage, and it's like, "Ah, so trivial."
[00:48:31.060 --> 00:48:33.260]   So if you're in college, you look at junior high school,
[00:48:33.260 --> 00:48:35.180]   high school students, "Oh, my life was so good."
[00:48:35.180 --> 00:48:37.700]   And all they have to worry about is getting into college.
[00:48:37.700 --> 00:48:39.460]   You wait until you get to college.
[00:48:39.460 --> 00:48:41.220]   The worries of life.
[00:48:41.220 --> 00:48:44.620]   And those of you who recently graduated,
[00:48:44.620 --> 00:48:45.860]   you know, you see the college students
[00:48:45.860 --> 00:48:47.060]   struggling with college life.
[00:48:47.060 --> 00:48:49.060]   "Ha, ha, ha, college life.
[00:48:49.060 --> 00:48:53.540]   "I wish, I wish I was back in college
[00:48:53.540 --> 00:48:55.460]   "when everything was presented to us
[00:48:55.460 --> 00:48:57.340]   "and had friends with us all the time."
[00:48:57.340 --> 00:48:59.180]   And all you have to worry about is your grade.
[00:48:59.180 --> 00:49:00.380]   "Ha, ha, ha, ha."
[00:49:00.380 --> 00:49:02.380]   You wait 'til you get a job.
[00:49:02.380 --> 00:49:06.740]   Have to wake up every single morning, how tiring it is.
[00:49:06.740 --> 00:49:08.100]   And then you move on, you get married,
[00:49:08.100 --> 00:49:09.840]   it's like, "Oh, my gosh, I thought,
[00:49:09.840 --> 00:49:12.080]   "I thought, just working, now I gotta work,
[00:49:12.080 --> 00:49:16.100]   "and I have to make sure that my wife is happy."
[00:49:16.100 --> 00:49:19.840]   And then those who have children,
[00:49:19.840 --> 00:49:21.620]   that's when the real judgment starts to happen.
[00:49:21.620 --> 00:49:25.460]   It's like, "Your life is hard?
[00:49:25.460 --> 00:49:26.740]   "I got kids at home.
[00:49:26.740 --> 00:49:28.180]   "There is no free time.
[00:49:28.180 --> 00:49:29.260]   "What do you do with your free time?"
[00:49:29.260 --> 00:49:30.600]   "Free time."
[00:49:30.600 --> 00:49:35.580]   You go home and you're so tired, right?
[00:49:35.580 --> 00:49:38.700]   And it's like, "Yeah, you guys don't have kids.
[00:49:38.700 --> 00:49:40.340]   "Your life is so easy."
[00:49:40.340 --> 00:49:42.420]   And then the next stage, it's like,
[00:49:42.420 --> 00:49:46.460]   "You wait 'til you have teenagers in your house."
[00:49:46.460 --> 00:49:49.660]   You know, it's like, "I wish my kids were little.
[00:49:49.660 --> 00:49:52.900]   "I dream about the day when our kids were little."
[00:49:52.900 --> 00:49:57.860]   And then they get a little bit older, you know,
[00:49:57.860 --> 00:50:01.060]   and then it's like, "Man, then we talking about money."
[00:50:01.060 --> 00:50:03.580]   And it's like, "Oh, it's so expensive having money."
[00:50:03.580 --> 00:50:05.020]   You wait 'til they start driving
[00:50:05.020 --> 00:50:07.620]   and start going to school, right?
[00:50:07.620 --> 00:50:11.920]   Just the car insurance alone, right?
[00:50:11.920 --> 00:50:13.140]   Man, your life is easy.
[00:50:13.140 --> 00:50:15.020]   It was easy when they're attached to you.
[00:50:15.020 --> 00:50:17.980]   And then once they start leaving the house,
[00:50:17.980 --> 00:50:21.980]   that's when the real psychological battle happens, right?
[00:50:21.980 --> 00:50:23.260]   Every stage of life.
[00:50:23.260 --> 00:50:25.020]   And then as you get older, right?
[00:50:25.020 --> 00:50:26.980]   I'm starting to get into that stage
[00:50:26.980 --> 00:50:30.980]   where I look at all of that as so easy, right?
[00:50:30.980 --> 00:50:34.060]   My biggest problem is I just don't have energy.
[00:50:34.060 --> 00:50:38.060]   And if I could just sleep better, if I had better health,
[00:50:38.060 --> 00:50:39.300]   I should have done this better,
[00:50:39.300 --> 00:50:40.360]   I should have done that better.
[00:50:40.360 --> 00:50:41.580]   It's so much harder now.
[00:50:41.580 --> 00:50:43.660]   It was so easy before.
[00:50:43.660 --> 00:50:45.500]   Every stage of life.
[00:50:45.500 --> 00:50:48.580]   And I'm sure in my 60s and 70s,
[00:50:48.580 --> 00:50:50.600]   there's gonna be other things that are gonna come up,
[00:50:50.600 --> 00:50:52.020]   but every stage of life,
[00:50:52.020 --> 00:50:56.540]   there is something that we're going to use
[00:50:56.540 --> 00:50:59.980]   and say, "Only if I get to the next stage.
[00:50:59.980 --> 00:51:02.500]   "Only if I was in the previous stage.
[00:51:02.500 --> 00:51:04.440]   "Right now, I just don't have time.
[00:51:04.440 --> 00:51:06.800]   "I'm too busy."
[00:51:06.800 --> 00:51:10.260]   And as a result of this worry,
[00:51:10.260 --> 00:51:12.980]   it begins to choke the word of God.
[00:51:13.980 --> 00:51:15.580]   You never reject the word of God.
[00:51:15.580 --> 00:51:17.500]   The word of God is never fully received
[00:51:17.500 --> 00:51:19.380]   because you always delay it.
[00:51:19.380 --> 00:51:21.620]   You never say, "I'm not gonna obey God.
[00:51:21.620 --> 00:51:24.840]   "I'm going to wait until my circumstance changes.
[00:51:24.840 --> 00:51:27.340]   "Until my children are raised.
[00:51:27.340 --> 00:51:28.260]   "Until I get married.
[00:51:28.260 --> 00:51:29.520]   "Until I have enough money.
[00:51:29.520 --> 00:51:30.760]   "Until I have a stable job.
[00:51:30.760 --> 00:51:32.700]   "Until I'm in better health."
[00:51:32.700 --> 00:51:35.020]   And so we never reject God.
[00:51:35.020 --> 00:51:37.100]   We just delay obedience.
[00:51:37.100 --> 00:51:41.540]   And as a result of that, when the word of God is preached,
[00:51:41.540 --> 00:51:43.340]   the word gets choked in your life.
[00:51:44.340 --> 00:51:45.860]   Because of the worries and concerns.
[00:51:45.860 --> 00:51:50.420]   And the worries and concerns are not always ungodly things.
[00:51:50.420 --> 00:51:53.980]   Sometimes it's in the context of doing God's work.
[00:51:53.980 --> 00:51:55.540]   Like Martha.
[00:51:55.540 --> 00:51:56.820]   We're so worried, running around,
[00:51:56.820 --> 00:51:58.380]   trying to take care of everything,
[00:51:58.380 --> 00:52:00.500]   that their personal walk with God,
[00:52:00.500 --> 00:52:03.860]   their connection, their abiding in Christ, suffers.
[00:52:03.860 --> 00:52:06.440]   Because they're so worried about so many things.
[00:52:06.440 --> 00:52:10.520]   Let me tell you something that may disturb you.
[00:52:11.580 --> 00:52:13.500]   If you haven't been disturbed already.
[00:52:13.500 --> 00:52:19.620]   Choosing right and wrong is not that complicated.
[00:52:19.620 --> 00:52:22.080]   One of the things that we struggle with
[00:52:22.080 --> 00:52:24.940]   more than anything else is what is and isn't God's will.
[00:52:24.940 --> 00:52:30.420]   But what makes choosing right and wrong so difficult
[00:52:30.420 --> 00:52:34.060]   is not because right and wrong is so difficult.
[00:52:34.060 --> 00:52:37.800]   Because God sees it light and darkness, good and evil.
[00:52:37.800 --> 00:52:40.620]   Righteousness and unrighteousness.
[00:52:40.620 --> 00:52:41.540]   It's very black and white.
[00:52:41.540 --> 00:52:43.860]   But the reason why it doesn't seem black and white with us
[00:52:43.860 --> 00:52:46.460]   is not because God hasn't made it clear.
[00:52:46.460 --> 00:52:50.060]   It's because in the context of decision making,
[00:52:50.060 --> 00:52:52.260]   what gets tangled up in our decision is,
[00:52:52.260 --> 00:52:54.020]   how will that affect me?
[00:52:54.020 --> 00:52:58.220]   If I choose this, how will it affect me?
[00:52:58.220 --> 00:52:59.440]   How will it affect my future?
[00:52:59.440 --> 00:53:01.100]   How will it affect my finances?
[00:53:01.100 --> 00:53:02.540]   How will it affect my housing?
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.140]   How will it affect my plans?
[00:53:04.140 --> 00:53:06.060]   And so everything that God teaches
[00:53:06.060 --> 00:53:10.620]   comes through a filter of my plans, my concerns.
[00:53:10.620 --> 00:53:15.200]   So even though right and wrong, God and Satan,
[00:53:15.200 --> 00:53:18.080]   is very clear, the reason why it gets muddled up
[00:53:18.080 --> 00:53:20.480]   is because we haven't fully surrendered.
[00:53:20.480 --> 00:53:23.800]   Because we are not dead.
[00:53:23.800 --> 00:53:26.760]   If we're dead in Christ, what is God's
[00:53:26.760 --> 00:53:29.180]   and what is not God's is very simple.
[00:53:29.180 --> 00:53:31.380]   I'm not saying it's easy, but it's simple.
[00:53:31.380 --> 00:53:35.340]   When you're a child and you have nothing to worry about,
[00:53:35.340 --> 00:53:36.700]   and you're not worried about the future,
[00:53:36.700 --> 00:53:38.080]   you're not worried about your bank account,
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:39.820]   you're not worried about what other people are gonna think,
[00:53:39.820 --> 00:53:41.780]   you're not worried about how the decision
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:43.940]   that you're gonna make, how it's gonna affect you,
[00:53:43.940 --> 00:53:44.980]   how it's gonna affect your family,
[00:53:44.980 --> 00:53:46.420]   you're not worried about any of that.
[00:53:46.420 --> 00:53:49.720]   All you're worried about is, what did God say?
[00:53:49.720 --> 00:53:53.180]   What did he say?
[00:53:53.180 --> 00:53:54.880]   So when you're a child, you're not worried about,
[00:53:54.880 --> 00:53:56.580]   if I do this, what if I can't go to school,
[00:53:56.580 --> 00:53:58.940]   what if I, if God, if my dad told me to do it,
[00:53:58.940 --> 00:54:00.700]   I just do it, and it's simple.
[00:54:00.700 --> 00:54:03.460]   May not be easy, but it's simple.
[00:54:03.460 --> 00:54:06.300]   But reason why it's difficult is because we add to that,
[00:54:06.300 --> 00:54:08.580]   well, if I do this, then what about this?
[00:54:08.580 --> 00:54:12.100]   If I do that, then I might get fired.
[00:54:12.100 --> 00:54:14.260]   If I do that, then I might lose my friend.
[00:54:14.260 --> 00:54:17.080]   If I do that, then I might not get married.
[00:54:17.080 --> 00:54:19.300]   If I do that, then I'm gonna have to do this.
[00:54:19.300 --> 00:54:24.300]   And so we intermingle my concerns and my worries
[00:54:24.300 --> 00:54:31.540]   with what it is exactly that God is saying.
[00:54:31.540 --> 00:54:32.500]   Well, God said it clear.
[00:54:32.500 --> 00:54:33.340]   Who's gonna go from it?
[00:54:33.340 --> 00:54:35.060]   Here am I, send me.
[00:54:35.060 --> 00:54:36.140]   Well, where am I gonna go?
[00:54:36.140 --> 00:54:36.980]   Go over here.
[00:54:36.980 --> 00:54:39.220]   Well, they're not, well, I'm gonna go there,
[00:54:39.220 --> 00:54:40.060]   and they're not gonna listen?
[00:54:40.060 --> 00:54:41.580]   He said, yeah, that's what I would.
[00:54:41.580 --> 00:54:42.820]   What if I go, and they don't listen?
[00:54:42.820 --> 00:54:45.440]   He said, don't worry about it, I told you.
[00:54:45.440 --> 00:54:46.900]   What if I can't speak?
[00:54:46.900 --> 00:54:49.620]   Don't worry about it, I made your mouth, go.
[00:54:49.620 --> 00:54:56.280]   So much of our confusion is because we're not dead yet.
[00:54:59.300 --> 00:55:02.620]   And we are trying so hard to align God's will
[00:55:02.620 --> 00:55:07.340]   with my will, and so we're only obedient
[00:55:07.340 --> 00:55:09.900]   when his will aligns with our will.
[00:55:09.900 --> 00:55:15.580]   But if we don't have a will, if we're dead in Christ,
[00:55:15.580 --> 00:55:18.680]   all we're concerned about is what did he say?
[00:55:18.680 --> 00:55:21.640]   What does he want?
[00:55:21.640 --> 00:55:24.980]   What brings the greatest glory to him?
[00:55:24.980 --> 00:55:27.540]   What's going to spread the gospel to the greatest degree?
[00:55:27.540 --> 00:55:28.900]   What's going to bear the most fruit?
[00:55:28.900 --> 00:55:30.380]   That's all you're concerned about,
[00:55:30.380 --> 00:55:32.880]   and the consequences are in his hands.
[00:55:32.880 --> 00:55:36.940]   See, when an individual who's wrestling
[00:55:36.940 --> 00:55:40.020]   with all the decisions entangled with my will,
[00:55:40.020 --> 00:55:42.300]   my concern, my worries, the word of God
[00:55:42.300 --> 00:55:45.620]   begins to get choked, because when the word of God goes out,
[00:55:45.620 --> 00:55:46.980]   we don't hear it directly.
[00:55:46.980 --> 00:55:50.380]   We hear it with a filter of my will.
[00:55:50.380 --> 00:55:53.620]   And then the word of God gets choked.
[00:55:55.680 --> 00:55:59.080]   Secondly, it says the deceitfulness of wealth,
[00:55:59.080 --> 00:56:02.180]   or riches, just plainly like Luke says.
[00:56:02.180 --> 00:56:08.100]   Again, some of the most godliest people
[00:56:08.100 --> 00:56:11.640]   that I've met in my life were very, very wealthy.
[00:56:11.640 --> 00:56:14.120]   In fact, there's countless number of people
[00:56:14.120 --> 00:56:16.400]   in the Bible who are very wealthy.
[00:56:16.400 --> 00:56:20.100]   Millionaires, in our standard, could be billionaires,
[00:56:20.100 --> 00:56:21.640]   and they were very godly.
[00:56:21.640 --> 00:56:23.160]   The issue is not with money.
[00:56:24.020 --> 00:56:26.400]   Just like anything else, if you have health,
[00:56:26.400 --> 00:56:28.180]   God can use that.
[00:56:28.180 --> 00:56:30.300]   We live in a free country, God can use that.
[00:56:30.300 --> 00:56:32.180]   Anything that we have, we offer up to God,
[00:56:32.180 --> 00:56:33.020]   God can use that.
[00:56:33.020 --> 00:56:35.300]   I know plenty of people who are very wealthy
[00:56:35.300 --> 00:56:37.940]   who uses their money for the kingdom of God.
[00:56:37.940 --> 00:56:40.260]   He said it's the deceitfulness of wealth.
[00:56:40.260 --> 00:56:43.140]   It is the love of money.
[00:56:43.140 --> 00:56:46.360]   What you think having money is going to accomplish.
[00:56:46.360 --> 00:56:49.500]   But if you step back and look carefully
[00:56:49.500 --> 00:56:53.800]   of why we believe that we need to have more money,
[00:56:53.800 --> 00:56:56.780]   money will satisfy your coveting.
[00:56:56.780 --> 00:56:59.940]   There's things that you've allowed and said,
[00:56:59.940 --> 00:57:03.220]   I want that, and B, if I had money, I would have that.
[00:57:03.220 --> 00:57:08.220]   And we have created our wants, and we've made it our needs.
[00:57:08.220 --> 00:57:12.240]   But so much of what we think that we need
[00:57:12.240 --> 00:57:15.780]   is simply us coveting, coveting.
[00:57:17.140 --> 00:57:19.500]   What they have, what they drive.
[00:57:19.500 --> 00:57:21.540]   Like, oh, I wanna do this, I wanna do that,
[00:57:21.540 --> 00:57:22.660]   I wanna take care of my family.
[00:57:22.660 --> 00:57:25.320]   And so, it's not a need, it's a want.
[00:57:25.320 --> 00:57:30.660]   So we are deceived, thinking money
[00:57:30.660 --> 00:57:33.020]   is going to satisfy my coveting.
[00:57:33.020 --> 00:57:36.780]   Money will satisfy your pride, your status.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:39.180]   You go somewhere and everybody else is driving a nice car
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:41.260]   and you're not, and so I need it.
[00:57:41.260 --> 00:57:46.780]   And so what it feeds is your pride.
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:49.120]   I don't want my kids to be the only one at school
[00:57:49.120 --> 00:57:49.960]   who doesn't have this.
[00:57:49.960 --> 00:57:51.900]   I don't want my kids not to experience this.
[00:57:51.900 --> 00:57:55.340]   And so we're feeding so that our children
[00:57:55.340 --> 00:57:58.080]   have these things that other kids have.
[00:57:58.080 --> 00:57:59.940]   And so we made that a need,
[00:57:59.940 --> 00:58:03.620]   to build up status for my children.
[00:58:03.620 --> 00:58:07.940]   And sometimes the worst decisions that we make against God
[00:58:07.940 --> 00:58:10.340]   are in the excuse with our children.
[00:58:10.340 --> 00:58:14.420]   Because for me, it's selfish.
[00:58:14.420 --> 00:58:16.860]   I don't have love of money, I don't care what I drive,
[00:58:16.860 --> 00:58:19.980]   I don't care what I wear, but my children.
[00:58:19.980 --> 00:58:22.820]   So I won't covet for me, but I will covet for my children,
[00:58:22.820 --> 00:58:24.860]   and somehow we think that that's godly.
[00:58:24.860 --> 00:58:27.940]   That's how you're deceived.
[00:58:27.940 --> 00:58:29.580]   That's how we get deceived.
[00:58:29.580 --> 00:58:31.580]   It satisfies our flesh.
[00:58:31.580 --> 00:58:35.020]   If I don't have money, my friends are traveling,
[00:58:35.020 --> 00:58:36.280]   they're doing this, they're buying that,
[00:58:36.280 --> 00:58:37.500]   but I can't do that.
[00:58:37.500 --> 00:58:41.860]   So in order for me to live a certain lifestyle,
[00:58:41.860 --> 00:58:43.660]   I need to have this.
[00:58:43.660 --> 00:58:48.660]   Now, nothing ungodly about having that,
[00:58:48.660 --> 00:58:52.780]   but when we are deceived to think I need that,
[00:58:52.780 --> 00:58:55.940]   that becomes our priority.
[00:58:55.940 --> 00:58:58.100]   An anonymous writer said this,
[00:58:58.100 --> 00:58:58.940]   and I want to read this to you
[00:58:58.940 --> 00:59:01.700]   because I think it captures the right attitude,
[00:59:01.700 --> 00:59:02.520]   right perspective.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:04.720]   Money can buy a house, but not a home.
[00:59:04.720 --> 00:59:08.340]   A bed, but not a rest.
[00:59:08.340 --> 00:59:09.860]   Food, but not an appetite.
[00:59:09.860 --> 00:59:11.060]   Medicine, but not health.
[00:59:11.060 --> 00:59:12.540]   Information, but not wisdom.
[00:59:12.540 --> 00:59:13.700]   Thrills, but not joy.
[00:59:13.700 --> 00:59:15.500]   Associates, but not friends.
[00:59:15.500 --> 00:59:17.300]   Servants, but not loyalty.
[00:59:17.300 --> 00:59:19.740]   Flattery, but not respect.
[00:59:19.740 --> 00:59:22.180]   The things that we desire,
[00:59:22.180 --> 00:59:25.020]   things that may give us value and happiness in our lives,
[00:59:25.020 --> 00:59:26.260]   money cannot buy.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.380]   But because we convince ourselves
[00:59:29.380 --> 00:59:31.740]   that these are things that we need, not want,
[00:59:31.740 --> 00:59:34.380]   we make that a priority.
[00:59:34.380 --> 00:59:37.060]   Once I have this, and that's why Jesus says,
[00:59:37.060 --> 00:59:38.340]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[00:59:38.340 --> 00:59:41.300]   "and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:59:41.300 --> 00:59:42.420]   But if we're not careful, we say,
[00:59:42.420 --> 00:59:44.520]   "We want to seek these things first."
[00:59:44.520 --> 00:59:48.140]   And hopefully God will honor this later.
[00:59:48.140 --> 00:59:52.100]   First Timothy 6, nine through 12, it says,
[00:59:52.100 --> 00:59:56.540]   "But those who want to get rich fall into temptation."
[00:59:56.540 --> 00:59:57.380]   Now, some of you guys may read that.
[00:59:57.380 --> 00:59:58.420]   It's like, "I don't want to get rich.
[00:59:58.420 --> 01:00:01.820]   "I just want to have enough, enough."
[01:00:01.820 --> 01:00:04.340]   And so, what is the standard of enough?
[01:00:04.340 --> 01:00:09.080]   How much of what you have called enough, coveting?
[01:00:10.260 --> 01:00:14.900]   How much of what you and I have called enough, status?
[01:00:14.900 --> 01:00:18.100]   How much of what you and I have been convinced
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:22.060]   of enough is feeding our flesh?
[01:00:22.060 --> 01:00:24.940]   There's not a single person in this room
[01:00:24.940 --> 01:00:28.500]   who didn't have shoes to wear.
[01:00:28.500 --> 01:00:31.420]   How many of you starved last night?
[01:00:31.420 --> 01:00:35.720]   Not because you're on a 18-hour fast
[01:00:35.720 --> 01:00:38.820]   so you can get rid of your chin, right?
[01:00:38.820 --> 01:00:39.900]   I'm saying 'cause you just didn't have food.
[01:00:39.900 --> 01:00:41.460]   There's not a single person in here.
[01:00:41.460 --> 01:00:44.940]   We're rich, every single one of us.
[01:00:44.940 --> 01:00:51.180]   They said that if you are an average pay person
[01:00:51.180 --> 01:00:55.300]   in the United States, making somewhere between 50, 60,000,
[01:00:55.300 --> 01:00:57.300]   which I know most of you make more than that
[01:00:57.300 --> 01:00:59.600]   'cause we live in California, right?
[01:00:59.600 --> 01:01:04.880]   You're top 1% of the world, the world, right?
[01:01:04.880 --> 01:01:08.100]   But we convince ourselves that we're not.
[01:01:09.460 --> 01:01:13.260]   And so we think and pursue wealth like a poor person.
[01:01:13.260 --> 01:01:16.820]   And so the worries and concerns
[01:01:16.820 --> 01:01:18.140]   and the deceitfulness of riches,
[01:01:18.140 --> 01:01:20.660]   so when you have money, you're afraid
[01:01:20.660 --> 01:01:22.820]   that the decisions you make following Christ,
[01:01:22.820 --> 01:01:25.820]   picking up your cross, is gonna cause you to lose money.
[01:01:25.820 --> 01:01:28.820]   And then if you don't have money,
[01:01:28.820 --> 01:01:30.780]   if you pick up your cross and follow Christ
[01:01:30.780 --> 01:01:32.660]   and obey everything that God tells us,
[01:01:32.660 --> 01:01:34.460]   that I'm not gonna have money.
[01:01:34.460 --> 01:01:38.060]   So whether you have money, whether you don't have money,
[01:01:38.060 --> 01:01:42.940]   the deceitfulness of riches causes you to say not now.
[01:01:42.940 --> 01:01:45.200]   Not now.
[01:01:45.200 --> 01:01:48.860]   This is not a rebuke to the rich.
[01:01:48.860 --> 01:01:51.460]   This is not a rebuke simply to the poor
[01:01:51.460 --> 01:01:54.100]   'cause we can all easily be deceived.
[01:01:54.100 --> 01:01:57.860]   Our concern this morning is,
[01:01:57.860 --> 01:02:01.900]   is your shoes gonna match the sock that you wore?
[01:02:01.900 --> 01:02:03.300]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:03.500 --> 01:02:07.420]   My biggest struggle is what am I gonna eat today?
[01:02:07.420 --> 01:02:12.380]   I ate sushi the other day, so I don't want sushi again.
[01:02:12.380 --> 01:02:13.260]   You know what I mean?
[01:02:13.260 --> 01:02:16.580]   I don't want a heartburn, so I can't eat that.
[01:02:16.580 --> 01:02:18.780]   You know, I'm gonna have Korean later tonight,
[01:02:18.780 --> 01:02:21.620]   so I can't have Korean, that's my biggest struggle.
[01:02:21.620 --> 01:02:22.460]   Right?
[01:02:22.460 --> 01:02:26.100]   And probably most of you.
[01:02:26.100 --> 01:02:33.100]   But somehow we convince ourselves that we need it.
[01:02:34.100 --> 01:02:39.100]   What we need is Christ.
[01:02:39.100 --> 01:02:44.260]   But we made the only thing that we actually need
[01:02:44.260 --> 01:02:45.460]   into a want.
[01:02:45.460 --> 01:02:50.260]   So we want Christ, but we're not desperate for him.
[01:02:50.260 --> 01:02:52.940]   We're not yearning for him.
[01:02:52.940 --> 01:02:55.060]   We're not committed to him.
[01:02:55.060 --> 01:02:57.060]   We're not actively pursuing him.
[01:02:57.060 --> 01:03:00.580]   So we want Christ, but even if that doesn't happen,
[01:03:00.580 --> 01:03:01.820]   there's no serious consequence.
[01:03:01.820 --> 01:03:04.780]   But when we're not actively pursuing finances,
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:05.620]   something's wrong.
[01:03:05.620 --> 01:03:07.300]   We feel a sense of urgency.
[01:03:07.300 --> 01:03:08.300]   The bills are not paid.
[01:03:08.300 --> 01:03:09.140]   We cannot eat.
[01:03:09.140 --> 01:03:10.700]   My kids are not taken care of.
[01:03:10.700 --> 01:03:12.420]   And we pray and we cling to God
[01:03:12.420 --> 01:03:15.340]   because our wants are not being met.
[01:03:15.340 --> 01:03:18.020]   But the only need that we have is Christ.
[01:03:18.020 --> 01:03:22.540]   Is when our value is flipped upside down,
[01:03:22.540 --> 01:03:25.300]   the word of God begins to get choked in our lives.
[01:03:25.300 --> 01:03:27.220]   And so when the word of God is exposed,
[01:03:27.220 --> 01:03:28.980]   I can preach to you about the grace of God,
[01:03:28.980 --> 01:03:31.140]   the love of God, the security of Christ,
[01:03:31.140 --> 01:03:33.580]   and how your salvation you can never lose.
[01:03:33.580 --> 01:03:35.780]   And I can preach to that every single Sunday
[01:03:35.780 --> 01:03:39.660]   until the day you die, and you will thank me for it,
[01:03:39.660 --> 01:03:41.580]   and bear absolutely no fruit.
[01:03:41.580 --> 01:03:47.900]   You're in a slow-moving boat to condemnation
[01:03:47.900 --> 01:03:51.020]   in the church, singing songs,
[01:03:51.020 --> 01:03:53.140]   actively maybe even serving,
[01:03:53.140 --> 01:03:59.060]   but the word of God has been choked in your life for years.
[01:04:00.460 --> 01:04:02.100]   Because when you hear the imperatives,
[01:04:02.100 --> 01:04:04.260]   when you hear the commands,
[01:04:04.260 --> 01:04:08.100]   and it doesn't align with your fears and your worries,
[01:04:08.100 --> 01:04:09.540]   it can't be from God.
[01:04:09.540 --> 01:04:15.140]   When your concerns and your desire for wealth
[01:04:15.140 --> 01:04:17.580]   and the word of God is exposed,
[01:04:17.580 --> 01:04:18.460]   and it doesn't fit,
[01:04:18.460 --> 01:04:20.180]   and it makes you feel uncomfortable,
[01:04:20.180 --> 01:04:23.260]   automatically it's good for them.
[01:04:23.260 --> 01:04:25.820]   But God didn't call all of us.
[01:04:25.820 --> 01:04:28.060]   God didn't challenge all of us.
[01:04:28.060 --> 01:04:30.820]   And so we harden our hearts deliberately
[01:04:30.820 --> 01:04:34.300]   so that that word doesn't have any effect.
[01:04:34.300 --> 01:04:36.260]   And the easiest way to do that is,
[01:04:36.260 --> 01:04:39.380]   Pastor Peter is on his hobby horse again.
[01:04:39.380 --> 01:04:42.980]   I knew this church was gonna be like this.
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:46.980]   Or just shut your ears.
[01:04:46.980 --> 01:04:51.020]   You go out, maybe you're disturbed,
[01:04:51.020 --> 01:04:52.340]   or maybe you heard, you didn't hear it,
[01:04:52.340 --> 01:04:55.580]   but you go out and nothing ever changes.
[01:04:56.620 --> 01:05:00.480]   You just committed to the horse that you rode in on.
[01:05:00.480 --> 01:05:01.900]   That's the horse that you're gonna ride
[01:05:01.900 --> 01:05:02.900]   'til the day you die.
[01:05:02.900 --> 01:05:06.660]   And the next time you're gonna hear
[01:05:06.660 --> 01:05:10.620]   the unadulterated truth that's gonna change you
[01:05:10.620 --> 01:05:13.980]   is when you meet the living Lord.
[01:05:13.980 --> 01:05:18.140]   And he says, "Not everybody who calls me Lord, Lord,
[01:05:18.140 --> 01:05:20.220]   "shall enter the kingdom of heaven."
[01:05:20.220 --> 01:05:23.980]   And you've been hearing that all your life,
[01:05:23.980 --> 01:05:26.780]   but you deliberately choked the word of God in your life.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:31.380]   So he warns us, "Anyone who wants to get rich
[01:05:31.380 --> 01:05:32.820]   "falls into a temptation and a stare,
[01:05:32.820 --> 01:05:34.240]   "and many foolish and harmful desires
[01:05:34.240 --> 01:05:36.840]   "would plunge men into ruin and destruction.
[01:05:36.840 --> 01:05:39.700]   "The love of money is a root of all sorts of evil."
[01:05:39.700 --> 01:05:41.260]   Some of you guys may listen to that and say,
[01:05:41.260 --> 01:05:42.460]   "I don't love money.
[01:05:42.460 --> 01:05:46.780]   "I don't get $100 bills and throw it on the bed
[01:05:46.780 --> 01:05:49.420]   "and jump on it and take Instagram pictures.
[01:05:49.420 --> 01:05:50.600]   "So I don't love money.
[01:05:50.600 --> 01:05:52.420]   "I don't even like the color green."
[01:05:52.940 --> 01:05:54.020]   Right?
[01:05:54.020 --> 01:05:56.540]   Obviously, the love of money is not expressed
[01:05:56.540 --> 01:05:58.760]   in paper bills.
[01:05:58.760 --> 01:06:03.580]   Love of money is expressed through love of comfort,
[01:06:03.580 --> 01:06:06.580]   love of ease, love of pleasure,
[01:06:06.580 --> 01:06:11.040]   love of security, love of things.
[01:06:11.040 --> 01:06:15.940]   Love of money is not so, "Oh, I don't care if I have a."
[01:06:15.940 --> 01:06:20.100]   All those loves are an expression of love of money.
[01:06:21.600 --> 01:06:23.260]   And it deceives us.
[01:06:23.260 --> 01:06:25.660]   He says, "Flee from these things, you men of God,
[01:06:25.660 --> 01:06:26.700]   "and pursue righteousness."
[01:06:26.700 --> 01:06:28.700]   Godliness, faith, love, perseverance, and gentleness.
[01:06:28.700 --> 01:06:30.060]   Fight the good fight.
[01:06:30.060 --> 01:06:32.900]   Fight the good fight.
[01:06:32.900 --> 01:06:37.380]   Before we commit ourselves to fight the good fight
[01:06:37.380 --> 01:06:38.840]   to the outside world,
[01:06:38.840 --> 01:06:43.260]   that we wanna be the light to the darkness,
[01:06:43.260 --> 01:06:45.560]   we have to fight the good fight that is in us.
[01:06:45.560 --> 01:06:49.300]   We have to fight the temptation in us.
[01:06:49.300 --> 01:06:51.560]   We have to fight the things
[01:06:51.560 --> 01:06:54.280]   that choke the word of God in us.
[01:06:54.280 --> 01:06:59.120]   Before we can be effective in being the light to the world,
[01:06:59.120 --> 01:07:00.660]   we have to first be the light.
[01:07:00.660 --> 01:07:05.040]   You can't turn on the light when you go outside
[01:07:05.040 --> 01:07:08.280]   if your light is dim when you're inside.
[01:07:08.280 --> 01:07:11.500]   So he says, "Fight the good fight."
[01:07:11.500 --> 01:07:13.240]   First and foremost, the fight is in you.
[01:07:13.240 --> 01:07:14.640]   Fight is here.
[01:07:14.640 --> 01:07:17.740]   It needs to happen here.
[01:07:17.740 --> 01:07:19.440]   The things that we can't see,
[01:07:19.440 --> 01:07:21.000]   the word of God needs to judge the thoughts
[01:07:21.000 --> 01:07:22.920]   and intentions of your heart
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:24.280]   so that what is right and wrong,
[01:07:24.280 --> 01:07:25.880]   what is from God, what is from the devil,
[01:07:25.880 --> 01:07:27.640]   is not so complicated.
[01:07:27.640 --> 01:07:31.360]   We spend so much time being worried about the gray area.
[01:07:31.360 --> 01:07:33.680]   Is it sin or is it not sin?
[01:07:33.680 --> 01:07:36.000]   The primary concern that we should have is,
[01:07:36.000 --> 01:07:37.860]   is it from God or not?
[01:07:37.860 --> 01:07:41.160]   Is God pleased with this or not?
[01:07:41.160 --> 01:07:43.360]   Is God glorified with this or not?
[01:07:43.360 --> 01:07:46.160]   That should be our primary concern,
[01:07:46.160 --> 01:07:48.000]   not how much can I get away with,
[01:07:48.000 --> 01:07:49.880]   how much of this world and pleasure
[01:07:49.880 --> 01:07:51.640]   that I can experience
[01:07:51.640 --> 01:07:55.160]   while not being judged by the living God.
[01:07:55.160 --> 01:07:58.280]   That's what complicates our decision making.
[01:07:58.280 --> 01:08:01.960]   But if we are committed to Christ
[01:08:01.960 --> 01:08:05.360]   and we are surrendered and we are crucified,
[01:08:05.360 --> 01:08:06.920]   it's not that complicated.
[01:08:06.920 --> 01:08:11.720]   It's difficult, but it's not that complicated.
[01:08:11.720 --> 01:08:13.960]   Fight the good fight.
[01:08:13.960 --> 01:08:15.440]   Take hold of the eternal life
[01:08:15.440 --> 01:08:16.480]   to which you were called
[01:08:16.480 --> 01:08:17.800]   and you made the good confession
[01:08:17.800 --> 01:08:19.400]   in the presence of many witnesses.
[01:08:19.400 --> 01:08:21.280]   That's why it says in 1 Timothy 3:3
[01:08:21.280 --> 01:08:24.660]   that elders must flee from the love of money.
[01:08:24.660 --> 01:08:30.480]   An elder who is holding on to that,
[01:08:30.480 --> 01:08:32.080]   allowing the love of money,
[01:08:32.080 --> 01:08:34.200]   concern for money, concern for safety,
[01:08:34.200 --> 01:08:35.320]   concern for this,
[01:08:35.320 --> 01:08:38.160]   how is that not gonna translate
[01:08:38.160 --> 01:08:39.400]   into the way we run the church,
[01:08:39.400 --> 01:08:41.140]   how we make decisions?
[01:08:41.140 --> 01:08:44.120]   That's why it says an elder must flee
[01:08:44.120 --> 01:08:44.980]   from the love of money.
[01:08:44.980 --> 01:08:48.020]   Matthew 6:24, no one can serve two masters,
[01:08:48.020 --> 01:08:49.700]   for either he will hate the one
[01:08:49.700 --> 01:08:50.680]   and love the other,
[01:08:50.680 --> 01:08:52.080]   or he will be devoted to one
[01:08:52.080 --> 01:08:52.980]   and despise the other.
[01:08:52.980 --> 01:08:54.720]   You cannot serve God.
[01:08:54.720 --> 01:08:57.160]   You cannot.
[01:08:57.160 --> 01:08:59.920]   How many people professing to be Christians
[01:08:59.920 --> 01:09:02.860]   are living their lives to prove God wrong?
[01:09:02.860 --> 01:09:04.840]   I'll show you.
[01:09:04.840 --> 01:09:07.760]   I'm gonna serve God and money.
[01:09:07.760 --> 01:09:10.560]   I'll show you.
[01:09:10.560 --> 01:09:13.040]   How many Christians are living their lives
[01:09:13.040 --> 01:09:15.600]   dedicated to prove God wrong?
[01:09:15.600 --> 01:09:18.780]   And I guarantee you 100%,
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:19.820]   you're gonna wake up one day
[01:09:19.820 --> 01:09:21.040]   and say God was right.
[01:09:21.040 --> 01:09:24.900]   You're gonna find yourself
[01:09:24.900 --> 01:09:27.420]   making decisions that will lead you
[01:09:27.420 --> 01:09:28.300]   away from God,
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.980]   word of God choked in your life,
[01:09:29.980 --> 01:09:33.620]   and you have deliberated,
[01:09:33.620 --> 01:09:35.820]   you have forsaken your first love.
[01:09:35.820 --> 01:09:39.940]   God warned the nation of Israel.
[01:09:41.300 --> 01:09:44.000]   The greatest struggle for the nation of Israel
[01:09:44.000 --> 01:09:46.880]   was when they are blessed.
[01:09:46.880 --> 01:09:49.240]   He said when you go into the promised land
[01:09:49.240 --> 01:09:50.200]   and your food is paid
[01:09:50.200 --> 01:09:52.480]   and your enemy is conquered,
[01:09:52.480 --> 01:09:54.080]   he says you're gonna become proud,
[01:09:54.080 --> 01:09:55.920]   verse 14, Deuteronomy 8,
[01:09:55.920 --> 01:09:57.800]   and you will forget the Lord your God
[01:09:57.800 --> 01:09:59.720]   who brought you out from the land of Egypt,
[01:09:59.720 --> 01:10:01.460]   out of the house of slavery.
[01:10:01.460 --> 01:10:04.320]   He says the temptation's not gonna come
[01:10:04.320 --> 01:10:05.240]   because of your enemies.
[01:10:05.240 --> 01:10:06.460]   The temptation's not gonna come
[01:10:06.460 --> 01:10:08.600]   because of hardship.
[01:10:08.600 --> 01:10:11.780]   Temptation's gonna come when your bills are paid,
[01:10:11.780 --> 01:10:14.100]   when your children are taken care of,
[01:10:14.100 --> 01:10:15.740]   when you have all the freedom in the world
[01:10:15.740 --> 01:10:17.620]   to establish worship,
[01:10:17.620 --> 01:10:19.340]   and then you become proud
[01:10:19.340 --> 01:10:21.300]   when God is no longer your need
[01:10:21.300 --> 01:10:23.420]   and simply a want,
[01:10:23.420 --> 01:10:24.980]   and when pride comes in,
[01:10:24.980 --> 01:10:26.600]   you're gonna forget God.
[01:10:26.600 --> 01:10:28.180]   Now, did the nation of Israel forget,
[01:10:28.180 --> 01:10:30.500]   like I don't know who Yahweh is?
[01:10:30.500 --> 01:10:31.620]   Is that what happened?
[01:10:31.620 --> 01:10:34.060]   What does he mean by forget God?
[01:10:34.060 --> 01:10:36.220]   He's no longer at the center of their camp.
[01:10:37.940 --> 01:10:39.840]   He's somebody that's important,
[01:10:39.840 --> 01:10:42.040]   but he's not the cause of their life.
[01:10:42.040 --> 01:10:45.380]   He's somebody that they need
[01:10:45.380 --> 01:10:46.420]   when they are desperate
[01:10:46.420 --> 01:10:48.580]   and they got no other way to turn,
[01:10:48.580 --> 01:10:50.200]   but he's not their refuge.
[01:10:50.200 --> 01:10:53.840]   That's exactly what happens in Hosea 13, six,
[01:10:53.840 --> 01:10:55.400]   when God warns the nation of Israel,
[01:10:55.400 --> 01:10:56.660]   judgment is coming,
[01:10:56.660 --> 01:11:01.160]   and all of Hosea is summarized in this statement.
[01:11:01.160 --> 01:11:03.220]   As they had their pasture,
[01:11:03.220 --> 01:11:05.080]   they became satisfied,
[01:11:05.080 --> 01:11:06.280]   and being satisfied,
[01:11:06.280 --> 01:11:07.520]   their hearts became proud,
[01:11:07.520 --> 01:11:08.960]   therefore they forgot me,
[01:11:08.960 --> 01:11:10.980]   exactly as God warned them,
[01:11:10.980 --> 01:11:12.800]   and that's exactly what happened
[01:11:12.800 --> 01:11:14.000]   to the nation of Israel.
[01:11:14.000 --> 01:11:18.600]   Finally, it says the desire for things.
[01:11:18.600 --> 01:11:21.480]   That's what it says in the Gospel of Mark,
[01:11:21.480 --> 01:11:24.280]   or in Luke, it says pleasures of this life.
[01:11:24.280 --> 01:11:27.560]   How much of people,
[01:11:27.560 --> 01:11:29.600]   the word of God is just being choked
[01:11:29.600 --> 01:11:32.400]   simply because you are so committed
[01:11:32.400 --> 01:11:34.080]   to the pleasures of life?
[01:11:34.080 --> 01:11:35.960]   Now, that may not be sinful,
[01:11:36.960 --> 01:11:39.320]   but you're always filled.
[01:11:39.320 --> 01:11:43.980]   When you come into this service,
[01:11:43.980 --> 01:11:45.280]   some of you,
[01:11:45.280 --> 01:11:48.080]   I don't know if the Dodgers are playing today,
[01:11:48.080 --> 01:11:49.380]   some of you are already thinking like,
[01:11:49.380 --> 01:11:50.320]   are they gonna win?
[01:11:50.320 --> 01:11:55.920]   Or maybe you made plans to go to Disneyland, right?
[01:11:55.920 --> 01:11:59.520]   This guy better finish his sermon,
[01:11:59.520 --> 01:12:01.000]   'cause if I get there five minutes late,
[01:12:01.000 --> 01:12:03.080]   I'm not gonna get parking, right?
[01:12:04.360 --> 01:12:06.120]   Or maybe this boba store is gonna,
[01:12:06.120 --> 01:12:07.160]   new one open up,
[01:12:07.160 --> 01:12:08.680]   if I go there five minutes late,
[01:12:08.680 --> 01:12:10.840]   that line's gonna be a little bit longer than normal.
[01:12:10.840 --> 01:12:12.440]   Whatever it is,
[01:12:12.440 --> 01:12:13.960]   whatever it is that we're entangled with,
[01:12:13.960 --> 01:12:17.560]   those have consumed our mind and our heart,
[01:12:17.560 --> 01:12:19.840]   and so the word of God is not penetrating,
[01:12:19.840 --> 01:12:25.680]   'cause you're here to fill the time, right?
[01:12:25.680 --> 01:12:30.120]   So we have an unseen covenant each Sunday,
[01:12:30.120 --> 01:12:32.180]   one hour, 15 minutes.
[01:12:33.160 --> 01:12:37.480]   Beyond that, you're robbing my life, right?
[01:12:37.480 --> 01:12:39.760]   Whatever it is that you're pursuing.
[01:12:39.760 --> 01:12:41.040]   1 John 2, 15 to 16,
[01:12:41.040 --> 01:12:42.800]   "Do not love the world, nor the things of the world.
[01:12:42.800 --> 01:12:43.880]   "If anyone loves the world,
[01:12:43.880 --> 01:12:45.640]   "the love of the Father is not in him.
[01:12:45.640 --> 01:12:46.800]   "For all that is in the world,
[01:12:46.800 --> 01:12:48.380]   "the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes,
[01:12:48.380 --> 01:12:49.420]   "and the boastful pride of life
[01:12:49.420 --> 01:12:52.120]   "is not from the Father, but is from the world."
[01:12:52.120 --> 01:12:54.480]   The world is not neutral to God.
[01:12:54.480 --> 01:12:59.080]   The God of this world uses entertainment
[01:12:59.080 --> 01:13:02.120]   to draw you away from God,
[01:13:02.120 --> 01:13:04.700]   so that there is no space for God in your life.
[01:13:04.700 --> 01:13:06.560]   It's not because you have rejected God,
[01:13:06.560 --> 01:13:09.400]   it's because you have already filled your life
[01:13:09.400 --> 01:13:12.500]   with pleasures, and so when the word of God goes out,
[01:13:12.500 --> 01:13:13.700]   there's no room.
[01:13:13.700 --> 01:13:16.220]   You already came into the room filled.
[01:13:16.220 --> 01:13:19.920]   So it's not that you are rejecting God,
[01:13:19.920 --> 01:13:22.540]   but the word of God has no room in your life.
[01:13:22.540 --> 01:13:26.760]   The world is not neutral.
[01:13:26.760 --> 01:13:31.820]   The Bible clearly tells us that God of this age,
[01:13:31.820 --> 01:13:33.680]   blinds the unbelievers so that they do not see
[01:13:33.680 --> 01:13:35.400]   the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[01:13:35.400 --> 01:13:37.340]   You know what that means?
[01:13:37.340 --> 01:13:39.940]   The word of God is not penetrating.
[01:13:39.940 --> 01:13:42.800]   And the way that they do that is fill you
[01:13:42.800 --> 01:13:45.120]   with things that have nothing to do with God,
[01:13:45.120 --> 01:13:46.640]   so that when the word of God comes,
[01:13:46.640 --> 01:13:48.120]   there's no room to get in.
[01:13:48.120 --> 01:13:52.980]   How much of the people in the church
[01:13:52.980 --> 01:13:57.840]   simply drift away from God, and accept that as normal.
[01:13:57.840 --> 01:14:00.740]   Your first love was forsaken many years ago,
[01:14:00.740 --> 01:14:03.080]   but because that's all you see around you,
[01:14:03.080 --> 01:14:05.840]   you've accepted that as normal Christian life,
[01:14:05.840 --> 01:14:10.220]   and you've made cultural Christianity, Christianity.
[01:14:10.220 --> 01:14:15.000]   When was the last time you actually examined yourself?
[01:14:15.000 --> 01:14:17.080]   Do I believe this?
[01:14:17.080 --> 01:14:19.920]   And if I actually believe this, is my life,
[01:14:19.920 --> 01:14:22.520]   is my decision making, is the way that I look at finance,
[01:14:22.520 --> 01:14:25.040]   what I pursue, what I get entertained by,
[01:14:25.040 --> 01:14:28.380]   is it consistent with somebody who professes these things?
[01:14:29.240 --> 01:14:32.800]   I want to remind you of this.
[01:14:32.800 --> 01:14:39.640]   When Eve fell, Eve didn't fall because Satan came
[01:14:39.640 --> 01:14:41.640]   and shook his fist and said, "If you don't follow me,
[01:14:41.640 --> 01:14:46.240]   "if you don't subject yourself to me, I will destroy you."
[01:14:46.240 --> 01:14:47.480]   That's not how they felt.
[01:14:47.480 --> 01:14:51.280]   In Genesis 3, 6, it says, "When the woman saw
[01:14:51.280 --> 01:14:53.340]   "that the tree was good for food,
[01:14:53.340 --> 01:14:58.200]   "and that it was a delight to the eyes."
[01:14:58.200 --> 01:15:02.260]   "And that the tree was desirable to make one wise.
[01:15:02.260 --> 01:15:03.600]   "She took from its fruit and ate,
[01:15:03.600 --> 01:15:07.340]   "and she gave also to her husband with her, and he ate."
[01:15:07.340 --> 01:15:09.420]   The fall of mankind did not come as a threat.
[01:15:09.420 --> 01:15:11.640]   It wasn't because of a persecution.
[01:15:11.640 --> 01:15:14.660]   It was simply a promise for pleasure,
[01:15:14.660 --> 01:15:17.800]   'cause it was good to eat.
[01:15:17.800 --> 01:15:23.780]   It was good to watch, and it's going to raise my status.
[01:15:24.900 --> 01:15:28.400]   And as a result of that, mankind fell.
[01:15:28.400 --> 01:15:32.060]   If you look at the judgment of the nation of Israel,
[01:15:32.060 --> 01:15:34.220]   they split between north and the southern kingdom.
[01:15:34.220 --> 01:15:36.860]   The northern kingdom is taken by a brutal enemy,
[01:15:36.860 --> 01:15:37.880]   the Assyrians.
[01:15:37.880 --> 01:15:41.660]   They would cut off their hands and cut off their head
[01:15:41.660 --> 01:15:44.700]   and pile it up so that whoever was remaining
[01:15:44.700 --> 01:15:47.220]   would live in fear of the Assyrians.
[01:15:47.220 --> 01:15:51.220]   But the greatest threat to the nation of Israel
[01:15:51.220 --> 01:15:56.060]   was not Assyria, because Assyria, what they did,
[01:15:56.060 --> 01:15:58.620]   caused them to fear and run to God.
[01:15:58.620 --> 01:16:03.620]   If anything, it would bring revival because of fear.
[01:16:03.620 --> 01:16:05.700]   But that's not how the devil comes to us.
[01:16:05.700 --> 01:16:10.180]   You know how the Bible describes the end times?
[01:16:10.180 --> 01:16:13.540]   It doesn't say, "Beware of Assyria."
[01:16:13.540 --> 01:16:17.420]   He says, "Beware of the Babylonians."
[01:16:17.420 --> 01:16:21.140]   Babylonians came and took the southern kingdom
[01:16:21.140 --> 01:16:23.600]   into captivity, but the Babylonians
[01:16:23.600 --> 01:16:25.500]   had a completely different philosophy.
[01:16:25.500 --> 01:16:27.580]   We're going to give them status,
[01:16:27.580 --> 01:16:29.160]   we're going to give them citizenship,
[01:16:29.160 --> 01:16:30.740]   we're going to make life great for them.
[01:16:30.740 --> 01:16:34.260]   So when God calls a nation of Israel to go back to Jerusalem
[01:16:34.260 --> 01:16:37.740]   to rebuild the temple, almost nobody comes.
[01:16:37.740 --> 01:16:42.840]   Because they've so assimilated to Babylon.
[01:16:43.900 --> 01:16:48.820]   That why risk, why risk harm, why risk danger
[01:16:48.820 --> 01:16:50.500]   when they've already found status
[01:16:50.500 --> 01:16:53.260]   and citizenship in Babylon?
[01:16:53.260 --> 01:16:55.700]   So when you look at the book of Revelation,
[01:16:55.700 --> 01:16:57.300]   it doesn't warn us about Assyria,
[01:16:57.300 --> 01:16:59.260]   it warns us about Babylon.
[01:16:59.260 --> 01:17:06.160]   The greatest struggle in the church is Babylon.
[01:17:06.160 --> 01:17:11.000]   And that's why it tells us that the third soil,
[01:17:12.820 --> 01:17:15.780]   the third soil, which is very difficult to discern
[01:17:15.780 --> 01:17:20.000]   because every Christian wrestles with it to some degree.
[01:17:20.000 --> 01:17:24.740]   But the difference between a Christian and a non-Christian
[01:17:24.740 --> 01:17:28.660]   is a Christian will hear, they will heed,
[01:17:28.660 --> 01:17:31.880]   they will recognize, and then they will follow.
[01:17:31.880 --> 01:17:35.900]   A non-Christian has accepted.
[01:17:35.900 --> 01:17:40.020]   Their hearts have become cold,
[01:17:40.020 --> 01:17:42.940]   they haven't truly worshiped God for years,
[01:17:42.940 --> 01:17:46.720]   the word of God is being choked, there is no fruit,
[01:17:46.720 --> 01:17:50.620]   people are surprised when you say you're a Christian,
[01:17:50.620 --> 01:17:53.180]   and then you hear the word of God,
[01:17:53.180 --> 01:17:54.860]   and you just close the door.
[01:17:54.860 --> 01:17:58.080]   And you just continue on that path.
[01:17:58.080 --> 01:18:04.700]   If that's you, if that's you, this warning is for you.
[01:18:06.900 --> 01:18:11.900]   I pray, I pray that our church would truly be Bereans,
[01:18:11.900 --> 01:18:16.700]   not simply by name.
[01:18:16.700 --> 01:18:19.720]   Test, test what is being said.
[01:18:19.720 --> 01:18:22.720]   Rejecting me is easy.
[01:18:22.720 --> 01:18:28.580]   But if anything I said is true in the word of God,
[01:18:28.580 --> 01:18:31.720]   simply being at church is not enough.
[01:18:31.720 --> 01:18:35.500]   And let me conclude with this.
[01:18:35.500 --> 01:18:39.300]   Some of you guys may have read news that Richard Dawkins,
[01:18:39.300 --> 01:18:42.140]   he's probably the most famous atheist of our generation.
[01:18:42.140 --> 01:18:46.400]   He wrote a popular book called God Delusion,
[01:18:46.400 --> 01:18:49.180]   and so everybody knows he's the most well-known atheist
[01:18:49.180 --> 01:18:53.220]   in our generation, and recently he said he is very concerned
[01:18:53.220 --> 01:18:56.980]   about how the Islamic faith is penetrating into his country.
[01:18:56.980 --> 01:18:59.240]   And so they're talking about
[01:18:59.240 --> 01:19:01.200]   replacing Christmas with Ramadan.
[01:19:01.200 --> 01:19:04.980]   So he came out disturbed, and this is what,
[01:19:04.980 --> 01:19:07.260]   this is an atheist who lives his whole life
[01:19:07.260 --> 01:19:10.380]   debating Christians and religion, and this is what he says.
[01:19:10.380 --> 01:19:14.260]   I love hymns, I love Christmas carols,
[01:19:14.260 --> 01:19:17.220]   I feel home in the Christian ethos.
[01:19:17.220 --> 01:19:20.980]   I feel that we are a Christian nation,
[01:19:20.980 --> 01:19:22.620]   and he wants to keep it that way.
[01:19:22.620 --> 01:19:25.380]   But let me make a distinction.
[01:19:25.380 --> 01:19:30.260]   I am a cultural Christian, not a believing Christian.
[01:19:31.620 --> 01:19:36.280]   He wants the Christian values without genuine faith.
[01:19:36.280 --> 01:19:40.860]   How many people in the church
[01:19:40.860 --> 01:19:45.560]   are cultural Christians without faith?
[01:19:45.560 --> 01:19:50.860]   I pray that the word of God
[01:19:50.860 --> 01:19:55.700]   would cause you to open your ears,
[01:19:55.700 --> 01:19:59.700]   examine yourself, and pray with all my heart
[01:20:00.940 --> 01:20:03.020]   that you would follow Christ.
[01:20:03.020 --> 01:20:08.320]   Nothing else will satisfy.
[01:20:08.320 --> 01:20:13.060]   You cannot come halfway and wonder why
[01:20:13.060 --> 01:20:14.480]   it's so hard to worship.
[01:20:14.480 --> 01:20:19.740]   You cannot come halfway and wonder why it's so hard to pray.
[01:20:19.740 --> 01:20:22.580]   You cannot half-hearted, committed to Christ,
[01:20:22.580 --> 01:20:24.500]   and wonder why you're not bearing fruit.
[01:20:24.500 --> 01:20:29.140]   You must come all the way to Christ, all the way to Christ.
[01:20:29.140 --> 01:20:31.060]   You cannot just sip on the living water,
[01:20:31.060 --> 01:20:32.620]   you must drink of the living water.
[01:20:32.620 --> 01:20:34.500]   You cannot just taste the bread of life,
[01:20:34.500 --> 01:20:36.220]   you must eat of the bread of life,
[01:20:36.220 --> 01:20:38.940]   that we may bear fruit
[01:20:38.940 --> 01:20:42.700]   and bring the greatest glory to God in our life.
[01:20:42.700 --> 01:20:43.540]   Let's pray.
[01:20:43.540 --> 01:20:53.400]   Father, you are worthy of all our praise.
[01:20:53.400 --> 01:20:55.060]   You are worthy of our worship.
[01:20:55.060 --> 01:20:56.920]   You are worthy of our finances.
[01:20:56.920 --> 01:20:58.580]   You are worthy of our youth.
[01:20:58.580 --> 01:21:01.780]   You are worthy of our whole life.
[01:21:01.780 --> 01:21:06.860]   Help us, Lord God, in our weak faith
[01:21:06.860 --> 01:21:09.940]   to follow you, to persevere in you,
[01:21:09.940 --> 01:21:12.420]   and to bear much fruit for the sake of your glory.
[01:21:12.420 --> 01:21:14.660]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:21:14.660 --> 01:21:16.760]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:21:16.760 --> 01:21:21.240]   (gentle music)
[01:21:21.240 --> 01:21:23.240]   the Lord is with you.
[01:21:23.240 --> 01:21:25.820]   (gentle music)
[01:21:25.820 --> 01:21:30.820]  ,
[01:21:30.820 --> 01:21:35.820]  ,
[01:21:35.820 --> 01:21:40.820]  ,
[01:21:40.820 --> 01:21:45.820]  ,
[01:21:45.820 --> 01:22:05.820]   Jesus, your mercy is all my plea.
[01:22:05.820 --> 01:22:10.580]   I have no defense, my guilt runs too deep.
[01:22:10.580 --> 01:22:16.820]   The best of my works is your hands and your feet.
[01:22:16.820 --> 01:22:30.820]   Jesus, your mercy is all my plea.
[01:22:30.820 --> 01:22:35.820]   Jesus, your mercy is all my praise.
[01:22:35.820 --> 01:22:40.820]   The burdens I bear in the grounds of my home
[01:22:40.820 --> 01:22:46.820]   will never run out until God I behold.
[01:22:46.820 --> 01:22:55.820]   Jesus, your mercy is all my prayer.
[01:22:55.820 --> 01:23:00.820]   Christ, the King who bore my sin,
