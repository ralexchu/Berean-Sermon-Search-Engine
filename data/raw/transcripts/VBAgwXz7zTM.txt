[00:12:42.320 --> 00:13:03.320]   - Good morning, Church family.
[00:13:03.320 --> 00:13:05.320]   Happy Lord's Day and hello as well
[00:13:05.320 --> 00:13:06.320]   to all those joining us online.
[00:13:06.320 --> 00:13:08.320]   What a joy and privilege for us
[00:13:08.320 --> 00:13:11.320]   to gather together outside to worship our God.
[00:13:11.320 --> 00:13:15.320]   Throughout history, God's church has been a singing church.
[00:13:15.320 --> 00:13:18.320]   Not just singing to God, but singing to each other.
[00:13:18.320 --> 00:13:21.320]   As we recently studied in Ephesians 5, 19 to 20,
[00:13:21.320 --> 00:13:24.320]   Paul commands the church, encourages the church
[00:13:24.320 --> 00:13:27.320]   to speak to each other through hymns, through psalms,
[00:13:27.320 --> 00:13:30.320]   making music to each other,
[00:13:30.320 --> 00:13:33.320]   singing with gladness in our hearts to God.
[00:13:33.320 --> 00:13:36.320]   So that is what we want to do this morning.
[00:13:36.320 --> 00:13:39.320]   As you've seen, the words will be on the app,
[00:13:39.320 --> 00:13:41.320]   so if you don't have the words with you, it's on the app,
[00:13:41.320 --> 00:13:42.320]   so if you want to pull that out,
[00:13:42.320 --> 00:13:45.320]   we'll give you 30 seconds to do that.
[00:13:45.320 --> 00:13:48.320]   And then we'll begin with the time of worship.

[00:18:12.320 --> 00:18:18.320]   - All right, good morning.
[00:18:18.320 --> 00:18:20.320]   Good morning, Green Community Church.
[00:18:20.320 --> 00:18:24.320]   Okay, before we begin, let me first say happy birthday
[00:18:24.320 --> 00:18:27.320]   to some of our special people who are at home.
[00:18:27.320 --> 00:18:30.320]   We forgot to say happy birthday last week.
[00:18:30.320 --> 00:18:33.320]   We have Edison Lee who is turning three this week.
[00:18:33.320 --> 00:18:35.320]   Hudson Young, happy birthday.
[00:18:35.320 --> 00:18:38.320]   Emma English, turning five.
[00:18:38.320 --> 00:18:41.320]   Carol Cho is turning five today.
[00:18:41.320 --> 00:18:44.320]   And then Harvey Kim is turning four.
[00:18:44.320 --> 00:18:46.320]   Okay, happy birthday to all of you.
[00:18:46.320 --> 00:18:49.320]   Sorry we missed some of you guys last week.
[00:18:49.320 --> 00:18:51.320]   Hopefully we'll be able to continue this.
[00:18:51.320 --> 00:18:54.320]   Before we get started, again, obviously, you know,
[00:18:54.320 --> 00:18:57.320]   we kind of had to scramble to get this ready.
[00:18:57.320 --> 00:18:59.320]   So don't look at the details.
[00:18:59.320 --> 00:19:02.320]   As long as there's enough shade for you, that's enough.
[00:19:02.320 --> 00:19:05.320]   Okay, so hopefully we can get the kinks out for next
[00:19:05.320 --> 00:19:07.320]   week.
[00:19:07.320 --> 00:19:10.320]   We don't know how long we're going to be in this
[00:19:10.320 --> 00:19:12.320]   situation.
[00:19:12.320 --> 00:19:15.320]   But some people may ask why are we going through all
[00:19:15.320 --> 00:19:18.320]   this hassle to be able to meet physically.
[00:19:18.320 --> 00:19:21.320]   Hopefully God tells us we can get back together.
[00:19:21.320 --> 00:19:24.320]   The corporate gathering of the church should not be
[00:19:24.320 --> 00:19:26.320]   so easily removed.
[00:19:26.320 --> 00:19:29.320]   In Hebrew chapter 10, 22-25, the passage we're going
[00:19:29.320 --> 00:19:32.320]   to be getting to soon says this.
[00:19:32.320 --> 00:19:35.320]   Let us hold fast the confession of our hope without
[00:19:35.320 --> 00:19:37.320]   wavering.
[00:19:37.320 --> 00:19:40.320]   The concern we have right now, according to the
[00:19:40.320 --> 00:19:43.320]   statistics, the Barna report has come out and they
[00:19:43.320 --> 00:19:46.320]   said among the millennials, which would be a large
[00:19:46.320 --> 00:19:49.320]   part of our church, over 35% of people who regularly
[00:19:49.320 --> 00:19:52.320]   attended church before the lockdown have already
[00:19:52.320 --> 00:19:55.320]   moved away from their faith and they're not attending
[00:19:55.320 --> 00:19:57.320]   church anymore.
[00:19:57.320 --> 00:19:59.320]   That's just the millennials.
[00:19:59.320 --> 00:20:02.320]   I know even those who don't fall under that category,
[00:20:02.320 --> 00:20:04.320]   many people have drifted away already.
[00:20:04.320 --> 00:20:07.320]   Those are people who have physically left it.
[00:20:07.320 --> 00:20:10.320]   These are people who were attending church before the
[00:20:10.320 --> 00:20:12.320]   lockdown are no longer attending church.
[00:20:12.320 --> 00:20:14.320]   35%.
[00:20:14.320 --> 00:20:16.320]   That's a huge percentage.
[00:20:16.320 --> 00:20:19.320]   Those are people who physically moved on.
[00:20:19.320 --> 00:20:22.320]   Then there is a large portion of people who have
[00:20:22.320 --> 00:20:24.320]   spiritually drifted away.
[00:20:24.320 --> 00:20:27.320]   There is a reason why the Bible tells us not to
[00:20:27.320 --> 00:20:29.320]   neglect gathering together.
[00:20:29.320 --> 00:20:32.320]   In Hebrews chapter 10, 22-25, the people were
[00:20:32.320 --> 00:20:35.320]   undergoing persecution and hardship was happening and
[00:20:35.320 --> 00:20:38.320]   there was serious consequence for their gathering
[00:20:38.320 --> 00:20:40.320]   because the persecution was intense.
[00:20:40.320 --> 00:20:43.320]   They actually had Roman guards who were looking for
[00:20:43.320 --> 00:20:45.320]   Christians gathering, looking for Christian leaders,
[00:20:45.320 --> 00:20:48.320]   Christian gatherings so they can put them in prison
[00:20:48.320 --> 00:20:51.320]   and obviously cause physical harm in order to stop the
[00:20:51.320 --> 00:20:53.320]   movement of the gospel.
[00:20:53.320 --> 00:20:56.320]   So because there was tremendous fear, people were
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:20:58.320]   beginning to neglect coming together.
[00:20:58.320 --> 00:21:01.320]   Obviously, we're not in the same situation where there
[00:21:01.320 --> 00:21:04.320]   is a concern of this disease that is spreading and we
[00:21:04.320 --> 00:21:06.320]   want to be careful about that.
[00:21:06.320 --> 00:21:09.320]   But the physical gathering of the church, the corporate
[00:21:09.320 --> 00:21:12.320]   worship should not be something that we should be
[00:21:12.320 --> 00:21:14.320]   kind of fold easily.
[00:21:14.320 --> 00:21:16.320]   So we want to make sure.
[00:21:16.320 --> 00:21:19.320]   That's why we go through all of this because what we
[00:21:19.320 --> 00:21:21.320]   do together, it does matter.
[00:21:21.320 --> 00:21:25.320]   It is not like -- we go online worship, we hear
[00:21:25.320 --> 00:21:27.320]   sermons, we can sing songs.
[00:21:27.320 --> 00:21:30.320]   Yes, it is a good replacement when you cannot gather
[00:21:30.320 --> 00:21:32.320]   together.
[00:21:32.320 --> 00:21:35.320]   But as much as we can, we want to do our best to
[00:21:35.320 --> 00:21:38.320]   signify and to gather together because there is
[00:21:38.320 --> 00:21:41.320]   spiritual significance and God is honored by that.
[00:21:41.320 --> 00:21:45.320]   So even though there may be some risk and we want to
[00:21:45.320 --> 00:21:48.320]   do our best to honor the government that we are
[00:21:48.320 --> 00:21:50.320]   under.
[00:21:50.320 --> 00:21:53.320]   But at the same time, we want the church to understand
[00:21:53.320 --> 00:21:55.320]   the high view of the corporate worship.
[00:21:55.320 --> 00:21:58.320]   So again, verse 25, not forsaking our own assembly
[00:21:58.320 --> 00:22:01.320]   together as it is a habit of some but encouraging one
[00:22:01.320 --> 00:22:03.320]   another.
[00:22:03.320 --> 00:22:06.320]   All the more as you see the day drawing near.
[00:22:06.320 --> 00:22:09.320]   As it becomes more and more difficult to be a
[00:22:09.320 --> 00:22:12.320]   church, we are not only preserving our faith but
[00:22:12.320 --> 00:22:15.320]   we are active in preserving other people's faith.
[00:22:15.320 --> 00:22:18.320]   We are thinking carefully about people who are
[00:22:18.320 --> 00:22:20.320]   drifting.
[00:22:20.320 --> 00:22:23.320]   The people who are in your lives, in our lives that
[00:22:23.320 --> 00:22:25.320]   you know who need encouragement.
[00:22:25.320 --> 00:22:28.320]   So right now everybody is in survival mode and waiting
[00:22:28.320 --> 00:22:30.320]   mode.
[00:22:30.320 --> 00:22:33.320]   But this is the time we really need to engage.
[00:22:33.320 --> 00:22:36.320]   Don't wait for the church to say let's do this
[00:22:36.320 --> 00:22:38.320]   together.
[00:22:38.320 --> 00:22:41.320]   If you have family, friends, brothers and sisters
[00:22:41.320 --> 00:22:44.320]   you have known and haven't talked to in a while, it's
[00:22:44.320 --> 00:22:47.320]   a great opportunity for us to consider how to provoke
[00:22:47.320 --> 00:22:50.320]   one another on toward love and good deeds.
[00:22:50.320 --> 00:22:53.320]   There is a spiritual battle going on and self-survival
[00:22:53.320 --> 00:22:55.320]   is not enough.
[00:22:55.320 --> 00:22:58.320]   This is when the church needs to be sober and think
[00:22:58.320 --> 00:23:00.320]   about what is going on around us.
[00:23:00.320 --> 00:23:03.320]   That's the reason why we are going through what we
[00:23:03.320 --> 00:23:05.320]   are doing.
[00:23:05.320 --> 00:23:08.320]   I want to thank you for the time you have spent this
[00:23:08.320 --> 00:23:10.320]   week.
[00:23:10.320 --> 00:23:12.320]   Again, don't look too carefully.
[00:23:12.320 --> 00:23:15.320]   Just enough so we can have some shade and this cool
[00:23:15.320 --> 00:23:17.320]   breeze feels so good.
[00:23:17.320 --> 00:23:19.320]   I don't know if you can feel it.
[00:23:19.320 --> 00:23:21.320]   I can feel it.
[00:23:21.320 --> 00:23:23.320]   Actually, this is a good amount.
[00:23:23.320 --> 00:23:25.320]   We have enough chairs.
[00:23:25.320 --> 00:23:29.320]   But if you are able to come to the 830 service, I know
[00:23:29.320 --> 00:23:32.320]   some of you cannot, especially the parents with
[00:23:32.320 --> 00:23:35.320]   children, you cannot.
[00:23:35.320 --> 00:23:38.320]   If you are of that age group, 1030 is fine.
[00:23:38.320 --> 00:23:41.320]   But if you are able to come to the 830 service and
[00:23:41.320 --> 00:23:44.320]   there is no reason other than you have to wake up
[00:23:44.320 --> 00:23:47.320]   earlier, we will ask some of you to try to come to
[00:23:47.320 --> 00:23:50.320]   the 830 service because this service is going to get
[00:23:50.320 --> 00:23:52.320]   packed.
[00:23:52.320 --> 00:23:54.320]   1030 is easier.
[00:23:54.320 --> 00:23:57.320]   Some people can't go to any other service but this
[00:23:57.320 --> 00:23:59.320]   one.
[00:23:59.320 --> 00:24:03.320]   We will ask you to come to the 830 service so we can
[00:24:03.320 --> 00:24:05.320]   make more room here.
[00:24:05.320 --> 00:24:07.320]   We have a couple of announcements.
[00:24:07.320 --> 00:24:10.320]   First of all, next Sunday we have our members meeting.
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:12.320]   Please mark that on your calendar.
[00:24:12.320 --> 00:24:15.320]   At 230 after the second service we will have the
[00:24:15.320 --> 00:24:17.320]   members meeting on Zoom.
[00:24:17.320 --> 00:24:20.320]   Then we have a baptism after our worship.
[00:24:20.320 --> 00:24:23.320]   Elise Chen is going to come up and give her testimony
[00:24:23.320 --> 00:24:25.320]   after the worship.
[00:24:25.320 --> 00:24:27.320]   She is going to be baptized.
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:29.320]   Then we have our outreach team.
[00:24:29.320 --> 00:24:32.320]   I think June is going to come up and give the
[00:24:32.320 --> 00:24:34.320]   announcement.
[00:24:34.320 --> 00:24:36.320]   You can use this mic.
[00:24:36.320 --> 00:24:39.320]   >> Good morning, everyone.
[00:24:39.320 --> 00:24:41.320]   Let's see.
[00:24:41.320 --> 00:24:44.320]   This is from our outreach team.
[00:24:44.320 --> 00:24:47.320]   I actually tried to call Hans and Franz to come and
[00:24:47.320 --> 00:24:49.320]   give this announcement.
[00:24:49.320 --> 00:24:52.320]   They told me that all of the flights from Austria were
[00:24:52.320 --> 00:24:54.320]   canceled.
[00:24:54.320 --> 00:24:58.320]   You will have to deal with a less muscular person.
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:01.320]   Our gospel night which had been scheduled for April
[00:25:01.320 --> 00:25:04.320]   but had to be rescheduled because of COVID.
[00:25:04.320 --> 00:25:07.320]   We have rescheduled it now.
[00:25:07.320 --> 00:25:11.320]   It's Saturday, August 29 at 4 p.m. by Zoom.
[00:25:11.320 --> 00:25:14.320]   Please mark that in your calendars.
[00:25:14.320 --> 00:25:18.320]   There is going to be a gospel presentation by one of
[00:25:18.320 --> 00:25:20.320]   our leaders.
[00:25:20.320 --> 00:25:25.320]   Then a Q&A session where people can anonymously text
[00:25:25.320 --> 00:25:27.320]   in questions.
[00:25:27.320 --> 00:25:30.320]   There is going to be a flyer on our church Facebook
[00:25:30.320 --> 00:25:33.320]   page through which we can use to invite people and get
[00:25:33.320 --> 00:25:35.320]   the word out.
[00:25:35.320 --> 00:25:38.320]   We are also sending out a registration form and asking
[00:25:38.320 --> 00:25:41.320]   people who are interested in joining to please register.
[00:25:41.320 --> 00:25:44.320]   By that we will send out the Zoom link.
[00:25:44.320 --> 00:25:46.320]   Bereans can join too.
[00:25:46.320 --> 00:25:51.320]   Everyone is welcome since it's by Zoom.
[00:25:51.320 --> 00:25:55.320]   If you are inviting people, we ask that you please
[00:25:55.320 --> 00:25:57.320]   join with them.
[00:25:57.320 --> 00:25:59.320]   As a friend.
[00:25:59.320 --> 00:26:03.320]   Hopefully this can -- as Pastor Peter has been saying,
[00:26:03.320 --> 00:26:07.320]   with the kind of spiritual battle that we are going
[00:26:07.320 --> 00:26:11.320]   through now and have been going through, this can
[00:26:11.320 --> 00:26:15.320]   really be an opportunity for all of us to join in
[00:26:15.320 --> 00:26:17.320]   this spiritual battle.
[00:26:17.320 --> 00:26:19.320]   Thank you.
[00:26:19.320 --> 00:26:22.320]   >> Again, we want to encourage everybody.
[00:26:22.320 --> 00:26:25.320]   This outreach was scheduled before the lockdown.
[00:26:25.320 --> 00:26:28.320]   They decided to move it online.
[00:26:28.320 --> 00:26:32.320]   We have been really encouraged because we have heard
[00:26:32.320 --> 00:26:36.320]   so many people from our church who online has been
[00:26:36.320 --> 00:26:39.320]   watching and inviting them to watch online.
[00:26:39.320 --> 00:26:43.320]   As much as we are excited about this, we are also
[00:26:43.320 --> 00:26:47.320]   excited about the fact that we are going to be
[00:26:47.320 --> 00:26:49.320]   sharing the gospel.
[00:26:49.320 --> 00:26:52.320]   As much as a lot of people in the church, again,
[00:26:52.320 --> 00:26:55.320]   the universal church has been struggling being online,
[00:26:55.320 --> 00:26:59.320]   there's also been a lot of people who have been very
[00:26:59.320 --> 00:27:02.320]   active in sharing the gospel and bringing people
[00:27:02.320 --> 00:27:04.320]   online to watch the services.
[00:27:04.320 --> 00:27:07.320]   I have heard -- again, I have gotten e-mails from
[00:27:07.320 --> 00:27:09.320]   people.
[00:27:09.320 --> 00:27:12.320]   I have gotten texts saying I have my roommate or
[00:27:12.320 --> 00:27:14.320]   girlfriend online.
[00:27:14.320 --> 00:27:17.320]   A lot of that stuff is going on.
[00:27:17.320 --> 00:27:20.320]   We want to encourage you that just because what we
[00:27:20.320 --> 00:27:23.320]   are doing is different, we don't just watch and wait.
[00:27:23.320 --> 00:27:26.320]   We are -- the new opportunities we have to be
[00:27:26.320 --> 00:27:28.320]   online, to be active in doing that.
[00:27:28.320 --> 00:27:31.320]   You may have family and friends who may not normally
[00:27:31.320 --> 00:27:34.320]   come to something physically, maybe because they are
[00:27:34.320 --> 00:27:37.320]   intimidated, but maybe more open to do so online.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:40.320]   We want you to take advantage of that.
[00:27:40.320 --> 00:27:43.320]   We want you to exercise that, be active and prayerful
[00:27:43.320 --> 00:27:45.320]   about doing that.
[00:27:45.320 --> 00:27:47.320]   Let me pray for us.
[00:27:47.320 --> 00:27:50.320]   Right after we will have the time for offering.
[00:27:50.320 --> 00:27:53.320]   If you brought a physical offering, the box is to my
[00:27:53.320 --> 00:27:55.320]   right and to your left at the door.
[00:27:55.320 --> 00:27:57.320]   Let's pray.
[00:27:57.320 --> 00:28:00.320]   Gracious father, we thank you so much for your
[00:28:00.320 --> 00:28:02.320]   continued love toward us.
[00:28:02.320 --> 00:28:04.320]   We know, father, that you are sovereign.
[00:28:04.320 --> 00:28:07.320]   No matter how chaotic the world around us becomes, we
[00:28:07.320 --> 00:28:11.320]   know that all of this, Lord God, is under your sovereign
[00:28:11.320 --> 00:28:13.320]   control.
[00:28:13.320 --> 00:28:16.320]   Help us, Lord, to anchor ourselves in Christ that we
[00:28:16.320 --> 00:28:19.320]   are not swayed back and forth by every wind of
[00:28:19.320 --> 00:28:21.320]   doctrine, every trend, everything that is going on
[00:28:21.320 --> 00:28:23.320]   around us.
[00:28:23.320 --> 00:28:26.320]   Help us, Lord, God, to know where our life is, our
[00:28:26.320 --> 00:28:29.320]   hope, that we may covet the things, Lord God, that are
[00:28:29.320 --> 00:28:31.320]   eternal and not temporal.
[00:28:31.320 --> 00:28:34.320]   We pray, father, God, that as we have this time of
[00:28:34.320 --> 00:28:37.320]   giving, may it be a true sacrifice, true worship in
[00:28:37.320 --> 00:28:39.320]   spirit and in truth.
[00:28:39.320 --> 00:28:42.320]   We thank you, father, God, and may your grace and your
[00:28:42.320 --> 00:28:45.320]   Holy Spirit through your word bless this time.
[00:28:45.320 --> 00:28:47.320]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:28:47.320 --> 00:28:49.320]   Amen.
