[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.580]   (upbeat music)
[00:00:02.580 --> 00:00:07.480]   - I'm thankful for our new church building
[00:00:07.480 --> 00:00:10.440]   and the cafe that we have now where people can fellowship
[00:00:10.440 --> 00:00:12.680]   and hang out between services.
[00:00:12.680 --> 00:00:17.320]   - Something that I have recently been very thankful for
[00:00:17.320 --> 00:00:22.320]   about God is just that in his grace that he gave us Christ
[00:00:22.320 --> 00:00:26.480]   and that through Christ we have reconciliation with him
[00:00:26.480 --> 00:00:31.160]   and that peace with God enables us to have the peace of God
[00:00:31.160 --> 00:00:33.000]   that surpasses all understanding.
[00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:36.160]   And so that no matter what circumstances we go through
[00:00:36.160 --> 00:00:39.120]   in our lives or whatever trials we have,
[00:00:39.120 --> 00:00:44.120]   that even though we don't know why or what's gonna happen,
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:47.720]   we know that God is holding everything
[00:00:47.720 --> 00:00:49.040]   and sustaining everything together.
[00:00:49.040 --> 00:00:50.480]   So I think that has been something
[00:00:50.480 --> 00:00:52.880]   I'm thankful for this year.
[00:00:52.880 --> 00:00:56.200]   - I'm thankful to be back at Berean
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.240]   and my church community and friends
[00:00:59.240 --> 00:01:01.600]   and I'm thankful for my new job
[00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.840]   and my amazing trainer, Abby.
[00:01:04.840 --> 00:01:09.120]   - I'm thankful for our Bible study,
[00:01:09.120 --> 00:01:13.960]   a whole group that we started a few months back.
[00:01:13.960 --> 00:01:14.800]   It's been really good.
[00:01:14.800 --> 00:01:15.640]   - Thank you.
[00:01:15.640 --> 00:01:19.040]   - Really encouraging, spending time with other families
[00:01:19.040 --> 00:01:22.040]   and singles and studying the word together, it's been good.
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:23.800]   - Ta-da.
[00:01:23.840 --> 00:01:26.080]   (laughing)
[00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:29.520]   - Among the many things I would be thankful for,
[00:01:29.520 --> 00:01:33.200]   I'm most especially thankful for Berean Community Church.
[00:01:33.200 --> 00:01:37.880]   And just over these last 14, 15 years,
[00:01:37.880 --> 00:01:42.880]   I've been able to find a community and a group where I grew
[00:01:42.880 --> 00:01:46.600]   and I was really challenged by my faith.
[00:01:46.600 --> 00:01:50.520]   And just over the years I realized
[00:01:50.520 --> 00:01:52.760]   and I appreciate more like the little things
[00:01:53.760 --> 00:01:56.480]   that I've seen and gone through at this church
[00:01:56.480 --> 00:01:58.960]   and I'm especially grateful for our leaders,
[00:01:58.960 --> 00:02:02.880]   Elder Phillip, Elder Joe and Pastor Peter.
[00:02:02.880 --> 00:02:07.560]   I think with time now I realize
[00:02:07.560 --> 00:02:08.760]   just how much they really put in
[00:02:08.760 --> 00:02:11.440]   and the sacrifice they gave to us in the church.
[00:02:11.440 --> 00:02:16.280]   - So I think this season I realized how thankful I am,
[00:02:16.280 --> 00:02:18.600]   not only for my family, for my husband
[00:02:18.600 --> 00:02:20.280]   and my son and my family,
[00:02:20.280 --> 00:02:23.120]   but I think for the first time I've experienced
[00:02:23.120 --> 00:02:25.440]   what it's like to actually have a church family.
[00:02:25.440 --> 00:02:29.320]   And being so, being a new mom and being a wife and all,
[00:02:29.320 --> 00:02:31.240]   I think I've drawn so much encouragement
[00:02:31.240 --> 00:02:33.120]   from a lot of the moms who are here
[00:02:33.120 --> 00:02:34.680]   because not only do they share
[00:02:34.680 --> 00:02:36.720]   about how amazing it is to have children,
[00:02:36.720 --> 00:02:38.480]   they're very honest about some of the hard things
[00:02:38.480 --> 00:02:39.600]   that you have to go through.
[00:02:39.600 --> 00:02:41.080]   And I think for me as a young mom,
[00:02:41.080 --> 00:02:44.440]   it helped prep me for knowing what to see
[00:02:44.440 --> 00:02:46.520]   and what's coming ahead when it comes to raising my son.
[00:02:46.520 --> 00:02:49.200]   So that's something that I'm extremely,
[00:02:49.200 --> 00:02:51.120]   I love Berean, I tell all my friends to come
[00:02:51.120 --> 00:02:53.200]   even though there are really good churches.
[00:02:53.200 --> 00:02:54.520]   I say, "Well, if you ever wanna come,
[00:02:54.520 --> 00:02:55.640]   "just come check out Berean."
[00:02:55.640 --> 00:02:57.600]   And some of them have, so,
[00:02:57.600 --> 00:02:59.560]   just like the one behind the camera.
[00:02:59.560 --> 00:03:02.800]   But I'm very thankful this season for this church
[00:03:02.800 --> 00:03:05.200]   'cause I've been very blessed by so many people.
[00:03:05.200 --> 00:03:08.840]   - I'm thankful for God and how he's been working
[00:03:08.840 --> 00:03:10.640]   through my life, through his word,
[00:03:10.640 --> 00:03:12.360]   and how it continues to ground me
[00:03:12.360 --> 00:03:15.400]   in the midst of all the craziness of life
[00:03:15.400 --> 00:03:18.160]   and work and Jen and anything else.
[00:03:19.160 --> 00:03:23.320]   - I'm thankful for this church, the community,
[00:03:23.320 --> 00:03:24.680]   and our small group.
[00:03:24.680 --> 00:03:29.480]   And just so many people involved in our life.
[00:03:29.480 --> 00:03:30.840]   Thankful for our marriage.
[00:03:30.840 --> 00:03:35.840]   And just the gospel of Jesus.
[00:03:35.840 --> 00:03:40.320]   I think that's good.
[00:03:40.320 --> 00:03:45.200]   - One thing I've been thankful for specifically this year,
[00:03:45.200 --> 00:03:46.640]   in addition to many other things,
[00:03:46.640 --> 00:03:50.160]   is our college ministry and just seeing their,
[00:03:50.160 --> 00:03:52.080]   just love for the Lord and their desire to grow
[00:03:52.080 --> 00:03:54.280]   and to serve our church and to really be committed
[00:03:54.280 --> 00:03:56.040]   and just really learn what the Bible says.
[00:03:56.040 --> 00:03:58.320]   So, I'm really thankful for them this year.
[00:03:58.320 --> 00:04:02.000]   - I'm thankful for small group
[00:04:02.000 --> 00:04:04.200]   and just the ability to have sisters in community
[00:04:04.200 --> 00:04:07.040]   that are able to encourage me and point me toward Christ.
[00:04:07.040 --> 00:04:09.000]   - I'm thankful for football and the opportunity
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:11.240]   to just meet with other women in the church
[00:04:11.240 --> 00:04:14.880]   and fellowship with them through the sport of the game.
[00:04:14.880 --> 00:04:16.640]   - I am thankful for,
[00:04:16.640 --> 00:04:20.120]   there are a lot of things I'm really thankful for,
[00:04:20.120 --> 00:04:22.560]   but I would say just this past year,
[00:04:22.560 --> 00:04:25.400]   something that's just been something I really appreciated
[00:04:25.400 --> 00:04:26.600]   has just been the church.
[00:04:26.600 --> 00:04:29.680]   I think just this past year,
[00:04:29.680 --> 00:04:31.800]   just being a part of the church
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.560]   and just meeting all the brothers and sisters here
[00:04:34.560 --> 00:04:37.160]   and just really getting to know everybody
[00:04:37.160 --> 00:04:38.640]   has been such a blessing for me.
[00:04:38.640 --> 00:04:41.880]   And yeah, I would say that's probably something
[00:04:41.880 --> 00:04:43.760]   that has really changed my life
[00:04:43.760 --> 00:04:45.760]   and I appreciate the most.
[00:04:45.760 --> 00:04:50.800]   - I'm very thankful that God brought me to US
[00:04:50.800 --> 00:04:51.640]   and
[00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:58.000]   lead me to a deeper knowledge and experience
[00:04:58.000 --> 00:05:00.320]   of his love and faithfulness.
[00:05:00.320 --> 00:05:04.360]   And I'm thankful that God is God
[00:05:04.360 --> 00:05:08.440]   in a time of chaos, weakness and confusion.
[00:05:08.440 --> 00:05:13.200]   And I'm very thankful for the brothers and sisters in Berlin
[00:05:13.200 --> 00:05:18.200]   that your hospitality means a lot to me as a surgeon.
[00:05:18.200 --> 00:05:20.160]   Yes.
[00:05:20.160 --> 00:05:22.400]   - I just want to say I'm thankful for Berlin.
[00:05:22.400 --> 00:05:25.240]   - I'm thankful for my mom.
[00:05:25.240 --> 00:05:28.480]   - Stop it.
[00:05:28.480 --> 00:05:37.560]   [BLANK_AUDIO]
