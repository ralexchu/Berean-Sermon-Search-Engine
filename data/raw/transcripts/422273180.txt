[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.160]   All right, good morning.
[00:00:06.160 --> 00:00:10.840]   We're finally jumping back into Hebrews chapter 7.
[00:00:10.840 --> 00:00:15.160]   I'm encouraged to see how many of you are excited to get back into Hebrews,
[00:00:15.160 --> 00:00:19.440]   especially the study of Melchizedek.
[00:00:19.440 --> 00:00:22.660]   Hopefully your enthusiasm will be the same after we study it
[00:00:22.660 --> 00:00:26.800]   because it is something that really requires your commitment
[00:00:26.800 --> 00:00:30.280]   to work toward understanding.
[00:00:30.280 --> 00:00:36.120]   But it is also really rich in knowing that God had prepared this
[00:00:36.120 --> 00:00:37.600]   deep into the scripture.
[00:00:37.600 --> 00:00:43.880]   And so I think personally when I study about Melchizedek
[00:00:43.880 --> 00:00:47.520]   and what he means in the redemptive history,
[00:00:47.520 --> 00:00:50.600]   you can see God's intricate work that's going on behind the scene
[00:00:50.600 --> 00:00:52.480]   that sometimes we don't see.
[00:00:52.480 --> 00:00:56.240]   And that all of this leads to a greater confidence in who Christ is.
[00:00:56.240 --> 00:00:59.960]   So let me read the passage that we're going to be covering.
[00:00:59.960 --> 00:01:03.480]   And we're going to be in chapter 7 for about at least two to three weeks.
[00:01:03.480 --> 00:01:07.280]   But let me read you the first part of it in verses 1 through 10 before we get in.
[00:01:07.280 --> 00:01:09.800]   Okay.
[00:01:09.800 --> 00:01:13.360]   For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,
[00:01:13.360 --> 00:01:18.140]   who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him,
[00:01:18.140 --> 00:01:22.040]   to whom also Abraham apportioned a tenth part of all the spoils,
[00:01:22.040 --> 00:01:25.800]   was first of all by the translation of his name, king of righteousness,
[00:01:25.800 --> 00:01:29.280]   and also king of Salem, which is king of peace.
[00:01:29.280 --> 00:01:31.560]   Without father, without mother, without genealogy,
[00:01:31.560 --> 00:01:34.080]   having neither beginning of days nor end of life,
[00:01:34.080 --> 00:01:38.480]   but made like the son of God, he remains a priest perpetually.
[00:01:38.480 --> 00:01:41.680]   Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham, the patriarch,
[00:01:41.680 --> 00:01:44.080]   gave a tenth of the choicest spoils.
[00:01:44.080 --> 00:01:47.560]   And those indeed of the sons of Levi who received the priest's office
[00:01:47.560 --> 00:01:52.560]   have commandment in the law to collect a tenth from the people,
[00:01:52.560 --> 00:01:56.400]   that is from their brethren, although these are descended from Abraham.
[00:01:56.400 --> 00:01:58.640]   But the one whose genealogy is not traced from them
[00:01:58.640 --> 00:02:03.300]   collected a tenth from Abraham and blessed the one who had the promises.
[00:02:03.300 --> 00:02:06.020]   But without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater.
[00:02:06.020 --> 00:02:09.280]   In this case, more men receive tithes, but in that case,
[00:02:09.280 --> 00:02:13.120]   one receives them of whom it is witnessed that he lives on.
[00:02:13.120 --> 00:02:18.400]   And so to speak, through Abraham, even Levi, who received his tithes, paid tithes,
[00:02:18.400 --> 00:02:22.640]   for he was still in the loins of his father when Melchizedek met him.
[00:02:22.640 --> 00:02:26.280]   Let's pray.
[00:02:26.280 --> 00:02:29.680]   Heavenly Father, we pray for your blessing.
[00:02:29.680 --> 00:02:36.440]   We pray that the study of Hebrews and specifically the priesthood of Melchizedek
[00:02:36.440 --> 00:02:42.440]   would open our eyes to see your intricate hands of your sovereignty
[00:02:42.440 --> 00:02:47.040]   and how you work together all things according to your good purpose.
[00:02:47.040 --> 00:02:51.000]   So help us, Lord God, to have eyes to see, ears to hear,
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:53.920]   and a heart that can be molded, Lord God, as you desire.
[00:02:53.920 --> 00:02:56.040]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.040]   Amen.
[00:02:57.040 --> 00:03:02.960]   All right, so again, you know, we're living in really crazy times,
[00:03:02.960 --> 00:03:06.640]   and I'm sure some of you have been following the news carefully.
[00:03:06.640 --> 00:03:10.240]   I've literally been watching probably about an hour or more
[00:03:10.240 --> 00:03:13.600]   of different information that comes out every day,
[00:03:13.600 --> 00:03:16.120]   seeing what kind of judgments we're going to make,
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.720]   what is the government saying, what are the numbers,
[00:03:18.720 --> 00:03:20.040]   what's going on around the world.
[00:03:20.040 --> 00:03:23.160]   And so all of this obviously is so that we can have a better grasp
[00:03:23.160 --> 00:03:24.960]   of what to expect going forward.
[00:03:24.960 --> 00:03:28.600]   But right now the information coming out is so all over the place.
[00:03:28.600 --> 00:03:32.440]   I mean, you have the extremes of if we come out, we're going to die,
[00:03:32.440 --> 00:03:35.880]   to all of this is a hoax, is a fake, you know, this doesn't exist.
[00:03:35.880 --> 00:03:38.600]   I mean, it's all over the place.
[00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:40.880]   And some will say, well, science says this,
[00:03:40.880 --> 00:03:43.520]   and the other side will also say science says this,
[00:03:43.520 --> 00:03:46.160]   and they have their own doctors and own professionals,
[00:03:46.160 --> 00:03:49.000]   own experts that will back up whatever they say.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:52.280]   And so it's very difficult to discern, you know,
[00:03:52.280 --> 00:03:54.800]   where do we put our confidence?
[00:03:54.800 --> 00:03:58.600]   And I'm sure we all have our different opinions about all of that.
[00:03:58.600 --> 00:04:01.040]   But from the very get-go, for Christians,
[00:04:01.040 --> 00:04:05.760]   our confidence should have never really been with all of those things.
[00:04:05.760 --> 00:04:11.080]   Because whatever it is that we study, wherever we put our confidence,
[00:04:11.080 --> 00:04:16.480]   if we put our absolute confidence in anything outside of Christ,
[00:04:16.480 --> 00:04:20.320]   eventually it will be exposed for what it is.
[00:04:20.320 --> 00:04:24.920]   Even with the best of intentions, mankind does not have the ability
[00:04:24.920 --> 00:04:28.440]   to have the truth and be consistent all the time.
[00:04:28.440 --> 00:04:32.240]   And so, you know, the reason why I say all of this is because all of this
[00:04:32.240 --> 00:04:35.200]   is really connected to what the author of Hebrews
[00:04:35.200 --> 00:04:38.480]   have been saying about Jesus all the way up to now,
[00:04:38.480 --> 00:04:40.560]   and he will continue to say this.
[00:04:40.560 --> 00:04:44.600]   If you are anchored in anything outside of Christ,
[00:04:44.600 --> 00:04:47.720]   you will already have seen your heart drifted.
[00:04:47.720 --> 00:04:51.360]   And I think, you know, one of the things that this exposed,
[00:04:51.360 --> 00:04:56.880]   this pandemic exposed is, if your heart was already somewhere else,
[00:04:56.880 --> 00:04:58.760]   in the last two to two and a half months,
[00:04:58.760 --> 00:05:03.000]   my guess is many people have already drifted in their faith.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:07.080]   Because whatever they were anchored in wasn't Christ.
[00:05:07.080 --> 00:05:08.800]   As soon as they weren't able to gather,
[00:05:08.800 --> 00:05:14.480]   as soon as there wasn't people or fellowship, they began to drift.
[00:05:14.480 --> 00:05:18.520]   And so as we make our way back into Melchizedek,
[00:05:18.520 --> 00:05:22.040]   I want to make sure that we understand why we're studying this to begin with.
[00:05:22.040 --> 00:05:25.280]   Our main point is not so that we can be better theologians and say,
[00:05:25.280 --> 00:05:27.800]   you know, Melchizedek, Archibald taught about Melchizedek,
[00:05:27.800 --> 00:05:30.520]   and I know who he is, and, you know, you may be able to know
[00:05:30.520 --> 00:05:34.200]   more than 99% of other Christians who this guy is.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.720]   That is not our point.
[00:05:35.720 --> 00:05:40.840]   If you have all that knowledge and it doesn't transform your heart,
[00:05:40.840 --> 00:05:44.000]   your life, your hope, then you've really missed the whole point.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.760]   In fact, it probably does more harm than good to know a lot of theology,
[00:05:48.760 --> 00:05:52.960]   and your head gets bigger, but your life doesn't reflect that.
[00:05:52.960 --> 00:05:55.000]   Well, the study of Melchizedek.
[00:05:55.000 --> 00:05:59.120]   We're in chapter 7, and he's going to be the main character,
[00:05:59.120 --> 00:06:03.000]   and who he is, his priesthood, all the way to chapter 10.
[00:06:03.000 --> 00:06:04.240]   And so we're going to be on this subject.
[00:06:04.240 --> 00:06:06.960]   His name may not be specifically mentioned each week,
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:09.760]   but again, his priesthood and who he is
[00:06:09.760 --> 00:06:12.920]   is going to be the central subject from chapter 7 to 10.
[00:06:12.920 --> 00:06:18.240]   In fact, we can say the meat of the book of Hebrews is between chapter 7 and 10.
[00:06:18.240 --> 00:06:20.200]   That everything that's been happening up to this point
[00:06:20.200 --> 00:06:23.840]   is really to set up for chapter 7, 8, 9, and 10.
[00:06:23.840 --> 00:06:26.280]   Because the argument was, starting from chapter 1,
[00:06:26.280 --> 00:06:29.480]   that Jesus is greater than the angels.
[00:06:29.480 --> 00:06:31.160]   He's greater than the prophets.
[00:06:31.160 --> 00:06:32.360]   He's greater than Moses.
[00:06:32.360 --> 00:06:34.040]   He's greater than Aaron.
[00:06:34.040 --> 00:06:37.440]   And so all of this to say, to pay attention to Christ.
[00:06:37.440 --> 00:06:40.080]   That was his main point.
[00:06:40.080 --> 00:06:44.920]   But the heart of the matter really comes to his priesthood.
[00:06:44.920 --> 00:06:50.640]   Because the natural tendency for a Jew was to drift back into his old way of life
[00:06:50.640 --> 00:06:53.400]   and say, well, Jesus may be a great man, and he fed thousands,
[00:06:53.400 --> 00:06:57.040]   and performed miracles, and maybe he's a great man.
[00:06:57.040 --> 00:07:05.200]   But to a Jew, the temple, the sacrificial system, was his life.
[00:07:05.200 --> 00:07:09.000]   So he may be a great man, but what does that have to do with my life
[00:07:09.000 --> 00:07:10.200]   and my relationship with God?
[00:07:10.200 --> 00:07:16.760]   Well, that's the point that he's trying to get at in chapter 7, 8, and 9, and 10.
[00:07:16.760 --> 00:07:19.640]   But again, I'm going to read some verses with you
[00:07:19.640 --> 00:07:24.680]   before we jump into the three-point that I have this morning.
[00:07:24.680 --> 00:07:28.040]   Melchizedek is not first mentioned in chapter 7.
[00:07:28.040 --> 00:07:31.640]   So I hope some of you who are excited about studying chapter 7
[00:07:31.640 --> 00:07:37.000]   may remember that Melchizedek actually was introduced to us in chapter 5.
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:39.680]   He actually is introduced--
[00:07:39.680 --> 00:07:41.160]   actually, let me read that to you.
[00:07:41.160 --> 00:07:46.080]   In Hebrews chapter 5, 9 through 14, "And having been made perfect,"
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:49.080]   talking about Christ, "he became to all those who obey him
[00:07:49.080 --> 00:07:53.240]   the source of eternal salvation, being designated by God as a high priest
[00:07:53.240 --> 00:07:55.600]   according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:07:55.600 --> 00:07:58.600]   So he actually introduces Melchizedek, right?
[00:07:58.600 --> 00:08:03.040]   That Christ is our high priest according to Melchizedek.
[00:08:03.040 --> 00:08:06.760]   But then in verse 11, he says, "Concerning him, we have much to say,
[00:08:06.760 --> 00:08:10.760]   and it is hard to explain since you have become dull of hearing.
[00:08:10.760 --> 00:08:13.240]   For though by this time you ought to be teachers,
[00:08:13.240 --> 00:08:16.360]   you have need again for someone to teach you the elementary principles
[00:08:16.360 --> 00:08:21.280]   of the oracles of God, and you have come to need milk and not solid food.
[00:08:21.280 --> 00:08:23.960]   For everyone who partakes only of milk is not accustomed
[00:08:23.960 --> 00:08:27.520]   to the word of righteousness, for he is an infant.
[00:08:27.520 --> 00:08:30.760]   But solid food is for the mature who, because of practice,
[00:08:30.760 --> 00:08:34.280]   have their senses trained to discern good and evil."
[00:08:34.280 --> 00:08:38.760]   So even before he gets to chapter 7, he kind of has to pause.
[00:08:38.760 --> 00:08:42.240]   And I'm pretty sure if you've been at a church for any period of time,
[00:08:42.240 --> 00:08:45.200]   any time that I think I'm going to lose you,
[00:08:45.200 --> 00:08:48.760]   you probably kind of remember me saying, hey,
[00:08:48.760 --> 00:08:50.160]   you need to pay attention to this.
[00:08:50.160 --> 00:08:52.680]   Or if you're going to stay awake for any part of the message,
[00:08:52.680 --> 00:08:55.040]   this is the part of the message that you need to pay attention to.
[00:08:55.040 --> 00:08:59.320]   I say all of that because I know it requires soberness
[00:08:59.320 --> 00:09:01.120]   to understand and engage.
[00:09:01.120 --> 00:09:04.120]   And if you just kind of casually listen, there are certain things
[00:09:04.120 --> 00:09:06.720]   that may go over your head, and it's not going to make much sense.
[00:09:06.720 --> 00:09:09.440]   Well, that's what the author is really doing here.
[00:09:09.440 --> 00:09:12.280]   He's going to get into the details of Melchizedek.
[00:09:12.280 --> 00:09:15.200]   There are some parts of what he says about Melchizedek
[00:09:15.200 --> 00:09:18.320]   that if you sit there casually listening, like, you know,
[00:09:18.320 --> 00:09:20.520]   I could talk about the love of God and grace of God,
[00:09:20.520 --> 00:09:24.120]   and all these things are central issues of Christianity,
[00:09:24.120 --> 00:09:26.760]   but you probably heard those messages so many times
[00:09:26.760 --> 00:09:30.840]   that you can kind of casually listen and still get a lot out of it.
[00:09:30.840 --> 00:09:36.280]   Well, Melchizedek, because most people don't know who he is,
[00:09:36.280 --> 00:09:38.080]   most people don't understand who he is,
[00:09:38.080 --> 00:09:40.600]   and most people don't know the significance of who he is
[00:09:40.600 --> 00:09:43.320]   and how he's connected to Christ and his priesthood.
[00:09:43.320 --> 00:09:47.680]   So there's a lot of things that the author is going to say
[00:09:47.680 --> 00:09:52.120]   that if you don't pay attention, if you don't, like, commit to pay attention,
[00:09:52.120 --> 00:09:54.800]   if you go to sleep at four and wake up at seven,
[00:09:54.800 --> 00:09:57.520]   it's probably going to go over your head, okay?
[00:09:57.520 --> 00:10:00.720]   So he takes a break, and after he says that,
[00:10:00.720 --> 00:10:03.440]   "I can't tell you if you're not paying attention
[00:10:03.440 --> 00:10:06.840]   and if you're not committed to this, if you're immature,"
[00:10:06.840 --> 00:10:10.320]   and then he gets to chapter six with a stark warning
[00:10:10.320 --> 00:10:13.920]   that if you've been in the church and you've tasted the goodness of God
[00:10:13.920 --> 00:10:17.000]   and you had all the blessing, all the teaching,
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:19.640]   all the benefits of being in the church,
[00:10:19.640 --> 00:10:22.360]   and yet all of it goes over your head
[00:10:22.360 --> 00:10:25.360]   and you're still drifting back into your old way of life,
[00:10:25.360 --> 00:10:27.320]   he says, "There's no hope for you."
[00:10:27.320 --> 00:10:32.200]   So in other words, all of chapter six is to get them to pay attention.
[00:10:32.200 --> 00:10:33.600]   Here comes the meat.
[00:10:33.600 --> 00:10:36.040]   That's what he was trying to do, right?
[00:10:36.040 --> 00:10:37.040]   Here comes the meat.
[00:10:37.040 --> 00:10:38.880]   "I want to tell you about Melchizedek,
[00:10:38.880 --> 00:10:41.880]   but you really need to commit to this and pay attention.
[00:10:41.880 --> 00:10:46.280]   There's consequences if you just remain as infants."
[00:10:46.280 --> 00:10:48.760]   And then he wraps it up at the end of chapter six
[00:10:48.760 --> 00:10:52.200]   before we get into chapter seven, starting from verse 17.
[00:10:52.200 --> 00:10:53.960]   This is what he says.
[00:10:53.960 --> 00:10:58.200]   "In the same way, God desiring even more to show to the heirs of the promise
[00:10:58.200 --> 00:11:02.640]   the unchangeableness of his purpose interposed with an oath,
[00:11:02.640 --> 00:11:06.320]   so that by two unchangeable things in which it is impossible for God to lie,
[00:11:06.320 --> 00:11:09.360]   we who have taken refuge would have strong encouragement
[00:11:09.360 --> 00:11:12.040]   to take hold of the hope set before us."
[00:11:12.040 --> 00:11:14.120]   Okay, so again, pay attention to that.
[00:11:14.120 --> 00:11:16.680]   The whole reason why he gets into Melchizedek
[00:11:16.680 --> 00:11:21.760]   is to make sure that the hope that we have in Christ is secure.
[00:11:21.760 --> 00:11:23.760]   Are you anchored in Christ?
[00:11:23.760 --> 00:11:25.640]   That's the question.
[00:11:25.640 --> 00:11:27.840]   We're not talking about a piece of paper.
[00:11:27.840 --> 00:11:30.280]   We're not talking about the church that you attend.
[00:11:30.280 --> 00:11:33.400]   We're not talking about the confession of the friends around you.
[00:11:33.400 --> 00:11:36.560]   We're not talking about your upbringing.
[00:11:36.560 --> 00:11:40.080]   Are you firmly anchored in Christ?
[00:11:40.080 --> 00:11:44.400]   And what I'm about to tell you is so that you can examine
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:46.440]   to make sure that you are anchored in Christ.
[00:11:46.440 --> 00:11:48.200]   Okay, in verse 19.
[00:11:48.200 --> 00:11:51.360]   "This hope we have as an anchor of the soul,
[00:11:51.360 --> 00:11:56.920]   a hope both sure and steadfast, and one which enters within the veil,
[00:11:56.920 --> 00:11:59.360]   where Jesus has entered as a forerunner for us,
[00:11:59.360 --> 00:12:04.840]   having become a high priest forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:12:04.840 --> 00:12:08.560]   So I hope you notice that he ends chapter five introducing Melchizedek,
[00:12:08.560 --> 00:12:10.920]   giving a stark warning to pay attention,
[00:12:10.920 --> 00:12:13.600]   and then he goes back at the end of chapter six saying,
[00:12:13.600 --> 00:12:15.560]   "I'm going to talk about Melchizedek now.
[00:12:15.560 --> 00:12:16.760]   Stay with me."
[00:12:16.760 --> 00:12:17.760]   Okay.
[00:12:17.760 --> 00:12:24.600]   Melchizedek is an obscure figure.
[00:12:24.600 --> 00:12:28.760]   My guess is some of you who are listening to this sermon right now
[00:12:28.760 --> 00:12:31.440]   may never have even heard of his name
[00:12:31.440 --> 00:12:37.520]   because he is only mentioned in a few verses in Genesis chapter 14.
[00:12:37.520 --> 00:12:42.080]   And again, in the book of Psalm one time.
[00:12:42.080 --> 00:12:46.720]   So in totality, he's mentioned his name maybe about two or three times.
[00:12:46.720 --> 00:12:52.360]   And yet, three, four, five chapters are dedicated
[00:12:52.360 --> 00:12:57.880]   in that what a huge role he plays in redemptive history.
[00:12:57.880 --> 00:13:01.360]   I mean, it is a huge part he plays.
[00:13:01.360 --> 00:13:03.840]   And that's why, again, so many chapters are dedicated.
[00:13:03.840 --> 00:13:07.720]   And why he spends a whole chapter telling them to watch out
[00:13:07.720 --> 00:13:09.640]   and pay attention even before he gets in.
[00:13:09.640 --> 00:13:13.200]   So just to kind of give you a broad outline since we're jumping back in,
[00:13:13.200 --> 00:13:19.360]   chapter seven is about the superiority of the priesthood of Melchizedek.
[00:13:19.360 --> 00:13:22.520]   Okay, so that's what we're going to be talking about today in a few more weeks.
[00:13:22.520 --> 00:13:26.960]   Chapter eight, "Therefore, because of the superior priesthood,
[00:13:26.960 --> 00:13:31.120]   the superior priesthood introduces a superior covenant."
[00:13:31.120 --> 00:13:32.440]   That's chapter eight.
[00:13:33.440 --> 00:13:36.440]   And in order to have the superior covenant,
[00:13:36.440 --> 00:13:38.680]   there needs to be a superior sanctuary,
[00:13:38.680 --> 00:13:43.240]   meaning that the old system, the whole system of approaching God
[00:13:43.240 --> 00:13:48.760]   has been replaced by a whole new system of priesthood, covenant, and the sanctuary.
[00:13:48.760 --> 00:13:54.000]   And then ultimately, all of this points back to Christ and his ultimate sacrifice.
[00:13:54.000 --> 00:13:59.600]   So chapter 10 is about the superiority of Jesus as the ultimate sacrifice.
[00:13:59.600 --> 00:14:02.640]   Okay, so that's a broad outline that we're going to be covering.
[00:14:02.640 --> 00:14:05.040]   Chapter seven, "Superiority of the priesthood."
[00:14:05.040 --> 00:14:07.520]   Chapter eight, "Superiority of the covenant."
[00:14:07.520 --> 00:14:10.360]   "Superiority of the sanctuary," chapter nine.
[00:14:10.360 --> 00:14:14.600]   And "Superiority of the sacrifice" in chapter 10.
[00:14:14.600 --> 00:14:17.480]   All right, so all of that is an introduction, okay?
[00:14:17.480 --> 00:14:20.240]   So if you fall asleep now, it's completely your fault.
[00:14:20.240 --> 00:14:22.160]   Okay, I've done everything I could.
[00:14:22.160 --> 00:14:25.960]   All right, so we'll see.
[00:14:25.960 --> 00:14:33.240]   The main point today is the superiority of Melchizedek over Abraham.
[00:14:33.240 --> 00:14:36.120]   "Superiority of Melchizedek over Abraham."
[00:14:36.120 --> 00:14:38.800]   And so I have three parts to that.
[00:14:38.800 --> 00:14:44.040]   And so, again, if you are following the outline, you can see, okay?
[00:14:44.040 --> 00:14:46.280]   Hebrews chapter seven, verse one.
[00:14:46.280 --> 00:14:49.840]   "For this Melchizedek, king of Salem, priest of the most high God,
[00:14:49.840 --> 00:14:53.760]   who met Abraham as he was returning from the slaughter of the kings and blessed him."
[00:14:53.760 --> 00:14:56.800]   So let me stop right there, okay?
[00:14:56.800 --> 00:15:03.520]   In order for us to fully appreciate what he says here about Melchizedek being superior
[00:15:03.520 --> 00:15:08.960]   to Abraham, we really have to have a good idea of who Abraham is, okay?
[00:15:08.960 --> 00:15:13.440]   Because without that, again, you might have some loose understanding of who Abraham is.
[00:15:13.440 --> 00:15:19.960]   And without a deeper understanding of who Abraham is, when you hear...you wouldn't hear
[00:15:19.960 --> 00:15:24.160]   like the first century Jews that he's talking to.
[00:15:24.160 --> 00:15:27.960]   Abraham was the father of their nation.
[00:15:27.960 --> 00:15:33.720]   In fact, let me go back early on where Abraham is introduced to us in Genesis chapter 11.
[00:15:33.720 --> 00:15:39.240]   But again, the promise that God makes to Abraham, which is a covenant that he makes
[00:15:39.240 --> 00:15:42.040]   with Abraham to his descendants and ultimately to the rest of the world,
[00:15:42.040 --> 00:15:44.240]   and this is what he says.
[00:15:44.240 --> 00:15:46.720]   "I will make you a great nation," right?
[00:15:46.720 --> 00:15:51.200]   Talking about Abraham and his descendants, "and I will bless you and make your name great.
[00:15:51.200 --> 00:15:55.160]   And so you shall be a blessing, and I will bless those who bless you.
[00:15:55.160 --> 00:15:57.520]   And the one who curses you, I will curse.
[00:15:57.520 --> 00:16:00.800]   And in you, all the families of the earth will be blessed."
[00:16:00.800 --> 00:16:04.800]   Okay, so let me stop right there.
[00:16:04.800 --> 00:16:12.320]   According to the scripture, Abraham is not simply the father of Israel.
[00:16:12.320 --> 00:16:18.080]   Abraham is the source of blessing for mankind.
[00:16:18.080 --> 00:16:22.480]   So if you hear Abraham as, "Well, God started Israel through Abraham,"
[00:16:22.480 --> 00:16:25.320]   it wouldn't really make the kind of impact, what he's saying.
[00:16:25.320 --> 00:16:29.320]   Melchizedek is greater than Abraham, then it should.
[00:16:29.320 --> 00:16:34.680]   Because according to God's promise, all the other nations outside of the blessing of God
[00:16:34.680 --> 00:16:40.640]   can have a great nation, but yet the God of the universe who created all things isn't
[00:16:40.640 --> 00:16:42.760]   blessing them.
[00:16:42.760 --> 00:16:48.520]   So the real blessing that only God can give is going to come through Abraham.
[00:16:48.520 --> 00:16:56.160]   Rest of Israel's history, rest of Old Testament, is the fulfillment of this promise.
[00:16:56.160 --> 00:17:02.720]   Every part of what you study in the Old Testament from a Jewish perspective is the fulfillment
[00:17:02.720 --> 00:17:05.120]   of this promise.
[00:17:05.120 --> 00:17:07.280]   That God is going to, how is he fulfilling this?
[00:17:07.280 --> 00:17:09.000]   How is he multiplying them?
[00:17:09.000 --> 00:17:10.560]   How is he making him great?
[00:17:10.560 --> 00:17:12.880]   How are the other nations being blessed by this?
[00:17:12.880 --> 00:17:19.160]   So the origin of their faith begins with Abraham.
[00:17:19.160 --> 00:17:26.240]   In fact, God calls Abraham and Abraham and his family obeys and they set out on this
[00:17:26.240 --> 00:17:28.880]   journey that God calls them to.
[00:17:28.880 --> 00:17:34.960]   In a short period of time, they become so wealthy, according to Genesis 13, 5 and 6,
[00:17:34.960 --> 00:17:39.000]   that his nephew and Abraham actually has to split.
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:44.480]   So within one chapter, they've accumulated enough wealth where they couldn't even share
[00:17:44.480 --> 00:17:46.640]   the same space.
[00:17:46.640 --> 00:17:53.160]   So this is not like New York, where you got limited apartment space and then you accumulate
[00:17:53.160 --> 00:17:54.160]   certain things.
[00:17:54.160 --> 00:17:56.980]   We're talking about an open field.
[00:17:56.980 --> 00:18:00.160]   We're talking about just acres and acres of land.
[00:18:00.160 --> 00:18:03.320]   That's how wealthy Abraham became.
[00:18:03.320 --> 00:18:08.960]   And so again, the fulfillment of Genesis 12, 1, 2, and 3 that we see right away in chapter
[00:18:08.960 --> 00:18:14.880]   13, that they become so rich and they can't even stay together, so they split.
[00:18:14.880 --> 00:18:21.480]   So Abraham stays in the Canaanite land and Lot chooses to take his goods and he goes
[00:18:21.480 --> 00:18:27.800]   where we know later on Sodom and Gomorrah, they come out and so he settles over there
[00:18:27.800 --> 00:18:30.880]   simply because of space.
[00:18:30.880 --> 00:18:34.700]   Well where Melchizedek comes in is in chapter 14.
[00:18:34.700 --> 00:18:40.840]   In chapter 14, Abraham and Lot, they're just enjoying their life and they're enjoying the
[00:18:40.840 --> 00:18:46.940]   blessing of God, but the kings of the Canaanites, four separate kings, they unite and they go
[00:18:46.940 --> 00:18:52.920]   into battle with the kings near the Sodom and Gomorrah, about five of them.
[00:18:52.920 --> 00:18:57.400]   So those four kings attack them and Lot happens to be on the losing side.
[00:18:57.400 --> 00:19:00.120]   Not that he was in the battle, he just happened to be in the land.
[00:19:00.120 --> 00:19:04.620]   And so the four kings of the Canaanites come and conquer them and they take all their possessions
[00:19:04.620 --> 00:19:07.200]   and they're on their way back.
[00:19:07.200 --> 00:19:12.280]   Abraham hears about this as his nephew has been caught up in this and now he's lost all
[00:19:12.280 --> 00:19:13.280]   of his possessions.
[00:19:13.280 --> 00:19:17.120]   So Abraham gathers his people.
[00:19:17.120 --> 00:19:20.040]   Now again, Abraham is not a nation yet.
[00:19:20.040 --> 00:19:22.840]   He's just a very wealthy man.
[00:19:22.840 --> 00:19:29.220]   But again, it's very important that you understand what's going on historically.
[00:19:29.220 --> 00:19:37.160]   He's going after four kings, four kingdoms, who just defeated five other kings.
[00:19:37.160 --> 00:19:43.280]   And he had enough fighting men to take with him and he actually beats them.
[00:19:43.280 --> 00:19:45.920]   You understand that?
[00:19:45.920 --> 00:19:50.880]   Again, you have to understand the historical context and well Melchizedek shows up.
[00:19:50.880 --> 00:19:56.880]   So when he says Melchizedek is greater than Abraham, that you understand the historical
[00:19:56.880 --> 00:20:03.320]   context, Abraham has been tremendously blessed by God.
[00:20:03.320 --> 00:20:09.380]   He's not even a nation yet and yet he's able to conquer four kingdoms by himself.
[00:20:09.380 --> 00:20:16.360]   And after he regains possession of all that was lost, gives it and is coming back with
[00:20:16.360 --> 00:20:25.280]   his nephew is when he comes and encounters Melchizedek, the king of Salem.
[00:20:25.280 --> 00:20:35.360]   Again, all of this is a background because the point that he's trying to make is Melchizedek
[00:20:35.360 --> 00:20:38.200]   is greater than Abraham.
[00:20:38.200 --> 00:20:40.720]   You know what that makes Abraham?
[00:20:40.720 --> 00:20:43.960]   Greater than all the kings.
[00:20:43.960 --> 00:20:46.880]   Greater than all these men, greater than all the possessions.
[00:20:46.880 --> 00:20:53.280]   So whatever was happening during history at that time, Melchizedek was greater than Abraham.
[00:20:53.280 --> 00:20:58.640]   So imagine if you were a Jew hearing this, knowing the historical context, who is this
[00:20:58.640 --> 00:21:03.600]   Melchizedek that he shows up from nowhere?
[00:21:03.600 --> 00:21:07.880]   He shows up from nowhere and Abraham bows to him.
[00:21:07.880 --> 00:21:11.400]   I mean, think about it humanly speaking.
[00:21:11.400 --> 00:21:15.840]   Abraham has so much possession in chapter 13, he can't even stay in the same place as
[00:21:15.840 --> 00:21:16.840]   Lot, they separate.
[00:21:16.840 --> 00:21:19.400]   Lot gets captured by four other kings.
[00:21:19.400 --> 00:21:24.680]   Remember, these four kings conquered five other kings.
[00:21:24.680 --> 00:21:30.440]   Abraham has become strong enough in chapter 14 to even conquer them.
[00:21:30.440 --> 00:21:38.760]   And then here's this guy, literally one or two verses shows up and Abraham bows to him.
[00:21:38.760 --> 00:21:44.760]   So if you're reading that carefully, if you're reading through Genesis carefully, you should
[00:21:44.760 --> 00:21:48.200]   have stopped and asked.
[00:21:48.200 --> 00:21:50.440]   Who is this guy?
[00:21:50.440 --> 00:21:54.720]   Who is Melchizedek?
[00:21:54.720 --> 00:21:57.000]   But that never gets explained.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:01.880]   Other than way over in Psalm chapter 110, he says, well, the Messiah is going to come
[00:22:01.880 --> 00:22:05.560]   in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:22:05.560 --> 00:22:10.900]   So the only other thing that we know about Melchizedek is that Abraham considered him
[00:22:10.900 --> 00:22:12.280]   greater than himself.
[00:22:12.280 --> 00:22:19.120]   That's all we were taught in Genesis 14, that he is a king priest, received the tithe, disappears.
[00:22:19.120 --> 00:22:22.320]   And then he says, the Messiah is going to come in the order of Melchizedek.
[00:22:22.320 --> 00:22:26.720]   So if you've been studying the Old Testament, preparing and waiting for the Messiah, and
[00:22:26.720 --> 00:22:32.520]   all of a sudden the author of Hebrew says, you want some meat?
[00:22:32.520 --> 00:22:34.140]   Here's some meat.
[00:22:34.140 --> 00:22:37.280]   You want to really understand what God has been doing in history.
[00:22:37.280 --> 00:22:38.960]   Here it comes.
[00:22:38.960 --> 00:22:45.560]   Jesus comes in the order of Melchizedek to fulfill that prophecy in Psalm 110.
[00:22:45.560 --> 00:22:50.060]   But before I get into this meat, you need to pay attention.
[00:22:50.060 --> 00:22:55.120]   If you've been a casual Christian and all you want to know is Jesus loves you and died
[00:22:55.120 --> 00:23:01.280]   for you and that's enough for you, and you're not curious enough to dig into his glory,
[00:23:01.280 --> 00:23:07.160]   and you're not curious enough to ask deep questions, then it's going to go over your
[00:23:07.160 --> 00:23:08.160]   head.
[00:23:08.160 --> 00:23:11.080]   So that was all a setup, right?
[00:23:11.080 --> 00:23:19.520]   Well, all of that, again, to give you the background understanding of how a first century
[00:23:19.520 --> 00:23:27.760]   Jew who knew the history would have heard, Melchizedek is greater than Abraham.
[00:23:27.760 --> 00:23:31.320]   Now we're going to be on this subject for the next two, three weeks.
[00:23:31.320 --> 00:23:35.120]   But for today, I'm going to give you three things that this passage says, what makes
[00:23:35.120 --> 00:23:37.680]   Melchizedek greater than Abraham.
[00:23:37.680 --> 00:23:43.560]   Number one, the one who collects tithes is greater than the one who gives it.
[00:23:43.560 --> 00:23:48.640]   It says in verse four, "Now observe how great this man was to whom Abraham the patriarch
[00:23:48.640 --> 00:23:54.840]   gave a tenth of the choice's spoils."
[00:23:54.840 --> 00:23:59.680]   Observe how great this man, Melchizedek, was to whom Abraham patriarch gave a tenth of
[00:23:59.680 --> 00:24:02.440]   the choice's spoils.
[00:24:02.440 --> 00:24:05.640]   Now let's understand what tithing is.
[00:24:05.640 --> 00:24:12.360]   The specific law of tithing did not come in until the Mosaic law in Leviticus chapter
[00:24:12.360 --> 00:24:13.360]   27.
[00:24:13.360 --> 00:24:19.600]   So those of you who are with us studying Leviticus chapter 27, remember what he says there.
[00:24:19.600 --> 00:24:24.880]   But tithing actually shows up way before that, here in Genesis chapter 14, and probably before
[00:24:24.880 --> 00:24:27.800]   that, because there is no instruction given to Abraham.
[00:24:27.800 --> 00:24:32.840]   Abraham knew to give tithe even before any instructions are written down.
[00:24:32.840 --> 00:24:39.360]   So in other words, the sacrificial system outside of the Mosaic law existed.
[00:24:39.360 --> 00:24:45.360]   He shows up and the meaning behind the tithe, whether it was pre-Mosaic law or post-Mosaic
[00:24:45.360 --> 00:24:51.440]   law, in Leviticus 27.30 says this, "Thus all the tithes of the land, of the seed of the
[00:24:51.440 --> 00:24:58.480]   land, of the fruit of the tree, is the Lord's and it is holy to the Lord."
[00:24:58.480 --> 00:25:05.000]   Tithing was commanded to the nation of Israel as an act of lordship.
[00:25:05.000 --> 00:25:12.520]   Giving a tenth of the best of the harvest was given to God to declare that all of this
[00:25:12.520 --> 00:25:14.760]   ultimately belongs to you.
[00:25:14.760 --> 00:25:15.760]   It was an act of lordship.
[00:25:15.760 --> 00:25:20.520]   It was a first sign that whatever, whether I was a millionaire or whether I'm just making
[00:25:20.520 --> 00:25:25.040]   a few bucks, that in His sovereign will, God gave me what He gave me and I'm returning
[00:25:25.040 --> 00:25:26.040]   it to you.
[00:25:26.040 --> 00:25:28.880]   So what tithing was in the Old Testament?
[00:25:28.880 --> 00:25:37.360]   Well, he says, Melchizedek shows up and Abraham, if he was rich before, now he's filthy rich,
[00:25:37.360 --> 00:25:38.360]   right?
[00:25:38.360 --> 00:25:44.920]   Because he just beat four kings and everything that they took became his.
[00:25:44.920 --> 00:25:49.760]   So you see this progression of God blessing him and he's become this filthy rich man and
[00:25:49.760 --> 00:25:54.320]   he gives a tenth of that as an offering to Melchizedek.
[00:25:54.320 --> 00:25:59.480]   And so he says, "The one who receives the tithes is greater than the one who gives it."
[00:25:59.480 --> 00:26:03.720]   So immediately Abraham recognizes him as greater.
[00:26:03.720 --> 00:26:08.880]   Hebrews 7, 9, it says, "So to speak, though through Abraham, even Levi, who received tithes,
[00:26:08.880 --> 00:26:09.880]   paid tithes."
[00:26:09.880 --> 00:26:14.320]   Again, I hope I didn't lose any of you, okay?
[00:26:14.320 --> 00:26:18.160]   I hope you're putting your thinking cap on and straining to understand.
[00:26:18.160 --> 00:26:21.480]   And if you don't understand, please ask, right?
[00:26:21.480 --> 00:26:25.080]   Don't just kind of, you know, just kind of, "I don't understand.
[00:26:25.080 --> 00:26:26.080]   It must not be important.
[00:26:26.080 --> 00:26:29.040]   If I don't understand, it must not be important."
[00:26:29.040 --> 00:26:33.240]   I think part of the reason why there's shallowness in Christianity is because there's shallowness
[00:26:33.240 --> 00:26:35.740]   in the interest in the things of God.
[00:26:35.740 --> 00:26:40.800]   And so you kind of, it's kind of like seeing, you know, seeing like, you know, beautiful
[00:26:40.800 --> 00:26:44.240]   things like, you know, from a far distance.
[00:26:44.240 --> 00:26:49.920]   Those of you who ever traveled to maybe Seven Wonders, you know, like maybe, I don't know,
[00:26:49.920 --> 00:26:56.400]   like Dam for, you know, like you've gone to Machu Picchu, you know, the Great Wall, those
[00:26:56.400 --> 00:26:58.840]   are the only thing I can think of right now, right?
[00:26:58.840 --> 00:27:01.600]   It's not the same looking at pictures.
[00:27:01.600 --> 00:27:03.600]   It's not the same hearing other people describe it.
[00:27:03.600 --> 00:27:08.240]   It's not the same, right, as when you are able to physically watch it.
[00:27:08.240 --> 00:27:13.120]   Well, I think in the same way, many Christians are satisfied with the explanation that other
[00:27:13.120 --> 00:27:16.000]   Christians give about who Christ is.
[00:27:16.000 --> 00:27:18.320]   And that's enough, right?
[00:27:18.320 --> 00:27:22.440]   And the reason why many people's faith remains shallow is because they're satisfied with
[00:27:22.440 --> 00:27:25.320]   just staying, keeping their distance and not really digging in.
[00:27:25.320 --> 00:27:30.880]   Well, again, this is one of those things that the more we dig, the more of glory of God
[00:27:30.880 --> 00:27:31.880]   it gets revealed.
[00:27:31.880 --> 00:27:34.560]   And hope, my hope is that you will see that.
[00:27:34.560 --> 00:27:40.400]   The more we dig, the more you see just how deep this thing goes, right?
[00:27:40.400 --> 00:27:47.800]   So when he says, just by him giving the tithe, it can show, it shows that Melchizedek is
[00:27:47.800 --> 00:27:51.320]   greater than this guy who just conquered all these kings.
[00:27:51.320 --> 00:27:55.160]   So this was a source of pride for the Jews.
[00:27:55.160 --> 00:28:01.680]   Remember when Jesus says to the Jews, he said, "If you abide in my word, then you shall
[00:28:01.680 --> 00:28:04.800]   know the truth and you will be my disciple and you shall know the truth and truth shall
[00:28:04.800 --> 00:28:05.800]   set you free."
[00:28:05.800 --> 00:28:07.720]   And they get offended.
[00:28:07.720 --> 00:28:09.560]   To set free?
[00:28:09.560 --> 00:28:11.440]   You're not talking to slaves.
[00:28:11.440 --> 00:28:16.600]   You're comparing us to these bond servants, these indentured servants.
[00:28:16.600 --> 00:28:19.680]   You're not low class like that, right?
[00:28:19.680 --> 00:28:20.680]   We've never been slaves.
[00:28:20.680 --> 00:28:21.680]   How dare you call us that?
[00:28:21.680 --> 00:28:26.760]   And then it says in John 8, 33, they answered him, "We are Abraham's descendants and have
[00:28:26.760 --> 00:28:28.840]   never yet been enslaved to anyone.
[00:28:28.840 --> 00:28:34.400]   How is it that you say you will become free?"
[00:28:34.400 --> 00:28:37.440]   What is our confidence?
[00:28:37.440 --> 00:28:40.040]   What is your confidence?
[00:28:40.040 --> 00:28:47.080]   You know, at the beginning of all this pandemic, right, and fear gripped the world.
[00:28:47.080 --> 00:28:52.040]   We were seeing scenes of people dying on the street and we were hearing crazy numbers of
[00:28:52.040 --> 00:28:55.440]   over 2 million people are going to get infected or even die.
[00:28:55.440 --> 00:28:59.500]   And so we thought at the beginning of all of this, that every single one of us is going
[00:28:59.500 --> 00:29:02.800]   to know somebody personally, that there's some people in our church who's going to get
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:04.300]   in and they're going to die.
[00:29:04.300 --> 00:29:07.560]   And so fear gripped not only us, but the rest of the world.
[00:29:07.560 --> 00:29:12.280]   And that's why they did something really radical, shutting down the economy for this long, even
[00:29:12.280 --> 00:29:14.880]   with all the consequences.
[00:29:14.880 --> 00:29:20.480]   Now that the information is coming out, and it is still serious, but it wasn't anywhere
[00:29:20.480 --> 00:29:24.440]   close to what they were fearing in the beginning.
[00:29:24.440 --> 00:29:29.080]   And so slowly the economy is coming back and slowly people are coming back to work and
[00:29:29.080 --> 00:29:30.520]   churches are starting to open up.
[00:29:30.520 --> 00:29:36.120]   And I know that there's still a lot of fear, but at what point?
[00:29:36.120 --> 00:29:39.840]   How safe does it have to be for people to gather?
[00:29:39.840 --> 00:29:41.080]   How safe does it have to be?
[00:29:41.080 --> 00:29:45.440]   Is it a 100% guarantee that no one is going to get sick?
[00:29:45.440 --> 00:29:50.360]   100% that you're going to live a long life, you and your children, and die at a ripe old
[00:29:50.360 --> 00:29:52.720]   age.
[00:29:52.720 --> 00:29:56.280]   Where do we find our safety?
[00:29:56.280 --> 00:29:58.920]   Where are we anchored?
[00:29:58.920 --> 00:30:06.080]   There are some things that we do as Christians that a lot of non-Christians wouldn't do because
[00:30:06.080 --> 00:30:09.640]   they do not have hope in Christ.
[00:30:09.640 --> 00:30:19.600]   Living a long, safe, healthy life is the promise that the world gives, not Christ.
[00:30:19.600 --> 00:30:23.960]   Because we believe in Christ, because we are anchored in Christ, our decision-making is
[00:30:23.960 --> 00:30:30.040]   not purely made on safety.
[00:30:30.040 --> 00:30:37.800]   Our satisfaction, our hope, our foundation, our security is grounded in Christ, in Christ
[00:30:37.800 --> 00:30:38.800]   alone.
[00:30:38.800 --> 00:30:43.400]   See, these Jews thought that they were safe because they were descendants of Abraham.
[00:30:43.400 --> 00:30:44.400]   We're not like these Gentiles.
[00:30:44.400 --> 00:30:45.400]   We're not like these pagans.
[00:30:45.400 --> 00:30:48.920]   We said, "No, there's something greater than Abraham."
[00:30:48.920 --> 00:30:54.080]   Well, if there's somebody greater than Abraham, where does that put us?
[00:30:54.080 --> 00:30:57.680]   There's something outside of Israel greater than us, then where does it put us?
[00:30:57.680 --> 00:31:02.080]   And all of a sudden, it completely abolishes their security.
[00:31:02.080 --> 00:31:05.080]   And that's exactly what it was meant to do.
[00:31:05.080 --> 00:31:10.160]   Whatever it is that you are anchored in, you're not safe.
[00:31:10.160 --> 00:31:12.960]   And that's why I said, "You're drifting back thinking that you're going to be safer if
[00:31:12.960 --> 00:31:14.400]   you go back to your old system."
[00:31:14.400 --> 00:31:21.120]   He says, "No, Christ brings in something greater than that."
[00:31:21.120 --> 00:31:24.560]   So just by the tithe alone, you can see that Melchizedek is greater.
[00:31:24.560 --> 00:31:32.160]   But secondly, the one who blesses is greater than the one who is being blessed.
[00:31:32.160 --> 00:31:37.440]   Verse 7, "But without any dispute, the lesser is blessed by the greater."
[00:31:37.440 --> 00:31:41.960]   But without any dispute, you know what that means?
[00:31:41.960 --> 00:31:47.760]   Abraham met Melchizedek, and it seems like, at least according to Scripture, that he's
[00:31:47.760 --> 00:31:52.080]   never met him before, but immediately he recognizes somebody greater than him.
[00:31:52.080 --> 00:31:58.240]   Just so that we understand the context, if there was any period of time Abraham would
[00:31:58.240 --> 00:32:03.360]   have been an arrogant person, I think it would have been then, right?
[00:32:03.360 --> 00:32:07.360]   Because he just conquered four kings.
[00:32:07.360 --> 00:32:10.160]   Who conquered other five kings?
[00:32:10.160 --> 00:32:13.760]   He's got so much possession, he had to separate even before this happened.
[00:32:13.760 --> 00:32:19.580]   So imagine how much wealth that Abraham has at chapter 14.
[00:32:19.580 --> 00:32:22.520]   Imagine how much power he has.
[00:32:22.520 --> 00:32:29.000]   But all of a sudden he sees this strange guy coming, Melchizedek, and he immediately submits
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:31.320]   himself under him.
[00:32:31.320 --> 00:32:33.920]   He says, "It was without dispute."
[00:32:33.920 --> 00:32:40.720]   You know, like a lot of people play basketball, and maybe you're really good, and you're king
[00:32:40.720 --> 00:32:45.560]   of the court, and if you play, you know, you get to play in four, five, six games straight
[00:32:45.560 --> 00:32:49.920]   because you're the best guy on the court, and all of a sudden Michael Jordan shows up,
[00:32:49.920 --> 00:32:57.740]   or Kobe, or LeBron, whoever you're a fan of, or Steph Curry, okay, I'm going to cover everybody.
[00:32:57.740 --> 00:32:59.020]   You can't open your mouth.
[00:32:59.020 --> 00:33:01.280]   There is no dispute.
[00:33:01.280 --> 00:33:07.280]   Maybe in street ball and maybe at LA Fitness there's some competition, and maybe you might
[00:33:07.280 --> 00:33:11.180]   be a little bit better than them, but all of a sudden if one of those guys shows up,
[00:33:11.180 --> 00:33:15.920]   there is no disputing because no one would take you seriously.
[00:33:15.920 --> 00:33:19.040]   Even if you mentioned that, they would laugh at you.
[00:33:19.040 --> 00:33:25.400]   He says that Melchizedek's superiority was so obvious.
[00:33:25.400 --> 00:33:26.700]   Now we don't know what he saw.
[00:33:26.700 --> 00:33:28.980]   We don't know if there was some glory upon him.
[00:33:28.980 --> 00:33:29.980]   We don't know.
[00:33:29.980 --> 00:33:37.120]   But as soon as he saw Melchizedek, he recognized God's presence upon him and his authority,
[00:33:37.120 --> 00:33:43.320]   and he said without dispute, there was no jockeying, there was no questioning, there
[00:33:43.320 --> 00:33:46.960]   was no who are you, why should I give you, there's none of that.
[00:33:46.960 --> 00:33:55.240]   As soon as he saw the Lord's anointing upon him, he, without dispute, he gives him the
[00:33:55.240 --> 00:33:58.120]   tithe and he receives a blessing.
[00:33:58.120 --> 00:34:06.640]   Now this blessing for Abraham's family is huge, right, because remember Abraham already
[00:34:06.640 --> 00:34:08.480]   had God's blessing upon him.
[00:34:08.480 --> 00:34:12.560]   Remember Genesis chapter 12, we said I will bless you and through you I will bless all
[00:34:12.560 --> 00:34:17.160]   the other nations and because of God's blessing, they're getting filthy rich and then they're
[00:34:17.160 --> 00:34:27.480]   able to conquer other nations and yet he saw the blessing of Melchizedek greater than him
[00:34:27.480 --> 00:34:32.680]   without dispute.
[00:34:32.680 --> 00:34:39.000]   That should really cause us to take a step back and say there's something upon this guy,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:41.400]   it was not like any other kings.
[00:34:41.400 --> 00:34:44.120]   It wasn't like he just happened to be a great king.
[00:34:44.120 --> 00:34:47.660]   There was some anointing upon him that he recognized.
[00:34:47.660 --> 00:34:54.040]   And this blessing upon Israel, again, comes back again, remember the story of Jacob and
[00:34:54.040 --> 00:34:55.040]   Esau?
[00:34:55.040 --> 00:35:01.040]   Esau, Jacob is the slippery one, Esau is the hairy one.
[00:35:01.040 --> 00:35:05.840]   Whenever I read that story, I think like humanly speaking, I naturally gravitate toward Esau
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:08.200]   because he's a manly guy.
[00:35:08.200 --> 00:35:13.800]   He's the guy who's hunting, you know, and Jacob's the guy who's a mama's boy.
[00:35:13.800 --> 00:35:18.240]   He's home, you know, playing something with his mom.
[00:35:18.240 --> 00:35:25.160]   And so Jacob is staying home and he's maneuvering to take his older brother's blessing away.
[00:35:25.160 --> 00:35:31.560]   Esau comes back famished and he said, "Well, if you give me your birthright, your blessing
[00:35:31.560 --> 00:35:34.680]   as a firstborn, I'll give you this bowl of soup."
[00:35:34.680 --> 00:35:37.080]   Now Esau, you know, he's hungry.
[00:35:37.080 --> 00:35:40.840]   So what does this blessing mean to me when I'm going to die?
[00:35:40.840 --> 00:35:44.800]   And it's just kind of drama, he's over-exaggerating.
[00:35:44.800 --> 00:35:52.400]   Well that little event, that little twist that Jacob carries out causes the blessing
[00:35:52.400 --> 00:35:55.680]   to go through Jacob instead of Esau.
[00:35:55.680 --> 00:36:04.640]   Later on in Hebrews 12, verse 16, he warns us not to be like Esau who sold his blessing
[00:36:04.640 --> 00:36:07.600]   and became immoral.
[00:36:07.600 --> 00:36:11.920]   Immoral and ungodly because of that.
[00:36:11.920 --> 00:36:18.800]   When we look at that, it's like, wow, he lost his blessing from God because he got hungry
[00:36:18.800 --> 00:36:22.440]   and he couldn't say no to this thing.
[00:36:22.440 --> 00:36:29.120]   Now you have to understand that this blessing, this firstborn blessing upon Esau was not
[00:36:29.120 --> 00:36:31.100]   an ordinary blessing of any other family.
[00:36:31.100 --> 00:36:33.180]   This was an anointed family.
[00:36:33.180 --> 00:36:39.420]   When he rejected the blessing, he wasn't just rejecting the inheritance of his forefathers.
[00:36:39.420 --> 00:36:45.120]   He was rejecting God's blessing, God's promise that he made upon this family.
[00:36:45.120 --> 00:36:49.920]   And so when he rejected, he was literally saying, you know, what good is God to me?
[00:36:49.920 --> 00:36:56.280]   What good is all the promises that God made to me, to my fathers and my grandfather, if
[00:36:56.280 --> 00:36:58.660]   I can't eat?
[00:36:58.660 --> 00:37:06.440]   And that's why he was called immoral and godless because he rejected God for a bowl of soup.
[00:37:06.440 --> 00:37:07.440]   What is my point?
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:17.200]   My point is to receive Abraham, who had this anointing from God, to meet Melchizedek and
[00:37:17.200 --> 00:37:22.440]   to say, your blessing, I need you, your blessing.
[00:37:22.440 --> 00:37:26.480]   It says a lot about what Abraham recognized.
[00:37:26.480 --> 00:37:32.120]   The one who was being blessed is less than the one who is blessing.
[00:37:32.120 --> 00:37:42.200]   You know what this tells us is, our greatest hindrance in our walk with God is pride.
[00:37:42.200 --> 00:37:45.400]   It's our pride.
[00:37:45.400 --> 00:37:52.600]   When we are not able to recognize, we're not able to recognize who God is, and we refuse
[00:37:52.600 --> 00:37:56.100]   to submit ourselves to him.
[00:37:56.100 --> 00:38:00.560]   That is our greatest hindrance to true worship and is the greatest hindrance to ultimately
[00:38:00.560 --> 00:38:02.560]   our life.
[00:38:02.560 --> 00:38:08.000]   But when we're in the presence of God, there is no disputing.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:13.920]   When you go to heaven, you know, like even on earth, even in the church, there's always,
[00:38:13.920 --> 00:38:17.560]   there's always discussions about whose opinion is right, whose is wrong.
[00:38:17.560 --> 00:38:21.160]   Right now you have the whole country, whole world divided as to who's right and who's
[00:38:21.160 --> 00:38:22.680]   wrong.
[00:38:22.680 --> 00:38:26.640]   I don't think we're going to know for years, to be honest, like which information is right,
[00:38:26.640 --> 00:38:27.760]   which is wrong.
[00:38:27.760 --> 00:38:33.360]   And everybody is absolutely convinced my party is right, my information is right, my facts,
[00:38:33.360 --> 00:38:36.000]   the doctors that I rely on, we're all right.
[00:38:36.000 --> 00:38:40.360]   And I don't think we're really going to know until years have passed and everything that
[00:38:40.360 --> 00:38:41.360]   we know.
[00:38:41.360 --> 00:38:46.040]   And when we are separated from our emotions, our own opinions, and we just purely look
[00:38:46.040 --> 00:38:49.520]   at the facts, what's going on today?
[00:38:49.520 --> 00:38:51.320]   That happens oftentimes even in the church.
[00:38:51.320 --> 00:38:52.600]   Who's right, who's wrong?
[00:38:52.600 --> 00:38:56.640]   My education, my experience, right?
[00:38:56.640 --> 00:39:00.240]   My understanding, my giftedness over your giftedness.
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:01.680]   And some, no, mine better.
[00:39:01.680 --> 00:39:04.620]   No, you're better.
[00:39:04.620 --> 00:39:10.000]   But when you look at the scene in heaven, there is no disputing.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:17.000]   If you've ever seen the picture of what heaven looks like, angels, elders, holy creatures,
[00:39:17.000 --> 00:39:26.280]   the multitudes, Jews and the Gentiles are all bowed down at the throne of grace in eternal
[00:39:26.280 --> 00:39:28.760]   worship.
[00:39:28.760 --> 00:39:31.400]   There is no disputing.
[00:39:31.400 --> 00:39:35.800]   When we're in the presence of God, it automatically causes us to be humble.
[00:39:35.800 --> 00:39:40.920]   I would think Abraham would have been a very difficult person to bring to his knees at
[00:39:40.920 --> 00:39:41.920]   that point.
[00:39:41.920 --> 00:39:48.920]   And yet as soon as he recognized God's anointing upon Melchizedek, he became humble.
[00:39:48.920 --> 00:39:51.100]   He became humble.
[00:39:51.100 --> 00:39:57.000]   Even though it was just a blip in history, it was a shadow that if you've been paying
[00:39:57.000 --> 00:39:59.880]   attention, who is this guy?
[00:39:59.880 --> 00:40:02.760]   Why would Abraham submit himself to him?
[00:40:02.760 --> 00:40:07.180]   Why would Abraham with God's blessing receive blessing from him?
[00:40:07.180 --> 00:40:13.100]   So that when Christ came and he said, "Jesus comes in the order of Melchizedek," that's
[00:40:13.100 --> 00:40:15.060]   who he was.
[00:40:15.060 --> 00:40:18.740]   Now it makes sense why Abraham submitted himself to him.
[00:40:18.740 --> 00:40:21.240]   Now it makes sense why he gave tithe to him.
[00:40:21.240 --> 00:40:27.060]   Now it makes sense why Melchizedek did not dispute.
[00:40:27.060 --> 00:40:36.280]   Third, and finally, the one who serves perpetually is greater than the one who serves temporarily.
[00:40:36.280 --> 00:40:39.000]   All the other priesthood that the Jews knew was temporary.
[00:40:39.000 --> 00:40:44.800]   In fact, they had a time limit as to how long they can serve.
[00:40:44.800 --> 00:40:50.680]   In Hebrews 7.3, it says, "Melchizedek is without father, without mother, without genealogy,
[00:40:50.680 --> 00:40:54.560]   having neither beginning of days nor end of life."
[00:40:54.560 --> 00:41:01.160]   Some people have read this and thought, "This sounds like Jesus."
[00:41:01.160 --> 00:41:04.040]   And so there's been a lot of discussion as to, "Is this Jesus?
[00:41:04.040 --> 00:41:05.800]   Is this not Jesus?"
[00:41:05.800 --> 00:41:09.960]   Because so many of the descriptions that he gives about Melchizedek sounds like Jesus.
[00:41:09.960 --> 00:41:14.960]   Well, clearly he is not Jesus, and I'm going to explain that a little bit later.
[00:41:14.960 --> 00:41:22.320]   What he is saying is that Melchizedek doesn't come from the same line of the Levites.
[00:41:22.320 --> 00:41:27.680]   And when he says he's without genealogy, it means that his authority does not come from
[00:41:27.680 --> 00:41:30.240]   his birth.
[00:41:30.240 --> 00:41:32.960]   Now why does he say it this way?
[00:41:32.960 --> 00:41:39.320]   Because if you remember the Old Testament, the Old Testament is filled with genealogies,
[00:41:39.320 --> 00:41:40.520]   right?
[00:41:40.520 --> 00:41:41.680]   It's filled with genealogies.
[00:41:41.680 --> 00:41:44.200]   And sometimes we read these genealogies, "What is the purpose of these genealogies?
[00:41:44.200 --> 00:41:46.160]   I don't understand who these people are.
[00:41:46.160 --> 00:41:51.620]   Why are there so many pages and chapters that talk about genealogy?
[00:41:51.620 --> 00:41:55.320]   Maybe if I was closer, maybe if that was my grandfather, that would make more sense."
[00:41:55.320 --> 00:42:01.400]   The reason why there's genealogy is because genealogy traces the authenticity of that
[00:42:01.400 --> 00:42:02.660]   person's position.
[00:42:02.660 --> 00:42:08.520]   So he was constantly tracing the genealogy of how this Savior was going to come.
[00:42:08.520 --> 00:42:14.760]   But they also traced the genealogy of the Levites, because only a Levite can participate
[00:42:14.760 --> 00:42:16.720]   in the temple work.
[00:42:16.720 --> 00:42:21.800]   So when he says he is without father, without mother, without genealogy, means he is outside
[00:42:21.800 --> 00:42:24.040]   of that system.
[00:42:24.040 --> 00:42:29.320]   That his authority doesn't come because his parents were Levites, or because his grandfather
[00:42:29.320 --> 00:42:30.320]   was blessed.
[00:42:30.320 --> 00:42:33.440]   He is, in other words, above that.
[00:42:33.440 --> 00:42:40.040]   There is a separate system, separate priestly system that is not submitted to human system.
[00:42:40.040 --> 00:42:41.040]   Okay?
[00:42:41.040 --> 00:42:45.680]   So again, hopefully you're following me.
[00:42:45.680 --> 00:42:49.960]   Remember when the disciples asked Jesus to pray, right?
[00:42:49.960 --> 00:42:50.960]   This is what Jesus had to pray.
[00:42:50.960 --> 00:42:54.880]   He said, "Our Father which art in heaven, hallowed be thy name.
[00:42:54.880 --> 00:42:56.320]   Thy kingdom come.
[00:42:56.320 --> 00:43:02.720]   Thy will be done on earth as it is in heaven."
[00:43:02.720 --> 00:43:06.000]   That's the beginning of the Lord's Prayer, right?
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:11.640]   That his will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:43:11.640 --> 00:43:18.240]   Meaning, whatever God is doing, whatever system that God has, whatever order that exists in
[00:43:18.240 --> 00:43:22.840]   heaven will eventually be reflected on earth.
[00:43:22.840 --> 00:43:24.200]   You follow that?
[00:43:24.200 --> 00:43:31.760]   The problem that we get into is we want the earthly things to be reflected in heaven.
[00:43:31.760 --> 00:43:39.120]   And a lot of times the way we even imagine what heaven will be like is utopia on earth.
[00:43:39.120 --> 00:43:42.720]   Whatever is the most beautiful thing that I can imagine on earth, that maybe that's
[00:43:42.720 --> 00:43:45.440]   what heaven is like.
[00:43:45.440 --> 00:43:51.240]   The prayer and the activity of Christians is to recognize that even the most beautiful
[00:43:51.240 --> 00:43:56.600]   thing that you and I see on earth is under God's curse.
[00:43:56.600 --> 00:44:00.680]   Sin affected not only human beings, but it also affected animals.
[00:44:00.680 --> 00:44:03.320]   It also affected creation.
[00:44:03.320 --> 00:44:08.880]   So everything that you and I see, all the systems that we see, have all been affected
[00:44:08.880 --> 00:44:09.880]   by sin.
[00:44:09.880 --> 00:44:15.060]   And it will all be done away with when Christ comes.
[00:44:15.060 --> 00:44:18.920]   So a Christian's prayer is to have his kingdom come.
[00:44:18.920 --> 00:44:22.320]   Things will be done on earth as it is in heaven.
[00:44:22.320 --> 00:44:29.920]   Well the reason why I say all of this is because Melchizedek's priesthood is a heavenly priesthood.
[00:44:29.920 --> 00:44:35.480]   That wasn't meant for temporary system where Christ came and it's done away with.
[00:44:35.480 --> 00:44:40.800]   That that temporary system ultimately was to prepare for the eternal system that was
[00:44:40.800 --> 00:44:44.000]   coming under Melchizedek.
[00:44:44.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   You get that?
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:46.000]   Okay.
[00:44:46.000 --> 00:44:48.840]   Now I have no idea if you got it or not.
[00:44:48.840 --> 00:44:50.840]   I'll see in the coming weeks.
[00:44:50.840 --> 00:44:55.800]   When I see your face and I mention Melchizedek and you have a blank look, I'll know if you
[00:44:55.800 --> 00:44:58.240]   paid attention or not or if you got it or not.
[00:44:58.240 --> 00:44:59.240]   Okay?
[00:44:59.240 --> 00:45:02.000]   But again, this is that important.
[00:45:02.000 --> 00:45:09.440]   Melchizedek, his priesthood comes from heaven.
[00:45:09.440 --> 00:45:10.480]   It was preparing.
[00:45:10.480 --> 00:45:15.400]   So I didn't mention this in the beginning, but I think it's important that I mention
[00:45:15.400 --> 00:45:17.000]   this.
[00:45:17.000 --> 00:45:25.160]   Why does God use like Melchizedek as a type, as an impression to prepare for the coming
[00:45:25.160 --> 00:45:26.160]   of Christ?
[00:45:26.160 --> 00:45:30.520]   Why doesn't he just say, "Melchizedek is a system made in heaven.
[00:45:30.520 --> 00:45:31.960]   This is who Melchizedek is.
[00:45:31.960 --> 00:45:32.960]   He is not Jesus."
[00:45:32.960 --> 00:45:33.960]   Why does he not explain?
[00:45:33.960 --> 00:45:38.720]   Why does he just give us a picture of him and then we find the reflection of that in
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:41.560]   Christ and then tells us a detail in Christ?
[00:45:41.560 --> 00:45:45.320]   Because first of all, it wasn't about Melchizedek.
[00:45:45.320 --> 00:45:47.800]   Melchizedek was only to prepare.
[00:45:47.800 --> 00:45:49.480]   The meat was in Christ.
[00:45:49.480 --> 00:45:54.120]   It was only to prepare for Christ to come.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:57.800]   Hebrews chapter 1 verse 1, it says, "God spoke in many ways in the Old Testament through
[00:45:57.800 --> 00:46:01.080]   many avenues in order to prepare."
[00:46:01.080 --> 00:46:03.720]   But now they speak, what?
[00:46:03.720 --> 00:46:05.520]   God speaks through his son.
[00:46:05.520 --> 00:46:07.760]   That's how the book of Hebrews starts.
[00:46:07.760 --> 00:46:15.280]   So in other words, everything that you knew about the gospel has been spoken through poetry,
[00:46:15.280 --> 00:46:23.920]   through illustrations, through proverbs, through narratives, and through various kinds of types
[00:46:23.920 --> 00:46:26.280]   and pictures.
[00:46:26.280 --> 00:46:31.760]   But now in the New Testament, the new covenant, God speaks clearly through his son, which
[00:46:31.760 --> 00:46:34.920]   is what we are experiencing now.
[00:46:34.920 --> 00:46:37.720]   Now why is it communicated that way?
[00:46:37.720 --> 00:46:43.000]   Again, let me go back to India.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:47.120]   India has the heaviest concentration, the largest concentration of illiteracy in the
[00:46:47.120 --> 00:46:48.120]   world.
[00:46:48.120 --> 00:46:54.560]   In fact, they say that 39% of every illiterate person in the world is in India.
[00:46:54.560 --> 00:46:58.280]   That's a large number of people who are illiterate.
[00:46:58.280 --> 00:47:02.720]   And majority of these illiterate people are in villages who are poor because they don't
[00:47:02.720 --> 00:47:03.720]   get education.
[00:47:03.720 --> 00:47:09.920]   So you have young children as young as three, four, five, even up to 10, 15, 16, 17-year-olds
[00:47:09.920 --> 00:47:11.120]   who've never gone to school.
[00:47:11.120 --> 00:47:13.000]   And we run into them all the time.
[00:47:13.000 --> 00:47:15.840]   We have several of our pastors who have no education.
[00:47:15.840 --> 00:47:20.080]   And so when we go there and try to teach the Bible and we do expositional teaching, many
[00:47:20.080 --> 00:47:22.200]   of them cannot follow.
[00:47:22.200 --> 00:47:28.120]   So a lot of the mission work that is done in India are telling them how to tell stories
[00:47:28.120 --> 00:47:30.920]   and how to share stories to other people.
[00:47:30.920 --> 00:47:33.800]   So and here's what's interesting.
[00:47:33.800 --> 00:47:38.280]   And this, hopefully this will kind of help you to understand why the Bible is told a
[00:47:38.280 --> 00:47:40.120]   certain way, right?
[00:47:40.120 --> 00:47:46.640]   During the time of Christ, an average Jewish community, what do you think their illiteracy
[00:47:46.640 --> 00:47:50.120]   rate is?
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:58.360]   According to studies, literacy rate in an average Jewish community during the time of
[00:47:58.360 --> 00:48:06.120]   Christ was somewhere between zero to 10%, depending on which village you lived in.
[00:48:06.120 --> 00:48:08.280]   In fact, most scholars believe there was much less than that.
[00:48:08.280 --> 00:48:11.360]   It's anywhere from zero to three to 4%.
[00:48:11.360 --> 00:48:17.880]   That means over 90% of the people that Jesus was speaking to could not read or write.
[00:48:17.880 --> 00:48:23.720]   Over 90% of the people that the Bible was written for them to understand could not read
[00:48:23.720 --> 00:48:24.720]   or write.
[00:48:24.720 --> 00:48:27.880]   So they were completely dependent upon coming to the temple.
[00:48:27.880 --> 00:48:32.000]   And that's why the Bible says over and over again to commit yourself to what?
[00:48:32.000 --> 00:48:36.360]   Like reading of the scripture because they couldn't read it for themselves.
[00:48:36.360 --> 00:48:41.640]   And that's why they were so susceptible to wolves coming in.
[00:48:41.640 --> 00:48:46.600]   Because they were completely dependent on them to tell them what the Word of God says.
[00:48:46.600 --> 00:48:51.840]   And so God communicated these important things through poetry, through many different channels,
[00:48:51.840 --> 00:48:58.040]   through particular types, Melchizedek, so that when Christ came and they saw who he
[00:48:58.040 --> 00:49:02.320]   was, they could say, "I see the connection."
[00:49:02.320 --> 00:49:07.560]   Even though the way we're studying it, we're expositing words and verses and paragraphs
[00:49:07.560 --> 00:49:12.480]   and syntax and grammar, the early church could not study it that way because they didn't
[00:49:12.480 --> 00:49:14.040]   know any of that.
[00:49:14.040 --> 00:49:17.040]   So God left impressions.
[00:49:17.040 --> 00:49:23.720]   God left stories to make it clear that here's a clear connection of who he is.
[00:49:23.720 --> 00:49:27.800]   And he says that Melchizedek was made like the Son of God.
[00:49:27.800 --> 00:49:33.440]   And this is why we believe that this is not Jesus because he said he was made, first of
[00:49:33.440 --> 00:49:35.240]   all, like the Son of God.
[00:49:35.240 --> 00:49:37.240]   The Son of God was not made like Melchizedek.
[00:49:37.240 --> 00:49:39.440]   Melchizedek was made like the Son of God.
[00:49:39.440 --> 00:49:41.960]   In other words, Christ existed before him.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:43.560]   Christ was there before him.
[00:49:43.560 --> 00:49:51.240]   And so Melchizedek took a reflection of him and then now Christ comes to fulfill what
[00:49:51.240 --> 00:49:55.740]   God placed in history through Melchizedek.
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:59.680]   And he remains perpetually, he says.
[00:49:59.680 --> 00:50:03.240]   A Jewish priest could only serve between the age of 25 and 50.
[00:50:03.240 --> 00:50:07.480]   So even if he had a long career, it would only have lasted 25 years, he says.
[00:50:07.480 --> 00:50:10.960]   But Melchizedek is eternal.
[00:50:10.960 --> 00:50:15.880]   And again in Psalm 110.4, the Lord has sworn and will not change his mind, "You are a priest
[00:50:15.880 --> 00:50:20.160]   forever according to the order of Melchizedek."
[00:50:20.160 --> 00:50:23.600]   Remember what I read at the end of chapter 6?
[00:50:23.600 --> 00:50:27.500]   The reason why he talks about Melchizedek is for what purpose?
[00:50:27.500 --> 00:50:34.740]   So that our hope will be firmly grounded in the truth of Christ.
[00:50:34.740 --> 00:50:41.120]   That wherever that we are anchored in that is not Christ is always going to shift.
[00:50:41.120 --> 00:50:45.360]   That Christ, his priesthood is not one time done and over with.
[00:50:45.360 --> 00:50:46.360]   It is perpetual.
[00:50:46.360 --> 00:50:49.680]   In other words, he is constantly interceding for us.
[00:50:49.680 --> 00:50:55.120]   Not only while we live, but even after we die.
[00:50:55.120 --> 00:51:01.780]   Even in eternity, he is a perpetual priest interceding on our behalf.
[00:51:01.780 --> 00:51:08.440]   So our foundation, our hope is not just during this lifetime.
[00:51:08.440 --> 00:51:11.600]   Is not just while we're walking on earth.
[00:51:11.600 --> 00:51:17.920]   At all times, perpetually, eternally, he stands before us and God.
[00:51:17.920 --> 00:51:22.080]   Always interceding on our behalf.
[00:51:22.080 --> 00:51:29.760]   So therefore, because Christ has fulfilled that role, there is no longer any need for
[00:51:29.760 --> 00:51:31.600]   the Levites.
[00:51:31.600 --> 00:51:36.120]   Which is really interesting because as soon as Christ came, remember what happened at
[00:51:36.120 --> 00:51:39.120]   AD 70?
[00:51:39.120 --> 00:51:45.700]   AD 70 is where the prophecy is fulfilled.
[00:51:45.700 --> 00:51:48.640]   Remember where Jesus is coming into Jerusalem and he weeps over them?
[00:51:48.640 --> 00:51:53.200]   Because only if you knew today what would bring you peace, but because you did not recognize
[00:51:53.200 --> 00:51:59.240]   the coming of the king, that judgment is coming upon Jerusalem.
[00:51:59.240 --> 00:52:02.420]   He was prophesying about the judgment coming on AD 70.
[00:52:02.420 --> 00:52:06.240]   The Roman government got sick of the Jews and they came and completely obliterated the
[00:52:06.240 --> 00:52:08.040]   temple.
[00:52:08.040 --> 00:52:12.880]   Every stone was just taken out and there's no remnant of the temple because the Romans
[00:52:12.880 --> 00:52:14.440]   completely obliterated it.
[00:52:14.440 --> 00:52:18.760]   Now the reason why that's significant is one, it fulfilled Jesus' prophecy.
[00:52:18.760 --> 00:52:29.520]   But two, they can never have the Levites because all the genealogies was kept at the temple.
[00:52:29.520 --> 00:52:30.960]   So if somebody comes and says, "You know what?
[00:52:30.960 --> 00:52:35.360]   I come from the line of the Levites, so let's set up the sacrificial system."
[00:52:35.360 --> 00:52:36.360]   They can't.
[00:52:36.360 --> 00:52:38.560]   Because genealogy is gone.
[00:52:38.560 --> 00:52:43.720]   And they can never establish the king of Israel either because he had to come from the line
[00:52:43.720 --> 00:52:44.720]   of Judah.
[00:52:44.720 --> 00:52:46.520]   There is no record of that.
[00:52:46.520 --> 00:52:52.640]   And even if they were able to somehow find it, the temple is utterly destroyed.
[00:52:52.640 --> 00:52:56.040]   They can't.
[00:52:56.040 --> 00:52:58.920]   Why is it significant?
[00:52:58.920 --> 00:53:02.540]   Because Jesus fulfilled all of that.
[00:53:02.540 --> 00:53:04.360]   And they were no longer in need of it.
[00:53:04.360 --> 00:53:08.040]   Just like John the Baptist came on the scene to prepare the coming of Christ and as soon
[00:53:08.040 --> 00:53:11.080]   as his work was done, he was gone.
[00:53:11.080 --> 00:53:13.120]   He went to be with the Lord.
[00:53:13.120 --> 00:53:16.680]   All the sacrificial system, the Levites, right?
[00:53:16.680 --> 00:53:18.200]   All of it.
[00:53:18.200 --> 00:53:21.380]   Jesus completely fulfills it.
[00:53:21.380 --> 00:53:26.880]   And now he stands before us in the heavenly sanctuary in a new covenant with a greater
[00:53:26.880 --> 00:53:35.960]   priesthood, with a greater sacrifice, interceding on our behalf for eternity.
[00:53:35.960 --> 00:53:41.600]   Can you imagine this was half of the sermon that I prepared for today?
[00:53:41.600 --> 00:53:47.680]   Until yesterday, until yesterday I had actually three times longer than this and I said, "There
[00:53:47.680 --> 00:53:50.800]   is no way I'm going to be able to go through all of this in one day."
[00:53:50.800 --> 00:53:56.120]   And even now as I'm wrapping up, it's like, "I could have cut this in half."
[00:53:56.120 --> 00:53:58.440]   There's so much in here.
[00:53:58.440 --> 00:54:03.320]   And I really want to encourage you.
[00:54:03.320 --> 00:54:07.520]   First of all, if you're not in the Word, if you're not in the Word, it doesn't matter
[00:54:07.520 --> 00:54:13.160]   how much counsel you get and, "Oh, you know, church people are so encouraging to me.
[00:54:13.160 --> 00:54:17.140]   You know, I really love our pastors and I really love our community."
[00:54:17.140 --> 00:54:18.140]   It won't last.
[00:54:18.140 --> 00:54:19.680]   I guarantee you it won't last.
[00:54:19.680 --> 00:54:25.280]   If you yourself are not in the Word regularly and your anchoring is not Christ, it's on
[00:54:25.280 --> 00:54:30.840]   people and system and so I strongly want to encourage you if you're not in the Word to
[00:54:30.840 --> 00:54:32.980]   get into the Word.
[00:54:32.980 --> 00:54:40.140]   But those of you who are in the Word, and you're used to just kind of getting elementary
[00:54:40.140 --> 00:54:45.480]   understanding of the Word of God and when it comes difficult, Leviticus, you know, like
[00:54:45.480 --> 00:54:50.440]   Revelation, Ezekiel, minor prophets, some of the things that are a little bit more difficult
[00:54:50.440 --> 00:54:53.380]   to understand, right, we kind of shy away from.
[00:54:53.380 --> 00:54:55.020]   It's like, "Oh, that's for the pastors.
[00:54:55.020 --> 00:54:57.380]   That's for the people in the seminary."
[00:54:57.380 --> 00:55:00.300]   I really want to encourage you.
[00:55:00.300 --> 00:55:05.220]   The gold, the gold is buried.
[00:55:05.220 --> 00:55:09.340]   It's not deeply buried, but it's buried.
[00:55:09.340 --> 00:55:13.640]   God wants us to seek Him with all our heart.
[00:55:13.640 --> 00:55:15.460]   He wants us to seek Him.
[00:55:15.460 --> 00:55:21.380]   And those whose hearts get enlightened, whose eyes become open, are the people who recognizes
[00:55:21.380 --> 00:55:25.800]   the treasure that is in Christ and so He goes out and sells everything so that makes sure
[00:55:25.800 --> 00:55:31.240]   He has it and in comparison to what He has, all of the other things become rubbish.
[00:55:31.240 --> 00:55:32.740]   Who does that happen to?
[00:55:32.740 --> 00:55:40.820]   For those who are continually pressing on, pushing forward to take hold of that which
[00:55:40.820 --> 00:55:44.420]   was He was taking hold of.
[00:55:44.420 --> 00:55:51.260]   Melchizedek is one of those treasures that I believe that if you strain to really deeply
[00:55:51.260 --> 00:56:01.260]   understand that even this blip in history, even this thing that you may have never properly
[00:56:01.260 --> 00:56:08.020]   understood like God was doing that behind the scene?
[00:56:08.020 --> 00:56:12.820]   God had all of that covered even in this, even in this little tiny glimpse that He showed
[00:56:12.820 --> 00:56:18.580]   me that all this, all these roots are connected to that?
[00:56:18.580 --> 00:56:23.460]   And you'll see the more you dig into the scripture, you know maybe you've been looking at the
[00:56:23.460 --> 00:56:27.760]   trees and you're looking at the fruits, but you don't understand the depth of these roots
[00:56:27.760 --> 00:56:33.940]   because the real fruit is really underground.
[00:56:33.940 --> 00:56:38.340]   And that's when you really see, man, this is the Holy Spirit.
[00:56:38.340 --> 00:56:39.480]   This is God.
[00:56:39.480 --> 00:56:42.180]   No man could have done this.
[00:56:42.180 --> 00:56:46.300]   And again, that's how it affects me when I study Melchizedek.
[00:56:46.300 --> 00:56:50.820]   It reminds me that even the things that I have no understanding, that eventually when
[00:56:50.820 --> 00:56:56.380]   I do dig it up, when I do understand it, wow.
[00:56:56.380 --> 00:57:00.620]   So I hope that that's where you are or hopefully that's where you will be.
[00:57:00.620 --> 00:57:05.700]   So as we continue to study through the book of Hebrews, that it will impact you deeply
[00:57:05.700 --> 00:57:10.980]   and that you would fall in love with the redemptive history and the Word of God afresh as we continue
[00:57:10.980 --> 00:57:11.980]   to study together.
[00:57:11.980 --> 00:57:12.300]   Let's pray.
