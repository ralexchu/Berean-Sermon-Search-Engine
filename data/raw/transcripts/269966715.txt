[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   If you can turn your Bibles with me to Matthew 16, 21-36.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000]   Matthew 16, 21-36.
[00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000]   We're going to take a break from the book of Romans for this week.
[00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:19.000]   We want to take some time to highlight what's going on in this text.
[00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000]   In Matthew 20, 16, 21-26.
[00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:24.000]   Reading out of the ESV.
[00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:49.000]   [Reading in Hebrew]
[00:00:49.000 --> 00:01:07.000]   [Reading in Hebrew]
[00:01:07.000 --> 00:01:14.000]   Let's pray.
[00:01:14.000 --> 00:01:18.000]   Heavenly Father, we thank you and praise you for your goodness.
[00:01:18.000 --> 00:01:22.000]   We ask you especially, Lord God, as we celebrate Mother's Day,
[00:01:22.000 --> 00:01:25.000]   that you would help us, Lord God, to remember your goodness through them.
[00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:27.000]   We ask for your continued grace.
[00:01:27.000 --> 00:01:30.000]   We ask for your word to come and speak to us.
[00:01:30.000 --> 00:01:33.000]   Help us, Lord God, to fix our mind and our heart where it belongs,
[00:01:33.000 --> 00:01:35.000]   to you and to you alone.
[00:01:35.000 --> 00:01:38.000]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:01:38.000 --> 00:01:39.000]   Can you do me a favor?
[00:01:39.000 --> 00:01:40.000]   You guys handing the light?
[00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:41.000]   Turn this light on.
[00:01:41.000 --> 00:01:43.000]   I think this light's forgotten.
[00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:44.000]   Okay, there you go.
[00:01:44.000 --> 00:01:45.000]   All right.
[00:01:45.000 --> 00:01:46.000]   All right.
[00:01:46.000 --> 00:01:49.000]   As I said, I'm going to be taking a break from the Book of Romans.
[00:01:49.000 --> 00:01:54.000]   My intention this morning is not to talk about and worship our mothers.
[00:01:54.000 --> 00:01:58.000]   It is Mother's Day, but it is a service that we're here to honor and glorify God.
[00:01:58.000 --> 00:02:02.000]   So we want the word of God to be spoken and Christ to be highlighted.
[00:02:02.000 --> 00:02:07.000]   But at the same time, we want to address certain issues.
[00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:12.000]   And I think motherhood especially is one of those things that I think is
[00:02:12.000 --> 00:02:17.000]   extremely important for us to take time to consider the grace that God has given us
[00:02:17.000 --> 00:02:23.000]   through the various people that God has given us, but in particular with mothers,
[00:02:23.000 --> 00:02:26.000]   as we celebrate Mother's Day.
[00:02:26.000 --> 00:02:33.000]   I was thankful that early on when we started having our kids, our first kid,
[00:02:33.000 --> 00:02:39.000]   we weren't in a financial situation where Esther could stay home.
[00:02:39.000 --> 00:02:43.000]   And obviously I wasn't making enough money, and so at least for the time being,
[00:02:43.000 --> 00:02:46.000]   we made a decision that I would stay home with Jeremy.
[00:02:46.000 --> 00:02:48.000]   And I forget how long it was.
[00:02:48.000 --> 00:02:51.000]   I don't think it was more than a year, but it felt like a couple decades.
[00:02:51.000 --> 00:02:54.000]   At least that's how it felt.
[00:02:54.000 --> 00:03:00.000]   And it was a -- I think I'm very thankful for that period because it gave me a glimpse
[00:03:00.000 --> 00:03:04.000]   of what it's like to be home as a mother because on the surface it looks like,
[00:03:04.000 --> 00:03:08.000]   well, you're taking care of the kids and you don't have to go and work hard,
[00:03:08.000 --> 00:03:10.000]   or at least on the surface some people may think like that.
[00:03:10.000 --> 00:03:16.000]   But I would honestly say that the whole time I was there with taking care of the baby
[00:03:16.000 --> 00:03:24.000]   or a baby/toddler at that time that I was daydreaming about getting a regular job.
[00:03:24.000 --> 00:03:28.000]   Because at a regular job, if you're tired, you just don't work as hard.
[00:03:28.000 --> 00:03:30.000]   You know what I mean?
[00:03:30.000 --> 00:03:33.000]   You go to your desk and then you just kind of take your time.
[00:03:33.000 --> 00:03:37.000]   You take a bathroom break, 15, 20 minutes.
[00:03:37.000 --> 00:03:39.000]   So you have some time.
[00:03:39.000 --> 00:03:41.000]   You can kind of spread yourself out.
[00:03:41.000 --> 00:03:45.000]   But when you have a child at home, there's no such thing as a break.
[00:03:45.000 --> 00:03:48.000]   The only break you get is when they're sleeping, and if they're not sleeping,
[00:03:48.000 --> 00:03:49.000]   there's no break.
[00:03:49.000 --> 00:03:51.000]   You can't even go to the bathroom.
[00:03:51.000 --> 00:03:53.000]   You have to take them with you.
[00:03:53.000 --> 00:03:54.000]   So there is no break.
[00:03:54.000 --> 00:03:57.000]   And I remember that during that period it was just so exhausting.
[00:03:57.000 --> 00:04:03.000]   And I took plenty of naps when I shouldn't have while he wasn't taking a nap.
[00:04:03.000 --> 00:04:09.000]   I just kind of cornered him in with the sofa so that he couldn't break out.
[00:04:09.000 --> 00:04:13.000]   Because there are some nights when they would just not sleep all day.
[00:04:13.000 --> 00:04:15.000]   They were sick or something.
[00:04:15.000 --> 00:04:17.000]   And then all night you didn't sleep.
[00:04:17.000 --> 00:04:21.000]   And then Esther had to go to work because she had to go to work.
[00:04:21.000 --> 00:04:24.000]   We didn't have any insurance, and she had to pay the bills.
[00:04:24.000 --> 00:04:26.000]   And so I had to do my part.
[00:04:26.000 --> 00:04:29.000]   But I remember so many times just cornering him with the sofa
[00:04:29.000 --> 00:04:32.000]   and then just falling asleep in the sofa
[00:04:32.000 --> 00:04:35.000]   and then waking up looking for him.
[00:04:35.000 --> 00:04:40.000]   And then he would roll to the other side of the room and say, "Oh, that's where he is."
[00:04:40.000 --> 00:04:43.000]   So many times--I've never shared this with Esther.
[00:04:43.000 --> 00:04:46.000]   At least not at that time because I didn't want her to be worried
[00:04:46.000 --> 00:04:49.000]   about what was happening at home.
[00:04:49.000 --> 00:04:54.000]   And I shared with her before, like 3, 3:30, 4 o'clock, about time for her to come home,
[00:04:54.000 --> 00:04:57.000]   I would be literally waiting for the doorknob to turn.
[00:04:57.000 --> 00:05:00.000]   And then as soon as she would come in, I would take him,
[00:05:00.000 --> 00:05:05.000]   and then I would walk into the room and just--I just need to be alone for a little bit.
[00:05:05.000 --> 00:05:10.000]   I'm thankful for that because it gave me a glimpse of how hard it is to take care of a child
[00:05:10.000 --> 00:05:13.000]   because you are attached to them 24/7.
[00:05:13.000 --> 00:05:15.000]   There is no break.
[00:05:15.000 --> 00:05:19.000]   Even when you're not with them, you're with them mentally
[00:05:19.000 --> 00:05:21.000]   because you're worried about them.
[00:05:21.000 --> 00:05:24.000]   Even when you get babysitting and you go out to enjoy yourself, supposedly,
[00:05:24.000 --> 00:05:27.000]   but the whole time all you're thinking about is the kids.
[00:05:27.000 --> 00:05:29.000]   So there's no real break.
[00:05:29.000 --> 00:05:33.000]   I hear a lot of people saying things like, "We're not ready to become a mother or a father."
[00:05:33.000 --> 00:05:35.000]   You're never ready.
[00:05:35.000 --> 00:05:40.000]   How are you ever going to prepare to literally give your life to somebody else?
[00:05:40.000 --> 00:05:44.000]   So God gives you the grace that you need at the moment.
[00:05:44.000 --> 00:05:48.000]   And so moment by moment, you feel like you can't handle it,
[00:05:48.000 --> 00:05:50.000]   but God gives you the grace to be able to do that,
[00:05:50.000 --> 00:05:53.000]   and then eventually God uses that to raise up children.
[00:05:53.000 --> 00:05:58.000]   And so I'm very thankful that I was able to experience that even for a short period of time
[00:05:58.000 --> 00:06:01.000]   because obviously half of our congregation are females,
[00:06:01.000 --> 00:06:05.000]   and to be able to better understand just how difficult it is to raise children.
[00:06:05.000 --> 00:06:08.000]   And one of these days that you, some of you guys, you know,
[00:06:08.000 --> 00:06:10.000]   like you're going to have kids of your own,
[00:06:10.000 --> 00:06:14.000]   and I don't think you really appreciate your mothers until you've been a mother yourself,
[00:06:14.000 --> 00:06:19.000]   at least for a period, and then you're like, "Oh, somebody did that for me."
[00:06:19.000 --> 00:06:23.000]   And among all the common graces that every human being experiences,
[00:06:23.000 --> 00:06:26.000]   I think one of the greatest, if not the greatest common grace,
[00:06:26.000 --> 00:06:29.000]   is the mothers that God places in our lives.
[00:06:29.000 --> 00:06:33.000]   And so I think it's important for us, again, not simply to celebrate motherhood,
[00:06:33.000 --> 00:06:36.000]   but to be able to recognize the people who poured into our lives
[00:06:36.000 --> 00:06:39.000]   because if we are not able to recognize them,
[00:06:39.000 --> 00:06:42.000]   how do we recognize the Heavenly Father up in heaven that we cannot see
[00:06:42.000 --> 00:06:46.000]   if we did not honor those who we can see?
[00:06:46.000 --> 00:06:50.000]   Now again, as I told you, the purpose of this morning is not to highlight and say,
[00:06:50.000 --> 00:06:53.000]   "Here's Mom, let's worship her today."
[00:06:53.000 --> 00:06:59.000]   But in the context of that, I want to talk about how if we're not careful,
[00:06:59.000 --> 00:07:01.000]   if there's anything that we want to get right,
[00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:04.000]   we want to get right in raising our children.
[00:07:04.000 --> 00:07:08.000]   And oftentimes we do things and we don't do it right,
[00:07:08.000 --> 00:07:11.000]   and we'll say to ourselves, "You know, we made an attempt."
[00:07:11.000 --> 00:07:14.000]   The worst thing that you can do in life is not to do something,
[00:07:14.000 --> 00:07:20.000]   but even when we fail, we gain because we learn, and we grow, and we're sanctified.
[00:07:20.000 --> 00:07:22.000]   You can apply that to almost everything in life,
[00:07:22.000 --> 00:07:25.000]   but when it comes to your children, you don't apply that.
[00:07:25.000 --> 00:07:27.000]   You don't say, "Well, you know, I failed when he was one,
[00:07:27.000 --> 00:07:30.000]   but thank God we have when he's two."
[00:07:30.000 --> 00:07:33.000]   "I failed when they were young, but when they get older."
[00:07:33.000 --> 00:07:37.000]   But you only get that period once during their life,
[00:07:37.000 --> 00:07:42.000]   and we want to make sure that we get that right.
[00:07:42.000 --> 00:07:50.000]   There are two people in the Scriptures that at the end of Jesus' ministry,
[00:07:50.000 --> 00:07:54.000]   where we can say they utterly failed.
[00:07:54.000 --> 00:07:56.000]   One is Judas.
[00:07:56.000 --> 00:07:59.000]   Both of them, Jesus mentions about satanic influence,
[00:07:59.000 --> 00:08:03.000]   where one was actually, Satan actually entered into Judas,
[00:08:03.000 --> 00:08:07.000]   and with Peter, Satan actually had influence on him
[00:08:07.000 --> 00:08:11.000]   and was able to use him to say certain things to Jesus.
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:13.000]   We know why that happened to Judas,
[00:08:13.000 --> 00:08:18.000]   because in John 12, 5-6, it states that Judas was a thief.
[00:08:18.000 --> 00:08:21.000]   On the surface, he made it sound like he was interested in the poor
[00:08:21.000 --> 00:08:24.000]   and why you're doing this, but behind the scenes,
[00:08:24.000 --> 00:08:26.000]   he was actually taking money from the money bag.
[00:08:26.000 --> 00:08:28.000]   He wasn't having integrity.
[00:08:28.000 --> 00:08:33.000]   So we can see why Judas was open to satanic influence.
[00:08:33.000 --> 00:08:36.000]   But with Peter, it's not that clear.
[00:08:36.000 --> 00:08:39.000]   Peter was a man who was very loyal to Jesus,
[00:08:39.000 --> 00:08:44.000]   and yet, Jesus says to Peter, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:08:44.000 --> 00:08:46.000]   He was being influenced by him.
[00:08:46.000 --> 00:08:53.000]   In Luke 22, verse 31, Jesus predicts that Peter is going to fall.
[00:08:53.000 --> 00:08:55.000]   He's going to deny him three times.
[00:08:55.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   And this is what Jesus says.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:00.000]   He says, "Satan has asked permission to sift you like wheat,
[00:09:00.000 --> 00:09:05.000]   but I pray that your faith would not fail you."
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.000]   Now, what does it mean to be sifted like wheat?
[00:09:08.000 --> 00:09:11.000]   You have to understand, again, we're not farmers,
[00:09:11.000 --> 00:09:14.000]   so we don't understand that illustration
[00:09:14.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   or the imagery that Jesus is giving.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   To sift something like wheat is kind of like the farmers at that time.
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   In order to separate the wheat and the chaff,
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:25.000]   what they would do is they would take a pitchfork
[00:09:25.000 --> 00:09:29.000]   and just throw it up in the air and let the wind separate the lighter chaff,
[00:09:29.000 --> 00:09:31.000]   and then the heavier wheat would fall to the ground.
[00:09:31.000 --> 00:09:33.000]   That's how they would separate what they wanted
[00:09:33.000 --> 00:09:36.000]   from the stuff that they wanted to throw away.
[00:09:36.000 --> 00:09:38.000]   Some of you guys who've been to India, the way they do that
[00:09:38.000 --> 00:09:41.000]   is they would just spread it onto the ground where the cars are coming.
[00:09:41.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Cars would run over the harvest, and then by the force of the car going over it,
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:49.000]   they would separate the wheat and the chaff that way.
[00:09:49.000 --> 00:09:53.000]   Now, the reason why they do that and the imagery that Jesus is giving
[00:09:53.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   is to separate what's valuable with things that we're going to throw away.
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:03.000]   So what Satan was asking was permission to test Peter,
[00:10:03.000 --> 00:10:07.000]   just like Satan asked permission to test Job.
[00:10:07.000 --> 00:10:09.000]   He said, "The only reason why Job is faithful to you
[00:10:09.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   is because you put a hedge of protection around him.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:17.000]   Take that away. Let me at him, and we'll see what's real.
[00:10:17.000 --> 00:10:20.000]   We'll see how much of his righteousness really remains.
[00:10:20.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   Give me a chance to prove to you that this is not your man."
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:28.000]   And so Job's whole story begins with Satan asking for permission to sift him like wheat,
[00:10:28.000 --> 00:10:32.000]   and the whole story of the book of Job is him being tested,
[00:10:32.000 --> 00:10:35.000]   and at the end, what really remains.
[00:10:35.000 --> 00:10:39.000]   So that's what Jesus was saying. Satan has asked permission to test you,
[00:10:39.000 --> 00:10:44.000]   to test Peter to see how much of his loyalty, how much of his love,
[00:10:44.000 --> 00:10:46.000]   how much of his faith was real.
[00:10:46.000 --> 00:10:51.000]   "Let me at him. Take away the hedge of protection, and see what remains."
[00:10:51.000 --> 00:10:56.000]   So what I want to do this morning is take a closer examination of Peter.
[00:10:56.000 --> 00:10:58.000]   What made him so vulnerable?
[00:10:58.000 --> 00:11:03.000]   And through the testing at the end, what was revealed about his faith
[00:11:03.000 --> 00:11:08.000]   that he was so vulnerable that Satan was able to have influence on him?
[00:11:08.000 --> 00:11:12.000]   Considering how close he was to Jesus, considering all the confessions that he made,
[00:11:12.000 --> 00:11:15.000]   considering everything that he already knew about him,
[00:11:15.000 --> 00:11:21.000]   why was Satan able to have this kind of intimate access to this man?
[00:11:21.000 --> 00:11:25.000]   So the first thing that we want to look at, number one,
[00:11:25.000 --> 00:11:29.000]   Peter's perspective was temporal, not eternal.
[00:11:29.000 --> 00:11:32.000]   Peter's perspective was temporal and not eternal.
[00:11:32.000 --> 00:11:35.000]   Jesus himself says that in Matthew 16, 23.
[00:11:35.000 --> 00:11:38.000]   "But he turned and said to Peter, 'Get behind me, Satan.
[00:11:38.000 --> 00:11:41.000]   You are a hindrance to me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God,
[00:11:41.000 --> 00:11:43.000]   but on the things of man.'"
[00:11:43.000 --> 00:11:45.000]   So Jesus explains.
[00:11:45.000 --> 00:11:51.000]   This is the reason why, Peter, you are being influenced by Satan.
[00:11:51.000 --> 00:11:53.000]   Why Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:11:53.000 --> 00:11:57.000]   Because you do not have the things of God in mind, but the things of man.
[00:11:57.000 --> 00:12:01.000]   The word for hindrance here is "skandalon,"
[00:12:01.000 --> 00:12:05.000]   and the word literally means "to make a trap."
[00:12:05.000 --> 00:12:07.000]   So in other words, what Jesus was saying was,
[00:12:07.000 --> 00:12:12.000]   "Peter, you may be saying these things thinking that you're helping me,
[00:12:12.000 --> 00:12:17.000]   but you are being influenced by Satan to put me in a trap."
[00:12:17.000 --> 00:12:19.000]   That's what Jesus was saying.
[00:12:19.000 --> 00:12:21.000]   In Proverbs 3, 5-6, it says,
[00:12:21.000 --> 00:12:25.000]   "Trust in the Lord with all your heart, and do not lean on your own understanding.
[00:12:25.000 --> 00:12:30.000]   In all your ways acknowledge him, and he will make straight your path."
[00:12:30.000 --> 00:12:37.000]   The reason why he tells us this is because our natural inclination is to survive.
[00:12:37.000 --> 00:12:42.000]   And our natural inclination is to make sure that our physical bodies,
[00:12:42.000 --> 00:12:46.000]   our physical life in this world is a better place for us to live.
[00:12:46.000 --> 00:12:49.000]   That's our natural inclination because that's how we are raised.
[00:12:49.000 --> 00:12:50.000]   This is the world that we were born in.
[00:12:50.000 --> 00:12:52.000]   It is the flesh that we live in.
[00:12:52.000 --> 00:12:55.000]   It is the flesh that we are most concerned about.
[00:12:55.000 --> 00:12:58.000]   But Jesus says, "Your perspective is wrong."
[00:12:58.000 --> 00:13:01.000]   And the reason why you do not have the things of God
[00:13:01.000 --> 00:13:05.000]   is because you're thinking about the things of man.
[00:13:05.000 --> 00:13:12.000]   See, in Romans 12, verse 2, the reason why Jesus says,
[00:13:12.000 --> 00:13:15.000]   "In view of this mercy, to present your body is a living sacrifice,
[00:13:15.000 --> 00:13:18.000]   to give it all to God, and not to conform to this world,
[00:13:18.000 --> 00:13:20.000]   but be transformed by the renewing of our mind,"
[00:13:20.000 --> 00:13:26.000]   because our natural mind doesn't think about the things of God.
[00:13:26.000 --> 00:13:30.000]   Our natural mind is concerned about this world.
[00:13:30.000 --> 00:13:33.000]   It's concerned about where we fit in.
[00:13:33.000 --> 00:13:37.000]   It's concerned about our investments and the things that we've done,
[00:13:37.000 --> 00:13:38.000]   things that we're going to do.
[00:13:38.000 --> 00:13:41.000]   If we work hard, what are we going to get tomorrow?
[00:13:41.000 --> 00:13:46.000]   And that's our natural inclination, and that's exactly what Jesus was pointing out with Peter.
[00:13:46.000 --> 00:13:49.000]   "Peter, you're concerned about this world."
[00:13:49.000 --> 00:13:52.000]   Jesus is concerned about the next.
[00:13:52.000 --> 00:13:56.000]   And because of that perspective, they could not understand what Jesus was saying,
[00:13:56.000 --> 00:13:59.000]   even though he made it very plain.
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:05.000]   In Matthew 16, 24, right after he says to Peter, in that passage,
[00:14:05.000 --> 00:14:08.000]   "Get behind me, Satan, because you don't have the things of God but of man,"
[00:14:08.000 --> 00:14:10.000]   he follows that up in verse 24.
[00:14:10.000 --> 00:14:13.000]   It says, "And Jesus told his disciples, 'If anyone would come after me,
[00:14:13.000 --> 00:14:18.000]   let him deny himself and take up his cross and follow me.
[00:14:18.000 --> 00:14:20.000]   For whoever would save his life will lose it,
[00:14:20.000 --> 00:14:23.000]   but whoever loses his life for my sake will find it.
[00:14:23.000 --> 00:14:26.000]   For what will it profit a man if he gains the whole world and forfeits his life?
[00:14:26.000 --> 00:14:30.000]   Or what shall a man give in return for his life?'"
[00:14:30.000 --> 00:14:38.000]   Did you know that that passage was in the context of rebuking Peter?
[00:14:38.000 --> 00:14:42.000]   That unless you forfeit your life, for Christ's sake, you will lose it.
[00:14:42.000 --> 00:14:47.000]   It's in the context of rebuking Peter for not having the things of God in mind,
[00:14:47.000 --> 00:14:48.000]   but the things of man.
[00:14:48.000 --> 00:14:53.000]   He wasn't simply talking to a generic multitude.
[00:14:53.000 --> 00:14:59.000]   He was talking to Peter, who was telling him, "You can't go to the cross.
[00:14:59.000 --> 00:15:02.000]   You can't be doing this because it didn't make sense to Peter."
[00:15:02.000 --> 00:15:06.000]   And so he's telling Peter, looking right through the surface,
[00:15:06.000 --> 00:15:15.000]   that your value is based upon what you think you're going to gain from following me.
[00:15:15.000 --> 00:15:19.000]   It wasn't just Peter. None of the disciples understood this.
[00:15:19.000 --> 00:15:24.000]   Because their whole paradigm was about this physical kingdom.
[00:15:24.000 --> 00:15:31.000]   In Mark 8.31-32, "And he began to teach them that the Son of Man must suffer many things
[00:15:31.000 --> 00:15:35.000]   and be rejected by the elders and the chief priests and the scribes and be killed,
[00:15:35.000 --> 00:15:40.000]   and after three days rise again. And he said this plainly."
[00:15:40.000 --> 00:15:46.000]   Mark goes out of his way to make sure that we understand that it wasn't because
[00:15:46.000 --> 00:15:50.000]   Jesus was speaking in parables or he wasn't making it clear.
[00:15:50.000 --> 00:15:54.000]   He was absolutely crystal clear. He made it very plain.
[00:15:54.000 --> 00:15:58.000]   In fact, if you were to study through the Gospels,
[00:15:58.000 --> 00:16:01.000]   at the end of the Gospels when Jesus is going to the cross,
[00:16:01.000 --> 00:16:04.000]   it's almost difficult to understand.
[00:16:04.000 --> 00:16:09.000]   How did the disciples not know that this was what Jesus was going to do?
[00:16:09.000 --> 00:16:13.000]   Because he kept on saying it over and over.
[00:16:13.000 --> 00:16:19.000]   "I'm going to Jerusalem to be killed, to be crucified, and to be raised."
[00:16:19.000 --> 00:16:23.000]   We know that they heard him, but they didn't understand him.
[00:16:23.000 --> 00:16:28.000]   So he said he was going to rise, but remember after three days?
[00:16:28.000 --> 00:16:33.000]   Nobody went. The only people that went were the women,
[00:16:33.000 --> 00:16:38.000]   who were there to anoint his body and take care of his dead corpse.
[00:16:38.000 --> 00:16:41.000]   And they were shocked that he was raised. But if you look at the accounts that Jesus gave,
[00:16:41.000 --> 00:16:46.000]   he made it very crystal clear he was going to die and he was going to be raised on the third day.
[00:16:46.000 --> 00:16:49.000]   It wasn't until after he was raised, lights started going off.
[00:16:49.000 --> 00:16:52.000]   It's like, "Ah, he did tell us this."
[00:16:52.000 --> 00:16:55.000]   But why did they miss it?
[00:16:55.000 --> 00:17:01.000]   They completely missed it because they had the things of man in mind and not things of God.
[00:17:01.000 --> 00:17:07.000]   When they were thinking to themselves about what Jesus was saying,
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:10.000]   it didn't fit their paradigm.
[00:17:10.000 --> 00:17:13.000]   Now we could look at that and say, "Well, how could they have missed it?"
[00:17:13.000 --> 00:17:18.000]   Our churches are filled with people who come to church every single Sunday
[00:17:18.000 --> 00:17:23.000]   and working so hard to make this kingdom a better place.
[00:17:23.000 --> 00:17:26.000]   Is it because the scripture is not clear?
[00:17:26.000 --> 00:17:33.000]   Is it because there's any kind of ambiguity in the Bible about what he says about the eternal kingdom?
[00:17:33.000 --> 00:17:39.000]   That all of this that we see, that we value so much, the comfort and safety that we want so much,
[00:17:39.000 --> 00:17:43.000]   even for our kids, all of it is under the judgment of God,
[00:17:43.000 --> 00:17:46.000]   yet it comes through one ear and completely out the other.
[00:17:46.000 --> 00:17:49.000]   We can talk about it in Bible study in small group,
[00:17:49.000 --> 00:17:55.000]   and yet all of our lives, our projection of life, has nothing to do with the kingdom of God.
[00:17:55.000 --> 00:18:01.000]   It's because we have the things of man in mind and not the things of God.
[00:18:01.000 --> 00:18:07.000]   That's why Peter, even though God made it very clear, at the end it didn't make any sense to him.
[00:18:07.000 --> 00:18:12.000]   In Romans 8, 5-8 it says, "For those who live according to the flesh set their minds on the things of the flesh,
[00:18:12.000 --> 00:18:16.000]   but those who live according to the Spirit set their minds on the things of the Spirit."
[00:18:16.000 --> 00:18:23.000]   To set the mind on the flesh is death, but to set the mind on the Spirit is life and peace.
[00:18:23.000 --> 00:18:28.000]   "For the mind that is set on the flesh is hostile to God, for it does not submit to God's law.
[00:18:28.000 --> 00:18:33.000]   Indeed it cannot, those who are in the flesh cannot please God."
[00:18:33.000 --> 00:18:41.000]   If our whole projection in life is to have a comfortable life, for us,
[00:18:41.000 --> 00:18:43.000]   and then the temptation gets really great when we have kids.
[00:18:43.000 --> 00:18:49.000]   I've never had, I won't say never, but I felt like when I decided to go into full-time ministry,
[00:18:49.000 --> 00:18:54.000]   when I met the Lord, the world to me, at least I felt like it died.
[00:18:54.000 --> 00:18:58.000]   And all of that began to resurface when I had kids.
[00:18:58.000 --> 00:19:03.000]   I'm not into cars, I don't care whether I live in a big house or not, or able to travel,
[00:19:03.000 --> 00:19:07.000]   but when I had kids, I wanted it for them.
[00:19:07.000 --> 00:19:09.000]   I wanted it for them.
[00:19:09.000 --> 00:19:14.000]   And it started to test all of the things that I thought was given to the Lord,
[00:19:14.000 --> 00:19:16.000]   it started all coming back.
[00:19:16.000 --> 00:19:21.000]   It's one thing for me to suffer and sacrifice, it's another thing for my wife to go through that,
[00:19:21.000 --> 00:19:26.000]   but it's another whole thing to see it being done with my children.
[00:19:26.000 --> 00:19:30.000]   And I had to wrestle with that, even to this day.
[00:19:30.000 --> 00:19:37.000]   And I've shared with you the passage that I memorized more than any other passage before I had kids,
[00:19:37.000 --> 00:19:40.000]   was "I have been crucified with Christ, it is no longer I who live."
[00:19:40.000 --> 00:19:44.000]   That's a passage that I meditate and think about often.
[00:19:44.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   But the passage that I struggle with the most in application is Matthew 6.33,
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you."
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:59.000]   And the reason why I memorize that and meditate on that constantly is because of that temptation
[00:19:59.000 --> 00:20:05.000]   to have man's perspective, to live my life like the rest of the world,
[00:20:05.000 --> 00:20:10.000]   to have Jesus and the world too.
[00:20:10.000 --> 00:20:14.000]   And we can completely miss, and if you take it further, you end up not wanting to hear it.
[00:20:14.000 --> 00:20:22.000]   And that's why the scripture says at the end times, people are not going to persevere with sound doctrine.
[00:20:22.000 --> 00:20:26.000]   Because it goes against what God wants.
[00:20:26.000 --> 00:20:32.000]   So if we're projecting our life to make this kingdom a better place for us and our children,
[00:20:32.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   and God is leading us to the cross, at some point that's going to intersect and contradict,
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:49.000]   and the only way to be able to deal with that is to nullify the preacher, or nullify the theology.
[00:20:49.000 --> 00:20:56.000]   I shared with you that years ago when we were out in China, I met an underground church leader,
[00:20:56.000 --> 00:21:03.000]   and he shared about how much of the health and wealth gospel was penetrating into the church,
[00:21:03.000 --> 00:21:11.000]   and he told me that he was part of that, and when I heard that, we decided to spend some time together,
[00:21:11.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   and literally spent no more than an hour, it probably wasn't even a full hour.
[00:21:15.000 --> 00:21:19.000]   And I decided to sit with him and go through the passage after passage,
[00:21:19.000 --> 00:21:23.000]   how the health and wealth gospel just does not fit the gospel that we know.
[00:21:23.000 --> 00:21:28.000]   It doesn't fit the life, it doesn't fit Jesus' life, his teaching, the apostles,
[00:21:28.000 --> 00:21:30.000]   nothing written in scripture supports what they're saying.
[00:21:30.000 --> 00:21:33.000]   So after about an hour of discussion, I asked him, "What do you think?"
[00:21:33.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   And he honestly said, "Well, I can't refute what he's saying,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:41.000]   because clearly you've shown me in scripture that that's what it says."
[00:21:41.000 --> 00:21:49.000]   And yet, he said the underground church in China said, "This teaching won't be popular."
[00:21:49.000 --> 00:21:55.000]   Now what was confusing to me was, he was a very smart guy.
[00:21:55.000 --> 00:22:01.000]   He was, I mean, I would say out of all the people that I met in China,
[00:22:01.000 --> 00:22:05.000]   who was raised in China, his English was probably the best.
[00:22:05.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   He sounded like a guy who came maybe to the United States, immigrated when he was a young child,
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:15.000]   and that's how great his English was. His vocabulary was far better than mine.
[00:22:15.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   And he was an editor for Xinhua newspaper, the English version, and so he was a very educated guy.
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:27.000]   Very well studied, very smart, went to the top universities,
[00:22:27.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   and yet all it took was one hour or less of sifting through scripture
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   for him to come to the conclusion that everything that he was learning and teaching was wrong.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:47.000]   Now why was something so clearly taught in scripture so easily rejected,
[00:22:47.000 --> 00:22:52.000]   and so few people are able to filter that out?
[00:22:52.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   And he was just honest with me, and he said, "It's because they want it."
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   It fits what they want. In fact, so many Christians, so many people are confessing faith in Christianity
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:06.000]   because they see America as a rich country, and Americans are Christians.
[00:23:06.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   So if you become Christian, you're going to become rich.
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   Even though it contradicts everything we know in scripture,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   and yet so many people, so many people claim to be followers of Jesus Christ
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:24.000]   and yet so many of us are adhering to that gospel, which isn't a gospel at all.
[00:23:24.000 --> 00:23:30.000]   Why is it so popular? Because it fits what they want.
[00:23:30.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   How much of our understanding of Christianity is what we want, and not what is?
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:40.000]   How much of what we are hearing and learning from the Word of God
[00:23:40.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   has to do with the truth of the Bible rather than the life that I was set before me,
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   and we kind of hear some certain things and then not hear certain things?
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:51.000]   That's exactly what's happened to Paul.
[00:23:51.000 --> 00:23:54.000]   In Colossians 3, 2-4, it says, "Set your minds on the things that are above,
[00:23:54.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   not on the things that are on earth. For you have died, and your life is hidden with Christ.
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   When Christ, who is your life, appears, then you also will appear with him in glory."
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   When it comes to our children, the temptation and the testing is great.
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:14.000]   Nothing will expose the idols in our hearts than when we have children.
[00:24:14.000 --> 00:24:21.000]   I remember years ago in 1991, I was choosing between coming to Irvine and L.A.
[00:24:21.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   For me, it was an obvious choice to go to L.A. than Irvine, because Irvine at that time was the boonies.
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   It still was pretty developed, but it wasn't as developed as it is now.
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   I visited Irvine in 1986 or '85 to visit a friend who was at UCI,
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:43.000]   and I remember getting off the 405 on Jamboree, and it was literally farmland.
[00:24:43.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   Right now, you have high-rises, condos, and all these new buildings,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:53.000]   but at that time in 1986, you literally drove through orange groves and farmland
[00:24:53.000 --> 00:24:59.000]   and smelled cows to get to UC Irvine. I was thinking, "Who goes to this school?"
[00:24:59.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   That's what I was thinking at that time, because it was in the boonies.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   Now, it's one of the top universities.
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:11.000]   When an opportunity opened up, I had a friend of mine who was asking me to come to Irvine to work with him.
[00:25:11.000 --> 00:25:16.000]   He was asking me to come, but L.A. is where I feel comfortable,
[00:25:16.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   because that's where my friends were, and that's where I got saved, so I was leaning toward L.A.
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:25.000]   Then I went and talked to the youth pastor that I was going to replace.
[00:25:25.000 --> 00:25:30.000]   He was trying to recruit me to take his place, and the lunch that I had, he started sharing.
[00:25:30.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   He started opening up with me why he was leaving.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:38.000]   This is what he told me. He said he was frustrated with the parents.
[00:25:38.000 --> 00:25:44.000]   He said when the kids started to really grow in their faith and really start giving their lives,
[00:25:44.000 --> 00:25:46.000]   the parents started to get upset.
[00:25:46.000 --> 00:25:50.000]   The parents wanted to drop them off so that they would be good kids and not join gangs,
[00:25:50.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   because this is in L.A., but as soon as they got beyond that surface and really wanted to dedicate their lives
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   and talk about possibly going to missions or ministry, the parents turned on them.
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:07.000]   He said he was so frustrated with the parents, one day he had a PTA meeting,
[00:26:07.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   and he told them, "Stop dropping your kids off on Friday night. I'm not their babysitter."
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:20.000]   He said he rebooked the parents, and then he wanted me to come and replace him.
[00:26:20.000 --> 00:26:22.000]   [laughter]
[00:26:22.000 --> 00:26:28.000]   I wasn't sure if he was quitting or he was being let go, but he asked me to come,
[00:26:28.000 --> 00:26:31.000]   because he was so frustrated with the parents, "I'm leaving, so would you come and take my place?"
[00:26:31.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Obviously, the answer was, "I don't think so."
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:38.000]   That's what propelled me to come to Irvine. I didn't know nothing about Irvine,
[00:26:38.000 --> 00:26:42.000]   but I came to Irvine, and then I've stayed ever since, in 1991.
[00:26:42.000 --> 00:26:48.000]   Nothing exposes our idolatry than with our children.
[00:26:48.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   We can be godly people in every other aspect of our lives, and if we're not careful,
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   we can be raising nominal children, Pharisees in the church, where Jesus is on Avenue to get what you want.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:05.000]   We make the sacrifices. We do everything for our children.
[00:27:05.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   They're memorizing scripture, Sunday school, VBS, and doing all these godly things,
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:17.000]   but at the core of our pursuit is the world through Jesus Christ.
[00:27:17.000 --> 00:27:22.000]   Peter was completely blind, because he had the things of man in mind and not the things of God.
[00:27:22.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   That was the first reason why he was vulnerable.
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   The second reason is because of Peter's confidence in his own flesh.
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   Remember, Peter says in Matthew 26, "They will all fail, but I will not."
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:40.000]   He had utter confidence in his own flesh. This is what made him vulnerable.
[00:27:40.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   Peter may have been the oldest of the group.
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:48.000]   Think about the arrogance of Peter, pulling Jesus aside and rebuking him.
[00:27:48.000 --> 00:27:55.000]   Some commentators believe that Peter may have been older than Jesus,
[00:27:55.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   and maybe that's where his confidence came from.
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:03.000]   Peter was a fisherman who worked with his hands, and he was a successful fisherman.
[00:28:03.000 --> 00:28:10.000]   If you remember the story of the paralytic, and they're in a home, and Jesus is teaching,
[00:28:10.000 --> 00:28:14.000]   and somebody breaks the house, and they lower him down.
[00:28:14.000 --> 00:28:20.000]   It was obviously a big enough home where they can have a meeting like that with a bunch of people.
[00:28:20.000 --> 00:28:25.000]   The commentators believe that that was probably Peter's home. It was Peter's hometown.
[00:28:25.000 --> 00:28:29.000]   So the fact that he even owned a house that was that big of a size,
[00:28:29.000 --> 00:28:35.000]   pointed to the fact that he was probably a very successful businessman, and he also owned his own boat.
[00:28:35.000 --> 00:28:38.000]   An average fisherman at that time was a hired hand.
[00:28:38.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   So the fact that he owned his own boat meant that he was at minimum middle class, possibly upper middle class.
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:48.000]   He wasn't part of the aristocrats, but he was a very wealthy man.
[00:28:48.000 --> 00:28:52.000]   So when they were asking Jesus, Peter, John, James, and Andrew,
[00:28:52.000 --> 00:28:57.000]   "What benefit do we have that we've given up all that we have to follow you?"
[00:28:57.000 --> 00:29:01.000]   They did give up quite a bit. It wasn't like they were in poverty,
[00:29:01.000 --> 00:29:04.000]   and these were people begging for alms outside of the temple.
[00:29:04.000 --> 00:29:07.000]   These are guys who were making a good living.
[00:29:07.000 --> 00:29:11.000]   And that's why, remember, after Jesus is resurrected, where do they go?
[00:29:11.000 --> 00:29:14.000]   They go right back, because they had a pretty decent life.
[00:29:14.000 --> 00:29:18.000]   They went right back, but they forsook all of that stuff to follow Jesus.
[00:29:18.000 --> 00:29:24.000]   So Peter was not a man who was just desperate when he met Christ.
[00:29:24.000 --> 00:29:29.000]   He just calculated that following Christ would be beneficial than not following Him.
[00:29:29.000 --> 00:29:34.000]   He was a man of courage. He was fiercely loyal.
[00:29:34.000 --> 00:29:40.000]   Strong leadership, and even other disciples probably looked up to him.
[00:29:40.000 --> 00:29:43.000]   That's why he's always mentioned as a first name among the twelve disciples,
[00:29:43.000 --> 00:29:45.000]   because he was a leader among them.
[00:29:45.000 --> 00:29:49.000]   So here's a strong man who's successful in his career,
[00:29:49.000 --> 00:29:55.000]   who has a character, and maybe even age, to garner attention and respect of other people,
[00:29:55.000 --> 00:30:02.000]   and it was that in and of itself that made him the most vulnerable.
[00:30:02.000 --> 00:30:11.000]   It is the areas in our life where we think we know is when we are the most vulnerable.
[00:30:11.000 --> 00:30:17.000]   He says, "Even if everybody falls, I will not fall." Luke chapter 22, 29.
[00:30:17.000 --> 00:30:24.000]   Or 33, Peter said to Him, "Lord, I am ready to go with You both to prison and to death."
[00:30:24.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   You know what scene that kind of shows me Peter's character?
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   Is when Jesus is walking on the water during the middle of the storm,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:35.000]   and everybody's freaking out, like, "Who is this?" And Jesus says, "It is I."
[00:30:35.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   And Peter's first response isn't, "What are you doing out there?
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:42.000]   Why are you walking on the water? Get in here." He doesn't say any of that.
[00:30:42.000 --> 00:30:44.000]   He said, "If that's you, let me come out to you."
[00:30:44.000 --> 00:30:48.000]   He's a man of action. He's not a guy who sits there and contemplates,
[00:30:48.000 --> 00:30:52.000]   and he's like, "If this is the right thing to do, I'm going to do it," and he goes out.
[00:30:52.000 --> 00:30:56.000]   And that kind of shows me his personality, his character.
[00:30:56.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   He convicts, and he acts. I mean, he gets into a lot of trouble because of that.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:06.000]   He doesn't think through what he's doing, but he's a man of response.
[00:31:06.000 --> 00:31:13.000]   He does things. So he had supreme confidence because in every other areas of his life,
[00:31:13.000 --> 00:31:21.000]   he probably was successful. Strong-willed man who garnered respect from his peers.
[00:31:21.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   But it's in the areas where we think we are successful, where we are talented,
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:32.000]   we are gifted, where we are the most vulnerable.
[00:31:32.000 --> 00:31:38.000]   Jesus said in Romans 12.3, "By the grace given to me," 12.3, he says,
[00:31:38.000 --> 00:31:42.000]   "I say to everyone among you not to think of himself more highly than he ought to think,
[00:31:42.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   but to think with sober judgment, each according to the measure of faith that God has assigned."
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:56.000]   He says, "Think with sober judgment." The reason why he says that is because when we're not sober,
[00:31:56.000 --> 00:32:02.000]   we begin to see things through our lens of whatever we think we are good at,
[00:32:02.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   and that's the area that we stumble the most.
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:17.000]   There's a reason why. Here's a man, Apostle Paul, who's gifted, educated, powerful in his testimony.
[00:32:17.000 --> 00:32:23.000]   Jesus deliberately makes him weak by putting a thorn on his side and caused him to beg before God
[00:32:23.000 --> 00:32:27.000]   to take it away, and he says, "No, because my grace is sufficient for you."
[00:32:27.000 --> 00:32:33.000]   And the lesson that he learns is when I am weak, he is strong. He deliberately makes us weak.
[00:32:33.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   He deliberately humbles us. He deliberately puts us in places where we don't know what to do
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   so that we can depend on him. When it comes to our kids, we have so many books.
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:48.000]   There are so many things that we think. Everybody has their opinion about what we ought to do,
[00:32:48.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   what we shouldn't do. If you do this, your kids are going to read better,
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:54.000]   they're going to behave better, and we control all of these things,
[00:32:54.000 --> 00:33:01.000]   and the successes that we have, not realizing, and the longer you spend time raising your kids,
[00:33:01.000 --> 00:33:07.000]   the more you'll realize how little control you ultimately have, because they're human beings.
[00:33:07.000 --> 00:33:13.000]   And it causes us to be desperate. There's a reason why the Scripture says in Joshua 1.8,
[00:33:13.000 --> 00:33:18.000]   as they are going into the greatest battle that Israel has ever encountered,
[00:33:18.000 --> 00:33:22.000]   and the consequence, they could have completely been squashed, humanly speaking.
[00:33:22.000 --> 00:33:28.000]   If this war didn't go well, the whole deliverance from Egypt, the whole wandering in the desert for 40 years,
[00:33:28.000 --> 00:33:34.000]   all the tabernacles and the sacrifice, all of this could have been squashed with one battle.
[00:33:34.000 --> 00:33:39.000]   Humanly speaking, they had no chance. And the only instruction God gives to the nation of Israel,
[00:33:39.000 --> 00:33:44.000]   Joshua 1.8, "This book of the law shall not depart from your mouth, but you shall meditate on it day and night,
[00:33:44.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   so that you may be careful to do according to all that is written in it, for then you will make your way prosperous,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:54.000]   and then you will have good success."
[00:33:54.000 --> 00:34:00.000]   In other words, humble yourself. Listen carefully to what the Word of God has to say.
[00:34:00.000 --> 00:34:05.000]   And don't turn from it to the left or to the right.
[00:34:05.000 --> 00:34:11.000]   It is often in the areas where we are the most successful, where we are the most vulnerable.
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:17.000]   Peter was deceived because of his own confidence.
[00:34:17.000 --> 00:34:20.000]   And that's what Satan was given permission to test.
[00:34:20.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Throw Peter up in the air and see what falls to the ground.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:30.000]   And the only thing that will touch the ground is your dependence on God.
[00:34:30.000 --> 00:34:34.000]   And that's exactly what happened. Satan threw him up in the air,
[00:34:34.000 --> 00:34:39.000]   and all the self-confidence, all the determination that he had,
[00:34:39.000 --> 00:34:42.000]   it was all blown away.
[00:34:42.000 --> 00:34:46.000]   And he was left desperate failure.
[00:34:46.000 --> 00:34:51.000]   And the only thing that remained with him is the grace of God,
[00:34:51.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   where he was weeping before him.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   "I wasn't who I thought I was. I wasn't as strong as I thought I was."
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   And that's why Jesus says, "Your spirit is willing, but your flesh is weak."
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:12.000]   And the greatest part of our sanctification is coming to a greater recognition of our weakness.
[00:35:12.000 --> 00:35:16.000]   So we come to the same point of Peter weeping before God,
[00:35:16.000 --> 00:35:19.000]   that we are desperate.
[00:35:19.000 --> 00:35:23.000]   And we are desperate as parents.
[00:35:23.000 --> 00:35:26.000]   You don't have it figured out.
[00:35:26.000 --> 00:35:30.000]   And until you and I come to that point that we don't have it figured out,
[00:35:30.000 --> 00:35:33.000]   we pray superficially.
[00:35:33.000 --> 00:35:35.000]   We cling to him superficially.
[00:35:35.000 --> 00:35:37.000]   Because we are not desperate.
[00:35:37.000 --> 00:35:40.000]   We kind of figured all things out, and then we want Jesus to come
[00:35:40.000 --> 00:35:42.000]   and make it a little bit better.
[00:35:42.000 --> 00:35:47.000]   It's almost kind of like we built the house, but we want security in what we built.
[00:35:47.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   So we sprinkle Jesus over it.
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   And that's the way our sanctification, that's the way our Christian life
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:54.000]   oftentimes looks like.
[00:35:54.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   We built it. We planned it. We worked hard. We built it.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:01.000]   And Jesus, can you protect this?
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:05.000]   And that's why so much of our prayer is about protection.
[00:36:05.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   Protect our children. Protect what we built. Protect our job.
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:15.000]   Protect our health. Because we worked hard for this.
[00:36:15.000 --> 00:36:19.000]   It is in our own confidence where we are the most vulnerable.
[00:36:19.000 --> 00:36:23.000]   And third and finally,
[00:36:23.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   Peter's weakness was his love for Jesus.
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:31.000]   Now we can look at that and say, "That sounds foolish."
[00:36:31.000 --> 00:36:34.000]   Because the Bible says the love of Christ compels us.
[00:36:34.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   He says to love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:42.000]   So how can his love be his weakness?
[00:36:42.000 --> 00:36:45.000]   I think Peter really did love Jesus.
[00:36:45.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   Even though he didn't have the clear mind,
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:55.000]   even though his worldly perspective caused him to hear certain things
[00:36:55.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   and weed out other things,
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:00.000]   when he said to Jesus, "This will never happen to you.
[00:37:00.000 --> 00:37:02.000]   How can this happen to you?"
[00:37:02.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I think Peter meant it because he loved Jesus.
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:10.000]   He was going to the cross. I mean, this is a man that he followed.
[00:37:10.000 --> 00:37:16.000]   I mean, I don't know about you, but if you've ever experienced any kind of activity,
[00:37:16.000 --> 00:37:19.000]   even for a very short period of time with a small group of people,
[00:37:19.000 --> 00:37:21.000]   you learn to love them.
[00:37:21.000 --> 00:37:25.000]   And I think the best reference that I can think of is when you go to short-term missions,
[00:37:25.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   you spend some time with those people.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:32.000]   And that short period where you sacrifice, you live together,
[00:37:32.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   you find out things about each other.
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:38.000]   And that's why I really enjoy going out to short-term missions with the smaller group
[00:37:38.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   because I get to, even though I've been at church for five or six years,
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:46.000]   sometimes that one trip out to China or India or wherever, or to Japan this year,
[00:37:46.000 --> 00:37:48.000]   it kind of solidifies.
[00:37:48.000 --> 00:37:51.000]   Oh, I learned things about you that I didn't before.
[00:37:51.000 --> 00:37:53.000]   And you come out as a team.
[00:37:53.000 --> 00:37:56.000]   It's not because there was strong team-building exercises.
[00:37:56.000 --> 00:38:00.000]   It's just we were just committed to the same thing, spent a lot of time together.
[00:38:00.000 --> 00:38:05.000]   These disciples spent two-plus years, almost three years.
[00:38:05.000 --> 00:38:08.000]   They risked their lives.
[00:38:08.000 --> 00:38:15.000]   They were in the storm, concerned about their survival.
[00:38:15.000 --> 00:38:20.000]   They were in the midst of people wanting to kill Jesus and walking through clouds.
[00:38:20.000 --> 00:38:24.000]   They fed the hungry. They raised dead people.
[00:38:24.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   And they were in the midst of all of this for two and a half,
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   so for several years they walked together.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   And so they genuinely loved Jesus.
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   And so when Peter heard Jesus saying that he was going to the cross,
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.000]   that makes no sense.
[00:38:40.000 --> 00:38:44.000]   Why would you go to the cross? I'm not going to let this happen.
[00:38:44.000 --> 00:38:48.000]   The problem was not simply that he loved Jesus,
[00:38:48.000 --> 00:38:52.000]   but he loved Jesus with a worldly perspective.
[00:38:52.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   He loved Jesus in his own flesh.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:39:00.000]   And that's what ultimately blinded him.
[00:39:00.000 --> 00:39:03.000]   You know, raising our children,
[00:39:03.000 --> 00:39:08.000]   I mean, you don't have to ask a parent to love your children.
[00:39:08.000 --> 00:39:13.000]   I mean, God gives us that ability to be able to do that.
[00:39:13.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   And everything we do is because we love them.
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:19.000]   We want what's best for them.
[00:39:19.000 --> 00:39:23.000]   And oftentimes it is the love for our children that blinds us
[00:39:23.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   to think that we're doing what's best for them.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:29.000]   But it's from a worldly perspective.
[00:39:29.000 --> 00:39:32.000]   It's with our own self-confidence.
[00:39:32.000 --> 00:39:35.000]   And if we're not careful in that perspective,
[00:39:35.000 --> 00:39:40.000]   that we can protect them ultimately from God himself.
[00:39:40.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   We think we're protecting them from the world.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:44.000]   We think we're protecting them from poverty.
[00:39:44.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   We think we're protecting them from harm.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:52.000]   But if we're not careful, ultimately we can protect them from God.
[00:39:52.000 --> 00:39:58.000]   Because God's primary goal is to bring our souls to himself.
[00:39:58.000 --> 00:40:01.000]   And he said, "If you do not pick up the cross,"
[00:40:01.000 --> 00:40:05.000]   and oftentimes we'll pick up the cross for our children.
[00:40:05.000 --> 00:40:08.000]   We'll pick up the cross because we don't want them to experience pain.
[00:40:08.000 --> 00:40:10.000]   We don't want them to be an outsider.
[00:40:10.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   So we do everything in our power to protect them.
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:19.000]   But in the midst of all of this protection, we weed out God.
[00:40:19.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   We've taken out the rough edges.
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   And we've made Jesus into Santa Claus.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Yes, he loves us. Yes, he forgives us.
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   Yes, he guides us. He answers our prayers.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:38.000]   Think about what must have been going through Peter's mind.
[00:40:38.000 --> 00:40:41.000]   Right before Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan,"
[00:40:41.000 --> 00:40:44.000]   Peter's the one who confessed.
[00:40:44.000 --> 00:40:47.000]   He was the one who confessed.
[00:40:47.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Who do men say that I am? Some say you're Elijah.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:51.000]   Some say you're the prophet. Who do you say I am?
[00:40:51.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   He says, "You are the son of God. You're God."
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   And he says, "Upon this confession, I will build my church,
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:02.000]   and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it."
[00:41:02.000 --> 00:41:04.000]   I mean, if there was any time when he had a spiritual high,
[00:41:04.000 --> 00:41:06.000]   it must have been at that time.
[00:41:06.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   He made the right confession.
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:11.000]   And he said, "I'm going to build my church upon this, Peter."
[00:41:11.000 --> 00:41:15.000]   And then the very next passage,
[00:41:15.000 --> 00:41:17.000]   Peter says, "You can't go to the cross.
[00:41:17.000 --> 00:41:19.000]   That makes absolutely no sense."
[00:41:19.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   And then Jesus says, "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:25.000]   Can you imagine what Peter must have been thinking?
[00:41:25.000 --> 00:41:28.000]   He probably was thinking, "I don't want you to go to the cross, Jesus."
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   And at the minimum, you would think that Jesus would say,
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   "Peter, you're pretty successful. You're older than me.
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:36.000]   Maybe you've experienced a little bit more like...
[00:41:36.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   I'll give it some thought."
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:43.000]   Or at least say, "Your intentions are good, you know,
[00:41:43.000 --> 00:41:45.000]   and I really appreciate your love.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   Now, you're willing to sacrifice. You really want to put your body out there,
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:49.000]   and you're willing to die for me. I appreciate you."
[00:41:49.000 --> 00:41:51.000]   You would think at the minimum he would say that, but Jesus says,
[00:41:51.000 --> 00:41:54.000]   "Get behind me, Satan."
[00:41:54.000 --> 00:41:56.000]   Can you imagine what Peter was thinking?
[00:41:56.000 --> 00:42:00.000]   Probably dumbfounded. "What? I love you, Jesus.
[00:42:00.000 --> 00:42:03.000]   Why would you call me Satan?"
[00:42:03.000 --> 00:42:09.000]   Because what Peter was saying was influenced by Satan himself
[00:42:09.000 --> 00:42:13.000]   because he was vulnerable because of his love.
[00:42:13.000 --> 00:42:19.000]   Every single one of us, every single parent, and every single child,
[00:42:19.000 --> 00:42:23.000]   we're all vulnerable because of our love.
[00:42:23.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   Love for our parents, love for our children,
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:28.000]   love for our brothers, love for our sisters.
[00:42:28.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   When we love them from a worldly perspective,
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:35.000]   we become vulnerable to Satan's attack.
[00:42:35.000 --> 00:42:39.000]   In fact, that's the area where we are the weakest.
[00:42:39.000 --> 00:42:42.000]   And it's not that Jesus or God is telling us
[00:42:42.000 --> 00:42:45.000]   to forsake everything to bring hardship.
[00:42:45.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   He's consistent because the only way to true life is Christ.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:42:56.000]   And it doesn't make any sense that we are so concerned
[00:42:56.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   about the speck of eternity that we live in here,
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:02.000]   that we do everything in our power to protect them
[00:43:02.000 --> 00:43:06.000]   so that they can have a good life during that speck of life that we have here,
[00:43:06.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   and to forfeit the eternity that comes after that.
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:13.000]   And what God is trying to save us from is that.
[00:43:13.000 --> 00:43:19.000]   Is that kind of worldly mindset that has been tainted by sin,
[00:43:19.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   that though we confess to believe in eternity,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:25.000]   that every decision we make for ourselves and our children
[00:43:25.000 --> 00:43:29.000]   contradict the very plain teaching of Scripture,
[00:43:29.000 --> 00:43:33.000]   that this world is passing away.
[00:43:33.000 --> 00:43:39.000]   One day, 100% of the people here will no longer be here.
[00:43:39.000 --> 00:43:44.000]   And the only thing that will remain are the things that we've invested in eternity,
[00:43:44.000 --> 00:43:48.000]   and that includes our children.
[00:43:48.000 --> 00:43:52.000]   So the very thing that we think are doing what is best
[00:43:52.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   can actually be doing Satan's work if we're not careful.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:04.000]   Matthew 10, 34-39, "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth."
[00:44:04.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Think about that carefully.
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:12.000]   "Do not think that I have come to bring peace to the earth."
[00:44:12.000 --> 00:44:18.000]   How much of our paradigm is influenced by trying to bring peace to our lives,
[00:44:18.000 --> 00:44:19.000]   to our children?
[00:44:19.000 --> 00:44:25.000]   "I did not come to bring peace. I have not come to bring peace, but a sword.
[00:44:25.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   For I have come to set a man against his father, a daughter against her mother,
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:33.000]   a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
[00:44:33.000 --> 00:44:37.000]   and a person's enemies will be of those in his own household."
[00:44:37.000 --> 00:44:41.000]   Some of you are probably experiencing that right now
[00:44:41.000 --> 00:44:43.000]   because you are following Christ.
[00:44:43.000 --> 00:44:49.000]   It has devised your home because you're taking your faith seriously.
[00:44:49.000 --> 00:44:53.000]   Your parents, your siblings, your friends.
[00:44:53.000 --> 00:44:55.000]   It caused enmity.
[00:44:55.000 --> 00:44:56.000]   And he says, "That's exactly why I came."
[00:44:56.000 --> 00:45:00.000]   And then he says in verse 37, "Whoever loves father or mother more than me
[00:45:00.000 --> 00:45:01.000]   is not worthy of me.
[00:45:01.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   And whoever loves son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   I pray that this Mother's Day, that we will be sober about the lives that God has given us.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:16.000]   That we are stewards.
[00:45:16.000 --> 00:45:22.000]   That our ultimate goal as parents is to bring them to Christ.
[00:45:22.000 --> 00:45:24.000]   Even if it is through the cross.
[00:45:24.000 --> 00:45:27.000]   To bring them to Christ.
[00:45:27.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   And at the end of our life, even the wildest dreams of being successful in this world come true.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   What does it profit if they do not have Christ?
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   Let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   And as our worship team leads us, let's take some time to come before the Lord in prayer
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:57.000]   because the greatest thing that we can participate in is to connect God with our concerns.
[00:45:57.000 --> 00:46:01.000]   Be anxious for nothing, but in everything with thanksgiving, with supplication,
[00:46:01.000 --> 00:46:09.000]   let your requests be made known to God so that the peace of God will guard your hearts and minds in Jesus Christ.
[00:46:09.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   So let's take some time to pray as our worship team leads us.
