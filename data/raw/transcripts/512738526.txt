[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.400]   Good morning.
[00:00:06.400 --> 00:00:12.120]   My name is Flora and I'm currently a second year at UCI and this is my testimony.
[00:00:12.120 --> 00:00:17.000]   I was first introduced to church at age four, just a couple months after my father passed
[00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:18.320]   away.
[00:00:18.320 --> 00:00:23.080]   This is when my mom, sister and I began to attend a church back home in San Francisco.
[00:00:23.080 --> 00:00:26.960]   I remember being a difficult child at church and in life.
[00:00:26.960 --> 00:00:31.720]   When I was put in the nursery, that meant I was apart from my sister who was two years
[00:00:31.720 --> 00:00:33.240]   older than me.
[00:00:33.240 --> 00:00:36.960]   I cried and caused so much trouble that the teachers just let me be with the older class
[00:00:36.960 --> 00:00:38.520]   to quiet me down.
[00:00:38.520 --> 00:00:43.280]   This self-serving attitude didn't stop there but continued on into Sunday school classes
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:46.840]   where I would bring books to read so I could avoid talking to people.
[00:00:46.840 --> 00:00:50.680]   In learning of the many Bible stories, my heart and heart stopped me from understanding
[00:00:50.680 --> 00:00:53.440]   anything past the point of gaining head knowledge.
[00:00:53.440 --> 00:00:57.680]   I couldn't dwell on the implications of God's love and mercy because I didn't see how his
[00:00:57.680 --> 00:01:01.400]   love, mercy and goodness was real.
[00:01:01.400 --> 00:01:05.400]   At this time, I was realizing how different my life was from my friends in terms of family.
[00:01:05.400 --> 00:01:08.560]   They had both their parents while I only had one.
[00:01:08.560 --> 00:01:13.600]   And while I can say this now that my mother is one of the greatest blessings in my life,
[00:01:13.600 --> 00:01:16.360]   as a clueless child, I didn't see this as enough.
[00:01:16.360 --> 00:01:20.400]   I saw the happiness in my classmates' faces when they saw their fathers pick them up from
[00:01:20.400 --> 00:01:22.800]   school and their joy made me angry.
[00:01:22.800 --> 00:01:26.520]   They would go on and on about how they had fun times with their parents, how they learned
[00:01:26.520 --> 00:01:30.600]   things about their dad and from their dads and the general exuberance that came with
[00:01:30.600 --> 00:01:32.120]   childhood bliss.
[00:01:32.120 --> 00:01:36.960]   But I saw how my mom struggled every day to raise two young daughters on her own.
[00:01:36.960 --> 00:01:40.560]   It came to a point where I was not just missing my father but I missed having a father in
[00:01:40.560 --> 00:01:41.560]   general.
[00:01:41.560 --> 00:01:46.320]   I continued to be a difficult child, stealing my sister's things and disobeying my mother.
[00:01:46.320 --> 00:01:49.960]   I even snuck out of the house sometimes because I didn't want to be there.
[00:01:49.960 --> 00:01:54.760]   My self-serving attitude blinded me and this also led to overall anger towards God.
[00:01:54.760 --> 00:01:58.840]   I was learning how God was good, loving and merciful but how could a God with those attributes
[00:01:58.840 --> 00:02:01.560]   do this to me and my family?
[00:02:01.560 --> 00:02:05.240]   As I entered middle school, my mom forced me to attend youth fellowship and although
[00:02:05.240 --> 00:02:10.000]   I reluctantly obeyed, I began to develop relationships with people that showed joy in learning about
[00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:11.000]   God.
[00:02:11.000 --> 00:02:15.120]   Their joy in spending time with me and showing love to me was what confused me the most.
[00:02:15.120 --> 00:02:18.960]   I didn't understand why everyone was being so kind and friendly to a person that all
[00:02:18.960 --> 00:02:23.480]   throughout elementary school wanted nothing to do with them.
[00:02:23.480 --> 00:02:27.120]   One of my advisors explained to me that the love displayed towards me comes solely from
[00:02:27.120 --> 00:02:31.720]   Christ because Jesus Christ loved the very people who hated him so much that he died
[00:02:31.720 --> 00:02:34.840]   and was resurrected for the forgiveness of their sins.
[00:02:34.840 --> 00:02:38.600]   My sins meant that I was destined for hell but Christ and his loving kindness saved me
[00:02:38.600 --> 00:02:43.760]   from eternal destruction and in this I desired for forgiveness of my sins and reconciliation
[00:02:43.760 --> 00:02:44.760]   with God.
[00:02:44.760 --> 00:02:50.600]   Ephesians 2, 1 to 3 says, "And you are dead in your trespasses and sins in which you formerly
[00:02:50.600 --> 00:02:55.040]   walked according to the course of this world, according to the prince of the power of the
[00:02:55.040 --> 00:02:59.080]   air of the spirit that is now working in the sons of disobedience.
[00:02:59.080 --> 00:03:03.880]   Among them, we too all formerly lived in the lust of our flesh, indulging the desires of
[00:03:03.880 --> 00:03:09.300]   the flesh and of the mind and were by nature children of wrath even as the rest.
[00:03:09.300 --> 00:03:14.440]   By nature I'm so sinful but and it is only by God's grace and because of his rich mercy
[00:03:14.440 --> 00:03:18.480]   that he softened my heart to be able to see the depths of my sins.
[00:03:18.480 --> 00:03:22.600]   I began to understand that my actions towards my family and everyone else was sinful, that
[00:03:22.600 --> 00:03:27.280]   my angry heart against God was wrong and that I was ultimately disobeying him.
[00:03:27.280 --> 00:03:30.920]   I prayed to God for forgiveness and mercy in my transgressions against him and I put
[00:03:30.920 --> 00:03:34.200]   my full faith and trust in the death and resurrection of Christ.
[00:03:34.200 --> 00:03:38.040]   The greatness of God's goodness and mercy and love became clear to me.
[00:03:38.040 --> 00:03:41.760]   Just because my father was gone does not mean that God does not love or care for me.
[00:03:41.760 --> 00:03:45.800]   In fact, it shows his love for me even more because it allowed me to come to know him
[00:03:45.800 --> 00:03:48.120]   according to a sovereign plan.
[00:03:48.120 --> 00:03:52.120]   Knowing that God ordained every moment in my life brought immense comfort because losing
[00:03:52.120 --> 00:03:55.240]   my dad as a little girl only brought me closer to God.
[00:03:55.240 --> 00:03:59.160]   I was no longer angry or bitter because I know his plan for me is greater than anything
[00:03:59.160 --> 00:04:01.280]   I could have wanted for myself.
[00:04:01.280 --> 00:04:05.560]   I don't have a physical father here but God is my father in heaven and because of this
[00:04:05.560 --> 00:04:09.160]   I can have full faith, trust, and joy through all circumstances.
[00:04:09.160 --> 00:04:15.040]   I no longer yearn to live for my own selfish desires but to glorify him in all that I do.
[00:04:15.040 --> 00:04:19.400]   My eyes were opened and I sought to obey Jesus as Lord over all aspects of my life and I
[00:04:19.400 --> 00:04:21.880]   truly believe that this is when I was saved.
[00:04:21.880 --> 00:04:25.800]   So I was sprinkled at my home church four years ago as an outward expression of my faith
[00:04:25.800 --> 00:04:27.600]   and devotion to Christ.
[00:04:27.600 --> 00:04:31.800]   Since then I've grown immensely in my love for God and in my desire to live by his commands,
[00:04:31.800 --> 00:04:34.080]   especially throughout my first year of college.
[00:04:34.080 --> 00:04:37.440]   I was reminded of the necessity of reading and wrestling with scripture so that I may
[00:04:37.440 --> 00:04:40.860]   correctly practice my faith and live according to the word.
[00:04:40.860 --> 00:04:44.480]   Because of this, today I'm choosing to be baptized by immersion in response to what
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.640]   the Lord has made known to me in scripture and to fulfill all obedience to his command
[00:04:48.640 --> 00:04:49.640]   in baptism.
[00:04:49.640 --> 00:04:54.720]   Psalm 73, 25 to 28 says, "Whom have I in heaven but you?
[00:04:54.720 --> 00:04:57.040]   And besides you I desire nothing on earth.
[00:04:57.040 --> 00:05:03.000]   My flesh and my heart may fail but God is the strength of my heart and my portion forever.
[00:05:03.000 --> 00:05:05.520]   For behold, those who are far from you will perish.
[00:05:05.520 --> 00:05:07.800]   You have destroyed all those who are unfaithful to you.
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.520]   But as for me, the nearness of God is my good.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.200]   I have made the Lord God my refuge that I may tell of all your works."
[00:05:14.200 --> 00:05:18.160]   Ultimately it's my desire for my faith to be biblical and backed by scripture, to live
[00:05:18.160 --> 00:05:22.200]   a life completely obedient to God's word and to be used for his glory and works.
[00:05:22.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   Thank you.
[00:05:23.200 --> 00:05:23.200]   [Applause]
[00:05:23.680 --> 00:05:31.680]   [Applause]
[00:05:31.680 --> 00:05:41.680]   [Applause]
[00:05:41.680 --> 00:06:03.680]   [Applause]
