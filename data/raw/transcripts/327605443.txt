[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000]   Okay, let me read for us our passage.
[00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:21.720]   Would you turn with me to 1 John 4, verse 19?
[00:00:21.720 --> 00:00:25.760]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:00:25.760 --> 00:00:30.420]   If someone says, "I love God" and hates his brother, he is a liar, for the one who does
[00:00:30.420 --> 00:00:36.200]   not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen.
[00:00:36.200 --> 00:00:40.480]   And this commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God should love his brother
[00:00:40.480 --> 00:00:41.480]   also.
[00:00:41.480 --> 00:00:42.480]   Let's pray.
[00:00:42.480 --> 00:00:49.480]   Heavenly Father, we pray that as we listen to your word that we would remember that this
[00:00:49.480 --> 00:00:54.920]   is something that is authoritative into our lives.
[00:00:54.920 --> 00:00:56.200]   Your word is not optional.
[00:00:56.200 --> 00:00:59.400]   Your word is not just a religious text.
[00:00:59.400 --> 00:01:02.560]   It is your direct word to humanity.
[00:01:02.560 --> 00:01:05.440]   So Father, as we listen, would we not just be convicted?
[00:01:05.440 --> 00:01:09.160]   Would we not leave with nice Christian ideas?
[00:01:09.160 --> 00:01:13.540]   But Father, would our desire be to live out the things that we hear?
[00:01:13.540 --> 00:01:16.080]   And so worship and love you with all our hearts.
[00:01:16.080 --> 00:01:20.680]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:01:20.680 --> 00:01:27.560]   Well, you know, one of the coolest things is at our old church, we've been here for
[00:01:27.560 --> 00:01:32.080]   a little over a year now, we had to, or I had to teach every Friday and preach every
[00:01:32.080 --> 00:01:36.560]   Sunday amongst other various Bible studies that kind of happened during the week.
[00:01:36.560 --> 00:01:41.540]   And one of the great pleasures that I think Kazia and I personally have had as we've come
[00:01:41.540 --> 00:01:46.200]   here is we've been able to kind of sit in at least one service of worship and to listen
[00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:48.600]   and to worship alongside you.
[00:01:48.600 --> 00:01:52.520]   And really, it's been such a joy for us.
[00:01:52.520 --> 00:01:58.080]   From day one, when we entered into these Berean doors, we were like, "Man, people are so kind,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.620]   so warm, so inviting."
[00:02:00.620 --> 00:02:03.620]   We loved it here from the get-go.
[00:02:03.620 --> 00:02:08.560]   And people, I think, are genuinely caring here, genuinely kind.
[00:02:08.560 --> 00:02:13.380]   The church, I think, ought to be this way, but what we're going to be hitting today,
[00:02:13.380 --> 00:02:19.460]   as you can kind of guess from the text, is that the challenge is that it goes much more
[00:02:19.460 --> 00:02:24.520]   than or beyond this kind of interaction with one another.
[00:02:24.520 --> 00:02:31.460]   This call to love one another is more than just being kind, is more than just exchanging
[00:02:31.460 --> 00:02:32.460]   pleasantries.
[00:02:32.460 --> 00:02:37.880]   And a question we could kind of think about is, what distinguishes the interactions we
[00:02:37.880 --> 00:02:42.460]   have with each other here at church with an interaction we might have on an elevator with
[00:02:42.460 --> 00:02:46.740]   a stranger, when we kind of say things to each other or not?
[00:02:46.740 --> 00:02:52.380]   Or maybe if you're washing a car in front of your house and a neighbor comes out and
[00:02:52.380 --> 00:02:57.860]   you're kind of exchanging pleasantries with them, or with some coworkers or just people
[00:02:57.860 --> 00:03:00.300]   you might know.
[00:03:00.300 --> 00:03:05.420]   What makes it any different than a social club you might be a part of?
[00:03:05.420 --> 00:03:11.240]   And the challenge is that we are called to love one another, and here's the difference,
[00:03:11.240 --> 00:03:15.100]   because God loved us.
[00:03:15.100 --> 00:03:19.220]   That's a striking challenge to us.
[00:03:19.220 --> 00:03:26.020]   That our love for one another is not to be anything less than how God calls us to love
[00:03:26.020 --> 00:03:27.460]   like he loves us.
[00:03:27.460 --> 00:03:35.100]   Because when we see the enormity of God's love, a love that went all the way to the
[00:03:35.100 --> 00:03:42.740]   point of sacrificing his own son on the cross, that we can't just settle with loving just
[00:03:42.740 --> 00:03:44.740]   a little bit better than the average person.
[00:03:44.740 --> 00:03:46.220]   And so we're gonna be going through three points today.
[00:03:46.220 --> 00:03:50.140]   The first is the reality, which is we love.
[00:03:50.140 --> 00:03:52.140]   That's the reality.
[00:03:52.140 --> 00:03:56.360]   Secondly, we love because God first loved us.
[00:03:56.360 --> 00:03:57.360]   That's the reason.
[00:03:57.360 --> 00:04:00.440]   And thirdly, we must love one another.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:01.540]   This is the result.
[00:04:01.540 --> 00:04:03.780]   This is the application.
[00:04:03.780 --> 00:04:05.380]   And so first, we love.
[00:04:05.380 --> 00:04:10.180]   And this comes from verse 19a.
[00:04:10.180 --> 00:04:11.180]   Very simple.
[00:04:11.180 --> 00:04:15.300]   If you look at your text there, it says we love.
[00:04:15.300 --> 00:04:18.900]   That word there is the word for agape.
[00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:21.140]   Many of us are familiar with that.
[00:04:21.140 --> 00:04:25.060]   And that term is a very loaded term, agape love.
[00:04:25.060 --> 00:04:31.340]   Agape is to love based on a sincere appreciation or a high regard of someone.
[00:04:31.340 --> 00:04:35.380]   Agape love is a selfless love.
[00:04:35.380 --> 00:04:36.740]   It's actually a love of the will.
[00:04:36.740 --> 00:04:39.300]   It's a decisive love.
[00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.940]   It's a commitment made.
[00:04:41.940 --> 00:04:46.400]   It's a strong love of pursuit.
[00:04:46.400 --> 00:04:55.420]   It's pursuing another person's good and not really being so consumed about your own.
[00:04:55.420 --> 00:04:59.740]   This agape love is different from philia love, which is brotherly or friendly love.
[00:04:59.740 --> 00:05:05.500]   It's different than eros love, which is romantic love, or storge love, which is familial love.
[00:05:05.500 --> 00:05:09.900]   It's based on the blueprint of God's love for humanity.
[00:05:09.900 --> 00:05:12.380]   It's ultimately where love draws definition.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:16.060]   Like all things, God is the standard.
[00:05:16.060 --> 00:05:21.500]   And that's why in 1 John 4, it says that God is love.
[00:05:21.500 --> 00:05:24.940]   R.C. Sproul says this, "In the New Testament, love is more of a verb than a noun.
[00:05:24.940 --> 00:05:27.660]   It has more to do with acting than with feeling.
[00:05:27.660 --> 00:05:31.740]   The call to love is not so much a call to a certain state of feeling as it is to a quality
[00:05:31.740 --> 00:05:32.740]   of action."
[00:05:32.740 --> 00:05:39.140]   Agape love is ultimately the way that God loves us.
[00:05:39.140 --> 00:05:42.900]   This is the love that is being repetitiously used here in 1 John 4.
[00:05:42.900 --> 00:05:49.980]   If you were just to do a cursory scan of the chapter, the word just pops.
[00:05:49.980 --> 00:05:52.340]   This isn't how we tend to use the word love nowadays.
[00:05:52.340 --> 00:05:59.220]   Like when we say, you know, the Disney love or rom-com love, based on fuzzy feelings.
[00:05:59.220 --> 00:06:05.640]   This isn't like when we say, "I love a certain type of food, like pho or steak or sushi."
[00:06:05.640 --> 00:06:07.500]   This isn't like when we say, "Oh, the sun's out.
[00:06:07.500 --> 00:06:08.500]   I love the spring.
[00:06:08.500 --> 00:06:09.500]   I love the summer."
[00:06:09.500 --> 00:06:14.140]   Or, "I love my bed."
[00:06:14.140 --> 00:06:20.380]   Notice how the expression of how we normally use the word love has much to do with self-centeredness.
[00:06:20.380 --> 00:06:26.380]   What an object of our love can give to us, and so it draws in us something.
[00:06:26.380 --> 00:06:32.340]   Its basis is found in bringing myself some kind of joy or happiness.
[00:06:32.340 --> 00:06:34.220]   But agape love is self-sacrificing.
[00:06:34.220 --> 00:06:39.080]   It looks at another person and how they could be loved.
[00:06:39.080 --> 00:06:44.780]   This is a love that doesn't ask for anything in return.
[00:06:44.780 --> 00:06:52.140]   This is a love that will go to war for the object of that affection.
[00:06:52.140 --> 00:07:00.540]   This is a long-lasting, it endures, it perseveres, it is steadfast, it's a heavyweight love,
[00:07:00.540 --> 00:07:07.060]   it's anchored, it's immovable, this kind of love.
[00:07:07.060 --> 00:07:10.620]   And again, it's modeled by God's love for us.
[00:07:10.620 --> 00:07:16.100]   And so it becomes very possible that even traditionally high forms of love, like a love
[00:07:16.100 --> 00:07:22.780]   that a parent would have for their child, that that might not be true agape love.
[00:07:22.780 --> 00:07:27.460]   That even a love that you might have for a good friend, that might not be agape love.
[00:07:27.460 --> 00:07:32.080]   Agape love is very specific.
[00:07:32.080 --> 00:07:37.700]   And so in verse 19, when it says that, it says very simply, very matter of fact, "We
[00:07:37.700 --> 00:07:39.220]   love."
[00:07:39.220 --> 00:07:42.020]   It's a clause in and of itself, that's it.
[00:07:42.020 --> 00:07:45.140]   There's a clause that comes after that, it says, "We love because you first loved us."
[00:07:45.140 --> 00:07:47.100]   But that first clause can be taken alone.
[00:07:47.100 --> 00:07:50.980]   We love is a statement of fact.
[00:07:50.980 --> 00:07:53.580]   It doesn't have any direct object attached to it.
[00:07:53.580 --> 00:07:57.620]   It simply characterizes that word, "We."
[00:07:57.620 --> 00:07:58.620]   That's it.
[00:07:58.620 --> 00:07:59.620]   We love.
[00:07:59.620 --> 00:08:05.180]   And then who's the "We"?
[00:08:05.180 --> 00:08:09.620]   If you look back at 1 John 4, verse 7, it says, "Beloved, let us love one another, for
[00:08:09.620 --> 00:08:10.620]   love is from God."
[00:08:10.620 --> 00:08:13.020]   And that's who it is, it's the beloved.
[00:08:13.020 --> 00:08:15.100]   That's the "We" that's being talked about there.
[00:08:15.100 --> 00:08:16.100]   And that word is agapetoi.
[00:08:16.100 --> 00:08:21.700]   It kind of sounds like agape, because that means those who have been loved.
[00:08:21.700 --> 00:08:24.180]   The loved ones.
[00:08:24.180 --> 00:08:27.980]   The ones who have been loved by agape love, these are the agapetoi.
[00:08:27.980 --> 00:08:30.180]   And that's us, that's "We."
[00:08:30.180 --> 00:08:31.460]   As the believer.
[00:08:31.460 --> 00:08:34.180]   This is the saint, this is the Christian.
[00:08:34.180 --> 00:08:40.620]   Believers are characterized by this.
[00:08:40.620 --> 00:08:44.300]   This word, there are different moods when you think of verbs.
[00:08:44.300 --> 00:08:48.500]   Three very common ones are indicative, imperative, and subjunctive.
[00:08:48.500 --> 00:08:50.700]   This word is an indicative verb.
[00:08:50.700 --> 00:08:51.740]   It's not an imperative.
[00:08:51.740 --> 00:08:54.620]   This isn't saying, "Go and love."
[00:08:54.620 --> 00:08:58.820]   It's not a command to us that says, "This is what you want to do.
[00:08:58.820 --> 00:08:59.820]   Do it."
[00:08:59.820 --> 00:09:01.660]   This is a fact.
[00:09:01.660 --> 00:09:03.340]   This is a statement.
[00:09:03.340 --> 00:09:06.940]   This is what we love.
[00:09:06.940 --> 00:09:09.940]   This is talking about a reality of what already is.
[00:09:09.940 --> 00:09:13.900]   There, of course, is an imperatival aspect of love.
[00:09:13.900 --> 00:09:17.860]   If you look at Ephesians 5, verse 1, it says, "Therefore, be imitators of God as beloved
[00:09:17.860 --> 00:09:22.860]   children and walk in love, just as Christ also loved you and gave himself up for us."
[00:09:22.860 --> 00:09:23.860]   That's an imperative.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.100]   So we are called to go, we are commanded to go and love people.
[00:09:27.100 --> 00:09:35.180]   Here, it's an indicative, a truth and reality of what we already are as justified, saved
[00:09:35.180 --> 00:09:38.980]   people.
[00:09:38.980 --> 00:09:41.940]   This is the truth of what we're called to.
[00:09:41.940 --> 00:09:42.940]   We're born again people.
[00:09:42.940 --> 00:09:43.940]   We are dead to sin and alive in Christ.
[00:09:43.940 --> 00:09:48.900]   The old has gone, the new has come.
[00:09:48.900 --> 00:09:50.020]   And now this is who we are.
[00:09:50.020 --> 00:09:51.020]   We are people who love.
[00:09:51.020 --> 00:09:53.980]   We're characterized by it.
[00:09:53.980 --> 00:09:56.340]   Why?
[00:09:56.340 --> 00:10:00.180]   Because this is what God is like.
[00:10:00.180 --> 00:10:05.420]   And so where we were so bent on loving ourselves, there is another lesser known Greek word for
[00:10:05.420 --> 00:10:06.420]   love.
[00:10:06.420 --> 00:10:07.420]   It's called philoutia.
[00:10:07.420 --> 00:10:11.020]   And that word is love of self.
[00:10:11.020 --> 00:10:16.940]   Now we are people who agape, love others.
[00:10:16.940 --> 00:10:19.700]   We are people who are sacrificial in our love.
[00:10:19.700 --> 00:10:21.420]   We are not self-serving in our love.
[00:10:21.420 --> 00:10:24.380]   We are not self-centered or selfish in our love.
[00:10:24.380 --> 00:10:30.700]   When we look across the world, when we look at the person next to each other, the type
[00:10:30.700 --> 00:10:34.460]   of love we're called to love with is this type of love.
[00:10:34.460 --> 00:10:35.900]   It's heavy.
[00:10:35.900 --> 00:10:36.900]   It's a pursuing.
[00:10:36.900 --> 00:10:37.900]   It's to their good.
[00:10:37.900 --> 00:10:43.300]   We don't walk through these doors thinking, "What can I get today?
[00:10:43.300 --> 00:10:45.020]   How am I feeling today?
[00:10:45.020 --> 00:10:48.820]   What is this person going to do to make me feel welcome today?"
[00:10:48.820 --> 00:10:51.740]   It's a love that says, "How can I love others?"
[00:10:51.740 --> 00:10:56.380]   And as every Christian walks through these doors, that we are entering in as people who
[00:10:56.380 --> 00:10:59.900]   love every one of us.
[00:10:59.900 --> 00:11:07.940]   And when the world sees the Christian, they see a person who loves as God loves.
[00:11:07.940 --> 00:11:10.940]   We don't come in just being kind to each other.
[00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:17.820]   We come in consumed with the understanding and the depth and the breadth and the length
[00:11:17.820 --> 00:11:26.540]   and the height of God's great love for us.
[00:11:26.540 --> 00:11:31.340]   And so, this is who we are.
[00:11:31.340 --> 00:11:36.380]   On a side note, that doesn't mean that they'll call us loving people, talking about the world.
[00:11:36.380 --> 00:11:40.180]   It doesn't mean the world will look at us and say, "You're loving."
[00:11:40.180 --> 00:11:43.940]   This world holds all sorts of insults at Christians who proclaim the truth of love because we
[00:11:43.940 --> 00:11:45.660]   don't preach a gospel that tickles ears.
[00:11:45.660 --> 00:11:52.300]   When we preach a gospel, that is a love and truth.
[00:11:52.300 --> 00:11:56.900]   It is a love that will smell of the aroma of life to those who are of life and the stench
[00:11:56.900 --> 00:12:02.660]   of death to those who are unbelieving, to those who do not know Jesus.
[00:12:02.660 --> 00:12:08.060]   That's why in John 15, 18 through 19, it says this, "If the world hates you, you know that
[00:12:08.060 --> 00:12:10.180]   it has hated me before it hated you.
[00:12:10.180 --> 00:12:12.660]   If you were of the world, the world would love its own.
[00:12:12.660 --> 00:12:16.060]   But because you are not of the world, but I chose you out of the world, because of this,
[00:12:16.060 --> 00:12:17.060]   the world hates you."
[00:12:17.060 --> 00:12:22.580]   However, with that said, the Christian is still characterized by love.
[00:12:22.580 --> 00:12:26.340]   They can look at you and not agree with what you're saying, but the world will still be
[00:12:26.340 --> 00:12:32.300]   able to sense in you something different.
[00:12:32.300 --> 00:12:34.420]   We are characterized by it.
[00:12:34.420 --> 00:12:40.700]   In Galatians 5, verse 22, the fruit of the Spirit, the first fruit, the first of this
[00:12:40.700 --> 00:12:42.380]   list of this fruit is love.
[00:12:42.380 --> 00:12:46.420]   It says, "But the fruit of the Spirit is love, joy, peace, patience, kindness, goodness,
[00:12:46.420 --> 00:12:47.420]   faithfulness, gentleness, self-control.
[00:12:47.420 --> 00:12:51.900]   Against such things there is no law."
[00:12:51.900 --> 00:12:55.700]   Some people think that the first word in the list many times becomes an umbrella to everything
[00:12:55.700 --> 00:12:56.700]   else that follows.
[00:12:56.700 --> 00:13:04.340]   It may or may not be the case here, but love at the very least is placed up front.
[00:13:04.340 --> 00:13:12.060]   In Matthew 22, verse 36-40, all of the law, all of the prophets, all of scripture is based
[00:13:12.060 --> 00:13:13.660]   on this concept of love.
[00:13:13.660 --> 00:13:18.580]   It says, this man who walks up to Jesus and asks, "Teacher, which is the great commandment
[00:13:18.580 --> 00:13:20.020]   in the law?"
[00:13:20.020 --> 00:13:23.140]   And Jesus said to him, "You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart, with all
[00:13:23.140 --> 00:13:25.120]   your soul, and with all your mind."
[00:13:25.120 --> 00:13:26.820]   This is the great and foremost commandment.
[00:13:26.820 --> 00:13:31.340]   A second, and there is a second, the second is like, "You shall love your neighbor as
[00:13:31.340 --> 00:13:33.020]   yourself."
[00:13:33.020 --> 00:13:36.540]   On these two commandments depend the whole law and the prophets.
[00:13:36.540 --> 00:13:41.420]   Many times we come into church, we live our lives understanding with great clarity and
[00:13:41.420 --> 00:13:45.660]   fervor that we are called to love God, and we will pursue and chase after that.
[00:13:45.660 --> 00:13:49.780]   But there is a second commandment that goes in conjunction with it, that is that we are
[00:13:49.780 --> 00:13:52.140]   called to love one another.
[00:13:52.140 --> 00:13:56.060]   In Colossians chapter 3, verse 12-14, it says, "So as those who have been chosen of God,
[00:13:56.060 --> 00:14:04.900]   holy and beloved," that chosen people, holy people, people loved by God, it says, "put
[00:14:04.900 --> 00:14:09.580]   out a heart of compassion, kindness, humility, gentleness, and patience, bearing with one
[00:14:09.580 --> 00:14:13.660]   another, forgiving each other, whoever has a complaint against anyone, just as the Lord
[00:14:13.660 --> 00:14:15.020]   forgave you, so also should you."
[00:14:15.020 --> 00:14:21.380]   And then he gives his last statement, he says, and Paul says this, "Beyond all these things,
[00:14:21.380 --> 00:14:22.380]   put on love."
[00:14:22.380 --> 00:14:28.180]   Beyond all of these things, put on love, which is the perfect bond of unity.
[00:14:28.180 --> 00:14:31.900]   In 1 Corinthians 13, verse 13, it says, "But now faith, hope, love abide these three, but
[00:14:31.900 --> 00:14:35.420]   the greatest of these is love."
[00:14:35.420 --> 00:14:37.260]   Christians love.
[00:14:37.260 --> 00:14:41.980]   And the question swings to us then, are we characterized by this love?
[00:14:41.980 --> 00:14:52.420]   When people say that you are a person who loves, if someone, if I were to go up to your
[00:14:52.420 --> 00:15:02.300]   co-worker, would they be able to look at you and say, "I don't agree with everything, but
[00:15:02.300 --> 00:15:05.380]   this is a person who loves."
[00:15:05.380 --> 00:15:18.380]   A family member, a roommate, when the world sees us, what goes through their mind?
[00:15:18.380 --> 00:15:22.700]   It's not a personal effort of love or trying to be kind or considerate.
[00:15:22.700 --> 00:15:28.620]   Do they see God and his love in you?
[00:15:28.620 --> 00:15:32.100]   See, this is really difficult.
[00:15:32.100 --> 00:15:35.940]   Even if this were an imperative to go and love others, this is not something you can
[00:15:35.940 --> 00:15:41.540]   muster up with sheer willpower or human exertion.
[00:15:41.540 --> 00:15:44.940]   Loving something is something that happens supernaturally.
[00:15:44.940 --> 00:15:51.340]   It's something that happens in the heart as it transforms you.
[00:15:51.340 --> 00:15:53.060]   So why does this happen?
[00:15:53.060 --> 00:15:54.660]   What is the reasoning behind all of this?
[00:15:54.660 --> 00:15:56.420]   Well, that brings us to our second point.
[00:15:56.420 --> 00:15:58.820]   It is because God first loved us.
[00:15:58.820 --> 00:16:01.940]   That is the reason why we are characterized by love.
[00:16:01.940 --> 00:16:04.020]   We love because God first loved us.
[00:16:04.020 --> 00:16:06.020]   And this is found in the second half of verse 19.
[00:16:06.020 --> 00:16:12.180]   It says, if you look there with me, "We love because he first loved us."
[00:16:12.180 --> 00:16:17.100]   As I was preparing for this sermon, I was wondering, "Man, is this too elementary a
[00:16:17.100 --> 00:16:18.100]   principle?
[00:16:18.100 --> 00:16:24.100]   Is this too much, like something we already know?"
[00:16:24.100 --> 00:16:30.980]   This statement is so just, you know, it's a verse you memorize.
[00:16:30.980 --> 00:16:32.460]   But there is some depth in this.
[00:16:32.460 --> 00:16:37.940]   In 1 John 4, verse 7 through 8, a little earlier on, before our passage, it says, "Beloved,
[00:16:37.940 --> 00:16:42.380]   let us love one another, for love is from God, and everyone who loves is born of God
[00:16:42.380 --> 00:16:43.380]   and knows God.
[00:16:43.380 --> 00:16:47.180]   The one who does not love does not know God, for God is love."
[00:16:47.180 --> 00:16:51.500]   See, our love for one another is because love is from God.
[00:16:51.500 --> 00:16:57.980]   So then anyone or everyone who loves is born of God, it says there, and knows God, it says
[00:16:57.980 --> 00:16:58.980]   there.
[00:16:58.980 --> 00:17:02.500]   There's some rationality going on here.
[00:17:02.500 --> 00:17:03.500]   Right?
[00:17:03.500 --> 00:17:11.500]   Like anyone who is born of God, anyone who knows God, what will it be?
[00:17:11.500 --> 00:17:12.820]   What will happen to them?
[00:17:12.820 --> 00:17:14.620]   They will love one another.
[00:17:14.620 --> 00:17:15.940]   It's a characteristic of it.
[00:17:15.940 --> 00:17:19.500]   And Pastor Peter was talking about like sounding and walking like a duck last week.
[00:17:19.500 --> 00:17:20.500]   I'll use a chicken today.
[00:17:20.500 --> 00:17:24.940]   If you think about a chicken, and you try to describe a chicken to someone, he has a
[00:17:24.940 --> 00:17:28.340]   beak, he has, he has, what else does he have?
[00:17:28.340 --> 00:17:29.340]   Feathers.
[00:17:29.340 --> 00:17:33.020]   He has feathers and that thing underneath, it's like a waddle, or I forgot what it's
[00:17:33.020 --> 00:17:36.100]   called, but there's that thing he has, and we see all these different things, right?
[00:17:36.100 --> 00:17:41.420]   And we look at this, and we say, "That's a chicken."
[00:17:41.420 --> 00:17:42.420]   Where did that chicken come from?
[00:17:42.420 --> 00:17:45.940]   It came from another chicken.
[00:17:45.940 --> 00:17:47.940]   Characteristics are passed down from chicken to chicken.
[00:17:47.940 --> 00:17:51.260]   That's just how it works.
[00:17:51.260 --> 00:18:01.460]   Now anyone who is born of God, anyone who knows God, will love.
[00:18:01.460 --> 00:18:02.780]   Why?
[00:18:02.780 --> 00:18:06.060]   Because God is characterized by love.
[00:18:06.060 --> 00:18:10.380]   God is love, is what it says here.
[00:18:10.380 --> 00:18:14.420]   You don't just go and grab an animal and staple up a beak or feathers onto it and say, "Here's
[00:18:14.420 --> 00:18:15.420]   a chicken."
[00:18:15.420 --> 00:18:19.780]   Neither can we be Christians who say, "I've been born of God, I know God," and we staple
[00:18:19.780 --> 00:18:23.780]   onto ourselves niceness.
[00:18:23.780 --> 00:18:27.980]   We're characterized.
[00:18:27.980 --> 00:18:34.340]   And we can have a lot of other good characteristics.
[00:18:34.340 --> 00:18:35.340]   We can have diligence.
[00:18:35.340 --> 00:18:38.060]   We can have knowledge of God's Word.
[00:18:38.060 --> 00:18:42.500]   In general, maybe we can even pray a ton.
[00:18:42.500 --> 00:18:45.980]   We could give to the poor.
[00:18:45.980 --> 00:18:51.740]   Without love, 1 Corinthians 13, we know that it means nothing.
[00:18:51.740 --> 00:18:54.420]   As we look, we love because God first loved us.
[00:18:54.420 --> 00:18:55.420]   As we look at...
[00:18:55.420 --> 00:19:01.060]   Okay, so God's love is the blueprint and the DNA that kind of gets injected into us.
[00:19:01.060 --> 00:19:04.540]   We're gonna be looking at three qualities as to why God's loving us first causes us
[00:19:04.540 --> 00:19:05.540]   to be people who love.
[00:19:05.540 --> 00:19:08.380]   And here's the first.
[00:19:08.380 --> 00:19:13.100]   Someone greater than us has shown us sacrificial love.
[00:19:13.100 --> 00:19:24.100]   Someone greater than us has shown us a love where he would kneel down to serve.
[00:19:24.100 --> 00:19:28.340]   Addie and Hudson, they're my two children, four and two years old now, and they've been
[00:19:28.340 --> 00:19:30.220]   fighting a lot more.
[00:19:30.220 --> 00:19:34.380]   And my son, Hudson, has been kind of running up to Addie and taking things from her.
[00:19:34.380 --> 00:19:37.540]   And she'll go and play with something else and he'll run up and take that thing from
[00:19:37.540 --> 00:19:40.380]   her and she'll go to something else and run up, take that thing from...
[00:19:40.380 --> 00:19:43.540]   And he'll take that thing from her and after a while, she just starts screaming, right?
[00:19:43.540 --> 00:19:45.220]   Because that's just annoying.
[00:19:45.220 --> 00:19:50.220]   So he starts screaming and screaming and it's really hard for her to share and we try to
[00:19:50.220 --> 00:19:51.300]   teach Hudson.
[00:19:51.300 --> 00:19:56.860]   But something that I realized is there's a difference between when I tell her to go and
[00:19:56.860 --> 00:20:01.660]   share and then when I model what it looks like to share.
[00:20:01.660 --> 00:20:07.500]   When someone of authority kind of does something, it makes it a lot easier for those who are
[00:20:07.500 --> 00:20:14.940]   just, say, underneath, those who are underneath to follow by example.
[00:20:14.940 --> 00:20:15.940]   That's just kind of how it is.
[00:20:15.940 --> 00:20:21.140]   We used to go to a restaurant all the time when I was a kid and my family would go to
[00:20:21.140 --> 00:20:29.020]   a place called Spires and it's like this diner and we always had the same thing, fried chicken,
[00:20:29.020 --> 00:20:30.020]   all this stuff.
[00:20:30.020 --> 00:20:32.820]   But it would always take forever because there would be a four-course meal that would come
[00:20:32.820 --> 00:20:34.860]   out for like four bucks or something.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:37.020]   And then so we would eat and I would get bored.
[00:20:37.020 --> 00:20:40.820]   And as a kid, I was very restless, I was very energetic.
[00:20:40.820 --> 00:20:42.700]   Addie is kind of like...
[00:20:42.700 --> 00:20:44.100]   She's from me, she's so crazy.
[00:20:44.100 --> 00:20:46.260]   Because I was crazy.
[00:20:46.260 --> 00:20:50.780]   And I would knock over my water and my drinks all the time.
[00:20:50.780 --> 00:20:55.220]   And my dad would get so, so frustrated at that.
[00:20:55.220 --> 00:20:57.100]   I would find ways to knock it over.
[00:20:57.100 --> 00:21:00.180]   They would move the cup all the way over and I'd somehow figure out a way to go and knock
[00:21:00.180 --> 00:21:01.180]   it over.
[00:21:01.180 --> 00:21:03.260]   And it's not on purpose, it's just...
[00:21:03.260 --> 00:21:04.260]   That's how crazy I was.
[00:21:04.260 --> 00:21:11.620]   Now, there was this time though where my grandfather was with us and my dad, he would get mad anytime
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:12.620]   I knocked it over.
[00:21:12.620 --> 00:21:13.620]   And he would...
[00:21:13.620 --> 00:21:16.580]   There was a stint where he would try to teach me.
[00:21:16.580 --> 00:21:17.580]   He would make me...
[00:21:17.580 --> 00:21:20.660]   If I knocked it over, he would make me go and ask the people for napkins and I have
[00:21:20.660 --> 00:21:23.620]   to get on my knees and I clean up all the water and stuff like that.
[00:21:23.620 --> 00:21:26.540]   And I'd be crying the whole time.
[00:21:26.540 --> 00:21:32.100]   And then there's this time when my grandfather was with us and he was a very quiet man.
[00:21:32.100 --> 00:21:34.260]   He doesn't really talk very much.
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:35.540]   And then I did it.
[00:21:35.540 --> 00:21:37.500]   I knocked it over.
[00:21:37.500 --> 00:21:39.980]   And what does a son do when you do something like that?
[00:21:39.980 --> 00:21:40.980]   You look straight at your dad.
[00:21:40.980 --> 00:21:41.980]   Like, "Uh-oh."
[00:21:41.980 --> 00:21:42.980]   [laughter]
[00:21:42.980 --> 00:21:43.980]   Straight at dad.
[00:21:43.980 --> 00:21:47.220]   And I looked and then I saw the fire in his eyes.
[00:21:47.220 --> 00:21:50.460]   And I was like, "Whoa, there it goes."
[00:21:50.460 --> 00:21:52.220]   But I remember this.
[00:21:52.220 --> 00:21:58.660]   My grandfather, he just quietly just grabbed a stack of napkins out in the middle and he
[00:21:58.660 --> 00:22:00.540]   just went under the table.
[00:22:00.540 --> 00:22:01.980]   This old man.
[00:22:01.980 --> 00:22:05.300]   And he just started wiping it up.
[00:22:05.300 --> 00:22:08.300]   What happened after that was so...
[00:22:08.300 --> 00:22:10.340]   It burned into my memory.
[00:22:10.340 --> 00:22:13.180]   Because my grandfather, he's like the patriarch of the family.
[00:22:13.180 --> 00:22:17.660]   Because my grandfather was doing that, my dad, it just extinguished the flames from
[00:22:17.660 --> 00:22:18.660]   his eyes.
[00:22:18.660 --> 00:22:20.140]   And do you know what happened?
[00:22:20.140 --> 00:22:23.980]   He just like, "Jet!" underneath the table and he started wiping it up.
[00:22:23.980 --> 00:22:28.100]   And before I knew it, my entire family was down there wiping it up.
[00:22:28.100 --> 00:22:32.340]   And I was just standing, I was just still sitting down like, "What just happened?"
[00:22:32.340 --> 00:22:33.340]   [chuckle]
[00:22:33.340 --> 00:22:38.820]   When someone greater than us shows a sacrificial love, it makes it much easier, I think, for
[00:22:38.820 --> 00:22:41.380]   many others to follow by example.
[00:22:41.380 --> 00:22:45.780]   Because when we see the example of what's given to us by God, in Philippians 2, verse
[00:22:45.780 --> 00:22:48.500]   5 through 8, this is one of my favorite passages in scripture.
[00:22:48.500 --> 00:22:50.420]   We see it so clearly here.
[00:22:50.420 --> 00:22:54.580]   It says, "Have this attitude in yourselves, which was also in Christ Jesus, who although
[00:22:54.580 --> 00:22:58.220]   he existed in the form of God."
[00:22:58.220 --> 00:23:01.220]   This is an astronomical assertion.
[00:23:01.220 --> 00:23:07.260]   "He did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but he emptied himself, taking
[00:23:07.260 --> 00:23:10.700]   the form of a bondservant and being made in the likeness of men.
[00:23:10.700 --> 00:23:14.300]   And being found in appearance as a man, he humbled himself by becoming obedient to the
[00:23:14.300 --> 00:23:20.020]   point of death, even death on a cross."
[00:23:20.020 --> 00:23:26.660]   God first loved us, and we can use that as a means by which we will arm ourselves and
[00:23:26.660 --> 00:23:28.340]   say, "We will go and love others."
[00:23:28.340 --> 00:23:34.340]   But we ought to stop and think about what that looks like and what that means.
[00:23:34.340 --> 00:23:39.380]   That God loved you.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:46.820]   God is the powerful and exalted God.
[00:23:46.820 --> 00:23:49.460]   God is transcendent over all things.
[00:23:49.460 --> 00:24:00.220]   If you've been in Colossians with us, it's staggering who Jesus is.
[00:24:00.220 --> 00:24:08.540]   God is powerful and holy and just and sovereign.
[00:24:08.540 --> 00:24:12.220]   He knows all things.
[00:24:12.220 --> 00:24:15.980]   He is the authority over all creation.
[00:24:15.980 --> 00:24:17.340]   He deserves everything.
[00:24:17.340 --> 00:24:21.820]   He is actually the only one that is worthy of every ounce of worship that can come out
[00:24:21.820 --> 00:24:25.180]   of us.
[00:24:25.180 --> 00:24:31.420]   His very existence demands our worship.
[00:24:31.420 --> 00:24:37.660]   If rocks could speak, it would start screaming "worship that God."
[00:24:37.660 --> 00:24:40.500]   All creation sings this phrase.
[00:24:40.500 --> 00:24:46.620]   Angels are worshiping day after day, minute after minute.
[00:24:46.620 --> 00:24:49.860]   And he chooses to love us.
[00:24:49.860 --> 00:24:52.820]   This is how God loving us first sets the course for us.
[00:24:52.820 --> 00:24:56.220]   When someone so great loves us, it causes us to love others.
[00:24:56.220 --> 00:25:02.020]   That's A. B, this is the second, love is shown for people who have no business receiving
[00:25:02.020 --> 00:25:03.020]   love.
[00:25:03.020 --> 00:25:04.020]   We can't just think, "Well, it's God though.
[00:25:04.020 --> 00:25:05.020]   He should."
[00:25:05.020 --> 00:25:07.020]   Because He is characterized by love.
[00:25:07.020 --> 00:25:12.840]   We actually have to sit and meditate and ponder about the enormity of what kind of took place
[00:25:12.840 --> 00:25:14.860]   on that cross.
[00:25:14.860 --> 00:25:19.260]   That this great and transcendent God didn't just love the best of us, He dispenses His
[00:25:19.260 --> 00:25:25.100]   love on the worst, on the sinner.
[00:25:25.100 --> 00:25:28.540]   As an unbeliever, there was a time I grew up in the church and I was an unbeliever.
[00:25:28.540 --> 00:25:33.060]   And I came and I thought I was a pretty respectable, good, nice person.
[00:25:33.060 --> 00:25:41.780]   High school yearbook, go to my high school yearbook, look it up, I was voted nicest person.
[00:25:41.780 --> 00:25:42.780]   Pretty good person.
[00:25:42.780 --> 00:25:45.500]   The next year, you know what I was voted in?
[00:25:45.500 --> 00:25:48.900]   Happiest person.
[00:25:48.900 --> 00:25:49.900]   Pretty nice.
[00:25:49.900 --> 00:25:53.540]   I thought, "What is it?
[00:25:53.540 --> 00:25:56.700]   Of course God should love me."
[00:25:56.700 --> 00:26:00.140]   And I saw myself, I viewed myself more as a person in the middle of the ocean that's
[00:26:00.140 --> 00:26:04.180]   like, "Okay, then I guess what I need to feel like is I'm a victim in this.
[00:26:04.180 --> 00:26:12.620]   I'm gonna go to hell, and so God save me."
[00:26:12.620 --> 00:26:20.580]   But no one pauses to think about what it looks like to save a sinner.
[00:26:20.580 --> 00:26:25.180]   Romans chapter 5, verse 8 through 10, but God demonstrates His own love toward us.
[00:26:25.180 --> 00:26:26.180]   Beautiful.
[00:26:26.180 --> 00:26:31.300]   He shows us His love, but then look at the means by which He does that.
[00:26:31.300 --> 00:26:35.580]   In that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:26:35.580 --> 00:26:39.220]   And we go, "Great.
[00:26:39.220 --> 00:26:41.260]   Look at that.
[00:26:41.260 --> 00:26:45.620]   While we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:26:45.620 --> 00:26:48.980]   Much more than having now been justified by His blood, we shall be saved from the wrath
[00:26:48.980 --> 00:26:49.980]   of God."
[00:26:49.980 --> 00:26:51.480]   That is, as sinners, deserve His wrath.
[00:26:51.480 --> 00:26:58.060]   Verse 10, "For if while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death
[00:26:58.060 --> 00:27:01.580]   of His Son, much more having been reconciled, we shall be saved by His life."
[00:27:01.580 --> 00:27:02.580]   Enemies.
[00:27:02.580 --> 00:27:07.100]   If you were to think about like World War II imagery, and there are trenches, and there's
[00:27:07.100 --> 00:27:10.100]   the enemy, and they're coming, and they're killing.
[00:27:10.100 --> 00:27:12.420]   They're killing your fellow soldiers.
[00:27:12.420 --> 00:27:18.540]   They're killing the people that you call your brothers, and this is just an atrocious thing,
[00:27:18.540 --> 00:27:24.420]   and all this craziness is happening, and bombs are flying, and bullets are whizzing, and
[00:27:24.420 --> 00:27:30.460]   all they want is for you to die.
[00:27:30.460 --> 00:27:35.740]   They're waking up and going to sleep, taking turns in the middle of the night so that they
[00:27:35.740 --> 00:27:45.420]   can continue that idea of trying to destroy you.
[00:27:45.420 --> 00:27:46.420]   They hate you.
[00:27:46.420 --> 00:27:53.500]   You know, this thing, this understanding of Romans 5, 8 through 10.
[00:27:53.500 --> 00:28:01.460]   While we were enemies, this is when God loves us, not with just some flippant love, but
[00:28:01.460 --> 00:28:05.260]   an agape love.
[00:28:05.260 --> 00:28:06.260]   Loving of our good.
[00:28:06.260 --> 00:28:11.060]   Have you ever had anyone out to get you?
[00:28:11.060 --> 00:28:14.980]   To make your life miserable?
[00:28:14.980 --> 00:28:15.980]   To destroy you?
[00:28:15.980 --> 00:28:19.500]   Someone that wants to hurt you, or said slanderous things about you?
[00:28:19.500 --> 00:28:29.900]   Someone who's screaming at you, and spits in your face, maybe metaphorically or whatever?
[00:28:29.900 --> 00:28:36.300]   Have you ever had anyone who actually wants to kill you, because they hate you so much?
[00:28:36.300 --> 00:28:46.660]   With every last fiber of their being, just vitriol and venom against you.
[00:28:46.660 --> 00:28:56.420]   Have you ever thought what it is for transcendent God to love you?
[00:28:56.420 --> 00:29:00.660]   That's why in Luke 6, verse 31, it says, "Treat others the same way you want them to treat
[00:29:00.660 --> 00:29:01.660]   you.
[00:29:01.660 --> 00:29:03.540]   If you love those who love you, what credit is that to you?
[00:29:03.540 --> 00:29:05.300]   For even sinners love those who love them.
[00:29:05.300 --> 00:29:07.660]   If you do good to those who do good to you, what credit is that to you?
[00:29:07.660 --> 00:29:10.100]   For even sinners do the same.
[00:29:10.100 --> 00:29:14.980]   If you lend to those from whom you expect to receive, what credit is that to you?
[00:29:14.980 --> 00:29:18.380]   Even sinners lend to sinners in order to receive back the same amount.
[00:29:18.380 --> 00:29:27.380]   Here it is, but you love your enemies and do good, and lend expecting nothing in return,
[00:29:27.380 --> 00:29:30.780]   and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High."
[00:29:30.780 --> 00:29:34.420]   He uses that term on purpose, sons.
[00:29:34.420 --> 00:29:40.420]   The DNA passed from father to son, sons of the Most High, for he himself is kind to ungrateful
[00:29:40.420 --> 00:29:42.420]   and evil men.
[00:29:42.420 --> 00:29:45.220]   Be merciful just as your father is merciful.
[00:29:45.220 --> 00:29:48.540]   That's the second reason why God's example of love causes us to love others.
[00:29:48.540 --> 00:29:53.720]   He loved undeserving and wretched people.
[00:29:53.720 --> 00:30:00.820]   If God can love a wretch like me, it is infinitely easier for me to love other wretches.
[00:30:00.820 --> 00:30:10.420]   And finally, this letter C, God's love for us came at great personal cost.
[00:30:10.420 --> 00:30:12.460]   It cost the life of his very own son.
[00:30:12.460 --> 00:30:17.820]   Now, we can't take too much time to go into it, but I was meditating on Genesis 22 again.
[00:30:17.820 --> 00:30:22.180]   I really love the story where Abraham is called to sacrifice his only son, Isaac.
[00:30:22.180 --> 00:30:23.260]   Remember how old he is.
[00:30:23.260 --> 00:30:24.260]   This is it.
[00:30:24.260 --> 00:30:26.020]   This is the only son he's going to get.
[00:30:26.020 --> 00:30:29.660]   And God says, "Go up and sacrifice him."
[00:30:29.660 --> 00:30:34.060]   Abraham, you know, like, "Okay, God must know what he's doing," goes and walks up this hill
[00:30:34.060 --> 00:30:35.780]   with Isaac and straps on him.
[00:30:35.780 --> 00:30:39.980]   You can just imagine putting onto your own son the wood by which you're going to burn
[00:30:39.980 --> 00:30:47.740]   him, wielding the knife that you know you're going to kill your son with.
[00:30:47.740 --> 00:30:52.780]   And without thinking too much about, "Well, I would God command him to do such a thing."
[00:30:52.780 --> 00:30:54.780]   That's not for today.
[00:30:54.780 --> 00:31:01.660]   He goes up and he lays down his son Isaac on this altar and he binds him, stares down
[00:31:01.660 --> 00:31:02.660]   at his face.
[00:31:02.660 --> 00:31:04.420]   And what's Isaac going to do?
[00:31:04.420 --> 00:31:06.100]   He's not going to be humming.
[00:31:06.100 --> 00:31:10.620]   He's going to be staring at his father straight in the face.
[00:31:10.620 --> 00:31:11.700]   And Abraham was ready to do it.
[00:31:11.700 --> 00:31:15.060]   He was ready to kill his own son.
[00:31:15.060 --> 00:31:23.180]   Now, we can look at that and question what God's doing there, but whatever the case,
[00:31:23.180 --> 00:31:25.180]   God stops him.
[00:31:25.180 --> 00:31:26.220]   Think about that.
[00:31:26.220 --> 00:31:31.300]   He stops him from killing his own son.
[00:31:31.300 --> 00:31:35.020]   Can you think about the cross?
[00:31:35.020 --> 00:31:41.300]   Cross by which Jesus walks up a hill with wood strapped to his back.
[00:31:41.300 --> 00:31:44.860]   Goes up and what happens as he's nailed to the cross?
[00:31:44.860 --> 00:31:45.860]   We see it sometimes.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:55.380]   That as a son cries out for his father, father looks down upon his son and he turns his face
[00:31:55.380 --> 00:32:00.260]   away.
[00:32:00.260 --> 00:32:04.220]   That is great personal cost.
[00:32:04.220 --> 00:32:09.180]   We love because he first loved us.
[00:32:09.180 --> 00:32:12.180]   Transcendent God loves us.
[00:32:12.180 --> 00:32:16.300]   Transcendent God loves sinners.
[00:32:16.300 --> 00:32:28.580]   Not only that, what it cost to purchase the sinner, the wretch, the enemy, cost Jesus.
[00:32:28.580 --> 00:32:33.420]   We think because he's alive again and that understanding of the fact that he rose from
[00:32:33.420 --> 00:32:38.940]   the dead, that fine, great, but we forget to realize and we forget and we don't realize
[00:32:38.940 --> 00:32:48.060]   that Jesus took eternal wrath for us.
[00:32:48.060 --> 00:32:55.900]   So are you a person characterized by this kind of love?
[00:32:55.900 --> 00:32:57.860]   Does this Agape love characterize you?
[00:32:57.860 --> 00:33:00.660]   Do you follow in the example of God's love for you?
[00:33:00.660 --> 00:33:07.860]   Does this great love for you cause you to transform in heart?
[00:33:07.860 --> 00:33:11.500]   That we don't walk through those doors just thinking, "What can I get today?"
[00:33:11.500 --> 00:33:16.020]   We walk through those doors with that kind of love becoming the framework, becoming the
[00:33:16.020 --> 00:33:18.460]   vehicle by which we love one another.
[00:33:18.460 --> 00:33:22.020]   Because this brings us into our final point.
[00:33:22.020 --> 00:33:24.500]   Let me bridge this into it with just a couple of verses here.
[00:33:24.500 --> 00:33:28.020]   But in John 13, 34, that's why the world, it says this, that the world will know us.
[00:33:28.020 --> 00:33:32.580]   A new commandment I give to you that you love one another even as I have loved you, that
[00:33:32.580 --> 00:33:33.580]   you also love one another.
[00:33:33.580 --> 00:33:40.620]   By this all men will know that you are my disciples if you have love for one another.
[00:33:40.620 --> 00:33:44.620]   Dwight Moody says the world does not understand theology or dogma, but it understands love
[00:33:44.620 --> 00:33:46.900]   and sympathy.
[00:33:46.900 --> 00:33:50.900]   And so the third and final point here then is we must love one another.
[00:33:50.900 --> 00:33:51.900]   That's verse 20 through 21.
[00:33:51.900 --> 00:33:57.340]   And it says, "If someone says, 'I love God,' and hates his brother, he is a liar.
[00:33:57.340 --> 00:34:00.940]   For the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has
[00:34:00.940 --> 00:34:01.940]   not seen."
[00:34:01.940 --> 00:34:06.340]   And this commandment we have from him that the one who loves God should love his brother
[00:34:06.340 --> 00:34:07.340]   also.
[00:34:07.340 --> 00:34:12.060]   And here you have to unpack that.
[00:34:12.060 --> 00:34:16.620]   As the person who says, "I love God," and hates his brother is a liar.
[00:34:16.620 --> 00:34:20.060]   He's saying, "How can you love your brother who's right here next to you?"
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:21.120]   You're saying you love him.
[00:34:21.120 --> 00:34:22.120]   You can't love him.
[00:34:22.120 --> 00:34:27.520]   I'm sorry, you can't love God without loving him.
[00:34:27.520 --> 00:34:31.040]   That's what it's saying here in this passage.
[00:34:31.040 --> 00:34:33.160]   But this is the direct result.
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.000]   This is the application that we are called to love one another with this same love.
[00:34:38.000 --> 00:34:42.080]   It's talking specifically about brothers here.
[00:34:42.080 --> 00:34:43.440]   This is Christian brothers and sisters.
[00:34:43.440 --> 00:34:44.880]   This is, these are believers.
[00:34:44.880 --> 00:34:47.720]   This is the church, specifically.
[00:34:47.720 --> 00:34:50.520]   And we might ask that question, "What about non-believers?
[00:34:50.520 --> 00:34:53.080]   Are we not called to love them with this kind of love?"
[00:34:53.080 --> 00:35:00.040]   Well, what this is more saying is we ought to be loving people who are closest to us.
[00:35:00.040 --> 00:35:03.440]   If we don't love our own family and we're going around loving all these other people,
[00:35:03.440 --> 00:35:05.840]   you ought to be questioning what your love is even made up of.
[00:35:05.840 --> 00:35:10.240]   I've seen people, and I'm guilty of it, going around loving other people and maybe I don't
[00:35:10.240 --> 00:35:14.280]   love my family.
[00:35:14.280 --> 00:35:21.200]   I've seen people who love and serve others so much and neglect their parents.
[00:35:21.200 --> 00:35:22.760]   In the home, you see the true self.
[00:35:22.760 --> 00:35:26.880]   With others outside, you can fake it because you can turn it on and off.
[00:35:26.880 --> 00:35:27.880]   You can control it.
[00:35:27.880 --> 00:35:28.880]   But in the home, you can't control it.
[00:35:28.880 --> 00:35:31.240]   You're always with them.
[00:35:31.240 --> 00:35:35.400]   You are who you are in the home.
[00:35:35.400 --> 00:35:36.960]   And the church, then, is a family.
[00:35:36.960 --> 00:35:40.920]   But many times, we don't act as if it were.
[00:35:40.920 --> 00:35:44.400]   That's why church is something we do on weekends or during apportioned times.
[00:35:44.400 --> 00:35:48.200]   Rather than invest in the church as how Scripture calls it to be.
[00:35:48.200 --> 00:35:50.720]   It's brothers and sisters.
[00:35:50.720 --> 00:35:54.800]   And so this is a direct call for believers to specifically love each other with God's
[00:35:54.800 --> 00:35:57.260]   love.
[00:35:57.260 --> 00:36:01.000]   This is how the body of Christ is to be built up and loved.
[00:36:01.000 --> 00:36:02.360]   This is the DNA of the church.
[00:36:02.360 --> 00:36:07.240]   This is the thing that kind of flows through us.
[00:36:07.240 --> 00:36:14.400]   We pull together a bunch of people who have been loved by this weighty love of God.
[00:36:14.400 --> 00:36:15.400]   They begin to love each other.
[00:36:15.400 --> 00:36:21.680]   They love non-believers as well, but there's a special form of love that happens in a pool
[00:36:21.680 --> 00:36:26.440]   of believers.
[00:36:26.440 --> 00:36:29.560]   Unbelievers are incapable of loving with God's love.
[00:36:29.560 --> 00:36:32.680]   And this isn't a knock on unbelievers.
[00:36:32.680 --> 00:36:38.240]   This isn't to say that they're incapable of some form of love.
[00:36:38.240 --> 00:36:42.720]   The true Agape love, only believers are capable of it.
[00:36:42.720 --> 00:36:44.520]   Because you have been transformed into it.
[00:36:44.520 --> 00:36:47.640]   And so you bring these people together, and you get what you see in Romans 12.
[00:36:47.640 --> 00:36:49.380]   It's almost a competition of love.
[00:36:49.380 --> 00:36:54.160]   People outdoing one another and showing each other honor.
[00:36:54.160 --> 00:36:55.160]   Genuine love is there.
[00:36:55.160 --> 00:36:59.760]   Kind of something that sticks to each other.
[00:36:59.760 --> 00:37:03.840]   But here, he uses the word hate in verse 20.
[00:37:03.840 --> 00:37:04.840]   If you look there.
[00:37:04.840 --> 00:37:07.440]   If someone says, "I love God," and hates his brother.
[00:37:07.440 --> 00:37:08.560]   Hate.
[00:37:08.560 --> 00:37:13.600]   That is to dislike strongly with the implication of aversion and hostility towards somebody.
[00:37:13.600 --> 00:37:16.800]   Obviously, there are people you might hate.
[00:37:16.800 --> 00:37:20.440]   There are people who might have said something against you, or maybe you don't like the way
[00:37:20.440 --> 00:37:22.280]   they hold themselves.
[00:37:22.280 --> 00:37:23.280]   People you would consider enemies.
[00:37:23.280 --> 00:37:30.000]   Maybe people that you would think, "That's a bad person."
[00:37:30.000 --> 00:37:33.480]   You might actually even find yourself doing that here in our church.
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:36.280]   We're not above it.
[00:37:36.280 --> 00:37:43.440]   When you see people backstabbing, when we see churches splitting, there's active hate
[00:37:43.440 --> 00:37:44.440]   there.
[00:37:44.440 --> 00:37:50.440]   And we ought never to think that it can't happen here.
[00:37:50.440 --> 00:37:57.040]   And hate starts small, and it grows, and it grows.
[00:37:57.040 --> 00:38:00.800]   First John chapter 3 verse 14 takes the understanding of hate even a bit further.
[00:38:00.800 --> 00:38:04.840]   It says, "We know that we have passed out of death into life because we love the brethren.
[00:38:04.840 --> 00:38:07.200]   He who does not love abides in death."
[00:38:07.200 --> 00:38:08.200]   Verse 15.
[00:38:08.200 --> 00:38:12.320]   "Everyone who hates his brother is a murderer, and you know that no murderer has eternal
[00:38:12.320 --> 00:38:13.800]   life abiding in him.
[00:38:13.800 --> 00:38:18.320]   We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us, and we ought to lay down our
[00:38:18.320 --> 00:38:19.840]   lives for the brethren.
[00:38:19.840 --> 00:38:24.560]   But whoever has the world's goods and sees his brother in need and closes his heart against
[00:38:24.560 --> 00:38:28.520]   him, how does the love of God abide in him?
[00:38:28.520 --> 00:38:32.040]   Little children, let us not love with word or with tongue, but in deed and truth."
[00:38:32.040 --> 00:38:35.520]   What's striking here in First John 3 is how hate is described.
[00:38:35.520 --> 00:38:42.320]   It's not described just as bitterness, or vitriol, or annoyance, or fighting words,
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:46.320]   or slander, or attacking.
[00:38:46.320 --> 00:38:53.440]   It's described as someone who sees a brother in need and closes his heart against him.
[00:38:53.440 --> 00:38:58.240]   This is actually shown as someone who is not a loving person.
[00:38:58.240 --> 00:39:02.920]   So it's not just outright hostility against someone.
[00:39:02.920 --> 00:39:07.800]   And so in First John chapter 4 verse 20, going back to our text, that's why hating and not
[00:39:07.800 --> 00:39:13.760]   loving is actually much more similar than you might think.
[00:39:13.760 --> 00:39:16.280]   It seems almost an absurd parallel, but it's not.
[00:39:16.280 --> 00:39:21.000]   Because a Christian who is born of God will love as God loves.
[00:39:21.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   That's the reality.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.800]   God isn't just telling you not to hate and to love people, so we exist somewhere in the
[00:39:27.800 --> 00:39:28.800]   middle plane.
[00:39:28.800 --> 00:39:33.040]   But he's saying you are born of love.
[00:39:33.040 --> 00:39:36.880]   That's why it's a similar thing.
[00:39:36.880 --> 00:39:40.080]   He is telling you that this is what someone born of him looks like.
[00:39:40.080 --> 00:39:41.080]   This is a Christian.
[00:39:41.080 --> 00:39:46.560]   So if you think about it, in our fallenness, we are prone to hate people.
[00:39:46.560 --> 00:39:50.200]   But in our salvation, we are instructed and transformed to love others.
[00:39:50.200 --> 00:39:52.920]   And it's gonna be a struggle.
[00:39:52.920 --> 00:39:56.840]   And maybe we would naturally think there's a person here or there that we hate, or you
[00:39:56.840 --> 00:39:59.180]   might even say, "I don't really hate anyone."
[00:39:59.180 --> 00:40:02.600]   You might actually be thinking that right now.
[00:40:02.600 --> 00:40:06.080]   You might just call it frustration against someone or annoyance, and maybe it's just
[00:40:06.080 --> 00:40:07.080]   that.
[00:40:07.080 --> 00:40:10.480]   It could be maybe just a little bit of an annoyance, a little bit of frustration towards
[00:40:10.480 --> 00:40:12.720]   someone, maybe.
[00:40:12.720 --> 00:40:19.720]   But you have to ask the question, "First of all, do I love him?"
[00:40:19.720 --> 00:40:22.720]   Because maybe that's not even the problem.
[00:40:22.720 --> 00:40:24.520]   I don't hate anyone.
[00:40:24.520 --> 00:40:25.520]   So what?
[00:40:25.520 --> 00:40:26.520]   God says love.
[00:40:26.520 --> 00:40:36.440]   Maybe we need to learn to scrutinize and evaluate our own hearts to see how we view people and
[00:40:36.440 --> 00:40:42.280]   see if there are any seeds of sprouting roots of hatred in our hearts.
[00:40:42.280 --> 00:40:46.280]   When you expand the definition of hate, you begin to see the ugliness of what hate is.
[00:40:46.280 --> 00:40:48.240]   Hatred isn't just wanting to hurt someone.
[00:40:48.240 --> 00:40:51.560]   Maybe it's not wanting them in your life.
[00:40:51.560 --> 00:40:52.880]   Maybe it's wanting nothing to do with them.
[00:40:52.880 --> 00:40:56.640]   Maybe it's wishing they didn't exist.
[00:40:56.640 --> 00:41:04.800]   The fact that they are impinging on your world, impinging on your comforts and conveniences,
[00:41:04.800 --> 00:41:06.280]   makes you want them gone.
[00:41:06.280 --> 00:41:13.520]   In sin, what we do is we declare ourselves God, and all these people here are there to
[00:41:13.520 --> 00:41:24.520]   serve me, to pray into my kingdom, my life, my world.
[00:41:24.520 --> 00:41:28.000]   And if someone doesn't fit into our idea of what life should look like, we close them
[00:41:28.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   off.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:31.000]   We shut them out.
[00:41:31.000 --> 00:41:35.560]   And in a way, we hate them.
[00:41:35.560 --> 00:41:41.080]   Hate them because of them, they're an obstacle to something you want.
[00:41:41.080 --> 00:41:48.600]   By the way you treat people, they very well might be people you're hating right now at
[00:41:48.600 --> 00:41:50.800]   church.
[00:41:50.800 --> 00:41:56.560]   So when the time and opportunity comes for you to love them, you will avoid them.
[00:41:56.560 --> 00:42:02.800]   You'll say the superficial, due diligence stuff, and then you'll sidestep and go, "Whew,
[00:42:02.800 --> 00:42:05.440]   got that done."
[00:42:05.440 --> 00:42:07.200]   Go on with comfortable living.
[00:42:07.200 --> 00:42:09.640]   And there's a potential we might be doing that to one another.
[00:42:09.640 --> 00:42:14.320]   Maybe even possibly today we did it.
[00:42:14.320 --> 00:42:17.400]   We can be polite and smile and say, "How was your week?"
[00:42:17.400 --> 00:42:19.400]   And we grow protective though inwardly of ourselves.
[00:42:19.400 --> 00:42:24.960]   Rather than having our hearts stretch and reach out towards others, we grow inward,
[00:42:24.960 --> 00:42:34.240]   and we will interact only with those who can serve some purpose in my own life.
[00:42:34.240 --> 00:42:38.200]   Do you know how you might show hatred to a homeless person?
[00:42:38.200 --> 00:42:41.960]   You roll up the window when you come across them on the freeway, right?
[00:42:41.960 --> 00:42:45.480]   It's not that that's wrong.
[00:42:45.480 --> 00:42:47.280]   You don't make eye contact with the guy.
[00:42:47.280 --> 00:42:50.120]   It's not that that's wrong.
[00:42:50.120 --> 00:42:53.320]   Think about it a little bit.
[00:42:53.320 --> 00:42:59.000]   You sit there, roll up window, don't make eye contact, green light, hurry, hurry, hurry.
[00:42:59.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   You go, "Whew."
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:08.960]   It's an interesting thing.
[00:43:08.960 --> 00:43:11.100]   It's the fact that we don't need to give them money.
[00:43:11.100 --> 00:43:16.280]   We don't need to sit there and think, "How am I going to get out of this car and talk
[00:43:16.280 --> 00:43:17.840]   to them or share the gospel?"
[00:43:17.840 --> 00:43:18.840]   It's not that.
[00:43:18.840 --> 00:43:22.040]   I think the danger is in the middle of the heart.
[00:43:22.040 --> 00:43:26.120]   You close off your life against them.
[00:43:26.120 --> 00:43:27.800]   It's just a rolling up of the window.
[00:43:27.800 --> 00:43:28.800]   Very simple.
[00:43:28.800 --> 00:43:29.800]   We don't do the old style.
[00:43:29.800 --> 00:43:30.800]   It's very simple now.
[00:43:30.800 --> 00:43:36.000]   You just pull up the little automatic, and they're closed out of your life.
[00:43:36.000 --> 00:43:39.500]   That's hatred.
[00:43:39.500 --> 00:43:40.500]   Think about it metaphorically.
[00:43:40.500 --> 00:43:44.600]   Don't we do that with people in our lives?
[00:43:44.600 --> 00:43:46.080]   People we'd rather not deal with?
[00:43:46.080 --> 00:43:48.720]   People that don't have anything to offer us?
[00:43:48.720 --> 00:43:53.720]   Rather than sitting there and thinking, "How can I love them without just kindness?"
[00:43:53.720 --> 00:43:54.720]   But with agape love.
[00:43:54.720 --> 00:43:58.720]   The way God loved me, how can I love the brothers?
[00:43:58.720 --> 00:44:04.660]   How can I love the sisters?
[00:44:04.660 --> 00:44:06.480]   To pursue their good.
[00:44:06.480 --> 00:44:09.160]   To be sacrificial in our love for one another.
[00:44:09.160 --> 00:44:15.080]   To be decisive in our love to say, "I will love them today."
[00:44:15.080 --> 00:44:19.800]   What we do is we kind of go, "Zzzz," and we roll up our heart window.
[00:44:19.800 --> 00:44:23.400]   Maybe even to each other.
[00:44:23.400 --> 00:44:29.120]   We don't make eye contact, and we just hope it passes quickly.
[00:44:29.120 --> 00:44:31.460]   You know how God could have hated us?
[00:44:31.460 --> 00:44:35.880]   He could have just rolled up that window as we went on our way to hell.
[00:44:35.880 --> 00:44:42.320]   He didn't have to go there and hate us.
[00:44:42.320 --> 00:44:43.320]   Just let it happen.
[00:44:43.320 --> 00:44:49.560]   "Go to my wrath."
[00:44:49.560 --> 00:44:50.560]   But he loved us.
[00:44:50.560 --> 00:44:57.040]   God himself came down and interacted with, and dealt with, and embraced sinful men.
[00:44:57.040 --> 00:44:59.680]   Lepers touched Jesus.
[00:44:59.680 --> 00:45:04.480]   Not just simple physical leprosy, but spiritual lepers touched Christ.
[00:45:04.480 --> 00:45:09.160]   He did the exact opposite of ignoring us and hoping and pretending we didn't exist.
[00:45:09.160 --> 00:45:12.120]   He went to the cross.
[00:45:12.120 --> 00:45:13.680]   Hating someone says, "Go away to them."
[00:45:13.680 --> 00:45:15.760]   Hating someone says, "I want you out of my life."
[00:45:15.760 --> 00:45:19.440]   God in his love not only saves us, but he doesn't just say, "I want you out of my life.
[00:45:19.440 --> 00:45:20.880]   You're an inconvenience to me."
[00:45:20.880 --> 00:45:22.360]   He says, "I will die for you.
[00:45:22.360 --> 00:45:23.680]   Come into my kingdom.
[00:45:23.680 --> 00:45:24.680]   Come into my house."
[00:45:24.680 --> 00:45:27.800]   Who does that?
[00:45:27.800 --> 00:45:33.000]   Come into my house.
[00:45:33.000 --> 00:45:38.720]   Take on the inheritance of my very own son.
[00:45:38.720 --> 00:45:40.680]   And so this might be what hate looks like in our lives.
[00:45:40.680 --> 00:45:42.240]   We roll up the window.
[00:45:42.240 --> 00:45:44.320]   The church, we must love one another as God loved us.
[00:45:44.320 --> 00:45:47.040]   Not a love of our own world, but a love from God.
[00:45:47.040 --> 00:45:50.600]   A self-sacrificing, far-reaching love.
[00:45:50.600 --> 00:45:54.120]   This isn't just being inclusive, or nice, or considerate.
[00:45:54.120 --> 00:45:56.480]   It's the way God loves you.
[00:45:56.480 --> 00:45:59.480]   That's how you love each other.
[00:45:59.480 --> 00:46:03.800]   If you say you love God, but hate brothers, it says here in this text, you are a liar.
[00:46:03.800 --> 00:46:07.960]   If you're wondering, "Man, am I hating people?"
[00:46:07.960 --> 00:46:11.920]   And if we're thinking that now, and it says here, if you say you love God, but you hate
[00:46:11.920 --> 00:46:17.000]   your brothers and sisters around you, you are a liar.
[00:46:17.000 --> 00:46:20.040]   First John, I love it and I hate it because it's so black and white.
[00:46:20.040 --> 00:46:21.040]   It makes it hard.
[00:46:21.040 --> 00:46:22.920]   Like, "Am I not a Christian?"
[00:46:22.920 --> 00:46:24.040]   We're not going to go into that.
[00:46:24.040 --> 00:46:31.440]   But the understanding of this is if you are a Christian, you ought to look a certain way.
[00:46:31.440 --> 00:46:35.640]   If you say you love God, but hate your brothers, liar.
[00:46:35.640 --> 00:46:37.640]   You can sing all the song you want.
[00:46:37.640 --> 00:46:41.920]   "Jesus, I am so in love with you."
[00:46:41.920 --> 00:46:47.360]   Maybe God is looking down and saying, "Hmm, sure about that?"
[00:46:47.360 --> 00:46:55.600]   I had to kind of go through my heart again today.
[00:46:55.600 --> 00:46:58.320]   You can serve however much you want.
[00:46:58.320 --> 00:47:02.680]   You can even pick out a few people to say, "Those are the people I'm going to serve."
[00:47:02.680 --> 00:47:03.680]   And so they're like a project.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:08.400]   They're like the ones that we can say, like, we can point to in our own hearts and say,
[00:47:08.400 --> 00:47:10.360]   "See, I am loving people."
[00:47:10.360 --> 00:47:13.640]   And maybe we'll just even pick one person we kind of don't like and say, "No, but we're
[00:47:13.640 --> 00:47:17.160]   to be characterized by love.
[00:47:17.160 --> 00:47:25.000]   Whoever we come across, that's just what happens."
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:31.320]   If you are saying you love God, but you hate brothers, you're a liar.
[00:47:31.320 --> 00:47:34.480]   If you are doing that, you're always going to have a portion of the heart that resides
[00:47:34.480 --> 00:47:35.480]   in darkness.
[00:47:35.480 --> 00:47:37.840]   You're going to have a portion of the heart that you're unwilling to surrender to the
[00:47:37.840 --> 00:47:39.280]   transforming love of God.
[00:47:39.280 --> 00:47:44.040]   You'll have a portion of your heart that you declare yourself as deity over it as you withhold
[00:47:44.040 --> 00:47:46.680]   mercy over somebody.
[00:47:46.680 --> 00:47:50.000]   In Matthew chapter 5 verse 23, that's why it says there, "Therefore, if you are presenting
[00:47:50.000 --> 00:47:53.920]   your offering at the altar," and hopefully that's an act of love for God, an act of worship
[00:47:53.920 --> 00:47:56.080]   before God.
[00:47:56.080 --> 00:47:58.440]   Presenting your offering at the altar and there remember that your brother has something
[00:47:58.440 --> 00:47:59.440]   against you.
[00:47:59.440 --> 00:48:01.200]   Leave your offering there before the altar and go.
[00:48:01.200 --> 00:48:03.880]   Help you reconcile to your brother and then come and present your offering.
[00:48:03.880 --> 00:48:09.760]   The idea of that is kind of what we're seeing here in this text.
[00:48:09.760 --> 00:48:13.320]   There's a statement, it's called a fortiori statement.
[00:48:13.320 --> 00:48:14.320]   I learned of it in seminary.
[00:48:14.320 --> 00:48:15.840]   I thought it was kind of a cool thing.
[00:48:15.840 --> 00:48:17.960]   It literally means by a stronger argument.
[00:48:17.960 --> 00:48:22.320]   What you see in verse 20 and 21 is a fortiori statement.
[00:48:22.320 --> 00:48:27.320]   It's that if you can't do the lesser, you cannot, the greater is not true in your life.
[00:48:27.320 --> 00:48:28.320]   That's what it says there, right?
[00:48:28.320 --> 00:48:31.360]   It says, "If anyone says, 'I love God' and hates his brother, he is a liar.
[00:48:31.360 --> 00:48:34.880]   For the one who does not love his brother whom he has seen cannot love God whom he has
[00:48:34.880 --> 00:48:35.880]   seen."
[00:48:35.880 --> 00:48:36.880]   Oh, I keep flipping those, huh?
[00:48:36.880 --> 00:48:42.760]   "Who does not love his brother who he has seen cannot love God whom he has not seen."
[00:48:42.760 --> 00:48:45.360]   In Matthew chapter 7 verse 11, I'll just give you one example of it.
[00:48:45.360 --> 00:48:48.520]   "If you there being evil know how to give good gifts to your children, how much more
[00:48:48.520 --> 00:48:54.200]   will your Father who is in heaven give what is good to those who ask?"
[00:48:54.200 --> 00:48:58.600]   The reality of this passage is it's more difficult to love someone you can't see, God, than it
[00:48:58.600 --> 00:49:02.760]   is to love someone you can, your brothers.
[00:49:02.760 --> 00:49:05.800]   You can't love God if you're hating other people.
[00:49:05.800 --> 00:49:07.720]   It cannot exist at the same time.
[00:49:07.720 --> 00:49:15.440]   If we're not characterized by a love for people, we can't deceive ourselves in saying we're
[00:49:15.440 --> 00:49:16.440]   loving God.
[00:49:16.440 --> 00:49:22.800]   We could easily be today setting up a kingdom where we close ourselves up and we're building
[00:49:22.800 --> 00:49:30.400]   up our own kingdom, a Christianity, a church that's just some scary styrofoam castle in
[00:49:30.400 --> 00:49:31.400]   our lives.
[00:49:31.400 --> 00:49:36.680]   We're playing a church game and there's no real agape love happening here.
[00:49:36.680 --> 00:49:40.720]   We go past that, there's those three things in the bathroom all the time.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:41.960]   In my mind, I thought it was so funny.
[00:49:41.960 --> 00:49:45.280]   It's like we engage in God-centered worship and we equip believers with God words and
[00:49:45.280 --> 00:49:47.480]   then I take a bathroom break.
[00:49:47.480 --> 00:49:49.040]   Then we get stuck there.
[00:49:49.040 --> 00:49:50.040]   That's what we do.
[00:49:50.040 --> 00:49:53.040]   We're here to worship God.
[00:49:53.040 --> 00:49:57.960]   But the third one, building Christ-centered community and love and accountability, really
[00:49:57.960 --> 00:50:03.560]   loving each other with almost that same affection that we have for God.
[00:50:03.560 --> 00:50:10.600]   It's kind of there for people.
[00:50:10.600 --> 00:50:17.600]   So we'll do our meetups, we'll do our meals, but are we on our knees for each other?
[00:50:17.600 --> 00:50:18.600]   Are we praying?
[00:50:18.600 --> 00:50:21.400]   Are we asking each other deeper questions?
[00:50:21.400 --> 00:50:26.880]   Not because you know that's the right thing to do, but because you care deeply for them.
[00:50:26.880 --> 00:50:30.920]   You're not satisfied with when they say like, "Yeah, we're good.
[00:50:30.920 --> 00:50:35.400]   Same old, same old."
[00:50:35.400 --> 00:50:37.880]   Are you concerned for the spiritual health of one another?
[00:50:37.880 --> 00:50:38.880]   Are we sharing our struggles?
[00:50:38.880 --> 00:50:45.240]   When we look at each other, do we see how that person fits into my life?
[00:50:45.240 --> 00:50:48.040]   What they can add to my life?
[00:50:48.040 --> 00:50:52.840]   Or do we have a deep concern for them?
[00:50:52.840 --> 00:50:56.640]   So it says in verse 21, "And this commandment we have from him, that the one who loves God
[00:50:56.640 --> 00:51:01.240]   should love his brother also."
[00:51:01.240 --> 00:51:05.400]   We do this by laying down our lives for each other.
[00:51:05.400 --> 00:51:09.240]   Mind you, it's not just doing nice things or serving each other per se.
[00:51:09.240 --> 00:51:11.120]   It's laying down your lives.
[00:51:11.120 --> 00:51:16.240]   In 1 John 3 verse 16, "We know love by this, that he laid down his life for us, and we
[00:51:16.240 --> 00:51:18.480]   ought also to lay down our lives for the brethren."
[00:51:18.480 --> 00:51:23.240]   So this example of Christ laying down his life for us, and then that same word, "laying
[00:51:23.240 --> 00:51:29.400]   down life," placed upon us, says, "You love others like that."
[00:51:29.400 --> 00:51:33.640]   John 15, 13, "Greater love has no one than this, that one lay down his life for his friends."
[00:51:33.640 --> 00:51:36.760]   I had a whole thing of application.
[00:51:36.760 --> 00:51:39.880]   We could just shoot it up, and I'm not gonna go through any of these.
[00:51:39.880 --> 00:51:40.880]   These are just...
[00:51:40.880 --> 00:51:43.520]   We were supposed to, but we're gonna run out of time.
[00:51:43.520 --> 00:51:45.200]   So I wanna remind you of who John was.
[00:51:45.200 --> 00:51:48.280]   The author of this book, to close here.
[00:51:48.280 --> 00:51:51.920]   He was someone called the Son of Thunder, along with James.
[00:51:51.920 --> 00:51:57.040]   And remember, Jesus, he names them that in Mark 3.
[00:51:57.040 --> 00:52:01.240]   And the reason for that was because they were just reckless and really like...
[00:52:01.240 --> 00:52:04.120]   You know those people who are kind of meatheads?
[00:52:04.120 --> 00:52:08.960]   I feel like they're kind of those kind of guys that just wants like, "Hey, let's go.
[00:52:08.960 --> 00:52:11.240]   Jesus, they did this to you, so rain...
[00:52:11.240 --> 00:52:15.680]   You want us to pray and it's gonna rain down fire upon them?"
[00:52:15.680 --> 00:52:18.480]   Very graceless type of people almost.
[00:52:18.480 --> 00:52:25.840]   This was someone brash and rash, judgmental maybe, but even someone like this, he becomes
[00:52:25.840 --> 00:52:29.840]   someone who's known as the apostle of love.
[00:52:29.840 --> 00:52:32.600]   It was as he grew and matured in Christ.
[00:52:32.600 --> 00:52:36.560]   Remember, we are called to love because God first loved us, and love is not something
[00:52:36.560 --> 00:52:41.200]   that we can muster up with our own strength.
[00:52:41.200 --> 00:52:42.840]   It's not sheer human exertion.
[00:52:42.840 --> 00:52:48.040]   It's something that supernaturally happens as we ponder and meditate and deepen in our
[00:52:48.040 --> 00:52:50.640]   understanding of God's love for us.
[00:52:50.640 --> 00:52:53.040]   It's the only way.
[00:52:53.040 --> 00:52:57.840]   And so this is maybe my plea, my exhortation to us as a church.
[00:52:57.840 --> 00:53:01.120]   Can we love one another?
[00:53:01.120 --> 00:53:03.400]   So simple to say that, love one another.
[00:53:03.400 --> 00:53:07.700]   But can we truly love one another?
[00:53:07.700 --> 00:53:13.480]   Because this unity is vital in carrying out the mission that the church is called to.
[00:53:13.480 --> 00:53:17.500]   This isn't something nice to have on top of what we do as a church.
[00:53:17.500 --> 00:53:21.160]   How we love each other is going to be the proof of whether or not we truly love God
[00:53:21.160 --> 00:53:24.060]   and understand his love for us.
[00:53:24.060 --> 00:53:26.280]   This is not something to sweep under the rug.
[00:53:26.280 --> 00:53:30.160]   If we just superficially continue our interactions with each other without deeply loving each
[00:53:30.160 --> 00:53:35.040]   other, there is no true unity in the spirit and it's just a matter of time before Berean
[00:53:35.040 --> 00:53:38.080]   crumbles.
[00:53:38.080 --> 00:53:41.340]   We will not be able to stand together in a world that's looking for every reason to tear
[00:53:41.340 --> 00:53:44.080]   us down.
[00:53:44.080 --> 00:53:47.000]   We ought not to be looking at others to see why others aren't loving me.
[00:53:47.000 --> 00:53:52.280]   The call is for us to go and love others.
[00:53:52.280 --> 00:53:58.280]   Challenged by God's call on my life to go and do that.
[00:53:58.280 --> 00:54:02.500]   This is not duty, this is now desire.
[00:54:02.500 --> 00:54:05.760]   This is not a church game, this is who we are.
[00:54:05.760 --> 00:54:08.080]   This is our identity.
[00:54:08.080 --> 00:54:13.000]   The stakes are high because God will empower us to love each other.
[00:54:13.000 --> 00:54:18.000]   As we deepen in our understanding of his love for us, the stakes are going to be like will
[00:54:18.000 --> 00:54:23.200]   you answer the call of what it is to be a believer.
[00:54:23.200 --> 00:54:26.520]   So would you take a moment to pray?
[00:54:26.520 --> 00:54:35.200]   Then after a moment our praise team will come and lead us in some songs of response.
