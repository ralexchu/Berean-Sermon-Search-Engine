[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:09.520]   As you guys know, we had a very busy week this week, starting from Palm Sunday.
[00:00:09.520 --> 00:00:16.060]   We were walking through the last day of Jesus' life on earth before he goes to the cross.
[00:00:16.060 --> 00:00:17.960]   And Monday we gathered together.
[00:00:17.960 --> 00:00:23.840]   We went through devotions of what Jesus did, cleansing the temple and cursing the fig tree.
[00:00:23.840 --> 00:00:28.480]   Tuesday we got together and we ran through what Jesus was teaching, the condemnation
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:34.000]   of the leaders of Israel, and a warning and giving hope to the disciples about his second
[00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:35.000]   coming.
[00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:44.120]   Thursday, Wednesday, we talked about the betrayal and the preparation for Judas to betray Christ.
[00:00:44.120 --> 00:00:46.960]   Thursday we had communion.
[00:00:46.960 --> 00:00:52.280]   The Passover meal was celebrated to prepare us for what happened on Friday morning when
[00:00:52.280 --> 00:00:54.320]   Jesus was crucified.
[00:00:54.320 --> 00:00:56.480]   And so we got together on Friday night.
[00:00:56.480 --> 00:01:01.480]   Early this morning we had the early rise service together and now we'll continue in our service
[00:01:01.480 --> 00:01:04.000]   of celebrating his resurrection.
[00:01:04.000 --> 00:01:05.720]   This is not unique to us.
[00:01:05.720 --> 00:01:10.480]   All throughout the world this morning, in different time zones, all the believers in
[00:01:10.480 --> 00:01:15.480]   Christ in various denominations have gathered together and are continuing to gather together
[00:01:15.480 --> 00:01:18.120]   to celebrate this special day.
[00:01:18.120 --> 00:01:23.960]   Every Sunday is important, but especially this Sunday, because our faith rises and falls
[00:01:23.960 --> 00:01:29.640]   based on the validity of the historical resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[00:01:29.640 --> 00:01:31.320]   And this is not just us saying this.
[00:01:31.320 --> 00:01:33.760]   The Bible itself says that.
[00:01:33.760 --> 00:01:37.920]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 17, 19 it says, "And if Christ has not been raised, your faith
[00:01:37.920 --> 00:01:39.720]   is worthless.
[00:01:39.720 --> 00:01:44.920]   You are still in your sins, and those also who have fallen asleep in Christ have perished.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.040]   If we have hoped in Christ in this life only, we are all men most to be pitied."
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:52.160]   Again, this is coming straight from the Bible.
[00:01:52.160 --> 00:01:58.080]   If somehow you're able to emphatically disprove that the resurrection did not take place,
[00:01:58.080 --> 00:02:00.600]   he says we are to be pitied.
[00:02:00.600 --> 00:02:03.880]   Our faith is completely worthless.
[00:02:03.880 --> 00:02:05.740]   This is all a hoax.
[00:02:05.740 --> 00:02:10.220]   You know, we'd be very concerned if a family member came back and said that they joined
[00:02:10.220 --> 00:02:14.620]   some cult and they're making these requirements on their life and we would do everything in
[00:02:14.620 --> 00:02:17.840]   our power to try to thwart them from that.
[00:02:17.840 --> 00:02:20.900]   If the resurrection didn't take place, we're nothing but a cult.
[00:02:20.900 --> 00:02:23.720]   We just have greater influence.
[00:02:23.720 --> 00:02:26.700]   It just means it's bigger.
[00:02:26.700 --> 00:02:30.580]   But if the resurrection did happen, what does that mean?
[00:02:30.580 --> 00:02:37.900]   This morning, my goal is not to exposit and to give you an apologetics information about
[00:02:37.900 --> 00:02:41.920]   the proof of the resurrection historically.
[00:02:41.920 --> 00:02:47.420]   If you are interested, we have maybe about 15 of these books, "Who Moved the Stone?"
[00:02:47.420 --> 00:02:54.260]   And it kind of gives a journalistic perspective of digging through the proof of the resurrection,
[00:02:54.260 --> 00:03:00.720]   why it is reasonable to believe that Jesus was actually resurrected from the dead.
[00:03:00.720 --> 00:03:01.780]   And so we have 15 of these.
[00:03:01.780 --> 00:03:05.800]   So after the service, if you are interested in getting one of these, the first 15 that
[00:03:05.800 --> 00:03:13.780]   runs over there and gets it, okay, let's see who's really hungry for God and let's see
[00:03:13.780 --> 00:03:17.400]   who is going to beat the other person there.
[00:03:17.400 --> 00:03:18.400]   So 15.
[00:03:18.400 --> 00:03:23.420]   So after the service, there is a table that's set up there from the outreach team, and they
[00:03:23.420 --> 00:03:28.400]   have another book that they're going to give you about the gospel, and it gives a clear
[00:03:28.400 --> 00:03:30.500]   presentation of the gospel along with this book.
[00:03:30.500 --> 00:03:32.900]   Again, this one, we have a limited copy.
[00:03:32.900 --> 00:03:35.140]   So if you get out there first, they'll give you one.
[00:03:35.140 --> 00:03:40.640]   And Pastor Mark and our outreach team will be out there, and they'll be explaining.
[00:03:40.640 --> 00:03:44.860]   If you have any questions, if you come here because a friend or family member has invited
[00:03:44.860 --> 00:03:49.940]   you and you have some questions to ask, Pastor Mark and the team will be able to give you
[00:03:49.940 --> 00:03:53.580]   a brief presentation and then answer any kind of questions that you have.
[00:03:53.580 --> 00:03:54.580]   Okay?
[00:03:54.580 --> 00:03:55.580]   So that's going to be at the table.
[00:03:55.580 --> 00:04:02.260]   But this morning, my goal is not to get into the information in this book, but to take
[00:04:02.260 --> 00:04:08.220]   some time to walk through John chapter 11, because the foreshadowing of why Jesus had
[00:04:08.220 --> 00:04:13.660]   to die and be resurrected is stated clearly in this text in John chapter 11.
[00:04:13.660 --> 00:04:17.860]   This event takes place a few days before he actually gets into Jerusalem.
[00:04:17.860 --> 00:04:23.400]   And so what he does with the raising of Lazarus, he spells out that this is the reason why
[00:04:23.400 --> 00:04:24.780]   he came.
[00:04:24.780 --> 00:04:28.940]   So let me pray for us, and then we'll jump into the text afterwards.
[00:04:28.940 --> 00:04:36.700]   Heavenly Father, we pray for the anointing of your Holy Spirit that we may more than
[00:04:36.700 --> 00:04:44.480]   just understand the facts, but that your Spirit would illumine us, that we may see a greater
[00:04:44.480 --> 00:04:48.940]   glimpse of the glory of the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:04:48.940 --> 00:04:54.100]   That as the scripture says, "All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God," that
[00:04:54.100 --> 00:04:59.180]   that glory may be restored, that we may be able to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:04:59.180 --> 00:05:01.500]   So we pray for your anointing and your Spirit's power.
[00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:03.460]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:05:03.460 --> 00:05:04.500]   Amen.
[00:05:04.500 --> 00:05:10.300]   So let's begin in John chapter 11 verse 1, which kind of sets up the background behind
[00:05:10.300 --> 00:05:12.380]   the story of his resurrection.
[00:05:12.380 --> 00:05:15.980]   It says, "Now a certain man was sick, Lazarus of Bethany."
[00:05:15.980 --> 00:05:18.580]   Bethany is about two miles away from Jerusalem.
[00:05:18.580 --> 00:05:25.420]   And he says, "Lazarus was sick, the village of Mary and her sister Martha.
[00:05:25.420 --> 00:05:30.000]   It was Mary who anointed the Lord with ointment and wiped his feet with her hair, whose brother
[00:05:30.000 --> 00:05:31.060]   Lazarus was sick.
[00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:35.940]   So the sisters sent word to him, saying, 'Lord, behold, he whom you love is sick.'"
[00:05:35.940 --> 00:05:40.140]   So first and foremost, the background that is set up before here is that this is not
[00:05:40.140 --> 00:05:41.580]   just any family.
[00:05:41.580 --> 00:05:46.300]   Lazarus, Mary, and Martha are very prominent figures in the New Testament.
[00:05:46.300 --> 00:05:53.120]   Martha, if you remember in Luke chapter 10, is the one who is running around and trying
[00:05:53.120 --> 00:05:55.200]   to take care of things.
[00:05:55.200 --> 00:06:02.520]   And Mary is the one in John chapter 12 who anoints Jesus' feet with the oil and wipes
[00:06:02.520 --> 00:06:08.240]   it off with her own hair, which would have been a humiliating act for a woman to do for
[00:06:08.240 --> 00:06:09.640]   anybody.
[00:06:09.640 --> 00:06:14.800]   But she is known for that, not knowing that possibly that she is anointing him for his
[00:06:14.800 --> 00:06:15.800]   death.
[00:06:15.800 --> 00:06:21.400]   So it repeats several times that Jesus loved this family.
[00:06:21.400 --> 00:06:22.920]   So that's the background setting.
[00:06:22.920 --> 00:06:28.600]   So Jesus, obviously, was very gracious and generous and he healed many people, but in
[00:06:28.600 --> 00:06:32.500]   particular here he said this is a family that he loved, had an intimate relationship and
[00:06:32.500 --> 00:06:35.200]   knowledge about.
[00:06:35.200 --> 00:06:40.440]   It says in verse 4, "But when Jesus heard this, he said, 'This sickness is not to end
[00:06:40.440 --> 00:06:46.180]   in death, but for the glory of God, so that the Son of God may be glorified by it.'"
[00:06:46.180 --> 00:06:50.520]   Now again, I want to highlight that Jesus is not surprised by this news.
[00:06:50.520 --> 00:06:55.320]   You would think that if they said that this is a family that he loves, Mary, Martha, and
[00:06:55.320 --> 00:06:57.400]   Lazarus, and he's sick.
[00:06:57.400 --> 00:07:00.520]   Now they didn't just come to him because he was sick and had a cold.
[00:07:00.520 --> 00:07:05.760]   Where Jesus was on the other side of Jordan would have been at least one day's journey,
[00:07:05.760 --> 00:07:10.720]   which means that the people who came to tell Jesus about Lazarus' sickness thought that
[00:07:10.720 --> 00:07:15.920]   this was serious enough that they would have to travel a whole day's journey just to tell
[00:07:15.920 --> 00:07:16.920]   him to get him to come.
[00:07:16.920 --> 00:07:19.280]   These are the ones you love.
[00:07:19.280 --> 00:07:23.400]   Thinking that if you tell him it's Lazarus, it's Mary and Martha's brother, that he would
[00:07:23.400 --> 00:07:24.840]   quickly come.
[00:07:24.840 --> 00:07:28.120]   But Jesus' response here is he is not surprised.
[00:07:28.120 --> 00:07:31.580]   In fact, he says this is ordained by God.
[00:07:31.580 --> 00:07:35.080]   This is not going to end in death, but for God's glory.
[00:07:35.080 --> 00:07:37.040]   So keep that in mind.
[00:07:37.040 --> 00:07:39.760]   Jesus is not shocked, he's not surprised, he doesn't react.
[00:07:39.760 --> 00:07:42.240]   He says this is God ordained and he calms them down.
[00:07:42.240 --> 00:07:47.200]   And in verse 5, and I want you to pay very close attention to what he says in verse 5
[00:07:47.200 --> 00:07:53.160]   and 6, because if you don't dissect this passage, you're going to miss a huge part of what's
[00:07:53.160 --> 00:07:54.320]   going on here.
[00:07:54.320 --> 00:08:01.240]   Verse 5, "Now Jesus loved Martha and her sister and Lazarus, so when he heard that he was
[00:08:01.240 --> 00:08:06.280]   sick, he then stayed two days longer in the place where he was."
[00:08:06.280 --> 00:08:08.520]   Did you catch that?
[00:08:08.520 --> 00:08:11.000]   What's wrong with this text?
[00:08:11.000 --> 00:08:17.960]   He says, it emphasizes that he loved Martha, her sister, Lazarus.
[00:08:17.960 --> 00:08:20.800]   This is the second time this is mentioned.
[00:08:20.800 --> 00:08:28.720]   But he doesn't say, but rather, instead of jumping, he says, "because he loved them,"
[00:08:28.720 --> 00:08:29.720]   what does he say?
[00:08:29.720 --> 00:08:33.680]   "So when he heard that he was sick, he then stayed two days longer in the place where
[00:08:33.680 --> 00:08:34.680]   he was."
[00:08:34.680 --> 00:08:40.320]   So you would think that if there's an emphasis that Jesus really loved them, so that you
[00:08:40.320 --> 00:08:44.960]   would think he got up, quickly packed up his bag, whatever he was doing, he dropped and
[00:08:44.960 --> 00:08:46.160]   he ran over there.
[00:08:46.160 --> 00:08:50.800]   That's what you would think would happen, especially after emphasizing how close they
[00:08:50.800 --> 00:08:52.880]   were to Jesus.
[00:08:52.880 --> 00:09:00.240]   But he says he loved them, and because he loved them, he says, he stayed two more days.
[00:09:00.240 --> 00:09:05.000]   In other words, just like he said in the previous word, this is God ordained.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:10.120]   He's allowing them to experience this death.
[00:09:10.120 --> 00:09:17.780]   Our natural inclination is to think that when hardship and difficulty comes, that maybe
[00:09:17.780 --> 00:09:20.840]   we did something wrong.
[00:09:20.840 --> 00:09:25.320]   I remember as a young Christian, when I first became a Christian, even when I stubbed my
[00:09:25.320 --> 00:09:31.240]   toe, my first thought was, what did I do wrong?
[00:09:31.240 --> 00:09:33.620]   I remember doing that.
[00:09:33.620 --> 00:09:39.200]   Something would happen, or I'd get a flat tire, or I'd get pulled over by the police,
[00:09:39.200 --> 00:09:42.280]   because of my exemplary driving.
[00:09:42.280 --> 00:09:46.780]   The first thought was, did I not do quiet time today?
[00:09:46.780 --> 00:09:48.200]   Maybe I should have evangelized yesterday.
[00:09:48.200 --> 00:09:50.840]   That's the first thought that I had.
[00:09:50.840 --> 00:09:54.840]   How many of you, when you are stuck in a situation, or sadness, or difficulty, or something seems
[00:09:54.840 --> 00:10:02.800]   to go wrong, the first thought that comes to your mind, maybe, am I not living obedient?
[00:10:02.800 --> 00:10:05.320]   Maybe I shouldn't have been so stingy.
[00:10:05.320 --> 00:10:06.320]   Maybe I should have done this.
[00:10:06.320 --> 00:10:08.260]   Maybe if I didn't sin here.
[00:10:08.260 --> 00:10:15.360]   But here it says, He allowed them to experience this pain, this sorrow, this death.
[00:10:15.360 --> 00:10:19.540]   He says, because He loved them.
[00:10:19.540 --> 00:10:20.800]   Because He loved them.
[00:10:20.800 --> 00:10:24.200]   Not despite, but because.
[00:10:24.200 --> 00:10:25.620]   You remember Job?
[00:10:25.620 --> 00:10:28.560]   When you study the book of Job, we study the suffering.
[00:10:28.560 --> 00:10:33.100]   Typically, whenever somebody wants to give a sermon about suffering, we go into the book
[00:10:33.100 --> 00:10:40.840]   of Job, because this man has suffered more than any average person would understand.
[00:10:40.840 --> 00:10:43.640]   But do you remember why he suffered?
[00:10:43.640 --> 00:10:49.440]   Because in the book of Job, the beginning starts by saying, here's this righteous man.
[00:10:49.440 --> 00:10:55.320]   That you survey all the land, and this righteous man stands out among all the others.
[00:10:55.320 --> 00:10:59.200]   And because of his righteousness, he gets targeted.
[00:10:59.200 --> 00:11:03.680]   In other words, it's because God loved him.
[00:11:03.680 --> 00:11:07.000]   Because of the love of God, he got targeted, and he experienced all the suffering in his
[00:11:07.000 --> 00:11:08.720]   life.
[00:11:08.720 --> 00:11:14.960]   We have a natural tendency to think that when something goes wrong, that if we, maybe the
[00:11:14.960 --> 00:11:18.320]   circumstance can be fixed, if we do this, if I pray hard enough, we can come out of
[00:11:18.320 --> 00:11:26.300]   here not realizing that sometimes God leads us into hardship because He loves us.
[00:11:26.300 --> 00:11:29.920]   That hardship may be there because He loves us.
[00:11:29.920 --> 00:11:36.060]   You see, in verse 7, it says, "Then after this, He said to His disciples, 'Let us go
[00:11:36.060 --> 00:11:37.060]   to Judea again.'
[00:11:37.060 --> 00:11:42.180]   The disciples said to Him, 'Rabbi, the Jews were just now seeking to stone you.
[00:11:42.180 --> 00:11:43.980]   And are you going there again?'
[00:11:43.980 --> 00:11:46.540]   Jesus answered, 'Are there not twelve hours in a day?
[00:11:46.540 --> 00:11:51.220]   If anyone walks in a day, he does not stumble, because he sees the light of this world.
[00:11:51.220 --> 00:11:56.580]   But if anyone walks in the light, he stumbles, because the light is not in him.'"
[00:11:56.580 --> 00:11:59.540]   So let's dissect this passage again.
[00:11:59.540 --> 00:12:05.760]   They're concerned because right before in chapter 10, the Jews were ready to kill him.
[00:12:05.760 --> 00:12:11.340]   And the epicenter of where their power is, is near that area.
[00:12:11.340 --> 00:12:16.180]   And if we go to Judea, if we go to where they are, you're making yourself an easy target.
[00:12:16.180 --> 00:12:19.580]   So if we go there, they're going to harm us.
[00:12:19.580 --> 00:12:22.460]   And Jesus says, "Well, if you walk in the light, there's twelve hours in a day.
[00:12:22.460 --> 00:12:25.220]   If anyone walks in the light, you're not going to stumble."
[00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:27.780]   Now what does He mean by that?
[00:12:27.780 --> 00:12:31.460]   Was He telling His disciples that, "Don't worry, you're not going to get harmed"?
[00:12:31.460 --> 00:12:33.900]   Is that what He's saying?
[00:12:33.900 --> 00:12:40.740]   Remember, Jesus kept on repeatedly telling His disciples that He was going to get harmed.
[00:12:40.740 --> 00:12:44.220]   That He said, "If we go to that area, He's going to get captured.
[00:12:44.220 --> 00:12:45.940]   He's going to get beaten.
[00:12:45.940 --> 00:12:49.140]   And then He's going to be tortured and crucified on the cross."
[00:12:49.140 --> 00:12:51.460]   He told them repeatedly to prepare them.
[00:12:51.460 --> 00:12:54.740]   So when He says here, "If we go to that area, you're not going to stumble."
[00:12:54.740 --> 00:12:56.740]   What does He mean?
[00:12:56.740 --> 00:13:05.920]   It means that if you walk in the light, even if hardship comes, you don't need to worry.
[00:13:05.920 --> 00:13:08.680]   Even if the storm comes, you don't need to worry.
[00:13:08.680 --> 00:13:13.260]   As long as you are walking with Me, as long as you are in the light, I have you.
[00:13:13.260 --> 00:13:15.020]   That's what He means.
[00:13:15.020 --> 00:13:20.540]   Whether you live or die, whether you suffer, whether it ends in illness or whatever may
[00:13:20.540 --> 00:13:24.860]   happen, as long as you're in the light, you're good.
[00:13:24.860 --> 00:13:31.620]   Our natural tendency is to think if we're sick and God heals us, praise God.
[00:13:31.620 --> 00:13:37.260]   If we have financial problems and finances appear, God is blessing us.
[00:13:37.260 --> 00:13:42.500]   So our natural instinct is when the storm comes to look for the calm.
[00:13:42.500 --> 00:13:48.740]   But sometimes when we anchor in Christ, it is right in the middle of the storm.
[00:13:48.740 --> 00:13:54.540]   Our tendency is to look for the calm waters and to run to the calm waters, not knowing
[00:13:54.540 --> 00:14:00.060]   that the calm waters may take you deeper into the ocean where you may die.
[00:14:00.060 --> 00:14:02.500]   Let me give you another illustration.
[00:14:02.500 --> 00:14:05.500]   Let me use Disneyland for it.
[00:14:05.500 --> 00:14:07.860]   You guys know how much I love Disneyland.
[00:14:07.860 --> 00:14:11.900]   Let's say as an example, if you're in Disneyland and several million people have gathered,
[00:14:11.900 --> 00:14:14.980]   which is what it feels like when you go in there, right?
[00:14:14.980 --> 00:14:20.140]   And something happens and all of a sudden there's an emergency and you hear a gunshot,
[00:14:20.140 --> 00:14:21.140]   right?
[00:14:21.140 --> 00:14:25.260]   And you're preparing your children for chaos to come.
[00:14:25.260 --> 00:14:29.140]   Would you tell your children, those of you who raise young children or right now you
[00:14:29.140 --> 00:14:32.900]   have young children with you and you go to Disneyland, and if that happens, do you tell
[00:14:32.900 --> 00:14:38.500]   them look for the quick exit and run?
[00:14:38.500 --> 00:14:40.620]   Is that what you would tell them?
[00:14:40.620 --> 00:14:41.620]   You would not tell them that.
[00:14:41.620 --> 00:14:43.220]   What would you tell them?
[00:14:43.220 --> 00:14:47.340]   You grab my hand and do not let go.
[00:14:47.340 --> 00:14:48.900]   That's what you would tell them.
[00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:54.500]   And you do exactly what I tell you to do, especially when there is chaos.
[00:14:54.500 --> 00:15:00.100]   Because in their natural instinct to survive, they may run toward danger.
[00:15:00.100 --> 00:15:03.460]   They may get themselves into real trouble.
[00:15:03.460 --> 00:15:09.100]   So especially when the storm comes, especially when trouble comes, you say, you stick with
[00:15:09.100 --> 00:15:10.400]   me.
[00:15:10.400 --> 00:15:14.940]   You come and grab my hands and do not let go until I lead you out.
[00:15:14.940 --> 00:15:20.100]   See, Jesus is telling his disciples that storm is coming.
[00:15:20.100 --> 00:15:21.100]   Difficulty is coming.
[00:15:21.100 --> 00:15:22.420]   I told you this.
[00:15:22.420 --> 00:15:24.060]   They're going to capture me.
[00:15:24.060 --> 00:15:26.980]   They're going to crucify me and you guys are going to all scatter and they're going to
[00:15:26.980 --> 00:15:28.220]   come after you too.
[00:15:28.220 --> 00:15:33.580]   But as long as you are in the light, don't worry.
[00:15:33.580 --> 00:15:40.360]   Our natural tendency is to think that if we go toward calm waters, we're safe.
[00:15:40.360 --> 00:15:45.100]   If we're sad, we change the circumstance that makes us happy.
[00:15:45.100 --> 00:15:50.560]   If we're ill, God is blessing us when we are healthy.
[00:15:50.560 --> 00:15:53.400]   But here it says he's leading them into this.
[00:15:53.400 --> 00:15:59.040]   He stays two days longer for that purpose because he had a reason.
[00:15:59.040 --> 00:16:04.440]   In verse 11 he says, "This he said, and after he said this to them, 'Our friend Lazarus
[00:16:04.440 --> 00:16:09.400]   has fallen asleep, but I go so that I may awaken him out of sleep.'"
[00:16:09.400 --> 00:16:14.420]   Now again, you know, the disciples, if you guys know who Three Stooges is, right?
[00:16:14.420 --> 00:16:15.600]   You guys know who Three Stooges is?
[00:16:15.600 --> 00:16:17.640]   I know some of you guys do.
[00:16:17.640 --> 00:16:22.680]   The disciples sometimes look like Three Stooges, right?
[00:16:22.680 --> 00:16:27.600]   And Peter is Mo, he's the leader of the three, right?
[00:16:27.600 --> 00:16:31.320]   Okay, those guys who don't know who Three Stooges is, it's completely going over your
[00:16:31.320 --> 00:16:34.600]   head, right?
[00:16:34.600 --> 00:16:39.200]   One of the reasons why Chuck Colson, again, another person you may or may not know, he
[00:16:39.200 --> 00:16:43.320]   was one of my favorite authors when I was younger, and he said the reason why he came
[00:16:43.320 --> 00:16:49.200]   to faith was because as he was studying the Bible, so much of the resurrection and the
[00:16:49.200 --> 00:16:54.200]   account in the gospels makes the disciples look like fools.
[00:16:54.200 --> 00:16:58.760]   And some people say that I can't believe the Bible because the disciples basically made
[00:16:58.760 --> 00:17:01.680]   this story up so that they can benefit from this story.
[00:17:01.680 --> 00:17:07.000]   And he said, after reading the account, he said, if that was their purpose, they did
[00:17:07.000 --> 00:17:12.640]   a really poor job because in every account, they look like a bunch of fools.
[00:17:12.640 --> 00:17:18.160]   Not only did they not believe him, when Jesus was resurrected, they didn't even go to check.
[00:17:18.160 --> 00:17:21.880]   And when the ladies went to check and they came back and told, they said, "I can't believe
[00:17:21.880 --> 00:17:23.420]   you."
[00:17:23.420 --> 00:17:26.760]   And this is all written down.
[00:17:26.760 --> 00:17:29.520]   The disciples didn't understand what Jesus was saying.
[00:17:29.520 --> 00:17:30.520]   He fell asleep.
[00:17:30.520 --> 00:17:36.280]   In verse 12, the disciple then said to him, "Lord, if he has fallen asleep, he will recover."
[00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:43.680]   Now Jesus had spoken of his death, but they thought he was speaking of literal sleep.
[00:17:43.680 --> 00:17:47.200]   So Jesus then said to them plainly, "Lazarus is dead."
[00:17:47.200 --> 00:17:49.920]   Because they weren't getting it.
[00:17:49.920 --> 00:17:51.520]   You know what I mean?
[00:17:51.520 --> 00:17:55.800]   In our account, it just writes it very plainly, right?
[00:17:55.800 --> 00:18:01.600]   But you can imagine, Jesus probably just didn't say, "He's dead."
[00:18:01.600 --> 00:18:03.200]   My guess is that they thought he was asleep.
[00:18:03.200 --> 00:18:05.760]   Well, if he's asleep, he's going to awake, so don't worry about it.
[00:18:05.760 --> 00:18:14.920]   And you can imagine Jesus going, "Ugh, he's dead."
[00:18:14.920 --> 00:18:20.560]   I mean, they just, they're listening, but they're not understanding through this whole
[00:18:20.560 --> 00:18:21.560]   process.
[00:18:21.560 --> 00:18:27.240]   But Jesus makes it very clear, verse 15, "I am glad for your sake that I was not there,
[00:18:27.240 --> 00:18:29.800]   so that you may believe.
[00:18:29.800 --> 00:18:31.320]   Let us go to him."
[00:18:31.320 --> 00:18:36.160]   Now that's the first and the most clearest reason that he gives how and why this is happening,
[00:18:36.160 --> 00:18:39.540]   is so that you may believe.
[00:18:39.540 --> 00:18:47.600]   Now as Christians, the greatest asset that you and I have is not our wealth, is not our
[00:18:47.600 --> 00:18:56.560]   families, is not our health, is not the citizenship in the United States, is not the ability to
[00:18:56.560 --> 00:18:59.040]   be able to travel or to live a long life.
[00:18:59.040 --> 00:19:00.640]   That's not our greatest asset.
[00:19:00.640 --> 00:19:06.920]   Our greatest asset is what connects us to the living God, is our faith, because faith
[00:19:06.920 --> 00:19:10.760]   is what connects us to the author of life.
[00:19:10.760 --> 00:19:16.860]   And so you can imagine your wildest dream is trivial in the sight of our God.
[00:19:16.860 --> 00:19:22.640]   So whatever gives us the greatest access to this God is our greatest asset.
[00:19:22.640 --> 00:19:29.160]   So even if it causes sorrow, if it causes us to have greater faith, that's where we
[00:19:29.160 --> 00:19:31.160]   need to be.
[00:19:31.160 --> 00:19:39.800]   See Jesus was leading them deliberately into this great sorrow, into this great pain, and
[00:19:39.800 --> 00:19:42.720]   despair, and anxiety.
[00:19:42.720 --> 00:19:47.900]   And he says the reason why he was doing that is to increase their faith.
[00:19:47.900 --> 00:19:54.600]   Because when their faith is increased, all other problems are solved in the name of God.
[00:19:54.600 --> 00:19:58.760]   Verse 17 he says, "So when Jesus came, he found that he had already been in the tomb
[00:19:58.760 --> 00:20:00.720]   for four days."
[00:20:00.720 --> 00:20:04.080]   He was already in the tomb for four days because he didn't come immediately.
[00:20:04.080 --> 00:20:05.720]   And he allowed that to happen.
[00:20:05.720 --> 00:20:10.840]   Now you guys know that in the Bible, number three is the number of confirmation.
[00:20:10.840 --> 00:20:15.760]   So whenever you say you need to have confirmation, make sure there's confirmed by two or three.
[00:20:15.760 --> 00:20:19.520]   Jesus died and he resurrected on the third day for that reason.
[00:20:19.520 --> 00:20:23.100]   Here he says he was there for four days.
[00:20:23.100 --> 00:20:29.240]   Now what's interesting here is that the Jews didn't take much time to bury somebody because
[00:20:29.240 --> 00:20:32.040]   obviously they didn't have involvement or they couldn't afford it.
[00:20:32.040 --> 00:20:34.120]   You had to be filthy rich to do that.
[00:20:34.120 --> 00:20:38.600]   And so if the dead body is just lying there, especially in the heat, it would start to
[00:20:38.600 --> 00:20:40.340]   stink.
[00:20:40.340 --> 00:20:43.600]   So immediately within 24 hours they would bury the dead.
[00:20:43.600 --> 00:20:45.680]   And that was the typical practice.
[00:20:45.680 --> 00:20:49.240]   So if he's been dead for four days, most likely he's been in the grave for at least three
[00:20:49.240 --> 00:20:50.240]   days.
[00:20:50.240 --> 00:20:55.280]   Later on it says when Jesus tells Lazarus to come out, in the King James it says they
[00:20:55.280 --> 00:21:00.560]   responded, "Jesus, it stinketh."
[00:21:00.560 --> 00:21:03.120]   That's a literal translation in the King James.
[00:21:03.120 --> 00:21:05.920]   It stinketh.
[00:21:05.920 --> 00:21:09.520]   Meaning we've lost hope.
[00:21:09.520 --> 00:21:12.420]   Not only is he dead, there's no hope.
[00:21:12.420 --> 00:21:13.420]   It stinketh.
[00:21:13.420 --> 00:21:15.060]   His body is already rotted.
[00:21:15.060 --> 00:21:20.580]   Jesus deliberately waits until there is no hope.
[00:21:20.580 --> 00:21:26.620]   He says in verse 21, Martha said to Jesus, "Lord, if you had been here, my brother would
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.540]   not have died.
[00:21:28.540 --> 00:21:31.540]   Even now I know that whatever you ask of God, God will give you."
[00:21:31.540 --> 00:21:34.260]   Jesus said to her, "Your brother will rise again."
[00:21:34.260 --> 00:21:38.740]   Martha said to him, "I know that he will rise again in the resurrection on the last day."
[00:21:38.740 --> 00:21:43.380]   See, Martha believed what many of the other Jews believed, that there is some sort of
[00:21:43.380 --> 00:21:45.600]   resurrection that's going to take place at the end.
[00:21:45.600 --> 00:21:50.020]   And not understanding what Jesus was saying, knowing that Lazarus has already been in the
[00:21:50.020 --> 00:21:55.020]   grave for three days and dead for four, he said, "You must be talking about that, that
[00:21:55.020 --> 00:21:56.020]   resurrection."
[00:21:56.020 --> 00:22:02.300]   And in response to that, he makes this crystal clear why he's doing what he's doing.
[00:22:02.300 --> 00:22:07.180]   Jesus said to her, "I am the resurrection and the life.
[00:22:07.180 --> 00:22:12.300]   He who believes in me will live even if he dies.
[00:22:12.300 --> 00:22:16.040]   And everyone who lives and believes in me will never die.
[00:22:16.040 --> 00:22:18.820]   Do you believe this?"
[00:22:18.820 --> 00:22:22.980]   She said to him, "Yes, Lord, I have believed that you are the Christ, the Son of God, even
[00:22:22.980 --> 00:22:25.020]   he who comes into the world."
[00:22:25.020 --> 00:22:29.260]   Now, many of you probably already recognize that confession.
[00:22:29.260 --> 00:22:32.620]   Because Jesus asked this question of Peter with the disciples, "Who do men say that I
[00:22:32.620 --> 00:22:33.740]   am?"
[00:22:33.740 --> 00:22:35.820]   And then he says, "Peter, who do you say that I am?"
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:41.100]   And Peter answered, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."
[00:22:41.100 --> 00:22:44.300]   So Martha is giving the same response.
[00:22:44.300 --> 00:22:47.740]   You are the Christ, the Son.
[00:22:47.740 --> 00:22:53.820]   But the question that Jesus is asking is not simply a belief.
[00:22:53.820 --> 00:23:00.860]   Because he goes directly in and he says, "Do you believe that I am the resurrection and
[00:23:00.860 --> 00:23:02.020]   the life?
[00:23:02.020 --> 00:23:03.620]   I am the resurrection and the life."
[00:23:03.620 --> 00:23:06.940]   He's not asking, "Do you believe that I can give you life?"
[00:23:06.940 --> 00:23:11.340]   He's not asking, "Do you believe that if you follow me that I'm going to direct you to
[00:23:11.340 --> 00:23:12.340]   life?"
[00:23:12.340 --> 00:23:13.340]   He's not asking that.
[00:23:13.340 --> 00:23:16.940]   He says, "Do you believe I am the life?
[00:23:16.940 --> 00:23:20.420]   That if you believe in me, even if you die, you will live.
[00:23:20.420 --> 00:23:23.260]   Do you believe that?"
[00:23:23.260 --> 00:23:31.780]   So the question that he poses to Martha is the same question that he poses to all people.
[00:23:31.780 --> 00:23:34.020]   Do you believe this?
[00:23:34.020 --> 00:23:38.380]   Not if you come to Jesus that he's going to answer your prayers and that you're going
[00:23:38.380 --> 00:23:39.380]   to be healthy.
[00:23:39.380 --> 00:23:42.140]   You're going to be wealthy.
[00:23:42.140 --> 00:23:43.460]   That your circumstance is going to change.
[00:23:43.460 --> 00:23:44.460]   Your family is going to change.
[00:23:44.460 --> 00:23:45.460]   Your marriage is going to change.
[00:23:45.460 --> 00:23:46.460]   Your children are going to change.
[00:23:46.460 --> 00:23:50.120]   He said, "Do you believe I am the life?"
[00:23:50.120 --> 00:23:52.900]   Not that I'm going to give you this life.
[00:23:52.900 --> 00:23:56.380]   When Jesus says, "I am the way, the truth, and the life, no one comes to the Father but
[00:23:56.380 --> 00:23:57.380]   through me."
[00:23:57.380 --> 00:23:58.540]   He says, "I am the way.
[00:23:58.540 --> 00:23:59.540]   I am the truth."
[00:23:59.540 --> 00:24:00.980]   He doesn't say, "I speak the truth."
[00:24:00.980 --> 00:24:03.300]   He says, "I am the truth."
[00:24:03.300 --> 00:24:08.300]   So all the "I am" statements are things that people are placing hope through Jesus for
[00:24:08.300 --> 00:24:10.260]   something else.
[00:24:10.260 --> 00:24:13.580]   Do you believe I am?
[00:24:13.580 --> 00:24:18.100]   See this is a question that has to be answered.
[00:24:18.100 --> 00:24:23.820]   Look at the impact of Jesus' resurrection for the last 2,000 years.
[00:24:23.820 --> 00:24:26.140]   Is it affected politics?
[00:24:26.140 --> 00:24:28.380]   It affected economy?
[00:24:28.380 --> 00:24:29.900]   It affected science?
[00:24:29.900 --> 00:24:31.980]   It affected education?
[00:24:31.980 --> 00:24:33.420]   It affected culture, period.
[00:24:33.420 --> 00:24:38.980]   There's no historical event that has had even somewhere anywhere near the impact that the
[00:24:38.980 --> 00:24:42.300]   resurrection of Jesus Christ has had.
[00:24:42.300 --> 00:24:51.420]   So either this is the biggest deception of human history or if it is true, it is the
[00:24:51.420 --> 00:24:55.860]   biggest decision that every human being must be asked.
[00:24:55.860 --> 00:24:56.860]   Do you believe?
[00:24:56.860 --> 00:24:59.820]   Do you believe that Jesus is life?
[00:24:59.820 --> 00:25:04.460]   Either you answer this question, "No, I don't believe this.
[00:25:04.460 --> 00:25:06.820]   This is all just nonsense."
[00:25:06.820 --> 00:25:12.540]   And that you would shun the church and do your best to get everybody out of the church
[00:25:12.540 --> 00:25:17.420]   because every minute that you spend at church is not only a waste of time, it is detrimental
[00:25:17.420 --> 00:25:18.780]   to you.
[00:25:18.780 --> 00:25:23.900]   Because what you hear from the pulpit, from the Word of God, completely contradicts everything
[00:25:23.900 --> 00:25:26.300]   you hear from outside the world.
[00:25:26.300 --> 00:25:32.180]   You send your children to be educated so that they can have a good life, make good investments,
[00:25:32.180 --> 00:25:37.460]   do proper things so that they can make something of themselves in this world.
[00:25:37.460 --> 00:25:42.340]   And then you come to church and Jesus says, "He who seeks his life will lose it.
[00:25:42.340 --> 00:25:44.820]   He who loses his life for my sake will find it."
[00:25:44.820 --> 00:25:47.480]   You cannot serve mammon and God at the same time.
[00:25:47.480 --> 00:25:52.780]   If you want to come follow me, deny yourself, pick up your cross and follow me.
[00:25:52.780 --> 00:25:58.060]   So if you do not believe this, every second that you spend here, every person that you
[00:25:58.060 --> 00:26:04.700]   invite here, every single penny that you spend here is to hurt humanity.
[00:26:04.700 --> 00:26:10.500]   Or you say, "Yes, I do believe this."
[00:26:10.500 --> 00:26:16.380]   If you do believe this, that means everything that is taught outside of this world is to
[00:26:16.380 --> 00:26:19.300]   be shunned.
[00:26:19.300 --> 00:26:22.620]   Because it contradicts what Jesus says, contradicts what we learn.
[00:26:22.620 --> 00:26:31.540]   The basic principles of how to live in this world is contradicted by the Word of God.
[00:26:31.540 --> 00:26:37.780]   But the most foolish thing to do is to hear it and say, "Not yet."
[00:26:37.780 --> 00:26:40.580]   I don't want to make a decision, yes or no.
[00:26:40.580 --> 00:26:44.340]   I want to try to hold on to both as long as I can.
[00:26:44.340 --> 00:26:49.900]   And just kind of live your life not committed one way or the other.
[00:26:49.900 --> 00:26:54.140]   But the question that Jesus asks demands an answer.
[00:26:54.140 --> 00:27:00.740]   Do you believe that Jesus is the resurrection and Jesus is the life?
[00:27:00.740 --> 00:27:05.780]   How you answer that will change not only this life, but eternity.
[00:27:05.780 --> 00:27:11.060]   In 1 Corinthians 15, 53 to 56, it says, "For the perishable must put on the imperishable,
[00:27:11.060 --> 00:27:13.820]   and this mortal must put on immortality.
[00:27:13.820 --> 00:27:17.540]   But when this perishable will have put on the imperishable, and this mortal will have
[00:27:17.540 --> 00:27:22.380]   put on the immortality, then will come about the saying that is written, 'Death is swallowed
[00:27:22.380 --> 00:27:23.380]   up in victory.
[00:27:23.380 --> 00:27:25.460]   O death, where is your victory?
[00:27:25.460 --> 00:27:27.300]   O death, where is your sting?
[00:27:27.300 --> 00:27:33.060]   The sting of death is sin.'"
[00:27:33.060 --> 00:27:37.380]   Years ago, I taught ESL to Korean seniors.
[00:27:37.380 --> 00:27:41.340]   The young ones were in their 60s and the older ones were in their 80s.
[00:27:41.340 --> 00:27:47.300]   And so I taught one lesson for five years because they keep forgetting.
[00:27:47.300 --> 00:27:51.140]   I would teach this one lesson for three months and then I would revisit and it's like, "Hello,
[00:27:51.140 --> 00:27:52.900]   today is Monday."
[00:27:52.900 --> 00:27:56.020]   And then it was like they never heard it before.
[00:27:56.020 --> 00:27:58.180]   So I had a lot of fun teaching that class.
[00:27:58.180 --> 00:28:01.580]   My Korean improved because I had to teach it in Korean.
[00:28:01.580 --> 00:28:06.780]   But there's something that I noticed in that group, that the Christians and non-Christians
[00:28:06.780 --> 00:28:10.660]   were very distinct in the way that they approached death.
[00:28:10.660 --> 00:28:16.220]   There was a senior citizen apartment that was maybe about a half a block walk there.
[00:28:16.220 --> 00:28:20.820]   So every time I pulled up to the parking lot, about twice a week I would see an ambulance
[00:28:20.820 --> 00:28:22.900]   parked outside.
[00:28:22.900 --> 00:28:27.220]   And so initially I didn't know what it was, but after a while I realized that the ambulance
[00:28:27.220 --> 00:28:30.700]   was picking up people who passed away that night.
[00:28:30.700 --> 00:28:35.780]   And obviously as a young man, I was I think in my mid-30s at that time, and I would come
[00:28:35.780 --> 00:28:41.380]   up there and they would walk into the classroom and some of the ladies would, most of them
[00:28:41.380 --> 00:28:47.220]   were ladies, would come in and say, "Oh, another one went."
[00:28:47.220 --> 00:28:51.100]   I woke up this morning, "When is it my turn?"
[00:28:51.100 --> 00:28:54.980]   And again, as a young person, I'm like, "Well, that's morbid.
[00:28:54.980 --> 00:28:57.100]   Every day I'm hearing, 'When am I going to die?
[00:28:57.100 --> 00:29:00.300]   When am I going to die?'"
[00:29:00.300 --> 00:29:02.800]   There was this one particular lady.
[00:29:02.800 --> 00:29:08.340]   She spent all day, all she did all day was copy the Bible.
[00:29:08.340 --> 00:29:09.700]   That's all she did.
[00:29:09.700 --> 00:29:14.340]   She had a pen and paper and she had her Korean Bible open and all day she just copied it
[00:29:14.340 --> 00:29:15.860]   word for word.
[00:29:15.860 --> 00:29:20.540]   And I don't even know how much she remembered this, but just, that's all she did all day.
[00:29:20.540 --> 00:29:27.280]   I found out that when she was younger, she just got married and as a newlywed, the Korean
[00:29:27.280 --> 00:29:29.300]   War broke out.
[00:29:29.300 --> 00:29:33.900]   And when the Korean War broke out, her husband got dragged into the North Korean Army and
[00:29:33.900 --> 00:29:35.660]   she never saw him again.
[00:29:35.660 --> 00:29:41.380]   So she didn't know, she doesn't know if she survived this in North Korea or he died, but
[00:29:41.380 --> 00:29:43.600]   she never met him again.
[00:29:43.600 --> 00:29:46.260]   So she lived as a widow all her life.
[00:29:46.260 --> 00:29:50.320]   She never got married and she committed her life to Christ.
[00:29:50.320 --> 00:29:51.980]   And by the time I met her, she was waiting.
[00:29:51.980 --> 00:29:56.580]   So every time she would come in, she would be the most morbid.
[00:29:56.580 --> 00:30:01.140]   But the interesting thing was every time she said that, she had a big smile on her face.
[00:30:01.140 --> 00:30:05.160]   Another one went, "When's it my turn?"
[00:30:05.160 --> 00:30:10.540]   And then I saw some of the non-Christians every morning.
[00:30:10.540 --> 00:30:16.180]   Every morning we saw that ambulance there, they would walk into the classroom, dead silent,
[00:30:16.180 --> 00:30:18.380]   dead silent.
[00:30:18.380 --> 00:30:22.540]   Because they were frightened.
[00:30:22.540 --> 00:30:26.940]   Every time they saw that ambulance and they dreaded living in that apartment because the
[00:30:26.940 --> 00:30:31.500]   ambulance would come a couple times a week to pick up somebody.
[00:30:31.500 --> 00:30:35.420]   And I couldn't even bring it up because they were so afraid.
[00:30:35.420 --> 00:30:39.020]   They didn't know what was coming.
[00:30:39.020 --> 00:30:40.500]   Night and day.
[00:30:40.500 --> 00:30:46.900]   And after I realized, wow, these people who believed in Christ and had hope in Jesus,
[00:30:46.900 --> 00:30:50.460]   especially that lady, she was eagerly waiting.
[00:30:50.460 --> 00:30:52.700]   She suffered enough.
[00:30:52.700 --> 00:30:55.300]   She's waited long enough.
[00:30:55.300 --> 00:30:56.300]   When is it my turn?
[00:30:56.300 --> 00:30:58.660]   She was eager to go home.
[00:30:58.660 --> 00:31:02.780]   Versus somebody who did not believe, was fearful.
[00:31:02.780 --> 00:31:04.700]   Is this it?
[00:31:04.700 --> 00:31:08.460]   That everything that they've pursued in their life, is it over with this?
[00:31:08.460 --> 00:31:11.060]   And what comes afterwards?
[00:31:11.060 --> 00:31:14.580]   Jesus said he came to give life and to give this life abundantly.
[00:31:14.580 --> 00:31:19.140]   But look what he says here in verse 32.
[00:31:19.140 --> 00:31:24.420]   "Therefore, when Mary came where Jesus was, she saw him and fell at his feet, saying to
[00:31:24.420 --> 00:31:29.020]   him, 'Lord, if you had been here, my brother would not have died.'
[00:31:29.020 --> 00:31:33.940]   When Jesus therefore saw her weeping, and the Jews who came with her also weeping, he
[00:31:33.940 --> 00:31:39.060]   was deeply moved in spirit and was troubled, and said, 'Where have you laid him?'
[00:31:39.060 --> 00:31:40.980]   They said to him, 'Lord, come and see.'
[00:31:40.980 --> 00:31:43.500]   Jesus wept."
[00:31:43.500 --> 00:31:47.340]   The shortest verse in the Bible, Jesus wept.
[00:31:47.340 --> 00:31:52.460]   Now the question is, why did Jesus weep?
[00:31:52.460 --> 00:31:54.000]   Remember how he got here.
[00:31:54.000 --> 00:31:56.700]   He created this because he didn't come in time.
[00:31:56.700 --> 00:31:59.460]   He said this is not going to end in his death.
[00:31:59.460 --> 00:32:01.660]   It's for the glory of God.
[00:32:01.660 --> 00:32:07.460]   Because he loved them, he stayed a few more days and waited for her, waited for him to
[00:32:07.460 --> 00:32:11.740]   die so that he would show up after four days of him being dead.
[00:32:11.740 --> 00:32:18.300]   And now that he's in front of his tomb, he's about to raise him.
[00:32:18.300 --> 00:32:21.480]   Was Jesus just sympathetic?
[00:32:21.480 --> 00:32:22.540]   My daughter was like that.
[00:32:22.540 --> 00:32:28.900]   When she was born, when she was a little girl, if anybody was sad, she would be sad.
[00:32:28.900 --> 00:32:31.020]   So we would, you know, I don't know if you had babies like that.
[00:32:31.020 --> 00:32:36.740]   We would hold her in our arm and if you just pretend like you're crying, and you turn around,
[00:32:36.740 --> 00:32:39.280]   she's crying too.
[00:32:39.280 --> 00:32:43.780]   Or if she thought that in any way that I was kind of upset with Esther, she would start
[00:32:43.780 --> 00:32:44.840]   to tear up.
[00:32:44.840 --> 00:32:47.940]   She would look at my expression and she would tear up.
[00:32:47.940 --> 00:32:50.780]   Is that what's going on with Jesus?
[00:32:50.780 --> 00:32:53.540]   Like everything that he was planning to do is for the glory of God.
[00:32:53.540 --> 00:32:54.540]   He's not shocked.
[00:32:54.540 --> 00:32:55.540]   He deliberately waits.
[00:32:55.540 --> 00:32:59.300]   And he's about to raise Lazarus, but because they were crying, he just started crying with
[00:32:59.300 --> 00:33:00.960]   them.
[00:33:00.960 --> 00:33:04.080]   Is that what's happening?
[00:33:04.080 --> 00:33:06.860]   That is not what's happening here.
[00:33:06.860 --> 00:33:15.560]   In fact, the term for he was deeply moved, literally in the Greek, it means he was stirred
[00:33:15.560 --> 00:33:18.040]   and possibly even angered.
[00:33:18.040 --> 00:33:24.960]   The word for troubled, literally in the Greek dictionary said he was agitated.
[00:33:24.960 --> 00:33:30.640]   In fact, the word for Jesus wept, the word wept here is a different Greek word than the
[00:33:30.640 --> 00:33:35.700]   word that is used here to describe Mary and Martha and the Jews.
[00:33:35.700 --> 00:33:37.360]   The Jews, they wept.
[00:33:37.360 --> 00:33:39.040]   The word kleio is used.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:41.880]   The word kleio basically means to publicly lament.
[00:33:41.880 --> 00:33:47.320]   It was a public demonstration where they couldn't hold back and they were just crying out loud.
[00:33:47.320 --> 00:33:51.880]   The word that is used to describe Jesus weeping is dakruo.
[00:33:51.880 --> 00:33:54.480]   It means he shed a tear.
[00:33:54.480 --> 00:34:00.360]   That same word, dakruo, is only used in one other place in Luke chapter 1941 when Jesus
[00:34:00.360 --> 00:34:07.120]   is entering into Jerusalem where there's a huge party going on, but Jesus wept it says
[00:34:07.120 --> 00:34:11.040]   because he saw them because the judgment was coming.
[00:34:11.040 --> 00:34:16.000]   If you only knew what would bring you peace, but because you did not recognize the day
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:21.200]   of peace that was coming, he said, judgment is coming.
[00:34:21.200 --> 00:34:25.040]   And because of this judgment, it says he teared.
[00:34:25.040 --> 00:34:28.200]   There's a reason why a majority of them did not see him crying.
[00:34:28.200 --> 00:34:34.760]   It says they went on with their celebration because Jesus was saddened, agitated, possibly
[00:34:34.760 --> 00:34:35.760]   even angered.
[00:34:35.760 --> 00:34:39.840]   And it says he cried, he wept.
[00:34:39.840 --> 00:34:46.240]   I do not think that Jesus was crying simply because he was crying along with them.
[00:34:46.240 --> 00:34:57.300]   See, the scripture says that when man rebels against God, the result of that sin is death.
[00:34:57.300 --> 00:35:01.940]   And death is the most tangible evidence of man's rebellion because the Bible says in
[00:35:01.940 --> 00:35:04.480]   Genesis that that's what it would result in.
[00:35:04.480 --> 00:35:09.780]   Jesus is standing before them weeping and crying, or the people who are weeping and
[00:35:09.780 --> 00:35:16.480]   crying because it is evidence of the judgment upon mankind.
[00:35:16.480 --> 00:35:25.460]   See, Jesus did not come and suffer and humiliated and endure the excruciating pain of the cross
[00:35:25.460 --> 00:35:30.760]   simply because he was obligated, because God the Father told him to do so, and because
[00:35:30.760 --> 00:35:32.920]   he was an obedient child, he just did it.
[00:35:32.920 --> 00:35:34.600]   Jesus says nobody takes my life.
[00:35:34.600 --> 00:35:37.900]   I lay it down on my own accord, and I take it up on my own accord.
[00:35:37.900 --> 00:35:39.620]   He volunteered for this.
[00:35:39.620 --> 00:35:41.960]   Why did he volunteer for this?
[00:35:41.960 --> 00:35:45.640]   It says he wept.
[00:35:45.640 --> 00:35:49.560]   The Bible says that he is a sympathetic high priest.
[00:35:49.560 --> 00:35:52.480]   He weeps for us.
[00:35:52.480 --> 00:35:55.760]   He weeps for our sadness.
[00:35:55.760 --> 00:35:56.760]   He's sympathetic.
[00:35:56.760 --> 00:35:57.760]   He's compassionate.
[00:35:57.760 --> 00:36:08.200]   You know, when you go through hardship and the pain is so deep, sometimes words seem
[00:36:08.200 --> 00:36:10.480]   trivial.
[00:36:10.480 --> 00:36:14.740]   They send you a card, and people mean well.
[00:36:14.740 --> 00:36:15.740]   They mean well.
[00:36:15.740 --> 00:36:21.720]   They want to encourage you, but sometimes when you're in deep sorrow, words cannot justify
[00:36:21.720 --> 00:36:22.720]   it.
[00:36:22.720 --> 00:36:26.640]   In fact, it makes your pain seem trivial.
[00:36:26.640 --> 00:36:31.640]   The people who really love you sometimes just come and weeps with you, and then they weep
[00:36:31.640 --> 00:36:33.880]   for you.
[00:36:33.880 --> 00:36:41.600]   I believe that Jesus is weeping because he sees the result of sin, and their weeping
[00:36:41.600 --> 00:36:43.480]   causes him to weep.
[00:36:43.480 --> 00:36:49.240]   See, Psalm chapter 103, 10-13, he says, "He does not deal with us according to our sins,
[00:36:49.240 --> 00:36:51.160]   nor repay us according to our iniquities.
[00:36:51.160 --> 00:36:55.480]   For as high as the heavens are above the earth, so great is his steadfast love toward those
[00:36:55.480 --> 00:36:56.980]   who fear him.
[00:36:56.980 --> 00:37:01.360]   As far as the east is from the west, so far does he remove our transgressions from us.
[00:37:01.360 --> 00:37:06.480]   As far as father shows compassion to his children, so the Lord shows compassion to those who
[00:37:06.480 --> 00:37:08.640]   fear him."
[00:37:08.640 --> 00:37:10.100]   God is compassionate toward us.
[00:37:10.100 --> 00:37:15.800]   He came toward us because he has compassion for us.
[00:37:15.800 --> 00:37:24.120]   Sometimes we envision a God who is distant, just legally, judicially, he's making things
[00:37:24.120 --> 00:37:26.960]   and opening the door and say, "Hey, make sure this is what God desires.
[00:37:26.960 --> 00:37:30.800]   You want to glorify God, make sure you obey him and do this and that."
[00:37:30.800 --> 00:37:37.360]   But the Bible describes Christ as the perfect image of God the Father, and he is a sympathetic
[00:37:37.360 --> 00:37:43.120]   high priest who weeps for us, weeps for mankind.
[00:37:43.120 --> 00:37:50.240]   In fact, in Matthew 9, 36-38, Jesus seeing the people, he felt compassion for them because
[00:37:50.240 --> 00:37:54.120]   they were distressed and dispirited like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:37:54.120 --> 00:37:57.200]   Then he said to his disciples, "The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few."
[00:37:57.200 --> 00:38:02.360]   Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.
[00:38:02.360 --> 00:38:07.320]   Oftentimes we think of the Great Commission raising up disciples as a duty that we ought
[00:38:07.320 --> 00:38:11.080]   to carry out, which is true because the Bible says so.
[00:38:11.080 --> 00:38:17.480]   But the primary reason why he turned to his disciples to pray and to beseech, to beg the
[00:38:17.480 --> 00:38:23.640]   Lord of the harvest to send out more workers is because he had compassion for them, because
[00:38:23.640 --> 00:38:28.560]   he was broken for them, because he was weeping for them.
[00:38:28.560 --> 00:38:32.640]   I don't believe that that was the first time Jesus wept.
[00:38:32.640 --> 00:38:39.440]   I believe that Jesus was weeping the whole time he was on earth because he was able to
[00:38:39.440 --> 00:38:47.280]   see firsthand in human form what the result of sin looked like.
[00:38:47.280 --> 00:38:51.360]   So he became a sympathetic high priest.
[00:38:51.360 --> 00:38:55.840]   Matthew 14, 14, when he went ashore and he saw the great crowd and he had compassion
[00:38:55.840 --> 00:38:59.020]   on them and he healed their sick.
[00:38:59.020 --> 00:39:00.240]   Why did he heal them?
[00:39:00.240 --> 00:39:05.960]   The Bible says in order so that people can see his power and recognize who he is.
[00:39:05.960 --> 00:39:08.540]   That's what the Bible says.
[00:39:08.540 --> 00:39:15.080]   But immediately in that context, he said it was because he had compassion for them.
[00:39:15.080 --> 00:39:18.100]   It wasn't simply a judicial act.
[00:39:18.100 --> 00:39:20.580]   It wasn't simply so that he could obey.
[00:39:20.580 --> 00:39:22.560]   It was because he was broken for them.
[00:39:22.560 --> 00:39:27.720]   Matthew 15, 32, "Then Jesus called his disciples to him and said, 'I have compassion on the
[00:39:27.720 --> 00:39:32.200]   crowd because they have been with me for three days and have nothing to eat, and I am unwilling
[00:39:32.200 --> 00:39:37.440]   to send them away hungry lest they faint on the way.'"
[00:39:37.440 --> 00:39:43.880]   Most public miracle and as a result of his feeding of the 5,000 and the 4,000, Jesus
[00:39:43.880 --> 00:39:47.920]   actually gets rejected by these people.
[00:39:47.920 --> 00:39:52.560]   But instead of being angry, he said he had compassion.
[00:39:52.560 --> 00:39:55.160]   He knew what was going to happen.
[00:39:55.160 --> 00:39:58.580]   He knew that they would turn on him.
[00:39:58.580 --> 00:40:07.860]   And yet he cared enough, had compassion enough to feed them before they went.
[00:40:07.860 --> 00:40:10.400]   That's our Jesus.
[00:40:10.400 --> 00:40:16.860]   Our natural tendency is that when we see ugliness, we try to move away from that.
[00:40:16.860 --> 00:40:23.140]   Right now we have this huge homeless problem in California, and it's spreading everywhere.
[00:40:23.140 --> 00:40:24.980]   Doubling, tripling in number.
[00:40:24.980 --> 00:40:31.140]   And you guys, anywhere you drive, you'll see it, some places more than others.
[00:40:31.140 --> 00:40:34.500]   And as a result of that, there's been a movement to, "Hey, we've got to do something about
[00:40:34.500 --> 00:40:35.500]   this.
[00:40:35.500 --> 00:40:37.160]   We can't have them in our backyard.
[00:40:37.160 --> 00:40:38.460]   We can't have them on the freeway.
[00:40:38.460 --> 00:40:39.940]   It's not safe for our children."
[00:40:39.940 --> 00:40:43.060]   And so there's movements to deal with this issue.
[00:40:43.060 --> 00:40:44.920]   Understandable.
[00:40:44.920 --> 00:40:51.260]   It's one thing to go and to be compassionate and to care for them away from us, but when
[00:40:51.260 --> 00:40:58.200]   it starts to come into our backyard, our natural tendency is we don't buy homes near the homeless.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:41:01.340]   Even if you really have a heart for mercy ministry, you don't buy homes in the middle
[00:41:01.340 --> 00:41:02.340]   of that.
[00:41:02.340 --> 00:41:03.900]   You've got to protect your children.
[00:41:03.900 --> 00:41:12.780]   Our natural tendency is if we see ugliness, we have a tendency to move away from that.
[00:41:12.780 --> 00:41:20.140]   The scripture says that Jesus saw our ugliness, our filth.
[00:41:20.140 --> 00:41:25.860]   The sins that you know of, sometimes the sins that you may not even know of.
[00:41:25.860 --> 00:41:31.120]   Instead of shining us, he had compassion.
[00:41:31.120 --> 00:41:34.180]   I believe that's why he wept.
[00:41:34.180 --> 00:41:36.820]   And I believe that's why he came.
[00:41:36.820 --> 00:41:39.280]   I believe that's why he suffered.
[00:41:39.280 --> 00:41:41.700]   And I believe that's why he endured.
[00:41:41.700 --> 00:41:44.940]   And I believe that's why he was crucified.
[00:41:44.940 --> 00:41:50.700]   We have a sympathetic high priest who is able to sympathize with our weaknesses, but one
[00:41:50.700 --> 00:41:52.180]   who has been tempted in all things.
[00:41:52.180 --> 00:41:53.540]   We are yet without sin.
[00:41:53.540 --> 00:41:57.220]   Therefore, let us draw near with confidence to the throne of grace so that we may receive
[00:41:57.220 --> 00:42:00.500]   mercy and find grace to help in time of need.
[00:42:00.500 --> 00:42:05.020]   You see, the motivation behind the invitation to come to God isn't simply that the door
[00:42:05.020 --> 00:42:06.780]   is open.
[00:42:06.780 --> 00:42:07.780]   You got a free ticket.
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:08.780]   Get in here.
[00:42:08.780 --> 00:42:11.980]   He says it's because he cares.
[00:42:11.980 --> 00:42:12.980]   Because he's sympathetic.
[00:42:12.980 --> 00:42:14.420]   He understands.
[00:42:14.420 --> 00:42:15.940]   He's compassionate.
[00:42:15.940 --> 00:42:24.460]   He wants you to come so that he can help you.
[00:42:24.460 --> 00:42:26.620]   Verse 38.
[00:42:26.620 --> 00:42:32.300]   So Jesus again, being deeply moved within, came to the tomb.
[00:42:32.300 --> 00:42:35.900]   Now it was a cave and the stone was lying against it.
[00:42:35.900 --> 00:42:38.460]   Jesus said, "Remove the stone."
[00:42:38.460 --> 00:42:42.780]   Martha, the sister of the deceased, said to him, "Lord, by this time there will be a stench."
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:48.300]   And this is where in the King James it says, "He stinketh, for he has been dead for four
[00:42:48.300 --> 00:42:49.700]   days."
[00:42:49.700 --> 00:42:53.500]   Jesus said to her, "Did I not say to you that if you believe, you will see the glory of
[00:42:53.500 --> 00:42:54.500]   God?"
[00:42:54.500 --> 00:42:55.500]   So they removed the stone.
[00:42:55.500 --> 00:42:58.940]   Then Jesus raised his eyes and said, "Father, I thank you that you have heard me.
[00:42:58.940 --> 00:43:03.420]   I knew that you always hear me, but because of the people standing around, I said, 'So
[00:43:03.420 --> 00:43:07.140]   that they may believe that you sent me.'"
[00:43:07.140 --> 00:43:10.220]   Just as he said, "I'm going to do this to increase their faith."
[00:43:10.220 --> 00:43:16.060]   Verse 43, "When he had said these things, he cried out with a loud voice, 'Lazarus,
[00:43:16.060 --> 00:43:17.660]   come out!'
[00:43:17.660 --> 00:43:23.020]   The man who had died came forth, bound hand and foot with wrappings, and his face was
[00:43:23.020 --> 00:43:24.860]   wrapped around with a cloth.
[00:43:24.860 --> 00:43:28.180]   Jesus said to them, 'Unbind him and let him go.'
[00:43:28.180 --> 00:43:34.340]   Therefore, many of the Jews who came to Mary and saw what he had done, believed in him."
[00:43:34.340 --> 00:43:38.060]   Now let me ask you.
[00:43:38.060 --> 00:43:41.100]   Did Lazarus live forever from this point on?
[00:43:41.100 --> 00:43:45.340]   No, he did not.
[00:43:45.340 --> 00:43:48.660]   He was resuscitated for a period.
[00:43:48.660 --> 00:43:50.140]   He was resuscitated for a period.
[00:43:50.140 --> 00:43:52.260]   He just didn't die here.
[00:43:52.260 --> 00:43:58.480]   Eventually, Lazarus will also die along with Mary, Martha, all the disciples.
[00:43:58.480 --> 00:44:05.900]   But the point of why he resuscitated him is so that they may believe that when Jesus is
[00:44:05.900 --> 00:44:13.380]   resurrected from the dead, that that's the true resurrection to give us hope that even
[00:44:13.380 --> 00:44:17.260]   when we die, we will live.
[00:44:17.260 --> 00:44:22.100]   It is in this in John 5, 24, it says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, he who hears my word
[00:44:22.100 --> 00:44:24.880]   and believes in him who sent me has eternal life.
[00:44:24.880 --> 00:44:31.940]   He has it already and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life."
[00:44:31.940 --> 00:44:36.280]   This is why we celebrate the resurrection.
[00:44:36.280 --> 00:44:39.600]   This is the only hope that mankind has.
[00:44:39.600 --> 00:44:46.300]   If you're sick, you may be healed, but eventually you will die.
[00:44:46.300 --> 00:44:53.500]   If you are poor, you may get a job, you may have money, but eventually you will die.
[00:44:53.500 --> 00:44:57.740]   You may have problems with relationships, you may be experiencing sorrow and rejection
[00:44:57.740 --> 00:45:04.820]   and loneliness, and maybe all that gets taken care of, maybe by good judgment, maybe by
[00:45:04.820 --> 00:45:10.540]   changing of circumstance, but eventually we will all die.
[00:45:10.540 --> 00:45:14.500]   Jesus did not come to temporarily heal us.
[00:45:14.500 --> 00:45:17.460]   Jesus did not come so that our bellies may be full temporarily.
[00:45:17.460 --> 00:45:24.660]   So instead of dying early, that we die late, he came that you and I may have life and have
[00:45:24.660 --> 00:45:27.660]   it abundantly for eternity.
[00:45:27.660 --> 00:45:32.100]   And that's what he says, "If you believe this, do you believe this?"
[00:45:32.100 --> 00:45:37.080]   Some of you were invited here this morning from friends and family because they also
[00:45:37.080 --> 00:45:45.180]   want you to believe, because they want you to know Christ, this life that they've seen.
[00:45:45.180 --> 00:45:51.100]   So this morning I ask you, what you heard, maybe this is not the first time you've heard
[00:45:51.100 --> 00:45:55.200]   this, but you've never made a decision for Christ.
[00:45:55.200 --> 00:45:58.600]   Maybe you've been hearing bits and pieces of the gospel and you don't fully understand,
[00:45:58.600 --> 00:46:02.280]   or you may have understood and you just kind of postponed this decision.
[00:46:02.280 --> 00:46:03.840]   Not now.
[00:46:03.840 --> 00:46:05.120]   Not now.
[00:46:05.120 --> 00:46:08.480]   Today, if you hear his voice, do not harden your heart.
[00:46:08.480 --> 00:46:12.280]   It is the kindness of God that leads you to repentance.
[00:46:12.280 --> 00:46:18.520]   So the fact that God's word is piercing you, that the word of God is speaking to you, that
[00:46:18.520 --> 00:46:23.400]   in and of itself is the kindness of God that leads you to repentance.
[00:46:23.400 --> 00:46:26.880]   So my charge to you is do not delay.
[00:46:26.880 --> 00:46:29.200]   We don't know if we have tomorrow.
[00:46:29.200 --> 00:46:34.840]   If God is piercing you, come to the Lord today and ask for forgiveness.
[00:46:34.840 --> 00:46:39.680]   He says if you confess your sins, he is faithful and just to forgive you of all your unrighteousness.
[00:46:39.680 --> 00:46:46.640]   Today, he can unburden you of the guilt and shame that you are living with.
[00:46:46.640 --> 00:46:51.160]   And the only remedy for that is the blood of Jesus Christ.
[00:46:51.160 --> 00:46:56.280]   And the only way to have this new life is to believe that Jesus is the resurrection
[00:46:56.280 --> 00:46:58.960]   and the new life.
[00:46:58.960 --> 00:47:02.160]   Come to the Lord this morning.
[00:47:02.160 --> 00:47:03.680]   Confess your sins.
[00:47:03.680 --> 00:47:10.400]   Be forgiven and receive the eternal life that he promises all of us.
[00:47:10.400 --> 00:47:15.120]   Let's take some time to pray as we invite our worship team to come.
[00:47:15.120 --> 00:47:22.280]   Again, if you're here as a believer, take some time to pray before the Lord.
[00:47:22.280 --> 00:47:26.760]   If you've been just kind of wishy-washy in your faith, committed one time, uncommitted
[00:47:26.760 --> 00:47:32.160]   another, take this opportunity to really give your life to Christ, that he is worthy of
[00:47:32.160 --> 00:47:34.280]   my praise.
[00:47:34.280 --> 00:47:38.120]   And ask him, "Lord, I want to worship you in spirit and in truth.
[00:47:38.120 --> 00:47:41.680]   I want to worship you up close, not from a distance."
[00:47:41.680 --> 00:47:43.720]   And ask the Lord to give you help.
[00:47:43.720 --> 00:47:48.160]   "Lord, I believe, help my unbelief."
[00:47:48.160 --> 00:47:51.880]   If you're here and you've never confessed your sins, you've never been forgiven of
[00:47:51.880 --> 00:47:55.960]   your sins, come before the Lord.
[00:47:55.960 --> 00:47:57.960]   He's here.
[00:47:57.960 --> 00:48:00.260]   He will answer your prayers.
[00:48:00.260 --> 00:48:02.440]   Just confess it honestly.
[00:48:02.440 --> 00:48:05.060]   There is no formula.
[00:48:05.060 --> 00:48:09.240]   Every single one of us comes to him humbled, asking for forgiveness.
[00:48:09.240 --> 00:48:10.920]   And he will justify you of your sins.
[00:48:10.920 --> 00:48:12.440]   Take some time to come before the Lord.
[00:48:12.440 --> 00:48:16.960]   "Lord, open my eyes, soften my heart, that I may see you and invite you in my life as
[00:48:16.960 --> 00:48:18.480]   well."
[00:48:18.480 --> 00:48:21.040]   So let's take some time to pray again as our worship team leads us.
