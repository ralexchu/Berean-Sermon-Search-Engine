[00:09:07.860 --> 00:09:21.860]   - Good evening, everybody.
[00:09:21.860 --> 00:09:23.860]   We're glad that you're able to join us again.
[00:09:23.860 --> 00:09:27.860]   This week, again, we want to be deep in prayer,
[00:09:27.860 --> 00:09:30.860]   praying much, but also engrossed in the scriptures,
[00:09:30.860 --> 00:09:33.860]   reflecting and meditating about all the work
[00:09:33.860 --> 00:09:34.860]   that Christ has done.
[00:09:34.860 --> 00:09:37.860]   As we begin our evening devotion,
[00:09:37.860 --> 00:09:39.860]   let's begin with a word of prayer.
[00:09:39.860 --> 00:09:44.860]   Heavenly Father, we want to commune with you much
[00:09:44.860 --> 00:09:48.860]   this week, Lord, particularly Father God,
[00:09:48.860 --> 00:09:52.860]   reflecting upon your incredible salvation work
[00:09:52.860 --> 00:09:55.860]   that the scripture says is a mystery,
[00:09:55.860 --> 00:09:59.860]   a grand mystery from ages before you have been working.
[00:09:59.860 --> 00:10:04.860]   And your saints long to look at all the different parts,
[00:10:04.860 --> 00:10:06.860]   at all the elements, God.
[00:10:06.860 --> 00:10:08.860]   And according to your wisdom,
[00:10:08.860 --> 00:10:10.860]   according to your timetable,
[00:10:10.860 --> 00:10:11.860]   you have unfolded your plan.
[00:10:11.860 --> 00:10:14.860]   And for us, we have such a unique privilege, God,
[00:10:14.860 --> 00:10:17.860]   and we're so thankful that we can look back.
[00:10:17.860 --> 00:10:20.860]   We can look back at the salvation work of Christ.
[00:10:20.860 --> 00:10:23.860]   And I pray that that would have such significance
[00:10:23.860 --> 00:10:24.860]   to us personally.
[00:10:24.860 --> 00:10:27.860]   And Lord, as we devote our time to you,
[00:10:27.860 --> 00:10:30.860]   would you bless us for doing so, God, with faith.
[00:10:30.860 --> 00:10:33.860]   Lord, that our thoughts of you would be strengthened,
[00:10:33.860 --> 00:10:34.860]   it would be more clear,
[00:10:34.860 --> 00:10:37.860]   what's more, our affection for you would grow.
[00:10:37.860 --> 00:10:39.860]   And God, reflecting upon your love,
[00:10:39.860 --> 00:10:42.860]   and again, your amazing work towards us,
[00:10:42.860 --> 00:10:43.860]   and your grace.
[00:10:43.860 --> 00:10:44.860]   Lord, we thank you.
[00:10:44.860 --> 00:10:46.860]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:10:46.860 --> 00:10:47.860]   Amen.

[00:17:11.860 --> 00:17:17.860]   It's over the Father's heart to make a way for us.
[00:17:17.860 --> 00:17:24.860]   How boldly we have fought, how earthly confident.
[00:17:24.860 --> 00:17:32.860]   Jesus, it's Your blood.

[00:19:14.860 --> 00:19:20.860]   Good evening. Tonight we are reflecting on the Wednesday of the Passion Week.
[00:19:20.860 --> 00:19:27.860]   From Palm Sunday to Tuesday, Jesus and his disciples spend much of each day at the temple,
[00:19:27.860 --> 00:19:31.860]   and there is much teaching taking place on these days.
[00:19:31.860 --> 00:19:38.860]   Traditionally and historically, Wednesday of the Passion Week has been called Silent Wednesday.
[00:19:38.860 --> 00:19:46.860]   This is because the scripture doesn't say much about Wednesday outside of the preparation being made for the Passover.
[00:19:46.860 --> 00:19:52.860]   While Jesus and his disciples remain in Bethany for a last time of fellowship,
[00:19:52.860 --> 00:19:55.860]   and perhaps for some additional teaching,
[00:19:55.860 --> 00:20:01.860]   Judas returns alone to Jerusalem to arrange for his betrayal of Jesus.
[00:20:01.860 --> 00:20:08.860]   The scripture suggests that Judas was often sent out on errands as the group's treasurer,
[00:20:08.860 --> 00:20:14.860]   so none of the disciples probably thought much of his absence on this day.
[00:20:14.860 --> 00:20:20.860]   I'm going to read Luke chapter 22, verses 1 through 6 for you.
[00:20:20.860 --> 00:20:26.860]   "Now the Feast of Unleavened Bread, which is called the Passover, was approaching.
[00:20:26.860 --> 00:20:31.860]   The chief priests and the scribes were seeking how they might put him to death,
[00:20:31.860 --> 00:20:34.860]   for they were afraid of the people.
[00:20:34.860 --> 00:20:41.860]   And Satan entered into Judas, who was called Iscariot, belonging to the number of the Twelve.
[00:20:41.860 --> 00:20:48.860]   And he went away and discussed with the chief priests and officers how he might betray him to them.
[00:20:48.860 --> 00:20:51.860]   They were glad and agreed to give him money.
[00:20:51.860 --> 00:20:58.860]   So he consented and began seeking a good opportunity to betray him to them apart from the crowd."
[00:20:58.860 --> 00:21:01.860]   So here we see Satan at work.
[00:21:01.860 --> 00:21:05.860]   In verse 3, we have a very scary verse.
[00:21:05.860 --> 00:21:11.860]   Satan himself enters into Judas, one of the Twelve.
[00:21:11.860 --> 00:21:16.860]   The chief priests and scribes now had a willing inside man.
[00:21:16.860 --> 00:21:20.860]   They did not have to seek out any of the disciples.
[00:21:20.860 --> 00:21:23.860]   One of the disciples came to them.
[00:21:23.860 --> 00:21:26.860]   So an arrangement was made.
[00:21:26.860 --> 00:21:32.860]   Judas Iscariot, a disciple who had been handpicked by the Lord Jesus himself,
[00:21:32.860 --> 00:21:38.860]   was going to commit the biggest act of betrayal in the history of mankind.
[00:21:38.860 --> 00:21:40.860]   And this almost seems absurd.
[00:21:40.860 --> 00:21:47.860]   How could someone so close to Jesus turn on him in such a way?
[00:21:47.860 --> 00:21:50.860]   What kind of man was this Judas Iscariot?
[00:21:50.860 --> 00:21:58.860]   How sinister, how evil, how foolish must this man have been to do such a thing?
[00:21:58.860 --> 00:22:03.860]   So on this silent Wednesday, we're going to spend some time
[00:22:03.860 --> 00:22:07.860]   looking at what the Gospel accounts say about Judas Iscariot.
[00:22:07.860 --> 00:22:11.860]   So what do we know about Judas Iscariot?
[00:22:11.860 --> 00:22:18.860]   First, Judas had stuck with Jesus when most of the crowds turned away from him.
[00:22:18.860 --> 00:22:23.860]   Two Sundays ago, Pastor Peter preached out of John 6,
[00:22:23.860 --> 00:22:26.860]   where Jesus said that he was a bread of life.
[00:22:26.860 --> 00:22:32.860]   He told the crowds that he was the destination and not just the means.
[00:22:32.860 --> 00:22:34.860]   And in him was life.
[00:22:34.860 --> 00:22:36.860]   In him was eternal life.
[00:22:36.860 --> 00:22:38.860]   He was eternal life.
[00:22:38.860 --> 00:22:41.860]   And he did not come to fill their bellies.
[00:22:41.860 --> 00:22:44.860]   He was God incarnate.
[00:22:44.860 --> 00:22:50.860]   And Jesus' teachings started getting very hard to listen to and to understand.
[00:22:50.860 --> 00:22:53.860]   And at these hard teachings, most of the crowds withdrew
[00:22:53.860 --> 00:22:56.860]   and stopped walking with Jesus.
[00:22:56.860 --> 00:22:58.860]   But Judas stayed.
[00:22:58.860 --> 00:23:02.860]   And let me read for you the end portion of John 6.
[00:23:02.860 --> 00:23:05.860]   As a result of this, many of his disciples withdrew
[00:23:05.860 --> 00:23:08.860]   and were not walking with him anymore.
[00:23:08.860 --> 00:23:13.860]   So Jesus said to the twelfth, "You do not want to go away also, do you?"
[00:23:13.860 --> 00:23:17.860]   Simon Peter answered him, "Lord, to whom shall we go?
[00:23:17.860 --> 00:23:20.860]   You have words of eternal life.
[00:23:20.860 --> 00:23:25.860]   We have believed and have come to know that you are the Holy One of God."
[00:23:25.860 --> 00:23:29.860]   Whether it was only head knowledge or simply lip service,
[00:23:29.860 --> 00:23:35.860]   I'm sure at this point in time, this also was Judas' verbal confession.
[00:23:35.860 --> 00:23:39.860]   Perhaps he may have only mentally ascribed to these truths,
[00:23:39.860 --> 00:23:44.860]   but Judas too publicly confessed Jesus as the bread of life.
[00:23:44.860 --> 00:23:49.860]   And he backed up his confession by continuing on with Jesus.
[00:23:49.860 --> 00:23:56.860]   Secondly, Judas also had been given spiritual power and authority
[00:23:56.860 --> 00:23:59.860]   and had been commissioned to preach.
[00:23:59.860 --> 00:24:03.860]   So Judas, like the rest of the twelve, was with Jesus for most of the three years
[00:24:03.860 --> 00:24:06.860]   he did his public ministry.
[00:24:06.860 --> 00:24:10.860]   Judas not only witnessed and marveled at the miracles of Jesus,
[00:24:10.860 --> 00:24:13.860]   he himself performed miracles.
[00:24:13.860 --> 00:24:21.860]   He preached, he cleansed the lepers, he cast out demons, he healed the sick,
[00:24:21.860 --> 00:24:24.860]   and he perhaps even raised the dead.
[00:24:24.860 --> 00:24:27.860]   Matthew 10.
[00:24:27.860 --> 00:24:32.860]   Jesus summoned his twelve disciples and gave them authority over unclean spirits
[00:24:32.860 --> 00:24:36.860]   to cast them out and to heal every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[00:24:36.860 --> 00:24:38.860]   Verse 7.
[00:24:38.860 --> 00:24:44.860]   "And as you go, preach, saying, 'The kingdom of heaven is at hand.
[00:24:44.860 --> 00:24:50.860]   Heal the sick, raise the dead, cleanse the lepers, cast out demons,
[00:24:50.860 --> 00:24:54.860]   freely receive, freely give.'"
[00:24:54.860 --> 00:25:01.860]   And third, Judas had a trustworthy external appearance.
[00:25:01.860 --> 00:25:04.860]   John 12.4-6.
[00:25:04.860 --> 00:25:09.860]   "But Judas Iscariot, one of his disciples who was intending to betray him, said,
[00:25:09.860 --> 00:25:16.860]   'Why was his perfume not sold for three hundred denarii and given to poor people?'
[00:25:16.860 --> 00:25:23.860]   Now he said this not because he was concerned about the poor, but because he was a thief.
[00:25:23.860 --> 00:25:29.860]   And as he had the money box, he used to pilfer what was put into it."
[00:25:29.860 --> 00:25:34.860]   Here the scripture explicitly tells us that Judas was a thief.
[00:25:34.860 --> 00:25:40.860]   But there are a couple of details that I'm hoping that you don't miss first.
[00:25:40.860 --> 00:25:46.860]   Judas, amongst the disciples, is usually the one making mention of the poor.
[00:25:46.860 --> 00:25:50.860]   And Judas often says the right things.
[00:25:50.860 --> 00:25:54.860]   Second, he is a keeper of the money box.
[00:25:54.860 --> 00:25:57.860]   Notice it wasn't Matthew, the tax collector.
[00:25:57.860 --> 00:26:02.860]   Usually when we appoint or designate someone to handle a group's finances,
[00:26:02.860 --> 00:26:08.860]   we usually put the money into the hands of the one we deem most trustworthy.
[00:26:08.860 --> 00:26:13.860]   And it does not seem the other disciples had a problem with Judas being in charge of the finances
[00:26:13.860 --> 00:26:16.860]   because they trusted him.
[00:26:16.860 --> 00:26:18.860]   So what do we know about Judas Iscariot?
[00:26:18.860 --> 00:26:24.860]   One, he was a man who stuck with Jesus when most of the crowds had distanced themselves from him.
[00:26:24.860 --> 00:26:31.860]   Two, he was one who had been given spiritual authority and power to preach and to teach and perform miracles.
[00:26:31.860 --> 00:26:37.860]   And third, he was a man trusted by the eleven other disciples.
[00:26:37.860 --> 00:26:42.860]   So here we have to go into a little preview of tomorrow's, Thursday's events
[00:26:42.860 --> 00:26:47.860]   because we learn much more about the reputation of Judas Iscariot
[00:26:47.860 --> 00:26:50.860]   that he had with the rest of the disciples.
[00:26:50.860 --> 00:26:55.860]   So I'm going to briefly walk you through the 13th chapter of John
[00:26:55.860 --> 00:27:00.860]   and Jesus' interactions with Judas at the Last Supper.
[00:27:00.860 --> 00:27:02.860]   If you have your Bibles with you,
[00:27:02.860 --> 00:27:08.860]   I would encourage you to follow along as I quickly work through the details of John 13.
[00:27:08.860 --> 00:27:16.860]   The verses will be put up there for you, but you can fill in more gaps with your eyes if your Bibles are open.
[00:27:16.860 --> 00:27:18.860]   So John 13.
[00:27:18.860 --> 00:27:27.860]   Beginning in John 13 10, Jesus says four times that one of the twelve will betray him.
[00:27:27.860 --> 00:27:30.860]   Four times.
[00:27:30.860 --> 00:27:37.860]   And it is not obvious to a single person among them that Jesus was speaking about Judas Iscariot.
[00:27:37.860 --> 00:27:42.860]   Four times Jesus speaks of being betrayed by one of the twelve,
[00:27:42.860 --> 00:27:46.860]   and no one has a clue who he's talking about.
[00:27:46.860 --> 00:27:49.860]   Here's the first time, John 13 10 to 11.
[00:27:49.860 --> 00:27:52.860]   Jesus said to him,
[00:27:52.860 --> 00:27:57.860]   "He who is bathed needs only to wash his feet, but is completely clean.
[00:27:57.860 --> 00:28:00.860]   And you are clean, but not all of you.
[00:28:00.860 --> 00:28:03.860]   For he knew the one who was betraying him.
[00:28:03.860 --> 00:28:07.860]   For this reason he said, 'Not all of you are clean.'"
[00:28:07.860 --> 00:28:11.860]   Jesus just got done washing the disciples' feet,
[00:28:11.860 --> 00:28:17.860]   and there's nothing written about him skipping the washing of Judas' feet.
[00:28:17.860 --> 00:28:21.860]   So we can assume that he washed Judas' feet as well.
[00:28:21.860 --> 00:28:27.860]   The second time in verse 18, Jesus is a little bit more explicit.
[00:28:27.860 --> 00:28:32.860]   "I do not speak of all of you. I know the ones I have chosen.
[00:28:32.860 --> 00:28:35.860]   But it is that the scripture may be fulfilled,
[00:28:35.860 --> 00:28:41.860]   'He who eats my bread has lifted up his heel against me.'"
[00:28:41.860 --> 00:28:47.860]   And if they did not get it the first two times, Jesus says a third time in verse 21.
[00:28:47.860 --> 00:28:50.860]   And this time his spirit is troubled.
[00:28:50.860 --> 00:28:55.860]   And judging from the response of the disciples, my guess is at this time,
[00:28:55.860 --> 00:28:58.860]   there is now more emotion in his voice.
[00:28:58.860 --> 00:29:05.860]   Verse 21, "When Jesus had said this, he became troubled in spirit and testified and said,
[00:29:05.860 --> 00:29:14.860]   'Truly, truly, I say to you that one of you will betray me.'"
[00:29:14.860 --> 00:29:18.860]   So the disciples are now perceiving that Jesus is a bit upset.
[00:29:18.860 --> 00:29:21.860]   So they begin murmuring to one another.
[00:29:21.860 --> 00:29:28.860]   And you know what's absolutely crazy here is they still have no idea who he's talking about.
[00:29:28.860 --> 00:29:33.860]   Verses 22 to 25, "The disciples began looking at one another
[00:29:33.860 --> 00:29:38.860]   at a loss to know of which one he was speaking.
[00:29:38.860 --> 00:29:44.860]   And there was reclining on Jesus' bosom one of his disciples whom Jesus loved.
[00:29:44.860 --> 00:29:52.860]   So Simon Peter gestured to him and said to him, 'Tell us who it is of whom he is speaking.'
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:29:58.860]   And he," presumably John, "leaning back thus on Jesus' bosom said to him,
[00:29:58.860 --> 00:30:02.860]   'Lord, who is it?'"
[00:30:02.860 --> 00:30:05.860]   They had Judas there.
[00:30:05.860 --> 00:30:08.860]   He was beyond demon-possessed.
[00:30:08.860 --> 00:30:12.860]   He had spent time being influenced by Satan himself.
[00:30:12.860 --> 00:30:15.860]   In fact, in Luke's account, which you read in the beginning,
[00:30:15.860 --> 00:30:19.860]   it says that Satan had already entered into Judas.
[00:30:19.860 --> 00:30:22.860]   So Judas was beyond demon-possessed.
[00:30:22.860 --> 00:30:25.860]   He was beyond unclean spirit-possessed.
[00:30:25.860 --> 00:30:31.860]   He was perhaps Satan-possessed.
[00:30:31.860 --> 00:30:38.860]   And the other disciples have no idea that Judas is the one that Jesus was talking about.
[00:30:38.860 --> 00:30:43.860]   In fact, my guess is that he was the last one they would have suspected
[00:30:43.860 --> 00:30:46.860]   because they're second-guessing themselves.
[00:30:46.860 --> 00:30:50.860]   In Matthew 26, each of them is deeply grieved at this
[00:30:50.860 --> 00:30:57.860]   and each takes a turn asking Jesus, "Surely not I, Lord?"
[00:30:57.860 --> 00:31:04.860]   And this brings us to Jesus' fourth time speaking of his betrayal in verses 27 to 30.
[00:31:04.860 --> 00:31:11.860]   After the morsel, Satan then entered into him, Judas.
[00:31:11.860 --> 00:31:18.860]   And therefore Jesus said to him, "What you do, do quickly."
[00:31:18.860 --> 00:31:25.860]   Now no one of those reclining at the table knew for what purpose he had said this to him.
[00:31:25.860 --> 00:31:30.860]   For some were supposing because Judas had the money box
[00:31:30.860 --> 00:31:35.860]   that Jesus was saying to him, "Buy the things we have need of for the feast
[00:31:35.860 --> 00:31:39.860]   or else that he should give something to the poor."
[00:31:39.860 --> 00:31:45.860]   So after receiving the morsel, he went out immediately and it was night.
[00:31:45.860 --> 00:31:48.860]   I want to read verse 28 again for you.
[00:31:48.860 --> 00:31:54.860]   Now no one of those reclining at the table knew.
[00:31:54.860 --> 00:31:57.860]   The Greek word is "oudes."
[00:31:57.860 --> 00:32:02.860]   Not one person among them, "oudes."
[00:32:02.860 --> 00:32:06.860]   I have about six or seven children's Bibles at home.
[00:32:06.860 --> 00:32:13.860]   In all of them, you kind of know who Judas Iscariot is early on.
[00:32:13.860 --> 00:32:16.860]   He's the one with the scowl on his face.
[00:32:16.860 --> 00:32:19.860]   He's the one looking like he's up to no good.
[00:32:19.860 --> 00:32:23.860]   He's the one kind of standing off to the side.
[00:32:23.860 --> 00:32:29.860]   But in reality, he is so well put together that no one has an idea
[00:32:29.860 --> 00:32:32.860]   that Judas would be Jesus' betrayer.
[00:32:32.860 --> 00:32:36.860]   He's the last person they'd suspect.
[00:32:36.860 --> 00:32:41.860]   My guess is that he was a warm and jolly fellow.
[00:32:41.860 --> 00:32:44.860]   Very joyful perhaps.
[00:32:44.860 --> 00:32:51.860]   He may even have been the disciple whom Jesus corrected or rebuked the least.
[00:32:51.860 --> 00:32:56.860]   Even after Jesus says four times,
[00:32:56.860 --> 00:33:02.860]   the disciples still think that Judas was just being sent out on an errand.
[00:33:02.860 --> 00:33:09.860]   No one was suspecting him and saying, "Hey, where were you yesterday?
[00:33:09.860 --> 00:33:14.860]   You went alone to Jerusalem. What did you do there?"
[00:33:14.860 --> 00:33:19.860]   "Oudes." Not one person among them.
[00:33:19.860 --> 00:33:22.860]   So what does this teach us?
[00:33:22.860 --> 00:33:26.860]   First, that man's spiritual vision is horrible.
[00:33:26.860 --> 00:33:32.860]   Why does God tell the prophet Samuel not to judge by the outward external appearance?
[00:33:32.860 --> 00:33:35.860]   Because you and I are easily tricked and deceived.
[00:33:35.860 --> 00:33:42.860]   We read in 2 Corinthians 11.14 that Satan, and I would assume his cohorts,
[00:33:42.860 --> 00:33:46.860]   can appear as angels of light.
[00:33:46.860 --> 00:33:52.860]   So in our flesh, and naturally, we walk by sight and not by faith.
[00:33:52.860 --> 00:33:56.860]   So on Silent Wednesday, Jesus was betrayed by the last person
[00:33:56.860 --> 00:34:00.860]   his disciples would ever have suspected.
[00:34:00.860 --> 00:34:08.860]   Judas himself possibly had never imagined that he could be capable of such a thing.
[00:34:08.860 --> 00:34:12.860]   And what a sobering thought.
[00:34:12.860 --> 00:34:19.860]   There exists in every single one of us qualities of Judas Iscariot.
[00:34:19.860 --> 00:34:22.860]   And here are some positive ones.
[00:34:22.860 --> 00:34:27.860]   A commitment that perseveres to some degree.
[00:34:27.860 --> 00:34:32.860]   A good repute in the sight of many.
[00:34:32.860 --> 00:34:38.860]   The ability to say right-sounding things at the right time.
[00:34:38.860 --> 00:34:48.860]   And perhaps even varying degrees of spiritual talent, ability, and possibly even power.
[00:34:48.860 --> 00:34:53.860]   And here's a not-so-positive one quality.
[00:34:53.860 --> 00:35:02.860]   Exchanging an eternal relationship with the Son of God for 30 pieces of silver.
[00:35:02.860 --> 00:35:06.860]   So here is a sobering question to ask yourself.
[00:35:06.860 --> 00:35:15.860]   Is there some Judas betrayer in me?
[00:35:15.860 --> 00:35:21.860]   If it were not for the grace of God, Judas' story could very well be our story.
[00:35:21.860 --> 00:35:29.860]   Had it not been for the grace of God, our demise would have been no different from Judas'.
[00:35:29.860 --> 00:35:32.860]   We were all asked a question a few weeks ago.
[00:35:32.860 --> 00:35:38.860]   Is Christ the destination? Is he merely a means?
[00:35:38.860 --> 00:35:41.860]   And I want us to turn to that passage.
[00:35:41.860 --> 00:35:49.860]   And I'm going to take our attentions back to John chapter 6 because Judas is mentioned there.
[00:35:49.860 --> 00:36:00.860]   In Judas' story, we see the end result of someone for whom Jesus was only the means and not the destination.
[00:36:00.860 --> 00:36:05.860]   And I'm going to read John 6, 64 to 65. It says,
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:09.860]   "But there are some of you who do not believe.
[00:36:09.860 --> 00:36:14.860]   For Jesus knew from the beginning who they were who did not believe,
[00:36:14.860 --> 00:36:18.860]   and who it was that would betray him.
[00:36:18.860 --> 00:36:24.860]   And he was saying, 'For this reason I have said to you that no one can come to me
[00:36:24.860 --> 00:36:28.860]   unless it has been granted him from the Father.'"
[00:36:28.860 --> 00:36:33.860]   And John 6 tells us that for Judas, Christ was the means.
[00:36:33.860 --> 00:36:40.860]   And at the end of the day, Judas was disappointed with the means of Christ.
[00:36:40.860 --> 00:36:49.860]   That's perhaps why he is so indignant when Mary breaks open the alabaster jar of costly perfume.
[00:36:49.860 --> 00:36:54.860]   Yes, in Matthew 26 it says he's indignant.
[00:36:54.860 --> 00:36:59.860]   And perhaps that was the last straw for Judas.
[00:36:59.860 --> 00:37:05.860]   Jesus had known from the very beginning, it says in John 6, what Judas would eventually do.
[00:37:05.860 --> 00:37:09.860]   And yet, Jesus invited him in.
[00:37:09.860 --> 00:37:16.860]   And I can't presume to know how Jesus must have felt every day interacting with Judas.
[00:37:16.860 --> 00:37:24.860]   But it's not hard to imagine that he loved Judas the same as he had loved the other disciples.
[00:37:24.860 --> 00:37:28.860]   He treated Judas the same.
[00:37:28.860 --> 00:37:37.860]   And it would not be out of character for Jesus to also tenderly have washed Judas' feet the same way.
[00:37:37.860 --> 00:37:40.860]   And why do I believe this?
[00:37:40.860 --> 00:37:47.860]   Jesus, the radiance of the Father's glory and the exact representation of his nature,
[00:37:47.860 --> 00:37:51.860]   he too loves his enemies.
[00:37:51.860 --> 00:37:56.860]   And we serve a God who is able to love his enemies.
[00:37:56.860 --> 00:38:00.860]   We serve a God who would give his life for his enemies.
[00:38:00.860 --> 00:38:03.860]   And that's what this week is about.
[00:38:03.860 --> 00:38:07.860]   Romans 5, 6 through 8.
[00:38:07.860 --> 00:38:14.860]   For while we were still helpless, at the right time Christ died for the ungodly.
[00:38:14.860 --> 00:38:18.860]   For one will hardly die for a righteous man,
[00:38:18.860 --> 00:38:24.860]   though perhaps for the good man someone would dare even to die.
[00:38:24.860 --> 00:38:30.860]   But God demonstrates his own love towards us.
[00:38:30.860 --> 00:38:35.860]   And that while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us.
[00:38:35.860 --> 00:38:40.860]   But God demonstrates his own love for us.
[00:38:40.860 --> 00:38:52.860]   In that while we all were just as capable of betrayal, like Judas, Christ died for us.
[00:38:52.860 --> 00:38:55.860]   This is what we are celebrating this week.
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:58.860]   This is what we are reflecting on this week.
[00:38:58.860 --> 00:39:05.860]   Were it not for the grace of God and Christ's work on the cross and the power of his resurrection,
[00:39:05.860 --> 00:39:10.860]   our judgment would be no different from Judas's.
[00:39:10.860 --> 00:39:23.860]   So on this silent Wednesday, may Judas's life and example and betrayal humble us.
[00:39:23.860 --> 00:39:27.860]   May it sober us up.
[00:39:27.860 --> 00:39:38.860]   May Judas's life serve as a reminder for you and me to value Christ as our destination
[00:39:38.860 --> 00:39:41.860]   and not simply as our means.
[00:39:41.860 --> 00:39:48.860]   Let's pray together.
[00:39:48.860 --> 00:39:57.860]   Lord, when we see and when we take an examination of our hearts,
[00:39:57.860 --> 00:40:04.860]   more often than not, we're disturbed by the ugliness that we see.
[00:40:04.860 --> 00:40:11.860]   And it is our confession, Lord, that there is nothing good in us outside of Jesus Christ.
[00:40:11.860 --> 00:40:14.860]   There is nothing lovable in us.
[00:40:14.860 --> 00:40:20.860]   There is nothing desirable in us outside of Christ.
[00:40:20.860 --> 00:40:23.860]   Yet you died.
[00:40:23.860 --> 00:40:25.860]   Yet you loved.
[00:40:25.860 --> 00:40:29.860]   And yet you served.
[00:40:29.860 --> 00:40:34.860]   I pray that this week would cause us to be humble.
[00:40:34.860 --> 00:40:40.860]   It would cause us to be joy-filled and thankful.
[00:40:40.860 --> 00:40:46.860]   It would cause us not to harbor grudges or resentment,
[00:40:46.860 --> 00:40:53.860]   to point to the unfathomable love of God.
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:41:01.860]   Thank you, Lord, for loving those who were hostile to you.
[00:41:01.860 --> 00:41:11.860]   We who were once enemies now stand as children who delight in the presence of their Father.
[00:41:11.860 --> 00:41:14.860]   We give you the praise that you're due.
[00:41:14.860 --> 00:41:16.860]   Thank you.
[00:41:16.860 --> 00:41:20.860]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:41:20.860 --> 00:41:49.860]   [music]
[00:41:49.860 --> 00:41:52.860]   Mercy reigns.
[00:41:52.860 --> 00:41:59.860]   And I will die.
[00:41:59.860 --> 00:42:05.860]   River of blood, streams of grain,
[00:42:05.860 --> 00:42:12.860]   I'll drink them all.
[00:42:12.860 --> 00:42:28.860]   All the love I've ever found, like a flood flowing down.
[00:42:28.860 --> 00:42:35.860]   At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life.
[00:42:35.860 --> 00:42:38.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:42:38.860 --> 00:42:41.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:42:41.860 --> 00:42:47.860]   Where your love ran red and my sin washed white,
[00:42:47.860 --> 00:42:50.860]   I owe all to you.
[00:42:50.860 --> 00:43:01.860]   I owe all to you, Jesus.
[00:43:01.860 --> 00:43:14.860]   There's a place, sin and shame, I will lay.
[00:43:14.860 --> 00:43:26.860]   Where my heart is at peace with God, I give them.
[00:43:26.860 --> 00:43:42.860]   All the love I've ever found, like a flood flowing down.
[00:43:42.860 --> 00:43:49.860]   At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life.
[00:43:49.860 --> 00:43:52.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:43:52.860 --> 00:43:55.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:43:55.860 --> 00:44:01.860]   Where your love ran red and my sin washed white,
[00:44:01.860 --> 00:44:04.860]   I owe all to you.
[00:44:04.860 --> 00:44:07.860]   I owe all to you.
[00:44:07.860 --> 00:44:09.860]   Here my hope.
[00:44:09.860 --> 00:44:12.860]   Here my hope is found.
[00:44:12.860 --> 00:44:15.860]   Here on holy ground.
[00:44:15.860 --> 00:44:18.860]   Here I bow down.
[00:44:18.860 --> 00:44:21.860]   Here I bow down.
[00:44:21.860 --> 00:44:25.860]   Here arms open wide.
[00:44:25.860 --> 00:44:28.860]   Here you save my life.
[00:44:28.860 --> 00:44:31.860]   Here I bow down.
[00:44:31.860 --> 00:44:35.860]   Here I bow down.
[00:44:35.860 --> 00:44:42.860]   At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life.
[00:44:42.860 --> 00:44:45.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:44:45.860 --> 00:44:48.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:44:48.860 --> 00:44:55.860]   Where your love ran red and my sin washed white,
[00:44:55.860 --> 00:44:58.860]   I owe all to you.
[00:44:58.860 --> 00:45:01.860]   I owe all to you.
[00:45:01.860 --> 00:45:08.860]   At the cross, at the cross, I surrender my life.
[00:45:08.860 --> 00:45:11.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:45:11.860 --> 00:45:14.860]   I'm in all of you.
[00:45:14.860 --> 00:45:21.860]   Where your love ran red and my sin washed white,
[00:45:21.860 --> 00:45:24.860]   I owe all to you.
[00:45:24.860 --> 00:45:28.860]   I owe all to you, Jesus.
[00:45:28.860 --> 00:45:37.860]   Amen.
[00:45:37.860 --> 00:45:39.860]   Let's pray together.
[00:45:39.860 --> 00:45:44.860]   Father, we reflect and meditate on your incredible love.
[00:45:44.860 --> 00:45:48.860]   God, all through this week, we recognize truly how patient
[00:45:48.860 --> 00:45:52.860]   your love is, truly how powerful your love is.
[00:45:52.860 --> 00:45:56.860]   God, we are reminded, every single one of us, Lord,
[00:45:56.860 --> 00:45:59.860]   we are so stained with sin.
[00:45:59.860 --> 00:46:03.860]   And God, at depths of which we keep seeing as we live.
[00:46:03.860 --> 00:46:07.860]   And God, we recognize that should we be given the chance,
[00:46:07.860 --> 00:46:12.860]   so to speak, it very well, the aspect of that kind of betraying
[00:46:12.860 --> 00:46:17.860]   selfishness that exists in every single one of us.
[00:46:17.860 --> 00:46:20.860]   But we are so thankful, Lord, that you redeem.
[00:46:20.860 --> 00:46:24.860]   We are so thankful, God, that you transform.
[00:46:24.860 --> 00:46:27.860]   And God, you are changing those who were in it.
[00:46:27.860 --> 00:46:30.860]   And through your gospel and through your salvation,
[00:46:30.860 --> 00:46:33.860]   you are presenting us blameless.
[00:46:33.860 --> 00:46:35.860]   Father, that truth is so astounding.
[00:46:35.860 --> 00:46:38.860]   And we thank you for it over and over again.
[00:46:38.860 --> 00:46:40.860]   I do pray again that every single one of us,
[00:46:40.860 --> 00:46:42.860]   all the brothers and sisters at our church,
[00:46:42.860 --> 00:46:46.860]   will continue to walk down the path of recognizing and seeing
[00:46:46.860 --> 00:46:49.860]   truly how deep and extensive your love is.
[00:46:49.860 --> 00:46:51.860]   And God, that your love would grip us, Lord,
[00:46:51.860 --> 00:46:55.860]   and that your love is, Father, the power that's causing us to
[00:46:55.860 --> 00:46:57.860]   be walking in faithfulness to you.
[00:46:57.860 --> 00:47:01.860]   We thank you, Lord, and again devote both our song,
[00:47:01.860 --> 00:47:03.860]   our attention, and our faith to you.
[00:47:03.860 --> 00:47:04.860]   It's in Christ, and we pray.
[00:47:04.860 --> 00:47:05.860]   Amen.
[00:47:05.860 --> 00:47:07.860]   Have a good night, everyone.
