[00:11:14.520 --> 00:11:17.640]   - Good morning, church family, happy Lord's Day.
[00:11:17.640 --> 00:11:20.720]   Let's continue to pray for our India mission team
[00:11:20.720 --> 00:11:24.680]   who left last Friday as they help the pastors in India
[00:11:24.680 --> 00:11:26.600]   in their gospel work.
[00:11:26.600 --> 00:11:29.160]   This morning, we begin with the song, "Oh Great God,"
[00:11:29.160 --> 00:11:31.820]   which I hope would be our earnest prayer to the Lord
[00:11:31.820 --> 00:11:34.000]   in light of the gospel we received.
[00:11:34.000 --> 00:11:36.940]   And I'll read a short passage from Ephesians 2.
[00:11:36.940 --> 00:11:41.400]   And you were dead in the trespasses and sins
[00:11:41.400 --> 00:11:44.800]   in which you once walked following the course of this world
[00:11:44.800 --> 00:11:47.840]   among whom we all once lived in the passions of our flesh
[00:11:47.840 --> 00:11:50.480]   and were by nature children of wrath.
[00:11:50.480 --> 00:11:53.360]   But God, being rich in mercy because of the great love
[00:11:53.360 --> 00:11:55.160]   with which he loved us,
[00:11:55.160 --> 00:11:57.640]   even when we were dead in our trespasses,
[00:11:57.640 --> 00:11:59.800]   made us alive together with Christ.
[00:11:59.800 --> 00:12:01.860]   By grace, you have been saved.
[00:12:01.860 --> 00:12:02.700]   Amen.
[00:12:02.700 --> 00:12:09.080]   (soft piano music)

[00:14:56.980 --> 00:15:13.860]   Well, good morning, everybody.
[00:15:13.860 --> 00:15:17.540]   I just have three really quick announcements.
[00:15:17.540 --> 00:15:19.460]   The first one, as Isaac had mentioned,
[00:15:19.460 --> 00:15:23.740]   our 19-member team to India,
[00:15:23.740 --> 00:15:25.020]   they've probably just arrived
[00:15:25.020 --> 00:15:27.180]   and they're now on their way to the villages.
[00:15:27.180 --> 00:15:29.820]   So please pray for them this week
[00:15:29.820 --> 00:15:32.620]   as they are doing very sensitive work
[00:15:32.620 --> 00:15:36.160]   and as they're doing a lot of fruitful work.
[00:15:36.160 --> 00:15:38.660]   And they have no time really to rest.
[00:15:38.660 --> 00:15:40.740]   So please keep them in your prayers.
[00:15:40.740 --> 00:15:42.260]   They'll be back on Saturday
[00:15:42.260 --> 00:15:46.340]   and then they'll be with us next Sunday for worship.
[00:15:46.340 --> 00:15:49.300]   A couple things that I wanna just highlight.
[00:15:49.300 --> 00:15:50.460]   We have a bunch of announcements,
[00:15:50.460 --> 00:15:52.940]   but you can look at most of those just on your own.
[00:15:52.940 --> 00:15:57.220]   The first one is for the men of the church.
[00:15:57.220 --> 00:16:02.220]   In a few weeks, February 17th, we have the men's workshop.
[00:16:02.220 --> 00:16:04.340]   And we need you to sign up ASAP
[00:16:04.340 --> 00:16:06.660]   so we can figure out the food, okay?
[00:16:06.660 --> 00:16:09.040]   So it's gonna be nine to one.
[00:16:09.040 --> 00:16:11.320]   And our pastor Sung Kang,
[00:16:11.320 --> 00:16:15.940]   he preached for A Good Friday a few years ago.
[00:16:15.940 --> 00:16:18.380]   So he's gonna be walking with us
[00:16:18.380 --> 00:16:21.420]   through just what it means, personal holiness of men.
[00:16:21.420 --> 00:16:25.980]   And so February 17th, so please do sign up for that
[00:16:25.980 --> 00:16:28.740]   and register so that we can account for food, okay?
[00:16:28.740 --> 00:16:33.620]   Thirdly, today is the last day for you members
[00:16:33.620 --> 00:16:35.460]   to turn in the membership covenant.
[00:16:35.460 --> 00:16:37.420]   I've been reading and tracking each one
[00:16:37.420 --> 00:16:39.000]   that's been coming in.
[00:16:39.000 --> 00:16:42.620]   And I know who you are who haven't turned it in yet,
[00:16:42.620 --> 00:16:44.480]   even though you've had three weeks, okay?
[00:16:44.480 --> 00:16:46.820]   So please do turn that in today
[00:16:46.820 --> 00:16:51.680]   or we may resort to the Asian public shaming methods.
[00:16:51.680 --> 00:16:53.340]   All right, so you've been warned.
[00:16:53.340 --> 00:16:56.660]   I'm half kidding, okay?
[00:16:56.660 --> 00:16:58.900]   We do have an offering box in the back
[00:16:58.900 --> 00:17:02.740]   if you wanna give a physical offering.
[00:17:02.740 --> 00:17:05.620]   Otherwise, you can send in your electronic payments,
[00:17:05.620 --> 00:17:07.740]   not payments, electronic offering.
[00:17:07.740 --> 00:17:09.820]   But let me go ahead and pray for this
[00:17:09.820 --> 00:17:12.700]   and we'll continue on with our service.
[00:17:12.700 --> 00:17:15.520]   Father, thank you for just the joy
[00:17:15.520 --> 00:17:18.480]   of gathering together with your saints this morning.
[00:17:18.480 --> 00:17:22.880]   And all over the world, people have gathered
[00:17:22.880 --> 00:17:24.880]   to proclaim your excellencies
[00:17:24.880 --> 00:17:27.140]   and to hear your word and the fellowship.
[00:17:27.140 --> 00:17:29.720]   And I pray for us this morning
[00:17:29.720 --> 00:17:32.520]   that our worship would first and foremost
[00:17:32.520 --> 00:17:37.080]   be pleasing to you as you are the audience.
[00:17:37.080 --> 00:17:39.800]   You are the VIP here.
[00:17:39.800 --> 00:17:41.000]   And so we're here for you.
[00:17:41.020 --> 00:17:43.260]   And so I pray that you would fill
[00:17:43.260 --> 00:17:46.980]   our minds and our hearts with awe.
[00:17:46.980 --> 00:17:49.860]   You would speak to us, feed your people.
[00:17:49.860 --> 00:17:52.820]   And Lord, would you do your work
[00:17:52.820 --> 00:17:54.180]   in our hearts and in our lives.
[00:17:54.180 --> 00:17:56.660]   And we thank you, Lord, for just providing
[00:17:56.660 --> 00:17:57.580]   for all our needs.
[00:17:57.580 --> 00:18:00.220]   We pray that you would help us to steward well
[00:18:00.220 --> 00:18:02.940]   everything that you give us.
[00:18:02.940 --> 00:18:05.580]   And we acknowledge, Lord God, that it's all yours anyway.
[00:18:05.580 --> 00:18:09.420]   And so we bring this morning just our tithes
[00:18:09.420 --> 00:18:11.480]   and offerings to say thank you
[00:18:11.480 --> 00:18:14.360]   and acknowledge your lordship over our lives.
[00:18:14.360 --> 00:18:18.080]   Guard and protect our service this morning
[00:18:18.080 --> 00:18:19.720]   for your glory and for our joy.
[00:18:19.720 --> 00:18:20.880]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:18:20.880 --> 00:18:24.780]   (gentle music)

[00:28:20.220 --> 00:28:27.520]   - Well, if you guys have your Bibles,
[00:28:27.520 --> 00:28:31.620]   please turn with me to Galatians chapter two.
[00:28:31.620 --> 00:28:36.820]   And I'm gonna be reading verses 19 to 21 for us.
[00:28:36.820 --> 00:28:40.140]   Galatians chapter two, verses 19 to 21.
[00:28:40.140 --> 00:28:45.080]   For through the law, I die to the law,
[00:28:45.080 --> 00:28:47.560]   so that I might live to God.
[00:28:47.560 --> 00:28:50.360]   I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:28:50.360 --> 00:28:54.240]   and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[00:28:54.240 --> 00:28:57.820]   In the life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:28:57.820 --> 00:29:00.000]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:29:00.000 --> 00:29:03.320]   who loved me and gave himself for me.
[00:29:03.320 --> 00:29:06.320]   I do not nullify the grace of God,
[00:29:06.320 --> 00:29:08.760]   for if righteousness comes through the law,
[00:29:08.760 --> 00:29:10.600]   then Christ died needlessly.
[00:29:10.600 --> 00:29:11.640]   Let us pray together.
[00:29:11.640 --> 00:29:16.880]   Father, would you grant us a great day of reminders?
[00:29:17.720 --> 00:29:22.120]   Of encouragement, of challenge,
[00:29:22.120 --> 00:29:26.480]   and would you cause us to remember our identity in Christ?
[00:29:26.480 --> 00:29:29.540]   Speak, Lord, your servants are listening.
[00:29:29.540 --> 00:29:35.080]   Feed us, transform our hearts,
[00:29:35.080 --> 00:29:38.080]   help us to continue to grow.
[00:29:38.080 --> 00:29:39.480]   We pray this in Jesus' name.
[00:29:39.480 --> 00:29:45.040]   Well, you're all familiar with the word metamorphosis.
[00:29:45.040 --> 00:29:48.000]   It's one of the first five-syllable words
[00:29:48.000 --> 00:29:50.100]   grade school children learn.
[00:29:50.100 --> 00:29:53.760]   The process of metamorphosis in the animal kingdom
[00:29:53.760 --> 00:29:57.140]   is common knowledge, and through centuries,
[00:29:57.140 --> 00:29:59.680]   it has been repeatedly observed
[00:29:59.680 --> 00:30:02.480]   that certain creatures in the animal kingdom
[00:30:02.480 --> 00:30:07.040]   go through a process of metamorphosis in their life cycles.
[00:30:07.040 --> 00:30:11.720]   And metamorphosis is especially common in insects,
[00:30:11.720 --> 00:30:16.080]   and insects generally undergo two types of metamorphosis,
[00:30:16.080 --> 00:30:20.560]   incomplete metamorphosis and complete metamorphosis.
[00:30:20.560 --> 00:30:24.440]   So grasshoppers, dragonflies, and cockroaches
[00:30:24.440 --> 00:30:26.520]   have what scientists would call
[00:30:26.520 --> 00:30:30.320]   an incomplete or partial metamorphosis,
[00:30:30.320 --> 00:30:32.800]   where the young just look like
[00:30:32.800 --> 00:30:35.240]   wingless miniature versions of the adults.
[00:30:35.240 --> 00:30:38.120]   But insects like butterflies and moths
[00:30:38.120 --> 00:30:40.520]   undergo a complete metamorphosis,
[00:30:40.520 --> 00:30:43.520]   where the young not only look entirely different
[00:30:43.520 --> 00:30:48.320]   from the adults, but they consume completely different foods
[00:30:48.320 --> 00:30:50.920]   and exhibit completely different behaviors.
[00:30:50.920 --> 00:30:54.480]   And we've all learned about this.
[00:30:54.480 --> 00:30:56.060]   A butterfly starts as an egg,
[00:30:56.060 --> 00:30:58.720]   then eats voraciously as a caterpillar,
[00:30:58.720 --> 00:31:01.040]   becomes a chrysalis, and then matures
[00:31:01.040 --> 00:31:04.280]   into a beautifully shaped winged creature.
[00:31:04.280 --> 00:31:08.840]   The life cycle of a butterfly is very textbook stuff.
[00:31:08.840 --> 00:31:13.160]   It's pretty standard, and this has been observed,
[00:31:13.160 --> 00:31:15.560]   confirmed, and factualized
[00:31:15.560 --> 00:31:20.800]   that the transformation of a caterpillar into a butterfly,
[00:31:20.800 --> 00:31:22.360]   it's an expected outcome.
[00:31:22.360 --> 00:31:27.880]   So we would all be shocked if out of a chrysalis
[00:31:27.880 --> 00:31:29.960]   came a fatter version of the caterpillar.
[00:31:29.960 --> 00:31:34.480]   So this transformation is radical,
[00:31:34.480 --> 00:31:37.160]   and it is unalterable.
[00:31:38.040 --> 00:31:40.840]   And metamorphosis, by definition,
[00:31:40.840 --> 00:31:43.800]   is a change of the form or nature of a creature
[00:31:43.800 --> 00:31:45.400]   into a completely different one.
[00:31:45.400 --> 00:31:50.140]   The Bible teaches us that when a person
[00:31:50.140 --> 00:31:54.600]   who had once been spiritually dead believes upon Christ,
[00:31:54.600 --> 00:31:56.920]   there is a spiritual metamorphosis.
[00:31:56.920 --> 00:32:00.840]   The Christian metamorphosis, too,
[00:32:00.840 --> 00:32:03.540]   can be spiritually observed and confirmed.
[00:32:03.540 --> 00:32:07.560]   The complete transformation of the Christian,
[00:32:07.560 --> 00:32:12.560]   likewise, is miraculous, it's mysterious and radical,
[00:32:12.560 --> 00:32:17.560]   and this also is unalterable, this also is irreversible.
[00:32:17.560 --> 00:32:23.280]   And this transformation, in the same way, is also textbook.
[00:32:23.280 --> 00:32:26.600]   And the metamorphosis of the Christian
[00:32:26.600 --> 00:32:29.120]   is spelled out explicitly in the Bible.
[00:32:29.120 --> 00:32:31.880]   Second Corinthians 5.17 reads,
[00:32:31.880 --> 00:32:36.880]   "Therefore, if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creature."
[00:32:37.600 --> 00:32:42.600]   The old things passed away, behold, new things have come.
[00:32:42.600 --> 00:32:47.880]   So among insects, the metamorphosis can be incomplete,
[00:32:47.880 --> 00:32:50.000]   where the young simply look like wingless,
[00:32:50.000 --> 00:32:52.200]   tiny versions of the adults.
[00:32:52.200 --> 00:32:55.240]   But in Christians, the metamorphosis,
[00:32:55.240 --> 00:32:59.880]   the radical transformation, is always complete.
[00:32:59.880 --> 00:33:05.800]   It is always total, it is always all-encompassing.
[00:33:06.680 --> 00:33:10.320]   The old things are gone, the new things have come.
[00:33:10.320 --> 00:33:13.680]   Hearts of stone have been completely replaced
[00:33:13.680 --> 00:33:15.400]   with tender hearts of flesh.
[00:33:15.400 --> 00:33:19.420]   The satanic has been replaced by the godly.
[00:33:19.420 --> 00:33:24.240]   And those who once were spiritual corpses
[00:33:24.240 --> 00:33:26.740]   change and become living vessels
[00:33:26.740 --> 00:33:29.280]   filled with the very spirit of God,
[00:33:29.280 --> 00:33:31.720]   and walk in newness alive.
[00:33:31.720 --> 00:33:36.160]   So a Christian, by definition, is a new creation,
[00:33:36.160 --> 00:33:40.560]   radically, totally, and irreversibly changed.
[00:33:40.560 --> 00:33:45.660]   There is no such thing as a partial Christian salvation.
[00:33:45.660 --> 00:33:49.560]   Again, this is textbook stuff.
[00:33:49.560 --> 00:33:53.760]   The old has gone, the new has come.
[00:33:53.760 --> 00:33:55.460]   And the Christian's legal standing
[00:33:55.460 --> 00:33:58.600]   before the judgment of God has been instantaneously changed,
[00:33:58.600 --> 00:34:01.420]   and that is what we call justification.
[00:34:01.420 --> 00:34:05.400]   And though the outward, perceivable change
[00:34:05.400 --> 00:34:08.840]   may not be immediately noticeable,
[00:34:08.840 --> 00:34:11.000]   the very DNA of the Christian
[00:34:11.000 --> 00:34:16.000]   is also completely and instantaneously changed upon belief.
[00:34:16.000 --> 00:34:20.060]   That is what we call regeneration.
[00:34:20.060 --> 00:34:23.760]   And it's only a matter of time
[00:34:23.760 --> 00:34:28.760]   that the DNA starts to produce its results.
[00:34:28.760 --> 00:34:30.800]   The passage that I read for you in the beginning,
[00:34:30.800 --> 00:34:33.080]   Galatians 2, 19 to 21,
[00:34:33.080 --> 00:34:34.920]   that's our main text for the morning.
[00:34:34.920 --> 00:34:39.520]   It's a very well-known and very well-memorized passage.
[00:34:39.520 --> 00:34:43.240]   It is a passage we all inductively studied together
[00:34:43.240 --> 00:34:44.400]   back in November.
[00:34:44.400 --> 00:34:47.460]   And we're gonna reflect on this today,
[00:34:47.460 --> 00:34:49.740]   and hopefully it wets our appetites
[00:34:49.740 --> 00:34:51.060]   for part two of Galatians,
[00:34:51.060 --> 00:34:53.680]   which begins in about a week and a half.
[00:34:53.680 --> 00:34:55.000]   So I wanna take a moment to read
[00:34:55.000 --> 00:34:56.960]   these three verses again for us.
[00:34:56.960 --> 00:34:58.960]   Galatians 2, 19 to 21.
[00:34:58.960 --> 00:35:01.520]   For through the law I die to the law,
[00:35:01.520 --> 00:35:04.280]   so that I might live to God.
[00:35:04.280 --> 00:35:06.640]   I have been crucified with Christ,
[00:35:06.640 --> 00:35:09.240]   and it is no longer I who live,
[00:35:09.240 --> 00:35:11.060]   but Christ lives in me.
[00:35:11.060 --> 00:35:13.140]   And the life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:35:13.140 --> 00:35:14.920]   I live by faith in the Son of God,
[00:35:14.920 --> 00:35:17.640]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[00:35:17.640 --> 00:35:20.000]   I do not nullify the grace of God,
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:23.160]   for if righteousness comes through the law,
[00:35:23.160 --> 00:35:25.680]   then Christ died needlessly.
[00:35:25.680 --> 00:35:28.360]   So in these three verses,
[00:35:28.360 --> 00:35:31.440]   the Apostle Paul gives us a snapshot
[00:35:31.440 --> 00:35:34.160]   of the stages of the Christian's metamorphosis.
[00:35:34.160 --> 00:35:38.420]   And we're gonna be looking at this snapshot today.
[00:35:38.420 --> 00:35:41.000]   I'm gonna walk you through these three verses
[00:35:41.000 --> 00:35:44.760]   to explain first why we have been transformed,
[00:35:44.760 --> 00:35:46.600]   so the purpose of our transformation.
[00:35:46.600 --> 00:35:49.920]   And then I'll be describing the means
[00:35:49.920 --> 00:35:52.760]   and the process involved in this transformation.
[00:35:52.760 --> 00:35:56.360]   And then I'll launch off of verse 21
[00:35:56.360 --> 00:35:59.780]   and the overall context of Galatians,
[00:35:59.780 --> 00:36:04.020]   and I'll detail for you what is inferred of the end result,
[00:36:04.020 --> 00:36:07.040]   the end product of our transformation.
[00:36:07.040 --> 00:36:09.840]   Okay, so the purpose of the transformation,
[00:36:09.840 --> 00:36:11.340]   chapter two, verse 19.
[00:36:11.340 --> 00:36:15.880]   The process of the transformation, 20 and 21.
[00:36:15.880 --> 00:36:21.800]   And then the product of the transformation, verse 21.
[00:36:21.800 --> 00:36:24.040]   So I wanna look at Galatians 2, 19 again,
[00:36:24.040 --> 00:36:29.040]   and it reads, "For through the law I died to the law,
[00:36:30.040 --> 00:36:33.000]   "so that I might live to God."
[00:36:33.000 --> 00:36:34.700]   So before we look at the purpose
[00:36:34.700 --> 00:36:37.420]   behind God's transformation of a person,
[00:36:37.420 --> 00:36:39.860]   we need to take a moment to examine
[00:36:39.860 --> 00:36:42.060]   why God had created man to begin with.
[00:36:42.060 --> 00:36:46.540]   Through every cursory reading of the scriptures,
[00:36:46.540 --> 00:36:51.320]   we can easily conclude that you and I have been created
[00:36:51.320 --> 00:36:56.320]   by God and for God to love God and to serve God.
[00:36:58.180 --> 00:37:02.500]   God does not exist for man's happiness or fulfillment.
[00:37:02.500 --> 00:37:07.120]   Man exists for God and not the other way around.
[00:37:07.120 --> 00:37:12.600]   Man was created by God and for God's glory.
[00:37:12.600 --> 00:37:16.780]   And this God, our creator, he is holy.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:22.100]   And to give holy service to God was the original purpose
[00:37:22.100 --> 00:37:24.620]   for which all things have been created.
[00:37:25.540 --> 00:37:27.860]   And all things in this creation
[00:37:27.860 --> 00:37:30.380]   were initially deemed very good.
[00:37:30.380 --> 00:37:33.480]   But we also see through the scriptures
[00:37:33.480 --> 00:37:34.820]   that sin entered the world
[00:37:34.820 --> 00:37:38.660]   and caused every human being born after the fall
[00:37:38.660 --> 00:37:41.400]   to rebel against that purpose
[00:37:41.400 --> 00:37:45.160]   and to commit what R.C. Sproul calls cosmic treason.
[00:37:45.160 --> 00:37:49.180]   So the fallen and natural man
[00:37:49.180 --> 00:37:52.220]   in his fallen and natural condition
[00:37:52.220 --> 00:37:55.300]   is born with a delusional and twisted sense
[00:37:55.300 --> 00:37:56.300]   of entitlement.
[00:37:56.300 --> 00:38:02.180]   And the scripture describes fallen and natural man
[00:38:02.180 --> 00:38:06.180]   as simply an unreasoning creature of instinct
[00:38:06.180 --> 00:38:09.940]   who is blind to sins that separate him from God.
[00:38:09.940 --> 00:38:12.460]   He's a fool.
[00:38:12.460 --> 00:38:16.020]   He is a lover of the temporal.
[00:38:16.020 --> 00:38:18.940]   He is a lover of pleasure.
[00:38:18.940 --> 00:38:21.780]   He is worldly.
[00:38:21.780 --> 00:38:24.620]   He is self-centered.
[00:38:25.420 --> 00:38:27.160]   And he is self-exalting.
[00:38:27.160 --> 00:38:33.700]   And the natural and fallen man is completely oblivious
[00:38:33.700 --> 00:38:35.940]   to the purpose for which he has been created.
[00:38:35.940 --> 00:38:39.480]   The Christian, on the other hand,
[00:38:39.480 --> 00:38:42.460]   is one who has had his eyes opened
[00:38:42.460 --> 00:38:44.300]   to the truth of this rebellion,
[00:38:44.300 --> 00:38:47.520]   his utter depravity,
[00:38:47.520 --> 00:38:52.520]   to his inability to draw near by himself to holy God.
[00:38:53.540 --> 00:38:55.860]   So the beginning of Galatians 2.19 reads,
[00:38:55.860 --> 00:38:59.780]   for through the law, I die to the law,
[00:38:59.780 --> 00:39:02.580]   and we see through the context of Galatians
[00:39:02.580 --> 00:39:05.620]   that that simply means that the Christian
[00:39:05.620 --> 00:39:09.300]   has rejected the notion that he can satisfy
[00:39:09.300 --> 00:39:13.180]   the requirements of God's holy law in and of himself.
[00:39:13.180 --> 00:39:18.160]   So the Christian is one who, by grace,
[00:39:18.160 --> 00:39:19.540]   has come to the realization
[00:39:19.540 --> 00:39:22.500]   that he cannot be reconciled to God
[00:39:22.500 --> 00:39:26.680]   by his own strength or by his own effort.
[00:39:26.680 --> 00:39:30.060]   The Christian is one who has come to understand
[00:39:30.060 --> 00:39:35.060]   that the law and upright living cannot save him,
[00:39:35.060 --> 00:39:40.500]   and that the holy law of God only condemns him.
[00:39:40.500 --> 00:39:44.060]   This Christian is saved by grace alone,
[00:39:44.060 --> 00:39:47.060]   through faith alone, by the sacrifice of Christ alone,
[00:39:47.060 --> 00:39:50.500]   and in that moment of belief,
[00:39:50.500 --> 00:39:52.720]   he is instantly transformed.
[00:39:52.720 --> 00:39:58.380]   And the transformed Christian is one who understands
[00:39:58.380 --> 00:40:03.380]   that the primary purpose in his being saved and transformed
[00:40:03.380 --> 00:40:08.040]   is that he might now be restored to his original purpose.
[00:40:08.040 --> 00:40:13.320]   He has been created by God and for God
[00:40:13.320 --> 00:40:16.620]   to love God and to serve God,
[00:40:16.620 --> 00:40:21.620]   and now he can, and now he must fulfill that purpose.
[00:40:21.620 --> 00:40:28.180]   So the Christian has a zeal for this purpose,
[00:40:28.180 --> 00:40:30.980]   and the fulfillment of his purpose
[00:40:30.980 --> 00:40:33.780]   is now wired into his very DNA.
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:38.800]   He lives to God with a passion and a fervor,
[00:40:38.800 --> 00:40:43.800]   not in order to be saved, but because he is saved.
[00:40:45.340 --> 00:40:48.860]   So Galatians 2:19, "For through the law,
[00:40:48.860 --> 00:40:53.860]   "I die to the law, hinnah, so that I might live to God."
[00:40:53.860 --> 00:40:57.580]   And we covered this before in Bible study,
[00:40:57.580 --> 00:41:00.940]   but the Greek word hinnah is a very important word
[00:41:00.940 --> 00:41:02.820]   in the scriptures.
[00:41:02.820 --> 00:41:04.500]   It is a conjunction word,
[00:41:04.500 --> 00:41:07.740]   translated as in order that or so that.
[00:41:07.740 --> 00:41:11.500]   And it always denotes the reason
[00:41:11.500 --> 00:41:13.200]   or the purpose for something.
[00:41:14.420 --> 00:41:18.540]   The word hinnah or so that always describes
[00:41:18.540 --> 00:41:21.440]   the desired outcome or expectation
[00:41:21.440 --> 00:41:24.700]   to what has just previously been said.
[00:41:24.700 --> 00:41:28.140]   So there is a purpose to a Christian's change
[00:41:28.140 --> 00:41:31.380]   in standing and in nature.
[00:41:31.380 --> 00:41:34.460]   And it reads, "For through the law, I die to the law,
[00:41:34.460 --> 00:41:37.220]   "why, hinnah, I might live to God."
[00:41:37.220 --> 00:41:42.740]   And it's important to pause here and to think deeply
[00:41:42.740 --> 00:41:45.000]   and honestly about a few questions.
[00:41:45.000 --> 00:41:52.700]   Does your life more closely resemble
[00:41:52.700 --> 00:41:58.020]   that of the self-centered, self-exalting,
[00:41:58.020 --> 00:41:59.660]   worldly and fallen man?
[00:41:59.660 --> 00:42:05.780]   Or more of that of the man who now understands
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:08.080]   that the purpose for which he has been created
[00:42:08.080 --> 00:42:11.300]   and the purpose for which he has been saved
[00:42:12.300 --> 00:42:16.640]   and remember the old is gone and the new has come.
[00:42:16.640 --> 00:42:19.360]   Complete transformation.
[00:42:19.360 --> 00:42:22.600]   And as a reminder this morning,
[00:42:22.600 --> 00:42:28.980]   I wanna tell you that we were not saved
[00:42:28.980 --> 00:42:30.440]   simply to escape hell.
[00:42:30.440 --> 00:42:33.780]   Amen?
[00:42:33.780 --> 00:42:40.580]   We were not saved so that we can simply be more moral,
[00:42:40.700 --> 00:42:45.140]   that we can access God's favor and protection in this life,
[00:42:45.140 --> 00:42:50.460]   that we can have this eternal insurance policy
[00:42:50.460 --> 00:42:52.040]   or that we can just make the world
[00:42:52.040 --> 00:42:53.660]   a better place through Jesus.
[00:42:53.660 --> 00:42:55.360]   That's not what we were saved for.
[00:42:55.360 --> 00:42:59.400]   The primary purpose of our lives,
[00:42:59.400 --> 00:43:04.500]   our very creation, our redemption,
[00:43:04.500 --> 00:43:09.920]   and our transformation is hinnah
[00:43:09.920 --> 00:43:13.420]   so that we might live to God.
[00:43:13.420 --> 00:43:16.860]   We are not our own.
[00:43:16.860 --> 00:43:21.300]   We were bought at a price, as it says in 1 Corinthians 6,
[00:43:21.300 --> 00:43:24.060]   and therefore we are to honor God with our lives
[00:43:24.060 --> 00:43:28.740]   and this is the primary purpose of our transformation.
[00:43:28.740 --> 00:43:33.740]   Again, that we might live to God and live fully to God.
[00:43:33.740 --> 00:43:37.580]   As the Westminster Catechism states,
[00:43:37.580 --> 00:43:40.220]   the chief end of man is to glorify God
[00:43:40.220 --> 00:43:42.580]   and to enjoy him forever.
[00:43:42.580 --> 00:43:48.600]   And that forever has already started for the Christian.
[00:43:48.600 --> 00:43:54.820]   So what does that tangibly mean then for the here and now
[00:43:54.820 --> 00:43:57.580]   while we are kind of in this limbo stage?
[00:43:57.580 --> 00:44:02.100]   Let me read Galatians 2, 20 to 21 for you
[00:44:02.100 --> 00:44:04.820]   and this will bring us to our second point,
[00:44:04.820 --> 00:44:07.820]   the process of our transformation.
[00:44:07.820 --> 00:44:10.840]   I have been crucified with Christ
[00:44:10.840 --> 00:44:13.420]   and it is no longer I who live,
[00:44:13.420 --> 00:44:15.780]   but Christ lives in me
[00:44:15.780 --> 00:44:17.860]   and the life which I now live in the flesh,
[00:44:17.860 --> 00:44:20.420]   I live by faith in the Son of God
[00:44:20.420 --> 00:44:23.220]   who loved me and gave himself up for me.
[00:44:23.220 --> 00:44:26.180]   I do not nullify the grace of God.
[00:44:26.180 --> 00:44:31.280]   And the rest of the verse I'll read at the end, okay?
[00:44:31.280 --> 00:44:33.260]   So by the grace of God,
[00:44:34.500 --> 00:44:38.060]   we have seen our desperate need for a savior
[00:44:38.060 --> 00:44:40.620]   and we have cleaved ourselves to Christ
[00:44:40.620 --> 00:44:43.160]   by believing in his name, Acts 4, 12.
[00:44:43.160 --> 00:44:46.580]   And because of belief,
[00:44:46.580 --> 00:44:49.500]   we are now in right standing before God.
[00:44:49.500 --> 00:44:54.080]   Only by belief, amen?
[00:44:54.080 --> 00:44:57.420]   And this is the beginning point
[00:44:57.420 --> 00:44:58.900]   of the transformation process
[00:44:58.900 --> 00:45:00.860]   and it's called justification.
[00:45:02.420 --> 00:45:05.880]   And we know from Romans 8, chapter eight, verse 30,
[00:45:05.880 --> 00:45:08.580]   that those who have been justified
[00:45:08.580 --> 00:45:10.820]   will one day be glorified.
[00:45:10.820 --> 00:45:13.700]   So if you have put your faith in Christ,
[00:45:13.700 --> 00:45:16.340]   you will be glorified.
[00:45:16.340 --> 00:45:20.980]   And this glorification is the final part
[00:45:20.980 --> 00:45:22.660]   of the Christian life cycle.
[00:45:22.660 --> 00:45:26.660]   So broadly put, okay,
[00:45:26.660 --> 00:45:29.380]   from where we are conscious of the changes,
[00:45:29.380 --> 00:45:30.580]   our transformation,
[00:45:32.020 --> 00:45:34.820]   it begins at justification
[00:45:34.820 --> 00:45:38.180]   and it will end with glory, okay?
[00:45:38.180 --> 00:45:42.500]   From where we can perceive the life cycle of the Christian
[00:45:42.500 --> 00:45:45.260]   starts from where we are justified
[00:45:45.260 --> 00:45:47.500]   and ends when we are glorified.
[00:45:47.500 --> 00:45:52.040]   So glorification is what awaits us
[00:45:52.040 --> 00:45:54.580]   in the resurrection and what awaits us in eternity.
[00:45:54.580 --> 00:45:58.380]   This is textbook.
[00:46:00.180 --> 00:46:04.140]   It is mysterious, it is radical,
[00:46:04.140 --> 00:46:09.140]   but at present, you and I who have put our faith in Christ
[00:46:09.140 --> 00:46:13.100]   are in this cocoon-like middle stage
[00:46:13.100 --> 00:46:14.940]   waiting for the final transformation.
[00:46:14.940 --> 00:46:21.020]   And it's an awkward, already but not yet stage.
[00:46:21.020 --> 00:46:24.920]   It's like an engagement period between a man and a woman.
[00:46:24.920 --> 00:46:29.300]   You're kind of one, but you're not.
[00:46:30.260 --> 00:46:35.160]   You've been spoken for and taken, but not fully.
[00:46:35.160 --> 00:46:38.060]   So this in-between stage,
[00:46:38.060 --> 00:46:40.900]   even though it serves an important purpose, right?
[00:46:40.900 --> 00:46:43.340]   The invites need to go out, right?
[00:46:43.340 --> 00:46:46.280]   There are other sheep who are not yet of the fold.
[00:46:46.280 --> 00:46:50.620]   This in-between stage still is a very awkward
[00:46:50.620 --> 00:46:52.700]   and sometimes confusing one
[00:46:52.700 --> 00:46:55.400]   and it is often a very, very painful one.
[00:46:57.220 --> 00:46:59.340]   And on occasion, we may be left wondering
[00:46:59.340 --> 00:47:01.740]   if we indeed have been changed at all
[00:47:01.740 --> 00:47:06.840]   because there is so much old self still remaining.
[00:47:06.840 --> 00:47:12.260]   Many years ago, I had heard that most lizards,
[00:47:12.260 --> 00:47:13.940]   there's a lot of animal talk today, okay?
[00:47:13.940 --> 00:47:18.940]   I had heard that most lizards can self-amputate their tails
[00:47:18.940 --> 00:47:21.620]   to distract predators and to escape.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:23.100]   You guys know this, right?
[00:47:23.100 --> 00:47:26.260]   They go, tail breaks off and then they run, okay?
[00:47:27.260 --> 00:47:28.820]   So I remembered this fact
[00:47:28.820 --> 00:47:32.260]   when I was camping with my friend as a young teenager.
[00:47:32.260 --> 00:47:35.020]   And on day one, the morning,
[00:47:35.020 --> 00:47:37.220]   the first morning of the camping trip,
[00:47:37.220 --> 00:47:40.180]   I noticed a lizard chilling on a rock.
[00:47:40.180 --> 00:47:42.660]   He was basking in the sun.
[00:47:42.660 --> 00:47:44.540]   And purely on the interest of science,
[00:47:44.540 --> 00:47:46.300]   not because I'm cruel, okay?
[00:47:46.300 --> 00:47:48.260]   I kicked the lizard.
[00:47:48.260 --> 00:47:52.600]   I was a lot more agile back then, so I kicked the lizard.
[00:47:52.600 --> 00:47:55.420]   And I wanted to see for myself
[00:47:55.420 --> 00:47:58.540]   whether or not the tail would indeed snap off.
[00:47:58.540 --> 00:47:59.620]   And it did.
[00:47:59.620 --> 00:48:01.820]   Hey, don't judge me, all right?
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:05.620]   And this three-inch severed piece of tail
[00:48:05.620 --> 00:48:09.580]   thrashed and flailed for several minutes.
[00:48:09.580 --> 00:48:13.700]   So moments before I kicked it, in the interest of science,
[00:48:13.700 --> 00:48:15.660]   the tail was dormant,
[00:48:15.660 --> 00:48:18.020]   even though it was connected to the lizard.
[00:48:18.020 --> 00:48:21.220]   But interestingly enough,
[00:48:21.220 --> 00:48:25.380]   upon its detachment from its life source,
[00:48:25.380 --> 00:48:29.140]   it thrashed, it flailed,
[00:48:29.140 --> 00:48:33.020]   and it took on a life of its own, literally.
[00:48:33.020 --> 00:48:35.500]   That tail was dead.
[00:48:35.500 --> 00:48:37.340]   It was cut off from its source of life,
[00:48:37.340 --> 00:48:38.820]   but it was still dying.
[00:48:38.820 --> 00:48:42.020]   It was both dead and still dying.
[00:48:42.020 --> 00:48:48.900]   Sometimes, we who have been transformed completely
[00:48:48.900 --> 00:48:54.340]   still feel like that transformation is incomplete.
[00:48:55.340 --> 00:48:58.220]   We are one with Christ,
[00:48:58.220 --> 00:49:01.260]   but sometimes we feel so distant from him.
[00:49:01.260 --> 00:49:07.500]   We have been permanently and irreversibly changed,
[00:49:07.500 --> 00:49:10.780]   but the old residue of our old self,
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:13.660]   it's still very stubbornly present.
[00:49:13.660 --> 00:49:20.980]   Why do I still struggle so much to remember my purpose,
[00:49:22.660 --> 00:49:27.100]   to live a life consistent with my transformed nature?
[00:49:27.100 --> 00:49:29.580]   It's frustrating.
[00:49:29.580 --> 00:49:36.180]   Well, it's because sin, though it is dead in me,
[00:49:36.180 --> 00:49:38.500]   it's still dying in me.
[00:49:38.500 --> 00:49:42.500]   It's both an already and a not yet.
[00:49:42.500 --> 00:49:48.980]   So if we have believed upon Christ, we have been changed,
[00:49:48.980 --> 00:49:51.580]   but we are still being changed.
[00:49:51.580 --> 00:49:55.740]   We have been transformed, but God is still transforming us
[00:49:55.740 --> 00:49:58.060]   and conforming us to the image of his son.
[00:49:58.060 --> 00:50:02.420]   We have been united with Christ in his death,
[00:50:02.420 --> 00:50:07.420]   but we are still being united with Christ in his death.
[00:50:07.420 --> 00:50:13.540]   And this process, which we call sanctification,
[00:50:13.540 --> 00:50:17.820]   is currently the stage in which we find ourselves.
[00:50:19.860 --> 00:50:22.580]   We have been crucified with Christ,
[00:50:22.580 --> 00:50:26.540]   but we are still living life in the flesh.
[00:50:26.540 --> 00:50:30.260]   So this life we are living in the flesh,
[00:50:30.260 --> 00:50:31.900]   while we are waiting for glory,
[00:50:31.900 --> 00:50:33.820]   we live by faith in the son of God
[00:50:33.820 --> 00:50:37.180]   who loved us and gave himself for us.
[00:50:37.180 --> 00:50:39.900]   We have been crucified with Christ,
[00:50:39.900 --> 00:50:44.100]   and we are still, figuratively speaking, hanging there.
[00:50:45.860 --> 00:50:50.580]   And we are persevering in our hanging by faith.
[00:50:50.580 --> 00:50:55.060]   And I wanna point our attention to the first few words
[00:50:55.060 --> 00:50:56.820]   in Galatians 2.20, okay?
[00:50:56.820 --> 00:51:00.140]   One of the most well-read passages in the Bible.
[00:51:00.140 --> 00:51:04.060]   Hopefully you catch this, okay?
[00:51:04.060 --> 00:51:09.060]   I have been crucified with Christ, and I no longer live.
[00:51:11.900 --> 00:51:16.580]   The verb susterao, I have been crucified,
[00:51:16.580 --> 00:51:19.620]   is significant for two reasons.
[00:51:19.620 --> 00:51:23.500]   It's in the present perfect tense,
[00:51:23.500 --> 00:51:26.300]   and it is a passive verb.
[00:51:26.300 --> 00:51:28.660]   Why is that significant?
[00:51:28.660 --> 00:51:34.300]   The present perfect tense is used for past actions
[00:51:34.300 --> 00:51:38.420]   that are related to or continue on in the present.
[00:51:39.580 --> 00:51:42.860]   So we are still crucified with Christ.
[00:51:42.860 --> 00:51:45.180]   It is ongoing.
[00:51:45.180 --> 00:51:47.060]   Make sense?
[00:51:47.060 --> 00:51:50.500]   Secondly, it's in the passive.
[00:51:50.500 --> 00:51:56.220]   This is something that was done to us
[00:51:56.220 --> 00:51:59.700]   and is continuing to be done to us.
[00:51:59.700 --> 00:52:04.980]   So just as no one can physically crucify himself,
[00:52:04.980 --> 00:52:08.060]   if I were to ask you,
[00:52:08.060 --> 00:52:10.020]   "Can you crucify yourself to a cross?"
[00:52:10.020 --> 00:52:11.460]   You couldn't.
[00:52:11.460 --> 00:52:12.860]   You don't have enough hands.
[00:52:12.860 --> 00:52:18.220]   Just as no one can physically crucify himself,
[00:52:18.220 --> 00:52:22.740]   neither can we spiritually crucify ourselves with Christ.
[00:52:22.740 --> 00:52:29.020]   Our past and ongoing crucifixion, our sanctification,
[00:52:29.020 --> 00:52:32.580]   it was initiated by God,
[00:52:32.580 --> 00:52:35.860]   and it is ongoing because it is God's will
[00:52:35.860 --> 00:52:37.820]   for our earthly lives.
[00:52:38.820 --> 00:52:43.060]   So our sanctification is God's will.
[00:52:43.060 --> 00:52:47.940]   It is part of his good and pleasing and perfect will.
[00:52:47.940 --> 00:52:51.100]   If you agree with that and know that as truth, say amen.
[00:52:51.100 --> 00:52:55.380]   1 Thessalonians 4:3,
[00:52:55.380 --> 00:53:00.380]   "For this is the will of God, your sanctification."
[00:53:03.340 --> 00:53:08.340]   Secondly, sanctification is a prerequisite
[00:53:08.340 --> 00:53:11.220]   to seeing God face-to-face.
[00:53:11.220 --> 00:53:14.860]   In Hebrews chapter 12,
[00:53:14.860 --> 00:53:18.740]   after the writer says that God disciplines the Christian
[00:53:18.740 --> 00:53:23.180]   in the way that a loving father would discipline his child,
[00:53:23.180 --> 00:53:28.620]   he talks about the need for the sanctification
[00:53:28.620 --> 00:53:31.020]   to be embraced and almost pursued
[00:53:31.940 --> 00:53:34.020]   by the beloved children of God.
[00:53:34.020 --> 00:53:36.780]   So I wanna read Hebrews 12, 14.
[00:53:36.780 --> 00:53:41.780]   "Pursue peace with all men and pursue the sanctification,
[00:53:41.780 --> 00:53:46.940]   "without which no one will see the Lord."
[00:53:46.940 --> 00:53:50.420]   So our sanctification is God's will.
[00:53:50.420 --> 00:53:55.420]   Our sanctification is a prerequisite to seeing the Lord.
[00:53:57.580 --> 00:54:02.580]   And our sanctification is the very purpose
[00:54:02.580 --> 00:54:05.380]   for Jesus' sacrificing of himself.
[00:54:05.380 --> 00:54:09.220]   Hebrews 10, 14.
[00:54:09.220 --> 00:54:14.220]   "For by one offering, he has perfected for all time
[00:54:14.220 --> 00:54:17.620]   "those who are sanctified."
[00:54:17.620 --> 00:54:23.380]   So this life we are living in the flesh is a crucified life.
[00:54:24.620 --> 00:54:26.900]   And it will continue to be a crucified life.
[00:54:26.900 --> 00:54:31.860]   When does a crucified man get off the cross?
[00:54:31.860 --> 00:54:35.260]   Think about this.
[00:54:35.260 --> 00:54:41.020]   When does a crucified man get off the cross?
[00:54:41.020 --> 00:54:44.900]   Only after he is completely dead.
[00:54:44.900 --> 00:54:50.540]   So imagine for a moment with me
[00:54:50.540 --> 00:54:54.460]   what it is like to be crucified.
[00:54:54.460 --> 00:54:57.300]   (markers tapping)
[00:54:57.300 --> 00:54:59.980]   Is it comfortable?
[00:54:59.980 --> 00:55:05.820]   Okay, imagine with me.
[00:55:05.820 --> 00:55:11.860]   Is there a way somehow to adjust the position of your body
[00:55:11.860 --> 00:55:17.780]   to make it less uncomfortable and perhaps more tolerable?
[00:55:17.780 --> 00:55:23.780]   With each passing hour hanging there,
[00:55:23.780 --> 00:55:26.500]   stripped, naked, and bloodied,
[00:55:26.500 --> 00:55:29.100]   do you think that you get used to it?
[00:55:29.100 --> 00:55:33.020]   Or do you think that you would feel the pain
[00:55:33.020 --> 00:55:36.500]   with greater intensity as you try to keep your lungs
[00:55:36.500 --> 00:55:41.500]   from collapsing by just pushing against those nails?
[00:55:41.500 --> 00:55:46.500]   In that crucified moment,
[00:55:46.500 --> 00:55:51.780]   wouldn't you just prefer it to all just end quickly?
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.940]   (markers tapping)
[00:55:53.940 --> 00:55:57.500]   Would not death be better by far?
[00:55:57.500 --> 00:56:00.540]   Would not death be gain?
[00:56:00.540 --> 00:56:08.700]   The ongoing crucifixion of the old self.
[00:56:08.700 --> 00:56:14.740]   This is the Christian's primary proclamation.
[00:56:14.740 --> 00:56:19.260]   This is the Christian's boast.
[00:56:21.060 --> 00:56:24.820]   This is the Christian's only boast.
[00:56:24.820 --> 00:56:30.500]   And that too, brothers and sisters, is textbook.
[00:56:30.500 --> 00:56:33.620]   Galatians 6, 14.
[00:56:33.620 --> 00:56:40.220]   But may it never be that I would boast
[00:56:40.220 --> 00:56:44.820]   except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[00:56:48.700 --> 00:56:50.980]   May it be that I would never,
[00:56:50.980 --> 00:56:52.900]   may it never be that I will boast
[00:56:52.900 --> 00:56:56.900]   except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ
[00:56:56.900 --> 00:57:01.380]   through which the world has been crucified to me
[00:57:01.380 --> 00:57:03.980]   and I to the world.
[00:57:03.980 --> 00:57:06.780]   It's a very strange thing for a Christian
[00:57:06.780 --> 00:57:10.580]   to find this cursed world
[00:57:10.580 --> 00:57:15.340]   to be a very, very comfortable place.
[00:57:17.460 --> 00:57:19.140]   Nod your heads if you're tracking.
[00:57:19.140 --> 00:57:25.260]   It is a very, very strange thing
[00:57:25.260 --> 00:57:28.060]   for a Christian whose very identity
[00:57:28.060 --> 00:57:30.300]   is being crucified with Christ
[00:57:30.300 --> 00:57:35.300]   to find this world to be a very comfortable place
[00:57:35.300 --> 00:57:39.180]   and to try to wiggle into a posture
[00:57:39.180 --> 00:57:42.340]   where it actually becomes more pleasurable,
[00:57:42.340 --> 00:57:46.780]   more secure, more fulfilling.
[00:57:47.620 --> 00:57:52.620]   It's a frightening thing for a Christian
[00:57:52.620 --> 00:58:00.460]   to be in love with the things in this world.
[00:58:00.460 --> 00:58:06.620]   Here's a mini litmus test.
[00:58:06.620 --> 00:58:11.860]   If you were to think of the Christian life as a ship,
[00:58:11.860 --> 00:58:16.620]   what kind of ship would this life be
[00:58:16.620 --> 00:58:19.020]   in your mind and in your future?
[00:58:19.020 --> 00:58:23.420]   Is it a luxury cruise ship
[00:58:23.420 --> 00:58:27.820]   where Christ has purchased a first-class seat for you?
[00:58:27.820 --> 00:58:32.420]   Or is it more of a battleship
[00:58:32.420 --> 00:58:35.540]   or a lifeboat
[00:58:35.540 --> 00:58:39.860]   on which Christ is at the captain's seat?
[00:58:39.860 --> 00:58:45.860]   This is very, this is something very sobering for us
[00:58:45.860 --> 00:58:48.740]   to think about while we are crucified Christians
[00:58:48.740 --> 00:58:50.100]   living in Orange County.
[00:58:50.100 --> 00:58:55.580]   It is a very, very strange thing,
[00:58:55.580 --> 00:58:59.500]   almost a blasphemous thing for a Christian
[00:58:59.500 --> 00:59:02.020]   to find this world
[00:59:02.020 --> 00:59:05.740]   pleasing and comfortable.
[00:59:05.740 --> 00:59:10.060]   First John 2:15,
[00:59:10.060 --> 00:59:14.740]   do not love the world nor the things in the world
[00:59:14.740 --> 00:59:16.620]   if anyone loves the world.
[00:59:16.620 --> 00:59:19.060]   The love of the Father is not in him.
[00:59:19.060 --> 00:59:22.660]   Do not love the world nor the things in the world
[00:59:22.660 --> 00:59:24.300]   if anyone loves the world.
[00:59:24.300 --> 00:59:26.260]   The love of the Father is not in him.
[00:59:26.260 --> 00:59:29.100]   If anyone loves the world,
[00:59:29.100 --> 00:59:32.820]   the love of the Father is not in him.
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:43.180]   This observable evidence of your metamorphosis
[00:59:44.020 --> 00:59:49.020]   cannot but be like a growing dissatisfaction
[00:59:49.020 --> 00:59:51.300]   with the things of the world.
[00:59:51.300 --> 00:59:55.860]   I believe that love, joy, peace, and patience,
[00:59:55.860 --> 00:59:57.780]   they will increase in the Christian life
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.180]   with each passing year.
[00:59:59.180 --> 01:00:02.700]   But I also believe that the pain and discomfort
[01:00:02.700 --> 01:00:05.060]   in this crucified Christian life
[01:00:05.060 --> 01:00:07.900]   also increases with each passing year.
[01:00:07.900 --> 01:00:12.940]   The initial moment of crucifixion, okay,
[01:00:12.940 --> 01:00:14.500]   keep imagining with me,
[01:00:14.500 --> 01:00:18.100]   where the giant nails penetrate through your bones
[01:00:18.100 --> 01:00:19.780]   onto the wooden beams,
[01:00:19.780 --> 01:00:22.340]   I would imagine that to be very painful.
[01:00:22.340 --> 01:00:28.220]   But the process of hanging there
[01:00:28.220 --> 01:00:31.060]   with the entire weight of your body
[01:00:31.060 --> 01:00:33.860]   being held up only by your torn flesh
[01:00:33.860 --> 01:00:36.220]   and your broken bones,
[01:00:36.220 --> 01:00:40.820]   I would imagine it to be even more excruciating,
[01:00:40.820 --> 01:00:42.500]   unbearable pain.
[01:00:43.500 --> 01:00:48.500]   The hanging is more painful than the initial nailing.
[01:00:48.500 --> 01:00:53.300]   In the ancient world,
[01:00:53.300 --> 01:00:56.180]   a spear to the side of the crucified man
[01:00:56.180 --> 01:00:59.740]   was considered an act of kindness and mercy
[01:00:59.740 --> 01:01:03.940]   because the process of slowly dying on a cross
[01:01:03.940 --> 01:01:05.500]   was pure torture.
[01:01:05.500 --> 01:01:08.540]   The spear ended the suffering.
[01:01:10.260 --> 01:01:12.980]   Oftentimes, when a person is first saved,
[01:01:12.980 --> 01:01:15.540]   a lot of the surface-level sins
[01:01:15.540 --> 01:01:18.700]   get immediately purged out of the person's life.
[01:01:18.700 --> 01:01:20.100]   They gush out.
[01:01:20.100 --> 01:01:24.540]   A lot of immediate changes take place in the lives
[01:01:24.540 --> 01:01:27.300]   and in the hearts of new believers.
[01:01:27.300 --> 01:01:31.740]   But the fallen nature of rebellious fallen man,
[01:01:31.740 --> 01:01:33.660]   it runs super deep.
[01:01:33.660 --> 01:01:36.620]   It's deep inside the core,
[01:01:36.620 --> 01:01:40.180]   so the residual effects of the rebellion
[01:01:40.180 --> 01:01:43.420]   it takes a while to bleed out.
[01:01:43.420 --> 01:01:48.220]   The initial shock of the nails can be painful,
[01:01:48.220 --> 01:01:53.020]   but the agony of the ongoing bleeding out of our sins
[01:01:53.020 --> 01:01:56.140]   is likely even more shocking and more painful.
[01:01:56.140 --> 01:02:01.140]   So if you are like, "What is wrong with me?
[01:02:01.140 --> 01:02:06.980]   "Why am I not holy enough yet?
[01:02:07.940 --> 01:02:12.300]   "Why is there so much rebellion in me?"
[01:02:12.300 --> 01:02:14.020]   Praise God that that's his grace
[01:02:14.020 --> 01:02:15.500]   revealing those things to you.
[01:02:15.500 --> 01:02:21.060]   God hates all sins.
[01:02:21.060 --> 01:02:23.500]   But you know what sins are at the top?
[01:02:23.500 --> 01:02:26.060]   Proverbs 8:13 gives us a little bit of an insight.
[01:02:26.060 --> 01:02:29.540]   "The fear of the Lord is to hate evil.
[01:02:29.540 --> 01:02:31.020]   "Pride and arrogance and the evil way
[01:02:31.020 --> 01:02:32.620]   "and the perverted mouth I hate."
[01:02:32.620 --> 01:02:34.500]   You notice what's not on the list?
[01:02:34.500 --> 01:02:37.980]   Sexual sin, addictions and drunkenness,
[01:02:37.980 --> 01:02:43.340]   embezzlement, stealing, cheating on your taxes.
[01:02:43.340 --> 01:02:46.500]   That's not on this list, although God hates those things.
[01:02:46.500 --> 01:02:50.620]   More than drunkenness, more than sexual sins,
[01:02:50.620 --> 01:02:54.420]   more than theft, God hates pride.
[01:02:54.420 --> 01:03:01.020]   And if you are his child, he is going to kill your pride.
[01:03:04.180 --> 01:03:05.900]   Are there things that are happening in your life
[01:03:05.900 --> 01:03:10.140]   to expose and rid you of your self-reliance,
[01:03:10.140 --> 01:03:15.140]   your insecurities, your arrogance, your deception,
[01:03:15.140 --> 01:03:20.220]   your self-sufficiency, your self-exalting motivations?
[01:03:20.220 --> 01:03:25.140]   Are you realizing more and more that you're disgusting?
[01:03:25.140 --> 01:03:29.020]   Are you being humiliated?
[01:03:31.540 --> 01:03:36.180]   Perhaps the Lord, in his love, is putting your pride
[01:03:36.180 --> 01:03:39.380]   to death because he loves you,
[01:03:39.380 --> 01:03:43.660]   not because he just wants to shame you.
[01:03:43.660 --> 01:03:51.460]   You know why he sometimes allows you to be frustrated
[01:03:51.460 --> 01:03:53.700]   with the things of this world?
[01:03:53.700 --> 01:03:57.940]   Because he is weaning you off this world.
[01:03:59.340 --> 01:04:03.860]   He is emptying you of everything that needs to be emptied
[01:04:03.860 --> 01:04:07.060]   in order to fill every part of you
[01:04:07.060 --> 01:04:08.860]   with the righteousness of Christ.
[01:04:08.860 --> 01:04:11.460]   Amen?
[01:04:11.460 --> 01:04:18.700]   So it's only normal for the crucified man
[01:04:18.700 --> 01:04:24.540]   to increase in agony and long for heaven.
[01:04:25.540 --> 01:04:26.380]   For heaven.
[01:04:26.380 --> 01:04:32.420]   I'm going to keep this last point brief.
[01:04:32.420 --> 01:04:39.260]   What is the final product of the metamorphosis?
[01:04:39.260 --> 01:04:41.220]   Okay, Galatians 2.21.
[01:04:41.220 --> 01:04:42.980]   I do not nullify the grace of God,
[01:04:42.980 --> 01:04:45.820]   for if righteousness comes through the law,
[01:04:45.820 --> 01:04:48.620]   then Christ died needlessly.
[01:04:48.620 --> 01:04:51.540]   Righteousness.
[01:04:53.180 --> 01:04:55.180]   The end product of the transformation of the Christian
[01:04:55.180 --> 01:04:59.460]   is perfect and eternal righteousness.
[01:04:59.460 --> 01:05:01.700]   The perfect righteousness of Jesus Christ
[01:05:01.700 --> 01:05:03.660]   is what we will be clothed with.
[01:05:03.660 --> 01:05:09.900]   And Psalm 117 gives us a little preview of what awaits.
[01:05:09.900 --> 01:05:12.820]   For the Lord is righteous.
[01:05:12.820 --> 01:05:15.540]   He loves righteousness.
[01:05:15.540 --> 01:05:18.740]   The upright will behold his face.
[01:05:22.900 --> 01:05:23.740]   I have shared with you
[01:05:23.740 --> 01:05:26.260]   that the end of the Christian metamorphosis is glory.
[01:05:26.260 --> 01:05:29.460]   And what awaits in our glorification,
[01:05:29.460 --> 01:05:34.060]   no man at present can accurately describe in words.
[01:05:34.060 --> 01:05:40.820]   No eye has seen it, no ear has heard it,
[01:05:40.820 --> 01:05:47.620]   no mind has conceived of the glorious things
[01:05:49.020 --> 01:05:53.660]   which he has prepared for the glorified Christian.
[01:05:53.660 --> 01:06:00.260]   The co-heir of Christ who has been already
[01:06:00.260 --> 01:06:03.020]   and will be seated in the heavenly places
[01:06:03.020 --> 01:06:06.300]   with Christ, Ephesians 2.7.
[01:06:06.300 --> 01:06:07.140]   Six and seven.
[01:06:07.140 --> 01:06:13.620]   So we don't know what awaits us fully.
[01:06:13.620 --> 01:06:18.220]   But the Bible tells us it's beyond imagination.
[01:06:18.860 --> 01:06:21.860]   (audience laughing)
[01:06:21.860 --> 01:06:24.940]   By way of application,
[01:06:24.940 --> 01:06:28.660]   I'll leave you with a hope-filled passage
[01:06:28.660 --> 01:06:29.860]   detailing what awaits us.
[01:06:29.860 --> 01:06:32.460]   Because in Galatians, there is no command,
[01:06:32.460 --> 01:06:36.140]   no imperative, no application until chapter five, okay?
[01:06:36.140 --> 01:06:41.140]   So I'm just gonna leave you with a passage,
[01:06:41.140 --> 01:06:45.500]   hopefully, that while you're hanging on for dear death,
[01:06:47.260 --> 01:06:48.220]   you can persevere.
[01:06:48.220 --> 01:06:50.860]   First John three, two to three.
[01:06:50.860 --> 01:06:55.460]   Beloved, now we are children of God
[01:06:55.460 --> 01:06:59.500]   and it has not appeared as yet what we will be.
[01:06:59.500 --> 01:07:02.860]   But we know that when he appears,
[01:07:02.860 --> 01:07:07.860]   we will be like him because we will see him just as he is.
[01:07:07.860 --> 01:07:10.620]   (pages rustling)
[01:07:10.620 --> 01:07:20.420]   We will be like him
[01:07:20.420 --> 01:07:30.820]   because we will see him just as he is.
[01:07:34.500 --> 01:07:39.380]   And everyone who has this hope fixed on him
[01:07:39.380 --> 01:07:43.860]   purifies himself just as he is pure.
[01:07:43.860 --> 01:07:51.980]   So the only application is keep hanging there.
[01:07:51.980 --> 01:08:01.100]   Persevere in your hanging by faith.
[01:08:03.380 --> 01:08:05.300]   The life that you now live in the flesh,
[01:08:05.300 --> 01:08:10.300]   you live by faith in the son of God who loved you
[01:08:10.300 --> 01:08:13.900]   and gave himself up for you.
[01:08:13.900 --> 01:08:18.820]   If you have been transformed,
[01:08:18.820 --> 01:08:24.980]   if your home is not here,
[01:08:24.980 --> 01:08:31.540]   if indeed you are waiting for the resurrection
[01:08:31.540 --> 01:08:34.220]   and the return of Christ, persevere.
[01:08:34.220 --> 01:08:46.860]   My hope in this life, my expectations for this life,
[01:08:46.860 --> 01:08:51.860]   my love for this world are supposed to be wasting away
[01:08:58.780 --> 01:09:03.780]   because I'm a new creature with a new DNA
[01:09:03.780 --> 01:09:09.620]   longing for a new permanent address
[01:09:09.620 --> 01:09:12.700]   to be at home with the Lord.
[01:09:12.700 --> 01:09:16.500]   Persevere.
[01:09:16.500 --> 01:09:24.460]   And remember that the weaning off of this world is normal.
[01:09:28.300 --> 01:09:29.740]   Amen.
[01:09:29.740 --> 01:09:30.580]   Let's pray.
[01:09:30.580 --> 01:09:42.100]   Father, help us to exalt in our humiliation.
[01:09:42.100 --> 01:09:46.620]   Lord, you've said in James 1
[01:09:46.620 --> 01:09:51.620]   that the rich man is to glory in his humiliation
[01:09:51.620 --> 01:09:54.900]   because like the flowering grass, we will fade away.
[01:09:57.060 --> 01:10:00.820]   So as you're stripping us of our affections for this world,
[01:10:00.820 --> 01:10:03.620]   I pray that you would replace them fully
[01:10:03.620 --> 01:10:06.620]   with a great affection for Jesus Christ.
[01:10:06.620 --> 01:10:10.340]   For that is our purpose and that is our joy.
[01:10:10.340 --> 01:10:13.540]   We love you, Lord, and pray this in Jesus' name.
[01:10:13.540 --> 01:10:18.860]   - Let us rise as we sing our closing praise.
[01:10:18.860 --> 01:10:21.780]   (soft piano music)

[01:27:53.580 --> 01:27:54.420]   Okay, for sure.
[01:27:54.420 --> 01:27:59.520]   So yeah, as instruments, we'll all follow suit with that.

[01:28:03.460 --> 01:28:06.420]   - Well, it's funny, 'cause it's like all the way

[01:28:08.020 --> 01:28:10.500]   but I realized while he was up here giving an essence
[01:28:10.500 --> 01:28:11.940]   that I had to play for offering.
[01:28:11.940 --> 01:28:12.780]   - Oh, yeah.
[01:28:12.780 --> 01:28:14.860]   - And it would have just been 100% patting.
