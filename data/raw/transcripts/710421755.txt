[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:07.000]   - Hi, my name is Chauan.
[00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.000]   Can you guys hear me?
[00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.000]   It's good.
[00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.240]   My name is Chauan, and I'll be giving my testimony today.
[00:00:13.240 --> 00:00:17.920]   So I was born in Illinois and moved around a couple times growing up.
[00:00:17.920 --> 00:00:22.680]   And despite the moves, I was always surrounded by a loving family that provided for me and
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:25.040]   strived to bring me up in the faith.
[00:00:25.040 --> 00:00:28.840]   We went to church on Sunday, and the importance of my relationship with Christ was always
[00:00:28.840 --> 00:00:30.480]   stressed to me.
[00:00:30.480 --> 00:00:35.080]   But growing up, I didn't really enjoy going to church, doing devotionals or meeting up
[00:00:35.080 --> 00:00:36.840]   for small groups.
[00:00:36.840 --> 00:00:40.840]   Christianity felt like a chore, like a long to-do list.
[00:00:40.840 --> 00:00:45.000]   And for the early parts of my life, my faith was really driven by fear, fear that I didn't
[00:00:45.000 --> 00:00:47.960]   do enough stuff or didn't like Christianity.
[00:00:47.960 --> 00:00:51.600]   And if I didn't do enough stuff or I didn't like Christianity enough, I was pretty much
[00:00:51.600 --> 00:00:52.600]   doomed.
[00:00:52.600 --> 00:00:57.040]   And things carried on like this until I moved to California in middle school.
[00:00:57.040 --> 00:00:59.880]   My family joined a church that I found really fun.
[00:00:59.880 --> 00:01:04.520]   I made lots of friends, and the desire to see them and socialize with them drove me
[00:01:04.520 --> 00:01:05.800]   to go to church.
[00:01:05.800 --> 00:01:09.920]   I was excited to go to church every Sunday, excited to help out at church events and do
[00:01:09.920 --> 00:01:12.940]   all the things I thought a Christian was supposed to do.
[00:01:12.940 --> 00:01:16.440]   I was excited by this change in heart and thought that I was finally acting like what
[00:01:16.440 --> 00:01:18.960]   I thought a true Christian should act like.
[00:01:18.960 --> 00:01:23.640]   Unfortunately, I was under the impression that my acts alone made me a true Christian.
[00:01:23.640 --> 00:01:27.280]   And even worse, my motivation to act like a Christian was driven by the fun I was having
[00:01:27.280 --> 00:01:28.880]   at this new church.
[00:01:28.880 --> 00:01:33.480]   And looking back, it's apparent I still didn't fully understand Christianity.
[00:01:33.480 --> 00:01:37.440]   Fast forward to my sophomore year in high school, and I nearly died.
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:40.760]   I was playing basketball for my high school and went into full cardiac arrest.
[00:01:40.760 --> 00:01:45.980]   Thankfully, I was resuscitated with an AED and was rushed to the hospital where doctors
[00:01:45.980 --> 00:01:51.600]   informed my family and myself that I'd actually been born with a congenital heart defect.
[00:01:51.600 --> 00:01:56.720]   My heart hadn't developed correctly and doctors recommended I undergo open heart surgery.
[00:01:56.720 --> 00:02:01.600]   Immediately I was filled with fear, fear of death, fear that surgery could go wrong.
[00:02:01.600 --> 00:02:05.520]   And in the midst of my fear, I kept asking God, "What did I do to deserve this?
[00:02:05.520 --> 00:02:09.840]   I've been doing everything right, or I thought I was doing everything right, so why did this
[00:02:09.840 --> 00:02:12.120]   happen to me?"
[00:02:12.120 --> 00:02:15.240]   Obviously surgery went well because I'm here today.
[00:02:15.240 --> 00:02:17.920]   But following that event, those questions still lingered.
[00:02:17.920 --> 00:02:22.080]   I was thankful to God that he had brought me through such a serious event, but continued
[00:02:22.080 --> 00:02:25.920]   to wonder what I did that could have caused it to happen.
[00:02:25.920 --> 00:02:29.360]   I thought that after such a life-altering experience, my life would change.
[00:02:29.360 --> 00:02:34.080]   I'd be imbibed with a will to do all the things I was supposed to do as a Christian.
[00:02:34.080 --> 00:02:35.440]   And yet it didn't happen.
[00:02:35.440 --> 00:02:39.840]   When church wasn't fun anymore, my desire to serve dissipated and my desire to see Christ
[00:02:39.840 --> 00:02:42.720]   dissipated as well.
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:44.920]   Going into college, I carried the same questions and doubts.
[00:02:44.920 --> 00:02:48.840]   I knew I wouldn't have survived if it weren't for God's sovereignty and blessing, but I
[00:02:48.840 --> 00:02:54.360]   continued to believe that I had a part to play, that I was more significant than Christ.
[00:02:54.360 --> 00:02:59.760]   It wasn't until I attended Grace Community Church at UCLA and Berean here that things
[00:02:59.760 --> 00:03:01.160]   really did change.
[00:03:01.160 --> 00:03:04.320]   It was at these churches that I really learned my depravity.
[00:03:04.320 --> 00:03:09.040]   No matter how hard I tried, no matter what I did, I could do nothing to get any closer
[00:03:09.040 --> 00:03:10.040]   to Christ.
[00:03:10.040 --> 00:03:14.320]   And thankfully, we have a God whose love never ceases, and I'm so grateful for the resurrection
[00:03:14.320 --> 00:03:16.520]   and Christ's sacrifice.
[00:03:16.520 --> 00:03:21.440]   I found a new comfort and hope in knowing that even in my sin, my life is in God's hands
[00:03:21.440 --> 00:03:23.520]   and his plan is perfect.
[00:03:23.520 --> 00:03:26.760]   Looking back, I realized that there was nothing I could have done to prevent what happened
[00:03:26.760 --> 00:03:32.360]   to me, but God was using my struggle to show me how much I needed to depend on him.
[00:03:32.360 --> 00:03:37.520]   Now I understand I'll never be a good Christian, that I need Christ because on my own, I am
[00:03:37.520 --> 00:03:38.520]   nothing.
[00:03:38.520 --> 00:03:42.400]   I want to seek him because I am destitute if I were to try and do anything on my own.
[00:03:42.400 --> 00:03:45.960]   My life is not my own, and because of that, it is absolutely necessary for me to give
[00:03:45.960 --> 00:03:54.960]   my life to Christ and pursue him with everything that I have.
[00:03:54.960 --> 00:04:00.440]   Thank you.
[00:04:00.440 --> 00:04:24.440]   [ Inaudible ]
