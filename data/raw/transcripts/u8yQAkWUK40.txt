[00:15:18.780 --> 00:15:22.780]   - Church family, let's go ahead and pray together
[00:15:22.780 --> 00:15:24.780]   as we come before God.
[00:15:26.780 --> 00:15:29.780]   Gracious God, we thank you for tonight.
[00:15:29.780 --> 00:15:34.780]   We desire, Lord God, to humble ourselves
[00:15:34.780 --> 00:15:38.780]   as we approach a holy, holy, holy God,
[00:15:38.780 --> 00:15:42.780]   that we come with reverence, we come with awe,
[00:15:42.780 --> 00:15:45.780]   and we come, Lord God, with joy
[00:15:45.780 --> 00:15:49.780]   because we have been reconciled by the blood of Christ.
[00:15:49.780 --> 00:15:54.780]   As we spend time today singing,
[00:15:55.780 --> 00:15:59.780]   as we spend time praying for ourselves,
[00:15:59.780 --> 00:16:01.780]   for others around us,
[00:16:01.780 --> 00:16:06.780]   Lord, we ask for softened hearts.
[00:16:06.780 --> 00:16:11.780]   We ask for a perspective, Lord,
[00:16:11.780 --> 00:16:16.780]   that we have very limited control of things around us.
[00:16:16.780 --> 00:16:21.780]   So I pray, Lord God, that you give us the right perspective,
[00:16:21.780 --> 00:16:24.780]   that you are God and we are not.
[00:16:24.780 --> 00:16:27.780]   I pray, Lord God, that our hearts may be filled
[00:16:27.780 --> 00:16:32.780]   with a continuing knowledge of who we serve,
[00:16:32.780 --> 00:16:35.780]   who we give adoration to.
[00:16:35.780 --> 00:16:40.780]   So I pray that this night may be a night filled with joy
[00:16:40.780 --> 00:16:45.780]   as well as remembrance of the grace that we get.
[00:16:45.780 --> 00:16:48.780]   So I pray for everyone here
[00:16:49.780 --> 00:16:52.780]   that we may be eager, focused,
[00:16:52.780 --> 00:16:56.780]   and motivated to honor you with our lips,
[00:16:56.780 --> 00:16:59.780]   with our hearts, with everything.
[00:16:59.780 --> 00:17:02.780]   So we thank you, Lord God, for the time that you give
[00:17:02.780 --> 00:17:04.780]   for us to gather as a corporate body of Christ.
[00:17:04.780 --> 00:17:08.780]   May it be a blessing, may it be sweet,
[00:17:08.780 --> 00:17:11.780]   may it ultimately bring you joy.
[00:17:11.780 --> 00:17:13.780]   It's in Christ and we pray, amen.
[00:17:13.780 --> 00:17:16.780]   Church family, why don't we stand together?
[00:17:16.780 --> 00:17:18.780]   So we're gonna change up a little bit of the format

[00:17:23.780 --> 00:17:26.780]   and then we'll transition into prayer time.

[00:35:13.780 --> 00:35:16.780]   (soft music)
[00:35:16.780 --> 00:35:34.780]   - Okay, just to kind of give you a heads up,
[00:35:34.780 --> 00:35:36.780]   what we're planning to do today is,
[00:35:36.780 --> 00:35:42.780]   after I give a brief encouragement,
[00:35:42.780 --> 00:35:44.780]   we're gonna ask those of you up in the front,
[00:35:44.780 --> 00:35:46.780]   we're gonna move out the chairs,
[00:35:46.780 --> 00:35:47.780]   the white chairs completely,
[00:35:47.780 --> 00:35:50.780]   and then we're gonna have you guys kind of sit on there.
[00:35:50.780 --> 00:35:52.780]   That's why we have carpet on there.
[00:35:52.780 --> 00:35:55.780]   And I don't know how many of you guys kind of brought mats.
[00:35:55.780 --> 00:35:57.780]   Again, we're just leaving it up to you.
[00:35:57.780 --> 00:36:00.780]   And then at some point in our prayer time,
[00:36:00.780 --> 00:36:03.780]   we're gonna ask those of you who want to pray
[00:36:03.780 --> 00:36:05.780]   and ask for prayer to come up
[00:36:05.780 --> 00:36:07.780]   and sit up in the front area somewhere.
[00:36:07.780 --> 00:36:09.780]   And one of the pastors and the elders will come
[00:36:09.780 --> 00:36:12.780]   and we'll pray with you during that time.
[00:36:12.780 --> 00:36:15.780]   Okay, so I'll give you the more specific instructions
[00:36:15.780 --> 00:36:19.780]   as we go, but let me begin with a word of prayer
[00:36:19.780 --> 00:36:21.780]   before we give the encouragement, let's pray.
[00:36:21.780 --> 00:36:33.780]   Heavenly Father, we come before you as unworthy vessels
[00:36:33.780 --> 00:36:36.780]   in needing of your grace, again,
[00:36:38.780 --> 00:36:44.780]   needing of your presence in our lives.
[00:36:44.780 --> 00:36:46.780]   And even in our prayers, Lord God,
[00:36:46.780 --> 00:36:48.780]   we are weak without your help.
[00:36:48.780 --> 00:36:52.780]   We pray, Father, that you would give us alertness,
[00:36:52.780 --> 00:36:57.780]   soberness, a sense of urgency that we may pray
[00:36:57.780 --> 00:36:59.780]   and to seek you out with all our heart.
[00:36:59.780 --> 00:37:03.780]   Open our eyes, Father, and soften our hearts.
[00:37:03.780 --> 00:37:05.780]   And as we have gathered together to worship,
[00:37:05.780 --> 00:37:08.780]   to pray that you would help us, Lord God,
[00:37:08.780 --> 00:37:11.780]   to build this church as a house of prayer.
[00:37:11.780 --> 00:37:13.780]   So we pray for your guidance and your Holy Spirit's
[00:37:13.780 --> 00:37:16.780]   empowerment, in Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:37:16.780 --> 00:37:22.780]   I don't have a specific text that we're gonna be going to,
[00:37:22.780 --> 00:37:24.780]   I'm gonna be jumping from different things,
[00:37:24.780 --> 00:37:27.780]   but whenever we talk about prayer,
[00:37:27.780 --> 00:37:31.780]   I would say one of the biggest things that affects
[00:37:31.780 --> 00:37:35.780]   our ability to pray is our soberness.
[00:37:35.780 --> 00:37:40.780]   If you've come this evening with some sort of urgency,
[00:37:40.780 --> 00:37:43.780]   and you haven't prayed before,
[00:37:43.780 --> 00:37:45.780]   you haven't been in the habit of praying,
[00:37:45.780 --> 00:37:49.780]   but if you came tonight with some sense of urgency,
[00:37:49.780 --> 00:37:51.780]   like something's happening in your life,
[00:37:51.780 --> 00:37:54.780]   something that you desperately need God to answer,
[00:37:54.780 --> 00:37:58.780]   I can almost guarantee you're gonna have effective prayer,
[00:37:58.780 --> 00:38:00.780]   because you know what to pray for.
[00:38:01.780 --> 00:38:04.780]   And oftentimes, prayer is a groaning of your heart
[00:38:04.780 --> 00:38:07.780]   for something that is absolutely needed.
[00:38:07.780 --> 00:38:11.780]   But if that's not the case, and you come into this room
[00:38:11.780 --> 00:38:13.780]   distracted, maybe you just watched a movie
[00:38:13.780 --> 00:38:16.780]   right before you came, or maybe you were doing something
[00:38:16.780 --> 00:38:18.780]   that kind of distracted, and your mind is full
[00:38:18.780 --> 00:38:22.780]   of whatever else that has preoccupied your mind,
[00:38:22.780 --> 00:38:26.780]   even if you've been in prayer before,
[00:38:26.780 --> 00:38:28.780]   and you've been to school of prayer,
[00:38:28.780 --> 00:38:30.780]   you're gonna have a difficult time praying,
[00:38:30.780 --> 00:38:33.780]   because your mind and your heart is gonna lead you
[00:38:33.780 --> 00:38:36.780]   to other places other than to pray.
[00:38:36.780 --> 00:38:40.780]   So our soberness, our sense of urgency,
[00:38:40.780 --> 00:38:44.780]   is directly linked to the effectiveness of how we pray.
[00:38:44.780 --> 00:38:47.780]   Prayer is not something that you can turn on and off,
[00:38:47.780 --> 00:38:51.780]   because prayer is an extension of where you are
[00:38:51.780 --> 00:38:53.780]   before you entered prayer.
[00:38:53.780 --> 00:38:56.780]   Everybody knows how to pray when it is urgent.
[00:38:57.780 --> 00:39:00.780]   When there's something desperate in your heart,
[00:39:00.780 --> 00:39:02.780]   when there's something that you really want
[00:39:02.780 --> 00:39:05.780]   to cry out to God, everybody knows how to pray.
[00:39:05.780 --> 00:39:07.780]   You don't need to have the words,
[00:39:07.780 --> 00:39:09.780]   you don't need to be theologically minded,
[00:39:09.780 --> 00:39:11.780]   you don't need to have many verses,
[00:39:11.780 --> 00:39:14.780]   you don't even have to have practiced it for years.
[00:39:14.780 --> 00:39:18.780]   Because prayer ultimately is an outpouring
[00:39:18.780 --> 00:39:20.780]   of something that you desperately need
[00:39:20.780 --> 00:39:22.780]   answered before God.
[00:39:22.780 --> 00:39:26.780]   But the greatest hindrance to prayer is callousness.
[00:39:26.780 --> 00:39:29.780]   So if you come into this room with a callous heart,
[00:39:29.780 --> 00:39:33.780]   distracted heart, where you came because it's Friday,
[00:39:33.780 --> 00:39:37.780]   this is what Christians do, you're supposed to do this,
[00:39:37.780 --> 00:39:40.780]   then obviously you will have some time struggling.
[00:39:40.780 --> 00:39:44.780]   There are some jobs that we have that requires you
[00:39:44.780 --> 00:39:47.780]   to be to some degree callous.
[00:39:47.780 --> 00:39:50.780]   If you're a soldier in time of war,
[00:39:50.780 --> 00:39:53.780]   and you get overly sensitive,
[00:39:53.780 --> 00:39:57.780]   and you get overly sensitive about everything that happens,
[00:39:57.780 --> 00:39:59.780]   then you can't fight.
[00:39:59.780 --> 00:40:02.780]   I've talked to doctors who are oncologists,
[00:40:02.780 --> 00:40:05.780]   and they're in a habit of giving bad news to people,
[00:40:05.780 --> 00:40:08.780]   saying that your mother or father, your son, daughter,
[00:40:08.780 --> 00:40:11.780]   may only have a few days or a few months to live.
[00:40:11.780 --> 00:40:13.780]   And I remember asking them,
[00:40:13.780 --> 00:40:16.780]   "How do you handle that, going home each night,
[00:40:16.780 --> 00:40:20.780]   "having to have given these horrific news to families?"
[00:40:20.780 --> 00:40:23.780]   He said, "You know, we have to learn to turn it off."
[00:40:23.780 --> 00:40:25.780]   In fact, sometimes they become so callous
[00:40:25.780 --> 00:40:27.780]   that they would tell somebody that they're going to die
[00:40:27.780 --> 00:40:29.780]   in the next few weeks, and then they'll go out
[00:40:29.780 --> 00:40:31.780]   and just joke around with their doctor friends.
[00:40:31.780 --> 00:40:33.780]   And he says, "I know that sounds horrible."
[00:40:33.780 --> 00:40:35.780]   But he said, "If they don't learn how to do that,
[00:40:35.780 --> 00:40:37.780]   "they can't continue to work."
[00:40:37.780 --> 00:40:39.780]   And I know police officers,
[00:40:39.780 --> 00:40:41.780]   that if you don't learn to turn that off,
[00:40:41.780 --> 00:40:43.780]   and you bring home everything that's going on,
[00:40:43.780 --> 00:40:46.780]   it's very difficult to do that for a long period of time.
[00:40:46.780 --> 00:40:52.780]   Some jobs require to be able to turn that off.
[00:40:52.780 --> 00:40:56.780]   But this is exactly the opposite of our Christian faith.
[00:40:56.780 --> 00:40:59.780]   If you turn off your heart,
[00:40:59.780 --> 00:41:01.780]   it affects everything that you do.
[00:41:01.780 --> 00:41:03.780]   If you become callous,
[00:41:03.780 --> 00:41:07.780]   it affects everything that you do.
[00:41:07.780 --> 00:41:09.780]   First, it affects your prayer.
[00:41:09.780 --> 00:41:11.780]   You can't pray,
[00:41:11.780 --> 00:41:13.780]   because your heart is not leading you
[00:41:13.780 --> 00:41:15.780]   to the words that you're saying.
[00:41:15.780 --> 00:41:17.780]   It doesn't actually mean.
[00:41:17.780 --> 00:41:19.780]   What your heart desires and what you are saying
[00:41:19.780 --> 00:41:21.780]   doesn't necessarily matter.
[00:41:21.780 --> 00:41:23.780]   So, the first place where you see,
[00:41:23.780 --> 00:41:25.780]   if you have a callous heart, where you can't,
[00:41:25.780 --> 00:41:28.780]   and you have a very difficult time praying,
[00:41:28.780 --> 00:41:30.780]   is when we have a callous heart.
[00:41:30.780 --> 00:41:33.780]   You cannot worship, because worship is a response
[00:41:33.780 --> 00:41:35.780]   of how you are being affected.
[00:41:35.780 --> 00:41:37.780]   So, if you're not being affected,
[00:41:37.780 --> 00:41:39.780]   and your mind and your heart and your life
[00:41:39.780 --> 00:41:42.780]   is engaged and entangled in civilian affairs,
[00:41:42.780 --> 00:41:45.780]   and all of a sudden you want to go into battle,
[00:41:45.780 --> 00:41:49.780]   you'll find that it is almost impossible.
[00:41:49.780 --> 00:41:53.780]   Our whole Christian life is driven
[00:41:53.780 --> 00:41:56.780]   by what God is doing in our hearts.
[00:41:56.780 --> 00:42:00.780]   So, if we allow our hearts to become callous,
[00:42:00.780 --> 00:42:03.780]   and there's obviously various different terms
[00:42:03.780 --> 00:42:05.780]   that they use for that.
[00:42:05.780 --> 00:42:07.780]   Lukewarmness, right?
[00:42:07.780 --> 00:42:10.780]   Where we become inoculated by the truth
[00:42:10.780 --> 00:42:12.780]   that we hear so often,
[00:42:12.780 --> 00:42:15.780]   that it's just information.
[00:42:15.780 --> 00:42:17.780]   It no longer moves you.
[00:42:17.780 --> 00:42:20.780]   It doesn't stir up a sense of worship or urgency.
[00:42:20.780 --> 00:42:24.780]   Psychologists call this a hedonic adaptation.
[00:42:24.780 --> 00:42:27.780]   Hedonic adaptation basically is a mental habit
[00:42:27.780 --> 00:42:29.780]   of overstimulation of the same thing,
[00:42:29.780 --> 00:42:32.780]   which eventually becomes mundane.
[00:42:32.780 --> 00:42:34.780]   Let me say that again.
[00:42:34.780 --> 00:42:36.780]   Mental habit of overstimulation of the same thing,
[00:42:36.780 --> 00:42:40.780]   which eventually becomes mundane.
[00:42:40.780 --> 00:42:42.780]   Where, as Christians,
[00:42:42.780 --> 00:42:45.780]   because we come to praise this magnificent God
[00:42:45.780 --> 00:42:47.780]   and the glory of Christ and the gospel
[00:42:47.780 --> 00:42:48.780]   and heaven and hell,
[00:42:48.780 --> 00:42:51.780]   but after a year, two years, four years, five years,
[00:42:51.780 --> 00:42:52.780]   it's just you've heard...
[00:42:52.780 --> 00:42:53.780]   How many times have you heard this?
[00:42:53.780 --> 00:42:55.780]   How many times do you memorize this?
[00:42:55.780 --> 00:42:58.780]   And you've allowed your heart to become callous,
[00:42:58.780 --> 00:43:00.780]   and now it's just, well,
[00:43:00.780 --> 00:43:04.780]   let's see who can give the better variation
[00:43:04.780 --> 00:43:07.780]   of the same thing that I already know.
[00:43:07.780 --> 00:43:09.780]   Maybe whose illustration is better?
[00:43:09.780 --> 00:43:11.780]   Who put the sermon together better?
[00:43:11.780 --> 00:43:16.780]   But the content of the message no longer stirs us.
[00:43:16.780 --> 00:43:18.780]   And wanting to find something new,
[00:43:18.780 --> 00:43:20.780]   that only works for a few years,
[00:43:20.780 --> 00:43:24.780]   but after a while, there's nothing new under the sun.
[00:43:24.780 --> 00:43:30.780]   Our Christian faith is often driven into lukewarmness.
[00:43:30.780 --> 00:43:33.780]   And according to the book of Revelation,
[00:43:33.780 --> 00:43:36.780]   lukewarmness is not something that just happens.
[00:43:36.780 --> 00:43:38.780]   The Bible says in Revelation chapter 2,
[00:43:38.780 --> 00:43:41.780]   it says you have forsaken your first love.
[00:43:41.780 --> 00:43:43.780]   It's something that we choose to do.
[00:43:43.780 --> 00:43:45.780]   Now, you don't choose to be lukewarm.
[00:43:45.780 --> 00:43:48.780]   You don't say, "I want my heart to be callous,"
[00:43:48.780 --> 00:43:50.780]   but we deliberately choose things
[00:43:50.780 --> 00:43:52.780]   that causes us to become callous.
[00:43:52.780 --> 00:43:56.780]   We don't run from things that causes us to be lukewarm.
[00:43:56.780 --> 00:43:58.780]   We don't actively pursue with all our heart
[00:43:58.780 --> 00:44:02.780]   the things that cause us heart to melt
[00:44:02.780 --> 00:44:03.780]   and to be softened.
[00:44:03.780 --> 00:44:05.780]   So as a result of that,
[00:44:05.780 --> 00:44:07.780]   one, two, three steps down the line,
[00:44:07.780 --> 00:44:09.780]   we have chosen.
[00:44:09.780 --> 00:44:13.780]   We have chosen the steps that will lead us to a callous heart.
[00:44:13.780 --> 00:44:16.780]   And once we become callous,
[00:44:16.780 --> 00:44:18.780]   nothing gets through.
[00:44:18.780 --> 00:44:19.780]   We go through the habit.
[00:44:19.780 --> 00:44:20.780]   We do what's right,
[00:44:20.780 --> 00:44:22.780]   but we're no longer actively engaged.
[00:44:22.780 --> 00:44:25.780]   And where that is demonstrated more than anything else
[00:44:25.780 --> 00:44:27.780]   is prayer.
[00:44:27.780 --> 00:44:28.780]   You can open up your lips,
[00:44:28.780 --> 00:44:30.780]   and you can be touched by the music,
[00:44:30.780 --> 00:44:33.780]   and you can, depending on the style,
[00:44:33.780 --> 00:44:35.780]   depending on the musician,
[00:44:35.780 --> 00:44:37.780]   you may be manipulated for a period,
[00:44:37.780 --> 00:44:39.780]   but prayer is something you cannot do
[00:44:39.780 --> 00:44:44.780]   if your heart is callous.
[00:44:44.780 --> 00:44:48.780]   Some of the words that are synonyms to the word callous,
[00:44:48.780 --> 00:44:52.780]   cauterized, thick-skinned, hardened, insensitive,
[00:44:52.780 --> 00:44:55.780]   deadened to feelings, indifference to suffering,
[00:44:55.780 --> 00:44:59.780]   cold-blooded, emotionally unavailable.
[00:44:59.780 --> 00:45:03.780]   We're no longer moved by the things that move us.
[00:45:03.780 --> 00:45:06.780]   Scripture tells us sin, first and foremost,
[00:45:06.780 --> 00:45:09.780]   is at the heart of callousness.
[00:45:09.780 --> 00:45:11.780]   2 Corinthians 3.14, Paul says,
[00:45:11.780 --> 00:45:15.780]   "But their minds were hardened for until this very day
[00:45:15.780 --> 00:45:17.780]   at the reading of the old covenant,
[00:45:17.780 --> 00:45:18.780]   the same veil remains unlifted
[00:45:18.780 --> 00:45:21.780]   because it is removed in Christ."
[00:45:21.780 --> 00:45:25.780]   He says their minds were hardened.
[00:45:25.780 --> 00:45:26.780]   Their minds are hardened.
[00:45:26.780 --> 00:45:28.780]   So when they hear the truth,
[00:45:28.780 --> 00:45:30.780]   when the glory of God is revealed,
[00:45:30.780 --> 00:45:32.780]   nothing happens.
[00:45:32.780 --> 00:45:34.780]   It's like hardened clay.
[00:45:34.780 --> 00:45:35.780]   It's no longer moldable.
[00:45:35.780 --> 00:45:37.780]   And he said that's how a non-Christian is described.
[00:45:37.780 --> 00:45:40.780]   But even a Christian, Hebrews 3.13,
[00:45:40.780 --> 00:45:44.780]   is warned, "But encourage one another day after day,
[00:45:44.780 --> 00:45:45.780]   as long as it is still called today,
[00:45:45.780 --> 00:45:48.780]   so that none of you will be hardened
[00:45:48.780 --> 00:45:52.780]   by the deceitfulness of sin."
[00:45:52.780 --> 00:45:56.780]   When we have sin,
[00:45:56.780 --> 00:45:58.780]   that is whether it's external
[00:45:58.780 --> 00:46:01.780]   or whether it's internal,
[00:46:01.780 --> 00:46:06.780]   whether it is just bitterness, anger, slander, judgment,
[00:46:06.780 --> 00:46:09.780]   prejudice, whatever that may be,
[00:46:09.780 --> 00:46:13.780]   when we allow sin and you allow callousness,
[00:46:13.780 --> 00:46:16.780]   and once callousness steps in,
[00:46:16.780 --> 00:46:19.780]   there's nothing.
[00:46:19.780 --> 00:46:20.780]   There's no amount of preaching,
[00:46:20.780 --> 00:46:22.780]   no amount of accountability,
[00:46:22.780 --> 00:46:24.780]   no amount of having a good community around you.
[00:46:24.780 --> 00:46:30.780]   Eventually we become inoculated by the truth.
[00:46:30.780 --> 00:46:34.780]   Callousness affects the way we see Scripture.
[00:46:34.780 --> 00:46:36.780]   Not only does it prevent us from praying,
[00:46:36.780 --> 00:46:38.780]   prevent us from worshiping,
[00:46:38.780 --> 00:46:41.780]   but even the way you understand Scripture,
[00:46:41.780 --> 00:46:44.780]   it's not, our ability to understand the heart of God
[00:46:44.780 --> 00:46:47.780]   is not purely a mental exercise.
[00:46:47.780 --> 00:46:49.780]   It is a spiritual exercise.
[00:46:49.780 --> 00:46:51.780]   This is what Jesus says to the disciples,
[00:46:51.780 --> 00:46:53.780]   and Jesus, aware of this, said to them,
[00:46:53.780 --> 00:46:54.780]   to the disciples,
[00:46:54.780 --> 00:46:57.780]   "Why do you discuss the fact that you have no bread?
[00:46:57.780 --> 00:46:59.780]   Do you not yet see or understand?
[00:46:59.780 --> 00:47:03.780]   Do you have a hardened heart?"
[00:47:03.780 --> 00:47:05.780]   After everything that God made clear,
[00:47:05.780 --> 00:47:07.780]   Jesus made clear to them,
[00:47:07.780 --> 00:47:09.780]   they still couldn't understand.
[00:47:09.780 --> 00:47:11.780]   And the way Jesus described that, he says,
[00:47:11.780 --> 00:47:13.780]   "It's because of your hardened heart,
[00:47:13.780 --> 00:47:17.780]   that even though I made it very plain to you,
[00:47:17.780 --> 00:47:18.780]   it's not getting through.
[00:47:18.780 --> 00:47:20.780]   Having eyes do you not see,
[00:47:20.780 --> 00:47:21.780]   and having ears do you not hear,
[00:47:21.780 --> 00:47:23.780]   and do you not remember,
[00:47:23.780 --> 00:47:25.780]   when I broke the five loaves for the five thousand,
[00:47:25.780 --> 00:47:28.780]   how many baskets full of broken pieces you picked up?"
[00:47:28.780 --> 00:47:29.780]   They said to him, "Twelve."
[00:47:29.780 --> 00:47:31.780]   "When I broke the seven for the four thousand,
[00:47:31.780 --> 00:47:34.780]   how many large baskets full of broken pieces did you pick up?"
[00:47:34.780 --> 00:47:35.780]   And they said to him, "Seven."
[00:47:35.780 --> 00:47:37.780]   And he was saying to them,
[00:47:37.780 --> 00:47:41.780]   "Do you not yet understand?"
[00:47:41.780 --> 00:47:45.780]   After having made it so crystal clear,
[00:47:45.780 --> 00:47:49.780]   he said, "Even the obvious things,"
[00:47:49.780 --> 00:47:51.780]   he said, "Why do you not understand?"
[00:47:51.780 --> 00:47:54.780]   So sometimes the non-Christians,
[00:47:54.780 --> 00:47:56.780]   who do not believe God,
[00:47:56.780 --> 00:47:58.780]   see the way the Christians respond
[00:47:58.780 --> 00:47:59.780]   to the things that we sing,
[00:47:59.780 --> 00:48:01.780]   and things that we profess, and say,
[00:48:01.780 --> 00:48:04.780]   "I don't know if you really believe that.
[00:48:04.780 --> 00:48:06.780]   I can't believe people who believe that
[00:48:06.780 --> 00:48:11.780]   would be that callous toward the things that they say."
[00:48:11.780 --> 00:48:14.780]   We are told repeatedly, over and over again,
[00:48:14.780 --> 00:48:15.780]   the danger for Christians,
[00:48:15.780 --> 00:48:17.780]   if you've been a Christian for a while,
[00:48:17.780 --> 00:48:18.780]   or even for a short period of time,
[00:48:18.780 --> 00:48:20.780]   is to not to drift.
[00:48:20.780 --> 00:48:23.780]   And that's what the whole book of Hebrews was about.
[00:48:23.780 --> 00:48:24.780]   Do not drift. Pay attention.
[00:48:24.780 --> 00:48:27.780]   Do not drift. Pay attention.
[00:48:27.780 --> 00:48:30.780]   How will we escape if we neglect such a great salvation?
[00:48:30.780 --> 00:48:32.780]   Simply out of neglect.
[00:48:32.780 --> 00:48:33.780]   Simply because you're raising your children,
[00:48:33.780 --> 00:48:36.780]   you're paying your bills, going to school.
[00:48:36.780 --> 00:48:39.780]   That in the context of living,
[00:48:39.780 --> 00:48:40.780]   you've just drifted,
[00:48:40.780 --> 00:48:44.780]   and you've allowed your heart to become callous.
[00:48:44.780 --> 00:48:46.780]   I know how easy it is to become callous,
[00:48:46.780 --> 00:48:48.780]   because even as I prepare sermons,
[00:48:48.780 --> 00:48:52.780]   I can become callous.
[00:48:52.780 --> 00:48:54.780]   I mean, if you don't preach for a living,
[00:48:54.780 --> 00:48:57.780]   you might not understand what I'm saying.
[00:48:57.780 --> 00:48:59.780]   But even as I'm preparing scripture,
[00:48:59.780 --> 00:49:01.780]   even as I am preparing to encourage you,
[00:49:01.780 --> 00:49:03.780]   to challenge you,
[00:49:03.780 --> 00:49:06.780]   this can become habitual.
[00:49:06.780 --> 00:49:08.780]   And my heart becomes callous,
[00:49:08.780 --> 00:49:10.780]   and I focus on what I need to put together,
[00:49:10.780 --> 00:49:12.780]   how this is going to sound.
[00:49:12.780 --> 00:49:14.780]   Is this right? Is this wrong?
[00:49:14.780 --> 00:49:17.780]   And all this can be done with a callous heart,
[00:49:17.780 --> 00:49:19.780]   and none of it affecting me,
[00:49:19.780 --> 00:49:22.780]   hoping all of it would affect you.
[00:49:22.780 --> 00:49:24.780]   Easily.
[00:49:24.780 --> 00:49:28.780]   And if I don't carefully watch my own heart,
[00:49:28.780 --> 00:49:33.780]   even this can be done in callousness.
[00:49:33.780 --> 00:49:36.780]   We are told to be careful not to neglect,
[00:49:36.780 --> 00:49:38.780]   not to be hardened.
[00:49:38.780 --> 00:49:42.780]   Ephesus says, "Do not forsake your first love."
[00:49:42.780 --> 00:49:45.780]   1 Corinthians, "Do not be lukewarm."
[00:49:45.780 --> 00:49:46.780]   Over and over again.
[00:49:46.780 --> 00:49:49.780]   Why is this such a big problem?
[00:49:49.780 --> 00:49:55.780]   Because the next step of callousness is unbelief.
[00:49:55.780 --> 00:49:58.780]   The next step of,
[00:49:58.780 --> 00:50:02.780]   if you continue to accept callousness and lukewarmness
[00:50:02.780 --> 00:50:04.780]   and neglect of your salvation,
[00:50:04.780 --> 00:50:07.780]   and that becomes a normal pattern of your life,
[00:50:07.780 --> 00:50:11.780]   you're one crisis away from walking away from your faith.
[00:50:11.780 --> 00:50:12.780]   You're one crisis away.
[00:50:12.780 --> 00:50:14.780]   Because you're not grounded.
[00:50:14.780 --> 00:50:16.780]   So what's keeping you is not the love of Christ.
[00:50:16.780 --> 00:50:20.780]   What's keeping you is not truth.
[00:50:20.780 --> 00:50:23.780]   What's keeping you is habit.
[00:50:23.780 --> 00:50:26.780]   That's why when the pandemic hit,
[00:50:26.780 --> 00:50:29.780]   so many people who are hanging on out of habit,
[00:50:29.780 --> 00:50:31.780]   when the habit of going to church was broken,
[00:50:31.780 --> 00:50:34.780]   they no longer felt the need to go to church.
[00:50:34.780 --> 00:50:36.780]   Because what was keeping them going
[00:50:36.780 --> 00:50:38.780]   was not passion and love for Christ,
[00:50:38.780 --> 00:50:40.780]   was not truth, was not conviction,
[00:50:40.780 --> 00:50:43.780]   was not love, but simply habit.
[00:50:43.780 --> 00:50:45.780]   And all that needed to happen for that to be broken
[00:50:45.780 --> 00:50:49.780]   was for that habit to be broken.
[00:50:49.780 --> 00:50:52.780]   We have to watch our callousness.
[00:50:52.780 --> 00:50:55.780]   If we're lukewarm, you are in danger.
[00:50:55.780 --> 00:50:57.780]   We are all in danger
[00:50:57.780 --> 00:51:02.780]   that we do not accept that as a normal pattern of life.
[00:51:02.780 --> 00:51:04.780]   And callousness is not obvious.
[00:51:04.780 --> 00:51:06.780]   No one's going to point you out and say,
[00:51:06.780 --> 00:51:07.780]   "Hey, you didn't sing loud enough,"
[00:51:07.780 --> 00:51:10.780]   or, "You didn't pray with passion."
[00:51:10.780 --> 00:51:11.780]   No one's going to point that out.
[00:51:11.780 --> 00:51:13.780]   Only you know that.
[00:51:13.780 --> 00:51:15.780]   Some people's passions are quiet.
[00:51:15.780 --> 00:51:16.780]   Some people's passions are loud.
[00:51:16.780 --> 00:51:21.780]   You can't just determine that passion from external things.
[00:51:21.780 --> 00:51:23.780]   But you know that.
[00:51:23.780 --> 00:51:28.780]   I know that if my heart is lukewarm.
[00:51:28.780 --> 00:51:31.780]   Over and over again, the Bible tells us
[00:51:31.780 --> 00:51:35.780]   that God is anything but callous.
[00:51:35.780 --> 00:51:38.780]   If God was callous toward us, lukewarm toward us,
[00:51:38.780 --> 00:51:39.780]   you and I would not be here.
[00:51:39.780 --> 00:51:41.780]   We would have been a long time ago.
[00:51:41.780 --> 00:51:44.780]   He would have just handed us over, let you just do,
[00:51:44.780 --> 00:51:47.780]   because out of callousness.
[00:51:47.780 --> 00:51:48.780]   He would have just kind of allowed us.
[00:51:48.780 --> 00:51:50.780]   In fact, that's what the Bible says,
[00:51:50.780 --> 00:51:53.780]   that final stage of judgment is that He just releases us.
[00:51:53.780 --> 00:51:54.780]   He just kind of lets it go, lets you drift,
[00:51:54.780 --> 00:51:56.780]   lets you go on your path.
[00:51:56.780 --> 00:51:59.780]   Instead of fighting for us.
[00:51:59.780 --> 00:52:03.780]   47 times in the Bible, the Scripture tells us
[00:52:03.780 --> 00:52:05.780]   that because He is compassionate,
[00:52:05.780 --> 00:52:08.780]   we are not consumed.
[00:52:08.780 --> 00:52:10.780]   Number 3, 22, 23.
[00:52:10.780 --> 00:52:12.780]   The Lord's love and kindness indeed never cease,
[00:52:12.780 --> 00:52:14.780]   for His compassion never fail.
[00:52:14.780 --> 00:52:17.780]   They are new every morning, great is your faithfulness.
[00:52:17.780 --> 00:52:19.780]   In the NIV, it says because of His great love,
[00:52:19.780 --> 00:52:22.780]   we are not consumed.
[00:52:22.780 --> 00:52:25.780]   We're not simply here because we chose the right path
[00:52:25.780 --> 00:52:26.780]   and we're walking toward the right things
[00:52:26.780 --> 00:52:27.780]   and we're doing the right things.
[00:52:27.780 --> 00:52:29.780]   He said it's because of His loving kindness,
[00:52:29.780 --> 00:52:32.780]   because of His compassion toward us,
[00:52:32.780 --> 00:52:35.780]   that He's not allowing us to just simply drift.
[00:52:35.780 --> 00:52:38.780]   He is fighting for us.
[00:52:38.780 --> 00:52:40.780]   In Psalm 103, 10-13,
[00:52:40.780 --> 00:52:44.780]   He has not dealt with us according to our sins,
[00:52:44.780 --> 00:52:47.780]   nor rewarded us according to our iniquities.
[00:52:47.780 --> 00:52:49.780]   For as high as the heavens are above the earth,
[00:52:49.780 --> 00:52:52.780]   so great is His loving kindness toward those who fear Him.
[00:52:52.780 --> 00:52:53.780]   As far as the east is from the west,
[00:52:53.780 --> 00:52:56.780]   so far has He removed our transgressions from us.
[00:52:56.780 --> 00:52:59.780]   Just as a father has compassion on his children,
[00:52:59.780 --> 00:53:04.780]   so the Lord has compassion on those who fear Him.
[00:53:04.780 --> 00:53:05.780]   It's because of His compassion.
[00:53:05.780 --> 00:53:08.780]   You know, for God to judge us
[00:53:08.780 --> 00:53:10.780]   and deal with us according to our sins,
[00:53:10.780 --> 00:53:11.780]   you know what He has to do?
[00:53:11.780 --> 00:53:13.780]   Do nothing.
[00:53:13.780 --> 00:53:15.780]   Do nothing.
[00:53:15.780 --> 00:53:17.780]   It's like a drug addict
[00:53:17.780 --> 00:53:20.780]   that has nobody around him cares
[00:53:20.780 --> 00:53:25.780]   and just let him do what he wants to do.
[00:53:25.780 --> 00:53:28.780]   And the judgment of the choices that he's making
[00:53:28.780 --> 00:53:31.780]   is going to be obvious.
[00:53:31.780 --> 00:53:35.780]   All God has to do is to be indifferent toward us,
[00:53:35.780 --> 00:53:37.780]   and we would be consumed.
[00:53:37.780 --> 00:53:38.780]   The reason why you and I are here
[00:53:38.780 --> 00:53:40.780]   is because He's not indifferent toward us.
[00:53:40.780 --> 00:53:44.780]   The Bible says repeatedly that He has compassion.
[00:53:44.780 --> 00:53:46.780]   In fact, everything Jesus did, the Bible says,
[00:53:46.780 --> 00:53:49.780]   He did it because of compassion.
[00:53:49.780 --> 00:53:50.780]   Matthew 14, 14,
[00:53:50.780 --> 00:53:52.780]   "When He went ashore, He saw a large crowd
[00:53:52.780 --> 00:53:55.780]   and felt compassion for them, and He healed their sick."
[00:53:55.780 --> 00:53:57.780]   And over and over again, the Bible says,
[00:53:57.780 --> 00:53:58.780]   the reason why He did that--
[00:53:58.780 --> 00:54:03.780]   I mean, Jesus was so tired.
[00:54:03.780 --> 00:54:05.780]   I mean, if anybody deserved a rest,
[00:54:05.780 --> 00:54:07.780]   to just break away and stop ministry,
[00:54:07.780 --> 00:54:11.780]   I mean, He decided that He was going to go to the cross.
[00:54:11.780 --> 00:54:13.780]   If He did nothing, if He didn't heal anybody,
[00:54:13.780 --> 00:54:15.780]   just enough so that they can say,
[00:54:15.780 --> 00:54:17.780]   "Oh, He has power," and then went to the cross,
[00:54:17.780 --> 00:54:18.780]   that would have been enough.
[00:54:18.780 --> 00:54:19.780]   But it says, everything He did,
[00:54:19.780 --> 00:54:21.780]   He was moved by compassion.
[00:54:21.780 --> 00:54:25.780]   When He saw their suffering, He was moved.
[00:54:25.780 --> 00:54:30.780]   Because He was moved, He tirelessly did ministry.
[00:54:30.780 --> 00:54:33.780]   Matthew 15, 32, "Jesus called His disciples to Him and said,
[00:54:33.780 --> 00:54:35.780]   'I feel compassion for these people,
[00:54:35.780 --> 00:54:37.780]   because they have remained with Me now three days
[00:54:37.780 --> 00:54:38.780]   and have nothing to eat,
[00:54:38.780 --> 00:54:40.780]   and I do not want to send them away hungry,
[00:54:40.780 --> 00:54:42.780]   for they might faint on the way.'"
[00:54:42.780 --> 00:54:46.780]   Even their hunger, He had compassion on them.
[00:54:46.780 --> 00:54:49.780]   At Lazarus' grave, even though He was about to raise them,
[00:54:49.780 --> 00:54:51.780]   He weeps in front of them
[00:54:51.780 --> 00:54:54.780]   because He sees the suffering of mankind.
[00:54:54.780 --> 00:54:57.780]   Even as they reject Him, as He's going into Jerusalem,
[00:54:57.780 --> 00:54:59.780]   even as He knows that He's going to be crucified
[00:54:59.780 --> 00:55:01.780]   at the end of that week,
[00:55:01.780 --> 00:55:04.780]   He weeps for Israel because of their sin
[00:55:04.780 --> 00:55:06.780]   and the judgment that's coming upon them
[00:55:06.780 --> 00:55:08.780]   because of what's about to happen.
[00:55:08.780 --> 00:55:10.780]   Everything that you and I have
[00:55:10.780 --> 00:55:14.780]   is because He was compassionate toward us.
[00:55:14.780 --> 00:55:20.780]   So when He says, "Pick up your cross and follow Me,"
[00:55:20.780 --> 00:55:22.780]   the path that He wants us to follow,
[00:55:22.780 --> 00:55:25.780]   yes, there is suffering, there's sacrifice,
[00:55:25.780 --> 00:55:27.780]   but the path that He wants us to walk along with Him
[00:55:27.780 --> 00:55:30.780]   is why He picked up the cross.
[00:55:30.780 --> 00:55:32.780]   Not just the fact that He picked up the cross,
[00:55:32.780 --> 00:55:33.780]   but why He picked up the cross.
[00:55:33.780 --> 00:55:38.780]   He picked up the cross because He had compassion for sinners.
[00:55:38.780 --> 00:55:41.780]   So why do we need to pray?
[00:55:41.780 --> 00:55:44.780]   Yes, we pray when we're sick.
[00:55:44.780 --> 00:55:45.780]   We pray when there's need.
[00:55:45.780 --> 00:55:47.780]   We pray when we're lonely.
[00:55:47.780 --> 00:55:50.780]   We pray because we need financial help.
[00:55:50.780 --> 00:55:52.780]   Our family's not the way that we want.
[00:55:52.780 --> 00:55:53.780]   Yes, all these things we want to pray,
[00:55:53.780 --> 00:55:56.780]   but the primary reason why God calls us to pray
[00:55:56.780 --> 00:56:01.780]   is the same reason why Jesus prays.
[00:56:01.780 --> 00:56:06.780]   He prays because He was compassionate toward us.
[00:56:06.780 --> 00:56:08.780]   When He says, "Abide in My word,"
[00:56:08.780 --> 00:56:10.780]   if you abide in My word, ask whatever you wish.
[00:56:10.780 --> 00:56:14.780]   What is it that He wants us to abide in?
[00:56:14.780 --> 00:56:17.780]   Just be pure? Be the poor?
[00:56:17.780 --> 00:56:19.780]   Yes, all that is true.
[00:56:19.780 --> 00:56:25.780]   But what's the primary thing that Jesus wanted His disciples to abide in?
[00:56:25.780 --> 00:56:27.780]   He said, "Son of man, did not come to be served, but to serve,
[00:56:27.780 --> 00:56:29.780]   and to give His life as a ransom for many."
[00:56:29.780 --> 00:56:31.780]   So when He told His disciples to abide in Me,
[00:56:31.780 --> 00:56:35.780]   He's telling them to do what I do when I leave.
[00:56:35.780 --> 00:56:37.780]   Do what I do when I leave.
[00:56:37.780 --> 00:56:40.780]   So what is the primary thing that He wants us to abide in
[00:56:40.780 --> 00:56:42.780]   so that He can answer our prayers?
[00:56:42.780 --> 00:56:46.780]   It's to pursue sinners.
[00:56:46.780 --> 00:56:51.780]   That's the primary way that we are to abide in Christ.
[00:56:51.780 --> 00:56:54.780]   So when you pray for the lost, He says, "I will answer you,
[00:56:54.780 --> 00:56:57.780]   because that's exactly what I want you to do.
[00:56:57.780 --> 00:57:01.780]   I want you to follow Me, to pick up the cross,
[00:57:01.780 --> 00:57:05.780]   so that the lost may come to Christ."
[00:57:05.780 --> 00:57:10.780]   But when our hearts are hardened and calloused,
[00:57:10.780 --> 00:57:13.780]   the lost becomes a burden,
[00:57:13.780 --> 00:57:16.780]   almost an annoyance.
[00:57:16.780 --> 00:57:18.780]   People keep coming to church.
[00:57:18.780 --> 00:57:21.780]   There's more people we've got to take care of.
[00:57:21.780 --> 00:57:24.780]   More people to be concerned about. Isn't that enough?
[00:57:24.780 --> 00:57:26.780]   When our hearts become calloused,
[00:57:26.780 --> 00:57:29.780]   it just becomes added number to the larger crowd,
[00:57:29.780 --> 00:57:32.780]   and we're just adding more and more.
[00:57:32.780 --> 00:57:36.780]   Because we do not understand the heart of Christ.
[00:57:36.780 --> 00:57:38.780]   We do not understand the heart of Christ.
[00:57:38.780 --> 00:57:40.780]   Just like the Pharisees.
[00:57:40.780 --> 00:57:44.780]   They were so concerned about being pure,
[00:57:44.780 --> 00:57:46.780]   but they completely misunderstood,
[00:57:46.780 --> 00:57:48.780]   or did not understand,
[00:57:48.780 --> 00:57:51.780]   or rejected God's purpose for them.
[00:57:51.780 --> 00:57:53.780]   Why aren't you seeking the lost?
[00:57:53.780 --> 00:57:55.780]   Why aren't you where the sinners are?
[00:57:55.780 --> 00:58:00.780]   Why do you not care about people who are lost?
[00:58:00.780 --> 00:58:04.780]   Let me conclude with this.
[00:58:04.780 --> 00:58:09.780]   In Matthew 24, 12, we are warned
[00:58:09.780 --> 00:58:11.780]   "Because lawlessness will be increased,
[00:58:11.780 --> 00:58:14.780]   the love of many will grow cold.
[00:58:14.780 --> 00:58:18.780]   But the one who endures to the end will be saved.
[00:58:18.780 --> 00:58:20.780]   And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed
[00:58:20.780 --> 00:58:22.780]   throughout the whole world as a testimony to all the nations,
[00:58:22.780 --> 00:58:26.780]   and then the end will come."
[00:58:26.780 --> 00:58:31.780]   So the question that I want to wrestle together with you is,
[00:58:31.780 --> 00:58:33.780]   what is it about the increase in lawlessness
[00:58:33.780 --> 00:58:38.780]   that causes most people's love to grow cold?
[00:58:38.780 --> 00:58:42.780]   What is it about the increase of wickedness,
[00:58:42.780 --> 00:58:46.780]   which I think every single one of us would agree?
[00:58:46.780 --> 00:58:48.780]   I mean, I know that every generation says,
[00:58:48.780 --> 00:58:51.780]   "Man, this is getting bad.
[00:58:51.780 --> 00:58:53.780]   The immorality, the debauchery,
[00:58:53.780 --> 00:58:55.780]   the sexual stuff that's being accepted,
[00:58:55.780 --> 00:58:57.780]   sometimes even inside the church.
[00:58:57.780 --> 00:59:00.780]   I mean, it has gotten so bad.
[00:59:00.780 --> 00:59:03.780]   The mutilation of young children,
[00:59:03.780 --> 00:59:06.780]   not even being able to identify if you're a man or a female,
[00:59:06.780 --> 00:59:10.780]   and just abortion at will."
[00:59:10.780 --> 00:59:15.780]   I mean, I don't think I need to describe to you
[00:59:15.780 --> 00:59:17.780]   because we're all part of the same generation.
[00:59:17.780 --> 00:59:20.780]   And I say, the years that I've been a Christian,
[00:59:20.780 --> 00:59:22.780]   and I know that every generation says this,
[00:59:22.780 --> 00:59:27.780]   but this is unimaginable how far we have come.
[00:59:27.780 --> 00:59:31.780]   But what is it about the increase of darkness and wickedness
[00:59:31.780 --> 00:59:36.780]   that causes us to grow cold?
[00:59:36.780 --> 00:59:42.780]   Love grows cold because people will succumb to greater temptation.
[00:59:42.780 --> 00:59:47.780]   Right now, your temptation is on your phone.
[00:59:47.780 --> 00:59:52.780]   I mean, sexual immorality is on your phone,
[00:59:52.780 --> 00:59:54.780]   which is private, it's personal,
[00:59:54.780 --> 00:59:57.780]   and you can access it 24/7.
[00:59:57.780 --> 00:59:59.780]   So because of increase of wickedness,
[00:59:59.780 --> 01:00:01.780]   there's more temptation.
[01:00:01.780 --> 01:00:05.780]   As a result of more temptation, more people will fall.
[01:00:05.780 --> 01:00:08.780]   And as a result of the compromise of that,
[01:00:08.780 --> 01:00:09.780]   your love will grow cold.
[01:00:09.780 --> 01:00:13.780]   There is no way that you can be compromised in sin
[01:00:13.780 --> 01:00:17.780]   and be passionate toward the things of God.
[01:00:17.780 --> 01:00:23.780]   Love grows cold because persecution of the light will increase
[01:00:23.780 --> 01:00:25.780]   because the line is much more clear today
[01:00:25.780 --> 01:00:27.780]   than it was even five years ago.
[01:00:27.780 --> 01:00:30.780]   Are you with Christ or against Christ?
[01:00:30.780 --> 01:00:32.780]   And so because the line has been drawn,
[01:00:32.780 --> 01:00:34.780]   and that line has become clearer and clearer,
[01:00:34.780 --> 01:00:40.780]   and it's becoming more and more difficult to take the middle ground,
[01:00:40.780 --> 01:00:44.780]   anyone who is striving to live a comfortable life
[01:00:44.780 --> 01:00:48.780]   is going to find it very, very difficult
[01:00:48.780 --> 01:00:50.780]   to have a passionate heart for Christ
[01:00:50.780 --> 01:00:52.780]   because you will be compromised
[01:00:52.780 --> 01:00:57.780]   by avoiding persecution at every level.
[01:00:57.780 --> 01:01:00.780]   Love will grow cold because the narrow way
[01:01:00.780 --> 01:01:06.780]   will seem even narrower than before.
[01:01:06.780 --> 01:01:08.780]   He said a few will be found in it,
[01:01:08.780 --> 01:01:10.780]   and you'll find that there's less and less people
[01:01:10.780 --> 01:01:12.780]   that you will be able to relate to.
[01:01:12.780 --> 01:01:18.780]   So the temptation when wickedness increases
[01:01:18.780 --> 01:01:23.780]   is to stay with the crowd, even in the church.
[01:01:23.780 --> 01:01:24.780]   Stay with the crowd.
[01:01:24.780 --> 01:01:27.780]   Don't go too far. Don't fall behind.
[01:01:27.780 --> 01:01:28.780]   But to stay with the crowd.
[01:01:28.780 --> 01:01:32.780]   But sometimes the crowd is lukewarm.
[01:01:32.780 --> 01:01:35.780]   Oftentimes the crowd is lukewarm and callous.
[01:01:35.780 --> 01:01:40.780]   So if you stay with the crowd, you will also be callous and lukewarm.
[01:01:40.780 --> 01:01:42.780]   Because of increase in wickedness,
[01:01:42.780 --> 01:01:46.780]   there's a greater temptation than not to break away.
[01:01:46.780 --> 01:01:49.780]   We're only committed to righteousness
[01:01:49.780 --> 01:01:52.780]   if we all do it together.
[01:01:52.780 --> 01:01:57.780]   If we're not doing it together, we end up not doing it.
[01:01:57.780 --> 01:02:03.780]   Love will grow cold because of the increase of callousness,
[01:02:03.780 --> 01:02:08.780]   because lukewarmness becomes the norm.
[01:02:08.780 --> 01:02:11.780]   It becomes the norm.
[01:02:11.780 --> 01:02:14.780]   Almost everybody around you is that way,
[01:02:14.780 --> 01:02:17.780]   so you think that this is normal.
[01:02:17.780 --> 01:02:21.780]   As a result of increase of wickedness,
[01:02:21.780 --> 01:02:23.780]   the temptation is for us to grow cold.
[01:02:23.780 --> 01:02:27.780]   This is where you and I are.
[01:02:27.780 --> 01:02:33.780]   Even if you are in a crowd of people pursuing what you think is right,
[01:02:33.780 --> 01:02:35.780]   the temptation to really go beyond that
[01:02:35.780 --> 01:02:38.780]   because we want to stay with the group that we're at.
[01:02:38.780 --> 01:02:41.780]   You just happen to be at a church where we have a different level,
[01:02:41.780 --> 01:02:44.780]   and your church would have another level.
[01:02:44.780 --> 01:02:49.780]   So because of increase of wickedness, love will grow cold.
[01:02:49.780 --> 01:02:55.780]   Very, very few people are passionately pursuing God with all their might.
[01:02:55.780 --> 01:02:56.780]   But you know what's interesting here?
[01:02:56.780 --> 01:02:59.780]   It says, "After he warns that many will grow cold,
[01:02:59.780 --> 01:03:04.780]   but the one who endures to the end will be saved."
[01:03:04.780 --> 01:03:08.780]   So who's the one who endures to the end?
[01:03:08.780 --> 01:03:10.780]   Conquers all his sins?
[01:03:10.780 --> 01:03:11.780]   No.
[01:03:11.780 --> 01:03:15.780]   The one whose love does not grow cold.
[01:03:15.780 --> 01:03:17.780]   That's what he means here.
[01:03:17.780 --> 01:03:19.780]   So who's the one who endures?
[01:03:19.780 --> 01:03:23.780]   Not endures, like you were lukewarm all your life and callous all your life,
[01:03:23.780 --> 01:03:25.780]   but you know, I never did drugs.
[01:03:25.780 --> 01:03:27.780]   I never did crazy.
[01:03:27.780 --> 01:03:28.780]   I never murdered anybody.
[01:03:28.780 --> 01:03:31.780]   So I just kind of stayed with the pact, and I made the right decision,
[01:03:31.780 --> 01:03:33.780]   and I served the church a little bit here, a little bit there,
[01:03:33.780 --> 01:03:38.780]   but your heart has been cold and callous and lukewarm the whole time.
[01:03:38.780 --> 01:03:46.780]   He says, "But the one who endures is the one who does not succumb to lukewarmness."
[01:03:46.780 --> 01:03:49.780]   And then he says, "And this gospel of the kingdom will be proclaimed
[01:03:49.780 --> 01:03:52.780]   throughout the whole world as a testimony to all nations,
[01:03:52.780 --> 01:03:53.780]   and then the end will come."
[01:03:53.780 --> 01:03:57.780]   Do you notice here he said world evangelism is going to happen
[01:03:57.780 --> 01:04:00.780]   while most people's love is going to grow cold?
[01:04:00.780 --> 01:04:02.780]   Did you notice that?
[01:04:02.780 --> 01:04:07.780]   He didn't say there's going to be a huge revival of all these people just waking up,
[01:04:07.780 --> 01:04:11.780]   and there's going to be a huge number of people going to commit to seeking the lost.
[01:04:11.780 --> 01:04:12.780]   He says no.
[01:04:12.780 --> 01:04:17.780]   He says the increase of wickedness will cause most people to grow cold,
[01:04:17.780 --> 01:04:22.780]   but the few who endures to the end will take the gospel to the remotest part of the world,
[01:04:22.780 --> 01:04:25.780]   and then the end will come.
[01:04:25.780 --> 01:04:29.780]   So God is raising up the few.
[01:04:29.780 --> 01:04:33.780]   God is calling the few.
[01:04:33.780 --> 01:04:39.780]   And oftentimes when God calls us, he calls us away from the crowd.
[01:04:39.780 --> 01:04:51.780]   So if we want to be prayer warriors, we have to first fight against our callousness.
[01:04:51.780 --> 01:04:55.780]   We have to fight against our lukewarmness, against our neglect.
[01:04:55.780 --> 01:05:01.780]   You cannot turn Jesus on and off, turn it on on Sunday,
[01:05:01.780 --> 01:05:04.780]   and then whenever you're not at church, you live life like anybody else,
[01:05:04.780 --> 01:05:06.780]   and then come to prayer meeting and then turn it back on,
[01:05:06.780 --> 01:05:08.780]   and then when the prayer meeting is over, turn it off,
[01:05:08.780 --> 01:05:12.780]   and then come to church on Sunday and eat the servant and turn it back on.
[01:05:12.780 --> 01:05:19.780]   Just like you can't turn your heart on and off toward people.
[01:05:19.780 --> 01:05:23.780]   I can't just tell you, you two get together and fall in love.
[01:05:23.780 --> 01:05:26.780]   Life will be so much easier.
[01:05:26.780 --> 01:05:31.780]   Bad ministry will be over tomorrow.
[01:05:31.780 --> 01:05:37.780]   Just like I can't tell you to go, you two people fall in love.
[01:05:37.780 --> 01:05:41.780]   Just like you can't turn off your heart and turn it on with people,
[01:05:41.780 --> 01:05:45.780]   you cannot do that with God.
[01:05:45.780 --> 01:05:51.780]   Either you are fighting, fighting to make sure that when you see callousness
[01:05:51.780 --> 01:05:57.780]   and lukewarmness come on, what am I doing that's causing me to be in that state?
[01:05:57.780 --> 01:06:03.780]   Am I headed toward a passionate love for Christ, or am I headed toward lukewarmness?
[01:06:03.780 --> 01:06:06.780]   Where am I? Where am I headed?
[01:06:06.780 --> 01:06:13.780]   So tonight, when we pray, I want you guys to pray along those lines.
[01:06:13.780 --> 01:06:15.780]   First and foremost, the four things.
[01:06:15.780 --> 01:06:21.780]   Ask for forgiveness for any sins, internal and external, that we may have excused in the past.
[01:06:21.780 --> 01:06:23.780]   Are there compromises?
[01:06:23.780 --> 01:06:27.780]   Are you just like, "You know, everybody struggles with this. Everybody does this."
[01:06:27.780 --> 01:06:30.780]   That's a compromise.
[01:06:30.780 --> 01:06:37.780]   Even if the whole world abandons God, that will never be your justification for abandoning God.
[01:06:37.780 --> 01:06:40.780]   Right is right. Wrong is wrong.
[01:06:40.780 --> 01:06:49.780]   If there is bitterness, rebellious heart, sin, impurity, that you have somehow justified in your life,
[01:06:49.780 --> 01:06:53.780]   first and foremost, that is the root of your callousness.
[01:06:53.780 --> 01:06:56.780]   So let's take some time to identify that.
[01:06:56.780 --> 01:06:59.780]   Not just external things, but internal things of our heart, to pray against that.
[01:06:59.780 --> 01:07:02.780]   Pride.
[01:07:02.780 --> 01:07:03.780]   Let's pray against that.
[01:07:03.780 --> 01:07:09.780]   Ask God to soften your heart and open your eyes to see the spiritual reality of heaven and hell we profess to believe.
[01:07:09.780 --> 01:07:12.780]   Think about that.
[01:07:12.780 --> 01:07:19.780]   How does the doctrine of hell not cause you to be stirred?
[01:07:19.780 --> 01:07:22.780]   Hedonic adaptation.
[01:07:22.780 --> 01:07:25.780]   Do you remember the first time you heard that doctrine?
[01:07:25.780 --> 01:07:29.780]   And you believed it?
[01:07:29.780 --> 01:07:32.780]   I mean, think about that.
[01:07:32.780 --> 01:07:38.780]   People are going to go to hell for eternity, where there's gnashing of teeth.
[01:07:38.780 --> 01:07:41.780]   And we live next to these people.
[01:07:41.780 --> 01:07:45.780]   Some of them are family members.
[01:07:45.780 --> 01:07:48.780]   How come it doesn't stir us?
[01:07:48.780 --> 01:07:50.780]   How come we're not urgent?
[01:07:50.780 --> 01:07:57.780]   How come we are more compassionate for a dog that gets run down in the street than a human being who does not know God?
[01:07:57.780 --> 01:08:00.780]   What has caused us to be this heartened?
[01:08:00.780 --> 01:08:03.780]   Why are we so callous?
[01:08:03.780 --> 01:08:09.780]   Ask the Lord to soften our hearts, that we may see the world through His eyes.
[01:08:09.780 --> 01:08:13.780]   That as He wept for Israel, that God would teach us.
[01:08:13.780 --> 01:08:25.780]   If you've never wept for sinners before, you know, it's just so strange in our generation that being a man means that you don't cry.
[01:08:25.780 --> 01:08:27.780]   Jesus cried.
[01:08:27.780 --> 01:08:30.780]   It doesn't make sense that you wouldn't cry.
[01:08:30.780 --> 01:08:37.780]   You wouldn't weep, knowing that all this is going to end one day.
[01:08:37.780 --> 01:08:39.780]   All this is going to end one day.
[01:08:39.780 --> 01:08:45.780]   All the stuff about the market, about the housing, about the politics, all this is going to end one day.
[01:08:45.780 --> 01:08:53.780]   And God is going to divide between those who are His and those who are not, whose names are written in the book of life and those who are not.
[01:08:53.780 --> 01:08:59.780]   Knowing that, why does it no longer bother me?
[01:08:59.780 --> 01:09:01.780]   So let's pray.
[01:09:01.780 --> 01:09:08.780]   Let's pray that God would break our hearts and that He would open our eyes to see through His lens.
[01:09:08.780 --> 01:09:16.780]   That He had so much compassion that He was willing to come off of His throne and empty Himself and become a servant so that you and I would be saved.
[01:09:16.780 --> 01:09:18.780]   That we would have that heart.
[01:09:18.780 --> 01:09:27.780]   I ask that God would give us a spirit of urgency and compassion for the lost, that we may see the world and people through His eyes and have mercy and compassion.
[01:09:27.780 --> 01:09:29.780]   And that we would continue to pray for that.
[01:09:29.780 --> 01:09:33.780]   Pray for what is urgent and dire in your life or the life of others around you.
[01:09:33.780 --> 01:09:35.780]   Start there.
[01:09:35.780 --> 01:09:38.780]   Start your prayers with whatever it is urgent in your life.
[01:09:38.780 --> 01:09:40.780]   Take time to pray for that.
[01:09:40.780 --> 01:09:43.780]   Pray for those who you do know.
[01:09:43.780 --> 01:09:48.780]   If you become callous toward them, maybe you've been trying to share the gospel with them and you haven't seen progress.
[01:09:48.780 --> 01:09:51.780]   And somehow in your heart you've kind of given up.
[01:09:51.780 --> 01:09:54.780]   Take time to pray for that.
[01:09:54.780 --> 01:09:58.780]   Starting there, that God would give you a broken heart for the lost.
[01:09:58.780 --> 01:10:00.780]   The people that you love.
[01:10:00.780 --> 01:10:08.780]   And then as you pray for the things that are urgent in your life, God will give you a heart beyond that.
[01:10:08.780 --> 01:10:12.780]   You're not going to pray for the strangers and then come to your family.
[01:10:12.780 --> 01:10:20.780]   You're going to start to pray for your family and then once you are broken for them, God will lead you to those people that even you do not know.
[01:10:20.780 --> 01:10:24.780]   So this evening, why don't we commit ourselves to pray.
[01:10:24.780 --> 01:10:28.780]   And I'm sure you have your own prayers that you've brought into this room.
[01:10:28.780 --> 01:10:33.780]   And so if now if I can ask you, the white chairs, if you can grab that.
[01:10:33.780 --> 01:10:38.780]   And then just, there's little things here.
[01:10:38.780 --> 01:10:43.780]   And those of you sitting in the back, you don't have to commit to that.
[01:10:43.780 --> 01:10:48.780]   So if as you pray, and again, your posture of prayer is important.
[01:10:48.780 --> 01:10:51.780]   I'm not saying that you have to kneel.
[01:10:51.780 --> 01:10:59.780]   But if you pray nonchalantly, right, it will affect your prayer.
[01:10:59.780 --> 01:11:04.780]   So even if you're going to sit, pray intentionally, right.
[01:11:04.780 --> 01:11:10.780]   Get to a place where you're not going to be distracted.
[01:11:10.780 --> 01:11:18.780]   Be in a posture, whether sitting or kneeling, be in a posture where you're ready to commit to pray.
[01:11:18.780 --> 01:11:26.780]   But don't be casual about it because already by being casual, I can already tell you that you're going to struggle through prayer.
[01:11:26.780 --> 01:11:31.780]   So as this go away, if you brought your own stuff, you can sit on that.
[01:11:31.780 --> 01:11:33.780]   Otherwise, we have carpets that are laid out.
[01:11:33.780 --> 01:11:44.780]   And then about 15 to 20 minutes into our individual prayer, I'm going to ask if you guys, if there's people who want to be prayed for specifically,
[01:11:44.780 --> 01:11:48.780]   I'm going to ask you guys to come to the front near the stairs.
[01:11:48.780 --> 01:11:53.780]   And then the elders and the pastors will be up in the front and take some time to pray for you.
[01:11:53.780 --> 01:11:59.780]   And then somewhere around 9 o'clock to 9.10, we'll wrap it up.
[01:11:59.780 --> 01:12:10.780]   Okay.
[01:12:10.780 --> 01:12:14.780]   Okay, if we can have the music, we're just going to have an open time of prayer.
[01:12:14.780 --> 01:12:20.780]   And I want to encourage you as you're praying, you don't have to pray by yourself.
[01:12:20.780 --> 01:12:23.780]   We're not going to have a time and say, hey, get two or three get together.
[01:12:23.780 --> 01:12:30.780]   If you have friends around you that you want to pray with, whether you're up in the front or you're sitting, just move around and pray together.
[01:12:30.780 --> 01:12:31.780]   Pray for them.
[01:12:31.780 --> 01:12:32.780]   Right.
[01:12:32.780 --> 01:12:35.780]   And and just engage in prayer, whatever you do.
[01:12:35.780 --> 01:12:41.780]   But don't sit there because you're having a hard time concentrating or or your mind is wandering somewhere else and you just give into that.
[01:12:41.780 --> 01:12:43.780]   Persevere in prayer.
[01:12:43.780 --> 01:12:45.780]   Pray with other people if you need to.
[01:12:45.780 --> 01:12:48.780]   And then at the end, if you want to be prayed for, come up to the front.
[01:12:48.780 --> 01:12:49.780]   So let me pray for us.
[01:12:49.780 --> 01:12:55.780]   And then we're just going to open up the time for prayer and give you give you the opportunity to pray.
[01:12:55.780 --> 01:13:01.780]   Heavenly Father, we thank you for bringing the church here to pray together.
[01:13:01.780 --> 01:13:14.780]   Father, we see in the scriptures and example after example, exhortation after exhortation, that you have called us first and foremost to humble ourselves to pray.
[01:13:14.780 --> 01:13:18.780]   Help us to see the desperateness of where we're at.
[01:13:18.780 --> 01:13:24.780]   Lord, sometimes we're not even aware that there is an enemy.
[01:13:24.780 --> 01:13:31.780]   Or prowling around seeking to devour us, that we are engaged in spiritual warfare.
[01:13:31.780 --> 01:13:36.780]   Lord, we confess that we feel safe because we have homes.
[01:13:36.780 --> 01:13:40.780]   We feel safe because our bills are paid.
[01:13:40.780 --> 01:13:42.780]   And we are healthy.
[01:13:42.780 --> 01:13:45.780]   And we know what tomorrow will look like.
[01:13:45.780 --> 01:13:54.780]   Help us, Lord, God, to open our eyes to see how vulnerable we are, how weak we are when we are not abiding in you.
[01:13:54.780 --> 01:14:01.780]   I pray this evening, Lord God, that you would cause us by the power of your spirit to groan within.
[01:14:01.780 --> 01:14:09.780]   That our prayers, Lord God, would be recognition of where we're at and our desperate need for you.
[01:14:09.780 --> 01:14:16.780]   Help us not to simply present our prayers, but to cry out to you in desperate need.
[01:14:16.780 --> 01:14:19.780]   Help us, Lord God.
[01:14:19.780 --> 01:14:26.780]   Help us, Father God, to be a church that prays, to be individuals that pray.
[01:14:26.780 --> 01:14:28.780]   So help us, Lord God.
[01:14:28.780 --> 01:14:29.780]   We lift these things to you.
[01:14:29.780 --> 01:14:30.780]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[01:14:30.780 --> 01:14:31.780]   Amen.

[01:57:00.780 --> 01:57:04.780]   Father, it's because of your compassion for us
[01:57:04.780 --> 01:57:08.780]   that you reconcile to us through the gospel.
[01:57:08.780 --> 01:57:11.780]   Oh God, that we have certainty
[01:57:11.780 --> 01:57:15.780]   because of your resurrection.
[01:57:15.780 --> 01:57:17.780]   We celebrate you, Lord,
[01:57:17.780 --> 01:57:21.780]   for you are faithful to us when we're unfaithful.
[01:57:21.780 --> 01:57:25.780]   You're gracious to us when we're undeserving.
[01:57:25.780 --> 01:57:29.780]   God, I thank you that you continue, Lord, to
[01:57:29.780 --> 01:57:33.780]   use your spirit to empower your church.
[01:57:33.780 --> 01:57:37.780]   Lord God, as we've been encouraged
[01:57:37.780 --> 01:57:42.780]   to move away from callousness to soberness,
[01:57:42.780 --> 01:57:46.780]   for we ask for brokenness day to day,
[01:57:46.780 --> 01:57:50.780]   an evaluation of where our heart is,
[01:57:50.780 --> 01:57:54.780]   must be done, Lord God, constantly,
[01:57:54.780 --> 01:57:59.780]   for we are prone to wander with so many distractions around us.
[01:57:59.780 --> 01:58:03.780]   Give us the strength that we need, that only you can provide.
[01:58:03.780 --> 01:58:06.780]   Lord God, help us to be sober-minded
[01:58:06.780 --> 01:58:10.780]   and not engage in things, Lord God, that will
[01:58:10.780 --> 01:58:12.780]   take us away from you.
[01:58:12.780 --> 01:58:18.780]   Lord, help us to be disciplined as well as empowered
[01:58:18.780 --> 01:58:22.780]   to dwell on whatever is good,
[01:58:22.780 --> 01:58:25.780]   whatever is perfect, whatever is ultimately your will.
[01:58:25.780 --> 01:58:29.780]   So I pray for our congregation,
[01:58:29.780 --> 01:58:34.780]   every person in this room, Lord God, that we walk out of this place
[01:58:34.780 --> 01:58:39.780]   filled with joy because we know, Lord God, that we are your children
[01:58:39.780 --> 01:58:43.780]   and that you are a faithful God who takes care of us
[01:58:43.780 --> 01:58:46.780]   and has been compassionate and loving towards us.
[01:58:46.780 --> 01:58:51.780]   Help us in return worship you and love you with all our heart, soul, mind, and strength.
[01:58:51.780 --> 01:58:56.780]   We thank you, Lord God, for this time it's in Christ's name we pray. Amen.
[01:58:56.780 --> 01:58:58.780]   You are dismissed.
[01:58:59.780 --> 01:59:01.780]   Oh.
[01:59:01.780 --> 01:59:07.780]   Can you, those of you, maybe help us put back some of the chairs that would be here.
