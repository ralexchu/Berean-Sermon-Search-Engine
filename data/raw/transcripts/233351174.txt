[00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:08.480]   We're going to be mainly focused on 11 and 12, but I want to read the context because
[00:00:08.480 --> 00:00:10.800]   it's been a couple of weeks since we've been here.
[00:00:10.800 --> 00:00:16.880]   Romans chapter 11 verses 1 and I'm going to read all 12 verses this morning.
[00:00:16.880 --> 00:00:20.240]   Romans chapter 11 verses 1 through 12.
[00:00:20.240 --> 00:00:22.680]   I asked then has God rejected his people?
[00:00:22.680 --> 00:00:26.920]   By no means for I myself am an Israelite, a descendant of Abraham, a member of the tribe
[00:00:26.920 --> 00:00:28.480]   of Benjamin.
[00:00:28.480 --> 00:00:30.840]   God has not rejected his people whom he foreknew.
[00:00:30.840 --> 00:00:35.360]   Do not know what the scripture says of Elijah, how he appeals to God against Israel.
[00:00:35.360 --> 00:00:37.460]   Lord, they have killed your prophets.
[00:00:37.460 --> 00:00:41.920]   They have demolished your altars and I alone am left and they seek my life.
[00:00:41.920 --> 00:00:43.280]   But what is God's reply to him?
[00:00:43.280 --> 00:00:48.440]   I have kept for myself 7,000 men who have not bowed the knee to Baal.
[00:00:48.440 --> 00:00:52.040]   So too at the present time there is a remnant chosen by grace.
[00:00:52.040 --> 00:00:55.320]   But if it is by grace, it is no longer on the basis of works.
[00:00:55.320 --> 00:00:58.040]   Otherwise grace would no longer be grace.
[00:00:58.040 --> 00:01:00.920]   But then Israel failed to obtain what it was seeking.
[00:01:00.920 --> 00:01:04.640]   They elect obtained it, but the rest were hardened as it is written.
[00:01:04.640 --> 00:01:08.920]   God gave them a spirit of stupor, eyes that would not see and ears that would not hear
[00:01:08.920 --> 00:01:10.760]   down to this very day.
[00:01:10.760 --> 00:01:15.180]   And David says, let their table become a snare and a trap, a stumbling block and a retribution
[00:01:15.180 --> 00:01:16.180]   for them.
[00:01:16.180 --> 00:01:20.560]   Let their eyes be darkened so that they cannot see and bend their backs forever.
[00:01:20.560 --> 00:01:24.040]   So I ask, did they stumble in order that they may not fall?
[00:01:24.040 --> 00:01:25.040]   By no means.
[00:01:25.040 --> 00:01:27.600]   But through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles.
[00:01:27.600 --> 00:01:29.800]   So as to make Israel jealous.
[00:01:29.800 --> 00:01:33.360]   Now if their trespass means riches for the world and if their failure means riches for
[00:01:33.360 --> 00:01:37.440]   the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion meet?
[00:01:37.440 --> 00:01:39.560]   Let's pray.
[00:01:39.560 --> 00:01:44.920]   Heavenly Father, we entrust this time to you.
[00:01:44.920 --> 00:01:49.040]   We ask that your word would judge the thoughts and intentions of our heart.
[00:01:49.040 --> 00:01:54.040]   Help us, Lord God, to glean from it what you have ordained through your word, that it would
[00:01:54.040 --> 00:01:57.880]   go forth, it would produce fruits before it returns.
[00:01:57.880 --> 00:01:59.520]   We ask, Lord God, that you would be with us.
[00:01:59.520 --> 00:02:01.520]   In Jesus' name we pray.
[00:02:01.520 --> 00:02:02.520]   Amen.
[00:02:02.520 --> 00:02:07.400]   You know, as we've been studying through the book of Romans in the last nine, ten, and
[00:02:07.400 --> 00:02:11.960]   elevens talking about Israel, and I know when we're talking about Israel, we can easily
[00:02:11.960 --> 00:02:17.360]   kind of check out and say, well, that doesn't seem a practical relevance to us other than,
[00:02:17.360 --> 00:02:21.040]   you know, it's interesting to know that God is still faithful to the nation of Israel,
[00:02:21.040 --> 00:02:24.280]   so what practical application does it have for us?
[00:02:24.280 --> 00:02:28.680]   Well Paul says in the book of Corinthians, he's writing to a church where all kinds of
[00:02:28.680 --> 00:02:30.920]   chaos is being allowed.
[00:02:30.920 --> 00:02:36.560]   They're divided, sexual immorality, their communion table is corrupt, and so he warns
[00:02:36.560 --> 00:02:42.720]   them and he uses the nation of Israel as an example, and he says in 1 Corinthians 10,
[00:02:42.720 --> 00:02:46.040]   I want you to know, brothers, that our fathers were all under the cloud, and he's talking
[00:02:46.040 --> 00:02:50.080]   about the nation of Israel, and all passed through the sea and all were baptized into
[00:02:50.080 --> 00:02:56.120]   Moses and he's saying basically all of them experienced the same grace of God and yet,
[00:02:56.120 --> 00:03:00.800]   in verse 5, nevertheless, with most of them, God was not pleased, for they were overthrown
[00:03:00.800 --> 00:03:01.800]   in the wilderness.
[00:03:01.800 --> 00:03:05.400]   Now these things took place as an example for us.
[00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:08.880]   Everything that God did with the nation of Israel, we are to look at it because it has
[00:03:08.880 --> 00:03:11.040]   ramifications on us.
[00:03:11.040 --> 00:03:15.160]   That we might not desire evil as they did, do not be idolaters as some of them were,
[00:03:15.160 --> 00:03:20.240]   as it is written, that people sat down to eat and drink and rose up to play.
[00:03:20.240 --> 00:03:23.440]   You know what's interesting here, one, first he says that everything that happened with
[00:03:23.440 --> 00:03:28.280]   the nation of Israel is relevant to us because they are an example of how God deals with
[00:03:28.280 --> 00:03:31.640]   his people, how God deals with sin.
[00:03:31.640 --> 00:03:36.160]   You know, but the thing that I want to highlight for you is that when God was bringing judgment
[00:03:36.160 --> 00:03:40.840]   upon the nation of Israel, the way God describes Israel is that they were just sitting down,
[00:03:40.840 --> 00:03:46.000]   eating and drinking and rose up to play.
[00:03:46.000 --> 00:03:48.160]   So their life was just mundane.
[00:03:48.160 --> 00:03:51.760]   Even though God was telling them that judgment was coming, their response was simply they
[00:03:51.760 --> 00:03:56.720]   were eating, drinking, and as if life was going to go on like the rest of the world.
[00:03:56.720 --> 00:04:02.920]   In fact, Jesus describes the judgment of Noah, the flood coming, and this is how he describes
[00:04:02.920 --> 00:04:07.920]   it, in Matthew 24, 36, "But concerning that day and hour, no one knows, not even the angels
[00:04:07.920 --> 00:04:11.140]   of heaven, nor the Son, but the Father only.
[00:04:11.140 --> 00:04:14.640]   As were the days of Noah, so will be the coming of the Son of Man.
[00:04:14.640 --> 00:04:18.880]   For as in those days before the flood they were eating and drinking, marrying and giving
[00:04:18.880 --> 00:04:23.340]   in marriage until the day when Noah entered the ark, and they were unaware until the flood
[00:04:23.340 --> 00:04:28.480]   came and swept them all away, so will be the coming of the Son of Man."
[00:04:28.480 --> 00:04:33.720]   We've been studying the end times in the book of Revelation, and the scripture constantly
[00:04:33.720 --> 00:04:40.320]   reminds us that the end times should not take us and surprise us like a thief coming to
[00:04:40.320 --> 00:04:41.320]   break into the house.
[00:04:41.320 --> 00:04:45.280]   He says the rest of the world is not going to be aware of it because they're not thinking
[00:04:45.280 --> 00:04:46.280]   about his coming.
[00:04:46.280 --> 00:04:48.880]   They're going to live as if this life is it.
[00:04:48.880 --> 00:04:52.960]   Even though Christian or non-Christian, we know that there's an end to life.
[00:04:52.960 --> 00:04:56.760]   Whether you live 100 years or whether you live 30 years or 40 years or even younger
[00:04:56.760 --> 00:05:02.240]   than that, it's a fact that death is imminent for everybody.
[00:05:02.240 --> 00:05:07.800]   But the scripture tells the church that we ought not to be overtaken by the second coming
[00:05:07.800 --> 00:05:10.520]   like the rest of the world.
[00:05:10.520 --> 00:05:14.920]   But again, Jesus describes that in the end before the coming of judgment, people are
[00:05:14.920 --> 00:05:16.480]   just going to be living like every other day.
[00:05:16.480 --> 00:05:21.900]   They're going to be eating, drinking, marrying, and it's like life is going to go on forever.
[00:05:21.900 --> 00:05:25.560]   There isn't this stirring of something's going to happen.
[00:05:25.560 --> 00:05:29.320]   You know what's interesting is I know that you guys know I was out in Asia for about
[00:05:29.320 --> 00:05:34.200]   a week and a half and I'm basically preaching with 10 hours of sleep this week.
[00:05:34.200 --> 00:05:35.600]   So I'm still sleep deprived.
[00:05:35.600 --> 00:05:40.620]   So if I say something weird, it's because I haven't been sleeping.
[00:05:40.620 --> 00:05:46.680]   But I was out in China and then I was out in Korea and last Sunday here at your time,
[00:05:46.680 --> 00:05:51.700]   but Saturday while I was in Korea, the nuclear bomb that they tested, the hydrogen bomb in
[00:05:51.700 --> 00:05:54.280]   North Korea, and I didn't feel the effects of it.
[00:05:54.280 --> 00:05:59.040]   I just heard about it because I turned on the news and it was on the news 24/7 about
[00:05:59.040 --> 00:06:01.640]   what was going on.
[00:06:01.640 --> 00:06:06.960]   And so that happened on Saturday and I walked out in the afternoon to go to the market to
[00:06:06.960 --> 00:06:11.360]   get something and it was one of those areas where it's just thousands of people, whether
[00:06:11.360 --> 00:06:17.880]   they're foreigners or locals out shopping, and they were filming one of those K-dramas
[00:06:17.880 --> 00:06:19.720]   out on the street.
[00:06:19.720 --> 00:06:23.560]   And I could tell because there was cameras everywhere and these are like a tall, good
[00:06:23.560 --> 00:06:31.320]   looking young man and fair skinned young Korean lady was having a conversation and I was like,
[00:06:31.320 --> 00:06:32.320]   "What's going on?
[00:06:32.320 --> 00:06:33.320]   Why this crowd?"
[00:06:33.320 --> 00:06:35.000]   And you could tell the directors were yelling at the whole crowd.
[00:06:35.000 --> 00:06:38.120]   And this was happening in the middle of hundreds of people just walking right in the middle.
[00:06:38.120 --> 00:06:39.320]   They set it up.
[00:06:39.320 --> 00:06:43.920]   And so we, and I ended up becoming an extra on the K-drama.
[00:06:43.920 --> 00:06:45.500]   Look for me, okay?
[00:06:45.500 --> 00:06:48.720]   So the director was yelling at all of us and he said, "Hey, stop looking at the camera.
[00:06:48.720 --> 00:06:49.720]   Keep walking."
[00:06:49.720 --> 00:06:50.800]   And obviously nobody did that.
[00:06:50.800 --> 00:06:53.160]   We were all just staring and said, "What is going on here?"
[00:06:53.160 --> 00:06:56.000]   So I might be on K-drama.
[00:06:56.000 --> 00:06:57.000]   I don't know.
[00:06:57.000 --> 00:06:59.280]   They're probably going to cut me out.
[00:06:59.280 --> 00:07:03.240]   But through the whole process, I was thinking, "Wow, you know, the news is going crazy about
[00:07:03.240 --> 00:07:05.600]   this hydrogen bomb."
[00:07:05.600 --> 00:07:11.320]   And for years, people have been concerned that if North Korea ever gets a hand on nuclear
[00:07:11.320 --> 00:07:16.000]   bomb that I don't think there's ever been a question that this regime is crazy enough
[00:07:16.000 --> 00:07:17.680]   to actually use it.
[00:07:17.680 --> 00:07:18.920]   So that's not a debate.
[00:07:18.920 --> 00:07:19.920]   No one is debating that.
[00:07:19.920 --> 00:07:21.880]   Would they be crazy enough to use this?
[00:07:21.880 --> 00:07:23.560]   I think that's not even a debate.
[00:07:23.560 --> 00:07:24.780]   They're crazy enough.
[00:07:24.780 --> 00:07:28.480]   If you look at the pattern of what they've been doing and how that country is and just
[00:07:28.480 --> 00:07:33.680]   getting rid of family members that threaten this regime, I don't think they're desperate
[00:07:33.680 --> 00:07:37.280]   enough where if they had it and they were provoked that they would actually use this
[00:07:37.280 --> 00:07:38.620]   bomb.
[00:07:38.620 --> 00:07:43.920]   And they've actually gone to the place where it's, I mean, clear proof that they have it.
[00:07:43.920 --> 00:07:45.720]   So now they're freaking out.
[00:07:45.720 --> 00:07:49.260]   You know, obviously they should be freaking out.
[00:07:49.260 --> 00:07:54.840]   We don't know exactly how this is going to be resolved, but it is a dangerous time.
[00:07:54.840 --> 00:07:58.420]   But as I was just walking down the street and as they were, you know, filming this thing
[00:07:58.420 --> 00:08:06.000]   and hundreds of thousands of people just walking around, just, just another threat.
[00:08:06.000 --> 00:08:10.120]   You know, Seoul, South Korea has been living under this threat for so many years.
[00:08:10.120 --> 00:08:12.520]   It's just kind of like, you know, they just do that.
[00:08:12.520 --> 00:08:15.000]   They're just rattling the cage again.
[00:08:15.000 --> 00:08:16.440]   Except this time is very different.
[00:08:16.440 --> 00:08:18.440]   Before it was a threat.
[00:08:18.440 --> 00:08:19.440]   It was just words.
[00:08:19.440 --> 00:08:22.920]   But now that they actually have the bomb, like kind of interesting to see what, how
[00:08:22.920 --> 00:08:26.200]   this is going to unfold.
[00:08:26.200 --> 00:08:32.500]   As crazy as that is, South Korea has become so numb to this threat.
[00:08:32.500 --> 00:08:39.960]   It's just whatever, you know, I mean, if this ever happens, if there's, if this conflict
[00:08:39.960 --> 00:08:43.400]   actually escalates to the next level, and I don't know what the next level might be,
[00:08:43.400 --> 00:08:47.680]   but other than the actual war itself, but if it actually escalates to the next level,
[00:08:47.680 --> 00:08:50.240]   South Korea, North Korea will be completely wiped out.
[00:08:50.240 --> 00:08:56.440]   I mean, forget the K-drama, the shopping, you know, all the, all the wealth that they've
[00:08:56.440 --> 00:08:58.400]   been working so hard to accumulate.
[00:08:58.400 --> 00:09:02.960]   I mean, I'm sure it's going to have effects even in the United States, but South Korea
[00:09:02.960 --> 00:09:07.080]   in particular, they're only miles away from the border.
[00:09:07.080 --> 00:09:11.160]   Instantly millions of people can be wiped out instantly.
[00:09:11.160 --> 00:09:14.160]   And this is not some fantasy.
[00:09:14.160 --> 00:09:17.800]   This is the reality that they're living under.
[00:09:17.800 --> 00:09:22.360]   But here's the reality as Christians that we need to remember, that whether the nuclear
[00:09:22.360 --> 00:09:28.880]   bomb goes off or doesn't go off, God has not lost control.
[00:09:28.880 --> 00:09:34.120]   That we are not to be rattled in our cages because a crazy man has gotten his hand on
[00:09:34.120 --> 00:09:36.320]   a hydrogen bomb.
[00:09:36.320 --> 00:09:40.640]   According to what we see in scripture, if God is a sovereign God, and if the hydrogen
[00:09:40.640 --> 00:09:47.240]   bomb does go off and millions of people are killed, our God is still sovereign.
[00:09:47.240 --> 00:09:51.920]   That nothing that's going to happen in human history is going to be outside of his will,
[00:09:51.920 --> 00:09:55.840]   where God's going to be shocked, "Oh my gosh, look what happened because he didn't pay attention
[00:09:55.840 --> 00:09:58.480]   for a few minutes."
[00:09:58.480 --> 00:10:04.980]   But what we do need to pay attention to are what is written in scripture.
[00:10:04.980 --> 00:10:11.480]   The man or the being who is absolutely in control of this judgment, whether he uses
[00:10:11.480 --> 00:10:18.880]   the means of a nuclear bomb or disaster or famine or hurricane, whatever it may be, that
[00:10:18.880 --> 00:10:22.600]   God says that there will be penalty for sin.
[00:10:22.600 --> 00:10:28.400]   And that the only resolution for this penalty is the blood of Christ.
[00:10:28.400 --> 00:10:33.240]   And that we are not to be caught off guard and to be rattled like the rest of the world.
[00:10:33.240 --> 00:10:40.780]   That we are no longer safe today or a year ago when they didn't have the hydrogen bomb.
[00:10:40.780 --> 00:10:45.620]   We are no longer more threatened today than when they did have the hydrogen bomb.
[00:10:45.620 --> 00:10:50.380]   Because we believe in a power much greater than the things that you and I can see.
[00:10:50.380 --> 00:10:53.640]   So we need to pay attention to what the scripture says.
[00:10:53.640 --> 00:10:55.440]   What does it say?
[00:10:55.440 --> 00:11:00.440]   And again, that we do not get caught off guard like those people in the time of Noah and
[00:11:00.440 --> 00:11:05.040]   like the Israelites, just eating and drinking and living as if everything is just going
[00:11:05.040 --> 00:11:09.000]   to go on forever.
[00:11:09.000 --> 00:11:14.440]   The nation of Israel, God is not done with the nation of Israel.
[00:11:14.440 --> 00:11:17.160]   And we've been talking about that in the text.
[00:11:17.160 --> 00:11:23.480]   That God, he says, has God rejected his people and he says, "By no means."
[00:11:23.480 --> 00:11:26.000]   Paul himself says he's an Israelite.
[00:11:26.000 --> 00:11:31.640]   He said, "God whom he foreknew, he ordained to love, he didn't all of a sudden quit on
[00:11:31.640 --> 00:11:32.640]   them.
[00:11:32.640 --> 00:11:38.800]   Though they experienced partially for a time being a hardening of their heart."
[00:11:38.800 --> 00:11:41.680]   Verse 11, "Have they stumbled to the point where they fell."
[00:11:41.680 --> 00:11:44.400]   Meaning that, are they done?
[00:11:44.400 --> 00:11:47.440]   If they are hardened now, is this permanent?
[00:11:47.440 --> 00:11:52.880]   And the answer to that again in verse 11 is, "By no means."
[00:11:52.880 --> 00:11:56.240]   Further, he says there's a clear purpose for that.
[00:11:56.240 --> 00:12:01.640]   That even in their hardening, even in their rejection of their Messiah, he says God has
[00:12:01.640 --> 00:12:02.640]   a purpose for that.
[00:12:02.640 --> 00:12:06.040]   He says, "Rather through their trespass, salvation has come to the Gentiles so as to
[00:12:06.040 --> 00:12:08.080]   make Israel jealous."
[00:12:08.080 --> 00:12:13.040]   So even in their rejection, it says God is sovereign.
[00:12:13.040 --> 00:12:17.680]   God has deliberately ordained that the gospel would go to the Gentiles and bring it to us
[00:12:17.680 --> 00:12:21.480]   through the hardening of the heart with the nation of Israel.
[00:12:21.480 --> 00:12:25.880]   I want to try to answer or at least deal with these two questions that come up in this text.
[00:12:25.880 --> 00:12:29.960]   One is, why does the failure of Israel lead to salvation of Gentiles?
[00:12:29.960 --> 00:12:37.400]   Why does God use this means to bring salvation to us, to the rest of the world?
[00:12:37.400 --> 00:12:41.200]   Why does Israel have to fail for the gospel to come to us?
[00:12:41.200 --> 00:12:43.280]   That's the first question.
[00:12:43.280 --> 00:12:49.080]   The second question that we ought to be asking and try to answer this morning, why does he
[00:12:49.080 --> 00:12:53.080]   provoke jealousy in the nation of Israel to bring them back to repentance?
[00:12:53.080 --> 00:12:59.800]   So it seems like his end goal is clear, but the means that he uses to get us there is
[00:12:59.800 --> 00:13:00.800]   a mystery.
[00:13:00.800 --> 00:13:02.160]   Like why does he use this mean?
[00:13:02.160 --> 00:13:06.120]   You would think that if God's intention was to bring salvation to the Gentiles, that he
[00:13:06.120 --> 00:13:07.120]   would just open the door.
[00:13:07.120 --> 00:13:09.480]   But why did he wait until Israel failed?
[00:13:09.480 --> 00:13:13.760]   And he said their failure meant that now the gospel is open to the Gentiles.
[00:13:13.760 --> 00:13:18.440]   And if his goal is to bring Israel back to repentance, why does he use this means of
[00:13:18.440 --> 00:13:22.840]   provoking them to jealousy to bring them back to repentance?
[00:13:22.840 --> 00:13:26.040]   So we're going to try to answer these two questions this morning.
[00:13:26.040 --> 00:13:28.600]   One, why does he use this mean?
[00:13:28.600 --> 00:13:32.840]   Why does he wait until Israel fails before he brings them to salvation?
[00:13:32.840 --> 00:13:38.360]   Clearly salvation to the Gentile is not plan B. He wasn't trying to be glorified to the
[00:13:38.360 --> 00:13:42.760]   nation of Israel and because they rejected, now he's going to go and go to the highways
[00:13:42.760 --> 00:13:45.080]   and byways and now he's going to bring the Gentiles on.
[00:13:45.080 --> 00:13:48.260]   That's not how it's explained in the scripture.
[00:13:48.260 --> 00:13:52.840]   From the very get go, his intention was to bring the gospel to the Gentiles.
[00:13:52.840 --> 00:13:59.000]   Genesis chapter 12, 3, as he makes a covenant with Abraham, he makes it very clear from
[00:13:59.000 --> 00:14:04.320]   the very beginning, his intention was that through Abraham, that all the nations will
[00:14:04.320 --> 00:14:05.840]   be able to hear the gospel.
[00:14:05.840 --> 00:14:11.040]   Genesis 12, 3, "I will bless those who bless you and him who dishonors you, I will curse
[00:14:11.040 --> 00:14:15.200]   and in you all the families of the earth shall be blessed."
[00:14:15.200 --> 00:14:19.940]   So very inception of the nation of Israel, God's intent was to use them to get the gospel
[00:14:19.940 --> 00:14:20.940]   out to them.
[00:14:20.940 --> 00:14:25.300]   Psalm 22, 27, "All the ends of the earth shall remember and turn to the Lord and all
[00:14:25.300 --> 00:14:29.660]   the families of the nations shall worship before you."
[00:14:29.660 --> 00:14:33.860]   Again in Zechariah 2, 11, "And many nations shall join themselves to the Lord in that
[00:14:33.860 --> 00:14:38.180]   day and shall be my people and I will dwell in your midst and you shall know that the
[00:14:38.180 --> 00:14:40.300]   Lord of hosts has sent me to you."
[00:14:40.300 --> 00:14:45.060]   I could have chosen dozens and dozens of passages that I could have added to this that could
[00:14:45.060 --> 00:14:50.640]   have clearly states, that clearly states that the salvation to the Gentile was not plan
[00:14:50.640 --> 00:14:51.640]   B.
[00:14:51.640 --> 00:14:55.480]   It's not because Israel failed, now he's giving up on them, now he's going to go to
[00:14:55.480 --> 00:14:56.480]   the world.
[00:14:56.480 --> 00:15:03.280]   He says from the very beginning, his intent was through them that he was going to be glorified.
[00:15:03.280 --> 00:15:09.520]   If that was the case, why does he use the means of a failure of one nation to bring
[00:15:09.520 --> 00:15:13.360]   the salvation to the other?
[00:15:13.360 --> 00:15:22.880]   In Galatians 4, 4 and Ephesians 1, 10, Paul says that Christ came at the fullness of time,
[00:15:22.880 --> 00:15:27.240]   meaning at God's ordained time, that it was the perfect time, that God was waiting for
[00:15:27.240 --> 00:15:28.480]   that time to happen.
[00:15:28.480 --> 00:15:33.120]   So typically when we think about the fullness of time for the gospel to come, we think of
[00:15:33.120 --> 00:15:34.120]   human means.
[00:15:34.120 --> 00:15:39.960]   He didn't wait until Alexander the Great had to grow up and he needed to conquer the
[00:15:39.960 --> 00:15:45.760]   nations, that he needed to unify the culture and the Greek language, and then they needed
[00:15:45.760 --> 00:15:51.480]   to wait until Rome came into power and then overthrew them and then united all the kingdoms
[00:15:51.480 --> 00:15:55.840]   so that the roads would be connected to each other, there would be cultural unity, they
[00:15:55.840 --> 00:15:57.000]   would be able to understand each other.
[00:15:57.000 --> 00:16:00.320]   So all of these things were necessary so when the gospel came that they could go to these
[00:16:00.320 --> 00:16:01.880]   places and preach the gospel.
[00:16:01.880 --> 00:16:06.120]   Now a lot of times we think about that maybe that's what God was waiting for, but there's
[00:16:06.120 --> 00:16:08.760]   no mention of any of that.
[00:16:08.760 --> 00:16:12.680]   All of that is just human conjecture when it says fullness of time, that all the cultural
[00:16:12.680 --> 00:16:15.040]   language and all of these things have to take place.
[00:16:15.040 --> 00:16:18.840]   Again, that's all just human rationale.
[00:16:18.840 --> 00:16:20.800]   Bible mentions none of that.
[00:16:20.800 --> 00:16:27.080]   I'm not saying that all of that stuff didn't contribute to the gospel being spread, but
[00:16:27.080 --> 00:16:34.160]   what the scripture clearly states what the fullness of time was, he said that the law
[00:16:34.160 --> 00:16:40.880]   was given so that sin would become utterly sinful.
[00:16:40.880 --> 00:16:47.960]   He was waiting for the sin of Israel to have its full effect, and that's clearly stated
[00:16:47.960 --> 00:16:48.960]   in scripture.
[00:16:48.960 --> 00:16:54.800]   He was waiting for the hardening of the nation of Israel to have its full effect, that they
[00:16:54.800 --> 00:16:59.480]   would be hardened, not just partially, but to the point where even the Messiah that they've
[00:16:59.480 --> 00:17:03.760]   been talking about and waiting for for hundreds and hundreds of years, that even as he stood
[00:17:03.760 --> 00:17:08.440]   before them performing miracles, they would be so blind and so hardened that they wouldn't
[00:17:08.440 --> 00:17:09.600]   even be able to recognize him.
[00:17:09.600 --> 00:17:14.880]   Not only did they not recognize him, they were so deep into their hypocrisy.
[00:17:14.880 --> 00:17:20.760]   They were so deep into their own sins and hardening of their own heart, they ended up
[00:17:20.760 --> 00:17:25.840]   crucifying the very Messiah that they were telling each other every single day.
[00:17:25.840 --> 00:17:27.880]   Messiah's going to come.
[00:17:27.880 --> 00:17:30.700]   Messiah's going to come.
[00:17:30.700 --> 00:17:36.780]   So all of these external things obviously can be superficially, it could be helpful,
[00:17:36.780 --> 00:17:43.740]   but the scripture clearly states that God allowed sin to run its course.
[00:17:43.740 --> 00:17:49.320]   He allowed sin to run its course so that those who are hardened would continue to be hardened.
[00:17:49.320 --> 00:17:58.560]   Those who are rebellious would take the rebellion to its full effect because until sin becomes
[00:17:58.560 --> 00:18:06.160]   utterly sinful, his grace doesn't become utterly gracious.
[00:18:06.160 --> 00:18:10.320]   That's true with every single one of us.
[00:18:10.320 --> 00:18:14.120]   You know, the people who, like Jesus said, those who have been forgiven most, those are
[00:18:14.120 --> 00:18:20.800]   the ones who love most, sometimes God will allow a hardening of our heart to take its
[00:18:20.800 --> 00:18:24.400]   full effect because God doesn't want partial worship.
[00:18:24.400 --> 00:18:27.160]   If you're going to give partial worship, God's going to allow you to just kind of keep going
[00:18:27.160 --> 00:18:31.560]   down that path until we are hardened to the point where you feel nothing.
[00:18:31.560 --> 00:18:34.760]   The Word of God doesn't penetrate into your heart anymore because until we've gotten to
[00:18:34.760 --> 00:18:42.160]   the point where it's become so dark, we don't recognize the light even when the light comes.
[00:18:42.160 --> 00:18:44.680]   Even when the Word of God is preached, we don't recognize it as God.
[00:18:44.680 --> 00:18:47.240]   We can't, we don't discern if it is from God or not.
[00:18:47.240 --> 00:18:52.720]   So God deliberately allows darkness to get utterly dark.
[00:18:52.720 --> 00:18:56.000]   That's why when Jesus came, it was ordained.
[00:18:56.000 --> 00:18:57.000]   He volunteered.
[00:18:57.000 --> 00:18:59.200]   He says, "Nobody takes my life.
[00:18:59.200 --> 00:19:01.640]   I lay it down and I take it back up."
[00:19:01.640 --> 00:19:07.600]   And yet, the whole purpose of why even Scripture was written, you know that the seed of the
[00:19:07.600 --> 00:19:12.680]   man, seed of the woman would come and crush the head of the serpent to bring salvation.
[00:19:12.680 --> 00:19:17.200]   So the whole Israel's history and their genealogy was for Jesus to come.
[00:19:17.200 --> 00:19:22.040]   And how many times does Jesus say in his ministry, "It is to fulfill all prophecy."
[00:19:22.040 --> 00:19:23.040]   He was born in Bethlehem.
[00:19:23.040 --> 00:19:26.640]   He was born of a virgin.
[00:19:26.640 --> 00:19:28.160]   He was baptized.
[00:19:28.160 --> 00:19:29.880]   He's riding in on a donkey.
[00:19:29.880 --> 00:19:33.720]   He quotes Isaiah to say, "Today this is going to be fulfilled in you."
[00:19:33.720 --> 00:19:39.260]   He clearly states he's the Messiah and everything that he does, he said, "It's to fulfill prophecy."
[00:19:39.260 --> 00:19:45.600]   So it was God ordained that he was going to come and give his life for the sins of many.
[00:19:45.600 --> 00:19:53.960]   And yet, he also says he's going to die in the hands of the leaders of Israel.
[00:19:53.960 --> 00:19:58.840]   And even his disciples betraying him was prophesied.
[00:19:58.840 --> 00:20:01.520]   Even Judas was not a mistake.
[00:20:01.520 --> 00:20:06.120]   His failure and his betrayal of his master was also prophesied.
[00:20:06.120 --> 00:20:15.000]   Why does God use these human failures even as this was ordained and volunteered?
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.480]   See God allows darkness to take its full effect.
[00:20:19.480 --> 00:20:22.720]   He allows sin to become utterly sinful.
[00:20:22.720 --> 00:20:28.360]   In Romans 5.20, Paul explained earlier, he said, "Now the law came into increase to trespass,
[00:20:28.360 --> 00:20:34.440]   but where sin increased, grace abounded all the more."
[00:20:34.440 --> 00:20:38.000]   Part of the reason why the scripture says why it is difficult for a rich man to enter
[00:20:38.000 --> 00:20:43.880]   the kingdom of heaven is because a rich man is not desperate.
[00:20:43.880 --> 00:20:48.720]   That's a deception of where you and I live.
[00:20:48.720 --> 00:20:52.160]   And again, every single one of us, I'm filthy rich.
[00:20:52.160 --> 00:20:53.160]   I'm filthy rich.
[00:20:53.160 --> 00:20:55.520]   And you're filthy rich.
[00:20:55.520 --> 00:20:58.780]   In comparison to the rest of the world.
[00:20:58.780 --> 00:21:01.280]   We don't, we're not desperate.
[00:21:01.280 --> 00:21:03.360]   Let's be honest, we're not desperate.
[00:21:03.360 --> 00:21:08.720]   And so the deception of where you and I live with all the blessings that we have is that
[00:21:08.720 --> 00:21:12.920]   we have to constantly remind ourselves how desperate we are.
[00:21:12.920 --> 00:21:17.320]   Because the scripture tells us that a man living in a mansion versus a man living in
[00:21:17.320 --> 00:21:23.760]   a hut is no more safer and no better off in the presence of God.
[00:21:23.760 --> 00:21:29.140]   That he is just as poor and wretched in the eyes of God than the worst of sinners.
[00:21:29.140 --> 00:21:36.200]   But that's the deception of being rich, of being moral, of going to church, is because
[00:21:36.200 --> 00:21:41.840]   we are deceived to think that we're better off.
[00:21:41.840 --> 00:21:47.320]   God allows sin to become utterly sinful because until we recognize sin as sin in the presence
[00:21:47.320 --> 00:21:56.720]   of a holy God, and until he allows sin to have its full effect, our religion just becomes
[00:21:56.720 --> 00:21:59.060]   something to do.
[00:21:59.060 --> 00:22:00.240]   It becomes maybe even superstitious.
[00:22:00.240 --> 00:22:04.680]   I have to go to church or else God's not going to bless my business or my family or, you
[00:22:04.680 --> 00:22:07.960]   know, it's part of sociology or psychology.
[00:22:07.960 --> 00:22:10.180]   This is why we do what we do.
[00:22:10.180 --> 00:22:14.280]   But how much of it is because God saved wretched sinners?
[00:22:14.280 --> 00:22:18.080]   I mean, we all know how to say that.
[00:22:18.080 --> 00:22:21.960]   But is that why you're worshiping this morning?
[00:22:21.960 --> 00:22:27.120]   Is that what caused you to when you see the words up on the screen, "Bless the Lord,
[00:22:27.120 --> 00:22:30.720]   O my soul"?
[00:22:30.720 --> 00:22:35.760]   Are those words that you repeated, do you just like the rhythm?
[00:22:35.760 --> 00:22:42.880]   Or is that a sinner in a wretched state that has been saved and as a result of that you
[00:22:42.880 --> 00:22:48.360]   can't help but to cry out, "Bless the Lord, O my soul"?
[00:22:48.360 --> 00:22:55.800]   God allowed sin to take its full effect in the nation of Israel.
[00:22:55.800 --> 00:23:01.320]   The greatest hindrance to salvation is almost always pride.
[00:23:01.320 --> 00:23:06.600]   Because the first thing that the gospel says is that we are needy.
[00:23:06.600 --> 00:23:08.080]   We're wretched sinners in need of forgiveness.
[00:23:08.080 --> 00:23:11.760]   That's the first thing that it says, that everything that you were thinking was wrong.
[00:23:11.760 --> 00:23:14.320]   What you've been pursuing was wrong.
[00:23:14.320 --> 00:23:17.020]   What made you happy was wrong.
[00:23:17.020 --> 00:23:20.780]   How you evaluated the value of people was wrong.
[00:23:20.780 --> 00:23:22.400]   How you invested your money was wrong.
[00:23:22.400 --> 00:23:25.460]   What entertained you was wrong.
[00:23:25.460 --> 00:23:30.560]   What preoccupied your mornings and night, it was wrong.
[00:23:30.560 --> 00:23:36.680]   We were outside of the will of God, living our own lives, seeking our own glory.
[00:23:36.680 --> 00:23:39.000]   And when we first hear the gospel, it says, "No, we were wrong."
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.680]   It brings us to repentance.
[00:23:41.680 --> 00:23:46.280]   It causes a beat on our chest like that tax collector, "I am worthy to even look up to
[00:23:46.280 --> 00:23:48.440]   you."
[00:23:48.440 --> 00:23:53.920]   God allows sin to become utterly sinful because until we get to that point of darkness, our
[00:23:53.920 --> 00:23:58.320]   worship will always be superficial.
[00:23:58.320 --> 00:24:02.960]   Be something that is good to have, but not a necessity.
[00:24:02.960 --> 00:24:08.520]   See, God uses the failure of Israel to display His glory.
[00:24:08.520 --> 00:24:13.000]   We know that God chose a nation of Israel that they would display His glory, but if
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.920]   you look at the history of Israel, it wasn't at the peak of their success where God was
[00:24:16.920 --> 00:24:17.920]   glorified.
[00:24:17.920 --> 00:24:18.920]   Right?
[00:24:18.920 --> 00:24:19.920]   It wasn't.
[00:24:19.920 --> 00:24:22.280]   Because they were constantly failing.
[00:24:22.280 --> 00:24:28.040]   There are few periods in Israel's history where you can look at them and say, "Wow."
[00:24:28.040 --> 00:24:29.720]   Look at what God is doing.
[00:24:29.720 --> 00:24:31.240]   Look how much they are worshiping God.
[00:24:31.240 --> 00:24:35.840]   In fact, the majority of the time, God's glory was displayed in the midst of their
[00:24:35.840 --> 00:24:39.560]   failure while God was bringing judgment.
[00:24:39.560 --> 00:24:42.560]   He promises restoration.
[00:24:42.560 --> 00:24:48.200]   When you first read the Old Testament, your first response is, "Man, God is vengeful.
[00:24:48.200 --> 00:24:51.960]   He says He's going to bring judgment, and He actually brings judgment over and over
[00:24:51.960 --> 00:24:54.040]   and over when you read it superficially."
[00:24:54.040 --> 00:24:58.320]   But when you take your time to read through what is happening behind the scenes, not just
[00:24:58.320 --> 00:25:02.520]   the judgment, but what caused this judgment, you can't help but to think, "Why are
[00:25:02.520 --> 00:25:06.520]   you so merciful with this nation?
[00:25:06.520 --> 00:25:09.600]   Why do you forgive them over and over and over and over?"
[00:25:09.600 --> 00:25:16.600]   They just won't learn, even as they are being taken into captivity.
[00:25:16.600 --> 00:25:19.920]   He says, "Enough!"
[00:25:19.920 --> 00:25:23.680]   Even in that context, He says, "Yet I am not done with you."
[00:25:23.680 --> 00:25:26.600]   There's going to come a time when He's going to make a new covenant, and He's going
[00:25:26.600 --> 00:25:31.880]   to place His Word and His Spirit inside of you, so no one has to teach you, even in the
[00:25:31.880 --> 00:25:34.400]   context of judgment.
[00:25:34.400 --> 00:25:37.880]   So if you look at the nation of Israel, God clearly was glorified through the nation of
[00:25:37.880 --> 00:25:42.560]   Israel, but it wasn't when they were righteous.
[00:25:42.560 --> 00:25:44.600]   It was when they were desperate.
[00:25:44.600 --> 00:25:46.280]   They had no hope.
[00:25:46.280 --> 00:25:52.000]   And even as we are reading it through the eyes of the outsiders, you almost demand,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:56.680]   "God, be just and move on."
[00:25:56.680 --> 00:26:01.040]   Yet He is merciful, and He is gracious.
[00:26:01.040 --> 00:26:09.000]   That's where you and I come in, that all of this is evidence of His grace to us.
[00:26:09.000 --> 00:26:13.040]   Even as the nation of Israel experienced the hardening of their heart partially, He says
[00:26:13.040 --> 00:26:19.680]   in verse 12, "Now if their trespass means riches for the world, and if their failure
[00:26:19.680 --> 00:26:26.240]   means riches for the Gentiles, how much more will their full inclusion mean?"
[00:26:26.240 --> 00:26:34.520]   In other words, if His grace has gone to us, even as they failed, how much more of His
[00:26:34.520 --> 00:26:39.840]   grace will you experience when they actually are restored?
[00:26:39.840 --> 00:26:49.040]   See, if this is the case, if grace abounds in our failure, the natural response in Romans
[00:26:49.040 --> 00:26:52.880]   3, 5, 6 is, "But if our unrighteousness serves to show the righteousness of God, what shall
[00:26:52.880 --> 00:26:53.880]   we say?
[00:26:53.880 --> 00:26:57.120]   That God is unrighteous to inflict wrath on us?"
[00:26:57.120 --> 00:26:58.800]   Paul says, "By no means."
[00:26:58.800 --> 00:27:01.920]   Again, in Romans 6, 1-2, "What shall we say then?
[00:27:01.920 --> 00:27:04.360]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?"
[00:27:04.360 --> 00:27:07.040]   He says, "By no means."
[00:27:07.040 --> 00:27:14.520]   You know, there's two ways to wrongly respond to the gospel message and its grace.
[00:27:14.520 --> 00:27:18.880]   One is, and obviously we're always trying to earn, we're always like, "What should
[00:27:18.880 --> 00:27:19.880]   I do?"
[00:27:19.880 --> 00:27:24.680]   And you're always doing the right things, thinking that somehow when you're doing good,
[00:27:24.680 --> 00:27:27.480]   you walk around stiff-necked, like, "Nobody's like me.
[00:27:27.480 --> 00:27:29.600]   How come nobody's righteous like me?"
[00:27:29.600 --> 00:27:34.000]   That's probably one of the, you know, it's the ugliest people to be around are self-righteous
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:36.200]   people, right?
[00:27:36.200 --> 00:27:37.200]   Nobody's like me.
[00:27:37.200 --> 00:27:38.680]   Nobody memorized scripture like me.
[00:27:38.680 --> 00:27:39.680]   Nobody serves like I do.
[00:27:39.680 --> 00:27:44.080]   Nobody, they're the ugliest group to be around, right?
[00:27:44.080 --> 00:27:47.040]   You know what I'm talking about.
[00:27:47.040 --> 00:27:50.720]   And don't say, "Yeah, those people, those people."
[00:27:50.720 --> 00:27:51.840]   We're all guilty of that.
[00:27:51.840 --> 00:27:54.760]   We are all guilty of, you know, when we're usually good at something.
[00:27:54.760 --> 00:28:00.480]   If you happen to be good at serving, you know, those people who don't serve.
[00:28:00.480 --> 00:28:03.600]   If you happen to be good at praying, those people don't pray.
[00:28:03.600 --> 00:28:08.760]   If you happen to be good at missions and sharing the gospel, oh, you know, those people don't
[00:28:08.760 --> 00:28:09.760]   share the gospel.
[00:28:09.760 --> 00:28:13.260]   Hey, there's self-righteousness in all of us.
[00:28:13.260 --> 00:28:17.440]   The other end of it is that we become so flippant with grace.
[00:28:17.440 --> 00:28:23.560]   Well, if, you know, sin, grace abounds more if there's more sin, then let us sin that
[00:28:23.560 --> 00:28:26.200]   grace may abound.
[00:28:26.200 --> 00:28:28.440]   Paul responds to that in Romans 6, 1-5.
[00:28:28.440 --> 00:28:29.440]   What shall we say then?
[00:28:29.440 --> 00:28:31.760]   Are we to continue in sin that grace may abound?
[00:28:31.760 --> 00:28:33.600]   By no means.
[00:28:33.600 --> 00:28:36.520]   How can we who died to sin still live in it?
[00:28:36.520 --> 00:28:40.560]   Do you not know that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus were baptized into
[00:28:40.560 --> 00:28:42.400]   His death?
[00:28:42.400 --> 00:28:44.720]   That grace wasn't just grace and just panned out candy.
[00:28:44.720 --> 00:28:47.280]   He said, no, we have been crucified with Christ.
[00:28:47.280 --> 00:28:50.520]   In other words, our old self died when Christ died.
[00:28:50.520 --> 00:28:56.280]   And then verse 4, we were buried therefore with Him by baptism into death in order that
[00:28:56.280 --> 00:28:59.860]   just as Christ was raised from the dead by the glory of the Father, we too might walk
[00:28:59.860 --> 00:29:01.600]   in a newness of life.
[00:29:01.600 --> 00:29:06.100]   For we have been united with Him in a death like His, we shall certainly be united with
[00:29:06.100 --> 00:29:08.880]   Him in a resurrection like His.
[00:29:08.880 --> 00:29:12.600]   If you respond to the grace of God saying, let us sin that grace may abound, you miss
[00:29:12.600 --> 00:29:14.440]   the whole point of salvation.
[00:29:14.440 --> 00:29:18.880]   The whole point of salvation is to deliver us from an empty way of life that we could
[00:29:18.880 --> 00:29:21.600]   not deliver ourselves from.
[00:29:21.600 --> 00:29:25.240]   Someone who is dead in his trespasses all of a sudden does not make a decision saying,
[00:29:25.240 --> 00:29:27.960]   I'm not going to be dead today.
[00:29:27.960 --> 00:29:35.840]   The whole point of salvation is to take us from death and sin and to give us an opportunity
[00:29:35.840 --> 00:29:37.380]   to live a new life.
[00:29:37.380 --> 00:29:42.360]   So it completely contradicts the gospel for us to say, let us sin that grace may abound.
[00:29:42.360 --> 00:29:44.920]   And that's basically what the argument Paul is making.
[00:29:44.920 --> 00:29:52.860]   If you've truly been saved, we would understand that our salvation means a newness of life.
[00:29:52.860 --> 00:30:00.960]   So one, the first question, He saves us, but first He allows sin to become utterly sinful.
[00:30:00.960 --> 00:30:04.320]   And He uses that to demonstrate His grace.
[00:30:04.320 --> 00:30:09.240]   The second question is, why does God arouse jealousy to bring about repentance of His
[00:30:09.240 --> 00:30:10.240]   people?
[00:30:10.240 --> 00:30:16.920]   Jealousy, typically when we think about it in our culture, is not a good thing.
[00:30:16.920 --> 00:30:24.920]   If somebody says, wow, Pastor Peter is really jealous, you say, wow, that's a good qualification
[00:30:24.920 --> 00:30:25.920]   of an elder.
[00:30:25.920 --> 00:30:27.640]   So he's jealous about everything.
[00:30:27.640 --> 00:30:32.840]   I'm jealous of your shoes, of your car, your relationship.
[00:30:32.840 --> 00:30:35.920]   Everybody thinks of the way we use the term jealous as a good thing.
[00:30:35.920 --> 00:30:41.320]   The Bible, the word jealous basically means passion, to have zeal.
[00:30:41.320 --> 00:30:47.000]   So the Greek word for jealous here is para-zealous.
[00:30:47.000 --> 00:30:49.040]   And the word para basically means to provoke.
[00:30:49.040 --> 00:30:53.400]   So some of your translations actually says that God is using the failure of Israel and
[00:30:53.400 --> 00:30:58.200]   gospel to the Gentiles to provoke jealousy among His people.
[00:30:58.200 --> 00:30:59.460]   Passion.
[00:30:59.460 --> 00:31:02.120]   The word in and of itself is neutral.
[00:31:02.120 --> 00:31:05.120]   It can be used positive or negative.
[00:31:05.120 --> 00:31:09.360]   So Galatians 5, 19-20 uses negatively and it says, "Now the works of the flesh are
[00:31:09.360 --> 00:31:15.600]   evidence sexual immorality, impurity, sensuality, idolatry, sorcery, enmity, strife, jealousy,
[00:31:15.600 --> 00:31:16.600]   and fits of anger."
[00:31:16.600 --> 00:31:22.400]   So here clearly, when you're coveting something that doesn't belong to you, it's negative.
[00:31:22.400 --> 00:31:24.260]   God doesn't want you to have it.
[00:31:24.260 --> 00:31:27.520]   It's actually detrimental to you and it's not yours.
[00:31:27.520 --> 00:31:30.840]   So if you're jealous or coveting something that doesn't belong to you, obviously it is
[00:31:30.840 --> 00:31:31.840]   negative.
[00:31:31.840 --> 00:31:35.120]   You're talking about something that is not yours.
[00:31:35.120 --> 00:31:39.440]   So if we're jealous and coveting the world, it's negative.
[00:31:39.440 --> 00:31:41.440]   The scripture says, "Thou shalt not covet."
[00:31:41.440 --> 00:31:43.140]   Because it's not yours.
[00:31:43.140 --> 00:31:44.960]   It doesn't belong to you.
[00:31:44.960 --> 00:31:46.700]   God never gave it to you.
[00:31:46.700 --> 00:31:51.360]   So when we covet the things that God never intended to give to us and does not belong
[00:31:51.360 --> 00:31:54.320]   to us, then it becomes negative.
[00:31:54.320 --> 00:32:03.280]   But coveting and jealousy in the context of God's will is actually righteousness.
[00:32:03.280 --> 00:32:07.120]   Let me tell you what I mean by that.
[00:32:07.120 --> 00:32:14.520]   God forbid, but if my wife that I've been married to for over 25 years found out, again
[00:32:14.520 --> 00:32:20.480]   this is God forbid, so don't wake up now and just hear this part, okay?
[00:32:20.480 --> 00:32:25.880]   God forbid if my wife, I found out for the last 20 years has been involved in a secret
[00:32:25.880 --> 00:32:30.520]   chat room with this guy and all the time that she's been telling me that she was at Target
[00:32:30.520 --> 00:32:33.960]   was hanging out with this guy, right?
[00:32:33.960 --> 00:32:39.960]   And spending all our time sharing all our secrets and spending all our money to connect
[00:32:39.960 --> 00:32:41.120]   with this guy.
[00:32:41.120 --> 00:32:46.040]   And then I found out about it and then you come and ask, "Oh my gosh, I can't believe
[00:32:46.040 --> 00:32:47.040]   that happened."
[00:32:47.040 --> 00:32:49.000]   And you come and ask, "So how do you feel?"
[00:32:49.000 --> 00:32:53.600]   And I tell you, "Whatever."
[00:32:53.600 --> 00:32:59.000]   How many of you would look at that response and say, "Wow, he's really a righteous
[00:32:59.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   man.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:03.760]   It doesn't bother him at all."
[00:33:03.760 --> 00:33:05.360]   Is that a good quality to have?
[00:33:05.360 --> 00:33:06.360]   No.
[00:33:06.360 --> 00:33:10.000]   Immediately you would think, "What's wrong with your marriage?
[00:33:10.000 --> 00:33:11.360]   Why would that not bother you?
[00:33:11.360 --> 00:33:13.400]   How come that doesn't make you jealous?
[00:33:13.400 --> 00:33:14.920]   Aren't you angered by that?"
[00:33:14.920 --> 00:33:21.880]   Because you would expect if the marriage was what it should be that you're supposed
[00:33:21.880 --> 00:33:22.880]   to be jealous.
[00:33:22.880 --> 00:33:26.520]   So if I'm not jealous, if I see that my wife is doing something, is connecting with
[00:33:26.520 --> 00:33:30.080]   somebody that she shouldn't be connecting with, that belongs to me, and she gives herself
[00:33:30.080 --> 00:33:34.200]   to somebody else, I should be jealous.
[00:33:34.200 --> 00:33:39.040]   Jealousy means I care.
[00:33:39.040 --> 00:33:42.760]   Because I love her, I covet her.
[00:33:42.760 --> 00:33:48.080]   So when the Scripture describes God's love for His people, He uses the strongest term
[00:33:48.080 --> 00:33:53.600]   that He can use to say that He cares for His nation.
[00:33:53.600 --> 00:33:58.080]   In Exodus 25, it says, "You should not bow down to them or serve them, for I, the Lord
[00:33:58.080 --> 00:34:01.520]   your God, am a jealous God."
[00:34:01.520 --> 00:34:07.720]   When you understand in the context of what God is saying, that there is a covenant relationship.
[00:34:07.720 --> 00:34:13.840]   God made a unilateral covenant to love the nation of Israel unconditionally.
[00:34:13.840 --> 00:34:16.400]   He says, "You belong to me.
[00:34:16.400 --> 00:34:20.360]   I have chosen you, not because you are numerous, not because you are more righteous than any
[00:34:20.360 --> 00:34:25.880]   other nation, but I have just simply chosen to love you."
[00:34:25.880 --> 00:34:28.280]   And that's why He describes His love for them as jealousy.
[00:34:28.280 --> 00:34:33.160]   Zechariah 1.14, "I am exceedingly jealous for Jerusalem and for Zion."
[00:34:33.160 --> 00:34:38.640]   Remember when Jesus was turning tables over at the temple?
[00:34:38.640 --> 00:34:44.520]   The disciples remember later on a prophecy in the Scripture that the Messiah, the zeal
[00:34:44.520 --> 00:34:47.760]   for the Lord's house, would consume Him.
[00:34:47.760 --> 00:34:54.480]   Passion, jealousy, coveting, what belongs to Him.
[00:34:54.480 --> 00:35:00.680]   As Paul says in 2 Corinthians 11.2, "I feel a divine jealousy for you, for I betrothed
[00:35:00.680 --> 00:35:06.560]   you to one husband to present you as a pure virgin to Christ."
[00:35:06.560 --> 00:35:09.960]   Jealousy or coveting, something that doesn't belong to us, that God didn't give to us,
[00:35:09.960 --> 00:35:11.640]   is sinful.
[00:35:11.640 --> 00:35:15.880]   But coveting and jealousy is expected.
[00:35:15.880 --> 00:35:20.320]   In fact, it would be strange not to have that.
[00:35:20.320 --> 00:35:26.680]   That's why in Deuteronomy 32.21, God says, "They have made me jealous with what is not
[00:35:26.680 --> 00:35:27.680]   God.
[00:35:27.680 --> 00:35:31.600]   They have provoked me to anger with their idols, so I will make them jealous with those
[00:35:31.600 --> 00:35:36.080]   who are no people, and I will provoke them to anger with a foolish nation."
[00:35:36.080 --> 00:35:43.160]   Now, the point of all of this, obviously, one, it describes His love for His people.
[00:35:43.160 --> 00:35:48.000]   But the reason why He's trying to provoke jealousy among the nation of Israel is because
[00:35:48.000 --> 00:35:55.700]   God does not simply want Israel to stop doing bad things and do good things.
[00:35:55.700 --> 00:36:01.140]   The reason why He describes Israel's repentance as provoking to jealousy is because He is
[00:36:01.140 --> 00:36:02.280]   jealous for them.
[00:36:02.280 --> 00:36:05.860]   So He wants them to be jealous for Him.
[00:36:05.860 --> 00:36:12.220]   He wants that love that He gave to His people to return to Him in love.
[00:36:12.220 --> 00:36:14.960]   He doesn't want people just to come in, check in, and check out.
[00:36:14.960 --> 00:36:19.580]   That's why He says He doesn't care whether you worship here or there.
[00:36:19.580 --> 00:36:22.220]   He's looking for people who will worship Him in spirit and in truth.
[00:36:22.220 --> 00:36:23.360]   What is He saying?
[00:36:23.360 --> 00:36:26.220]   He wants people to be jealous for Him.
[00:36:26.220 --> 00:36:28.040]   What is the greatest commandment?
[00:36:28.040 --> 00:36:29.600]   Which commandment should we do?
[00:36:29.600 --> 00:36:30.600]   What are we doing wrong?
[00:36:30.600 --> 00:36:35.620]   Because we've been carefully trying to obey all the commandments, so they come to Jesus
[00:36:35.620 --> 00:36:36.620]   like, "What more?
[00:36:36.620 --> 00:36:37.620]   What do we lack?
[00:36:37.620 --> 00:36:38.620]   What is the greatest commandment?"
[00:36:38.620 --> 00:36:44.440]   Jesus says, "Love the Lord your God with all your heart, soul, mind, and strength,
[00:36:44.440 --> 00:36:45.660]   and everything else."
[00:36:45.660 --> 00:36:47.240]   The second is just like it.
[00:36:47.240 --> 00:36:52.640]   In other words, He only gave them one answer, and that one answer is love the Lord.
[00:36:52.640 --> 00:36:55.140]   To be jealous for Him.
[00:36:55.140 --> 00:37:01.780]   Again in Hosea chapter 6, "For I desire steadfast love and not sacrifice."
[00:37:01.780 --> 00:37:05.580]   The knowledge of God rather than burnt offering.
[00:37:05.580 --> 00:37:07.300]   Who commanded the sacrifices?
[00:37:07.300 --> 00:37:08.800]   God did.
[00:37:08.800 --> 00:37:10.460]   Who commanded the burnt offerings?
[00:37:10.460 --> 00:37:11.800]   God did.
[00:37:11.800 --> 00:37:13.460]   But Israel completely missed the point.
[00:37:13.460 --> 00:37:16.840]   They just thought that if they did the right thing that God would be pleased.
[00:37:16.840 --> 00:37:24.400]   But over and over again, God calls out their superficial fake worship, their lip service,
[00:37:24.400 --> 00:37:31.800]   singing of songs that they don't really care about, serving without a devotion of
[00:37:31.800 --> 00:37:34.560]   worship.
[00:37:34.560 --> 00:37:42.900]   Anything that we do to appease other people, to simply a check off list, eventually will
[00:37:42.900 --> 00:37:45.480]   burn us.
[00:37:45.480 --> 00:37:54.760]   I've been a pastorate long enough to know and see and experience that people who are
[00:37:54.760 --> 00:38:00.280]   the most dedicated at one point in the church are the ones who end up hating the church
[00:38:00.280 --> 00:38:04.020]   most in the later part.
[00:38:04.020 --> 00:38:08.080]   And I'm not saying, "So therefore don't serve the church."
[00:38:08.080 --> 00:38:09.080]   That's my point.
[00:38:09.080 --> 00:38:10.800]   "Don't serve the church."
[00:38:10.800 --> 00:38:11.800]   Stop it.
[00:38:11.800 --> 00:38:12.800]   That's not my point.
[00:38:12.800 --> 00:38:15.880]   Obviously that's not my point.
[00:38:15.880 --> 00:38:22.440]   But I've seen so much devotion to the things of God that is not motivated for the love
[00:38:22.440 --> 00:38:29.160]   for God that eventually turns into bitterness toward God.
[00:38:29.160 --> 00:38:33.760]   It starts out with, "I'm going to serve the church," and then you get disappointed
[00:38:33.760 --> 00:38:34.880]   and then you become neutral.
[00:38:34.880 --> 00:38:37.000]   I tolerate the church.
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:40.120]   And then when things don't get resolved, the tolerance of the church becomes hatred
[00:38:40.120 --> 00:38:42.320]   toward the church.
[00:38:42.320 --> 00:38:44.280]   That's exactly what it says in Psalm chapter one.
[00:38:44.280 --> 00:38:48.280]   "Blessed is the man who does not walk in the counsel of the wicked or stand in the
[00:38:48.280 --> 00:38:51.280]   way of sinners or sit in the seat of mockers."
[00:38:51.280 --> 00:38:54.640]   You see the progression of their sin?
[00:38:54.640 --> 00:38:59.000]   Walk in a council, stand with sinners, and then sit with mockers.
[00:38:59.000 --> 00:39:02.960]   It's the same sinner.
[00:39:02.960 --> 00:39:09.360]   When we give ourselves simply to appease and we are not compelled by the love of Christ,
[00:39:09.360 --> 00:39:10.360]   church becomes ugly.
[00:39:10.360 --> 00:39:11.840]   Our Christian life becomes a burden.
[00:39:11.840 --> 00:39:17.880]   We cannot bear, as Paul described in the previous passage.
[00:39:17.880 --> 00:39:26.760]   His provoking of the nation of Israel reveals to us exactly what God desires of His people.
[00:39:26.760 --> 00:39:30.480]   He doesn't simply want us to do the right thing.
[00:39:30.480 --> 00:39:36.000]   He doesn't simply want us to change our behavior from one behavior to another.
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:37.040]   Don't get me wrong.
[00:39:37.040 --> 00:39:38.540]   God wants holiness.
[00:39:38.540 --> 00:39:40.840]   He demands holiness.
[00:39:40.840 --> 00:39:46.520]   But He wants holiness to be inspired and compelled by the love of Christ.
[00:39:46.520 --> 00:39:53.400]   So you can come to church and serve, give, lead, go to missions, do all of that thing,
[00:39:53.400 --> 00:39:59.640]   make all the sacrifices, and completely miss the point.
[00:39:59.640 --> 00:40:08.180]   Because what God desires more than anything else is for us to be just as jealous for Him.
[00:40:08.180 --> 00:40:14.280]   To covet His love more than His gift.
[00:40:14.280 --> 00:40:16.440]   To covet Him.
[00:40:16.440 --> 00:40:20.240]   That our salvation isn't just deliverance from hell.
[00:40:20.240 --> 00:40:22.680]   That's a ramification of our salvation.
[00:40:22.680 --> 00:40:28.120]   But the real gift of salvation is Christ.
[00:40:28.120 --> 00:40:29.960]   Not what Christ can do.
[00:40:29.960 --> 00:40:32.000]   Not the prayers that He can answer.
[00:40:32.000 --> 00:40:36.560]   The real gift of salvation is that the barrier between us and God was taken away now that
[00:40:36.560 --> 00:40:40.920]   I can have this relationship with Him.
[00:40:40.920 --> 00:40:45.160]   The author of life I can call my Abba Father.
[00:40:45.160 --> 00:40:51.040]   So all the blessings come as a result of knowing Him.
[00:40:51.040 --> 00:40:53.560]   But the point is to know Him.
[00:40:53.560 --> 00:40:58.200]   The point is to love Him, to worship Him.
[00:40:58.200 --> 00:40:59.520]   I want to end with a video.
[00:40:59.520 --> 00:41:00.520]   This video is pretty long.
[00:41:00.520 --> 00:41:02.320]   It's a 10-minute video.
[00:41:02.320 --> 00:41:06.120]   And some of you guys may have seen it before because I think I put it up years ago.
[00:41:06.120 --> 00:41:09.000]   But I think it makes the point that I want to make.
[00:41:09.000 --> 00:41:11.120]   That God's love for the nation of Israel.
[00:41:11.120 --> 00:41:12.120]   And I want to read this verse.
[00:41:12.120 --> 00:41:15.440]   And then after we watch this video, I'm going to ask the praise team to just come up and
[00:41:15.440 --> 00:41:17.600]   lead us in a time of worship.
[00:41:17.600 --> 00:41:24.320]   In verse 12 it says, "Now, if their," meaning the nation of Israel, "if their trespass means
[00:41:24.320 --> 00:41:29.920]   riches for the world, and if their failure means riches for the Gentiles, how much more
[00:41:29.920 --> 00:41:32.400]   will their full inclusion mean?"
[00:41:32.400 --> 00:41:38.520]   In other words, when God finally brings the Gentiles into His fold and then He provokes
[00:41:38.520 --> 00:41:42.880]   them to jealousy and they begin to come to Christ, the nation of Israel begins to get
[00:41:42.880 --> 00:41:48.880]   reestablished, how much more the blessing, how much more the rejoicing?
[00:41:48.880 --> 00:41:51.800]   Let's take a few minutes to watch this video and then we'll ask the praise team to come
[00:41:51.800 --> 00:41:52.800]   up and lead us.
[00:41:52.800 --> 00:41:55.160]   Thanks for listening.
