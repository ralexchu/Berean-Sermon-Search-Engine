[00:08:41.000 --> 00:08:48.000]   >> Good evening, church family.
[00:08:48.000 --> 00:08:51.000]   Why don't we rise together, and then I'm gonna go ahead and pray for us, and
[00:08:51.000 --> 00:08:54.000]   then we're gonna sing a few songs together.
[00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.000]   Let's pray.
[00:08:57.000 --> 00:09:01.000]   God, you are great and worthy of honor.
[00:09:01.000 --> 00:09:07.000]   Lord, we come before you with a desire to see your name magnified.
[00:09:07.000 --> 00:09:12.000]   I pray, Lord God, that you ready our hearts, that you give us humbleness of
[00:09:12.000 --> 00:09:16.000]   heart as we approach a God who is holy, holy, holy.
[00:09:16.000 --> 00:09:20.000]   And yet, Lord God, you are gracious and merciful to us,
[00:09:20.000 --> 00:09:23.000]   that you restore the relationship with you.
[00:09:23.000 --> 00:09:27.000]   Through the blood of Christ, that we are able to come and
[00:09:27.000 --> 00:09:30.000]   approach your throne with confidence.
[00:09:30.000 --> 00:09:34.000]   Father, I pray, Lord, that as the church is gathered to pray and
[00:09:34.000 --> 00:09:39.000]   to sing these songs of worship, may it be a sweet sound unto your ear.
[00:09:39.000 --> 00:09:42.000]   May your prayers be effective.
[00:09:42.000 --> 00:09:46.000]   Help us, Lord God, to put away any distractions in our minds and
[00:09:46.000 --> 00:09:48.000]   our schedules, Lord God, and
[00:09:48.000 --> 00:09:52.000]   really focus our attention to what we're doing here tonight.
[00:09:52.000 --> 00:09:57.000]   We ask, Lord God, that you give us brokenness and
[00:09:57.000 --> 00:10:02.000]   repentance, Lord God, that our hearts may be inclined towards you.
[00:10:02.000 --> 00:10:08.000]   So we ask, Lord God, for your spirit to remind us of many things that
[00:10:08.000 --> 00:10:12.000]   we're doing in our lives, Lord God, that need to be pruned.
[00:10:12.000 --> 00:10:16.000]   And, Lord God, that you give us the strength to be sanctified,
[00:10:16.000 --> 00:10:19.000]   to be living in a way, Lord God, that is pleasing for you.
[00:10:19.000 --> 00:10:22.000]   So we ask and entrust this time to you.
[00:10:22.000 --> 00:10:23.000]   It's in Christ's name we pray.
[00:10:23.000 --> 00:10:24.000]   Amen.

[00:19:42.000 --> 00:19:48.000]   Can you turn the light on just a little bit?
[00:19:48.000 --> 00:19:52.000]   So I can see?
[00:19:52.000 --> 00:19:53.000]   Okay, that's good.
[00:19:53.000 --> 00:19:54.000]   All right.
[00:19:55.000 --> 00:19:58.000]   Verses 35 through 38.
[00:19:58.000 --> 00:20:06.000]   It says, Jesus was going through all the cities and villages,
[00:20:06.000 --> 00:20:09.000]   teaching in their synagogues, and proclaiming the gospel of the kingdom,
[00:20:09.000 --> 00:20:12.000]   and healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[00:20:12.000 --> 00:20:15.000]   Seeing the people, he felt compassion for them,
[00:20:15.000 --> 00:20:19.000]   because they were distressed and dispirited, like sheep without a shepherd.
[00:20:19.000 --> 00:20:23.000]   Then he said to his disciples, the harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:20:23.000 --> 00:20:27.000]   Therefore, beseech the Lord of the harvest to send out workers into his harvest.
[00:20:27.000 --> 00:20:28.000]   Let's pray.
[00:20:28.000 --> 00:20:34.000]   Father, we pray that you would give us understanding.
[00:20:34.000 --> 00:20:39.000]   Help us, Lord God, to be convicted that your word would prepare us
[00:20:39.000 --> 00:20:44.000]   to spend time in prayer together.
[00:20:44.000 --> 00:20:47.000]   That we may seek you, that our prayers, Lord God,
[00:20:47.000 --> 00:20:51.000]   would be sincere in the overflow of your spirit's guiding.
[00:20:51.000 --> 00:20:54.000]   Lord, as you reminded us and encouraged us,
[00:20:54.000 --> 00:21:00.000]   that your Holy Spirit groans within us with words that we cannot understand,
[00:21:00.000 --> 00:21:05.000]   that may intercede on our behalf, Lord God, for the very things that you desire.
[00:21:05.000 --> 00:21:08.000]   So help us this evening to know your word,
[00:21:08.000 --> 00:21:13.000]   and that your word would ignite in us a passion for you and for the lost.
[00:21:13.000 --> 00:21:15.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:21:18.000 --> 00:21:24.000]   Tonight, I wanted to take some time to pray for the lost in our lives,
[00:21:24.000 --> 00:21:27.000]   for our generation, for the spreading of the gospel.
[00:21:27.000 --> 00:21:31.000]   You know, every time I am outside of our church,
[00:21:31.000 --> 00:21:36.000]   you see the harvest, and everywhere I go,
[00:21:36.000 --> 00:21:39.000]   people are literally begging for help.
[00:21:39.000 --> 00:21:43.000]   Whether it is in another country or in other churches,
[00:21:43.000 --> 00:21:48.000]   and they're desperate, there are tremendous need,
[00:21:48.000 --> 00:21:51.000]   and they want help, whether that is financial,
[00:21:51.000 --> 00:21:57.000]   whether that is just more young people to come alongside and help with their work.
[00:21:57.000 --> 00:22:00.000]   And sometimes as our church grows,
[00:22:00.000 --> 00:22:03.000]   we can become insulated because there's so much need
[00:22:03.000 --> 00:22:06.000]   and things that we need inside the church,
[00:22:06.000 --> 00:22:10.000]   that after a while, we no longer have a spirit of evangelism.
[00:22:10.000 --> 00:22:13.000]   And you say, "Well, why are we evangelizing,
[00:22:13.000 --> 00:22:16.000]   and be so worried about what's going on outside the church,
[00:22:16.000 --> 00:22:19.000]   when there's so much going on inside the church?"
[00:22:19.000 --> 00:22:24.000]   But, so much of the problems that are created inside the church
[00:22:24.000 --> 00:22:28.000]   is because we're not paying attention to what's going on outside the church.
[00:22:28.000 --> 00:22:32.000]   So much of fellowship, lack of prayer, lack of urgency,
[00:22:32.000 --> 00:22:34.000]   the importance of the word of God,
[00:22:34.000 --> 00:22:40.000]   all of these things are directly connected to God's great commission.
[00:22:40.000 --> 00:22:43.000]   So when we're not directly connected to the great commission,
[00:22:43.000 --> 00:22:46.000]   and I'm not just talking about the leadership, I'm talking about the church,
[00:22:46.000 --> 00:22:49.000]   when you're not directly connected to the great commission,
[00:22:49.000 --> 00:22:51.000]   there's no urgency in prayer.
[00:22:51.000 --> 00:22:54.000]   Word of God is just studying, adding knowledge.
[00:22:54.000 --> 00:22:56.000]   Fellowship just becomes stimulation,
[00:22:56.000 --> 00:22:58.000]   just having somebody to talk to about God,
[00:22:58.000 --> 00:23:01.000]   or finding encouragement with one another.
[00:23:01.000 --> 00:23:04.000]   Everything that we do in the church is directly linked to
[00:23:04.000 --> 00:23:08.000]   the calling that God has given us in the church.
[00:23:08.000 --> 00:23:10.000]   The text that we're looking at tells us
[00:23:10.000 --> 00:23:13.000]   that almost everything that Jesus did,
[00:23:13.000 --> 00:23:16.000]   he did because of compassion.
[00:23:16.000 --> 00:23:19.000]   He saw the multitude, and he said he was moved with compassion.
[00:23:19.000 --> 00:23:23.000]   The word "compassion" literally means to have your bowels move.
[00:23:23.000 --> 00:23:25.000]   You know, in our culture, when we say "bowel move,"
[00:23:25.000 --> 00:23:27.000]   I mean, we mean something different, right?
[00:23:27.000 --> 00:23:29.000]   But basically, it's the heart of emotion.
[00:23:29.000 --> 00:23:32.000]   That's what, you know, at that period of time,
[00:23:32.000 --> 00:23:34.000]   what the Greeks and the Jews meant
[00:23:34.000 --> 00:23:36.000]   when they said that their bowels,
[00:23:36.000 --> 00:23:39.000]   their inner core of who they are, was moved.
[00:23:39.000 --> 00:23:41.000]   It wasn't just a light feeling.
[00:23:41.000 --> 00:23:45.000]   There's a compelling that happened, a yearning.
[00:23:45.000 --> 00:23:49.000]   Everything that we see in Matthew 20, 33, 34,
[00:23:49.000 --> 00:23:52.000]   we see that what moved Jesus was his compassion.
[00:23:52.000 --> 00:23:55.000]   They said to him, "Lord, we want our eyes to be open."
[00:23:55.000 --> 00:23:58.000]   He said, "Moved with compassion."
[00:23:58.000 --> 00:24:00.000]   Jesus touched their eyes, and immediately,
[00:24:00.000 --> 00:24:04.000]   they regained their sight and followed him.
[00:24:04.000 --> 00:24:07.000]   Matthew 1, 40, 41, "A leper came to Jesus,
[00:24:07.000 --> 00:24:10.000]   "beseeching him and falling on his knees before him and saying,
[00:24:10.000 --> 00:24:13.000]   "'If you are willing, you can make me clean.'
[00:24:13.000 --> 00:24:16.000]   "Moved with compassion, Jesus stretched out his hand
[00:24:16.000 --> 00:24:20.000]   "and touched him and said to him, 'I am willing to be cleansed.'"
[00:24:20.000 --> 00:24:24.000]   Luke 10, 33, 34, "But a Samaritan who was on a journey came upon him,
[00:24:24.000 --> 00:24:26.000]   "and when he saw him, he felt compassion."
[00:24:26.000 --> 00:24:28.000]   This is Jesus saying this is the reason behind
[00:24:28.000 --> 00:24:31.000]   why the Samaritan decided to get involved.
[00:24:31.000 --> 00:24:33.000]   "And came to him and bandaged up his wounds,
[00:24:33.000 --> 00:24:38.000]   "pouring oil and wine on them, and he put him on his beast
[00:24:38.000 --> 00:24:42.000]   "and brought him to an inn and took care of him."
[00:24:42.000 --> 00:24:46.000]   Luke 15, verse 20, the parable of the prodigal son.
[00:24:46.000 --> 00:24:48.000]   It says, "So he got up and came to his father,
[00:24:48.000 --> 00:24:50.000]   "but while he was still a long way off,
[00:24:50.000 --> 00:24:54.000]   "his father saw him and felt compassion for him
[00:24:54.000 --> 00:24:58.000]   "and ran and embraced him and kissed him."
[00:24:58.000 --> 00:25:02.000]   Typically, we don't move.
[00:25:02.000 --> 00:25:04.000]   I can give you knowledge and I can convince you
[00:25:04.000 --> 00:25:06.000]   what is truth and what is right,
[00:25:06.000 --> 00:25:10.000]   but typically, most people don't lead into action
[00:25:10.000 --> 00:25:13.000]   until you are moved with compassion, right?
[00:25:13.000 --> 00:25:17.000]   It's much easier to raise money for orphans
[00:25:17.000 --> 00:25:19.000]   because we can show you pictures of orphans
[00:25:19.000 --> 00:25:21.000]   and how they are desperate and they are in need,
[00:25:21.000 --> 00:25:24.000]   and it's not hard to move people toward compassion.
[00:25:24.000 --> 00:25:27.000]   And so because we look at them helpless
[00:25:27.000 --> 00:25:32.000]   and because they are in need of someone to help them,
[00:25:32.000 --> 00:25:33.000]   it's not that hard.
[00:25:33.000 --> 00:25:37.000]   Even non-Christians will donate for the cause of orphans.
[00:25:37.000 --> 00:25:39.000]   The Bible tells us that everything God did,
[00:25:39.000 --> 00:25:41.000]   he did with compassion.
[00:25:41.000 --> 00:25:45.000]   He looked at us, and instead of being disgusted by our sins,
[00:25:45.000 --> 00:25:48.000]   he felt compassion for us.
[00:25:48.000 --> 00:25:49.000]   In fact, that's the main reason.
[00:25:49.000 --> 00:25:52.000]   Like if you study the book of Hosea,
[00:25:52.000 --> 00:25:55.000]   it's an indictment against a nation of Israel.
[00:25:55.000 --> 00:25:57.000]   "You are not my people," right?
[00:25:57.000 --> 00:26:00.000]   Like, "I will not hear you."
[00:26:00.000 --> 00:26:02.000]   And yet, in Hosea 11:8,
[00:26:02.000 --> 00:26:04.000]   after he gives all this indictment
[00:26:04.000 --> 00:26:06.000]   against a nation of Israel, he says,
[00:26:06.000 --> 00:26:08.000]   "How can I give you up, O Ephraim?
[00:26:08.000 --> 00:26:10.000]   "How can I surrender you, O Israel?
[00:26:10.000 --> 00:26:12.000]   "How can I make you like Adonai?
[00:26:12.000 --> 00:26:14.000]   "How can I treat you like Zeboam?
[00:26:14.000 --> 00:26:17.000]   "My heart is turned over within me.
[00:26:17.000 --> 00:26:21.000]   "All my compassion are kindled."
[00:26:21.000 --> 00:26:23.000]   See, the reason why Israel was never destroyed,
[00:26:23.000 --> 00:26:25.000]   even though God warned them and God punished them,
[00:26:25.000 --> 00:26:30.000]   it says his compassion was kindled.
[00:26:30.000 --> 00:26:34.000]   Compassion is what caused God to send his only begotten son.
[00:26:34.000 --> 00:26:39.000]   Compassion was the reason why Jesus wept at Lazarus' tomb.
[00:26:39.000 --> 00:26:41.000]   Compassion was the reason why Jesus wept
[00:26:41.000 --> 00:26:45.000]   while he was riding into Jerusalem.
[00:26:45.000 --> 00:26:50.000]   Compassion is what moves us to be patient
[00:26:50.000 --> 00:26:52.000]   when somebody wrongs us.
[00:26:52.000 --> 00:26:54.000]   If we have hatred toward them,
[00:26:54.000 --> 00:26:59.000]   it's very difficult to move with compassion
[00:26:59.000 --> 00:27:01.000]   or to show grace.
[00:27:01.000 --> 00:27:04.000]   Patience and grace usually is followed
[00:27:04.000 --> 00:27:07.000]   because we look at them, and even if they wronged us,
[00:27:07.000 --> 00:27:10.000]   we have compassion on them.
[00:27:10.000 --> 00:27:12.000]   So compassion overwhelms us, and compassion moves us
[00:27:12.000 --> 00:27:19.000]   to obey and to practice what God practiced with us.
[00:27:19.000 --> 00:27:24.000]   But why do we oftentimes have it very difficult
[00:27:24.000 --> 00:27:27.000]   for us to understand?
[00:27:27.000 --> 00:27:29.000]   We know it mentally, but emotionally,
[00:27:29.000 --> 00:27:34.000]   why is it hard for us to relate to that?
[00:27:34.000 --> 00:27:39.000]   Let me read you a passage in Matthew 13, 49-50.
[00:27:39.000 --> 00:27:43.000]   "So it will be at the close of the age the angels will come out
[00:27:43.000 --> 00:27:45.000]   and separate the evil from the righteous
[00:27:45.000 --> 00:27:47.000]   and throw them into the fiery furnace.
[00:27:47.000 --> 00:27:53.000]   In that place there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth."
[00:27:53.000 --> 00:27:57.000]   If I asked you in this room how many of you believe
[00:27:57.000 --> 00:28:00.000]   in heaven and hell, I think most of you
[00:28:00.000 --> 00:28:02.000]   will at least raise your hand, doctrine only,
[00:28:02.000 --> 00:28:05.000]   because you believe that this Bible is God's Word,
[00:28:05.000 --> 00:28:07.000]   and you know that that's a doctrine that's been passed down
[00:28:07.000 --> 00:28:09.000]   to us from the first century.
[00:28:09.000 --> 00:28:11.000]   That we believe, if you believe in heaven,
[00:28:11.000 --> 00:28:13.000]   if you believe in God, if you believe in the gospel,
[00:28:13.000 --> 00:28:16.000]   as much as there is reward, there is judgment coming.
[00:28:16.000 --> 00:28:19.000]   And he says, "It will be a fiery furnace where there will be
[00:28:19.000 --> 00:28:28.000]   weeping and gnashing of teeth, and there is no end to this."
[00:28:28.000 --> 00:28:32.000]   Why does that not move us to compassion?
[00:28:32.000 --> 00:28:37.000]   Why do we read that passage like a stale doctrinal statement?
[00:28:37.000 --> 00:28:44.000]   If you see somebody hurt, if I told you that a dog got ran over,
[00:28:44.000 --> 00:28:49.000]   a cute little dog got ran over outside, you say, "Oh my gosh."
[00:28:49.000 --> 00:28:54.000]   If we see other things, tragedies, earthquakes,
[00:28:54.000 --> 00:28:59.000]   you move with compassion, yet the greatest tragedy
[00:28:59.000 --> 00:29:02.000]   that you and I could possibly imagine,
[00:29:02.000 --> 00:29:05.000]   that we are surrounded by people,
[00:29:05.000 --> 00:29:09.000]   if they do not repent before they die,
[00:29:09.000 --> 00:29:13.000]   the Bible says that they will meet a holy, holy, holy God,
[00:29:13.000 --> 00:29:15.000]   and judgment is waiting upon them,
[00:29:15.000 --> 00:29:23.000]   where there will be weeping and gnashing of teeth with no end.
[00:29:23.000 --> 00:29:30.000]   And yet, we live day to day proclaiming that we believe that
[00:29:30.000 --> 00:29:32.000]   and professing that we believe that,
[00:29:32.000 --> 00:29:35.000]   checking off the mark as a doctrinal statement,
[00:29:35.000 --> 00:29:39.000]   yet it doesn't move us to evangelize.
[00:29:39.000 --> 00:29:47.000]   When was the last time you prayed for the lost, weeping for them?
[00:29:47.000 --> 00:29:54.000]   Why has our heart hardened, or why has it become normal
[00:29:54.000 --> 00:29:59.000]   to profess this with no movement?
[00:29:59.000 --> 00:30:06.000]   I remember meeting an oncologist who told me that regularly
[00:30:06.000 --> 00:30:09.000]   his job is to tell people that they have two months to live,
[00:30:09.000 --> 00:30:12.000]   one month to live, three months to live.
[00:30:12.000 --> 00:30:15.000]   And I remember asking him, "How do you handle that?"
[00:30:15.000 --> 00:30:18.000]   And he said, "Eventually, we become numb."
[00:30:18.000 --> 00:30:21.000]   He said, "There have been situations where one of their colleagues
[00:30:21.000 --> 00:30:25.000]   would tell somebody that your father only has a day or two days to live.
[00:30:25.000 --> 00:30:28.000]   I mean, he's at the end, and you guys need to prepare."
[00:30:28.000 --> 00:30:31.000]   And then as soon as he exits the room,
[00:30:31.000 --> 00:30:34.000]   they're telling jokes to one another.
[00:30:34.000 --> 00:30:37.000]   And he says that they become so callous,
[00:30:37.000 --> 00:30:39.000]   that he said, "It no longer thinks that."
[00:30:39.000 --> 00:30:41.000]   It's shocking to hear that,
[00:30:41.000 --> 00:30:43.000]   and I know how shocking that may sound to you,
[00:30:43.000 --> 00:30:46.000]   but he said that that's the only way that they're able to do their job,
[00:30:46.000 --> 00:30:49.000]   if they somehow cut it off.
[00:30:49.000 --> 00:30:54.000]   There are police officers who become so numb to violence,
[00:30:54.000 --> 00:30:57.000]   they can see somebody jumping off of a building
[00:30:57.000 --> 00:31:02.000]   or shot or head decapitated from an accident and joke about it.
[00:31:02.000 --> 00:31:05.000]   And it's shocking to the rest of us,
[00:31:05.000 --> 00:31:08.000]   but they see it so often, they harden their hearts,
[00:31:08.000 --> 00:31:10.000]   and it doesn't bother them
[00:31:10.000 --> 00:31:12.000]   until you take a step back,
[00:31:12.000 --> 00:31:15.000]   and somebody who's not in that situation looks at them and says,
[00:31:15.000 --> 00:31:18.000]   "How could you be so callous?"
[00:31:18.000 --> 00:31:24.000]   The scholars believe they have a name for that.
[00:31:24.000 --> 00:31:27.000]   They call it hedonic adaptation.
[00:31:27.000 --> 00:31:31.000]   It says mental habit done over and over,
[00:31:31.000 --> 00:31:34.000]   when it is stimulated over the same thing,
[00:31:34.000 --> 00:31:37.000]   eventually becomes mundane.
[00:31:37.000 --> 00:31:39.000]   And once it becomes mundane,
[00:31:39.000 --> 00:31:45.000]   we become insensitive to hearing, seeing, feeling, tasting what is around us.
[00:31:45.000 --> 00:31:49.000]   We become so accustomed to talking about judgment,
[00:31:49.000 --> 00:31:52.000]   and we've heard it so many times,
[00:31:52.000 --> 00:31:55.000]   that that statement no longer shocks us,
[00:31:55.000 --> 00:31:57.000]   no longer moves us.
[00:31:57.000 --> 00:31:59.000]   It's just part of our doctrinal statement.
[00:31:59.000 --> 00:32:01.000]   We want to talk about good things of God,
[00:32:01.000 --> 00:32:04.000]   and the Bible is yet filled with warnings
[00:32:04.000 --> 00:32:06.000]   of if they do not repent.
[00:32:06.000 --> 00:32:08.000]   And the whole reason why Christ has not come yet
[00:32:08.000 --> 00:32:11.000]   is because he is patiently waiting for the church
[00:32:11.000 --> 00:32:14.000]   to bring the gospel to this lost world.
[00:32:14.000 --> 00:32:18.000]   The problem is not that we don't have money.
[00:32:18.000 --> 00:32:21.000]   The problem is not that we're lacking training.
[00:32:21.000 --> 00:32:25.000]   The problem is not that there's lack of schools.
[00:32:25.000 --> 00:32:29.000]   The problem is we don't have the will.
[00:32:29.000 --> 00:32:32.000]   And we don't have the will because we are not moved.
[00:32:34.000 --> 00:32:38.000]   Sometimes this is called hedonic treadmill.
[00:32:38.000 --> 00:32:40.000]   Like if you go to the gym and you exercise,
[00:32:40.000 --> 00:32:42.000]   and anybody who's lifted weights,
[00:32:42.000 --> 00:32:45.000]   you know that if you lift weights in the same way over and over again,
[00:32:45.000 --> 00:32:47.000]   after a few weeks, a few months,
[00:32:47.000 --> 00:32:51.000]   it no longer has the effect because your muscles have adapted to that.
[00:32:51.000 --> 00:32:55.000]   And so you need to do something else to shock the muscle.
[00:32:55.000 --> 00:33:00.000]   You're no longer growing because your muscles have adapted.
[00:33:00.000 --> 00:33:06.000]   Our spiritual muscles have adapted to this shocking truth
[00:33:06.000 --> 00:33:11.000]   that maybe at one point in our lives, it moved us.
[00:33:11.000 --> 00:33:14.000]   Maybe at one point in our lives, there was a desperateness
[00:33:14.000 --> 00:33:17.000]   and sense of urgency when we prayed, and we need to evangelize.
[00:33:17.000 --> 00:33:20.000]   We need to tell people about this truth.
[00:33:20.000 --> 00:33:26.000]   But for whatever the reason, we have become accustomed,
[00:33:26.000 --> 00:33:31.000]   accustomed to hearing that the whole world,
[00:33:31.000 --> 00:33:36.000]   it will be judged under his fiery judgment.
[00:33:36.000 --> 00:33:41.000]   And we are more concerned about what we're going to be doing in our holidays.
[00:33:41.000 --> 00:33:50.000]   We're more concerned about if I'm going to be able to make the right investments,
[00:33:50.000 --> 00:33:55.000]   if I'm going to marry the right person, if I'm going to buy the right house.
[00:33:55.000 --> 00:33:59.000]   None of these things are sinful in and of itself.
[00:33:59.000 --> 00:34:04.000]   But when that becomes the primary thing that we're concerned about,
[00:34:04.000 --> 00:34:07.000]   imagine from God's perspective.
[00:34:07.000 --> 00:34:12.000]   He's waiting for the church to wake up to plead according to his will,
[00:34:12.000 --> 00:34:18.000]   according to his word, and then to hear over and over and over and over again
[00:34:18.000 --> 00:34:22.000]   the same prayer, "Keep me healthy. Keep me safe.
[00:34:22.000 --> 00:34:25.000]   Make sure that I'm making the right decision.
[00:34:25.000 --> 00:34:28.000]   Make sure that things that I want and I desire that I can have."
[00:34:28.000 --> 00:34:31.000]   Imagine from God's perspective, he sent his only begotten son,
[00:34:31.000 --> 00:34:35.000]   and he said, "Go, make disciples of all the nations."
[00:34:35.000 --> 00:34:40.000]   And instead of going, we said, "Well, not everybody needs to go.
[00:34:40.000 --> 00:34:43.000]   Not everybody. God didn't call everybody to evangelize.
[00:34:43.000 --> 00:34:47.000]   That's not my gift."
[00:34:47.000 --> 00:34:54.000]   Lukewarm basically means to adapt to the temperature of the room.
[00:34:54.000 --> 00:34:56.000]   That's what lukewarm is.
[00:34:56.000 --> 00:35:00.000]   And so the harshest rebuke goes to the Laodicean church
[00:35:00.000 --> 00:35:01.000]   because of their lukewarmness.
[00:35:01.000 --> 00:35:03.000]   They're neither hot nor cold.
[00:35:03.000 --> 00:35:06.000]   Now, lukewarmness doesn't happen because you choose one or the other.
[00:35:06.000 --> 00:35:10.000]   Lukewarmness basically is adapting to the culture that you belong to,
[00:35:10.000 --> 00:35:14.000]   adapting to the entertainment, adapting to its values,
[00:35:14.000 --> 00:35:20.000]   adapting to the music, adapting to the movies that you watch.
[00:35:20.000 --> 00:35:25.000]   And you become more and more like the culture and the generation that we live in,
[00:35:25.000 --> 00:35:27.000]   and you become lukewarm.
[00:35:27.000 --> 00:35:29.000]   So the things that make them sad makes us sad.
[00:35:29.000 --> 00:35:32.000]   Things that make them happy makes us happy.
[00:35:32.000 --> 00:35:34.000]   That's what lukewarmness is.
[00:35:34.000 --> 00:35:39.000]   We've just become just like the culture around us.
[00:35:39.000 --> 00:35:43.000]   Matthew 24:12 says, "Because of lawlessness will be increased,
[00:35:43.000 --> 00:35:46.000]   the love of many will grow cold."
[00:35:46.000 --> 00:35:50.000]   Why would lawlessness cause many people's love to grow cold?
[00:35:50.000 --> 00:35:53.000]   Because they're adjusting.
[00:35:53.000 --> 00:35:57.000]   The increase of wickedness is no longer shocking.
[00:35:57.000 --> 00:36:00.000]   It no longer compels us.
[00:36:00.000 --> 00:36:02.000]   And so we adapt.
[00:36:02.000 --> 00:36:06.000]   It's just the way it is.
[00:36:06.000 --> 00:36:09.000]   We need to take a step back and ask ourselves,
[00:36:09.000 --> 00:36:14.000]   why does this truth not compel us?
[00:36:14.000 --> 00:36:20.000]   Why do we look at the loss and not feel any compassion?
[00:36:20.000 --> 00:36:25.000]   Why am I able to live my life like anybody else in this world,
[00:36:25.000 --> 00:36:28.000]   coming to church week after week after week after week,
[00:36:28.000 --> 00:36:37.000]   professing that we believe this and yet entangled with civilian affairs?
[00:36:37.000 --> 00:36:43.000]   When was the last time you pleaded on God's behalf for the lost?
[00:36:43.000 --> 00:36:47.000]   When was the last time that you made an effort to share the gospel
[00:36:47.000 --> 00:36:49.000]   with somebody that did not know?
[00:36:49.000 --> 00:36:52.000]   Not just applauding what other people are doing.
[00:36:52.000 --> 00:36:57.000]   Not just reading books and being encouraged by what other people are doing.
[00:36:57.000 --> 00:37:01.000]   When was the last time that you were moved with compassion?
[00:37:01.000 --> 00:37:03.000]   The text that we're looking at,
[00:37:03.000 --> 00:37:06.000]   I want to highlight three things from this text because, one,
[00:37:06.000 --> 00:37:12.000]   compassion comes from engagement with the lost.
[00:37:12.000 --> 00:37:15.000]   It tells us that Jesus went from city to city.
[00:37:15.000 --> 00:37:18.000]   He didn't just come and sit on the throne and then give a sermon
[00:37:18.000 --> 00:37:20.000]   and then say, "Everybody come if you want to listen to me."
[00:37:20.000 --> 00:37:22.000]   Jesus went after them.
[00:37:22.000 --> 00:37:28.000]   He left his throne and he went from city to city.
[00:37:28.000 --> 00:37:31.000]   He went from city to city.
[00:37:31.000 --> 00:37:34.000]   And those of you who've been to India with us,
[00:37:34.000 --> 00:37:37.000]   you know the distance that from driving we need to go an hour and a half
[00:37:37.000 --> 00:37:41.000]   to two hours in a car to get to these villages.
[00:37:41.000 --> 00:37:45.000]   Pastor Matthew, who started this ministry, would walk into these villages.
[00:37:45.000 --> 00:37:47.000]   It would take days to get in.
[00:37:47.000 --> 00:37:52.000]   And if they reject him, they would have to walk out.
[00:37:52.000 --> 00:37:57.000]   The Bible tells us that Jesus and his disciples went city to city looking, seeking,
[00:37:57.000 --> 00:38:02.000]   so that they may find a synagogue, preach about the kingdom,
[00:38:02.000 --> 00:38:06.000]   healing every kind of disease and every kind of sickness.
[00:38:06.000 --> 00:38:10.000]   Now, he didn't heal them because somehow that was going to change their life drastically.
[00:38:10.000 --> 00:38:14.000]   He knew that they were going to die in their sins if they do not repent,
[00:38:14.000 --> 00:38:17.000]   but he served them because he was compassionate.
[00:38:17.000 --> 00:38:21.000]   He didn't say, "Well, you're going to die anyway."
[00:38:21.000 --> 00:38:26.000]   No, when he saw that they had need, he served them.
[00:38:26.000 --> 00:38:29.000]   Compassion doesn't come from a distance.
[00:38:29.000 --> 00:38:33.000]   If you live in a bubble where all you're concerned about is your friends
[00:38:33.000 --> 00:38:37.000]   and then you go back to your home, you enjoy the safety
[00:38:37.000 --> 00:38:41.000]   and your nicely air-conditioned situation,
[00:38:41.000 --> 00:38:49.000]   and your whole life is circled around the comfort of your home,
[00:38:49.000 --> 00:38:53.000]   you may feel compassion here and there,
[00:38:53.000 --> 00:38:55.000]   but you will not be moved with compassion.
[00:38:55.000 --> 00:38:58.000]   It's hard to love people from a distance.
[00:38:58.000 --> 00:39:01.000]   It's easy to judge people from a distance,
[00:39:01.000 --> 00:39:04.000]   but it's very difficult to love people from a distance
[00:39:04.000 --> 00:39:07.000]   because you don't know their heartache, you don't know their pain,
[00:39:07.000 --> 00:39:10.000]   you don't know their struggles, you don't know their needs.
[00:39:10.000 --> 00:39:14.000]   We have a tendency to create an environment where we feel safe and comfortable,
[00:39:14.000 --> 00:39:16.000]   and anybody who makes us feel uncomfortable,
[00:39:16.000 --> 00:39:18.000]   who don't talk like us, who don't have our values,
[00:39:18.000 --> 00:39:22.000]   we tend to keep them out of our homes.
[00:39:22.000 --> 00:39:27.000]   Jesus went from city to city to seek and save the lost.
[00:39:27.000 --> 00:39:31.000]   Compassion comes when you recognize their needs.
[00:39:31.000 --> 00:39:33.000]   You're not going to recognize that from a distance.
[00:39:33.000 --> 00:39:36.000]   It tells us that Jesus saw them,
[00:39:36.000 --> 00:39:39.000]   and he had compassion because they were distressed.
[00:39:39.000 --> 00:39:42.000]   Distressed basically means exhausted.
[00:39:42.000 --> 00:39:45.000]   They were about to faint.
[00:39:45.000 --> 00:39:47.000]   They were dispirited.
[00:39:47.000 --> 00:39:51.000]   It literally means to be cast down or defeated.
[00:39:51.000 --> 00:39:55.000]   And they were like sheep without shepherds, directionless, helpless.
[00:39:55.000 --> 00:39:59.000]   Sheep without a shepherd means that they're vulnerable to attacks,
[00:39:59.000 --> 00:40:02.000]   that wolves can come and any danger can come,
[00:40:02.000 --> 00:40:04.000]   and they're completely vulnerable.
[00:40:04.000 --> 00:40:06.000]   Jesus had compassion.
[00:40:06.000 --> 00:40:09.000]   He was compelled because when he saw them,
[00:40:09.000 --> 00:40:13.000]   he saw sinners who were exhausted, living in this sinful world,
[00:40:13.000 --> 00:40:17.000]   where death reigns.
[00:40:17.000 --> 00:40:22.000]   When's the last time you talked to a nonbeliever and you saw that?
[00:40:22.000 --> 00:40:24.000]   Yes, I know, we get exhausted.
[00:40:24.000 --> 00:40:26.000]   We get tired.
[00:40:26.000 --> 00:40:29.000]   Difficult situations come into our life,
[00:40:29.000 --> 00:40:33.000]   but we have hope in Christ.
[00:40:33.000 --> 00:40:40.000]   Even in your worst nightmare, you will be in heaven earlier.
[00:40:40.000 --> 00:40:42.000]   We're not talking about just being fatigued and tired.
[00:40:42.000 --> 00:40:45.000]   We're talking about people who have no hope.
[00:40:45.000 --> 00:40:49.000]   Jesus saw them, and because they were in their sins, they were exhausted.
[00:40:49.000 --> 00:40:52.000]   They were working with no end.
[00:40:52.000 --> 00:40:56.000]   When they get into trials, there is no hope.
[00:40:56.000 --> 00:40:58.000]   There's nowhere to turn to.
[00:40:58.000 --> 00:41:00.000]   They were defeated.
[00:41:00.000 --> 00:41:05.000]   Do you remember before you met Christ, some of you,
[00:41:05.000 --> 00:41:08.000]   what it was like when you had no hope?
[00:41:08.000 --> 00:41:10.000]   I do.
[00:41:10.000 --> 00:41:14.000]   I remember being bitter and angry,
[00:41:14.000 --> 00:41:20.000]   thinking that this life is not worth living because I had no exit.
[00:41:20.000 --> 00:41:22.000]   I couldn't see in front of me.
[00:41:22.000 --> 00:41:29.000]   I didn't want to live, but I can't end it.
[00:41:29.000 --> 00:41:34.000]   How many people do you think that are living around us who have no hope,
[00:41:34.000 --> 00:41:38.000]   and they go through trials, and they're defeated and beaten,
[00:41:38.000 --> 00:41:41.000]   and they are completely unprotected?
[00:41:41.000 --> 00:41:44.000]   They are sheep without shepherd.
[00:41:44.000 --> 00:41:47.000]   See, that's not something we can know from a distance.
[00:41:47.000 --> 00:41:52.000]   You can hear what I'm saying and hear it as a theory.
[00:41:52.000 --> 00:41:57.000]   But most likely, you probably know somebody in your life, most likely,
[00:41:57.000 --> 00:42:01.000]   whether it's a close family member or maybe your neighbor,
[00:42:01.000 --> 00:42:04.000]   maybe a co-worker, maybe somebody that you knew.
[00:42:04.000 --> 00:42:10.000]   You probably know somebody who doesn't know Christ.
[00:42:10.000 --> 00:42:12.000]   I want to take some time to pray for them.
[00:42:12.000 --> 00:42:18.000]   And then compassion is ultimately what brings us to God.
[00:42:18.000 --> 00:42:21.000]   Before we organize and we get to do this,
[00:42:21.000 --> 00:42:26.000]   when we are moved with compassion, we feel helpless.
[00:42:26.000 --> 00:42:30.000]   That the only answer is not, "Let's get organized.
[00:42:30.000 --> 00:42:32.000]   Let's get courageous.
[00:42:32.000 --> 00:42:34.000]   Let's do something."
[00:42:34.000 --> 00:42:41.000]   Because what they are in need of, you and I do not have the answer
[00:42:41.000 --> 00:42:43.000]   in and of ourselves.
[00:42:43.000 --> 00:42:47.000]   The only answer to their fatigue, them being defeated,
[00:42:47.000 --> 00:42:52.000]   and them being helpless without direction is the gospel of Jesus Christ.
[00:42:52.000 --> 00:43:00.000]   So when you are moved to compassion, it forces you to pray with urgency.
[00:43:00.000 --> 00:43:01.000]   You may not be sick.
[00:43:01.000 --> 00:43:04.000]   There may not be any emergency in you.
[00:43:04.000 --> 00:43:09.000]   But there will never be a time in your life while we are living here
[00:43:09.000 --> 00:43:14.000]   where we have no cause of urgency because we are surrounded by people
[00:43:14.000 --> 00:43:17.000]   who do not know Christ.
[00:43:17.000 --> 00:43:22.000]   Every single day that we live, we are living with people in our generation,
[00:43:22.000 --> 00:43:27.000]   all around us, and many even in our own homes who do not know Christ.
[00:43:27.000 --> 00:43:31.000]   So there is never a minute, as long as we live on this earth,
[00:43:31.000 --> 00:43:35.000]   where there is no sense of urgency.
[00:43:35.000 --> 00:43:41.000]   If there is no sense of urgency, something has gone wrong with us.
[00:43:41.000 --> 00:43:47.000]   He says to his disciples, "Harvest is plentiful."
[00:43:47.000 --> 00:43:51.000]   And as I told you, one of the common questions I get now,
[00:43:51.000 --> 00:43:55.000]   as I'm getting a little bit older, more and more of my peers are beginning
[00:43:55.000 --> 00:43:58.000]   to either plan for retirement or thinking of retirement.
[00:43:58.000 --> 00:44:03.000]   And one of the most common questions that I get is, "What are you planning?
[00:44:03.000 --> 00:44:06.000]   Are you going to retire when you're 60? Are you going to retire when you're 70?
[00:44:06.000 --> 00:44:10.000]   What are you planning?"
[00:44:10.000 --> 00:44:13.000]   I have no idea.
[00:44:13.000 --> 00:44:23.000]   But every time I go outside, I am compelled that the benefit
[00:44:23.000 --> 00:44:30.000]   of having a large church is that we have resources that we haven't had before.
[00:44:30.000 --> 00:44:34.000]   We have resources of people that we haven't had before.
[00:44:34.000 --> 00:44:38.000]   We can mobilize that we couldn't do before.
[00:44:38.000 --> 00:44:45.000]   And so what that means is we are more responsible today than we were five years ago.
[00:44:45.000 --> 00:44:50.000]   God has given more to steward today than 10 years ago,
[00:44:50.000 --> 00:44:57.000]   which means there's more work to engage in today than 10 years ago.
[00:44:57.000 --> 00:45:04.000]   The harvest is plentiful, but the workers are few.
[00:45:04.000 --> 00:45:07.000]   The harvest is plentiful. People are dying every single day.
[00:45:07.000 --> 00:45:14.000]   But when it says the workers are few, it means few are seeking the lost.
[00:45:14.000 --> 00:45:18.000]   Few are crying out for the lost.
[00:45:18.000 --> 00:45:23.000]   Few care for the lost.
[00:45:23.000 --> 00:45:31.000]   Few are committed in their lives to bring the gospel to the lost.
[00:45:31.000 --> 00:45:35.000]   So therefore, he says to beseech the Lord of the harvest.
[00:45:35.000 --> 00:45:39.000]   This isn't just let him know. He already knows.
[00:45:39.000 --> 00:45:43.000]   It's not just ask. He already knows.
[00:45:43.000 --> 00:45:46.000]   He's waiting for us.
[00:45:46.000 --> 00:45:49.000]   He's waiting for us to be desperate.
[00:45:49.000 --> 00:45:52.000]   He's waiting for us to make up our mind.
[00:45:52.000 --> 00:45:55.000]   He's waiting for us to be moved with compassion.
[00:45:55.000 --> 00:46:00.000]   He's waiting for us to weep for the lost as Christ wept for us.
[00:46:00.000 --> 00:46:02.000]   So when he says beseech the Lord of the harvest,
[00:46:02.000 --> 00:46:07.000]   he's not saying that because our God is indifferent to move him.
[00:46:07.000 --> 00:46:11.000]   That we need to shake him. That we need to somehow cause him to have compassion.
[00:46:11.000 --> 00:46:16.000]   He's waiting for us to make up our mind.
[00:46:16.000 --> 00:46:28.000]   What is it that you are entangled with that is more important than to bring the gospel to the lost?
[00:46:28.000 --> 00:46:32.000]   Nothing. Nothing.
[00:46:32.000 --> 00:46:37.000]   When we get to heaven, we're not going to regret the places that we haven't seen,
[00:46:37.000 --> 00:46:40.000]   the food that we haven't eaten.
[00:46:40.000 --> 00:46:43.000]   We're not going to regret any of that.
[00:46:43.000 --> 00:46:49.000]   If there is regret, and I'm not sure, but if there is regret,
[00:46:49.000 --> 00:46:54.000]   every single Christian will regret that we didn't spend every single minute of our life
[00:46:54.000 --> 00:47:03.000]   to bring the gospel to as many people as possible.
[00:47:03.000 --> 00:47:12.000]   I wanted to take some time to pray and beseech the Lord together.
[00:47:12.000 --> 00:47:21.000]   People ask me, how are you guys running a church with four pastors and four elders?
[00:47:21.000 --> 00:47:25.000]   And I could say, yeah, we have many people serving, which we do.
[00:47:25.000 --> 00:47:29.000]   A lot of people who are engaged in our church, which we do.
[00:47:29.000 --> 00:47:42.000]   But so much of the problem in the church is created because we are not engaged in the Great Commission.
[00:47:42.000 --> 00:47:47.000]   You complaining about other people not reaching out to you?
[00:47:47.000 --> 00:47:53.000]   Think how selfish that looks like from God's perspective.
[00:47:53.000 --> 00:47:56.000]   I gave you my son. You have hope in eternity.
[00:47:56.000 --> 00:48:01.000]   And you're going to live every day complaining about what you don't have
[00:48:01.000 --> 00:48:04.000]   when you are surrounded by people who are dying without Christ?
[00:48:04.000 --> 00:48:10.000]   And instead of crying for them, you're crying because you don't have the right house?
[00:48:10.000 --> 00:48:17.000]   Imagine what that sounds like, grumbling, who have Christ from God's ears.
[00:48:17.000 --> 00:48:25.000]   He's waiting for us. He's waiting for us to make up our mind. He's waiting for us.
[00:48:25.000 --> 00:48:30.000]   We're going to pray. One, if you can put up the prayer request.
[00:48:30.000 --> 00:48:36.000]   And then I'm going to ask the praise team to come up and we're going to sing as a prayer.
[00:48:36.000 --> 00:48:46.000]   OK, if I can ask the praise team to come up and after I give the prayer topics.
[00:48:46.000 --> 00:48:52.000]   I'm going to ask you guys to take some time to pray, but I'm going to ask you not to pray simply casually.
[00:48:52.000 --> 00:48:56.000]   I don't know what intense prayer looks like to you.
[00:48:56.000 --> 00:49:03.000]   But to pray intensely. Something has gone wrong with our hearts.
[00:49:03.000 --> 00:49:07.000]   Something has seriously gone wrong with our hearts.
[00:49:07.000 --> 00:49:12.000]   Our perspective, our entanglement, our view of the church, our Jewish fellowship,
[00:49:12.000 --> 00:49:16.000]   our view of safety, our view of God's blessing, all of it, something has gone wrong.
[00:49:16.000 --> 00:49:20.000]   To come before the Lord and beseech the Lord of the harvest.
[00:49:20.000 --> 00:49:24.000]   Pray for those who are nearest to you who are not Christians.
[00:49:24.000 --> 00:49:28.000]   Some of you may have given up because you've been so frustrated that you've been praying for them
[00:49:28.000 --> 00:49:33.000]   and they didn't come to Christ and maybe you're even doubting if God's going to listen.
[00:49:33.000 --> 00:49:37.000]   You need to reawaken that hope in Christ.
[00:49:37.000 --> 00:49:40.000]   To pray. Pray with urgency.
[00:49:40.000 --> 00:49:45.000]   I pray that some of you will be in tears praying for them.
[00:49:45.000 --> 00:49:49.000]   Because they don't know how to pray.
[00:49:49.000 --> 00:49:53.000]   Only your prayers intercedes for them. So pray for them desperately.
[00:49:53.000 --> 00:49:57.000]   Pray for those who you have vocational contact with.
[00:49:57.000 --> 00:50:00.000]   You know who they are. You don't interact with them much.
[00:50:00.000 --> 00:50:03.000]   But they are desperate. Pray for them.
[00:50:03.000 --> 00:50:06.000]   Don't just feel bad for them. Pray for them.
[00:50:06.000 --> 00:50:09.000]   Pray for the loss in the lives of our congregation.
[00:50:09.000 --> 00:50:12.000]   Not just for yourselves, but pray for there's many people in our church
[00:50:12.000 --> 00:50:15.000]   who are praying for their loved ones. Pray for them.
[00:50:15.000 --> 00:50:18.000]   Pray for the loss in our generation.
[00:50:18.000 --> 00:50:23.000]   In India, in Korea, in Taiwan, in Japan, and in the U.S.
[00:50:23.000 --> 00:50:26.000]   In Irvine, in your schools.
[00:50:26.000 --> 00:50:30.000]   Pray for them. Intercede. Beseech the Lord of the harvest.
[00:50:30.000 --> 00:50:33.000]   That God would use you. That God would use our church.
[00:50:33.000 --> 00:50:36.000]   To bring the gospel to them.
[00:50:36.000 --> 00:50:39.000]   Pray that God would send out more workers.
[00:50:39.000 --> 00:50:44.000]   Pray that you would become that worker.
[00:50:44.000 --> 00:50:48.000]   Pray that God would give you the courage to open your mouth wherever you are.
[00:50:48.000 --> 00:50:51.000]   You don't need to go street preaching.
[00:50:51.000 --> 00:50:54.000]   You don't need to be awkward.
[00:50:54.000 --> 00:50:57.000]   Pray, Lord, help me to be bold and open my mouth
[00:50:57.000 --> 00:51:00.000]   so that I can make the gospel clear to them.
[00:51:00.000 --> 00:51:06.000]   Pray, finally, that God would break your heart.
[00:51:06.000 --> 00:51:13.000]   If you've never prayed with compassion for the lost,
[00:51:13.000 --> 00:51:16.000]   then you do not know the heart of God yet.
[00:51:16.000 --> 00:51:23.000]   If you've never prayed with sorrow in your heart
[00:51:23.000 --> 00:51:26.000]   for those who do not know Christ, you do not fully understand.
[00:51:26.000 --> 00:51:31.000]   You may know, you may be able to repeat the mind of Christ,
[00:51:31.000 --> 00:51:34.000]   but you do not know the heart of Christ.
[00:51:34.000 --> 00:51:38.000]   When he says, if you abide in me, my words abide in you,
[00:51:38.000 --> 00:51:41.000]   ask whatever you wish, it shall be done for you.
[00:51:41.000 --> 00:51:45.000]   You know what's at the heart of that prayer?
[00:51:45.000 --> 00:51:52.000]   The heart of abiding in Christ and his word abiding in us
[00:51:52.000 --> 00:51:57.000]   is us joining him for his work.
[00:51:57.000 --> 00:52:01.000]   So pray that you would know the heart of God.
[00:52:01.000 --> 00:52:04.000]   Pray that you would be broken for the lost
[00:52:04.000 --> 00:52:07.000]   and that we would dedicate our lives.
[00:52:07.000 --> 00:52:11.000]   In wherever you are, in whatever that you are doing,
[00:52:11.000 --> 00:52:14.000]   that we would dedicate our lives, whether you are a stay-at-home mom,
[00:52:14.000 --> 00:52:17.000]   whether you are working, whether you are a student,
[00:52:17.000 --> 00:52:21.000]   that wherever you are, that God would use you to be the light.
[00:52:21.000 --> 00:52:25.000]   So we're going to sing this song together, and then we're going to give you time.
[00:52:25.000 --> 00:52:28.000]   We're going to give you a chunk of time, about 30 minutes,
[00:52:28.000 --> 00:52:30.000]   just to pray on your own, okay?
[00:52:30.000 --> 00:52:32.000]   And pray fervently for this.
[00:52:32.000 --> 00:52:35.000]   And I'm going to ask you, if you pray better when you're away from other people,
[00:52:35.000 --> 00:52:37.000]   you pray better when you're on the ground,
[00:52:37.000 --> 00:52:40.000]   we're going to move these chairs and we're going to have you sit.
[00:52:40.000 --> 00:52:43.000]   Otherwise, you can sit where you're at and just take some time.
[00:52:43.000 --> 00:52:47.000]   And if you're wrestling with prayer, don't give up.
[00:52:47.000 --> 00:52:50.000]   Our natural tendency is as soon as our mind begins to wander somewhere,
[00:52:50.000 --> 00:52:52.000]   we think, "Oh, I'm having a hard time," and you quit.
[00:52:52.000 --> 00:52:54.000]   Don't quit.
[00:52:54.000 --> 00:52:59.000]   Just like Jesus told his disciples, "Couldn't you stay awake for one hour?"
[00:52:59.000 --> 00:53:02.000]   It's because they didn't understand what was coming.
[00:53:02.000 --> 00:53:06.000]   The reason why our mind wanders is because we don't understand the seriousness
[00:53:06.000 --> 00:53:09.000]   of what God has called us to.
[00:53:09.000 --> 00:53:13.000]   So if you see yourself wandering, pray, persevere and pray.
[00:53:13.000 --> 00:53:15.000]   Go take a break if you need to.
[00:53:15.000 --> 00:53:19.000]   Come back, drink a cup of water, but wrestle in prayer.
[00:53:19.000 --> 00:53:21.000]   Don't just give up.
[00:53:21.000 --> 00:53:24.000]   So let's sing this song together, and then I'm going to lead you
[00:53:24.000 --> 00:53:28.000]   and ask you to take some time to pray on your own.
[00:53:28.000 --> 00:53:38.000]   [music]
[00:53:38.000 --> 00:53:49.000]   Make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry.
[00:53:49.000 --> 00:53:59.000]   Blow my heart so that you may dry.
[00:53:59.000 --> 00:54:10.000]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:54:10.000 --> 00:54:29.000]   Cause me to be one who's set free to stand as a house of prayer.
[00:54:29.000 --> 00:54:36.000]   [music]

[00:54:57.000 --> 00:55:07.000]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:55:07.000 --> 00:55:26.000]   Cause us to be one who's set free to stand as a house of prayer.
[00:55:26.000 --> 00:55:34.000]   [music]
[00:55:34.000 --> 00:55:44.000]   Make me a prayer, let my prayers be a cry.

[00:55:54.000 --> 00:56:04.000]   Cause me to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:56:04.000 --> 00:56:27.000]   Cause me to be one who's set free to stand as a house of prayer.
[00:56:27.000 --> 00:56:32.000]   [music]
[00:56:32.000 --> 00:56:42.000]   Make us a prayer, let our prayers be a cry.
[00:56:42.000 --> 00:56:52.000]   Blow our hearts so that you may dry.
[00:56:52.000 --> 00:57:02.000]   Cause us to stand and cry out for this land.
[00:57:02.000 --> 00:57:23.000]   Cause us to be a people who's set free to stand as a house of prayer.
[00:57:23.000 --> 00:57:33.000]   Cause us to stand as a house of prayer.
[00:57:33.000 --> 00:57:39.000]   Let's take some time to pray and in about 25 minutes I'll knock on the podium to get us back together.
[00:57:39.000 --> 00:57:44.000]   So let's take some time to pray on our own.

[01:18:44.000 --> 01:18:51.000]   If I can ask now if I can get together with about three people around you and then designate what to pray for.
[01:18:51.000 --> 01:18:57.000]   And so if you have specific things that you're praying for, certain people, to take some time to pray.
[01:18:57.000 --> 01:19:01.000]   Now you've prayed for them, now ask them to pray for you.
[01:19:01.000 --> 01:19:06.000]   And then pray again, pray for all, just divvy up the things and take some time to pray.
[01:19:06.000 --> 01:19:12.000]   And then after about 10, 15 minutes, our prayer team is going to come up and I'm going to pray for us and then we'll wrap up our evening.
[01:19:12.000 --> 01:19:16.000]   Okay? So if you want to continue to pray on your own, you're more than welcome to do that.
[01:19:16.000 --> 01:19:19.000]   Otherwise, turn around and try to grab about three people around you.
[01:19:19.000 --> 01:19:22.000]   Try not to make it more than three because you're not going to be able to hear each other.
[01:19:22.000 --> 01:19:25.000]   So just get together and if you want to move around, you can move around.
[01:19:25.000 --> 01:19:30.000]   So let's do that for the next about 10 minutes and then I'll call us back when we're about to finish.

[01:35:51.000 --> 01:36:00.000]   Lord, I pray that as you've heard our prayers,
[01:36:00.000 --> 01:36:04.000]   Lord, would you open a door for the gospel
[01:36:04.000 --> 01:36:08.000]   to be heard, Lord God, for those people who are around us,
[01:36:08.000 --> 01:36:09.000]   the people that we love.
[01:36:09.000 --> 01:36:14.000]   Lord, if we have given up hope because it's been so long,
[01:36:14.000 --> 01:36:18.000]   I pray that you would rekindle in our hearts, Lord God,
[01:36:18.000 --> 01:36:21.000]   a desperateness to intercede on their behalf.
[01:36:21.000 --> 01:36:25.000]   Help us to open our eyes to see the lost
[01:36:25.000 --> 01:36:28.000]   that we are working with, that we are studying with,
[01:36:28.000 --> 01:36:30.000]   that we are surrounded by.
[01:36:30.000 --> 01:36:34.000]   Lord, they are like sheep without shepherd.
[01:36:34.000 --> 01:36:37.000]   Lord, they are dispirited.
[01:36:37.000 --> 01:36:42.000]   Lord, they are lost, Lord God, because they do not know you.
[01:36:42.000 --> 01:36:46.000]   I pray that as you have given us hope,
[01:36:46.000 --> 01:36:50.000]   help us, Lord God, to be a conduit of hope in this lost world.
[01:36:50.000 --> 01:36:55.000]   Lord, I pray that the greatest joy that we would experience in this life
[01:36:55.000 --> 01:36:58.000]   would be to see the lost come to Christ.
[01:36:58.000 --> 01:37:04.000]   Fixate our eyes, Lord God, upon the things that you are fixated on,
[01:37:04.000 --> 01:37:07.000]   that we may follow the footsteps, Lord,
[01:37:07.000 --> 01:37:09.000]   of the cloud of witnesses that have gone before us.
[01:37:09.000 --> 01:37:12.000]   So many saints, so many missionaries,
[01:37:13.000 --> 01:37:17.000]   so many church members, Lord God, who have gone before us,
[01:37:17.000 --> 01:37:20.000]   that brought the gospel to us.
[01:37:20.000 --> 01:37:23.000]   Help us, Lord God, to take that baton,
[01:37:23.000 --> 01:37:27.000]   that in our generation, but for our inheritance,
[01:37:27.000 --> 01:37:29.000]   that you would give us the lost.
[01:37:29.000 --> 01:37:33.000]   Open our eyes, soften our hearts, Lord God.
[01:37:33.000 --> 01:37:36.000]   Give us compassion for them.
[01:37:36.000 --> 01:37:39.000]   Help us to intercede for them.
[01:37:39.000 --> 01:37:42.000]   Help us, Lord God, to cry out on their behalf.
[01:37:43.000 --> 01:37:47.000]   That we may see many, many more people come to Christ
[01:37:47.000 --> 01:37:50.000]   through our church, through our efforts,
[01:37:50.000 --> 01:37:53.000]   through our fellowship, through our giving,
[01:37:53.000 --> 01:37:56.000]   through our sacrifices, through our study.
[01:37:56.000 --> 01:38:00.000]   May it all, Lord God, bring glory to your name.
[01:38:00.000 --> 01:38:04.000]   Help us, Lord God, if we have been entangled
[01:38:04.000 --> 01:38:06.000]   with things that don't matter.
[01:38:06.000 --> 01:38:09.000]   Help us, Lord, to number our days.
[01:38:10.000 --> 01:38:13.000]   That we may see them, Lord God, in the light of eternity.
[01:38:13.000 --> 01:38:16.000]   That we may give all that we have
[01:38:16.000 --> 01:38:19.000]   for the sake of what you've done for us.
[01:38:19.000 --> 01:38:21.000]   Bring revival.
[01:38:21.000 --> 01:38:23.000]   Revive our church.
[01:38:23.000 --> 01:38:25.000]   Revive our families.

[01:38:35.000 --> 01:38:36.000]   Revive the old.
[01:38:36.000 --> 01:38:38.000]   Revive us, Lord God.
[01:38:39.000 --> 01:38:41.000]   That our worship may be in spirit and in truth.
[01:38:41.000 --> 01:38:43.000]   Send us.
[01:38:43.000 --> 01:38:46.000]   Send us.
[01:38:46.000 --> 01:38:49.000]   That you would raise up people who are willing to go
[01:38:49.000 --> 01:38:51.000]   for the sake of your name.
[01:38:51.000 --> 01:38:53.000]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:38:53.000 --> 01:38:56.000]   Thank you.
