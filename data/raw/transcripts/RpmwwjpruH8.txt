[00:02:38.200 --> 00:02:48.400]   - All right, good morning, church family.
[00:02:48.400 --> 00:02:49.320]   Happy Lord's Day.
[00:02:49.320 --> 00:02:50.840]   Hope you had a good week in the Lord.
[00:02:50.840 --> 00:02:52.320]   As always, it's a privilege and a joy
[00:02:52.320 --> 00:02:54.760]   for us to gather together for worship.
[00:02:54.760 --> 00:02:56.040]   If I may, I'd like to begin
[00:02:56.040 --> 00:02:57.840]   by reading a few verses from Psalms.
[00:02:57.840 --> 00:03:02.720]   Psalm 63, verses one to three.
[00:03:03.800 --> 00:03:05.280]   Oh God, you are my God.
[00:03:05.280 --> 00:03:07.200]   I shall seek you earnestly.
[00:03:07.200 --> 00:03:08.680]   My soul thirsts for you.
[00:03:08.680 --> 00:03:10.320]   My flesh yearns for you.
[00:03:10.320 --> 00:03:13.640]   In a dry and weary land where there is no water.
[00:03:13.640 --> 00:03:16.120]   Thus I have seen you in the sanctuary
[00:03:16.120 --> 00:03:18.160]   to see your power and your glory.
[00:03:18.160 --> 00:03:21.040]   Because your loving kindness is better than life,
[00:03:21.040 --> 00:03:23.120]   my lips will praise you.
[00:03:23.120 --> 00:03:24.560]   So this morning, let us seek him
[00:03:24.560 --> 00:03:27.000]   and praise him for his loving kindness together.

[00:06:46.080 --> 00:07:00.240]   - All right, good morning.
[00:07:00.240 --> 00:07:01.920]   Welcome to Breen Community Church.
[00:07:01.920 --> 00:07:04.520]   Let me get to a few announcements before we get started.
[00:07:04.520 --> 00:07:07.360]   First of all, next Sunday, as you guys know,
[00:07:07.360 --> 00:07:08.760]   it's Father's Day.
[00:07:08.760 --> 00:07:11.920]   And so our children's department and the children,
[00:07:11.920 --> 00:07:14.420]   they have snacks and milk tea and various things
[00:07:14.420 --> 00:07:16.320]   that are prepared for the fathers next Sunday.
[00:07:16.320 --> 00:07:17.920]   So after each of the service,
[00:07:17.920 --> 00:07:19.380]   there will be booths set up outside.
[00:07:19.380 --> 00:07:22.280]   So whether you are here or you're gonna bring a father
[00:07:22.280 --> 00:07:25.560]   to the service, make sure you visit that again
[00:07:25.560 --> 00:07:27.680]   after the service next Sunday.
[00:07:27.680 --> 00:07:29.480]   Breen membership class.
[00:07:29.480 --> 00:07:33.080]   So this is an eight-week course starting from about 9.30
[00:07:33.080 --> 00:07:36.680]   to about 9.30 to 11.
[00:07:36.680 --> 00:07:39.480]   And so the eight-week course covers
[00:07:39.480 --> 00:07:41.520]   the fundamental doctrines of our church,
[00:07:41.520 --> 00:07:43.280]   ministry philosophies,
[00:07:43.280 --> 00:07:46.080]   and so to get to know some of our leaders.
[00:07:46.080 --> 00:07:48.000]   And so if you wanna become a member of the church,
[00:07:48.000 --> 00:07:48.980]   please sign up for that.
[00:07:48.980 --> 00:07:51.840]   And the beginning of that is going to be on July 7th.
[00:07:51.840 --> 00:07:54.720]   So we have about a few more weeks before.
[00:07:54.720 --> 00:07:57.160]   So if you're planning to take it, please do that.
[00:07:57.160 --> 00:08:00.760]   And then at 9.30, at across the way,
[00:08:00.760 --> 00:08:01.760]   not on the cafe side,
[00:08:01.760 --> 00:08:04.320]   but the other side where the youth group meets,
[00:08:04.320 --> 00:08:05.920]   that's where the membership class takes place.
[00:08:05.920 --> 00:08:07.280]   So please sign up for that.
[00:08:07.280 --> 00:08:10.000]   And that's what that, it'll begin on July 7th.
[00:08:10.000 --> 00:08:12.720]   And lastly, jubilee picnic.
[00:08:12.720 --> 00:08:15.840]   So if you are 50 and over in the church,
[00:08:15.840 --> 00:08:17.600]   and I know if you're new to the church and you say,
[00:08:17.600 --> 00:08:20.760]   "Well, do anybody over 50 in this church?"
[00:08:20.760 --> 00:08:23.400]   When we actually gather, there's actually quite a few of us.
[00:08:23.400 --> 00:08:24.940]   So we have a fellowship going on
[00:08:24.940 --> 00:08:26.360]   that takes place quarterly,
[00:08:26.360 --> 00:08:29.880]   but on July 14th at 1 p.m. after the third service,
[00:08:29.880 --> 00:08:31.480]   there'll be a jubilee picnic
[00:08:31.480 --> 00:08:34.000]   that's gonna be taking place at a local park.
[00:08:34.000 --> 00:08:35.560]   So please sign up for that.
[00:08:35.560 --> 00:08:36.880]   I think lunch will be provided
[00:08:36.880 --> 00:08:39.320]   and it can be a casual time to meet other people
[00:08:39.320 --> 00:08:41.520]   of similar age if you're 50 and over.
[00:08:41.520 --> 00:08:45.840]   Please come join us for that on July 14th, okay?
[00:08:45.840 --> 00:08:47.120]   All right, let me pray for us.
[00:08:47.120 --> 00:08:49.400]   Then after we pray and our praise,
[00:08:49.400 --> 00:08:51.400]   Joshua Yu is gonna come up
[00:08:51.400 --> 00:08:52.480]   and he's going to give his testimony
[00:08:52.480 --> 00:08:54.360]   and be baptized this morning.
[00:08:54.360 --> 00:08:56.360]   If you are, again, new to the church
[00:08:56.360 --> 00:08:57.720]   and you have physical offering,
[00:08:57.720 --> 00:08:59.220]   there is a box in the back
[00:08:59.220 --> 00:09:00.880]   that you can visit on the way out, all right?
[00:09:00.880 --> 00:09:01.720]   Let's pray.
[00:09:05.000 --> 00:09:08.640]   Father, we thank you so much for your love and kindness
[00:09:08.640 --> 00:09:10.800]   that you pour upon us.
[00:09:10.800 --> 00:09:13.400]   Lord, we genuinely desire to worship you
[00:09:13.400 --> 00:09:15.040]   in spirit and in truth.
[00:09:15.040 --> 00:09:18.240]   Guide us, lead us,
[00:09:18.240 --> 00:09:21.480]   that we may focus our full attention on Christ,
[00:09:21.480 --> 00:09:24.200]   our singing, our listening,
[00:09:24.200 --> 00:09:27.280]   that we would apply all that you have to teach us.
[00:09:27.280 --> 00:09:29.020]   May this morning be filled
[00:09:29.020 --> 00:09:31.600]   with your blessing and your presence.
[00:09:31.600 --> 00:09:33.600]   And even in this giving,
[00:09:33.600 --> 00:09:35.800]   help us, Lord God, to give in a manner
[00:09:35.800 --> 00:09:37.440]   worthy of the gospel that you've given.
[00:09:37.440 --> 00:09:39.680]   May it be multiplied for the sake of your kingdom.
[00:09:39.680 --> 00:09:41.980]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[00:09:41.980 --> 00:09:45.060]   (gentle piano music)
[00:09:45.060 --> 00:09:48.980]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:09:48.980 --> 00:09:52.900]   (gentle piano music continues)
[00:09:52.900 --> 00:10:17.700]   - All right, would you please stand together
[00:10:17.700 --> 00:10:19.900]   and take a moment to say hello to those around you,
[00:10:19.900 --> 00:10:22.420]   and we'll begin and continue our worship.

[00:19:40.720 --> 00:19:44.220]   - Hello, my name is Joshua Yoo, and this is my testimony.
[00:19:44.220 --> 00:19:46.920]   I grew up attending church my whole life,
[00:19:46.920 --> 00:19:49.420]   but I was only a part-time Christian.
[00:19:49.420 --> 00:19:53.220]   In other words, I was not a Christian at all.
[00:19:53.220 --> 00:19:56.520]   I only pretended to be a stereotypical nice Christian boy
[00:19:56.520 --> 00:19:58.120]   when I was inside church,
[00:19:58.120 --> 00:20:01.020]   but every single second I got outside of church,
[00:20:01.020 --> 00:20:05.420]   I spent all my time constantly lying, bullying, stealing,
[00:20:05.420 --> 00:20:08.020]   and just judging everyone else.
[00:20:08.020 --> 00:20:11.120]   I did not care about how others felt.
[00:20:11.120 --> 00:20:13.820]   I just wanted to do what I wanted to do.
[00:20:13.820 --> 00:20:17.320]   I only helped others when it benefited me.
[00:20:17.320 --> 00:20:20.420]   I only claimed, I constantly claimed to be a Christian,
[00:20:20.420 --> 00:20:22.220]   but I was not.
[00:20:22.220 --> 00:20:24.520]   I was just a hypocrite.
[00:20:24.520 --> 00:20:28.220]   I craved attention, power, and control.
[00:20:28.220 --> 00:20:31.820]   I wanted money, status, and fame.
[00:20:31.820 --> 00:20:35.020]   And I wanted others to think that I was cool and strong.
[00:20:37.220 --> 00:20:39.620]   And I wanted other people to look up to me,
[00:20:39.620 --> 00:20:41.020]   and I want them to desire me.
[00:20:41.020 --> 00:20:44.620]   And worst of all, I got exactly what I wanted.
[00:20:44.620 --> 00:20:45.520]   Straight out of high school,
[00:20:45.520 --> 00:20:47.520]   I got the fortunate opportunity to work
[00:20:47.520 --> 00:20:50.020]   with one of the top entertainment agencies,
[00:20:50.020 --> 00:20:52.820]   where I regularly got to meet with celebrities
[00:20:52.820 --> 00:20:56.320]   and other members of social media.
[00:20:56.320 --> 00:21:00.220]   And I finally felt like I had it all.
[00:21:00.220 --> 00:21:02.020]   You know, my friends would come up to me,
[00:21:02.020 --> 00:21:03.220]   and they would give me praise,
[00:21:03.220 --> 00:21:06.420]   and a lot of other people would come up to me
[00:21:06.420 --> 00:21:08.620]   and tell me that they wanted what I had.
[00:21:08.620 --> 00:21:11.620]   And I finally felt like I was successful,
[00:21:11.620 --> 00:21:13.920]   and I felt powerful,
[00:21:13.920 --> 00:21:18.620]   and I even benefited from having a somewhat social status.
[00:21:18.620 --> 00:21:22.320]   But all of this, it never fulfilled me at all.
[00:21:22.320 --> 00:21:26.620]   I was still extremely empty and broken inside.
[00:21:26.620 --> 00:21:28.120]   It was never enough.
[00:21:28.120 --> 00:21:31.820]   And every time I got what I wanted,
[00:21:31.820 --> 00:21:32.920]   I just wanted more,
[00:21:32.920 --> 00:21:37.120]   and I realized I was just chasing empty pursuits.
[00:21:37.120 --> 00:21:41.020]   My career eventually collapsed,
[00:21:41.020 --> 00:21:44.320]   and I felt even more empty, more broken,
[00:21:44.320 --> 00:21:48.220]   and more alone than I ever had in my whole life.
[00:21:48.220 --> 00:21:51.420]   I lost everything that I felt that I earned.
[00:21:51.420 --> 00:21:55.120]   I lost everything that I believed was rightfully mine.
[00:21:55.120 --> 00:21:57.020]   During this low point of my life,
[00:21:57.020 --> 00:21:59.820]   I heard about Berean Community Church
[00:21:59.820 --> 00:22:02.720]   through some old friends of mine.
[00:22:02.720 --> 00:22:03.820]   I only decided to attend
[00:22:03.820 --> 00:22:07.420]   because I really had nothing else to do with my life.
[00:22:07.420 --> 00:22:08.920]   My whole life fell apart anyway,
[00:22:08.920 --> 00:22:12.020]   so how worse can it really get?
[00:22:12.020 --> 00:22:15.920]   And as soon as I arrived,
[00:22:15.920 --> 00:22:19.620]   everyone was so accepting of who I am as a person,
[00:22:19.620 --> 00:22:22.520]   and it really confused me.
[00:22:22.520 --> 00:22:23.720]   I was so confused.
[00:22:23.720 --> 00:22:24.920]   Like, who are these people?
[00:22:24.920 --> 00:22:26.520]   Like, why are they so nice to me?
[00:22:26.520 --> 00:22:31.320]   Why do they even care about a terrible person such as myself?
[00:22:32.320 --> 00:22:35.820]   And I found all these people to be very intriguing,
[00:22:35.820 --> 00:22:38.420]   so I showed up the following week,
[00:22:38.420 --> 00:22:41.020]   and then again, and again.
[00:22:41.020 --> 00:22:43.420]   Now, the only reason why I kept coming out to church
[00:22:43.420 --> 00:22:46.320]   was not because I wanted to follow Christ
[00:22:46.320 --> 00:22:48.520]   or not because I wanted to better myself,
[00:22:48.520 --> 00:22:52.920]   but because I just happened to like the people that I met here.
[00:22:52.920 --> 00:22:54.720]   But God had very different intentions
[00:22:54.720 --> 00:22:57.520]   and very different reasons for me coming to church.
[00:22:57.520 --> 00:23:00.020]   I realized these people treated me with love
[00:23:00.020 --> 00:23:02.620]   because they loved God.
[00:23:02.620 --> 00:23:04.320]   The more time I spent at church,
[00:23:04.320 --> 00:23:07.420]   the more I realized my own brokenness and emptiness.
[00:23:07.420 --> 00:23:11.920]   God opened my eyes to all of my own destructive habits
[00:23:11.920 --> 00:23:15.520]   and other bad habits.
[00:23:15.520 --> 00:23:18.120]   I became disgusted by my own actions,
[00:23:18.120 --> 00:23:21.620]   my own sinful actions that I committed every single day.
[00:23:21.620 --> 00:23:25.120]   I realized I was truly broken inside,
[00:23:25.120 --> 00:23:28.420]   and I needed a Savior.
[00:23:28.420 --> 00:23:30.520]   But I still had so much doubt.
[00:23:30.520 --> 00:23:31.620]   I mean, sermon after sermon,
[00:23:31.620 --> 00:23:34.520]   I kept hearing about this Almighty God
[00:23:34.520 --> 00:23:37.520]   and how marvelous and great the Bible is.
[00:23:37.520 --> 00:23:39.620]   But how do I know this God is real?
[00:23:39.620 --> 00:23:42.320]   And why should I even trust the Bible at all?
[00:23:42.320 --> 00:23:46.220]   Why do I even need to follow a thing the Bible says?
[00:23:46.220 --> 00:23:47.420]   So for the first time in my life,
[00:23:47.420 --> 00:23:50.420]   I decided to study the Bible.
[00:23:50.420 --> 00:23:54.120]   Reading this book was so challenging and brutal.
[00:23:54.120 --> 00:23:55.620]   It gave me answers to my questions,
[00:23:55.620 --> 00:23:58.620]   but it also offended me.
[00:23:58.620 --> 00:24:01.320]   I felt like the Bible attacked my way of life,
[00:24:01.320 --> 00:24:05.020]   and it told me that what I wanted was inherently wrong.
[00:24:05.020 --> 00:24:07.920]   But through this painful process
[00:24:07.920 --> 00:24:10.320]   and helpful guidance from everyone around me,
[00:24:10.320 --> 00:24:13.520]   I came to the realization that God is indeed real,
[00:24:13.520 --> 00:24:17.220]   and I believed Him.
[00:24:17.220 --> 00:24:20.820]   Then I had to ask myself a series of very important questions.
[00:24:20.820 --> 00:24:23.520]   If I truly believe in a God that is all-powerful,
[00:24:23.520 --> 00:24:27.320]   and I have faith in Him,
[00:24:27.320 --> 00:24:30.120]   does His commands need to change to fit my lifestyle,
[00:24:30.120 --> 00:24:33.320]   or do I need to change my lifestyle to fit His commands?
[00:24:33.320 --> 00:24:37.720]   Who is more right, God's way or my own desires?
[00:24:37.720 --> 00:24:40.220]   I had to come and accept the fact
[00:24:40.220 --> 00:24:44.620]   that just because I did not like the truth gave me no right.
[00:24:44.620 --> 00:24:46.420]   Just because I did not like the truth,
[00:24:46.420 --> 00:24:49.520]   it does not give me the right to reject the truth.
[00:24:49.520 --> 00:24:52.620]   So I stand here today as a sinner.
[00:24:52.620 --> 00:24:55.620]   I'm not perfect. I'm not a genius.
[00:24:55.620 --> 00:24:58.420]   I'm not better than anybody.
[00:24:58.420 --> 00:25:01.420]   I believe the Bible is true. I believe God is real.
[00:25:01.420 --> 00:25:03.720]   I accept Jesus as my Lord and Savior.
[00:25:03.720 --> 00:25:05.520]   I submit myself to God.
[00:25:05.520 --> 00:25:09.620]   I accept God as the highest level of authority in my life.
[00:25:09.620 --> 00:25:13.920]   I am saved. I stand here today because I placed my faith in God.
[00:25:13.920 --> 00:25:16.920]   Thank you.
[00:25:16.920 --> 00:25:39.120]   Joshua, do you understand when you're going to the water,
[00:25:39.120 --> 00:25:40.620]   you're being united to Christ's death,
[00:25:40.620 --> 00:25:41.520]   and then when you're coming out,
[00:25:41.520 --> 00:25:43.320]   you're being united to His resurrected life?
[00:25:43.320 --> 00:25:44.120]   I do.
[00:25:44.120 --> 00:25:46.120]   And I baptize you in the name of the Father,
[00:25:46.120 --> 00:25:48.920]   the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[00:25:48.920 --> 00:26:07.420]   All right. Thank you, Joshua.
[00:26:07.420 --> 00:26:13.420]   If you can turn your Bible with me to Luke chapter 8, verses 19 to 21.
[00:26:13.420 --> 00:26:15.420]   Okay.
[00:26:15.420 --> 00:26:21.620]   Luke chapter 8, verse 19 to 21.
[00:26:21.620 --> 00:26:30.220]   "And his mother and brothers came to him,
[00:26:30.220 --> 00:26:34.220]   and they were unable to get to him because of the crowd.
[00:26:34.220 --> 00:26:35.320]   And it was reported to him,
[00:26:35.320 --> 00:26:39.420]   'Your mother and your brothers are standing outside wishing to see you.'
[00:26:39.420 --> 00:26:40.620]   But he answered and said to them,
[00:26:40.620 --> 00:26:45.220]   'My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.'"
[00:26:45.220 --> 00:26:47.520]   Let's pray.
[00:26:47.520 --> 00:26:50.420]   Father, we pray for understanding.
[00:26:50.420 --> 00:26:53.020]   We pray to know your heart.
[00:26:53.020 --> 00:26:55.720]   Help us, Lord God, to be more than just mere hearers,
[00:26:55.720 --> 00:26:57.220]   but be doers of your word.
[00:26:57.220 --> 00:27:00.320]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[00:27:00.320 --> 00:27:05.420]   How many of you have heard of the name Katelyn Clark recently?
[00:27:05.420 --> 00:27:10.720]   Okay. I'm assuming if you will, when any kind of social media,
[00:27:10.720 --> 00:27:14.120]   I mean, she's been the probably number one news that's been going on.
[00:27:14.120 --> 00:27:19.520]   And recently she broke the attendance record that matched the NBA Finals,
[00:27:19.520 --> 00:27:21.820]   over 20,000 people in the arena.
[00:27:21.820 --> 00:27:23.720]   And so she's been followed.
[00:27:23.720 --> 00:27:27.420]   And obviously she's been on the news about how she's breaking all the records.
[00:27:27.420 --> 00:27:31.420]   And so large crowds are following her.
[00:27:31.420 --> 00:27:35.420]   But along with that, there's a lot of criticism, a lot of jealousy,
[00:27:35.420 --> 00:27:37.320]   and a lot of hatred that's going toward her.
[00:27:37.320 --> 00:27:39.320]   So that's also become a big part of the media.
[00:27:39.320 --> 00:27:42.720]   So if you've been watching, you know the discussion that's going on.
[00:27:42.720 --> 00:27:48.220]   And the reason why I'm bringing up her name is because the crowd that is following Jesus is growing.
[00:27:48.220 --> 00:27:51.920]   And what's interesting is it was hard for me not to kind of relate to what's going on.
[00:27:51.920 --> 00:27:57.520]   Not that Katelyn Clark is any kind of messiah, right, but she is changing the WNBA.
[00:27:57.520 --> 00:28:01.020]   Because there's been so much talk about how people are not watching,
[00:28:01.020 --> 00:28:02.620]   and they're not getting paid enough.
[00:28:02.620 --> 00:28:07.020]   And all of a sudden this one girl shows up and she's breaking all the records,
[00:28:07.020 --> 00:28:09.320]   and the attendance is going through the roof.
[00:28:09.320 --> 00:28:14.520]   But along with that, the same people who've been complaining about how they're not being paid enough,
[00:28:14.520 --> 00:28:21.220]   and people are not watching, a lot of them are the ones who are criticizing and making it difficult for her, right?
[00:28:21.220 --> 00:28:25.120]   Again, my point is not talking about Katelyn Clark this morning, right?
[00:28:25.120 --> 00:28:30.820]   But the text that we're looking at says the crowd around Jesus is growing so large
[00:28:30.820 --> 00:28:35.420]   that they're having a hard time containing them, and it's still in the process of growing.
[00:28:35.420 --> 00:28:40.020]   And people have been waiting for the messiah for hundreds of years,
[00:28:40.020 --> 00:28:45.120]   telling each other that no matter how difficult it is, when the messiah comes, he's going to fix everything.
[00:28:45.120 --> 00:28:49.920]   But now that the messiah has shown up and he's giving all the evidence of a genuine messiah,
[00:28:49.920 --> 00:28:56.020]   the same people who've been teaching them that the messiah is coming is slowly beginning to turn against him.
[00:28:56.020 --> 00:29:01.020]   Jealousy. And eventually their jealousy is going to grow to the point where they're going to turn him in,
[00:29:01.020 --> 00:29:03.520]   and then they're going to crucify him.
[00:29:03.520 --> 00:29:09.520]   Well, the text tells us that this crowd was so large that his own family members couldn't get to him.
[00:29:09.520 --> 00:29:15.120]   And what he says in this text, on the surface, looks very insensitive.
[00:29:15.120 --> 00:29:19.420]   Can you imagine if Caitlin Clark is playing, and you have 20,000 people coming,
[00:29:19.420 --> 00:29:23.820]   and the officials or the attendants are coming, and they say,
[00:29:23.820 --> 00:29:28.520]   "Hey, Caitlin, your mom and your brothers are outside, and they can't get to you because the crowd is too large."
[00:29:28.520 --> 00:29:35.520]   And then Caitlin turns around and says, "These are my brothers. That's my mother from this point on."
[00:29:35.520 --> 00:29:38.920]   So if you read that from the surface, and you don't really ask the question,
[00:29:38.920 --> 00:29:43.320]   or you may look at that and say, "Oh, Jesus really doesn't care about his mom, right?
[00:29:43.320 --> 00:29:46.920]   He doesn't really care about his sisters." It sounds very insensitive
[00:29:46.920 --> 00:29:53.020]   if you don't understand the context of what he is saying and why he's saying this.
[00:29:53.020 --> 00:29:56.920]   There's two points that I want to make from this text to help us to understand what's going on
[00:29:56.920 --> 00:29:59.620]   and why he's saying what he is saying.
[00:29:59.620 --> 00:30:01.620]   And under the second, there's two points.
[00:30:01.620 --> 00:30:05.520]   Okay, so actually there's four points, actually three points, okay?
[00:30:05.520 --> 00:30:12.620]   So the first thing that we need to understand is Jesus is declaring to us absolute allegiance to God first.
[00:30:12.620 --> 00:30:18.220]   Absolute allegiance to God first. On the surface, again, it may sound very insensitive.
[00:30:18.220 --> 00:30:22.320]   In fact, if you understand the context in Jesus' speaking,
[00:30:22.320 --> 00:30:27.920]   I think it will help us, and initially it would make it even worse, right?
[00:30:27.920 --> 00:30:33.720]   You know what's really interesting about the Bible is the Bible is written in two very distinct cultures.
[00:30:33.720 --> 00:30:39.920]   You have the Old Testament, the Hebrew culture, by tradition was an Asian culture.
[00:30:39.920 --> 00:30:45.920]   It's very honorific where you honor your grandparents and great-grandparents.
[00:30:45.920 --> 00:30:50.120]   In fact, the typical Jewish home had three generations.
[00:30:50.120 --> 00:30:54.020]   You had grandparents, the parents, and the children. That was very typical.
[00:30:54.020 --> 00:30:58.420]   And so that unit, when they said family, like today when you say family,
[00:30:58.420 --> 00:31:00.120]   we're talking about mom, dad, and the kids.
[00:31:00.120 --> 00:31:05.220]   But in the Jewish home, it was mom, dad, grandparents, grandmother, and their children,
[00:31:05.220 --> 00:31:06.920]   and they stayed together as long as possible.
[00:31:06.920 --> 00:31:11.520]   In fact, even in the United States, it was probably that structure until not that long ago,
[00:31:11.520 --> 00:31:15.320]   maybe 50, 60 years ago.
[00:31:15.320 --> 00:31:18.920]   So family, in this tradition, meant everything.
[00:31:18.920 --> 00:31:23.420]   In fact, if you read the Old Testament, whenever a character is introduced,
[00:31:23.420 --> 00:31:28.020]   they would not only tell them who they are, they would tell them who their parents are.
[00:31:28.020 --> 00:31:32.220]   In Zephaniah 1.1, it said, "The word of the Lord came to Zephaniah, son of Cushi,
[00:31:32.220 --> 00:31:39.020]   son of Gedaliah, son of Amoriah, son of Hezekiah, in the days of Josiah, son of Ammon, king of Judah."
[00:31:39.020 --> 00:31:41.820]   Imagine today, if we're introducing something and say,
[00:31:41.820 --> 00:31:46.920]   "I'm the son of Charles, the son of Jack, the son of John, the son of this," right?
[00:31:46.920 --> 00:31:49.820]   And they say, "Well, why are you saying all of that?"
[00:31:49.820 --> 00:31:53.720]   But this reveals to us their culture, right?
[00:31:53.720 --> 00:31:57.920]   And it's a very Asian culture. Even the language itself is very Asian.
[00:31:57.920 --> 00:32:03.420]   So if you look at the Asian culture, their language isn't very precise.
[00:32:03.420 --> 00:32:05.620]   It's more poetic.
[00:32:05.620 --> 00:32:13.220]   And so if you read poetry or you read narratives, you get the sense of how they felt, right?
[00:32:13.220 --> 00:32:17.420]   But if you wanted to write a legal document, you need a precise language,
[00:32:17.420 --> 00:32:22.720]   the tense and what it relates to, and that's the Greek.
[00:32:22.720 --> 00:32:26.620]   So Hebrew is great at writing poetry and narratives,
[00:32:26.620 --> 00:32:32.320]   and Greek is much better and precise in writing documents.
[00:32:32.320 --> 00:32:35.120]   And it makes so much sense because when you go to the New Testament,
[00:32:35.120 --> 00:32:41.020]   they're writing very specific doctrinal statements that describe for us in detail
[00:32:41.020 --> 00:32:45.120]   God's holiness and his relationship and atonement and what that means to the church,
[00:32:45.120 --> 00:32:48.920]   the future coming of Christ, our relationship, how we got saved.
[00:32:48.920 --> 00:32:56.420]   And so all of these things are written in very descriptive language to write a legal document.
[00:32:56.420 --> 00:32:59.220]   So that you and I can understand precisely.
[00:32:59.220 --> 00:33:02.820]   The Old Testament written in Hebrew where so much of it is poetry.
[00:33:02.820 --> 00:33:06.220]   When you read the narratives, when you read the poetry,
[00:33:06.220 --> 00:33:10.920]   you get the sense of how God feels, what the people are feeling.
[00:33:10.920 --> 00:33:16.420]   So I would say generally speaking, that's probably the distinction that I felt.
[00:33:16.420 --> 00:33:20.820]   Being an Asian American, that there is a very strong distinction
[00:33:20.820 --> 00:33:23.120]   between the Asian culture and the Western culture.
[00:33:23.120 --> 00:33:27.820]   The Western culture prides itself of being independent.
[00:33:27.820 --> 00:33:29.920]   Especially in America, we're independent.
[00:33:29.920 --> 00:33:35.320]   But in the Asian culture, independence isn't considered mature.
[00:33:35.320 --> 00:33:39.920]   In the Asian culture, until you acknowledge your parents and grandparents,
[00:33:39.920 --> 00:33:44.020]   until you're mature enough to be able to recognize your heritage,
[00:33:44.020 --> 00:33:47.620]   they say you're not mature, you're immature.
[00:33:47.620 --> 00:33:53.320]   So Jesus is speaking to a culture that is Asian by nature,
[00:33:53.320 --> 00:33:55.720]   but it's beginning to transition to the Western culture.
[00:33:55.720 --> 00:34:01.320]   So Jesus' time that the Jews were very Asian American,
[00:34:01.320 --> 00:34:04.820]   which many of us have the advantage of understanding.
[00:34:04.820 --> 00:34:07.320]   They have two clashing cultures,
[00:34:07.320 --> 00:34:12.020]   where the Greeks and the Romans are beginning to influence the younger generation.
[00:34:12.020 --> 00:34:16.920]   And even the language is being changed to Aramaic, to Greek.
[00:34:16.920 --> 00:34:23.820]   But then the older tradition comes from a very Asian, honorific parent generation.
[00:34:23.820 --> 00:34:27.720]   Now, all of this I'm saying to you as a background, so you can understand.
[00:34:27.720 --> 00:34:31.720]   And I think again, many of you may understand.
[00:34:31.720 --> 00:34:34.720]   Jesus himself was in a very unique situation,
[00:34:34.720 --> 00:34:39.120]   because we don't hear about Joseph after Jesus' childhood.
[00:34:39.120 --> 00:34:43.020]   So most scholars believe that Joseph probably died when Jesus was young,
[00:34:43.020 --> 00:34:44.920]   maybe as a teenager.
[00:34:44.920 --> 00:34:47.620]   And so as a result of that, being the firstborn,
[00:34:47.620 --> 00:34:51.120]   he was the breadwinner, he had to take care of the family.
[00:34:51.120 --> 00:34:55.120]   So his position in this family wasn't just a child and a mother.
[00:34:55.120 --> 00:34:56.920]   He was probably the head of the household.
[00:34:56.920 --> 00:35:02.020]   Now, considering all of that, considering he's come from Asian culture,
[00:35:02.020 --> 00:35:05.720]   where he is expected to take care of his brothers and his mom,
[00:35:05.720 --> 00:35:13.020]   who's been widowed, to say what he says here is beyond insensitive.
[00:35:13.020 --> 00:35:16.120]   It's irresponsible.
[00:35:16.120 --> 00:35:20.920]   And we're talking about this a week before Father's Day.
[00:35:20.920 --> 00:35:23.820]   So understand that that's the context in which it would have been.
[00:35:23.820 --> 00:35:30.120]   What Jesus is saying to a first-century Jew would have been very shocking.
[00:35:30.120 --> 00:35:32.620]   Even if it is shocking for us today, it would have been very shocking
[00:35:32.620 --> 00:35:34.820]   for the first generation, for that generation.
[00:35:34.820 --> 00:35:38.120]   But this is what he says, Matthew 10, 34-39.
[00:35:38.120 --> 00:35:40.020]   "Do not think that I came to bring peace on earth,
[00:35:40.020 --> 00:35:43.920]   but I did not come to bring peace but a sword.
[00:35:43.920 --> 00:35:47.220]   For I came to set a man against his father and a daughter against her mother
[00:35:47.220 --> 00:35:49.820]   and a daughter-in-law against her mother-in-law,
[00:35:49.820 --> 00:35:52.920]   and man's enemies will be the members of his household.
[00:35:52.920 --> 00:35:56.620]   He who loves father or mother more than me is not worthy of me,
[00:35:56.620 --> 00:36:01.620]   and he who loves his son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me."
[00:36:01.620 --> 00:36:04.220]   Now, again, in a Western culture, you may look at that and say,
[00:36:04.220 --> 00:36:06.220]   "Well, I don't have a problem with this, right?
[00:36:06.220 --> 00:36:08.920]   I don't like my mother-in-law anyway, right?
[00:36:08.920 --> 00:36:11.420]   I've had problems with my parents anyway, right?"
[00:36:11.420 --> 00:36:16.020]   In a Western culture, you're independent, you pay your own bills, you're an adult.
[00:36:16.020 --> 00:36:19.020]   You say this in an Asian culture, in that particular generation, say,
[00:36:19.020 --> 00:36:20.820]   "If you love your mother and father more than me,
[00:36:20.820 --> 00:36:24.820]   your son or daughter more than me, you are not worthy of me."
[00:36:24.820 --> 00:36:28.020]   This is a shocking statement that Jesus is saying.
[00:36:28.020 --> 00:36:29.420]   And then he follows it up by saying,
[00:36:29.420 --> 00:36:34.620]   "He who does not take his cross and follow after me is not worthy of me.
[00:36:34.620 --> 00:36:36.420]   He who has found his life will lose it,
[00:36:36.420 --> 00:36:40.520]   and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it."
[00:36:40.520 --> 00:36:43.520]   Now, we look at this text, and we know that passage well about lordship.
[00:36:43.520 --> 00:36:46.520]   That's the go-to text.
[00:36:46.520 --> 00:36:52.420]   "He who does not deny himself, pick up his cross, and follow me cannot be my disciple."
[00:36:52.420 --> 00:37:02.920]   But understand that that lordship text is stated after talking about
[00:37:02.920 --> 00:37:08.020]   the relationship with mother and father and to their children.
[00:37:08.020 --> 00:37:11.120]   So in the context, when he says, "You need to pick up your cross,"
[00:37:11.120 --> 00:37:15.520]   in the Western culture, we think, "You know what? I had this desire to become rich.
[00:37:15.520 --> 00:37:18.920]   I had this desire to have a big house. I had this desire.
[00:37:18.920 --> 00:37:22.720]   So I'm going to pick up my cross and deny myself."
[00:37:22.720 --> 00:37:29.120]   To a first-century Jew who was loyal to his heritage,
[00:37:29.120 --> 00:37:36.820]   his greatest temptation was to his parents and his own children.
[00:37:36.820 --> 00:37:39.720]   And in the context in which Jesus is speaking,
[00:37:39.720 --> 00:37:48.920]   he's talking to an Asian good son, a daughter who has made their life plan,
[00:37:48.920 --> 00:37:55.820]   life goal, first and foremost, to be a good son, to be a good daughter.
[00:37:55.820 --> 00:38:02.620]   He says, "He who finds his life will lose it, and he who has lost his life for my sake will find it."
[00:38:02.620 --> 00:38:06.920]   So first thing that he's trying to teach his disciples and the crowds that are coming
[00:38:06.920 --> 00:38:12.620]   is the supremacy of Christ, supremacy of God over all things.
[00:38:12.620 --> 00:38:16.420]   If you've ever traveled or if you've been actively trying to evangelize,
[00:38:16.420 --> 00:38:24.020]   one of the most common obstacles that you will face is loyalty to their family.
[00:38:24.020 --> 00:38:32.020]   In Japan, part of the reason why it's so hard to penetrate this country with the gospel
[00:38:32.020 --> 00:38:36.420]   is because their social ties to their family is so tight.
[00:38:36.420 --> 00:38:42.020]   By culture, they're not allowed to break out of what's acceptable.
[00:38:42.020 --> 00:38:49.320]   You may have heard this, the common saying in Japan is, "The nail that sticks out gets hammered first."
[00:38:49.320 --> 00:38:52.820]   So they don't like to break out of tradition.
[00:38:52.820 --> 00:38:57.620]   And so what's the most common objection to following Christ is,
[00:38:57.620 --> 00:39:03.020]   "If I make this decision, I will be shunned by my family.
[00:39:03.020 --> 00:39:07.920]   My father and my mother, my brothers and my sister, they will reject me.
[00:39:07.920 --> 00:39:14.820]   And if I do something to get rejected by them, they will be rejected by my grandparents."
[00:39:14.820 --> 00:39:23.220]   I've seen this over and over again, people who come from the Middle East, even in our culture.
[00:39:23.220 --> 00:39:26.920]   We have people who come and say, "I believe all of this, but I cannot make the final decision.
[00:39:26.920 --> 00:39:31.120]   I can come to Christ, I can do this, but I can't be baptized.
[00:39:31.120 --> 00:39:34.520]   My parents will allow me to go to church, but they won't allow me to be baptized
[00:39:34.520 --> 00:39:39.720]   because baptism means that you're just becoming a new person and we will not allow that."
[00:39:39.720 --> 00:39:47.720]   And so oftentimes we have to talk to people what Christ says here.
[00:39:47.720 --> 00:39:50.420]   Christ must be supreme.
[00:39:50.420 --> 00:39:57.720]   In India, so much of the opposition toward the gospel is that they will be shunned by their family,
[00:39:57.720 --> 00:40:02.120]   and then ultimately by the village, and then ultimately by the whole culture.
[00:40:02.120 --> 00:40:08.320]   And so Christ knew, not only his disciples, but the people who are following him in that culture,
[00:40:08.320 --> 00:40:14.420]   one of their biggest stumbling blocks is going to come from their own family.
[00:40:14.420 --> 00:40:21.220]   And Jesus is preparing his disciples for what is inevitably going to come.
[00:40:21.220 --> 00:40:28.220]   When we think about peace and safety in our generation, we think that if I follow Christ,
[00:40:28.220 --> 00:40:32.420]   and if I'm obedient, if I'm active at church, that God's going to answer my prayers,
[00:40:32.420 --> 00:40:35.620]   he's going to bless my family, we're going to have good health,
[00:40:35.620 --> 00:40:42.620]   my children are going to be taken care of, we're going to live a long life if I'm a good Christian.
[00:40:42.620 --> 00:40:46.120]   As long as I'm good, I'm a good father or a good mother,
[00:40:46.120 --> 00:40:52.020]   and I take care of my children, that all of these things are going to be good.
[00:40:52.020 --> 00:40:56.120]   But the text that we're looking at, Jesus says, he goes even further than that.
[00:40:56.120 --> 00:41:04.420]   In Luke chapter 14, he says, "He who does not hate his father and mother and wife more than me cannot be my disciple."
[00:41:04.420 --> 00:41:10.620]   The reason why Jesus is saying this is that the only way, one, that they're going to persevere
[00:41:10.620 --> 00:41:13.820]   is they recognize the supremacy of God.
[00:41:13.820 --> 00:41:21.820]   When God said, "Thou shalt worship no other gods before me," that includes your mom and dad and your children.
[00:41:21.820 --> 00:41:26.120]   That includes your mom and dad and your children, your husband, your wife.
[00:41:26.120 --> 00:41:32.420]   And the reason why is the only way that a child or mom or dad can be saved is God.
[00:41:32.420 --> 00:41:35.820]   The power is not in you, the power is not in me, it's in God.
[00:41:35.820 --> 00:41:43.420]   So unless Christ is supreme, he cannot demonstrate his power.
[00:41:43.420 --> 00:41:47.620]   Anybody who's been on a plane for any period of time, like even once,
[00:41:47.620 --> 00:41:52.920]   every single flight, even a 40-minute flight, that you're going somewhere nearby,
[00:41:52.920 --> 00:41:57.320]   they always will start by telling you, "We're going to give this presentation."
[00:41:57.320 --> 00:41:58.820]   And what's the first thing that they tell you?
[00:41:58.820 --> 00:42:04.720]   If something happens, that oxygen mask falls down, and what do they tell you?
[00:42:04.720 --> 00:42:07.520]   They tell you something really strange.
[00:42:07.520 --> 00:42:12.520]   They said, "When that thing comes down, don't worry about your kids.
[00:42:12.520 --> 00:42:15.720]   Don't worry about if you have aging parents that they can't reach this.
[00:42:15.720 --> 00:42:18.420]   You put that on first."
[00:42:18.420 --> 00:42:23.120]   Now, how many of you, when you hear that, say, "That is not right.
[00:42:23.120 --> 00:42:25.320]   I got a question.
[00:42:25.320 --> 00:42:27.420]   I got to honor my—I got to protect my kids.
[00:42:27.420 --> 00:42:29.420]   What do you mean put it on first?"
[00:42:29.420 --> 00:42:31.920]   You know exactly why.
[00:42:31.920 --> 00:42:34.520]   Why do they tell you to put it on first?
[00:42:34.520 --> 00:42:39.520]   Because if you don't put it on, and you might be the adult, you might be the healthy one,
[00:42:39.520 --> 00:42:43.220]   if you're not okay, you can't help them.
[00:42:43.220 --> 00:42:45.620]   So they're telling you, "Put the mask on.
[00:42:45.620 --> 00:42:52.520]   Make sure you're good so that you can take care of the others."
[00:42:52.520 --> 00:42:59.320]   So when Jesus says, "My mother and father, my brothers, sisters,"
[00:42:59.320 --> 00:43:01.620]   like, "These are my brothers and sisters,"
[00:43:01.620 --> 00:43:08.220]   he knows the greatest temptation, in particular this culture,
[00:43:08.220 --> 00:43:12.820]   is our loyalty to the people that we care about and love,
[00:43:12.820 --> 00:43:15.520]   that we can come this much, but we can't go further than that,
[00:43:15.520 --> 00:43:19.820]   because I love my mom, I love my dad, I love my children.
[00:43:19.820 --> 00:43:24.120]   Plenty of people who are genuine followers of Christ
[00:43:24.120 --> 00:43:29.020]   come all the way to the point and say, "I can sacrifice, but not my children.
[00:43:29.020 --> 00:43:35.520]   I can do this. Whatever you ask of me, I will do, but not my kids, not my wife."
[00:43:35.520 --> 00:43:40.420]   And as a result of that, we harden our hearts toward an area of our life.
[00:43:40.420 --> 00:43:43.620]   "I will open every other door, but except this door,"
[00:43:43.620 --> 00:43:49.120]   not realizing that that door closes all the other doors.
[00:43:49.120 --> 00:43:52.720]   And the Scripture says that you have become hard of hearing,
[00:43:52.720 --> 00:43:55.620]   and the reason why is because the Word of God no longer penetrates,
[00:43:55.620 --> 00:43:57.420]   because we've hardened our heart.
[00:43:57.420 --> 00:44:00.620]   This, "I will not give up."
[00:44:00.620 --> 00:44:05.420]   Or somehow we've convinced ourselves that obeying God means to be a good mother,
[00:44:05.420 --> 00:44:07.220]   and that's it.
[00:44:07.220 --> 00:44:09.220]   Obeying God means to be a good father, and that's it.
[00:44:09.220 --> 00:44:13.320]   As long as I'm a good husband, as long as happy wife, happy life.
[00:44:13.320 --> 00:44:15.720]   Heresy.
[00:44:15.720 --> 00:44:20.720]   That's a description of the fall of man.
[00:44:20.720 --> 00:44:24.720]   If your wife is happy because you're living in compromise,
[00:44:24.720 --> 00:44:28.020]   you need to fight against that.
[00:44:28.020 --> 00:44:32.120]   Jesus knew that the greatest temptation for his disciples
[00:44:32.120 --> 00:44:36.320]   was not going to come from the Pharisees, was not going to come from materialism.
[00:44:36.320 --> 00:44:40.220]   It was going to come from their own family.
[00:44:40.220 --> 00:44:45.420]   Luke 9, 59-62, and he said to Jesus, talking about discipleship, he says,
[00:44:45.420 --> 00:44:51.120]   "Follow me," but he said, "Lord, permit me to first go and bury my father."
[00:44:51.120 --> 00:44:55.220]   Again, that would be a great title for Father's Day sermon.
[00:44:55.220 --> 00:44:56.620]   Maybe I'll just save that for later.
[00:44:56.620 --> 00:45:00.020]   Say, "Take care of your father first. Honor your father."
[00:45:00.020 --> 00:45:02.820]   Except, he says in verse 60, but he said to him,
[00:45:02.820 --> 00:45:04.520]   "Allow the dead to bury their own dead,
[00:45:04.520 --> 00:45:08.820]   but as for you, go and proclaim everywhere the kingdom of God."
[00:45:08.820 --> 00:45:11.820]   Did he actually say that? Yeah, that's what he said.
[00:45:11.820 --> 00:45:13.920]   Another also said, "I will follow you, Lord,
[00:45:13.920 --> 00:45:16.920]   but first permit me to say goodbye to those at home."
[00:45:16.920 --> 00:45:20.120]   But Jesus said to him, "No one, after putting his hand to the plow
[00:45:20.120 --> 00:45:24.720]   and looking back, is fit for the kingdom of God."
[00:45:24.720 --> 00:45:30.320]   Jesus, first and foremost, is teaching the supremacy of God above all things.
[00:45:30.320 --> 00:45:33.020]   Of course, he's not saying that you can't honor them.
[00:45:33.020 --> 00:45:37.420]   He says we have to honor them. We have to obey them.
[00:45:37.420 --> 00:45:40.720]   But he's telling them this because he knows.
[00:45:40.720 --> 00:45:44.820]   He knows that this is going to be their downfall.
[00:45:44.820 --> 00:45:47.520]   That this is what is going to cause them to compromise.
[00:45:47.520 --> 00:45:51.720]   This is what's going to cause them to have selective hearing.
[00:45:51.720 --> 00:45:59.920]   That their obedience to God is going to be pigeon-held into what I can and cannot obey.
[00:45:59.920 --> 00:46:04.420]   What I am willing and unwilling to do. I am willing to sacrifice my own life,
[00:46:04.420 --> 00:46:10.820]   but not my kids. Not my parents. Not the ones that I love.
[00:46:10.820 --> 00:46:15.420]   And as a result of that, we stiff-arm God.
[00:46:15.420 --> 00:46:17.220]   We convince ourselves that's not what we're doing
[00:46:17.220 --> 00:46:20.520]   because I'm just trying to be a good dad.
[00:46:20.520 --> 00:46:24.120]   I'm just trying to be a good mother.
[00:46:24.120 --> 00:46:29.520]   I remember when my kids were younger, especially when I had my firstborn.
[00:46:29.520 --> 00:46:34.020]   You know, I made a sacrifice. I said, "You know what? I'm not going to pursue money.
[00:46:34.020 --> 00:46:35.420]   I'm going to do homeless ministry."
[00:46:35.420 --> 00:46:41.720]   And I was prepared for whatever was coming down until I had my kid.
[00:46:41.720 --> 00:46:45.620]   And I remember driving around in a pickup truck with no air conditioning
[00:46:45.620 --> 00:46:49.620]   and having an infant in my car in the front seat. No back seat, just the front seat.
[00:46:49.620 --> 00:46:51.720]   And I remember every time I had to put him in the car,
[00:46:51.720 --> 00:46:56.220]   he would end up with a rash on his back because of sweat coming down his back.
[00:46:56.220 --> 00:47:02.320]   For the first time after committing my life to be a pastor,
[00:47:02.320 --> 00:47:05.420]   I started being tempted for money.
[00:47:05.420 --> 00:47:09.420]   And I wasn't trying to buy a big house. I wasn't trying to get rich.
[00:47:09.420 --> 00:47:12.820]   I just wanted enough money so I can buy a car with air conditioning
[00:47:12.820 --> 00:47:18.120]   so my son doesn't have to break out in rash every time I put him in the car.
[00:47:18.120 --> 00:47:21.620]   And I remember first time thinking, "Maybe I can do something else.
[00:47:21.620 --> 00:47:25.720]   Maybe I can get a side job. Maybe I can go to a bigger church."
[00:47:25.720 --> 00:47:31.120]   And I remember when those thoughts begin to creep in that this is the beginning of the temptation.
[00:47:31.120 --> 00:47:36.120]   And it was for good reason. I just wanted to be a good dad.
[00:47:36.120 --> 00:47:39.620]   I just wanted to be a good dad.
[00:47:39.620 --> 00:47:46.120]   Jesus knows that his disciples are going to be tempted with this.
[00:47:46.120 --> 00:47:50.120]   That the things that they are the most loyal to, the people that they love the most,
[00:47:50.120 --> 00:47:56.420]   is going to be the source of the greatest temptation for them.
[00:47:56.420 --> 00:48:01.820]   The second point in this, he says, the identifying mark of this.
[00:48:01.820 --> 00:48:07.320]   If Christ has to have supremacy over all things,
[00:48:07.320 --> 00:48:09.920]   he says this new family, what is this new family?
[00:48:09.920 --> 00:48:12.720]   Luke 8.21 says, "He answered and said to them,
[00:48:12.720 --> 00:48:19.120]   'My mother and my brothers are these who hear the word of God and do it.'"
[00:48:19.120 --> 00:48:25.320]   So it's clear that the new family that we have in Christ, we call the church, Ekklesia.
[00:48:25.320 --> 00:48:31.420]   But the very meaning of the word Ekklesia, it means the gathering of called out ones.
[00:48:31.420 --> 00:48:35.920]   That's a literal meaning of the word Ekklesia.
[00:48:35.920 --> 00:48:39.520]   Gathering of called out ones. So what does that mean?
[00:48:39.520 --> 00:48:41.820]   It's not just a gathering. It's not just any gathering.
[00:48:41.820 --> 00:48:47.220]   Gathering of called out ones. Called out from what?
[00:48:47.220 --> 00:48:53.020]   Called out from your old life. Called out from your old loyalties.
[00:48:53.020 --> 00:48:57.420]   Called out from the old rat race. Called out where he says,
[00:48:57.420 --> 00:49:04.420]   "Come to Christ who is outside the camp, that we may join him to go outside the camp."
[00:49:04.420 --> 00:49:12.220]   So the very definition of a church is a gathering of called out people.
[00:49:12.220 --> 00:49:18.020]   Jesus says in John 3, 5-6, to Nicodemus, "Jesus answered, 'Truly, truly, I say to you,
[00:49:18.020 --> 00:49:22.620]   unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter the kingdom of God.
[00:49:22.620 --> 00:49:26.320]   That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.'"
[00:49:26.320 --> 00:49:31.520]   Now some people have debated that the water here he's referring to is baptism.
[00:49:31.520 --> 00:49:33.720]   I don't think it's baptism. In my opinion,
[00:49:33.720 --> 00:49:37.020]   I think he's just talking about somebody who's born in the flesh
[00:49:37.020 --> 00:49:40.720]   versus somebody who's a Christian who's born in the Spirit.
[00:49:40.720 --> 00:49:44.320]   He says, "That which is born of water." Somebody who's born, the water breaks,
[00:49:44.320 --> 00:49:50.420]   and then he is born physically. So you may be physically born as a Jew,
[00:49:50.420 --> 00:49:54.320]   tribe of Benjamin. He said, "But you're of the flesh."
[00:49:54.320 --> 00:49:57.120]   But the people in the kingdom of God are not only born of water,
[00:49:57.120 --> 00:50:01.220]   but they are also born of Spirit. That which is born of the flesh is flesh,
[00:50:01.220 --> 00:50:04.620]   and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.
[00:50:04.620 --> 00:50:12.020]   So the family of God are people who have been called out and are born again.
[00:50:12.020 --> 00:50:14.820]   So the family of God isn't just simply because you became a member
[00:50:14.820 --> 00:50:18.220]   or that you're at the church or you're serving the church.
[00:50:18.220 --> 00:50:21.320]   He says, "The identifying mark of a genuine believer,
[00:50:21.320 --> 00:50:25.220]   a new family in Christ, is the Holy Spirit, that we have been born again.
[00:50:25.220 --> 00:50:29.520]   We have been called out from our old loyalty to Christ,
[00:50:29.520 --> 00:50:32.020]   who is supreme over all things." Ephesians 2:19.
[00:50:32.020 --> 00:50:34.020]   So then you are no longer strangers and aliens,
[00:50:34.020 --> 00:50:39.720]   but you are fellow citizens with the saints and are of God's household.
[00:50:39.720 --> 00:50:46.320]   Now we are in God's family. In fact, that's a language that's used in 1 Timothy 5, 1 and 2,
[00:50:46.320 --> 00:50:49.120]   referring to us and how we ought to relate to one another.
[00:50:49.120 --> 00:50:55.620]   And he says, "Do not sharply rebuke an older man, but rather appeal to him as a father,
[00:50:55.620 --> 00:50:59.120]   and to the younger men as brothers, to the older women as mothers,
[00:50:59.120 --> 00:51:02.120]   and the younger women as sisters in all purity." In other words,
[00:51:02.120 --> 00:51:07.520]   he uses that language of a family, that now this is our family.
[00:51:07.520 --> 00:51:12.520]   This is a gathering of called-out people who have put aside their old loyalty
[00:51:12.520 --> 00:51:18.120]   and that now because of our loyalty to God, now you and I have become a family.
[00:51:18.120 --> 00:51:27.420]   Older men as fathers, older women as mothers, younger as our brothers and sisters, with all purity.
[00:51:27.420 --> 00:51:32.320]   He said this, born-again Christians in the Spirit,
[00:51:32.320 --> 00:51:38.620]   these are people not only who hear the Word, but he says those who obey the Word of God.
[00:51:38.620 --> 00:51:42.320]   Obey the Word of God. So just because you're in Bible study,
[00:51:42.320 --> 00:51:47.220]   just because you attend service on every Sunday, doesn't mean that we're family of God.
[00:51:47.220 --> 00:51:51.120]   People, if you've come from a church that doesn't practice membership,
[00:51:51.120 --> 00:51:55.420]   that you know, there's a sometimes there's like a violent reaction like, "Membership?
[00:51:55.420 --> 00:51:58.620]   You guys are exclusive. I thought the Kingdom of God is open to everybody.
[00:51:58.620 --> 00:52:03.120]   I thought we're gracious to everybody." If you read the Scriptures carefully,
[00:52:03.120 --> 00:52:11.720]   the criteria for membership of the church is much more stringent than anything that you will experience here.
[00:52:11.720 --> 00:52:14.520]   The entrance into the Kingdom of God, the criteria for the Kingdom of God,
[00:52:14.520 --> 00:52:18.820]   yes, it is by the grace of God, but he says it's not those who hear,
[00:52:18.820 --> 00:52:23.120]   it's those who obey the Word of God. You need to obey.
[00:52:23.120 --> 00:52:27.020]   You know, we have tenfold covenant in our church that we're asking you to follow.
[00:52:27.020 --> 00:52:31.720]   It's basically basic Christianity what we have.
[00:52:31.720 --> 00:52:39.420]   But what the Bible requires for membership in the family of God is much more stringent.
[00:52:39.420 --> 00:52:43.620]   And so he says in John 8, 31, 32, listen to this carefully.
[00:52:43.620 --> 00:52:49.620]   Jesus was saying to those Jews who had believed him, right, who had believed him,
[00:52:49.620 --> 00:52:53.920]   "If you continue in my Word, then you are truly my disciples of mine,
[00:52:53.920 --> 00:52:57.620]   and you will know the truth, and the truth will make you free."
[00:52:57.620 --> 00:53:05.020]   Now again, remember, he's talking to Jews who had believed, and he says, "If you continue,"
[00:53:05.020 --> 00:53:08.520]   and the word "continue" here means to obey.
[00:53:08.520 --> 00:53:14.520]   "If you obey my Word, then you are disciples," not simply somebody who raised their hand,
[00:53:14.520 --> 00:53:17.620]   not somebody who says, "You know what? I want to accept that for myself.
[00:53:17.620 --> 00:53:24.620]   I want to give him a try," but he says, "He who hears my words and obeys my Word are my disciples."
[00:53:24.620 --> 00:53:28.220]   Now I don't have the verses up here, but as soon as they hear that, they get offended.
[00:53:28.220 --> 00:53:33.420]   Set free? They prided themselves of being free.
[00:53:33.420 --> 00:53:35.720]   "We're children of Abraham. We've never been slaves.
[00:53:35.720 --> 00:53:38.920]   How dare you call us and tell us that we need to be free?"
[00:53:38.920 --> 00:53:43.220]   They go back and forth, back and forth, and Jesus says in John 8, 44,
[00:53:43.220 --> 00:53:48.020]   "You do not understand what I'm saying because your father is the devil."
[00:53:48.020 --> 00:53:56.720]   And he's talking to people who John says believed, and then he says, "Your father's the devil."
[00:53:56.720 --> 00:54:02.020]   Ephesians 2, 8 through 10, isn't it salvation by grace? Of course it's by grace.
[00:54:02.020 --> 00:54:06.020]   The Bible says it's by grace. It says, "For by grace you have been saved through faith,
[00:54:06.020 --> 00:54:10.720]   and that not of yourselves. It is the gift of God, not as a result of works, so that no one may boast."
[00:54:10.720 --> 00:54:13.320]   Right? We all know that passage. We memorize that passage.
[00:54:13.320 --> 00:54:16.720]   Some of you grew up in the church sang that passage.
[00:54:16.720 --> 00:54:21.320]   We're by grace, not by works.
[00:54:21.320 --> 00:54:24.520]   But we should also sing the second part, which says, "For we are his workmanship,
[00:54:24.520 --> 00:54:28.320]   created in Christ Jesus for good works."
[00:54:28.320 --> 00:54:34.420]   He says, "The reason why you're saved by grace is so that you may have good works,
[00:54:34.420 --> 00:54:40.020]   that he may restore us, that we may live the righteous life that he had called us to live,
[00:54:40.020 --> 00:54:43.720]   that we could not live because of our sins."
[00:54:43.720 --> 00:54:47.720]   So grace frees us from the penalty of sin,
[00:54:47.720 --> 00:54:51.520]   but the grace of God also frees us from the power of sin,
[00:54:51.520 --> 00:54:57.120]   so that we may live reflecting his glory.
[00:54:57.120 --> 00:55:01.420]   It's just like somebody who's been trying to get on the tennis team all his life,
[00:55:01.420 --> 00:55:04.720]   and they're just not good at the backswing.
[00:55:04.720 --> 00:55:09.420]   And all of a sudden they go on the basketball court, and he jumps 55 inches.
[00:55:09.420 --> 00:55:12.220]   And he just cannot miss.
[00:55:12.220 --> 00:55:17.920]   And he wakes up and realizes, "Oh, this is much better fitting."
[00:55:17.920 --> 00:55:22.020]   This is what I was made for. I was made to dunk over people.
[00:55:22.020 --> 00:55:25.820]   You know what I mean? I was made for highlights.
[00:55:25.820 --> 00:55:30.820]   The Bible tells us that you and I have been created for righteousness.
[00:55:30.820 --> 00:55:37.320]   So a professing Christian who is living in perpetual disobedience is a miserable individual,
[00:55:37.320 --> 00:55:43.320]   because his expectations and his life does not match.
[00:55:43.320 --> 00:55:47.220]   Because he is miserable. He feels disconnected in the church.
[00:55:47.220 --> 00:55:52.720]   He doesn't have fellowship in the church, while he is living in disobedience.
[00:55:52.720 --> 00:55:57.820]   And he thinks that his disconnection with the church is because people are not nice to him,
[00:55:57.820 --> 00:56:00.920]   that people are not reaching out to him. That's why they feel disconnected.
[00:56:00.920 --> 00:56:06.520]   But the fundamental disconnection is that you're in a place where you don't belong,
[00:56:06.520 --> 00:56:11.120]   where you have openly said, "I'm not going to follow Christ in my life."
[00:56:11.120 --> 00:56:15.320]   It's like somebody with a USC jersey goes into the UCLA locker room and says,
[00:56:15.320 --> 00:56:18.420]   "How come nobody cares about me here?"
[00:56:18.420 --> 00:56:21.920]   You're in the wrong locker room. You need to go to USC.
[00:56:21.920 --> 00:56:25.720]   Or you need to change your loyalty.
[00:56:25.720 --> 00:56:33.320]   You're wanting to be accepted, loved, be a part of a community wearing the wrong jersey.
[00:56:33.320 --> 00:56:37.920]   Now, if you say that you're not a Christian, understandable.
[00:56:37.920 --> 00:56:41.320]   "I have a USC, but I'm kind of questioning my jersey.
[00:56:41.320 --> 00:56:46.620]   Their team hasn't been good for a while, and I want to experience this new life at UCLA."
[00:56:46.620 --> 00:56:51.220]   And so you're there kind of like taken off, and you're just kind of curious, and you're looking.
[00:56:51.220 --> 00:56:54.120]   And UCLA is doing their best to kind of recruit you to that.
[00:56:54.120 --> 00:56:59.220]   But you're coming in there with a USC, and it's like, "How come nobody accepts me here?
[00:56:59.220 --> 00:57:01.420]   Why can't I be a part of this team?
[00:57:01.420 --> 00:57:07.820]   Why can't I wear this jersey and play football for UCLA?"
[00:57:07.820 --> 00:57:10.020]   You're in the wrong place.
[00:57:10.020 --> 00:57:15.320]   The most miserable person in the church is somebody who claims to be a Christian
[00:57:15.320 --> 00:57:19.520]   and living perpetually in disobedience.
[00:57:19.520 --> 00:57:27.320]   See, your mother, your father, your son, your daughter are those who says who hear and who obey.
[00:57:27.320 --> 00:57:33.620]   John 8, Ephesians 2, 8, 9, it says, "Created for good works which God prepared beforehand
[00:57:33.620 --> 00:57:35.920]   so that you would walk in him."
[00:57:35.920 --> 00:57:42.620]   A genuine child of God only finds true rest and happiness when he is living righteously
[00:57:42.620 --> 00:57:44.820]   because that's what you were created to do.
[00:57:44.820 --> 00:57:47.220]   That's why you are saved by grace.
[00:57:47.220 --> 00:57:50.920]   That's why grace covered by the blood of Christ opened the door
[00:57:50.920 --> 00:57:55.320]   so that you may live what God intended you to live.
[00:57:55.320 --> 00:58:01.120]   So a Christian, professing Christian who's living in disobedience is a miserable individual.
[00:58:01.120 --> 00:58:06.520]   And you can blame the context, you can blame the people, you can blame the leadership,
[00:58:06.520 --> 00:58:13.720]   but at the core of it, you're walking in contradiction to your own confession.
[00:58:13.720 --> 00:58:16.820]   Now, that doesn't mean a Christian doesn't struggle at times.
[00:58:16.820 --> 00:58:20.120]   That doesn't mean a Christian sometimes wrestles with sin.
[00:58:20.120 --> 00:58:23.220]   But there's a huge difference, according to 1 John 1 and 2,
[00:58:23.220 --> 00:58:27.520]   between somebody who is living in sin and somebody who is struggling in sin.
[00:58:27.520 --> 00:58:31.520]   God is patient with Christians who are struggling,
[00:58:31.520 --> 00:58:35.320]   wanting accountability, wanting to grow, but are struggling in an area
[00:58:35.320 --> 00:58:39.720]   versus an individual who has accepted his sin.
[00:58:39.720 --> 00:58:42.020]   Don't judge me. Who are you to judge me?
[00:58:42.020 --> 00:58:44.720]   I'm going to keep this jersey on.
[00:58:44.720 --> 00:58:49.020]   I'm going to keep this jersey on. I have no intention of taking off this jersey.
[00:58:49.020 --> 00:58:52.420]   And you need to accept me as I am.
[00:58:52.420 --> 00:58:59.320]   Salvation is by grace alone, but saving grace is never alone.
[00:58:59.320 --> 00:59:02.520]   That was a mantra of the Reformers.
[00:59:02.520 --> 00:59:06.120]   As they taught salvation is by grace alone,
[00:59:06.120 --> 00:59:09.520]   they were concerned that people are going to be confused.
[00:59:09.520 --> 00:59:13.520]   That it doesn't mean salvation by grace doesn't make—well, God saved you.
[00:59:13.520 --> 00:59:16.420]   Now you can do whatever you want. Since now you have the ticket to heaven,
[00:59:16.420 --> 00:59:19.220]   some of them are going to be obedient, some of them are going to be disobedient,
[00:59:19.220 --> 00:59:24.220]   some of them are going to follow Christ, some people aren't even going to attend church.
[00:59:24.220 --> 00:59:27.720]   But now that I have a ticket, I just may not be in the front line,
[00:59:27.720 --> 00:59:32.820]   but I have a ticket to get in. They were concerned that people are going to think that,
[00:59:32.820 --> 00:59:38.720]   and that's why they said, "He who does not have the church as his mother
[00:59:38.720 --> 00:59:44.420]   cannot have God as his father." And they were saying the same thing.
[00:59:44.420 --> 00:59:49.120]   Not simply those who hear, but those who obey the Word of God.
[00:59:49.120 --> 00:59:52.420]   James chapter 2, 1 John 2, 3 to 6.
[00:59:52.420 --> 00:59:57.120]   "By this we know that we have come to know him, if we keep his commandments."
[00:59:57.120 --> 01:00:00.120]   That's how we know, he says. The one who says, "I have come to know him,"
[01:00:00.120 --> 01:00:05.020]   and does not keep his commandment, is a liar. Right?
[01:00:05.020 --> 01:00:07.620]   And the truth is not in him.
[01:00:07.620 --> 01:00:11.020]   But whoever keeps his word in him, the love of God has truly been perfected.
[01:00:11.020 --> 01:00:14.620]   By this we know that we are in him. The one who says he abides in him
[01:00:14.620 --> 01:00:20.420]   ought himself to walk in the same manner as he walked.
[01:00:20.420 --> 01:00:25.620]   Now, if I just said this, and I didn't quote the verse,
[01:00:25.620 --> 01:00:30.120]   so many people would be offended.
[01:00:30.120 --> 01:00:32.520]   By this you know, if you obey his commandments.
[01:00:32.520 --> 01:00:35.320]   If you don't obey his commandments, and you say that you're a Christian,
[01:00:35.320 --> 01:00:37.920]   you are a liar. The truth is not in you.
[01:00:37.920 --> 01:00:41.920]   Now, if I said that, and I didn't actually tell you where it came from,
[01:00:41.920 --> 01:00:46.220]   I bet you many of you would be like, "What kind of a preacher is this?
[01:00:46.220 --> 01:00:48.920]   He's so judgmental."
[01:00:48.920 --> 01:00:52.620]   But I just read you a text from the Bible.
[01:00:52.620 --> 01:00:56.020]   And this is not the only text. James chapter 2, 17-20.
[01:00:56.020 --> 01:01:00.520]   "Even so, faith, if it has no works, is dead, being by itself.
[01:01:00.520 --> 01:01:03.020]   But someone may well say, 'You have faith, and I have works.
[01:01:03.020 --> 01:01:06.720]   Show me your faith without the works, and I will show you my faith by my works.'"
[01:01:06.720 --> 01:01:09.220]   He's not saying that you're going to be saved by works,
[01:01:09.220 --> 01:01:15.620]   but you're the proof of genuine faith. It was proven by your works.
[01:01:15.620 --> 01:01:19.620]   You believe that God is one, you do well. The demons also believe that, and they shudder.
[01:01:19.620 --> 01:01:23.920]   You know who recognized the identity of Jesus first, before anybody else?
[01:01:23.920 --> 01:01:26.220]   The demons did.
[01:01:26.220 --> 01:01:31.220]   When they saw him, they said, "Son of God, have you come before your time to torture us?"
[01:01:31.220 --> 01:01:37.520]   And they fell on their knees, because they recognized who he was.
[01:01:37.520 --> 01:01:42.520]   And he says, "Yet they believed, but they didn't obey, they didn't surrender, they didn't repent."
[01:01:42.520 --> 01:01:48.620]   And he says, "A professing Christian, who have never repented, is like the demons.
[01:01:48.620 --> 01:01:54.520]   They know the truth, but they have not been set free."
[01:01:54.520 --> 01:01:58.020]   He says, "If you believe that God is one, you do well. The demons also believe and shudder.
[01:01:58.020 --> 01:02:05.520]   But are you willing to recognize, you foolish fellow, that faith without works is useless?"
[01:02:05.520 --> 01:02:09.120]   Faith without works is useless.
[01:02:09.120 --> 01:02:15.720]   If you profess to know God, and you are clinging to everything that you knew before you met Christ,
[01:02:15.720 --> 01:02:19.020]   you've never repented.
[01:02:19.020 --> 01:02:24.020]   And if you've never repented, it means you've never been forgiven.
[01:02:24.020 --> 01:02:31.420]   If you have your old life, and all you did was add Christ to your old life, you've never repented.
[01:02:31.420 --> 01:02:35.920]   So therefore, you've never been forgiven.
[01:02:35.920 --> 01:02:38.020]   I'm telling you what the Scripture says.
[01:02:38.020 --> 01:02:50.420]   As fundamental and as basic as this is, this message will keep away many, many professing Christians.
[01:02:50.420 --> 01:02:54.520]   And I'm just telling you what the Bible says.
[01:02:54.520 --> 01:03:02.820]   "He who hears my words and obeys my word, they are my mother. They are my brothers."
[01:03:02.820 --> 01:03:05.520]   How do you get more clear than that?
[01:03:05.520 --> 01:03:11.320]   And that's why, if you see the preaching of the early church, you never hear the preaching and say,
[01:03:11.320 --> 01:03:16.520]   "You know, this is what Jesus has done for you. He loves you. You don't have a purpose. He's going to give you a purpose.
[01:03:16.520 --> 01:03:20.820]   Would you receive the baptism of acceptance?"
[01:03:20.820 --> 01:03:28.320]   No. They didn't proclaim the baptism of acceptance. They proclaimed the baptism of repentance.
[01:03:28.320 --> 01:03:33.520]   Peter says in his first sermon, "Repent, each of you. Be baptized in the name of Jesus Christ."
[01:03:33.520 --> 01:03:37.620]   Acts 3.19, "Therefore, repent and return.
[01:03:37.620 --> 01:03:44.120]   You've gone astray. Now turn your life around and come to Christ, so that your sins may be wiped away."
[01:03:44.120 --> 01:03:48.120]   Paul says in Acts 17.30, "Therefore, having overlooked the times of ignorance,
[01:03:48.120 --> 01:03:52.720]   God has now declared to men that all people everywhere should repent."
[01:03:52.720 --> 01:03:58.520]   As he is going to Jerusalem, knowing that he's going to be captured, possibly die,
[01:03:58.520 --> 01:04:03.220]   and he's reiterating his message to the elders of the church of Ephesus,
[01:04:03.220 --> 01:04:10.820]   he says, "Solemnly testifying to both Jews and Greeks of repentance toward God and faith in our Lord Jesus Christ."
[01:04:10.820 --> 01:04:17.220]   Receive the baptism of repentance, not baptism of acceptance.
[01:04:17.220 --> 01:04:20.920]   I accept Jesus. I accept Jesus.
[01:04:20.920 --> 01:04:24.420]   Nowhere in the Bible does it say, "Can you please accept Jesus?"
[01:04:24.420 --> 01:04:29.020]   No, he says, "No. Sinners have offended a holy God."
[01:04:29.020 --> 01:04:34.720]   And God is gracious, not wanting us to perish, that He's been patient.
[01:04:34.720 --> 01:04:41.020]   And this is the only reason why He hasn't returned yet, because He's being patient with sinners,
[01:04:41.020 --> 01:04:46.420]   that in time, that others may also repent and come to Him.
[01:04:46.420 --> 01:04:53.420]   It's a baptism of repentance, not baptism of acceptance.
[01:04:53.420 --> 01:04:56.220]   So why is he saying this? Let me reiterate, as we wrap up.
[01:04:56.220 --> 01:05:03.720]   One, supremacy of Christ above all things.
[01:05:03.720 --> 01:05:13.620]   If you want to save your mother, your father, your children, put Christ first.
[01:05:13.620 --> 01:05:20.020]   Put Christ first. Put Christ first.
[01:05:20.020 --> 01:05:24.720]   You do not have the power to convince your loved ones.
[01:05:24.720 --> 01:05:29.220]   You do not have the power to convince even your own children.
[01:05:29.220 --> 01:05:37.120]   Only when Christ is sitting on the throne in your life, not a sub-throne, not an additional throne,
[01:05:37.120 --> 01:05:43.420]   but the only throne that only one person can sit in, only when Christ is sitting on that throne,
[01:05:43.420 --> 01:05:47.320]   will you be able to see His power at work.
[01:05:47.320 --> 01:05:51.320]   So put Christ first.
[01:05:51.320 --> 01:05:55.220]   "Seek ye first the kingdom of God, and all these things shall be added unto you."
[01:05:55.220 --> 01:05:59.120]   But second, he's preparing his disciples.
[01:05:59.120 --> 01:06:03.720]   He says, "The greatest temptation in their life is going to come through people that they love."
[01:06:03.720 --> 01:06:08.820]   Remember James and John? They sacrificed everything to follow Christ.
[01:06:08.820 --> 01:06:12.020]   And their mother was following with them, and she was there at the crucifixion.
[01:06:12.020 --> 01:06:15.320]   She was there at the resurrection.
[01:06:15.320 --> 01:06:19.620]   And as they were following, she was talking to their sons and saying,
[01:06:19.620 --> 01:06:23.920]   "Hey, you know, it's great that you're following Jesus, but make sure you're going to get something out of it.
[01:06:23.920 --> 01:06:26.120]   Make sure that you're going to sit on your left or to the right."
[01:06:26.120 --> 01:06:30.020]   You know, it sounds just like an Asian mom.
[01:06:30.020 --> 01:06:37.920]   That sounds like a tiger mom. "Go, go tell him. Forget it, let me go talk to him directly."
[01:06:37.920 --> 01:06:41.420]   It sounds exactly like a tiger mom.
[01:06:41.420 --> 01:06:46.020]   He was warning the disciples, "Your greatest stumbling, greatest temptation is going to come
[01:06:46.020 --> 01:06:50.620]   in the context of the people that you love dearly."
[01:06:50.620 --> 01:06:56.220]   Remember Peter? As Jesus is headed toward the cross, he loved Jesus.
[01:06:56.220 --> 01:07:02.420]   And when he said, "Even if everybody abandons you, I will not abandon you. I will die for you, Jesus."
[01:07:02.420 --> 01:07:05.220]   And I think he fully meant it.
[01:07:05.220 --> 01:07:08.120]   Because when the soldiers came, he was the only one who took out the knife.
[01:07:08.120 --> 01:07:10.920]   How come the other disciples didn't do that?
[01:07:10.920 --> 01:07:15.720]   They came with swords to capture one man, and Peter was the only one who took out the knife.
[01:07:15.720 --> 01:07:18.420]   He was ready to go.
[01:07:18.420 --> 01:07:22.920]   Jesus didn't look at Peter and say, "Peter, your loyalty is going to be rewarded.
[01:07:22.920 --> 01:07:26.620]   Well done, my good and faithful servant." Is that what he said?
[01:07:26.620 --> 01:07:30.620]   He said, "No, get behind me, Satan."
[01:07:30.620 --> 01:07:36.520]   Because Satan is using your love for me to try to hinder me to go to the cross.
[01:07:36.520 --> 01:07:41.520]   Satan is using your loyalty to me to prevent me from going to the cross.
[01:07:41.520 --> 01:07:44.620]   He said, "Get behind me, Satan."
[01:07:44.620 --> 01:07:48.620]   The greatest stumbling block to most people.
[01:07:48.620 --> 01:07:53.720]   And he knew it was going to go to his disciples. He knew.
[01:07:53.720 --> 01:07:57.520]   He was preparing his own family.
[01:07:57.520 --> 01:08:01.620]   Because he's about two years away from the cross.
[01:08:01.620 --> 01:08:04.320]   He was about two years away, and he knew.
[01:08:04.320 --> 01:08:07.320]   He's the head of the household, and they're depending on him.
[01:08:07.320 --> 01:08:10.520]   Initially, they rejected him.
[01:08:10.520 --> 01:08:13.320]   "You're doing all of this stuff. Why don't you go?"
[01:08:13.320 --> 01:08:16.120]   And Jesus says, "A prophet is not welcomed in his own home."
[01:08:16.120 --> 01:08:18.620]   His own family rejected him, didn't understand him.
[01:08:18.620 --> 01:08:23.020]   But now that he's gaining fame, his family is starting to show up into the crowd.
[01:08:23.020 --> 01:08:28.120]   "Where is Jesus?" And he's not only warning his disciples to protect them,
[01:08:28.120 --> 01:08:31.720]   he's preparing his own family.
[01:08:31.720 --> 01:08:35.520]   He's not going to be able to be that person for long.
[01:08:35.520 --> 01:08:37.720]   In two more years, he has to go to the Father.
[01:08:37.720 --> 01:08:40.920]   He's going to be crucified, and they're going to go through tremendous pain.
[01:08:40.920 --> 01:08:44.620]   And remember when Jesus was hanging on the cross,
[01:08:44.620 --> 01:08:48.120]   one of the last words that he says, he looks at Apostle John and says,
[01:08:48.120 --> 01:08:53.320]   "Take care of my mother. Take care of my mother."
[01:08:53.320 --> 01:08:55.720]   Jesus was not being insensitive.
[01:08:55.720 --> 01:09:00.020]   Jesus knew exactly where their weak point was.
[01:09:00.020 --> 01:09:07.420]   If you're a mother or father, every mother and father's weak point is their children.
[01:09:07.420 --> 01:09:09.520]   Is their children.
[01:09:09.520 --> 01:09:12.820]   "I will follow Christ, and I will give my life. I will sacrifice.
[01:09:12.820 --> 01:09:18.420]   I will be home. I can do it, but not my kids. Not my kids."
[01:09:18.420 --> 01:09:22.220]   And so we live all our lives protecting, providing.
[01:09:22.220 --> 01:09:26.120]   And we've given up finances for ourselves, but not for our kids.
[01:09:26.120 --> 01:09:31.020]   And all the fears and all the temptations that we gave up to follow Christ,
[01:09:31.020 --> 01:09:36.220]   all of a sudden, it resurfaces when we have children.
[01:09:36.220 --> 01:09:39.920]   I want to sacrifice for them. I want to take the bullet.
[01:09:39.920 --> 01:09:45.820]   But for my kids, I want them to be taken care of, be safe, provided for.
[01:09:45.820 --> 01:09:49.420]   I don't want them to miss out. I don't want them to be weird at school.
[01:09:49.420 --> 01:09:51.920]   I want them to be taken care of. I don't want them to pick up their cross.
[01:09:51.920 --> 01:09:55.420]   I'll pick up their cross.
[01:09:55.420 --> 01:10:02.920]   And if we're not married, our greatest temptation could be our own parents.
[01:10:02.920 --> 01:10:05.120]   I don't want to disappoint them.
[01:10:05.120 --> 01:10:07.820]   They lived a hard life. I want to provide for them.
[01:10:07.820 --> 01:10:11.420]   And it's coming from good intentions.
[01:10:11.420 --> 01:10:17.020]   But Jesus knows that very spot that you refuse to surrender to Christ
[01:10:17.020 --> 01:10:21.520]   is the very area where Satan will continue to attack.
[01:10:21.520 --> 01:10:23.920]   We'll never let you go.
[01:10:23.920 --> 01:10:28.420]   When we disobey, we never say, "No." We say, "Not now."
[01:10:28.420 --> 01:10:31.720]   Once this is taken care of, once my children are well,
[01:10:31.720 --> 01:10:34.520]   once my parents are well, then I will follow you.
[01:10:34.520 --> 01:10:39.220]   So disobedience never looks like, "No. It's not now."
[01:10:39.220 --> 01:10:42.020]   At another time, when at a different stage,
[01:10:42.020 --> 01:10:45.920]   when I've saved up enough money, when I've done this and I've done that.
[01:10:45.920 --> 01:10:54.720]   Not knowing that Satan is using that to keep you away from God.
[01:10:54.720 --> 01:10:57.020]   So when you understand the context of what Jesus is saying,
[01:10:57.020 --> 01:10:59.820]   He's not being insensitive to His family.
[01:10:59.820 --> 01:11:04.520]   He's establishing Christ the only answer.
[01:11:04.520 --> 01:11:09.320]   The only answer to all the problems of mankind.
[01:11:09.320 --> 01:11:12.920]   So seek ye first the kingdom of God,
[01:11:12.920 --> 01:11:16.120]   and all these other things shall be added unto you.
[01:11:16.120 --> 01:11:22.120]   Let's pray.
[01:11:22.120 --> 01:11:29.220]   Lord, we pray that Your Word, as difficult as it may be at times to apply,
[01:11:29.220 --> 01:11:33.720]   help us, Lord God, to trust in Your sovereign grace.
[01:11:33.720 --> 01:11:38.320]   That everything that You teach us, everything that You command of us,
[01:11:38.320 --> 01:11:43.620]   ultimately is for our life and the life of those that we love.
[01:11:43.620 --> 01:11:47.320]   Help us, Lord God, to surrender all things for the sake of Your name.
[01:11:47.320 --> 01:11:50.520]   Help us, Lord God, to know the sweet fellowship
[01:11:50.520 --> 01:11:56.320]   of being a part of a church who have been called out according to Your purpose.
[01:11:56.320 --> 01:12:01.620]   That we may be unified in one spirit, one love, one mind,
[01:12:01.620 --> 01:12:04.720]   to pursue You together as one family for the sake of Your glory.
[01:12:04.720 --> 01:12:07.220]   In Jesus' name we pray. Amen.
[01:12:07.220 --> 01:12:20.620]   Let's all stand up for the closing praise.
[01:12:20.620 --> 01:12:29.820]   We were ruined in our sin, we were guilty and undone,
[01:12:29.820 --> 01:12:39.120]   when Your love reached out with sovereign hands and beckoned us to come.
[01:12:39.120 --> 01:12:48.220]   You sought out the poor to live, made the rotten foes come home.
[01:12:48.220 --> 01:12:59.820]   With the lavish feast, You welcomed us, for You made us Your own.
[01:12:59.820 --> 01:13:09.020]   You have loved us like You loved Your Son.
[01:13:09.020 --> 01:13:18.320]   We are heirs with Christ, bought by His blood.
[01:13:18.320 --> 01:13:27.520]   Oh, how great the love that we've been shown,
[01:13:27.520 --> 01:13:39.720]   when Your children come, You made us Your own.
[01:13:39.720 --> 01:13:45.920]   We are strangers, we are strangers to You.
[01:13:45.920 --> 01:13:50.520]   We are no strangers to You.
[01:13:50.520 --> 01:14:00.020]   We draw near You now with confidence, for all our fears are gone.
[01:14:00.020 --> 01:14:09.020]   With Christ the King, we too will be saints with You.
[01:14:09.020 --> 01:14:20.520]   And forever we will be Your things, for You made us Your own.
[01:14:20.520 --> 01:14:29.520]   You have loved us like You loved Your Son.
[01:14:29.520 --> 01:14:38.520]   We are heirs with Christ, bought by His blood.
[01:14:38.520 --> 01:14:47.520]   Oh, how great the love that we've been shown,
[01:14:47.520 --> 01:14:55.520]   when Your children come, You made us Your own.
[01:14:55.520 --> 01:15:06.520]   You have loved us like You loved Your Son.
[01:15:06.520 --> 01:15:15.520]   We are heirs with Christ, bought by His blood.
[01:15:15.520 --> 01:15:25.020]   Oh, how great the love that we've been shown,
[01:15:25.020 --> 01:15:34.520]   when Your children come, when Your children come,
[01:15:34.520 --> 01:15:47.020]   when Your children come, You made us Your own.
[01:15:47.020 --> 01:15:49.020]   Let's pray.
[01:15:49.020 --> 01:15:51.020]   Philippians 2, 1 and 2.
[01:15:51.020 --> 01:15:54.020]   Therefore, if there is any encouragement in Christ,
[01:15:54.020 --> 01:15:56.020]   if there is any consolation of love,
[01:15:56.020 --> 01:15:58.520]   if there is any fellowship of the Spirit,
[01:15:58.520 --> 01:16:01.020]   if there is any affection and compassion,
[01:16:01.020 --> 01:16:04.020]   make my joy complete by being of the same mind,
[01:16:04.020 --> 01:16:09.520]   maintain the same love, united in spirit, intent on one purpose.
[01:16:09.520 --> 01:16:13.020]   Lord, help us to apply this in our lives,
[01:16:13.020 --> 01:16:16.520]   that our confession would be more than just words.
[01:16:16.520 --> 01:16:19.020]   I pray that You would build up this church in one mind,
[01:16:19.020 --> 01:16:22.520]   in one spirit, in one purpose, in one obedience,
[01:16:22.520 --> 01:16:25.020]   that Christ may be exalted,
[01:16:25.020 --> 01:16:29.520]   that this world that has been lost may see the light in Christ,
[01:16:29.520 --> 01:16:34.020]   that more and more and more people may come into the light,
[01:16:34.020 --> 01:16:36.520]   that they may also be our family,
[01:16:36.520 --> 01:16:40.520]   for the sake of Your glory and for the sake of the lost.
[01:16:40.520 --> 01:16:43.520]   In Jesus' name we pray, amen.
[01:16:43.520 --> 01:16:53.020]   God sent His Son, a golden Jesus
[01:16:53.020 --> 01:17:02.020]   He came to love, heal and forgive
[01:17:02.020 --> 01:17:11.520]   He lived and died to buy my garden
[01:17:11.520 --> 01:17:21.020]   An empty grave is there to fill, a sacred land
[01:17:21.020 --> 01:17:30.020]   Because He lived, I can face tomorrow
[01:17:30.020 --> 01:17:39.520]   Because He lived, all fear is gone
[01:17:39.520 --> 01:17:48.520]   Because I know, He holds the future
[01:17:48.520 --> 01:17:57.020]   And life is worth the living, just because He lived
[01:17:57.020 --> 01:18:05.520]   Never seen what heart could fathom such boundless grace
